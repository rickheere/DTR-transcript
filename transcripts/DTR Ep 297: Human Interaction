00:00 [Music]
00:33 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:35 gentlemen today we're gonna talk about
00:38 human interaction I'm actually surprised
00:43 it took me this long to come up with
00:44 this subject matter because it's
00:45 something that we are all talking about
00:47 a lot and I think there's a lot more to
00:53 it than we really get into in
00:59 conversations so you're sitting around
01:02 talking to someone and the older you are
01:04 the more the conversation starts and it
01:07 becomes very easy to have which is that
01:12 with all the social media that we have
01:14 out there we tend to grow content with
01:17 electronic communication for a lot of us
01:20 we remember time before social media now
01:24 if you live in a small town you don't
01:28 really need this lesson you don't
01:32 because you hang out with human beings
01:35 oh you might have your Instagram
01:38 whatever but you might in a small town
01:41 what happens is you post something then
01:42 you go down to the local restaurant a
01:44 local bar or local hangout and you go
01:45 did you see what I posted you call them
01:48 up on the phone did you see what I
01:49 posted in the big city you post and then
01:56 you only know if someone saw it if they
01:58 liked your little thing before we go too
02:04 far down this this whole thing imagine
02:08 the fact that the the populace that
02:11 controls the
02:13 Asians in this country the United States
02:14 of America if they got rid of the
02:17 electoral college for instance you have
02:19 the west coast and the East Coast
02:20 determines all of the policies for
02:23 pretty much 90% of the rest of this
02:25 country's geographical population and
02:29 they're the ones that are strung out not
02:31 talking to each other they don't know
02:33 their neighbors are terrified of the
02:35 universe and they're gonna pass laws
02:39 they're going to rain down upon
02:41 communities in the Midwest that have
02:43 their [ __ ] together socially speaking
02:47 just want to throw that out there before
02:49 we before I lose the point right but I
02:53 mentioned a couple times in season one
02:54 and season two I don't know if I've done
02:57 this in season three I think I have the
03:01 sheer importance of human interaction
03:06 now let's back up here and go for the
03:12 two different theories of how we got
03:14 here on this planet there's technically
03:16 a third but you have your evolutionists
03:20 and you have your creationists you're
03:25 intelligent elegent design people I
03:28 personally think we were very
03:30 intelligently designed and sometimes
03:33 there's a mezzanine in the middle which
03:34 is where intelligently designed but
03:36 we're designed by aliens right doesn't
03:38 really solve the problem of where the
03:40 hell they came for him it's still kind
03:42 of a passive evolutionary model but
03:46 regardless of what you believe about
03:48 where we came from there's one thing
03:51 that you cannot solve with social media
03:55 an electronic communication with other
03:58 people over direct interaction with
04:01 other human beings in no way did
04:06 evolution intend for man to be
04:08 communicating like this meaning all the
04:12 systems that we would have developed
04:14 through evolution we're not meant to be
04:18 isolated if you're evolutionists what do
04:21 you believe you believe that homo sapien
04:23 sapiens split off from hominid
04:26 but they still exist right monkey still
04:29 exists but we evolved from monkeys right
04:31 it's one of the greatest [ __ ]
04:34 connections there but let's just go with
04:39 that
04:40 really remedial theory okay everything
04:46 that is similar to us as related to us
04:50 by evolutionists they are pack animals
04:55 chimpanzees all hang out together man
04:57 they can't stop touching each other
04:59 every form of every monkey and ape
05:02 primate is constantly grooming each
05:06 other okay if you believe that God
05:14 created us well I don't think we have to
05:16 go too much further in that conversation
05:18 I don't think God is gonna you know is
05:21 what's funny is if you manage to
05:24 manifest some sort of definition of
05:26 heaven beyond you know the symbolic
05:29 nosov it you know sit around and eat
05:30 cake all day or whatever do whatever you
05:32 want can you imagine heaven just being a
05:35 big app well there's an app for that
05:37 what do you mean well you get to heaven
05:39 and there's just you get this really
05:41 cool iPhone that never loses a charge
05:43 it's really fast there's no more
05:45 progress bars if you want to talk to
05:47 someone else in heaven will you just
05:49 launch the heaven app that's all it's on
05:50 the phone is just a heaven app and you
05:52 can just post and share and Papapa you
05:58 get little Cupid's instead of hearts it
06:02 sounds pretty stupid doesn't it sounds
06:05 stupid because no creator in the
06:07 universe whatever create a society a
06:10 civilization or a species that would be
06:14 intended to be away from each other have
06:18 how have we survived in the history of
06:20 the world have you ever read a story
06:24 about the one man that created this
06:25 whole civilization all by himself the
06:28 one guy that built the whole fortress of
06:31 the city or the one guy that spawned the
06:33 one person which was still himself to
06:36 keep society going to keep mankind going
06:39 Oh No so he's got to be a guy and a girl
06:43 and they copulate she gets pregnant and
06:47 that's how they keep it going there's no
06:49 other combination sorry everybody else
06:51 that's just the way it's been okay no
06:57 did mr. cavemen play a Sam Cooke album
07:00 get his woman all wet no probably not
07:03 right more like that cartoon bangs
07:06 around the head and goes for it such a
07:10 horrible thing when I was a kid that
07:11 that visual was in everything came in
07:15 it's a girl in the head drags her off by
07:17 her hair yeah
07:18 first as soon as you hit her on the head
07:19 she's [ __ ] dead or brain-damaged and
07:22 that's pretty much the end of that but I
07:25 have this example I give it's not even
07:29 an analogy it's an example that I give
07:31 and when I am able to give it in a
07:35 really good scenario people are
07:37 listening there's not a lot of Cross
07:39 shatters not too much noise it's an
07:41 intimate setting and I have a
07:42 conversation with someone a lot of times
07:46 I've done this with couples you see it
07:50 on their face when I give this example
07:52 because instantaneously they know I'm
07:55 correct and instantaneously I see them
07:59 taking inventory of their investment in
08:02 social media
08:04 sometimes I see alarm on their face of
08:06 like oh [ __ ] he's right I think I need
08:11 to re-engineer my life back to the way
08:15 it was before the internet created
08:16 social media an example goes like this
08:21 I first well we first get into the
08:25 conversation about how important it is
08:27 to have human interaction and how
08:29 wonderful it feels and they're you know
08:32 they agree with me looking at me and
08:34 they're smiling okay good and then I
08:36 tell them I say look if I bought you a
08:42 16 K television it's only 50 inch so
08:46 it's really dense it has the most
08:49 perfect whites and the perfect blacks
08:51 and I surround you with an Atlas V sound
08:54 system it's going to hit you from every
08:57 single angle you're gonna feel like
09:01 you're wherever the source microphones
09:04 are it's perfect
09:06 and I sit you down for a Skype session
09:09 with your loved one of all loved ones
09:12 and you guys talk you can see them
09:17 photographically you can hear them like
09:19 they're in the room they drop a pin over
09:20 here and you hear it fall over here it
09:24 won't shake a stick towards being in the
09:28 same room with them staring at each
09:31 other two feet away on a sofa saying
09:34 absolutely nothing the human body knows
09:39 the difference between reality and
09:41 facsimile because when we're together
09:45 there's a hell of a lot more going on
09:47 between human beings than just sight and
09:51 sound touch and taste there is an
09:55 amazing emotional arc between us as
09:57 human beings and it is the way we are
10:01 built it is the way we're supposed to be
10:04 together
10:05 it feeds us socially it feeds us
10:09 spiritually haven't you ever had a hug
10:12 and you would swear to god the ther is
10:17 some machine hooked to your chest and
10:20 the second your chest touches their
10:23 chest you have this amazing feeling it's
10:28 this rewarding sensation of being with
10:32 another human being and sometimes you
10:34 can say well if it's your lover man it's
10:37 like on 10 especially if you haven't
10:40 seen him in a while or you just had a
10:43 super bad day and you hug them and you
10:46 literally touch chests it's this nuclear
10:50 bomb of amazing feeling how's that for
10:56 mixing metaphors you ever gonna get that
10:59 from a Skype session from our Google
11:01 hangout the feeling can be likened to
11:05 replenishing your soul as if their cup
11:09 is filling your cup and vice versa if
11:11 you were the right person I've told the
11:14 story couple times and I learned this
11:16 the hard way when I moved to California
11:19 in 1987 it was a very sobering thing for
11:26 me I came here the 19th it was ten days
11:32 before my birthday in August and I spent
11:37 my 18th birthday in this room I was
11:39 renting reading Stephen King's misery I
11:42 wasn't on work that day my buddy comes
11:45 home from work and realizes my birthday
11:48 and then I never had to tell anyone it
11:50 was my birthday in my entire life and I
11:53 had just spent the day you know reading
11:55 this very McCobb novel which was about a
11:59 guy isolated he's being tortured by this
12:01 lady and it's you know something that
12:04 was a great book so he grabs me and we
12:07 go out and grab some food hanging out
12:11 but this went on and on and Here I am in
12:14 a place I want to be
12:15 I am succeeding beyond my wildest dreams
12:18 and I'm succeeding at a pace that's
12:19 insane just I wouldn't say following
12:24 uphill because I worked my ass off but
12:26 everything was going right and
12:28 everything continued going right for
12:29 years and years but it was not until
12:31 probably about June the next year 1988
12:35 to count up the months it was about ten
12:39 months right my friend that I was
12:44 renting a room with at the time he was
12:45 running across the hallway at a Moorpark
12:49 California he goes you want to see a my
12:51 buddy's music studio cuz he saw me with
12:53 all my music equipment I said hell yeah
12:55 I want to see it he said okay he said
12:59 meet me here and it was his church group
13:02 and so he suckered me into a church to
13:07 get to this studio I was fine with me
13:10 was an awesome Church awesome people now
13:13 full disclosure the dude on the studio
13:15 ended up getting busted for pedophilia
13:18 two years after I left it's been two
13:20 years in prison
13:22 prior to that he got his PhD at
13:24 Pepperdine University and was a Bible
13:26 instructor you know Wow right but the
13:31 key of the story is that I went to this
13:32 church and I went one time and I went to
13:37 the studio and it was cool and he gave
13:39 me you know he said you know you can
13:41 rent time for me I said great so I
13:43 started writing my first real pro stuff
13:45 you know and then I think it was the
13:49 second or third visit I'm there and you
13:52 know when new comer arrives at a church
13:55 you never know if they're ever gonna
13:56 come back you know and I was definitely
13:59 like this nomadic kid I had no parents
14:00 no friends I was just there I was
14:03 working literally down the street and
14:05 you know I figured out what I was doing
14:07 and they're like well it's you sure how
14:08 old are you what's you know did you go
14:10 to college what's going on here
14:12 that's when I came back one of the
14:16 elders who I ended up living with later
14:17 on his family big guy
14:20 sizing my dad right about 6-2 or so just
14:24 just an unbelievable soul to this day
14:27 still the same way he takes one look at
14:30 me and he's like oh you're back and he
14:33 reaches his arm around me he gives you
14:35 this big hug like a you know big dad hug
14:37 you know and my body I don't know how
14:42 you describe it it was about every
14:47 emotion you could possibly have and I
14:49 had visited home for probably Christmas
14:51 that year I saw my family he used me his
14:54 big bear hug my buddy just electrified
14:57 that somebody was touching me and I come
15:02 from a really huggy you know lovey
15:04 family and he walkie and you hug you
15:06 kiss and you sit down and then you eat
15:08 your whatever lunch dinner breakfast
15:10 whatever at least the grandmothers were
15:12 that way and I realized at that point
15:15 way before the internet got HTTP
15:18 protocol and web pages and social media
15:21 that that's extremely important thing
15:24 that we must preserve an incubate where
15:28 else have we seen this becoming a very
15:31 important
15:32 thing well for those of you in America
15:35 you're definitely familiar with our
15:37 prison system or maybe you're not let me
15:40 make sure you understand in America
15:43 there is something called a jail a jail
15:45 is where you go before you get sentenced
15:47 a prison is where you go after you get
15:49 sentenced you get credit for time you
15:51 spent in jail waiting for your sentence
15:54 but would you aren't when you're in jail
15:56 you have what's called segregation or
16:01 admin add sag which could be
16:03 administration administrative
16:05 segregation or the holes what they call
16:08 it - there's different levels
16:10 administration segregation is a little
16:12 bit lighter that lets you have a little
16:13 more stuff in the room and it depends on
16:15 what state you're in it depends on what
16:16 prison you're in depends on what jail
16:17 you're in but when you cross problems
16:20 they put you away for an attitude
16:22 correction now the good news is is that
16:27 this country is reforming some of those
16:30 standards because it's become pretty
16:32 inhumane
16:33 too much time away from other human
16:36 beings with absolutely no way to
16:38 stimulate the mind of course they're
16:39 trying to sway the behaviors of some of
16:42 these people and it does work boy it
16:44 cracks the toughest of the tough
16:46 they go insane you know it's like The
16:48 Breakfast Club thing is like two weeks
16:51 oh okay three weeks who cares you know
16:54 four weeks you know man
16:55 the whole cleans people up I've seen it
16:57 you know watch Netflix lock up man
16:59 you'll see these guys educate you
17:02 there's so much to be learned by the
17:04 show lock up and it's just nuts these
17:07 guys go in you see that what they do
17:09 with their lives you see how they
17:10 correct themselves you see how they keep
17:12 themselves screwed up someone getting
17:13 arrested some of them die it's a it's a
17:17 lot of wisdom in there but what is up
17:20 happening and we all know what happens
17:21 and again European prisons are a lot
17:23 more humane from what I've seen now
17:25 third-world prisons are all over the map
17:28 right we just don't know what you're
17:29 getting into and you get put in jail or
17:31 prison in a foreign country which means
17:33 behave okay but what ends up happening
17:36 is some of my going for six months and
17:39 end up getting a hundred years the
17:43 they don't know how to behave they're
17:45 only in there for six months so they
17:46 take liberties with their behavior they
17:48 get put in the hole then they start
17:50 turning into a monster if they don't
17:55 sanction their brains and and keep their
17:59 wits about them they become monsters in
18:02 prison and then they go back at general
18:07 population and they commit a horrible
18:10 crime which gets him the hundred years I
18:13 watch the episode the other day guy went
18:15 there for four years within the four
18:18 years okay but she wouldn't have served
18:20 the entire for the way it works in
18:22 America if you're a good guy in prison
18:23 you treat everybody with respect you
18:25 don't cause any problems you can get out
18:27 in as short as a year and a half of
18:29 probation but no this guy goes in for
18:33 four years and gets himself 142
18:39 participated in prison riots which got
18:43 police officers injured some of them
18:45 critically
18:46 inmates getting killed I mean it's
18:48 horrible part of the genesis of his
18:51 behavior was isolation now what's
18:54 interesting about this experiment and I
18:58 mentioned this analogy from time to time
18:59 but it's actually a thing that you do
19:01 what happens when you get a new piece of
19:03 electronic equipment or a new piece of
19:06 software but you end up doing if you got
19:10 a knob or a slider and you're not quite
19:13 sure what it does you're playing around
19:14 some your some effects package and when
19:18 your computer's an After Effects thing
19:20 you got a knob on a machine you'll take
19:23 it and you'll crank it all the way to
19:25 one side and then crank it back and you
19:26 try to watch what's happening oh how the
19:28 flame got a lot bigger no I know how to
19:30 work a gas oven don't want to do that
19:32 randomly right but that's how we figure
19:35 out how things work when we look at the
19:39 people in prison on these shows we're
19:43 looking at people who slam the knob to
19:46 10:00 and get themselves 142 years on
19:51 top of a 4-year sentence
19:56 well what are we doing with our life
19:58 you're saying well that I don't know why
19:59 you're mentioning that I'm not in prison
20:01 I'm not in a jail cell
20:03 I'll never do anything to get into that
20:05 okay I believe you I do well let's think
20:09 about it if we can see what happens to a
20:13 human being who slams it to 10:00 and
20:16 gets themselves 142 years what happens
20:18 to us slowly over time if we simply feed
20:22 ourselves the poison of isolation
20:25 without interaction with that physical
20:28 touch
20:29 slowly it gets worse and worse and worse
20:34 we become more and more isolated now
20:38 when I say this I'm not saying you
20:41 shouldn't be comfortable in your own
20:42 skin I'm not saying that you shouldn't
20:44 be able to be at home by yourself and
20:46 totally enjoy that that's that's a
20:49 euphoric state it really is when you can
20:52 be your own person I find that in
20:55 history of my own life the more that I
20:58 can be totally happy at home and sit
21:01 there for 10 hours just cleaning up the
21:03 house working doing my emails doing
21:06 creative stuff that's when I meet the
21:08 most interesting people in my life
21:10 because I'm interesting because I've
21:12 worked on myself I feel really confident
21:14 if I walk into a room
21:15 I'm totally centered that's when I meet
21:19 someone it's interesting when you have
21:23 someone at home that you see all the
21:25 time that's when you actually become
21:27 more of a couch potato and there's
21:29 nothing wrong with that because you have
21:31 built a life out of your family your
21:34 spouse your kids whatever I think about
21:38 this scenario
21:39 this is totally fictitious but maybe
21:42 there's some truth to it as well now
21:46 let's say University somewhere out there
21:48 in the truth world there's a little I
21:51 don't know analysis on social media on
21:55 isolation and they start tracking health
21:59 issues related to isolation as a result
22:04 of social media they not only study
22:08 adults which is
22:09 most likely where they would go but
22:11 they'll also study kids they study the
22:13 elderly maybe sometimes when you have
22:16 absolutely nothing interaction on the
22:19 phone is actually positive for you for a
22:22 child who needs to develop interpersonal
22:24 skills perhaps it is totally
22:26 debilitating for you for an adult it
22:29 just depends where are you in life there
22:33 might be this weird gradient but what if
22:38 there was a fairly giant demographic
22:41 maybe a thirty year span a three decade
22:45 span let's say from thirty to sixty they
22:50 came back and said they fatality rate in
22:53 suicide rate of people engaged in
22:56 massive social media and zero
22:58 interaction with other human beings
23:00 results in death they go to their
23:07 doctors they get on antidepressants the
23:09 antidepressants completely shut down all
23:11 their normal chemical manufacturing and
23:13 their brain then they try to get off the
23:16 drug and they go nuts they hurt
23:18 themselves there's somebody else what if
23:21 this came out in the press and you could
23:24 read an article from sources that you
23:26 trust would you change your life at all
23:29 in terms of social media interaction I
23:32 know friends that are stuck at home mmm
23:37 some have families they still live
23:40 online all night long all day long their
23:44 life is at least 50% social media and
23:50 because they're my friends they want to
23:52 talk to me throughout the day and they
23:54 don't empathetically think about my
23:55 schedule at any point in time my friends
23:58 who know me in person they sort of
24:02 understand well I know a guy with this
24:06 name and we used to spend a lot of time
24:08 together because our circles you know
24:10 got it you know intertwined but now I
24:12 have to reach out if I want to hear his
24:14 voice because he's so busy it's just
24:17 tough to get ahold of them you know I'm
24:20 constantly interacting the people
24:21 constantly
24:23 part of it is what I like to do for a
24:25 living part of is because I integrated
24:29 into my life a circle of friends that I
24:31 go in a circle throughout the week
24:35 different environments different things
24:37 you know one guy a marathon and watch
24:39 old sitcoms the other ones I go and
24:42 watch conspiracy videos and movies other
24:45 people I go out to dinner with the
24:50 female the male's I keep in check then I
24:54 have my work associates that I work with
24:56 amazing peers that you know tax my brain
25:00 constantly use every single skill that
25:02 I've got in the book it's a blast right
25:05 but what's funny is I think people think
25:10 that I'm ignoring them they take offense
25:12 because I don't engage in all the social
25:15 media anymore I've got three Facebook
25:18 profiles there's not a single post on
25:22 any of them I use one to manage this
25:25 channel I have an old one with all my
25:27 professional associates in them and I
25:30 had my private one it's my closest
25:32 friends some of you wrong all three of
25:38 them I'm trying to pull you guys off the
25:40 old ones onto the private one but I have
25:43 allowed myself at times to get very very
25:45 isolated and it's sort of like you know
25:50 you know we all have work and that's one
25:52 thing but you know Jesus you couldn't
25:55 you can't go to work and have normal
25:58 conversations anymore because of all the
25:59 me to horseshit that's out there right
26:01 there are people out there with true me
26:03 to problems and there's just people
26:04 trying to milk the system what did you
26:07 say to me well you know that word you
26:10 used if I look up the etymology from
26:11 1822 that means something really hideous
26:14 and I'm gonna take offense to it I'm
26:15 gonna try to get a million dollars out
26:17 of the company's insurance policies that
26:19 kind of crap screwing up the world
26:23 nice try to fix that one that's a
26:25 different episode not sure how to fix it
26:31 everyone's so strung out on it it's
26:33 become a part of our social fabric the
26:36 only hope that we have I think in my
26:38 opinion is that the next generation
26:40 denies it and says you know what that's
26:43 corny old crap that my dad used to do my
26:45 mom used to do it's what my grandma
26:48 grandpa like I don't why I have anything
26:50 to do with that I like going outside you
26:53 have Sun hit my face I like to use a
26:56 skateboard I like rollerskating rinks I
26:59 like going down to I don't know local
27:03 restaurant a convenience store it's
27:07 interesting when you go down to some of
27:09 the more urban areas you have people to
27:11 hang out in front of the local liquor
27:13 store or convenience store both right
27:16 now there's a lot of stereotypes about
27:17 the folks that do that no drug trades
27:21 used to hang out the same locations but
27:23 you know way before drugs or a huge
27:25 issue in this country it was just the
27:28 way you had conversations with the local
27:31 people in the town I think one of the
27:35 easiest ways to fix this problem is to
27:37 look back if you're old enough to your
27:39 childhood you're you know maybe in your
27:45 late 50s or even older you're gonna have
27:47 a thousand different examples of where
27:49 you used to hang out to interact with
27:52 other people for those of you who are
27:55 religious and go to church I think
27:56 that's a pretty good one hanging out
27:58 with like-minded people makes it happen
28:00 for those of you who have clubs little
28:04 meetup org sort of things right I'm
28:08 involved with one of them here locally
28:10 for electronics I'm about to get into
28:12 another one that's going to be about
28:13 artificial intelligence and we'll see
28:16 means you're forming budding one of
28:19 them's forming ones three years old but
28:22 no matter you know people come and go so
28:23 these things renew themselves renew
28:26 their own formats and etc right like I
28:29 said when I was a kid I was taken to a
28:32 black rib joint on the east side of my
28:35 town called Armas and you know my
28:38 parents would hang out with Irma
28:41 upstairs on the second floor having
28:43 conversations with her
28:45 my dad and I would hang out with Roy he
28:47 cooked the food outside a big giant pit
28:49 I just was this little kid man I just
28:52 listened to all the conversations but
28:53 there was a point where I got to stay
28:55 downstairs in the billiard room and
28:57 drinks you know coca-cola these tiny
28:59 little bottles tiny little glass balls
29:02 this old Coke machine right out of
29:05 fallout 3 I just sit and watch I see
29:09 these guys you know rib each other and
29:12 all this other stuff then when I got a
29:13 little bit older there was you know the
29:15 pool parlors there were the bars the bar
29:18 pool parlors people interacted yeah sure
29:24 some guys got in fistfights and beat the
29:26 [ __ ] out of each other just kind of sit
29:29 and watch and learn and learn how to
29:32 control yourself so you don't get in the
29:33 same problem when I was a kid we had
29:36 arcades right go see the episode and see
29:40 someone if you dig arcades it's a lot of
29:42 fun we used to hang out
29:45 it was just what you did me when I was a
29:50 kid it was nine years old I was living
29:51 this apartment complex this two-story
29:53 buildings I'm in the second floor and
29:55 they used to look out my window at night
29:57 especially in the summertime and you'd
29:59 see the window wide open it kind of had
30:01 to to survive and I'd looked down on
30:04 this playground that was meant for us as
30:05 kids but at night these guys would back
30:08 up this truck with the tailgate down and
30:11 they just have to tailgate parties and
30:13 they weren't you know it was probably
30:16 like eight start around ten o'clock
30:17 they'd probably drink till like 2:00 in
30:19 the morning and no one called the cops
30:21 because they were polite they just kind
30:24 of talked every once while they'd laugh
30:26 but you know a comfortable laugh is not
30:29 something that was going to complain
30:30 about but that's what they did people
30:34 used to go out and fish sit there a nice
30:39 little folding chair with your real and
30:41 your rod lie about what they caught last
30:47 week we hung out together and the amount
30:52 of wisdom that you transfer between you
30:53 two human beings is amazing using your
30:56 mouth right
30:58 I won't be labored but there's been
31:01 experiments for years proving that
31:03 primates transfer information without
31:05 speaking without any form of
31:07 communication they simply teach each
31:10 other through being with each other
31:12 and it spreads like a virus we do it too
31:18 it's pretty hard to learn an instrument
31:20 completely by yourself
31:22 I mean it's you can youtube video all of
31:24 the hell you want but you when you need
31:26 to ask a question it's not covered in
31:28 the YouTube video you are screwed it's a
31:31 good primer but it's not the way to
31:33 finish and polish out and become a
31:34 professional it just isn't
31:36 you need to ask questions and that's
31:39 when you need another human being but
31:42 social media has a separate side effect
31:44 that is not so good when you decide to
31:48 post on social media that is when the
31:52 inner it and the inner psychoses of your
31:58 mind kick into action why are you
32:02 posting and I mean anything Instagram to
32:06 Twitter to Facebook
32:10 what are you doing it for
32:13 I'll tell you why you do it
32:15 because there's a few things and it
32:18 almost every single post in the world
32:19 falls under this cut these categories
32:21 right one of them is look how much
32:25 better my life is than yours post a
32:28 photograph you happen to take your
32:31 vacation and you went to Paris or
32:33 something you just pound it into the
32:36 minds of everyone around you know
32:38 everyone else is gonna go someplace else
32:40 at some point in time so maybe you
32:42 balance it out in your brain but a lot
32:44 of times it's a big you know show-off
32:47 post we're all guilty of this okay
32:52 mm-hmm the other one is someone loves me
32:59 post your boyfriend your girlfriend
33:02 you're posting your personal
33:04 interactions with your personal loved
33:06 ones I'll for the entire world to
33:09 consume
33:11 I'm not broken see this guy likes me I'm
33:15 not broken see there's a good-looking
33:18 girl likes me hmm does anyone really
33:22 care the other one is the bearing of bad
33:25 news people will post that someone died
33:29 a celebrity they want to be the first
33:32 person to break it to you I don't know
33:35 what their proven I watched the news all
33:37 [ __ ] day I don't know what it is but
33:40 you know when someone dies there's
33:41 50,000 posts online about that person
33:44 dying perhaps it's a coping mechanism
33:47 because they don't have any friends
33:49 right when Prince died you know I think
33:54 I told you guys the story I was
33:56 interviewing for a position at a really
33:58 cool company and I haven't even started
34:00 the interview of my phone starts blowing
34:03 up on this desk and I was like well I'm
34:05 not gonna pay attention to that crap
34:07 even though there's a break going on
34:08 between people talking to me but I kept
34:10 going and going and going and I don't
34:12 get that many texts in this world I was
34:14 like what the hell's going on maybe
34:15 there's an emergency right click on it
34:17 look inside it's like 10 individual
34:20 people it must be like 23 posts in there
34:23 and one of my friends said well one of
34:25 my friends you could be the first line
34:27 of it you know one of them says can you
34:28 believe it and I read down the next one
34:30 it said Prince died and I was like what
34:34 57 years old what the hell's going on
34:36 there right I blew this interview with
34:41 this one kid cuz he was so full of
34:42 [ __ ] [ __ ] it was ridiculous thanks
34:44 senator thanks group of people I did
34:45 well but I left he had 50% veto on the
34:48 on the interview didn't get the job
34:49 didn't really give a [ __ ] no because of
34:52 the the day that I was having and then I
34:54 ended up spending the rest of the day on
34:56 the phone talking to all my friends
34:57 right social media didn't solve it for
35:00 me didn't bring peace to my soul talking
35:04 to my friends who's lived through these
35:06 eras with me one of my friends was very
35:08 close to Prince personally and he got me
35:11 very close to Prince as well I never met
35:13 Prince unfortunately but I got one
35:16 degree away or two degrees away from the
35:18 guy you know talking to him and we're
35:21 all just shocked right the other reason
35:24 why you
35:25 is to say I'm right and you were wrong
35:30 my political candidates better than
35:32 yours
35:33 or the food that you choose is wrong
35:36 right does that bring anyone to the
35:39 table ever not really
35:43 there'll be a few people that totally
35:44 respect your opinion and they might go
35:47 really that bad and you're like yeah I
35:49 found out it's been thought I would
35:51 share so I don't think that social media
35:55 as a whole and perhaps it's because of
35:57 our immaturity is bringing out the very
35:59 best in us I think it's making us all
36:03 look like a bunch of [ __ ] a bunch of
36:06 children the most sophisticated people I
36:10 know don't post it's interesting they
36:12 just don't do it if they do they're
36:15 trying to share something beautiful
36:18 right of course you get the other one
36:22 that says you know if you don't share
36:25 this post of Jesus you're an [ __ ]
36:26 that's the other great one oh okay okay
36:29 so I don't want to post your thing on my
36:32 feet cuz I think it was annoying you did
36:34 it in the first place and now what are
36:37 you gonna think of me right it's one of
36:39 those jokes where you say I posted this
36:40 on my on my feed because you said if I
36:44 didn't I was a jerk said no one ever
36:46 all right LinkedIn is another famous one
36:52 LinkedIn is is a good way to probably
36:55 stay stay in contact with your
36:57 professional friends but it's never
37:00 going to lead to you getting a job right
37:02 I hired you because of your amazing
37:04 profile on LinkedIn said no no employer
37:06 ever right but you get these blowhards
37:09 on LinkedIn that just are these
37:11 self-appointed authorities and they just
37:13 I don't know man they just post articles
37:16 and post their own stuff and none of us
37:19 informed if no none of its interesting
37:21 none of its profound but that's what
37:24 they're trying to accomplish and this is
37:29 the thing about social media that I
37:30 think is hilarious you'll have a person
37:33 who's in their 60s behaving like a child
37:35 in social media and not all mean child
37:39 in the posting kitty cat videos all the
37:41 time or whatever now I'm talking about
37:43 trying to be something that they're not
37:48 manifesting this notion and it's not
37:51 something that you that well I should
37:53 say this bunch it's not something I
37:55 don't think that they really want to be
37:56 in the first place even if they achieve
37:57 their goal there is a way of pretending
38:00 to be the person that you want to be and
38:01 then you'll be that prince said that
38:02 himself he said look I was very shy
38:04 wasn't very confident and when I got on
38:07 stage I pretended to be that way and
38:09 eventually over the course of five years
38:10 or so I realized I really could be that
38:14 person so he pretended his way into what
38:17 he wanted to be so there's there's a
38:18 formula that can work there I don't
38:20 think you're gonna achieve it through
38:21 Facebook this selfie is really
38:23 interesting it's probably the one I'm
38:26 the most guilty of out of all the
38:28 formulas taking a picture of yourself
38:33 that you like editing it changing its
38:36 color changing whatever and posting it
38:39 out there for the world to see this is
38:41 me it can have its advantages I think
38:47 its disadvantages we all know there's a
38:50 certain level of selfies then it's
38:51 different for every one of us where we
38:53 start to believe the other person's and
38:54 narcissists oh my god what do you just
38:57 sit around taking pictures of yourself
38:59 and a part of it could be that you're
39:01 trying to reinvent yourself and so
39:03 selfies are very healthy for getting out
39:04 there and looking at yourself and going
39:07 you know I'm gonna try my hair like this
39:09 I'm trying to hair like that I'm gonna
39:10 wear clothes like this I'm gonna try
39:13 these sunglasses I'm gonna try some
39:14 smiling smirking not smiling
39:17 should I be funny in a photo some people
39:20 are utterly shameless and I think it's
39:22 phenomenal how they can do that they
39:24 post things I would never post it myself
39:26 I envy them YouTube is very interesting
39:30 because it has a sub-element of social
39:32 media they'll post a video online and
39:37 they want everyone to like it when the
39:40 second if someone doesn't like it
39:41 there's this knee-jerk butthurt a real
39:45 painful thing in the chest and then they
39:48 try to engage well some people walk away
39:50 because they realized that's just the
39:52 way it works
39:53 right I probably get thumbs down because
39:56 it's too long I probably get thumbs down
39:59 because it's a black and white I get
40:02 thumbs down because I swear I probably
40:04 get thumbs down because I pick a
40:07 particular subject where I like it and
40:10 people hate it it's just gonna be the
40:13 way it is but some people will post off
40:18 very sort of you know polarizing topics
40:22 right no politician in this day and age
40:25 answers the question what is your belief
40:27 on abortion Supreme Court justice people
40:32 don't answer that question anymore
40:34 because they instantaneously know
40:35 they're going to fail to bring over the
40:38 majority to their side it's probably the
40:41 most polarizing subject you matter you
40:42 could possibly get into the people will
40:46 take subjects not that subject but
40:48 subjects just as polarizing and do
40:51 videos on them and when the world
40:53 doesn't like them oh my god they will
40:57 take one video and make ten more videos
41:00 trying to convince the world that
41:02 they're not a bad person that you should
41:05 still like them and it just feeds the
41:08 trolls and they don't get it
41:10 they'll even be told by their closest
41:12 friends don't do it don't do it you're
41:14 gonna get more trolls and they're just
41:16 blind they're just completely ignorant
41:18 if not stupid about it and they just
41:21 just have to do this you know because
41:23 they've never experienced dissent
41:26 face-to-face right now some might argue
41:29 that's healthy that person needs to grow
41:32 up I wouldn't disagree what happens when
41:36 you build your circle of friends
41:37 carefully I have a episode on friendship
41:40 which doesn't get watched that much but
41:42 it's actually fairly important a lot of
41:45 details in it but we tend to build
41:48 circles around us that are positive not
41:52 negative anyone who's against you just
41:54 needs to be filtered out you can get to
41:58 the point where you walk up to their
41:59 face and you say look I don't think this
42:01 is a healthy relationship that we have
42:03 or you can just not call them back
42:06 yeah just don't make him feel bad about
42:08 themselves you just have a difference
42:10 it's something you can't reconcile and
42:13 so you just don't invite them
42:15 [ __ ] happens Ben the thing is this this
42:21 is a big world out there and there's a
42:22 big life to live when you're on your
42:26 deathbed all of this shit's going to
42:29 matter in the end what did you do with
42:33 your life
42:35 imagine you die put this way imagine
42:39 facebook removes the five thousand
42:41 friend cap on your account why they give
42:44 a [ __ ] how many friends you have I don't
42:46 understand but let's say you had a
42:48 million friends ten million subscribers
42:52 on YouTube that you haven't met a single
42:55 soul in your lifetime ninja deathbed all
43:00 this stuff is long gone man you lived a
43:03 pretty good life I guess terms of age
43:05 you didn't get hit by a bus you didn't
43:07 die of some acute illness but you're
43:11 dying alone because you never made a
43:15 friend never even tried like you never
43:19 had them thought of us are gonna
43:21 probably die by ourselves who knows
43:23 right your spouse passes away year
43:26 before you do your kids I don't know
43:28 they're just in different part of the
43:30 world they come in they came in slow
43:31 yesterday they got to go back to work
43:33 and so you're gonna be in that old folks
43:35 home whatever you know I've had two two
43:39 grandparents passed away completely by
43:41 themselves to the most wonderful women
43:43 I've ever met in my life they passed
43:46 away by themselves and there's really
43:47 nothing that any of us could have done
43:49 to have been there besides to have lived
43:51 right next to them every single day but
43:55 when you go out there's gonna be a
43:58 moment where you kind of surmise what
44:02 did I do with my life did I live it or
44:05 did I
44:07 perpetuate a facsimile of what it was
44:10 all about it's important I think YouTube
44:15 has a distinct advantage because you can
44:19 have much deeper experiences in my
44:21 opinion we're really exchanging
44:23 information
44:24 this whole awakening of 2018 which
44:27 started a long time ago has been
44:29 facilitated by videos and audio podcasts
44:33 I don't know I think very few people
44:36 truly get deeply into podcasts this show
44:40 has about 270,000 views and some change
44:45 the podcast has and I haven't had the
44:48 data from the very beginning but you
44:51 know the podcast is around 70,000 they
44:55 add 10 grand to that you get 80,000 it's
44:58 still no matter how much you pad that
45:00 thing it's going to be half so this is a
45:02 powerful platform as a little bit more
45:06 dimension it comes with a lot less
45:10 I think immediate psychosis because it's
45:14 not this hit and run thing
45:16 social media is the pure social medias
45:19 they're just hit and runs you tweet boom
45:21 you're gone you Instagram you're gone
45:23 you're Facebook you're gone human
45:27 interaction is extremely extremely
45:29 important to the your overall health I
45:33 don't think we have enough data to say
45:35 well if you don't get human interaction
45:37 you literally stop functioning as a
45:41 human being now I don't think that's
45:43 true necessarily but if any of you've
45:48 even remotely toiled with the notion you
45:56 watch some post-apocalyptic show Walking
45:58 Dead you see some some movie like that
46:02 where the world is sort of reset and of
46:05 course when they write a story that's
46:06 fictional everyone has a partner and
46:08 there's a story going on but could just
46:11 as easily happen when you have no one
46:14 everyone that you know isn't available
46:15 they're all dead they're too scary to
46:18 get next to you just don't know and you
46:21 sit there and you think about it there's
46:23 something called cabin fever for a
46:25 reason you become stir-crazy as they say
46:29 now I personally believe that if you
46:32 allow yourself to hear your inner voice
46:34 you can survive this kind of thing a lot
46:37 longer than others nice to have a friend
46:40 of mine that would hike you might still
46:43 do it but he hikes and one of his things
46:45 is he says that people are just
46:47 terrified to hear the voices inside
46:49 their head they're terrified hearing
46:52 their inner voice and he said that he
46:55 would dig a hike and he'd see people
46:57 wearing headsets hiking and every once
47:00 while he'd stop and he goes why are you
47:02 wearing a headset out here in nature
47:04 what's the point I'm not talking about
47:07 people jogging or something like that he
47:08 goes you're in the most beautiful place
47:10 in the world but every time you go by
47:13 with your headset on no one's allowed to
47:16 talk to you unless it's an emergency
47:19 you are negating the rest of the world
47:22 from interfering with your little bubble
47:25 again if you're if you're running you
47:27 got a regiment you got to get your miles
47:29 in or whatever a little bit different
47:31 but he's not talking about those people
47:32 his whole frustration was why go out in
47:35 nature if the only thing you're gonna do
47:37 is negate nature while you're at it I
47:40 thought he had a great point how many
47:44 movies have you seen well there's only
47:46 one character in the entire movie or if
47:49 there's castaway there's a couple out of
47:53 all the movies I've seen in my entire
47:54 lifetime but even attempted to do that
47:58 if I took a script into Hollywood I've
48:00 got one that's actually a single dude it
48:03 will be the toughest script to write and
48:06 it will be the toughest script to ever
48:07 pitch it would have to be a crowning
48:11 achievement of my whole writing career
48:12 meaning I have to get at least you know
48:15 four or three to four movies made that
48:17 do really really well and then I submit
48:20 this one to the last second I go look
48:22 I'm 65 years old I finally nailed this
48:24 script with this one guy in it the whole
48:28 script and you'll trust me with it
48:31 because I deliver and read it of course
48:35 right I want you guys to test out the
48:39 theory of the skyping Skype with someone
48:43 special not just a random stranger
48:46 but you can test that with a random
48:47 stranger if you're fairly observant but
48:50 Skype with them and then hang out with
48:53 them if I just do it with your your
48:56 partner just say we're gonna do a little
48:58 experiment do it with your parents just
49:03 standing with them is huge I go back to
49:05 my you know high school reunion every
49:07 five years I guarantee you I can chat
49:12 with someone face to face on every
49:14 single thing facebook chats game
49:17 whatever but when I see them in real
49:19 life its magic and nothing has to be
49:22 said even and you know my thing is to
49:26 recognize that we're not built to be
49:30 this way you know this is true before
49:34 you even clicked on the episode
49:36 sometimes we have to make changes in our
49:38 lives because it's time you know it's
49:44 funny the lockups show has a very
49:46 interesting arc to it that happens a
49:48 theme that happens over and over and
49:50 you'll see someone who strung out on
49:52 alcohol or some sort of drug and they
49:56 will have been into prison so many times
49:59 that there's just a breaking point
50:03 it's what the psychologists always tell
50:05 you you can't make someone else change
50:06 they have to want to change themselves
50:08 right it's so true
50:10 so amazing but it's amazing they caught
50:13 dozens and dozens of these turning
50:16 points on camera within this series on
50:18 Netflix it's an amazing thing it's super
50:22 inspiring if you can usurp their
50:24 strength and go you know what I'm not
50:27 gonna go down that path if social media
50:30 isn't starting to wane on you and isn't
50:32 starting to get really [ __ ] old right
50:34 now then you just recently crawled out
50:36 from under a rock
50:39 it's stagnant you know I think in our
50:45 lock Facebook group we do a pretty good
50:46 job of actually sharing knowledge that
50:49 is really valuable and I think in that
50:51 scenario in a forum scenario we're
50:53 sharing all of our opinions all of our
50:55 ideas I get enlightened so
50:59 times a week for the stuff that's posted
51:01 on there again your comments on this
51:04 channel
51:05 SuperDuper enlightening you guys you
51:08 know if my knowledge is a tree that
51:10 grows with different branches and little
51:12 tiny mini branches and Leafs you guys
51:15 are the bloodline in this tree causing
51:20 it to spawn and branch in every single
51:22 direction constantly it's like a mustard
51:25 seed man so those farms still have some
51:29 strengths and some value and what's
51:33 funny is a given example the amount of
51:38 times I've had a personal conversation
51:39 with say my girlfriend based on
51:41 someone's home fee posts there has been
51:44 a positive conversation hey I saw this
51:46 positive thing in my feed and now I'm
51:49 gonna share a positive thing at dinner
51:50 and here it goes again you know here
51:52 goes the conversation it's been single
51:55 percentage single percentage but the
51:59 amount of hours that I have had
52:01 conversations with my girlfriend based
52:04 on your posts in the comment section of
52:06 YouTube or in the comments section of
52:09 the flock Facebook group is so vast I
52:13 could possibly keep counting only God
52:16 knows how many hours I have pulled out
52:19 due to those posts that you guys put on
52:20 there I'll sit there and read them sit
52:23 there in crews through them and then she
52:24 says this and then he says that it's
52:27 huge your time in this world is
52:30 infinitely valuable you know me I
52:33 believe in reincarnation I really do
52:36 still at no point of believing in
52:39 reincarnation do I believe that I'm
52:43 going to blow off my life yeah whatever
52:46 I'm coming back this this life is being
52:54 sustained by forces that I think could
52:59 be doing something else with their
53:00 effort in time I think each one of us
53:03 are being sustained by the same force
53:05 for a very good reason of which we may
53:08 never understand until we pass over and
53:10 someone goes oh that's the reason why
53:11 you were there
53:12 you know I thought so it was either that
53:13 or this you know I don't know how
53:17 enlightening Instagram is ever gonna be
53:20 or Twitter or Facebook and it's pure
53:28 form
53:29 it's pure singular form of your posts to
53:33 yourself such that other people can see
53:35 it
53:36 I don't know when you get inside of a
53:41 forum what's nice is you're with people
53:43 like yourself if you got a flat earth
53:45 thing you're gonna have another ten
53:47 people who believe the earth is flat as
53:49 well you could enjoy yourself and have
53:51 conversations and you know what you know
53:53 you're in a forum with people who
53:54 believe it's round and it's a friendly
53:57 place because you're like well they
53:58 leave me alone I'll leave them alone and
53:59 we we play checkers every once in a
54:01 while or dominoes and we talk over the
54:04 table like well you know you know you're
54:06 full of [ __ ] about this globe thing
54:08 you've never seen it from space they're
54:09 like pushing their thing every well you
54:10 know you're full of [ __ ] cuz you haven't
54:12 flown over the South Pole all this
54:14 evidence you think you have
54:15 you've never proven that either Touche
54:17 you both say well I'm gonna become an
54:20 astronaut see this ship from space and
54:22 you're gonna become a g5 pilot and
54:24 you're gonna fly a sumbitch over the
54:25 South Pole and whether in the matter if
54:27 anyone likes it or not that has value
54:30 that's interacting a little bit at least
54:34 make sure you go out and see real human
54:38 beings and have real conversations I
54:43 know some people aren't huggy people you
54:48 know what's interesting about that when
54:51 you are a person who is you know even if
54:55 you're doing the bro hugs when you're
54:58 like that you will see people who aren't
55:05 and when you learn that they aren't it's
55:09 not a surprise you're like yeah I could
55:13 tell he or she is stiff as a [ __ ]
55:16 bored little inhuman as a matter of fact
55:21 I think I've said this before but at a
55:23 smoked lounge one of the things that's
55:25 customer
55:26 is to introduce yourself when you get to
55:29 the smoke lounge you ask everyone their
55:32 name
55:32 you're shaking everyone's hand and you
55:36 tell them your name right and then you
55:40 go get your cigar and you find a place
55:42 to sit down and you ease into whatever's
55:46 happening in the room if someone is
55:48 playing a movie before you get in there
55:50 you know they're not going to change it
55:51 to your favorite show on HBO you're
55:54 gonna have to eat that movie if you
55:55 don't like it but what you're there for
55:59 is the social interaction using very
56:03 mellowing which is a cigar
56:05 I have lived let's see
56:10 31 years in California a couple months
56:15 I'll be officially 31 years coming from
56:18 again like I always say at the Midwest
56:21 when I first moved here the first three
56:23 and a half years I spent here was with
56:25 people interacting with them sharing my
56:29 life with them laughing then I moved to
56:32 the Bay Area big city much bigger 12
56:36 years I'd say out of 12 I probably spent
56:41 I don't know eight years struggling with
56:45 the native population I was very very
56:48 fortunate because three of my friends
56:50 from Southern California moved to
56:52 Northern California and then I imported
56:54 a girlfriend from the Midwest out here
56:57 so I surrounded myself with people that
56:59 understood the value of human
57:01 interaction and I was in video games and
57:03 one thing is that one of the things that
57:06 nerds understand better than everyone
57:08 else is human interaction you know
57:12 they're not into all the [ __ ] faking
57:14 who you are they're not trying to post
57:16 on on anything how great their life is
57:19 and how much is better than you they
57:21 know they're just more human I'm safe to
57:24 say it I mean nerds are awesome people
57:27 true-blue men take their shirt off and
57:29 put it on the ground so you don't have
57:30 to get your feet wet kind of people when
57:32 I moved back down here further down to
57:36 Orange County California
57:39 this is his Midwest as I've ever
57:41 experienced anywhere in the world
57:43 besides the Midwest amazing people we
57:48 watch each other's backs we care about
57:51 each other we network oh you do this
57:55 well let me hook you up with ten people
57:57 who need that boom boom boom all that
57:59 money in there
58:00 people are happy people bragging about
58:02 what you can do and you do the same for
58:04 them we just enjoy life there's a lot of
58:08 places in the world that are just like
58:09 that so get out there and get it you
58:15 know when Mark Zuckerberg went into the
58:17 Senate hearing and said among other
58:20 things that he gave away all of our data
58:23 - what is it Cambridge analytics which
58:26 is now since closed but they're still
58:28 sharing the data they took you know
58:31 millions tens of millions of posts and
58:35 that were private and made them public
58:37 we got loyal for that the loyalty for
58:40 that guy really you're gonna give that
58:43 guy money by going in and giving him
58:45 money no man he also had to admit that
58:50 his cell phone app listens to the room
58:52 without your permission I mean yeah you
58:55 granted it access to use the microphone
58:58 but most of us perceive that as they
59:00 need to actually use the microphone
59:02 right I'm telling you when he's in the
59:04 microphone to make a post do a video I
59:06 don't know he he bent the rules he
59:11 listens to the room if you mentioned an
59:13 apple pie 20 times and you start seeing
59:15 apple pie ads you don't think everyone
59:20 else is doing the same thing you're
59:22 crazy in the real world if someone
59:25 screwed you over like that you know some
59:28 places in browbeat a call Mark out and
59:30 beat the living [ __ ] out of the guy
59:31 wouldn't kill him but he certainly would
59:33 remember it and as he walked his [ __ ]
59:35 ass back home two or three miles in the
59:38 dark but online they can do it to you
59:42 then they can screw you and they can go
59:44 hide in their little fortresses up there
59:47 in Mountain View right I think most of
59:50 us realize with the truth movement
59:52 the game is to use their platform
59:53 against them until it no longer exists
59:56 and then we'll find a way to finance our
59:59 own platform
59:59 I can never move this show anywhere
60:04 because all my episodes are over an hour
60:06 and almost every service even if you pay
60:08 money won't let you go over an hour
60:11 v-mail is a little expensive I haven't
60:13 been wanting to get into that service
60:15 now let's say you're shy let's say
60:19 you're really really shy
60:21 you're like goddamn it I like I like
60:22 this episode I believe what you're
60:24 saying but man I got no people skills
60:26 because I'm really really shy okay
60:32 here's your trick the first element of
60:36 the solution is to be with other people
60:39 interacting with them that's the bonus
60:42 that's the best part of it but I'll tell
60:44 you what there are so many places that
60:46 here in Southern California where they
60:48 have internet connections restaurants
60:52 coffee shops cigar lounges as a matter
60:56 of fact we all have you know internet
60:59 hubs wherever you go perhaps the first
61:01 step is to merely get to these locations
61:03 and sit with other people and you're
61:06 thinking well I want to interact with
61:08 them okay a second formula to get that
61:13 going
61:14 naturally one let me give you a little
61:18 piece of advice from your uncle mark
61:20 make yourself very presentable okay
61:24 don't go in there with your shitty
61:26 clothes on to get your game going
61:30 dressing your nice stuff get your hair
61:34 did go and sit pick a place go to all
61:38 the places and make sure you found the
61:40 best place in your area okay place it
61:42 feels most comfortable to you because if
61:44 you feel comfortable you're going to be
61:45 comfortable to other people maybe the
61:48 panera places in your conduct crowd
61:51 maybe the coffee bean is your place
61:55 right a couple little local joints we
61:57 have in SoCal here find them one that
62:01 works for you and go all the time when
62:05 you knew that
62:06 that interaction eventually you'll
62:08 become regular and you're gonna notice
62:10 the other regulars and eventually you'll
62:13 spend so much time with those people in
62:15 the same room but eventually you're
62:17 gonna bump with them in the order line
62:18 and getting a straw getting some food
62:21 and maybe you're gonna sit next to each
62:23 other because on one particular Saturday
62:25 afternoon the place is packed and you'll
62:27 make a little comment next to them and
62:29 they'll make a comment to you and you'll
62:30 start practicing they'll start growing
62:33 on you and you'll probably find out
62:35 you're damn good at it now if you're
62:39 dude we're in the meat to era guys be
62:41 very careful just walking up to ladies
62:43 and go and hi you want to have a
62:46 10-minute conversation you don't even
62:47 know me yeah that might get you a little
62:50 bit of a creepy card there just let it
62:52 happen
62:53 make them feel familiar with you if it
62:56 somebody came one time if they want to
62:58 talk to you they'll let you know they'll
63:01 look at you all night long make sure
63:03 looking at you with inviting eyes and
63:05 not looking at you like oh my god you're
63:06 gonna kill me don't follow them outside
63:09 if you can sing go do karaoke or
63:12 something right that's a really fun way
63:15 I've seen people come in that are single
63:17 then they go up there and they just nail
63:20 karaoke and the whole place goes crazy
63:23 and as they try to walk back to wherever
63:26 they're standing in the room they're
63:29 just getting high fives people come up
63:31 to him saying you are amazing that's
63:35 another way to break the seal you find
63:38 out even people that can't sing get get
63:41 high fives too because everyone knows
63:44 what's going on the person is trying
63:47 there's no need for us to [ __ ] on their
63:49 parade maybe they get better maybe they
63:51 don't but they went up there and they
63:53 put the heart and soul in it and so we
63:56 reward that but the other one is to
64:00 maintain your empathy it's really really
64:05 good for any form of decision you make
64:09 to interact with someone empathetically
64:12 put yourself in their shoes do they look
64:15 like they want to interact with you
64:18 a lot of times some pretty awkward [ __ ]
64:20 happens when you don't read someone well
64:22 and you go up to say hi and they're just
64:24 like get away from me you know in some
64:26 way shape or form they communicate that
64:28 kind of sentiment to you observe it'll
64:34 help you calculate your move a hell of a
64:36 lot better one of the tricks of
64:39 interacting since we're sort of past the
64:41 concept of human interaction being good
64:43 is that you'll find that everyone likes
64:47 to tell you about their opinions of
64:49 things it's a cheap trick it is a total
64:53 cheap trick man getting a conversation
64:55 where you ask people their opinions
64:59 about things so you're at a restaurant
65:02 and you can be standing in line you go
65:05 what's good here what's good food here
65:09 and maybe they haven't been there at all
65:12 and so they go man I don't know I
65:13 haven't been here and then you say well
65:15 geez I haven't been here either that
65:18 looks pretty good yeah I don't know what
65:22 are you gonna get you know you start
65:23 having a conversation and if they do
65:26 know they're like old man the spaghetti
65:28 bolognaise is amazing
65:30 it's got mushroom option on is that any
65:32 good yeah that's really good too okay
65:35 thank you very much for that great we're
65:39 all trying to hive mind online aren't we
65:41 you watch these videos you know like man
65:43 this dude thinks the way I think that's
65:45 why I keep coming back though we're the
65:47 reason to come back same thing happens
65:51 in real life how fast you think we can
65:54 hivemind in person I'm gonna suggest the
65:57 science proves really fast way faster
66:01 than online how many of you guys have
66:04 watched one of my episodes and you
66:06 thought to yourself Jesus right when the
66:09 credits ruled at the end I want to have
66:12 a three-hour conversation with this dude
66:13 about that subject because there's so
66:16 much more to talk about I want to share
66:18 my stories with this person you're just
66:21 chomping at the bit to interact and you
66:25 need to know I would probably enjoy it
66:26 too this is what we have right now right
66:30 the world is a wonderful place don't
66:34 skip it don't miss it you'll hear that
66:40 saying and you'll see it all the time in
66:41 public where you see people that you
66:44 know in your opinion in my opinion - you
66:48 think oh my gosh these two people male
66:50 female whatever maybe they're really
66:53 awkward according to our personal
66:55 standards of the way a person should
66:57 look whatever we're judging the book by
67:01 the cover of course shame on us but it
67:03 happens but you see them in love with
67:05 someone it's just like them like the
67:08 female version of the dude and you're
67:10 like holy [ __ ] that's wild there really
67:14 is someone for everyone I am a total
67:17 believer in that there's someone for
67:21 everyone well that's in a love paradigm
67:24 right I will tell you that there is
67:26 someone for everyone in a conversational
67:29 paradigm in an interactive paradigm
67:32 seriously I you know I'm late to the
67:35 game with the meetup Torg thing man
67:38 don't there's an app for that just so
67:40 you know would you go on the website in
67:42 your local area and you will find that
67:45 there's some hobby either that you are
67:47 engaging in in your personal life that
67:49 you think no one else does this and you
67:52 want to meet other people that do it
67:54 there's something they'll happen once a
67:56 month or once every two months or
67:58 whatever in your area the nest sound
68:00 cool go go to it you know it might be a
68:04 sausage fest for most guys but at least
68:06 is something right maybe you learned
68:10 something maybe I'll teach something if
68:13 your job isolates you maybe think about
68:17 a change and most of time you won't have
68:20 to change the organization you just need
68:22 to change what you do get in front of
68:25 people more often get to some
68:27 administrative position you can at least
68:30 work with employees go work in a group
68:33 instead of by yourself some of you have
68:37 really busy homes so you like the
68:39 isolation at work some of you go home
68:41 alone so you wonder your work to have
68:43 more interaction either way you balance
68:46 it you figure out what you need and I'm
68:49 gonna close this with an example that I
68:51 have mentioned two or three times in
68:52 different episodes I think it's a great
68:54 closer on this which is the game called
68:57 The Sims made by Will Wright Will Wright
69:01 was one of the pioneers of video games
69:03 in the 80s on computers
69:05 he made SimCity genius but he made a
69:09 game called The Sims and The Sims had
69:12 this situation where at first your
69:15 banjee people inside of a little home
69:16 and like you rotate the camera and the
69:20 walls disappear you know so you can see
69:22 your character at all times and they had
69:25 this social gauge on the character and
69:28 the character you know if you had it
69:32 full social gauge you'd be green if you
69:35 didn't socialize with someone it would
69:37 go down to zero and then it would go up
69:40 in red I think that's the way it worked
69:42 it was rather confusing for me at the
69:44 beginning because there was a point when
69:48 I would tell my character you had to go
69:49 to the restroom
69:51 to go the restroom and they wouldn't do
69:53 it sometimes they would just pee their
69:56 pants standing in the room they wouldn't
69:58 do anything I said sometimes they get on
70:00 the ground and just cry the point of
70:04 this was Will Wright had figured out I
70:07 don't know if I talking to a
70:08 psychologist or whatever but he
70:10 dramatized it so abruptly in the game
70:12 but I don't think that I don't know I
70:15 think there's probably very few human
70:17 beings on earth that would know that it
70:18 would have such a debilitating effect
70:21 but if your character didn't talk to
70:23 someone else literally talk dance joke
70:26 whatever they would shut down completely
70:30 even to the extent of not going the
70:33 bathroom to the extent of wetting
70:35 themselves to the extent of just
70:37 collapsing on the ground and saying nope
70:40 you got to get me to someone else the
70:43 problem was you get him so messed up
70:44 they couldn't even make the phone call
70:46 to bring anyone over eventually they
70:50 expanded the game and you can move them
70:51 around the neighborhood but that's how
70:54 important it is
70:56 it really is that important so I want
71:01 you to take inventory of your happiness
71:03 if you are happy truly happy
71:06 don't worry buddy this crap this is not
71:07 some imperative I'm telling you what
71:09 makes you happy and you got to go do it
71:10 please don't interpret it like that but
71:14 if you feel like there's a hole get out
71:17 there and interact the phone's pretty
71:20 good it's probably your first stage of
71:23 real true interaction and then maybe
71:25 Skype and that kind of thing but I think
71:28 you need to get out there in public
71:29 somewhere go see your family members go
71:32 see your buddy
71:34 your bestie how many times if someone
71:37 invited you to an event and you said at
71:39 your house going oh my god
71:41 I really just feel like being at home
71:43 tonight but for whatever reason you went
71:45 anyway and by the time you got home
71:47 you're like that was awesome
71:49 that was exactly what I needed well
71:54 that's that's it man that's the Holy
71:56 Grail
71:56 you have sipped from the chalice from
71:59 the palace Danny Kaye I would say I
72:03 think you feel me if you haven't been to
72:07 deep thoughts radio.com
72:08 please go there's audio video a locked
72:10 Facebook group a patreon page a store
72:14 and that's all you need to know take
72:17 care of yourself and someone else and I
72:18 will see you in the next deep thoughts
72:20 over now
72:26 you
