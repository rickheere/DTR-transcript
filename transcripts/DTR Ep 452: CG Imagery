00:30 welcome back ladies and gentlemen now
00:35 it's November it's the middle of
00:37 November 20 19 it is 80 plus degrees out
00:43 here and it's really 80 degrees out here
00:48 my phone's telling me it's 86 it's
00:52 beautiful out here
00:53 myself an Excalibur got this cool wizard
00:58 shirt my dad got me here this is Ralph
01:02 Bakshi's wizards now when I went to
01:05 animation school in the Brockton art
01:10 museum when I was 12 or so this is piece
01:14 right here is Disney's piece after the
01:17 old man they'll wizard zap disaster
01:22 robot named forgot what it was something
01:25 rather better than but the old wizard
01:27 hits him and then he's like he now your
01:29 name's piece and that's what he was he
01:35 was like a beautiful creature after that
01:39 man if it was only that easy right I've
01:43 been all up about 15 minutes then I
01:48 thought man that stays beautiful
01:50 schedules all upside down I've been
01:52 writing to the wee hours of the night
01:54 and I saw this one I'm going to spend
01:59 most of my day doing today but I'm also
02:01 gonna do some 3d stuff today just a
02:03 little tiny little thing for a friend of
02:06 mine but I've been debating this episode
02:09 for quite a while which is to say we
02:12 have CG stuff out there right
02:13 computer-generated graphics CGI again
02:20 everybody in my world didn't know and in
02:23 the business says CGI CGI and but you'll
02:25 hear all these people say it online CG
02:30 that's it
02:32 usually it was a CG okay Peter generated
02:35 alright that's it that's how the
02:37 conversation goes in the end
02:38 Street so if you want to be hip and cool
02:40 drop the eye and what's funny is that we
02:43 used to have a internet scripts used to
02:47 be called CG ice so it got really
02:49 confusing in the 90s I have a book by Al
02:52 Riley that says CGI scripting or so that
02:55 much I can't even I can't remember what
02:58 the hell the acronym stands for but
03:00 anyway what this episode is going to
03:01 attempt to do is a couple things now
03:06 there are a lot of you out there that
03:07 really follow 3d software even though
03:09 you may not use it you follow the
03:11 industry we have geniuses like Tim who
03:14 have been in the industry well we have a
03:17 guy who's just a member who has he's
03:23 done as much as probably most of my
03:25 friends so we have some beautiful
03:28 experts and it's funny to watch people
03:29 you know argue with Tim it's like you're
03:35 wrong Tim is right but I've been around
03:38 this industry for a super long time but
03:41 in the computer business for a long time
03:43 game business for a long time
03:45 my co-host from the other show MKULTRA
03:49 radio like I say several times he's got
03:51 two Emmys for special effects one for
03:54 serenity the movie and one for
03:57 Battlestar Galactica the relaunch he's
04:00 now working on Top Gun but the dude is
04:02 done I think he's touched every Star
04:06 Trek from Voyager up he helped do the
04:11 intro for enterprise but the dude is
04:13 just like he's done all kinds of weird
04:17 stuff like Apple commercials and you
04:19 know it's just nuts but once you get you
04:22 know a friend in the business then you
04:24 invited to a party and then there are a
04:27 bunch of people you meet in the industry
04:30 right check that out those of you missed
04:35 it on the podcast that wasp just totally
04:38 checked out the camera there they will
04:40 do instant replay here we go instant
04:43 replay where did this you know this
04:46 industry come from because there's
04:47 always been special effects right
04:50 we know that you know the first time you
04:52 saw King Kong you saw someone point a
04:58 gun and there's a laser coming out and
04:59 the Buck Rogers episode back in the 30s
05:02 we've had people screwing around with
05:04 cameras and making special effects and
05:06 the funny thing is is that the animated
05:08 24 frames per second camera came out of
05:12 someone playing with 35 millimeter
05:14 cameras or whatever millimeter they used
05:17 to be and then speeding it up and
05:20 playing it really fast and seeing the
05:21 guy on the horse you know run and the
05:23 guy walking animating those I forgot
05:25 what they call it but this little
05:26 carousel devices back in the day so
05:31 there's always someone being clever with
05:32 imagery so way back in the day you got
05:35 people literally using grease pencil or
05:38 other techniques to draw literally on
05:41 the film frame by frame by frame and
05:43 then taking pictures of that and then
05:46 printing it such that they could
05:48 distribute the film anywhere right all
05:52 the way up to today we have massive AI
05:56 participating in the deep fake it
06:00 studies my face a thousand percent and
06:02 then says oh well let's just put Arnold
06:05 Schwarzenegger space over the stood
06:06 space and honestly it's really smart
06:11 okay but as a programmer theoretically
06:17 it's not that intense I mean it's really
06:20 not that intense okay we're going to
06:22 we're going to rasterize the human face
06:25 we're obviously looking for a couple
06:27 like sockets a nose a mouth and then
06:31 relative positioning thereof once we
06:33 find what we can approximate as a center
06:37 of an eye socket the edge of a mouth
06:38 then we have these orientation points
06:41 that we can start jumping off and start
06:42 looking for the chin lines the ears all
06:45 that good stuff now someone has to do it
06:49 and people who actually do it they get
06:52 the award because they went through the
06:55 theoretical process of making it happen
06:57 there's a lot of people that will poopoo
06:59 other people's stuff unless you do it
07:02 you're not the you're not the dude
07:04 the dudette right but it is
07:07 theoretically very explainable so I'm
07:10 gonna do is take you through the first
07:13 pixel all the way to modern-day and
07:17 start to kind of piece it together
07:20 because the other audience is the
07:22 audience that really doesn't know
07:23 anything about computer-generated
07:24 imagery but they pretend like they do
07:27 because they'd only be caught with their
07:28 pants down in public and so this video
07:31 is for you
07:32 and you'll know more than most people
07:34 after this video is over from the
07:37 software to the capabilities to the
07:38 history like it's done my little lizards
07:41 getting a lot bigger today's his day 86
07:46 degrees in November like hell yeah
07:49 looks like the wasps are really super
07:53 agitated right now like it like excited
07:55 not angry they're looking for new homes
07:58 moving around I think they thought their
08:02 game was over I'm starting to get a
08:04 super duper cold
08:06 that's your wasp update I believe I have
08:09 this date right this guy's name's Ivan
08:13 Sutherland 1962 it was either 62 some
08:21 reason 68 rings in my mind too but he
08:22 plots the very first pixel on a screen
08:26 using a memory it's black and white he's
08:31 got a range of memory that he set aside
08:34 that is either 0 or 1 and the zero men
08:39 don't do anything and the one meant
08:41 there's a pixel now part of the genius
08:44 of the pixel is that you have this sort
08:48 of quantifiable little square which for
08:50 all of us today is no big deal but the
08:54 truth of the matter is we have monitors
08:58 that are shooting this gun from the back
09:00 of this this tube covered in phosphor I
09:05 believe that's what it is and it's got
09:07 this piece of metal inside it's got this
09:11 checker or this sort of Swiss cheese
09:13 pattern they're all round and so it's
09:17 shooting and hitting that
09:18 and then hitting the screen and that's
09:19 what's creating this picture that you
09:21 see and it starts in the upper left and
09:23 goes xìng xìng xìng xìng xìng to the
09:25 lower right and the reason why when your
09:27 computer or so when your monitor got out
09:28 of phase your TV back in the day you
09:31 started that black line they kept kind
09:32 of rolling over the reason why that
09:36 existed was that your refresh rate was
09:39 out of sync with your eyeball and so the
09:42 black line that you see was the
09:45 broadcast dead signal between frames so
09:50 you know you have to have so many frames
09:51 per second to see TV and this is
09:54 changing constantly in the 60s and 70s
09:56 and you know they kept trying to figure
09:59 it out but there was a dead zone and so
10:04 the gun is just waiting but that would
10:07 carry those bits into the viewable range
10:09 if it was out of sync and so you're
10:13 always adjusting the TV and that's not
10:18 to be confused with degauss in your
10:20 monitor as well those dude plots a pixel
10:24 but he understands he's going to have to
10:27 do a little bit of geometry within the
10:30 TV to plot the thing in a way that it
10:33 can have any dimension of viewability
10:35 because a single point from that gun is
10:39 nearly invisible and it's got kind of
10:41 kind of a glowy roundness to it like a
10:43 star it doesn't really work that well
10:47 but once he did that he taught
10:50 programmers holy crap
10:52 we can now create sort of a pixelated
10:56 fiction on the screen and someone as
11:01 boring as it might seem someone had the
11:04 ingenious idea of creating the game pong
11:08 you've seen it right two little walls on
11:12 both sides got a little control first
11:16 pong was a stand-up video game was
11:18 actually pretty wild-looking they plot
11:21 like a little center line it's like a
11:24 little tennis net and they differed
11:27 quite a bit between units but you have
11:31 this thing and you have the ball
11:32 and it's just kinetic energy transfers
11:36 if I remember right the very first pong
11:38 game I don't know if it was an Atari
11:42 game or not but it is soon got into
11:43 Ataris hands and that launched their
11:46 empire and perhaps it wasn't copyrighted
11:49 then we have the golden era of arcade
11:53 games and I've got a whole episode on
11:55 arcades not only the games we like to
11:57 play but the culture and the moment that
12:01 no longer exists that when you try to
12:03 tell your kids about arcades you know
12:05 you just sort of give up so that episode
12:08 is dedicated to getting it right but you
12:11 know we get space invaders asteroids and
12:14 they're all fairly you know they're
12:16 using different technologies asteroids
12:18 used a special type of rendering engine
12:22 where the gun was actually told how to
12:23 paint every character on the screen
12:26 whereas space invaders was using the
12:31 pixel technology pixels their pixels not
12:34 there you know the games were black and
12:37 white but in order to make the the the
12:41 first games were black and white but in
12:42 order to make it sexy they put a film
12:44 over the TV to make sure that the black
12:48 of my pixels went through and got some
12:49 color you know that was one of the
12:52 initial techniques and then eventually
12:54 we started getting multiple bit
12:58 technology 4-bit 8-bit 16-bit and each
13:01 one of these bits allowed a color to get
13:04 assigned to a pixel it's simply about
13:08 moving numbers around people if I say it
13:11 pixels at an XY that's two digits I've
13:14 got a whole two integers I have to hold
13:16 depending on how much resolution you
13:18 have that energy could be you know the X
13:20 could be gigantic a five-k monitor be
13:23 huge and then you know you have the Y
13:26 and then you have to decide whether it's
13:28 on or off now if you want the pixel to
13:31 have a color then on a separate table
13:34 you got to say for that pixel I've got
13:36 this RGB value red green blue value that
13:40 you could blend together in an extreme
13:43 science you might have CMYK cyan yellow
13:48 magenta black so black would be the
13:52 brightness so we start to master
13:56 rendering things just straight-up
13:58 Cartesian coordinates XY on/off and then
14:01 what color is it okay so now we have a
14:04 platform to relay really artificial
14:08 things directly to the screen it could
14:13 be a photograph that was scanned in
14:14 could be just something that a
14:16 programmer drew and a piece of software
14:18 so now you have software you know
14:21 engineers that are like oh my god we got
14:23 to create some paint applications and
14:26 there's then different philosophies of
14:28 how to create paint applications you
14:30 have your Photoshop kind of guys that
14:31 believe that you could just draw in
14:34 pixels only when we used to draw video
14:39 games in the 80s Electronic Arts bought
14:41 a company I don't think they made this
14:44 from scratch but maybe I had that wrong
14:46 but it's called deluxe paint everybody
14:48 use that product man it was 600 by 400
14:51 the man the tool was fantastic then you
14:56 had applications like super paint which
14:58 were just black and white for quite a
14:59 long time but then you have folks that
15:02 are thinking on the realm of of vector
15:09 graphics and you get your illustrator
15:11 folks so instead of deciding that it
15:12 pixels on or off personally
15:15 you're gonna draw using tools that are
15:18 algorithmic I want a circle that's got
15:20 this diameter and I want it right here
15:23 you figure out what pixels are on when
15:25 it finally renders because I want this
15:27 to be able to render on a teeny tiny
15:29 postage stamp high res and I wanted to
15:32 render on a 5k monitor and I want
15:36 everything to be as perfect and smooth
15:37 as possible so algorithmic drawing was
15:41 the advancement for pixelated drawing
15:43 and then there was a little mistake that
15:48 happened in terms of its intent versus
15:52 its outcome and this was in the mid 70s
15:56 we were heavy into wow that's loud
16:00 particular power plants when I have to
16:03 scarecrow this dude out of here but then
16:06 we start building nuclear power plants
16:08 and we have a problem on our hands they
16:12 are responsible for radiating their
16:14 employees and so they set up a ton of
16:18 sensors all over the core of the nuclear
16:25 power plant and they're sensing
16:26 obviously radiation it's like a bunch of
16:28 Geiger counter sensors well they were
16:31 also able to study the trajectory of a
16:35 particular particle with the device that
16:37 they were using so they had just like
16:39 the Hadron Collider
16:40 you know layers and layers of sensors
16:42 once you have layers and layers of
16:44 sensors to give you an XY coordinate
16:47 within the sensor just think about you
16:50 know a rectangle and on the first
16:52 rectangle you see it in the upper right
16:53 hand corner but the one right behind it
16:56 you see it drift a little bit towards
16:57 center on behind it goes right to her
16:59 center it went behind a goes down the
17:01 lower left-hand corner the that
17:04 information that's of no the strength of
17:08 the particle that's coming off the
17:09 nuclear power plant core but it's also
17:12 telling you the trajectory and what they
17:14 ended up doing was writing algorithms
17:16 the very first transformational
17:18 algorithms that says look this is
17:20 occurring in 3d space in the real world
17:24 but our superiors want to see it and
17:27 need to see it on the screen as a
17:30 picture but since we can't just take
17:33 pictures of electrons coming off a
17:35 nuclear core we're gonna have to write
17:38 software that will simulate this such
17:40 that people can see it so this goes on
17:44 for a couple years where they start to
17:47 perfect this this entire idea and it's
17:51 an interesting moment because that you
17:54 know that particular area of mathematics
17:56 you know rendering something that's in
17:59 3d and 2d such that you feel like you're
18:02 seeing it on the screen accurately just
18:06 organically came out of you know the
18:08 need to see things
18:09 on the screen to transmit it over a wire
18:12 you know
18:13 well once that little bag of tricks hid
18:18 the visual effects world the world would
18:21 never be the same again
18:23 and so just like the paint applications
18:26 there were all kinds of philosophies
18:27 about how to make an application that
18:31 could show you something in 3d so the
18:34 nuclear power plant stuff was just
18:35 really basic it was like you know little
18:37 green pixels they'd show you like a
18:39 picture of the core and they'd over
18:41 print on top of it where the pixels
18:43 actually were now for the first CG now
18:49 you have artists that are like or I
18:52 should say programmers that are saying
18:55 okay we've got to make some things
18:57 happen here there is no modeling
19:01 software there's no concept of modeling
19:03 software in the world which would be
19:05 take a pixel make another pixel some
19:08 other place in space-time right and they
19:11 connect them together to make an edge
19:13 you know and then take another one and
19:16 then put them together make a polygon
19:17 there's no concept for that initially so
19:21 these guys they get together and they
19:24 kind of all go off on their own religion
19:27 and they create their own software very
19:30 quickly they came to the conclusion that
19:32 the world is sort of made up of some
19:35 basic things and maybe we can just work
19:37 with some basic things to make
19:39 everything occur and that at a later
19:41 date we can create the software that
19:44 will allow us to personally formulate
19:47 what something looks like like you you
19:50 know this awning thing that's over my
19:52 head right that I've always put in the
19:53 intros for the most part it's all cubes
19:57 yeah some were squished somewhere along
19:59 bits a cube so you make a cube and you
20:02 tell it what shape you want it to be
20:03 well what's the nail the nail is sort of
20:06 a cylinder it's tapering it one in and
20:11 the head is usually just a cylinder has
20:14 been flattened out if it's a screw it's
20:16 a sphere that's been chopped so you see
20:19 in the top part of the sphere and so
20:22 they had created this math
20:23 that adds things to the geometry some of
20:28 the very first CG I've ever seen is like
20:30 centipede looking stuff or a bunch of
20:32 spheres we're all linked together and
20:33 the centipedes like on a little
20:35 algorithm swimming through space so
20:38 obviously everything is very primitive
20:39 at the beginning but this purely going
20:44 to add geometry methodology wasn't
20:48 enough right you can't just add
20:50 everything to everything and get what
20:52 you're looking for unless you have the
20:54 meticulous nature of today where they
20:56 can just draw the petal of a rose there
21:00 it is so we have to and the birds are
21:05 crazy so they had to create a new
21:08 technology which was subtracting shapes
21:10 from other shapes what we call today as
21:13 a boolean operation so now imagine you
21:18 wanted to create a hole in something you
21:23 want to create a washer all right it's a
21:26 flat disk with a little donut hole in
21:27 the middle so this would be essentially
21:29 a cylinder squish really flat and then
21:32 you want to take another cylinder
21:34 through the center of the flat one and
21:38 subtract a hole out of the Senate
21:41 because it's very difficult to tell 3d
21:43 software the next thing I'm about to
21:45 draw is going to remove geometry from
21:49 the center it's a tough interface to do
21:52 so we use these boolean subtractors but
21:55 you can boolean two things together you
21:57 can pull you the boolean the difference
21:59 or you can boolean the unit the the
22:02 union of the two objects basically say
22:03 what's going to be left is where these
22:05 things touch everything else is going to
22:07 be shaved off so by the movie Tron 1982
22:13 you have four big players here in the
22:16 United States of America and what
22:18 they've been doing up to that point is
22:20 rendering logos doing little little
22:22 animations for commercials and really
22:24 just kind of getting a game on the
22:26 problem is is they have to obviously
22:28 convince people to pay money for CG
22:32 stuff without having you know
22:34 necessarily the proven record that hey
22:36 if you
22:37 make a CG commercial instead of a
22:39 hand-animated commercial you're gonna
22:41 make a ton more money there's really no
22:43 rationale for that so stuff is expensive
22:46 these guys have PhDs in a lot of cases
22:49 and in order to make what they're making
22:51 they need a big computer for 1976 to
22:56 1982 Cray computers little mini
23:00 computers mainframes there's not a lot
23:03 of power out there plus even though
23:07 they're actually making tremendous
23:08 amounts of progress and I mean some of
23:10 these companies were so ahead of the
23:12 game is ridiculous you might have one
23:14 company that's able to create some sort
23:17 of tetrahedron shape shape in 3d space
23:20 and they had engineers that said ok
23:22 we're going to be doing something called
23:25 ray tracing and ray tracing is the
23:29 straight-up
23:30 simulation of lights so you have a
23:32 little light in the room a light bulb
23:34 inside and at some point there's this is
23:36 a little Genesis moment where photon
23:39 waves are being cast and so they
23:44 algorithmically figure out how many
23:46 photons we're going to allow out of a
23:47 particular light source and then make it
23:49 all configurable today but strength
23:52 intensity color everything and then it's
23:55 gonna have to shoot out randomly now you
24:00 can imagine trying to be God in a
24:02 computer from the 70s it doesn't work
24:05 it's too much detail these computers
24:08 will be rendering to till today you know
24:10 45 years later so in order to correct
24:14 that issue or to live within the
24:16 constraints that they had they started
24:18 creating all kinds of wild algorithms
24:22 that would clip off and abort
24:25 anything that was gonna I wasn't gonna
24:27 make it into the camera once the pixel
24:29 just went too far off into nowhere they
24:32 just clip it and say it's over flipping
24:34 is not really the word for it but you
24:35 abandon that pixel the other thing was
24:38 that what if you create this tetrahedron
24:41 this 20-sided thing but they know the
24:44 back side of the camera is never going
24:45 to see it so as soon as they realize
24:49 that the camera can't
24:50 see a certain level you know on the
24:54 horizon of this thing they just stop
24:56 rendering it getting all that processor
24:58 power back and giving it to everything
25:00 else that actually is going to be seen
25:02 of course it's a little bit different
25:04 today because we have monster power and
25:06 just an average laptop compared to their
25:09 world but they started creating every
25:12 single trick that could possibly create
25:13 plus they have different theories about
25:16 how to store things in memory initially
25:19 they're calling everything different
25:20 things because they have what we call
25:24 today the mesh the 3d mesh that's in
25:27 memory which is all the geometry that
25:29 creates something and then you're gonna
25:31 have to put some sort of surface on it
25:35 today we call it a shader in most cases
25:39 a shader is the straight-up color that's
25:42 going to be on something but now what if
25:44 I want to render this cigar and I wanted
25:47 to have fine tobacco wrapper on the
25:50 outside of this cylinder and I wanted to
25:52 have the veins from the leaves that I'm
25:54 smoking there's a lot of work involved
25:57 I've got to find a picture of tobacco in
26:01 most cases now you can also play with
26:03 shaders and shaders can create stars all
26:06 the stars in the intro are on a shader
26:08 there's nothing that's I'm not putting a
26:11 texture in the background it's actually
26:13 a shader creating stars now for the
26:16 planets that you see in the intro well
26:18 those are straight from NASA and those
26:21 are their CG pictures that they tell you
26:23 are real so you have textures textures
26:27 are straight-up pictures of things like
26:30 a brick wall piece of steel and
26:33 someone's taking a photograph of it you
26:35 know big square photograph and then they
26:38 treat it in a particular way or they cut
26:40 it in four pieces and then they move the
26:42 corners around and they soften it up
26:45 such that it can repeat as a pattern you
26:49 should do we used to do this in video
26:50 games forever but early CG had none of
26:54 this texturing stuff it just had shaders
26:58 now they're gonna they would have called
27:00 it something different in every single
27:02 studio back in those times
27:04 but one company's gonna acknowledge that
27:06 shadows happen another company's gonna
27:09 acknowledge shadows on an object but not
27:11 shadows that it casts on the ground and
27:14 so again I don't know which episodes
27:17 gonna come first I think I'll put the
27:19 Tron one out first but maybe I'll put
27:20 this one out first but the movie Tron
27:23 from 1982 it is a beautiful historical
27:29 record of all this technology coming
27:33 together 1982 in such a way that it told
27:37 the story perfectly to the point that
27:39 Tron is a cult classic franchise there
27:42 is more CG I think in every scene in
27:45 1982 than in the scenes and Tron Legacy
27:50 in terms of not the amount of humans
27:53 worked on things with just the fact that
27:56 they built a lot of the set pieces in
27:58 Tron Legacy trying to get away from CG
28:01 which is sort of been this trend right
28:03 was that the mandalorian show the Star
28:07 Wars show on Disney the actors are like
28:12 man I expected to be in the green screen
28:14 more expected to be a blue screen more
28:15 and they're showing up and these sets
28:17 completely exists which is cool that's
28:20 the way they did it back in the 70s so
28:23 then you know we've got these companies
28:26 and as far as I can remember I don't
28:31 know exactly which ones have survived
28:34 but you start to have the demand for
28:39 software and computers to do
28:42 computer-generated graphics right at CG
28:44 let's knock out the AI now you have two
28:50 super power houses that happen in the
28:52 Bay Area right away as soon as you get
28:54 into the Tron poster on 1983 Arab you
29:00 have the budding company that will
29:03 eventually turn out to be Pixar now
29:06 Pixar was founded by the guys that did
29:08 really wrote these transformational
29:10 algorithms when I first came to
29:13 California in 87 I was desperately
29:16 looking for the
29:17 because in my hometown I had mastered
29:20 everything that was 2d actually went up
29:23 to my computer teacher who was my
29:25 physics teacher my trig teacher
29:27 programming teacher everything astronomy
29:31 soundwaves
29:32 all that stuff and I asked him I said
29:35 how the hell do you trance translate
29:37 something in 3d to 2d cuz I want to
29:40 start making video games like that and
29:42 he didn't know he had no idea he had no
29:44 idea like where to go at all right we
29:48 had no internet so I'm at home trying to
29:50 invent these transformation lockers I'm
29:52 literally just like Newton at home like
29:54 okay let's run this algorithm and see if
29:57 we can get this to him they can in my
29:58 head how to rasterize but I got here and
30:01 about two years later my boss my new
30:06 boss it was sort of after the video game
30:09 my little stint and video game drawing
30:12 before I got in full-time he knew how to
30:16 do it and he gave me this big-ass book I
30:19 can't remember the name of it but it was
30:20 written by several folks but most of
30:23 them work for Pixar these guys have PhDs
30:27 in this stuff man and it's just
30:28 unbelievable and this is you know Pixar
30:30 invented a tremendous amount of the
30:34 algorithms that we end up using today
30:36 and this is you know they had the little
30:38 unicycle was one of their first movies
30:39 they ever made the unicycle that was in
30:41 the back of the store and they made this
30:43 freaking movie about it being a living
30:46 thing
30:46 they created the the little beach ball
30:49 with the star and the stripe on it and
30:51 that was very specific to test texturing
30:55 plus shading plus materials like the
30:59 ball was made of like a beach ball
31:00 material a blown-up piece of plastic and
31:04 then of course you know their logo you
31:07 know the little dancing light there's a
31:09 bunch of stuff going on not only the
31:12 geometry of the light which was handmade
31:14 but it's the light source that's coming
31:16 from the inside it is trying to create
31:19 you know the kind of the bounce and
31:22 squish algorithms of normal animation
31:24 making it cute synchronizing it with
31:27 sound George Lucas is funding them
31:31 Botham couldn't quite you know after the
31:36 Star Wars movies were over this place is
31:38 sucking him dry and he has no more you
31:41 know
31:41 like brand-new movie income coming in so
31:44 someone told him you know you should
31:46 probably sell that and Steve Jobs comes
31:49 around and goes I'll take it
31:51 kaboom and I'm you know I I know very
31:56 little about how Steve managed Pixar at
31:58 all very very little but eventually we
32:01 got Toy Story now Pixar has to go first
32:06 right so Pixar is having to write all
32:10 their own software their software
32:13 it's called render man and it was just
32:17 SuperDuper gorgeous software for the
32:21 time they made sure they could conquer
32:24 everything that was on their plate at
32:27 the time now for those of you are really
32:30 CG addicts you know you watch special
32:33 effects all the time or you're in the
32:34 business of course there's plenty of
32:36 dragons they hadn't slayed yet you know
32:38 when they created the Nemo movie I was
32:42 working with Bobby back on his animation
32:44 school website which is a hilarious
32:47 bizarre story which is animation mentor
32:51 I think that's what it was called
32:52 I still exist so I got a lot of you know
32:55 inside information about what they were
32:58 going through and it was the refraction
33:00 of light in water and he was telling me
33:04 at the time that they were rendering
33:07 Finding Nemo that it took 27 hours for
33:11 some of the frames with super computers
33:13 at the time so what computers were they
33:16 using aha this is we have another
33:19 company that blows up just a few years
33:22 after Pixar in the mid 80s called
33:28 Silicon Graphics Silicon Graphics is one
33:32 of these companies that it's no longer
33:34 well actually sorry I think someone
33:36 bought the name right now but Silicon
33:38 Graphics went from mega huge
33:43 to almost non-existent what definitely
33:46 went out of business at one point a lot
33:48 of the big companies out there that are
33:51 sort of serving this business and the
33:52 hardware realm our former Silicon
33:55 Graphics employees the Silicon Graphics
33:58 who realized ok there's there's this
34:02 huge need to drive this 3d software that
34:07 all this custom stuff everyone's making
34:09 plus those PDI which we'll talk about in
34:12 a second here so they started making
34:14 these computers these monster computers
34:17 and they were also they also had a
34:19 software division which I believe made
34:23 flight simulators at one point but they
34:27 they were the ones that realized that
34:31 you know we're gonna put tons of
34:33 processors in here we're gonna have
34:34 external you know LED indicators as to
34:38 how many processors are in a particular
34:39 computer you know like the first one I
34:41 ever saw was a predator which had been
34:44 jacked up to like 16 processors which at
34:46 the time computers had one processor it
34:50 wasn't until the early 90s that Apple
34:52 came out with its first dual processor
34:55 for a home computer but Silicon Graphics
34:59 was this cool ass company right in the
35:02 Bay Area between San Jose and San Mateo
35:06 and they had this bus that would drive
35:12 around and by the time I joined
35:15 Electronic Arts part time in 93 this bus
35:19 would show up in the parking lot and it
35:21 would like unfold right and it had this
35:23 maybe was a semi I guess like a big rig
35:26 I don't know I can't remember if that
35:29 was a bus or a big rig did you think it
35:31 was a bus but anyway it was super cool
35:32 and it was like you know they had stacks
35:35 of computers and you could come up and
35:36 look at him and they had computers that
35:40 were I think geared towards more
35:43 workstation computers like he'd put it
35:45 somewhere and you were modeling and and
35:47 it's modeling and when you rotate a 3d
35:50 model in real time it's a lot of
35:54 processing power to nail it in
35:56 full visual acuity even to this day 2019
36:00 you have to buy six thousand dollar
36:02 video cards to really get a fully
36:05 textured beautiful world to rotate
36:08 without any any kind of rendering time
36:12 taking place now this this intro I made
36:15 for the UFO in the background it's just
36:20 running on my Macintosh or my Windows
36:22 machine depending on where I was at the
36:24 time creating this stuff but you know
36:27 one frame of this 4k intro it was the
36:31 one landing in the backyard it's a
36:32 little faster because I'm using a plate
36:35 I shot at the backyard so it's not
36:36 rendering that but just this UFO coming
36:38 in spinning oh I could get a frame
36:40 probably when it's little it's about a
36:42 frame every thirty seconds or so but
36:47 when it starts getting big and getting
36:48 all the environmental textures on it and
36:50 they're animating from a movie that I
36:52 shot of the surrounding area oh man
36:56 it'll take good you know five to ten
36:59 minutes for a single frame now what I
37:02 was rendering the just to give you some
37:05 ideas when you see the UFOs done going
37:09 through the planets and then it goes
37:13 over the surface of the earth and you
37:15 see the moon close-up that's a whole
37:17 Flat Earth model I made with a bubble
37:19 dome over it with a dome underneath
37:21 super complex and I'm going to do
37:26 another shot of that eventually because
37:28 I did a tremendous amount of work on it
37:29 to make sure it's perfect in the camera
37:31 but that takes a really long time that
37:33 takes so much time that I actually
37:35 started rendering things in layers I
37:36 just rendered the backplate and I
37:38 rendered just the UFO by itself and
37:41 composited them together to save myself
37:43 a tremendous amount of time so you can
37:47 imagine in the 80s when we don't have
37:49 processors that are gigahertz they're
37:52 all working together to break this stuff
37:54 down and then you have to have software
37:56 that can talk to the computer so someone
37:59 has render man someone has something
38:01 else and you have to have it talk to it
38:03 okay well here's my here's the way I
38:05 want the you know is this is how I'm
38:07 processing the the image so I'm going to
38:09 give
38:09 - you little squares and you keep
38:11 rendering the squares now I'm gonna give
38:12 it to you and pixel by pixel right
38:15 the only other big CG movie that I'm
38:18 aware of between 1982 and 1992 which was
38:21 Terminator 2 in 1992 is The Last
38:25 Starfighter and there was you know some
38:29 little indie experiments here and there
38:32 but overall in terms of serious
38:36 cinematic CG The Last Starfighter took
38:41 it to another level
38:42 however they were never able to do the
38:45 compositing between live-action and CG
38:49 so you either at a CG scene or you had a
38:51 live-action scene I don't believe they
38:53 mix them together by 1992 we've all seen
38:57 t2 ILM blows this thing away
39:01 ILM is using Silicon Graphics computers
39:06 Electronic Arts has a few Pixar
39:09 definitely has a few and so everyone's
39:11 trying to say okay we're gonna stop
39:13 doing everything that we can do that we
39:16 can buy off-the-shelf
39:17 and we're only gonna participate in the
39:20 things that we would that we have to do
39:21 with our genetics right yeah this is
39:24 like amazing to be out on my t-shirt and
39:26 November I was so hoping this would be
39:28 one of those years now there was this
39:30 little computer back in the day called
39:32 the Amiga and it was one of these weird
39:38 situations where you have a group of
39:39 individuals who are so forward-thinking
39:45 that it's almost like they're they're
39:48 spying themselves they're so good one of
39:52 the very first pieces of software
39:53 written in the world to do 3d is called
39:56 sculpt 3d and it was in the early 80s on
39:59 the Amiga computer I had a really short
40:03 stent in my life on the Amiga computer
40:06 in the late 80s because a friend of mine
40:08 had one they didn't really know what to
40:10 do with it so they kind of had some
40:11 video games on it but that was about it
40:13 dad was a electronics engineer I don't
40:17 know if he used it he used to just sit
40:18 in his you know sort of lazy boy chair
40:22 watching
40:23 TV just drawing circuits by hand so he
40:25 just kind of knew it enough at his head
40:27 but there's a company today that creates
40:30 a product called light wave and they're
40:33 centered in Texas the company's new tech
40:35 that's any WT ek they had created a
40:39 product called Video Toaster and I
40:42 believe its initial incarnation was on
40:44 the amiga computer now the amiga
40:46 computer was the first computer to be
40:48 able to do 256 colors in a world where
40:51 everyone was stuck in 16 colors you know
40:56 vga cards were just starting to come out
40:59 on the windows box so that everyone
41:03 could have it but these two have CGA and
41:07 EGA which is like four colors man it was
41:09 hot and two of them are black-and-white
41:10 so take your pick for the other two
41:12 colors the Video Toaster
41:16 was so brilliantly designed that even
41:20 though an Amiga computer wasn't
41:22 tremendously fast compared to like some
41:24 some like Cray computer or Sun
41:27 Microsystems or some other custom thing
41:30 you were still able to link a bunch of
41:33 them together in the room for pennies on
41:35 the dollar and render full-blown quality
41:40 images I mean it was just really at the
41:42 limitation of your patience to wait for
41:44 an image to render plus your ability to
41:47 model and texture something or shade
41:50 something right I believe that the first
41:52 Babylon 5 series and the very first I'm
41:57 very very positive the very first Star
42:00 Trek CG that ever happened for next
42:01 generation we're done on these amiga
42:05 computers in a room because the buddy of
42:07 mine got into the team that was doing
42:09 Babylon 5 Kyle and he couldn't believe
42:14 it you know they'd go into a room and
42:16 there's just all these amigas and you're
42:17 like oh my god I mean I've been him but
42:19 what my buddies has seen that and
42:22 they're here they are rendering network
42:26 broadcast television CG with a bunch of
42:29 at the time considered to be pretty
42:32 dried up old computers they weren't
42:34 really being manufactured anymore
42:36 so new tech is this big player now since
42:41 then you know Maya in 2019 is sort of
42:45 the go-to product for all sort of
42:47 commercial CG if you don't work for a
42:51 company that makes their own software
42:53 like Pixar I will say that Pixar the CTO
42:58 of Pixar recently said in a public
43:01 gathering that the new blender 3d 2.8
43:06 does everything that their software does
43:08 for those of you that don't know blender
43:11 3d is free and has a massive community
43:14 just go blender.org just like the word
43:17 spelled other than special
43:18 get yourself 2.8 you can go and get the
43:21 beta every single day 2.8 I think
43:24 they're up 2.8 to now without even
43:26 releasing 2.81 but it's a great company
43:30 but now on the backside again you have
43:33 dozens and dozens of products that do 3d
43:36 at this point by nineteen say 90 but the
43:39 popular ones that are starting to come
43:41 through our 3d studio max which is its
43:44 own company at the time maya which is
43:47 owned by autodesk today most these
43:49 companies all started off independent
43:51 the company that made photoshop was
43:52 independent purchased by adobe the
43:54 company that made illustrator purchase
43:56 made it Obie all that's like PowerPoint
43:58 all these companies are separate then
44:02 they get kind of swallowed up today new
44:06 tech is still going strong with their
44:09 product light wave light wave is known
44:12 for very quick production pipelines is
44:19 difficult that is as it is to use it's
44:21 way easier than Maya and it's SuperDuper
44:24 fast so I think that blender you know
44:28 just as a little prediction here is
44:30 going to clean up the entire industry
44:32 because the price that they're putting
44:34 on this software is just outrageous they
44:37 still hang on to these ridiculous models
44:40 of oh we'll just charge four to ten
44:42 thousand dollars for a product will sell
44:43 a few copies and that'll keep the doors
44:45 on instead of you know selling it for
44:48 $1.99
44:49 and having tens of millions of people
44:51 legally owned the products right but who
44:55 are the big players by let's say 1993
44:57 you have Industrial Light and Magic
44:59 which took a long time to sort of get on
45:02 the 3d bandwagon but of course we have
45:05 to thank George Lucas because he's the
45:07 reason why Pixar got to where it's going
45:09 I mean you know give it to Steve Jobs -
45:12 Steve Jobs really made it a business but
45:15 he had the foresight to finance these
45:17 guys when they were actually coming up
45:19 with the algorithms now someone else
45:20 would have done it yeah PDI now PDI is a
45:23 weird little company that has been
45:25 swallowed up by a believe Sony the PDI
45:29 made Shrek when you see the first Mike I
45:32 think I can safely say my one of my
45:35 employees my master scheduler she went
45:39 off from ei and joined PDI and helped
45:42 finish up Shrek one and then did Shrek
45:45 two and shark three and I've been in PDI
45:47 a few times because I had other friends
45:48 at PDI and they were in I think it's
45:54 Palo Alto technically speaking but they
45:58 have their own software their own thing
46:00 so when you see the trek movies the
46:02 first three shark movies when you're
46:04 what you're looking at is completely
46:06 custom software now you know you're
46:08 seeing custom software when you see a
46:10 Pixar movie now today you're seeing one
46:13 of the store button products except for
46:15 Pixar which uses render man and render
46:17 man is actually I believe the rendering
46:21 engine so we're gonna get into the
46:22 stages of all this now because I I'm not
46:25 exactly sure what they call their actual
46:27 modeling software now again some of you
46:30 have dabbled in 3d you're hearing me and
46:32 you're like through this is boring some
46:35 of you have never done it before and you
46:36 really have no clue especially if you're
46:38 older why does CG like how does it work
46:41 man
46:42 so hopefully this is really helpful if
46:44 you have a hole in knowledge you will no
46:47 longer have that hole so let's talk
46:50 about let's take a break from the
46:51 companies in the history for a second
46:53 because now we're getting into
46:55 distinctions that I haven't explained
46:58 yet like why with one company be better
47:00 than another why is new tech faster than
47:02 Maya
47:02 so you have to come up with your design
47:06 someone's written a story a director has
47:09 agreed to make the movie make the
47:11 television show in some cases you have a
47:13 Star Trek where you have an enterprise
47:15 that's been around since the 60s
47:17 someone's redesigned it in 79 you're
47:19 going to redesign it for a next
47:21 generation so next generation for
47:23 instance was all models for several
47:25 years I think till like 93 before they
47:27 had a first CG ship and then it was only
47:31 CG at a few shots it wasn't CG for
47:33 everything when they blew up the
47:35 enterprise they did not use CG they used
47:38 a model and they physically blew it up
47:40 in a studio when the Voyager I think in
47:45 the intro even crashes into the snow
47:47 it's like the toilet lid looking thing
47:50 hits the snow and all that snow barfs up
47:52 in the camera that is a scene that my
47:54 buddy Kyle worked on and they had to go
47:56 off and buy I think every single box of
47:59 baking soda in town to create this set
48:03 so if you crash in the camera so there's
48:06 still plenty of room for physical assets
48:10 at this point but someone is going to
48:12 design the object that you're going to
48:13 have to model very rarely are you going
48:16 to sit there in 3d software because it's
48:18 so slow and you know design in 3d if you
48:24 do that and you're good at that that's
48:25 incredible now as a modeler because
48:30 people are people can say they're in
48:31 special effects and never do modeling
48:34 they can do special effects and never
48:36 touch a camera inside the 3d software
48:39 they could be in special effects and
48:42 they don't do either they help create
48:44 the computers that Network everything
48:46 together such that the other artists can
48:49 get it done there are other folks that
48:51 create nothing but plug-ins super
48:55 geniuses that say oh you're James
48:58 Cameron and you want a a water creature
49:01 to come up out of the water and have a
49:02 human face for a split second which was
49:04 then used in Terminator 2 for the CG cop
49:08 that goes you know into the the
49:11 helicopter and then turns into Chrome or
49:13 use Chrome first he turns into the human
49:16 these are remarkable shots these people
49:19 have created to trick the eye so plug-in
49:24 coders they exist at video game
49:27 companies like Blizzard has a I met them
49:30 like three sort of plug-in coders that
49:32 are creating algorithms such that inside
49:36 the engine you can get spells to go when
49:38 you see a guy cast a spell to teleport
49:40 you know you've got these wild you know
49:42 youth all kind of winds around their
49:44 hands
49:45 those are plug-in coders making a
49:48 reusable tool again you put the inputs
49:50 in you get the visual out it's really
49:53 cool so you can get into the special
49:56 effects business and not be an artist at
49:58 all but you'll be an artist by the time
50:00 it's over because you will help realize
50:02 a pixel on the screen right so modeling
50:09 you have really two disciplines to
50:12 creating a 3d model you can use all the
50:15 primitive shapes that we have discussed
50:16 the cone the cylinder sphere there's a
50:20 couple different types of spheres cubes
50:23 cubes they're always rectangles you know
50:25 you just keep scaling them and
50:27 stretching them and pulling them out and
50:29 then you have your real sculptors where
50:34 there's two types of sculptors in my
50:35 opinion there's true sculpting software
50:37 now where you can actually have a lump
50:39 of clay you can take a sphere and say
50:41 okay I'm going into sculpting mode and
50:44 you start using the sculpting tools
50:45 blender 2.8 sculpting tools are
50:49 beautiful and you just start hitting
50:51 this thing and it's starting to create
50:53 the geometry doesn't exist initially to
50:57 take a total corner on a cube and
51:00 smoothes it out like a my clay then you
51:05 can pull it and twist it and turn it and
51:07 pull big piece out and the only big
51:10 difference between that and reality is
51:12 that in reality you could never put the
51:14 you're gonna put marble back on after
51:17 you take it off and this you can you can
51:21 add clay it's really cool but now let's
51:25 say you have the shape that you're
51:27 looking for now you have a couple
51:28 different types of things you have
51:30 non-organic and organic it's a whole
51:32 different world right let's say you want
51:34 to create a like a little toy soldier
51:36 and you know he's a GI Joe from the 70s
51:39 so he has actuated arms hands wrists all
51:42 that kind of stuff but you know he can't
51:44 move like a human being completely right
51:47 so he has constraints and so you have
51:50 this methodology that we call rigging
51:52 today you put the bones inside of it and
51:55 then you rig it and what that means is
51:57 you're telling the 3d software depending
52:00 on its sophistication this was not was
52:03 not easy back in the day but let's just
52:05 say you had a you know two things that
52:07 were hinged like an elbow right you take
52:10 these two objects you tell them where
52:11 their rotation point is which just
52:14 coincidentally is where it looks like
52:16 there's actually a some sort of
52:19 connection between the two objects it's
52:21 all theoretical inside the software and
52:24 you say look you have to you you two are
52:27 always going to be attached at this one
52:28 point so if this thing moves this other
52:30 thing moves with it and you can actually
52:33 physics on it such that kind of ragdolls
52:35 as well but you will give it a
52:38 constraint you can only move in this
52:39 particular relative axis and you get an
52:44 elbow you get an arm right if I move my
52:46 arm right now on camera moving my arm
52:48 and my upper forearm has to obey my arm
52:52 you can do that in software by
52:55 developing these little constraints but
52:58 that's not organic right it'll work but
53:02 it won't look you know like like the
53:05 water creature in abyss which has got a
53:08 really nice organic flow it's it's
53:10 materializing and moving in a really
53:12 beautiful way right so let's say you
53:14 want to make a human being you're going
53:16 to have to give it bones now bones that
53:19 we have are obviously very important
53:23 because it keeps us having fingers and
53:25 chests and skulls and feet inside CG
53:32 well you know the skin on your chest in
53:36 a CG product right now it just is it
53:40 doesn't move that much it just is now
53:42 they're getting software to be
53:44 sophisticated enough that they actually
53:45 are making tissue rely on all the
53:48 internal structure they've been doing
53:49 this for years probably 20 years but in
53:52 most cases you could make a tiger and
53:55 then you start laying in core bones that
53:58 need to occur upper arms forearms you
54:00 know you're kind of mimicking the bones
54:02 inside but you don't necessarily have to
54:03 make the ribcage unless the ribcage
54:06 needs to flex and move with its
54:08 breathing you know if it's jumping
54:10 across a cavern in the and the Beast
54:13 stretches out his body to fly and then
54:15 soon as it hits it kind of compresses
54:17 all of its bones well if anything needs
54:20 to move then it needs to have a bone and
54:21 all the bones are associated with each
54:24 other based on all these rotational
54:26 disciplines it gets really complicated
54:31 I worked when I was doing the LED 3d
54:34 theater project and my last startup
54:37 again we had Rhythm & Hues bring us a
54:43 tiger an albino tiger and I met the I
54:47 met three of the engineers that actually
54:49 helped make this thing and one they were
54:52 blown away when they saw in 3d that was
54:54 so fun but they go look 33 people worked
54:57 about I don't know I think he sent like
55:00 20 years to make this thing so it had
55:02 been like a model that had been advanced
55:04 up through software it over and over and
55:06 over again and ended up being the basis
55:09 for the tiger in Life of Pi which I
55:13 still haven't seen that movie but to
55:15 give you a little bit of a preview about
55:17 how complex this has become they now
55:20 have algorithms that generate hair so
55:24 you take a surface and you say you have
55:25 hair on you blender has a great hair
55:27 generator but when they just put a bunch
55:30 of hair on a being which for Pixar was I
55:33 think the the creature in Monsters Inc
55:38 the John Goodman played the blue guy you
55:41 know it looks good but it looks kind of
55:44 like a toy you would get from a carnival
55:46 right it's just kind of furry that's it
55:49 well on a beast this dude was telling me
55:53 he was look you know he goes right here
55:54 he's pointing at it in 3d right nice
55:56 going
55:57 goes underneath the tiger it starts to
56:01 sweat down below and when water moisture
56:04 gets on a fibre of hair it changes its
56:08 entire behavior so we had to figure out
56:11 how sweaty the being was at any point in
56:14 time to wait these hairs down to map
56:16 them down a little bit and you know what
56:18 it's like when your hair gets wet it
56:19 clumps together and then when it's dry
56:21 it frays out and then when it settles
56:23 down over a day's worth of use like my
56:24 hair right now it's more smooth so these
56:29 artists are constantly picking this
56:32 stuff apart they look at reality every
56:34 single day they're not missing anything
56:37 they're knowing they know exactly where
56:39 light goes and so when they get to their
56:42 job their fiction is indistinguishable
56:46 with reality but now let's talk about
56:50 let's go back to the companies from one
56:52 little finishing phrase here so I'd get
56:56 out another stick here for my smoky and
56:58 cigar sampler these companies have
57:01 written all their own software at one
57:04 point in the early 90s right Pixar has
57:07 its modeling software which I don't
57:09 believe they shared that with anyone and
57:11 then they had what's called the
57:12 rendering software which takes the
57:14 geometry frame by frame and turns it
57:18 into finished frames making an
57:20 absolutely gorgeous and this is where
57:21 you know the artist is looking at sort
57:23 of a low res low polygon estimation of
57:27 what something looks like and then they
57:29 push a button and they send that low res
57:31 geometry off to the supercomputer array
57:33 the rendering farm and it used to take a
57:36 lot of time you guys used to go to lunch
57:38 or go get a cup of coffee and they could
57:42 finish it before the first frame comes
57:44 back and they look at it and they
57:45 inspect it you know just look real they
57:49 bring over the producer producers
57:52 looking at it you know assistant
57:53 director or whatever yeah okay that's
57:55 pretty good once you change that change
57:57 this
57:57 I noticed that - yeah okay and they go
58:00 back and fix things sometimes they'll
58:02 create an anomaly where the modeling
58:04 software got confused there's a big
58:09 thing about you
58:11 which side of the polygon is going to be
58:13 rendered in which side is not going to
58:14 be rendered and that's how they figure
58:17 out what's called clipping so sometimes
58:20 a polygon gets flipped backwards I want
58:22 to flip backwards it's invisible when it
58:23 flips the right way you can see it and
58:25 if they end up sending a beam of light
58:27 out and it hits the backside of a
58:28 polygon they just get rid of it
58:30 sometimes so the rendering side of
58:33 things starts to inadvertently create
58:37 standardization in the software and
58:39 cause problems for companies like PDI
58:44 now Pixar is doing the same thing PDI's
58:47 doing but Pixar is making multi-million
58:51 dollar movies now
58:52 so is PDI after Shrek came out right but
58:56 there is a situation where once you have
59:00 proprietary software created who created
59:03 it and that's where you get into a
59:06 staffing issue let's say you have a PhD
59:09 super mega-genius who's creating your
59:12 software and the guy gets sick and dies
59:14 or the guy gets disgruntled or the guy
59:17 just wants to move on in life nothing
59:19 bad going on he's just like I need to
59:21 get out of here now the company's like
59:23 oh crap we have to hire someone that can
59:26 understand his code wasn't get up to
59:28 speed on all of his code and then put
59:31 all the other features in for Shrek four
59:32 or five six seven eight nine ten and
59:34 then you have software that's written
59:37 really well in software that's extremely
59:40 cumbersome I was always told that PDI
59:44 software was very complicated let's just
59:49 say that and so you have modules that do
59:53 certain things well and certain modules
59:55 that do things badly and they're they
59:58 know how to fix it
59:58 they're just a matter of money and time
60:00 and quality that little triangle of
60:02 death and so as studios are looking at
60:09 okay we can hire you to make this movie
60:11 or we could hire someone else to make
60:13 this movie you know PDI owned I believe
60:16 the Shrek franchise I think that was
60:18 entirely their concept they put it
60:20 together and made a little
60:23 take for themselves but when you have
60:26 ILM Pixar and other big companies put
60:30 stuff together Digital Domain which I
60:35 believe James Cameron helped create
60:36 Digital Domain I have again fringe on
60:39 allerdyce who worked there as well then
60:41 you have Wetty now that creates all the
60:43 plan of the apes and all the Lord of the
60:45 Rings stuff it's not uncommon for one of
60:48 these guys to fly all over the world and
60:50 work in New Zealand for two years on an
60:54 avatar and then he flies to Scotland to
60:57 work on some CG game for Electronic Arts
61:01 and then fly back to the States to work
61:03 on car commercials or Apple commercials
61:06 right so it's it's it's a fun world but
61:09 it's a little brutal for these folks new
61:13 tech the the Lightwave product you know
61:17 anyone who uses it knows that it's
61:19 absolutely brilliant at what it does
61:21 they again will ship a product to you
61:24 and it has a certain core number
61:27 features out of the box right and maybe
61:30 an artist you know who's been in it
61:32 their whole life is like new text
61:34 modeling software is the best in the
61:36 world and they and they don't know
61:38 necessarily Maya but they're looking at
61:41 a guy in Maya going well how long does
61:42 it take you to make that spaceship oh
61:44 four months he's like I made it in four
61:46 days so I don't care what your product
61:49 does I don't need to learn it mine's
61:50 faster yeah well you know this is the
61:53 standard okay 3d studio max was
62:00 responsible for all of the breathtaking
62:03 CG that Blizzard Entertainment created I
62:05 mean where they were taking home awards
62:08 every year it was 3d studio max within
62:11 3d studio max gets purchased by Autodesk
62:13 who also owns Maya and there was a
62:15 religion philosophy of some new folks at
62:18 Blizzard or people that were worried
62:20 that 3d studio max wasn't going to keep
62:23 up with the with the trends and they
62:25 moved over to Maya
62:27 well that completely slowed down the
62:28 pipeline at Blizzard and they no longer
62:31 created these really beautiful super
62:33 long cinematics now they do today
62:36 the battle for Azeroth expansion to
62:39 World of Warcraft I finally got a
62:41 character to 120 I went back in just to
62:43 play it and there's a gigantic CG scene
62:46 in there that's it's all rendered in
62:48 Maya most likely but changing for the
62:51 sake of changing is sort of silly when
62:53 you really look at the fact that product
62:56 output generates revenue for the company
62:58 anyone getting in there and selling
63:01 upselling a religion that slows the
63:03 thing down by 40 times is just foolish
63:08 you know so but you still are gonna have
63:12 from 1990 to about 2010 okay for the
63:18 most part in you know there's a lot of
63:19 this still today everything is manually
63:22 generated human beings looking at models
63:25 they have some scanning scanning
63:26 techniques that they've used since the
63:28 early 90s where they would take a laser
63:29 and scan an object and that would
63:32 generally put some geometry in the
63:33 computer it's all horrible geometry
63:37 overcomplicated from the laser but then
63:39 human beings have to manually you know
63:43 draw on top of this other object to
63:46 reduce the amount of polygons because
63:49 the more polygons a model has the longer
63:53 it takes for it to render in the final
63:55 layer to make it look photo-real and so
63:59 there's all kinds there's still all
64:00 kinds of software that will take an
64:03 object that's you know drawing us some
64:04 massive level of detail but when it
64:07 shows up in the video game for instance
64:08 it's really tiny and so they run a bunch
64:11 of software on it to remove geometry to
64:16 make it smaller and they can do this
64:18 live that's what's cool they can have a
64:19 really super complicated one in memory
64:21 and one location but the one that you
64:23 see on the screen is like one tenth of
64:25 the geometry which makes it go a lot
64:27 quicker and it saves memory in the
64:29 computer because now think about it we
64:32 have all this geometry and rules bones
64:35 rigging / bones and memory and now you
64:41 want to animate the thing so every
64:43 single split-second every indices every
64:46 single point in space is being run
64:49 through this massive transformational
64:51 algorithm that is moving it in 3d space
64:55 and memory and then rendering it to you
64:58 in 2d plus it's like the light casting
65:01 and all this other stuff right so that's
65:04 when we get eventually the GPU the
65:09 graphics processing unit that's when you
65:12 get the companies like Silicon Graphics
65:13 looking at the math and going oh we're
65:16 always processing sort of this this
65:20 exact type of math and so let's build
65:22 processors that are absolutely geared
65:24 for nothing more than CG three three
65:28 coordinates in an 3d space and we're
65:30 going to crunch them and rotate them and
65:32 move them and so they can just throw
65:34 polygons at us and we're going to be a
65:36 polygon rendering machine and this
65:39 significantly improved video games for
65:42 consoles video games for your computer
65:44 if you had a GPU and your computer which
65:47 now every computer ships with one rate
65:48 it also mines Bitcoin really well but
65:52 now let's take a little pit stop here
65:56 because by 1993 we have created Tron
66:00 1982 Last Starfighter what's a little
66:05 films but we've also done Terminator 2
66:08 and terasi Park Jurassic Park is very
66:12 interesting because you can see the
66:14 evolution of the software and perhaps
66:16 even different companies that might have
66:17 participated although I think it's all
66:19 i--all em when you look at the
66:20 brontosaurus on the very first shot he
66:23 looks sort of weird his skin doesn't
66:25 look real it looks kind of glowy and
66:28 shiny it was almost like a test test run
66:32 they did internally to say we can do
66:34 this but then they never went back and
66:36 really made it look that real but by the
66:39 time you get the velociraptors in the
66:40 center of the phone we're towards in the
66:42 film running around the kitchen my god
66:45 you've got some you know Phil Tippett's
66:48 off creating the big you know feet in
66:50 the big skull with the eye that's moving
66:51 and stuff but still the velociraptors
66:54 look massively real and I'm overlooking
66:57 some stuff like masking you know when a
67:01 you know if you're trying to say look I
67:03 filmed this kitchen at live-action you
67:06 know it's a real kitchen and I have to
67:08 have a Velociraptor walk behind the
67:11 island in the center of this kitchen and
67:12 there's hanging spoons and stuff and we
67:15 have to make sure that the render of
67:19 this dinosaur doesn't over print on top
67:21 of a spoon that's in the foreground
67:22 right so they have to do masking exactly
67:27 where the spoon is and if the if the
67:29 dinosaur is bumping something because
67:32 it's kind of [ __ ] II in the kitchens
67:34 that's why it's indigenous world and
67:35 it's shaking all those spoons and
67:37 they're all going around well these
67:38 animators are in there they've rendered
67:40 the spoon but it's off-camera that'll
67:43 never be rendered in your eye what
67:45 they're doing is they're creating a mask
67:46 such that where the spoon is it's
67:48 subtracting the dinosaur
67:50 so the dinosaur does an over print on
67:52 something that's in the foreground I
67:53 mean this stuff is like so complicated
67:55 it's ridiculous right but what else
67:58 happened in 1993 which was sort of the
68:01 beginning of 3d video games you have
68:06 this little company in Texas called EADS
68:08 software and its software is famous for
68:11 its first sort of pseudo 3d games the
68:16 very first one they ever created was
68:17 Castle Wolfenstein which is doing some
68:21 again pseudo 3d but it convinced the AI
68:23 that it was in 3d now before that
68:27 artists just simply drew corridors and
68:29 as you would look around you know they
68:31 would just animate through some hand
68:34 animated door jambs rotating every once
68:37 in a while but it with John Carmack
68:41 being probably in history the most
68:45 brilliant 3d coder in the world you know
68:48 Unreal Engine is pretty amazing but
68:51 Carmack now creates I think what's
68:53 called the Tech 5 engine but Carmack's
68:57 is just he's a tour de force man he is
69:01 20 coders in one and he understands
69:04 absolutely everything about the hardware
69:06 of a computer as well as what the
69:08 software can do inside that hardware and
69:10 he is in my opinion the
69:13 first person to really push everything
69:17 to the next level now there's another
69:18 dude that was working with him back at
69:20 the beginning and there's this huge
69:22 ongoing drama lawsuit about the history
69:24 of the two of them but John is the one
69:26 that's continued to create software the
69:28 other guy didn't but then the other guy
69:29 claimed he did as much as John it's like
69:31 hey you know if I said I was you know a
69:36 marble sculptor as good as Michelangelo
69:38 and I helped create this you know the
69:41 Statue of David and all this other stuff
69:42 but then after I left you know
69:46 Michelangelo studio I'd never created
69:49 another one mmm kind of makes you go
69:53 well maybe you weren't what you thought
69:54 you were you know no disrespect right
69:57 but this game comes out and I think by
69:59 March 1983 called doom and John had
70:04 taken the Castle Wolfenstein code to the
70:06 next level where it wasn't perfect 3d
70:11 but it was good enough man you totally
70:14 run around this demonic room world or
70:19 whatever and it was an amazing game now
70:20 by the time he got to quake quake was
70:23 full 3d there's this other team they
70:26 created unreal which sold themselves to
70:28 GT interactive and unreal came out of a
70:31 came out right at the very beginning in
70:33 full 3d but now the reason why I take
70:37 this little digression over to video
70:39 games is to make a distinction between
70:41 the way that light was being portrayed
70:44 and calculated in memory from a video
70:47 game to 3d software because those of you
70:51 were alive at the time you know for a
70:54 fact that Doom isn't like Terminator 2
70:58 unreal is not like you know Jurassic
71:02 Park there's a huge difference in the
71:04 quality so what did they do did they
71:07 cast less light
71:09 no they invented a whole new technique
71:12 and this is brilliant and I it's amazing
71:16 it's called ray casting so you have a
71:20 camera just like your eyeballs and they
71:23 have something called the frustum
71:25 and it is the box by which the camera
71:29 can see all things so you know that from
71:32 your eyesight you've got your peripheral
71:33 vision but in a video game it pretty
71:35 much goes straight out because you have
71:36 a monitor you're looking at right we
71:38 have peripheral vision your video games
71:40 don't even if you buy a 50 monitor
71:42 straight you're just getting a wider
71:44 frustum you're not really getting light
71:46 that's coming in from your sides this is
71:48 what my LED 3d theater was designed to
71:53 do give you a peripheral vision and a
71:55 movie theater for the very first time
71:57 but were 10 20 years away from the
72:00 software hardware to do that so what
72:02 they did was they said okay we're gonna
72:05 start in the upper left hand corner and
72:08 we're gonna throw a pixel out and see
72:10 what it bumps into and we're only gonna
72:12 let it bump into things X number of
72:15 times and then we're gonna just tell the
72:16 camera this pixel is this color and they
72:20 go to the next one over and the next one
72:21 over the next one over so when you're
72:22 playing doom or even Castle Wolfenstein
72:25 every single frame is rendering every
72:28 pixel of Lulla every pixel of light on
72:30 the monitor for upper life upper left to
72:33 the lower right it's phenomenal that
72:36 they were able to do this on 386 is 46
72:39 is back in the early 90s I mean in real
72:42 time just mind-blowing how brilliant
72:46 these guys were meanwhile over in Pixar
72:48 by the Gees the was that Finding Nemo
72:53 must have been around 2002 they were
72:58 still taking 27 hours for one frame of
73:00 Finding Nemo so you have a divergence of
73:05 technology technique ray tracing which
73:09 is coming out of the actual light source
73:10 bouncing all over the room and if it
73:12 happens to make it into the camera you
73:13 get to see the light if you have a video
73:18 game you're ray casting and it's sending
73:20 in the opposite direction out from the
73:21 camera so just know that's the
73:23 difference between all of this software
73:25 and today because GPUs are so incredibly
73:29 powerful
73:30 you now have ray tracing in video games
73:33 and from my mind it's just mind-blowing
73:37 that the stuff is
73:38 come so quick that that's possible now
73:41 there's all kinds of other techniques we
73:43 use in video games to reduce the amount
73:47 of light calculations they have
73:51 something called baking and what they
73:53 will do is say well this lights never
73:57 going to move and so what we're gonna do
73:59 is we're going to in the studio before
74:02 you ever receive the videogame we're
74:05 going to take that that dungeon that
74:06 you're crawling through that forest that
74:08 you're crawling through and they have
74:09 that little lamp out there in the middle
74:10 of nowhere with a little light on it and
74:12 it's casting light onto the ground well
74:15 it's never gonna change no light you
74:18 know technically speaking if you walked
74:20 in front of the light you would disturb
74:21 the light on the ground but they know
74:22 you don't really care about that level
74:24 of massive detail so maybe they create a
74:27 shadow algorithm underneath you to blot
74:29 out what's down there but what they end
74:31 up doing is baking light in there and
74:33 this is all built into the engines at
74:35 this point but they try to bake as much
74:37 of the calculation as possible into the
74:41 artwork as textures instead of making
74:45 you do it live all the time but now a
74:47 guy named Will Wright who's an absolute
74:52 legend in video games he created way
74:54 back in the 80s SimCity and now you know
74:58 there's the Sims there's there was sim
75:01 earth for a little while I mean the guy
75:02 I think is um he created a company
75:06 called Maxis back in the I could
75:07 remember I had to look it up in May X is
75:10 out of I believe Walnut Creek and EA
75:15 acquired his company while I was working
75:17 at Electronic Arts which is why I know
75:19 most of this stuff
75:20 but after I had left in 2002 within the
75:25 next two or three years he created a
75:27 product called spores a video game
75:30 because he saw the writing on the wall
75:32 which is that the video games are
75:36 starting to get to be 1080p which was a
75:38 big deal another 4k well the challenge
75:42 for the video game companies and this is
75:43 now bleeding into the CG world of movies
75:47 is that what if you wanted to create New
75:49 York City in some apocalyptic world
75:52 where it's all dirty well the
75:55 old-fashioned way is you hire a bunch of
75:57 artists to create scraps of aluminum
76:00 cans and old mailboxes that have rusted
76:03 in a particular way windows that are
76:05 busted out in an infinite number of
76:07 combinations buildings you'd have to do
76:10 air every single building separately so
76:13 what will figured out was we're gonna
76:16 have to start writing code to randomize
76:20 models because we don't have enough
76:22 human beings to really tackle the the
76:26 organic nature of reality and so he bit
76:29 off this massive project and it was so
76:31 cute it's gone now I think it's pretty
76:34 much I have the collector's edition in
76:36 my closet because I knew it was a
76:38 landmark moment in time I didn't know if
76:40 this product was going to succeed but he
76:42 created a video game where you started
76:43 as a single cell creature and you ended
76:46 up creating multi-celled full-blown
76:51 aliens and you had a world that you were
76:54 on it was all kind of cute and textured
76:56 and you you chose what algorithms you
77:02 would use to put like a horn on the
77:04 front of the guy's thing where they had
77:05 teeth right here you know like in the
77:07 single cell or you know moebus stage you
77:09 know whether it had little zappers that
77:11 electricity on him but it was all
77:13 algorithmically generated models that
77:17 then you picked and put together it was
77:19 brilliant and then immediately all the
77:23 other game companies started realizing
77:26 this and started writing algorithms to
77:27 randomize everything and so you get this
77:30 randomization any of you played Diablo 3
77:32 know that World of Warcraft are sorry
77:35 Blizzard excuse me they randomized all
77:38 the dungeons now it's a bunch of hand
77:40 generated artwork but they've randomized
77:42 the paths and stuff so you'll never have
77:44 a dungeon the same necessarily so that
77:47 starts to solve this problem that they
77:50 have where they were running out of
77:51 resources or running out of money or
77:53 running out of time it's a big deal now
77:57 how many of you have ever seen things
77:59 like a spaceship explode in CG in the
78:03 90s and a spaceship explode in the
78:05 tens and then the spaceship exploding
78:07 the and the teens of the 21st century if
78:11 she paid attention you'll notice that
78:13 when things blow up in the 90s they
78:15 typically picked a few places where
78:18 these polygons would rip apart they
78:19 start breaking the ship apart but they
78:21 start putting fire like live-action fire
78:24 on top of the model such that by the
78:26 time your eye starts to discern this
78:28 explosion is very unrealistic there's a
78:31 fireball in front of it and you can't
78:33 really see it then by the first decade
78:36 of the 21st century now we're starting
78:38 to see some fairly decent you know
78:40 ripping of ships and when two ships
78:42 collide you know they're tearing each
78:44 other up starting to get a little bit
78:45 better and today it's awesome because
78:49 they've now written from the plug in
78:51 teams okay they will write software that
78:54 allows for a ripping of the existing
78:59 polygons as so as things start to blow
79:01 up they can say this is the center point
79:03 of the explosion or the collision or as
79:05 two polygons collide maybe just has
79:07 three points to create a triangle and
79:09 then all of a sudden it starts to
79:12 generate more sub polygons just for this
79:14 scene and starts to rip the thing apart
79:16 and it starts to look phenomenal now
79:19 we've got fire and smoke and everything
79:21 inside the computer water water is
79:24 phenomenal now even blender has like
79:26 photo real water remember a Pacific Rim
79:29 all those robots are CG and all the
79:31 water splashing around in the oceans is
79:34 all CG as well the other huge area which
79:38 we had to conquer or slowly over time
79:40 and I think we're getting damn near
79:43 perfect at this point which was the
79:45 human face the human face was rough even
79:48 to this day with what is it the CG
79:51 Princess Leia and rogue one at the very
79:55 end what we haven't really figured out
79:58 how to do is to move the mouth at the
80:00 proper speed of reality and I do not
80:03 know why this is so damn difficult
80:05 because it's in everything when you see
80:07 the CG Jeff Bridges in Legacy it's it's
80:12 bad I mean you know hats off to the
80:14 folks trying to make this occur I know
80:16 they have a really tight budget and a
80:17 tight
80:19 schedule they did the best they could
80:20 but I mean it's crazy it's creepy any
80:23 did any of you ever saw Polar Express
80:25 there's the scene on the the trolley car
80:30 and all these little kids are looking at
80:33 each other and boy they list look like a
80:34 little Damien omen you know devil
80:37 children because it doesn't look real
80:39 so rendering the eyeball perfectly was a
80:42 big deal just getting the color right
80:44 get any geometry correct getting the
80:47 skin on the face especially if it's
80:50 completely CG you'll understand why
80:53 Pixar went with a very cartoony looking
80:57 geometry because that they can get right
80:59 they can do Mickey Mouse just fine but
81:02 doing your sister your daughter your
81:04 wife very difficult and let's say they
81:07 get the face correct getting the hair to
81:10 flow properly is super duper difficult
81:12 there's a lot of physics in here and so
81:15 typically they will create a do that is
81:17 you know 95% locked it does move a
81:21 little bit and they have a few hairs
81:22 that'll move just a little bit as the
81:24 scene animates and a lot of times we're
81:27 gonna have to do it manually but now we
81:30 have something called the deep fake the
81:34 D fake is extremely impressive now I
81:38 have a whole episode called the deep
81:40 fake out which if you want to get into
81:41 the political implications and the
81:43 propaganda implications of the deep fake
81:45 go watch that episode we're not going to
81:47 get into those controversies in this
81:49 episode but now like I've said a few
81:51 times I was invited to a company in Los
81:54 Angeles about 2008 where a friend of a
82:01 friend in the industry of Harvard grad
82:04 brought me in and said look I got this
82:06 technology we're trying to get video
82:08 game companies to stop putting helmets
82:10 on all the characters to get rid of the
82:12 face problem and that they can't do it
82:14 realistically so why do it at all and
82:16 they showed me absolutely photo real
82:20 facial animations and it was I could rig
82:25 my face with all the dots and then they
82:30 could take any person in the
82:32 world and it would be that person and
82:36 again the demo was an Asian girl
82:38 probably in her early 20s doing the
82:41 animation but the character that was
82:43 animating an absolutely photo reel was
82:46 this black african tribesmen with face
82:48 paint on and all the crustiness of the
82:51 paint and the guy was probably I would
82:54 say he was least in his 40s
82:56 and it just looked phenomenal I mean it
83:00 was absolutely real and the funny thing
83:01 was I asked where the technology came
83:03 from and it came from an alphabet agency
83:07 it was it was Declassified to be used in
83:11 entertainment software it was over 10
83:14 years ago people with the deep fake
83:17 stuff were sitting on the Internet we're
83:18 starting to get to the stuff that I saw
83:20 11 years ago but you better believe that
83:24 stuff was completely implemented
83:29 probably 15 years before I saw it making
83:32 it 25 years ago so the deep fake is
83:39 obviously a marriage between so it can
83:43 take someone like Kris hater you know
83:45 who's on the late-night show he was
83:48 gonna do an impersonation of Arnold
83:50 Schwarzenegger and they can run his face
83:54 through software looking at every
83:56 inflection of his face which is
83:58 beautifully exposed in the in the shots
84:00 where his mouth is where his eye is if
84:02 he makes a particular you know
84:04 expression with his eyebrows and they
84:07 can take the geometry and overlap it
84:10 with Arnold Schwarzenegger face I've
84:15 saved some modern photograph of him and
84:17 it will look like hater turns into
84:20 Arnold Schwarzenegger and the funny
84:22 thing was when I first saw that that
84:27 deep fake of him doing the Arnall and
84:29 personation the funny thing is I didn't
84:31 realize I was looking at deep fake and
84:33 we're sitting in my smoke lounge and I
84:36 guess we just didn't read the video
84:38 title which had it right there in the
84:40 title and I'm looking at him and he
84:42 starts doing the Arnold impersonation
84:43 which obviously the voice is just
84:44 dead-on with
84:46 this guy and he looks just exactly like
84:49 you know Arnold Schwarzenegger and I was
84:51 like and everyone in the room is like oh
84:52 my god he really could transform his
84:54 face there look like Arnold
84:55 Schwarzenegger but the reality was they
84:57 were overlaying Arnold's real face on
84:59 top of hater for those of you who are
85:03 big fans of Fast and the Furious you
85:05 know that Paul Walker died in this
85:09 Porsche crash and then his brother ended
85:12 up being hired to play his body and I
85:16 believe the number is somewhere around a
85:19 hundred and seventy five scenes Plus
85:22 Paul Walker's in the movie but it's deep
85:26 faking his brothers face on top of his
85:28 body art you know if you think about
85:31 becoming from Paul to his brother his
85:35 brother had his his face put on him I
85:38 guess there's a better way to say it but
85:39 no one knew it except for people who
85:43 knew that he had died there because you
85:44 never know what book shots they might
85:46 have had before he died and you know I
85:48 got half of a Tim other half is not him
85:50 but I went and saw those shots and oh my
85:53 god it's crazy how realistic it is right
85:56 so what's the future of CG at this point
85:59 because that's the big question
86:02 well the writing's all over the wall D
86:05 fake is gonna continue to be a business
86:07 there is a movie that you need to see
86:10 called lookers made in 1979 to 1980
86:15 somewhere there my buddy Richard Taylor
86:16 did the special effects on it and it
86:19 predicted the future perfectly which was
86:23 that all things will become CG after a
86:26 while if we you know I will say this
86:31 much if we allow our world to turn into
86:35 some tyrannical [ __ ] show but then it
86:39 will be all CG and you won't know who's
86:41 real and who's fake in this world
86:43 imagine electing a president that
86:45 doesn't exist because the president is a
86:47 CG character and all you hear about are
86:52 rumors that the person exists but you
86:55 never get to see the person because
86:56 they're not allowed to go there you know
86:59 so CG is interesting it's it's it's a
87:02 beautiful thing for telling stories but
87:04 now it's starting to kind of get into
87:06 manipulating reality a little bit right
87:08 now here's what's funny I sit around and
87:12 watch shows all the time
87:14 with guys in their 40s and over and they
87:21 can't tell what CG and what's not CG and
87:25 a lot of it has to do with these fake
87:27 rocket launches from countries that
87:29 don't have rocket technology I know that
87:33 North Korea buys a bunch of stuff or did
87:36 before they got freed and emancipated
87:39 from alphabet agencies they were using
87:43 CG really bad techniques to launch
87:47 rockets inside CG software and then
87:49 telling the world and their citizens
87:50 look what we can do but every CG artist
87:53 is looking at it going oh my god it's
87:55 like a horrible smoke plug-in you know
87:57 you didn't even randomize it enough and
88:00 volumetrically it's wrong and lighting
88:02 it's wrong and sometimes you'll see them
88:07 try to blend live-action with CG and so
88:11 you'll have a rocket the cameras moved a
88:13 little bit it's shaken a little bit for
88:15 whatever reason someone didn't lock the
88:16 camera down bad tripod wind blew and so
88:20 the rocket is taking off in the launch
88:22 pad but it's kind of like left and right
88:23 left and right left and right because
88:25 the background is shaking but the
88:26 Rockets staying in place they didn't
88:28 track the shot properly when I land the
88:31 UFO in the background of this house I
88:33 stood pretty much where I'm standing now
88:35 I pointed the camera at the sky in fact
88:38 I did it backwards sorry I locked it
88:40 down I pointed straight at the backyard
88:41 so I had the final shot exactly the way
88:43 I wanted it because I didn't know
88:44 randomly how to bring it down perfectly
88:47 without doing too much adjustment right
88:49 so I pointed at the backyard and it's
88:53 filming in 4k and then I just push it up
88:55 to the sky which is that way then I got
88:59 into blender 3d they have a beautiful
89:02 tracking system inside but it took me at
89:05 least a week
89:06 and I'm not joking seven days to figure
89:09 out how to track this gigantic
89:12 pan because I've got objects up there
89:14 they don't exist in the bottom half down
89:16 here so I had to track track it in like
89:18 thirds like one third of the camera
89:19 tracked using objects that are up in
89:21 that shot and then one third the objects
89:23 there in the middle and the one third
89:24 all the patio things and they get it all
89:26 perfect so I learned a lot it was really
89:29 cool but I'd say YouTube is your best
89:31 friend for learning this stuff if you're
89:34 into if you want to get into this as a
89:35 profession or even just play around with
89:37 it for your own purposes get blender 3d
89:40 it's right now a two point eight two
89:43 point something is about the two point
89:46 eight something is about to release this
89:48 year I think it's a great organization
89:51 it's great people and they just have
89:54 everything they've got a full video
89:56 editing software like Final Cut in it if
89:59 you actually have a tiny little
90:00 Photoshop inside but they have 3d
90:03 sculpting down pat they have textures
90:06 and shaders down you can do pretty much
90:08 anything you can conceive it's all node
90:10 based programming when you want to get
90:12 into it meaning you don't have to write
90:14 any code if you don't want to they do
90:16 have Python interface as well if you're
90:17 a big plug-in kind of coder it's all
90:20 based on Python the reason why the
90:22 product exists is that the engineer who
90:24 wrote it it was in Europe you got tired
90:28 of writing everything by code so you
90:30 start creating interface components to
90:32 help them do some basic things and it
90:33 just kept growing and growing and I
90:35 think it's 25 years old now but now the
90:38 world is helping and the world is
90:40 donating to the movement so it is it is
90:42 just a beautiful piece of software and
90:44 growing in leaps and bounds if you get
90:47 into it today and you get serious with
90:49 the tutorials online you could be
90:52 employed probably with a deep six digit
90:57 salary in two to three years Spenny how
91:00 aggressive you are in terms of deep fake
91:03 inside a blender I'm not sure they've
91:05 quite conquered that that's a little bit
91:07 of other software since I have a little
91:10 bit of time on the stick I thought I
91:11 would talk about the tracking suits that
91:16 we use and how that technology is
91:18 changing you've all seen it if you've
91:20 seen the making of Planet of the Apes
91:22 the making of any of the lord of the
91:24 Ring
91:25 or The Hobbit shows Hobbit movies this
91:29 has been done for quite a while you'll
91:31 have human bodies and this is refined
91:33 itself considerably from this point but
91:35 there the old technique was to put a
91:37 bunch of little dots on a suit a leotard
91:39 and they're lit usually little plus
91:43 signs so they can kind of see how the
91:45 plus sign is turning inside the camera
91:47 and the software figures out ok well it
91:49 looks like this now then that body has
91:51 actually turned this way and look at all
91:53 the other dots to figure out how things
91:54 have worked but today that's been
91:56 optimized down to just a few dots in
91:59 fact geez two years ago my partner in
92:04 the 3d LED theater start-up Richard
92:08 Taylor had been shown technology where
92:12 you wear a little cell phone size thing
92:15 on you and you just have a few dots on
92:18 your fingers a few dots on your body and
92:20 it's all using wires to figure out how
92:23 you're using your body and you could
92:24 walk around in it for hours and hours
92:26 and hours and this little box down there
92:29 is memorizing how your body is moving
92:30 that doesn't do face you have to do your
92:32 face separately but that's a huge
92:35 improvement so a lot of the motion
92:37 capture stuff that you see out there is
92:38 phenomenal motion captors been around
92:40 forever video game companies have I
92:44 think for the most part started using
92:47 motion capture for everything some
92:49 companies like Blizzard held out for a
92:50 long time because the animators thought
92:52 that hand animated things had a special
92:55 feeling to it that that motion capture
92:59 didn't that kind of felt like they were
93:01 cheating it's like what Mortal Kombat
93:03 came out you had your Street Fighter
93:05 people that said a hand animate is the
93:07 way to go taking pictures of someone in
93:09 a studio and then animating them
93:11 together was cheating well Mortal Kombat
93:15 is now an absolute legendary product you
93:18 know so if I'm corrected at all by Tim
93:22 take his advice take his word for it
93:25 because he's right the history of
93:28 optical in camera effects optical
93:31 printers and all that stuff and the pre
93:33 CG world is another thing that is just
93:36 an odyssey unto itself
93:38 I know enough to be dangerous in that
93:41 world but I personally have never had my
93:43 hands on those machines
93:44 I think Tim has so you know it's it's
93:48 good to know the entire history of this
93:50 software and hardware so that you
93:53 understand where the vectors of
93:54 improvement are going you know like
93:56 what's what's left to fix what's left to
93:58 make better what are some of the old
94:00 techniques you know one of the
94:05 techniques that John Carmack used back
94:07 in the day was that in order to do some
94:11 of these transformational algorithms to
94:12 move pixels and vertices in 3d space so
94:18 that you could see him in 2d
94:19 we're very computationally heavy and
94:22 they were they use sine cosine
94:25 calculations quite a bit and tangent and
94:28 all kinds of other heavy calculations
94:31 that you know for those of you played
94:33 with calculators in the 80s you would
94:35 type in a number here cosine you watch
94:37 the calculator go BAM and it would give
94:40 you the ad you know think well computers
94:41 were no they weren't that much faster so
94:45 one of the things that John did was they
94:50 pre calculated in memory a bunch of
94:54 numbers they basically said we're always
94:56 taking this number and getting the
94:58 cosine of it so let's just do it ahead
95:00 of time put it in memory and then when
95:02 we need that instead of calculating it
95:04 we'll look it up in like a table like
95:06 those old math you know your old
95:07 multiplication table lookup sheets right
95:12 and so that was a technique to make
95:14 things a lot faster another one was that
95:17 floating point math having to track a
95:20 decimal place you know you got a number
95:22 a decimal and then way before the
95:24 decimal well that takes a significant
95:27 amount of memory takes a significant
95:30 amount of processing power but integer
95:32 integer math with no decimal decimal
95:34 place goes really quick and so there
95:38 were techniques developed to live inside
95:40 of integer math integer math and then at
95:45 the last second you put the decimal
95:46 place in or it's supposed to go and I'll
95:49 give you a real world example
95:52 of where I use this technique and this
95:55 is why it's important to know the whole
95:56 history of all things because it's a
95:59 back of tricks man okay
96:01 I was my buddy from Blizzard who was in
96:05 cinematics he came out and started his
96:09 own company and his company is called Lu
96:12 motive I believe it still exists but it
96:16 was creating LED hats where you would
96:18 have this really badass logo in the
96:19 front and it was it was essentially this
96:23 laser perforated gel that went
96:25 underneath the caps front piece of cloth
96:27 and so we could cut a hole in the cloth
96:28 and then we could change the color of
96:31 the gel using three LED lights on the
96:35 side it was only three might have been
96:37 four but he works for a year to figure
96:42 out the best technology that make that
96:44 affordable makes it reliable he actually
96:47 went off and initially tapped the
96:51 company that made the Tron suits and
96:53 found out that that technology was very
96:56 cumbersome it actually had a vibration
97:00 in the circuit and so you would hear
97:02 this kind of e you know and because it's
97:04 really close to your head so you're
97:05 hearing this so we're like hey that's
97:07 not gonna work so he found this other
97:09 technique this laser perforation but he
97:13 needed a program to be able to change
97:15 the colors and rotate through the colors
97:17 and he wanted to double click to make it
97:19 go into one mode you could program up
97:22 till like 23 colors and you could make
97:25 it strobe you can make it fade this is
97:27 what he wanted but he didn't have it yet
97:29 right so I see this product and I'm just
97:32 submitting the medial I'm like oh my god
97:33 this is the coolest thing Scott let me
97:36 get inside and write the code for this
97:38 microprocessor I've never done it before
97:41 in my life but I know I can do it let me
97:43 have it
97:44 and he put me off and put me off put me
97:46 off because he was getting the current
97:48 Hardware of the Hat figured out but once
97:51 he had that figured out he goes okay
97:53 smart guy
97:54 whatever figured this out and so he gave
97:58 me the pre-existing kernel code which
98:01 beautifully had the inputs and outputs
98:04 already figured out how to
98:06 talk to the LED was already figured out
98:07 for me how to sense you know the battery
98:10 supply being below a threshold where it
98:12 needs to recharge and all these
98:14 different little basic things were
98:15 programmed by the people who made the
98:17 chip now the chip is smaller than a
98:20 postage stamp I mean the thing is it's
98:23 probably I don't know it was 60% the
98:25 size of a normal postage stamp
98:26 tiny little thing right I think I had 2
98:31 Meg of RAM inside this thing
98:32 so the showing a color and strobing
98:38 things not too difficult just a bunch of
98:39 timers and that kind of stuff
98:41 I had to program the double click by
98:43 myself which was definitely the least
98:46 fun of the whole thing but I contact the
98:50 manufacturer of the chip and I said look
98:53 I got to do a bunch of RGB blending
98:57 color blending because I'm gonna take
98:59 two colors and overtime blend say red to
99:02 blue it's probably gonna be purple in
99:05 the center and then it's going to hit
99:06 the other side right well in order to
99:09 really do this properly it's got a ton
99:10 of floating point math in it well the
99:13 chip doesn't have enough memory to hold
99:16 my data in memory my program in memory
99:19 and then have all these massively
99:20 complex floating-point algorithms going
99:22 on so the chip manufacturer tells me you
99:25 can't do it you're gonna have to upgrade
99:27 your chip and so I went into their
99:30 forums and I talked about it again
99:31 everyone's like you can't do it you
99:32 can't do it we've been there done that
99:33 can't do it so I go back to my bag of
99:37 tricks
99:37 having read books on this on how Carmack
99:41 did what he did and so I developed a
99:45 technique to do all my math and integer
99:47 math in the last second slam it into one
99:51 floating point variable for each led I
99:54 had to talk to so only at the last
99:56 second was it accurate in memory to make
99:59 the RGB value perfect on the LED POW got
100:04 it to work no problem now I had no
100:07 memory left when this thing was done it
100:09 was like programming my computer as a
100:10 kid in the 80s then I helped you know I
100:14 had a little bit more room to handle how
100:17 things work so when it came to like
100:19 the Hat was charging I can sense that
100:22 the Chargers been put on the chip I
100:24 could see the power going into the
100:28 battery and so I made it breathe so when
100:30 you put the Hat down you plugged it in
100:32 to breathe really cool and then when it
100:34 was done I made it go big big big big
100:36 and then it just turned it off it's cool
100:38 double click man that was like two weeks
100:41 of hell trying to figure out ok I
100:44 clicked it once I click it twice what's
100:46 the amount of interval between the
100:47 clicks and trying to push that in memory
100:49 somewhere where I could memorize it if I
100:51 got that working as well and of course
100:54 debugging and that kind of stuff so get
100:58 into this get into it deep it's a lot of
101:00 fun it is a whole career onto itself
101:03 with YouTube there is no excuse for not
101:05 being able to do anything and everything
101:07 you know I'm not into I used to own
101:10 Lightwave I founded it exceptionally
101:13 difficult to use but it was in the late
101:16 90s kept my license alive for a couple
101:19 versions and then finally just let go I
101:21 never put any time into my ax
101:24 once I saw blender it was over blender
101:26 is gonna be the future and it's free now
101:29 someone might end up buying them and
101:31 then starting to charge money for it but
101:33 hopefully they don't take it to where
101:34 like you know nuke is I think what nine
101:38 thousand dollars or some crazy amount of
101:40 money I mean these companies just need
101:42 to figure out that the volume is the
101:44 best model rate windows sold their
101:48 product for $79 and that's why they took
101:51 over the world right so don't make that
101:53 business mistake if you happen to get
101:55 into a product line but anyway hope you
101:57 dug the episode this is sort of one I've
101:59 been wanting to do for quite a while
102:01 I'll try to fill this thing with a lot
102:03 of photographs of what I'm talking about
102:05 if you have any questions definitely put
102:07 them in the comments section if you want
102:09 to get into probably a massive dialog
102:11 you want to get into the LOC Facebook
102:13 group but that brings us to deep
102:15 thoughts radio.com that's where all the
102:18 feeds are there's two video there's two
102:21 audio there's three social media there's
102:25 four ways to contribute to the channel
102:28 financially and there's an all-new
102:30 reseat remastered season one
102:33 so it came up in this last week here
102:37 that I mentioned in episode and someone
102:38 goes hey where's that episode and it's
102:40 because it was season 1 and so just
102:43 going to the website and type in what
102:47 you're looking for in the search field
102:48 and pal it'll be right there for you get
102:50 a chance to see it so until the next
102:52 episode take care of yourself and
102:54 someone else and I see in the next deep
102:55 thoughts over now
