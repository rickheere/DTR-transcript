00:30 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:32 gentlemen in this nice
00:33 2020 summer bonus season five
00:37 uh by the way somebody said oh man i
00:38 don't understand all these episodes of
00:40 bonus
00:41 season fives what's going on well if
00:43 you're new
00:44 this is the way the format goes it takes
00:46 me about a year to do 100 episodes
00:48 and so while i'm coming up with the next
00:51 brand which will be the new beginning of
00:53 the show
00:54 and make any adjustments to the format i
00:58 come up with this is uh the old format
01:01 i don't think i'm gonna make a big
01:02 format change don't worry
01:06 but uh yeah so these are all bonuses
01:09 just in the summer time while i'm coming
01:11 up with some other stuff kovid's
01:12 delaying things a little bit
01:14 because you know trying to find work is
01:16 a little more
01:18 hit and miss than it usually is this
01:19 time of year
01:21 but thanks for moving forward things are
01:23 happening it should be pretty
01:24 mind-blowing if i can get
01:26 done what i'm working on here we have a
01:29 new episode
01:30 you already know what it's about
01:34 so i was talking to a friend of mine and
01:39 there is a big thing happening in los
01:43 angeles just so you know
01:47 i hope it's it happening in your area as
01:49 well
01:52 but we're talking and
01:56 what's catalyzing this episode to exist
02:00 is that a bunch of liberals
02:03 in los angeles who
02:05 [Music]
02:07 and i'm not saying they're conservative
02:09 necessarily we're all pretty much in the
02:11 center as human beings we're a little
02:12 better right a little bit left in us
02:14 we're just human beings right
02:18 but she has found out that a bunch of
02:20 her super liberal
02:22 professional friends these are business
02:24 owners these aren't just average
02:25 citizens
02:26 and i hate to put a plateau between the
02:28 two but
02:30 it is always more amazing when a
02:33 business owner
02:35 who's been thought through a lot more
02:37 than a worker bee
02:39 wakes up because it catalyzes the
02:42 situation right
02:43 wakes a lot of other people up when a
02:45 professional walks in who's
02:46 got their game tight and they're having
02:49 their businesses destroyed by the
02:51 [Music]
02:53 politicians of california which are
02:54 almost you know
02:56 all the ones making the bad decisions
02:57 are all democrats
03:00 just so happens to be that way this
03:01 particular time
03:05 but they're waking up to several
03:09 different things but the big thing
03:11 that's waking everyone up right now and
03:12 we're talking about
03:14 four different sources coming to one
03:15 person none of which are talking to each
03:17 other
03:18 all female all probably over
03:21 40 with maybe one exception in their 30s
03:25 all business owners
03:28 have stumbled into the human trafficking
03:32 threat way beyond epstein
03:36 way beyond epstein and
03:40 some of them have children some of them
03:42 are going to have children at some point
03:44 and there's nothing like the scorn of a
03:46 woman when you
03:48 hurt a child and that woman appreciates
03:51 the idea of having children and
03:53 protecting them in this world
03:55 it's the innate ability of a woman to
03:58 understand that
03:59 and so what is going on
04:03 is nothing shy of a
04:07 like a miracle of awakening
04:11 plus now a lot of you know about this
04:14 movement i've mentioned it
04:15 a year and a half ago at least the
04:17 hashtag walk away movement
04:20 is going to a second phase of
04:24 it's it's been snowballing ever since it
04:25 started let's just put it that way but
04:27 right now i
04:28 guess i haven't followed it in a while
04:30 the testimonies are starting to speed up
04:33 it's every race it's every group of
04:35 people but that's
04:36 also catalyzing these people to wake up
04:41 but we're talking and they are trying to
04:44 find their information
04:46 um what's interesting about the people
04:48 in los angeles is everybody knows
04:50 someone who's into
04:52 or has been in every nook and cranny of
04:53 the world from the ultra
04:56 ultra rich to um
04:59 the perverts and freaks in hollywood
05:02 when you live in this area
05:03 most these people lived here their whole
05:04 life so they have even more information
05:06 than i do in some cases
05:08 but it's like a relative an uncle an
05:10 aunt a brother a sister a mom a dad
05:13 who have had their professional circles
05:15 in these environments and then come home
05:17 with these stories over the course of 40
05:19 50 years
05:20 telling their kids things when they got
05:22 old enough and of course
05:23 sometimes it goes one in one ear out the
05:25 other because they can't apply context
05:27 to it
05:28 because of what's going on this last
05:30 three and a half years
05:33 now the evidence is starting to come out
05:35 people are starting to go to jail
05:38 but i'm talking to this friend of mine
05:40 and we're
05:42 talking about news in general
05:45 and what's interesting is these people
05:47 that have
05:48 awakened if are going through that
05:50 initial phase of oh my god
05:52 this information is dead to rights you
05:54 can find it in the courts
05:56 court filings as proof that these people
05:59 are being charged some of these people
06:00 gone to prison
06:01 some people are pending they've gone to
06:03 jail and they're pending their case
06:05 and they're saying look none of this is
06:06 being covered
06:08 there's all kinds of memes on the
06:09 internet about this right there's a
06:10 famous meme
06:12 that's moved around where there's an
06:13 elephant in the room and it says you
06:15 know
06:15 human and child trafficking it's a big
06:17 elephant in the room and
06:18 the press is filming you know the virus
06:22 the blm on the side not that those
06:23 things aren't important
06:24 it's just how about some news
06:28 but since we all know that the press is
06:32 completely co-opted globally
06:34 and i mean globally anything you think
06:37 is right that's for you
06:38 it's it's co-opted anything that's left
06:40 well it's definitely co-opted
06:42 it's all agenda 21 european union stuff
06:45 right
06:47 but the same corporations again i've
06:49 again when i did my research of all the
06:51 corporations that own the press
06:52 it came down to four because of some
06:54 mergers i still hear six
06:56 so who cares six to four is ridiculously
06:58 small a group of people controlling
07:00 your perception of reality but now
07:04 you need to hear these words and you
07:06 need to say them to yourself
07:08 you need to challenge this in your mind
07:10 to see if you think this is true
07:13 but i think you'll find this is very
07:15 very true
07:17 in terms of information news agencies
07:21 that are supposed to give you a
07:22 perception of reality that is accurate
07:25 and unbiased
07:26 meaning it shouldn't have any private
07:28 for-profit mechanisms attached to it
07:32 there is no more news in this world
07:37 there's no news what there are
07:43 is movie projectors
07:46 projecting narratives at you now if
07:49 you're a hardcore listener this is
07:50 really no
07:51 epiphany to you except for maybe one
07:53 distinction
07:55 hearing those words there is
07:58 no news the only news that we have in
08:01 this world is given to you
08:03 by people that you know and trust
08:07 because to get a video just off twitter
08:10 to get a video off youtube get a video
08:12 on facebook
08:13 etc etc instagram whatever you can't
08:16 trust it if you don't know
08:18 who took it and what context it was
08:21 taken in
08:23 someone gives a speech for two hours
08:24 they'll cut out two seconds
08:26 and then they make you feel like the
08:27 person said something they didn't say
08:29 it happens to people on the left it
08:31 happens to people on the right
08:33 all to demonize whatever narrative
08:36 they're trying to put
08:37 put forth or to challenge
08:40 the illusion i think that i want to
08:42 submit to you guys for
08:44 your approval and your evaluation and be
08:46 harsh
08:49 is that we
08:52 i think when these sorts of things occur
08:54 in society where a bunch of stuff is
08:57 boiling to the top
08:58 that's hideous for politicians
09:02 stealing money funding a bunch of crazy
09:04 stuff depopulation
09:06 algorithms going all over the world
09:08 trying to destroy the nuclear family
09:10 trying to promote anything that keeps a
09:11 couple together
09:12 to have a child because they recognize
09:14 the fact that there's an indian an audi
09:16 and we gotta make those things work
09:17 together
09:18 and then after you conceive a child make
09:21 the child the number one asset in your
09:22 life
09:23 it's no longer about you and your
09:25 destiny
09:26 right you can there's plenty of room god
09:28 built the universe such that you can't
09:29 get your kid to a stage where
09:31 your life returns but for the first you
09:34 know
09:34 half decade to a decade you better be
09:36 feeding that kid full of every great
09:38 dream and
09:39 hope and vision that they can use as a
09:42 foundation for the rest of their life
09:44 challenge their intelligence speak to
09:46 them like adults so they grow up to be
09:47 adults
09:48 don't google them all over the place
09:50 right
09:52 but right now because a bunch of stuff
09:54 that's been going on
09:56 technically for centuries right
10:00 human traffic has been going on for
10:01 centuries it takes on different forms
10:04 different techniques are used to harvest
10:06 the human beings as society wakes up and
10:08 says this is bad
10:09 right slavery was abolished technically
10:12 in america
10:13 in the 1800s but technically speaking
10:16 you know if you want to have anything in
10:18 life you become a slave
10:20 to a corporation you can't have your own
10:23 business because
10:24 that's not the way we run the world
10:25 anymore you can but you got to work
10:27 extremely hard for it
10:29 and then there's a million forces to
10:31 knock it out of your hands
10:32 there's a million mechanisms used to
10:34 steal your inventions
10:37 your services whatever there's entire
10:40 countries like china
10:41 who have divisions inside their ccp
10:44 communist
10:44 country or communistic layer of politics
10:49 that are charged in a military capacity
10:52 to steal all
10:53 intellectual property that comes into
10:55 their manufacturing
10:57 even the stuff that's not brought there
10:58 is purchased and brought over
11:01 and dismantled to then be copied and
11:03 pirated and sold
11:06 they're at war with everyone who's not
11:09 on board with them
11:11 okay it's a little uh antiquated
11:14 but antiquated people will think
11:16 antiquated thoughts
11:18 it's just that simple once you rise up
11:20 in the
11:21 consciousness of mankind you increase
11:23 your vibration from mega low
11:25 to mega high there's always a better way
11:27 than stealing
11:28 there always is but they're everywhere
11:30 they're in every country right there's
11:32 people stealing stuff in america right
11:33 now
11:34 there's people that will reverse
11:36 engineer my hometown and we had a guy
11:38 who invented a company called bird view
11:41 the first satellite dish companies in
11:42 the united states of america
11:44 well one of his employees got pissed off
11:46 at him don't know what the deal is or
11:48 maybe done
11:48 did get pissed but he moved down the
11:50 street literally like five miles away
11:52 and started eagle
11:53 satellites which basically stole all the
11:57 technology
11:57 and he was a competitor automatically it
12:00 happens right
12:01 we had a radar gun company called custom
12:04 electronics with the k
12:06 still a big big company in this world
12:10 well someone defected at that kind
12:12 company and made mph for miles per hour
12:14 and he made a
12:15 gun and took his company to tennessee to
12:17 get two dollars 15 cents per hour
12:19 labor so it happens everywhere the only
12:22 news i'm not trying to
12:22 pick on folks in particular
12:26 but we have to be able to call a spade a
12:28 spade right
12:31 so things are boiling up the epsteins of
12:34 the world
12:34 have balled up this maxwell maxwell
12:37 woman
12:38 who's his girlfriend and sidekick is now
12:41 claiming that she did nothing wrong
12:42 you know i mean the audacity of these
12:44 people
12:46 and you better believe she'll disappear
12:48 she'll
12:49 commit suicide or she'll be kidnapped
12:52 and then they'll say she got suicide
12:53 whatever
12:54 it'll be the same game
12:57 and you know i want to take this
12:59 opportunity to clarify
13:00 a few things because i've talked to a
13:03 very good friend of mine i've known for
13:05 29 years
13:06 and we were talking about
13:09 blm and a bunch of stuff he's black i'm
13:11 white we know each other forever like
13:13 brothers from another mother
13:14 and uh you know
13:17 his perception he kept saying to me you
13:19 know i know you're a big trump supporter
13:20 i know you're a big trump supporter
13:22 and honestly speaking i like i like a
13:25 lot of what this guy's done
13:26 i like the fact he goes after pedophiles
13:28 i like the fact he's killing the drug
13:29 trade i like the border because it kills
13:31 the drug trade it's not about keeping
13:32 mexicans out don't kid yourself
13:35 but i'm not happy with the way the virus
13:37 is handed handled
13:39 i'm not happy with him letting fachi go
13:42 to the podium when fat she's an absolute
13:43 criminal
13:44 i don't like the way he didn't put
13:46 together a commission very quickly to
13:48 address police brutality which does
13:50 exist in this world
13:51 i don't like the fact he hasn't
13:52 mentioned private for profit prisons
13:54 being a giant portion of our problem
13:56 and the indoctrination you can't turn
13:59 prisons into profit systems because
14:02 you're going with the six-month
14:04 check fraud issue and because the guards
14:06 will work with the
14:07 the the cars you know the leaders of
14:10 those
14:12 skinheads or the crips of the bloods or
14:14 the mexican gangs of the asian gangs
14:15 they'll work with those leaders
14:16 set that dude up to have to go hurt
14:18 somebody well it's all set up
14:21 they don't really have to have anybody
14:22 hurt but they want to get that guy on
14:23 attempted murder to give him 10
14:25 20 years because he's 85 000 a year
14:28 on average to the prison they just build
14:31 their own annuities
14:32 well you shouldn't have screwed up you
14:34 shouldn't have had a minor infraction
14:36 because now you're going to get a major
14:37 infraction and you have a chance of
14:39 dying every single day you're in prison
14:42 i don't like that but at the same time
14:46 as my friend reminded me totally
14:49 disliking
14:49 trump uh he said well you know what we
14:53 really don't know what's going on so i
14:55 don't know
14:55 i'm like yeah it's true why because
14:57 there's no news
15:00 there's no news probably our entire
15:03 lives depending on how old you are
15:05 there's been no news
15:07 i would say definitely 21st century up
15:11 there's definitely been no news
15:15 we know we've caught several times
15:18 a few different things that have
15:20 occurred
15:22 one you know we know that news agencies
15:25 have faked it being at locations when
15:27 they're not at locations
15:28 you know there was the famous baghdad
15:30 one back in 91 where cnn went up to the
15:32 roof in l.a
15:33 put a bunch of palm trees up there and
15:34 said they were in baghdad and faked
15:36 incoming missiles and then they kept the
15:39 camera rolling we've got the extra
15:40 b-roll footage of them going
15:42 did you get my coffee memory brand there
15:44 in l.a
15:46 the other day there was one where a
15:47 woman was talking to the camera
15:49 supposedly talking to a woman in some
15:51 other location i can't remember where
15:52 she's supposed to be
15:53 and a bus like a new yorker bus went
15:56 behind the camera because they always
15:57 film with that window in the back
15:59 and then a few seconds later that bus
16:01 went behind the woman
16:02 who's also standing next to windows
16:04 supposed to be in a different city
16:05 different state and in the continuity
16:09 lock them both in the same location you
16:11 don't get a new york bus in toledo ohio
16:12 right
16:16 the other one is that we have these
16:18 compilation videos where we see
16:20 that in one particular day when they
16:22 want to roll out some
16:23 associated press slash reuters same
16:26 place people
16:27 roth child owned all scooped up in 2004
16:31 i believe
16:32 you know reuters bought ap in 2004.
16:36 they all say the same words you know
16:38 little tiny
16:39 station in wichita kansas will say the
16:42 same thing as miami florida's new york
16:44 is la
16:44 san francisco dallas chicago they're all
16:47 saying the exact same words
16:49 the only difference is that sometimes
16:51 the newscasters will transpose a single
16:53 word
16:53 it means the same thing they're just
16:55 reading the teleprompter incorrectly
16:57 most of the time it's dead on
17:01 theater movies
17:05 the q anon guy and i want to let you
17:07 guys know a video i retired i retired
17:10 all the corona videos
17:11 because the information is now no longer
17:14 useful
17:15 because we've seen a lot of things
17:17 develop and i just you know
17:18 if i'm going to visit that i'll visit
17:20 brand new but it was a video that was
17:22 turned off
17:23 it was mark unlisted and
17:27 youtube just let me know that they that
17:30 they canceled the video they they
17:31 removed
17:32 it in the history of this show they have
17:34 never removed a video ever
17:37 and what's funny is they didn't remove
17:39 it because they watched it
17:41 they removed it because it had q anon in
17:43 its name
17:46 all my videos it was coronavirus
17:50 and cubanon was the name of the video
17:51 now for those of you who saw the video
17:54 you'll know that i gave it was recorded
17:56 i believe in the smoke lounge
17:58 i was dreaming humanon
18:01 for talking too much and doing too
18:03 little
18:05 well they obviously didn't watch it
18:06 because that's the narrative they
18:07 actually want to support is that he's a
18:09 fraud
18:10 i don't think necessarily he's a fraud
18:12 it's just that uh it's funny
18:14 they went after it now i've got other
18:16 keeping on videos that are in the past
18:18 that they haven't attached yet just give
18:20 them time right
18:22 it also i think was watched 2600 times
18:25 which
18:26 on average that's a pretty kind of low
18:29 high
18:29 rating for me high high would be 30 000
18:32 right
18:34 and again i just want to let you know uh
18:37 the funny thing they're doing with my
18:39 moon episodes like 165 and 20
18:42 25. you know 26 and 165
18:47 i remastered 26 on a different channel
18:49 but those videos get watched
18:51 hundreds of times in a week but the
18:54 overall
18:54 counts goes up like one or two so
18:57 they're messing with all the counts
18:59 constantly on this channel which means
19:01 the information is most likely valuable
19:03 to you
19:04 is most likely closer to what one might
19:06 term as
19:08 news right
19:11 but the reason why i mentioned q anon at
19:13 this point is that
19:14 he has been saying something for at
19:16 least a couple years now which is you
19:18 are the news
19:23 now we have a challenge on our hands
19:26 because we know that there's an
19:27 army corps of psyops there's definitely
19:30 lots of
19:30 pr firms that are being hired by george
19:33 soros dnc
19:35 probably other conservative groups and
19:37 they're putting out
19:39 metric tons of disinformation
19:44 so you know some of that was just posted
19:47 on i think the deep thoughts facebook
19:49 page which is good it was because then
19:50 we get to evaluate it what have you
19:52 but um there'll be these outrageous
19:56 claims that when you try to
19:58 evaluate the data and try to find any
20:00 proof of it which usually is not
20:02 terribly difficult if you know what
20:03 you're looking for you know
20:05 um it's just a bunch of misconstrued
20:09 stuff and
20:12 we have to be careful about that as well
20:16 but all this stuff is boiling to the top
20:19 and it gives us the illusion that it's a
20:22 recent problem
20:24 as opposed to uh a problem that's been
20:27 going on for a very long time
20:30 i mentioned to you guys several times
20:32 the lunacy of
20:35 milk cartons when i was a kid i remember
20:37 being about seven years old i was living
20:39 out in the country
20:40 in kansas and it was the first time
20:43 these milk cartons were
20:45 coming into the household with kids
20:46 faces on the side it was obviously
20:48 happening at school all the time because
20:49 he used to give us chocolate milk and
20:51 something in the morning at school but i
20:54 had him at home too
20:57 and i remember asking my mom you know
20:58 what's up with these these milk carts
21:00 right
21:01 and it was always you know well you know
21:03 if you see these kids
21:04 you know you're supposed to report them
21:07 and the lunacy of that whole thing is
21:09 that kids don't travel in new circles
21:11 constantly right we go to school we come
21:13 home we go to school we come up and that
21:15 lasts from k
21:16 through 12. maybe at 15 or so when you
21:20 in kansas you can start driving a car
21:21 it's at 14 legally
21:23 and at 16 you get your full license you
21:25 can drive anywhere you want
21:27 whereas in california it's 16 to 18. so
21:30 it's uh two years delayed
21:32 yeah okay so i might drive to a city and
21:34 see some kid but these are little kids
21:36 on the milk gardens it's not 14 15 year
21:38 olds just little kids the only time
21:40 you're gonna bump into kids that are
21:41 little that you're paying attention to
21:42 is when you're a kid
21:45 okay so my my grade school probably had
21:48 60 people in it
21:49 because i lived in a little town but
21:51 what the cabal loves to do in my opinion
21:53 is to show you
21:54 a reason to be terrified we're eating
21:57 your kids
21:58 and here's the picture of the last batch
22:00 that we did
22:01 imagine the perversion and satisfaction
22:04 of these satanists
22:05 who you know they're sacrificing some
22:08 kid to moloch
22:09 at the epstein island right and by the
22:12 way
22:13 was that general flynn's attorney this
22:15 woman
22:16 has fully confirmed the frazzle drip
22:18 video
22:19 she's fully confirmed anthony weiner's
22:21 laptop as being
22:24 a horrific group of thousands and
22:27 thousands of emails and photographs
22:29 that that she confirmed that the new
22:32 york police
22:34 you know which i guess 20 people have
22:36 been murdered now who've seen the laptop
22:38 stuff
22:40 they puked their guts out so it ain't a
22:42 rumor anymore
22:44 okay and so she's recommending the
22:46 laptop be given to the government for
22:48 prosecution so
22:49 gitmo being heavily upgraded in
22:52 preparation of mass arrests
22:54 is most likely definitely uh now for me
22:57 it's very legit
23:00 uh when you start studying sort of like
23:03 these
23:03 it's funny because i think that they
23:06 feel like a lot of this stuff is a
23:08 success for them
23:09 if they ever get away with a crime
23:12 especially a horrific thing
23:13 they love it when they get to make
23:16 movies
23:17 um for instance take movies up until
23:20 about 1970
23:22 right almost all the movies
23:25 were good homegrown films even if there
23:28 were
23:29 um scary movies from time to time
23:33 they still were like you could watch it
23:34 like my mom saw movies that were
23:36 uh forget what the uh it was the the
23:39 haunted or something like that which was
23:40 like the 1962-64 movie
23:43 and it was just brilliantly done it was
23:45 about a haunted house right it was
23:46 redone with
23:47 owen wilson later i might have the name
23:49 slightly off or something like that
23:52 and then the 70s what did we get we got
23:55 the exorcist we got carrie we got the um
24:01 rosemary's baby texas chainsaw massacre
24:06 there was this halloween and
24:10 friday 13th we get this huge injection
24:13 of utter
24:14 mental perversion to one to see
24:17 the most horrific things the man should
24:20 never see
24:21 texas chainsaw massacre what's that all
24:23 about right well he kills people cuts
24:25 their faces off and wears them
24:28 what's frazzle drip luma aberdeen
24:31 hillary clinton
24:32 killing this girl as a sacrifice to
24:34 moloch it's not just a
24:36 drug induced thing it's a ritual right
24:38 which is why they keep the video that's
24:40 why the videotape it's a very important
24:41 thing for them right
24:43 they cut this girl's face off and put it
24:46 on their face
24:48 that's why people threw up right
24:53 okay i guess uh we need all that
24:56 um you know you can't tell me what to do
24:59 attitude
25:00 right you can't tell me i can't make
25:01 this movie well no we can't
25:04 but why would you want to do in the
25:05 first place right
25:07 when you look up um well in fact you
25:09 don't even have to look it up
25:10 it just airs on tv sometimes right there
25:14 was i i know history channel or
25:16 something but i saw a very official
25:17 documentary
25:18 on the satanic cults of staten island
25:22 and growing up in the midwest you know i
25:24 know there's
25:25 i don't even know they were called
25:26 burrows at the time but and i didn't
25:28 know that new york was a bunch of
25:29 islands and stuff you know pushed
25:30 together
25:32 i didn't know what staten island was i
25:34 didn't know you could only get there by
25:36 ferry
25:37 for a long time it was like this
25:39 sequestered place
25:42 and you find out that again the official
25:44 narrative
25:45 of the official history was that that's
25:48 where a huge satanic cult
25:50 um brought up a satanic church and
25:53 all of a sudden the kids started
25:54 disappearing
25:58 interesting why wasn't that on the news
26:02 right why isn't uh you know bill clinton
26:04 going to epson island 27 times on the
26:06 news
26:07 why isn't the fact that hillary went
26:08 there six times left behind the secret
26:10 service once
26:10 why isn't that on the news bill left him
26:12 behind five or six times too
26:16 will ferrell went there will smith went
26:19 there
26:20 dershowitz went there on and on
26:23 and on and that's only if they use his
26:26 plane the lolita express to get there is
26:28 it on his journal
26:29 if you had a private small plane which
26:31 you can rent and charter
26:32 you go there as many times you want you
26:34 wouldn't be on the roster
26:36 i don't know if there was a rule about
26:37 it but uh what are we gonna do with our
26:40 hero worship
26:45 isn't it interesting that the news
26:48 all of them including fox that thinks
26:52 it's a big
26:52 people think is still a big legit you
26:55 know at least they're telling the truth
26:56 and you know
26:57 i think from time to time people will
26:59 pop up trying to tell the truth
27:01 i don't know if they're there and told
27:03 it to tell the truth every once in a
27:04 while just to anchor people
27:06 in delusion that's kind of what i think
27:10 but they're always looking for juicy
27:11 stories and they'll always pull up some
27:15 some dumb little story that nobody cares
27:17 about right the housewife that lost 80
27:19 pounds and looks great at
27:20 50. okay it's not like it's a bad story
27:23 it's good news it's great
27:25 but what about all these little ones
27:26 right who has done a
27:29 an expose on uh was a maria abranovic
27:34 besides people on the internet people at
27:37 home
27:38 fox news is supposedly right-wing and
27:41 doesn't like
27:42 biden we'll never ever talk about him
27:44 molesting children on cnn
27:46 or sorry c-span i told my buddy today
27:50 so what have you seen by molesting kids
27:52 on c-span
27:54 no you can't believe that stuff giving
27:55 me this [ __ ] that it's deep state
27:57 you know our deep fake [ __ ] it's special
27:59 effects
28:01 and i said dude like stop already
28:05 you know it's like i'm a special effects
28:06 guy i would tell you if it's fake i mean
28:09 give me a break
28:11 trying to deep state that unbelievable
28:14 and it's so
28:14 many so many of those
28:18 things that if you were a decent parent
28:19 you'd knock his lights out and
28:22 stomp his head till he pops i mean you
28:23 wouldn't let this guy exist anymore
28:26 and that's what he's willing to do on
28:28 broadcast television
28:30 what did that guy do behind the scenes
28:32 right
28:34 so you know i mean geez i would almost
28:37 wish that the democrats had picked a
28:39 better
28:40 candidate but you cannot vote for that
28:43 guy
28:44 i'm not really trying to tell you know i
28:46 told a friend of mine who said oh my
28:48 wife just says she can't vote for trump
28:49 i said that's fine
28:51 don't vote for biden just don't go just
28:53 when you go there and you have the
28:55 presidential selection don't click the
28:57 box
28:58 because the little box is going to go on
28:59 your soul you know
29:01 i voted for a pet file that's great
29:05 but you go coma's hairs on his leg right
29:10 but now why make this episode i've
29:13 talked about all this before
29:14 right i'm just bringing up little
29:15 specifics that you may or may not have
29:17 heard of me on
29:18 other episodes definitely some new stuff
29:22 okay well if you think
29:26 and i've been delusional too man i've
29:28 been delusional in episodes right
29:31 like it's funny if i had an index of
29:32 everything i ever said i could just look
29:34 it up in a little keyboard thing it'd be
29:35 awesome i could just retire episodes or
29:37 you know whatever but i can't so i just
29:39 leave them up there
29:40 it's like it's like a bunch of tattoos
29:42 it's just my journey right
29:45 unless somebody tells you those words
29:49 there is no news you might fall for the
29:53 fact that you think something is being
29:55 honest with you
29:56 but now what happens when you change the
29:58 paradigm in your mind to understand
30:00 there is no news
30:02 what does that do to your juices right
30:07 hmm well do you need to know what's
30:10 going on in the entire world
30:12 well because child trafficking yeah sort
30:14 of
30:16 you know when there was the earthquake
30:17 in haiti and one of the hillary
30:18 foundation
30:20 people was caught a woman was caught
30:22 trying to steal
30:23 dozens of kids to take him to the
30:25 airport to fly them out because all
30:27 their parents had died
30:29 that's something you need to know
30:30 because otherwise they're going to be
30:32 like hey
30:32 we can get kids wherever we want you
30:33 know why because nobody ever reports on
30:35 it and no one ever asks in questions
30:41 are these kids your problem
30:45 well it's that old saying you know i
30:48 didn't say anything when they came for
30:49 the so-and-sos and i didn't say anything
30:51 when it came for the other people and
30:52 then all of a sudden they came for me
30:53 and there was no one left to say
30:55 anything
30:55 because i let everybody get lynched
30:59 there's the tin monkey experiment which
31:01 i used to mention a lot and i want to
31:02 mention it one more time because i've
31:04 had to mention to my friends a couple
31:05 times and now they're finally getting it
31:07 which is
31:08 how on earth for all these people waking
31:11 up
31:13 a bunch of them just woke up in the last
31:15 two weeks
31:16 like again these professional
31:19 previously super liberal females
31:23 in los angeles and if that doesn't make
31:26 sense to you because you're not from los
31:27 angeles let me put this in perspective
31:29 for you
31:30 if you want to know what it's like to
31:32 deviate when you live in los angeles
31:34 proper which is where these women live
31:38 the peer pressure and overall
31:40 communicated punishment
31:42 for changing your beliefs from
31:46 super extreme kill the american family
31:48 kill the nuclear family
31:50 promote all this stuff that makes your
31:51 kid completely confused
31:53 vaccinating your kids making them
31:55 [ __ ] all that stuff right
31:58 there's severe punishments in los
32:01 angeles if you deviate and communicate
32:03 that
32:04 um this friend of mine was at a party
32:06 yesterday with a bunch of females
32:09 now secretly well i guess not
32:11 necessarily intentionally secretly
32:15 this woman shows up younger one and
32:18 she's
32:19 trying to act sophisticated and
32:21 intelligent and saying that
32:22 well well we have this guy at work who's
32:25 he's a trump supporter and he's
32:26 religious
32:27 but you know we don't bother him because
32:29 he does really good work
32:33 50 years ago 60 years ago that would
32:35 have been a conversation like this well
32:36 we got a black guy at work but you know
32:39 he does good work so we don't touch him
32:41 right that's the same archetype
32:43 full on discrimination for ridiculous
32:45 reasons it's none of your [ __ ]
32:47 business what somebody's political
32:48 beliefs are
32:49 it is nobody's concern what pigment of
32:51 your flesh
32:52 that's on your body it's not your
32:54 [ __ ] business do they
32:55 do they get hard to do a job sure did
32:57 they do a good job yeah
32:58 shut up then leave them alone it's not
33:02 your responsibility to police the world
33:05 man
33:08 but when you're in los angeles and you
33:10 deviate
33:12 it's like there's a clamp on your body
33:15 now in your mind the thought police is
33:18 thickest
33:19 sin in los angeles to stay that way
33:22 so for these women to wake up and to
33:25 boldly this is what's crazy they're
33:27 taking their social media
33:29 which is utterly littered with other
33:31 liberal friends
33:33 and they are posting on the hour every
33:36 hour that they're conscious
33:38 fragile frazzle drip stuff which is the
33:40 video
33:42 of hillary and uma abedin child
33:45 trafficking stuff
33:46 there's a brand new thing now that came
33:48 out that
33:51 there is a cabal uh conspiracy i should
33:54 say
33:56 where children are being sold
34:00 over the internet in etsy
34:03 anything ebay amazon um
34:08 there's the huawei or whatever it is
34:10 can't remember
34:12 not the chinese one but there's another
34:13 one that's um
34:15 it's used by interior designers to buy
34:18 pillows these pillows cost
34:22 anywhere from three thousand dollars to
34:24 fifteen thousand dollars
34:26 now these interior designers handle the
34:28 richest clients in the world
34:29 billionaires at no point would they ever
34:32 be able to get a billionaire
34:33 to waste ten thousand dollars on a
34:35 pillow
34:36 now you might be wondering well maybe
34:38 these pillows are like
34:40 louis vuitton pillows or some armani
34:43 pillows
34:44 no they're white pillows
34:48 just good old-fashioned white pillows
34:49 like you have on your bed
34:51 and these interior designers when they
34:54 saw it like i might see and go look at
34:55 that crazy crap right
34:57 i don't know if you guys remember but
34:58 when the iphone came out some dude was
35:00 brilliant he created an app that
35:01 cost a thousand dollars and all it had
35:03 was a picture of a huge diamond
35:05 that's all you bought it was a vanity
35:07 thing you spent a grand on that app and
35:08 you could say look i got the app i spent
35:10 a grant on this i'm so rich you know
35:11 watch me throw my phone into the
35:13 pool with these interior designers
35:16 who again serve billionaires my main
35:20 friend
35:20 has served billionaires multiple times
35:23 at no point can specify such a pillow
35:25 and get it to go through because i mean
35:28 somebody's making some serious dough
35:30 okay these pillows by
35:33 a child and so
35:37 this is blowing up on twitter this is
35:38 blowing up in their community
35:40 and they're saying something's really
35:42 fishy about this
35:44 there's an avalanche occurring
35:48 and you don't have to be for any one
35:52 particular leader like i said
35:54 i'm i'm you know there's still some
35:57 things that trump can do
35:59 okay one is getting rid of the fiat
36:01 currency in america and switching it to
36:02 the treasury notes
36:03 the power of that is absolute we would
36:06 have the most valuable currency on this
36:08 planet
36:09 instantaneously so if he pulls that one
36:12 off
36:12 remember federal reserve went from dot
36:14 com to gov
36:16 seems like it's happening a lot of
36:18 articles i read recently says that
36:20 coins are hard to get now cash is hard
36:22 to get now
36:23 etms are running dry all through
36:26 california and it's because
36:27 potentially this change is about to
36:29 occur
36:31 but it has to be you have to duplicate
36:33 in a printing press
36:35 billions of dollars worth of currency
36:36 and distributed to all 50 states which
36:38 was the rumor that came out uh two
36:40 months ago maybe even three months ago
36:44 looks like that's happening maybe right
36:47 looks
36:48 really like that's occurring let's hope
36:50 we don't get some crappy digital
36:51 currency like bitcoin
36:52 it can be manipulated again right
36:56 but the tin monkey thing is an
36:58 experiment they did apparently
37:00 with 100 monkeys where i guess it's been
37:04 done
37:04 more than once which is that they had uh
37:07 what i always call like an agridome
37:09 sealed off area with monkeys up to 100
37:13 and they kind of click anyway okay i
37:16 don't know where this would have
37:16 occurred because that's a lot of monkeys
37:18 used to be in pharmaceuticals and
37:20 getting monkeys was really hard i guess
37:22 these are chimpanzees
37:23 but they grab one they bring him into a
37:25 room and they have him
37:27 sit in this little confined space until
37:30 he makes a machine work and they show
37:32 them how the machine works by human
37:34 being
37:34 it gets a little food pellet they get
37:36 the food pellet first like if you want
37:37 one
37:38 um you're going to have to do this thing
37:40 now they're feeding him obviously in the
37:42 meantime
37:43 and the way that it's told to me
37:45 multiple times is that it took about two
37:47 weeks for the first monkey to learn how
37:48 to do this
37:50 they put him back in the wall for one
37:51 week and study all the other monkeys
37:53 that he comes in contact with
37:55 well since he's clicky he's only got a
37:57 little click he hangs out with so he
37:59 took one
37:59 from the furthest distance physically
38:02 that he has had no contact with
38:03 brought him in there that monkey did it
38:05 in a week
38:06 half the time each monkey they brought
38:09 in
38:11 after 10 monkeys all the monkeys knew
38:14 how to do the machine
38:16 proving beyond the shadow of a doubt not
38:18 only do they have communication
38:19 capabilities but they're not talking to
38:21 each other not like hey okay there's
38:22 this thing you know when you go in there
38:24 push the button you know it works that
38:25 way they're communicating
38:27 through their minds we just don't
38:31 acknowledge that so the paradigm doesn't
38:33 exist a lot of people would say oh
38:34 hogwash doesn't exist
38:37 well for any of you that have ever
38:38 learned something with a professional
38:41 i did not understand this until i
38:43 learned about the ten monkey
38:44 experiment when i learned the guitar i
38:47 learned from two
38:49 wizards one dude was a god and just
38:51 shredded like crazy
38:53 i could sit there having never attempted
38:56 to do what i was doing especially with
38:58 electric guitar
38:59 because my first guitar was acoustic and
39:01 there's a whole way that you have to
39:02 hold the guitar
39:04 you know you mute the strings based on
39:05 what you're trying to do and how you
39:07 play it
39:08 and these dudes would go it's really
39:09 easy just do this
39:11 and i'd look at their hands and i'd see
39:13 it and i'd do it and it was like
39:14 two or three tries i'm doing it
39:17 relatively well
39:19 now of course when they shred it's
39:20 they're going to be
39:22 10 times better than i am but even
39:24 shredding a little bit was a little bit
39:25 easier
39:26 so then i go home the next day and i'm
39:27 you know with my guitar by myself
39:30 and it's like i never took a lesson
39:34 and i have a really good memory so it's
39:35 not like i forgot what i'm supposed to
39:37 be doing i know okay i'm supposed to be
39:38 doing this i did it yesterday
39:39 try to brainwash myself like i'm still
39:41 there doesn't work well
39:43 then i get with them again all of a
39:45 sudden instantaneously
39:47 it works out again and i go home and i
39:49 know what the hell i'm doing
39:50 i i've done this several times in my
39:54 lifetime
39:56 so what i think is happening and many
39:59 people have said this is not even
40:01 remotely profound okay
40:03 many of you said it and you you tell the
40:05 people the same thing is that we have a
40:07 level of consciousness that is happening
40:10 organically on planet earth
40:13 now for people who are spiritual it's
40:15 it's all god and jesus
40:17 potentially for those of you who are
40:19 more astrology
40:20 it's an alien race that's sending us
40:22 beams of whatever
40:25 doesn't matter doesn't matter it could
40:27 be all those things who knows right
40:30 but it's happening and that's a good
40:32 thing i don't know if jesus christ was
40:34 helping the
40:34 chimpanzees figure out the machine i
40:36 don't know if aliens were figuring out
40:37 chimpanzees i mean there was no monolith
40:39 in the room right so
40:40 it's like i think this is just the way
40:43 we
40:43 are programmed how do you think all the
40:45 animals in the world figure out
40:46 everything i mean they squawk everyone
40:48 smile and bark and chirp and whatever
40:50 but there seems to be way more
40:52 distinguished
40:54 communication going on between animals
40:56 than the very dialects and uniqueness in
40:58 their speech
41:00 so it's either a word means ten thousand
41:02 things or they're already communicating
41:05 right think about when you have a baby
41:08 what's your baby dude your baby googles
41:10 and gods and cries
41:11 baby laughs hopefully laughs right but
41:14 they're getting you man
41:16 they you look at your child and if you
41:18 have a beautiful
41:19 connection with your child especially if
41:21 you're loving your child
41:23 your child gets it you know
41:26 i told the story a couple times in the
41:28 past there was a point where my daughter
41:30 was
41:31 old enough to stand up in the crib and
41:34 kind of hang on to the edge of the crib
41:36 and there was a point where he put her
41:38 down and she was just like me as a kid
41:40 can't sleep just kept getting up getting
41:42 up and laughing you know and so
41:44 i always had to be the bad guy right and
41:47 so i'm you know member you know and
41:48 stuff and so finally
41:50 it was time for her to go to bed she
41:52 wanted me completely out
41:53 and so i said okay here's what i'm gonna
41:56 do
41:57 i picked her up and put her down that
41:58 was part of the game i picked her up put
42:00 her down and then she got up she thought
42:01 that was a blast right
42:02 and i mean we must have done it 45
42:04 minutes i was pretty wasted
42:06 and i just came home from work and so i
42:09 picked her up put her down and i put my
42:10 hand on her chest
42:12 and i hated every second of what was
42:14 about to occur
42:16 she attempts to get up and my hand is
42:18 keeping her from getting up
42:20 and i saw tears well up in her eyes
42:24 but i beamed at her i love you
42:28 but you gotta go to sleep you know
42:30 daddy's tired you know
42:32 and i but i sat with her for a while you
42:34 know i sat with her and
42:36 you know let her know i love her and
42:37 make sure it wasn't like you're down and
42:39 i'm out of here right
42:40 and she stayed down
42:44 and if she got up she didn't make a
42:45 bunch of noise but it was like
42:47 one of the worst moments of my life i
42:49 didn't know if i would do it again if i
42:50 had a chance to go back
42:51 but i will tell you that when she looked
42:53 at me and we locked eyes
42:56 it was like i hope she got me right
42:59 but it's when you have these connections
43:02 with other human beings
43:03 you can have with your spouse with your
43:04 own kids brothers and sisters that just
43:06 happen to be like
43:08 my gods like twins even though they
43:10 might look different from each other you
43:11 just have this connection right
43:15 it's a tool but now let's say that you
43:19 completely agree
43:20 that this is possible and i'm not saying
43:23 everybody does
43:24 and i'm not trying to bring with you to
43:25 believe what i believe okay
43:27 let's just say for a second this this is
43:29 true
43:31 then it would be
43:36 a regiment especially if you were
43:38 brought up this way what if they brought
43:39 us up this way
43:40 you know we communicate without
43:43 speaking we also can speak so it's
43:45 beautiful we got two ways of
43:46 communicating right
43:48 but if you were brought up that that was
43:50 the way it actually worked and we had
43:52 way more experimentation and there was
43:53 actually news that
43:55 proved to you showed to you
43:58 then there'd be a little bit different
44:01 way that we would live our lives because
44:03 we would know that whatever we put in
44:04 here
44:05 slash up we have to be careful
44:10 why well we don't want to put anything
44:12 bad in there because we'll put
44:13 bad things out of our system and if we
44:16 became very tuned to it right
44:18 i mean everybody could just smell your
44:21 thoughts right
44:22 be like what are you thinking oh my god
44:24 you think i'm ugly you don't like this
44:26 jacket i got on oh my god just because
44:27 it's like
44:28 10 years old i mean don't hate right oh
44:31 i didn't mean to say that
44:32 i'm just like sorry it's just an honest
44:34 thought i had i'm really sorry i don't
44:35 like it anymore right
44:37 i think you look old whatever it is
44:39 right
44:41 okay let's go back to the initial
44:44 opening statement
44:46 there is no news
44:50 well if we're the news because that's
44:52 all that could be
44:54 done at this point there'd be a couple
44:57 things you'd want to do
44:58 one you want to turn off the news turn
45:01 it
45:02 all off 100
45:05 it's like make it blasphemy to visit
45:07 news
45:09 and all those anxieties you might have
45:11 built up well i got to know this like i
45:12 don't know if uh
45:13 john gervolt's wife died it's so
45:15 important to me to know that it's like
45:17 if it's important to you you're going to
45:18 get a phone call from someone in that
45:20 circle telling you that this woman that
45:22 you know
45:23 perhaps love has passed away
45:26 then it's your business you need to know
45:30 but we still need to know the health of
45:32 the world because now the world got a
45:34 lot smaller
45:34 because we're all communicating more
45:36 over the internet we want to know
45:38 if there's child trafficking you want to
45:40 know there's human trafficking related
45:42 to slavery
45:43 not just sex trafficking right we want
45:45 to know if jonbenet ramsey
45:47 one of our last photos that was ever
45:49 taken has his maxwell chick in the
45:51 freaking photograph
45:52 when daddy was a perv that went over to
45:54 the red light district in amsterdam
45:56 and had women dress up like his daughter
45:59 in larger versions of the outfit
46:00 she wore to competition so he could
46:02 pretend having sex with his kid
46:06 probably important we know especially in
46:09 your local area
46:10 that's what's going on so how do we
46:13 replace the news
46:15 there's got to be a regiment because
46:17 there's too many pr firms out there and
46:19 disinformation firms taking money to
46:22 destroy humanity
46:25 i can't even imagine being married to
46:27 someone who works for these
46:28 organizations who's coming home
46:30 rationalizing
46:31 liquidating the world to make some money
46:34 well you know honey if i don't uh take
46:36 this job then i
46:37 won't have any money one food on the
46:39 table okay then [ __ ] humanity all you
46:42 possibly can
46:43 honey because that's uh that's important
46:45 to us right
46:48 you don't take that job you don't
46:52 you feel embarrassed you ever did you
46:54 atone for
46:55 the rest of your life by trying to go
46:57 out and reverse the polarity of what you
46:58 tried to do to society
47:00 by telling on these people to blow up
47:03 the whole thing
47:05 don't let anybody know you're doing it
47:06 because george soros will have you
47:07 whacked right
47:08 the dnc will have ms-13 at your door
47:11 some rottweilers and some booze right
47:15 the fact that censorship now is the
47:17 method by which they're controlling the
47:19 narrative in this world
47:21 tells you what we all know which is when
47:23 you're you only get the flack if you're
47:25 over the target
47:26 the fact that they went into my channel
47:28 with 530 plus videos and just
47:30 nailed corona and q anon
47:34 they should have nailed all the coronas
47:36 they don't like anything i've said trust
47:37 me
47:39 they might nail this video who knows
47:40 right they'll be up on pitch shoot
47:43 [Music]
47:45 but here's what's interesting so we are
47:46 pissed off that they're censoring us
47:48 right
47:49 i revealed in episode 498 how google
47:53 is a co-conspirator of every mass
47:55 shooting that's ever happened
47:57 that i know about all the mass shootings
48:00 are in their censorship list
48:01 all the people involved their crisis
48:03 actors anyone that would reveal anything
48:06 is all blocked in their sheet and that's
48:09 exactly when they demonetize the site
48:12 okay that's fine right 50 bucks a month
48:15 okay whoop-dee-doo i'll find you through
48:18 some
48:19 more legitimate means and taking it from
48:21 them right
48:23 we have to get
48:26 a little less impulsive
48:30 to become journalists because i see this
48:33 all the time
48:35 we see things that are from these you
48:37 know supercalifragilistic.coms
48:41 posted as truth
48:44 and it's always some [ __ ] title of
48:47 the article to rile you up
48:50 right i saw an article today posted on
48:53 our facebook group i'm very glad it was
48:54 posted
48:55 but it's probably complete [ __ ]
48:56 because i've had a whole team of people
48:59 who heard this rumor and went into
49:01 massive anon mode and said
49:03 i think this is all [ __ ] and it was
49:06 that
49:07 we cut off the world health organization
49:09 from being funded by the united states
49:10 which is 500
49:11 million dollars a year for a lying piece
49:14 of [ __ ] organization
49:16 but that donald trump personally gave
49:19 the bill and melinda gates foundation
49:21 like something like 281 million dollars
49:23 right like you just cut a check
49:25 it's a stupid article everybody's trying
49:28 to figure out what the hell they're
49:29 talking about
49:30 and all it is in the end is a bunch of
49:32 uh most likely
49:34 totally unrelated to the white house
49:36 administration folks that took some of
49:37 the slash fund remember we just cut
49:40 uh a check for corona
49:43 for the stimulus bill right the
49:46 democrats held the house
49:47 help sorry held the white house and
49:49 ransom with all this crap in the bill
49:52 ninety percent of it didn't go to the
49:53 united states citizens right it's these
49:55 little twelve hundred dollar piece of
49:56 [ __ ] checks right that doesn't pay for
49:57 [ __ ] in california gives a guy in kansas
49:59 three months rent right
50:03 they put a bunch of crap in there so
50:05 yeah so something goes through on his
50:07 watch
50:08 they construe it like it's trump
50:11 personally doing
50:12 it it's like seriously
50:15 come on hey i'm dissatisfied with a
50:18 bunch of his his policies in 2020
50:20 right but i'm not voting for a pedophile
50:23 okay
50:24 and i think some stuff is going to
50:25 happen before november that will make me
50:27 a lot feel a lot better about what's
50:29 going to happen here
50:32 so how do we keep ourselves from
50:35 falling for this this info crap
50:39 well slow down that's the biggest thing
50:42 i can tell you
50:44 slow down the knee-jerk mentality
50:47 to make everything that pisses you off
50:50 true first and then you discern it out
50:53 of your system
50:54 because a lot of times you'll you'll see
50:55 it all the time on social media
50:57 someone posts some [ __ ] as truth
51:01 and then you know half your friends
51:03 already know it's crap and they're like
51:04 come on you really think this is true
51:06 this is completely fake
51:07 well uh it's still interesting no it's
51:10 not
51:11 it means now i can no longer trust
51:13 anything that you post because you're
51:14 impulsive
51:16 so if you post something crappy you need
51:18 to
51:20 delete it probably and then post an
51:23 apology and retract it something the
51:24 press never does
51:26 because they're fake
51:29 the other thing is is that we're being
51:31 sold these archetypes
51:33 that um in some cases
51:37 have history and other cases are the
51:40 most bizarre archetypes that are being
51:42 applied to things that make no sense
51:46 example we know that the right and the
51:49 left
51:50 for decades and decades and decades in
51:52 this country
51:54 have been destroying the united states
51:55 of america and maybe the same factions
51:58 in your area have been doing it to your
51:59 country right
52:02 so they have earned our
52:06 discerning disapproval right nancy
52:08 pelosi is 80 years old uh feinstein's 85
52:11 years old maxine waters i think is 80
52:13 years old biden is
52:14 going to be 79 by the year i think or
52:17 the beginning of next year
52:18 he's losing his mind all these people
52:20 have been in charge forever
52:23 but everything's gone downhill during
52:26 their entire administration
52:28 it's both on both sides you know
52:30 o'connell and all these people
52:32 it's like no one's innocent and then i
52:35 hear
52:36 i heard from my buddy today it was like
52:38 there's this belief you should be a
52:39 career politician to be good at what you
52:41 do
52:43 talk about kool-aid going down real easy
52:46 what do you mean dude
52:50 they haven't done anything good ever
52:53 ever ever ever in their entire careers
52:57 nothing zero don't try to talk yourself
53:00 into something because nothing's there
53:02 so then we get a dude from the outside
53:04 he's not part of these cabals
53:06 and boom he's immediately trying to make
53:09 change that everyone's been
53:10 desiring for a really long time oh of
53:12 course they're gonna rile up these
53:13 little
53:14 these little privileged kids that have
53:16 all their parents paying all their bills
53:17 you live in freaking uh you know
53:19 starbucks lobbies
53:21 yeah those aren't real people in terms
53:24 of their
53:25 educated opinion they haven't gotten a
53:27 job yet
53:28 half of them finished a degree yet to
53:29 get a job they're just dis
53:31 disgruntled because they've been the
53:33 sufferers they're stockholm syndrome
53:36 you know subjects of their own party
53:40 but you know you ask cops
53:43 go to rescue kids in basements that have
53:46 been held there for
53:48 half a decade or more and initially
53:52 the kids will say get away from me this
53:54 is where i live this is my home i'm
53:56 secure
53:56 i've managed to make this work this
53:58 horrible environment being great daily
54:00 i've been able to make it work freedom
54:03 what's that
54:04 i don't even know what that is to miss
54:05 it because i wrote that off a long time
54:07 ago to exist in this horrible
54:10 satanic environment in the basement of
54:11 some house i've got it all figured out
54:14 if you bring me out of this i'm not
54:16 going to be able to deal with that world
54:17 so get away from me and these cops have
54:18 to
54:19 you know it's like newt from uh aliens
54:21 right so granny was trying to save this
54:23 kid and she's like you know biting her
54:25 fingers
54:27 how many people uh was it the recipitus
54:30 uh equations of people in prison they've
54:33 been in prison for 20 years
54:34 now they're going to get out and they
54:36 don't want to because they managed to
54:38 make prison war
54:39 and they immediately committed crimes
54:41 then go back in
54:42 get back with their family from the
54:45 outside looking in it doesn't make any
54:46 sense but from their perspective
54:49 which is largely constrained makes sense
54:55 the danger about losing
54:58 a a party that
55:01 previously had legitimately
55:04 the other side of the equation the more
55:06 liberal mindset
55:08 as if that group is going to be
55:10 unrepresented
55:12 potentially if all these pedophiles are
55:14 nailed
55:15 and they're largely of that party
55:18 they're your influencers the will
55:20 smith's the world pharaohs
55:22 the robert de niro also hangs out with
55:24 uh bronovich
55:28 it's going to be hard to say
55:32 unlike the vice that's on la right now
55:33 where you've got to be liberal
55:35 otherwise we're going to persecute you
55:37 and not hire you and all this other
55:38 stuff right
55:39 it's going to invert into an explosion
55:43 the people are going to walk up to you
55:44 and go did you support joe biden did you
55:47 vote for him because that's going to
55:48 determine whether or not we ever talk
55:50 again
55:51 because you should have known he was a
55:53 pedophile and
55:54 insane i can't finish a 30-second
55:57 statement without
55:58 garbling up all of his syllables this
56:01 dude
56:02 is running for the president of the
56:04 united states and can't answer a
56:05 scripted question with the answers on a
56:07 teleprompter right in front of him
56:10 what's going to happen during a debate
56:13 it's going to be a bloodbath
56:15 a bloodbath
56:19 so expect the unexpected man
56:23 this year you need to brace for every
56:27 eventuality
56:28 that you think a cabal could pull
56:31 on humanity right
56:34 but now let's uh let's look at some of
56:37 the
56:38 more unfortunately like tumultuous
56:41 information that's going on right now
56:43 right
56:44 you have a whole collection of idiots
56:46 trying to make this
56:48 recent change in our new norm right they
56:51 love
56:52 this i wanna i wanna meme with uh samuel
56:55 jackson from pulp fiction with the
56:56 ghani's like say new norm again
56:58 [ __ ] you know it's because it's
56:59 like
57:01 okay so um
57:04 you know it shouldn't be a news flash to
57:06 you that you can't just wear anything on
57:08 your face
57:09 anything you want right a handkerchief a
57:12 pantyhose a surgical mask an n95 mask
57:15 you just can't put anything on your face
57:16 and be safe from a virus
57:20 right and of course there's co2 levels
57:22 that go up but i don't think everyone
57:24 and i'm not terribly concerned about the
57:26 co2 except for workers at companies
57:28 having to wear it all day long they need
57:30 to pull it down and get some oxygen in
57:32 their system
57:33 because they're going to blow out their
57:35 ph balance and they're going to be
57:36 susceptible to everything on planet
57:38 earth including bacteria and all kinds
57:39 of other stuff
57:40 influenza which gets a much higher
57:42 capability
57:43 of killing them right
57:46 but what's going on these people who
57:48 don't know anything about science it's
57:50 um
57:50 i know some smart physicists who haven't
57:54 taken
57:55 time to look at the actual atomic
57:56 magnitude of a nucleic acid chain
57:58 and the smallest hole that you can get
58:00 an m95 mask and going
58:02 this doesn't really do anything there's
58:05 always rules about how to work surgical
58:06 mass there's rules about how to apply
58:08 n95 mask
58:10 okay if you followed all those rules you
58:12 might have a hope of something
58:13 but surgical masks are going to do crap
58:16 but the narrative keeps going out wear
58:19 masks wear a mask wear a mask wear a
58:20 mask
58:23 okay i'll tell you when you wear a mask
58:26 this is what this is probably going to
58:27 be my regimen moving forward
58:30 uh until this thing kind of clears up
58:32 but maybe even maybe even during i don't
58:34 know we'll find out
58:36 if i have a coffee cult i might wear one
58:40 i might wear a bandana versus a surgical
58:42 mess but i might wear one because i
58:44 don't want to be passing my thing around
58:46 it's not fair people right right i
58:49 usually don't travel
58:50 around much if i'm sick anyway so this
58:52 is probably like a little visit to the
58:54 to the grocery store i can go through
58:55 drive through it's no problem probably
58:57 able to eat depart in in a restaurant
58:58 anyway for a long time
59:00 okay this is all a subservient thing
59:04 to find out if you're incapable of
59:07 thinking for yourself
59:08 and sadly the majority of every country
59:13 is just a bunch of people that don't
59:14 think for themselves
59:17 not saying they're bad people okay
59:18 they're not bad people
59:20 at all they're just not that intelligent
59:22 when it comes to these particular
59:24 matters
59:26 you know microbiology it doesn't take
59:28 that long to look up a particular thing
59:31 you know you can look up how surgery
59:32 works but you don't have the
59:34 skills to put it together you don't have
59:35 all the contingency tables in your mind
59:37 in case someone starts leaving blues and
59:38 blood pressure
59:39 something goes wrong you're not a
59:41 surgeon at least you can figure out how
59:42 that works
59:44 you can easily look up all these doctors
59:46 doesn't matter how many doctors
59:48 make videos about this and scientists
59:50 make video about this
59:51 they're wrong and bill nye the douchebag
59:54 guy
59:55 is correct unbelievable
60:00 so they're trying to keep that narrative
60:02 going
60:04 bill gates it should be noted most of
60:06 you probably know this openly but he was
60:07 an interview with his wife
60:10 and he says quippingly in the interview
60:14 well you're definitely going to notice
60:17 the second wave
60:20 and he laughs okay well we know the
60:23 first wave was planned
60:25 look at the 2012 london olympics it's a
60:28 joke
60:28 it's right there in your face grim
60:30 reaper corona shaped
60:32 uh lighting system on the stadium a
60:34 bunch of
60:35 patients they're recreating the nine uh
60:37 1918 flu
60:38 sorta except it's a coronavirus instead
60:41 of an influenza virus right
60:43 influenza is stringy and corona is a
60:45 ball with little nubs on it with s
60:47 proteins on the end of the tips right
60:49 okay we cannot have
60:54 the insanity that's going on right now
60:55 continue for much longer
60:57 we can't all businesses will go out of
61:01 business
61:01 right and what they think is going to
61:04 occur is that everyone's going to accept
61:06 it
61:06 right they're trying to diligently in
61:09 the background say that
61:11 you can't get on a plane without a mask
61:14 now it's funny my friend flew on a
61:15 flight the other day and she said she
61:17 went in and they
61:18 they said she had to have a mask to to
61:20 fly
61:22 and they have them to give out to you
61:23 you know and so she took one and she
61:26 just said i put in my lap the whole fly
61:27 didn't put it on no one came after me
61:29 now flights are so dirty literally
61:32 just the the the hip assist or is what
61:36 they call the systems to scrub all the
61:37 oxygen
61:38 they're so shitty that everybody gets
61:41 sick on planes
61:42 constantly right so maybe wearing a mask
61:46 might be great then you may want to
61:47 adjust what kind of mask you're wearing
61:48 so you can breathe well
61:50 but yeah it's probably not a bad idea
61:52 just for your health
61:53 and it has nothing to do with viruses
61:55 it's all the bacteria
61:57 coughing and all that kind of stuff so
62:00 yeah you know
62:00 maybe that's not the end of the world
62:02 but it's not the new norm
62:04 we just upgrade our education when you
62:06 know never really thought about the mass
62:07 thing
62:08 i learned a lot about why other cultures
62:10 wear them out of politeness when they
62:11 have a cold
62:12 yeah honestly not the worst thing i've
62:15 ever heard but don't tell me you're
62:16 protecting yourself against viral matter
62:18 wearing a handkerchief because you're
62:21 not
62:22 okay as a matter of fact the spit that's
62:24 coming off your mouth all day long
62:26 making that handkerchief or that cloth
62:28 mask wet wet wet wet it's starting to
62:30 make the outside
62:32 extremely absorbent to everything that's
62:33 floating in the air
62:36 why is this a mystery to everybody right
62:39 because you have people that have no
62:40 control over their life and never ever
62:42 have
62:43 and they get to be important for the
62:45 first time in their life
62:47 they get to lecture you
62:51 and the funny thing is is they hate your
62:53 guts
62:54 the second you don't wear a mask they
62:56 hate you i mean i know it sounds extreme
62:58 but look at all the videos online
63:00 these people hate you they're injuring
63:03 their health by wearing this mask okay
63:05 co2 in the crap on them so ph balance
63:08 off balance that's how you stay
63:10 healthy that's how you catch cancer is
63:12 to have your ph screwed up constantly no
63:14 alkaline system
63:15 going on in your body but what are they
63:17 doing they're telling you without the
63:18 mass that you're going to die
63:20 because you don't have one okay
63:23 well it sounds like that you don't like
63:25 me anyway so by croak
63:27 that's that's awesome right so just let
63:29 me die
63:30 i'd rather die a free man than to be
63:33 some
63:34 serf for some cabal that's been going on
63:37 for years
63:39 and that's what it is that's exactly
63:42 what it is man
63:43 because it makes no scientific sense
63:44 whatsoever and the fact that the head of
63:46 the cdc is willing to lie to you about
63:48 that
63:50 should tell you something when i worked
63:52 in the pharmaceutical industry again
63:54 this covert project i made was all about
63:57 getting the project
63:59 conceptualized i don't know why it was
64:01 covered quite frankly i don't know
64:02 i think it was just because when you
64:04 deal with the lead chemist you're not
64:05 supposed to
64:06 be an average person because they talk
64:08 about the fact they can make cures but
64:10 they don't they talk about
64:12 death tolls and clinical studies that's
64:13 just jaw-dropping and you're not
64:16 supposed to know that kind of stuff
64:17 that's generally why they keep it secret
64:19 right
64:21 but it was to get something through
64:22 clinical studies as quickly as possible
64:23 conceived
64:24 into clinical studies through clinical
64:26 studies as quickly as possible
64:27 i went and worked in clinical studies
64:29 after this
64:31 and they just basically let me know that
64:34 the fda
64:35 was a bought off organization and then
64:38 you learn about aspartame in the early
64:39 80s and you realize it was completely
64:41 sabotaged
64:42 during aspartames pushed through the fda
64:45 it's the last time the fda ever had any
64:47 balls it was 1979 1980
64:49 when reagan got in he didn't know what
64:51 he was doing he signs a piece of paper
64:53 they'd already figured
64:54 out who to replace people with it was
64:56 corrupt from that point
64:58 all right you think the cdc is better
65:02 you think the epa doesn't get bought off
65:04 what are you nuts
65:06 every single government agency is
65:09 appointed
65:10 not elected and that means they are
65:13 susceptible
65:14 to every form of bribery that could
65:17 possibly occur
65:18 when the fda got liquidated in the early
65:20 80s the pharmaceutical companies were
65:22 like cyril
65:23 who think was bought by monsantos
65:25 eventually
65:26 he's not been bought by bear they said
65:30 we went into the fda and we gave
65:32 everybody
65:33 the opportunity to have i believe what
65:36 they call the golf course retirement
65:38 package
65:40 which was we're going to give you so
65:41 much money you can play golf for the
65:42 rest of your life and
65:43 half of them took that deal and the
65:45 other half said i'm going to protect
65:47 humanity
65:49 and so what happened donald rumsfeld he
65:52 ran cyril
65:53 probably contacted his buddy uh george
65:56 bush senior
65:57 i'm just making that up but somebody did
65:59 something because they arranged
66:01 for all those people that stayed to be
66:03 fired
66:05 and they put in all these lobbyists some
66:07 of them from
66:08 searle went in there and immediately
66:10 said aspartame
66:11 great boom and then brain tumors
66:14 exploded in the 80s
66:16 remember ted kennedy always drank a big
66:20 can of diet coke i think donald trump
66:22 drinks that [ __ ] too
66:24 and what he died of spontaneous brain
66:26 tumors
66:28 interesting right doesn't matter how
66:31 rich somebody is they could be dumb as a
66:33 bag of hammers when it comes to their
66:35 health
66:37 a buddy of mine lost his father and he's
66:40 the first person to tell me because my
66:41 father was diabetic
66:42 he had toes amputated off his feet but
66:45 he still wouldn't go to the doctor to
66:46 get his diabetes
66:47 regimen he died of it
66:51 you know i don't blame you for not trust
66:52 the doctors but jesus once you get your
66:54 toes cut off
66:56 whatever you got to do man do it get
66:59 some second opinions if you don't trust
67:00 your doctors go to a foreign country
67:03 you know you could corner a doctor with
67:05 the money this guy had and just said
67:06 look i don't give you a hundred thousand
67:08 dollars you just tell me the truth
67:09 right and then prove everything you say
67:11 the dude's gonna set you up
67:14 royal right but to get back on track
67:19 we have to purify our vessel
67:22 okay the best way to do that in my
67:25 opinion because it's a multi-dimensional
67:26 experience you have to purify your
67:28 intent towards the world
67:31 wish people the best figure out how to
67:33 do that
67:34 most of you probably already do it's a
67:36 natural state of mankind
67:38 we're in this together whether or not
67:39 you're a hermit or not you're still
67:41 probably producing
67:42 a product or service that serves the
67:44 masses like for instance you could be
67:46 a film writer and you're writing great
67:47 inspirational films but you're scared of
67:49 the public so you never go out but your
67:50 films get made and then you're
67:52 inspiring billions of people and it's an
67:54 airline to society they can watch
67:55 forever
67:56 create a piece of software that helps
67:58 someone create music or
67:59 a piece of artwork or new finances
68:01 better you're
68:03 helping the world maybe you just unclog
68:06 drains
68:07 maybe you dig ditches we need these
68:10 things people pick up trash all the time
68:12 man i can't even tell you but if people
68:13 didn't pick up trash one week
68:15 my neighborhood would start smelling
68:16 four days later
68:18 everybody's important so once you
68:20 cleanse your intent
68:23 which probably is not a big leap for any
68:24 of you you're probably already where you
68:25 need to be
68:27 then we have to start you know maybe
68:30 applying that old adage where
68:34 we treat others as we would have them
68:36 treat us
68:38 now the interesting thing about that
68:39 statement which i've mentioned a couple
68:41 times in episodes
68:44 the one thing that doesn't work because
68:46 that one i think works
68:48 treat others as you would have them
68:49 treat you just don't expect them to ever
68:52 return the favor
68:53 in your lifetime because we are now
68:56 in the utterly self-absorbed short
68:59 attention span theater
69:00 version of society as the kgb guy said
69:03 in 1985
69:04 in his interview where he said we have
69:06 taken over the united states of america
69:09 and we can now show an american the
69:11 truth and they will reject it
69:14 and boy was that dude ever right if you
69:16 want to see that interview
69:18 just look at kgb um 1985
69:22 interview you'll probably find it
69:23 immediately it's this old 80s videos do
69:25 with glasses
69:26 in there there's a version that's really
69:28 long and there's a version about five
69:29 minutes if you want to see them say all
69:30 the good stuff it's probably the five
69:31 minute one my suggestion is watch the
69:34 five minute one and watch the whole
69:36 thing
69:36 because it will be very telling to you
69:39 but what this accomplishes
69:40 is the following in my opinion
69:44 my friend of mine loved to death i will
69:46 always love him to death
69:48 we work together he was saying a bunch
69:50 of horrible things about trump
69:51 like antichrist stuff and what's so
69:53 ironic about that is he's religious
69:56 and it's like boy if this guy isn't the
69:58 antichrist you can have a very
70:00 embarrassing moment with god you don't
70:02 repent before you're done
70:03 unless he is right we'll see
70:07 but
70:11 we are seeing people treat people like
70:13 crap
70:14 with no proof of the accusations that
70:16 they make
70:17 or the it i'm now like i don't even know
70:21 10 for 10 i have a 500 batting average
70:24 on this
70:25 i challenge people who call trump a
70:28 bunch of news because i'm looking for
70:29 the data i don't really give a crap
70:30 about being right
70:31 but they'll kill some being racist
70:33 they'll use them with excuse them with
70:34 that whatever they want to say and i'll
70:36 say okay fine
70:37 itemize because that's all they put up
70:39 there is some stupid statement
70:40 nothing to back it up with a lot of time
70:43 fake news underneath
70:44 not even the fake fake which has brand
70:47 names like cnn and msnbc there's like
70:49 some weird expialidocious dot com
70:51 thing written by some instigator
70:56 but i'll say fine itemize why the sky is
70:58 bad and give me hardcore proof not just
71:01 your feelings okay
71:04 no one ever replies
71:09 none ever not even an attempt
71:13 and some of these people are famous i
71:15 mean fame is famous they are
71:17 indoctrinating
71:18 thousands of people a day to hate a guy
71:21 that they can't even itemize what the
71:23 hell the issue is
71:25 but if i go hey you think about will
71:26 fern ah he's great i know him i
71:29 did a movie with him blah blah blah i
71:30 was like did you know he went to
71:31 epstein's island
71:32 what oh that gave me true well here's
71:35 the roster where his name is written in
71:36 there
71:37 have you seen the pictures of him at the
71:38 ibranovich cake parties
71:40 with people's heads in the table
71:44 i mean they're real people they suck
71:46 their head through a hole to pretend
71:47 like they're decapitated
71:49 and he's there the cakes are so human
71:52 the first time i showed it to
71:54 a friend of mine she said god why don't
71:56 you show me that stuff i don't want to
71:57 see any of this
71:58 you know like she thought it was a
71:59 chopped up body i said that's a cake
72:02 oh what i said that's a cake all those
72:05 entrails all the
72:06 guts and blood is frosting and a bunch
72:08 of other stuff
72:11 blondie
72:14 blondie cut the cake man the last one i
72:17 got pictures of
72:20 unbelievable
72:23 they're retired they're worried about
72:25 their financial
72:27 status in life and so they're like sure
72:31 man
72:32 i'll get involved with these elites
72:35 you have all this power and money
72:38 we'll just overlook all the satanic crap
72:40 that's going on
72:44 so if you purify yourself a little bit
72:47 to whatever standards you want to hold
72:49 to hold my standards to you whatever
72:52 and i've said it on the show you know
72:54 before i heard uh
72:56 general flynn's attorney a woman who's a
72:57 badass i looked her up and
72:59 oh she's got a hell of a hell of a
73:01 background
73:03 and she legitimized the entire wiener
73:05 computer she legitimized the fragile
73:07 drip video
73:08 i was telling you guys hey let's not
73:10 accuse hillary or omaha abedin if
73:12 something horrific
73:13 i mean horrific it doesn't get any worse
73:16 than killing
73:17 a little girl and mutilating her in the
73:19 process and terrifying her in the
73:21 process
73:22 for moloch this thing that they worship
73:24 right
73:27 okay now
73:30 now i'm gonna lean the other way because
73:32 a very legitimate source came through on
73:34 this
73:36 but we're slinging around because this
73:38 is like chaos we're in
73:40 chaos it's like every day you wake up
73:41 you don't know what nightmare is waiting
73:43 for you right
73:45 but let's flip it to the positive side
73:50 if i've been trying to go negative but
73:52 there just is some
73:54 some bad stuff in there june bugs over
73:57 there and they're
73:58 buzzing on my screen in my house it
74:00 sounds really funny
74:02 which i guess in england they're called
74:03 may bugs is to come out a month early
74:09 the law of attraction is a big thing i
74:12 think most of you know that
74:14 if your life sucks then you should go
74:16 watch my law of attraction
74:18 episode you should watch my episode on
74:20 existentialism
74:22 because we go into that deeply and
74:25 i start off the episode i always remind
74:26 you guys because this is important to
74:28 remember and repeat to yourself in my
74:30 opinion which is to say
74:31 what if the biggest secret of the
74:33 universe is that we control it
74:36 and initially what even happened in my
74:40 mind when that epiphany came to me was
74:41 oh
74:42 i can create everything that i want and
74:45 i can make them like get everything
74:46 positive that i want in this world
74:50 after i thought about it and analyzed it
74:52 and thought about its full implication
74:53 of that paradigm of truth
74:55 potentially was that i'm probably
74:58 responsible for every negative thing
74:59 that's also happened to me
75:02 and what's really weird about it is that
75:07 my life has
75:10 you know over time accumulated more
75:12 negativity
75:14 than positivity and i have a lot of
75:16 positivity in mind don't even wrong
75:19 but it was sort of uh you know i mean i
75:23 i had a childhood that was um i guess
75:26 less than perfect like most of us right
75:27 but i mean overall i look back it's like
75:29 yeah a couple years that were bad there
75:30 in that place and stuff but once i got
75:32 back to my hometown and teaches like 13
75:35 it was blissful until i was uh 17 and
75:39 this is like with heartbreaks
75:40 breakups and all that crap getting fired
75:42 getting hired whatever
75:43 doesn't matter in the end it was pretty
75:45 amazing
75:47 made me who i am today in large part the
75:49 formative years
75:50 came to california okay everything's
75:52 going absolutely fantastic
75:54 i didn't get laid off but then
75:55 immediately two days later i'm drawing
75:56 video games for a living that was
75:58 awesome
75:59 that company falls under or goes under
76:01 because activision's
76:02 trying to sell themselves but i made a
76:04 video game and solid
76:05 ah because that mother of invention
76:07 right
76:08 everything was pretty amazing
76:12 until i moved away from southern
76:14 california i didn't want to move away
76:16 from southern california so i took this
76:17 negative i don't want to be there thing
76:19 to the bay area and barry was getting
76:21 sort of initially
76:22 starting to get raped by the rest of our
76:25 country right now foreigners necessarily
76:27 the people within our country
76:28 coming there and just destroying the
76:30 place right didn't care it's not my
76:32 house it's not my town whatever
76:34 it's like when you go as a kid to a to a
76:36 different town you sort of act like a
76:38 jerk
76:38 as you can it's not your place you're
76:40 never going to see these people again
76:41 it's kind of way the place was being
76:43 treated at the time it's
76:45 not doing too well today
76:49 but then the internet booms ah there's a
76:51 little bit of positivity i
76:53 got a job electronic card so that's
76:55 pretty good too
76:57 but then it gets to um the end of the
76:59 century
77:00 i'm working on this 300 million dollar
77:02 project i'm the lead architect
77:04 and then all of a sudden
77:07 911 happens right because the company
77:09 was having a really hard time
77:11 getting this product made we've made
77:13 some bad decisions we let people make
77:15 bad decisions for us
77:17 and all this negativity was flowing into
77:19 the company it was so bad we had rumor
77:21 sites and people accusing people
77:23 saying stuff i got accused of saying a
77:25 bunch of bad stuff about my fellow
77:27 employees which i didn't do
77:28 it was just nuts so 9 11 was sort of
77:32 like an event in my life that was a
77:34 culmination of what it felt like to work
77:36 at
77:36 ea.com at the time and i know that
77:39 sounds
77:40 impossible because 3 000 people lost
77:42 their lives
77:45 and i will say that it is the graduated
77:47 next level
77:48 of how horrible it felt to work at this
77:50 place the management
77:52 all upside down and just just because
77:55 people didn't know anything about gaming
77:56 people knew about the internet making
77:58 decisions and destroying our opportunity
78:00 we should have been a multi-billion
78:01 dollar product when we were done
78:04 so that happens right so it's like we're
78:06 going to a negative spin
78:07 so just now we're here today right now
78:11 we're here with all this chaos and
78:12 craziness
78:13 we went into war because of 9 11 he
78:16 spent what
78:17 11 trillion dollars to get nothing out
78:19 of it except to kill a bunch of people
78:21 make arabs
78:22 absolutely hate america all to benefit
78:25 the petrol dollar in europe my god
78:29 at some point this has got to stop
78:30 people and then
78:32 to top it all off as we're all waking up
78:35 to all this craziness
78:37 we're finding out in the last three and
78:40 a half years
78:42 at least for me i found out there's been
78:46 a sex traffic ring embedded in the most
78:50 incredible agencies around the world
78:52 and i can't name them but you guys know
78:56 and they have been trafficking children
78:58 and trafficking money and
79:00 carts and you know like in cases uh
79:03 american us dollars
79:04 my uh i had a family member of mine in
79:07 baghdad uncover a complete cabal
79:10 to pay off a bunch of people in the
79:13 middle east for
79:14 things they weren't doing and when he
79:15 mentioned it to his co
79:17 commanding officer uh the commanding
79:19 officer then
79:22 threatened to kill him by putting him on
79:24 a patrol
79:26 that he wouldn't come back from and when
79:29 i heard that i sent it to
79:31 my other family member who worked in the
79:33 pentagon at the time i said look
79:36 i don't know what you guys are up to i'm
79:37 not trying to tell you what to do
79:39 but this dude just threatened my family
79:41 member with death
79:42 for uncovering something that's legit
79:46 see what you can do and i gave him his
79:48 name and then some other stuff out and i
79:50 sent that over to
79:51 and so things got resolved
79:57 so now this machine of law of attraction
80:02 with no news
80:05 no news means everything you take in all
80:07 day long is fake
80:09 unless you get it from a friend or
80:11 unless you see it with your own two eyes
80:14 my god no wonder channels like this can
80:16 succeed because it's like we're all
80:18 trying to share our information
80:20 i set it all up like i'm the spiker no
80:23 sorry i'm the setter right and you're
80:25 the spiker you know it's like here
80:26 boom what do you think about that boom
80:28 comment that's what i think about that
80:30 but every one of you get a ball to spike
80:32 you get to put a comment down there and
80:34 tell me what you think
80:36 the amount of information transferring
80:38 is ridiculous i mean just
80:40 really tremendous i think we have to
80:43 purify ourselves
80:46 make sure your intent is good because
80:47 then you tend not to hold things in your
80:49 system that go against your principles
80:51 i don't want to carry a lie so anytime
80:54 you want to say
80:56 or repeat or you feel like you have to
80:58 say and repeat things that are negative
81:00 because they're that's what that's
81:01 what's out there right
81:04 we then check ourselves we're like okay
81:07 this looks totally legit i'm really
81:09 riled up because i just read something
81:11 that looks really legit
81:12 now a couple things i want to recommend
81:15 one if you have an expialidocious dot
81:18 com
81:19 just stop okay if you want to take the
81:22 information
81:23 write it down you gotta do but you gotta
81:26 go find some legitimate resources and
81:28 it's not going to be the news there is
81:29 no news
81:30 so you're going to have to do what anons
81:32 do which is
81:34 if someone were to say that um
81:39 bill uh was it um bill mayer
81:43 bottle meyer or whatever his name is the
81:44 comedian dude
81:47 he had a corporation called kid love
81:52 which q anon brought up really really
81:55 fast
81:56 in his and his thing
81:59 and they say uh that was a child
82:01 trafficking thing
82:02 which is why he's against trump
82:05 so you're like okay that's a claim then
82:07 you go look it up and you find out oh
82:09 yeah it did exist
82:11 it was called kit love it was really
82:13 bizarre it barely accomplished anything
82:15 and just after cute anon announced it he
82:18 got rid of the corporation
82:20 hmm seems a little bit weird
82:24 someone uh what was it that um
82:28 uh tulsi gabbard the woman from hawaii
82:31 that ran for president
82:32 who's active military right now um
82:36 seems really kind of beautifully centric
82:39 but she does one of these little posts
82:41 she does the illuminati pyramid
82:44 hand gesture
82:47 i guess in her arrogance she it's she
82:50 gets didn't think she's going to get cut
82:51 by the q
82:52 and on folks and of course everybody
82:54 who's aware
82:55 knows what that little salute means it
82:57 means you're not loyal to the united
82:58 states of america you're loyal to the
82:59 banker of
83:00 makers of europe and don't ever get that
83:02 confused don't ever ever trust that
83:04 woman
83:05 for the rest of your life i'm sorry she
83:07 would have to actually
83:08 expose the cabal and cause casualties on
83:11 their end
83:12 in a significant permanent way that they
83:14 are completely destroyed
83:16 then repent and maybe you can let
83:18 literally serve your coffee
83:21 but jay-z does it doesn't he right
83:24 you should look up h.r giger who is a
83:27 major major
83:28 dark bizarre dude if if there's one guy
83:31 that's been to
83:33 those weird parties it's that dude right
83:35 massively talented artist don't get me
83:37 wrong
83:38 i don't know if i'd ever take back the
83:40 alien from aliens and all the movies
83:42 that they've ever made that was under
83:43 his creations
83:45 but he made a thumb cover for blondie
83:47 didn't he
83:49 all right but he made a silver sculpture
83:51 with the hands like this and you can
83:52 actually i think buy a necklace of it
83:56 they're showing you they're showing you
83:59 where their loyalties are
84:00 the 666 up by the eye oh boy
84:03 i know some guys who do that that i know
84:05 personally that i
84:07 know go to church every sunday i don't
84:09 know if they're just
84:10 abject morons that don't know what
84:11 they're doing or they're
84:13 seriously going okay they caught me
84:14 picking up a transvestite on santa
84:16 monica boulevard
84:17 so now i'm going to do whatever they say
84:22 okay i have to do this thing here okay
84:24 just did it
84:25 can i let go
84:29 sad so you're gonna have to do your own
84:33 research
84:35 and you're gonna have to cross-reference
84:36 stuff because one resource is probably
84:38 not enough
84:40 now what's fine in my opinion okay
84:44 this is all my opinion right is that you
84:46 can throw something out there
84:48 because this is what happens a lot on
84:49 the facebook page for deep thoughts
84:50 radio
84:52 it's really nice the way people do it as
84:54 they throw it up there and they go look
84:55 i just found this
84:56 guy shoot this down is this real or is
84:58 this thing let me all jump in
85:02 but right now the what you have to
85:05 understand and i'm sure you already do
85:08 is that the disinfo
85:11 techniques if they were
85:15 a sword and you had to pick a sword
85:17 that's existed in time
85:19 to represent how good they are now
85:22 at disinformation it is the finest
85:27 samurai sword that has ever been folded
85:29 40 to 80
85:30 000 times it can cut through
85:33 an anvil like butter they are
85:37 good at what they do they are great
85:41 at what they do but the good news is
85:45 the good guys are getting really good at
85:46 it as well
85:49 but now just to put this out there as
85:52 we're ending the episode here
85:54 and this is where i have no delusions i
85:57 think that i forgot
85:58 that i might have a delusion at one
85:59 point but i don't have any delusions
86:01 anymore
86:02 which is
86:05 okay so there's a bunch of really bad
86:07 people out there that
86:09 are kidnapping kids killing them they
86:11 keep um
86:13 the constant wave of abortions uh
86:16 for two reasons one to suppress various
86:19 races and two to make sure there's
86:20 plenty of kid parts being sold
86:22 if you have any doubts about that go
86:23 look at project veritas
86:25 stinging uh planned parenthood
86:28 learned the planned parenthood was
86:30 eugenics organization prior to that
86:32 okay so we have a clear more
86:36 bad than like one group's definitely
86:38 looking really bad
86:39 other groups looks way better because
86:41 they're stopping the bag
86:43 what would be ideal and i don't know
86:46 how this could be done and i've
86:48 mentioned this once before but i don't
86:50 know how it can be done that we can get
86:51 rid of the bad guys and never have them
86:53 crawl back up
86:56 and it can be as efficient as
86:59 all royalty is erased all bankers are
87:02 erased
87:04 all corrupt politicians aren't race all
87:06 corrupt corporate
87:07 people have been erased financial people
87:09 all raced somehow gitmo them
87:12 cut their heads off whatever
87:17 but man is flawed
87:20 and imagine that
87:24 what we have today is the result of
87:26 thousands of years of these particular
87:28 families continually
87:29 preserving their wealth over the years
87:34 and they've just been handing down the
87:35 machine handing down the machine they
87:37 teach
87:37 the elite of their family to take it
87:40 over and control it
87:44 and suddenly they get wiped off the map
87:48 okay well just like in the movie wizards
87:51 wizards that i mentioned from ralph
87:53 bakshi you can dig it back up out of the
87:55 ground can't you
87:57 if it's ever been documented of how to
87:58 be this corrupt
88:00 and that documentation that methodology
88:02 can be dug up
88:05 then we have to take measures to ensure
88:08 that it doesn't get dug up ever
88:11 but it stays exposed right
88:16 talking to a friend of mine and uh my
88:18 buddy and i said you know isn't it
88:19 interesting that
88:21 that these antifa infiltrators and these
88:26 people that are trying to help the world
88:27 in some cases are
88:29 knocking down all these statues in in
88:32 the south
88:33 region of america right all these uh
88:35 democrat confederate statues
88:38 who are pro-slavery right
88:41 and of course they're knocking them down
88:42 thinking they're republicans it's just
88:44 [ __ ] hilarious but anyway
88:46 i said isn't it interesting how we keep
88:48 all of the concentration camps alive so
88:50 that you can go
88:51 toward through them so we never have
88:52 another holocaust that anytime it starts
88:54 behaving like that
88:56 we all go whoa whoa this feels like a
88:58 holocaust you can believe whatever you
88:59 want about that event
89:01 those places exist and people were stuck
89:02 in there and they shouldn't have been
89:04 okay so these statues represent slavery
89:08 but now they're tearing them all down
89:11 okay
89:12 so they tear them all down and then they
89:14 can just act like it never happened
89:15 why because that's the democratic
89:17 history they want that [ __ ] torn down
89:22 you know i asked him about um
89:25 angie mima being removed from the
89:28 pancake
89:29 syrup thing and all the pancake stuff
89:31 and all those products that are under
89:32 that name
89:33 and then uncle ben now
89:37 a little factoid i looked up today in
89:40 jemima
89:41 he made a very good point is a sort of a
89:44 late eighteen hundred slur
89:46 for a woman that was a black woman that
89:49 was privileged to take
89:51 i'd say that privileged in a very
89:52 floating quotes
89:54 tent to watch the white kids
89:58 just like gone with the wind
90:02 the woman's name who created anja myma
90:06 her name and we want to give her major
90:08 props here for several reasons okay
90:11 she was born in the uh early 1800's and
90:13 died in 1923.
90:15 her name was nancy green just like the
90:18 color
90:19 no e on the end her maiden name was
90:22 nancy hayes
90:23 or maybe nancy hughes not quite sure
90:28 she took her recipe at the age of
90:31 59. if i read the immaterial right
90:35 to shoot to chicago for some competition
90:38 and just kick their living butts i think
90:42 it was the pancake and the syrup and the
90:43 whole thing right
90:45 and that allowed her to launch her
90:46 company and then someone obviously i
90:49 don't know if it was her
90:50 i doubt it but maybe it wasn't a
90:53 derogatory thing for her i don't know
90:56 but then they called it
90:57 in jamaa if you look at the initial
90:59 boxes where she is represented on the
91:01 box
91:03 it's a black and white print from the
91:06 late 18
91:06 i think it's 1888 or something like that
91:09 she
91:10 um was charcoal black
91:14 with white lips very black face looking
91:18 box
91:18 now i don't know if that's like you know
91:22 it was only going to be black or white
91:23 so i don't know if they had half tones
91:24 to create some sort of
91:25 shade maybe they couldn't do it so it
91:27 was like i don't know what to do you
91:28 know
91:29 instead of creating outline art they
91:31 filled up her face and it looked
91:33 very uh racist
91:36 if you will could have been a limited
91:39 limit of the
91:40 materials i don't know this was an
91:42 actual initial box if you look up on
91:44 wikipedia
91:45 you'll see it nancy green
91:48 uh in the terms of the uncle ben's rice
91:52 that's a very deep story with a bunch of
91:54 folks that had nothing to do with the
91:56 guides portrayed on the box it was like
91:58 in 1946 or so they got to a point where
92:01 they
92:01 took a local rice grower and promoted
92:04 his face
92:05 on this so it may just be a complete
92:06 fictional character
92:10 the african gentleman that they were
92:14 or african-american gentlemen they were
92:15 talking about was getting frank brown
92:18 so they just literally put that that
92:19 brand together so it's not a big
92:21 substantial thing there to have a
92:22 you know an issue with
92:26 but my concern i'm going to communicate
92:28 here
92:29 is that
92:32 they just erase by erasing all of this
92:35 without having
92:37 some sort of contextual replacement
92:40 or what have you is going to get to the
92:42 point where
92:43 you know there's nothing can be named
92:45 after native american
92:47 you know they need to bring the tribes
92:49 together to say okay overall
92:51 are you super offended that it's called
92:52 the redskins because that's sort of a
92:55 you know we call ourselves rednecks and
92:56 we have no offense whatsoever
92:59 uh but maybe that's not good for them
93:01 maybe the chiefs is okay because it's
93:03 just the chiefs but we gotta find out
93:05 you know
93:06 but i don't hear any of those like
93:08 intelligent discourses we just see
93:10 revisionistic history happening it's
93:11 like basically a slow version of book
93:13 burning
93:15 we don't want to be impulsive and change
93:20 in my opinion without really
93:22 methodically thinking it through and
93:23 having
93:24 very legitimate reasons for doing stuff
93:26 we also don't want anything to be
93:28 you know keeping racist terms moving
93:32 forward like they're okay
93:33 but then again it's like
93:37 the problem with political correctness
93:39 is that whatever is good on monday is
93:41 bad on wednesday
93:42 whatever is good on wednesday is bad on
93:44 friday
93:46 uh you know we all know about the n word
93:48 that's used against blacks
93:50 and for forever it's been a bad word
93:54 the replacements uh that were honorable
93:57 at various times in the 19th century
94:00 were colored color was considered
94:04 the first upgrade out of the inward and
94:06 then that became bad
94:07 it was the funniest uh phrase i believe
94:10 it was a doctor detroit or something
94:12 like that without me says uh
94:13 nobody colored me i was born this way
94:16 that was interesting reply
94:18 then by the 60s
94:22 it was negro and that was the upgrade
94:24 like caucasian negro was the same thing
94:26 right
94:27 then somehow that became bad then it was
94:29 black
94:30 black was totally cool no one's really
94:32 black and no one's really white
94:34 so whatever we're just picking colors
94:36 again overall or lighter and darker than
94:38 each other
94:38 and that was bad and it was native
94:40 america or sorry african-american right
94:43 by the way there's a native american
94:45 comedian out there now
94:46 who's making making a little career for
94:49 himself i mean i just saw the guy for
94:50 the first time i don't know if he's been
94:51 around forever
94:52 and he said he goes he goes you know
94:55 they want us to call each other native
94:56 americans and he goes like i'm still
94:58 going with indian who's
95:00 what i grew up with and it's easier to
95:02 say
95:03 and you know it's not
95:07 african american lives matter it's black
95:09 lives matter
95:11 it just goes but how is that okay and
95:13 then like 20 years ago when uh
95:16 you know everything was different it was
95:18 bad and then it's just like come on you
95:20 can't win those games
95:22 there are some things that are
95:23 absolutely unfounded or absolutely
95:26 rooted in things that you would never
95:28 ever
95:30 say today like no matter what doesn't
95:32 said in a hundred years i said yeah we
95:34 should probably retire a few things
95:35 right
95:37 but in closing
95:41 we are at a new frontier
95:45 of how the hell do we continue to exist
95:47 on the internet
95:48 in this world within i should say
95:53 knowing that all of the media lies
95:57 all of it project mockingbird
96:00 i skipped over it but most of you know
96:03 they created an agency
96:05 in the mid 50s in america under the
96:06 cia's guise to
96:08 infiltrate all of the press of the world
96:10 and come on hearst was doing it back in
96:11 the 1800s right
96:13 pay me to write whatever you want to
96:15 hear
96:17 and i'll just take your money now it's
96:21 a hundred percent local news
96:24 100 local newspapers in little tiny
96:27 towns
96:28 100 it's all fake it's all crap
96:32 it's all slanted i mean your kid could
96:34 be on a
96:36 your kid could be on a swing set and the
96:38 local newspaper takes a picture of your
96:39 kid on the swing set
96:40 whatever they say has been twisted
96:42 somehow right racist girl
96:44 pushes faster than black or girl black
96:45 girl i mean it could just be just
96:47 nuts just to create some hatred
96:52 and the funny thing is is or the ironic
96:54 thing is is that they just laugh
96:56 all the way to the bank every single
96:58 time
96:59 you know the drudge report what a piece
97:02 of [ __ ] rag that was
97:04 it's still up there but i just can't
97:06 can't get into it he's an
97:07 aggregator of hate he's an
97:10 aggregator of instigating people hating
97:13 each other
97:14 the dude literally i don't know if it's
97:16 one guy so i wanted it's always on a
97:18 picture but that dude
97:19 in my opinion is like
97:22 the devil in needful things
97:26 i'm just going to get you to think about
97:27 this one thing and that'll get you to
97:28 kill your neighbor
97:29 i'm going to get you this and it'll spit
97:31 in his face then you'll burn down your
97:32 neighbor's house
97:33 he just plays with negativity trying to
97:36 kill the world
97:37 and he's making money off of it right
97:40 they're all fake man breitbart
97:41 all of it and i don't care if you've
97:43 heard one person say something great
97:45 like i've said a couple times that like
97:47 hannity said some things i mean hannity
97:49 was a guy that
97:50 kept 911 concealed
97:54 right he's the one that went after uh
97:57 what is it uh stephen steve jones the
98:00 professor from
98:01 brigham and university was telling you
98:02 it was was a
98:05 inside job and then hannity shot him
98:08 down so hannity was the total insider
98:10 deep stater guy well now he's
98:11 what he's [ __ ] paul now in the bible
98:13 all of a sudden he was a serial
98:14 masculine christians and saul and he saw
98:16 god and now he's better
98:19 tucker carlson he's pretty he's pretty
98:21 consistent i don't know if they keep him
98:22 around as an anchor to make sure
98:23 everybody goes
98:24 goes well geraldo rivera was totally pro
98:28 911 not an inside job
98:31 yelled at everybody who knew science
98:33 just like the mask thing
98:34 right everybody knows the science of
98:36 nucleic acid chains we're all [ __ ]
98:40 just because you have mob rules
98:43 you're right dude
98:48 mob rules became a cliche because it
98:51 became
98:53 it has become and will become again
98:57 the reason why you die on a guillotine
99:02 trying to kill 40 million people in the
99:04 19th century because of mob rules
99:07 you don't want to do that again right
99:11 then you have inquisition kind of mob
99:12 rules which is nobody really agrees with
99:14 what's going on but everybody's so
99:15 terrified
99:17 they're willing to go along with turning
99:19 in their neighbors until they're all
99:20 gone
99:23 some big decisions need to be made but
99:26 i'm telling you right now if you're
99:27 drunk
99:28 but you're not if you're new to the
99:31 channel you're drunk
99:32 and you think that there's a big cabal
99:34 for the pedophiles to succeed

99:40 because uh
99:42 you're gonna have your cap peeled so
99:43 intensely you won't know what to do with
99:45 the rest of your brain
99:48 because we're gonna wake you up you know
99:50 it's gonna be insane
99:52 and you know if they try to pull
99:54 something like a 911
99:55 prior to um november which
99:59 you know that's why trump can't sit
100:02 around just sitting there waiting for
100:03 arrests trump has to do it now
100:05 he has to before they pull their cabal
100:08 believe me when he
