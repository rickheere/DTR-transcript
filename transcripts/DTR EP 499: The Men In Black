00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentlemen today I have the distinct
00:35 pleasure of recording this episode
00:38 because power had failed in my pipeline
00:44 and I didn't do a Mic Check like a
00:45 complete idiot it was like one of the
00:47 only times my old life I didn't do my
00:48 check and of course but as always it's
00:53 always better the second time but it was
00:55 two and a half hours of what I think was
00:57 a pretty good episode so here we go
00:59 men in black once again for me yeah so
01:07 men in black it's a phenomenon that
01:11 emerged out of the 20th century and
01:14 there's gonna be a few interesting
01:17 little things about the emergence of
01:19 this it has been obviously romanticized
01:22 in tons of movies if you've ever seen
01:26 the television show fringe you will have
01:28 seen probably one of the most brilliant
01:31 interpretations of the men in black ever
01:34 I can assure you that the gentleman who
01:38 wrote that show definitely is heard
01:40 every story I'm about to tell you and
01:44 coincidentally the very first reported
01:46 sighting of this and I'm sure there's
01:48 others and if you listen to certain
01:50 people they try to equate this back to
01:53 every time three guys show up to a place
01:55 it's the legacy men and black kind of
01:59 thing it's kind of funny but typically
02:03 the archetype of this is that you have
02:04 either seen a UFO or you are
02:07 investigating UFO and very shortly after
02:09 that even though the event is very
02:11 private to you these people show up and
02:14 they try to ask you what's going on now
02:17 their objectives with humanity whether
02:20 these be other humans or something else
02:23 there's a pivotal change which we're
02:26 gonna get to in the sightings of these
02:28 men and black which is very interesting
02:31 because every hoax tends to evolve its
02:35 narrative remember you know those little
02:37 green men from outer space and then
02:39 eventually it kind of got into garble
02:41 goopy things and ended up being grey
02:44 aliens than it was reptilians then it
02:46 will actually 70s it was the Raelians
02:48 that look like us but kind of elvish so
02:51 you know people pick up people who are
02:53 scammers and charlatans pick up the
02:54 story from someone else and embellish it
02:56 and then the next person has to keep all
02:58 those embellishments because that's the
02:59 way the story goes and keeps moving it
03:01 up it's very interesting but the typical
03:05 archetype is that these men in black
03:08 initially at least were saying you
03:10 didn't see what you saw and that's
03:12 usually their mo
03:15 now we're gonna loop back because we are
03:17 going to get into what these folks might
03:21 be but the very first sighting we're
03:25 gonna loop around just a little bit is
03:28 1947 and Puget Sound in Washington State
03:31 in America it's all his America folks
03:34 sorry as if there's one in England sort
03:37 of I guess no it's pretty legit England
03:40 one but most of happen America at least
03:42 and I want you to report in other
03:45 sightings but you have to understand I
03:46 mean I went all over the web reading
03:49 articles downloading special PDFs
03:51 looking at video should I got a hair in
03:55 my mouth and it's pretty much the same
03:59 story but now this murray island event
04:02 murray island holds Puget Sound such a
04:06 cool name rate it's a bay with you know
04:10 boats and people out there and this
04:12 happens from what I can tell just about
04:15 a week or two before
04:17 Roswell's crash in New Mexico but I want
04:22 you to have this following fact in your
04:24 mind but as we go through this entire
04:29 episode which is that in 1938 Orson
04:33 Welles broadcasts War of the Worlds
04:37 which I believe is the HG Welles story
04:40 right watch that become horribly wrong
04:44 he broadcast it in such a way in New
04:46 York City that everyone thought that it
04:52 was real now Orson Welles was a prodigy
04:56 and everything he touched
04:58 including a bowl of spaghetti and he was
05:01 just renowned as one of the greatest
05:03 filmmakers ever and so the military gets
05:08 to see this they get to see this amazing
05:09 panic and it could be weaponized and so
05:15 some of these events that are gonna be
05:17 there and our stories here could be
05:19 testing the thresholds of a PSYOP and
05:22 then attempting to control it through a
05:26 staff of individuals to show up
05:28 if there is evidence to suggest and
05:32 we'll have to suspend our disbelief
05:35 maybe that there is something real to
05:39 these beings and again on this show it's
05:42 not about how smart we are by pissing on
05:45 everything it's really applying logic
05:48 and going on you know maybe maybe
05:49 they're at this Flesch and I don't know
05:50 I've been in space but it's June of 1947
05:55 and I will tell you this with all of
06:00 these stories I'm about to tell you
06:01 there's a sort of a Matthew Mark Luke
06:03 John version of the narration of any one
06:05 of these stories meaning you will see a
06:08 movie and it will tell you one thing
06:11 you'll see a you'll read an article you
06:15 read a book and they're different all
06:17 these little things are different but
06:18 they don't necessarily contradict each
06:19 other they just simply add more details
06:21 to what the hell is going on so
06:23 hopefully the value of this video for
06:24 you especially if you like this content
06:26 is gonna be a lot of pictures will be
06:28 that I have harvested every single claim
06:33 for each one of these stories and I
06:35 apologize if in some of these there's
06:38 there are limits to what I have read
06:40 some of them we have I have a PDF
06:43 written by one of the eyewitnesses who
06:45 was the guy who was visited and he just
06:47 simply did an autobiography moment of
06:50 the event now there may be just so you
06:54 know the Murray Island incident is
06:55 fascinating because it was witnessed by
06:57 several people when you do hear the
07:00 abbreviated abridged versions of this
07:03 story you do not get the sense that
07:04 there's multiple people and so just know
07:09 you have a bay fusion sound and it's
07:13 kind of like a collection of islands you
07:17 have to like security guys on a ship you
07:21 have a guy fishing with his dog and his
07:24 son and we have to assume that there was
07:28 other people that saw this that simply
07:30 didn't come forward didn't seem to have
07:32 this issue but in broad daylight
07:35 you have six
07:37 round UFO like saucers except they're
07:41 doughnut-shaped very sophisticated it's
07:44 not necessarily forgot what they call
07:46 the donut shape but it's not just a pure
07:48 donut shape it's got a lot of you know
07:50 different curves and edges on it but
07:52 just simply had a hole through the
07:53 center and it involves a guy named
07:56 Howard dowel da HL he counted six of
08:01 these things now the story is very on
08:04 exactly how this mishap occurs Dowell
08:08 said he goes you know I turned around I
08:10 looked at these things and of course
08:12 they're unbelievable he said from the
08:16 center of this donut hole according to
08:19 him he said it looked like they were
08:21 dropping one of these ships was dropping
08:23 like a lava metal into the lake or the
08:27 ocean or what have you and then it sort
08:30 of started looking more silvery so I
08:32 went from kind of a fire color to a
08:33 silver color and in doing this there was
08:38 I guess two of them doing it and one of
08:40 the refinements of the story and they
08:42 have to tip to do this I don't know why
08:44 but in the tipping process they banged
08:46 into each other and so this causes an
08:50 accident one of them is said to utterly
08:53 explode another one was that it simply
08:58 just dripped this stuff on on folks with
09:01 causing the damage I'm about to outline
09:03 here and then flew off because a ship
09:05 exploding you would think would leave
09:07 massive debris a hole of a ship a
09:10 cockpit alien bodies that kind of thing
09:13 so I tend to believe if this ever really
09:15 truly happened that it was simply the
09:19 stuff coming out but Howard or Harold
09:23 excuse me
09:24 his dog gets killed by this explosion
09:29 now it could be explosion of like
09:31 crossing the beams and ghostbusters
09:33 right the lava touches other people's
09:35 love or whatever who knows but his dog
09:38 dies one of the videos I saw showed a
09:42 picture of a dog but it didn't look like
09:45 an official picture of a dog like his
09:47 dog but his son was injured a lot of the
09:50 stories don't tell you
09:51 what the injury was another version of
09:54 it said that the metal got on you know
09:57 touched his son for a split second and
09:59 burned him now most of us know you know
10:04 you can take a foundry steel that's
10:05 coming out of a foundry and it's like
10:07 several thousand degrees molten metal
10:10 and you could flick it with your finger
10:11 really really fast
10:13 and you won't burn yourself and I won't
10:15 stick to you maybe it's one of those
10:17 situations but you would think that if
10:20 it got on you you'd be really really
10:22 badly injured he ends up taking his son
10:27 to the hospital and then the second
10:29 story comes up where the two security
10:32 guards were immediately approached by
10:35 three men in black told they'd ever saw
10:38 anything and that they one of the
10:41 stories I heard was that they were told
10:42 it was a weather balloon isn't that
10:45 interesting six flying saucers
10:47 doughnut-shaped has nothing to do with
10:48 the weather balloon design rate a third
10:51 source which corroborates this sighting
10:55 was that a pilot happened to be in the
10:57 area and claims that he saw the donuts
11:00 so that's pretty cool so Harold takes
11:05 his son to the hospital gets that taken
11:07 care of
11:08 says he comes back finds a piece of the
11:11 metal on the ground there's a picture of
11:14 it yeah I believe it's his piece of
11:18 metal metal and there's gonna be another
11:21 story where there's a piece and I have
11:23 to make sure the photo I have is of the
11:24 first one he also said that he saw the
11:29 ship's again and got a camera out and
11:32 started taking pictures unfortunately
11:34 for him the pictures apparently come
11:35 back with black spots on them I could
11:37 not find them I will do a deeper dive on
11:39 those photos so this is where it gets
11:42 interesting because the the minim black
11:45 sighting for Harold goes over to these
11:48 other security guards where they were
11:49 told it was weather blue the FBI gets
11:52 interested in this story and visits
11:54 Harold and his other buddy Chris Crispin
11:59 and starts asking them questions which
12:03 you know sort of gains a little validity
12:06 when the FBI wants to ask you questions
12:08 because you would think that they would
12:09 know what was a airforce operation
12:15 versus something else but they really
12:17 are asking him a ton of questions again
12:20 they could just be trying to gather what
12:21 he was able to discern from the event
12:23 now in addition after the FBI is done
12:26 the Air Force sends over two pilots I
12:29 guess our investigators to talk to
12:30 Harold and his buddy they get copies of
12:33 the photographs and they get supposedly
12:36 some copies of the steal because it's
12:38 just like a Roswell thing lots of little
12:40 pieces you can have that piece you know
12:42 on their flight back home
12:44 I'm not sure where they came from their
12:47 plane crashes and the two Air Force
12:49 investigators die with the photographs
12:51 done with the medal
12:53 it could be that they were lifted out of
12:56 the official timeline of us and they
13:02 were put in some Q clearance thing this
13:04 this has been known to occur people who
13:06 see things or you know evaporated out of
13:08 society and then they say they died but
13:10 they didn't who knows and then a lot of
13:15 pressure comes down on Harald because he
13:16 said look at those two guys died
13:17 investigating your phony story and so
13:22 one of the epitaphs of this story was
13:24 that Harald claimed later that it was a
13:27 hoax the truth of the matter from what
13:30 I've been able to discover is that
13:32 nothing of the sort actually occurred
13:35 but within the FBI files of Harald he
13:40 said that you know you know what
13:43 happened I told you what happened I told
13:45 the airforce dudes would happen and
13:46 here's what I'm gonna do if the press or
13:48 anyone else comes to me I will just
13:50 simply tell them it's a hoax and you'll
13:52 be the only ones that I talk to
13:54 so that was documented in the FBI files
13:57 so it's good
14:00 but murray island thing has a huge story
14:04 to it and in fact there's a journalism
14:06 video about the murray starts with the
14:08 murray Island incident in 47 June and
14:12 goes all the way up to Kennedy's
14:13 assassination
14:14 it goes into a bunch of secret societies
14:17 and Mason groups in New York it links to
14:21 the moon I mean it was a pretty amazing
14:23 video if any of you seen that please
14:25 link it to me because I can't get jaren
14:28 ISM to reply to anything if you guys
14:29 know how to talk to that guy just send
14:31 me as email and I'll make it happen next
14:34 sighting actually has two different
14:35 years in the research that I've done but
14:38 it's fairly close it's either 1953 1955
14:42 my initial research said 53 and an
14:44 article I read said 55 yeah this guy's
14:48 name's Albert Kate bender and he was a
14:52 sci-fi writer he was interested in
14:57 obviously UFO research and you know this
15:00 is this is the early 50s Roswell
15:03 supposedly had just occurred but he
15:04 published a periodical called space
15:07 review which I guess just was a mishmash
15:10 of all kinds of different interesting
15:11 stuff and on a particular occasion three
15:15 men in black visit him and essentially
15:21 threatened him that if he doesn't cease
15:23 his research because what had happened
15:24 was he had created this space review
15:26 periodical and then just kept getting
15:31 approached by people because the the
15:33 space theme of his document and so they
15:36 came to him and you know and give more
15:38 information you just started becoming
15:39 sort of an Oracle remember there's no
15:41 web at the moment and so once you get
15:44 known in public you can get a thousand
15:46 letters a month and you'll know a lot
15:48 more than most people so apparently
15:51 these three men and black no physical
15:53 description of these guys whatsoever
15:55 this is his place and threatened him
15:59 with prison time if he continues to
16:02 publish his periodical or really talk to
16:07 anyone else about what it was been going
16:09 on they freaked him out so bad that
16:12 immediately
16:13 and gets rid of his space review totally
16:16 successful document you know that he
16:18 publishes and if any one of you were
16:21 capable of coming up with a periodical
16:25 I guess it'd be like someone coming up
16:27 to me and midseason threatening me that
16:30 if I do any more shows they're gonna
16:31 kill me or whatever and then you just
16:33 see this show disappear in the middle of
16:35 nowhere you know I don't try to get it
16:37 going or anything I'm a healthy guy and
16:38 all this other stuff so the only real
16:43 takeaway we have from the men and black
16:45 in this particular scenario is that they
16:48 that the Albert guy would get headaches
16:51 when he was around them and he said that
16:54 afterwards they would call him and he
17:00 like he purported a phone call where he
17:02 was on the phone no it seemed like
17:04 someone was on other side but they
17:05 didn't talk and he was getting a
17:07 headache during this conversation that
17:10 was not occurring so it could be that
17:13 he's just stressful and he gets
17:16 headaches but I'm just giving you all of
17:19 them that I hear because you're gonna
17:20 see this evolve slowly over time the
17:24 next ones in 1961 with a guy named Paul
17:26 Miller Paul Miller and a couple buddies
17:30 are coming home from what one report
17:33 says is a camping trip and so they're
17:35 armed because they have their camping
17:38 gear for whatever reason they have
17:40 parked actually started there they're
17:43 coming home they're just really just a
17:45 couple miles from his house and as it's
17:49 reported
17:51 all three of them should have seen this
17:53 but Paul they say basically Paul saw a
17:56 light cylinder land in the forest very
18:01 close to them or I shouldn't yeah he
18:05 said silo so it's mind-blowing right to
18:09 see something land so he gets out of the
18:12 car goes over to it has his gun with him
18:16 says the two beings come out of this
18:18 thing he shoots one of them and just
18:22 gets absolutely freaked out that they
18:24 actually just run off so now the guys
18:28 are freaked out and what's not clear is
18:32 there's no physical description of the
18:33 silo after it lands like wouldn't it be
18:36 nice to know that it stayed lit that it
18:37 was a just
18:39 fire coming out of a silo looking thing
18:41 like a like some of those UFOs that we
18:43 see their silos I'll be putting some
18:45 photos up here so the three guys now are
18:50 trekking back to his house and again I
18:54 don't know why they wouldn't just get
18:55 back in a car you know some of these
18:57 stories are just kind of hokey little
18:59 things but they report losing two to
19:02 three hours worth of their life on what
19:05 should be just about a 15 minute walk
19:08 very whitley strieber
19:10 but this is 1961 so the very next day
19:14 because they just go to bed right the
19:15 very next day they get up I guess his
19:18 buddies left and there's a three men in
19:22 black who have the the knock on the door
19:28 they forced their way inside of his home
19:31 slash office and the number one thing
19:36 they want to do is inspect his clothes
19:38 he's cool he's like yeah sure expect my
19:41 clothes no problem here and then they
19:44 started talking about this the sighting
19:47 that he saw and so he's like well I
19:51 didn't tell anybody yet it just happened
19:53 how the hell these guys know you know
19:56 they also flashed this badge which is
19:59 where we get the first and mut to my
20:02 knowledge the first version of this
20:03 badge which is it's sort of like the
20:08 Doctor Who badge you know it just shows
20:11 a white piece of paper and everyone sees
20:12 what they need to see to authorize
20:14 whatever is going to happen next but
20:17 this badge
20:18 supposing is a crest on it no one knows
20:20 exactly what it looks like but it has
20:22 the big word security on it now that by
20:25 itself would be laughable I think to
20:27 even someone in 1961 you would think it
20:30 would have person's face on it some name
20:33 or something like that but apparently
20:35 this badge is just as generic as it
20:36 could possibly be but these big guys are
20:40 pretty formidable it's the thing they
20:43 told him quote things are best left in
20:48 the dark
20:51 historian's there nothing else happens
20:54 the next one is that there is one in
20:59 1963 but it's just so bad I'm not gonna
21:01 go there but 64 we have the very famous
21:05 Solway Firth spaceman photo and I'm not
21:10 from England but I guess it's a location
21:12 in England
21:13 this 1964 it's summer and this dude is
21:19 taking a picture of his daughter his
21:21 name is Jim Templeton I'm right probably
21:24 several have you've seen this photograph
21:26 but it says just this little girl
21:27 sitting on a grassy knoll or whatever
21:30 and but behind her is an odd character
21:34 over her head which people immediately
21:37 jumped to conclusion it's a spaceman now
21:41 I'll just jump to the the cynical part
21:44 of the review is that this was his wife
21:47 that managed just to step into the shot
21:49 now I tried to find other photographs
21:52 from this day I did find one his wife
21:55 apparently is wearing kind of a long
21:57 skirt dress thing like um kind of like
22:03 an Oklahoma dress you know but she has a
22:05 white blouse on and just you can see her
22:08 falling off the shot she's totally cut
22:10 off the shot on the right side the
22:13 person behind the kid definitely has a
22:15 white top on but the head doesn't appear
22:18 to have a female hairdo unless this
22:20 mother has a very very short hairdo so I
22:25 guess you know the photo comes in he
22:27 analyzes these I go my god that's weird
22:29 it gets published in the newspapers very
22:34 soon after that two men in black visit
22:36 his home when asked hey who are you they
22:41 said well we're government officials and
22:43 we simply refer to ourselves as nine and
22:46 ten very bored is right so what they do
22:53 is they say you mind taking us to where
22:55 you took this photograph he's like yeah
22:57 sure it's just down the street they hop
22:59 in the car broad daylight they go to the
23:01 location he gets out and they're asking
23:04 them all
23:04 different questions about the weather
23:05 you know what did he what was he wearing
23:08 that day what did he you know every
23:10 little miniscule detail and they only
23:12 said they finally asked him what what
23:16 did this guy look like when you saw him
23:17 and he's like I didn't see him that's
23:19 the point I took this photograph it was
23:21 just in my photograph and to get
23:23 apparently get really angry drive off he
23:26 never sees him again okay so this
23:32 photographs traveling the world takes a
23:34 little while right if I makes it to this
23:37 is an England and it finally makes it to
23:41 Australia and there's a nuclear missile
23:46 silo in Australia and they found
23:52 something very interesting in their
23:53 surveillance footage they call up this
23:56 tip Alton dude and they say hey mind if
23:58 we ask you some questions because we
24:01 have in our surveillance cameras two
24:04 people that look very much like your
24:07 spaceman there you go
24:09 that's weird and then they tell him the
24:12 other thing that's kind of strange is is
24:14 is the missiles that we have in our
24:16 silos were actually built less than 20
24:19 miles from where you live almost like
24:23 they're sort of just assuring in this
24:25 this stuff now it would have been nice
24:27 to compare some dates why on earth would
24:29 they be there 20 miles away is a long
24:31 ways away you would imagine if it was
24:34 like right next door then there's a
24:36 reason but they said that several of
24:39 their tests had been scrapped on the
24:42 days that the spaceman happened to be
24:45 visible in the surveillance footage I
24:47 was not able to find any of the spaceman
24:49 surveillance footage from Australia so
24:53 maybe it's his wife we need to have more
24:55 photographs of his wife because again
24:58 the the head just kind of looks like a
25:01 helmet it's really really strange
25:04 okay so 1967 now and we're in Toledo
25:10 Ohio and a guy named Robert Richardson
25:12 is driving his car home and he says that
25:16 when he's driving home up over the hill
25:21 side of where he's driving a flying
25:24 saucer comes right on his car like it's
25:27 hugging the ground a little too tight
25:28 and it pulls up at the last second and
25:30 slams into his car and we have to
25:33 remember he's driving an older car
25:35 they're made like tanks you know so they
25:37 can take a pretty good impact not like
25:39 today's cars right and this impact
25:44 knocks a piece of metal off of the ship
25:46 which he then fetches being a fairly
25:50 smart person he sends it to the aerial
25:53 phenomenon research organization or a
25:55 pro for analysis while the medals gone
26:00 he gets visited by a minim a man in
26:04 black who drives in what he claims to be
26:07 a 53 caddy
26:08 now the question still remains
26:11 because again nobody ever asked any
26:13 details or if they get the details they
26:15 don't they don't ask the follow-up
26:17 questions to really lock down how this
26:19 found out because there's a little bit
26:20 there's a little chatzky about the car
26:22 but they said the guy was wearing you
26:25 know a hat and glasses the fedora that
26:28 he behaved very friendly questioned him
26:32 for about 10 minutes and in this
26:34 particular case I found my notes weren't
26:36 very good
26:37 there's too many black both of them have
26:40 kind of an odd olive-skinned one speaks
26:43 in a perfect English accent and the
26:46 other one has seems to have a foreign
26:48 accent they told him that he didn't have
26:51 an accident and they wanted the medal
26:54 and he's like why don't have the medal
26:57 and so they threatened him with his
27:01 wife's safety they essentially said if
27:03 you like the way your wife's face looks
27:05 you know you better cough up this medal
27:09 he said the car had unregistered plates
27:12 and when he visited a cadillac
27:14 dealership that he was not able to find
27:16 a 53 caddy that looked any
27:18 like the cards that they showed up with
27:21 he never heard from the men in black
27:23 again and what's interesting is when the
27:25 metal came back from a pro they said it
27:28 you don't tested negative for anything
27:30 abnormal
27:32 what is unclear is whether or not he got
27:35 the metal back because that's a huge
27:38 deal any metal from one of the planets
27:41 going to register with a different
27:42 frequency and thus we can determine it's
27:45 from another planet now the next one
27:49 happens in 1968 and I could not find
27:54 what the hell this guy had done had he
27:56 seen a UFO or what have you
27:57 I'll put some text plate updates on top
28:01 of the video if I can determine what it
28:04 was they got this guy visited by a man
28:06 black this guy's in New Jersey and his
28:10 claim was that there was a man in black
28:13 across the street watching his apartment
28:15 the whole time so he calls his buddy
28:18 Timothy green Beckley to go out and take
28:21 a photograph without the guy knowing and
28:22 they get a photograph of this guy very
28:25 unremarkable he must have done something
28:28 they get the photograph and then their
28:33 opinion was that their location in their
28:35 home was getting you know turned over a
28:39 little bit people were coming in and
28:40 looking at things was their impression
28:43 so move up to 1976 and something very
28:47 interesting occurs with a guy named dr.
28:50 Herbert Hopkins now I had to read about
28:55 three different versions of the story to
28:56 get really who this dr. Hopkins is right
28:59 but he was a consultant on a UFO case in
29:05 particular and he performed the function
29:07 of hypnotist and we know that a lot of I
29:12 believe I talked about this guy in a
29:15 previous video many many hundreds of
29:18 videos ago but this happens on September
29:21 11th as a matter of fact
29:23 and he's just he hasn't personally seen
29:26 anything he's just researching this
29:28 project and a few others right so he
29:31 gets a phone call from a guy claiming to
29:33 be in from New Jersey and he's like I'm
29:37 from a youth organization you mind if I
29:39 come over we just chat a little bit this
29:42 is going to be one guy
29:43 it's okay sure great so you know gets up
29:47 the phone he starts kind of arranging
29:49 his home for a visitor flicks on the
29:50 front light and before he knows it
29:53 there's a guy walking up the steps of
29:56 his home now he's sitting there going
29:59 now wait a minute
30:01 this guy just called me like two minutes
30:04 ago
30:04 and now he's on my doorstep there is no
30:07 payphone anywhere near his home so
30:11 there's no way this guy could have done
30:11 a phone call unless somehow he had a tap
30:15 ended line on the outside of his house
30:17 or indeed he might have had he
30:19 military-grade cell phone way back in
30:22 the day or some satellite phone know
30:25 what's important about this story is
30:27 that this is where a tremendous
30:29 advancement in the biological
30:31 description and functionality of these
30:33 men in black occurs and from this point
30:36 four we're going to hear similar
30:38 upgrades to the story he said he had a
30:43 small nose a receded chin he said that
30:47 he had like almost plastic he kind of
30:50 skin no eyebrows no hair but he had like
30:54 rosy lips and I watched a video where a
30:58 guy really made a decent point he goes
31:00 wow they create this artificial human or
31:03 they this aliens trying to emulate
31:05 humanity gets the lipstick on the lips
31:08 but never figures out that maybe the
31:10 pair eyebrows might settle down they
31:12 visit a little bit right I have to agree
31:15 with him 100% this guy had a black shirt
31:18 black tie black suit as opposed to the
31:21 white tie the sort of you know the old
31:24 Blues Brothers outfit right so he comes
31:28 in and he's not really interested much
31:30 about the case he is continuing the
31:33 narrative destroy your files you need to
31:36 get out of this but
31:37 business it's dangerous for you and the
31:41 guys kind of you know alright you know
31:42 maybe he's got a nut bag on his case you
31:44 know and so at one point there's sort of
31:49 that moment where he's trying to
31:51 threaten him
31:53 and so he says you know you got two
31:56 coins in your pocket why don't you give
31:57 me one of them and of course he reaches
31:59 in his pocket he's got two coins I know
32:02 it's a little funky so he brings out a
32:04 brand-new copper penny and he goes watch
32:08 this and so the men in black man and
32:11 black guy puts it in his palm and the
32:13 way they tell the story is it went from
32:14 copper to silver and then glowed blue
32:19 and vanished out of his palm and then so
32:24 you see this he's just seeing this
32:26 miraculous thing and then he asks this
32:28 Hopkins guy do you remember the story of
32:30 Barney Hill and his wife and he's like
32:34 yeah yeah totally I remember the story
32:35 they saw UFO and all this other stuff
32:38 he was yep but didn't he die of a heart
32:40 attack this is not really what he really
32:42 died of is his heart was removed from
32:45 his body insinuating that the coin
32:48 technique was the method by which his
32:50 heart was removed dr. Hopkins claims
32:53 that he was motivated to start all his
32:56 files and then he said four months after
32:59 his phone in his home had tremendous
33:02 problems connecting he had the phone
33:05 company out supposedly the phone company
33:07 validates his claim and says you know
33:10 someone is definitely messing with your
33:12 phone it's not us we we don't have any
33:14 men and black kind of people and we
33:20 haven't had any maintenance in your area
33:21 so don't know what's going on here and
33:23 he hadn't seen any maintenance when this
33:26 dude left his house though he said that
33:29 he closed the door behind him
33:31 so he's out in the porch and instead of
33:34 like getting in a car or walking off
33:36 major flash of blue light and he was
33:40 simply gone and when he opens up the
33:42 door he says there was like tracks out
33:44 there as if there might have been a car
33:46 pick him up very very strange so now we
33:53 go up to 1979 and a guy named Paul
33:55 Frederick's jr. he had said that he had
33:59 seen some some vehicles in the sky and
34:02 after that
34:04 I consistently heard some really weird
34:07 noises in the sky and shortly after that
34:13 he contact his contacts the Air Force to
34:16 ask some questions about without their
34:17 do anything they flat-out tell him that
34:19 he's tracking test flights
34:24 right after he makes the phone call to
34:26 the air force two-minute black show up
34:28 and this is where the narrative changes
34:32 again now the minute black tell him you
34:36 should follow UFO sightings and they
34:40 proceeded to give him more and more
34:43 documentation getting him spread out you
34:46 know really thin on all of his
34:48 investigations and he eventually went
34:53 crazy died in 2002 was committed in a
34:56 mental institution supposedly and he
34:59 just rambled on about an alien invasion
35:01 that they had convinced him that all the
35:04 materials are really talking about an
35:06 alien invasion and he before he was
35:09 committed had told people look it was
35:10 the Air Force trying to discredit me
35:12 from what I saw you know what doesn't
35:17 make any sense to me is that and this
35:19 are just experimenting with the human
35:22 psyche experimenting with what perhaps
35:25 they're capable of doing to another
35:26 human being
35:27 destroying their lives right but if he
35:32 doesn't you know if he just sees
35:34 something and hear or something it's not
35:37 like it was like it's gonna change the
35:39 game for the government raised I saw the
35:41 sr-71 whoop-dee-doo you know it doesn't
35:44 tell the Russians anything the Russians
35:46 are gonna see something or who our enemy
35:48 is in their minds right but this
35:51 particular story does not come with any
35:52 major refinements or even call-outs to
35:55 what the man in black actually look like
35:58 fast forward in 1982 the University of
36:02 Pennsylvania that Professor Peter and I
36:04 cannot say this last name is saved my
36:06 soul its roj c e wi c z poof let's call
36:12 him professor he is sitting in the
36:15 university library after having a book
36:18 recommended to him by a friend regarding
36:21 UFOs as he's reading it he takes
36:25 inventory of the room there's two people
36:27 in the room a girl over here a guy over
36:29 there and of course the people putting
36:31 back books and running the library off
36:33 camera right
36:35 he says really without any visible you
36:40 know dude entering the room there's a
36:42 guy he was a man and black kind of guy
36:44 shows up right in front of him very
36:46 humanoid no problems no descriptions I
36:50 heard that what he was look strange but
36:52 he said he asked the guy he goes what
36:57 are you doing what are you written he's
36:59 like I'm reading a book about UFOs but
37:01 he kind of minimizes like you know I but
37:04 you know I'm just reading this buddy of
37:06 mine wanted me to read it and the guy
37:07 apparently and one version of the story
37:10 slams his hand down on the desk and
37:12 sitting at and says you know UFOs are
37:16 the most important find of human history
37:19 it's very important that you do that you
37:21 research this but don't minimize it
37:24 which took him off guard now he's kind a
37:27 crazy the guy notices that he's freaked
37:31 him out the men in black man in black
37:34 kind of guy puts his hand on his his
37:37 right shoulder and says be well on your
37:40 purpose
37:40 supposedly leaves the room so the dudes
37:45 counting oh that was really strange and
37:47 then he notices this is his story this
37:50 is when I has a PDF about his story it
37:56 says he said that the two people in the
38:01 room vanished and so then he was like oh
38:03 it's strange he gets up to just walk off
38:06 this event and realizes that there's no
38:08 one else in the library at all and it's
38:12 one of those uneasy moments where you
38:13 feel like well can I leave there's no
38:15 one here you know maybe I should stay
38:16 until someone comes back and then they
38:18 can lock the door or whatever so he sits
38:19 back down continues reading this book I
38:22 guess further energized by the
38:25 confrontation with this guy and an hour
38:29 later everyone fades back in the room
38:31 exactly where they were sitting
38:34 it's a story he's a professor now 1989
38:39 for those of you are real big buffs in
38:41 this
38:43 there's a guy named John keel and
38:45 there's a series of interviews with him
38:47 or his speeches online I could not
38:50 stomach this guy for more than one
38:52 five-minute 55 second interview he's a
38:57 very religious guy and what he's trying
38:59 to do is equate the men and black back
39:02 to every single time there's ever been a
39:04 surprise character show up to any event
39:08 but he kind of goes on a David Icke
39:11 track and I have more respect for David
39:14 than for John keel trust me but he
39:17 mentions this book this book in China
39:19 called the king of the world
39:22 it's a book that well it's a kind of a
39:27 old tale hatched out of Mongolia of all
39:30 places and they believe that there is an
39:32 inner earth and that there's this king
39:35 down there and that he will routinely
39:37 send up his minions to change the world
39:41 okay well you know the Sumerians talked
39:45 about the people out of the from the
39:47 hilltops coming down to reset Sumeria
39:50 getting rid of all the corruption
39:51 reappointing people and going back up
39:54 and this would happen every three to
39:56 five hundred years okay so like an old
40:00 tale rebranded for that area but the the
40:04 interesting story about this was that
40:06 according to the king of the world
40:09 storyline he doesn't always want to help
40:12 mankind he kind of messes everything up
40:15 at the same time he couldn't make things
40:17 better make things worse so he's a dick
40:20 basically so I'm reporting that from
40:24 1989 I absolutely had no interest in his
40:29 story whatsoever personally so then we
40:32 fast-forward up to 2002 with a very
40:35 interesting person named Dan Aykroyd and
40:38 I just want to say that the story of Dan
40:40 Aykroyd and his whole phenomenon
40:43 paranormal thing UFO thing I have
40:45 listened to so many interviews of him
40:48 being built up as this big you know
40:50 paranormal guy and then he's got nothing
40:52 to say
40:54 I mean like maybe you've seen a
40:56 interview I haven't seen but I have
40:58 never seen anything remarkable out of
41:00 Dan Aykroyd being a part of this family
41:03 that is just you know always been very
41:05 open mind I think it's fantastic
41:07 that his family's like that but the way
41:12 this story goes is he had he had gotten
41:15 a paranormal show greenlit which would
41:19 have been great to see and he's on
41:22 location about to shoot somewhere and he
41:23 gets a call and the calls from Britney
41:26 Spears and she's about to go on SNL
41:29 she's like I'd really like you to play
41:30 opposite me in this skit so he's outside
41:34 taking this phone call during the course
41:37 of the phone call he's pacing back and
41:40 forth outside as its told and this sedan
41:42 pulls up this black sedan pulls up and
41:44 this man and black man a black guy comes
41:47 out his describe is a little bit older
41:49 but he's scowling across the street
41:53 we're talking like you know country road
41:55 as I had described at Dan Aykroyd which
42:00 you know Dan's like famous and there's a
42:03 funny video out there where this foreign
42:05 kid god bless him he didn't know how to
42:07 say Aykroyd so he was saying the
42:09 funniest last name for Dan Aykroyd I've
42:11 ever seen in my life or heard but he
42:14 says he looks at the guy and of course
42:16 when someone's scowling at you you know
42:18 I'm sure Dan seen that before and in his
42:20 lifetime you kind of typically just
42:23 avert your eyes right immediately okay
42:26 I'm not gonna stare at this guy he'll
42:27 come over and sort of attacked me so as
42:30 he's pacing he just does a little loop
42:32 and by the time he turns around what he
42:35 said when we have to trust Dan's a
42:38 brilliant guy but he said this car was
42:42 gone and the dude was gone didn't hear
42:44 the engine turn on didn't have the time
42:46 that would normally take to have the car
42:49 drive of you know the shot basically
42:51 right he's not filming but I'm just
42:53 using film metaphor so he ends a phone
42:58 call with Spears the dude is gone and
43:01 within a couple hours he gets a phone
43:04 call and his show is cancelled
43:08 odd now what I was not able to discover
43:12 I mean there's a Wikipedia entry about
43:14 this event with dan Aykroyd what I'm
43:16 unable to figure out is what was the
43:18 case he was working on what was the
43:20 caseload of the first episode what what
43:23 materials had he perhaps covered in
43:24 previous episodes that might have got
43:26 him in this trouble with some agency of
43:30 some sort right I couldn't find anything
43:33 now we fast forward up to 2008
43:36 just outside Niagara Falls and this is
43:38 the coolest one of them all which is
43:40 awesome because I get to end on a really
43:41 good one I'm gonna talk about some other
43:43 stuff a guy named Shane so far and
43:52 October 14th night 2008 excuse me he and
43:57 two other guys said they saw a
43:59 triangular spaceship over the hotel a
44:02 little bit later they see a vehicle much
44:05 higher same configuration now what's
44:08 interesting is is most the time the
44:09 triangular thing is viewed used to be
44:12 associated with project Aurora which is
44:15 a Mach 13 supposed replacement for the
44:17 sr-71 it hovering over a hotel and Agra
44:21 makes no sense that would be more UFO so
44:24 what I'm trying to say he said there was
44:26 a big white light in towards the front
44:28 of the vehicle and then a red light
44:30 towards the back now every time we see
44:33 this thing it has three lights on each
44:35 corner right the cool thing about this
44:39 event is that a few days later if not
44:43 the day after they're not really clear
44:45 about that two men in black walk into
44:48 this hotel asking for Shane and this
44:51 thing got on surveillance footage so we
44:53 actually have the dudes walking into the
44:56 hotel I'm gonna put it video in there
44:59 hopefully we don't get nailed by some
45:00 copyright now it's interesting being an
45:03 artist and having to always my whole
45:06 life have to measure you know the amount
45:08 of heads to a body their heads look
45:11 small for the super big body now they
45:14 could have been wearing some protective
45:17 gear underneath obviously if they have
45:19 an overcoat on top of the suit
45:21 you get really large really quickly but
45:23 these these heads look a little strange
45:25 because there was an individual that
45:27 walked out I believe to a mailbox prior
45:30 to them walking in and that person looks
45:32 normal but the the men come up to the
45:41 desk and there's several people at the
45:44 desk now what is really strange is that
45:47 typically surveillance cameras are over
45:50 cash registers all the time right that's
45:53 where someone steals a little money on
45:54 the cast or just earned you want to know
45:56 you want to know what's happening at the
45:57 front door if you had to make a pick if
45:59 you had to choose the camera over the
46:02 register would be more important so it
46:05 not the story having no surveillance
46:07 over the register for me it's kind of
46:10 little wonky it's kind of convenient if
46:13 you will but there was a woman who was
46:18 was the main person that talked to them
46:20 you know like where is this person you
46:22 know Shane you want to talk to him the
46:25 woman said that the two guys look like
46:27 twins like mata goseck twins however
46:30 their skin didn't look real they had no
46:32 eyebrows they had hair but it looked
46:35 like in her opinion because they're so
46:38 identical between the two that look like
46:40 hair it was kind of plasticky and it was
46:43 attached to that hat well those kind of
46:46 things she also said that they had huge
46:49 blue eyes like bigger than normal she
46:54 got extremely freaked out by these guys
46:58 she also said they didn't blink which
47:01 was interesting so they come in now the
47:08 when I heard the story back towards the
47:10 the event like around 2010 what I heard
47:13 was that they they came back a few times
47:16 I just got more and more angry as they
47:18 came in so I wasn't able to cooperate
47:20 that in my recent research but then
47:22 again it looks like all these stories
47:23 have been heavily abbreviated since I
47:26 initially heard some of them
47:29 she also thought that they behaved as if
47:33 they could read her mind and very
47:35 distinctly they would ask her a question
47:37 she would think of the answer in her
47:40 mind they made facial expressions that
47:42 would be the response of the answer she
47:46 then would speak and they were already
47:48 on to the next question so those are the
47:53 sightings and now we can go into some of
47:57 the sort of post analysis and then I
47:59 want to sort of go over Close Encounters
48:04 the fifth kind a little bit which is the
48:07 new Steven Greer movie dr. Steven Greer
48:10 movie now it should be noted that
48:14 someone somewhere hatched a story that
48:18 these men and black folks are what they
48:20 call the tall whites and the tall whites
48:22 are an alien species that supposedly
48:25 lives on the moon now again the weird
48:32 cat and mouse game of the men in black
48:36 has to be kind of adjusted in the mind
48:39 to say okay why on earth would
48:41 SuperDuper informed people be constantly
48:43 harassing humans if not to do the please
48:47 destroy all your stuff and but there
48:49 because asking and asking someone to
48:51 destroy the materials I'm sure that's
48:56 very effective but you also risk
48:58 exposure of yourself right right now one
49:03 thing I want to put in your mind is that
49:05 what if these aliens are plentiful
49:10 multiple species and they are
49:12 essentially now saying because the
49:14 nuclear bomb goes off or some other
49:16 thing that it's just time to start
49:19 visiting earth and it's time to start
49:21 figuring out the plan of integration
49:23 with the rest of the species in the
49:25 universe / galaxies or whatever so if
49:29 you had a craft land in your backyard
49:31 and an alien comes out and talks to you
49:33 a couple things could be true right away
49:37 which first and foremost you could be
49:40 meeting as species that no one's ever
49:42 met before
49:43 you could be meaning as species that
49:44 they know about but have had very little
49:48 communication with you can be meaning
49:50 species they know extremely well and
49:52 talk to a lot but they want to know why
49:53 the help they talk to you but imagine
49:56 finding you know communication with one
49:59 of these species and no one's ever
50:01 communicated with and so in an instant
50:03 in your backyard with the five to ten
50:05 minute conversation hopefully you'll
50:07 have a longer conversations very
50:09 productive but you could know something
50:11 really really quickly that the
50:14 government doesn't know even really
50:16 class doesn't know their richest person
50:18 in the world doesn't know what you just
50:19 learned could be nothing could be
50:22 something so then following up and
50:25 saying okay what did they tell you what
50:26 did they tell you what did they tell you
50:26 you know that you could have the trump
50:30 card for a little while get at the upper
50:32 hand right now consequently the project
50:36 Bluebook out of all of its documentation
50:39 there was a claim that project Bluebook
50:42 did have a ongoing investigation about
50:46 people and personating government
50:48 officials in this men and black sort of
50:54 motif so imagine that is a reality where
50:59 the government's like oh my god you know
51:01 we're getting people are talking to our
51:03 people and they're they're passing as
51:05 human but they're poorly passing for
51:07 human so when you don't have control
51:11 then you're terrified right when the
51:13 government is always trying to get you
51:15 to believe that there's no one else
51:17 other than them to rule you and to
51:20 they've got it always under control
51:21 it's always that way so you could be
51:24 told it's a government vehicle instead
51:27 of a UFO so that you feel special you
51:30 know you've seen what the most
51:31 top-secret vehicles ever oh my god I did
51:34 yeah you know don't tell anybody it's
51:36 really great and it's on your side it's
51:38 always gonna be serving Americans or
51:40 Britain British people or whatever right
51:42 so just very easily you can change the
51:46 psychology in someone's mind from being
51:48 really on the precipice of making
51:50 contact with aliens and advancing our
51:53 relationship with the universe and going
51:55 right back into a whole
51:57 your government's the only thing out
51:58 there and that's why I want to talk
52:01 about Close Encounters of the fifth kind
52:04 which is Steven Korea's latest movie I'm
52:06 gonna give you some tidbits of the film
52:09 so if you're a person who absolutely
52:10 hates hearing anything about a film you
52:12 might want to watch you know there's
52:16 very little I'm gonna tell you I'm gonna
52:18 share one of the things in the film that
52:20 I think he should have put it in the
52:21 trailer which I think because he's
52:23 trying to trying to charge 20 bucks for
52:25 this movie and I was able to see it
52:29 thanks to a friend and I was for at
52:35 least an hour and a half I was pretty
52:37 disappointed with the information I
52:39 think anyone who's a hardcore even a
52:42 hardcore Steven Greer fan or at least a
52:46 UFO gist on the side almost nothing he
52:50 said for the first hour and a half was
52:52 remotely profound if you've read the
52:54 book even fifty percent of the book the
52:57 holographic universe it absolutely has
52:59 nothing to offer for an hour and a half
53:01 in my opinion but the last half hour is
53:04 really cool with some some miraculous
53:09 things so again you don't want anything
53:12 about it to Knopf just click the video
53:14 off but if you want to get and I'm not
53:17 going to ruin things for you I'm just
53:18 going to give you some reasons why if
53:20 you're interested in this content
53:21 hopefully I can inspire you to see the
53:24 film I'm sure at some point it'll be on
53:27 Netflix for at least a dry run here and
53:30 there because he typically moves his
53:31 content over there eventually the Steven
53:35 Greer's thing and he's what's really
53:37 interesting is is he's sort of following
53:40 a playbook in a different manner that
53:42 Whitley Strieber did with his book
53:44 communion
53:48 I think it's communion breakthrough and
53:50 transformation
53:51 it's either transformational
53:53 breakthrough last two books which I
53:56 found were awful wit least Reavers whole
54:00 thing is that Jesus sees a he's a writer
54:03 he's a fictional writer who then started
54:05 supposedly seeing tons of us are aliens
54:08 getting abducted all the time lots of
54:09 anal probing for the
54:10 okay so maybe he's got a little sport
54:13 going on the side with Maria brought a
54:15 [ __ ] as he covers with stories Steven
54:21 Greer
54:22 he's a clean-cut guy he's a doctor he's
54:26 a ER doctor up until the early 90s were
54:29 then he switches his entire career to
54:31 chase UFOs he then says very you know
54:36 his story is if I have this right it was
54:38 very quickly after he was doing this I
54:40 think in Florida he was pulled into the
54:43 deepest bowels of the government and
54:46 we're presidents of the United States
54:47 can't go this guy goes I mean it's like
54:50 all right careful there mr. gore you
54:54 know it's like that's pretty outrageous
54:56 claim me you know but he's a he's got
55:00 some interesting things he said over the
55:01 years one of the most one of the most
55:03 coveted things that he has said that I
55:05 think about routinely is I believe in
55:08 his movie at least by a serious movie
55:11 smelled like the star si R I u.s. I
55:16 believe is that he said look isn't it
55:19 strange that there's no university in
55:21 the planet that's looking for a
55:23 zero-point energy system that the Patent
55:27 Office says it's impossible right that's
55:29 what they said about the Wright brothers
55:30 and flying until they almost gave it
55:33 away to the French so he starts off his
55:37 film and it's really about this my
55:42 episode that's called consensus reality
55:44 which is that we are all thinking this
55:46 reality into existence but because we're
55:49 so indoctrinated by from birth and
55:51 perhaps even indoctrinated by instincts
55:54 dictated by our our genetics you know
55:57 the handed down knowledge from our
55:58 parents which I think might just simply
56:01 be a configuration of neurons in the
56:04 mind that has the disposition to be good
56:06 at music good at art good at calculus
56:10 right if your family continues to go in
56:13 all different directions and continues
56:14 to breed then it could be that you're
56:17 just equipped for a lot of different
56:18 things right
56:19 I mean Germans are all engineers it's
56:21 just a nutty thing
56:23 which may explain my fascination with it
56:26 so they start off and this is in their
56:30 trailer so this isn't a spoiler by any
56:31 means these trucks starts talking about
56:34 how they have random number generators
56:36 all around the world and that they watch
56:37 these random number generators as big
56:42 events that happen in history from
56:43 cataclysmic to just other events they
56:45 said that before 9/11 they all got weird
56:49 and that's because the consciousness of
56:52 man is supposedly changing you know what
56:54 I don't buy about that is that we didn't
56:58 know that was coming it wasn't like we
56:59 all said okay the new years is coming
57:02 and we could all think weird about what
57:04 could happen after 2000 switches over
57:07 from millennia to millennia
57:09 you know arbitrary designations in time
57:11 could definitely have an effect on us
57:15 but I've told you guys several times
57:18 that in the first 50% of the book
57:19 holographic universe which is and about
57:22 30 PhDs in the front cover
57:26 you're just inside the cover he covers
57:30 random number generators he covers the
57:33 pachinko algorithm which is any of
57:36 you've seen the Chinese game the
57:37 pachinko game they've got a bunch of
57:38 little pins inside really thin plate
57:42 with the piece of glass he could see
57:44 into it they drop a bunch of little tiny
57:45 ball bearings and usually they fall into
57:48 flowers and you're gonna win prizes and
57:50 all kinds of cool stuff but if you just
57:52 remove all the gamy part of it and they
57:53 need the ball capturing mechanisms and
57:56 just let the balls fall down into the
57:58 little catcher's down below these little
58:01 cups that catch the ball bearings you
58:04 always tend to come up with the bell
58:06 curve in the center and another thing
58:08 you can do to confirm this is if you get
58:10 a pair of die write on a piece of paper
58:13 2 through 12 and you just roll the die
58:16 and you put a little dot dot over the
58:19 number that you roll you will get a bell
58:21 curve towards 7 snake eyes and 12 very
58:26 very rare that those numbers come up
58:28 right so in the holographic universe
58:31 they talk about this experiment they've
58:34 done at several universities but they
58:36 have the kids
58:36 to the left think to the right Bobby
58:39 this all gets back to UFOs and so they
58:43 do adjust the curve a little bit you
58:45 know the bigger the pachinko machine the
58:47 more options the curve is a little bit
58:49 more malleable they have the guy in
58:51 Japan who froze water in a room with
58:55 people meditating towards the ice and it
58:58 made beautiful beautiful snowflakes when
59:01 you thought love at it in this horrible
59:03 glob of gobbledygook when you think mean
59:05 things added or hatred thoughts at it
59:09 now personally I would have to really
59:12 get that machine open sourced to know
59:15 that it's not being adjusted between
59:16 sessions to give the illusion this is
59:19 occurring to create a create money
59:22 inside the movie he talks about a city
59:25 of 200,000 smuggling in 2000 people to
59:30 think beautiful thoughts in the city
59:32 peaceful thoughts and it reduces
59:38 coincidentally by the cause and effect
59:40 is for us to determine but the ER visits
59:44 went down 28 percent other issues went
59:48 down significantly way beyond random and
59:52 so one of his goals is to get the whole
59:55 planet together 70 plus million people
59:59 which would be 1% of the world's
60:00 population and think in a particular way
60:03 such that we could change this reality
60:05 to the positive which isn't that
60:07 coincidental before he released his film
60:09 I did my episode where I talked about
60:11 how the secret could be used as a weapon
60:14 as well as a benefit so Greer zondas
60:18 it's good but our whole thing is that
60:23 through I want to say he said like
60:26 Maharaja
60:28 meditation methods they have this guru
60:32 technique where you think for 30 minutes
60:34 to get what's called blank mind and once
60:38 you hit blank mind which and you've
60:40 meditated you know it's very very
60:42 difficult to do and the more versatile
60:44 your mind is it's really hard but you
60:48 get blank mind we're just gotta be more
60:49 than just
60:50 there and he says he can feel these
60:53 beings in space and he can direct them
60:59 to his location and then he sees them in
61:02 one case he believes that he saw the
61:04 alien being itself when he's like 17 or
61:08 so but what he does to make money I as I
61:11 understand it other than just a
61:13 foundation that might raise money is
61:14 that he takes people out for sightings
61:17 and so you sit in a circle chairs like
61:20 mine blank it over your lap because it's
61:23 kind of cold park it out you're
61:24 encouraged to bring a camera
61:26 well they miraculously come up with
61:29 lights at some point in the meditation
61:32 these lights show up off off the coast
61:34 and they're dancing around and they go
61:37 away and they come back and all kinds of
61:39 stuff that he talks in the movie about
61:42 creating a protocol to communicate with
61:44 them but he's never talked about having
61:45 a conversation with them so like I said
61:48 in the previous episode it's easy to
61:51 create a baseball diamond in the sky as
61:54 a protocol with them and say fly to the
61:56 left for yes fly to the right for know
61:58 up for maybe down for we don't know and
62:02 they go to the center to wait for
62:04 another question
62:05 never saw that Plus here they are being
62:09 called by people that seem to love them
62:11 and nothing you know they don't ever
62:14 land and they don't ever come out and
62:16 talk to these people it defies logic for
62:18 me a hundred percent so I don't know if
62:20 he's got a gimmick little gypsy table
62:22 where the rooms full of special effects
62:24 right and in Iraq you know whatever the
62:27 smoke maybe you got someone down when
62:29 it's flying drones who knows right then
62:33 it comes to these photographs and we're
62:37 going to get into how he believes that
62:40 we actually how they travel a universe
62:42 which i think is sort of interesting
62:45 kind of hokey and I should say the dr.
62:49 Steven Greer has not seen her episode on
62:51 Einstein still believes the hoax of
62:53 Einstein and equals mc-squared
62:55 limitations of traveling the speed of
62:57 light any faster so his whole garb about
63:01 these aliens and their limitations
63:04 is that they can't travel and work
63:06 vehicles because they but take too long
63:09 to get here
63:09 and I have to say having made several
63:12 Springs video games in my lifetime yeah
63:14 you could be at warp 20 and it's still
63:16 going to take you a really long time to
63:17 get from point A to point B so there is
63:20 logic in that there's a different method
63:22 of flying around the universe we got
63:26 these circles people are taking
63:27 photographs every once in a while they
63:28 get these apparitions and growing up
63:33 having grown up with a professional
63:34 photographer as a father and in my own
63:37 experimentation with visual effects it
63:40 looks like a bunch of mishaps of bulb
63:42 exposures right you lock the shutter
63:44 open you sit there too long and you get
63:47 like strings of light coming off
63:49 people's faces don't know it's just sort
63:52 of looks like camera mistakes to me but
63:56 now we're digital and he took a shot
64:00 where there was a gentleman in the
64:02 circle who had a light being kind of
64:08 show up and again it's one of these kind
64:10 of John Lear things where they circle
64:13 well you can totally see the skull the
64:15 skull was like this big triangular thing
64:17 where little thin chin with a very big
64:20 skull it was must have been two two
64:22 times the size of a human skull in
64:24 vertical height and at least two times
64:28 and it's with that it's its most intense
64:30 point but Steven Greer goes oh yeah
64:33 that's the so-and-so race they're the
64:35 healer race okay you just totally know
64:39 that don't you back up a little bit here
64:42 how'd you find that out you know so the
64:47 interesting thing about the story and
64:48 this is for me again it's a two-hour
64:51 movie with all kinds of information and
64:53 if you're not obsessed like me you may
64:55 find a bunch of it really informative
64:58 but this should have been in the trailer
65:00 man I mean in my opinion he blew a
65:03 opportunity to add zeroes to his
65:06 paycheck on this one and again I have a
65:09 very sort of inquisitive positive
65:14 emotion towards this man but I just
65:16 don't know if he's being duped like
65:17 bill Cooper we're getting into that or
65:20 if this is all legit you know obviously
65:22 we all wanted to be legit but the dude
65:25 in the circle of which this apparition
65:28 appears over his head in a particular
65:30 photograph I don't think anyone said
65:33 they saw it with their naked eye maybe
65:35 they did he had a congenital hearing
65:38 problem meaning that by the age of 10 he
65:41 was clinically deaf and this made him an
65:45 introvert they interviewed this guy and
65:49 he was and I say this to his benefit he
65:52 was kind of a geeky guy which for me
65:54 adds more credibility to him and he
65:58 weeped on this little special and he
66:03 weeps because the next morning instead
66:06 of having to put his hearing aids in his
66:09 ear I think he said he had a problem
66:12 finding the next day which if any of you
66:13 have any type of appendage that makes
66:15 you more functional you don't lose your
66:19 glasses because then you can't see you
66:21 know you don't walk into your front room
66:22 with blurry vision
66:23 uh-huh just totally don't even realize
66:25 and have my glasses on right but he goes
66:27 out to eat breakfast and as he described
66:29 it he said that he sat down at breakfast
66:34 and he could hear everything fine in
66:38 fact he could hear the table right next
66:40 to him and that's something he could
66:41 never hear even with his hearing aids
66:43 and he actually had the hearing aids in
66:45 his hand he's just really really cool
66:47 you know those ones that really go
66:49 really deep in your ear and you can't
66:51 see him sort of thing but he says I
66:53 don't need him anymore
66:54 I'm totally healed and it wasn't like he
66:58 went to some religious revival where
67:00 they said you know who agree or can't
67:02 hear you know and they'd pray over maybe
67:04 could psychosomatically fix yourself
67:06 this dude had no idea that you know as
67:09 far as I know you'd have any idea that
67:11 this could just could take place now the
67:14 odd thing about the story I mean is one
67:18 that this happened at all you had a
67:21 close friend that went with him and his
67:22 friends like I can't believe this this
67:24 dudes can totally hear me now and this
67:25 is just absolutely mind-blowing but if
67:28 you had an alien come to a circle and he
67:31 human being wouldn't that be like all
67:33 the movies we've ever seen where someone
67:34 has the touch of Jesus and now it's
67:37 almost a moral imperative that you have
67:39 as many of these gatherings as possible
67:41 so that this Hitler could run around you
67:44 know healing deafness blindness mental
67:48 illness heart failure cancer everything
67:51 right so it's a little strange
67:55 no I guarantee if if some apparition
67:58 healed me and I had a friend it was
68:00 dying a cancer I'd be like okay doctor
68:03 girl we got to get back out there well I
68:05 don't even need you I know what you did
68:06 is there anything you want to tell me
68:08 that I need to do is it more apt to be
68:10 with you you know versus me by myself
68:14 but one of the guys as well which is one
68:18 reason especially if I tell you this
68:19 verbally and you haven't seen it
68:20 definitely make you want to see this
68:22 movie right down the street from me his
68:25 Newport Beach is a neighboring city with
68:28 Huntington Beach and a kid videotaped in
68:32 HD what he caught well it was like a
68:36 like a kidney beam of light in the sky
68:38 which didn't look like a UFO right miss
68:41 Cooper duper bright the kid calls it a
68:43 portal and I'm like Oh a portal huh and
68:48 so he then all said out of this little
68:52 super glowy being in the sky three
68:54 little pin lights fall out of this hole
68:58 and OH that's what you called a portal
69:00 because these things are popping out and
69:02 it then these three little lights
69:05 maintain an equilateral triangle meaning
69:08 equal distance from each other and
69:10 they're just kind of floating around in
69:12 the sky now I can tell you right now I
69:15 can do this in blender in my home get
69:18 Maya or Houdini you can get these things
69:20 done in your household now with no
69:22 problems at all
69:23 but then the dude continues the footage
69:26 and he says you know all these little
69:29 dots start falling out of this kidney I
69:31 mean a bunch of them and you're like
69:33 holy crap you know so it's either a
69:37 great little special effect or he just
69:40 recorded sort of like a
69:44 probably one of the most convincing
69:45 looking I don't know teleportations of
69:49 these beings to our universe now going
69:53 back to dr. Steven Greer I have seen him
69:57 in the past because we all have
70:01 generational things you know if I were
70:04 lying to you about anything that I had
70:05 ever seen if I tell you a big fib about
70:08 me seeing UFO meeting an alien of any
70:11 kind then my story is going to match the
70:15 culture of the time that I'm in the
70:19 maximum idea I've come up with will be
70:21 the maximum thing I've seen on in a
70:24 movie a television show read in a book
70:26 or my own creativity I'm a writer so I
70:28 could probably think up some interesting
70:29 new things but there's still a barrier a
70:32 threshold and a visible ceiling of what
70:34 I'm able to conceive of and so if a
70:37 hundred years from now for my fib you
70:40 actually do meet a real alien nothing's
70:42 going to match most likely and so for
70:48 any of you familiar with David Icke
70:50 David Icke has been a big proponent of
70:55 the reptilian alien invasion theory
70:58 where he believes that reptilian aliens
71:01 shape-shift to the shape of Queen
71:03 Elizabeth and that they're running the
71:05 world it's a very deep rabbit hole enjoy
71:08 it when Jesse Ventura who had his little
71:13 conspiracy show for a little while
71:14 interviewed David Icke it was the most I
71:18 don't know what the deal was it was the
71:21 most unprofessional interview I think
71:23 I've ever seen in my life
71:25 you would you it's unprofessional for
71:29 this particular reason what if I had a
71:32 music interview show I mean I'm always
71:34 interviewing new artists old artists
71:37 legends and I managed to get gene
71:40 Simmons and Paul Stanley on my show kiss
71:44 maybe even Peter Criss and Ace Frehley
71:47 I'm that lucky
71:50 if I publicize my show then I'm gonna
71:55 have a bunch of kiss fans watching the
71:57 show which is gonna be me and if I am
72:00 rude to any one of these people from the
72:03 band I will be basically Spidey my own
72:08 audience right I've brought the audience
72:10 that likes kissing my show and I take a
72:12 crap on kiss right you know great during
72:14 the interview I only give you that
72:16 analogy so that you can see what I'm
72:18 about to say and a little more focus I
72:20 think very few people are super angry at
72:24 David Icke for his willingness to
72:27 experiment with an idea that this could
72:29 be true remember David Icke went around
72:33 the world studied reptilian worship you
72:36 know the dragons in China the Dragons in
72:39 Japan the the serpent worship out of
72:43 Africa and what I add to it you know
72:48 this the Cobra over the third eye of the
72:51 Pharaohs in Egypt there's a lot of like
72:54 serpents and reptiles in history as
72:58 authoritative figures so David Icke did
73:01 has just had the balls to to boil that
73:03 up to something and because of the Zulu
73:05 shaman that he met and with a little the
73:08 big 750 year-old necklace with the
73:11 reptilian male with the phallus going
73:13 into a human female it looked like
73:16 they're crossbreeding stories going on
73:18 you know so he just called it he just
73:20 let it be what it was and didn't you
73:22 know he just went with it and developed
73:24 theories so he meets Jesse Ventura and
73:28 Jesse Ventura is a complete [ __ ] on
73:30 this show that's all David Dennis Miller
73:34 lost tissue he pissed off his guests by
73:37 being witty and condescending to his
73:40 guests and it was that you want to want
73:42 to see the show that killed Dennis
73:44 Miller show he interviewed the actor
73:46 that played the father on poltergeist as
73:50 well as the show coach and at one point
73:53 that guy was like he looks at the camera
73:55 and he looks at the any goes what's up
73:58 with this guy you know like this guy's a
73:59 dick and I'm on his show
74:01 I don't want to ever come back you know
74:03 but Davis said in the Jesse Ventura
74:06 interview very well I thought was that
74:08 he has identified the fact that through
74:11 the spectrum of light we don't see that
74:15 much of the light that exists just a
74:17 tiny sliver of the light is visible to
74:19 us and so he said these beings live in
74:22 those other spectrums of light and so
74:24 you can't see them so dr. Steven Greer
74:29 takes a little more scientific which I
74:31 definitely appreciate and it really gets
74:33 to my theory of Coral Castle which is
74:37 that you can resonate matter to
74:40 essentially stabilize so much that you
74:44 could actually push two objects kind of
74:45 through each other because they'll their
74:47 atoms will miss each other if they're
74:48 aligned properly with the Coral Castle
74:52 dude remember it's Coral Castle but it
74:54 was actually limestone not Coral you my
74:59 theory was that he was resonating the
75:00 stones with a sacred geometry pattern of
75:02 electricity which allowed ether to flow
75:04 through the stones making them rendered
75:07 pretty much weightless and he could pull
75:09 him off the trucks by himself again no
75:12 eyewitness said that he used a pulley
75:13 and you know a bunch of support beams to
75:17 get anything off the truck otherwise
75:18 everyone would tell the story that I
75:20 drove the truck underneath this thing
75:23 that hoisted them off the back of the
75:25 truck no he always pulled the stones off
75:27 by himself and just within a few minutes
75:29 so the guys can take off someone told me
75:33 once he said I went to Coral Castle and
75:34 it was really unimpressive and I just
75:37 thought that it's like well I haven't
75:38 been there but Jesus all right I'm gonna
75:41 pull up a flatbed truck you can use
75:43 anything out of his little workshop over
75:45 there I want you to get the 60 ton rock
75:47 off the back of this truck by yourself
75:50 go ahead
75:50 you 880 pounds he weighed 110 pounds not
75:54 only did he do it to all the stones get
75:56 it all worked out but he moved it like
75:58 25 miles south after that something like
76:01 that well by himself you know loaded him
76:03 up so uneventful impressive so Steven
76:09 Gers thing is that he took this
76:10 frequency model
76:12 and advance it up to the fact that
76:15 they're resonating their ships their
76:18 bodies everything into other frequencies
76:22 of existence and there's you know Star
76:24 Trek episodes about this what-have-you
76:25 and he had talked about a guy going into
76:29 Transcendental Meditation doing an
76:31 astral projection and that he's in his
76:34 what he calls his soul energy sounds
76:37 familiar to the show right and he's
76:39 blasting through the universe
76:42 sounds like a DMT trip to me but he
76:45 bumps into a spaceship his soul bumps
76:48 into a spaceship and he couldn't figure
76:51 out how that was possible and he said I
76:52 could feel the aliens inside the ship
76:54 going oh my god what's a human doing out
76:57 here in space or whatever right you're
76:58 kind of bodyless so what are you so you
77:02 know the big epiphany the big thing that
77:04 Steven Greer gave this guy was he
77:05 totally you know what's happening is
77:07 you're running into the spaceship that's
77:08 in that same frequency as your soul
77:10 which is sort of terrifying assertion
77:13 that your soul is a full tangible thing
77:17 that then aliens could then grab you you
77:19 know you die and they grab your soul oh
77:21 my god it's just not a great story
77:24 there's that there's a kooky theory out
77:26 there which doesn't make any sense based
77:28 on what we've seen that there's a cage
77:31 around Earth and that when we die we
77:33 bounce off the cage and we come back to
77:35 earth and that they own us fully strange
77:39 so he's baked it up to that level for
77:43 him that's profound for a lot of people
77:46 must be profound right now I would
77:51 probably be able to comfortably believe
77:53 this frequency changing thing but what I
77:56 don't understand
77:58 even with an electrical model of the
78:01 universe that's ether abased it doesn't
78:04 bridge the gap of you know point A to
78:09 point B now he gets into that that old
78:14 forgot what military general whatever
78:17 said it but I forget the guys name
78:20 because it's such a hokey little story
78:22 but it was one of these things about
78:23 remote viewing and some generals said
78:26 we've got the technology to send ET home
78:29 okay what's that did you find a
78:33 anti-gravity machine in the Nazi
78:35 laboratory after World War one - we'd
78:40 further pressed on that comment he said
78:43 well do you know how remote viewing
78:44 workspaces oh so you're talking about
78:47 consciousness can travel all over the
78:49 universe instantaneously he says exactly
78:53 now that's a little bit easier to
78:55 understand but I guess what might be the
78:58 case would be and this I don't believe
79:01 was outlined very well in the movie but
79:03 imagine I'm in a human body I do a you
79:09 know Transcendental Meditation
79:11 I astral project completely across the
79:13 universe slice in my consciousness
79:15 instantaneously across the universe
79:17 wherever the hell I'm going and I guess
79:19 you have eyes somehow to know where the
79:21 hell you are or sense of where you are
79:22 and now you find a place that's gonna be
79:25 a guest hospitable to what you know is
79:27 life because how would you manifest your
79:32 body in another realm unless you had
79:35 complete mechanical understanding of
79:37 what that atmosphere can provide what
79:39 gravity requires of you II throw
79:42 pressures etc etc so if I need to be
79:46 some crazy
79:47 what is it space troopers or whatever
79:52 insect doing thing then I have to
79:55 conceive of the body to create it and
79:57 you know maybe there's some trick you
79:58 copy the pattern of something that's
79:59 there like something infringe but the
80:04 part that sort of bothers me is that if
80:06 anyone is lying and maybe they're not
80:09 they were all trying to do exactly the
80:11 same thing the problem with it is is
80:13 that if if someone is feeding us a line
80:16 of crap like I said in my censorship
80:19 video then you can't make proper
80:21 connections and as long as you're kept
80:24 asleep right you're not to learn about
80:27 Nick
80:28 Tesla year to believe the ether doesn't
80:30 exist there to believe equals MC squared
80:33 which finalized a year before Einstein
80:35 was ever born which immediately
80:37 introduces all kinds of limitations to
80:39 mass and energy velocity all that kind
80:43 of stuff then you can never find what
80:46 you're looking for because someone is
80:47 lying to you about what you are but the
80:50 universe is so for me the men in black
80:53 just to loop back here
80:56 yeah it's it's one of these things it's
81:02 like the Hitchhiker's Guide said it's
81:04 holy unremarkable to me personally the
81:08 stories are pretty humanoid for a long
81:11 long time until this hopkins guy starts
81:14 talking about them having small noses
81:16 recessed Chin's weird skin rosy red lips
81:21 no hair on their bodies then all of a
81:23 sudden they just like a comedy in 2008
81:27 Niagara Falls they put the hair up
81:29 inside the house this will totally trick
81:30 them you know they're chasing around
81:34 this I mean this is what's if you watch
81:37 Fringe I mean I'm telling you the first
81:39 Fringe is one of the best shows ever
81:41 written in world history right they they
81:46 just it's it puts x-files to shame and
81:51 x-files is great but so let's just dial
81:55 back to the assertions of these MIB guys
81:59 you and I see a UFO according to all
82:03 these stories we have a pretty high
82:05 likelihood that a men in black 3 2 1 are
82:08 going to come visit us neither of 3 2 or
82:10 1 are gonna come knock on the door and
82:12 they're gonna know about us having seen
82:14 this UFO now that's pretty a pretty
82:18 amazing capability isn't it jeez
82:20 the dude no he had two coins in his
82:22 pocket supposedly he was able to make a
82:24 coin disappear in his palm he was able
82:26 to appear and vanish without any issue
82:28 you know the funny thing about the guy
82:31 that said that he vanished you know and
82:33 a puff of blue lights as soon as he
82:36 closed the door what happened to the
82:37 puff of blue light to arrive there in
82:40 the first place so if he was able to
82:42 keep the first puff of blue light out of
82:43 vision maybe that's to conceal his
82:47 powers and then he wants to show off his
82:49 powers as he leaves but if you had this
82:51 amazing capability if you watch friends
82:54 you'll see that the writer of Fringe
82:56 didn't let his his MIB people have this
83:01 limitation because they're looking for
83:02 Shane and know in 2008 right why the
83:06 hell don't they know where Shane is
83:07 they're like super duper crazy
83:10 the alien dudes why wouldn't they just
83:12 know where he is just use dr. Stephen
83:14 Gers there you go oh oh there he is
83:17 right there he's getting some ice cream
83:18 right there he's fixing his flat tire
83:20 right there so they have all these
83:22 capabilities but not the ones that
83:24 really close the gap for that right I
83:27 told you I we talked about Bill Cooper
83:30 because what I find interesting is that
83:32 the narrative changed in the 70s that
83:36 these men in black wanted people to go
83:39 and research things get into it get into
83:42 it and one guy said he was you know
83:44 potentially fed a bunch of bad stuff
83:46 until he goes insane that there was
83:48 gonna be an alien invasion
83:49 well it's interesting to find out what
83:51 the psyche would do I don't think he
83:53 would go insane believing that there's
83:56 an alien invasion I don't think that's a
83:57 formidable thought necessarily unless
84:00 you see something horrific done by these
84:02 aliens right oh well you see what they
84:04 did to my dog they turned him inside out
84:05 they're gonna do that to everybody
84:06 then you're freaked out that they might
84:08 be visiting the thing that drove him
84:10 nuts was that he said it in his mind he
84:12 had all the proof and no one would
84:14 believe him so if they really do it
84:16 there's no correlation between the two
84:19 results right the bill Cooper said in
84:23 1967 that he was on guard in the Navy
84:27 just to private or whatever and he's got
84:31 you know the dudes on the ship and he
84:32 said the ocean opened up and the
84:34 spaceships went boom boom and went into
84:36 the atmosphere scene by not only him but
84:39 other people on the deck at least one
84:41 other person and then before he knew it
84:44 it opened back up and to what he
84:47 believes to be two different ships went
84:48 back down inside almost like a little
84:50 trade off which is the whole you know
84:52 abyss story that they live on the bottom
84:55 of the ocean according to him the inner
84:59 command you know send a little message
85:01 on the walkie-talkie did you see
85:03 something there and he's like yeah I
85:04 don't know if I should try to tell you
85:06 what it is and they say come on in he
85:10 goes in he describes it within hours
85:15 men in black show up and I don't know I
85:18 mean if this ship was in the middle the
85:20 ocean and the helicopter down or if it
85:22 was just you know a little bit
85:23 from the bay I don't know but he was
85:26 given Q Clarence or some relative
85:29 Clarence like that which means you got
85:31 everything you got more than the
85:33 president United States and that he said
85:35 for the next 20 years he was given just
85:38 tons of UFO cases so for sure these
85:41 things are real and then he takes an
85:48 interview and I want to say it was 97 it
85:51 was a CNN interview at his house as it
85:55 was pitched it was really you know kind
85:56 of a crappy recording so I don't know if
85:58 someone recorded off TV is a four by
86:00 three aspect ratio but he said on his
86:02 sofa he goes you know what because I
86:04 know what I saw
86:05 67 that actually happened for sure but
86:08 he goes I think maybe everything else
86:10 that I was told might have been a lie
86:12 because nothing really amounted to
86:14 anything after that he never had another
86:16 close encounter so if you think about it
86:20 it overlays pretty closely with the
86:23 change in narrative of these moon and
86:24 black to say oh no you should totally go
86:26 for it you know this most important
86:28 thing in history you know go go go
86:30 the other thing I find interesting is
86:32 that there's this explosion of UFO
86:35 stories that are very credible the
86:38 murray island one is a witness by
86:39 multiple people and then you have the
86:41 roswell crash which is witnessed by
86:43 multiple people in two different ways
86:45 you have people that actually saw the
86:47 craft and the aliens who were
86:48 pedestrians as well as military people
86:50 all confess to that effect then you have
86:54 actually probably three layers second
86:55 layer is everyone who saw the materials
86:57 and said yes i held them in my hand
87:00 they're definitely not from this planet
87:01 and i don't know where they went
87:03 all right Patterson Air Force Base
87:05 rather they went third layer people are
87:08 all the spouses and wife's and best
87:12 friends of people that managed to see
87:15 the aliens to be involved with this and
87:18 they were all threatened one woman was
87:20 probably most certainly killed in sort
87:22 of a Dorothy Kilgallen manner where she
87:25 ends up in a hotel registered to her
87:27 sister's name she's a wife of two two
87:30 kids in a you know and her husband of
87:32 course she was the secretary that was
87:34 allowed to see the body from the door
87:35 jamb of a big room
87:37 they basically said come on down here
87:38 I'm gonna show you something this is
87:39 where the story goes she walks down the
87:41 hallway it's very believable for me
87:43 personally but they just took the cover
87:45 off away that's an alien quick she went
87:47 back to her desk then she told her
87:49 family that night what she had seen and
87:52 the next day she went to work she was
87:54 threatened and you know this is 1947
87:57 where you have to understand that no one
88:00 no one thought that their government was
88:03 a capable of being this evil against
88:05 them especially threatening them you
88:08 were a GI you were a stand-up dude men
88:10 and so that happens and in if you read
88:14 Whitley streamer's book majestic you'll
88:16 get a lot more dates exactly what I
88:20 think it was Truman that formed the CIA
88:23 out of the other acronym I can't
88:26 remember exactly what that was but they
88:29 start this program and they basically
88:32 said in his book that they realized that
88:34 these aliens were coming down and
88:36 capturing fetuses they were impregnating
88:40 people and taking the fetus
88:41 they were according to released Reaper
88:45 he's been up on spaceships and
88:47 impregnated alien women I mean I was
88:50 just take it with a grain of salt right
88:54 so the big thing out of the Greer
88:56 project is that he wants to get you know
88:58 77 million people together to cover the
89:01 bases of 1% of the world population to
89:03 all think of particular thoughts so my
89:06 question to Stephen would be what
89:07 thought would that be into you're not
89:09 going to get 77 million people most
89:12 likely to do anything even if you could
89:14 how do you rotate that thought around
89:16 the world right no one's gonna survive
89:18 meditating for 24 hours unless you have
89:21 a big bag of coke in the room right and
89:24 so not swearing to pull off the
89:27 experiment even if you had the
89:28 participants now the other thing that
89:32 starts to factor into this
89:35 is that you know from 1947 to say the
89:40 sightings going up to probably jeez the
89:44 late 80s not a whole lot reported in the
89:48 90s with these men and black folks but
89:50 we have the internet now and in my
89:54 experience the internet was pretty
89:56 ubiquitous in our lives by about 1998
89:58 yeah the iMac come out you just pull out
90:01 thing on the box hook it on the wall
90:03 boom you're on the Internet
90:04 but definitely by the early chief out mm
90:06 right by the Dan Akroyd moment you have
90:08 tons of internet so this idea that if
90:11 you see a UFO you're gonna suddenly get
90:15 visited by you know one of these men and
90:18 black you know it's kind of like well we
90:21 now see tons of footage of pilots having
90:27 seen these things people seeing them so
90:30 it's either they're all faking it or
90:34 these men and black guys have been
90:36 deprecated out of existence but we have
90:39 them walking into a hotel on video in
90:42 2008 and the thing is is that as far as
90:46 I understand the story of Niagara Falls
90:48 this was does this is what kind of falls
90:50 apart for me with the whole thing is
90:51 that they're looking for shame okay so
90:56 looking for did they ever find him no if
90:59 they had found him will he report the
91:01 rest of the story no one else seems to
91:02 have a problem reporting the conclusion
91:05 of their story it's been 12 years since
91:07 2008 most people all talked before the
91:11 10-year mark of their sighting of these
91:13 men and black so I'm talking immediately
91:15 no one's ever been killed as a result of
91:18 it one guy went insane in 2002 it died
91:20 but yes the internet sort of levels the
91:26 playing field you know once we had the
91:28 printing press we stopped having
91:30 christ-like characters occurred - maybe
91:32 Joseph Smith right but even he took
91:35 advantage of the fact that he was an
91:36 upstate New York and he says he's
91:38 finding these gold plates and all this
91:39 other stuff so it's always out of sight
91:41 out of mind he's and miraculous things
91:42 happen with God but the printing press
91:45 put a stop to us gaining a ton of new
91:47 messiahs the Internet has
91:49 greatly impacted any attempt to create a
91:54 consistent narrative about UFOs other
91:57 than in the last say five years or so
92:01 they've really been pushing the
92:03 declassification of UFO sightings by the
92:06 military one thing that dr. Steven Greer
92:10 talks about which and he talks about it
92:12 in a way that I like which is that he
92:15 says you know there there we just got to
92:18 deal with it let's get that out of the
92:19 way like first five minutes let's just
92:21 throw that out the way they exist
92:23 there's a bunch of different ones at
92:24 different ships different species and he
92:28 says that you know some are in his
92:32 estimation a hundred thousand years
92:34 ahead of man some are a billion years
92:35 ahead of min now I don't even know what
92:40 the hell we would look like a billion
92:42 years from now or what we would care
92:43 about in this universe of ours of our
92:45 civilization had survived that many
92:47 years you would think that almost
92:49 nothing would matter
92:50 you would be little mini Q continuum
92:53 creatures out of Star Trek right so let
92:57 me know what you think about this whole
92:59 thing and I'll be interested in your
93:03 elaborations on stories stories that I
93:05 didn't cover as far as I know I didn't
93:08 skip much the the keel guy and I did
93:13 find a lot of value in that you know
93:15 there's there's plenty of guys that are
93:17 charlatans that do these super rehearsed
93:21 presentations at podiums there's very
93:24 little Q&A ever
93:26 and typically the QA immediately reveals
93:29 the weakness of the claim like the was
93:33 the 2001 project disclosure the Steven
93:38 Greer did which is very admirable what
93:40 he did he pulled up pulled together a
93:41 ton of people in the military and
93:43 consulting groups that had seen UFOs and
93:46 said look you're sworn to secrecy but if
93:49 we all get together we can all reveal
93:51 what we've seen so everything right so
93:54 that was cool but one of the guys like I
93:56 said several times I think he said that
93:58 there's like 23 different species or
94:01 something
94:02 and then he said this British
94:06 journalists well what do they look like
94:08 and you could see the terror on this
94:11 guy's face that he just threw out a
94:13 claim that he hadn't thought of his
94:15 answer to and say oh they look like
94:18 someone just look like us you know well
94:20 of course there's a Grey's you know I'm
94:22 it's just like come on if this dude knew
94:25 even a dozen hell if I even knew five
94:28 different alien species I would start
94:31 rattling off the differences well one of
94:33 them is closed eyes one of them is the
94:34 the grades but they work for these other
94:36 folks and there's the tall whites on the
94:37 moon and or and I go through all the
94:40 things but this guy just just
94:42 face-planted bright on camera and no one
94:45 ever calls it out it's really weird
94:46 it's like we're all in cognitive
94:47 dissidence we want to believe we want to
94:49 believe and then it's like the facts of
94:51 the of the claims are really bad anyhow
94:57 hope you dug the episode this is for 99
95:00 hopefully it's as good as the one I made
95:02 last night it turned out to be a blank
95:05 of any audio so if you have minute deep
95:08 thoughts video calm please go we have
95:10 all of the feeds there we have two
95:12 reliable video YouTube add bit shoot we
95:15 have two podcasts for all the device
95:17 that you could possibly bring to the
95:19 game we have four social media if you're
95:22 into Facebook please do join the
95:23 Facebook group it's locked so now we can
95:25 see what you're doing is your own
95:26 private world with a bunch of people
95:27 like-minded IQs and souls and we're just
95:32 all looking to to put our thoughts
95:35 together and you know the one thing I
95:36 don't really talk about is that the
95:37 Facebook does deal with issues I don't
95:39 do episodes on all the time which are
95:42 episodes about current events you know
95:46 so if you're suffering from an anxiety
95:48 of a current event go right there or you
95:51 know you're down a rabbit hole and
95:52 you're stuck or you're down a rabbit
95:54 hole and you're feeling strange about
95:55 what you learn bring it into the group
95:57 you'll find that there are
96:01 pretty like-minded folks there if you
96:03 are big q and on person I want to
96:05 recommend a friends page which is called
96:07 the Vincent Fusco page just go look that
96:10 up and you'll see him holding a poster
96:12 as the header image the other one I'm
96:17 doing more often as tweeting so
96:19 definitely getting some like-minded
96:21 people to come over to the channel from
96:22 there the other one is minds comm which
96:24 is a First Amendment protected Facebook
96:26 copy which is beautiful I really really
96:29 like it I hope that they're the utter
96:30 replacement for Facebook and there's gap
96:33 comm which is sort of trailing behind
96:35 features so we'll see where that goes
96:37 there's a couple ways to donate to the
96:39 page there's PayPal and patreon I just
96:43 want to thank every single one of you in
96:44 the last 30 days I've just had this huge
96:48 surge in the patreon and some folks drop
96:52 in donations in PayPal what that does is
96:55 if you get into PayPal for sure I can
96:56 get you the episodes before everyone
96:58 else sees them on most occasions this
96:59 was going to go out immediately because
97:01 I'm a day behind because of the bad
97:03 recording most of time 80 85 percent of
97:07 the episodes are there for a couple days
97:08 before anyone else gets to see them that
97:10 turns you on
97:11 you also get in the credits so whatever
97:13 handle you use gets in the credits
97:15 forever and if you want some shots keys
97:20 we have a store with a couple different
97:21 shirt designs they're gonna go on for at
97:24 least another couple weeks here as
97:28 season 5 comes to a close I'm working on
97:30 a big project right now which will
97:31 become season sixes intro so that's cool
97:35 if you're looking for a season one it's
97:38 not on this channel because I had to
97:39 remaster all the episodes so that link
97:41 is also on the website so go over first
97:43 hundred episodes are mostly for you
97:46 formats a little bit different because I
97:47 had the microphone two inches from my
97:49 mouth I apologize since repaired that
97:52 been anyway till the next episode take
97:55 care of yourself and someone else and
97:57 I'll see you in the next deep thoughts
97:59 over now
