00:00 [Music]
00:33 welcome back gentlemen deep thoughts
00:37 today we are gonna talk about remote
00:41 viewing for some of you you will know
00:43 exactly what remote viewing is and for
00:46 some of you you're gonna say what's that
00:48 it's an extremely interesting concept it
00:53 is almost in every case hard to believe
00:58 it sounds like an ancient art and it
01:03 sounds as if any if anyone had this
01:05 skill they would be able to pretty much
01:12 dominate the world with absolutely zero
01:14 resistance for any of you that watched
01:17 Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure back in
01:19 the day there was a point in the script
01:22 for these two guys Keanu Reeves and the
01:24 other dude we just saw in a Bitcoin
01:26 documentary recently they if they needed
01:29 something they would remember to go back
01:30 and put it underneath the rock and
01:32 behind the bush or whatever and they
01:35 were able to go back in time make that
01:37 happen instantaneously and so if they
01:39 needed something just remember to make
01:41 sure they put it there all sudden it was
01:43 there immediately right by the way I'm
01:45 smoking my cigar for my buddy Dean yes
01:49 this hole did Mona Rey Cuban beautiful
01:53 cigar but what is remote viewing
01:55 okay so let's catch up real quick
01:57 because what's interesting about it is
02:00 it's not terribly difficult for me to
02:01 describe what it is but it'll be
02:03 probably fairly difficult if you haven't
02:06 heard of it before for your being brain
02:09 to grasp and accept it to the level of
02:12 which your lists willing
02:13 to watch an episode for an hour about it
02:16 and write if you're completely verging
02:17 on this as the story goes the United
02:20 States government discovered that in
02:24 secret the Russians had started this
02:27 program first through a series of
02:32 training techniques a human being is
02:35 able to view sitting down wide awake
02:40 eyes wide open other parts of the world
02:45 you can not only see it's pretty much
02:48 every conceivable viewing apparatus that
02:52 you could imagine and you can view the
02:53 past you can view the present you give
02:56 you the future you could view a city a
02:59 location is minutely down as you
03:02 possibly want supposedly down to
03:03 subatomic particles and all the way out
03:07 to seeing the entire universe one is
03:10 able to achieve mind-reading techniques
03:13 a little bit of the dreamscape movie
03:16 back in the 80s is a great film the
03:20 story goes is that in the 70s the CIA
03:23 finds out about this situation created
03:27 by the Russkies and so they put a lot of
03:30 money into this and created a project
03:31 called Stargate Stargate and all the
03:37 project names there's tons of project
03:39 names Dragoon was a dragoon absorbe
03:43 there's for your reptilian people
03:45 Dragoon absorbed sort of God David I
03:49 should jump on that but it's
03:51 computer-generated project names as we
03:53 understand it we start you know getting
03:56 people who've defected to tell us what
03:57 the hell's going on depending on who you
04:00 talk to it's a five step program it's an
04:02 eight step program it's a six step
04:04 program so we don't know I would explain
04:07 how this thing is has been explained to
04:10 me in terms of how it works then we'll
04:13 both be skeptics on how it could work
04:16 and whether or not we're all doing it a
04:20 little bit already but the CIA ramps up
04:23 this project you get a black budget
04:27 and we start pulling in totally random
04:31 people that have very sophisticated open
04:34 minds and then people that are actually
04:38 psychic now psychics and remote viewing
04:43 people there's this big effort to make
04:45 sure that you don't get the two confused
04:48 because remote viewing does not require
04:51 any psychic abilities it does not
04:53 require any out-of-body experience as a
04:55 matter of fact if you do have an
04:58 out-of-body experience you may or may
05:00 not be remotely in the realm of remote
05:03 viewing right again I think I've said a
05:07 long time ago in an episode I was
05:10 working with the guy the city his
05:11 girlfriend was telling him that she was
05:13 having out about experiences astral
05:15 projection every single night that they
05:17 were together and I said okay well then
05:22 do me a favor I said you have a dresser
05:25 I said yeah I said take the take a
05:27 sweater something put it in the top
05:29 dresser maybe even just a random object
05:31 put it in the top drawer of the dresser
05:32 shut the door tell her that night asked
05:35 her project into that top drawer and see
05:36 what the hell you put in there and see
05:38 if she can figure it out I'm like
05:41 eighteen years old that was the end of
05:43 her claims it's funny how these
05:46 attention [ __ ] are so easily caught
05:51 but here's the thing so the the
05:53 government of the United States of
05:55 America we can we I don't think we have
05:57 the numbers from the Russian government
05:58 but but they were claiming over 80%
06:01 accuracy for remote viewing and again
06:05 this could be just like ghostbusters you
06:11 know there's the very beginning of the
06:13 movie they're flipping up cards and
06:14 trying to figure out what color things
06:15 are so let's get into how it's done so
06:20 I'm going to tell you how they do it as
06:21 according to their training and then
06:27 we're going to examine sort of all of
06:30 the theories that I profess on this show
06:34 about how the universe is put together
06:35 and how it works and then we're going to
06:37 bring them together and see if we can't
06:38 explain something now according to the
06:41 the main secret is just to simply be
06:43 told that you can do this which is very
06:45 interesting it's kind of open your mind
06:47 sort of thing
06:48 the first thing they say to you is okay
06:50 look you have a conscious mind and you
06:53 have your unconscious mind you're gonna
06:57 have to be aware of what your conscious
06:58 mind is going to be doing during this
07:00 process and what the unconscious mind is
07:02 gonna do in the process you know when
07:05 you dig a conscious and unconscious or
07:07 subconscious you I should say
07:09 subconscious sorry you don't sit around
07:11 controlling your subconscious very often
07:13 it's down there like the the molten lava
07:16 underneath the 9/11 buildings right just
07:19 does what it does do you dig it up and
07:21 you find it and so when you're going for
07:24 an image or you're getting into this
07:25 kind of thing you're going to be excited
07:27 to see it work right and it's probably
07:31 the worst state of mind because as your
07:32 consciousness gets excited you know
07:36 you're starting to put a lot of subject
07:37 matter into your brain you're
07:39 envisioning perhaps what you're gonna
07:41 see maybe some people will envision
07:44 being a superhero in two months because
07:47 they can do this so that they could have
07:49 all the parties where they're gonna
07:50 impress people you cloud your
07:54 consciousness and so the first thing
07:58 they want you to do is to meditate 10 to
08:01 20 to 30 minutes a day multiple times a
08:05 day in a quiet place with very little
08:07 sound meaning you don't have like my
08:10 situation where cars drive by that are
08:13 hot rods motorcycles drive by wind is
08:16 blowing on me right now of course cuz
08:18 I'm doing a show I set this whole thing
08:21 up again not a single puff of wind and
08:23 then mother nature gets so excited but
08:28 the meditation is for you to quiet your
08:31 active consciousness and let the
08:34 subconscious take over because
08:36 eventually or your consciousness will go
08:38 to sleep another way to do that which is
08:41 a little more brutal is to stay up
08:43 really really late way beyond your
08:44 normal hours of consciousness then your
08:47 left brain goes to sleep your right
08:48 brain takes over and you'll have a lot
08:51 more
08:52 kind of control of chaos but don't worry
08:56 about that particular technique so what
08:59 they tell you is look if we say we want
09:02 you to view a particular location or a
09:05 particular thing and we give you too
09:08 many details then you will envision what
09:11 you already suspect you're searching for
09:14 and your consciousness will grab
09:16 fabricated history real history and
09:19 shove it into the basically a composite
09:23 layer of cameras right so if you think
09:25 about editing software on a computer we
09:28 take you know a green screen is the back
09:30 and the persons in front and then when
09:33 we push that together we replace the
09:35 green screen or something else so it's a
09:36 big layering mechanism and what they
09:39 want to make sure is that you don't put
09:40 any layers in out of creativity or just
09:44 habit you know the big examples would be
09:47 if I said envision the pyramids from
09:50 Giza now we're going to look inside the
09:53 Pyramids of Giza the problem with me
09:56 pre-populating your brain with that
09:58 exact location is that if you're a buff
10:02 in Egyptology you've seen a documentary
10:05 you've read a book or etc etc you're
10:08 gonna automatically start imagining
10:09 things you might even imagine you know
10:11 alien stories or whatever your current
10:14 philosophy is you'll mix and match so
10:18 they need a way to get you to those
10:20 coordinates on the surface of the planet
10:23 without a predisposition of what you're
10:25 going to see so how do they do it well
10:29 according to them it's almost it's like
10:32 a ridiculous technique okay most of you
10:36 are familiar with longitude and latitude
10:40 coordinates when you see the sphere of
10:42 the earth you'll see lines that go up
10:44 and down around the sphere on flies to
10:46 go left and right same thing on a flat
10:49 map not a flat earth map but a flat map
10:52 and so we've got a coordinate system
10:55 we've built from the center point at the
10:57 North Pole all the way down to the
10:58 bottom point on the South Pole
11:02 and so we give you a longitude latitude
11:04 coordinate for those of you watch the
11:06 movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind
11:09 the message within the song was all
11:14 about where to go which ended up being
11:17 Devil's Tower so according to the remote
11:21 viewing community they give you a
11:24 longitude latitude coordinate which is
11:26 usually some gigantic number any of you
11:28 fiddled with Google Maps you know how
11:29 big these these coordinates are talking
11:32 probably seven to eight digits of
11:34 accuracy for two separate digits with a
11:37 decimal floating point in there now
11:40 supposedly with someone having
11:42 absolutely no knowledge of longitude
11:45 latitude coordinates any orientation
11:47 whatsoever these candidates were able to
11:52 discover where they were and start
11:58 seeing stuff party sounds pretty fishy
12:00 right again I don't think the universe
12:05 has a longitudinal latitudinal system
12:08 that it somehow recognizes at an atomic
12:10 level right sure you can always
12:14 arbitrarily measure something but in
12:16 terms of the fabric of the universe
12:18 being embedded into the mind of man and
12:20 having it be some lookup table that the
12:25 man that man meaning mankind can use to
12:28 look up a location just seems super
12:31 far-fetched however there might be a
12:33 link we're going to get into between
12:35 other people who actually know what that
12:38 corner system is and you might be
12:40 bouncing your consciousness off them
12:42 knowing it's a pyramid so I think that
12:45 quite frankly remote viewing and ESP and
12:48 just normal proximity of human beings
12:50 could be a very dangerous mix it's
12:53 almost like you have the triple double
12:55 quadruple blind the experiment get
12:58 someone in a warehouse completely out of
13:00 proximity of another human being and
13:01 then what you get would be real so now
13:04 here's the game they give you
13:07 longitudinal latitudinal coordinates
13:10 latitude and honor you know if that's
13:12 real longitude latitude coordinates and
13:13 you start seeing images
13:16 that'll start happening is you get
13:18 what's called the gestalt you heard me
13:20 talk about this on a show a lot it's a
13:22 German word for the single image that's
13:24 worth a thousand words a gestalt
13:29 I think comes with an emotional capture
13:32 as well as a visual capture of what
13:35 you're seeing if any of you have seen
13:37 the movie brainstorm back in the day
13:38 with Christopher Walken as they had this
13:40 VR tape that was recording your entire
13:42 body's spectrum of senses it would be
13:45 one splice second of that real would be
13:49 a gestalt the cigar has proven to be one
13:52 of the most difficult cigars that ever
13:53 smoked in my life Jesus it canoed badly
13:58 and quickly it probably canoed about 30
14:02 minutes worth of smoking in about five
14:04 minutes now from that point forward
14:07 there's a several very specific
14:08 techniques that start to occur one
14:12 they've developed this symbolic alphabet
14:14 for symbols such that one does not have
14:18 to something in its entirety
14:21 you can just write certain symbols down
14:23 instead of writing lake la ke and be
14:26 burdened with four letters of
14:28 construction during this viewing process
14:30 they have a little looped line of course
14:33 mountains planes how homes they have all
14:37 kinds of little shorthand symbols for
14:38 everything maybe it is shorthand [ __ ] or
14:41 no but what that does is that keeps the
14:44 consciousness in flow and keeps the
14:47 consciousness out there where they're
14:49 supposed to be viewing and not worried
14:50 about the paperwork right in front of
14:52 them if you were to concentrate too much
14:53 on the room that you're in you literally
14:56 lose connection with where you're sort
14:58 of projecting your viewing apparatus
15:00 inside your brain now a lot of times it
15:03 has to do with seeing a location and you
15:07 sort of get these just snapshots of
15:09 where you're looking Jim Marrs who is
15:14 sort of a I think he's sort of a
15:19 novelist novelist write novel as in a
15:23 joke and novel as in writing a book I
15:26 don't mean to discredit him by saying a
15:28 joke he's put together one of his
15:30 best books I've ever read is the was a
15:32 the rise of the fourth reich i think he
15:35 was dead on in that book and a lot of
15:36 areas and we've been able to prove that
15:39 well at least we think we've seen proof
15:43 that he's very correct about you know
15:45 nazis fleeing to argentina what-have-you
15:48 and i was watching some video the other
15:53 day it was like maybe it was a I think
15:55 it was a interview with Mel Brooks and
15:57 Dick Cavett and he said well you know
16:00 you know they all fled to Argentina and
16:04 this is a Jewish director who's very
16:05 brilliant who wrote to heard the
16:09 producers where they did this Hitler
16:11 musical so you seem like he would know
16:13 and you know he just said it was a joke
16:16 but but the story that Jim Marsh tells
16:19 is that he had written a book about
16:22 remote viewing and I think it was
16:25 supposed to be published in 1995 and he
16:29 said that when his book was submitted
16:31 for review it you know passed all the
16:34 the law the legal references passed its
16:39 literary edit but you he had the same
16:43 time someone coming out saying that
16:44 remote viewing was complete crap and the
16:46 press it's kind of the subdermal press
16:48 and then his book was cancelled so here
16:53 it is you know any publisher looking at
16:55 a finished book on the table written by
16:57 a renowned author slash reporter gumshoe
17:01 kind of guy it's worth money it's worth
17:03 money just sitting on the table just
17:05 released the book do a conservative run
17:07 he even said there was pre-sales for his
17:09 book and they cancelled it and so
17:12 sometimes that happens for stupid
17:14 reasons I've worked on video games that
17:16 were cancelled and someone might you
17:18 know want to throw a conspiracy in there
17:19 but you know in the end what we didn't
17:22 admit to the public was that the guy who
17:24 was designing the game didn't know how
17:26 to design a game and even though the
17:27 artist made the most beautiful thing
17:29 we've ever seen
17:30 it just couldn't get finished because
17:33 the talent didn't exist internally but
17:36 he says you know look it was as if
17:38 someone didn't want this information out
17:40 there maybe he had done an excellent job
17:43 of reaker
17:44 eating the steps of learning how to do
17:47 this
17:47 and then you know the if it's really
17:53 easy to do and it's very dangerous to
17:56 have everyone being able to see and you
17:58 know certain douchebags brains will
17:59 marry fifty ones at risk s for is at
18:03 risk
18:03 wright-patterson Air Force bases at risk
18:05 and he plays something secrets going on
18:07 it's at risk the Pentagon you know
18:09 imagine 9/11 being remote viewed before
18:12 it happened and we find out all the
18:15 scumbags that you know pulled that off
18:17 so the process essentially continues
18:21 through different metrics of what you
18:23 see you write it down you compare notes
18:26 and of course in your training process
18:29 they're giving you things that they
18:30 already know and so and again it would
18:34 have to be utterly triple double
18:37 quadruple blinded meaning if they had
18:39 like a lock box and when al gore's lock
18:42 boxes and it always has the Apple in it
18:44 and they keep running students through
18:46 and they're waiting for the students to
18:47 come up with Apple well the problem is
18:48 the instructors know it's an Apple the
18:50 students can read it off the instructors
18:52 brain and get an accurate reading when
18:55 all they're doing is reading minds in
18:56 the room because human beings exchange
18:58 knowledge without talking this has been
19:01 very proven one of the most simple
19:04 experiments is people touching foreheads
19:06 before I think about fifteen to thirty
19:09 minutes and then they're separate into
19:13 RF proof rooms radio frequency proof
19:15 rooms and they can still be each other's
19:17 minds when one person's talking to
19:19 someone else or seeing a giant
19:20 photograph of something the other one
19:22 knows what they're seeing it breaks off
19:25 very quickly right there's also
19:28 mentioned and that the relevance of your
19:32 brainwaves is very important which is
19:35 why Stanford University assisted the CIA
19:37 in creating this supposedly right hate
19:40 to implicate any university if this is
19:43 all just hearsay but supposedly this is
19:46 all above-ground stuff and again I'm not
19:47 revealing any major secrets at all we're
19:50 gonna have more fun than most folks in
19:51 this subject matter by by talking about
19:54 how the universe is put together you
19:56 know when you go to sleep you go into
19:58 I think it's alpha-beta which creates
20:01 the randomized movement you know your
20:05 eyes flickering quite a bit and they say
20:07 that's really where you have your dreams
20:09 and then you go into Delta and you start
20:13 to not dream anymore and you start
20:15 getting that satisfying sleep
20:17 according to Star Trek you got to have
20:19 REM - so you gotta have all these
20:21 different stages just again a big
20:23 question is - why we dream and what the
20:26 hell going to bed at night it's all
20:28 about we'll save that for the other show
20:30 but there's a deeper frequency called
20:33 theta and they say that if you can get
20:37 your consciousness down to theta or you
20:39 could get into your subconscious data
20:41 you start to have higher and higher
20:44 accuracy levels of seeing everything in
20:47 the universe now this all seemed a
20:51 little hokey to me until one woman I saw
20:55 and Jim had said this - but one woman
20:58 had explained seeing the future and then
21:02 all of a sudden her descriptions click
21:05 with me on a personal level because I
21:11 think that one of my tricks personal
21:13 tricks for being creative and it this is
21:16 could be creative in an algorithmic
21:18 manner it could be a design thing could
21:22 be writing a story writing a screenplay
21:25 I see the future it may not be my future
21:32 verbatim but I am seeing a future and is
21:36 it's been this way since I was a kid and
21:38 I'll link this to an interesting other
21:42 person you know who says the same thing
21:44 but when I teach creativity in school
21:48 this is the way I do it I tell someone I
21:51 said look imagine you know me personally
21:53 all of you have seen my face on this
21:55 YouTube channel and then all of a sudden
21:58 I come into your place of business
22:00 or your home and I and I know you I've
22:05 permission to approach you and I rush up
22:07 to you and I'm slightly older you can
22:10 just tell my hair is perhaps Gray's that
22:12 you know and I'm excited and you feel my
22:16 energy and you're like this is kind of
22:18 cool look at mark man he's all excited
22:20 I'm like hey hey you got to come with me
22:23 right now and you're like okay what are
22:26 we doing you won't believe me and you
22:29 won't believe me until you see it you
22:31 trust me right yeah
22:32 again you can kind of see I'm a little
22:34 older somehow I like that distinction
22:37 because it has a little more spin to the
22:40 story I take you outside I have got a
22:43 flux capacitor attached to the the
22:45 latest 2016 DeLorean which looks amazing
22:48 and you're like what the hell is this I
22:50 say it's a time machine
22:51 let's go hop in the butterfly doors are
22:54 up you hop in kind of excited just to
22:57 take a ride even if I'm full of crap but
22:59 inside just like doc all those gadgets
23:03 are in there the timelines in there and
23:05 I'm dialing it up and I say to you look
23:07 you affected the future in a way that no
23:11 one ever saw it coming and it was what
23:16 you've done has been just phenomenal now
23:18 I'm gonna show you you're partially
23:20 responsible for this car they could
23:22 travel into the future
23:23 are you interested you say yes take you
23:28 in the car push all the right buttons
23:29 flash boom we're in the future it's not
23:34 quite as intense as you thought it's 10
23:37 or 12 years in the future but things are
23:40 different you can just start to see that
23:43 this sort of futuristic world we've all
23:45 fantasized about is sort of coming to
23:47 fruition
23:48 you know old buildings aren't gone or
23:50 anything and people aren't wearing
23:51 completely space-aged
23:52 you know ralien clothing but something's
23:56 different and I started taking you to
23:59 this kind of central center place in the
24:02 city sort of like a park or this seems
24:04 to be in a festival or something going
24:05 on I parked the car around back with
24:09 some big buildings you haven't seen
24:10 before obstructing your view you can
24:12 hear some excited people around the
24:14 corner and we've got about a 50 foot
24:17 walk from the car to the edge of this
24:20 building we turn the corner
24:22 I guess for some reason we can't take
24:23 the car there we hop out of the car
24:27 you realize you just traveled into the
24:29 future you're not even sure how many
24:31 years probably better if I said maybe a
24:36 hundred years and then shits really
24:37 different right but we're going up this
24:39 corner I say look you you change this
24:42 you're gonna see what you did come on
24:45 let's go and now we're kind of walking
24:47 quickly just out of excitement to the
24:51 edge of that building and we're gonna
24:52 turn the cone I say it's just right
24:54 around the corner what you did is right
24:56 around the corner you're gonna see it
24:57 this is awesome and I'm taking you know
25:00 taking every single step you get closer
25:02 to the corner of that building knowing
25:05 that when you turn the corner and you
25:07 look you're gonna see what you did it's
25:10 personalized it's you did this not
25:12 anyone else did this and so you start to
25:16 think to yourself well Jesus Who am I
25:18 what what what do I know whether you're
25:21 a housewife or a super scientist or
25:24 whatever what did I do to make this
25:26 happen
25:27 and you start searching in your brain
25:28 searching in your brain you go to your
25:30 subconscious you go to your existential
25:32 insides you access the Delta you access
25:36 the theta you access everything that is
25:38 your mind's eye which is where this
25:41 talent exists before you make the turn
25:45 around the corner I assure you that at
25:48 the to the degree you can roleplay this
25:49 in your brain and be feel free to do
25:51 this every day of your life several
25:54 times a day you will already have a
25:57 vision possibilities if nothing more
26:01 than just a thread and what you're
26:03 capable of doing to go around the corner
26:06 and see it but you will see it before
26:08 you see it you will see the finished
26:11 product now you're not gonna see maybe
26:14 it's full detail its full luster its
26:17 exact purpose but inside yourself you
26:19 will one have a tremendous amount of
26:21 faith in who you are all the sudden you
26:23 didn't already have it if you already
26:24 have it'll be even more jacked up and
26:26 more amazing and the way I tell the
26:29 students is I say look stop right there
26:31 right when you get to the edge of the
26:33 building the corner blocks stop what do
26:37 you see I just go through all the
26:39 students what do you see
26:40 and you know it's funny is the students
26:43 will usually lose sight of me in the
26:46 process the Seraph kind of starts
26:47 staring at the ceiling and staring into
26:49 oblivion and they're seeing their mind's
26:51 eye they're stopped using their eyeballs
26:55 completely in this process that little
26:58 trick is is pretty much exactly where
27:01 the remote viewing community wants you
27:03 stop seeing the room start looking into
27:06 your mind's eye start seeing what's
27:08 there a lot of you already have this
27:10 talent to look into your mind's eye but
27:13 you have to regulate your consciousness
27:15 infecting your subconsciousness such
27:18 that your knowledge in this world what's
27:20 in the room with you maybe a previous
27:22 conversation is just right before you
27:24 get to this remote viewing exercise is
27:28 pretty much shut completely out now in
27:32 this particular example I'm feeding you
27:34 with the idea that there's an there's
27:36 this thing you did but by me never
27:39 telling you what that was not even a
27:41 category whether it's music or art or
27:43 architecture or science I'm leaving it
27:46 to you you got to search your own brain
27:48 but the beautiful thing is it's
27:50 beautiful whatever you did now when I
27:55 wrote but when I write any of the films
27:58 that I write I get into the story in my
28:01 brain and it just lives in my brain I'm
28:04 seeing the future of this story perhaps
28:06 I'm seeing the past of it's an
28:08 historical piece and the trick is to
28:11 constantly see it almost like
28:12 Nostradamus claimed to see the future
28:15 and to actually write it down accurately
28:18 for any of you've ever been artists and
28:20 you see the image of what you want to
28:22 draw in your brain but you struggle to
28:23 get it on paper you know even my good
28:26 friend Sid need struggles with that and
28:29 he paints photographs he paints and even
28:32 seen Blade Runner Tron or any of the
28:34 stuff he's ever done he sits and goes
28:38 into this sort of mind's eye technique
28:41 to find out what he's looking for and
28:44 again the guy draws a thousand sketches
28:46 before he finishes any design for
28:47 anything if you hire him for a spaceship
28:50 he's gonna have a thousand doodles of
28:53 what that spaceship could look
28:54 like just keeps drawing and drawing from
28:57 you know his brain and then illustrating
29:00 it on paper to figure out what a turn
29:03 looks like da da da and he always finds
29:04 excellence because he keeps going back
29:07 in to look in the future until he finds
29:11 the future that's why the movie title
29:14 visual futurist was invented by him out
29:17 of his brain given to Hollywood for
29:20 Blade Runner and I believe even Tron and
29:24 it's now become a common title for folks
29:27 in Hollywood who draw futuristic things
29:30 for films last year I had an epiphany
29:33 with some hardware design and the way it
29:36 went was I I kept looking at how certain
29:40 hardware configurations were being used
29:42 to create imagery and I just kept
29:45 looking at and I kept having this
29:46 feeling in my chest if this is [ __ ]
29:48 stupid the way that they do this is just
29:51 stupid this is old paradigm thinking we
29:54 need to get past this
29:56 I started looking the way the data was
29:57 being transferred between hardware and
29:59 I'm literally crawling out of bed and
30:04 I'm sort of it's early so I'm sort of
30:06 you know I gotta be in LA by 9:00
30:09 o'clock you know which from Orange
30:11 County is a good Drive got to get ready
30:13 before I go and just crawling out of bed
30:15 I just saw through my floor I saw
30:18 through my reality into this other
30:20 reality and the finished product was
30:23 staring right at me
30:24 total epiphany of invention hardware
30:27 invention I've now documented that
30:30 submitted that to my investors they've
30:31 had it vetted by dozens of people and
30:34 they're like holy [ __ ] this changes the
30:36 whole game
30:37 reduces costs it reduces heating it
30:40 reduces failure rates and simplifies the
30:43 entire stream of data to create this
30:45 imagery cool right now you guys are
30:49 thinking about what I did in your mind's
30:51 eye you're trying to read my brain see
30:54 how that works the reason why I take you
30:57 on this little side digression is
30:58 because I believe remote viewing is
31:00 something we all do every day all the
31:03 time
31:03 now perhaps people who brush with the
31:06 extra you know
31:07 to dine fluoride toothpaste perhaps they
31:09 don't do it very well
31:10 people who toxify themselves with things
31:13 yeah maybe you interfere with your third
31:16 eye and that thus makes you more docile
31:18 and sort of useless to society again
31:21 hopefully if you watch this show you've
31:22 detoxified you've watched the toxins
31:24 episode you've watched the cancer
31:26 episode and you're starting to live a
31:28 little bit of a different life but I
31:31 went through this process probably for
31:34 about almost 40 years just doing this
31:38 since I was a kid
31:38 Papapa and I think all of us have done
31:40 it I'm not special you've all done it
31:42 too you just may not have put a name on
31:44 it right and then I'm listening to
31:49 Michael Jackson interview coincidentally
31:52 he and I have the same birthday by the
31:53 way pretty cool
31:54 58 was a good year for geniuses being
31:57 born let me tell you and he said you
31:59 know the way I write music is I just
32:01 envisioned it being complete I do my
32:04 best to pull that completed song into my
32:09 reality and then we make music and
32:11 obviously he had a pretty good success
32:13 rate right I used to wonder you know you
32:17 know Elvis Presley never wrote any
32:19 lyrics I don't even think he wrote any
32:21 of his songs people you know he's the
32:23 king of rock and roll okay Elton John
32:29 never wrote any lyrics but he wrote the
32:31 music to lyrics interesting or he'd
32:33 write the song someone else to write the
32:34 lyrics right so all that credit he gets
32:36 for writing you know all of his songs
32:39 well those are some one is one guy
32:40 writes all of his lyrics so they have a
32:42 great team together it's great just like
32:43 musicals are written right so I was
32:46 under the impression that Michael
32:47 Jackson was probably one of these kind
32:48 of guys he's surrounded by Quincy Jones
32:50 and all this amazing artists and I
32:53 thought well maybe Michaels just really
32:56 a talented performer and I should look
32:59 for the people that really make it all
33:01 happen now of course there are people
33:02 that are amazing that help to make
33:04 things happen but then I watch the
33:07 interview after interview of him writing
33:09 music and beatboxing Michael could
33:12 beatbox and he was totally different
33:14 than anyone else and he has all these
33:15 sound libraries from his mouth that I've
33:18 never heard anyone really do
33:20 and he integrates it into his songs
33:22 right little pops and snaps and he he's
33:25 and not kind of stuff but when I heard
33:29 him say it I was like oh my god what are
33:31 the odds that a guy's born the same day
33:32 I am relatively throughout the year
33:35 right this arbitrary thing we do the
33:37 birthdays and he's doing this habitually
33:43 and he encourages other people to do it
33:45 so how could this possibly work how
33:49 could we possibly see the future I mean
33:52 you might say well it's your imagination
33:54 man mm-hmm all right
33:56 imagination is the idea that your
33:58 subconscious is always fiddling like you
34:01 know a bunch of elves working for Santa
34:04 and that you just merely through
34:07 wavelengths of thought you essentially
34:11 open the doors like get smart and you
34:13 just keep going into your subconscious
34:14 deeper and deeper and deeper until you
34:18 can see what you're already creating if
34:20 that's never really sat well with you
34:22 then I think we're on to a good
34:24 conversation right now I've done
34:26 episodes on gravity where I tell you no
34:29 ether all winds are gravity it's a it's
34:33 a push not a pull you know which is why
34:36 BIGBANG can't be what it is there's
34:38 nothing on the outside to push in an
34:40 absolute singularity vacuum model right
34:45 we have folks that tell us that the you
34:47 know the universe is built out of
34:48 frequencies which it definitely has
34:49 infinite vibrations going on constantly
34:52 and that we're merely we are the radio
34:56 the apparatus the DNA double helix
34:58 antenna chain that accesses it just like
35:03 a radio you just turn to a channel and
35:06 you listen I'm sure there's some truth
35:09 to that I'm sure there is but what's the
35:11 sort of subatomic reality of that notion
35:14 because that sounds like an easy way
35:16 just to claim something and walk away
35:18 from all the science it's actually
35:19 making it take place right now if I said
35:22 if I had left out the fact that you can
35:25 see the past and see the future then we
35:29 would be stuck in the now which is
35:31 really the only time that exists is now
35:33 and if I said okay what's in that
35:35 Lockbox now and you were able to see it
35:38 well then you would have pretty much a
35:41 model in your brain where you're going
35:43 okay that makes sense to me that really
35:45 exists right now I'm going to you know
35:49 use frequencies to put my mind's eye
35:52 into the box and see what's there but it
35:56 exists it really is there and so if you
35:58 want to think about how to sort of reach
36:00 through the the chaos of colliding
36:03 particles and colliding frequencies and
36:05 you're essentially just filtering all
36:09 the frequencies that you see with your
36:10 senses until you just isolate the
36:13 frequencies that come out of the box you
36:17 know you've seen these things where both
36:20 noise cancellation is a really good
36:22 example I showed a video last year know
36:26 I shot a video this year as a matter of
36:27 fact where the room wasn't quiet it had
36:29 a sort of generator running the
36:34 cameraman could not get the sound right
36:35 because he didn't bring the right
36:36 equipment and so I had a lot of fuzz on
36:40 the track that need to be raced and so I
36:42 brought it in to audition in photos in
36:45 the CSS suite from Adobe I took a sample
36:48 of the noise and then they have the
36:52 software that will cancel that noise out
36:53 of the sound wave of the rest of the
36:55 recording and it worked unbelievably it
36:58 worked instantly and it was perfect it
37:01 was really just phenomenal how how great
37:03 that product is what they're doing is
37:06 they're subtracting the Delta of that
37:09 frequency of looking for the frequency
37:10 within this spectrum of sound that's
37:12 going on in the file right well you and
37:15 I have that ability for every sense that
37:18 exists whether or not we understand it
37:19 exists or not like I said in the
37:21 infinite census episode we really do
37:23 have an infinite level of census because
37:26 for any sense that you can put your
37:28 finger on just like a number set that
37:30 goes up forever and down forever in the
37:32 negative space and then it's subdivided
37:34 forever right there's infinite numbers
37:36 between 0 and 1 because of fractional
37:39 references right so in order to see
37:43 what's in the Box you merely subtract
37:45 out like if it's here in this
37:47 kind of randomly windy day I got
37:49 helicopters flying over cars driving by
37:51 dogs barking a couple blocks away I
37:55 would just subtract all that sound and
37:58 if there's a little you know it almost
38:00 infinitely quiet
38:02 Music Box going inside this other box I
38:04 can't hear it unless I subtract out all
38:07 that sound you do that and you do this
38:09 in crowds all the time someone's talking
38:11 to you in a loud crowd you subtract all
38:15 the noise in the crowd you look at their
38:17 lips and you hear the sound and you
38:19 start to focus on your friend and you
38:21 can hear what they say but at first you
38:24 couldn't even it's even if it's just a
38:26 split second it was all mishmash in your
38:28 brain it was a crowd making noise right
38:32 that's subtraction that Delta of reality
38:36 is what the remote viewing is built out
38:38 of in my opinion now the genius of being
38:44 able to do that even in a crowd my
38:46 little example that we've all done it's
38:49 pretty phenomenal there's something huge
38:51 going on in our ability to I think again
38:55 have a soul and have a body it's not a
39:00 Christian soul with a Jewish soul it's
39:02 not an Arab you know Allah soul Muslim
39:04 soul or anything like that it's just
39:05 it's what you are the complex energy
39:08 that gives you identity right the other
39:12 one is having the belief that breaks the
39:16 paradigm that you can't do this you know
39:19 like I said in a previous episode
39:20 recently every day that we are alive
39:22 your brain is closed by learning about
39:25 paradigms there are rewards for
39:28 recognizing anything in the world if I
39:31 didn't recognize this thing I'm sitting
39:33 on as a chair I would never sit on it
39:35 I would never realize I could get relief
39:37 from my body standing up but I recognize
39:40 it as a chair if you take that to an
39:44 existential level and you say I need to
39:46 recognize the fact that I have the
39:48 capability of thinking right I think
39:53 therefore I am
39:53 it's a huge was a decart that said that
39:57 right it gives us power
40:00 gives us ability gives us distinction
40:03 and once you gain a new tool in the
40:07 world you gain pretty much an infinite
40:10 spectrum what you can do with that tool
40:12 if I never learned how to talk think
40:14 about how much of my life would
40:15 disappear if I didn't think I could hear
40:18 all that kind of stuff right but we
40:22 think we need to take a step back and
40:24 look at how information travels in the
40:26 universe because we always view things
40:31 well we acknowledge spatial associations
40:35 between objects I'm sending a backyard I
40:38 can see a palm tree about 20 feet away
40:40 from me all right well I think it's over
40:44 there
40:45 and I'm over here but let me just play
40:49 with your brain for one second here what
40:53 if everything is a singularity we are
40:59 sitting on top of each other and every
41:01 object in the universe is right on top
41:02 of each other there really is only one
41:04 particle I know that's a screwball thing
41:09 to think about here right then your
41:14 access to everything in the universe is
41:17 totally conceivable all of a sudden
41:19 because everything that ever was is one
41:21 thing not probably physically speaking
41:25 that's a bad analogy for how things are
41:28 actually put together but let's just say
41:32 that everything is connected somehow
41:35 you know when I talked in the gravity
41:37 episode and I can't remember what
41:38 episode after that but the big question
41:40 is whether or not the universe is a
41:42 static object or a fluent object now
41:45 when we look at again a current in water
41:49 when you look down at the tub when you
41:51 pull the plug when you see the swirl of
41:53 water or in your sink or whatever you're
41:56 acknowledging that swirl down there as a
41:58 vortex a little swirl but if you drop
42:02 dye a colored dye into that water supply
42:05 it goes down through the vortex and it
42:08 disappears but the vortex continues to
42:10 exist
42:12 the substrate that is giving it its form
42:14 is constantly in movement and the force
42:17 that is actually being exerted is also
42:20 going down and becoming the velocity of
42:23 the water shooting down the pipe things
42:26 travel faster and vortexes there's a lot
42:28 of water filtration systems that use
42:30 vortexes to to energize water to give it
42:33 electrolytes and that kind of stuff
42:35 because they're infusing it with the
42:36 energy that you're drinking this is part
42:39 buddy of mine used to design those
42:40 things I've never seen that personally
42:42 so what are the other things that we are
42:44 taught about the universe we're taught
42:46 that there are fixed velocities in time
42:50 and space right the speed of light has
42:53 always been given a a designation and
42:59 they state they tell you that falsely
43:01 that it's a constant in the universe and
43:03 it's actually not a constant in the
43:04 universe even on planet earth
43:06 universities attracts me to light all
43:08 over the place they also tell you that
43:10 you can't go faster than the speed of
43:11 light
43:12 Eric Dollard in his basement in 1988
43:15 with a the borderland group he created
43:20 down there I think it's what they called
43:21 it he built the circuit right in front
43:25 of your face a longitudinal wave circuit
43:28 that went 11 times the speed of light on
43:30 camera with the voltage meter counting
43:32 how fast the circuit completed well
43:35 technically speaking what he just did
43:37 was impossible because the first thing
43:39 he built was a transverse wave and it
43:42 traveled yeah bus 80% the speed of light
43:46 which is about typical and a normal
43:48 computer if they build computers with
43:50 longitudinal waves then you would have
43:53 an instant transfer of information again
43:56 the analogy is this if you and I held a
43:58 rope between us and I flipped the rope
44:00 and the wave goes to you you can see the
44:03 you can see the time required to get the
44:07 wave to you but if you and I held a
44:09 broom pole a big dowel of wood and you
44:13 got one and I got the other end you push
44:15 it I push it you instantaneously fill it
44:18 on the other side the whole thing has to
44:19 happen at the same time well if we think
44:22 about the universe and all consciousness
44:25 being
44:25 more longitudinal than transverse then
44:30 you have instantaneous transfer
44:32 information everywhere in the universe
44:34 at all times as long as you can get your
44:37 consciousness down to these waves where
44:39 that sort of information exists for
44:42 those of you Star Trek fans you'll know
44:44 about the tachyon tachyon is a
44:46 theoretical particle that always travels
44:49 faster than the speed of light it's what
44:51 these transmissions from the enterprise
44:55 to earth are all about you know the
44:57 sub-ether wave net you know where you
44:59 can send a message faster in speed light
45:01 back there still takes some time on the
45:03 show because otherwise they wouldn't
45:04 have any drama you know waiting for the
45:07 message to come back but we need to
45:09 throw a fiction and simply say we can
45:14 see then now at least all around the
45:17 world instantly all around the universe
45:22 instantly because information about
45:26 those areas about its construction
45:29 information about another person's
45:30 feeling is instantaneously recognizable
45:34 as long as you know what to look for
45:35 like me looking for the chair to sit
45:37 down in you would tune your brain to see
45:41 what you're looking for we know that
45:43 there are people that see auras they see
45:46 the emotional frequency coming off a
45:48 human body and those frequencies
45:50 translate to colors and the visual
45:51 cortex if that's the way you choose to
45:53 see it and they can look at you and say
45:55 oh you look really happy oh man what's
45:57 wrong you look really sad they've tuned
45:59 themselves to that and the most deadly
46:02 thing for man is if all men you know
46:05 let's say a hundred thousand years ago
46:07 could see auras because it was a sort of
46:10 sort of a mechanism prior to our
46:13 elaborate language right if you don't
46:16 have the vocabulary to express yourself
46:18 then the internals of your brain never
46:20 developed that far right the second -
46:23 you increase your vocabulary you start
46:24 to figure out who you are and then
46:27 better your vocabulary the better you
46:28 learn who you are and then the epiphany
46:31 after that is finding someone else with
46:32 an equally elaborate vocabulary that you
46:34 can then converse with which is why when
46:37 you talk to dumb people you feel like
46:39 you're dying
46:39 and when you talk to smart people you
46:41 feel like you're growing and living in
46:42 blossoming like a rose there's a handful
46:46 of people in this world that when I talk
46:47 to them I feel like I'm alive and it's
46:51 not that I have all the answers or
46:53 anything like that or I'm showboating my
46:54 brain I'm just going oh my god this
46:56 guy's overwhelming here the scroll is
46:58 overwhelmingly with their intelligence
46:59 and this is great I'm the student all of
47:02 a sudden in the conversation and there's
47:04 nothing no better feeling for me
47:05 personally than that level of
47:07 consciousness even when a random friend
47:09 of mine just has an epiphany and tells
47:11 me well you know what I was thinking
47:12 that the duh and it's something I never
47:14 thought of man it's it's a joy right so
47:18 this is why I made the infinite senses
47:20 episode because in reference this
47:22 upcoming episode I was going to make
47:23 because I want you to understand our
47:27 senses are so dumbed down in this world
47:30 that remote viewing seems like magic
47:32 seems like a hocus pocus story but
47:35 really in in the end all you would be
47:37 doing is acknowledging what you can
47:40 actually access in this universe
47:42 aka see now let's just say that you're
47:46 able to get in touch with your your I'm
47:52 gonna see astral projection but your
47:53 ability to see things that you have many
47:55 able to see before that relate to sort
47:57 of remote viewing talent your challenge
48:01 at that point is to see things that you
48:04 don't understand at all you know if we
48:07 had a life force in the universe that is
48:10 something we really have never seen
48:13 personally perhaps a being lives in pure
48:15 consciousness they don't have any
48:17 instrumentalities whatsoever like I said
48:19 and Forbidden Planet then your ability
48:21 to conceive of them is very challenged
48:24 you're gonna have to have some other
48:25 existential thing here on earth where
48:27 you live to see them someplace else and
48:31 this is where we get to one of the other
48:32 sort of stories that relates to remote
48:35 viewing and again this is sort of fringy
48:38 I don't want to take a piss on this
48:40 because it makes sense on one level but
48:45 people who remote view and I'm gonna
48:49 leave astral projection out of this
48:50 thing you will loop back to how you
48:52 might see the future in
48:53 past is that they some folks have
48:58 reported that they meet beings and this
49:03 is very similar to folks who have taken
49:05 DMT and I have not met a person who
49:08 takes DMT raw that hasn't claimed to
49:13 have met a race of beings that are sort
49:16 of in that realm of consciousness and
49:19 DMT you know it's almost like a cheat a
49:22 cool cheat to get your third eye turned
49:25 on 2:11 and your consciousness sort of
49:28 goes away one of our listeners reported
49:30 taking DMT and this is a very common
49:33 story if you read the DMT dream molecule
49:36 book written by the researchers of the
49:38 United States of America taking I
49:40 believe like it gets like 1,200
49:43 milligrams shots of DMT their bodies and
49:46 I've seen the videos of this by the way
49:48 their bodies really turned into sort of
49:50 the bath salts people and my explanation
49:54 for that is that your consciousness your
49:56 soul has now disengaged from your body
49:58 leaving your body this sort of autonomic
50:01 system with very little consciousness
50:04 left I mean you obviously have some sort
50:06 of you know the hidden do is call it the
50:07 silver core but you have some connection
50:09 with your body to return to your body no
50:12 one that I know of has taken DMT and
50:13 just disengaged you know completely and
50:17 died or something like that but your
50:20 body's left and it's be this could be
50:21 what bath salts are doing to people as
50:23 well the body goes into a mega feral
50:26 state and cannot speak language and is
50:28 terrified of its surroundings and I
50:31 swear you see all these really horrific
50:32 trips that people are rolling around in
50:34 their living rooms because you know I
50:37 think you need your soul to actually see
50:39 and when your soul disappears to go off
50:42 on some journey the majority of it does
50:44 your body is really left in this chaotic
50:46 state of absolutely horrific thought but
50:48 when you return to your body you don't
50:50 remember any of it because your
50:51 consciousness is left and so this
50:54 marriage between folks that say they see
50:56 this race of aliens you know some go as
51:01 far as to say the gray aliens and they
51:03 try to put it on it but I think that
51:05 again could be them superimposing their
51:06 conscious
51:07 this on to the scene they say the aliens
51:10 you know are very ambivalent very
51:12 friendly very loving but they always say
51:14 you can't stay here one because you
51:16 don't have your body with you and two
51:18 this is sort of our domain and you don't
51:19 belong here you know we don't mind a
51:21 couple visits but don't make it a habit
51:23 one of my friends took a tremendous
51:25 amount of DMT really endued man
51:28 he's invented a video game that almost
51:30 everyone's played if you grew up in the
51:32 90s he he said he took his last strip of
51:36 DMT because when he met his alien
51:40 handler eventually the handler got
51:43 pissed grabbed him by his shoulders and
51:46 pushed his face against his buddies my
51:48 buddy's face and said you know this is
51:51 your last trip man don't come back I'm
51:53 starting to get angry that you're
51:54 abusing your privilege of doing this
51:57 which was a very interesting thing
51:59 because he he's smart enough to know
52:02 that he didn't take DMT that last time
52:06 fearing that this would happen because
52:08 if he did then then he could take
52:11 responsibility for the context of what
52:14 occurred in case he's imagining this
52:15 right but he was expecting a great trip
52:18 excited to see his little buddy his
52:21 little alien buddy
52:23 and he was rejected so the other half of
52:28 this is that the remote viewers say that
52:33 eventually these creatures that they see
52:36 do get angry that they're there and I've
52:39 heard all kinds of stories about that
52:40 where people will take it in the living
52:42 room and all of a sudden these beings
52:43 are present in the room as if they are
52:45 living a separate life in the same space
52:47 and there's sort of this feeling that
52:52 you know it's like two feelings oh
52:54 there's another one meaning us pushing
52:57 into their world and sort of the feeling
53:00 of why don't they just stay where they
53:02 are they're not supposed to be here so
53:05 you kind of get this unwelcome feeling
53:06 sometimes even on your first trip of DMT
53:10 so I don't know how you get the good
53:12 ones and the bad ones so be aware we
53:15 might not be alone
53:17 and it may not be in a physical form
53:18 that we are so used to right so let's
53:22 loop back to this notion of being able
53:24 to see the past and being able to see
53:25 the future again we live in a body that
53:28 really only acknowledges the now the
53:30 only reason why we believe time exists
53:32 is because we have the mechanism of
53:34 memories impressions that are you know
53:42 you and I go to a baseball game together
53:43 you've got pictures in your brain sounds
53:45 and you're getting feelings taste
53:46 everything and you remember those you
53:50 just put them in some archives somewhere
53:51 using part of the universe as a database
53:54 okay so the question is I'm gonna mix a
54:00 couple things together here there's
54:04 douglas adams who wrote The Hitchhiker's
54:06 Guide of galaxies which I've talked
54:07 about and then there's a movie called
54:09 altered states with William Hurt who
54:14 checkers guy went first let's talk about
54:16 what he talked about as a fictional
54:18 funny thing he said that a scientist had
54:20 figured out how to take a slice of fairy
54:22 cake which i think is an imaginary thing
54:24 in itself and he was able to extrapolate
54:27 the entire history of the universe out
54:28 through cause and effect meaning one
54:30 particle it's an other particle it's
54:31 another particle and because it's all an
54:33 algorithm of cause and effect he was
54:36 able to reverse-engineer cause and
54:38 effect and see the past pretty brilliant
54:41 idea fictitious can't you know story
54:44 around that but it's a sort of a
54:46 plausible idea in the movie altered
54:49 states the obsession of the main
54:51 character played by William Hart whose
54:53 name like the fictional name completely
54:54 escapes me is that he said you know I
54:57 believe that mankind has the entire
55:00 history of mankind and the universe back
55:02 to original life in a chain of events in
55:07 our DNA and our memory and he was taking
55:10 drugs and going as deprivation tanks to
55:12 try and regress himself back to the
55:16 original moment of life and in the third
55:19 act he got his way and he was horrified
55:21 by what he saw or technically speaking
55:24 what he didn't see and his wife sees him
55:30 in the end
55:30 in the end it's a love story but there's
55:35 no reason why on some existential level
55:39 again the mathematics that are far
55:42 outside of our ability to consciously
55:44 understand that we might be able to push
55:48 the effect of this cause-and-effect map
55:53 forward and so we can see into the
55:56 future now what is my huge question is
56:01 that do we do we create the future or do
56:05 we merely experience the future what
56:08 does that mean well for those of you
56:10 familiar with the deterministic sort of
56:13 approach of the universe there are two
56:17 schools of thought there you have
56:19 religious determinism which is that God
56:21 has written in a book everything that's
56:23 supposed to occur and then you sort of
56:25 have your scientific determinism which
56:27 is this is just merely the way it is the
56:31 fear that comes in to the rest of us who
56:34 look at those theories is that we say I
56:37 want to think that I have choice you
56:40 don't want to believe you're an
56:41 automaton and no matter how creative you
56:44 think you are you are really just living
56:47 out some pre-written script but because
56:49 you are ignorant to what the next step
56:51 is because we don't have consciousness
56:53 developed to that level we maintain this
56:57 hubris that we are actually individual
56:59 creatures and that we have our own
57:00 thought processes when you see a dumb
57:04 person do something it really hurts your
57:06 feelings that perhaps that was something
57:08 the universe wanted to have happen right
57:10 especially as they affect you drunk
57:13 drivers hitting people in cars who are
57:15 completely innocent people reading cell
57:18 phones and hitting people we don't want
57:20 to believe that we're connected to the
57:22 stupidity we don't want to be connected
57:24 to that stupidity we want those people
57:25 move to another dome you know I can tell
57:29 you that I can see something that hasn't
57:31 occurred yet and I can see it in the
57:33 most vivid beautiful state of my current
57:38 understanding of the senses I don't get
57:40 any extra senses or I don't see a sixth
57:42 sense of any kind that I know besides
57:44 the ability
57:44 see this stuff when I write a script you
57:48 know it's like I think it's what
57:49 directors and writers go through is that
57:51 they the director is on set trying to
57:55 get the scene into the camera that will
57:58 eventually be composited into a movie a
58:00 television show a story of some sort and
58:02 they look at the scene they look at the
58:05 performances and they know the actors
58:06 either hit it or didn't hit it the
58:08 beautiful thing is the hive mind of a
58:10 group of people coming together to make
58:12 a story happen and everyone's starting
58:14 to get it because the writers
58:16 communicated beautifully to the director
58:17 the directors reinterpreted the writers
58:19 intent to a visual format and they they
58:24 know how the actors should behave and so
58:27 they are you know a little direct it's
58:29 what they do they direct human beings
58:30 and they said well you know could you be
58:31 a little bit more surprised I want your
58:34 eyes a little more open let's have a
58:35 little more stress in your voice you
58:37 know you're crying too much you're not
58:38 crying enough all these different things
58:40 and they are they've simply made a
58:45 profession out of seeing the future but
58:48 we don't acknowledge it that way but
58:50 that's what they're doing they're
58:51 creating the future very hands on what
58:56 should be much of a stretch to think
58:57 that there's a form out of this where
58:59 you don't have your hands on things but
59:01 I'll tell you it's it's like I've said
59:03 in several episodes if you don't ask a
59:06 good question you're not going to get a
59:07 good answer right ask a stupid question
59:10 you get a stupid answer you've heard
59:12 that before right
59:13 ask a smart question you get a smart
59:14 answer so to the degree that we believe
59:17 that this is possible we get the
59:19 privilege of gaining this information
59:22 because we know how to write the
59:23 database query into the database but if
59:26 we do not have the ability to ask the
59:29 question intelligently what could
59:31 possibly occur now sometimes people will
59:34 get utter epiphanies and you never know
59:37 could be a spirit on the other side is
59:39 written a great joke they find a
59:41 comedian that matches their style and
59:42 they go Boop right and the guys at
59:44 dinner with his wife or you know the
59:47 girls getting standing in line getting
59:48 married and all of a sudden the funniest
59:50 thing occurs to either one of them and
59:52 they find a way to write it down tell
59:53 the joke to someone else real quick
59:55 don't let me forget this but Papa
59:57 so if you listen to the theories of
59:59 remote viewing and it seems a little
60:00 crazy to you I would suggest it's kind
60:04 of a nefarious practice by the
60:06 government to spy on other people
60:08 sure of course it's always in the and
60:11 the public eye it's pitched as the
60:12 matter of national security to figure
60:14 out what the Rooskies are doing or
60:15 something right in the end it's
60:17 providing bankers the technique of
60:20 creating more elaborate Wars in almost
60:23 every sense of the of the use now remote
60:26 viewing is supposedly used by folks to
60:28 find you know people who are missing
60:32 missing people but what's funny about it
60:34 as I watched quite a few episodes on
60:36 this on YouTube before making this
60:38 episode and it's interesting how people
60:40 who claim that they're experts at this
60:42 will kind of lean away from things that
60:44 are really productive because it maybe
60:48 they're full of [ __ ]
60:48 who knows right one woman talked about
60:51 just almost a laughable example of using
60:54 remote viewing where there was an
60:56 earthquake somewhere very serious
60:57 earthquake rescue workers were missing
61:00 people were missing and there big a you
61:03 know contribution to the puzzle was to
61:06 determine where they were and whether
61:09 that whether or not they were alive or
61:10 something like that
61:11 and it was it was anything that you
61:13 would have been able to guess having
61:15 heard that some tiny little scenario on
61:17 this show and you go well there's a
61:19 50/50 chance they're alive or dead so
61:20 big odds on that one
61:22 and then the other one is well they're
61:24 probably where they were last you know
61:26 so if they're working on a particular
61:28 building and that building fell down
61:30 what they're probably around that
61:32 building and that's all this woman did
61:34 was say well they're right by that
61:35 building
61:35 okay well that's last time we saw them
61:38 and you already knew that so there's
61:40 definitely a lot of posers out there
61:42 that again usually are the folks that
61:44 need a tremendous amount of attention
61:45 they've they've never acknowledged why
61:48 they're special in normal ways and so
61:50 they've come up with this you know this
61:52 fanciful way to be special so we're get
61:54 a lot of you know astral projection
61:55 people that don't have you know if you
61:58 could astral project you realize what
61:59 you could do you could uncover every
62:02 conspiracy in the world you could astral
62:05 project into Bilderberg meetings and
62:07 come out with a hundred percent accuracy
62:09 of
62:10 everything that was ever said in those
62:11 rooms just make sure you're asleep when
62:13 they're awake and he'll the thing
62:14 happens in Europe all the time so
62:16 Americans should be able to spy on
62:17 Bilderberg meetings so this was
62:19 something that was super duper simple to
62:21 do that's again the astral projection
62:24 people say super simple I aster protect
62:27 I leave my body I go to these specific
62:29 locations I can see hear taste smell
62:31 everything right it's not quite that
62:33 awesome but it's definitely being able
62:35 to see in here seeing is all you would
62:37 ever need half the time right but we
62:42 don't have that we solve mysteries all
62:43 over the universe no one's making
62:45 youtube videos saying while I've asked
62:46 for projected into the hangars of area
62:49 51 and this is exactly what I saw and if
62:51 you look on the satellite map you see
62:54 that that's this and that's it no one
62:55 ever does that right we have this you
63:00 know this Planet X thing that you know
63:05 it's a bunch of attention getters online
63:08 saying they've channeled people from
63:10 Planet X and again their stories are as
63:13 hokey as you know sort of a bad sci-fi
63:17 novel out of the mid-1800s you know
63:19 coming here to enslave mankind to mine
63:23 gold the gold is then used as a
63:25 preservative to the atmosphere of Planet
63:27 X because they can't live without gold
63:29 in space but they've got the ability to
63:31 travel interstellar early they've got
63:32 the ability to engineer genetically
63:34 mankind but they haven't figured out
63:36 common fusion to take mass and turn it
63:39 into whatever the [ __ ] they want right
63:40 it's just absurd so I think that's a
63:43 bunch of [ __ ]
63:45 people selling doom Wow
63:47 it's just like the Catholic Church we
63:50 convince you that God has abandoned you
63:52 due to some hokey story of creation
63:54 you know the Adam and Eve thing the
63:56 Apple and you're now punished by an
63:59 infinitely brilliant creature you
64:00 couldn't see that coming right so what
64:03 they do is these Planet X people these
64:05 was the twenty twelve people they they
64:09 tell you that the world is going to end
64:10 and boy you need to come to them to get
64:12 all the scoop on everything if the world
64:16 ends then guess what you don't have to
64:18 pay any taxes and you get to meet God
64:20 right away and all your relatives and
64:22 all that good stuff
64:23 so enjoy the enjoy it don't don't fear
64:27 it right the chances are its publisher
64:31 trying to create a bunch of kind of
64:34 new-age books at Barnes & Noble so
64:35 you'll buy them
64:36 it's trolls on YouTube trying to create
64:39 a lot of you know view counts and steal
64:42 your money from pre-roll ads and that
64:44 kind of stuff
64:45 part of what validates the remote
64:48 viewing to me is sort of unsubstantiated
64:51 which are the claims that these projects
64:53 Stargate and all these other projects
64:55 created by a computer just you know
64:56 randomly associated words together that
64:58 they have been funded that they were put
65:02 together but let me throw something else
65:03 at you here I don't believe that
65:05 Stargate was ever announced to the
65:07 people but imagine that someone comes up
65:08 with this this project let's just maybe
65:12 even let's remote viewing slip out of
65:16 our spectrum here but they come up with
65:18 some project in the United States of
65:20 America some intelligence level thing
65:22 and they're able to convince someone at
65:23 the top this is legit or that we need to
65:26 at least explore it because the commies
65:28 are doing it yadda yadda yadda what
65:31 happens when that happens money is
65:34 allocated and once money is allocated
65:37 well then you can have a party can't you
65:39 as so as long as you can do what Elon
65:41 Musk does and says look over here look
65:43 over here I'm gonna make this I'm gonna
65:45 make that and nothing ever seems to be
65:46 profitable nothing ever seems to be real
65:49 tons of you know ventures tink but you
65:52 get to play with billions and billions
65:54 of dollars in the meantime and you get
65:55 to build up your own persona if you're
65:57 an Elon Musk doesn't even matter
66:00 you're a covert intelligence worker if
66:03 you can get the American public to
66:06 sponsor something or the selected
66:08 officials to sponsor something then you
66:11 get to have a party for 10 20 30 40
66:14 indefinite amount of years so that's a
66:17 cynical view of how covert projects of
66:20 this nature could be created and someone
66:27 like a Jim Marrs
66:28 could either be exposing the truth of
66:31 the talent which again I think we've
66:33 established on this particular show that
66:34 there is something to it
66:36 but if it was a fake and that research
66:40 came back you know like I think 23% is
66:42 random accuracy you know if I said if I
66:45 took a deck of cards and I flipped every
66:46 card up and you had to guess the suit or
66:48 the color or even the number you get
66:50 about 23 percent correct that's
66:53 randomness now I mentioned a long time
66:56 ago I'll just remind you that a friend I
66:58 work with a woman who was a manager at a
67:00 department and a company who worked in
67:02 the Bay Area Bay Area her daughter was
67:04 part of a Stanford experiment to see if
67:07 kids were psychic and according to her
67:10 it was definite yes and the older child
67:14 gets and the more they crushed their
67:16 brain with paradigms that the talent
67:18 goes away but the idea is to say you
67:20 know when you see a baby isn't it funny
67:23 how babies sort of barely have any
67:25 control over their body the only thing
67:27 they seem to be able to control outside
67:28 of the autonomic body mechanisms to eat
67:31 and excrete is they can kind of open
67:34 their eyes they can eat they can suck on
67:37 at it you know and that's sort of what
67:40 they're able to do but their bodies are
67:41 sort of Wiggly things right and if you
67:44 think about the current and the dye
67:46 going through the current from the
67:47 previous example think about the soul
67:50 merely infiltrating over the course of
67:54 six months the extremities of the vessel
67:58 that is the human body and so what we're
68:01 watching when we see a child wiggle as
68:03 it's been born is if the soul is really
68:06 penetrating the body and figuring out
68:08 where all the where all the pieces and
68:11 parts are now again the the body does
68:14 just stayed a baby for nine months but
68:16 perhaps in some form there's more of a
68:18 construction sequence going on until
68:21 birth you know let's say nine months we
68:23 generally consider a fetus having
68:26 developed everything the ears have moved
68:27 around the sex has been determined etc
68:30 etc and at that point you start becoming
68:32 who you are when you pop out whatever
68:37 the timetable that's currently my
68:40 thought about why babies aren't the
68:42 human babies are very slow to crawl even
68:47 six months is pretty quick walking my
68:49 kid walked in
68:50 nine months so she was a fast tracker
68:54 you know some kids don't get out of the
68:56 crib for two years some kids don't talk
68:58 for three years I mean it's really
68:59 interesting how the body infiltrates or
69:01 the soul infiltrates the body in my
69:03 opinion and there's no IQ related to
69:07 either one you could get up and walk at
69:08 six months and be the dumbest kid on
69:11 planet earth because it has to do with
69:12 conditioning and intelligence transfer
69:14 here on earth maybe genetically the
69:16 neural net and the brain is either more
69:18 detailed because the parents weren't
69:19 impressed educationally speaking so
69:22 there are genes create denser neural
69:25 mesh is in the brain has nothing with
69:27 race or anything you just has to deal
69:28 with oppression right so the genetic
69:30 curve learning curve is very real the
69:33 racial learning curve is not real unless
69:36 you add the metrics of oppression so you
69:40 can go to a ghetto and find a bunch of
69:41 dumb kids
69:42 but that's traced back to parents I
69:44 traced back culture trace back how the
69:46 parents might be really brilliant in the
69:47 ghetto but the kids turn out to be
69:49 stupid because of listening to music
69:51 that that makes them devoted to being
69:54 ignorant which is why we have to change
69:57 music we have to change art we have to
69:58 reinvent art for God's sakes just for
70:01 those of you don't live in Los Angeles
70:04 there's something called lowbrow art in
70:06 Los Angeles and they it's sort of the
70:10 edgy super-amazing artwork that's being
70:13 created in the world everything that
70:15 goes commercial that's sold in galleries
70:18 typically with you know names that
70:19 everybody knows those are more your
70:22 highbrow art but it's also sort of which
70:26 you might call classical music at that
70:27 point not bad very impressive stuff but
70:30 no one's writing new stuff besides
70:31 musical scores for movies
70:33 you're more alternate music is using
70:35 instruments in ways that have never been
70:37 you know thought of before remember the
70:39 electric guitar is less than a hundred
70:41 years old but now take out all the old
70:42 music that was created with electric
70:44 guitar a synthesizer you know all kinds
70:47 of instruments that didn't exist but
70:49 they're indicative of previous
70:50 inventions right now that your guitar
70:52 uses a guitar construct to to digitize
70:57 the data and do something special with
70:58 it so I think remote viewing is huge I
71:02 think the way the government uses
71:04 uses it as very sterile and probably
71:08 more related to nefarious objectives but
71:11 I think we all do it we all have done it
71:14 I think everyone who can hear my voice
71:15 has done it but you just didn't know you
71:19 were doing in and so what I want to
71:21 encourage you to do is your homework is
71:23 to one research your past go throughout
71:26 your past and think about these moments
71:27 when you've had epiphanies when you've
71:29 seen things you know I'm not talking
71:31 about you being suspicious of your lover
71:33 or sleeping with somebody else and you
71:35 think because you can see it vividly in
71:36 your brain is happening don't do that to
71:39 yourself all right let's keep it in the
71:41 fictional sense for a while until we
71:43 really get a grasp on what is real and
71:45 what isn't because the worst thing you
71:46 can do to any other human being is fill
71:49 up the gap when they're not there right
71:51 you imagine what someone is thinking
71:53 about you and it's completely incorrect
71:55 and so you sabotage your relationship by
71:57 being very you know submissive when you
72:00 don't need to that kind of thing right
72:02 try to remember when you've imagined
72:05 something that was creative in any way
72:07 shape or form and again I just want to
72:10 repeat this a few times throughout
72:12 episodes because you can repeat this to
72:14 yourself if you're this kind of person
72:15 or you can repeat it to someone you know
72:19 typically people who are easily scared
72:25 by movies television shows are people
72:29 that will often say they're not very
72:31 creative not always but a lot of times
72:34 they say they're not very creative and
72:35 the thing is is that their creativity is
72:38 off the chain they're able to see
72:40 they're able to fictionally move that
72:42 into their life and say oh my god I
72:45 watch Walking Dead so now I think
72:46 zombies are coming after me as if
72:49 there's any [ __ ] chance on the planet
72:51 Earth that that's just one and one in
72:53 the same it's absurd but they are the
72:57 creative ones that think they're not
72:59 creative and it's hobbling their ability
73:01 to watch you know Stanley Kubrick's
73:04 remake of our movie interpretation of
73:08 the shining by Stephen King so I think
73:11 that's about it if you have any comments
73:14 we might end up doing a second part on
73:15 this if I can find more
73:17 about it but I think that's a pretty
73:18 good ruff of the concept deep thoughts
73:26 radio calm for all the feeds there's
73:27 video and audio and a Facebook group
73:30 there's also patreon one of you guys is
73:33 stuck on there for about a $5 donation a
73:36 month which is super cool any monies
73:39 received from this you know go towards a
73:41 production of the show my my goal was to
73:44 create some sort of fun burst of cash
73:48 that we could put into the show to get
73:49 this camera to be 4k but you know it's
73:53 not paired if it'd just make things look
73:54 a little more crystal clear for those of
73:55 you like the video no sweat
73:58 I'm able to find the time to do this
74:00 sort of my weekends and sort of my lunch
74:03 break so it all works out great so
74:05 anyway take care of yourself and someone
74:07 else and I will see you in the next deep
74:09 thoughts over now
74:11 [Music]
74:33 it gives you these longitudinal led to
74:36 the well that was for you men
