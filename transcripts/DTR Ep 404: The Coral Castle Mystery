00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentlemen today finally we're gonna
00:35 cover Coral Castle now most of you
00:41 regulars sift on every single one of you
00:43 breckel theirs knows exactly what Coral
00:45 Castle is so what we're gonna do is
00:48 we're gonna bring everyone else up to
00:50 date as to what this is cover some of
00:52 the history just in case you've heard of
00:54 it you know what it is you've seen the
00:55 pictures but hey maybe forgot some of
00:57 the the actual dates of things we're
01:01 gonna talk about the fun stuff which is
01:04 how I think the place was built and
01:09 obviously the history is gonna butt up
01:12 against what actually took place so that
01:14 regardless if you believe my theory or
01:18 not you're gonna be able to at least
01:21 scratch your head and go well if it's
01:24 not his idea no one knows how they did
01:29 it so there was a man born in 1887 his
01:36 name was Edward leave Scotland something
01:41 like that it's Scotland and he was
01:46 Latvian moved to America after his
01:51 fiancee who was 16 years old the time
01:54 very common age for that timeframe sort
01:58 of left him at the altar and so one of
02:03 the objectives was a second I'm gonna
02:04 leave Latvia I'm gonna move to America
02:06 and I'm gonna build you a castle I'm
02:10 gonna send you photographs or whatever
02:12 letters about it and you will have
02:14 you'll be so impressed that you'll come
02:18 over and live with me and you know and
02:19 as you get cold feet or whatever but
02:21 i'ma do this right now here's what's
02:23 wild the dude comes over here they have
02:28 said several times he's about a
02:29 110-pound guy not a big dude plus he's
02:33 young he doesn't put any weight on right
02:36 he buys a little plot of land in some
02:39 unincorporated County in Florida place
02:44 called a Florida City and by 1923 he
02:51 opens what he calls EDS place it is a
02:57 sort of a boxed in yard if you will with
03:02 gigantic stones and what I recently
03:07 recently figured out was I have been
03:09 quoting this wrong the whole time
03:10 because the place is called Coral Castle
03:12 but it's not Coral not like coral reef
03:17 chunks or something like that this stuff
03:19 is actually something called Oh light it
03:24 is a form of limestone hmmm he had
03:32 limestone rocks that weighed up to 30
03:35 tons now some of the documentaries you
03:38 will see online about this have at least
03:41 a couple major stones at sixty tones or
03:45 above so I don't personally know I
03:47 haven't gone there I haven't weighed
03:48 anything so I don't know 30 is pretty
03:51 amazing okay
03:55 he opens this up for exhibit charges a
03:59 dime to get in and they always said he's
04:03 kind of a nice guy anyway if he didn't
04:04 have money he'd let she am be just like
04:06 don't tell anybody else sort of thing
04:08 you could ring this bell at the front
04:09 and he's just got his little crib it was
04:12 a little place and he'd come down and
04:13 and let she in he'd also sold pamphlets
04:17 when asked how he built a place he would
04:20 always say sweet 16 or he would say it's
04:24 not hard if you know how which I love
04:29 that idea
04:29 it was absolutely confirmed is that no
04:32 one saw him build this thing and the
04:37 story was is that and again I've heard
04:40 two different stories about this one was
04:44 that he would only work at night because
04:46 he said the Sun interfere with this
04:47 process which we're going to get into
04:50 the first story I heard about two
04:52 actually was three kids on bikes came
04:54 around the corner at night and said that
04:58 he was lifting the stones off the truck
05:02 this flatbed truck with these
05:04 cone-shaped things and there had been
05:07 pictures of of his workshop where he has
05:12 this crazy perpetual motor magnet thing
05:15 which we're going to get into that thing
05:16 and you see these things and they're
05:18 essentially like they it would be as if
05:21 the like sugar cones so their cone
05:23 shapes like the primitive shape and 3d
05:25 but where the ice cream would be as
05:27 where his hands are and they have a
05:29 little post that he can hang on with his
05:30 hands at least that's what I saw in the
05:33 photographs they could even be longer
05:35 I saw all kinds of wild things and so
05:39 these kids the first kids that I heard
05:41 and again I don't know what's true
05:43 obviously but they said they was lifting
05:45 them off the truck with these things now
05:49 the second story I heard was that two
05:51 kids same exact kind of stories said
05:54 that they the way that they described it
05:56 was that he was lifting them off the
05:58 truck like like balloons like hot-air
06:01 balloons so they were just floating the
06:07 other story was that he had these
06:10 workers bring him the stones and he
06:13 would make them go around the corner as
06:14 he took them off the truck you wonder
06:17 you didn't when it didn't want anyone
06:19 seeing how he did it very fascinating so
06:24 if that isn't impressive enough what he
06:25 does is in 1936 he picks the place up
06:29 and moves it supposedly he actually
06:33 purchased somewhere around 10 acres of
06:34 land and so he had land he didn't use
06:37 and when he died which we'll get into he
06:40 well he ran it until 1951 he wasn't
06:46 feeling very well and he put a sign on
06:48 the front saying you know gone to the
06:50 hospital on the way to the hospital he
06:53 has a stroke and he dies later not too
06:58 much later of a kidney malfunction his
07:02 kidneys were working
07:05 but he moved this place to what is
07:08 technically on the address book as Miami
07:11 Florida so that's where it should be
07:14 today okay but he picked this thing up
07:18 and moved it it's sort of like you know
07:22 the Egyptians they built these three big
07:24 pyramids and you know any kind of
07:26 thought I it's not quite the right
07:28 scenic things I just picked it up and
07:30 moved it if anybody ever told you that
07:32 your mind would be blown right you know
07:34 they weren't really here at first they
07:36 were over there um you know Stonehenge
07:37 was moved and completely reconstructed
07:39 in 1954 and then they lied to you that
07:41 it was actually built right where you
07:43 see it unfortunately his sweetheart
07:47 Agnes never moved from Latvia he even
07:51 made a place supposedly for his
07:53 mother-in-law to make sure that the
07:54 whole thing was copacetic and cool but
07:58 for whatever reason she didn't move over
08:00 there now one of the other things he's
08:03 quoted as saying other than sweet 16 as
08:06 to the reason how a reason the
08:09 methodology of which he figured out how
08:10 to do this and the answer of if you know
08:13 how to do it it's not too hard he was
08:16 quoted as saying I figured out how the
08:18 pyramids were built and that's what I
08:21 used to make this thing happen
08:22 now technically if you look at a lot of
08:25 the photographs of the way that he put
08:29 this together one you have to listen to
08:32 the fact that he never took the rocks
08:34 off of the truck during the day
08:36 complaining that the essentially the
08:38 photons from the Sun that verbal
08:41 reaction of ether wind messed up his
08:44 technique probably I don't know I get
08:48 the sense that he could have worked but
08:49 he it was just you know you're moving 30
08:53 ton rocks you don't to slip and drop it
08:55 on your foot right but it would only
08:57 work at night for the actual bulk moving
09:00 of these rocks and then you have the
09:03 people that can't accept that he could
09:05 could have created a perpetual motor
09:07 built out of magnets which we're gonna
09:09 get to and the fact that the Sun a
09:11 ten-pound guy can move all these rocks
09:12 into place and so they take the daytime
09:15 shots and say see it's super simple how
09:17 we did
09:17 see did pulleys and big thick 10 by 10
09:23 you know pylons to just hoist it into
09:27 place okay never a picture of the truck
09:32 being unloaded during the day never a
09:34 picture of this pulley system over the
09:37 truck which would have to be utterly
09:38 massive to back the truck in with the
09:40 stone on the back to get it into the pit
09:43 where he's going to line it up set it up
09:45 make it happen
09:47 so that whole thing of uh was all
09:50 pulleys and it's all [ __ ]
09:51 okay if it's all pulleys guys if it's
09:55 just that freaking easy then why are
09:58 they still trying to figure how the
09:59 pyramids were built all that means is
10:01 the Egyptians used police and you just
10:04 can't find the police because it's so
10:06 easy everybody has a court will cast are
10:09 in the backyard why cuz they they went
10:10 to Home Depot and got some pulleys and
10:12 some rope knock yourself out guys show
10:15 me your Coral Castle show me your 30-ton
10:18 rocks you don't have one because that
10:23 wimpy way of moving out of science and
10:27 moving out of something miraculous is
10:31 the way the cowards work we grant it if
10:35 there was four or five of these things
10:36 around here and you know JimBob does it
10:38 and Webster the nerd does it then hey
10:42 man I'll totally surrender yeah wow I
10:43 didn't know why did it take so long for
10:45 everyone to figure this out
10:47 so let's get into how he did it now the
10:52 one interesting thing is that he said
10:55 supposedly that he figured out how the
10:57 pyramids were made and that's how he did
10:58 Coral Castle the thing that always
11:02 confused me until if I did this massive
11:03 deep dive to do this episode was I
11:07 thought is there some similarity between
11:08 coral and limestone because the
11:12 Egyptians were doing magic with
11:13 limestone the answer is it wasn't coral
11:19 it was Oh light and it is a limestone
11:21 derivative perfect this technique I
11:27 don't know if it works in any other type
11:29 of rock but it definitely works for
11:31 stone we've got some visual proof of it
11:34 we'd love to hear it
11:36 and different types of rock but I've
11:38 also seen in the last six months several
11:42 specials on other pyramids all around
11:43 the world and limestone is the central
11:46 rock granite is used every once while
11:48 but it's almost used as an inlaid accent
11:51 to the coral are sorry to the limestone
11:54 superstructure so what else did mr.
12:00 Edward have on his little lot in either
12:06 Florida City or Miami Florida
12:10 he had a magnetic flywheel and I'm going
12:14 to show you tons of pictures of this
12:16 thing there are great websites out there
12:18 for you to explore this but for people
12:21 to say there's another one of these just
12:24 pieces of proof that people are super
12:27 lazy with their brains to say access
12:30 parties and ropes and pieces of wood
12:33 then what the hell is the magnetic
12:35 flywheel for there boy what is it
12:38 flyboy right this is a magnetic wheel
12:43 with 16 individual stacks of magnets
12:48 that when you total the whole thing up
12:53 it has a hundred and twenty distinct
12:56 magnets that are all lined up in there
12:58 another orientations where they're poles
13:00 are not quite sure never touched it
13:03 never did any you know metal shavings
13:08 test on this thing be interesting to
13:10 find out their polarity but this
13:13 flywheel is really fascinating it has an
13:17 inner crank in it it's sort of this off
13:20 center crank that sort of goes around
13:23 almost like a was it spiral graph when
13:29 you were a kid like an inner sprocket in
13:31 there and I have watched this is gonna
13:36 sound absurd but I have watched I think
13:38 a 15 hour 15 segment somewhere in there
13:42 YouTube special work kid
13:45 who seemed to be very versed in
13:47 mathematics tried to parse this thing
13:49 and it is a rabbit hole that makes Alice
13:57 in Wonderland look like child's play he
14:02 works with something I believe it's
14:04 called quadratic prime numbers and
14:09 essentially what this wheel does is it
14:11 creates a power source with a little bit
14:15 of energy put in it puts a massive
14:17 amount of energy out and somehow it can
14:21 charge up these tools that he was using
14:23 such that it maintained like a capacitor
14:26 this magnetic field of which then he
14:29 could use to move the rocks into place
14:31 at least the the core cores movements
14:35 now he did use pulleys and wood to do
14:37 fine adjustments straighten him out he
14:39 carved on some of them he made one of
14:42 them look like the planet of Saturn he
14:45 made one of them look like a crescent
14:47 moon he built himself a chair that was
14:50 perfectly balanced he built a gigantic
14:52 door that you could push with one finger
14:56 now all that had been done before
14:59 especially in Egypt but balanced the
15:02 doors and what stuff he just recreated
15:04 he just proved that he had it figured
15:06 out which is cool I mean if you built
15:09 the Saturn five in your backyard
15:10 it wouldn't be unimpressive just because
15:12 it was done before right his location is
15:19 packed
15:20 utterly packed with the clues of how he
15:23 built this all the mathematics he used
15:25 to create his flywheel to work with the
15:30 environment which obviously he said
15:32 again could compete with him if he
15:35 worked during the day during the course
15:37 movements he has a water fountain that
15:42 has this sine cosine wave in it that's
15:45 part of the clue where you put your ten
15:47 cents back in 1923 was inside of the
15:52 bottom part of the Star of David
15:56 when he moved at 1936 he ended up
15:59 charging 25 cents which is where he
16:01 really had to kind of let people in for
16:03 free every once in a while talking about
16:05 the middle of the depression they said
16:09 that when he died in 1951 he about
16:13 thirty six hundred dollars in cash in
16:15 his little Hut he didn't have a will so
16:17 the state had to will it to one of his
16:20 kind of estranged nephews in Michigan
16:23 who was also not well and ended up
16:26 selling it very quickly to another
16:27 family who ended up selling it to a
16:29 corporation and they've maintained it I
16:32 think since about 1984
16:34 I think someone paid about $175,000 for
16:38 the place what a good deal that was a
16:40 lot of money in 84 huge I mean a
16:44 Corvette costs ninety five hundred bucks
16:48 you know it's like a house cost twenty
16:50 five thousand fifty grand so it was huge
16:56 someone recognized the value of this
16:59 place is being phenomenal he also is the
17:02 gentleman that wrote the paper on
17:04 magnetism which I have in my computer a
17:09 lot of it is just basic understanding of
17:12 magnetism but a few of his opening
17:16 phrases a few of his areas are very
17:19 interesting he is the gentleman that
17:21 said you have been lied to your whole
17:23 life about the construction and Anatomy
17:26 of an atom he said that the center of an
17:29 atom is a photon a photon is a verb and
17:34 not a noun a photon is like saying is
17:37 made of the ripples on the surface of a
17:41 body of water not the water itself what
17:45 else behaves like a verb ether whether
17:51 ether be oh I think either is a particle
17:53 but even if it isn't it's in constant
17:56 movement it's constantly flowing and if
17:59 you think about it everything that
18:00 exists has to be renewed second to
18:03 second you'll see all my episodes on
18:05 ether so what he was trying to tell you
18:08 is is that
18:09 all mass flows it doesn't just flow
18:13 within its own little orbital loops it
18:16 flows from the outside through and out
18:19 again like the spiral in a water like a
18:22 little tornado in a water drain you say
18:25 that's a little vortex that's a tornado
18:28 but someone else over your shoulder goes
18:30 well it's actually just water behaving
18:32 like that you're giving it that name
18:34 because it's behaving like that that's
18:36 what he's trying to tell you is that the
18:38 atom as a behavior and it's a bunch of
18:41 tight loops of spins that create the
18:45 electron well sorry I should say first
18:47 the proton the neutron and the electron
18:50 cloud for those of you knew the
18:54 dielectric wave is the ricocheting ether
18:56 the magnetism wave is the orbital ether
18:59 and when they hit each other they make
19:00 the cloud of electromagnetism ether is
19:05 what creates gravity if two bodies are
19:09 getting closer and closer to each other
19:11 there's a bit of a negative pressure
19:13 between them there's not so much ether
19:15 flowing just like water that's flowing
19:18 if it's flowing really quickly right
19:20 there's always a negative pressure
19:22 between objects it's how a wing works it
19:24 distorts wind as it goes through it
19:27 oxygen cuts the liquid and it creates a
19:30 less pressure above then there is below
19:33 and you get lift it's just that simple
19:35 you're with your loved one in the middle
19:38 of a windy day 100 feet away you don't
19:41 feel anything you feel all that chaotic
19:43 wind on your chest same as you feel it
19:44 on your back you guys get in with one
19:46 inch with within one inch of each other
19:48 their backs blocking your chest your
19:51 backs blocking their chest and there's
19:53 less pressure between you if you didn't
19:55 have the the ground below you you incan
19:58 you down you would be pulled together
20:01 that's how ether works they knew this
20:03 many many many centuries ago and they
20:06 just squashed it because if you did know
20:08 that then you would know perpetual
20:10 engines are possible you would buy
20:12 packets of power from power companies
20:14 and Tesla would have been God on earth
20:16 but here's the key I believe to this
20:20 whole thing it's actually not that
20:22 complicated
20:23 I hope I can make it to an hour because
20:26 this is so simple my opinion why am I
20:29 being pushed to the surface of this
20:33 patio because ether all winds are
20:38 hitting me on the top of my head no
20:40 ether winds are hitting me from below of
20:43 any significance the why because the
20:45 earth is this big giant plasma ball
20:47 covered in a dry crust that we call the
20:50 surface of the earth and so all of the
20:53 plasma there's on the other side of the
20:54 world that would be pushing me up and
20:56 making me float in space is being
20:58 blocked the bigger the object bigger the
21:01 plasma interior the more the obstruction
21:03 hints more gravity the moon has less
21:07 gravity than us because it's diameter
21:09 smaller the Sun has a hell of a lot more
21:11 gravity because its diameter is way
21:13 bigger than ours this is how the whole
21:15 thing works
21:16 ah so that's why these Oh light stones
21:22 these limestone's that he used to build
21:24 Coral Castle flying quotes were so heavy
21:28 that's how we know they weigh 30 tons 20
21:30 tons ten tons etc same thing with the
21:33 pyramid stones that's why I can't go
21:38 over there and pick them up with one
21:39 hand mm-hmm well what if someone through
21:45 sheer either serendipity meaning pure
21:48 luck or careful experimentation what if
21:54 they somehow stimulated a rock with
22:01 electricity maybe a natural Foundry a
22:06 plasma coming out of the Earth's core
22:08 through a aqua ravine maybe a bunch of
22:12 limestone simply got stacked up and
22:14 there the conductive limestone and they
22:18 started you know zapping people's
22:19 fingers and start people started
22:20 discovering electricity can congregate
22:23 inside these particular types of rock
22:25 and through an experimentation of
22:29 putting a certain frequency inside that
22:32 rock a sacred geometry pattern
22:36 electricity just a frequency how many
22:40 people have used have seen those tests
22:42 where they have the the black piece of
22:43 paper and they put it on a speaker you
22:45 put salt on it and they played tones of
22:48 a keyboard and you see these beautiful
22:50 patterns change and you like oh my god
22:54 that's amazing you can do it with water
22:57 water is flowing your beam sound at it
23:00 creates a little corkscrew creates
23:02 almost creates an effect like it's going
23:04 back up it's not it's just an illusion
23:07 hmm we see this all the time there's the
23:11 liquid metal experiments same thing get
23:15 up with the frequency crazies crazy
23:17 spiky balls and all kinds of wild shapes
23:20 right all right what if as the normal
23:27 configuration of resting orbital matter
23:30 which is limestone you know there's more
23:35 space between these things they call
23:39 atoms which is sort of like this this
23:42 little party going on of ether a
23:44 particles right they found each other
23:45 they went through these very standard
23:48 orbital patterns
23:49 that's just it just it's what happens
23:51 with either when you crowd it up starts
23:53 to do these things when they start to
23:54 spend at a certain diameter when the
23:57 little spiral accounts for a certain
23:59 amount of ether it's called a proton
24:03 when it spins one way it's considered
24:05 positive when it spins the other way
24:06 it's considered negative maybe there's
24:08 one or it's so chaotic li spends they
24:11 call it a neutron it's just completely
24:13 neutral it's like when you look at a
24:16 wheel when it's driving down the highway
24:19 and you are a little kid and you didn't
24:20 have to drive you look out and you look
24:22 at the wheel and it it's moving for
24:23 moving forward and then there's that
24:25 sweet spot where the frame rate legs
24:28 look like it's going backwards maybe
24:30 something like that but with a bunch of
24:35 space between these atoms what if you
24:37 could get them all to vibrate in such a
24:40 way that the holes start to appear space
24:46 starts to appear it's like liquid
24:48 crystal if you guys know how the good
24:49 crystal work
24:50 but what you do with liquid crystal is
24:53 you have these little shavings that are
24:54 the kind of like a finger shape right
24:57 and when they're swimming around it
25:00 blocks the black back color there's like
25:07 a little black plate and then they pour
25:08 this liquid crystal on it and it just
25:09 swims around swims around that's when it
25:11 looks milky and so that weird green back
25:14 in the day a light green and then all of
25:16 a sudden the number shows up and you see
25:18 black and that's because there's a
25:19 electrical field in the shape of the
25:22 character that makes those swimming
25:25 particles go straight up and down and so
25:27 now you look down into your watch and
25:29 you could see the background which was
25:31 black that's all the crystal used to
25:34 work back in the day that's all over the
25:37 place we're talking about Windows now
25:38 they sell in your house where as long as
25:41 it's not electrified it's opaque you
25:43 can't see through the window but if you
25:45 want to see through it you run a little
25:46 bit of voltage through the glass there's
25:48 some wires that are so small you can't
25:50 see them like your cell phone and boom
25:51 you can see through the glass because
25:53 all those little shards went straight so
25:56 take the principle of liquid crystal
25:58 chaotic swimming ether that is the
26:01 limestone gets somehow unified unified
26:06 enough that the ether all winds that are
26:08 pushing down on the rock like they're
26:10 pushing down on my head right now and
26:11 everything you can see in this backyard
26:13 everything I can see that you can't see
26:16 it starts to become permeable it it's
26:22 flowing through the object you don't
26:26 want to do it too much because you don't
26:27 want the thing to fly into space right
26:29 just become zero-g and flat into space
26:31 if you had this flywheel
26:33 back in the back room and you have these
26:35 wires that come out to these cone things
26:37 and there's some ritual that we have no
26:40 clue what the ritual is it could be he
26:43 hooks electrodes to one side the other
26:45 side and the sacred geometry pattern
26:47 crawls across the rock thus freeing it
26:51 from the push impact the collision
26:54 doesn't happen as often
26:57 he juices it up he's got a little bit of
27:00 math in his brain how much to push that
27:02 algorithm into the stone
27:03 and now the freaking things float he
27:09 moves him around the corner he puts him
27:13 generally where he wants them for the
27:15 next day perhaps he's already I mean
27:16 hopefully he's already dug a little
27:17 trench to hold them but he pushes him in
27:20 there generally where he wants them and
27:22 now the pulleys and the wood are gonna
27:26 provide the basic mechanism to move him
27:28 into place the next day however there's
27:30 a hitch with that if you watch the
27:31 photographs which I'm gonna show look at
27:33 them you can watch him too I guess
27:35 you're gonna see that there's a box on
27:38 top of his little tripods that he
27:40 creates now it still is a bit of a
27:43 mystery to me and I want to mention
27:44 something about this box I'm sorry about
27:48 this flywheel I think this is real
27:52 there's a relief hieroglyph it looks
27:57 Babylonian to be of what appears to be
28:01 the flywheel with the sixteen teeth on
28:04 it because you can only see one half of
28:05 it right so you see eight of these
28:07 little notches it looks exactly like his
28:11 apparatus and it and you would think
28:15 that perhaps Europe in Latvia
28:18 you know Tesla came over from Serbia or
28:24 Croatia or something like that right he
28:26 came over and he had AC figured out he
28:29 seemed to have a lot of things figured
28:31 out but this dude Edward he seemed to
28:36 have access to this information imagine
28:38 you just got an old guy in your village
28:40 he was an old basin
28:41 really high in Mason this information
28:43 has been passed down for years how to
28:45 build this thing
28:45 he built ones in Latin he builds one in
28:48 Lafayette oh my God we're gonna has a
28:49 lot of fun we get to America he should
28:53 have shown his girlfriend the trick that
28:55 would have been the thing
28:55 sixteen-year-old girl like watch someone
28:57 take a 30-ton rock and move it around
28:59 right in front of you in the moonlight
29:01 right here or whatever it looks like
29:04 this wheel unless the hieroglyph is fake
29:07 which no no it looks pretty real to me
29:10 when I look at it but again everybody
29:12 can do things now that will blow your
29:14 mind
29:15 but it looks like this wheel has a major
29:17 hit
29:17 street to it and he was able to build it
29:20 we see it Lots pictures of it and it his
29:26 ability to capacitate the energy is what
29:28 is the mystery to me personally so let's
29:30 say he's spending this flywheel and all
29:32 this amazing electricity is going on
29:34 maybe the wheel itself capacitated it in
29:37 a field around it you would almost think
29:39 it'd be dangerous to be around it but it
29:41 can't be because it's got this hand
29:42 crank in the center
29:44 maybe the rods that he had all over this
29:48 room which look really kooky I mean they
29:51 don't look like things that they're not
29:52 levers or leave us as they might say in
29:55 other parts of the world didn't look
29:57 like it was part of the game
29:58 I mean I'm normal sorry it didn't look
30:01 like it was part of any like get this
30:03 thing into place kind of tools it looked
30:05 like they were very specific for some
30:06 other reason and you know I grew up in
30:09 Kansas with old barns with crap in it
30:12 that are over 100 years old old you know
30:15 automotive garages had been there for 80
30:18 years
30:18 you know they had fixed Model T's when I
30:21 was you know before I was born never saw
30:24 this stuff before so we have the Mexican
30:29 workers telling us the stories of him
30:32 them dropping off the stones he makes
30:34 him go around the corner he pulls him
30:35 down
30:35 they leave and then he pulls him around
30:37 the corner the kids who saw him moving
30:39 these things like they were balloons big
30:42 giant stones floating in the air what
30:43 else weather analogy is this kid gonna
30:45 put together I think that's actually a
30:47 beautiful little descriptor for our
30:50 brains so that part is unfotunately
31:01 ether by using electricity
31:03 electromagnetism and it might be just a
31:07 little parlor trick that works with
31:08 limestone and nothing else it actually
31:12 warmed my heart when I realized this
31:13 stuff was a derivative of limestone and
31:15 not coral because coral I don't know
31:17 anything about it or anything about its
31:18 composition not that I have a huge
31:20 library of limestone
31:22 you know geography and my brain but now
31:27 it's the next day the photographs
31:30 in every single picture that I've ever
31:34 seen it looks to me it's hard to
31:38 approximate this it was either a 10 by
31:41 10 tripod a big lumber or maybe even a
31:46 12 by 12 because this is big it does
31:50 have a pulley
31:50 it does have ropes but there's the box
31:54 on top with the wires sit seemingly and
31:57 many of the photos go down to the stone
31:59 and ones going off to his wheel hey what
32:03 would wires be for red wires not good
32:05 wires on their own are not going to pull
32:06 this thing into place so it seems like
32:09 he is connecting electricity to the
32:11 stone and that's where I got the entire
32:13 idea that I just shared with you so
32:16 let's say he needs to move it in a
32:19 bigger way than the pulley systems going
32:21 to afford his you know dreams and
32:24 aspirations as to what he's building
32:26 here and he did have assistance during
32:29 the day I believe I've seen people help
32:31 him with this part but I'll have to go
32:33 review that but I believe I've seen a
32:35 couple workers helping him with the
32:37 fine-tuning of the rock and that's fine
32:40 that doesn't break any of the mystery
32:41 but imagine him going re I take five he
32:45 goes on that wheel and also in the Box
32:48 gets electricity here comes the
32:49 frequency it's all specifically dialed
32:52 in for this whole thing it might be that
32:53 the wheel itself works with limestone it
32:56 does this thing or maybe you know nerely
32:58 would have to have some sort of
32:59 modulating circuit inside the box if
33:03 he's gonna change it maybe that's part
33:06 of the ecosystem of the of the first
33:09 process who knows right and then all the
33:13 sudden the rock is a little bit lighter
33:15 mighty be able to move it by himself
33:17 while these guys are on lunch
33:19 there's no stories about that that I
33:21 know of the big the big sign that this
33:27 is something super duper special is that
33:33 he moved the place he moved it in 1936 I
33:39 mean I'm sure it took him a little while
33:40 there's not a lot of statistics and data
33:42 on how long it took him to move it
33:44 but imagine that I don't know what the
33:47 total tonnage is of all the rocks that
33:49 he put in place but considering the
33:52 rocks range from 10 to 30 tons and this
33:56 is like a fortress it's like a mini
33:58 little fortress I'm sure if you're in it
33:59 it's not as big as it feels and online
34:02 or whatever but it is a tremendous
34:05 amount of work even with magic it's a
34:10 tremendous amount of work to get this
34:12 thing put in place to carve all these
34:14 things because he was telling a story
34:15 the guy was ingenious he created a
34:17 three-dimensional experience inside this
34:19 place where he's giving you all the
34:22 clues of how this works and I would hope
34:26 and pray that someone hasn't gone in and
34:30 modified the original design to take out
34:32 like one piece of the clue that if we
34:34 had this other piece of rock we know the
34:35 whole solution I don't know about that
34:37 there are a lot of websites out there
34:39 theorizing how it's done I've seen whole
34:40 websites about the pulley theory which
34:42 is just absurd again if if the pulleys
34:46 work then you could just go to Egypt and
34:47 go oh yeah these pulleys and this whole
34:50 thing will just build one and then when
34:51 they they task these guys to build
34:53 little mini pyramids with the tools that
34:56 were available back in those days they
34:58 just give up but the guy picked the
35:02 place up and he moved it it just imagine
35:06 just imagine his house next to me here
35:09 coral castles a hell of a lot bigger in
35:11 this house all right let's say that I
35:15 you know I'm a really good craftsman I
35:17 got buddies of mine in Kansas who do
35:19 this kind of stuff they build houses
35:21 like this but know three or four stories
35:23 basements amazing craftsmen right I
35:25 don't think any of them have thought I
35:27 mean this does happen here one small but
35:30 I don't think idiom go you know I'm I
35:32 think I'm gonna buy a lot down the
35:33 street and I'm not gonna build another
35:35 house I'll just pick up my house and
35:36 move it down the street I have seen that
35:39 done a few times but it's it's a super
35:42 weird rare thing and I think the
35:44 integrity of the home is pretty
35:45 compromised by the time it gets lifted
35:46 up and moved maybe some of you can chime
35:50 in the physics of that and the integrity
35:54 of that
35:55 I would love to have the information
35:56 about the steps in which he took to move
35:59 it because we don't have that as far as
36:02 I know which means it probably didn't
36:06 need a lot of help he just needed the
36:08 vehicles now I don't know if the
36:12 gigantic documentary I saw which was
36:14 talking about these very special prime
36:16 number sequences were essentially what
36:19 they said was there was there are prime
36:21 numbers there are points in the number
36:23 set where you will have like four prime
36:26 numbers in a row and it's almost it's
36:27 like an almost an impossibility that
36:30 this happens and I would you know I
36:32 watched this in a scene it makes sense
36:33 to me at the time but I will tell you my
36:35 brain hurt badly after I watched
36:39 probably 10 hours of this thing because
36:42 the guy gives you the sense he's going
36:44 to actually solve the mystery and he
36:47 never does after like 14 hours or so you
36:49 start to realize these petering off into
36:51 other theories but one of the things he
36:53 does it's very interesting is the Star
36:57 of David is a very fascinating structure
37:01 is part of the Saturn worship because
37:04 there's a cube there's a
37:06 three-dimensional cube in the center of
37:07 the Star of David and it has you know
37:10 it's been adopted as a Zionist symbol of
37:12 banking but and the Jewish flag of
37:14 Israel but it's way way older than any
37:17 of that stuff that's a recent usurp chin
37:21 of the symbol and it's fine that's their
37:24 thing whatever but what this guy did was
37:27 he went in he started realizing that
37:30 Masonic temples I think there's one in
37:34 Boston he snuck into her maybe it was
37:35 New York one of the two he went into one
37:38 of these and my god the the doors of
37:43 these Masonic temples now you have to
37:45 understand that in Egyptian there in
37:48 Egypt back in the day if you go look at
37:50 any of the doors to temples and either
37:52 doors than anything in Egypt they were
37:54 sacred passages they didn't think doors
37:57 were just some basic thing they always
38:00 had usually like this wing you draw
38:02 across the top and it was a portal into
38:05 a different conscious
38:08 this realm dimension whatever but the
38:14 guys started going into these Masonic
38:15 temples and taking pictures of doors and
38:19 there was this really interesting thing
38:22 every door has a door jamb around it in
38:24 most places in the world because it
38:25 holds all the the different junctions of
38:29 timber or stone that brings it all
38:32 together right so if it's a little
38:33 veneer around all that bad you know
38:36 joint äj-- it's a super scientific word
38:41 but inside a Masonic Temple you will
38:45 have the Star of David over the center
38:48 of a door at least one of the doors to
38:50 the room if not all the doors have the
38:52 Star of David well if you go look at the
38:55 start of Dave and I'll put some
38:56 photographs up there the lower part of
38:59 the star is a triangle it's clipped off
39:02 and it's a triangle and they
39:04 specifically put the triangle below the
39:07 edge of the mantle that is the door jamb
39:11 top now when you donated your dime or
39:16 your 25 cents into this of this park or
39:21 at the very beginning of Coral Castle he
39:24 had a Star of David on the stone that he
39:28 had put together and you put your dime
39:31 in that little triangle down below and
39:35 people thought that that was him giving
39:38 you a clue of putting a unit of ten into
39:42 his equation somehow I don't know you
39:46 know it seems kind of strange I think he
39:47 probably felt inflation and put it to 25
39:50 but it was a dime initially and so the
39:53 the person that put together this really
39:56 long series was really getting into the
39:59 mathematics of not only the flywheel and
40:01 how it worked but this dime that you put
40:04 at the bottom the fountain with the
40:09 sequences of numbers in it and the time
40:11 of day was super duper interesting
40:14 because this was put in a place where
40:16 the shadow sort of like a an old clock
40:19 the old
40:22 a sundial type clock right would cast
40:26 shadows inside this little birdbath or
40:29 whatever the heck it was he was trying
40:31 to track the numbers there now I wish I
40:34 could give you the solution in this
40:36 video as to what this guy was doing
40:38 whether or not the relevance is there
40:40 I'm pretty convinced that some
40:43 derivative of what I've given you is
40:46 what the guy did he made these rocks I
40:49 think I bought put this way I think that
40:52 there's enough evidence I witness
40:53 evidence and factual evidence that the
40:57 place was built that he used some method
41:01 to make the rocks weightless you know
41:03 virtually I mean floating in the air
41:06 extremely interesting right now usually
41:12 if someone helps I mean let's go the
41:16 opposite theory that all of this is just
41:19 sensationalized lies and bla bla bla bla
41:22 ok here's your challenge with that let's
41:27 say that Disneyland from 1954 to 1955
41:32 during its construction year in
41:33 California eight and a half miles from
41:35 where I'm sitting let's say that Walt
41:40 crafted this story like this édouard guy
41:43 can't say his last name worth of damage
41:46 so I'm not gonna abuse it but this Park
41:49 just magically appears is sort of the
41:51 storyline but what really took place was
41:55 thousands of workers working to clear
41:57 the land helped build all these rides
41:59 seeing out work work work work work
42:02 Bob Gers documenting it he's designing
42:04 propulsion systems all this other stuff
42:06 right it's all secret because they want
42:09 you to believe this place magically
42:11 appeared that's part of the I'm making
42:13 this up this isn't a story but in order
42:15 to make you know there's no more of a
42:17 miracle
42:17 it just goes POW and it's there all
42:20 right that didn't happen but if it did
42:24 all right so after the debut of
42:29 Disneyland in 1955 Walt dies 10 years
42:33 later
42:34 he only sees that place for ten years
42:37 okay how many people would hold the
42:41 secret forever that they did that they
42:43 worked on it that it wasn't magically
42:45 delicious like it didn't magically
42:47 appear one night some would a bunch
42:52 wouldn't especially if somebody paid
42:54 them to prove that that's what they did
42:57 you know they're missing from their
42:58 family they go to work they show their
43:00 pay stubs they prove that they worked
43:02 there and the hoax is unraveled and
43:05 exposed and a little bit of the magic
43:07 disappears okay so where are all these
43:12 people that truly if if he didn't take
43:16 these things off by himself 110 pound
43:19 guy moving 30 ton stones off of a back
43:21 of a truck
43:21 one by one right a new shipment there's
43:25 one stone on that thing moves it off
43:27 another one one stone moves it off right
43:29 trucks can hold a whole hell of a lot
43:31 right it's 1923 when he opened the first
43:33 one you know I mean 23 how long was the
43:37 Model T around for a Model T debuted in
43:40 what 1915 or something like that
43:42 I don't quote me on that but I mean
43:44 there wasn't that much sophistication in
43:47 23 did they build big things yeah sure
43:51 but we're talking about Empire State
43:53 Building timeframes where the base of
43:57 the building is like what 20 feet thick
43:59 or something I mean is because it
44:01 doesn't have all the girder
44:02 reinforcements that we have today the
44:05 cantilever technology the the technology
44:09 keeps it from falling over during an
44:11 earthquake I mean you know these were
44:12 old structures built the old-fashioned
44:14 way and he's in that era okay I just
44:19 looked that up the entire state building
44:21 was finished in 1931 so say it took ten
44:25 years to build he's literally building
44:27 us at the same time the Empire State
44:28 building's been building but he's one
44:31 guy 110 pounds how much money would it
44:34 take to pay all these people to help him
44:36 I mean he's finished in 23 so he's
44:40 building this what first I don't know
44:41 three or four years he came from Latvia
44:45 how much money do you have saved up to
44:46 just have all these workers
44:48 and amount of mean I don't know
44:49 supposedly got the stones really cheap
44:51 because there was a lot of construction
44:53 and quarry work making room for other
44:56 things leveling out land so it was a
44:59 disposal process for the construction
45:02 companies that were digging these
45:03 limestone's out giving it to him you
45:06 know it's like hey you want some trash
45:08 sure you go boom we never see you later
45:10 man I don't think this was some simple
45:15 little thing if it if it was I would
45:20 imagine that you know an engineering
45:21 college in Florida in Miami Florida
45:24 probably have a really good engineering
45:25 school UC Irvine
45:27 down the street but if we had a coral
45:31 castle right here in Huntington Beach
45:33 and it was a big mystery as to how this
45:36 was built I would imagine that some
45:37 professor over the course of 50 years
45:40 would go yeah I'm gonna do III see this
45:43 all in my head it's all pulleys and
45:45 whatever I'm gonna you know this guy's
45:48 maybe like 130 pounds right I did 10
45:51 pounds it's not much right he's like I'm
45:54 gonna prove it to you we're gonna pull a
45:56 truck up with a 30 ton stone and this
45:59 professor is gonna just hook up some
46:01 pulleys cuz that's super simple and I'm
46:05 gonna yank all these stones off and I'm
46:06 gonna put them all in place by myself
46:08 carve him up whatever why there's in a
46:11 box with electrical wires coming out the
46:13 top of it mmm I don't know why is that
46:16 you keep his lunch in there the wires
46:19 just I don't know for decoration and
46:21 what's up at the flywheel right what's
46:26 up at the flywheel if this is the big
46:29 debunked it's only a bunch of pulleys
46:30 then why did he have a flywheel what was
46:33 that whole thing about why do you have
46:35 all these weird tools in his shed he was
46:38 just the next century he's playing
46:40 around with this this magnetic flywheel
46:44 that was his little hobby and he just
46:47 happened to build Coral Castle and moved
46:50 it by himself
46:56 here's what I love about this story
47:00 there's this little pocket where Tesla
47:03 in 1923 has already kicked so much ass
47:07 in this world it's unbelievable right he
47:10 did
47:11 he kicked mega ass all right Einstein he
47:17 debuted his first stolen paper in 1905
47:20 he does another stolen paper around 1915
47:24 he's in 1929 he gets his photoelectric
47:28 Nobel Prize it doesn't have the
47:30 intellectual capacity to explain it
47:32 every time he tried to explain his Nobel
47:35 patent which he shared with two other
47:36 guys that I should had all the work they
47:38 said well he seems to miss the complete
47:40 concept of his patent every time he
47:42 speaks he's missing the the core factors
47:45 of how this photoelectric effect works
47:49 okay so if you really know the history
47:52 of science back in this little envelope
47:55 of time one Edward is looking at Tesla
48:00 he's looking at all the scientists that
48:02 are being worshipped between Tesla and
48:04 Faraday which is almond volts at all
48:07 these guys at a bunch of unnamed
48:08 geniuses that we never mentioned on the
48:11 show the dudes probably not worried he's
48:15 okay the winning team is winning the
48:18 right team is winning the understanding
48:20 of the of the universe is still very
48:23 palatable and being taught to kids again
48:27 Tesla called Einstein absolute hack over
48:32 and over and over again explicitly
48:34 writing that when Einstein got rid of
48:38 theater theories of ether Tesla said
48:40 look everything that I make is based on
48:42 ether existing that's why I create
48:45 things that people use and we're using
48:47 all Tesla stuff right now alternating
48:50 current and wireless technology among
48:52 other things again some of you've seen
48:56 my ether episodes recently because
48:58 you're development centers this is going
48:59 to bore you a little bit a little bit of
49:01 a repeat Tesla's laboratory was said to
49:05 have no wires by Mark Twain who went
49:08 there like I don't know
49:09 I've read all kinds of different
49:11 accounts where you went up there 15
49:12 times sometimes 50 times I don't know 15
49:15 sounds a little more believable to me
49:18 but Mark Twain would be out entertaining
49:21 people in New York City
49:22 he'd say at the end of tonight after
49:25 this dinner I'm gonna take you to my
49:26 buddy
49:26 Tesla's house and he's gonna give you
49:28 his laboratory and he's gonna give you a
49:30 demo you can give you an entertainment
49:33 experience that the world has never seen
49:36 and may never see again and that is
49:38 sadly the [ __ ] truth right
49:40 sadly the truth Tesla would envelop his
49:43 entire body in electricity that if you
49:47 were to touch him he would die
49:48 immediately but he figured out a way to
49:51 create the Faraday cage on his body
49:57 unbelievable he Twain said you know his
50:01 laboratory was lit but he had no lights
50:05 you know I don't know I I tend to
50:10 believe it I don't think Mark Twain was
50:12 a big I mean he was definitely a
50:13 storyteller but people were there people
50:15 saw this probably people without the
50:17 intellectual capacity know what's going
50:19 on which is fantastic because to them it
50:21 was magic which is the intent of the
50:23 illusion of all this stuff right
50:26 we know that Tesla was planning on
50:30 giving away electricity for free in fact
50:32 I just talked to a woman that oh oh
50:36 she's actually yeah she's actually gonna
50:39 work with me on one of my scripts she's
50:42 a genius at geology and she said that
50:47 she had low energy or energy
50:51 transmission between two points
50:52 demonstrated to her which is exactly
50:54 what Tesla's Tower was supposed to do
50:56 which he worked on for 10 years from I
50:58 believe 1917 1929 before JP Morgan had
51:01 him tear it down when he learned you're
51:03 gonna give away power for free there's
51:06 no wires now one of the concerns was
51:10 that if something happened to a
51:12 transmission tower of Tesla's
51:15 construction then there would be no
51:17 backups and I think that that is a
51:22 falsehood
51:23 that would be ridiculous because you
51:25 don't bill one you build a ton of them
51:28 right you don't have to even turn on the
51:29 other ones right but you have one that
51:31 gets injured and according to according
51:36 to the theories that I have read about
51:38 the Tesla Tower you could encapsulate it
51:40 in a building that is not going to
51:45 interfere with a thorough winds
51:46 something very strong not cement because
51:48 that'll screw it up but it gets it there
51:51 and work inside of a building
51:52 transmitting it out to everyone but
51:54 imagine imagine your home gets hurt it
51:58 gets knocked down a little bit and you
52:01 know take this scenario we have
52:04 earthquakes in California we've been
52:05 having a few lately you find yourself
52:08 trapped in a big building you're in your
52:10 home luckily there's no fire there's no
52:13 flooding so you're just trapped and you
52:15 got your cell phone with you and you
52:18 realize that the emergency response
52:20 teams have limited amount of time to
52:23 rescue everyone before they die your
52:28 cell phone has the battery in it and
52:30 powering and working anymore so now
52:32 you're staring at your phone you're
52:33 trying to transmit help me help me I'm
52:35 stuck underneath my bed whatever I'm at
52:37 so-and-so address but by the time they
52:41 get the their power back up to hear your
52:43 call the cellular towers to hear your
52:45 call your battery's out of power
52:47 maybe you're smart enough to turn it off
52:49 until you think it's gonna be time but
52:53 if Tesla had won the game your cell
52:56 phone would work everywhere is all the
52:59 time in fact everything that relies on
53:02 wires would continue to work forever
53:04 those cell phone towers hopefully
53:06 non-lethal kind would still work
53:08 everywhere in fact probably transmitting
53:11 something but communication wise would
53:15 be effortlessly put on the bandwidth
53:17 that would be the power bandwidth see
53:22 what I'm saying let me give you another
53:24 analogy here if you grew up in the 1970s
53:30 and you know how fantastic the music was
53:33 in the 70s and you're like say you're 19
53:37 the eight van halen's dropped their
53:39 first amazing bomb on the world you've
53:41 got every band on planet Earth just
53:43 kicking ass Led Zeppelin Queen everybody
53:46 Pink Floyd everything everything's
53:49 booming are you worried about 20 years
53:53 later children not being able to make
53:55 music or 30 years later everything's
53:57 gonna be Auto tuned and computerized and
53:59 have no soul no because you're in the
54:02 middle of it are you gonna take
54:05 provisions in 78 at the time that this
54:08 is an ax booming era to make sure that
54:10 music doesn't get defunded out of
54:12 schools and colleges and educational
54:15 programs no because you know you can't
54:18 even imagine that so here's a Coral
54:21 Castle guy he knows he's figured out
54:23 some stuff that's been lost in time but
54:26 the same time he was taught by somebody
54:28 in Latvia somebody has that information
54:30 maybe the masons have it at the 33
54:32 degree level or some other group that
54:34 doesn't exist anymore
54:35 maybe in Europe there are people who
54:39 have that knowledge and they're like I
54:40 ain't giving it to all the other people
54:41 the world because they'll create weapons
54:43 out of it and hurt everybody so our guy
54:46 Edward has the knowledge in his brain
54:48 he's looking out his window pervertedly
54:50 symbolically and he sees tesla kicking
54:52 ass and taking names his just ATAR
54:55 hasn't been destroyed yet by the way
54:56 it's destroyed between his move of Coral
55:00 Castle so how would we test this right a
55:06 lot of you contact me all the time about
55:09 the Hutchison effect my closest friends
55:11 talk about the Hutchison effect well I'm
55:16 not exactly sure how it works because I
55:18 don't think the guy has given up all of
55:19 the schematics how it works but it was
55:22 always communicated in the little
55:24 documentaries that I have seen little
55:25 video excerpts of this thing that it was
55:28 an electromagnetism feel that was given
55:32 to objects and the objects became
55:34 weightless mm-hmm that sounds real
55:38 familiar to the theory I just gave you
55:39 right you give limestone a certain
55:42 frequency a certain frequency pattern
55:44 which I would say is sacred geometry
55:47 patterns I just think that's generally
55:50 all ether
55:51 we'll move in some sacred geometry
55:53 manner and then it becomes permeable
55:59 ether moves through it sees ceasing to
56:03 become heavy
56:06 now there's another theory that it is
56:08 the same exact principle of what I gave
56:12 you earlier which I should probably stay
56:14 down I always forget this and I
56:15 apologize imagine you could surround an
56:19 object with an electromagnetic field and
56:22 then the ether that would slam into the
56:26 object just like a just like a Faraday
56:29 cage goes around the entire object its
56:31 shape just becomes slick like an oil
56:35 slick of ether and it just goes round
56:38 the object and now all of a sudden just
56:41 like a semiconductor where the sorry the
56:46 ColdFusion semiconductors that hang on
56:49 to the the little train track and go
56:51 around right they have something called
56:54 quantum locking quantum locking is the
56:58 notion that you have told the the poles
57:02 that would give it weight to absolutely
57:05 go around it based on its voltage charge
57:07 which we actually they actually
57:09 stimulated with cooling down the object
57:11 right in harmony with its
57:13 electromagnetic field and you have this
57:15 mobius strip thing which is beautiful
57:17 this little little tiny puck thing that
57:21 is the superconductor will go all the
57:24 way around both sides of the strip it's
57:25 really just ingenious brilliant stuff
57:27 right so what if his magnetic flywheel
57:32 is creating quantum locking around the
57:34 stone and therefore it just moves up and
57:36 down no problem it immediately locks it
57:41 okay so the the stone doesn't just like
57:45 the puck it doesn't just fly into the
57:46 air but it does stay where it is and you
57:49 can just go Boop and move it wherever
57:51 the hell you need to move it and again
57:54 he says to his patrons it's not hard if
57:59 you know how to do it but why wouldn't
58:02 they want us to have that technology
58:04 jeez think about it man we would have
58:07 Bladerunner 2019 cities in two seconds
58:11 cars would quantum lock on to Rails and
58:15 immediately just fly around zero gravity
58:19 no problem
58:20 quantum lock an object and then put some
58:23 type of propellant on it or do the old
58:24 what is it element 115 that Bob Lazar
58:27 talked about you can just move all over
58:30 the universe however you want
58:32 interesting right hell you may even need
58:35 just like a straw you're just blowing
58:37 the straw and that little push sends you
58:40 a thousand miles an hour in one
58:41 direction be helpful thing to sort out
58:45 if it was that easy
58:46 but imagine you take your car to get
58:48 serviced they need to look underneath it
58:50 there's no lift
58:51 they just quantum lock your car and move
58:54 it up however far they want in fact they
58:56 don't even have to move it up and then
58:57 break their back like this they can take
59:00 the car and rotate it and just look at
59:02 out what you see right here it's right
59:03 here I'm sorry about the [ __ ] moving
59:04 around inside your car but yeah this is
59:06 your fuel pump and screwed up yeah I'm
59:08 just gonna fix this right here and then
59:09 they float your car back maybe the
59:12 quantum lock the the cabin so nothing
59:14 moves around some relative gravity
59:16 that's inside who knows we do know that
59:22 superconductors work I will be doing an
59:24 episode this season on the quantum
59:29 computers so we'll get to that it was
59:33 interesting I explained Coral Castle
59:35 just briefly in the last seven days to a
59:37 relative of mine and I heard this this
59:42 laughs on his iPhone real real quick oh
59:45 okay and I just thought wow it's
59:51 interesting how people poopoo things
59:53 that they have no clue what you just
59:57 said I mean there's no clue what you're
59:59 talking about but their first position
60:02 is well that sounds outrageous obviously
60:05 you're wrong and obviously this isn't
60:09 something scientific it's something
60:14 fictional
60:16 and that's sort of why I like Coral
60:19 Castle because it's sort of here's
60:21 what's interesting to me the Egyptian
60:24 pyramids man they got all these
60:25 ridiculous theories I had to hear one
60:28 regurgitated theory from a very good
60:30 friend of mine as a genius and a sweet
60:31 guy but he said the ramp theory right
60:35 no no he figured out the ramp theory in
60:38 the ramp and the ramp and ramp ramp ramp
60:40 ramp well
60:40 the ramp theory at the steepest slope
60:45 that they think they could build the
60:46 ramp to build one of the pyramids it
60:50 requires I think the estimate is three
60:53 to four times the mass of the pyramid
60:56 that you're building in order to build
60:57 the ramp the ramp takes so much stone
61:00 because you you can't build it too steep
61:02 otherwise you couldn't possibly drag
61:04 things up it so once you level it out
61:06 and I don't know what the sweet spot of
61:08 the ramp is supposed to be they the
61:10 theory was the new theory was that you
61:12 would cannibalize the ramp to build the
61:14 pyramid and then I'm like oh yeah what
61:16 do you do with all this extra stone
61:17 because if you built three of them and
61:19 you keep cannibalizing but you still got
61:22 to build a ramp every single time you're
61:24 gonna have ramp rock everywhere what do
61:27 you do with all the ramp rock there
61:28 should be a ramp just sitting off to the
61:29 side somewhere that goes back am i all
61:32 right
61:32 it's absurd they've been down that route
61:35 we cancel that one out but we still can
61:39 poopoo the pyramids you know one of the
61:43 more fanciful
61:44 stories of the pyramids is obviously
61:46 that aliens built it and if you really
61:48 study the pyramids and the way that
61:50 they're crumbling right now internally
61:51 there's nothing alien about it it's got
61:54 perfect human flaws to it now it is
61:57 based on PI it is four different corners
62:01 being seamed together it is utterly so
62:06 massively amazing that you don't we
62:10 don't know how many tens of thousands of
62:12 years that went back nor how many
62:14 hundreds of thousands years it took to
62:16 get the knowledge to build that place
62:19 but kerul kassel is a nice one built in
62:23 1923 okay that's less than a hundred
62:26 years ago right
62:28 the first person dropped a dime inside
62:30 that star of david' 96 years ago that's
62:35 pretty cool it's pretty recent and as
62:38 much as people try to debunk it again
62:40 hopefully this episode will give you a
62:41 bunch of counter debunking again yeah
62:43 you're wrong it's not just that it was
62:46 just that then you wouldn't need this
62:47 and all that other stuff right but then
62:50 the fact that guy moved it unbelievable
62:53 unbelievable some of you have been there
62:55 and you've reported back some of you've
62:59 been to the Georgia Guidestones with a
63:02 real interesting construction very very
63:04 explainable place but very spooky
63:08 objective to that whole thing there's so
63:13 much of the world that's unexplained but
63:16 I think that we're recapturing it I will
63:19 tell you that one of you reported back
63:23 to me and it was fantastic I have can't
63:26 remember who you were what have you came
63:28 back to me and said you mentioned this
63:30 guy named Erik Dollard it's DOL lar d er
63:34 IC
63:34 I believe apologizing for getting that
63:38 wrong but he's a dude who went
63:43 rediscovered all of the books written
63:45 between Faraday and Tesla as I always
63:47 say he also does a big dive on Steinmetz
63:49 which is a very interesting interesting
63:51 mathematician one of the listeners said
63:53 I went and looked at this and my mind
63:55 was blown and I think the person said
63:58 they had an electronics background as
63:59 well at least electrical background and
64:03 he's like wow this is like a whole new
64:05 universe I'm like yeah since I got a
64:09 little bit of time on this stick quite a
64:11 bit actually I want to pass to you
64:14 something you need to look up with Eric
64:16 dollar now let me explain Eric to you
64:18 for a second I we did an episode on him
64:21 on him kill to radio and sadly we made a
64:25 little joke at the beginning of the
64:26 episode where Eric bragged on point to a
64:29 documentary film crew that he ended up
64:31 at very short period of his life using
64:34 meth and feta means to stay awake while
64:36 he was doing his research and his boast
64:39 which I totally believe is that he goes
64:41 I eat that
64:42 like candy and I didn't get addicted and
64:44 I didn't go crazy but I got a lot of
64:45 work done
64:48 do not do that's okay no matter what
64:50 just get good sleep maybe stay up a
64:53 little longer you know whatever don't do
64:55 what he did and he wasn't recommending
64:56 anyone do that okay but we open the
64:59 episode with that statement and made a
65:01 little joke that this guy's such a
65:02 baller he was able to do this right and
65:05 a lot of people got offended and I'm
65:07 actually kind of glad they did because
65:08 they like Eric so much that they got
65:11 offended by the fact that we would
65:12 mention this and if you they didn't
65:14 listen to the episode of their problem
65:15 because we just we just celebrated this
65:18 guy to the nines for as long as we
65:21 possibly could I will most likely do an
65:24 episode on him this season he's been in
65:27 my list for a long time but what he does
65:29 is if you go look him up you're gonna
65:32 see I guess the best way to describe
65:35 this would be three different types of
65:39 videos you're gonna see you're gonna see
65:41 him doing lectures at colleges and what
65:44 I need you to understand okay if you
65:46 really want to get this dude because
65:47 this will help you with everything that
65:48 I've ever talked about it'll send you on
65:50 your own path to hopefully bring
65:53 treasures back to us okay but Eric I'm
65:57 sorry but if you're gonna watch one of
65:58 his lectures at a college make sure
66:00 you're well-rested well-fed no
66:04 distractions and listen if you're really
66:07 academic about it you might want to get
66:09 a pen and paper write down some of the
66:13 things that he talks about because he's
66:15 gonna mention books that you can
66:16 probably get your hands on I'm not
66:17 [ __ ] cuz I watch the lectures and
66:19 they make sense but I will tell you that
66:22 even with my extremely diverse
66:25 scientific background I had to look up a
66:31 lot of what he was saying because he is
66:33 way above me and I think most human
66:36 beings on planet earth when it comes to
66:38 electricity he understands things
66:41 fluently that most of us will struggle
66:43 to understand you have to be sort of
66:45 that person who loves electronics or
66:47 you've you've already got your master's
66:49 degree or higher I think is what you
66:51 need to understand this guy I don't even
66:53 remember if he is if he has
66:55 degree it wouldn't matter because the
66:57 guy is phenomenal so that's one of the
66:59 sweets you're gonna see of his videos
67:01 okay the second type of video you're
67:04 gonna have are individuals like me going
67:07 up to him and asking him questions
67:08 getting an audience with him sometimes
67:11 he's in his car in the desert sometimes
67:13 he's at his laboratory there was an
67:15 actual it was something like a vice
67:18 special on him I don't know if it was
67:20 vice but it was like a three or four
67:23 guys filming him with a guy you know
67:24 asking him questions and they're usually
67:26 fairly respectful and those interviews
67:31 he will say things that will seem
67:34 outrageous but you need to understand
67:36 that he got his information from the
67:38 military and RCA which built most of the
67:42 radar systems for the military at least
67:45 up to about 1980 but this guy was a
67:48 prodigy child and they gave him a 7
67:51 million dollar laboratory that was a
67:52 military laboratory to play with and his
67:53 off hours like here kids the weekend go
67:57 in there and have some fun but they also
67:58 taught him a bunch of stuff and I will
68:02 give you one thing that they told him so
68:04 that you hear it from me first so it
68:06 won't sound so outrageous when he tells
68:08 you he studied the cycles of the Sun for
68:11 decades
68:12 ok writing down emission level
68:15 submission patterns sunspots the
68:19 frequency of them the magnitude of them
68:21 the radiation differential between no
68:24 sunspots and sunspots the cycles of all
68:26 that stuff the military told him and RCA
68:30 individuals etc that the Sun was a
68:33 portal and I've heard this a lot lately
68:36 from sources that are him now a portal
68:39 to what they asked him follow-up
68:41 question and he goes they don't know but
68:44 it's it's not what you think it is you
68:46 know he's the one that started saying
68:48 you know they know that the Sun is empty
68:50 inside it's gonna plasma core and it's
68:52 empty inside now in the last 10-15 years
68:57 there's a lot of like seemingly fringy
68:59 uf odds you apologists that talk about
69:02 big giant spaceships going into the Sun
69:05 and using that thing as a portal to
69:06 travel around the universe
69:09 that seems like there's a lot more
69:11 information out there to come to that
69:12 conclusion than I've ever heard rumors
69:14 so I don't know what to think about that
69:15 he didn't really lean on that and he
69:17 just said this is what I was told and he
69:19 just matter-of-factly he's pretty old
69:22 now I don't know his real age is he has
69:24 a beard and gray hair so you can't quite
69:27 know and he's always been bald since he
69:30 was really young so it makes him look
69:32 older than it really is
69:35 he's also sort of a maverick you know I
69:38 mean he is a maverick he's one of these
69:39 guys that's like Hunter Thompson who's
69:41 like you can like what I say or you can
69:44 shove it up your butt I don't care so
69:47 just know it's sort of his attitude
69:48 towards things but the third category of
69:51 videos is just jaw-dropping and it has
69:57 to do with the little group that he
69:58 created in the Bay Area San Francisco
70:00 area really the southern region called
70:05 borderland the borderland group or
70:08 something like that I believe I have
70:11 that name right but what he and several
70:13 of his friends did starting around I
70:17 think 86 to about 88 89 somewhere in
70:20 there they were filming profusely tons
70:23 of experiments in somebody's basement a
70:27 lot of the experiments
70:29 the way that this the VIP those scenes
70:31 are set up is they have a big flat table
70:32 and then a one in they have a I don't
70:37 even I don't know if it's a whiteboard
70:38 or if it's just a piece of paper where
70:40 you can flop it over but something on
70:41 the easel where they can write down
70:42 their experiments to tell you what
70:44 they're about to do how they're
70:46 conducting the experiment what machines
70:48 they are using down to what cable gauge
70:50 and what oscilloscopes and power sources
70:53 they're using generators all that stuff
70:56 then they conduct the experiment in
70:58 front of your face they show you all the
71:00 readings of what happened and then they
71:01 explain to you the theory you know the
71:04 quality on these videos because they
71:06 were filmed with camcorders back in the
71:08 day it's not that great which you
71:11 sometimes have to do to read what
71:13 they're writing on the paper is that if
71:15 they filmed a piece of paper far away
71:17 the paper goes blank so you can't see
71:19 anything but they do
71:21 zoom up and show you what's actually
71:24 written on it so you can see what's
71:26 going on so there's kind of a
71:27 back-and-forth what I ended up doing to
71:29 really understand one of my favorite
71:32 experiments he did was I ended up screen
71:34 capturing the video and then putting
71:36 that off to the side so when I watched
71:38 the experiment happened I had the notes
71:40 at all times so you might want to try
71:42 that little trick but one of the most
71:45 beautiful things that he did and if
71:49 you're an electronics specialist
71:50 building components of any kind there
71:54 should be the most riveting mind-blowing
71:56 [ __ ] thing you've ever seen in your
71:57 life
71:59 one of the experiments Eric and his
72:03 counterpart I get the feeling there was
72:05 at least three guys one guy was more of
72:07 a camera operator and the other two were
72:09 really doing all the experiments but I
72:10 think all three of understoo was going
72:12 on he explains to us the difference
72:16 between a longitudinal wave and a
72:18 transverse wave and used many episodes
72:20 where I've quoted his experiment but
72:24 since we're on this fringy technology
72:27 it's the maid Coral Castle possible I
72:29 just want you to know it's like I'm what
72:31 I'm about to tell you and this
72:32 experiment makes Coral Castle look very
72:34 feasible alright now in a nutshell a
72:39 transverse wave is like a rope and you
72:45 have it lying on the ground or maybe
72:46 your friends holding on to other signing
72:48 up a little bit of slack and you whip it
72:50 and you see that wave go to your friends
72:54 hand on the other side another really
72:56 common transverse wave we bump into
72:59 every few weeks when we wash our sheets
73:01 and rebuild our beds is that you take
73:04 your comforter and you whip it and you
73:06 see that wave go across
73:07 that's a transverse wave so what's a
73:11 longitudinal wave
73:12 well beautifully described in this video
73:15 if we took a broom handle big dallof
73:20 would right you hold one side I hold the
73:23 other side and you know that if either
73:26 one of us you've done this with friends
73:28 you probably even gagged you're friends
73:29 with this one you push on it and
73:31 immediately the other side feels it
73:33 immediately if I move it one
73:36 Adam in the direction of your hand
73:39 you're gonna feel one atom of it bump
73:41 you it's immediate
73:44 so what Eric and his buddies in this
73:47 borderland group they created was they
73:51 built a circuit this little square
73:54 circuit there's some I don't remember
73:56 what the components are okay but he
73:59 built this so brilliantly that he was
74:01 able to take this component in the
74:02 square and here's about about five or
74:05 six of them on a table if I remember I
74:08 for four to six somewhere in there and
74:10 he configures it he goes all electricity
74:13 today is based on transverse waves and
74:16 that's why it sucks he tells us that's
74:18 why it's slow that's what he tells us
74:21 what he's basically telling us is it's
74:23 frequency based okay so he configures it
74:28 initially with the transverse wave going
74:32 across the circuit traditional cathode
74:35 negative to positive traveling right and
74:39 he's measuring any outlines all the
74:41 equipment if you just had a basic
74:43 electronics laboratory in your house you
74:45 could probably recreate this as long as
74:47 you can build a little component and he
74:48 tells you what the anatomy that thing is
74:51 he runs a transverse wave over it and
74:54 then he wants to say how quickly sorry
74:59 compared to the speed of light how quick
75:01 this circuit completed the packet of
75:04 electricity getting to the side and it
75:07 was you know I remember if I remember
75:10 right it's 7080 percent the speed of
75:13 light something like that but subspace
75:15 sublight speed and so and he's doing
75:20 this so casually it's ridiculous and he
75:23 takes the circuits and he goes now we're
75:25 going to reconfigure this to be
75:27 longitudinal waves turns at me literally
75:30 rotates him I think like just 90 degrees
75:33 maybe 180 at the most reattaches them
75:36 all together ryote lines the experiment
75:39 goes back to the board tells you what
75:41 he's doing tells you what you're going
75:42 to be witnessing what machines he's
75:45 using to measure this Pao
75:49 he runs it it's over 11 times the speed
75:53 of light all of a sudden and he's kind
75:57 of like nonchalantly broke the speed of
75:59 light in a circuit by 11 factors think
76:04 about that think about that guys gals
76:09 how many of you own computers computers
76:13 or anything right your televisions a
76:15 computer now your cell phones a computer
76:17 your computers a computer your laptop
76:19 your tablet whatever how many times if
76:23 you had to watch a completion bar happen
76:27 on a piece of software I am processing
76:29 your a picture I am loading your drawing
76:31 I am bla bla bla bla bla and you're
76:34 watching this completion bar happen okay
76:38 Intel sits up there and tries to figure
76:40 out how to make a chip faster so does
76:43 AMD so does everybody else all right
76:47 well why aren't these folks building
76:51 longitudinal wave circuits longitudinal
76:54 wave CPUs buses whatever longitudinal
77:01 wave SSDs to get this 10 to 11 X
77:05 performance now maybe your cords you
77:07 might have to build the components out
77:08 of something different because they
77:09 literally the friction by operating at
77:12 that speed might boil the CPU silicon
77:14 who knows but why aren't we at least
77:16 talking about it he shows you right in
77:19 the experiment this working out liyan's
77:22 all the equipment outlines shows you the
77:24 result on the machines boom paradigm
77:29 shift huge paradigm shift but think
77:34 tanks like to call disruptors hmm well
77:41 what are the aside from banks to control
77:46 money alright what are the two well I
77:49 would say what is the most powerful
77:50 sector in the world energy is the most
77:55 powerful sector in the world petroleum
77:57 energy nuclear energy and as they
78:03 electricity it is the most lucrative
78:06 business in the world I'm consuming tons
78:08 of electricity right now just to bring
78:10 this show to you I'm gonna process this
78:14 video in Final Cut and I'm gonna wait
78:16 got an hour and a half or at the process
78:19 on my computer which ain't slow maybe
78:23 the Internet as the 10x increase in
78:25 speed because there's a longitudinal
78:28 method of fiber optics all of a sudden
78:30 instead of 60 gig up and down or a
78:35 hundred gig up and down now it's a
78:37 thousand ten thousand gig up and down we
78:40 never have to wait for information
78:42 transfer ever again we never have to
78:44 wait for our computers to do anything
78:45 unless we tell it to you know calculate
78:47 the answer to life the universe and
78:49 everything
78:50 man's hubris always dictates that we're
78:53 wherever man is in time and space that
78:56 we're the most sophisticated man has
78:58 ever been any one of you study ancient
79:02 architecture monolithic structures the
79:06 clock they found in the Mediterranean
79:07 around 0 ad that looks like it was like
79:13 the most amazing timepiece it was way
79:15 beyond a Sexton and made sure what it is
79:19 we were way ahead a long time ago and
79:24 idiots idiots and power destroy things
79:29 they destroyed for two reasons
79:31 they destroyed out of sheer fear or they
79:34 destroy it to covet they have the power
79:38 and we don't if Bob Lazar is telling the
79:42 truth about these UFOs suck in this
79:44 place called s wall on the side of this
79:45 mountain we've got 9 UFOs from somewhere
79:51 he said in a Joe Rogan interview that
79:53 they were discovered through archaeology
79:54 at least one of them was one of the
79:56 rumors he heard doesn't matter those
80:00 things have been created if they exist
80:03 and supposedly the MA
80:06 you know the the military mothballs them
80:08 every 10 years and then brings it out
80:10 and brings in a bunch of new thinkers
80:11 and they try to crack it and they can't
80:13 get it a little bit further maybe and
80:15 then they put it away for another ten
80:16 years
80:17 but what if it was an open-source
80:19 project the whole world could think
80:21 about it little tiny three-year-olds
80:23 could think about it and they're like no
80:24 and daddy and mommy it's just this thing
80:26 right here that's the way it works
80:27 you're like oh my god the kid figured it
80:29 out awesome
80:30 okay antigravity quantum locking cars or
80:34 now how we travel that you know the
80:36 globe and the maybe beyond I would
80:40 recommend that you read the paper that
80:43 you're not read that he did a book I
80:45 don't know if that's what the paper is I
80:47 have I can't remember but I I remember
80:49 the magnetism paper had a very clinical
80:51 title to it I haven't looked into it for
80:53 a little while but he has a few
80:55 publications and I've even read
80:58 critiques of his publications where
81:00 they're like oh ho ho he's not right
81:03 okay mr. scientist who said he's not
81:06 right where's your Coral Castle where's
81:11 your cool Castle if this is so easy and
81:12 he's so wrong and blah blah blah blah
81:14 blah right what am i relative laughs and
81:20 ridicule the notion that this story had
81:22 any validity hubris insecurity anyone
81:27 scoffing is something they've never
81:29 researched before I would say it's why
81:35 people die on death row who didn't
81:38 commit the murder that's what that kind
81:41 of hubris leads to he keeps us in the
81:44 stone Age's it allows us to regress back
81:49 how many little kids are being lied to
81:51 about all kinds of world agendas right
81:53 now if you're awake the near part of the
81:58 solution it might be fun to use things
82:01 like Coral Castle as a stepping stone to
82:05 something bigger that we could offer the
82:07 world likening it like I did to all
82:09 these other previous things as seemed to
82:11 have used perhaps the same technology
82:14 you know I was fascinated with Egypt as
82:17 a kid you know again when I was a kid
82:20 number 79 my parents bought a book on
82:25 the the
82:30 excavation of the tomb of tutankhamen
82:34 and it had these beautiful clear
82:37 overlays of how they took off each layer
82:39 of his tomb and you know the show this
82:42 is the gold bust on top or first wood
82:44 box and then all these other layers just
82:46 like a Russian doll that we down and I
82:48 was super fascinating and at the time
82:49 you know Leonard Nimoy's doing his show
82:51 on TV telling us that you know aliens
82:55 created the pyramids and here I'm a
82:58 little kid don't have the internet
82:59 around me and I get Scott like the
83:00 official news about things and some my
83:02 brains like going yeah it's awesome
83:04 I just watched 2001 I watched Close
83:08 Encounters a year before so aliens
83:10 awesome loved it then I did the giant
83:13 six year deep dive in the 90s I learned
83:17 how the pyramids were built I have books
83:19 in my house which are really hilarious
83:22 because I ended up finding books that
83:24 were written in the early 20th century
83:28 most I'm written between about 1905 and
83:32 1920 I read the books about how they
83:35 cracked the hieroglyphs off of the
83:38 rosetta stone about how two guys were
83:40 battling it out one guy thought it was
83:41 iconology like like Chinese icons and
83:47 one guy said no I think it's phonetical
83:48 phonetic phonetic Vindico phonetic
83:52 he said no these are these are symbols
83:54 for phrases and sounds in the mind and
83:57 this is a linear thought process you
83:58 have to sound out the work and of course
84:01 ends up happening is the guy that
84:03 thought it was linear phonetics dies in
84:08 an attic of his brother's house
84:10 penniless while the other dude was some
84:12 rich aristocratic Darwin kind of guy you
84:16 know daddy had lots of money one guy was
84:18 a peasant one guy was you know some
84:20 Dukes son or something like that and so
84:22 the guy that said it was iconology kept
84:25 you know taking craps on this other dude
84:28 eventually the guy cracks it in the
84:31 attic actually starts translating
84:33 against the other two languages that are
84:34 on the rosetta stone and of course the
84:37 jerk-off just like Darwin who stoled
84:39 everything from day Lamarck the French
84:40 scientist
84:41 they automatically know everything and
84:44 it's just like that scene in
84:46 Dragonslayer where the kid finally kills
84:48 the dragon and the King you can barely
84:50 walk at this time stands up on the the
84:52 dead dragon in this little Squire what
84:55 off what's inside it pulls out to scroll
84:57 let everybody know that the king killed
84:59 the dragon
84:59 and he didn't he just stole the credit
85:02 for it so this dude who says iconology
85:06 then says oh of course I knew it was
85:08 phonetic the whole time unbelievable
85:10 right but everyone thought the pyramids
85:13 were tombs forever you know it was not
85:16 until that BBC special happened where
85:19 they brought in the experts I said I
85:20 don't think this is um I don't think
85:22 these are tombs not sure what this is
85:24 talks to a local Mason was probably
85:26 passed by now but he was in his 80s at
85:28 the time very healthy man he's moving
85:31 around no problem in and he said no
85:33 these are these are power generators
85:36 because this whole thing is a big
85:37 battery it's a big power source it's a
85:40 craft work it's a power plant right and
85:45 then we started finding the hieroglyphs
85:48 where we see these people holding things
85:49 look like light bulbs if you if you load
85:53 up the plateau that these pyramids are
85:55 on with electricity electrical water in
85:57 these catacombs on top of an aqua ravine
85:59 same way Tesla built is Tower 1917 then
86:04 you just stick a rod down there and you
86:06 can pull out as much electricity as you
86:07 want electricity just gives you what you
86:10 can capacitate what you can flow that's
86:12 why your outlets in the side of your
86:15 house don't sit there and spew
86:16 electricity outside until you plug
86:18 something in and it gives you what you
86:20 can digest most electronics in your
86:23 house even though you're getting 110 out
86:25 of the wall most of electronics in the
86:27 world run on 3.3 volts or 5 volts that's
86:31 most chips in the world most circuitry
86:34 in the world it's all transpose down to
86:36 only use this tiny trickle of power so I
86:42 hope this was valuable to you this is
86:43 what I've been wanting to do for a very
86:45 very long time I wanted to do it justice
86:47 I actually did an episode and I think
86:50 season 2 or something where I did one on
86:52 sacred geometry I started to
86:55 reference Coral Castle inside the sake
86:57 of geometry episode and I finally just
86:59 gave up on it I had in my editing Bay
87:01 forever because I I realized in the
87:04 middle of the episode I should have just
87:06 made it about Coral Castle and then
87:07 mentioned sacred geometry as a part of
87:09 the episode so this reverses it in the
87:11 right path in my opinion so my
87:14 recommendation is to do the deep dive on
87:18 a Coral Castle if you haven't heard
87:19 about it even if you've been there it
87:21 might be even more amazing to you to go
87:23 research in gum and I was there you know
87:25 and look at the photographs pay
87:28 attention to everything I've told you
87:30 read as much as you can about these
87:33 quotes from the guy about having seen
87:36 him do what he did and then go steady
87:41 Eric Dollard videos you should do that
87:43 anyway just just go into Eric dollars
87:45 stuff again brace yourself some of its
87:47 extremely deep even if you listen to it
87:50 in a light-hearted way his borderline
87:52 experiments are amazing his private
87:56 one-on-one sessions at restaurants
87:59 inside of his car those are a little
88:01 more esoteric a little harder to follow
88:03 still extremely valuable but you're
88:05 gonna have to know other things that he
88:07 said in my opinion to completely
88:08 understand what he's talking about for
88:10 any of you who've study electrical
88:11 universe most of the things he learned
88:14 from RCA in the military in late 70s
88:16 correlates a thousand percent with where
88:18 we are with electric universe if you're
88:21 super duper interested new to the
88:23 channel then you want to go watch
88:25 probably every II throw episode that
88:27 I've done just go to the website deep
88:29 thoughts radio.com search in the field
88:31 for ether I've spelled it two different
88:34 ways because there's two different ways
88:35 to spell it e th ER or AE th ER
88:39 sometimes I'll say ether role but I
88:43 think I'm going to create a category aka
88:46 playlist on the website so you can just
88:48 find those really quickly but that will
88:51 open your mind it will give you a lot of
88:53 solace and peace about how the universe
88:55 is created gravity will no longer be a
88:59 mystery to you it will not be a
89:00 phenomenon as these other scientists
89:02 will say and one thing I'll brace you
89:04 for once you figure out that ether is
89:06 gravity
89:07 and it it's all pressure right so for
89:10 those of you like now it's atmospheric
89:11 pressure it's like it is but ether is
89:13 the thing not oxygen water it all
89:16 behaves the same but the reason why you
89:19 can take a clear ceramic cube and put a
89:24 feather inside vacuum all the air out
89:26 and you turn it in the feather still
89:28 false you know according to air pressure
89:31 people that will feather should just be
89:33 in zero gravity inside there the reason
89:35 why it still falls in the ceramic
89:36 container is because either doesn't give
89:38 a [ __ ] about oxygen it flows right
89:41 through that ceramic cube and it works
89:44 great now if you could Electrify and
89:46 quantum lock the box and still see
89:48 inside you would see that feather most
89:51 likely go BAM right to the center and
89:53 just start floating around like a little
89:54 screensaver right but it'll blow your
89:58 mind and it will depress the crap out of
90:00 you when you see brilliant people like
90:01 Bob Lazar go its gravity wouldn't even
90:03 know what it is you know they're neil
90:04 degrasse tyson but we don't know what
90:06 gravity is it's like really okay so the
90:10 authorities of the world for all science
90:13 are completely upside down you'll you'll
90:15 soon disband the notion of a big bang of
90:18 dark matter of black holes all those
90:20 things disappear once you understand how
90:22 ether works okay you might have a black
90:25 hole like the movie black hole where
90:28 it's a vortex that goes down I think
90:29 those things should probably exist now
90:32 whether or not it can capture light who
90:33 knows who cares if we find one we'll
90:36 find one whatever it's not the the O
90:39 ring that the scientists just submitted
90:41 and said it was a black hole that thing
90:43 doesn't exist
90:44 okay you can't exist just like physics
90:47 breaks down and the black had the big
90:48 bang physics utterly breaks down at the
90:51 center of a black hole theory that is
90:53 pull gravity not push gravity all right
90:56 there's many things to be uncovered as
90:59 there are many truths that will be
91:01 revealed as Neil Armstrong said in one
91:03 of his speeches one of his last speeches
91:05 about the munoz he was trying to tell us
91:07 this isn't true I'm not gonna risk my
91:11 life to tell you the truth but
91:13 eventually you'll find out the truth and
91:15 we didn't go right and so there's all
91:18 kinds of things about science that are
91:19 right
91:20 with that whole thinking so hope you
91:22 feel me on this do your research
91:24 contribute your brain trust don't worry
91:27 about you having a formal degree in
91:29 anything this is all SuperDuper logical
91:31 thinking right did Faraday have a PhD in
91:35 electronics no he discovered all of it
91:37 right on Volta Tesla all these people
91:40 discovered stuff invented theories
91:43 invented methodologies excuse me not
91:44 just there he's been mechanical devices
91:46 of which we use today they didn't have
91:49 degrees in this stuff they had degrees
91:51 in science but they just went into a
91:55 little room and figured it out their
91:59 laboratories something that Einstein
92:01 never had if you have them in too deep
92:03 those radio.com
92:04 please go it's where all the video and
92:08 audio exists in terms of feeds there's
92:11 two places for video two places for
92:13 audio bit shoot is going to be behind
92:15 for a while because it takes a long time
92:17 to upload a bit shoot mainly because
92:20 you'll upload a bit shoot in like they
92:21 just don't encode it's really sad audio
92:26 is supported on all devices so just get
92:28 up there and click the link if you want
92:30 to conversate beyond YouTube YouTube is
92:32 actually a great place to go again for
92:34 those of you and I don't think there's a
92:36 lot of you to do this but definitely get
92:38 into the comments on YouTube because
92:39 people are saying amazing things and you
92:42 can also help each other because some
92:43 people are sharing their their journeys
92:45 and they need advice on things not a lot
92:49 but a little enough that you can make a
92:50 difference put that way it's sort of a
92:54 movement if you will the social media
92:59 outlets currently yes they're all deep
93:01 state things are very very sorry what
93:03 else we're gonna do until someone ponies
93:05 up some other solution for us it's you
93:08 know got free speech police
93:10 hopefully this seems like an antiquated
93:12 comment in the future that we might
93:13 actually protect the First Amendment of
93:15 the United States Constitution but we
93:19 have Facebook it's locked so whatever
93:21 you do in there is like Vegas it stays
93:23 there right you could say all kinds of
93:25 crazy crap your employer can't find out
93:27 unless they join the page and why would
93:29 right you have to answer the question
93:32 which says say something human lately
93:35 people have been reading it and saying
93:36 something human you don't need to say a
93:37 lot just say Klaatu Barada nikto you
93:40 know the other one is Twitter I don't do
93:44 much twitting but you can get up there
93:48 and get the feed if that's the we like
93:49 to get it I just basically post the
93:51 links to the recent stuff it does not
93:52 have all the links because they didn't
93:54 started way back at the beginning I
93:55 think you'll be fine with that there is
93:58 also as I mentioned over and over again
94:00 the new remastered season one there's
94:03 two ways to get season one remastered
94:04 click on the link at the top of the
94:06 website and go to the channel the
94:07 distinct channel for season one it will
94:10 no longer receive new videos
94:11 it is now complete the reason why I did
94:14 that for the newcomers is that I put a
94:16 bunch of my music from my personal
94:18 catalogue to start out episodes into end
94:20 episodes and YouTube said we don't allow
94:24 this to be played in Europe we don't
94:25 allow us to be played on mobile devices
94:27 I mean it's just a bunch of screwballs
94:29 stuff right so all that's been stripped
94:32 off the audio in this channel for season
94:35 1 is atrocious it's up and down all over
94:38 the place I kept the mic about half an
94:40 inch from my mouth I do apologize for
94:42 that so I've edited a ton of the space
94:45 out of the videos or I'm clearing my
94:48 throat taking a drag thinking too much
94:49 and so I took all those pauses out some
94:52 episodes have been sped up by 5 minutes
94:54 but the audio is also balanced so I took
94:57 all the audio tracks exported them
94:58 putting them audition Doby audition
95:00 bounced all the vocals out so if
95:03 anything they might be a little too loud
95:04 if anything up a new soundtrack on it
95:08 and so it so you can go to that channel
95:11 or you can just go to the website and
95:13 anything you find that season one is the
95:16 new channel so it's all kind of all in
95:18 place in deep thoughts video comm you
95:20 have a huge thing I keep mentioning is
95:21 that the categories will help you find
95:23 the playlist that matches your selection
95:25 your appetite for information so you
95:28 just want NASA stuff it's in there you
95:30 just want a lien stuff self-improvement
95:32 stuff it's all in there special category
95:34 so you don't really have to search if
95:35 you don't want to but because I don't
95:37 spend a tremendous amount of time doing
95:39 the embedded links in these videos
95:42 you do if I mention I did an episode
95:46 called this or that the best way to do
95:48 it is write that down go to the website
95:50 hit the search field type in that and
95:52 boom you're fine in two seconds and
95:53 you're good probably even less than two
95:55 seconds there's two ways to donate to
95:58 the page I do want to talk about
95:59 donations for a second since this is an
96:01 early episode of season 5 you know I'm
96:05 watching the monetization shenanigans on
96:10 YouTube this this service is getting
96:14 heavily demonetised I said the majority
96:17 the the lion's share of all the videos
96:18 are most definitely monetized on YouTube
96:21 but it's interesting how when I touch
96:24 agendas that we really need to discuss
96:25 they D monetize in two seconds because
96:27 you're not supposed to pay attention
96:28 like social credit system of China why
96:32 wouldn't that be monetizable come on
96:34 they just don't want it to be seen
96:38 so there's shadow banning I think works
96:40 like this they take the video and they
96:44 immediately demonetized it which elects
96:46 it for a back-end process remember
96:48 YouTube and Google are the same company
96:50 so the two things that they do to shadow
96:52 ban is one YouTube is going to elect it
96:55 out of any recommended search the whole
96:57 channel can just get yanked out but what
97:01 Google does because I've now been having
97:03 to search on my old videos to scrape the
97:05 descriptions into other channels as they
97:07 actually propagate that shadow banning
97:11 over to their mothership which is Google
97:13 search engine and it gets removed out of
97:14 search engine so you'll search on the
97:16 exact name of one of my videos and you
97:18 won't find it so one of the things
97:20 that's inside the donation area we have
97:23 patreon which a lot of folks use it's a
97:25 monthly subscription what you get is the
97:27 link so second I'm uploading them from
97:28 my computer if I've and sometimes you
97:31 get like two or three days preview on
97:33 that sometimes it's just a few minutes
97:34 few hours ahead depends on how often I'm
97:37 releasing videos the other one is PayPal
97:40 no one's ever used it three or four
97:42 people asked for it don't know why
97:43 because they never use it I don't care
97:45 which way you go but the other one is
97:47 not really a big moneymaker but it's
97:49 something very important for us which is
97:51 currently this browser exists I don't
97:53 know if in the future this browser is
97:54 going to exist
97:56 they come and go they're trying to make
97:57 money in a really weird way so I hope
97:59 they succeed but it's called the brave
98:01 browser and it automatically blocks
98:04 there's a bunch of these type of browser
98:05 so if brave disappears go search on one
98:07 that does this for you know I'll keep
98:09 updating the bumpers on this and a
98:10 website towards something that does this
98:13 but it blocks all of the ad ads being
98:16 presented on web sites and it blocks all
98:18 the trackers and trackers are the super
98:20 important one where trackers do is it
98:23 lets CNN we're sorry let's Amazon know
98:25 you were on CNN here's what you need to
98:28 know about that
98:29 once a little ad is embedded on CNN that
98:34 actually goes over to Amazon Amazon only
98:39 can serve you ads based on what you last
98:42 searched on if you're a Black and Decker
98:43 drill you'll see Black & Decker drill
98:45 ads all over the place but it also tells
98:48 Amazon where you were meaning the URL
98:52 this is being referenced from is now
98:55 Amazon's database tracking so if you
98:58 didn't want someone to know that you're
99:00 looking at website a website be at this
99:02 article this and that these ad blockers
99:05 and tracker blockers are huge because it
99:08 cuts all that off now nobody knows where
99:10 you've been except the site that you
99:12 went on
99:12 so that's gigantic it also blocks all of
99:17 those autoplay movies so you go to CNN
99:19 or Fox or whatever your appetite is you
99:23 go and they try to immediately play some
99:25 video on you and you try to scroll down
99:27 it pops up on the side I mean it's just
99:29 sucking down bandwidth and you don't
99:30 want it you just want to read the
99:31 article it stops that immediately so
99:34 that's also huge it tracks generally how
99:37 many seconds it's saving you per page
99:39 load if you use it for about six months
99:41 it will save over 30 minutes of browsing
99:43 waiting time for those pages to load
99:46 it's really great brave is not only
99:49 available for Windows and Mac but it's
99:51 also iOS and Android so you can get it
99:53 everywhere you go second thing I need
99:55 you guys to do again this might change
99:58 but I started using DuckDuckGo instead
100:02 of Google so you go into the browser
100:03 settings and you say don't use Google as
100:05 a search use DuckDuckGo now you can use
100:07 any other service the
100:09 to that you believe in that you like but
100:13 let's cut off the head of the snake
100:15 shall we let's not give them all of our
100:17 search data because some of these folks
100:19 are fairly decent now there's always
100:21 gonna be speculation as to who owns
100:22 these places and whatever but let's at
100:24 least cut off that artery and make them
100:26 go an extra mile to get our to get our
100:29 data okay I think you fill me right all
100:33 right well tell me debut another episode
100:35 take care of yourself in someone else
100:38 I know seen the next deep thoughts over
100:40 now
100:43 [Applause]
