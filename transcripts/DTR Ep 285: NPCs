00:00 [Music]
00:33 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:35 deep thoughts so today is about NPCs or
00:39 non player characters and there's a very
00:43 interesting reality to this because I've
00:47 been talking about it for about a year
00:48 and a half cannibalizing my background
00:51 in video games making them not just
00:54 playing them and I've never heard anyone
00:58 really get into this sort of thing and
00:59 then one of our listeners contacts me
01:01 and says completely on the other side of
01:03 Planet and she says my husband and I and
01:04 this other guy are really debating this
01:08 now and there's sort of a movement
01:10 around the whole thing I'm like cool I
01:15 sit in a cigar lounge where we look for
01:19 things online and I've never heard
01:21 anyone bring it up so I love the fact
01:22 that people are starting to think about
01:23 this but we need to define what a
01:27 non-player character really is so that
01:31 we can have a conversation now if you
01:33 and I were to to meet and you're sitting
01:35 with his camera is and I'm over here we
01:38 would talk about our lives we talk about
01:40 where we were brought up and the
01:43 processes of accomplishing what we've
01:48 accomplished and there's a certain level
01:49 of difficulty in reality that we would
01:52 share you know yeah my mom was like that
01:54 too yeah my dad was like that too you
01:56 know school was just like that oh yeah
01:57 yeah you know you got your first job oh
01:59 yeah did you ever see a guy he totally
02:01 got where you wanted to go in that area
02:02 and it just seems to be this normal
02:06 progression of events this normal level
02:09 of friction and this normal level of
02:12 exploration
02:13 and how it captivates you along your
02:17 journey right
02:18 I mean imagine you have a field of
02:23 flowers all kinds of exotic avatar types
02:28 I mean they glow they they trade pollen
02:32 in some crazy sacred geometry cloud
02:35 between them and you know you and I walk
02:38 in there and we're like holy [ __ ] you
02:40 know it's like low light so we can see
02:42 it all really nice and we're just
02:43 literally in like a bot nice dream and
02:49 then there's a guy who's never been
02:51 there just walks right through and goes
02:54 to the other side and exits and you're
02:58 like wait wait a minute
02:59 who the hell was that I don't know well
03:02 he didn't even stop yeah now we're it is
03:06 weird I mean I know that scientifically
03:09 speaking this person has never seen
03:10 something so amazing in their life but
03:12 they just walked maybe they were
03:14 terrified I don't know if it it would
03:17 seem it seems more easy in a political
03:23 room to find these folks
03:28 because at least with the rock star or a
03:31 movie star you can least point at a
03:34 skill and go well yeah well they're good
03:38 at that you know but a politician which
03:42 is where NPCs you know it's interesting
03:46 that's when we usually bring it up is
03:49 when we're talking about a politician
03:50 because what are we looking at we're
03:53 looking at a heartless gutless soulless
03:55 piece of [ __ ] who's in some gigantic
03:59 role of power perceivably right again if
04:04 a puppets a puppet what is a puppet you
04:07 stick your hand up its ass it doesn't
04:10 have a soul of its own it only speaks
04:12 with what you impersonate it to be
04:14 speaking mm-hmm now there's a couple
04:21 ways to approach this conversation on a
04:22 long term basis I'm gonna talk about
04:25 NPCs more but we should probably get out
04:28 of the way in the foundation of this
04:29 conversation what what would we be
04:32 talking about in terms of where they
04:34 come from if they truly did exist where
04:37 they coming from for those of you
04:40 believe it's a computer simulation right
04:41 off the bat it is a computer simulated
04:44 human but so would we like well the
04:46 Warcraft the quest giver the merchants
04:49 they're not real people or controlled by
04:51 the computer if they have so much speech
04:53 they can do so take them up to Westworld
04:56 level if full speech full cognitive
04:58 capabilities in both but we're on a
05:01 computer then take it into the real
05:04 world it is West world we physically do
05:06 exist we do have a $0.05 system that we
05:09 live in the vessel they have some form
05:12 of that but they are automated they are
05:17 controlled okay the other one might be
05:22 that we have sort of a that we are an
05:27 insect that is possessed
05:31 and so we're all being possessed but one
05:37 is a lot more one is possessed for the
05:40 sheer purpose of creating an
05:46 antagonistic character to our
05:49 protagonistic storyline and so we it's
05:54 just part of the process it just has to
05:56 be this way but the interesting thing is
05:58 is I think we can see these robots these
06:03 need to say robots
06:05 tenacious d had a funny line in one of
06:06 their if their first record we're like
06:12 it's cage stuck in 2gb and he says do
06:17 you think we have robots do you think we
06:19 have robots living among us senses no I
06:22 don't think we have the technology let
06:24 me go on with the album I thought that
06:26 was very interesting so I only left the
06:29 seat of my brain but now a lot of these
06:33 politicians many of us haven't seen them
06:35 in real life which is always kind of
06:37 disconcerting you know to think you
06:40 think someone is real that you've never
06:41 seen because you seen him on television
06:44 but you take like a Barack Obama who has
06:47 absolutely no [ __ ] past he has spent
06:50 millions covering up his records or
06:53 someone has at least four million
06:55 dollars to taxpayer money and then you
06:59 have someone like Al Gore you know I'll
07:03 go on a Barack Obama have something in
07:04 common and that they both won Nobel
07:06 prizes for [ __ ] nothing or [ __ ]
07:09 right I look at Al Gore talk come on
07:14 folks he is a living [ __ ] robot and a
07:18 bad old model to begin with according to
07:21 the Tyrell corporation he would be like
07:23 an alpha of you know the Nexus 1 Barack
07:27 Obama got in front of a group of sixth
07:30 graders his teleprompters broke and he
07:34 left because he couldn't think of
07:36 something to say to [ __ ]
07:38 sixth-graders oh sure he got two
07:41 daughters of his own mm-hmm yeah you can
07:45 raise two daughters but you can't talk
07:47 to sixth graders me a [ __ ] break but
07:50 you're qualified to be president
07:51 it just gets more insane and worn saying
07:54 with these people so it's need to come
07:57 up with a theory it's need to name a few
07:59 people that seem [ __ ] weird you know
08:02 Hillary Clinton she seems like a goddamn
08:04 robot Hillary Clinton seems like she
08:07 speaks out of a catalogue of what other
08:09 people have said in a cliche trite
08:13 boring shallow away right she's never
08:16 said anything in your entire [ __ ]
08:17 life that has ever been deep or
08:20 meaningful or anything she is just a
08:23 playbook 4243 strike oh you're doing
08:27 that Owen yeah you know it was invented
08:28 in 1938 when football was starting to
08:31 take off oh yeah but what is a
08:36 politician also called from time to time
08:38 they're called puppets if you think
08:41 about it what is a puppet you didn't do
08:44 much until you stick your hand up its
08:46 ass right tell it what to say
08:47 and people can take turns sticking their
08:51 hand up it's s already Obama's getting
08:53 excited she can control it over and over
08:57 and over you can have one personality
09:00 for an interview it could have another
09:02 personality for a speech a speech to a
09:05 sixth grader a speech to a bunch of
09:11 Oprah's listeners but as we always have
09:13 to ask to what in and never uh never
09:21 clip a short filler cigar with a
09:24 guillotine
09:25 it's like a kaleidoscope of [ __ ] in your
09:28 mouth short fillers are cigars that are
09:31 made from the floor clippings you never
09:34 know when you're getting one this was a
09:36 freebie from babalu cigars tastes
09:41 delicious we've got damn it's like
09:42 confetti in my mouth - what in though
09:46 right
09:47 well we know that we have to have choice
09:49 in this world and they know they have to
09:53 control the experiment like really
09:56 control it maybe their goal is to create
10:00 leadership out of our stock but we can't
10:06 do it you know the Russians for instance
10:08 it's a very interesting story one of my
10:11 old partner she's half Jewish and half
10:14 Russian and she did her internship in
10:18 Russia it's just when I confirmed the
10:20 [Music]
10:21 rumor that they don't have a lot of
10:23 microwaves in Russia it's due to health
10:26 reasons not due to their inability to
10:29 microwave food or build the invention
10:32 she told me that for hundreds of years
10:35 the Russian citizens would actually send
10:37 for a Tsar from Europe to run their
10:40 country because they didn't have that
10:42 kind of vocational aptitude back in the
10:45 day they could never get anyone up to
10:48 that point at least where they felt
10:51 comfortable and so here comes these
10:52 czars moving in and they are of European
10:56 descent they have all these medals and
10:57 honors they like Michael Jackson on
10:59 steroids and the people are so happy
11:01 because they're like oh my god at least
11:02 this person will help us develop help us
11:06 get some sort of economy going even
11:09 create an economy take our agricultural
11:12 products and find a buyer and our steel
11:14 manufacturing will be set up and we'll
11:16 have some buyers of that too then we'll
11:18 bring in some engineering recipes and
11:19 build some something so we've seen this
11:24 sort of sensibility in world history and
11:26 Russia probably is not the only one it's
11:29 just the only one I know of but look
11:32 what happened Russia stop doing that
11:34 Vladimir Putin is a Russian citizen he
11:36 looks he looks probably the most pure
11:39 Russian of any male I've ever seen pure
11:44 if NPCs were to exist then this is truly
11:51 an experiment
11:54 breather in a computer or we're in a
11:57 physical body and they are keeping the
12:04 training wheels on as it were of
12:06 experiment embedding themselves inside
12:09 our flesh or our form such that they can
12:14 sort of manipulate the experiment on a
12:16 daily basis and watch what happens
12:19 and I'm just gonna run with this so you
12:23 know I'm not sure if I believe any of
12:25 this I'm just gonna run with it right
12:28 but now what what would you want to do
12:31 if you had a like a know some cage with
12:35 a creature in it and you have programmed
12:39 them to want the fundamentals of the
12:42 universe
12:44 because they are sort of the true form
12:48 of life which might be better defined as
12:52 sovereignty or freedom from harm but
12:58 also the sovereignty and freedom to
13:02 succeed in some endeavor and so I sound
13:07 like a robot don't I so the idea is you
13:11 would want a stress test the ability of
13:14 your being to do this and again dahab
13:17 totally other analogy would be you want
13:19 your car to go fast you're building a
13:21 Formula One car and so what is this what
13:24 is the factor that you're gonna stress
13:25 in the car your neck stress speed first
13:29 straight-arrow speed down a runway down
13:33 a salt flat then what do you have to do
13:36 well you know f1 courses are anything
13:39 but straight lines some of them are
13:41 absolutely insane in terms of hairpin
13:45 turns and what have you so now you have
13:46 to create a vehicle around the engine
13:48 that can handle all this stress that
13:52 bike and because turning at the fastest
13:55 speed is usually where you get to pass
13:56 people and you know win the race then we
14:01 need to make sure that that is our car
14:03 is the best freaking car on planet earth
14:05 to do this the engine has to be able to
14:08 come to zero as soon as quick as
14:11 possible not zero but go way way way
14:13 down to do these hair porn pear print
14:14 turns and then we want the engine to
14:15 accelerate as fast as possible and then
14:20 you feel me but they could bite it if
14:22 freedom and success and ingenuity and
14:25 invention is our charter as a being then
14:30 they would want to stress everything has
14:34 to do with that
14:36 stressing our bodies right someone might
14:39 say smoke three packs of cigarettes a
14:41 day I want to see what happens oh yeah
14:43 the filters kill you the chemicals on
14:45 the paper kill you now smoke five cigars
14:49 a day or 18 cigars a day oh man that guy
14:51 lived to be a hundred years old
14:52 Oh interesting interesting you don't
14:55 smoke chemicals and fiberglass
14:58 but now maybe the formula car and the
15:01 NPC is actually a pretty good analogy
15:02 because the idea might go down to this
15:05 what if you had no course you had just
15:09 open ground okay for as far as the eye
15:13 could see thousands of miles in all
15:15 directions you put a ton of formula cars
15:17 down inside the game grid and instead of
15:21 like shooting a light cycle tale out the
15:23 back they just wander around they bump
15:27 into each other they break their wheels
15:29 some crash and kill themselves some of
15:31 them just drive in a straight line
15:33 because they just don't know how to
15:34 steer you have chaos you're trying to
15:37 herd the cats is it were she looking
15:39 down going alright alright we got to do
15:41 something about this that has to have
15:43 some form and fashion for us to really
15:46 see how this works we can't just have a
15:48 random life you know chaos program money
15:53 so they had form they had governments
15:57 nations they had races in language all
16:01 of it's a stress test for us well you
16:05 know all of you are the same we're gonna
16:08 make some of you really dark brown so
16:10 we're gonna be kind of yellow gonna be
16:12 red and the white people will they're
16:15 gonna rotate through all of them we're
16:19 gonna make you speak Spanish you speak
16:20 English you speak French you speak so
16:23 healy whatever let's see how you get
16:26 along now oh look at that experiment
16:29 what happened oh man that race just
16:33 totally killed the other race Jesus
16:35 we'll put some more back down there you
16:38 can't have any genocide they'll [ __ ]
16:40 with our experiment yeah no problem
16:42 got them cooking up they have to keep
16:46 the thing on course think about some of
16:50 the ludicrous [ __ ] that happens at the
16:52 political level and it for me right now
16:54 you know I could imagine some
16:56 celebrities being NPCs for sure but I
17:01 tell you the ones that are more Bonnett
17:02 bonafide is are the politicians excuse
17:04 me there's because they're there that's
17:09 because because they are
17:12 ones that really control the policies of
17:14 how we are a loud quote unquote to
17:17 behave in a bunch of [ __ ] [ __ ] we
17:21 have because of mass hysteria we allow
17:24 these folks to control our lives since
17:28 shitty ways California states about to
17:30 get a huge red enema their God we have
17:36 the single most concentrated democratic
17:40 [ __ ] running this state that has
17:43 ever existed in humanity
17:46 unbelievable [ __ ] like you can be
17:49 arrested or fined you know twenty
17:52 thousand dollars as a waitress that asks
17:53 if you want to [ __ ] straw on this
17:55 date right if you so much see it look
17:59 down and say I'm a boy because I got
18:03 this [ __ ] between my legs they want to
18:05 press charges against you
18:07 right I mean it's like the [ __ ]
18:09 lunatic lunatic children have taken over
18:12 this [ __ ] place it's crazy
18:14 one billionaire wants to separate the
18:16 state into three [ __ ] pieces and it's
18:19 being reported like he just gets his way
18:21 un-fuckin'-believable right every single
18:25 place in this state where a collection
18:26 of homeless people get together that
18:28 community has so many [ __ ] problems
18:31 on their hands from people being raped
18:33 and murdered and accosted by these
18:36 really aggressive panhandlers and our
18:39 state goes yeah boy that everywhere
18:41 nothing about building institutions to
18:44 rehabilitate these people get the back
18:46 on their feet like we used to have but
18:49 now think about it I just allowed myself
18:52 to react on camera to these stupid
18:54 agendas so you could see what a player
18:58 non-player character could do to me
19:01 the politicians enlarge we're NPCs isn't
19:09 it interesting how this entire society
19:10 is set up for us to look at them listen
19:13 to them turn back to our real citizens
19:17 and react to it
19:21 well have you ever been involved in some
19:23 sort of experiment where your brain was
19:26 being questioned you watched a movie
19:29 trailer six months before the movie
19:31 comes out and they're asking you it was
19:33 that motivating to you would you ever
19:35 participate well they show you something
19:38 and then you react
19:42 haven't you filled out a survey online
19:44 after you used a service first use a
19:46 service then you felt survey that's what
19:48 we're talking about that process now
19:54 there is a scene in season two of West's
19:56 role that is very very brilliant I will
20:04 speak about this metaphorically because
20:06 the season is very new and a lot of you
20:08 haven't had a chance to see it so this
20:09 will ruin it for you at all of course
20:13 the reason to bring your Westworld here
20:14 is because it's an example of a
20:16 fictional example of robotic technology
20:19 reaching a level where human beings
20:21 can't tell the difference as most of you
20:24 would assume there's gonna be a point in
20:25 the history of this show where you're
20:27 gonna get to see the backstory of who
20:29 invested in West Rome because they keep
20:34 telling you that the place was running
20:36 out of money and at some point it gained
20:38 its stride it gained its purpose and its
20:40 stride they beautifully reenact the
20:43 moment when the investors who are
20:46 solicited to help out are shown the
20:52 technology and you know our assumption
20:56 was that or my assumption I should say
20:58 was that it was so far in the future
21:00 that it was not a huge leap for the
21:04 person to see this technology when they
21:09 went into West world right but there's
21:11 this scene they reenact with the
21:13 investors evaluating the technology and
21:18 they are like we are today where they
21:22 are going how could you be so far
21:25 advanced we don't have this technology
21:27 yet it's the hundred-year theory episode
21:29 I did right so look at our captors final
21:33 objective be for us
21:35 with these NPCs do they want to always
21:37 have NPCs here holding our hands well if
21:41 it's anything like training wheels the
21:44 easy answer would be no eventually we
21:48 rise to the point where we can take
21:51 control and something else happens right
21:56 now I don't want this to be some
21:58 political bias thing you know usually I
22:01 dislike all politicians quite frankly
22:03 and I think a lot of them I think every
22:04 single one of them are flawed human
22:08 beings because human beings are flawed
22:11 they really are and I'm right there at
22:14 the front of the protest holding the
22:16 sign saying we are flawed yeah the one
22:19 thing I think is interesting about
22:20 Donald Trump becoming president is that
22:23 he and again they try to make him like
22:26 he's not human because he had a family
22:30 that had some real estate prior to him
22:32 starting his real estate venture and
22:34 again Donald Trump was at the right
22:35 place at the right time with the right
22:37 education with literally a tiny bit of
22:40 seed money to make his fortune you know
22:45 and again I've heard people say [ __ ] it
22:48 two hundred million dollar inheritance
22:49 rumor and it's like one there's
22:52 something called inheritance tax in this
22:54 country they take half of it no matter
22:57 what you did but his family was part of
23:01 this he has brothers and sisters what
23:02 have you and you know they're very firm
23:05 about him inheriting 1 million dollars
23:07 but I know people with a hundred million
23:11 dollars in the bank and they are not
23:12 remotely headed to 1 billion I I know
23:16 through say third-party acquaintances
23:21 who have a billion dollars and they're
23:23 not remotely headed to making 10 you
23:26 know and money is not the end-all be-all
23:28 a judgement of who you are as a person
23:30 by any stretch of the imagination but it
23:32 does relate to accomplishment and the
23:38 sort of a character
23:39 a cross-section of who you are what
23:43 you're capable of doing in this planet
23:45 well look at the difference between a
23:47 speech from Donald Trump and a speech
23:49 from all the presidents before him this
23:53 dude is real he goes up there and talks
23:56 like a real human being in fact he has
23:58 mocked his he has mocked et one who says
24:08 he doesn't act presidential by walking
24:09 up to the podium after he's president he
24:13 walks up but he goes you know they want
24:14 me to be back presidential and he goes I
24:17 thought getting work done it was
24:19 presidential I thought fixing all these
24:20 problems was presidential and so he
24:24 walks up stage and he goes let me show
24:26 you what presidential looks like he
24:27 walks off stage and he stiffens up like
24:29 Al Gore like Barack Obama and he walks
24:33 out this really weird Walker he doesn't
24:35 move his arms and he stands at the
24:37 podium and he starts talking like this
24:39 and god bless america
24:40 knows the [ __ ] and he walks off real
24:42 stiff and then he he goes back and he's
24:44 like he's got his hands up like what the
24:45 [ __ ] is that what you really want are
24:49 you so [ __ ] Xanax doubt that you
24:52 can't thank for your [ __ ] self and
24:53 you have this archetype in your brain of
24:55 what is presidential give me a [ __ ]
24:57 break and he's right because I know what
25:01 I'm doing these doesn't know I know the
25:04 words that I choose I know when I'm
25:06 reading off the teleprompter I know what
25:07 I'm speaking for myself fake news is so
25:13 monumentally important to understand
25:15 because it is the control apparatus to
25:17 make NPCs look normal right
25:22 how could you have a bunch of [ __ ]
25:23 weirdos running the world who seem to
25:25 eat children a duel saw their word [ __ ]
25:28 yeah you little flaw in their software
25:32 we're gonna get into possessive NPCs in
25:34 just a second so you're David Icke fans
25:37 it's popcorn but listen to the fake news
25:41 talk to you in broadcasts peak right I
25:44 just used to talk about this all the
25:45 time and season wanted to they talk to
25:47 you like this now the healing can begin
25:50 everything is a pun that's not [ __ ]
25:56 real life why the [ __ ] would you turn
25:58 the television on and allow that [ __ ] to
26:00 go into your brain and when I say [ __ ]
26:04 to go into your brain I mean that
26:05 literally you're just opening up a sieve
26:09 and putting it into your head and just
26:11 putting just crap into your brain don't
26:18 watch cable television I mean it's all
26:21 agendas and crap to [ __ ] with your brain
26:24 to scold you if you so much as wake up
26:27 right and if you go back to the
26:31 experiment the idea would be we're gonna
26:33 try to keep you because we want to hear
26:37 the mouse say [ __ ] you I won't do what
26:39 you tell me you know we wanted to turn
26:41 into Rage Against the Machine Mouse and
26:43 just say out of here and then you know
26:49 there hold the mouse in their hand
26:50 they're lab rat and they're like we got
26:52 one and that means we have one that can
26:55 think for itself we have one that it's a
26:57 superhero that says I am NOT putting up
26:59 with this [ __ ] anymore I am taking my TV
27:03 and I'm disconnecting cable I might
27:07 watch my favorite movie that I got on a
27:09 DVD that inspires me that makes me feel
27:11 better about myself or whatever but I'm
27:15 not watching anything that broadcasted
27:16 at me a politician has to be real a
27:19 politician has to have integrity we have
27:23 so many politicians oh my god the Maxine
27:26 Waters she just walks around trying to
27:29 divide the country she's pulling the
27:32 race card out right she's pulling
27:33 everything out she possibly can
27:35 because their captors are pissed and
27:38 they're about to lose total [ __ ]
27:40 control and it's crazy how these
27:42 [ __ ] have more money than God
27:44 and they won't let go
27:46 they gotta have more right hey take your
27:49 giant you know Pelosi take your giant
27:52 money-laundering scheme of selling
27:54 weapons to Isis through North Korea and
27:56 take your two hundred million dollars
27:58 you've made doing that and go [ __ ] off
28:01 somewhere you know just bow out and
28:05 leave take your dentures and go right
28:09 John McCain did that guy need to be
28:13 president for 10 billion years no but
28:15 that piece of [ __ ] is knows that as soon
28:17 as he's dead the only thing that's gonna
28:19 be remembered about that piece of [ __ ]
28:21 is that he gave up all the secrets to
28:24 the Vietcong pretending like he didn't
28:26 came back and became a [ __ ] war hero
28:28 and then blocked most the mi A&P o/w
28:32 investigations so people could find
28:34 their loved ones over there because his
28:36 confession records are sitting right
28:37 next to the records of their family
28:39 members and he doesn't want you to find
28:40 them now whether or not an MPC is always
28:43 plugged into the mainframe
28:45 oh that it's a live streaming situation
28:48 where they're like getting new
28:49 programming ok sixth graders I have to
28:51 go I can't talk without a teleprompter
28:54 I am Barack Obama Jew I don't know I
28:57 don't know if they have a little bit of
28:59 a tongue otamatone power to go on their
29:02 own and the funny thing is that they you
29:08 know this theory doesn't have to be
29:09 necessarily true for us to say they act
29:13 like [ __ ] robots don't they they are
29:16 so inhuman that they could pass for our
29:20 West world robot so boy that's making
29:24 politicians right away right so the idea
29:27 that it's Westworld and they're all
29:28 being programmed they have narratives
29:31 programmed into them is sort of
29:34 incongruent with their behavior right if
29:38 that was the case then Hillary Clinton
29:40 would have lost the election and taken
29:42 it like an adult and [ __ ] off
29:44 somewhere but no she runs around like
29:47 literally a [ __ ] little girl
29:49 she's an insult to any feminist movement
29:52 on planet earth where we want to promote
29:56 strong females no she's simply using her
29:59 name and her pay-to-play relationships
30:03 to run around the world and complain
30:05 about why she lost I mean it is almost
30:07 two years now and she is still writing a
30:09 new book about this is why I really lost
30:11 which completely contradicts the last
30:13 two books that I wrote about why I
30:14 really lost and unreal she's gonna sink
30:18 that whole party it's a fantastic moment
30:21 in reality no it seems a little more
30:24 organic than that doesn't it they seem
30:26 more flawed than their NPC behavior but
30:31 now we would talk about MPC's in a pure
30:34 video game form to be honest pletely
30:38 compromised completely program
30:39 completely staged everything is the
30:42 script everything is a teleprompter even
30:44 if it's just inside their eyelids hmm
30:47 what if it isn't that pure the
30:50 have a theory now isn't there and it's
30:52 old it's an old theory and again there's
30:57 a little bit of proof that people
30:58 believe in this theory in fact there's a
31:01 hell of a lot of proof to be honest with
31:02 you
31:03 they say the theory is well all I said
31:08 just now just so it's just a reiterate
31:10 is there's proof that people believe
31:11 this is real who are in positions of
31:15 power okay there's this possession
31:19 theory and what's interesting about it
31:23 is that I think if I said to you okay
31:25 we're a five sense creature we have a
31:28 consciousness and to the degree you
31:29 engage your consciousness is to is to
31:32 the degree you have a natural barrier to
31:34 being possessed you become a lot more
31:36 difficult to mess with and it could also
31:41 be that someone has some technology they
31:43 could just point at you and then they
31:45 can give you thoughts of a certain kind
31:46 it's a bit of a stretch but you never
31:48 know hundred-year theory right but david
31:52 icke the former professional soccer or
31:57 football goalie as they like to say over
31:58 their turn
31:59 newscaster sportscaster turned
32:02 conspiracy overlord of UK has been
32:09 pushing the narrative that he did a
32:11 bunch of research around the world and
32:12 what a bunch of books about it that they
32:17 have always believed that reptilians a
32:20 reptilian race of humanoids as
32:24 participated in the creation of man some
32:28 people believe that there's nothing else
32:30 they're sort of the intellectual
32:31 overlords over our world and just to put
32:38 a footnote in there when you buy a David
32:39 Icke book there's all this amazing flow
32:42 in his books that is exciting you're
32:44 like oh my god oh my god oh my god I
32:46 didn't realize that didn't realize that
32:47 right
32:48 like I say over and over and those that
32:50 he really did apparently a job at
32:53 discovering the fact that virtually
32:56 every culture has some phase in its
32:59 development where they worshipped
33:01 reptilians okay and
33:04 that word doesn't click with you if
33:06 you're just new to this but like the all
33:08 the Asian cultures were worshipping
33:10 dragons right dragons air reptilians all
33:15 of the Pharaohs you know who were kings
33:17 they had the Cobra over their third eye
33:20 if there is anything more blatant than a
33:22 reptilian being involved with your inner
33:25 consciousness I don't know what is right
33:27 you have again the statues that surround
33:31 the properties of the British royal
33:34 family that have a reptilian that's a
33:38 part of a female body so it's a female
33:41 sitting down on a stone but behind her
33:44 is a reptilian that blends in with their
33:46 body that seems to be holding her that
33:50 for me is confirmation that at least
33:52 they believe that in some lower way if
33:56 not it being completely true that they
33:58 are actively participating in this right
34:02 from a scientific standpoint I do have
34:04 an episode on the reptilian theory you
34:08 know we see insects all the time that
34:10 are sort of parasitic they lay eggs
34:15 inside other you know
34:19 insects like I think the tarantula hawk
34:22 doesn't it sting the tarantula and lay
34:25 eggs inside the tarantula I mean there's
34:28 a bunch to do that's where they got the
34:30 idea for the movie alien the
34:33 chestburster we know that cats give
34:38 their owners a disease in their brain
34:40 that makes them like cats convincing and
34:44 they think it stems from the fact that
34:45 if you if they could infect a rat colony
34:48 with this disease it's through the feces
34:50 as rats eat feces so it comes out of the
34:53 cat's body into their feces the rats eat
34:56 the feces and then the rats no longer
34:58 observe the cat as a predator and so the
35:01 cat has infinite protein supply by
35:04 eating the rats that don't view them as
35:06 a threat probably for that last few
35:09 seconds they see it as a threat but you
35:11 did before you know it right so this
35:14 notion that we don't have some sort of
35:15 symbiotic predator in the universe that
35:19 is unseen well maybe it's because it's
35:23 unseen that we can't conceive of it a
35:25 lot of us right are gonna us but the
35:29 public at large right and there's a
35:31 rumor that princes died used to call the
35:33 royal family the lizard people I think
35:35 that's interesting it's just a rumor
35:38 but it's a good one for the conspiracy
35:40 itself for those of us that believe the
35:43 princess died was murdered
35:45 due to especially the blue paint
35:47 transfer in the upper right corner panel
35:48 of the car I believe its upper right but
35:51 it's one of the quarter panels of the
35:52 car it went underneath the the bridge
35:55 she was gonna marry Dodi Fayed
35:58 son she was gonna tell all about their
36:00 potentially their pedophile scheme with
36:03 Jimmy Savile she's murdered they put the
36:07 Statue of Liberty's hand Queen Semiramis
36:10 the moneychangers on the overpass over
36:14 her death where they killed her
36:16 signifying we did this and if you [ __ ]
36:18 with us this is what's gonna happen to
36:21 you but now she has two children
36:23 we were grown adults now okay you mean
36:27 to tell me they don't know the
36:28 conspiracy of their mother being
36:30 murdered or the son
36:32 is it Henry yeah it's William and Henry
36:35 right Henry is the one that is the son
36:37 of the bodyguard the redheaded bodyguard
36:42 looks just like his dad so you know his
36:47 mother's murdered probably in part
36:50 because he existed by not Charles's DNA
36:54 and you mean to tell me these kids have
36:57 no critical thinking with with an
36:59 impeccable education let's hope and
37:01 they're not looking at their dad going
37:02 you [ __ ] killed mom really I mean
37:06 what do they have to say what thing did
37:07 they say that to these kids ago well son
37:10 it just had to happen you know that's
37:12 just the way we do it you're you're in
37:15 different status from the rest of the
37:17 world what we do kill our own kind if
37:19 they don't behave so behave son cuz you
37:22 could be next right I mean what what do
37:24 they say right you must say something
37:27 you tell me these kids haven't been
37:29 online to see the conspiracies of it all
37:32 maybe I do like the fact they seem to
37:37 enjoy their status in life where their
37:40 father always kind of seemed to hate
37:42 every minute of his life right but the
37:45 theory back to our story here is that
37:49 perhaps if it's an intelligent race of
37:52 course these and again reptilian
37:56 whatever you know I've never seen a
37:58 reptilian person so it's really stems
38:01 again from Carl Sagan's whole emphasis
38:04 on the R factor brain which is a more
38:06 robotic mind of logic you know the
38:11 scariest thing in the [ __ ] world is
38:12 having a robot like a Robby the Robot
38:16 which is infinitely infinitely powerful
38:18 but he has some predatorial programming
38:21 in him rape he's like a exterminate
38:23 exterminate he's like a Dalek that he
38:26 just goes around the world killing
38:27 humans and you can't stop them there's
38:29 no rationale he just kills he means
38:31 you'd have to hit him with like a JDM
38:34 rocket just to Denham you know so if you
38:38 have
38:40 some sort of consciousness-based race
38:43 that is out of view they can exist
38:46 around us and they could manipulate us
38:50 because to us the brain is very
38:55 mysterious right I'm not saying they can
38:59 possess your soul I'm just saying your
39:01 vessel your $0.05 system can be
39:04 possessed because to them it's like
39:05 Legos are like yeah whatever this is
39:07 like first grade stuff maybe this is
39:10 their experiment their experiment mmm no
39:15 one likes to think that you're that your
39:17 host or I guess your Creator is somehow
39:22 indignant to your suffering but you know
39:28 there's scientists out there that
39:29 perform all kinds of experiments on dogs
39:31 and monkeys and rats and mice they have
39:34 no emotions they're only there because
39:36 they have a left brain dominant system
39:41 they're not empathetic at all about the
39:44 suffering or they've maybe rationalized
39:46 it to the point they are saying well for
39:48 the greater good the greater good I need
39:52 to find out if a rat screams when I
39:55 autopsy it live because we know it
39:59 laughs when we tickle its belly but now
40:02 take the whole thing I forgot to finish
40:05 my point about Donald Trump the idea is
40:07 what if Donald Trump and again this is
40:10 not really again every time someone
40:12 mentions Donald Trump you think you know
40:14 I got a mega hat on you know I'd like a
40:17 lot of things these done trust me enough
40:19 true enough cueing on country and on
40:21 that's a nice one well 40 and slip there
40:24 if the cue and on thing is real then I
40:25 love Donald Trump behind your wildest
40:27 dreams okay he could be anybody he could
40:29 be you know the librarian down this
40:33 street is a 21 year old female
40:35 if queueing on is telling the truth in
40:37 it the idea is what if a non-player
40:41 characters finally ascended to
40:42 presidential power and those who run the
40:45 experiment just go oh look at this
40:47 a real one finally made it he's running
40:51 and he actually beat
40:54 all the competition or we pulled the
40:56 system back to make sure he gets a
40:58 chance to win let's just see what one
41:00 human being would really do
41:01 I mean he's more normal than any
41:03 president we've had in ages right flawed
41:06 to beat the band sure he's not flawed in
41:09 any way that makes him the shitty leader
41:10 except for you know Wade talks his self
41:14 congratulatory crap but I always talk
41:15 about drives me nuts that makes me
41:17 cringe but you have these leaders that
41:19 seem to do everything wrong
41:22 constantly again they can't utter a
41:25 single phrase without being
41:27 condescending well what would be the
41:29 voice of a scientist to a lab rat at the
41:33 lab rat could talk I don't want to be in
41:36 this mace well you have to be in this
41:37 space I don't want to be why do I have
41:39 to be in this mess well we're trying to
41:41 figure out how you think well why don't
41:44 you just ask me well it's better this
41:46 way you could lie to us we need to
41:49 figure if you really have the potential
41:51 power that we think you do or don't
41:54 there's the movie the thing by John
41:57 Carpenter the remake of the original one
41:59 which is absolutely masterful I believe
42:02 it's 1981 and they had this for those of
42:07 you not familiar with the story it's a
42:08 bunch of folks in the Antarctica who
42:11 have discovered a crashed UFO and it
42:16 looks as if a previous team from at
42:19 least in the movie I think they're
42:20 Norwegian they discovered the UFO they
42:24 broke into it they may have taken out
42:27 some sort of specimen they revived it
42:30 and it went [ __ ] berserk it's got all
42:34 these powers to emulate our form
42:36 shape-shift reptilian like in theory and
42:39 then the they get essentially wiped out
42:42 at the end and the Norwegians do and
42:45 that's when our movie starts where the
42:46 American team comes down and finds the
42:48 wreckage of this whole thing finds the
42:50 UFO and is like holy [ __ ] not knowing
42:56 that one of the German Shepherds that
42:58 gets loose from the Norwegian team gets
43:00 into the American base and it's one of
43:02 these beings and very shortly after the
43:06 film starts this
43:07 creature starts to mutate and kill all
43:10 the other dogs and infect them and
43:12 spread it's it's goo its life force and
43:16 start simulating human beings so there's
43:20 a point where they know at least one
43:22 person is one of these things the thing
43:28 and so they figure out that well when
43:33 this being is attacked it responds and
43:37 it mutates to save itself and so Kurt
43:41 Russell's character it's what I Kurt
43:43 Russell's best roles ever swear to god
43:45 this guy really found some great escape
43:48 from New York and all this list I found
43:50 some really great roles when he first
43:51 came out as an actor he finds that he's
43:56 like look let's cut everyone's hand and
43:58 you'll pull all your blood into this
43:59 feature dish and then I'm gonna heat up
44:03 with a flamethrower a copper wire and
44:08 I'm gonna touch the blood in the petri
44:11 dish with this copper wire and it's
44:13 going to react and they got these guys
44:16 all strapped down into these chairs and
44:20 three of them and you know two of them
44:23 are like you know all of them are like
44:25 hey I don't want to be strapped down you
44:28 know cuz what if you find out the guy
44:30 who can right next to me is one of these
44:32 things he's gonna kill me and whatever
44:34 stupid reason they don't try to fix that
44:37 problem but the first couple are duds
44:41 the blood simply burns and I don't know
44:45 third one or whatever
44:46 [ __ ] happens okay and these guys are
44:49 strapped next to this other dude and
44:51 they're all trying to get free but it
44:56 would seem logical that perhaps we could
44:59 create a test that might reveal well
45:04 then I someone's an NPC if they are an
45:06 NPC you've seen this in movie arcs all
45:09 the time but now let's take it down
45:12 let's expand the theory because I would
45:14 I have what I have done in this episode
45:16 so far is absolutely obsessed on the
45:18 notion that politics
45:21 contains the politicians that are more
45:23 of the npc's because it is the focal
45:25 point again of how we behave now the
45:28 funny thing is is you might I mean you
45:33 might know a politician it's in your
45:34 family right and they might be really
45:37 popular help maybe I even mentioned one
45:40 of your family members and the whole
45:42 notion is why no my family members real
45:44 you don't see their empathy but I do all
45:48 I can say is good that's good check them
45:50 off a list of a [ __ ] right but we do
45:53 have this group of people who hurt kids
45:55 and I'm not gonna totally dive off under
45:57 this because it's very it's a very
45:58 acidic subject matter and we all know
46:01 the game are those people that can hurt
46:04 mankind on that level instantaneous you
46:10 know people like this no no it seems
46:14 like it right seems possible right which
46:17 is just interesting is I've been in
46:21 several situations in my lifetime where
46:23 I definitely hang out with or have hung
46:27 out with uber uber nerds they are
46:32 socially awkward and they're the first
46:34 people to tell you that they're socially
46:35 awkward because you know they're inside
46:39 a lot they don't have that you know that
46:43 past of going to parties and being you
46:47 know capable of being the center of
46:49 attention and handling that fluently
46:51 etcetera etcetera it's not that they
46:55 don't have arrogance about what they're
46:57 good at and well earned arrogance in
46:59 some cases they just don't have the life
47:02 experiences that some of us have but
47:06 I'll say this
47:07 they're very human they're very very
47:11 human people when they're younger
47:14 sometimes you run into this quiet ones
47:16 that are so shy they can barely speak
47:18 sometimes you run into the ones that are
47:22 flamboyant and they're nerdiness and
47:26 then you run into the ones that are much
47:27 older that are just lovable and goofy
47:32 and in his
47:33 and and sweet they can't look you in the
47:38 eye for more than a split second but
47:40 they know they need to and so they kind
47:42 of they kind of look about you know okay
47:45 and so I think that we it's I don't know
47:52 I just feel like we can really sense
47:56 subconsciously humanity in a person and
48:00 whether or not this has anything to do
48:02 with any sort of NPC theory there there
48:07 seem to be people that lack humility
48:10 they lack any sort of depth as a human
48:15 being and it's usually very subtle and
48:19 strange right
48:20 anytime I watch Barack Obama speak there
48:26 is a an artificial nature about him
48:29 anytime I see Hillary Clinton speak it's
48:32 pure artificial bizarreness as if she
48:36 care not
48:37 she cares not about what anyone else is
48:39 feeling in the room she's simply trying
48:41 to convince you of something constantly
48:43 you know there needs to be a break of
48:45 humanity in people's nature sometimes
48:50 you can reach a level of status where
48:52 it's impossible to have that break you
48:56 know I'd say Michael Jackson and Prince
48:58 both when interviewed you know neither
49:01 one of them really liked being
49:02 interviewed and mainly because both of
49:05 them understood that they were being
49:06 misquoted constantly I mean imagine that
49:10 imagine that will imagine if they made a
49:14 show like this would have been so much
49:16 easier right
49:17 okay parents sit down talk talk about
49:19 [ __ ] politics talk you know he
49:21 managed to get some be et interviews out
49:24 where he definitely loosened up a little
49:26 bit he's definitely had some interviews
49:28 over the last couple decades of his life
49:30 where you really saw the real Prince
49:32 there was one where they went to this
49:35 black girl who used to be a VJ at MTV I
49:39 forget her damn name I don't want to see
49:41 her name wrong but she went to Paisley
49:43 Park and interviewed him and they spent
49:44 a whole day together and it was the most
49:46 we've
49:47 dealing interview you've ever seen with
49:50 that guy and they went out and hung out
49:51 on a swing set and you just got to see
49:53 the frailty of this guy who's a super
49:56 hero to those of us who like his music
49:59 it was almost kind of disconcerting as a
50:03 fan to go wow he can't really pull off
50:07 being on 24/7 that's good it's good it's
50:11 good that he was human right Michael
50:14 Jackson tried that a couple times and
50:15 never worked out but he had been a
50:19 feeding famous since he was like 5 years
50:21 old I think the overall angst that all
50:25 of us have about theories such as the
50:29 NPC theory is that a lot of us just
50:35 desire to be in a world that isn't
50:38 [ __ ] rigged that's a big undertow
50:43 subplot of the truth through movement is
50:48 true sovereignty in every corner of the
50:53 universe we don't have the grasshoppers
50:56 and the ants as these dramatized in the
50:59 Pixar movie a bug's life you know and
51:03 for those of you who don't you know live
51:04 in America the saddest part about not
51:07 living in America is that I've never
51:11 heard of the the German dream the
51:14 Deutschland dream I've never heard of
51:17 the Britain dream I've never heard of
51:19 the Australian dream or the India dream
51:23 with a Russian dream I've only ever
51:26 heard of the American dream
51:29 and we are chastised by folks for having
51:34 such a [ __ ] notion do you mean the
51:37 American dream well you know what I mean
51:39 we [ __ ] get an education you get good
51:41 at something you get a career in that
51:43 and you can spend your entire life doing
51:45 what you love from the moment you start
51:46 working at the age of 18 so your
51:49 retirement
51:50 whatever 6070 years old whenever you
51:53 choose to get out and [ __ ] you know what
51:54 you can die right over there on the
51:57 lathe if you want to hopefully not
51:59 due to the leaf but you can died your
52:01 house in front of your typewriter
52:02 or whatever polish in a car dreaming up
52:07 some new scientific theory that
52:10 hopefully helps man
52:13 why are we nuts over here for hanging on
52:17 to the dream of freedom sovereignty all
52:21 being incorporated into your employment
52:24 and your overall dream right
52:28 Donald Trump said something in his last
52:31 speech that he was South Carolina that
52:37 is where he was but but I haven't heard
52:41 a president or a leader of any kind say
52:44 in my entire lifetime
52:46 it was the most fundamental right that a
52:49 human being has and he said look there's
52:52 nothing like the feeling of a job well
52:54 done and I want to give the citizens of
52:56 America the vocational capability to
53:00 complete the job of their dreams and the
53:04 project of their dreams over and over
53:07 and over again and I want that to be
53:09 their mechanism for existing on this
53:12 planet love or hate the guy I didn't
53:16 hear any of anyone else running for
53:19 president say that I haven't heard the
53:21 last you know 50 years of presidents say
53:24 that I haven't heard the previous
53:26 several hundred years of presidents say
53:28 that
53:30 sure someone started saying it if you go
53:32 back far enough Jesus Christ how do you
53:36 think it's time that we say it again
53:38 today you know most of the world is
53:41 trying to get welfare to work for
53:43 everyone well my dream is to get a
53:46 paycheck in the mail and go back to
53:48 watching TV to put [ __ ] into my brain
53:50 right if you think about the theory of
53:52 the MPC whether it be real or simply a
53:56 mechanism to define these non empathetic
54:00 politicians it seemed to get into power
54:02 and there's bankers and all kinds of
54:04 folks that have the same role right
54:06 maybe the leaders of militaries right
54:10 for those of you who remember this
54:13 moment I want you to you may not
54:15 remember the exact moment because I'm
54:16 not sure I remember the exact day myself
54:21 if there's a day when you take the
54:23 training wheels off your bike and
54:26 there's nothing more liberating than
54:29 that moment you can't do tricks on your
54:32 you're Mongoose bike with training
54:35 wheels on the back one you look pretty
54:37 stupid doing it but two you can't lean
54:39 your bike over as the training wheels
54:42 are supposed to be there for to keep you
54:43 in a three-wheeler situation if you lean
54:47 over because you can't balance where
54:48 you're just left right left right right
54:50 right left you know NPCs if they were to
54:53 exist would be nothing more than a
54:55 controlling apparatus it might be
54:58 training wheels to get Society started
55:00 but it might also be shackles and chains
55:03 on who we want to be as a race now
55:07 imagine this one maybe throws those
55:09 zinger at you what if our controllers
55:13 are like sort of the gene roddenberry
55:16 world it doesn't really make any sense
55:19 unless we're a completely different
55:22 species than they are but we have a
55:24 similarity or made in their in their
55:27 form whatever they have this weird end
55:30 goal for how society should behave they
55:33 have no currency it is very socialistic
55:37 you do get your job assigned to you and
55:40 you learn to like it and that kind of
55:42 thing right
55:44 think it would be likened very much to
55:46 raising a child there are some parents
55:49 that want their kids to completely take
55:52 over their family tradition their family
55:56 job you know what if you're the
55:58 Firestone company like I used to hang
56:00 out with one of the Firestone sons and I
56:03 first came out to California and I'm
56:06 sitting there we're watching you
56:08 watching [ __ ] racing in this mud track
56:11 in Ventura and we're sitting there
56:14 watching and I'm a little blown away you
56:17 know I'm like I'm sitting here with the
56:18 Firestone kid one of them good-looking
56:21 guy definitely poised to take over the
56:24 family business when it comes time it's
56:26 probably in his mid-20s I'd say but here
56:29 he is waking up to a world where he's
56:32 like my god there's not a single kid I
56:33 know unless he knows the Pirelli kids
56:36 right he's like my family name is all
56:39 over tires
56:42 we sponsor f1 and NASCAR and all these
56:48 different races around the world we sell
56:51 millions of tires to various car
56:54 manufacturers we have outlets all over
56:57 the world it's massive it's a little bit
56:59 different than your mom-and-pop shop
57:01 where you're gonna inherit the shoe shop
57:03 in my hometown so there's an immediate
57:08 benefit to this kid because you know the
57:15 kid was handsome and what have you so
57:16 you wouldn't have had a problem in
57:17 certain territories of life but coming
57:19 in a Multi multi billionaire family than
57:22 hurt right and so his father is most
57:27 likely very very pleased that his son
57:28 could see the value of taking over the
57:30 business and so the algorithm and his
57:32 son's brain is perfect know for you know
57:36 for all intents and purposes he's doing
57:38 he's gonna do what his father wants him
57:40 to that the family wants him to and he's
57:42 probably gonna enjoy it nothing wrong
57:45 with that man that is awesome that is
57:47 freakin awesome we need a lot more of
57:48 that going on for these good meat and
57:51 potato companies right
57:53 but if our captors have the same thing
57:56 for us they're like you know what you'll
57:58 really like this world if you can just
58:01 [ __ ] get to that point where you
58:02 think like this and we've got these NPCs
58:05 down there so that you can get to this
58:08 point and yeah we do create a lot of
58:10 nasty crap in your world because we're
58:11 trying to make you react to it
58:13 so that you pop over to the good nature
58:18 of how the world works or could work
58:21 the sumerians have poetic text that
58:26 talks about how these beings would come
58:30 out of the hills come down and reset
58:32 society elect a leader and then leave
58:35 and then that leader would obviously go
58:37 for a long time die and it would
58:39 rejuvenate for anywhere from three
58:41 hundred to a thousand years and then
58:43 this would happen again I think it's
58:45 fascinating right but if that was true
58:48 who said back at my Flat Earth days what
58:51 of those with the dome owners coming in
58:53 and going aren't I right [ __ ]
58:54 so I'm touching kids all right back
58:58 we're taking you with us cuz you're you
59:00 need to be removed from the dome we know
59:04 what went wrong with you and what have
59:05 you but you can't stick around now
59:08 here's how it's gonna be boom boom boom
59:11 boom boom do you get it yes I get it
59:14 totally we've been waiting for something
59:16 nice - is this too cocky so you could be
59:18 the leader don't [ __ ] around we're gonna
59:20 come back we're taking this dude off to
59:23 get some nice rehabilitation you'll be
59:26 next if you do it again don't even worry
59:28 about it
59:28 we got this again we might have it for a
59:31 couple generations for a few millennia
59:33 or a few centuries and then it might
59:36 crawl back in because power corrupts
59:38 absolutely right now the frustrating
59:41 notion about this last assertion that
59:43 I've made in this final certian that I
59:45 will make is that you know a lot of us
59:49 would probably respond if we can simply
59:52 get the manual on how it should be done
59:55 this is the way it should be done right
59:58 the Georgia Guidestones
60:00 can you imagine if it's the captors
60:03 putting the Georgia Guidestones down
60:06 [ __ ] first thing they say is you know
60:08 what you've overpopulated I don't think
60:13 that's the truth but what if they think
60:14 that take a look if you really want to
60:16 be happy you got to not have so many
60:18 goddamn kids right it dawned on me the
60:23 other day this is a weird thought but
60:27 isn't it interesting that the races that
60:30 barely populate this planet the ones
60:32 that are like the white people of the
60:34 world that are losing their population
60:36 in droves right we're not procreating
60:39 enough we're not having enough children
60:40 we're all [ __ ] self-involved right we
60:43 make all the porn in the world and the
60:47 countries that screw like bunnies and
60:50 have way too many goddamn kids you don't
60:54 see their stuff online
60:56 in fact they typically will have laws in
60:59 their countries where if you're caught
61:00 was pornographic material you can get
61:03 the death penalty not interesting you
61:07 think it'd be the opposite you think why
61:10 people just filmed a golf but now this
61:13 play devil's advocate - this whole
61:15 notion that they wish us well what are
61:17 the Polish politicians of the world
61:19 associated with well I would wager I
61:24 could prove in a court of law
61:26 depopulation poisoning us they seem to
61:33 be almost one-to-one associated with
61:36 molesting our children and killing them
61:40 engaging in human trafficking I think we
61:43 just elected the president one of the
61:46 only guys and the planet that isn't a
61:49 member of a secret society that has no
61:51 record of doing this sort of thing does
61:54 he like the opposite sex oh yes he does
61:56 but there is a war on right now to get
62:02 these people cleaned off the face of the
62:04 planet
62:05 if the npcs have ever been under attack
62:09 it's right now so the npc has to be
62:13 evaluated are they good or are they bad
62:15 if they were to exist I think it was
62:18 funny as we could probably we could
62:21 probably hang on to this NPC label even
62:24 if they don't exist something to
62:26 describe the politician that has no
62:29 empathy the one that you know is best
62:33 buds with Jimmy Savile Jeffrey Epstein
62:37 you know we have the the Grimm's
62:41 brothers who wrote all the German tales
62:46 I wouldn't say all but they wrote you
62:49 know they're the most famous writers for
62:51 these allegorical children's stories
62:57 were in the end the children died in
62:59 almost every single case right Little
63:03 Red Riding Hood did not get away right
63:05 Hansel and Gretel got eaten okay
63:09 it was Walt Disney that took all those
63:11 stories and made them positive at the
63:12 end I don't think it's a big stretch
63:15 that we don't want these people running
63:17 our world I think we have enough people
63:20 that can understand how this works and I
63:24 think we might be in the 2018 Awakening
63:26 might simply be the replacement of these
63:28 individuals with real human beings
63:30 because we're starting to hivemind
63:33 due to the internet our natures to
63:36 understand them we don't we're not going
63:41 to have a moment I should say where the
63:42 manual is given to us but it would seem
63:46 that mankind is reaching a point where
63:48 we're starting to do the traditional
63:51 phrase the traditional methodology which
63:54 is that we are hive mining the manual
63:56 through vocal means which is you know
64:00 you know for those of you believe in the
64:02 Bible being true the the story was that
64:04 it was passed down orally for a long
64:06 time and finally written down so several
64:09 centuries after Christ's supposed to
64:12 death right well in a real way we're
64:15 really doing that right now we're
64:17 combining our
64:18 our notes and you know they are out
64:22 there distant lowing the [ __ ] out of
64:23 things you have you have disinfo
64:27 happening and this is something's really
64:29 been a revelation last couple weeks here
64:31 in spring of 2018 I think we're almost
64:36 in summer now but the idea is that we
64:39 have egos out there that don't want to
64:41 share airtime with the truth and they
64:45 are struggling to deduce the truth and
64:48 so the the big game that's being played
64:51 is don't pay attention to him pay
64:52 attention to me and it has nothing to do
64:55 with a true goal of finding honesty
64:59 right I think we need to work to that
65:06 end where we really lay down some law
65:09 you know I mean again like I'm just
65:13 gonna go for a very specific thing
65:14 because I think it's important and I get
65:16 specific comments about it
65:17 you won't see me cross over into this
65:19 realm that often but the idea that Alex
65:22 Jones of all people is not reporting on
65:24 cue and when he does he reports on it
65:27 through a proxy and recently there was a
65:30 mistake on the a Tran boards that a
65:34 password was exposed and which is
65:38 unbelievable it's one of these things
65:40 like if you're in public and you're
65:42 logging into your phone you accidentally
65:43 type your password in the username field
65:45 it's not turned into dots and if
65:47 anyone's standing over your shoulder
65:48 they can see what your password is right
65:50 you make that mistake probably you know
65:52 once every couple of years this is what
65:54 happened in a trance someone typed in
65:56 the password and hit submit and it went
65:57 on as a post you felt like what the [ __ ]
66:00 does that mean I didn't see it
66:01 personally but they cleaned it up real
66:03 quick were you secured to everything and
66:06 said to the public we made a mistake we
66:09 accidentally published the password it's
66:10 now all been re-encrypted it's all safe
66:14 and anything posted as a result of that
66:16 account after that point was erased we
66:18 make mistakes too but that was drummed
66:21 up by Alex Jones as being they were
66:23 compromised and he knows who all the
66:25 Cubans are and he has inside information
66:27 also stuff so since October of 2017
66:32 q and on dude has been predicting the
66:34 future like a goddamn fortune teller now
66:40 some of it isn't that but he doesn't
66:42 acclaim that a lot in fact he doesn't
66:44 claim look at me I've been able to
66:46 predict everything but he does make pose
66:48 to say look you've been able to verify
66:53 that the things that I told you were
66:55 gonna happen happened and they happened
66:56 when I said it was gonna happen and it
66:57 happened the way I said it would happen
66:59 he's also been releasing some insight
67:02 photographs that show how close he is to
67:04 the president by photographing desks and
67:09 you know so very close items to say look
67:11 not gonna give you too much information
67:13 but look this is how close I am
67:15 he's also predicted some things that
67:17 haven't been released some photographs
67:20 that need to be released so he's not
67:23 perfect maybe they changed their mind
67:26 maybe they're just baiting maybe they're
67:28 just trying to scare people and again
67:29 this whole thing could come out in the
67:31 end and be a ruse you know live-action
67:34 role-playing exercise but currently his
67:37 record since October and again I've
67:39 warned you guys that there is a
67:41 methodology of releasing truth for a
67:44 little while and then flipping it in
67:46 screwing everyone at the end right where
67:48 you're you're totally burned by dis info
67:54 at the end of a strand of comments that
67:56 started out true and then they they
67:58 baited us in you know what have you so
68:01 far it's been the only source of
68:04 information that has explained
68:05 everything that is unexplainable in this
68:07 planet but it would seem that you know
68:11 at this point in my life I really do
68:12 think Alex Jones has been totally
68:13 compromised whether it be his ego that
68:15 allows them to be compromised or he has
68:17 truly been visited by black states that
68:18 said here's what you're gonna do and
68:21 here's what you here's what you're going
68:22 to get for what you do
68:24 and again if he is part of the problem
68:27 if he has been hiding in the mezzanine
68:29 between truth or movement and the clowns
68:33 then he is going to do everything in his
68:35 power to discredit those that are going
68:37 to expose him so he has maneuvered
68:42 himself in my opinion in the truth
68:43 movement right under the crosshairs of
68:47 evaluation being executed or anything
68:50 but he keeps saying he has all these
68:52 insiders but he never predicts anything
68:55 right he'll say he has an article that
68:58 proves something and it's from his own
69:00 website
69:00 well how [ __ ] convenient is that
69:03 right that's like me making an episode
69:05 talking about a previous episode and
69:07 saying there's proof on the internet
69:09 that this is true there's videos out
69:11 there that tell you how it works and
69:13 you're talking about myself that's a
69:17 [ __ ] Ponzi scheme if you've ever
69:18 seen one in the truth movement right
69:20 whatever we're doing we're doing more
69:23 things right now in the truth move it
69:24 then we're doing wrong we over evaluate
69:28 too much and we do persecute heroes from
69:32 time to time you know I think it's a
69:36 process I think that you know if I were
69:40 to come out and say anything outrageous
69:41 about what's going on in the world and
69:44 what-have-you
69:45 then I expect to have the same criticism
69:47 on me the same evaluation on me but I
69:52 try to steer away from that crap because
69:53 I feel like well you're gonna get that
69:55 from somebody else I don't need to go
69:57 out there and talk about dark stuff I'm
70:00 more interested in your brain I'm more
70:02 interested in the well it's what's funny
70:05 is what I have been trying to do over
70:06 the last three years Q has done in I
70:11 don't know ten months eight months
70:14 whatever I guess it's probably about
70:16 eight months getting all these folks to
70:20 do what they call the the autistic
70:24 version of their brain to grow it which
70:26 is to analyze things to deduce things
70:30 and to work together you know again most
70:33 of people that follow Q and on are very
70:34 young people
70:35 that's very exciting for me we can't let
70:38 it turn into paranoia and hysteria you
70:42 have to pause if you count to ten before
70:45 we launch a intellectual ICBM at someone
70:49 I think there's a little bit of give the
70:54 person the benefit of the doubt while
70:56 you are evaluating and while you're
70:58 being critical of them it's very very
71:01 important
71:02 NPCs well let's keep talking about it
71:07 let me know your thoughts in the comment
71:09 section
71:10 apparently there's a movement online for
71:12 this so feel free to post other videos
71:14 about this in the comments section I'll
71:16 prove everything thank you in some of
71:20 your posts when you post videos will be
71:22 flagged and held if you're a person
71:24 that's trying to spread truth and you
71:26 think you have a bombshell of a video
71:28 either one you've made or when you've
71:30 found and you're posting it all over
71:31 everyone's channel YouTube will mark you
71:34 as a potential spammer especially if
71:36 someone on the other channel doesn't
71:38 appreciate your efforts and they mark
71:40 you as a spammer as a potential spammer
71:43 it will mark it for me that way and I
71:45 have to evaluate it so what I'll
71:47 typically do is you'll post that if it
71:49 gets held I might be in my car might be
71:52 doing something might be traveling and I
71:54 don't have a chance to watch it one of
71:56 the bummers is that the YouTube app that
72:00 helps us manage our channels when you
72:01 click a link it doesn't go anywhere and
72:04 so I have to get stationary somewhere my
72:07 laptop my own computer and then I can go
72:10 to the the master control panel in
72:13 YouTube and then I can click it and
72:14 watch it to see that it's not some nut
72:16 bag thing right and you know even if I
72:19 totally disagree with what you say it's
72:21 marked your property so even if you're
72:24 off in some tangent that I don't
72:27 understand or agree with I'll still let
72:29 it go through it's it's your property
72:30 it's your opinion that's fine with me
72:32 totally fine with me but if you're
72:34 trying to promote your buddies Rock
72:35 video I'm not gonna let that through if
72:38 you're trying to sell a product I'm not
72:39 gonna let that go through it has nothing
72:41 to do with our conversation but as long
72:42 as it's remotely on target or even if
72:45 you're like hey you should check this
72:46 out boom it has you know it's like a
72:47 loose connection
72:49 the episode I'll let it go through okay
72:52 s once you know the bowels works you
72:54 don't think I'm being some censorship

72:59 thoughts radio calm please go there's
73:02 audio video a lock facebook group and a
73:04 patreon page make a quick bumper today

73:09 I've seen the next deep thoughts
73:13 [Music]
73:31 so I have a string of lights hanging in
73:33 my porch er but I got hummingbirds
73:37 everywhere and this little hummingbird
73:40 has landed he's pretty young I could see
73:44 his little tongue coming out of his
73:45 really long beak
73:46 it's crazy he's bathing himself on this
73:50 light strip up here so he's uh he's
73:55 picking his furs at the tongue sticking
73:57 out he's getting his belly cleanest
74:00 waiting so my god he's actually like
74:03 leaning around his neck which is unreal
74:06 so what he has done is he used the wire
74:11 that the lights are on to clean his beak
74:13 and he actually was wiping his beak on
74:15 the wire left right left right left
74:17 right he did it to his right and then he
74:20 turned and did it to his left absolutely
74:23 little majestic buggers he keeps
74:28 cleaning his chest plate right
74:30 underneath his chin which makes him wide
74:32 his head hey Dad hope he just lets him
74:35 go there I think about how fast that
74:39 they move and think him spitting that
74:43 much time up there is probably an hour
74:45 for him I'll put that at the end
