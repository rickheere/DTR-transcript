00:02 [Music]
00:23 you
00:24 [Music]
00:34 welcome back ladies and gentlemans to
00:36 deep thoughts today I thought we would
00:41 review sort of the base mechanic which
00:46 allows those who deceive us and those
00:53 who steal from us to continue their game
00:56 on and on and on how we love fakery if
01:01 you're having fun let me throw out Jesus
01:06 way let's say you want to understand why
01:08 society accepts fakery you simply have
01:13 to look at the alternative what is the
01:18 alternative to fakery probably be
01:24 something in the lines of honesty right
01:29 it would be taking the world as it is
01:33 and maybe that is so boring for some
01:37 people that they're kind of like you got
01:41 anything else you got anything else you
01:44 got some drugs right and Nessa and GPL
01:49 go oh yeah sit back and relax baby now
01:54 what we're going to tell you might be
01:55 true and might be false but in the end
01:59 it's gonna be entertaining it's
02:01 guaranteed to have some fakery what do
02:04 you care
02:04 you're trying to be entertained right so
02:10 now when I say how we love NASA fakery
02:15 some of you most of you loyalists and
02:18 truthers this is not your mantra but
02:23 this is sort of a rhetorical
02:24 conversation of how enough people
02:28 believe that that we now are seeing
02:33 missions that don't occur but they say
02:38 they occur Rockets it blast off and
02:42 don't really reach their destination but
02:46 we pay for it to reach the destination
02:49 and quite frankly you know what if NASA
02:53 said you get deep into the bowels of the
02:55 truth you know the upper management
02:58 that's one to tell you the truth and
02:59 they say to you all right you know
03:02 you're claiming that you're paying to
03:04 get a probe to Mars and there could be
03:07 nothing more far from the truth if we
03:11 were truly to get the technology
03:13 developed to get to Mars or the moon or
03:15 whatever the bill would be a million
03:18 times higher so you're not paying for
03:20 that so don't worry whatever a hundred
03:23 million dollars billion dollars or
03:25 whatever it takes to launch something
03:27 it's just to get into low orbit to do
03:30 something completely different
03:32 potentially nefarious I hate using that
03:35 word nowadays nefarious in the truth
03:37 movement is like the word ecstasy to a
03:40 junior poem writer why do we watch
03:44 science fiction movies you know I can
03:47 watch 2001 Space Odyssey at least once a
03:51 year and I can get into the storyline
03:55 and really enjoy that but I can also
03:57 subtract the storyline and get into the
04:00 the the beautiful depiction of the
04:05 future technology that may or may not
04:08 exist right someone's got a resurrect
04:09 Pan Am airlines but you know the wheel
04:13 and space and that beautiful you know
04:15 craft that went up to dock with it I
04:17 mean it was so well conceived it was
04:19 ridiculous the moonbase the the Hal 9000
04:24 being a brilliant AI the pod technology
04:28 the Odyssey is in there too but of
04:30 course we like to see the culmination I
04:36 believe of human minds that get together
04:38 to to do our very best our science
04:43 fiction best right science fiction I
04:46 mean for the folks that don't read it
04:48 it is the scientifically accurate
04:50 version of the story sci-fi science
04:54 fantasy is where you get your Star Wars
04:56 where it doesn't really matter what's
04:58 proposed what's propelling the
04:59 Millennium
04:59 or how the Death Star's put together
05:02 right I think for a lot of us especially
05:06 this year of 2018 and seeing a new you
05:11 know earth mover show up with metric
05:15 tons of complete [ __ ] coming out of
05:17 these organizations that claim to be
05:20 going to Mars and doing deep-space
05:22 exploration you know putting
05:24 reconnaissance satellites around some of
05:26 our planets claiming to get you know
05:31 Telugu
05:32 telemetry and data from the Voyager
05:36 satellites which were launched in the
05:38 70s I mean at some point you know it
05:43 just starts to stink to high heaven and
05:45 you know maybe one or two of those
05:47 things are real and the rest are all
05:49 fake you know but once you start
05:51 inserting lies into truth then you know
05:56 it's the boil call wolf you can't trust
05:58 anything that they say right because if
06:02 you do you can lose everything let me
06:05 ask you guys this if I said to you I
06:09 come to your house and I pick you guys
06:12 up say hop in the car man I got this
06:14 really big SUV I got a I got a cool bus
06:18 a little concert bus and I'm gonna take
06:22 you to my laboratories and I'm gonna
06:24 show you some technology that I've
06:26 developed and it will I've already been
06:30 to the moon I've already been to Mars
06:32 I have technology that I could put on
06:34 you such that you can actually walk
06:36 outside and just like the force field in
06:39 dune and the movie dune you don't need a
06:43 spacesuit it completely protects you
06:45 with electromagnetic field you can step
06:48 onto the moon step on to Mars in fact we
06:54 can drive this spacecraft right through
06:56 the Sun I can show you the interior
06:59 blackness of the Sun pretty cool right
07:03 that is something that makes us excited
07:08 we have an addiction to patterns in this
07:11 world like you
07:12 already know and when someone introduces
07:16 a whole new world literally then you can
07:19 conceive of quite quickly at least on a
07:21 subliminal wave inside your mind of a
07:24 new place where everything could be one
07:27 to physically new but to any of the
07:29 paradigms in this world that you're
07:31 tired of taxes and divorce or you know
07:34 whatever the hell it is speed limits it
07:37 starts to go away and of course you're
07:39 normally pretty blind to what the new
07:42 threats are in the new place until you
07:44 find out but you want to take that risk
07:46 right some folks are willing to buck
07:51 Elon Musk just recently said he'll send
07:54 himself to Mars and of course he died
07:57 just getting out of orbit but whatever
07:58 he's gonna he said he's likelihood the
08:01 seal died on Mars right okay so but
08:06 let's just say he could do it he could
08:08 get his body to Mars physically he's
08:10 gonna be long dead before he gets there
08:11 unless he develops technology that
08:13 doesn't exist let's just say he can step
08:16 out there and we just watch him on
08:17 camera just fall down dies of radiation
08:20 poisoning
08:21 starvation whatever certain guys are
08:25 willing to do that because they know
08:27 that they'll be in the history books as
08:29 the first human being to set foot on
08:30 Mars that's good enough for them it's
08:34 sort of like well my life kinda was a
08:36 rough rough and tough experience but at
08:40 least in the end I got in history books
08:41 that's why a lot of serial killers do
08:43 what they do right that's why we can't
08:47 I think afford to glorify things that we
08:50 don't want to repeat we simply teach the
08:54 archetype of what they did and you know
08:58 I almost think bury their name so you
09:00 can eat you'll never know the Son of Sam
09:01 he just buried guys erased now what he
09:04 did isn't erased that's taught and
09:08 hopefully even get to some solutions in
09:09 those areas but space is so alluring
09:13 isn't it you know one again if it exists
09:18 right
09:21 no for the sake of this conversation I
09:25 think that we should we should just go
09:28 ahead with the basic normal
09:30 understanding of the universe because it
09:32 would get really esoteric if we don't
09:35 what I have discovered is that all of
09:38 the brilliant people that I have studied
09:40 from medical professors to you know
09:46 state-of-the-art electromagnetic
09:48 cosmologists or Electrical cosmologists
09:51 right Electrical universe folks right
09:54 the world is terrified to hear new ideas
09:59 they really are and it's so sad and so
10:02 weird scientists right they they'll hear
10:11 that they're wrong and they won't allow
10:13 that information to be presented we see
10:18 all these pictures of space supposedly
10:21 by NASA and I mean the most basic
10:25 high-altitude photograph right and I've
10:29 been forgetting to mention I think maybe
10:31 I mentioned it in one episode but let's
10:33 we need to insert it into a purely NASA
10:36 based episode which is there have been
10:39 these kids who have put cameras on
10:43 weather balloons and put them way up in
10:47 the air having the unit that goes up
10:50 they're transmitted to the ground and I
10:53 think that I want to say I don't want to
10:57 get this wrong but it was definitely
10:58 over a hundred thousand feet in the air
11:01 on one particular occasion and it was
11:03 extremely clear that the stars were very
11:07 visible in this camera but when you see
11:11 any launch from NASA you never see any
11:15 stars right now I can't remember there
11:18 was the guy in Utah that launched the
11:21 rocket up in the air and he was just
11:24 doing a rocket experiment but it was
11:25 then inducted into the Flat Earth folks
11:27 because they saw the moon off to the
11:30 right when the moon's literally that day
11:32 on the other side of the of the
11:33 earth right so shouldn't be anyway on in
11:37 scientific sense that you could see the
11:39 moon and the guy who built the rocket
11:40 was like what like holy [ __ ] now I never
11:43 heard him follow up then some other guy
11:46 was gonna launch a rocket to prove it
11:48 was flat or whatever and it's like come
11:49 on folks you you would have to develop a
11:52 Saturn 5 ish rocket to go straight up
11:55 but without any curvature in order to
11:59 even remotely get to that capability but
12:02 whatever so my reason for mentioning
12:07 this is that we have seen stars in
12:09 amateur high altitude photography and
12:15 then there are you know the ones where
12:19 the people advertise I'll take a Big Mac
12:22 and put it on something right and they
12:23 ship it up up in the sky and I don't
12:25 believe I've seen stars in those shots
12:28 the ISS has no stars
12:30 none of the photographs so the moon have
12:34 any stars Michael Collins says he didn't
12:36 see any stars when he got back and did
12:38 the press release and then when he wrote
12:41 a book according to Bart Saburo because
12:44 I hadn't read the book he said he saw
12:46 incredible fields of stars because it's
12:49 almost like he thought at the room was
12:51 like well of course we would have seen
12:52 stars now maybe wouldn't I don't know if
12:55 the electrical universe guys are right
12:59 then again you can't see stars unless
13:01 you're bouncing off an atmosphere but
13:02 then again we get up we get obsessed
13:06 with these little things that we find
13:07 out right so 2001 Space Odyssey was
13:10 brilliant in in that it held back sound
13:12 they there's a horrible thing that keeps
13:18 getting repeated and it's repeated out
13:20 of context and it's not updated in
13:23 context which is that the space is a
13:25 vacuum right there's a lot of videos on
13:28 YouTube right now as of December 2018
13:30 people lamenting about the fact that
13:32 there's several several different stages
13:34 of a vacuum and NASA can only simulate
13:37 one that's about in the center and not
13:38 even completely simulated and so they
13:43 are debating whether or not space could
13:46 be
13:47 truly a vacuum which it can't write you
13:51 know II throw particles if you just want
13:53 to understand the universe think of the
13:56 tiniest particle traveling 50 times the
13:58 speed of light it has no charge positive
14:00 or negative it behaves just like water
14:02 as it is below so too is above let's go
14:06 that way but they they talk about this
14:11 vacuum all the time okay well we know
14:13 that there's a radiation coming off of
14:16 the Sun that hits us and warms us in the
14:19 summertime so why NASA would ever say
14:22 that it's a vacuum why anyone would ever
14:24 say it's a vacuum is beyond me now it
14:28 might be a vacuum
14:29 aka devoid of certain particles right
14:34 maybe it doesn't have oxygen maybe it
14:38 doesn't have any particle family that
14:43 allows for light to bounce in the way it
14:47 does such that we can see the light but
14:51 the problem is this there are too many
14:55 atmospheres that exist for an astronaut
14:59 in a suit in space and again we don't
15:05 hear this thing that now you know
15:08 astronauts say they can see stars but
15:09 when they take a picture they can't see
15:11 them because the camera has a different
15:12 situation all right
15:13 the camera I believe has its own little
15:15 atmosphere as well but what is it inside
15:20 the helmet of the astronaut is an
15:22 atmosphere because they can breathe
15:23 right so you have oxygenated air that
15:28 would perform the same function as the
15:31 oxygenated atmosphere here on earth
15:33 right so that's one atmosphere your
15:36 second atmosphere it not made of oxygen
15:39 but made of definitely refracting
15:41 properties is the lens and this and the
15:44 liquids inside your eyeball how do we
15:48 see things we see things because this
15:52 verbal reaction which is a photon right
15:55 it is a transverse wave that is
16:00 coming at you now some electrical
16:02 universe folks want to say it's a
16:04 longitudinal wave so that it's actually
16:07 instantaneous so we don't have any a lot
16:09 of folks can test that there is no time
16:11 delay between a star exploding in space
16:14 and us seeing it right if you here
16:17 Christmas music it's my neighbor
16:18 enjoying Christmas with the kitchen door
16:21 open it's pretty awesome so I think that
16:25 at a minimum when you see stars is going
16:28 to hit the shield go through hit the
16:31 atmosphere that you're breathing and
16:32 then hit your eyeball and then go
16:34 through and press on your cone because
16:38 this verbal reaction this thing that's
16:40 coming at you I don't know that it can
16:41 stop it's carried by the substrate of
16:45 the universe which in my opinion is
16:46 ether you may not think ether exists you
16:50 might believe a couple bogus experiments
16:52 to get rid of it a long time ago to make
16:53 sure the jpmorgan could charge us for a
16:55 unit of electricity but then you have to
16:59 explain how you can see what you believe
17:03 to be Orion's belt
17:04 you know billions of light-years away
17:07 coming to your eyeball here on earth
17:10 there's something out there that's
17:12 carrying the wave of light carrying that
17:15 reaction right it's like a big fat kid
17:17 jumping in a pool boom here comes the
17:19 big splash at your eyeballs if you're
17:22 telling me that it's a vacuum between
17:23 his body and your in your dry body
17:26 sitting on a beach cloth beach blanket
17:31 or whatever then the splash will never
17:34 hit you right and why go over all this
17:37 stuff I think the reason is is that we
17:41 have to understand how much we are
17:44 looking the other way to allow the
17:46 fakery to be true in our minds right
17:50 well you know everyone likes to go see a
17:53 magic show typically right let's share
17:55 grumpy bastard that night
17:58 if it's a good magician some Ricky Jay
18:02 kind of guy my my reading teacher Robert
18:06 McKee he opens up every single class at
18:11 least the core class with a dialogue
18:14 regarding the fact that man needs
18:16 fictional stories to perpetuate and
18:20 sustain humanity all right we need to be
18:24 able to see it in a fictional way such
18:28 that we have the concept to attempt it
18:30 in the first place
18:31 again that old movie I referenced in my
18:33 last moon mission where they you know
18:36 built the bullet and it shoots up and
18:38 hits the moon in the eyeball that is the
18:45 concept being introduced into the minds
18:48 of man such that we would attempt to
18:51 build it
18:52 right other folks had thought up
18:54 multistage rockets in the 1800s right
18:58 understanding that it's going to take a
19:00 motor and a motor and a motor I don't
19:02 know if they had any concept of you know
19:05 the atmosphere getting thinner and
19:08 thinner let me let me touch on a point
19:11 where I made a loose reference to it and
19:13 I want to make sure that as you engage
19:16 in these conversations regarding moon
19:18 travel Mars travel hitting these foreign
19:21 bodies in space that you take this into
19:24 account one the slingshot theory of you
19:31 know that's submitted by NASA that
19:32 somehow just being in orbit around the
19:35 earth gives one this sort of infinite
19:38 rubber band experience right where it
19:40 goes around and around and then shoots
19:42 out has been utterly decimated by
19:44 several scientists okay and some of our
19:47 listeners pointed me at more research
19:49 which just makes it a laughable
19:51 assertion right okay now the moon is a
19:56 big object and so you might be able to
20:00 conceive that getting an orbit around it
20:02 having launched from Earth it's not so
20:04 tough it's a big thing plus the moon
20:07 missions aka the Apollo missions had
20:11 beings inside crafts and so they could
20:13 actually just visually look at the place
20:15 and say more thrust more thrust but
20:19 according to the basic orbital
20:23 assertions of NASA in general the
20:28 altitude that you have to be at to get
20:30 into perfect orbit around any body in
20:32 space is so absolutely precise that a
20:35 human being can't eyeball that it has to
20:37 be controlled by a computer well the
20:39 computer would have to be able to know
20:41 at all times how far away you are from
20:43 this this big giant ball in space that
20:46 you want to be a part of right an
20:49 orbital sense now take Mars and think
20:55 about this notion that one you're gonna
20:57 have to first buy the slingshot theory
20:58 to get out of orbit of Earth which is
21:01 the first level of complete absurdity
21:05 secondly you're gonna have to go towards
21:08 this red dot in space there's no human
21:11 beings on board we know that we have
21:13 never seen a single photograph like a
21:18 guidance system especially back in the
21:20 70s right where it's looking at this red
21:23 dot looking at this red dot get bigger
21:24 and bigger and bigger which is gonna
21:25 happen over a really really long period
21:28 of time and then eventually gets into
21:32 orbit then reduces its orbit then
21:35 parachutes down I mean these the level
21:38 of absolute absurdity and complexity
21:41 it's like it's like to say that in order
21:46 to win the lottery you go at the the
21:50 National lotto which is the Mega Ball
21:51 thing right you got to win that first
21:54 that's getting out of orbit if you win
21:57 that you're able to play the next lotto
22:00 which is exactly the same odds one in a
22:03 billion and that's getting to Mars okay
22:07 just physically getting over to the red
22:10 dot that's another ticket you got to win
22:13 and then to land safely
22:16 you got to play another lotto three X
22:20 right
22:22 a billion to one a billion to one times
22:25 a billion to one and then you get to
22:27 land on the surface now that doesn't
22:30 handle your sustainability your food all
22:34 that stuff right but that's what we're
22:38 supposed to believe over and over and
22:40 over again and we want to believe it in
22:42 one realm even all of you to think that
22:45 NASA's telling lies
22:47 like me we still want to believe those
22:53 assertions those claims and I'm not sure
22:57 that we really deeply care about the
22:59 idea that mankind is doing it I think
23:02 that was a big part of 1969 but for us
23:05 it's just wow
23:08 show me the photographs we've seen movie
23:11 after movie of Mars we've seen video
23:13 games played on Mars so what's it really
23:15 look like how close did we get because
23:18 the assumption is is that you can't you
23:24 can't know what Mars looks like until
23:26 you see it right
23:28 maybe my cigar smoke going in that door
23:32 might make her close the door so I make
23:38 this episode I talk about this well part
23:41 of it so that we understand why when we
23:44 sit across the table from someone who is
23:47 a you know sort of in that still that
23:49 that early stage where they're scared of
23:52 the truth they really are they're just
23:54 absolutely scared of the truth they're
23:56 the lion without the courage they don't
23:59 even want the courage I mean that's the
24:00 funny thing that's the sad part about it
24:02 but you know it's only sad to us outside
24:04 to them but deep down they have this I
24:06 don't knows paralysis that they can't
24:10 talk about it it'll help us understand
24:13 them I think it's also valuable you know
24:18 how many of you have heard the story of
24:20 someone who was an alcoholic helping
24:23 someone else get out of being an
24:25 alcoholic and the way that they were
24:27 able to accomplish it was to say hey I
24:29 know exactly how you feel
24:31 or very similar you're in that stage
24:33 right you feel this this and this and
24:35 they name
24:35 a few things that the other person has
24:37 never heard a non-alcoholic say I like
24:41 oh my god you're yeah I totally feel
24:44 like that you know nobody understands
24:46 and you're like I understand a lot of
24:50 times they'll be an alcoholic kids like
24:52 22 years old talking to a recovering
24:55 alcoholic you is 20 years sorry who
24:59 spent 20 years inside alcoholism they've
25:02 been out for five or ten or whatever and
25:03 so they so intimately understand the
25:06 triggers that make someone want to drink
25:08 right well I don't know about anyone I
25:13 haven't met anyone that I'm sure they're
25:15 out there in droves no because of the
25:17 Millennials and the Gen X Gen Z's but I
25:19 don't know a lot of folks in my age
25:21 bracket who weren't originally nasa fans
25:25 and we're all raw raw GPL nasa that was
25:30 what we wanted to have you know be the
25:32 truth and then we found out oh my god
25:36 you're right this stuff doesn't make
25:38 sense and it's upsetting right but we
25:43 got over it then we got into it right so
25:47 I've definitely run into conversations
25:49 where people again they're interested
25:51 and again I don't I don't push the stuff
25:54 on anyone you know if they want to know
25:56 they want to know and once they open up
25:58 that can of worms then we go into it
26:01 right the question is is you know how do
26:05 we undo ourselves from the fakery isn't
26:11 enough to tell another person hey I
26:13 understand I understand that you want
26:16 this stuff to be real right maybe but
26:24 now here's the other weird question and
26:26 I think there's an answer for us of
26:28 course and we've had the answer for a
26:29 really long time but does it matter that
26:31 this is happening the people are lying
26:34 and that we are robbing the country of
26:40 tens of millions of dollars a day 60 I
26:44 would say 60 that was a number that was
26:46 about four years ago
26:49 that wouldn't be surprised if it's you
26:51 know a hundred but now maybe one of
26:56 these things I mean I don't know I don't
26:58 buy it personally but maybe someone
27:00 thinks that it's let's engage in fakery
27:03 until we get it right you know fake it
27:06 till you make it that whole thing mm-hmm
27:11 is that the best way to spend money is
27:15 it if we came out and said hey America
27:21 we need a bunch of you kids to get into
27:23 science I mean literally we've gotten
27:26 numbers we need a hundred thousand kids
27:30 in the United States of America we're
27:32 willing to subsidize your income but
27:33 your education but you're going to have
27:35 to prove your aptitude up to a point
27:37 okay we need aerospace aerospace and
27:42 mathematicians we need a hundred
27:44 thousand kids to study rocketry we need
27:47 fifty thousand kids to study
27:49 environmental systems you get where I'm
27:51 going right hundred thousand there two
27:53 hundred thousand there are fifty
27:53 thousand there five thousand there
27:55 whatever it is we need this many kids to
27:59 push into all these technologies boy
28:02 girl whatever right so that when we need
28:06 to form this Space Agency to conquer the
28:09 problem that is space travel to insulate
28:12 the human species against being extinct
28:15 by some rock from space right maybe
28:20 maybe it's more fundamental than that
28:22 maybe it's we need to figure out what
28:24 space is if space exists maybe we need
28:27 to figure out what these stars are that
28:28 when we film them with zoom cameras they
28:31 look like phosphorus light bulbs right
28:34 need to figure out all of this stuff
28:36 first but since it takes you know 10 to
28:41 20 years to incubate up a whole
28:42 generation of kids now again if we
28:44 started today 2018 I think in five years
28:50 we could we could grab a bunch of kids
28:53 who are in high school right now which
28:56 is America's last three years of your
28:57 schooling before you go to college I
29:00 don't know what other countries call it
29:02 maybe you guys can
29:03 chime in and let me know what your
29:04 country calls it if it's different be
29:06 kind of a neat little trivia piece but
29:08 think about it you got a sophomore
29:10 junior or senior and they're showing
29:12 major aptitude in mathematics but you
29:15 know here they are looking at their
29:16 amazing math capabilities and all
29:18 they're thinking about us Jesus do I go
29:20 get a PhD in math and a particular
29:22 discipline such that I can go and teach
29:24 it for the rest of my life and we come
29:27 in and we say no we're gonna give you
29:30 physical world models that you can use
29:34 this those that are chemists can come in
29:37 and what's awesome about chemistry is
29:40 that it either works or it doesn't work
29:43 so the science has to be correct that's
29:45 the cool thing about chemistry and so
29:48 hey we need chemists to come in and work
29:50 on new forms of metallurgy we've got to
29:54 work on chemists to make better rocket
29:57 fuel better food supplies you know that
30:00 that pace that's in the matrix well
30:02 let's make it taste like whatever these
30:03 folks who want to make it taste like
30:04 let's give it some consistency it just
30:07 has to be nutritious and pleasant on the
30:10 palate so these people don't feel like
30:12 they're eating dirt the whole time that
30:13 they're out in space we need doctors the
30:17 study the issue of losing bone density
30:19 if you don't have gravity we need a
30:21 whole group of people to study
30:23 electromagnetism to the degree that we
30:26 can manipulate the fields of the
30:28 universe to manipulate force right now
30:32 someone posted I was Dave he posted a
30:36 brilliant photograph of a diver diving
30:41 into some cave that was just the
30:43 reference material they use but then
30:45 they put forth that when a diver you
30:51 know dives in water and I've talked
30:52 about this there's a certain amount of
30:56 pressure on top of a diver and I think
30:59 it was I forgot what the thing was I
31:02 think it was like every foot equalled
31:03 14.5 pounds of pressure on top of your
31:06 head and I used to have a boss that was
31:09 a big diver and I asked him I said you
31:12 know what is the point of no return for
31:14 most divers without this
31:16 that equipment to get back up right fins
31:18 or water or air tanks or something like
31:21 that water tanks could you imagine and
31:24 he said I think it was about 38 feet or
31:25 so starts to get to that lethal point or
31:27 you better have some assistance better
31:29 have a wire coming down from the ship
31:31 you better have something because the
31:33 water above you will start pushing you
31:34 down faster and faster and faster and an
31:37 exponential curve and of course the
31:39 water down there is going to start
31:40 adding pressure on all sides and it will
31:44 crush you right but the the
31:48 clarification was is that where's
31:50 gravity in the midst of all this water
31:53 now I think that you know it's probably
31:57 a it's a misnomer to take gravity and
32:01 subtract it out of water and say where's
32:03 gravity in relation to this local
32:06 ecosystem of force which is water right
32:09 again I think that the materials that
32:10 make gravity are one extremely weak
32:13 right you have to have an earth-sized
32:17 object to create the force that we have
32:19 right so I'm probably about a buck 70
32:22 sitting in this chair okay so it took an
32:27 object the size of the world to block
32:29 all the ether from the other side coming
32:31 in and hit me in the butt and pushing me
32:33 up and then all the ether coming in and
32:36 bouncing off the the core of the earth
32:38 to give me this this weight that I have
32:41 now when you put me inside of a
32:43 localized system which is water well
32:46 it's probably automatically more
32:49 dominant than any force that is coming
32:52 in from the pure sense of ether which is
32:54 where I am now because I'm not in a pool
32:56 of water right so I think you can
32:59 outclass and outmaneuver the weak force
33:03 of gravity as might be created by ether
33:05 within this subsystem of water right but
33:09 these are things that we need to study
33:13 again if we don't have the if we're
33:15 stuck on fakery and we think we have a
33:17 bunch of things finished and fixed then
33:21 we're not going to be studying what we
33:24 need to study
33:25 I have attempted to follow NASA's
33:31 various projects right you know there's
33:35 a bunch of web browsers that know what I
33:37 like to read and it throws they throw me
33:40 a bunch of articles there's a bunch of
33:43 places that I follow that I think would
33:45 tell me if some project is Greenland you
33:48 go to nasa.gov and watch what they're
33:50 saying but what are they doing for 99.9%
33:54 of all the projects at NASA JPL they are
33:57 pushing forward and continuing the
33:59 projects that we already know about
34:01 aren't they the Rovers on Mars the this
34:05 this new initiative to conquer the moon
34:11 you know again the amount of times that
34:14 we've been told that we're gonna conquer
34:15 the moon and we never even go it's
34:18 unbelievable didn't Elan musk say that
34:22 by 2018 he was gonna put a man on the
34:27 moon this was like four years ago
34:29 but that's not even in the discussions
34:32 anymore in fact his company is so upside
34:35 down with the SEC and he's got kicked
34:37 out he got kicked out of being the
34:38 chairman of the board or whatever that
34:40 now we're like well obviously it's not
34:44 happening but it's only not happening
34:46 because he's been in trouble with saying
34:52 that it might be privatized again right
34:56 of the Goodyear blimps flying over right
34:58 now pretty funny but how is it that we
35:02 have now had space movie after space
35:07 movie and I mean really if you go back
35:10 to G's you know you guys are gonna be
35:14 better than me because there's been
35:15 books written by HG Wells by other
35:18 authors that are unknown in the 1800s
35:20 and even before that where they talk
35:22 about spacecraft that's going to travel
35:24 into space and when they show the
35:26 occupants of these crafts they show them
35:27 standing on the floor not floating
35:30 around not strapped down because there's
35:32 weightlessness okay
35:34 so you might write off all the books
35:36 that are over 150 years old
35:38 because he simply didn't know about
35:39 weightlessness Larry okay well last
35:42 seventy years we have absolutely known
35:45 that in space you're going to have a
35:48 gravity problem so why is it that nASA
35:52 has never greenlit in my lifetime and a
35:56 artificial gravity initiative to figure
36:00 out how to do it right we know that
36:05 we're strung out on petroleum you know
36:08 even though a lot of us think that the
36:11 the peak oil is a bunch of crap that oil
36:13 is a byproduct of the earth and all that
36:16 stuff we're not saying and in the next
36:18 breath oil should be continued as the
36:22 primary source of fuel in this world for
36:25 cars for jets anything that's using an
36:27 octane fuel well I don't think that I
36:30 think there should be a zero point
36:32 energy system energy should be free if
36:38 the universe is providing it for free
36:39 why can't I get it for free
36:41 obviously there's population expansion
36:44 issues with the availability of energy
36:47 that has been utterly proven as soon as
36:50 oil became available in the 1820s or so
36:53 1830s when the Rockefellers say pay
36:56 sewers slash Rothschild industry as
37:01 energy became available so did the
37:03 population expand so we got to be a
37:05 little careful you know one-to-one
37:07 correlations are one I think easier to
37:12 address you know here comes the blip
37:16 right at my face this is really trippy
37:18 the Goodyear blimp it's gonna drift I
37:23 think a little bit to my left so it
37:25 won't be exactly over my house but it's
37:27 right there it's making this sort of
37:29 plane noise that's a quick visit to the
37:33 coast but why is it that when we say
37:38 life imitates art right that's the
37:41 cornerstone of fakery and loving fakery
37:43 well I'm gonna suggest that we are
37:45 several generations behind the
37:47 generation is every 10 to 25 years let's
37:50 say
37:51 in America it's usually ten years
37:54 because everything has to renew just has
37:56 two marketing departments tell us so why
37:59 haven't we gone after these initiatives
38:02 that's a good year blue
38:05 it's a big one to two different size
38:10 blimps one's a really teeny one and
38:12 one's a pretty long one that's the big
38:14 one now someone might say okay
38:16 zero-point energy system we understand
38:18 why they don't go after that one because
38:20 that'll shut down all the power
38:21 companies electrical goes away gas goes
38:25 away oil goes away
38:27 nuclear fission plants go away that's
38:31 four gigantic industries that just
38:32 disappear off the face of the planet
38:34 right all right but what would a
38:39 artificial gravity system displace I
38:45 don't think it would displace much and
38:48 again we might be talking about a
38:49 technology that requires at least its
38:52 inception a ridiculous amount of power
38:56 to displace gravity waves such that you
39:00 can be pulled down to something right
39:03 hold in a particular direction because
39:05 of the void that it creates the negative
39:08 pressure it might create again if you
39:12 obstruct ether particles in my model you
39:15 were going to create gravity on the
39:17 other side of that object
39:18 in fact on all sides that object excuse
39:21 me because you're going to all of a
39:23 sudden not have an equal force pushing
39:26 from that area you've got a barrier so
39:28 as long as you can create a barrier
39:29 where no electrons are sorry no II throw
39:32 particles can come up from the floor and
39:35 Jack you up into the air you're going to
39:38 be pulled down to it right now there are
39:43 innovations in propulsion systems even
39:46 the Pentagon has sort of said okay well
39:48 are really high reconnaissance project
39:51 awara aircraft they use turbines to get
39:56 up there and then once they get up there
39:58 they start cruising with some
39:59 electromagnetic properties up there well
40:03 cool
40:04 why we're not using that in standard
40:08 aviation maybe it's because it's too
40:11 costly maybe you have to be up at 80,000
40:15 feet and the radiation up there is crazy
40:16 and the dangers crazy up there and so we
40:19 don't want to we don't have the
40:20 technology refined enough to actually
40:22 pull that off there's a great video out
40:25 there that someone did and it's it's not
40:29 new anymore but they the interview ISS
40:33 astronauts about the the dangers and the
40:37 process of doing spacewalks and it's
40:39 that brunette woman who's very famous on
40:42 the space station I always forget her
40:43 name and she is just kind of taking us
40:46 through a tour of the ISS that she shows
40:48 us to use two space suits and she says
40:51 you know sometimes things go bad and we
40:53 got to get outside and fix things and
40:55 here's the two two systems you know two
40:58 suits that we use and she kind of
41:00 uncovers it and shows it to you and it's
41:01 kind of this goofy hey if we got to do a
41:04 spacewalk it's no issue and then they
41:07 show you a modern u2 sr-71 pilot
41:12 prepping to fly and I don't know what
41:16 was it eighty to a hundred thousand feet
41:18 and this guy is sitting inside of a room
41:23 really serious and he is getting into a
41:26 pressurized spacesuit and he's got a
41:28 little briefcase off to the side and
41:30 he's got tubes coming in to pressurize
41:31 his suit but you can see it on his face
41:34 this dude is like I might die this is
41:39 what I do I'm gonna get up in this plane
41:41 there's any anomalies up there I could
41:44 die
41:44 and so they interviewed another pilot
41:48 sitting in the cockpit of one of these
41:49 planes and they said you know what are
41:52 the issues and he goes well he could
41:54 never get comfortable in one of these
41:56 planes meaning relax yourself and think
41:59 that things are going to be automated
42:00 and you're going to be okay why because
42:02 the atmosphere changes and they could be
42:04 in dire straits in a split second so
42:09 again we have issues that we overlook
42:13 constantly
42:15 that I think that you know I get a lot
42:19 of good comments on the Mars mission
42:21 episode which is just butchered for
42:23 facts right you must see it in YouTube
42:25 turn annotations on to have the
42:28 corrections that you need to read on
42:30 there so I apologize for that
42:32 again I wished YouTube allowed me to
42:33 swap out a video and backdate it so I
42:36 could it could erase all the comments
42:38 and stuff so we don't have people
42:39 commenting on the wrong video but
42:42 unfortunately they can't do that
42:43 but think about the variable thickness
42:46 of the atmosphere I mean one particular
42:48 day here's a rocket taking off in low
42:51 atmosphere so you're talking about very
42:53 dense atmosphere I'm assuming that
42:58 there's this brute force formula that's
42:59 like regardless of the thickness of the
43:01 atmosphere we are controlling nearly a
43:04 hundred percent where this rocket is
43:06 going and then you're going to run into
43:11 according to NASA the upper atmospheres
43:13 which have very low density of particles
43:16 however very hot particles and of course
43:19 those that study the was it the third
43:23 rule of thermodynamics is that what it
43:27 is where hot things attract to cold
43:31 things essentially would be the past
43:34 path of least resistance you need to
43:36 understand that think about a crowd
43:37 filing out of a stadium right you have
43:42 an excited bunch of people inside all
43:45 jittery and shaking and trying to get
43:48 the hell out of a place right someone
43:49 yells fire in the theater well outside
43:52 there's a bunch of space like empty
43:55 space for them to file into and so they
43:58 easily pop out into the parking lot pop
44:01 out into the front of the theater
44:03 because there's room it's path of least
44:06 resistance right well that's exactly
44:07 what's going on there so when you have a
44:11 piece of metal that's very cold maybe
44:13 zero Kelvin and you've got a bunch of
44:16 particles that are supposedly 4800
44:18 degrees Celsius they're going to attract
44:21 you and they're going to boil you
44:22 especially the faster you're going you
44:25 know it's been all those scientific
44:27 experiments about weather
44:28 if you ran through water sorry I ran
44:31 through a rainstorm
44:33 do you actually stay drier than if you
44:35 walked slowly and the science comes back
44:41 you typically do stay a little drier if
44:43 you run but you have to have the car
44:45 door open before you get there to really
44:48 make it worth your while because it's
44:51 once you stop at your car door and you
44:53 start getting pummeled you lose the
44:55 average of staying dry sure if you walk
45:00 really really slow to your car you're
45:01 gonna be more drenched than if you ran
45:03 into your car it's a common thing we all
45:04 know but you have these Rockets supposed
45:08 to go in these amazing speeds but
45:10 imagine trying to get to Mars you're in
45:13 low orbit and then you try to do this
45:16 slingshot thing which I don't think
45:18 makes any sense at all
45:19 but your scientists think doesn't make
45:21 any sense at all and you're headed
45:23 towards this red dot in space what we're
45:27 willing to suspend our logical minds
45:31 because we want it to reach Mars again
45:34 if you were off a fraction of a degree
45:36 there would have to be a correction in
45:39 the vehicle to correct for that fraction
45:42 of a degree because by the time you
45:43 travel 10 million miles that's not going
45:46 to get you to Mars but just ten million
45:48 miles but you're off point zero zero
45:51 zero zero one degree you're no longer
45:53 gonna hit Mars you won't then again
45:57 let's remember that Mars is traveling at
45:59 a its unique speed which is much faster
46:02 than Earth's orbital speed and so in
46:04 order to get a orbit going around an
46:08 object you've got to be going way faster
46:09 than its natural orbit around the Sun
46:12 and I don't believe you can juice up the
46:16 velocity of the ship and I don't think
46:19 you can get in some sling shot because
46:21 you're gonna sling I mean you probably
46:24 would get a nice sling one time and then
46:26 you're gonna be hurling out in space
46:27 just like the voyager who had a fairly
46:30 decent theory that it was going to sling
46:32 off of every one of the planets this is
46:34 gonna sling sling sling but because it
46:36 has so much forward momentum to leave
46:38 the solar system it's not going to go
46:41 and
46:41 orbit right but why don't they take us
46:46 through the mathematics of this why
46:47 don't they take us through the actual
46:48 meticulous science of this a maybe
46:51 ninety-eight percent of the world can't
46:53 understand any of it
46:54 but there's two percent they can and two
46:57 percent of seven point eight billion
46:59 people is a ton of people right that's
47:03 millions of people that could understand
47:04 the basic science of how they get to
47:07 these foreign bodies in space well NASA
47:09 is always creating little videos JPL
47:11 creates little videos and they give us
47:13 this dumb down broad-stroke
47:19 interpretation of the science it's like
47:22 that that statement of and then magic
47:24 happens sort of thing right okay so
47:28 let's reverse this scenario here before
47:30 we close we get our way we get our way a
47:35 hundred percent Donald Trump and the
47:39 generals of the military in creating
47:40 space force finally decide that the
47:43 liability of continuing to perpetuate
47:46 the fiction of NASA the fiction of jpo
47:49 is going to just simply perpetuate to a
47:52 problem that's going to be so immense
47:54 that it might threaten the national
47:55 security and the sovereignty of our
47:57 country of America we will look like the
47:59 biggest liars on planet earth and
48:01 someone makes the logical decision at
48:03 some point we're not going to continue
48:06 this anymore
48:08 so we bite the bullet press release
48:11 around the world shocking shocking press
48:15 release we've never been to the moon
48:16 we've only been in the war but help
48:19 maybe we have metal orbit maybe
48:20 everything has been a huge lie the ISS
48:22 studio gets rated by truthers or
48:25 military and they show the blue screens
48:28 and the blue grid screens for augmented
48:30 reality stuff it's all exposed it sort
48:35 of makes the hairs on the back here next
48:37 and I've done it okay now what I said
48:43 earlier starts to occur there is a world
48:47 announcement that the United States of
48:51 America is going to double down and
48:53 triple down on space travel
48:55 on all the technology necessary they do
48:59 recruit hundreds of thousands if not
49:02 millions of students in the United
49:04 States of America supercharging the
49:07 educational system books that have never
49:10 been released to colleges and in high
49:12 schools and junior High's are finally
49:15 released hell grade schools get them
49:18 kids are starting to learn the
49:20 cutting-edge technology that we
49:22 understand about the universe everything
49:25 is vetted in a laboratory so that we can
49:27 say this works this doesn't work right
49:31 people like Neil deGrasse Tyson and Bill
49:35 Nye the douchebag
49:36 television host guy they don't have a
49:39 job anymore
49:40 I think the grass Tyson could resurrect
49:43 his career if he simply said I was
49:45 deceived and now I'm on board to help
49:47 yeah I think that would work but there's
49:50 a lot of those guys that you don't know
49:52 their names
49:52 professors what have you they all
49:54 apologize they blame the institution for
49:59 deceiving them blah blah blah so
50:01 everything's fixed now the man behind
50:07 the curtain is fully exposed what you
50:10 thought was magic and what you took
50:11 pride in your entire life is now it's
50:15 kind of a raced but the silver lining is
50:19 that we want to go now we want to go and
50:26 we're pretty we're pretty confident our
50:29 own capabilities of going but now we go
50:35 from you know me thinking that man
50:39 landed on the moon a couple of months
50:43 before I was born but that way to not
50:46 going at all and now if I live to be a
50:50 hundred years old to be another 50 years
50:54 and some change
50:57 maybe I see someone step on the moon how
51:01 maybe it's a girl steps on the moon
51:02 first
51:03 how about that one huh there's secret
51:05 tech area 51 you know I'm not convinced
51:12 that we've decided a UFO not sure but
51:18 let's say there's a bunch of tech that
51:20 again like I said in replacing NASA
51:22 episode just before Trump announced a
51:27 space for us which I still think is just
51:29 wild serendipity there is black box
51:33 technology like I suggested in an
51:34 episode if the military had technology
51:37 that if released to the world I was as
51:40 to how it's done and our enemies got
51:43 ahold of it you know hopefully don't
51:45 have any enemies but if we really did
51:46 they could you know use that technology
51:49 to attack us to destroy us to destroy
51:52 other people in the world we don't want
51:54 to be responsible for that so again
51:56 let's just say the scientists come up
51:58 with one part of the equation they're
52:00 like well we have electromagnet
52:02 magnetism technology that creates
52:04 gravity artificial gravity but we don't
52:10 have a propulsion system that can lift
52:11 us into space we don't have a system
52:13 that can protect us against the Van
52:15 Allen belts if they exist or ambient
52:17 radiation from the Sun let alone a
52:19 coronal mass ejection from the Sun we
52:22 don't know enough about the moon surface
52:24 to step on it yet so we got to put some
52:27 Rovers up there we don't have the
52:29 technology yet what would our mean Mike
52:35 my question to you is this especially if
52:38 you're a truther would it be elation
52:41 that these agencies get destroyed maybe
52:47 yes what our elation continued if the
52:51 sort of the bad news that we don't have
52:54 a thimbles a thimble of technology to
52:58 get these things accomplished discovered
53:00 yet that we are so far behind the curve
53:02 that it might be a thousand years before
53:08 man steps on the moon I think it would
53:10 be a very interesting thing too
53:15 go to bed at night frustrated with the
53:18 Space Agency's a bit lying and then
53:21 let's say seven days occurs and for
53:26 whatever reason you're in the pocket to
53:29 participate in this new these new
53:33 programs you're young
53:35 you're really smart or nothing else
53:39 you're just gonna be a really good
53:40 observer and whatever you have a really
53:42 good bird's eye maybe your kids super
53:43 smart so gonna watch this from your
53:45 kid's perspective where you work for the
53:47 agency and you're gonna be you know in
53:49 the conference rooms as we start to look
53:50 at this and the very next time you go to
53:52 bed I'm give it 7 days giving you 7 days
53:57 to really contemplate what's going on
54:00 you realize that in your lifetime it's
54:05 you're never gonna see these
54:06 accomplishments happen now I think most
54:09 of us have no problem with that at all
54:11 we're gonna sleep ok is it a bummer yeah
54:15 sure but you know there's a ton of myths
54:20 we're told as children what happens when
54:22 your tooth falls out what happens at the
54:26 winter solstice once a year magical men
54:30 that help us go to sleep with sand they
54:32 have in some little pouch someone asked
54:36 a brilliant question on YouTube and they
54:41 said you know I think about aliens
54:45 coming to our planet or at least
54:48 existing in the universe and it's the
54:51 this person did a brilliant job of just
54:55 saying you know you've all heard the
54:56 theory that we try to calculate how how
55:02 much more advanced a particular culture
55:06 could be in the universe essentially
55:09 counting for you to if you take the Big
55:11 Bang which is obviously a bunch [ __ ]
55:13 but at some point an alien life force
55:18 becomes sentient starts developing
55:21 technology and then they might be a
55:24 million years ahead of us and for some
55:27 crazy reason
55:28 they didn't hate each other maybe they
55:31 didn't have any different biological
55:32 races I said they didn't have blacks
55:36 against whites or whatever there's no
55:37 history of this stupid racism that has
55:40 caused so many wars and for whatever
55:44 reason me but they're playing it smaller
55:46 and so when one person gained technology
55:49 the all guy they gained the technology
55:51 worked together not necessarily a Borg
55:53 hivemind
55:54 thing but maybe they even that's the
55:56 case right but then he said now I think
56:01 about the fact that maybe they had an
56:03 open mind the entire time they didn't
56:06 you know put people in house prison for
56:09 discovering something they didn't
56:12 worship false geniuses that stole
56:16 everything from other people and then
56:19 published it right they forbid two other
56:21 people from patenting it and they stole
56:22 it then they wrote papers on it then
56:25 they're considered a genius hmm
56:27 hopefully you're able to figure out who
56:31 I'm talking about here and they're
56:32 people like Tesla were celebrated said
56:36 of erasing the theory of ether they kept
56:38 it and they nurtured it and they moved
56:40 it forward and they discovered things
56:42 how to do things that no one else has
56:45 discovered in the universe and the big
56:49 one that you're gonna hear me harp on a
56:51 little bit I think in season four and I
56:53 do apologize for those people I offend
56:56 by saying this I think it was a female
57:00 that was saying this but I apologize if
57:03 I had that wrong but they said what if
57:07 they didn't have religion a fictitious
57:10 story about an imaginary person who
57:15 never existed coming down and giving
57:19 again authority to man right this whole
57:22 idea that God came down on this planet
57:25 in the form of a man and then gave away
57:27 the key to another man who then ran the
57:30 biggest multi millennial or millennium
57:35 empire of child pedophilia child
57:39 sacrifice all these horrible things
57:40 right
57:41 they didn't have that they kept moving
57:45 forward and progressing and progressing
57:47 and progressing they don't need a
57:50 million years do they hey what if we
57:53 dial back to zero ad but we subtract out
57:58 of our history all of our racism all of
58:03 our religion you might have a religion
58:06 of how to behave as human beings here
58:07 read the book of how to be good it's
58:09 called the good book how to be good
58:11 that's all it is yeah it's got some
58:13 allegory and stories that we use to
58:15 teach young children you can't
58:17 understand it otherwise and then as you
58:20 get older there's a version of the good
58:21 book that is just simply saying alright
58:24 adult you know you don't even mess with
58:26 you that's why you don't mess with
58:28 anyone else it's common law you get it
58:30 okay good and you accept it right oh
58:33 yeah yeah of course no one's hurting me
58:35 so why should I start doing that for
58:37 someone else the level of mental illness
58:39 goes away because it never exists
58:42 because we don't have parents abusing
58:44 children we don't ostracize people for
58:47 being different and so they never turned
58:50 into sociopaths and Psychopaths and so
58:53 they remain productive parts of society
58:56 we don't have any gender problems right
58:59 males and females can attract each other
59:03 find each other
59:04 procreate fall in love have children
59:06 protect other people's children from
59:08 mishaps not from predators because those
59:11 people don't exist right
59:12 but you know your kids playing in the
59:14 street you run out to get your ass out
59:16 of street you're gonna hit by a car and
59:18 here's why you're gonna get hit by a car
59:19 and you gotta look both ways left right
59:21 left you know you feel me right this
59:27 person was suggesting just a basic level
59:30 of intelligence that I think we have
59:32 access to today what if that could go
59:35 back and rewrite the history of mankind
59:37 and get rid of all this confrontation
59:42 how many times have you had a goal in
59:44 life and it was blocked by confrontation
59:48 that has nothing to do with the goal you
59:50 were gonna start a business but then
59:52 your wife lets you know that she's going
59:54 to divorce you
59:55 husband's gonna divorce you well they
59:57 don't want to divorce you but they're
59:58 gonna start cheating on you they're
60:00 gonna spend all your money on some
60:01 ridiculous thing that isn't part of your
60:03 mutual goal system within the family so
60:06 you're sidetracked you can't get your
60:08 goal you're you could technically but
60:11 your mind can't think straight because
60:12 you're thinking about this over here it
60:16 happens to all of us all the time
60:18 little levels on big levels if you find
60:21 yourself in a multi-year situation where
60:23 you don't have any distractions and
60:24 you're able to go for your goals you're
60:26 very fortunate human being take
60:28 advantage of it enjoy it help us get to
60:30 the moon I thought that was brilliant
60:33 you know inside the NASA fakery paradigm
60:38 I think it is facilitated by several
60:43 other fakery paradigms that came way
60:45 before that I have an episode in season
60:48 one probably in the first 20 episodes
60:51 about your belief systems and how it's
60:54 very important that you police your
60:56 belief systems I believe that we are
61:01 raised on well I know that we're raised
61:04 in America on tons of fictional
61:07 characters that make being a young
61:09 person just magical Christmastime
61:12 there's a magical character you lose a
61:14 tooth magical character there's Easter
61:17 and there's a magical character and
61:20 what's interesting is we invent bunny
61:21 rabbits when it's actually sort of a
61:25 it's a Catholic you know ritual kids
61:30 don't want to hear the SuperDuper
61:31 religious version they want to eat the
61:33 chocolate ears off of a bunny but it's
61:37 fiction fiction fiction until you grow
61:39 up to be an adult and you're supposed to
61:40 relinquish all of the fiction except for
61:44 one and that's the religion of the
61:47 United States of America and you know
61:50 what it is if you've been riding on the
61:53 training wheels in your mind to accept
61:55 fakery
61:56 and so you are primed to continue fakery
62:01 in a bunch of other paradigms right and
62:05 it goes up to the point of political
62:07 affiliation
62:09 the fakery of the right and the left the
62:13 fakery that you're being represented by
62:15 politicians that care about you now
62:18 maybe we have a change in America right
62:20 now where that's changing France as of
62:23 December 2018 is certainly trying to get
62:25 back to real representation real control
62:30 over their lives because they're not
62:33 stupid they can see what could be and
62:37 they're fighting for it and you know I
62:41 usually don't get into that kind of
62:43 thing but you know it's not about a gas
62:45 tax it's about freedom from austerity
62:47 can we get rid of the fakery of space
62:51 programs and not get rid of the fakery
62:53 of everything else in our lives
62:54 I don't know part of me thinks we can't
63:00 think we have to get rid of all of it
63:02 and have the courage to do so if one
63:06 gets angry at the notion that some of
63:10 these things are being called fake but
63:12 you believed your entire life that they
63:14 are real mm-hmm that's a tough one isn't
63:18 it
63:18 you got to reevaluate well is it real
63:22 real I mean is it really real you know
63:24 just because a bunch of people believe
63:27 something doesn't make it real the
63:30 majority at least 51% of the world
63:32 believe we went to the moon at least in
63:35 America they do does that make it true
63:40 mm-hmm does that overwhelming blind
63:44 obedience hurt mankind
63:46 I don't know again do you fake it till
63:50 you make it
63:51 and if you don't fake it you never make
63:53 it I don't believe that did Farraday
63:58 Volta Rome Tesla did they fake
64:04 electricity was discovered and that it
64:07 was mastered before they built machines
64:09 that proved it nope did Edison fake
64:15 making a light bulb work in order to get
64:18 one to work nope
64:21 you know we did science like chemistry
64:24 and biochemistry do those groups fake it
64:27 until they made it no they did it they
64:32 figured it out they did the hard work
64:34 and they figured it out which is why
64:36 that those areas of science are most
64:39 likely 100% true by design they can't be
64:44 anything other than true because it
64:46 wouldn't work when does you look at a
64:49 periodic table right and you say when is
64:51 something turn into a liquid a solid
64:53 turning to liquid meaning its melting
64:54 point well if you lie about that how far
64:58 you gonna get in metallurgy
65:00 could you make a bar of gold if you
65:02 didn't know when the stuff melts nope
65:06 well we got it at 10 degrees I think
65:10 it's gonna you know I'm gonna fake that
65:12 it melts at 10 degrees until it melts at
65:14 10 degrees you're gonna die before it
65:16 happens you feel me right we have a lot
65:20 of growing up to do as a society don't
65:21 we now I should put a footnote in before
65:25 I close off here if I tell you that a
65:28 religion isn't true a lot of people take
65:30 that the wrong way and they say well I
65:32 know God exists
65:34 hey I'm not denying any of that
65:37 whatsoever
65:38 one does not equal the other by any
65:41 stretch of the imagination I'm pretty
65:44 sure the moon exists and just because
65:46 man hasn't made it to the moon and I
65:48 tell you that that story of us making it
65:50 to the moon isn't true doesn't make the
65:53 moon not exist and it doesn't negate
65:56 man's ability to figure out how to get
65:58 there
65:58 now maybe all of our plans about being
66:01 on the moon are horribly crushed when we
66:05 find out that it's it's a soft surface
66:09 that you can't even stand on you know
66:12 maybe all the minerals that they say are
66:14 on the moon aren't really there and so
66:16 all these ideas of mining you know
66:19 particular resources off the surface of
66:21 the Moon they all flub because those
66:23 minerals aren't there okay maybe there's
66:25 some other stuff that's there that's
66:27 interesting it's a hell of a thing being
66:29 a grown-up isn't it it's a hell of a
66:32 thing
66:33 but it's also powerful to realize that
66:35 well you can engage reality at whatever
66:38 level you want to engage it right I
66:42 would say that if you look at all the
66:44 fakery that we have accepted as human
66:46 beings and 2018 you're looking at a
66:50 giant redwood tree I hate this analogy
66:52 I'm one thoughtful because I love
66:53 redwood trees but we're gonna go for
66:55 this this analogy anyway in order to
66:59 become completely lucid in this analogy
67:02 you're gonna have to chop that tree down
67:04 you can't set it on fire because there's
67:07 nothing's gonna do it for you you're
67:08 gonna have to do it for yourself you
67:09 have to earn every single timber moment
67:13 on that tree and let's say it's just
67:17 thick as a house this is kind that you
67:19 can drill a hole and drive a semi
67:20 through it right but all you have to
67:25 knock it down
67:26 is it as a hatchet and a sharpening rock
67:30 right and so you know that all you can
67:34 do is get up every single day and just
67:35 make a chop chop little v chop boom boom
67:38 boom boom boom boom and you're gonna be
67:40 chopping for years you could even take a
67:44 break for a year or two or ten years and
67:47 come back to it and chop a little bit
67:49 more chop a little bit more but once it
67:50 falls and the paradigm in your mind it
67:54 is the summation of all of your fakery
67:58 of all the deceit that you've allowed to
68:00 infect your mind and it might hurt your
68:03 heart a little bit
68:04 damn I really wish that some of these
68:08 things were real is it better that the
68:10 world is flat or round you know don't
68:13 know I think it is very powerful for a
68:18 man to have a frontier that is unknown
68:23 it has always driven us in the past and
68:25 I think that by being told certain
68:28 things in science especially pop science
68:30 that these frontiers don't exist anymore
68:32 because someone did an equation and
68:35 theoretical physics and they say this
68:39 can't really prove it but man is it a
68:42 convincing that algorithm on the
68:43 blackboard is so massive that when it
68:46 says equals in
68:47 squared at the bottom and someone says
68:49 well what does that really mean and they
68:50 say well I'll tell you one thing it
68:51 means you can't travel the speed of
68:53 light oh [ __ ] really well if the kaki if
68:58 it's round its heliocentric and the
69:00 universe is you know infinite
69:03 light-years across or whatever that
69:05 means that man will never see another
69:06 nuke and cranny of this universe besides
69:08 the one that's right in front of our
69:10 face unless we build gigantic ships and
69:13 we can get near the speed of light and
69:16 then when you travel for hundreds and
69:18 hundreds of years towards a particular
69:20 body in space and then maybe it's not
69:22 hospitable that's a bummer right but if
69:28 you chop all that down then those
69:31 limitations get reset maybe they're
69:33 still true maybe it's not that algorithm
69:36 that figures it out but maybe it's
69:37 something we figure out through some
69:39 different manner maybe it's a hundred
69:40 percent true yeah I think you feel me I
69:43 think this exercise is good for the mind
69:46 we got a lot of growing up to do don't
69:48 we don't we look back on some eras of
69:52 humanity and we go look how primitive
69:54 they were and then those of us are more
69:56 lucid we go geez look how much more
69:58 advanced we were the pyramids seriously
70:03 Machu Picchu huge we had some stuff
70:07 figured out that we lost let me know
70:12 what you think in the comments
70:13 cross reference things you guys have
70:16 made just amazing calm comments again I
70:21 get like bursts of opportunity to go
70:23 through your comments and because they
70:25 actually read them and try to follow
70:27 them you know if you give me a bunch of
70:29 no I don't get this a lot if someone
70:31 gives me like a video that's four hours
70:35 long or something I mean never see the
70:37 video because it's simply too long and
70:39 by the time I get a chance to see it I
70:40 got two others that are thirty minutes
70:42 long and I've just got a you know manage
70:45 my time but I really try to get in there
70:49 so if I push like on your video that
70:51 means I've read it really read it anyway
70:54 if you have been to deep thoughts radio
70:56 calm please go there's two different
70:58 formats there's video and audio so if
71:00 you want
71:00 when I take it into your car I
71:02 definitely grab a copy of the podcast
71:05 there's a lakh Facebook group great
71:07 group of folks the only reason why we
71:09 lock it is if we don't all the fake BOTS
71:13 come in we probably have allowed you
71:16 know BOTS to come in to watch the page
71:20 but I tell you what they don't pollute
71:22 the page which is good there's a patreon
71:28 page where those who want to donate
71:29 those who do I personally thank you know
71:33 that the patreon page has sort of the
71:36 back the backstage pass to the show and
71:39 so what that grants you is previews to
71:41 almost all the shows prior to release
71:44 the only time that I release it almost
71:48 automatically in and don't give the
71:51 patreon group a an opportunity to see it
71:54 beforehand is if I'm running late and I
71:57 do a double feature on like a Sunday and
71:59 the reason why I do double features is
72:01 that I have an episode that I think that
72:03 will appeal to more of the hardcore
72:06 listeners and then I have an episode
72:08 that I think will appeal to the the
72:11 newcomers you know so this is an episode
72:13 aimed at the newcomers it is definitely
72:16 near and dear to my heart I can't make
72:18 any episodes that I don't feel very
72:20 passionate about so no I'm not trying to
72:22 ever create filler in fact I think the
72:24 ones that I'm more passionate about are
72:25 being observed as filler you know like
72:27 my more cerebral stuff so anyhow take
72:31 care of yourself in someone else and
72:33 I'll see in the next deep thoughts over
72:34 now
