00:35 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:37 gentlemen as i pull down this
00:40 16 year old vintage stick here
00:44 it's got a wild night out in the
00:45 neighborhood because it's only 12 15 and
00:47 it's a saturday
00:48 and i happen to live in a place where no
00:51 one believes in the hoax
00:54 so as you can see we're going to talk
00:55 about something that i'm calling
00:58 anthropomorphizing death
01:01 because there's a lot of it and it's a
01:03 very natural process
01:05 but as we try to look at
01:10 the situation in 2020
01:14 i've discovered you know there's just
01:16 it's it may be even inadvertent
01:20 but there's a brilliance in the evil
01:22 that's going on in 2020.
01:26 imagine that you find every
01:30 sort of built-in traditional habit
01:33 whether it be instinct or cultural habit
01:36 of a particular population
01:40 and then you create a situation that
01:42 will exploit it
01:43 feed it and then you can insert whatever
01:46 you want
01:48 that's what 2020 is about it seems as if
01:52 there are some people out there that
01:54 think that they have the right to live
01:55 forever
01:57 there are people that haven't taken care
01:59 of their health one day in their life
02:00 they eat whatever they want they're
02:02 completely overweight they're diabetic
02:04 they're hypoglycemic they have bad heart
02:06 problems
02:07 all because of self-imposed issues who
02:10 are now
02:10 suddenly wearing a worthless piece of
02:12 cloth over their face
02:14 trying to walk around and
02:17 say okay well it was going to be really
02:19 hard to eat right and exercise
02:22 don't have anything to do with that
02:23 effort stuff
02:25 go see my episode on effort shaming
02:27 you'll love it
02:29 so i'm gonna do is i'm gonna walk around
02:31 grocery stores and malls with this again
02:34 foe thing on my face and i am going to
02:39 police the very thing that i've never
02:41 done in my lifetime which is take care
02:43 of my health
02:47 see how beautifully but that extends the
02:50 psychosis
02:51 and narcissistic laziness of these
02:55 individuals
02:56 such that it's like oh my god you're
02:58 gonna get a karen on one side you're
03:00 gonna get a karen on the other side
03:01 take it off put it on when everyone
03:05 should shut the hell up
03:06 and if you're afraid to catch something
03:08 and die stay inside
03:11 just stay inside the deaths for 2020
03:14 will
03:14 probably be about 20 to 30 000 less than
03:18 2019 cause of death well
03:21 all the other ones are flat lined and
03:23 this one is going through the roof
03:26 but a very interesting thing happened
03:30 on my facebook feed
03:33 i've kind of switched over to the
03:34 facebook account where you guys see me
03:36 at the d thoughts radio page so that i
03:38 can be with you guys more
03:41 and i've forgotten that this dude
03:44 from my high school from my kindergarten
03:47 all the way to high school
03:49 had friended me on that account and he
03:50 wasn't a really big poster so i didn't
03:52 really notice it
03:54 but his brother just passed away
03:58 sad thing sad thing his brother passed
04:00 away
04:02 but then i read in the comments or i
04:05 read it sorry in his post he's posted a
04:07 picture of his brother
04:10 god bless him god bless his pain you
04:12 know i don't want him to feel pain i
04:14 don't want his brother to be gone
04:16 i mean he's younger than me by quite a
04:18 quite a few years
04:20 at least five or so somewhere in there
04:25 but he says if you don't think the cg
04:30 graphic of a virus is real
04:33 think again trying to let us all know
04:36 that he thinks his brother died of this
04:37 thing this year
04:40 all right and you know of course these
04:43 feelings i'm having about this
04:44 particular situation have been growing
04:47 i didn't reply at all to it gave him a
04:49 little huggy
04:50 face you know emoji
04:53 he's probably incorrect with the
04:56 diagnosis but
04:56 here's the thing
05:00 i went to seven different schools as i
05:01 always say a lot of people have been to
05:03 more
05:04 but seven schools and twelve grades
05:06 that's pretty good
05:08 i remember him and his brother at least
05:11 by first grade
05:13 because i only lived in his area for
05:17 about about a year and a half's worth of
05:19 grades
05:20 and then we moved out into the country
05:23 same town different school
05:25 he and his brother were morbidly obese
05:29 from the age of five and up he is still
05:33 morbidly obese and when i say morbidly
05:35 obese we're talking about
05:38 at least 100 pounds overweight the
05:40 picture he posted of his brother
05:43 these are short guys he's at least 100
05:47 pounds overweight
05:50 they've always been and i'm willing to
05:52 bet they're damn near
05:53 150 200 pounds overweight at times in
05:55 their life
05:57 last time i saw this guy
06:00 he was binge drinking during one of our
06:02 reunions because he does live in the
06:03 town that i come from
06:04 still he was absolutely hammered
06:08 accusing everyone in the room of being
06:10 racist
06:11 in fact he accused one of the most
06:14 experienced
06:15 teachers who lives in a very urban area
06:18 who couldn't possibly be that way
06:20 otherwise he wouldn't be talented at
06:21 what he does
06:24 by being racist to him at the bar
06:27 i i actually told a story about this
06:29 some four years ago about me settling
06:31 this sort of dispute but he was the
06:32 other guy
06:34 pulling his sjw card out
06:38 long before it was trendy his body and
06:41 his life
06:42 are an indicator of his laziness his
06:45 accusation in the room of racism was a
06:47 lazy way to deal with his drinking
06:49 problem
06:50 the guy was hammered and now
06:53 he is anthropomorphizing the current
06:56 situation in 2020
06:58 as the reason why his morbidly obese
07:00 family
07:01 has sudden deaths
07:05 i got another friend of mine i love
07:06 dearly here in town
07:08 he doesn't live specifically in my town
07:12 he was at least 200 pounds overweight he
07:15 ate such bad food
07:18 that he blew out his liver he started
07:20 having catastrophic organ failure
07:22 strictly because of eating
07:25 horrible food he doesn't do drugs he
07:27 doesn't drink
07:29 in fact i don't think he ever has in his
07:30 life that's just one of his things
07:32 very religious man but we have burial
07:35 rituals don't we
07:38 when you play civilization way back in
07:40 the day or even today
07:42 and you're young and you're not aware of
07:45 burial
07:46 rituals and then you play a video game
07:48 where you're
07:50 bringing up a society
07:54 inside of some simulation and one of the
07:57 technologies that you can research is
07:59 burial rituals you might be like
08:01 why the hell am i doing burial which i
08:03 mean it sounds cool but why what is that
08:05 and that is that when man hits a certain
08:08 precipice of spiritual awakeness
08:11 or awakening we start to believe in a
08:14 god
08:16 when you start to believe in a paradigm
08:18 outside of yourself and outside of your
08:19 observable reality because you listen to
08:21 your
08:22 senses you start to manifest
08:27 a connection and then the connection
08:28 becomes this sort of
08:30 impression of what you believe you are
08:33 feeling from the other side
08:36 it is a bit like being in a dark room
08:38 with your hands out
08:39 and you're touching stuff and as you
08:42 touch things you have visions of what
08:44 they're made out of maybe this is this
08:46 one's
08:46 it feels like wood this one feels like
08:47 steel this feels like some soft bits on
08:51 somebody
08:52 once that occurs the stories start
08:56 flying
08:58 gods are created whether they exist or
09:02 not
09:02 we create them and then as we
09:06 create the gods we start to
09:10 assume what the gods would desire of
09:14 us and then we get a religion of some
09:17 sort
09:18 a method of living the elders of a
09:21 particular
09:22 village will look at the needs of the
09:23 village and incorporate into a religion
09:26 if it takes off
09:27 if it is revered by the people all of
09:30 the habits that they wish the people had
09:33 for instance circumcision was to
09:37 temper the spread of disease because we
09:40 didn't have
09:40 the hygiene that we have today to make
09:42 sure we stayed
09:44 clean now we're so clean as long as you
09:47 live in a first world country
09:48 you probably actually don't technically
09:50 need to do it
09:52 but just knowing the average hygiene of
09:54 a man uh
09:56 i don't know i've talked i haven't
09:58 talked to too many women they're like
09:59 yay
10:00 love that when the catholic church
10:03 cornered the fish market
10:06 in italy they started making fish a
10:10 required meal of the week
10:13 so they could sell their products
10:15 nothing to do with nutrition
10:17 definitely nothing to do with god i mean
10:20 jesus fished i guess
10:23 we are being set up
10:26 to take all of our instinctual rituals
10:28 with death
10:30 and give this this computer generated
10:33 graphic
10:35 which is your only evidence that this
10:37 thing exists
10:39 and that's you can take that to the bank
10:43 now you might have someone dying of
10:45 something
10:46 when hospitals are subsidized by the
10:49 government
10:51 to diagnosis with something well what do
10:54 you think
10:54 what do you think i'm not going to kill
10:57 most people but man if they can kill you
10:58 get 50 grand
11:00 it was really weird the audio just
11:02 stopped for some reason
11:04 but they're getting us to remove logic
11:07 out of our lives because they have this
11:09 thing going around
11:12 i think for some it's comforting because
11:15 if you lose a loved one
11:17 and you don't want to have lost a loved
11:19 one
11:20 and you look up at god and you're like
11:22 hey uh why did you take my loved one
11:25 from me by the way the sprinklers are
11:26 going next door
11:28 now they can just look at this thing and
11:31 then they get to go out and cash in
11:33 on all of the sympathy from this thing
11:36 it's just a weird thing you know before
11:38 social media before the internet
11:41 when something horrific happened like
11:45 well there's different types of deaths
11:46 of course there's ones you
11:48 saw coming ones that you didn't see
11:50 coming
11:52 there's the young dying and then the old
11:54 dying it's two different hemispheres
11:57 what's really different about this
11:58 particular year is the following
12:00 and you need to keep your spidey senses
12:03 open on this one
12:05 and apply this to lots of categories of
12:08 existence in this world some are going
12:11 to be blatantly obvious we're going to
12:12 talk about
12:14 and then we'll swing back to the subject
12:16 but i want you to see like the
12:18 the undertow of what's going on
12:22 anytime you create a crisis that lasts
12:26 this long you create psychosis
12:29 inside people meaning
12:32 habits that didn't exist before or
12:35 existed perhaps in a very minute way
12:38 start to galvanize start to solidify
12:41 start to become
12:42 something that is difficult to extract
12:44 out of your system
12:47 remember what i told you a million times
12:51 my grandmother went through the
12:52 depression and i don't think she was
12:55 ever
12:55 ever able to fix a meal hundreds of
12:58 meals right
13:00 without mentioning the depression
13:03 that's how scarred she was when i moved
13:05 to california i was buying some socks at
13:07 this
13:08 gentleman's store in west lake
13:09 california this really dapper old dude
13:12 walks up to me and he goes
13:13 because i'm looking at socks and i'm
13:14 like trying to find all these really
13:15 cool socks and
13:16 he goes hey can i give you a piece of
13:18 advice i said yeah sure
13:20 and he goes we learn something during
13:21 depression don't buy different socks
13:24 like okay why and he goes because when
13:27 one of them gets a hole in it
13:29 your other one matches with all the
13:30 other socks that you have
13:32 as soon as you get a hole in a designer
13:34 sock you gotta throw the whole thing
13:35 away
13:36 he was right i did what he said it was
13:39 great
13:41 but we don't want to lose track of
13:43 reality any more than we already have
13:46 i don't know how many dozen people have
13:48 come into the smoke shops
13:50 posted online that they have had a
13:54 friend guy a relative die and they
13:56 pointed at this thing and then you ask
13:57 them a few questions
13:58 about the person and you do find out
14:01 they have pre-existing conditions you do
14:03 find out they're
14:04 over 80 years old or they're really
14:06 obese
14:09 that's why we don't want to get
14:11 unhealthy while we're young
14:13 and why we want to be as healthy as we
14:16 can until we get old
14:18 so at least we deal with the least
14:21 amount of interruptions when we get
14:23 older but guess what when you get older
14:24 your body stops functioning your brain
14:26 stops functioning depending on how you
14:28 use it
14:29 remember you keep listening to deep
14:30 thoughts you're probably okay the whole
14:32 time
14:34 but we don't want to set into motion
14:37 things that we're going to have to deal
14:39 with for decades that are going to
14:40 interrupt your ability to be compatible
14:42 with other human beings
14:44 and it's not just your lovers and that
14:46 kind of stuff it could be your children
14:48 it could be your existing spouse
14:50 your existing relatives could be that
14:53 two years from now you're trying to do a
14:54 business deal and
14:57 someone is hanging on to the past
14:58 hanging onto these false paradigms
15:00 and you're having a hard time
15:01 communicating
15:04 because you didn't believe in it and
15:06 they did
15:08 but the people who did this have two
15:11 opinions of it i guarantee you
15:13 first and foremost the number one
15:14 opinion that they have
15:16 they don't care two they love it
15:20 they love that we'll be messed up
15:22 they'll be able to create
15:23 small businesses and large businesses to
15:26 deal with
15:27 the fallout of the ptsd of this year of
15:29 2020.
15:31 oh boy they're licking their chops man
15:35 we have an entire year of false
15:38 fraudulent diagnoses based on a test
15:41 that according to the creator
15:44 94 false positives he said if you
15:48 because they have to spin your blood to
15:49 find out what you have and there's a
15:51 certain number of spins to find a
15:52 certain
15:53 particular condition so he says if you
15:55 continue spinning that blood
15:57 you'll go positive for absolutely
15:58 everything that exists on planet earth
16:00 everything the machine can test for
16:02 you'll go positive for including
16:07 boogeyman like hiv
16:10 but because of this bad year
16:13 this fraudulent year the medical data as
16:16 i've mentioned once before
16:18 is going to get skewed we're going to be
16:22 associating things with each other for
16:24 years and unless someone's got the guts
16:26 to say okay
16:26 everything that we deduced in 2020 burn
16:29 it
16:30 burn it and get rid of it because maybe
16:33 some of it's true
16:34 but a lot of it's not we can't afford to
16:36 pollute
16:37 our medical associations and and
16:40 facilities with all this bad information
16:43 because we're then going to kill each
16:45 other with false diagnoses
16:48 giving people medicine they don't need
16:50 not giving them what they do need
16:53 but this episode is really getting at
16:55 the sort of root
16:57 of a saying that might go like this
17:01 this is something that two friends will
17:03 say to each other definitely guys say it
17:05 i don't know if girls say it
17:07 but guys will say you know i just did
17:10 what i had to do to get through it
17:13 and that's part of what
17:14 anthropomorphizing death is all about
17:17 it's a mind game it's a mind trick just
17:19 to get rid of
17:21 something that would be otherwise
17:22 impossible to deal with
17:26 and i respect that i totally respect
17:28 that
17:30 what i'm hoping is the individual that
17:32 goes through this
17:33 is able to then flush the toilet
17:36 once this ceases to be so painful
17:40 that that other false mechanism is
17:41 necessary
17:44 but i want you guys aware of the
17:48 fallout of this situation and not only
17:51 yourself
17:52 which i doubt that a lot of you unless
17:53 you're new listeners will have
17:55 too much left over in the ptsd realm
17:59 but put some thought process
18:02 process into it to detox others out of
18:05 it
18:06 imagine this the 1918
18:11 flu h1n1 influenza
18:14 totally different thing than what we
18:16 have now it went on for
18:20 almost three years you know little
18:23 little threads here and there still
18:25 going around the world
18:27 now you know as well as i do let's just
18:30 say it ended in 1921
18:33 three years later at the end of 21 we're
18:36 pretty sure we got that
18:37 mutation taken care of but now someone
18:40 dies in 22
18:42 kind of sporadically the doctors at the
18:45 time with limited medical capabilities
18:47 might say ah
18:49 maybe it is a little straggler of that
18:51 1918 thing we had
18:53 whether it's true or not and then as
18:56 that family member who has dealt with
18:59 potentially three years of bad news has
19:01 to deal with that death
19:04 maybe it was easier to deal with it by
19:06 lumping it into the other 100 million
19:08 people that passed
19:10 or maybe not maybe it was even more
19:13 frustrating god
19:14 damn it you know get out of my life get
19:16 out of here right
19:18 i think there's going to be obviously
19:22 this isn't a hugely profound observation
19:24 but i think there's going to be this
19:26 difficulty
19:28 of getting this boogeyman out of
19:30 people's minds unless there is a
19:32 full admission exploration of what
19:34 actually occurred
19:36 again one of the scenarios would be to
19:40 say that there's a
19:41 bio weapon going around that's being
19:44 manually spread by
19:45 infiltrators from this other country
19:48 it could be a lot of countries there's
19:50 doesn't have to be a specific one you
19:52 might think in your mind
19:53 but just spread it in public places and
19:55 rule places
19:57 and someone goes home and dies of the
19:59 bioweapon or really struggles through
20:01 the process
20:03 and then of course it matches 100 what
20:05 you're told this
20:06 cg image is and so you confirm it in
20:10 your brain that it's real
20:12 now it's probably not a bad idea to
20:14 confirm that someone is doing something
20:17 but now what if and this is just
20:19 completely hypothetical okay i'm not i
20:21 haven't
20:22 read anything that says this i'm just
20:24 giving you an alternative in your brain
20:26 just so you can keep again your
20:29 your cognitive abilities as sharp as
20:31 possible when looking at data but
20:34 imagine
20:35 our military our intelligence side of
20:38 things
20:39 has trapped a few text messages
20:42 voicemails
20:43 conferences zoom calls whatever and
20:46 there's blatant
20:48 evidence and admission that it is a bio
20:51 weapon being spread around and not just
20:52 some cg thing
20:54 that no one can see in a microscope i've
20:57 had some interesting debates online
20:59 very briefly i always walk away from
21:01 after a while because
21:02 talking to dom ain't worth your time
21:04 right
21:06 but what's interesting for me is that
21:09 and i'm just going to be blatantly
21:10 honest about it
21:12 i have lots of friends who went from a
21:14 previous career
21:15 into nursing now i've got some
21:18 family and some sort of friend family
21:21 where it's a different situation than
21:22 the one i'm mentioning
21:24 but your low-level nurse if you got all
21:28 the nurses in america i don't know about
21:29 your country but if you got all the
21:30 nurses in america together and said um
21:33 raise your hand if your previous job was
21:35 being a waitress
21:38 i'm thinking more than 50 percent of
21:40 when raised their hand
21:43 yet these individuals with no empirical
21:45 knowledge about virology
21:47 they don't have the vocational
21:48 capability of teaching themselves this
21:50 stuff by themselves now some are
21:52 deadly and some are amazing but they're
21:53 the ones out there championing
21:55 our view of the situation
21:58 but to sit and try to be lectured by
22:00 someone who
22:01 the second they start speaking
22:04 it's all talking points out of some
22:09 mass product but they want you afraid
22:13 they want you afraid
22:18 you talk to them about their hospitals
22:19 and they'll say things like
22:21 where capacity and i said okay so every
22:24 employee that
22:24 was working for your hospital in 2019 is
22:28 is currently going to work in 2020 oh no
22:31 we're down to 15
22:32 skeleton staff but we're overwhelmed
22:34 it's like yeah
22:36 you would be overwhelmed any time of the
22:37 year because guess what the rest of the
22:39 world's still working
22:40 people still getting fingers cut off and
22:42 getting colds and pneumonia and a bunch
22:44 of other stuff has nothing to do with
22:45 this
22:45 rumored computer virus
22:49 isn't it funny if we say that the
22:52 molecule is a cg image and then
22:54 therefore it's a computer image and then
22:56 we kind of are afraid of a computer
22:57 virus in one
22:59 symbolic way this is why i don't have a
23:02 lot of respect
23:04 for a lot of the medical professionals
23:05 that are coming out trying to make this
23:08 a situation for everybody the other
23:11 interesting thing is that
23:13 because i smoke cigars and sit in
23:15 lounges i will meet medical doctors
23:18 who seem to have bags of hammers inside
23:21 their heads
23:22 i mean it is unbelievable what they
23:24 believe in the world as a whole and
23:27 it's unbelievable how they've been able
23:28 to operate in a medical profession
23:32 curing anyone helping anyone
23:36 and they don't have the first clue
23:37 what's going on in the world
23:39 in any vector away from their job
23:42 which might sound great might sound like
23:45 uh
23:46 well yeah i want my doctor to be 100
23:48 doctor doctor
23:49 and not you know worried about poli sci
23:53 the problem is is that the medical
23:55 profession is no longer
23:57 one of those professions that is that is
24:00 sequestered
24:01 and you're not like a farm doctor back
24:04 in the 1800s where you just learn the
24:06 wisdom
24:06 from first from med school but then you
24:08 you talk to other doctors and they're
24:10 like yeah that's bs
24:11 do this instead oh yeah okay great
24:13 little castor oil there a little
24:14 geritol there
24:18 nope they're being fed crap constantly
24:21 aren't they they're now trying to inject
24:25 everybody with something
24:26 once a year is what they really want to
24:28 do
24:30 genetic modification slowly but surely
24:33 and it's all about slow
24:37 eugenics 100
24:40 and it there's there's literal eugenics
24:42 which is your body will expire much
24:44 quicker if you happen to get this stuff
24:46 in your system
24:49 and then there's mental eugenics which
24:51 is your body's fine but your brain is
24:52 going to atrophy horribly
24:56 and therefore you might take your own
24:58 life you might become so
25:00 utterly useless that you know
25:03 your organs are the second thing to fail
25:06 because your brain's not working right
25:07 not talking to all your
25:08 your pumps and your vacillating arteries
25:12 and what have you
25:14 we have to be careful we have to be
25:17 extremely careful in this time
25:20 just imagine that you were raised in a
25:22 place where you believe
25:24 let's say let's say accurately that you
25:27 were getting at least decent information
25:30 because you were getting it from loved
25:31 ones as you grew up and
25:34 dealt with people outside your family
25:36 circle they're still good people
25:38 little town maybe or something like that
25:41 but up until whenever you venture out
25:43 into the world
25:44 which you don't have to do by the way
25:48 you had some pretty good rock solid
25:50 information good bedrock
25:52 lots of rocks and as soon as you go out
25:55 into the
25:56 quote-unquote real world and you go into
25:58 big cities and what have you
26:00 you're immediately told usually some
26:03 advice
26:03 like hey you're in a big city now so
26:05 there's a lot of scammers
26:07 what a woman asks you if you want to
26:08 have a good time and incas she likes
26:10 your eyes
26:12 when someone says they have a great
26:13 business venture just waiting for your
26:15 money
26:16 it's a sure sure thing a dead cert as
26:19 they say
26:20 they're lying and then you realize that
26:24 the fabric of a lot of things that
26:26 you're interacting with the corporations
26:28 the department stores the marketing
26:30 departments
26:30 are all lying to you potentially
26:34 they have histories of lying to you i'm
26:38 watching this
26:39 guy on youtube and maybe i'll uh
26:44 put his channel up on there
26:47 he's a guy that deals i think he's in
26:49 new york city somewhere in that region
26:51 and he does
26:51 repairs on apple equipment apple has
26:54 presented itself
26:55 since the amazing leader passed away
27:00 it is now not really a a computer
27:03 company or not really a cell phone
27:04 company or software company
27:06 it is the personal sort of
27:09 mardi gras float for tim cook's personal
27:12 psychosis
27:15 the corporation and its profits and
27:17 priorities are all
27:18 secondary to his personal message back
27:20 to his mommy
27:21 that he's a great guy it's very typical
27:24 of people like him to do this well
27:28 because the priorities have
27:29 been shifted to hey look over here look
27:32 over here
27:34 they're now starting to kind of do some
27:36 horrible things to their customers
27:39 one you should know their software is at
27:42 least on the phone is
27:43 way behind the competition and i mean
27:46 like
27:46 drastically behind so sad
27:49 doesn't have to be that way they now are
27:52 coming out with a
27:53 set of machines with this m1 chip that
27:56 apparently will not boot unless your
27:58 machine has access to the internet
28:00 you're not even going to be able to
28:01 launch an application if they decide
28:03 you shouldn't launch the application
28:06 because
28:07 every time you launch an application a
28:10 non-encrypted hash
28:11 sneaks out the network port to apple
28:14 and if it doesn't get an answer back
28:17 they won't let you launch an application
28:19 that amazing they are lying in the
28:22 genius bars and telling you that repairs
28:25 that would
28:26 sometimes be free are going to cost you
28:28 1200 bucks
28:31 this guy demonstrates it big surprise
28:34 there
28:36 but they have signed the deal with the
28:37 deep state for sure
28:39 100 and they are trying to do
28:42 what people tracking because of this
28:44 year
28:46 absolutely invading your privacy on a
28:49 level that's ridiculous
28:51 they wanted to get you to think that you
28:52 don't actually own anything that you buy
28:54 from
28:54 apple they want you to believe that
28:56 you're renting it from apple
28:58 that's pretty much what their warranties
29:00 say
29:01 and now they have almost completely
29:04 destroyed the ability for
29:05 third-party companies to do repairs on
29:07 their machines
29:08 and then they load up their genius bars
29:10 with a bunch of liars
29:12 and disgusting scumbags that deserve to
29:15 be in jail
29:17 to lie to you about the repairs on your
29:18 computer
29:20 and i've reported this in way before i
29:23 ever noticed this this year
29:24 i told you i think in an episode a long
29:27 time ago
29:29 you know i used to walk into the store
29:30 and when i get any lip
29:33 i pull out my business cards of
29:37 the people that i know at apple to get
29:39 them to to be cool
29:42 and they didn't even believe me at first
29:43 until they make a call to corporate or
29:45 something and then it was like
29:47 okay okay when that guy comes in don't
29:49 don't mess around get him his stuff
29:53 but i had a guy tell me once that my
29:56 computer was two years old and that's
29:57 all i should expect
29:59 it to last and i need to get a brand new
30:01 computer he thinks i'm an idiot of
30:03 course
30:05 which is so beautiful when you come in
30:08 looking like me and they're like oh god
30:09 we're gonna react this guy
30:13 death it's the ultimate experience
30:18 for an individual by themselves in this
30:21 reality
30:22 isn't it
30:25 birth is the most beautiful experience
30:28 you can have with another person
30:30 when you're with your wife or your
30:32 husband and someone's coming into this
30:34 world
30:35 i don't think there's anything more
30:37 amazing than that moment
30:40 and i think there's a catch-22 with
30:41 death
30:43 i think death is birth and i think death
30:45 is one of the most beautiful things that
30:47 can happen to us
30:49 but the simulation has a purpose
30:52 therefore we are to
30:56 be terrified of death so that we behave
30:59 so we try to live in this world as long
31:01 as we can and
31:02 potentially keep the uh the bistro
31:05 engine going
31:06 we're living out some earth program
31:11 trying to find the question to the
31:14 answer of life the universe and
31:16 everything i was watching an interview
31:19 with richard harris
31:20 on the dick cavett show this is the
31:23 interview where
31:24 richard harris comes in with a big giant
31:26 scar over his left eye
31:28 his bridge of his nose is busted he'd
31:31 been in a
31:32 bar fight the night before over a lady
31:35 he said
31:36 but he said he lost the fight but he i
31:39 think was the one that admitted he goes
31:41 you know
31:41 i'm really terrified of death and dick
31:44 cavett's like
31:45 what about death freaks you out and he
31:47 said um
31:50 just the idea of not existing is
31:53 something i don't like thinking about
31:56 but death is also one of those things
31:58 that we really can't conceive of right
32:02 i mean you can conceive of being sick
32:06 you might be able to if you've ushered
32:08 someone else out of this world when you
32:10 have the death rattle
32:12 being in that situation and struggling
32:15 to breathe and then eventually something
32:16 happens
32:19 again we've had what is it sam kinnison
32:24 did not wear his seatbelt when he was
32:25 driving from la or
32:27 las vegas to la with his new wife get
32:29 hit by a 17 year old kid head on
32:32 and he crushed his chest against the
32:34 steering wheel
32:36 he gets out of the car he sits down in a
32:39 ditch and he said he was okay he got
32:42 himself out and sat down
32:43 and they said that he was starting to
32:45 have a conversation with someone
32:49 and he said he didn't want to die and
32:50 then he said why do i have to die
32:53 and someone answered the question on the
32:55 other side and he said oh okay okay okay
32:58 and then he died steve jobs
33:01 he spent most of his life being very
33:03 secular eventually
33:05 on his deathbed was to say something
33:07 like oh wow oh wow oh wow
33:11 what do you think would have to happen
33:12 to make that guy say oh wow
33:15 it's not that ridiculous story they tell
33:17 you about the chemical drop in your
33:18 brain that makes you see light and
33:20 somehow you're constructing this tunnel
33:22 and everyone has the tunnel not
33:24 everybody has the tunnel folks
33:27 but that wouldn't blow steve away you
33:28 would be probably thinking about oh yeah
33:30 this is when that chemical drops and
33:32 okay here i go
33:33 this sucks but no he didn't have that
33:35 experience he had a beautiful experience
33:38 there's a moment when i think that we
33:40 cease to
33:42 to do this step this cartoon version of
33:45 death in our minds
33:46 where we blame things that may or may
33:49 not have contributed to our deaths
33:51 nothing that ever really makes us feel
33:53 tremendously
33:54 better but if you think of it as the
33:57 person
33:58 if you can basically indemnify the
34:00 person who's dying from being
34:02 responsible for their own death
34:04 it does feel better doesn't it
34:07 when it's an accident it feels better
34:09 than when it was intentional
34:11 when it was not the result of negligence
34:16 i had one of my girlfriend's uncles die
34:20 and the scenario was that he had some
34:23 friends over
34:24 to our little town and they ate dinner
34:26 and had a really good time
34:28 and then they left to go 100 miles back
34:30 home so two hour drive back home roughly
34:32 and he realized that somehow they left
34:37 some keys behind i don't understand
34:40 how they got in their car and turned it
34:41 on but for whatever reason i think
34:43 that's what the item was and he thought
34:45 oh my gosh they're going to get all the
34:46 way out the other side and not be able
34:47 to get in their house
34:50 it could have been something else but i
34:51 think that's what i was told
34:53 he hopped on his shorts
34:57 and a t-shirt and it was at night and
34:59 he's hauling butt well he doesn't have
35:01 much
35:02 distance to travel in his brain because
35:04 he's thinking i'm going to speed they
35:05 don't speed so i'll catch him within 10
35:07 miles or so
35:09 now nobody knows exactly what took place
35:13 they found him at this famous
35:15 intersection where the little country
35:16 road turns into a highway
35:18 and apparently his body was somewhere in
35:20 there and they think that he was going
35:21 too quick
35:22 and we don't know if he had
35:26 a blood alcohol problem it's not a real
35:29 big drinky family to be honest
35:33 there's some dirt and gravel and stuff
35:35 right that intersection but so when he
35:37 passed
35:38 there was sort of this
35:41 romantic feeling we had that he was such
35:43 a good guy
35:45 that he felt it was important that his
35:47 friends don't get home and and not be
35:48 able to access their home
35:50 he was a great guy everyone loved this
35:53 man
35:55 and he died with his
35:58 dignity one of my best friends in school
36:01 high school brilliant dude man i've
36:05 mentioned him a couple times in the past
36:06 he just walk into like a calculus class
36:08 and just ace it and
36:10 10 minutes later he's left the room
36:11 because nothing for him to do
36:14 he got so bored with life because he was
36:16 so brilliant he was like a scrapper he
36:18 was not like a
36:19 nerd in any way shape or form
36:23 and apparently the story is is that he i
36:26 know he got into theft
36:28 stealing in order to get the high like a
36:30 kleptomaniac does right
36:32 but he ended up selling drugs and
36:36 then he was murdered and pretty much
36:39 everybody thinks he got murdered by one
36:40 of the drug dealers
36:41 don't know i mean usually in the midwest
36:44 there's a reason why you get
36:46 murdered i mean and people would know
36:48 like if you walked out of a out of a
36:49 club and you were jerked everybody
36:51 inside and you called everybody names
36:53 we've had people get baseball batted and
36:55 parking lots and then they're gone
36:57 but then we're like well that guy was
36:59 drunk he was looking after those guys
37:01 everybody wasn't you know
37:05 cognizant of what they were doing they
37:06 all got stupid and he lost the game
37:10 when my buddy died it was kind of like
37:13 there wasn't the normal morning that you
37:15 would have and we definitely mourned
37:17 this guy being passed and the weird
37:20 thing about it was that
37:22 when i separated from my hometown i
37:24 didn't maintain contact with him because
37:26 we didn't have social media it wasn't
37:28 easy and i wasn't about to write him a
37:29 letter
37:30 hey buddy how you doing he moved around
37:33 i moved around wouldn't be able to find
37:34 each other
37:35 so i find out years later that this
37:37 guy's gone and i realized that just to
37:39 digitize a vhs tape of he and i
37:41 recording
37:42 some pretty funny stuff for a television
37:44 channel we had in my hometown
37:46 running around the basement so i cleaned
37:48 it all up and send it to his brother
37:51 just wild man for me
37:54 my my guilty
37:59 anthropomorphizing this is that i see
38:02 the whole thing and this is just i'm not
38:04 saying i'm right or anything like that
38:06 but in my brain
38:07 as you might guess i see this as a loop
38:10 of
38:11 existence you're human temporarily then
38:14 you probably take a break as your light
38:15 source
38:16 and then you probably participate in
38:18 some way shape or form your return
38:22 maybe you do the shirley maclean thing
38:24 where you choose every moment you choose
38:26 the difficulty of the video game and
38:27 then jump in
38:30 or maybe you just let it be random and
38:32 you're more concerned about the history
38:34 that you're jumping into
38:36 i've always said you know i got really
38:37 lucky
38:39 up to a point being born where i was
38:41 born
38:44 hopefully in the next two months here we
38:46 see something absolutely revolutionary
38:48 in world history
38:50 and it will be one of the most epic
38:52 times in life to be alive
38:54 it might get really dirty it might get
38:57 mean
38:58 but you know we read about things like
39:01 revolutions that made countries possible
39:04 that made
39:05 tyranny go away and freedom arrive and
39:07 so sometimes that's the case
39:10 i vacillated with the notion of like how
39:12 much do you
39:14 take life seriously because that's a
39:17 question isn't it
39:18 you don't have to yes you don't have to
39:22 take it seriously
39:23 you can kind of do whatever you want
39:26 some people don't and we know those
39:28 people and sometimes they're really
39:30 happy
39:31 now sometimes they get very unhealthy
39:33 because they take that to an absolute
39:35 extreme
39:37 we see people abuse themselves don't we
39:42 i can't remember that guy's name on
39:45 howard stern
39:46 who's the writer i don't think his name
39:49 was howie or something but he's the guy
39:51 that did so much cocaine his nose
39:53 started to disintegrate and it went out
39:54 a couple years ago
39:56 and you're looking at his picture going
39:58 man how do you and you've seen all kinds
40:01 of people who have abused meth
40:02 and stuff thank god a lot of meth damage
40:04 other than losing your teeth
40:06 but lesions on your skin and the sort of
40:09 sunken
40:10 face will repair itself to the point you
40:12 won't even know that that was ever
40:14 a particular person's past
40:18 but i've i've you know it's interesting
40:20 like i've met so many people through
40:23 film work and video games and just
40:26 meeting brilliant people and working
40:27 with them
40:30 and there was a scenario where
40:33 and just on the the subject of taking
40:36 life seriously or not taking life
40:37 seriously
40:39 a buddy of mine let's keep everything
40:41 double blinded here
40:42 a buddy of mine had a best friend this
40:44 guy is slightly older than me
40:47 and his best buddies from a really
40:50 affluent family
40:52 not from america from one of those
40:55 european countries
40:57 and his father was a prestigious dean at
41:00 one of the most prestigious colleges
41:02 in the world outside of the united
41:04 states
41:05 so really academically
41:08 blessed probably on a genetic level
41:11 academically blessed that he could get
41:13 into these schools probably for a very
41:14 affordable amount of money
41:17 but his father blessed him so much
41:21 with this lifestyle
41:26 that the guy just didn't have to work i
41:28 mean he
41:29 kind of was like a little he was in the
41:31 hippie era so he really lived the hippie
41:34 era to the nines man and very creatively
41:36 so
41:37 extremely smart guy extremely brilliant
41:40 guy
41:41 usually was on the precipice of
41:44 emerging technologies he has a couple
41:47 quirky talents
41:50 and when i saw pictures of when he was
41:51 young
41:53 just a very handsome guy and
41:56 then i had actually i believe i
41:59 chatted with him through skype a couple
42:01 times
42:03 because we were working on a project and
42:05 they were like hey you gotta work with
42:06 this guy to get this thing done it was
42:08 definitely a privilege to do so and i
42:10 started to realize that this gentleman
42:13 had about two teeth in his mouth
42:16 when he talked you know it's really
42:19 interesting when you have like a real
42:20 prominent giant tooth and then there's
42:22 nothing else there
42:25 and it started to just baffle me and
42:28 actually asked my buddy i said you know
42:29 what's the deal with the teeth man and
42:31 he was like yeah he goes when we were
42:32 young dental care was
42:34 non-existent i said yeah well you gotta
42:36 do a lot more than just not brush your
42:38 teeth man
42:39 it's like yeah everything was bad and
42:42 that we were hoping that this gentleman
42:43 was gonna get his teeth
42:45 uh the last couple pulled out and get
42:47 some new dentures in there or something
42:48 to give him
42:49 kind of his face back you know i
42:52 remember that session
42:54 sticking with me for years because i was
42:57 thinking gosh man
42:59 why is it that that people who should
43:02 never make any money
43:03 because they never have any good things
43:05 to do with it always get it all and the
43:07 folks that have the greatest ideas
43:09 and and dedication to actually forge
43:12 something into reality can never get any
43:14 cash at all
43:16 i've been obsessed with i'm kind of out
43:18 of it now but
43:19 i've been obsessed this year with
43:21 watching these
43:22 car crash compilation videos like i
43:25 mentioned a couple times before
43:27 there's nothing more interesting than
43:30 seeing
43:31 a couple things people with really
43:33 expensive cars drive like
43:35 absolute morons and you're like how did
43:38 you earn the money to buy
43:40 this car but you don't know that you
43:41 shouldn't turn left across three lanes
43:44 really strange and funny thing i was
43:46 watching
43:48 probably about three months into this
43:49 little habit
43:51 and i was pushing play on this video and
43:53 the second car crash
43:55 was a crash one block from where i'm
43:56 sitting right now it's on my street
43:59 i actually passed the accident a week
44:01 before it turned up on the internet
44:03 really funny i didn't know how the
44:04 accident occurred and i got to watch it
44:06 happen it was like oh my god just read
44:08 the
44:08 street cross streets and it was like
44:10 that's right where i live oh my god
44:12 crazy but the other one is this
44:16 sort of ridiculous carefree nature of
44:20 driving badly you see it all the time
44:24 with
44:25 young kids on motorcycles you know your
44:29 sort of faux banger who's in a car and
44:32 filming the sp speedometer
44:36 just saw one the other day where a guy
44:37 drove a tesla 135 miles an hour in
44:40 residential
44:43 he found out the hard way that
44:45 residential streets aren't paved for
44:46 those kind of
44:48 speeds and he crossed a
44:51 an intersection nobody got hurt nobody
44:53 else was there but
44:55 he realized that the uh the intersection
44:58 was a ramp
44:59 basically at 135 miles an hour can't
45:01 really see what happens but you
45:02 definitely hear a lot of
45:04 screeching in bats that was a tesla okay
45:07 probably dad's tesla is like the only
45:09 thing i can imagine
45:11 but i think that as we see things in the
45:13 world where people are risking their
45:15 lives
45:16 we sort of cartoon
45:19 their existence in their mind like we
45:21 vicariously cartoon it in their brain
45:24 we go this person can't possibly be
45:26 taking life serious
45:28 and we know there's this weird threshold
45:30 again the military is isolated
45:32 down to the the year of being 23 years
45:35 old
45:36 is the last possible year that a male
45:39 typically with any intelligence
45:41 thinks that there's no value to life or
45:44 the counter belief which is i am
45:47 invincible
45:49 can't imagine dying so i'll do anything
45:52 and you know there's pluses and minuses
45:54 with that old thing
45:56 if you've never done anything
45:59 interesting you know jump off a cliff
46:00 into some water
46:01 jump out of a plane with a parachute on
46:03 and all these things that you might be
46:04 afraid of otherwise
46:06 when you become too sentient to the idea
46:09 of
46:09 of dying you don't want to be
46:12 stuck in some box somewhere so some
46:15 people make a career
46:17 out of risking life constantly
46:21 and there's a certain amount of respect
46:22 i have for those individuals
46:24 one because i don't think they truly die
46:26 i just think their body goes away
46:28 i do think if you have children who are
46:30 young or still going to need a lot of
46:32 mom or dad's advice that risking your
46:34 life is
46:35 sort of irresponsible because again once
46:37 you conceive a child
46:38 and you plan on being a part of their
46:40 life your
46:42 your game's over it's all about their
46:44 game
46:45 now it will come back to you because
46:47 eventually they're going to be
46:48 pretty autonomous but
46:52 even though let's just say your kid
46:54 during their 20s is very
46:56 introverted trying to get their game on
46:57 trying to get their salary up trying to
46:59 get a good job or whatever
47:00 amassed things that you have by the time
47:04 they hit their 30s they're willing to
47:05 sit down and go
47:07 tell me about grandma you know or your
47:08 grandma or where are we
47:10 native american are we german what are
47:12 we you know and you'll get to answer
47:14 those questions
47:16 and they'll be interested in hearing the
47:18 answers as they become more mature
47:20 hopefully
47:21 those sessions will be amazing
47:24 i think that the one moment when death
47:28 really meets the pavement
47:30 in terms of tread in our minds
47:34 is when you have someone who dies that
47:36 doesn't want to die
47:38 they don't necessarily think they're
47:40 going to a bad place by any means but
47:42 they're too young
47:43 and they had a premeditated situation
47:46 where
47:47 the illness got on them and took a year
47:50 or two
47:51 and they're waking up every day going i
47:53 just don't want to die i just don't want
47:54 to die i just don't want to die that's
47:55 not the thought to have by the way
47:58 i thought to have is i'm so glad i'm
48:01 healthy
48:03 and you eat right and you cut down on
48:04 whatever's causing your illness to
48:06 happen
48:08 get whatever treatment that works for
48:10 you
48:11 but once you experience that personally
48:14 and you're not the one who's passing
48:17 and you take them all the way to the end
48:19 then you're
48:20 you have a different outlook on life
48:22 don't you you see this whole thing
48:26 now i think 2020 is probably
48:30 having profoundly different effects on
48:33 individuals
48:34 in this particular realm we have young
48:37 people
48:38 committing suicide we have older people
48:40 committing suicide
48:43 suicide is obviously usually some
48:46 situation where you feel like there's no
48:49 hope
48:50 whatever is today you believe mistakenly
48:54 that it's going to persist and not
48:56 change
48:59 when you get older like me and i've got
49:01 plenty of friends i smoke with that have
49:03 these
49:05 same exact feelings
49:08 there is a point where you've lived so
49:10 much of your life you're like jeez what
49:12 can i do now
49:13 and the more that you succeed as a young
49:15 person
49:16 and then you get older you
49:19 sometimes can lose faith that you can do
49:23 equally amazing things in the present
49:26 because you're thinking oh man i only
49:28 was able to do those particular things
49:29 because i was young and had a lot of
49:31 energy
49:33 not realizing there's a bunch of new
49:34 stuff that you only you can do because
49:36 you're older
49:38 you're more subdued your wisdom levels
49:40 are through the roof
49:43 and what you can go do the young person
49:45 can't
49:46 and maybe it's more subtle maybe you're
49:48 going to write a nice book
49:50 maybe you're going to advise someone
49:53 maybe you're going to conceive of a
49:54 business that doesn't really take a lot
49:55 of sweat
49:57 was gonna be very profitable maybe it's
50:00 just
50:01 you've got an income it's steady and
50:03 you're gonna spend most of your time
50:05 meeting your family your friends maybe
50:08 like one of the funniest things when you
50:10 live next to a beach and i'm sure
50:12 several of you do if you don't live next
50:15 to a beach just pick something in your
50:16 neighborhood that is typically the
50:18 reason why tourism
50:19 happens in your area when you live next
50:22 to the beach
50:24 you rarely go to the beach i mean you
50:26 drive by it all the time it's always a
50:28 beautiful sight
50:28 but getting there parking your car
50:30 paying 10 14
50:32 to park you know three and a half miles
50:33 from your house
50:35 it's frustrating
50:39 so we don't go a lot but when we do
50:41 we're so happy that we did
50:43 the sound of the waves you know that's
50:46 god's voice talking to you
50:48 that's literally what his voice sounds
50:49 like he's got many voices but that's one
50:51 of them man
50:52 just just that white noise is there to
50:55 give you
50:57 your peace it overwhelms your thought
51:01 process
51:01 because it is all sounds at all times
51:05 and it says rest rest your mind
51:09 let go of all the stuff you were hanging
51:11 on to before you got here
51:13 and let me give you the universe
51:17 and you get a tan while you're doing it
51:18 most the time so there are all these
51:21 things around us
51:24 that because they become patterns they
51:27 get canceled in our minds
51:29 and when it gets canceled then you don't
51:32 see it anymore
51:35 this episode is hopefully going to even
51:38 though it's meandering
51:39 in topic give you some scaffolding
51:43 some support mechanisms whereby you can
51:48 realize someone else is having the
51:50 thoughts that you might be having
51:52 but also see things from a non-trivial
51:58 perspective so that you have
52:02 you don't lose sight let's just say of
52:04 the toolbox that you've built your
52:06 entire life that
52:07 has the tools to solve these problems
52:10 i think 2021 is going to be a good year
52:14 i think it's going to be a wild year
52:16 hopefully it's not a tremendously
52:18 violent year but it could be
52:20 quite frankly it could be we have the uh
52:23 what is it the president of canada has
52:25 invited china
52:26 to put all of its troops in canada
52:30 and that's a really suspect little thing
52:32 to do not that it's going to be a
52:34 problem
52:35 could be weird but let's just say it
52:37 turns out okay
52:39 well here's what we want to have happen
52:41 as this stuff boils off
52:43 as the world refuses to take bogus
52:46 science
52:47 and be constrained by it we want to come
52:50 out of that
52:51 gate like the best kentucky derby horse
52:54 that has ever been bred that's ever been
52:56 taught how to race
52:58 and while all the other horses are fat
53:00 and atrophied
53:02 both mentally and physically and
53:04 spiritually
53:06 we're blasting and it's just like being
53:10 a sooner
53:11 in the united states when
53:14 the individuals who were forming
53:17 oklahoma
53:18 and a bunch of people were told okay
53:22 you're gonna get on the southern kansas
53:24 border with all your stakes and your
53:26 ropes and your horses and what have you
53:28 and tomorrow morning at a certain time
53:30 everyone can cross the border and
53:31 whatever land you can
53:33 grab is yours of course a bunch of
53:35 jerk-offs went across the night before
53:36 and grabbed a bunch of land
53:39 it's always weird when that happens
53:40 because you're liking is oklahoma made
53:42 of a bunch of
53:42 sooners the answer is usually no but
53:45 there are some families that are
53:46 definitely sooner genetics right
53:49 but we want to be whatever you can
53:53 because you're you might be in a region
53:54 of the world where you can move today
53:56 australia again i just saw a video of
53:58 australia
54:00 it so it gets so strange i reported in
54:02 one episode that that it was announced
54:04 that there were parts of australia they
54:05 were under
54:06 martial law to keep everybody inside and
54:08 then i just saw a video from
54:10 daily dose of internet where they've
54:12 opened up giant regions and everyone's
54:13 walking around
54:14 completely without that thing on their
54:16 face not a single person
54:19 in fact in the video i saw a couple
54:20 people cough and i just thought it was
54:22 funny we're dealing with the situation
54:25 this year on many levels right
54:29 almost every conceivable level of your
54:31 existence is being assaulted
54:34 it's being insulted as well as assaulted
54:37 and so a lot of you are being steadfast
54:40 about it
54:41 our moderator dave has been an absolute
54:44 knight in shining armor in this realm
54:46 and so when
54:50 this ends we want to literally go back
54:52 to our lives
54:53 it's it's really tense amount to a
54:55 soldier
54:56 who joins the the military during
54:59 a crisis where you have a war going on
55:03 and then they run off for potentially
55:04 four or five years i mean vietnam you
55:06 could have run away for 15 years
55:08 depending on how many tours you did
55:09 and then you've lived this in completely
55:11 different existence and i mean
55:13 nothing that you grew up with is around
55:15 you the hardships are
55:19 are exhaustively huge and then you
55:22 all of a sudden get this radio call
55:25 it's over and you almost can't process
55:28 that it's over because it's been
55:30 constant it's been tumultuous and
55:33 you just never visioned it being done
55:36 because you couldn't tell yourself in
55:38 the morning as a soldier this is going
55:39 to end today
55:40 you couldn't because then you wouldn't
55:42 fight as strong
55:44 and you wouldn't have the faculties to
55:46 last another day on the field right
55:50 but can you imagine this has
55:53 happened many many times in history
55:55 where individuals are on some
55:56 battlefield
55:58 they don't think it's ever going to end
55:59 and then it does and then within
56:01 a month they're home with their families
56:04 eating a
56:05 huge dinner a giant spread of
56:10 turkey and mashed potatoes and
56:12 everything whatever you like to eat
56:14 and you're sitting there with people at
56:16 the table that didn't go to war
56:19 and you're like you're looking around
56:20 and you're super happy to be there
56:23 maybe a little ptsd you don't know yet
56:25 but you're eating this food going oh my
56:27 god
56:28 i just switched realities i went from
56:30 war
56:31 to peace well we're going to have
56:35 a small part of that next year or
56:39 whenever we get this thing
56:41 sorted out and we're probably going to
56:44 have some areas of the world they're
56:45 going to sort it out peacefully and
56:46 we're going to have some areas of the
56:47 world they're going to have to fight for
56:49 their constitution
56:53 man you imagine me being a reporter in
56:55 the battlefields
56:57 yeah because i had this show i went down
56:59 today to huntington beach and there was
57:01 a big
57:01 rally going on that was very positive
57:03 there was a couple people
57:05 trying to agitate
57:08 they happened to be breaking the law and
57:09 so they got
57:11 it's pulled aside very quickly
57:15 so we're seeing a little bit of stuff
57:17 and what's interesting is we have these
57:18 agitators that are coming in from other
57:20 towns
57:22 and boy in the midwest it wouldn't go
57:25 down as nice as it just did today
57:27 i mean you wouldn't have a situation
57:28 where someone literally drives from
57:30 their crappy part of the world into your
57:32 world
57:33 spewing against you and they get to
57:36 drive home at night
57:37 but um i guess i'm glad that that isn't
57:40 what we're doing now but part of me is
57:42 like okay
57:44 desperate measures for desperate times
57:47 i want you to think about how you've
57:49 processed
57:50 the ultimate death in
57:54 your life other people even celebrities
57:57 that you could can't believe they're
57:59 gone already
58:01 it's an amazing thing it's an amazing
58:04 thing you know
58:05 when we lose our relatives then then the
58:08 suffering is very proprietary and the
58:10 only way that we get
58:12 true sympathy that we can respect is if
58:15 we are talking to someone who has
58:17 suffered the same loss
58:18 in their realm so let's say you lose
58:21 your mom and someone else has lost their
58:22 mom
58:23 generally the same age maybe both
58:26 situations
58:27 they should have lived another 10 20
58:29 years easy something happened
58:32 and so it's much it's much more
58:35 challenging to
58:36 get that feeling like anyone understands
58:38 you that's around you
58:39 you know there's millions of people
58:40 understand you but you don't know them
58:42 physically
58:43 so you can't talk to them
58:46 when a celebrity passes away aka
58:50 flying quotes whatever then we have a
58:52 situation where
58:54 it's the losses is more
58:58 understood by the masses
59:01 you know i wasn't alive actually sorry i
59:04 was i was alive when all the 27s passed
59:06 out of the
59:07 hippie era but when
59:10 i just gave an example
59:13 when stevie ray vaughan died in his
59:16 helicopter accident
59:18 in the late 80s i was
59:21 super duper into him i was learning the
59:24 guitar to his music
59:26 not that i got close to his playing
59:27 style at all
59:29 but i was just literally i just bought a
59:31 guitar i'm at home doing like you know
59:33 sometimes like three or four hour
59:34 sessions
59:35 just riffing over his stuff trying to
59:37 learn it and i'm at work
59:40 and the first report that came in was
59:41 that eric clapton had passed away
59:44 and not that i want anyone else to pass
59:45 away in place of somebody else
59:47 i didn't know eric that well in terms of
59:49 the music i know i didn't like his music
59:51 much uh no offense his stuff is
59:54 extremely depressing
59:56 but he's extremely talented guy take
59:58 nothing away from and then it was like
60:00 a part of me inside was going
60:04 the old guy left the new guy's still
60:07 here right the revolution
60:08 in blue's guitar is still here and the
60:11 guy that's
60:12 passe has died and then an hour later
60:15 again no internet at this point it's the
60:18 other way
60:18 the young one passed and the uh
60:22 the old one's still here now again i'm
60:24 nothing against eric clapton okay
60:29 but then it was like uh about a month
60:32 ago i found this
60:33 dude on the on the internet i forgot his
60:35 name's a black guy that wears glasses he
60:37 has a beard
60:38 he does these reaction videos to music
60:41 and he's just a delight man i'll put his
60:42 channel up there so you can see it
60:45 i love this guy i love the way he reacts
60:47 he's exactly like the dudes that i grew
60:48 up with
60:50 he sounds like bill bellamy which is
60:51 really funny
60:54 but he reacted to one of the most famous
60:57 recordings
60:58 of steve ray vaughn's playing voodoo
61:01 child
61:02 which is obviously a hendrix tune in
61:05 texas
61:05 on some stage just a couple months
61:08 before he passed and if you haven't seen
61:10 this performance it is and you like
61:12 guitar playing
61:14 it's just it's just ungodly how amazing
61:17 this about 10 minute video is of him
61:20 playing this
61:22 if you've attempted to play the guitar
61:25 your jaw's on the ground if you play
61:26 guitar your jaw's through the floor
61:29 because this guy's amazing and i sat
61:32 there
61:34 finding myself reliving his death
61:40 and it was one of these things where i'm
61:41 just zipping through this
61:43 other dude's channel right and i'm i'm
61:45 watching him the first one was he
61:47 reacted to
61:48 black betty which is a great video you
61:50 got to watch him
61:51 react to but he gets to this one and i'm
61:54 sitting there and i just started
61:56 just weeping i just couldn't stop the
61:59 tears man i'm just like oh my [ __ ]
62:02 god this guy's gone
62:04 and of course we lost hendrix we lost
62:07 janice joplin morse
62:09 jim morrison who lost all these people
62:11 before they were 30
62:12 tons of them all amazing all would have
62:15 created another album of something
62:16 amazing
62:18 but i was trying to you know after i got
62:20 done
62:22 and this dude was appreciating him the
62:24 way i would which is great it's always
62:25 feels good when you have a kindred soul
62:27 sort of thing
62:29 that's why i think i like this guy he
62:31 seems like what i like
62:33 but uh i went back and i was trying to
62:37 think about
62:37 oh because then i was at the lounge and
62:39 i was like dude you guys got to watch
62:40 this guy he's great and i started
62:42 playing his videos and
62:42 everyone's laughing and so put the
62:45 stevie one on
62:47 and we got a bunch of old guys in the
62:50 room as well
62:51 who definitely know stevie was the bomb
62:54 and we're all just watching this thing i
62:56 didn't i said you know i'm not gonna
62:57 play the whole thing but just
62:58 take a look and nobody seemed bored
63:02 but everybody's just in awe and i'm
63:05 wondering like
63:06 for me i think it was just that i felt
63:08 like this guy was just getting to his
63:10 prime and he got lifted out of the world
63:14 that for me was the thing and it used to
63:17 be when i was younger
63:18 there was always that sort of saying
63:20 that was something like uh
63:21 oh god works in mysterious ways and
63:23 you're like okay
63:24 i guess he wants a good guitar player in
63:26 heaven you know one of those kind of
63:27 silly
63:28 thought processes i have to say the
63:30 music in heaven's got to be great right
63:34 but it was just interesting to go back
63:36 and think about like why was i so
63:37 emotional
63:40 and part of me was thinking because of
63:44 other experiences in my life
63:47 i was at work when i heard this
63:49 information about him passing
63:52 so i had to swallow any emotions plus i
63:54 was probably in shock
63:56 plus i had distractions which was work
63:59 and so i didn't have to
64:00 process that information same thing
64:04 happened to me when i when prince passed
64:05 away
64:06 i'm at an interview i'm at a job
64:08 interview and i get my
64:10 phone starts blowing up and i'm like i'm
64:11 not looking at my phone i'm at an
64:12 interview i'm at the break
64:14 it hasn't even really started yet and
64:15 then all of a sudden i was like okay
64:17 wait a minute my phone has got like
64:19 20 text messages in it all happening in
64:22 the last five minutes like
64:23 something like would the world blow up
64:25 and i'm just not feeling shockwave yet
64:27 so i look in there
64:28 so i couldn't process it i did do an
64:30 episode that
64:32 that day and it definitely got emotional
64:34 and then i re-recorded it
64:37 and uh but i still had just
64:40 couldn't process this dude dying huge
64:43 part of my life
64:44 that's why my phone broke blew up
64:45 because people knew my connection with
64:46 this dude
64:47 so i'm
64:51 probably about two or three weeks
64:52 probably
64:54 one or two weeks away from this him
64:56 dying
64:57 and i was just sitting in my office just
65:00 going oh my god i just got to deal with
65:02 this
65:03 and i'm looking at videos of him playing
65:06 and one came on where he's playing it's
65:08 a very recent one
65:10 at the time especially with his all
65:12 chick band and
65:14 it says something about frankenstein
65:16 i've told this once before but
65:17 him playing frankenstein which is edgar
65:19 winter's song which my father raised me
65:20 on if you haven't heard frankenstein i'm
65:23 like god
65:24 get to it but that was the call sign
65:27 between my father and i frankenstein
65:29 nobody
65:30 nobody ever listens to edgar winters
65:31 frankenstein except dude's in the 70s
65:34 and then i'm watching this thing and he
65:35 does like you know a little bit of um
65:39 let's go crazy and then all of a sudden
65:42 his bass player chick comes in and
65:43 starts
65:47 like what now get this
65:50 get this man i'm i'm watching this video
65:55 i'm getting totally emotional men my
65:58 eyes are just
65:59 fountains man
66:04 so i'm watching this and what am i
66:05 thinking of i'm watching prince
66:07 and i'm thinking of my old man and i'm
66:09 thinking this
66:11 is almost like prince coming back to one
66:13 dropping a little
66:14 you're going to want to see this after
66:16 i'm gone this is my
66:18 message to you personally dude watch me
66:21 play
66:21 one of your favorite songs that has
66:23 never even rumored to be played by this
66:25 dude
66:26 so i'm watching this and my phone goes
66:30 i look down and it's my father texting
66:33 me
66:34 saying i can't believe he's gone or i
66:36 still can't believe he's gone
66:38 right while i'm watching frankenstein
66:41 coming out of prince
66:42 with his whole band and my old man the
66:45 only other person in the world i'm
66:46 thinking of text me
66:47 talk about connections right that
66:49 ethereal wind man just was like hey dad
66:51 something's going on here right and so i
66:54 immediately text him the
66:57 the performance
67:01 and it was like this little chotsky
67:02 between my dad and i prince
67:04 it was just crazy
67:07 but there's a cartoon moment going on
67:10 there
67:11 sort of me thinking things are happening
67:15 that may not be happening maybe he did
67:16 truly just put that back there and go
67:18 okay
67:19 can i go down one more time and edit my
67:21 pass to stick this performance in here
67:23 because there's one kid
67:24 and yeah that's just fiction
67:27 most likely maybe not though and that
67:30 would be super cool if it were
67:32 if you have similar experiences like
67:34 this and you're willing to share them in
67:36 the comments please do
67:38 because this is like one of those areas
67:41 where we all think about it we all deal
67:43 with it
67:44 but almost nobody talks about it
67:47 that's like again what i said in my
67:48 suicide episode who walks in the room
67:51 and says uh
67:51 how you doing man and the other guy goes
67:53 i'm thinking about killing myself
67:55 oh really well let's have a conversation
67:56 about that that never happens does it
67:59 but it should it should if you have that
68:03 feeling you shouldn't be it almost
68:04 should be you're raised with that
68:07 sensibility when you're young okay if
68:09 you ever feel like hurting yourself
68:11 don't crawl into a box and don't be
68:14 embarrassed that is when you come to
68:15 mommy or daddy
68:17 or or mom and dad or your buddies or
68:19 somebody and you tell somebody
68:21 don't feel weird just let them know you
68:23 had a little spurt of a weird emotion
68:27 and then we'll talk you through it and
68:28 you'll probably feel a heck of a lot
68:30 better
68:31 maybe you just need to get around us a
68:32 little bit more maybe you're too much in
68:34 your apartment and i'm worried about
68:35 some
68:36 cg model coming to kill you
68:40 anyway i think you feel me
68:43 i'm gonna pepper these episodes into the
68:45 other more
68:46 sort of exciting episode topics i am
68:50 getting into a bunch of
68:52 topics that are requiring a lot of
68:54 research
68:55 but it's good research it's exciting
68:58 research exciting subject matter so i
69:00 hope you guys
69:02 i think you'll really dig it and we're
69:03 gonna we're gonna reprise a few
69:05 episodes from the past where the
69:07 research was not really there
69:10 so that we can basically say this one's
69:13 good
69:13 that one's crap maybe we can even retire
69:15 the old ones
69:17 but we'll have a much better replacement
69:19 so if you have subjects by the way you
69:21 want me to cover
69:23 i keep forgetting to say this please put
69:25 them in the
69:26 comments below go to facebook and tell
69:27 me whatever i don't want to push anymore
69:30 you know social media but
69:34 you can always contact me at youtube at
69:36 deepthoughtsradio.com
69:37 it doesn't go to youtube it comes
69:38 straight to me

69:42 deepthoughtsradio.com in general
69:44 we have two video two audio social media
69:48 all new remastered season one i also
69:51 have reduced the size of some of the
69:53 mp3s because depending on where i am and

69:58 best software so i take some of the
70:00 episodes from a hundred and
70:02 something meg down to like 60. so
70:05 less than half to download now like
70:07 episode 520
70:08 was gigantic it's like 120 meg and i got
70:10 it down to like
70:12 60 without injuring the quality at all i
70:16 did put up a new
70:17 t-shirt for the season six that will not
70:20 be
70:20 remotely the end of season six i also
70:22 took down the season five stuff
70:24 so you can't get those anymore and i'm
70:27 gonna be
70:28 putting up some hopefully more funny
70:31 creations up there so we can have some
70:32 fun
