00:30 welcome back ladies and gentlemen the
00:32 deep thoughts on this extremely cold
00:36 Wednesday morning it's about 2:00 in the
00:40 morning well it looks like it's to 25 in
00:43 the morning it's 47 degrees out here
00:46 Fahrenheit
00:47 just so you guys know I run this little
00:49 tiny heater at my feet but that does
00:54 very little for the rest of my body I
00:57 had these really cool gloves I forgot to
01:00 grab out of my car which had the fingers
01:01 cut off so today I thought I would do a
01:05 bonus episode because I haven't done any
01:06 bonus episodes for season 5 and usually
01:12 bonus episodes are like very timely
01:15 episodes that if they need to they can
01:17 go away in most cases I keep them I did
01:23 one on Donald Trump specifically back
01:27 when he got before he got elected I did
01:29 one called killing the president after
01:34 Kathy Griffin did her little stunt and
01:36 everyone else ran their mouth about how
01:38 they want to basically kill the
01:40 president
01:41 blow up the White House enact killing
01:43 but excuse me Trump in some music video
01:47 but now we have an impeachment situation
01:50 which is complete [ __ ] right I mean
01:53 it'll never go anywhere but I want to
01:56 get at some issues because we have crazy
02:02 running the house and I mean they must
02:07 have boy touching videos or some sort of
02:10 money laundering I don't know they must
02:15 have the most incredible crimes on these
02:19 people in the house that are Democrats
02:22 like we have never seen in history
02:27 because it defies logic that an average
02:33 citizen watching supposedly okay an
02:36 educated citizen
02:38 who is a house representative and some
02:41 of these [ __ ] mothballs have been in
02:42 there forever
02:43 right but they just conducted something
02:48 that is the most reprehensible
02:51 act that you've ever seen and it's not
02:55 because necessarily they did they did it
02:57 to Trump Trump is a big boy he's used to
02:59 being tossed around quite a bit if
03:03 anyone can take it that do can take it
03:05 and it's just like you know little speck
03:09 off his shoulder but the reason why I'm
03:11 making this episode is so that you
03:13 understand especially if you're a United
03:15 States citizen you never want this to
03:20 happen to you because what they did in
03:24 the house was not a legal procedure what
03:28 they did was they had a little slumber
03:30 party
03:30 of ugly people trying to get at
03:34 everybody else and I mean ugly to the
03:37 core just so happened some of them are
03:39 not very attractive
03:40 but some of them are but they're ugly
03:42 human beings and they believe that
03:45 they're ugly human beings plus he's the
03:48 kind of person who seems like the hot
03:50 chick that sort of dates the nerd so she
03:52 could [ __ ] be superior over them
03:54 that's how she strikes me Nadler I think
03:57 he's a boy a toucher
03:58 I think shift is most definitely a boy
04:01 toucher they got this guy by the balls
04:04 you know they probably up some obscene
04:05 [ __ ] on him or some other stuff it's
04:07 just more hardcore than that because I
04:10 can tell you that looking in the faces
04:12 of these putrid excuses for homeless a
04:17 peon you can see in some of their faces
04:20 they don't want to be there I don't
04:23 think now there really wants to be doing
04:25 it I don't think shift wants to be doing
04:27 it because just look at their face it's
04:30 like someone's got a gun to the back of
04:32 their head and it's like you know
04:34 they're telling him to go on the
04:37 playground naked and masturbate in front
04:39 of all the children it's like he's like
04:40 oh my god really and you know he just
04:42 sits there day after day pulling this
04:46 unbelievable
04:47 poorly orchestrated poorly thought-out
04:50 scam
04:51 and now I've seen hit least one of my
04:54 celebrity friends in Hollywood who will
04:58 remain nameless she is going to go do
05:02 some vigil in LA could happen tonight I
05:05 don't remember because she is so [ __ ]
05:08 thick-headed as talented as she is to
05:12 read a line and make us laugh on camera
05:14 her academic knowledge of how this world
05:18 works on a legal level on a
05:20 constitutional level on a country that
05:24 was found on a republic you know the
05:27 executive branch the judicial branch
05:30 she doesn't understand them and so she's
05:33 so happy that this happened when it if
05:35 this was your party and you had just the
05:39 most basic education of law and
05:42 especially how one drafts articles of
05:44 impeachment the fact that you have to
05:47 have one crime and you can't just make
05:49 up words and call them crimes you know
05:53 the reason I'm making this episode is if
05:56 you were tried like this you would think
05:59 we had gone into whatever farcical world
06:04 you can imagine again I always say thx
06:07 one with Reid but any sort of bizarre
06:10 kangaroo court proceeding you would be
06:14 looking at me that's almost like again
06:15 the witch in you know Monty Python and
06:20 the Holy Grail their logic for why she
06:24 was a witch because she she floats on
06:26 water and therefore what else floats on
06:28 water a duck well therefore if she
06:30 weighs the same as a duck she's a witch
06:32 and she's literally obviously weighs
06:35 more than a duck but somehow they put
06:36 her in this you know scale of justice
06:39 and she weighed as much as a duck and so
06:42 they killed her as he put the artificial
06:45 nose on her right so I want to review
06:52 what's really going on here because I'm
06:56 gonna miss a bunch of details because
06:57 the details are so absolutely deep that
07:01 it would take me hours and hours and
07:03 hours
07:04 you would get tired of listening to me
07:06 talk about this now for those who think
07:10 that this is about a Trump situation
07:13 yeah again his name's gonna come up in
07:16 this episode a lot because he's the one
07:17 currently being attacked but if this
07:20 happened to you I'd be making episode
07:22 about you right Julian Assange for
07:26 instance is another a kangaroo court
07:28 situation this guy has had all of his
07:32 rape charges dismissed so there's no
07:36 more crimes
07:36 you know his crime is being given emails
07:42 and publishing them in batches okay
07:46 WikiLeaks still works right they still
07:50 release information about the guy
07:52 they're trying to kill him in prison by
07:55 starving him to death you know now one
07:58 of the tricks about that guy is that
07:59 being in an infirmary is the best place
08:02 to be when you're in a Correctional
08:04 Center because you're not in your cell
08:05 so they say he's dying in prison yeah
08:09 it's an old scam that they used to do he
08:11 needs to get to America trumple pardoned
08:14 the dude and c'est la vie
08:16 welcome to Vegas welcome to LA whatever
08:18 you want to live so this impeachment
08:21 thing again it's the last big he'll
08:25 marry from the Democrats to try and hurt
08:27 Trump which is pathetic because they
08:29 know the Senate will never pass it if
08:33 you know worst case scenario
08:34 Trump gets kicked out of office a few
08:37 months before his reelection
08:38 so then he just gets he gets a chance to
08:40 run again he would win again and he gets
08:43 two more terms so he gets the next term
08:46 and there cuz it nullifies his entire
08:48 presidency if he were truly kicked out
08:50 of office so the guy gets to come back
08:53 and run as if he never was a president
08:54 can you imagine not today as of the was
09:00 that the I could see 18th we have the
09:04 house doing the first thing that they
09:06 have done since they've been in office
09:07 which is passed a one point four billion
09:09 dollar bill that will now go to the
09:12 Senate which funds the border which cuts
09:15 off the Obamacare penalties
09:18 and funds a bunch of crap on there in
09:20 two you know it's sort of the normal
09:23 thing that should happen is if we were
09:24 getting along right makes you wonder if
09:26 all that shit's been negotiating the
09:28 background now I want to say that before
09:31 I get too deep in this I'm gonna try to
09:33 preemptively strike a few comments here
09:37 one we're constantly told that we're
09:40 watching a show or watching theater and
09:43 then we forget that statement this is a
09:47 cue thing then we forget the statement
09:49 and we re-engage the theaters if it's
09:50 real so who knows what is actually going
09:53 on here is real you know it could be one
09:57 of these situations I'm just gonna throw
09:59 this out it's just a complete hypothesis
10:01 of you know crazy what if they had all
10:06 these folks dead to rights like you keep
10:08 saying everyone they have all the
10:11 pedophilia elitism Nancy Pelosi selling
10:15 guns you know through North Korea with
10:17 the CIA she admitted on the day she gave
10:20 her tribute to Barbara Bush on a c-span
10:23 braggadocious video which key linked us
10:26 to they got them all and they're like
10:28 okay guys here's what's gonna happen
10:31 you were going to orchestrate the end of
10:34 the Democratic Party and here's the
10:37 script and it's we're gonna make this
10:40 look good
10:41 right so you're gonna fight us tooth and
10:43 nail you're gonna go for Russia Kalu's
10:45 you're gonna go for this and you're not
10:46 gonna vote on anything you're not gonna
10:47 be productive
10:49 until a couple little things that we
10:50 need to have done here and there in the
10:52 end the people will decide your party is
10:54 is totally a globalist ik socialistic
10:59 coup on the country you're all gonna get
11:03 voted out of office and the party will
11:07 end and we will be one party centric not
11:12 left not right what's gonna take time
11:15 we're gonna write it in the history
11:17 books that you guys just screwed up but
11:19 if it's between that and getting
11:21 electrocuted to death at Gitmo or
11:23 getting hung or getting your head cut
11:24 off this is way better you can just fade
11:27 out into history you all will lose your
11:29 re-elections
11:31 and we move on there's others who don't
11:35 seem to research much but you get this
11:38 you know and I want to get these
11:39 responses it's sort of it's a real
11:43 letdown and it's not a letdown that you
11:45 don't believe what I believe at all
11:47 you can believe things completely
11:49 different than me I'm best friends with
11:51 people who believe things completely
11:52 different than me but when someone says
11:55 Oh Trump's just a puppet like everybody
11:57 else and you know Trump's a deep stator
11:59 and Trump's to this it really means that
12:02 you know nothing about the guy you've
12:05 done no research and this is a knee-jerk
12:08 response so that you can be lazy as [ __ ]
12:11 and not research anything I'm just gonna
12:13 give it to you straight
12:14 get off your lazy [ __ ] ass and study
12:17 the guy's entire history study his
12:19 family history study where he's been
12:21 study the progress of all of his
12:23 construction projects go study Bohemian
12:26 Grove go study the Council on Foreign
12:28 Relations trilateral commission the
12:30 Bilderberg Group look at all the
12:32 photographs that David estulin has come
12:35 up with for daniel estulin excuse me and
12:38 see if you can find Trump in the crowd
12:40 yes everyone wants to meet a guy worth
12:43 10 billion dollars who's a high-roller
12:45 who takes care of all of the Miss
12:48 America's Miss Universe guys got women
12:51 everywhere around him of course a bunch
12:53 of people want to be with them because
12:54 as well he's got money that he can
12:56 invest in your business from time to
12:58 time you know I also listen to Democrats
13:01 who say that if you ever start a
13:04 business that doesn't work that ends up
13:06 failing that you're a criminal for the
13:09 rest of your life and look at these
13:11 people and I think you have never
13:13 started a business in your life so maybe
13:15 she's shut the [ __ ] up
13:16 you know start 10 businesses and see if
13:19 all ten are successful but if eight
13:21 outer tenants are successful you would
13:24 think that you would brag that you're a
13:26 very successful person but according I
13:29 mean Trump's records better than eight
13:31 out of ten and they still give him [ __ ]
13:35 the same Democrats don't give a [ __ ]
13:37 about George Soros 679 corporations that
13:41 are tearing the world apart
13:43 a guy who sold his Jewish neighbors to
13:48 the Nazis at 15 cents a head and when I
13:51 tell family members of mine who were
13:53 Democrats though he's not old enough for
13:55 that
13:55 he's on audio admitting it get off your
13:58 lazy [ __ ] ass and do some research
13:59 right instead of researching nothing and
14:02 knowing everything get off your [ __ ]
14:04 lazy ass and go research something great
14:07 but what did the house do well Adam
14:12 Schiff quickly realize that if he was to
14:16 go through a normal impeachment process
14:18 there's something that has to take place
14:20 you have to make it a legal proceeding
14:23 what's a legal proceeding in the United
14:25 States of America well if you're going
14:27 to discuss charges against someone you
14:29 don't get to have this kangaroo court
14:31 when your lack of representation is
14:35 allowed that's what the Constitution's
14:37 for due process right we have a justice
14:41 system it's one of the best in the world
14:43 yes it is very flawed people can be
14:45 framed all the time the government you
14:47 know like Muller did his whole thing
14:50 where you know anybody who forgot what
14:52 they ordered you know at the the deli
14:55 the day before was considered a liar to
14:57 the FBI but the FBI as we will discuss
15:01 was one of the most corrupt
15:03 organizations ever so Adam Schiff in the
15:08 basement of the Capitol building
15:11 he first sets up the procedure he
15:16 rewrites the rules of this little
15:19 impeachment hearing that he has right he
15:21 decides you can come in and who can't
15:23 come in
15:23 none of trumps representation is allowed
15:26 in in fact none of the Republicans are
15:27 allowed in unless they have been brought
15:30 in through a subpoena to answer
15:32 questions America don't roll like that
15:35 mr. Schiff so he violates the very
15:40 example of the Constitution of the
15:42 United States now over on the side of
15:44 shift so shifts be in the you know the
15:48 boy touch her senator who is willing to
15:51 do anything to keep his record for
15:52 coming out right to his right is Pelosi
15:56 plus ease greatest crime course she's
15:59 the broad is going [ __ ] and saying on
16:02 camera I mean she's truly deep inside
16:05 the stages of dementia right and the
16:08 funny thing is is like she's a drunk
16:10 person trying to pretend to be sober and
16:12 I do think she's an alcoholic and I do
16:14 think she's been intoxicated or at least
16:16 on oxy cotton or something that makes
16:19 her look completely drunk out of her
16:22 mind but she you know when you're a liar
16:26 and a thief and you you have been
16:31 engaging in the most incredibly acidic
16:36 non-american backstabbing offense for
16:39 your entire career which is Nancy Pelosi
16:41 in a nutshell and then she gets to be
16:46 almost 80 years old and now she's
16:49 engaging in this pretend to be a tough
16:51 guy [ __ ] thing she can say whatever
16:53 the [ __ ] she says in her brain she's
16:55 like I can say whatever I say they buy
16:57 it they buy it it has worked for thirty
16:59 plus years I get why she thinks that for
17:04 her problem is that she doesn't get on
17:06 YouTube surprised to know how it works
17:09 the Great Awakening she has no clue cue
17:12 non-people she has no clue she has no
17:15 clue she is hanging on to these you know
17:18 these hipster snowflakes and that's not
17:21 all the hipsters but the history
17:22 snowflakes are a special subcategory
17:24 probably less than a couple percent of
17:26 all the hipsters who sit around you know
17:29 cheering her on and so as long as you
17:32 can find your little fanboy Club you
17:34 don't have to deal with reality and all
17:37 of these people either don't talk to
17:39 anyone which is most likely the case or
17:41 they're talking to their fan base it's
17:43 sort of like Tim Cook who always talks
17:45 to his own employees who simply wear the
17:48 Apple t-shirt at a Apple Store and he's
17:50 like are we doing all the right things
17:52 kids and they're like yeah you know and
17:54 then he's like okay we don't have to do
17:56 anything new for Apple you know let
17:59 stuff make that Mac Pro cost fifty two
18:01 thousand dollars when it's fully loaded
18:07 buying the new Mac Pro is like and
18:10 you test everyone's failing swear to god
18:13 it's like five and seven thousand
18:16 dollars a unit on the base configuration
18:18 which is such a crappy configuration
18:20 you'd never use it in that realm yeah
18:22 everybody wants $10,000 laptops right
18:24 now are our desktops at this point
18:26 insane but anyway plus he's talking
18:32 total gibberish her teeth are falling
18:35 out of her head it's a it's a
18:36 competition between her and Biden to see
18:38 how many words they can get out before
18:40 they're you know dentures fall out of
18:43 their face I mean what's the problem
18:44 holding dentures in my god I know people
18:47 have dentures and they never slide out
18:49 of their mouth it slides of the first
18:51 month you get them that's about it when
18:53 you're getting used to the whole thing
18:54 but they had these hearings I guess you
18:58 could call them it's sort of like a
18:59 little private party and imagine you
19:03 have been told now in this particular
19:06 cases in Pietschmann which would throw
19:08 Trump out of the presidency if I don't
19:10 want all the way through okay but what
19:12 if it's you and it's the difference
19:14 between you going to jail or going to
19:16 prison excuse me or not perhaps you're
19:20 already in prison and someone is perhaps
19:22 you haven't gone to prison yet and
19:23 they're trying to get your sentence all
19:25 the way up to maximum they want to kill
19:28 you because you know too much you too
19:30 lucid and they hold these kangaroo
19:33 courts you don't have any legal
19:36 representation so of course you're going
19:40 to be guilty it's Adam Schiff would be
19:43 judge and jury if he if he absolutely
19:46 could do it my friend who's the big
19:49 celebrity would be judge jury with no
19:52 information no crimes of any kind so
19:56 they voted on articles of impeachment
19:59 they approved them all and not a single
20:02 one as a crime they just have words that
20:05 sound like crimes but there's no crime
20:08 there's been no trial
20:10 there's been no discovery there's been
20:12 no jury there hasn't been a grand jury
20:15 there hasn't been a federal judge on
20:17 this thing it's all completely made up
20:20 out of thin air
20:22 meanwhile the basis of these fake
20:26 articles of impeachment are based on
20:28 fake events that never took place now
20:31 again if you've been under a rock this
20:33 episode is gonna be very helpful for you
20:36 or if you live overseas you know give a
20:37 [ __ ] about what America's whole thing is
20:39 and I don't blame you but obviously
20:43 struck and Paige she's an attorney he's
20:49 working inside the intelligence wings
20:52 slice of DOJ areas
20:54 he's influencing everything they're
20:57 texting back and forth about you know
20:59 how horrible Trump people are how
21:01 horrible Trump is and how there's an
21:03 insurance policy to make sure Trump
21:05 could never get into office if there
21:08 hasn't been a more treason istic
21:10 statement than that made public I don't
21:14 know what would trump that if someone
21:16 said here's a movie you got a right and
21:17 the first text is you know he'll never
21:21 be in office we have an insurance policy
21:24 well if you convert that into the
21:26 symbolistic metaphor what that means how
21:28 do you beat that besides she's maybe
21:30 curse words instead of normal words this
21:34 is a coup Obama's in on it too
21:38 Obama approved everything he approved
21:40 all the spying on the Trump
21:42 administration but how do you spy on a
21:44 candidate who hasn't been elected for
21:46 president I mean we do have you know a
21:49 warrant that has to be acquired in order
21:52 to spy on someone you have the
21:56 Democratic Party the DNC they know
22:00 they've got to get through a FISA Court
22:01 warrant and the FISA Court is a secret
22:04 court it's never supposed to be known by
22:07 mortal men right we're not supposed to
22:09 know what exists but it is the proxy to
22:12 all of the NSA data and it's a proxy to
22:15 doing live stream spying on someone's
22:19 phone calls on their emails on their
22:21 text messages I mean everything right
22:23 you have to get permission and that's
22:26 that's a good sign that that actually
22:28 had to occur but the FISA Court is the
22:30 most advanced court in the nation you
22:34 got to really convince
22:36 judge of something some motive in order
22:40 to get the judge to allow you to spy on
22:43 another human being especially Donald
22:46 Trump a billionaire never he would have
22:49 Trump liquidated a billion dollars worth
22:51 of his money cash and said I'm gonna
22:54 fight you until you're all in jail I'm
22:58 gonna hire as many law firms as it takes
23:00 I'm gonna hire one law firm for each one
23:02 of the cases against each one of you
23:05 traitors now you should be able to use
23:08 tax dollars at this point and hopefully
23:10 that's what Attorney General bar is
23:12 doing but they came up with that dossier
23:15 right what's this thing about the
23:18 dossier well they don't want to tell you
23:20 or remind you what's in the damn thing
23:22 because it is so [ __ ] stupid that it
23:26 it just you can't really talk about the
23:29 dossier unless you're 18 and over in the
23:32 room you can't but I'm gonna talk about
23:36 it here be interesting if this video
23:38 gets like knocked at shouldn't because I
23:40 watch videos all the time with this
23:42 material in it they had this guy some
23:48 former unemployed British spy which is
23:53 interesting because you're never
23:54 supposed to really be out of the job
23:56 right it's steel is his name that's why
24:00 we call it the steel dossier he just
24:03 runs off and writes a whole thing about
24:05 Donald Trump that's completely fictional
24:08 they've admitted it's all fictional guy
24:11 had and what they did was this okay so
24:14 they wrote something completely
24:15 fictional and a lot of its based on
24:16 things that you know Donald Trump or
24:21 excuse me um Bill Clinton is done and it
24:25 has to do with seeing prostitutes in
24:27 Russia we've got a picture from the
24:30 Russian intelligence when the KGB of
24:33 Clinton sitting on the end of the bed
24:35 with a beautiful prostitute in lingerie
24:38 not naked yet he's totally naked you
24:42 know he just got some strange on the
24:44 side okay man if I was married to
24:45 Hillary
24:46 you couldn't force me no sex with that
24:48 woman and she probably wouldn't want to
24:50 anyway
24:50 I'm not reptile enough but they knew
24:54 that they had Hillary Clinton was
24:59 running against him so this is what
25:00 motivates a lot of the still dossiers
25:02 Bill Clinton attachments which is they
25:06 know they've got problems with bill
25:08 bills a rapists bills you know been to
25:12 Epstein's Island over 25 times left
25:14 behind the Secret Service at least five
25:16 times she's been there six times left
25:18 behind the Secret Service one time it's
25:20 a complete sex island with kids man so
25:24 there's all kinds of you know hearsay
25:30 that bills done a lot of really bad
25:32 things oh I'm sure they covered up the
25:35 tracks you know Hugh says they have all
25:37 that information but I don't buy it
25:39 I don't buy it for a second he can he
25:42 can say they do but I don't think they
25:44 do but you know Anthony Weiner the the
25:50 husband of uma Abidine uma Abidine who
25:53 is the best friend of Hillary Clinton
25:55 and potentially lover which I have no
25:57 problem with but he got busted with his
26:00 computer he had 650,000 emails and a
26:03 folder on her called
26:04 insurance policy and inside that folder
26:07 has all kinds of nasty [ __ ] and as a
26:10 bunch of rumors about what's in it but
26:12 let's go back to the steal dossier
26:15 because the steal does he says the
26:17 Donald Trump was in a Russian hotel okay
26:20 this is a guy that sleeps with
26:21 supermodels and marries them and his
26:23 children with them so not so sure he
26:29 needs to go get you know something out
26:31 of Russia but maybe but they say that he
26:34 was in this hotel and that he was he was
26:37 in two golden showers if you will okay
26:41 not sure where there would be a crime in
26:43 that but that's the photographic
26:47 evidence we have of Bill Clinton
26:50 remember why is this attached to Bill
26:53 Clinton because Hillary is married to
26:55 that dude and you could just drag her
26:57 down by announcing
26:59 and reminding people of what bill has
27:01 done and even though no one in America
27:05 would ever sleep with Hillary Clinton
27:06 and that we probably all have a little
27:09 bonus sympathy for Bill wanting to go
27:11 someplace else for sex you know and
27:14 quite frankly I don't care bill sleeps
27:16 with the prostitute I don't want him
27:17 sleeping with a 13 year old kid that's
27:20 what happens at Epstein's island that's
27:22 what the island is all about is illegal
27:24 sex so again Trump has been accused of
27:27 all kinds of underage sex and all kinds
27:30 of stuff he went to every single one of
27:32 those cases who said I'm ready bring it
27:34 into court because discovery is gonna
27:36 happen which means you got to prove
27:38 you're into the bargain and I gotta
27:39 prove mine and every single one of them
27:42 canceled there was no settlement right
27:45 just cancel it now the store be Daniel's
27:48 thing not quite sure well you know what
27:51 she did but she finally announced that
27:52 her affair with Trump was completely
27:55 drummed up as well never get spreaded in
27:57 the press because they want you to
27:59 remember that it was real and that
28:01 somehow she got paid off by somebody in
28:04 her line of work she could sleep with a
28:06 bunch of powerful people and the fact
28:09 she's still alive is amazing it's it
28:12 actually it actually shows that that
28:14 side of the fence doesn't default to
28:17 killing everyone every time someone you
28:18 know like Seth rich pisses them off
28:20 right but obviously they had this
28:23 cluding with a Russian thing and you
28:24 still hear it from the Republicans today
28:26 well there's no doubt that the Russians
28:28 you know meddle with our elections I'm
28:32 still waiting for someone to tell me how
28:34 that happened well okay they've meddled
28:37 okay how did they metal the amount of
28:39 ads they bought on Facebook started off
28:42 in the hundreds of thousands of dollars
28:44 actually they get started the millions
28:45 then 100 thousands then with the tens of
28:48 thousands and then I think it dropped
28:49 under $10,000 so raise your hand if you
28:53 were going to vote for Hillary and you
28:56 saw a ad on Facebook that linked to some
29:00 page and then all of a sudden you saw
29:02 maybe something real maybe something
29:04 fake and then you voted for Trump I mean
29:06 seriously I don't know any human being
29:08 on earth that switch their views not
29:11 because of Trump sad
29:12 not because of her ads you were
29:14 pre-decided given that most of Hillary
29:17 Clinton's voters are either dead or the
29:20 same person voting in 50,000 times we
29:23 understand that algorithm it slowed down
29:27 a little bit but since the election of
29:30 Donald Trump
29:31 I have personally read an article about
29:32 every month to month and a half of
29:34 someone going to jail for voter fraud
29:38 during the 2016 presidential election
29:40 and the charges have always been
29:43 throwing votes for Hillary Clinton
29:46 against Trump so they're still cleaning
29:50 up that mess but they don't want to road
29:52 your sense of security in the vote now
29:56 when perhaps they come around with the
29:59 voter ID which i think is going to
30:01 happen next year they're gonna drag all
30:04 this out to make sure that you
30:05 understand there needs to be some
30:07 identification process here in Orange
30:09 County California
30:10 I watched you know illegal immigrants
30:13 bring in voter like a grandfather type
30:17 character who know speaking English
30:19 votes they won't take his ID they don't
30:22 want it right I got mine out she's all I
30:24 don't want that I got that on video by
30:25 the way and all they have to do is take
30:30 that guy to every other voting booth in
30:31 the area just play that whole sob story
30:33 this is his first time voting and it uh
30:37 all right kind of nice when you have to
30:41 show your ID right you don't get caught
30:43 by anybody but California hands them out
30:47 now to everybody so it's no big deal
30:49 nowadays but the Creed is still dossier
30:53 and it's just packed full of stuff it's
30:55 all fictional when they get caught with
30:58 all this fake accusations towards Trump
31:00 and they try to you know nail every
31:03 single meeting they lied about people
31:04 meeting each other they would stage a
31:07 meeting were imagine me saying to you
31:09 hey um why don't you meet me in the
31:12 backyard here and we'll do an episode
31:13 together and you're like awesome and I
31:15 say just the two of us right yeah yeah
31:17 yeah and so you come back here and I got
31:21 the spirit cook milady back here the bra
31:24 Voinovich or whatever the [ __ ] her name
31:26 Marina Abramovic whatever name is total
31:29 Satanist woman here right and then you
31:32 said you know maybe you don't know or
31:34 maybe maybe the chair is empty and
31:35 there's two extra chairs and you sit
31:37 down I start filming and she comes out
31:39 and sits down you don't recognize her
31:42 maybe you don't know who she is then
31:44 eventually someone taps you on the
31:45 shoulder when the episode airs do you
31:47 know that lady is that's a satan lady
31:49 are you a Satanist
31:50 yeah no no God I'm not a Satanist and
31:53 then you're like your friends are like
31:54 yeah sure you're sure but they tried to
31:59 set up Kushner his son-in-law they try
32:01 to set up Donald jr. where they create
32:04 these meetings they invite people in
32:06 people walk in the room some people
32:08 never showed up but they said they did
32:11 unbelievable now because none of that's
32:15 provable right
32:16 the dossier has been erased and what
32:19 they did to try and backfill its lack of
32:22 credibility is to create a back story
32:25 that is still bad because they can't
32:28 produce any proof they say that this
32:30 they say this steel guy you know had a
32:34 couple drunk conversations with people
32:37 it's a way to go okay we need to walk
32:39 away from this thing then they had this
32:42 phone call right this is where it gets
32:45 un-fuckin'-believable man Joe Biden the
32:49 pedophile child touch her just look up
32:51 his c-span groping of children's breasts
32:56 I mean we're talking about kids under 10
32:58 on camera squeezing your girl's breasts
33:00 with his right hand to the point she
33:02 flicks his hand away adjusting his junk
33:06 in his pants for a swearing-in of this
33:08 guy and the daughter wants to be on the
33:11 other side of her father and he
33:12 violently grabs her arm and pulls her
33:14 over and tries to put her arm on his
33:17 junk while he's doing the swearing in
33:20 thing and she holds her arm away from
33:21 his crotch the guy I swear to god I'll
33:25 just let the Hells Angels take care of
33:27 that guy one day either the ones that
33:29 are on earth are the ones that are up
33:31 there right but this guy is part of the
33:35 Council on Foreign Relations and talks
33:37 about straight up bright
33:39 and extortion quid pro quo with an
33:42 attorney an investigator who was
33:44 investigating his son hunter Biden for
33:48 corruption in the Ukraine he gets he
33:51 holds back a billion dollars he's this
33:53 is he sir his words man and he said that
33:56 you're not gonna get the billion unless
33:58 you get one of this guys investigating
34:00 my son well obviously you don't need to
34:02 get rid of an investigator if your son's
34:04 not committing a crime go ahead and look
34:05 into my son he's perfectly fine but he
34:08 knows his son was up to no good
34:10 would probably have been found guilty on
34:12 something and potentially go to jail in
34:14 the Ukraine or at least destroy his
34:17 whole career and so he held back the
34:19 money they fired the prosecutor and then
34:23 the money was released the exact same
34:26 thing they're accusing Trump of but
34:29 Trump released the transcript everybody
34:32 was on the call for real comes and shows
34:34 up to this hearing in this basement with
34:38 these lunatics and says there was no
34:40 quid pro quo the fact he made it
34:42 explicitly clear in words without
34:44 beating around the bush no quid pro quo
34:47 right no one's ever gonna want to hear
34:49 that phrase again right okay well geez
34:54 the Democrats now have a huge problem
34:57 they take they keep telling their Lunik
34:59 lunatic fringe individuals this little
35:03 tiny less than 1% of the American
35:05 population that Trump has committed all
35:08 these crimes and of course one of them
35:09 is my acquaintance acting friend in LA
35:15 they don't need to know any evidence
35:18 they just want to hate someone because
35:21 in the end they hate themselves right as
35:23 I always say if you're happy and you
35:25 know it man you don't run around trying
35:27 to hate other people if anything you
35:29 become a diffuser you go into situations
35:31 where people having arguments and you
35:33 you're kind of like what can we can we
35:35 in this right now like what do you need
35:37 what do you need why you guys arguing
35:39 did you guys used to be friends again
35:42 everyone loves Trump until he ran for
35:43 president so now imagine
35:48 you know this is the way this is the way
35:51 it really is what I'm about to give you
35:53 is an analogy of exactly what's
35:55 happening in the House of
35:56 Representatives people that have the
35:58 starting salary of a hundred and forty
36:00 seven thousand dollars a year starting
36:02 south that's what a OC makes from
36:05 bartending to being a House
36:07 Representative frame doesn't know what a
36:09 garbage disposal is might be
36:12 categorically one of the most ignorant
36:14 human beings I've ever seen sit in front
36:17 of a camera the only thing she is fairly
36:20 good at is manipulating people's
36:28 responses to very manipulative
36:31 conversation or questions actually that
36:34 she poses to them to try and entrap them
36:36 like she's been trained and entrapping
36:38 that's that seems to be her primary
36:41 skill set at this point but now you know
36:44 we have things that are called crimes
36:46 there's a whole book there are the
36:48 crimes that are federal crimes and
36:50 there's a book which are the state
36:52 crimes of the state that you live in and
36:54 a lot of states share the state crimes
36:57 all right so if you kill someone the
37:02 crime is typically called homicide or
37:05 murder and there's different degrees of
37:07 murder based on the circumstances of why
37:09 you did it
37:10 why someone did it right if you steal
37:13 from someone yeah based on what you
37:15 steal it's petty theft or it's grand
37:18 theft auto or its racketeering there's
37:23 all kinds of levels of all crimes they
37:25 have names okay so these articles of
37:28 impeachment need to have crimes in them
37:34 okay now there's there's technicalities
37:37 and this is sort of what they're relying
37:40 on at this point to get around the
37:42 actual crime accusation but again what
37:46 if someone charged you at a thinner
37:49 you've been a good citizen your whole
37:51 life you're not perfect but you know you
37:52 never killed anybody never stolen
37:53 anything at least I was an adult and you
37:57 know you're good
37:59 okay someone knocks on your door the
38:03 federal marshal yeah a [ __ ] potato
38:06 head guy Nadler is right behind him
38:08 right maybe he's wearing his Boy Scout
38:11 outfit and they say you're under arrest
38:16 I need you to come out with your hands
38:19 up and then they take one hand and lock
38:23 it in a handcuff and the other hand and
38:25 they lock your wrists and you're just
38:27 tied up and they throw you in a paddy
38:29 wagon and then you go for your you know
38:33 your hearing in front of the judge where
38:37 he's going to tell you what you're
38:38 charged with of course they're gonna
38:39 tell you into your face which you're
38:40 charged with and here's what they say
38:42 they don't say anything that's a real
38:45 crime what they say is mr. Nadler here
38:48 has told me that you're a poopoo head a
38:50 dodo mouth and that you have cooties you
38:54 have the worst case of cooties ever at a
38:58 bunch of other made-up crap and you're
39:01 like is this real I mean is this am I
39:04 being Punk'd is this real
39:06 I hear about really having cuffs on
39:09 right now ooh
39:10 Wow sitting in a a what is it a
39:15 fiberglass chair in the back of a cop
39:18 car they're not made of leather man
39:20 they're hard as a rock I had to identify
39:23 a guy who shot a bunch of rounds out of
39:26 a pistol in a parking lot ones that
39:29 wasn't fun but just being a passenger in
39:33 the back of a cop car was uncomfortable
39:35 man and that's without handcuffs on that
39:38 being you know high and out of my mind
39:40 or something right I've never been
39:42 arrested not even close but they arrest
39:46 you on all these crazy weird phrase
39:50 ologies that aren't crimes and you're
39:52 just like what the [ __ ] is going on here
39:55 what is it am I not in America that I
39:57 just transitioned to pollute the world
40:00 am I dreaming and that's what these
40:02 articles of impeachment are they have
40:05 simply made up almost like a word game
40:09 these violations of
40:12 nothing no crimes committed whatsoever
40:16 because if they were to say in an
40:19 article of impeachment that he committed
40:22 a crime then he has to get a trial he
40:26 has to get due process he has to get it
40:29 expediently done and he's got some
40:33 pretty goddamn good attorneys and so
40:35 they know they would lose so they avoid
40:38 legitimate claims of crimes and they
40:41 simply make it up and you know why they
40:43 make it up because the people that
40:45 follow these lunatics which I don't
40:47 think are very many but these people who
40:50 follow these lunatics are even stupider
40:54 than the individuals that are coming up
40:56 with this crap and that almost boggles
40:58 the mind doesn't it had they not spent
41:02 the last 30 years destroying the
41:05 education system in America and they
41:08 tried this I don't know I don't know
41:12 what would happen would they all be
41:13 arrested probably I mean we'd all be
41:16 like everyone's gone insane someone has
41:18 attacked the brains with some weird
41:20 virus some fringe division virus all
41:26 these individuals they're going nuts it
41:30 honestly would make a lot more sense
41:31 than anything else that's being
41:32 suggested right when you're Pelosi talk
41:35 oh my god that is one slice of crazy
41:38 you've watched 12 monkeys with Brad Pitt
41:41 it's like Pelosi could literally be cut
41:44 into that movie and you would not doubt
41:47 that she was a character in that movie
41:50 in the padded rooms the funny farm thing
41:53 just insane the whole thing with Trump
41:58 hey I heard two girls talking today at
42:02 chick-fil-a which is usually a fairly
42:05 conservative place you know it was funny
42:07 chick-fil-a got raked over the coals
42:11 because they weren't there just a place
42:14 that serves chicken sandwiches man but
42:16 all of a sudden they have to support
42:17 LGBT dude it's like hey man this ain't
42:19 Apple right we're Tim Cook turns the
42:21 entire company into his personal sexual
42:24 orientation fly
42:26 I mean you know it's like it's the most
42:27 crazy thing now the corporations have
42:29 personal personalities right it's just
42:33 so weird just make computers better make
42:36 phones better make software better don't
42:39 worry about whether or not as someone is
42:40 straight or gay that is their personal
42:42 journey that is not your business Apple
42:45 but all these people attacked
42:47 chick-fil-a then they come out they say
42:49 okay well we're not really trying to
42:51 take a position either way it's okay
42:54 let's take a position we have no problem
42:57 with LGBT then the LGBT crowd goes yeah
43:00 you're not telling the truth [ __ ] you
43:02 and then the religious right say what
43:06 you're supporting LGBT [ __ ] you and so
43:09 now they can't win but the restaurants
43:11 are packed every single day and I mean
43:12 packed and they're full service men you
43:15 sit at the table you use the app you
43:18 order you tell you scan this little chip
43:20 on the table they bring the food
43:21 straight to you never stand in line and
43:23 every three sandwiches you get one for
43:26 free that's pretty awesome right there's
43:28 your little plug but these two girls are
43:31 talking and one of us from England and
43:33 one of them America and I can't tell
43:36 where their position is because the girl
43:38 was you know basically defending the
43:43 fact that the impeachment [ __ ] and
43:45 you can't just a peach a guy because you
43:47 don't like him
43:47 which was strange I mean which was good
43:49 to hear but it the way she was talking
43:51 was in questions she was talking like
43:54 this and you know like that like this
43:57 and it was like oh wow so you've managed
44:01 to completely learn English incorrectly
44:04 right you're emphasizing every statement
44:07 with a with a question inflection at the
44:09 end as if whatever you're saying is so
44:13 profound you need to make sure we can
44:15 understand everything that you're saying
44:17 it was really strange but even this girl
44:21 she was like you know she explains this
44:25 to her friend that she didn't like the
44:27 way Trump behaves but she's like that
44:30 doesn't mean you can impeach the guy and
44:31 she seemed to agree that he acts like an
44:34 ass in her opinion hey whatever her
44:37 opinion
44:38 but she also recapped the California gas
44:41 tax because everybody thought the gas
44:43 tax was going to be a gas tax at the
44:45 pump it's not a gas tax at the pump it's
44:48 a gas tax on your registration on your
44:51 car so the way it works in California is
44:55 if your registration was five hundred
44:57 dollars you have a five-year loan it'll
44:59 go down to about four hundred the next
45:00 year
45:01 maybe and some change and then three
45:03 hundred and some change and then two
45:04 hundred and it usually locks in around
45:06 100 bucks somewhere in there 80 to 100
45:09 bucks with this gas tax it all went up
45:11 higher depending on what kind of car you
45:14 and obviously if you in the hybrid it's
45:16 a lot lower if you own a full electric
45:17 is probably even lower net yours truly
45:20 drawl Charlie drives the car with gas
45:23 but then my engine shuts off her time I
45:25 stopped so that helps out but I've had
45:28 my car for three years and willing out
45:30 thirty five thousand miles I'm not even
45:31 driving that much but of course I'll get
45:35 taxed as if I've got three hundred
45:36 thousand miles on the car so the
45:39 impeachment articles are gonna go to the
45:41 house are start gonna go to the Senate
45:42 excuse me and they're gonna get shot
45:44 down immediately
45:46 it'll be over the Democrats have no
45:48 viable candidates the one and they run
45:53 these polls they run these polls that
45:55 are insane over here in America right
45:57 they just make up the numbers and throw
45:59 them out to see if that'll sway opinion
46:02 and so they've told us that every single
46:06 candidate like they've told us that
46:08 Elizabeth Warren was number one and
46:10 other than her multitrillion-dollar
46:12 health care plan she really didn't take
46:16 any hits right she takes hits all of
46:19 them take hits when Trump goes on a
46:21 stomp and shows up at some arena has
46:24 twenty to thirty thousand people inside
46:26 with ten to twenty thousand people
46:28 waiting outside to get in that's when
46:30 they all suffer then they lately they're
46:34 telling us that Biden is number one but
46:36 Biden is making huge faux pause in
46:39 public right
46:39 no malarkey is his [ __ ] campaign
46:43 slogan no malarkey oh okay and he says
46:47 he's he's hip he's a hip cat he knows
46:49 what what kids you know
46:51 our thinking these days inside dude amen
46:55 I have big respect for the the ancient
46:58 past of America but I don't remember the
47:01 decade I'm pretty sure malarkey was used
47:03 probably in my grandfather's era when he
47:06 was in his 20s right Milwaukee see but
47:11 now we find out that all these folks
47:15 went to the Ukraine looking for dirt on
47:17 Trump both before he became president
47:19 and after he became president they're
47:22 obstructing justice according to their
47:24 own terms right because if Trump calls
47:27 up the other guy and says hey I heard
47:28 you're running on a platform you got
47:30 elected on the platform of removing
47:32 corruption and in the Ukraine yep yep
47:34 yep okay well we've got this weird thing
47:36 over here that Joe Biden actually had an
47:40 investigator fired and held back a
47:42 billion dollars could you please look
47:44 into that and one of that what is the
47:46 house really saying with the impeachment
47:48 you're not allowed to look into our
47:50 crimes we are deep Staters we are in
47:53 charge we live above the law and you
47:58 don't get to look at our stuff so now we
48:01 have this list of people that is so long
48:07 at this point who are potentially going
48:10 to go to jail AG bar flat said in an
48:14 interview just the other day when they
48:16 asked him about arresting all these
48:18 individuals he said these things take
48:21 time and then he laughed this really
48:23 informed laughs it was great they know
48:27 they can't just like bump off everyone
48:29 because someone else will come in his
48:30 shoes and even throw down harder now we
48:34 have to be ready and I talked about this
48:36 every once in a while but it's important
48:38 it is just my hunch okay
48:42 that they are scheming every single day
48:44 to try and find a weakness and Trump's
48:47 travel plans and wherever he is to shoot
48:51 him because they can they can find
48:54 plenty of their deranged crazy folks to
48:58 pull the trigger and go to jail forever
49:01 they can
49:04 and so I don't know how they run the
49:05 security on these facilities that he
49:08 speaks at but I hope that that the curve
49:11 of inspection is going up and not down
49:15 right don't get confident in these
49:17 places you know and your ability to make
49:21 sure that you know there's no one in the
49:24 place with metal that there's no one
49:25 outside doing crazy [ __ ] Oh for that
49:27 hopefully the building is just
49:28 absolutely littered with you know Secret
49:31 Service folks and other military
49:33 individuals ready to stop whatever might
49:36 occur but they're gonna try most likely
49:38 again they tried to kill him on a golf
49:40 course in Scotland his golf course a guy
49:43 parachuted in and shot and killed a
49:46 Secret Service agent but they don't want
49:49 us to know that that got close but
49:53 that's what happened so dude already
49:55 laid down his life for the President and
49:57 hopefully we don't let that death go in
50:00 vain I feel for my friends who are
50:03 Democrats because their party is being
50:05 destroyed by these absolute crazy people
50:08 it is now going to be once again a
50:11 heinous thing to see your democrat in
50:14 this country especially if Trump gets
50:17 another four years to clean this place
50:18 up
50:19 could you imagine following up his plan
50:23 or his deeds after eight years the
50:26 economy's just booming we're able to
50:30 lower taxes because we're bringing in
50:32 billions if not trillions of dollars in
50:34 both tariffs and the United Nations and
50:38 NATO finally paying their own bill we
50:41 get back all this money we no longer pay
50:43 Obama's you know policy to Iran giving
50:47 away five hundred billion dollars every
50:51 single year for I don't know how many
50:52 years it was it was gonna be trillions
50:54 of dollars like three trillion dollars
50:55 or something we're gonna deliver and
50:57 pallets of cash that comes out of your
51:01 savings that comes out of your earnings
51:03 that goes out of your taxes your kids
51:05 you know struggling to pay for a student
51:09 loan but Obama gave away enough money to
51:13 flatline every student loan in this
51:16 country
51:17 in one shipment mm-hmm no he was a
51:21 well-spoken man wasn't he I love when I
51:24 hear that big compliment to him bhai
51:27 just loved the way you know Obama's read
51:31 a teleprompter couldn't really talk
51:35 anything other than maybe like James
51:38 Kirk back in Star Trek in 1967
51:41 you know meanwhile Trump could talk for
51:44 an hour off script and they has the
51:47 whole place in the palm of his hands
51:49 Trump talks to us the way that we talk
51:52 to each other and supposedly that's
51:54 unpresidential all right but then you
51:58 listen to all these nut bags in the
52:00 house you know it used to be that if you
52:04 had a rally or some sort of meeting and
52:06 you were of the opposition party you
52:10 might get a protestor in the room that
52:11 stands up just like Schiff got his ass
52:13 handed to him and Biden's had his ass
52:14 handed to him several times recently
52:16 where they stand up and say you're a
52:18 criminal you're the guilty one you're
52:21 going to jail but we actually have at
52:25 least the the one house lady I forget
52:28 her name she's under investigation for
52:30 campaign finance irregularities which
52:33 means crime so is AOC you know Marv just
52:38 marries her brother and brings him over
52:40 illegally I mean these are really these
52:43 are really great a people that we put in
52:45 the house man Feinstein who's 85 years
52:48 old she looks like Tales from the Crypt
52:50 sitting there listening to [ __ ] it's
52:53 time to move on like why are you still
52:56 there seriously go take a poop retire
53:00 and spend some time with your kids for
53:02 God's sakes but just think about the if
53:05 your if your whole life is sitting in
53:08 meetings in a leather chair staring at a
53:12 piece of paper with a pin and you're not
53:15 affecting anything you're not really
53:16 doing anything profound besides selling
53:18 out your state to agenda21 right that's
53:22 what a California has turned into it's
53:24 turned into a dinner 21 its or tax to
53:28 death in this state
53:30 you can't start a business very easily
53:31 and if you do my god you better you
53:35 better close your business the second
53:37 you don't have any money you better file
53:38 your taxes you better only save a
53:40 reservoir to file your taxes and close
53:42 your corporations because the second you
53:44 don't close it and you don't have any
53:46 money to close it because you have to
53:47 file all your taxes and do all this you
53:50 know processing to get it closed if you
53:52 literally have someone like I had a guy
53:54 screw me eighty thousand dollars my last
53:58 client at zero g my king company he
54:02 screwed me 80 grand he finally made up
54:05 20 but that didn't cover the bills to
54:08 close the thing down because my my bills
54:11 to my employees one guy was Oh $27,000 I
54:15 owed you know about 55 grand out the
54:18 door just to close the place after the
54:19 eighty and the guy walked away how
54:24 people do that blows me away man pray
54:26 there's no God it's all I gotta see but
54:30 now there's that old adage okay when it
54:35 comes to the Border Patrol prior to
54:37 Trump when it comes to welfare programs
54:40 prior to Trump when it comes to foreign
54:44 policy before Trump we kept doing the
54:48 same thing expecting a change in the
54:51 positive when every single year that we
54:53 did the same thing think agenda 21
54:56 agenda 21 1 right the TPP Excalibur
55:02 sword you know falling out of space
55:04 stabbing America right through the heart
55:07 that's what TPP would have been and
55:09 Trump went whoa what is it what are you
55:11 talking about
55:12 no I don't think so does anybody know
55:15 anything about business in this place
55:16 right the one thing the girl said it at
55:20 chick-fil-a and this is just something
55:22 you hear all the time and it's so funny
55:27 they will call Trump an idiot and I just
55:31 think that that statement is utterly
55:33 hilarious because the difference between
55:36 Donald Trump's success and their success
55:40 is is like comparing the Empire State
55:44 Building to an ether a particle okay
55:46 that's the magnitude difference between
55:50 their lives and his life
55:51 when you run on top you don't have to
55:54 kiss anybody's ass and remember I always
55:56 talk about the Freud factor you got your
55:58 persona and your character well I think
56:00 when you learn that in psychology class
56:03 in junior college or your first year of
56:05 normal college you have this instinctual
56:08 thought of like and that kind of sucks
56:10 isn't it that we have this pretend
56:12 person and then we have a real person we
56:16 want to be the real person that we are
56:19 John Lennon was a real person he didn't
56:23 have a persona you know after a while
56:26 you know when he was really really young
56:28 in the early 60s when the band was
56:29 blowing up he just kept his mouth shut
56:32 so he wouldn't have to kiss someone's
56:34 ass that's why he's the quietest guy in
56:37 most of the interviews via time he hit
56:40 the 70s he was going after the CIA the
56:43 whole time who had him shot he was
56:46 himself he was known for being very for
56:50 the snowflakes of the world rude
56:52 who else idolized John Lennon who was
56:56 like John Lennon Steve Jobs Steve Jobs
57:01 was intense man he would tell you
57:03 exactly how he felt now he needed to
57:05 mature and he would be the first person
57:07 to tell you yeah you know I had a real
57:09 antiquated view of LGBT when I was young
57:12 and as I got older I realized that was
57:14 just me being stupid and young okay so
57:17 everybody's got their flaws when they're
57:19 young but you know most of us fix it
57:21 when we get older so Donald Trump having
57:24 been successful in one of the toughest
57:28 towns this country has ever created ever
57:33 okay he lived in New York when it was
57:36 bad okay
57:38 and he still developed a place to an
57:42 incredible level now all of his business
57:45 is successful of course not
57:47 okay the only way you could have one oil
57:50 have a business as successful is to have
57:52 one business
57:53 and never take your eyes off the thing
57:55 but the second you try to diversify
57:57 because you want to do casinos you want
57:59 to do Miss America you want to start a
58:01 school you know he can't be in all
58:03 places at all times and so he hires the
58:07 best possible people he can but
58:10 sometimes people deceive you with their
58:12 resumes and sometimes people are just
58:19 inadequate they just thought they could
58:20 and they can't
58:21 and so they crash and burn he's got to
58:24 make decisions on my god hurt my school
58:26 it's not making people happy and I'm
58:29 gonna have to do some refunds well can
58:32 you no tell me what's going on here well
58:33 you know some of these people are
58:34 suspect but some of these people are
58:36 probably pretty legit not everyone's
58:37 always satisfied with anything right if
58:40 you made t-shirts basic t-shirts
58:43 something you can't get wrong right
58:47 someone's gonna get the t-shirt not like
58:49 it because they got fat it doesn't fit
58:51 them right you know it's your fault they
58:53 gained weight I was raised by men who
58:58 weren't terribly refined in that realm
59:02 but I would much prefer to have been
59:06 raised by those men than to be raised by
59:09 a bunch of guys who are pretending to be
59:11 something that they're not because as an
59:14 adult I can add those dimensions later
59:16 in life that you know one thing that's
59:19 very interesting that I experienced
59:22 which relates to Donald Trump's behavior
59:24 is that when I worked as simply an
59:27 employee when I was in the e bracket of
59:29 the cash quadrant that Robert Kiyosaki
59:31 wrote you know you dealt with all the
59:36 managers you know putting on a happy
59:38 face and every time the CEO talked they
59:40 put on the happy face and you know we
59:42 have these parties and they're trying to
59:43 keep us all you know in a vision and
59:45 keep us all happy but as I moved up in
59:48 the world and became an S and then B and
59:51 then dealt with the eyes to get the B
59:54 rolling right the investors to get my
59:56 businesses going and I started meeting
59:58 these guys behind the curtain going to
60:01 the bel-air Country Club over and over
60:03 and over to talk to these guys well
60:06 they're very sweet
60:07 they're very nice people but when it
60:09 comes to taking their money out of their
60:11 wallet brace yourself brace yourself man
60:16 if you think the shark tank can get a
60:17 little intense
60:18 holy [ __ ] you've never seen a real
60:20 investor look at a prospectus as to
60:23 whether or not they should give up their
60:25 hard-earned money because a lot of these
60:27 guys this is with everyone they will
60:30 have made their money in a decade or two
60:32 before you talk to them the opportunity
60:35 that they had to make that money is no
60:37 longer on planet Earth and so they know
60:39 they must be very wise with their money
60:41 if they want to give it to some of their
60:43 children or if they want to you know use
60:45 it for their own purposes and so when
60:47 you're like give me a million dollars
60:49 you know they're like what you know
60:52 that's not the way you ask for it you
60:55 know I've never said this but this is
60:58 the way it rolls you're not asking an
61:00 investor for the money
61:01 that's not the way the formula goes in
61:04 the conversation but that's how every
61:05 novice comes to an investor what you are
61:08 doing with an investor is telling them
61:10 how much money you're gonna give them
61:13 you just happen to need their capital to
61:18 finance some events some invention some
61:20 service some product that will then sell
61:22 that will facilitate this commitment to
61:26 giving them the money that they want to
61:28 hear they're not there to give you their
61:29 money they're here to make money off of
61:31 you and that's the conversational faux
61:34 pas that happens a lot if some of these
61:37 guys are great and some of these guys
61:38 can be [ __ ] but I tell you what
61:41 here's the difference between dealing
61:43 with an investor who's you know all
61:45 sunshine now some of you have been
61:48 blessed to have people just write your
61:50 checks I know a couple friends of mine
61:52 that asked for $100,000 and they were
61:55 given three in a check within five
61:56 minutes and then poof their company
61:58 starts and they've had it for twenty
61:59 thirty years so that happens every once
62:02 in a while but you can't rely on that
62:04 kind of behavior but the investor that
62:06 is SuperDuper nice to you will drag on
62:09 your investment cycle and never give you
62:12 any money but you will have thought they
62:14 were going to give you the money the
62:16 investor who's a little bit cantankerous
62:19 and not convinced that you have a real
62:22 business model and they're poking holes
62:24 in it left and right you have to
62:27 understand that most of them are if they
62:28 come back the second day they're
62:30 interested they really do believe in
62:32 what you're doing but they may not be
62:34 all sunshine because they don't see
62:36 you're really connecting the dots so
62:37 it's better to know that you have a very
62:43 slim chance of getting them to commit
62:44 that if therefore you go home and you
62:46 rework your business model such that it
62:48 does make sense on paper you do have
62:50 real connections you've done your due
62:52 diligence on your competition etc etc so
62:54 when you get a positive response from
62:56 them you really earned it and you know
62:58 you're actually measurably closer to
62:59 getting the money so for better for
63:02 worse you know this country is it's you
63:07 know we're still waiting for the job
63:10 market to approach a lot of folks we
63:12 still have a lot of unemployed people so
63:14 that's still catching up but a lot of
63:18 people who are unemployed are now
63:20 employed you know we have record
63:22 employment in this country we are
63:25 bringing in tons of money and we're
63:26 bringing in so much money through
63:28 Chinese tariffs and through NATO and UN
63:30 payments and a lot of other cost-cutting
63:33 exercises deregulating a bunch of crap
63:35 regulations create Rioch bureaucracy and
63:40 jobs right so one of the methods the
63:43 government's used to invent jobs is to
63:46 create regulations
63:47 remember the Maytag guy who was employed
63:50 just to sit there and he never did any
63:53 think as Maytag stuff never broke down
63:55 ok well that guy was employed in case it
63:58 did so when they wanted to regulate for
64:02 instance this is one of the cheesiest
64:05 things I've ever heard the Trump accused
64:07 of he comes in and he looks at all this
64:10 crap that these both the right and the
64:13 left have come up with over the years to
64:16 create these these unnecessary jobs we
64:19 had a whole division that was
64:22 duplicating all of the anti-poaching
64:24 efforts in Africa for things like
64:27 elephant ivory
64:29 was at rhino horns and all these other
64:31 things that are never supposed to be
64:33 killed over there because Africa didn't
64:36 have any regulations over there they
64:39 they knew that they didn't want this to
64:40 occur you know ivory was banned
64:42 internationally thank God many many
64:45 decades ago but Africa itself didn't
64:48 have the infrastructure to chase
64:50 poachers down with guns to help the
64:52 animals that have been injured by these
64:54 poachers and now all that infrastructure
64:56 exists and so Trump's looking at this
64:59 whole thing going but we still have the
65:01 old one our old regulations on our side
65:03 of the border
65:04 I mean customs though doesn't customs
65:07 check all the stuff anyway and they came
65:10 to tribal they said yes customs is doing
65:12 this job already we don't need another
65:14 agency behind customs to duplicate their
65:17 efforts because Africa is doing what
65:20 they can do and we're helping to fund
65:22 that directly and our customs handles
65:24 everything else go look at all the the
65:28 shows on Netflix which are all about
65:31 Canadian customs United States customs
65:34 and Australia customs it's a fascinating
65:36 show to watch how many people can't read
65:39 a little piece of paper that says hey
65:41 don't bring a bunch of [ __ ] over from
65:43 your country wherever the hell you went
65:44 and these people just play [ __ ]
65:46 stupid I mean it's it's interesting how
65:49 they it just it seems like either their
65:53 total abject morons which I refuse to
65:55 believe or they're just conniving
65:58 [ __ ] man they just can't tell
66:01 me I can't bring over a bunch of fruit
66:03 flies from some other country that'll
66:05 destroy all the vegetation and and
66:06 Australia it's unbelievable or people
66:11 think that because California has legal
66:13 weed that you can get on a plane with
66:16 weed in your bag and fly it to a state
66:19 outside of California that's a funny one
66:21 but here's the thing
66:23 in 1992 Southern California was utterly
66:27 destroyed by the recession that bush
66:31 senior gave the bankers right he leaves
66:35 he starts it up very similar process you
66:39 know this is what's funny by the
66:41 Republicans starting the recession
66:42 and the Democrat coming in and hanging
66:44 on to everything that's gonna make it
66:45 occur you don't know who to blame okay
66:50 what do we have the next recession well
66:53 the internet gave us nine years roughly
66:57 of relief which is about 1992 I mean the
67:06 recession really hit us around 1990 and
67:08 lasted all the way into like 1994 or so
67:12 but as the internet blew up America got
67:14 all of its money because it was this
67:16 amazing thing it's a one-in-a-million
67:17 situation we will not have that for
67:19 probably another hundred years until we
67:21 have some blow-up tech that just needs a
67:24 bunch of Engineers but 9/11 happens they
67:27 crash the economy because they need a
67:30 bunch of soldiers right so they're like
67:31 the ghetto kids to have absolutely no
67:33 recourse whatsoever and you know bunch
67:36 of rural white kids too
67:38 having the same exact problem so by 2003
67:42 we have a roaring recession all right
67:45 but Bill Clinton gets where the
67:50 glass-steagall Act Joe Biden in 2003 got
67:54 rid of the in three aggregate report
67:55 which tracked how the Federal Reserve a
67:57 private for-profit bank since our money
68:01 to foreign agencies in different
68:03 countries claiming that it was
68:05 duplicated in another report so he was
68:06 setting us up for the subprime loan
68:09 scandal so the subprime loan scandal was
68:13 kicked off by two Democrats and it only
68:17 takes if we say that the recession the
68:19 recession was in full effect by 2002 for
68:22 sure but I was gainfully employed for
68:25 the first three months of that year and
68:27 all the previous year of course but I
68:29 had friends who left Electronic Arts in
68:31 2001 who couldn't find any work at all
68:33 so it was pretty much here in 2001 nine
68:36 years after the one the bush senior
68:38 handed down well we all know what
68:41 happened next right by 2008 December the
68:45 stock market crash is thirty five
68:47 hundred points
68:49 boo
68:50 my clients dropped out of the sky like
68:54 birds hit by a harp antenna
68:56 I had one office in the north cranking
69:00 out probably I don't know six or seven
69:03 hundred thousand dollars a month and my
69:05 office in the South was a smaller office
69:08 that was doing probably anywhere from a
69:10 hundred by 75 to about 125 a month one
69:16 phone call after another
69:18 we lost $50,000
69:22 we lost $450,000 in our north office one
69:26 by one these companies went under 2008
69:30 but hey Obama just got into office was
69:34 handed off by the bush administration
69:35 but Obama had to pass out all the tarp
69:38 money because it was he just inherited
69:39 the problem all right we are now 2019
69:46 last recession hit in 2008 now again it
69:49 took we're still suffering the slings
69:52 and arrows of the 2008 recession we are
69:54 okay
69:55 my company didn't have to close his
69:58 stores until 2013 so I managed to
70:02 squeeze another five years out of it mmm
70:04 four and a half or whatever but that was
70:06 that was just unbelievably difficult for
70:09 us we had a ton of money in the bank
70:12 which floated us we are due right now
70:17 for their cycle of recessions to destroy
70:21 our lives once again now a lot of areas
70:25 in the world are going through a
70:26 recession right the EU is going through
70:29 a recession you know for the top
70:32 countries of the EU are bankrupt but
70:35 won't tell their people
70:36 China's had runs on their third largest
70:40 bank in the entire country the fourth
70:41 largest bank they've had to literally
70:44 shut down all the ATMs and tell people
70:46 look your money's here but we can't have
70:48 all you guys panicky and taking the
70:49 money out they're in trouble
70:51 they've had the worst year as Trump
70:53 keeps telling you but America has
70:57 generated millions of jobs in the last
71:00 three and a half years or three years I
71:02 should say
71:03 okay so where's the boogeyman that has
71:07 to be impeached and you think these
71:10 creepazoids
71:11 called the democrats are going to do
71:14 anything other than what they had done
71:16 in the past to deregulate the banking
71:19 allow them to take advantage of us again
71:21 and crash our economy remember a year
71:24 ago they were trying to say there was
71:25 going to be a recession the feds who
71:30 again which is the Federal Reserve which
71:32 is again a private for-profit bank it's
71:35 just like Chase Manhattan Bank there are
71:38 nothing federal about that bank okay
71:40 they threaten us with interest rates
71:44 going up too fast down too fast but
71:50 something happened on the back burner
71:51 because they started to behave they
71:55 started to behave so someone must have
71:57 said something like you know I'm gonna
72:00 replace you right you know that you have
72:03 a big number on your head that goes down
72:06 every day and as soon as it hits zero
72:07 you're gone so you can choose to behave
72:10 and make this a little easier on
72:12 yourself or I'll just shut you down and
72:18 I'll expose you and so they're playing
72:20 ball but the second that they can find a
72:25 strategy to screw us over and I mean
72:27 they're not screwing Trump Trump's a
72:29 billionaire okay
72:30 this guy will eat steaks until the day
72:33 he dies which you and I need stability
72:36 and so we got we have to keep the dude
72:38 in in office who love him or hate him
72:42 has made our worlds that much better in
72:46 a very short period of time okay we have
72:50 the equivalent of another Andrew Jackson
72:52 in office we have the equivalent perhaps
72:55 if he prints some greenbacks of another
72:58 Lincoln in office but that's going to
73:00 take a second term if anything men think
73:04 about it you got two choices
73:05 really you put a Democrat in office and
73:08 just watch it crash I mean just watch
73:11 this country turn into the [ __ ] that
73:13 San Francisco's turn into one of the
73:15 most beautiful cities in this country
73:16 is covered with more feces than asphalt
73:20 okay they screwed up Chicago they
73:24 screwed up delay they screwed up San
73:26 Francisco
73:28 Baltimore they screw up everything okay
73:31 when I moved in here 97 or 87 scuse me
73:35 in California we had a Republican
73:36 governor and a place was just a Swiss
73:40 watch man this place was booming the
73:45 only thing that's pissing off foreign
73:46 leaders and some of them are pissed off
73:48 at all
73:49 but the only thing it's potentially
73:51 pissing off a macron who's a Rothschild
73:54 proxy I mean that's legitimately what he
73:57 is what is Angela Merkel Hitler's
74:00 daughter I mean look it up man it's hard
74:05 to deny man she looks just like her
74:07 daddy
74:07 okay well they bankrupt France Italy
74:13 Spain and Germany their tits up man
74:18 they're printing money to stay out of
74:20 the [ __ ] hole at this point in all those
74:23 other countries you know some of them
74:24 are doing well so Mart Britain's pulling
74:26 out thank God it's a you know putting
74:30 Trump back in office in 2020 it's sort
74:33 of like to to a Democrat what I would
74:35 say is this was knowing these Democrats
74:38 listening to me at this point it's like
74:40 okay call his bluff you're trying to say
74:44 he's a horrible guy no call his bluff
74:46 put him in office in 2020 watch what
74:49 happens in four years because one of two
74:51 things is going to occur this country is
74:54 going to continue to get better for four
74:55 years it's going to get better for five
74:58 years if he gets in but according to a
75:01 Democrat won the three years of bliss
75:03 that we've had financially in this
75:06 country shouldn't have been possible
75:08 because he's such an idiot right so put
75:13 him in office again
75:14 because here's the thing America will
75:17 survive if you're right if you're right
75:20 he screws everything up okay which would
75:23 be a completely different course than
75:24 he's taken so far you want to set an
75:29 example right you need some
75:30 thing to rebirth a Democratic Party
75:32 because at this point you have a dying
75:35 breed you have a dying party so put him
75:39 in office again watch four more years
75:41 you're so certain he's gonna screw up
75:43 everything that by the time you have to
75:45 run in 2024 all you got to do is point
75:49 at the dummy and say see what Trump did
75:52 to our country our great country see how
75:55 we turned it into a dictatorship see how
75:57 he behaved like a king I mean I hear all
76:00 these ridiculous assertions from these
76:02 blowhard professors who've never worked
76:04 a single day in their life okay they've
76:07 never been in the public eye the whole
76:09 last five people or so that went in to
76:11 talk to the Democrats and that little
76:12 hearing in the basement hilarious they
76:16 have no knowledge of Trump personally or
76:19 any of his deeds they just walked in and
76:21 said we just think he's a dodo head he's
76:23 a poopy mouth I mean whatever it was
76:25 they just said a bunch of stuff about
76:27 the guy trying to legitimize a
76:29 completely illegitimate non legal
76:32 process trust me I don't give a [ __ ]
76:37 what country you live in
76:38 I don't give a [ __ ] what your political
76:40 affiliation is your gender your
76:43 orientation I don't care if you ever end
76:48 up in a court like the one that Adam
76:50 Schiff Nancy Pelosi Chuck Schumer Nadler
76:54 LED you will think you have gone into
76:59 idiocracy you will think that the devil
77:02 himself has taken over this planet and
77:05 you'll go off to some weird place to die
77:09 having not been charged with anything
77:12 but words that mean nothing that have
77:15 nothing to do with the legal system you
77:17 will be robbed of any legal
77:18 representation and they will be judge
77:22 and jury in a room well don't you hate
77:25 this guy yes well let's make up a bunch
77:26 of weird [ __ ] okay write it down okay
77:28 those are the articles of beach man that
77:29 makes it sound good right
77:31 he's a dodo head number one right that's
77:33 an article of impeachment
77:35 it's a non-legal accusation it's not a
77:39 crime but that's what they're trying to
77:42 push on you
77:42 all right I think I've made my point
77:47 there it's a brief overview most of the
77:51 details aren't there if you really want
77:52 to see the details go look up the x-22
77:55 channel go look up that that sticks 666
78:00 guy he's brilliant you look up pursuit
78:03 of truth channel go look up the SG T
78:07 reports some of these folks are really
78:10 religious I am NOT but I I absolutely
78:13 praise their assessments of information
78:16 in a lot of cases now some of these guys
78:18 went down the project Looking Glass
78:20 rabbit hole completely and by the way
78:23 that just disappeared didn't it not
78:24 really funny it's good he walked away
78:27 from that because he's like whoa I did
78:29 not mean time-travel and remote viewing
78:31 I just was talking about a clandestine
78:34 project of which you don't know anything
78:35 about okay anyway if you haven't been to
78:41 deep thoughts radio.com please go this
78:43 is where we have all of the materials
78:45 one the website really works well I've
78:48 been using it a lot to update bright T
78:51 on so update on bright young you know
78:53 I've been very pissed at this place
78:54 because they make you have to prove
78:57 you're popular before you get the chance
78:59 to upload all of your content well
79:01 obviously my season one is not as
79:03 popular as my season four you know so
79:08 they've bumped us all up to what's
79:09 called level fifty which means you can
79:12 have 50 videos on your channel without
79:14 having to prove how popular you are so
79:17 you know I I probably still won't hit
79:20 their minimum quota to get to the next
79:23 level but who knows with fifty videos up
79:26 there there's the moon with 26 there's
79:29 the flatterer it's 51 so I think I'm
79:32 gonna hit because I've taken out a few
79:33 episodes I'll have a little over fifty
79:35 up though the number system will go up
79:37 over fifty because I've taken two of
79:39 them out I think the two I took out were
79:42 I redid the cancer episode which was
79:44 seventeen so it's not there and I think
79:47 34 is missing which might have been the
79:51 European Union which was should have
79:54 been a special report because it was
79:55 very timely
79:56 and a lot of those observations are so
79:59 antiquated I just got rid of it but
80:01 anyway so we're gonna have fifty plus
80:03 we'll have fifty videos up there the
80:05 numbers will skew a little bit so that's
80:08 good
80:08 anyway we have YouTube and [ __ ] shoot
80:11 for the videos please dear God go get a
80:14 bit shoot account they need our support
80:15 just in the form of registered accounts
80:18 you don't have to watch your content
80:20 there but just remember if you can if
80:22 you're sitting at your computer or your
80:24 phone they have an app for your phone
80:26 it's kind of a weird site but it looks
80:29 good and it works well obviously there's
80:32 plenty of links for your podcast just
80:33 get on your podcast device and put it up
80:36 there I am I do apologize for being a
80:38 little late but the pipeline to get
80:39 everything up there takes a long time
80:42 because I have to wait for the videos to
80:44 fully encode then I have to convert the
80:46 video into audio a lot of uploading and
80:49 all kinds of stuff and then I have to go
80:51 to WordPress and put the article in so I
80:54 have to upload these videos now at least
80:57 in two different locations right down
81:01 continues to increase our limits will be
81:03 three different locations but so we're
81:05 backed up with with [ __ ] shoot as far
81:08 as social media we have a lock Facebook
81:10 group a Twitter page and mine's calm
81:13 mine's calm as I keep telling you is
81:14 better than Facebook First Amendment
81:16 supported and no one's on it but it'd be
81:20 really nice if we all going over there
81:22 be nice if Facebook had a catastrophic
81:24 event and we all had to find a
81:27 competitor cuz mines would be the
81:28 greatest place to go after that as far
81:31 as donating to the show there's PayPal
81:33 and patreon and kin patreon users get
81:36 the videos before anyone else about 85%
81:38 of the time in some cases when I'm doing
81:42 like a doubleheader or I've got three
81:43 videos in the queue they get it for
81:45 almost a week before you guys get it so
81:47 for a buck that's what you get - all of
81:50 you support me thank you so much for
81:52 those who've you donated on PayPal thank
81:53 you so much by the way if you do get on
81:57 patreon you get a 20% discount on the
81:58 store and you get in the credits for the
82:00 rest of your life let's make that a
82:03 really long bumper at the end there's
82:06 two products that I love I want to get
82:09 you guys all on the brave browser
82:10 and switch your search engine from
82:12 Google to DuckDuckGo if you ever have a
82:15 problem with dr. go finding what you
82:16 want you can always go back to Google
82:17 and do a little search but the cool
82:19 thing about brave and DuckDuckGo is they
82:21 don't track anything they don't sell
82:22 your metrics to anyone they don't know
82:24 who you are they don't want to know who
82:25 you are so it's like it's like a tor
82:28 browser without the VPN horseshit
82:32 it doesn't really protect you anyway so
82:35 do that if you need backup software for
82:37 your computers the cheapest infinite
82:39 storage facility is called Backblaze com
82:42 $7 a month infinite storage for one
82:45 computer you can go back a year with
82:47 seven bucks you can go back I think a
82:50 month with five bucks so just put the
82:52 two extra bucks in and get yourself
82:53 fully protected
82:54 I had Miss quoted that as two computers
82:56 for seven bucks I apologize I actually
82:58 had two accounts I didn't even know it
82:59 if you think about Dropbox Dropbox for
83:02 12 bucks gives you a terabyte or two two
83:05 terabytes I've got 16 terabytes on up on
83:10 the cloud for seven bucks that's pretty
83:13 good there's an all-new remastered
83:16 season one so you won't find any season
83:18 1 episodes on this channel so get over
83:20 there and click the link watch the
83:21 videos they're shorter they're better
83:24 there's no copyrighted material in them
83:26 thank God so it's all fixed up I have
83:29 created two new shirts for season 5 one
83:32 of them is just an homage to the UFO
83:34 that we have landing in the backyard and
83:36 the other one is a UFO
83:38 I like UFO shirt which is hopefully fun
83:41 for you guys and it's designed generally
83:43 after the sports model that Bob Lazar
83:46 said he worked on which is usually the
83:49 one that they account a tribute to the
83:51 Roswell crash so hopefully that's fun
83:53 it's definitely going to be a
83:54 conversation starter that's the cool
83:57 thing other than that I think that's all
83:59 I've got for you on this 47 degree night
84:02 take care of yourself in someone else
84:04 I'll see you in the next deep thoughts
84:06 over now
84:08 [Music]

84:11 [Music]
84:16 [Applause]
84:20 you
