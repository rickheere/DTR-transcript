00:00 [Music]
00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:37 gentlemen today we are going to discuss
00:41 something that I'm gonna call the
00:43 left/right doctrine your spy card the
00:48 left right brain doctrine but we could
00:51 keep a cryptic in there would be like
00:52 what are you talking about political
00:53 thing you're right no talking about your
00:56 brain I had a request in one of the
00:59 social media outlets there are so many
01:02 these days to cover this so what's this
01:06 about well you know it's kind of
01:10 interesting because it this whole thing
01:14 has been imposed on us probably by
01:16 people who don't know what they're
01:16 talking about
01:17 I don't know but they've told us that
01:20 the right side of our brain is creative
01:22 and the left side of our brain is
01:25 logical I would like to say that maybe
01:28 the right side of your brain can see the
01:30 abstract reality of the universe and
01:34 left side of your brain deals with the
01:38 executional minutiae of existing all the
01:43 rule longer'n that happens right we all
01:47 invariably know people that are
01:48 extremely left brain couldn't be
01:52 creative if their life depended on it
01:55 and then we know abstract people that
01:57 couldn't pay a bill or keep a job if
02:00 their life depended on it
02:03 the Egyptians as we have rediscovered
02:07 them in the 21st century and again we
02:08 could be again full of crap but we're on
02:11 the next level it doesn't appear as if
02:13 we are full of crap but maybe we're
02:16 romanticizing things and romanticizing
02:18 things is going to be a sub plot to this
02:21 entire episode the anal-retentive demand
02:27 that we are robotic ly true or false
02:30 that those who don't have every
02:34 meticulous detail in place should be
02:37 punished and if you embellish or
02:39 romanticize around a curve on that
02:42 furniture you are a heretic
02:46 a very left brain procedure now I read
02:53 an amazing article in the late 80s when
02:55 I used to subscribe to a couple things a
02:58 psychology psychiatric book club yes I
03:05 was a very strange 18 19 year old they
03:10 got belonged to 3 book clubs to
03:12 cosmology / science / electronics
03:16 robotics book clubs which I really
03:19 missus it was awesome and you got a book
03:20 every month they picked it so you just
03:23 got a good rounded nature and you got
03:24 discounts on other books it's just
03:26 awesome but then I had this subscription
03:29 to Psychology Today and just being
03:34 inquisitive about all things you know I
03:37 was probably chartered very similar to
03:39 the way I am today but not as
03:41 knowledgeable or perhaps even as logical
03:44 but I don't know I read an article about
03:46 something called stringers and groupers
03:50 stringers are your left-hand logical
03:53 super anal retentive people that feel
03:57 naughty if they're the slightest bit
03:59 chaotic abstract or right-brained your
04:04 right brain people are you're very
04:08 abstract kind of individuals that can
04:10 get the gist of things they have
04:15 intelligence instead of just smarts
04:17 right
04:18 if stringers are just smart people your
04:20 groupers are intelligent people and so a
04:24 smart person has to be told the whole
04:28 number set well that's one two three
04:30 four five seven eight nine ten as long
04:33 as both groups know the base-10 counting
04:35 system a gripper will listen to you like
04:38 at an IQ test and they'll say okay guess
04:40 the rest of the numbers here's the first
04:42 4 1 2 3 4 and the gripper goes will easy
04:45 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 on and on right yeah you
04:49 got it but if you said 2 4 6
04:51 then the gripper goes 8 10 12 14 because
04:56 the groupers intelligent and sees that
04:58 you're skipping one
04:59 and counting in the evens but a stringer
05:02 will sit there and go I don't know I
05:04 don't know the if you don't tell me I
05:06 don't know cuz I'm a lazy [ __ ] is really
05:09 what it amounts to
05:11 I just know too many of these people
05:13 that bother me right get off your lazy
05:15 ass and use your [ __ ] brain or jump
05:18 off a goddamn bridge because [ __ ] me why
05:21 are you alive
05:22 right set it off the way we do on deep
05:26 thoughts but by the time the Egyptians
05:29 had gained control of things
05:31 and I'm I'm gonna wager 50,000 years AD
05:35 at least if not a hundred or two hundred
05:38 thousand years right they had figured
05:42 out the to round out a human being you
05:46 had to have smarts you're sort of your
05:48 databank of rules and then you had to
05:52 have intelligence which is how to
05:54 actually use them in the proprietary
05:56 conditions of which the circumstances
06:00 are in the now right so imagine you
06:03 learn a few techniques to block rain
06:06 from hitting you in the head and so
06:08 there's one set of rules that are really
06:10 good during a little kind of misty rain
06:14 and then there's another set of rules
06:15 and a tropical storm versus another set
06:17 of rules and a hurricane right but a
06:22 smart person if you did not tell them
06:25 all of the rules and all the connectors
06:27 the stringer fails miserably so what is
06:32 a stringer and what is a grouper let's
06:35 get more detail well if you ever watch
06:38 someone read a book you will know
06:40 whether or not they are a stringer or a
06:41 grouper especially a technical book a
06:44 grouper will take the manual to the tv1
06:50 they'll try to set the television based
06:52 on previous knowledge oh yeah there I
06:54 see there's the power there's the cable
06:55 whoo where's the port again oh yeah well
06:57 I got for a while it's cool
06:59 turn it on and the menuing system gets
07:02 really confusing maybe and then you go
07:06 into a manual to figure out the one
07:07 thing that's confusing you you look in
07:09 the index first or maybe the table of
07:11 contents
07:12 index is always better because it's
07:14 alphabetized and sorted look on the page
07:17 find the solution start to understand
07:20 the gist of what the interface designer
07:22 was trying to do and then eventually you
07:24 start going oh I see what this guy did
07:26 yeah it's this way this way this way
07:28 it's totally confusing once I figure out
07:30 this one thing I figure out the whole
07:31 thing but your stringer
07:34 well they'll keep the TV in the box get
07:38 out the manual start on page one and
07:41 they will read every single word on
07:43 every single page from start to finish
07:45 and what's interesting about it is when
07:48 they get to the end they don't really
07:50 know what they read a stringer is an
07:53 extreme left brainer and almost no one
07:56 is a purist extreme stringer your
07:59 grouper is obviously the person that is
08:02 built as the world exists which is
08:04 abstract and object oriented stringers
08:08 do extremely well in school but not so
08:11 good in life now they may actually land
08:14 a job a lot easier in some cases than a
08:16 grouper but they're just if you ask him
08:19 if that's what they really wanted to do
08:21 with their life the answer is no I just
08:24 do this because it pays the bills I was
08:26 afraid of life and so I retreated away
08:28 from my true dreams and goals and now
08:33 I'm going to make excuses and hate
08:36 anyone who notices I'm talking from
08:40 experience meeting these people close
08:43 friends family your grouper well they
08:48 want to live in the destiny they want to
08:51 live in perhaps the more romanticized
08:54 version of their world the world happens
08:58 completely unexpectedly right you drive
09:00 down the highway and things happen that
09:02 are unexpected you go outside and the
09:04 weather is different even if they didn't
09:05 have planes that created clouds now life
09:09 is chaotic and that is what a grouper is
09:11 built to digest now if you think about
09:15 it the academic side of the world the
09:17 logical side of the world is now
09:19 predominant over the right side of the
09:22 world they've defunded the arts they
09:23 make sure kid doesn't know how to play
09:24 an instrument draw paint
09:26 edit a video whatever so the left side
09:31 is dominated the right the back in the
09:34 day it was always gonna be the right
09:35 dominating the left in fact the left was
09:37 probably this teeny tiny kernel is just
09:39 instinctual genetic rules about you know
09:42 sharp things cut you so get away from
09:45 them
09:45 animals eat you so be aware the Sun
09:48 provides light information and heals at
09:51 night you better have a place to hide
09:53 while the Predators come out at night
09:55 but the Egyptians understood this as we
09:58 now understand them through the
10:00 hieroglyphs when I studied etiology for
10:03 about six years in the 90s completely my
10:06 own research but again I would go to
10:08 Stanford I'd go into San Francisco
10:10 we had a magazine called k2 that was out
10:12 of San Francisco I would contact the
10:14 archaeologists in the magazine via the
10:16 internet what was brand new I bought
10:21 books that were published from pretty
10:23 much the 1890s all the way to about the
10:25 1940s just to read the initial
10:27 impressions versus today's impressions
10:30 completely bogus information now that I
10:34 look back again we now know that the
10:38 pyramids were built to be power
10:40 generators they were it's scientifically
10:44 proven if they built if we built that
10:45 thing today with the outer valence stone
10:48 limestone that was of a non-conductive
10:51 nature that thing would start sparking
10:53 but that's for the other conversation
10:56 we've already had in terms of
10:58 right-brain left-brain
10:59 the history of Egypt goes that a
11:03 character named Menace Meents
11:07 united north and south Egypt I mean they
11:10 were all balkanized and divided north
11:13 for us was there south and south for
11:15 them was our north
11:16 they were upside down compared to our
11:18 compass today poor Neil deGrasse Tyson
11:21 and his pear-shaped earth and they only
11:24 spoken with the Egyptians figure out
11:27 what up down was in the universe but
11:30 back in the day was all cut up like the
11:32 United States of America like North and
11:35 South had States vulcanized the areas
11:37 that had their own gods and Anubis was a
11:39 complete
11:40 Ramsey's was Earth's Aria raw was a
11:43 complete god anubis was a complete gut
11:46 Newt was a complete gut meaning that God
11:49 provided everything birth rights and and
11:53 weather and crops but when Menace United
11:58 the two they went around and said ok you
12:00 can't keep your God the way you have had
12:02 him for a really long time could you
12:04 imagine that like there's like 20
12:06 jesus's all over Egypt and someone says
12:13 well he can't do it all he's this guy
12:15 this one here he's gonna do the cross
12:17 thing this one over here is gonna turn
12:18 water into wine this one over here I
12:19 make a bunch of fish and bread and these
12:22 people had to absorb it it's when I lost
12:24 all faith and made me religions because
12:27 I saw an archetype of things that
12:30 happened a long long time ago and said
12:32 well [ __ ] that's what's been going on
12:33 you know but the way that the
12:36 Egyptologist today I think potentially
12:39 pollutes the hieroglyphs of yesteryear
12:42 is that the there's two types of crowns
12:45 or this there's this woman crown that's
12:47 kind of a nice bagpipe or something
12:51 there's a roundish thing and then you
12:53 have this very angular war helmet crown
13:00 that is worn by different car to shoes
13:03 and then you'll find at a later period
13:09 you can combine them together the one
13:11 which one goes inside the the sharp one
13:14 well the official take on this is one
13:17 crown as the south of one crown as the
13:18 north and as things were united they
13:23 would wear both crowns now part of that
13:27 makes absolutely no goddamn sense
13:28 because you have leaders and rulers in
13:30 both areas and there's not going to be
13:32 this hey I'll wear yours your wear mine
13:34 crap right but there's a gentleman the
13:39 the pyramid code I believe it's now on
13:42 Netflix which is a BBC series that is
13:45 actually mind-blowing ly amazing that as
13:49 I understand it the BBC won't broadcast
13:51 it anymore
13:52 so these folks got the rights back to it
13:54 and put it on Netflix and now it's an HD
13:56 I remember watching it on net on YouTube
13:58 and I don't know 480p or some crazy low
14:01 resolution and it goes in phases and
14:05 there's one gentleman towards the later
14:07 part of the series that talks about the
14:09 fact that they understood the chambers
14:11 of the mind the temples are built to
14:13 mock the human body meaning there's that
14:16 one room what's considered the head has
14:18 the seven chambers of the mind and then
14:20 the chest is another room with pillars
14:22 for every single rib we have on our
14:24 ribcage and then it goes down to
14:26 splitting into two quarters for each leg
14:29 in a foot it's amazing
14:30 once we saw what this guy was talking
14:32 about I was like oh my god how the hell
14:34 do we miss this because we were told by
14:37 pasty white guys that that Blackie was
14:40 dumb and so we never thought that maybe
14:43 they were actually not only smart but
14:45 smarter than us today right nothing
14:49 worse than language that is used to
14:51 manipulate the mind calling a superior
14:54 race culture species whatever maybe
14:58 they're aliens right telling them
15:02 savages and primitives just
15:03 automatically guts any value of anything
15:07 they might share with you but now we
15:10 think that the womb which crowned is the
15:12 right brain the soft more again female
15:18 right brain and that has to do with
15:22 raising children of being empathetic and
15:24 understanding the husband understanding
15:26 the village holding it together on a
15:28 metaphysical level extremely extremely
15:30 important however we need to build
15:33 shelters water wells we need to hunt
15:36 kill eat all that so men get the upper
15:39 body strength to run off with left brain
15:41 and take advantage of all of our
15:42 instinctual programming to kill again
15:45 I'll remind you that you know all of
15:48 these young adults that beat the [ __ ]
15:51 out of each other at soccer matches
15:52 slash football matches in Europe all of
15:56 the bros in America we're sitting at
15:58 bars just waiting to be offended on one
16:00 level they're a big [ __ ] snowflake
16:02 and you know their level their you know
16:03 their gene Hackman
16:05 [ __ ] out of somebody at some bar
16:07 gangster rap heavy-metal music is an
16:10 outlet for man's instinctual coding to
16:15 get up every single day of his life
16:17 until he reaches an elderly age where he
16:19 can't participate which would have been
16:21 extremely old I mean you're talking
16:23 about probably 75 80 back in the day
16:27 before a man would give up participating
16:29 and throwing a spear or providing some
16:31 service that after the animal is killed
16:32 the older guys might you know cut it
16:35 open gut it and get it ready for eating
16:37 but this is our program ladies and
16:40 gentlemen and so we're all dealing with
16:42 the way to deal with that energy in that
16:44 programming without losing our [ __ ]
16:46 minds right what are these guys you know
16:50 they're I've been watching a lot of
16:52 stolen valor episodes on YouTube lately
16:55 it's just a fascinating thing that
16:57 people would wear a uniform and lie
16:59 about it right on one side they want to
17:02 be I would say the endearing side of it
17:05 is that people wish they had joined the
17:07 military for whatever reason they didn't
17:09 and so they're trying to be part of that
17:11 group which obviously is extremely
17:14 offensive to a soldier who's lost
17:16 buddies in that whole thing totally
17:19 understandable then you have your
17:21 scumbags that go off the mall simply to
17:24 get a 20% discount on a Starbucks but
17:29 they want to be tough and they want to
17:30 be honorable and so they go into this
17:32 thing on the other side right but the
17:35 reason why this episode exists is
17:36 because if you know it doesn't take long
17:39 to realize that the Egyptians
17:40 essentially built an entire culture
17:44 where the woman in the house was to
17:47 teach her husband how to be right brain
17:48 to be more understanding and empathetic
17:50 and he was there to teach her to be more
17:53 logical an understanding and perhaps
17:55 gain some skills that he had right total
17:59 balance well in America when America had
18:03 his [ __ ] together before we let these
18:06 deep Staters infiltrate our country with
18:08 the the Charter that was at a head in
18:15 1973 when Charla is Herbie wrote her
18:17 book
18:18 the dumbing down of America the
18:20 deliberate dumbing down of America we
18:22 knew what we needed to do reading
18:24 writing and arithmetic really attack
18:26 really attacked the left brain
18:28 requirements in order to acquire much of
18:32 what you'll need on the right side but
18:33 not absolute we also had the arts we
18:39 drew we wrote our script in cursive I
18:42 want to encourage every single one of
18:44 you I don't give a [ __ ] what country
18:45 you're from what language is your
18:48 language get back into cursive teach
18:52 your kids cursive and teach your kids
18:54 this because you need to learn this too
18:56 if you don't know cursive is a way to
18:59 constantly manipulate the right side of
19:02 your brain and again what you feed is
19:05 what grows we have this beautiful
19:08 scripture you know I did a whole episode
19:09 last season on the 1950s 60s series on
19:14 television on CBS called what's my line
19:16 which means what's your job there's a 20
19:18 questions game where four panelists
19:20 without knowing what you do guess what
19:23 you do and you yes/no you get ten tries
19:25 ten knows and you're out of the game
19:26 right well everyone who gets onto the
19:28 show if you haven't seen this no matter
19:31 if you're celebrity or not you have to
19:32 write your name on a blackboard chalk on
19:35 a blackboard and when I see these people
19:37 write this beautiful script someone who
19:40 can write it so fast it's ridiculous but
19:42 it looks amazing it breaks my heart that
19:45 we now sign everything in some printed
19:48 character form a printed character when
19:54 you write it as a left brain procedure
19:57 predominantly for instance when you draw
20:01 I used to you know be the hot thing in
20:07 school when it came to being an artist
20:08 and I was the assistant teachers
20:10 assistant and all this other stuff and
20:13 when I would see kids that drew really
20:15 really well it's always a fluent motion
20:16 here and there and now you do pick up
20:18 your pencil trust me but the idea is I
20:21 would see other kids that were doing
20:22 this scratchy line like if they just
20:25 want to draw a line straight across the
20:27 piece of paper was scratch scratch
20:28 scratch scratch
20:29 scratch scritch and then if we want to
20:31 do a curve scratch scratch scratch goes
20:32 the whole image when it's finished looks
20:34 like a big scratch art and hey if that's
20:36 what you're gonna do is that a
20:37 pointillism you're doing scratch ism
20:40 knock yourself out but these kids are
20:42 trying to draw something that looks
20:43 relatively photographic because that's
20:46 what the assignment was but that is the
20:50 left brain trying to create a right
20:51 brain object it is a risk management
20:55 risk assessment situation where it's
20:57 like I don't want to get this wrong so
20:58 I'm gonna make little tiny lines and
21:00 they'll all attach to a big line because
21:01 of I commit to a whole arm stroke I
21:04 could get it wrong and the whole thing's
21:06 wrong where if I scritch scratch scritch
21:07 scratch scritch I can constantly change
21:10 the trajectory but in the end the thing
21:13 you're creating doesn't look anything
21:14 like what you were trying to draw
21:16 there's a great book called gödel Escher
21:18 Bach you'd have gödel use a poet
21:24 Escher's like this mathematical artist
21:28 and then you have Bach which is a
21:30 musician and the beautiful thing is the
21:34 original logo on the book was a cube
21:36 that had been cut in such a way that GE
21:40 B was capable of being seen if you put
21:45 lights through it and so it was cut in a
21:47 certain way that letters were projecting
21:48 out of one cube all three letters
21:50 beautiful because what the book is
21:52 trying to do is teach you that these
21:56 different disciplines will make you a
21:59 rounded human being it's extremely
22:03 important a yin to the yang this is one
22:08 of the reasons why the the family was
22:12 destroyed the powers would be known they
22:16 understand quite well that the woman has
22:17 the right brain and the man has the left
22:19 brain predominantly at birth and again
22:21 by being married and going through the
22:23 troubles and the angst of dealing with
22:26 all the issues that a partnership
22:28 creates that eventually you'll round
22:30 each other out and you'll become amazing
22:32 beings in your elderly years hopefully
22:36 quicker than that right so the brick
22:38 created the kids out and they're just
22:40 sitting there with right bringing mom or
22:41 left-brained dad mostly
22:43 time right-brain mom and again there's
22:45 no there's no crime there but she
22:47 doesn't have the pressure to learn the
22:49 left side of things and he doesn't have
22:51 the pressure to go right the side of
22:52 things and again I have relatives that
22:54 are completely reversed right
22:56 the guys are utter right-brainers and
22:59 the women are utter left brainers and
23:01 they never achieved the other side it's
23:04 really sad right because they aren't
23:07 complete even in the remotest fashion I
23:10 remember hearing about Russia as a kid
23:13 and in Russia they said that you had to
23:14 learn how to play a classical instrument
23:16 you were forced to be in dance you were
23:20 forced to be in the arts from all
23:22 mediums of you know lead pencil ink well
23:27 pin all the way up to probably oils and
23:31 acrylics or the way other way around but
23:35 they're also massively known for being
23:37 engineers I mean every single science on
23:40 planet Earth from every every category
23:42 medical science to everything of
23:45 astrophysics in aerospace and
23:48 mathematicians you're to love both sides
23:52 of the fence but America in the 80s and
23:58 90s had all of the wealth not all of the
24:00 majority of the arts completely defunded
24:03 I had to teach art at my daughter's
24:06 school I said this once before gotta go
24:10 get a TV tests and a TV shot to teach
24:12 Hunter school and then I was only able
24:14 to complete about three classes before
24:16 the teachers being left brain oh I've
24:21 got some good good names for those
24:23 people we'll just settle on losers the
24:27 kids were drawing better than they were
24:29 and these old [ __ ] got really jealous
24:31 and started sabotaging the class in fact
24:35 they put the whole class out for recess
24:37 two minutes before I arrived now keep in
24:39 mind I had to develop a syllabus
24:41 submitted to the distance cool district
24:43 get it approved and Brandon handed to
24:45 the teachers so teachers know exactly
24:47 what I was teaching when I was teaching
24:48 it wasn't some hey kids let's just mess
24:50 around so the third time I went there
24:53 the kids on recess just like a Pied
24:56 Piper
24:57 they put down those rubber balls and all
24:59 that crap and said I'm balling this guy
25:00 he's teaching me something I'm having
25:02 fun with and so again I would do my Tet
25:05 at my my excuse me
25:07 methodology on the on the board of
25:09 teaching how to draw faces first and the
25:12 teachers would sit in the back up on
25:16 their big rolls of fat you know and they
25:18 were trying to follow and they couldn't
25:20 follow because they're just left brain
25:22 unionized workers and they're like the
25:28 daycare teachers at night right not the
25:30 academic so I have no idea what the
25:32 normal teachers were like but by the
25:35 fourth class they held a birthday right
25:38 in my timeslot I should have written a
25:42 letter in protest but I was just like I
25:44 [ __ ] this this is a sad day for
25:48 America didn't have this show didn't
25:50 have the other show was about two
25:52 thousand three or four but that's when I
25:55 realized Jesus
25:56 this thing is so defunded and by letting
26:00 these old tarts run these classes they
26:05 sabotage the kids futures personally
26:08 heresy man heresy unbelievable but we
26:14 know that America has lost its mojo
26:16 but now let's parse the arts just for a
26:19 split second because I want to make a
26:20 little point there the arts need to be
26:23 funded at a K through 12 level that is
26:27 where it is important the arts do not
26:29 need to fund college level students
26:32 outside I mean they can do it but
26:33 there's plenty of money out there from
26:35 all kinds of different groups that want
26:37 to write off cash to handle you know
26:41 some guy that wants to put whips up
26:43 holes and take black-and-white pictures
26:45 of it we don't need to fund that crap we
26:47 don't need to fund some you know I don't
26:50 know just some crazy [ __ ] after high
26:52 school the kids need it because it's not
26:55 important that they become sculptors and
26:57 artists I mean it's cool if they do and
26:59 if they're good there's always going to
27:01 be a customer right but our children
27:05 need the other side of life such that
27:07 when life occurs
27:09 again the stringers are typically
27:13 unhappy hmm follow the rules always wish
27:18 they had developed a destiny and then
27:20 followed it whereas your right-brainers
27:23 or maybe not the richest people in the
27:26 world
27:27 goddammit they're living they're having
27:29 fun right okay I know you understand
27:32 that but now let's look at the anatomy
27:36 of the left brain in the right brain the
27:39 left brain and variably holds by design
27:42 the rules the rules of the universe we
27:47 are born with rules we have the choice
27:49 of whether or not we follow them or not
27:51 you know walking off the cliff or not
27:53 walking off the cliff the DNA that's
27:55 pretty disobedient to those early
27:58 instinctual patterns will they they're
28:01 all dead
28:01 their DNA didn't go very far because
28:03 they walked off the cliff those of us
28:05 with a mind to say wow that looks like a
28:08 lion I should get the [ __ ] out of here
28:09 they lived but the guy was like you know
28:13 you say it's a lion maybe it's not
28:17 they're dead and on the right brain side
28:23 you sort of have loose associations
28:26 you're sort of like oh that's happening
28:29 you know last time that happened all
28:31 this other stuff happened I wonder if
28:32 that's gonna happen
28:33 and you look around you have
28:34 associations maybes no it didn't happen
28:37 oh that's cool oh there it is oh yeah
28:39 yeah gonna cool look over there that's
28:41 cool
28:42 whereas your left brain person's gonna
28:44 have a [ __ ] head just explode with
28:45 something like that happens cuz they're
28:47 like oh my god I don't know what's gonna
28:49 happen here these things connect that
28:51 you know so when we interact as human
28:55 beings you can very easily see or since
28:59 well then a person is predominantly left
29:02 or predominantly right now give you some
29:05 examples that were in the article people
29:07 who read books from cover to cover and
29:09 if they skip a page oh my god they feel
29:10 so naughty they can't sleep until they
29:12 find out what page they didn't but the
29:14 page they missed when they were their
29:15 car or whatever whereas the groupers
29:17 like man I yeah I read the CliffsNotes
29:20 and I read a bunch of it but it kind of
29:22 sucks I put it
29:23 why read a whole big piece of [ __ ] just
29:25 to prove I don't like it right but when
29:29 you communicate between two people it's
29:30 very fascinating you know I'm talking on
29:33 the show quite a bit and I have a lot of
29:36 things that I try to remember from my
29:38 research you know I don't again I said I
29:43 had two episodes with notes magna carta
29:45 and the CERN Hadron Collider just to get
29:48 the acronyms down and for my ID card I
29:50 was to get the years right but that's it
29:53 so I make mistakes all the time all the
29:56 time I'll use a name wrong get a year
30:00 wrong but I'm a grouper
30:05 so I care about accuracy trust me but I
30:10 don't I don't have a sleeping problem
30:15 due to it for me it's like okay well if
30:19 someone you know brings up dude you got
30:21 it wrong you know Buzz Aldrin is not
30:22 dead you know Gus Grissom died oh yeah I
30:26 know I [ __ ] that up but yeah a lot of
30:29 you knew what I meant and then I put the
30:31 comments in the comment section too
30:33 to prove that I understand that this is
30:35 wrong answer a question here there but
30:40 again I'm not dying over it and I'm not
30:42 taking the video down just because of
30:45 that problem I forget it's something
30:47 totally I agree egregious then maybe but
30:51 you all know those people who are
30:54 technicality people and when I was a kid
30:58 again I I've said the story a couple
31:00 times out of 350 episodes but my mother
31:04 got me this set of cassette tapes when I
31:05 first moved to California in 87 and by
31:09 88 I was listening to this thing at
31:12 night it was brilliant it must have been
31:13 about 12 cassettes at least and it was
31:19 the most valuable thing ever looked like
31:23 she bought enough TV though it was some
31:26 sort of I don't know if he was a
31:28 psychologist but he's definitely a life
31:29 coach and he just had tons and tons of
31:33 ideas and he talked about manifest
31:36 destiny
31:37 where you he talked about getting
31:38 parking spaces and he goes I can get a
31:40 two parking spaces any time of day any
31:42 place and he goes I never pay for lunch
31:44 because I can always do it and I'll bet
31:47 someone lunch I can get two parking
31:48 spaces they'll say okay I take the bet
31:51 and then he just drives through the
31:52 parking lot manifesting those parking
31:54 spaces and he gets it but the one huge
31:57 one that if I could pass this to anyone
31:59 that hasn't heard this and is still
32:01 doing it
32:02 you'll thank me and thank him and thank
32:03 whoever the hell taught him he said you
32:06 know when you're at a party and you find
32:09 a group of people discussing something
32:11 he says you'll want to make sure you're
32:13 not the guy that that rushes into the
32:15 conversation to tell everyone that
32:17 they're wrong I thought that was
32:20 fascinating he says don't also try to go
32:22 in and try to be the guy that tells
32:23 everybody how everything is dominating
32:26 the conversation not sharing it and
32:28 showboating your intelligence slash your
32:32 smarts and I think at the time I was
32:37 probably more like the latter I was so
32:39 young now I mean what groups that ever
32:41 get into they gave a [ __ ] about what I
32:43 thought so I didn't have any chance to
32:44 really practice to get it wrong so I
32:49 never made the mistake in any egregious
32:51 way but then automatically he
32:53 enlightened me so I started seeing the
32:55 problem mm-hmm and then you get the
33:00 people who try to police you when you
33:04 think about someone coming up to you for
33:06 political correctness and telling you
33:07 what words are authorized today the
33:11 [ __ ] 1984
33:13 modified language what kind of person do
33:18 you think you're talking to a right
33:20 brain person or a left brain person of
33:22 course the left someone whose rule
33:25 mongering they can't find a way to make
33:28 themselves valuable in this world and so
33:30 they imposed themselves on you as your
33:32 pseudo authoritarian telling you what
33:35 you can and can't do and they will
33:37 demonize in their brain to some huge
33:39 snow flaky emotional meltdown level the
33:44 rules because the rules are more
33:46 important than being human being alive
33:49 being
33:50 abstract I'm having a smooth edge versus
33:52 always a sharp edge
33:53 well I cut the edge of that desk and
33:56 it's cut and it's sharp but it's all
33:59 90-degree angles look at the precision
34:01 of what I did and the romantic person
34:04 comes in and goes yeah but I bumped
34:06 myself on it yesterday and I still got a
34:08 cut so I'm gonna round this [ __ ] off
34:10 I'm gonna throw away functional would
34:13 simply to give it a romantic shape
34:16 there's an old Twilight Zone I think
34:19 it's called the great frisbee it's about
34:23 an old man sitting in his hardware store
34:25 or is sort of all-purpose general store
34:27 as a grocery in it and stuff teeny tiny
34:30 place and there must be a dozen guys
34:32 around this little dude listening to him
34:35 tell the tallest tales in the world and
34:37 they love it they pretend to hate it but
34:40 then they love it
34:41 some of them don't know if he's telling
34:44 some truth and some lights some guys are
34:48 trying to figure out whether or not he's
34:51 completely true so it's just a great a
34:54 great series again it looks like Malcolm
34:56 Adele but he's 20 years before Malcolm
34:59 maybe 10 years before Malcolm this is
35:02 where Mars attack came from the movie
35:04 and it's where the Richter vase movie
35:07 about him being in a world that didn't
35:09 it didn't know what a lie was comes from
35:12 it's this episode this one episode was
35:13 responsible for two other scripts but we
35:16 all know a frisbee usually especially if
35:19 you're in the Midwest and you're over 45
35:21 you probably had an uncle a father or
35:24 someone of that nature in your life in
35:27 your family circle especially you live
35:28 in a small town right that that would
35:31 embellish I caught a fish this big right
35:35 but if you were to fill up the frisbee
35:39 episode with nothing but left brainers
35:41 in that room they probably beat him
35:44 senseless because the screaming demon
35:47 chatter in their brain of abstract
35:49 thoughts will consume them but let's
35:52 look at a little bit of embellishment
35:55 and again just as a disclaimer I don't
35:57 try to embellish but I definitely have a
36:00 I think a more articulate
36:03 romantic side to the way that I will
36:06 recall a particular history because I
36:09 think that a left brain person starts to
36:11 defecate in their pants the second that
36:14 they hear romantic thought because in
36:16 their brain they never saw it in the
36:17 first place because they're too left to
36:20 see it and so their their data banks are
36:23 empty on the right side they think
36:26 you're committing a crime when I
36:30 guarantee you for any event that occurs
36:32 at 9/11 someone getting married someone
36:36 passing away in hospice with the family
36:38 around them
36:39 there is a predominant right brain
36:42 experience overlaying the minutiae of
36:44 the rules that create the moment the
36:48 physics that makes a building fall the
36:51 ring that slides on a ring finger and a
36:54 marriage certificate getting filled out
36:56 or in the case of death the death
36:59 certificate getting filled out the body
37:01 being taken away and a funeral
37:03 proceeding to push him into the ground
37:05 six feet what matters is the right brain
37:10 in the end because when you think about
37:13 3,000 people dying on a particular day
37:15 and the fact that it was done by a
37:18 neocon deep state with the help of their
37:21 alphabet agencies
37:23 isn't that infuriating what part of the
37:26 rule system makes you infuriated may be
37:30 that they said that the impossible
37:32 happened in physics but I guarantee the
37:34 people still hanging on to the lies of
37:37 that day are left brainers why do people
37:41 get married so they're gonna have sex
37:45 still gonna have kids it's like I have
37:48 companionship throughout a day why do
37:50 you have a child because the child
37:52 provides this river of right brain
37:56 creativity and love love is in left
37:59 brain love is right brain which is why
38:01 you'll have a really hard time getting
38:03 love out of a left brain person they are
38:07 robotic sometimes religion applies more
38:11 to a person of the left side because
38:13 they need a systematic system they have
38:16 to be told by someone else
38:17 [ __ ] think if they are to be put in
38:20 the void of their own thoughts they
38:23 scream like a child in the night when
38:28 someone passes away why is that a big
38:31 deal why do people fear death because
38:35 you have an emotional right side with
38:37 empathy that misses the person that's
38:39 why it is not a left brain problem
38:43 there's a right brain problem so you see
38:46 the difference the importance of the
38:49 left brain is miniscule but must exist
38:51 we must memorize and repeat things in
38:53 order to figure out how the world works
38:55 to supply our intelligence algorithms
38:57 with the values inside the variables
39:00 right X plus y equals Z right if you
39:04 don't put a value in action you don't
39:06 put a value in Y that is just a
39:07 theoretical concept and you'll never
39:09 solve for Z what's interesting to me
39:12 about The Stolen Valor because you could
39:15 take stolen valor of a soldier and talk
39:16 about any really embellished lie but the
39:19 interesting thing about the whole stolen
39:21 valor thing for me is that you have
39:24 people that obviously did not enlist in
39:26 the military or if they didn't served a
39:28 really short period of time they're
39:29 claiming usually a much higher
39:31 accomplishment now almost invariably
39:33 always go for Navy SEAL which is the
39:35 easiest agency to prove that you weren't
39:37 in and the fact that these guys don't
39:40 know how to put the patches on their
39:42 outfits they don't have match their
39:44 regulation boots with an up they wear
39:46 their cover or not they don't know their
39:49 MOS they don't know their their rank
39:53 possible right they don't know where
39:57 they went to basic where they were I
39:58 mean maybe they didn't know some of that
40:00 stuff but they will say they went all
40:02 the way through different you know first
40:04 I started out in the Navy then I went to
40:05 the army then I went to Marines unreal
40:09 but now here's the thing as much as we
40:12 all get revolted by that disgrace it's a
40:17 felony I guess since since 9/11 it's a
40:21 felony to be caught impersonating a
40:24 soldier I should talk to a guy who said
40:28 he was on military tribunals for 20
40:31 and he said I don't think it's a felony
40:33 so go look it up buddy but now let's say
40:36 someone did lack the courage or the
40:40 opportunity to join the military but
40:42 later on started been personating a
40:43 soldier especially one of Special Forces
40:46 Army Rangers Navy SEALs all this crazy
40:49 high-end stuff right you think about it
40:54 now some guys are getting gonna use it
40:55 to get a lot of money most of them do at
40:59 the really high level to go to a church
41:01 and say I'm a retired Navy SEAL and I've
41:03 got this speech and for $100 I'll talk
41:06 to you talk to your church on Sunday
41:08 really get to talk for free but they got
41:10 some website pulling cash out of people
41:13 all those folks should go to jail anyone
41:16 getting caught getting a discount and
41:18 wearing the uniform to get a discount at
41:20 the mall I don't give a [ __ ] if you're
41:22 saving 20 cents on the dollar there's a
41:25 prison cell for 30 days enjoy yourself
41:29 we'll see if you pull that number again
41:32 but the dopey guy who wishes he had
41:37 joined who wishes he had the heart of a
41:40 lion the courage of a lion I should say
41:43 because the heart was the Tin Man wasn't
41:46 it what do you think happens by them
41:49 sort of romanticizing things perhaps
41:55 they become what they are emulating now
42:00 we need people to be honest and have
42:03 integrity in this world so we don't want
42:05 to create a platform where allies start
42:07 occurring right it's a bit of a
42:09 difference between the romantic telling
42:10 of the truth and the truth right well I
42:14 don't know about your army but the
42:16 military personnel that comes out of the
42:18 United States Army is usually the most
42:20 behaved the most productive probably
42:23 some of the best employees you could
42:25 probably ever hire because they're gonna
42:26 get up on time they're gonna be
42:28 goal-oriented they're gonna execute that
42:30 goal to the best of their ability
42:31 they're gonna be team players and they
42:33 won't crack under pressure especially
42:35 the soldiers of today so you probably
42:37 couldn't do better today then fill up
42:39 your company with a bunch of these folks
42:41 but you have someone who is
42:44 ever been there but they understand the
42:45 basics of what these individuals go
42:48 through and let's just say someone was
42:50 imitating a soldier
42:52 well if as long as it wasn't a soldier
42:56 with a felony for wearing the clothes
42:57 out there and impersonating a military
43:00 person this is for terrorist reasons
43:01 right it's not to necessarily go for the
43:05 respect element of the whole thing then
43:07 you can't have people running around
43:08 pretending to be military just like you
43:09 can't go out and pretend to be a cop I'm
43:12 sure that's a felony right it's not it
43:15 should be but this person might end up
43:19 being more respectful might get up early
43:22 might just completely impersonate
43:24 everything they've seen in movies or
43:25 nothing else okay so it's not the best
43:28 method for them to gain that level of
43:31 performance in society but it's not the
43:33 worst either is it we gained a better
43:35 citizen because they have a hero and the
43:38 funny thing is is that they're looking
43:40 up to soldiers now I know that doesn't
43:43 work I don't know that we can't bend
43:44 that rule trust me
43:46 I'm just giving you an example because
43:48 in the normal world think about it
43:50 people have uncles and aunts grandmas
43:53 and grandpas and you will simply live a
43:56 better life a more respectable life
43:58 because you know that they're watching
43:59 you especially when they're alive of
44:00 course I always tell my friends who lose
44:04 relatives and they're a little disturbed
44:07 by the fact that their relative has
44:08 passed and you know sometimes it's like
44:12 I didn't see my parent or relative or
44:15 whatever for 10 to 20 years before they
44:16 passed and so I really feel bad I wasn't
44:19 there and I say well you know my
44:21 grandparents could never understand what
44:23 I actually did for a living for the most
44:25 of my career they knew what a video game
44:29 was but they never played one I mean
44:32 ever isn't that crazy
44:35 so I know when they passed because I
44:37 believe that they have the chance to
44:39 come see what I'm doing if they would
44:40 like that was the very first time that
44:42 they completely understood everything
44:44 that I had accomplished and everything
44:46 that I was going to accomplish they can
44:48 sit and watch me record this show as far
44:49 as I'm concerned right
44:51 I still behave today not with my naughty
44:55 mouth but I still behave today be
44:58 as I believe that those that were
45:00 watching me when I was alive
45:02 watch me even more today it doesn't
45:05 really matter to me if they're watching
45:06 or not I believe in the power of the
45:09 surname I believe that your word has to
45:13 have value otherwise you're nothing but
45:14 a nice affable calling wolf everywhere
45:17 but here's the thing for everyone
45:20 listening here okay
45:20 I think it would behoove you to study
45:25 yourself find out if you're a right
45:27 brain and left brain person I'm gonna
45:30 wager right off the bat that for those
45:32 of you who've listened to more than say
45:34 ten episodes and you're coming back
45:35 because you dig the content I assure you
45:37 okay you're towards the group or realm
45:40 because I'm a group or and it's hard for
45:42 a stringer to listen to a group or speak
45:44 but if you're brand-new and you've
45:46 graced me with your audience for a
45:49 couple episodes or maybe this is your
45:50 first you might indeed be predominantly
45:53 left brain right now
45:56 now let me give you a little zinger here
45:58 I have been right brain and left brain
46:03 my entire life because I was extremely
46:06 academic in my love of life and
46:08 extremely artistic in my love of life so
46:11 I would paint and read the encyclopedia
46:13 you know as a child at like nine nine
46:15 years old and up alright I used to do
46:19 electronics and I do programming and
46:21 then I would program a paint application
46:23 so I could paint the paintings on my
46:25 computer that I wanted I programmed a
46:27 keyboard into my computer so I could
46:28 learn how to read music and make music
46:30 in my computer it was a beautiful gödel
46:33 Escher Bach thing right I love music so
46:35 that took care of the the poetry thing
46:38 but when I went through the last I would
46:44 say 15 years of my computer program err
46:48 sorry video game side of life right I
46:50 went up into upper management had a
46:53 gigantic team a TA like 55 people I was
46:57 doing massive negotiations between like
47:00 Pepsi and EA and Apple and EA my own
47:04 game company just utterly blew up I mean
47:06 in five years we had generated 90% of
47:09 the income we were ever going to
47:10 generate
47:12 but I also met my writing mentor my
47:15 screenwriting mentor and I sat down with
47:19 him and he's one of my heroes in life
47:20 and you know it took him a while to
47:25 figure out who the hell I was our first
47:27 meeting together was seven hours long
47:29 and we just we just realized that we we
47:32 thought alike and he is very left and
47:34 right as well very very much so but
47:40 there was a point in the first year
47:42 where he said you know what he goes
47:43 you're way too pragmatic to be a writer
47:46 I was like what first I didn't quite
47:49 know what the word meant and he goes
47:51 well you're you're all about the rules
47:53 and and you're the kind of guy that felt
47:56 like we needed to describe what the
47:57 force was in Star Wars I was like man I
48:01 was I hate the fact they did that and he
48:03 goes but yeah but you're that kind of
48:04 guy this is you've lost yourself if you
48:07 ever were this other right brain person
48:09 and so I went home my game company's
48:13 raging at the time and I mean we're
48:14 making major major money okay it seems
48:19 like everything's going right but I went
48:22 home that night and I had to think it
48:23 through I was thinking well how if
48:27 that's true did I get that way and the
48:29 reason is because I became a manager a
48:33 director then I became the founder CEO
48:36 of my company and so I was always having
48:39 to execute the rules and keep the group
48:41 together
48:42 not that I'd still design video games
48:45 and draw them at the same time I was
48:49 running the company yes I did everything
48:52 I could never stop doing everything but
48:57 I was predominantly left at that point I
49:00 had abandoned my right side so it took
49:03 me a couple years to wake it back up
49:05 again and I just choked off the left and
49:09 went full bore right got back into my
49:12 painting got back into my writing got
49:13 back into everything but music to
49:16 everything but I found that when I its
49:21 the frisbee thing that I want to reflect
49:23 back on which
49:24 this guy that embellished and he lied
49:26 tremendously in his movies that he had
49:28 33 degrees or 30 different 33 different
49:31 universities that he developed the
49:32 actual ph.d doctorate programs I mean
49:35 this was hilarious it was it was totally
49:37 a comedy but what is life what is the
49:41 now how would you define the now there's
49:44 something called the hisin I was at the
49:46 Heisenberg uncertainty principle which
49:49 is a quantum physics rule that says that
49:53 you can either know the direction or the
49:55 velocity direction and velocity of a
49:57 particle or its position but you can't
50:00 you can't know both at the same time
50:02 okay so if I said okay describe for me
50:07 right now
50:08 the state of the world right now give
50:11 you the weather everything right now you
50:15 know that by the time you start speaking
50:16 then now that you are trying to define
50:18 has escaped you it has now changed by
50:22 the time you finish your sentence or any
50:23 description or paragraph thereof it is
50:26 no longer the way it was when you
50:28 started speaking the first part of the
50:29 sentence and so you cannot capture time
50:31 in a bottle
50:32 except for maybe to get a full picture
50:35 of it at once
50:37 how many times have you told a story
50:39 like this you're on vacation you come
50:42 back into the hotel or whatever you're
50:46 with your girlfriend your boyfriend your
50:48 parents along for the ride
50:50 and the parents say where have you guys
50:52 been and the boyfriend goes I'm just
50:55 picking him arbitrarily don't have a
50:57 conniption fit here's that we went down
50:59 the beach and laid out and then the girl
51:02 goes should be the opposite we hit but
51:04 the girl goes well you know technically
51:07 it went down and we've tried to rent a
51:10 bicycle and that didn't work out then we
51:12 went to lunch then we decided to ride
51:14 the surfboard so went and waited in line
51:16 15 minutes and then we went out of the
51:18 beach for approximately 43 minutes and
51:20 then now we're here right the stringer
51:24 has to go with the latter definition the
51:27 groupers like well when you asked me the
51:30 question of what we did today it would
51:34 be the thing that predominantly
51:35 dominated our schedule the
51:37 and it was our overall goal in the
51:39 system but is the gist of what you were
51:42 trying to gain from me in the answer yes
51:46 other things occurred I also peed twice
51:48 I also you know 842 you know corn nuts
51:54 right but nobody cares we have this
51:59 thing now called TMI what saddens me is
52:02 the conflict that can arise from this
52:05 this technical debate of things what
52:09 concerns me is that I don't want to live
52:11 in a world if everybody just went in
52:13 left brain and I'm the only right brain
52:15 on planet Earth I would put a [ __ ]
52:18 gun in my mouth and pull the trigger
52:19 right because it would just be a matter
52:22 of time before the Inquisition would
52:23 come and snatch me up for not following
52:25 the thx 1 1 3 8 lifestyle what if every
52:30 soldier in every country
52:34 we're to have their weapons taken away
52:37 they get a canvas a bunch of paint a
52:40 bunch of brushes bunch of nude people to
52:43 draw sports cars whatever or it's just
52:46 like hey you're and you're in class 1 do
52:49 it whatever you want
52:50 what would the world turn into we had
52:54 billions of artists here's your guitar
52:58 here's your piano here's some slippers
53:01 to dance in here's some tap shoes knock
53:03 yourself out
53:04 there's a soundstage right over there
53:06 have some fun hmm well that's a
53:11 ludicrous example isn't it I mean
53:13 that'll never ever happen in the world
53:15 well if you were a deep state
53:17 organization that wanted to have plenty
53:19 of soldiers plenty of minions on all
53:23 sides of the fence
53:24 and believe me soldiers are just the
53:26 tiniest tiniest group of folks that they
53:28 would refer to as cattle which is the
53:32 word they use for us being slaughtered
53:34 but they really want a ton of corporate
53:37 workers worker bees right come to work
53:40 do worker bee stuff make me money you
53:42 paid pittance go suffer somewhere die
53:45 cancer and I'll live forever because I'm
53:47 going to use adrenal Crohn's out of
53:50 Planned Parenthood right I want to
53:53 impose on you the notion but if you're
53:57 extremely right brain then maybe you
53:59 need a little left to organize the
54:00 success of your right brain creations
54:02 there's a lot of people that are amazing
54:05 creators that want to start a business
54:08 but can't start a business because they
54:10 were never taught any some of that
54:11 strategic in school again you could get
54:15 a harvard business degree at a no point
54:17 will you be able to point to the class
54:19 that K through K through PhD that
54:25 discuss compound interest and a credit
54:27 card those classes don't exist you're
54:30 never to be taught about usury in the
54:33 fashion that it applies to you you may
54:36 have a recursive algorithm in some math
54:38 class you'll never be attached to your
54:40 financial ruin a left brain person will
54:44 have rules that go against common law
54:46 and freedom of man and they'll never
54:49 notice a right brain person is the
54:51 person that looks at the abstract
54:53 meeting in the symbolism of losing
54:54 freedom no matter how you paraphrase it
54:59 indoctrinate it the left the right brain
55:02 person will look at that kind of thing
55:03 and go something's really wrong the
55:08 truth movement is largely infused with
55:11 right-brainers right-brainers are saving
55:13 the world if it is to be saved
55:15 perhaps left brainers are creating the
55:18 war plans to go get some of these folks
55:20 but in the end we need to bring them
55:21 into the middle middle ground at a
55:24 minimum and we owe it to ourselves so
55:26 for predominantly right brain to go a
55:27 little bit to the left
55:28 what this episode is about is the
55:30 religion by which we need to live the
55:33 disciplines that we agreed to to form
55:35 our brains right now if someone was in a
55:38 fishing contest and there's a big blue
55:41 ribbon for the biggest fish that if you
55:45 were to I don't know go somewhere and
55:48 buy a big fish off somebody and then
55:51 bring it to the contest hide it in the
55:53 water and say that you caught it and
55:56 somehow there's not judges watching you
55:57 to prove what you did you'd be stealing
56:00 first prize from someone else that may
56:04 spent a lifetime trying to figure out
56:06 how to lure that bigger fish and that is
56:08 indeed a crime and not something we want
56:10 to do but if your uncle comes in from
56:13 some fishing trip by himself because I
56:17 kind of finished this big and you go
56:18 where is it I already ate it I set it
56:20 back in there you know big fish don't
56:22 taste good some other embellished fact
56:26 what they should tell you is that your
56:28 uncle needs that he needs to embellish
56:31 because he needs to be the person that
56:33 he's impersonating what's the law that
56:36 we live by on this show common law
56:39 mm-hmm well what's what's at risk here
56:44 well Uncle Bob becomes a liar Uncle Bob
56:49 if he's willing to lie about a fish
56:50 maybe he's lying about a whole bunch of
56:52 stuff then you look at the overall image
56:55 of your uncle Bob and you say was he a
56:57 good man I mean is there a bunch of
56:59 girls disappearing and he could never
57:02 say where he is when that happens no
57:06 he's always there he's always for us but
57:11 he's a bit romantic with his life how
57:14 many times has art infected life
57:18 that again very specifically we're
57:21 talking about non criminal activity okay
57:23 we don't want to embellish criminal
57:25 activity to smooth it off to the point
57:28 it's not a criminal activity or the
57:30 horrors of which the crime created are
57:33 somehow marginalized or reduced I'm not
57:38 talking about any of that so keep your
57:39 mind in the fully legal wonderful world
57:42 of seeing us perhaps a space movie and
57:45 being inspired to get into space
57:47 research or science you see someone
57:51 travel around the world in a fictional
57:54 movie and you're like I'd like to do
57:57 that and so you do and you enlighten
58:00 yourself and you see things well I think
58:03 for some folks especially in the left
58:05 brain realm as long as you keep those
58:07 two concepts absolutely sequestered I am
58:13 NOT in a movie I am living in left brain
58:15 I am in a movie and I'm watching total
58:17 fiction
58:17 it's great and if I adopt something from
58:21 the right brain side into the left side
58:23 I must take it from a right brain
58:24 symbolistic beautiful experience that I
58:28 want to have and I realize it in the
58:31 left side I give an example of what some
58:34 of you have experienced and at least
58:37 most of you have heard of this happening
58:40 how many of you have relatives that go
58:42 on cruises that hop up and down a coast
58:46 or they go over to Europe for like two
58:49 weeks
58:50 my parents do this all time well they
58:54 usually say depending on what kind of
58:57 people they are well you know the first
59:00 time we went over we went on this tour
59:01 and it was just you know them telling us
59:05 where to go constantly right and I got
59:09 tired of being you know like spending
59:11 only five minutes in a place that I
59:12 loved and half an hour in a place that I
59:14 couldn't stand
59:15 I didn't control my money I spent you
59:19 know thirty five hundred bucks a head or
59:21 even more than that and I didn't enjoy
59:23 my vacation as much as I think I would
59:25 have so the second time I went back I
59:27 said screw that [ __ ] I just got a
59:31 rent-a-car found out where public
59:33 transportation was the metros the trains
59:35 the buses and we went where the hell we
59:37 wanted to go for as long as we wanted to
59:39 go if we went to a restaurant it suck
59:41 we'd leave we went to a museum that we
59:42 loved we stay there all day that's
59:45 typically you're smart folks I have
59:47 relatives that go over and they love
59:49 following the rules someone tells them
59:51 where to go constantly it's sort of a
59:54 North Korean tour of Europe you only get
59:57 to see what they show you because a lot
60:00 of these governments participate in the
60:01 tour construction by way of virtue of
60:04 promotion or approval you only see the
60:09 romanticized side of the country but you
60:13 will never get an accurate gist of what
60:15 the country is about because you'll
60:17 never see it you never see the bride in
60:20 the dark at the same time right a lot of
60:23 people are lured to Jamaica and one of
60:25 the things that Westerners always say
60:27 when they go to Jamaica is god I was so
60:29 excited to be there but when we took the
60:31 bus
60:31 from the airport to this Club Med place
60:34 where we stayed the whole time we saw
60:36 the true poverty of Jamaica and it was
60:39 disturbing have relative that was just
60:42 shaken by the level of poverty and
60:46 suffering that was going on in whatever
60:48 route they took from the airport to
60:50 wherever they were going now maybe
60:52 that's simply their impression that is
60:55 actually fine those people are happy but
60:57 by their students they were horrified
60:59 now everyone also knows positive people
61:02 and negative people and of course you
61:04 know the gradients in between as well
61:07 when someone suffers in a particular
61:10 moment in time and they perhaps shared
61:14 the experience with someone else or
61:15 someone else perhaps I don't know read
61:17 about it or something and they recall it
61:19 and they get some technicalities wrong
61:24 it is it represents pain for them how
61:29 dare you skip something or get something
61:32 wrong because that little mistake in
61:35 your recollection of the story means
61:39 that you're glossing over something bad
61:40 that occurred now let's say that you're
61:44 describing something like Christmas and
61:48 it's a joyous occasion
61:50 it's a phoner it's a really good one
61:51 right you know I'm sorry for anyone
61:53 who's not Christian or didn't celebrate
61:55 Christmas insert birthday or whatever
61:57 party you had a party but everyone in
62:01 Christmas is awesome everyone's getting
62:03 a gift and certain ones in there a
62:04 little microcosm of just absolutely
62:06 forea hopefully right and if someone
62:09 recalls that particular day and
62:11 embellishes something because perhaps
62:13 they don't know exactly what you were
62:15 doing or what Dad was doing but dad
62:17 showed up and I Santa Claus outfit so
62:19 you made up the fact that he went
62:20 upstairs and got into the Santa Claus
62:22 outfit and you know one of your siblings
62:24 goes well you don't know that you're
62:27 like what you don't know they went to
62:29 the bat a bedroom to put that on maybe
62:31 went to the bathroom maybe did it in the
62:33 garage and you're kind of going what
62:36 [ __ ] differences of me he came out
62:39 and the gist of what I'm saying is the
62:41 dad came out in a
62:42 and a Santa Claus outfit didn't you like
62:44 oh I totally love the experience well
62:46 stop busting my [ __ ] balls about
62:48 where dad put on the goddamn outfit
62:50 would you write this is an archetype of
62:53 the problems that we have in
62:55 communicating across the river sometimes
62:56 between the left brain and the right
62:58 brain but that indifference that we have
63:02 that that difference that we have I
63:04 should probably say gets completely
63:06 fixed once we start all merging in the
63:11 center for people who suffer from major
63:13 stress like I always say on the show I
63:16 usually find it in people that are
63:18 predominantly left brain the most left
63:21 brain person ever dated in my life
63:22 suffered from panic attacks religion was
63:26 the left brain process now this person
63:29 had the capacity to feel loved at a
63:33 beautiful maxim of capability but it was
63:39 facilitated only by the left brain
63:41 interpretation of Jesus Christ's left
63:45 brain interpretation of how the world
63:46 works and so naturally a divided
63:50 starting occurring between the two of us
63:53 now what I find as well and and what
63:56 reason want giving you all these
63:57 examples is because I want you to know
64:00 the problems you can run into when you
64:02 become an extremist of one or the other
64:05 the kid who lives in the basement of his
64:08 parents house doesn't have a job that
64:11 doesn't give a [ __ ] there's a super
64:13 right brain person hey man that's just
64:17 your opinion man right and then your
64:20 extreme left brain person has never been
64:22 in control of their life despite their
64:25 intent to follow all the rules now they
64:29 may be technically in control their life
64:30 but they're not really in control they
64:32 never had a destiny they feel that
64:33 emptiness inside of which a man and
64:35 woman is programmed to follow and that
64:40 creates the sense of powerless feeling
64:43 when you feel powerless you will tend to
64:47 gravitate to anything that gives you the
64:49 sense of what you do not have which is
64:50 that power why do left brain people tend
64:54 to show up to
64:57 homeowners associations politics PTA
65:03 meetings when you were a kid because
65:07 they are trying to gain some sense of
65:09 authority over something because they
65:12 have none over themselves
65:14 Seraphin adult and you're too much one
65:17 way or the other I would encourage you
65:20 to try to round out your brain I'm going
65:23 to tell you right off the bat that those
65:24 that are more right brain groupers are
65:26 gonna have less interest in becoming
65:28 more academic and the reason why is that
65:31 they will find themselves extremely
65:32 compatible with life and find no need
65:35 for it they also run their lives and
65:37 feel and control themselves and so they
65:39 don't want to lose that all right the
65:43 most right brain people also want to
65:45 know how the world works and so part of
65:47 the intoxication for the right brainer
65:49 in the truth movement is to say well you
65:52 want to know why buildings fell freefall
65:53 and you need to learn the basic physics
65:55 of why that is impossible and so your
65:57 research you want to know why NASA is
65:59 lying and how they've lied so your
66:01 research that is your exercise into the
66:05 left brain very healthy for you for the
66:09 right brain person they have a sense of
66:12 futility when I teach art I find this a
66:14 lot right teach anything creative people
66:15 will say I'm so I'm not creative I
66:18 couldn't do anything they have a fear of
66:20 failing because that's all you've ever
66:22 done in their mind deep down inside this
66:25 fail fail fail again they could have the
66:28 Bentley the car on the house on the
66:30 beach and a big high-paying job with the
66:33 wife and the kids or vice versa
66:35 husband and the kids but at no time do
66:38 they fill for feel for fill done excuse
66:40 me and so the last thing they want to do
66:44 is buy an instrument and fail at
66:47 learning it if they do buy an instrument
66:50 a lot of times they go back into a right
66:52 brain execution of the instrument they
66:54 become a recital pianist
66:59 that's all he can play write your own
67:01 song
67:02 what do you mean write my own song we'll
67:03 write your own song well how to do that
67:05 we'll start playing until something
67:08 sounds good
67:09 remember that you need to your big right
67:11 brainer you read music write it down and
67:13 your music sheets then figure out how
67:16 that song makes you feel the melody the
67:21 a and the B of the song right and then
67:24 write lyrics that match the way that
67:25 makes you feel but make sure you feel
67:28 those lyrics well those you'll never
67:29 sing them with passion and the song will
67:31 never be picked up by the cultures of
67:33 the world you know I think the
67:36 star-spangled banner'
67:37 the national anthem of America is the
67:41 most beautiful lyrics and music ever
67:45 married together into a single song but
67:49 then I learned it was actually an old
67:51 beer song out of a tavern I believe in
67:55 the UK somewhere and someone just
67:59 changed the lyrics and polished up the
68:01 music okay whoever wrote that song way
68:05 back in the tavern days had something to
68:07 say and that's why the melody in the
68:10 song made it so far through history that
68:13 it became the national anthem of the
68:15 United States of America and when you
68:17 understand what America had to do to
68:18 fight off England and the monarchies it
68:22 becomes a very touching song people died
68:25 people died by the millions to make this
68:28 place happen which then gave Europe its
68:30 freedom from the monarchy which is what
68:31 the deep States trying to reverse with
68:33 globalism right you know and we talked
68:36 about I just want to put a footnote here
68:37 because I can't do a whole episode on it
68:39 Americans no matter when your family
68:41 came over they could have come over or
68:44 50 years ago through Europe let's just
68:46 say it's only white people that tend to
68:48 feel this guilt of course but we took
68:51 this land from the Native Americans no
68:53 doubt about it and so there's that sort
68:57 of underground guilt even though none of
69:00 our families owned slaves none of our
69:01 family potentially ever heard a Native
69:04 American ever some of our family married
69:06 Native Americans but we still feel that
69:10 guilt
69:11 and I would say nothing's going to
69:14 abolish that feeling or that crime in
69:17 history but if you think about the
69:22 byproduct of the sacrifice the first
69:26 time that man recaptured freedom or any
69:28 sense of it and of course there's also
69:30 the obvious left-brain or correction to
69:34 this one thing I'm saying which is we're
69:35 not really free man okay we know but
69:38 we're the freest that it gets I say
69:41 we're the freeze to guess with
69:42 prosperity attached to it right
69:45 sure Europeans take more vacations but
69:47 then go ask what a Frenchman pays in
69:49 taxes and tell me how free that is
69:51 they're trying to correct the problem
69:54 so the Native Americans sacrificed
69:57 through force obviously they're a very
70:01 regrettable process their existence on
70:04 this continent for the most part such
70:08 that the Europeans could free themselves
70:10 from the tyranny that they allowed to be
70:12 created in the first place it's a
70:15 horrible thing now what did I just do
70:18 I romanticize the loss of the date of
70:22 Americans but now let's just say I I die
70:26 I go to this little heaven place for a
70:28 little while the little green room
70:29 before we come back down and I sit down
70:32 with all of the Native American Chiefs
70:36 I'm gonna romanticize this is a
70:39 continuation of the process but I talked
70:42 to them after they've had a chance to
70:44 see what the world was doing because all
70:46 knowledge of the world was gifted to
70:48 them in death and they might have say
70:54 they might say oh they might yeah they
70:56 might say in the future future tense
71:00 well if the Masons who came over who
71:07 didn't want to have anything to do with
71:08 the moneychangers of Europe and the
71:10 monarchies that were subjugated to the
71:12 moneychangers through all kinds of
71:14 shenanigans if they had come over to
71:19 America
71:21 and they brought their tyranny then my
71:26 people would most likely not just live
71:28 on reservations which is also
71:29 regrettable in product but they probably
71:32 would have been slaves with everyone
71:34 else and if the Native Americans proved
71:37 to be stronger than the Africans or the
71:40 Europeans maybe they would have been
71:41 allowed to be the predominant race to
71:43 plow the fields work the corporations
71:45 and do whatever those controlling
71:48 tarrant tyrannical monarchies would have
71:51 had them do right we often talk about on
71:55 this show that were symbiotic beings
71:57 right I say we because the conversation
72:00 goes like wildfire on Facebook and
72:02 YouTube for those of you coming in
72:04 through audio well what would be the
72:07 left brain interpretation of the human
72:09 form it would be the critical definition
72:11 of a human being where a bag of
72:13 chemicals we live in a machine it tells
72:15 us what we can and can't do right 100
72:18 pound woman is never gonna benchpress
72:20 450 pounds 250 pound guy will benchpress
72:24 600 pounds that's the left brain
72:31 definition of our being but when you
72:33 listen to Hindus they have said for
72:36 millennia you are not your body you are
72:40 not your mind you are your spirit or
72:44 your soul now let's think about this
72:48 what part of you ceases to exist at some
72:52 point your machine your left brain
72:55 interpretation of what you are is the
72:57 temporary apparatus that you're using to
73:00 experience whatever it is you think
73:02 you're experiencing in this world what
73:05 part of you lives forever your soul your
73:08 organized energy not electrons or ether
73:12 all matter but your organizing energy
73:14 that is you goes on forever because it
73:17 could never be destroyed and it can
73:19 never be hidden away from you and you
73:23 still exist why do left brain people
73:27 believe in death is final because they
73:31 see this machine governed by the rules
73:34 of this universe
73:35 deteriorates and diffuse into the soil
73:38 behind me right and so they assume
73:42 probably greatly inaccurately if I'm a
73:46 butcher of the English language that
73:49 you're so also diffuses out of any
73:51 identity an organization that is you
73:54 well the only reason why diffusion
73:56 happens in chemistry is that two things
73:58 are interacting and causing effects and
74:01 changes between the two of them they
74:03 blend together they distribute evenly
74:06 well if you know if you put a drop of
74:08 red dye in a big glass of water that's
74:10 clear it turns a little bit pink the red
74:14 dye is still in there it's just not what
74:16 it was there's no reason to believe that
74:19 the sole is by any means destroyed by
74:23 the body's lack of existence how does
74:28 one understand that you must have an
74:30 abstract mind the burial ritual of
74:33 mankind is a sign that man has
74:35 intelligence because it shows the
74:38 spirituality of man to believe in an
74:40 afterlife that is why there is a burial
74:43 ritual look at the Egyptians they had
74:47 the most developed burial procedure of
74:50 any culture that has ever existed in
74:53 history the embalming process putting
74:56 each organ of the body into little tiny
74:58 jars the acquisitions of objects that
75:04 are buried with the Pharaoh such that he
75:06 could have his the spirit of his animals
75:09 the spirit of sometimes his wife's with
75:12 him his servants would die with him in
75:16 some cases they would paint on the walls
75:20 of a tomb unlike the pyramids a king you
75:25 know hunting in the afterlife they carve
75:28 it into walls and in relief surrounded
75:32 by the hieroglyphs that describe his
75:34 journey in the afterlife they developed
75:36 a god Anubis to take you over the river
75:38 Styx to usher you to the new world did
75:44 that come out of the left brain society
75:46 no I came out of a right brain society
75:50 but what methodology recorded it in
75:52 stone the left side think about painting
75:58 I paint I paint a lot here and there I
76:01 go through bursty things right I'm more
76:04 into creative projects now like
76:06 three-dimensional sculptures of things
76:07 or something but you have to have the
76:13 left brain to be able to execute you
76:16 know mixing paints and getting to the
76:18 shade that you want it to cut a piece of
76:20 wood in a way that when painted will
76:22 look proper so you've all your smarts
76:26 then you have a little bit of wisdom of
76:28 how to use those tools because you know
76:29 they say this does this but it doesn't
76:31 use the different grit of sandpaper than
76:33 they say keys or get much better results
76:34 right but in order to come up with the
76:38 entire concept you must be right brained
76:41 you'll hear me say a lot on the show and
76:43 I would suggest that you start using
76:44 this as well a three-dimensional
76:47 experience so much more
76:48 three-dimensional experience what I mean
76:51 by that is not an XYZ Cartesian
76:54 coordinate you know world coordinate
76:57 system what I mean by that is that you
76:59 are basically adding more dimensions on
77:01 to any moment of wisdom that is
77:05 occurring to you try to make your life
77:08 as three-dimensional as possible
77:10 try and see all sides of all things if
77:13 you are a parent here's a little trick
77:17 buy art supplies buy anything that's
77:21 creative and don't make the mistake that
77:24 I made which is to encourage your child
77:26 to use the equipment just leave it all
77:28 over the house and then cease to satiate
77:32 them with $2,000 cellphones and $1,000
77:36 game consoles with $500 worth of games
77:39 if they want that stuff well tell them
77:42 to go get a job pay them to do something
77:45 around the house something but maybe
77:49 you'll find that they won't need those
77:50 things a second they've got a skate ramp
77:54 some method of being creative creating
77:57 their own clothes painting graffiti on
77:59 themselves whatever it is put makeup on
78:01 getting crazy
78:03 when I was a kid there was a band called
78:05 kiss which I've been mentioning a lot
78:07 lately they're about to do this
78:08 three-year world final world tour it's
78:11 just phenomenal but what did they do
78:14 they played music which is right-brain
78:16 and then they dressed up in these
78:18 costumes now we had some people wearing
78:22 makeup here and there was 1973 these
78:25 guys took it to a whole new level that
78:27 has never been dared to be completely
78:29 copied since now there's a bunch of
78:31 folks that dress up like Leatherface and
78:34 clowns and [ __ ] so but the course they
78:36 had to take it in a super dark place
78:38 welcome to children of the 90s but when
78:42 I was a kid we put on the kiss makeup
78:45 and they kept us creative we would act
78:49 out in our closets by playing the music
78:51 really loud in the room we'd knock open
78:53 the doors like the stage was opening up
78:55 and we'd use
78:56 Afghans and towels and [ __ ] all over us
78:58 and pretend to have capes and play the
79:01 guitar and all this stuff
79:02 it was absolutely hilarious and sort of
79:05 embarrassing as an adult when you look
79:07 back but you know that's what made you
79:08 what you are rounded so if I can pass
79:13 you a little bit of what I learned from
79:14 those cassette tapes as a kid relax a
79:18 little bit survey yourself
79:21 there's no room or need for any type of
79:24 punishment for you finding out you're
79:26 one way or the other predominantly one
79:27 way or the other this is all about the
79:29 now getting control of your life
79:32 massaging who you are now is the
79:35 infinite point in time I really think in
79:39 my heart of hearts that for at least a
79:42 millennia if not 50 the Egyptians had
79:46 figured out the most euphoric way of
79:48 living you know when I was a kid they
79:51 used to tell us that slaves built
79:52 everything in Egypt and I'm sure there
79:54 were some servants and there were some
79:57 people in charge I'm sure the Pharaohs
79:58 resembled in some way shape or form the
80:00 monarch that we have today - perhaps the
80:02 taxation but if you study Egyptology
80:05 which you will find is that the corpses
80:08 of those that were the workers average
80:11 life I believe was 75
80:14 average corpse of a pharaoh - King Tut
80:18 was in the 90s everyone died with their
80:21 teeth by the way the Charter of this
80:23 shows to rebuild the world from the
80:25 ground up right there's a lot of systems
80:28 out there that you can use some are
80:30 called religions some are just called
80:33 like business courses or business
80:36 schools that go on for a long time they
80:38 can keep you in their classes for 10
80:39 years and those are methods as well that
80:43 work for people who didn't have the
80:46 inspirational people around them to
80:48 teach them methodologies to deal with
80:50 the mind that's sort of what I'm trying
80:52 to do here in a very loose and abstract
80:55 and right-brained way one of the things
80:59 that you know I'll just mention before
81:00 closing here the opening episode of
81:02 season 3 is about Bigfoot and I have
81:05 never like I said in the episode really
81:07 had much of an interest in Bigfoot
81:08 because I just think it's a very
81:12 unsubstantiated thing while I was in the
81:16 episode what occurred to me and had
81:18 never occurred to me before is basically
81:20 the mating process and the birthing
81:23 process of a fellow Sasquatch would
81:27 change the entire narrative of
81:29 everything anyone's ever said that they
81:31 have discovered about these these beings
81:33 there's never any mating ritual where
81:35 someone is howling in the middle of the
81:37 night you know with the big giant
81:38 hominid skull to say I want sex right
81:42 even crickets sit there and go nuts like
81:43 that squirrel over there was bothering
81:45 me during the show was looking for his
81:46 thing the hummingbird over there was
81:48 looking for his mate right and then the
81:52 birthing process would be very fragile
81:54 this creature would be borne by a biped
81:57 and therefore not ready to engage the
81:59 universe for at least a few months thus
82:03 requiring a nest and be making it very
82:06 simple to find these creatures but none
82:09 of that exists does it I wouldn't have
82:13 found that those associations within the
82:16 episode without approaching the left
82:18 from a right brain thinking process
82:19 right again I've talked about technology
82:23 where I simplified technology at a great
82:25 level by coming at it from
82:27 bring perspective and making a left
82:29 brain reality my buddy my buddy Syd Mead
82:31 is the futurist artist you know what he
82:33 did the the aircraft carrier looking
82:36 ship in Tron 1982 he came at it from a
82:41 right brain perspective looked at a
82:42 bunch of aircraft carriers drew a bunch
82:44 of them and then took one and tipped on
82:45 its side and they made another deck on
82:48 top creating an l-shaped deck that
82:52 became a left brain creation from a
82:54 right brain thinker he's balanced he has
82:57 both sides of his brain well intact and
83:01 that's what I want for every single one
83:02 of you because I think it will make the
83:04 world a wonderful place by making each
83:06 one of your individual lives far more
83:08 fulfilling you'll never have the need to
83:11 control someone else with a doctrine
83:13 ation because you will be fulfilled in
83:15 yourself if there's a little bit of
83:17 embellishment when history is recapped
83:19 as long as it does no harm maybe you can
83:23 take a poop and relax right anyhow if
83:28 you haven't been to deep thoughts
83:29 radio.com please go
83:31 it has audio and videos so for those
83:33 coming in a video you can switch to
83:34 audio in your car there's a lock
83:36 facebook group and a patreon page and a
83:38 store we now put up a Twitter page as
83:40 well it's one of our listeners Kaz thank
83:43 you so much for preserving that for the
83:46 couple of years before we had interest
83:48 in using it I finally found some of the
83:50 uses for Twitter accounts because some
83:53 people really love that feed bit anyway
83:56 take care of yourself and someone else
83:57 and I'll see you in the next deep
83:58 thoughts over now
84:00 [Music]
84:15 okay
84:17 that noise is a hummingbird in a really
84:24 weird flying loop
84:26 dude he's doing this
84:35 Jesus I've seen hummingbirds my whole
84:38 life and I have never ever seen anything
84:40 like that in my day I think they're in
84:43 some mating sequence feels like spring
