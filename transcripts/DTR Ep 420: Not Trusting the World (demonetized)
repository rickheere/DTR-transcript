00:29 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:31 deep thoughts today we're gonna discuss
00:34 something I think that comes up a lot
00:37 for all of us both on a personal level
00:40 and in your conversations with friends
00:43 and family who are sort of on the cusp
00:45 of waking up or they've gone through
00:47 that first phase of whatever it was that
00:50 made them start to doubt their world
00:55 right now the working title for this
00:58 would be not trusting the world it might
01:02 be a little might be I'll find a better
01:03 way to say that it's a hell of a thing
01:07 to to grow up isn't it and to realize
01:12 that that old adage you know I've been a
01:15 whole episode about it the victors of
01:17 war get the right to history books
01:20 that's not what this is about this is
01:23 gonna be much more fundamental to that
01:24 whole thing I made an episode called
01:26 crap science I guess 278 but he's got a
01:32 friend of a friend of mine we got a
01:34 conversation tonight and it just very
01:36 briefly touched on the whole thing of
01:39 she asked me she said you know are you a
01:41 flat earther and I said well no because
01:43 of expanding earth but I totally respect
01:46 those that are trying to find the end of
01:49 that rabbit hole and I got my rabbit
01:54 hole shirt on my buddy made but it's
01:58 hard it's hard to say okay don't believe
02:01 them believe this other group or believe
02:04 me or whatever and it's one of these
02:09 situations where I just watched the Star
02:12 Trek episode 18 season three and it's
02:17 all about Captain Picard is is kidnapped
02:23 and put inside this room with eventually
02:25 three other beings three different races
02:28 and it goes around a circle where they
02:30 don't know why they're there they don't
02:31 know who their captors are and
02:37 the hit to a point where they start
02:38 getting to that suspicion circle right
02:40 where they keep blaming each other for
02:42 everything that's going you're the
02:43 captor now you're the captor well you've
02:44 said this well you did that you're
02:46 ordering everyone else around you're
02:48 this you're that and eventually they
02:49 said three of them getting up
02:52 intellectually on Picard and they say
02:54 we'll prove who you are and we'll you
02:57 know will believe you and he says I
02:59 can't and it's one of those old logic
03:04 problems of you can't prove things in
03:08 some contexts and so you know I
03:15 mentioned this because it's we need some
03:18 guiding principles of thought when it
03:22 comes to how we form a vision of the
03:26 world that we're in because we tend to
03:29 only manifest details in areas where we
03:33 care if you don't care about some who
03:36 cares if somebody says you know f1
03:39 racing is completely fake I'm making
03:40 that up if someone goes well I don't
03:43 care I don't care there's the guy that
03:46 wrote the book the fixes in and he says
03:48 all organized professional sports around
03:50 the world are just they're orchestrated
03:54 not like WWF where every single moves on
03:57 a on a notepad somewhere and they're you
03:59 know they have to be in the right place
04:00 at the right time to make every maneuver
04:02 work no it's not like that it's just
04:04 they know how to curb opportunity they
04:07 know how to call plays such that other
04:09 teams can beat them or they get beat by
04:14 them and the guy talks about you know
04:17 legacy situations that have gone on for
04:19 50 to 70 years where referees were you
04:24 know roughed up by the mob at one point
04:26 and then you know once the jig is up and
04:29 you bust the mob for something well it
04:31 doesn't mean the crime stops you know
04:33 the CIA II studied the mob for 10 years
04:35 from 1949 to 1959 and then they took
04:39 over the industry of drug trade and
04:41 liquefied their pockets with all kinds
04:43 of untraceable cash okay so we tend to
04:49 only build up
04:50 leave systems and what we care about
04:52 what we're concerned about and so to
04:56 that degree of curiosity or perhaps in
05:01 some cases pain we find more truth let's
05:09 just say if we explore something than if
05:12 we didn't explore anything at all we try
05:16 to solve problems and sometimes problems
05:18 really exist and sometimes they don't
05:20 the problems can be inserted into your
05:23 mind out of thin air and it's really
05:28 it's really interesting
05:31 sometimes it's super unfortunate
05:33 sometimes it's the mechanism you use to
05:35 trick your mind into getting something
05:37 that you want you know you need to work
05:39 out you know you need to work harder at
05:43 your business so maybe you put up some
05:47 picture of something in your life that
05:49 is a ramification a good result of
05:52 completing your goal yeah you know if
05:55 you're a guy maybe put up a beautiful
05:57 girl and on your wall is someone you're
05:59 never gonna meet but at least inspires
06:01 you to work out because you're like if I
06:03 get really tight at least my appearance
06:05 will provide the opportunity and if I
06:07 get my character together I'm you know I
06:10 can have a good conversation if you're a
06:13 business person maybe it's a picture of
06:16 a beach in Malibu it's a car it's
06:18 something maybe it's all the above
06:21 and so you manifest these things and you
06:24 develop solutions to get to your goal
06:28 well truth is a goal it's a big one what
06:34 we're probably most like if you woke up
06:38 to something and you just don't have
06:41 knowledge about it
06:42 no one's keeping you from knowledge
06:44 let's just say quite the opposite you
06:48 buy books you research that you watch
06:50 YouTube videos you do everything else
06:51 you can maybe you go to college and get
06:53 a degree in it you get your undergrad
06:57 from one college you get your graduate
06:59 degree from another one and you go get
07:00 your PhD from a third one just to really
07:02 round out your thinking
07:04 there you go you have institutions and
07:09 individuals and all kinds of different
07:10 opinions giving you their ideas I don't
07:13 know how you go to college today with
07:15 science unless you're in something again
07:17 like a chemistry science where if it
07:21 works if they're lying to you it just
07:23 won't work that's a beautiful thing
07:25 about chemistry but there's still some
07:28 physics underneath chemistry which are
07:31 able to make accurate predictions but
07:33 what they're telling you is the cause
07:35 and effect of the models that are
07:37 creating those reactions and then they
07:40 don't quite have it right but it's okay
07:41 sorta you can still get all of your
07:43 upper tier science figured out because
07:47 you know the atom will behave a
07:50 particular way what the atom is made out
07:51 of well that's something that doesn't
07:53 need to be discerned at the necessarily
07:56 at the chemistry level I mean you could
08:00 as long as an electrons their loans a
08:02 neutron or proton are there you're good
08:04 to go
08:05 whether it's made by an ether a wind
08:07 current or some just a micro quarks or
08:12 you know whatever it doesn't matter it's
08:15 gonna work for you but that's nothing
08:18 that we're really concerned about is it
08:21 we're concerned about being lied to in
08:24 ways that will misguide us into hurting
08:27 ourselves and potentially hurting others
08:29 worried about being misguided in a way
08:31 that we won't get our destinies and
08:33 neither will our children we don't want
08:36 to be sick we want to believe that man
08:39 has achieved things in this world
08:43 because if we haven't achieve something
08:46 then we and we still want to achieve it
08:49 but we've been told we already did it
08:51 then we may not have any lust for it and
08:54 then it never gets done and then at some
08:57 point the perfect storm occurs and we
09:01 need to have that technology figured out
09:05 and so we go to our authorities and say
09:09 man we need that technology right now to
09:11 save humanity and they're like
09:13 it's classified well hey this is the end
09:16 of humanity and all the chains are off
09:18 right it's a matter of national security
09:20 is the famous mantra of the impress er
09:25 and that was in an episode in season 3
09:28 as well with picard saying that in his
09:32 he was like 7 16 or 17 episode when we
09:39 don't believe our leaders and when we
09:42 especially law enforcement and military
09:45 go along with that mantra because that
09:48 is what they are torn down more so the
09:50 military you're torn down to your basic
09:53 human instincts and you rebuilt up and
09:56 for the most part they make a better
09:57 human out of you you can do things that
10:00 you never thought you could do and so
10:04 you're empowered but if you are also
10:09 conditioned to always give it up to
10:12 Authority then they can feed you crap
10:15 constantly in this world we typically
10:20 respond to rewards for things that we do
10:22 correctly and most the time we're
10:24 isolated when we do it again you eat
10:27 well then you get healthy and then you
10:29 look in the mirror and you wake up but
10:30 you got a lot of energy and you just
10:31 look the way you want to look that's
10:33 something completely by yourself you
10:36 learn to be a nice person you don't step
10:38 on people's heads despite anything
10:39 you've been told or any examples around
10:41 you and then all the sudden people want
10:43 to be with you people you want to be
10:46 with because you have integrity others
10:51 are rewarded by something called loyalty
10:54 now loyalty is important when you have
10:56 integrity but if you have no integrity
10:57 loyalty can be probably one of the most
11:00 dangerous capacities that human being
11:02 can have you were loyal to the Clintons
11:06 and so you murder people and you feel
11:08 good about yourself because they're
11:09 loyal to you and you got power and you
11:11 got juice and you can get anything done
11:13 in the world
11:14 that's bad loyalty I sat and watched the
11:19 the YouTube channel that that does the Q
11:23 & on decodes
11:25 and this dude is a complete [ __ ]
11:27 fruitcake chill if you have ever seen
11:31 one in your goddamn life
11:32 I mentioned him in a previous episode I
11:35 think I got it in the Epstein episode
11:38 but this guy is a [ __ ] crackpot he's
11:43 either clinically [ __ ] insane or he
11:45 is the biggest goddamn shill ever to
11:48 keep this human on thing going if I was
11:51 queueing on I would disown this [ __ ]
11:53 in two seconds and he's usually pretty
11:56 good about disowning folks that blow
12:00 smoke but this guy always comes up with
12:02 the big Pro cueing on nothing has ever
12:05 been done wrong on their side everything
12:07 is perfect but this is the guy that you
12:10 know says the Trump says words at
12:13 specific seconds from broadcast network
12:15 clips of him being interviewed and it's
12:17 like you know the Edit guy in the
12:19 editing Bay is not trying to time the
12:20 word on the perfect second I mean these
12:23 people don't even know each other but
12:25 today I guess so goddamn ludicrous and
12:27 I'm mentioning this for a very specific
12:28 reason he took a Comey article about
12:33 Trump and the dude laughs [ __ ]
12:37 literally he inspected the web page
12:40 figured out that the graphic on I guess
12:43 the desktop because if it has responsive
12:46 layout it'll be a different size and of
12:48 the graphic but he had a certain number
12:50 of horizontal and and vertical pixels
12:52 and he tried to put that we put it
12:55 through his numerology calendar her
12:57 calculator and it was not enough and so
13:00 he goes well if you just add 1,200 to it
13:02 and it's just all [ __ ] and I mention
13:08 that because a lot of people think they
13:09 have this source queue and on it's not
13:11 going to tell them any lies well right
13:13 away even if you believe everything
13:15 about you and on this is not gonna be a
13:17 queuing on episode but doesn't he
13:19 represent the revolution at this point
13:21 and you know he's not saying this stuff
13:25 to his defense but he does provide
13:28 disinformation he's predicted a bunch of
13:30 stuff or thrown a bunch of caution up or
13:33 told you there's going to be a boom boom
13:34 boom event and nothing [ __ ] happens
13:36 or he tries to say that you
13:38 since you got to grocery bags today
13:40 instead of one that was one of the booms
13:42 right
13:43 but what Hemisphere's do we have in
13:47 terms of trying to find the truth you've
13:51 got fake news
13:52 I mean fake news is everything every
13:55 newspaper every magazine everything on
13:57 the internet that is a national or
14:00 international news network it's all fake
14:04 it is absolute Hollywood it's wag the
14:07 dog Times wag the dog I mean it is
14:09 unbelievable and this episode is going
14:13 to air considerably after these
14:16 particular events occurred so bear that
14:19 in mind
14:21 so your official source of information
14:23 is crap the revolution gets co-opted so
14:27 fast isn't even funny and it would you
14:31 don't be a full time job I think for I
14:33 mean actually no it's actually not so
14:35 not so bad let's say you're a picky
14:38 eater you can ask a picky eater what do
14:42 you like to you know like you want to
14:44 find out what they what they can eat you
14:45 say tell me everything that you don't
14:47 like well that list is gonna be a mile
14:49 long so it's easier to ask what do you
14:51 like and what do you eat and where do
14:54 you eat so that you can satisfy this
14:56 pain in the [ __ ] ass person some
15:01 people default back to religion because
15:04 they think oh my god this is God's realm
15:06 it is completely [ __ ] sanitized no
15:09 human beings on earth have the have the
15:12 physical capability of changing a word
15:14 in the Bible if you try to change in the
15:17 word in the Bible God will strike you
15:19 down dead and they'll find you in the
15:21 printing press all [ __ ] fried up and
15:23 the lightning bolt went through the
15:24 building and fragged your body and
15:26 that's how God works oh wait he doesn't
15:29 work like that at all
15:31 you can make up whatever you want and if
15:33 a bunch of people are dumb enough to
15:34 follow it we're ignorant enough to
15:36 follow it
15:37 God rolls like that he does we know it
15:41 for a fact you know a Christian thinks
15:44 that every other religion is going to
15:46 put you in hell they do and they'll blow
15:49 a bunch of smoke up your ass that they
15:50 don't believe that but they do
15:52 in fact within their own religion they
15:54 they will say oh man you break any of
15:56 these rules you don't do this X number
15:58 of [ __ ] times you're gonna go to hell
15:59 oh okay
16:02 and why is that again why my why are we
16:04 how [ __ ] destined for hell just at
16:07 the [ __ ] Gekko of religion
16:09 well because of original sin mm-hmm
16:13 who told you that happened the serpent
16:16 the devil he's in the first [ __ ]
16:19 paragraph for the first goddamn chapter
16:21 of the Bible not literally but almost
16:23 right he's right in the [ __ ] story
16:25 brothers man extorts heaven to man yeah
16:30 that's how God works yeah I'm gonna put
16:32 a bunch of [ __ ] PTO's between you and
16:35 me and if you don't go through the PTO's
16:37 to get to heaven well hell you go to
16:39 hell it's like okay dude if these PTO's
16:41 are your right-hand men on earth then
16:44 perhaps you are the devil
16:45 they're not God at all maybe God's just
16:48 sitting right here next to me maybe if I
16:51 was ever in a vacuum from God I wouldn't
16:53 exist and therefore since I do exist I
16:55 am in the bosom of God constantly and I
16:57 need not [ __ ] apologize for anything
17:00 just follow common law don't hurt
17:02 anybody else don't be a douche has some
17:04 integrity make your word your bond and
17:06 it's gone in the next [ __ ] journey
17:08 shall we what has been hidden in the
17:11 tomes of religion all over the world
17:14 typically unless you're in some radical
17:17 weird book his wisdom ways to survive
17:23 what the elders of our world did before
17:25 we became completely [ __ ] was that we
17:28 we found out things that gave us
17:31 benefits perhaps even health benefits at
17:34 some point but definitely operational mo
17:36 mode of operation prosperity
17:41 hey don't cheat on you know don't cheat
17:45 on your husband or your wife don't go
17:46 sleeping with someone else don't covet
17:47 don't steal don't murder all those
17:50 things the Ten Commandments men don't do
17:53 those things and life will be better for
17:56 not only you but everyone around you
18:00 yeah cool that's hidden in religion
18:05 so that's the lure that's the attractor
18:07 that is probably with the founding
18:09 people who wrote those books meant to
18:11 communicate to you but what ends up
18:14 happening oh you get all this depending
18:17 on what religion and what time of day
18:18 you're talking about here you got
18:21 priests who have written in pedophilia
18:25 into their Bibles rape and murder of
18:30 kids and women into their Bibles and lay
18:34 down the law I mean it was like not only
18:37 are you allowed to do this but it's the
18:39 most meticulous legalese about how you
18:41 can do it all right so you don't have
18:44 any caution if you're religious about
18:45 that kind of stuff you really think God
18:47 uses man to get to God a flawed creature
18:50 is gonna hold the tome to God I don't
18:53 think so
18:54 just as you wouldn't trust fake news to
18:56 ever tell you the truth ever ever ever
18:58 and you know why because they're making
19:00 a profit off everything that they report
19:03 they lure you it used to be that the
19:07 internet was awesome because there was
19:09 no such formula as news at 11 now they
19:12 kind of got a formula where they have
19:13 half headlines they do it on purpose you
19:16 know scientists have figured I've eat
19:19 this food you might live forever that's
19:21 the headline we got to click in and read
19:22 the article well they're shoving a bunch
19:24 of ads on you because it's a
19:26 profiteering organization truth oh I
19:29 don't think they give a [ __ ] about truth
19:30 they give a [ __ ] about eyeballs making
19:33 money so they can live the life that
19:35 they live these are the pillars that are
19:40 now holding up the world that we accept
19:43 every police officer every military
19:45 person accepts this fucked-up world and
19:48 defends it out of loyalty to their
19:50 position and their institution as of
19:54 right now which is the 18th of August we
20:00 have a Hong Kong in total protests
20:03 they've been in protest for several
20:04 weeks now France has been in a protest
20:06 since last Christmas man you know we're
20:10 coming up on coming up on at least eight
20:15 months right
20:18 it's the people like you and I they get
20:20 tired of this crap that are fighting
20:24 back to try and restabilized the world
20:26 but it's such a complex mess and because
20:28 the profit ears have money and power
20:31 because we watch their crap we watch
20:34 their ads we give them impressions and
20:37 then they make money and then they prove
20:39 it to some corporation we can sell your
20:41 Nike shoes and your Amazon [ __ ] and
20:44 so it works and so we're gonna keep
20:47 lying to the people with bad journalism
20:50 and this will never end
20:53 you'll never find the truth you'll never
20:55 live in prosperity you'll never live in
20:57 peace so I think right now I mean one of
21:03 the cool things that came out of Cuba
21:04 knob was he said you're the press now
21:06 you're the press ok that's sort of a
21:11 dangerous statement but probably more
21:13 true than not the the press that by
21:17 saying that the citizens of the world
21:18 are the press that's a fantastic
21:21 evolution back to the way it used to be
21:24 but the problem is is we still allow our
21:28 governments to spend billions of dollars
21:31 hi plural for Army Corps of psyops all
21:37 these intelligence agencies that
21:39 organize all these mass shootings and
21:42 they cover it all up really killing
21:46 citizens of the world to adjust the
21:49 overall opinion and narrative of things
21:51 and it appears that you can have one
21:55 political group manipulate those
21:59 agencies to look the other way because
22:02 if these mass shootings which are you
22:04 know really killing people but they are
22:06 heavily orchestrated you know events if
22:11 those organizations can operate
22:13 underneath the fabric of truth and our
22:18 FBI can't catch them there's no
22:21 investigation of any kind I mean nothing
22:26 hmm that teaches you about the
22:28 relationship between the two hemispheres
22:31 of what is supposed to be your protector
22:34 versus who is de facto your enemy hmm
22:40 college professors college professors
22:45 let's see you have great teachers in the
22:48 world and I will tell you where your
22:50 great teachers are there usually K
22:51 through 12 usually some in college once
22:56 you get into upper graduate to a
22:57 graduate degree stuff you start getting
23:01 into your tenured professors and it used
23:03 to take you a long time to get that
23:04 status now it's pretty quick because
23:06 that way you get protection by the the
23:08 unions unless you're in a private
23:09 college but what do they do well they
23:14 hang on to their education from when
23:16 they were kids when they were
23:17 technically babies under 25 for most of
23:21 them maybe they got their PhD between 25
23:23 and 30 but they're stunted
23:25 evolutionarily speaking because they
23:27 spent their entire lives inside
23:29 educational institutions instead of
23:31 working in the real world dealing with
23:33 things that they don't agree with
23:35 finding out that a bunch of things that
23:38 they were told at work in a book don't
23:40 work in real life they're told things
23:43 are popular that aren't popular like a
23:45 puter languages or certain social trends
23:51 or what-have-you
23:52 political views of some sort they're
23:56 insecure as everyone is in the world
24:02 nowadays because there's no retirement
24:04 for anybody if you're enjoying a
24:07 retirement situation you even have a
24:10 plan for a pension or whatever you're
24:11 lucky as [ __ ] right where are the most
24:15 reliable you know retirement packages in
24:18 the world well if you're willing to make
24:20 military your career they have a great
24:23 program if you're willing to be a police
24:25 officer for your whole life they're
24:27 going to make a good program for you as
24:28 they drive by my house here government
24:33 institutions have the only real decent
24:35 pensions on planet Earth period
24:39 some corporations still have a little
24:41 bit but that's their trying to get rid
24:44 of them as quickly as possible because
24:45 it's a financial burden for their future
24:47 to have to constantly use their it's
24:50 just like Social Security
24:51 the current employees are paying off the
24:53 retirement packages of those that are
24:57 retiring now the theory is is that the
24:59 older folks made the company possible so
25:01 the younger folks are benefitting from
25:02 the company they built so you might as
25:04 well pay it for not a bad idea I like
25:08 that idea so how do we find out you know
25:14 or how do we even remotely approach a
25:16 methodology to trust the world when
25:22 right now okay right now as of August
25:26 2019 the scumbags that we have allowed
25:31 to rise to power in every single country
25:33 on [ __ ] planet Earth okay you know
25:36 we're all hoping that the president
25:38 adage right now Donald Trump is not one
25:40 of these guys but the jury's gonna
25:42 remain out until he's at office we're
25:46 gonna have to look back and see did it
25:49 did he really do what he said he did you
25:50 know indications are as a lot of good
25:53 things but again Epstein got free he is
25:58 out there somewhere we have to see
26:01 whether or not anybody in that
26:02 investigation ever goes to jail I bet
26:05 nobody ever goes to jail ever not one
26:08 person
26:09 least of all a former president who
26:12 visited the place 26 times 27 times
26:15 whatever never go to jail he's gonna die
26:19 having done all of his evil things and
26:21 of course God will sort it out but still
26:23 it sends a message to all those who are
26:26 currently involved in it you can get
26:29 away with anything and even if a big
26:31 hero president arrives you can still get
26:34 away with everything they're gonna talk
26:35 a big talk and even if there's this cue
26:37 and on on there you know maybe it's X Y
26:39 P D Q and on later on in life there's
26:44 nothing even if a hundred million people
26:47 follow Cuban on no one's going to jail
26:50 it's just how they roll
26:53 unless saying that's what's happened in
26:55 every single category got more
26:57 pedophiles going to jail than ever
26:58 before it's only in the thousands it
27:02 should be in the hundreds of thousands
27:04 the fact that these guys still operate
27:07 blows my mind like they're watching you
27:09 know 5000 people they're 1000 bird and
27:11 this guy still has his little pedophile
27:13 server like how does that even these
27:15 guys are [ __ ] delusional right but
27:18 how do we find a way to survive this
27:21 mess
27:22 well the wise man would probably tell
27:25 you or a wise woman and Oracle making
27:27 cookies for you what do you have to
27:30 worry about what do you really need to
27:33 worry about you really need to worry
27:35 about what shape the earth is I mean do
27:37 you really need to worry about that you
27:39 might be totally right about whatever
27:40 shape you think it is do you have to
27:42 worry about it no why because nothing's
27:48 gonna happen if you find out what shape
27:50 it is if God wanted you to find him at
27:53 the wall of some dome well why would he
27:56 be an [ __ ] and sit there and go well
27:58 only only when they knock on the door am
28:00 I gonna come in and say yeah you found
28:02 me I'm Ed Harris I've been in the moon
28:04 the whole time yeah the life were living
28:08 right now is the life we're supposed to
28:10 be living in my opinion as far as heaven
28:16 in hell and that sort of worried hmm
28:18 you know I'll tell you this much be a
28:23 good person help other people don't
28:27 forget to help yourself man you gotta
28:29 help yourself first your life will fall
28:31 apart if you neglect yourself and help
28:33 others all the time it's always happened
28:36 since the beginning of time and you will
28:39 find people that are really good at
28:41 pretending to be in trouble sometimes
28:47 because they know you'll do their
28:49 laundry or you'll give them money or
28:50 whatever and they'll just milk you dry
28:54 you might die thinking that they were
28:56 legit and you'll find out after death if
28:59 there's any truth that was bestowed upon
29:01 you you were played your whole life and
29:03 your whole journey was sort of wasted
29:06 just just you know keep your ears perked
29:10 up discern things take some breaks for
29:14 yourself every once in a while you're
29:17 the one that's gonna die in your
29:18 deathbed no one else is gonna die in
29:20 your deathbed so what are some of the
29:23 big lies or I should say categories of
29:28 lies I think one of the biggest ongoing
29:31 lies has to do with the fact that we
29:33 live better lives today than we lived in
29:35 the past mmm I think that's
29:38 categorically a bunch of [ __ ] now
29:39 can you reach back to fixed moments in
29:42 time where there was a plague there was
29:45 a war going on and life sucks sure sure
29:49 but and you might be able to say well I
29:53 got a TV today and I got a heating
29:55 blanket and I got a car that goes you
29:58 know I got a car in general right I get
30:00 on a plane and fly around the world and
30:01 go as different places and if it was
30:03 1850 I wouldn't have any of that
30:06 and so life would suck back then it'd be
30:08 great today I was raised in Kansas like
30:11 I said and one of the things they do
30:12 when you're a little kid in Kansas is
30:14 when you're in your K through six which
30:18 at the time was grade school they would
30:20 read us Prairie books some of them are
30:24 fictional and some of them were based on
30:26 true stories of people's lives and you
30:28 got to hear the literally the daily
30:31 churn of a life in the mid-1800s in
30:34 Kansas and another cut in other sorry
30:37 states in the Midwest and what that did
30:42 for me personally I can't vouch for
30:44 anybody else but what that did for me
30:46 was established the fact that these
30:48 individuals lived very satisfying lives
30:54 one at the end of every single day
30:56 whether you're a woman or a man you went
30:59 to bed at night easily because you were
31:02 tired you worked your ass off but you
31:04 also had this sense of accomplishment
31:05 that was phenomenal whatever you did
31:10 it's what you did if you raised kids it
31:12 was rough if you were a farmer it was
31:15 rough if you're a blacksmith etc
31:17 anything it was rough
31:20 but that was the standard so it didn't
31:22 seem anything in any any more difficult
31:25 than anything else you could have picked
31:26 in life and even though Europe might
31:30 have been way more advanced in certain
31:32 areas of construction they lived in
31:34 better homes or whatever while people
31:36 were literally building towns in the
31:39 1800s
31:39 all over the place in the United States
31:42 and living in you know cold cabins and
31:45 you know at bears they had to worry
31:47 about and all that kind of stuff and you
31:49 know Paris might have already had you
31:50 know gorgeous buildings and high-rises
31:53 and castles and all that other kind of
31:55 stuff regardless if you lived in a big
31:58 castle you still had to go do things and
31:59 hunt food and take care of all the same
32:02 things that we had to take care of
32:03 we had outhouses and they crapped out of
32:06 the side of their castle you know the
32:08 vidiian paying income tax in 1850 no
32:12 text at all because that's where the
32:14 founders designed the country you pay a
32:17 lot of taxes so you work your ass off
32:19 for something and it gets taken away
32:21 from you they didn't have them life had
32:26 rules life was simple tiny communities
32:29 behaved because if they didn't you were
32:31 kicked out of the community and now
32:33 communities are so huge you can behave
32:35 badly and christ almighty if you even
32:38 get caught it's a [ __ ] miracle right
32:41 they told you that we died early you
32:45 know I've said the seiner times on the
32:46 show but you know women who supposedly
32:47 died in childbirth all the time you know
32:51 it was like everybody died at 30 you
32:53 know but if you go look on YouTube you
32:56 can look up videos of people I think
33:00 it's in like um some of the first videos
33:02 ever shot I think they're shot
33:03 technically in the 20s it has sound and
33:05 you get to see all these old people
33:08 everybody's in their 90s and 80s late
33:10 80s and 90s some people over 100 they're
33:12 celebrating birthdays of women over 100
33:15 you know what they do they get them out
33:16 of their wheelchair and they dance with
33:17 them because they can dance oh yeah
33:20 they're not doing the the jitterbug and
33:22 all that stuff but they can still move
33:23 around I saw a video woman had 103 and
33:27 they got her had a fur chair they talked
33:29 to her for one thing and she was
33:30 completely lucid I mean
33:33 she was animated lucid not you know none
33:37 of that totally talk normal but families
33:42 in the Midwest had anywhere from 10 to
33:44 20 kids up pop because you wanted as
33:47 many kids as possible one to populate
33:49 your country but - - but - excuse me to
33:53 farm your land well we're all these dead
33:56 women from given birth my god we don't
33:59 have that many kids today with modern
34:00 hospitals and these women were just
34:03 having children inside homes oh yeah
34:07 you're killing it today killing it today
34:11 we have cars we have cars and that's
34:13 great mm-hmm you ever meet a horse and I
34:17 mean really meet a horse imagine your
34:20 car becomes your friend it is your
34:24 companion you know horses are awesome
34:28 you get to know horse and they're super
34:30 brilliant beings as soon as they see you
34:33 they start to whinny like from far away
34:35 they know you're coming
34:37 sometimes because you have some food but
34:39 most of the time they just want to be
34:40 brushed and pet and they would like to
34:43 be ridden and they dig it and they have
34:44 a sense of purpose that was your car
34:47 back in the day and you had a
34:50 relationship with your horse and as soon
34:52 as your horse is back sort of gave back
34:54 gave away and you know you shouldn't be
34:57 right anymore you put it in the pasture
34:58 with the other horses and you meet it
35:00 every day and you feed it every day and
35:01 you take it all the way to the end of
35:03 its life it's your buddy maybe a female
35:07 horse a male horse doesn't matter
35:09 in the 1850s you work for yourself talk
35:14 about job satisfaction man you worked on
35:17 shoes you worked on farms you put up
35:19 fences you pave roads you build houses
35:22 whatever it is you work for yourself
35:25 single income household which was
35:28 destroyed in the 1970s imagine that you
35:33 could live off the income of one parent
35:36 now the other parents busting her ass to
35:39 making all these kids and keeping them
35:41 from dying and eating each other alive
35:45 so that's a full-time job and she would
35:47 participate just as much as the husband
35:48 and whatever they needed to survive
35:50 preparing food farming all that stuff it
35:55 was more even-steven back in those days
35:57 in relationships than it is today but
35:59 what do they tell you about the past oh
36:01 all women were you know just tethered in
36:04 leathers and and restraints and they
36:08 were chained to the ground and they were
36:10 just barefoot and pregnant all the time
36:11 never amounting to anything constantly
36:14 being beaten talk about a revised
36:17 history we have it's a trend to go back
36:22 and redefine history as a bunch of
36:24 [ __ ] repression to make you think
36:26 that today you're more free than you
36:28 ever have been in life right nope all
36:34 [ __ ] okay maybe you think we've made
36:38 serious improvements in medicine okay
36:42 yeah there's some areas we've done
36:43 pretty good you know we're at acute
36:47 polio for the most part malaria and
36:50 stuff which people in America didn't get
36:52 so we travel to the what is it the
36:56 Panama Canal and other jungle areas and
37:00 we start catching malaria and start
37:01 dying so we have to solve the problem
37:03 well don't go there and you want another
37:04 problem how about that but we have made
37:07 some advances the problem is is we
37:10 started allowing corporations to make
37:12 our food and start making it badly and
37:14 so now we get sick SuperDuper quick kids
37:18 with cancer should tell you something if
37:22 you know anything about medicine all
37:25 right well I got a lot of people in my
37:26 family who lived really long okay my
37:31 great great grandfather lived 101 his
37:33 father loved about to be a hundred and
37:34 four okay I don't have the the birth
37:39 date on 104 guy dude had three wives the
37:43 dude had two wives did he have medical
37:47 care no neither one of them did hmm how
37:53 did we survive without insurance forced
37:56 on us right going to the doctor for
38:00 every
38:00 goddamn thing that goes wrong neglecting
38:04 our health all day long because we think
38:05 we're just miracle human beings we
38:08 neglect our basic vitamins like vitamin
38:09 C b-17 vitamin D I saw a chart the other
38:15 day on the internet of all the vitamin
38:17 B's that exist and guess what b-17
38:19 wasn't on the list
38:21 funny the the most cancer curing vitamin
38:29 on planet earth isn't advertised in a
38:31 spectrum of B vitamins phenomenal occurs
38:36 naturally in apricot pits and it's not
38:39 even in the chart hmm
38:42 truth trusting the world where do you go
38:46 eat
38:48 what medicine can you trust what history
38:52 can you trust to build an image of your
38:54 life what agendas that are currently up
38:57 for debate today can you sponsor and not
39:00 have all of the control and happiness in
39:03 your life erased it's getting harder and
39:08 harder and harder there are circular
39:11 logic problems in the world and a
39:15 circular logic problem is that the it
39:20 looks like this it's something like a
39:24 plus B equals B meaning the formula that
39:28 you're putting together equals an
39:30 element in the formula that you're
39:32 calculating how does that apply to real
39:35 life what politicians and governments
39:38 have completely [ __ ] up all of our
39:40 lives globally globally there's not a
39:43 country on this [ __ ] planet it isn't
39:46 messed up due to its government but who
39:50 tells you they're gonna fix the problem
39:51 that the government created more
39:54 government people
39:56 AOC the absolute psychotic [ __ ] from
40:01 Brooklyn New York who supposedly again
40:05 graduates top of her class and can't get
40:06 a job beyond bartending is proof you
40:10 need absolutely no vocational
40:11 capabilities whatsoever
40:14 no intellectual capacity to perceive
40:16 reality to understand anything that
40:18 you're talking about became a house
40:21 representative of the United States of
40:23 America Wow
40:26 Omar the chick who married her brother
40:30 and faked his credentials as a different
40:33 man
40:33 smuggling herself because her family did
40:36 it Oliver members of her family got out
40:38 of Somalia because it was so [ __ ] up
40:40 comes over here and takes a giant piss
40:41 on our country and everyone's outraged
40:45 goes from says once you go back to that
40:46 [ __ ] place you came from if you like
40:48 it so much if you had the want me to
40:51 lock down and you're some goddamn expert
40:52 this should be in our House of
40:54 Representatives crafting in changing the
40:57 way our government works why don't you
41:00 show us that you've ever been to a place
41:02 in your lifetime that had it right
41:04 because you of all people are certified
41:06 as the entities of that requirement it's
41:13 easy to become a politician because it
41:15 requires nothing more than a vote to
41:17 become a politician actors become
41:20 politicians with no background in
41:22 politics whatsoever
41:23 there's no academic test to become a
41:26 politician when you go get a job do you
41:30 just walk in the door and they say oh
41:31 you're breathing
41:33 well there's your job here's your big
41:35 fat salary no doesn't work like that
41:39 does it you probably wouldn't hire
41:42 someone to do the most miniscule thing
41:44 at your house mow your lawn fix a toilet
41:47 unless they had some perceived talent in
41:52 that area and if they screwed up if your
41:56 lawn looks crazy
41:57 they'd kill all your plants they missed
42:01 a bunch of spots your toilet backs up
42:03 and barfs a bunch of crap all over your
42:05 your bathroom floor are you gonna call
42:08 them again nope but we have something
42:13 called terms you get elected out of thin
42:16 air with no credentials but a smile and
42:19 some like aoc crazy Satan MKULTRA eyes
42:23 and you're in for a couple years
42:27 a couple years of absolute tantrum
42:31 destruction of our country and you're
42:33 taking up so much time by causing so
42:35 much attention to yourself because it's
42:37 all about that person's ego not about
42:40 helping the country at all and you can't
42:44 just get rid of them hey you talk to and
42:47 you seem completely ignorant about
42:49 everything that you're discussing
42:50 there's the [ __ ] door there's no term
42:53 you're fired
42:54 you don't know how to mow along get at
42:56 it you don't even know she doesn't know
42:57 what a garbage disposal is unbelievable
43:02 because the vote is all it takes to
43:04 become a member of the government at the
43:09 highest level the ruling class of the
43:13 world figured out that all it needs is
43:14 popularity because that's all it takes
43:16 and takes money to make you popular if
43:18 you're not an actor and so you spend
43:20 enough money you can get enough votes
43:23 and you can go in and just blow the
43:26 whole place up hmm jeez how would you
43:31 even fix that problem Constitution
43:34 didn't set up any requirements to be a
43:35 politician mmm that's one thing they
43:39 missed now I used to think when I was a
43:42 kid that if you came up with a great
43:44 idea for our company you could pull some
43:47 people together and make a product put
43:49 it out there in the world and get rich
43:51 make a big corporation like an apple and
43:54 then and there was a gigantic portion of
43:58 this country's history probably the
43:59 majority of the history of this country
44:01 well that was true a lot of people have
44:03 done it it still happens but boy it is
44:06 absolutely marginalized as soon as
44:09 possible like if I made a new soap that
44:11 everybody wanted to wipe themselves down
44:13 with some big soap company's gonna come
44:16 in and muscle me around they're either
44:18 gonna try to buy me out kill me or go to
44:21 the Senate and find some chemical I'm
44:23 using deem that to be poisonous and so I
44:25 would go out of business they're vicious
44:27 men but I was in the Silicon Valley area
44:32 during the internet explosion and it was
44:37 ridiculous amount of money flying around
44:39 and but I still thought
44:41 that this was legit and you could make a
44:44 good company take it public and make a
44:46 ton of money and then do whatever the
44:48 hell you want to do for the rest your
44:49 life later I found out nobody made it
44:53 unless they were serving the Masters and
44:56 those that weren't got wiped out never
44:59 Yahoo used to be the biggest search
45:02 engine in the world what they weren't
45:04 tied into the intelligence agencies so
45:06 the intelligence agencies co-opted and
45:08 made Google asked for instr or myspace
45:12 why they don't exist anymore because
45:16 they weren't a part of an Intelligence
45:18 Agency Facebook was fake founders with
45:23 fake credentials fake histories with
45:29 Google they just copied the same exact
45:31 profile of Yahoo two guys made a search
45:35 engine oh that sounds like a good
45:36 architect let's just do it again well
45:38 just fund two guys doing the same thing
45:40 at Stanford give them a bunch of money
45:42 bringing a bunch of intelligence agency
45:44 algorithms and then on the first day
45:46 Google Maps works perfectly
45:48 Apple three billion dollars later can't
45:51 get you to every place you want to go
45:53 Microsoft almost gets erased off to face
45:56 the planet because they had lost the
45:57 credibility with the intelligence
45:59 agencies because Apple was taken over
46:02 the market with smartphones once they
46:03 figured I had a co-op smartphones into
46:05 Google's camp then apples now trying to
46:11 convince the intelligence agencies that
46:12 they can do it better still you know
46:16 please still give us money and still buy
46:18 our phones and stuff because we'll do
46:19 whatever you want we'll do whatever you
46:21 want we're not a human being we're a
46:22 corporation so you can't trust
46:26 corporations either can you
46:29 people think that churches have it out
46:33 for their greater good when you have to
46:35 pay a ton of money to be a part of them
46:37 most the time you got fake healers all
46:40 over the world I mean they're just
46:41 laughable on television right but what
46:45 have they done with corporations they've
46:46 made them religions Apple is a religion
46:51 Windows is a religion
46:54 Google is a religion pharmaceutical
46:57 companies are religions people think
46:59 that pharmaceutical scientists actually
47:03 care about them Bethan go to McDonald's
47:07 they don't think that McDonald's cares
47:08 about them oh but that's different
47:10 McDonald's is not a medical institution
47:12 ok [ __ ] it's just a bunch of
47:15 shareholders trying to make a bunch of
47:16 money they don't care about you up they
47:19 cared about you they create cures and
47:20 they'd close their shop go on hiatus
47:23 until another cure needs to be created
47:26 but they don't even try to create cures
47:27 I was in that whole camp man we used to
47:32 laugh about creating cures go see my
47:35 episode called Big Pharma and season 1
47:38 now part of me says look just worry
47:40 about your little circle of life because
47:43 99.9% of your life is just right around
47:46 you it's your friends your family your
47:48 current you know devotion to work and
47:51 whatever your personal projects your
47:53 philosophy of the universe and guess
47:55 what no one can currently currently in
47:58 this day they leave our brains alone for
48:02 the most part but you can't do that
48:06 anymore can you because the globalists
48:07 are trying to close in on the entire
48:09 world they're trying to get rid of every
48:12 single element that makes America free
48:14 and I think that a lot of Europeans have
48:17 finally awakened to this and and not
48:20 that they agree with everything America
48:22 wants to do in the world but again
48:24 that's a that's a very Hodge podgy thing
48:26 I think if you have flew over here and
48:28 talked to half the intellectual
48:29 Americans you would probably agree 100%
48:31 with the philosophy but some things
48:34 would have to be explained or perceived
48:38 as these cowboys and all this other kind
48:40 of stuff whatever but the only reason
48:43 why Europe hasn't turned into a
48:45 tyrannical monarchy mess 2.0 is because
48:49 America has guns and that's it that's
48:52 the only thing keeping the world free
48:53 and if you think any anything otherwise
48:56 you are deluded beyond your [ __ ]
48:58 wildest dreams the globalists have been
49:01 trying to get rid of America's guns so
49:03 they can clamp down the whole planet
49:05 boom
49:06 yeah there's some Muslims here in there
49:08 that got guns in every house they'll
49:10 just mow that place down it'll be over
49:12 there will be no you know Arabs left if
49:16 they become a problem for the ruling
49:18 class at once Europe America Australia
49:21 Canada was all wiped out it's over it is
49:25 over I've said it my gun control episode
49:29 which you can watch in full-on [ __ ]
49:31 shoot calm just look up deep thoughts
49:34 radio it's on there
49:36 I want Europe to get all their gun
49:39 rights back all of them not just you
49:45 know shotguns you should have as much as
49:48 you want but we need Prosperity to
49:52 protect the minds of the individuals so
49:53 we don't have crazies going crazy you
49:56 have to get the pharmaceutical business
49:57 out of the mandatory vaccination
50:00 business so we don't completely [ __ ] up
50:01 all of our kids and then wonder why they
50:03 walk into places blown places blown
50:05 people away or why even if a bunch of
50:07 deep State guys in black outfits going
50:11 in to blow up in El Paso Mall can always
50:13 find a patsy to blame it on because
50:16 there's tons of kids on these crazy
50:18 drugs because the second the kid hated
50:22 school they said kuzzik school suck and
50:24 he's got a bigger brain than the school
50:26 can teach they say oh he's ADHD he's
50:29 bipolar he's all this and let's get him
50:30 on a ton of drugs you know my kid has a
50:33 degree in chemistry she teaches
50:35 chemistry there was a little fad going
50:38 on when she was in college and all the
50:40 kids were trying to take ritalin my kid
50:43 being smart studied all that stuff and
50:46 said ah a lot of the stuff causes
50:48 permanent brain damage so she refused it
50:52 and either drugs going around she'd
50:55 study it find out you know worst-case
50:58 scenarios of what's going on a lot of
51:00 drugs are not the drugs that you think
51:01 you're taking so that's another big
51:02 problem I think the other thing that's
51:06 really disappointing is that we
51:07 definitely have a generation that's
51:09 still left that is hanging on to all
51:13 this old [ __ ] and it compromises us
51:17 because sometimes there are family
51:19 members
51:20 what are you gonna do we're gonna piss
51:22 everybody off in your family yeah you
51:27 don't know you know there's a point
51:29 where you can believe a bunch of
51:30 [ __ ] that doesn't matter like you
51:32 can believe that dinosaurs existed even
51:34 though it's a ridiculous prospect and
51:36 the two guys that pioneered the theory
51:38 of the dinosaur lied for 3540 years
51:40 solid and were deemed by the
51:42 paleontology community as having lied
51:44 about everything but all the fake
51:45 dinosaurs that they created are the
51:46 dinosaurs that you find in the natural
51:50 natural museums of the world okay that
51:56 doesn't really matter right they say
51:59 they're digging a new dinosaur out of
52:00 here out of there whatever doesn't
52:02 matter doesn't really affect your daily
52:04 policy of life does it doesn't make your
52:06 kids have to take a vaccination that
52:07 rots their brain right doesn't take away
52:12 your gun rights and so maybe some of
52:15 those things don't matter whether or not
52:17 the world is flat or round doesn't
52:18 matter it's not gonna take away your
52:20 sovereign rights as a human being you
52:23 know I think one of the things that you
52:25 also can probably put to bed in terms of
52:28 a big concern of yours is someone
52:30 finding God the way that you have found
52:32 God we're not finding God at all have
52:36 you found God and let God go hey you
52:38 know what I know you're preachers
52:40 telling you something different let me
52:42 save you a whole [ __ ] bunch of wasted
52:45 life just be a good person follow
52:51 whatever religion works for you do no
52:54 harm to others as you are doing that
52:56 religion and watch how your flock will
52:59 grow naturally that's how God built the
53:02 planet built the human race if a bunch
53:05 of people see you prospering and they're
53:07 not they're gonna ask questions as to
53:09 how you are prospering and they are not
53:11 if they see that you are following a
53:13 particular religion of a particular kind
53:15 somewhere in the world maybe they
53:18 attribute that to your success and they
53:22 convert but going up to somebody and say
53:25 no you need this you need that oh my god
53:27 you know you're not gonna have a good
53:28 life and they should do everything that
53:29 I do is there any other area of life or
53:33 really tell someone like that until
53:35 another human being that that's the case
53:37 yeah you know I've got a lot of
53:42 education personal education I got a lot
53:44 of skills I would not walk up to the
53:48 human being and say you have to know
53:49 everything that I know to be happy
53:51 quite the opposite okay some of the
53:54 happiest people I've found only know how
53:55 to do one thing and they do better than
53:57 everyone else or they do it as good as
53:58 the best okay that adage that old saying
54:02 is still true to this day so why on
54:05 earth would I move over to my personal
54:08 relationship with God and try to push
54:10 everyone into my system of belief my
54:12 system of belief with God is probably so
54:14 utterly complex that if I had a gun to
54:16 my head and I had to itemize all the
54:18 different factors that contribute to my
54:20 relationship with God I would have a
54:22 bullet through my head before you know
54:24 it because I couldn't possibly
54:26 articulate the you know I don't know 45
54:29 years I've been doing this maybe less 40
54:33 mmm [ __ ] I don't know 30 years I don't
54:35 know it's too complex to communicate to
54:38 another human being and the Bible's just
54:40 a bunch of broad strokes now if people
54:44 will have stories when they'll do with
54:46 which they'll disagree with me where
54:48 they've been saved by another human
54:49 being or they've saved somebody else but
54:53 you know what's you know what's really
54:54 going on there it's not what it sounds
54:56 like and it's not what you thought it
54:58 was these people were ready to change
55:00 these people were looking for something
55:02 they were they're thirsty for the drink
55:05 from your cup of religion that would
55:08 have happened had you not reached out to
55:09 them they were already looking for a
55:12 paradigm change cuz they hated their
55:14 life they paid the price you're gonna
55:19 you can credit the person that handed
55:21 the Bible to you or whatever it was but
55:24 they would have just gone to the next
55:25 person or gone to the book store or
55:27 walked into a church it would have
55:28 occurred I know that's a big shot to a
55:31 bunch of people's egos but it's the
55:32 truth so let's just say you kept a list
55:36 of everything I just said and you're not
55:39 really interested in hearing more
55:40 details on the problem because that's
55:42 pretty obviously even before I started
55:43 this episode you completely understood
55:46 everything I just said and you would
55:47 assumed I would have talked about this
55:49 and you were completely correct and you
55:51 know I only touched the highlights of
55:53 the problems you're a solution person
55:56 you want solutions mmm how do we go
56:01 about that well that's where you get
56:05 into a a big issue a big issue how do
56:12 you do it how did it man exist before
56:16 governments got huge existed in small
56:19 little cliques little communities little
56:21 villages cottages whatever and we
56:25 self-governed in the Western heyday of
56:31 the 1800s in the United States of
56:32 America you had little tiny country
56:35 towns all across this country as you
56:39 entered a particular town they would
56:44 post their most discerning laws on a
56:46 board as you walked in if they didn't
56:49 want you to have sidearms it would say
56:51 if they didn't believe in drinking they
56:54 would say and you could either go in at
56:57 your own risk and violate those laws and
56:59 probably end up dead or you could obey
57:04 or go around that was it but eventually
57:09 we realized that some of these towns
57:11 were sort of out of control some of them
57:14 had no rules there was a lot of deaths
57:16 and a lot of crazy stuff that end up
57:18 occurring in those towns and so we felt
57:21 like well we should probably just blank
57:24 it in an entire region with Lisa minimal
57:26 laws to make sure that we can least
57:28 trust that if we go into any town and
57:30 say Kansas that you know Dodge City
57:33 being the giant problem in Kansas but at
57:36 least we wouldn't worry about getting
57:37 shot in the head in a saloon however
57:40 that's gonna work or whatever the
57:42 problem was if someone was caught
57:45 stealing from someone there's an
57:46 immediate solution to the problem maybe
57:49 you have to do a quick draw in the
57:51 middle of the street maybe you just get
57:53 hung by your [ __ ] neck in front of
57:54 everybody your name gets disgraced
57:59 maybe that's enough The Scarlet Letter
58:01 right maybe get thief tattooed on your
58:06 forehead burned like a brand a deterrent
58:12 so we go through all these chaotic
58:14 phases these hard hardcore draconian
58:17 sort of changes until we form a country
58:21 and then we have federal law again you
58:24 know state laws now what's interesting
58:27 is a lot of us have contemplated you
58:29 know the fantasy scenario okay you're in
58:32 charge what do you do you're in charge
58:35 are you gonna fix things really quickly
58:38 well immediately you know that it's not
58:40 all about you what they've said to you
58:42 is you get to make the rules but you
58:45 have a side problem which is the rest of
58:48 the population agreeing with your ideas
58:51 you could create literally what you
58:54 think is a great law on the first day of
58:56 being the president of the United States
58:57 or whatever country you're from
58:59 chancellor prime minister or whatever
59:02 you call it and your people come and
59:06 they lynch you because they hate that
59:09 particular rule maybe you didn't explain
59:11 it well enough maybe it's just a really
59:14 bad idea
59:14 [Music]
59:16 hmm that's what I call social inertia
59:20 change freaks people out in general but
59:25 you also have public relations groups
59:27 that are hired by corporations to sway
59:29 opinion I think the easiest way to see
59:33 this in a way most of us see this is
59:35 there's a layer of evil in the world
59:36 that is cabal together they don't want
59:40 to follow any rules whatsoever and they
59:42 have perverted their minds beyond your
59:44 wildest [ __ ] dreams and I mean
59:46 anything you think you've read on the
59:48 internet at the dark web abouts people's
59:50 bad behavior I guarantee you there's
59:52 thousands of these bankers these
59:55 monarchs that engage in something so
59:58 much more intense and visceral and gross
60:01 and demonic you can't wrap your mind
60:04 around it I can't wrap my mind around it
60:06 I'm sure that is what's going on problem
60:11 is because we just
60:12 Bay perceptions of power it goes on and
60:17 on and on right we think that people are
60:21 above us but not equal we might preach
60:24 that [ __ ] at church but we don't
60:26 [ __ ] believe it for a second do we
60:28 ask a Catholic Catholic patron is man
60:34 created equal going to any Catholic
60:37 churches man created equal
60:39 [ __ ] go ask a father some pedo father
60:42 Reiner is man created equal in a second
60:45 he says yes and you go why do you have a
60:47 pope than dude well he doesn't think
60:50 he's anything higher oh yeah you have a
60:52 monarchy within your church give me a
60:57 break that we believe anything other
60:58 than class structure class structure has
61:02 been burned into our brains but a lot of
61:06 us have woken up and that's where you
61:08 get to the point where you're like I
61:09 don't trust anybody least of all those
61:12 in authority of power I should say I
61:17 have an episode on politics which I'm
61:18 extremely proud of it's not as boring as
61:21 you think it sounds but it's it take you
61:22 through a scenario of people who get
61:25 stranded on an island just like the show
61:26 lost and we take you through the the
61:29 organic process of dividing up these
61:31 people to live on this island
61:33 there's fishermen on the sea there's
61:35 farmers in the center of the island they
61:38 have different needs and you have
61:39 somebody's got to make the decisions who
61:40 turns into the president and everyone
61:43 gets used to their locations they get
61:46 they learn how to fish better learn how
61:47 to farm better learn how to rule better
61:49 and eventually you have class structure
61:51 it's a very slow meticulous episode
61:54 through that that evolutionary process
61:58 which is very organic and very natural
62:00 and normal but it immediately within
62:03 these three generations you're gonna
62:06 have problems huge problems so I think
62:12 as much as it does not sound like the
62:15 answer that you want I don't care how
62:19 old you are listening to this if as long
62:21 as you're not listening is 100 years
62:22 from now no matter how old you
62:26 if you're if you're alive in 2019 in
62:29 your lifetime you will never see the
62:31 utopia's that we have probably had in
62:34 the past or enacted in some fictional TV
62:39 series like Star Trek you'll never see
62:41 it in your lifetime what are you gonna
62:44 see more of the same life's gonna be a
62:49 battle and it's gonna be an ongoing
62:52 battle you're going to fight for
62:54 everything that you want it's going to
62:56 get more difficult the more ignorance
62:58 that people get which you know again
63:00 educational system has been all but
63:02 completely imploded in at least America
63:05 now anybody get smart in this country
63:08 blows me away when I meet really smart
63:10 kids say in their 20s I'm blown away I
63:13 think that a miracle occurred a [ __ ]
63:16 genetic miracle where they're there
63:18 literally their genes help them through
63:21 probably dense brains come up with great
63:25 ideas it happens in every race happens
63:27 on every sex at least in America I'm
63:29 sure it happens in Europe too right
63:32 something happened that just was going
63:35 to happen but you know all that means
63:38 all that means is that their battle
63:40 might be a fraction of a percent easier
63:44 than your battle now there are rich kids
63:47 with trust funds yeah but let me tell
63:49 you living in Orange County you don't
63:50 have anything to do with that mess they
63:53 live in constant fear of losing all
63:55 their money they usually have extremely
63:57 low IQs with low sort of work ethics in
64:03 a lot of cases why would they why would
64:05 they have any of those talents because
64:06 they've been given a free pass in life
64:10 literally their entire lives will never
64:12 amount to anything of their own volition
64:15 now some kids don't take it that way
64:17 they take theirs they take their
64:19 privilege and they they put the money
64:21 aside and then I'm going to spend it I'm
64:23 gonna earn my own cash and those are the
64:25 kids that you know reinvent themselves
64:28 and keep the lineage of their family
64:30 alive the two biggest things you can do
64:34 in America
64:36 is support any mechanism that fights
64:40 voter fraud bring back paper ballots get
64:44 rid of electric machines and vote your
64:47 ass off with an educated mind about all
64:49 these issues America divides everything
64:53 up in about three main groups right you
64:55 have your district props and your
64:57 district stuff you have your state-level
64:59 stuff and you have your federal level
65:01 stuff again everyone you're voting for
65:06 had to prove nothing about themselves
65:09 other than they could smile like a
65:10 person on a real estate sign that's it
65:14 that's not a qualification for the
65:18 highest command in a particular country
65:21 we see these politicians that are so
65:24 utterly embarrassing and even the best
65:27 ones embarrass themselves constantly
65:29 even though they don't realize that nor
65:30 do they care but there's no agenda in
65:34 the world afoot to make sure that a
65:39 politician has qualifications at all any
65:43 country if you know of a country that
65:46 has anything other than an age
65:48 restriction to be a politician you let
65:51 me know if there's a test you have to
65:53 take do you have to be able to name all
65:55 50 states and their capitals and maybe
65:58 the governors of all those states do you
66:00 have to take a foreign policy test do
66:02 you have to take a history test and you
66:05 know what kind of test could that be you
66:06 are is that a regurgitation of fake
66:09 history test or is it a real history
66:10 test you know it doesn't exist
66:15 and you know if it did it'd be probably
66:17 full of [ __ ] right mm-hmm there's no
66:23 quick solutions at all for any of this
66:26 stuff but you want to be happy and
66:29 here's the good news at the end of the
66:31 episode
66:32 I do believe save some you know crazy
66:37 events they're gonna occur that you
66:38 can't change that you probably will
66:40 never be personally involved in although
66:42 the Democrats would definitely try to
66:44 attack your next mall so sometimes
66:47 you'll find yourself and one of their
66:48 organized
66:50 which are basically globalists right
66:53 you're gonna be able to live your life
66:55 without anyone messing with you any of
66:58 the hardships you have well and you know
67:00 the ones that are gonna introduce
67:01 themselves into your life is if you lose
67:04 a president that can stop the recessions
67:07 and depressions from occurring then
67:09 you're gonna have them and there's gonna
67:11 rob you of your opportunity you lose
67:14 your job you lose your personal business
67:17 whatever you were working on just goes
67:20 on pause for a couple years or five
67:22 years or whatever we're still recovering
67:24 in the United States of America from the
67:26 2008 crash
67:27 we are the estimate over 30 percent of
67:32 the country is still reeling from that
67:34 and still suffering job problems and
67:36 I'll tell you personally you know that
67:41 recession hit at the end of 2008 and I
67:46 was 11 years younger when that happened
67:48 okay
67:50 so if it takes 11 years to truly I mean
67:54 we're not even fully recovered yet we'll
67:56 say it takes another four years to
67:57 recover from that thing geez I'll be in
68:00 my 50s well so the world is booming
68:04 where I live but now age discrimination
68:07 will come into play maybe I you know I
68:10 mean I'm pretty healthy but if I was a
68:11 normal you know cheeseburger eating and
68:15 you know fluoridated person and maybe
68:17 I'm getting really sick or something and
68:19 so by the time the Rakata me recovers
68:21 I'm not physically fit but what about
68:23 the people that were in there let's say
68:27 that you were sixty you don't get to
68:31 retire until you're 75 but you know the
68:34 funny [ __ ] thing about retiring at 75
68:37 go and try and take an interview at 60
68:39 go try and take an interview at 65 where
68:43 are you gonna get a job at those ages
68:45 unless you live in a little town where
68:47 people go oh yeah Joe over there man he
68:49 can fix your car better than anybody you
68:50 can build your house better than anybody
68:52 unless you live in a little town where
68:53 your rep is so heavy but you can get a
68:56 job if you're in the big city oh my god
68:58 you got to move you got to get out of
69:00 here unless you can find someone to pay
69:02 your bills
69:04 but your let's say your 60 in the 2008
69:07 it's 11 years later and it's just
69:09 starting to come round again so you're
69:11 71 now so you've had the last ten years
69:15 of your life you're getting you know age
69:19 discrimination you're you're you're
69:21 literally unable to get a job but you
69:23 have the skills because the recession
69:25 killed the last ten years of your life
69:28 go into your seventies and you get ill
69:31 and you pass away hmm used to be that
69:37 you'd have like your career of choice
69:38 and then your back-up plan if you want
69:42 to be a comedian when you better have a
69:43 nice street skill you know on the back
69:45 end of the deal
69:46 to pay the bills until that takes off
69:49 and they meet that only takes off for
69:50 ten years
69:51 I got raccoons back there so one of the
69:56 reasons why continual education is going
69:58 to be a gigantic thing in the 21st
69:59 century is because you're gonna need to
70:01 be able to fall back on four or five
70:03 different things unless you want to work
70:06 for a fast food place again as long as
70:10 it pays your bills and you're happy man
70:12 you're winning it's really all it takes
70:13 you don't need a big high status job
70:15 that's [ __ ] eventually you won't
70:18 care about how fancy your car is or
70:21 necessarily how fancy your clothes are
70:23 any that kind of stuff
70:24 and I think that one of the sad facts
70:30 that's coming up for the kids today is
70:31 the following because the well even
70:39 before the education got completely
70:40 obliterated kids were basically
70:43 conditioned to live with their parents
70:44 for as long as they possibly could I
70:46 mean a young male living with his
70:48 parents in his early 30s is hardly a
70:50 [ __ ] surprise these days right so
70:53 they're delaying their entry into
70:55 society as a truly fully functional
70:57 adult and then they get in it and by the
71:02 time they try to get a job maybe they
71:05 have the skills maybe they don't but
71:08 because of the way this country frowns
71:11 on age okay so now you've reduced your
71:16 maybe from 18 years old to 50 that's
71:19 where you're gonna really be able to get
71:21 most of your jobs that you desire
71:22 without anybody looking at your funny
71:24 depends on the 40s can start screwing
71:27 with you pretty much too
71:28 but now you've shortened it by 10 years
71:31 maybe even more because it's gonna take
71:33 you a while to get caught up today
71:35 unfortunately a lot of kids graduate
71:37 with bad education I talk about it all
71:40 the time and the think tanks and stuff
71:41 that I'm involved in it's like it's
71:43 super duper bad employers are really
71:45 just blown away about how ignorant these
71:49 kids are when they come in to get a job
71:51 one expect to get the job and two they
71:53 expect their salaries to be enough to
71:56 live a decent life even a better than
71:59 decent life because there's a lot of
72:00 Instagram pictures out there in
72:02 Instagram so Foxwood people man like if
72:06 you follow a bunch of you know
72:09 yeah these 1% and I'm not saying 1% from
72:13 the old banker 1% but the 1% of people
72:15 they truly have found their niche in
72:18 life and you follow them and maybe
72:21 they're inspiring T and you you get your
72:23 game going and you get up there then
72:25 great that's fantastic but a lot of
72:27 people are unhappy because they're
72:30 shifting their desires to something that
72:32 one doesn't matter and two they can
72:35 never achieve because they don't have
72:37 the willpower to go get the skills to
72:39 get it going there's a reason why so
72:43 many of my episodes are about the
72:45 fortification of you personally from
72:48 your social issues with people in
72:50 betrayal and trust from getting back up
72:52 taking charge being self educated how to
72:55 become an artist how to write a movie
72:56 all these things I'm showing you guys in
72:59 these episodes are very strategic
73:01 because I think that you know only some
73:05 of you are interested in the
73:06 screenwriting stuff but those of you who
73:08 are are really interested in it and
73:09 that's huge you're gonna have to get
73:13 tough to live in this world most of you
73:15 already know that but it's never gonna
73:18 well put it this way if you're ever able
73:23 to get to a plateau where you think
73:24 you've got it you got a formula that
73:27 makes money and it's never going to be
73:29 taken away for
73:30 me one double down triple down quadruple
73:32 down to reinforce all of that because it
73:36 can be taken away from you most likely
73:38 you could get everything and get sick
73:41 which is why you got to eat well you
73:46 have to be skeptical of the medical
73:49 industry don't go to the hospital every
73:51 goddamn time you get a sniffle because
73:55 they're gonna give you stuff you
73:56 shouldn't be putting in your body my
73:59 relatives who lived a very long time
74:00 didn't put a bunch of crap in their body
74:02 hence why they lived a very long time
74:06 I'm in an episode on trends trends are
74:10 deadly trends are imperative in some
74:14 areas of business because someone will
74:19 say that you know I'll give you a couple
74:22 that are really funny the the web
74:24 industry I think I may have one other
74:26 episode and I haven't aired yet that's
74:28 going to review the same thing so I
74:29 apologize if this is a repeat but the
74:31 web industry is always generating new
74:34 languages and new platforms to get
74:35 things done and the people that find a
74:38 combination that works for them they get
74:39 super religious about it and they start
74:41 heating anybody else and criticizing
74:43 everyone else that doesn't use their
74:44 religion but never once paying attention
74:46 to the fact that every technology
74:48 expires in about five years and the
74:51 other thing is that great applications
74:54 are being made all the time with other
74:55 languages it's like a religion that
74:58 thinks every other religion is full of
74:59 [ __ ] it's the same old formula it's a
75:01 defect in mans of thinking another big
75:05 one that's out there today which is just
75:07 hilarious is some of you will see the
75:11 companies are now advertising as a big
75:13 giant keyword that they're agile what is
75:18 agile agile is basically a formal word
75:24 for you know how to manage a project
75:26 from start to finish there's a couple
75:28 little things that they do it's two
75:29 Japanese guys in the 80s that came to
75:32 America and said why are Americans
75:33 really good at managing projects and
75:35 then they looked at one of the companies
75:37 look to several companies and distilled
75:39 out a way then in the 90s two American
75:41 guys in the Bay Area gave it the name
75:44 I actually don't even think they came up
75:46 with the name agile it was another ten
75:47 years later essentially if a child blows
75:51 your mind then prior to agile you must
75:53 have been a complete [ __ ] abject
75:54 [ __ ]
75:55 on how to manage your project you would
75:56 have known nothing about a managed
75:58 project the funny thing is is that I
76:00 will go to companies I I talked to a
76:03 company here locally that was just
76:05 exhales all over their web site and
76:07 after I did this little interview with
76:09 them I realized they had no management
76:11 in the entire company which means being
76:13 an agile company with no management is
76:14 is an oxymoron they're a lying company
76:17 about their agile capabilities sure they
76:20 might what they basically do is they
76:22 they make a list of everything they need
76:26 to do [ __ ] profound idea right and
76:30 then they just chop it up in little
76:31 pieces and to call sprints and they
76:33 sprint for no more than four weeks at a
76:35 time
76:35 supposed to do these burn down sheets
76:37 every day which is how much of the list
76:39 are they getting done which they call
76:40 backlog and then how much effort did it
76:42 take to get that done and you can
76:44 identify employees that are not doing a
76:46 very good job I'm telling you right now
76:48 I have managed not a billion dollars
76:53 just yet but definitely in the hundreds
76:56 of millions of dollars worth of projects
76:58 with more employees mostly Electronic
77:01 Arts because they spend a ton of money
77:03 and no one ever heard of this you know
77:06 the video game industry cranks out I
77:08 don't know five billion dollars in games
77:11 a year
77:12 no I John anywhere the movie industry
77:14 generates at least five billion dollars
77:16 worth of movies every year there's no
77:18 agile anywhere but these companies will
77:21 put this [ __ ] out there like if you
77:22 don't have this you're a [ __ ] idiot
77:24 and edit and it's like no you're a [ __ ]
77:27 for thinking that this is the only way
77:29 to get something done it's great if you
77:31 have it that's great
77:32 no one's criticized if you got it if
77:34 you're saying that's the only way to get
77:35 it done you have no concept of what the
77:39 rest of the world even looks like it's
77:41 weird right so the world is in a really
77:44 weird place man I'm glad I have all the
77:47 skills that I have because I can do a
77:49 million different things and I mean a
77:51 million different things and I love it
77:52 keeps my life rich you know I think you
77:57 would
77:57 benefit from the same thing but if you
77:59 are an individual who has an itch and
78:01 you're really good at it and maybe
78:03 you're even getting tired of it
78:05 do yourself a favor look at the pain
78:08 that everyone else is going through and
78:11 realize how fortunate you are like I've
78:16 said several times I just talked another
78:18 person today or yesterday excuse me
78:23 their parents their family has a very
78:25 successful business and this person
78:28 looked at me said I don't want to carry
78:29 on my family business but she wants to
78:32 go and work for someone else in the same
78:34 exact industry and I just looked across
78:36 today I was like don't do that don't do
78:40 that you're gonna throw away and I know
78:43 people in the same industry her family's
78:45 in and where the kids didn't follow up
78:46 or part of the kids did part of the kids
78:48 didn't and now the kids that didn't are
78:50 broke and they're they're hating on
78:53 their brothers and sisters who went
78:55 ahead and took over the family business
78:57 accusing them of all kinds of things
78:59 which are completely untrue no you were
79:01 deluded and you left you left and you
79:05 did take over the family business that's
79:06 why you have no money that's why now if
79:10 the family business is something really
79:12 horrible then of course don't do it it
79:15 takes a lot to build a business that you
79:17 would call a family business has been
79:19 around for 10 20 30 years that is so
79:22 rare these days that's the way
79:23 everything used to work and I've met
79:26 families all over Southern California
79:28 come here for tourism
79:30 I met a mother and a son and a local
79:34 eatery and it was it was earlier this
79:41 summer but the mother son she says we
79:44 have an RV business we rent and sell RVs
79:46 so some people might think that super
79:48 white trash there in Vegas and the Sun
79:52 was there and she says my son is taking
79:55 it over and my other son has already
79:56 been working for us for a really long
79:58 time
79:58 and the family's going to pass it down
80:00 to one generation and that kid was so
80:02 happy to take over the business and I
80:05 looked at the kid and I said you are one
80:07 lucky kid I'm so glad you're happy to
80:09 take over this business because that is
80:11 the
80:11 thing to do you can add more businesses
80:13 later but keep the core business going
80:15 didn't have to tell us kid anything he
80:17 was already on board it was awesome so
80:21 we if I need this episode something to
80:25 the effect of not being able to trust
80:26 the world then here's the final final
80:30 judgement from your humble narrator in
80:33 his backyard at 12:14 a.m. don't don't
80:39 trust the world don't trust any of it
80:42 and I will tell you that that doesn't
80:46 mean you're gonna be unhappy if you live
80:48 your life like that you will discern all
80:50 information that comes in from the
80:51 outside world and you will be more happy
80:53 you will be happy with individual
80:56 decisions that people make but at least
80:57 you will be happy in your little
80:59 microcosm that is your life and you're
81:03 gonna be in good company as these
81:06 decades roll forward unless something
81:08 undoes you know if if all the Monarchs
81:12 can be put out of power and demonized
81:14 for exactly what they are if all the
81:16 bankers can be hung by their [ __ ]
81:18 necks and we passed some global laws
81:21 against compound interest and all this
81:24 usery that's going on especially between
81:26 countries to sabotage countries if we
81:29 can get everyone to feeling comfortable
81:30 in their own skin get rid of communism
81:32 of any kind capitalism well hey if you
81:36 don't have money to finance your
81:37 business what are you gonna do you gotta
81:39 borrow from somebody that's what
81:40 capitalism is it's nothing more than
81:42 that balancing a distribute distribution
81:45 of wealth well your only solution to
81:47 that is education education education
81:49 education get rid of corrupt
81:52 intelligence agencies and how they spy
81:54 on you just just enforce Europe go
81:57 reinforced Magna Carta will reinforce
81:59 the Constitution which is which is a
82:01 derivative of Magna Carta and all these
82:03 places will disappear do we need to know
82:06 that aliens exist nope
82:09 do we need to know the world's flat nope
82:11 do we need to know whether or not we
82:13 went to the moon and maybe if we want to
82:14 get rid of a lie
82:15 other than that we're good we're good
82:21 let me know what you think in the
82:22 comments because this is a very
82:25 volatile complex briarpatch of thinking
82:30 that I I have never heard anyone give a
82:34 dissertation that would constitute a
82:38 solution in my eyes if you have them
