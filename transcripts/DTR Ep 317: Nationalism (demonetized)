00:02 [Music]
00:23 you
00:24 [Music]
00:34 good evening ladies and gentlemen and
00:36 welcome back to deep thoughts today I
00:40 thought I would touch on this subject
00:42 that keeps going around and it's going
00:44 to become a bigger and bigger buzzword I
00:46 think in the coming months and even
00:49 years it's a global issue and it's the
00:54 question of nationalism now just like
00:58 all of us sometimes you don't know
00:59 anything about these subjects but you're
01:03 gonna listen anyway so just to kind of
01:05 get caught up on this whole thing just
01:08 in case you've been buried in something
01:10 else you just don't give a crap
01:11 but you dig the show you want to give me
01:13 a chance to explain some of this stuff
01:16 to go obviously the arguments will go up
01:19 to people that spend a lot of time
01:20 thinking about this nationalism is the I
01:24 would like to define it as the
01:27 sociological act of a group of people
01:30 coming together and forming a definition
01:34 in their mind of what their country and
01:38 culture represents and then defending
01:41 that definition and with their dying
01:45 breath willing to die for it like a
01:48 soldier understands the sovereignty and
01:51 value of their homeland versus someone
01:53 else's home win now what nationalism
01:56 doesn't mean is that you dislike another
01:58 group of people's definition of their
02:01 nationalism for their country now
02:04 obviously if someone were to were to
02:06 convince a bunch of people that their
02:08 suffering is the result of some other
02:10 group and it's not well then you got
02:13 some [ __ ] you got to deal with right
02:14 what state are we in in 2018 globally
02:18 well we're in something called globalism
02:22 globalism is sort of a nice thought like
02:24 socialism was it that which is that the
02:28 whole world can come together under one
02:29 umbrella unify all their definitions of
02:33 how we should live culturally and then
02:36 just get along
02:37 there's no borders it's just all one
02:40 happy planet run by oh wait a minute the
02:44 same jerks tip on our world
02:47 today and they do a very poor job at it
02:50 right but what's the alternative
02:52 to either nationalism or globalism if
02:56 you talk to your average Melissa militia
02:58 man they might tell you personal
02:59 sovereignty the individuals right to
03:02 live on some land that they have
03:03 sequestered and built their family on
03:06 yeah their farm or whatever and they're
03:10 an individual we have discovered over
03:13 time that the individual cannot survive
03:16 as easily as a group of people as long
03:19 as there's one jerk in the entire world
03:22 who for whatever reason is manifested
03:24 sub power they've convinced a bunch of
03:28 bigger people than you to do whatever
03:30 they say because sometimes people will
03:33 do things without getting any reward of
03:35 any kind they just like being told what
03:38 to do you know those cartoons and Warner
03:41 Brothers where the animals back in the
03:44 30s you would often have like this big
03:48 dopey powerful dog that would do what
03:50 the little tiny dog said it's a bit like
03:53 that
03:53 that was not based on an archetype of
03:55 reality that doesn't exist it was based
03:58 on archetype of reality that absolutely
03:59 exists to anyone out there I would say
04:02 don't you think man however and whenever
04:07 man was created almost sapiens sapiens
04:10 don't you think that man tried to do
04:12 everything by him or herself until it
04:15 just didn't work out and they realized
04:16 oh my god we got to have to live in
04:19 these packs to fight all these
04:22 incredible predators and then to fight
04:25 our own kind because eventually someone
04:27 gets upset with what they have having
04:30 maybe mismanaged their life or they just
04:32 they're in a tough spot and they try to
04:34 take what's yours and you have to go
04:36 wait you know we'll share with you you
04:38 could become part of our tribe and
04:40 someone goes now I don't want to be a
04:41 part of your tribe I just want you to go
04:43 away and I want you to drop what you
04:44 have and it's mine it sounds a lot like
04:46 the people that run the world doesn't it
04:47 so today I want to analyze sort of where
04:51 to put this little gauge on the meter
04:55 because you're dealing with a situation
04:59 where there's a lot of people
05:01 at varying levels of age of maturity of
05:03 education and experience
05:05 / wisdom we are always at odds with
05:12 trying to come up with a balanced world
05:14 in any form of government any form of
05:18 thought process of how to view each
05:21 other right we have issues you'll find
05:25 it in your own family trying to convince
05:27 someone to think exactly like you about
05:28 everything else how do you gain world
05:30 peace how do you do it if you guys got
05:32 it two pieces of paper and two people
05:33 who've been together for 30 years and
05:36 you haven't rehearsed this and you say
05:38 how do you do it
05:41 they would write down two completely
05:43 different lists it'll happen
05:46 okay it might mean the same thing but
05:50 you'll find there there are differences
05:52 take the Bible and you say you guys are
05:54 too devout Christians you've been
05:55 Christians for 50 years of pop and why
05:58 don't you sit down and write what you
05:59 think about letter to Corinthians about
06:01 the genesis about anything and they'll
06:07 come up with slightly different
06:08 definitions and because of that
06:10 difference and it's not a difference
06:12 because anyone is fighting anyone else
06:14 it's a difference because it's very
06:16 tough it's extremely tough no matter how
06:19 much time you spend together to get your
06:21 minds all humming in the same exact way
06:23 but now let's think about it we have
06:28 tried globalism a little bit and boy as
06:33 it caused some serious issues
06:36 now some globalists will say well yeah
06:38 of course there's always gonna be a lot
06:40 of tough spots at the very beginning and
06:42 eventually over decades or a couple
06:44 centuries that'll all work itself out
06:47 maybe so maybe so but what is the what
06:53 is the charter of globalism
06:55 well no nation-states no borders
06:58 everyone can live wherever the hell they
07:00 want to live and magically everything's
07:03 going to get together and they're
07:05 supposed to work together right
07:06 individual groups of human beings are
07:08 supposed to work together okay what are
07:12 we finding out about the
07:14 this absolute Muslim invasion of Europe
07:18 I'm not talking about the people that
07:20 have legally come in over the last you
07:22 know 5060 years I'm talking about the
07:24 last five years of people claiming to be
07:26 Syrian 94% of which aren't the number
07:32 changes a little bit but it's over 90
07:33 percent art and they come in and they
07:36 get all this free aid and they rape and
07:38 kill people and the cops look the other
07:39 way because Merkel doesn't want to have
07:41 to let you know that globalism isn't
07:44 working this faction of people have been
07:47 very honest with you just look up the
07:49 Arron Brera Brotherhood website and read
07:52 their charter they have no intention of
07:55 blending in with you they are here to
07:57 subdue you to suppress you and to get
08:01 rid of you eliminate you eliminate your
08:04 genes eliminate your religion eliminate
08:07 your way and I'm not trying to fear
08:08 monger alright I'm not trying to make
08:10 you hate Arab people but the individuals
08:13 that are going in are exactly the same
08:15 way and we have the same thing with
08:16 these caravan people
08:17 whoever's financing that coming into
08:20 America they have no intent of blending
08:25 in with America they want to make this
08:26 place their [ __ ] down south it's
08:29 what they want to do they have no
08:31 backbone to fight for their own country
08:33 their own land and in my book without
08:35 with the way I was raised there's
08:37 nothing more despicable than a human
08:39 being that won't fight for their own
08:40 land but thinks they believe in
08:43 something called the magic dirt theory
08:46 the magic dirt there is this interesting
08:49 notion that someone believes is simply
08:52 standing on the soil of some other
08:54 region of the world instantly imbues
08:55 them with all of the education
08:58 intelligence and rational thoughts that
09:00 they were incapable of getting where
09:01 they were obviously that isn't the case
09:04 it doesn't work that way you don't just
09:07 get to [ __ ] get magically imbued
09:09 otherwise we make a patch of land really
09:11 awesome and everyone get a chance to
09:12 step in it and they become brilliant
09:14 right I once wrote an article about
09:17 replacing United States money getting
09:20 rid of all the fiat currency that we use
09:23 and the mechanisms by which to handle
09:25 loans that exist how to replace economy
09:27 and
09:27 kind of thing and in the end I created a
09:32 National Bank something we really don't
09:36 have in any way shape or form that
09:38 controls anything because we have a fiat
09:40 currency private for-profit bank called
09:42 the Federal Reserve 80% of its members
09:44 are hidden by charter because it's a
09:48 private bank
09:48 nobody knows who owns 80% of that place
09:51 what the American people bought 10% with
09:54 our gold they bought it with our fake
09:57 money they printed money and put it back
09:59 into the their own bank and said see we
10:01 invested the other 90% but they didn't
10:04 give up any assets to do so hmm so
10:08 someone criticized the article and said
10:12 are you talking about creating a
10:13 National Bank I said yeah oh we've
10:17 already tried that and doesn't work and
10:20 I was like well not true we haven't done
10:24 it for any length of time in the history
10:25 of this country national banks can do
10:28 things very interesting like get rid of
10:31 compound interest usery the worst madam
10:34 mathematical formula on planet earth the
10:37 one that keeps you in debt forever it
10:41 also allows the people of a country to
10:44 own the money that they have in their
10:46 pocket when you pull it out you turn it
10:48 over and it says where it says today
10:50 Federal Reserve Note which means
10:52 property of a private for-profit being
10:54 controlled by Europeans right to control
10:56 the interest rates at which money is
10:58 created and loaned they don't like a
11:02 president they can just jack it up and
11:05 destroy that president they can create
11:07 booms and busts they don't necessarily
11:10 they they outsource all of that to the
11:12 investment banking houses to do so they
11:15 can kind of stay out of the blame game
11:17 once they create a bunch of you know
11:21 vacillating health issues with the
11:24 economy through controlling everyone who
11:28 needs to do a quick alone in the middle
11:29 of the night which is mainly what the
11:31 Federal Reserve does in the tune of
11:33 billions of dollars we as the people
11:37 suffer
11:38 we get the booms and busts that destroy
11:40 our worlds we can't afford to pay for a
11:45 loan to get a home these are evil
11:48 organizations created by the most evil
11:51 people on this planet and it's not just
11:55 that they're evil that they've created
11:56 fiat currency and want to control us
11:58 from far away right that's bad enough
12:00 right but when you look into their
12:04 personal lives all of their personal
12:06 lives are filled with absolute insanity
12:10 right the famous director Stanley
12:13 Kubrick made a movie his last movie in
12:16 the 90s called
12:17 Eyes Wide Shut Eyes Wide Shut is not a
12:20 movie I like very much for just its face
12:23 value when you go deeper into the
12:25 meaning of it he was supposedly quoted
12:28 as saying it was his finest work but
12:31 it's there to expose the Cabal that is
12:33 carried through and practiced by these
12:35 bankers crazy satanic parties okay now I
12:41 have read that 45 minutes of the film
12:44 was actually cut from the film which is
12:48 landmark for a Kubrick film because
12:51 Kubrick always had less cut rights and
12:54 supposedly I actually heard back in the
12:56 I heard that back when this film came
12:59 out and I thought that he actually got
13:00 last cut on the film but apparently not
13:02 the parts that they cut out were all
13:05 parts related to the party and it's a
13:08 tent and it's meaning he was trying to
13:11 expose them we've seen pictures of
13:15 Rothschild parties little baby parts
13:17 everywhere yeah their little rubber
13:19 dolls porcelain dolls but they are
13:21 mimicking the death of children all over
13:24 their tabletops the Beatles came out
13:27 with an album with dead body poor dead
13:30 you know meat parts all over them with
13:32 baby doll parts as well sick and nobody
13:36 knows that ever happened because they
13:38 pulled the album cover within two weeks
13:39 and all four guys are smiling all four
13:44 guys are smiling well no wonder Paul
13:46 McCartney spend so much time coming
13:48 after Donald Trump he probably is
13:51 involved with this
13:52 housecat he posed for such an acidic
13:54 album cover it has nothing to do with
13:57 any of the antics they ever did in any
13:59 other movies or any of their little
14:01 videos or any of their crazy
14:03 interviews when they were young so that
14:06 is your your ventricle system inside of
14:10 a global istic movement globalism is not
14:14 about the beautiful thought process of
14:18 world peace it is about the bankers that
14:21 control us today getting ultimate
14:22 control over us in the future and they
14:25 want it to be the very near future the
14:27 European Union is the first move they
14:29 have ever pulled to pull this all
14:32 together and now in one way or another
14:36 Spain France Germany and I believe Italy
14:41 are all bankrupt by supporting all these
14:45 countries countries that came in and
14:46 lied about their books Cyprus you know
14:50 getting under getting upside down right
14:51 away and I think seizing 20% around 20%
14:55 of their citizens bank accounts to pay
14:58 off national debts can you imagine that
14:59 you have a hundred thousand dollars in
15:01 the bank and you wake up one morning and
15:03 $20,000 is missing because your country
15:05 stole it from you
15:06 to pay for debts mm-hmm Global isms
15:11 awesome I wasn't privy to this but one
15:14 of our listeners reported in and said
15:16 that Greece falsified their books to get
15:19 into the EU not letting anyone know that
15:22 how bankrupt they were and then of
15:24 course big countries like Germany the
15:26 biggest GDP winner of Europe had a swoop
15:29 in and pay off debts is it's all shared
15:32 debt any of you've ever started a
15:34 business with a bad partner or shared
15:36 adventure was someone who was lazy you
15:38 know exactly what this feels like you're
15:41 willing to do everything in anything to
15:43 get the job done the other person says
15:45 well geez they're getting all the work
15:47 done I don't have to do anything in the
15:49 end your chances of succeeding are
15:52 negligible single percent low percent a
15:56 fraction of a percent in some cases
15:58 right well nationalism is a way for you
16:03 as a country
16:04 to be sovereign with the same mindset at
16:07 least the closer tighter group of people
16:10 that recognize themselves with the name
16:12 Germany England France America all the
16:17 countries of the world they come
16:19 together and they say I'm a proud
16:21 Nigerian I'm a proud South African you
16:23 know they live in the same climates they
16:27 have the same businesses right if
16:28 there's a chain of businesses in a
16:31 country most the time everyone's
16:32 familiar with it right so you start to
16:34 develop this hive mind well you know I
16:37 don't know if I like the McDonald's
16:38 McRib as much as I did 2008 yeah me too
16:41 bandit just seems rubbery and strange
16:43 yeah it wasn't ever any good I don't
16:44 know I was only 13 when they came out
16:46 but you share these thoughts you share
16:48 this constant they're going to try and
16:52 they're already starting to try to
16:53 demonize nationalism who would demonize
16:56 it well I don't think the individuals of
16:59 any one country really have a big thing
17:02 up there but at least in America I don't
17:04 hear any one extreme left progressive
17:06 nutbag or even a right winger get in and
17:10 try to promote globalism in any way
17:12 shape or form they don't really care
17:15 they're not really paying attention it's
17:17 a bigger issue than them where we are
17:19 sequestered by the Atlantic in the
17:20 Pacific so we don't just jump on busses
17:23 and trains and go to other countries
17:26 like you can in Europe the people who
17:28 promote globalism are people like George
17:30 Soros guys worth you know tens of
17:36 billions of dollars way more than they
17:39 say he's worth right I met a gentleman
17:41 that managed a lot of his properties and
17:43 he said you know they say he's only
17:45 worth 18 billion or something like that
17:46 he goes we managed 40 billion of his of
17:48 his real estate assets so don't believe
17:52 the hype it's probably in the hundreds
17:54 of billions right but why would these
17:57 individuals like Angela Merkel a lot of
18:01 the Prime Minister's and especially all
18:02 the kings and queens of the world why
18:04 why do they support globalism so much
18:08 obviously it's to control but there's
18:11 probably a deeper personal thing that
18:15 you need to keep in mind when you're
18:16 trying to think in the mind of someone
18:18 who
18:18 is evil you have to understand the Iago
18:21 principle Yaga was a character in a
18:24 Shakespeare play of a fellow he
18:26 convinces a fellow that his wife is
18:28 cheating on him when she's not
18:30 eventually he kills his wife and comes
18:34 to regret it
18:35 but Yago from his perspective is doing
18:39 what is right for him these people are
18:43 doing what is right for them in their
18:45 mind and their sick [ __ ] brains okay
18:48 you need to get to the point where you
18:51 understand that if you're a good person
18:52 then you barely possess the brain cells
18:55 and the algorithms to think one thought
18:57 that they think on any one particular
18:59 day you know we worry about our neighbor
19:01 as being racist the level of racism
19:06 these globalist have is phenomenal but
19:09 they play the game of racism to get what
19:12 they want in the end okay if they don't
19:15 have two countries that want to live
19:16 together and get rid of their border and
19:18 push the people together then they use
19:20 the racists the racism card between
19:23 those two people to get them to fight
19:25 over the principle of them unifying
19:28 their economic platforms such that these
19:31 individuals can control them with the
19:34 personal thing you have to remember is
19:36 that these individuals are trying to
19:37 imbue their family with infinite control
19:40 and infinite power they're very
19:42 interested in legacy that you're
19:44 thinking my kids and their kids and
19:46 their kids are going to control the
19:47 world so when they die they have this
19:50 narcissistic weird paranoid
19:53 schizophrenia satisfied by their utter
19:57 desire for greed now mankind has been
20:00 around for quite a while on this planet
20:02 surface right and we've had thousands of
20:05 years to become civilized and figure out
20:07 how to be good to each other
20:09 and a bunch of us have figured it out
20:11 right there's a bunch of countries for
20:13 the most part livid extremely peaceful
20:15 lives they don't minimize women they
20:20 don't persecute religion they're pretty
20:24 chill pretty amazing folks but we still
20:28 have a giant portion of this planet
20:32 that is borderline civilized and they
20:36 are not an entire country or entire
20:38 group of people by race or anything they
20:41 are small little sex all over the world
20:43 it's sort of like the in America we have
20:46 these crazy evangelists that run around
20:49 you know doing despicable things in this
20:53 world those are ours absolute sociopaths
20:57 Psychopaths right nationalism I believe
21:01 is a very important movement for 2018
21:03 and moving forward usually when you make
21:07 a big giant change in your life you know
21:11 sometimes you do whimsical things and it
21:12 works out oh my god
21:13 I just met this person and we eloped and
21:15 we you know we lived our whole life
21:18 together
21:19 it worked out yeah it's sort of like
21:21 saying I just bought one lottery ticket
21:23 and I totally won so let's go do it
21:25 again right doesn't quite work that way
21:27 right globalism is a massive change to
21:30 the way the world would work based on
21:32 the way the world has worked quite
21:33 successfully all of the spoils that are
21:38 being spent now are spoils that were
21:42 earned during nationalistic phases of
21:44 this world
21:45 why does Germany have the money it has
21:47 to pay off all the debts which it
21:49 doesn't have that much money of other
21:52 countries it's because the phase of the
21:54 deutsche mark within the confines of
21:56 nationalism the EU is something that's I
22:00 don't even know what year they started
22:01 developing it but it was in full swing
22:03 on paper in the 90s when someone who is
22:08 a banking family smells the paper right
22:12 off the printer but it's the the Charter
22:15 of globalism and they see the power
22:17 structure the amount of power increase I
22:20 should say that they're gonna have over
22:21 the world the amount of revenue they're
22:23 gonna have the amount of you know you've
22:25 got a chip in your body that says you
22:27 can't go anywhere and they got a chip
22:28 this has kissed my ass right they go
22:30 through every security they go anywhere
22:32 in the world but you can't they became
22:37 obsessed they became so elated with the
22:42 notion that this was the finest thing
22:44 they could do to
22:46 [ __ ] the world okay that they pushed it
22:49 out too quickly
22:50 thank God they pushed it out quick
22:54 enough that when how they didn't plan
22:57 very well and they certainly didn't get
22:59 the consensus of all the people of the
23:01 planet before they most likely through
23:03 votes in all the countries that became a
23:06 part of it now they're trying to throw
23:08 votes to keep all the countries in it
23:11 right they're trying to overthrow
23:14 England who has decided to brexit out of
23:16 it
23:17 smart England the Queen never got rid of
23:19 the pound sterling keep that in mind
23:21 she was like [ __ ] this this is never
23:23 gonna work out in a knot and I'm not
23:24 getting rid of my sovereign money which
23:27 is the most powerful money in this
23:28 country for this crap called the euro my
23:32 entire life people have talked about
23:35 traveling and being in other countries
23:39 and coming back and bragging about it
23:42 some people actually stay for a while
23:45 and actually understand it so they're
23:47 getting the most out of the game but why
23:50 do we travel why do we like meeting
23:53 people from another part of the world
23:54 because they're different and they have
23:57 spent thousands of years honing and
24:00 developing their culture their food
24:02 their fashion they live usually in a
24:04 geographical area that is different than
24:06 yours and so you get to enjoy Swiss Alps
24:09 or the beach that you never had a part
24:12 of or the islands of some other place
24:14 right globalism utterly nukes that
24:19 beautiful thing in humanity right now
24:24 the world is in this phase of everyone
24:27 trying to control everyone else's
24:29 thoughts through this virtue signaling
24:32 [ __ ] of the left progressives right
24:34 the list of words for political
24:38 correctness continues to evolve every
24:40 year once you learn the current list
24:43 that you got this morning on your fax
24:44 machine ha ha they will have another
24:48 list the next day that's slightly
24:50 different and because you can never keep
24:53 up with their [ __ ] they're always in
24:56 control of you and there are the only
24:58 ones that know what
24:59 is allowed to be said and what's not
25:01 allowed to be said they've got the
25:03 shaming chart stuff that you can't have
25:06 an opinion about because you'd be
25:08 shaming someone someone in the world
25:10 theoretically would be offended if they
25:12 heard the words coming out of your mouth
25:13 hmm when a globalism platform you have
25:19 that with an exponential multiplier that
25:23 would make everything that you do
25:25 potentially illegal and what happens
25:28 when you break the law hmm when you
25:31 break the law or they can come get you
25:33 they can come get you they can take
25:35 everything that you own take your kids
25:38 hold you and ransom in some [ __ ] jail
25:41 cell right and even if you're not truly
25:45 committing any crimes that would keep
25:47 you in prison forever well you never
25:50 know that jail could take a long time to
25:53 have your case heard to determine that
25:56 you should be set free there's people in
25:59 people excuse me NGO member jails where
26:01 you sit before you go to prison it's
26:03 when your case is being tried when you
26:05 are finally sentenced you go to a prison
26:07 that's we start serving your time oh
26:09 there's people in jail I think there's a
26:13 few people in America Benji almost a
26:14 decade because they keep appealing and
26:17 appealing and they can't get their case
26:18 sir and I think that they're innocent or
26:20 they claim that they're innocent well
26:23 the witch hunt could come for you if you
26:27 allow globalism to take over right a lot
26:31 of us don't like our children being fed
26:33 not only bad education but bad medicine
26:36 and having it forced on you by the state
26:38 right
26:39 these vaccinations that murder the
26:42 brains of your children murder their
26:44 bodies in a lot of cases give them brain
26:48 damage to the point they can say your
26:49 kid has autism and it's been in your
26:51 family forever and it's not our fault
26:54 nationalism is a way that you can
26:56 remotely protect that because your
26:58 country can pull its head out of its ass
27:00 which means less people in the world
27:02 have to pull their head out and
27:03 understand that genetically modified
27:06 food which was inserted into your diet
27:08 without your knowledge without your
27:09 approval fluoridated water which is
27:12 inserted into your
27:13 supply without your knowledge without
27:14 your approval bad air supply because
27:17 planes that leave white streaks and all
27:19 this other stuff that's going on if you
27:22 have to convince the entire planet or
27:23 two-thirds majority of 7.5 billion
27:27 people and growing that something needs
27:29 to be changed in your local region it'll
27:32 never happen and if they all decide
27:35 because of ignorance that you have to
27:38 take a shot that has a you know 50-50
27:42 chance of leaving you paraplegic or
27:44 something too bad too bad now I know
27:48 what you're saying if you're a globalist
27:51 you're saying well that's not the way it
27:52 works
27:52 you're lying to these people you're
27:54 manipulating them Germany can still pass
27:56 its own laws hmm you think so well it's
28:01 just like America for those of you who
28:02 are Americans you understand that your
28:04 state can pass laws as long as they
28:05 don't violate federal laws they can do
28:08 whatever they want underneath federal
28:10 order that's why the United States of
28:12 America has never as a country legalized
28:15 marijuana because allowing each
28:17 individual state to control that but if
28:20 the white house does legalize marijuana
28:22 then no state can tell you that you
28:24 can't use it because it's a federal law
28:28 what globalism is only in like day two
28:31 of this infant child that has been born
28:33 which is called the European Union I
28:37 think the child is uh struggling with
28:40 some SIDS right now and hopefully the
28:43 child of the globalist European Union
28:46 dies a swift death very soon and is
28:49 never reborn for as long as we're on
28:52 this planet thinking very different
28:54 thoughts right I've never heard in my
28:56 life more people say this is one hell of
28:59 a time to be alive some people are like
29:01 I'm glad I'm not missing the Great
29:03 Awakening I think that that's a very
29:07 interesting and profound and important
29:09 statement because I think that they're
29:11 right and I think there's been several
29:13 instances in history where this has been
29:15 the case but in the end the the final
29:20 word on their opinion of that of this
29:23 moment in time is how it actually ends
29:25 up
29:26 in the end what can we put in the ground
29:28 that can't be pulled out of the ground
29:30 that is good for mankind
29:32 that instills the do no harm principles
29:37 that hopefully were trying to live by
29:38 right it is my understanding my belief
29:45 that if North America and the European
29:47 coast never got pulled apart let's just
29:50 take that Atlantic Ocean and shrink it
29:52 and push these two continents back
29:54 together and you had 10 million unhappy
30:00 Arabs these people that have moved into
30:03 the European communities in England all
30:06 being ushered in by George Soros and his
30:08 hundred and sixty-seven corporations
30:11 that financed and manipulate everything
30:13 along the way if America whole East
30:17 Coast was up against Ihram these
30:20 immigrants would simply look at what can
30:22 I get for the least amount of effort and
30:25 that's where I'm going
30:27 so if America had a better gig over in
30:30 our country I'm not saying we do but if
30:32 we did attack we would never do what you
30:34 guys have done over there they would go
30:37 through Europe never stop and go
30:39 straight into the United States right so
30:42 what's analogous to this movement this
30:44 infiltration hmm we've got some people
30:47 who that their country go to [ __ ] and
30:50 you know there's some people that have
30:52 no country like the Kurds have no
30:54 country there's a little bit of sympathy
30:55 for some of those folks but again
30:58 they've got to fight it out they've got
31:00 to fight out for some land it sucks but
31:02 you just have to do it but there are
31:05 folks that are native to their land and
31:06 they don't like their leaders they don't
31:08 like the jobs they can get supposedly
31:11 the quality of life is not good enough
31:13 they think that we have something they
31:15 don't have so they're you want to come
31:17 over and get it for free not work just
31:20 create a little sanctuary city and again
31:22 they don't want to court a woman and get
31:25 her to like them they just take it and
31:27 they don't care if it's a child or an
31:29 adult they just take it right all right
31:34 well for those of you who've had kids or
31:36 you've been around kids and you see them
31:39 on everything for free they want to be
31:42 able to buy a guitar pick it up and play
31:45 it like Eddie Van Halen on the verse
31:47 first day if it takes more than five
31:50 minutes well screw this thing right it's
31:53 the same mentality I want what you have
31:56 I want to have to work for it gimme
31:58 gimme gimme and of course they'll blow
32:01 through all those resources really
32:02 quickly how many times have you heard a
32:05 story about a childhood friend of yours
32:07 that stole some money from a parent or
32:09 grandparent or found it somewhere or
32:11 stole it from somebody hundreds of
32:13 dollars maybe they got a credit card of
32:15 their parents and they ran off and they
32:17 blew a ton of cash and they got a ton of
32:18 things I just recently saw a video with
32:22 an Irish father disciplining his son for
32:24 having taken the credit card and went
32:26 out and just bought a ton of [ __ ]
32:28 right ton of stuff a rapper would say
32:30 you need to have right you know that
32:34 that would do your child more harm than
32:36 good it doesn't teach him to work hard
32:39 earn money and then buy things that you
32:41 need before you buy things that you want
32:43 when you have a bunch of free money you
32:45 tend to buy only things that you want
32:46 not things that you need well screw that
32:49 I'll spend my money on things that I
32:50 need I'll take their money and spend on
32:52 things that I want the biggest mistake
32:56 the biggest mistake that European Union
32:59 did was open up their borders at the
33:02 same time they're trying to create this
33:04 unified Europe
33:05 that's what's post everyone off that's
33:08 what screwed everything up and it's good
33:10 that they made those mistakes it's
33:12 fantastic that they're making this Mis
33:14 these mistakes right in front of
33:15 everyone so their America has no [ __ ]
33:18 doubt that what we're doing is much
33:21 better program it may not be the best
33:22 program but nationalism is going to be
33:25 the victor in this game I guarantee it
33:27 I don't know about other countries when
33:31 your national anthem plays and you stand
33:34 at attention and perhaps you put a hand
33:36 over your heart I'm not sure about other
33:38 countries if they do that but we do that
33:39 here in the United States shame on me
33:41 for not knowing about your country there
33:44 hasn't been a time that I focused on the
33:46 national anthem of the United States of
33:48 America the star-spangled banner
33:51 and I don't choke up by the time the
33:57 song is over right
33:59 I used to choke up as a kid because I
34:01 was extremely proud of what this country
34:02 was and now I choked up because I'm
34:05 thinking especially before this
34:07 awakening okay five years ago I was at a
34:09 baseball game I think it was a Dodger
34:12 game fire five to ten years ago and I'm
34:14 sitting there I'm listening to the
34:15 national anthem and I'm having this
34:17 choked up moment because I'm pissed off
34:21 that the thing that I used to get choked
34:23 up for is being destroyed by the
34:25 previous presidents you know the ones
34:27 between JFK and Trump now others hope
34:30 okay now there's things being done in
34:34 order to understand group identity it is
34:38 imperative that you understand your
34:39 individual identity who are you who are
34:43 you personally what do you stand for
34:45 obviously if you stand for if you don't
34:48 stand for something you stand for
34:50 nothing right that's the old saying and
34:51 it's it's written by very wise people
34:53 and is very very true I'm not sure you
34:57 can go into any household in the United
34:59 States of America of a meat eating
35:01 normal family okay and say if someone
35:06 came a foreigners pair trooped into your
35:08 neighborhood and you had a means to
35:10 defend yourself would you allow them to
35:13 take your country from you and force you
35:15 to the country next door would you allow
35:17 them to kill you and do whatever they
35:20 want with your family and your
35:21 possessions there's not a single person
35:24 in this country
35:25 I don't think again is a normal Center
35:29 to write American who wouldn't
35:32 instantaneously tell you I would do
35:35 anything to defend it I will die
35:38 defending what is mine and especially
35:41 the land that is the United States of
35:43 America because America is what it's an
35:47 idea in the minds of everyone but we
35:50 know that there have been invasions into
35:52 other countries during different wars
35:54 and the people just laid down took a nap
35:57 right they just laid down and said okay
35:59 whatever you want
36:00 here it is gee I hope we you know can
36:04 still do what we do
36:05 and then they want to [ __ ] about it
36:08 right
36:09 if Hitler was who the books say he was
36:12 and historians say he wasn't he lands in
36:15 Virginia and starts to push his little
36:17 Brit blitzkrieg all the way through
36:19 because he's got to get - I don't know
36:20 Kansas City Kansas or something in the
36:21 center of our country the only thing
36:24 that would be in the wake of his troops
36:27 if they were able to defeat us is a
36:28 bunch of dead Americans right he would
36:32 have to kill every single American that
36:35 came into his proximity because we
36:37 wouldn't stop fighting and we might
36:40 kamikaze the guy who might pull back and
36:42 strategize here and there for our own
36:45 attack sequence but we wouldn't give up
36:49 now there's been times that America has
36:51 been extremely weak and someone could
36:54 have probably rolled over our country if
36:55 they had a you know a fairly decent army
36:57 and it's happened right the war of 1812
37:00 is a goddamn disgrace in this country
37:03 it's probably the worst mistake it's
37:05 worth the first Federal Reserve sort of
37:08 Bank was turned back on after the lease
37:11 came up but several presidents since
37:13 then have been trying to fight him Taft
37:17 and Woodrow Wilson absolutely failed
37:19 this country
37:20 Taft because he was a skullenbones
37:22 traitor loyal to Europe and Woodrow
37:27 Wilson because he was a poor I think a
37:29 history professor or something like that
37:30 but he realized before he died that he
37:32 had sold his country out he [ __ ] us
37:35 all over without knowing it right poor
37:37 guy
37:38 now sometimes nationalism could be
37:40 viewed as a very racist entity and I
37:44 think for Europe it's a little bit
37:45 tougher now when he travelled in Europe
37:49 and the 80s for instance you had
37:51 predominantly those people living there
37:53 if there were Germans they were all
37:55 Germans are anglo-saxon white Germans
37:58 okay yeah there's a few immigrants here
38:00 and there but you don't have to be that
38:03 way right England is very nationalistic
38:07 it's trying to become more nationalistic
38:09 and there are huge conglomeration of
38:11 every race and Creed in the entire
38:13 planet same with America right
38:16 Australia is pretty good that way but
38:18 Australia is against
38:19 you know racism is used as this herding
38:24 wolf to the sheep that are the people
38:27 that they're trying to push into this
38:28 apparatus you have to not fall for it
38:31 and your best bet is not to try and
38:33 prove to someone that you're not racist
38:35 because you can't prove that you can't
38:37 someone starts saying something stupid
38:39 in the room you really have two choices
38:43 talk to them and waste your life or just
38:48 move on don't have the conversation
38:51 right I think it was Deanne 4tj ninjetta
38:55 alert this is what I was talking with an
38:57 idiot there's really nothing I can say
38:59 it's so true
39:01 but what organizations maintain the
39:05 force and the pressure that is thus
39:08 global istic mechanism well there's a
39:11 lot of them and I'm only going to skim
39:13 the top of the ones that I think are
39:15 easy low-hanging fruit I think because
39:19 it existed prior to the European Union
39:21 the United Nations is a very interesting
39:24 entity NATO is another one now in
39:29 principle they sound really cool the
39:31 idea is that of course we've got what is
39:34 it like 320 countries in this planet and
39:36 we all have to have a point I think
39:38 where we get to know each other we get
39:40 to share our objectives there are global
39:42 things we need to be concerned about
39:44 right you know I'm gonna mention a few
39:47 things that that have other things
39:49 attached to them trying to get lost in
39:51 them the other agendas well let's just
39:55 say we build nuclear power plants in
39:57 this planet America doesn't do it
39:59 anymore but the other countries do
40:01 Europe has a plan to build dozens and
40:03 dozens and dozens of them okay so it's
40:07 dangerous stuff when they go tits-up
40:10 they can launch a bunch of radioactive
40:12 substances into the air like Fukushima
40:15 they can dump a bunch of stuff into the
40:17 ocean killing off food and poisoning
40:20 everyone bluefin tunas are absolutely
40:23 not to be eaten
40:25 obviously dolphins aren't to be eaten
40:27 but they have a tremendous amount of
40:28 toxins in them as well
40:30 factories that have all kinds of crazy
40:32 chemicals that they just dumped into the
40:34 water and they rely on the property of
40:36 diffusion to get rid of the problem the
40:40 problem is little tiny fish he did
40:41 bigger fish eat that fish bigger fish
40:43 eat that fish and eventually it's super
40:45 concentrated in your sushi we have
40:48 factories just puking out huge horrible
40:51 clouds of toxins and you can get on the
40:54 whole bandwagon of climate change and
40:56 that kind of stuff we don't have to have
40:58 any sort of climate change [ __ ] to
41:02 simply decide that oil is a bad fuel and
41:04 that big smokestacks dumping out you
41:08 know megatons of carbon into the
41:09 atmosphere is something we should just
41:11 stop well in order to get the consensus
41:14 we've got to get together and share our
41:16 needs one country might say well we
41:19 would love to replace all of our
41:20 smokestacks with super scrubbers we just
41:22 can't afford it so hey guys if you guys
41:26 are rich we're poor if you want us to
41:28 replace our smokestacks how can we do it
41:30 I don't want you to screw me I don't
41:32 want you to get me in some stupid Ponzi
41:34 scheme loan where I go tits up in ten
41:36 years and I owe you my entire country in
41:38 return how are we gonna work on this let
41:41 me get together so having a global
41:44 organization where we all get together
41:45 and talk about things is great but the
41:47 problem is as long as you allow this
41:49 fungus this virus that is the banking
41:54 oligarchy of the world to exist in the
41:56 power capacity that they are well then
41:59 you've got a problem because you have a
42:01 centralized power system a sort of a
42:03 nervous system that distributes the
42:05 agendas for all countries to consider
42:08 and think about
42:09 they'll infiltrate it and they will make
42:12 it evil which is kind of what they've
42:15 done with the United Nations although I
42:18 have a couple good days and then a bunch
42:19 of bad days so it depends on what's
42:21 being discussed as to how harmful it's
42:24 gonna be now I'm the kind of person that
42:26 is interviewed all my relatives and
42:29 everyone I've ever met who's older than
42:31 me about what it was like to grow up in
42:34 their area of the United States and I
42:36 get down to all the details what was
42:39 school like what were their families
42:40 like what are the traditions like what
42:42 were the good things what were the bad
42:44 things
42:45 and it's almost I want to say it is
42:49 absolutely unanimous and all the stories
42:52 I've ever heard that it was always a
42:54 [ __ ] ton better and easier in the past
42:57 in this country of the United States of
42:59 America sure we have devices that make
43:03 life more entertaining and easier to
43:05 communicate in this day and age they're
43:06 not they're not talking about that being
43:08 a huge problem most of them are
43:10 extremely concerned about the lack of
43:12 human contact that is a problem but why
43:17 does it get worse and worse with time
43:19 is it the old No Country for Old Men
43:21 algorithm
43:22 you know the Elvis Presley is not on the
43:24 radio anymore problem no nothing to do
43:27 with that a lot of them talk about all
43:30 the products of the past the cars the
43:33 houses the appliances the clothing it
43:36 all lasted longer it was built to last
43:38 because people built it with national
43:41 pride made in America meant something
43:44 and then the economy was tossed up it
43:50 became more difficult to survive in
43:52 various pockets a five-year pocket there
43:54 a ten-year pocket there and then what
43:57 happens when the wallet is strained
43:58 within a family oh I got to get stuff
44:01 for cheaper because I don't have as much
44:03 money as I used to have per capita of
44:05 the power of money right and so they
44:08 said well I got this tub being China got
44:10 this tub be in Taiwan Japan Mexico yeah
44:14 you know how do you want to wear their
44:16 shirt anyway right how long do you
44:18 really want to stare at this particular
44:20 television or drive this particular car
44:22 you know you always get rid of it anyway
44:24 so why not just buy a car or a piece of
44:26 appliance or something that only lasts
44:28 for as long as you want to keep it and
44:30 you could throw it away later will tax
44:32 your ass for recycling it nationalism in
44:36 my opinion is a big giant mirror of
44:40 accountability for a particular group of
44:42 people that recognize themselves as a
44:44 particular nation America you look in
44:47 the mirror what is America
44:50 of course you get tons of propaganda
44:51 back and some of that's a bit necessary
44:54 right you got to create it you know your
44:56 your logo ours is like the American flag
44:58 in the
44:58 bald eagle your military will get in
45:01 there too how great you are cuz we can
45:02 blow the [ __ ] out of other people but a
45:05 lot of times what organizations like
45:06 NASA they're able to live off of the
45:10 nationalism wheelhouse right so we have
45:15 to be careful
45:16 within the nationalism definition but
45:20 again you're gonna have to be careful if
45:21 you call yourself nothing and you simply
45:23 have a little village up on a hill
45:25 somewhere trying to survive because
45:28 invariably someone will have different
45:30 opinion about how things should run and
45:33 I want to stress that because there's no
45:35 one way we could run the world
45:37 where everyone just magically gets along
45:40 it's an effort right and if you live in
45:43 a neighborhood with a bunch of neighbors
45:45 well we all have to adopt everyone
45:50 else's notion of what it's like to be in
45:52 a home some people want to party really
45:53 late some people want to go to bed at
45:55 9:00 o'clock
45:56 some people on fifty cars and only have
45:58 one parking space right but you find a
46:02 way to work it out and eventually in a
46:05 pinch like in the California fires these
46:09 neighbors come together instantaneously
46:11 and help each other out to the maximum
46:13 apex of their ability it's not to say
46:16 that we can't do this for the world as
46:18 well right
46:19 I think the prerequisite to globalism
46:23 would be one helping every nation become
46:27 fruitful within their particular area
46:30 right education is the freest thing that
46:34 we can give any human being to improve
46:36 their life I think most people agree on
46:37 that it's easier to do that than to go
46:41 and work two jobs and give half of the
46:44 money to these people that you want to
46:45 help you're not helping them at all
46:48 education teaches them how to fish for
46:51 themselves right but the banking
46:53 oligarchy work hard to make sure that
46:55 certain countries and certain continents
46:57 have no capability of maturing of moving
47:01 up in the world
47:02 they keep education away they keep
47:05 technology away they keep medicines away
47:08 well though given the medicines they
47:09 give them you know you know viral
47:12 diseases too
47:13 kill the ball or sterilize them all
47:14 they'll give those out all day but they
47:16 won't help them right
47:17 but obviously reaching into someone
47:20 else's nation is something that has to
47:21 be only by invite what if one nation
47:25 says have as many kids as you possibly
47:27 can forever every Thai FAK they hold a
47:30 gun to everyone's head and say you need
47:32 to have ten kids in like 14 years well
47:37 they would over populate and straw the
47:40 very balance that we have in this world
47:43 they've run out of resources and they'd
47:44 all start dying off and then what's
47:46 gonna happen
47:47 maybe they try to invade their neighbors
47:49 hmm so how can we take that very
47:54 difficult problem on a nationalism level
47:56 and solve it with a globalism level well
48:00 your bankers step in and they say oh
48:02 that's exactly why we want globalism
48:04 we're gonna move in and regulate
48:06 everything hmm
48:08 all with the promise that having become
48:13 a global istic society these problems
48:16 would disappear in their native areas
48:17 there wouldn't be any need for a bunch
48:19 of migrants to move anywhere because it
48:22 would be fixed in their backyard and
48:23 it'd be fixed with magic dirt theory
48:26 right instantaneously when you join the
48:29 European Union your dirt becomes magical
48:31 where you're standing there's jobs
48:33 there's social welfare education isn't
48:40 working out is it the countries that
48:41 were smart and prosperous well they're
48:44 all suffering compared to how prosperous
48:46 they would have been had they stayed out
48:48 of the European Union in the first place
48:49 and again there's a lot of folks that
48:52 believe it's going to take a hundred two
48:54 hundred maybe more years to get this
48:56 thing working that all the suffering now
48:58 is just something we're gonna have to
48:59 tolerate well in my experience the
49:03 people that professed profess so much
49:09 are those that are in their twilight
49:12 years their golda tears they've already
49:16 lived their nationalistic life they've
49:19 had all the spoils when the spoils were
49:21 supposed to be there right so
49:25 they care if all the kids of today never
49:28 experienced that beauty of nationalism
49:32 because we're talking about let's say it
49:34 takes a hundred years a hundred years
49:37 for this globalism experiment called the
49:40 European Union to work out and let's say
49:43 the average kid has a baby their first
49:45 child at 25 you're talking about four
49:47 generations living in anything but a
49:51 prosperous era such that the fifth
49:53 generation can potentially write because
49:56 it's only going to start turning around
49:57 the in the fifth generation right we
50:00 have technology now that we hadn't we
50:02 couldn't have dreamed about say 50 years
50:05 ago maybe 50 years ago 100 years ago
50:08 let's just say Arthur she Clark did do a
50:10 pretty good job predicting how the
50:11 internet would be used at one point in
50:12 the 60s I think was 1969 which is 50
50:17 years ago right roughly what we have
50:20 been tried is nationalism with all the
50:22 technology that we have the conversion
50:25 of money banking in general imagine you
50:28 could get rid of debt based loans you
50:33 can get rid of compound interest you
50:35 make it illegal in your nation and then
50:37 your nation prospers like crazy because
50:39 when you borrow money you borrow from
50:41 your country there's perhaps a fee
50:44 associated with it right you borrow $100
50:46 you're gonna owe back 120 there's a 20%
50:49 of the money you're borrowing it doesn't
50:52 ever increase right there's no financial
50:56 penalties for not paying it back there's
50:58 just your inability to borrow any more
51:01 money from your country for a particular
51:03 time and you have to show some aptitude
51:05 and employment you have to show some
51:07 ability to save money and because
51:09 bankers wouldn't be investing your money
51:11 in crap you could get really good
51:13 interest rates on your money in a bank
51:14 account so you could have a savings
51:16 account that actually ends up saving
51:18 your ass when you're old right every
51:21 nation on earth as a nationalistic form
51:25 of society could experiment with
51:27 formulas to make them prosper and there
51:29 wouldn't be anything illegal
51:31 with say Germany a bunch of extremely
51:34 brilliant people looking at all the
51:37 mechanisms think
51:39 about it for a little while and going ah
51:40 we have it now that we're no longer
51:42 infested with these oligarchy families
51:45 because they've all been arrested
51:46 they've all been killed or whatever
51:48 happens to them right taken out of
51:51 powers all they need to have happen as
51:53 long as they're alive they're gonna
51:54 scheme and [ __ ] with us so hmm might be
51:57 a little bit of like a planet Gitmo to
52:00 send them to right but Germany figures
52:03 out how to do something beautiful how to
52:05 run their money and they publish it in
52:08 the you know is on a mystery and so
52:10 every other country can go let's do it
52:12 let's do exactly that part of what
52:14 Germany has done maybe America figures
52:17 out how to fix public transit when so
52:20 everyone goes let's do what America does
52:22 for public transit meanwhile America is
52:23 borrowing Germans Germany's mechanism
52:25 for managing money on and on and on down
52:29 every single strategic resource that a
52:31 country needs to survive from farming to
52:34 education to medicine to science and
52:37 eventually once we start borrowing from
52:40 each other and prospering guess what
52:42 happens people we would naturally while
52:46 maintaining national borders come to
52:48 this you know maybe a thousand years or
52:51 I don't know how long it would take we
52:53 would all come to this peak where we're
52:55 behaving very similarly you go into
52:59 Africa which has countries that are just
53:02 starving to death right South America
53:05 countries that are in absolute ruin down
53:07 there right of course they've been put
53:09 into ruin by these same organizations
53:11 and people that I'm talking about but in
53:14 the end we start leveling the playing
53:15 field for everybody they have to do the
53:18 work right they have to develop children
53:20 that read books and go get PhDs and
53:23 immediately start it for those that have
53:25 been weathered through the old systems
53:27 or like oh my god I know exactly how to
53:29 turn on this new system because I've
53:30 been in the old crappy banking system
53:31 for a really long time this one's easier
53:33 and more simple if an income-tax needed
53:37 to be collected from its citizens well
53:39 you got to write a constitution that
53:40 allows it to occur and then you have to
53:43 simplify the tax codes simplify
53:45 everything don't give away a bunch of
53:47 tax breaks to major corporations without
53:52 a good day
53:53 reason to do it right mankind is not
53:56 ready for globalization then again we're
53:59 not ready for a couple reasons above all
54:02 the other reasons is you could most
54:03 likely site we have evil people running
54:06 the planet who have been running it for
54:07 several hundred years if not several
54:10 thousand years we know of the last 300
54:12 years we know exactly who they are in
54:15 some cases right but - as a people we're
54:20 not on the same page we're not on the
54:22 same page within a nation and we're not
54:24 on the same page across nations to be
54:26 pretending like we are so civilized
54:29 right those of you who work extremely
54:32 long hours perhaps some of you they have
54:34 to maintain more than one job I have a
54:36 friend of mine she just recently took a
54:39 third job she's a single bomb and she's
54:42 having to take a third job to make
54:44 things work and I see her maybe once a
54:46 month because she's working constantly
54:48 and she barely complains she's an
54:50 amazing woman but she's got to do that
54:54 because our nation of America in
54:58 California has got issues right it's not
55:01 a dumb girl fact that she's a very smart
55:03 girl she's very determined she works
55:05 really hard but now as a nation do we
55:09 look at this person working that much
55:12 and we don't move in to try and change
55:14 our nation to make sure that that's not
55:15 a problem right that we look at someone
55:18 go really you got to work three jobs
55:19 okay now what's going on here right we
55:22 need to get you an educational track
55:23 where you can learn one skill that pays
55:25 enough money that you can live and pay
55:30 for yourself and your daughter right
55:32 just one kid right and herself there's
55:35 similar stories and worse stories all
55:37 over the planet people willing to work
55:41 people who are smart suffering the
55:44 solution is not for us to join the
55:46 European Union and for Germany to send
55:50 some of its BMW money over to her house
55:52 and say we're just gonna give you a
55:54 bunch of money right these these new
55:55 incomes that they're trying to create
55:57 around the world which have unanimously
55:58 failed the name escapes me but there's a
56:02 name for it where cities states and
56:05 countries are giving
56:07 out two people it's been going on for a
56:10 very long time while I watched after
56:13 George Michael died I saw a little bio
56:17 on him and they said one of his first
56:18 songs that became famous was the song
56:22 that he wrote about his buddy in the
56:23 band Wham he was from a fairly affluent
56:26 family but the kid
56:27 the brunette kid qualified for some
56:30 state funding and he was sucking the
56:32 system dry and I was like dry but he was
56:35 sucking the system for checks that he
56:37 really didn't need because his parents
56:38 actually made enough money to subsidize
56:40 his life and he obviously made enough
56:42 money or had excuse me had enough of a
56:44 brain to go out and earn his own income
56:47 but he wanted to be a musician and so he
56:50 milked the system until he did become a
56:51 musician come on how many thousands of
56:55 children try to become something without
56:58 the proper guidance and they don't they
57:00 don't they never become it so if they
57:03 had the socialistic system to live off
57:04 of they'd never get off of it right
57:07 sorry reset them get old Bernie Sanders
57:11 right the guy has manipulated the system
57:15 to live off the system his entire life I
57:17 think he was a carpenter for a little
57:18 while then he moved up through a bunch
57:21 of political positions and eventually
57:23 became the senator of Vermont of course
57:27 that guy wants socialism it's been the
57:29 very way he has existed his entire life
57:31 and now he takes payoffs from the
57:34 Clinton administration to allow him to
57:37 have his votes stolen at least in
57:39 California and Colorado right he got
57:41 himself a big fat Audi right on that
57:44 note I think it's very very important
57:47 that we do things in this world because
57:49 we believe again if you look in the
57:51 mirror and you figure out who you are
57:52 that we do things because we believe
57:55 that that is the right thing to do
57:56 personally right again if you're not
58:00 really going to be making the sacrifices
58:02 that you're asking other people to make
58:03 then shut the [ __ ] up I mean seriously
58:06 right these very rich celebrities
58:08 that'll never be poor you know voting in
58:11 a campaigning for taxes and socialism
58:13 believe me they're gonna have their own
58:15 money to never live inside that
58:17 situation in your life
58:18 right you shouldn't do it because you
58:21 like Donald Trump you should do it
58:22 because you think it is the right way to
58:26 behave and you must have done hopefully
58:28 your research hopefully you've done your
58:29 research to validate alternatives right
58:34 I think most of you know that at the end
58:39 of the day it's what you've accomplished
58:42 in that day that will make you feel
58:43 amazing and you know you may have worked
58:48 really really hard all year long you're
58:49 taking a one week vacation and so you
58:51 might say well you know when I go to
58:53 Hawaii you want to go to some other
58:55 exotic place in the world that I like
58:56 you I love crawling into that those
59:00 crisp sheets in a hotel at this whatever
59:03 Club Med or whatever wherever you are in
59:05 the world and you're like that's the
59:06 best day I have in my life that I fight
59:09 all year long to have that one-week
59:11 thing I'm not talking about that I'm
59:14 talking about when you actually are
59:15 quote-unquote working and you get done
59:18 within the day and you're like I made a
59:19 difference I help my company I help my
59:22 own company I helped an employee help my
59:25 child do their homework that's when you
59:28 feel the best you will ever feel in your
59:30 life and that's simply human nature that
59:36 is human nature the Robin Hood promise
59:40 of globalism is that only a few people
59:45 will work really really hard and their
59:47 wealth will be distributed to you and
59:49 you won't have to work you'll just sit
59:52 on your ass I guarantee you if that was
59:56 something that happened and it happens a
59:58 lot with people that win the lottery
59:59 they went a tremendous amount of money
60:01 and they go from you know slaving at
60:04 some job to not working at all now again
60:07 I think over 90% of them lose all of the
60:10 money I had a friend of mine in a
60:13 previous business that's mother won the
60:16 lottery some 25 years ago and she had
60:18 done a great job managing her wealth but
60:21 that super rare right I mean if it if
60:25 winning the lottery really worked out
60:27 then Shark Tank would be full of a bunch
60:29 of lottery winners but there's not
60:31 enough I don't think there's enough
60:32 wealthy lottery winners after ten years
60:34 to fill up a single shark tank panel of
60:37 like six people because they didn't earn
60:40 it they don't know how to make the money
60:42 besides picking the same numbers over
60:45 and over and over again
60:46 now I celebrate the people that went you
60:49 know that's a great thing and I hope
60:51 their lives are wonderful and I hope
60:52 they don't lose their money I'm not
60:53 trying to say that but if you built an
60:56 entire world out of socialism which is
60:58 essentially what globalism runs on right
61:01 globalism is like the overall name of
61:05 the product but the platform it runs on
61:07 is socialism right stealing from the
61:11 rich and giving to the poor well
61:13 obviously we know bad rich people
61:15 there's tons of them but I know a lot of
61:18 rich people that have worked their asses
61:20 off for their money even ones that I
61:23 don't have a I've had some business
61:26 partners who were extremely wealthy and
61:28 I didn't have a tremendously positive
61:30 attitude towards them after we were done
61:32 doing business but in the end you know I
61:35 have more than 51 percent total respect
61:37 for their frugal nough sweat their money
61:40 because as one of my partner's told me
61:43 he goes it's very hard to make money
61:45 okay so if you see me rich across the
61:48 table don't be sitting there with your
61:49 handout and just saying well you got all
61:52 this might you could solve this problem
61:53 for us give us your money this is every
61:56 dollar is very hard to make and if it
61:57 wasn't hard to make then you would have
61:59 a bunch of money right it is my Curtin
62:03 opinion at my age right now okay that
62:06 the most balanced world we could
62:09 possibly have and I don't know what you
62:11 call it but I think that nationalism is
62:14 the closest thing I've ever seen to
62:16 getting a large group of people in every
62:19 area of the world and they're a little
62:21 nation right achieving this would be you
62:27 have a job hopefully a single income
62:30 household is all that is mandatory okay
62:32 if you know let's take a traditional
62:35 family father mother and some kids the
62:39 father is traditionally the one that
62:42 goes out and works because he doesn't
62:44 give birth to the children the children
62:45 aren't mother
62:46 goosed to the father in most cases right
62:48 of course daddy's little girl not a
62:50 logarithm but for the most part all
62:52 children are bound to their mother at
62:54 the beginning I think we need to create
62:56 a job structure such that the father can
62:59 bring home one income feel wonderful
63:02 about his day he has the the wherewithal
63:05 and the intelligence to reward his wife
63:06 for her amazing accomplishment which is
63:09 keeping the family together which may
63:11 for both of them look very repetitive
63:13 right he may not land you know some big
63:17 giant multi-billion dollar deal he just
63:19 makes donuts but he made awesome donuts
63:21 and he made everyone happy in the
63:23 morning so got my fixed shoes but man
63:26 you know and you wear a good pair of
63:27 shoes and you can point that dude right
63:29 there that fixed your shoes it's awesome
63:32 obviously women will always be in the
63:34 workforce some will choose never to have
63:36 families and they earn more money than
63:38 men by the way never married never
63:41 before married woman meaning never had
63:43 children
63:43 makes I think well as of the 80s they'd
63:48 be two thousand dollars more a year than
63:49 a man a man was making roughly about
63:52 eighteen thousand dollars a year and a
63:53 woman was making twenty she had the same
63:55 exact work experience mm-hmm I'm getting
63:59 into Thomas Sowell this stuff is amazing
64:02 but how do we ensure that people have
64:05 that capability well one we need an
64:07 economy that's stable economy that is
64:10 controlled by the nation itself and is
64:12 never ever exported to another nation or
64:16 a group of families they control them
64:19 but you ever walk around your own house
64:22 and just set fires randomly hell no you
64:25 keep your house in check you keep it
64:27 healthy you work on it you keep it clean
64:29 you fix a leaky window a leaky faucet
64:31 whatever right but when you sub that out
64:34 to someone else who knows doesn't have
64:36 to live in the house mm-hmm well they're
64:38 gonna do whatever the hell they want and
64:40 if they can extort something out of you
64:42 in the process they will right power
64:44 corrupts absolutely remember that that's
64:47 why nations have to control themselves
64:48 right but for that family to live a
64:51 beautiful life and everyone to tuck
64:53 themselves in at night and say I've been
64:55 a great mother I would and great husband
64:57 and hey I've been a good kid too
64:59 they're gonna need a good education
65:01 right in order to pay someone a high
65:04 wage well the company that's paying them
65:06 whether it be their own or someone
65:07 else's company has to earn enough money
65:09 to share the profits
65:12 well great company is always built by
65:14 grapevines right the Steve Jobs taught
65:17 the corporate world at the 80s you only
65:20 hire a players right any players are
65:24 willing to hire people that know more
65:25 than they do you don't tell an a player
65:28 what to do you listen to an a player
65:29 tell you what you should do because the
65:33 B player hires D players right very
65:36 important algorithm they have a
65:38 narcissistic wave inside their body
65:40 because they didn't get educated enough
65:42 either socially or academically to be
65:48 willing to sit in a room with someone
65:49 that knows something more than they do
65:50 because they don't see the overall
65:52 picture on the overall reward of hanging
65:54 out with people smarter than they are
65:56 and sharing the journey along the way
65:57 because they know something that the
66:00 other people don't know
66:01 and together you become mighty and
66:04 amazing we want every person on this
66:07 planet to have a job that doesn't feel
66:10 like a job because it is what they love
66:12 to do believe it or not there are people
66:15 that love digging ditches picking up
66:17 trash cans it's simple it's it's hard
66:20 it's physically tough but for them when
66:23 they stuck themselves in at night they
66:25 cleaned all the dirt out of their
66:26 fingernails in the shower
66:28 they've got happy kids hafiz about happy
66:31 spouses and they're satisfied and we
66:35 have to remember that like I said in a
66:37 previous episode I had a goober driver
66:40 in the bay area he was from the
66:42 Philippines no sorry he was from Vietnam
66:44 excuse me and he said he came from the
66:46 jungles of Vietnam he had been in the
66:49 Bay Area for about six years
66:50 drivin uber and he said he was moving
66:53 back he had a pretty good gig he had a
66:55 really nice car brand-new car and I said
66:57 really
66:58 after all this technology and modern
67:00 stuff he goes I said are you really
67:02 gonna move back and he said yeah I said
67:04 why and he goes because even though the
67:07 average person in my community makes
67:09 about a dollar 50 a day he said we live
67:12 much better life than all these people
67:14 here all of you he said and I said
67:17 really
67:17 he said yeah because this whole thing
67:19 about a poverty index all around the
67:21 world and America trying to control what
67:23 Chinese people make he says it's all
67:25 [ __ ] they have as much as they need
67:28 and they live wonderful peaceful lives
67:31 he says everybody in my village sees
67:33 their entire family all day long and
67:35 even the families that are living next
67:38 to them are their families right a lot
67:40 of neighborhoods around the world behave
67:42 like this as well but they're figuring
67:45 out for themselves what works for them
67:48 but what if globalism stretched to
67:50 Vietnam then a bunch of bankers came in
67:54 and said well this isn't gonna work we
67:56 have to cut down all these trees to turn
67:57 them into chopsticks or whatever because
67:59 we're gonna sell them these people look
68:01 how lazy they are I don't care if
68:04 they're happy they need to work as hard
68:06 as I do because I have imposed on myself
68:08 an unhappy life and they have to be as
68:11 unhappy as me all right like the Vogon
68:13 captain when you live in perhaps a
68:16 really small community right like I grew
68:19 up in Kansas I could drive anywhere in
68:21 Kansas and as long as they recognized me
68:23 as a fellow kanzen and I talked to them
68:26 they realized uh well you live up there
68:28 oh yeah I know you guys are a little bit
68:30 different than us but for the most part
68:31 we got the same kind of industries you
68:33 have and were hey you know shake your
68:35 hand I mean this is my daughter or
68:37 whatever right when you live in a big
68:39 state like California you have very
68:43 distinct regions right you have a
68:47 Southern California which is very
68:50 relaxed on one level but very intense on
68:52 another level because you have to work
68:54 hard and you have to you know earn a
68:55 fairly decent income to live in this
68:57 area then you go up to the Bay Area
68:59 where you have to learn earn twice as
69:01 much money and it's super super tough
69:04 super intense right it's a job well it's
69:08 a dog-eat-dog world for all the jobs
69:10 that are up there then you go up to
69:12 Tahoe well without your kind of back in
69:15 Colorado or Kansas you know pickup
69:17 trucks everywhere you know everyone
69:19 drinks Coors Light or Bud Light that's
69:21 about it no designer beers up there I'm
69:23 being facetious
69:24 of course but it's different all in one
69:27 state they want to split this state and
69:30 to fact one jerk-off wants to split the
69:32 state into three because he wants all
69:34 the electoral college to favor his
69:36 leftist Progressive Party of course now
69:40 having lived in this state for over
69:43 thirty years I will say that we probably
69:46 do need to split California into
69:48 Northern California and Southern
69:49 California probably right around the
69:51 point that saintly st. Louis Obispo
69:53 exists I'm not sure which side they want
69:56 to be a part of that's probably the
69:57 splitting point because we do have
69:59 completely different views between the
70:02 two top and the cool thing is is they're
70:04 pretty unified north and we're pretty
70:06 unified south you know but we're still
70:08 very different within our local cities
70:11 right to bring it up an analogy in
70:14 closing here you know what Verner von
70:17 Braun the gentleman that architected the
70:20 Saturn 5 initially reported into the
70:24 White House again this was in some
70:25 history special so I assume what I'm
70:27 saying is true I have not read any
70:28 documents to prove this so I apologize
70:31 if this is me carrying something for
70:32 that wasn't true but just as an analogy
70:34 it has value regardless he said he
70:37 wanted to go to Mars as his first
70:39 journey out because he was thinking a
70:40 planet to planet travel I'm assuming and
70:44 the White House said well let's go for
70:45 the moon first right okay well though
70:49 how did we supposedly get there right a
70:52 lot of us don't think we did but we had
70:55 to do a bunch of little experiments I
70:57 mean thousands and thousands of
70:59 experiments with different rockets you
71:01 know achieving low orbit first and then
71:04 figuring how to do more low orbit and
71:07 deal with all the anomalies it is the
71:10 humble opinion of your narrator that
71:14 going to globalism in the 21st century
71:17 is tantamount to trying to travel to the
71:20 next Galaxy let alone the next moon it's
71:24 too big of a step for man's intellect at
71:26 this point but of course that's what a
71:30 lot of folks that I have talked to from
71:32 Europe and her conversations third party
71:35 about the globalism issue
71:37 in Europe that's what they want to hold
71:40 up is that they can conceive of it so we
71:43 should do it right a lot of folks can
71:46 easily conceive of socialism working in
71:49 a perfect world or everyone's behaving
71:51 and everyone's on the same page but we
71:53 know we're not all on the same page or
71:56 not on the same page in a car full of
71:58 four people who are not on the same page
72:00 in a house full of four people let alone
72:02 a city a state or a nation let alone a
72:06 planet or continent right we have a
72:10 tremendous amount of social working and
72:12 social development to do in my opinion
72:15 before we're going to be ready for
72:17 anything more than what we've been
72:19 practicing which is nationalism take the
72:23 history of any one of the countries that
72:24 you know of that are considered first
72:26 world countries and just look up their
72:28 history look at the civil wars that
72:30 they've gone through you can have a
72:31 civil war like we had at the 1800s
72:33 between the north and the south
72:35 that's that's a very physical blatant
72:39 definition of a civil war
72:40 but remember England in the 70s the coal
72:44 miners strike coal miners brought the
72:47 whole country to its knees by striking
72:49 it was their predominant energy source
72:51 burning coal to create electricity well
72:54 that's a little tiny difference between
72:56 some coal miners getting screwed for bad
72:58 pay and yet there they have this black
73:00 lung that they get they die early
73:02 the making this gigantic sacrifice and
73:05 quarter it you know according to
73:07 importance of a particular nation the
73:09 highest paying job in the in the entire
73:12 country of England should have been the
73:13 coal miners more so than a physicist at
73:16 Cambridge University but you know that
73:19 wasn't the case right why because
73:23 bankers don't respect people that do
73:25 blue-collar work well you're you know
73:28 what their definition would be you're
73:30 stupid that's why you dig coal you don't
73:33 have the ability to do anything else
73:34 obviously it's not true perhaps their
73:38 family got into it a long time ago and
73:40 they just continue the trend
73:41 perhaps they live next to a coal mining
73:43 industry so why not go into it it's
73:44 right there in my backyard I don't want
73:46 to leave where I live I won't have to
73:48 move to to London to get this big fancy
73:50 job
73:52 hmm most countries have a Left Party and
73:55 a right party and a centrist party an
73:57 independent party in a green party of
73:58 some sort
74:00 well that means they're not getting
74:01 along that you have different
74:03 philosophies
74:03 perhaps they are getting along but they
74:05 do fight in Parliament's and Senate
74:08 houses and they're all trying to get on
74:09 the same page but now if I were to ask
74:12 any person in America when do you think
74:15 as a nationalistic country in the
74:19 smallest form of our identity is
74:22 nationalism when do you think then left
74:24 in the right will simply disappear
74:26 there'll be no independent party agree
74:28 and party and we will simply be the
74:30 party of America and we all can come to
74:33 the to the table and say this is what we
74:35 want to do and when do we want to do it
74:38 let's just prioritize everything that we
74:39 want to do even the prioritization is
74:41 easy because we're all on the same page
74:42 every single one of you should have just
74:45 laughed a little bit because we are
74:49 centuries centuries away from that right
74:52 but now what if I challenged every one
74:55 of you listening with solving that
74:57 problem how do we get everyone on the
74:59 same page as quickly as possible what
75:04 does that answer if there's a bonus if
75:07 you guys get it right according to me of
75:10 course my subjective opinion my biased
75:13 opinion someone someone try to yell at
75:15 me in the in those comments you have a
75:17 bias you're being biased was like of
75:19 course it's the me show I'm very sorry
75:22 it's just the me show what else can I do
75:23 I don't know what everyone else is
75:25 thinking
75:26 again we're not on the same page ooh
75:27 what the the irony I believe that the
75:31 only way we can remotely get on the same
75:33 page is through education we have to
75:36 learn about our own needs first
75:38 and then we have to learn about the
75:39 needs of others second and we have to
75:42 find a way to prioritize both equally
75:46 obviously if you're suffering you got to
75:48 take care of number one you got a fire
75:50 coming down the hill at your house and
75:51 you're gonna be worried about some kid
75:53 learning physics in a different state
75:55 right you need to get out of your house
75:57 but the fire out whatever you got to do
75:58 you got to save your life right
76:00 a lot of Californians are looking at
76:02 their life a completely different way
76:03 and there are people that did
76:05 have to suffer losing their home at all
76:06 but watching others suffer there I don't
76:10 think there's a single person in
76:11 California that isn't a mini prepper now
76:14 because they can burn your house down at
76:18 any point in time right through all
76:22 kinds of means and you lose your whole
76:25 history especially since it's all
76:26 digital now right you know uploading
76:28 everything to some cloud and your house
76:30 burns down well and their goodbyes
76:31 goodbye to your photographs that you had
76:33 printed out right if a nation can't
76:37 solve its problems by itself then simply
76:40 compounding the problem through
76:41 globalism and especially some paradigm
76:44 shift to the mind rotting soul rotting
76:48 socialism where you have everyone
76:50 sitting at home just collecting their
76:52 paycheck from some phantom source
76:54 playing video games and getting fat
76:57 remember again the third third act of
76:59 wall-e the movie by Pixar the people
77:03 were all in these floating cars none of
77:06 them had walked in their entire lifetime
77:08 and they did this x-ray on their body
77:11 and their bone density because they
77:12 hadn't used their bodies they'd almost
77:14 run out of bones what I'm even connected
77:17 it was the most brilliant third act of a
77:19 writer I have seen in a very very long
77:22 time probably since bug's life right my
77:25 entire life as a sort of joking gesture
77:27 people have it's been on TV a lot as
77:31 comedies has been in movies but people
77:33 do it in real life and they'll toast to
77:35 world peace and that's a great idea but
77:38 every time you toast a world peace you
77:40 sort of make anyone who's intelligent in
77:41 the room feel like [ __ ] because you
77:43 realized oh my god that's gonna take
77:46 forever
77:47 but I think if we started toasting to
77:49 something a little more close to home
77:51 you know getting along in your community
77:54 I don't know what that toast would sound
77:56 like but something very localized to
77:58 your group of people maybe the people in
78:00 my household Hulk I'll get along today
78:02 people my work get along people in my
78:04 town get along then your County than
78:07 your state they might be on the right
78:10 track we're not gonna go to Mars on the
78:13 first day folks we haven't even figured
78:15 out how to go to the moon have we we
78:18 got some pretty good ideas don't let
78:21 anyone guilt you out of your camaraderie
78:25 and identity that is your nation don't
78:29 let anyone take away your culture
78:30 especially because that's what globalism
78:32 will do that is the imperative of
78:35 globalism the campaigning Mexican food
78:38 German food American food
78:40 it's got to be food right it's gonna be
78:43 some assembly line of I'll take the gray
78:46 sludge that has more chunks in it versus
78:49 the gray sludge that is like a drinking
78:51 protein shake right if you think I'm
78:55 kidding you're kidding yourself part of
78:58 slowing down globalism and eventually
79:01 killing it for now is really thinking
79:05 through what your definition is I hope
79:08 you guys have better definitions and
79:09 better benefits and like cost-benefit
79:11 analysis of nationalism so that you can
79:15 highlight the to-do list that is more
79:18 immediate than the one that they're
79:19 presenting I'm gonna do an episode this
79:22 year about microchipping
79:23 human beings I think I might I don't in
79:25 the past I need to look that up but
79:27 there are people in Europe we're having
79:32 microchips put in their bodies for
79:35 benefits that of course are like I think
79:37 the first one I heard two or three years
79:39 ago was putting chips in their bodies so
79:41 they can get into nightclubs faster
79:43 right Wow what priorities do they do
79:46 they have over there right shreds a
79:48 small group of people I think we have to
79:51 get our senses extremely heightened when
79:54 it comes to matters of how we legislate
79:58 and enforce the way that sovereign
80:01 people live their lives when those type
80:04 of laws are being passed they control
80:07 your economy they control your
80:09 day-to-day life inside your own
80:11 household
80:11 they control again what chemicals are
80:14 putting your children children our
80:17 sovereign people too and believe it or
80:19 not it is my belief that a parent has no
80:21 goddamn right to put something in it he
80:24 another human beings body that will
80:26 potentially affect them for the rest of
80:28 their lives
80:28 and the idea that it only takes a
80:31 brochure
80:32 or commercial on TV to get a parent to
80:34 do it is mind-blowing
80:36 right I know celebrity friends of mine
80:38 that have children and all their
80:40 children got the minor most Mayer dose
80:43 of any vaccinations
80:44 you know polio the kind of stuff I got
80:46 as a kid so their kid is fine but they
80:49 haven't looked at the difference between
80:51 the time that their kid got shots and
80:53 the time the kids get shots today but
80:55 they'll run around online and use their
80:57 fame to push things that will murder
81:00 children right once again I mentioned
81:03 this in the past but once you give a
81:04 child a vaccination that gives them
81:07 brain damage and leaves them in a state
81:09 that the hospital then blames on autism
81:11 to get out the legal liability of what
81:12 they've done to your child that family
81:15 is under constant financial strain for
81:18 the rest of their life I have to take
81:20 care of a child one of my best friends
81:22 in the whole planet he has a younger
81:24 brother who's now I believe 30 and he's
81:29 a big kid but they're not quite sure how
81:31 it happened but he's now on this
81:33 autistic care 24/7 and at all times the
81:39 entire family has to adjust their lives
81:41 to take care of this this child it
81:46 wasn't fair to him and it wasn't fair to
81:49 them it was all built up through hype
81:52 anyway I hope you feel me on this
81:54 subject it's a very controversial
81:56 subject so I'm bound to get a lot of
81:57 thumbs down in this particular one I
82:00 want to hear from you guys because
82:02 you're literally one of the best
82:04 communities I've ever found online and I
82:06 feel extremely privileged to be at the
82:09 center of all your input if you haven't
82:13 been to deep thoughts radio.com please
82:15 go that's where you can find the audio
82:16 the video the locked Facebook group and
82:19 the patreon page for those of you
82:20 support the show in any way shape or
82:23 form I appreciate it especially those of
82:24 you guys who have those of you who have
82:27 stuck with me since the very beginning
82:28 and have seen every episode or seen some
82:31 of them two or three times believe me if
82:34 we were in a different world we'd all
82:36 live in a big giant deep thoughts
82:37 community and share our stories and we'd
82:40 have a thousand shows with a bunch of
82:42 different folks but for now take care of
82:44 yourself and someone
82:45 sensing the next deep thoughts over now
