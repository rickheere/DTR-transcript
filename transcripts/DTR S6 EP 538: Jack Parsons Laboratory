00:35 welcome back
00:36 ladies and gentlemen to deep thoughts
00:38 man it's been a few days since i've
00:39 recorded
00:42 uh the main reason why that occurred was
00:45 that we had some
00:46 super duper winds and i mean people have
00:49 been here their whole life
00:51 50 60 70 years were telling me this is
00:53 the most room you've ever had
00:55 it was blowing down people's fences and
00:57 all kinds of stuff
00:59 and then we got a bunch of rain so
01:02 i apologize for any type of delay but i
01:06 am brewing so much man
01:07 we're gonna have a good time i think the
01:10 next cause i've been doing this kind of
01:11 thing where i'm telling you the next
01:12 video i'm going to do
01:14 it doesn't mean there won't be videos in
01:16 between because i do have one in reserve
01:18 to drop in between it's a little
01:20 cerebral one
01:22 but the next big one i want to do is i
01:25 pet goat 2
01:26 analysis it's a very old video
01:29 but it's miraculous how many people
01:31 haven't seen it
01:32 and how utterly kooky it is and now
01:35 we're going back into cookie
01:37 in america so should be very interesting
01:41 however got plenty of kooky
01:44 right here in this this particular video
01:47 now i think i'm gonna call this
01:50 jack parsons laboratory some of you
01:53 going to be like who the hell is jack
01:54 parsons and that sure sounds a lot like
01:56 jet propulsion laboratory
01:59 same thing what i'm going to do and you
02:02 know part of it was for me to find
02:05 more information about jpl and really
02:08 establish the historical link
02:11 to nasa and the moon missions via
02:14 missile programs and that's done you're
02:17 going to get that info in this episode
02:20 what's fascinating about this whole
02:21 thing is that the whole vision
02:24 of this really starts with a guy named
02:27 jack parsons
02:28 at least his mother called him jack and
02:30 we're gonna we're gonna get into this
02:32 if you go to jpl's webpage
02:35 or nasa.gov and you look up the history
02:37 of jpl
02:39 they've erased jack from history
02:42 as a matter of fact there's only one
02:43 group photograph of some
02:46 graduate students from caltech in any
02:48 one of the shots and they have a guy in
02:50 the bottom right corner it looks a lot
02:51 like
02:51 jack but they're calling him john
02:53 persons
02:55 so i don't want to take anything away
02:57 from a gentleman named john parsons
02:59 pretty coincidental the guy looks just
03:01 like jack
03:02 but they erase this guy out of history
03:05 and i think for fairly legitimate
03:07 reasons and he's not a
03:09 inter he's not like a tesla
03:12 in terms of a an entire
03:16 lifespan of giving
03:19 to society and patenting you know
03:21 hundreds and hundreds of things that's
03:23 tesla
03:24 i couldn't find a single patent for jack
03:27 so i'm thinking most of his history
03:30 which i'm going to share with you
03:32 which is going to link to aleister
03:34 crowley which is going to link
03:36 a little bit to l ron hubbard and then
03:38 we're going to get into jpl's history
03:40 so first you get the background it's
03:44 always important to know where something
03:45 comes from right
03:47 we have organizations like the kkk in
03:50 america and everyone has been told
03:52 it's been a party to the wrong party
03:56 the party that invented it is the party
03:58 that's trying to pretend to care about
04:00 black people today and i'm going to
04:03 politicize this intro
04:04 but that's the truth when you go look at
04:06 who founded the party of the kkk
04:09 who has been grand master wizards all
04:12 the way up until the 70s
04:14 it's the democrats but most people don't
04:17 know that
04:17 so this story is very similar in species
04:21 that oh my gosh this was the way this
04:23 company started
04:25 now whether or not that actually has a
04:27 link to the inner bounds
04:30 i think they did a pretty good job
04:32 cleaning
04:33 jack away from their history just go
04:36 look at their website
04:37 and moving forward with something that
04:41 wasn't going to be
04:44 uh how do i put this they didn't they
04:47 couldn't allow someone who was messing
04:49 around with their life and out of
04:50 control to be involved with what was
04:52 going to be
04:53 probably one of the biggest money
04:54 laundering organizations on planet earth
04:58 not money laundering necessarily into
05:00 anyone's personal pockets but you know
05:02 people
05:03 create companies to build parts and that
05:05 kind of stuff
05:06 but more laundering into a defense
05:08 program as opposed to the
05:12 customer facing space programs
05:15 so let's begin so 1914
05:20 now just roll that back in your head
05:22 1914 man
05:23 i had one grandparent that was born in
05:25 1910 and one that was born in 1912.
05:28 the gentleman was named originally
05:30 marvel
05:32 whitesides parson and
05:36 his mother coined the phrase jack so
05:39 that's kind of cool usually that kind of
05:40 thing doesn't happen man
05:43 so this kid grows up in the heyday of
05:46 fictional science fiction
05:49 uh television programming like buck
05:51 rogers
05:53 you know rocket man that kind of stuff
05:55 so they're seeing
05:56 and h.g wells books that are essentially
05:59 saying look
06:00 human beings are going to go everywhere
06:03 that we can go
06:05 now of course the wright brothers they
06:07 do their first flight they photograph it
06:09 they take it in for a patent
06:10 they're denied and three years later
06:12 they do it in france
06:14 then america decides to patent it so
06:17 everything's going in that direction
06:18 here's jack who has a dream as a little
06:21 kid
06:22 to fly into space and why so
06:27 because every time he turns on a radio
06:29 this is what he's hearing and the second
06:31 he turns on
06:32 i don't know when he had access to a
06:33 television but jack grew up in a very
06:36 rich
06:37 family and he lived on orange grove road
06:40 in pasadena and this is the road just so
06:44 you guys know that the back to the
06:45 future building or back to the future
06:47 houses on
06:48 which i think is the campbell house
06:50 which i've been in which is a crazy
06:53 um arts and crafts home
06:57 i've mentioned several things about that
06:59 house to you guys whether identified or
07:00 not
07:01 in the episodes it's a gorgeous road
07:05 in pasadena it's called orange grove if
07:08 you want to see a really cool classy
07:09 place
07:11 just get on google maps and take a look
07:14 and you'll see that back to the future
07:15 house fact
07:16 if you didn't look up where back to the
07:17 future house was and you're a fan of
07:18 that movie
07:20 just drive around until you think you
07:21 see it it's towards the hillside
07:24 so orange grove is where the rose bowl
07:27 happens
07:28 that's where they stage a lot of the
07:29 floats
07:31 and then it goes down this hill and very
07:33 up and then that's where bud sid lived
07:36 so jack was described as a uh
07:41 and you can see lots of photographs of
07:42 him he transformed quite a bit over time
07:45 when he was a young lady a little bit of
07:47 weight on him
07:48 his father passed away and so he
07:53 didn't have that guidance and so his
07:56 grandfather was a big part after his
07:58 father passed away
08:00 and so you know he was a little feminine
08:02 didn't have that guidance
08:05 but then he uh he got through it trust
08:08 me
08:10 but there's a couple things he wanted to
08:12 go and figure out
08:15 how to get into space the problem is
08:19 is he's sitting there with nothing
08:23 so the the interesting thing about
08:26 jack was that rockets were something
08:30 that were theorized because we had
08:31 fireworks and of course the chinese did
08:33 their
08:34 you know gunpowder thing and so we all
08:36 knew about these things we had
08:38 all kinds of explosives that we knew
08:40 move things here in an atmospheric world
08:43 and so he gravitated to what a lot of
08:46 teenagers do and
08:47 man this is definitely my my younger
08:50 years
08:51 which is getting gun power getting
08:54 maybe some fireworks unraveling them and
08:56 then building them into something that
08:57 you want
08:59 and blowing them up in your backyard and
09:01 just kind of getting a sense of how
09:04 explosives work now it
09:08 helped me out that my second cousin
09:10 larry
09:11 who i did an episode on was a master
09:13 chemist and a genius and he was mixing
09:15 things like nitroglycerin in his
09:17 basement
09:18 and he taught my dad some stuff my dad
09:19 became an explosives expert in the oil
09:21 business at one point
09:23 and so there's a lot of influence a lot
09:25 of uh knowledge
09:26 scientific knowledge be careful with
09:28 this you're going to blow your hand off
09:29 with that so we managed not to do any
09:31 that and so did jack
09:33 but you know how when you put something
09:35 on top of a firework and you blow it up
09:37 and it flies into the air apparently
09:40 this is where
09:42 jack started to figure out oh my gosh
09:44 you know propulsion
09:45 thrust force again needs an atmosphere
09:47 to really work well
09:50 i was an idiot and uh dipped to my cigar
09:52 i thought my
09:53 ashtray was empty and it's full of water
09:55 so i kind of doused my cigar here
09:58 with water you've done that to a
10:02 cigarette you'll know what i'm dealing
10:03 with right now
10:05 so he gets into school and what he wants
10:07 to do is
10:09 learn about chemistry learn about
10:11 explosives
10:12 chemical effects and so this is the
10:16 route he goes
10:18 at the same time he's intelligent
10:22 he's a bit of an outcast because again
10:25 at the
10:25 you know that formative years when
10:27 you're a little geeky you typically have
10:29 a lot of your buddies
10:31 and then but you want
10:34 probably the opposite sex to be involved
10:36 with your life if that's the way you
10:37 like to do things and he's going to get
10:41 his chance trust me
10:42 so he and his buddies start developing
10:47 rockets but it takes a couple things to
10:49 happen for this to really take effect
10:52 he wasn't tremendously good in school
10:56 and you know a lot of us aren't terribly
10:59 great in school like i got
11:00 straight a's in the classes that i love
11:01 but i got f pluses in a lot of other
11:04 classes
11:05 at least up until seventh grade and then
11:08 uh
11:09 yeah i think i ate a couple f's in high
11:10 school because there was a
11:12 thing going on with my personal life
11:16 but physics did really well i got i got
11:18 a passing grade in physics without
11:20 taking a single test
11:21 because my teacher was like i know you
11:23 know all the crap why the hell i'm
11:24 trying to come in doing the tests i'm
11:25 like
11:26 i'm sorry but he's migrated into what's
11:28 called the brown military academy
11:32 and he ends up blowing up a toilet and
11:34 getting expelled
11:36 which is interesting but the problem was
11:39 is that with his father out of the game
11:41 his mother had to lean on her father to
11:43 pay the bills but his father died in
11:44 1931
11:47 and so at this point
11:50 pasadena and caltech was a pretty small
11:54 little institution
11:56 and apparently he starts attending a
11:58 college
12:00 that where he's able to actually study
12:02 chemistry
12:03 in the vein of explosives and
12:07 anything related to the physics of
12:09 flying
12:11 and of course at this point the
12:14 the physics of rocketry was next to
12:17 non-existent i mean imagine you're
12:19 sitting there saying
12:20 you know i'll give you an example this
12:22 would be like you and i trying to to
12:23 invent a time machine
12:26 well no one's ever done it that we know
12:28 of and so all we have
12:30 is a theoretical understanding of time
12:32 travel
12:33 and you have to believe time exists and
12:35 it's actually recorded in the fabric of
12:37 the universe because the information
12:38 isn't stored
12:40 in the fabric of the universe such that
12:42 you can physically move from point a to
12:44 point b
12:44 through time there's no place for you to
12:47 go because the state of the universe at
12:49 that moment doesn't exist anymore
12:52 all you have is a memory of it in your
12:54 head
12:55 but he gets a compa he gets a job at a
12:57 company called a
12:58 hercules powder company which was a
13:01 local
13:02 gunpowder company he ends up marrying a
13:06 a woman by the name of northrop in uh
13:11 1935. well then he gets introduced to a
13:14 graduate student from caltech by the
13:16 name of frank
13:17 molina and
13:20 when he gets that introduction he gets
13:23 closer to what's going to be
13:26 jpl together they formed a group called
13:31 the
13:32 galcit research center
13:36 and we're going to loop back into that
13:37 as well but we're kind of trying to stay
13:38 on jack at this point
13:41 but they had a shortened little name for
13:42 themselves they call themselves the
13:43 suicide squad
13:46 because obviously what they're doing is
13:47 extremely dangerous
13:50 they create something called the jado
13:53 rocket
13:55 and this looks like from the videos that
13:58 i saw
13:59 and i hope no one used the wrong videos
14:01 but looks like a v1 buzz
14:03 buzz bum which again i'll put that on
14:06 the screen
14:07 it looks like a plane with a rocket
14:09 engine in it
14:10 and mainly you'll find out later in the
14:12 episode that that was really crafted
14:14 just as a
14:16 takeoff assistant and you can imagine
14:19 you know the military's fairly primitive
14:22 the air force is definitely very
14:23 primitive
14:25 and it's about to get much more advanced
14:28 during world war ii
14:30 but now imagine you've got a squadron of
14:32 pilots
14:34 sitting in a hangar and some emergencies
14:36 taking place
14:37 and now you want to get everyone at the
14:39 highest altitude as quickly as possible
14:41 that's what the jado is all about and
14:43 once the military saw the jado
14:45 get assisted by this they were in to win
14:47 it man
14:49 so jack is very successful assisting in
14:52 this because he just
14:53 has a whole life of building rocketry
14:56 it's his dream i'm i'm sure that if you
14:59 ever spoke to the man
15:01 he could take you through the lineage of
15:02 the entire project and that's usually
15:05 with the kind of people you want on it
15:06 so he starts making bank
15:08 he starts getting paid tremendous
15:10 amounts of money per week
15:13 so he buys this nice little crib and he
15:16 calls it the parsonage
15:18 house this is where stuff takes off
15:21 and it's a very interesting thing you
15:23 know i've always told you guys and you
15:25 all know it any of you who aren't still
15:28 living with your parents you know that
15:29 first place that you get by yourself
15:32 it's a it's a rite of passage it's
15:34 amazing you
15:35 you revel in the fact that you can do
15:37 anything that you want to do
15:40 and this is what happened to him and boy
15:42 did he uh
15:44 get get going here the only problem was
15:48 he meets a guy named alistair crawley
15:51 who was worshiping a form of
15:56 you can't really call it satanism at all
15:59 at all
16:00 i have heard that associated with him
16:02 the satanism
16:03 that was attempted was actually by jack
16:06 parsons by himself
16:08 when he was a little kid and he wanted
16:11 to
16:12 learn how to do rocketry so much and
16:15 again he ran up against the barrier that
16:17 nobody knows anything about this
16:20 and so he ends up trying to summon the
16:22 devil in his bedroom
16:25 and he admitted nothing happened
16:26 whatsoever
16:28 but he did the jack torrance thing
16:31 and said he would sell his soul to get
16:34 a rocketry get into rocketry and getting
16:36 it going
16:37 yeah aleister crowley
16:40 although you know he's a writer
16:44 he's a very brilliant guy he
16:48 was study something called uh thalima
16:53 and technically it should be said filima
16:57 but this was a very interesting thing
16:59 and i just mentioned for you people that
17:01 remember every word i say
17:02 god bless you i do apologize
17:07 the orgasm is a wild emotion isn't it
17:11 when it's going on if you are terribly
17:14 lucid during that experience you know
17:16 that there's no other emotional
17:17 state that the body gets into besides a
17:20 massive fight or flight situation or
17:23 perhaps
17:24 you know you're winning a lottery or
17:27 something beautiful happens like having
17:29 a child and you're there when the child
17:30 comes out of your wife
17:32 it's it's huge and these moments have
17:34 something but the there's something
17:36 that's very special and super
17:38 accelerated
17:40 with an orgasm because let's just say
17:42 you're having the most amazing
17:43 experience you won the lottery you got a
17:44 new baby
17:46 and let's say the new baby one that's a
17:48 good one if you've had kids
17:49 you'll hopefully have had this
17:51 experience but you'll have like you know
17:53 you're
17:53 on cloud nine for several hours if not
17:56 days
17:57 now you know an orgasm is that smashed
17:59 into a
18:00 10 seconds you know and so what
18:04 felima was chartered to do
18:08 was that aleister crowley had the idea
18:12 that during that moment of orgasm
18:15 you are so one with the universe that
18:18 the law of attraction
18:21 is is at your beck and call
18:24 you send out into the universe
18:27 what you want to have happen right
18:29 during that moment
18:30 seems like a really disturbing uh
18:34 thing to do during such a wonderful
18:35 moment now i will tell you the paul
18:37 harvey to this story
18:39 before you run off and go oh my god that
18:41 sounds like such a great idea i will do
18:42 that tonight
18:44 neither one of these guys necessarily
18:47 had a good life after that they they
18:50 really didn't experience
18:51 and now i will say aleister got a second
18:54 start
18:54 but it was only after he completely and
18:56 utterly rejected
18:58 felima worship jack did not
19:01 experience this although some people
19:04 would say well he wanted to
19:06 people in space he wanted rockets and so
19:08 all these things have supposedly
19:10 occurred so
19:11 maybe using this technique he was able
19:13 to be one with the universe and pull
19:15 this in
19:15 i want to stress that in my researches
19:19 of jack specifically and even aleister
19:23 crowley we know that alistair
19:25 dressed with like illuminati hats and
19:27 did some funny things
19:28 the only thing i know about alistair
19:30 which i'm not going to go into any
19:32 detail
19:32 is that his mentor was an older woman
19:35 who was born deep in the 1800s and he
19:39 got mentored by some eugenicists
19:44 or is it eugenics people eugenesis
19:46 eugenics
19:50 but you have to remember jack has no
19:52 father
19:54 no father figure so here's a guy that
19:56 kind of has his stuff dialed in
19:58 who had a dad aleister crowley as far as
20:01 i know
20:02 so when the parsonage house came into
20:05 effect
20:06 and he marries his wife this northrop
20:09 girl
20:11 he starts getting into this thing and so
20:12 what they end up doing in order to have
20:15 as many orgasms as possible
20:17 to control the universe is to have
20:18 orgies all
20:20 day long now typically how you
20:23 have it read from aleister cauley's side
20:26 is that he was a very
20:27 prolific person in all identifiable
20:31 cults occults so i'm sure he was very
20:35 informed about
20:37 things that he inherited from history
20:40 and then of course he made up some of
20:42 his own stuff as well
20:44 their their mission statement for thema
20:48 is the only real dna crossover with
20:52 satanism
20:53 which is do without wilt
20:57 which is do exactly what you want the
20:59 entire time
21:00 if you listen to um anton levay
21:04 that's the dude when his kids were
21:06 interviewed in the
21:08 late 70s early 80s they had the same
21:11 thing they you know they said
21:13 you should always do what you want screw
21:15 everybody else
21:17 and they their big their big case study
21:20 for satanism was well the animals don't
21:23 help each other in the
21:25 in the forest so why should we help each
21:26 other you just take what you want move
21:28 on
21:29 survival the fed is 24 7. and if you've
21:31 seen a little dog sit next to his buddy
21:33 and they're not even the same species of
21:35 dog
21:37 or i should say species but same type of
21:38 dog
21:40 you know that's not true they do help
21:43 each other
21:44 monkeys that cry over a monkey that died
21:47 in the village not even their
21:49 offspring that's bs right
21:52 it's just a convenient way to be a
21:54 [ __ ] right
21:56 yeah aleister crowley was also known for
21:58 calling himself the beast
22:00 and uh you know i don't know if that's a
22:02 god thing sounds like a
22:04 not god thing don't want to cast any
22:06 dispersions on him
22:09 but they would work out what they called
22:12 sex magic
22:13 so they wanted to not only hit this
22:15 orgasm but
22:16 hit it with a spell that would be spoken
22:19 at the same time and i don't know how
22:21 they did this i don't know if like
22:23 you know couple a is doing their thing
22:25 and as soon as they sense anyone
22:28 hitting this climax then dude
22:31 c starts reading off the spell but they
22:34 were trying to incantate you know
22:37 reality through this mechanism and i
22:39 think
22:41 both jack and alistair both
22:46 claimed that nothing happened nothing
22:48 miraculous ever happened you know it
22:49 wasn't like oh this is really working so
22:51 we're going to continue
22:52 i just like to have sex you know so
22:55 jack's house became the epicenter for
22:56 this
22:57 and then his wife leaves him but he's
23:00 okay
23:01 he starts sleeping with her sister and
23:04 she's way into this
23:05 okay can you imagine that you're
23:08 sleeping with my
23:09 ex-husband yeah and i love it you're an
23:12 idiot you know
23:14 it was said that alistair was super
23:16 duper addicted to sex
23:18 and then they started using
23:19 mind-altering drugs
23:22 because it obviously opened up their
23:24 senses they're having better orgasms or
23:26 whatever
23:26 they're really into what they're doing
23:28 they're seeing things that they hadn't
23:30 seen before
23:31 because you know all i can imagine was
23:35 dudes back in those days were pretty
23:36 stoic people
23:39 very monotone but they're very kind and
23:42 so imagine taking a psychotropic drug
23:44 when you could barely conceive of what a
23:46 trip might be
23:48 as a u.s citizen but heroin got in there
23:52 and starts messing everything up
23:55 in shows up l ron hubbard founder of
23:58 scientology
24:00 he's a sci-fi writer he's really rich
24:02 and he's
24:03 smart he had kind of concocted something
24:06 called the
24:07 the babylon working which used what they
24:10 call scarlet women
24:12 to then give birth to moon children
24:15 i think you have to really ascend to tom
24:17 cruise's level before that'll make a lot
24:18 of sense
24:20 but now here's jack he's doing really
24:23 well
24:24 at his job he's doing all this crazy
24:26 stuff on the outside he's hanging out
24:27 with a strange group of people
24:30 this is the time where elrond hubbard
24:34 was
24:35 was quoted as saying that he was going
24:36 to
24:38 start his own religion jack gets fired
24:43 jack gets fired from jpl and this is
24:46 when they start to
24:48 scrub him from the history and he was
24:51 just sort of an ancillary guy because
24:53 they hadn't really formalized
24:55 this new company that's going to be
24:57 showing up until around this time so
24:59 once they realize man it's going to be
25:00 really important
25:02 this is going to be super important
25:05 you know defense related things and
25:07 we're going to go back
25:08 rewind back to this point here in a few
25:10 minutes and we'll get back to jpl's
25:13 sort of official history and then we're
25:14 gonna analyze it
25:16 you can't have a guy sleeping with
25:18 people taking drugs
25:20 you might know something very special
25:22 about the technology and someone will
25:24 simply
25:24 blackmail you with your escapades and
25:28 you can you imagine having exposed
25:30 photographs
25:31 in the mid-30s having orgies and and
25:34 doing this to lima stuff
25:35 and hanging out with aleister crowley
25:37 who calls himself the beast and i mean
25:39 you know it could get really messy
25:40 really quick because people back
25:42 in those days would show up at your
25:43 house and lynch you quite literally
25:46 for blasphemous behavior so then
25:49 in a twist of fate elrond hubbard
25:53 comes to jack parsons who's still loaded
25:56 man
25:57 for whatever reason he had been low on
26:00 money and he wanted to start a company
26:02 to facilitate boating
26:06 he borrows twenty thousand dollars from
26:07 jack and steals his girlfriend
26:11 his ex-wife's sister who was in love
26:14 with
26:14 elwyn hubbard and had his kids this was
26:17 a photograph of
26:18 the two together with several kids in
26:21 front of him
26:22 he never pays back jack parsons because
26:25 he has high integrity jack finally took
26:28 him to court and got his money
26:30 he starts dating a new woman by the name
26:32 of marjorie
26:33 cameron they marry in 1945
26:38 and marjorie had taken
26:41 so many psychotropic drugs
26:44 and had so many experiences within this
26:48 little cult
26:49 that she started seeing sort of into the
26:51 world premonitions which
26:53 i think in 2021 we can pretty much say
26:56 did not occur
26:58 so his new wife
27:02 puts him to shame in terms of extremism
27:04 right
27:06 now the basis of his firing was very
27:07 interesting
27:09 because he had applied for a job in
27:11 israel to help them
27:15 develop rockets and of course he's just
27:17 not even thinking straight he's not
27:18 thinking about security clearances and
27:20 what have you
27:22 it would it may not have been so
27:25 apparent
27:25 like in our day and age we know that um
27:28 there's something called national
27:29 security and if you knew something
27:31 special you wouldn't dare walk to
27:34 even an ally without checking you
27:36 through the state department the dod
27:37 i mean you'd have to be very careful
27:39 that kind of he just like hey what's
27:40 going on right
27:42 so before long he's married to his new
27:45 wife for about six years and they
27:46 divorce
27:47 1951
27:50 and he can't get a job anywhere in
27:53 defense
27:54 anywhere in aerospace he can't they just
27:57 he's a liability
27:59 so he goes off and becomes a technician
28:02 a pyro technician for movies but the
28:05 work was pretty
28:06 pretty sparse you know even worked at a
28:09 gas station at one point so here he is
28:11 completely broke because he doesn't have
28:14 any more income
28:15 he's got lots of bills he started
28:17 renting rooms out of his house to pay
28:18 the bills
28:20 but he gets one last job on this movie
28:23 set
28:24 and apparently he didn't have a lot of
28:25 time for him to do it and he's just like
28:28 you know
28:29 i'm okay just go away i'll get this all
28:31 worked out
28:33 and one of the final words that anyone
28:35 ever said to him was well don't blow
28:36 yourself up
28:39 sure enough later that day a massive
28:41 explosion
28:43 happens and he turns into gus from
28:48 breaking bad half of his face is
28:52 pretty much destroyed dies pretty
28:55 shortly after the accident
28:57 now there are several folks that make a
29:00 pretty compelling case that
29:01 he was probably set up to die
29:06 need to get rid of this guy because he
29:08 does know too much if he's not going to
29:09 be controllable
29:11 and so maybe that someone put some stuff
29:15 together
29:15 such that a and b were reversed or
29:18 whatever
29:19 he was only 37 years old now people
29:22 who might suspect that oh no he probably
29:25 killed himself because look at look at
29:26 his life
29:27 two wives well actually two wives and a
29:29 girlfriend
29:30 girlfriend gets stolen from him loses
29:32 his job gets black bald
29:34 he's having trouble making his work
29:36 together or you know getting his money
29:37 together
29:39 the thing about this is if he was truly
29:42 trying to blow himself up
29:43 he was an expert he would have built
29:47 you know a pipe bomb the size of a
29:49 telephone pole and probably just done
29:51 himself in instantaneously without any
29:52 pain
29:53 but instead he suffered
29:56 massive burns massive injuries and so
29:59 i think it's fairly compelling that he
30:01 perhaps
30:05 just died by either an accident or
30:06 getting assassinated
30:08 the only homage to jack parsons that
30:11 nasa ever did
30:13 was to name a crater on the dark side of
30:15 the moon
30:16 after jack just sort of
30:20 you know put a scarlet letter on his
30:23 legacy
30:24 for those of you that don't know uh
30:28 president lincoln was put on a penny and
30:30 his face is turned the other way
30:32 from the other coins that all have
30:34 silverish tones
30:36 nickels and silver to basically say that
30:39 he turned his back on the banks
30:42 harriet tudman being put on the 20 in my
30:45 opinion
30:46 is not about honoring her it's about
30:49 getting
30:50 jackson off the 20. because jackson also
30:53 beat the banks
30:55 how he lasted on the 20 as long as he
30:57 has
30:59 uh is a miracle in my opinion
31:03 so now let's go into jpl's official
31:06 history of themselves and let's review
31:09 but a dude named theodore von carmen
31:12 a caltech professor was the
31:15 person that's historically credited with
31:18 creating that
31:19 that squad that is the
31:22 squad that we famously know as the
31:24 suicide squad
31:26 wasn't jack it was this guy
31:29 the operations were centered in aurora
31:31 seca
31:32 seco which is a little dry canyon marsh
31:36 north of the rose bowl in pasadena
31:39 and again a lot of this area has been
31:41 inhabited now
31:42 built up and so these areas may or may
31:45 not still exist to this day
31:47 but in the original squad that's
31:50 photographed is a guy named uh
31:52 rudolph schott apollo
31:55 m.o smith franklin molina that's the guy
31:58 we
31:58 know from his history edward foreman and
32:01 john parsons
32:04 now john was not a part of his original
32:05 name his name was jack
32:07 as for his mother so if you look at the
32:10 photograph
32:11 it looks like jack but it must be a guy
32:14 named john
32:15 now as i start touring the jpl official
32:18 history
32:20 i want you guys to keep in mind my
32:22 episode regarding
32:24 the moon missions and how i
32:28 told you that this was all a missile
32:31 program
32:32 that was later veneered with a space
32:35 program
32:37 and there's going to be a turning point
32:38 in the story where i think that
32:40 transition occurred
32:41 and i think it was purely financial but
32:44 you'll start to see it coming most
32:45 likely
32:46 so december 31st 1936
32:50 well within jack parsons participation
32:55 an alcohol fueled rocket
32:58 was attached to this vehicle and we get
33:00 the jada launch
33:01 this set the whole thing into motion
33:05 by 1943 i mean this is their official
33:08 stuff man
33:09 they asked this von cartman guy to do a
33:11 full analysis of the v2 rocket
33:15 remember what i told you the nasa
33:17 doesn't exist just yet
33:20 remember what i told you once the allies
33:23 saw buzz
33:24 bombs coming in by the hundreds and
33:26 hitting indiscriminate targets in
33:28 england
33:28 and then the v2 getting all the way to
33:31 london they were jealous they wanted
33:35 that power
33:37 but now the charter that then
33:40 moved into place was to develop a rival
33:42 for the v2
33:44 okay well the v2 is going 70 miles
33:47 100 miles and when you talk about
33:52 beating that rocket then you're talking
33:54 about probably
33:55 i don't know getting it across the ocean
33:58 from the atlantic ocean the smallest one
34:00 intercontinental ballistic ideas before
34:02 you ever use that acronym
34:05 so by 1943 the organization
34:08 is named jet propulsion laboratories
34:14 now one documentary i saw acknowledged
34:16 that it was actually called jack parsons
34:18 laboratory
34:19 and then they switched it over to
34:22 jeffree pulse's laboratory
34:24 it's a great acronym swap let me tell
34:27 you
34:28 now 1944 they've had a chance to observe
34:32 the v2
34:34 again american troops aren't on the
34:35 ground any significant
34:37 since in in europe until those
34:40 d-day invasions right so we just show up
34:43 out of thin air and start doing what we
34:44 do
34:45 c saving private ryan for details
34:48 the same year in the leech spring
34:52 which is the mojave desert they start
34:54 shooting unguided missiles
34:56 just to see how far they can get them
34:58 into the air
34:59 and you know because then you need to
35:01 learn
35:03 essentially what you have to develop in
35:05 addition to an unguided system
35:07 apparently they were able to fire a
35:08 missile like 11 miles
35:10 which still way below the v2 isn't it
35:15 by 1945 this little company had swelled
35:19 to 300
35:20 engineers and i want to stress
35:24 that regardless of any criticism we have
35:27 of these organizations and i say this
35:28 every once in a while
35:30 these organizations do employ the most
35:32 brilliant people on planet earth in
35:34 these respective sciences
35:36 but they also just happen to employ
35:39 some of the most brilliant people when
35:41 it comes to
35:42 the layers of i guess you call it maybe
35:45 like 4d
35:46 chests that would be able to
35:49 veneer its history smuggle money from
35:51 one project to another
35:53 so they're also that brilliant and i'm
35:56 sure that their perspective on this
35:58 whole thing is like
35:59 well look what the germans were just
36:00 capable of doing if the russians can
36:02 figure it out before us
36:05 they can come after us put them on a
36:07 some sort of submarine u-boat thing
36:10 we're gonna be in big trouble if we
36:12 don't do this it's almost like that
36:14 situation in most movies where you're
36:15 gonna bully beating up the kids
36:18 with something and let's say he had a
36:19 little weapon that just made him
36:21 extra powerful you're gonna have to beat
36:23 him with some other weapon and
36:24 you wouldn't normally waste your time in
36:27 your life with such efforts
36:29 but this guy exists that's the problem
36:33 before 1945 is over
36:36 in white sands new mexico they're able
36:38 to fire a missile
36:40 40 miles in the air that's a hell of
36:43 accomplishment
36:45 for 1945. i don't know exactly how high
36:50 the
36:50 v2 flew but it never looked like it went
36:54 that far in the air at all doesn't
36:56 really have to you know tomahawk
36:57 missiles comb the earth it's tremendous
36:59 right
37:01 but they want to get it to
37:04 another country from the united states
37:07 over both of our oceans
37:09 because you know at that point the
37:10 japanese are also
37:13 you know a formidable opponent even
37:15 though they were conquered
37:16 every soldier ever fought one you know
37:18 the japanese
37:20 they they come to play man they show up
37:24 they earn their paycheck right well
37:27 the whole notion just in case this isn't
37:30 apparent to you
37:32 is that atmosphere thickness is what
37:35 causes the drag
37:36 on a shape and they know that if
37:41 they knew that by planes you know we had
37:43 biplanes
37:45 but by flying planes all the way through
37:47 the war
37:49 they realize that the oxygen gets
37:51 thinner and thinner when you go up and
37:52 it affects
37:53 everything it affects aerodynamics they
37:55 had to put you know masks on after a
37:57 while because
37:59 there's not enough oxygen to breathe and
38:01 here you are trying to dog fight and
38:03 you're hyperventilating
38:04 imagine that and so they would also wear
38:06 all those
38:07 those flight jackets because it's super
38:09 freezing up there
38:10 now you always have an engine that
38:12 usually can route its exhaust
38:14 um not it's not the actual fuel exhaust
38:17 but the
38:18 thermal exhaust off the engine to create
38:20 a heater wherever you are
38:21 so there's always that typically
38:25 they've always said in world war ii all
38:28 the way up till
38:29 modern day times where you had humvees
38:32 the one thing that was comforting about
38:33 the old jeeps is
38:34 they had heaters and i think the very
38:37 first
38:38 design if i'm correct they hadn't built
38:40 the firewall
38:42 to be perforated and so soldiers were
38:44 freezing but then when they realized hey
38:46 man this engine's making tons of heat
38:47 that we have to disperse let's just rot
38:49 it directly into the cabin
38:51 area even if it doesn't have a top your
38:53 hands and feet could be nice and warm
38:55 which also keeps you excited as an
38:57 individual vibration wise
38:59 you can fight a war well because
39:00 hypothermia is when your body slows down
39:03 so much
39:04 you can't even move messages around your
39:07 body
39:08 let alone your brain so as they start
39:11 launching these vehicles they realize
39:13 they need a lot of controls on them
39:14 right
39:16 my knowledge of the v2 is that the
39:18 germans were using timers
39:20 and gyroscopes to figure out when to
39:22 tilt the v2s down
39:24 for their eventual approach for their
39:26 target but that's just like a swiss
39:28 watch doing its thing
39:31 what the military figured out was they
39:33 need to have radio controlled systems
39:37 so the first two two-way radio that was
39:40 hooked up between a rocket to then
39:42 affect its navigation
39:43 it was in 1947. and this rocket was
39:46 called the corporal
39:48 now there's a lot of logistics with
39:51 trying to get senate approvals for
39:53 things
39:54 and this is where we start getting into
39:57 a frictional relationship between these
40:00 agencies and the politicians that
40:02 control the money
40:04 so throughout 1957 and 58
40:09 what this rocket team was trying to do
40:11 was to figure out how small can you make
40:13 a nuclear bomb and then
40:17 based on its weight and its size which
40:19 was um
40:21 best way to describe it i'll put a
40:24 picture of eisenhower with this thing
40:26 supposedly this picture of eisenhower
40:27 with this warhead was that the warhead
40:29 had actually already flown up
40:30 and was recovered now whether or not
40:33 that's true who knows
40:35 but it's about three feet high two and a
40:37 half three feet high
40:38 and probably has a base of about two
40:40 feet it looks
40:41 just like the one in austin powers i
40:43 swear to god it's just a little bullet
40:45 cap
40:47 the rocket that did this big journey
40:51 was january 31st 1958
40:55 it was called the explorer one it was a
40:58 raving success
41:01 consequently this is when
41:04 a the geiger counter was developed by
41:07 none other than james von allen
41:10 who discovered the van allen belts which
41:13 i wanted to read to you
41:14 their quote their quote was that um
41:18 which discovered belts of trapped
41:20 radiation
41:22 encircling earth when is radiation ever
41:26 good
41:27 you know so by the end of the same year
41:30 remember this is january 31st
41:31 explorer one does its little mission
41:34 gives eisenhower a little
41:35 pr thing and here they are trying to
41:37 fight a pr
41:39 war with congress and the public he puts
41:42 this missile
41:43 head on display and is like look
41:45 everybody look aren't you
41:47 excited about nuclear bombs now remember
41:50 in the 1950s it was all about duck and
41:52 cover
41:53 and i just want to repeat you know i've
41:55 got a buddy of mine who's 77 years old
41:58 he lived next to testing sites because
42:00 his father was a
42:01 test pilot back in the day and he would
42:06 look on television i guess they would do
42:08 countdowns on tv of when these bombs are
42:10 going to be
42:11 exploded then he'd run to the front of
42:13 the house
42:14 and he'd see these giant plumes over the
42:17 hill
42:18 and he'd run to his room screaming and
42:21 crying
42:22 it was a big deal so by december 3rd of
42:26 the same year 1958
42:29 the gpl laboratories are turned into
42:33 what they call a civil space agency
42:37 so not they can do government contracts
42:39 if they want
42:40 but they're not supposed to be on the
42:42 dime
42:44 of the american people but gpl by this
42:48 time had occupied 177 acres
42:51 it's big and i want to describe for you
42:53 guys
42:54 one day i was visiting my buddy sid with
42:56 my family
42:58 and i left probably christmas
43:01 christmas party or something like that
43:02 new year's party whatever it was broad
43:04 daylight it's really nice
43:05 and trying to get down i went a weird
43:07 way to get to the highway
43:09 and ended up thinking i was turning into
43:11 an exit to get on the highway and i
43:13 turned into the jpl gates
43:16 and this place is locked so tight i ca i
43:19 went right up it's like a military you
43:21 know
43:22 front and dude's kind of going and they
43:23 know people do this and so it's just one
43:25 of those little things where i did a
43:26 u-turn
43:27 but man it was the first time it really
43:29 dawned on me how protected this
43:30 institution is
43:32 and it makes sense so now think about
43:34 this they don't put this in their
43:36 history because they don't really wanna
43:37 i think a fine
43:39 point on this history maybe i'm reading
43:42 too much into it but you decide
43:44 what happens during kennedy's
43:46 administration
43:49 he announces this mission to get to the
43:52 moon
43:54 to send a man there safely and return
43:58 or send a man there and return safely i
44:00 mean
44:02 you know this is why it should just seem
44:04 insane that we went there in 69 with the
44:06 technology that we had
44:08 to look at all the scientific facts of
44:10 what we were capable of doing and not
44:12 capable of doing
44:15 i'm not sure if the whole world unless
44:17 of course we have what we believe to be
44:19 a bunch of hidden technologies
44:21 without all that shrouded technologies
44:24 and finding anti-gravity and bunch of
44:25 other stuff
44:27 which i think is just theoretical
44:28 because the power sources weren't really
44:30 there to
44:31 create that in a totally flyable vehicle
44:34 without
44:34 perhaps barfing radiation on everybody
44:37 which there's a few ufo sightings that
44:40 might be the result of such things
44:43 they needed a blanket situation that was
44:46 going to create
44:47 a rationale for spending billions and
44:50 billions of dollars
44:51 again i think the first missions to the
44:54 moon up until 72
44:56 consume 9.5 billion dollars which i
44:59 assume is a price tag from
45:01 kennedy's announcement to the point
45:03 where they ended the program with apollo
45:05 17.
45:07 remember too that the 50s also had
45:10 tremendous amounts of
45:13 science fiction themed television shows
45:15 radio shows we had
45:17 2000 plus as a radio show in the mid 50s
45:19 then we had x minus one
45:21 in the late 50s then we had twilight
45:23 zone which had tons of that stuff
45:25 we got sci-fi writers like asimov and
45:27 and philip k
45:28 dick and hinland and all these geniuses
45:31 writing stuff and there's just a billion
45:32 other writers that
45:34 will never know their names without
45:36 doing the research for all these little
45:38 sci-fi you know magazines that were
45:40 coming out every week in new york and la
45:43 what did we get in the 60s as well we
45:44 got star trek
45:46 just tons of stuff we made movies like
45:49 the
45:50 the earth stood still forbidden planet
45:52 all the b movies of ed wood
45:55 it was just a non-stop fest if you were
45:57 going to get into that genre they were
45:58 willing to greenlight you
46:00 and of course this went on and on
46:01 throughout the 70s with space 1999
46:04 star wars close encounters it goes on
46:07 and on
46:09 so jpl records in their history that by
46:11 1960 they had moved into robotics
46:15 with the full intent of putting one
46:18 unmanned landers
46:19 on other planets other celestial bodies
46:23 starting with the moon and of course
46:26 eventually some sort of roaming robot at
46:29 a future time
46:30 now i don't talk about these much uh
46:32 because they're sort of anticlimactic
46:34 but they're actually kind of interesting
46:35 when you go back and look at the
46:36 photographs that are supposedly came
46:38 back from these units
46:39 because it is something that you can
46:41 cross-reference with the props that they
46:43 made
46:43 of the moon to simulate the moon
46:46 missions and people getting out of a
46:48 a lunar lander with no excuse for
46:51 electricity
46:52 and no excuse for oxygen and all those
46:55 things that we mentioned
46:56 in the other episode but they have two
46:59 series of of orbital
47:02 reconnaissance satellites that were
47:06 called the rangers and they did
47:07 seven eight and nine launched from 1964
47:09 1965
47:11 and they just did pictures as much as
47:13 they could with a
47:14 control crash into the surface
47:17 which seems a little strange because we
47:19 have all these policies now
47:21 of keeping the foreign soil of another
47:25 planet fairly pristine
47:27 but apparently yes it's like whatever
47:30 and then you have the
47:31 surveyors one three five six and seven
47:35 they supposedly do these soft landings
47:38 go look it up it's very interesting
47:40 you'll see some really bizarre
47:42 soil types that were never
47:46 visible in any of the moon missions
47:50 i should tell you what's going on there
47:52 fairly insightful wouldn't you say
47:55 now the interesting thing about that
47:57 whole situation is that yeah
47:59 you definitely want some closer
48:00 photographs of the moon's surface just
48:02 in case what you're seeing through the
48:03 telescope
48:04 is somehow giving you the wrong
48:07 impression giving you the impression
48:09 this is super soft and
48:10 or super smooth i should say in the sea
48:12 of tranquility maybe you show up and
48:14 it's a bunch of
48:15 you know ice shards that are
48:19 20 feet tall and two feet apart and if
48:21 you land you're just going to get
48:22 stabbed like some pit and some
48:24 south american booby trap right
48:27 if you look at the efforts
48:31 in production of all of these
48:34 devices okay it's
48:38 it's sort of alluring to suggest that if
48:40 you know that the moon missions did not
48:42 occur
48:45 in their absolute truth you know we
48:47 launched the saturn v
48:48 that's amazing we never had a saturn v
48:52 explode i mean you realize that we
48:53 launched
48:54 geez like almost a dozen of those things
48:57 and never had a problem
48:59 i mean we launched at least eight of
49:00 them right because 10 went
49:02 to the moon and orbited i guess 10 used
49:05 the saturn v
49:06 i can't remember off in funny but now
49:09 the whole time that this
49:11 that this moon stuff's happening
49:15 that's all happening on the nasa ledger
49:18 the robotic flybys and all this other
49:21 stuff is happening on the gpo ledger
49:24 now you have the mariner series which
49:28 in the 70s by uh
49:31 i have it written down as 62 it must be
49:33 72 august 27th it's got to be 72.
49:37 this was the first time that they flew
49:39 something to venus
49:40 i'll correct it on the screen if it is
49:42 62. they send one to mars they send one
49:45 to
49:46 venus merider 9 is the first one to
49:49 actually get into orbit
49:50 around mars and mariner 10
49:54 is the first mission where they send a
49:57 rocket
49:58 supposedly to venus take a look and then
50:01 a very brief look and then use the
50:03 gravity of
50:05 venus to supposedly sling it over to
50:08 mercury
50:10 it hits venus in 1973
50:13 in november and then by february 74 it's
50:16 supposedly a mercury
50:18 by the mid 70s you get the viking
50:21 missions
50:22 which say they landed on mars
50:25 and then we have the uh
50:28 the voyager series i believe
50:32 both launched in 1977
50:35 and the the goal of these two voyagers
50:38 or veger as we like to call in my show
50:41 one was gonna slingshot around all of
50:43 the gas giants
50:45 and that goes first and then another one
50:49 hits uh jupiter and and saturn
50:52 now remember the technology was
50:57 developed by hollywood not a big deal
51:01 to create that prop in a million
51:04 different ways
51:05 you could pay artists to render a giant
51:08 painting of it and then you
51:10 take it way back take a photograph of it
51:12 you could
51:13 again computer cg the thing again peter
51:16 heims by 1984
51:18 which again dialed back two years for
51:23 the special effects being finished had
51:27 that done and completed by jpl for his
51:30 movie
51:30 2010 the sequel to kubrick 2001.
51:35 so they have it done and ready to go for
51:38 peter himes
51:39 well dial back about three years 1979
51:42 and you can start
51:43 showing the public these spheres in
51:46 space with these gas
51:48 loops around them right and of course
51:50 they've made a gigantic mistake with
51:53 the circular algorithm on the top of
51:55 saturn which
51:56 started as the algorithm compressed they
51:59 needed to refine the algorithm
52:01 the more that the radius started to
52:03 compress
52:05 and so one of the problems we had in
52:06 pain applications in the 80s and 90s
52:08 when
52:09 normal citizens like you and i tried to
52:11 code this you would write one algorithm
52:13 to generate a circle
52:14 and so you get the circle tool and the
52:16 paint app and you start drawing it but
52:17 the smaller you drew it
52:19 the more that it would in the first
52:21 versions of the product
52:23 start getting angular geometry
52:27 and so they had to refine it and then of
52:29 course eventually in the 90s we got
52:31 anti-aliasing
52:32 that we didn't have to do by hand and
52:34 everything got super duper smooth
52:37 by the early 80s the the agency's
52:40 administrator
52:41 of gpo had threatened to close gpl
52:46 entirely
52:48 i don't know if that was a play to the
52:49 congress or what have you but really
52:51 strange
52:52 what would make that happen well it
52:54 could be simply that
52:56 you don't fund us that we're just going
52:58 to shut this place down and you're going
52:59 to lose all that intellectual data
53:01 yeah we'll give you all the books
53:03 military or whatever but you won't be
53:05 able to figure it out because
53:07 you can't run our institution overnight
53:09 so you're going to be 10 years behind
53:11 the competition
53:12 you know meanwhile the space space
53:14 shuttle is going but that's over
53:16 in the nasa ledger doesn't mean they
53:19 don't share
53:20 technology between the two apparently
53:23 it is credited credited to jack parsons
53:27 the solid rocket fuel that was used in
53:30 the boosters of the space shuttle was a
53:32 direct invention of jack parsons
53:35 and again i tried to find patents you
53:37 know you go to
53:38 tesla's wikipedia
53:42 or other patent office things and
53:43 there's tons of patents for tesla
53:47 i searched on got probably 100 returns
53:50 out of
53:51 duckduckgo could not find anything with
53:54 jack parsons patents
53:56 so again i think he was could care less
53:59 about
53:59 something like that and again if he had
54:01 patents he probably would have made a
54:03 tremendous amount
54:04 of money moving into his future which
54:06 obviously didn't happen
54:08 now one of the little funny things i
54:09 discovered and i kind of
54:12 it kind of uh
54:15 just occurred to me recently and there's
54:18 there
54:19 this is sort of more of a joke than
54:21 reality but there is a point where
54:23 it is reality they build all these units
54:27 like rovers that are going to be on the
54:29 surface of mars
54:31 in these massive clean rooms now anytime
54:34 you have a component open
54:36 you most definitely don't want anything
54:38 inside there moisture
54:40 dirt whatever and you don't want to take
54:42 bacteria with you
54:44 because you don't want to be discovering
54:46 bacteria that we already have on earth
54:48 which was a big rumor that they started
54:52 that one of the rovers had picked up its
54:54 own bacteria
54:56 but it's kind of funny that these things
54:58 are in the most
55:01 tumultuous environment i use that word
55:03 too much you know
55:05 really rough environments with
55:07 sandstorms and all this other stuff
55:09 rust it's metal man it ain't dust and
55:12 dirt
55:13 it's metal supposedly iron dust
55:16 now the project history of jpl is
55:20 super duper dense there are
55:23 more projects in jpl unless you're
55:25 literally like a fanboy of jpl and you
55:27 simply know this stuff offhand
55:30 i was not aware of how many little teeny
55:32 tiny projects that they were involved in
55:35 a lot of the projects you will be aware
55:37 of but you weren't aware that they were
55:38 being handled by jpl
55:41 so again it looks as if at this point
55:45 because we're not flying the special
55:46 anymore nasa's domain
55:49 is primarily the space station the
55:51 international space station but that has
55:53 all kinds of other countries involved
55:55 you know spacex has taken over a
55:56 tremendous amount of that
55:58 endeavor of course spacex is trying to
56:02 get their
56:02 starship to launch and not explode
56:06 at this point i honestly think spacex is
56:08 just
56:10 just trolling the world you know with
56:12 the starship thing
56:14 you have this uh this facade and i won't
56:17 stick on this
56:18 for the rest of the episode anything but
56:19 you have this crazy giant bullet-shaped
56:22 buck rogers thing and just a few engines
56:26 down below
56:27 and they run a test and it seems like
56:30 they're trying to
56:32 i don't know test the form factor but if
56:35 you were successful with three engines i
56:37 i would i'm sure there's a reason that
56:38 someone could explain but it seems like
56:41 you wouldn't want to test a rocket
56:44 without its full arsenal
56:47 it's full composition it would be like
56:49 saying we're gonna make a car
56:51 and we're gonna put two tires on it
56:52 instead of four and once we figure out
56:55 how to balance on two
56:56 four will be a lot easier it's like you
56:57 know four is really easy right away
56:59 so what are you doing here or maybe one
57:01 tire directly in the center and everyone
57:02 has to sit in bounds so the thing
57:03 doesn't scrape on the ground
57:05 it makes no sense to perfect a
57:07 configuration that'll never be used
57:09 i don't think the least that's the way
57:11 it's going to work you want to get to
57:12 mars what are you kidding me
57:14 with a huge payload and all these people
57:16 inside i mean give me a break
57:18 what is daunting is to decipher i should
57:22 say
57:24 is that when you see these photographic
57:27 essays
57:28 of each one of the dozens and dozens of
57:32 massive projects they've come that
57:35 they've developed over the years
57:38 they are spending a tremendous amount of
57:40 money
57:42 so let's say we still believe again
57:46 i have my doubts that there's any rovers
57:48 anywhere
57:49 in the universe from us
57:53 if you're totally new to the show the
57:55 reason why
57:56 is that if they were going to build
57:58 these these little rovers right
58:00 especially you know perseverance that's
58:01 going to mars supposedly right now
58:04 they would test them on the moon first
58:07 but they can't
58:08 because if they go to the moon there's
58:10 no excuse why they wouldn't drive
58:12 in 17 to 20 years over to
58:16 the landing sites of the moon in the
58:19 last
58:19 month and a half they have passed some
58:21 law somewhere
58:23 it's supposed to be an international law
58:24 that no country is
58:27 to ever approach the united states of
58:29 america landing sites
58:32 why because they're not there that's why
58:36 no one would ever test rovers on the you
58:39 know
58:40 a planet that's like you know 30 to 70
58:44 million miles away
58:45 you just wouldn't do that it's too much
58:48 but now
58:49 what is our cynicism
58:52 towards all of these miraculous claims
58:55 going to the moon
58:56 going to mars going to venus flying by
58:59 all the planets
59:00 taking really close pictures of pluto
59:02 which just came in
59:05 i expect to find uh pluto the cartoon
59:07 character roaming around there
59:10 we call it the picture game on this
59:12 channel
59:14 the rocket flies out of sight out of
59:16 mine it's gone out of your consciousness
59:20 now you just wait look at the watch
59:24 and as long as the cg people come up
59:26 with the pictures
59:27 you're seeing and believing
59:30 plus you have this patriotic thing in
59:33 your soul
59:34 that you want this to occur hey i want
59:36 this to occur too
59:38 i just don't think it's occurring
59:41 for a million reasons i rewatched
59:44 the well we watched a documentary maybe
59:48 i watched it for the first time
59:50 on the russian vehicle that was supposed
59:52 to be going to the moon
59:54 and now that we know that those boosters
59:57 are two and a half times stronger than
59:58 any booster we had made by 1995
60:01 and they had that output in 1971.
60:06 their big problem was is that their
60:09 their huge rocket kept exploding
60:12 something was going wrong something was
60:13 out of balance
60:15 but now we bought these rockets straight
60:17 from a warehouse and
60:19 was it siberia and they worked
60:22 immediately two and a half times more
60:25 powerful
60:26 than nasa's best rocket in 1995.
60:30 the physicists of russia said
60:34 they weren't even with their super duper
60:37 rocket if it all worked they didn't
60:40 think they had enough
60:41 thrust to get out of the orbit of earth
60:44 and get to the moon
60:48 the amount of risk and innovation
60:51 and pure success that nasa had
60:55 and jpl has was off the charts
61:00 anytime it needed to succeed meaning the
61:03 public needed to get their money's worth
61:05 right
61:06 what's going to happen to a space
61:07 program if they continually fail
61:10 well you know we're gonna look at our
61:12 budget and go you know there's a lot of
61:13 other things that need to happen here
61:15 we have a million students with college
61:16 loans i thought we'd take care of some
61:17 of that
61:19 so they can't afford to lose it's a pr
61:22 game
61:23 now think about the picture game we're
61:25 accustomed to picture games being
61:28 nice pretty rocket on a launch pad could
61:30 have anything in it could be some
61:31 military thing
61:33 could just be a junker could just go
61:34 right into the atlantic ocean excuse me
61:37 okay
61:40 what do we see well if you ever visit
61:42 jpl's website and start looking at all
61:44 their mission
61:46 you know libraries of photographs man
61:48 they spend money like you wouldn't
61:50 believe
61:51 most amazing laboratories lots of shiny
61:54 metal
61:55 but now they want to keep as many people
61:58 in the dark as possible
62:00 so the workers have to believe that what
62:02 they're building is actually occurring
62:04 i think i told you guys a long time ago
62:07 there's a dude that lives
62:08 in costa mesa and he believes his father
62:11 well his father did do he did make the
62:14 product
62:15 that he made which is some very specific
62:18 bolts that were a part of either the
62:22 probably both the lunar lander and the
62:23 service module and so
62:25 in his heart of hearts i was involved in
62:27 an acting thing with this dude
62:30 in his heart of hearts he believes his
62:33 father
62:34 built objects that went to the moon it's
62:37 very priceless to him
62:39 and at no point did i ever say anything
62:40 man i was like man that's awesome that's
62:42 great
62:43 so this has to be factored in when we
62:45 think about
62:46 the human beings that are working for
62:48 these organizations
62:50 but the cool thing is is whatever they
62:52 end up creating that's a successful
62:54 anything for the military
62:59 it becomes a tool of the military
63:03 once it sits in the in the domain of the
63:06 military
63:06 for say 10 20 years i think it's
63:09 speeding up quite a bit but it used to
63:11 probably sit there for about 20 years
63:14 it can then be debriefed and
63:18 handed over to private sector and of
63:21 course
63:21 this technology is worth trillions of
63:24 dollars
63:26 for instance communication satellites
63:27 that make all of our cell phones work
63:30 all right well that's worth a tremendous
63:31 amount of money in it it's an annuity
63:33 you just put the thing in the sky and
63:35 just
63:35 print money you know what's funny about
63:38 it is even if the rocket costs like
63:40 a billion dollars to put a satellite up
63:42 there which it does not cost
63:44 to put a communication satellite up
63:45 there even if every one of them were a
63:48 billion dollars
63:49 they would have paid for their their
63:52 investment
63:54 probably in what two years with the
63:56 amount of people buying cell phones at
63:58 this point
64:00 so it's just like that old game where
64:02 they built the
64:03 san francisco bridge and there was a
64:05 toll and they said man as soon as the
64:06 bridge is
64:07 paid for there won't be another toll i
64:10 think
64:11 it's almost up to 10 bucks one way now
64:13 and certain people commute over that
64:14 thing
64:15 every single day 20 days a month
64:18 20 bucks a day i think there's a little
64:21 pass you can get that makes
64:22 a little bit cheaper but not much it's a
64:25 lie
64:26 it's a huge lie once a government gets
64:28 an artery
64:29 to filter money into something they'll
64:32 work
64:33 as little as they need to get that money
64:35 off of you
64:36 but when you talk about a space program
64:39 you're talking about billions coming in
64:40 constantly
64:42 to develop something that we will
64:44 actually use in the end so you have this
64:46 like
64:47 i mean if we were to reorganize the
64:48 country and get serious with this we
64:50 would
64:52 you know we'd have to always look at
64:54 educating our enemies so we got to be
64:55 careful about that
64:56 i saw a comedian yesterday night was
64:58 really funny because uh
65:01 because uh you know it's real important
65:02 that we protect our military secrets
65:06 unless you watch discovery channel and
65:09 he goes
65:09 he does this videos tune in and fight
65:11 you know we'll be right back to
65:13 tell our enemies another way to take out
65:15 our us military
65:17 we know that's not the case they do only
65:20 allow out
65:21 what they know that the enemy already
65:23 has
65:25 but you build a clean room you build a
65:28 robot
65:30 you build a satellite satellites your
65:32 satellites i think those things can be
65:34 stuck up there
65:35 no matter what model of the earth that
65:36 you appreciate
65:38 you know the worst uh theory i've heard
65:41 is that it's uh
65:42 it's all on balloons man and we know
65:44 that there are
65:45 weather balloons that yank satellites
65:47 into
65:48 low orbit because they crashed in
65:51 countries and the guys got their
65:52 cell phones and filmed them i've seen
65:54 probably
65:56 half a dozen videos with you know people
65:59 that are still just farmers
66:00 you know videotaping what they think is
66:02 a ufo and it's just a satellite
66:04 out of one of the military thing and we
66:07 don't even seem to show up to pick it up
66:09 and
66:09 it's just like ah whatever maybe it
66:11 self-destructs a little bit don't know
66:14 but the the photo game of jpo
66:18 although not easy none of this is easy
66:20 necessarily
66:23 it is feasible to say okay i mean how
66:26 many movie sets have you seen
66:28 i think they the with the pascal actor
66:31 who's in mandalorian he said you know
66:33 man the first day i showed up on set
66:35 everything's there these villages exist
66:38 these props exist
66:39 and he goes man the suspension of
66:40 disbelief is instantaneous because i'm
66:43 really
66:44 on a foreign planet in these these sets
66:47 for the mandalorian
66:49 right it's not going to be cheap but
66:51 come on
66:53 you have these individuals putting
66:54 together units that do things
66:58 but let's think about it you're building
67:00 a rover
67:01 you're building a lander okay
67:05 well they're giving you a bunch of sort
67:06 of bogus science that doesn't work
67:08 rocket engines that work in vacuums
67:10 hilarious ex
67:11 spacex just said that's not possible
67:14 they give a huge detailed thing about
67:16 the landing mechanism for perseverance
67:17 perseverance being the heaviest rover
67:20 that they can land on mars because the
67:22 atmosphere is so thin
67:23 that the motors can't slow it down for
67:26 impact
67:28 enough to not destroy anything that's
67:29 heavier
67:31 lunar lander on the moon no problem man
67:33 no problem no atmosphere
67:35 no problem and even though these rovers
67:38 are
67:38 geniusly designed i take nothing away
67:41 from them
67:42 even though the rockets are ingeniously
67:44 designed
67:45 and they do take off the real miraculous
67:49 thing that's occurring
67:51 is the claim that from the launch moment
67:54 this whole payload is actually going
67:56 where you think it's going
67:59 so you launch an empty rocket you put
68:02 your rover that you built and maybe they
68:03 do put it on there just to make sure all
68:05 the employees
68:06 say man i bolted that thing in there
68:07 it's definitely on there but they build
68:09 you know
68:10 half a dozen of these things
68:13 they need one on earth so they do all
68:15 that close microscopic you know
68:17 rock shaving and all this other stuff
68:19 they do need one for some of maybe these
68:20 live action shots they're in some
68:22 subterranean gigantic soundstage
68:26 and i want to say too if you've never
68:29 been to a soundstage before in hollywood
68:33 and you haven't been involved with like
68:34 massive
68:36 production somewhere a sound stage is
68:39 something to be
68:41 seen man i spoke at uh sony
68:44 pictures in 2008 and after i was done
68:48 we got a tour of sony studios
68:51 which is mgm i got to go into the sound
68:54 stage where
68:55 a lot of wizard of oz was actually
68:57 filmed and i got to go into the sound
68:59 booth where
69:01 they sang over the rainbow
69:04 judy garland and they told us they said
69:07 by the way you guys are going to be one
69:08 of the last people to ever go through
69:09 this
69:10 sound booth because it's being destroyed
69:13 for something else
69:15 now it was heavily upgraded since she
69:17 walked in there
69:18 but a sound soundstage is a massive
69:21 massive stage the you can't conceive
69:25 through making of videos and all that
69:26 kind of stuff
69:27 how high the ceiling is you can't
69:30 conceive of the footprint of these
69:31 buildings
69:32 and these things would be small compared
69:34 to what they would build
69:36 to host a moon landing
69:39 a mars landing of a man or a robot or
69:42 whatever
69:45 it's amazing these things are amazing
69:47 it's amazing these things can even stand
69:48 up and there's tons of them on a set
69:50 i mean on a studio backlot right
69:53 so definitely keep that in mind i'd
69:56 build the whole thing underground so it
69:58 could never be discovered by anybody
70:00 so there's definitely a situation or a
70:03 time when you're researching all this
70:04 kind of stuff for me
70:06 you're seeing just hundreds of
70:07 photographs of these amazing clean rooms
70:10 again i think i told you guys
70:12 years ago my co-host on mk ultra radio
70:15 kyle because he's in the effects
70:17 business
70:19 i believe he went to cape canaveral i
70:21 think that's where it was
70:23 i'm not sure why he was there he worked
70:25 on everything from
70:26 voyager up he did firefly and all this
70:29 other stuff the firefly movie
70:31 and so they just kind of they want to
70:33 show these guys the environment in case
70:34 they needed it for
70:35 modeling reasons or whatever
70:38 and he said you know look i saw these
70:40 satellites all wrapped up in clean rooms
70:42 he had to get in his bunny outfit and he
70:44 used to press
70:45 um cds for a tiny bit
70:48 before he got into the effects business
70:50 for technicolor
70:51 and so he had to go to work in that
70:53 whole outfit so he was very familiar
70:54 with it but he said look man there's a
70:56 lot of stuff being made
70:57 if it's not going there they're building
71:00 something
71:01 but it's just this impossible technique
71:06 of sending a rocket which is
71:09 tens of thousands of miles slower than
71:12 the planet that's coming by
71:14 and you don't have an algorithm for
71:17 wrapping around that planet using its
71:19 gravity to slow down and
71:21 really you got to speed up you got to
71:23 speed up i think it's something like uh
71:26 when i did my new mars mission here in
71:28 this episode the data is in there but
71:31 i think it's about a 20 000 mile an hour
71:33 discrepancy
71:34 between how fast we can move that object
71:36 towards mars and the
71:38 very orbital speed of mars how do you
71:41 gain
71:41 20 000 miles an hour without losing
71:44 complete control of the vehicle
71:47 and then the other big thing is how on
71:49 earth do you
71:51 catch how do you find this thing in
71:54 space
71:55 especially back in 1976 with the viking
71:57 missions
71:58 what optical system do you have again
72:02 when you're talking about millions of
72:03 miles away right
72:06 i think one of the averages like 58 000
72:09 miles away was one of the legitimate
72:10 trips to mars in the in the last decade
72:14 all right 58 million miles and you're
72:17 off
72:17 a millionth of a degree
72:20 just do your math man how many miles
72:22 you're going to be off you're going to
72:23 be off
72:24 tons of miles you're going to hit the
72:27 target
72:27 so you're constantly having to adjust
72:29 well how you going to adjust fire rocket
72:31 in space with no atmosphere
72:33 what did spacex say oh that doesn't work
72:35 oh yeah um
72:36 i just erased a whole bunch of space
72:38 history
72:40 and you have to know that these sci-fi
72:43 shows that we are shown on television
72:45 and movies
72:45 are there to orchestrate to you how
72:49 rockets work in space and so when you
72:51 see things like space 1999 i don't know
72:53 if you know this series it's actually a
72:54 british series
72:55 with martin landau really fun two
72:59 seasons of this show
73:00 most of them are on youtube by the way
73:02 you just have to look at them look them
73:03 up and then you can watch them
73:05 pretty stunning uh 1080p at least
73:09 well the whole premise of this show was
73:11 that the moon itself had a bunch of
73:13 nuclear waste
73:14 being stored on it from earth and
73:16 through a chain of events
73:18 in the first episode the pilot all that
73:20 exploded
73:21 on one side of the moon which is a big
73:23 giant bursty cloud
73:24 and that pushed the moon out of orbit
73:27 from earth
73:27 and so you have this space station this
73:30 moon base i should say
73:32 a space station moon base full of all
73:34 these people
73:36 now just floating in space on the moon
73:39 going through all the same adventures
73:40 that you saw in star trek
73:43 well they've got these really cool
73:44 vehicles i'll put them in the video here
73:46 for you
73:46 i'll put as many pictures into this one
73:48 as i can
73:49 but here comes and it lands on the moon
73:51 you know and it's blowing its retro
73:53 rockets and there's no atmosphere
73:55 that doesn't work you're going to have
73:58 to create
73:59 an engine that is moving ethereal matter
74:03 to create an anti-gravity field you have
74:06 to grab onto the fabric of the universe
74:08 which is
74:09 not easy and takes a tremendous amount
74:11 of electromagnetic
74:13 energy to start controlling that much
74:16 of this very thin stuff we call ether
74:21 it will be the way we get off this
74:22 planet if we ever do
74:25 and because this video will be watched
74:26 by itself without you having seen the
74:29 other videos i just want to throw this
74:30 little
74:31 repeat in there which is when donald
74:34 trump created space force
74:35 it was a giant upgrade to
74:38 solve the problem of
74:42 nasa probably not telling the truth and
74:43 jpl probably not telling the truth
74:46 because it removes off their ledger a
74:48 ton of research and development that can
74:50 now be pulled out of gpo
74:52 pulled out of nasa and put inside space
74:54 force for the military
74:57 so now space force is capable it's going
74:59 to take a
75:00 decade or so but capable of of going off
75:03 and spending a billion dollars on
75:06 you know icbm upgrades
75:09 and so now we don't have to filter that
75:11 money weird
75:12 we know we have enemies we know that
75:14 we're dealing with
75:16 peace through force algorithms
75:20 and now i think the intent is especially
75:23 with spacex
75:24 okay let's say they are handling using
75:27 public domain
75:29 designs and then upgrading them a little
75:30 bit and we know there's a lot of fakery
75:32 inside spacex go see my episode on
75:35 spacexypdq
75:37 it starts to bleed these organizations
75:39 dry to the point where
75:40 when they are dissolved eventually
75:44 we won't feel the need for them to exist
75:47 because we will have put together formal
75:49 companies to get this to happen let's
75:52 just run a quick scenario before we end
75:54 the show
75:55 space shuttle no longer flies okay
75:58 why don't i guess there's just better
76:02 ways you don't need men
76:03 up there to to dump satellites into
76:05 orbit and turn them on or whatever
76:08 and let's say the space station really
76:10 exists
76:12 and they turn that off in 2025 like the
76:14 current budget
76:15 says so we're no longer up there that
76:18 thing comes down crashing
76:20 maybe russian take it over for a little
76:21 while but i don't think anybody wants
76:23 that
76:23 financial burden so america is sitting
76:27 here going okay
76:27 we are no longer trying to explore mars
76:30 we're no longer concerned about putting
76:32 people on mars it really can't handle
76:35 human life doesn't have an atmosphere we
76:39 can breathe
76:41 if you ever played sim planet by
76:44 will wright you'll know that
76:46 terraforming mars takes
76:48 hundreds if not thousands of years with
76:51 equipment that would have to run
76:52 24 7 and however many uh days they got
76:56 in a year
76:57 if i remember it has fewer days than we
76:59 have it was really quick around the sun
77:02 which is astonishing which is why it's
77:04 going so much faster than our relative
77:06 speed
77:08 are we really going to have a fit as
77:09 human beings here on earth
77:11 what do you mean we're not going into
77:12 space
77:14 yeah you know what i'm going to tell you
77:16 right now it's going to be better for us
77:18 to simply create anti-gravity
77:21 here on earth with
77:24 no dependency on oxygenated atmosphere
77:28 of any kind
77:30 that it will be for us to keep throwing
77:32 old technology up into the sky
77:35 of course they don't want anti-gravity
77:37 to be known
77:38 because let's say i mean let's just
77:41 button this up with a really cool little
77:43 scenario
77:44 somehow some agency says whether it be
77:48 the next aurora vehicle right they keep
77:51 saying this triangle
77:53 that we keep seeing flying which could
77:55 be a wing but the way they always see
77:56 the triangle fly
77:58 with its three little lights which has
77:59 been viewed for decades now
78:02 it's responsible for one of the most
78:03 infamous
78:04 [Music]
78:05 men in black viewings but that was in
78:07 this century
78:09 let's say it's anti-gravity and that's
78:11 how they're able to move this thing
78:13 remember the tic tac
78:14 that just recently was released by the
78:16 pentagon
78:17 i believe it happened in o4 just off the
78:19 coast of where i live here
78:22 i saw a full-blown interview with the
78:23 top gun pilot that was chasing this
78:25 thing along with a lot of his buddies
78:28 and he said this thing was just toying
78:29 with us seemed to have complete
78:31 capability of moving around of course
78:35 with all the briefings he's had he just
78:36 simply said look man i've never been
78:40 briefed on anything that can do this
78:42 doesn't mean he can't do it that we
78:44 can't make something like that
78:46 we're not even trying we are not trying
78:49 to create this technology
78:50 as dr stephen greer said well i have
78:53 mixed feelings about i think he's a good
78:55 guy but
78:56 he might be tied into some disinfo don't
78:58 know
78:59 you said a brilliant statement he says
79:01 why is there not one university on earth
79:04 challenged with creating a zeropoint
79:07 energy system
79:08 when we should be challenging the entire
79:10 world to create a zero-point energy
79:12 system
79:13 once you get a zero-point energy system
79:15 created
79:18 you then can go grab anti-gravity very
79:21 quickly
79:22 so a lot of you are old enough to
79:24 remember when the sr-71 was debuted to
79:27 us
79:27 oh my gosh this thing's been flying
79:29 forever
79:31 then we now see the the b1 the b2
79:34 and the b2a that's coming out here
79:36 shortly
79:37 these things are you know remarkable
79:38 vehicles of course
79:40 but what if in some crazy debut of power
79:44 just like putin showing his fake
79:47 hypersonic missile which is missing
79:49 tremendous amount of frames
79:51 in his uh in his uh movie
79:55 picked apart by hollywood's best
79:58 they basically launched a real rocket
80:00 and then they just deleted a bunch of
80:01 frames to make it look like it was
80:02 moving way faster than it was
80:04 but our military had an air show
80:07 demonstrates an anti-gravity
80:09 supersonic vehicle maybe goes mach 20
80:12 who knows but it's there and you see it
80:15 there's no propellers there's no jets
80:18 it's just doing what it does
80:21 now what happens someone from the
80:24 private sector is going to want
80:26 that design but there's a bigger thing
80:29 at play here
80:32 i'm always mentioning the wright
80:33 brothers
80:36 so they go into the patent office 1904
80:39 with their photograph of having flown 42
80:41 feet in the air roughly
80:43 makes me wonder how they knew it was 42
80:44 feet i don't know must have done some
80:46 math on scale in the photograph and
80:47 trees and stuff
80:49 but the patent office told them we can't
80:50 allow you to patent this because
80:53 flight is impossible
80:57 so what's the problem there most of the
80:59 world 99.99 percent of the world doesn't
81:01 think flight is possible
81:03 other than a hot air balloon the right
81:06 place said yeah we just did it
81:08 took him three more years to get it done
81:10 stan myers
81:11 stan myers if i have a whole episode on
81:14 this dude
81:15 i recommend you go watch it because
81:16 it'll educate you on a brilliant
81:19 wonderful man that created a
81:23 tap water perforating piston that could
81:26 create
81:27 hydrogen at uh 600
81:30 a half an amp of power was creating 650
81:34 amps
81:35 of hydrogen as confirmed by oxford
81:37 university
81:39 he created a car that ran on tap water
81:42 it wasn't hydrogen until it hit the
81:45 piston
81:47 brilliant 25 percent of the pressure was
81:49 the
81:50 ignition of the actual hydrogen and 75
81:53 of the pressure to push the piston down
81:54 was the fracturing
81:56 mechanism to pop the hydrogen out of the
81:58 water
82:00 now they tell you that water or tap
82:01 water is too dirty to do it but he did
82:03 it
82:04 he was selling a 1500 retro kit to
82:07 people at the time
82:08 taking out the spark plugs putting his
82:09 little pistons in there you got the
82:11 valve for oxygen
82:13 it's all in there boom it worked great
82:16 they killed him 1998 poisoned him out of
82:19 dinner
82:22 now why haven't you heard of stan myers
82:25 if you haven't heard of him
82:27 why is it that you only learned maybe in
82:29 your 30s about nikola tesla
82:32 and now heat was harvesting infinite
82:34 power out of the plasma ball that is at
82:36 the center of the earth
82:37 not nickel iron and how he was also
82:40 harvesting
82:41 heathrow winds in his word wardencliffe
82:43 tower
82:45 why haven't you heard of these things
82:47 why are these things being held back
82:48 from you
82:49 why if you think you're a physicist if
82:51 you are one
82:52 or cosmologist and i said ether and you
82:55 went man at guys stupid man
82:57 we know ether doesn't exist there was an
82:59 experiment once
83:02 okay experiments completely flawed
83:04 completely misunderstands what ether is
83:08 why is that why did einstein say ether
83:10 didn't exist when tesla
83:12 through faraday built every single piece
83:14 of equipment
83:15 in electrical engineering based on
83:17 ethereal winds how could
83:20 tesla and faraday track it at 50 times
83:22 the speed of light and eric dollar
83:23 confirmed it in
83:24 79-81 using the same technique they did
83:29 it's because of conceptual belief
83:32 systems that you can actually
83:34 accomplish something the greatest thing
83:36 about jack parsons
83:38 regardless of all of his sex paids with
83:40 aleister crowley
83:42 was he wasn't going to take no for an
83:44 answer
83:46 he wanted it so bad he was willing to
83:49 call
83:50 in the devil into his bedroom and sell
83:53 his soul before he realized what forever
83:55 means of course
83:56 let's hope he wasn't successful there is
83:59 a giant
84:00 game to control your perception of what
84:03 you can do
84:04 if any of you watched westworld there
84:07 was a scene by the actor that played gus
84:09 and i forget his name he's one of the
84:10 greatest actors he's now mandalorian as
84:12 well
84:14 i think he's kind of cuban or something
84:15 you're not sure
84:18 but there was a scene where he talked
84:20 about the elephant and the peg
84:24 big giant elephants at zoos that aren't
84:26 raised you know aren't left alone in the
84:28 wild
84:29 can be held in place by a spike in the
84:32 ground and a little rope around their
84:34 neck
84:35 now they got plenty of power to pull
84:37 that spike out of the ground
84:39 but why don't they move why don't they
84:41 try to pull it out of the ground because
84:44 when they were little
84:45 they had that rope around their neck and
84:47 a spike in the ground
84:49 and that spike is strong enough to stop
84:50 a little tiny elephant
84:53 and they're left for years trying to
84:56 pull something out of ground i can't
84:58 so when they get older they're trained
85:00 that they can't
85:02 and that's a huge gain that's played on
85:04 you in this world
85:06 they want you to think your freedoms for
85:08 instance are optional
85:10 when they're inalienable the fact that
85:12 you exist
85:13 makes you just as good as any human
85:15 being you can see in this world in terms
85:17 of what you deserve
85:18 as a human being but they don't want you
85:21 to see that
85:23 and i'll just give you a little test you
85:25 can do with a random stranger
85:26 if not a family member oh a little kid
85:29 would probably be pretty good at this
85:32 failing it anyway the game is this
85:35 you ask a random stranger if you had to
85:37 go to the moon how would you do it
85:40 and they will probably fairly accurately
85:42 tell you about saturn 5 about retro
85:44 rockets about
85:45 lunar module service module even if they
85:47 don't know the name of those things
85:50 rockets working in vacuums they're going
85:52 to tell you that
85:54 go get someone with a phd a fresh ph.d
85:57 in cosmology and say
85:59 does ether exist no no no
86:02 gosh doesn't exist their brains are shut
86:05 off
86:06 by industrialized education
86:09 there's the dude i point you guys to
86:10 name bruce lipton who figured out the
86:11 medical industry
86:14 is full of a bunch of dogma quite
86:16 literally they have the dogma theories
86:19 so you know that if you believe that you
86:22 are awake
86:23 you've been red pilled you know one
86:25 you'll never be blue pill without a
86:27 without a lobotomizing
86:31 process to your life but it's because
86:33 you've started to undo the chains on
86:35 your mind
86:36 so you can see things differently now
86:39 you can get a little bit over
86:40 you can take the algorithms of truth and
86:42 apply them to things that aren't true
86:43 and get yourself all upside down very
86:45 quickly
86:46 quite frankly that's part of the process
86:48 it's sort of your 10 days of darkness
86:50 you're like oh gosh i started thinking
86:52 everything was a conspiracy
86:54 but there are a lot of them out there
86:56 now whether or not jpl's accomplished
86:58 this kind of stuff
86:58 again i'll just reiterate the uh the
87:01 pictures of
87:02 europa and the algorithm of neil adams
87:06 and the expanding
87:07 earth theory are probably the best
87:09 evidence they've ever been in space
87:13 but jesus with the amount of successes
87:16 that nasa has
87:18 claimed and jpl has claimed individually
87:21 there's no excuse while we haven't
87:22 backed the moon there's no excuse why we
87:25 don't have a moon base
87:27 there's no excuse why we don't have that
87:29 wheel from 2001 spinning out there is a
87:31 little proxy to get there
87:34 nasa should try to cure world hunger and
87:37 starvation
87:38 and uh pretty much the same thing but
87:41 poverty
87:41 and every single ailment of the world
87:43 because their success is just
87:45 absolute after a certain point
87:48 yes we had two space shuttles crash
87:52 seems like that's almost impossible
87:54 because
87:55 you know they always succeed well
87:57 sometimes the prop
87:59 has a problem so anyway hopefully you
88:02 thought this was
88:02 a little fun adventure for those of you
88:05 coming in on podcasts there
88:06 was always a lot of photographs with
88:08 these sort of episodes so if you like to
88:10 watch that sort of thing please get over
88:12 to youtube and take a look or bid shoot
88:16 and if you haven't been to
88:16 deepthoughtsradio.com in this
88:20 very strange era in history that we're
88:22 in
88:23 where freedom of speech seems to be up
88:25 for uh grabs
88:26 definitely bookmark that page and if you
88:28 like the content on this channel
88:31 i also want to stress with you guys
88:33 there are a lot of episodes
88:35 in this channel if you like
88:38 any of the episodes the the format of
88:41 how i talk the format of the subject
88:43 matter
88:43 even if it's the most esoteric weird
88:45 title
88:47 it should grab you because you're
88:49 interested in thinking
88:50 that's the name of the game here more
88:52 than anything else
88:53 these are particular episodes where we
88:55 try to talk about a lot of facts
88:57 a lot of speculation here and there but
88:59 definitely get up there and go backwards
89:01 through this stuff
89:02 there's nothing that warms my heart more
89:03 than when i start getting
89:05 one of you and there's probably three of
89:07 you right now doing it tremendously
89:09 you're going back through all the old
89:11 episodes i'm getting a comment from you
89:12 like every two hours man
89:14 it's awesome and your comments are
89:16 always really well thought so
89:18 there seems to be sort of a common
89:22 denominator with those that go back
89:24 they seem to be the most intelligent
89:26 viewers now although a lot of you have
89:28 been here for years and you don't need
89:29 to go back because you watched them when
89:30 they came out
89:31 so super duper kudos to you as well
89:34 which is why on the website we have a
89:35 store with the brand new
89:37 deep thoughts radio university shirt
89:40 from 2015
89:42 that's when the show started that's why
89:44 it has that number on it it's for
89:46 everyone all the time just want to promo
89:49 that a little bit but we have
89:51 several choices for video we have
89:54 again we have brighton which is a joke
89:56 we've got a couple other
89:58 things like gab has gab tv i just want
90:01 you to know they only have
90:03 like a 2 meg upload limit that's also a
90:06 bit shoot as well but they also only
90:07 have like an hour's worth of play
90:09 so a lot of these folks are trying to
90:11 get their platforms up they just don't
90:12 have the
90:13 the hard drive space to to host all this
90:17 stuff
90:17 i have applied on bitshoot to have my
90:20 youtube feed
90:21 instantly show up on bid shoot like lbry
90:24 does
90:26 but it hasn't taken effect i think that
90:29 what i understand midship's been run by
90:31 like four guys and i'm sure they're
90:33 absolutely overwhelmed
90:34 when i sent them the email which is
90:36 following their directions to apply for
90:37 that
90:39 they instantaneously sent me back a
90:40 boulder plate email that said hey you
90:42 know we're really busy and
90:43 so at some point that'll be automated
90:45 which would be really nice because then
90:47 i won't have to download things
90:49 i want you to know too if you're
90:50 noticing this on bed shoot
90:52 you may or may not notice the
90:55 the videos are limited to two gig
90:58 uploads
90:59 and they don't tell you that in the
91:01 button but they simply won't process
91:03 your video if it goes over two gigs
91:04 that's the big problem
91:06 the problem is when i do big episodes
91:08 like this one even 1080p
91:11 can be 1080p could be bigger than
91:14 the 4k i don't know why but that's i got
91:16 the best compression software on planet
91:18 earth
91:19 for some reason i've taken um four gig
91:22 files and they'll turn into like eight
91:23 gig files like when i go down in
91:25 resolution
91:26 don't know what's going on there i've
91:28 tried several different products
91:29 all the same estimates so some of those
91:32 videos are going in at
91:33 720p simply just to get underneath the
91:37 uh
91:38 the threshold there hopefully if they
91:40 succeed more and more with more
91:41 subscribers please go to bid shoot and
91:43 create an account
91:44 they seem to be the the best straight
91:46 shooters no censorship
91:48 no popularity contest like brighton to
91:50 get your extra videos up there
91:52 i will say that if you want to see more
91:54 in breakdown if that's your choice then
91:56 you need to go up and watch
91:58 all my videos as much as you can because
91:59 i think i have to have about another 150
92:01 views before i get my next 50 videos
92:04 from season 1 back in 2015 2016.
92:09 hopefully those next 50 will go a little
92:11 faster on viewing
92:12 but i mean people are watching me in a
92:14 whole different format back in those
92:16 days
92:16 so one day boys and girls will be
92:19 popular enough to be on a freedom of
92:21 speech channel called brayton.com
92:23 not holding my breath but we also have
92:25 all the audio you'd ever want if you're
92:27 only on video
92:28 i use podcast addict on my android phone
92:31 don't know if that's on apple haven't
92:33 tried
92:34 don't have an iphone we'll never have an
92:36 iphone
92:37 we have an all new remastered season 1
92:39 and a different channel on youtube just
92:41 get over there
92:42 subscribe watch them all unsubscribe
92:44 it's good do know you're being
92:45 unsubscribed
92:47 we've had one of our listeners come in
92:48 and he said he's been unsubscribed like
92:50 three times this year
92:51 you know i mean it's just bad so the
92:54 censorship
92:54 and the shadow banning is all in full
92:56 effect on this channel
92:57 which should tell you that the content
92:59 is actually pretty good
93:01 there's a couple ways to donate so there
93:04 is patreon
93:04 and paypal for all of you who support me
93:07 on patreon thank you so much
93:09 like to welcome anyone to get over there
93:11 what you get for that is there's no tier
93:13 system
93:14 so a dollar will get you the same thing
93:16 as uh 20 30 bucks but you do get into
93:19 credits forever
93:20 and if you're active uh there's
93:23 different tiers
93:24 of contributions so if you put in you
93:26 know more than say
93:27 20 bucks you're you get a special color
93:29 you filtered
93:31 filtered towards the top there but the
93:33 other big thing is you get the episodes
93:35 the second i
93:36 push upload on my computer so i just
93:38 literally when i'm waiting for upload i
93:39 got the
93:40 link i put it in the patreon page so
93:43 within an hour or so you're watching the
93:45 episode
93:46 the current format is you get it about
93:48 12 hours before everybody else
93:50 unless i haven't done a video for a very
93:51 long time and i managed to get it edited
93:53 by noon
93:54 but i am also releasing these things in
93:57 a midday time frame so those of you in
93:59 europe
94:00 or elsewhere hopefully you're getting it
94:02 when you're either starting a new day in
94:04 australia or you're getting it
94:08 in fact most my australian people are on
94:09 patreon but you'll get it as you come
94:12 home from work
94:13 and now i'm launching everything on the
94:14 same moment so
94:17 podcast goes bit shoot usually takes
94:19 just a little bit because i've had to
94:21 yank it down and push it up
94:22 but now i'm doing everything a day ahead
94:23 of time so it's usually all ready for
94:25 you guys
94:25 so that's a long bumper but i want to
94:27 give you guys sort of the
94:30 back backstage stuff every once in a
94:32 while
94:34 but anyway take care of yourself and
94:35 someone else and i'll see you in the
94:36 next deep thoughts
94:37 over now
94:46 [Music]
95:04 [Applause]
95:10 [Music]
95:15 you
