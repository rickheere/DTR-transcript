00:00 [Music]
00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen today is one of those days
00:39 where I'm having a subject sort of push
00:44 in on my brain meaning it wants to be
00:48 covered and I'm sinner going really
00:51 don't I have to agree
00:53 and it's like no nope you got to do this
00:58 episode I could just see it now I see
01:02 somebody later and this is where they
01:04 really you know came to the conclusion
01:07 he's a schizophrenic the subject is mind
01:10 over matter when I see those words in my
01:15 mind they're a little cliche there's a
01:19 Twilight Zone episode that's not quite
01:21 exactly the same title but it's
01:26 essentially the same thing where a
01:28 gentleman is having this life where he
01:34 lives alone he goes to work he can't
01:38 stand humans he can't stand them during
01:41 his commute in the morning he can't
01:42 stand his co-workers as a kid that
01:44 always spills something on him every day
01:46 smells a coffee on him and the kid in
01:51 order to say sorry for spilling it on in
01:54 one day gave him this book just sort of
01:58 a mind over matter book so the guy takes
02:03 the book home and he meditates on it and
02:08 wishes away everyone but himself
02:11 and now he's in New York by himself and
02:13 he goes to work and
02:13 he realizes Jesus I don't really want
02:17 nobody in the world I just don't want
02:19 people that aren't like myself and so
02:23 then the world's populated again except
02:26 he plays all the characters he plays
02:28 everyone have a lot bunch of goofy masks
02:30 to that walked by the camera really fast
02:32 which is kind of funny but he plays a
02:33 woman he plays a man he plays an old man
02:37 then he realizes the last thing he wants
02:40 is a world it's all like himself right
02:43 so then he wishes it back the way it was
02:46 he comes to work and he's so happy that
02:49 everyone stare that the pain in the ass
02:51 commutes back
02:53 sure enough the kid spills another
02:55 coffee on him but this time he looks at
02:58 the kid and he's like in his mind you
03:01 can see on his face he's like good to
03:02 have you back kid and then the kid at
03:05 the very end says well would you think
03:06 about that book I gave you is there
03:07 anything to it and he saw now it's all
03:09 hogwash or whatever he said obviously it
03:13 worked totally he just he went the
03:17 course on changing the world right now
03:23 there have been movements and I have
03:25 talked about them during a law of
03:27 attraction episodes but this mind over
03:31 matter thing has been sort of woven into
03:34 other episodes and never been the core
03:36 function of an episode and I think that
03:39 will end up going a different place if
03:42 we make a dedicated episode on it
03:44 it's obviously pushing in today so we'll
03:46 let it happen so how literal of a
03:52 statement or an episode is this going to
03:55 be based on the statement are we really
03:56 talking about we're gonna have an
03:58 hour-long conversation about controlling
03:59 the universe yeah I think so
04:03 but I think that for this particular
04:06 episode instead of it being more obtuse
04:12 and a general feeling but we'll get into
04:15 that a well as well but it'll be more on
04:18 the minutia level there'll be a little
04:22 tiny repeat from probably the law of
04:25 attraction or existentialism
04:28 episode I just think that when we
04:31 reformat things you get different
04:33 epiphanies and different strengths and
04:35 there's got to be a reason why this is
04:37 pushing it again and in my brain what if
04:41 one of the greatest secrets is that you
04:45 and I control this universe I've said
04:50 this in previous episodes like I
04:52 literally let him with that statement
04:55 since I made that episode I have thought
04:58 about it quite a bit and I tell two
05:05 stories from people that are probably
05:08 the least likely to tell me a story
05:09 that's fictional where you know I don't
05:15 want to I don't identify them just in
05:17 case this was sort of sold to me in
05:19 confidence but it's no big deal but one
05:23 of my friends read a book about mind
05:27 over matter right in the early 60s and
05:29 he told me that he got to a point where
05:32 he was controlling so much that it
05:37 freaked him out and he had to sort of
05:40 detox out of it because I guess it was
05:42 fairly easy get into a relative of mine
05:47 a female you didn't have any spooky
05:52 nature to it but they were able to
05:55 predict a lot of things that were
05:57 happening like people coming out
05:59 elevators people who were calling like
06:00 the identity of people so just sort of a
06:04 predicting sense of the universe not a
06:08 controlling sense of the universe the
06:09 first individual was controlling and so
06:13 what's interesting is is I think that
06:16 man
06:16 toys with the nature of being God up to
06:20 the point of saying look I don't want to
06:22 control every air molecule every water
06:26 molecule in the ocean or whatever but I
06:28 want to make sure this job comes my way
06:31 this person likes me control the winds
06:36 of life right the WI ns
06:39 of life but let's just play a game with
06:43 our perception of our reality as because
06:47 we're really on this in season 3 here
06:50 and there's a lot of questions from you
06:52 about my perception of reality and you
06:55 know how it works
06:58 truth of the matter is there's plenty of
07:00 episodes that go on at length to answer
07:04 my perspective on this whole thing but
07:05 what I am figuring out is that you know
07:12 we I think we are probably born fairly
07:18 open to things in the universe right
07:21 we're just a spirit floating into a body
07:23 we're starting to get our bearings
07:24 together now whether or not we do a hell
07:31 of a lot of bonding to this universe
07:32 while we're in our mother's womb is
07:34 anybody's guess right a baby starts
07:39 kicking a baby I think as has been noted
07:43 as making noises at times but then a
07:45 baby is born and it has to adapt very
07:52 very quickly to a world that is
07:55 traveling at speeds that must seem
07:59 infinitely fast I mean think about the
08:01 metabolism of a child in a womb the
08:05 average ping of a thought and then
08:08 hopefully there's a bit of a quarantine
08:10 from the thoughts going through the
08:11 mother although we know that stress and
08:13 a mother can freak out a kid too
08:15 hopefully kids not the drinking
08:18 aspartame and alcohol and smoking weed
08:21 but the kid is born and there's such a
08:25 circus around a child you have the
08:29 birthing process which can be really
08:32 intense depending on the the smoothness
08:36 of the birth itself there's all kinds of
08:38 little complications which aren't
08:39 life-threatening but can cause a
08:41 tremendous amount of traffic around a
08:43 child's body dim Elissa child gets
08:46 wrapped up a bunch of family members
08:48 want to say hi a bunch of family members
08:51 want to hold the child
08:52 which hopefully for the child is a
08:54 wonderful thing but against it goes on
08:58 and on and on right and there's a there
09:01 is a point where you get some stability
09:04 but you're kind of freaked out being a
09:06 parent if you're sure if it's your first
09:07 child especially because you're like am
09:08 i doing everything right we're doing
09:09 right babies do eat and excrete and
09:14 parents have to be there for every step
09:15 of the way well why go on about babies
09:19 well the reason why is this is where we
09:23 first adopt paradigms of existence
09:29 paradigms are usually rule sets there's
09:34 boundaries I don't care if your room is
09:37 octagon shape
09:39 square triangle circular it doesn't
09:42 matter there is a bounding box around
09:44 you when you adopt a paradigm what can
09:48 you do and what can't you do
09:50 but it is this binding to our universe
09:55 which is I'm probably going to guess I
09:58 wouldn't be wrong if I said necessary
10:03 but the level at which we bind to this
10:07 universe is what is it should be in
10:09 question for every single one of you if
10:13 you bind too hard and too early and you
10:18 don't work to remove yourself from it
10:21 maybe it's impossible or becomes more
10:26 difficult
10:27 I shouldn't shouldn't say impossible but
10:31 you're going to have to break down a
10:34 bigger door with more locks on it right
10:36 if any of you try to kick in a door
10:39 worst thing you can do is use your
10:41 shoulder just you know you basically
10:44 step towards the door and put the heel
10:47 of your shoe right at the lock level
10:49 just to the left or right of the knob
10:52 and usually that pops the lock but
10:55 imagine you loosely shut the door you
10:58 could push it open with your hand you
11:01 loosely lock to the universe then you
11:02 become more malleable to explore the
11:05 universe at a
11:06 later time but if that's a door in the
11:11 Bronx Brooklyn and the 70s
11:15 it's got 22 locks on that thing dead
11:18 bolts you are not getting that thing
11:19 that you might as well just knock the
11:21 door in or knocked a wallet in excuse me
11:22 to get the door open right and we know
11:26 if people like this the you know friends
11:29 and family that have really bound
11:31 themselves to this universe and for
11:35 whatever reason the unknown is
11:38 terrifying
11:39 right some people get in the ocean deep
11:44 ocean and they are terrified they look
11:47 down and it's just like light goes away
11:48 this is the bottomless pit and other
11:51 people are like man put me in a scuba
11:54 diving suit or you know one of those
11:57 sorry pressurized suits they can go to
12:00 the bottom of the ocean and drop me
12:03 seven miles like somebody did that right
12:05 seven miles at the bottom of the ocean
12:09 incredible right so there's different
12:14 types of people the more one the more
12:16 that a person is terrified the more
12:17 they're going to say I'm going to adopt
12:22 paradigms like crazy and I do not want
12:25 to debate this with you it is everything
12:28 I can do to hang on to this paradigm I
12:30 have adopted and we don't need to change
12:35 those people and I'm not mentioning them
12:37 in order to get you to think that we
12:39 should change anyone else I'm trying to
12:41 kind of come around you from behind and
12:45 say you know Park right next to you at
12:48 one point I'm like okay how hard do you
12:52 think you adopted your reality you know
12:56 it's one thing to sit and philosophize
12:57 about oh is this a matrix and a computer
13:00 or is that it like I've been saying
13:01 recently well it's another thing to say
13:03 well what do you think and if you have
13:06 an ulterior instinct about reality then
13:12 how committed are you to that alternate
13:16 from the one that you wake up into every
13:19 single day
13:20 now what's interesting is is right off
13:22 the bat when we think about true mind
13:26 over matter as it is sold to us in
13:29 novels and television shows it's usually
13:32 some sort of telekinetic thing it's
13:35 perhaps some fusion where you make
13:39 something occur or sorry make something
13:41 exist out of nothing you know it's it's
13:44 sort of the video game version of mind
13:48 over matter then you get to your more
13:51 star treky stuff where someone is
13:53 changing dimensions of reality as a
13:56 result of thinking a certain way Wesley
14:00 Crusher mm-hmm okay so we haven't really
14:06 determined the ruleset of what mind over
14:09 matter
14:09 could mean and on this show I think one
14:14 of the most interesting things that
14:17 occurs to me has to do with accidentally
14:22 messing up yourself it's like the end of
14:25 altered states the movie with William
14:27 Hurt he gets his wish but he gets to a
14:32 point where he almost loses himself in
14:34 the universe never to return and perhaps
14:38 who knows if he had vanished at the end
14:43 and none of this runs the movie for you
14:46 for you guys you guys should all see
14:48 that movie brilliant film brilliant
14:52 brilliant movie but if he had lost
14:55 himself what'd he have disappeared from
14:56 time itself and everyone's like who what
14:59 where God it was really strange I was
15:01 sitting on the bed now I'm naked in the
15:03 hallway I don't know how that happened
15:05 the beautiful thing about the universe
15:07 in especially when you and I are in a
15:10 workshop of the mind toying with these
15:14 notions is that there is no evidence
15:18 that someone has manipulated the world
15:20 that least that were in in any
15:22 supernatural way that we see it right
15:25 there's a point in thinking about these
15:28 sort of things where you think well
15:29 maybe it's because I don't have enough
15:31 faith in my ID
15:32 the Bible says if you have faith you can
15:34 move a mountain alright well do you look
15:38 at people that are mentally insane
15:41 whether they be temporarily insane or
15:43 there are committed soul to insanity
15:46 don't you think that they believe they
15:48 can do things with complete faith that
15:52 they can't do some people think they're
15:54 superheroes
15:55 some people think they're Winston
15:56 Churchill Jesus Christ they don't
16:00 actually turn into those people and they
16:01 don't actually incur any powers okay so
16:09 it seemed that the universe has a fairly
16:13 resilient algorithm you can't just think
16:18 it away for everyone else now I guess
16:23 technically speaking someone could think
16:26 themselves out of the universe
16:28 and as long as the universe completely
16:29 and entirely forgets them no one would
16:31 be the wiser the way that we would
16:36 probably notice such a thing as if for
16:40 instance you're a child and your parents
16:43 will themselves completely out of
16:45 existence as in they never existed and
16:47 there you are the descendant of a family
16:50 that never gave birth to you that might
16:53 be one way we would find such a thing
16:55 right so what's the next step down if
16:59 you can't make course adjustments to the
17:01 universe are you allowed to make
17:02 fine-tuning adjustments to the universe
17:04 I think that that's happened to me I
17:09 think it's happened to friends of mine
17:11 and I'm willing to bet whether or not
17:13 you realize it or not you've done it
17:14 yourself which is really interesting
17:18 because of the whole you know the the
17:21 butterfly effect that if we did change a
17:26 little something for ourselves a little
17:28 chatzky because the universe allows that
17:30 or because we simply have that much
17:32 energy influence over the universe that
17:37 it starts to change the planet and let
17:39 me give you a better analogy to that we
17:42 are a finite living
17:44 preacher right it doesn't matter when I
17:47 say this as to whether or not we have a
17:49 soul or not I believe we do but we have
17:53 a collection of energy that makes up our
17:54 organized history and our mind thus our
17:57 identity etc etc all right but just like
18:03 a 1.5 double-a battery 1.5 volt double-a
18:09 battery it's not a 9-volt battery
18:11 it could be mixed with other batteries
18:13 and we could capacitate up the energy
18:16 and create a big shock that's way more
18:17 than that
18:19 but by itself it only has so much energy
18:22 okay so if I'm going to effect
18:26 electronic equipment with this battery
18:29 there's a limit to how much influence
18:31 the the battery can have on the circuit
18:34 I think that might be the design of man
18:39 and imagine if the amount of energy that
18:42 we are allocated as a living being is
18:44 sort of in proportionate to some
18:48 evolutionary law of the universe and
18:50 again but when I say evolution I want
18:53 you to do you know freaked out because
18:55 I'm talking about whoever created this
18:57 place
18:58 I'm just not mentioning their name right
19:00 off the bat so we are a battery right
19:04 just like the matrix individual
19:06 batteries what's beautiful about this
19:08 analogy and your ability to influence
19:11 your halo of existence right is that you
19:15 would have an area of influence that
19:17 your energy is capable of changing now
19:22 it perhaps isn't in some strict sense
19:26 that you're constricted in 3d space you
19:28 could actually potentially again remote
19:31 view anywhere in the universe sort of
19:33 thing right but now imagine what I've
19:37 said several times on the show which is
19:38 that when you mix the power of two
19:40 individuals you don't necessarily get
19:46 one plus one equals two power you get in
19:50 my opinion potentially an exponential
19:52 I'm not a power maybe two to the power
19:56 of two maybe two to the power of ten
19:58 I don't know it does seem a lot more
20:00 than two individuals getting together
20:02 and it could be that you're resonating
20:05 and capacitating and increasing your
20:08 energy aperture to the universe and thus
20:12 controlling more of it the more you have
20:14 mine the more did you create outcomes
20:16 that are the some of your thoughts right
20:20 the way I have a new neighbor that has a
20:22 screaming child so it was one of the
20:24 episodes it was really kind of area it
20:26 was like a screaming kid in the
20:27 background that's not some torture
20:30 chamber in my neighborhood that is my
20:33 neighborhood brand-new there was a time
20:38 in my life we're probably in 1989 as a
20:41 matter of fact where I was really
20:44 getting into this and I'm not sure why
20:46 because I didn't have this those other
20:49 stories that I just told you from other
20:50 people I didn't have any books on it I
20:52 think I just kind of got bored and was
20:55 thinking well let's try to figure out
20:56 something where my mind could influence
20:59 the results of something and it could be
21:02 witnessed by other people because that's
21:05 the that's the clincher right you could
21:06 do something by yourself and you're like
21:07 I did it and then there was like sure
21:09 you did but I came up with a pretty good
21:11 trick I was living I was renting a
21:16 garage I mentioned this a couple times
21:19 from a family and camera it was nice it
21:22 was like you know got a really nice
21:23 fold-out sofa bed got a bar in it
21:28 exercise equipment a piano I mean it was
21:31 nice really nice pantry everything in
21:33 there carpeted beautiful and that but
21:38 somewhat one of the kids had created a
21:40 pottery thing in school and hung it on
21:43 fish line it was way off to the left
21:46 up towards the ceiling and what I was
21:51 trying to figure out was okay let's say
21:54 the mind can create waves of energy that
21:58 can influence matter and let's just say
22:03 a bit like the Dagobah scene where Yoda
22:08 is trying to get Luke Skywalker to lift
22:09 up the x-wing fighter out of the swamp
22:12 he looks at the extreme finer and and
22:14 just thinks it's too big I can't move
22:17 that and thence this is where Yoda is
22:20 like always with you what can't be done
22:23 you know something like that he tries
22:28 and he fails but it's because it's lack
22:29 of faith and then Yoda is just like boom
22:33 polls that thing out sets it down and
22:36 just looks at I'm like you see I told
22:38 you you were a [ __ ] so my idea was to
22:42 say I'm looking at this thing and it
22:45 would typically just rotate in one
22:47 direction and I thought it's hanging on
22:50 fishing wire so in the area of gravity
22:54 which is more aligned with the vector
22:56 perpendicular to the earth the
22:58 rotational energy is probably going to
23:02 be that of which it winds up the tension
23:06 in the fishing line and then it reverses
23:08 out the tension the fishing line it's
23:10 just going to go in this cycle from left
23:11 to right based on the tension on the
23:13 line of course if someone opens the door
23:15 or the air conditioner turns on or
23:17 something perhaps to get moved but I
23:19 don't think we had an air conditioner in
23:21 this place I don't remember a heater in
23:25 this place either but it must have been
23:26 there as well
23:27 anyway it's midsummer I had a buddy of
23:30 mine for whatever reason my buddies like
23:32 to spend the night in this room because
23:34 it was just cool as hell we had cots and
23:37 stuff that we could unfold and there was
23:40 some get-together where people had to
23:44 stay at the house and I had one of my
23:47 really good friends staying in the room
23:51 he's a descendant of the Calvin family
23:52 which is kind of cool and I had been
23:55 experimenting meditating on this little
23:58 piece of pottery I'm a swear to god it
23:59 was like a maybe a three inch triangle
24:03 it was very organic we could just cut it
24:07 out of something and fired it and
24:08 painted it and so I explained the whole
24:11 thing to my friend I said look I've been
24:12 experimenting moving this thing with my
24:15 mind because of its low tension right
24:20 and he's like really and I said he
24:22 doesn't he's super skeptical guy which
24:24 is great I said yeah and I think I'm
24:26 seeing results I'm not telling you I'm
24:28 seeing results but I think I'm seeing
24:30 results and he goes okay let's do it
24:34 I said all right and I'm sitting up in
24:36 the bed he's at the cot he's much closer
24:39 to it and he's just looking at it and I
24:43 said okay I'm not gonna do anything
24:46 until it finishes rotating in its
24:49 current direction reverses because at
24:52 that point it should want to continue in
24:54 that direction for a lot longer than me
24:57 intervening with it would allow and he
25:02 staring at this thing and I said you
25:05 tell me when to turn this thing was that
25:08 way it's not me saying Oh or something
25:11 random happened and that was me
25:12 and so he's looking at it he goes okay
25:14 do it sure enough I could stop it and
25:17 move it back the other way I know this
25:20 sounds absolutely childish and
25:21 ridiculous and one of those
25:23 attention-getting stories that people
25:24 tell but then he would say it again and
25:28 say it again and I was just in the
25:30 frickin zone on this thing and he was
25:33 like wow wow wow that's amazing and I
25:36 said this is really happening right
25:38 we're not like both tripping on acid
25:41 somehow right what was interesting is I
25:48 would experiment with this thing without
25:50 him there and when something really
25:53 behaves the way that you are trying it
25:58 like it when it happens basically you
25:59 don't necessarily run outside and go
26:02 everybody come and look because at that
26:05 point I think I would probably be afraid
26:09 that this you know the more spectators
26:12 the I would have doubts in myself and
26:14 thus doubted my ability to move this in
26:16 therefore wouldn't work with just my
26:18 really close friend in the room we
26:20 played with this thing all night I don't
26:25 remember if he tried but the idea was he
26:29 was coming in a cynic and thinking
26:32 seriously this is ridicu
26:34 you can't do what you're saying they
26:37 wasn't an [ __ ] or anything like that
26:38 but anyway it showed me that maybe
26:42 there's a tiny bit of influence but now
26:45 when you watch a movie like Carrie for
26:47 those of you are my age or older you
26:49 know she's she's tearing up the whole
26:52 world you know there's all kinds of
26:53 superheroes now they've telekinetic
26:55 powers right but you know grabbing a you
26:59 know x-wing fighter grabbing a aircraft
27:02 carrier moving it with your mind you
27:04 know who knows if that's possible if you
27:07 just simply had faith maybe faith opens
27:09 up the energy aperture of ether winds or
27:12 whatever winds were made out of as a
27:14 living soul being maybe it is possible I
27:17 mean you are affecting what we would
27:20 call mass which would be in my opinion
27:22 II throw winds clustering together to
27:24 make atomic forces and so your mind is
27:28 sitting in there in the mind realm
27:29 having to convince some sort of conveyor
27:32 belt of influence on an object to get it
27:37 to change but again we have well we have
27:41 stories okay I think I mentioned one of
27:43 these in season one we have stories of
27:46 Tibetan monks and I had a really close
27:50 friend of mine tell me a story about
27:52 Tibetan monk and you know I'm trying to
27:58 filter this personnel to see okay you an
28:01 attention-getter I mean are you BSE me
28:03 because I take my stories really really
28:05 serious you know I mean like my
28:07 recollections of my life you know when
28:10 getting into this because I don't want
28:12 to be one of those people because I
28:16 think you can get addicted to telling
28:18 stories you know fictional ones right
28:22 but Tibetan monks for years of very
28:27 quietly well you know again they do not
28:31 run around telling people what they can
28:33 do that's the other cool thing about
28:34 them they go up to a temple and they
28:37 devote their entire life they go
28:39 Sullivant they go quiet they go through
28:43 all kinds of levels of ascension maybe
28:45 an 85 years old you started getting
28:47 to the top of that pyramid of Ascension
28:49 that they have crafted and believed in
28:53 now we haven't had a tibetan superman
28:56 flyer on the world and fix everything so
28:59 perhaps there are limitations there
29:01 perhaps perhaps they believe in a
29:03 philosophy of non-intervention I don't
29:05 know I've never been to one but I had a
29:09 I think he was a roadie back in the 70s
29:14 and he had been on some well they had
29:19 toured the band that they ran I forgot
29:22 who it was a fairly famous band I want
29:25 to say Rolling Stones but I'm not quite
29:26 sure but he was in the area of China or
29:32 wherever this was happening and he said
29:35 that he was on a hiking mission and he
29:39 got injured and so they were so far away
29:44 from society that they're gonna need to
29:46 fix him right away and for whatever
29:49 reason whatever they had on them wasn't
29:51 gonna do it
29:51 and so they helped him up these temple
29:59 stairs you know sort of those Ace
30:00 Ventura part two stairs he gets up to a
30:04 temple and they tell everybody through
30:07 translators say this guy's heard he
30:09 needs to get fixed up he's got an
30:11 infection potentially and the the head
30:16 guru guy up there wasn't an Indian guru
30:18 but his head monk said well the
30:23 assistance you need is in that temple
30:25 over there he points across the chasm of
30:29 this mountainous region and there's
30:32 another temple over there with its own
30:35 set of stairs and what it means is
30:36 they're gonna have to go my buddy is
30:39 gonna have to go all the way down the
30:40 stairs if they just went up and then go
30:42 up a whole nother flight of stairs on
30:44 the other side and so they start but the
30:50 people in the temple and these are the
30:52 people a temple set up will meet you
30:53 there and so he's expecting them to come
30:56 down the stairs but they don't start
30:59 going down the stairs they don't even
31:00 start packing up
31:01 and at one point someone asked in front
31:04 of my friend you know are you going to
31:06 help us get there I mean they're gonna
31:07 walk down with us or whatever and they
31:09 said no no we'll just meet you there so
31:12 they'd go down immediately come up
31:14 immediately they just non-stop a whole
31:16 day's trip a half day or whatever it
31:19 took and they get there and the dude
31:21 that they talk to in the first temple is
31:23 in the second temple it's a chasm as it
31:27 was described like a gorge no wires no
31:33 gondolas going back and forth between
31:35 the two and they get up there and
31:38 they're like how the hell are you here
31:40 before us we never stopped and you never
31:42 started and they kept getting ignored as
31:47 they posed the question the the
31:49 english-speaking people it seemed like
31:52 the natives as he told the story kind of
31:54 knew what happened quote-unquote it's
31:59 all just a claim but it's very
32:01 interesting but this guy was you know
32:05 telling this story in a very astonished
32:08 way let's just split that way he said
32:10 eventually after getting fixed up on the
32:16 way out he really pushed on one of the
32:18 local people and he's like what is going
32:21 on here how did they get up here and he
32:24 says well they just have methods of
32:26 moving from place to place without
32:27 walking essentially saying like a
32:31 spiritual teleportation from one place
32:33 to another and that's the benefit that
32:35 they have for meditating for 50 years up
32:39 here they get these powers they get
32:40 these abilities you know if you hear
32:45 that out of a book you hear that on
32:46 television it's one thing to hear it
32:48 from someone who's supposedly one degree
32:50 away from the event I will tell you it's
32:53 pretty compelling
32:56 my first question after the story was do
32:59 you have other stories like this tell me
33:01 another story and I thought if the guy
33:02 had a story right away then I would
33:07 think oh you're one of those people you
33:09 know
33:11 there were no other stories but you'll
33:15 hear these stories and you personally
33:18 can't confirm them and so it gets
33:19 frustrating right you just want someone
33:23 answer the question is this possible
33:25 right
33:26 there's all these experiments that you
33:28 see from especially the 70s between the
33:30 Russians in the US where they supposedly
33:32 capture people that actually have
33:34 telekinetic powers and then you have the
33:38 skeptics society shows up and debunks a
33:40 bunch of them and some of these folks
33:43 are unbelievable at their hoaxes right
33:47 one of the most brilliant ones I saw was
33:50 on that's incredible I think which was a
33:51 guy who could move the paper on a
33:56 telephone book he could turn the pages
33:58 with his mind is the way he claimed it
34:00 but what he was doing was he would
34:04 exhale and a beautiful perfect stream
34:08 and kneel down to the book at the same
34:10 exact time so he created this wind out
34:12 of his body to just catch a page on the
34:14 book and turn it brilliant
34:17 utterly brilliant but I have seen videos
34:20 where there are pin balls at least what
34:23 appears to be like a pin ball on a table
34:28 and a guy has got his hands sort of in a
34:31 triangle mode and he is got the pin ball
34:35 in the center of his fingers you know
34:37 like the old Jay Z I'm so on the right
34:40 side of humanity pose don't you see him
34:43 moving this ball on a table
34:46 everyone thinks okay somehow you got a
34:48 magnet on your knee or some [ __ ] you are
34:51 moving this by some trickery but there
34:56 are there are all these prizes that have
34:58 been offered for the proving of being
35:01 psychic the proving of telekinetic
35:04 powers and to my knowledge the skeptic
35:07 Society has absolutely never had to pay
35:09 anyone any money some people are just
35:13 rich enough to say I would pay you a
35:16 million dollars of my own hard earned
35:18 money just to see an illusion become
35:22 real you know
35:23 in the book holographic universe that
35:27 was a very interesting story which I
35:30 covered in my episode on that book but
35:34 there was a hypnotist that supposedly
35:37 hypnotized a man to believe that his
35:39 daughter didn't exist and then he had
35:45 someone in the room provide a watch with
35:48 an inscription on the back and he had
35:53 the gentleman sit in this chair
35:54 he put the daughter in front of him
35:58 which he couldn't see anymore because he
36:00 was hypnotized and the way the story
36:03 goes again it's just a chapter in a book
36:06 right section in a book that he holds
36:09 this watch behind the daughter so the
36:13 daughters in between him and the watch
36:14 and he says read the inscription on the
36:16 back of this watch the guy leans down
36:18 looks through his daughter through her
36:21 belly and reads the inscription on this
36:24 watch imagine if that was actually a
36:29 true story nobody really knows if it's a
36:31 true story seems like it'd be pretty
36:32 easy to recreate if you had a hypnotist
36:35 that someone is easily hypnotized
36:36 doesn't matter if they can see through
36:39 human beings simply because they don't
36:40 think the human being exists whoa whoa
36:45 that is huge right imagine you could
36:49 weaponize that if you could somehow
36:52 hypnotize people with beams of energy
36:57 seems like we know a few things that can
36:59 actually do that right so what would
37:02 mind over matter really mean what are we
37:06 one from this idea if we want anything
37:08 at all I think one of the core questions
37:13 that we have to ask is do we really want
37:15 to be in a deterministic universe at all
37:20 like forget mind over matter for a
37:22 second did we want to live in a universe
37:25 where God has everything written down in
37:26 a book and that we just live this sort
37:30 of script you're singing a song with
37:33 lyrics and notes and you know it can't
37:36 be any different because
37:37 this is just the way the song is sung I
37:41 think most of us don't want to be in
37:43 that world right so what would make you
37:47 think that you'd want to live in a world
37:50 where you determined absolutely
37:52 everything and what if you're not God
37:55 and you can't get everything right and
37:59 you're able to undo something but you
38:01 can't put it back hmm people say all the
38:07 time you know I'd make myself different
38:09 in this particular way but if you found
38:12 out that the way you made yourself
38:14 different I ended up making you I don't
38:17 know unpopular you forget who you really
38:23 were and at some point you regret it and
38:25 you want to put yourself back and say
38:26 your what are you trying to do you're
38:27 trying to look at photographs but maybe
38:30 because you made yourself different you
38:31 change the history of the photographs
38:33 and you can't get an image of who you
38:34 were so you can't put yourself back well
38:37 you can kind of change your hair color
38:38 back but it's not really the hair color
38:40 that you had because you never paid
38:41 attention to who you were before you
38:43 start altering things you change a
38:47 little piece of history or a little
38:49 piece of the now and someone dies as a
38:51 result of your change oh my god but you
38:56 don't know how to handle the the
38:58 reversal of your damage right how many
39:03 of you've lit in the fuse on a bomb
39:05 called a firecracker and that thing
39:08 blows something up well it's pretty easy
39:11 to light the fuse but what wouldn't be
39:13 easy is be to put the window back
39:15 together to put whatever you blew up
39:18 back together so the the noise you may
39:22 or may not hear in the microphone the
39:24 tumbling crushing noises the house that
39:27 was destroyed behind my my house by this
39:30 family is it's that's for 10 months now
39:34 and they are still shoveling the damaged
39:37 pieces and parts into a trash can for
39:41 tomorrow's trash but now are you able to
39:45 do things in this world if you believe
39:47 you can't any genre of anything
39:51 and what happens if you're coaxed by
39:53 friends or you somehow put yourself in a
39:55 situation where you try something you've
40:01 never done before and then you're able
40:03 to do it and all of a sudden now for the
40:07 rest of your life you know you can even
40:10 if it's difficult or it's lucky that you
40:12 were able to do it you still know
40:13 there's a way that you can pull it off
40:15 right if we're to ever get to a point of
40:19 mind over matter even in a small
40:22 influence of your own circle and it may
40:25 be that you simply concentrate on things
40:26 that are positive versus negative
40:29 maybe that's all you want maybe that's
40:31 all you need you're like hey God I don't
40:35 necessarily want to control everything
40:36 but this situation where I don't have a
40:39 job or I don't have a companion in my
40:42 life I need your help
40:45 you know and I'm gonna dial in the
40:48 frequency of my own mind to attract that
40:51 to my life now law of attraction is
40:56 interesting because it is the slow
40:58 version of what we're talking about mine
41:00 over matter is always sort of thought
41:01 about in the brain as this instantaneous
41:04 realization of a conception I want you
41:08 know I want that table to be read in my
41:10 backyard
41:12 instead of green and then BOOM the
41:15 pigment and the paint changes everything
41:17 else stays the same it's aged stays the
41:19 same all those dents and nicks and mess
41:21 ups are still the same but the green is
41:23 red now all right the subject of mind
41:28 over matter really appeals to me because
41:30 it calls out this sort of blind spot in
41:34 our perception of our reality doesn't it
41:37 I mean you don't think you can and
41:41 that's before you even try you're
41:42 certain you can't if I took you to a
41:46 Marine base a naval base sorry I didn't
41:51 say marine but a naval base I pointed an
41:53 aircraft carrier and I say move that
41:56 thing ten feet to the right
41:58 not a teleportation but just moving just
42:02 push it with your brain it'll be fine
42:04 you know the anchors will probably fight
42:07 back and all that kind of stuff but
42:08 slosh it around a little bit with your
42:11 brain one no one ever says that to you
42:14 first and foremost the two even if
42:17 someone did say that to you you'd be
42:19 like what are you crazy what are you
42:22 talking about move this thing it's a
42:25 gigantic I don't know several hundred
42:28 thousand ton thing okay yeah obviously
42:34 we'd have to be careful right what if it
42:37 was just a matter of detoxing your brain
42:39 out of paradigms and all of a sudden
42:41 you're capable of doing things again
42:42 plenty crazy people in the world who
42:46 have not been able to do these things
42:47 people who have taken psychedelic drugs
42:49 and watch their hands melts now they
42:52 believe while they're looking at their
42:53 hand melting especially they don't have
42:55 a guide but that is actually occurring
42:57 but it's not occurring at least it's not
43:01 occurring in our realm and they do come
43:03 back out of that trip their hands fine
43:07 it's okay so again what the negative
43:15 result calls out is the notion that
43:21 there is something in place that seems
43:25 to be much bigger than our consciousness
43:27 because again I feel like if you think
43:30 about all them energy in the universe
43:32 that's holding this place together
43:34 regardless of what you think you're
43:36 seeing there's a lot more of it than us
43:38 right just get in your car and drive
43:40 around just look at mountains and look
43:41 at plants and everything you know man
43:46 creates a lot of stuff on this planet
43:47 it's our tools man but something is
43:51 holding the majority of this place
43:53 together and I'm going to say I don't
43:57 know about you but I feel like I control
43:59 a thimble of any eventuality and mine is
44:03 very at this point of my life primarily
44:06 a cause and effect model right I do
44:10 something I tippity type on my keyboard
44:13 and a screenplay comes out an email gets
44:16 greeted I mix them paint together and I
44:19 put it on a canvas and there's a
44:20 painting so mine is very
44:21 cause-and-effect
44:23 and you know there's a lot of wonderful
44:25 rewards for cause-and-effect models
44:27 right you could make love and have a
44:30 child right I don't think that we have
44:33 these thoughts my question is is are we
44:38 not having the thoughts that we can
44:40 change the universe or control a lot
44:42 more than we control because of organic
44:45 paradigms of trying to become human or
44:50 whatever a living being of any kind or
44:55 is it been genetically programmed in us
44:58 to have these limitations is merely is
45:02 it merely a result of proving to
45:04 ourselves before we lose our more
45:09 celestial form when we're born right
45:12 we've seen to be very psychic when we're
45:14 born and we lose that psychic ability as
45:16 time passes because at some point we do
45:19 need to blend with the majority do we
45:23 prove to ourselves either one of two
45:25 things till we prove to ourselves as a
45:27 child well I really don't want to do
45:30 that I've just came out of the celestial
45:33 realm of existence with God and all my
45:36 relatives and a bunch of other life
45:38 beings and the game is not to mess with
45:42 this universe the game is to endorse
45:45 this universe and so we calm down and we
45:50 accept and we're not regretful maybe
45:55 even someone says we'll look you know
45:57 here's the deal here's the deal okay
45:59 when you're human okay you have this
46:03 proprietary platform called human right
46:07 and you are going to have appendages and
46:10 so many senses that you're gonna be able
46:12 to recognize we're off the bat and we
46:14 put some little secret ones out there
46:15 that if you extend your brain a little
46:17 bit you'll have some potentially other
46:20 abilities like maybe seeing auras or you
46:22 know maybe a little psychic you know
46:23 you'll be able to see the future
46:25 or you'll be able to understand reality
46:27 better than other folks but you know
46:29 overall you're in this vessel and that's
46:33 just the way it is but we put this
46:36 little thing in there this little
46:37 playground for you okay because you did
46:40 just come from the heavenly realm where
46:43 things are much more dynamic and there's
46:48 no constraint of time and there's no
46:51 birth life and death
46:54 there's no three-stage life we put this
46:57 little playground in there and we put an
47:00 imperative on your body so you don't go
47:03 crazy being human that you dream you go
47:07 to bed in your dream and sometimes
47:10 you'll remember it sometimes you won't
47:11 but you're always going to do it without
47:13 you remembered or not and so that's sort
47:18 of how we keep sanity and so again you
47:21 accept it how many times you wake up in
47:24 the morning and you really remember your
47:26 dream and then later you can't remember
47:28 it at all yeah did had this thing I
47:32 thought I was gonna remember it but I
47:33 don't remember it hmm the dreams that I
47:37 think you can really remember are the
47:38 ones that you can cast into this reality
47:42 right but the more nebulous your dream
47:45 is there's less things in this world
47:48 that you can compare things to I dream
47:51 that one of you and I meet and we're at
47:54 a restaurant we go to a softball game we
47:57 chill out at a cigar lounge that's
48:00 outside it's beautiful we have a good
48:04 time and when I wake up I'm like okay I
48:06 have been to a restaurant I have been to
48:09 a smoke lounge I've been to a baseball
48:12 game softball game whatever I've been to
48:14 these things so I can map them to this
48:16 reality and therefore my ability to
48:18 remember that dream is very intact but
48:22 the second that you and I spend time
48:25 just as life forces floating around in
48:28 some infinitely vast void of existence
48:31 and we're having this amazing feeling
48:34 conversation between us and then I wake
48:36 up I'm like I have nothing to
48:38 / that - I can't hang on to it as easily
48:41 with my brain so what if those that
48:46 don't that don't dream quote-unquote are
48:48 actually dreaming but nothing that they
48:51 dream about is mapable to this universe
48:53 so they feel the wonderful completion of
48:57 REM sleep and dream and delta and all
49:00 that good stuff but they simply can't
49:01 remember it because not a single piece
49:03 of it belongs in this universe now one
49:07 of the byproducts of taking this
49:09 conversation from concept to fruition
49:13 and perhaps back is that we like I said
49:20 in my episode way back in season 1 when
49:23 I made the episode called the answer way
49:27 back in episode 1 when I made an episode
49:28 called the answer if we get to the edge
49:34 of this sort of audition to be God right
49:40 which should just be a terrifying
49:42 thought process to be honest
49:49 maybe what we find out through this
49:51 mind-over-matter exercise for the mine
49:53 and studying the butterfly effect that
49:56 might occur studying the overwhelming
49:59 responsibility that one would inherit in
50:02 trying to become God that we essentially
50:06 discover how lucky we are how utterly
50:11 lucky we are that someone else or
50:14 something else is taking care of the
50:15 universe for us and that simply being in
50:20 this human body with other humans as
50:23 frustrated as you might be with their
50:25 decisions in life it's truly the most
50:28 ultimate gift that we could possibly
50:31 ever experience alright I guess I
50:35 shouldn't be so absolute about that but
50:37 the idea is this is one of the coolest
50:39 things you could do because it is real
50:42 you know this there's a great
50:45 correlation between where we are in this
50:47 conversation and the show on HBO called
50:49 Westworld
50:51 for those of you haven't seen it this
50:53 will not spoil anything for you Edie
50:57 Harris plays the character dressed all
51:01 in black and the entire show we're now
51:07 in season two the episode five just
51:09 aired last night he is looking for a
51:14 game and the gist of it's very simple
51:20 and this this is where we get to the non
51:22 spoiler 100% this world is for those
51:27 you've never seen this show it's about
51:28 human beings that have created an
51:29 amusement park that has essentially
51:31 robots they call hosts and they have a
51:34 Western world and you can go and be in a
51:38 western movie basically but you as a
51:43 human who is considered a guest of this
51:45 cannot be murdered by a host but you can
51:49 do anything you want to a host you can
51:50 have sex with them you can kill them
51:51 whatever
51:52 ed Harris reveals very quickly in the
51:55 first episode that he has been going to
51:57 this place for thirty years
52:00 and he is sort of done with this God
52:07 mode to the video game where there's
52:11 never any ramifications for anything he
52:12 does he's never really in threat he's
52:15 played out every single scenario the
52:17 writers can come up with and even if
52:18 they come up with a new narrative it's
52:22 just a spin on the ones before and so he
52:28 knows that there is a place that he can
52:34 go somewhere in the park or something's
52:36 gonna happen or something he's so kind
52:37 of confusing you know where it gets real
52:41 he could die if he shot by a host you
52:44 could die because the host could stab
52:46 him in the gut or cut his throat or
52:48 whatever and he is in his elderly age
52:53 he's not in his 70s or 80s in this but
52:56 he's definitely at a point where I want
52:59 something real I've had everything in
53:01 life you hurt me you learn he's a very
53:02 rich man as well anyone can go to this
53:04 park is very very wealthy I'll let you
53:06 figure out everything else by watching
53:07 the show but he has reached a point
53:09 where he's sitting there saying look
53:11 even if I die playing this other side of
53:16 the game if I can find it
53:18 that's better than being what I am today
53:23 let me tell you a season two just rocks
53:26 to this storyline not a level that's
53:29 amazing but if that's us in a way what I
53:34 think they're doing with Westworld and
53:36 the themes that they are acting out in
53:38 West world is nothing shy of absolutely
53:42 brilliant and they are also playing with
53:45 the notion of what is artificial
53:47 intelligence really mean to us so you
53:53 know a great story a great fictional
53:55 story will make you look inside yourself
53:58 deeper and deeper and deeper and again
54:00 television shows are the best way to
54:02 tell stories because you get hours and
54:05 hours and hours there's ten episodes to
54:09 every season of Westworld which means
54:11 they have told
54:13 ten hours in the first season in five
54:16 hours in the second season already
54:17 so 15 hours that would be about 14 12 to
54:24 14 deep thoughts except it's much more
54:28 entertaining of course if you're very
54:31 observant that show will really get you
54:37 to ask yourself some very fundamental
54:39 questions about what is reality what is
54:42 life what is intelligent life and what
54:46 are you doing with your life today and
54:48 the real world non on HBO series what
54:51 are you doing why are you doing it what
54:54 matters what doesn't matter one of the
54:58 caveats to waking up is you know to all
55:03 the untruths of the world is to reassess
55:07 your purpose for living one of the
55:10 themes that comes with that is gaining
55:11 control over your mind getting control
55:13 of your reality right so mind over
55:19 matter conversations tend to go to a
55:21 point where you're saying well geez
55:23 let's just get ultimate control complete
55:25 control over our world over your
55:28 particular world yours
55:29 specifically once you find out there are
55:34 certain individuals in this world that
55:35 have been very evil you know it's very
55:38 common to want to sort of wish them away
55:40 wish them into the cornfield right get
55:42 rid of them maybe in some short
55:46 constraint implementation of that idea
55:48 you would make the world a better place
55:50 for a little while until perhaps
55:53 opportunity breeds greed and breeds
55:55 corruption absolute right turns into
55:58 power
55:59 we know that teaching history is
56:01 important because if we don't then we
56:04 repeat it all the cause-and-effect
56:06 models that have hurt us
56:08 wouldn't it be a gift from God to live
56:11 in a world where you feel comfortable
56:12 being who you are that you're completely
56:16 comfortable and that everything that
56:18 you're experiencing both what you might
56:20 consider to be positive and negative
56:23 turns out to be positive
56:26 more than just a positive but a complete
56:28 euphoric experience so I think you feel
56:31 me if you have been to deep thoughts
56:34 radio.com please go there's video audio
56:36 lock facebook group and patreon
56:39 hopefully this was a useful conversation
56:41 let's compare notes please post in the
56:44 comments section appreciate all your
56:46 views are we living the dream right now
56:50 take care of yourself at someone else
56:52 and I'll see in the next deep thoughts
56:54 over now
