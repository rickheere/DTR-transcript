00:29 welcome back ladies and gentlemen that's
00:34 funny I just noticed I got the camera in
00:35 the old position my friend Carla came
00:38 over and she was like I want to see the
00:41 can I said what bathrooms right there
00:44 sure though I want to see the can the
00:45 can it's in the backyard during all your
00:47 episodes oh yeah she goes they're still
00:50 here
00:50 unless it sure is see I can even make a
00:55 can famous tell you what well as we come
00:59 to an end of season five here one I can
01:04 t believe have been able to pick up five
01:08 hundred and twenty thirty episodes I'm
01:13 not to my own heart because I know some
01:14 of them are marginally entertaining you
01:18 know so I do think about what shows I'm
01:21 doing and it's not typically well let's
01:26 put this way the way David Bowie wrote
01:28 music is how I attempt to make these
01:31 episodes which is you don't just make
01:34 filler ever ever ever ever it's best to
01:39 be silent than to make crap right so I'm
01:42 gonna be obviously continuing to make
01:45 little summer bonus episodes well I try
01:49 to come up with a brand for season six
01:52 but I think the episode we're about to
01:54 do here which you already know the title
01:56 of is very very important our debating
02:01 of whether or not calling it fake bully
02:03 science or bully science we have
02:06 discussed this subject matter before a
02:09 long time ago and I think it was in my
02:13 pop science episode but in the pop
02:16 science episode the goal was to discuss
02:19 which science specifically I don't agree
02:23 with that I think the most brilliant
02:25 minds in the world both past and present
02:30 absolutely categorically don't agree
02:32 with there's a weird thing
02:37 in America at least and I don't know if
02:40 this exists in any other place to be
02:44 honest I don't know if I've ever looked
02:46 at a video and seen it in America we
02:53 sort of have your folks that were I mean
02:59 everyone's raised weird nowadays so it's
03:01 not like one groups raised well on one
03:03 group isn't raised well because there's
03:05 bad groups bad parents and good parents
03:07 on both sides I think it has to do with
03:15 whether or not you feel like you fit in
03:20 classically throughout history
03:22 individuals that feel like they didn't
03:24 fit in which is mainly in their mind
03:26 most the time they don't think they have
03:30 well they don't believe that they are as
03:32 valued as someone as much as someone
03:36 else it's all in their head they may
03:40 even suspect that they have an amassed
03:41 enough knowledge and use and utility for
03:44 society to be of value to the world and
03:56 so it's like it's all in their head it's
03:58 all right when we say someone is made
04:02 equal we mean it right because I hung
04:06 out on both sides of the fence I was a
04:09 science geek computer geek you know but
04:12 I was also pretty good sports up to my
04:17 interest that eventually started waning
04:20 it was really the coaches the coaches
04:22 eventually just made me lose interest in
04:25 high school because they were dudes with
04:28 pent-up issues man it's like [ __ ] dude
04:31 you need to go beat something up she
04:35 will fight each other in a bar get out
04:37 your system then come to coach us right
04:38 they never taught you anything they just
04:40 yell at you it's really stupid at least
04:43 in my school during my grade
04:47 but I would get with kids that kind of
04:52 didn't know they were a little bit nerdy
04:54 and they were great they were just so
04:57 excited they were different right and I
05:00 was different in a way like them I
05:02 wouldn't maybe take it to eleven like
05:04 they did but I could totally listen and
05:07 it was great I am be shutting up as a
05:09 miracle right and so I would learn I
05:12 just absorb and then I went to school
05:16 after school after school and you know
05:19 honestly I went to schools where there
05:21 were no nerds I mean it was interesting
05:23 it was not like everybody was the Fonz
05:26 or something it was just certain was
05:27 kind of middle middle the row thing
05:30 maybe has to do something with post
05:33 puberty or puberty or something like
05:34 that
05:35 by the time I got to high school and
05:38 finally settled down for the last school
05:40 I was gonna go to before graduation
05:43 it definitely was a nice clan of
05:46 brilliant super geeks
05:48 I mean Jays Wow and they had managed to
05:55 so establish themselves in a little town
05:58 that they were little gods you know and
06:02 we loved him that's what I was trying to
06:04 learn as much as I possibly could I
06:06 think I mentioned before one of the
06:08 dudes who was like the top dog he's the
06:12 one that ported Google Earth from
06:14 Windows to Mac senator right on our home
06:18 town when you launched it which I don't
06:20 think happens anymore but anyway came to
06:22 California hold a group of foot people
06:26 all different origins jumped into the
06:30 computer industry the first dudes I
06:33 program with in the TurboTax product
06:35 again I am like the try to count I think
06:39 I'm like v coder for that product but I
06:44 was doing the fonts and the icons and
06:47 all the I finally did the to GS version
06:49 I was making all the tax forms blah blah
06:51 blah I might have been the geekiest guy
06:53 in the entire company because they were
06:54 all surfy guys and it was just great it
06:57 was just in heaven way to the Bay Area
06:59 and now
07:00 all of a sudden I started meeting
07:02 Hillary supporters that very
07:05 overdeveloped sociopathic element to an
07:08 individual some of them were either
07:13 beautiful on or handsome but didn't know
07:15 it and didn't know how to take care of
07:16 themselves and so they always felt
07:18 awkward didn't matter what they look
07:20 like they just acted awkward for
07:24 whatever reason the confidence that one
07:27 gathers through being raised a
07:28 particular way or experiencing life in a
07:31 particular way it would appear that they
07:33 didn't have it except within their skill
07:36 set when I came to programming came to
07:39 something technical you know they were
07:42 like Jimmy Fallon and sudden out live
07:44 move now there is a reason why I'm going
07:48 off on this little tangent here it is
07:51 literally the basis of why I'm doing
07:54 this episode in part there are a lot of
07:58 reasons why people feel disenfranchised
08:00 with the world there's a lot of reasons
08:03 why people turn into sociopaths could be
08:06 sure your appearance that's causing them
08:09 issues and mostly in their mind and you
08:12 know people can look so much different
08:13 than the rest of us that which we're all
08:16 look different too right that they get
08:20 really defensive and then maybe it's
08:27 just you know attracting whatever sex
08:30 they're attracted to that just doesn't
08:32 work out very well they just get more
08:33 and more awkward again I told you one of
08:37 my friends whose father was just not
08:39 around when he was young in his for
08:42 whatever reason his mom was a wonderful
08:43 woman is a wonderful woman but he broke
08:47 down one night was very honest with me
08:48 that he was like how do I get girls it
08:55 was like shortly after we talked
08:56 probably have no no major contribution
09:02 on my end he was he was ballin it was
09:05 amazing but this is about bully science
09:08 what the hell am I talking about I'm
09:10 going off on this well it goes like this
09:13 I have noticed that the more
09:16 disenfranchised someone is the more
09:19 alienated they seem to appear and behave
09:22 and even blatantly discuss with me
09:26 they are very prone to pseudoscience and
09:33 what's so strange is is it's almost as
09:36 if real science and real thought process
09:39 of logic and counter logic and deducing
09:44 and connecting and cross-referencing
09:47 it's just not a skill they have and so
09:51 they take that packaged up worry and
09:55 they go for it right off you heard about
09:59 climate change climate change climate uh
10:00 you know and here's the mechanism I want
10:05 to highlight before the year goes too
10:07 much further because these are tools
10:09 that you can use to defend yourself
10:11 against a absorption of bad ideas like
10:15 if somebody says that crafty enough
10:17 eventually your brains just gonna go
10:19 well maybe we are wrong and let's have
10:21 carbon taxation and agenda21 real
10:24 depopulation and that's like all of
10:30 that's just like slitting your own
10:31 throat I mean you know you side with him
10:34 just [ __ ] find a high place and jump
10:37 off already save them the bill save
10:40 yourself the anxiety of finally finding
10:42 out you sold out your whole [ __ ]
10:44 species to these George Soros rotschild
10:48 douchebags right but now when you feel
10:50 disenfranchised what what is one of the
10:52 mechanisms that you feel you feel as if
10:57 no matter what you say no one cares you
11:00 could even be saying something profound
11:02 you know you know I perform a
11:05 tracheotomy save someone's life in an
11:07 airport and they just want you to listen
11:08 to you and so we all need to be relevant
11:17 in this world we do and it's a very
11:20 interesting thing because you know
11:22 freedom desiring freedom is like number
11:25 one and being relevant
11:27 I think is number two because those two
11:32 things will get the ultimate goal which
11:36 is being well having a platform and a
11:39 paradigm to be loved I guess there's
11:45 some sweet lovin and cruising too but
11:47 sure is a lot better when you pick your
11:49 partner right everything we do is to get
11:52 you know higher up on the totem as they
11:57 would say what they want to do by
12:01 throwing these alarmist because here's
12:04 the interesting thing everything that
12:07 they're interested in scientifically in
12:09 huge flying quotes is a tragedy it's a
12:13 tragedy and one you're responsible for
12:17 the tragedy they aren't and two just
12:21 like the same formula of every goddamn
12:23 religion on planet earth they're the
12:25 preacher they're the new pseudoscience
12:28 preacher he was going to tell you what
12:32 you're gonna have to do to solve the
12:35 goddamn problem that you created that
12:37 you maintain their pure green because
12:42 what they really want is a sense of
12:45 relevance and then they want something
12:48 they've never ever had at least through
12:51 perception but probably haven't because
12:53 most of us shouldn't want to do what
12:56 they tried to do which is to commandeer
12:58 in control you that's what a preacher
13:02 does comes to your door back in the old
13:05 days the Catholic priests priests
13:07 especially when you come to my house in
13:09 Kansas he'd ring the doorbell and here's
13:13 the here's his his thought process is
13:16 very simple I've never seen you in
13:18 church so you're a goddamn Center
13:20 because there's like one Catholic Church
13:22 in this whole town
13:23 oh there's twenty other churches in this
13:25 town but I've got the only way to God
13:27 right because what Michelangelo made a
13:30 painting of Jesus giving the Pope a key
13:32 and that's that's fact that actually
13:37 occurred and so now the guy would always
13:39 be looking at me through the screen
13:41 this guy a couple times we had the most
13:43 sarcastic scornful guilt-tripping look
13:48 in front of me and I think it surprised
13:53 him that I treated him with respect and
13:56 eventually gave me this super cool
13:59 picture of Jesus it was just cool it was
14:04 the one where his heart is glowing and
14:06 the center of his chest you know it's
14:08 like um I think it was a real
14:09 anatomically correct heart to just like
14:11 so bizarre I mean a metaphor you could
14:14 just do a pull Valentine's Day heart
14:17 probably just say jesus loves you on the
14:20 candy or something I'm just cool I put
14:23 it up my bedroom put it right next to my
14:25 my monitor was here leaned up against
14:28 the wall there it was cool but I have
14:32 friends that I love dearly and I will
14:35 still love them forever but they do this
14:40 because they have done it so many times
14:42 and they have brainwashed themselves
14:46 sometimes you get a little bit of that
14:48 salt and pepper of uh-oh
14:51 let me tell you what's what's real men
14:54 and I have yet to meet one of these
14:58 alarmists that knows a ton about what
15:04 they repeat because they don't get
15:10 briefed with any level of detail about
15:13 what the what they're talking about
15:15 case in point the the buoys that are out
15:18 there in the ocean supposedly measuring
15:20 the heat of the water down below they're
15:25 all subsidized and paid for and created
15:27 by the deep state there is no company
15:31 that could monetize that data so it has
15:34 to be a government entity a friend of
15:37 mine got in her car today caught me on
15:39 her cell phone and we were talking about
15:41 swarm Mountain City was about 83 degrees
15:44 tops I was out here on this patio it was
15:47 awesome right now it's like probably
15:50 68 69 70 something like that okay so she
15:55 says oh it's funny I got on my car she
15:56 owns a Fiat and she said my car my car
16:02 says it's a hundred and five outside
16:05 because these social engineers screwed
16:08 around with the thermometer and put it
16:10 in a place in the car where it's
16:12 literally overheating 20 plus degrees to
16:16 give the illusion that you're really hot
16:18 20 plus degrees could you imagine then
16:21 imagine being in a hot tub and it's a
16:23 hundred degrees and then in a split
16:25 second it goes to 120 you've got a few
16:29 seconds to get out of thing before you
16:30 start to burn first degree burns and
16:33 probably collapse with heat exhaustion
16:35 but you're having this conversation with
16:38 someone you're just bouncing around
16:39 conversations and then all of a sudden
16:43 they hit that point where they're like
16:45 oh my god you don't believe something I
16:47 believe and it's one of these things and
16:49 so they they just changed the the the
16:53 static electricity in the room from a
16:57 super positive frequency to a low
16:59 vibration pseudo-science frequency plus
17:04 guilt again they're always innocent
17:08 that's the funny thing they're always a
17:10 hundred percent innocent of anything if
17:13 they are truly and what they're which
17:15 they're not great but in their brain I'm
17:17 doing everything I possibly can wait for
17:19 the carbon footprint you know Tesla it
17:22 gets power from nowhere now as I say
17:26 these things please understand every
17:30 single way that we generate electricity
17:31 in America is a shitty way of doing it
17:34 hydroelectric is the way to go wave
17:37 machines off the coast that you don't
17:39 even see geothermal built properly as
17:45 Caltech initially designed it with
17:47 closed pipe systems and our open pipe
17:49 systems there's a million ways to do it
17:54 using nature I don't think cars should
17:58 run on oil
17:58 I think they should run off staiin Myers
18:02 water fracturing in
18:04 so I'm not for a bunch of the stuff but
18:08 some of this science is simply insane
18:10 the climate does what the climate does
18:13 now if we could get these planes to stop
18:14 controlling weather get a harp antenna
18:17 stop punching like circles inside you
18:20 know cloud formations that'd be nice
18:22 wouldn't it if we could get countries
18:26 like China to stop destroying the bottom
18:28 of the Pacific Ocean the Fukushima well
18:34 that if that really happened it's truly
18:36 an accident you know but I think that we
18:41 should rethink some of that technology
18:45 but the bully factor is so ironic
18:49 because you know some kids are bullied
18:52 and it just blows my mind that this
18:55 stuff still exists because man I went to
18:58 a lot of schools and I was a kid and the
19:01 second a bully showed up with one
19:04 exception because the kid was mentally
19:06 not stable everybody would just I mean
19:10 the dudes would just I mean they barely
19:12 ever happened right you would hear about
19:14 maybe one thing but everyone would go
19:17 kick the guy's ass I mean three or four
19:18 of us would get together and go chase
19:20 the guy down it's like when I became a
19:22 lifeguard I finally saw quite a bit of
19:25 this you know playful water things or
19:26 big kids are trying to pick on little
19:28 kids and so you see a little bit of that
19:30 and to you it's nothing right you're I'm
19:33 like you know 16 17 years old yelling
19:38 out a 14 year old it's like but to the
19:40 to the little eight-year-old nine year
19:42 old it's like to them it's it's a
19:44 traumatic situation they don't know the
19:48 parameters of their safety so they think
19:50 they're gonna die just because the
19:52 rubber ball hits them in the head but
19:54 some people get really bullied I mean
19:56 beat up the [ __ ] stolen
20:01 and so those kids might be some of the
20:03 people that grow up into this
20:05 I think they turn into the boy called
20:07 Sue and they get a little stronger you
20:09 know it's an unfortunate way to do it
20:11 but it's um we're trying to get specific
20:19 but I'm also trying to get a nonsense of
20:21 because I don't want to you know hurt
20:24 anybody's feelings in this world but
20:25 some folks have lived really crappy
20:28 childhoods and so where do we talk about
20:34 the other day
20:34 they're the loser and the person beating
20:37 them up is the winner so sometimes when
20:40 they grew up and have kids they beat
20:41 their kids since now they're the winner
20:43 and the kids are the losers they get to
20:44 have that other feeling Big Brothers and
20:47 Big Sisters have known to do that to
20:49 their little brothers and little sisters
20:50 part of its hazing for a life you know
20:53 like my Italian friends taught me that
20:57 they for the boys I don't know what they
21:00 do with the girls side but for the boys
21:01 so they smack you around constantly it's
21:04 with love kind of it's with a lot of
21:06 love actually and but you know kind of
21:10 get you ready for bad neighborhoods
21:12 tough life life doesn't care if you live
21:14 or die it just doesn't it just is it's
21:16 indignant and or I should say I'm
21:19 ambivalent to the whole thing so if
21:22 you're in a conversation just for the
21:24 general archetype watch for this because
21:27 it's fascinating it's utterly
21:28 fascinating one you know the
21:32 psychological one is it's sort of like
21:36 someone taking a proverbial gun out of
21:39 the intellectual pocket and pointing it
21:41 at your face and saying you're one of
21:44 those people I'm gonna threaten you now
21:47 and you got to do what I say you know
21:49 okay all right what do we have to
21:51 believe here mr. mr. and mrs. thought
21:54 police so if you didn't if they didn't
21:58 have control when they were kids they
22:00 definitely want control when they're
22:01 adults and it becomes this beautiful
22:02 thing the other one is to know enough
22:05 information to be dangerous now we all
22:08 fall in that camp a little bit but
22:11 what's really interesting about it is
22:13 I've heard these defense mechanisms and
22:15 I've mentioned them many many years ago
22:17 but for instance when you know I
22:20 probably spent let's see one you know I
22:25 mean most of you know I've got a pretty
22:26 good background in physics but when 9/11
22:29 came around you had architects of
22:32 engineers for 9/11 truth which still
22:34 functioning to this day and they
22:36 explained the relevant physics that you
22:39 need to understand about objects falling
22:41 down you know a banana splitting
22:44 building and so you didn't have to have
22:48 a PhD to understand basic physics
22:51 because then you know all of it comes
22:52 back to you it's like riding a bike
22:54 again the first thing we learned in
22:56 physics in my high school was you had a
22:59 beam of Steel of a certain strength
23:04 density width height and all that kind
23:06 of stuff
23:07 supported between two pylons and then
23:09 they put weight on it and they wanted to
23:11 see how much it would naturally Bend
23:12 without any weight thing with weight and
23:14 what would be the breaking point of the
23:16 beam where you would literally
23:19 accelerate the particle so much that
23:21 they would heat up into a molten state
23:25 for a split second and so I was at this
23:29 party with a very very good friend of
23:30 mine very famous guy in Hollywood and he
23:37 like he and I were like best buds so we
23:40 still are to this day and I'm just you
23:44 know chilling out and he comes and grabs
23:46 me he says he gotta come over here and
23:48 he takes me over to like four guys
23:50 sitting on a three sitting on a little
23:52 loveseat and then one dude sitting off
23:54 left and most of these folks are
23:55 directors or some participation in
23:58 Hollywood today some of them are retired
24:02 pretty young though and two of them were
24:05 like at least I mean I think two of them
24:09 were former NSA which is interesting so
24:11 very loyal very patriotic and so you're
24:14 not fighting facts anymore you're
24:16 fighting patriotism
24:17 you know moon-landing defense barrier
24:20 stuff right but what you'll get all the
24:23 time from certain folks is I start
24:27 mention
24:27 all this stuff about nyla cuz he says
24:29 they're talking about 911 you gotta sit
24:30 down and just tell him what you know get
24:32 the conversation like okay so I sit down
24:34 I think I was sitting on the floor and
24:39 they'd never seen me before and so I
24:44 start mentioning some of the stuff and
24:45 one you know two or three of the guys
24:47 like yeah that's what I heard too and
24:48 you know it makes all it makes a lot of
24:49 sense so it's been peer reviewed kind of
24:53 in the group but there's one dude who
24:54 doesn't want to believe it he's the
24:55 biggest NSA dude and his defense
24:58 mechanism was to say well do you have a
25:01 degree in structural engineering Emily
25:05 oh we're gonna go there huh I said no
25:08 but I've spent the last probably at the
25:11 time about four or five years rehashing
25:15 all my physics learning about all these
25:18 stuff learning about all the deception
25:20 from NIST from FEMA Purdue University
25:23 creating shitty simulations negating
25:26 most of the structural pylons in the
25:29 Pentagon and creating a pancake scenario
25:32 where they had 30 floors stacked on top
25:34 of each other but in real life there
25:35 were not 30 floors you know like when it
25:38 all fell down popular science magazine
25:42 lying I mean just tons of it right so
25:46 you will get that defense if you tried
25:50 to defend it with facts they can pull
25:53 that little trump card out and you have
25:55 to be willing you know an able to
25:58 describe while your information is still
26:00 relevant prediction models are a
26:03 mechanism of theirs right Al Gore's
26:07 reverse hockey stick I don't know what
26:09 they call reverse but you know his is
26:13 the movie Inconvenient lie right
26:16 December 2006 he has this thing where
26:20 he's showing you this accelerated
26:21 exponential curve that is so steep by
26:25 2010 he had to go around the back of his
26:28 movie screen and he had to flip up like
26:31 a cardboard thing up or something so
26:34 that you could see the rest of the curve
26:35 because it went off the screen again
26:38 montecito was gonna be underwater he
26:40 owns a house and lives there
26:41 no nothing's risen jack-shit
26:44 everything that's happened to the
26:46 environments in zagreb made his movie is
26:48 completely natural cycles of the earth
26:51 they said it was gonna get really hot
26:53 they call it global warming well then
26:55 they realize we're in the phase of the
26:57 mini ice age and so they now call
26:59 climate change which means they get to
27:01 take advantage of all things that happen
27:02 it's all those tornados it just happened
27:05 in the Midwest it's a whole climate
27:06 change climate change no Kim trails I've
27:10 been now tracked changing the weather
27:12 period China changed their weather for
27:15 the Olympics people do it all the time
27:20 but what's fascinating is at least with
27:24 some of my friends they will have just
27:27 sort of the highlights of the theories
27:29 and then what they do in their brain
27:32 because all they're they're not really
27:34 interested in as well I should put this
27:38 way they're definitely interested in
27:39 making the world a better place like
27:41 almost every human being on planet Earth
27:42 is except for a few douchebags that try
27:44 to get you vaccinated right so we're
27:47 kind of all in this together trying to
27:48 create the same environment but when you
27:51 punch into their data and you like
27:56 they'll bring some data to you and
27:58 you'll go do you know who that guy is
28:00 well kinda yeah well you know he works
28:03 for you know I guess you know George
28:04 Soros is uh no I never heard of that guy
28:06 then you better be really quiet from
28:09 this point forward because you you know
28:12 ironically with a giant pun they've only
28:16 touched the tip of the iceberg of the
28:18 truth of the situation they don't know
28:20 about carbon taxation they don't know
28:22 how it's gonna work they don't know
28:24 about agenda21
28:25 they don't know about the Georgia
28:26 Guidestones you know anything so they
28:29 come to you with a pixel of a 4k screen
28:32 and they're telling you that they know
28:34 what the picture is no they don't I'm
28:39 yet to meet someone who schools [ __ ] out
28:42 of me on this stuff I mean it would
28:44 actually be kind of nice you know not
28:46 the I'm going to try to size you up to
28:48 see if you got a PhD in this and that is
28:50 if you need ph d--'s for certain things
28:52 you don't you
28:54 I'm a car mechanic either but I can
28:56 change a flat tire you know I could
28:59 probably get anything done on my car
29:01 I've changed my power steering engine
29:04 motor in 15 minutes taking pictures just
29:09 because I read a forum online I saw the
29:12 pictures online I had to do this
29:13 pictures weren't even that good but I
29:16 went underneath and pulled the power
29:18 steering motor out and tossed it and put
29:20 a new one in
29:21 I took picture it would have been done
29:23 in probably eight minutes that I not
29:24 taken photographs okay did I need a PhD
29:29 for that no don't need to go to some
29:32 trade school to do it no the notion is
29:36 that there's these gigantic tables of
29:38 cause and effect in the world and if you
29:40 don't know the indicative cause and
29:43 effect models then you just can't come
29:47 out comment at all now that's very
29:50 relevant in certain areas and one of the
29:52 biggest areas that's relevant is the
29:54 human body like we know how to take
29:56 vitamins and don't eat too much sugar
29:58 don't drink booze don't do too many
30:00 hardcore drugs and blow out your t-cells
30:02 and then they say you died of AIDS
30:05 we know those basic things but man you
30:10 know how do you cut a human body open
30:12 and start doing surgeries and you know
30:15 how do you take part of a colon out and
30:18 then make the two halves connect
30:19 together and take an artery from a leg
30:21 and put it into the heart I mean that
30:22 stuff is where you need massive skills
30:26 confidence and you just have to be a
30:29 special human being but we don't contest
30:33 those procedures we let those geniuses
30:36 be the geniuses but somehow you know
30:43 temperature think about it
30:46 temperature and I don't wanna get off on
30:49 a particular rant but then they also
30:54 sensationalize things that are just
30:59 absurd comments like one of the
31:04 conspiracies on their end of the game
31:06 which I've only heard one of my friends
31:07 really champion
31:08 this whole thing but this person must
31:10 have read an article or something and
31:12 then took it completely as truth without
31:18 applying like regular logic to it and
31:21 this is the maybe some of you've heard
31:24 this that we're going to run out of
31:26 clean spring water like it's as if the
31:30 whole world's gonna go salt salt water
31:33 oh ok so the process of evaporation is
31:38 basically what you're saying the Sun is
31:40 going to cease to do right because the
31:44 more the world is covered in oceans I
31:47 think we're pretty much at a fixed model
31:49 for any one of our lives right we're not
31:51 gonna gain any new super mass openings
31:54 in the world hopefully and there's no
31:58 gigantic you know 30 you know was it
32:03 Geiger counter earthquake in the Midwest
32:06 or something but someone did this
32:10 graphic online they created a sphere of
32:15 all the natural spring water in the
32:17 world and then they pulled they put it
32:20 next to the surface of the earth then
32:21 they pulled the camera back and of
32:23 course the earth is gigantic next to the
32:25 sphere and they said this is all the
32:27 water we have that's clean from nature
32:30 meaning not salt water due to dying fish
32:34 and feces and stuff in the ocean it's
32:39 amazing how much fish have to die in the
32:43 ocean in order to salt the whole place
32:46 up it's crazy but just like reverse
32:49 osmosis the evaporation process can't
32:53 lift the salt to the sky and so it takes
32:57 just fresh water
32:58 it's called clouds right and it carries
33:01 it into the mainland and it drops it
33:03 just yes people in Seattle ask people in
33:06 Oregon if it rains ask people Hawaii if
33:09 it rains it rains everywhere
33:13 and so the stuff gets trapped goes into
33:17 the mantle of the earth we have wells
33:20 and all kinds of stuff and we
33:22 drink it and use it it's an everlasting
33:26 process singing with oil right so I've
33:30 been thinkin you know like what is a
33:33 response when you really want to sort of
33:36 address the issue that's going on but
33:37 you don't want to lose a friend and you
33:39 know if you love your friends you would
33:40 never want to hurt their feelings that
33:44 if your friends gonna continue talking
33:45 like this every time you get together
33:48 and luckily my friends are so far not
33:51 like that we mentioned you know but we
33:56 don't argue about it we just know we
33:57 don't agree but if you had to bring it
34:00 up and you know you could take the
34:03 attitude of like don't do that and
34:05 they're like don't do what don't try to
34:06 take control over me with your
34:08 fear-mongering science right your bully
34:11 pseudoscience oh now you're confronting
34:15 them you're also taking away from them
34:18 at that moment their dignity we're
34:23 taking away their pseudo control
34:25 mechanism that works with all their
34:28 other sheepish friends because what if
34:31 you get to these people together oh my
34:33 god why they don't just commit suicide I
34:35 don't know the world's overpopulated oh
34:37 yes and then all this other stuff it's
34:39 like wait don't you guys make a pact go
34:42 out in the woods and remove to off the
34:44 planet right but they never do
34:47 right bill gates talking about deep
34:50 populating the world way dude I could
34:53 think of a fake computer scientist that
34:58 it's flapping his mouth right now they
35:00 could be the first one to go so how do
35:04 you reply I think one of the things you
35:07 could say is I really admire your
35:13 dedication to making the world a better
35:16 place I truly admire that don't change
35:20 always look to make things better now
35:25 you know that and whether or not you
35:27 have a friend of one kind or another
35:29 kind whether or not you could possibly
35:32 get them to go down a rabbit hole with
35:35 you that you
35:36 been done this is why it's fun to learn
35:38 all conspiracies of all kinds so that
35:41 you can dialogue about them
35:43 intelligently deeply I mean imagine
35:46 someone brings up Planet X theory to you
35:48 on the conspiracy side one of us
35:51 someone's really hot on that thinks
35:53 they're seeing two sons and they're
35:56 usually seeing atmospheric effects of
35:58 the ocean or something
36:00 almost all the footage I've ever seen of
36:02 more than one son is shooting right over
36:04 the ocean at the sunset at least where I
36:08 am because the Sun that ways land and
36:11 that ways the sunset in its ocean but it
36:15 would be good to know like if I said you
36:18 know you do you know the Planet X theory
36:20 oh yeah totally man what is it well I
36:22 just know that there's this planet
36:24 that's gonna come by and a bunch of
36:25 meteorites are gonna hit Earth and when
36:27 the president's gonna go into a bunker
36:29 and like that's gonna help seriously
36:33 there's no science to that whatsoever I
36:35 mean a meteorite come on if it's as big
36:38 as a Greyhound bus you're gonna have to
36:40 be like 3 or 4 miles underneath the
36:43 ground to not have an impact crush you
36:46 to death immediately right it may not
36:48 hit you physically but it's gonna
36:50 compress all the rock where you're
36:51 sitting and you're gonna die yeah sure
36:54 maybe you avoid some fallout but the
36:59 story hinges on someone claiming to
37:03 channel an alien consciousness from I
37:07 think planet Nibiru right and that's how
37:10 the whole thing started so they're you
37:12 know the it's like well do you believe
37:14 in channeling maybe even sucker punch
37:17 him you know oh yeah I play next day hey
37:20 let me ask you do you believe in
37:21 channeling what do you mean well you
37:24 know someone talking to another spirit
37:27 from another realm or especially to
37:29 alive people like do you think that you
37:33 could channel another person on the
37:35 other side of the world like I could
37:37 talk to you but they're real I'm really
37:38 talking to this woman on the other side
37:40 of the world in India and you guys could
37:43 talk to each other and then I could talk
37:44 to her do you think you could do that no
37:46 man that's ridiculous why would everyone
37:48 think they could do that
37:50 like oh yeah me too I'm exactly with you
37:52 what's funny because that planet next
37:54 thing uh it comes from a channeling oh
37:58 it does yeah that's where the whole
38:00 theory came from and then they start you
38:03 just didn't just drift off change the
38:04 subject and let them think about it for
38:06 a little while right don't put a
38:07 spotlight on them and undress them the
38:12 whole thing in my brain sort of turns
38:15 into a metaphor of like you go to a
38:24 friend's house let's just say now
38:26 someone you're gonna try to date because
38:27 this wouldn't work if you're gonna try
38:29 to date them
38:29 did you go to your friend's house and
38:32 let's just say that they have dealt with
38:34 some traumatic situation that has
38:37 changed them temporarily while they go
38:39 through the traumatic situation they've
38:41 lost a friend a family member their job
38:44 whatever and because of they're under
38:47 this massive duress they they haven't
38:54 cleaned up their house in a really long
38:56 time so you go over there and it was
38:57 clean last time you were there and hey
39:00 you go inside no no [ __ ] this is bad but
39:03 you got energy they don't you have a
39:05 clear mind you are not suffering at this
39:07 particular moment in time they are and
39:10 so maybe without even asking them you
39:14 just start picking up stuff and moving
39:16 stuff around throwing stuff in the trash
39:19 and you don't make it obvious right
39:20 because then they might get embarrassed
39:21 oh don't worry about that I'll clean it
39:23 up later that's cool man you know
39:26 embarrassing me stop you're embarrassing
39:27 me right so you just kind of do well
39:29 they're not looking and you'd be fixing
39:31 these things this is sort of what we're
39:35 doing with the planet now because of the
39:38 again Mockingbird press these scientists
39:42 I mean think about it one of my little
39:46 hidden fantasies in my mind would be to
39:49 have a show with neil degrasse tyson i
39:51 know what you call it but i think it
39:53 would be a slam dunk show and it would
39:57 be titled something like conspiracy
39:59 versus reality or something like that
40:03 and what it would be is that there be a
40:06 series of subjects that we would be
40:07 discussing on that particular day
40:09 whatever would fill up probably a 22
40:11 minute slot
40:13 well we flip a coin at the very
40:15 beginning to conspiracy coin one sides
40:17 tinfoil hat guy and the other side is
40:20 like a dead president right and
40:23 determines which one of us goes first
40:25 now I'll be the tin hat guy of course
40:26 right but he and I have both prepared
40:30 and PowerPoint with our producers and
40:33 some illustrators and all this
40:34 royalty-free content or content we paid
40:38 for he explains gravity than I explained
40:42 gravity he explains space-time fabric I
40:45 explained ether fabric he explains that
40:49 eleven official story I explained it as
40:51 a conspiracy using my physics rate
40:55 because I could always get this guy to
40:58 utterly collapse because I can explain
41:00 things I think such that anyone can
41:03 understand it on planet Earth from a
41:05 little kid as long as they understand
41:07 English and concepts I can dial down to
41:11 them and feed it to him and this for me
41:16 would be cleaning up the mess that these
41:18 folks have put together here's what's
41:21 interesting about that format that show
41:26 he Neil deGrasse Tyson in this
41:30 particular situation has already got
41:33 everyone on his side in terms of the
41:37 overwhelming majority of the world and
41:39 he has it for two different distinct
41:41 reasons for the very few that would
41:45 attend the show live and for the mini
41:49 that would watch the show in whatever
41:51 format it's on who are educated in the
41:55 science that we might be discussing for
41:57 instance and I'd be prepared for those
41:59 people to of course
42:01 he can just lean on published materials
42:04 peer certified [ __ ] right pop science
42:08 because the colleges are all upside down
42:12 you know teaching gravity is a
42:14 phenomenon
42:16 give me a break what else in life is a
42:20 phenomenon but is true nothing nothing
42:25 is de-facto true with the word
42:28 phenomenon is about what the third or
42:29 fourth word and the definition of
42:31 gravity see how that works the other
42:35 thing he could lean on is his own PhD
42:38 and he could explain things in the
42:44 pseudo science way because science is
42:46 not ignorant it's just many cases wrong
42:52 well how does the format of su of
42:55 science work which allows them to bully
42:58 the rest of the world into it they
43:01 simply tell you a story that you can
43:05 believe in some cases for instance the
43:10 beginning of the universe being the Big
43:12 Bang Theory people love that because
43:14 that takes away the hideous acidic sort
43:20 of logic problem that the universe
43:22 probably simply exists it doesn't have a
43:26 beginning middle and end
43:27 we have beginning middle and ends and so
43:30 our hubris demands that the universe
43:32 follow the same cycle as mankind because
43:36 we see a plant grow when we see a plant
43:38 die and then we see another plant come
43:40 up in its place and we see the cycle we
43:43 see ourselves born into this world and
43:45 then we put our loved ones down it is a
43:49 very undeniable cycle for us until you
43:52 grow up out of that and you realize
43:54 there were infinite beings but then
43:57 there's the patriotic defense mechanism
44:00 like we always talk about people in the
44:02 audience we'd have to do the moon
44:04 missions on one of the episodes right
44:05 probably take up the whole episode he
44:08 goes and I go he might maybe the
44:11 format's he refutes what I put down it'd
44:15 be almost like a court case right I have
44:17 to give him my discovery then he give me
44:19 his discovery no one's to pull out
44:20 anything that wasn't put in Discovery so
44:22 the show goes well or maybe we have a
44:24 big last minute five minute surprise
44:27 battle between each other I bring
44:29 peace information he's not ready for and
44:30 he brings a peace information I'm not
44:32 ready for when we go for it right and
44:35 through the magic of editing we have a
44:37 little bit of time to think about things
44:39 before we respond and it's all cut out
44:41 of the show so moves fluently would make
44:43 us look like uber geniuses but the moon
44:47 missions because we've always discussed
44:50 come with patriotism and you don't want
44:54 to think that man hasn't done something
44:55 right so that's another reason why
45:00 pseudoscience wins the second one is
45:04 straight up fear we don't want to think
45:09 that our country would attack us ever
45:12 ever ever support of its the patriotism
45:14 but the other other part is like even if
45:17 you could get me over that hump someone
45:19 says from the audience there's no way
45:21 that I am prepared to accept super-mega
45:26 evil stuff why is that because the
45:30 audience isn't evil and it's sort of
45:34 this endearing property in people that
45:37 they don't want to think that the world
45:39 is bad and you know then you're kind of
45:41 like yeah I've you've probably done it
45:43 yourself or you're looking at someone
45:45 going and inside your voices saying is
45:48 it really important that we bring one
45:50 more person on to the 9/11 is an inside
45:52 job thing I don't know probably valuable
45:56 if we could get it to happen but for
45:59 every person you're staring at that
46:00 doesn't want to go there they're not
46:03 gonna sleep well if you did convince
46:05 them of this maybe they won't sleep for
46:07 weeks like most of us when we first woke
46:09 up maybe just let it go with a
46:14 particular individual again probably one
46:18 of the most tumultuous decisions a
46:19 parent could make in the 21st century is
46:23 you've got little kids and you're a
46:26 parent and you're obviously protecting
46:28 them from the elements from the evil
46:30 elements of the world bad people bad
46:32 content bad cultural stuff maybe
46:35 homeschooling for many many years and
46:38 you do it not only to make sure they get
46:41 good science
46:42 reading writing arithmetic they get good
46:44 social sciences just everything that's
46:46 the meat and potatoes that we used to
46:49 teach up until about 1985 when I think
46:54 was math became an electorial thing in
46:57 eighth grade when I was a kid I'm 50
47:01 years old man
47:02 that's 1984 no 1983 to 84 it was over
47:11 the PA at my school that math is an
47:14 electorial thing and I was just like
47:15 really so kids barely know any math and
47:20 and they don't know how to balance a
47:21 checkbook and they don't know how to
47:22 make a budget and all that kind of stuff
47:24 and you're gonna leave them hanging all
47:26 right but then you look at your kids and
47:30 you're thinking crap at some point and
47:34 your kids are probably really different
47:36 from each other as well once perhaps
47:38 very edgy and one is like very fragile
47:41 very good no be fine when they grow up
47:43 but for now they're still fragile well
47:46 hell you don't have all your kids on the
47:47 same day and so one of your kids might
47:50 be two to three plus years younger than
47:52 the one you're gonna brief eventually
47:55 right now what would be the total
47:59 fantasy with the deep thoughts
48:01 university is that we create a a
48:03 homeschooling educational curriculum for
48:06 parents that very cleverly inserts the
48:10 relevant Sciences such that when they
48:12 get to theories that are bad they deduce
48:15 it on their own you know what if you
48:19 taught your kids physics I'd like maybe
48:22 nine ten years old you just get them to
48:24 the basics right don't worry about the
48:27 equations as much as the the sort of
48:30 cause and effect reaction and equal and
48:33 opposite reaction stuff so they look at
48:37 things they like well that that requires
48:39 force and you're like you're right and
48:42 you know you could even play stupid if
48:44 they're really I never thought about
48:45 that you know you let your kid totally
48:47 decipher not 11 they're like you know I
48:49 don't know what happened there
48:51 billing seven was definitely imploded
48:53 dad yeah you're right
48:56 very observant how did you come to that
48:58 conclusion well you know look at this
49:00 that this that you can hear the
49:01 explosions can't you yeah you sure can
49:02 can't you
49:03 looks like the Center pylon blew on that
49:06 they remember you taught me about how
49:07 they blow up buildings because it was
49:08 interesting I'm a boy
49:10 yeah I'm sure but I did remember when
49:12 you took me to see a building destroyed
49:15 and you told me how Center pylons are
49:17 blowing out of big buildings I could see
49:20 it right there in the film dad like yeah
49:23 my god you're right and you say the
49:26 magic phrase you go well maybe all those
49:29 architects and engineers are right what
49:31 do you mean too and check out this
49:33 website dip it dip it did you just leave
49:35 it up and the key just goes through it
49:37 and in in two days their utter authority
49:40 on it then their minds are open if you
49:44 teach them what gravity really is we
49:46 hear about the Big Bang and you know
49:48 eventually they go wait a minute if if
49:51 gravity is simply a negative pressure
49:53 between etheral particles which makes
49:57 gravity immediately work and that's what
49:59 you know all the classic scientists who
50:01 discovered electricity relied on to
50:03 invent all of their sciences then
50:07 they're like what would be pushing the
50:08 Big Bang together you know that's a good
50:11 point I think nothing because particle
50:14 do not talk to each other atoms do not
50:18 exchange information with each other
50:20 across the universe perhaps if they're
50:22 engaging in electrical valence yes they
50:25 exchange electrons I told you in the
50:29 first season probably within ten shows
50:32 this show has the Charter and the
50:35 Charter is rebuilding the planet from
50:38 the bottom up meaning us the people who
50:43 are listening to the people from on high
50:46 teaches the pseudoscience things well
50:49 we've got to clear the slate cut all the
50:52 umbilical cords to those folks right if
50:55 you think about it in the metaphor of a
50:57 computer being hacked what's the first
51:01 principle of hacking a computer getting
51:04 access to it well it used to be that
51:07 someone had to break into your house and
51:09 you know
51:09 your computer and go through a password
51:11 barrier and then started searching for
51:13 files needed to put other storage
51:14 devices onto your computer to lift files
51:17 off maybe they took pictures of the
51:19 screen at the worst case scenario in
51:21 today's world it's all Internet people
51:25 walking on to our computers because the
51:28 people create the operating systems have
51:30 installed backdoors they'll let him walk
51:33 right in so if we were to take that and
51:37 turn it into an analogy for our
51:39 education especially with our kids and
51:43 us then the whole thing is a game of
51:48 cutting off the umbilical cord again the
51:52 guide that taught me security encryption
51:56 and private and public key systems
51:59 creating those big giant prime numbers
52:03 and all that good stuff he he had just
52:07 secured NORAD just before he taught me
52:11 which I think was about a six-week thing
52:14 which may sound like a short period of
52:16 time but there's not much to it again
52:20 didn't need to get a PhD in encryption
52:23 and I mean just just to to get you folks
52:29 that aren't programmers to understand
52:30 I entered 1996 knowing very little about
52:38 the internet I had been on it in the
52:39 text form in about 1990 I did a telnet
52:43 session and watch my buddy check his
52:45 email through telnet 1993 to 95 I was
52:52 visiting some websites but had no idea
52:54 how it was working my boss I think it
52:58 was like summertime their spring or
53:01 something it was like March he brings me
53:05 into his office he sits me down he goes
53:06 you're gonna program the internet
53:09 extension to our database package I was
53:13 like what it doesn't that take a lot of
53:15 training so no it's easy he grabbed a
53:17 piece of paper drew on it and just kept
53:20 talking to me
53:22 for what amounted I mean I'm not even
53:24 joking 30-minute session with this guy I
53:27 looked at this piece of paper and I was
53:29 like it's that easy he said yeah he said
53:33 I need you to create a web browser I
53:35 need you to create a web server I need
53:37 you to create a bunch of you know page
53:40 scraping technology I need to create
53:42 email package with enclosures I need
53:44 Japan FTP client I was done and standing
53:48 in front of 600 people where I was
53:51 sitting actually everyone else was
53:52 either sitting or standing in this room
53:55 demoing all my products what was that
53:59 three months that's how fast you can
54:04 learn some of this stuff without formal
54:06 education in those particular areas
54:08 right I think you guys are all very
54:12 aware of the old saying if you keep
54:18 repeating the same thing expecting
54:20 different results that's the definition
54:21 the purest definition of insanity so
54:26 based on that little statement we have
54:29 to start thinking differently about all
54:31 things that we think need to be
54:33 corrected course corrected completely
54:35 changed and this religion which is now
54:40 science with the capital S and flying
54:42 quotes and a neon sign has to be
54:46 disabled the challenges today is that
54:50 the school systems are so atrocious at
54:54 least in America that you have your
54:58 geeks that do really well but what's
55:00 what's fascinating about it is that in
55:03 my school history okay and again I
55:06 didn't hang out it went to so many
55:07 different schools and different towns
55:09 that only the kids from my hometown were
55:13 actually gret ended up coming back to
55:14 graduate or the kids that I remember and
55:16 then got to see take their education and
55:19 become something or not become something
55:23 no again no one has to be famous or
55:26 anything like that to be an amazing
55:28 person there are people that went off to
55:30 become mothers and they're the most
55:31 amazing humans on planet earth so and
55:34 dudes went off to just
55:35 you know have a normal 9 to 5 job they
55:38 fish they take their family on vacations
55:40 those are completely super successful
55:43 life's right as I guess as long as they
55:46 don't drink the kool-aid and vote for
55:47 the wrong thing
55:48 but I know people with you know 4.0
55:53 grade point averages who really
55:57 struggled with life and I mean they made
55:59 some SuperDuper bad decisions man I mean
56:03 I won't even get anyone's personal life
56:05 but I mean it's it's a it's maybe
56:09 they're better today hopefully right we
56:11 all make mistakes but some of these
56:13 people with great you know 4.0 grape
56:16 averages and they were telling me
56:18 they're gonna go to med school and do
56:19 all this other stuff some actually
56:21 enrolled and then failed instantaneously
56:24 and part of its because you know
56:29 studying and memorizing and repeating is
56:31 something that's some people are really
56:34 really good at and they tend to get
56:36 these degrees but post degree they can't
56:42 write a paper they can't become an
56:44 educator because they forgot everything
56:48 that they learned because all it was was
56:50 regurgitation they kind of have an
56:52 instinct about things sometimes at best
56:54 for the people that don't do too well so
56:58 I've said several times one of the best
56:59 things you can do for yourself and again
57:02 for those of you from big giant towns
57:03 and big giant schools and you only know
57:05 a few people I understand why you don't
57:07 go to class reunions but I feel like I
57:10 have totally lucked out with the teeny
57:11 tiny town teeny tiny group of people and
57:14 now I get to see the full ecosystem of
57:17 humanity from high school up and some of
57:22 the kids that were not that good in
57:24 school became amazingly successful
57:28 people and again this isn't necessarily
57:32 anything that's gonna you know be hit
57:34 the news but you know they created
57:35 businesses they were just really clever
57:38 because for them you know it's it's the
57:41 old psychological two-party system which
57:45 is either you're a stringer or you're a
57:46 grouper
57:47 Stringer's are really good at taking
57:49 tests and reading books but they also
57:51 feel guilty if they skip a page because
57:54 it's not that relevant to me the
57:56 author's you know reiterating a little
57:59 too much you know like okay I get it I
58:01 get it
58:01 the next page here already because life
58:05 isn't a stringing experience go here do
58:09 this do that you make this paycheck you
58:11 never get fired you've got a pension you
58:13 can retire at 60 or whatever all my
58:17 buddies in Hollywood work until the day
58:20 they die because they love what they do
58:23 I'm a chronic grouper at least in a
58:26 natural state I'm a grouper life is is
58:30 exactly how my mind thinks it's
58:32 object-oriented right anything can
58:34 happen at any point in time and the way
58:36 you survive it is to be as informed as
58:39 possible about you know what could
58:42 happen and then you're ready for it and
58:45 you pine for it you know we're in a
58:47 situation now where people you know
58:50 people are bringing their businesses
58:51 back online I've now got some clients
58:55 that went dead
58:56 whenever this thing started they're now
58:58 coming back online and through the
59:00 grapevine I'm getting you know a little
59:02 bit of action here so it's good but
59:05 yours truly just can't sit around
59:07 forever making no money I'll lose my
59:09 house I'll lose my car I'll lose
59:10 everything that I own because I won't
59:12 have any money to put it anywhere and
59:16 you know places you can go to
59:18 I mean I'll put your stuff in storage I
59:20 guess and go squat at somebody's house I
59:23 mean what an intrusion thank you you've
59:25 never done that your entire lifetime and
59:27 you'd have to do it you know the more
59:30 that you understand the stringing and
59:33 grouping theory usually stringers are
59:36 very left brain and grippers are very
59:38 right brain over the course of your life
59:41 we need to become both we really really
59:44 do it typically naturally happens which
59:45 is nice right what I find with these
59:48 bullies and it's not it's not the
59:52 traditional bully right that's really
59:54 trying to harm you it's just someone is
59:56 trying to force their method on you as
59:59 they're usually stringers
60:01 because in their mind it's just a simple
60:04 process I'm gonna threaten you by which
60:07 will inadvertently put me in control
60:10 it'll take my value proposition to the
60:12 conversation to the next level then I
60:15 expect you to shut up because you will
60:19 have to take my word for it that you're
60:20 a [ __ ]
60:21 and then you better listen up buddy
60:23 because I'll tell on you you know sort
60:27 of what is happening look at this mask
60:29 Fiasco we've got going on in the world
60:31 right now I'm telling my friends now I
60:35 said look everybody wearing a mask right
60:36 now if there's a second phase of this
60:38 virus that's real let's just put that
60:41 way they're gonna be the first people to
60:43 get infected the first people to have
60:45 the roughest ride with this thing if not
60:48 a fatal ride those of us still mingling
60:52 keeping our herd immunity up not
60:54 overdoing hand sanitizers and washing
60:58 ourselves every single time we just
60:59 enter reality our immune systems will be
61:03 as high as possible again you have to
61:05 eat right you take your vitamins and get
61:07 some Sun on your face and all those are
61:10 good things but it's funny the I went to
61:16 a grocery store today and you know I've
61:20 got a mask in my car I just won't do it
61:23 I'm just not gonna [ __ ] do tyranny
61:25 I'm just not gonna ever say to anybody
61:29 yeah I put a mask on you know if I'm
61:32 sick maybe and I got to go in public
61:34 it's almost at the point now I think
61:37 maybe I'll take up the Asian technique
61:40 which is if you're sick you really
61:42 contagious you got a call for whatever
61:44 which doesn't really happen to me
61:45 anymore cuz I take my seat and I get in
61:47 the Sun and I eat fairly well but if I
61:50 did maybe I would wear a mask just to be
61:52 polite to others take my food home
61:55 instead of eat it in public you know but
62:00 for me that has logic to it but we're
62:05 sitting in the middle of a cesspool of
62:10 extremely well-funded pseudoscience
62:14 and you know where they don't care if
62:16 you believe it or not it doesn't get a
62:17 hell of a lot of funding but they just
62:19 put a trickle of funding in it
62:20 constantly right so you know the fact we
62:24 went to the moon is mentioned all the
62:26 time Big Bang Theory's that kind of
62:31 stuff
62:34 those are things they don't really care
62:36 whether or not you believe in or not
62:37 certain people do but they're a small
62:39 group of people and then we have things
62:41 like climate change which is part of
62:43 genda 21s backbone it's the skeleton of
62:46 the gin 21 they're putting tens of
62:52 hundreds if not well of billions of
62:55 dollars if not trillions of dollars
62:56 every decade into making that come true
63:00 because that's their fantasy I'm gonna
63:03 tell you I think I said it in the other
63:05 episode but that 2012 Olympic ceremony
63:12 has awakened more people than anything
63:20 I've ever mentioned to anyone ever they
63:24 have seen the coronavirus stage they've
63:26 seen the grim reaper who was was a 20 30
63:29 40 feet tall seeing these dancers on
63:32 what looks like about 19 18 Circa beds
63:36 that re-enacting the death except it's
63:39 not an influenza which is h1n1 which is
63:42 the 1918 flu they're standing on a
63:45 corona stage that just it looks exactly
63:49 like the corona virus men online people
63:53 are rejecting it like crazy in the
63:55 comment sections of articles and posts
63:59 on twitter brilliant people the smartest
64:02 people we have on planet earth are
64:04 fighting back and because these people
64:08 are sheep you simply have to remind them
64:14 because again what they really want is
64:17 to be on the winning team they want to
64:20 be relevant they want to have value well
64:24 the first thing like I mentioned many
64:26 many years ago
64:28 is that we have to be kind to everyone
64:32 constantly this is this something you
64:34 switch off I mean maybe if you're going
64:36 through a traumatic situation but if you
64:37 are and you know you're being a little
64:39 cantankerous with the world or dialed
64:42 out or whatever you need to recover
64:45 perhaps you limit your engagement with
64:48 other people until you get through your
64:50 funk but if you do have to engage with
64:52 someone and you're feeling like you're
64:53 having a really bad day tell the other
64:56 person that this is what you're going
64:59 through right now I've been in public
65:00 places a hundred times where people
65:03 would say you know hey man I haven't
65:05 seen you in a while where you been and
65:07 I'm just standing there you know in line
65:08 or something or even a random person
65:12 gonna say well my mom died yesterday or
65:15 this morning or whatever my best friend
65:18 just passed away just got the call and
65:21 the whole room atmosphere changes and we
65:24 are all on the side of this person
65:27 wishing them well I mean we're wishing
65:30 them well in prayers after they leave
65:32 even if we don't know them if they look
65:34 at us we definitely give an empathetic
65:36 face and they feel loved they feel like
65:42 they got a little bit of support from
65:43 the community right you know I don't
65:46 think I can almost guarantee you my
65:49 parents never ever took me aside and
65:53 said be good to other people
65:57 I had an [ __ ] cousin that was just I
66:02 mean he's mentally [ __ ] deranged I
66:04 know what his problem is but I I told
66:07 the story a long time ago but this was a
66:08 very groundbreaking moment for me as a
66:11 person and I'd be interested in your
66:13 stories where you might have had a
66:14 pivotal moment as a kid where you
66:17 decided to be good not to terrorize your
66:21 parents not to terrorize a neighborhood
66:22 just be known for being a good person
66:25 you know but I must have been like three
66:28 four years old again hardcore listeners
66:32 you've heard this but my cousin was
66:33 standing on my bed and he had all my
66:35 toys and he was throwing them down on a
66:37 hardwood floor
66:39 and what was funny about it is my
66:41 personality at the time was just sort of
66:45 like it was like it was an old man and a
66:47 little kids body and I was just watching
66:49 this kid and for me it was like a like a
66:51 sociological experiment just looking at
66:53 the kid going I wonder who it's [ __ ]
66:56 up with this kid he's breaking my toys
66:58 or at least he's trying I don't think he
67:01 actually ended up breaking any emits a
67:02 remarkable that my father was in the
67:05 other room with his brother and he of
67:09 course you're hearing this huge
67:10 commotion in the room right my dad comes
67:13 in and this little Punk's standing on
67:17 the bed breaking my stuff I mean what a
67:18 dick right they never changed man he
67:21 never changed and he got balled out I
67:25 mean my dad was like he didn't want to
67:27 touch his brother's kid but he was like
67:29 you know he's a military dude and so boy
67:34 a little bit of piss ran down this kid's
67:37 leg man there's only temporary because
67:41 his brain doesn't work that well but
67:45 that made me kind of think well geez
67:48 what he was doing was really wrong I
67:51 wasn't crazy and like he got in trouble
67:53 I don't want to be in trouble that's
67:54 crappy but why would I break anyone
67:56 else's toys it's their fun to play with
67:58 why would I do that if I break it out of
68:01 jealousy or something and I don't get to
68:03 play with it right it was a very
68:04 formative moment for my life you know
68:07 and I'll just remind you folks that if
68:10 you hear these huge ideas one thing I'm
68:14 reiterating in this season because for
68:17 the very first time in my life I'm
68:18 seeing monumental changes in people's
68:22 consciousness towards good is that you
68:28 know you can now finally I think have
68:31 faith in changing the world for the
68:34 better yes
68:37 you know if part of it is to work it out
68:39 as an analogy in your mind you know
68:43 we're trying to drain the swamp which is
68:45 global we as the citizens and some
68:49 leaders are very dedicated to doing it
68:51 now we as the citizens
68:53 can speak our mind because we don't have
68:55 video cameras on us we're not
68:56 politicians
68:57 we're not celebrities that if we happen
68:59 to lean right /center
69:02 centric constitutional kind of thinking
69:05 that the studios may ban us from working
69:08 you know is it Tim Allen had his show
69:11 cancelled because he was supportive
69:13 Roseanne Barr had her show cancelled and
69:16 got kicked off her show and killed off
69:17 her own [ __ ] property because of a
69:21 tweet she made it was pretty dumb tweet
69:24 but you know my god
69:27 we've got sexual predators out there
69:31 being revered by Hollywood it's just
69:34 crazy
69:34 it's at Roland Polanski right you know I
69:37 did sleep with that 13-year old girl but
69:39 she wanted it mm-hmm
69:41 because there's so many faculties in the
69:43 brain of a thirteen-year-old a man if
69:45 she had graduated high school two years
69:48 later and then college two years after
69:50 that me we could think she was a bit of
69:52 you know advanced for her time or
69:54 something but I don't know of any
69:55 reality for that the internet is
69:59 obviously being censored more now than
70:00 ever
70:03 Zuckerberg who for whatever reason you
70:06 know got a remember he he marries a
70:12 Chinese girl and what she soon a man
70:17 it's cool man find your true love and do
70:19 it but then he tried when when President
70:23 Xi came over here he tried to pray to
70:28 his wife in front of him he made his
70:30 daughter sing a song I think and
70:32 Mandarin or Cantonese or something the
70:35 president of China was like I'm not a
70:38 [ __ ] idiot man I know what you're
70:39 trying to do here you're trying to open
70:42 up the spigot of you know foreign
70:45 investment you're trying to widen your
70:48 grasp
70:48 you know Zuckerberg wants to be on the
70:50 list where he is not killed off and this
70:52 huge mass extinction event at agenda21
70:54 one's to usher in he wants to live so
70:58 they're not all winning at the top
71:00 either man you know if we as the people
71:05 can demonstrate to the leaders of the
71:09 world that they are not going to take
71:11 away our freedoms no matter what I mean
71:15 I have just never seen America come
71:18 together in a way that they have come
71:21 together in this last month it's a
71:23 contagion you talked about the virus
71:25 that's going around it is called freedom
71:28 baby
71:28 the woman since I made my last quran
71:31 episode there's a woman at a park not
71:34 wearing a mask being arrested by two
71:36 police officers also without masks she's
71:40 hauled into prison or not prison in jail
71:43 I'm pretty sure she was released later
71:46 that day but what happens the citizens
71:51 of that town found out where the sheriff
71:52 lived I found out where when these cops
71:54 lives and they surrounded his house
71:58 we're like you're not taking away the
72:00 constitutional rights of this woman
72:01 because she's simply not buying your
72:03 kool-aid man it's amazing law firms are
72:08 all gunning up right now man they are
72:10 getting ready for class action lawsuits
72:12 against States against cops I mean
72:14 against just a few handful that have
72:16 been doing this kind of stuff I mean
72:19 seriously I don't know if I mentioned on
72:22 the show recently but I mentioned to a
72:24 friend of mine we had I think I did so I
72:28 apologize if this is a repeat but this
72:30 is kind of good to stick it in the
72:31 library in a couple different places
72:33 just in case you don't see the other
72:36 episode we had to - guys I think they
72:39 might have been brothers but they held
72:43 up a bank in downtown LA and man they
72:46 were dressed in full body armor some of
72:49 you remember this I think it was like 93
72:52 ish they had so much body armor on that
72:55 they had ak-47s with tons of magazines I
72:59 think they may have had two or three
72:59 giant guns on them bunch of ammo these
73:04 are bad guys not trying to make them you
73:09 know sexy or anything
73:10 cops were shooting them but the body
73:13 armor was just ping ping ping ping they
73:15 would just turn around and then they
73:16 would unload and they had armor-piercing
73:18 rounds
73:19 rama crowns right like 308 which is an
73:22 ak-47 round typically it was going
73:25 through engine blocks and hitting cops
73:27 on the other side of the car
73:28 these poor cops trying to stop this
73:30 thing well one of them was walking down
73:34 the sidewalk helicopters on him he
73:37 finally just decides this is not gonna
73:39 go well and he's not going to prison
73:41 because he's now shot a police officer
73:43 so he knows that if he gets picked up
73:44 and put in jail they're gonna kill him
73:47 they're gonna beat him up they're gonna
73:49 kill him
73:50 you know so he puts a pistol underneath
73:52 his chin blows the top of his head off
73:55 he had a mask on full ski mask on he's a
73:58 little ding at the top drops like a
74:00 second potatoes but the other dude was
74:04 waiting for some other kid to come pick
74:06 him up on a truck I think and so I don't
74:10 remember how he got in this particular
74:11 particulate but he ended up getting shot
74:13 in his side somewhere by a police
74:16 officer and he fell down and he was out
74:18 he was gonna get definitely arrested and
74:20 a sheriff which there are many sheriffs
74:22 in LA of course sat on him they put his
74:27 knee on him and just made sure that he
74:29 was disarmed and he wasn't gonna get
74:31 back up because this was nuts man you
74:33 know he at that point the sheriff's like
74:35 I think he's been shot I see a little
74:37 bit of blood but my guy we unloaded 100
74:39 you know not ten thousand rounds on
74:42 these guys and they just walked away
74:43 from it right because they have so much
74:45 armor on well the guy ends up dying I
74:48 think on the spot he took a little while
74:51 to die because it took a little while
74:53 figure out if there were other gunmen
74:55 they were trying to rest the kid in the
74:56 truck and it was just a cluster
74:58 well the guy dies the sheriff was doing
75:02 his job all the cops were just doing
75:04 their job had no idea this kind of stuff
75:06 was gonna occur because they do blew
75:09 himself away on the sidewalk definitely
75:12 not an FF it's real and the crazy thing
75:16 was it was like a little teeny Bank I
75:18 don't know how much money it was but it
75:20 wasn't that much cash to be going
75:22 through that much of a problem right
75:24 this was like Ocean's eleven kind of
75:26 snatch and grab and didn't wasn't worth
75:29 it but anyway the family of the guy that
75:32 died second
75:34 ends up suing that sheriff it's been a
75:38 very long time since I try to follow up
75:42 on that information so there may be more
75:43 information to this story that is
75:45 relevant here and I apologize if I don't
75:47 have all the details but as I remembered
75:50 it within two years the family one tries
75:55 to sue the precinct don't remember where
75:59 that lawsuit went but they went after
76:01 the guy in civil court because you can
76:05 any human being that takes away your
76:07 rights it doesn't matter where they work
76:09 you consume the civil court the dude had
76:13 his pension gutted and I think
76:17 eventually he was let off but it gutted
76:22 him financially
76:24 let me just imagine you're just guy
76:26 doing your job and you get you lose
76:28 everything right a lot of these guys
76:30 have to mortgage their homes you know
76:32 they put all their money into their home
76:33 and other properties will they mortgage
76:35 everything they can to pay off attorneys
76:37 so that they don't lose the I think the
76:39 LAPD just let him go I mean there's
76:41 nothing they could do to legally help
76:43 the guy they can't just write him a
76:44 check out of the tax payers dollars
76:45 right it's just like general Flynn you
76:49 know the government can't go in and give
76:51 Flynn money so he can fight this these
76:53 ridiculous charges he had on him right
76:57 so every single police officer out there
77:00 that is violating religious rights I
77:03 mean these these cops are oh people
77:05 tickets in these church parking lots in
77:09 their cars completely quarantined for
77:12 the rest probably the most effective way
77:13 to be in public and not affect anyone
77:15 else but still as your family which you
77:17 already live with is to be in a car
77:19 you're all showered up and your Sunday
77:21 best and you're sitting in the car
77:23 listen to your rating these guys give
77:24 them all 500 all our tickets I'm I'm
77:27 gonna an attorney general bar called
77:29 them all up and said you do that one
77:31 more time and I'm gonna [ __ ] you up
77:33 so now they're done they're not doing it
77:35 anymore but they're chasing you know
77:38 housewife's with kids because they're
77:40 not wearing masks dragging a guy off a
77:42 bus and what Pennsylvania or
77:44 Philadelphia something
77:47 the people are fighting back I've never
77:50 seen it in my lifetime heard about it
77:53 during the sixties rights and all that
77:55 kind of stuff but that was really just
77:56 kind of like I'm program we're gonna
77:58 march out against the war the
78:00 government's not gonna listen they
78:02 didn't listen I don't even think are
78:05 pulling out and what 74 or whatever had
78:07 anything to do with those protests as
78:09 much as we'd like to think so I think
78:12 that Martin Luther King had a huge
78:14 impact with his marches in his speeches
78:17 but we shouldn't have to rely on a
78:20 Martin Luther King all the time one
78:24 person with a voice one genius that sees
78:27 it all holding us all up because they
78:31 could just kill that person
78:32 they can't kill every single one of us
78:34 you know how many times have you seen
78:36 the memes online where says what what
78:38 could they possibly do if we all came
78:40 out that would sick about it
78:43 and this is where I think a court case
78:45 would be so utterly shortened is that we
78:50 know that these Constitution United
78:51 States and again I don't know what your
78:53 country has but it supersedes all things
78:56 you cannot under any circumstance
78:59 violate the constitution of United
79:01 States you can't now the Fourth
79:02 Amendment is getting violated every
79:04 single day
79:05 which is why they had to put the FISA
79:07 Court over for the data and say okay
79:08 we're gathering all the information but
79:10 we are not looking at it until we get a
79:12 FISA warrant you know we know certain
79:15 agencies do even though it's illegal but
79:19 that's something that's over grandma's
79:20 head right okay grandma you know every
79:23 time you send a text well I don't send
79:24 text messages well you know you kind of
79:26 said you know our grandchild won oh that
79:29 would days yeah yeah well they gather up
79:31 all your data okay I'm lost already okay
79:34 but if you told grandma you can't go to
79:36 the grocery store because you're locked
79:39 in your house why well they say there's
79:42 a pandemic 1 million people died no but
79:45 they've made projections like Al Gore
79:47 that it was gonna happen now all the
79:48 projections are wrong and of course they
79:50 want to take credit for those
79:52 projections going south but was because
79:55 we did what we did if if kovat hasn't
79:59 talked to you about
80:01 fake bully science I don't know what
80:06 will
80:08 we're all scared we're all scared to say
80:10 anything against it again I'll just
80:14 remind you there's a correlation between
80:15 climate change theory and kovat theory
80:19 and it goes like this
80:21 climate change says the world is
80:24 supposed to have perfect weather
80:26 according to its geographical location
80:28 on earth so if it's supposed to be cold
80:30 and freezing well it's supposed to be
80:31 cold and freezing it can never ever ever
80:33 raise above zero Celsius or above 32
80:36 degrees Fahrenheit it can't because
80:40 they've just decided they're entitled to
80:42 good weather everywhere they go if
80:44 there's a hot day in Vegas while my god
80:46 the world's gonna end if there's a cold
80:48 day in the winter and Cannes as well oh
80:49 my god the whole world's gonna end
80:51 because they're entitled to perfect
80:54 weather constantly well how does it work
80:57 with kovat no one's ever to have an
81:00 abrupt death because of an illness they
81:03 didn't see I just watched a young little
81:08 documentary someone made about people in
81:11 Star Trek franchise that have passed
81:13 away that you didn't know they passed
81:15 away and I'd say about half of them now
81:20 of course this is the kid that had the
81:21 accident with the Jeep both of both the
81:24 little kids are dead I didn't realize
81:26 both of them are dead but look the kid
81:29 that played the little Klingon he's gone
81:30 and then the kid that played a little
81:34 Ferengi is gone it's just nuts but half
81:40 of these deaths were like really fast
81:42 deaths member Jim Henson the dude just
81:45 got the flu or something and he was gone
81:47 I mean he wasn't a spring chicken but he
81:50 was hardly elderly it took me a while to
81:54 remember that one of the most random
81:57 causes of death that has been in my life
82:00 with first degree maybe second degree
82:02 friends is pneumonia pneumonia can just
82:08 hit anyone at any age the perfect storm
82:11 because there's 7.5 billion people on
82:13 this planet a perfect storm
82:14 happen way more than you think with
82:16 medical problems because we were weaned
82:18 off of healthy food under sugar sugar
82:20 sugar yeah you do have an 18 year old
82:24 kid catch a pass make a touchdown and on
82:27 his way back to the locker room he has a
82:29 heart attack because he's drinking like
82:32 four or five energy drinks a day in his
82:34 arteries as hard as glass right but
82:39 today with kovat the one they keep
82:43 lowering the standard of what qualifies
82:45 for co vid right so all other illnesses
82:47 are like vanishing off the face of the
82:48 planet like the only way we die on
82:50 planet earth now is cough it right it's
82:52 not even a joke they're lowering the
82:55 standards they're subsidizing payments
82:58 to hospitals so they can monetize these
83:00 fake diagnoses test kits still suck
83:04 right I read a report that said that any
83:08 test kit for a human condition has about
83:12 a 10 to 15 percent chance of a false
83:14 positive but but he called me with the
83:15 date and he said look I was being tested
83:18 for all this stuff while he was at the
83:20 hospital
83:22 he said he tested positive for HIV twice
83:26 while he was in the hospital and of
83:28 course his doctor was like cuz his
83:30 t-cell levels were all over the place on
83:32 a daily hourly basis and he says doctor
83:35 goes I know you don't have HIV but
83:36 you've come up you know positive so I'm
83:39 gonna run your tests again because the
83:40 tests are coming back crappy but with
83:43 you know 10 to 15% false positives on
83:47 any one test that you take you know it's
83:50 it's a blurry science but what's no moan
83:54 you do it attacks your lungs
83:58 now when you catch something catch
84:00 anything fluid in your lungs is a very
84:03 basic problem that you start having and
84:07 so I think that everyone's getting
84:12 entitled you're never to die of anything
84:14 random you can do lines of coke you can
84:19 eat crappy food GMO foods you can eat
84:22 out of fast food all day long you're not
84:23 to gain any weight and you never did
84:25 have any catastrophic organ failures
84:27 your immune system you're entitled to a
84:30 beautiful immune system no matter what
84:32 you do to your body you can be entitled
84:35 to a great mewn system as long as you
84:37 treat your body well but maybe you have
84:40 to get out and walk every once in a
84:41 while you know I went on a big walk
84:44 today but there's closeted alcoholics
84:48 all over the place two men and they I
84:50 mean I dated this girl he's amazing but
84:53 I met her online through a funny little
84:58 plain words with friends thing and then
85:02 I made friends with her and I said we
85:06 should go on a date and she's like why
85:09 and I said well because and it's just
85:11 well I'm really sick today she slows
85:13 down you know a few miles from me and I
85:15 said well let me bring you a little care
85:17 package to help you out okay great well
85:20 she played it off like she had the cold
85:21 or a flu what does she really have a
85:24 massive hangover and it was like a
85:28 weekly thing drinking so much that she
85:32 had major health issues she already had
85:34 some pre-existing
85:35 conditions as well and so what if she
85:40 were to get ammonia in the midst of
85:42 binging alcohol which absolutely
85:44 obliterates your immune system well
85:48 she'd go to the hospital she would have
85:51 no immune system to fight pneumonia and
85:53 then she's literally in a life-and-death
85:55 situation she's on a ventilator she's
85:57 got every single symptom kovat claims to
85:59 have which at this point now they're
86:01 trying to blur those lines intensely but
86:05 yeah I went to the store and they said I
86:06 forgot to finish my story I went to the
86:08 grocery store and they I couldn't get in
86:10 without a mask on and it's like okay
86:16 this is hysteria at this point right
86:18 what's interesting is is I think that a
86:21 lot of you remember that the world was a
86:24 lot smarter without much technology we
86:30 just thought logically and someone in my
86:35 hometown a woman just turned 109 the
86:38 other day and this is the story I've
86:41 been repeating since I started the show
86:44 my hometown the obituary is very
86:47 interesting because you have this group
86:49 of people dying at a hundred that she's
86:51 not even dead yet she just had her ninth
86:53 birthday but you have all these people
86:55 were still alive at around a hundred or
86:57 above and the people that are dying or
87:00 in their 90's or super late 80s and then
87:04 there's this blank spot where no one's
87:08 alive because they all died in their 50s
87:11 and 60s and the timeline overlay to
87:15 these people's deaths and their
87:16 obituaries is that they were in the
87:19 margarine saccharin aspartame GMO world
87:25 they were being weaned off of healthy
87:28 foods they stayed inside more because
87:31 they're watching TV more they're getting
87:33 fat you know and they're just they're
87:35 having issues now if you know what
87:38 you're doing and you're willing to take
87:40 the risk because this is just the life
87:41 that you love I mean that you know
87:43 you're not contagious if you have a
87:44 heart attack because you're obese you
87:47 know probably a lot of us would wish
87:49 you would live longer but if you're
87:50 happy all the way to the very end that's
87:52 your business but what I'm talking about
87:54 are the people that have no clue that
87:57 they're doing this to the to themselves
87:59 right I think it was Artie did an
88:04 article a few weeks ago and they said
88:08 they were actually acknowledging I don't
88:11 like Artie I mean they write a bunch of
88:13 absolutely disinfo articles they try to
88:18 create World War 3 every single day that
88:21 they can I swear to God
88:23 if there's an evil regime Artie is
88:25 completely for them it's crazy but they
88:28 said they finally connected the dots
88:29 between this glorifying obesity and this
88:32 fat shaming movement and said this isn't
88:35 working this isn't working
88:38 you're telling kids that it's totally
88:39 cool to be obese and telling the parents
88:41 that their kids being obese because
88:43 usually the parents are obese is totally
88:45 cool but these kids are racking up
88:48 massive medical bills before they're
88:50 even 20 years old because they're having
88:54 problems that nobody has at that age as
88:56 long as you eat normal food one of the
88:59 things you might do because I think that
89:00 one of the sort of subtexts of a lot of
89:04 the shows if I don't mention it outright
89:06 which I have in many of the episodes but
89:08 I like to give you guys weaponry to
89:14 fight the good fight you know and try to
89:17 build you that Batman belt that no
89:19 matter what the hell's going on that
89:21 guy's life he's got a little thing he
89:22 pulls out to do it right to solve his
89:24 bran he's falling off a building he's
89:26 got a raster you know boom he throws up
89:28 there and doesn't cut him in half it
89:30 perfectly stops him slow and he couldn't
89:32 crawl up the side of the building right
89:34 we need a lot bunch of those and that's
89:38 the power of memes to man who would have
89:41 ever thought 30 years ago that you would
89:44 see a picture with some words on it that
89:47 is worth 10 years of conspiratorial
89:49 investigation right
89:51 just one little meme makes you go oh
89:53 yeah this is screwed up if they're
89:56 usually the best memes reveal
90:00 truthful counter logic to pseudoscience
90:04 to pseudo groupthink herd mentality what
90:09 are the other phenomenons and being the
90:11 author of this show is that I get a lot
90:15 of messages from folks that are just
90:17 it's sort of like the best messages I
90:19 get from folks cuz it's almost unanimous
90:21 everyone has to send me this sort of
90:24 message and it warms my heart when I get
90:26 these sort of communications whether it
90:28 be public public posts in a comment
90:30 section on YouTube or in our Facebook
90:32 group it's locked but a lot of private
90:34 messages too which is someone says
90:37 something like you know you're
90:40 completely right about that this is
90:42 [ __ ]
90:43 you know my country's doing this you
90:45 know I say stealing that where I live
90:47 it's this way and it's completely insane
90:50 people might work or drinking the
90:52 kool-aid and and I'm the only one awake
90:54 or whatever someone's got a spouse
90:56 that's still asleep because at least
91:01 that's the first stage again we trade
91:05 information without speaking that's
91:08 another thing you have to remember so
91:11 the more that you become educated it
91:14 takes a lot longer to transfer
91:15 information I think unless you're having
91:17 a conversation about it but that's why
91:22 when I have conversations with friends
91:24 of mine you believe all this hyped up
91:26 science you know the pseudo kind I can
91:30 get a vibe off somebody that they're
91:32 informed or I can get a Bible of someone
91:34 that it's just a machine talking to me
91:38 and then there's sort of that second
91:40 tier assessment which is okay do they
91:42 really mean the world good and usually
91:46 comes back absolutely we're just
91:48 disagreeing about what's wrong and
91:50 exactly how to fix it one of the ones
91:55 that I mentioned a lot I mentioned it
91:57 several times on the show but if we're
91:59 just going to trade tricks here
92:01 is that you know someone says trying to
92:06 guilt-trip me for nuclear power plants
92:08 or oil or coal or yo some use of energy
92:11 and I just stopped them in their tracks
92:14 and it's funny because when I see what
92:16 I'm about to say they have no recourse
92:20 and you see them start to be Robby the
92:23 Robot with the logic problem
92:24 self-destructing and I say I'll let them
92:28 get get it all out of their system
92:30 because they think if you're again
92:32 defending freedom then you're for you
92:34 know killing babies or something it's
92:35 weird
92:38 quite the opposite isn't it but I'll say
92:41 look did you choose oil
92:44 did your parents choose all did your
92:47 grandparents choose oil did your
92:48 great-great-great grandparents choose
92:50 oil mine didn't and yours didn't either
92:54 did you choose nuclear power plants so
92:56 you could refine up you know uranium
93:00 fuel to be made into plutonium it's a
93:02 business it's part of the pipeline of
93:03 making plutonium is to have nuclear
93:05 power plants it's part of the game
93:07 that's why they what they do not want
93:10 Iran to have a nuclear power plant it
93:13 allows them to refine uranium and other
93:17 things that can turn into plutonium once
93:21 you let them know that no one's making
93:25 these choices but the people at the top
