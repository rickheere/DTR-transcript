00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts on this
00:31 beautiful 78 degree October day I'm
00:37 gonna go smoke-free today because I had
00:39 to wash my buddy smoke shop over the
00:41 weekend and I've just smoked out so even
00:47 yours truly doesn't smoke as much as you
00:49 think half the time I thought today we
00:52 would talk about the definition and
00:54 overall operation of humanity around
00:59 this concept of corruption because it's
01:03 the assertion constantly in our society
01:05 right now in the United States of
01:07 America it's ridiculous you know most
01:11 countries operate in this sort of
01:13 emperor has no Emperor has clothes on
01:15 thing where even though the emperor
01:19 doesn't have clothes on everything's
01:20 screwed up and you know corporations
01:23 work with governments work with
01:26 religious institutions or what have you
01:30 everyone covers up constantly even the
01:33 citizens of a country that are being
01:35 harmed by the corruption can actually
01:37 pretend like they're not being harmed
01:39 because then they would have to
01:41 acknowledge they allowed their country
01:42 to get completely out of control
01:43 and they don't want to admit it so it's
01:47 just one generation of cognitive
01:50 dissidents and to another and to know
01:52 like a Russian doll of matrix inside
01:55 matrix inside matrix to the point where
01:57 no one knows what's going on constantly
02:00 now obviously for the 21st century and
02:04 for all of the Jin Z's Millennials Gen
02:08 Xers and some baby boomers who are
02:12 considering themselves part of the Great
02:14 Awakening we have a massive beautiful
02:18 advantage and our time but we need to
02:21 move we need to do things we need to
02:23 spread the information I have never seen
02:26 more YouTube channels pop up and the
02:29 what 15 years that's been around than
02:32 the last two years people going from
02:35 having no channels at all to having
02:38 hundreds of thousand subscribers by
02:40 doing daily reports on the queue
02:42 anonymous movement or politics or what
02:44 have you is just astonishing you know
02:48 now I could probably have the same kind
02:51 of thing if I were into reporting on
02:55 this kind of stuff but I just find it to
02:57 be soul rotting you know so deep
03:01 thoughts is really aimed at going at the
03:04 subtext of human thought you know let's
03:07 get our ball bearings together before we
03:10 introduce a high level concept like
03:12 who's president's who's a senator who's
03:14 smuggling guns through North Korea let's
03:17 just figure out how we deal with
03:19 managing our time finding our goals
03:22 dealing with you know me myself and I
03:26 thing etc so corruption what is it how
03:31 do you define it because some countries
03:34 and some people in the world have
03:37 completely different definitions of what
03:39 corruption might be I think the simplest
03:42 technique is to lean back on common law
03:45 and say do no harm but then you have to
03:49 figure out what you believe is a do no
03:52 harm situation don't physically hurt
03:54 someone don't steal don't physically
03:57 hurt someone so bad you kill them you
03:59 know they know there's ones like don't
04:01 covet your buddy's wife and that kind of
04:04 stuff that's just good advice okay
04:06 that's just really good advice you
04:08 should take but what if inside common
04:11 law there was this definition which said
04:14 you know don't offend anyone well then
04:17 anything can happen
04:18 right anything can happen because you
04:21 can be offended just by changing your
04:24 psychological state and then of course
04:27 you'll have organizations in order to
04:30 manipulate society will convince them
04:32 that now this is particularly offensive
04:34 we see it all the time with the thought
04:39 police political correctness movements
04:43 the people that actually believe that
04:45 political correctness is a good thing or
04:48 immediately the candidates for
04:51 individuals that need
04:52 you know brain surgery they need
04:55 psychological evaluations and
04:57 conditioning to get them back to normal
05:00 because what they have done is they have
05:02 developed a life where they hate
05:04 themselves and they hate their life and
05:06 what they're trying to do is control
05:08 something they probably feel like they
05:10 have no control their life as well I
05:11 mean obviously if you get to a point you
05:13 completely hate your life I think that
05:16 that goes hand in hand with you have no
05:18 control of your life and so the idea is
05:21 in order to have a semblance of feeling
05:23 that you actually make a difference that
05:25 you're worthwhile these individuals will
05:28 go out and start to police things and
05:31 boy it's free it's free to have a
05:33 political correctness oh you can't say
05:37 this most insane when I hear all the
05:40 time is you can't say the N word with ER
05:42 on the end but you could say it with an
05:43 A on the end
05:44 cycle really is a somehow not extremely
05:47 offensive just because you say it in a
05:49 slightly different way what do you mean
05:51 by when you say that word well if you
05:54 don't mean something I guess racist and
05:56 mean who cares how you spell it
05:59 but you know it's like that's I love
06:01 that one because that one is like it's
06:03 the same word you're just pronouncing it
06:06 differently
06:06 I mean it's so funny because you know
06:10 you know I don't typically use that word
06:12 when I was younger we used to use it
06:15 from a friend a friend and it wasn't
06:19 never in a racist context ever ever ever
06:23 but now you hear people trying to use it
06:27 and enunciate it in a way that you can
06:29 hear the spelling because boy they don't
06:31 want their the ER to happen they need
06:33 the odda happen because otherwise you're
06:34 horrible human being if you have a
06:36 different sulabha on the end of your
06:39 word this is what society has actually
06:42 come down to and if there was some word
06:45 that was for instance horrible for white
06:49 people and and we put this big police
06:52 out because we're the minority of the
06:53 world where were the physical minority
06:56 of the world white people and we said
06:59 hey you can't say this well the last
07:03 thing I would do if I was so offended by
07:05 saying
07:06 word would be to say it in my own
07:07 household would be to make a bunch of
07:09 rap music where I'm using that word that
07:12 is so offensive and in making an
07:13 endearing greeting to my brothers and
07:16 sisters and what-have-you
07:17 I mean but this is the way it's been
07:20 worked out with the n-word it's like hey
07:23 either that's a horrible word and we
07:25 shouldn't use it or it's not a hobo word
07:27 and we can use it you know but someone
07:32 is gonna figure out another word that
07:33 means the same thing and just take a
07:36 little while for it to get demonized so
07:38 it's how about dumb and stupid that's a
07:40 pretty those are pretty intense words
07:44 depending on how you use them but anyway
07:47 I want to get the fundamental thought
07:49 process and brain process so that you
07:51 can see how just inception points of
07:54 creating this concept of corruption in
07:56 the mind is filtered but when you think
08:01 of corruption that particular word in my
08:04 opinion is only reserved for like higher
08:06 end ideas a politician selling out their
08:09 country like Obama like Hillary the
08:12 pay-to-play give her Foundation a ton of
08:14 money and then she'll greenlight a bunch
08:16 of stuff that you want done you know
08:18 Biden and his son Hunter
08:20 you know hey kid knows nothing about
08:23 anything he's absolutely a proven loser
08:27 you know he's a drug addicts he can't
08:29 follow he can't follow discipline enough
08:33 to stay in the Navy and then all of a
08:36 sudden without any energy knowledge
08:38 whatsoever
08:39 he gets 50 to 150 thousand dollars a
08:43 month from these various organizations
08:44 of the Ukraine in China just
08:46 unbelievable right that's what we
08:50 usually think of when we think of
08:51 corruption but there's all kinds of
08:54 levels of corruption right now for the
08:57 layman what's interesting is is you know
09:02 let's say that you know I've never built
09:04 a apartment complex or a hotel in New
09:09 York City and it depends on what year
09:12 you're doing it is it's you know it's
09:15 the problems you're gonna run into
09:17 corruption tends to attract - money or
09:22 power for instance let's say that New
09:27 York City can usually take any
09:29 establishment and turn a buck make a
09:32 tremendous amount of money if you open a
09:34 hotel you'll make a tremendous amount of
09:36 money you open a restaurant that's
09:37 really nice you make a tremendous amount
09:38 of money so let's just say you know you
09:43 have to first come up with the finance
09:45 finances to build these sorts of things
09:47 but at the same time you have to get
09:50 building permits to get certain things
09:52 done ah let's see so you can play the
09:56 game on all sides plus you have to
09:58 convince a union to give you a decent
10:00 rate to build your facility so all these
10:05 people in organized crime which are not
10:08 your big mafioso guys now there may be
10:10 an element of that depending on what
10:13 decade you're trying to build your
10:15 casino your hotel or whatever but
10:18 straight up normal people could decide
10:21 to be difficult a mayor a governor a
10:26 congresswoman or congressman could
10:30 simply say well I don't think I'm gonna
10:31 I'm still thinking about whether or not
10:33 to allow you to make that Hotel build
10:35 that hotel there do this build this Golf
10:37 Course and they're sitting there holding
10:40 out for a paycheck of some sort and
10:43 again I say of some sort because
10:45 sometimes cash payments are way too
10:50 risky they're easy to follow sometimes
10:53 it would be giving someone a summer
10:55 house a car it could be just that you
10:58 have a gentleman's agreement that
11:00 whoever Yorke's you're bribing gets to
11:02 stay at your facility that you're
11:04 building for free forever because
11:06 without their approval your thing's
11:08 never going to take place but in the
11:10 real world I mean she excuse me in an
11:13 ideal world and this is absurd that I
11:15 have to say ideal world there would be
11:18 no corruption you can simply file for
11:20 your permit it is so monitored the
11:24 process of you applying for your land
11:27 permit to build the hotel all
11:29 circumstances and decision
11:31 our aboveboard videotaped any private
11:33 conferences about your property are also
11:36 transcribed for the people and a you
11:40 know request for information act sort of
11:42 thing the Freedom of Information Act a
11:46 FOIA request and you just get it you
11:51 know someone could build a hotel and
11:52 it's put them out a couple thousand
11:54 dollars just to pay off people to fill
11:56 out the forms right cuz you don't know
11:58 how necessarily so you pay a
11:59 professional to do that then you're done
12:01 but you know it doesn't work like that
12:04 anyone has to do stuff like that it's
12:06 gotta do a couple things you have to pay
12:10 off all the official people and boy it's
12:12 depends on what day of the week you
12:14 catch them the whether or not they want
12:15 a thousand dollars or a hundred thousand
12:17 dollars or a million dollars through
12:19 some you know do what is a Leonardo
12:22 painting being sold or Michelangelo
12:23 painting or you're okay I got this thing
12:26 and susta B's I want you to buy it
12:28 and you know my guy there he's gonna
12:31 push it up to 300 million you buy it and
12:35 then you're gonna have your hotel no one
12:38 will know the difference plus you can
12:41 hang it back in your hotel it'll be
12:43 great
12:43 big attraction piece but then you have
12:48 organized-crime true organized crime
12:50 which could be the police could be a
12:53 mafia type situation i think a lot of
12:57 that's and the mafia realm was calmed
12:58 down quite a bit but you know i was
13:03 talking to a gentleman yesterday who was
13:05 rattling off some of his knowledge as an
13:09 attorney about people you have to pay
13:12 off there's some candidates supposedly
13:14 in New York you have to pay off if you
13:16 build in New York in LA you have to pay
13:18 off if you're in LA all major cities
13:20 have these cartels you have to get
13:23 approval from and then you have to pay
13:25 so you're trying to be a legitimate
13:27 business person but if you were to sit
13:31 there and try to be legitimate you would
13:35 never be allowed to build anything to do
13:37 anything you'd never get a permit for
13:40 something well then what do you do
13:42 you're like
13:44 you're the victim of the situation and
13:48 so you're trying to get something to
13:51 actually happen so that people can be
13:53 employed by you and you're gonna be
13:56 straight straight arrow above the board
13:59 kind of person now imagine you have 40
14:03 50 years of this torment of having to
14:05 get through these these membranes of
14:08 corruption and then all of a sudden you
14:12 become the president United States and
14:13 it's your turn to clean out this crap
14:16 because you've been screwed over by it
14:19 your entire life and every single time
14:22 you're screwed over by it and you have
14:24 to give us you know a senator like
14:27 Hillary Clinton and you know New York
14:29 City is the easiest and New York state's
14:31 the easiest country easiest state in the
14:34 Union to buy your election and steal
14:36 your election probably California's
14:38 second so if you're a corrupt scumbag
14:41 that's where you go if you need to get
14:42 an AOC is another huge example of a
14:45 complete abject [ __ ] becoming anything
14:48 in life period but Hillary you know has
14:53 no affiliation with New York she is by
14:55 no means a New Yorker if you know any
14:57 New Yorkers she's just that you know
15:01 complete and utter liar but here she is
15:05 forcing her way into being senator and
15:07 now if you want to get things done that
15:10 have any authoritative oversight by her
15:13 or her group you got to give her money
15:17 interesting it's one of these tumultuous
15:21 situations where you have in some cases
15:24 like a Stockholm Syndrome situation
15:27 where you're being held captive and you
15:30 don't have control but you want to live
15:35 someone tells you well if you don't do
15:37 this this thing that compromises who you
15:41 are and I'm gonna you know this
15:44 creepazoid dude in a basements I'm Joe
15:47 Biden John Podesta or his buddy Ayers
15:49 brother Tony Podesta complete [ __ ]
15:52 murdering pedophiles they have a kid
15:54 down the basement and it's all being
15:56 videotaped and there's photographs take
15:58 it's just it's the worst thing on planet
16:01 earth but the kid doesn't do what they
16:03 tell him to do they're gonna kill him
16:05 of course the Podesta brothers would
16:06 just murder the person just like they
16:08 didn't port your gold that poor little
16:09 girl but if they don't do what they're
16:12 told they die and so you do these things
16:14 and you know you're screwed
16:16 down the end no one would ever blame you
16:20 for doing something or blame the person
16:22 for doing something and what shocks me
16:27 is that this whole last presidency the
16:31 United States has it's one of these
16:34 situations were draining the swamp we
16:40 knew would go in a particular realm if
16:42 you had half a half a brain you knew
16:44 that one you have you know struck and
16:49 page talking about insurance policy
16:52 obviously come--and
16:54 rod Rosenstein and all these folks had
16:56 the insurance policies to get anyone who
16:59 was accidentally elected as president to
17:02 get kicked out through corruption this
17:04 you know [ __ ] some fake thing so the
17:10 the soft-pedal at at first they're they
17:12 can hang we don't need to do anything
17:13 major we're just going to accuse this
17:14 guy working with the Russians the
17:16 American people are going to totally
17:18 believe us because we're totally
17:19 delusional and think we actually are the
17:20 majority when we're they tiny scum on
17:23 the top of the otherwise clean water and
17:29 then when they realize that doesn't work
17:31 it's not working well you got a problem
17:36 don't you
17:37 you got to Ratchet it up so they go for
17:39 round two and round three and round four
17:41 and I don't even know what round we're
17:42 on at this point but you're talking
17:45 about a cabal of deep state mega corrupt
17:50 people mega corrupt so when it comes to
17:55 corruption I'm making accusations well
18:00 they know all the games they invented
18:02 the games they continued the games but
18:06 what do we know about the process of
18:08 trying to eliminate a well-established
18:10 income the
18:12 state organization well the closer you
18:15 get to the pinch off point that moment
18:18 where they're gonna lose everything
18:20 they're all gone but all being arrested
18:23 but they are going to go berserk this is
18:26 pushing the feral corrupt beast into the
18:31 corner and they have to just hit the
18:34 Doomsday Device to get out that is where
18:37 they are right now that is why they have
18:40 gone for a complete absurdity that is
18:43 why Nancy Pelosi sounds like the most
18:47 drugged out crack addict meth addict
18:51 when she goes to a microphone
18:53 she is imploding trying to keep her word
18:57 straight one of the things she's
18:58 starting to suffer from at least
18:59 base-level dementia if not Alzheimer's
19:03 Adam Schiff he's a farmer probably a boy
19:07 touch her just like Biden in the
19:09 Podesta's who has made a life out of
19:13 misdirection but they are all in their
19:17 own minds they can't possibly become
19:20 legit right they can't go visit Trump
19:24 have a little heartfelt conversation and
19:26 say you know what I'm really sorry but I
19:31 was raised in this corrupt environment
19:34 it was the way everything got done it
19:37 has taken me a while to wake up all
19:41 right let's just see you know the
19:42 Democratic Party is destroyed it's over
19:44 so we're gonna have to do something here
19:47 because it needs to be rebuilt I'm gonna
19:49 come out of being an extreme leftist
19:52 globalist socialist communist [ __ ]
19:54 globalist piece of [ __ ] and I'm gonna
19:56 come over here to the center and I'm
20:00 gonna show some bipartisan you know
20:01 abilities to work let's go what do you
20:05 want to what do you wanna do is this
20:06 health care thing let's do something
20:08 else and patch everything up or at least
20:12 attempt to patch things up but they are
20:15 so ignorant to the American people and
20:19 in the public at large that I think they
20:22 actually believe their own hype
20:24 you know again cubed on you know I think
20:29 that at this point it's it's turned into
20:30 a dangerous religion regardless if it's
20:33 true or not Joe in one [ __ ] Twitter
20:35 just he was just he's trying to chastise
20:41 people for not believing in a guy that
20:43 disappeared after the El Paso shooting
20:45 supposedly eight Kern is coming back
20:48 this hñ replacement taken god-awful
20:51 amount of time to get it set up which is
20:54 sort of a joke in general and then you
20:56 know again you're supposed to believe
20:57 well you know Christ disappears that
21:00 even though he said he wasn't gonna
21:02 disappear he did disappear and you're
21:05 supposed to continue believing the plan
21:07 you know I think an idea is the plan so
21:11 this was some live-action role-playing
21:13 thing all you have to do is just say
21:15 here guys would it be cool if I've done
21:17 it a million times on shows right but we
21:19 knew these folks were going to go full
21:22 nuclear before it's over and I actually
21:24 think that the full Nick Euler option
21:26 for the Democratic Party will be to
21:30 physically try to assassinate Donald
21:34 Trump I think that Joe Biden potentially
21:37 was going he may have slipped it up in
21:40 his again stuttering blathering dementia
21:43 by uttering October 17th or the 17th I
21:47 should say during his presidential
21:50 debate and then of course you'd have to
21:53 call it off but then some guy shows up
21:54 to the rally fully packed ready to he's
21:59 got guns on him and all kinds of stuff
22:01 now quite frankly he could have been
22:03 some rah-rah Magog I that was just gonna
22:06 kill someone teef of people who the hell
22:08 knows what the guy's motive was but I I
22:11 wouldn't put any money on that so what
22:14 do we do with corruption because we know
22:16 it's there and if you really start to
22:19 talk about corruption with people you
22:22 usually run into one of two different
22:23 opinions about the subject matter the
22:27 younger generation are like yeah let's
22:29 let's go fix it you know if we need to
22:32 lob heads off well that's just what we
22:34 got to do the older generation
22:37 is tired and indoctrinated one I think
22:42 they lacked the actual genetic
22:43 programming to be able to conceive of
22:46 the of the crimes themselves I had a
22:52 relative mind say that she was going to
22:54 go teach where corporate taxation was
22:59 switched on to the back of the people
23:00 and I said oh well then you're gonna be
23:04 teaching about Jekyll Island and the
23:06 sixteenth amendment and in this typical
23:09 Democrat delusional mind a baby boomer
23:14 mind it was no well actually it all
23:17 started in and just mentioned some
23:20 absolutely obscure bunch of [ __ ] to
23:24 cover the fact that the [ __ ] bankers
23:27 in the you know late nineteen tens had
23:34 sat there on Jekyll Island with
23:36 Philander Knox as their assistant to
23:38 document all things sixteenth amendment
23:40 had figured out how to say okay all the
23:43 taxes in United States of America are
23:45 coming from our corporations and all the
23:47 luxury items like you know firearm
23:49 tobacco and we're tired of paying let's
23:53 get the citizens to pay our share of
23:55 [ __ ] we're gonna exempt ourselves put it
23:58 on their back boom 16th amendment IRS
24:01 Federal Reserve fiat currency it's as
24:04 clear as a bell but the cognitive
24:07 dissidence and an average baby boomer is
24:11 unbelievable I mean it is like a
24:13 physical mind-blowing MKULTRA Gong
24:17 perfectly perfectly to plan and again
24:23 there's that KGB agent that did his
24:26 little interview in 1985 just look up
24:28 KGB agent 1985 confession and you'll see
24:33 it but he said in if I had heard this in
24:38 85 I would have thought this guy was
24:42 completely delusional himself but he was
24:45 totally and completely correct he said
24:48 that the
24:50 shins along with the globalists were
24:53 working out a mental conditioning plan
24:57 such that the human the human being when
25:00 told the truth about something would not
25:02 be able to process the facts because
25:06 their cognitive dissidence circuit in
25:08 their brain has been so massaged by
25:10 other micro events right such as
25:14 political correctness things like the
25:19 Kennedy assassination being carried out
25:20 by Oswald these fake moon missions that
25:24 people jump on subconsciously deep down
25:26 inside I think we know that these things
25:29 are [ __ ] regardless if we can figure
25:30 out what they were 9/11 we know it's
25:33 complete crap we don't know exactly
25:35 exactly exactly who did it and for
25:37 exactly what reasons could have been a
25:39 million different things we don't know
25:42 when it started the plan for it to
25:44 happen started but whatever it defies
25:45 physics and so it's wrong but when it
25:49 comes down to you know in this
25:52 particular case this individual is
25:54 involved in banking and has worked for
25:56 the Federal Reserve for 20 years and so
25:58 if there's any admission of the Federal
26:00 Reserve being created by a cabal of
26:04 banker families out of Europe then this
26:06 person has contributed 20 years of
26:09 corruption to hearses fellow citizens
26:14 and that is actually the truth that is
26:17 actually true this person contributed to
26:20 the regulation of otherwise a
26:21 free-market banking system with real you
26:26 know greenback gold back currencies
26:29 instead it was a Fiat system with
26:32 fractional reserve banking now imagine
26:35 someone being very senior in the Federal
26:37 Reserve for 20 years and then you come
26:40 up to them and you say hey what's this
26:43 [ __ ] about fractional reserve
26:45 banking where if I got a dollar in the
26:46 bank I can loan out nine more dollars
26:48 and then that person says I kid you none
26:52 well I don't know anything about that I
26:55 don't think there's anything like that
26:57 in economics there's nothing called
27:00 fractional reserve banking
27:03 and you're going whoa whoa whoa don't
27:05 you have an MBA right a master's in
27:07 business administration
27:09 don't you have a degree and [ __ ] like
27:11 this how are you working for the Federal
27:14 Reserve but you have no goddamn clue the
27:17 fractional reserve banking not only
27:19 exists but in universities around the
27:22 world even in translated languages
27:24 that's exactly what it's called so now
27:27 you have a covert agent with their head
27:31 up their ass for corruption because they
27:35 can't sense the corruption they won't
27:37 even acknowledge the paradigm of the
27:40 corruption so imagine imagine having at
27:42 the Ponzi scheme all right so you got
27:45 Ponzi schemes and this is where you you
27:47 know you lie about investments that have
27:51 these massive returns you collect a ton
27:53 of money and initially you obviously put
27:57 up a fake front of what's going to come
27:59 back as a result of putting ten dollars
28:02 and you tell them they're going to get
28:03 $12 back within a couple months they
28:08 trust you and then you keep raising
28:10 money and you use the new money you
28:11 raise to pay off the minimum amount of
28:13 profit for your first customers and you
28:15 keep that going as long as you possibly
28:16 can to all the customers go where the
28:19 hell is my money and you've already run
28:21 off with it invested it and they can't
28:24 get you that's a Ponzi scheme right it's
28:26 named after the guy who first did it
28:27 Ponzi which I didn't know until a couple
28:30 years ago but imagine helping someone
28:34 create a Ponzi scheme you're engaging in
28:38 this big borrow and steal thing that is
28:41 a Ponzi scheme and then someone comes up
28:43 to you and says hey man what are you
28:44 doing in this Ponzi scheme what is that
28:46 that's when you do this this and this I
28:49 don't know what you're talking about
28:50 it's exactly what they're doing but they
28:53 can't conceive of it because to conceive
28:56 of it implies responsibility for what
28:59 they're doing you ever wonder why and
29:01 Tifa wears a bunch of little bandanas
29:05 like they're like they're stagecoach
29:09 robbers I'll tell you why
29:13 and once we as Americans start to
29:16 apprehend these pieces of [ __ ] and start
29:20 throwing them into prisons or at least
29:23 gel sales and trying to find out who
29:25 they are
29:26 we won't realize that this is the case
29:29 now of course there are indigenous human
29:31 beings to the United States of America
29:33 who are just you know abject morons
29:38 barely have two brain cells to rub
29:40 together but there are also foreign
29:43 agents that are an American who then
29:48 conceal their foreign agent origins
29:51 remember this happened in the Ukraine a
29:53 bunch of Nazis came into the Ukraine who
29:55 didn't speak Russian or any local
29:57 language they were strictly German
29:59 speaking kids who literally had you know
30:02 swastika tattoos and stuff on them which
30:05 is really strange because I don't even
30:07 see those in Germany it's a soros thing
30:10 so now we have folks that are hiding
30:13 themselves as truly terrorist cell and
30:17 surgeons from foreign countries where
30:20 perhaps the skin color passes for
30:22 American but we're a melting pot so you
30:25 can do pretty much anything in your okay
30:27 and of course the cops in a lot of
30:32 locations although they're starting to
30:33 beat the [ __ ] out of these kids which is
30:35 fantastic our president hasn't done
30:38 anything to declare an Tifa terrorist
30:40 organization yet they have physically
30:42 abused thousands of people and caused
30:45 major bodily harm
30:47 I guess the President of the United
30:49 States is waiting for an tifa member to
30:52 murder someone and then they're gonna
30:54 give a [ __ ] about this threat imagine
30:58 this you run a day care center or you
31:00 put your kid in day care center or
31:01 something and you got a kid that's a
31:04 little bastard and a kid that's not the
31:08 kid that's a little bastard continues
31:09 beating up pretty much all the kids in
31:11 the room maybe grew just a little bit
31:14 more maybe his parents putting him in
31:16 there and he's way too old to be in
31:18 there what do you do as a daycare center
31:21 operator are a parent in that situation
31:24 do you wait for that kid
31:26 a pencil and jab it through some kids
31:28 eye removing their sight for the rest of
31:30 the life no you beat the little kids
31:32 [ __ ] ass right I mean you know you
31:34 spanked him you put him in a [ __ ]
31:37 room all by himself you take him and you
31:40 sent him home with his shitty parents
31:42 and so you deal with this kid he's not
31:44 gonna corrupt all these good kids who
31:45 actually have some genetic intelligence
31:48 not to [ __ ] do this
31:49 boom problem solved with ateva we're
31:54 sitting around messing around how many
31:58 times have you heard before Donald Trump
32:02 someone threatened the president's life
32:05 and not get a visit from the Secret
32:08 Service many times did that happen in
32:11 your lifetime in my estimation of my
32:15 entire 50 years on this planet I have
32:18 never heard someone publicly threatened
32:20 the president and just walk away never
32:23 ever ever I don't know if my life has
32:26 had in the last three years a single
32:29 month where I'm not hearing someone
32:30 publicly threatened Donald Trump's life
32:33 either in a music video a picture off at
32:38 some protest but it's happening
32:41 constantly yeah Tom marled got a visit
32:45 by the Secret Service for something he
32:46 posted hey I'm not hearing it you know
32:48 Snoop Dogg I'm not hearing Madonna I'm
32:50 not hearing my god Jeb Bush Robert
32:55 DeNiro Joe Biden both of which
32:58 threatened physical harm to the
32:59 president by saying the O ha they would
33:01 take him around back and punch him out
33:03 oh that would be a funny ass fight
33:05 wouldn't it we she wouldn't have to
33:07 knock Joe Biden's teeth out you just get
33:09 him talking a little bit and he'll fall
33:10 out so for my money we're waiting around
33:14 a lot longer than we should and we just
33:18 need to have some law enforcement that's
33:19 it that's it we already got laws on the
33:22 books you're not allowed to terrorize a
33:25 group of people right think about it
33:28 this way
33:29 if you had some creepy guy following you
33:33 around especially ladies you've run into
33:35 this most likely in your lifetime if
33:37 you're over 30 some guys following you
33:40 around falling
33:40 on campus fine you're on the grocery
33:41 store falling around the parking lot and
33:43 you just feel absolutely unsafe some
33:46 guys sending you text messages with
33:47 inappropriate content you know in 2019
33:52 you've got the right to go to the police
33:54 and identify this individual put a
33:56 police restraint order on them
33:58 restraining order and they can't get
34:00 next to you because they are threatened
34:03 all right this organization called
34:06 antifa they have demonstrated their MO
34:10 from the Berkeley University stuff to
34:12 all the stuff in Portland and Seattle
34:15 and all these different protests outside
34:18 of Trump's things they've all yelled you
34:22 know death to the police
34:24 death to Trump all this kind of stuff
34:26 felony felony felony assertions of
34:28 intent and motive to commit violent acts
34:32 and only recently are the police doing
34:35 anything
34:36 there's none even executive order about
34:38 masking yourself during a protest
34:41 okay protest all you want but we want to
34:43 know who you are
34:44 Hong Kong they know that all too well
34:47 they use green lasers and shoot it into
34:49 all the cameras or they saw that the
34:51 pull down and stomp on the camera but
34:53 what kind of [ __ ] enemy doesn't
34:55 identify themselves and in some weird
34:59 reverse sucking sound noise okay you
35:02 have normally a socialistic 1984 brave
35:09 new world government that is repressing
35:12 the people th x11 3:8 Logan's Run
35:17 running man you have these bizarre
35:20 worlds and the people act like an Tifa
35:24 because they want to have a do no harm
35:27 free market Republic that is you have an
35:31 eatable rights because you're alive and
35:33 no one can tell you any different the
35:37 hilarious unfortunate nature of antifa
35:41 is that you actually have completely
35:43 opposite you have the stupidest children
35:47 and people on earth trying to create the
35:51 global Big Brother state
35:53 protesting free market and freedom
35:56 yeah sure they're jealous that they
35:58 don't have enough brain cells to rub
36:00 together to create any money so they
36:02 obviously go after the 1% constantly
36:04 they're dying to be the 1% but they hate
36:07 that 1% until they're they are the 1%
36:10 you know how many people you walk up to
36:12 that have a dream to make a million
36:14 dollars or whatever the amount of money
36:16 is they think they're gonna have to
36:17 never work again you realize in
36:20 California if I gave you a million
36:21 dollars tax-free maybe you can live in
36:24 Southern California for eight years
36:26 without working you know and if you
36:29 could just invest it properly but you'd
36:32 if you invest you could lose it all in a
36:33 year you know that's not that much money
36:37 anymore
36:37 anyway everybody has a dream of making
36:39 money especially in these millennial
36:42 groups but they never talk about the
36:45 fact that there shouldn't want to do
36:47 anything that makes any money based on
36:49 their doctrine of no one should no one
36:51 should be rich now honestly the people
36:55 that I know that have made a tremendous
36:56 amount of money and didn't make that
37:00 their objective they simply did what
37:02 they loved and they made a ton of money
37:03 but what's interesting about them all is
37:06 that they never really spent any of the
37:08 money and it's almost as if they they
37:12 knew if they started spending that money
37:14 they would get potentially addicted to
37:16 that process and they're simply not
37:17 going to be enough but now imagine a lot
37:20 of the corruption is based on the
37:24 acquisition of money but again if you
37:27 know a bunch of rich people you there's
37:29 no disproportional happiness with people
37:32 with money versus people without there's
37:34 the same level of people that are
37:36 totally happy with no money as there are
37:38 people that hate not having money people
37:40 that are totally happy having money and
37:41 people that hate themselves even though
37:44 they have the money it's not like they
37:46 hate having money but I see it all the
37:48 time I see it all the time the big one
37:51 that is is pretty prevalent in Southern
37:55 California and what's interesting about
37:56 Southern California is I get this
37:58 extreme examples around me constantly
38:01 when it comes to a particular algorithm
38:05 of life such as
38:07 I'll go eat somewhere and I'll see some
38:11 guy pull up in a Bentley comes in and
38:16 maybe he's in shape usually they're not
38:17 they're older like we're talking late
38:21 50s mid 60s sort of thing and they're by
38:24 themselves no wedding ring oh my god
38:28 they've got a Piaget polo watch
38:31 they've got clothes on there's probably
38:33 $800 and it's just a jumpsuit couple
38:37 rings probably worth a couple hundred
38:38 grand if not a million dollars a pop but
38:41 what I'm not seeing on their face is
38:43 contentment and happiness I see
38:47 loneliness and I see pain well they're
38:51 gonna get back in their car
38:52 maybe maybe for a fleeting moment
38:55 someone gets impressed by the car until
38:58 they take a ride in it a couple times
39:00 and realize II you know you'll get a
39:03 young girl on occasion on occasion that
39:07 will fall for the possessions for a
39:09 little while he gives her the key she
39:12 drives him around a little bit but she
39:14 always has to come home to Grandpa and
39:17 so it wears off with the female side of
39:22 the equation it's a little bit different
39:23 but I see women dating really really
39:27 young guys the Cougars dating these
39:28 young kids in their 20s and their 30s
39:31 they're at least 20 30 years older and
39:34 again if they can make it work I bet
39:36 it's great but often times I see the
39:40 young guys they get in they have fun
39:42 with the money they have fun with some
39:43 possessions then they're out and it just
39:49 utterly destroys these folks so where is
39:53 this incredible world with money
39:57 where everyone's just happy here's your
40:00 million dollars you're just totally
40:01 cured it doesn't happen so part of the
40:06 corruption could getting could be
40:08 getting us to lusts for things that have
40:11 nothing to do with a well-balanced life
40:14 ask a hoarder who buys a bunch of stuff
40:19 constantly
40:19 and then just stacks it up in
40:21 house made of stuff mints your happy
40:23 hoarders would probably be the most
40:26 well-adjusted human beings and happy
40:29 people on planet Earth
40:30 there are 10,000 bags from Target you
40:33 know so in America we have a deep state
40:37 that is incredibly embedded in
40:39 government you know your it just so
40:43 happens I mean that it's easier to name
40:45 Democrats that are totally corrupt than
40:47 it is to name the Republicans that are
40:50 totally corrupt at this particular
40:51 Junction the other presidencies it's
40:56 been the inverse truth but it's
41:00 interesting when you take someone you
41:01 push them to their very physical limit
41:03 and in the case of the Democratic Party
41:08 in 2019 they have been pushed to their
41:10 intellectual and power thresholds Nancy
41:15 Pelosi can only convince people she is
41:19 telling the truth while she's telling a
41:21 lie for the folks that are dumber than
41:24 she is that is the only person you can
41:27 ever tell a lie to that will believe you
41:29 if someone that's dumber than you are
41:31 now that's not to get big you're not to
41:34 confuse someone who suspects you're
41:35 lying but they love you and they're
41:37 gonna just give you the benefit of the
41:39 doubt even though everything doesn't add
41:40 up
41:40 that's different that's a very smart
41:42 person but your atom shifts who lie
41:46 about absolutely everything and I mean
41:48 lie about what's in a transcript and the
41:50 transcript comes out and he looks just
41:51 like a complete piece of [ __ ] and they
41:53 just keeps doubling down the media out
41:57 there that is just the worst on planet
42:01 earth it's the worst it's ever been ever
42:04 the cognitive dissidence and utter
42:07 [ __ ] lies coming out of these folks
42:10 second-by-second it has never been more
42:13 corrupt and more untruthful than it is
42:19 in 2019 I seriously can't think of
42:21 anything worse than it is right now and
42:24 I'd have to say September 11th 2001 was
42:27 an epic moment of dispensing lies
42:33 but you know it's funny about it is I
42:35 actually believe that maybe we didn't
42:38 you know some journalists simply didn't
42:40 know that that was a complete bunch of
42:44 [ __ ] but they now know that what
42:49 we're wasting time doing in America is
42:53 complete [ __ ] and again I'm gonna
42:55 say this a few times because I want you
42:57 to think about it imagine you go to work
43:01 well you go to work let's just say I'm
43:04 willing to bet that you have to actually
43:06 accomplish something for you to get your
43:08 paycheck right you've got to do whatever
43:13 it is you do and then you get monitored
43:15 you have a certain quota you have to
43:21 accomplish if you're in accountant you
43:23 got to do so many jobs to get a paycheck
43:24 right the Democratic Party of the United
43:29 States of America since Donald Trump was
43:32 sworn into office to today October I
43:35 think it's 21st 2019 they have done
43:43 nothing for the American people and I
43:46 mean nothing but these piece of [ __ ]
43:50 humans are taking up to 225 thousand
43:54 dollars a year in straight-up cash but
43:59 they also get the best health care in
44:00 the world which is not the health care
44:02 they need one of us get and they are
44:05 able to push their kids through all
44:07 kinds of nepotistic opportunities you
44:13 know Joe Biden and his sons both getting
44:15 incredible amounts of money through
44:18 extortion ISM pay to play
44:21 Chelsea Clinton gets a near million
44:24 dollar a year job and then turns around
44:26 and says that she doesn't like this
44:28 country anymore hey get the [ __ ] out if
44:31 that's your [ __ ] opinion I think
44:34 anyone listening to my voice would love
44:36 to have your kid pop out of high school
44:38 slash college and get a million dollar a
44:41 year job and get to marry some big
44:42 powerful goldman sachs banker right
44:46 I mean most of us probably wouldn't but
44:47 you would at least want your kid to be
44:49 that successful we have such an aged
44:54 Congress and House of Representatives
44:56 that we have people going insane in
45:00 office presidential debates look like
45:04 look like an interview for a [ __ ]
45:07 hospice location I just saw this video
45:12 of Pelosi trying to give a speech it was
45:14 just a few weeks ago she is utterly
45:17 stuttering all over herself this is not
45:21 a doctored video in fact the other video
45:23 that they said was doctored was not
45:26 doctored as much as they say but this
45:29 one is just full-blown real time she's
45:32 going insane and she's the leader of the
45:35 house AOC is a goddamn MKULTRA [ __ ]
45:40 patient that aced her class right she
45:44 just came out with the spiraling
45:45 drooling eyeballs completely fraudulent
45:49 educational credentials I'll tell you
45:51 right now I'm just willing to bet that
45:52 if we did our investigation either well
45:57 I just don't I don't I don't buy it
45:59 you get you graduate the top of your
46:01 class but you can only become a
46:02 bartender nothing against bartenders but
46:05 Jesus you go up to a bartender gay do
46:07 you have an astrophysics degree no are
46:09 you a or aerospace no oh so you just got
46:12 a education like any one of us yeah okay
46:15 cool
46:15 that's why you're not a rocket scientist
46:18 or a congressperson I've always had this
46:21 vision of cleaning up corruption would
46:23 you go something like this when
46:26 everyone's corrupt in a particular
46:27 location or institution then the only
46:32 thing that sticks out like a black sheep
46:34 would be someone who was in corrupt so
46:39 maybe what you do is you slowly work
46:43 with individuals to say hey how do you
46:47 like having to bribe your way everywhere
46:49 you go in this country every every
46:51 business venture you do that this has
46:53 been a a pre-existing institution
46:57 created by a bunch of guys a long time

47:00 how would you like to just build your
47:02 house because you can build your house
47:04 so you get a little bit of buying the
47:07 buy-in spreads again corruption is a
47:10 tumultuous thing it shortens your life
47:13 it makes you stressed out but you keep
47:16 going and you keep Epping and again
47:18 we're here already this is what's
47:19 beautiful about the Great Awakening is
47:21 we're actually in the advanced stages of
47:23 d-cup ssin but what we want now what has
47:27 started to occur is that the corruptions
47:30 starting to stick out like a sore thumb
47:32 it is the black sheep I'm kind of
47:36 abusing the analogy of a black sheep I
47:37 understand but it sticks out like a sore
47:39 thumb it is something that is
47:41 immediately recognizable because we
47:43 don't want corruption to be the
47:46 predominant algorithm of society and I
47:50 think that's why we don't like dictators
47:54 to exist anywhere on planet Earth
47:56 because as soon as there's a dictator on
47:59 planet Earth that entire area of the
48:02 world can be corrupt everything that
48:07 goes on inside a dictatorship is
48:09 typically a corrupt institution but the
48:13 people have no say I have to say Donald
48:17 Trump was the first president in my
48:19 memory that actually committed during
48:21 his announcement speech to run for
48:23 presidency that he was going to return
48:25 the power to the people and then has
48:28 taken steps to unequivocally make that
48:32 happen
48:34 it's huge we know these bastards lie
48:37 about everything constantly we just say
48:40 whatever they want us you know I mean
48:43 Jesus just listened to the Democratic
48:46 debates the amount of [ __ ] these
48:49 people are doing they're literally
48:51 operating out of a playbook made when
48:53 John Denver had a top-ten hit on the
48:54 radio that's what Elizabeth Warren
48:57 reminds me of utterly utterly delusional
49:02 someone who lies about being Native
49:04 American and then it's just really funny
49:07 so an acquaintance of mine it was a
49:10 [ __ ] job in the world
49:13 who doesn't understand she has a
49:15 [ __ ] job in the world post this Pro
49:19 Elizabeth Warren thing and whatever you
49:22 do what you your feeble brain will tell
49:24 you was a good idea but I come up there
49:26 and I said was a big picture of her face
49:30 and I said boy you can really see those
49:32 Cherokee Indian features just subtly
49:36 reminding them you're painting for a
49:38 [ __ ] liar
49:39 that's your candidate for presidency is
49:42 a goddamn liar that not only lied about
49:44 being Native America and told a [ __ ]
49:46 story about her father being persecuted
49:49 because her mother or whatever was the
49:50 Native American or some horseshit story
49:52 that never turned out to be true but
49:55 then orchestrated a fake situation where
49:58 a genealogist had gotten her blood tests
50:00 back and said you're definitely Native
50:02 American and then she tests positive for
50:06 1000 24th
50:09 Peruvian Indian blood which means
50:12 basically there was a random match in
50:14 the world and this is someone's idea of
50:17 the best person that could run the
50:18 United States of America so let's look
50:21 at this she's got a [ __ ] job she's
50:23 in this VR thing VR so [ __ ] dead it
50:26 is unbelievable it is [ __ ] dead dead
50:29 dead she runs around a VR conferences
50:31 all all year long only human being on
50:34 planet earth because her company is so
50:37 [ __ ] antiquated they don't know where
50:39 the where the actual business is so
50:42 you're in a delusional state of not
50:45 working there's no I met this girl she
50:49 was in a swing inside this kind of
50:51 weworks joint right though intellectual
50:54 contribution to the to the story she's
50:57 gonna vote for Elizabeth Warren there
50:59 she gets nominated big [ __ ] surprise
51:02 right so this guy comes in to the
51:06 comment and says well what kind of
51:09 statement is that you know waited way to
51:12 contribute to the conversation jackass
51:14 just love to meet these people in real
51:17 life oh my god so now get this let's
51:21 just rule out the algorithm I'm a dick
51:23 because I remind this
51:26 [ __ ] [ __ ] that elizabeth warren's a
51:28 complete abject liar and that you're
51:31 choosing a [ __ ] liar to be the
51:33 president United States Joe Biden did
51:36 touches a bunch of little girls in a
51:38 c-span coverage over and over and over
51:41 again he's a candidate for presidency
51:47 unbelievable Harris Harris who's Jesse
51:51 smoothly A's aunt who makes a phone call
51:53 to get his ass out of jail because she's
51:56 gonna be running for president if they
51:58 ever figured out that they're related
51:59 she's gonna have credibility problems
52:01 because she's part of a piece of [ __ ]
52:03 family with just piece of shits down the
52:07 line right Bernie Sanders he's part of
52:10 the 1% trying to say that he shouldn't
52:12 exist I mean he says you know
52:14 billionaires shouldn't exist he's not a
52:15 billionaire but they did it's part of
52:16 the 1% how can you possibly [ __ ] vote
52:22 for someone who is part of the 1%
52:24 telling you that the 1% shouldn't exist
52:26 hey Bernie once you get rid of the
52:28 hundred and sixty thousand dollar outta
52:30 you bought after you got your payoff
52:32 check from the Hillary foundation for
52:35 letting her steal the election from you
52:37 in California God be 79 years old if it
52:41 gets into office I mean seriously were
52:44 the America bro
52:47 we're the United States of America and
52:48 we can't find anybody under [ __ ] 50 or
52:52 under 60 they could run this place give
52:54 me a break
52:55 the answer is no corruption it's in our
53:00 school systems it's in our corporations
53:02 it's in our government it comes from
53:06 outside in a lot of cases but we have
53:09 homegrown corruption you know the
53:12 educational system was you know co-opted
53:14 in early 70s by European communists
53:18 that's what the KGB guy out lines in his
53:21 1985 confession he was a KGB agent that
53:25 defected to United States and then just
53:27 told everybody what was going on and he
53:29 is the best most efficient Nostradamus
53:33 human we have ever had on video camera
53:37 everything he said either
53:39 was already in effect or has come to
53:42 fruition
53:43 we have corruption in our churches since
53:47 I've been in California you hear me
53:50 mention this every once in a while and
53:53 again I wasn't in to church much in the
53:55 Midwest I just talked about this just a
53:58 couple episodes back but we had a creepy
54:00 preacher that kept coming up to us again
54:03 I come to California I joined this
54:05 church first time I've ever been inside
54:08 of a church by my own free will
54:11 this dude son of the one of the elders
54:16 of the church and they're actually good
54:18 people he's a son-in-law accuses the
54:21 current youth minister of being creepy
54:24 with one of the girls who was over 18
54:27 the guy says you know I'm tired of this
54:29 [ __ ] I got a hot wife and two amazing
54:31 kids I don't need this [ __ ] [ __ ]
54:33 I'm out here so he leaves pushed out a
54:36 guy who was legit and a great man gets
54:40 charged with five counts of child
54:44 pedophilia and molestation one of the
54:48 charges was sodomizing with the foreign
54:50 object goes and gets his PhD at
54:55 Pepperdine University after becoming an
54:57 extremely failed embarrassing musician
55:00 so here is he's a bible thumping dude
55:03 with a PhD he manages to do a few years
55:06 of teaching there then they show up and
55:09 handcuff him go look him up it's a brown
55:12 haired dude he ends up doing two years
55:18 in prison for his five counts denies
55:21 absolutely everything okay there's my
55:25 first church experience pedophile right
55:27 there boom corruption homegrown
55:32 homegrown pervy corruption I come back
55:36 down to Los Angeles one of my closest
55:39 friends she was a brilliant photographer
55:41 has actually the same last name as I do
55:44 she had her daughter who was probably
55:49 eight or nine years old keep reporting
55:52 when she had to stand next to the
55:54 preacher this little bump or maybe a big
55:58 bump on an O was on her body and finally
56:02 you're like okay you just we're gonna
56:05 pay attention to you now and you just go
56:09 about your business at the church and
56:10 sure enough they found the preacher had
56:13 a Joe Biden fetish where he rubs his
56:16 junk on people through his pants just
56:18 stands next to you and bumps you guy
56:21 went to jail there you go there's your
56:25 religious institutions protecting
56:27 children school institutions I don't
56:30 know my one of my girlfriend's in high
56:32 school when I was actually out of high
56:34 school she was here in California she
56:37 was 18 she had the drama teacher you
56:40 know get busted but the teachers union
56:44 comes in to transfer him not to the
56:47 first school after molestation charge
56:50 but to the second school after
56:52 molestation charge they'd already
56:53 bounced him one time before and I talked
56:56 to my friends who were teachers and they
56:58 sit there and some of them go oh yeah
57:00 that just happens that's horrible that's
57:02 why the teachers union needs to be nuked
57:04 among other reasons but then I get with
57:08 other teachers that don't want to admit
57:09 that this kind of stuff occurs or
57:11 they've never heard of it or they can't
57:12 conceive of it and so they sit there and
57:14 defend the teachers union as if this
57:15 isn't occurring it occurs and I'm giving
57:20 them first-hand knowledge that's the
57:21 funny thing
57:22 I give first-hand knowledge I'm not
57:23 speculating whether or not this should
57:25 happen I had to take my girlfriend for
57:27 nine months to court to testify to give
57:31 affidavits right somewhere out there on
57:35 a shelf somewhere is my girlfriend at
57:37 the time changing her clothing I don't
57:41 know if she was nude I don't know I
57:42 never saw it but somewhere out there
57:44 some perv has probably got the video all
57:48 because of the teachers union who should
57:50 have busted the guy the very first time
57:51 he did it and this mark McDowell guy
57:54 only gets two years really only two
57:58 years because he denies that it's true
58:01 how convenient
58:04 five girls men and what's funny is I
58:08 didn't know the guy that well I mean you
58:10 know I didn't I didn't but all the the
58:13 men and young boys I guess that you know
58:16 what cuz I was really young probably
58:17 about fourteen and up it's about a half
58:22 a dozen of us guys and they grew up with
58:26 the guy they grew up in that church from
58:29 birth and so I was in the Bay Area I
58:32 moved away from Ventura a Camarillo area
58:36 so I went up north he gets busted while
58:38 I'm up there and I have all of the guys
58:42 from the church calling me and except
58:45 for his brother-in-law
58:46 of course saying oh my god can you
58:49 believe this can you believe this and I
58:51 knew this was the case and I knew it I
58:52 just didn't want to say you know no one
58:54 would have believed me and all this
58:55 other stuff unbelievable so one of the
59:00 very first things I'll say about getting
59:02 rid of corruption is that we as
59:05 individuals have to give up any type of
59:07 corruption that were involved in any
59:10 type of thing where we bend the rules
59:11 because that's just the way it is now of
59:16 course there's fine lines there I'm
59:18 gonna basically say without saying so
59:20 you can read between the lines I'm
59:22 really concerned more with your
59:24 treatment of another human being your
59:27 neighbor your loved ones your relatives
59:30 as long as they're decent to you give it
59:34 back now someone's a dick you can be
59:36 good for a little while but eventually
59:38 you just need to cut them out of your
59:39 life because that's just what they are
59:41 and they usually are fairly committed to
59:43 that defect and if they happen to change
59:47 their game and come back to you in a
59:48 really nice way then you can reintroduce
59:50 them into your life but life is so short
59:53 you've got to get rid of losers out of
59:55 your life you do people that want to
59:57 [ __ ] cheat and steal and try to get
59:58 [ __ ] for free [ __ ] lie about
60:00 everything in their life deflect those
60:02 people you know and if you think that
60:06 sounds a little harsh then why don't you
60:08 tell me what one year of your life is
60:10 worth and gold in diamonds what's a
60:15 decade worth of your life wasted hanging
60:17 out with
60:17 losers worth what's it worth can you not
60:21 do any better I bet you can not bet you
60:25 can find wonderful people so that
60:28 slippery slope of well you know I
60:30 cheated there I cheated there I cheated
60:31 there too there that [ __ ] grows man
60:33 it grows it's a habit man I just got
60:36 away with something man that was kind of
60:37 exciting and I didn't look how much
60:39 money I had because I didn't pay full
60:40 price for this or I stole this or I
60:42 cheated this thing yeah everything's a
60:47 muscle beware what you get good at it
60:50 because it'll catch up and you know to
60:54 steal and be able to sleep at night and
60:57 I'm not talking specifically about
60:58 stealing but being corrupt and and
61:00 sleeping at night eventually when you
61:04 wake up from the craziness if someone
61:09 actually notices to that loves you what
61:11 if you got married
61:11 and your husband or your wife doesn't
61:14 know you're committing all these you
61:16 know infractions on society maybe it's a
61:20 crime technically maybe it's just bad
61:24 behavior but if you're doing this
61:29 corruption you're gonna continually lie
61:30 to yourself that you're not or that
61:33 doesn't matter and then one day it all
61:36 comes crashing in like this mark
61:37 McDowell getting arrested
61:40 unbelievable unbelievable and the funny
61:45 thing about that dude was that at the
61:47 church his in-laws when I understand the
61:53 wife knows as a woman that five little
61:56 girls don't come out and say that they
61:58 got molested unless that really happened
62:00 they know but because they had two kids
62:03 two two daughters and one son but this
62:06 the husband went into complete [ __ ]
62:09 cognitive dissidence and believed that
62:11 these girls were just out to make him
62:15 make money I guess it's revolting to
62:19 think that it you know having raised a
62:22 girl myself they are there's always a
62:27 fragile stage in a girl's life where
62:29 again they don't want to be
62:31 perceived as damaged and to have them
62:35 muster up the courage to tell law
62:38 enforcement that this happened to sit in
62:40 a court behind a microphone sworn in
62:42 such that if you tell a lie you perjure
62:45 yourself which when your little man that
62:48 means a lot you know you got cops over
62:50 you with guns and [ __ ] and they say you
62:52 lie you're going to jail little kids
62:54 don't go well [ __ ] you man you know no
62:57 adults do that so have someone write the
63:00 guy a blank check it's like oh so you're
63:04 taking your trailer hitch with your soul
63:07 in it and you're attaching it to the
63:09 [ __ ] that's going straight down
63:10 you know to whatever black void exists I
63:14 don't think it's turn the other cheek
63:17 virtue I think it is enable a pedophile
63:21 to keep going show him he never has to
63:24 truly pay the price for what he does let
63:28 me know in the comments section the the
63:31 general areas of corruption that you
63:33 think are the most acidic you know for
63:38 me it's above all it's banking because
63:41 with banking you control all the other
63:43 areas of corruption but for down from
63:46 there you have again I would put the
63:48 goldman sachs in banking the
63:50 distribution of fake money is always
63:52 left to the investment banking houses
63:53 but the corrupt corporations like your
63:56 GES well i guess it's going out of
63:58 business or something you're really not
64:00 doing well and i say them because the
64:03 Brockovich thing right maybe at times
64:06 particular military institutions have
64:08 been very corrupt then of course local
64:12 law enforcement can be corrupt at times
64:15 I'm hoping that people dumping water on
64:20 cops doesn't create a whole nother
64:23 generation of police officers that are
64:25 going to be wholesale slaughtering
64:27 citizens whether they be guilty or not
64:30 of violating social mores you know it
64:35 does alarm me that a cop can put up with
64:39 something that otherwise would be
64:41 assaulting a police officer
64:44 that bothers me New York used to be
64:47 known for being you know the cops being
64:51 pro 911 you know pro neocon pro
64:55 globalists where if you said it was an
64:57 inside job or the physics don't work out
64:59 they're gonna try to arrest you or put
65:01 you in a freedom of speech zone that's
65:02 what they were in 2001 and now it's been
65:06 so cleaned out you could dump a [ __ ]
65:07 bucket of water on a cop in from New
65:09 York and they walk away was the guy in a
65:12 swimsuit totally naked otherwise you
65:15 pose a threat to you men I don't get it
65:18 I don't get it but your local
65:22 politicians you know they're usually
65:25 built out of amazing individuals or
65:27 complete corrupt scumbags that know
65:29 where to hide to get a full pension
65:33 apparently if you become a federal judge
65:37 you only have to serve five years an
65:41 appellate court or something like that
65:43 and you get 100% benefits for the rest
65:46 of your life you imagine that so you go
65:49 get a pension out of being a federal
65:51 judge then you run for Congress and do
65:54 your two to six years then you get a
65:58 full pension from that you're set for
66:01 life man well if you haven't been to
66:04 deep thoughts radio Calm please go I'll
