00:29 good evening ladies and gentlemen so
00:34 today as you can see we're gonna talk
00:36 about Liars which might initially sound
00:39 kind of boring but for the normal
00:43 listeners I think you know that
00:45 regardless of what I'm gonna get into I
00:47 try to make it as interesting as
00:48 possible and there's always a reason
00:50 okay here's the cool thing about deep
00:53 thoughts it is extremely difficult to
00:56 make a to make a really bad topic and
00:59 talk about it for an hour plus right
01:01 it's very very difficult so I won't pick
01:04 something that I feel like only has a
01:06 ankle deep you know dive into the
01:09 intellect of mankind it's it's really
01:12 interesting the whole subject of liars
01:14 because I have dealt with some mega
01:17 [ __ ] liars in my lifetime there's
01:19 your f-bomb really quick in for free I
01:21 think this episode is gonna have value
01:24 because we're going to talk about some
01:25 major archetypes of people that tell
01:27 lies both from a personal standpoint and
01:32 on a business standpoint and then
01:35 perhaps the ones that are much much
01:37 higher which are outside of our our
01:40 personal circles of influence which
01:43 would be politicians fake scientists all
01:47 these kind of folks to institutions that
01:50 are building up lore like NASA but I
01:55 want to go after the personal ones first
01:58 because this is where usually we have
02:01 the highest count unfortunately of
02:05 encountering Liars because they have
02:07 incredible mechanisms in their brains
02:12 such that they can do it pathologically
02:16 sometimes right and I know that you guys
02:18 will have similar experiences you'll
02:20 have completely different experiences
02:24 which still match some of these
02:25 archetypes
02:27 but it's interesting because when you're
02:29 young you know the people lie it happens
02:33 it's kind of a bummer when it first
02:35 happens now it depends on how you're
02:37 looking at this if your parents are
02:39 telling you Santa Claus is real and
02:41 you're getting presents out of the game
02:43 telling you tooth fairy exists you
02:45 little money out of the game yeah you're
02:47 not gonna hold anyone you know in a
02:50 lower echelon in your life as far as
02:52 evaluation because of those kind of
02:56 things so I'm not talking about that
02:57 we're talking about devious level one
03:02 through ten you know yours truly has not
03:07 made a life out of telling lies I tell
03:11 stories but then again I'm selling
03:13 fiction so there it is right in your
03:15 face right but a lie is something I just
03:19 really have had a problem ever accepting
03:23 into my fabric it's just even before I
03:26 had a deep faith in God it just didn't
03:30 work for me it was like there was no
03:33 reason to I could get what I wanted in
03:35 life without having to to tell lies and
03:38 any time I tried to dabble in fibs as a
03:40 kid it just it probably made me feel
03:44 like it's really hard for me to think
03:47 about when I have fibbed to like my
03:50 parents or something because I would
03:53 always arrange my life in a way that I
03:54 would never be asked a question that I
03:56 had to lie about even if it was
03:57 something I shouldn't have done that's a
04:00 whole different thing you know I think I
04:02 told you guys that when I was about nine
04:05 I started shoplifting with some friends
04:07 of mine got with two brothers that were
04:10 just they were just bad news man they we
04:13 had a good time
04:14 but from about the age of 9 to 13
04:17 I would shoplift just just for the high
04:21 of it like a klepto you know I didn't
04:24 any money so it wasn't like I was rich
04:25 in doing it but it was the bubble gum
04:29 and the biggest jewelry some pins and
04:33 pencils and and supplies for art so
04:37 dozens from my school a lot of times
04:38 from department stores like what is
04:41 considered to be like a target today
04:42 there was a TG and why in the Midwest
04:45 just like a target and you know stuff
04:48 would disappear once well car models was
04:50 the biggest thing ever really stole I
04:53 was 13 I went back to Kansas and my
04:58 cousin said I don't believe you can take
04:59 anything out of this store he's got
05:01 mirrors everywhere tell us once before
05:04 but that's okay picking the one not too
05:08 big right he picks a padlock and I'm
05:11 looking at the mirrors and the mirrors
05:12 are helping me because there's no video
05:14 cameras and so looking in she just helps
05:16 a customer and pocketed it and we walked
05:19 down and I gave it to him I said here
05:20 and he was just so blown away then he
05:22 went and tried to steal something
05:23 immediately gets caught he's still
05:25 something big and he comes you know
05:26 comes home with this toy forgot the hell
05:28 it was his parents like where the hell
05:29 did you get this so I found it in the
05:30 ditch is what he said
05:31 will you go brother I went back to
05:34 Massachusetts where I was living and
05:39 they took a pack of like C batteries for
05:43 something I owned and I felt so bad when
05:46 I walked out I was like I'm never doing
05:48 this again and I never did it never did
05:54 but lies and Liars hmm some people live
06:02 for the same reason that I used to
06:04 shoplift can you get away with it so you
06:07 tell lie all right a little bit of a
06:11 novelty I'm you know I think that a lot
06:15 of people will not do it that way I'm
06:19 willing to bet that at least a fair
06:20 percentage of those folks cease lying
06:23 for the same reason I see shoplifting
06:25 they got another system they tested it
06:28 yeah they're pretty good at it the boy
06:30 once you get something probably as a
06:31 gain from lying
06:34 I imagine that might become really
06:36 addictive well I got something for free
06:37 that I wasn't supposed to have whoo
06:41 maybe I can continue like skimming on
06:43 the side here maybe it's for money maybe
06:46 it's for something else but I can
06:49 imagine it getting really addictive for
06:51 these people
06:53 and then you have your you know it
06:56 starts to divide because once you
06:57 develop the skill said then it's like
06:59 what you gonna do what that skill set
07:00 what if I turn into a bank robber
07:02 because I don't know
07:04 shoplifting got so good or I straight
07:05 steal in my cars or something because
07:07 hey man it was it was easy stealing this
07:09 little thing just keep challenging
07:11 myself so imagine that Liars could go
07:14 that route too it's like but I just
07:16 don't lie about little tiny things here
07:17 and there to keep my relationship really
07:19 solid she asked me if she looked fat in
07:21 that dress and I was like honey you look
07:24 so hot bah bah bah make another kid
07:26 right but I think it's a super duper
07:29 slippery slope as I always say you teach
07:32 your mind to technology and man you got
07:35 to be careful but I have noticed over
07:39 the years that Liars have very
07:41 interesting defense mechanisms and
07:42 that's where it gets really interesting
07:43 to me because just telling a lie and
07:45 talking about bad lies versus you know
07:48 White Lies versus really intense lies
07:50 know what the other color might be but a
07:52 really intense lie yeah I could get
07:55 boring pretty fast we all know how that
07:56 works what I've experienced is a couple
08:02 different pieces to a lie to a liar
08:04 right now again lying at a citizen level
08:10 to another citizen like it to a friend
08:13 or do some loved one or something has a
08:15 whole different in my opinion
08:17 in my experience I should say technology
08:20 that they develop in their brains as to
08:22 why they do it how they do it how they
08:24 can live with themselves and then
08:26 continue doing it and then you have the
08:29 you know you're neil degrasse tyson liar
08:31 you're Neal Bill Nye the douche bag guy
08:34 liar
08:35 you know Greta is totally different she
08:38 probably doesn't even know what planet
08:39 she's on but you know you're Nancy
08:42 Pelosi who's been able to amass over 200
08:45 million dollars in shady things those
08:49 are different kind of liars
08:50 you have your pedophiles like Adam
08:52 Schiff and Bill Joe Biden excuse me and
08:55 they're they're having to hide their
08:58 lust circles so they're into it on a
08:59 whole different level than any of our
09:01 friends our hope to God right we don't
09:03 need friends like that
09:04 but the brain of a liar a consummate
09:08 liar the pathological liar is a lot
09:11 different than just an average little
09:14 fib here and there the two things I've
09:18 noticed is that one the liar has a
09:23 rationale machine it's almost like the
09:27 economy of their lie let's say they want
09:30 to tell a medium-sized light at level 5
09:33 lie well in their brain they need to
09:36 generate an economy to pay for that lie
09:39 what do I mean by that well I lied to
09:43 you because you did this to me you made
09:46 me mad so I lied to you or you know
09:50 there's a little bit difference where
09:51 someone's got a gun to your head and
09:53 saying to you like you know apple pie if
09:56 you don't I'm gonna blow your brains out
09:57 and you're like [ __ ] I love apple pie
09:58 like crazy that's a little different
10:00 right people had to do that and time
10:02 over you know centuries of like do you
10:04 like Jesus Christ do you believe he
10:05 really existed the guys they're like I
10:06 never saw him but yet totally you got me
10:09 on the day in the iron meeting you know
10:12 which is probably a fictitious torture
10:14 machine or whatever try to stretch you
10:17 out on some table like Princess Bride
10:20 but I've had people love dated of one
10:24 particular person who if you made her
10:28 mad for any reason whatsoever
10:30 she rationalize cheating leave me mad so
10:34 I cheated oh okay because that's that's
10:37 what everybody does right that's one in
10:39 the same right very interesting the same
10:43 person invented a technology that I've
10:45 never seen before which is imagine
10:49 here's a seven day period and let's just
10:53 say Monday and Tuesday
10:55 you were told something was going to
10:58 occur they committed to you for some
11:01 reason for something who knows you're
11:04 supposed to eat dinner maybe they're
11:05 supposed to do something for you
11:06 and they don't and so you're kind of
11:10 like you know sometimes these things can
11:12 be huge within a relationship right and
11:16 you're kind of like
11:17 why didn't you do that why'd you lie
11:19 why'd you lie about being here but
11:21 you're actually there I don't know I'm
11:24 sorry that was really bad at me you're
11:26 like okay well people are human that's
11:27 kind of dude I am I'm sort of a sucker
11:29 for some of that stuff then it comes to
11:32 like Friday let's say that's the end of
11:35 the week for us and then you start
11:39 seeing certain behaviors that are sort
11:41 of them indicating maybe you're in a
11:44 truth zone maybe you're in a lie zone
11:47 and so you start to you know lose a
11:51 little bit of your patience right and
11:55 say you're like oh man you're doing it
11:57 again you're doing again right here this
11:59 isn't true why are you doing that again
12:01 and then they're like oh uh oh I'm not
12:04 doing that you know but they are and
12:06 then you let them have it you let you
12:08 express yourself you're like this is
12:10 [ __ ]
12:11 why are you doing that and of course you
12:13 might use some language you would
12:15 normally use you might get hot like you
12:17 normally wouldn't get in the someone's
12:19 telling you a lie right and this person
12:23 would do this chronology lie mechanism
12:27 in the brain they would essentially talk
12:32 back to you and one to a race would just
12:36 happen on Monday and Tuesday
12:37 this pattern of deception they don't
12:41 want to acknowledge that they are
12:43 pathological liars so they would talk to
12:45 you as if they had never lied to you
12:47 before
12:47 as if they're not the boy that called
12:49 Wolfe we're all standing out there in
12:52 the middle of night looking for a wolf
12:53 and there's no wolf and they're like
12:54 like why do you keep saying there's a
12:56 wolf man well you guys you know I
12:59 thought there was one well no you said
13:00 on Monday and Tuesday there was a wolf
13:02 and there wasn't what are you talking
13:03 about you know they don't acknowledge it
13:05 they erase it it's a very strange thing
13:09 now the end the other interesting thing
13:11 about lies is that once you tell a lie
13:12 it feeds into an action typically right
13:15 what did you lie about well you stole
13:19 something okay so the lies that you
13:22 bought this but you didn't so that's the
13:24 lie now what we gain from that is that
13:27 now you're a thief right
13:29 you said you were at
13:31 but you're actually sleeping with
13:32 somebody else well now your cheater you
13:35 get these other labels as a result of
13:38 lying a lot of cases right it's not just
13:42 that you're a liar you're gaining other
13:44 deceitful patterns in your life so then
13:48 I've noticed with the same individual
13:52 that if I say you know back then you you
13:56 know you're cheater
13:58 you got the cheater gene that's what you
14:01 do you rationalize it however you can
14:03 with your first mechanism you upset one
14:06 evening instead of bringing that
14:08 situation to a head in a conversation
14:11 you know when you're upset you need to
14:14 let the other person know that they've
14:15 upset you and you talk it out to figure
14:18 out where the miscommunication was all
14:21 right but now here's the interesting
14:23 thing if you recall a thief a thief
14:26 sometimes they'll say well why do you
14:29 gotta call me names I think you're like
14:32 well I'm not saying that today you were
14:35 a thief I'm just saying that you've
14:37 stolen a lot of crap in your lifetime
14:39 and you're kind of a little thief now
14:42 if someone had called me a thief at
14:44 right after I turn in my 14th birthday I
14:47 think I stole those batteries in the mmm
14:49 spring of of my 13th year my birthday's
14:55 in August so it's like you might say
14:57 like am i stole those batteries I don't
14:59 remember when I did it
15:00 but if you call me a thief when I was
15:03 just 14 a few months later I really
15:05 couldn't say much because it was like
15:07 yeah I guess I kind of am I need to stop
15:09 that I need to never be that again so
15:11 that I can say you know what I was that
15:13 really sorry about that wrong with me to
15:16 do that but I've like had you know I've
15:20 been reborn and I've done a new thing
15:22 I've talked to some listeners who were
15:25 very very how do I say this I think they
15:31 were very heroic in telling me the lies
15:36 that they've endured and one of the so
15:39 there's two there's two binding
15:41 mechanisms between us and other human
15:42 beings that allows lies
15:45 to occur more than once because in a lot
15:49 of social circles and a lot of people's
15:50 lives they say you lie one time you're
15:52 out hmm
15:54 I actually don't I completely understand
15:58 that and I actually kind of totally
16:00 support it
16:01 I do give someone a second chance and
16:05 there's probably defect in me when
16:08 you're in love with someone you're bound
16:10 to them right the other mechanism is
16:12 you're in a business with them okay so
16:16 that's another thing that can happen so
16:18 now you're if you're in love with
16:22 someone you're usually trying to build a
16:23 relationship right you're trying to
16:24 build a family not depending how old you
16:27 are or if nothing else you're past your
16:29 childbearing years and now you're just
16:31 trying to build a nice little nest
16:33 together you know some I love you you
16:36 love me
16:36 and we're gonna sleep next to each other
16:37 2 warm bodies and the winter time is a
16:39 hell of a lot better than sleeping by
16:40 yourself sharing a dinner with some
16:43 one's way better watching a comedy what
16:45 the hell is the point of watching a
16:47 funny movie completely by yourself
16:48 it sucks you laugh and you're like it's
16:52 in the room with you right okay we're in
16:56 a business ah that's a little more
16:59 intense a business is almost the
17:01 equivalent of taking that relationship
17:02 to a marriage you have a contract now
17:05 there's legal ramifications if you
17:07 divorce you get to keep everything you
17:09 brought into the marriage in California
17:11 but you have to split everything that
17:13 you gained after the marriage unless you
17:15 have a prenuptial agreement hmm well the
17:19 business can run very similar you're now
17:22 in a contractual business entity that
17:25 has shares let's just keep it real
17:27 simple there's two shares to the company
17:29 you have one share and your partner has
17:31 the other share 50/50 down the middle
17:34 it's one of the most naive things that
17:36 new business owners and I have been
17:38 there a couple times get into the
17:42 participation in a company is almost
17:44 never remotely 5050 from the very
17:48 beginning as much as you might be
17:50 delusional
17:51 about that
17:52 it's not and I've got episodes in season
17:57 one which you're gonna deep thoughts
17:59 radio calm that and click on the season
18:01 one link and look up business and you'll
18:03 find it or just go to the website and
18:04 click on and I'll get you right to it
18:06 but I really go over I'm starting a
18:09 business
18:10 now all the gotchas but I give you you
18:13 know some of the preview highlights as
18:15 it relates to Liars because this is
18:17 where your life gets wasted right when
18:23 you have a liar in your life they waste
18:25 every second of your life that you're
18:27 with them because they don't really have
18:30 any intent of helping you with your
18:34 vision of what a family might be what a
18:36 business could be because they're
18:38 fibbing about their participation their
18:41 dedication to the institution of the
18:43 whole thing obviously it happens on
18:45 friendship levels friendships can come
18:47 and go and you're not exactly as
18:50 devastated why are you staying out with
18:51 that guy but he was always lying about
18:53 something
18:54 now I'm fairly fortunate that most my
18:56 friends are just like me and they'll
19:00 even go to the extent of like kicking
19:01 someone out of their fern circle when
19:04 they find out they're lying to someone
19:05 else and then talking about it and
19:08 they're like really and they just don't
19:10 invite the person anymore because they
19:12 don't want a liar in in the the clan
19:15 right
19:15 I shouldn't say clan we're made of all
19:18 races trust me but in a business
19:22 partnership well the most common lies is
19:24 I'm gonna do my share of the work now
19:29 what's interesting about it is is that
19:31 you can get a liar into your business
19:33 who's just going to play you from day
19:35 one happens way more than you think
19:41 because they're predatory elite trying
19:43 to get into businesses with people that
19:45 will find money thus paying their bills
19:48 giving them a lifestyle and then they
19:53 just participate a little bit at the
19:55 beginning and the funny thing is is a
19:57 lot of these people are extremely
19:58 talented and could easily participate at
20:00 50% if not more but they're lazy and the
20:04 lazy because they're liars
20:06 being a lazy person often will kick off
20:10 a lying regimen of life because in order
20:13 to be lazy depending on your you know
20:16 your welfare maybe you got tons of cash
20:18 and being lazy it's just your goal life
20:20 there's nothing wrong with that
20:21 whatsoever in fact I think that's a lot
20:23 of people's goals but a lot of lazy
20:26 people want stuff free and so they'll
20:30 say anything to get it could be that
20:33 someone has been very integral their
20:35 entire life and they get tired they get
20:37 injured they can't do things that they
20:39 used to to make money or to get what
20:41 they want so they start lying just to
20:44 survive mm-hmm sometimes that's
20:47 something we can understand the homeless
20:49 person getting the sandwich off some
20:51 someone through a lie or it could be
20:54 someone they could definitely still get
20:56 a sandwich but they're still gonna lie
20:57 about it something and get one sandwich
20:59 being a metaphor for something that they
21:01 won but in a business Liars know a lot
21:05 about the horrible situation that
21:09 they've croute that they're going to
21:10 create in a business which is the other
21:12 partner is going to soon realize that
21:14 that person is not participating in 50
21:17 percent and there's two ways it usually
21:20 goes a very common method is that person
21:23 who's not participating who is the liar
21:24 well lie that they are participating or
21:28 they'll have lies of why they're not
21:30 participating but it's a good one right
21:31 my grandmother died I mean I just like
21:35 guts not feeling great or you know I had
21:37 a headache or whatever they got all
21:38 these things all lined up and they've
21:40 used them several times in other
21:42 circumstances maybe in a business
21:44 relationship maybe just in life but
21:46 that's like their go-to lies you know
21:49 how many times in movies have you seen
21:51 the they're heard the line about you
21:53 know his grandmother's died 10 times
21:55 this year that's one of those situations
21:58 right in a relationship typically what
22:03 it is is that the person who's a liar is
22:05 someone that can't be tied down right
22:08 commitment isn't really part of their
22:10 wheelhouse but they do like sleeping
22:13 next to someone regularly how many times
22:16 you've you heard the
22:18 it men can't get away with it that often
22:21 which is why I'm gonna give a male to
22:23 female the male thing but a lot of times
22:26 you know you know guys go out and work
22:30 all the time this is probably like an
22:31 analogy that would be very indicative
22:33 say 35 years ago at least when men were
22:36 typically the chief breadwinner just by
22:39 design not because women couldn't women
22:42 actually have always earned more than
22:43 men if they don't have kids always 10%
22:45 more than men every time if they
22:47 dedicate themselves straight out of
22:48 college to a career they make more money
22:51 see dr. Saul well for the facts on that
22:55 but they want to sleep around they want
23:00 to stay young and in their line sleeping
23:02 with multiple people means they're young
23:03 because they're their desired right now
23:07 men are typically more revered the more
23:10 their hair gets gray and where they grow
23:12 a beard he's long as they don't get a
23:13 huge pop belly but I know some women
23:15 think if I ever gain any way to be like
23:17 I like you with little more pounds on
23:19 you really you know I'm okay if you like
23:23 that but I don't want to I'm gonna get
23:24 heavy for you you know it was typically
23:27 because they want something more than
23:30 what the the confines are in a business
23:33 situation the partner doesn't want to
23:35 work that much they want to sit back and
23:37 and have this vision of themselves being
23:40 successful I'm a partner in a successful
23:43 business when it comes down to actually
23:46 spending 14 hours or more on a
23:48 particular day crunching some stuff to
23:50 get stuff done
23:51 not so much I've had all kinds of
23:55 business partners in my lifetime in all
23:58 cases in my life actually excuse me one
24:02 case went really bad okay but in my
24:06 close friends that I've done businesses
24:07 with we're all starting out doing really
24:10 well and we were able to complete a
24:11 fairly significant amount of the work
24:14 without you know ever slacking off I've
24:18 had a partner
24:19 my last partner he and I worked at the
24:21 very last day together nothing we would
24:24 do for each other time before that I had
24:28 a partner that worked really really well
24:30 for about four years
24:33 and in the fifth year he had some
24:35 personal issues and he had some other
24:37 desires in life which were just fine but
24:39 he didn't communicate that to anyone and
24:41 so he started saying that he was working
24:44 12 hours a day on certain client
24:47 projects of which then I got contacted
24:50 by the client saying hey my thing hasn't
24:51 moved forward at all I have not no dive
24:53 received no tangibles from your company
24:55 I want my money back
24:57 I'm like well that's weird it must be
25:00 just a miscommunication here and I go
25:03 back well why are we getting in a
25:06 request for refund this never happened
25:08 in history of our company and I get some
25:12 story they've come to find out the guy
25:14 wasn't working at all he had burned
25:17 himself out and never told anyone but he
25:20 couldn't risk losing his paycheck
25:22 because he wasn't producing just prior
25:28 to that we had a situation in that same
25:31 person where he was supposed to do most
25:34 of the work and we had a.m. we had a
25:39 $75,000 gig for some work that was
25:42 really easy to do and when we asked him
25:45 how much is it gonna actually cost us to
25:47 do the work he claimed it was not gonna
25:51 cost his $25,000 to do the work and we
25:53 were in a net 50 it's like whoa that's
25:56 pretty amazing
25:59 turns out it was 50 thousand dollars he
26:02 hired it all out he paid one of his
26:04 friends a hundred and sixty thousand
26:07 sixty dollars an hour scuse me which is
26:10 a massive massive deep six digit salary
26:13 right you didn't do any of the work but
26:17 we got back from that person was utterly
26:18 useless I never let the clients see at
26:21 once because it was so embarrassing but
26:24 we paid 50 grand same guy hired an
26:28 agency in South America 60 grand said
26:31 we're gonna get a bunch of stuff for it
26:33 code came back
26:35 absolutely unusable company in South
26:37 America was a fraud to begin with 60
26:40 grand gone so I've been happening a lot
26:43 longer than we knew
26:46 because we did this trust game instead
26:48 of a show me the money kind of game
26:50 which means show me the work you've done
26:52 which then immediately you know the
26:54 bummer is if you don't start your
26:56 company off in a very visible
26:59 transparent way these people get to do
27:02 what they do
27:03 just remember Liars lie and so what I am
27:06 seeing a lot online are folks debating
27:12 the truth of someone like a Neil
27:14 deGrasse Tyson I see it all the time and
27:16 they'll they'll be surprised that he's
27:19 telling a new lie and I'm saying folks
27:24 Liars lie so once someone elects
27:29 themselves to be a liar in your in your
27:31 circle the influence whether they be
27:34 external to you or just right next to
27:36 you that's it you really have to just
27:39 cut them loose so you can be their
27:41 friend but you never ever rely on them
27:43 you never trust them anything that they
27:46 say so if they say I'm gonna be there at
27:47 5 o'clock me they don't exist I mean
27:50 like they're not even in your plans ok
27:52 well if you do show up I guess that'll
27:54 be ok but if you're gonna leave at 5
27:57 o'clock and they said they're gonna be
27:58 there to meet you you don't make plans
28:00 for them to be there you just say oh
28:02 well you know what don't meet me in my
28:03 house want you to meet me where we're
28:05 going because I don't [ __ ] trust you
28:07 men right I had a girlfriend she worked
28:11 for a big software company in Silicon
28:13 Valley
28:14 she had a co-worker that was I guess her
28:16 superior when she got there and
28:19 unfortunately this has a race element to
28:22 it but it was a woman who wasn't white
28:24 and she was working for the company and
28:29 my girlfriend kept coming home saying
28:31 you know I'm not sure this woman is
28:33 doing anything you know it's not my
28:35 she's my boss it's not my position to
28:38 question her or anything like that so we
28:40 just you know just talked about every
28:41 once in a while well it turns out but
28:44 her boss's boss finally said where's
28:47 your work because so-and-so is turning
28:50 all her work underneath you but I'm not
28:52 seeing your work
28:54 immediately this woman files a racial
28:58 discrimination case against the company
29:01 immediately files a lawsuit against the
29:03 company for $100,000 in 1992 or three
29:08 which is a ton of cash people all right
29:13 so it almost went through it almost got
29:16 processed until some attorney at that
29:18 company decided to do a background check
29:21 on this woman so she said she had a
29:24 degree and she said that she had worked
29:26 for Microsoft and a previous job so the
29:30 guy goes to Microsoft and says you know
29:33 to HR and she says you know they said do
29:35 you mind if we ask you a question about
29:37 this woman because we just had a racial
29:40 lawsuit put up against us she barely
29:43 interacts with anyone there's no one
29:44 really telling her anything to do she's
29:46 just autonomous I don't know where she's
29:48 getting this idea and they said oh her
29:52 yeah well she sued us for the same thing
29:55 mmm really okay still not conclusive
30:00 maybe you know she's had some bad luck
30:02 well we pretty sure she didn't have any
30:05 racial discrimination where she was
30:06 currently serving so then they said she
30:09 says she has a degree at this College
30:11 and I don't know what school was so they
30:14 called the college and said you know
30:15 we're validating some credentials here
30:17 this woman says she has a degree
30:20 computer science he may have been like a
30:23 masters or something they said oh no she
30:26 dropped out before she ever got her
30:28 degree at all ah
30:30 now she's filed false credentials to get
30:34 both jobs one at Microsoft and wanted
30:37 this other company I don't know
30:39 Microsoft was never able to go back and
30:40 get their money back
30:41 you know wouldn't be any money to get
30:43 back anyway but this company in Silicon
30:46 Valley you know I don't know they they
30:50 reverse the electricity on this woman
30:52 and shocked her the other way Liars lie
30:56 Liars sometimes create these scenarios
31:00 what they're what they're extremely good
31:03 at right so we have to be careful
31:07 now governments lie don't they hmm why
31:13 do governments lie well there's two
31:17 basic types of lies that governments do
31:19 because there's probably every
31:21 conceivable lie species within a
31:24 government for sure one of them is that
31:27 they've committed a crime somewhere they
31:29 fought a war in a way that they weren't
31:30 supposed to fight maybe they even faked
31:32 the initiation of a war like Pearl
31:35 Harbor or the Gulf of Tonkin Pearl
31:38 Harbor occurs but it was instigating
31:41 gulf of tonkin never occurred hmm both
31:45 events both gulf of tonkin they're
31:47 supposed to be two events they're
31:48 neither one of them happened so they got
31:53 people killed tons of them and that's a
31:57 problem for the citizens to trust their
31:59 government and so they create movie
32:01 after movie after movie I just watched a
32:03 great Pearl Harbor movie about sorry was
32:08 about a Midway the service Pearl Harbor
32:10 and then the Midway I can't remember the
32:11 name of it because it was running when I
32:13 went in the room at the lounge but it's
32:16 actually a pretty cool movie just got
32:18 Woody Harrelson in if you want to look
32:20 up the IMDB on that camera what it was
32:21 called so gotta cover that up that's to
32:27 cover up a crime hmm now our aren't all
32:30 lies for the government crimes well I
32:32 would say yes one of the second types of
32:39 lies the government's tell is to protect
32:41 a nefarious project within the cut with
32:44 in the country MKULTRA a mind
32:48 controlling experiment m'kay mind
32:53 control controls well with a K because
32:56 the German scientists that were smuggled
32:58 out of Germany after the war through
33:00 Project Paperclip by the Dulles brothers
33:03 wanted to continue this string of
33:07 research they were doing to create
33:09 compartmentalization inside the human
33:11 mind to store information into store
33:13 triggers that then by using a key word
33:18 turn a person into what they call a
33:19 Manchurian Candidate made famous by the
33:21 movie with the same name to make him do
33:23 something like sirhan sirhan shooting in
33:26 the room with RFK didn't kill RFK but he
33:30 was the Patsy alright
33:34 claiming it's a matter of national
33:37 defense
33:38 you can hide anything it was another
33:43 type of lie that when we talk about all
33:46 the time which I call lower building
33:50 NASA lying about going to the moon now
33:55 there's a couple different thoughts even
33:57 if you do agree with me that we didn't
33:59 go do you have the story that we really
34:04 did try to go but we just couldn't get
34:06 the technology together we tried now
34:10 some people in the room who were
34:11 probably extremely smart thought not
34:15 with this technology you know unless
34:17 some unless we get to what I put on
34:19 paper like a von Braun saying look we
34:20 need a rocket the size of the Empire
34:22 State Building if we're gonna launch
34:24 from Earth's surface to get to them when
34:26 you need a massive Rockets which is why
34:28 he proposed what you saw in 2001 a Space
34:31 Odyssey
34:31 he proposed that 1956 which is what
34:34 while Disney animated for him and they
34:36 both presented it on TV you build a
34:38 space station you Faro uh fuel from our
34:43 surface to the space station you build a
34:45 space ship just like Star Trek in this
34:46 little space Bay and then you launch
34:49 from space to the moon that made more
34:52 sense but why did we keep why does the
34:56 government keep that light going well
34:59 because America is the only country
35:01 that's ever stepped foot on the moon and
35:04 come back safely we've never done it
35:06 since 1972 there's lies about it
35:09 happening again but they've already
35:11 delayed the project for years from 24
35:13 2024 or 2028
35:15 okay makes us superior doesn't it
35:21 China has a saving face slide that it's
35:23 probably going on right now and then you
35:25 know I I don't have real data so I don't
35:28 know if there's any good rationale for
35:31 it
35:32 Wuhan coronavirus suddenly shows up now
35:36 again could be something that they did
35:38 at what markets could be something that
35:40 was dropped on them but it was actually
35:42 discovered in December I think December
35:45 19th was the first case the guy that
35:46 blew the whistle on it's not dead he
35:49 just died this morning or yesterday
35:50 horrendous now they've got 50 we got 11
35:54 million people quarantined supposedly 50
35:56 for the whole country but 11 million
35:58 people in one are now stuck in their
36:02 houses spreading the virus to all their
36:04 family members if you are sick you're
36:07 not allowed to go to the hospital so
36:08 what would be easily treatable is not
36:10 killing you some people say that numbers
36:13 are on 25,000 fatalities with over 160
36:17 infected it's bad news so China doesn't
36:22 want to lose face but now the World
36:24 Health Organization which we don't
36:26 exactly trust in this world is trying to
36:27 say hey if you lie about all these
36:29 numbers you could cause what we call a
36:31 pandemic well I think China is saying
36:35 not really because we shut down our
36:38 travel outside the country a lot of
36:41 airlines in the longer fly into China so
36:44 we're dealing with our mess yes the
36:48 numbers might be really really high but
36:49 we're not going to cause a pandemic
36:50 because no one's allowed to travel
36:51 outside the country who have this virus
36:54 so let's hope that whatever strategy
36:58 they've picked is going to minimize the
37:01 casualties in China and minimize the
37:04 spreading to other countries but now
37:05 almost every single country of the
37:07 modern species is reported at least a
37:09 single case let's hope and pray that
37:13 this thing doesn't wipe a bunch of
37:15 people out now the big question that
37:19 I've had for a very long time which is
37:23 can someone rehabilitate out of being a
37:27 liar
37:29 and I think that that answer is sort of
37:33 a two-prong situation I think the answer
37:36 is obviously yes and the answer is
37:38 obviously no but what creates a yes I
37:41 won't tell any more lies and no I'm
37:43 going to continue telling more lies I'm
37:45 not going to stop this habit hmmmm well
37:50 one of them is probably yet to
37:54 experience a negative impact as a result
37:56 of lying so they're saying look no one
37:59 even knows I'm doing this I'm just doing
38:01 this so I'm gonna continue until I get
38:03 cut and the people that actually start
38:06 to Rhys in this methodology are people
38:10 that have experienced shame either be a
38:15 chained by looking in the mirror too
38:17 many times and going oh that's that kind
38:20 of person I'm being that kind of person
38:22 which means they can't continue to hang
38:25 on to these other mechanisms I talked
38:27 about where you know person I dated who
38:30 lied a lot like a lot she would reset
38:33 time every morning I've never told any
38:35 lies as how she kind of reinvented
38:38 herself every morning so if she were to
38:40 start doing me again during the dates to
38:42 her it's the first time she's ever done
38:43 it she would never be accountable for
38:46 her past such everybody she's like a boy
38:50 that called wolf it's like kid knock it
38:52 off would you you know one of the most
38:55 bold-faced lies I ever experienced was
38:57 in a business partnership I told this a
39:00 really long time ago and I think I told
39:02 it in that business episode way back in
39:04 the day I think I did make a business
39:06 category on the website as a matter of
39:07 fact I need to really scour the videos
39:09 and put the other ones in there that
39:12 probably would help out but I met this
39:15 guy by going to my buddy's pizza place
39:17 and this do came in my buddy's like hey
39:20 you know what both of you make video
39:22 games you should work together like
39:24 really you do yeah yeah man oh cool yeah
39:27 see we could knock yeah and for I guess
39:30 about four months or so even that I
39:34 instantly got in there start programming
39:36 big pissy big [ __ ] poker for HBO pretty
39:41 funny
39:42 already existed but I need to fix some
39:43 issues with some of the hands not
39:45 recognizing properly and some other
39:47 little things I was working on but I
39:51 said you know I'm sitting around I'm
39:52 like a business guy I know everybody in
39:54 the gaming industry at the time and I'm
39:56 like okay and I'm gonna go get us a big
39:57 a big gig you know I've been talking to
40:00 on my former colleagues from Electronic
40:03 Arts she's got a pretty big gig and so
40:07 was one of the most popular video game
40:10 names not electronic arts not Activision
40:12 even older and I land a gig for about
40:16 $160,000 it was almost 10 grand more
40:20 than that but whatever and it was to
40:23 create some replacements that were in
40:27 Java there were some Java video games so
40:29 they're all hasbro games at the time and
40:32 they wanted it to be in flash because
40:34 Java was turning into a back-end
40:36 language is not a front-end language and
40:38 I was really good at flash coding so I
40:40 was like ok I will recode everything in
40:42 flash whatever really tough you know
40:44 will you do a full model-view-controller
40:46 front-end which means there's no logic
40:48 and the front end pieces us all from the
40:50 backing it's gonna be great I got the
40:51 team set up but my dude my my partner at
40:55 the time said do you mind if we use my
40:58 company name instead of yours it was
41:01 like mm-hmm he said well because he goes
41:04 like your company's done everything on
41:06 planet Earth mine's just on games it
41:09 might sell better that way
41:10 like all right they can you know I'm
41:12 gonna trust you you've been cool with me
41:14 so far
41:15 mmm big mistake on my part we work at
41:19 this deal I get it closed and what's
41:22 supposed to occur is this this dude
41:25 worked on the game show network website
41:28 which I don't think even exists anymore
41:30 I don't know if it does or not but he's
41:34 supposed to have this big giant kernel
41:36 of code in the background that does
41:38 everything pretty much that we needed to
41:40 do at least a big piece of it's supposed
41:41 to be already coding we just got to put
41:43 a new front end on it migrate that's
41:45 gonna that's why the price is what it is
41:47 now not higher because he's bringing
41:49 this big library of code we don't have
41:51 to do it
41:53 who charged a little bit for it but not
41:54 like a bottom-up build of it right no
41:59 sooner does the McGann I am being
42:02 ridiculously trustworthy and part of it
42:04 was because I was so busy on these other
42:06 little projects for HBO
42:07 that I just didn't have time to you know
42:11 drill and we go you telling me the truth
42:14 you know show me that code I definitely
42:17 saw game show network running so I
42:19 thought you know he said he worked for
42:20 them said you'd all the stuff for him
42:21 like okay good night I kid you not this
42:26 is exactly the scenario that happened I
42:29 get off the phone with my contact she
42:32 says we're faxing over the signed
42:34 contract right now which means it's go
42:36 time baby right
42:37 first check would be in the mail anytime
42:39 now all right it's gonna go to this guy
42:43 and his company name he's gonna decide
42:46 when to write a check to everybody on
42:48 the team I have two other guys besides
42:51 myself lined up to do this work and he's
42:55 supposed to get his coat off blow those
42:57 mothballs off of it it's his code he's
43:00 gonna you know obviously you're gonna
43:01 rewrite it so it's not copyrighted
43:02 anymore by another company they need to
43:05 make changes to it anyway but it's a
43:06 good foundation right here comes the
43:09 facts I have a fax machine
43:11 it's 2004 I get it like oh my god here
43:16 it is right here the sign you know page
43:18 at the last part of the document I take
43:20 it into his office he was a tone deaf
43:23 guy he liked to sing in his desk but he
43:26 was the guy in charge those other two
43:27 employees had to endear his is singing
43:30 was something he was deaf it was
43:32 unbelievable I said okay here's the
43:35 signed contract now whenever you get a
43:37 chance today or tomorrow I need you to
43:40 send me over that code you talked about
43:42 so we could start the project because
43:44 I'm gonna be doing that specific piece
43:46 he looks at me and smiles he says
43:51 there's no code mike is this a joke now
43:57 we'll just do it from scratch I said oh
44:01 so that's gonna be your code then you
44:04 need to write that
44:06 hmm so he he kind of looks kind of weird
44:14 you know he's like obviously he wasn't
44:15 skilled enough to do that type of code
44:17 it's all backing stuff he's a fronting
44:18 guy
44:19 I'm the backing guy and the fronting guy
44:22 so I'm like I'm pissed so that day he
44:29 invites me and one of his other business
44:31 partners to come to lunch we go to lunch
44:35 some fast food restaurant really really
44:38 bringing out the red carpet for us he
44:42 proceeds to tell me at lunch Dana's
44:45 other partner that he is he had a
44:48 previous partnership that went bad and
44:52 he had an IRS problem that resulted in
44:56 him
44:56 owing about almost two hundred thousand
45:00 dollars to the IRS and he's still deep
45:03 into that debt and I mean just like it
45:05 says I get 190 and he said this is gonna
45:09 so save my ass all this money and he is
45:14 basically telling me that he wants to
45:16 pay us the least amount of money
45:18 possible so he can take all that money
45:20 and pay his previous debt off to his
45:22 business partners mmm sounds like
45:26 someone lied to me
45:27 sounds like someone lied to the IRS
45:29 sounds like someone might have lied to
45:31 their previous partners so I am like
45:35 stunned I am pissed
45:38 I need money too dude you know not
45:40 anything more than I'm dude I'm gonna
45:42 get paid for exactly the labor I put in
45:44 this project not a penny more I got two
45:48 other guys they're gonna get equal pay
45:49 checks to mine if not my backing guys
45:53 should have probably you know been
45:54 estimated more than me and we now have
45:57 to wait for this guy to write the checks
46:01 okay so the project starts this guy
46:06 doesn't cut any code at all he's in
46:08 there singing tone-deaf happy as a clam
46:11 because his IRS debts gonna have a sieve
46:15 to suck on right
46:17 I can't remote it was but at some point
46:19 he came into my office and he was kind
46:22 of angry at me for some reason I don't
46:24 know what the deal was no one was we
46:26 were [ __ ] kick and ass on these games
46:27 man
46:28 I just looked at him and I was just like
46:31 you're gonna go there with me you're
46:33 stealing my money you're not even
46:35 working you lied about a whole [ __ ]
46:36 tower of code that doesn't exist and I
46:40 [ __ ] ball this guy out my dad was a
46:44 military man my psychological evaluation
46:47 at 13 was drill sergeant after a big
46:50 giant testicle so I [ __ ] boil this
46:53 guy down and I just let him have it now
46:55 one of his employees got bedridden
46:56 because she was pregnant and so she
46:58 wasn't there the one he took to lunch
46:59 his other employees in the front room
47:01 this Creek guy great guy poor dude had
47:04 to listen to this and he was just
47:06 stunned he was just like oh my god no
47:07 one's ever talked back to me before and
47:08 I'm like dude you can't even [ __ ]
47:10 rebut this man I think I'm saying it
47:12 saying is completely true cuz I don't
47:13 tell lies like you men so then just
47:18 finish the story cuz it's pretty funny
47:21 finally I'm like okay this isn't going
47:24 well
47:24 this guy's lied it's putting the whole
47:26 thing at jeopardy and so this person at
47:30 this other company that hired us is now
47:33 you know we might be late we might you
47:36 know not deliver what we can so we could
47:38 because of this issue where we trying to
47:40 figure out how to do everything we
47:42 figured it all out believe me we got it
47:44 all done and we tripled their sales - it
47:46 was awesome tripled their ad revenues
47:48 but that way we triple the amount of
47:49 people that played the game because they
47:51 could finally play it it was just
47:53 awesome what we created but he then has
47:58 his wife has like an uncle that dies and
48:01 so he flies out of state to go this
48:04 funeral and I'm sitting there going I
48:06 had moved my home office in his office
48:08 now I'm like dude I don't want to be
48:09 here anymore I don't want to be a part
48:11 of this dude's company as soon as this
48:12 is over we're cutting ties baby and so I
48:16 pulled my stuff out of the office
48:18 brought it all home and then my buddy
48:21 and I who we actually went often started
48:23 our company we went into LA
48:28 and talk to this friend of arson he said
48:30 look I'm really really sorry but this is
48:31 what happened buh-buh-buh-buh-buh recap
48:34 to everything and of course she's like
48:37 pissed and but she's not blaming us
48:39 she's like is this in jeopardy I said
48:41 mmm in no ways the deadlines fine the
48:44 codes working great were actually ahead
48:47 of schedule it's gonna be fine because
48:49 we hired one of the smartest backing
48:50 coders on planet earth the backing coder
48:52 and I did a a comm meet 320 million
48:54 dollar platform we did we were the two
48:56 architects that did it so we're safe
48:58 right and he's kicking out these games
49:00 like crazy the back ends at least my
49:02 friend dude was nailing the two I was
49:05 doing the lobby you know you find your
49:07 friends and you join and all the chat
49:08 and all that stuff so anyway those Duke
49:11 comes back from this funeral and he
49:14 realizes I'm not there and so I'm at
49:17 home I'm in this house right here and
49:19 I'm on the phone with the CTO of this
49:21 big company I'm super senior guy and
49:26 we're just talking and everything's good
49:27 he's like oh you know we're testing some
49:28 stuff out or restarting servers cuz we
49:31 had a little memory leak at one point or
49:33 something we were chasing down whatever
49:34 and all sudden my front door starts
49:38 receiving a pounding and I mean
49:43 aggressive no door but I got a perfectly
49:45 functional doorbell but just pattern on
49:47 my door like he's trying to knock it
49:48 down and the guy on the phones like
49:51 what's that noise I said well I'm
49:54 willing to bet it's our our mutual
49:56 friend who's lied about everything he
49:58 knew the whole story he's like okay so
50:00 you mind if I call you back cuz this
50:02 he's not gonna leave all right
50:04 so now the guy's kind of done himself in
50:06 on reputation because this knock on my
50:08 door so loud and so annoying the CTO on
50:10 the other side is going Jesus this guy's
50:13 ridiculous oh my god so I open the door
50:15 and it's one of these things that
50:18 sometimes mommies can hug their sons a
50:20 little too much and give them a little
50:22 too much confidence before they've ever
50:23 had a true confrontation with another
50:25 alpha male this guy thought he was an
50:28 alpha male let's just split that way
50:30 guarantees never had one on his chin
50:32 before ever his life man so I'm sitting
50:36 there you know I'm a ragtag [ __ ]
50:38 cowboy dude and I'm like
50:41 what do you want men and he was he was
50:43 trying to say like he didn't really kind
50:45 of no he didn't rehearse anything he was
50:46 gonna say which was his problem and so
50:49 he's trying to be pissed off that I took
50:50 my stuff home my [ __ ] rights my [ __ ]
50:53 and take anything at his right and you
50:56 know what are you doing man and I don't
50:59 think he knew we called him and told him
51:01 the truth yet or ever visited them and
51:02 told them the truth right and he's
51:05 trying to try like intimidate me I'm
51:08 sitting there going dude you're probably
51:10 40 pounds overweight like what are you
51:14 hoping to accomplish with this
51:15 conversation man and again he already
51:18 bailed him out I bawled him out at his
51:20 place you should have learned his lesson
51:22 because I told him where he stood which
51:24 is a complete [ __ ] liar you know and
51:27 so then I just I always let people kind
51:29 of get it all out and see if they'll
51:30 calm down you know because I don't
51:31 necessarily would be confrontational but
51:34 he wouldn't and because I wasn't like
51:36 thrown back he used her and hurt her
51:37 so if I just took a couple steps at him
51:40 he's on my doorstep this house right
51:42 here and I just [ __ ] let this guy
51:45 have it like you wouldn't believe man if
51:47 I he was just like oh my god because I
51:48 was like if you talk one more time I'm
51:51 gonna hit you in the [ __ ] face you
51:53 know and he he shrunk you know was LL
52:00 Cool J said something like you heard my
52:02 rhymes and your ego shrunk you took
52:04 something like that and it's like he did
52:06 he just it's the last well actually I
52:08 saw him one time like several years
52:10 later at a Whole Foods everything blown
52:12 over and it was like hey dude what's up
52:14 he was getting through that I was
52:15 getting food doesn't make games anymore
52:16 he does business absolutely it's just a
52:19 little disagreement we had but he was on
52:23 the hook for one of six games that he
52:25 was desperately trying to go we coded
52:27 five games it took him like I don't know
52:30 eight months to get the last game done
52:32 and he wanted his full paycheck and the
52:34 other company was like no no I don't
52:36 think you're gonna get full paycheck on
52:37 this because you lied and there's a
52:40 anyway you got to be careful with
52:46 especially businesses obviously
52:49 relationships almost every single
52:51 person's done the relationship thing
52:54 anything with the business situation you
52:56 know except when money's involved can
53:00 really screw you up you know if you're
53:02 relying on cash to pay your bills a
53:04 little different than a relationship I
53:06 mean relationship can go so bad you
53:08 don't go to work or you've done you're
53:10 not good enough at work maybe lose your
53:11 job because you're you're being weird at
53:13 work I think that's pretty rare
53:15 but it can happen you know but the big
53:18 thing is to communicate if you're the
53:19 victim of one of these folks communicate
53:21 with everybody else that this is
53:26 happening to you so you don't get stuck
53:27 you know it's it sounds like it's common
53:31 sense but a lot of folks want to say I
53:32 wasn't a victim of a liar because if I'm
53:35 a victim of a liar then there's
53:36 something wrong with me and that's not
53:38 the case don't ever fall for that BS man
53:42 you don't wanna store everything up
53:44 inside you know I had a talk with a
53:47 friend of mine today about a friend of
53:50 theirs that here in LA he seemed to be
53:54 on top of the world he was revered for
53:58 being a big art collector and and he
54:01 would find artists that were I guess
54:06 previously fairly unknown and he would
54:08 grab their art and encourage them and
54:11 put their art in all the galleries and
54:12 get them a career you know and everyone
54:15 just looked up to this guy he was just a
54:17 personality he was cool very manly but
54:20 you know you were like a captain's hat
54:22 all the time it was really cool like
54:23 itll captain and Tennille hat you know
54:26 and he took his own life and it's kind
54:30 of off topic but it's part of a
54:31 communication algorithm I want you to
54:33 get out of this episode and everybody
54:36 was devastated because they couldn't
54:40 imagine why this guy who was on top
54:42 seemingly never failed in anyone's eye
54:45 on any level ever relationship wise
54:50 business-wise he was just wise you know
54:53 but he took his life and when that
54:59 occurs and almost every single one of
55:00 you knows someone that's done it if
55:03 you're not personally I meet us on a
55:05 first degree for him but least a second
55:07 degree friend
55:08 it's one of those moments where you kind
55:11 of retract your past and you and you
55:14 know like gosh maybe I should have
55:15 talked to them more or we have a whole
55:20 episode on suicide and in season one if
55:22 that's something you need to hear more
55:23 about but it was obviously a lack of
55:26 communication on his part for whatever
55:30 reason whatever demons were haunting him
55:33 he didn't want to admit it to anyone and
55:35 so he didn't get any counseling of any
55:37 kind I don't mean counseling
55:39 professionally which would be great but
55:40 just with friends you know sit down and
55:43 go man I feel horrible why do you feel
55:45 horrible dude blah blah blah blah
55:47 oh man that happened to me too and then
55:51 it's like really how did you get through
55:53 it well you know half the time those
55:55 conversations go like you know I thought
55:59 I couldn't get through it then time
56:01 heals all man I know it's a cliche but
56:03 dude it's a cliche because it's true it
56:05 was usually how it goes and you know
56:07 just know that I'm here for you man
56:09 let's hang out more let's hang out more
56:10 where you going through in fact don't
56:11 even leave spend the night tonight let's
56:13 just whatever she want to drink drink
56:15 whatever you do
56:16 let's just talk it out and then the dude
56:19 feels perhaps that he's not so different
56:23 from everybody else and by hearing a
56:26 story of someone getting through it he
56:29 can go home and sleep at night maybe he
56:32 doesn't go home for a while whatever the
56:35 circumstance is but the amount of times
56:40 I've heard of people taking their own
56:43 life before these [ __ ] in you know
56:45 depressant drugs started doing it for
56:47 them it will be more often than not
56:53 related to someone lying to them
56:55 betraying them
56:58 sometimes it's the liar that gets to the
57:01 end of their game and can't lie anymore
57:03 they're losing traction the plane is
57:06 stalling out right it's going straight
57:07 up with all those lies and then all of a
57:09 sudden poof no more money no more
57:13 lifestyle I can't think about going down
57:17 because the whole thing the whole life
57:19 itself was a lie
57:22 one of the kind of like the I don't know
57:25 it's sort of frustrating and funny at
57:28 the same time is one of the you know
57:30 pseudo-intellectual moves online is the
57:33 shill statement right
57:34 you're a [ __ ] she's like really
57:37 really you know any one of the hardcore
57:39 listeners where's that statement and
57:41 just laugh right did you get these
57:44 one-offs to come in every once a while
57:45 you're paid by the deep statements like
57:47 for what dude exposing them what are you
57:50 kidding me
57:50 my god my listeners are sick and tired
57:53 of hearing about the deep state from me
57:54 if anything great but what's interesting
57:57 about that is it's sort of the bizarre
58:00 pseudo lie calling someone with they're
58:03 not hmm are calling of something that
58:07 you don't have any proof of hmm really
58:10 strange you know with neil degrasse
58:12 tyson for instance the pop science guy
58:16 you sit there initially and you see that
58:18 guy just redefine what the world is
58:22 right he said the world was a pear shape
58:23 and then he said it was your name
58:27 escapes me but it's you know it's when
58:29 the the equator is fatter than the rest
58:32 of the diameter it's it's
58:33 disproportionately fatter rate well how
58:36 can he have it both ways you know my
58:39 physics teacher told me in school he's
58:40 also my astronomy teacher he built a
58:42 [ __ ] star projector by himself man
58:45 drilled all the holes for all the stars
58:48 at the proper diameter to make sure the
58:52 brightness was perfect right this guy
58:54 was the absolute genius when he was 13
58:56 he ground his own lens for his own first
58:58 telescope by hand in a stump of a tree
59:01 at 13 very smart guy I put him away
59:05 above Neil deGrasse Tyson any day of the
59:07 week he said you know if you dried up
59:09 all the oceans on the earth it would be
59:11 the most perfectly circular thing in in
59:15 on our earth like if you take it and
59:17 shrink it down right go with hylia
59:20 century on this analogy but you know he
59:23 said it would be smoother than a cue
59:24 ball like well now we've got guys like
59:28 yeah it's a pair to shape tetrahedron
59:30 and you know whatever I do you can't
59:33 believe everything that contradicts
59:34 itself
59:35 audience oohs oh yes you did well that
59:37 that makes it inconvenient for me so I
59:39 didn't say that all of the contradicting
59:42 astronauts right there's no sound in
59:44 space because I saw 2001 oh it was
59:46 deafening yeah seriously no dust moved
59:50 out from underneath the Apollo Lander
59:51 but we filmed it we filmed tons of dust
59:53 moving out the window that's the shot
59:55 everybody sees but now no didn't happen
59:58 because they dropped the thing down on
60:00 the set with the crane loop see and you
60:04 don't like I said I think I just said
60:09 there's some of the episodes I just put
60:11 out future lives right I gotta be
60:16 another lie episode oh my god I'll put
60:18 some other stuff before this comes out I
60:20 think I have about three in the queue
60:23 but you have people like astronauts
60:26 which I believe were forced to live for
60:28 the sake of the threats right and you
60:30 know the interesting thing about threats
60:31 is the they mean different things to
60:33 different people different times what
60:37 may have inspired an astronaut to live
60:39 for their entire career in 1969 maybe
60:42 that wouldn't work today maybe in 69
60:45 because they were definitely in the
60:46 wholesale slaughter of people that were
60:48 in their way
60:49 you know imagine you're Buzz Aldrin you
60:53 know I'm strong Michael Collins and
60:54 they're telling you you're gonna say
60:56 that you went to the moon or else well
60:59 today we haven't had an assassination in
61:03 in years well what did they see in 69 by
61:08 69 in that decade they killed the
61:10 president United States Malcolm X Martin
61:13 Luther King and Robert Kennedy the
61:15 president's brother who was well on his
61:19 way to perhaps being the president
61:21 himself today or an astronaut and they
61:25 just come over and tell you you know
61:28 that JFK dude well we took him out I'm
61:30 okay took him out Malcolm X took him out
61:32 RFK we took him out who are you
61:35 it's just a lowly little astronaut we'll
61:39 just say you died on reentry you drown
61:42 in that that will just drown the whole
61:43 capsule [ __ ] all you guys you you're on
61:46 board yeah and
61:48 we had that press conference where Neil
61:50 Armstrong literally looks like a kid
61:54 that has been crying
61:55 the other two looked absolutely
61:57 devastated right they're terrified to
62:00 answer questions then later in life they
62:03 contradicted many of their answers I
62:04 didn't see any stars and then Michael
62:07 Collins writes a book I saw tons of
62:08 stars I still regret getting Michael
62:12 Collins name wrong about the astronaut
62:13 that was killed no hi a totally
62:15 different guy
62:15 big flub on my side I like these
62:20 subjects
62:20 I like these subjects because they're
62:22 important to us and they'd become you
62:25 know hopefully you don't have a lot of
62:26 liars in your lifetime but when it
62:28 happens I would say this you know if you
62:31 have experienced several Liars in your
62:32 lifetime like I have you kind of get
62:35 used to it
62:36 you like okay people lying all right
62:38 kind of lies that person - oh yeah
62:41 that's a classic man and you just
62:43 whatever you know and then sometimes you
62:45 like how you doing one of those I got to
62:47 get rid of you now you know you're out
62:48 on my circle see you later
62:50 it's gonna have a relationship we could
62:52 have been really good but you lie me
62:54 hopefully that's pretty rare for
62:56 everybody I think the people that are
62:58 most devastated are people that have
63:01 never heard a lie in their life they
63:03 trust everybody because they want the
63:05 world to be that good how do you think
63:07 all these people get duped by these
63:08 political parties and these global
63:11 agendas because they don't want to
63:13 believe anyone is dishonest especially
63:15 the higher the authority figure goes
63:17 they're relying on those people being
63:19 truthful and they're not and so if any
63:24 of you've ever tried to wake up another
63:25 human being that's what you're really
63:27 trying to convince them to understand is
63:30 that people lie and the problem is is
63:33 they have heroes right I have relatives
63:36 that think Hillary Clinton is absolutely
63:40 God's angel on earth and I mean without
63:44 exaggeration they don't think this
63:46 person's ever lied some people are so
63:49 swept up by the difference between
63:52 George Bush jr. and Obama
63:56 then when he seemed to be much more
63:58 articulate which was definitely the case
64:00 they can't imagine how did we know
64:03 George Bush jr. lied he's part of the
64:04 Bush family but Obama my god he was
64:06 picked because he was God's right hand
64:09 you know and it's like okay and the
64:13 bummer is this and all of you
64:15 experienced this if you've tried to wake
64:16 up anyone to anything they kill the
64:20 messenger don't they
64:21 you're the jerk you're the liar and
64:25 isn't that interesting
64:27 we talk a lot about how Satanist II
64:30 groups reverse polarity that is good and
64:33 good is bad and it didn't hit me until
64:35 this last decade where you know Run DMC
64:41 who I loved dearly and I don't think
64:43 they're part of anything nefarious okay
64:45 god bless Jason Mazzella man Jam Master
64:47 Jay took taken from us for some stupid
64:51 reason I feel like everybody knows who
64:54 killed him but they don't say especially
64:56 I don't know no one investigated
64:57 anything he just gets shot in his sounds
64:59 Studios is a music studio and was like
65:02 oh yeah that happened like everybody
65:04 knows but nobody knows you know but
65:06 anyway they had the lyric they
65:08 introduced the idea of saying that's bad
65:12 meaning it's good what was the line not
65:16 bad meaning bad but bad meaning good huh
65:19 mmm reversed polarity interesting right
65:23 you build a mechanism in your mind to
65:26 reverse the polarity of something and
65:28 then you've got a placeholder in your
65:32 brain which can do that to everything
65:34 hmm we have to be careful Richter vases
65:40 movie which was pulled from a Twilight
65:43 Zone and I love Richter base and I
65:45 credit him 100% there's no no bummer
65:48 that he pulled this from a Twilight Zone
65:49 so don't think I'm criticizing the guy
65:50 in any way shape or form in fact this
65:52 year or the tailing of last year he
65:54 became an unbelievable hero to me for
65:57 what he did at the Golden Globes but I
65:59 did a whole episode about him and the
66:02 camera shut off for some dumb reason and
66:05 I lost it
66:06 but it was based on a trolley zone
66:11 called the great frisbee we told nothing
66:13 but lies but he was revered for it in
66:15 his little hardware store and aliens
66:17 picked him up because they thought he
66:18 was the smartest guy in the world and he
66:22 doesn't know why they picked him up and
66:24 they said well because you're the
66:25 smartest man in the world
66:26 you said you have 36 degrees and or
66:29 whatever and you invented all this stuff
66:32 we want to bring you back with us
66:33 because you're the smartest human in the
66:34 world he says oh my god you don't know
66:36 that I'm telling lies and the alien said
66:39 lie what's a lie race is oh my gosh you
66:44 know I tell tall tales it's not true
66:46 they couldn't conceive of it because in
66:48 their culture they don't lie to each
66:49 other and imagine just imagine that if
66:52 that happened that would be interesting
66:53 that's what Richter base based is moving
66:56 on which because there's the Jim Carrey
66:57 movie liar liar I always forget the
67:00 Richter face was like invention of a lie
67:02 or something like that you know but he's
67:04 in a world where he goes and gets money
67:06 out of the bank he almost has sex with a
67:08 woman and I would tell I mean he grows a
67:10 conscience and he can't do it you know
67:12 and I don't think I've seen that movie
67:14 all the way through I need to make sure
67:15 I see that all the way through but it's
67:18 just the interesting dynamic to
67:19 understand that that that that's a joke
67:25 the twilight zone was a joke and richer
67:28 vase movie was a joke and why is it a
67:30 joke because we know Liars lie and
67:33 they're everywhere you know you know the
67:38 uncle talking about catching a I don't
67:40 know eight pound catfish or bass or
67:43 whatever yeah you know we all kind of
67:46 have in the list a little small town
67:48 where I was like did you see the fish I
67:50 didn't see the fish you take a
67:51 photograph of it no okay you know with
67:55 Photoshop today we have all these crazy
67:56 you know wildlife catches for yeah these
67:59 bears the size of houses and some guy
68:01 posing on it you know it's all photo
68:02 show I think it's hilarious but we have
68:07 to be careful and I think that one of
68:11 the things we can do as human beings
68:15 this is sort of audit ourselves every
68:16 once in a while like maybe we do tell a
68:18 little white lies and we don't realize
68:20 is it and it's maybe it's because we're
68:23 being funny and it's you know it's gonna
68:25 be revealed in five minutes did you do
68:27 that no you know and it's like five
68:29 minutes you know they're gonna find out
68:30 and it's gonna be funny that you did
68:32 little kids did you clean your room yeah
68:35 they didn't right so I thought I'd make
68:39 an episode on it because it just is
68:41 something it comes up in conversation it
68:43 comes up on my brain all the time
68:44 especially whatever happens to me I
68:46 thought we could compare notes so now
68:50 it's your turn
68:51 get in the comments section on YouTube
68:52 or Facebook and just a little minds calm
68:55 or Twitter just let me know sort of what
68:58 your experiences have been especially if
69:00 you can find a brand new archetype
69:02 that's very repetitive in society I
69:04 think we could all learn from that name
69:06 maybe even share a few laughs to go oh
69:08 god yeah I've had that one too you know
69:10 it's just a nice relief valve for us to
69:12 kind of maybe blow off some steam and
69:14 sure to shake off some some bad cobwebs
69:17 of our past you know either be at our
69:20 own lies or someone else's lies will be
69:22 experienced but definitely realize
69:24 communication is everything you know and
69:27 I said a long time ago in an episode
69:32 just to get back to that little
69:33 digression if you're feeling bad and we
69:36 need to say this more to each other I
69:38 think you know it used to be a a pretty
69:45 common knowledge thing it's been written
69:46 in several television shows and several
69:48 four cheers used to do all the time but
69:51 also movies where if you're feeling
69:53 really bad for any reason whatsoever in
69:56 life whether it be a lie that was told
69:59 to you or just things going bad just
70:02 just go somewhere and pick up us you
70:05 know pick up but I mean talk to a
70:07 stranger see if you can get them to
70:09 listen to you realize their gifting you
70:12 with their time so try to be as
70:14 attentive to that as possible call an
70:17 old friend
70:18 call an old friend you haven't talked to
70:21 you and just say man can I cheer you're
70:24 off for just a second I just got this
70:26 thing you know hopefully got some close
70:28 friends you can just tap on because
70:30 again my friendship episode it's all
70:32 about you know if you're going to give
70:33 someone
70:34 label a friend then there should be
70:37 something that is actually occurring
70:39 there of value and your friend should be
70:42 there for you maybe someone's more
70:44 talented than others just just try them
70:47 out but you know communication rules
70:50 solve a lot of issues man and time does
70:52 heal all it is crazy like again you know
70:56 the stories I've told you tonight's
70:57 about people lying to me boy when it was
71:00 occurring oh my god I mean I was fuming
71:03 human worst version of myself that could
71:06 ever come out and that's the other thing
71:07 that sucks right if you're in a
71:09 situation where you know you're a really
71:11 nice level-headed person you don't lie
71:14 but somehow it's happening to you and
71:16 your reaction because you haven't been
71:18 lied to that much let's just say or you
71:20 never really got good at it being lied
71:22 to you know if it starts making you the
71:25 worst version of yourself because you're
71:27 reacting badly it's a time to clip-clip
71:31 the influence clip that circle shrink it
71:33 a little bit get rid of those people
71:34 replace them with something else I
71:36 guarantee you as hard as it might sound
71:39 and some of you will get this right away
71:41 because you're probably dealing with the
71:42 situation right now hope none of you are
71:44 but if you are it's better to be by
71:48 yourself and be in an integral world
71:51 where at least you know which you're
71:53 good at which you're bad at you know
71:55 what your flaws your strengths whatever
71:58 it's better for you to be in that sphere
72:01 of influence than with these people
72:03 they're toxic and sometimes we just need
72:07 someone to remind us of that so
72:10 hopefully that's useful to you and I
72:14 hope you feel me so if you haven't
72:17 please go to deep thoughts radio.com

72:21 and s up to 9 467 episodes that are
72:25 published with probably at least a dozen
72:27 and a half special reports some of those
72:31 special reports get turned off because I
72:32 feel like you just need it for that
72:33 moment and I don't think it has any
72:35 value moving forward there are just a
72:37 teeny tiny tiny amount of episodes maybe
72:40 two or three that have been completely
72:41 turned off because the subject matter
72:42 just became antiquated the data became
72:44 old or I felt like I wasn't accurate
72:47 anymore

72:50 website we have two sources for the
