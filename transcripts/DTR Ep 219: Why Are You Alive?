00:35 today we're going to talk about
00:37 something that is I think seldom
00:41 contemplated and rarely asked which is
00:44 why are you alive question is very
00:48 interesting in it and my partner as a
00:50 saying which is it reminds you of
00:53 something you've never seen before and I
00:56 think that the question why are you
00:59 alive outside of some you know goal
01:02 oriented conversation when you go to the
01:04 existential layer of this truly why did
01:08 anyone create you why do why do any of
01:10 us exist it starts to sound like a
01:13 question you've never heard before a
01:15 thought process you've never heard
01:17 before but maybe you have I'm going to
01:21 wager most listeners in this youtube
01:24 channel iTunes podcast whatever do you
01:29 have actually had very detailed thoughts
01:31 about this but I thought to be valuable
01:33 for us to all go in it together and sort
01:37 of open it up and this kind of stems off
01:40 of the episode abate on dealing with
01:42 stress where I reveal this notion of
01:47 being a trivial being what's the point
01:50 in being alive and dying if you're just
01:53 going to be a trivial human being now I
01:57 will preface that statement and I
01:58 probably should have thought it through
02:00 a little bit more because then I want I
02:01 don't want anyone to look in the mirror
02:02 and get depressed we do have been wants
02:05 --is and things that we do that are
02:06 hilarious and interesting and no one's
02:09 there to share with us and so you might
02:13 feel as
02:14 you trivial on some sort of obtuse
02:18 course of observation meaning yet I did
02:22 just get married and I did just have a
02:23 couple kids and I now have my grandkids
02:25 and I'm punching out fifteen twenty
02:28 thirty years from now and I probably
02:29 don't have the ability to do anything
02:33 super special and it that's obviously
02:37 not true because on the fine-tuning
02:39 level of how you might walk down the
02:42 hallway look yourself in the mirror tell
02:45 a little joke to your kids or your
02:47 spouse or whatever it's that little
02:50 stuff that might actually make you super
02:52 interesting to the universe so again not
02:54 everything's Hollywood not everything's
02:55 whatever else right
02:58 you'd be the small stuff that makes you
03:00 ultra rare it could be just simply how
03:03 you formed a thought in your brain for
03:06 those of you who haven't read or
03:07 listened to The Hitchhiker's Guide to
03:09 the galaxy by Douglas Adams the earth is
03:13 a gigantic computer in that book and
03:15 it's trying to calculate the question to
03:18 the answer of life the universe and
03:21 everything like why do we exist this is
03:23 basically what that thing is and the
03:26 answer is 42 which never made any sense
03:29 because they built a computer to come up
03:30 with the answer first and without
03:32 actually crap calculating the question
03:35 it's a comedy that's why it's crazy like
03:37 that but what Douglas Adams did was he
03:41 took all the organic mass and matter on
03:44 earth and the earth itself and turned it
03:46 into a gigantic computer and we are
03:48 merely the organic chemistry that is the
03:52 circuitry of the computer and so in his
03:57 world we are here for that specific
03:59 crazy purpose right but now an atheist
04:02 will look at this entire you know
04:05 argument and just depending on what kind
04:07 of how hit they are probably walk away
04:10 from this entire question because the
04:12 idea is it's just science and system is
04:14 whatever what's fascinating having gone
04:18 down the path I've never been an atheist
04:20 ever but going down the path of science
04:23 to somehow get closer to God it really
04:26 is one of these
04:27 self-defeating things although I would
04:29 recommend it to anyone which is it's
04:32 like one of those Hollywood shots where
04:33 they they pull the camera back and zoom
04:35 in at the same time and so you see the
04:38 camera is kind of pulling back but the
04:39 tunnel is getting longer and longer is a
04:42 great scene was really debuted in my
04:45 opinion I'm sorry my experience in 1982
04:49 with poltergeist where the mothers
04:52 trying to run after her daughter and the
04:54 whole hallways elongating it was great
04:56 that that futility of trying to grab the
05:00 answers an atheist using Sciences very
05:04 quickly found and even the most staunch
05:09 atheist interviewed by Christians or by
05:11 someone of any type of religion to get
05:14 to the point where they you could see
05:15 that they're struggling with the chicken
05:17 and the egg concept of was there ever
05:20 nothing and if there wasn't ever nothing
05:25 and you can't keep half of your [ __ ]
05:27 science you know let's say you approach
05:31 the question and you're lugging on your
05:32 back your religion of choice your
05:36 paradigm of worship regardless of how
05:40 right or wrong or good or bad your
05:43 religion is you have the ability to sit
05:47 and really think about this question
05:49 because you believe that something
05:51 created us now if you're in the
05:55 mezzanine in the middle and you're like
05:56 eh well I kind of think aliens made us
05:58 they're not really gods but they're
05:59 definitely not you know they're not a
06:03 Christian God but it's not a theist if
06:06 somebody made us and so so does together
06:08 and put us here then you can sort of
06:12 have an excuse of why you exist it's
06:14 more benign and functional I still think
06:19 that in life you seldom do anything
06:22 unless there's a purpose what do you
06:26 clean your room well because if you
06:28 don't you're not gonna be able to walk
06:29 in there anymore because if you don't
06:30 the bugs are going to final that food
06:32 you left in the corner they're going to
06:34 implement infiltrate your house and if
06:35 there's one thing you hate more than
06:37 rotting food its bug infestations and
06:40 everyone has a reason for everything so
06:44 for us to be created by anything
06:46 there is a reason because obviously open
06:49 your eyes take a look around and
06:50 everything that exists and try not to
06:53 categorize man too
06:55 too high over everything else all right
06:57 yes we are extremely special just
07:00 because we can't understand how plants
07:01 think and how animals think we can't pat
07:05 ourselves on the back too much I mean
07:07 I'm pretty sure weird amazing
07:09 achievements for whoever is put this
07:11 place together but it could very well be
07:14 that the earth itself is the main
07:17 character and we're merely in the
07:20 supporting role it's funny how the
07:24 internet with all this flatter stuff and
07:27 all these heavy conspiracies it's got
07:29 people thinking so much but now I can
07:33 have conversations with people who've
07:35 already been thinking about something
07:36 for six months to a couple years maybe
07:38 even 10 years but I was having thoughts
07:41 of when I was a kid I'm sure you're one
07:43 of those kids too but you know isn't it
07:45 interesting now I had a conversation
07:48 with a friend of mine and he actually
07:51 made the joke he goes oh guys just think
07:53 pretty soon they're going to make a
07:54 video telling us that plants think and
07:56 the plants are alive I just kind of
08:00 looked at him I thought isn't it weird
08:02 that you think that that's weird
08:04 of course they're alive of course they
08:07 think of course they do what they do
08:08 it's not just all pure instinct why
08:11 would it
08:12 what's consciousness can you put
08:14 consciousness in a bottle no well how do
08:17 you explain someone who is had a
08:18 near-death experience they pop out of
08:20 their body and they can still see with
08:22 their eyeballs but they don't have any
08:23 eyes right so consciousness is extremely
08:28 extremely real and it has the ability to
08:30 be completely aware of color sight sound
08:33 everything without the instrumentalities
08:35 of your vessel there's just too many
08:38 people of too many walks of life
08:40 too many ages different races different
08:42 cultures different geographical areas
08:44 who all have reported the exact same
08:47 thing when they have near-death
08:48 experiences and they float outside their
08:50 body
08:51 so consciousness is very very real right
08:54 let's go down some of the lines of
08:56 answers that might be true let's just
08:59 think it through why are you alive and
09:03 when I say you in this episode I really
09:05 mean we let's go at the most benign
09:09 definition or answer I should say we're
09:14 just here because this is what mass does
09:17 over a really long period of time we're
09:21 just a byproduct that's interesting and
09:23 our Creator whoever that is created
09:27 ether winds and thru currents everything
09:31 exists and I mean there's only one
09:33 particle and everything exists on that
09:35 one particle we just classify it in two
09:38 different forms of energy some of it
09:42 stays moving at a high velocity and we
09:44 call that maybe electricity or a photon
09:49 or it slows down it gets stuck in a
09:52 little whirlwind and we call that
09:53 electron Neutron or proton a positron
09:56 and we just sort of happen but then you
10:02 start thinking about okay if that's the
10:03 case if we're some random creation here
10:05 simply because this kind of stuff
10:07 happens then it doesn't really address
10:10 the infinite range of emotions that we
10:13 can have as living beings because we're
10:15 not just an it we're a who we have
10:20 identity when you look at the blades of
10:23 grass in your front yard
10:24 you probably don't overlay on top of it
10:27 the paradigm of a discrete population of
10:32 blades of grass you don't see Timmy and
10:35 Johnny and Susie and Sally you see green
10:37 grass if you chop them down with your
10:41 lawnmower but they don't move they just
10:46 grow back the tips we seem to be much
10:51 more mobile and versatile we feel love
10:53 and hate and happiness and sadness and
10:55 betrayal and elation we also have a
11:01 sense that there is a
11:04 a battery of questions that we want
11:06 answered where the hell do we come from
11:08 why are we here life the universe and
11:12 everything now on a sociological level
11:17 if you study the question from a mass
11:19 population there's probably a different
11:21 perspective on the answer or even a
11:23 different strategy by which you would
11:25 contemplate the answer well it's not one
11:28 individual it's the whole thing
11:30 I don't plant one blade of grass to
11:32 cover my yard I apply it thousands and
11:34 millions of blades of grass to cover my
11:35 yard so maybe man isn't anything
11:39 important by himself but as a
11:41 conglomerate this slow growing living
11:45 walking bipedal fungus on the outside of
11:48 this sphere or flat disc or here on a
11:53 sociological level we're really dealing
11:55 with us growing together after being
11:59 somehow separated into different tribes
12:01 different races different languages
12:03 different cultures different
12:06 geographical advantages on each other
12:08 right you know I can't move to Africa
12:12 and live in the desert and a guy from
12:15 Africa may not be able to do well up and
12:17 say the Alps where it's really cold or
12:19 where Eskimos live I mean we both find
12:22 somehow to do it but we wouldn't be
12:23 predispositioned with it that's
12:26 interesting so how long would it take a
12:29 sociological experiment let's just say
12:31 we put our shoes we put ourselves in the
12:34 shoes of our creator and you look at
12:37 this and you go well maybe it takes a
12:40 lot uh 50 million years to see how the
12:43 human beings figure all this stuff out
12:46 whether or not they destroy themselves
12:47 or not but what if we zoom down to the
12:51 individual level now it becomes
12:55 infinitely in my opinion infinitely more
12:57 complex because as a large group we can
13:02 get you know mob think groupthink all
13:05 this other stuff and then we have at the
13:07 individual much more intense level of
13:12 bias
13:15 because each one of us has a different
13:18 historical path you could live with five
13:22 brothers and sisters five brothers five
13:24 sisters family of eleven you're the
13:26 middle child you're the sixth child to
13:28 be born and you live there your whole
13:31 life until you leave the house at
13:32 whatever age and you will still be
13:35 distinctly different than all of your
13:36 siblings because you saw things
13:41 different maybe there's some minorities
13:42 across the street or I shouldn't even
13:44 say it but a different race that lives
13:45 across the street and for whatever
13:48 reason some of your brothers and sisters
13:50 were irrationally afraid and some of
13:53 them were best friends because he simply
13:56 came out of the house with a different
13:58 bias they saw a different television
13:59 show that you heard one of your aunts
14:01 and uncles father mothers say something
14:03 either beneficial to that race or
14:04 negative to that race and they took that
14:06 bias and just put the lenses on their
14:08 eyeballs and saw people the wrong way
14:10 I'll give you the right way where they
14:13 can accept them you know but maybe
14:16 there's more dimensions to the question
14:20 what is being alive right what is being
14:24 alive well let's look at being alive in
14:27 two different methods being alive in a
14:31 true body that actually dies and there's
14:33 nothing there's no soul
14:35 you just fizzle out and you're dust on
14:37 the ground which I think that we've we
14:42 as that we as a nation we as a
14:44 population I shouldn't say nation we as
14:46 a world nation have proven this
14:47 completely incorrect and hard to believe
14:52 impossible to believe in my opinion
14:54 because of all these weird experiences
14:55 were people coming back and children
14:57 having old souls and just not a body
15:01 experiences that people can have taking
15:03 various drugs like acid or ayahuasca
15:07 where you start to see more and it seems
15:12 to come back to your life after you have
15:14 these experiences and you're permanently
15:16 changed for the rest of your life about
15:18 doing the drug twice but if we lived
15:21 only one time ever ever ever there's no
15:24 heaven there's no ass
15:25 to life then this would be a very
15:27 bizarre existence and would probably be
15:29 even more pointless because our
15:34 designers would have given us not enough
15:36 life to really become any level of
15:39 refined being a hundred years if we all
15:43 live the hundred years and we lived it
15:45 absolutely healthy and it's just some
15:46 logan's run renew at the end where we're
15:49 just going to the ground and we're gone
15:53 it wouldn't be enough time with it I
15:57 mean you can get okay you can get pretty
16:00 good at stuff but I mean what would
16:01 another hundred years due to whatever
16:03 skill sets you manifest in the first
16:05 hundred years because it takes you 20-30
16:09 years to even remotely find what you're
16:11 going to master in your life right you
16:13 make these choices about what you want
16:15 to do then if you lived 100 years the
16:17 only 72 to perfect them but then new
16:20 tools come out new perceptions do
16:21 advances in culture if you had another
16:24 hundred years after that you would start
16:25 the next hundred years in your
16:29 profession in your mastery and why the
16:33 hell are we bound to one thing why can't
16:36 you be the artist the musician the
16:38 linguist the whatever the doctor the
16:41 singer the schoolteacher why can't you
16:43 be at all what's the point in stopping
16:46 us why did our creators give us such a
16:50 limited time span my personal answer to
16:53 this is that there is reincarnation and
16:56 again just a stress in case you haven't
16:58 seen any other episodes before this
17:00 reincarnation is not a cop-out for being
17:02 afraid of being dead I could give a [ __ ]
17:06 you know about what's going to happen
17:08 after this I mean I I'm excited to find
17:11 out what the mystery is why people like
17:13 Steve Jobs say oh god oh god or oh wow
17:15 oh wow at the very last part of his life
17:19 why people tend to get spiritual at the
17:21 inner life is very interesting some of
17:23 them get spiritual because they have a
17:26 religious construct over the top of them
17:29 they've been filling guilty the entire
17:31 time for not worshiping in and so at the
17:33 end they're trying to reclaim and get
17:35 sacrificed aged because they're afraid
17:37 for their soul because they got this
17:38 notion that
17:39 a total prick once you stop treating God
17:42 like man and stop defining him like man
17:44 with his immaturity z' and all this
17:46 stuff like we have you start to just get
17:49 excited it's almost like going up the
17:51 roller coaster so if you're on your
17:53 deathbed and you're you're exiting
17:55 you're just looking at the roller
17:56 coaster it's going up it's going up and
17:57 then right when you die you're at the
17:59 top of that drop and then it's boom boom
18:01 you know and it's built to be fun it's
18:03 built to be safe and it's built to be
18:06 the adventure that you signed up for and
18:09 being alive in the first place but I
18:12 think there's something really fun about
18:14 this and not everyone will get this
18:18 round the first run but hopefully by the
18:20 end of this you'll be on board but a lot
18:24 of you are going to be ready to roll and
18:25 you've already been living your life
18:26 this way anyway let me ask you this how
18:31 many of you have ever been goofing
18:33 around in your house it doesn't matter
18:35 if you live with people or not but you
18:36 had a private moment to yourself and you
18:38 made a little joke and you cracked
18:40 yourself up you know like that was funny
18:44 I wish someone else could have seen that
18:45 but you're kind of spiritual and you
18:48 believe in a God and so at some point
18:50 you kind of look up and you go god I
18:52 hope that made you laugh I hope you had
18:54 a good time with that as I'm being silly
18:56 no one else can see it only there's only
18:59 you know two categories of beings that
19:01 could have seen it
19:02 besides the NSA you have a god and you
19:09 might have the accompaniment of spirits
19:12 life forces without bodies that are
19:15 limited by anything in this world time
19:17 or space and so they can sit there and
19:19 help you and watch you and laugh with
19:21 you cry with you help you inspire you
19:24 help you pick yourself up off the ground
19:27 if you've ever had that thought then
19:31 what's interesting is life becomes
19:33 there's a whole nother paradigm almost a
19:35 dimension of being alive that suddenly
19:38 arrives because you're living almost in
19:45 a direct relationship with your Creator
19:49 whoever that is
19:51 now if aliens dropped us off and they're
19:55 not here they're not here and they
19:57 probably don't you know hear the tree
19:59 make any sound as it falls down in the
20:00 woods if your Creator is omnipotent or
20:04 interdimensional and really does pay
20:06 attention to you that perhaps they're
20:08 there hopefully they have a good sense
20:10 of humor
20:11 hopefully that's why they made us have
20:12 such a reaction to you know conflicting
20:15 thoughts hitting each other in our
20:17 brains which makes us laugh that's what
20:19 comedy is take two things that don't
20:21 belong in the same place and the current
20:23 culture of wherever you are and slam
20:25 them together and a joke and that's why
20:27 you laugh because it's a nervous
20:29 reaction to trying to process quirky
20:34 information I guess that's outside of
20:37 being tickled but what could this answer
20:40 give us if we can if we can sink our
20:43 claws into any Theory whatsoever about
20:45 this whole thing
20:46 what is the benefit which would kind of
20:50 fuel the sort of enjoyment of listening
20:54 to this episode and my answer to you is
20:57 it will give you more purpose once you
21:01 can sort of determine for yourself with
21:04 your own biases with your own instincts
21:07 why are you alive and what do we say
21:11 about purpose on a show purpose is love
21:15 and love this purpose it's a beautiful
21:19 thing
21:20 and it's a very true thing some of you
21:23 have had wonderful lives where you have
21:27 found your purpose early it doesn't
21:29 necessarily have to be complex in the
21:32 slightest degree in fact the true
21:34 blessing is when you find your purpose
21:38 and it's very accessible it's very easy
21:42 to define you know there's a lot of
21:44 family-owned businesses which pass on to
21:46 their children
21:47 however grateful or ungrateful beautiful
21:50 businesses that are profitable that can
21:52 take care of all the needs and once in
21:54 life and it's just all you do is get up
21:59 make the dough make the marinara sauce
22:01 and make pizzas and sell them and every
22:04 single time someone takes a body
22:05 that family recipe with the yeast
22:07 culture that's 200 years old out of
22:11 Naples they have a religious experience
22:15 because it is so freakin delicious and
22:18 the day that you skimp on the recipe
22:21 immediately it suffers and and the
22:27 experience is less for people if you're
22:30 like me you are interested interested in
22:32 almost all things in life you want to
22:34 experience all things in life you want
22:36 to think about all things in life some
22:38 things you're totally content with
22:40 dabbling in a little bit just to kind of
22:41 see what it was like and other things
22:43 you want to devote your life to but the
22:45 second you find two things you want to
22:47 devote your life to that are in the
22:49 competing space like your careers you
22:51 want to be a painter but you want to be
22:53 I don't know a musician maybe you've got
22:58 time maybe you're lucky the first 20
23:01 years of your life you learned how to
23:02 play guitar and sing the second however
23:05 many years you got left
23:06 you can paint because playing an
23:08 instrument is actually now second nature
23:13 okay let's go back into God's brain no
23:17 for one second if we are living trivial
23:22 lives and that does not mean to say and
23:25 I probably should have clarified this in
23:26 the other episode it doesn't mean it's
23:30 not valuable it doesn't mean it's not
23:34 good it's just what you are doing with
23:38 your life is what everyone else is done
23:40 with their life on average it is the
23:42 it's the bell curve of what people have
23:45 spent their time doing right if you want
23:50 to pop out of that just kind of you're
23:52 not trying to be an anarchist you're not
23:54 trying to you know piss people off but
23:57 you want to do something different and
23:58 you don't even sure what it is you just
23:59 start doing weird stuff this is what
24:02 kids do when they go through the rite of
24:04 passage in America without any guidance
24:06 and notification that this is going to
24:09 be a biological transformation in their
24:11 body girls have this amazing
24:14 transformation about 13 using the pop
24:17 culture guide guidelines which
24:19 I mean Christ is there anything more
24:21 terrifying than that the [ __ ]
24:22 television tells them to do things they
24:24 do things right but there's this weird
24:26 thing about 13 girls are ready to get
24:29 married and have babies you know their
24:30 brains are fantasizing about this kind
24:32 of stuff boys and you know they're maybe
24:35 they're getting into touching girls a
24:38 lot of it's you know whatever their
24:40 fathers do they typically get into that
24:42 or their neighbor's father you know boys
24:47 about 13 14 try to grow mustaches they
24:51 shave even though they don't have to and
24:52 then you get sort of like your
24:54 rebellious movements like again punk
24:57 rockers back in the 70s and 80s we have
25:00 our own sort of gothy kids that do stuff
25:03 today and they're just experimenting
25:06 with things they've never done before
25:08 they want to dress a weird way such that
25:11 they maybe kick into a different thought
25:17 process I mean I can't imagine I've
25:20 never known anyone who's been goth
25:22 personally but I've met a ton of them in
25:25 my lifetime but it's not been like a
25:27 close friend of mine and there's this
25:28 transformation between you're not goth
25:30 and you're golf so you have maybe blonde
25:34 hair and pale skin or maybe up tan skin
25:37 and blue eyes
25:37 let's you go pale you make your hair
25:40 black you're using dye all the time the
25:42 bathtubs just covered in [ __ ] you
25:44 know weird colors and in the end they're
25:47 following common law but not harming
25:50 anybody they're just having fun thinking
25:53 differently and the coolest parents kind
25:55 of they kind of egg you on and I think
25:59 honestly some parents do a good job too
26:02 by saying you know what I hope you grow
26:03 out of the [ __ ] at some point you need
26:06 to get a job maybe culture changes maybe
26:11 the managers of Walmart's and big giant
26:13 corporations are all tattooed up and
26:16 pierced up and maybe they're still
26:18 rocking the goth and the Doc Martens you
26:21 know 30 years later I wouldn't bet a lot
26:25 of money on that but it could happen
26:28 stranger things have happened right but
26:32 where does God factor into all this
26:35 how many goth kids does God need to see
26:38 to be done with the goth movement
26:41 it depends do God's people create things
26:44 or are they just making themselves look
26:48 unique because you know it could be the
26:51 gods like oh wow that aired is cool
26:53 I did three Mohawks on one head one
26:56 straight up 145 on left 45 on the right
26:59 cool I dig it
27:01 keep going kid I'm going to give you
27:04 opportunities to keep doing this I'm
27:06 going to make sure you have enough money
27:07 to buy hair dye and hair spray I'm going
27:09 to give you more ideas I'm gonna hook
27:11 you up with some spirits that dig this
27:12 kind of stuff they designed the blue jay
27:14 and the dragon mantas just watch out
27:18 we're going to get you some crazy hybrid
27:20 of yourself I really don't think God has
27:24 any you know paradigm of judgement that
27:27 says no you must become a banker you
27:29 must become a doctor fireman nurse I
27:31 don't think Titus anything like that at
27:33 all if I said to you that you're a
27:39 symbiotic being between your soul and
27:42 your body the consciousness is what you
27:46 really are which is what we call your
27:48 soul or your spirit and I you know we do
27:52 a little graphic we pull the two apart
27:54 we say this is your body and this is
27:55 your soul which one of those two things
27:58 is in God's realm I think right off the
28:03 bat you would say your consciousness
28:05 your spirit that's God's realm not the
28:08 body so can we take the answer and
28:12 prioritize perhaps the dimension by
28:14 which our Creator might be more
28:16 interested if an alien race created us
28:19 that maybe they're more interested in
28:21 the vessel and how its maturing how
28:23 they're hybrid with hominids and their
28:25 own DNA created Homo Sapien sapien
28:28 on a intelligence level of metabolizing
28:31 brain waves and passing on genetic
28:34 intelligence due to lack of repression
28:36 for that particular get an extravagant
28:38 it's not a racial thing it's just if you
28:40 weren't repressed you might have more
28:42 neuron meshes and your babies and as
28:46 soon as you become repressed they go
28:47 down one sector get Sun repressed and it
28:50 gets more increased right maybe that's
28:53 what they're interested in how maybe
28:55 they're tuning us maybe the reason why
28:56 Hugh manatee has to sleep is just like
28:58 dark City the movie says so as we go to
29:01 sleep we get tuned maybe we don't switch
29:04 places maybe I'm not a baker tomorrow
29:06 but maybe the program by which I operate
29:08 on as made possible by my antenna DNA
29:13 they just send down a new program and my
29:16 body picks it up my wireless antenna my
29:18 wireless you know Linksys router is just
29:22 my DNA
29:23 you know you think you'd be able to
29:25 maybe track this a little bit through
29:27 studying protein patterns because that's
29:29 the instructions that make us go a
29:31 particular way right not our DNA neural
29:35 peptides and neuropeptides in the movie
29:37 what the bleep do we know are
29:39 scientifically proven to be these these
29:42 peptides that are sort of like stem
29:44 cells that can become whatever you think
29:46 yourself to be so if you think you're
29:48 healthy and you think you have muscles
29:51 you can make them simply by thinking
29:53 about them but if you have an a saying
29:57 sort of sickly opinion of yourself and
30:00 where you are in the universe you will
30:02 simply be allergic to everything
30:04 you'll always be a klutz you'll you know
30:07 you'll say oh you know I don't do good
30:09 with computers well then you'll always
30:11 lack the mental aptitude to ever become
30:13 anything but what you think you are
30:15 because by the time you sit down in
30:17 front of a computer those neural
30:19 peptides are creating so many phobias
30:21 and you just descend on your body that
30:23 you're unable to touch the keyboard deep
30:24 to realize maybe you're a goddamn expert
30:26 at it maybe your maybe your neural mesh
30:29 is actually totally lined up to program
30:32 a computer but you can't get over this
30:34 this artificial hump in your brain
30:40 let's take the spiritual side God is the
30:44 spirit realm of the consciousness realm
30:47 all right so if you have if you've ever
30:53 written a movie or written a story and
30:55 studied writing I'll give you a little
30:57 trick to give you some words to use when
31:01 you think about this side of the
31:03 consciousness and God as related to the
31:06 consciousness side of things there's
31:08 something we call the maturation script
31:10 and it's maturation as a longer version
31:12 of the word mature or to mature having
31:16 maturity found in a script it's a it's a
31:19 person going on an educational journey
31:21 to get over their current fears of life
31:24 right you see these movies all the time
31:26 so now when you ever see a movie where
31:28 someone is learning how to be better
31:31 there's a maturation theme in there
31:33 somewhere maybe even the full plot okay
31:37 so when we see children that seem to
31:39 have old souls how are you making that
31:41 distinction well I can tell you right
31:44 now a child that cries less with eyes
31:47 wide open that are now looking around
31:50 the room well my daughter was born she
31:53 didn't cry out coming out of her mom
31:55 they had to spank her to get her to cry
31:57 but very quickly she stopped crying and
31:59 she's just a wait she's just totally
32:00 sitting there completely alive just
32:03 looking around the room she started
32:07 breastfeeding within the first you know
32:08 15 20 minutes and she's breastfeeding
32:11 and her eyes are just kind of looking
32:13 around like oh is this what we do she
32:16 looked like a sophisticated person in a
32:19 baby's body taking in the universe and
32:22 what's really fascinating about it is it
32:25 took a few days for her to become a baby
32:29 it was almost as if she was shedding for
32:31 her previous education from a previous
32:34 life but she came into this world very
32:38 mature in my opinion and I've seen
32:39 plenty of kids that are like this right
32:41 you have the family that has the two
32:44 children and the one child is very
32:48 astute inquisitive calm relaxed doesn't
32:52 cry
32:53 can have something taken away from them
32:55 and they don't [ __ ] themselves well the
32:58 other kid can't be happy no matter what
33:00 happens to them just got a piston loan
33:03 they're selfish they're greedy it's like
33:05 they're against um some feral version of
33:09 a human they're new they're brand new
33:11 first time they've ever been here maybe
33:13 last time they were here they were a cat
33:15 so they're all you know loathing the
33:20 world in their own little you know cubby
33:23 hole somewhere in the house clawing the
33:24 [ __ ] out of your furniture with just
33:28 those little low-hanging fruit
33:30 methodologies to analyze reality it
33:35 would seem that there might be a little
33:36 bit of logic in the fact that God is
33:39 trying to provide us or perhaps again if
33:42 you go back to my episode creating the
33:43 universe there's another model of the
33:45 universe which is that we are the gods
33:47 we are here stuck in this stainless
33:51 steel bowl and we've created this
33:52 reality because what else you're going
33:55 to do right we'll get to that after this
33:57 God analysis here now we like to think
34:02 of God as knowing everything constantly
34:04 right we do we don't like to ever
34:06 potentially piss off the God by remotely
34:10 thinking any blasphemous thought the
34:12 perhaps there was a point when God was
34:13 learning how to add 1 plus 1 in in the
34:17 grand scheme of things we can't conceive
34:19 of infinity and so we're unable to think
34:22 ahead of God's existence and then have
34:24 God suddenly exist and have enough
34:30 technical knowledge and compassionate
34:32 knowledge to create what we see today
34:34 something made this we're in it right
34:36 now we're living this program right now
34:38 and no matter what model of the universe
34:41 you want to adopt whether I wear not
34:43 giant MMO in your opinion or whatever
34:47 this place exists and there was
34:50 something that potentially created it
34:53 that something potentially created it if
34:55 you don't go with the is theory that
34:58 something just has always been we have a
35:01 really hard time conceiving it up
35:03 because we're born we live and we die
35:04 right
35:05 but for those of you have grown up
35:08 around kids if you've even if you
35:10 haven't had your own there's always this
35:12 stage where if you live long enough
35:16 there's this point where you meet the
35:18 child and they're young and they're
35:20 maybe sweet wonderful maybe a little
35:21 bastard who knows right but around 25 to
35:25 35 if you live long enough to see them
35:27 grow up they become really neat people
35:30 no matter how much they were just
35:33 inconceivably acidic when they were
35:35 young or or too immature to really have
35:38 a conversation with you personally they
35:40 grow up and you have this amazing life
35:42 that you get to have a conversation with
35:45 there's nothing cooler than having a
35:48 really interesting conversation with
35:49 your own kid you're like oh my god man I
35:51 remember when you were crawling around
35:52 and bumping your head on the coffee
35:54 table and now you're telling me about
35:55 you know quantum physics it's cool or
36:01 when your kid tells a joke that's the
36:03 other good one too so for any of you who
36:08 have been there I should say you haven't
36:10 followed the beaten path you've studied
36:12 a lot more fact in fiction you start to
36:19 become more enlightened because you see
36:21 more as we say you realize that there's
36:25 an isolation to that endeavor because
36:28 you can no longer have willy nilly
36:30 conversations with folks and still
36:32 remain interesting are interested
36:34 yourself right and listening to it it
36:37 can be depressing if you let it get a
36:39 hold of you and you don't start seeing
36:40 the bigger picture if you've ever felt
36:43 that ever in your life for whatever
36:45 reason then maybe we understand God more
36:49 than we think if God is all-knowing what
36:57 kind of conversation does God have with
36:59 anyone that isn't the most trite boring
37:02 utterly predictable conversation that he
37:06 or she could have with us how do we tell
37:10 God a joke and make God laugh I'm going
37:13 to suggest that God's best friend is
37:15 infinity
37:18 God's best friend his infinity if
37:20 potentially us being infinite race not
37:26 of human of humanity not of mass energy
37:29 but of spiritual infinity that perhaps
37:35 there is a logic to us becoming more
37:39 mature as Souls such that we may commune
37:42 with God at some point it's a two-way
37:45 street
37:45 we need to mature up to the point we can
37:47 understand what God would say if God
37:50 were to not try to dumb down what he's
37:51 saying you know what if God started off
37:55 a question like have you ever thought of
37:59 the day what do you think that that
38:02 would be I could just assume if there is
38:06 a God a unified being that is the
38:08 central consciousness of the entire
38:09 universe having created all the
38:11 mathematics that keep us alive
38:12 sustaining us day to day not just
38:15 sustaining us as a universe withstanding
38:17 sustaining us on an individual level
38:19 like you pays attention to you
38:20 especially if you accept him in any way
38:23 shape or form forget any religion if
38:26 we're steadfast about being inquisitive
38:29 and teaching ourselves and trying to
38:31 sift through again what today has become
38:33 sort of this you know this fake news
38:36 fishbowl that we live in right again we
38:39 use whether or not we want to admit it
38:40 or not we use a lot of mass media to
38:43 figure out where we are what's going on
38:45 it's a sad sad thing but we don't have
38:49 to engage any of that stuff stay free of
38:51 that in your mind does not just sound
38:55 great stay free of all that crap live
38:58 your life day to day in the now paying
39:01 attention to your friends and family and
39:03 yourself and try to create a wonderful
39:07 environment where you can be educated
39:10 not only about the authors that write
39:13 books or write webpages or whatever you
39:15 want to do make YouTube videos but of
39:17 your own personal research in life your
39:20 own you are your own scientist right one
39:23 of the most insulting things you can
39:25 hear online is someone saying well
39:28 you're not a scientist therefore shut
39:31 the [ __ ] up
39:32 you can't have any opinions about
39:33 something because you didn't go to these
39:34 institutions to get these pieces of
39:36 paper to basically teach you yesterday's
39:39 pop science locking you into pop science
39:42 for the rest of your life making your
39:44 neck spurt right it's crazy
39:48 again the Hadron Collider and was it
39:54 France and Sweden the founding you know
39:58 driving PR personalities that drove
40:02 supposedly the designs of the collider
40:04 and what they're looking for a bunch of
40:06 [ __ ] fossils out of the 60s and 70s
40:09 hanging on to big bang stupid theories
40:12 what a travesty that they've spent 15
40:16 billion euros on a machine to serve your
40:19 Grandpa's old tired ass theories that
40:23 really if they were real which they're
40:25 not pose absolutely no benefit to
40:28 society which is why a lot of us think
40:31 there's some other thing that they're
40:32 doing again I don't think they're trying
40:35 to rip dimensional holes and all that in
40:37 horse [ __ ] but something but now let's
40:41 come back to us I think that there's no
40:45 excuse for any one of us to feel
40:48 isolated in this world as long as you
40:52 have enlightenment where you have your
40:55 eyes wide open you have filtered your
40:58 stress to keep your perspective of life
41:00 open you put your stress over there and
41:02 your brief case you just leave it over
41:04 there keep it over there in a
41:06 compartment and deal with it everyone's
41:08 somehow go in there and Christ I hate
41:10 this but I got to do it and you always
41:12 realize it's not as intense as you
41:13 thought it was but for the rest of your
41:16 time on this planet enjoy where you are
41:20 most of us this is an example of how you
41:23 can so easily do this how many of you
41:25 have moved from point A to point B and
41:28 as much as you may have wanted to move
41:30 from point A to point B you're getting
41:31 more real estate you're getting a nicer
41:33 place better neighborhood there's some
41:35 weird sentimentality with the pattern of
41:37 the place that you used to live and as
41:39 you're packing your stuff there's almost
41:40 a sorrow almost a sadness either you
41:43 wish that
41:44 this place that you are in it's not
41:46 working out for you could be picked up
41:48 and moved to a better location so you
41:49 keep your your personality that you've
41:52 worked so hard you built shelves and
41:53 hung up posters and you played music and
41:55 you made love to somebody there and you
41:57 played a great videogame there and you
41:58 had a great epiphany on that toilet
42:00 whatever and then you get to the new
42:03 place the new place no matter how
42:05 wonderful it is it feels alien it feels
42:07 strange it's all brand-new patterns you
42:09 you stub your toe on that thing you
42:11 forgot it's there now and it's never you
42:13 never had this thing before but what
42:17 happens well you you gain
42:22 sentimentalities for point B and point B
42:24 turns into what point a was right my
42:28 suggestion and my reason for bringing up
42:30 that little analogy is that you can make
42:34 the inside of your mind and your persona
42:38 your personality and your character the
42:40 deeper core of who you are if we're just
42:42 getting these 40 ism as an example right
42:44 there outer layer that you pretend to be
42:46 as your persona your inner core's your
42:49 character and your SuperDuper inner
42:51 furnace is what forty called your it'd
42:54 or your ego now if you do a good job in
42:58 your life and you continually study who
43:00 you are as a person and why you say
43:02 things and why you think things you
43:04 don't have to acknowledge it to anyone
43:05 else
43:05 you can start to align just like the Age
43:08 of Aquarius and all the stars in the
43:10 solar system go in one big line you can
43:13 align all the stars inside your personal
43:15 being and then what happens is you live
43:19 in a frequency of truth constantly what
43:21 if you wanted to visit every single
43:22 planet in our solar system let's just
43:24 say that's the way it works and you
43:26 choose to do it and the Age of Aquarius
43:28 where all the planets are in a big line
43:31 and you build a rocket that in a day
43:34 right you can hit all of the planets I
43:37 curse you have to go one way for Mercury
43:39 and Venus but you know let's just say
43:40 when I visit Mars through Pluto and you
43:42 can go in a straight line isn't that
43:44 nice if you don't and you just pick a
43:47 day of the year or the epoch where
43:49 everything is in willy-nilly place
43:50 you're going to have to have Rochard to
43:52 take you all over the place right takes
43:54 a lot more energy and fuel and risk and
43:56 all this other stuff well that's a lot
43:58 how our internal hemispheres of
44:02 personality work when we don't work to
44:04 align them with each other for instance
44:06 if you build a persona outside yourself
44:09 that is so completely contradictory to
44:12 your character then being a life kind of
44:14 sucks and we've all met these you know
44:18 these either the salesman or the soccer
44:20 mom that talks to you and almost a baby
44:23 talk with the soccer mom with the
44:26 salesman it's always this heavy thick
44:30 paint of optimism you know how if you
44:33 buy their product oh man you know it's
44:35 probably what you want you know and I've
44:36 been looking at you and the way you you
44:38 know I hear this type of guy you really
44:40 you know I think you're really going to
44:41 like it and that exists at this point
44:43 you're like whoa whoa whoa whoa stops
44:44 trying to smother me with your weird
44:45 technique of self-preservation let's
44:49 just have a real conversation that's why
44:52 a lot of us will always shy away from
44:55 news we're broadcasters talk like
44:57 they're [ __ ] robots or like we're
44:59 children right just talk man just talk
45:03 talk the way you would talk to let's
45:06 force them to talk to us the way we talk
45:07 to each other you know when I'm not
45:11 saying you know you know haul out all
45:13 your dirty words and your slang and all
45:15 that kind of stuff because that's
45:16 localized techniques of communication
45:18 just talk to me normal believe me it'll
45:23 make you say a lot less words you won't
45:25 have to worry about a pun all the time
45:26 or some metaphorical you know
45:29 metaphorical pun
45:30 you could just say minutes really
45:33 raining outside unbelievable look at
45:35 that crap Wow so God may want the spirit
45:39 to mature to a level where if you've got
45:43 a lot of time on his hands we can live
45:45 for a very very long time and perhaps
45:50 achieve a point where we can join God
45:52 wherever the dude lives and I always say
45:55 guys just as an example and we can have
45:59 that conversation it's rewarding for us
46:01 and it's rewarding for him now the other
46:03 I mean this could be infinitely
46:05 different ways right of course I don't
46:07 try to define any type of afterlife in
46:09 any way shape or form besides to suggest
46:11 that perhaps you
46:12 recycle but if you get to take a break
46:16 pop out and you go kind of answer some
46:18 questions you add that to your
46:21 configuration which is your spirit
46:24 you're going to be reborn ticket maybe
46:27 you take a break maybe you see your
46:28 relatives maybe you go watch a Prince
46:30 concert or get shake Elvis's hand or get
46:33 to be in an episode of I Love Lucy or
46:35 whatever right you get to have some fun
46:37 do some of those things you always wish
46:39 you could have but then you come back to
46:41 earth or some other planet you come back
46:43 to either being a human or spider or a
46:46 tree or whatever the hell turns you on
46:47 right and you go back in and now you won
46:55 you don't worry about how the paradigm
46:56 of life and death the resurrection works
46:58 because you're going to get to go back
46:59 again you don't worry about if you diet
47:01 two years old of cancer you don't
47:03 because you're like well who cares I'm
47:04 not really dying you know I realize that
47:07 it's going to hurt my parents feelings
47:09 if that happens to me but I know they're
47:12 going to renew too and all that pain and
47:13 suffering is going to be forgotten and
47:17 be interwoven as lessons maturity in
47:19 their own upbringing so the next time
47:21 that they that they get to have a child
47:24 and it doesn't pass away at two they're
47:27 living this euphoric life right I had a
47:32 discipline had some friends of mine
47:35 wonderful couple two utterly brilliant
47:38 wonderful people their first child was
47:42 Down syndrome and severely Down syndrome
47:44 and I think four extra chromosomes it
47:46 was something intense and the daughter
47:49 and she lived about a hundred no 444
47:52 days that's what it was
47:54 cutest little thing and she eventually
47:57 passed away due to complications of how
47:59 our body grew but the family you know
48:01 they knew this they were what they were
48:04 told is there was less than a 50/50
48:06 chance the child was actually going to
48:07 survive birth when I had to take over
48:09 its own food mechanisms and sustain its
48:13 oxygenation of his blood it may not be
48:14 able to pull it off and she was born and
48:17 she she's a little tough little nugget
48:19 and she lived a year and a half
48:21 and when she passed they were ready and
48:26 it they took a little bit time off not
48:28 much but then they had a second child
48:31 they had a second daughter and this
48:34 daughter's the cutest thing you've ever
48:35 seen your life and they run out and have
48:37 vacations with her they have a good time
48:39 they're both brilliant people so they
48:41 have good jobs and I see them on
48:43 Facebook posting their vacation
48:46 photographs and I can't smash the heart
48:48 button hard enough because I feel so
48:52 happy that they had another child that
48:54 they didn't give up on the process of
48:56 building a family and it looks like
48:58 they're on a off to a great start right
49:01 but if you had a conversation with God
49:03 and you brought that into your character
49:06 and when you're born I don't know how it
49:07 works or if I sees this even happens but
49:10 if it did it could be that you get a
49:12 little boost in the arm from the
49:14 Almighty after you pass but even if
49:17 there isn't that information exchanged
49:19 and until you reach some level of an
49:21 ascent where you can actually personally
49:24 say I'm ready to talk to God because
49:27 imagine that right now you're like man I
49:28 would love to talk to God to be great I
49:30 don't care if he has to dumb himself
49:31 down for me I want to know some answers
49:33 I just want to say I love you and thank
49:34 you for my life well one you can do that
49:37 any time you want I mean I hear an
49:38 answer back with words at least you'll
49:43 still get the same process out of being
49:45 alive something taught you something in
49:47 this world maybe you were a very angry
49:49 person in your previous life because of
49:51 the cards you were dealt because you
49:52 didn't know there was reincarnation you
49:54 thought you had lost it all and then
49:57 when you get reborn again you a little
50:00 more cautious whatever mistakes you made
50:02 you you kind of have an instinct you
50:04 know have you ever thought it was
50:06 interesting that you have instincts that
50:08 other people don't have and you go why
50:10 would they ever do that that seems so
50:12 stupid you know these kids that do these
50:15 stunts on Tianna on youtube right
50:18 jumping off rooftops and then they hit
50:19 the concrete and they break their legs
50:21 or was it the girl that swings to the
50:23 other girl who whatever reason crawled
50:25 up on the balcony inside of her house
50:27 and jumped down on the floor probably
50:29 broke both of her legs just idiotic
50:32 stuff and you're kind of going well how
50:34 could they be so stupid
50:36 maybe you did it in a previous life some
50:38 other way or you saw it happen or
50:40 someone else did it right in front of
50:42 you and you all learned the lesson the
50:43 person who actually did it and obviously
50:44 he's not going to do it again but you
50:47 won't do because you saw it you saw the
50:48 suffering it becomes a part of your
50:50 character right but now let's go off to
50:54 the one that I mentioned in the creating
50:57 the universe episode I believe that's
50:58 the one where and this is a theory I
51:02 struggle with but there's there's a
51:04 struggle to it because it starts to get
51:06 to this sort of human especially you're
51:09 raising a type of religion you don't
51:11 want to deny God I mean that's the thing
51:13 that was always taught to Christian no
51:16 matter what sect of Christian your
51:17 Christian be that you're in it's taught
51:20 as blasphemy right again the only thing
51:23 that was ever taught higher than
51:24 blasphemy was usury which is what
51:27 happens when you buy a credit card right
51:29 the model goes like this we exist who
51:34 knows if we have a finite number of us
51:36 or an infinite number of a number of us
51:38 we exist and let's just say and this
51:44 really you know you guys into hundreds
51:47 of episodes if not all the episodes
51:49 they're probably tired of hearing it but
51:50 it's it's really the Q continuum
51:52 algorithm in Star Trek which i think is
51:55 Gene Roddenberry's greatest creation was
51:57 the Q an omnipotent race of beings that
52:00 again seemed to have a more spiritual
52:04 consciousness form and they have because
52:08 they're at that level and they're alive
52:09 and sentient they can control mass and
52:12 energy however they want in this
52:14 universe so they're able to do anything
52:16 they want in this universe at a flick of
52:18 a thumb right snapping their fingers
52:20 they can destroy a population they could
52:23 bring a population back they can do
52:24 anything that they want if we lived
52:28 forever we would go crazy or we would be
52:33 bored you know what would be the
52:35 difference between living forever and
52:37 being a prisoner in a Cell at some point
52:41 you've done it all you've been
52:42 everywhere who cares if the door of the
52:44 cell is unlocked you've seen the hallway
52:46 infinite number of times you've been
52:48 every conceivable place in the universe
52:49 is that you could possibly be but the
52:52 one thing that's different is you've
52:53 always been yourself and even though you
52:56 amass infinite knowledge as being
52:58 yourself and you can immediately see the
53:00 benefit of being everywhere as a as a
53:03 mortal creature today
53:05 in the immortal infinity it is hell it
53:09 is utterly and completely the most
53:11 definitive definition of hell because
53:14 you get to a point where it just stops
53:17 now you might contest that by saying
53:19 well there's infinite number sets that
53:20 are infinitely growing and infinitely
53:22 divisible so perhaps it's impossible to
53:24 have experienced at all but geez I can
53:28 tell you a lot of people that have made
53:29 video games have made every video game
53:31 or seen every video game made and when
53:33 they sit in the room trying to think up
53:34 a new video game they're like [ __ ]
53:35 everything has been done a hundred times
53:37 it's been done with a hundred thousand
53:40 dollars and it's been done with a
53:41 hundred million dollars there's nothing
53:43 new out there now obviously it's
53:45 probably not the truth but it feels like
53:47 that sometimes right but if we live
53:51 forever there's the theory and I won't
53:52 belabor it too much here because it's in
53:54 the other episode in great detail but
53:56 that perhaps we have created this
53:58 particular infinite loop for ourselves
54:03 we deliberately erase our knowledge of
54:06 having been alive again such that we
54:08 don't go in some crazy loop and being
54:11 ignorant is blissful being a child you
54:15 know again there's children born in
54:16 really bad situations we're not talking
54:18 about those exceptions but overall you
54:22 know when you're on level one you're
54:23 having a good time you've got good
54:24 parents good location all the bills are
54:26 paid you're eating well you're sheltered
54:27 and it's just meeting your little
54:29 friends as going through all your you
54:30 know you hug your teddy bear on one life
54:32 and you hug your fire truck on a
54:34 different life right then the answer to
54:38 the question of why are you alive well
54:41 it's just because you can't turn this
54:43 off you can't turn it off and then the
54:48 subjective nature of what you're
54:49 responsible for and growing through each
54:52 one of your incarnations it's really
54:55 more loosey-goosey isn't it yeah I got
54:58 really smart in this particular body and
55:00 I became a professor and I wrote
55:02 bunch of books and I expanded the
55:04 consciousness of man and I created a
55:06 free energy system or whatever the hell
55:08 you did and the other life you never
55:11 left your six mile square Township you
55:14 sat on the back porch
55:15 you fished you had your beautiful wife
55:17 or husband you had great kids and you
55:21 never wanted for anything else you never
55:23 really cared what was outside of your
55:25 landscape that you could see with your
55:27 eyeballs in fact maybe you had this
55:28 fantasy that you could see 30 miles away
55:32 potentially because the world's flat and
55:34 you're like I never went there but I I
55:37 wish I had maybe one last things you
55:40 think I was thinking about the other day
55:42 I come from this little tiny town and
55:44 I'm wondering if there was ever a single
55:47 being that lived in new Kansas their
55:50 whole life and never left to go to
55:53 Humboldt which is eight miles away they
55:55 never wandered out and through the dam
55:57 or a field or something they just never
55:59 left the township on one level I hope
56:03 that never happened but on another level
56:05 it's almost fascinating that it probably
56:06 has happened and we're not talking about
56:08 people that pass away early you know you
56:10 might live 80 years and you just have no
56:12 reason to leave right the beautiful
56:15 thing about this question it doesn't
56:18 matter really what I say I'm just
56:20 pushing and prodding your brain trying
56:22 to get you to think about this hopefully
56:25 you guys are during this entire episode
56:29 you have been shouting at the screen or
56:31 whatever and saying your your answers to
56:34 these things and I'm hoping that you
56:38 have at least one thing that you have
56:40 felt very strongly during this episode
56:42 that has nothing to do with anything
56:45 that I've said for those you've had that
56:48 experience I beg of you
56:51 posted in the comments of this episode
56:54 and I'll say this for any of you that
56:57 are coming in from podcasts and you've
57:00 never watched the videos I'm not trying
57:02 to see you need to see me sit out here
57:03 and smoke a cigar y'all smoke a cigar
57:06 really
57:09 try to get over to youtube and post
57:11 something if you have epiphanies during
57:14 any one of these episodes because again
57:16 you know cheese in this last 4th of July
57:20 week and I would say probably jeez I've
57:26 had three or four comments in the last
57:28 seven days where and they're totally
57:31 different one guy had a great comment
57:32 about how the lunar lander would land on
57:34 the moon without an atmosphere how would
57:36 the engine push against anything it
57:38 wouldn't push against anything the whole
57:40 thing would go cratering into the to the
57:42 moon over come down extremely fast and
57:45 then try to put some thruster power on
57:48 at the last few feet as it starts to
57:49 kind of hit soil beautiful comment other
57:53 people have talked about how they've
57:56 gotten out of stressful situations and
57:58 just really cool suggestions for
58:01 episodes a couple of you have chatted me
58:05 on Facebook privately because my
58:08 accounts exposed in the private Facebook
58:11 group and someone hit me with one which
58:14 I'm going to hold back what she said
58:16 because it might lead to a really cool
58:18 episode I want to show my hands just yet
58:20 because it might be the other three
58:21 months or so before I actually get to a
58:23 point I can share it properly it was
58:25 serendipitous suggestion of something I
58:28 should go check out which matches a
58:29 research project I'm working on right
58:31 now and that's cool right
58:34 my hope is that this is not just a
58:37 sociological experiment but I'm sure it
58:39 is has a sociological benefit to whoever
58:41 might have created us to see us as a
58:45 collection of beings on the surface of
58:48 some shape right for me it is more
58:52 infinitely appealing and accessible to
58:55 think about it on a personal level right
58:57 you know maybe someone makes a really
59:00 cool documentary and everyone sees it
59:03 and it changes the entire fabric of
59:05 society and I love it when that happens
59:07 right but in you know it's hard to wake
59:11 up every morning and go oh I'm going to
59:13 change the whole world yeah you really I
59:15 don't know you can you totally can you
59:17 can write that song write that book make
59:19 that movie whatever the hell you want to
59:20 do
59:21 say the funniest joke that makes
59:23 everyone's brains change but overall I
59:25 don't think you can get to either one of
59:27 those any one of those high-end goals
59:31 we're going to affect mass media pass
59:33 sorry mass population without having
59:35 your own personal journey well thought
59:38 out I don't think there's any time limit
59:41 to it you could sit out here in the
59:42 porch with me and in five seconds you're
59:44 like you know my god you know I just had
59:46 a thoughts and you know it's my own
59:47 thought and it's amazing and I'm going
59:49 to go run off and do something that's
59:51 how fast it can be but without the
59:53 kernel of personal examination I think
59:56 it's tough to bring anything to anyone
59:58 right that's why I always think is it's
60:00 in a lot of subjects that one can study
60:04 one of the most appealing sort of
60:08 security blankets when you and again
60:11 small towns you got to do this and so
60:13 some people just born to do it and they
60:15 should do it so I'm not criticizing but
60:17 when you choose to be a teacher there
60:19 are certain subjects that you can teach
60:21 that you can teach it and it's it's
60:25 immediately valuable to whoever's
60:26 listening to you like mathematics
60:28 depending on how your rapport goes with
60:30 educating educating others getting them
60:32 to see the beauty of math and the
60:34 purpose of math you can teach that kind
60:37 of thing but if you're going to try and
60:40 teach something that is a very dynamic
60:43 career like computer programming or
60:46 something your problem there is that you
60:47 are chasing a tail that is never going
60:51 to be really accessible if you if you
60:53 graduate and say 2015 you're like you go
60:57 back into college you get your
60:58 educational credentials or whatever and
61:00 you go back and start teaching
61:01 programming and say 2018 well what
61:05 happens in 21 are sorry 2028 ten years
61:11 later how relevant is your knowledge at
61:15 that point I guarantee you you do not
61:17 have enough time to take care of
61:18 students and learn programming where it
61:21 is today what languages have deprecated
61:23 completely out of existence
61:25 and which ones are still relevant even
61:28 when I was growing up you know we were
61:30 transitioning out of basic and the
61:31 Pascal and from Pascal into
61:34 C and C++ then Java and it just keeps
61:39 running away from us right it's wild how
61:43 many teachers out there teaching about
61:46 professions they've never actually
61:47 carried they've never been that
61:50 profession before so how on earth can
61:52 they teach you how to get that job and
61:54 they've never had that job they'd never
61:55 even been on the interview before in
61:57 their lifetime all they have is
61:59 circumstantial information about a job
62:01 and that obviously has a very limited
62:04 use to you I think you feel me hopefully
62:10 this was valuable to you guys I'm very
62:12 interested to hear your comments about
62:14 this you can find everything on deep
62:17 thoughts radio com we have a locked
62:20 Facebook group the group has I guess hit
62:23 some significant level of members by
62:25 which I'm getting a fairly constant flow
62:29 of fake people so I'm just keeping them
62:31 all out of there if you think your
62:33 account was if you if you tried to join
62:35 the group and you were not let in within
62:37 say 24 hours or 48 hours especially then
62:40 I think that your account didn't look
62:42 real and so you should which you should
62:44 probably do is I think you can message
62:47 me our message the group and say look
62:50 I'm real please let me in and then we'll
62:53 we'll go from there but I haven't had
62:56 anyone complained that I've declined
62:58 their invitation so I think I'm so far
63:01 pretty accurate with that it's on
63:04 YouTube it's on iTunes it's on Google
63:06 Play if you have your own podcast reader
63:08 I use podcast addict on my Android phone
63:11 and I played in my car to proof my
63:13 horrible mistakes on the show just take
63:17 your mobile device and go to deep
63:19 thoughts radio comm and click the lower
63:20 right icon which is the podcast icon do
63:22 not attempt this on your computer
63:24 because you will just get the RSS feed
63:26 and it will look gross our subscriptions
63:30 are growing very slowly but again we're
63:33 we don't lose many you know that's
63:35 what's nice folks have come on board or
63:37 you know they know what kind of episodes
63:39 they like I'm going to get back into
63:41 more of the fun conspiracy stuff and in
63:45 just a few but I had just an old
63:47 well mning requests for more of the
63:49 cerebral stuff and so of the very loyal
63:53 listeners there's a lot of push for that
63:56 I am working on a new Flat Earth list of
64:00 subjects but you know the show goes an
64:01 hour so I've got a bunch of really cool
64:04 ones I think you guys are going to be
64:05 interested in the Flat Earth side of
64:06 things but I need to backfill probably
64:10 another 40 minutes before I'll be done
64:11 with that episode's design in my head so
64:15 anyway if you made it this far thanks
64:16 for listening take care of yourself and
64:18 in somebody else and I will see you in
64:20 the next deep thoughts over now
