00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:32 gentlemen gotta crank out a few episodes
00:36 here next couple nights cuz it's gonna
00:39 start raining for like a week next week
00:41 I guess I'm just building up my reserve
00:45 here
00:47 today's episode is something I have had
00:50 by the way if you can hear music in the
00:51 background so my neighbor's party across
00:53 the street playing stand by me right now
00:54 it's like a background check track huh
00:59 but today's episode is one that I've had
01:01 on the list for over a year so this
01:04 isn't just sort of frivolous little idea
01:09 I'll probably call it the rollercoaster
01:12 of life and the big thing about it is
01:16 that this episode is about the
01:21 difference between what you were told
01:22 your life is going to be like and what
01:24 it actually ends up being and it doesn't
01:28 matter how prosperous you are in this
01:29 world because man dies there's always an
01:34 up and there's always a down the
01:37 difference in dealing with this reality
01:40 is that if you realize this is the way
01:43 it goes and for you young folks I don't
01:46 even know if I have any young folks you
01:50 will learn what I'm about to say
01:52 painfully and gradually over time and
01:55 just about the time that you can deal
01:58 with it and expect its flow life is over
02:02 and so I mean depending on what kind of
02:06 person you are if you're more perceptive
02:08 that that statement is not exactly true
02:10 but what'll end up happening is
02:12 regardless if someone doesn't tell you
02:13 what I'm gonna just flat-out tell you a
02:15 black and white you could be wasting
02:20 decades of happiness or at least
02:23 methodologies of dealing with things the
02:27 landscape of existence in any one
02:29 particular country obviously changes
02:31 from one century to the other from one
02:33 decade within a century to another
02:35 decade
02:37 but what's actually interesting about
02:39 the way it works today is that we have
02:41 sort of their methods of controlling us
02:45 pretty well understood now that doesn't
02:48 mean we know exactly when they're going
02:50 to be doing what they do it just means
02:53 that when well it's kind of like you can
02:58 expect the unexpected more commonly than
03:02 if you didn't know it's like when I was
03:05 growing up I had no clue we had no
03:07 awakening going on at all so when they
03:10 crashed the economy I lost my first
03:11 opportunity to make a enough money to
03:14 live independent rest of my life and
03:16 then it happened again and it happened
03:18 again I probably dealt with at least
03:20 three big ones prior to waking up at all
03:25 which would be the recession of the
03:28 gorge of a senior era then there was a
03:32 little bit of a dip in the 90s
03:34 transitioning technologies which wasn't
03:36 an economic one and then there was a of
03:40 course the September 11th and then the
03:43 soon to follow crash after that which
03:46 was designed to make sure we all well
03:48 anyone that was a 18 year generally that
03:51 range really saw their future in war
03:55 because their communities didn't have
03:58 other opportunities so this episode is
04:01 gonna have a little bit of 20/20 bias
04:05 meaning the way that the world works
04:07 today
04:08 now I have been in the last two years
04:10 I've been in a couple pretty deep think
04:13 tanks with some pretty amazing people
04:17 one is a very famous think tank here in
04:21 Los Angeles and one is some some folks
04:28 that brought people together and well I
04:29 guess there's actually a couple
04:30 different things I've been in but maybe
04:33 like a third one but they're warning to
04:39 each other and there are really smart
04:41 people trying to fix this problem is
04:44 that we know that technology is now
04:46 starting to become a way of life in a
04:49 first world country
04:50 in terms of skill sets that pay the bill
04:53 sets right and so they know that
04:58 lifelong education is going to be the
05:01 trend of our lives what they don't tell
05:05 you in the middle events although it's
05:07 discussed behind closed doors is the
05:09 economic impact to you personally thus
05:11 your family that's your potential social
05:14 mobility and thus happiness right what
05:18 that spells in terms of the roller
05:20 coaster ride is you're gonna have some
05:22 ratcheting up moments when you're
05:23 educating yourself getting ready for an
05:25 incredible ride you'll have this
05:27 incredible ride and then you will tank
05:29 to some degree the Delta from where you
05:32 were to where you in depth will be
05:35 occasionally down in some cases it could
05:39 be so down that you don't even know what
05:40 to do now there's what we're going to
05:42 talk about all the mechanisms that the
05:44 human mind engages to survive these
05:47 moments so what I'm not telling you is
05:49 some doom and gloom story I'm telling
05:52 you the exact opposite which is we have
05:54 to acknowledge the way the world is
05:55 going to be for the next perceivable 50
05:59 60 70 years maybe even 80 hopefully by
06:03 the 20 80s we got this thing figured out
06:06 but depending on how old you are you're
06:09 gonna go through these phases and I want
06:11 you to protect yourself I want you to be
06:13 able to assess what stage you're in
06:16 because it's fully possible that you
06:18 could never ever have a dip at least of
06:22 an economic kind but because life always
06:25 throws crap at you people get sick you
06:28 know and again so it's like this
06:29 multi-dimensional 4d chess right so you
06:32 have your own personal health you have
06:34 the health of your loved ones you have
06:35 your economic health personally the
06:38 economic health of your spouse or
06:39 partner and so there's a lot of factors
06:42 involved right plus your friends and
06:44 your family I'll give you an example
06:48 you're gainfully employed and so is your
06:51 spouse so is all your friends but your
06:54 parents are old enough to get retirement
06:56 but they can't find a job anymore
06:58 because the way that the trends work and
07:00 perceive
07:01 this invisible ceiling which is called
07:05 age discrimination and so what if your
07:09 parents mmm isn't really prone to self
07:13 educating they've never done it before
07:14 but that's the exact thing they need to
07:16 do they can't really afford technically
07:19 to pay the bills but go to college at
07:20 the same exact time to gain a new trade
07:22 skill what are you gonna do there your
07:25 parent you love them you don't want them
07:27 to incur anything intense what do you do
07:33 one of the things to keep in mind is a
07:38 lot of folks and let me just give you an
07:40 idea so if you were say in the Midwest
07:43 and big money is never a part of
07:45 anyone's future in the Midwest they may
07:47 be a farmer or some renegade inventor
07:50 there's always been like one or two guys
07:52 in my hometown that any one point in
07:54 time they invented something amazing and
07:56 they were making tons of cash but they
07:58 can't pay for everyone's bills right if
08:02 you're in that situation and the thing
08:04 is is that your ability to really figure
08:08 out these arcs of life they don't you'll
08:11 never experience because you probably
08:12 never have enough money to buy you know
08:15 something that you think you might want
08:17 like a big giant house a big fancy car
08:19 whatever right of the people I know in
08:24 Los Angeles that have that kind of money
08:27 very very in fact I may only know one
08:31 person and she married into the money
08:34 and then divorced out of the money she's
08:37 the only person I know that really
08:39 spends money like the stereotypical
08:41 person does in in like Hollywood movies
08:45 I don't know anyone else that does that
08:49 most my friends who are probably worth
08:52 several millions of dollars you know I
08:53 don't asks but you just generally know
08:56 they're part of franchises that have
08:59 generated a tremendous amount of money
09:00 that they helped invent they live the
09:02 most simplistic life you could possibly
09:04 imagine
09:04 I do they spend some money every once in
09:08 a while hmm
09:09 well some of my friends live in homes
09:12 they bought for nothing
09:14 I think one of my friends bought a house
09:15 for like cash I think it was like
09:19 $100,000 in Santa Monica and I think the
09:21 house is probably easily worth 2 or 3
09:24 million before you could find a fan of
09:27 that person that would buy the house for
09:29 an extra million because they're a huge
09:30 fan you know if they can afford
09:33 he drove a 35 year old car forever I
09:38 mean it's it's just it was 25 years old
09:40 when I first met him and now it's 35
09:42 years old he just doesn't see the need
09:46 to spend money no here's the here's
09:49 where he spends his cash he sent his kid
09:51 to Harvard he goes on a couple vacations
09:55 a year one locally in America and one
09:57 abroad he seems to go to Australia a lot
10:00 as a matter of fact it's just kind of a
10:01 tradition he has with his wife and so
10:03 they spend their money very
10:04 strategically but if you were to see
10:07 them at any of these locations you
10:10 wouldn't assume they had any money just
10:12 a little bit right what I want to get
10:16 through by giving those examples is
10:18 simply that if you were to look at some
10:20 of the folks with a tremendous amount of
10:22 money who aren't trying to keep a
10:24 franchise alive by being on you know MTV
10:27 Cribs like where it's a it's a job of
10:30 theirs to prove how rich they are right
10:32 that stuff happens too right you will
10:35 find that what you have with the normal
10:38 income is what these people have with
10:41 massive incomes you know big incomes can
10:45 create big bills buy a house that's
10:47 forty thousand two hundred thousand
10:49 square feet and see how much that cost
10:50 you per month by a car that cost half a
10:53 million dollars and see what it's like
10:54 to change the brakes all that stuff's
10:57 tremendously expensive and your money
10:59 starts evaporating and because the trend
11:02 of money creation is typically not one
11:04 where you get a check in the mail for
11:06 the rest of your life that's the same
11:09 amount that has the same value you know
11:12 I've got friends with five platinum
11:15 albums that still rent rooms from their
11:18 friends you know these websites that
11:22 have all this Net Worth stuff I look up
11:26 friends of mine who I sit in
11:28 their houses and I talked to them and I
11:30 know how much they're worth
11:33 and and I know how much the worth
11:36 because they're broke and these wealth
11:39 websites will say they're worth 10
11:40 million dollars or two hundred million
11:42 dollars and I'm sitting there laughing
11:44 my head off I hope I wish they were that
11:46 amount of money but they're none so
11:49 these sites are all crap just so that
11:52 you know in some cases they're way below
11:54 what people are worth just so you know
11:56 but nine times out of ten they're I'm
11:59 Way over the way over I mean I know guys
12:02 that are just absolutely broke and these
12:06 sites are saying they're worth 10
12:07 million dollars not even if they sold
12:09 everything they own would they be worth
12:10 10 million dollars anyway and money's
12:14 not everything I'm talking about here
12:16 but here's the trend in the United
12:18 States of America as of 2020 you are
12:21 bound to make on average okay you could
12:25 be the exception if you are you know it
12:27 but you will make the most amount of
12:29 money in your life between the age of 22
12:33 and maybe 32 after that if you can
12:38 continue making more money you're in an
12:41 exceptional bracket of human beings now
12:45 you know hopefully find a company that
12:48 gives you at least a three to five
12:49 percent raise every year and maybe you
12:52 can do a 30-year run and a company maybe
12:54 you start your own company and because
12:56 you sell something very primitive that
12:58 everyone needs
12:59 you always have cash right people might
13:02 make fun of you know plumbers or
13:04 something
13:04 hey everybody needs a drain blown out
13:09 they need pipes replaced there could be
13:11 some amazing things so what I want you
13:15 to understand is that I want you to
13:17 basically find out in your own mind but
13:20 via your own definitions when you're on
13:23 top when you are living a life better
13:27 than you expected to live it or it's at
13:30 the peak at a peak level there's never a
13:33 peak where it's the top you'll ever be
13:35 at but at a peak level where you
13:37 recognize that you're really living in a
13:39 privileged version of your life
13:41 right when the biggest mistakes I hear
13:44 people make in their lives before
13:46 they've hit any any definable peak is to
13:52 not recognize the beauty of their life
13:54 before they hit this other peak right I
13:58 know friends of mine that are happily
13:59 married that have two vehicles two kids
14:03 the boy and the girl I got both right so
14:05 you get both experiences their kids are
14:07 healthy their kids are educated they
14:09 have little suppers and they have little
14:11 pizza nights and that kind of thing and
14:13 there'll be some stupid thing they saw
14:16 on TV that read in a magazine they heard
14:18 from a friend or whatever maybe it's
14:21 someone else you know kind of boasting
14:22 on Facebook about how great their life
14:24 is by constantly posting photographs or
14:26 something of places they've been and the
14:29 wife gets complacent or the man gets
14:31 complacent the husband and they start to
14:33 infect each other's ability to
14:36 appreciate what they have and the funny
14:40 thing is I know people that are multi
14:43 multi millionaires hundred millionaires
14:45 damn-near billionaires that would give
14:48 anything to have that little life that
14:51 that couple has who is starting to
14:53 disintegrate because they're being
14:54 affected by you know pop culture it's a
14:58 super sad thing and there are definitely
15:02 forces out there of which you're aware
15:04 of that are trying to keep everyone from
15:07 being happy because once you're unhappy
15:10 then they control you because in a way
15:14 they position themselves to make you
15:16 think they've got your solution maybe
15:19 you're not white and they make you think
15:21 that everybody hates you and the white
15:23 man is against you well now you can't
15:25 even focus on your own life it's how do
15:27 I kill those people that are you know
15:29 against me and I get rid of them how do
15:31 I beat them how do I get all insecure
15:33 about them you know I have friends of
15:36 mine who grew up in various areas with
15:39 you know I I'm only saying this from
15:44 their perception they perceive
15:46 themselves to have received marginal
15:48 education they talk in a method of
15:52 speech that is not broadcast speak right
15:55 it's not the way I talk to you they
15:57 embrace double negatives they embraced
16:00 slang into the everyday statement no
16:03 matter what they're talking about they
16:05 just keep it real but when they get
16:08 around folks the talk very normal I
16:12 would say right without any slang with
16:14 any double negatives very grammatically
16:16 correct they will sometimes they'll be
16:21 talking and they'll realize they spoke
16:23 in their methodology and then they'll
16:26 look and then they'll correct what
16:29 they're saying as if wery actually were
16:33 secretly rejecting them for the way that
16:36 they just spoke and nobody did but I
16:40 hate to see that that natural thing that
16:43 doesn't harm anybody go away as long as
16:47 they're talented and could pull off a
16:49 particular trade nobody cares
16:51 right now we know the mathematics of it
16:55 all yes if you go on a job interview and
16:57 you talk like that then people may not
17:00 hire you depending on what kind of
17:01 person you're talking to
17:02 again it's I'm all results driven
17:05 personally but on my own experience this
17:08 is the thing that and I've mentioned
17:10 it's sort of as digressions in other
17:13 episodes 200-300 episodes ago so I
17:16 wanted to sort of react the game here I
17:20 definitely so I had I had almost I had
17:24 almost had the formula that I'm trying
17:25 to give you in this particular episode
17:27 which is coming from the Midwest's
17:31 coming from like I've said in recent
17:33 episodes that have been aired yet that
17:34 you know we were not terribly wealthy my
17:38 dad and I really struggled man but we
17:40 didn't let it bother us right we had
17:42 some fun toys let me tell you and we had
17:44 some fun with our lives at the same time
17:46 so being broke we always found something
17:49 cool to do I mean with like own a
17:50 pinball machine we'd be repairing or not
17:54 [ __ ] we're doing we had all the tarty
17:56 consoles great television and stereo but
17:58 that's where all the money went you know
17:59 so eating was kind of like I'm gonna do
18:01 sloppy joes again okay all right
18:03 spaghetti spaghetti spaghetti and cereal
18:06 Cyril Sarah great so
18:09 when I gotten successful in California
18:13 when I first moved out and I would say
18:16 the first four years i SuperDuper
18:18 struggled man my bank account bounced
18:20 like I don't know like a you know red
18:24 rubber ball from dodge ball man it was
18:27 crazy but about four years in three or
18:30 four probably three years in it started
18:32 to stabilize a little bit and then
18:35 mid-90s being in the Bay Area Silicon
18:38 Valley later I live right in Silicon
18:40 Valley all through the 90s just riding
18:43 that wave of great employments making
18:47 gobs of cash
18:49 I totally appreciated what I had you
18:51 know like I said I slowly built up my
18:53 music studio over time and then did that
18:55 professionally for a little while but I
18:57 always had really kind of cool computers
18:59 I managed to buy two new cars when I
19:03 came out here you know before I was a I
19:05 would say a grown man always is able to
19:09 always was able to rent a fairly decent
19:11 apartment and eventually got into a home
19:13 about 95 but the thing that I never did
19:18 and I don't know to what degree I would
19:22 have needed to do something along this
19:25 nature was to really put away a bunch of
19:28 dough put away a ton of cash to survive
19:33 that that down era the roller coaster
19:37 going down right so it's kind of a weird
19:41 analogy to because the down part on the
19:43 roller coaster is the most fun and I
19:45 would say that that's sort of what the
19:47 way life works is that unless there's
19:50 like an economic collapse where
19:52 literally there's a day you're fully
19:54 employed everything's great and then
19:56 crash right which we had essentially two
19:58 of those in the last 20 years where we
20:00 had the 9/11 thing took about a year to
20:04 kill the economy but then we had the
20:06 2008 thing which was day and night man I
20:09 mean like I said several times on the
20:11 show clients calling me up telling me
20:14 they were losing their businesses and
20:15 they were worth you know 75 K a month to
20:18 my company and they were the small
20:19 clients right
20:21 now here's the other thing so let's see
20:26 how to best describe this so I got a
20:29 chance to ride for 10 years roughly from
20:32 91 to 2001 pretty unscathed man I mean I
20:36 didn't have any financial problems
20:38 always not only employed but I had a
20:40 side company the sort of product that I
20:42 wrote and I was always just generating
20:45 money from a million different ways so
20:47 once I learned the Internet you know I
20:48 could make money on the side cuz nobody
20:49 had any strategy for getting on the net
20:51 there was no WordPress everything was
20:53 difficult by the time that I was laid
21:00 off at EA with another thirty five
21:02 hundred people I was the last group of
21:04 folks and technically I was part of a
21:07 different thing or whatever but anyway
21:09 three years to the day that I started in
21:13 the online division to the day I was let
21:16 go because one day more and they would
21:18 have had to invest my stocks and of
21:19 course it was all a big [ __ ] scam
21:21 from the very beginning I had shares in
21:25 EA and I had some pretty fat paychecks
21:28 that I put aside because I was just
21:30 somewhat literally making double
21:32 paychecks for about six months and they
21:33 were already big so I'm like I'll give
21:36 you an example I only work for three
21:38 months in 2002 but I made 200 grand just
21:44 put that together so I paid off all my
21:48 credit cards all this other stuff took
21:49 the family on a vacation to the Midwest
21:51 and I pretty much had about 65 K in the
21:56 bank just sitting there but the problem
21:59 was I thought oh it's gonna be easy to
22:02 find out the jump I'm a the literally
22:04 the top of the game and I just
22:05 engineered a big giant platform had lots
22:09 of contacts and as I started making
22:11 phone calls to I made a phone call to my
22:13 recruiter that my headhunter this one
22:17 guy Bob he had placed me like every
22:21 single time you ever tried to place me
22:23 he just sent me I do the interview boom
22:25 he negotiates his salary how I'm in
22:27 right I called him up and he's okay well
22:32 it's a little tough right now couldn't
22:34 place me
22:35 my salary was you know deep in the well
22:40 I should say deep enough in the hundred
22:42 thousands that it was definitely kind of
22:45 a formidable salary so we even said look
22:48 you know just take it back I read I was
22:49 able I'm sorry I told him that he could
22:52 bring me down like up to thirty and a
22:55 total pinch it didn't matter I put
22:59 myself up that privately for 40 less
23:02 this is canceling bonus checks and stuff
23:05 like that
23:06 nothing I mean the 2002 recession was
23:10 just absolute for technical people and
23:13 I'm in Silicon Valley at the time and so
23:16 as chance would have it I moved down
23:19 here and into that house with a little
23:22 bit of savings to last about five months
23:24 now in the previous year I was spending
23:27 my money wisely but I came down here and
23:29 stayed at SIDS house and babysat his
23:31 house a couple times while he was
23:32 partnering with the Italy and traveled
23:34 Europe started filming a documentary in
23:36 Venice Beach
23:37 that's where I met all my comedian
23:38 buddies so I was getting things
23:41 percolated you know I wasn't worried
23:43 about cash or anything like that because
23:44 I had money in the bank Oh wouldn't you
23:47 know it by May of 2002 all the cat two
23:52 and three excuse me
23:53 all the money's gone I'm like [ __ ] what
23:56 am I gonna do now I started writing
23:59 checks out of credit cards when I still
24:01 had them and then it just it just hit a
24:06 point where I started I got a couple
24:08 clients that were starting to pay just a
24:10 few bills but they were like two-month
24:12 clients just getting my grip in this
24:16 area didn't know what he buddy down here
24:17 couldn't network at much you know it was
24:20 rough I knew Sid but you know Sid
24:23 doesn't pay my full salary anything like
24:25 that right so that's an economic
24:30 downfall that we all run into no matter
24:34 how much money you make they if you let
24:38 the bankers take over if he's like Joe
24:40 Biden kind of guys who rewrote the
24:42 bankruptcy laws that you could never
24:44 bankrupt and get away he wrote a bunch
24:46 of stuff to make the 2008 crash
24:48 possible which is getting where the n3
24:50 aggregate report just a bunch of
24:53 nefarious folks if they're allowed to
24:56 allowed to be in power over your country
24:58 in Europe unfortunately you're still
25:01 under their rule Britain just got out
25:03 thank God
25:04 then you're still susceptible they can
25:09 create a gap so big no matter how much
25:11 money have put away well I mean within
25:13 reason it's one of two things that are
25:16 just pure evil and bad and one of them
25:20 is let's say that you saved a hundred
25:23 thousand dollars it should be well the
25:27 worst thing that could happen is that
25:29 you've got them in really solid
25:30 investments and now the stock market is
25:32 crashing and now all of your inner grand
25:34 goes down like 30 grand you put it in
25:37 gold because they manipulate gold so
25:39 much it's just worth exactly what you
25:41 put in or a little bit less I put
25:45 $10,000 in gold many many years ago
25:49 wrote it out for ten years by the time I
25:52 cashed in it was worth exactly the same
25:53 amount as I put in so it was nice I
25:55 didn't lose any money but it was I
25:59 expected to make like a five to ten
26:02 percent nope doesn't make any money at
26:04 all but that money should stay is your
26:07 savings and they know that that's what
26:10 you're trying to do so they periodically
26:13 crashed the economy in every single
26:15 sector it's like a it's like a circle if
26:19 you add a circle a pie chart of every
26:21 single sector of employment in your area
26:23 of the world they rotate the cash and
26:25 they rotate the recession into those
26:27 areas so no matter where you are in the
26:29 world they drain your bank account now
26:32 if you're able to put away a hundred
26:34 million dollars you can survive those
26:36 those problems if you don't buy the
26:39 hundred thousand square-foot house the
26:41 ten you know million dollar cars and you
26:44 don't marry someone who's gotta be
26:45 entertained by money you don't get all
26:48 your kids enrolled in Harvard and then
26:50 they drop the economy and you can't make
26:52 the payments to keep them in to school
26:53 they find ways of doing horrible things
26:56 they'll also lure you into bad
26:58 investments as just a vulture is kind of
27:00 thing that they do
27:02 your cash but just I'm talking about us
27:04 normal citizens regardless how much
27:07 money is safe they can drain it and they
27:10 can create such a span in the recovery
27:13 process that it's an issue so what do
27:19 they used to tell us when we were kids
27:20 fine one thing do it better than anyone
27:22 else and you'll never work in your life
27:24 and you'll work for the rest of your
27:25 life I mean but you'll be employed for
27:27 the rest your life right
27:28 you don't make money there are still a
27:31 few professions like that but since so
27:35 much of our manufacturing is being sent
27:37 to overseas it if you're doing something
27:43 great someone will copy you and send it
27:47 overseas and then all sudden you have
27:48 nothing to provide so if you're gonna do
27:51 something like that if you think you're
27:52 in that sector of work then you're gonna
27:55 have to be extremely unique in that
28:00 process let's say you wrote movies and
28:02 you're really good at write movies or
28:04 you write music and you're really good
28:06 at writing music well music and movies
28:08 come with requirements right musics a
28:11 tough business let me tell you well how
28:14 long does one style of music ever last
28:16 10 years maybe 20 if you're super duper
28:20 creative but it's hard to go a 30 and a
28:23 40 it's just damn near impossible your
28:26 best bet is to make music so great that
28:29 people can sing it for one thing and you
28:31 can still tour the world with your old
28:33 portfolio with the music of the movie
28:38 business you better really keep you know
28:41 plugged into the trends and I'm already
28:43 talking about careers that almost no one
28:44 has ready so if you work in any type of
28:48 manufacturing any type of processing of
28:52 raw products you cut down trees and turn
28:54 them into you know two by fours well
28:56 that can be outsourced to another
28:58 country because it's cheaper over there
29:01 well I imagine that the default and the
29:04 dip that's coming is your industry
29:07 basically everything that you've
29:09 invested your entire life maybe it's
29:11 even your childhood fantasy to have the
29:13 career that you have gets
29:16 basically outsource it used to be the
29:19 idea that if you were a developer a
29:21 software programmer that you just be
29:24 employed forever China India and Russia
29:28 and South America as a matter of fact
29:31 now I'm program like like amazing so
29:35 what are you gonna do what's the Blitz
29:36 the customer gonna do it has to be a
29:38 customer that says we're a company in
29:41 Germany we only want to work with German
29:43 and programmers because of nothing other
29:46 than we want them to be able to come
29:47 into the office constantly and present
29:49 their latest version we want them to be
29:52 able to speak German and we just can't
29:54 deal with a lawsuit on a different
29:56 country that's one of the reasons why
29:58 they continue to employ folks within
30:01 your state within your country I will
30:04 tell you that the thing takes I've been
30:06 involved in they absolutely know that
30:09 we're hitting a technological revolution
30:12 to a point where the average academic
30:17 level of a citizen is below
30:20 significantly what it's going to take to
30:23 learn the technology that's coming that
30:25 needs to be created and so if another
30:28 country I mean I'll just give you an
30:29 example that's a little ludicrous but
30:31 it's a possibility in this day and age
30:34 that what if North Korea of all
30:37 countries were to recognize say quantum
30:39 computing and they just put whatever a
30:43 little amount of money they have into an
30:44 academic program to teach quantum
30:46 computing and they just become the best
30:47 in the [ __ ] world
30:49 at quantum computing okay
30:53 well then you take your average
30:54 snot-nosed you know American kid who's
30:57 you know complacent about everything
30:59 indebted uh usually coastal kids and
31:01 they just can't bother themselves with
31:03 learning science science is stupid and
31:06 blah blah blah blah ok they'll never
31:08 work in the industry ever a few nerds to
31:11 get into Caltech and MIT and a few other
31:13 places yeah they'll be able to continue
31:16 being the engineers at those particular
31:17 universities but now we're not talking
31:19 about an industry we're talking about a
31:20 handful of people so the other element
31:25 but I'm getting to is that you have to
31:27 recognize the long term
31:31 path of the career that you have the
31:35 more generic your career is the more
31:37 you'll be employed might give you an
31:38 example
31:39 let's say you're a great project manager
31:42 you're really good with logistics you
31:45 have a brain that can see a Swiss watch
31:47 all at once in your head and you
31:50 understand if there's a little bit of
31:51 wiggle and the watch and it's not
31:52 keeping time right you just have an
31:54 instinct for finding out what's wrong
31:57 okay that career can go all over the
32:03 place a good producer can produce
32:05 anything from an architectural project
32:08 to a fashion thing you don't know how to
32:11 be an architect and you don't know how
32:12 to be a fashion designer you don't know
32:14 how to actually write a movie or be a
32:16 director or a cinematographer but boy
32:18 can you make phone calls and get people
32:20 together you find out the pieces of
32:22 parts the first time is a little bit of
32:24 a rough ride second third starts getting
32:27 really well-oiled by the fourth and
32:29 fifth you're just cranking these things
32:31 out so much you could barely believe how
32:33 productive you are those are good
32:36 careers it used to be the perception
32:39 that like accounting was something that
32:42 was just a staple diet
32:44 everyone needs accountants he'll never
32:46 be unemployed hmm the problem with that
32:50 theory is that now software has started
32:52 to like Intuit with Quicken and they own
32:56 TurboTax model product well they can
33:01 pretty much take care of your books the
33:02 whole year round regardless of your
33:04 corporate S corp C Corp or LLC or normal
33:08 citizen it automatically can file your
33:11 taxes the more you use their product now
33:14 your accountant starts to go away
33:15 artificial intelligence starts getting
33:17 you the best deductions and you tend to
33:20 trust it more because it's not that
33:22 squirmy guy that's you know maybe making
33:24 you nervous about your return all right
33:29 so there's the outside to review at this
33:32 point there's an outside economic thing
33:34 that you have to control your elected
33:36 officials in order to keep from
33:38 occurring right we should be in a
33:40 recession right now in the United States
33:42 per the
33:45 periodic crashes but we get a president
33:48 that's stopping it for now they're
33:49 trying to use grunt avoid virus to
33:51 create which is [ __ ] laughable at
33:53 this point but they're trying they're
33:56 trying really hard as far as I've been
33:58 told the Europe is kind of in a
34:00 recession right home my friends in
34:03 Europe aren't saying it but my friends
34:05 locally who do business with those
34:07 individuals are saying that that's
34:08 definitely the case that's a huge bummer
34:10 right the second tier that we've
34:13 discussed is your own personal ability
34:16 to remain employed gainfully employed
34:19 with as much money as it takes to
34:20 maintain your standard of life you can
34:24 reduce the pressure on that second one
34:26 and the effect of the first one by
34:29 simplifying your life getting it down to
34:31 the meat and potatoes of what makes you
34:34 happy as a person we tend not to need as
34:37 much as we think we need and once you
34:40 just embrace that and realize that you
34:42 were either a sucker because I
34:44 definitely been won by wanting a bunch
34:46 of crap that other people told you that
34:48 you needed to prove to someone that
34:50 you're special right I always say the
34:52 kids who think get into alcohol right
34:55 because when you get an alcohol as a
34:56 child you're counting your beers you're
34:58 counting your drinks you're counting
35:00 you're trying to impress people
35:01 well hydron go case beers like whatever
35:04 I always tell them I said you know
35:06 you're trying to prove to someone who
35:08 doesn't exist that you're a great
35:10 alcoholic and if we buy into all this
35:15 consumption then we're trying to prove
35:17 to people that don't exist that we have
35:20 a boat an RV whatever a car that anybody
35:26 cares about if you think a nice car
35:29 makes you feel good period because maybe
35:32 the craftsmanship in the vehicle
35:34 inspires you to go inside your house or
35:36 go to work or do whatever you do at the
35:39 highest capability then that's a
35:41 personal thing between you what everyone
35:42 else thinks [ __ ] those people right now
35:46 I don't know about your country but in
35:47 America we don't save money we don't
35:50 save money for a couple of reasons one
35:52 most families can't and that's sickening
35:57 you're supposed to always be able to
35:58 make more money than you need was always
36:00 the case with the single income
36:02 household in the 70s families had
36:05 savings they went at least two vacations
36:07 a year and still had savings they still
36:10 were able to save for their colleges
36:12 their kids college education fully paid
36:15 for before the kid ever enrolls in
36:16 college meanwhile you're buying the kid
36:20 their first car you know their clothing
36:22 hair everything that they need right
36:24 today it is like you owe your kid a
36:27 $1200 cellphone with $100 plan you owe
36:30 them a $30,000 brand-new car because
36:33 they're crying over a used car right
36:36 they need the [ __ ] shoes that are
36:39 like you know 500 bucks a pair because
36:40 they're popular no you know you'll never
36:43 have any grandchildren if if someone
36:45 doesn't like me at school
36:46 considering that you don't find your
36:48 spouse in high school or below in most
36:51 cases trying to help them win that that
36:54 game in those sectors is ridiculous
36:58 you're not gonna find those people till
37:00 they're in their 20s and that's when it
37:01 all bakes off and that's when everyone
37:03 comes to reality because their mommy and
37:04 daddy doesn't pay their don't pay the
37:05 bills anymore right
37:07 if you're a saver and you could actually
37:10 get into savings almost like some people
37:12 get into like you know collecting toys
37:15 from McDonald's where you can hoard
37:17 money you know I get so crazy that you
37:20 live a horrible life for people you know
37:22 despise you it's like what it uh Dave
37:25 Chappelle said that he had to pay three
37:26 dollars to go to a school dance and his
37:28 father told him he doesn't have three
37:29 dollars nieces what do you mean we don't
37:31 have three dollars she goes how are we
37:33 alive dad basically saying I know you
37:36 got the money you just won't give it to
37:38 me but if you can rearrange your
37:41 finances such that there's just even a
37:43 few pennies left at the end of months
37:45 you can put away that's part of the game
37:48 of surviving the roller coaster now
37:51 again if you're independently wealthy
37:53 you're safer than those who aren't
37:58 but whatever you have your money in
38:01 believe me they can figure out ways to
38:03 crash the value of whatever property you
38:07 own whether it be a car a house a piece
38:10 of
38:10 and they can find a way you know you did
38:13 have a great piece of land when I first
38:14 met my co-host Kyle back in 1989 who
38:19 lived in Ventura any sick you know come
38:21 on my house and you know well hang out I
38:23 say cool so I go over to his house and
38:25 he never told me I guess it just didn't
38:28 occur to him he was living in a
38:31 neighborhood in Ventura where they had
38:34 discovered that prior to building the
38:36 entire housing tract they had dumped a
38:38 bunch of toxic stuff in the ground and
38:41 it all started bubbling up and so I'm
38:44 driving to this beautiful community of
38:46 homes I'm seeing spray-painted skull and
38:50 bones on the walls you know curse words
38:54 like we're [ __ ] and all this other
38:56 stuff like people just paint on their
38:57 homes because they're like it's not
38:58 worth anything anymore you know at that
39:01 time they were probably paying I don't
39:03 know three or four hundred thousand
39:04 dollars for these homes and they weren't
39:05 worth anything because it was in a toxic
39:07 spill and so they're all in lawsuits
39:09 trying to get their homes paid for what
39:12 does the lawsuit ever give you what a
39:13 house is worth mm-hmm not usually right
39:17 there's a lot of folks out there that
39:18 are called Preppers right they buy a lot
39:21 of food that buy store water they have
39:23 guns they have batteries whatever it
39:26 takes right
39:26 bullets and there's a there's an luring
39:31 process to becoming more and more
39:33 prepared well just put in that this
39:36 whole conversation of keeping yourself
39:40 financially also prepped for things that
39:44 they'll do right now it's going to the
39:47 third category because the third
39:49 category is something that you can kind
39:51 of prep for but then you kind of can't
39:54 prep for it at the same time and it has
39:58 to do with death right now when you're
40:02 young it's a beautiful world because
40:04 your parents are usually not terribly
40:07 older than you and your grandparents or
40:09 within a great age where they can still
40:12 come over and hang out and go to
40:13 amusement park with your grandparents
40:15 remember I went on a roller coaster with
40:17 my grandmother and her 60s it was
40:19 awesome but eventually people pass and
40:23 sometimes people pass
40:24 randomly right I've talked about my
40:26 buddies passing on this show all right
40:31 well this is a rollercoaster for sure
40:34 and there's definitely a difference
40:36 between your young friend who's appeared
40:39 to you passing and a grandparent passing
40:42 it's there's a difference between
40:44 someone who's been ill for a long time
40:46 passing and someone randomly having a
40:48 heart attack and passing right but that
40:52 can be a little bit of a dip that can be
40:54 depending on your perception of reality
40:57 perception of life it can be a shocker
41:00 and again it's not that you want to
41:05 negate having these experiences because
41:07 part of it is appreciating your life at
41:09 the same time when you see death you
41:12 appreciate life it's just this
41:13 interesting thing when you're broke you
41:15 appreciate your money when you're in
41:17 love you appreciate the fact that you
41:20 used to you know not be with anybody
41:23 right I guess I could reverse that but
41:26 there you go now I'm telling you things
41:29 that you know of course right so some of
41:32 this is like just a big reminder the
41:35 younger you are this might be more
41:36 profound but think about the journey
41:39 that I've had is very interesting you
41:42 know I would have gone to well I did go
41:44 to college for like I don't know
41:45 probably two and a half three years
41:48 total all the junior colleges I went to
41:50 never went to a four-year never even
41:52 tried to go to a four-year but you put
41:54 it all together and it's about maybe
41:57 three years so that would have been late
41:59 80s early 90s
42:00 okay if I date most my college in the
42:03 early 90s because I worked for the first
42:06 couple years when I was out here but the
42:09 idea was you could go get a degree and
42:11 it was immediately employable and this
42:16 is sort of getting at the maze of trying
42:18 to figure this whole thing out so let's
42:19 say you totally get me right you get
42:22 everything I'm saying it's nothing's new
42:23 but you still know that if you turn this
42:25 episode off in two seconds what I'm
42:28 talking about it's gonna still be a part
42:30 of your journey you know like [ __ ] I
42:33 gotta figure out a way to protect myself
42:36 insulate my
42:37 self reinforce myself such that I don't
42:40 end up slipping you know for my quality
42:43 of life
42:44 even as simplified as it might be you
42:46 have no money you have no money you ever
42:48 see a homeless person there's two types
42:50 of homeless people you know there's ones
42:52 that you don't know if they've ever
42:52 worked and there's ones that look like
42:54 they got on the street yesterday and
42:56 it's a bummer more empathy you have for
42:59 people you're like god dammit there's
43:00 nothing I could do you know like and
43:03 you're your life's on a shoestring
43:05 you know mathematically it's like saving
43:07 every you know abandon animal in the
43:09 world you can't do it you just can't do
43:11 it it's a it's a mathematical
43:13 impossibility same thing with you know
43:17 the the human equation now technically
43:21 speaking we pay so much taxes in a
43:22 modern world
43:23 pick any first rule country there's
43:26 plenty of money to help people that are
43:28 homeless but then you have to filter
43:29 them who wants to work here ever who's
43:34 never gonna work again okay if you're
43:36 never gonna work again you better be
43:38 elderly because what do we do with
43:41 someone that literally says I am a
43:44 citizen of your country which means you
43:46 can't just deport me somewhere but I
43:48 refuse to work what do you do oh well we
43:54 have laws to say let's just say we did
43:56 we have laws and so you can't just lord
43:58 her around the world okay so you can't
44:01 be outside just roaming around being a
44:03 menace to everybody huh
44:05 but you refuse to work who put you in
44:08 jail I mean it's a hard issue and what
44:10 if you're mentally ill because you're so
44:13 hooked on drugs or you know use your
44:15 panhandling to use drugs which is not it
44:18 used to be the majority people were like
44:19 that and I don't think that's the way it
44:21 is nowadays but there's issues right to
44:25 solve it's really really tough I
44:28 continue to watch these documentaries
44:30 and I'll just give an example that's
44:32 very interesting with the way we run our
44:34 country as it relates to this roller
44:38 coaster right because what I'm telling
44:40 you is the first two parts are purely
44:43 financial one is related to the
44:45 financial system that if we don't if we
44:48 don't elect the right politicians then
44:50 we
44:51 a bouncy economy right because they're
44:53 loyal to the European banking cartel the
44:56 second part is to reinforce your talents
44:58 such that under any circumstance you can
45:00 survive and make money even if you got
45:02 to do something you don't want to do
45:03 right you know when I was in my dip in
45:06 2003 like I've said in one of my
45:08 episodes before I did into programming
45:12 video games at one point in making some
45:15 websites and even writing music from
45:16 stuff but I would I went to my buddy's
45:20 pizza place and I just loved being a
45:24 busboy being a chef being a a clerk
45:27 going out and talking to the folks cuz
45:29 I'd never done it my entire life and I
45:31 had all this rapport from being a
45:32 professional corporate guy it was so
45:35 much fun sometimes the restaurant would
45:37 get overwhelmed and someone was sitting
45:38 out there ten minutes without getting
45:41 that water taken it was like the worst
45:42 version of diner - and I get that taken
45:45 care of I bring him free stuff and talk
45:48 with him and apologize and boy they were
45:50 just the most loyal customers after that
45:52 they were like thanks for explaining it
45:54 thanks for entertaining us and we get it
45:57 we understand you're not being negligent
45:59 you're just swamped because you make
46:01 great food right but until I said then
46:03 they could perceive it anyway they
46:05 randomly thought it was going to happen
46:07 right but I'm watching this documentary
46:09 on North Korea and it's one put out by
46:12 RT you can find it it's actually prior
46:14 to Trump being in office I was it's
46:17 about 51 minutes long something like
46:19 that but it's called the happiest people
46:22 on earth and having seen more modern
46:25 versions of North Korean documentaries
46:29 were there is you know this this North
46:32 and South you know
46:33 handshaking the president Trump and
46:35 shaking everything's calming down and
46:37 getting a little bit better this rt1 was
46:40 special because all the things you're
46:42 not allowed to film which is military
46:45 people in uniform this didn't have any
46:47 problems I don't know who created it but
46:52 they asked a girl and it was funny
46:55 because you expect pure propaganda
46:59 if I'm any answer that you get from
47:00 someone on these and these documentaries
47:02 but this girl said something that was
47:06 fairly powerful for me to see they
47:08 interviewed her and asked her you know
47:09 why do you think that you know Korea is
47:11 the best country in the world because
47:13 that's what they believe and hey
47:14 whatever they're in a little truman show
47:16 bubble over there right so literally if
47:19 you're at least in Pyongyang you
47:21 probably do believe it's it might be the
47:25 greatest thing ever right now rural
47:27 country area all bets are off but they
47:30 asked the scroll why is North Korea
47:32 better than the United States and she
47:35 said well I was told by my teacher but
47:38 she said that one of her teachers had
47:41 told her I think this is the way the
47:43 conversation went that she said you know
47:46 I heard that if you get sick in America
47:48 that no one will help you unless you
47:50 have money like you can't find out
47:54 what's wrong with you until you have
47:56 money all right
47:58 universal health care obviously it's
48:02 been turned into a trillion dollar
48:03 business here and so of course it's an
48:06 issue she's right and then she said you
48:10 also have to pay for education otherwise
48:13 you don't get any obviously she's
48:16 talking about college education and
48:17 she's right it seems to be seems to me
48:22 like your health and your education
48:23 which is something that we can get to
48:25 once we get the next four years here
48:27 should be heavily subsidized in a modern
48:30 first world country when a third-world
48:32 country like North Korea can provide
48:36 those things but provide it you know
48:38 badly with I know we all know about the
48:40 hospitals that are empty that are really
48:42 modern that have power cuts and all that
48:44 kind of stuff just brace yourself for a
48:48 couple of years from now you won't be
48:49 able to say any of that stuff because
48:51 their power problem is still there but
48:54 it's getting a lot better
48:56 it's interesting then who knows how
48:58 they're doing it right I don't mean to
49:00 do to defend things that you know have
49:05 bad elements in them but the other
49:07 interesting thing about North Korea just
49:09 as a side note
49:10 a lot of folks will criticize them now
49:13 the concentration camp thing we don't
49:15 really know exactly what's going on in
49:17 that situation you know I you know I
49:21 talked to my friends who are fully
49:23 Americanized folks from the region and
49:27 there they're not even from North Korea
49:29 but they're kind of like yeah be careful
49:31 how much you believe of defectors
49:32 because they're they're potentially
49:37 coached themselves you know but I've
49:39 seen a lot of defector videos that you
49:42 know at the double-blind them and all
49:43 that kind of stuff so I do think some
49:45 things are happening over there but for
49:48 being a third world country they have
49:50 managed to keep out so much of the bad
49:54 [ __ ] that we have in our country right
49:56 that just rots the brains of folks why
49:58 do you think we have so much pedophilia
49:59 in the first world because we have so
50:03 much [ __ ] porn on every goddamn thing
50:05 on planet earth right it's like they
50:07 build up the sexual appetite of a man
50:10 and even women you know that no one can
50:13 be satiated and so once they you know oh
50:16 I can't can't get some of my own age
50:18 well I can get it next to kids I'll go
50:20 work at a daycare or the Boy Scouts or
50:21 whatever and I'll or [ __ ] Church and
50:24 I'll you know get all over kids imagine
50:27 as messed up as anyone could say North
50:31 Korea is and we don't know all their
50:34 demons either but it I'm pretty sure
50:38 that the problem one of the problems
50:40 that they don't have because they don't
50:42 allow the Internet to come order freely
50:44 is that they don't have this perversion
50:48 now imagine they open up a bunch of
50:50 tourist sites and all of a sudden all
50:52 the perversion comes and some tours
50:53 rapes more than women
50:55 it's [ __ ] drunk and belligerent has a
50:56 huge fight it could screw up everything
50:58 anyway it's another thing you could
51:02 simplify in your life to get addicted
51:04 that crap let me tell you one of the
51:07 reasons why I want you to gain control
51:10 in these areas because it's important it
51:16 goes back to that statement I'd said in
51:18 a video that I don't know that I've
51:20 aired just yet but it's the old
51:22 statement that it takes a person
51:24 while to find themselves sometimes right
51:27 if you find yourself in one of these
51:29 dips you will want to have the financial
51:33 mobility to endure the dip and to figure
51:37 out what the hell you're gonna do next
51:39 and the more time that you have to
51:42 figure out what you want to do next the
51:43 more likely you are to do the thing that
51:46 you wish you'd always done something
51:49 really deep to your heart maybe you take
51:51 up painting maybe whatever it is you fix
51:55 cars
51:55 maybe you're just you know I mean the
51:58 it's it's pointless for me to give you
52:00 examples because there's a billion
52:02 examples of what you could do with your
52:04 life and if I say that to you and you
52:06 have something in you you just saw it if
52:10 you're not doing it right now you just
52:11 saw it in your head and that's important
52:14 and here's the beautiful thing about it
52:17 what you end up choosing could be
52:22 something that entertains me or serves
52:25 me in a wonderful way such that I will
52:28 part with my money to experience it to
52:30 get your services to get your genius and
52:33 you make money for me because I find it
52:37 indispensable in my life and if I find
52:39 it indispensable in my life chances are
52:42 so will two thousand other people you
52:47 know in your local area right and so you
52:49 will have a business on your hands the
52:52 other one is to do what I've suggested
52:55 several times let's say you're on top
52:57 everything's good maybe even have a
53:00 little money in the bank you could
53:02 endure two three four years worth of
53:05 really bad stuff you get some assets
53:07 dearly well okay I got that Ferrari I
53:09 probably shouldn't have bought but it's
53:11 paid off and if I run into a problem I
53:12 can sell it for 80 to 200 grand and then
53:15 if I had to and I'd be able to you know
53:18 finance yourself now here's the thing if
53:20 you think you're on top in addition to
53:23 being sort of a financial prepper by
53:25 simplifying your life to the point put a
53:27 little bit of money away
53:29 now's the time to make sure you're doing
53:32 what you really want and to probably
53:35 find the second thing you would like to
53:36 do the most
53:38 whether it be more than what you want to
53:39 do now or a little bit less than what
53:41 you do know and get good at it get
53:45 really good at it I'm at a point in my
53:49 life where I I write films in spurts
53:52 right and I think you bait for quite a
53:55 while and I just pushed through four
53:58 scripts really really fast and it was
54:00 three touch-ups and a partially sorry
54:02 yeah there are three touch-ups and a
54:04 brand new one and I'm working on more
54:07 but while I'm incubating I'd like to do
54:10 something else with my time and I like
54:13 to have a lot of high-paying skill sets
54:16 in my quiver because I just like that
54:19 power to be able to say hey I worked
54:21 four hours today but in those four hours
54:24 I earn what someone else makes in 16
54:26 hours because what I do is so special
54:29 part of it has to be my mechanical
54:32 ability to execute as part of it and the
54:34 other part is the style that I bring to
54:36 it right think about a musician they
54:39 used the same instruments while one band
54:41 creates a platinum album the other band
54:42 creates a piece of crap alright or one
54:45 that isn't that popular that's a big
54:48 deal so one of the things I'm personally
54:51 getting into and I mentioned it in the
54:53 episode of made last night is this
54:55 blender 3d product that I used to do the
54:57 intro and you know I've been in 3d for
55:01 30 years all kinds of different products
55:03 some products just got ridiculously
55:05 complicated just bad engineers I don't
55:08 know how to think straight and blender
55:10 3d which is a free product which sounds
55:12 like it might be crap because it's 3d
55:14 the CTO of Pixar said blender now does
55:17 everything our software does internally
55:19 so I'm not sure we're gonna continue
55:21 developing our software okay well I've
55:26 decided to use all my spare time to get
55:30 completely fluent in this product in
55:32 every corner of what it can do and
55:33 that's a lot of stuff right this project
55:36 I did for the backyard and the UFO it
55:40 was
55:41 you know I started off the year last
55:43 year I guess the top end of 2019 not
55:46 knowing how to do that with that
55:49 particular piece of software my only
55:51 alternative was to buy about ten
55:53 thousand dollars with the software and
55:54 then watch a million hours worth of
55:56 tutorials all right well I didn't have
55:59 to spend a dime Oliver came out of my
56:01 head I modeled UFO I watched probably
56:07 five or six hours with the tutorials and
56:10 had to do the compositing the camera
56:11 tracking and then my camera tracking was
56:14 way more advanced than anything you'll
56:16 find on the Internet in terms of a
56:18 tutorial because the pan was so huge but
56:22 I worked it out it's believable right so
56:26 you should have something like that in
56:28 my opinion just to create a really
56:30 comfortable backup and here's the thing
56:32 you could transition if you have a
56:34 really good career you can transition
56:36 into the other career at the same time
56:38 and hardcore listeners you've heard me
56:39 say this several times in different
56:41 episodes but this is based on the idea
56:44 of insulating yourself against a fall of
56:47 some sort especially the ones you don't
56:49 control one of the reasons why our
56:52 current president in 2020 United States
56:55 is so appealing to people that are
56:57 especially self employed is that we
57:01 remember especially about age we
57:06 remember America when it was kicking ass
57:07 when it was not if you were gonna
57:10 succeed it was how you were gonna
57:11 succeed because the American Dream was
57:13 alive in every country town
57:15 I mean seriously my hometown had the
57:18 world not changed and it was like North
57:21 Korea it's like in a little Truman
57:22 bubble and it never changed economically
57:27 anyway I could have sold shoes I could
57:31 have washed pools I could fix cars
57:34 whatever and be a nice like hands-on
57:37 kind of thing it had a real sense of
57:39 accomplishment at the end of every day
57:41 and I'd have enough money with just my
57:43 income my wife could stay on the raise
57:45 the kids she could start working the
57:47 second they get of age I gladly trade
57:51 places with her but that's not the way
57:53 it works the Midwest
57:55 but the economy changed the world
57:56 changed its in 221 there's gonna be
58:01 something that you you're fighting it
58:04 now whether or not you realize it or not
58:06 but they're at war with everyone I just
58:10 watched a weird conference in this other
58:14 video we saw my lounge today it was a
58:17 meeting this international group of
58:19 [ __ ] you know shells and espionage
58:22 folks like like government espionage
58:26 treasonous to human beings that aren't
58:28 American and they were monger American
58:31 one guy was American in this meeting but
58:33 he was well they were meeting to talk
58:35 about how they're infiltrating the
58:37 United States of America how they're
58:40 duping mayors and lower-level
58:45 government employees to become agenda21
58:48 loyalists writing policies to destroy
58:52 America and Europe I mean it's like
58:56 they're trying to set your place on fire
58:57 man so the big closing chapter for this
59:02 episode is the following we have to get
59:08 rid of them all right banking cannot
59:14 remain the way banking is right now
59:17 compound interest has to be the most
59:20 outlawed procedure in the world fees for
59:23 loaning money okay let's agree on a fee
59:26 sure as hell can be a hundred percent
59:28 right you cannot make a dollar for a
59:31 dollar right we have to pay back too if
59:33 you borrow one it's too high so we have
59:36 to figure out what we're willing to
59:37 accept as a decent rate but you can't
59:40 have all the GAR keys monarchs big
59:43 banking cartels big banks that just rip
59:45 you off the world has to change but now
59:49 they're anticipating that we want these
59:51 changes and so they're going to sell us
59:53 through shills false ways of doing it
59:56 right they were interviewing some IMF
60:00 executive it's been passed around quite
60:04 a bit this woman they were talking about
60:06 how they're gonna fix the economy and
60:08 she was talking about a unified digital
60:11 currency that might be gold backed well
60:15 that's still one-world currency while
60:19 real currency means a really easy way to
60:21 control everybody those dips and bumps
60:24 and prosperity moments can be utterly
60:28 controlled and thus because they never
60:31 want you to ever succeed erased let me
60:35 ask you if you had a little you know
60:41 think-tank comprised of proxies from all
60:45 the big banking families proxies from
60:47 all the monarchs and you asked them with
60:49 a truth serum in the room some gas in
60:52 the room that makes everybody talk
60:53 completely raw and you see you ask them
60:58 are you for any one individual citizen
61:02 of this world achieving wealth I
61:06 guarantee you without any speculation
61:09 every single one of them would say no
61:12 and then you ask the next question well
61:15 why wouldn't you want them to have
61:16 wealth what's your goal in doing that
61:19 well because it's ours and we control
61:23 everything and if someone gets rich they
61:26 could get up to our level and then we
61:28 have to listen to them another opinion
61:31 in the room another night on the
61:33 roundtable we don't want anymore
61:35 it's all about control baby if you don't
61:39 get rid of them then you'll never see
61:42 any in your life right you're trying to
61:46 master algorithms to prevent us from
61:48 ever achieve success why did they crash
61:53 economies every ten years it's really
61:55 six to eight number 2000 to 2008 it's
61:59 only six years the biggest non recession
62:02 time we ever saw was in the 90s because
62:05 of the internet explosion never take
62:07 advantage of all this money but the 92
62:10 recession lasted till probably
62:13 I guess it was 1990 Taylan in 1990 up to
62:18 probably about 93 we had the big
62:20 recession that just clean tech companies
62:22 out here in America it was horrific you
62:27 know it used to be that we would vote
62:29 for people and it didn't matter because
62:30 they had everything stacked right it was
62:34 picking from one of their two chili
62:36 candidates in any one position right
62:38 remember John Kerry running against
62:40 George Bush jr. they're both
62:42 skullenbones members I mean give me a
62:45 break right didn't matter they were
62:48 gonna get their way either way now we
62:51 know what Al Gore is all made out of he
62:53 was running against George Bush jr. the
62:55 first time mr. global warming total
62:58 Chile dude okay now a vote means more
63:05 than you could possibly imagine
63:07 brexit was able to get past that's huge
63:12 huge they divorce themselves from the EU
63:16 now every single country needs to get
63:18 out of you and what needs to occur I'm
63:21 just gonna say it is Germany has to get
63:24 out of the EU next if they could get out
63:26 of the EU it collapses overnight because
63:30 Germany's paying everyone else's bills
63:32 but Germany France Spain and Italy are
63:34 all broke because the EU and they're
63:38 just gonna get more broke the more that
63:39 organization exists the more that
63:42 agenda21 gets executed it's their first
63:45 goal is to reduce well basically make
63:50 first world country status a fully
63:53 genocided and extinct as a species of
63:56 people doesn't matter what race you are
63:59 anything they want us to be broke first
64:01 they believe in destroying it and then
64:04 building it back up but they're only
64:05 gonna build it up according to their own
64:07 notes up to a third world country level
64:11 well what the [ __ ] does that mean
64:13 alright what does that mean your little
64:17 shanty towns right little shacks no
64:19 power no like you know was it no power
64:23 and no
64:25 communication really with the outside
64:27 world remember the Hunger Games it's a
64:30 fictional thing but remember it was made
64:32 of these little villages all over
64:35 whatever land that was and the whole
64:39 thing was that they lived in these
64:40 littles you know dystopian horrible
64:43 little worlds and the whole thing was
64:45 that you would be privileged to get into
64:47 a game where you fought to the death
64:48 it's a lot like Stephen King's Bachman
64:51 book called the long walk
64:53 if you haven't read that book it's about
64:55 in fact it makes us because he also Burt
64:58 Running Man the same book
64:59 it's rage the long walk and Running Man
65:03 in the one Bachman book and the Hunger
65:06 Games are the last two books mixed
65:07 together which is that the long walk was
65:11 a story where you're in this
65:13 poverty-stricken agenda21 world and the
65:17 only way to get yourself out is you win
65:18 a lottery to get into the long walk and
65:21 then you walk until the last person
65:25 stands they made it sound like if you if
65:28 you stopped walking you died which is
65:31 sort of the Hunger Games algorithm right
65:34 but he tells the story you know where
65:37 people's walked until their shoes
65:38 disintegrated and their feet
65:39 disintegrated you know it's just
65:40 brilliantly written okay that's a future
65:46 there right the other big one is that
65:49 I'm not sure how much the consciousness
65:54 of a parent to a child is connected
65:57 anymore the reason why the boomer nation
66:03 the late forties kids are so gullible
66:08 and so buried in cognitive dissonance is
66:13 that they had parents from the
66:16 Depression era when you grew up through
66:19 the depression you went without but
66:23 because the parents of that era
66:25 maintained this idea that there to give
66:28 their children what they didn't have
66:29 they did too much and they spoiled and
66:32 they removed the hardship of life from
66:34 their kids so much so that when the
66:37 government needed to sell
66:38 ganda through project Mockingbird it was
66:41 100% successful all right my mother
66:44 still believes that Lee Harvey Oswald
66:46 killed Kennedy
66:47 she cannot look at evidence to the
66:51 contrary there's the Italian forensics
66:55 team that studied Barack Obama's birth
66:57 certificate
66:58 I couldn't possibly show that to my mom
67:01 even though it's a hundred percent proof
67:04 that there's only one in 10,000 chance
67:06 that that thing is actually real which
67:09 is their comfortable way of saying it's
67:10 a complete forgery can't accept any part
67:15 of that truth because that destroys the
67:19 Emperor still having clothes on but now
67:23 what happened to my generation the next
67:25 generation Gen X I'm in the first year
67:28 Gen X okay like I've said a few episodes
67:33 I lived with parents that got divorced
67:37 soon as possible getting tossed between
67:40 two parents getting moved all over the
67:42 place being the new kid in all the
67:43 schools never being able to trust my
67:46 environments I kind of had the the I
67:48 didn't get abandonment issues from the
67:50 divorce I kind of been him in issues
67:52 probably because I was moved around so
67:54 much that I was always the new kid you
67:56 know when I came to California I
67:58 controlled my life and they weren't all
67:59 stabilized outright but we were so beat
68:02 up Gen X and up right Gen X Millennials
68:05 and now the Zoomers they're our eyes are
68:08 wide open you want to talk about
68:10 conspiracy and getting [ __ ] boy my
68:12 parents were the first ones to [ __ ] me
68:14 over right I love him to death but
68:16 that's really the truth so my eyes were
68:18 wide open and they were so inbred to be
68:21 selfish that they did nothing with me in
68:25 mind at all right so I had to take care
68:30 of myself
68:31 maybe very self-reliant I mean I am I
68:33 don't know if I would take back a second
68:35 of my childhood to be honest I think it
68:37 made me exactly who I am which I'd
68:39 really dig but now when did we turn that
68:44 old Depression era mindset back on again
68:47 because in addition to protecting
68:49 yourself
68:51 it should be to protect your kids and
68:56 depending on your kids you may be
68:58 inspired to help them and you may not be
69:00 inspired to help them because they may
69:03 have been sucked into the pop culture
69:05 and you lost control and you know any
69:08 one point in time you [ __ ] you got
69:09 control and you feel like you don't have
69:11 control and then hopefully in the end
69:13 you make friends right
69:15 it blows me away that we have a well
69:19 actually it's not actually a case but we
69:23 had enough votes to make a communist
69:25 socialist a candidate for president who
69:29 worships dictators unbelievable okay but
69:36 our president who doesn't have any
69:38 affinity for these folks or how they run
69:40 their countries is being accused of that
69:42 kind of thing I mean it's this it when
69:44 they realized we were totally delusional
69:46 like the KGB gathered defected he gave
69:48 his interview in 85 which I love the
69:51 fact that some of you guys are
69:52 referencing this in the comments both of
69:54 Facebook on YouTube means you're just so
69:56 awake I love you spread that [ __ ] showed
70:00 that show that documentary the
70:01 three-minute version where the dude
70:02 talked about how we wouldn't be able to
70:05 process the truth if we were given the
70:06 facts because they so mess with our
70:09 brains it's just awesome because he's so
70:11 right
70:12 but the agenda21 people know that
70:15 socialism becomes the mother goose for a
70:19 disenfranchised disabled individual who
70:24 feels hopeless they feel like god
70:28 there's nothing I can do to get ahead
70:31 ever so I better go stand in line to
70:35 give a bag of rice or something's gonna
70:38 stop my kids height you know it's going
70:41 to keep their brains docile get the
70:43 extra fluoridated toothpaste with the
70:45 super fluoridated water I mean you know
70:47 it's it's atrocious so part of your
70:51 prepping and part of keeping yourself on
70:53 top is you know supporting your kids
70:57 having kids if you're cool and you're
71:00 awesome goth kids would you yeah
71:03 you can't see you're never too old but
71:05 you know you can be up there man one
71:10 thing is interesting about living in
71:11 Huntington Beach is that and I would say
71:15 knowing the rocker buddies of mine they
71:18 never stop having kids around here I
71:20 mean you see dads that are in their mid
71:21 50s with like three-year-olds and
71:23 they're making it work it's cool
71:26 now hopefully they put aside some
71:27 knowledge for the kid if they because
71:29 they're gonna die a little younger than
71:31 most parents but you know they're making
71:34 it happen they're having a good time and
71:35 think about all the wisdom you have as
71:37 your when you get older that kids is
71:39 going to be full of all of your best
71:41 tricks you know if I ever have a kid
71:44 again I've got you know how many hours
71:48 I've recorded with the 650 hours of this
71:51 I can just put it all away on our hard
71:54 drive and say okay you have any
71:56 questions kid here's the volume straight
71:59 from your pops you know I really do
72:02 believe in humanity you know I believe
72:05 in each and every one of you as I
72:09 believe in myself and if I can say
72:13 anything that will help you stay on
72:14 track help you get your dreams help you
72:18 fend off the those that wish to control
72:20 you for a nefarious reasons us getting
72:24 on the same page in terms of what
72:26 individuals in the world need to be
72:27 completely disabled permanently and what
72:33 kind of folks we would you know put in
72:35 place of those individuals you know
72:38 maybe it's you maybe you know it's funny
72:40 I was on a phone call with the guy about
72:44 some people running for office and the
72:47 dude said after talking to me goes he
72:49 goes why don't you run for governor and
72:52 it was for a different state and I said
72:54 well you know I'm from this state you
72:55 know it doesn't matter
72:56 people do it all the time they vote for
72:58 people they just believe that you know
73:00 that they can articulate well I said
73:04 I've got 500 episodes on YouTube where
73:07 if you know people wanted to crucify me
73:10 in front of you know average people he
73:13 was like oh okay
73:14 it was funny
73:16 in a different world and it could happen
73:18 in two or three years the climate
73:20 changes if we if we get rid of all these
73:23 chilly organizations and all these
73:26 crappy bankers and the world comes back
73:28 to reality guy like me could run for
73:30 office I can run for president because
73:32 there'd be like that dude was away 20
73:35 years ago but now we're gonna put him in
73:36 office but maybe it's you you know who
73:43 knows but if nothing else you being a
73:47 happy person will create happy kids will
73:50 create a happier world because it's all
73:52 a big bunch of consciousness right I
73:55 think they understand that when they
73:57 create events like 9/11 they're changing
74:01 the entire world's destiny through
74:03 manifest destiny make the entire world
74:06 feel afraid and you'll [ __ ] up the whole
74:10 thing to their advantage right that's
74:13 why you can't get all you know terrified
74:15 a corona virus and all that kind of crap
74:17 in my opinion at this point I you know
74:20 it's not like they can't kill us with
74:23 something else and blame it on that flu
74:24 but I mean come on so far it's the
74:26 safest flew out there it always is right
74:28 and they're canceling [ __ ] Olympics
74:31 and f1 races and just concerts and a
74:35 comic-con I mean it's just like crazy
74:39 how I mean comic-con is gonna happen in
74:41 the summertime right I think thank you
74:44 sorry there's Comic Cons of different
74:46 places sorry the one in San Diego is
74:47 gonna be like three months three or four
74:49 months from now can't remember if that
74:52 guy can still be a joke I mean if it
74:53 hadn't pandemics and killed millions of
74:55 people it's ridiculous like everyone
74:58 poop already like it get it out of your
74:59 system right
75:00 this is where mind controlling yourself
75:05 is the name of the game sit down and
75:10 design your life so dad I'm gonna go
75:12 yeah okay I'm doing this for a living
75:14 now yeah kind of like it it you know hey
75:17 let me just give you like the cheat
75:19 sheet on this whole episode if you look
75:22 at your career and you're like hey I
75:24 heard what the guy said I'm think I'm
75:27 pretty safe I really like what I do if I
75:29 did this for the neck
75:30 receivable 20-30 years I'd be I'd be
75:33 happy to claim well good then just just
75:36 keep reinforcing that job whatever it is
75:39 don't be caught with your pants down
75:40 right you know I mean I give you a like
75:43 a stupid example let's say you're a
75:48 assembly-line manager you've already
75:52 worked in the assembly line you figured
75:54 out how to build these cars or these
75:55 forklifts or whatever it is and now
75:57 you're the manager on top well that's
75:59 where one can get lazy right you know
76:02 that your salaries gonna continually go
76:04 up because that's just the way it is 3
76:06 3% every year even if you're just
76:07 average in an average company but
76:09 sometimes you need even more maybe
76:11 you're working a union where they drive
76:14 your salaries up every single year which
76:17 sounds good at first until you get
76:18 clipped and then it's like you get some
76:22 little pension it doesn't pay the bills
76:24 right whatever would reinforce that job
76:28 maybe you need to go read about robotics
76:33 because you're your summary line is a
76:35 few robots maybe it has none and you
76:37 know this is coming and you don't want
76:39 to get caught with some 24 year old kid
76:41 the pimples still on his face who cost
76:44 half as much there's a robot expert
76:46 because he got some degree you've never
76:48 even seen before what you want is your
76:51 big head CEO to come down and go it's
76:55 time we modernized what are your ideas
76:57 and then you're just all boom boom boom
76:59 well there's 10 companies that make
77:02 robots that do what we do but generally
77:04 cost this much I've been monitoring it
77:06 for three or four years already
77:07 programming works like this maintenance
77:09 works like that the deals work like this
77:11 and these areas of the manufacturing
77:14 process the assembly line process can be
77:17 rope roboticized and then these usually
77:20 are still done by hand ok great it looks
77:24 like you're the right guy for the job
77:26 all right girl for the job pow you don't
77:28 get fired in fact here's your bonus
77:31 check for saving me I mean a CEO a
77:34 couple hundred thousand dollars in
77:36 research great now what do you suggest
77:39 we do first you automatically you know
77:43 where robots are
77:43 most efficient and where your summary
77:45 line is most weak like well you know
77:48 what we have a big fault rate right
77:50 there on the manufacturing line and
77:52 these robots seem to do that particular
77:54 part really really amazing now we still
77:57 need human beings to you know put the
77:59 parts in place so we still keep the same
78:01 staff but they just put this in place so
78:02 that the robot can grab it and put it on
78:04 so guys sit and watch it because it
78:06 might screw up here and there blah blah
78:09 blah you get me right now I can check
78:13 this off my list I also hold these
78:15 episodes because you know I know there's
78:17 only a few of you that are really
78:18 interested in these sort of
78:19 self-improvement ones but again you know
78:24 the way I view these episodes is a bit
78:26 like this I believe that almost every
78:29 human being on some periodic heartbeat
78:32 needs to have someone that they trust
78:35 someone that they respect someone that
78:38 they believe is out for them tell you
78:41 the same old thing you know come up to
78:45 you and go wow you know you're really
78:47 good at that what that thing you do it's
78:51 just man you're really good at it really
78:54 I just do this so much I mean think
78:56 about it
78:56 in fact I'm not sure I should stay in
78:58 this career and your friend comes up and
78:59 says no man I I mean you can change if
79:02 you want I'm not trying to hold you down
79:04 but just so you know what you do is
79:06 amazing you know if you're a husband and
79:09 you got a good wife you should
79:10 definitely say that and vice-versa if
79:12 you're good good husband good wife good
79:14 if they're a good parent you know tell
79:19 them every once awhile you might even
79:21 get lucky anyway I think you feel me if
