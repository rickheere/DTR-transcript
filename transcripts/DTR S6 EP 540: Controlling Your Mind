00:14 so
00:19 [Music]
00:33 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:35 gentlemen
00:38 so we know that there is a lot
00:41 of pressure out there by outside forces
00:46 which the whole premise should make you
00:48 laugh
00:50 when you really think about it but
00:52 there's a whole force out there
00:55 that you let into your life in almost
00:58 every single case you let it into your
01:00 life
01:01 and it's trying to control you and we're
01:04 not just talking about
01:05 you know bills that you gotta pay and
01:07 that kind of thing
01:10 we're not you know that's we're not
01:11 concerned about that we're concerned
01:13 about this sovereign space that you have
01:16 between your ears
01:18 your instance relationship with your
01:20 soul that is
01:22 what i call your human life
01:25 left alone you would have a bunch of
01:27 interesting thoughts
01:30 once you start intermingling with other
01:32 people let's just say they are good
01:34 upstanding people they have no
01:37 wish to control you in any way shape or
01:38 form
01:40 it still happens it still happens
01:45 but obviously for many reasons it's more
01:47 voluntary
01:48 these are your friends your family
01:52 members so you don't
01:55 have a cow just because they get up in
01:58 you
01:59 i want to give you a spectrum of kind of
02:02 what i'm thinking about so that you
02:04 don't lose interest in this
02:06 we all know what thought police is
02:09 straight up
02:09 right someone's saying you can't say
02:11 that we're political correct
02:14 cops monday you can't say this wednesday
02:18 you can't say what you said on monday
02:20 friday something brand new
02:22 wednesday's a crime that's low hanging
02:25 mouth breathing stuff that they attempt
02:28 to do to you
02:29 and you can see it a mile away all they
02:32 want is
02:32 to have control of something in their
02:34 life so controlling you
02:37 makes them happy at least for that short
02:40 stint of time in the end
02:43 believe me no matter how much they puff
02:45 up their chest in your face
02:47 they go home and that mirror is the
02:49 greatest crucifixion for their
02:51 flawed instance of existence but a
02:55 friend of mine
02:55 shared something extremely powerful and
02:59 so subtle i had never heard it from andy
03:01 bonnet anyone else and in fact she had
03:03 to tell it to me a couple times before i
03:05 really understood what the heck she was
03:06 saying
03:08 now i've got a show on ego from way back
03:11 in season one which is on a separate
03:13 channel see deepthoughtsradio.com to
03:15 find that channel
03:17 everything's on bit shoot
03:20 but what i did in the ego episode was i
03:23 had you
03:24 separate delineate the difference
03:28 between your confidence
03:29 and your ego the confidence
03:33 that you're allowed to have can be as
03:36 high and as mighty and as amazing
03:38 as you want it to be because it is
03:40 almost an emotionless
03:41 thing other than you feel confident in
03:44 doing what you do
03:45 but it doesn't come with any sort of
03:46 sloppy emotion
03:48 something that would be demeaning to
03:50 someone else or make someone feel less
03:52 than
03:53 than they are while you're doing amazing
03:55 things next to them
03:56 you're just doing what you do and it
03:58 might seem amazing to them
04:00 and this is where you usually get to
04:02 become a mentor if you have
04:03 pure confidence and no ego the world
04:06 tends to look up to you
04:08 you know your humble athletes your
04:10 humble celebrities
04:12 your humble professors
04:15 humble people in your family just have a
04:17 lot of good wisdom in them
04:20 but what i did about ego is to say that
04:23 you have over calculated overestimated
04:26 your capabilities beyond
04:28 what you're actually good at it's a
04:31 sort of fake it to make it sort of thing
04:34 which fake it to make it can work but
04:37 the problem is is
04:38 you can easily lose control a good
04:41 example would be
04:42 if you jumped into an f1 race car today
04:45 in 2021 when they're super powerful
04:47 super fast
04:48 and you went out and you had confidence
04:51 because you are a race car driver you
04:52 know how these vehicles work
04:54 no one's going to worry about you much
04:56 in the pit when you're going around
04:58 because you're a pro but if you got in
05:00 that car and pretended to be a pro
05:02 to all of us and you try to take that
05:05 turn
05:06 and you forgot to slow down you don't
05:07 even know what an apex is and all this
05:09 other stuff you just made it all up you
05:11 thought since you watched enough f1 race
05:14 races that you knew how to be an f1 race
05:16 car driver
05:18 and you end up eating a wall at 230
05:20 miles an hour
05:22 no need to cremate you because you just
05:24 took care of it for us
05:26 that's the problem with ego but what my
05:29 friend said
05:31 what she said to me you know one of the
05:34 ways that people control you is that
05:36 they say that you have an ego
05:39 they accuse you of having an ego and i
05:42 thought well you know
05:45 i've definitely experienced it in my
05:46 lifetime probably not a hell of a lot
05:49 i get accused of being confident more
05:50 than i get accused of being
05:52 egotistical although the people saying
05:55 that other phrase might
05:56 might have meant to use egotistical i
05:59 don't know
06:01 but what does it do if you were a good
06:04 person you're not trying to have an ego
06:05 you're trying to have confidence
06:07 and someone accuses you of having an ego
06:11 well you might be like i do i mean i
06:14 don't know you that
06:15 well you're accusing me of this thing i
06:17 have to assume right off the bat that
06:18 you're
06:19 a good person before i accuse you of
06:21 being a bad person
06:23 and you might stop your life first
06:26 it's not the end of the world for you to
06:28 stop and pause and check yourself out
06:31 but what if you're really kicking ass
06:33 and taking names and someone makes you
06:35 stop and pause
06:36 well it's a waste of your life on one
06:38 level if you know you don't have this
06:40 problem
06:40 i'm saying this to you so you don't have
06:42 to stop ever
06:44 i'm proposing this to you so you can
06:46 check yourself
06:47 during this episode and go i think i'm
06:49 good
06:50 anyone accuses you after this episode
06:53 you can just
06:54 understand what they're trying to do but
06:57 if you really wanted to take inventory
06:58 of whether or not you're an egomaniac
07:01 there's a lot of categories in life that
07:03 someone could accuse you of being an ego
07:06 maniac with your prowess with whatever
07:09 sex you enjoy
07:10 your work how you walk into a room
07:15 how you do whatever you do in life
07:18 none of us want to be flawed so when we
07:20 are accused of being flawed
07:22 frauded flawed we don't want that
07:27 we're concerned you know when you're
07:29 younger you don't really care about a
07:31 lot of these phrases but as you get
07:32 older you start to realize
07:34 and i'll just give you a funny little
07:36 analogy and i've said this a couple
07:38 times on the show
07:39 little kids draw human beings like a
07:42 potato head at first
07:43 right they don't really understand that
07:46 there are
07:47 segments to the body the next thing that
07:49 happens is you start to see
07:51 a head being separate from the body then
07:54 you see arms and that kind of stuff
07:55 right they start perceiving
07:57 things as having more than they
08:00 initially perceived
08:02 the adult version of this is very very
08:04 simple
08:05 you start to realize you start to see
08:07 yourself from outside of yourself
08:09 fairly accurately that sixty thousand
08:12 foot view thing that they usually say
08:14 usually you need about six feet to see
08:15 yourself
08:16 it's a very difficult thing to do
08:18 accurately and it's something that most
08:19 of us will perfect until the day we die
08:22 and i don't think any of us probably
08:24 just to be fair we'll ever
08:26 perfect it we'll never completely see
08:28 ourselves outside of our bodies
08:30 unless we're having a near-death
08:32 experience or we're on some
08:35 incredible drug i mean if you astral
08:38 protect that's not very
08:40 useful to you because your body's
08:41 sleeping what i'm talking about is
08:43 you're moving around
08:44 you're moving and shaking and you can
08:46 see how you've approached others what
08:48 words you use what tones of voice that
08:50 you've used
08:53 i have practiced mixing
08:56 both the
09:00 um the thing i recommend you guys the
09:02 thing i do but my money more mouth is
09:04 i told you guys several times if you
09:06 ever have a
09:09 a strong communication moment that needs
09:12 to occur in your future
09:13 it could be something as simple as a job
09:16 interview
09:17 which could be on a telephone call could
09:19 be on a zoom call it could be face to
09:21 face or
09:22 you're angry at someone and you need to
09:25 have it out with them
09:27 but you don't want to be angry you don't
09:28 want to
09:30 exacerbate the situation someone you
09:32 love or someone you like you just a
09:33 buddy or a girlfriend or boyfriend or
09:35 whatever
09:36 you need to practice this stuff
09:38 somewhere else
09:40 say it out loud do it in your living
09:42 room do it in your car
09:43 if you don't have a place of your own
09:46 it's that's where a house becomes really
09:48 useful if you don't have
09:50 sharing the wall with someone else
09:52 because you have neighbors that might be
09:53 listening to you but that's where a car
09:54 comes in handy
09:55 because you need to let it out man it's
09:57 like those old
09:58 exercise videos where you have low
10:01 medium high energy levels
10:03 you need to try it at all three levels
10:05 and understand
10:07 what level you're on give yourself some
10:09 time between each portrayal of energy
10:11 because what'll end up occurring
10:14 is you'll realize how you know what they
10:17 call it uh silver tongued you are
10:20 how abrasive you are and or
10:23 maybe you're too meek i need to juice it
10:26 up a little bit stand up for yourself
10:27 practice saying words that allow you to
10:29 stand up for yourself
10:30 but then stop and measure that and say
10:32 man is there a way i could say the same
10:33 exact thing
10:35 and get them to understand me better i
10:37 will tell you as a screenwriter
10:39 this can apply to your to your real life
10:42 but it's interesting how it's seldom
10:44 ever done it just depends on what kind
10:46 of person you are i'm more of
10:48 my whole family on my surname side we
10:51 wound easy and heal fast which means
10:53 we'll typically blow up on you
10:56 of course as we get older it takes quite
10:57 a bit to even arouse any emotion on some
11:00 just personal communication level
11:03 because this technique i'm about to
11:04 share is what i love to do nowadays
11:07 if you are angry at someone it's usually
11:09 because you're hurt
11:11 and believe me this is controlling your
11:13 mind right
11:14 not everything in this episode is about
11:16 someone else trying to control you first
11:17 we have to give you some
11:19 some bits and pieces some techniques and
11:22 tools
11:24 how many times have you seen a movie
11:25 where two characters are yelling at each
11:27 other or one's yelling at the other
11:29 and even though it's kind of interesting
11:31 someone picks some really good words
11:32 some good tarantino dialogue or
11:34 something like that
11:36 it's still the least efficient way to
11:39 communicate
11:41 between those two people and yet when
11:44 you see some sort of
11:45 really intense drama
11:48 where the conversation has slowed down
11:50 you can hear a pin drop in the room
11:54 and the very subtlety of what this
11:58 exchange is all about maybe again if
12:01 it's you let's just put you in the
12:02 in the driver's seat you're trying to
12:04 communicate that you were hurt and
12:06 you're still hurting and you're pissed
12:07 because they hurt you and it seems like
12:08 they didn't care about your emotions
12:12 if you yell and scream obviously what's
12:14 going to happen is other person
12:16 depending on what kind of personality
12:17 they are
12:19 typically a good sweet person you never
12:21 have to do this to because they're not
12:22 going to be stepping on your toes and if
12:23 they do it's almost funny because they
12:25 had no idea they were doing it in the
12:26 first place
12:27 but a person who's just kind of stomping
12:29 around like a bam bam hurting your
12:30 emotions and
12:31 messing with your life if you yell at
12:34 them their instinct is to go into
12:36 defensive mode
12:37 prove to you they never made any
12:38 mistakes never concede to the
12:40 correction and now you're kind of worse
12:42 off
12:44 than you were when you started the
12:45 conversation because you're like man
12:47 i thought you did this accidentally and
12:49 by you defending yourself and taking
12:50 some position that you have nothing to
12:52 be apologetic for
12:54 this is who you are as a person is what
12:56 you think it's not actually the truth
12:58 half the time if not more than half the
12:59 time
13:00 but if you write the scene in a scoop in
13:02 a script
13:04 in a way that it is very subtle
13:08 and you start to bring
13:11 the amount of variables down that the
13:13 other person has to recognize
13:15 remember when you shouted someone and
13:17 you have like a
13:19 kind of a fight looking face on one
13:21 they're kind of subliminally scared you
13:23 might be
13:23 going to attack them because you've
13:25 never behaved like that before
13:27 they can't listen to the words coming
13:29 out of your mouth because
13:31 there's just so much going on
13:34 but if you slow everything down and you
13:36 keep the room kind of quiet
13:37 guess what the reason why you can hear a
13:40 pin drum
13:41 is because all the senses are on you've
13:44 alerted the person
13:45 across the table that there's something
13:47 you need to discuss
13:50 and you got to be careful about how you
13:51 approach that too because you can make
13:52 them think you want to divorce and then
13:54 they start going into like anti
13:56 well they start going to defensive mode
13:57 about that well yeah i want to divorce
13:59 you too which they don't
14:00 but they're just trying to defend
14:01 themselves again it depends on the iq of
14:04 the person you're dealing with
14:06 i assume everyone on the show is picking
14:07 pretty good uh
14:09 people to work with but sometimes when
14:10 you're at a job you don't get to choose
14:12 who you're hanging out with right
14:14 like your personal life but then you
14:16 have to describe it to him
14:19 and it starts turning into the other
14:20 type of tarantino movie like uh
14:23 in glorious bastards when the nazi dude
14:25 is
14:26 just torturing those other folks with
14:28 what could possibly happen because he's
14:30 got ultimate power
14:32 for those who haven't seen that movie i
14:33 mean the beginning scene is him
14:35 i think going to the french countryside
14:37 where he knows there's some
14:39 jews that are being hidden under the
14:40 house
14:42 and he goes through a whole circus where
14:44 he pretends
14:47 that he didn't find him and he's gone he
14:51 just wants to clarify something with
14:52 this guy really quick
14:54 and he realizes that the people down
14:56 below don't speak english
14:58 i think that's how it goes and so he
14:59 started speaking english
15:02 to this french guy and which helps us
15:05 out as the audience and then we
15:09 hear that he knows they're down there
15:10 and he goes if you don't
15:13 turn them over to us then we're gonna
15:15 kill you and all your daughters
15:18 but it's so quiet and it's so slow and
15:21 it's so
15:21 evil now that's for the dark side
15:26 but you can use those same exact
15:27 techniques for good
15:30 and i'll give you a screenwriting
15:31 example if you happen to find that just
15:32 a little bit
15:34 esoteric i don't think you do but let's
15:36 just think about this
15:38 think about some sort of hero
15:41 in a movie or in the bible perhaps
15:45 now there's a story of jesus getting so
15:47 mad he actually physically did something
15:49 in the temple
15:50 turned over the money changers tables
15:51 and that kind of stuff but for the most
15:53 part he was a pretty cool dude right
15:55 even just as a story if he's if that's
15:57 not your savior it doesn't matter
16:00 get someone like that in your mind male
16:02 female doesn't matter but someone who
16:04 you think would hold their cool
16:06 under pressure but they still need to
16:08 affect change in their life
16:10 they still need to super duper
16:11 communicate across the table
16:15 but something's wrong
16:18 i guarantee if you can get the words
16:20 constructed to communicate
16:22 two things what is wrong and how it made
16:25 you feel
16:26 if you can slow everything down what
16:28 you'll end up finding out is you have a
16:30 natural protection
16:33 for overdoing it you may even go into
16:37 this exercise so pissed off about
16:38 something
16:39 and then when you play it down into this
16:41 nice slow drama
16:42 you hear the words coming out of your
16:44 mouth before you actually engage the
16:46 person that needs to
16:47 listen to you and you're just kind of
16:50 like you know what i'm over it
16:52 i'm over it man this isn't that big of a
16:54 deal i thought it was
16:56 it definitely hurt and maybe you find
16:59 out it's not a mountain it's a mohill
17:01 and so when you uh do talk to them about
17:04 it
17:05 you can just kind of go in i don't mean
17:07 to you know
17:08 freak out or whatever but or criticize
17:11 you in any way shape or form but that
17:13 whole thing kind of annoyed me
17:15 you know i'm not pissed off or anything
17:16 but it's just if we could avoid doing
17:18 that particular thing it'd be great
17:21 again i love you but this is not one i
17:24 really enjoyed
17:26 and you'll find out what people are made
17:27 out of a good person will go
17:29 man i'm sorry i totally didn't you know
17:31 understand that and if they're like
17:32 screw you
17:34 up then you probably should ditch them
17:37 or if you work with them keep your
17:39 distance right
17:40 it's obviously very difficult in a work
17:42 environment
17:44 so be very careful with that one because
17:46 a lot of times it can come with
17:47 ramifications
17:50 but now let's go back to the other side
17:51 of the fence
17:54 the world of people trying to control
17:56 your mind
17:58 what's interesting about this is the
18:00 next statement i'm going to say i think
18:01 is
18:02 pure irony i feel like i must repeat
18:09 often the subtle truth
18:13 the repetition is the number one form of
18:16 brainwashing
18:18 when i first heard that i think it was
18:20 probably around 2005. it was probably
18:24 a guy in austin texas
18:27 honestly i really think that's where i
18:29 first heard it
18:31 it could be david ike as well but what
18:34 i've done in the last 15 years is i've
18:36 watched that
18:37 algorithm and i said is that really true
18:39 repetition repetition repetition
18:41 repetition and the answer is
18:43 unequivocally yes no matter how
18:45 strong-willed you are
18:48 whether or not you actually physically
18:50 engage in something they're trying to
18:51 get you to do
18:54 your mind will vacillate because
18:57 one you don't want to fight some
19:00 consciousness
19:01 war in your head
19:04 every day you don't do that
19:07 the whole uh 2020 thing
19:10 people constantly putting these you know
19:13 strangulation devices on them
19:16 you see it and you just like i mean for
19:19 some
19:19 people makes complete sense and for
19:21 others you're just like
19:23 why it just seems strange and you know
19:25 you could even have the opinion like me
19:27 where you're like
19:27 i don't really care what you do it seems
19:30 strange to me
19:32 but there's a lot of um locations that
19:34 you have to wear them to go in to get
19:35 like a bottle of water man
19:38 and you don't want to deal with their bs
19:41 so you just clip it on for
19:43 you know whatever five minutes you get
19:44 your stuff get the hell out
19:46 nobody there wants to be wearing this
19:48 stuff anyway at least to where i live
19:50 so we all just kind of appease each
19:51 other
19:53 i'm probably still under a dozen times
19:56 but the repetition can get on you
19:59 but how do we get the information
20:01 repeated into our brains
20:03 that's the big question and how much of
20:06 this
20:07 acidic weird brainwashing thing can we
20:10 quiet after november 3rd in the united
20:14 states of america 2020 i
20:16 ceased going to a bunch of media outlets
20:21 and the suggested replacements uh
20:24 eventually kind of turned into
20:27 pretty much the same thing i only go to
20:30 one and i don't want to mention it to
20:32 you so you can make your choice
20:34 i only go to one and it's kind of e
20:35 whatever
20:37 i prefer to get it from people that i
20:40 that i believe in
20:41 and that yields back to the msm killer
20:45 episode that i did
20:47 still working on the white paper for
20:48 that but you know me i study
20:52 i study tv maybe not everybody knows
20:55 that
20:56 those of you been with the show for a
20:58 long time know that that's what i do
21:00 but i'll watch entire seasons i mean i'm
21:03 sorry entire
21:05 shows all the way through mash
21:09 taxi is what i'm working on now cheers
21:12 frasier i watch it i watch it to see
21:17 what it's trying to do and what's very
21:19 very interesting
21:20 is the seasons and shows that i've
21:23 watched in the 21st century
21:25 are so blatantly on point for what
21:28 they're trying to do
21:29 there's no subtlety anymore with virtue
21:31 signaling inside of a show script
21:34 you can see it we all see it that's why
21:36 we hate
21:37 so many shows that are out there
21:39 especially the remakes of movies that
21:41 destroy things
21:44 it's gross you know and i've got a
21:49 i guess i'm hanging out with the right
21:50 ladies because the ladies i'm hanging
21:52 out with they're all telling me
21:54 it's gross they can't stand it they feel
21:57 like the women that they are
21:59 which are strong omega females they're
22:01 not being represented anywhere in film
22:04 it's these super out of balance mentally
22:06 ill alpha females
22:08 who can never be that they can never
22:10 really achieve that
22:12 that manliness regardless if they gain a
22:14 bunch of weight and mistaking that for
22:16 muscle
22:16 or they do gain all that muscle and so
22:18 they get into some fight with somebody
22:20 they're still never going to be a male
22:22 and they're not interested in being a
22:24 strong female
22:26 it's strange it's sort of like um
22:29 the ongoing mystery of the way that men
22:32 try to sound feminine when they
22:34 like the same sex in california here we
22:38 got a lot of that and
22:40 you know we kind of pull back and go man
22:42 what what who are they imitating because
22:44 no one in the world
22:45 sounds like that voice it doesn't sound
22:48 like a female voice
22:49 it sounds like some weird hybrid weird
22:52 thing it's interesting these are very
22:54 brilliant people
22:55 and most people i know that are like
22:57 that don't try to change their voice at
22:58 all they just
22:59 are who they are and they like what they
23:01 like and it's you wouldn't even know
23:03 it's interesting you can do whatever you
23:05 want i support that
23:06 it's just a weird anomaly right but back
23:10 in the day when they were trying to
23:12 really affect change and do it sort of
23:15 in a super subtle way because if they
23:16 had told society
23:18 in this particular show this is what
23:20 we're trying to do
23:22 the public would have rejected the show
23:23 and it wouldn't have succeeded
23:27 it's very interesting think about all
23:30 the shows
23:31 that let's say you're it doesn't really
23:33 matter how old you are but let's name
23:36 some shows that maybe some of you guys
23:38 saw when you were kids
23:39 because it's sort of a rerun syndication
23:41 thing for young kids
23:43 but leave it to beaver brady bunch
23:46 maybe the partridge family i wasn't a
23:48 big partridge family kid
23:50 all those shows in the 70s
23:54 that were seemingly pretty wholesome you
23:56 know like you're um
23:58 i can't i haven't binged watched facts
24:00 of life since i was a little kid
24:02 but the jeffersons and good times and
24:05 um those shows seemed to be pretty
24:09 pretty on point straight up
24:11 representation of life in those
24:12 particular areas with a lot of comedy
24:14 spin to them
24:16 but there was a nuclear family and then
24:19 like facts of life was like a little
24:20 orphanage the kids were
24:22 struggling to create that with each
24:24 other which was kind of endearing
24:26 but today and even with those old shows
24:31 it started to erode the sanctity of a
24:33 nuclear family
24:34 especially the sanctity of marriage and
24:38 you know infidelity versus fidelity
24:41 you know imagine this scenario and i
24:44 think most of you
24:45 probably over 40 but a lot of you kids
24:47 too that just really dig like [ __ ] anime
24:49 and stuff but the older you
24:50 are the more this is going to be the
24:52 case you've seen
24:54 sci-fi television shows or sci-fi movies
24:57 where they
24:58 are way in the future someone has time
25:01 traveled
25:02 so there's a nice comparison there
25:05 and in the future world things are
25:08 different especially what is a
25:09 demolition man with
25:11 arnold schwarzenegger and wesley snipes
25:14 he gets to the future he gets thought
25:16 out and he gets frozen and he gets
25:17 thought out to fight a crime criminal in
25:19 the future
25:20 it's a pretty damn cool premise and it
25:22 was so easily done and beautifully done
25:25 but he goes into the future and he finds
25:26 out that swearing is not allowed in
25:28 public
25:29 and everywhere he swears there's a
25:32 there's a little
25:33 pillar that gives you a ticket oh you
25:36 know you did this thing it keeps giving
25:37 you a ticket you have to take the ticket
25:39 and pay it somewhere
25:41 and of course if you think it through
25:43 for a split second that
25:44 that world would have an automatic
25:46 credit system like a centralized economy
25:48 and you would just take it away from
25:50 your income you wouldn't have to get the
25:51 ticket
25:52 you would have to get a piece of paper
25:53 anyway at one point arnold
25:55 or was it uh sorry sylvester stallone
25:57 goes to go the bathroom and he can't
25:58 figure out
25:59 there's some seashells in there and he
26:01 can't figure out how to work them
26:03 and they make fun of him because he
26:04 doesn't know how to work the shelves i
26:06 don't believe they ever explain the
26:07 shelves
26:08 and so he needs to wipe his butt
26:11 so he walks up to one of these things
26:13 and he says like 10 cuss words and it
26:14 keeps giving him this piece of paper
26:16 every time he says the customer and he
26:17 pulls it out and he goes that he uses to
26:19 wipe his ass
26:20 hilarious man brilliant writing but now
26:23 what if instead of this silly thing of
26:25 the dirty word mechanism
26:28 we get to a future that is reset by us
26:33 maybe when we get to that gene
26:34 roddenberry level of the world where
26:38 we got socialism to work we don't have
26:40 money anymore at
26:41 all just like star trek and you just
26:43 work because
26:45 you know society needs your skill set
26:47 and no job's too small
26:50 and no job's too big but what if in the
26:53 future
26:53 in some almost opposite of idiocracy
26:59 turning on a tv and listening to old
27:01 broadcasts from the past
27:03 because the ones in the future are very
27:05 optimized
27:06 but listening to stuff in the past is
27:08 considered
27:11 ill for your mind propaganda
27:15 and they just literally figured out what
27:17 marshall mcluhan was trying to say the
27:18 entire time this is bad information you
27:21 don't want this
27:21 in your head you will start to believe
27:23 like a heretic
27:26 now from our 2021 perspective if we were
27:29 seeing that future
27:31 policed in that way even though it is
27:34 still
27:34 thought police mechanisms
27:38 it's a seemingly a lack of
27:41 your rights to listen to whatever you
27:45 want to listen to
27:46 they have done the math on it they've
27:47 done maybe even artificial intelligence
27:49 analysis on this stuff
27:51 and they realize that no human being can
27:54 survive
27:55 listening to the information of the 21st
27:57 century in the 20th century
27:59 without changing in a way that is ill
28:02 for their
28:04 happiness in their own life and you
28:07 could write something in this movie
28:08 where it's like professors are taught to
28:10 control their minds and hear
28:12 things like vulcans right
28:15 well we practice in some temple to hear
28:18 suggestions of things that go to our
28:20 inner lusts of life not just
28:22 not just physical but mental
28:26 and then we deny ourselves like some
28:28 monk
28:30 until we could objectively view
28:33 information
28:34 but in this futuristic movie we might be
28:36 writing for such a thing we'd probably
28:38 just
28:38 have an ai listen to it and distill out
28:41 of it something so we don't expose
28:43 ourselves just like a robot that goes
28:44 into a
28:46 nuclear power plant to clean up some
28:47 mess
28:49 well tens of thousands of rads are
28:51 flying everywhere
28:53 there's a great meme going around where
28:55 someone in a mask
28:56 is talking to two amish farmers
29:00 and the bubble over the guy with the
29:02 mask is well why don't any one of you
29:04 have corona or covet or whatever
29:07 and the bubble over the amish guys say
29:09 well because we don't have a tv
29:12 and we know that's right point two of a
29:15 single percent
29:16 is your chance of death for eighty
29:19 percent of the
29:20 age bracket and we're freaking out we're
29:23 shutting down the economy and all this
29:25 other stuff what are we
29:26 crazy no wonder everyone's rebelling
29:28 around the world
29:30 doesn't mean they can't drop something
29:31 worse
29:33 but indeed they would have to to really
29:36 freak us all out
29:38 and there's a there's a
29:41 software hack out there who uh
29:44 really wants to do that ladder thing
29:47 we'll see what happens
29:48 i saw him make a video the other day his
29:51 name
29:52 uh may rhyme with someone like uh
29:56 jill bates but he he
29:59 actually released a video after using
30:01 maria abranovic for one of his
30:03 commercials for his company
30:04 the ultimate satan worshiper on planet
30:06 earth he used her
30:08 as the front person of his commercial
30:10 and they had to take it down so quickly
30:12 because everyone's like oh yeah
30:14 oh you're going to use a satanist to
30:16 promote your company
30:17 i don't think so but he's had to make a
30:21 video and
30:22 say all these conspiracies about me
30:25 creating it in the first place i mean
30:27 you know i hope this all just goes away
30:29 and it's just like dude you have killed
30:30 tons of people
30:32 tens of thousands of people with your
30:34 help
30:35 medical help sterilized hundreds of
30:38 thousands of people
30:40 with his stuff crazy
30:44 but controlling your mind
30:48 it's interesting isn't it what's
30:51 fascinating about it
30:52 is that it the the game is actually
30:54 incredibly simple
30:57 incredibly simple any information
31:01 you take into any of your senses
31:04 that evolves into an intellectual
31:06 concept in your mind a gestalt
31:08 in your head will
31:12 have an effect on your mind
31:16 now none of us want to live in a cage
31:17 man
31:19 and i think the the interesting thing is
31:22 is uh
31:24 there's two areas of the internet that i
31:25 have discovered
31:27 and at times been fascinated with myself
31:30 that i had the attitude this is a very
31:32 american attitude i don't know about any
31:34 other place in the world please
31:36 dear god those of you who comment from
31:39 other countries
31:40 just the most subtle comment from
31:41 another country based on anything i'm
31:43 talking about
31:45 is just gold bricks to me and i mean
31:46 that a hundred thousand percent
31:48 and that's a high percentage but the two
31:51 things that were really popular
31:53 and probably still are although i think
31:55 they're kind of dying down a little bit
31:56 in the united states
31:58 but for at least three to four decades
32:01 was pornographic material and
32:05 i guess you could say snuff material
32:08 where people get killed it's like
32:10 surveillance camera catches it
32:12 none of the stuff that is created by
32:15 these perverts right
32:18 but it's two areas of the world where
32:21 as a human being we were supposed to
32:23 avoid ever seeing
32:25 death in any catastrophic way live and
32:28 for the few folks that have actually
32:30 been involved in
32:31 in bad situations we pour our hearts out
32:34 and we hug them
32:35 with our minds and our bodies and we say
32:37 you know we're here for you
32:40 so sorry you had to see that you know
32:41 and let's let's make sure it doesn't
32:43 turn into ptsd let's
32:45 let's just be together and we'll just
32:47 shake you know as you're
32:48 vibrating this consciousness of trauma
32:52 in your heart
32:54 we'll be like havasu lake and we'll just
32:56 pull it out of you because we have a
32:57 lower frequency than you do about this
32:59 particular situation
33:01 and the more you get to talk about it
33:02 the more it seems like okay
33:04 it's all right it's like when you see a
33:07 a sad section of a movie
33:11 or a tv show and it just makes you choke
33:12 up and nearly cry or cry every single
33:15 time you see this one scene it just hits
33:17 your heart
33:18 for whatever reason well some of us will
33:21 watch
33:22 that scene 30 times to see if it will go
33:26 away if it just becomes a script
33:28 with some actors sometimes it goes away
33:31 after four or five watches and sometimes
33:33 you could watch it
33:35 30 times and you're still getting choked
33:37 up it's funny
33:38 i watched um
33:41 made a friend of mine watch mandalorian
33:44 all the way to the end
33:45 i won't read anything while i'm saying
33:47 this
33:48 but in case you don't know the end of
33:50 season two was very
33:52 emotional for a positive reason not a
33:54 negative reason
33:56 we got all the way to the end and i'm
33:58 watching her she's seeing this
34:00 and she's a star wars fan but not a star
34:03 wars buff
34:04 so a lot of the impact of what was going
34:06 on she was missing
34:08 and so we get done and i said okay now i
34:11 want you to watch a couple reaction
34:12 videos from super hardcore super
34:14 super or super star wars fans right
34:18 and she was totally into it and i put
34:20 him up it's probably a good 30 minute
34:22 one
34:23 and what's funny is as soon as these
34:26 people start crying
34:27 grown men man big old behemoth thor's
34:30 crying she starts crying
34:34 and it when it was all over she says my
34:36 god i cried way more watching other
34:37 people cry
34:38 than me watching it myself i said yeah
34:41 right
34:42 isn't that weird and sometimes it's just
34:45 a good
34:46 uh lethargic moment of exhausting
34:49 perhaps
34:50 other like-minded emotions that you have
34:52 pinned up so if you can cry for any
34:54 reason
34:55 you get it out of your system and i know
34:56 that sounds very sjw and believe me i
34:58 know that
34:59 businesses are now creating cry rooms
35:01 for people oh my god
35:04 i mean on one level and it's like okay
35:06 but like really you want to
35:07 institutionalize this in your business
35:10 where's your rebecca oh she's in the cry
35:12 room where's johnny he's in the cry room
35:14 with her oh jesus okay
35:16 i'm joking on part of that right
35:19 now the other one is this morbid
35:22 curiosity thing
35:24 of what what does a person look like
35:28 after certain crimes have occurred
35:33 it's kind of you know there's some
35:34 things you definitely don't want to see
35:36 because you'll never be able to take it
35:37 back i've seen way too many of those
35:40 but like i mentioned i'll just mention
35:42 real quickly i had a
35:44 parent of a i was 19 this guy was
35:47 probably in his 40s
35:49 and late 40s he bumped into a bad car
35:52 accident
35:53 and very quickly he saw something that
35:57 made him throw up and he became useless
36:00 as a
36:01 person that could help and he was one of
36:03 the first people on the scene so
36:05 later he was confiding in me that he
36:06 said you know
36:08 i felt so bad because i reacted poorly
36:11 to that and i wasn't of any help
36:14 and i thought oh my gosh well i should
36:16 you know for me i just was like okay i'm
36:18 gonna slowly
36:20 you know if i get the opportunity which
36:21 at the time there was no internet
36:23 http protocol out there
36:26 but eventually in the late 90s you know
36:28 i found a few websites that were showing
36:30 this kind of stuff or you know
36:31 photographs not any movies or anything
36:32 and i was like looking at these things
36:34 going okay all right all right whoa that
36:36 is really intense man
36:39 it got to the point where i felt like
36:40 okay i got it i got it you know
36:42 beyond this point if i can't handle it
36:45 then i just simply can't handle it
36:48 why mention these two things in the
36:50 middle of some mind controlling thing
36:52 is there an association well
36:55 it becomes a trendy fad of folks
37:00 to say you can't police me from seeing
37:03 something i want to see
37:07 and that's true and that's something we
37:08 obviously don't want to do but
37:10 okay the problem is is that we're not
37:14 talking about
37:15 people in their 40s 50s and above having
37:18 this issue
37:20 if you're still messed up at this age
37:22 well you know
37:24 you got some faculties to deal with it a
37:26 little bit better than when you were
37:27 younger
37:28 but when you're younger it's all about
37:29 defending your rite of passage
37:33 as a young person if you're exposed to
37:36 anything
37:37 negative and someone says it's trendy
37:40 says it's cool
37:42 you know i smoked a cigarette for the
37:44 first time and it went down like this
37:46 i had never put a cigarette in my mouth
37:48 in my life
37:50 i met my uh my new friends from oklahoma
37:55 we uh like i think i told you guys
37:57 within seconds i was in a fight with the
37:59 older kid
38:00 and we're wrestling around and fighting
38:03 and eventually put me in this like hold
38:05 like this
38:05 was a full nelson i never i've never
38:07 been in one before and so he locked me
38:09 up
38:10 no one's doing anything i'm just kind of
38:11 sitting there pinned so i gave up i was
38:14 like i tapped out and then it was good
38:15 and then he and i become immediate
38:17 friends
38:18 that day that day like we gain respect
38:20 for each other like a prison
38:22 beat down or something and the kid said
38:25 to me he goes uh
38:26 he's asking me questions and the thing
38:28 was he was cool when i was being a dick
38:29 that's really where it was at i'll take
38:31 full responsibility
38:33 the conversation evolved that night and
38:34 it was still early evening you know
38:36 still light outside summertime
38:38 sun wasn't set until about nine o'clock
38:41 and he goes well do you smoke cigarettes
38:44 not one to be
38:46 sensed as weak because i was nine years
38:48 old i said yeah
38:49 i never smoked a cigarette molly he goes
38:52 well do you inhale
38:54 i said yeah now i generally knew what
38:56 inhaling meant
38:58 my father had smoke but he didn't smoke
39:00 at this point in my life
39:02 he was just about to restart smoking
39:04 about a about a year later
39:07 he never smoked around me so i didn't
39:08 have ashtrays or cigarettes around my
39:10 grandparents smoked a little bit but
39:12 they stopped around that time too
39:15 so sure enough he pulls out some palm
39:17 all super long non-filters and some
39:19 lucky strike non-filters
39:21 this is here to it sure enough
39:24 i did it and for whatever reason i was
39:26 good at it right away which was crazy
39:29 i stopped two years later but see how
39:31 that worked
39:33 i got challenged my my ego was involved
39:37 my strength or weaknesses were being
39:39 measured by this
39:40 silly little moment as a kid
39:44 and so what did that do that did two
39:46 things but i want to make sure you
39:48 separate these two things in your head
39:49 because
39:50 you're you're going to be able to do
39:51 inventory in your mind
39:54 one it physically got me to smoke a
39:55 cigarette that was the
39:58 specific thing that happened but all no
40:00 not although not good
40:02 was not the biggest thing that was going
40:03 on there
40:05 i was an extremely strong-minded little
40:08 kid
40:09 but this was a big this was a big you
40:11 know moment between the two of us
40:13 but what i did was i conceded to peer
40:15 pressure
40:17 i let someone else tell me what was cool
40:22 which obviously wasn't cool
40:26 when you really come when it really
40:27 comes down to it was stupid
40:29 if i had continued to smoke who knows i
40:32 might even be alive today
40:34 i'd probably look way older and for
40:37 those of you don't know about cigars
40:39 we do not inhale these things and the
40:41 dudes who smoke these things
40:43 usually make it to 100 years old not
40:46 because of the stick
40:47 but just because uh maybe because the
40:49 stick actually they do say that you have
40:51 a
40:52 what was it a seven percent less chance
40:56 of catching cancer smoking cigars
40:57 because they they now believe
40:59 it was a study the cdc did released it
41:02 and then withdrawn it off the market was
41:04 a 15-year study
41:07 and i learned this from a very powerful
41:08 ceo
41:10 who doesn't really smoke that much but
41:11 he says yeah there's a seven percent
41:13 six to seven percent chance of uh or
41:15 less
41:16 chance on a hey you can say that
41:18 properly
41:20 catching cancer and they really thought
41:21 it had to do with mellowing you out
41:23 it's really strange but it makes your
41:24 breasts think so be careful
41:26 now i will say that in that era between
41:28 about 9 and 11
41:31 i probably fell into the peer pressure
41:34 thing
41:35 more than i should have unfortunately
41:38 for society i was already into being a
41:41 little bastard here and there
41:43 so i was thinking up new bad things to
41:46 do constantly which i'm so glad i
41:48 got that out of my system by at least
41:50 13.
41:52 let me give you the classic scenario a
41:54 classic question that all of us have
41:56 asked ourselves
41:57 depending how old you are dozens and
41:59 dozens of times which is what if you ran
42:02 the world
42:05 what if you ran the world and usually
42:06 comes in like
42:08 two different forms what if you ran the
42:11 world for a finite amount of time
42:13 a day a week a month a year a decade
42:17 and what if you ran the world for your
42:19 entire lifetime like some king
42:22 or some queen what would you do to get
42:25 the world to be more like the way you
42:27 want it to be
42:29 that usually reveals a tremendous amount
42:32 of your
42:34 self-perceived purpose in this world
42:37 what do you think is important what do
42:38 you think is not important
42:41 but immediately what's fascinating about
42:43 it is you tend to get to a point where
42:47 you're determining other people's lives
42:50 with that question well i would change
42:53 the laws to be a particular way
42:56 well that's huge now you're deciding
43:00 what people have access to and not have
43:02 access to
43:03 all right well so keep that in your mind
43:07 now let's look at this uh thought police
43:09 the censorship the shadow banning that's
43:11 going on right now it's crazy stuff
43:13 right
43:14 all right well you're in charge of the
43:16 world now what are you gonna do
43:19 what's fascinating about the whole
43:21 social media thing where everyone's
43:23 getting their
43:24 channels closed off and all this other
43:26 stuff
43:28 you're going to probably hate me a
43:29 little bit for this but let's think
43:31 about it this way
43:33 because part of me still understands
43:35 what's going on
43:39 you're a church of a particular kind
43:41 pick whatever religion you want
43:44 and you want a place where your church
43:46 goers your followers
43:48 your people who believe in your
43:49 philosophy can come and dialogue with
43:51 each other perhaps you're trying to make
43:52 sure that they have a place to date
43:54 each other and find each other to build
43:56 beautiful families
43:58 and then all of a sudden a bunch of
43:59 people come into your website
44:01 because you can do it and they sign up
44:04 they don't believe your religion at all
44:06 in fact all they do is sit and criticize
44:08 your religion constantly
44:11 do you think you should have the
44:13 corporate right to kick them off your
44:14 site
44:15 because they're definitely not following
44:16 your lead right they're not part of your
44:19 your clan i think every single person
44:22 would say yes
44:25 even though we know that maybe you could
44:28 come up with some software to quarantine
44:30 them away from
44:31 others but as long as anyone can request
44:34 somebody else it becomes an annoying
44:35 little process
44:38 what i think we find super annoying is
44:40 that we will create little
44:42 groups we lock them like the deep
44:45 thoughts radio
44:46 facebook page and we're minding our own
44:48 business we're all there because we are
44:50 like-minded
44:50 for the most part we've got some just
44:54 this is um february i guess technically
44:57 the 7th
44:58 it's really late at night it's about 2
45:00 30 in the morning
45:02 as of february 7th 2021 we've got some
45:04 amazing new members that are just
45:06 kicking it out of
45:07 the park man it's amazing we're going to
45:09 kick that instead of knocking out the
45:11 park
45:13 i'm sitting there thinking okay so hey
45:15 facebook we're just doing our own little
45:17 thing
45:18 and they're still going in there and
45:20 saying that whatever's true is not true
45:22 it's it's hideous i have to deal with
45:24 this crap all day long
45:26 your posts are getting removed and
45:28 you've posted something
45:29 brilliant you've posted something very
45:32 truthful
45:33 and they just don't want you to have
45:35 that that is where i think they've
45:37 crossed the line
45:39 i think pretending to give you an
45:42 opportunity to talk
45:44 and then secretly deviously and
45:46 seditiously
45:48 getting behind the scenes and shadow
45:49 banning you destroying your
45:52 your view counts like they do on our
45:53 channel like crazy i mean we have been
45:55 robbed
45:56 i don't even know it's not millions but
45:58 definitely
45:59 hundreds of thousands of views aren't
46:02 being
46:02 recorded on our channel on youtube
46:05 guarantee
46:07 i went back and reviewed a bunch of
46:08 metrics uh two days ago
46:11 i got episodes that have definitely been
46:13 watched nearly a hundred thousand times
46:15 and it hasn't moved up on iota
46:17 since they were released it's just
46:19 hilarious
46:20 but every month i get a metric on it
46:23 right you guys heard me say that
46:26 but you're king you're queen you're
46:28 running the show
46:31 what would you allow in and what
46:32 wouldn't you allow in what would you do
46:34 in your personal circle of influence in
46:36 terms of
46:36 being influenced by others and then what
46:38 would you want for your people
46:40 or do you feel like you should protect
46:43 them
46:45 my little answer
46:49 is well if you don't protect them
46:54 and again we haven't uh you're a king
46:56 and a queen at a point where
46:58 even though you're in charge of the
46:59 world unless you put down a decree to
47:02 find
47:02 all of the evil people in the world you
47:04 have a method to do it and you've got a
47:06 army to do it what if you still can't
47:09 get rid of all the people that
47:11 used to run the world or hate the fact
47:13 that you do run the world they don't
47:14 even really think about it right it's
47:16 the king's burden right
47:18 so you know if you open up communication
47:20 to a free market free speech world
47:22 these people are going to get in there
47:23 and brainwash your little kids
47:26 they're going to try to use free speech
47:28 against you to put television shows on
47:30 with little girls dressed like jean
47:32 benny ramsey
47:34 trying to look as sexy as possible on a
47:36 stage
47:38 it's already happened this century
47:40 netflix cuties
47:44 unbelievable okay so now we have to kind
47:47 of filter this thing of like okay
47:49 we got the free speech first amendment
47:52 but the same time we know there's things
47:54 we don't want our little girls to hear
47:56 and we have little things things that we
47:58 want a little boys to hear because it
47:59 can totally change who they are as a
48:02 being
48:04 but now let's come back to grown-up land
48:06 for a split second
48:08 and just think about a trajectory a
48:11 vector
48:12 we're talking about our mission to mars
48:16 58 million miles away was one of the
48:19 shortest distances
48:20 i could find in the log charts from nasa
48:23 for sending a probe to mars
48:26 again mars is going 20 000 miles faster
48:28 than the vehicle
48:30 so for various reasons we don't believe
48:32 those are actually succeeding
48:34 but that's a whole different episode
48:35 which you can go see just a few videos
48:37 back
48:39 but again if you're off one millionth of
48:41 a degree
48:42 headed towards a planet that's moving
48:45 again like 50 to 60 000 miles an hour
48:48 through space
48:49 in a gigantic orbit
48:53 and you're off a millionth of a degree
48:55 and you're going to travel 58 million
48:57 miles
48:58 well now a millionth of a degree means
49:00 something because you're traveling so
49:02 far
49:04 you may not hit your target if you have
49:07 any
49:08 imperfections in your trajectory okay
49:12 take that to you go back to when you
49:14 were a kid
49:15 and you started to ingest media
49:18 television
49:19 especially movies especially
49:22 music especially your other relatives
49:25 and friends around you
49:27 friends that don't have your parents as
49:29 their parents so they
49:30 could have been unsupervised how was it
49:33 that i hung out with a ton of kids
49:35 before nine years old and none of them
49:36 smoked and these two kids
49:37 i met were smoking
49:41 how's that possible
49:44 well their father was about 60 years old
49:46 even though these kids were 10 and 12
49:50 and their mother was probably at least
49:53 in her late 40s they had these kids
49:54 really late
49:56 she's a huge evangelical
50:00 super duper religious person she looked
50:02 like the lady from poltergeist who
50:04 cleared the house
50:05 but bigger taller that she would belt
50:09 these kids and make them read the bible
50:10 and all this crazy so at home
50:12 it was like this draconian strange
50:15 almost like catholic school dad was
50:18 just really tired man he was a
50:21 hard-working dude i'm sure
50:24 so there's supervision at home was
50:27 minimal
50:27 or extreme and it never made any sense
50:31 right
50:32 it was like if they got caught smoking
50:34 which i mean our breath must have been
50:36 atrocious coming home because we
50:37 wouldn't just smoke one or two we'd
50:40 smoke half a pack together
50:41 all day long
50:45 instead of saying hey kids don't don't
50:46 smoke because it could kill you because
50:48 both of them did
50:49 they couldn't they couldn't virtue
50:50 signal health benefits or health risks
50:54 she just made them read the bible and
50:57 built them
50:58 the big leather belt she was the
51:01 disciplinary
51:02 so say i had not had the wherewithal at
51:05 10
51:06 to crush the pack of winston's i had
51:08 when i found out i was short of breath
51:10 i found out that i was getting short of
51:12 breath at 10 years old running around
51:15 and i had heard the rumor that that's
51:16 what cigarettes can do to you and so i
51:18 took that pack on a hot summer day
51:20 put it on the sidewalk and i crushed it
51:21 which was pure gold man
51:23 brand new pack of cigarettes oh my god
51:27 and i swore them off and i never went
51:28 back except for
51:30 one time at 12 and one time at 15. that
51:32 was it
51:33 i think i smoked anything but a little
51:35 bit of weed in my late 20s
51:37 until i picked up a cigar in 2009
51:41 even then i took five years off from
51:42 that until my buddy kyle
51:44 for mk ultra he used to bring sticks
51:46 over we used to smoke while we were
51:48 watching the show or
51:49 sorry recording the show i guess we were
51:51 watching it too
51:52 so all these trajectories you know i got
51:55 exposed to
51:57 porn nine years old because my parents
52:00 left the tape out
52:02 yeah i got all my like cartoons and
52:03 stuff i like to watch and also i put
52:05 this video in i'm like what are they
52:06 doing
52:06 i couldn't even figure out what the hell
52:08 they were doing with their bodies
52:10 that installed a big curiosity for me
52:12 and then it's like okay i didn't get a
52:13 chance to see any more for a few years
52:15 and then it was like
52:16 watching this stuff still didn't make
52:19 any sense like does that feel good i've
52:20 never done that you know
52:22 i shouldn't have been exposed to that it
52:24 oversexed me as a kid
52:28 it could have gone super bad could have
52:31 gone super duper bad thankfully i had a
52:33 brain that
52:34 kept it inside some context i had prints
52:37 kind of making it more
52:38 hey you got to get consent and you know
52:40 this is the way you keep it cool
52:42 but man what if i turned into some nut
52:44 bag who was like
52:45 gotta have it gonna take it and i turned
52:48 in some date rape freak
52:50 could happen if nothing else i could
52:53 have been a guy that just authors a
52:55 bunch of kids inside women
52:56 but i don't care i don't care about you
52:58 know them dealing with it i just keep
53:00 moving on to the next girl
53:02 four or five girls pregnant before i'm
53:03 25.
53:06 because of my influences in other areas
53:08 for things that i picked i picked some
53:09 good people
53:11 to influence me but man it could have
53:14 gone bad
53:15 but now let's think about for a split
53:17 second
53:19 our habits our habits versus our
53:24 probably deep internal desires
53:27 so you're hearing all the stuff in 2020
53:29 i'm gonna
53:30 suggest that every single one of you can
53:32 hear my voice
53:34 is awake you're red pilled
53:37 some of you'll go back five years some
53:38 go back 10 20 30 40 50 years
53:42 and some people have been awake for a
53:43 really long time and i
53:45 absolutely am blessed with your audience
53:48 let me tell you
53:49 let me tell you i feel super duper
53:52 privileged anytime i see a view on a
53:53 video
53:54 believe me i mean that from the core of
53:57 my heart
53:59 but you do some things still today
54:02 because there are habits their habits
54:05 from your past you've gained a
54:06 perspective of what's good about them
54:08 what's bad about them
54:10 but you still do it now sometimes you
54:13 can gain a different pair of eyeballs
54:16 and it really helps you digest what
54:18 you're seeing
54:19 right now for those of you who are
54:22 friends with me and my black and white
54:24 facebook account which is what i used to
54:26 post on facebook
54:28 you're all welcome to join me there i
54:31 posted two cigars the other day
54:33 it's a tuesday i posted two cigars
54:37 within one night
54:38 and one of our buddies was like uh
54:42 dude are you are you chain smoking like
54:44 what's going on
54:46 and i assume this person doesn't smoke
54:47 sticks which is totally cool
54:50 but you do this thing we call it a herf
54:53 and it's where guys get together
54:55 and you know you're going to smoke at
54:56 least two sticks usually that's kind of
54:58 the minimum
55:00 sometimes professional herps where you
55:02 go and pay like 600 bucks
55:04 you go to an early fancy dinner there's
55:05 usually some celebrities there
55:07 something like it's usually always the
55:09 actors that have played bambinos on
55:12 movies or television shows it's just
55:14 weird how that's the case
55:16 but they'll sit and smoke with you
55:17 sometimes a real famous cigar company
55:19 owners
55:20 i've never been to one of those but my
55:23 buddies to go
55:24 and have been say you'll smoke
55:27 five to ten sticks in that day so just
55:29 so you have a perspective there
55:31 but this uh thing i'm doing on tuesday
55:33 nights apparently right now
55:36 is we're watching taxi it's a buddy of
55:38 mine we pick a show we try to find some
55:40 really good show that appeals to us as
55:42 adults
55:43 again we did mass cheers frasier and
55:45 then arrested development and then we
55:47 are now doing taxi i'm watching this
55:50 with new eyeballs
55:51 when i'm watching it because you know
55:53 when it was out i was
55:56 i was eight through uh
56:00 13 or so i did not see all the episodes
56:04 for sure the writing in this show is
56:05 beyond amazing but i can see agendas
56:09 going on
56:10 in the shows i can see why they got
56:13 greenlit in the first place because
56:15 there was an
56:15 undertow thing it's almost like they
56:18 learned
56:19 what rod sterling was doing with
56:20 twilight zone which is to hide messages
56:22 inside the writing and to control your
56:27 your dopamine while you're seeing
56:29 certain events occur
56:31 they'll make something that's
56:32 destructive in your life feel very
56:34 positive
56:36 now luckily
56:41 taxi is holding up really really well so
56:43 far i don't really see any super
56:45 negative
56:47 things going on there's a lot of single
56:48 people in the show in fact everyone in
56:50 the show
56:51 is not married has one of he's been
56:54 married with a couple kids
56:56 one of them is divorced and they you
56:59 know the if anything the only subtle
57:00 message is see you can survive a divorce
57:03 so if you need to get out of a bad
57:04 situation you can survive both as a
57:06 woman and as a man
57:09 so maybe that message isn't the worst
57:11 thing in the world
57:13 and i think that as well divorce
57:16 in the 70s for instance was more
57:18 prevalent for
57:19 a different reason than it is today
57:21 today it is anticipated
57:23 because society says well if it doesn't
57:25 work out just get the word no big deal
57:26 if you're a guy be very careful sign a
57:28 prenup blah blah blah blah blah don't
57:30 have any kids until you're really sure
57:31 this is a good thing
57:33 but back in the 70s the inner
57:35 communication between a couple
57:37 was really bad i mean you would argue
57:40 and nothing else you would never sit
57:42 down and try to work anything out
57:44 you go back one more generation to my
57:46 grandparents and they simply
57:48 stuck together no matter what and
57:51 arguments were much rarer
57:54 if you got upset you just ate it as a
57:57 man as a woman you just ate it
57:59 which makes you kind of stoic and
58:01 strange you know
58:03 so now we have all of the tools to deal
58:06 with
58:07 both finding a good mate i think we've
58:10 all sort of figured out that some of
58:11 those again those incidental things
58:14 you know when you're trying to figure
58:15 out with your whether or not you're
58:16 compatible with somebody else
58:18 unless you're a child still as an adult
58:20 you're not trying to say well i'd like
58:22 i like this team and they like this team
58:24 i like this music and they like this
58:26 music
58:26 it doesn't hurt okay but the bigger
58:29 brand of macaroni underneath
58:30 is what is their purpose what is your
58:32 purpose if they don't know themselves
58:34 that well and you don't know yourself
58:35 that well
58:36 then maybe uh hold off until you do
58:40 and you can resolve that in a night you
58:42 can just sit down and think about it
58:44 well yeah we are yeah we do want the
58:46 same thing
58:47 but by the way one of the trickiest
58:50 easiest
58:50 ways to find that out is to do that
58:52 simulation between the two of you and
58:54 say
58:54 you know what if you ran the world what
58:55 would you do and then
58:57 boom you find out what they're made out
58:59 of
59:01 are they interested in other people
59:04 being well gotten a little wind here
59:09 it's all foggy it's crazy i don't think
59:11 you can quite see it
59:13 it's not that cold out but here's what
59:17 i've noticed with taxi
59:18 this is important and this is related to
59:20 this show i'm not just trying to go off
59:21 on my little
59:22 whim here obviously 2021 comes with a
59:28 layer cake of 5d chests whether or not
59:30 anyone else is playing it you're playing
59:32 it and i'm playing it
59:33 trying to deal with all the issues that
59:36 are going on
59:37 i'll let you fill in the blank
59:40 for me as an american putting on taxi as
59:43 a show
59:44 which i believe uh we ripped them all
59:46 down but i think it's on hulu
59:50 maybe it's on prime too i don't know i
59:52 think it's on prime
59:53 amazon prime i hate to say i'm spending
59:55 money there i use another person's
59:56 account
59:58 i feel so reborn
60:03 as a classic american watching this show
60:07 and it's because of the way that the
60:08 human beings treat each other in the
60:10 show man
60:12 if you want to know what america was
60:14 like back in the day
60:15 as much as this is a kitschy kind of
60:18 comedy
60:19 that was on tv and obviously there's
60:21 characters like lodka
60:23 played by andy kaufman which is a
60:24 complete fabrication
60:26 but there were people kind of like that
60:27 in real life but you know you have to be
60:29 in a big city to really find a person
60:30 that kind of
60:32 dialed out of reality but all the other
60:35 characters really care about each other
60:36 as human beings
60:38 danny devito plays louis de palma
60:42 who's in a he's an amazing actor if you
60:44 want to see him
60:45 just just do an amazing bizarre
60:48 character
60:49 he is the the hater he's the jealous one
60:54 by the way i just found out he actually
60:56 had his wife
60:58 on the show and that's where they met
61:00 and that's where they're married had
61:01 been married ever since
61:03 it was pretty cool 1980 he meets his
61:04 wife on taxi
61:07 but it's this feeling i get after
61:08 watching the show and we'll do about six
61:10 episodes or so
61:12 about three hours and you just feel
61:14 amazing
61:15 you feel like oh my god there's the old
61:17 america that used to exist
61:19 of course if you go back more decades
61:21 you'll find tons of those shows
61:23 but it's interesting to see this one in
61:25 color it's interesting to see this one
61:27 dealing with real world issues that we
61:28 still would deal with today
61:31 you don't feel like you're being mind
61:32 controlled other than
61:34 a nostalgic um tour through good
61:39 you know for the most part good american
61:42 slash good human behavior and i'm sure
61:46 that
61:46 every one of your countries has your own
61:48 version of the show i watch tons of
61:49 british stuff like
61:51 are you being served another show where
61:54 there's a lot of antagonistic kind of
61:56 themes but it's still hilarious it's
61:58 still amazing
61:59 no agendas really my god they have an
62:02 episode with blackface as a finale
62:04 and they still air it i mean
62:08 but again they're not mean-spirited
62:10 about it so
62:12 it's okay
62:15 but now we have this cancer or cancer i
62:17 mean i always say that
62:19 cancel culture really is cancer culture
62:22 isn't it
62:23 i did an episode on it care to watch
62:25 that
62:26 but it's a hot topic isn't it a bunch of
62:29 these famous
62:30 celebrities who've been comedians and
62:32 actors
62:33 hate it because they're like you could
62:35 never make blazing saddles today
62:38 but what's funny about blazing saddles
62:39 by mel brooks is that a bunch of
62:43 black folks have watched the video or
62:46 watched the movie and reacted to
62:48 it on youtube and they said this is the
62:50 funniest thing on planet earth
62:52 we need more like this not necessarily
62:55 just for the racism that was in there
62:57 which is what they were making fun of
62:58 the entire episode
63:00 the arrow was the black sheriff and that
63:03 was written by all the
63:04 the white jewish writers and then
63:07 richard pryor writes all the racist
63:09 white lines
63:12 and that's why it was gold and in the
63:14 end
63:15 you should have expunged all of your
63:18 racism
63:19 and you should have realized you were
63:20 dumb if you were one
63:22 a racist person and the people that were
63:25 racist
63:25 in the movie lost can't make that today
63:29 because of some little technicality
63:31 oh i was offended you know but the last
63:34 archetype i'm going to talk about in
63:36 this particular episode
63:37 is that archetype of
63:40 someone leveraging their snowflakey
63:45 really one dimensional low vibration low
63:48 iq
63:49 analysis of a situation never once
63:53 being able to as we said earlier in the
63:55 episode to step outside themselves
63:57 and see the society as a as a society as
64:01 as opposed to a an individual talking to
64:04 an individual
64:06 i have a close friend of mine who has
64:07 three daughters and
64:09 all three kids are at different levels
64:11 of
64:13 obviously maturity but definitely within
64:15 the different snow flakiness
64:17 of their lifestyle what's interesting is
64:20 the oldest one
64:22 who i think is in her early 30s by now
64:24 she is dealing with
64:25 a massive sjw platform thing
64:29 she will chastise her parents if they
64:32 slip and say a pronoun
64:34 in text messages to each other
64:38 the middle child is becoming a man
64:42 and she seems honestly to be pretty cool
64:44 with the fact that she understands that
64:47 or he understands that people are still
64:49 going to refer to
64:51 him as her especially her mother
64:54 but apparently a text went back and
64:55 forth where the mother said
64:57 you know happy birthday and said her
64:59 original name
65:01 which has now changed the girl that
65:03 received it who's becoming a man
65:06 for now at least didn't flinch was like
65:09 thanks mom
65:12 the older daughter comes in to virtue
65:14 and save the day
65:15 no one wants her to save the day but
65:18 she's got to insert herself
65:20 to get some to extort emotion out of her
65:23 mother
65:24 which is you owe me an apology for
65:26 having to read that about my
65:29 brother now and my brother
65:32 has also been offended so you go over
65:34 there and apologize to him
65:37 when the now brother wasn't offended at
65:40 all
65:41 by the way it's crazy because that
65:42 brother has a kid who's trying to figure
65:45 out are you my mom or my dad
65:47 and then if you are my dad what the hell
65:49 is my father
65:52 apparently the father is also sort of bi
65:54 so it's just
65:55 wow things happen the younger kid is
65:58 totally conservative now
66:01 and just thinks this whole thing's crazy
66:06 but now let's rewind that situation
66:10 there are a lot of us that believe that
66:11 without media
66:14 the brother would still be a mother or a
66:16 sister i should say
66:17 the father would still be a mother there
66:20 wouldn't be any problems
66:22 society is creating totally hybrid
66:26 bizarre
66:27 situations for people to deal with and
66:30 what's interesting about it is if we're
66:32 totally sensitive to these individuals
66:34 we have to say okay we know
66:37 kids for whatever reason can identify
66:41 the other way
66:42 to the opposite gender very early i know
66:46 a kid that was
66:47 by the age of seven i don't know what
66:49 happened i mean i actually do know what
66:50 happened he got molested by his uncle
66:52 and had a really hard hard childhood at
66:55 his home
66:57 i don't know if that affected him don't
67:00 know
67:02 it wouldn't be arrogant enough to say
67:04 but we have a member of my family that
67:06 again he was a boy he was raised like a
67:07 girl he was 12 because his mother was
67:09 nuts
67:10 guess what he doesn't like the opposite
67:13 sex
67:15 he feels like the opposite sex
67:19 that's tough that's tough to see someone
67:22 socially conditioned a child
67:24 to be that way and now he is that way
67:27 now does he love himself
67:29 i don't know i don't know has he
67:31 obviously had a harder path in life
67:33 because of that choice
67:34 yeah because he's in his 70s and he was
67:37 dealing with a bunch he was dealing from
67:39 he was dealing with being from a very
67:40 conservative area in the midwest
67:42 he moved out here to california dealt
67:45 with all the
67:47 push back here and then i think he's now
67:49 back in the midwest i think
67:51 he was out here it was actually a few
67:53 miles from within 30 miles of where i am
67:56 i haven't physically seen him in years
67:59 but this leverage
68:00 that people try to insert on you
68:03 as soon as someone again when i was a
68:05 kid let me just rewind on that sentence
68:08 when i was a kid you did not hear
68:10 someone say
68:11 i'm offended even one thousandth of what
68:15 you hear it today
68:18 i don't know what it was i think that
68:20 obviously someone could say something
68:22 that would
68:23 bother you and again i have a episode on
68:26 being offended i call it a bogus emotion
68:28 which you're really
68:29 feeling is anger that's what you're
68:31 really feeling
68:32 you're pissed off that someone said
68:34 something to you and awaited and just
68:36 pissed you off offended okay
68:40 maybe that's the sum total output at the
68:42 end you want to use that it's okay to
68:44 use it i use it every once in a while
68:47 but today it is all about being offended
68:50 because it is a way to extort emotion of
68:53 other people
68:53 which basically means you're living your
68:55 life you're moving in a linear line
68:56 you're dealing with all the obstacles
68:58 that everyone else is dealing with
69:00 and today it couldn't be any worse it
69:02 can't be any worse than today
69:04 i mean in the modern world of the 21st
69:06 century
69:08 obviously you've had much worse times in
69:10 the past
69:12 but now these people want you to stop on
69:14 a dime
69:16 stop on a dime and deal with their issue
69:20 to figure out words to satiate them a
69:23 lot of folks
69:24 even without any type of super social
69:28 mental re-engineering
69:30 like i said in my episode about being
69:32 offended you have couples
69:34 that learn that if they can express
69:36 being offended to their partner
69:38 there's some reward because on one
69:40 particular night
69:42 this is portrayed in television all the
69:43 time this is where this
69:45 comes let's say uh the most common
69:48 archetype i've seen in writing is the
69:51 male
69:52 being sort of the the dumb guy right men
69:55 dumb
69:55 girl smart that's usually the theme
69:57 these days
69:59 man does something wrong girls offended
70:02 guy does like uh well
70:06 wasn't it kobe they bought his wife a
70:07 big giant diamond ring
70:10 right after he was accused of sleeping
70:12 with this uh maid at a
70:14 hotel or something but you give your
70:16 wife a back massage you take her out to
70:18 dinner you do something to repair
70:20 the damage that you did now most omega
70:24 females will appreciate that gesture and
70:27 and not be super sensitive anyway if you
70:29 piss off an omega female
70:32 it's it's something you really did wrong
70:34 let me tell you man
70:36 the alpha female is constantly
70:38 constantly
70:39 living in that state of mind but now it
70:42 becomes a
70:44 a one-two punch i tell you i'm offended
70:48 then i get the first kind of
70:51 serendipitous paybacks out of you
70:53 and then i start
70:57 inserting myself to tell you what i want
71:00 you to do in order to fix it
71:02 it's like a sort of a home shopping
71:04 network all in your own house
71:06 i want a back massage okay so what i'm
71:08 gonna do is
71:10 when he comes home tonight i'm going to
71:11 say he did this one thing wrong
71:13 and that uh you know back massage would
71:15 really make it better
71:16 or i want to go to dinner or i want a
71:18 new dress i want this i want that
71:20 guys do it too guys do it too
71:25 it's despicable behavior between human
71:27 beings
71:29 but now that little tiny archetype
71:31 between individuals is
71:32 manifested up to companies groups
71:36 countries a country against another
71:38 country
71:40 the difficult one that i will mention is
71:43 it's difficult it's really difficult we
71:45 have these situations in history where
71:48 one history is sometimes recorded
71:50 correctly and
71:51 and correctly i should say
71:54 records the massacre that might have
71:57 occurred
71:58 like the massacre of dan king the native
72:00 americans being slaughtered in this
72:02 country
72:04 so some really bad stuff
72:07 and even if you don't get every single
72:08 corner nook and cranny of what happened
72:10 wrong
72:11 you got enough the blacks that were
72:14 forced to be slaves
72:16 that kind of thing but the the real rub
72:20 is
72:21 sometimes those things happen so long
72:23 ago
72:24 that the initial instinct of those who
72:28 did it
72:29 is they had a rationale to do it so they
72:31 don't feel like they owe anyone any
72:32 any apologies and then all the people
72:36 that suffered from that situation
72:38 passed through natural causes or what
72:40 have you and those that did it
72:42 also pass because it's been 100 years
72:45 since the event occurred
72:47 or long enough that everybody
72:48 participated is long gone
72:50 now you have all the survivors of the
72:53 situation
72:54 trying to deal with the situation
72:58 it makes no sense at this point with dan
73:01 king
73:01 china just wanted japan to admit they
73:03 did it it's all on video man
73:05 if and what's funny slash i mean not
73:08 really funny but
73:08 interesting and pathetic is that
73:11 americans are never taught about that
73:12 event
73:14 and it's horrific my friends taiwanese
73:17 which means he is a
73:19 sort of chinese bloodline but he's in
73:20 taiwan he's here now
73:23 he said to me one night he goes oh you
73:24 haven't he's like it's like the master
73:26 of nan king
73:27 i said what the massacre of what he goes
73:29 you never heard of that
73:30 i'm like no what is that and you says
73:32 let me just show you puts on a one hour
73:33 documentary my job was on the ground man
73:37 wow and in ways it is worse than
73:40 anything you ever saw from the
73:42 concentration camps in terms of video
73:44 and
73:46 pictures and things that occurred at
73:47 that
73:49 time it was just awful awful awful
73:52 so today in this time frame they've
73:54 wanted japan to just apologize and admit
73:57 they did it
73:58 and i think they did i think they did
74:00 but it was sort of one of these kind of
74:02 kind of apologies you know it's rough
74:06 no one in japan feels like doing that
74:08 ever again
74:10 after world war ii like murakami said
74:12 japan turned into a cute country
74:14 literally cartoons and and fun things
74:17 look at tokyo man it's like a video game
74:19 you're living inside of it's like you
74:20 went into tron if you're in tokyo
74:22 it's crazy they're not that way anymore
74:28 now could circumstances change sure sure
74:31 we'll deal with that if that happens
74:33 slavery in america is really rough
74:36 99 of every american has never
74:39 in their family line ever owned anybody
74:43 at least in the modern 400 years that
74:45 they've been here my family's been here
74:47 for
74:49 in 10 years my family will have been
74:50 here 400 years
74:53 well they were slaves on a plantation
74:55 when they got here the two families that
74:56 got here in the 1630s
74:59 okay they had to fight their way out and
75:01 run in the middle of the night
75:02 california is trying to
75:05 talk about hailing reparations well
75:08 california wasn't even a state until
75:09 1850.
75:12 slavery is abolished 16 years later or
75:16 so
75:18 technically 20. but uh then a bunch of
75:21 other bad stuff it was all in the south
75:22 that was not here
75:24 so this state considering such a thing
75:26 is sort of funny it's sort of ludicrous
75:28 it's like come on
75:30 and they try to say okay well you
75:31 benefited from this being the race that
75:33 you were
75:36 what's interesting about it is that all
75:39 my friends who
75:40 could assert such a thing don't they're
75:43 like that has nothing to do with me now
75:45 but this gets into your mind doesn't it
75:50 if you're a white person in america for
75:52 instance
75:53 or anywhere on this continent i should
75:55 say you have to sit and contemplate that
75:57 it stops you in your tracks and you have
75:59 to kind of go
76:00 was this something i need to acknowledge
76:02 i mean i do acknowledge that it happened
76:04 in a
76:04 horrible situation but is it really to
76:06 me did my
76:08 my family benefit from such a thing i
76:11 don't know
76:11 what were the benefits of say slavery
76:13 for instance it made a bunch of
76:14 europeans in the south
76:16 on their plantations extremely rich and
76:19 some forefathers who were super ballers
76:21 got to own a few it's a touchy situation
76:25 man
76:26 but me just doing this episode not
76:28 expressing the proper amount of
76:30 empathy for the situation or perspective
76:32 or even having the correct history
76:34 in a particular area could trigger
76:36 somebody
76:38 those of you who know me would know i
76:40 would never do that if i had the power
76:42 not to do it
76:44 doesn't matter to some though they want
76:47 to stop me in my tracks
76:49 they want me to give them what i have
76:53 controlling your mind it is a
76:58 it is a tough slash tall order
77:02 even if the world was peachy keen
77:05 you know let's say that we had never had
77:07 any massacres never had any wars
77:09 never had any slavery ever ever ever
77:13 and so you're living a great life
77:14 everyone's sort of on an equal level
77:17 well you're dealing with your own demons
77:19 aren't you
77:20 you're happy as a clam but you get tired
77:23 before you want to get tired
77:25 you get sick before you want to get sick
77:29 before you expect to get sick so people
77:31 age a lot faster than other people
77:34 because they're all stressed out so this
77:36 all inhibits your
77:37 your mechanical ability to control your
77:40 mind
77:41 but isn't that one of the most sovereign
77:43 things you deserve is to be able to
77:44 control your mind
77:46 if you wonder why i make these more
77:48 esoteric episodes is because
77:51 it is a very tall order and it comes at
77:54 us from so many different angles
77:57 that i feel like you have to hear it
77:59 from as many angles as you can
78:01 and you know what this episode may have
78:03 been very beneficial for some people
78:06 that went yeah never even thought about
78:07 it like that and others you've heard
78:08 other episodes and you
78:10 you have your own mind and you're
78:12 deducing this ahead of me
78:13 it's like oh yeah he's talking about
78:15 what i figured out 20 years ago or
78:16 whatever
78:18 and then i expect you to put comments in
78:19 the comments section to
78:21 offer better solutions for some of this
78:23 stuff what you did to get past this kind
78:26 of stuff
78:26 perspectives that you had epiphanies
78:29 that you had that went oh yeah you know
78:31 what it's
78:32 when i figured out it was like this i
78:34 didn't think about it anymore it was
78:36 okay
78:38 like i said probably in like the gosh
78:41 third to fifth episode somewhere in
78:43 there i said look man
78:44 one of the big catalysts for making this
78:46 show was that nobody gets a manual for
78:48 life
78:50 do we you know like in betelgeuse when
78:52 they
78:53 the two found out alec baldwin and um
78:56 davis they found out they were on the
78:58 other side they came home and they found
78:59 the book of the deceased
79:02 and it told them how to live in the
79:04 afterlife told them where to go to
79:07 put a petition in to change something
79:10 we don't get that in this world do we
79:13 and it's
79:13 the funny i should say the backhanded
79:17 joke about that book for me was always
79:21 the funny nature of you get it after you
79:24 die
79:25 i mean when you need it you don't have
79:26 it but after you don't need it anymore
79:28 because you're not
79:29 fearing death anymore because you're
79:30 already dead and you're in the spiritual
79:32 your body's died and you're in the
79:33 spiritual form
79:35 you know you suddenly get the manual
79:37 interesting right
79:40 i will say to you in closing that this
79:42 is something that little towns
79:44 i think benefit from more on a natural
79:48 basis they have deep thoughts
79:50 all over the place no matter how maybe
79:52 shallow people are or whatever
79:54 the wisdom of life is everywhere
79:57 constantly
79:58 there's always an old woman or an old
79:59 man that you know
80:01 and even if you're not talking to them
80:03 and drilling it out of them they're
80:04 discussing in any way with someone else
80:05 around you
80:07 maybe it's even your relative and so you
80:10 grow up more sophisticated on the in the
80:12 end
80:12 it takes a little while you do need to
80:14 have an inquisitive mind
80:17 in the big city with millions of people
80:19 around you you have less friends
80:22 you may have all your family i don't
80:26 and so you know a lot of time to think
80:27 about things
80:29 i pontificate so anyway let me know what
80:32 you think
80:34 i came out here not knowing what i was
80:35 going to record i hadn't uh
80:37 i was going to do a whole episode on the
80:38 ego thing but i mentioned at the
80:40 beginning episode and realized it's not
80:42 quite
80:42 enough but then i drilled down to its
80:44 root meaning
80:45 which is the name of the show if you
80:48 haven't been to deep thoughts radio
80:49 please go
80:50 deepthoughtsradio.com i should say it's
80:52 got everything up there video audio

80:56 one a store and a couple ways to donate
80:58 to the show
80:59 for all those who do part with a penny
81:01 here and there
81:02 thank you so so much on patreon
81:05 some of you come in on paypal
81:09 and when you do that it's just wonderful
81:10 because you pretty much cover
81:13 a year's worth of contributions all in
81:15 one pop so i super duper appreciate you
81:17 as well
81:18 i do want to re-solicit to you guys
81:21 ideas for episodes
81:23 the key here is that if you have a super
81:24 deep subject
81:26 and a four-hour video you want to give
81:27 me in the description or the link
81:29 or the comments below i should say
81:31 please give me a little bit of a
81:33 sort of a summation of what a particular
81:36 individual might be about so if you give
81:38 me a name you're like i'd really like
81:39 you to do an episode on this person hit
81:42 colon and type this woman or this man is
81:45 really into this
81:46 and i think they're one of the best
81:47 authorities in this and maybe you should
81:49 check another person after you check
81:51 this first person out
81:53 and believe me you'll put a hook in my
81:56 cheek
81:56 and you'll get me over there when it
81:58 comes in and i click a video and it's
82:00 really really long i just kind of look
82:01 at my scales we're going oh my god how
82:03 am i going to pull this off
82:04 i'm making another lay video because
82:05 i've been writing all day
82:07 but i'll do some more during the day i
