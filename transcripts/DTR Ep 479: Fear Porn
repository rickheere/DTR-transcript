00:29 alright ladies and gentlemen welcome
00:31 back to deep thoughts before we get
00:33 started so I want to show you this new
00:35 t-shirt I got here which is uh it's
00:40 pretty badass man you know lots of
00:42 comment on it today so these are
00:45 straight out of the store this one's the
00:47 sports model version so it only has this
00:49 on the top it's actually a hoodie
00:50 underneath I forgot the other shirt
00:52 which you can't Lisi cuz I decided to
00:55 get it in grey it actually looks good in
00:56 person but on the camera was a little
00:58 strange the island certs and vanity pics
01:02 in there as I start this big-ass black
01:08 market I got this cigar at one of my
01:12 local joints that a guy used to own the
01:16 place
01:17 and I befriended him and he had great
01:20 prices on sticks he had some that were a
01:22 little too expensive in my opinion I
01:24 know what he got him for this one was
01:28 like all random it was like some steaks
01:30 that cost a lot of money were you know 2
01:33 3 bucks
01:33 below normal and then like some GPS
01:38 sticks he had [ __ ] like so expensive
01:41 sorry my French here you can get nubs
01:44 for about 6 or 7 bucks online Steve was
01:47 trying to pawn them off or 10 to 12
01:49 bucks like 1199 or something like a nub
01:51 and that was a tiny little stick even
01:53 though it burns really slow it's
01:55 well-made stick it's a beautiful state
01:57 12 bucks no way it's so nice out here
02:00 it's crazy
02:01 I got adjust the camera kickstand though
02:03 you know it's running about 20 years ago
02:06 when I was getting into filmmaking
02:07 myself I bought a buncha really like
02:11 really high-end equipment and one of
02:13 whom was the tripod I use for this which
02:15 you've seen in the other intros but it's
02:17 a no it's really nice and it's super
02:21 heavy and so every time I have to move
02:23 something around it's like a it's like a
02:26 probably middle range mid range intro
02:29 professional tripod there's some random
02:34 information for you so today we're gonna
02:36 talk about something called fear porn
02:38 now I have s/m episodes in the queue
02:42 coming I'm editing the Nazi secret base
02:46 one right now then after that I have one
02:48 that's gonna be called your your
02:49 greatest threats to your life right this
02:54 one is I got another one too
02:58 the alien invasion yeah but this one is
03:02 gonna be about mmm
03:04 sort of like when someone said hey could
03:06 you please cover the JFK assassination I
03:08 was like hey man he's just one of many
03:10 that died as a result of these douche
03:12 bags and 60s killing people to get ahead
03:15 right and so instead I made an episode
03:18 called killing our heroes and it's got a
03:21 blinking in it and JFK Malcolm X MLK and
03:27 RFK plus some other celebrities in it so
03:30 if that's interesting to you then
03:32 definitely watch that one but people are
03:35 asking me to cover the coronavirus now
03:37 this episode's coming out will already
03:38 have addressed some of that stuff but
03:40 then the data gets updated so I'm trying
03:42 to get this Nazi base one out it's just
03:46 an esoteric episode and I'm trying to
03:48 find photographs to make it better now
03:51 some of you heard of David Icke I'm
03:54 gonna mention him because I'm gonna
03:56 throw him a prop in the beginning of
03:57 this David and I completely don't agree
04:01 on a lot of things but then we do
04:05 totally agree on some things some very
04:07 important things some things he brought
04:09 to me and he said this is this is the
04:11 way it works and I was like oh yeah that
04:12 is the way it works and so to that
04:15 degree I have to salute he does these
04:19 seven to eight hour presentations at
04:21 Wembley Stadium in England I think
04:25 that's it and they're just exhaustive
04:28 and amazing and what I have to commend
04:31 him for is he keeps an open mind with a
04:33 lot of esoteric things he's the guy that
04:35 really punches the the reptile reptile
04:39 alien theory okay which I you know I
04:43 think one of my facebook accounts I
04:45 still subscribe to him he's a big Trump
04:47 basher and he loves Tulsi Gabbard Tulsi
04:50 Gabbard does one of these uh
04:52 thank exactly hurt she does like the
04:56 Illuminati salute so I think she's very
04:59 interesting and smart and pretty but
05:03 yeah so that's where we kind of differ
05:05 but he coined something that I think I
05:10 think it was him that coined it which is
05:11 problem reaction solution right and that
05:15 is the mechanism beneath fear porn what
05:20 do I mean by fear porn well if it's not
05:22 blatantly obvious to you yeah it is the
05:26 SARS viruses the swine flu the bird flu
05:30 the Ebola the recent one to Carano virus
05:35 right its global warming
05:38 it's the ozone layer it's all this
05:40 [ __ ] stuff they try to manipulate you
05:43 into submission by basically broadsiding
05:48 you with stuff that you at the moment
05:53 you're hit with it you may or may not
05:55 have any scientific background in it and
05:57 so you're gonna have to get really
05:58 updated really quickly to to figure out
06:00 what your opinion is and then maybe you
06:02 don't agree with these lunatics that are
06:04 trying to create a solution based on
06:08 creating a problem and offering a
06:10 reaction and then offering the solution
06:13 right so think about how many people
06:15 right now and the coronavirus hype pool
06:19 are you know trying to get masks like
06:22 like surgical masks are completely sold
06:26 out all over the United States let alone
06:28 other countries right you know it's
06:30 funny I read a report try to tell people
06:32 look you're not just completely immune
06:36 from anything that's airborne because
06:38 you have a mask on yeah
06:40 in all reality you really are fairly
06:42 well protected but if you have a beard
06:44 for instance they said shave your beard
06:46 off if you're gonna wish you're trying
06:47 to wear a mask to stop something from
06:49 going in your face because the beard
06:50 provides way too many you know permeable
06:54 places were an airborne thing could get
06:57 around mmm RNA viruses don't exist
07:00 outside the human body for very long
07:01 they just don't a protein virus which is
07:05 mad cow the obse brain virus that made
07:10 your brain Swiss cheese a protein virus
07:13 is nearly indestructible and that's
07:15 what's terrifying about those so what
07:18 could I possibly talk about besides
07:20 telling you that a lot of the stuff they
07:24 bring to us is not what they say it is
07:28 because we're gonna go through some of
07:29 those things because it's important for
07:31 us to remember the history of and
07:33 there's memes going around suggesting
07:35 this but they've brought so many fake
07:37 things to the table and what they're
07:41 really suggesting is that either the
07:43 earth is an extremely fragile place that
07:45 can't handle its own ecosystem or man is
07:48 so flawed that we're creating problems
07:52 for ourselves right let me remind you
07:57 because it's in the other episode too
07:59 this is something you need to repeat one
08:02 to yourself because you've been
08:03 incredibly doctor indoctrinated no
08:05 matter how resilience that you are
08:08 everything that that like a Greta thumb
08:11 burg what a name what it looks just like
08:14 ER we'll bring up to the citizens of the
08:18 first world are not decisions that we
08:20 make as a human race we don't choose our
08:23 power sources right we don't choose how
08:26 a car is engineered great we don't
08:28 choose oil and a petrol dollar and all
08:31 that stuff right we don't the leader of
08:34 the world do the ruling class of the
08:36 world do so why isn't Greta talking to
08:38 them United States and Europe all of
08:42 your plus Britain and Australia New
08:44 Zealand Ireland we are not creating a
08:49 population problem we haven't done it
08:52 once the white man in those countries
08:55 has not done one overpopulated moment in
08:57 history okay
09:01 China has India has I don't even think
09:05 Africa has created a problem yet okay
09:07 I'm not sure South America has created a
09:10 problem but China and India are out of
09:13 [ __ ] control
09:14 well who's talking to them nobody
09:19 and you know why because it really isn't
09:21 perceived as a problem at the tippy top
09:22 of this world so some of us you know at
09:26 times most likely will feel angry at
09:29 China for having too many [ __ ] people
09:31 will feel angry at India for having too
09:33 many people all right
09:36 well those are probably mislead thoughts
09:41 go look at Google Earth zoom down on
09:45 India and zoom down on China and look
09:47 around look around how much land they
09:50 haven't remotely occupied China has how
09:53 many ghost cities capable of housing
09:56 another 850 million people and they're
09:59 completely empty okay let's see how all
10:03 those buildings fare when people try to
10:04 live in them after they've been dormant
10:05 for 20 years and the elements have just
10:07 eaten him alive you probably go inside
10:10 and be oh whoa the building falls over
10:13 all right
10:14 maybe it's not a problem don't know
10:17 don't feel like it's a problem I mean
10:19 the rate of growth could be an issue but
10:23 it's not the United States of America
10:24 growing too fast it's not all of Europe
10:26 groping and growing too fast Europe is
10:27 shrinking it's shrinking away whereas
10:31 all the invention come from in the world
10:34 what's China known for China is known
10:36 for having an entire army of folks to
10:40 reverse engineer and rip off first world
10:43 country ideas because they seem to lack
10:46 the ingenuity in their race it which is
10:49 really governed only by their form of
10:52 government to create these things are
10:56 they brilliant people yeah absolutely
10:59 absolutely for what they create over
11:01 there right but we're I'm making an
11:04 example here that feels confrontational
11:06 so that we can sort of bring it up there
11:08 you know some of the stereotypical
11:10 thoughts that we have and then talk
11:12 about it India yeah well there's a lot
11:15 of scammers out of India because they
11:17 learn how to speak English better than
11:18 the Chinese and so they can call all the
11:20 elderly people of the world to scam
11:22 amount of money that's just a tiny
11:24 little part of India most of Indians and
11:28 Chinese people probably just mind their
11:30 own business not even thinking about us
11:32 over here
11:33 all right okay
11:36 what are some of the other sort of
11:38 fear-mongering stuff that goes on well
11:41 is your esoteric stuff we talk about
11:43 from time to time NASA buying a bunch of
11:45 articles on the news or getting it for
11:48 free about meteorites and you know black
11:51 holes they're gonna swallow us all up
11:53 and you know the CERN Hadron Collider
11:55 trying to make you think the universe is
11:56 so unstable it's just gonna unravel one
11:58 day as if we don't have enough [ __ ]
12:03 [ __ ] you know the daily pressures of
12:06 a dual income household with the cost of
12:10 kids and taxes and all those [ __ ] you
12:14 know poorly run cities and states that
12:16 have homelessness and mental illness
12:18 through the roof the more that you care
12:21 about your fellow man oh my god it gets
12:23 kind of overwhelming after a while
12:25 doesn't it you don't want this to be the
12:27 way the world works Dee hmm fear porn
12:33 what's interesting about this episode
12:35 and I'm gonna try to get it out is
12:37 SuperDuper quick which I don't know I
12:39 may insert it before those others is
12:43 that you're right now in the middle of
12:45 this mental psychosis which is the
12:47 coronavirus fear-mongering you can see
12:51 it dr. drew said it best ma'am he goes
12:55 man because the press are almost
12:58 categorically unqualified to talk about
13:01 medical pandemics and he goes because
13:07 the press has which is all liberal based
13:10 George Soros EU globalist deep state
13:15 [ __ ] who have worked for the
13:17 CIA since the mid 50s right the corrupt
13:20 CIA segment which may or may not still
13:22 exist the Mockingbird project right all
13:25 your Anderson Cooper's who did their
13:26 [ __ ] you know internship at the CIA
13:30 alright because of them they're trying
13:35 to crash the economy right I have so
13:37 many friends in Los Angeles who are just
13:40 getting their businesses started because
13:42 of Donald Trump's amazing
13:45 tax relief his amazing augmentation of
13:50 the stock market via tariff reforming
13:53 and all this aid that's being pulled
13:55 back the United States that is propping
13:57 up my friends like never before they're
14:00 getting their dreams for the very first
14:01 time but they are surrounded by a bunch
14:04 of liberal people gorgeous worker bees
14:06 who don't know [ __ ] they don't know [ __ ]
14:09 from shinola as they used to say and
14:10 they have to hear in fact I can't even
14:14 wait for some of my friends to hear
14:15 their employees cheer on the collapse of
14:20 the economy because the next sentence of
14:23 my friends mouth will be you're fired
14:25 get the [ __ ] out of here because you're
14:27 you're actually hoping that my business
14:30 crashes which pays your [ __ ] bills
14:32 but because you're some snot-nosed kid
14:33 it doesn't know how the [ __ ] world
14:35 works I near a Bernie bro or what are
14:38 the [ __ ] at Bernie brah whatever hop on
14:40 out of here go work at the [ __ ]
14:43 coffee shop that you hope can't employ
14:46 you because you hope that they close
14:48 because you hope that the economy gets
14:50 destroyed like Bill Maher and what is in
14:54 our kit but dr. Drew said you know I
14:58 won't be able to identify a real
14:59 pandemic because you report absolutely
15:01 nothing as a pandemic people right now
15:05 this is a March 3rd technically March
15:08 4th now 14,000 people have already died
15:11 this year the United States of America
15:12 due to regular influenza which is one of
15:15 about three hundred and sixty-five
15:16 strands okay so coronavirus is about
15:21 eight and it's Aldous evergreen [ __ ]
15:23 old folks home up in Washington State oh
15:25 yeah if you get your relative and
15:27 evergreen join up there you pull them
15:30 out because they're going around you
15:31 know just injecting these people with
15:33 Grenaa virus killing them so they can
15:36 have a few statistics to keep this from
15:39 being a lie right was it Trump's
15:44 assuming the at the New York Times or
15:47 The Washington Post was too because for
15:49 defamation for suggesting and accusing
15:52 him of a bunch of [ __ ] that he never did
15:53 as if it was fact okay
15:57 so they don't want that to happen again
15:59 for the coronavirus that they have
16:01 pumped up all right so they're making it
16:07 happen now evergreen evergreens the code
16:10 word for all their shenanigans men just
16:13 look it up well go Q and on evergreen
16:15 and you'll be blown away so David I came
16:19 up with this problem reaction solution
16:20 which is his moderate interpretation of
16:22 order out of chaos which is on the back
16:25 of the American one dollar bill order
16:29 out of chaos has been the philosophy of
16:30 those who control us for a very very
16:32 long time it most likely happened as a
16:34 serendipitous experience in the past
16:37 where they realized oh my god this chaos
16:39 really allowed us to come together as a
16:40 people and they like what if we were to
16:43 actually create a faux version of that a
16:45 fake version of that mmm cam listening
16:49 all right well this that any other thing
16:50 okay they tried out boom they get total
16:54 control over the people holy [ __ ] this
16:57 is a new magic trick to get our way in
17:00 society hence religion how's religion
17:05 get involved prom reaction solution
17:08 what's problem problem is that you have
17:09 original sin who says who mother [ __ ]
17:13 says who original sin all right
17:17 and then what's your reaction to it well
17:19 they know you're gonna go through this
17:20 whole fight-or-flight cool Burroughs
17:22 thing and then what's the solution give
17:26 on to Caesar what is Caesar's
17:28 give your 10% to the church oh and by
17:33 the way we have a after-school program
17:35 for all your kids so these pedophiles
17:37 can screw with your kids mm-hmm oh and
17:43 when you find out if that's actually
17:45 occurring in the Catholic Church you'll
17:46 never see any justice they'll move the
17:49 preacher around to the point where
17:51 you've lost track of them and by the
17:53 time he goes to court he's 95 years old
17:55 he's already touched 10,000 kids and
17:57 it's over no justice the kid didn't like
18:01 the experience then they're gonna be
18:02 scarred for life hmm maybe you shouldn't
18:07 about the problem in the first place
18:08 that somehow God created you with this
18:10 original sin
18:11 just usin logic would you write if you
18:15 were God would you do that to your
18:16 people well what do you mean no oh you
18:19 make a bunch of people in your image
18:20 okay yeah I got it because what else
18:22 could you do you only know what you are
18:24 we're going to make a you know six
18:25 legged human with five heads and two
18:27 eyes no you don't know how that works so
18:29 you make them in your own image okay
18:32 now might not be a literal thing in
18:35 terms of our Homo sapiens sapiens but
18:38 then you're gonna guilt-trip them right
18:40 for the very beginning
18:41 yeah totally absolutely know so let's go
18:45 through some of these gems would you
18:49 let's do it
18:50 ozone layer how many of you remember the
18:54 ozone layer scare the who was free on
18:58 freon freon was causing the ozone layer
19:01 to just have the big hole in it you
19:03 shouldn't you know gyre here are sorry
19:06 uh who's free your hair into place with
19:09 what is Aqua Net or whatever it was
19:12 because you're hurting the atmosphere
19:14 mm-hmm you know what that really was
19:18 DuPont had the worldwide patent on freon
19:23 meaning if you wanted to cool something
19:25 off with freon you had to pay do pun
19:29 alright well guess what DuPont in the
19:32 early 80s was their patent was coming up
19:35 and it was going to expire which meant
19:38 anyone in the world could make for you
19:40 any DuPont was gonna lose a
19:41 multibillion-dollar industry so they
19:46 were ingenious evil people they
19:50 immediately I think the earliest number
19:52 I heard was 1982 they said that the
19:57 DuPont company started lobbying the
20:00 Senators and House representatives to
20:02 start this underground campaign to
20:06 eventually demonize freon and sure
20:10 enough by the end of the 80s in the
20:12 early 90s even got into a Star Trek
20:13 episode man data the character by played
20:17 by uh was a brent Spiner that his name
20:20 not his fault but he had to say a line
20:24 about the
20:25 ozone layer in the 20th century blah
20:28 blah blah
20:29 okay well now why would DuPont do that
20:32 why would DuPont demonize their own
20:34 product just because they're losing the
20:36 patent I mean they just sore losers mmm
20:39 DuPont had the only replacement they
20:42 could do the same exact thing that was a
20:44 little bit safer
20:45 I forgot the active ingredient that
20:48 actually supposed to interact with ozone
20:50 wrong and hey maybe it is a problem but
20:52 the idea is they had freon banned its
20:57 globally by this this problem that then
21:02 had this reaction that was fed to us
21:04 through the narrative of television both
21:06 the news in Star Trek for [ __ ] sake
21:08 and then the solution was you could only
21:12 use DuPont's replacement at least in
21:15 modern countries right you can still use
21:17 a bunch of weird [ __ ] in different
21:18 countries you can I think it's straight
21:20 up freon from old countries they're from
21:22 third world countries okay which means
21:25 it's not really a global problem right
21:27 all these global problems where the
21:31 cause is a you know in regard to their
21:36 narrative right it's always America and
21:39 Europe and related countries of course
21:43 which is Britain and everybody I just
21:45 mentioned a second ago we have to stop
21:48 doing it but Africa South America India
21:51 and China they never get the phone call
21:54 they can continually do it at a 7.5
21:56 billion Europe and America only make
22:00 about what 1.2 1.3 billion total with
22:03 Australia New Zealand Britain and you
22:05 know Scotland Scotland and Ireland right
22:08 and I apologize if I'm abusing that
22:11 those words I think some it was at Great
22:14 Great Britain I think maybe the whole
22:17 thing and the United Kingdom is just I
22:20 think England so if I'm butchering that
22:24 I apologize ok so that's how free on wit
22:27 now what else is like free on this
22:29 happened recently before we skip it did
22:31 some of these other ones incandescent
22:33 light bulbs got demonized regular old
22:37 filament
22:38 Edison light bulbs and what was the what
22:41 was the the the [ __ ] story they use
22:46 up too much power oh really I've seen my
22:51 power bill okay there's no gross use of
22:55 power you know what gross use of power
22:57 is a computer a cell phone an LED TV a
23:01 stereo system a hairdryer a hair
23:05 straightener whatever those things suck
23:07 down massive power a refrigerator a
23:12 washer and dryer a washing machine for
23:14 your dishwasher right where we demonize
23:17 light bulbs they're just like an infant
23:20 essa mph lip print on the carbon system
23:23 right so what did they do and by the way
23:27 they could make light bulbs that last
23:28 forever but they don't I said this a
23:31 couple times my refrigerator and my
23:33 washer and dryer dryer which has a bulb
23:36 in it are 17 years old they got them
23:39 literally the month that I moved into
23:40 this house the light bulb still works in
23:43 my refrigerator and the light bulb still
23:44 works in my dryer and I've never
23:46 replaced them these outside lights that
23:50 you see never had replaced them the
23:53 light bulb on the front of my house and
23:54 all the labels inside my house have all
23:57 had to be replaced numerous times
23:59 because they're meant to expire the
24:02 filament in the light bulb is made
24:04 inferior on purpose so that expires I
24:07 even buy five year to ten year
24:09 guaranteed light bulbs and yet they
24:10 never make it the [ __ ] am I going to put
24:12 it in a box and mail it back to him so
24:15 what did they give us in return was a
24:18 two-stage process right one we got these
24:21 super chemical laced mercury filled
24:25 lightbulbs which Trump is now talking
24:27 about and rightfully so he's making
24:30 incandescent light bulbs legal again
24:33 which is just that's why he's on our
24:35 side people but if you broke one of
24:38 these twisty turny light bulbs you had
24:41 to get away from the bulb because the
24:43 gas that's coming out of it it's mercury
24:46 you sniff that [ __ ] in your head you
24:48 will have permanent neural damage in
24:50 your brain because it will go up
24:52 your blood-brain barrier up in your
24:53 nostrils right at the top of your
24:55 nostrils Apex straight up into your
24:57 brain and start ripping the neuron coax
25:00 tissue off your nose making them die I
25:03 guess what it never leaves your brain
25:05 ever ever ever mm-hmm what a great
25:11 solution I don't know if I've ever been
25:14 around those bulbs and it broke but
25:16 you're supposed to call like a hazmat
25:17 team do you take the bulb out of your
25:19 kitchen of course they know no one's
25:21 gonna do it and they're never gonna
25:22 enforce it just was thinking a waste
25:24 facility I mean seriously yeah let's
25:27 think about the carbon credit our carbon
25:30 taxation footprint driving your [ __ ]
25:32 car to some dump to get rid of a bulb oh
25:36 and they ended up using a lot more power
25:39 that an incandescent light bulb oh go
25:40 figure
25:42 little tiny filament of metal is just
25:44 being heated by the friction of
25:46 electrons and there's other gas argon
25:49 thing with mercury in it and stuff your
25:52 brain should have just immediately said
25:53 this has a lot more moving parts than
25:56 this one so this was gonna take more
25:58 juice to stimulate what's inside what's
26:02 the replacement the replacement is LED
26:04 light bulbs they're definitely getting
26:07 better but they flicker they flicker
26:11 like fluorescent light bulbs although
26:12 the speed is a little bit better the
26:15 pulse width modulation is a little
26:17 faster alright but now you're sitting in
26:21 the room 50% of the time you're in the
26:23 dark and 50% of the time you're in the
26:25 light if they vary the alternating
26:27 current to your house they could
26:28 actually control how much the flicker
26:31 happens in your house thus putting you
26:34 into a suggestive state of thought again
26:41 the television let's remember so this a
26:45 few times but you guys have to repeat
26:47 this stuff so that we can get the lunacy
26:49 and the intrude their designs out they
26:56 told us back in the late 30s that a
26:57 television had to refresh 60 frames a
26:59 second otherwise you wouldn't weren't
27:01 gonna be able to see animation but you
27:04 go to a movie theater and
27:06 it's 24 frames a second for almost the
27:08 entire span of Hollywood and I think
27:10 maybe now it's 29 point whatever 9 some
27:14 other thing yeah they make it some
27:15 movies here and there that are 40 frames
27:16 a second but over the whole audience is
27:18 getting pukey sick hmm that's
27:21 interesting they've done tests because
27:25 of the flicker towards your eye you're
27:28 in a suggestive state you're in a state
27:30 of suggestibility well what's happening
27:32 to your television it's reality man it's
27:36 reality well it's nice now that we have
27:38 Netflix and Hulu and Amazon HBO and all
27:42 these things and now we just watch
27:42 fiction so now at least we were watching
27:44 something we don't think it's true you
27:47 watch YouTube the news a commercial IR
27:52 once okay so I grew up technically
27:58 speaking in the first five years of the
28:01 Vietnam War as a kid I was in Germany
28:03 for the first three of those and then in
28:06 America for the last two of those okay
28:09 the news is pretty gruesome guerillas
28:13 they were guerrillas all over the place
28:15 you know they were South American
28:17 guerrillas they were African guerrillas
28:20 bla bla everybody was against us as a
28:21 guerrilla right meaning a non-affiliated
28:25 military force that is attacking our
28:28 force me not affiliated with a
28:29 particular government they're just their
28:31 own little militia and I saw something
28:35 in the last year where someone was
28:36 addressing the fact that you know sort
28:40 of like the Larry Flynt argument in the
28:43 movie where Woody Harrelson played him
28:44 which is you can't put sex on TV but you
28:47 can put war on TV blood and guts no
28:50 problem and there was a mathematical
28:54 reason that they ended up doing this
28:56 which is you're watching the news and
28:58 it's horrific then a commercial comes on
29:02 it's mr. clean it's the Jolly Green
29:05 Giant selling you [ __ ] peas man and
29:07 that was better in terms of an
29:11 environment in terms of a experience
29:14 such that you're like oh well at least
29:17 I'm good like by cleaning products
29:19 least I can eat peas all day right
29:22 everything was better your Chrysler
29:24 Cordoba your kei car whatever it was it
29:27 was better your toothpaste that's been
29:29 improved right so in order to de-stress
29:32 you wouldn't bought products isn't it
29:35 interesting that hoarders always have
29:37 some sort of traumatic experience in
29:40 their past they've lost a loved one
29:41 they've been sick them in a car wreck
29:44 whatever and if they weren't like raised
29:46 to be hoarders by a hoarding parent
29:48 which happens there's usually something
29:53 that's traumatic being broke can make
29:57 you a hoarder right people who are
29:59 stranded on Islands come back and they
30:00 end up hiding things around their house
30:03 for no reason because they had to hide
30:06 their food from predators that to make
30:08 sure they didn't starve to death when
30:09 they were on the island or if you have
30:11 other indigenous peoples he had to keep
30:14 him from stealing your stuff right now
30:17 I'm in an episode called trauma
30:18 programming there sorry trauma
30:20 journalism excuse me it's something I
30:23 termed in one-page news.com I never
30:26 heard the term before but now as I hear
30:27 it go back to me I wonder where it truly
30:30 originated but it is this whole thing of
30:36 fight or flight I think I just meant
30:37 just this in the episode of me the other
30:39 day but it's a it's related to how your
30:43 brain works
30:45 you need your brain to be fully
30:47 functional in order to be a sentient
30:49 being that is why is there is a
30:51 difference between you and a bear coming
30:53 at you if a bear was a sentient being a
30:56 self-aware creature that looked in the
30:58 mirror what no check yeah those hairs if
31:01 they were if they were completely
31:03 self-aware then they would develop a
31:05 society a language they would become
31:07 sophisticated at some point and if a
31:09 bears come and you go hey wait wait wait
31:11 wait I got some food over here it's much
31:14 better than me man oh really yeah okay
31:17 did you do duh right you know it doesn't
31:20 happen though does it they come right at
31:22 you and that's what a human being can be
31:25 if it gets into a fight or flight
31:26 scenario because your frontal lobes it
31:29 was a big forehead right here right your
31:30 frontal lobes are your
31:33 learning pattern recognizers that
31:36 understand you know you know a guy who
31:40 talked to me like that in the past
31:41 completely screwed me over or a girl who
31:44 said this to me was lying or you know I
31:48 think this is a man-made object in the
31:50 sky instead of a UFO okay
31:54 but when they traumatize the [ __ ] out of
31:57 you
31:58 you have barely in a any ability to
32:01 discern what you're taking in and they
32:04 understand this which is why they love
32:06 reporting horrific news to you
32:08 constantly I've mentioned this three or
32:10 four seasons ago but it's very important
32:12 because this is what for your porn does
32:13 to you how many times have you heard
32:16 someone say or even yourself say you
32:19 know I was just I was so terrified I
32:23 just did the first thing that you know
32:25 seemed logical to me and looking back it
32:27 wasn't the most brilliant thing I could
32:29 have done but it kept me alive or
32:31 whatever that is someone trying to
32:34 describe what fighter flight actually
32:36 feels like you don't have your brain at
32:41 most you reduce yourself down to your
32:44 instinctual logic as well your body has
32:48 an ability to speed up your frame rate
32:51 how many of you been in a car accident
32:53 where as the accident is occurring time
32:57 is double triple quadruple in your brain
33:01 in terms of being able to recognize
33:02 what's going on one of my buddies when I
33:04 first moved to California I was running
33:05 a room out of his place he was an 18
33:08 year old kid totally successful he got
33:11 in a car accident someone hit his hit
33:13 him from the front hood and he came home
33:16 and he goes you know what was weird was
33:19 like as the car was crunching which took
33:22 a split second to happen he was I could
33:25 see the hood just folding towards me
33:29 alright there's a little bit to be
33:33 figured out there isn't there right on
33:36 the day of 9/11 a bunch of people like
33:38 myself were just utterly completely in
33:41 shock
33:43 were sort of morbidly mystified like
33:47 watching a car crash a nascar f1 or the
33:51 Indy 500 were rubbernecking television
33:54 watching these towers explode but then
33:59 as we start to be told that the towers
34:01 had 10,000 people in them because that's
34:03 what they said that morning oh my god I
34:05 mean we just think about flesh ripping
34:07 apart and all this other stuff and I
34:09 think God was far less folks in the
34:11 building but then you know two seconds
34:17 before this occurred no one could have
34:18 ever imagined this Osama bin Laden
34:21 character did it and then after it came
34:23 in within the hour of the collapse the
34:25 second collapse oh it was that guy and
34:28 it was over and over and over and over
34:30 again now we're all sitting at home in
34:31 total fight-or-flight in some state of
34:34 fight-or-flight our ability to assert
34:36 and it's gone away so it's going
34:39 straight into long-term memory and if
34:40 someone says who did that you just look
34:42 it up boom
34:43 long-term memory you get all the
34:44 chemical endorphin feelings that this is
34:47 an old memory because your frontal lobes
34:50 never saw it and you go sama bin Laden
34:54 for sure you sure about that I was up
34:58 late at night in December of that same
35:00 year and there was a press conference it
35:04 was like a breaking news thing press
35:05 conference where they said the dude died
35:07 due to his blood what do they call a
35:14 transfusion machine or whatever he just
35:17 died as a result of his ongoing health
35:20 issues in a cave somewhere in December
35:23 early early does I want to say December
35:26 first but I may be recalling that
35:28 incorrectly so I saw this on TV and then
35:31 it never happened the next day it was
35:33 like oh you're that yeah now I think
35:36 that was a Mis report oh yeah II still I
35:38 we still have to fear the boogeyman and
35:39 then we got all these cassette tape
35:42 recordings from the dude you guys
35:43 remember that cassette tape recordings
35:45 from a dude and there's a bunch of
35:47 videotapes of him but his lips don't
35:49 match what they say he's saying he's you
35:53 know
35:54 people that can read lips or deaf or
35:57 Arab arenas lips going he's not saying
36:00 what they're saying he's saying and by
36:02 the way the loop he's saying the same
36:04 thing over and over and over again and
36:06 in different places in this because they
36:08 keep cutting the same footage over and
36:10 over and over again and who the hell is
36:13 this guy doesn't look like - do we know
36:15 fear manipulating us into killing other
36:20 people so what are the species of the
36:25 solution oh I just said one we have fear
36:31 that is put in us through fake means to
36:35 hurt other people to kill millions of
36:39 other people then we have fear that
36:43 makes us kill ourselves don't eat that
36:46 egg yolk right a footprint here a
36:50 footprint there carbon this carbon that
36:52 you start ingesting poisons bad foods
36:56 all you got to eat GMO mangos but Papa
36:58 better take your vaccinations get some
37:03 mercury and aluminum in your brain for
37:04 the rest of your life enjoy that little
37:07 cocktail right the other one and the
37:13 most dangerous one which if you could
37:16 even conceive of one that's more
37:18 dangerous than killing someone else or
37:20 slowly killing yourself it would be
37:23 succumbing to control mechanisms as a
37:26 result of a fear mongering practice now
37:32 I don't talk about this too much on this
37:34 show because it is truly a dark subject
37:36 but I'm gonna pierce the veil for just a
37:40 split second now in my smoke lounge we
37:46 used to monitor all of these mass
37:50 shootings school mass shootings marathon
37:54 bombings Mall shootings nightclub
37:57 shootings all this stuff remember they
37:59 used to happen all the time I mean over
38:03 a dozen happened on Obama's watch
38:06 isn't that interesting I mean every one
38:09 of them smells fishy not saying people
38:13 don't die if they smell really fishy
38:17 every single one of them from teachers
38:19 saying they said they weren't gonna use
38:21 real bullets to you know guys pretend to
38:26 get their legs blown off but they
38:29 already did in Afghanistan and their
38:31 friends turned them in okay not to
38:35 mention that a lot of people seem to be
38:37 at the same locations between different
38:40 events right one person one woman is a
38:42 jogger the same woman turns up as an
38:45 attorney for the kid in Colorado she
38:46 also turns up as a parent and Sandy Hook
38:49 she turns up at the Florida shootings I
38:51 mean like we got photographs of them in
38:54 some cases they're talking for a whole
38:56 interview same voice same face I mean
38:58 it's not just the doppelganger for
39:00 Christ's sake okay so at the lounge and
39:04 I I said to I think even said it on the
39:08 show once I said you know how Trump
39:12 could stop this if it is truly what we
39:14 think it is I won't even say on this
39:17 video because you guys can infer quite
39:21 accurately what I'm suggesting since
39:25 these people seem to show up at these
39:27 events and of course these events are
39:29 always being incubated by some deep
39:31 state group again whether they whether
39:35 people come away completely unscathed
39:37 and end up at a halftime at a Super Bowl
39:40 and and what is that all the girls have
39:43 been caught at a tropical resort
39:45 together I mean one doppelganger at a
39:47 tropical resort doesn't mean anything
39:50 but every single person that was
39:51 supposed to have died is all in a
39:54 tropical resort together exactly the
39:57 Aged of difference between when this
39:58 photo was taken and when they were
40:00 supposed to have perished in a
40:01 particular event hmm well I said to my
40:05 buddies that the line just said what
40:06 Trump could do is go and arrest and
40:09 incarcerate maybe military tribunal all
40:13 these folks that seem to be actors
40:17 at these events again doesn't bring
40:22 people back from the dead but it's
40:25 certainly you put them in a military
40:27 tribunal and Gitmo and they're all
40:31 losers right
40:33 someone's gonna crack someone's gonna
40:36 grab them with for the women that have
40:37 been in up to five different there's two
40:39 different women that have been in five
40:40 different events okay you pin him down
40:45 and you say look you are never gonna see
40:47 the light of day ever ever we're gonna
40:50 put you in a hole that's underneath the
40:52 [ __ ] an outhouse man for all the other
40:54 prisoners here if you don't start
40:56 coughing up some real proof about who
40:59 hired you how did you get involved in
41:02 this thing you got a name names and
41:05 those names have got to work out because
41:07 we're gonna go raid these homes of
41:09 people that you name and that you finger
41:11 and if they don't turn up with more
41:12 evidence that they're involved if it
41:14 doesn't turn out that you're telling us
41:15 the truth I don't know hang upside down
41:19 the pit of horrendous stuff whatever and
41:24 lo and behold in the last year it got
41:28 kind of quiet and we're wondering is
41:31 this just them losing control or is this
41:34 them getting prosecuted is that them
41:36 they're planning the next gigantic one
41:39 Lionel nation he said you know we got a
41:42 brace for the fact that they may try to
41:45 pull another big one but it is very
41:47 difficult to pull those big ones from
41:49 September 11th without complicit
41:52 government agencies which is never gonna
41:54 happen again as long as his current
41:55 dudes in office oh you switch you switch
41:59 horses in the middle of this one I don't
42:04 know if Hollywood could Imagineer what
42:07 will happen next I mean and that's my
42:09 that's my caution slash fear to everyone
42:12 else they want control back and you know
42:17 it and that's gonna come with a crashed
42:19 economy because a bunch of people are
42:21 getting rich right now which means they
42:23 have power and they're gaining what back
42:25 as a result of gaining wealth and upper
42:28 mobility control of their life
42:32 one of the big things that you gain by
42:34 not being fearful is the ability to be a
42:37 critical thinker look at all the
42:41 Liberals they're buying every single
42:42 fear-mongering thing on planet Earth and
42:45 so what do you do they hug a teddy bear
42:47 of the solution from problem reaction
42:49 solution global warming so they hang on
42:52 to all those [ __ ] not for one second
42:56 paying attention to the logic of the
42:58 situation I got a friend who believes in
43:00 it very close friend I try to get to I
43:03 met with one of them today and when I
43:06 offer the older one the logic of well
43:09 okay so you say this is real why aren't
43:11 they talking to India and China the two
43:13 number-one polluters in the world
43:14 there's no strategy to control them next
43:19 subject changes the subject because he
43:24 ran out of his ammo it's it's the way to
43:28 feel superior perhaps I don't know my
43:32 other friend it's kind of a similar
43:38 experience there's just sort of this
43:39 deadpan look and I just know Jesus is
43:44 real I kind of look on their face the
43:45 climate change is real well yeah [ __ ]
43:48 changes man it's called planet Earth man
43:49 look at me right now it is probably
43:51 sixty-two degrees out here I mean it is
43:53 like feels tropical to me right now
43:56 now SARS hit in the early 2000 so 2003
44:01 as I remembered it was fairly
44:04 self-contained in Asia bird flu has come
44:09 and gone several times in my lifetime
44:10 even in just the last 20 years but in
44:16 2014 and 20 2015 there was this Ebola
44:19 thing and I've talked about outlined it
44:23 a couple times who knows exactly all of
44:27 the reasons why this stuff was reported
44:31 to be true but the one that came out
44:34 from our research at the lounge and
44:37 watching all these videos of people
44:38 faking illnesses like they were on a
44:40 pile of dead bodies supposedly and
44:42 everyone got up walked off you know
44:43 smile
44:44 laughing we saw people putting makeup on
44:46 people to make them look a little little
44:48 more jaundice shame shame but there's a
44:54 bunch of diamond mining going on in the
44:55 area they tried to go on strike and so
44:59 that immediately this Ebola thing shows
45:00 up they vaccinate the workers against
45:04 Ebola
45:04 they all die of Ebola or something that
45:08 they could blame on Ebola right I think
45:12 yes what bunch of brand new workers the
45:13 mine turns back on the union's busted
45:15 and boom diamond start farting out of
45:17 this place
45:18 alright problem reaction solution what's
45:23 the problem the union of workers of the
45:26 diamond miners want more money and they
45:28 want some safety and they want you know
45:31 participation may be profits or whatever
45:34 reaction we may need to diamond mine
45:38 people launched this Ebola thing because
45:40 it's a big African thing supposedly
45:41 right but movies about it
45:44 Dustin Hoffman solution we killed them
45:48 all and we got new workers and no one's
45:52 ever gonna pull that [ __ ] again because
45:54 that's what's going to happen to them
45:55 every single time it happens because
45:57 we're also gonna allow the rumor to
45:58 circulate among the diamond mine workers
46:01 but that's what actually happened let's
46:05 keep your mouth shut
46:06 take your money and shut up hmm alright
46:15 coronavirus very simple who's benefiting
46:19 from the coronavirus it's almost over
46:21 but who's benefiting from it
46:23 well news agencies that have had the
46:25 worst ratings on planet earth are
46:26 getting a tiny spike in ratings the deep
46:31 state is able to manipulate the stock
46:33 market claiming that it's a coronavirus
46:36 problem and they've managed to crash the
46:39 stock market and it rebound they just
46:41 took it down a little bit today but not
46:42 too much it's gonna rebound all the way
46:44 we had the highest rebound in stock
46:47 market history yesterday today were down
46:50 only 400 points right China got rid of
46:54 all the protesters off the streets in
46:56 Hong Kong but
46:57 you can expect interview back as soon as
46:58 possible and maybe they benefit from the
47:03 US stock market having a bit of an issue
47:06 kind of sending a message to Trump see
47:09 what we can do to hurt you hmm now I
47:15 don't know what's true so I'm just
47:16 suggesting that these could be
47:18 situations right but it's the safest flu
47:23 again right
47:24 swine flu came and went and it was one
47:28 of again one of the safest flus that we
47:29 ever had but they vaccinated a ton of
47:31 people number everyone getting in line
47:33 for the swine flu vaccination okay then
47:36 after that within six months of the
47:38 swine flu vaccination you have and you
47:40 can go read reports about this look up
47:42 swine flu vaccination neural damage at
47:47 the time I last read it it was slightly
47:49 under 50,000 but this is the early
47:51 report 50,000 people roughly he took the
47:55 swine flu vaccinations are now going to
47:57 suffer permanent neurological damage in
48:01 their body nerve damage as well so boom
48:07 you got a bit of a problem there was a
48:10 woman in Europe whose job for the last
48:13 20 years where she was a journalist that
48:15 covered the pharmaceutical industry in
48:17 Europe I want to say she was Swedish but
48:22 I'm not quite sure but she spoke such
48:23 good English it was very difficult to
48:24 find out where she was from but she was
48:28 in tears on the internet saying that
48:30 they were going to try and use this
48:32 vaccination to really kill off a bunch
48:34 of people and she cited a report that
48:39 said that the I mean this sounds like
48:42 fiction but at the time it was very easy
48:45 to find these articles to back up what
48:46 she was saying a gentleman was given
48:50 will actually rewind here when they made
48:52 the swine flu vaccination in Europe they
48:55 made it in one central location one
48:57 laboratory made the vaccination then
49:00 they gave out three samples in these
49:02 wild ass containers to then be
49:05 transported to the individual
49:07 pharmaceutical companies to then
49:09 synthesize it inside
49:11 lambs or whatever they were gonna do
49:12 right but one dude who had one of these
49:16 samples was riding on the subway or a
49:18 train of some sort
49:20 noobs a train probably went underground
49:22 above-ground underground all those kind
49:23 of things right and during the
49:26 transportation almost like a fringe
49:27 episode The Container he had exploded in
49:30 the Train and of course everyone catches
49:35 this stuff cuz it's all over the plane
49:37 when they tested the individuals and the
49:39 samples inside of the Train they also
49:42 found the h1n1 in one bird flew inside
49:48 this vaccination and so she was crying
49:51 and she was saying they're up to
49:53 something better done even those ladies
49:55 still alive who knows but this was her
49:57 forte this is what she did for a living
49:59 was report and every time she did a
50:01 video she recalled all of her you know
50:06 degrees and her accomplishments and how
50:08 long she'd been there 15 or 20 years
50:10 something like that it was a really long
50:12 career and she was probably in her late
50:13 40s at most early 50s if she was aging
50:17 really well but now what do they always
50:20 say right was that a manual guy that ran
50:24 Chicago into the ground he was caught on
50:27 camera saying you know we never let a
50:28 crisis go to waste
50:31 now you could construe that statement as
50:34 a positive but he's a deep state ER
50:36 and so you have to construe that as a
50:38 negative with 911 oh kinda [ __ ] happen
50:44 the amount of stuff they squeezed out of
50:47 a crisis was un-fuckin'-believable this
50:49 world has been a different place because
50:51 of all the squeezing they pulled out of
50:53 that one crisis let's just take a real
50:57 basic review of what happened to this
51:02 world after 9/11 well we went to war in
51:06 Afghanistan of course all the people
51:09 that supposedly are real the official
51:10 story are all Saudis of course they
51:14 found ten of them still alive
51:16 after the event had occurred and so they
51:19 just barely reported the passports may
51:20 have been stolen or something but we
51:22 invade Afghanistan
51:24 and we go in and we get Saddam Hussein
51:28 eventually quit nothing to do with it at
51:30 all we're gonna come back each one of
51:34 those we got the TSA we got the military
51:40 commissions Act which allowed the CIA to
51:43 torture children to get information out
51:45 of their parents
51:46 we got mandatory Fourth Amendment
51:49 violating eavesdropping on everyone in
51:51 the United States of America we got all
51:54 these taxes in America I don't know
51:55 about you guys overseas you can't take
51:57 any [ __ ] on a plane anymore because all
51:59 everything is a [ __ ] bomb
52:01 goddamn bottled waters [ __ ] bomb you
52:04 know I'm drinking it yeah yeah I'm
52:06 drinking this I don't know what is it
52:07 nitrate or some [ __ ] right yeah all
52:09 right unbelievable
52:12 why did we go to Afghanistan oh hell we
52:16 go to Afghanistan for have you ever seen
52:19 pictures of the place is the most ass
52:21 backwards on planet Earth sophistication
52:24 yeah it was us dropping a bunch of bombs
52:27 on well a lot of places were completely
52:31 uninhabited the amount of soldiers over
52:33 there going we're dropping bombs on
52:36 caves with nobody in them in fact the
52:39 caves when I go back like 10 feet
52:40 they're not a whole network of caves
52:43 like they kept saying remember they give
52:45 you those illustrations of the keys with
52:47 all the you know that kind of like Dig
52:50 Dug [ __ ] in it all [ __ ] okay I mean
52:54 you never saw those things remember the
52:57 the chemical Ali guy you know he said
53:00 that saw Saddam Hussein had weapons of
53:03 mass destruction and all this other crap
53:05 we know they lied about then but why go
53:07 to Afghanistan two reasons Taliban had
53:13 done two things piss off the United
53:15 States and the intelligence agencies
53:18 that work for the deep state you see the
53:20 CIA grows all of their poppy seeds in
53:23 Afghanistan one it's really far away too
53:27 it's got the perfect environment for it
53:30 so what do they do they grow it they
53:32 have people watch it and then they cut
53:35 it down they harvest it and they put it
53:37 in these piles ready to be processed and
53:39 picked up they put them on c-130s that
53:42 are forest commissioned c-130s they fly
53:44 them through turkey over the United
53:47 States probably ending in Arkansas and
53:49 distributed through America but they
53:51 also selling into the entire world don't
53:52 be don't be naive it's liquid cash worth
53:56 four point four trillion dollars in
53:58 heroin as the study from stay or
54:01 Berkeley University said that may
54:04 include cocaine two in the four point
54:05 four okay remember the staff that helped
54:12 us fight the war in Afghanistan it was
54:14 called the Northern Alliance you
54:16 remember that you know what they recall
54:18 before the war poppy seed farmers run by
54:25 warlords the dude that gets appointed as
54:29 the Acting President of Afghanistan at
54:32 the time well he was brothers with the
54:36 number one warlord that ran the area and
54:39 when he dares said after about a year of
54:41 - of this war the Americans were
54:44 changing their agreement just like Darth
54:45 Vader in the Cloud City right his
54:48 brother was murdered fact on video that
54:51 dude with the little straight hat I fret
54:53 I'm I'm confusing his name with the
54:55 human leader Kofi Annan on but it's for
54:58 cop that guy's name was anyway he almost
55:02 got killed on on a documentary where
55:05 they bombed really close to where he was
55:07 so as soon as we start the war by
55:10 November we are regrowing all the poppy
55:14 seeds and American soldiers are walking
55:16 through the fields photographs seen in
55:18 articles I remember it plain as day man
55:22 what else was going on over there that
55:25 made that a target well there was a
55:31 pipeline planned to go from Uzbekistan
55:35 down through Afghanistan and straight
55:38 through the tip of Pakistan to offload
55:40 it on to oil rigs
55:44 some pretty sweet crude stuff
55:48 Condoleezza Rice alone worked on this
55:50 deal with unical for over 10 years
55:53 there's a oil tanker named after her I
55:57 believe under the flag of Chevron and I
56:00 believe her main cohort in that
56:02 deal-making with Unocal was put on the
56:04 9/11 investigation Commission as well
56:08 well the Taliban didn't like drugs
56:13 unless so they cut it all down they cut
56:15 out all the poppy seeds but I understand
56:18 they didn't go after the reserves but we
56:22 grew it all back
56:23 soldiers were like just devastating here
56:25 we are growing this illegal drug I don't
56:27 even know what's going on but you
56:29 soldier keep your mouth shut right yes
56:30 sir
56:31 well the Taliban somehow gave the deal
56:35 to Russia just before 9/11 happened I
56:39 think it was in spring of the same year
56:41 oh you just messed with the petrodollar
56:45 buddy so the second we took all those
56:50 major cities in Afghanistan guess what
56:53 happens
56:53 unical gets awarded the oil contracts
56:57 guess who could build oil pipes
57:01 Halliburton guess who was a majority
57:04 shareholder in Halliburton meaning own
57:07 the most shares these are the 40% Dick
57:10 Cheney no big contract
57:12 Halliburton gets the whole pipeline and
57:15 the United States builds what I get from
57:17 when I remember 15 permanent bases up
57:19 and down the pipeline all the way down
57:21 left and right left and right to make
57:24 sure never got messed with
57:26 there's Afghanistan what was the big
57:30 story behind Saddam Hussein like why did
57:32 we go after him he denied it right away
57:36 and condemned the attacks ride away
57:38 so did Gaddafi man well the rumor was is
57:43 that he had attempted to kill George
57:45 Bush Senior after George was senior
57:48 decided not to take him out in 91 in
57:51 Desert Storm and loyalty is a big thing
57:54 with those folks
57:56 now maybe he did maybe he didn't in
57:58 terms of trying to go after him I think
58:00 he's even as ignorant as he might have
58:03 been or his brilliance might have been I
58:04 don't think he would have done that but
58:05 maybe but then they capture him in a
58:09 hole right he's got all these body
58:11 Devils all over the place
58:13 ap Reuters reporter said they saw him
58:15 get in a Chinook and fly away
58:18 so military US military picked him up in
58:21 downtown Baghdad flew him off
58:23 well he always said he was a CIA asset
58:25 didn't they hmm
58:28 well they seemed to pick him up in a
58:30 hole didn't know exactly where he was in
58:33 a [ __ ] hole like how do you figure
58:34 that out right because someone turned
58:35 him in okay let's say that happened and
58:39 then what did you see on the internet
58:41 right you saw a shitty cell phone video
58:43 of him being hung from a gallows inside
58:46 a building
58:47 it was very David Copperfield II he's up
58:51 there and he's got the big old thing on
58:53 his neck they dropped the flap he falls
58:57 down into this dark closet so you get to
59:00 see it it wasn't like a public display
59:02 which is their trend over there right
59:05 and so he falls down and this dude
59:07 doesn't quite catch the whole thing on
59:09 video and then you see the one I saw
59:11 which has been removed from the Internet
59:13 is that the guy came down a staircase
59:15 and pointed into a closet which
59:17 miraculously had a plenty of light on
59:19 him to be seen and of course he has the
59:22 thing around his neck as if it's all
59:24 magic trick right he's falling to
59:25 something softer it's not breaking his
59:27 neck and there is and then it went
59:31 around that that video was proof that
59:33 they didn't actually kill him that it
59:34 was fake hmm so what happened shortly
59:37 after that about within a couple weeks a
59:40 soldier does a video and again the one I
59:44 saw and I eat you have to understand
59:46 watch these things probably 10 times
59:48 just to kind of pick out little things
59:49 in the video it was a Jordanian Hospital
59:52 as I understand it it's completely empty
59:56 and a guy walks in broad daylight man
60:00 bright he walks down the hallway now we
60:02 looked this up the other day and it was
60:03 a little bit different it was very
60:04 interesting but they've got him on a you
60:08 know slab
60:10 there's no doctors there's no guards you
60:13 have Saddam Hussein supposedly dead with
60:16 his neck broken underneath the sheet and
60:18 they walk in and they pull whoever's
60:20 filming's pulling the sheet off and they
60:21 had this big where as Barry pumped
60:24 muscle on his throat and it definitely
60:26 looks like him how's this guy getting
60:29 this footage how is he getting out of
60:31 the place with the footage how come
60:32 there's no guards why would his body
60:34 just be sitting in a room temperature
60:36 room and let's let's rewind a second
60:41 here in time right wasn't 2013 or
60:44 something like that when Obama is poll
60:46 ratings were going through the floor all
60:48 of a sudden he comes up with the sama
60:50 bin Laden capture in Pakistan absolutely
60:55 no convincing footage that that SEAL
60:56 team ever took him out Obama had the
60:58 SEAL team killed right after that so mmm
61:01 you know didn't tell no tells right but
61:04 what did they do with the some of the
61:05 dogs body a burial at sea and initially
61:11 they pumped it as this was an Arab
61:13 tradition burial at sea
61:16 okay it's a sand base culture desert
61:21 sand culture and a burial at sea well
61:25 how the hell'd they do it like 2,000
61:26 years ago I mean I suppose everyone has
61:28 boats and stuff but I never heard any
61:29 sea burial ritual they realized that
61:32 that story was complete [ __ ] and so
61:34 they wreaked it to say no no no wasn't
61:35 the sea it was a speedy a speedy barrel
61:41 was the custom all right so let's think
61:45 this thing through again this is what so
61:48 beautiful by just thinking for yourself
61:50 man what did a some of in London
61:53 supposedly do you knocked down three
61:56 towers in New York
61:58 I mean supposedly to intentionally one
62:02 introvert
62:03 he at the Pentagon supposedly the other
62:08 plane well they think it might've been
62:09 headed for the White House or I don't
62:11 know some other location you don't
62:13 Barack you lessly have the phone number
62:15 to NORAD to stand down to make sure no
62:18 one ever intercepted these things right
62:21 he had a probably cellphone to Dick
62:23 Cheney make sure that the plane hit the
62:24 Pentagon because Dick Cheney was warned
62:26 for one room 10 minutes before the
62:28 Dulles Airport one hit the Pentagon as
62:31 it circled depending on he just let it
62:33 hit the pinata Lee cool yeah so that's
62:37 how many people he killed it was the
62:39 most it went down as the day of infamy
62:44 right just like the neo-cons with the
62:45 paper in the early 90s where Dick Cheney
62:47 specifically said in the document we're
62:49 gonna need a new Pearl Harbor if we're
62:50 gonna take over the Middle East hmm and
62:55 what did a saddam hussein do he called
62:58 the State Department asked for
63:00 permission to invade Libya or not Libya
63:03 uh Kuwait excuse me they said yes he
63:06 invades Kuwait the Saudis call the State
63:08 Department said what the hell do you
63:09 think you're doing get him out of there
63:11 they argue until they agree then they
63:14 call up Sodoma said could you get out of
63:15 Kuwait and he said look what the hell
63:17 you talking about I called you ask for
63:18 permission this is a huge operation this
63:19 is our old land and they said no sorry
63:23 we [ __ ] up you're gonna have to get
63:25 out of there and he says I'm not getting
63:26 out of here you don't get out of there
63:28 we're gonna come get you [ __ ] you and as
63:31 the storm happens right yes some
63:34 Americans got killed for sure horrible
63:37 situation he asked for permission
63:39 we took the permission away he didn't
63:43 abide by us right Osama bin Laden by any
63:47 stretch of the imagination destroyed the
63:48 world the problem reaction solution to
63:52 this formula was more control of them
63:54 over us right okay so some but none gets
64:02 the courtesy of a quick burial to hide
64:05 the fact that it was all [ __ ] in the
64:07 first place and Saddam Hussein is hung
64:12 and this magic act and then his bodies
64:16 in room temperature decomposing in this
64:19 [ __ ] hospital with the big raspberry
64:20 on his neck the next day where's his
64:25 speedy burial you see how the two don't
64:29 make any sense but we swallow this [ __ ]
64:32 because we're in the fear
64:34 we're in fear porn when we're told this
64:37 crap and so we don't discern anything we
64:39 don't think twice about anything it's
64:43 really hard for them at this point to
64:45 create fear and you know I have received
64:50 several phone calls and emails and
64:53 contact from people what are you scared
64:55 about this virus thing usually it's like
64:58 your soccer mom no not afraid anymore at
65:02 first I wasn't quite sure where they're
65:04 trying to drop the Georgia Guidestones
65:06 you know 99% virus or whatever but now I
65:10 don't think it's a big deal anymore hmm
65:15 and then you have to kind of struggle
65:17 with your friends not to panic but some
65:20 people they're just not susceptible this
65:23 stuff but they don't know anything at
65:24 all right so that's cool ignorance is
65:26 bliss maybe that's the best way to live
65:29 your life so that we don't lose you know
65:30 sleep or anything like that right now if
65:34 you haven't seen my episode future lies
65:36 you need to get into that because that's
65:37 the other advanced technique that they
65:39 use
65:43 climate change is a future lie well the
65:45 whole [ __ ] world is gonna melt oh my
65:48 god a goddamn glacier is supposed to
65:49 exist forever who says who says the
65:53 [ __ ] glacier supposed to be there were
65:54 you here a thousand years ago maybe it
65:56 wasn't here a thousand years ago and
65:57 then 500 years later it's here and then
66:00 a 500 years later it's gone if I learn
66:02 early years later it returns oh we know
66:05 why why the [ __ ] do you know well
66:08 because we're smart and we just made an
66:09 arbitrary [ __ ] decision that it
66:11 should still be here because we like the
66:12 way they look mm-hmm and they're so sure
66:17 about stages of Earth's history which is
66:22 just history point right ice ages they
66:28 keep telling us that there were ice ages
66:30 that kept resetting mankind and all this
66:32 other crap right yeah I'm sure we go
66:35 through some some cyclical heating and
66:39 cooling here and there if you go
66:42 research why they think ice ages occur
66:44 it's actually kind of funny boulders all
66:48 Builders rolled for a really long time
66:51 in their minds they make up all these
66:54 things as well look at carbon dating and
66:58 other techniques of dating things and
67:01 it's the hottest thing one year and then
67:03 10 years later the same exact scientists
67:06 that said this is the this is the [ __ ]
67:08 this is the way to date something the
67:10 valence on the outside are the coating
67:12 on the outside the patina on a rock is
67:14 their new one which is I think falling
67:16 apart now terms of a theory Al Gore's
67:19 whole reverse hockey stick thing was
67:22 gonna get all [ __ ] hot and global
67:24 warm us to death now anything that
67:27 occurs anything occurs is a global
67:31 warming
67:31 / climate change lie lie lie lie lie
67:36 problem inserted reaction narrated
67:40 solution provided if this stuff wasn't
67:45 height I don't think well since they
67:48 coronavirus for one second if
67:50 coronavirus wasn't hyped if it wasn't
67:53 used to orchestrate a bouncing stock
67:56 market if it wasn't being this this fear
68:01 porn from the leftist media which is
68:05 virtually all of it even Fox got into a
68:09 little bit if that wasn't done president
68:13 Trump would have said nothing about it
68:14 and a couple months later he would have
68:17 done its thing few thousand people okay
68:20 so it's a bad thing you know if it
68:22 happens to anybody but it's what a blown
68:24 over we found three Chinese nationalists
68:29 infected with grown a virus trying to
68:31 cross the southern border oh really
68:35 suffering from fevers and all kinds of
68:38 stuff so they're down there trying to
68:39 cross into our country to do what do you
68:42 think the spread the [ __ ] [ __ ] is
68:46 what they were trying to do why because
68:48 we took preventive measures to not let
68:50 them fly here I mean seriously if you
68:53 want it in the United States and you're
68:55 just a Chinese national all right well
68:58 in your sick he priced a New Mexico rent
69:00 a hotel room
69:02 meet your vegetables and drink your
69:03 lemon juice and take your antibiotics or
69:05 it's a virus won't help you out but do
69:08 whatever you can do maybe take
69:09 antibiotics admit to free up your immune
69:10 system to kick a virus's ass take your
69:13 LAN or whatever then you cross over when
69:17 you actually have some health in you but
69:21 nope they did it so they could infect us
69:23 a little bit more nefarious intentions
69:26 from a communist country that is
69:28 butthurt because the scam that has been
69:33 perpetrated on the American people has
69:35 finally come to an end
69:38 hmm I think it's it still utterly
69:42 fascinates me I'm gonna repeat this a
69:44 few times in episodes because it's just
69:46 not me as far as I know there's only two
69:50 countries in the entire world trying to
69:52 hang on to communist socialism China and
69:56 North Korea and hey you know I they can
70:02 do whatever they want in their a little
70:03 petri dish but don't bring that [ __ ] or
70:05 anywhere else in the world it doesn't
70:06 want it right it'd be easy for Americans
70:10 I guess I mean theoretically speaking
70:12 for us to say nope this stuff can't
70:14 exist anywhere on planet Earth and even
70:16 one still has it we're gonna sabotage
70:17 them we're gonna forbid any trade with
70:19 them we're gonna sanction then we're
70:21 gonna put [ __ ] all of our military
70:23 around their country they're not gonna
70:24 be able to do anything but no we don't
70:26 even do that we're like you just keep
70:27 your little thing over there but the
70:30 idea that these two countries one
70:34 subsidized by the other is hanging on I
70:38 will seek North Korea's got a different
70:39 spin on things which I guess I'll say a
70:42 little bit about that because he's a
70:43 fear porn platform as well and he's
70:46 trying to unfair porn in his world but
70:49 when the entire world is away from this
70:52 methodology but they've all tried it in
70:54 some form or fashion besides America
70:56 which was founded after these monarchs
70:57 tried that stuff Russia even got out of
71:00 it Russia's completely capitalistic
71:02 country doesn't matter what's on the
71:04 wall doesn't matter what anyone says
71:05 they're a full-blown capitalistic
71:07 country again
71:09 Moscow looks like weird neo drive men on
71:11 crack they have more exotic car it looks
71:15 like
71:15 by the more exotic cars and business
71:19 deals going down it's still rough and
71:20 tough over there but it's least it's
71:22 going out with some ice on everyone's
71:24 fingers right and I'm not into all that
71:27 stuff but you know it's better than in
71:29 communism so North Korea is said to have
71:34 nuclear weapons which they do not I
71:37 assure you I assure you they have no
71:40 nuclear weapons if at any point in time
71:42 is from the recording of this episode
71:46 which is March 4th 2020 they come up
71:49 with a nuclear weapon that some
71:50 inspectors go over there and you see if
71:51 documentary filming it
71:53 that should arrived yesterday probably
71:57 from China or from some intelligence
71:59 agency to try to prop up the fact that
72:01 they had it now above ground testing has
72:04 been banned since 1973 globally so kim
72:08 jeong-hoon
72:09 or is it kim jong ill in general if he
72:14 had done above ground test he would be
72:18 in violation of international law but
72:20 then again he does that all the time but
72:23 a big bomb would have really sent home
72:26 the message to the rest of the world
72:27 look we got that don't [ __ ] with us
72:29 right and his people would be like
72:31 unbelievably confident and their leader
72:37 below ground tests well they're very
72:39 very self evidence when you do it when
72:43 India said they had a nuclear weapon you
72:45 saw the below ground tests now can be
72:48 done with TNT and other explosives to
72:50 give the same visual effect at least
72:52 they gave you some video right but I've
72:56 been watching I probably seen about 10
73:01 North Korean videos from all different
73:03 sources right from the super cynical
73:05 [ __ ] to go over there just you know
73:08 here's what here's what rubs me weird
73:12 with the videos that are up North Korea
73:14 because they get in of course they have
73:15 these monitors that watch them
73:17 constantly they have to go on a
73:18 state-sponsored tour and there's a lot
73:20 of guys you know using their cell phones
73:21 illegally filming out the windows and
73:24 they do manage to smuggle out a lot of
73:26 footage of areas that are
73:28 you know far from Pyongyang
73:31 but that they will go to a statue a
73:35 bronze statue of the grandfather and the
73:38 his son which is the current leaders
73:41 father and they're like some of the most
73:43 beautiful statues ever created on this
73:46 planet and they can't say one thing nice
73:48 about it
73:49 murals that are amazingly painted can't
73:51 say any nice about it's just it's all
73:53 gotta be turned into some it's an axis
73:56 of evil nothing this can't be good like
73:59 nothing can be good if it looks bad they
74:01 think it's it's ever it looks good they
74:03 try to spend it like it's bad now is the
74:07 capital city way different than the rest
74:08 of the country yeah I'm willing to bet I
74:11 went all over Google Maps about two
74:14 weeks ago and literally just scoured
74:16 that country and all their satellite
74:18 footage looked at all the neighborhoods
74:20 now the video the footage that we get is
74:22 not incredibly detailed like you can't
74:25 get the three-dimensional readouts on
74:28 the buildings like you can for San
74:30 Francisco or Los Angeles at Paris but
74:32 it's you can see if they have a pool in
74:34 the back you can see human beings
74:35 walking so the sound of the footage is
74:37 pretty amazing but now how did he spend
74:40 communism a little bit different the
74:41 grandfather which I think his name's Ken
74:44 Jones sill right his big thing was to
74:50 you know the creepy thing is that he
74:53 made himself a god I don't know how
74:56 sophisticated his culture was before he
74:58 decided to do that little change of
75:01 route maybe he felt like that was what
75:03 they needed they needed their own Jesus
75:05 Christ in fact they even asked a woman
75:06 about you know how do you really view
75:11 your leaders in an association with your
75:15 life and she said well it's kind of like
75:16 European Europe's Jesus except our
75:20 leaders are part of our family so no but
75:25 because they all have the picture in
75:26 their homes
75:26 the adults by law have to wear at least
75:28 the first two leaders on there on a
75:31 pendant over their heart
75:34 now they do you know they go on and on
75:37 about how America is their enemy I mean
75:39 it is truly the game they
75:41 I asked one of these soldiers at the DMZ
75:43 in the modern age in this last year here
75:45 you know what did you think when you
75:47 first saw an American soldier at on the
75:50 South Korean side and he said well you
75:54 know they're my sworn enemy and he goes
75:56 okay well tell me some more about what
75:58 you feel that way me as well because I'm
76:01 looking at South Korea right now it
76:03 should be a part of North Korea and
76:04 we're split apart from each other and
76:07 were enemies now because of what the
76:09 white man did to us you know the
76:10 Americans did to us because we have to
76:13 live with that every single day you
76:14 don't have someone that split your
76:15 North's from your south and if they had
76:17 and you know that the south is made of
76:20 the same DNA roughly and there's this
76:22 propaganda that keeps you hating each
76:24 other would that piss you off and if you
76:26 knew where the country was that did it
76:28 when she can mad at them and I was like
76:29 that's pretty good right I mean he's
76:31 telling his perspective you got to
76:33 respect that right but all there um you
76:38 know I put this way if you just watch
76:39 one North Korean documentary like I did
76:44 I mean I almost geez I've seen again
76:46 like I've watched probably three in the
76:47 last week here you'll hear the
76:51 propaganda and you'll get that weird
76:53 feeling but it takes a while to hear it
76:56 over and over and over again and start
76:58 to insert yourself into their culture
77:00 just a tiny bit because that's all we
77:01 can do from afar right and what they say
77:05 is essentially if you listen to their
77:07 Dogma or whatever propaganda we have
77:10 plenty of it over here too it's all
77:13 about the hive mentality of you're not
77:20 to do anything just for your own benefit
77:22 you're to do everything for every for
77:25 everyone else's benefit constantly right
77:29 now you might say well pun yang the
77:32 major city I'm placing a little bit
77:33 wrong but their capital city is like
77:37 flourishing it's got you know all kinds
77:39 of wild buildings and structures and
77:41 everyone's dressed in modern clothing
77:43 and education seems to be pretty decent
77:46 you know they're missing a ton of
77:47 amenities that we have over here as soon
77:49 as you leave the main city you start to
77:52 see commoners and there
77:55 funnily you know a lot of the children
77:56 like one in five kids have had stunted
77:58 growth I actually think the numbers
78:00 actually higher but they'll one of the
78:03 one of the most revered women that deals
78:07 with one of the biggest farming
78:09 community she's in multiple
78:10 documentaries as part of the stop and
78:13 she showed off her 14 year old kid in
78:16 one of the videos and he looks like he's
78:19 about ten size-wise and she made an
78:23 excuse of why he was smaller and what's
78:28 interesting is they had a famine in the
78:31 in the nineties when Russia fell
78:34 especially that wracked him really hard
78:38 right and it resulted in we don't know
78:41 how many deaths from starvation in this
78:44 smallest number is five hundred thousand
78:46 the highest numbers and the two million
78:47 range that I've ever heard and so this
78:52 kid is not born anywhere near the famine
78:55 he still has a stunted growth so he
78:58 still had food issues so why is it
79:01 because people will go we'll look the
79:03 capital city is way better than the rest
79:05 of the place so it's still a horrible
79:07 government stuff like that it's like I
79:09 don't know whether I was horrible not
79:10 you know what they're trying to do in my
79:14 opinion is save face with the rest of
79:17 the world and to prop up some form of
79:19 you know example to their own people
79:23 because you have to you have to work and
79:26 apply and get educated to get into the
79:28 main city to get any citizenship in the
79:30 main city and one of the documentaries I
79:32 saw that's exactly what occurred their
79:36 leader the current dude um he brought a
79:39 family into the major city and gave him
79:42 apartment and to them it was like the
79:45 rest of their life is done now and what
79:48 was very interesting was a very old
79:50 couple who had a young kid you know what
79:54 I need in this world is different than
79:55 what you need in this world you know
79:58 that right away that's a psychological
80:01 comparison between the two of us if you
80:04 go up one layer there's a sociological
80:06 comparison to
80:08 what China needs is different than what
80:09 what Chinese people as a nation need is
80:11 different than what the United States
80:13 needs when I do see these videos of
80:18 North Korea this seemed to be in many
80:21 respects endearingly locked in the 50s I
80:25 mean the buildings the signage the cars
80:28 their military alone is just in the 50s
80:31 unless they bought something off China
80:32 which you can see a drastic difference
80:34 in those things their clothing in a lot
80:38 of cases is still in the 50s when you
80:42 see them completely outfitted in their
80:45 ponying you know attire there's
80:52 something very interesting about and you
80:55 see that they are starving here and
81:00 there which is a bad thing no doubt
81:03 they're under communistic rule that's a
81:07 bad thing in our opinion right okay but
81:12 what don't they have they don't have
81:15 tmz.com they don't have porn they don't
81:21 have you know I mean who knows what the
81:25 privileged are able to pull off but they
81:28 do think about helping each other up to
81:31 a point right again the other
81:34 documentary I told you about in the
81:35 previous episode is you know once you
81:38 become so broke and starving you no
81:40 longer give a [ __ ] about anything but
81:41 eating and so I'm sure there's pockets
81:44 of that as well they have these
81:47 concentration camps okay work camps
81:50 they're bona fide real things that
81:54 whether or not they're still active
81:56 right now don't know if you did talk
81:58 against the state that's where you go
82:00 you pound rocks
82:01 you really do literally work in horrible
82:04 conditions I'm sure that there's
82:06 torturing and all kinds of stuff if you
82:08 go against the communistic country
82:09 that's the problem with that form of
82:11 government
82:12 China is rumored to have the same
82:13 problem and China actually starts
82:15 harvesting organs off prisoners killing
82:19 them and selling off everything to make
82:21 a buck
82:21 all right we don't need to fear anything
82:26 of North Korea in terms of their nuclear
82:29 arsenal Trump went over there and got
82:32 things settled one thing they're showing
82:34 on national television North Korea is
82:36 Kim Jong Un's shaking the hand of the
82:38 president of South Korea on their TV as
82:41 a moment of unification to their people
82:46 it's phenomenal
82:48 I'm sure him shaking hands with Trump's
82:50 been on TV too now they'll um you know
82:56 brag here and there you know
83:01 Pompeyo through the State Department
83:03 signed a deal with the Taliban to sort
83:05 of in the conflict over there thus
83:07 allowing Trump to pull of our troops out
83:08 can't have a conflict with the Taliban
83:10 if we're not there right now I don't
83:13 always do with these military bases I
83:14 don't know where that deal is going but
83:16 RT the Russian news organization tried
83:20 to run a slander article saying that
83:22 this is gonna fall apart because Trump
83:24 was taking credit for this at a speech
83:27 well that's absurd
83:29 don't you think a Taliban guy on their
83:32 end is taking credit for his half of the
83:34 in negotiations of course he is
83:37 Kim jong-un knows how he is perceived by
83:41 his people we don't know how he's being
83:43 perceived by his people so how he talks
83:45 to his people about the deal with Trump
83:48 he has got to I mean he think about this
83:52 man for 70 years they just had their
83:54 70th anniversary over there few years
83:57 back okay they have been telling every
84:00 single citizen in North Korea that
84:02 America is their arch enemy and now all
84:05 the sudden Donald Trump goes over there
84:07 and shakes his hand at the DMZ on the
84:09 North Korean side okay so you're uh
84:13 you're gonna have to undo seventy years
84:14 of propaganda and Americans are like so
84:17 naive that we're like oh well of course
84:19 he's just gonna go over there and say
84:21 hey it's all over we're gonna shake
84:22 hands again and it's just gonna be like
84:24 completely hunky-dory of course not if
84:28 anything imagine you are myself sitting
84:31 down with Kim jumbo
84:33 and he's interested in how we can work
84:36 together between your country and his
84:39 country write me in the united states
84:41 and you wherever you're from now if
84:44 you're marginally intelligent which
84:47 everyone on this channel is far beyond
84:49 marginally intelligent we know right
84:51 away that we wouldn't want a McDonald's
84:55 over there right we wouldn't want drugs
84:57 over there we wouldn't want porn over
84:59 there we wouldn't want celebrity worship
85:02 over there we wouldn't want that for
85:04 them because they don't have it yet and
85:06 there's nothing we're gaining from it
85:08 over here think about the political
85:10 climate right now what they are Kett
85:13 broad coming out and bill mark on us and
85:15 they want the economy to crash to get
85:17 rid of Trump people who are millionaires
85:20 saying they want the economy to crash I
85:23 don't know I don't know what to do with
85:25 these people right I know it's a free
85:27 country but goddamn they're wishing harm
85:29 on people who are trying to make
85:31 something better of their life right
85:33 I know females in in LA that will
85:37 probably pull out a gun and shoot Bill
85:38 Maher right in his [ __ ] face if they
85:40 lose their businesses after he said that
85:42 you know because they'll be so furious
85:45 still their whole life's will come to a
85:47 complete end you know this is you and
85:52 the dudes are a little bit more like if
85:53 whatever he's an [ __ ] you know so if
85:57 you're gonna do negotiation with North
85:58 Korea you're gonna keep it like okay
86:00 what what do you need the most I think
86:01 what you need the most is food and
86:04 energy let's work on that we have a
86:07 bunch of great power plant schematics
86:08 that are pretty much public domain where
86:10 we come from when we put one in your
86:12 backyard you control it you build it
86:14 your people build it if you don't want
86:18 any you know Caucasian guys to build it
86:21 well you want you to hire some labor out
86:22 of China to build it whatever you gotta
86:23 do South Korea whatever we'll find some
86:26 people you can trust in the book but you
86:27 guys could probably do it yourself
86:29 okay so famine is over power drops are
86:33 over right all right now they want to
86:37 build up tourism in North Korea okay
86:41 think about it right you got this Truman
86:44 Show in a bubble which is North Korea
86:46 right
86:47 and if you import a bunch of tourism in
86:49 there well you're gonna also bring the
86:51 cultural input over there imagine
86:55 someone bringing an iPad full of porn
86:56 imagine you know all these punk-ass rich
87:00 kids over there treating the people
87:02 treating the locals like slaves right
87:04 because this happens all over the place
87:06 from Costa Rica to the Bahamas to
87:08 Jamaica to any place we have the United
87:11 States I don't know about Europe you
87:12 tell me with some of these rich kids are
87:15 absolutely the most acidic human beings
87:16 on planets we can't even stand them in
87:18 our own country just some of them just a
87:20 few of them right but all it takes is a
87:22 few bad apples to completely corrupt
87:24 their vision of us and then all of a
87:26 sudden they're like close the borders
87:27 man we don't want these people in here
87:29 and you know Kim Jong Lee was like why
87:32 one of them rape one of our women and
87:34 the other one you know beat a guy up
87:36 because he wouldn't get him a drink or
87:38 whatever right so back on the subject
87:44 just to wrap it up I don't know what to
87:46 tell you guys and I in GAO's about the
87:50 fear porn thing other than to say
87:53 anytime something comes at you through
87:55 official arteries okay especially you
87:57 know official narrative arteries
88:00 do your best to resist their imprint on
88:04 your personality and on your fight or
88:07 flight system for instance you hear a
88:11 bunch of reports that corner virus goes
88:13 crazy me you know you can quietly not
88:18 shake as many hands and not spend as
88:20 much time and public if you're a little
88:22 bit concerned that's kind of what I did
88:23 at first
88:24 well because I'll sing karaoke air once
88:27 wha and I live in a very mixed culture
88:30 area where you know we have a huge Asian
88:32 community at two or three different
88:33 Asian communities in our local area from
88:36 Vietnamese communities to Chinese
88:38 communities and so you know who knows
88:41 came who knows who came off a boat from
88:43 China before this whole thing rolled out
88:45 right and maybe they got it you know its
88:48 two-week gestation period you know sigh
88:49 just pull back a little bit I sing in a
88:51 different place that is a little bit
88:53 more I know everyone you know and so but
88:59 give it some time
89:01 typically the archetype is the more that
89:03 they tell you to panic there's less of a
89:06 reason to panic but now there's a flip
89:09 side to the coin which is why I kind of
89:12 have to be like I've been saying in
89:14 several episodes if you're a protector
89:16 of your family had a buddy call me
89:18 because he was like you know he works in
89:20 a sanitation for his town so he was
89:24 asking me some very basic health
89:26 questions about boosting his immunity as
89:28 a result of just doing his job and he
89:30 knows everything that I say you want to
89:32 know if there's anything else I suggest
89:33 but then he just kind of threw on the
89:35 Barbie of the conversation the Carano
89:36 Bioversity it wasn't terribly concerned
89:38 about it but so the thing I told him was
89:42 I said look you're you're a real man
89:46 you're a chieftain you're an alpha so
89:49 you know you're he's got two daughters
89:51 and a wife and so he is because he's
89:54 kind of been trying to take inventory
89:58 not even panicking but just taking
89:59 inventory of the situation trying to
90:01 find out as much as he can as quickly as
90:02 he can and luck thank God he's in the
90:04 Midwest in America so he is absolutely a
90:06 no he's going to be like the tiniest
90:10 infinitesimal percentage of exposure I
90:13 told him I said look you're just doing
90:17 what you do you're doing with grown men
90:19 do and grown women do you protect your
90:21 own but a man's got that times ten of a
90:25 woman and I don't mean two women have it
90:27 strong you're women you have to
90:29 understand man we're here to throw
90:30 ourselves for in front of a bus so you
90:32 don't get hit you know we're here to die
90:34 for the family you know we're here to
90:36 protect you guys and our goal isn't to
90:37 die at all our goal is to keep everyone
90:39 healthy right so when I kind of reminded
90:41 him of that he was like you know what
90:42 you're right you know that's what I'm
90:44 doing
90:45 I'm just doing the chief didn't think
90:47 protecting my people not just my own
90:49 family but his whole town you know and
90:51 so he's very clever and very brilliant
90:54 he's got some really cool things he's
90:56 going to kind of smuggle in some really
90:58 good habits into his some reports that
91:02 he has some associates of his and so
91:04 very cool but so you maybe like him
91:08 where you're just protecting you're just
91:12 taking in information
91:14 and it's like if you know I'll give you
91:16 a weird analogy that I've been in a
91:18 couple times in my lifetime maybe some
91:20 of you have - I'll give you a real-life
91:22 situation that happened to me in Oxnard
91:26 California probably 1990 my girlfriend
91:30 and I were working in the same company
91:32 and we went to lunch and we got done
91:36 with lunch and we're trying to drive
91:37 back home and we pull out all these
91:40 beach communities it's right up against
91:41 the beach you know you have four or five
91:43 different roads here and there and some
91:45 guy was in an old car I think it was an
91:47 old challenger all jacked up a big-ass
91:50 tires it wasn't I was like a Chevelle or
91:51 something and I don't know what was
91:54 going on with this guy but he had a
91:57 big-ass monster engine in this thing and
91:59 he had I think accidentally bumped a
92:02 curb or something and got angry and so
92:05 he floored his car he's in front of us
92:07 about it know the football field or so
92:11 and he starts spinning and he is
92:14 spinning fast like crazy abnormal fast
92:18 like this engine must have been some
92:19 big-ass 429 or something blown I don't
92:22 know what it was but she's driving and
92:26 she's from New York so she wasn't you
92:28 know a layperson and she just goes what
92:31 do i do what do I do
92:32 I no idea was I just said stop just see
92:36 where he goes
92:36 you try to get past him you're gonna
92:38 he's gonna run into you just were safe
92:41 distance to stop and sure enough this
92:44 guy he's on our lane coming but half the
92:46 time he's coming at us right and so
92:48 eventually blew it out of his system we
92:52 couldn't figure out he was angry or he
92:54 was just trying to do donuts but because
92:55 I think he bumped a curb and he got
92:57 upset so he so he just turns around
93:01 drives off and we just drove home no big
93:04 deal had we panicked who the hell knows
93:08 what would have happened so don't panic
93:11 give yourself some time again really
93:15 stop and assess where you're getting
93:16 your fear from there's a completely
93:19 homegrown fear well make sure that
93:21 that's also something that is real
93:24 because you can panic stuff into
93:26 existence
93:27 shouldn't and so don't do that we're
93:31 trying to always maintain the control
93:33 that we have manifested so far so keep
93:36 it keep your control trust your genetics
93:40 if you do have reason to go into the
93:43 fear state do you know what you can deal
93:45 with really horrible situations and
93:47 never be afraid you can just be
93:51 disappointed that you're having to go
93:53 through it you know I get on planes when
93:57 I fly and everyone has to assess what
94:02 they think about dying in a plane that's
94:04 the safest way to travel on planet Earth
94:06 okay but I've kind of come I mean who
94:09 knows exactly how this would happen so
94:11 I'm you know I'm not trying to sound
94:12 arrogant in this situation but I will
94:14 tell you that if the plane starts to go
94:15 down what's gonna happen for me is I
94:19 will definitely feel all those
94:20 butterflies and all those sort of you
94:23 know instant shocks to my system my
94:26 muscles are going to tense up but I know
94:30 that I am absolutely relegated to the
94:34 pilots capabilities to the planes
94:36 capabilities there's nothing I can do me
94:38 and I'm not in control
94:39 maybe if I super duper believed in you
94:43 know manifest destiny I could strong on
94:45 the plane onto the ground maybe I'll try
94:47 that but in terms of being you know in
94:51 fear porn mm-hmm I don't know I think
94:54 I'll just be alarmed and I'll be
94:57 disappointed if I die in the thing like
94:59 [ __ ] I don't know that's just how I go
95:01 then right but you know some folks the
95:04 second that the plane shakes they're
95:06 screaming they're maybe they stopped and
95:09 they just let out one big screen but
95:10 then they're in a state of they don't
95:12 even know where they are we don't want
95:14 to be those people I think you feel me
95:18 anyway hope you thought this was useful
95:21 for you it's just good stuff to remember
95:23 man I try to put tons of tidbits in
95:25 there so that you can repeat things if
95:27 you believe them that are valuable but
