00:00 [Music]
00:33 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:35 gentlemen if this episode works it's
00:39 it's meant to be left my power supply up
00:44 my smoke lounge for the PC which I've
00:48 been using for last several episodes and
00:53 so I'm running on the old Mac as a
00:54 backup here so I've had this dream
00:57 episode brewing and I couldn't quite put
01:04 my finger on it
01:04 I still have elements that may or may
01:07 not be covered in this episode but I'm
01:11 calling this one dream development and
01:14 the purpose of this episode is to
01:16 discuss with those of you who dream a
01:21 little exercise that you might find
01:24 valuable you're probably already doing
01:25 it but since no one ever talks about
01:28 dreams really besides hokey [ __ ]
01:31 about what they mean right we're gonna
01:34 get into it so what do I mean by dream
01:36 development what I am referencing is the
01:43 daily amalgamation of everything you
01:47 learn from previous dreams so you have a
01:51 dream and you wake up and if you're like
01:55 most of us when you're first
01:56 experiencing this or you know maybe
01:58 you've done this your whole life it's
01:59 just sort of this little fun thing that
02:01 happens the only remember like up a
02:03 thimble of the dream typically and then
02:06 you go on about your day you go on about
02:08 your life but the more you analyze your
02:13 dreams what
02:13 you figure out is that if you stack up
02:16 little lessons that you learn you must
02:18 be observant in your dream
02:20 especially when you wake up to realize
02:24 what's happening how much of your senses
02:26 were you using what did you see
02:28 what did that mean to you personally did
02:31 anything from the outside world affect
02:32 your dream are you in one of those
02:34 frequencies or are you simply having a
02:37 dream that is beautifully free-formed
02:40 maybe it uses some of your real life
02:42 people that you know most of you like me
02:46 will have dream people they feel
02:49 familiar to you but you don't know who
02:52 they are they seldom ever have names
02:55 that's the interesting thing you seldom
02:57 go what's your name you know and it's
02:58 like it's Joe Oh eight Joe and then you
03:00 spend the rest of the dream hey Joe
03:02 what's up you don't bother with it you
03:05 just feel comfortable enough that you're
03:07 in your own world and when you're in
03:08 your dreams typically you will feel as
03:10 if you were in command of your dreams
03:13 perhaps not like General Patton but you
03:15 will feel that you are obviously the
03:19 center of attention nothing exists in
03:22 the world without you being in that
03:24 world because that's obviously the way
03:27 it works right what I am discovering by
03:33 waking up every single day and studying
03:36 my dreams is that they get bigger they
03:42 get longer it's easier to remember them
03:46 it just becomes a function of your being
03:49 my dreams are becoming so intense and so
03:53 I don't know it's starting to get into a
03:56 $0.05 situation I'm not gaining anymore
04:00 necessarily command over my body within
04:02 a dream so all the instrumentality
04:04 issues I've been mentioning in previous
04:05 dream episodes are still true meaning
04:07 you know my body is more of a figment of
04:10 my imagination within a dream but I'm
04:11 definitely feeling things I have
04:14 confirmed in the last I would say seven
04:17 days that people are touching me and I'm
04:19 feeling it that's a profound increase in
04:23 sensory input from previous dreams that
04:26 I've had
04:27 I do have a few dreams where things
04:30 touched me and I think I felt them but I
04:34 would say that that mysteries not been
04:35 solved recently when I wake up
04:38 regardless if I have had four hours of
04:42 sleep or ten hours of sleep
04:44 I am so involved with the dream world
04:48 so enveloped by it that it is like being
04:52 birthed out of a canal and what do I
04:56 mean by that obviously that's a metaphor
04:58 when I wake up I have to push myself out
05:04 of that world because even though I am
05:06 awake in this reality which I believe we
05:08 are sharing it's as if I am in sort of a
05:13 warm soup a thick thick soup of reality
05:21 that is still hanging on to me almost as
05:25 if I had to come up for air and then I
05:28 have to push out I have found that
05:32 various activities will push me out but
05:34 I can still get up and go the restroom
05:35 as long as I don't subscribe to this
05:40 reality that much and get back into bed
05:42 go right back into the same dream I
05:44 continue my reality till it's time to
05:49 wake up but when it's time to wake up I
05:51 have to engage in various rituals and
05:53 there's it's a fascinating thing that I
05:56 have found that gets me awake and one of
05:58 its turning the lights on turning lights
06:02 on is over 50% of the process for me to
06:05 shake out the reality that I just had
06:08 inside my dreams but now as long as
06:11 you're not having nightmares I hope that
06:14 none of you do you're typically having
06:17 fairly soothing experiences regardless
06:20 of how figurative they are or how
06:21 specific they are you're essentially
06:24 changing the operating system of your
06:26 soul you might be dreaming in Windows
06:31 and you come out into McIntosh or the
06:32 vice versa alien software one alien
06:36 software to
06:40 reason I find that light is so
06:44 infectious for the mind in this reality
06:46 that it really penetrates and what's
06:48 weird about it is even though you know
06:51 you'll wake up and the Sun's up shining
06:54 through your window
06:56 it still doesn't get you up maybe some
06:59 of you sleep you know with your windows
07:01 unobstructed I have blinds but the
07:03 blinds they just didn't the light a
07:05 little bit engaging your mind using your
07:09 phone maybe an iPad that's pretty good
07:13 but you can slip right back in you might
07:16 lose track of your previous storyline
07:19 getting up and sitting up getting up and
07:22 standing up obviously if you wake up to
07:25 a phone call you can shake yourself out
07:27 pretty darn quick but I'm talking about
07:30 when you have complete control over
07:31 yourself
07:33 it gets fascinating but developing your
07:37 dreams and dream development in general
07:40 I think has more side effects than meets
07:44 the eye if you sat down and said hey
07:46 everyone let's let's get together it's
07:48 10 of us in a room we say look let's
07:50 some do what we can to log our dreams to
07:52 figure out again all these five senses
07:55 whether or not we're engaging certain
07:57 ones obviously most of us have sight and
07:59 sound in our dreams
08:00 do we have touch we could write all that
08:04 down but let me throw you a paradigm
08:07 shift mechanism in your brain if you
08:11 believe that this reality that we're in
08:13 watching YouTube is the reality it is
08:15 the definitive reality that exists and
08:18 everything else is just imaginative when
08:21 you come out of your dreams and get back
08:23 in this reality it will absolutely
08:26 override the other one it's almost as if
08:29 they're jealous cousins of each other
08:31 right one tries to erase the other you
08:35 do remember this reality when you're in
08:37 a dream I had another dream the other
08:39 day with Prince I was at a studio I was
08:42 at a sari I wasn't a student I was at
08:44 his house which is kind of a studio and
08:46 there's friends of his and friends of
08:47 mine and he's jiving me and he's making
08:50 me go through his record collection to
08:52 pick out a song I've never heard before
08:53 and he's gonna
08:55 but he's really being playful with me
08:58 like a friend I'm in my clothes he's in
09:02 his clothes you know he's crazy prints
09:04 clothes I don't sit around thinking
09:07 about prints you know I mean I I do here
09:09 and I got four or five paintings I've
09:10 done to him in the house but I don't sit
09:14 and worship Him I don't play his music
09:15 every single day and cry but for some
09:18 reason the dudes on my mind he makes it
09:22 into my dreams it's very interesting but
09:25 there's one thing I've noticed by not
09:28 having such a bias for this reality
09:30 because you can see on this show if you
09:32 watch all the dream episodes go to the
09:33 playlist in YouTube and just hit it if
09:36 you want to see it in on the Ute on the
09:38 sorry the deep thoughts radio.com
09:40 there's key word categories that
09:42 everything's in and dream is one of them
09:44 so you can listen to them all and
09:45 podcast if you want but instead of
09:48 adopting this reality is the reality
09:50 what we've been doing and these episodes
09:51 is starting to say okay wait wait wait
09:54 what is reality right we've got plenty
09:56 of odds on that subject matter dreams
10:00 happen in dreams and sleep are forced
10:03 upon us at least sleep is I've been
10:07 doing the show for three years this
10:09 month and so in a short three-year
10:14 period if lightly you know analyzing my
10:18 dreams and then very seriously analyzing
10:22 my dreams and analyzing it on a level of
10:24 wait maybe my own assumptions about this
10:28 reality are I wouldn't say wrong but two
10:34 to definitive I'm in this reality that's
10:38 just it boy this is the real one hmm
10:42 what's interesting is is imagine you
10:44 were neo and the matrix the movie The
10:47 Matrix 1999 screw those sequels right
10:49 the way the movie works is that he's you
10:52 know he's visited at his apartment and
10:56 the chick was name escapes me the
10:59 character's name escapes me she comes
11:02 and gets him and you know says look
11:04 you're the one right you're neo you're
11:06 the hacker I think that's what he was
11:08 and he's kind of playing coy with her
11:10 and that eventually he gets pulled out
11:12 of the matrix and we get to see that
11:14 he's been in this alternate computer
11:16 reality he is a human battery in all
11:20 this all this abrupt change to his life
11:23 but now let's go back and rewrite the
11:25 first scene first half of the first act
11:28 let's make it an act long so instead of
11:31 I don't know 10 minutes where he gets
11:34 pulled out he spends 30 minutes getting
11:36 pulled out and he goes back and he goes
11:38 forth he's able to kind of wake up in
11:41 his pod he isn't quite pulled out yet
11:43 and he gets put back in the matrix and
11:45 he kind of goes back and forth what
11:48 would have happened to his perception of
11:49 reality had he seen that he was having a
11:51 full five since reality in a virtual
11:53 world and then wakes up in one as well
11:57 I'm going to say that he would be in the
12:00 matrix itself starting to have what he
12:04 ended up having at the end of the movie
12:05 which is this realization that he is in
12:07 a equally made-up reality of course in
12:10 the movie they invert the what is real
12:13 and what isn't real right but let's just
12:16 say both of these things are equally
12:18 simulated in our brains
12:20 it's the paradigm we adopted as a child
12:24 one reality we have strict rules mmm at
12:28 least I think we do like I said mentally
12:32 insane people don't just fly around the
12:34 world they don't lift 10,000 pound cars
12:37 just because they're crazy so either
12:39 we're imposing those rules on all things
12:42 or it's simply not possible within this
12:44 domain if our soul is truly our identity
12:48 and it is the thing that is free and it
12:51 can adopt different realities and go
12:52 between worlds and that might explain a
12:55 lot of things okay you know a lot of us
12:58 struggle from time to time with this
13:00 world you get challenged and depending
13:04 on how old you are and what you're
13:05 dealing with it could be really really
13:06 tough
13:07 some people take themselves out of this
13:09 world because it gets so tough right but
13:13 now what if you started to realize
13:16 there's a much bigger thing happening
13:18 here
13:19 a much bigger game being played this is
13:23 merely a reality that it's just as just
13:25 as incidental to your existence your
13:29 everlasting existence the soul that
13:31 cannot hide in the universe therefore
13:32 not it cannot perish in the universe
13:35 nothing can affect it so it can't be
13:38 undone unlike our vessels which return
13:41 back to the soil the soul is infinite in
13:45 all dimensions well then maybe this
13:48 reality starts relaxing a little bit in
13:50 your mind yeah this is just this journey
13:54 so sometimes it's tough sometimes it's
13:57 not sometimes you're on level one
13:59 sometimes you're on level ten if this
14:02 was a video gaming you knew it and you
14:06 liked playing video games which is
14:08 essentially having a challenge having a
14:11 paradigm of existence and you instead of
14:14 sleeping and going into dream mode you
14:16 slept and you pulled out into the I
14:20 don't know the game room with everyone
14:23 else and you start looking around you
14:24 start seeing you know thousands of
14:26 people in some warehouse with their
14:27 heads down inside this thing or whatever
14:29 form we have in the other world let's
14:32 just stick with another body and then
14:35 you pull out and you know you're like
14:37 whoa gosh that was really exhausting and
14:41 someone walks up to you maybe a robot
14:43 gives you something to drink how are you
14:45 doing mister so-and-so mrs. so-and-so do
14:48 you need anything else would you like to
14:49 go to your room you're like yeah sure
14:52 and they say well you know you're you're
14:55 gonna experience some disorientation
14:56 you're gonna get to remember back here
14:58 in the next minute just relax and it's
15:01 fully cool world so you're like man okay
15:03 I'm cool
15:04 I don't feel painful you start to just
15:08 like a dream when you wake up you start
15:09 to forget everything you were just doing
15:11 and you go and you relax and you can
15:14 spend as much time as you want on the
15:15 outside and you can come back into the
15:17 game it just takes over right where it
15:18 left off you could be driving down the
15:20 highway and pop out of that thing you
15:23 could always hit your head on the pillow
15:25 and pull out that way you never know
15:28 what I have found
15:31 by giving equal credence to the dream
15:34 world as this world is that your brain
15:37 starts to do different things with this
15:39 world as well as the other I haven't
15:44 quite flipped into lucid dreaming I've
15:46 done that's you know again like a
15:47 handful of times in my lifetime and
15:48 unfortunately I got so excited I woke up
15:50 pretty quickly I get about I'd say two
15:54 to five minutes if I'm lucky five is
15:57 probably longer than I've ever had but
16:00 you know what's time and a dream how do
16:03 you track it right but the one thing
16:06 I've noticed by acknowledging this
16:10 potential side reality is that I can
16:15 relax a lot more in this world you no
16:19 longer fear death I'll tell you that
16:21 much I haven't feared death for a very
16:22 long time if I ever did but now pause
16:26 that for a second because I have a new
16:27 thing I thought about making the whole
16:29 episode about this particular thing but
16:31 I don't think it would go for an entire
16:32 hour so this is sort of a research
16:35 update this is going to be an area for
16:39 commenting so perk up and listen and let
16:43 me know if you've had this experience
16:45 because I think it's also extremely
16:48 fascinating it could be a whole subject
16:50 matter to cover if we could sort of
16:53 Pierce it a little bit better when I lay
16:56 down there's two things I might talk
16:57 about one is the transition from sleep
17:01 or from being awake to being asleep and
17:04 one is this sort of instant history
17:09 thing that happens to me it's
17:13 fascinating when I lay down at night you
17:17 know your brains going a million miles
17:18 an hour
17:19 you could be you know I can be you know
17:23 sleeping for maybe the first five
17:25 minutes is if I am you know one
17:28 millisecond for meaning the deepest
17:30 sleep in the world and also in I wake
17:32 back up you know a little bit other
17:34 times I'm just churning on things you
17:36 know it's like I got this math problem
17:38 or something I'm trying to solves you
17:40 know some some problem I'm trying to
17:42 solve
17:44 but out of thin air what will happen is
17:47 that I will have a you have to track
17:52 that the chronology of this okay
17:57 instantaneously I will I will have one
18:00 of those moments of like oh my god I
18:02 forgot about this thing or I have done
18:04 something wrong or I have done something
18:07 wrong to someone feeling okay it's
18:10 probably a little strong in the last
18:11 example but I will imagine a tiny pocket
18:16 of linear time where something has gone
18:19 wrong and in that pocket of time like a
18:23 cartouche of time okay I will fantasize
18:28 into existence I use the word fantasize
18:31 as an inadvertent phrase in a full
18:34 history of something that never occurred
18:37 and it will be one of concern oh my god
18:41 I tell this person I would do this thing
18:43 for them as an example I can't remember
18:46 the last you know ones I've had but I
18:48 know this happens has happened to me for
18:50 years
18:52 and I start you know racing in my brain
18:55 to fix the problem within 30 is 60
18:59 seconds I realized that that thing never
19:03 happened
19:04 those people may or may not exist and
19:08 the whole thing was imagined within a
19:10 split second I imagined a false history
19:16 of a subject and I panic over it and
19:18 then I wake up I don't wake up wake up
19:21 but I just kind of pulled my head out
19:22 and go whoa where the hell'd that come
19:24 from it has happened to me so often that
19:29 when I start to study the mechanics of
19:31 the brain to have that occur to me it's
19:34 going to have to be occurring one of two
19:36 ways perhaps both but one of two ways
19:39 for sure I'm very careful biology for
19:42 sure either there's a chemical thing
19:46 that happens in the brain while it's
19:48 going to sleep they can architect this
19:51 utter feeling of long-term memory and
19:54 use the power of imagination which may
19:57 drive the dream machine to give me the
20:01 sense that there's a pocket of time that
20:03 something happened it is seldom a
20:07 pleasant thing maybe I'm having pleasant
20:10 ones because they're pleasant I think of
20:12 those as daydreams or night dreams or
20:13 sort of that Twilight Zone thing but
20:17 often times it has a little tiny smidgen
20:19 a panic in it
20:20 not not debilitating penny but you know
20:23 like oh my gosh that kind of feeling and
20:26 then I have in the last 10 years I would
20:29 say I've been catching it and I'll say
20:31 oh yeah that doesn't exist those people
20:36 don't exist and what's interesting is
20:37 once I acknowledge that it didn't exist
20:39 in my own mind to myself it vanishes
20:43 like a puff of smoke I no longer can
20:45 really track what I was thinking but it
20:47 happens my ulterior theory which is a
20:52 little more far-out but then again maybe
20:54 not maybe we all have that little phrase
20:57 get to us a little bit too much no
21:01 that's just great that's 10-4 hot stuff
21:02 and you run away from that right but
21:04 it's it's the truth sitting right in
21:05 front of you maybe it's our soul
21:10 reaching out into the universe and
21:12 either seeing something we have
21:13 experienced in a previous life or
21:14 different life different dimension or
21:16 we're seeing someone else's strain of
21:18 thought something is happening in the
21:21 neighborhood and you're simply sharing
21:24 their emotion for one second and then
21:26 you're realizing that's not me maybe
21:29 they're sharing yours maybe they're
21:30 panicking over what you are truly
21:32 debating in your mind which is based on
21:35 reality not sure it out happens right
21:38 but now let's take a combined look at
21:43 this whole thing and I hope that at
21:45 least one of you've had this experience
21:47 it's interesting we debate what time is
21:50 all the time right it's in my opinion
21:52 it's an illusion created by the storage
21:54 of past events and you know we can call
21:57 that time if we want the bucket of
21:58 things that happened to you your history
22:00 log of everything's happened to you I
22:02 was young and a lot smaller you know
22:04 some 35 years ago let's say 45 years ago
22:09 but if this reality is something that we
22:12 have a consensus on we created recreate
22:16 our history like I said maybe this is a
22:19 little tidbit like a playground for
22:22 those of you who program you know what
22:24 playgrounds are it's a little area where
22:26 you guys can test code and and you know
22:28 just see how commands work you're not
22:30 building an application you're just
22:31 learning out of code in this new
22:32 language these new commands it's a
22:34 playground perhaps this is just a little
22:37 playground for reality certainly dreams
22:41 are little playgrounds I call it the
22:46 student films of the gods what if I'm
22:50 just simply sensing a mechanism that's
22:53 involved with manifesting reality
22:57 because there's an overall consensus
22:59 that holds the physics that makes this
23:01 world occur
23:02 I can't overwhelm anything that's going
23:04 on here because there's too much
23:05 projection into the system perhaps this
23:09 is written by some outside force written
23:11 by us before we came here and it simply
23:13 follows these rules in a dream you
23:17 manifest reality you do you can panic in
23:20 a dream and all sudden you're in a
23:22 panicky situation the people places and
23:25 things have created themselves and
23:29 you're living in it obviously I'm not
23:33 having dreams about visiting Frank
23:35 Sinatra he's not in my era
23:37 I didn't worship that guy as a kid
23:39 Prince was so that's who I dragged into
23:42 the division what has always puzzled me
23:46 and I guess I shouldn't say puzzled but
23:48 something that I question is when you do
23:51 run into real people in your dreams are
23:56 they the real souls visiting you in your
23:59 dreams are they a manifestation that you
24:02 have I always thought you know sort of
24:05 like the Santa Claus story where he
24:08 visits everyone in a single night what
24:12 if you're Michael Jackson you have
24:15 probably conservatively speaking 2
24:19 billion fans and you die and you want to
24:23 comfort
24:23 all your fans your soul you can move
24:27 around time isn't really constraining
24:29 you anymore would it be possible as
24:32 Michael Jackson to visit the entire
24:34 world of people that would be concerned
24:37 comfort them spend as much time as you
24:40 want with each individual find some very
24:43 interesting fans and spend more time
24:44 with them maybe but the other thing
24:49 that's very interesting to go on to the
24:50 second topic here is that moment where
24:56 we go to sleep I've only tried and
24:59 succeeded one time without trying okay
25:02 to be conscious when the transition
25:07 occurs and boy tell me if you guys have
25:10 pulled this off before you are awake but
25:13 you're drifting you know you're within
25:16 seconds you're gonna go to sleep for
25:17 those of you go to sleep real fast
25:18 you're the candidates to really pull
25:20 this off and and if you dream but to see
25:24 your consciousness float into dream
25:27 state consciously such that when you
25:30 wake up you remember the experience I
25:32 have had this happen to me one time in
25:35 2015 my girlfriend I were going to bed
25:38 and like all couples in the first you
25:42 know fifteen to thirty minutes you sort
25:45 of spoon each other and cuddle and that
25:47 kind of thing and she was to my left and
25:50 we're hopping in bed and I went up
25:53 behind her and as soon as I got tucked
25:59 in behind her I'm staring you know like
26:01 a two inches from her the backside of
26:03 her back I felt myself thrust into dream
26:08 mode and the only thing I can say that
26:11 is visually remotely like it which is
26:13 really funny is that Tron Legacy when
26:18 Sam goes into the computer there's this
26:22 sort of I don't know pixel warping thing
26:24 that happens it's sort of like the you
26:26 know the Lightspeed thing happened in
26:29 Star Wars when I saw the film I didn't
26:32 like the transition at all I thought it
26:33 was such a waste of
26:35 the trance the sorry that you know the
26:38 transporting from outside world to
26:39 inside computer if you ever saw the
26:41 first movie in 82 they blew that thing
26:43 out it's one with the coolest scenes
26:45 when he's getting pulled into the
26:46 computer in here swimming in this tunnel
26:48 and then you go down to this planet
26:49 that's all pixelated with clouds and
26:51 stuff you know they couldn't do that
26:54 again of course cuz we need to modernize
26:55 it but just to have a big thrust of
26:57 pixels was like okay boring no
27:00 imagination
27:01 go figure Gen X but what was weird it
27:05 was exactly like that in my mind I swear
27:08 to God there was even a sound I kind of
27:13 a swishing weird sound that happened to
27:15 me I must have been utterly exhausted to
27:19 pull that off but why is that so
27:23 difficult to experience I was probably a
27:27 year into this show sorry no I just
27:30 started this show it was a year in Tim
27:32 kayler radio I think it's strange when
27:35 things like that are difficult you know
27:39 any of you've gone to a carnival and
27:40 you've tried to throw the Rings over the
27:42 thing or you try to hit the baseball's
27:43 against the targets that aren't really
27:45 there the ones that are moving with the
27:46 BB gun or whatever hey you don't do that
27:49 very often there's a trick to it you
27:51 know they got the odds stacked against
27:52 you of course they're making you do
27:53 something it's hard cuz they're gonna
27:54 give you a big stuffed animal if you
27:55 pull it off right but when you dream oh
27:58 I put this way and you go to sleep every
28:02 single night of your life - a couple
28:05 days of your whole life that you might
28:06 stay up 36 hours or whatever 48 hours
28:09 that's 365 days a year times how old you
28:12 are that's a lot of practicing folks and
28:16 think about it you wake back up maybe at
28:20 least once at night you go right back to
28:21 bed you go right back into dreaming if
28:25 you wake up and roll over at 3:00 a.m.
28:26 and you've been asleep since 10:00
28:28 you're gonna go right back to bed
28:30 usually unless you've been drinking so
28:34 why why can't this happen why is it the
28:38 dreams of the most shrouded things that
28:41 we don't talk about as if we've been
28:43 programmed not to talk about it like I
28:45 said in the previous episode like the
28:47 host looking at something not supposed
28:49 to look
28:49 in Westworld well it doesn't look like
28:51 anything to me right I think this is a
28:55 frontier and you know you have dream
28:59 clinics around the world god bless them
29:02 but they are looking at dreams from all
29:05 the research I've seen they're looking
29:07 at dreams on such a myopic technical
29:10 level it's almost like they're taking
29:12 the soul out of soul music you know it
29:16 was Al Jarreau the jazz singer
29:19 he said he once went to a university he
29:22 said he flew in on a private jet he gets
29:24 into a car he kind of see University
29:26 stands in front of these kids
29:27 and he's seeing one of his songs anyone
29:30 want to go dancing on the roof and he
29:33 said he's been a black college and so
29:35 expected to have a pretty soulful
29:36 performance from these people and he
29:37 said they sing it like a church choir
29:39 all stiff no soul no variant to the
29:44 attack and decay of the notes there's
29:46 nothing going on no one would ever dance
29:48 no one would ever feel a single thing
29:50 that he wrote into this song and he
29:51 stopped them and he said what the hell
29:52 are you doing this is jazz this has
29:57 feeling this is emotion this is why this
29:58 whole form of music was created it was
30:01 created by putting down the sheet music
30:02 and playing from your soul I feel like
30:07 that's a bit how the dream clinics work
30:09 on it when you get a book about all the
30:11 things that your dreams mean it's a
30:14 clinical breakdown of something that is
30:15 more dynamic than any book could ever
30:17 possibly document so why do that to
30:19 yourself why erase the freeform paradigm
30:23 when you can leave it open
30:25 I think dreams and jazz go together
30:28 don't they I've had an interesting
30:31 experience which is sort of hard to
30:33 describe and again a lot of opportunity
30:37 to comment here in case you've had a
30:38 similar experience it's going to sound a
30:40 little bit kooky but it's actually
30:45 pretty wonderful to experience you know
30:51 when you have a smell trigger your past
30:57 you know like or even a taste taste does
31:00 it to what I smell or taste
31:03 Newton's I go back to my past in the 70s
31:06 because that was a sort of a mainstay
31:08 treat of the grandparents that I had
31:12 there's a lot of things that'll do that
31:14 but that is one of them that just nails
31:15 me but there's certain weird smells that
31:19 I think were created out of whatever was
31:21 in the reality back then that I got that
31:23 I would get everyone so on I got it the
31:25 other day at a trade show I was smelling
31:28 this and I was like oh my god that said
31:30 smell it just took me back and I didn't
31:34 know exactly where it was but it was
31:36 definitely my childhood well I think I
31:39 can say safely what I have experienced
31:43 in probably the last I don't know I
31:46 would say them over the course of 20
31:49 years and I don't know if it goes back
31:50 to my beginning of my life but I notice
31:55 it now because of this show and
31:58 analyzing things so intensely especially
32:01 dreams I will be somewhere in the world
32:05 sometimes I'm driving my car sometimes
32:07 in my house often it will be in my car
32:10 and I think it's because of the sensory
32:12 input that I'm getting but I will see a
32:16 totally different world overlay over the
32:22 world that I am in what do I mean well
32:26 it's gonna be a little tough to describe
32:27 but I will say this I don't have any
32:29 feeling I don't have me sound it's all
32:32 sight this used to happen a lot when I
32:36 was drifting off to sleep but there it
32:40 will happen a certain lighting of a time
32:42 of day will trigger it certain times if
32:44 I'm driving my car at night sometimes it
32:46 happens it'll happen that day and I'll
32:47 see night but I have been seeing these
32:51 different versions of reality like this
32:57 world people structures cars it appears
33:03 to be future pretty intense feature I
33:08 would say potentially a hundred years in
33:10 the future it's really strange it only
33:13 happens for a few seconds I would say
33:16 but
33:17 it's almost as if I hit you with a flash
33:19 from an old camera right I pop you with
33:21 the flash and then you see the the
33:23 imprint of the flash and your eyeballs
33:24 right so I mean pops you with the
33:26 brights as they drive by so I will see
33:29 this and it's an absolute stunning
33:31 detail one of them I could say is if any
33:36 of you've seen sort of the Stanley
33:38 Kubrick's slash Steven Spielberg movie
33:41 ai the one that Kubrick was working on
33:43 when he passed away there's some pretty
33:45 fabulous worlds in that movie I saw one
33:49 the other day it's sort of between that
33:52 crazy reality which is like I don't know
33:56 300 years in the future down to today
33:59 somewhere in between things are clean
34:02 things are beautiful things are designed
34:05 amazing what I had thank when I think I
34:08 just saw I think within the last couple
34:10 days was one that was sort of a it was a
34:12 nighttime city scene and it was like a
34:16 diner or something at night
34:18 I'm sure this sort of thing exists
34:20 multiple places around the world but
34:22 this there's something about it that is
34:23 more advanced than this reality and
34:27 there's no flying cars or anything and
34:31 you know perhaps I am looking around the
34:32 plane anything like remote viewing or
34:34 something but it seems to be something
34:36 it comes with a lot more than just sight
34:40 the other sense that happens is a sense
34:43 of emotion of emotional context to that
34:46 world and the emotional context is
34:48 always the same it's a beautiful
34:51 balanced place I want to say it's earth
34:55 it could be earth definitely humans in
34:58 there I'm in there and I see myself as a
35:00 participant immediately like this is
35:02 where you were in this world this is
35:03 where you will be in this role or
35:05 whatever the hell this place is
35:06 sometimes they're sort of remote I don't
35:12 want to see desert communities because I
35:13 don't want you to think of sand dunes
35:15 and you know tents and things but it's
35:18 more of a kind of a rustic maybe
35:21 Australian location but it's very
35:24 developed the architectures sometimes
35:28 unbelievable and huge like
35:31 I used to get triggered when I was a kid
35:35 in probably in the 90s playing the
35:37 first-person shooter games where he
35:39 would have artists struggling to create
35:40 these worlds with very little processor
35:44 power so they would simply create a lot
35:45 of polygons worlds and you know they're
35:47 trying to make it reality but they'd say
35:49 it's like this is a whole cement city or
35:51 something like that and I would play the
35:52 game and I'd be triggered to go oh my
35:54 god there's there's another place that's
35:56 sort of like this it's interesting what
35:59 is interesting is is the more I undo
36:03 supply myself from this being the only
36:07 reality the more this is happening and
36:13 it never gets to a point where it's
36:14 dangerous right I'm not driving down the
36:16 highway and also I can't see reality and
36:18 I'm gonna wreck my car or anything like
36:19 that it's strictly an inner flash of a
36:23 reality and it usually feels wonderful a
36:25 lot of times I've been driving down from
36:27 Los Angeles back to Orange County and
36:30 there's certain places and usually dusk
36:33 is a really good trigger point for me
36:36 and I just start feeling like a highway
36:41 in this other world and they're all
36:44 different it's a thing and I want you to
36:45 think it's one place each is different
36:48 but it starts to turn into this
36:50 beautiful place and the sentiment of
36:52 this world is the following all of us
36:55 are working to a common good there are
36:58 no ruin ruling classes to screw with us
37:01 every single thing that is wrong with
37:03 this world is gone and it's not any type
37:06 of feeling of like oh gosh I really wish
37:08 you the world was like this and now I'm
37:09 having this vision now it's just
37:12 happening it's interesting I think it
37:16 has to do with dream development dream
37:20 development could be also categorized or
37:22 paraphrased as reality agnostic you no
37:29 longer regimented to whatever you think
37:32 was real
37:34 you can choose sort of what is real now
37:39 let me throw this at you we know that we
37:43 perceive the
37:44 differently than all of their people
37:45 right I perceive a different than you
37:47 perceive it I've ever met anyone that
37:49 loves the city and you hate it you know
37:52 they're like oh my god I can't wait to
37:55 live in you know some freezing cold
37:58 state that has never seen eighty degrees
38:01 temperature and the people are weird and
38:03 you just you you go there to visit and
38:05 you just or maybe you live there for a
38:07 little while and you just can't get
38:08 along with anyone everything they do
38:10 just bothers you and you didn't want it
38:13 to be that way it just you could never
38:15 make it work for you but you know where
38:19 you live those people can't stand where
38:21 you live and you're in like you know
38:25 semi-tropical Southern California with
38:27 palm trees and 73 weather most of the
38:30 year and nothing gets that harsh either
38:32 way and you're like why wouldn't you
38:33 want to live here
38:34 we got beaches that are damn near 1/10
38:36 of a mile before you get to the water
38:38 it's everyone's nice and friendly and
38:40 they want to network you into any career
38:43 that you want anything that you want in
38:44 life everyone's here to help you and
38:46 people hate it you're like what the
38:49 hell's wrong with you because you
38:51 perceive this place different than they
38:53 do and they perceive their place
38:54 different than you do you know that we
38:57 taste things differently
38:58 some people like burn marshmallows some
39:01 people like lightly brown marshmallows
39:03 why is that well we're built different
39:06 for one of those arguments it's a matter
39:08 of taste physically your taste buds work
39:11 differently for other people it's sort
39:16 of feeling like this is your home
39:18 I always wonder why people from Germany
39:23 found themselves in Kansas of all places
39:26 no Germans have shuttled all over
39:27 America but for whatever reason a
39:29 gigantic portion of them loved the
39:31 Midwest of America I couldn't figure it
39:35 out for the longest time until I started
39:36 getting pictures from an old girlfriend
39:38 of mine who lives in Germany she's from
39:40 Germany and she would send me her home
39:42 and I was looking at it going oh my god
39:44 this could be Kansas No
39:47 southern Germany is much more voluptuous
39:51 with hills and stuff but there's a part
39:53 of northern Germany that is very
39:56 Midwestern
39:58 perhaps the southern Germans go to
39:59 places in America have very mountainous
40:01 while the other ones from the north are
40:03 going to the more flattened area because
40:05 it feels like home they are different
40:08 now let's take that preference that we
40:11 see here in this world and that's
40:13 applied to ourselves when it comes to
40:14 reality you feel comfortable in reality
40:20 most likely you know that there's people
40:22 who dress up like Ninja Turtles they are
40:25 living in their home wearing a costume
40:27 of a turtle they've seen every movie
40:29 they know every line out of all the
40:33 turtles either they're one of the I
40:34 think those four Turtles right or
40:36 they're a fifth turtle for those of you
40:40 grew up in the 70s are going to get a
40:41 kick out of this because you probably
40:42 remember for any of you who are kiss
40:44 fans back in the day yeah I'm talking
40:46 about the band Kiss gene Simmons and
40:48 Paul Stanley Peter Criss Ace Frehley
40:50 they wore this you know four different
40:52 makeups for did four different
40:54 backstories if you watched kiss Meets
40:56 The Phantom and as kids you would be one
41:00 of those four characters for a while and
41:03 then at one point you create a fifth
41:05 character all right because you want to
41:07 be a part of the band you want to be
41:08 part of that world and it was just
41:10 escape in your brain now that's why
41:13 writers believe that writing and fiction
41:17 is SuperDuper important to the human
41:18 mind because it allows us to exercise
41:20 our perception of different what
41:23 realities right there's a ton of people
41:26 in this world who have picked their
41:27 career by seeing a movie they saw a
41:31 profession they saw a responsibility
41:32 they saw an impact of that professional
41:34 responsibility on this world and so they
41:38 wanted to go and do it I got a book in
41:41 my house that's based on the Hal 9000
41:46 from 2001 a Space Odyssey and how many
41:48 artificial intelligence programmers we
41:50 gained by simply seeing a fictional
41:52 character in a movie at a time when we
41:55 didn't have enough processor power to
41:56 really create an artificial intelligence
41:58 and so they studied AI and probably are
42:02 some of the leading any programmers in
42:04 the world and this book is all about
42:06 some of the heads of state of that
42:08 research and development that said man
42:11 cool let's make that pretty wild right I
42:16 think the folks that would be the best
42:19 equipped to do dream exploration are
42:23 those folks that dream habitually dream
42:26 in great detail but also when they're in
42:29 this world they have the ability to
42:32 disengage a little bit and I don't mean
42:35 in any dysfunctional way I think true
42:39 genius is the ability to sit in this
42:43 world and maintain a foot in both
42:48 universes if not multiple universes
42:50 right I'm sitting here right now staring
42:54 at my computer doing an episode to you
42:56 and inside my mind's eye I can see two
43:00 dreams that I've had in the last
43:01 probably had it two days ago I actually
43:04 woke up and drew some stuff into my
43:06 phone because it was one of them was so
43:08 funny one is the print stream I can
43:11 still see him next to me on my left and
43:13 there was this little Inlet and to the
43:15 floor where he had this little setup or
43:17 you can kind of go down and sit on the
43:18 step and there was his library of
43:22 recordings it was sort of in some sort
43:26 of like almost seedy thing behind us to
43:30 my left er some of his bodyguards and
43:32 family like a might a over there and
43:34 then behind me sounds crazy right behind
43:36 me is my kid and my girlfriend musics
43:39 playing and people are just having a
43:41 good time not too loud you know like
43:42 music playing lightly in the background
43:44 he's just jiving me man he's just having
43:46 a blast because he knows that I really
43:49 want to hear everything that's in this
43:50 box and he's like pick one pick one and
43:53 I picked it and I threw it at him and he
43:55 literally caught it and and he's like he
43:59 was doing games like odda you don't hear
44:01 that one first you know and so I'm
44:04 looking like I don't know anything
44:05 sounds like right but I want to hear it
44:06 alright so he's messing with me so I got
44:08 that in my head almost like it happened
44:10 to me yesterday right
44:12 the other one was really funny that I
44:15 don't know what the dream was all about
44:17 but there was a moment in the dream
44:19 where
44:23 there's a character a person a dream
44:26 friend right that sort of moving from
44:31 point A to point B and I was there and I
44:33 was saying oh there you are you know
44:35 those kind of moments and I said what he
44:37 been doing and he I could see something
44:40 under his t-shirt
44:42 and he picks up his t-shirt it's on his
44:45 belly so on the right side of his gut
44:47 her left side of his gut and it's this
44:49 line that goes down it's a squiggly ass
44:51 line that goes down and goes across his
44:52 gut and it's made of like a phone core
44:55 like a phone almost like a the spongy
44:58 kind that can turn into stickers you
45:00 know and it was a varying depths and it
45:02 looked like a cartoon outline literally
45:06 an outline of a cut in his stomach it
45:10 was all cartoony it was actually white
45:11 and I think maybe the center had some
45:16 color in it but above the right where'd
45:18 it turn and went down the left side of
45:20 his body about three inches and then
45:22 turned across his gut and went about ten
45:24 inches across his gut and it had in
45:27 fancy kind of font so like a French kind
45:31 of font it said something about like
45:35 it's like Sergio got me and I looked at
45:38 him and what I realized in my mind this
45:41 is what my mind's illustrating in
45:42 seconds right was that this guy went off
45:45 and saw a movie that was about a guy
45:48 that cut people and it must have been a
45:51 comedy okay because it looked like this
45:54 sticker thing was handed out at the
45:57 movie theater and so you could wear this
45:59 thing and it would it was your it was a
46:01 marketing schemes brilliant marketing
46:03 idea right that you would wear this
46:05 thing outside the theater and it was a
46:07 way to promote the movie and tell your
46:11 friends you had seen this funny movie
46:13 where this guy I guess cut people and it
46:16 was nothing gross about it but of course
46:18 cutting a belly would be obviously hard
46:21 to make funny okay but I remember
46:24 staring at and I'm gone oh did you see a
46:26 movie some but this is about he's like
46:28 yeah yeah yeah and I'm just laughing in
46:31 the dream I'm like that is utterly
46:32 hilarious and brilliant right so I woke
46:35 up and I drew it
46:36 get on my phone and [ __ ] like that
46:41 happens you know and what that does is
46:45 that put such a pin in my brain for a
46:47 fantasy experience that didn't happen
46:49 that happened in a dream that what I'm
46:50 sitting here talking to you I can
46:51 reminisce about it like it really
46:53 happened none of that happened in this
46:56 reality happened in the other reality
46:59 well how is it that things are getting
47:01 so beautifully profound I mean I've had
47:04 dreams of seventeen while staying with
47:06 my grandparents that I remember to this
47:10 day I had a I had a baby in this dream
47:14 when I was 17 I didn't have my kid till
47:16 I was 25 but there's a baby and I'm
47:19 taking care of her it's a little girl
47:21 and I'm in this front room my
47:24 grandparents and all of a sudden you
47:27 know I put her down on the sofa to rest
47:29 she's literally just a baby baby
47:30 brand-new man and then also I look over
47:33 and she's in this shoebox mechanism I
47:35 was like a shoebox about the size of her
47:37 body and she's all wrapped up nice in
47:39 there and the shoebox had like a little
47:40 bit of electronics in it and it was
47:43 keeping her safe it was making sure she
47:45 know any SIDS or anything like that
47:47 right and I remember you know it was
47:49 sort of alarming at first to go my god
47:50 you know this isn't gonna hurt my child
47:52 I was looking at it and my grandmother
47:55 came back in the room what's going on
47:56 you know and I'm like oh yeah I guess
47:57 she's okay she's on this thing that was
48:00 a million years ago people but I
48:03 remember it like it was yesterday when
48:07 that occurs you have a dream so profound
48:10 that you can remember it when you're
48:12 awake is if it happened in real life
48:13 there's something very interesting about
48:16 that it became a mini little reality and
48:21 I think that's fascinating you might
48:25 call it as a scientific exercise
48:26 cross-pollination between realities I
48:29 was going to bed last night I thought
48:32 for some reason the song Lucy in the Sky
48:34 with Diamonds popped in my brain and you
48:39 know sadly I'm not a Beatles fan I don't
48:41 dislike them or anything but I just
48:42 before my time
48:44 what I really didn't like about the
48:46 Beatles I think when I was a kid was
48:47 that they were so famous that when I
48:49 would see them on TV it was all the
48:51 screaming kids I never owned the albums
48:53 I couldn't just enjoy it
48:54 by myself right so it's a stupid reason
48:58 but that's the reason anyway I started
49:00 thinking about you know Lucy in the Sky
49:02 with Diamonds which is supposedly about
49:04 acid in the Sky with Diamonds started to
49:09 make sense to me last night and for
49:13 those of you who put this together
49:14 decades and decades ago you're gonna
49:16 laugh your ass off at how long it took
49:18 me to put this together but when you're
49:20 on acid one of the things that happens
49:22 sometimes is that you look up in the sky
49:25 and the sky is geometry it's like sacred
49:30 geometry diamonds in the sky and every
49:34 single I don't know overexposed
49:38 overexposed pointer and your retina
49:41 turns into a pinpoint and then around
49:43 that point it draws sacred geometry like
49:48 the circular kind that you've seen a
49:49 million times in floor ductile
49:51 arrangements that those guys weren't
49:53 [ __ ] tripping balls when they saw
49:55 that stuff I guarantee you it's not all
49:56 came together but also draws lines
50:00 between them in the sky it's wild in
50:03 fact my buddy took me outside on my
50:05 first trip and he goes look at the sky
50:06 he said I even want to I was having so
50:08 much fun inside tripping out he said you
50:10 gotta look at this guy here's a here's a
50:12 blanket lie down look up he's seen the
50:14 same thing I'm seeing and that's wild
50:18 all right that is [ __ ] freaky seeing
50:21 the same thing while you're tripping is
50:23 almost 10th amount to going to bed in
50:26 the same house with someone else and
50:28 saying I'll see you in my dreams and it
50:30 really happens and you wake up in hell
50:32 wasn't that cool god that was great you
50:34 know that missile falls guy was really
50:35 weird that doesn't happen right let me
50:39 know if that's ever happened to you what
50:42 I would love love love love to have
50:45 happen in this world is the discussion
50:47 about dreams becomes a mainstay article
50:49 of topic between us as human beings I
50:53 think what will happen again is I think
50:56 that you know I have faith in the
50:59 children of this world because they
51:00 aren't so
51:02 indoctrinated into paradigms they're not
51:04 limiting themselves as much they haven't
51:06 limited everything a way that is
51:07 beautiful they haven't been taught
51:09 racism you know they haven't been taught
51:11 their limitations out of pure [ __ ]
51:14 right and so they're the ones that are
51:17 probably solve all the mysteries of the
51:19 world if we could just stop treating
51:20 them like idiots like children you know
51:23 for the parents that say oh my god I
51:26 want my kid to grow up too fast
51:27 well yeah you don't want to show them
51:28 beheading videos online or try to take
51:30 away their gender through you know
51:32 watching HBO but what you want to do it
51:36 treat them like adults when it comes to
51:38 technology say hey this is how this
51:40 works I know you can understand it
51:42 because you're smart you know if you're
51:44 really existential you say look I know
51:46 that you were just recently somebody
51:48 else and you just recently came back
51:50 into this body and so you probably you
51:53 know have a chance of having been a
51:55 physicist on the other side or some
51:57 musician on the other side I'm simply
51:59 going to make you remember how good you
52:01 are at these things so what do you think
52:04 gravity is we have two theories which
52:05 one do you think is right and the kid
52:07 will just go oh well you know if that's
52:09 this and this is that that says that
52:11 doesn't work but this one over here is
52:13 pretty good and but you know I think
52:14 you're forgetting this do that well we
52:16 don't treat kids like that do we like oh
52:19 I'm so sorry you're so dumb you child
52:22 Rufi taught kids the dreaming is another
52:25 world
52:26 a real one just as real as this one
52:29 however it doesn't feel like this one
52:32 all right to compare two things is sort
52:36 of foolish right isn't football sport
52:41 isn't baseball sport isn't the extreme
52:45 sports where the kids ride rails and go
52:48 half tubing or surfing or whatever but
52:51 none of them have anything in common
52:53 except it's considered a sport it has
52:55 competition in it and usually has some
52:56 physical aptitude or coordination it's a
52:58 part of why we call it a sport so
53:01 reality and reality that's the same what
53:05 ends up creating one reality versus
53:08 another is a different bag of things
53:11 different bag of tricks right you might
53:14 say well this one's real why
53:15 this one's better oh really how is it
53:17 better well feel it it's better you know
53:20 you really get to do things in this you
53:21 you stay more awake in this reality than
53:24 the other reality ok Touche but I can't
53:27 fly in this reality can I I can't go on
53:30 stage with the prince and sing can I so
53:36 why is this one better again perhaps
53:39 they're equal in different ways
53:42 there's the age-old saying that we're
53:44 all born equal I have some friends in
53:47 Los Angeles as a we and all equal but I
53:50 think the way that that is meant to be
53:52 is that everyone has their special
53:54 something and yours may not be as
53:58 celebrated as others right you know
54:00 let's say you could write and direct a
54:03 movie well that's the one that's really
54:05 celebrated but if you're I don't know
54:09 really good at playing the spoons or
54:11 cooking or taking care of kids or loving
54:14 your wife or husband that one's like
54:16 whatever yeah the most difficult ones
54:19 are the ones that are so minimized right
54:21 I think there has to be a reason why we
54:24 must sleep you know for those of you
54:29 who've never heard and you have the any
54:31 of the other episodes long timers bear
54:34 with me because I want to make sure
54:35 everyone comes away with this thought if
54:37 you're gonna jump into one of my dream
54:38 episodes I'm want to put this into your
54:40 brain before it's over if dreaming is
54:45 simply something or excuse me sleeping
54:47 is something that is a result of needing
54:49 to sleep you need to rest your body you
54:52 need to supposedly heal your body and
54:55 then we have this weird biological clock
54:57 we do got this weird biological rhythm
55:00 inside our brains that says look you
55:02 typically go to bed at 10:00 and if you
55:04 start to deviate from typically going to
55:06 bed at 10:00 at 11:00 you're gonna be
55:08 really freaking tired that is a reality
55:10 whether it be where we are in the
55:12 universe whether or not our souls are
55:16 literally on some timer for the vessel I
55:19 don't know why okay and there's a bunch
55:21 of flippin answers as to why believe me
55:23 I'm aware of all the flippin answers
55:25 being an arrest and you're tired okay if
55:28 you spend an entire day
55:29 goofing off sleeping messing around
55:32 you'll still be tired at 10:00 if that's
55:34 when you go to bed get your biological
55:37 rhythm but now if you relaxed a lot if
55:41 you relaxed a lot you really took it
55:42 easy man your body has no torn muscles
55:45 you've eaten well not too much but
55:49 you've eaten well you're just a healthy
55:50 person why can't you stay up two or
55:52 three days why can't you just electively
55:55 go I'm just gonna skip sleeping I don't
55:57 really need it I have no injuries I'm
55:59 not ill I'm not trying to fight off a
56:01 cold body's healthy why is this imposed
56:05 on you perhaps it's something that
56:08 either you know intelligent design put
56:12 into us to ensure that this cycle
56:14 doesn't get all screwed up because those
56:15 outside of the cycle don't get along
56:17 with society because when we were in
56:19 village times or cave times or whatever
56:21 depending on whatever the hell happened
56:23 in the past you needed to be in sync
56:25 with with the rest of the tribe perhaps
56:28 that's just as easy as that you know I
56:31 think it's fascinating that when women
56:33 get together their menstrual cycles all
56:35 go together that's phenomenal isn't that
56:39 really really weird you know we we go
56:41 past those little realities sometimes
56:44 without thinking about it and saying
56:46 okay back in the day ladies and gents I
56:49 think the ladies know this already but
56:51 when women had to go through this face
56:55 they would go outside the tribe and they
57:00 would I've seen it in this reality right
57:03 now still exists women in more primitive
57:06 tribes around the world will go to a
57:07 river or stream it's not a raging river
57:10 but some type of stream and they will
57:12 spend their week or whatever three to
57:17 five days and this it's not far away but
57:20 it's you know it's within the defending
57:22 distance of the males but they'll be
57:24 outside the village and they will take
57:25 turns being in the river because there
57:28 were no sanitation napkins or anything
57:30 to help them out it just keeps them
57:31 clean that still happens to this day
57:35 because they're all in sync we are
57:39 designed amazingly Allah spoke that way
57:41 I find that um one of the things that
57:46 gets into sync is dreaming not the
57:49 dreams themselves but the frequency of
57:52 dreams and for those of you who have
57:56 spouses I would be interested to know
57:58 that if the husband dreams a lot does
58:01 the spouse dream a lot or vice versa I
58:04 know that when I have lived with my
58:08 girlfriends I'll be dreaming like crazy
58:11 in the other room and to the degree I
58:15 dream the other person dreams we
58:18 separate you know she'll spend some time
58:20 at her place or whatever and it I get
58:24 reports back there's no dreaming so
58:27 here's sort of the commenting homework
58:30 for you guys you guys are so brilliant
58:32 and just if I could just sponge up all
58:35 your brains there'll be a fantasy for me
58:38 what other ways can we develop our
58:41 dreams what are the things can we do how
58:46 do we analyze them again let's not wait
58:49 for a university to write some [ __ ]
58:51 document to get a grant to do something
58:53 very left brain before we know anything
58:56 more about dreams and let's not dive off
59:00 and to people making money off people
59:01 trying to translate what those dreams
59:03 mean this is it we are the citizens of
59:09 this planet we're here we own this place
59:13 it's our responsibility we want to be
59:17 enlightened well there's a million ways
59:19 to be enlightened what does it might
59:20 mean to see more that's it go see my
59:24 episode on enlightenment right I think
59:27 we just need to start owning things
59:29 there's a lot of you who are
59:31 self-starters in your what we call doers
59:33 then you and I are very similar
59:35 what's a doer do with a kind of person
59:39 that gets into a situation that is
59:42 perhaps an event that's being
59:43 coordinated at your church or at your
59:45 work or within some community enough a
59:47 barbecue or whatever family reunion or
59:49 family event and you have certain people
59:52 standing around going
59:53 who's bringing the hotdogs you know and
59:56 they won't lift a finger to do anything
59:58 and within seconds here they're setting
60:01 up tables getting the barbecue ready
60:04 making sure whoever can cook is on that
60:05 thing and you're setting it up and doing
60:07 the logistics right well if you're one
60:10 of those people then you're part of this
60:12 dream team your assignment is to figure
60:15 out more about dreams more about the
60:18 distinctions between that reality in
60:21 this reality and what you want to do in
60:22 my opinion be very careful about trying
60:25 to take what you read from a book and
60:27 pull it into this conversation you can
60:29 do it but let's make sure it's something
60:31 very exceptional to the rule of
60:34 interpreting of interpreting dreams and
60:36 what sleep means right try not to go off
60:38 and do the biological explanations of
60:40 dreams because those are so sterile and
60:42 you know it's it's what every kid knows
60:44 is what anyone could assume into you
60:46 know you you could basically go in and
60:48 say I'm going to give you a test on what
60:50 sleeping is all about and you get an
60:51 a-plus right because nothing's profound
60:53 in the test it's it's the basics we are
60:57 looking to take this two-sided coin one
61:01 side is all the crap that you've been
61:02 told your whole life and we want to flip
61:04 it over to the other side which has
61:06 barely ever been discussed barely ever
61:08 been researched and we want to read
61:11 what's on the other side I'd like to
61:13 know if any of you have sensed your
61:17 transition from being awake to being
61:20 asleep to being in dream mode
61:22 were you ever conscious to the degree
61:25 you can remember it when you wake up if
61:27 any of you have the experience of the
61:29 projected history that I've talked about
61:30 within a second
61:32 you've manifested it some history it's
61:35 almost people with no names and you have
61:37 some responsibility within resolving
61:39 this and then you go oh none of that
61:42 exists none of this is real have any of
61:45 you had an alternate reality triggered
61:48 when you're traveling the world when
61:51 you're messing around triggered by a
61:53 smell triggered by the daytime lighting
61:57 anything what do we have to gain if we
62:01 can pierce some of this reality I think
62:04 we can enjoy this world a hell of a lot
62:06 more
62:06 right again let's say that there's a few
62:11 of you out there look at your life and
62:13 you're like oh man I have [ __ ]
62:15 everything up it's so messed up my job
62:18 is messed up what I wanted to do with my
62:20 life is messed up you know why can't I
62:22 win you know those kind of feelings as
62:25 feelings that lead to more feelings in
62:28 that same area and I could step up to
62:30 you surpris you walk up to you and go
62:34 you know me right
62:35 you're like oh my god you're the dude
62:37 from that show and I'm like yeah come
62:39 with me for a second just put all this
62:41 crap down trust me you're all right it's
62:44 all gonna be here when you get back in
62:46 fact we're not even gonna consume any
62:47 time out of this reality you're gonna be
62:49 in this time bubble with me you're like
62:51 oh okay got nothing else to do let's
62:54 pull this off what are you gonna do and
62:56 I take you and I pull you into some
62:57 alternate reality and it's hovering over
63:00 the one that you're in and I see you see
63:04 that down there you see this reality up
63:06 here and you're like oh my god where the
63:08 hell am i I'm like well they're in one
63:12 of infinite realities that exist you
63:15 know when you dream know yeah I know
63:18 well that's just you touring through the
63:22 infinite realities that exist and you by
63:25 the way are a creator because your
63:26 creators given you the opportunity to
63:28 create again like I said in the previous
63:31 episode you ever wonder how these dreams
63:34 are so photo-real what are you a
63:36 computer are you a 3d artist are you
63:38 your own rendering engine you get all
63:42 the lighting right you got a sound right
63:44 you actually dream up other people's
63:46 faces places and things you dream up
63:48 skyscrapers and spaceships and whatever
63:51 how are you doing all that you can't do
63:53 that during the day I mean you can if
63:56 you daydream but if I give you a pennant
63:58 or a bunch of paint and a canvas and I
64:01 say paint it now paint what you saw in
64:04 your dream you can't do it unless you're
64:06 Syd Mead right even he tells me he can't
64:11 get what he thinks in his mind down to
64:12 the canvas but I his worst days God's
64:17 best day right
64:19 we have this experience together you
64:21 could spend as much time up here with me
64:23 and ask me all the questions about
64:24 reality and in the end what you really
64:27 realize is it's the one you're in
64:29 there's one that perhaps maybe you chose
64:32 to be in you didn't maybe specifically
64:35 challenge is all the challenges that you
64:38 are having specifically but you may have
64:41 said you know at last time I went in it
64:42 was level two yeah I had a good time but
64:45 you know what in the end even though I
64:47 was super famous for this or that or
64:49 whatever I had 22 kids and it all went
64:51 well and everyone turned out to be
64:52 wonderful no one died before they were
64:54 supposed to die I died of natural causes
64:57 I'm looking for some more grit you know
64:59 and I chose level 5 I guess this is well
65:03 over five looks like and I go yeah you
65:04 did you totally chose that you didn't
65:07 want to write the whole game out you
65:09 didn't want to write every single thing
65:10 that could happen to you and just live
65:12 out some script you left a lot of
65:15 variables in there now you ready to go
65:18 back down warts and all challenges and
65:22 all like yeah I guess I chose it I can
65:26 you know what you're gonna be okay
65:27 because as soon as your vessels done
65:29 down there guess where you go and you're
65:31 gonna go here and I say yeah we're gonna
65:35 go anywhere you want to go man you'll be
65:37 able to take a break maybe you want to
65:40 go back down to level four if you'd like
65:42 to do a level two again maybe level five
65:46 turns out to be more satisfying you
65:48 could possibly imagine
65:49 like the toughest video game in the
65:51 world and eventually you solved all the
65:53 puzzles you rescued Zelda you know I
65:58 can't you're right I'll see what I think
66:00 when I'm done and you go back down into
66:02 your body and just like the guy in
66:05 Twilight Zone that had his reality where
66:06 he changed it and got rid of everyone
66:08 the world then eventually wished
66:09 everybody back and he he accepted his
66:12 world warts and all and then when stuff
66:17 happens
66:17 you literally go home that day from this
66:19 little experience that we had and you
66:23 you get like a notice in the mail that
66:26 you're being audited by the IRS your
66:28 your powers being turned off tomorrow
66:31 and all this other stuff and you just
66:32 look at those pieces of
66:33 and they're not gonna kill you not gonna
66:36 put you in jail and you just go yeah I'm
66:43 gonna deal with this and you know what
66:45 maybe I got some more bumps maybe I got
66:46 a really rough road for the next year or
66:48 two as I get rid of these problems I got
66:50 in front of me right now but in the end
66:51 I know it's gonna be okay
66:54 I chose this I've been given everything
66:59 I need to overcome these obstacles even
67:01 though at times you may not believe you
67:03 can you can maybe dreams are nothing
67:06 more than a confirmation of such a thing
67:08 maybe dreams nothing more than a
67:10 confirmation that there are other
67:12 realities that you can be and then are
67:13 totally at your will do you need your
67:20 body in the dream yeah I think you don't
67:23 I think that you exist in those dreams
67:25 floating around warm in your blankets
67:29 warm in your dream yeah you're different
67:32 places and you don't really have your
67:35 bed attached to your back you're not
67:36 lying down horizontally but you have the
67:39 same comfort the womb of a dream maybe
67:44 people who don't dream
67:47 absolutely love reality this reality and
67:50 so they don't need it your dreams are
67:54 the sort of the the psychiatrist's sofa
67:58 the Shea's lounge that you're lying down
68:01 on right
68:01 maybe when you're totally content with
68:04 all things there's no mysteries maybe
68:06 that's what it is
68:07 there's nothing to do with being
68:09 satisfied or unsatisfied it's just
68:10 you're totally content what what's wrong
68:13 with that
68:14 you don't need dreams you're living one
68:18 but the more that you stretch out your
68:20 brain and you're like man I've eaten
68:23 this reality up four or five times right
68:26 and I have I have eaten the machine the
68:29 machine hasn't eaten me and now you're
68:31 just sitting there like I want some more
68:33 I want some more stuff to just devour
68:37 dreams show up and go all right well
68:40 let's get you oriented to what you could
68:42 possibly do then you can pick it you
68:46 know so like
68:47 I used to work back in the day first two
68:49 years help you declare the major for the
68:51 last two years and get your ball
68:54 bearings you know together is your
68:56 orientation to the other where am i what
68:59 do I like anymore oh that used to be
69:02 something I wanted to do and then I did
69:04 it for ten years and I don't want to do
69:05 it anymore
69:06 yeah I want you to feel in control of
69:10 your life dreams are your playground to
69:15 practice all the things that you might
69:17 want to do in this world and what you
69:18 need to understand I think is the dreams
69:21 I believe at times can carry major
69:25 metaphor and symbolism for what you
69:27 really want to do in life it may be not
69:30 be literal may not be literal if you
69:34 keep dreaming of a location for instance
69:36 that's much different in the location
69:39 that you live perhaps you live in a
69:42 rural town it's dirt everywhere all the
69:44 cars are filthy constantly because
69:46 everyone's driving on dirt roads
69:47 everything is made of brick buildings
69:49 would you keep dreaming of the big city
69:51 yeah maybe need to 4ei into the big city
69:54 get it out of your system go take a
69:56 vacation first maybe stay with a friend
69:59 for a month walk around the city see if
70:01 it's what you want a lot of times you'll
70:03 find out which where you live is exactly
70:05 where you want to be but you have to
70:06 shake it out of your system I bet you
70:09 won't dream about it that much if it's
70:11 not where you want to be but you might
70:13 go to the big city and look around and
70:14 go this is what I want concrete and
70:16 steel I don't want to see any trees or
70:19 grass you know but it represents
70:21 something else for you some other major
70:23 arc of opportunity maybe you want a
70:26 tropical island
70:28 maybe you visit Hawaii on vacation and
70:30 you're like holy [ __ ] there's something
70:33 about this place maybe it's not exactly
70:35 Hawaii that you go to but maybe it's
70:37 some other remote location it represents
70:41 freedom for you regardless of what
70:44 dreams are I do believe that we create
70:46 them out of ourselves we have metaphor
70:51 symbolism meaning purpose they're a
70:56 playground
70:58 but we have to develop our senses around
71:01 each dream around each day of
71:03 exploration so that we can figure
71:06 ourselves out and for those of you
71:12 having bad dreams let me just end the
71:15 episode on this if you are person it has
71:20 nightmares the chances are that in this
71:23 world this particular reality that we're
71:25 sharing you might be a little meek
71:28 passive you don't have confidence for
71:32 whatever reason someone shook it out of
71:36 you when you were a kid nightmares might
71:40 be the most amazing tool for you to gain
71:43 the confidence that you've always wanted
71:45 in your entire lifetime and there's a
71:48 trick again this happened to me when I
71:51 was a kid I had nightmares from probably
71:54 three to seven and what ended up
72:00 happening yeah I'm not gonna go retell
72:02 the story because it's in my other dream
72:03 episodes ghosts go listen if you want to
72:06 hear those but there's a point when
72:09 you're in your dream and doesn't matter
72:12 what is after you what is creating the
72:14 nightmare what is freaking you out
72:16 here's what I want you to do against all
72:19 logic of this world but you're gonna
72:22 find out it's gonna work in this world
72:24 really really well
72:25 okay I want you to go after whatever's
72:29 going after you if there's a monster a
72:32 circumstance whatever sometimes they're
72:36 not monsters sometimes they're not
72:37 things sometimes you're just in a weird
72:39 place I want you to if you deal with the
72:44 monster of any kind some threats some
72:47 being of any kind I want you to turn
72:51 around face that being and say out loud
72:56 to your best ability I'm going to tear
73:01 you limb from limb and then go and do it
73:04 and I don't care if it's Godzilla and
73:06 he's 50 stories high it's gonna be like
73:09 bambam grabbing his big toe and you're
73:11 gonna
73:11 slam that dude left right left right
73:13 left right until he is your [ __ ] right
73:15 go after it and you will find that
73:19 there's no capacity in your brain for a
73:21 fight within a dream not much anyway
73:24 you will start winning instantaneously
73:27 beyond your wildest dreams and when you
73:30 wake up you'll find out there's no
73:34 monster in this reality that is remotely
73:36 like the one in your dreams in your
73:38 nightmares now you could be physically
73:41 threatened by someone in this world and
73:42 be manifesting a dream in that case
73:45 maybe you don't go face to face with
73:47 whatever is doing in this world but you
73:49 sure as hell can escape in most cases be
73:52 quiet don't tell anybody and just you
73:54 know vamoose right but if you're an
73:58 existential moment where you just simply
74:00 find yourself in a place there's no one
74:03 there but it's just unnerving it's
74:06 illogical perhaps I once woke up in a
74:09 dream where I was floating in blackness
74:12 there was no ground there was tow
74:15 anything I was floating in utter
74:17 blackness and the only thing I could
74:19 potentially see it was this seemed to be
74:22 a very faint light source from somewhere
74:25 there was no point light in the room I
74:27 was sort of floating that wasn't falling
74:30 that might have been a little bit more
74:31 freaky I'm not sure my dream can
74:33 actually manifest that but there was um
74:37 sort of that floating particle thing you
74:40 know like there's just ambient particles
74:42 in the air it wasn't technically a
74:45 nightmare but it definitely didn't feel
74:46 you know comforting to have no reference
74:49 points for anything you know I felt like
74:51 as I was swimming and I just made peace
74:55 with it and I closed my eyes and I said
74:59 I'm just here I was gonna be here and I
75:02 woke up and was over never been back
75:05 since each nightmare could be defeated
75:09 by a strategy but it's not gonna be by
75:12 you being meek it's gonna be by you
75:13 either coming to peace with it and
75:16 saying you know what you can't hurt me
75:18 or maybe you have to go after it the
75:21 only the solution I had to a dream that
75:24 was sort of
75:25 bizarre it's happened decades ago I
75:29 found myself and a dream that was I was
75:32 just in a place that I thought was sort
75:35 of surrounded by evil if you will
75:38 nothing was presenting itself to me
75:40 whatsoever I felt threatened for the
75:43 first few seconds as if I was in some
75:46 hopeless negative scenario going to be
75:49 overwhelmed by this negativity but then
75:53 I remembered that I believed in God
75:57 and those of you who are atheists can
76:01 can map this over to your own self
76:03 manifestation power but for those of you
76:06 who are religious didn't like this I
76:08 don't have Jesus I had God and I simply
76:14 stood there if I wasn't naked I was just
76:19 in my underwear and I called down the
76:22 power of God and I created a [ __ ]
76:27 supernova in this universe of brightness
76:29 and light you know you've seen the death
76:34 star exploding in star wars right
76:36 especially the revised ones were the has
76:38 all the cool you know phalanges kind of
76:41 explosion noises this was a an explosion
76:46 of light that was the size of the
76:47 universe itself
76:49 started off the size of a man floating
76:52 in the universe standing on a ball in a
76:55 really weird place but I called down
76:59 this mega Nova you know and all of a
77:04 sudden the camera pulled back just like
77:06 a movie
77:06 and this sphere almost like a hydrogen
77:09 bomb but again it just kept going boom
77:12 boom boom boo-boom boo-boom and it's
77:13 just getting bigger and more velocity
77:15 and more intense nasai in my mind it was
77:19 God reporting in for duty causing this
77:24 massive explosion of pure perfectness
77:27 and I knew that I was in the center and
77:30 that nothing could exist inside God's
77:33 space that was evil because he can't
77:37 coexist with it
77:38 I know that we have a subjective
77:40 definition of what is evil but then we
77:42 have you know some politicians that we
77:45 know engage in it every day but this
77:48 thing just overwhelmed the entire
77:49 universe and turned it from blackness to
77:52 light and when I came out of that dream
77:58 this is like maybe 35 plus years ago I'm
78:03 in my teens any time I found myself in
78:07 this world where I felt like I was just
78:10 surrounded by negativity like it's
78:12 almost that whole vision of sitting in
78:14 the world and you just feel like you're
78:16 just being attacked by demons right
78:17 you're just really if it's not real but
78:20 just just naggy weird negative feelings
78:23 you're just being open to it and again
78:25 like the the episode I made about the
78:28 fact that negativity I think comes from
78:30 the outside and positivity comes from
78:32 the on inside you know you don't own all
78:34 the thoughts that you that you observe
78:38 similar to that I will sit wherever I am
78:42 in the world and I'll supernova that
78:45 baby with the power of the universe and
78:48 you'll be amazed how good you feel
78:52 instantaneously as if again around me is
78:57 an infinitely large bubble of positivity
79:00 created by the universe that can't be
79:03 penetrated by evil if you haven't tried
79:06 it try it I was taught that by a dream
79:09 what if dreams are that powerful and
79:11 that meaningful to those who endorse it
79:14 those who develop it what if this is one
79:19 of the biggest secrets of being a human
79:21 being is to understand that the dream
79:24 world is really your workshop to perfect
79:27 your life to understand who you are to
79:30 understand what you're capable of to
79:33 understand your preferences and to
79:36 understand that you're not alone no
79:39 matter how alone you are in this reality
79:41 right I think you feel me if you haven't
79:46 been to deep thoughts radio.com
