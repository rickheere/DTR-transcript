00:29 welcome back to the lounge ladies and
00:31 gentlemen it's another rain situation
00:35 outside so it's just sprinkling but you
00:39 can never tell when it's gonna start
00:40 porn it's kind of tropical rained at
00:43 this point so as you can tell we're
00:47 gonna talks about some alien [ __ ] you
00:50 know we've covered the alien subject so
00:52 much it's ridiculous but I'm starting to
00:55 hearing a lot again because we're
00:57 starting to notice that the deep state
00:58 is losing and so we suspect that they're
01:01 gonna do anything they can to you know
01:04 [ __ ] us over but I thought I was
01:06 thinking okay so we're gonna split this
01:08 in half we're gonna take a stab at what
01:10 an actual alien invasion might look like
01:13 like a real one because I I did think I
01:16 didn't episode a long time ago but I did
01:18 it about the fake one and just a lot of
01:22 epiphanies some dreams and the other
01:28 thing is I've been thinking about the
01:29 other part too which is if they were
01:30 gonna try to fake an alien invasion what
01:35 might that look like
01:36 and what's really interesting is I hear
01:39 it mentioned all the time it's like this
01:42 people will just drop it well you know
01:43 might be doing your fake alien invasion
01:45 and no one ever talks about what that
01:47 might look like that weird so we always
01:52 do the Paul Harvey on this show right
01:54 we'll get to the some meat potatoes here
01:59 okay so there is a day let's just say
02:06 because with this alien invasion there's
02:09 a few scenarios right there's a scenario
02:12 where man they just show up and they're
02:15 ballin and maybe they don't like us or
02:18 something they start tearing [ __ ] up
02:22 then there's sort of the soft invasion
02:25 which is there's a star and it's moving
02:28 around the sky and it gets our attention
02:30 and it starts drawing Mickey Mouse's
02:31 face or whatever
02:34 starts playing that song from Close
02:36 Encounters and then they come down
02:41 Devil's Tower whatever
02:43 maybe it's Washington DC meets Moscow
02:46 maybe it's all major cities or whatever
02:48 and then some Gort comes out some big
02:53 lurchy dude comes out and he's carrying
02:57 the book to serve man or something like
02:58 that and another scenario third one is
03:04 that they are living among us and then
03:08 one day just simply reveal themselves
03:11 for that latter one which is interesting
03:13 is it's probably like they look just
03:16 like us and be like yeah you're from
03:17 this tribe and that constellation you're
03:19 from this tribe that constellation now a
03:22 flipside of the coin is that as told to
03:26 us by von Braun's secretary he told her
03:30 they're already planning to do a fake
03:33 alien invasion and then then less than
03:35 like three or four years later because I
03:37 think von Braun died in 78 Reagan goes
03:40 up and does a speech and talks about
03:42 this alien invasion how we all unite
03:44 under one front then the History Channel
03:47 runs a special base with they had the
03:51 speech writers who were working for
03:53 Reagan at the time and they dramatized
03:55 up this big thing that he wanted to put
03:57 it in the speech and they didn't want to
03:58 put it in the speech and they had
04:01 basically agreed not to do it and he
04:02 walked out and did it I don't trust any
04:06 of those History Channel's do you I mean
04:09 it is [ __ ] revision revision revision
04:11 right but I think there's a bunch of
04:15 technical hurdles on the fake side that
04:20 will seem very fake to most of us which
04:22 is why they keep holding back so as we
04:25 wake up and as we would know what was
04:28 gonna you know what's fake and what's
04:30 not what's mandatory in order to believe
04:32 it their technology is slipping right
04:36 but they might have today might work in
04:38 1955 and then we mature 20 years they
04:43 only advanced five in terms of this
04:46 super complicated [ __ ] of trying to
04:48 fake you know UFOs and alien bodies and
04:51 you know alien people or whatever you
04:53 some hybrid human insect thing you know
04:56 let's talk about the real one because I
05:01 I had a dream the other day it's it
05:02 doesn't really necessarily kind of it's
05:05 related to this because it was
05:06 definitely an alien ship but you know
05:08 we've seen district 9 and we've seen
05:13 Independence Day both of which had giant
05:15 ships coming in and hovering over a city
05:19 what you think about it you think in
05:21 okay well if they're gonna move from
05:23 where they are to get to here and bring
05:26 enough people to make contact to defend
05:29 themselves because what the hell maybe
05:30 we have some ship that they don't know
05:32 and you know we Surprise them and then
05:36 they bring a big ship basically if
05:39 there's a rationale for a giant ship and
05:41 if you really think about size-wise a
05:44 ship the size of say San Francisco which
05:48 is not a ship Cisco Chicago about the
05:50 same size very densely populated but not
05:53 area wise gigantic kind of like New York
05:55 - but New York's actually pretty huge
05:57 with all boroughs but my dream was this
06:00 I was looking out over a cityscape I was
06:06 a little elevated but not too elevated
06:08 and there's this gigantic ship but I
06:10 mean it's probably Independence Day big
06:13 but maybe even a little bit bigger and
06:15 it's only just arrived and I'm looking
06:19 up this thing at you know we're all
06:21 gazing at this thing and wasn't really
06:24 like it I don't think anyone was
06:25 screaming anything like that but I was
06:27 like oh you know and then all of a
06:30 sudden there was kind of this electrical
06:33 thing that we all felt and the ship
06:38 we're back or just outside of the lip of
06:42 this thing and the ship completely
06:46 disables you could just tell whatever
06:49 little lights it had in it or whatever
06:52 which is very minor it just completely
06:54 shuts off and this thing just falls into
06:57 the ground
06:58 and I don't even know of my brain didn't
07:01 really process the fact that I would be
07:02 dead as a result of the falling I don't
07:04 know how far away I was in my dream but
07:07 it was my brain kept replaying it in my
07:11 head and I woke up or whatever and that
07:13 got me the idea for this episode of
07:15 thinking oh yeah like and so the
07:17 scenario in my mind in the dream was
07:19 that the government had a secret weapon
07:22 now which one I don't know the United
07:26 States could be another alien force but
07:29 it's really dumb to hit this thing like
07:31 an EMP you know wave just like in matrix
07:35 knocking it out we have a lot of EMP
07:37 technology of course weapons and
07:39 what-have-you
07:41 we just maybe started thinking like how
07:43 would they show up now as far as the
07:47 scenario of them wandering around in
07:48 space to kind of relax us maybe even
07:51 setting some you know radio
07:54 communications because what if they
07:57 can't speak our language with whatever
08:00 vocal cord system they have but they can
08:04 actually you know do a little bit of
08:06 well like two things they could do a
08:08 little bit of Morse code slash little
08:10 Ethernet packets or they could do a
08:12 little bit of a Speak & Spell
08:15 you know the Hawking voice talking to us
08:21 but think about this if they said hey
08:26 how you doing we come in peace and all
08:29 this other stuff this second they start
08:33 talking to us from afar we're gonna be
08:37 suspicious of their intent or at least
08:39 some people are gonna be like oh my god
08:41 that's all just a just a ruse man it's
08:44 just a it's a fake out they're gonna
08:45 come down eat us alive what have you
08:48 which I think we should talk about that
08:50 too so this thing starts happening and
08:54 we have to figure out how to do it now
08:55 if they showed up I think the
08:57 interesting thing about showing up it's
08:59 Kylie Missouri the state of Missouri in
09:02 America for those of you over over seas
09:05 or what have you they have a slogan
09:06 which is show me
09:09 you know show me what you mean show me
09:11 your intent show me you're my friend
09:13 and it's all basically results-driven
09:16 motto which is great so if they showed
09:19 up like in the Day the Earth Stood Still
09:21 1951 and it really you know really
09:25 formidable robot comes out but doesn't
09:26 touch anybody
09:27 and then this humanoid comes out and
09:30 he's in a little suit we think as the
09:34 movie you know he kind of stupidly
09:39 offers them this thing and then it does
09:42 the spiky doodad for whatever [ __ ]
09:44 reason it was supposed to do it was a
09:46 great it's a great story element 451 but
09:49 no intelligent being would be like okay
09:51 we're gonna get some looks like a gun
09:53 and we're gonna say it has a cure cancer
09:55 in it you know and then when they shot
09:57 it in the movie it's on the ground it's
09:59 all broken and they said he you know was
10:02 a Klaatu fact it was his name because
10:05 court was the robot Klaatu the dude was
10:08 like how and that thing was all the [ __ ]
10:10 that you needed man it could exalt all
10:12 your problems world hunger and cancer
10:14 and rectal dysfunction and it's like you
10:18 can't go back in the ship and make
10:19 another one there was only [ __ ] one
10:20 of them you know but now there's been
10:23 several films I don't remember every
10:25 single film's name but there's the one
10:26 where the egg shows up and just hovers
10:30 those egg and you know every country
10:32 over every land mass and of course
10:35 they're inside and they were very
10:37 different than us and needed a specific
10:39 atmosphere and so they're kind of like
10:42 you know we're gonna be here til you
10:44 guys chill out and we're gonna open a
10:47 door and you guys gonna figure out how
10:49 to come inside and then eventually we're
10:50 gonna make first contact and then they
10:53 were drawing in these beautiful kind of
10:55 so Dvorak kind of you know illustrations
10:59 I mean that alone that film had
11:01 scientifically one of the most brilliant
11:05 mechanisms I've ever seen in a film it
11:07 was just amazing how especially how they
11:09 translated it and all that stuff now the
11:11 film around that
11:13 premise was II it's okay but then
11:17 there's like a bunch of questions right
11:19 from us on this in let's just say again
11:22 like I love to do with this show is you
11:24 and I and everyone who watches deep
11:26 thoughts have been hired to come up with
11:31 sort of the plan and you know what
11:32 someone's done this probably ten dozen
11:36 times of like okay if they come in this
11:38 way we should do this they talk to us
11:39 like that we should do this what was
11:42 beautiful about the movie Close
11:44 Encounters of the Third Kind which is
11:45 just an absolute sci-fi Jim you know
11:49 it's like I should even say science
11:50 fiction Jim was there when they got to
11:53 Devil's Tower there was all this
11:57 protocol already put in place right I
11:59 mean they had the music It was as if
12:00 they had parsed every single element of
12:03 everything that they were told and they
12:04 were ten steps ahead and what they may
12:07 need and when they built the facility
12:09 behind the devils tower it was great I
12:15 mean they fixed it all up so we have to
12:17 be that kind of way as well now we have
12:22 to assume that they're gonna bring what
12:23 they need right they made through space
12:25 now for those of you are concerned that
12:27 it's interdimensional travel yeah
12:30 doesn't really matter for all intents
12:33 and purposes the other dimension would
12:34 be its own space and so yeah could be
12:39 completely different or what have you
12:41 now there was a show on TV called
12:44 Torchwood written by Russell Davies who
12:47 resurrected Doctor Who in 2005 and he
12:52 did he did an amazing job writing this
12:56 story it's it's a little um it has a
13:00 little a few PC things in it that I
13:02 think could have been removed from the
13:04 show but it's Britain's channel 4 I
13:08 think but anyway the third season has a
13:12 brilliant story and I mean when I
13:15 watched it I was so floored I remember
13:18 telling every single one of my friends
13:19 you gotta watch this some of the best TV
13:20 I've ever heard
13:21 or ever seen but the premise the set up
13:24 in the first episode without ruining
13:26 anything
13:27 for you is that they make this first
13:29 contact like city some pretty intense
13:32 communication and very quickly in the
13:35 first episode I think I'm going to leave
13:39 out some stuff so it's really fun for
13:41 you to watch it if you ever binge watch
13:43 it they need to get it on Netflix they
13:45 pretend like this is you know the
13:46 [ __ ] Star Wars trilogy and you gotta
13:48 buy it but BBC tends to do that way too
13:51 much and then they'll take Jim's like IT
13:55 Crowd and just throw it out there for
13:56 free it's just funny but they make
13:58 contact and just like jodie foster's
14:01 first contact movie they are instructing
14:04 us on how to build not a machine to get
14:07 to them but a machine or excuse me a
14:09 room and an atmosphere type so that they
14:12 can come and visit us and inhabit the
14:13 room and so the whole thing is amazing
14:17 the way that it shows up I'll let you
14:20 see it I thought that was cool
14:23 you know it's like here's how you would
14:24 build a chamber so we can be there and
14:26 then I guess they were using some
14:28 potentially interdimensional stuff to
14:30 get from the ship into the thing it's
14:33 interesting the value of this episode I
14:36 think would be if they try to fake it we
14:39 will have already done a little bit of
14:41 due diligence on our own minds as to
14:42 what would be necessary to accomplish
14:45 such a thing right to believe that it's
14:48 real obviously ships travelling in a way
14:51 that we don't travel with any of the
14:54 technology we have is step number one
14:57 then it would be the magnitude of the
15:00 ship itself if it is a tiny ship then we
15:04 can theorize that someone here on earth
15:07 could create some minor power source or
15:10 maybe some major power source of
15:12 zero-point energy and then some sort of
15:14 graviton bubble and it's gonna seem like
15:16 you know it's true anti-gravity but
15:18 maybe it's not big enough to put a crew
15:20 inside or maybe it's just big enough to
15:22 put like four or five people inside and
15:25 then you're starting to think well okay
15:26 we could probably do that here on earth
15:27 we got sketches all the way back to like
15:29 you know the time before Christ where
15:31 Hindus have what looks like spaceships
15:34 to me
15:35 written down yeah but if a ship shows up
15:39 the size of New York and it's up there
15:42 in the sky and it still moves very very
15:45 quickly then we're starting to think
15:48 okay I don't know if man has that much
15:52 technology to build something absolutely
15:54 gigantic because where would we have
15:57 built it something gigantic can't just
16:00 orbit in space because it would be well
16:04 one we can't go to the moon so how the
16:07 hell would we just build some big thing
16:09 up there in space right so I think that
16:13 once you get over a certain level
16:15 magnitude we start to kind of accept the
16:17 fact that okay this is not from this
16:19 planet and then you know there's the
16:21 whole classic Ark of are these people
16:27 friendly or are they not friendly do
16:31 they want to do like the twilight zone
16:33 to serve man do they want to trick us
16:35 into believing that they're here to help
16:37 us but they're gonna eat us in the end
16:38 don't know we would have to find you
16:42 know some logical questions to find out
16:47 you know it's almost corner them into
16:50 producing the proof that they are either
16:54 friend or foe now obviously the first
16:57 thing comes to everyone's mind
16:59 who thinks clearly is if they had the
17:03 tech to get here then they most likely
17:05 have the tech to completely destroy us
17:08 unless we start to think about maybe the
17:11 destroying process is not is
17:15 counterproductive to another goal
17:20 meaning let's say they don't wanna
17:24 scorch the earth because they want to
17:26 live here so they want any fires and one
17:28 explosions so they could release a gas
17:32 that's not gonna hurt them not gonna
17:34 hurt the plants
17:36 however maybe the chemistry of human
17:39 beings versus animal plant and mineral
17:42 it does affect the plant mineral and
17:44 animal and so like man we gotta figure
17:47 out how to make a genetic killer maybe
17:52 we're gonna be taken away maybe they
17:56 want to take us to another planet maybe
17:58 they wanna take us back to their planet
18:00 simply to be on display like the other
18:02 twilight zone I always think it's
18:04 interesting you know if you really
18:06 corner someone you go okay aliens land
18:09 they're legit and they're fairly nice
18:12 but they come up to you and they say we
18:16 would like to take you back to our home
18:18 planet for the rest of your life now
18:22 depending on how old you are that
18:23 question means something different for
18:24 your 20s 30s 40s 50s it's a completely
18:27 different thing if the older you are you
18:30 know it's interesting like if you had no
18:32 relatives and no friends I can see you
18:35 know going away is no problem as long as
18:39 you trust them not to kill you but what
18:41 if there's some weird kind of Hollywood
18:45 types and either they want to they want
18:50 to have sex with us or they want to eat
18:53 us some delicacy that could be - that
18:58 they're like predators and the holes
19:00 backstory were you know they're gonna
19:02 hunt us but they give us a head start
19:06 you know they're like okay here's the
19:09 deal man we're gonna come down and we're
19:12 gonna show you what you can do send a
19:14 dude down kills the few humans goes back
19:16 up this is okay we're gonna limit our
19:18 technology to your technology projectile
19:22 weapons blah blah blah and then you got
19:26 to run and they just dump all these
19:28 [ __ ] out on this room I think the big
19:31 question would be initially for me is
19:34 what would they look like
19:36 because the the first question I think
19:39 we because of Hollywood we've had our
19:41 minds sort of cleansed in most cases
19:46 which is if they're humanoid
19:47 they're definitely our size because why
19:51 now because it's hard to keep two
19:54 characters on in one frame when one of
19:56 them is 20 feet tall and the other ones
19:58 5 you know or whatever 510 to 64
20:01 whatever right if there could be hill
20:04 giants they could be gigantic but if
20:06 they were really small and then we would
20:09 have this false sense of security if
20:11 they're smaller you know your government
20:14 people could easily tell their soldiers
20:16 hey matter what size these people are
20:18 treat them as if they're very formidable
20:21 very powerful powerful that they can
20:22 kill you instantaneously be careful but
20:26 your average public like that great far
20:28 side cartoon which is a bunch of aliens
20:32 getting off a saucer and they're haen't
20:35 their heads are shaped like a hand and
20:37 they're saying hi to a farmer in the
20:39 field and the farmer is just about to
20:42 shake hands with them and it says
20:44 something at the bottom about this is
20:46 how you know World War 3 started with
20:49 the aliens you know you know one of the
20:53 things that they don't really talk about
20:54 but it's been portrayed in Star Trek's
20:57 lots of Star Trek's and some other
20:59 movies is what if they were fairly
21:01 humanoid maybe they're elven very smooth
21:06 and beautiful maybe even like gosh so
21:10 many of the aliens that have been in
21:11 Star Wars I really like them all with I
21:15 think it's the number two Star Wars with
21:18 Boba Fett or Jango Fett whatever it is
21:20 and it was that clone facility and
21:25 they're real tall lanky aliens but now
21:29 imagine that we start to cohabitate and
21:31 everything's great it would be you know
21:35 of guys just watching them use this
21:39 [ __ ] you know corona virus to crash
21:41 the economy
21:43 it would be interesting to see how it
21:45 would affect mankind's daily operations
21:48 so there's just a few here like a
21:50 thousand or something
21:52 among 7.5 billion all right you would be
21:56 probably more likely to meet an NBA
21:59 basketball player than you were to ever
22:02 meet these aliens but if they brought
22:05 down several hundred thousand and at
22:08 least there are major cities I would
22:10 imagine it would just couldn't resist
22:12 being in the rural areas as well then
22:15 you get a chance to meet him let's say
22:18 they brought Millions
22:21 hmm I'd changed things right it would be
22:25 interesting too because every time we
22:27 see a movie of these usually it's they
22:30 come down and meet the government first
22:31 the government you know just always has
22:33 the drop on them and then man is still
22:37 begging the government to touch the
22:38 aleene's right just like Richard
22:39 Dreyfuss and the other lady in Close
22:43 Encounters but what if they were more
22:46 ubiquitous and more available to us
22:49 they're not among us prior to this event
22:52 they simply stand in Times Square they
22:57 stand there's no real central place in
23:00 Los Angeles Union Square in San
23:02 Francisco wherever they're around and
23:06 then mankind gets to try to communicate
23:10 with them in unique ways because there's
23:12 no one breathing down your neck about
23:13 how to say hi you know how to ask them a
23:17 question maybe they know English to a
23:20 certain point and then don't know
23:22 certain other things maybe they know
23:24 English but they don't know our cultures
23:25 and because New England is completely
23:28 different than Alabama the New York
23:31 thing California the Washington state
23:34 they're sitting there kind of
23:36 dumbfounded about certain things
23:39 probably moving slowly communicating
23:41 slowly because that's usually how you
23:43 avoid a catastrophe right when you're
23:45 backing up your car I always teach
23:48 people I teach how to drive I say try to
23:51 backup so slow if you're in a precarious
23:53 situation parking lot for the first time
23:56 or whatever that if you bump a human
23:58 body you barely leave a bruise and then
24:02 when you build up your confidence and
24:04 other indicators you can move a little
24:06 bit quicker but now there would be if
24:10 they showed up let's say in one of those
24:11 independence day vehicles big giant
24:14 spaceship then we have sort of two
24:19 worlds that have met in a way that we
24:21 really don't talk about it it's
24:23 portrayed in the movies even when they
24:25 extended the ending of Close Encounters
24:27 which was kind of a bummer in my opinion
24:31 they leaving it as a mystery at the end
24:33 about what Richard Dreyfuss saw when he
24:35 went to the spaceship at the end was
24:38 awesome then when they showed us it was
24:40 kind of like it wasn't bad it was
24:42 actually a really good interpretation of
24:44 what you would think was insights the
24:46 artists did a great job Richard
24:49 obviously did a great job but I think
24:52 was a little bit better to leave it as a
24:53 mystery and all of us kind of wonder
24:55 because once they solved the mystery you
24:57 no longer wondering the movie loses its
24:59 enchanted nature we never saw the inside
25:01 of ET ship alright so we can sit forever
25:04 and think about what that egg thing had
25:06 inside of it
25:08 but their ship would be there big enough
25:11 for us to visit obviously we wouldn't be
25:14 able to visit without their permission
25:16 but you say we figure out a way to
25:19 communicate we touch yourselves and then
25:23 we you know we draw a picture of us
25:27 going onto their ship and then Carolla
25:30 line back down to earth so you know I
25:32 don't want to go with you and then there
25:35 would be this fascinating thing with
25:37 sitting there talking to an alien I mean
25:39 if you were to write the film you'd have
25:43 like perhaps a kid in the Midwest who's
25:45 never you know he's he lives in a mobile
25:49 home or whatever he knows about tech he
25:51 sees the Internet
25:53 there's a couple of nice cars in town
25:54 most of our pickups all covered dirt and
25:58 now he's sitting in front of a stainless
25:59 steel person you know so I'm a lien and
26:03 I don't be made of steel but just really
26:05 clean and really you know put together
26:08 and let's say the dudes like eight feet
26:11 tall really lanky or something or woman
26:14 they're asexual and you're trying to
26:17 communicate back and forth trying to
26:19 teach them language if they can speak
26:20 maybe it's telepathic and you know it's
26:24 just sitting there observing this being
26:28 from another placement just think about
26:31 how dreamy that would feel it would feel
26:35 like you're having a lucid dream that
26:37 you've imagined this being right and you
26:40 know they've got tech you know that most
26:45 likely I mean this is a little bit
26:47 Hollywood because we have plenty of
26:49 people on earth they don't know a damn
26:51 thing about what's going on you know was
26:54 it one of my friend's mother's in high
26:59 school thought if she drove the car
27:02 backwards that put gas back in the tank
27:04 I'm not even joking
27:06 I even think they caught her doing it
27:08 they're like what are you doing
27:09 just putting cast back in the day so we
27:12 have those two but we have to assume
27:14 that if you're elected to go to earth
27:16 from another planet or another dimension
27:18 or whatever that you have some goods
27:21 yeah some really decent knowledge about
27:24 technology people places and things all
27:27 that kind of stuff
27:28 and then it would be trying to figure
27:30 out okay you know like that conversation
27:33 probably try to exchange some sort of
27:36 reference of you know what do I call you
27:37 what do you call your people you know if
27:41 they have really good English then we
27:42 can really have a fast developing
27:44 conversation you ask them about their
27:47 world what's not really portrayed in
27:51 most of the Hollywood stuff is a
27:54 sophisticated version of what I'm about
27:56 to say and not some sort of new chicks
27:59 from outer space kind of movie but to
28:02 say you know do you have a way of
28:04 showing me a picture of your world
28:06 we've got these things called cellphones
28:08 and you bring up a picture you have
28:10 anything like this and see if they're
28:12 bringing some hardware with them maybe
28:14 they don't maybe they just look at you
28:16 and they mind-meld you and poof you've
28:21 got this picture in your brain but we we
28:25 go through a litany of questions right
28:27 would be what do you eat do you sleep
28:29 how old do you live we rotate around
28:32 this and we you know if you know the
28:34 rotational pattern of this planet around
28:36 that Sun over there then that's what we
28:39 call one year if you could
28:41 reverse-engineer that to your timetable
28:42 how many of these rotations do you
28:45 survive before you call yourself an
28:49 adult's before you have procreates
28:51 before you go on a mission like this
28:53 before you pass away do you pass away
28:56 how old are you right now
28:58 how far away is your planning you know
29:00 all those really interesting questions
29:01 to get orientated so you can have some
29:04 form of instinct about the other person
29:06 we do this as human beings if we travel
29:09 around the world and if you've never
29:12 traveled in a rural and literally been
29:13 in a place where no one speaks your
29:15 language it's really different and
29:19 that's why a lot of couples get married
29:20 from different worlds here in the ice
29:23 here in the earth I should say the
29:26 United States people will go over and
29:28 like about right mile writing teacher he
29:30 said he married a woman in Italy and
29:32 they were together for two years and in
29:35 two years they barely could communicate
29:38 with language he was better at Italian
29:40 than she was at English
29:42 and he I think he liked it that way I've
29:46 got other friends who went to Mexico and
29:47 literally learned Spanish while they
29:49 were down there and got married brought
29:51 the women back up
29:53 but there's just something luring about
29:55 having remember I told you guys that
29:57 were pattern based beings we like new
29:59 patterns so part of the sociology and
30:03 psychology of human beings being
30:06 compulsively romantic is that you've now
30:09 captured a treasure where everything
30:12 about this person is different than
30:14 every other person that you know from
30:16 your area so it's great to go over and
30:18 there you go from Finland or or you know
30:21 Australia if you're not from there or
30:24 whatever you know tell me about your
30:27 life it's always gonna be a new
30:28 interesting story but now imagine this
30:33 little element to the story now if like
30:37 right now we are being controlled by
30:38 bankers mainly right we call them other
30:43 names but that's really the mechanism by
30:46 which they control us right they can pay
30:48 off someone to threaten your life then
30:51 they got you but think about this can I
30:54 go to area 51 the answer is no can I go
30:58 to wright-patterson Air Force Base and
31:00 look all around there Research Center no
31:02 skunk works
31:03 no NASA no JPL no now imagine that
31:08 you're sitting in front of a beam across
31:11 from you in your living room
31:14 and they have more knowledge than every
31:17 single one of these facilities on earth
31:20 they're the great equalizer because
31:24 they'll answer because they have no
31:26 philosophy that something should be
31:29 coveted something should be hidden
31:32 now they obviously know that you have a
31:34 limited amount of capacity to understand
31:37 their technology but maybe you're not
31:39 asking for the schematics on how to
31:40 build it you just want to ask does this
31:43 exist and again I think I said in the
31:46 previous episode imagine asking that
31:48 being thus God exists and see what they
31:53 say because wow you know that's
31:55 something that we come up with as human
31:57 beings this higher intelligence I can
32:00 understand if through you know millions
32:04 of years of being alive they've sort of
32:07 cleanse themselves of it so it doesn't
32:10 exist as an imperative and so maybe
32:12 they've forgotten the old concept of a
32:14 god hmm now again asking them if God
32:19 exists doesn't mean you're gonna get the
32:20 answer it's just you're gonna get their
32:22 opinion of the concept now I've actually
32:26 listened to and read several takes on
32:30 that question being asked to supposedly
32:32 surviving aliens and I think in all
32:35 cases that came back that yes there is a
32:39 higher being but I think most of those
32:42 are probably made-up knows I think the
32:46 other mindfuck might be that if they
32:48 landed and they were completely human
32:51 looking but larger and stronger not
32:55 Superman just bigger beings you know
32:58 like our average WWF wrestler would be
33:01 one of their children but they're 15 to
33:05 20 feet tall they're the Nephilim or
33:08 whatever that is rumored to have existed
33:10 on North America which is the Native
33:13 Americans said yeah there used to be
33:14 giant humans here and here's all their
33:16 remains and of course the Smithsonian
33:17 takes them all loses them you know cuz
33:20 I'm in a basement somewhere
33:23 trying to you know scrub the history
33:26 that there's anything to hope for other
33:28 than our financial leaders to provide
33:31 [ __ ] guidance for us right but if they
33:34 did show up and they're totally talking
33:36 to us in our language it is as if let's
33:40 just arbitrarily pick something they're
33:42 totally cool folks and then you kind of
33:47 maybe get a creeper feeling from them
33:48 because you're like wow this is a little
33:50 too much like me and Wow if they made a
33:52 decision to do harm because of their
33:57 formidable size and maybe technology
33:59 they have to protect themselves we would
34:01 be screwed but it would be interesting
34:04 that if they came smooth like a like a
34:07 grey alien or something we might feel
34:10 completely secure for the unfounded
34:13 inverse reason they look like Mickey
34:16 Mouse how can they possibly you know
34:19 that is you know harm I guess the
34:23 question too because I mean an episode
34:24 I'm very proud of called the alien
34:25 promise which is what does man think
34:28 they're gonna get out of aliens which
34:30 drives the mythos of aliens existing in
34:33 the first place
34:33 besides outside of any facts of seeing
34:36 you know UFOs and paintings or anything
34:38 like that not saying those aren't real
34:41 but we have a mythos that they're gonna
34:44 come and save us and there is no matter
34:47 how enchanted your life is you know what
34:51 my mom was a little kid she said that it
34:55 was pretty common and she had it to the
34:57 little girls would fantasize because of
35:00 fictional things on TV and movies that
35:03 they were actually as an example maybe
35:06 one of them was a princess and they've
35:08 been hidden away from the kingdom and
35:10 these parents that they have aren't the
35:13 real parents or the you know caregivers
35:16 and then eventually the king and queen
35:18 are gonna show up and pick him up and
35:19 take him back to their castle whatever
35:22 right I think that's kind of interesting
35:25 you know for me when I was a probably
35:28 eight or nine years old I was a huge
35:29 kiss fan I used to think about because
35:32 kiss meets the Phantom came out which
35:34 made them literally out of his [ __ ]
35:36 world man I was a little teeny kids is
35:38 completely impressionable and it was
35:42 like they came from some other place and
35:43 it's funny too because I never really
35:45 got the sense that gene Simmons was sort
35:48 of a devil guy it never bothered me it
35:50 was like I didn't get devil out of I
35:52 just got and makeup and it was kind of
35:53 cool and he was a cool protector you
35:56 know which is probably his true nature
35:58 but I remember fantasize wrong my own
36:02 makeup and I kind of joined the band and
36:04 I look like this you know or I'll take
36:06 off when next time we leave this world
36:08 or whatever was very short-lived but it
36:11 did exist you know that moment of my
36:13 life it's fun to look back at it and go
36:16 wow and I was totally buying that you
36:19 know yeah I think we all assumed that if
36:23 you had a big ship you would have little
36:24 ships and this is how they would you
36:26 know just like a the metaphor of a boat
36:28 even the ships that came over for me
36:32 from Europe to North America discovered
36:36 the Native Americans here they usually
36:37 had like smaller boats they would get
36:39 into at least one it's really big and
36:41 they lowered down everyone gets into it
36:43 and you go out to the coast you get out
36:44 of it and that kind of thing so they
36:47 would have some form of that if they
36:49 didn't have that again teleportation
36:52 technology but you know I have to say
36:54 like that whole Star Trek atomizing your
36:59 form and then projecting it down to the
37:01 ground my take on this is because we
37:04 have a soul in my opinion you can't just
37:08 analyze the body and move it because the
37:11 soul would be abandoned from the body
37:13 because we can't touch that energy at
37:16 all so it doesn't mean you can't create
37:20 some sort of teleportation technology or
37:22 platform but what you would have to do
37:23 in my opinion is hope to god that the
37:30 ether winds that you can control would
37:33 literally create some sort of you know
37:35 wormhole between some bent space between
37:38 where you are and where you need to be
37:39 and they could bend it and so you
37:42 actually are physically traveling
37:44 through this hole in a way that doesn't
37:45 kill you or suffocates you or crush
37:49 or whatever and then your soul is
37:51 naturally goes with your body maybe
37:54 that's naive but I think Stephen King
37:57 read a little short story in his Bachman
38:01 book days where he was talking about
38:03 teleportation door jam and the mice that
38:07 went through kept dying on the other
38:09 side and for me it was they were just it
38:12 was like there's still a heartbeat
38:13 there's still blood vessels you know
38:16 pumping and stuff even if you could get
38:17 it to the other side but if without a
38:19 soul it's just gonna basically go feral
38:22 and die let's go people take bath salts
38:25 I think what's truly going on there is
38:26 you're losing your connection with your
38:29 soul and so what's left is this feral
38:32 being that's that's rousing it people
38:35 and you're not normal because your soul
38:37 is gone or you're absolutely at the
38:40 tidbit of connection through your silver
38:43 cord or whatever it is to keep your soul
38:45 intact because obviously you do come
38:46 back after the bath salts we're off
38:48 hopefully if you've ever seen the movie
38:52 altered states and then watch someone
38:53 take bath salts its if there's a
38:57 correlation there between becoming this
38:59 primitive eighth man and taking bath
39:02 salts but then the next question would
39:05 be if you were able to make contact with
39:07 this being and you know let's say that
39:11 you get the the deluxe package man you
39:14 are able to communicate that you have
39:16 access to them on a daily basis which it
39:19 would be one of the questions would be
39:20 how often you're gonna see these folks
39:22 because you could you imagine the
39:24 euphoria of them sitting across from you
39:26 and your own home
39:28 you've got the privilege of talking to
39:30 them for you know 12 hours straight
39:33 and what if they told you at the
39:36 beginning of the conversation okay well
39:38 I'm just gonna tell you 12 hours from
39:40 now I gotta go and talk to someone else
39:44 no one in particular but I got to talk
39:46 to someone else that's kind of how our
39:47 missions set up and then you know what
39:50 we're probably not gonna ever see each
39:52 other again you might see someone else
39:54 but you're not gonna see me again and
39:56 that weird thing of it's sort of when
39:59 you meet her celebrity there's that
40:01 feeling that realization
40:03 that you're in the room with the
40:04 celebrity and you're so when you admire
40:08 anyone else's definition of a celebrity
40:11 could be just someone down the street
40:12 you think is really cool but you've
40:14 never had access to or a pretty girl
40:15 pretty guy or whatever right but it's
40:18 gonna end and so you're trying to save
40:20 her every moments you're trying to
40:22 harvest out of the conversation
40:24 everything you possibly can which in one
40:27 way this is why this episode has a
40:28 little bit of value because we would
40:30 premeditate all of our most important
40:33 questions because your most important
40:34 questions might be different than my
40:36 most important questions you know
40:39 scientists might be going for cures
40:41 might be going for invention theories
40:46 one of the most beautiful things was in
40:49 the The Day the Earth Stood Still 1951
40:52 movie here in the United States was that
40:55 there was a Jewish professor who they
40:56 tried to pump up like an Einstein go see
41:00 my episode 9 sandwiches and he solved an
41:06 equation
41:06 he changed the guy's thinking he was
41:09 like well you know what this won't work
41:10 it was really a cool scene because the
41:13 professor wasn't at his office the
41:16 little boy took the alien who looks
41:19 fully human into this guy's laboratory
41:22 or whatever's like his room in this huge
41:25 equation and the guy picks up the chalk
41:28 and he has this assistant to the
41:32 scientist this woman is like okay what
41:36 are you doing what are you doing he's
41:37 like oh he's got this wrong you know
41:38 he's thinking about it the wrong way
41:39 he's almost there he's almost got it and
41:42 so he starts a racing [ __ ] and changing
41:44 the algorithm on the page I mean on the
41:46 blackboard and this woman is like about
41:48 to have a coronary because she thinks oh
41:51 my god he just erased you know a formula
41:53 it's been on there for years and then he
41:57 the what he did was he fixed the formula
42:00 then he left his phone number where he's
42:03 staying
42:03 and said as soon as he sees that he's
42:06 gonna want to know who did it and come
42:08 and get me
42:08 and that's was his calling card just to
42:11 fix the formula I mean just brilliant
42:13 men right
42:15 now the other thing too is it's one
42:19 thing to know language you know phonetic
42:23 linear language right speaking and it's
42:28 another thing to be able to mind-meld
42:30 through like a telepathy imagine me and
42:34 if those of you know me after this show
42:37 imagine me trying to ask one of these
42:39 dudes about ether well ether is a very
42:43 esoteric word maybe they've studied us
42:45 enough but I mean could you imagine them
42:48 trying to learn English and then they
42:49 only you you know they learn the most
42:51 popular words but because we don't talk
42:53 about ether it's been this hung up
42:54 science they may not know the word but
43:00 if we're communicating through symbols
43:02 in our minds they're gonna get it right
43:04 away so if I said okay is there ether in
43:07 the universe you know I'm projecting
43:10 this concept up their mind and they're
43:12 like oh yeah that's how we got here men
43:14 and then we could have that advanced
43:16 conversation and they could take us to
43:17 the next level the ultimate thing would
43:21 be to say you know not the ultimate
43:23 ultimate but one of the cool things
43:25 would be you know can you use things in
43:27 my house to build something that would
43:29 give us the propulsion system that you
43:32 have and I just think it would be
43:35 unbelievable to have them show up as an
43:39 amass of authority in all things and
43:41 nothing is coveted nothing is hidden
43:43 right like I said and then we're sitting
43:46 there going the game is over for these
43:49 [ __ ] the alien promise arrives maybe
43:53 it's a cure to cancer maybe it's secure
43:54 the starvation will peace all that kind
43:57 of stuff but now mankind can be mankind
44:00 we can be free and I want you to put a
44:02 little footnote in your mind about do
44:05 you really need the alien invasion or
44:07 alien presence
44:08 alien visit for mankind to simply all
44:11 have the same thought of like you know
44:13 I'm sick of your [ __ ] you know what this
44:16 is dead I have it's all in your [ __ ]
44:18 head
44:18 I probably 10 bucks I paid you back 10
44:20 bucks we're done with this relationship
44:22 you don't get extra money we're done all
44:25 right a little bit but not much
44:27 and it's like oh they lose all the power
44:30 in the world just immediately the
44:33 greatest invention we could ever make on
44:34 this planet would be to give all human
44:36 beings the same thought in symbol love
44:39 kindness perseverance of the human race
44:43 and then to let them know that their
44:47 enemies are the Baker's their enemies
44:50 are these lying politicians and use
44:53 corporate coke brother kind of people
44:55 that are just out to [ __ ] watch the
44:57 world burn right now let's play the
45:00 second half of the equation here of this
45:04 first scenario because we're gonna get
45:06 to the fake in just a second here well
45:09 what if they were only here for a year
45:13 and they didn't effectively shut off the
45:17 government because they don't want to
45:19 hurt us right because they don't know
45:21 exactly what all the dependencies are
45:22 you know if you're living on
45:23 unemployment and then they kill it you
45:25 know and you're starving to death or
45:27 something so it gonna leave kind of the
45:28 government in place but they're having
45:29 all these conversations with us but what
45:33 if they left after 365 days and they're
45:37 like we won't be back for another
45:38 thousand years or hundred years even but
45:42 a lot of us are coming back like a whole
45:44 bunch of us are coming back now you have
45:48 your your corrupt intelligence agents
45:53 which you know there's only a few
45:57 absolutely black corrupt folks I wanna
46:04 set up because the black hats versus
46:05 white hats right and so they know let's
46:10 just say that you talked to one of them
46:11 maybe they were even he's dropping on
46:14 the conversation using tech we don't
46:15 even know satellite tech we've never
46:18 heard of planes that can listen to homes
46:20 but they're trying to harvest all the
46:22 conversations and here we are asking all
46:24 this stuff not knowing because they
46:27 didn't start the conversation off with
46:28 that little piece of information that
46:30 they're gonna go away for enough years
46:32 that everyone on earth is going to be
46:34 dead
46:35 maybe a baby born to the day that they
46:37 arrived will still be alive in a hundred
46:38 years so the government the corrupt
46:44 folks simply say deep state well we can
46:48 do anything we want to these people who
46:50 talk to these aliens because [ __ ] by the
46:53 time they get back we're long gone right
46:56 imagine a George Soros worried about
46:58 anything right he's been in the news a
47:02 lot lately and again I still haven't
47:04 seen live footage of him but I'm
47:06 assuming he's still I don't know the
47:09 rumor he died well he definitely
47:11 disappeared after October 2018 we hadn't
47:16 seen him for a really long time he's
47:17 come coming out saying Mark Zuckerberg
47:19 should be fired or whatever could be his
47:21 corporations and that could be him that
47:23 I think people have seen him I think
47:24 anyway so anyway now you're a target of
47:29 the deep state because they want to
47:30 harvests well anyone harvest all the
47:32 information that you've ever heard -
47:34 they don't want you to tell anyone else
47:36 anything that you told everything that
47:39 you were told because they want to put
47:40 the planet back under wraps and then you
47:44 go up they kill you they keep you for as
47:47 long as they think you're valuable then
47:48 kill you and that would suck even if the
47:53 aliens said look was you know if you
47:54 heard any of our people or any the
47:56 people we talked to they'll be held to
47:58 pay but we'll see you in a hundred years
48:00 and they're like okay man you guys
48:02 didn't do really good math about you
48:05 know how long we lived right so if you
48:09 get a chance you want to ask them for
48:10 like a little little medallion little
48:12 ring or something that completely
48:14 protects you physically now obviously
48:17 we've had a lot of conversations about
48:18 how this would change the way that we
48:21 perceive man-made God's right if they
48:24 showed up and spend some time with us
48:28 and really to the degree they spent time
48:32 with us I think people like Jesus would
48:34 melt away
48:35 I really do I think that we would see
48:37 ourselves in a different light and go
48:39 see what we did I mean it's not bad we
48:43 just we had to figure out and sort out
48:45 some things
48:46 religion protected the bond between a
48:48 man and a woman protected a village from
48:50 having an [ __ ] run around killing
48:51 everybody because there were some laws
48:53 again the Bible and all the Bible's of
48:56 different religions prior to them
48:59 arriving would be
49:01 that machine to give everyone the same
49:04 thought all right that's what the Bible
49:06 does if you believe in Christianity it
49:08 gives you the Ten Commandments which is
49:10 actually Old Testament right so lots of
49:13 religions have the Old Testament but you
49:16 know some people don't want to be held
49:17 down by anything and so they reject at
49:19 all now sometimes when you meet certain
49:23 people in your life they are so special
49:26 and if you have a good connection with
49:28 them at any point in time and you never
49:30 had a bad exit right
49:32 you will feel special for the rest of
49:34 your life that you had a chance to meet
49:36 those people and in a way you will be
49:38 validated for whatever it is that you
49:42 prize most about yourself right because
49:45 usually well it depends on who you meet
49:49 of course but the more sophisticated and
49:50 smart they are and they share their time
49:52 with you then you'll just be validating
49:57 that way right so you may actually have
50:00 this big if they didn't come get you
50:02 which they would you'd have this big
50:04 uptick and your personal space if they
50:09 did indeed leave now that the thing they
50:12 don't talk about a lot okay is that what
50:16 if they left a big delegation here did
50:20 take the ship back and the government
50:25 and these aliens disagreed about
50:28 something big the deep state you know
50:32 rolls out all the red carpets and the
50:35 good linen has a little din shindig with
50:39 a little dinner and they explain to the
50:43 aliens well you know what it's taken us
50:44 a thousands and thousands of years to
50:47 eclipse the law of the jungle and you
50:50 know we just have our ways and we like
50:53 our ways they're lying to them of course
50:54 and of course they're not stupid but it
50:58 would be interesting to see how would
51:00 the aliens and intellectual conversation
51:04 disagree with the deep state how would
51:08 that go well we're gonna need to you
51:10 know go get all of the people that you
51:12 talk to and quarantine them away from
51:14 humanity
51:16 what we need to you know I mean in you
51:18 know [ __ ] unless the aliens are watching
51:20 no kill us and so maybe the aliens are
51:22 like I don't think so that'd be awesome
51:26 right they stand up for the human race I
51:29 don't think so
51:30 things are gonna change we've seen this
51:32 pattern before we know who you are maybe
51:36 they don't necessarily have a good and
51:38 evil sort of metaphor in their mind but
51:41 they definitely have productive
51:43 non-productive but it'd be interesting I
51:47 don't believe I've ever seen that
51:48 portrayed in story on any fictional
51:51 sense in any fictional sense so could
51:56 you imagine you know at that point the
51:59 deep state goes oh yeah well we're gonna
52:01 show you what we've got you know they
52:02 start yanking out all these weapons and
52:04 and I will tell you I mention this a
52:06 long time ago but I will tell you it one
52:08 more time because we've got a whole new
52:10 audience at this stage I had a good
52:14 friend of mine he is very brilliant in
52:19 the video game industry he's he's a very
52:22 famous person for creating a very famous
52:24 franchise and I'm at my buddy said Meads
52:27 house the gathering might be in the
52:31 Kentucky Derby party we usually had but
52:33 regardless he was there and he and I are
52:35 sitting out back by the pool and these
52:38 chairs and we have a conversation we
52:40 just met and so like when you meet
52:42 through CID and you know sister
52:44 immediately friends it's just like I
52:46 know you're cool because you're here you
52:48 know he and I start talking and we start
52:51 talking about the moon thing and he he
52:55 said you know well you know I'm still
52:56 not this was like God 10 years ago but
52:59 he said you know I'm still in the fence
53:00 about whether or not we win and I'm like
53:01 and we didn't go but I I'm not gonna I'm
53:04 not here to pressure you either way he
53:07 says why I know that aliens exist and
53:10 that the government knows that aliens
53:12 exist I was like oh that's interesting
53:14 coming from this dude no I'm listening
53:18 and he said well one of the first things
53:21 I ever did before I got in video games
53:22 was I did 3d modeling and 3d animation
53:26 in the late 80s I was one of the first
53:28 guys that did
53:29 on his behalf repeating what he said to
53:31 me I said okay I'm waiting how does this
53:35 connect to aliens and the government he
53:38 said well I used to do renderings for
53:41 the government and he said in one
53:43 project he was on he was tasked with
53:48 modeling a missile silo that had been
53:51 retrofitted to be a plasma cannon and he
53:56 said I've modeled it which mean I knew
53:58 all the pieces and parts
54:00 I know exactly what all these injectors
54:02 were apparently it's it's a situation
54:06 where they inject a bunch of gas into
54:10 the center and then they light it
54:12 somehow and it blasts this huge beam
54:15 into space and what he was trying to
54:18 tell me because if you ever seen that
54:19 footage from the Space Shuttle where all
54:21 these beams are coming up from the earth
54:23 as these discs sort of organic disc
54:26 creatures sort of come down to the
54:28 atmosphere and as soon as the beam comes
54:30 at him they turn and they go away I said
54:33 yeah I seen it and he goes well he was
54:37 that's a weapon to keep them at bay I
54:40 was like well my brain I'm thinking well
54:43 you can't point a missile site look much
54:45 for enemy it's a what kind of degrees of
54:48 motion could you get out of that thing
54:49 rate be pretty hard to kill a
54:53 home-invasion person if your gun is
54:55 pointed you know straight up from the
54:56 ground so could you walk over that hole
54:58 right there but he said that he actually
55:02 visited the place and he said that I
55:06 believe that's the case because he said
55:08 he had a conversation with one of the
55:10 guys cuz he's like he said it's good she
55:13 said two things that were utterly
55:14 fascinating he said one all the
55:16 personnel in this
55:18 old retired missile silo were just
55:23 sweating bullets and he said I was like
55:26 really could barely describe dig'
55:28 because he said they were just looking
55:30 like this might be the last day on earth
55:32 like this thing is so state-of-the-art
55:35 so cutting edge and bleeding edge that
55:39 it could kill if your buddy l1 shot
55:42 and so this oh you said that was the
55:46 climate inside this facility and then he
55:48 asked what the hell's this thing for and
55:52 he said one of the guys didn't didn't
55:55 say as much as you might imagine but he
55:57 he just pointed up there he goes it's
56:00 it's a weapon I would say this is a
56:03 weapon and he goes a weapon against who
56:04 and he he says them and he points up at
56:08 the sky and he says this guy is like
56:11 like be kind of between so stress he's
56:15 gonna have a heart attack and sort of
56:18 sort of cry
56:19 you can oh like I don't really want to
56:21 be here sort of you know personality so
56:24 I thought that was pretty amazing again
56:27 this is why I made this show cuz I've
56:28 been privileged to talk to all these
56:30 people again I don't understand the the
56:34 fixed thing but maybe that's just a
56:36 facility to test it out and they can
56:38 miniaturize it put her in a can and put
56:40 it in a plane put it in missile hell I
56:42 don't know never heard anything else
56:44 about it the IQ of this guy that I was
56:48 talking to his couldn't be any higher
56:50 period so slip over and take a new take
56:54 at this fake invasion fake invasion like
57:00 I said earlier in this episode is going
57:01 to be increasingly more difficult
57:04 as time passes but we know that there
57:09 are different groups of people on this
57:11 planet or at least you should so the
57:16 requirements to convince people that
57:18 this is occurring is gonna vary
57:22 dramatically and let me give you some
57:24 demographics right Peru the tribes in
57:30 Peru crawling around in the forest
57:32 probably not so much because they
57:35 probably already think half the [ __ ]
57:36 that flies over their head is the same
57:37 thing ok let's talk about Africa well
57:46 depends on how much a particular tribe
57:48 has had contact most tribes have had
57:51 full contact with the outside world but
57:55 it's based on their religions maybe it's
57:57 their gods they think they're seeing
57:59 again according to david icke you know
58:01 there's several African tribes / nations
58:05 that believe that they're from space
58:08 Zulu is supposed to be supposed to mean
58:10 people from space don't know if that's
58:14 true don't speak zoo but what would be
58:16 the point of a fake invasion the fake
58:19 invasion is to huddle the masses
58:22 together now
58:24 let me ask you do you think because I
58:29 would say China is gonna be pretty much
58:33 considered I mean they're a communist
58:35 country which I think almost permanently
58:37 removes their classification being a
58:40 first world country right the most
58:42 primitive way to run a country is a
58:45 communist II country right so if you
58:48 want to brag about your intelligence but
58:51 you answer to a communist regime and
58:53 sorry you're negating your the whole
58:56 argument it's like come back when you
58:58 figure out I'd be free right anyone can
59:01 heard people into a communist tea you
59:05 know envelope the trick it takes true
59:08 intelligence in my opinion to live in a
59:10 free society to acknowledge and become
59:13 so self-aware that you realize you
59:15 actually have a demand for freedom
59:18 and no level of control over your head
59:20 should be accepted which is why the
59:22 Great Awakening is happening and we're
59:23 all even in the first world countries
59:26 which of which we have more freedoms in
59:28 most areas of the world we're getting
59:30 rid of all of it we're like [ __ ] off
59:32 right
59:33 we'll handle ourselves but the fake
59:37 invasion is all about hurting the first
59:41 world masses because we're the ones that
59:43 are causing problems for these [ __ ]
59:46 I think that they actually were born
59:48 better than us and that they can control
59:50 us they should be able to control us you
59:54 know the irony of the statement is that
59:57 they do in many ways control us
59:59 completely and that's what's frustrating
60:02 you know being in this world and being
60:04 controlled but feeling like you're a
60:06 free man or a free woman it's a bit like
60:10 being on a plane where you have the
60:13 person with the least amount of aviation
60:16 knowledge being the pilot copilot and
60:19 navigator and so the plane is destined
60:22 to crash
60:23 simply because idiots are driving the
60:26 plane at least idiots in the room of
60:29 flying the plane so most of us say I
60:32 don't want to be flying put this thing
60:34 on the ground get the smartest person to
60:37 land it I'm getting at this point and
60:39 I'm never going back up in this
60:40 apparatus called
60:41 you know petrol dollar or whatever you
60:44 want to call it right the metaphor for
60:45 the plane itself so the beautiful
60:48 balance is that because we do have so
60:51 much science fiction being incubated
60:54 every single year right war the World
60:56 Series I think is just debuting on
60:59 Amazon Prime very excited to see it
61:00 hopefully it's good we got expanse you
61:03 have whatever catastrophe that's
61:07 happening in the Star Trek realm today
61:09 then you have all the old classics you
61:12 know I have to say that in terms of per
61:16 capita human education on what it would
61:19 be like to be with aliens Star Trek
61:23 blows them all away every single
61:25 franchise pales in comparison to you
61:29 know 67 to 69 and then
61:32 87 to 2005 they parsed this 26 episodes
61:38 per season first an average Star Wars or
61:41 sorry Star Trek show from 87 to 2005
61:45 that's huge
61:48 so for them to convince us imagine the
61:52 scenario I gave you just a second ago
61:54 where you actually got to meet dealing
61:56 instead of them being coveted away from
61:58 you you saw a ship that was so large
62:01 that you can't fathom I can't fathom
62:05 mankind in any covert queue a non
62:09 [ __ ] secret space program being able
62:13 to create a ship let alone a dozen of
62:16 them the size of New York I don't think
62:19 we can do it and hide them and keep them
62:21 out there right so the beautiful thing
62:24 is I truly believe they can't do it
62:28 today the bummer is what if they did
62:35 some math and they tested some areas
62:38 tested it however they test people they
62:40 fly one over a field in Kansas if I went
62:44 over a field in Italy Flavin revealed in
62:46 China Africa South America and they were
62:50 able to realize well you know what a
62:53 good ninety percent of people believe
62:55 that what we have today is actually real
62:57 when we showed them the weird you know
62:59 insectoid humans that we have hybrid in
63:01 some you know island of dr. Moreau they
63:04 totally bought it even though they can't
63:06 speak English they totally bought it but
63:10 it would be possible for them to create
63:11 a different species of being through
63:14 this hybrid ink technology and teach
63:17 them a completely new language as well
63:20 as English so you have all these weird
63:23 people show up fully human base or I
63:27 should say earth based life beings and
63:29 they look at each other and they're
63:31 talking is completely different language
63:33 good good happen I guess if you could
63:38 get inside the vehicle let's say they
63:40 made one that was 100 foot across some
63:45 sort of disc and it's got enough room in
63:47 there you can go take a ride in it and
63:49 you're actually riding in it and you're
63:51 looking around the room and boy it does
63:53 look alien like and these beings are
63:56 kind of strange and you know they take
64:00 every flat earth they're up there and
64:01 show them the globe there it is yeah
64:04 what else you want to see this thing can
64:06 also go at the bottom of the ocean you
64:07 know whatever you experience all these
64:09 things you've never experienced before
64:10 but it is all man-made technology
64:13 Stephen Greer's
64:14 project disclosure and yes we're all
64:18 very suspect on Steven Greer if there's
64:22 any example if he is a shill and I hate
64:24 to call him that but if he was if he
64:27 were his formula is to spout a
64:31 tremendous amount of truth and then
64:33 spend at the end right but he did all
64:37 these interviews from military personnel
64:39 and contract personnel that said he saw
64:41 aliens as a as a course of the duty of
64:45 their work and they were all willing to
64:46 testify that that had been the case and
64:49 I think the court case never happened
64:51 but whatever one of the interviews was
64:56 extremely believable I'll try to find
65:00 the episode again and put it in the
65:02 description but it was a soldier who I
65:04 believe was in Chile he's an American
65:07 you stationed down there and they had
65:10 had a report that a vehicle had crashed
65:12 into the mountain and so they're
65:14 expecting to find you know body parts
65:16 everywhere and you know a horrible
65:18 situation when they get down into this
65:21 cavern where it was which he said was
65:23 very difficult to get down there he saw
65:26 a ship embedded in the mountainside and
65:31 it was dripping this kind of purplish
65:33 stuff he said they were very freaked out
65:35 when they realized it wasn't anything
65:36 from this planet that they had ever seen
65:38 before at least but he said that as soon
65:41 as they got close to the ship and this
65:43 guy's like kind of and I want to
65:45 compliment him in this
65:48 he's a very simple guy he wasn't one of
65:51 these sort of Mockingbird dudes or you
65:56 know SIOP kind of guy he was very simple
65:58 in his language style was maybe a little
66:00 ghetto
66:01 he's like a Latino guy or something like
66:04 that and I was so glad that he seemed
66:06 like a normal Joe he's like Lily John
66:08 the plumber right here Joe the plumber
66:10 who used that analogy but he said when
66:13 they got close to the ship he could feel
66:15 them inside and they were making them
66:17 feel soothed and the message he said was
66:20 were okay in here don't worry
66:22 everything's gonna be okay and so they
66:25 kind of he said they kind of roamed
66:27 around and looked at it he said it was
66:28 super smooth and really cool-looking
66:30 he says so like a teardrop jammed into
66:33 the mountainside with the big sight
66:35 first but that's only half the story
66:39 that he told the other half of the story
66:41 he told one of them corroborated
66:43 something that Bob Lazar talked about
66:45 and my friend's personal friends from
66:47 groom Lake out of area 51 that were run
66:51 off the property about five years ago we
66:57 broke the story before the anyone else
66:58 in the world broke the story it was cool
67:00 on him kilcher radio he said that ships
67:06 descended out of the sky that were like
67:09 nothing else he'd ever seen a small
67:13 fleet of them and they landed and to his
67:17 total shock and utter surprise humans
67:21 got out from earth wearing uniforms that
67:27 didn't have any I believe he said no us
67:30 patches on them didn't really have any
67:32 markings on them they had guns like
67:35 normal guns and he said that they
67:38 mmediately started cussing at them you
67:41 know the [ __ ] you think you're doing
67:42 here blah blah blah blah blah and they
67:44 captured him and everybody else but he
67:46 can only talk about his journey he said
67:49 they took him somewhere local there he
67:51 be back in the vehicle or something like
67:53 that and he said that they I believe
67:55 this is the the same story was he was
67:58 getting basically jab by the gun
68:01 and people telling him that he didn't
68:03 see what he saw he's not tell anybody if
68:07 he does he's gonna get killed and also
68:09 there's stuff now the gun jabbing thing
68:12 is something that Bob Lazar said
68:14 happened at the end of every day of work
68:17 and s4 that he had to take a pill that
68:18 made him sort of suggestible and then
68:21 they jabbed him with the gun and said he
68:23 didn't see anything today didn't like
68:24 everything he experienced that day
68:25 didn't happen he said there's a doctor a
68:27 nurse and a soldier and the soldier kept
68:29 hitting him in the chest with the gun it
68:30 was like this routine that was horrid my
68:34 friends who actually owned groom Lake
68:37 and the copper mine that was I guess
68:41 causing the government a problem because
68:43 they couldn't pay them what the land was
68:45 worth let me talk about a bunch of
68:46 [ __ ] right area 51 eminent domain
68:50 the land it did not pay the family
68:53 remotely the price that the land was
68:55 worth when they have more money than
68:58 anyone else on planet Earth
68:59 like why they couldn't just give these
69:01 people the whole price they wanted was
69:02 like 40 million bucks or something for
69:05 all that land had a copper mined on it
69:08 they actually took commandos and bombed
69:11 the copper mine destroying it so it
69:12 couldn't be affordably dug back out
69:15 again and worked they would sneak into
69:17 their house at night and soldiers United
69:20 States soldiers pointed guns of children
69:23 and would jab them with [ __ ] guns and
69:27 try to scare them away so anytime it's
69:30 around alien technology or that kind of
69:32 even though suspicious rumors those guns
69:35 jabbing things seems to be some weird
69:36 technique to create trauma in your body
69:38 right there jabbing you with the gun
69:41 and so that you go to fight or flight
69:43 which means your frontal lobes shut down
69:46 now you're in a complete state of
69:49 suggestibility such that whatever they
69:51 say to you goes to long-term memory and
69:53 then when you think about what happened
69:55 it comes back as truth your frontal
69:58 lobes are really necessary to discern
70:00 information true/false or maybe when
70:03 it's shut down blood wise you're screwed
70:06 okay so a reason why I mentioned that
70:10 one little testimony from that guy and
70:12 I've watched goddamn dozens of
70:14 every single one of them that's up there
70:16 every time a guy would talk about the
70:20 alien stories in any other scenario I
70:23 think maybe there was one other scenario
70:26 so an interview with the guy from
70:27 Harvard they had nothing to do with
70:29 aliens he just happened to be part of
70:31 the disclosure that he talked about the
70:33 fact that he he had three PhDs from
70:37 Harvard excuse me
70:39 not from Harvard MIT excuse me he had
70:41 three PhDs from MIT in relative science
70:44 of zero-point energy systems and he said
70:46 that MIT figured out zero-point energy
70:50 and then blackseed showed up and said
70:51 nope you don't and I remember this in
70:55 the late 80s early 90s the Scientific
70:57 American even just reading about the
70:59 fact that as soon as America debuted
71:03 that they had zero-point energy
71:05 Japan went a few other places when said
71:07 yeah we have a - like everyone's hiding
71:09 this power source but they all have it
71:11 but I remember reading about the
71:13 Japanese one they said blacks you showed
71:15 up out of Europe and told them they
71:17 didn't have it and all the sudden they
71:18 didn't have it's like this in your face
71:21 thing man it's really shitty now - a
71:24 little biscuit out here for our fighters
71:27 folks could be the dome owners aliens
71:31 could be dumb owners these humans that
71:33 came in and yelled at the guy could be
71:34 the dome owners right some straggler you
71:37 know what if the aliens are literally
71:39 like the protesters trying to say we're
71:41 here we're here and there's so much more
71:43 outside this dome you just gotta get the
71:45 [ __ ] out of here and they're getting
71:47 chased by whoo you know our controllers
71:49 be funny little story wouldn't so the
71:52 question is is if that dudes telling the
71:54 truth and all these straight-up
71:57 anti-gravity vehicles that showed up at
71:59 his site to scare the [ __ ] out of them
72:02 and all the people if they have that
72:05 technology then maybe they're way ahead
72:07 of even what I can conceive
72:11 however magnitudes magnitude right big
72:14 is big and you know if you built there's
72:17 a it's really funny there was a god
72:21 probably about
72:22 six or seven years ago and some of you
72:25 know this there are these I think
72:28 special effect shots that are just
72:30 unbelievable of like old space shuttles
72:33 that have all been torn up look like
72:35 they've been attacked by I don't know
72:38 some other spacecraft or something and
72:40 there's like pieces of the Space Shuttle
72:42 floating together and then there's all
72:44 he zoomed up supposedly camera telescope
72:47 shots of these really intense mother
72:50 ships that are up there now the funny
72:52 thing is the phenomenon came and it went
72:54 and it's over if it was true you know
72:58 Dave alone with his hunter deck zoom
73:00 camera could probably grab it but you
73:02 know the phenomenon came and left like
73:04 some studio like Neil Blomkamp's studio
73:09 made these to see if they could get the
73:11 public to buy it just you know these
73:13 could be sign up tests to you believe
73:15 this is real good yeah because we can
73:17 make a lot more of that but I want to
73:20 say that this whole thing about the
73:23 space shuttle Challenger survivors and
73:28 some of you've gone down this path weary
73:31 examined it here at the lounge a couple
73:35 days ago and I have to say min it's like
73:39 you know two guys said that they were
73:41 the twin brothers like landfill out of
73:43 the movie beer fests look exactly like
73:45 they're like mad Agassi twins which are
73:47 the SuperDuper identical twins because
73:50 you know twins look the same we've got a
73:51 few twins in my hometown that are my age
73:53 and they look very similar when they're
73:57 young but as they get older they really
73:59 look different than their brothers or
74:01 sisters and they really do
74:03 I dated a twin it was an identical twin
74:06 of her sister and you know it they told
74:10 she told me Leah I might you know you
74:11 notice that we're twins and I'm like
74:12 really because their bodies went
74:14 different ways one's a hard body works
74:16 out when I'm dating is in a gym you know
74:19 five days a week and runs every morning
74:21 and her sister who's although very
74:24 beautiful and very fit she did a makeup
74:28 completely different or hair completely
74:29 different so with the two guys I think
74:32 it's the Japanese guy in the black guy
74:34 they're using the same
74:36 I think they're they swap mental names
74:39 or something like that a middle name
74:40 swapping Christy mcauliffe Christy was a
74:43 middle name but her first names really
74:45 been Shanta Sharon I think Shannon her
74:48 Sharon so now the new woman is just
74:50 using her real first name so yeah it's
74:54 like and they're involved in aerospace
74:57 yeah one guy died most likely just due
74:59 to old age but they you know I mean I
75:03 don't know it really does look like they
75:05 survived but one of you contacted me and
75:06 said that you had this Wisconsin
75:10 astronaut as a professor and we're gonna
75:12 go ask him and I don't think he ever got
75:14 back to me if you did I apologize
75:16 because I did not see it so I need to
75:19 get back with you or some we need to
75:21 make contact again but for those of you
75:23 didn't hear that stir the whole
75:25 conspiracy and this relates to what
75:28 technology we really have as opposed to
75:31 what they're blowing up our holes right
75:32 this is kind of relevant obviously
75:35 January 28 1986 space shuttle launches
75:38 that morning at 39 degrees Fahrenheit
75:40 which is extremely cold again for those
75:44 celcius folks 32 fahrenheit is zero
75:47 Celsius so just if you'd like a couple
75:50 degrees up in Celsius the coldest the
75:52 Space Shuttle ever launched before was
75:54 69 degrees and a bunch of [ __ ] were
75:56 wrong so they deliberated for 13 hours
75:58 the day before NASA was telling well a
76:01 bunch of scientists and NASA we're
76:03 telling the head management this thing
76:05 might totally go fatal I mean it might
76:07 have just horrible situations here and
76:09 they already prophesized that the
76:11 o-rings might crack upper management of
76:14 NASA told the White House the White
76:17 House said not we want this trip to
76:19 happen and I guess McAuliffe is actually
76:21 the niece of one of the big governors on
76:27 the East Coast but anyway they decided
76:29 to launch it of course we know what
76:31 happened the thing exploded all right
76:34 but the the whole thing about them
76:38 surviving is that you know you might
76:41 have a doppelganger here and there right
76:44 someone who looks just like you
76:46 doppelgangers that actually have
76:48 aerospace
76:50 careers after the shuttle explosion in a
76:53 one's an attorney but one of them
76:56 started aerospace company when he get
76:58 two or three of our aerospace but again
77:00 two of them claim to be the twin
77:02 brothers of the other guys I guess
77:04 there's a bunch of photographic evidence
77:06 but we're talking about the most
77:10 unbelievable identical twins you've ever
77:13 seen in your life man I got two friends
77:17 that are twins and I'm just telling you
77:20 man one of them didn't get as tall as
77:22 the other one one of them they both got
77:24 kind of chubby but they have different
77:26 body dimensions and the way it
77:27 distributed this is it's just
77:29 astronomically [ __ ] against every
77:32 single person is being earmarked as this
77:34 the shuttle survivors have all these
77:38 other telltale signs that they're part
77:40 of that original crew but the thing
77:41 blows up and the theory is that the
77:44 Space Shuttle never had people in it
77:45 ever the new thing you ever saw inside
77:49 of the launch because they have all
77:50 these videos of the astronauts being
77:52 inside when it launches and we've looked
77:54 at those videos and you know if you ever
77:56 watch pilots for the b1 or b2 bombers
78:02 the pilots from the sr-71 they're
78:05 wearing [ __ ] spacesuits man right
78:07 they get pressurized for hours and hours
78:09 before they go up and they know that
78:12 every journey could be the last and not
78:14 because they're at war but just because
78:15 the plane is so fragile at those
78:16 altitudes and those speeds right well I
78:20 know the Space Shuttle is a different
78:21 vehicle but you have certain space
78:24 shuttle launches where people aren't
78:26 wearing anything but they're pedestrian
78:27 clothes inside the vehicle grabbing onto
78:30 the you know the yokes and stuff and
78:32 then you have other space shuttle
78:34 launches where they're just wearing the
78:35 helmet with regular clothes down below
78:38 it's like well pick pick how you're
78:41 supposed to do this guy's what are you
78:43 worried about what are you wearing a
78:44 helmet for if you [ __ ] bang your head
78:47 because this thing's got a navigational
78:50 issue you're probably already gonna be
78:52 pate on the inside of this thing right
78:54 but what if this thing explodes and then
78:58 NASA is like oh [ __ ] they're all on the
79:01 ground they're all safe they're there on
79:04 the set get ready to you know pass it
79:06 you know turning on all the footage of
79:08 what's supposed to be happening on this
79:09 mission and their relatives are all in
79:11 the bleachers watching them die
79:12 you know the McCullough family the
79:15 father and the mother and the bleachers
79:16 they were being specifically filmed
79:19 because you know that was a special
79:21 schoolteacher going up with the whole
79:23 mission right no one was filming the
79:25 other astronauts relatives specifically
79:28 and so you got a big problem on your
79:31 hands right what are you gonna do well
79:33 you know this will eventually secretly
79:35 break it to the family members I don't
79:37 know right now one of the guys he's one
79:40 of the front-and-center pilots he's the
79:43 one that I mean yeah these people look
79:45 exactly the same he launched this
79:48 aerospace company it's like a flying cow
79:51 logo or something like that I guess in
79:53 2013 now it could have been 2013 maybe
79:57 20 yeah a few years ago two three years
80:00 ago he took down his website for his
80:02 company whole company's gone but the
80:03 Wayback Machine org has the websites of
80:06 people were able to actually go in and
80:08 look at what it looked like but he
80:10 literally took it down after this
80:12 conspiracy broke hmm interesting so if
80:17 that's true then we might be more
80:20 [ __ ] in our development and space
80:23 and we think right but now as I got
80:27 another probably 15 minutes here on the
80:29 stick let's talk about sort of a sidecar
80:36 to this whole issue which is one of my
80:40 buddies right that the government has
80:43 either made contacts like Roswell or
80:47 other events and we really don't
80:50 establish that much communication with
80:52 them they just are there I should also
80:55 say - one of the stories I'm gonna throw
80:58 back into this my best friends in the
81:01 whole world a big special effects guy on
81:04 Tron his father was a test pilot and he
81:08 said to his son on him literally on his
81:10 deathbed
81:12 because he said his father's very one of
81:13 these sort of still week forties fifties
81:15 kind of guys where if you don't know
81:17 what those folks were there were no
81:20 emotions that you were supposed to show
81:21 as a man and you certainly didn't say
81:23 anything
81:24 conspiratorial or you know if a guy in
81:28 that day and age saw an alien they would
81:31 tell anybody because they're not
81:33 supposed to come off as you know
81:36 potentially being a loopy person right
81:39 anyway on his deathbed he said look
81:43 because I believe the way the scenario
81:45 went is he and his sister were in the
81:47 room and he asked his daughter to leave
81:49 the room so he could talk to his son who
81:52 again is his special-effects [ __ ] god
81:54 I mean he was literally at the precipice
81:56 of CG men so in terms of telling him
82:00 something of this nature picked the
82:03 right guy so he told his son he goes
82:06 look one of my trips test flying the
82:10 highest altitude plane and we don't know
82:12 exactly how high it was he said this
82:15 would have been in the 40s okay he said
82:18 I had a about a 30-foot vehicle because
82:22 he these I guess pilots know how to
82:24 measure things in space because they
82:26 know how long their wings are and so
82:28 they'll do this little bit of geometry
82:29 and that allows them to report Intel
82:32 down properly so they're trained to do
82:33 what I'm about to tell you
82:35 they said this disk flew up to his
82:38 vehicle and was so close to him that in
82:43 his training at this high altitude he
82:46 can't just turn because he's going
82:48 really really fast in one direction
82:50 which I guess you know it would have
82:53 been the first Jets who knows what this
82:54 thing might have been but he said this
82:56 thing had pulsing lights around the
82:59 outer rim and he said it just toyed with
83:01 him for quite a while up there in the
83:03 sky and he thought he was gonna die
83:04 because he thought it looked like it was
83:05 gonna bump his plane like it didn't
83:07 understand what he feared was that it
83:10 didn't understand what he needs to do to
83:11 keep this thing in the sky if it's
83:13 organic or something you know some big
83:15 jellyfish from space or something you
83:17 might be like hey buddy what's up you
83:19 know and mess with it didn't he
83:21 obviously survives he did actually
83:26 and that took him out with some
83:29 disabilities and became a commercial
83:30 pilot
83:31 I guess his father would actually fly
83:34 people like Bob Hope over to the USO you
83:38 know entertaining troops here and there
83:40 he see his father said that Bob Hope was
83:42 a real arrogant jerk but who knows maybe
83:45 he just had a few drinks anyway so
83:47 that's not a substantiative thing but
83:52 the sidecar is you know you are working
83:55 for an intelligence agency you're
83:57 working for the military and all you
84:01 need in my opinion is one catalyzing
84:04 event that freaks you out right they do
84:09 down a plane they do attack a person
84:12 they do destroy some facility or
84:14 something like that whatever
84:15 now I'm not aware of any of that ever
84:17 occurring but I also would assume that
84:21 if you're gonna hide one piece of
84:23 information it would be the
84:24 vulnerability of your country such that
84:27 you don't make anyone think that you
84:29 can't handle what's going on according
84:31 to Whitley Strieber in his second book
84:33 transformation he talked about I think
84:38 he even talked about it in oh sorry it
84:39 was actually a majestic excuse me
84:41 majestic the book he wrote where he
84:43 talks about Roswell and stuff but he
84:45 went way past Roswell in the book and he
84:47 said that they had evidence during I
84:50 guess Truman's era that aliens were
84:56 snatching human beings either
84:59 permanently or permanently in the in the
85:03 respective fetuses or temporarily and
85:06 KITT in terms of the parents so I took
85:08 the parents up woman and take their
85:11 babies now what that kind of sounds like
85:15 to me personally is governments maybe
85:21 Luciferian folks or satanic people
85:24 taking kids to do other things
85:27 bio research or whatever and then they
85:29 just blame it on aliens and history were
85:32 legitimizes it through his nonfiction
85:34 fiction
85:36 but we have to assume that there if
85:39 there were intelligent beings visiting
85:43 us that they wouldn't all be from the
85:44 same place the same race and therefore
85:47 would not have the same objectives can
85:50 you imagine we discover a primitive race
85:55 on Mars let's just say as an example
85:58 alright well the Russians go and the
86:02 Americans go and the European Union goes
86:05 maybe I think we're kind of done with
86:09 people that can do it
86:10 maybe if China can steal the technology
86:12 they go okay you think they're gonna
86:15 have even remotely the same conversation
86:18 with intent being the same with the
86:22 plans of how to get along being even
86:24 remotely the same Russia is gonna want a
86:26 completely different thing that we're
86:27 gonna want I would say the two that
86:29 would probably get it the most alike
86:30 would be Russia and the u.s. at least in
86:33 this 2020 era European Union they're
86:37 gonna try to [ __ ] in agenda21
86:39 Mars I mean they're gonna try it enslave
86:42 those people you know I mean they're
86:43 gonna do if they were primitive they
86:45 would definitely try to control them
86:46 100% because that's what they do right
86:48 it's all about the old the old monarchy
86:52 ways is what the EU is all about right
86:54 in America it's like so the cognitive
86:57 dissonance dissonance in America is
86:59 unbelievable we have a communist
87:03 guy running for president for the
87:06 Democratic Party and we're also supposed
87:09 to hate Russia because Russia is all bad
87:11 but he's wants to bring Russia right to
87:14 America it's like unbelievable so anyway
87:20 let me know what you think
87:21 I think we've touched on a bunch of new
87:23 stuff in this particular area of the
87:24 conversation you know some of my
87:27 questions for for average people meaning
87:29 not scientists but maybe you are
87:33 scientists the basic questions I want to
87:36 ask you is if an alien offer to take you
87:40 away like Richard Dreyfuss at the end of
87:42 Close Encounters would you go
87:45 let's see answer the question from the
87:50 age where you had no family
87:51 meaning wife husband or kids and then
87:55 answer the question as if you you know
87:59 maybe you already have these things you
88:00 maybe even have grandkids would you go
88:03 let's say that in one scenario you can
88:07 write a letter and leave it behind in
88:09 another scenario there's no time it's
88:11 either now or not they seem friendly
88:13 they seem totally friendly would you go
88:16 just for the experience they assure you
88:18 that you're you're oxygenated air that
88:21 you breathe there's going to be provided
88:22 that whatever you eat is going to be
88:24 provided you know be alright and the
88:26 second question which might require a
88:28 slightly meteor answer and you can do
88:31 this on Facebook and our Locke's
88:32 Facebook group where you can do this in
88:33 YouTube would be if you did have an
88:37 alien in your living room clearly not
88:41 human what would you most want to ask
88:46 them and maybe it's more than one
88:49 question maybe do your top five
88:51 questions that you might ask them you
88:53 might find that three is enough to
88:55 really get the big ones out the door the
88:59 other question I have for you is do you
89:00 think that they the government deep
89:05 state could actually pull off a fake at
89:07 this point
89:09 100% even you being like damn that's
89:13 crazy
89:13 do you think they can build a big giant
89:15 ship like Independence Day or district 9
89:19 do you think they can do that and then
89:21 what would you have to see and an alien
89:25 being to believe that they are legit not
89:28 from Earth
89:29 not some hybrid thing that the
89:32 intelligence agency created again there
89:35 was a guy and give a pretty decent
89:36 interview at a picnic table in England
89:40 where he said he was exposed to a what
89:44 he believed a home homegrown hybrid
89:47 reptile human being he said a freaked
89:51 amount it was gigantic
89:52 it looked formidable me very tough and
89:55 but it was also very monotone it was
89:57 being escorted by two guys down a
89:58 hallway and he just happened to
90:00 accidents office at the right time
90:02 got a glance at it utterly shattered his
90:05 soul and he kept going he was the
90:09 interview was actually pretty awesome
90:10 very short so anyway load me up let me

90:45 subject that you can think of and see if
90:49 there's an episode on it because if
90:50 there's not you need to let me know I am
90:52 needing suggestions from you folks my
90:56 only caveat with suggestions is if it
91:00 requires a tremendous amount of research
91:01 I tend not to have the time to do it
91:04 I've got tons of stuff in my list that
91:06 requires me to sit down for two days and
91:08 just do nothing but you know watch
91:10 videos and read as much as I possibly
91:11 can about subjects I just don't have the
91:13 time at this point in my life
91:15 but we have social media which is

91:55 this channel so you need to go off to
91:56 the other channel to see they all do
91:57 remastered season one it's about 80

92:22 of a relic it's two UFO designs one of
92:25 them has branding on the back with lots
92:27 of options the other ones just the
92:28 t-shirts that'll have a very kind of
92:30 exclusive thing to it again as the
92:32 seasons over those shirts are gone
