00:00 [Music]
00:34 welcome back the deep thoughts ladies
00:36 and gentlemen today I thought I'd throw
00:39 it like I'm a wild card out there I
00:41 think this episode is gonna demand that
00:44 you get ready to create a vision in your
00:47 brain and hold it in your brain for the
00:51 entire episode and then we're going to
00:54 orbit this image and talk about it it's
01:00 going to be a micro repeat of various
01:03 concepts and other videos but I think
01:06 that one it's good we revisit this
01:10 concept and two I think it's good that
01:13 we look at it and create new connections
01:16 between the pieces it's sort of like if
01:20 you if you have a look at two
01:23 televisions side-by-side and you think
01:26 oh that's one television then you zoom
01:28 in you realize there's a seam in the
01:30 middle and then you're like oh there's
01:32 two televisions well then let's look at
01:34 one of them really close and you realize
01:36 there's LEDs and then you zoom into that
01:39 and then there's multiple IDs oh now
01:42 there's RGB red green and blue you keep
01:45 going down and down right and you keep
01:46 seeing more because you keep zooming in
01:51 eventually you might come to some atomic
01:54 thing that you don't understand but you
01:57 just see energy whizzing around you're
01:58 like god that's it you when you go deep
02:01 enough this is what you see this episode
02:05 is gonna be about us what we are because
02:11 I think we have it wrong
02:12 and I think we've had it wrong forever
02:15 what we are now when I say wrong I am
02:20 going to be talking about our physical
02:23 body we can only speculate how our
02:29 consciousness interacts with this body
02:34 how perhaps that consciousness could be
02:37 referred to as our soul again the
02:39 problem with saying some of these words
02:41 is that they are they're heavily usurped
02:45 by religion and so if I say soul oh my
02:50 gosh
02:50 if I said God people have a problem I'm
02:53 talking about the universe when I say
02:55 God everything you know AB me and the
03:01 universe and everything is God that's
03:04 how I think about it but God has one
03:07 syllable so I say that instead so what's
03:11 the vision and I you know I haven't seen
03:15 every piece of artwork people have done
03:17 I haven't seen everything that art
03:20 students and special effects students
03:22 have done so maybe someone has created
03:23 this image it's just out there on a
03:26 YouTube video and if it isn't great send
03:29 it to me and I'll meditate on it I truly
03:32 think I was given in an epiphany from
03:36 the universe one of those agnostic
03:38 Easter eggs when I saw Eric Dollar
03:41 defined gravity as the negative space
03:44 between ether winds you're talking about
03:50 twenty years of my life probably almost
03:53 thirty years of my life
03:54 clicking instantaneously at least twenty
03:57 five everything made sense or a shit-ton
04:03 more made sense than ever made sense
04:05 before you know and I mean you have to
04:08 understand from the age of eighteen to
04:10 twenty eight I was furiously trying to
04:15 develop a unified theory of the universe
04:17 but the problem was is that all the
04:20 [ __ ] physics that's out there all
04:21 the theoretical models that are out
04:23 there
04:24 did nothing but make sure that my brain
04:26 could never figure it out once I heard
04:30 Eric Dollard read back these old texts
04:35 by the Masters and he showed a graph of
04:38 two objects blocking ether winds you
04:41 know between each other and that
04:43 compensating for a negative force a
04:46 negative pressure which creates orbital
04:49 gravity as it is above so - is it below
04:53 clicked there aren't different physics
04:57 at a macro level then there are at a
04:59 micro level and that's the beauty of the
05:02 whole thing man bart sibrel like i said
05:07 in a previous post interview statement
05:11 he said well you know gravity is there
05:13 because bubbles are in water and I'm
05:15 sitting there looking at this going
05:17 sure [ __ ] is and how does the bubble get
05:20 created what is a bubble it's not matter
05:24 pulling against matter is it it's a
05:30 clump of air
05:31 stuck in a thicker substance called
05:34 water and the water pushes on the air
05:38 creating a bubble oh my god but I you
05:42 know it's a pull in outer space right
05:47 everything's right in front of your face
05:48 everything's super duper goddamn simples
05:51 right in front of your face and we're
05:52 just not seeing it so lame when I
05:58 started this series I didn't I don't
05:59 think I knew this and so I've got shows
06:02 out there if you cut together what I've
06:04 said it's gonna be some potentially
06:07 contradicting statements that's it's
06:09 very fascinating that that's the case
06:11 the Epiphany I got was looking at
06:14 current in water and realizing that that
06:17 spin and this is nothing tremendously
06:19 new mean the Hadron Collider has been
06:20 doing this the colliders in general been
06:22 doing this forever we classify energy in
06:26 a particular state as a particular
06:32 objects but in in you know in space-time
06:35 you would say a neutron electron a
06:37 proton
06:37 okay that's not new but looking at it as
06:42 in a water metaphor is fascinating now
06:45 what you have to be able to do is extend
06:47 your mind so when I say a current and
06:49 water there's all kinds of currents
06:52 there that word is used a little too
06:55 much but what I'm talking about is the
06:59 currents that yank you down underneath
07:00 the water usually happens at a bridge
07:03 right where the support beams come down
07:05 and block the flow of water what's
07:10 happening in a linear way there you know
07:12 when the water hits the pylon little
07:16 tiny orbital tornados are happening in
07:19 the water you could just see them they
07:20 have dark impressions because they have
07:23 that little you know funnel that goes
07:25 down now what you have to do in your
07:28 brain is to lift that two-dimensional
07:31 thing out into a 3-dimensional sphere
07:34 and understand that this is happening in
07:37 all dimensions up-down left-right cross
07:40 you could just take a ninja sword and
07:41 cut it tomato in any direction as long
07:43 as you go through Center and that's the
07:48 vector of push that is also pushing now
07:52 you have to trust me here all matter in
07:57 the universe is made of one thing II
08:01 throw winds
08:02 II throw particles II throw particles
08:05 have no charge they're not positive they
08:08 are not negative they are simply
08:09 particles and they simply move extremely
08:13 fast again
08:15 Faraday and Tesla said they moved it 50
08:17 times the speed of light all right we
08:20 don't really need to know how fast they
08:21 move at this stage in the conversation
08:23 well we needed what we need to know is
08:26 that when water bangs into the pylon
08:29 underneath the bridge it creates these
08:31 tornado currents well what is a pylon in
08:35 the universe if it's full of ether winds
08:39 its other pylons it's other ether winds
08:43 anything can get together and create a
08:45 little bit of a you know a little bit of
08:47 a party starts creating
08:51 magnetic orbital currents in three
08:56 dimensions your electron current once
08:59 that starts happening boy starts
09:00 tricking all the other ones to follow
09:02 suit the dielectric energy which is the
09:05 ricocheting vectors of particles hitting
09:09 each other and just bouncing straight
09:10 off you know they start getting tangled
09:12 in there as well and this is where we
09:16 start building the atomic designations
09:18 that we call atoms and all the different
09:20 pieces and parts quarks it's just the
09:22 same theory going further down and
09:24 further down into the bay and into the
09:26 maze but it's all a fractal all right
09:30 what makes an electron exists is the
09:32 same principle and the same stuff that
09:35 makes every other discernable particle
09:40 that man has ever fabled to have
09:43 discovered the same thing it's all the
09:46 same it's all the same why is light
09:50 different lights different because it is
09:54 truly a verbal reaction when all these
09:58 orbital patterns get disturbed by a
10:02 cause there's an effect and the effect
10:05 is a gigantic release I think of
10:10 transverse energy now there are some
10:12 theories that light is also longitudinal
10:15 which means instantaneous transfer I'm
10:19 not sure pretty damn sure when we slow
10:25 down light going through the coke-bottle
10:26 that's a transverse wave it's not
10:30 instantaneous you can watch it crawl
10:33 okay so what are we what are we if these
10:40 are the building blocks of the entire
10:41 universe right now cosmologists and I
10:46 don't even know what you call these
10:48 other folks the people that are studying
10:49 classic electricity using ether Oh
10:52 models because we call ether Oh
10:55 scientists they are fighting a holy war
10:59 to bring back the notion
11:03 of ether winds that's what I'm doing
11:04 right and my little getaway so the
11:08 problem is is if you think about any
11:10 theory that's ever discovered you need a
11:13 time to form the theory to get everyone
11:16 to buy into it and then you apply your
11:18 wisest minds to it and then you find out
11:21 what you can do with it we didn't used
11:25 to eat peanuts out of the ground
11:28 most countries had banned tomatoes
11:30 because they said they were poison for
11:32 the human body for what I understand the
11:34 skin is not good for you he goes on and
11:37 on well do you think caveman knew the
11:41 oil was combustible to any effect of
11:44 creating I don't know refined gasoline
11:46 and then a combustion engine so on a
11:49 sore foot so forth high octane this high
11:51 octane that probably not it took a long
11:54 goddamn time to acknowledge that these
11:57 things were flammable and that when you
11:59 create an explosion it creates force and
12:01 then let's make a combustion piston but
12:03 Papa we need an o-ring and a air valve
12:05 and a little spritz or spark plug to pop
12:08 it so what can we start doing if we just
12:13 take the youth role theory and just say
12:15 yes that is true
12:16 boom now what are we to draw a model of
12:22 the human body in some sort of
12:24 three-dimensional form we would need to
12:26 take every single piece of atomic
12:29 designation that we have temporary
12:32 control of right everything in the human
12:36 body renews every seven years so you
12:37 only have temporary possession of the
12:40 atomic matter that makes up your body
12:42 and that's before you get into E throw
12:44 winds I can only keep a cell seven years
12:48 and not really you can only keep what
12:51 the cell creates with seven years cuz
12:53 cells usually live about you know I
12:55 think someone said it was you know just
13:01 a few months it was like three to four
13:02 months they get replaced but now let's
13:08 go deeper because the metaphor continues
13:11 it's a scientific reality
13:14 we are nothing but a ton of currents in
13:18 water everything that we have temporary
13:21 control of well it's not really there
13:24 for any length of time what do I mean
13:29 let's go back to the gravity episode
13:31 you've got a current that's just
13:33 persistent in the river
13:35 you're just looking right out at that
13:36 tornado thing right you can even do this
13:38 in the drain of your sink and the drain
13:40 in the tub you pour some food coloring
13:43 in you watch it go down the drain now
13:47 the current stays there it stays it
13:49 maintains its form but for a second is
13:51 purple or whatever and it goes then it
13:54 goes down the drain and it's gone but
13:56 the currents still there hmm okay ever
14:02 wonder why your double helix your
14:05 nucleic acid chains you ever wonder why
14:07 they are in some sort of spiral why
14:12 there's so many spirals all over the
14:14 place the golden mean the Fibonacci
14:16 pattern it's because the overall growth
14:21 pattern is influenced by the spins that
14:25 happen on all levels right you can look
14:30 at a big giant cactus that's like damn
14:32 near two foot in diameter you're the
14:34 ones with the little tiny teeth it's
14:36 been out from the center it's an amazing
14:39 gigantic Fibonacci pattern look at a
14:41 seashell look at a rose the way that the
14:44 rose petals come off look at the way the
14:46 thorns go up the stem and spiral towards
14:49 you men is probably one of the most
14:53 asymmetrical things out there we're
14:57 pretty good on the outside but our
14:58 insides are all asymmetrical stomach on
15:01 the left liver on the right the
15:03 intestines are kind of either go down
15:04 really intense on the right side and
15:06 they come way up on the left side not
15:09 very symmetrical but now just imagine
15:12 one of those images of like protoman
15:15 like take Prometheus the guy at the very
15:17 beginning of the film he's got no hair
15:18 for some reason and you just strip them
15:23 down and just make his every pixel
15:28 vibrate and oscillate in orbit and then
15:33 figure out that all the ether winds that
15:36 exist in the universe have to go through
15:39 this guy and all of his designations
15:41 everything that he has temporary control
15:43 of gets a spin and then he gets to exist
15:50 his ladyfriend same thing and you know
15:55 it's probably spiraling in a million
15:58 different directions right as I move my
15:59 hands and my fingers right there's most
16:01 likely some vector in which you know my
16:05 finger ejects the energy it's coming
16:08 through it we talk about massage on this
16:11 show and how it's important that people
16:12 touch you right maybe that's a reason
16:15 why the laying of hands man that [ __ ] as
16:19 real as it could possibly be
16:22 you can pull stress right out of a human
16:24 being with very little muscle tissue
16:27 movement or anything but now that's the
16:31 physical form that we really focus on
16:32 and it's probably good that we have a
16:34 fairly concrete idea of how we our
16:38 bodies
16:41 hang on to themselves right now what's
16:46 interesting is is when you study
16:48 electricity and how electrons move you
16:52 will get this definition of how an
16:56 electron actually jumps on a conductive
17:00 surface from atom a to atom B or atom 1
17:05 to 2 to 3 and it's hype it's it's hop
17:08 skipping and jumping but then another
17:10 one has to fill its place and it's this
17:14 skipping this trading of electrons that
17:18 gives us the stimulating surface on a
17:21 valence that gives us a conductive wave
17:23 that will shock the [ __ ] out of you if
17:25 you grab the power outlet in your wet
17:27 okay we got to keep going coming back to
17:31 the phrase as it is above so - it is
17:35 below and we gotta reverse it every once
17:37 in a while as it is below so - it is
17:39 above
17:41 what could electrons teach us about
17:43 ourselves because you might ask yourself
17:46 well then okay if all these currents are
17:48 happening but how does stuff stick
17:50 together
17:51 what's a nuclear bond I mean why does
17:55 splitting an atom seem to make a big
17:56 popping noise right of nothing else we
18:00 have to solve for how we're all glued
18:02 together all right how does the sweater
18:06 stay together how does a fabric become a
18:10 fabric
18:11 how does a rope become a rope I mean
18:14 wasn't it all just kind of to be better
18:17 cotton balls it could be in a silk weave
18:19 I mean yeah that stuff kind of sticks to
18:22 itself but come on how'd you make a huge
18:24 bedspread out of it we wove it in a loom
18:29 but you might be saying well you're
18:31 cheating you're taking really stationary
18:36 looking stuff and you're weaving it
18:38 inside and out and hey that's man
18:40 weaving and there's many weaves in the
18:42 world you're telling me that the
18:43 universe has a weave ha ha I could be a
18:47 pretty funny joke hmm we're talking
18:52 about string theory I don't think so but
18:56 there's probably some similar principles
18:58 and thoughts in that room but if a
19:03 conductive material shows us a very
19:06 blatant exchange of nuclear matter that
19:09 is going in a magnetic orbit you know
19:14 the only reason why it becomes electric
19:16 and becomes electromagnetic is because
19:18 it bounces into the dialectic force or
19:20 the dielectric ether that bounces off
19:23 the center right we don't need to worry
19:27 about those details we do not but if a
19:32 bunch of currents get together in the
19:34 water and I've seen this they dance
19:37 around how many of you have played
19:40 around with a drain when you were a
19:41 little kid in the bathtub or you filled
19:44 the whole sink up and you get these
19:46 little micro tornadoes you know you'd
19:48 pull your finger through the through the
19:50 big one you pull it back towards the
19:52 water that's draining
19:53 and you kill these little micro ones
19:55 they only last for a little while
19:56 sometimes but sometimes one you know
19:58 there's two of them that circle each
19:59 other you get a binary tornado system
20:02 hmm once you have one disturbance in
20:07 this fabric mmm you're cooking with gas
20:10 it's sort of like when you start a motor
20:13 in a car before it had starters you go
20:17 around the front you crank this crank
20:19 wham wham wham Wham with all sudden boom
20:21 you get combusted in the engine and
20:22 you're good until you turn it off begin
20:26 if there's something wrong with our cars
20:28 we always find out when we turn them off
20:29 right he won't start okay but the
20:33 universe can't turn off there's nothing
20:36 out there to turn it off doesn't have an
20:37 off switch luckily for us there is an
20:43 object that behaves like an atom and it
20:49 has a nucleus which I think the
20:53 gentleman who built Coral Castle was
20:56 probably correct in saying that it had a
20:59 photon in the center something probably
21:04 very strong thus probably very violent
21:08 in its center and because it is so
21:11 intense it keeps its neighboring ether
21:16 winds very loyal to it which is where we
21:22 start getting what we perceive as
21:23 stationary matter which we write in
21:25 equations as M now we know that there
21:29 are laws of physics you could say I even
21:31 hate saying the word physics today
21:33 because it's so at the root of what is
21:36 wrong with this world but we know there
21:39 are true principles of physics we just
21:41 do or at least we we can use them as
21:44 mechanisms to predict whatever is
21:46 actually taking place right like we can
21:48 calculate generally the force of gravity
21:52 it's not technically correct but it's
21:55 correct enough right we know what
21:57 terminal velocity is we know how to
21:59 build rockets based on gravity and plane
22:01 wings and jet engines so we've got it
22:04 99.9% dialed in
22:06 good enough men so these objects hold
22:10 themselves together through their
22:11 orbital rules and when you look at
22:15 everything up close let's see we're able
22:17 to zoom yourself into one of these cores
22:21 of an atom and you got these special
22:22 sunglasses on so you look cool and you
22:25 don't lose your eyesight it's some crazy
22:28 furnace of moving ether wings
22:32 potentially as Faraday and Tesla said
22:35 moving it 50 times the speed of light
22:38 now some of you are old school you're
22:40 gonna be like that's impossible because
22:42 e equals mc-squared said you just loose
22:44 that [ __ ] out of your brain okay that
22:46 was planted in your mind to screw you
22:49 over for the rest of your life so you
22:51 simply had a barrier in your brain a
22:52 religious barrier that said light has
22:55 this limitation in the medium that we
22:59 view light it generally has a particular
23:02 speed but that speed is varied all
23:05 around the world due to environmental
23:07 conditions probably the density of the
23:11 earth wherever you're measuring it you
23:14 could probably measure I don't know you
23:17 might if you climb to the center of the
23:20 Everest you might have light travel a
23:22 different speed than if you were say
23:25 flying if 80,000 feet with nothing below
23:29 you not a mountain or anything right so
23:31 different gravity bubbles and negative
23:34 forces might affect the ability of the
23:36 transverse wave to travel probably
23:38 medium it's going through air or water
23:39 or whatever right anyway the next thing
23:43 you have to do with your brain is
23:46 understand that once you have a Lego
23:49 block you can start building other
23:54 higher constructs other things now those
23:58 of you who have seen Legos in your
23:59 lifetime you know that there's actually
24:01 a Lego that is one Lego big it's one
24:05 unit high it only has one little nipple
24:08 on it and if I gave you a million of
24:11 those and said build me a boat here's a
24:14 million build me a boat well you'd be
24:18 hard-pressed because it really grows on
24:20 in one-dimension up and down
24:23 you can't go left you can't go right
24:25 you're gonna go up and down so the most
24:28 that you could possibly do is to create
24:32 ropes out of this stuff and somehow pray
24:35 to God they stay together and try to tie
24:38 them all together
24:38 you'd have to probably use glue burn
24:41 them and melt them together and you can
24:42 maybe create some rope out of those
24:44 one-dimensional Legos all right but what
24:50 if I gave you a two-dimensional piece it
24:54 has two little nipples on top it's one
24:56 unit hi I just gave you magic now you
25:01 can create the boat isn't that amazing
25:04 because you can go left and right and
25:06 you can create a labyrinth you could
25:08 create solid matter with those things
25:11 you'd have to cut a loop it around
25:13 itself because it can't quite you know
25:15 do what a brick does but it's pretty
25:17 damn close and if you study up if you
25:22 study Stephen Wolfram and his gigantic
25:27 book called a new kind of science he
25:31 will teach you that the unit of three
25:33 and four is paramount to the universe
25:38 now take our Lego if I made you a Lego
25:42 with three units and another Lego with
25:44 four units
25:47 now the infinite complexity of which you
25:50 could create is pretty much at your
25:52 disposal it's infinite right all right
25:58 so a very little entangling of the
26:03 see-through wind you can start building
26:06 the entire universe and you can be
26:10 devoid of any patterns with just a
26:13 distinction of three or four individual
26:17 sizes of units best way to think about
26:20 it is a four you've got a 1 a 2 a 3 and
26:23 a 4 with those Legos you could build
26:25 anything you really could at some level
26:30 that will be pixelated right how many
26:33 times have you seen
26:34 and build you know like Han Solo out of
26:36 Legos yeah from 50 feet away it's like
26:39 Jesus looks like Harrison Ford do you
26:41 close to your like what is this Oh back
26:44 up 10 feet 20 feet 30 feet oh it's
26:45 Harrison Ford got it good okay I think
26:49 most of you know if you take your high
26:50 school portrait with an electron
26:52 microscope no one would know who you are
26:54 and that's the way we have to think
26:56 about things but we are this humming
27:02 phosphorus thing every single moment
27:07 that you exist and let's just go with
27:09 that 50 times the speed of light that
27:11 means that within one second of time the
27:18 amount of ether wins the potentially
27:22 pass through you to be you to keep you
27:27 you is damn near infinite I mean in
27:30 terms of you trying to count how much
27:33 passes through you in one second which
27:35 is an eternity when it comes down to
27:36 this sort of you know nanosecond kind of
27:41 stuff right it's phenomenal well sort of
27:44 unit of math what we have to develop to
27:47 really think about well to take the pain
27:50 out of our brains of thinking about
27:51 things moving 50 times the speed of
27:53 light and that's pretty damn fast right
27:57 so then light itself seems pretty damn
27:59 slow one fiftieth of the speed of the
28:02 matter that creates the coke-bottle as
28:06 what you can see going through the coke
28:08 bottle because someone stimulated the
28:11 verb the ripple in the water that is
28:13 light can't have a ripple without water
28:18 can't have light without ether you just
28:22 can't but now let's go to the human body
28:27 you know technically the most primitive
28:31 version of the human body is the current
28:32 in the river a key I'm just gonna keep
28:35 repeating these metaphors in your brain
28:37 so you don't lose them except your times
28:41 I don't know a trillion you have a
28:44 trillion of those little things in you
28:47 easily probably I don't know hundred
28:50 trillion quadrillion who knows doesn't
28:53 matter if we have the universe itself
28:57 coming through us renewing us like I've
29:01 indicated in other episodes and it just
29:03 will not leave me alone inside the
29:06 packets of energy that are ether
29:09 particles right again they don't really
29:11 have any positive negative charge but
29:13 inside them their configurations must
29:18 account for or at least provide a medium
29:20 for information so what's that mean
29:26 well a lot of us are hive minding right
29:32 now like crazy we're open to new ideas
29:35 and therefore we are receiving its again
29:38 it's really a matter of its it's sort of
29:41 unlike tuning to a radio station with
29:44 your radio maybe that's the way it works
29:47 but I would like to suggest a different
29:49 metaphor which is that you've been
29:52 hearing white noise your whole life you
29:54 don't really hear it thank God because
29:56 otherwise you'd go nuts although I have
29:59 some marker friends with massive
30:01 tinnitus who would argue with me but I
30:03 have a thought let's just say wherever I
30:06 am in the world and whenever I am in the
30:08 world and if you're happen to be in
30:10 existence downwind from me which could
30:17 be omnidirectional right you know when
30:20 you make a big noise isn't an amazing
30:22 how the big noise goes away from Center
30:24 like a ripple and water it's not going
30:27 in one direction maybe that's the way it
30:29 goes I don't know the more we want peace
30:32 the more we can make it happen the more
30:35 that the press especially the fake media
30:38 I mean to make this political but if you
30:40 have propaganda coming in you 24/7
30:42 you're manifesting reality and it's not
30:45 a joke it's not even a metaphor you
30:48 really are making reality happen because
30:50 you're injecting lies into people's
30:52 brains that they amplify all around the
30:56 world should get a little scary if you
30:59 really contemplate what I'm telling you
31:01 but the good news is the inverse is also
31:04 amazing and thankfully whoever created
31:08 us imbued us with certain dispositions
31:13 that you might call common-law we don't
31:18 want anyone to harm us and therefore we
31:20 inherently understand why we don't want
31:26 to hurt anyone else our selves raise
31:29 your hand if you've read the study that
31:31 says the people can sense when they're
31:34 being looked at I did in I think the
31:37 evolution episode I think I have been
31:43 researching this for years and the more
31:45 I got into electronics and where got
31:46 into light the more I believe this huge
31:49 way which is because our brains are sort
31:53 of a fibonacci shell right out from the
31:55 pineal gland and because our eye sockets
31:58 are these caverns inside of our skulls
32:01 our nasal canal maintains all of our
32:04 ability to articulate how many times
32:09 have you had someone do one of these
32:11 things that I have god I have a
32:14 girlfriend that does this to me all the
32:15 time she'll want me to listen to her the
32:20 common complaint between Mars and Venus
32:22 and she says she starts to sentence off
32:26 looking straight at me we'll be in a
32:28 loud place right and then she'll answer
32:32 it by turning around looking the other
32:33 way and Allison I can't hear her because
32:36 it sounds over here that's over there
32:37 right I'm always going what like an old
32:40 man I'm like so then she'll do it again
32:43 she'll look at me and finish two-thirds
32:45 of the sentence looking away from me in
32:47 a really loud restaurant or allowed
32:49 public place since I have to grab her
32:51 shoulders and go don't look away from me
32:53 tell me to my face it's very loud in
32:55 here right and some people will actually
32:58 take their volume down as they talk if
33:01 they get nervous I was getting a coffee
33:04 the other day and this kid was trying to
33:07 ask me I forgot the hell he was trying
33:09 to ask me but he asked me you just
33:13 like that look what well do you whatever
33:17 I'm like I'm sorry can you answer where
33:20 someone's using the [ __ ] blender off
33:22 to the right and so I think that's just
33:25 a couple funny digressions on this
33:27 theory but the idea is this the human
33:30 body is designed to pitch every piece of
33:35 frequency out the front of our skull it
33:39 really is how we were designed when you
33:41 take the upper construct of sound and
33:43 perhaps overt thought and the reason why
33:49 I think people can feel you looking at
33:51 them is because your skull from your
33:55 nose it's just like you know so it's
33:57 like the toucan right
33:58 follow your nose man looking at someone
34:00 and you are pushing a lot more thought
34:02 you're probably pushing out the back
34:04 your head too but you're pushing a lot
34:05 more focus on that person and you know
34:09 if you stare at someone your people
34:10 watching you are putting a lot of
34:16 analysis into people not just staring in
34:19 their direction you know I could go to
34:20 the beach and stare at the water and I'm
34:22 actually staring at a hundred people I'm
34:25 not sure all those people are gonna turn
34:26 around go
34:27 someone's looking at me no no no if
34:30 you're some creeper at some park and
34:32 you're looking at some housewife yeah
34:34 she's gonna go I'm by myself I was
34:36 feeling really comfortable reading my
34:38 book while my kids playing over there on
34:40 the swing set but now I feel awkward hmm
34:45 everyone's worried about death a lot of
34:48 people are write books about it friends
34:51 of friends of mine who claim they're so
34:53 tough buy me these books about the fear
34:55 of death and then tell me how brilliant
34:58 the book is and how accurate it is and
35:01 so I read the book and I'm waitin wait a
35:03 minute this book says that whoever
35:05 believes this believes that were utterly
35:07 terrified of death and then if we don't
35:11 have the fear of death and we have a
35:13 psychosis we're broken right so stupid
35:17 but anyway it's godless people who fear
35:20 death
35:21 it really is again I mean the universe
35:27 but now how would we introduced into our
35:31 vibrating current body okay
35:34 made of all these rules that govern
35:36 everything that you see all day long how
35:40 does our soul get in there or are the
35:43 thoughts that we have just chemicals in
35:45 a bag and our brain does ether explain
35:48 the brain because we appear to have an
35:52 identity we appear to have memories and
35:54 a lot of you know infinite storage and
35:57 our disposal is it merely because the
36:00 harddrive is so teeny-tiny on a
36:02 microscopic level on a sub quantum level
36:07 that it's just all in there but we can't
36:09 track it hmm I'm gonna say it doesn't
36:15 appear so it's funny because if he read
36:17 Kreutz Wells books where he believes he
36:19 has cracked the code of the human mind
36:21 and the chemical chains the [ __ ]
36:24 books are full of constant speculation
36:26 it's just as bad as reading a David Icke
36:28 book with you know 80% channeling other
36:33 people's you know whatever lumeria or
36:37 atlantis or something so that you can
36:39 lock down something about the raw childs
36:41 I mean it's just like hokey [ __ ] right
36:43 hats off if you can find any truth in
36:46 that stuff but I can't personally right
36:48 I'm not going for a cold [ __ ] reading
36:51 right I sense that you feel weird you
36:55 know Wow amazing Nostradamus maybe it's
36:59 your mustache lady I think personally
37:05 that and I'm not by any means profound
37:08 but I adopted the theory that is shared
37:11 among other people that our soul rides
37:16 our body probably not dissimilar to a
37:22 person riding a horse or to be more
37:25 accurate sort of a Tron Legacy light
37:29 cycle pilot who's just kind of gets on
37:32 the back of this bike is said meet
37:34 originally designed it and he just
37:36 becomes a
37:37 the bike you know it's ubiquitous it's
37:42 also sort of symbiotic right when you
37:47 die anyone who can remember that
37:49 experience I did just meet someone who
37:50 you had a near-death experience but you
37:55 pass away and if you do have any visions
37:57 you are seeing yourself on the ground
38:00 and you're floating as if you came off
38:03 the bike right and no one has any fear
38:06 no one has any pain in fact quite the
38:10 absolute opposite of everything that
38:13 everyone fears about death is the
38:16 unanimous the [ __ ] unanimous
38:19 experience of everyone who has a
38:21 near-death experience and has anything
38:22 to say about it they have an absolutely
38:25 euphoric SuperDuper lucid sometimes
38:29 adventurous experiences so what do we
38:34 have to fear man right that's a
38:36 digression statement but no I used an
38:40 analogy in season one I'm sure somewhere
38:43 but I probably did it once let's repeat
38:44 it as we end season three take your
38:49 fingers off one of your hands if you
38:51 preferably have missed any if you're
38:54 missing any fingers use the one that has
38:56 all five with erica's four fingers and a
38:58 thumb and extend your fingers down like
39:03 a little teepee and place them on a
39:06 surface it's really nice if you can do
39:09 on a glass table especially if you can
39:12 explain it to someone else let's pretend
39:15 you're doing on the glass table I know
39:16 that most of you can see this in your
39:18 brain because we all dream you can
39:21 imagine this inside your head imagine it
39:24 perfectly that's because you're way more
39:25 and any scientist has ever told you that
39:28 you are but as your fingers make contact
39:33 with the glass you know and you look
39:34 underneath the glass you can see your
39:35 fingers being you know flattened out
39:39 imagine that the tips of your fingers
39:42 touching the table the table is the
39:45 medium by which we exist in this
39:47 universe it is the fabric of ether wind
39:50 that is this particular form of life and
39:53 your fingertips ours are the souls that
39:57 have now combined with that plane of
40:02 existence to create us to give birth to
40:05 us the reason why I like the hand is
40:10 that it keeps a central unit above five
40:17 souls of course I'm not being literal
40:20 about five but think about it that's a
40:23 hand on the outside of this analogy the
40:27 tree of life comes back up to the palm
40:32 now have you ever felt like your best
40:36 friend was been your best friend in
40:38 other worlds other life's perhaps you
40:42 find the right spouse man you know you
40:43 don't have to keep every boyfriend and
40:45 girlfriend you have to have this feeling
40:47 you know you know there's this idea of a
40:49 soulmate maybe I don't know sometimes
40:53 you'll have a kid and you'll swear to
40:56 God they have personality traits of your
41:00 ancestors and of course there's genetic
41:02 programming that can definitely make
41:03 that occur for sure but what help what
41:06 stops the hand from picking up the
41:09 finger the index finger moving it over
41:12 half an inch and putting it back down
41:13 and being reborn into the same universe
41:17 now I have no idea obviously how this
41:20 actually occurs but I do believe that
41:23 when you look at a dead body in a casket
41:26 it's a very healthy experience and I
41:29 think the reason why the ritual was
41:30 created was so that you could see the
41:34 vessel without a soul and feel it feel
41:40 that there is no soul in that body and
41:45 doesn't mean we shouldn't honor the body
41:47 it just means your loved ones gone from
41:51 that
41:52 it might be standing right next to you
41:54 while you're doing the whole open casket
41:55 thing we need to advance the discussion
42:01 in my opinion of how ether winds would
42:04 affect what we are and we also need to
42:09 have the courage to acknowledge what is
42:15 actually occurring in our sight in our
42:18 hearts right when you see a body that's
42:22 alive and has a feeling when you see a
42:24 body that's not alive it has a different
42:26 feeling and what's interesting is if you
42:30 think about the pavlo nian training I
42:33 used to teach my students this if i sat
42:38 one of you down and at a really high res
42:41 pictures of your loved one and flashed
42:45 in front of your face I personally
42:49 believe that the brain first split
42:51 second believes that they're they're
42:53 depending on that you know how it's
42:55 presented to you the Lighting's correct
42:56 and it's not you know being blown out by
42:58 a Sun behind me or behind you or
43:00 whatever for a split second your brain
43:02 thinks that they're there and then your
43:04 brain is to go oh no that's a photograph
43:06 I think if you were to go up to some of
43:10 these tribes out there and show them a
43:13 picture of their wife or their husband
43:14 from the tribe in a really high-def
43:16 printed you know I don't know twenty-six
43:19 hundred dpi SuperDuper color laser
43:21 writer with gloss finish and a
43:24 controlled lighting experiment they're
43:26 gonna be looking at that photograph like
43:27 a cat looks at something in a computer
43:31 screen it tries to go around the screen
43:32 when it jumps off the screen we see this
43:36 all the time in animals right so here's
43:38 the thing when you see someone in a
43:41 casket and this still relates to what
43:43 I'm talking about here it's your ability
43:46 to sense what's there and what's not
43:48 there that's what I'm trying to get out
43:49 here have leniently speaking unless you
43:54 know I mean open caskets are usually
43:55 reserved for folks that are fairly
43:57 normal looking when they pass away right
44:02 you're seeing someone sleep
44:05 it's sort of what you're seeing
44:08 especially if the makeups done right and
44:10 the hair is done correct and clothes
44:11 work out I've been to some pretty young
44:13 funerals in my lifetime where the
44:15 person's face was perfectly fine that's
44:19 some serious stuff but my brain for no
44:24 microsecond no nanosecond had to
44:27 negotiate what I was looking at and when
44:31 you first come up on a body that's in a
44:33 casket you you feel like it's not your
44:36 loved one at least I do but then when
44:40 you look at them if you have the time to
44:42 do so it's them it's totally them
44:45 there's nothing wrong they didn't get it
44:47 wrong then get the hair wrong you can
44:48 get the face didn't change shape it's
44:50 still my buddy
44:52 but my brain and my soul and my mind
44:56 knows it's not them people who work in
45:00 hospice used to have a good friend in
45:02 this they'll tell you when you find
45:05 someone in their bed and they've passed
45:09 you can tell just by looking at their
45:11 face just by going up next to the body
45:13 you can tell they're not there anymore
45:14 you don't need to feel their pulse you
45:16 can but you don't need to you know
45:18 what's gonna happen of course you have
45:19 to confirm at some point I think that
45:22 that is sort of the clue the proof David
45:30 Icke does a great bit where he talks
45:31 about his mother passing and he he he
45:36 said you know I've had a big giant
45:38 picture of her made for the funeral and
45:40 I said that's my mom in that photograph
45:43 but she's not in this room she's not in
45:45 that body you know if our souls are
45:49 running piggyback on our body then it's
45:54 interesting it might explain dreaming it
45:59 might explain why we have to sleep maybe
46:03 but even the soul needs a break from the
46:06 body there's a really weird thing that
46:09 can occur when you miss sleep and you've
46:12 all experienced this you lay down at
46:17 night and you're exhausted
46:19 got your eyes closed and you keep them
46:22 closed for 99% of the entire time that
46:26 you've got in bed at midnight and got
46:29 out of bed maybe at 8 o'clock 9 o'clock
46:31 in the morning for what for but for
46:33 whatever reason you never fell asleep
46:36 but you kept your eyes closed right for
46:42 the most part and then you get up at 8
46:44 o'clock maybe you've had five hours of
46:46 sleep but you really needed the full
46:48 eight but what hurts your eyes hurt
46:52 right your eyes hurt and sting and burn
46:56 like you had them open all night but you
47:00 didn't you had them closed they should
47:02 be completely moisturized and you
47:05 weren't necessarily [ __ ] so they
47:07 shouldn't be tired you're just kind of
47:09 staring straight ahead with your head on
47:11 your bed so why do they burn I'm not
47:15 sure about that what do they talk about
47:17 what do they talk about when they talk
47:18 about the eyes the eyes are the windows
47:21 into the soul hmm what if that is way
47:27 more literal than you could possibly
47:29 imagine now we know how eyes work
47:32 physically from the retina I'll be back
47:35 to the visual cortex and we're not quite
47:39 sure how the wiring but we can mess with
47:40 the visual cortex we can watch what
47:43 you're thinking watch what you're seeing
47:45 every once in a while by the way you'll
47:47 read that paper about colleges and
47:49 various research centers that have been
47:51 able to look at what you're imagining
47:54 and I find that a little hard to believe
47:56 but you know I believe the last one I
47:59 saw actually had physical you know
48:01 photographs I once was spending a lot of
48:07 time programming a couple years ago
48:12 maybe a little more in a couple of me
48:14 four years ago and I was just staying up
48:16 late and I was working I'm working I'm
48:18 working like 12 hour days on this
48:19 special project of my own and go to bed
48:25 and I would be up 36 hours and I'd lay
48:28 down and you've heard me talk about this
48:30 kind of experience for a while but I was
48:31 really
48:33 SuperDuper studying how my brain was
48:37 processing the process of being utterly
48:41 exhausted because I thought you know
48:42 like I said in an episode that will air
48:45 after this one called dreamed a dream
48:48 development developing dreams I forgot
48:52 what I said anyway trying to sense
48:55 yourself actually falling asleep staying
48:57 conscious through the transfer from
49:00 consciousness to dream world and
49:02 watching the process happen like you're
49:04 getting on a subway and it's just all
49:06 the stuffs going by the windows or any
49:07 like damn
49:08 Lightspeed right but what I was trying
49:13 to sense was my consciousness which I
49:17 would also refer to as my soul I tried
49:20 to recognize where it was in 3d space so
49:23 here I am lying down in a bed lying down
49:25 on a pillow
49:26 I like those phone you know phone
49:31 pillows or it's larger on one side and
49:33 it's not support your neck it's what I
49:34 sleep on
49:35 I dig those recommended remember for
49:38 everyone but I'm laying down and my
49:40 consciousness felt like a teardrop that
49:42 was measurably behind my skull like
49:46 hanging way outside the back of my skull
49:48 probably I don't know ten inches at the
49:51 back of my head and it was almost as if
49:55 the I was so exhausted that whatever was
49:58 holding my consciousness to my body was
50:01 going we gotta get out of here we gotta
50:03 get outta this kid's gotta get to sleep
50:05 I don't know if you got a chance to hear
50:07 that that was a cat that small footnote
50:12 I worry about you guys driving and
50:14 hearing crap like that because I can
50:15 freak you out I don't want you to break
50:18 your car but in one of the sessions I
50:22 had this vision just popped into my head
50:28 and they say when you're really really
50:30 tired your right brain has gone to sleep
50:31 or sorry your left brain has gone to
50:33 sleep a long time ago and your right
50:34 brain is taking over so you will get
50:36 more creative thoughts when you are
50:39 really exhausted a lot of artists will
50:42 force themselves to stay up or even
50:44 scientists their theoretical scientists
50:46 they'll stay up
50:46 to keep their right brain dominant maybe
50:52 that's why I'm creative because I stay
50:53 up really really late I just I'm up
50:55 right now you can't hear any birds right
50:57 the occasional cat freaked out about it
51:01 probably a possum but the vision I got
51:04 was an orbital pattern it doesn't make
51:08 any orbital sense in my brain because if
51:11 you had two colliding orbits they're
51:13 only going to crossover for a very short
51:16 period of time not for a prolonged
51:18 period of time and then get out a loop
51:20 from each other right but maybe some
51:22 weird elliptical orbit would overlaid on
51:24 top of a circular orbit would account
51:26 for this but it was as if my soul was
51:30 saying we have to have to orbit out from
51:35 this thing we we have a cycle like the
51:41 Sun like the earth around the Sun you
51:45 see it all the time but I can't feel
51:49 feeling my consciousness fall out of my
51:51 skull it would fall and it would come
51:54 back and fall and it would come back
51:55 right
51:56 so we fall to sleep ever wonder where
52:00 these little statements come from I mean
52:02 I suppose the as children we think that
52:05 when someone says fall asleep we're
52:06 thinking about someone falling down and
52:08 going to sleep I think as soon as you
52:10 hit the ground you wake up unless you're
52:11 drunk right but falling asleep is an
52:15 interesting concept right you ever get
52:18 in your car in the morning you're
52:23 showered you got your favorite clothes
52:24 on you man you packed everything perfect
52:26 into your car and you hop behind that
52:28 steering wheel and you feel like you are
52:30 one with your car
52:32 totally one with your car in a way that
52:35 you command it and then you drive for 12
52:38 hours or you have a nice two-hour
52:42 commute Anneli start stop start stop
52:46 start stop and you feel one with your
52:49 car but it's more like you've melted
52:50 into it and your ability to command it
52:53 is compromised right maybe you're just
52:56 tired too all that
52:59 compounded you're bored to death and
53:02 what happens you go and you rest and you
53:04 get back in the car the next day and you
53:05 feel like a million bucks you're totally
53:07 engaged with the vehicle mm-hmm could
53:11 that be a clue as silly as that analogy
53:14 is could that be a clue of how we engage
53:19 ourselves we'll think about how you have
53:21 the mastering of your body if you sleep
53:25 in what is it holiday in you wake up the
53:30 next day and you're willing you know
53:31 you're ready to negotiate a trade deal
53:33 with China and then after I don't know
53:37 18 hours of consciousness you are barely
53:41 able to you know stand up while you're
53:45 peeing does you just lost it all there's
53:50 the there's a West world analogy to this
53:53 but I'm gonna use Star Trek instead in
53:55 the series Voyager which was mid
53:58 nineties they had a holographic doctor
54:01 which was actually I think a concept
54:03 pulled from probably some old sci-fi
54:06 novels but it was actually really
54:07 beautifully dramatized in Red Dwarf the
54:09 British comedy series sci-fi comedy
54:11 series but the holographic doctor had an
54:14 dilemma at the very beginning he was not
54:18 supposed to be on for prolonged periods
54:21 of time because as Westworld would call
54:25 it fidelity starts to waver meaning how
54:30 accurate do you remain who you are as if
54:34 the programming it's just not meant to
54:37 do this and when the doctor's case he
54:39 wasn't supposed to amass that much
54:41 experience inside of his core databanks
54:44 he was supposed to come in triage go
54:47 back out and be reset and the program
54:49 just keeps going and going and going but
54:53 it keeps getting reset what if it was
54:58 something as simple as this the soul
55:04 lacks fidelity with the body it can only
55:09 be directly attached to the body
55:13 a certain amount of time and then it has
55:16 to let go
55:17 so that it can get back on the horse the
55:20 next day crawl back behind the car
55:22 steering well the next day maybe the
55:27 body is just such a chaotic turbulent
55:30 thing that as you hang on to it it moves
55:35 you right and I forgot there's got to be
55:39 like a couple analogies like that where
55:40 I'm it used to be that thing that was
55:44 the tube looked like a fleshy tube and
55:46 it came out in the like late 80s and
55:49 they're full of water and it's an
55:51 inverted tube of water and you try to
55:56 hang on to it and it just slips out of
55:58 your hand and you grab it and it just
55:59 slips out of your hand because it's it's
56:01 an if it's an infinite loop it's a
56:03 mobius strip of a balloon
56:06 well imagine that's sort of how it
56:08 happens you get on the horse but the
56:10 horse sort of morphs out from under you
56:13 because it is a moving thing it is the
56:17 ether wind construct it is band kind so
56:21 we got to separate and we got to come
56:22 back that's why we feel so good in the
56:24 morning yeah we feel so lousy and
56:27 discombobulated in the evening because
56:29 you were just trying to hang on to those
56:32 [Music]
56:34 handlebars I'll give you another analogy
56:36 it's a little silly but anyone has
56:39 driven a motorcycle that was super
56:41 powerful or you've talked to people who
56:43 have I've had this experience personally
56:47 once you get on a motorcycle and you
56:49 floor the [ __ ] out of it all right and
56:51 you had a big open highway whatever it
56:53 is it is so powerful but you know you
56:57 pull back on the throttle it's so
57:01 powerful that it starts to pull away
57:04 from you and you feel yourself falling
57:08 off this bike and because you are trying
57:11 to hang on to the steering wheel which
57:13 is also a throttle on one of your hands
57:16 you're increasing the throttle creasing
57:19 the force but trying not to to try to
57:23 hang onto the bike
57:25 you know if you can just if you could
57:28 just hop off and float and then get let
57:31 the bike go down and it's because you're
57:32 no longer giving it throttle and you can
57:34 hop back on and hey you're back at 20
57:36 miles an hour it's feel pretty it feels
57:38 pretty good right I keep trying to
57:40 figure out what we have to sleep I still
57:43 don't know why your eyes burn I don't
57:46 know what's making and burn seriously
57:49 what's making your eyes burn the only
57:52 thing that makes sense to me is when I
57:55 stay up late and I go a 36-hour shift
57:57 with my eyes open I've added another 12
58:01 hours onto an already 24-hour day amen I
58:05 typically don't try to stay awake more
58:06 than 16 hours a day I don't try to do
58:10 that sadly it happens more often than
58:12 I'd like there's all these mysteries
58:16 right in front of us all these mysteries
58:20 but we're so wrapped up in [ __ ] in
58:22 this world we don't pay attention to
58:24 anything
58:25 well the huge benefits I have by doing
58:28 this show is that I keep visiting it and
58:32 visiting it sometimes I revisit things
58:35 because I need to do another episode
58:36 I feel like hey let's do a part too we
58:39 won't necessarily call it part two but
58:41 it'll be a part two - in a previous
58:42 episode but what I find is by doing I
58:47 don't know the course of a year a
58:49 hundred episodes a hundred and fifty
58:51 hours worth of stuff I keep it really
58:55 lucid in my brain I continually analyze
58:58 it and it just changes the way I see the
59:02 entire universe now like I've said in
59:05 previous episodes I'm hoping that this
59:08 is having an effect on you as well and
59:10 I'm hoping that regardless of your
59:12 academic certification right by some
59:18 college is going to give you a piece of
59:19 paper regardless of all that crap I hope
59:23 that you're able to understand virtually
59:25 everything I'm saying it's easy to
59:27 understand and that regardless if you've
59:29 ever touched science in your life you
59:31 are capable of saying I get it that's
59:35 cool and again I want you guys when you
59:38 hear this kind of
59:39 if it seems a little hard to follow do
59:46 me a couplet but it seems interesting to
59:48 you right if it doesn't seem interesting
59:49 you I'm not trying to force you into
59:50 this but if it's interesting to you but
59:53 you're like man I didn't really follow
59:54 it please listen to the episode enough
59:58 times that you get it and you know you
60:01 can ask me to describe things for you in
60:02 more detail if you're like in the
60:04 comments section on YouTube you're like
60:05 look I dug this episode but what the
60:07 hell were you talking about when you're
60:08 talking about this this and this I will
60:10 explain it in words until you get it and
60:13 there's this is there's a reason to my
60:15 madness here let's take the image of
60:19 your 1950's Leave It to Beaver housewife
60:23 okay as she graduate high school maybe
60:26 she got a degree don't know doesn't
60:29 matter I'm mentioning her for a reason
60:32 I'm not sure any of you or her
60:35 because I don't know if that jobs
60:37 available anymore in this world but
60:39 let's say you had someone like that and
60:41 for whatever crazy kooky reason she
60:44 found this show and this interest her
60:47 because she's like look I'm really
60:48 really smart my family's got a lot of
60:50 brilliant people in it I got pretty good
60:51 genetics I haven't been repressed by
60:53 society and so I've lived a really good
60:57 uninsured filled life right and she's
61:02 listening and listening I think that
61:06 that calm brain that calm mind with all
61:10 of the accoutrement of brilliance that
61:13 all of us have is the most likely brain
61:17 to hear one of these deeper theories and
61:20 go oh you mean life is like this and she
61:25 comes up with the metaphor that is 50
61:28 times better than anything I've ever
61:29 told you hopefully she'll get on the
61:32 keyboard and type it in and we all get
61:35 to learn so if you are more complex than
61:39 that life you're some technical person I
61:43 don't mean necessarily computers or
61:45 electronics but your technical and what
61:47 you do right an athlete is technical and
61:50 what they do right you're meticulous you
61:52 know
61:53 moving parts and talent and skill and
61:55 you work it all together into some
61:56 mishmash that is your talent and your
61:58 love then I think that your well it goes
62:05 both ways
62:05 one I think you'll have a lot of
62:09 metaphors in your own brain and your
62:11 your own history to take these theories
62:13 way further the only upshot that means
62:16 are the only downfall that you have
62:18 potentially is indoctrination you know
62:22 if you hug a equals mc-squared yeah you
62:26 really are going to science class with a
62:29 you know Hannibal Lecter muzzle on your
62:32 face or you look like the album of Quiet
62:34 Riot your gag you're in a straightjacket
62:38 your brain isn't isn't invited to think
62:41 when it needs to and it wants to its
62:43 hungry and I hope that this show
62:47 consistently rips those shackles off of
62:49 you if nothing else rips the shackles
62:52 away from you you don't have to listen
62:54 to my stuff that's trying to be put on
62:56 you in terms of another paradigm another
62:58 may be potentially shackle but my
63:01 theories are hopefully always open-ended
63:03 theories that go there's the frontier
63:06 guys oh it may have limits out there but
63:09 I don't see him and I'm not trying to
63:12 get you to see him you know you know
63:15 there's that funny CG of someone
63:19 creating a city in the clouds
63:21 it's brilliantly done in China there's
63:24 like a city up in the clouds it's
63:26 beautifully done I mean it's definitely
63:27 a special effect people but what if that
63:31 was real what if that was real once a
63:34 year let's just romanticize this into a
63:37 story once a year a big giant fog front
63:40 comes in to China wherever Half Moon Bay
63:46 and in that one day and whatever it is 2
63:51 hours 30 minutes you can see a whole
63:53 nother world up inside the clouds and it
63:58 is beyond beautiful and happy and
64:03 brilliant to your mind you're looking at
64:05 that going
64:06 what the [ __ ] you know how is there a
64:10 city in the clouds and of course someone
64:15 who's gonna own a plane or a helicopter
64:17 is gonna go visit just think about the
64:21 euphoria going through your body I mean
64:24 hopefully they don't have a missile
64:25 system you don't need any Nagre theá--
64:28 experience right but you go up there and
64:32 you're you just land somewhere you're in
64:35 a whole different world and you know
64:37 that if you make it so say we all know
64:40 the windows 30 minutes it takes you so
64:43 much time to scramble into your plane
64:46 maybe take a helicopter II specifically
64:48 because it's more strategic in landing
64:50 and you takes a while to get the
64:52 altitude maybe even as you approach it
64:56 it starts to kind of move back because
64:58 the clouds start disappearing but you
64:59 managed to land on top of a building top
65:01 land on the street and you look back
65:05 behind you and earth disappears wherever
65:09 they go for that 365 day thing you know
65:13 cuz they're only there for 30 minutes
65:14 once a year you're in it for one year
65:17 you're on a tourist trip way up inside
65:20 the clouds how exciting is that right
65:24 meet a whole nother I don't know what
65:26 the hell that is right maybe it's heaven
65:28 maybe it's just some crazy eccentric
65:31 people like in Bioshock right they've
65:36 created a city in the sky or city in the
65:39 ocean and you get to visit
65:43 I want these theories to appeal to you
65:46 like that a whole new frontier of
65:49 thinking it's gonna make you think in
65:52 ways you never thought before but it's
65:54 also gonna make you think of things
65:55 you've never thought before from the
65:58 abstract to the specific from the unbias
66:02 to the bias right my encouragement to
66:05 you is to say it could be that's sort of
66:09 how I put it all down on paper it could
66:12 be this it could be that eventually the
66:16 could B's will solidify
66:18 things will connect very powerfully in
66:21 your mind and that's when you're really
66:25 cooking with gas man you become a new
66:29 expert and how things work I've been
66:33 privileged in my lifetime to handle
66:35 technology that the world hasn't seen
66:37 yet and I'm like maybe one of 20 people
66:40 in the world who's ever seen a
66:42 particular form of technology for the
66:44 very first time so I'm like an early
66:47 adopter I get in early and I become an
66:50 expert at it very very quickly and I
66:52 know all the limitations of it I'm
66:54 creative person so I can use it in ways
66:56 that the original creator never intended
66:59 and so the Creator is excited oh my god
67:01 I birthed the child I'm like yeah man
67:03 this is great keep it come and keep you
67:04 keep making the tools I'll keep making
67:06 the solutions right the experiences well
67:10 it's just like that you open your mind
67:13 you see a new frontier you hop in I mean
67:17 isn't it cool if you had a really long
67:18 commute the cool thing is is you could
67:21 listen to this episode a couple times
67:22 and it could turn a whole new world in
67:26 your brain nothing I've ever mentioned I
67:29 just simply give you the primer and then
67:32 it's like the tape runs out on this
67:34 episode right the music's over and your
67:37 brain is just off at a whole another
67:38 world and you're thinking of things
67:40 again I have never mentioned you were
67:44 literally Daniel Boone out there in the
67:46 universe attaching wires together and
67:49 messing around with stuff I'm giving you
67:52 tools you go create the solutions you
67:56 create the next level of science next
67:58 level of discovery now if you bump into
68:02 someone who says you're crazy
68:04 whatever whatever that's their problem
68:07 if they want to debate you on something
68:09 and you can change your mind about one
68:12 of the connections that's fine that
68:14 cognition doesn't look like it touches
68:16 to the other thing maybe it does in a
68:17 different condition right now what this
68:19 is that and this is that all these other
68:21 conditions I mean it doesn't work I'll
68:25 come back to that let me go back to the
68:27 beginning
68:28 if you've ever taught in your life
68:31 or had teachers in your family one of
68:34 the things that they'll teach you really
68:36 quickly and what's funny is no one has
68:37 to tell you this it's a cliche and I
68:40 guarantee you you discover this cliche
68:42 by yourself
68:45 the second you want to teach something
68:47 is the day you realize you don't really
68:49 understand it or you do understand it
68:51 the first time I started teaching
68:53 classes you know I you get this weird
68:58 insecurity like oh my god do I
68:59 understand this enough to really teach
69:01 it to other people eventually go [ __ ]
69:03 yeah I do or a question comes at you
69:05 from the audience you're like oh yeah
69:07 well I wasn't going to talk about that
69:09 but if you're interested in how many
69:10 people are interested in it they always
69:11 are hands you're like okay great it's
69:13 been 15 20 minutes in this other area
69:17 since everyone's interested and they
69:18 just bake it into your agenda into your
69:20 syllabus anyway I know you guys fill me
69:23 you guys are the minds that think like
69:25 this that's why you're here my goal is
69:29 to keep your brain gone keep your brain
69:31 thinking all subjects in life anyhow if
69:35 you haven't gone to deep thoughts
69:36 radio.com please do there are 300 and
69:40 G's at least 320 episodes up there for
69:43 you to listen to only a few have you
69:46 made it through all of it for those of
69:48 you who've made it through all of it I
69:49 think I'll create a t-shirt for you guys
69:50 just get yourself a little trophy
69:53 because that's a quite accomplishment
69:55 man but the website has the audio of the
69:57 video of the LOC Facebook group the
69:59 patreon page and the store so until we
70:04 meet again take care of yourself and
70:05 someone else and I'll see in the next
70:07 deep thoughts
70:11 you
70:12 [Music]
