00:35 welcome back ladies and gentlemen the
00:38 deep thoughts
00:40 you know must be crazy when people join
00:42 this channel for the very first time
00:44 they have no idea what's going on like
00:46 this guy's done videos before who's this
00:48 guy
00:50 all right bermuda triangle
00:53 as promised now if you're like me and i
00:58 think in the modern age with younger
00:59 kids
01:00 you're not like me let me know
01:04 back in the 70s and 80s they really
01:09 uh built up and sensationalized
01:13 this area of the atlantic between
01:16 puerto rico the florida keys
01:20 roughly and the island of bermuda that's
01:24 way north
01:26 the phrase was coined in 1964
01:30 and it's by uh it was a science fiction
01:33 magazine that actually coined the phrase
01:35 i'm going to try to say the name of this
01:36 right it's orgasi
01:39 magazine it could be orgosi because the
01:42 y should make the o long
01:44 sometimes why you know so up until that
01:47 point
01:48 things were happening in this area but
01:50 no one had really
01:52 you know coined the phrase bermuda
01:54 triangle until the sci-fi mag did it
01:58 which is pretty cool i guess
02:02 they used to call them the devil's
02:03 islands
02:05 and the isles of the devils
02:08 because of the fact that people would
02:11 travel from europe
02:13 and not know really anything about
02:14 tropical environments
02:16 or the indigenous life that lives in
02:19 those areas and so they land on this
02:20 mysterious island
02:22 of bermuda again this isn't about
02:26 bermuda itself but bermuda is a wild
02:28 location i had no idea until i did
02:30 research on this
02:33 but we'll get to that one second but
02:35 they would land on this island and also
02:36 hear all these uh amazing
02:41 sounds and there's the
02:45 cacao bird i don't know if it's cacao or
02:48 cahao
02:50 and it would you know screech at night
02:52 and they didn't know where it was and
02:54 it's a rare bird that only exists
02:56 on bermuda island and probably
02:57 neighboring little teeny islands
02:59 and so imagine you've been a lot of
03:01 places you never heard that sound before
03:04 right plus apparently as the
03:07 conquistadors kept
03:08 coming over to america one of the
03:11 classic things they did in america was
03:13 in south america was that they were
03:16 smart
03:17 to bring pigs because pigs
03:20 procreate pretty quickly and boy are
03:22 they tasty right
03:23 so these pigs would get loose as well on
03:26 the island and so you'd hear the
03:27 screeching of pigs
03:29 and so just kind of turn into this
03:32 spooky location
03:34 way before we have our modern day
03:37 problems with this area
03:38 of of the ocean
03:42 now obviously there's a tremendous
03:44 amount of theories as to what's going on
03:46 in this region
03:48 from natural things that we're going to
03:50 talk about all the way up to like the
03:52 crazy
03:53 crazier more open-minded theories of
03:55 like
03:56 aliens and i will say that i watched a
03:59 ton of videos
04:00 i did a a moderate amount of reading
04:03 obviously wiki wikipedia and that kind
04:06 of stuff
04:07 and just you know browse some theories
04:11 and it's very interesting how it's kind
04:13 of coming together
04:16 with a bunch of really fairly decent
04:19 suggestions of how things could occur
04:21 some totally surprising ones to me which
04:23 are very
04:24 scientifically possible and
04:27 i mean very realistic in the laboratory
04:31 but what i found interesting was that
04:32 when they started talking about ufos
04:35 taking people away which no one's ever
04:38 said they saw
04:38 ufo as a part of one of these
04:41 disappearances
04:43 you'll hear the same person who's
04:45 throwing all this other stuff at you
04:48 kind of say well i don't doesn't make
04:50 any sense why ufos would be in this
04:52 region and why they would take anybody
04:54 away
04:56 there's some reasons i got my hoodie on
04:59 today because uh
05:01 let's see it's a nice
05:05 warm 44 degrees out
05:09 so now depending on who you talk to you
05:11 get all kinds of
05:12 different reports about how much has
05:14 gone wrong in this area
05:17 and how other governments view this area
05:21 as potentially a threat or not a threat
05:23 so you hear just completely different
05:25 things
05:26 the lowest number i've heard was 2 000
05:30 ships 150 aircraft the highest number
05:33 i've heard is 3 000
05:35 ships and 150 aircraft so the aircraft's
05:39 pretty locked down
05:40 but in terms of ships pretty bad
05:44 3 000 since they started tracking this
05:47 way back in the 1800s
05:51 i'm going to kick off with the ships
05:53 because chronologically they go first
05:55 and christopher columbus who's
05:57 technically the first person to have the
05:59 capability of writing his language down
06:02 in a first world source from a first
06:05 world source
06:06 saw some things as he was journeying
06:08 over here
06:10 but apparently to this day five ships a
06:13 year disappear in this area
06:17 that sounds pretty significant however i
06:19 will tell you right off the bat
06:21 apparently according to one of the
06:23 sources
06:25 the united states military slash navy i
06:27 should say
06:29 has never earmarked bermuda region that
06:32 bermuda triangle region as being an
06:34 inordinate threat it's not even in the
06:36 top 10.
06:37 apparently it's not even in the top 20.
06:40 but
06:41 the reasons why the reasons that have
06:44 been prophesized or theorized i should
06:46 say
06:47 as to why these ships disappear
06:50 are capable of sinking just about
06:53 anything from an aircraft carrier all
06:55 the way down to
06:56 any naval ship that's out there so it
06:59 would seem as if this would be
07:01 definitely on the list and not
07:03 necessarily for anything
07:06 enemy combatant or ufos but for all the
07:09 natural things that i'm going to share
07:10 with you
07:12 that i discovered
07:15 now because there are thousands of
07:18 missing ships
07:19 and hundreds of missing planes
07:22 my review of some of the
07:26 disappearance is going to be fairly
07:27 abbreviated simply because
07:29 it gets really boring really fast but
07:31 the the difference in species
07:34 of these disappearances is where
07:37 some of the myth gets tempered
07:41 and then some of the myth gets launched
07:45 if you will now christopher columbus
07:49 depending on who you hear tell the story
07:53 he was sailing from spain all the way
07:57 down to
07:58 what ended up being was this uh uh was
08:01 it
08:02 san salvador or something like that he
08:03 was
08:05 no i was thinking the first island he
08:06 landed named after his mother i think
08:08 that's the way the
08:09 movie 1492 talked about it
08:12 i'm not a giant christopher columbus fan
08:14 because once you really get into his
08:16 history
08:17 it's pretty clear he was really taking
08:21 advantage of the fact that he was away
08:22 from home
08:25 he had a military that would protect him
08:28 and so
08:29 you know i you know who knows they'll
08:32 make claims about the guy and you know
08:34 when am i going to fly to spain to try
08:35 to figure out whether or not it's true
08:36 or not
08:37 why would they want to take a crap on a
08:39 person that i think is a hero in spain
08:41 don't know i mean
08:42 they didn't get to keep america so maybe
08:44 he's a traitor i don't know
08:46 apparently christopher columbus dies in
08:48 florida south florida
08:51 hiding from the authorities in spain
08:54 for all kinds of stuff from
08:57 taking gold away from the queen
09:01 to pedophilia to
09:04 raping and murdering the locals i mean
09:06 it got bad
09:09 now there are different anomalies that
09:11 he supposedly noted in his log coming
09:13 from spain
09:15 if you look at the log versus the time
09:18 that the log entry was made and how fast
09:21 we know his ships
09:22 moved virtually 90 percent of everything
09:25 if not 95
09:26 everything that he reported in his log
09:28 as an anomaly
09:30 was in the waters far preceding
09:34 anything in this bermuda triangle which
09:36 again is
09:37 the northern bermuda island down to
09:40 puerto rico
09:41 over to florida however when he gets
09:45 really close
09:46 to land which
09:50 is strange because it's not the florida
09:52 keys but he said uh
09:54 he had seen lights in the sky
09:58 and then what people forget is that
10:01 in his own log two hours later they hit
10:03 land
10:05 so what they think he might have been
10:07 seeing if it wasn't just
10:08 interesting plasma storms that perhaps
10:10 do not occur in spain
10:12 i never been to spain i don't know i
10:14 know that in the united states where i
10:16 come from
10:17 in kansas we have storms that are like
10:21 unreal we have lots of tornadoes we have
10:23 black clouds and i mean
10:25 black clouds that'll show up in the
10:27 middle of summer
10:28 and monsoonas
10:32 but he may have been seeing lights which
10:34 were
10:35 technically just fires in the hills away
10:39 from his boat and of course
10:41 you know being at sea for an extended
10:42 period of time you would have
10:44 to assume that the senses would be
10:47 extremely
10:48 powerful because you're in a deprivation
10:50 situation
10:52 so they dragged christopher columbus
10:54 into this
10:56 and the year was 1492 october 11th
11:01 now the the interesting thing is is like
11:05 i'll hear notes about
11:09 for instance leaping forward to 2015.
11:12 there is a vessel with a bunch of cargo
11:15 stuff on it
11:17 and it was called
11:21 the ssl faro had 33
11:24 crew members on board and they reported
11:27 this and i just watched this uh
11:29 report that said this is like the the
11:31 most deadly
11:32 one since this whole anomaly has been
11:34 discovered and maybe that's true from
11:36 1964.
11:38 but you dial back to 1800 when the uss
11:43 pickering disappeared
11:47 headed towards delaware from the
11:49 galapagos islands
11:50 lost 90 people now here's the thing
11:54 about the ships that disappear
11:56 and here's what's interesting about the
11:57 whole thing
11:59 ships are disappearing like
12:01 instantaneously
12:03 meaning whatever occurs to the ship
12:07 is so sudden and so violent that
12:09 captains don't have the chance to grab a
12:11 radio and scream mayday
12:13 or ask for any help at all it does
12:15 happen
12:16 but a lot of times it doesn't matter if
12:19 it's a giant tanker
12:21 a modern day shipping container kind of
12:23 vehicle or
12:24 a ship back in 1800 these
12:27 vehicles apparently get destroyed
12:31 super quick another one
12:34 1814 remember the 39
12:38 which god bless their souls i hope
12:40 they're on a ufo going somewhere
12:44 lost 140 people just just disappears
12:49 now this area of the world is no mystery
12:52 to most people
12:53 in terms of the fact that most
12:55 hurricanes are created off the coast of
12:58 uh to you guys off the coast of africa
13:00 and then they head over
13:02 to the americas and of course i'm going
13:04 to the gulf some pound
13:05 cuba and puerto rico and the bahamas and
13:08 all those islands over there
13:10 apparently my layman's knowledge is is
13:12 that the less that your civilization
13:15 goes vertical in terms of structures
13:18 the the less you suffer from
13:22 a hurricane i know that shanty houses
13:26 and stuff get knocked down but it just
13:27 seems like the bigger you are the more
13:29 you can run into some serious issues
13:31 the only hurricane that i remember
13:33 scorching the earth was
13:36 andrew way back when i was young katrina
13:38 did a horrible thing but that was mostly
13:40 flooding
13:41 issues all of them being horrific
13:46 we have uss wildcat gets knocked out in
13:48 1824
13:50 there's a dispute as to how many people
13:51 pass from 14 to 31
13:55 and sometimes they will find the ship
13:57 without the crew
14:01 very interesting stuff a lot of times
14:03 they'll find the ship
14:04 with partial crew and they will
14:08 tell you what happened you know they had
14:09 a bilge pump that didn't work and that
14:11 sort of thing
14:13 so i'm gonna say this much if you're
14:16 terribly interested in all of the
14:17 disappearances
14:20 i didn't find in all the research that i
14:22 did that any one of the ships
14:23 super duper stands out except for the
14:25 more modern ones
14:28 where they're cargo ships
14:32 with a bunch of modern equipment and
14:34 they just totally disappear and
14:36 sometimes
14:36 again they reappear with no crew on them
14:39 i mean it's just the most bizarre thing
14:41 if the ship can survive and not end up
14:43 on the bottom of the ocean
14:45 you would assume that someone could hide
14:47 in a compartment i mean there's
14:48 compartments inside ship
14:50 valves that are completely waterproof
14:53 and so there's some really interesting
14:56 stuff
14:57 now let's touch on briefly
15:00 bermuda island because this is
15:02 fascinating and i never knew this man
15:05 that island is sitting on the mushroom
15:09 cap
15:10 of a derelict dead volcano
15:14 that goes down approximately i think
15:17 i want to say the first drop off
15:22 is like 4 000 feet down so this island
15:25 has a volcano that goes up and it seems
15:28 to have
15:29 spewed a bunch of volcanic rock that
15:31 then
15:32 created like a tea or like again like a
15:35 mushroom top on
15:36 on the end of this but very collapsed
15:39 sort of one of your flat mushrooms i'll
15:40 show you guys pictures as i go along
15:42 here
15:43 and the islands are on the top and it's
15:46 a fairly tiny group of islands
15:47 it's very lush obviously when the
15:50 settlers
15:51 started coming in in the 1600s they were
15:54 pretty terrified of what they were
15:55 bumping into because they just didn't
15:56 know
15:57 and then things calmed down
16:00 place gets inhabited and
16:04 up until recently you could get
16:07 greeted by this gentleman
16:10 johnny barnes this black gentleman that
16:14 would
16:14 wave at you when you came to the island
16:16 he did it for a really really long time
16:18 and so much so
16:20 that they built a statue of him waving
16:22 and he stood next to the statue and he
16:23 would wave at you he's just this
16:25 endearing man that unfortunately after
16:28 2016
16:29 we're not going to be able to see him
16:30 anymore except his statue and i'm sure
16:32 his spirit is running around the island
16:34 what a great little thing but not too
16:37 far away from the bermuda
16:38 island you have a three mile drop down
16:41 to fifteen
16:42 thousand feet it's pretty huge
16:45 pretty huge for that area so this is a
16:47 very eccentric
16:48 place as well i'm gonna bleed in a
16:52 little bit of ethereal theory in here
16:54 because
16:55 we're talking about an area of the
16:58 earth's crust
17:00 that is extremely active now even though
17:03 there's a derelict
17:05 volcano that bermuda sits on top of
17:08 the area is reported to have pretty
17:11 massive
17:13 seismic shifting out there and during a
17:16 lot of the seismic shifting we're going
17:18 to have
17:19 huge plumes and i mean plumes probably
17:22 the size of small islands
17:24 of methane gas coming to the surface
17:27 which we'll talk about in just a few
17:28 minutes here
17:30 now the thing that blows me away is that
17:33 people who comment on ufo stuff
17:36 ignorantly it sort of
17:40 i just want people to say i don't know i
17:42 don't study that stuff and i have no
17:44 theories there
17:45 sounds far-fetched to me but then i
17:46 don't know right instead they
17:48 kind of crap on anything and then move
17:52 on
17:52 which always it's really just a hubris
17:54 that won't let go
17:56 to qualify themselves and so in the end
17:58 they um
18:00 kind of seem authoritative but they're
18:02 not looking at sort of some of the
18:04 ocean theories from like bill cooper and
18:06 other people
18:08 and i forgot what they call the ufos in
18:10 the water but you have an area
18:13 of the ocean that is volatile you have
18:16 an area that's very deep
18:18 and so if somebody was gonna put a
18:21 little observational base
18:24 a little abyss base on the bottom of the
18:26 ocean
18:27 you would potentially put it in an area
18:30 that's
18:30 warm and that has this active area and
18:34 maybe you're the reason why it's active
18:35 who knows right
18:37 so i am still a believer in bill cooper
18:40 when it comes to him seeing
18:44 ufos exit the ocean and re-enter the
18:47 ocean
18:47 as he said maybe everything he was told
18:49 after that
18:50 moment of his life when he got cue
18:52 clearance within the 24-hour period of
18:54 seeing these
18:56 along with other crewmen on the deck of
18:59 this ship
19:00 seeing it along with the radar
19:03 folks inside the ship saying they saw
19:06 vehicles just suddenly appear next to
19:08 the ship and fly away and then two more
19:10 come in and go into the ocean
19:12 it's too many people that
19:15 saw these and they're not the only
19:16 people in the world that have ever seen
19:17 these
19:19 to dismiss the fact that if you're going
19:21 to be
19:22 creating this environment whatever it is
19:25 or
19:26 flat earth matrix you just happen to
19:28 maintenance the earth or you created us
19:30 or whatever
19:32 them being at the bottom of the ocean
19:33 with technology
19:35 seems like it might make sense and who
19:37 knows it could be a proxy into something
19:38 much more interesting
19:41 but there are just tons
19:45 of these boat disappearances
19:50 now because we know hurricanes are there
19:53 and there's
19:53 all kinds of things there are funnels
19:56 like
19:56 uh water funnels that are like tornadoes
20:00 on the water
20:01 most of you've probably seen those in
20:02 your lifetime at least on tv
20:05 there's methane gas bubbles
20:08 that could sink a ship and you might
20:12 think what
20:13 what's going on there is a
20:16 little video i saw it was like more the
20:18 official channel stuff like bbc stuff
20:22 and there was a dude who was an expert
20:23 in fluid mechanics
20:25 he has a glass or sorry a plexiglas
20:29 cylinder he has a steel ball inside
20:32 simulating the boat hole the
20:34 displacement
20:36 and it's floating perfectly in the water
20:38 it's not it's just a little bit
20:40 above water most of it was underwater
20:42 but if it was a ship and it just would
20:43 have been like a normal
20:45 sailboat and a simulation this dude has
20:48 rigged a bunch of tubes at the bottom
20:50 to evenly distribute a tremendous amount
20:52 of air bubbles
20:54 not necessary methane because it would
20:55 be explosive in his laboratory
20:58 but it doesn't have anything to do with
20:59 it doesn't have anything to do with it
21:00 being methane but that
21:02 leads us back to the fact that crude oil
21:04 is not a fossil fuel it's compressed
21:06 methane gas because it's one of the most
21:07 ample things in the crust of the earth
21:09 and when you compress it
21:10 you simply exacerbate the chemistry
21:13 signature
21:14 of carbon and hydrogen and the reason
21:17 why we refine
21:18 oil is to get it back towards its
21:20 methane
21:22 composite when it originated
21:25 but what it has to do with just what it
21:27 has to do with is just the bubbles
21:30 the displacement of a hole against
21:33 ocean has to do with the fact that
21:35 you're trapping air inside of a hole
21:38 and then you're trying to push that air
21:39 down inside the ocean
21:41 when that occurs it's got buoyance it
21:44 pushes back
21:46 when you see the ocean with tons of
21:48 bubbles
21:49 around the ship you then pierce
21:52 the density of water with bubbles
21:56 and so now that pressure that's pushing
21:58 down the hole that's pushing down on the
22:00 water and the equation that makes
22:02 buoyancy
22:03 starts to disintegrate imagine this i
22:06 mean this is like
22:07 if you know anything about deep sea
22:10 ocean
22:11 anything even if you're just a fisherman
22:13 out there it's actually i think it's a
22:14 little more terrifying with a small boat
22:16 but i guess this happening on a giant
22:18 boat would be
22:20 quadruple terrifying you were out there
22:23 sailing
22:25 there's a titanic shift below you which
22:27 you don't hear
22:29 necessarily and then here comes
22:32 a football field sized bubble of
22:35 millions of little bubbles
22:37 up and around your ship and within
22:41 seconds your ship starts to
22:44 fall to the bottom of the ocean which
22:47 could be
22:48 up to fifteen thousand feet three miles
22:51 oh my god and let's say it's at
22:53 nighttime hell if it's even a daytime
22:55 might be even worse right you're so
22:56 lucidly going
22:57 oh my god it's like the kansas album
22:59 cover you know ship is going foof right
23:01 down into that hole
23:03 i think there's one that's like that now
23:06 water spouts as i said is another one
23:08 but i have to say water spouts would
23:09 probably be
23:11 very much on the realm of a smaller boat
23:14 you would imagine
23:16 one of the more recent theories
23:20 that's going on here is what they're
23:22 calling rogue
23:23 waves now rogue waves have been
23:26 theorized for
23:27 quite some time and it's different than
23:30 a tsunami
23:31 right we know how tsunami behaves
23:33 something seismic
23:34 seismic happens off the coast and that
23:38 reels back a gigantic amount of water
23:40 because the plate drops creating more
23:42 space inside the ocean to suck a huge
23:45 volumetric
23:47 amount of water out to sea and everyone
23:50 runs onto the
23:51 into the sand where they've never stood
23:54 before
23:55 without water being over their head and
23:57 you pick up rocks and
23:58 fish and everything and you're like ah
24:00 this is great and all of a sudden you
24:01 look up and you're like
24:02 what's that what's crazy about tsunamis
24:06 just as a small digression is
24:08 any of you've really looked into the
24:10 2004 tsunami
24:12 it's what 280 000 people perish
24:15 on many coasts it is a terrifying subtle
24:19 way to die you're like oh the water's
24:21 coming in wow that's interesting oh wait
24:22 wait wait wait wait
24:24 but the one that's utterly horrific from
24:27 my brain is all of the
24:28 japan videos from 2013.
24:32 and yes some of us believe it's a weapon
24:36 that's being tested
24:38 but these rogue waves don't need a
24:40 tsunami
24:42 rogue waves they're still theorizing
24:44 exactly how they occur but they're now
24:46 capable of tracking them with satellite
24:47 technology and aircraft
24:50 these waves average about 80 feet
24:54 which is an eight story building okay
24:57 theoretically
24:58 they've managed to simulate them in
25:00 water simulations which we've got down
25:01 pat i mean go see
25:03 pacific rim all the water is fake
25:06 up to almost 200 feet tall
25:10 wow huge now imagine
25:14 oh and some of the ways they're saying
25:16 is that uh
25:17 a lot of it could do with the contour or
25:19 the bottom of the ocean
25:21 but you could have two fairly large
25:24 waves
25:25 combine and hit each other and can
25:27 instead of canceling each other
25:29 they tend to multiply the frequencies up
25:31 you could have several small waves going
25:33 in a direction and they all multiply up
25:34 into that
25:35 beautiful piece of japanese art but
25:38 imagine you're in a pretty damn big
25:41 and an 8 to 20 story
25:45 wave and you know how nature works man
25:48 nature
25:48 will create like oh the biggest anaconda
25:50 in the whole world is 20 feet then all
25:52 of a sudden there's one that's like
25:53 a thousand feet long i mean nature does
25:55 that right
25:57 but you look up and you're like oh my
26:00 god
26:00 this is it if we make it through this
26:03 wave
26:04 which is a wave you know because most of
26:06 you know that
26:07 when you have a tsunami traveling across
26:09 the pacific or the atlantic if you're in
26:11 the ocean
26:13 yeah you'll definitely be thrown up and
26:15 down but it's a nice
26:16 long wave you're not getting splashed by
26:19 that perfect storm wave right like in
26:21 the movie
26:22 but if you hit a rogue wave you're
26:24 obviously going to get a big duck diving
26:26 surf maneuver with your entire ship
26:29 cargo and all now one of the things
26:32 that's
26:33 super mystifying to me about any of
26:35 these
26:36 theories and we're going to get through
26:38 some more here is that
26:42 big ships disappear with hundreds of
26:45 these containers on
26:46 on the ship this is what happens in the
26:48 modern day time right
26:50 so these ships you'd think even if the
26:53 ship went down
26:54 those containers are just on top the
26:56 containers fall off ships all the time
26:58 in the pacific
26:59 and end of fighting them floating around
27:00 somewhere now
27:02 can this can a container sink oh yeah
27:05 sure
27:06 i don't think that a lot of them are
27:07 completely sealed you know i'm not into
27:10 that business but
27:11 i'm assuming they have a little leak
27:12 here a little leak there so eventually
27:14 take on enough water and sink
27:16 it's obviously carrying something
27:19 but it seems kind of bizarre that a ship
27:22 will disappear
27:23 and they will put out a huge group of
27:25 people searching for
27:27 the wreckage and they can't find
27:30 anything and i know i know the ocean is
27:32 a really big
27:32 place and if even if someone told you we
27:34 searched a million square miles
27:37 it uh doesn't mean anything but now
27:41 one of the things that they don't really
27:44 have figured out in terms of and i
27:48 shouldn't say they don't have it figured
27:49 out because
27:49 how could i know but i didn't see anyone
27:52 make this correlation
27:54 blatantly they will say these two facts
27:58 between
27:58 boat and plane but no one stops the
28:01 documentary and goes
28:02 whoa that's a commonality between these
28:05 two
28:07 which is that the instruments especially
28:10 compasses
28:11 seem to have an anomaly where they
28:13 completely freak out
28:16 and you know sometimes what they'll say
28:18 is that they'll say to
28:20 amateur boat people with smaller boats
28:22 oh that's just because you
28:24 you have shorting equipment you got some
28:26 water splash in your system
28:28 and some of these guys have been fishing
28:30 out there for 20 30 years they're like
28:33 i've never had a short in my equipment
28:34 because when you have a short in your
28:36 equipment
28:37 you typically have to go get it fixed
28:38 you blow a fuse or something like that
28:40 and some of these guys i've never had
28:41 that happen
28:42 so i don't think i've ever had a short
28:44 but the interesting thing
28:45 about this flying
28:49 compass is that it hits planes and it
28:52 hits
28:53 the boats which means whatever is
28:54 happening happens at
28:56 sea level literally and it happens at
28:58 whatever altitude these planes are
29:00 flying
29:01 now the other thing is that the planes
29:05 that seem to be having the issues are
29:06 always small planes
29:09 or older planes like back in the 40s
29:12 they didn't have super high altitudes
29:15 and there's just some tragic stories of
29:17 these people
29:19 perishing out there i mean think about
29:21 it let's just say the three thousand two
29:23 three thousand one fifty numbers right
29:26 my god that's
29:27 3 150 vehicles disappearing and
29:29 multiplied times the people who
29:31 disappeared
29:32 in these events you have more than 911
29:36 right there it's it's a pretty big loss
29:38 you know but what would control an
29:41 electromagnetic
29:43 mechanism for functioning properly
29:47 now there was a distinction in that when
29:49 planes
29:50 get into this other thing which is uh
29:53 spatial disorientation which we're going
29:55 to talk about
29:57 modern planes have a lot of modern
29:59 equipment that do not rely
30:01 on more ancient equipment that is
30:02 electromagnetic compasses
30:05 in the dashboard of the plane so
30:08 there are other ways of figuring out
30:09 your orientation in a plane if you know
30:11 how to fly by instruments in modern day
30:12 times
30:14 what i didn't hear in any of the
30:15 documentaries it said that five people
30:17 are still
30:18 or sorry five vehicles disappear a year
30:20 is that
30:21 i'm not hearing that report on an
30:23 aeronautical level
30:24 like one plane disappears a year without
30:28 again
30:28 any sos no found
30:32 wreckage of any kind but now if you're a
30:35 buff
30:36 of bermuda and you're familiar with
30:38 close encounters of the third kind
30:40 by steven spielberg you'll be well aware
30:43 that the opening scene
30:46 where the french translator runs out to
30:49 the desert with a scientist he works for
30:53 they discover some planes
30:57 from flight 19 in the desert
31:01 i forget what desert it is i apologize
31:04 and there's a boat out there and i don't
31:06 know if the boat was ever liking to the
31:08 bermuda but it seems like that was sort
31:10 of the um
31:11 the gist of it but before we get into
31:15 flight 19 which happens in early
31:17 december
31:18 december 5th it's important to remember
31:21 that the same year
31:23 on july 10th that a
31:27 it was a navy patrol plane i guess
31:29 piloted by thomas arthur garner
31:32 takes off with a 10-man crew
31:36 and is never heard from again last time
31:39 they reported their position was 1 16
31:41 am now when i was listening to
31:46 the fishermen of bermuda and again it's
31:48 not always in the tip of the
31:50 triangle in fact a lot of these flights
31:53 and a lot of these
31:54 boats that have issues that are reported
31:56 in the bermuda triangle if you really
31:58 take a look at
31:59 their path on that particular day every
32:02 time
32:03 air traffic control saw someone every
32:04 time a radar got a ping back from a ship
32:07 they only passed through the bermuda
32:10 triangle
32:11 before they had other problems outside
32:13 of the bermuda triangle
32:14 and anytime that happens they always
32:16 blame it on the triangle so be careful
32:18 with your research
32:19 that might be why there's a discrepancy
32:20 between three thousand ships and two
32:22 thousand ships maybe somebody filtered
32:24 out a thousand ships
32:25 that only passed through it but didn't
32:28 perish in it
32:29 i don't know but the fisherman's made a
32:32 very interesting statement that it was
32:34 just again glossed over
32:35 it's weird they said a lot of the
32:39 problems we run into
32:40 is in the summertime and the summer time
32:44 creates for various obvious various
32:47 reasons that are obvious
32:48 mist and clouds and hurricanes and crazy
32:52 storms that come out of nowhere
32:54 they said it was very very common when
32:57 you're fishing just
32:58 off the coast of bermuda and i don't
32:59 mean that far away because again
33:01 right off the bat you have a 4 000 foot
33:03 drop which is nearly a mile
33:05 i mean that's just insane right if you
33:07 want to know how deep
33:09 four thousand miles or four thousand
33:10 feet is
33:13 if you think back to that time the um
33:16 the russians had that
33:17 submarine that sank
33:21 i can't remember it's like nova scotia
33:23 area or something and probably wrong but
33:25 it's sort of like that
33:26 little mezzanine between america and
33:28 europe
33:29 i think and we were offering to go and
33:32 help them
33:33 i believe that that was just about 360
33:36 feet
33:37 and it was so volatile no one could just
33:39 escape you'd get the bends and you'd die
33:41 you'd be crushed
33:42 most likely so 4000 is huge
33:45 this one seaplane has a problem during
33:49 the summer but flight 19 was december
33:51 5th
33:53 there's going to be another december 5th
33:55 flight that happens i believe in 1970
33:58 that we're going to talk about that had
34:00 a
34:01 potential time warp experience
34:04 as confirmed by their departure time and
34:07 their arrival time
34:09 they're supposed to have an hour and 20
34:10 minute flight if everything went well
34:12 with great weather and sometimes it goes
34:15 up to about an hour and a half but they
34:16 were able to get from
34:19 the bahamas to florida
34:23 in about 30 minutes 30 45 minutes and so
34:27 we'll go back to that one as well but
34:28 flight 19
34:31 is a training exercise a flight
34:34 instructor
34:36 with a name of taylor is guiding some
34:40 students
34:41 to fly to this sort of area between
34:45 puerto rico and bermuda
34:49 and then they were supposed to turn and
34:51 then fly over to bermuda
34:53 and then they dropped some fake bombs
34:55 into the
34:56 ocean and then they are supposed to fly
34:59 back to
35:00 florida well
35:04 there's been more analysis on flight 19
35:06 than i think
35:07 any other disappearance in the history
35:10 of
35:10 the bermuda triangle and again at this
35:13 time
35:14 because the the phrase was coined in 64.
35:17 and again i saw some documentary that
35:18 said it was
35:19 coined in the 50s but then they didn't
35:21 cite any sources so we're going to go
35:22 with that magazine
35:24 which literally wrote a fictional piece
35:28 about the area and embellished a bunch
35:30 of things there's a fictional magazine
35:32 it just stuck that was all what a great
35:35 bermuda trying what a great idea
35:38 so this guy goes off of the students
35:41 they make their first
35:42 waypoint they turn and go to bermuda
35:44 they do drop their bombs
35:46 and now it's time to come home and
35:49 for whatever reason the leader gets lost
35:54 and he believes that he has been flying
35:57 this is what's really strange because
36:00 this instructor had been there several
36:03 times and had done this
36:04 several times with his students and
36:07 there's all kinds of pilots that have
36:08 done these flights now this is right
36:09 after world war
36:10 ii ended so they're still practicing and
36:12 you know and
36:14 just kind of keeping sharp
36:17 but by the time he reports back to air
36:19 traffic control
36:21 he thinks he's all the sudden by the
36:23 keys
36:25 which if you don't know this area
36:26 geographically you know that there's
36:28 florida that comes down into the ocean
36:31 and the keys are on the lower right hand
36:34 side
36:34 or lower lower left hand side of the
36:36 island
36:38 so that's quite a distance from where he
36:40 last was
36:41 so for him to make that miscalculation
36:43 is kind of strange
36:44 he would have had to have been flying
36:46 for hours to get there
36:49 what they think happened was that he
36:51 mistaken
36:52 some islands off the coast of bermuda by
36:55 flying in potentially a circle of some
36:57 sort
36:58 as the keys and so he thought okay
37:00 here's what we're going to do we're just
37:01 going to go
37:02 north or even east
37:05 into florida and we'll find the airport
37:07 somewhere and we'll land
37:09 and of course that would be if he's in
37:10 bermuda that would explain why
37:13 their radio transmissions kept getting
37:15 weaker and weaker and they're running
37:16 low on fuel
37:18 and there's a lot of speculation of like
37:21 why would his students follow him
37:25 and i would say that if the conditions
37:26 were so bad that an instructor who had
37:28 been there several times is
37:30 getting lost then his students have
37:32 really no chance in hell
37:34 beating the system of potentially
37:37 spatial disorientation
37:40 now the spatial disorientation is more
37:43 fascinating than just the bermuda
37:44 triangle
37:46 and they also they call it vertigo but
37:49 it's not
37:50 really the vertigo that you and i might
37:52 experience
37:53 in the modern day times where cell phone
37:55 towers are probably
37:56 jingling your brain a little bit and
37:58 then
37:59 you suddenly have vertigo like once 4g
38:02 hit
38:04 southern california i had three friends
38:07 of mine
38:08 suddenly have massive vertigo one was a
38:11 chef
38:11 one was a designer and one was my
38:14 neighbor across the street
38:16 and then they reported their relatives
38:20 kind of catching it you know it's really
38:21 weird
38:23 but spatial disorientation is the theory
38:26 that
38:27 when you're on land walking with your
38:30 legs especially
38:31 you have all kinds of landmarks around
38:34 you that let you know where you are
38:36 whether you're up or down
38:38 now for any of you that have gone to an
38:39 amusement park where you go through a
38:41 tunnel
38:42 that's rotating you'll know what spatial
38:44 disorientation feels like
38:46 your brain is trying to grasp something
38:50 that isn't moving to give you some
38:51 orientation for those of you get car
38:53 sickness
38:54 very similar problem what do you do when
38:56 you get in a car and you get car
38:57 sickness
38:59 if you're sitting in the front seat you
39:01 don't usually get it when you're driving
39:02 because you're
39:03 staring at the road landmark landmark
39:05 landmark that you're
39:07 this way and not the other way you need
39:09 to stop reading your book you need to
39:10 stop looking at your phone and start
39:12 staring out the front window
39:15 at the highway and if you have driving
39:18 sickness then you shouldn't be in a back
39:19 seat ever
39:21 because it'd be much rather someone give
39:23 up shotgun and you not puke everywhere
39:25 but if you are in the back seat you want
39:27 to sit right in the middle of the back
39:28 seat and just
39:29 utterly you grab the two chairs in front
39:31 of you and you stare out the front
39:33 chairs giving you some stability on your
39:35 stomach and then stare straight ahead
39:37 don't let anyone take your eyes off that
39:40 at night it can be a little more
39:41 difficult
39:42 but now imagine you're in a plane built
39:44 in the 40s
39:46 you don't have a lot of modern equipment
39:48 there's going to be another anomaly with
39:50 the compass that's going to make it even
39:51 worse
39:53 so you're like hey man i've flown in bad
39:55 storms before
39:56 whatever again these planes don't go
39:59 tremendously high in the air
40:02 so typically landmarks are not not hard
40:03 to find
40:05 but when you have a mist below you and
40:07 potentially a storm on top of you
40:10 not a tremendous storm doesn't have to
40:12 be a hurricane or anything
40:14 you're staring at the window i just saw
40:16 a video
40:17 someone posted it was a daily dose
40:19 internet or whatever but it was
40:20 this is what you see when you fly in a
40:22 snowstorm
40:24 and oh my god it looks like the
40:27 millennium falcon going to light speed
40:29 you are completely and utterly
40:31 disoriented you could be upside
40:33 down and you would know it
40:36 so what happens is the mind starts to
40:39 let go
40:40 of all of its spatial acuity and you
40:44 start to
40:44 in some cases depending on your
40:46 constitution and doesn't matter how many
40:48 flying hours you have
40:50 it doesn't if you've never experienced
40:52 it before the perfect storm as they
40:54 might say
40:55 you can panic hardcore
40:59 and there's going to be a story i'm
41:00 going to tell you about these two
41:03 non-elite twins the rothschild twins
41:06 rothchild
41:07 twins were coming to visit their father
41:11 i guess they were going to be going to a
41:12 funeral i think and uh
41:15 their pilot freaked completely out but
41:17 we'll get back to that story a little
41:18 bit
41:20 so flight 19 just keeps getting
41:24 quieter and quieter on the radio several
41:27 dudes
41:28 are in this squad 13 to be exact
41:32 with uh 14 airmen
41:36 so to make matters worse right after
41:39 this thing goes
41:40 down i'm sorry it's 14 people in these
41:43 planes
41:44 uh and five avenger aircraft tbf
41:48 aircraft and then another plane goes out
41:51 to
41:52 try to find them and it had 13 people
41:55 and excuse me and it
41:57 disappears completely and someone said
42:00 they
42:01 saw an explosion in the sky and
42:04 apparently the plane that went out there
42:06 uh definitely had maintenance issues and
42:08 it was sort of an emergency thing
42:11 the avengers were not like the movie
42:14 they were planes that were on constant
42:16 call because of world war
42:18 ii so they're just always sitting there
42:20 ready so that's what that squad was all
42:21 about
42:23 so they then conduct a gigantic search
42:27 i think it was over 242 planes
42:31 searched the entire area and north and
42:34 just everywhere they last heard these
42:35 signals and could triangulate their
42:37 location
42:39 and they found nothing which just
42:44 i don't know i mean maybe avenger planes
42:45 do just sink to the bottom of the ocean
42:47 pretty quickly
42:48 you just i mean again it's a big ocean
42:50 and you're looking down it's reflective
42:52 and it's got white caps sometimes and
42:54 so even if you saw something you may not
42:56 know what you're seeing or whatever
42:58 they didn't find anybody now there was a
43:02 rumor circulated about 1998ish
43:06 that the taylor guy managed to get
43:09 rescued that he did crash
43:10 he managed to get rescued and then he
43:12 married some island girls on one of the
43:13 islands somewhere
43:16 and that he was so
43:19 worried about getting court-martialed
43:21 because all of his other
43:23 students died that he just kind of kept
43:25 quiet
43:26 but that was never proven in fact the
43:29 gentleman that were of his age
43:31 in the air force because every december
43:33 5th there's a ceremony
43:35 in florida for flight 19 at least there
43:38 was up until 2000
43:41 they're always scouting the place for
43:42 someone of that age
43:44 who looks like taylor who might have
43:45 might just visit the
43:47 memorial if the guy was smart he would
43:50 never do such a thing
43:52 so flight 19 feels pretty non
43:57 uh mysterious except for
44:00 except we know that he ran into a
44:02 compass issue his instruments were all
44:04 crazy
44:05 he was calling to his other students
44:06 saying are any of your compasses working
44:09 so i could figure out where the hell
44:10 they were and they were all having
44:12 issues
44:13 now let's just say the theory about
44:18 how the earth's interior made of
44:21 electricity
44:22 plasma electricity and you you see this
44:25 all the time with volcanoes that erupt
44:27 burp lightning bolts it's probably one
44:30 of the only times you'll see lightning
44:31 bolts come out of the ground
44:33 when lightning bolts come down from
44:34 storms they always ground themselves to
44:36 the earth because it's where the core is
44:38 right
44:40 now for any of you study pre-dynastic
44:43 pre-inca construction
44:44 from my other episodes you'll know that
44:47 there's a
44:48 there's a rock species in south america
44:50 that when you
44:51 go up to it and it's in the mountain you
44:52 can put a compass on it nothing happens
44:54 but if you cut it out and turn it into
44:56 an h
44:57 it all of a sudden makes the compass fly
45:00 it's very strange
45:02 might be how they might have built
45:03 highways out of these h rocks and then
45:05 just push rocks
45:07 on top of them to get them from one
45:08 place to another and then you could
45:10 cannibalize your road
45:11 from the back and put it to the front so
45:13 you wouldn't have to have an infinite
45:14 amount
45:15 these rocks aren't completely light but
45:17 they're definitely light enough
45:18 and small enough that man could move
45:20 them
45:22 so you have this real volatile area
45:25 in the earth's crust hence the methane
45:28 bursts that come out of the bottom of
45:29 the earth
45:30 well imagine during these bursts or even
45:33 without the methane coming out
45:36 the crust lets go of some torrent
45:39 of electricity invisible to the human
45:42 eye
45:43 but up through the bottom of the earth
45:46 and therefore you get some anomaly in
45:49 anything that's going to rely on
45:52 a magnetic pole
45:55 as well think about all the hurricanes
45:57 that happen in that area and how they
45:59 seem to gain
45:59 energy in that area well
46:03 ether moves just like water now water's
46:06 a different thing in terms of
46:08 its mass and how it displaces things so
46:10 when i say that
46:12 ethereal pressures are gravity it's not
46:15 the same thing
46:16 exactly as the way air and water work
46:19 with pressure
46:20 in that realm imagine the whole thing
46:23 can't be discovered because we can't
46:24 allow out
46:26 they can't allow out the theory of
46:29 ether but that would account for
46:32 compasses going nuts and boats
46:34 encompasses going nuts
46:36 in planes it could also account for the
46:38 fact that
46:39 even though you do have a very warm
46:42 sector of the world there
46:44 you do get these warm and cold fronts
46:47 pounding into each other
46:48 but they do seem to augment and boost in
46:50 this area
46:53 so i think that just as a layman
46:56 meteorologist
46:57 you could say i mean we've all said it
47:00 to ourselves we're looking at a
47:02 hurricane
47:02 prediction we're looking at the aerial
47:04 photographs of it and you're just going
47:06 geez what
47:07 must it be like to be in the ocean right
47:09 there well
47:11 that's a gigantic hurricane that's as
47:13 big as a state
47:14 but what about a bunch of little ones
47:15 that just need to clobber a boat
47:17 or disorient a pilot or even knock a
47:20 pilot out of the sky
47:21 because back in the day these planes
47:24 didn't go high enough to fly over
47:26 a lot of these clouds
47:30 so in comes the bruce guernin
47:33 experience i don't know how to spell his
47:35 last name
47:37 1970 december 4th the day before
47:41 flight 19 had an issue way back in 1945
47:44 how interestingly coincidental
47:46 now i'm going to pre-qualify this by
47:48 saying the following
47:50 i just recently watched his testimony um
47:53 this is a father son i don't know if the
47:56 father was still alive when this was
47:57 taken i think the father's definitely
47:58 got to be passed at this point
48:00 now the son that recalled the story
48:03 he kind of changed the story a little
48:05 bit from the first version of it that i
48:06 heard
48:08 and he was blinking like one of these
48:11 guys who does
48:12 ufo testimonies where it kind of falls
48:14 apart
48:15 so i i don't know
48:18 just seems strange but it did seem like
48:20 he was citing
48:22 his flight log both the bahama departure
48:25 time with flight control
48:26 and the miami flight control when he
48:29 arrives
48:30 but he takes off with his dad and starts
48:33 flying
48:34 towards miami it's going to be a
48:35 90-minute flight on average
48:37 and it was good day it was a good day
48:40 he says suddenly though in the middle of
48:42 this wonderful weather which is not
48:44 uncommon for this area
48:46 a giant leticulous cloud came up and he
48:49 said it was
48:51 probably capped at about 60 thousand
48:53 feet
48:54 so he couldn't fly around it
48:57 easily if he did he'd be flying for a
49:00 long time
49:00 and of course there's fuel issues and
49:02 all that kind of stuff and this guy had
49:04 you know
49:04 quite a bit of experience flying these
49:06 some of these two destinations
49:09 because he's a property developer he
49:12 said that the cloud started to
49:13 change shape right in front of him and
49:15 started to sink in the middle
49:17 creating kind of a u-shape as they and
49:19 it's right where they're flying
49:21 which he thought was really weird he
49:23 said as they
49:24 flew into this horseshoe sort of like
49:27 what moses partnered to see except the
49:29 base is still up in the sky
49:32 said that the cloud then encircled them
49:35 and started creating a tunnel he said
49:38 that the light flickering inside the
49:39 clouds was
49:40 extremely rapid and strange because he'd
49:43 flown several times past storms and
49:45 through storms and he said usually it's
49:47 more
49:47 you know pal there wait a little while
49:49 boom boom but he said this was just like
49:51 strobing he said then a tunnel
49:55 started to form inside this little
49:57 pocket that was going counter clockwise
50:00 the first version of the story was that
50:02 these guys were stuck in there for a
50:04 really long time and no matter what they
50:05 did they couldn't get out of it
50:07 the version i heard him tell the story
50:10 with his own
50:11 words being filmed or he's blinking like
50:14 crazy
50:15 he didn't it wasn't as dramatized
50:19 so that's good don't know where the
50:22 other story came from
50:24 but he's trying to punch through this
50:26 hole at the end because he can still see
50:28 sky on the other side of this hole and
50:30 so they're trying to punch through it
50:32 and what we don't know is how many
50:36 minutes into the flight
50:38 uh he was uh had already taken place
50:41 when he hits this u-shaped thing that
50:42 surrounds his plane
50:44 but by the time he punches out of this
50:46 thing he said that
50:48 immediately the radio goes nuts from air
50:51 traffic control going
50:52 oh my god i got a plane in my in my zone
50:55 and they said the air traffic control
50:57 told him that we couldn't see you
51:01 once you entered this cloud we could not
51:03 see you anymore on radar
51:06 now i don't think that's a giant stretch
51:07 because everything's
51:09 electrical and radar and so it could be
51:12 the cloud was just providing
51:13 so much electrical activity that you
51:15 know just bounces off the cloud or goes
51:17 in and gets all messed up like a stealth
51:19 aircraft or something
51:21 but he says that the
51:25 flight time again between the bahamas
51:27 and miami
51:30 was about 45 minutes so for him
51:33 he believes he got into some sort of
51:35 time warp
51:38 all right there isn't
51:41 uh you know outside of like
51:44 mathematical theories on paper there's
51:46 not really any
51:48 substantive example of time warps
51:51 occurring
51:52 that would account for such a thing
51:54 you're like we can't say oh what
51:55 happened over there and then
51:56 there's this thing over here now i did
51:59 read a funny
52:00 funny story about a plane that departed
52:04 from the new york area and it was
52:07 supposed to be flying to
52:08 [Music]
52:10 one of the caribbean islands of some so
52:13 i can't remember which one it was
52:15 and it takes off and
52:19 it disappears and they never found it
52:22 and then supposedly in the
52:24 1990 the ship disappeared
52:28 somewhere in the 60s or something and
52:30 there was a tall tale that
52:32 an air traffic control guy with a name
52:34 that nobody recognizes as an employee
52:37 suddenly sees the plane and it lands
52:41 and when they start trying to reconcile
52:43 who are you where are you from
52:45 and somebody was trying to figure out
52:48 the date and then they told him
52:50 before they exited the plane to open the
52:52 plane up that it was 1990 the dude
52:54 freaks out the pilot
52:56 and then rethrottles up and takes off as
52:58 all the emergency vehicles are rushing
52:59 to the to the plane
53:01 apparently there was a fictional article
53:05 written somewhere in the early 80s that
53:07 was exactly that story and it got
53:09 resurrected and retold
53:10 and everybody in local areas like amen
53:13 we would love for that to be true but
53:15 no one knows about this happening so all
53:17 those emergency vehicle people
53:19 were like what are you talking about we
53:20 never did this it's a twilight zone
53:22 episode
53:23 it's a couple twilight zone episodes
53:24 mixed together to be honest
53:27 now if we were to really stretch things
53:29 okay
53:31 which may or may not be a stretch but
53:34 there's a couple ways we could
53:35 maybe incubate up uh some sort of time
53:38 anomaly
53:40 the more difficult one to wrap your mind
53:43 around would be
53:45 if the earth is ejecting a tremendous
53:48 amount of electrical energy
53:50 then anomalies can occur in electricity
53:52 that we haven't observed anywhere else
53:55 at least above ground anyone's willing
53:56 to admit which might
54:00 account for this cloud you know there's
54:03 the joke where you see
54:05 big sort of mother ship clouds
54:09 maybe those are meticulous sites to
54:10 figure it out and ever you know you just
54:12 drive by them in the desert sometimes oh
54:14 there's the ufo you know
54:17 so it could be that just a natural
54:19 phenomenon occurs
54:21 where somehow there's a little mini
54:23 einstein rosenbridge a little jump
54:25 which is all rose and stuff probably
54:28 it's interesting
54:30 i think what's actually easier to
54:31 believe if you're a ufologist
54:34 ufologist is that right
54:37 is that what if these vehicles are
54:40 coming in and out of
54:42 earth's i guess realm of existence
54:46 and they are using technology that warps
54:50 space-time
54:52 and so you're merely getting close to
54:55 them
54:56 and you're jumping on the back of their
54:59 technology
55:00 i mean imagine this big cloud has a ship
55:02 in it it's
55:04 big but it's not as big as the cloud
55:05 because that's why they encapsulate
55:07 themselves in it
55:08 and you simply drift on top of their
55:10 gravity wave or whatever it is
55:12 and you're able to do a little hopscotch
55:14 technique
55:17 because they didn't see you you don't
55:18 have to do anything about it
55:21 for the vehicles that may have
55:24 disappeared
55:25 due to ufos
55:28 it could be one of two things because so
55:30 many vehicles are never found
55:33 for instance the bahamas has a very
55:36 shallow
55:37 i think a 50-foot average
55:41 maximum depth around the islands and
55:44 tons of boats and tons of planes have
55:46 disappeared
55:47 not just boats but let's kind of make me
55:49 think about kidnappers and human
55:51 traffickers
55:53 but a bunch of stuff's disappeared in
55:55 the bahamas as well and no one's found
55:56 anything
55:57 ever and so it's not that deep not to
56:00 find
56:00 some wreckage of some sort
56:04 but now imagine that you are
56:08 not probably flight 19 it seems to have
56:10 meticulously
56:11 dramatized through real life getting
56:14 lost
56:14 in the ocean there wasn't like ah they
56:17 went out five minutes and they
56:18 disappeared it was
56:19 clear as day you know uh you know
56:22 if you had a situation where like i look
56:24 out on my left window and i saw flight
56:26 19
56:27 and then i looked straight ahead and i
56:28 looked left and he's gone and it's broad
56:30 daylight and there's no storm well then
56:31 you got like a
56:32 wild ass story but if this were some
56:36 proxy zone
56:37 or they're coming in and out of the
56:38 ocean if you believe that right
56:41 then you have potentially
56:44 oh they saw us they better come with us
56:47 situation
56:48 which is where you might have the
56:50 situations where boats are found but the
56:52 crew is gone
56:54 now the other big one is that pirates do
56:57 exist
56:58 in the modern day times and they will
57:00 hop on ships and
57:02 and uh you know force people on radios
57:06 to make
57:06 normal communications even though
57:08 they're kidnapped because they got a gun
57:10 to their head and they want to live
57:11 they're like i don't give a crap about
57:12 anything on this
57:13 boat and so that stuff happens too there
57:17 was a
57:18 famous boat that kept showing up
57:21 and showing up and showing up and it
57:22 would show up without anyone on it
57:25 and people would pass the boat and they
57:26 i forgot the name of it but they'd look
57:28 over and like what the hell
57:29 that was that boat i don't see anyone on
57:30 the deck they'd radio over to it no one
57:33 say anything
57:35 and it didn't seem to have any cargo on
57:37 it and then sometimes they later on
57:38 they'd find it with a crew on it but it
57:40 looked like a little renegade crew
57:42 and then when someone said they were
57:44 going to go get the boat
57:47 all of a sudden they boat vanishes and i
57:50 think one of them ended up
57:52 off the coast of ireland or something
57:54 and it was empty
57:56 derelict completely ready to be torn
57:58 down so that happens as well so keep
58:01 that in the back your mind
58:03 but now there's another anomaly where
58:06 you will hear
58:07 and i remember this when i was a kid the
58:09 city underneath
58:11 the center of the bermuda area
58:15 slightly closer to florida and
58:19 here's the thing i've told you guys a
58:23 long time ago about the dude who did
58:24 like the
58:25 god it must have been a three hour
58:27 special on flat earth and he
58:28 him proving that he had tracked new
58:31 plates in the pacific
58:32 coming out of the crack down the pacific
58:34 and he says there's one in atlantic but
58:35 the atlantic
58:36 crust is slightly stronger pacific is
58:39 weaker
58:39 so the pacific ocean floor grew way
58:42 faster which is why it goes down from
58:43 the continents right continents are on
58:44 top
58:45 all pushed together no pangaea drift
58:47 everything connects all the way around
58:49 and as the
58:50 earth rips apart it starts sinking and
58:53 sinking because it's all brand new
58:55 and there's no mass anymore to fill it
58:57 up
58:59 and one of the big key signs that this
59:01 was definitely a case
59:03 was that in his theory he said that
59:06 quite and again get out google earth if
59:08 you've never seen this before it will
59:10 change your whole perspective on
59:11 everything
59:13 especially you flat earthers take a look
59:14 at it because you got to account for
59:17 this
59:18 he said that he was pretty conclusive
59:20 that
59:21 the way that the earth ripped apart
59:24 there was
59:24 a quarantined barrier at the indonesian
59:27 islands
59:28 when they were all connected together
59:30 that the pacifi
59:31 pacific ocean was a mile lower up to a
59:35 mile lower
59:36 than the atlantic ocean now this dude's
59:39 wrong
59:40 it might have been even higher who knows
59:42 but right around the indonesian islands
59:43 if you look on the bottom of the ocean
59:45 you see the huge sludge mark where he
59:47 believes
59:48 that it gave way and then rushed down
59:50 the bottom of the ocean i mean it's
59:51 it's undeniable if you just look at it
59:53 in my opinion
59:55 remember deep thoughts can't observe
59:56 reality and just say
59:58 it's right there then we're screwed
60:02 we can't let previous commitments to
60:04 other paradigms
60:05 impact our ability to get to the truth
60:08 easter island easter island was
60:10 discovered by the dutch in the early
60:12 1700s
60:13 and all those little heads were all
60:15 everywhere little
60:16 i mean size of a house right
60:20 but when they look for the stone that
60:22 those heads are made out of it's not
60:24 indigenous to the actual island itself
60:26 the closest distance today
60:29 if you stay above the ocean surface
60:32 is 12 000 miles away in asia
60:37 but if you drain the ocean down several
60:40 hundred feet it's right off the coast
60:44 for any of you follow graham hancock and
60:46 you you study his he and his wife doing
60:48 dives off the coast of japan
60:50 where they found like temples and all
60:52 kinds of stuff they keep trying to tell
60:53 you
60:53 it's a natural formation pacific was
60:57 lower
60:57 people used to live down there they
60:59 rushed up into the hills once this
61:01 catastrophe occurs could be the reason
61:04 why they have a myth
61:06 or a story i should say about a great
61:08 flood
61:10 i grew up in kansas lots of seashells in
61:13 kansas
61:15 and but no like big giant shark
61:17 carcasses or anything like that
61:19 and so we think that those guys very
61:22 logically suggested that when you have a
61:24 mile of water
61:25 with you know i don't even know how many
61:28 trillions of tons of water
61:30 coming towards the coasts of everything
61:32 in the americas
61:33 you will get the malibu islands or
61:36 malibs
61:36 malibu hills out of this crashing wave
61:40 that could be by the time it hits the
61:42 coast
61:43 half a mile high i mean just imagine
61:46 viewing that yeah and so it splashes
61:49 water all the way into the americas
61:52 and then i get in kansas several million
61:54 years later
61:55 a bunch of seashells in my backyard that
61:58 makes no sense
62:00 the other one is that there was a piece
62:02 of research that i read about
62:05 a bunch of german scientists who did
62:08 reverse engineering on the age of the
62:10 ocean by reversing the salt content in
62:12 the ocean
62:13 knowing how much it exponentially grows
62:15 and then reversing the algorithm
62:17 and the conclusion of their article was
62:19 that it they said the oceans can't be
62:21 any more than 60 million years old
62:24 you roll it back and everything's gone
62:27 okay
62:27 well that is definitely a huge distance
62:31 back for mankind but i just looked up a
62:33 website today which had a
62:35 picture of a hammer that had been
62:38 encapsulated in stone
62:40 and when they carbonate the stone and i
62:42 know there's a big
62:44 question about that technology's
62:45 accuracy
62:47 but this was in case in stone it was a
62:50 wooden handle that goes up through
62:54 a stone beveled hammer top
62:58 and it was dated approximately 140
63:01 million years ago
63:02 so again those who control the world
63:04 want you to believe that we just got
63:06 here
63:06 especially because of the sort of the
63:09 jesuit christian
63:10 pressure of saying the old testament is
63:12 the beginning of time
63:14 adam and eve was just 4 500 i guess
63:17 years ago nothing can be older than that
63:20 the other one is the big ice age
63:22 argument which again i'm not a huge fan
63:24 of
63:25 this sort of
63:29 it's it's sort of like the the laziest
63:32 anthropological conclusion to any story
63:36 you'll be like studying something really
63:37 brilliant and they go well then of
63:39 course the ice age happened
63:41 of course you weren't there and you're
63:42 full of crap that icebergs got down to
63:45 egypt
63:45 the only way icebergs get down to egypt
63:48 is to
63:49 rotate the poles of the earth which very
63:51 well may have happened because of maps
63:53 transposed in what 1392
63:57 that have the antarctica island
64:00 continent or whatever completely mapped
64:02 out without any snow on it
64:05 hmm interesting could be a psyop who
64:07 knows
64:09 now the other story about the
64:12 the guy that his father flying through
64:14 that meticulous cloud
64:17 was that one of his versions of the
64:19 story was he said that the plane seemed
64:21 like it was flying itself
64:24 that's fascinating but he didn't say
64:25 that in the interview that i saw where
64:27 it was actually him talking
64:29 if you're a ufologist with the bermuda
64:32 triangle what's interesting about it is
64:34 wouldn't that be the way to get these
64:36 people out of your hair
64:38 you know you're in a ufo you're like
64:39 okay yeah let's make sure they get the
64:41 hell away from us
64:42 it'll be an amazing little story for
64:44 them they're going to lose some time
64:46 um or at least transpose space and time
64:50 interesting now for the rothschild
64:53 brothers
64:55 this supposedly and i i didn't get the
64:57 year down unfortunately
64:58 they said it happened before flight 19
65:02 but it's these two identical twin
65:03 brothers that were
65:05 again i think they were i think they
65:08 were in the navy
65:09 and they were just taking a plane from
65:11 point a to point b to go to this funeral
65:14 and they said that the pilot just
65:17 utterly panics he gets
65:18 absolute spatial disorientation he was
65:21 yelling at them in the back seat going i
65:23 want you guys to both look out
65:24 you know starboard and poor windows and
65:26 let me know if you see anything on the
65:28 ground
65:28 anything because i don't know where the
65:30 hell we are eventually he stated
65:33 that he was too terrified to fly the
65:35 plane and the co-pilot had to take over
65:37 and fly the plane and they managed to
65:38 land safely and apparently one of the
65:40 brothers didn't fly for 20 years he was
65:42 so freaked out about flying
65:44 and i'd have to say that would
65:47 definitely get me on the edge too
65:50 but now the brothers also reported the
65:53 the instrument
65:54 problem so i think that
65:57 we can conclusively say that something
66:00 is most likely emitting from the earth
66:06 at this particular region and
66:09 spiraling up into the sky confusing all
66:12 instruments on
66:12 boats and all instruments in the sky
66:16 now one of the other potential ways that
66:20 they think that some of these things
66:21 happen is that there's some
66:23 wild round like sinkholes all up and
66:26 down the
66:27 area between bermuda and
66:31 the bahamas in fact only a handful of
66:34 them have ever been investigated
66:36 if you see them on a map it's wild
66:38 you'll have like that crystal clear blue
66:39 water and then all sudden poof it's a
66:42 just a bottomless pit like really freaky
66:45 and so they said that if
66:49 they said certain holes and depending on
66:51 the the velocity of the ship
66:54 and the currents and all that kind of
66:56 stuff you could actually
66:58 be buoyant uh with a certain surface
67:01 underneath you
67:02 and then as you hit one of these holes
67:04 your front end could tip down inside the
67:06 hole especially if you got one of these
67:08 rogue waves on you
67:09 and then poof you're gonna be underwater
67:12 before you know it
67:13 now what would seem logical is that they
67:15 could at least lower instruments down
67:17 into these holes
67:18 and find out if anything's down there or
67:20 put one of those deep sea submarines
67:22 down there and see if something's down
67:23 there
67:25 now it was stated very clearly by
67:27 specialists who do
67:28 search for treasure and ships
67:32 that everywhere in the bottom of the
67:33 ocean everywhere
67:36 there are shipwrecks all over the place
67:38 there just are
67:40 not as many planes so that might be
67:45 a sign of something or it could be that
67:47 the planes simply disintegrate so much
67:49 that by the time they get to the bottom
67:51 and you get coral all over them and
67:53 sedimentary rock all over them you just
67:55 don't find them as easily as a ship
67:56 that's going to be a much bigger
67:58 object and again i didn't read anything
68:01 about commercial air flights having
68:03 a huge issue down in that area but what
68:07 came
68:07 clearly out of the indigenous fishermen
68:10 of the area
68:12 was they said that you know a lot of
68:14 people go down there to either retire
68:16 and take up fishing or they're just some
68:19 kind of nomadic kid who's going to do
68:21 a few years down there and go back to
68:23 wherever they live
68:25 they said that one of the biggest
68:27 reasons why
68:28 tourists like there's there's boats
68:30 where a honeymooning couple
68:33 rents a boat to go out and they just
68:34 disappear and they're never found again
68:38 was they said that just without any
68:40 major
68:41 reasons without water funnels or water
68:44 spouts or
68:45 major storms like hurricanes with names
68:49 and things
68:50 they said that once you get over
68:53 a deeper ocean let's say they said
68:57 actually
68:57 there's two things once you get over the
68:59 deeper ocean you get into much more
69:00 violent waters
69:02 they said that even like one of the
69:04 fishermen was saying that look
69:06 it might not sound intense because when
69:09 you start fishing you start going out
69:11 towards the
69:11 the especially in bermuda island where
69:13 you've got this 4000 foot drop
69:15 but go right out to the edge and kind of
69:17 stop the boat
69:19 and then they fish over that edge
69:21 because they said
69:23 you'll you'll start off and you'll have
69:25 like two or three foot waves if it's
69:26 kind of rough
69:27 which if you've ever been on a boat a
69:29 two or three foot wake
69:30 off someone else's boat even at a lake
69:32 can make you sick and make you
69:33 disoriented and
69:34 definitely makes the ride really rough
69:36 depending how fast you're going
69:38 i remember i've been at havasu in
69:40 monsoons
69:41 and it can get incredibly violent with
69:44 just a
69:44 rainstorm it's nuts but they said these
69:47 two and three foot waves will suddenly
69:49 turn into
69:50 six and eight foot waves and he goes if
69:51 you don't have a big ship
69:53 you can go under really really fast
69:56 because again
69:57 the boat will rear up tipping the front
70:00 end and then when you duck dive
70:01 into the face of a wave you can just
70:04 keep going down
70:06 and one of my old bosses was a big
70:08 deep-sea diver
70:09 and i asked him one time i said
70:13 there was this there's this terminal
70:16 depth
70:16 that your body goes down into the ocean
70:19 or in water in general
70:20 where if you go past this amount of
70:24 feet in the ocean the amount of weight
70:26 over your head
70:27 is so heavy that you'll start going
70:29 faster and faster towards the bottom of
70:31 the ocean
70:32 that's like scary as hell right okay
70:36 so he said i asked him listen he goes
70:38 it's about 35 to 40 feet
70:40 you start getting so much weight over
70:41 your head you got a problem
70:44 so you never know you got a big rogue
70:47 wave on you
70:48 and then within seconds you're 100 feet
70:50 in the under under the
70:52 ocean and you're attached to a boat and
70:55 maybe you get a chance to swim up but if
70:57 you swim up and it's a big storm up
70:59 there and you're way away from the coast
71:02 and you can't see any land and you don't
71:04 have your compass on you
71:06 if it even worked you're pretty much
71:08 screwed
71:09 i mean it's just a these tragedies at
71:11 sea or
71:12 something else you know the ocean's a
71:13 very formidable thing and and
71:16 i think that once you see a few tsunami
71:18 videos you start to understand the
71:20 utter power of water and what's crazy is
71:23 when you see those
71:25 tsunami videos from fukushima slash
71:28 japan
71:30 you start to realize
71:33 that this water doesn't have to make
71:35 even a peep
71:37 for it to take out cities within minutes
71:41 cities that have been there thousands of
71:42 years you know
71:44 now in terms of let's go back to ufos to
71:46 finish this thing off
71:48 the big question i have about the ufo
71:51 situation
71:52 with these sort of deep-sea base
71:55 concepts especially bill cooper's story
71:58 is the choice
72:02 of a ufo to to fatally injure
72:06 a human being it would seem as if
72:09 if we just take all the sightings we've
72:11 ever heard about and all the stories
72:12 we've ever heard about
72:13 the only time that i've ever heard a
72:14 consistency
72:18 about vehicles that are unidentified in
72:20 the sky
72:22 harming human beings would be
72:26 what i would probably chalk up to
72:29 military vehicles that are using very
72:32 proprietary strange experimental
72:35 fuel systems like in the triangle view
72:38 triangle sightings
72:40 the aurora project sort of stuff where
72:42 people look up at the
72:44 vehicle and they get burned with
72:46 radiation they typically some of them
72:47 even died of radiation poisoning
72:50 but the straight up you know saucer ufos
72:53 or cigar shaped ufos
72:55 or the ones that the pilots are chasing
72:59 i've never heard of those hurting any
73:01 human beings
73:02 bill cooper says he sees two leave and
73:04 two enter
73:06 right next to his ship so if they're
73:08 terribly concerned about us seeing them
73:11 then i think we would have much more
73:13 information about
73:15 hostile interactions with these vehicles
73:19 now the interesting thing about being on
73:21 the bottom of the ocean as a
73:23 as a observer of earth whether they
73:26 contributed to its creation
73:27 or its population or whatever it doesn't
73:30 have to have any of those things to be
73:32 amazingly
73:33 mysterious to observe right as a
73:35 scientist
73:36 from another world is that if they were
73:39 closer to a really volatile area of the
73:41 earth's crust
73:43 then because of its plasma core they
73:46 could extrapolate from the core
73:48 infinite power to do whatever they want
73:50 maybe not that they need it but
73:52 you know you put a power source inside
73:54 your vehicle
73:55 and then that makes the vehicle run but
73:57 when you're on the bottom of the ocean
73:59 wouldn't it be nice
74:00 to have a power source that's part of
74:01 the planet you go to we would do it
74:04 but if we show up to like the planet io
74:06 and we just have geothermal everywhere
74:08 and there's volcanoes everywhere and so
74:11 we just tap in and then we have infinite
74:13 power to do what any research that we
74:14 want
74:15 including force fields to protect us
74:17 from the
74:19 elements it would support manufacturing
74:22 it would support
74:23 scientific equipment and
74:26 one thing that uh i don't think has ever
74:29 been theorized we'll just throw it out
74:30 there
74:31 is that there's this talk since i was a
74:34 little kid
74:35 about how the electromagnetic poles
74:37 inside the bowels of the earth
74:40 shift wobble and this has been proven
74:44 i believe and if the old map serve any
74:48 indication of the earth's
74:51 history then it could be that
74:54 these things do shift at some point and
74:57 again
74:58 we're on a 23 degree tilt
75:01 from what should probably be a straight
75:04 up and down
75:05 rotation depending on how the solar
75:08 system did its thing
75:10 there are summer solstice and winter
75:13 solstice
75:15 structures in south america that are 23
75:18 degrees off
75:20 which i think is phenomenal and that's
75:22 by that uh brian forrester
75:24 guy and he was right there when he
75:28 showed it to you on the video you'll
75:30 have to get into that guy's channel to
75:32 see that
75:33 so it seemed like the world did shift at
75:35 one point
75:37 and that's probably the most terrifying
75:41 natural catastrophe that could occur for
75:43 man
75:44 to have where i'm sitting right now
75:46 which is uh
75:47 more for at least america only florida
75:51 is warmer than us
75:52 where we are and so imagine it's
75:54 shifting and
75:56 the polar ice caps are suddenly where
75:58 i'm sitting and now i gotta move to uh
76:01 who knows the antarctica to get warm
76:05 so i'm not personally convinced that
76:07 ufos would harm
76:08 man but if and
76:11 and i would say that i wouldn't imagine
76:13 them to be building any sort of
76:15 structure that would
76:19 uh randomly affects such a wide area
76:23 where everyone's having these instrument
76:25 problems the instrument problem thing is
76:28 utterly fascinating and
76:30 what's fascinating about it to me is
76:31 that one
76:33 obviously more ships and more aircraft
76:35 fly over that than wreck
76:37 obviously but there is some weird
76:41 condition
76:41 where maybe due to electrical storms
76:44 which
76:45 seems a little odd because we fly
76:48 we fly vehicles directly into hurricanes
76:50 to find out how powerful they are
76:52 and we don't use you know mechanical
76:55 devices that rely on
76:57 what they call it um magnetic poles
77:00 100 we've got other equipment satellites
77:03 and other communication
77:04 with like an aywax plane to make sure
77:06 that it always knows where it is
77:09 but you would think the military would
77:11 be the first people to
77:13 lock it down we're in the navy
77:16 we can't be surprised at any point in
77:19 time we're the air force we can't be
77:20 surprised
77:22 when doing maneuvers regardless if we
77:24 have equipment that can
77:26 override these natural phenomena we need
77:28 to know because what if something
77:30 else is affecting things what if you got
77:31 emp'd
77:33 flying in the air and your raptor just
77:35 falls out of the sky
77:36 you know you don't want anything like
77:37 that a bomber or something you know
77:40 now luckily bombers fly really really
77:42 high
77:44 60 000 feet man that's that's up there
77:46 that's the old u2
77:48 altitude right i don't think a bomber
77:51 typically maintains that type of
77:53 altitude maybe it does maybe it doesn't
77:54 there's all these theoretical planes
77:56 they're talking about
77:58 i think it was the b1 that actually
78:00 talked about
78:02 using an ionized wave to keep going in
78:05 the atmosphere at high altitudes
78:08 so there's some interesting technology
78:10 out there
78:12 as far as the old ships going down
78:15 for me a lot of that seems like very
78:19 frail ships for the time going into one
78:22 of the most volatile weather regions
78:25 this world has i'm not aware of other
78:28 than maybe off the coast of mexico
78:30 south of me any real
78:34 constant hurricane region i have an app
78:37 on my phone that
78:38 not only telling me the weather but it
78:40 has a hurricane you know indicator and
78:42 you'll see those little spiral
78:43 icons and it shows you where a projected
78:46 path goes and i've been looking at that
78:47 thing for 10 years
78:48 and really it's just right in that
78:51 region that is 95
78:53 of all the hurricanes that exist
78:56 and what i don't understand if the
78:57 documentary i saw
78:59 was correct about the navy slash
79:01 military not having bahamas
79:04 and bermuda in that area puerto rico all
79:07 the way over to america not being listed
79:08 as one of the biggest threats
79:11 for vehicles i find that kind of hard to
79:14 believe
79:14 simply because of all the hurricanes but
79:17 i'm not familiar with how they
79:18 categorize that stuff so it might just
79:20 be that they say okay we're not talking
79:22 about hurricanes
79:23 when there is a hurricane we take
79:26 precautions and we don't fly in those
79:27 regions
79:29 but what we're really talking about is
79:30 when there's not a hurricane and there's
79:32 an anomaly that's taking ships out of
79:34 the sky
79:34 and sucking them down to the bottom of
79:36 the ocean if they're boats
79:38 this region of the world and all those
79:40 stories i think fascinates the hell out
79:42 of us because it's sort of a frontier of
79:44 the unknown
79:46 if we start to accept the unexplained
79:50 i think we owe it to ourselves to
79:53 for the professionals that can study
79:55 these kind of things because they're in
79:56 the region and they have the equipment
79:57 they have the scientific background
79:59 it's definitely something that needs to
80:01 be continually researched until we can
80:04 [Music]
80:05 put a boat i mean what if they just took
80:08 a boat and they remote controlled it and
80:11 they had tons of
80:12 video equipment on it and extra gps
80:16 reporting mechanisms that perhaps report
80:18 to satellites or whatever
80:21 and just one every month or a week or
80:24 whatever you just send this
80:26 fairly good-sized boat from one point to
80:28 the other
80:29 let everybody else know here comes this
80:31 boat it's all red or something or orange
80:33 so you know it's one of those drone
80:35 boats
80:36 and see if you can't make it happen even
80:39 go out to regions where you know boats
80:41 had
80:42 had had problems at a particular time of
80:44 year you know december
80:46 5th is a pretty scary little time to be
80:48 a plane
80:49 flying in that area but one of the
80:53 i should say the number one cause
80:57 recorded in the official journals of
80:59 most of these accidents
81:01 is human error as one of the documentary
81:05 filmmakers said he goes
81:07 he goes i know that's a bit of a letdown
81:09 to hear that this is all just human
81:11 beings having problems with
81:13 spatial disorientation and you know
81:17 okay so let's say you have 3 000 boats
81:20 150 planes
81:21 and human error accounts for let's say
81:24 90
81:26 that leaves a lot left that's 300 boats
81:29 and 15 planes
81:31 that are going to be left in the
81:32 equation that don't have any explanation
81:35 flight 19 would disappear probably due
81:37 to human error
81:40 as romantic as it might have been and
81:42 again if you haven't seen close
81:43 encounters
81:44 as a movie in general you're you're in
81:47 for a good
81:48 good ride there it's pretty timeless to
81:50 be honest
81:53 there's some bell bottoms in it but
81:55 other than that it's it's just
81:56 so well made so well made i think
82:00 mysteries in general
82:02 are so elusive which is why when i write
82:04 a film i try to put a mystery in there
82:08 because it just has a natural pavlonian
82:11 reaction to
82:12 mysteries or fear and mysteries
82:16 are also inquisitive isn't it
82:18 interesting how probably every one of
82:20 you have heard about some
82:22 cataclysmic mystery where you're talking
82:24 about
82:26 you know at some point this volcano does
82:28 a certain thing or this
82:30 you know bermuda triangle is a certain
82:31 thing or whatever it might be it's
82:33 it's something formidable that can kill
82:35 you
82:36 and it could even be like um
82:40 a ufo um who's angry at you or something
82:44 and you might say to yourself well gosh
82:47 i would
82:49 sacrifice my life to die
82:52 but but also just before i die minutes
82:55 seconds before i die i get to see
82:57 the mystery unraveled you know now for
83:00 me personally the bermuda
83:02 thing unless i'm going to get scooped up
83:03 by ufo very safely i would not want to
83:06 experience anything i've heard on
83:07 these documentaries but
83:10 you know the the whole thing of a i've
83:13 said in episodes a long time ago my many
83:15 ufo episodes
83:19 if a ufo landed and said look um
83:22 would you like to come with us now you
83:25 don't know
83:26 if they know that you need to eat three
83:28 times a day and you need to take a leak
83:29 you need to take a dump
83:31 you got to sleep you can't be in
83:34 zero kelvin environments you can't be in
83:37 you know volcanic environments are
83:39 really hot you don't know
83:41 if they know anything about what you
83:43 need to get you from point a to point b
83:46 and even if they say oh yeah totally we
83:49 got you all taken care of
83:50 well there's two different ways to to
83:52 run that scenario you say no and find
83:54 out if they grab you
83:55 or you say yes and you get in there and
83:57 suddenly you find out as the ship takes
83:59 off
84:00 you're an ice cube in two seconds or
84:02 you're atomized for some reason
84:05 what i think is healthy about these
84:06 conversations
84:08 is one to definitely get to a point
84:11 where maybe you dismiss some of the
84:13 mythos
84:14 that's around our world because it tends
84:17 to make you susceptible to other forms
84:19 of belief that are potentially dangerous
84:21 to your person
84:22 you know it's one thing to say that you
84:25 believe in a spiritual
84:28 deity some sort of god of some sort
84:31 and then it's all fun and games until
84:34 you start hearing
84:35 voices that say kill this person do this
84:38 do that and then you're like oh gosh i
84:40 gotta do this because i believe this is
84:41 my creator saying this
84:43 so it gets a little strange as well
84:48 it's sort of the the razor's edge
84:51 because on one side of the razor you're
84:53 talking about perhaps being
84:54 indoctrinated into
84:55 mythos that aren't based on any reality
84:59 and then you become susceptible and
85:00 gullible to other things
85:02 and the other side of the razor you have
85:04 a super open mind
85:06 that doesn't pride yourself on
85:08 skepticism
85:10 right skepticism is a faux way to feel
85:13 intelligent i'll just warn you
85:15 you can be brilliant skeptics right the
85:18 the gentleman that was in charge of the
85:19 skeptic society for a long time
85:21 an amazing man he knew all he was a
85:23 magician in his previous life and so
85:25 when he joined the skeptic society
85:27 and eventually ran it he went to south
85:31 america and he was killing a lot of
85:32 placebo techniques
85:34 for healing which had a history of
85:37 working for people because placebo is a
85:39 massive
85:40 method of convincing your body to heal
85:42 itself and so by going down and saying
85:44 this is a fraud
85:45 you guys shouldn't give this guy any
85:47 your money you could be killing more
85:48 people than you save
85:50 and sure someone might have an illness
85:52 that is not curable by these techniques
85:55 i don't think there's anything you can't
85:57 carry your body from i just
85:59 honestly believe that if you get the
86:00 book holographic universe
86:03 there's a section about 40 40 in the
86:06 book where a gentleman had had cancer in
86:08 his pelvis
86:09 he had lost the top half of his femur
86:10 bone big part of his pelvis
86:13 but he was from south america he
86:15 believed in
86:17 healing pools and supposedly he spent
86:19 about a year and a half
86:20 visiting this healing pool and they have
86:22 the before and after x-ray of his body
86:25 and they have him with no femur bone i
86:28 mean you realize there's a ball and
86:29 joint
86:30 in that little area cartilage plates and
86:31 all kinds of stuff right
86:34 and this kid grew it all back and he was
86:36 fine
86:38 there's the old story about the um
86:42 the doctor who had a patient with uh
86:46 lymph node cancer and a pharmaceutical
86:49 company had come up with a shot
86:51 that they said would cure lymph node
86:52 cancer and so the gentleman
86:55 had this it was going to about to go
86:57 into chemo and then he learned about
86:59 this pharmaceutical company
87:00 went to his doctor and said i need you
87:02 to give me that shot i don't want to
87:03 start chemo until i take this shot and
87:05 see if it works
87:06 so he gets the shot and immediately
87:10 starts going into
87:12 a full regression of his cancer but
87:15 the problem is is that the
87:17 pharmaceutical company
87:18 who probably had a cure for cancer to be
87:20 honest was then
87:22 uh kicked out of the fda approval or
87:25 yeah had to have had it and then didn't
87:27 have it
87:29 and um he panicked
87:32 that the shot didn't do anything and so
87:34 his lymph node cancer started coming
87:36 back
87:37 so his doctor knew that he had cured
87:39 himself
87:40 or the shot was working one of the two
87:43 the problem was
87:44 he couldn't get any more of the
87:45 medication because it was forbidden
87:48 so what the doctor did was he got a big
87:50 placebo shot
87:51 and he brings the patient back in and
87:53 says
87:54 okay here's the deal it's all a
87:57 conspiracy
87:58 the shot does work the oncology
88:00 departments of the world who make
88:01 trillions of dollars off of you every
88:02 decade
88:04 just demonize them it does work and i
88:06 managed to get another shot
88:09 and this one's super powerful
88:12 and then he gives the patient the shot
88:16 full regression of his cancer lymph
88:17 nodes all healed up
88:19 cancer all gone and then this story kept
88:22 progressing on this company
88:24 and they just demonized every clinical
88:26 study that they ever did so they
88:27 falsified all the results
88:29 and so the person kept reading that
88:31 until the point where
88:32 he no longer believed that he got the
88:34 shot of of cure
88:36 and died of lymph node cancer
88:39 just something to put in the back of
88:40 your head as you start to analyze data
88:43 as to whether or not you're doing the
88:45 greater good
88:48 posing a bunch of questions is a very
88:51 healthy thing to do for sure
88:53 but at some point you need to kind of
88:54 come over to the
88:56 solution side of things and what i find
88:58 very interesting is is
88:59 you'll have people who espouse their
89:02 philosophy
89:03 which they can't prove at all it could
89:06 be not their fault
89:08 because they don't have the machines or
89:10 the method of doing it
89:11 and there's a bunch of people that might
89:12 believe what they believe which is why
89:14 they do it
89:15 it just seems logical to them and
89:17 there's nothing wrong with that
89:19 but if you see anything against that
89:20 theory they're right after you
89:22 to say how stupid you are or how you
89:25 have to produce a bunch of proof they
89:26 don't have to reproduce anything
89:28 as much as you tell them the proof
89:31 they they won't let it in the door
89:33 because there's like well
89:34 i know you're wrong i'm not really
89:36 interested in your replying
89:38 because i have a paradigm i'm hanging on
89:39 to because i'm a skeptic
89:42 so you know inside the
89:45 the deep thoughts university
89:48 i think we would have phases
89:52 in any analysis of data where we all
89:55 engage in a brainstorming session of
89:57 skepticism against what we think we have
89:59 locked down but it would have to be some
90:03 significant
90:03 in my opinion amount of of contradictory
90:07 evidence
90:08 before we would start to modify what
90:11 we're looking for
90:13 the skepticism built into the scientific
90:15 process
90:16 not pop science but science we like
90:20 is mandatory you want to make your
90:22 theories as bulletproof as possible
90:25 and so try to be on both sides of the
90:28 coin is my
90:29 my advice to you and you'll be a genius
90:30 you'll
90:32 potentially really discover something
90:35 instead of just espousing something
90:38 so anyway that's the bermuda triangle
90:40 episode i hope you dug it
90:43 i have other episodes in the queue
90:46 so we'll see they're not as cool as
90:48 these episodes though they're more the
90:49 cerebral kind
90:50 i love them but only some of you do so
90:53 anyway
90:54 our uh deep thoughts radio can be found
90:57 at deepthoughtsradio.com
90:59 please bookmark that page in case we get
91:00 kicked out there's a little bit of a
91:02 conspiracy going on with youtube right
91:04 now
91:04 in this channel one we know we're shadow
91:07 band
91:08 every video has a peak amount of views
91:10 that it's allowed to have
91:12 and then it gets clobbered down for
91:14 instance the moon episode
91:16 is already at 2000 but i have applied
91:19 and just as an experiment to see if
91:21 they'll remonetize the channel just to
91:22 see what that whole process is like
91:25 inside the qualifications to be
91:26 remonetized which i was
91:29 flying colors man when i applied they
91:31 show me the statistics i have to have a
91:32 certain number of
91:34 constant subscribers and constant views
91:36 to be eligible for
91:38 this evaluation well i've been in
91:40 evaluation stage now since october 30th
91:44 so it's now the middle of december so
91:46 it's been a month and a half they can't
91:47 visit the channel
91:48 but what they're doing is they're
91:49 kicking you guys off subscriptions
91:52 in five pack intervals the first one
91:54 they did was 15
91:56 then they did 10 and now they're just
91:57 doing fives it's almost like they knew
91:59 that we're being too obvious about it
92:01 and so they've dialed it back to fives
92:02 what they're trying to do is kill our
92:04 sub count
92:05 so that i don't qualify just
92:08 just right off the bat so if you can
92:11 pass the channel around
92:12 um you know if you got moon people
92:14 that's a really good episode to send out
92:15 to people
92:16 make sure they subscribe and then we'll
92:19 kick their butt
92:19 at least we won't be disqualified by the
92:22 standards that they set before the
92:24 evaluation actually occurs i'm sure they
92:25 won't do it anyway
92:27 but it's interesting to see how they
92:29 turn this on
92:30 right at october and all through
92:32 november
92:33 they killed us at the beginning of
92:34 november for instance we had uh
92:38 4747
92:40 subscribers uh within a week
92:43 we were down almost below
92:46 so the 47 went below 30. and now we went
92:49 back up to 40 something and now
92:51 this morning we're in the mid-30s it's
92:53 all in one shot and it's always in five
92:55 packs
92:56 the theory that anyone is jumping off
92:58 the channel when no videos are being
93:00 released is pretty
93:02 suspect right if i release a video
93:04 that's very cerebral and nobody likes it
93:06 and 10 people jump off i get it they
93:08 looked at the episode like yeah what is
93:09 this guy telling me i'm out of here
93:11 i don't be notified anymore that makes
93:13 sense
93:15 it's never happened in bit shoot we're
93:17 just climbing
93:18 climbing climbing climbing so for those
93:20 of you who asked me what's your other
93:21 video
93:22 channel it's bid shoot but on the
93:24 website we got two
93:25 video two audio social media
93:28 we have an all new remastered season one
93:31 that's cleaned up it's on a different
93:33 channel because i didn't want to
93:34 interrupt the count on this one as i
93:36 always say
93:37 we have a store with a brand new season
93:39 6 shirt i got a whole new theme that's
93:41 coming out
93:42 where you're going to be able to get
93:43 some deep thoughts university shirts so
