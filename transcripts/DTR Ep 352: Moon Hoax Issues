00:00 [Music]
00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen on this rather sunny but brisk
00:41 and windy day it's almost easier to do
00:43 these at night with 45 degree weather
00:48 and today I am going to be smoking a
00:53 stick from the company la pluma which
00:56 were kind enough to send me a whole box
00:59 of these sticks Principia because the
01:02 name of this particular stick it's a
01:04 nicaragua stick it's got a nice dark
01:07 wrapper construction is really good so
01:10 let's kick off this nasa episode the
01:14 right way hmm well that is a full-body
01:22 taste Nicaraguan cigars are usually very
01:27 full like the tobacco flavor is very
01:29 bold and this definitely has that that
01:32 boldness in it it's only the first
01:35 quarter inch you better get down to its
01:38 mid section I'll report back in so now
01:40 that thick smoke man it's awesome
01:43 something occurred to me
01:45 so NASA's coming up on their 50th year
01:48 anniversary of the moon lie because
01:51 that's what it was and so they're
01:54 reaching out to a bunch of celebrities a
01:55 bunch of people and they are saying
01:58 please please be a part of our thing
02:00 please tell everyone how we went to the
02:02 moon because we're trying to drag a
02:04 bunch of credibility into a completely
02:08 discredited group of events so you know
02:13 last time this particular thing happened
02:16 what are the astronauts mysteriously
02:18 died no hi i falsely said michael
02:21 collins the gentleman who died in 2009 I
02:24 believe was Pete Conrad who lived up in
02:26 Ojai and who knows if it's true but
02:32 around about his time of death his
02:37 friends were excited because he had told
02:39 them that he was going to blow the
02:40 whistle on the moon missions so he
02:44 mysteriously dies of a
02:47 motorcycle accident up in a kind of a
02:49 wooded area of it's sort of northern
02:54 Southern California so if you split the
02:56 country and split the state in half and
02:59 you're traveling north of Los Angeles
03:01 it's just slightly to the east of
03:03 Ventura County I was once at a
03:07 rock-and-roll bachelor party there once
03:09 so we can expect problems for anyone who
03:13 is has a huge audience
03:15 anyone who's onto some evidence that
03:18 perhaps hasn't revealed yet which is
03:19 totally damning if any astronaut is
03:23 making comments on their phone or any
03:28 type of social media that they're
03:29 willing to blow the whistle you can
03:31 expect them to be dead before this
03:33 anniversary happens before their
03:37 intended confession you can expect every
03:42 blowhard shill and you know of all the
03:45 people in the [ __ ] world who believe
03:46 we went to the moon Alex Jones is one of
03:49 them it just really shows you the
03:53 complete [ __ ] lack of capability to
03:55 discern information so they want to say
03:58 that guy works for somebody yeah I think
04:01 so too
04:02 smoking guns or smoking guns people
04:04 you'll see the other episode but now
04:07 imagine we keep waiting for NASA to go
04:11 back to the moon
04:12 to prove that we went to the moon and
04:16 sorry my mind is going back to the Alex
04:19 Jones Joe Rogan interview with the other
04:21 dude who's sort of a big flat earther
04:23 guy they were getting on to the moon
04:25 stuff and Joe seems to have a different
04:29 face I was very proud of Joe he's
04:31 looking at Alex you really think went to
04:33 the moon now Joe is like Pro moon now
04:35 but he was actually anti moon landing
04:39 you know before his show really took off
04:41 but it looks like he might be leaning
04:42 back I'd really want to meet that dude
04:45 but alex is like you know absolutely I
04:49 know people in NASA I'm important [ __ ]
04:52 me my low self-esteem and so then they
04:56 divert the conversation within 60
04:58 seconds over to Flat Earth [ __ ]
05:00 no disrespect to Flat Earth but let's
05:03 stay on [ __ ] topic here and to kid off
05:05 to the Wrights trying to tell Alex the
05:07 moon doesn't exist all of a sudden this
05:08 is [ __ ] Project Blue Beam
05:10 so let's distract away from the
05:11 conversation then alex is able to say oh
05:14 man give me a bunch of give me a [ __ ]
05:16 break I got a 12 inch reflector
05:18 telescope at home and I can see the moon
05:20 it's not [ __ ] transparent it really
05:22 exists and so now we're off the subject
05:24 of any [ __ ] evidence the proves that
05:26 we didn't go didn't address it it's sort
05:32 of important I don't know to me it is
05:36 are there more important conspiracies oh
05:38 yeah [ __ ] yeah but this one is important
05:41 it's inside the envelope of spin some
05:44 calorie energy on this from time to time
05:46 all right but back to this other subject
05:49 we wait for net we're waiting for NASA
05:51 to go back with a brand new updated
05:54 platform brand new boosters brand new
05:57 propulsion brand new life-support brand
05:59 new radiation shielding maybe even
06:04 takeoff from the space station up there
06:06 if it's real all right I got a new
06:11 challenge for NASA and I think you
06:14 should challenge them as well exactly to
06:17 the T of what I am going to suggest and
06:19 I think it would be awesome to see some
06:22 sweat beads flowing down their temple
06:25 just like in the movie Total Recall when
06:27 the psychologist got his [ __ ] head
06:29 blown off because he was lying we need
06:33 to force NASA to go back to the moon and
06:36 a Saturn 5 in the Apollo 11 capsule as
06:41 designed back in those days I mean [ __ ]
06:44 we got copies of Mir on earth you can't
06:46 use modern boosters you can't use
06:50 Russian technology you've got to use the
06:52 f1 boosters as recovered out of the
06:55 Atlantic Ocean you don't use those but
06:59 you have to create them from scratch and
07:01 use the materials that they used you
07:04 can't use titanium if they were using
07:06 stainless steel you can't use some type
07:09 of ceramic if we were using rubber
07:11 you've got to use everything that they
07:13 use back in
07:14 days you can't use modern computer
07:15 technology either use your [ __ ] rope
07:18 memory use your battery system however
07:23 the [ __ ] you kept these guys alive we
07:27 want you to recreate Apollo 11 and
07:31 Apollo 17 and I think that the two
07:35 astronauts that should go up there
07:37 because they're not astronauts but we
07:38 need to we need to force them to be up
07:41 there the two that are gonna go to the
07:43 moon and step on the moon is gonna be
07:45 Neil deGrasse Tyson and Bill Nye the
07:47 douchebag guy those are two guys that
07:50 need to go up there Alex Jones can be in
07:52 the lunar orbiter or he can go on the
07:54 separate mission it's like 17 let's send
07:57 them up let's send them up and the only
08:00 modern technology that one can take up
08:02 with them is a video camera to transmit
08:06 to earth constantly because hey they
08:09 were able to do it in 1969 so I'm sure
08:13 50 years later this won't be a problem
08:15 right now what's funny about that whole
08:18 challenge is that we know they can't do
08:19 it we know that everyone would die don't
08:24 we we need to force them to take the
08:27 Hasselblad replicas up there exactly
08:29 constructed like the ones that they
08:31 brought back I have to take thirty five
08:34 millimeter film are not 35 min or
08:36 whatever that forgot what the size of
08:39 the film is for the Hasselblad but that
08:40 film you can bring maybe some other
08:44 modern equipment just a little bit
08:46 because you know hey wait is a big deal
08:48 until they wanted to bring up the buggy
08:50 and Apollo 15 now what they also need to
08:53 do is lend generally close enough to a
08:55 previous landing that we can see the
08:59 other lunar module the sorry the
09:01 kickstand of it we want to find the
09:04 buggy and we want to find an American
09:06 flag I want all the evidence of all the
09:09 footprints and I want the vistas to
09:11 match perfectly to the photography that
09:15 was captured by Neil Armstrong and all
09:17 the other dudes who took pictures
09:20 because they might be able to get up
09:22 there and put stuff down on the ground
09:24 with other technology but they're not
09:26 going to be able to easily terraform
09:28 the surface of the Moon to match two
09:31 different missions that were several
09:34 hundred miles apart from each other with
09:35 the exact same background that's not
09:38 going to be possible is it ooh isn't
09:40 that a wonderful thing you just got them
09:42 by the short hairs immediately when you
09:44 do that now this year it has been an
09:47 interesting year for the individuals
09:51 that come around every once in a while
09:52 and chill out in the comments section
09:57 now it's nice is we're not getting a ton
09:59 and of course the the the video on
10:02 smoking guns is probably the most
10:04 popular video I've ever put out and that
10:07 it's not a week old yet and it's gonna
10:10 be cresting probably 5,000 views in
10:13 seven days which is pretty phenomenal
10:16 where we have gathered almost a hundred
10:19 no we're well over a hundred new
10:21 subscribers in one week due to that
10:23 video which is cool people are waking up
10:26 now what's interesting is it and this is
10:28 a beautiful opportunity for me to
10:30 compliment all of you guys and gals
10:33 those of you are commenting about your
10:37 experience of waking up to the moon hoax
10:39 you're so articulate you're so on
10:42 intelligence you give out these
10:43 incredible stories you describe your
10:46 frustration with having ever believed
10:48 and it's isn't it like psychotherapy is
10:51 it like I just need to tell somebody I'm
10:53 so furious that I believe this for a
10:55 long time or some people aren't really
10:57 upset I was never really furious ever in
11:00 my life about it I just said Wow no [ __ ]
11:03 you know part of me is just marveling
11:06 over the fact that they were able to
11:07 pull this off so part of me and if you
11:09 push me into a room with all the old
11:11 dudes who put this hoax together I mean
11:15 I'm I'm gonna have a lot of respect for
11:17 these guys feels like you did it I mean
11:20 like unbelievable you pulled it off who
11:22 took care of publishing who took care of
11:24 you know space food how did you who is
11:28 the team that handled the capsule
11:30 falling back in the ocean and which one
11:31 did this and that right but I mean
11:33 what's funny about the ones that are
11:35 coming in against this truth that it was
11:40 a hoax
11:40 you know there are some really
11:42 articulate people who do disagree with
11:44 us and they just do a gentle nice
11:47 presentation for what they believe in
11:49 man total respect total respect for
11:52 those individuals but the idiots shills
11:55 that come in and it's interesting it's
11:58 like NASA seems to it's either one of
12:02 two things right you have organic people
12:04 that don't believe and then pity on
12:07 their soul right and then you have folks
12:08 that come in that are obviously out
12:10 doing business and they are the most
12:13 it's just like the astronauts they're so
12:16 [ __ ] ill-informed it's unbelievable
12:18 they don't know any of the issues if
12:20 they're debunking something it's it's
12:22 laughable
12:24 you know if NASA said that you know
12:27 Afghans made of synthetic yarn protects
12:31 against thermal radiation or whatever
12:35 they'll just buy it they just buy it and
12:38 believe it and then they throw it back
12:39 out in the comments section you're kind
12:41 of like really you honestly just by that
12:43 because NASA said it you're not gonna go
12:45 look anything up to find out what's what
12:47 one of the trends I'm getting and I'm
12:49 covering this because the 50th
12:51 anniversary is coming up and I got some
12:56 big plans for that little 50th
12:57 anniversary thing at least one really
13:00 fricking cool thing that's going to
13:02 occur so we need to kind of get our
13:05 ducks in a row but the one thing is you
13:09 know I get these folks who come in and
13:11 tell me how much I don't understand
13:12 about physics or cosmology or
13:16 what-have-you and I mean I'm like a
13:17 40-year vet of this [ __ ]
13:19 and so you know I've been off on fifteen
13:24 year research programs for the unified
13:27 theory using one all the classic
13:30 Newtonian relativity quantum physics
13:34 side of things and then finally finally
13:37 due to electric Eric dollar the electric
13:39 universe theories which then reintroduce
13:42 ether and then everything is resolved
13:46 and I mean you have a physical model for
13:47 everything there's nothing more
13:49 beautiful to the heart than a physical
13:51 model for the physical world that you
13:53 live in
13:54 and once you go back into those other
13:55 realms you are dealing with theoretical
13:59 models so one of the comments species
14:03 I'm getting lately is you know the whole
14:05 thing about my knowledge of physics and
14:08 my knowledge II of cosmology and space
14:10 travel and what-have-you and you know I
14:12 don't have any easy ability to get into
14:16 astrophysics but a lot of it's just
14:19 basic trajectories thrusts things the
14:22 video game engines have had for years
14:23 and so the funny thing is you have some
14:27 Schmo sitting in his basement you know
14:30 sweating sausage and cheese and topping
14:34 off his World of Warcraft account coming
14:36 at me and he's never programmed a video
14:39 game in his life so he's never had a
14:40 program like a missile being launched
14:43 and the physics of a missile being
14:45 launched of its trajectory it's heat
14:48 sinking capabilities you know you know
14:51 I've programmed Jesus Christ probably
14:53 half a dozen animation engines so it's
14:55 the engine that everyone else uses that
14:57 has this physics built-in frame rate
15:00 throttling and all that kind of stuff so
15:03 I'm not completely ignorant about the
15:07 ability to create a rocket and give it
15:09 thrust and deal with I mean we don't put
15:13 in like environmental issues inside
15:16 videogames right so we don't say oh
15:17 there's a side wind if we want to make a
15:19 flag wave and the wind sure we create a
15:22 little particle system that starts you
15:25 know you know hitting the colliding with
15:28 the polygons we have a memory and then
15:29 we do a transformation on it and blah
15:31 blah blah and then you know the funny
15:35 thing is is when you're in the video
15:37 game industry you know I was there in
15:40 the 2d world and then followed in
15:43 through the transition in the 1990s
15:45 about 95 or so we acquired EA Canada and
15:49 so I was doing all kinds of research in
15:53 it and from 87 all the way to 95 trying
15:56 to program my own 3d engines and so you
16:00 get into a lot of them the needs of
16:03 simulating reality because you can't
16:06 afford to do it
16:07 inside of 3d 6 or 486 computer you just
16:11 can't doesn't have the horsepower and so
16:13 you do as much as you possibly can pre
16:15 calculating sine cosine algorithms into
16:19 tables that you can look up really
16:20 quickly so you don't have to do this
16:21 heavy crunching mathematics and that's
16:23 what a lot of the loading bars were back
16:25 in the day with games like doom 1 and
16:29 and further beyond that so we're
16:31 calculating a bunch of tables in memory
16:33 you know I've programmed floating-point
16:35 precision mathematics in CPUs that can't
16:40 do floating-point algorithms and so
16:43 there's a technique of using integer
16:45 based math because you're just moving a
16:47 decimal place around you so to figure
16:49 out where your decimal places but it's
16:50 all it's all manual so when I get these
16:54 folks coming and going man you don't
16:55 know nothing about physics man and then
16:58 my my new protocol with them is to go
17:00 fine amen maybe you're right what
17:03 glaring [ __ ] problem am i presenting
17:06 in my videos because I don't talk about
17:07 physics you know in any tremendous way
17:10 in a tremendous level of details so I'm
17:12 not sure what algorithm get I'm getting
17:13 wrong but hey good for you like I said
17:16 in a previous episode just recorded the
17:20 posts are free just enlighten us but
17:24 between the 1i Kreuk orded a couple days
17:26 ago and now which neither one of them
17:28 are up of course yet by the time this
17:30 one's up the other one's gonna be up it
17:33 just dawned on me that the 50th
17:34 anniversary is coming up and it's gonna
17:36 be a big deal
17:37 they are going to blow this one out
17:39 hardcore and they're going to it's one
17:42 of these things of you know if it's
17:44 gonna be the 51st and 51st anniversary
17:46 there's no money allocated to working on
17:52 the moon mission hoax cover-up I mean
17:54 there is but it's not that much and now
17:55 we're coming up on the 50th there's
17:58 going to be millions of dollars spent on
18:00 the promo for this event and so that's
18:03 going to create a lot of search keyword
18:06 stuff and all of your search engines on
18:08 YouTube every social media platform and
18:10 you can bet your bottom dollar that the
18:13 censorship and the shadow banning is
18:16 going to throttle up just up to the apex
18:19 of the 50th and it's going to hang for
18:21 few weeks and then it'll all come down
18:22 and then it'll be easy to find these
18:24 videos again but I'm sure that you know
18:26 the week of the 50th finding this
18:29 channel organically if you're not
18:30 subscribed to it is going to be
18:31 relatively impossible so here's the
18:36 thing we need to spread the news okay
18:41 here's my challenge to you guys they're
18:43 not really a challenge but a request you
18:46 know I make new videos some of you
18:48 really love them some of you like mine
18:51 but love others here's what we need to
18:55 do and I'm gonna be doing this myself we
18:57 need to promote what videos we think are
18:59 the best videos in the world for the
19:02 moon hoax as it comes up to the 50th and
19:05 the week of the 50th anniversary which
19:07 you should be like July 16th or
19:09 something like that we should push extra
19:13 hard those last two weeks where the week
19:15 two weeks before we push hard week on
19:18 top push extra hard and we need to push
19:22 it into comments outside of the standard
19:28 areas where they have censorship
19:29 capabilities so news sites your Twitter
19:32 account personally other people's
19:34 Twitter responses remember someone
19:36 posted a thread about something and you
19:38 can reply and you can usually hot link a
19:40 video into a reply with some platforms
19:43 you can post things that you might not
19:46 want to be your permanent record and
19:49 then delete them a month later if that's
19:51 better for you now what I love
19:54 personally for this this particular
19:57 channel to take off I think yeah I mean
20:01 it's a hell of a thing to have a million
20:03 subscribers I'm sure but it's a lot
20:05 different than having 4,000 subscribers
20:08 and so you know I do my best to read all
20:12 of your comments and try to reply to
20:13 them and right now 4,000 the flow is
20:16 actually pretty good you know those of
20:18 you who are part of the channel on
20:20 YouTube you understand that a lot of you
20:23 guys are routine commenters and again I
20:26 just love you guys to death because I
20:28 look forward to some of you because
20:30 you'll go away for a little while
20:31 because the videos I'm producing are
20:34 that you want to chime in on and then I
20:35 produce one that's your cup of tea and
20:38 then Kapow you guys post and it's
20:40 amazing now some of you folks I think a
20:43 lot of the women to be honest are more
20:46 cerebral metaphysical they really love
20:49 the the sort of social based episodes or
20:53 self-help based based episodes and so I
20:55 got a lot of great comments from them
20:57 when I switch over to the moon or
20:59 something a little more Top Fuel the
21:01 guys chimed in so it's a very
21:03 interesting thing we don't have on the
21:05 channel too many females I'm not even
21:08 I'm below a double-digit so it's
21:10 probably like 8% at the top to 5% female
21:15 so I you need to know that on my end of
21:19 the deal I'm always seeking out the
21:22 female perspective because I think I've
21:24 got the male perspective pretty much
21:26 locked down so I want to know when I
21:27 write a movie I might give it to a guy
21:30 but I try to give it to three or four
21:31 women or at least read it to them if I
21:34 have access to them so I get their
21:36 opinion because it's important just to
21:37 see that dimension even if my movies
21:39 completely going for a guy demographic I
21:41 want to see how well it plays because if
21:43 there's some little thread in there you
21:45 during the plot of the subplot that a
21:46 woman's interested in and it's easy for
21:49 me to jack it up a little bit more
21:50 before I hand it in to my agent then
21:53 that's where I go
21:54 so yeah this moon anniversaries coming
21:59 if I were an astronaut I wouldn't run my
22:02 mouth and need my friends if I was going
22:03 to stand up at a podium and say it was
22:05 all fake and what's interesting about
22:07 this is every single day in astronauts
22:10 alive they have the opportunity to
22:11 redeem their soul to us the people of
22:15 this planet God already knows it was a
22:18 hoax and like I said in a previous show
22:20 waiting to tell God that it was a hoax
22:23 is sort of a big [ __ ] waste of time
22:26 for an astronaut to be a complete
22:29 atheist a secular atheist means they've
22:31 had to deny throughout their entire
22:33 lifetime all evidence that there's life
22:36 after death and all instincts that I
22:39 think are inside mankind that that urine
22:42 to a creator so it's interesting
22:44 now I created an episode about deal
22:47 with the moon hoax because I think
22:49 that's SuperDuper important and I've
22:50 been sort of linking it around a little
22:52 bit inside all the butthurt comments
22:53 which again are very minimal but I'm
22:57 glad I did that because it does address
22:59 the issue for folks but there's there's
23:01 sort of this and this is what this
23:04 episode is about is there's this cloud
23:08 of social issues and anxiety and
23:12 psychoses around the moon hoax that I
23:16 don't think we're dealing with
23:18 I mean imagine that and here's a better
23:20 way for me to describe it let's say Buzz
23:22 Aldrin in his dementia Alzheimer's state
23:25 whatever he's in now I mean it looks
23:28 like he told this little Latin girl that
23:31 we didn't go to the moon it's because
23:34 because we didn't go I mean I don't know
23:35 it sounded like it's what he said maybe
23:37 someone did he used cars thing on him
23:39 and swapped out the syllables so it
23:41 sound like that's what are you saying
23:43 I'd rather know that and believe that he
23:46 said the other thing well let's say he
23:48 goes up to the podium and as a
23:52 last-ditch effort to to D compromise his
23:57 soul to the rest of us he says look we
24:01 didn't go nobody went and they can shoot
24:04 me right now but I'm gonna go meet my
24:06 Maker having told my fellow man and the
24:09 fellow souls on this point at the truth
24:11 they have held me hostage with my life
24:15 with my family's life with my pension
24:19 but now Donald Trump has nailed the CIA
24:22 and I can say this and I think I'm gonna
24:24 live but even if they kill me the second
24:25 I walk out of this room if I have a
24:27 massive heart attack at least when I
24:29 meet my Maker we don't even have to have
24:32 the conversation alright so he says that
24:35 now what do you do with all those
24:38 butthurt baby boomers the a couple gins
24:44 ears like Alex Jones let's still believe
24:48 I mean it's so sad it's so sad when
24:51 people hang on to this [ __ ] but they
24:56 also hang on to fake religion to just
24:58 really really really [ __ ] sad
25:00 it would you know what that does to me
25:03 personally just so you know is when when
25:07 I was a kid I had two two stuffed bears
25:12 mom was named John he was the bigger one
25:14 maybe like 18 inches tall the other one
25:17 was named AKEL I don't know where the
25:20 hell that name came from and you he was
25:22 a little tiny one and a coal had all
25:24 these problems man I'd play with him so
25:26 much he just fell apart so my mom kept
25:29 putting patches on him you know if some
25:31 of the people have stuffed animals they
25:33 call patches because it fell apart so
25:35 damn fast you know got some more patches
25:37 than its original skin a bunch of skin
25:39 grafts oh they'll be the stick is mild
25:42 beautiful nice tobacco flavor you'd even
25:48 retro it without a lot of burn that's
25:50 amazing
25:51 just a really good taste it's kind of I
25:53 think that's a short filler because it's
25:54 going out pretty quick here I'm only 30
25:56 minutes in it's almost gone but it's a
25:58 nice quick stick but so I had a teddy
26:01 bear as a kid and of course I was a
26:03 child I was trying to find a friend when
26:06 no one else was in the room because you
26:08 know human beings were born created to
26:11 be with each other you're supposed to be
26:13 with your family the whole time but when
26:16 ends up happening is second you build a
26:17 house a shelter now your child is in a
26:21 different room than you are and they
26:23 can't see you and so that can be
26:25 something that makes you a little
26:26 insecure mom needs a break dad has to go
26:29 to work when mom goes to work the kids
26:31 completely [ __ ] right so you carry
26:33 around this little piece of orientation
26:35 to your universe and I was fairly proud
26:40 when I was able to get rid of this thing
26:43 I shed it I have friends in their
26:47 [ __ ] 50s who still have the blanket
26:49 when they were a child all right and
26:52 it's all [ __ ] mangled thread and [ __ ]
26:54 and they still have it in their bedroom
26:56 at night because they can't not pee with
26:59 it all right I mean god damn blows my
27:02 mind people hang on to that [ __ ] and
27:04 they'll tell you about it like they're
27:06 [ __ ] proud of it you're like you
27:08 should see a doctor I mean you should
27:09 really [ __ ] try to get out of your
27:13 figure out it you know
27:14 pretty pre-adolescent your utter
27:18 babyhood of existence you know but then
27:21 you see alex jones i want to like this
27:25 guy he was definitely responsible for
27:27 waking me up to a ton of issues I mean
27:30 if I don't even think I could quantify
27:32 on a piece of paper everything this guy
27:34 woke me up to to be hundreds and
27:37 hundreds of threads that were rabbit
27:39 holes that I had to spend years
27:41 researching and I think he's right about
27:44 a lot of stuff but he also has to
27:50 promote his ego constantly it's the big
27:52 [ __ ] me show you know someone
27:54 commented the day gives a man you didn't
27:56 say who you were then one of the
27:57 comments I'm like [ __ ] cares Who I am
28:00 is this information valuable well there
28:03 you go when you join the Facebook
28:05 Facebook group and we can have a good
28:07 conversation you can personally become
28:09 my friend a deep mind account you can
28:11 chat me personally it takes me a little
28:13 while to get back to some of you guys
28:14 and I do apologize because for those of
28:17 you who chat me with really good content
28:19 you'll send me big articles references
28:22 to books 3-hour videos and they're great
28:25 they're great references and things that
28:27 I need to watch and that will create
28:29 multiple episodes as a result of
28:31 consuming but based on my life and other
28:35 things it's a little tough sometimes
28:38 so when I see Alex and he's got this
28:44 rewatching Arrested Development I'm
28:46 studying all the writing at Arrested
28:47 Development having just finished Frasier
28:50 they they have this spoof on girls gone
28:54 wild and it's it the name of it is girls
28:57 with low self-esteem it's absolutely
28:59 brilliant
29:00 the girls are low self-esteem are
29:02 showing their tits in public because
29:04 that patches all the other mental issues
29:07 they have what was it the sister she
29:11 tried to protest one of the rallies in
29:14 the showdown on Newport Boulevard which
29:16 is probably shot in Marina del Rey and
29:18 the guy from Scrubs is playing the dude
29:20 who owns the series and he brings down
29:22 all these hot girls with big boobs and
29:24 they're protesting against this show
29:27 rubes thing and within two seconds the
29:29 guys got all their all of them flashing
29:31 their boobs and and the grossest this
29:34 isn't a way to get closer to your father
29:36 or closer to your daddy you're getting
29:38 noticed by your dad or something you
29:40 know because there's always a father
29:40 issue behind women with low self-esteem
29:43 god bless you guys right men have a
29:45 different Oedipus thing right thank God
29:49 I didn't give a [ __ ] either way if I
29:51 gave a [ __ ] about being ignored from my
29:52 parents oh my god I'd be completely
29:54 [ __ ] huddled in some rubber room
29:56 wearing a straitjacket mumbling some
29:59 foreign alphabet but so Alex got Alex
30:03 has this thing he's always talking about
30:05 his religion constantly a guy who's that
30:09 awake who still believes in man-made
30:11 religions blows my mind it's a little
30:13 teddy bear
30:13 it's a [ __ ] teddy bear and the moon
30:16 missions for me is his teddy bear that
30:18 is just crossing too many [ __ ] lines
30:21 for his brain and so he's got his teddy
30:23 bear oh I'm sure he'd yell and scream at
30:25 you if you know if I had him on another
30:26 microphone and sitting here on the patio
30:28 because once you start threatening
30:31 someone's security blanket they'll [ __ ]
30:35 you up you know I mean it's just like
30:36 there's an there's an alcoholic defends
30:39 a drink like a child and so if you had a
30:42 woman with a child her baby her newborn
30:45 or a guy who's gonna [ __ ] and protect
30:47 any anyone's baby let alone their own
30:49 and you try to touch that kid they're
30:51 going to metamorphosize into the most
30:53 lethal weapon in the world and they'll
30:55 come after you and they should but it
30:58 happens for alcoholics with their
31:00 alcohol drug addicted people for their
31:03 drugs and organized religion on earth is
31:06 one of those things and the moon
31:08 landings are a [ __ ] Santa Clause
31:10 story they are it's designed to make you
31:13 feel good about yourself I think it was
31:15 interesting on the Joe Rogan show that
31:17 when Alex was defending him on the moon
31:21 landings
31:21 his only rebuttal was that he knew
31:24 famous people in NASA and there's the
31:27 low self-esteem thing coming back up Joe
31:30 I'm so [ __ ] amazing I know all these
31:32 people at NASA I know them and I know
31:35 that they went up there and they did
31:36 this and he's changing the subject
31:37 immediately I know people on the space
31:39 station I know people in the shuttle
31:41 Graham and or something like that I
31:43 never mentioned the shuttle but he was
31:44 just trying to say I know all these
31:46 people that it uh okay what's that have
31:50 to do with the technical impossibility
31:52 that this [ __ ] ever occurred go look at
31:54 The Smoking Gun [ __ ] deal with all that
31:56 [ __ ] go look at all the other half dozen
31:59 episodes I've made and deal with all of
32:00 it now again some of the things we might
32:03 be concerned about what the moon landing
32:06 like the rock with the sea on it maybe
32:07 there's a complete explanation for that
32:09 don't them that we just don't know I do
32:11 believe that it is true that the little
32:13 fold and the rock is a shadow from an
32:17 antenna I do believe that now because
32:18 you can see the preceding shadow coming
32:20 up to it and it looks just like
32:21 something's popped off I think that's
32:24 what that is very glad someone pointed
32:26 out to me in the comments once I looked
32:29 at it boom it automatically became
32:30 something I can see and what was funny
32:32 was I don't remember the antenna shadow
32:35 being one of the debunking things on the
32:38 NASA web site way back in whatever it
32:41 was 2000 2005 somewhere in there so we
32:44 all evolved some of that evidence isn't
32:47 good that's why we gotta let go of that
32:48 [ __ ] so that we don't walk into a room
32:50 and use poor evidence as a way of
32:52 proving our point false evidence you
32:55 know my concern with this whole thing
32:58 and this is everyone I think is it's
33:02 everyone's concern we express it
33:03 differently is that as a society truth
33:07 is a vibration it's a complete vibration
33:10 and again that's why partial truths have
33:13 a partial vibration complete lies have a
33:15 totally different visceral Sawtooth
33:18 vibration that hurts again when you lie
33:22 you take it inside and when you take it
33:24 inside you develop physical issues
33:27 physical problems I think one of the
33:30 reasons why I look really young for my
33:32 age is I don't lie I don't step on
33:35 people's heads to the best of my ability
33:37 can I get pissed off at people lying oh
33:40 [ __ ] yeah right absolutely do I deal
33:43 with you know people lying to me
33:45 personally in a way that you would want
33:47 your grandmother in the room listening
33:48 to me speak no not even your parents
33:51 maybe not even you so
33:54 you know I think that people who die of
33:59 cancer we know that stress is a huge
34:02 factor in that it was just announced
34:05 that Alec Alex Trebek has stage 4
34:07 pancreatic cancer
34:09 yikes you know I mean I was a guy a
34:11 vegan or something I mean but he's been
34:14 making that show for 50 years or
34:16 whatever 40 years shows like that are
34:19 extremely stressful to create I mean I'm
34:23 hoping that now for the last maybe 20
34:25 years it's been a cakewalk for the guy
34:27 but he personally is involved in the
34:29 show he personally keeps the integrity
34:32 of the rules and the presentation
34:34 together
34:35 I'm sure if the stage is redesigned he
34:37 participates in that so I bet he carries
34:40 a big burden on his back and it's it's a
34:44 sad thing that is it would be a sad
34:47 thing if that stress has related to his
34:49 cancer let's hope he watches our cancer
34:52 episode and gets himself cleaned up by
34:54 the way I want to report back in I eat
35:00 at this taco place down the street here
35:03 in Huntington Beach and about probably
35:08 five or six months ago that actually
35:10 would have been last August as a matter
35:12 of fact because I went to Australia and
35:14 came back and this is when I was
35:18 approached by this but this woman was
35:20 telling me her friend was and I think it
35:23 was stage 4 cancer and so all of us
35:25 swooped in with our b-17 vitamin-c fix
35:31 and the woman and no sugar no meat so
35:35 she went way down in her diet nailed all
35:38 those catalystic nutrients the cancer
35:41 cut those out of her diet takes her see
35:44 and hers b-17 and she is now feeling
35:48 amazing I'm supposed to talk to her here
35:51 because she also found out that she had
35:53 been prescribed some drugs by her doctor
35:55 for the last 10 years of her life at
35:58 coincidentally 10 times the amount of
36:01 body should be consuming so she had a
36:03 drug that may be the very cause for her
36:07 cancer
36:08 and it could be a gigantic malpractice
36:11 situation for her so the [ __ ] works man
36:15 episode 17
36:18 now I'm gonna pepper episodes for a
36:21 little while announcing this new thing
36:23 so season 1 and I know we're on the moon
36:27 thing we'll get back to that in just a
36:28 second season 1 was very it was me
36:31 getting the show together so figuring
36:32 out the format figuring how to cut it
36:33 together how was I gonna do all the
36:35 intros and the outros and so I have made
36:40 the executive decision because other
36:42 other services are coming online
36:43 especially kim.com
36:45 hopefully this year it launches his new
36:46 social media platform when that occurs I
36:49 need to have all the videos ready to go
36:51 to upload on the first day and so season
36:54 one needs to be overhauled for editing
36:57 for the intros can take away all the
36:59 copyrighted music unfortunately it's
37:02 really sad because I want to make sure
37:03 they have style and I was able to find
37:05 songs eventually that matched the actual
37:07 subject matter of the show so it's a
37:09 bummer when they don't go through and
37:11 again I have to salute all the artists
37:13 that don't put out that copyright crap
37:15 on the videos because you have big
37:18 artists like Ice Cube Kid Rock I think
37:23 even Black Sabbath cease to to gank my
37:26 monetization but they're cool I mean you
37:29 know if you hear like half of war pigs
37:31 right before I mean honestly like a
37:34 verse of war pigs right before I do a
37:35 war episode you're like oh yeah that is
37:37 a great [ __ ] song I'm gonna go buy
37:39 that album I'm gonna buy that single
37:40 there you go it's worth way more than a
37:43 few pennies you're gonna get off one of
37:44 my episodes that I was like 300 views
37:47 back in the day but a lot of that
37:48 copyright stuff prevented people from
37:50 seeing it especially in the country of
37:51 Germany and so cleaning all this off all
37:55 the episodes rebranding them it's gonna
37:57 have a really really short intro but
37:59 there's a brand new channel out there
38:00 that's gonna be just episode one it's
38:03 called deep thoughts radio season 1 and
38:06 so for those of you are interested in
38:08 getting those if you're in Europe I
38:09 suggest getting over there and
38:11 subscribing and then you'll be able to
38:14 see the videos perhaps you've never seen
38:15 before and we can get some of these
38:17 things out of the hundreds and put them
38:19 in the thousands where they belong so
38:21 the point of making this episode is one
38:22 to kind of highlight in your mind the
38:24 fact that this 50th anniversary is
38:26 coming ask you anon would say we need to
38:30 be on suicide watch for folks both folks
38:34 like us that are spreading the news of
38:38 the moon hoax and those that are
38:40 involved who maybe want to get out of
38:42 this horrible sinful existence they have
38:46 against humanity so I don't know if
38:49 they're going to do this under Trump's
38:50 administration where folks are
38:52 completely different you know all the
38:54 corruptions being canceled NSA programs
38:57 are being canceled to spy on phones now
39:00 I want to make a little point there that
39:02 the NSA is simply said that they're not
39:05 seizing phone records anymore phone
39:10 records is a way different thing than
39:13 since then taking a copy of every phone
39:15 call we ever make that's still occurring
39:17 just the records from your phone company
39:20 need to be subpoenaed through the FISA
39:22 Court if they want to figure out you
39:25 know well I mean honestly it's it's all
39:27 in that it's all in the metadata of a
39:29 phone call so they probably have all
39:31 this anyway but they won't necessarily
39:33 require Verizon to give you give the NSA
39:36 the information on a routine basis
39:38 because that extremely violates the
39:41 Fourth Amendment of the Constitution I
39:42 mean we are operating in this country
39:44 right now of the Constitution in large
39:48 part suspended and everyone that's told
39:51 that your income tax is a mandatory tax
39:54 you know it only applies if you're doing
39:56 corporations Tobacco and Firearms those
40:00 are the three categories where taxes
40:02 were set up to tax the people and my
40:05 Trump just said in a recent speech we
40:08 had so much money that we didn't know
40:10 where to spend it and so that's why Wars
40:11 start because that drains your bank
40:13 account instantaneously and you have to
40:14 borrow money to fight wars which is why
40:16 he is stopping all the wars and getting
40:19 all of our soldiers back home because
40:21 then we stop borrowing money and stop
40:23 pissing off the entire world in the name
40:25 of America you know when I grew up again
40:28 when I grew up and it's part of the NASA
40:31 mythos America was the
40:34 the big giant Cowboys that ran around
40:36 you know shooting people because they
40:39 snored at night sort of thing it just
40:41 took nothing for us to invade your
40:43 country [ __ ] up everything and of course
40:45 for the last 20 years since 9/11 that's
40:48 pretty much been the case they just
40:50 remotely associate you and because we've
40:52 been a gigantic Thor's hammer for the
40:55 bankers you know the bankers are back
40:57 there at the handle holding on to this
40:59 beautiful sledge hammer of Thor and we
41:04 are the ones pounding other countries
41:06 for not being in the World Bank system
41:07 not being in the petrol dollar system
41:09 and it's been a bad it's been a bad 20
41:13 years it's it was bad before that but I
41:17 got really really bad this last 20 years
41:19 trying to take over this country and
41:20 destroy it what I find utterly and
41:23 completely fascinating about the moon
41:25 hoax is that it really brings out the
41:28 internal emotions from individuals as to
41:33 their frailties it also pulls out the
41:36 integrity of individuals because they
41:39 you can tell if someone really wants to
41:41 believe the truth and again we don't
41:43 have everything right because there's no
41:45 disclosure as to how they did it wrong
41:48 how they faked it so we're doing our
41:50 best
41:51 now imagine first what second someone
41:55 gave you a magic wand and you were to
41:58 wave it and your only wish is like the
42:02 little kid to blow out the cake and liar
42:04 liar and he made it impossible for
42:06 anyone in the world to tell a lie it'd
42:10 be funny how fast the 50th anniversary
42:12 of the moon hoax would be canceled
42:14 wouldn't it be interesting to see who
42:18 would stop taking interviews wouldn't it
42:20 I think the Democratic Party would cease
42:23 to exist
42:24 overnight global warming / the rebranded
42:27 [ __ ] climate change would disappear
42:29 no one could tell a lie when that would
42:32 undermine everything pharmaceutical
42:35 companies and hospitals would disappear
42:37 and be rebirthed as potentially old
42:40 hospitals where doctors came to your
42:42 house to take care of you it was be on a
42:44 case-by-case basis instead of these
42:46 generalizations as to how
42:48 medicate the entire world with things
42:50 like fluoride and horrible vaccinations
42:52 which activate viruses which basically
42:55 inject you with live viruses science
42:59 would completely change wouldn't it we'd
43:01 have no more BIGBANG [ __ ] we'd have
43:03 no more black hole [ __ ]
43:07 gravity would would move from a
43:08 phenomenon of the matter pulling against
43:11 matter to the physical model that
43:14 actually works which is ether all wind /
43:17 ether water pushing everything together
43:20 just like a bubble in water it does pay
43:23 me to see the comment that gravity is
43:26 [ __ ] that pains me a little bit you
43:30 obviously experience it every single
43:33 moment of your life and it doesn't
43:35 matter if the world spinning or the
43:36 world is stationary that force is on you
43:39 constantly if I drop something it falls
43:42 and hits the ground I don't know how
43:43 many of you have broken something you
43:45 really loved because it hit the ground
43:47 you know when I first bought my first
43:49 guitar which I just mentioned a previous
43:51 episode I had a microphone stand that
43:54 had a rivet up here at the top it was a
43:57 cheapy ass thing I didn't realize it at
44:00 the time but it was about to strip out
44:02 and I had my guitar lacquer black
44:04 beautiful acoustic guitar sitting
44:06 against my wall and I was turning the
44:08 microphone and I watched it turn on its
44:11 own I was far enough away I couldn't
44:13 grab it and it spun off the stand spun
44:16 around and the ass end of the microphone
44:19 slammed my guitar and put a nice little
44:21 dime sized perforation in the lacquer
44:24 right down to the wood it's my little
44:27 scar on the on the guitar pisses me off
44:29 right so that didn't happen because of
44:32 some mysterious gremlin that came in and
44:35 waved a wand and put a hold of my guitar
44:36 it's because my microphone stand fell
44:39 down okay the ether winds of the
44:42 universe penetrating the roof of my
44:45 house still grabbed on to that
44:47 microphone stand in our microphone top
44:50 part and pushed it down into my guitar
44:52 it's a real thing now yes all the
44:55 official definitions in science with
44:58 flying quotes are incorrect
45:01 again if you stopped at at the
45:06 plagiarist wife-beater Einstein by the
45:11 way I'm almost done with my research on
45:12 Einstein that is a deep-ass rabbit hole
45:15 man oh my god because once you find out
45:18 that he plagiarized actually it's his
45:19 wife that did all the work for him when
45:21 she plagiarized everything and handed it
45:23 up to him to present you need to do the
45:27 research in the individuals that
45:28 actually were the brainiacs that
45:31 actually figured out his concepts I
45:33 think they're still incorrect in most
45:35 cases a lot of the results that were
45:38 presented on his behalf by other folks
45:41 were forged and fraudulent because other
45:45 people wanted to write on the coattails
45:46 of financing that comes with new
45:49 epiphanies in science you know we see we
45:52 see charlatans
45:53 and I I wish I could call my good friend
45:58 but my friend Jed over on his sees Jed
46:01 skeptics is his channel he did a episode
46:04 on charlatans and it was beautiful he
46:06 just got the definition out of a
46:08 charlatan put that on the screen and he
46:10 just went through a bunch of different
46:12 folks that have lied to us over the
46:14 years and it was a just a brilliant
46:16 episode I absolutely loved it so we have
46:19 people to this day who are scam artists
46:22 and and they look at life and I think
46:25 they say a lot of them have pre-existing
46:28 careers before they became charlatans
46:30 they worked hard like all of us and then
46:31 they realized that they're getting tired
46:34 I wouldn't it be nice to have a simple
46:36 way to make money and I saw this
46:38 documentary online about a gentleman in
46:42 the Philippines who has created a little
46:44 group you might call him a cult I don't
46:47 know what really takes it over the
46:50 threshold of calling it a cult but he
46:52 tells people that he is the heir of the
46:57 monarchy of the Philippines and in their
47:00 world they have two families over there
47:02 in their lore that ran the entire world
47:04 and that from them spawn all the other
47:07 races and when we spawn out of their
47:10 race
47:10 we corrupted the world it's very
47:14 interesting because if you look at the
47:15 world you can find good people in the
47:17 jungle who believe in all the wonderful
47:19 things that probably got intended for
47:21 this planet and then you go to the first
47:23 world countries with all this you know
47:25 sophistication quote unquote and you
47:29 know that's where you have corrupt
47:30 banking and a bunch of other horrible
47:32 stuff that happens so you can see how
47:35 easy it is to believe that story but
47:38 then he said that he possesses this
47:40 gigantic multi trillion-dollar
47:43 quadrillion dollar cache of gold and
47:48 treasure and in his cult what he tells
47:50 you is you join his cult you bring all
47:53 your bills with you and he will
47:55 underwrite the loans that you have and
47:58 then he'll forgive the loan on his in so
48:00 he adopts your loan with his
48:02 certificates which are claimed to be all
48:05 fraudulent and forged with his you know
48:08 stack of cash he's got like a gold and
48:13 then he absolved you of all your debt
48:15 it's a beautiful idea it really is if
48:19 there was a guy like that how awesome
48:20 would that be if the pay sewers came out
48:22 and said yes we have a 1.3 quadrillion
48:25 dollar trust in America and so what
48:29 we're gonna do is we're going to
48:30 underwrite everyone's loans on their
48:32 cars on their homes college loans
48:34 country loans we're gonna get everyone
48:37 out of debt and reset the entire world
48:38 and so some people have moved from the
48:41 first world countries to the Philippines
48:43 and they work in his camp now when you
48:46 watch the documentary what you'll end up
48:49 discovering is that and again who knows
48:51 what's true but he has quite a few sort
48:54 of muscle men who go into these banks
48:57 and they literally stand over the bank
48:59 president who's in this little tiny you
49:02 know cinderblock building and they
49:06 threaten the president to turn over the
49:09 loans and
49:10 rid of them and so he's I think he's
49:12 been successful getting rid of some of
49:13 the loans simply over through
49:15 intimidation like a Suge Knight sort of
49:16 thing so to get to some sort of
49:20 conclusion with this episode as it
49:23 relates to the moon missions let me make
49:27 you hip on for those of you don't write
49:30 one of the things we do if you're going
49:33 to write a movie there there's something
49:36 called the controlling idea and for
49:38 those of you haven't seen my episode 7
49:40 on screenwriting you should go see it if
49:42 you have a little story to tell if you
49:44 ever thought you could dabble in writing
49:46 I'll get you on the right course and
49:49 I'll get you to the right teacher which
49:51 you can access for about $20 if you just
49:56 get his book on tape called story by
49:58 Robert McKee MC k ee but if you were to
50:02 write the story like if you're a novice
50:04 writer and you haven't done this before
50:05 and someone says ok you are the writer
50:10 who wrote star wars and someone were to
50:13 say okay what's your controlling idea
50:15 for Star Wars you might say rescue
50:19 Princess Leia destroy the Death Star so
50:21 I'm very specific inside the script to
50:25 kill the rebel force or whatever I mean
50:29 or sorry kill the imperial force your
50:32 real theme and your controlling idea is
50:35 essentially light always is victorious
50:39 over dark good versus evil that's that's
50:42 your theme and of course you're gonna
50:44 have a uptick with what the Greek
50:47 theater would call a comedy ending which
50:48 means your protagonist defeats his
50:51 antagonist okay so what is our theme for
50:57 our daily existence pushing things like
51:00 the moon hoax into the common knowledge
51:03 of at least Americans now again the
51:07 beautiful thing is is that the younger
51:08 people I would say 40 and below and they
51:11 got no problem believing this is a hoax
51:13 and that's good because of the upcoming
51:15 generation there is this frivolous
51:18 attempt by the government and NASA to
51:21 save their 60 million dollars the
51:23 which again is like 22 billion a year or
51:26 60 million dollars a day 22 billion a
51:27 year just inside NASA I don't think that
51:30 accounts for GPL and all the SpaceX and
51:32 other ancillary budgets that are out
51:34 there but what we want is something that
51:38 could be likened to the thing I often
51:40 told you guys is that when you are
51:42 encased in a frequency that is not your
51:45 frequency it will become your frequency
51:47 there have been a lot of you that have
51:49 moved from the Midwest to a big city and
51:52 a rural area to a populated area let's
51:56 just make it easier and a specific thing
51:58 based on my background and you will go
52:01 from wholesome people that believe in
52:03 telling the truth and you know everybody
52:05 in the town so you couldn't possibly
52:06 lied because your parents are gonna find
52:08 out and you get your ass kicked at home
52:11 ostracized from your little town because
52:13 you're one of those guys that calls wolf
52:15 and you just might be a jerk of some
52:17 sort so you behave once you get to the
52:20 big city you realize man I never even
52:21 see people twice you can go to a copy
52:25 shop the same coffee shop every single
52:27 day in LA and as long as you vary the
52:28 time by five minutes you may never see
52:31 the purse same person in mine so you can
52:33 be a jerk
52:34 also there's stuff one of the reasons
52:37 why I think we push the truth narratives
52:40 in general it's one because it feels
52:41 good finally we're not living in a
52:43 stress ball cancerous life full of lies
52:46 we feel like we're doing something good
52:48 for society and in all levels of
52:51 Medicine politics and war just just
52:56 cleaning out all the crap that's being
52:58 sold to us constantly when you go to a
53:01 lake and let's say you've had a really
53:05 you have a really intense job and you're
53:06 pretty stressed out or family is
53:08 stressing you out or your life is
53:10 stressing you out some way you go to a
53:12 place like Lake Havasu any Lake will do
53:15 and I don't think too many people swim
53:19 in ponds but you get to a basic size
53:22 lake you sink yourself up to your neck
53:25 in this lake and you just chill now pool
53:29 does the same thing that a lake is even
53:30 better because it's bigger the water has
53:33 a frequency of calmness and peace
53:36 it is truth by any definition because it
53:40 simply is sort of like the universe sort
53:46 of like God and you sit in there and you
53:50 will feel your stress melt away you will
53:53 fill it and feel it melt away like all
53:55 the scenes and all those crime shows or
53:57 crime movies where some guy has just
54:00 lost his [ __ ] mind and he's got a gun
54:02 towards somebody's head his own head
54:04 he's got it pointed out the bad guy or
54:06 the good guy excuse me and someone
54:08 manages to say the magic words to give
54:11 them perspective of this temporary
54:13 insanity that they're in and they reach
54:16 over slowly and they pull the gun out of
54:18 the person's hand or the person gives it
54:21 to them and we all feel better that huge
54:24 amazing pressures lifted off of our
54:26 chest and believe me we construct those
54:29 intentionally and every script that has
54:31 that kind of narrative right we are
54:34 trying to peel the gun of Lies out of
54:38 everyone's hand to a much more simple
54:41 peaceful beautiful life you want to go
54:45 the moon there's nothing wrong with that
54:47 let's go but let's really do it this
54:50 time
54:50 let's have transparency on how much
54:53 technology we've been able to develop
54:55 how we're developing that let's track it
54:58 let's prove it that's what we're really
55:02 trying to do it's not trying to tell
55:05 your neighbor that they're stupid
55:07 there's no real satisfaction in that is
55:09 there nobody wants to be living next to
55:12 someone who's capable of believing
55:15 anything that they're told because jeez
55:17 how do you think all the Inquisition's
55:19 ever occurred in life I think all the
55:22 crazy wars have ever happened in life
55:24 someone programs from the top down to
55:27 all their people that those people over
55:29 there are so inferior they deserve to be
55:32 eliminated not educated but eliminated
55:36 simply because they're different like I
55:38 said several times in many episodes we
55:42 know that the world isn't on the same
55:44 playing field we know they're not we
55:48 have
55:49 in Africa and wild undiscovered tribes
55:52 and cliques inside of jungles of South
55:56 America
55:57 we even have folks that are trying to be
55:59 first world from third world and F when
56:01 we look at the way that they construct
56:03 things and build things they don't have
56:06 any standards they have no polish they
56:08 don't create anything they just copy
56:10 things okay so they need education too
56:12 so they can get up to whatever level of
56:14 they want to be at and because they've
56:18 already clearly announced to the world
56:20 they want to be at first world levels
56:22 they want to be leaders in technology
56:24 instead of copiers of Technology well
56:26 then there you go there's the Charter
56:28 that they have told you that they want
56:30 to be at this higher level but even with
56:32 in some countries they're so gigantic
56:34 they have people that don't want that
56:35 they just want to grow whatever
56:37 indigenous vegetable or whatever fruit
56:41 they want to make things because they're
56:43 notorious for creating high quality
56:45 items
56:46 but it's only that item everything else
56:48 is you know a hundred years if not two
56:52 thousand years in the past if a tribe in
56:54 Africa is completely happy with being
56:56 who they are then we just let them be
56:58 who they are
56:59 we don't need to change them they're
57:01 happy they know no other way they're not
57:04 hurting anybody not hurting themselves
57:05 and you go there and they're smiles on
57:08 their face and they just love seeing you
57:10 we want to make sure that no one's
57:12 malnutritioned so they're dying off but
57:15 as long as we're not responsible for
57:17 their malnutrition then they're in
57:20 charge of their world if they eat up all
57:22 their local food and there's no more
57:23 food left then maybe that's their sign
57:25 from God you've had a good run but you
57:28 you're a little late and so this last
57:31 generation is going to be the last one
57:33 that exists just the way it is it's like
57:37 the it's like the prime directive on
57:39 earth sarch the Star Trek wouldn't allow
57:42 after next generations to them to go
57:43 down to planets and interfere even if
57:45 everyone will planet was dying but not
57:47 to intervene about to change the course
57:49 of history well for us we know we want
57:53 truth we know that we have been lied to
57:56 in so many categories of life that we're
58:00 tired and we're suffering now as
58:02 result of these lies now national debt
58:05 is a complete facade it's a complete
58:07 bunch of [ __ ]
58:08 it's made up it's literally a bunch of
58:12 numbers in a computer that make people
58:14 feel I don't know stressed out oh my god
58:17 have you heard the national debt of the
58:18 United States national debt of the EU
58:20 Britain whatever hey it's all fake it's
58:25 all money borrowed from a loan shark and
58:28 it's all fake so wouldn't it be nice to
58:31 reveal that untruth I think it would
58:36 what I like about the moon hoax being
58:38 the tool being a tool to reveal the
58:42 truth is that it's something in the past
58:45 now again these agencies still exist we
58:47 are always aware of those facts and all
58:49 this other stuff but what's nice is
58:51 we've got an Achilles heel inside this
58:54 perpetual lie machine that we can use
58:58 infinitely to dismantle this apparatus
59:03 that is now spending millions probably
59:05 to fight the problem this year's going
59:08 to be a hefty year until after the 50th
59:11 anniversary is over now again as I
59:16 always say on this show
59:17 pretend like you're in charge of their
59:19 hoax you're you're in charge of getting
59:23 rid of dissent and so I'm not exactly
59:29 sure how the five eyes get involved with
59:32 this kind of stuff I mean why why does
59:34 Google cares so much about undoing those
59:39 that are trying to reveal the truth
59:40 stifling us shadow banning us putting
59:43 you know Encyclopedia Brittanica
59:46 articles under all the videos that they
59:48 have a concern that you'll change your
59:50 opinion from the hoax to truth that is
59:55 not a force that is for mankind that is
59:57 a force that is being evil against
59:59 mankind why can't they just let it be
60:02 how many of you have seen little kids go
60:05 take martial arts this was a big deal in
60:09 my hometown you have little tiny kids
60:11 that are like 11 10 years old I got walk
60:14 in
60:15 it was Kimpo and I'd walk in and these
60:20 kids already had black belts and you're
60:23 like really how the [ __ ] is this kid
60:25 have a black belt he thinks that lets
60:28 say pauses his training he gets his
60:30 black buddies at the top and there's
60:31 degrees of black Bob let's say he's like
60:33 first degree black belt and then he
60:35 grows up
60:36 never takes another class then he gets
60:39 overconfident in some dispute somewhere
60:41 thinks he can defend himself walks down
60:44 a dark alley just asking for trouble
60:46 because he's a black belt in his mind
60:49 from 11 years old and he gets killed
60:54 clocked knocked out by some guy just
60:57 took boxing you know some dude just had
61:00 a bad neighborhood never took any
61:01 training whatsoever well that's sort of
61:04 what's happening to mankind by
61:07 perpetuating these lies that we've
61:09 accomplished all these things we haven't
61:10 accomplished we have this false sense of
61:13 security I mean I took a ton of stuff I
61:15 got all the way up to like the taking my
61:19 brown belt tests and then of course they
61:23 didn't want me to move up too fast
61:24 because they'd bleed me full of [ __ ] you
61:26 know bleed me of cash and so they just
61:30 kept delaying my test and delaying my
61:31 test I must have sat there six months
61:33 well with in my brown belt I probably
61:35 would have been second or third degree
61:36 blond but brown belt before I graduated
61:39 from high school but they just kept
61:40 [ __ ] with me and I quit because I was
61:42 like [ __ ] this I'm not giving you money
61:43 while your sons and your daughters and
61:46 your best [ __ ] friends are all black
61:47 belts because your wink-wink nudge-nudge
61:49 eating them through the system and I
61:51 couldn't get up to the system now again
61:53 as for the rumors that some other secret
61:56 blackops space program has made it to
61:59 the moon and da-da-da-da-da
62:01 okay if that's the case don't you think
62:04 we'd be back up there with a space
62:06 station with at least a rover that can
62:09 take pictures that look like the moon
62:10 again I have a hard time believing that
62:13 Chyna always brings back dirt moons
62:16 brown dirt moons with just ice caps
62:18 lying around on this dirt soil moon and
62:21 somehow none of the pictures that we see
62:25 from a telescope just go back to Alex
62:27 Jones thing with his big 12-inch reflec
62:29 telescope his backyard and he seeing a
62:32 pure white entity in space well where's
62:36 the brown he'll even Mars way back
62:39 before we started seeing the place it's
62:44 brown it's rusty I do think it's
62:48 interesting that supposedly Mars is a
62:50 big rust ball of just pure iron surface
62:53 and there's no place on earth that's
62:57 like that we don't have an iron desert
63:00 do we [ __ ] man is go ahead and scoop all
63:02 this [ __ ] up melt it down you have the
63:04 most pure astrological iron ever nope
63:08 that didn't happen supposedly happened
63:10 on the next rock out hmm
63:13 for those of you have conspiracies that
63:15 you follow that might be that that Mars
63:17 has a civilization and that we're
63:20 routinely visited by that civilization
63:22 and that it could be lush and green and
63:25 you know the old the old illustrations
63:28 of Mars through a telescope prior to
63:31 NASA taking over the program I don't
63:34 know how you have those images from
63:36 space that they took a long time ago
63:38 from these giant lens telescopes not
63:41 matching anything that we have from the
63:44 missions to Mars modern in modern day
63:47 times it's sort of like you know the
63:49 drunk goggles when you look at a girl
63:51 and she's totally beautiful because
63:52 you're a completely drunk in the next
63:53 morning she's coyote ugly you know it's
63:56 sort of what we've done with the space
63:59 programs again the best evidence that
64:02 that NASA's been anywhere is that when
64:05 you look at the moon Europa from Jupiter
64:08 and you do Neil Adams expanding Earth
64:10 theory on it all these highways
64:13 completely come together beautifully
64:15 once you do the reduction in size
64:17 algorithms that he does that is the best
64:20 evidence we've been out there it's hard
64:22 for me to reconcile the only thing I
64:24 would think would be someone inside NASA
64:26 was so absolutely brilliant they
64:27 realized that expanding earth is the way
64:29 it goes and so they created this
64:30 interesting surface with all these lines
64:33 everywhere it looks like looks like
64:35 chromosomes all over the surface of this
64:38 ice ball I think I've got the moon
64:41 correct I think I can safely speak for
64:44 every single person who is doubting the
64:48 moon missions or it's completely
64:49 convinced that they're fake as myself
64:52 that we do want to be there we do want
64:55 to find out what it is now for those of
64:56 you think it's not real well that would
64:58 be something that you'd want to find out
65:00 right you fly something towards this
65:02 this white Diskin space and you fly
65:05 right through it and all of a sudden you
65:07 look back and you can see the projector
65:08 coming out of you know some island in
65:09 the Atlantic all right well wouldn't you
65:12 want that evidence to do you want the
65:15 truth just like I want the truth I'm
65:17 making this episode because there's not
65:18 a lot of conversation around the
65:21 conversation and what's nice is I think
65:25 we're going to the second tier of
65:28 evidence as well because we've seen the
65:30 low-hanging fruit for so long we're now
65:33 having folks come in and report all
65:35 kinds of interesting things like I said
65:36 I believe I said in the previous episode
65:38 we have an air conditioner expert come
65:41 in and he said look I've been known as
65:44 for 30-plus years if someone said I had
65:48 a room that was 250 degrees either
65:51 positive Fahrenheit or negative
65:53 Fahrenheit and I needed to cool that
65:56 down to 72 so human being felt
65:58 comfortable they weren't overheating and
65:59 they weren't going into hypothermia
66:01 he mentioned how much electricity with
66:04 modern-day technology with just big
66:06 giant furnaces or big giant air
66:08 conditioners it would take to accomplish
66:10 that effort and he's like there's no way
66:12 even he goes even if I had a little tiny
66:14 capsule in a room you know like a big
66:16 warehouse to build the capsule the limb
66:19 and you were to cool it off you had some
66:22 amazing lights that we're gonna heat it
66:24 up on one side to 251 that's somehow
66:27 able to cool it off and then you had to
66:30 keep you know tubes going up to this
66:32 environment so these these astronauts
66:34 are fine within a capsule
66:35 it'd be a tremendous amount of
66:37 electricity tremendous amount of
66:38 hardware and then when they hop out in
66:40 their suits they would have to somehow
66:43 miniaturize all that so a 100 pound
66:46 backpack and you simply wouldn't have
66:49 the battery power or the capability of
66:52 changing because you imagine the suit
66:56 has to any any air conditioning system
66:59 or cooling system or sorry our heating
67:01 system excuse me has to fight the
67:04 physics that are going on in the
67:06 environment that you're that you're
67:08 trying to correct for so what's
67:10 happening in negative 250 Fahrenheit you
67:12 have atoms that are not moving that much
67:15 they're not shaking that much in the Sun
67:17 you're having massive agitated atoms
67:19 moving the photoelectric properties of
67:23 the outside of your suit are going to be
67:25 incredible and so as an astronauts
67:30 moving from light to dark you're gonna
67:32 have this moment where the backpack is
67:34 going to have to do the opposite
67:36 instantaneously it's going to have to
67:38 have a photoelectric sensor on the
67:39 outside that goes your chest is in the
67:42 shadow so it's starting to cool off at
67:44 this alarming rate that's going to
67:46 freeze your body and you're gonna die
67:47 but your back is so [ __ ] hot that
67:50 you're gonna start boiling into the suit
67:52 you're gonna have first first degree
67:54 burn second degree burns and third
67:55 degree burns all within a split second
67:57 so how does one environment capture that
68:01 because again the outer surface of the
68:03 suit is going to be in polar opposite
68:05 temperature ranges so we're on to the
68:08 next batch of low-hanging fruit where
68:12 we're all looking at the evidence just
68:14 scratching our head going how do we ever
68:16 believe this and that goes for all the
68:18 equipment to the cameras the buggy all
68:21 this stuff I tapped once I heard the
68:24 comment online I tapped a good friend of
68:26 mine who has a tremendous amount of
68:27 experience in industrial manufacturing
68:31 and he has all the chemistry in his head
68:33 and he has all of the automation
68:36 capabilities so you would come to him to
68:39 say I want you to set up a factory that
68:40 makes you know ketchup bottles or
68:43 whatever he had never really
68:45 contemplated any of this stuff but once
68:46 he started in on it I showed him the
68:49 SpaceX car floating in space and he had
68:53 never seen that and he never really
68:54 contemplated this stuff and he's like
68:56 this thing is just floating out there I
68:59 said yeah because what did they did they
69:01 make it out of something special or is
69:03 this just a normal car
69:04 I said well Elon Musk said it was just a
69:06 roadster that he had that he just put
69:09 out there
69:09 and this guy picked it apart in 60
69:13 seconds I wish I'd had my notes to type
69:15 it all in but he picked it apart you
69:19 know we we all know that dashboards
69:20 crack in and was a scottsdale-arizona
69:24 when it's 115 120 outside and the inside
69:27 the car is 130 the dashboards just rip
69:29 open like wounds we know that when you
69:33 wash a car windshield in the summertime
69:36 and you just splash 65 degree water on a
69:39 windshield it's a hundred and twenty it
69:41 cracks it does it's expanding and
69:45 contracting he talked about aluminum
69:47 he's a Lumina Mex Burton he said you
69:49 need to understand that aluminum expands
69:51 and contracts at a far at the one of the
69:55 highest rates of expansion of all
69:57 Steel's and metals in the world you know
70:01 aluminum is aluminum it's not steel but
70:02 he says of all the materials it really
70:05 contracts and bends and so he's like
70:07 he's asking me what things are made out
70:09 of and so he picked everything apart so
70:15 were I think we're getting close to an
70:16 eclipse sort of event horizon to quote
70:20 the pseudoscience of the world to
70:24 getting the population converted to
70:28 truth and just like the lake of water
70:32 that is pulling everything back down to
70:36 a non-stressful environment for your
70:37 chest or for your heart when you're
70:39 sitting inside of a body of water you
70:41 know hot springs have been well known
70:44 for healing people and maybe just
70:46 because they have a stress inside them
70:48 some PTSD from their childhood or
70:50 something we're getting there we're
70:53 getting there and wouldn't you want to
70:54 live in a world where when someone tells
70:57 a lie it sticks out like a sore thumb
70:59 and you can see it and you can feel it
71:02 and instead of attacking that individual
71:04 because everyone else is in a truth
71:05 bubble we go in and we do psychotherapy
71:08 we figure out what's wrong with this
71:10 person's life we aid them out of their
71:14 disenfranchised state of mind we make it
71:18 okay to take the gun of religion
71:19 organized religion excuse me out of
71:21 there
71:22 they can keep all the beautiful parables
71:24 and metaphors of how to behave in the
71:27 morality of life intact but we simply
71:31 say look we tell our our kids the Santa
71:34 Claus story to make them behave every
71:37 time a parent says look if you don't
71:39 behave Santa Claus is watching you and
71:40 you're gonna get on the naughty list and
71:42 you're not gonna get any toys what
71:44 happens your kid starts behaving I've
71:45 seen it a hundred times with my own kid
71:47 and other kids it's a manipulation
71:50 mechanism to control them it also gives
71:53 them the sense of magic now
71:56 unfortunately the consumerism bubble at
71:58 the end but that's a lot about a lot of
72:01 the core themes of religion this sea of
72:06 fire and brimstone that is going to bake
72:10 the human flesh forever and ever and
72:12 ever for a finite amount of sins you're
72:14 gonna get an infinite punishment yeah
72:16 that's God's Way that's God's Way he's
72:19 so unfair all the time the truth isn't
72:22 scary most of the time now when we have
72:27 to expose the truth of evil yes that can
72:30 get kind of gut-wrenching sickening
72:33 nauseating but that's more of the reason
72:37 for those of us that are going to endure
72:39 the pain of reality of what people like
72:42 Jeffrey Epstein have done to children we
72:45 have to stop those people you know
72:48 there's been police officers many many
72:51 occasions have to break a crime bust a
72:54 crime where they're going into homes
72:55 where things have happened that are just
72:57 hard to digest as a human being because
73:00 they can't contemplate themselves ever
73:01 engaging in this behavior and so they
73:04 will resolve the crime and retire early
73:07 change their job they're like I can't
73:09 see this ever again that'll happen too
73:11 but the beautiful thing about the moon
73:13 hoax is it's not one of those things yes
73:16 Gus Grissom and his two buddies were
73:17 murdered on the tarmac in Apollo 1 they
73:22 works fixated or sorry they were given
73:24 cyanide gas they died and then they lit
73:27 the inner compartment on fire with this
73:30 little switch that was replaced and
73:32 that's why there's no struggle
73:34 no one's bodies we're trying to get the
73:36 hell out of the place as they were on
73:38 fire which would have been the case they
73:39 could have pulled a lever popped a
73:40 emergency hatch and gotten out of there
73:42 very quickly for those of you who race
73:46 cars if you know anything about the
73:49 flame retardant suits you can buy you
73:53 can buy suits that have 5 seconds worth
73:56 of flame retardant capability mean
73:58 you're completely on fire within 5
74:00 seconds if you can get to safety you
74:01 will suffer no burns and then you could
74:04 double your money and get a 10-second
74:05 suit and so that's a lot of time if I
74:11 sat here for 10 seconds saying nothing
74:12 you'd be like what's what's wrong you'd
74:14 be hitting your radio or whatever like
74:16 what's going on with this thing it's a
74:18 long amount of time to reach up and grab
74:19 a lever pull it and have you know T and
74:22 T bolts blow the door off and then all
74:24 the oxygen from outside comes inside
74:26 this pure oxygen environment ends and at
74:29 least you can do something but there's
74:31 no fuel for the fire there's no fire
74:33 anyway I think you feel me I just wanted
74:37 to lay this out there because again I
74:39 don't think the conversations happening
74:41 in public you might be happening in
74:42 smoke lounges around the world but we
74:44 need to start having the conversation
74:45 everywhere we go take away a bit of the
74:49 the penal the penal phase of the moon
74:53 hoax and really just get down to
74:55 revealing it first and we can deal with
74:56 whatever punishment you think people
74:58 deserve after that but without the truth
75:02 we we don't get the prize that we're
75:07 looking for you know someone commented
75:10 and I understand that they were like
75:11 because I had said in my episode of
75:16 smoking guns that again I don't think
75:18 that we should persecute the the
75:21 astronaut so I think we need to give
75:23 them immunity safeguard their pensions
75:26 maybe give a gigantic million-dollar
75:27 bonus to the first person that says the
75:29 truth and someone came in and said I
75:31 don't think that's the case I think they
75:33 need to go to jail and dot that that the
75:35 done alright well there's something
75:38 called the art of the deal if the if the
75:43 deal
75:44 is that we get the truth out of the moon
75:47 missions and we have to give immunity
75:49 away and some money away I would if I
75:53 mean Jesus if I was a millionaire can
75:55 give away that kind of cash I would
75:57 offer the first astronaut as much money
76:01 as I could afford to give away to that
76:03 astronaut to give a true sworn affidavit
76:08 that they didn't go to the moon let them
76:12 purge their soul before they go clean it
76:14 up repent there is an afterlife there is
76:19 a God I promise you I have seen versions
76:23 of it myself and there's countless
76:26 testimonies better than mine out there I
76:31 don't think there's again fire and
76:33 brimstone waiting for you regardless of
76:34 what sins you creates you've you facing
76:37 the rest of the souls of the universe
76:38 with your record up deeds is the hell
76:42 you create for yourself because it is a
76:44 permanent undeniable undeletable part of
76:49 your history it doesn't go away it's
76:51 your history if you were a leader that
76:55 killed millions of your own people or
76:57 other people that's your history enjoy
77:00 it because it's yours forever I'm saying
77:03 that fictitiously of course anyhow if
77:07 you have a bit of deep thoughts
77:07 radio.com please go you can change from
77:09 audio to video there's a lakh Facebook
77:11 group a Twitter page a patreon page
77:13 where I keep it short today take care of
77:16 yourself and someone else and I'll see
77:18 in the next deep thoughts over now
