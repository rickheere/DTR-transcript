00:00 [Music]
00:32 welcome back to the general on this nice
00:38 summer afternoon here it's about 75
00:42 degrees I got to thinkin about episodes
00:46 because men you guys have given me some
00:48 amazing ideas I am doing tons of
00:53 research and random areas based on your
00:55 recommendations to see if I can add
00:58 anything to the subject matter that you
01:01 guys you know picked out for me you know
01:05 again I have to bring something special
01:06 to it I can't just regurgitate what
01:09 other people say usually that's not
01:11 terribly hard to do because we all have
01:13 different brains this episode is about
01:17 something that I think plagues a lot of
01:19 us I've got an episode called calming
01:22 your soul which is kind of the precursor
01:25 to this episode but this one is about
01:26 stress how to identify it how to
01:31 perceive it and methods that you can use
01:34 very easily right away to kind of let it
01:38 melt off of you and it's going to need
01:41 some macro view concepts and some micro
01:45 view concepts right so you need to look
01:47 at it from a certain elevation and
01:50 understand where it comes from and I
01:53 think you need to understand down at the
01:56 meticulous level when you're putting
01:57 your head down at night and the world
01:59 seems a little bit smaller how to deal
02:02 with it how to process it right I have
02:05 always been a person who challenged
02:07 myself from a very young age and I think
02:11 life was challenging to me as well
02:13 and perhaps that's where kind of started
02:15 but I would be sitting in you know and
02:18 wherever the hell I lived as a kid and I
02:21 would purposely create a project it was
02:24 very stressful or at least really
02:27 complex and I pushed through it you know
02:31 I bite off too much constantly I'd say
02:34 well they would expect me to be able to
02:36 make this much stuff at this age screw
02:39 that I'm going to do four times as much
02:41 you know if it was hey my reading level
02:44 should be at this you know infantile
02:47 stage because that's how you know
02:49 dumbing down America works I would go
02:51 off and grab an encyclopedia some sort
02:54 of research book and read at it like
02:56 nine years old I've always pushed I've
03:00 always pushed so your humble narrator is
03:03 perhaps a little different than most
03:05 people in terms of how I perceive stress
03:08 but the thing is is that there's two
03:11 ways to view stress if it's stressed
03:15 that you control it's much more friendly
03:18 to your being because you're the one
03:21 that made it happen right if it is
03:24 stretched this being imposed upon you
03:26 that can be very frustrating because you
03:29 have a sense that you don't control your
03:31 life and for whatever reason our
03:34 creators have programmed us to want to
03:37 have control over our lives it's the
03:39 most amazing thing that's why some parts
03:42 of society refused to endorse change
03:45 because they've just barely convinced
03:49 themselves that they actually have
03:50 control over the chaos that is their
03:52 world right if something comes around
03:55 and says oh no we're going to make it
03:56 all different it's way better they're
03:58 terrified because they don't understand
04:00 what the definition of better is they
04:01 don't even sure how the hell they got
04:02 where they are - to perceive the control
04:05 that they have right but when you well
04:10 when I was a kid let's just put this way
04:12 and as I grew up and grew up you know
04:13 and I was probably a kid until I liked
04:15 was in my 30s pushing myself into
04:19 project after project you know going
04:21 into companies and getting very senior
04:23 roles and having the whole
04:25 the whole product line on my back and my
04:27 you know mid to late-20s you know I
04:30 would at times I work for companies and
04:32 I would become the lead engineer or the
04:35 senior engineer and what we sold every
04:38 single six month period was something
04:40 and I would invent and it paid everyone
04:42 salaries you know everyone locally in
04:44 the United States and everybody over in
04:46 England you know based on engineering
04:49 that was going on internally by other
04:51 you know dozens of other people but when
04:53 it really became a product that was my
04:55 responsibility to conceive of it to
04:57 polish it to find the need like Steve
05:00 Jobs would do and then engineer the
05:02 final product together right with a
05:04 small team and so I always had stress
05:09 but I also had the excitement of the
05:12 responsibility and I could see the
05:16 outcome of what I was going to be
05:18 creating I could see the customers
05:20 because I always used the products that
05:23 I assist you know like it's one of these
05:25 things of whoever used some sort of
05:29 appliance in the kitchen and right away
05:31 you know that the people that assemble
05:33 it or the people that even designed it
05:36 don't use that type of appliance right
05:38 it might be a blender or something you
05:40 use a computer and you're like do you
05:42 even use a computer you know the windows
05:44 programmers it always baffled me that
05:47 they would create as many windows as
05:49 possible like you go into dialog ub8
05:51 dialogues need to change some little
05:53 property on a driver and you sit there
05:56 and you say how could those engineers
05:58 possibly think this was a good idea and
06:00 you think ah because they don't use
06:01 their own product and so when I would
06:05 push myself into a stressful situation
06:07 the stress meant something different to
06:10 me it was a kind of a warm room --is--
06:14 compression on my soul that said we're
06:16 doing this and this is going to be tough
06:18 but we're going to get it done there's a
06:20 certainty of that and we know that
06:22 people are going to love it because you
06:24 know you would love this to exist right
06:28 that's probably not the brand of stress
06:32 that you're terribly concerned about if
06:33 you're going to watch this episode the
06:35 kind of stress you're worried about is
06:38 the variables of life of which you do
06:40 not control changing outside of
06:44 parameters that you're willing to accept
06:45 right what does that mean you got a job
06:48 you got an income you don't mind the job
06:51 maybe even love the job if you hate the
06:54 job but you got to take it you got to do
06:57 the work and you get your money and you
06:59 come home and you pay for your
07:02 obligations your mortgage your car loan
07:04 the electricity your cell phone your
07:07 children your spouse and then something
07:11 happens in the stock market something
07:13 happens in the global banking cartel as
07:15 fueled by the sixteenth Amendment United
07:17 States of America which pretty much
07:19 [ __ ] the entire world and they're
07:21 creating a boom sorry they're taking a
07:24 boom cycle to a bus cycle you have no
07:27 control over this right other than to
07:29 vote these [ __ ] out of office and
07:31 redo some basic monetary constitutional
07:36 amendments but that's a long haul right
07:39 in the immediate present now someone is
07:45 playing with your life they're playing
07:48 with your financial certainty a
07:49 variables being altered a variable that
07:52 is a part of the direct equation for you
07:55 to feel comfortable every single time
07:56 you wake up in the morning put on your
07:59 clothes go to work work leave come home
08:02 and try to enjoy your evening before you
08:05 go back to bed again if you come home
08:08 like most people you wake up like most
08:10 people you're reading some news and the
08:12 news is telling you that it's about to
08:15 hit the fan and you're like wow how
08:17 could it possibly be good you know going
08:18 to beating the fan when everything's
08:20 fine right now and we won't jump off
08:23 into the specifics of how that happens
08:25 but in the end when a variable gets
08:27 changed that threatens your livelihood
08:29 that's where stress starts to occur and
08:33 stress is the byproduct of uncertainty
08:36 in most cases you're stressed because
08:39 you don't know the outcome of an event
08:42 but you either need that event to turn
08:45 out the way it needs to turn out or you
08:47 want it to turn out perhaps it's an
08:50 opportunity of a lifetime
08:52 and you know that you want to be a part
08:55 of that unique opportunity you know that
08:57 you're willing to do whatever it takes
08:59 to be a part of that opportunity work 20
09:02 hours a day you'll do it but the problem
09:05 is you don't control the variables
09:07 perhaps you don't even control the
09:08 opportunity to participate even though
09:10 you know deep down in your heart you're
09:12 you are the person they need to succeed
09:15 what I want to highlight here is that I
09:18 think that there are obviously different
09:21 cycles in history where what I'm saying
09:24 applies and doesn't apply let's just
09:26 take the last hundred years I would say
09:29 that if you were to go into my hometown
09:31 in 1965 and say have you ever heard of a
09:37 homeless person the best they could do
09:39 was talk about the hobos out of the 30s
09:42 the guys that just jumped trains
09:44 constantly went from city to city which
09:47 obviously I think that would have been a
09:49 blast just you know it's only going to
09:50 last maybe a decade tops if you jumped
09:52 on a train in 1930 but I don't think it
09:54 started until probably about 34 okay you
09:57 know you wait for the war to come around
09:58 you enlist you get scooped up off the
10:00 street and you go become useful and then
10:02 you've just blend right back into
10:03 society but some of these guys were in
10:05 their third or sorry their 50s 60s and
10:07 70s hobos because that's all I could do
10:10 America didn't want to employ him
10:12 anymore
10:12 the trade skills weren't so great the
10:15 revolution of industrial design made
10:18 things you know outside their reach you
10:22 know to assemble a car was way more
10:23 complicated than it was 20 years earlier
10:25 but the reason why I mentioned this
10:27 little cyclical thing is because I want
10:28 to put into context what I'm saying
10:30 today we fear things that society didn't
10:34 fear 50 60 years ago and in my opinion a
10:38 hobo chose to be a hobo in a lot of
10:41 cases they're right they're written
10:44 songs about it they've written books
10:45 about it just get into it
10:47 there's a whole revered lifestyle in
10:50 that level of freedom because the world
10:54 was plentiful and this population wasn't
10:56 overdone there was always a loaf of
10:57 bread here a pying and up a windowsill
10:59 they're Mia probably stole a few of the
11:02 the goods they needed but I think people
11:05 could find good people and the whole
11:07 world was suffering right but today it's
11:10 much more surgical isn't it the world is
11:14 much more populated regardless if you
11:17 could see this being overpopulated or
11:19 not it's really dense now traffic in Los
11:20 Angeles is sometimes inconceivably dense
11:25 you know you'll be traveling in
11:27 timeframes in LA where everyone should
11:30 be at work and that it's packed it's
11:35 fact it's jammed and you're like why
11:36 doesn't everyone have a job right but we
11:40 have developed and this is the point of
11:44 me going off on this digression we have
11:47 developed society to a point we've
11:50 invented all of these constructs all of
11:52 these things that are perceived as once
11:55 or needs that didn't exist 60 70 100
12:00 hundred 50 years ago but now they're an
12:03 interwoven part of our daily model the
12:08 things that we need and society quite
12:10 frankly has impressed upon you things
12:12 that you need who has a home phone
12:15 hooked up to their house raise your hand
12:19 not much right not many folks have home
12:22 phones everyone has a cell phone well
12:25 home phones were damn near free I mean
12:27 I'm serious you what did you pay 15
12:30 bucks a month $25 a month but you did
12:33 have long-distance calls
12:34 you know charges and all that stuff back
12:36 in the day but now everyone owns a cell
12:38 phone the cell phones range from what
12:41 you know you know we only usually pay a
12:43 few bucks down but every single month
12:45 that we pay this huge feat we're paying
12:46 for the phone we're paying for the
12:47 service phones are like between $600 to
12:51 Apple's new iPhone 8 which is going to
12:53 be like 1200 bucks for the top model
12:55 insane so they've convinced us to ditch
12:59 this old technology and replaced it with
13:00 extremely expensive technology and now
13:03 if you were to reduce your life to the
13:06 bare minimum essentials of life you have
13:08 to have a cell phone
13:09 we've now allowed existence tax to be
13:11 passed to United States of America which
13:13 is called health care the Obamacare
13:15 thing
13:16 okay so I'm sure there's a bunch of
13:19 welfare things you could get involved in
13:21 but just think about it when you start
13:22 to reduce yourself into a situation
13:24 where you might be in a cyclone of
13:27 destruction for a really short period of
13:29 time you're going into a valley and not
13:31 a peak life is going to get hard for
13:33 whatever reason your bare essentials
13:36 your strategic resources that you think
13:37 you need and that you may actually need
13:39 it's way bigger now that picnic basket
13:43 you know it's really huge as opposed to
13:46 what it used to be but this is something
13:48 that I want to highlight because we
13:51 intellectualize our needs in this world
13:53 there are homeless people all over the
13:55 beach here in Southern California they
13:58 barely have a pot to piss in
13:59 you know they carry around all of their
14:02 wares in summertime their winter wares
14:04 and summertime now we do get some pretty
14:06 cold nights still but they're going to
14:09 be carrying around their winter stuff
14:11 and for fall they don't have to go find
14:13 it again some of the guys shed it but
14:16 most of them have pretty intense
14:19 clothing so you can see individuals that
14:22 have reduced themselves down as their
14:23 primal feral state of this is all I need
14:26 to really stay alive so I can wake up
14:28 tomorrow I got their water a little bit
14:31 of food on them just provisions to stay
14:34 warm now let's think about I'm going to
14:37 come that career here for a second
14:39 because it's it's more linear it's the
14:42 first thing you run into after you get
14:44 out of school is your career and I want
14:49 to highlight the fact that there are
14:51 things about your career that are
14:55 perhaps necessities and there are things
14:57 that are perhaps just the things that
14:59 you believe that you really really want
15:01 for yourself and I am entirely guilty of
15:04 all this which is why I'm an expert so
15:07 what's the imperative when it comes to
15:08 your career well the imperative is that
15:10 you get a job and you earn enough money
15:12 to pay your bills your strategic
15:15 resource bills right your food your
15:17 shelter your water all that good stuff
15:19 clothes on your back all that good stuff
15:20 right the next tier up is your personal
15:25 almost persona desires for yourself
15:29 you've been asked since you were a child
15:32 what do you want to be when you grow up
15:33 and you kept answering the question when
15:36 I was a kid it was extremely simple the
15:38 whole [ __ ] world is going to be
15:39 overpopulated with nurses and firemen I
15:41 don't even know I mean I guess the
15:43 nurses would be the only people that
15:44 could start a fire because all the men
15:46 would be in fire houses but there is
15:48 that extra layer on top which is you
15:50 want to do what the hell you want to do
15:52 now unfortunately like I've mentioned
15:55 several times on the show the kids of
15:56 today grew up with no hobbies and so
15:58 they hit 18 I have no idea what they
16:01 want to do they don't have any parents
16:02 in their lives to help them pay
16:04 attention to what they actually enjoy
16:05 doing in their teenage years other than
16:08 you know look at a cell phone and so
16:11 they get degrees and crap that they have
16:13 no interest in then they spend you know
16:15 however many years bumbling around
16:17 careers they don't like either they end
16:19 up taking the career enforcing some
16:22 Stockholm Syndrome love for the career
16:25 or they break free and they succeed and
16:28 changing everything and figuring out the
16:31 themes of which they enjoy in life and
16:33 going after that right but there is this
16:36 layer on top of most of us which says
16:39 that we want to get a job that has a
16:42 couple properties to it one we don't
16:47 want to be embarrassed telling other
16:48 people what the hell we do it's sort of
16:51 a pop culture thing of course right - we
16:54 want to have fun with our job we want a
16:57 job that's so great that when we wake up
16:59 we love it we bounce out of bed in the
17:02 morning right I'm pretty sure Steven
17:06 Spielberg bounced out of bed for the
17:08 majority of his life once he started
17:10 making film because he loved film he
17:13 loved the art he loved the finished
17:15 product and so he worked tirelessly to
17:18 create his first 20 years worth of films
17:21 well is succeeding really easy print
17:25 said something in baby I'm a star is
17:27 Larry so he said when you got a baby
17:30 nothing comes too hard I'm going to tell
17:33 you right now that that is probably the
17:35 most wise statement you could hear in
17:37 terms of getting your destiny and this
17:39 war
17:40 and when he's talking about is well you
17:42 know when you got it that little tiny
17:45 collection of words means when you have
17:48 the skills that you need to do what you
17:51 need to do and you know let's be clear
17:53 you don't start off you know danny
17:56 elfman 2017 in terms of being a musician
17:59 unless you be a a lien dropped off with
18:02 amazing musical ability even danny
18:05 elfman turned out you know at the very
18:06 beginning bouncing into his own ego
18:08 Bongo band way back in the 70s late 60s
18:10 he fumbled around he just played junk
18:14 and eventually he played great music
18:16 you know motley crue talked about
18:18 sitting inside of a garage and playing
18:20 crap for ages and ages the beatles write
18:22 what they wrote what nearly fifty songs
18:24 before they wrote a single song anybody
18:27 wanted a year but they screwed up fifty
18:29 times but they showed the universe my
18:32 creativity commitment here they show the
18:34 universe that they're willing to invest
18:36 and they're willing to push hard and
18:38 here comes the universe going boom okay
18:40 well we have tons of music for you guys
18:42 we just need the artist to commit in
18:45 front of us so that we can give it to
18:46 you and sadly some bands eat themselves
18:50 alive right but we still get the gems
18:53 right so stress that i think in its most
18:56 fundamental definition as to factors it
18:59 is your perception of having a lack of
19:03 control in your life again every single
19:06 thing you do every single day is a bunch
19:08 of variables that are executing that are
19:10 like like code that's executing right
19:12 when you double-click Microsoft Word you
19:14 know a lot of things are happening
19:15 inside the brains of the computer to
19:17 bring that application up every time you
19:19 touch the keyboard a bunch of
19:21 calculations are happening to move that
19:22 data into the into the bowels of the
19:25 computer so you can see it on the screen
19:27 that's every moment of your life and so
19:30 the second part of it is I mean that's
19:33 just the that's the mathematical part
19:35 but the psychological part is that you
19:37 believe that something needs to happen
19:38 now again you know that you understand
19:42 the fundamentals of life that certain
19:44 things definitely need to happen right
19:46 you need to be able to eat drink sleep
19:48 and that kind of stuff
19:52 but I want you to try in your mind to
19:54 separate as hard as it might be the
19:57 difference between your wants and your
19:58 needs there's a really interesting thing
20:01 that happens in life
20:02 when you have a near-death experience
20:05 when you have a near-death experience
20:07 the universe sort of gives you a chance
20:09 to reassess yourself and I've never
20:12 known it to be I'm sure this has
20:15 happened but I've not known someone to
20:16 go down to death bounce back and not
20:20 have a completely different view of life
20:22 you know I got a business partner of
20:25 mine who just died at his Country Club
20:28 was resuscitated with a defibrillator I
20:33 had to have two pops on the
20:34 defibrillator woke him up
20:36 you had no idea what happened and he
20:39 eventually had you know some heart
20:41 surgery and cleaned them all up and and
20:43 today he says I have more clarity than
20:46 I've ever had he goes everything is just
20:49 simpler cleaner and he goes I'm just
20:53 happy to be here man
20:54 he's a brilliant brilliant man and I can
20:58 tell having known him for several months
21:00 before this occurred to him and knowing
21:03 him now he is happier his life is
21:08 simplified it never really was that
21:10 complicated but the one thing that
21:11 happened was you know I just mentioned
21:14 there's two things we want to keep in
21:15 mind there's the calculation of sort of
21:18 the core things that have to happen in
21:20 this world
21:20 and then there's which is like your
21:22 strategic resources that you need and
21:24 then there's the psychological layer of
21:25 what you think you care about that's on
21:27 top of that he had a clarification when
21:32 he finally got through all of his
21:34 surgeries and all this good stuff and he
21:35 turned out fantastic super healthy now
21:38 you know he's going to be healthier for
21:40 the rest of his life than he was before
21:42 this moment which is fantastic he
21:45 realizes he has all the strategic
21:47 resources he does and he's adjusted the
21:51 layer above that to simplify itself what
21:54 do you need I don't need that much it
21:56 was really what he's found out as much
21:59 as we are completely different human
22:00 beings we might believe you know there's
22:04 there's a larger group of you that
22:05 believe the world is
22:06 a ball there's a large group of you that
22:08 believe it's flat there's a large group
22:10 of people that believe that Jesus Christ
22:11 really existed there's a large group of
22:13 us that don't think eat existed okay but
22:17 in the end those are intellectual
22:20 privileges that we get because a bunch
22:23 of people fought Wars and not that we
22:25 should have been able to sort of needed
22:27 to fight wars to get to where we are but
22:29 we fought and we divided up our land and
22:31 then we beat we sing Kumbaya and held
22:34 hands in most cases and now we have the
22:36 freedom to think to see the world and
22:40 appreciate the nuances of it right I
22:43 assure you that the number one thing
22:45 that you want to be able to do is wake
22:47 up in the morning that's the number one
22:49 thing from that point it is gravy
22:53 now again I'm not pounding rocks in some
22:55 North Korean prison so I don't mean to
22:59 include the extremes of life but for the
23:01 majority of the world even those that
23:04 get paid two dollars and 20 cents a day
23:06 in China to build iPhones it's better
23:08 than a lot of alternatives that we've
23:11 seen in history but let's talk about
23:13 your perception of reality without
23:17 stress and your perception of reality
23:19 with stress now most of you understand
23:23 that when you look straight ahead let's
23:25 say you sit in a chair and you look
23:26 straight if you're driving your car and
23:28 listening to me on podcast just think
23:29 about the fact you're paying attention
23:30 to the traffic in front of you and if
23:33 you're sitting at your desk or whatever
23:34 just pay attention to your eyeballs you
23:37 have massive peripheral vision your
23:40 peripheral vision is more than 90
23:42 degrees to the left the center and more
23:44 than 90 degrees to the right of Center
23:45 on average it's a hundred degrees left
23:49 so ten degrees back behind the line that
23:52 goes perpendicular out from your ears
23:55 you can see a ton of the world with
23:58 these eyeballs which is actually utterly
24:00 fascinating if you look at the shape of
24:02 the lens the shape of our eyes that it
24:05 can catch so much light almost behind
24:06 our head right so now I want you to keep
24:11 that in mind and then I want you to
24:13 think about your you wearing blinders
24:16 and blinders are those things they put
24:18 on horses
24:19 to get rid of their peripheral vision
24:20 you've seen them in old movies where
24:23 they have these little like mud flaps
24:25 that are hanging on the left and right
24:27 side of the horse's head that was to
24:29 keep them focused in going straight
24:31 they found that putting these blinders
24:33 on horses make them much easier to
24:37 travel within a city because they didn't
24:39 get spooked by things to the left and
24:41 right which might be merging with them
24:43 coming at them etc okay how does this
24:46 apply to stress I want you to understand
24:50 that you have a set of eyes that also
24:52 are duplicitous when it comes to viewing
24:55 the world according to your stress
24:57 levels okay when you are not stressed
25:01 when you are informed that you won the
25:03 lottery and it's a four hundred million
25:05 dollar lottery what is happening is you
25:08 get maximum peripheral vision of the
25:12 world all of the beautiful things the
25:15 world has to offer sound sight smell all
25:17 the five senses plus some some spiritual
25:20 just relaxation in the sixth sense you
25:25 have maximum view you can sit on a beach
25:28 in Hawaii and get it you can see that
25:31 gods of Kamehameha up there just forging
25:35 those islands with his bare hands right
25:38 but when you're stressed the blinders
25:42 come in and they're not fixed it's not
25:45 like you just have 100% blinders
25:48 depending on your stress level your
25:50 peripheral vision the angle of view
25:52 starts to come in and come in and come
25:55 in and you can see less and less of the
25:57 world which means you can appreciate
25:59 less and less of the world this is a big
26:03 deal because it affects your ability to
26:05 mathematically be happy and your ability
26:08 to be alive when you are stressed you
26:14 are late if you so say you're super
26:17 stressed and you are laser-focused those
26:19 blinders allow you to see you know maybe
26:22 12 inches of view right in front of your
26:24 face it's like wearing one of those
26:26 horrible VR headsets right you have to
26:28 look for the action all the time right
26:30 same thing
26:32 but you tend to laser focus on the
26:35 things that are driving you crazy
26:36 you try to laser focus on earning money
26:39 if you have money problems you tended
26:41 laser laser focus on every interaction
26:43 with a certain person if you feel like
26:45 you are in a relationship that's going
26:49 bad and this is where we may or may not
26:56 be losing control now what could happen
26:59 is life gets good now how many of you
27:01 have had this happen to you okay life
27:03 gets good when life wasn't good
27:06 you were thin you were fit you weren't
27:10 exactly mentally fit but you're
27:13 physically fit you spent your money
27:16 wisely because you didn't have much of
27:18 it and then you got fat and happy made a
27:24 bunch of money and you just look at your
27:25 photographs I've had this happen to me
27:27 look at the photographs you like wow I
27:28 just gained a pound I gained a pound I
27:29 get a pound you know I got to a point
27:31 where I found myself in 2012 probably
27:36 weighing 25 pounds too much I've talked
27:39 about this several times so it won't be
27:40 labored but the idea was I got
27:42 unstressed I wasn't paying attention to
27:46 life I was enjoying the lack of stress
27:48 now when I look back on those
27:50 photographs I'm actually kind of pissed
27:52 off and the reason why is I would never
27:56 let a soul see these photographs of me
27:58 all fat right but those moments happened
28:01 so now I can only really keep the
28:03 collection photographs where I'm not in
28:05 them now that might be vain and there
28:08 might be whatever but for me I
28:10 considered it a personal failure that I
28:13 had given up on my body the only thing
28:16 I've got to sustain this particular
28:19 instance of my life and I had defamed it
28:24 I had not paid attention to it I think
28:27 we owe it to ourselves to covet
28:30 ourselves all right
28:32 protect ourselves everyone worked really
28:34 hard to build us to who we are all of
28:36 our relatives about all that stress they
28:40 boiled up to make you and you're an
28:42 amazing person and so
28:46 you own it for now right until you have
28:48 kids but you want to be you know I think
28:51 a good example for everyone everything
28:53 in this world but then you went through
28:56 a stressful moment whether it be a
28:58 positive stressful moment or not and you
29:00 get lean right and you know your money
29:02 goes down because you're investing it or
29:04 whatever you're doing maybe your kid
29:05 needs to go to college and you're
29:06 throwing the the cash at the University
29:09 or whatever but your lean your stress
29:11 level goes up a little bit maybe a lot
29:14 and now the sudden you're sort of like a
29:17 lean machine man you know it's like wow
29:19 you know when I wasn't in boot camp I
29:23 was unhealthy but when I went to boot
29:24 camp and had to have a guy smack a trash
29:26 can before I am to get up had to scrub a
29:28 toilet with the toothbrush had to be
29:31 literally sort of this indigenous Irvan
29:33 to the military yes much as I want to
29:35 complain about all that hard training
29:36 and then you're proud of it beyond your
29:40 wildest dreams right how many soldiers I
29:45 mean they're they're good soldiers out
29:47 there that really love what they do but
29:49 there's a lot of guys that went through
29:50 the military and we're freaked out and
29:52 scared and stressed out of their frickin
29:53 mind when they're done and they survived
29:55 the war I just some survived all their
29:58 tours and all the deployments and they
29:59 come back when they walk down the middle
30:02 of that street 3 times a year to be
30:05 celebrated as a soldier I hope that
30:10 their chest is bursting with pride that
30:12 they were able to get through it all and
30:15 dedicate themselves just remember our
30:18 police officers do it every day
30:21 so I mention this analogy of sort of
30:24 your stress peripheral vision because I
30:27 want you to understand what you're
30:28 missing by being stressed because I'm
30:31 going to try to go into some methods
30:32 here that I use to get around stress to
30:35 deal with stress to categorize it and
30:37 not let it kill me and I I think I'm
30:43 only capable of dealing with stress and
30:45 holding the clay of stress in my hand
30:47 because I understand where it's for
30:49 words to understand where it I
30:51 understand the do's and don'ts of what
30:53 you can do with it I understand its
30:56 importance to create the mother of
30:57 invention
30:59 to give an example of where stress can
31:02 make wonderful things happen and idelle
31:05 time you know I doubt that any of you
31:08 don't know this already but for those of
31:11 you who like the music of James Brown
31:14 which for any of you who like rap music
31:17 you have to love James Brown because he
31:19 gave them all the beats that they
31:20 started out with he talks about being in
31:26 the late 50s and getting to a point
31:29 where he had no trade skill that he
31:32 could find to to earn money and so he
31:37 started leading a band and he was
31:41 starting to make things a little saucy
31:42 er right the beats that he was putting
31:44 together were not beats that you know
31:46 you'd play in your local church because
31:47 they were more rock and roll II they're
31:49 more funk right he was inventing funk at
31:52 the time we have him in our world
31:55 because of stress financial stress got
32:01 him to think differently to survive and
32:05 he died a very successful man right but
32:09 now let's take the stress of perhaps
32:11 someone who's lost their cool because
32:14 they were stressed and he was definitely
32:17 accused of it from time to time how many
32:20 of you know the story of someone who is
32:22 who has been up to a particular point
32:24 just a model citizen a wonderful person
32:27 they all sudden have life change and
32:30 they become stressed and then they do
32:32 something you couldn't possibly conceive
32:34 of they get violent maybe they get
32:37 belligerent maybe they start doing a
32:40 drug alcohol or other drugs and they
32:44 cease to become the person those used to
32:47 remain the person that you've known them
32:49 as for those of you who go back to high
32:52 school reunions you know you'll have a
32:53 person who may have done this and they
32:56 come back to the reunion and sometimes
32:59 they physically look really different
33:00 because they've been under a lot of
33:02 stress all the American presidents
33:04 always going with usually some fairly
33:07 normal hair and they come out very grey
33:10 peppered and just
33:12 they look worn the reason why I mention
33:15 that is that I want you to see the cause
33:17 and effect model of sort of what stress
33:21 does to an individual most of you
33:23 already know this of course but
33:24 sometimes you have life behave for a
33:28 while it's good for a while and then
33:32 because it's been good for so long you
33:35 don't make provisions you don't save
33:37 money you don't look ahead and or even
33:42 study than now properly and then you
33:45 reach that point where you go back into
33:47 a valley which is a reminder of what not
33:51 to do now having lived a number of years
33:56 and lived a very intense life myself
33:58 there are some times I might welcome an
34:01 adjustment and other times I'm baking
34:04 Jesus I just lived high on the hog a
34:08 little too long and I'm going to be
34:12 missing out on some opportunities had I
34:13 paid attention that would have been mine
34:17 and I never get those years back right I
34:19 never get any previous year I've lived
34:21 back and the market the changes in the
34:24 world in terms of employment are
34:26 starting new companies
34:27 it changes enough that certain
34:29 opportunities come and they go because
34:31 other people were on their game at the
34:33 time right place right time right and
34:35 they take the opportunity and run with
34:37 it now the truth of the matter is is
34:39 just keep your eyes open because there's
34:41 infinite opportunities you just have to
34:43 start looking left and right instead of
34:45 straight ahead sometimes right get
34:47 unstressed so you can see more of
34:49 reality and you will see more
34:52 opportunity when you get super stressed
34:55 you get a rational right because if you
34:58 think about your peripheral vision
34:59 analogy that I just gave you the idea is
35:02 these are your senses this is your
35:04 information input right and when I sit
35:07 right here I'm seeing beautiful green
35:09 all the way around me with my house to
35:10 the right I'm taking in that information
35:13 if a bird lands in front of me I notice
35:16 like I have these butterflies to fly
35:17 around constantly while I'm doing the
35:18 show wasps catching the wood off my
35:22 table out here to make best
35:24 I watch them while I do the show it's
35:27 information but if I sat here and put
35:30 the camera right in front of me
35:31 and put the blinders on you and I are
35:33 just looking eyeball to eyeball one it
35:34 would be very strange but two I wouldn't
35:37 notice what's going on and the
35:38 opportunity to see something amazing is
35:41 now us reduce because the aperture of
35:43 which I see life is been tightened
35:46 considerably so when you think about
35:48 stress freaking you out and making it
35:50 all messed up this is the thing I don't
35:52 hear anyone talk about they talk about
35:53 how it's going to make you unhealthy
35:55 which we're going to get to as well so
35:58 let's talk about the health risk for a
35:59 second how many of you have dealt with a
36:01 piece of electronic equipment that gets
36:04 confused it's a maybe it's slightly more
36:08 complex it's a computer it's a sort of
36:11 DVD player or whatever you're dealing
36:13 with a television and it gets confused
36:15 you push the right number of buttons and
36:17 you found a bug and the computers in the
36:19 loop and it's like your TV could be
36:22 going through some weird loop your your
36:24 computer could be crashing but you can
36:26 still move the mouse and you know it's
36:27 in there in a loop somewhere thinking
36:29 and thinking and thinking well we're
36:32 exactly the same way when it comes to
36:34 stress your body
36:38 although utterly brilliant is still just
36:41 your vessel it is the symbiotic
36:45 recipient of your soul I'm just going
36:48 with that because that's what I believe
36:49 on this show you could insert feedback
36:52 loops into your life for stress you know
36:56 you ever had the situation where you're
36:58 you're just laying your head down to
37:00 your pillow at night now man it's good
37:02 it's a good day man the rooms of right
37:03 temperature the sheets are all clean
37:05 it's really awesome
37:06 you got your love on with you and it's
37:08 you know your jackknife and each other
37:09 and it's awesome and then you remember
37:15 oh my god I don't have my car registered
37:18 I got that bill you know this happened
37:21 this happen and you had this piercing
37:23 cloud of stress hit your chest and it
37:28 just changes the state of mind you are
37:30 just about to not often have one of the
37:32 best dreams of your life and all of a
37:35 sudden you're wide awake worried about
37:38 some piece of
37:39 worried about some gigantic monopoly
37:42 corporation getting your money worried
37:45 about your car getting repo'd everybody
37:47 getting kicked out of your house over
37:48 and over and over right that could only
37:52 happen because you care about being
37:55 perhaps accountable and you don't want
37:59 to get to a point where you don't care
38:00 because people will show up at your
38:02 doorstep every once in a while depending
38:03 on what you're neglecting as I've said
38:06 several times on the show before how
38:08 many times have you worried about paying
38:09 a bill and you've done this your whole
38:13 life
38:13 since you started paying bills you have
38:15 that chilling piercing cloud of ice in
38:18 your chest it makes your whole body
38:20 tense up and because you're worried
38:21 about something and the damn thing gets
38:23 paid every single time even if it's late
38:26 even if you got to charge off your
38:28 credit cards or whatever the hell it is
38:29 it always resolves and you always end up
38:32 on your feet but in the mean time you
38:35 sort of have this deteriorating penalty
38:39 in your health because you allow it to
38:42 consume you as I said several times on
38:45 the show the concept rinse space in your
38:47 mind it's got a little sublease inside
38:50 your head that it lives and it can just
38:52 torture you this is where we have to
38:55 very carefully okay I say this with a
38:58 caution very carefully figure out
39:01 whether or not you actually have to care
39:03 or whether or not sitting in your bed at
39:05 night is going to do anything to make
39:07 things better now believe me understand
39:11 this is an easier said than done thing
39:12 and it's frustrating as hell but you
39:14 can't just say well look I'm in bed the
39:17 best thing I can do to pay my bills
39:18 tomorrow is to get a good night's sleep
39:20 today so really the best thing I can do
39:22 is just go to bed and feel warm and
39:25 fuzzy that I'm going to wake up tomorrow
39:26 just bright-eyed bushy-tailed I'm going
39:28 to go after the world and get things
39:30 paid off or do whatever the hell is you
39:32 got to do but it's never that easy is it
39:35 as a footnote to that whole concept of
39:38 worrying about bills and worrying about
39:40 demise most of us have a friend that's
39:44 gone through a lot of [ __ ] in life
39:47 they've lost their cars they've lost
39:49 their homes they lost things but a lot
39:51 of them don't quite get to that
39:52 terminal level of actual massive change
39:54 but they've got those they haven't been
39:56 able to pay and somehow they always end
39:58 up on their feet and you have no problem
40:00 walking up to them hearing about their
40:02 distress and encouraging that things are
40:05 going to be okay just hunker down and
40:06 get things done but when it comes for us
40:08 to take that same advice for our own
40:10 problems we tend to be less
40:14 compassionate or less in belief that our
40:17 own device works but I'm going to tell
40:20 you the secret is is that our advice
40:22 does work we just need to take it every
40:24 once in a while now in terms of health
40:27 what happens is this any feedback loop
40:30 of stress starts to get the body really
40:34 confused because you in order to have an
40:36 emotion have to use up electricity to
40:40 make it happen how many times have you
40:43 gone into a masseuse it gives you like a
40:45 full body massage you had some spa
40:48 you're at some vacation you're on a
40:50 cruise whatever and it's just a really
40:51 good when you have someone really just
40:53 rush you up the way you like it
40:54 you went in all stressed out but when
40:56 you came out you almost feel like a
40:58 zombie you feel clean you feel like the
41:01 Meridian lines of you know your veins
41:03 and your arteries that carry electricity
41:04 around you know you feel like you've
41:08 been reborn in one way or another and
41:10 you say on the way out god I got to do
41:12 this more often you're not wrong you do
41:16 we all need to have one of these once a
41:18 week I mean seriously if you want
41:20 everyone to be really healthy in the
41:21 world if if we just had clinics that
41:24 just did this and you can get them in
41:27 here in Huntington Beach with you know
41:29 pull your clothes on do amazing jobs but
41:34 that clears you out the big deal about
41:37 stress in your life and this is why
41:41 lying is really bad for you okay is that
41:45 you start confusing all of your DNA's
41:48 and natural growth patterns you start
41:50 introducing electrical patterns that
41:52 aren't the electrical patterns of
41:53 sustaining healthy life and as de la
41:57 Marck figured out way before Darwin
41:59 created his very primitive botched
42:01 Darwinism the French scientist de la
42:04 Marck
42:05 had figured out that we are electrical
42:08 beings in the de quality and the overall
42:13 path of the electricity that makes up
42:14 our day-to-day second to second life is
42:17 what determines our health the membrane
42:20 of all your cells are the brainiacs of
42:22 your cell not the nucleus okay if you
42:25 want every more about that read all
42:26 Bruce Lipton's books but when you send a
42:29 cell a really confused on sensical
42:33 reaction to a thought that you've had
42:35 which is now only able to be conceived
42:38 of in your mind because your
42:39 intellectualizing it into existence
42:41 right cavemen never thought about you
42:44 know the [ __ ] 9/11 tax on your cell
42:47 phone bill that just pisses you off
42:49 right he never thought about that he
42:51 just woke up kind of shook it off there
42:54 was no whistle that he had to go to work
42:56 and punch a clock you knew he needed to
42:59 hunt if they're running out of food they
43:00 needed to get some crops or whatever
43:03 worked out in the granary but we have
43:05 created all this stress so when cells do
43:09 not get clean information and clean
43:11 electricity what do you think happens to
43:14 him right what happens to him what
43:18 happens when you put anything other than
43:20 gasoline in your car put some water in
43:24 there and see what happens put some
43:26 sugar in there and see what happens with
43:28 some sawdust in there and see what
43:29 happens you'll ruin your car because
43:34 it's not gasoline there's something
43:38 called the law of particulates when you
43:40 breathe anything other than pure oxygen
43:41 you're not doing your cells any health
43:44 because you're reducing the amount of
43:46 metabolized oxygen in your blood supply
43:50 that's why we got to get planes out of
43:52 the sky that leave white [ __ ] clouds
43:54 in the sky right so I turn on a little
43:56 bit wearing there's no saying is you
44:00 know what happens to liars they get
44:02 cancer and they die and I first heard
44:06 that I thought wow that is the most
44:08 silly thing I've ever heard of my life
44:09 and that was my opinion probably 25
44:11 years ago and today I will tell you that
44:13 that is a mantra to live by but a lot of
44:17 people misunderstand the quality of that
44:19 statement lying would be going out and
44:22 telling a bunch of people untruths right
44:24 mmm yeah sure that'll do it that'll do
44:27 it now little white lies here and there
44:29 because you play Santa Claus at the mall
44:31 probably a little bit different because
44:33 your soul gets redeemed by the beauty of
44:35 the child believing in this fictitious
44:37 thing but how many of us wake up every
44:40 day and we have a few lives that we tell
44:42 ourselves every day I look great when
44:45 you don't I don't need to work today
44:48 when you do all those little micro
44:52 fractures in the fabric of who you are
44:54 as a person if they are deceitful
44:58 there's a bunch of stuff that happens
45:00 here when you live in truth you feel
45:04 redeemed constantly the the feeling of
45:06 truth going through your body is a cool
45:09 reinforcing almost Holy Spirit sort of
45:12 thing it is as if God Himself is going
45:14 through your system on you know a
45:17 routine basis you're the light bulb and
45:19 God is the is the electron cloud that
45:22 goes through you to turn you on and you
45:24 feel alive and bright and on when you're
45:28 in truth when you tell a lie there's a
45:31 couple things that happen here
45:32 one you're having to obviously be
45:36 convinced that you can't tell the truth
45:37 so that's an acidic emotion in your
45:39 system if you want to slow down time
45:41 right
45:41 it's an acidic emotion that makes you
45:43 want to deceive to survive because
45:45 usually lies are a matter of
45:47 self-preservation and almost every
45:48 single scenario now some people are real
45:52 bastards and they lie to just get ahead
45:54 when they don't need it because they're
45:55 greedy but whatever they still feel the
45:58 same thing I'm telling you I don't
46:00 really think there are too many people
46:01 that feel warm and fuzzy about lying
46:03 then they have to construct the line so
46:06 they have this emotion now they got to
46:07 use their brain to be deceitful and some
46:09 of them can get adrenaline and dopamine
46:10 running because they're like wow look
46:12 how creative I am in telling a lie
46:13 that's going to get me what I don't
46:15 deserve the next stage is they have to
46:18 remember the lie they have to categorize
46:19 the lie and every time their brain
46:22 approaches this particular subject
46:23 matter in conversation they have a
46:26 veneer over that moment which is the
46:30 deceitful cloud of what sour
46:33 not happening or what actually didn't
46:35 happen a chronic liar typically has to
46:38 rehearse the lies over and over and over
46:41 again to the point they get really good
46:42 at telling them where the muscle memory
46:43 inside their mind is so worked out that
46:48 they start to lose track of what reality
46:50 is you know give you an example if AJ
46:54 Simpson killed Ron Goldman and his wife
46:58 he is sitting in prison and sitting at
47:02 home whenever every day from the moment
47:04 he did that till today rehearsing how he
47:06 didn't do it so that's the when he gets
47:10 confronted with it his entire demeanor
47:14 passes it passes the test that we would
47:18 put on it we look at his face we look
47:20 for muscle tics and he touches here did
47:23 he blink a lot did he hyperventilate he
47:25 needs to be at a point where he can
47:27 absolutely recall where he was which is
47:29 perhaps maybe where he wasn't and passed
47:31 the test so he has to remember it the
47:37 other thing is usually tell a lie to one
47:39 person and then if that person tells
47:41 someone else hey this guy said he went
47:43 to the moon well now you're going to get
47:45 perhaps you know you felt like you could
47:48 lie to the person that had 110 IQ but
47:51 they tell a bunch of people with 180 IQs
47:53 and now you got a problem because these
47:55 other guys are going to come in and go
47:56 all right mr. Armstrong lunch you sit
47:59 down and we're going to ask you some
48:01 scientific questions of which will
48:04 determine whether or not you really win
48:05 or none and as you contradict yourself
48:07 or your fellow astronauts will know
48:09 someone is lying and that you didn't go
48:11 which is what happened but now think
48:14 about it you work really hard to tell a
48:17 really great lie all right now you have
48:22 all this due diligence you have to do
48:24 constantly right you have to polish the
48:27 lie over and over and over in your mind
48:28 you have to remember it every single
48:30 time you go by that's why Buzz Aldrin
48:31 screwing up now that's why you said on
48:34 Arizona
48:35 you know nightly news you know once we
48:37 figured out how to get to the moon will
48:39 be a lot easier to get to Mars he's
48:42 losing the faculties in his brain to
48:43 hang on to
48:45 this stressful frequency of the lie I
48:49 can only hope that at least one of them
48:51 before they die says you know I don't
48:56 give a [ __ ] anymore take my pension
48:58 whatever I'm going to tell the truth by
49:02 the way I miss quoted that Michael
49:04 Collins had passed away in Ojai it's a
49:06 different guy that died in Ojai one of
49:08 the astronauts he died on the just
49:10 before the 40th anniversary he's the guy
49:12 that actually said that he was going to
49:14 blow the whistle why so I I got that
49:16 wrong but what do you do if you find
49:19 yourself just let's just do a little
49:21 digression online I'm probably gonna do
49:23 an entire episode on this even though I
49:27 talk about it constantly
49:28 what do you do if you got yourself in a
49:30 situation where you have sort of a glove
49:34 compartment of lies that you've told the
49:37 damages have been done or there can't be
49:41 any more damage as a result of those
49:43 lies there so in the past okay they're
49:45 bringing them out can just do harm and
49:47 it's not going to benefit anyone well
49:51 you're not supposed to say on shows like
49:54 this just keep them in the glove
49:56 compartment and don't worry about them
49:57 but that's what I'm going to tell you to
49:58 do because if you're up my smoke lounge
50:01 with you know five of the wisest men you
50:04 could possibly bump into that's the
50:06 advice that we give you but they would
50:07 also look you in the eye and say you
50:09 [ __ ] up and creating those lives in
50:11 that glove compartment okay so what you
50:14 want to do is take the glove compartment
50:15 and turn it into a symbol of the do and
50:18 don't rule of the world and don't do it
50:21 again it is going to be the reason is
50:24 you're going to carry to your grave that
50:26 you don't want to tell any more lies
50:27 because remember the glove compartment
50:29 remember the skeletons that are in there
50:32 now the truth the matter is you might
50:34 find yourself capable of telling
50:35 strangers about what's in the glove
50:37 compartment and at least you kind of got
50:38 it off your chest
50:39 probably one of the wisest thing the
50:41 Catholic Church ever did was create
50:42 confession because at least you could
50:45 tell someone who listened to you you
50:47 could build a rapport with that person
50:48 you know priests were psychologists
50:51 that's what they were they gave you
50:54 prayers you could go home and sing which
50:56 weren't in the Bible but it made you
50:57 feel better you paid attrition
50:59 you repented for what you did at least
51:01 you said sorry to everybody but the
51:02 people that you lied to but maybe maybe
51:06 it makes you more steadfast and behaving
51:08 much better to them for the rest of your
51:10 life with them now let me give you some
51:13 sort of thought processes to hopefully
51:17 help you D intellectualize yourself a
51:20 little bit to perhaps reduce the
51:24 significance of certain things in your
51:26 life and I'm going to give you I'm going
51:29 to give you very specific things but I
51:31 want you to do is not only listen to
51:33 this very specific example but I want
51:35 you to think about it as a theme over
51:37 other similar things in your life such
51:42 that you can get more mileage out of
51:44 this example all right they say that
51:49 ignorant of the law is no excuse if you
51:53 break the law and you go to court and
51:55 you say jeez I didn't know that was a
51:56 lot there's a lot of guys that get
51:59 caught urinating out in the back of
52:03 public places you know they're in an
52:05 alleyway no one can really see them but
52:07 if they get caught they become a sexual
52:08 predator or sexual offender and they go
52:11 on these lists which they don't deserve
52:13 to be on but they go to court and they
52:15 say my god I didn't know you couldn't
52:16 pee in public and I will I Beverly
52:18 didn't know I probably knew you couldn't
52:19 be imposed but I had no idea the
52:21 consequences were going to put me in a
52:23 camp with a bunch of pedophiles and they
52:26 say well you know mister whatever you
52:28 know ignorance of law okay two things
52:32 here what human being on earth knows all
52:37 the laws in the world is it possible to
52:41 know all the laws in the world do we
52:42 have the mental capacity besides perhaps
52:45 the advancement that true autism gives
52:47 an individual to know all of the laws in
52:51 the world every ordinance every federal
52:54 law state law district law whatever the
52:57 answer is hell no it's impossible for
53:00 the average human being even advanced
53:03 human beings to know all the laws it's
53:04 impossible you'd have to go to school
53:06 for 20 years to remotely have a chance
53:09 and oh by the way laws get retired new
53:12 laws get added
53:13 how could you possibly read all the
53:15 material in a lifetime there's too many
53:19 words to read so their assertion is a
53:21 physical impossibility that will put you
53:24 in jail the tax code in the United
53:28 States of America at least is impossible
53:31 to learn there is no CPA on planet earth
53:35 that knows all the tax codes there's
53:38 some that know quite a bit you know I
53:39 helped invent the product TurboTax back
53:42 in the day we called Mac in tax I sat in
53:45 rooms of some of the most brilliant CPAs
53:47 in the world you had hot red phones
53:49 directly into the IRS to talk to their
53:51 top dogs and on average the IRS called
53:54 our guy to figure out how particular
53:56 disputes were going to be resolved in
53:58 the tax law because our guy was smarter
54:01 okay so if you're stressed about things
54:06 like this there has to be some rational
54:11 reduction in that process by saying it's
54:15 just impossible to do certain things
54:16 that the sort of matter-of-fact
54:19 absolutes and pose on humanity now those
54:23 are two gigantic ones right and I'm not
54:24 saying you turn into a vigilante or some
54:26 anarchist and you run in court and say
54:29 oh I saw dogs I said there's no way you
54:31 could understand all the laws you know
54:33 common laws the only one you need do no
54:35 harm to others and then everything falls
54:39 into place that's really the only law
54:41 that you need to do and when they bring
54:42 into court they go did you understand
54:44 common law did you understand you're not
54:46 supposed to hurt anyone else and you
54:48 can't say no you say yeah I know well
54:51 what did you think you can't harm
54:54 yourself you can't harm others so you
54:56 took all those drugs and racked up your
54:58 body and then you went in and stole a
54:59 lot of stuff and you killed the guy or
55:00 whatever and you're like on your third
55:02 violation for the day that's why common
55:06 law is so beautiful but think about the
55:09 tax laws the tax laws are imposed on you
55:12 illegally in this country especially for
55:15 your wages at least the one thing fake
55:17 news will never cover there's starting
55:20 to leak out again and again getting
55:24 control over your life is the key
55:26 - really wrangling stress one of the
55:32 things that drives people crazy is
55:34 whether or not they're ever going to be
55:35 able to change the life that they're in
55:37 and I'm going to tell you in 99.9% of
55:41 the cases you always change your life
55:43 you can you can completely change it it
55:45 just takes a little while longer than
55:47 you want it to but I have known friends
55:50 of mine male and female who've had you
55:53 know the horrible awakening in their 40s
55:56 that that life is changing their
55:58 employment opportunities are different
55:59 because they're older they work in
56:01 younger industries right I worked in the
56:03 game industry the video game industry
56:04 since I was 19 years old well in my 40s
56:08 now there's not a lot of companies that
56:10 will snap at my resume regardless of how
56:13 massively packed it is because in their
56:16 brain they don't have time to bring
56:17 everyone in who's a maybe when they
56:19 think they've got resumes that are
56:21 certainties and so they keep creating
56:24 these really immature games that keep
56:26 repeating history because the kids that
56:28 are so young they don't have any history
56:29 in their mind and so they're creating
56:31 crap and so these companies are going
56:33 down the tubes because they thumb their
56:35 nose at the Masters of the industry a
56:38 few companies are smart enough to hang
56:41 on to them and that's why they're very
56:42 very successful but there's only so long
56:45 you're going to fight sort of the in
56:48 justices of the world as you might
56:49 classify them right I don't try to go
56:53 back into the video game industry and
56:54 the way that I was in it before because
56:59 I know that they don't understand what's
57:01 going on and if they did they'll find me
57:03 you know we'll find each other through
57:06 some some happenstance situation so what
57:10 I do now is I lecture at colleges about
57:13 the neural chemistry of creating games
57:15 because I'm at that level where I
57:17 understand how dopamine and testosterone
57:19 contribute to the overall gaming
57:21 experience I've studied literally the
57:24 millisecond picosecond you know dumping
57:28 of these chemicals to figure out how you
57:30 can design a game - beautifully marry
57:32 the actual biological flow of the brain
57:34 to have the best experience Nintendo's
57:37 one of the only companies in the world
57:38 that remotely studies this kind of thing
57:40 people at Nintendo wear lab coats you
57:43 know that because they consider what
57:45 they do to be a science they will study
57:48 the neurological patterns of a human
57:50 being for ten years a little tiny
57:52 experiment experimental rooms and then
57:55 they'll make a choice inside Zelda to
57:58 monopolize on something they figured out
58:00 but you go to any Activision subsidiary
58:03 any act any EA success subsidiary and
58:06 you know there's none of that
58:10 and so they repeat history over and over
58:13 and over again but what I did to get out
58:17 of that sort of frustration bubble of
58:20 going geez you know I'm not the peak of
58:22 my skillset you know I think every day
58:23 is your peak quite frankly if you if you
58:26 stay on something but here I'm at the
58:28 peak of my skill set I'm teaching
58:30 students at two different colleges how
58:32 to go into the industry and succeed but
58:35 whatever reason it's hard to convince
58:37 the industry that you're still a value
58:39 which is interesting so I contribute
58:41 from the bottom in but I've decided to
58:43 take my skill set go off to a different
58:45 industry that will benefit gaming
58:48 tremendously and I don't have to worry
58:50 about how the games are created I don't
58:51 have to make the next best game on
58:53 planet Earth
58:54 I just can take that game and move it
58:56 into my industry and hopefully make some
58:59 some people really happy and maybe a
59:01 little money along the way right but
59:05 that's me thinking dynamically about the
59:06 restrictions that I have instead of
59:08 wallowing in pity and that kind of stuff
59:10 and saying whoa was me I'm being
59:12 extremely aggressive about it in doing
59:16 so though like I mentioned at the
59:18 beginning of the episode I have created
59:19 a situation that is very stressful it
59:22 has a lot of risk to it that consumes a
59:25 lot of money to get started and make it
59:27 happen but every day I just focus I just
59:31 focus you know if what I have to deal
59:33 with work-related issues I personally
59:35 put the blinders on not out of stress
59:38 but out of the need to focus right
59:42 there's a great book out there I want to
59:44 recommend to all of you and it's called
59:45 that one thing it's a tiny little book
59:48 get it on audio if you drive in your
59:50 cars
59:51 but I want you to get this book if
59:53 you're
59:54 stress if you or if you just want
59:55 control over your life a little bit more
59:57 or if you're trying to advance the
59:59 agenda in your life and succeed I'm
60:01 telling you the younger that you are the
60:02 more you need to read this book this
60:04 book should be given to freaking
60:06 fifteen-year-old and you should have to
60:08 read it every single year until you stop
60:11 going to school and you should have to
60:13 tell someone else about the book from
60:14 start to finish such that you will know
60:18 it like the back your hand it becomes
60:19 your mantra but the books focus is focus
60:22 you need to pick one thing and focus on
60:25 it until you exhaust it it's not a sin
60:29 to change your mind at all that's fine
60:31 but at least if you do change your mind
60:34 you'll be such an informed decision on
60:36 your part that you'll go on to another
60:40 equally impressive thing a lot of times
60:43 for instance the analogy would be you
60:47 need to get on the roof of your house or
60:48 a roof there's two ladders up against
60:52 this building and perhaps the first
60:54 ladder goes to the first roof and the
60:56 second letter goes to the second roof I
60:58 don't know how this house would work but
61:00 let's just keep that analogy in our head
61:01 so you're crawling up the letter and
61:03 it's scary right ladders aren't exactly
61:05 the most warm fuzzy things especially if
61:07 you're using your home letter right the
61:10 Sun way at some point you're 3/4 the way
61:12 up and you're stressed beyond your
61:15 wildest dreams it doesn't look like this
61:16 is where you're really supposed to be
61:17 you started to analyze you stopped
61:19 climbing for a second you start looking
61:21 around going oh my god the place I
61:22 really need to be as a second roof not
61:24 this first roof nothing wrong with the
61:26 first roof but I really might my goal is
61:28 up there a little higher and so as
61:31 stressful as it might be you have to
61:33 either climb down the first letter get
61:35 on the second letter climb up or if
61:36 you're capable which is obvious is more
61:40 often not the case you need to transfer
61:42 to the other ladder right and midstream
61:45 which just picture that in your head
61:47 you'll probably feel a little stressed
61:49 once you get on that ladder though the
61:51 one that's right for you every step gets
61:54 that much easier because now you know
61:56 you were on the wrong ladder and now
61:58 you're on the right letter and you're
61:59 climbing up to the destiny or the or the
62:01 milestone that you need to get finished
62:03 to get to the final thing or maybe it is
62:05 the final thing right
62:07 I would suggest in that metaphor that
62:09 every step is a milestone but now
62:11 there's a little saying in life but is
62:16 extremely cliche and you know the sad
62:20 part about cliches is that you're tired
62:23 of hearing them but in the end they're
62:25 true most the time and the cliche is
62:28 nothing risked nothing gained and let me
62:32 tell you that is that is a huge fabric
62:36 in the world and I'm going to give you a
62:39 bigger version of that that I hopefully
62:42 will sit with you a little deeper in
62:44 your soul then nothing risk nothing
62:48 gained this is how I've been living my
62:51 life for probably the last two years and
62:53 it's a result of doing this show this
62:55 hearing my own voice
62:55 talk talk talk which you know it's not
62:57 exactly that pleasant I made a decision
63:00 and doing all these probably in the
63:03 episode of creating the universe my own
63:08 private thinking after the episode I
63:09 thought well you know what's interesting
63:10 is I keep trying to figure out what's
63:13 the benefit of us being in existence at
63:16 all if we have a creator fine it's a god
63:19 it's an alien it's an alien that reports
63:20 to a god or whatever doesn't matter pick
63:23 your poison only an atheist could blow
63:25 this off which is does the universe
63:30 really need another trivial human being
63:32 to exist you know wake up you know now
63:38 you're born you believe in a bunch of
63:39 magic you kind of straighten yourself
63:41 out to get some education you get a job
63:43 you get married you have kids you have
63:44 grandkids and then you die there's a lot
63:48 of wonderful things we all know that
63:49 happened in these moments just looking
63:51 into a young child's eyes is enough to
63:54 understand a big portion of the universe
63:57 but there is a little Avenue for you
64:00 personally there's a personal
64:02 accomplishment track that you're on as
64:05 an individual and the idea is do you
64:08 want to end your life sort of a cliche
64:12 could be pure truth could be pure good
64:14 could be very great but I keep thinking
64:18 you know why do skills exist
64:21 why do talents exist right talents or
64:24 skills you find very early in life and
64:26 metabolize up at an early age
64:27 that's all the same [ __ ] you got to work
64:29 your ass off to get there I have chosen
64:34 personally to say the universe doesn't
64:37 want me to be trivial I must push the
64:41 envelope
64:42 I must risk at the total peril of my
64:45 future or present I must strive to be
64:51 something universes rarely seen I should
64:54 say I don't think we can ever probably
64:55 say never seen but rarely seen this is
65:00 one thing I have with the frustration of
65:02 the lifespan of a human being as society
65:04 is currently designed just about the
65:06 time you get your [ __ ] together you lose
65:08 your eyesight and you start getting old
65:09 right but I'll tell you what I hang out
65:12 with guys my business partners at range
65:16 and my associates of my mentors there
65:19 from 57 to 83 that's their ages and
65:24 what's interesting about that is that
65:27 you can get a tremendous amount of
65:28 mentorship just listening and not saying
65:31 anything just listen and observe and try
65:35 to figure out how they got to their
65:36 level of success now you may not take
65:38 anything about them but one little
65:40 element of their behavior may think
65:42 they're a total jerk but you can still
65:43 distill out of them beautiful things
65:46 that you can apply to yourself and do
65:47 correct right I said a long time ago you
65:50 know every other manager I had in life
65:51 before I became a manager and start
65:53 running my own companies was a jerk
65:56 whoever all the others every other one
66:00 was a most amazing human being I've ever
66:02 met in my life and they oddly were
66:06 exactly what I needed at that point in
66:08 my life to get to the next level like I
66:09 had an intellectual capacity to
66:11 understand spoken word and they were
66:13 there meeting me I - I they could read
66:16 me they could figure out what I could
66:17 understand what I couldn't understand
66:19 they needed they understood what I
66:20 needed to hear as encouragement and they
66:23 needed to they knew what I needed to
66:25 hear
66:25 in terms of stop bitching and moaning
66:27 and just get get down to business yeah
66:30 you're going to have to stay up two days
66:31 in a row tough [ __ ]
66:33 that's what greatness is made out of now
66:36 I have an episode on time management
66:37 which doesn't get listened to because I
66:39 think people misinterpret what they're
66:40 going to hear but if you haven't heard
66:42 it and you're interested in this
66:43 particular episode it's about how I
66:45 manage my day to day time it's a real
66:49 personal kind of walkthrough with a
66:51 bunch of generic lessons in there but
66:52 you know I don't waste a second of my
66:55 life to my according to my standards
67:00 right if I take a nap in the middlee
67:02 afternoon for half an hour because I'm
67:04 totally exhausted I think that's exactly
67:05 what I need at that moment to recharge
67:07 to wake back up and do what I need to do
67:10 you know because we have so many
67:13 portable devices I can take portable
67:14 devices with me to the restroom and I
67:16 don't waste any time there you know I
67:18 hate to break your bubble but when I'm
67:20 replying to you guys on YouTube and
67:22 doing little Facebook posts and things
67:24 half the time I'm in the restroom
67:26 because that's when I got the time to do
67:29 it the reason why I mentioned that
67:31 little digression is that stress can be
67:33 invented out of things that you love and
67:35 so there is definitely a stress that
67:38 comes with perhaps those of you who lift
67:41 weights you understand your stress in
67:42 your body and you don't always want to
67:45 lift weights every single day you don't
67:46 want to go running whatever whatever
67:48 your endeavor is but when you get done
67:50 damn it you're like why didn't why don't
67:53 I do this every single day because it
67:54 makes me feel amazing that the human
67:56 body loves being stressed physically
67:58 right for those of you who are let's
68:02 just put this way male-female doesn't
68:04 matter you turn on the TV you watch a
68:06 movie you you live in a nice area like
68:08 Southern California and you see these
68:09 amazingly fit people that are your age
68:12 if not older and they look amazing
68:13 they're physically fit we have all the
68:17 muscles that you want all the body tone
68:19 that you want and a lot of times you'll
68:21 feel stressed looking at a Mick as
68:23 you're like Jesus how often is that guy
68:25 I get to go to the gym I don't have that
68:27 kind of time to go to the gym but there
68:30 are ways I have to sit watch IRA sit
68:33 down and record this episode I have an
68:36 audio file over there got a video file
68:38 up here I bring it into Final Cut in my
68:40 office I sync them up I cut down all of
68:42 the pauses and then I have to burn the
68:45 playhead back to the beginning and I
68:46 push play and I
68:47 have to listen to my voice for an hour
68:49 and a half an hour it's excruciating
68:51 trust me and I have my weights in the
68:55 office with me one of my techniques is
68:58 say I'm stuck I'm a captive of my own
69:00 creation but to push these episodes out
69:02 I got to sit and watch so sometimes I'll
69:04 get into Photoshop and work on a project
69:05 I will do something artistic work and
69:08 listen at the same exact time or I'll
69:10 just lift weights and you can't I can't
69:11 lift weights for an hour and a half for
69:12 God's sakes
69:13 but I go off and do 15 minutes here sit
69:16 down I feel amazing all that credible
69:18 testosterone and all that stuff jumping
69:20 into my system and I'll do a little bit
69:21 of something on the side and then I
69:23 might go back and do another 15 minute
69:25 session I might continue to three or
69:26 four times during an episode in the end
69:29 when I go to bed at night and I take all
69:31 my clothes off I look in the mirror I'm
69:32 like Jesus I love the way that looks I
69:34 love it so I start reinforcing in my
69:38 brain but Tony Robbins technique but the
69:41 pain where it needs to be and put the
69:43 positivity where it needs to be and
69:45 stress can be inside both those buckets
69:47 and not always be acidic to your system
69:50 what else does stress do to us well
69:53 stress creates situations where we do
69:55 things to mellow out chemically you know
70:00 my confession is cigars that you do not
70:04 inhale by the way our devices of which
70:07 you know it
70:08 we don't inhale them down to our lung so
70:10 we don't include our lungs too bad
70:11 because they're not made of paper and
70:13 chemicals and insulation from your
70:16 ceiling cigarettes we just get a little
70:20 bit of blood sugar level displacement
70:23 from the tobacco that goes into our
70:24 saliva in our mouth right but what else
70:27 do people do they drink they come home
70:30 and they say I need this and they pour
70:33 themselves to drink but there'd be a
70:35 little bit alcohol or a lot of alcohol
70:37 doesn't matter their liver is getting
70:40 assassinated by the drink so people do
70:43 hardcore drugs
70:44 some people just smoke weed so these
70:50 apparatus can can give us a momentary
70:54 control over our life smooth this out
70:57 get rid of the stress levels and you
71:00 know what's interesting is
71:01 you study Sumerian text and even some
71:05 Egyptian texts but it's really hardcore
71:06 in the Sumerian tablets they wrote down
71:08 a lot of the recipes that they did for
71:10 healing people and I think the elements
71:12 back in those days were fairly trivial
71:14 compared to what we have today but at
71:16 the end of every single recipe or I
71:18 should say nearly ever recipe they would
71:20 say drink beer you know so these these
71:23 [ __ ] stories about monks inventing
71:25 fermented fruits is just insane beer and
71:28 alcohol spirits were all invented by
71:31 Nature you know when fruits hit the
71:33 ground and fermented over time in the
71:35 Sun and someone just picked it up and
71:36 ate it they got drunk and eventually
71:38 someone put the connection together
71:39 where you can actually incubate that and
71:41 distill it in a way that's drinkable you
71:46 want to see a hilarious video go go look
71:48 at the guy from the Aussie man he's got
71:50 this
71:51 he took a nature video where a bunch of
71:53 animals had eaten some fruits that had
71:56 fermented that were shaken down from
71:59 elephants and the LA does fermented
72:01 fruit you got monkeys and boars and
72:02 elephants and everyone's getting
72:04 shit-faced eating this stuff it's
72:05 hilarious right but you have to pick
72:09 your poison you have to pick the one
72:10 that's going to damage your body the
72:12 least to be very very careful can you
72:15 imagine getting your life together right
72:18 you've totally figured everything out
72:19 whatever age you are doesn't really
72:21 matter but you hit this euphoric sort of
72:24 mean in your life and then you die
72:28 because of the mechanism you use to get
72:30 there the drugs finally take over your
72:34 liver goes pop you get some other sort
72:37 of cancer some other brain damage or
72:39 something life is sort of a video game I
72:43 mentioned this a couple times a lot of
72:45 you know this for a fact you play video
72:47 games unless someone tells you that you
72:51 control the variables that control you
72:53 you might go your whole life you might
72:55 be 88 years old having never known that
72:59 that a lot of the trials and
73:01 tribulations that you dealt with which
73:03 that damaged you that removed your
73:05 ability to be happy were based on
73:07 variables that you actually controlled
73:09 now we all have variables we can't
73:12 control if you fall in love with someone
73:13 that's not good for you
73:15 man that's a tough one that's a super
73:18 tough one at that point you have to use
73:21 again I would say Tony Robbins technique
73:23 of really analyzing the pain and
73:25 pleasure of being with them to the point
73:27 where whatever rationale and confidence
73:30 you need to remove that person from your
73:32 life is made possible through perhaps a
73:35 very long process of attaching the bad
73:37 moments to being with this person and
73:40 just simply at one point your body will
73:41 go look we don't want to be with that
73:43 person because of all this negativity
73:44 despite the positive things that occur
73:47 the one thing I want to leave you with
73:49 and ice is an analogy I use all the time
73:53 in different shows here but this one's
73:54 real important please don't let yourself
73:58 be the pinball in the pinball machine
74:00 that has no control over itself life is
74:06 the are the bumpers the flippers the
74:08 kickers inside the pinball machine and
74:11 for those of you too young to know what
74:13 those are I think you understand what
74:14 I'm saying regardless you don't want to
74:16 be subject to the world just kicking you
74:18 around like a can it's okay if you wake
74:22 up and you realize wow I am the pinball
74:24 holy [ __ ] I don't want to be the pinball
74:26 where do I even start well your your
74:28 solution is one tiny variable at a time
74:32 you know we we are so electronic now
74:35 that there's a sad reality to us solving
74:38 problems in our life but let me ask the
74:40 me sorry let me suggest to you the
74:43 primitive method for solving most of
74:45 your problems in life it's called a pin
74:48 and paper screw your iPhone screw your
74:52 tablet screw your computer get a pen and
74:55 paper preferably a notebook that just
74:57 has paper in it with either lines or no
74:59 lines and you need to start documenting
75:02 your life documenting what's good what's
75:04 bad if you want just make a column a two
75:07 column piece of paper just draw a tee at
75:08 the top of the draw the tee all the way
75:10 to the bottom of the page all the stuff
75:11 you hate on the Left all stuff you love
75:13 on the right things that bother you on
75:14 the left things that you love on the
75:15 right
75:17 now for the things that are on the right
75:20 well what we study them make sure that
75:22 you can you know you're not doing
75:23 anything that would sabotage them right
75:26 if you're with the person you really
75:27 love
75:27 and you're got some squeeze on the side
75:29 it's probably time to make a choice even
75:32 though even if you can play the game and
75:34 both people don't know it it's a bad
75:36 formula to get into let me tell you
75:38 right but all those things about your
75:41 life all that the employment things you
75:45 know YouTube as I've said several times
75:47 it's a college course onto itself I
75:50 would love to have enough money to take
75:52 some kids at eighteen and ask them what
75:56 they want to be in life build them a
75:58 place they can come put them in a
75:59 cubicle and have assistants help them
76:01 find videos online that teach them
76:04 everything about what they want to do
76:06 and just see if we can't get a kid to
76:09 have a higher IQ and four years and
76:11 someone going to any major university on
76:13 planet earth because they can watch the
76:15 lectures at the colleges that cost half
76:17 a million dollars per for per degree and
76:21 the beautiful thing is is you know the
76:23 theme of this show is rebuilding Society
76:25 to re highlight the the wisdom that was
76:30 lost it's only you know 50 60 years old
76:34 50 60 years ago you can find wise people
76:37 everywhere males females whatever and
76:38 they could just tell you a couple
76:39 sentences and your whole life would be
76:41 better but those people have passed on
76:44 they're my grandparents you see kids
76:48 today behaving badly well you've got you
76:51 know baby boomer children raising Gen X
76:54 children raising Gen Y children and Gen
76:56 Z children no wonder where's any of the
76:59 wisdom coming from right so we have to
77:02 work together and pass the information
77:03 that we have to each other that's why
77:04 your comments in the comments section on
77:06 YouTube are extremely important share
77:11 what's worked in your life you know yeah
77:14 I had this problem this is what I did to
77:16 fix it it worked for me it may not work
77:18 for you but hey man if you can touch one
77:20 person in the world think about it
77:23 you post a comment on a video and one
77:26 person reads it and goes oh my god
77:28 you're right a plus B equals C
77:30 cause-and-effect model and what if that
77:33 person is twenty years old and lives to
77:36 be 100 your impact from a single comment
77:39 provided 80 years
77:41 bliss for another human being or a much
77:43 better life than they would have had had
77:44 they not read your words pretty powerful
77:48 stuff right we have to believe in this
77:51 process of information exchange and
77:53 currently you know even though Obama
77:55 gave the United States internet over to
77:57 I can before he left
78:00 hopefully we can get that control back
78:02 but hopefully we don't lose this
78:04 beautiful means of communicating with
78:05 each other we're in a renaissance 2.0 of
78:11 intellectual and spiritual exploding
78:14 right the world is waking up we are
78:17 rebirthing probably better than any time
78:20 in history the ability to think you
78:25 don't have to agree with anything that I
78:27 say but if I make you think about what
78:29 you contrary
78:30 contrarily believe right you don't
78:33 believe what I believe cause you believe
78:34 in other philosophy then I've got you to
78:37 think about what you love more in the
78:39 world which is the truth that you
78:40 believe there's a powerful thing you
78:43 know I got a lot of unsubscription when
78:44 I did the episode on aliens and demons I
78:50 really threw down my disdain for the way
78:55 that Christianity has kind of affected
78:57 the world not the message within and the
78:59 truth within but the fact that I don't
79:01 believe that Jesus ever existed but if I
79:03 say that and it riles you up then your
79:05 belief in Christ fortifies if that's
79:09 what you want to believe hey there you
79:11 go I just strengthened your belief even
79:14 though I am a person who doesn't believe
79:15 what you believe on that note let's just
79:18 put a little footnote in before we close
79:19 out of this rather long episode the
79:22 movie Last Temptation of Christ directed
79:24 by Martin Scorsese with Willem Dafoe
79:28 playing Jesus a lot of people protested
79:31 that show in 1985 when it came out
79:34 embarrassingly so but the funny thing is
79:37 if they'd watch the movie if you believe
79:40 in Christ at the end of that film if
79:42 your belief in Christ doesn't increase
79:45 then you're missing the point of the
79:48 show it was
79:51 in episode was a movie created to help
79:53 you believe in Christ by taking him down
79:55 a path that if you believed in him could
79:58 not have happened it had no value to go
80:00 the other way and so him dying for our
80:03 sins and all that stuff became the focal
80:07 point of the apex of the entire movie
80:10 the climax of act 3
80:12 but the ignorant people protested it
80:15 having never seen it I hope you fail me
80:20 in this episode one of the most common
80:24 requests I get is to deal with stress do
80:26 you have an episode that deals with
80:27 stress and I always point them out the
80:29 calming your syllabus ode which if you
80:32 want any more of this particular talk go
80:34 and look up calming your soul
80:35 I forgot what number it is I believe
80:38 it's season 2 it could be season 1 I'm
80:42 not sure but do me a favor as your
80:45 homework 1 if you're stressed please
80:49 listen to this episode as many times as
80:51 you need to start fortifying
80:54 methodologies and perspectives to get
80:58 yourself out of that torment because you
80:59 don't deserve to be stressed it will
81:02 make you unhealthy it could potentially
81:03 develop cancers in your life so it's
81:05 important that you make changes
81:07 sometimes you have to make big changes
81:09 risk to gain right I picked up
81:14 everything I owned at 17 years old with
81:18 236 bucks in my pocket having just spent
81:20 $100 to get the California and I drove
81:23 to California in the 1976 Dodge Charger
81:25 special edition right which looks like a
81:28 Cordoba not the General Lee I drove to
81:31 California and I said in my mind I'd
81:32 already lined up a job but I said in my
81:35 mind if I got to live in my car then
81:37 that's what I got to do I risk
81:39 everything my reputation
81:42 potentially you know you know in terms
81:45 of you know Guns and Roses I was coming
81:48 to the jungle Southern California but I
81:52 showed the universe that I was willing
81:54 to take that risk to do anything to
81:56 better myself and better my family and I
82:00 did it I didn't have any money any
82:03 silver spoon or
82:04 anything like that worked it up from
82:06 nothing but I also had a beautiful
82:10 childhood in the 80s where I personally
82:12 charged myself in the age of 9 and up to
82:16 do the very best at every single thing I
82:18 wanted to be and so by the time I got to
82:20 California and you know and bump
82:22 shoulders with other folks they thought
82:23 I was a college student at 18 I might
82:26 call it I had my high school ring on and
82:27 people asked them to college that was
82:28 and they asked me that because I was
82:30 operating at their level you can be that
82:33 way to doesn't matter how old you are
82:35 man you can take up a brand new sport in
82:38 life a brand new career a brand new way
82:41 of making money or whatever
82:44 finding love being a better person
82:45 calming down how many people that you
82:47 know in life that were really angry when
82:49 they were young and they just petered
82:51 out they just calmed down maybe they
82:53 were really narcissistic when they were
82:55 young and then they kind of released
82:56 their ego because they realized they did
82:57 succeed by being narcissistic they
82:59 succeeded and then it was kind of like
83:01 hey I've been privileged to succeed and
83:04 now I don't need to showboat it to
83:06 anybody right hopefully don't go through
83:08 that problem but if you're in that
83:09 problem that's one one thing that might
83:11 happen to you right but if you are in a
83:14 position of success right now you feel
83:17 very comfortable with your life my
83:20 homework for you is to try and find
83:23 someone you can pass that information to
83:25 and if you know let's say you're 65 year
83:28 old male and you're sitting in your
83:29 studio apartment or whatever your nice
83:31 house your million-dollar home whatever
83:32 and you're bored to death you've got all
83:36 the money in the world that you want
83:37 doesn't mean you're a 100 millionaire
83:39 but you got enough
83:39 you got your residuals come in you don't
83:41 need to do anything we'll try to find
83:43 somebody you can pass it to then have to
83:46 be a little kid it could be someone in
83:48 their 20s someone in the 30s could be
83:49 your neighbor
83:50 it'll be the guy sitting next to you at
83:52 the deli or at the you know the
83:54 breakfast spot the diner best thing you
83:58 can do is you know make conversation
84:00 with them and ask that magic question
84:02 what do you do for a living boom at that
84:04 point you open up their soul you can
84:06 find out where they've been for years or
84:09 make a couple months if they're in the
84:10 middle of a high-risk situation I'm in
84:14 shinned this before I'll mention again
84:16 that I'll close out here
84:17 I met a guy at a smoke lounge about 15
84:21 miles from here and he had worked for
84:24 another man at a air-conditioning
84:26 company
84:27 I guess the air conditioning heating
84:28 company for 20 years and his father was
84:33 involved at some investment level with
84:35 another guy and his father was retiring
84:36 he was worried that the guy that his
84:39 partner his father was partner would
84:41 didn't like him very much he wanted his
84:43 children to take over the company not
84:44 his partner which was him and I talked
84:47 with him for about half an hour and I I
84:49 just kept iterating you know listening
84:53 to what he was saying and did a
84:53 reflection session with the guy so he
84:55 could hear his own words and we got to
84:57 the end of the conversation I said look
84:59 what you've told me is you've got
85:00 everything lined up to start your own
85:02 business you got the clients you have a
85:04 hundred percent of the knowledge you
85:06 know where the workers are people like
85:08 you more than this other [ __ ] so you
85:10 could probably get them to jump ship to
85:11 you you're not going to jump ship into a
85:13 void you're going to jump ship into half
85:15 a dozen customers if not a dozen
85:17 customers you're going to be able to pay
85:19 the bills you can work out of your house
85:20 just to have your trucks all loaded up
85:21 ready to go get a little tiny warehouse
85:23 for any products that you need to store
85:26 doesn't sound like his business worked
85:28 that way in the first place they order
85:29 exactly what the customer needs and
85:30 there's a lead time and they install it
85:32 it's great buy time I was done with this
85:33 guy he had heard about 80% of his own
85:36 words back i had a 20% new DNA of
85:39 proving to the guy that he had every
85:41 single thing in place to succeed he was
85:45 a new man by the end of the conversation
85:46 he actually turned to me and said I have
85:48 to talk with you more often because this
85:51 is what I've needed to hear for 20 years
85:54 and my father's not telling me these
85:56 things be that guy that talks to people
86:00 or that girl you know some of you
86:04 probably don't feel qualified because
86:05 you're trying to get your own game
86:06 together but I'm willing to bet you
86:08 succeed in some areas that you think are
86:09 trivial that other people think are
86:11 insurmountable be that person anyway I
86:16 think that's it if you made it this far
