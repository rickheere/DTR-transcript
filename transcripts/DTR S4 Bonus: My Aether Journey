00:00 [Music]
00:32 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:34 gentlemen I think this might be the redo
00:39 of the season for review or just a
00:44 little mezzanine episode here between
00:47 seasons now listen back to the season
00:50 four one and it's just a little loose on
00:53 the old information but the other point
00:57 you know I did make my points I think I
00:59 just filled it with a few obscure
01:02 stories and anecdotes that weren't that
01:04 interesting so we're gonna throw another
01:08 one on the barbie here not sure exactly
01:11 where we're going I almost want to do
01:14 another one on the ether man let me do
01:17 that at least that'll be the first part
01:19 of this show this is just a little
01:21 throwaway in the middle of the season
01:22 here in the middle of the the mezzanine
01:26 between seasons so here's my dilemma my
01:32 dilemma is that I have explained this
01:34 [ __ ] like a hundred times right
01:38 sometimes episodes that are completely
01:40 dedicated to the subject matter other
01:42 times just you know good 30 to 40
01:44 percent of another episode and I still
01:48 have people coming in wonderful people
01:50 coming in and going hey dude man I don't
01:52 think you quite understand or it sounds
01:54 like you have a problem with that or and
01:57 then I'm thinking oh wow I've either
01:59 failed you completely to describe what I
02:02 am believing to have solved or there's
02:08 just some weird disconnect and still I
02:11 think my responsibility to narrate this
02:13 in such a way that we get on the same
02:14 page at least so that you understand me
02:17 again I'm not trying to change your
02:18 opinions I would hope that you could go
02:23 through the experience I went through
02:25 because it was extremely I was gonna say
02:30 religious but it's not religious it's a
02:33 bad term because there's too much crap
02:34 attached to that but it's it was like
02:37 it's like so some people describe
02:39 ayahuasca trips or my LSD trips where
02:43 your life will never be the same and a
02:45 lot of the obstacles in scientific
02:51 thinking vanished for me and everything
02:53 comes together so let me start back at
02:57 the beginning and I'll just take you on
03:00 my journey of discovering science how bi
03:04 got early confused and then how this
03:09 reintroduction of the way that it works
03:12 through Eric Dollard back to the guys
03:15 that created everything that we're
03:17 experiencing right now again this show
03:19 is being brought to you by people who
03:20 believed in ether that's what you have
03:23 to understand but I had no idea what you
03:28 know physics was I didn't know what
03:34 anything atomic was I had no knowledge
03:37 as of 8 years old I moved to Derby
03:40 Kansas my parents took me to see an
03:42 adult movie called China Syndrome China
03:46 Syndrome was a hot it was a perfectly
03:49 drop movie because we had a scare at our
03:51 nuclear power plants in the central
03:53 Midwest think it's Pennsylvania or
03:55 something like that
03:56 ha wherever Three Mile Island was we had
03:59 a president who had a degree in physics
04:02 I think and it was even in nuclear
04:04 physics or something like that which was
04:05 Jimmy Carter who's a peanut farmer and
04:08 he supposedly went in there and did
04:10 something and you know brought the press
04:12 with them and he solved a problem I mean
04:14 it was kind of funny but China Syndrome
04:17 was dropped right on top of that for
04:18 your bubble to essentially say that you
04:22 know a nuclear power plant could go
04:24 critical and it could disturb the world
04:27 now China Syndrome is it's just a funny
04:30 little name for it because the idea is
04:33 that if you dig all the way down you
04:36 would pop out in China from America and
04:38 it's we would be in India you know it's
04:40 like we're nowhere near China
04:41 if you dig all the way through the earth
04:43 so I'm 9
04:45 and I see this movie and it freaks me
04:47 out and you know I I have a hard time
04:50 understanding my older buddies in
04:53 Hollywood who who grew up in the 50s and
04:57 they were terrified of nuclear bombs
04:58 even in the 40s and so I have a hard
05:02 time understanding that but when I think
05:03 about this little period of my life
05:05 where I was terrified of nuclear power
05:07 plants I get it so I Here I am at home
05:13 by myself no brothers and sisters the
05:15 World Encyclopedia has been installed in
05:16 my home my mom's always at work I spend
05:19 the whole day by myself at home if I'm
05:20 not going to school chilling with my
05:23 friends or whatever but a lot of times
05:24 just choosing to be by myself and so I
05:28 get out the Encyclopedia and I start
05:30 mowing through this thing at the atomic
05:33 level I go right for the word nuclear
05:38 the word atom the word you know atomic
05:40 and I start learning the base principles
05:42 of atomic weights and isotopes and power
05:48 plants and how vision works how they
05:50 bring together rods that are volatile
05:52 how atoms emit electrons because they're
05:55 too heavy you know 234 234 235 gets
05:59 pulled out the rest is depleted uranium
06:01 very volatile but not good for fission I
06:05 immerse myself at nine years old I then
06:10 research at nine how nuclear power
06:15 plants go critical and what techniques
06:18 were used at the time that released
06:20 published to cool them off iron you know
06:24 led rods led shavings a whole bed of
06:28 undisturbed water that would be put in
06:30 and replace the the really annihilated
06:33 atomic water that they've been using to
06:34 to spend turbines I don't know how but
06:38 the conversation got back to my uncle
06:40 who was a genius at this stuff he was a
06:44 quantum physics genius as well as all
06:47 the way back and so he starts bringing
06:49 in quantum physics and packet energy
06:51 theories I'm still nine years old I
06:54 design a brand-new
06:58 nuclear power plant which I'll try to
07:00 for this little episode to render
07:01 something in blender so you can see what
07:03 it did but it essentially removed the
07:07 rods half the rods from each other to
07:10 cool off the fission reaction to not
07:14 only drive
07:16 interrupters between them but to also
07:19 use all the known techniques demand to
07:21 cool this thing off I was done like I
07:25 solved it for myself without you know in
07:27 the ability to share it with the world
07:29 and I mean it would have been pretty
07:31 interesting if I had been able to do
07:33 this in 2019 and put this back online in
07:35 some 3d model so people could look at it
07:39 it'd be interesting to see what they
07:40 would have done so that's my first foray
07:42 into atomic physics right into small
07:49 particle physics and everything
07:50 radioactive right for me it makes
07:53 complete sense to this happens now
07:54 atomic bombs that people want to
07:56 speculate on that's a whole different
07:59 thing
07:59 plutonium whole different thing I didn't
08:02 spend time in that and that information
08:04 has been fairly sparse until recently
08:07 you know that probably last 20 years but
08:10 we all we've had the theory for 6070
08:14 years in terms of how it works even
08:18 Robert Heinlein got busted because he
08:19 wrote a book about atomic bombs before
08:21 they actually it happened and then they
08:23 questioned him how'd you know this ahead
08:25 of time that kind of stuff so people
08:26 would think about this for a long time
08:29 so during the eighties cuz I'm nine
08:31 years old 1978 I turned nine at the end
08:34 of the year I actually may have been in
08:37 1979 or whatever when this was actually
08:38 happening
08:39 I was actually think that was because
08:41 they go summertime so then I continued
08:45 working with my uncle every time I saw
08:47 the guy he's still living at home by
08:48 grandparents cuz he's not old enough to
08:50 leave yet and he's the genius that took
08:53 me through programming and all this
08:54 other stuff so I'm learning stuff from
08:56 him cos he's also sketch artist he's a
08:58 kung fu expert he's a judo expert I mean
09:01 it's just nuts what this guy was it's
09:03 probably still us to this day but what I
09:07 did in the 80s was one continued
09:10 soon this encyclopedia - started getting
09:16 hold every magazine every book I could
09:17 get out of either the library of my own
09:19 subscriptions and I am devouring this
09:22 stuff right I mean I am filling myself
09:25 with obviously a lot of pop science at
09:27 the same time but I'm not sitting there
09:28 not thinking so by the time I got the
09:31 physics class in the 80s in high school
09:35 when our teacher put a equals mc-squared
09:38 up there and said you know nothing could
09:39 travel faster just be like you know my
09:41 first question was what if they're wrong
09:43 pissed off my teacher tremendously
09:46 although he highly respected the
09:47 question he's like shut up I gotta teach
09:49 the class this and then we can talk
09:51 about you know the things later
09:54 off-camera you know you know like I said
09:58 I went down to because I had such a
10:01 fundamental early knowledge at 9 years
10:03 old of at least what they were telling
10:05 me things were doing especially pull
10:07 gravity you know I swallowed that hook
10:11 line & sinker I'm now studying you know
10:13 black holes at a huge level because
10:16 those were built up as a fear and doom
10:18 item that was gonna surf around the
10:19 universe and swallow everything up and
10:21 then I figured out how that worked by
10:23 the time I moved to California I wrote
10:26 my friends paper for school about 110
10:29 pages just breaking this thing down
10:31 again all official science and 99.9%
10:35 [ __ ] BIGBANG never I mean I study
10:39 the [ __ ] out of it but I just for
10:40 whatever reason just had a lack of
10:43 interest in it I think it was maybe deep
10:46 down inside I thought it was not the way
10:48 the thing started I don't really care
10:52 too much about that other than to get
10:53 people to understand it it falls on its
10:56 face a hundred percent and now black
10:57 holes supposedly [ __ ] evaporate which
10:59 is what Hawking said a long time ago you
11:04 know whether they can exist I don't know
11:06 there could be a push anomaly where that
11:07 could happen but they're probably more
11:09 like the one in black hole the movie
11:12 than the one that's theorized to exist
11:14 today so keep going and I am studying
11:17 about 1987 I got well I should back up
11:20 one second I started studying
11:22 electronics with my dad
11:25 formerly repairing electronic things and
11:29 my neighbor in my neighborhood in my
11:31 town by probably eighty-four and so
11:34 between 84 and 86 I am making money off
11:39 repairing VCRs and all kinds of other
11:42 little things and he was a Heathkit guy
11:45 so I watched him build things and so I'm
11:46 asking him what's that what's this
11:48 what's that and he would tell me what
11:50 they were but it was always sort of a
11:52 blunt answer not the scientific theory
11:54 of electrons moving through electronic
11:56 components I didn't know anything about
11:58 binary high/low signals for the digital
12:00 digital communication between components
12:02 then in 87 I moved to California and I
12:07 signed up for this
12:08 this robotics course through the mail
12:10 which has a first tier of electronic
12:13 second tier building your robot and over
12:14 the course of the of whatever it was two
12:18 or three year course you got the pieces
12:20 to build this robot eventually I stopped
12:23 that program because that class because
12:25 they said we're gonna be with you if you
12:28 have any issues and it was when I got
12:30 two coils that were a little confusing
12:31 for me
12:32 and I was having a problem with one of
12:34 my tests then I sent you know I think I
12:37 had to a telephone a 1-800 number to ask
12:40 my question and I was getting no
12:42 response and I was paying and like start
12:44 like a hundred bucks a month for this
12:45 thing and finally I just said look I'm
12:48 not gonna give you any more money until
12:50 you answered my question since I've got
12:51 a really fundamental question about a
12:53 coil I just need you to answer it and
12:55 they weren't answering so I said fine
12:56 you know you're not holding up your end
12:58 of the bargain and of course they
13:00 immediately started threatening me to
13:01 mess up my credit rating and I'm like to
13:03 just stop shipping me [ __ ] you know I've
13:05 definitely paid for everything that's
13:06 happened so far well I took it further I
13:08 did learn a crap about it and I
13:10 eventually resolved my knowledge of how
13:11 coils worked still left me a little
13:15 empty again on the digital electronic
13:17 communication of how chips work so I
13:21 went back into because I then had a a
13:23 boss and a mentor who was like my uncle
13:28 except smarter if that could happen and
13:32 he and I would sit around for hours at
13:35 his place doing all
13:37 kinds of wild ass projects and I mean
13:39 I'm telling you was [ __ ] Willy
13:40 Wonka's world of coding and art and
13:45 physics and just it was dope as [ __ ]
13:49 okay
13:49 so I'm doing a bunch of AI the other
13:54 project I started before I got a high
13:56 school was programming my first AI my
13:59 first sentient life AI thing and it I'll
14:05 just tell you this much I saw a bunch of
14:08 my code in West world on those little
14:12 pads especially how the hosts were
14:15 figuring out a talk and it's all
14:18 standard stuff today no big deal and you
14:19 know it's probably standard stuff while
14:21 I was doing it it's just I didn't have
14:23 access to anyone else in the whole world
14:24 so I'm doing my own little research
14:26 program so then I with this guy because
14:29 I had this amazing coder who if I don't
14:31 know how to do it he knows how to do it
14:32 and he was a big Lisp AI coder he was a
14:36 special special coder okay he had spent
14:40 ten years programming AI to a level that
14:43 few people on earth ever have okay but I
14:46 start writing the white papers on how to
14:49 create an AI to go to the next level and
14:52 he's looking at my stuff going wow I
14:55 haven't seen this before that's pretty
14:57 cool keep going so I started writing
14:59 those papers and he and I got separated
15:02 because our company kind of blew up a
15:05 little bit and got acquired and I went
15:07 off to do video games and he went so he
15:09 and I steeped in communication but I
15:13 then started working on a because I
15:17 already had like almost ten years by
15:20 about 1988-89 I started working on a
15:22 unified theory paper which is to say I'm
15:25 going to figure out this phenomenon
15:27 which is pole gravity this thing that's
15:32 a phenomenon right how do two atoms
15:35 communicate between each other now I'm
15:36 completely wrong because I didn't know
15:38 about eighth ether now this became so
15:43 intense I finally wrote a paper gave it
15:45 to my buddy he read it you know this guy
15:49 is like
15:50 Dartmouth graduate I can't even tell you
15:54 about him I can't can't even tell his
15:56 name it's illegal he could disagree and
15:59 tell you but I won't but he tried to get
16:03 my paperwork according to him to
16:07 Hawking's people at Santa Barbara
16:09 University but it cuz he read it and he
16:12 said look this is one of the best
16:13 theories I've ever heard this makes
16:15 sense and my paper was essentially
16:18 working with the frequency of energy
16:21 creating looking it's probably part of
16:25 ether as well but I started looking at
16:28 how do things attract on earth and I
16:31 focused on how surfers ride waves and
16:34 the fact that the frequency when it
16:35 changes starts creating an attractive
16:37 almost corkscrew pull but can also if
16:40 you've ever floated out to sea sitting
16:43 on a raft it can be a repulsion to
16:45 depending on what side of the frequency
16:46 you're on
16:47 so I created a model of the universe
16:49 where all energy is moving obviously at
16:53 a vibrational frequency and through
16:55 various changes in frequency it will
16:57 create the same effect as the shore does
16:59 to water right so in the water wave is
17:03 in the middle of the ocean with a seven
17:04 mile deep bottom end it's pretty unified
17:08 you know within reason of a storm
17:10 [ __ ] with or anything like that but
17:11 as soon as it starts coming towards the
17:12 shore starts hitting the shore and
17:14 that's when you get a wave and that's
17:15 where people can start writing things
17:18 and of course high tide low tide is a
17:20 bunch of frequency issues that may or
17:22 may not happen in the universe but I
17:24 went down this for 15 more years after I
17:27 wrote the paper that he read I would go
17:30 on walks with my friends in the Bay Area
17:32 who were fairly smart and and I would
17:35 just start explaining it to them because
17:37 it was important to me that whatever I
17:38 came up with was understandable by the
17:40 average human being because I figured if
17:42 it was true it would be very easy for
17:46 anyone to understand I still believe
17:48 that to this day and I think ether
17:49 finally heals the whole thing but we'll
17:52 get there about the bye about the
17:55 mid-90s the only scientific thing I'm
17:58 working on is the unified theory
18:02 I got books full of my notes and my
18:06 theories and I've got failed theories
18:08 and I went down branches of the tree
18:10 that didn't work out I did Egyptology
18:12 for six years on top of that so that was
18:14 a huge huge time sink which I agree
18:18 enjoyed it's all novice stuff but now
18:22 for the physics part of it and even for
18:24 actually for the Egyptology side of it I
18:26 got to the Bay Area like I've said to
18:30 you guys several times I found the
18:31 Stanford library now some of it starts
18:34 to require mathematics to absolutely
18:37 prove a particular model my focus was
18:41 above and beyond that to say you don't
18:46 know what you're trying to figure out
18:47 mathematically until you have a physical
18:49 model or a theory or a hypothesis that
18:51 is what you're trying to prove
18:53 mathematically so let's stay out of the
18:56 math until we have something that makes
18:57 sense on paper that could you know we
19:00 it's almost as if you know certain
19:03 things are occurring because you can
19:04 observe them you know certain things
19:05 occur because you can write it down on
19:08 paper and that's the physics of how
19:10 things work for instance you know if you
19:12 have a heavy beam over two supports made
19:16 if a certain amount of steel or titanium
19:17 you start putting pressure on the center
19:19 of the beam you know eventually you're
19:21 gonna bend the beam you don't need the
19:23 math yet how much it's going to require
19:27 to bend the beam and at what rate before
19:30 the beam will lose its integrity Bend
19:32 really quickly get hot whatever lose its
19:35 entire composition is something that
19:38 engineers need to figure out but first
19:41 we figure out that this occurs by pure
19:44 observation or logic but then I start to
19:48 notice probably in late 90s that science
19:51 starts to get a capital S when I again
19:55 it's it's weird to see black holes fully
19:59 theorized and dismissed and then all the
20:01 sudden there's like a ten year low and
20:03 boom they're at the center of the galaxy
20:05 they're [ __ ] everywhere again and
20:07 it's like what Hawking said what other
20:10 people have said about them dissipating
20:12 and fizzling out that's a that's a 25
20:14 year old statement if not
20:16 thirty old statement and people are just
20:19 looking the other way like it never was
20:20 sent even by people they say are the
20:23 authorities in the universe you know
20:25 being planet Earth strange so I let go I
20:31 let go of the unified theory I think
20:33 I've got it as far as I can take it
20:35 without being hit on the head and seeing
20:37 something brand-new and then I don't
20:39 remember what year it was I think it was
20:42 around 2010
20:43 I somehow bump into this guy Eric dollar
20:47 by 2014 during the recording of MKULTRA
20:51 radio I took the super deep dive and
20:55 immediately I was stunned with the
20:58 amount of stuff I needed to learn to
21:01 understand what Eric dullard was saying
21:03 which was again reading the books of our
21:07 forefathers of electricity and he starts
21:11 mentioning ether they have to understand
21:14 in 2014 I would I had drank the kool-aid
21:18 my entire life
21:19 ether when in one ear was dismissed and
21:22 out the other air so it never took took
21:26 root in my mind ever and the all those
21:29 years I just told you I was pol gravity
21:31 that's it now here's the thing during my
21:36 Unified Theory research I had one
21:41 guiding principle one controlling idea
21:44 which was it must it must make sense in
21:47 a physical model I had even halfway
21:51 through had dismissed any notion of a
21:53 positive or negative particle I said
21:56 this has got to occur if atoms are
21:58 exchanging information thus creating
22:00 some sort of attraction towards each
22:02 other which is the most ludicrous
22:03 [ __ ] thing if you just think about it
22:05 it just doesn't happen it just doesn't
22:07 happen okay not like they say okay I'm
22:13 gonna give them a little I'm gonna throw
22:15 into this episode a possibility that is
22:18 part of a additional force that might be
22:21 construed as a pole but I wanted to see
22:26 and that you'll see it in my first
22:27 episode one
22:29 the fundamentals of universe I start
22:31 talking about the fabric of the universe
22:32 because I just started to to put the
22:35 pieces together but I wanted a physical
22:38 model it had to work I had to
22:41 essentially be able to explain it with
22:43 like marbles on a table you know and in
22:45 my mind and putting them in a zero
22:47 gravity situation but you know you just
22:48 see him on a table you subtract the the
22:50 gravity's holding to the table and you
22:52 have a zero gravity environment but I
22:54 started thinking about things in
22:56 three-dimensional space and it had
23:00 completely fallen apart he starts
23:03 talking about ether and the first slide
23:05 that Eric doll had put up was the slide
23:07 that they had drawn I don't know 100
23:09 years ago 150 years ago I talked about
23:12 the negative pressure between two
23:15 objects in a whirlwind of ether due to
23:19 blockage and dollar just presented it on
23:22 a page at this presentation at a college
23:27 with just no big defensive argument
23:31 against gravity he just said well you
23:33 know they had it all figured out we just
23:36 got duped because free energy is the
23:38 byproduct of understanding how ether
23:41 works okay so it takes me a while I've
23:47 got to go back through everything I ever
23:49 thought of part of it had to do with
23:52 dismissing things like black holes and
23:54 saying wait that's good that's always
23:57 been a theoretical thing it's never been
23:59 discovered in this [ __ ] picture of
24:01 one in space right the big plasma goatse
24:06 floating in space yeah hey whatever
24:08 whatever Jesus just ridiculous the fact
24:14 that people buy that stupid stupid image
24:17 as a black hole is just unfathomable to
24:22 me right it's like really that's how
24:24 [ __ ] easy it is to introduce a bunch
24:27 of [ __ ] in your brain wow those
24:30 people right now are there before I go
24:34 any further
24:35 are there still anomalies of what again
24:37 ether a particle was made out of sure
24:39 I'm just gonna say it's a smallest thing
24:42 that
24:43 if it's made of something else well
24:46 that's gonna be something we can get to
24:48 in a few centuries once we can just look
24:51 at ether particles moving in some device
24:54 which we may never achieve that but you
24:58 know don't underestimate us we might
25:00 figure it out if once we could
25:01 acknowledge that it exists like the guys
25:04 who discovered everything that we're
25:05 using right now to have this show happen
25:08 so I've got by 2014 let's just say I've
25:14 got let's see 27 years of angsty sort of
25:21 failed official science descriptions and
25:26 models or lack of models for gravity I
25:30 have read you know some of the best
25:35 quantum physics books in the entire
25:36 world college books that teach PhD level
25:41 students such that they can cram you
25:43 know work on their thesis entry level
25:46 books all the pop science books from
25:49 Hawking a lot of people don't even try
25:52 to cover it which is interesting and
25:54 there's zero there's zero there to
25:57 really explain things well there's a ton
25:59 of mathematics once you get to the
26:01 college level books and then you get
26:03 kind of lost cuz you're like what are
26:04 you trying to prove in you know the this
26:07 seeing algorithms on a page just gets a
26:10 publisher off man oh my God look at that
26:12 looks so legitimate you know and then I
26:16 thought of the correlation with water
26:19 something Dollard never said and
26:23 anything I ever seen that I have seen
26:25 him say and I started thinking well then
26:28 I did again so I'm seeing this stuff in
26:32 water I'm seeing how water behaves and
26:35 my whole life I've been around water
26:37 again like I always say when I see a
26:39 current of water it's always just
26:41 fascinating don't even tell me you as
26:43 kids when you're a little kid in the
26:45 bathtub and your mom or dad pulls the
26:48 plug you're like I don't want to get out
26:49 until this little tornado stops you know
26:51 that was me as a little kid I used to
26:53 sit for hours in the kitchen
26:56 filling up the sink and pulling that
26:58 plug and watching that drain happen and
27:00 just playing with the tornados of my
27:03 fingers and and just being mystified by
27:06 this beautiful little thing that's
27:09 happening it's still water but it's I'm
27:12 calling it a current or a tornado
27:14 because of the way it behaves right
27:16 there in my brain I'm realizing that
27:19 when something makes a shape and behaves
27:21 in a particular way I give it a
27:24 different name even though it is just
27:26 one thing water and then someone in the
27:29 last five years remind me of the old
27:31 saying as it is above so too is it below
27:34 and that's powerful but what's more
27:38 powerful for me is as it is below so too
27:43 is it above no one ever says it that way
27:47 but for me it's like I don't have access
27:48 to the above I got access to the below
27:51 and the idea that the universe has two
27:54 books of physics ain't gonna pass my
27:56 tests it is not going to pass so up
27:59 there it's the same way it behaves down
28:01 here and we're not supposed to think
28:04 like that we're supposed to keep
28:05 everything weird you know like a quasar
28:06 supposedly on the edge of the universe
28:08 flying away from the Big Bang at twice
28:11 the speed of light they're supposed to
28:14 have its own physics out there and then
28:16 my drain has got a different physics and
28:18 the airs got different physics and the
28:19 ocean has a different physics it doesn't
28:21 it doesn't and I know that you know the
28:25 laws of fluidity and thermodynamics and
28:29 all these things have been telling us
28:31 for years there's just basic laws and
28:32 that's it but why haven't these
28:35 conversations advanced to what I've been
28:37 telling you guys on the show
28:39 eventually I promise you if we don't go
28:43 in some you know rollerball 1975
28:46 cleansing of history and this show gets
28:48 erased if this show sticks around for
28:49 another hundred years somehow someone
28:51 keeps it in some container somewhere I
28:54 promise you
28:55 someone's gonna look back and go see he
28:57 was 100% correct he cited all of his
29:00 resources he put a little bit of analogy
29:03 on it and a little bit of explanation
29:07 that made it easier to understand
29:08 perhaps there's not his idea
29:10 he never said they were his ideas but he
29:12 was begging you to understand how the
29:14 universe worked and you fought him every
29:16 [ __ ] step of the way and I'm not
29:19 using anyone anything because I don't
29:20 know what anyone believes but did you
29:22 know I get it I get a fare stream of
29:25 comments that are very respectful in the
29:28 YouTube channel Facebook we're we're
29:31 we're just a whole different breed on
29:33 our Facebook page it's fun I just lo
29:36 we're just differ and it's so inviting
29:39 it's like the most inviting it's ever
29:41 been to differ in my opinion but now
29:44 here's the thing I'm interviewing bart
29:47 sibrel in season 3 he mentions bubbles
29:51 is that we you know I think everything's
29:53 bubbles and bubbles prove that the world
29:55 is round and I'm not trying to go off on
29:57 a flatter thing with this guy he just
29:59 said bubbles and I was like oh yeah that
30:03 is the missing piece that I have needed
30:06 I had already said on the show if you
30:09 take that tornado that happens in the
30:11 drain when the water drains and you
30:13 remove the downward force of gravity
30:15 that we have because of the Earth's you
30:18 know negative pressure on the universe
30:21 then and that thing is gonna spin into a
30:23 ball it just will the reason why it
30:26 tapers towards the top and the bottom
30:28 creating a sphere is that the collision
30:31 has a center and as it spins out it does
30:35 diminish that the collisions cease to
30:38 exist and that's what's starting to
30:39 create this perfect round thing mixed
30:41 with some of the official definitions of
30:43 the Sun that really put the whole thing
30:48 together for me which was to say he said
30:50 look you've been lied to
30:52 there's a photon at the center of every
30:54 atom hmm photons are verbs then they'll
31:00 tell you that the Sun has a plasma core
31:03 then I had to go do a bunch of plasma
31:05 research which Eric dollar did a
31:06 gigantic presentation about plasma
31:08 energy really stating look this is
31:12 energy moving so quickly it hasn't
31:15 decided what to be therefore we call
31:17 that state of energy plasma it's what
31:20 electricity that fuels a lightning
31:24 it's made out of it's not dirt it's not
31:26 air it's not water it's plasma plasma
31:30 has a property plasma is so fast-moving
31:37 and so dense of its ether all particles
31:42 so agitated
31:43 remember plasma moves 50 times the speed
31:45 of light you can't see that it
31:48 penetrates everything it fuels all
31:51 constructs plasma is down from 50 times
31:55 the speed of light but probably much
31:56 faster than the speed of light so you
31:59 can see it it's intense
32:02 now its movement through the universe
32:05 might be way slower than the speed of
32:07 light we see these Jacobs ladders right
32:09 read that BAM between two wires okay
32:13 well that's a plasma energy construct
32:17 between the two wires and it's not
32:18 physically moving up the wires and you
32:20 think any faster than your you know your
32:23 hand could move through it but if you
32:26 were to zoom into that energy its Hall
32:29 and ass okay that's why it is what it is
32:31 and luckily we have a lot of insulators
32:34 and things to keep it from crawling all
32:35 over the universe and you know killing
32:37 everybody on the face of the earth it's
32:39 a limited quantity of this stuff so it
32:41 can't just reach out that's why when you
32:43 grab a wire and you get electrically
32:45 across your heart you don't always die
32:47 because you don't have enough electrons
32:50 pulverizing your muscle tissue most the
32:54 time it does so the first thing I needed
32:57 to solve for was a positive negative
33:00 charged particle a proton is positive an
33:04 electron is negative how the hell does
33:07 that happen why is it electrons so much
33:09 smaller than a proton how's the neutron
33:12 kind of neutral how's that occurring and
33:17 so I was in episode one of the first
33:21 season right I'm talking about the
33:23 spinning of particles something
33:26 scientists in physics Hawking talked
33:28 about spin one particles all the time it
33:31 is the orientation of the spin that
33:34 gives it the designation of either
33:35 positive or negative
33:37 now some just have a larger construct
33:39 and they become a proton other others
33:42 are more of a collision between two
33:44 smaller particles which is your electron
33:47 your magnetic wave hitting your
33:49 dielectric wave remember dielectric is
33:52 the ricochet off the center of an atom
33:54 your magnetism wave is the one that's
33:56 stuck in the orbit around an atom when
33:58 they collide you get an electron that's
34:00 why they always tell you in physics
34:02 class that the electron is really more
34:05 of a cloud around the neutron and the
34:07 proton and that's why a protons the size
34:11 of a grapefruit and electrons the size
34:13 of a BB that was that was the theory in
34:15 85 the heavier the element the more
34:19 unstable it is that's why uranium is so
34:22 volatile and unstable it is a giant
34:26 collection of etheral winds that are
34:29 trying to create all the distinct
34:31 without trying to they just happen to
34:34 create the distinctions of multiple
34:36 protons multiple neutrons thousands of
34:38 electrons you know and it's just hard to
34:40 hold it all in place and when it becomes
34:43 difficult to hold in place then you're
34:44 gonna have escaping electrons as the
34:49 dielectric wave is is bouncing off
34:52 because it's gigantic
34:53 elements there in space and all this
34:55 ether is pounding it it's going to have
34:57 all kinds of ricocheting particles off
35:00 of it the dielectric wave it's going to
35:03 have tons of orbital particles because
35:06 it's so heavy and big that's blocking
35:08 you throw winds thus creating the pole
35:12 sorry thus creating the push that is
35:16 gravity but they're gonna fly all over
35:18 the place and if you put them on your
35:19 body put them by your body you're dying
35:21 of this invisible killer called
35:24 radiation now once I realize that just
35:27 like again two tires in Formula One race
35:29 that are moving the same direction these
35:32 guys that bumped into each other with
35:34 their open tire racing their cars fly up
35:36 in the air they lit they usually are
35:38 knocked out of the race because they
35:39 damage their car so bet that's two
35:42 particles moving in the same direction
35:44 thus having the same charge both all the
35:47 tires let's just say that are moving
35:49 forward are positive
35:50 all the tires moving backwards or
35:52 negatives well for some reason they
35:55 could move forward with a tire moving
35:56 backwards and they bumped each other's
35:58 tires and they were relatively the same
36:00 velocity and spin then they would just
36:05 marry each other right like a sprocket
36:07 turning into another sprocket it would
36:10 work
36:11 that's why opposites attract and the
36:14 same forces repel just think of this
36:17 Formula One tires there you go there's
36:20 your basis of Howie through ill charges
36:22 designate themselves now tire could be
36:25 gigantic like a proton or it could be a
36:27 small little whirlwind that is an
36:30 electron then you have like the
36:33 conductive valence on a wire how
36:36 electricity moves on conductive
36:37 materials well this has always been a
36:40 weird little definition they gave you
36:42 for a valence they basically talked
36:44 about it like a chain saw blade all the
36:48 material on the outside all the
36:49 electrons on the outside are moving in a
36:51 loop on the outside of a conductive
36:54 surface you touch it to another
36:55 conductive surface electrons actually
36:57 jump over and like a blade from one
37:01 chain saw it jumps onto the blade of
37:03 another chain saw while at the bottom
37:04 where in the opposite direction in the
37:06 cathode technique of how actually
37:09 electricity moves which is negative to
37:11 positive the tooth will jump off from
37:14 the other blade and it replaces itself
37:15 so one-for-one correlation okay my brain
37:21 now that's a hopscotching reaction of
37:25 ether so imagine me sitting around with
37:28 27 years of frustrating sort of dead in
37:31 theories that even though I can come up
37:35 with some models that sort of kinda
37:38 explain things I get up I get back to
37:42 ether and all of a sudden pow everything
37:48 that I ever wanted in life from a
37:50 unified theory has been sitting in front
37:52 of my face well since 2014 but it's been
37:59 there my entire life and books that have
38:01 essentially been forbidden
38:03 to be taught which is why we don't learn
38:05 things about Tesla you're able to learn
38:09 things about all Volta and and Faraday
38:12 because they're sort of the basis of the
38:15 learning of electronics or electricity
38:17 in general the discoverers of
38:19 electricity but you're only using them
38:22 to create this sort of packet based
38:25 energy system you're not allowed to know
38:29 the fundamentals of what electricity is
38:31 made out of and you're not allowed to
38:34 know how the universe is held together
38:36 so now let's look at this idea that
38:39 there might be a pull to gravity I would
38:44 say there isn't technically a pull from
38:47 gravity where it's again sorry I
38:50 shouldn't say that there's no pull in
38:52 the traditional sense that is the
38:53 phenomenon of gravity that two atoms
38:55 pulling each other that never happens
38:57 ever ever ever but what does happen
39:00 we're pretty sure now it makes complete
39:03 and utter sense is that of the mass of
39:07 ether that holds together enough that
39:09 again you got this microphone it's solid
39:12 in the air here the smoke doesn't hit my
39:14 face and you know move my face right
39:16 it's it's very pliable and it's not
39:19 cohesive its cohesive enough to come up
39:21 you know to divert light in the camera
39:23 but around all things that exist there's
39:27 a plenty of escaping ether which in the
39:33 small sense doesn't really move a whole
39:34 hell of a lot and you have to have a
39:36 certain amount of you have to have mass
39:37 that's actually going to bump into it
39:39 and I give an example when you look at a
39:41 magnet you can hold a frigerator magnet
39:43 in your hand you're not feeling any
39:45 tingling in your fingers but you put it
39:47 against steel it goes book and it
39:49 attaches to your refrigerator it's
39:51 sitting there going Jesus how the hell
39:53 is that grabbing onto steel but not my
39:57 finger and you learn really young I'm
40:00 not made of steel that's why but there's
40:02 some weird relationship between the pole
40:03 around a magnet and its ability to grab
40:07 like bear claws into steel then we have
40:12 this Van Allen belt thing that you get
40:15 when you have a tongue
40:17 of ether and a gigantic configuration
40:20 called a planet again it's circular
40:23 because of the same reason bubbles are
40:24 circular in your soda and your beer it's
40:27 just that's what happens starts from a
40:30 little tiny embryo just like a baby and
40:32 it builds and builds and builds and
40:33 builds until it gathers up enough of
40:35 this ether in the universe to start
40:36 creating a plasma core then a
40:40 slow-moving crust then we get to live on
40:44 it God puts us here aliens put us here
40:46 who knows and there you have it
40:50 you got a planet well the Sun gives a
40:54 planet life because it gives us an
40:56 ecosystem of warmth I potentially gives
41:00 us shelter from just being a very heavy
41:02 object in space and sucks in all the
41:04 calves a cume cleaner all the crap out
41:05 there luckily we're infinitesimally
41:08 small compared to it so that things fine
41:11 around space potentially you know won't
41:13 hit us but we know the Sun and all the
41:17 cosmologists that have gone to the
41:19 electrical universe they preach this and
41:21 I think they're 100% correct the Sun has
41:24 its own layers of what we would might
41:26 classify as a Van Allen belt like
41:28 experience the Sun is a gigantic plasma
41:31 ball with the fire electrical crust
41:33 that's why the crust is hotter than the
41:34 insides the insides probably empty and
41:37 it can't hang on to everything that it
41:40 actually is and so as it's being birthed
41:42 constantly by the flow of ether through
41:45 its bowels and it simply continues to
41:47 exist because it has an infinite supply
41:50 of ether particles in the universe
41:52 relative to its size you know if the Sun
41:54 was the size of the universe that would
41:56 be it it's the only thing that can't
41:57 exist but since it's a lot smaller than
42:00 the entire universe we get this residual
42:04 orbiting ether which most likely pops
42:09 out of its top then it goes out touches
42:13 all the planets and goes back into the
42:14 balance that's why planets expand
42:16 because they're getting constantly
42:17 injected with new ether subatomic
42:19 particles probably above ether but with
42:23 just either you got it now the same way
42:27 the magnet is hanging on to the steel
42:30 is probably in addition to the very in
42:33 addition to the negative pressure
42:35 between us and the Sun and us and the
42:38 moon and everything else in the solar
42:39 system probably even the you know
42:42 obviously the galaxies in the universe
42:43 this ribbon that's going out in it all
42:48 layers that diminishes as it goes
42:49 further and further out from the Sun if
42:52 it's probably providing a bit of
42:55 magnetic pull towards the Sun simply as
42:59 a relationship of the ecosystem the flow
43:02 of ether particles that go through the
43:05 center of the earth you know goes
43:07 through us at all different levels but
43:09 because the earth is going to organize
43:11 the ether because of its displacement
43:14 it's going to organize that down into a
43:16 cone we already have a Van Alen but of
43:19 our own so the fan ball it's going to
43:20 organize and condense right and down the
43:23 center of our planet at the North Pole
43:26 go right down through the bottom pop up
43:29 the bottom so my mind that's the only
43:32 way that this could create a bit of a
43:34 pull sort of effect but it's not
43:37 necessarily two particles sharing
43:40 information like the traditional
43:44 phenomenon definition of gravity
43:46 remember the problem with the
43:49 traditional definition of gravity they
43:52 do at least say you know we know how
43:54 much attraction gravity has because
43:57 we've measured it a billion times right
43:59 but if you had a universe I don't know
44:03 how many gazillion trillion quadrillion
44:05 parsecs so you know across the thing
44:08 might be but according to the
44:10 traditional scientists if you had one
44:12 atom in the traditional sense of the
44:14 pop-culture definition of atomic mass on
44:18 one edge of the solar system or what is
44:20 it the universe excuse me and another
44:21 atom clear on the other side I probably
44:24 the round thing who knows but these two
44:28 things are actually still exchanging
44:31 information and pulling on each other
44:33 ever so slightly might take nearly
44:36 forever for them to finally meet in the
44:38 middle but according to them that's how
44:42 gravity works
44:43 that's one extreme example you can use
44:46 to test the theory and go that's
44:48 [ __ ] it doesn't work like that
44:50 now I just finished a documentary and
44:53 I'm gonna make an episode about this in
44:54 season 5 on Bob Lazar on Netflix a
44:59 friend of mine referred it to me and I'm
45:05 going to give you a preview as to how
45:08 powerful this theory of ether is towards
45:11 something that he claimed to not
45:14 understand at least in full and maybe
45:18 he's not saying he knows but he does
45:21 know I don't know in the documentary
45:25 Bob Lazar clearly states that we don't
45:29 know what gravity is which means he's
45:30 still hanging on to non a thorough
45:32 models of gravity which breaks my heart
45:35 such an amazing thinker has not
45:37 discovered a rediscovered ether and
45:41 given its validity he like he's being
45:43 doubted for saying that he worked at s4
45:45 and worked on UFOs and for me it's like
45:48 how can you doubt Tesla when everything
45:51 that you use mr. Lazar is based on ether
45:56 it's just right in your face man
45:58 I don't get it save yourself some some
46:02 research time right but he said that
46:05 this UFO that he worked on uses an
46:08 element called 115 and 115 is this
46:12 element that is considered to be a
46:15 pseudoscience element because it would
46:17 be terribly tough to create and I do not
46:20 know the the reasons why this is stuff I
46:24 don't know reasons why I need to look up
46:26 the whole thing before I do my episode
46:27 on it I will explain it in the episode
46:29 but the guy that made the documentary
46:31 claimed to have talked to like seven or
46:34 eight world-class physicists from Russia
46:37 to Europe to America about 115 and they
46:41 said eventually when being interviewed
46:43 by him well you know typically at a
46:46 low-hanging fruit you put a few minutes
46:48 of effort into understanding 115 it
46:50 remains a pseudo scientist pseudoscience
46:54 excuse me element in the periodic table
46:58 but most of them come down to the point
47:00 when they really think about it the
47:01 people he ended up talking to said well
47:03 you you really could create it it's just
47:05 gonna be really difficult to create it
47:07 according to Bob Lazar he drew a picture
47:10 of the 115 what shape it's in when they
47:13 found it inside the vehicle and then
47:16 they I guess through experimentation you
47:20 know according to him maybe even working
47:21 with the aliens that Ron one of these
47:24 nine ships you could create it and they
47:28 do create it and they create it in
47:30 layers and the way he drew it on a piece
47:34 of paper was he said they create
47:35 essentially discs of this stuff and they
47:40 stack up the disks until they create a
47:41 cylinder then they lay the cylinder down
47:45 into a cone a very tall pyramid cone so
47:49 it's almost like the shape of like an
47:51 incent that's the the pyramid instant
47:53 you know very tall thin cone but then he
47:57 says they cut off the sides of two sides
48:01 of the cone in parallel leaving a sliver
48:03 down the center from the top of the cone
48:05 the tippy-top premier pyramidion like
48:07 capstone of this thing all the way down
48:09 to the bottom and that's the shape it
48:11 needs to be in in order to get their
48:13 reaction from these reactors what was
48:18 sad to see was he didn't really seem to
48:20 understand and maybe he does and he's
48:22 just not saying why they build it the
48:25 way they build it and why it has the
48:27 effect that it has well in your Nonnie
48:30 through a model you're stuck you're
48:32 screwed I think once you go to an e
48:36 throw model what they have done
48:38 immediately makes sense immediately
48:41 makes sense man they'll get your magnet
48:44 theory in your brain right a disc magnet
48:47 which goes on the refrigerator hold your
48:49 um your oven mitt up there for you and
48:54 get a bunch of those you know that each
48:58 one of these disc magnets has a pole
49:00 around it which is the magnetism pole
49:02 that it has okay and then take them
49:10 and stack them up and you realize that
49:13 you're gonna get it essentially a coil
49:15 technique of augmenting the amplitude of
49:19 the wave because you're stacking them
49:21 all up on each other marrying the
49:24 magnetism wave such they become more and
49:26 more powerful you could even perhaps and
49:28 I don't know how 115 works so maybe it's
49:31 a more distinct wave it only moves in a
49:33 very distinct pattern what if you
49:36 rotated every disc just a little bit and
49:39 you start creating this flowery amazing
49:41 super-powerful wave don't know sacred
49:44 geometry right sacred geometry it could
49:47 be the shape of the wave that this be
49:50 slices make but in a cylinder it's not
49:53 the right shape it's not the right shape
49:56 to augment these other amplifiers that
50:00 go into the antimatter engines is
50:01 supposed to hang in the basement of
50:03 these flying saucers three of them in a
50:05 perfect triangle formation and down
50:07 below so now you take it and you you
50:13 turn it into a cone you lathe it then
50:15 you slice it now imagine that you had an
50:20 object that floured out and some of you
50:23 have done this with lights you've done
50:26 these with little crystals that emit
50:28 light and you know that the shape of the
50:30 crystal dictates the shape of the light
50:32 that's coming out of it where disco
50:34 balls do right there are little squares
50:35 they're glued to a disk or Sariah sphere
50:38 you hit up with a flashlight and cut
50:40 boom the cats are chasing all kinds of
50:42 crazy crap on the wall right but if you
50:45 just shaped that thing like a sliver of
50:47 a pyramid of a tall pyramid but inside
50:51 it was a bunch of round disks and now
50:54 you've got around this thing shaped like
50:56 a pyramid you may have just created the
50:58 beautiful perfect shape of its emitting
51:03 wave that is the 115 fuel that is the
51:06 basis that's gonna go into these
51:09 amplifiers the amplifiers have to be
51:11 configured to take that wave based on
51:15 the shape of that fuel so I could tell
51:17 it through your crystal it's funny but
51:20 he has said there's arches out of the
51:21 center that go inside the ship that
51:24 down to these three touch points on the
51:26 first floor or though I should say say
51:28 it should say the center floor if we say
51:29 the first floor is where they sit the
51:31 basement is where they have the three
51:33 hanging antimatter engines and the
51:35 upstairs is where they have the sensor
51:37 array which people mistaken and has
51:39 portal windows you're essentially
51:41 creating a snake of geometry methodology
51:43 of controlling ether winds what would be
51:50 any form of matter antimatter it doesn't
51:52 matter which side of the fence you're on
51:54 it's all made either now antimatter may
51:58 simply be a very bizarre inverted wave
52:02 of ether that when it touches matter it
52:06 cancels itself out any matter is a big
52:09 mystery as to whether or not man has
52:13 really created its hardest it when you
52:16 read all the CERN had drawn Collider
52:18 conspiracy theories they talk a lot
52:21 about antimatter being created and
52:22 creating a bunch of super negative you
52:25 know Cthulhu evil in the world blah blah
52:27 blah whatever it would seem to some of
52:31 the employees at CERN believes that they
52:32 have a demonic relationship with the
52:35 actual collider so who knows we'll leave
52:38 that for another episode but he also
52:41 drew the interior of the ship having
52:43 these archways around the center of the
52:46 inner crust of the inside of the ship
52:50 why archways well it looks as if the
52:56 graduated curve that would be those
52:58 archways are very precise extremely
53:01 precise they are made that way probably
53:03 you might think structural integrity
53:05 because arches are fantastic for
53:07 structural integrity maybe that's all it
53:08 is but it also may marry coincidentally
53:13 the geometry of the energy wave that's
53:16 coming out of this crystal that then
53:17 gets again souped up and turns into this
53:19 ability to do what he said in his
53:23 documentary he said this since the 90s
53:25 to warp space-time such that you create
53:27 a warp in space and the ship merely
53:29 moves into the warp well what would that
53:33 be in the ether model as I've said in to
53:35 UFO designing episodes
53:37 well it would create a negative space in
53:43 ether where there's at least less ether
53:46 may not be a complete vacuum you ether I
53:48 don't think you want to do that because
53:49 what if you trade created a true vacuum
53:51 of ether you are annihilating anything
53:53 that existed in that space-time now
53:57 warping is interesting because you
53:58 simply may not be like let's just say a
54:01 bird was flying by the outside of the
54:03 ship on the left side it wants to go
54:05 left and so it does a bunch of warping
54:06 on the left and the bird is in the
54:08 pocket of which the wave would occur
54:09 maybe the bird is simply just stretched
54:12 out like silly putty and once it flies
54:17 out of that warp it turns back into the
54:19 shape that it sees and it doesn't
54:20 actually lose its integrity doesn't lose
54:22 its heart in its lungs and everything
54:24 because it all was just everything was
54:26 squished and condensed and it's just
54:28 fine it flies through let's hope that's
54:30 the case right but he said that one of
54:32 the things that they showed him when he
54:33 first got there was this 115 being put
54:37 inside of a metal cylinder that held it
54:39 looks like about a inch in diameter you
54:43 put it I think you put it in vert it so
54:45 the point goes down I think which would
54:47 make sense because if the Assen if it's
54:50 going outward then you were sending out
54:53 part of that wave but on top of that
54:56 they put a round steel half dome and
55:00 then they said try to touch it and he
55:03 tries to touch it and he's there's a
55:05 force field there he couldn't touch the
55:06 metal and he said that that was a major
55:09 Epiphany to him because he goes oh my
55:11 god there's actually a force field there
55:13 which means we could actually create if
55:15 we had 115 in every tank you could
55:18 create a force field around a tank and
55:19 nothing can touch it and I mean nothing
55:22 not even a human hand could touch it let
55:24 alone some ordnance from something or an
55:27 eye Edie Edie would just bounce off of
55:29 it now you might be able to create a
55:31 hole that would fall into but you
55:34 wouldn't be able to hurt the occupants
55:35 inside as long as this was on so this is
55:39 the price that I think we're paying by
55:41 not pulling her head out and just
55:43 acknowledging this because think about
55:45 how many people well I could think about
55:47 it because I know there's dozens of
55:50 people
55:51 that watch the channel regularly that
55:54 are still spending calorie energy
55:55 denying that this stuff exists thus
55:59 denying the science of it and that means
56:01 that those brains are halted not able to
56:06 remotely understand Tesla's empirical
56:09 true fact life that means his experiment
56:13 in Colorado Springs Colorado can't be
56:17 understood his giant antenna he started
56:21 building from 1917 to 1927 you can't
56:24 understand it you just literally have
56:27 shut your brain off and went lalalalala
56:29 and you can't understand it which means
56:31 the brains of this man goes one more
56:33 [ __ ] generation without being
56:35 understood it means you can't explain it
56:37 to a child so if you have kids that are
56:39 interested in science and you want to
56:41 pass them the biggest gift they could
56:42 possibly have which is the knowledge
56:44 from our predecessors you can't do it
56:47 which means they're gonna go right back
56:49 into capital s science and then what are
56:50 you gonna do
56:51 goddamn it kid why are you studying this
56:53 stuff well daddy mommy it's the only
56:55 thing you ever let me learn you never
56:57 gave me the real key to the universe and
56:59 then let's say 30 years later they
57:01 actually discovered what I discovered
57:03 and they're like oh my god mom dad this
57:05 is great man we get free energy I just
57:07 built this thing in the garage and
57:08 they're like well I heard of that stuff
57:10 before you were born
57:11 oh you're so smart you didn't tell me
57:14 why didn't you tell me well I thought it
57:16 was [ __ ] really dad mom really how
57:21 does your cell phone work how does
57:23 electricity work how does all this stuff
57:25 work that these guys who invented this
57:28 stuff and proved it existed told you
57:31 existed argued that people were lying to
57:34 you that then when they said it didn't
57:35 exist why couldn't you just take their
57:39 findings and give it to me you don't get
57:41 it I understand but don't hold me back
57:44 my kid has already grown up you know but
57:47 I think about having taught her pop
57:50 science as a kid it's funny man I you
57:53 know I it's one of those things I can
57:55 always tell my daughter like look other
57:57 than you know a few little fairy tales
57:58 when you were a kid to make you behave
58:00 once every December
58:03 I never lied to you ever and now I have
58:09 to say well accidentally lied to you I
58:12 told my kid that once she's still kind
58:13 of rolled her eyes cuz she has a degree
58:15 in science and she's like I believe your
58:17 thing I think she'll get there but right
58:20 now she's still in the pop science world
58:22 because she's in a division of science
58:24 that works because it works it's
58:28 chemistry it works the way it works and
58:30 she doesn't need to know about the
58:32 fundamentals because the basics get the
58:34 job done that's good she's not lying to
58:38 kids that's a good thing so what I just
58:41 want to make sure you guys understand is
58:43 like I am now I have gone from 27 years
58:51 of frustration to probably five years of
58:55 utter relief and euphoria that finally
59:00 it all came together am I the only the
59:04 only angst I still have is not you guys
59:06 disagreeing with me or anything like
59:07 that that's just fine no problem at all
59:09 what gets to me is that I was lied to as
59:15 a child by modern science that's what
59:19 bothers me the most that I wasted so
59:22 many years off on some tangent and I
59:26 didn't just have someone go like you
59:29 know I never really got to the unified
59:31 theory thing with my uncle he may have
59:32 just said well you know some people
59:33 think ether existed you should check
59:35 that out and then it would have been oh
59:36 yeah okay I'll check that out and then
59:38 poof maybe it would have happened
59:40 sometimes we do need to go through
59:43 journeys of negatives before we can see
59:45 positives
59:45 just like Tyrell said to Deckard and
59:48 Blade Runner I want to see a negative
59:51 before I provide you with a positive
59:53 what'll that prove indulge me I guess
59:58 one of the analogies it could be that
60:02 every one of you could understand is
60:03 pick something in your mind that you
60:05 think you relied above even if you're
60:07 flat earther maybe you're a 911 person
60:11 and you're you became awake about those
60:16 particular
60:17 those particular factoids pick anything
60:22 where you woke up the next day and you
60:24 were frustrated that everyone around you
60:25 believed something that you thought was
60:28 wrong now it's a little tougher with
60:32 those two examples I just gave you
60:33 because we can't prove who did things
60:40 why they did things how we got things
60:42 you know misunderstood if you think the
60:45 world is flat and you think the globe
60:48 was a big lie then I understand you're
60:51 like god dammit we had this other way of
60:54 doing things for the majority of man's
60:56 time on earth and last 500 years yet all
60:59 mixed up into this globe thing I think
61:01 one of the things interesting about Flat
61:03 Earth is that we're all frustrated that
61:06 we can't go to space as much as they
61:10 tell us so there's gonna be a tourist
61:12 attraction on Mars or moon on the moon
61:16 or just orbiting in the ISS well those
61:22 tickets aren't going to be available to
61:23 us you know if we had a hundred thousand
61:27 dollars we may not choose to blow it on
61:30 that kind of trip first on whatever
61:32 one-week trip up into space who knows
61:34 right what blows my mind is that I'll
61:39 give you an analogy I'll give you my
61:41 thought and I'll give you an analogy
61:42 after that my thought is that it blows
61:46 my mind that something that was like
61:50 common knowledge and let's say 1880 has
61:54 been erased and now we sit here
61:58 struggling with this energy problem I
62:02 mean we got energy problems on all kinds
62:05 of levels we have inconvenience energy
62:07 issues which is like extension cords
62:10 [ __ ] my whole you know this is I got so
62:12 many cords right here to get this show
62:13 to happen that shouldn't even have to
62:15 exist but I got to use cords because
62:18 Tesla died and didn't you know figure
62:22 out how to do is transmitting
62:23 electricity theory when again his
62:26 laboratory as of Mark Twain's multiple
62:29 observations bartron must have went
62:31 laboratory like 20 times bringing all of
62:33 his friends to have shows by Tesla in
62:35 New York the dude said look there's no
62:38 wires in his entire laboratory but
62:40 everything's on in the ceilings lit but
62:42 there's no lights up there I don't see
62:43 any lights in the room but we're gonna
62:45 let room how the hell is this happening
62:48 that dude obviously mean some special
62:50 toys for himself so it's frustrating now
62:54 let me give you one you all agree with
62:58 me on we don't know how the pyramids
63:01 were built do we we don't know all
63:05 submitted theories or ludicrous
63:07 ridiculous and the ones that are
63:10 probably true are so fanciful that that
63:13 no one's gonna believe what we're
63:14 talking about you know perhaps again
63:18 there might have been a meridian tear in
63:20 the earth where those stones didn't
63:22 weigh as much back in those days
63:25 specifically limestone and granite red
63:27 granite may not have weighed so much
63:29 maybe the granite did the limestone
63:30 didn't maybe they had contraptions they
63:32 could put on the stones like the guy
63:34 Coral Castle it was taking 60 ton coral
63:38 stones off the back of a truck by
63:40 himself but no point has any person in
63:44 history this guy started building I
63:45 believe in 1905 or something like that
63:47 at no point in history did anyone say
63:51 they helped him get a stone off the back
63:52 of a truck they said we came the next
63:54 day and he would have us work with
63:56 pulleys to push it into place but he
64:01 took him off the back of the truck by
64:03 himself the guy was a hundred and ten
64:04 pounds three little kids or two little
64:07 kids saw him do it by turning the corner
64:10 on their bicycles they said he was using
64:12 these cone shape instruments to pull
64:15 them off the truck I don't know if
64:18 that's true but we don't have anyone
64:20 else saying anything else at all Wow
64:25 isn't that frustrating that there are
64:27 science out there that can do this
64:29 there's methodologies that can do this
64:31 well how many of you sci-fi buffs are
64:36 pissed off especially if you do a little
64:39 bit of research that we seem to have had
64:42 multiple universities around the world
64:44 having figured out how to accomplish
64:45 anti-gravity you know this Hutchison
64:48 effect that happens in Canada I think
64:49 that guys blow on everyone's mind it's
64:52 like well you know it sounds like he
64:53 just continued with the science of the
64:56 60s which was then erased about 65 they
65:01 don't teach it anymore than to talk
65:02 about anymore but I've got friends who
65:04 get visits by military people
65:06 ex-military people X and tell people and
65:08 they just brag at dinner about how
65:11 anti-gravity is just so advanced now
65:13 it's ridiculous
65:14 well don't you find that frustrating
65:17 wouldn't it be nice to be having you
65:20 know no more roads we don't have to
65:22 destroy the earth with pavement we don't
65:25 have to have any more bridges talk about
65:27 Auto driving cars it's just Blade Runner
65:29 it's Fifth Element they just fly
65:31 themselves there's lanes there's lanes
65:34 in 3d space you know I'm sure there'll
65:38 be some accidents whatever we got death
65:41 death you know matches on the highway
65:46 all the time people drive them crazy
65:48 people run away from cops killing
65:50 innocent people
65:51 imagine that [ __ ] just can't happen
65:53 anymore because you can't run away you
65:55 can't can't rob a bank and get away you
65:57 can't no well then our interest rates go
66:00 down because they don't have to cover
66:01 the loss of I don't know hundred million
66:03 dollars with the money annually that
66:05 gets ripped off out of little banks
66:06 around the world you know you want to go
66:09 see what the shape the world is hopin
66:12 you're anti-gravity amusement park right
66:14 and just go up about 80 miles and look
66:18 down holy crap it's a disc holy crap
66:21 it's a ball problem solved
66:24 if the 115 rumor of area of fairy 51 / S
66:29 4 from Lazar is true then we have force
66:32 fields and which would yield inertial
66:34 dampers meaning the ship could
66:37 technically speaking quarantine its
66:40 space on the ship haul ass at whatever
66:46 factor of warp at once and you know I
66:50 could have feel it inside you don't even
66:51 need to worry about being squashed that
66:53 means you can fly over the South Pole
66:55 there's no problem
66:57 you know for me again I think the way
67:01 I'm leaning in the in the Flat Earth
67:02 realm with things
67:03 a friend of mine said this great to me
67:06 in a little chat the other day she said
67:08 um she says well if it's flat then we're
67:13 in a matrix we're in something
67:15 completely bizarre that just merely
67:19 saying the shape is flat and it's a disk
67:22 so addresses nothing of the significance
67:25 of what that would actually be it would
67:27 be something way more powerful and we're
67:28 more significant and a lot of you
67:30 believe the same thing some of you think
67:32 again gods just on the other side
67:34 there's no other life in the universe
67:36 because we have to be the most special
67:38 thing that gods ever created amen I
67:42 think there's possum trying to crawl
67:44 down my fence over here oh it's a
67:46 raccoon check it out he's pretty special
67:49 to the plants that surround me are
67:51 special everything special probably took
67:55 an infinite amount of work to get it to
67:57 work this this wreck you doing but let's
68:01 say let me you know we dismiss a bit of
68:03 the power curve of what I'm talking
68:07 about as well which is let's say you
68:12 believe me we're an e throw based
68:14 universe you've reimagined the whole
68:17 thing gravity all of a sudden becomes a
68:19 push not a pull regardless of what shape
68:21 anything is you might be standing on the
68:24 way that it becomes powerful for you is
68:26 to you know if you were to take this
68:28 into research take this into invention
68:30 go look up Tesla Tower see how it works
68:33 I mean again there's videos online of
68:35 people that have taken Spears of metal
68:39 hung them in trees run to lead wires
68:41 down from it and touch the motor and it
68:44 runs it's using ether all conductivity
68:48 then you get out a Tesla coil and you
68:51 amplify the [ __ ] out of it
68:53 now what do you have do you have free
68:55 energy for your house it's not a
68:58 photoelectric effect if the Sun comes
69:01 out it probably stimulate a little bit
69:03 more like the Coral Castle said he
69:06 worked at 9:00 so you didn't have to
69:07 fight the Sun
69:08 maybe that provides a little little too
69:11 much chaos for his instruments to be
69:12 precise who knows he uprighted the
69:15 stones during the day but he always kept
69:18 two electrodes attached to the to the
69:20 stone as well little electric box on top
69:23 of his tripod of I think 10 by 10 you
69:28 know wood beams that held it up and the
69:33 box ran into his weird little magnetic
69:36 tourney thing inside of his warehouse I
69:39 said he never bought electricity from
69:40 the city who knows what's true right
69:43 again everything that they teach us in
69:46 science today with the capital S it it
69:51 restricts your thinking it closes your
69:53 mind from other opportunities from other
69:56 inventions especially anything that's
69:59 going to be free boy that's just forbid
70:01 knowledge isn't it because science
70:05 organizations live off this bizarre doom
70:07 and gloom model you get the doom and
70:12 gloom you know those stories in the news
70:14 constantly Oh black holes black holes as
70:17 if there's anything we could do about
70:18 one if one showed up you know it's
70:22 interesting how there's this it's a bit
70:25 of a digression but it'll give you a
70:27 correlation that you can just look up
70:30 any state or government agency that
70:33 needs its funding from the people they
70:35 want to make sure that the sentiment is
70:38 unanimous we must fund NASA we must fund
70:41 this and that they seem to have this
70:44 emergency that happens just before their
70:46 budgetary renewals and one of the
70:50 saddest ones has to do with fire
70:53 prevention states seem to have major
70:57 fires just before state funding for fire
71:02 prevention buying planes whatever to put
71:05 out fires needs to exist so there's this
71:07 bunch of fires typically burns down a
71:11 few hundred homes destroys thousands of
71:14 people's lives and they're like oh I got
71:16 our money good and then you don't see it
71:18 again for 10 20 years whenever that
71:19 budget runs out
71:21 then there's a bunch of fires again
71:22 bunch of new budget you know I don't
71:25 know what the California earthquake
71:27 funding cycle is but boy we get this
71:31 surge party pretty much every decade
71:34 we're out of thin air we get all these
71:37 articles dropped about how the big ones
71:39 coming the big ones coming and it's like
71:41 it never comes but then you know who
71:45 keeps going it's like look we don't need
71:47 a bunch of fear in in doom and gloom to
71:50 fund a fire prevention we don't need it
71:53 to fund earthquakes fires happen and we
71:56 want to be able to put them out without
71:58 losing you know a giant portion of
72:00 California State like just like we just
72:01 had right and we definitely have to
72:05 prevent earthquakes I mean we start we
72:07 have to detect them and and you know
72:09 create plans for when that kind of thing
72:12 occurs we don't need to be scared we
72:16 just have to have somebody say well this
72:18 is the tax we have to pay to make sure
72:20 that the best possible chance to survive
72:24 one of these cataclysmic events is in
72:26 place we're always developing new
72:28 instruments to find out the P and the S
72:30 wave and all that kind of stuff if
72:33 anything just run a documentary that
72:35 says well this is what could occur we're
72:36 not saying this is going to occur but
72:38 you know it's happened in 1905 was a
72:41 1908 or a 1905 whatever it was San
72:43 Francisco
72:44 we had the 74 in LA the 87 in LA the 90
72:49 89 in San Francisco in the 94 in LA
72:52 they're big and they're scary and you
72:55 know we have to do what we can we don't
73:01 need to be scared into it we're not
73:02 sheep there was a great post by Tim on
73:06 our Facebook page which I was shocked
73:08 and I was so proud of him he went out
73:12 and reached out to one of his buddies
73:13 who's a brilliant physicist and he said
73:15 you know what dude I've been looking at
73:18 this flattering thing and you know it
73:20 makes sense to me that a bunch of the
73:22 things that they said would happen if it
73:24 was on a ball don't seem to be happening
73:27 where we don't seem to feel these things
73:28 and he goes what is your take on this
73:30 and he listed a great breakdown of what
73:34 is
73:34 and said about the way that the earth
73:38 works and the way that gravity works and
73:40 with the atmosphere binds to the earth
73:42 and and the guy just said look it's
73:44 stupid that anyone thinks this thing is
73:46 flat and of course if that gentleman
73:49 knew he was addressing the whole
73:50 audience of deep thoughts he might have
73:52 picked a different word but it is tough
73:55 to change a paradigm once you learn the
73:57 science behind it or what have you I
73:59 have a soft spot for the Flat Earth
74:02 people because again I think that their
74:04 have the balls to question what has been
74:09 stated as the obvious it's just like my
74:13 teacher giving me an equals mc-squared
74:15 of course telling me Einstein invented
74:17 it which is the other big lie and me ask
74:20 you know me saying look what if it is in
74:24 a limiter again I interview my physics
74:27 teacher 20 years after class 21 years
74:31 after I took classroom I called him up
74:33 and he said to me I told you guys as
74:37 once before but it's sort of a way I
74:38 think this is why I have respect for
74:40 people to think differently because he
74:42 said look he goes you were one of my
74:47 best students and you're one of my
74:48 biggest pain in the asses because he
74:52 said first I would introduce something
74:54 to the class and ask if anybody knew
74:56 what I was talking about and he goes
74:58 you'd raise your hand and I didn't want
74:59 to pick you because he goes I knew you
75:01 would give me like the Encyclopedia
75:02 definition of what I'm about to talk
75:04 about which means if you're gonna argue
75:06 with me you're gonna be a pain in my ass
75:08 because you're not arguing from a dumb
75:10 standpoint you're arguing arguing from
75:12 having already read all this crap right
75:14 and then he mentioned that moment about
75:18 equals mc-squared and me questioning
75:20 speed of light and questioning more than
75:22 anything could go this be light and he
75:24 had a job to do which was to teach the
75:26 core theories and see you know get to
75:29 the next subject he just has a
75:30 curriculum he teaches period right but
75:33 in that call he's telling me he
75:34 respected me for doing that
75:36 he just as a teacher was taken off guard
75:40 and so that's what we have to do with
75:43 each other that's we have to do with the
75:45 world sometimes just take people off
75:46 guard
75:47 I just kind of go you know I'm an
75:49 thinking man it just doesn't make any
75:51 sense to me like if that's the case then
75:53 there's a bunch of missing science and
75:54 again what can you do about NASA if
75:58 that's the de facto proof of how
76:01 anything works that person who's relying
76:03 on that information is extremely screwed
76:08 extremely screwed I mean how many
76:10 pictures of the ISS do we have in space
76:12 with no stars it's just and there's no
76:16 explanation for it besides camera
76:18 aperture and it's like all right I might
76:21 I might go along with 1969 problems
76:24 maybe not really but not 2019 problems
76:28 from the ISS you mean you can't see the
76:30 milky way from the ISS and you can't
76:33 adjust the camera to see it it just
76:36 doesn't make any sense put a welding
76:37 mask in front of the camera and see if
76:38 you see the Milky Way something you know
76:41 change your aperture so anyway I wanted
76:44 to crank out this episode because I feel
76:47 like I still have people asking smart
76:49 questions about my my purpose for this
76:54 my feelings towards this this is not a
76:57 off-the-cuff journey for me this is a
77:01 journey I started at nine years old but
77:03 more specifically at the age of 19 I
77:08 absolutely devoted my life to it
77:10 I counted the years after I finished it
77:13 15 years putting into this pull gravity
77:16 model I was frustrated I felt conflicted
77:20 in my heart I feel like I was holding a
77:23 lie in my heart and I didn't have any
77:27 place to go to defuse it to replace it
77:31 with the truth you know it's like you
77:36 got I just trying to give a decent
77:37 analogy here it would almost be I
77:40 mentioned the jerk in my fourth season
77:44 review I'll mention another way of the
77:47 jerk the movie having a perfect analogy
77:49 for this when Steve Martin is playing
77:53 Nathan R Johnson and he lives in a house
77:56 full of you know beautiful black people
78:00 and he has his big mama he's played by
78:03 this wonderful actress ight and her
78:05 name's escapes me but it it was his
78:08 birthday I think even like a Twinkie and
78:11 like all of his favorite stuff and they
78:12 made him a ham sandwich or something cut
78:14 there
78:15 cut the crusts off or whatever it was
78:17 and he he's trying to accept the gift
78:20 and he finally just has a meltdown and
78:22 he goes in his room and he's crying and
78:24 his mother goes in there and she's being
78:27 real gentle with him and he's just like
78:28 I don't I just feel like I you know I
78:31 just don't blend in somehow you know and
78:33 she hugs him and starts kind of rocking
78:36 him in the bed and seeing him a little
78:37 bit of song and she says well I got it
78:40 you know have something to tell you you
78:41 know and he goes you know you're not
78:44 really our child and and he's like what
78:47 you know he's like he's obviously as
78:49 white as a ghost white guy and he had
78:54 that up he had that moment where he
78:55 broke down at his birthday because he
78:57 just was like something's not really not
78:59 so he's not right here he can't hold the
79:01 rhythm to their music he can't be like
79:05 them he doesn't feel black you know and
79:07 he was just struggling with that and
79:09 it's when she finally said well you're
79:11 actually white in some way shape or form
79:15 he was just like his I said what
79:17 happened was the radio played at night
79:19 and it was playing white music for the
79:21 first time and his feet were sticking at
79:23 the bottom of the sheets and he started
79:27 tapping his feet feet together he could
79:28 keep the beat - white music which was
79:30 like this really corny white music and
79:32 then he he starts snapping his finger to
79:34 his feet and then he crawls out I bet he
79:35 loses his feet rhythm but he still has
79:37 the snap in his finger and then he calls
79:39 the whole family and look at this man I
79:41 could finally keep breath emits this
79:43 music I can do it you notice cuz it was
79:45 white music for the first time the
79:47 [ __ ] scene is so brilliant man sort
79:50 of God so for me the white music playing
79:52 out of the radio was Eric Dollard
79:55 teaching me about ether I want you guys
79:57 to have that moment where he starts
80:00 snapping your fingers to the music and
80:02 you're like oh my god it finally makes
80:03 sense curbing locks together
80:05 there's no solve all the problems that
80:07 we're dealing with shape of the earth
80:09 all that kind of stuff the validity of
80:10 validity of NASA excite researcher
80:13 but it's a start I sometimes wonder as a
80:18 fundamental question of humanity you
80:22 know we talked about frequencies of
80:24 truth and frequencies of lies we talked
80:27 about good and we talked about evil I
80:30 don't think it's a big stretch to assert
80:33 that a person who is full of good is
80:36 full of more truth than lies and a
80:39 person who gets stuck in evil circles in
80:41 life whether they voluntary the evil in
80:44 their heart or whether they're not
80:45 they're just surrounded by it and then
80:46 become it that they would be full of
80:48 more lies so imagine this imagine that
80:54 you are a creature of God slash an
80:57 atheist I suggest you a creature of the
80:59 universe and because like suggested in
81:03 altered states all all information is a
81:07 kinetic result of previous kinetic
81:10 results that you do know the truth of
81:13 all things you do and the more that
81:19 people lie to you in a way that you take
81:22 it inside your heart is truth Big Bang
81:25 Theory's Dark Matter theories black hole
81:28 theories and all kinds of theories
81:31 sociological theories racism theories
81:35 you become full of lies and you become
81:38 full of then thus evil talk about matter
81:43 and antimatter no one's not good and
81:46 one's bad but let's just say evil is the
81:50 antimatter to the matter which is truth
81:55 if you carry these algorithms in you
81:58 what happens when something's vibrating
82:01 around you it vibrates you to it's
82:03 frequency if there's more of it than a
82:05 view like I always tell you you want to
82:08 relax a tense world go jump in a lake
82:12 just get off the get off on the shore
82:15 set on a noodle get your favorite
82:17 beverage and chill with your friends
82:19 play soothing music to yourself good
82:21 conversations with your friends at a
82:23 lake and the lake is surrounding you to
82:25 your neck
82:26 and believe me the water is going to win
82:29 the frequency battle with you but you
82:33 hop out of that lake and you feel good
82:34 for a few days you feel relaxed and you
82:36 get back to the push push push world of
82:38 lies and you become the darkness that
82:44 you are trying to shed now what's
82:49 interesting about Flat Earth is that
82:52 perhaps one of the reasons why it is one
82:55 of the most significant phenomenons on
82:58 the Internet in terms of wow that's a
83:01 big change it might simply be that you
83:05 are sensing the lies of all the pop
83:08 science around where we are how things
83:11 work organizations like NASA and your
83:16 body is sort of puking these lies out
83:20 but the problem is you want to fill that
83:24 void with truth and no one's got any or
83:29 you might have it and you don't know its
83:31 truth perhaps you feel like what you
83:35 have substituted is more truthful than
83:38 what you have previously believed that's
83:42 why I have a sympathy for anyone
83:44 struggling to become unified in a theory
83:48 of truth and goodness you're trying what
83:52 else can you do men and you know Yoda
83:54 says there's no such thing as try but
83:57 when you are trying to hit when you were
83:59 attempting to grab information and
84:01 validate it when there's no authority
84:03 above you to give you reliable
84:06 information it does feel like a try it'd
84:11 be nice if we had a little red light
84:13 green lights where you bring it in it's
84:15 red
84:16 push it out it's not true bring it as
84:17 green Oh poof feel better today how many
84:20 how many green lights did you get today
84:22 honey I got four how many red lights
84:24 yeah about eight but I didn't you know I
84:25 threw him out there and the old pile of
84:27 [ __ ] you know what a bob lazarre's
84:31 big reasons for coming out in 1889 was
84:36 that he said that there was a there was
84:38 two sides to the crime
84:40 of hiding these nine recovered
84:43 spacecraft and by the way I should say
84:45 if you haven't seen this episode on the
84:48 show on Netflix go see it they will be
84:51 on the same page when I cover the
84:52 episode in about two or three months
84:54 here but they asked them they said you
84:57 know do you think that this could be
84:59 created by our military and he just
85:02 immediately said no way no way if it's
85:06 been created by Earthlings it would have
85:09 been in a different time okay but no he
85:11 said no government no scientists on
85:13 earth knows how this stuff was created
85:17 because he said they have access to
85:18 every human on planet Earth and he goes
85:20 they brought me and because the project
85:22 had stalled and they needed a disrupter
85:24 to throw some other theories around to
85:28 get them over the next hump you know
85:30 they said the two crimes that he thought
85:32 were being committed against humanity
85:33 was one letting people know that there
85:36 are other civilizations in the universe
85:39 in solar systems very far away I don't
85:44 know how far away was he doesn't know
85:46 either but he said the technology that's
85:50 being discovered is also being coveted
85:52 and so he thinks that's a crime and if
85:58 you can only bring in scientists that
85:59 could have that can clear majestic level
86:02 security then you're obviously missing a
86:05 lot of scientists that could probably
86:07 solve some of these problems if not all
86:09 of them maybe the manufacturing
86:12 anomalies and he said while they work
86:15 but he worked for them he said there
86:17 were soldiers that walked around yelling
86:18 at everybody in a rhythmatic way that he
86:21 thought was perhaps a hypnotic
86:23 methodology because it didn't really
86:25 erase much of the details that I saw but
86:27 he did use some hypnosis of his own to
86:30 recall some of the details whoever would
86:34 have thought the truth would be so
86:37 difficult to discern to discover to
86:41 evaluate and validate and certify
86:44 whoever thought that we would be on this
86:49 planet
86:50 however we got here
86:52 and that we would have human beings that
86:54 would covet that's why it's one of the
86:58 Ten Commandments right to hide into a
87:01 secret society or a secret organization
87:05 claiming some national security
87:08 situation because there are evil people
87:11 out there you know we cover this in the
87:13 space travel episode it makes me wonder
87:16 if this s4 place really exists which is
87:21 supposed to be inside of a mountainside
87:23 with doors that are shaped like the
87:25 mountain that it's stuck in and they're
87:28 actually covered with dirt and sand so
87:30 you from a satellite picture you don't
87:32 see it but it makes you wonder if they
87:34 completely stalled I mean they
87:36 completely stalled every human being
87:38 they're allowed that they allow in there
87:41 that can pass all this security would
87:45 they just give up and leave it in the
87:48 warehouse and say well we can't have it
87:53 so no one else can have it like a child
87:55 with the toy you know that works right
87:58 ten toys in the room it's you're
88:01 visiting your friend's house they're
88:03 technically all his toys he's picked out
88:06 probably the dopest toys in the whole
88:08 room he's playing with it and then you
88:10 find a way to make one of the sub ties
88:13 interesting you make a sound with it or
88:16 whatever you're putting two things
88:17 together and you have a scenario going
88:19 he doesn't have one going because he's
88:20 not very creative
88:21 of course the [ __ ] kid goes over
88:24 there and takes them out of your hands
88:25 well I'm gonna play with that now
88:27 and you're like okay well I'll take the
88:29 cool thing you were playing with no
88:30 that's mine too it eventually just gets
88:32 the point the kid has a [ __ ] meltdown
88:34 because he's a [ __ ] and he doesn't
88:35 want you to play with any of his toys
88:37 and then his parent has to come in and
88:39 scold him if they're decent parents see
88:41 you're gonna share or we're gonna public
88:43 the toys away we're gonna take him and
88:45 give him to this kid he can take them
88:47 all home cuz you're a little [ __ ]
88:48 that'd be a good parent would that be
88:52 would that be a scenario that they would
88:54 do obviously if these were recovered
88:59 anywhere around 1947 and the one thing
89:02 he didn't say in the documentary which
89:03 I've heard him say
89:05 in every other public appearance was
89:07 that he said only one of these things
89:09 was for Steen and the other eight had
89:12 damage on them you didn't say that
89:14 documentary but if it's been from 1947
89:19 to 1989 I mean let's hope they made some
89:21 progress in last thirty plus years
89:23 wouldn't the world be a different place
89:25 if they'd figured some of this stuff out
89:28 wouldn't we have traveled to their
89:30 planet perhaps found the navigational
89:33 system who knows and I understand
89:36 because I went down this path heavily
89:37 and I talk about this every time I talk
89:39 about the subject since I got about half
89:41 an inch more on my cigar here I went
89:44 down the complete theory of all UFOs are
89:49 [ __ ] it's a fake out by the military
89:53 to give the impression that somehow the
89:55 United States of America is only once
89:57 ever recovered a UFO and all the other
89:59 countries should fear us because we have
90:01 this SuperDuper technology I went down
90:04 that theory I did then I did my roswell
90:08 research and it changed my mind big time
90:12 those Lazar interview this last one that
90:17 he just did he's an HD man I'm so proud
90:20 of him for sharing his time with us I
90:22 mean I can't even tell you how much I'd
90:23 love to interview that guy with respect
90:25 you know I wouldn't even waste time with
90:28 this guy this guy did this document or
90:30 did a fabulous job don't get me wrong
90:31 but he had to I'm sure that because
90:36 nobody knows who bob is and the mass
90:38 audiences that Netflix serves that he
90:41 felt the need to at least waste 20% of
90:44 the interview time with Bob you know he
90:47 believes in Bob I think but he he had to
90:50 pose all of the anti belief questions
90:53 and I understand that I wouldn't waste
90:54 any time with that I didn't wasting time
90:58 with that with bart sibrel he was the
91:00 one that addressed the disbelievers I
91:02 let him do that because I that I
91:06 100,000% think we didn't go to the moon
91:08 based on the people I've talked to and
91:10 the two guys from NASA that broke the
91:11 story to me so anyway this is gonna be a
91:15 little bonus in the summer of 2019
91:18 I talked about the website but I hadn't
91:23 done any recordings after I've actually
91:24 modified the website so let me just give
91:26 you a little update of what happened
91:27 there probably one of the most
91:31 entertaining ways to discover deep
91:34 thoughts radio is to go to deep thoughts
91:35 radio comm nowadays as of late June 2019
91:39 I found a really fantastic theme in
91:44 WordPress
91:45 it's basic but it's very functional I
91:47 converted all of the posts to the new
91:49 Guttenberg block system so the embeds of
91:53 the movies work perfectly I discovered
91:56 that I had lost all of my season 2
92:00 thumbnails which I don't even know how
92:02 that's possible somehow I deleted the
92:04 folder yours truly can be a genius
92:06 sometimes but I have to say I never
92:09 liked the thumbnail for season 2 ever I
92:12 thought it looked like [ __ ]
92:13 it was puffing a cigar just looks stupid
92:16 and so I created a brand new thumbnail
92:18 for season 2 and regenerated a hundred
92:20 and five thumbnails and had to upload
92:23 them in two different locations on on
92:25 YouTube and went on the WordPress
92:27 website but what I did and what I am
92:31 still cleaning up are the categories on
92:33 the website because there's two
92:34 different category systems there's a
92:35 category system that turns into a
92:37 playlist on YouTube and there's a
92:40 category system on the website the one
92:43 on YouTube is more accurate the one on
92:45 WordPress is still catching up but let's
92:47 just say you're like look I like alien
92:49 conversations I don't like any of your
92:50 other episodes so go to the website if
92:52 you're on mobile you gotta scroll past
92:54 the thumbnails and then the category
92:55 sections are down below but you just
92:57 click on the alien category and boom all
92:59 the alien videos are right there for you
93:01 a flat earth out of 438 episodes on this
93:06 show not all of them are public to you
93:09 guys but probably four hundred and
93:10 thirty are I've only done 16 episodes
93:13 dedicated to flutter earth for anybody
93:15 who accuses me of obsessing but it's
93:17 quick and it now has a search field I
93:19 can't believe I didn't have a search
93:21 field on a previous template that's so
93:23 bad of me also too for those of you who
93:26 are trying to click the RSS feed link
93:29 the if you just scroll down
93:31 pass the first videos or if you're on a
93:34 desktop it's right there in your face
93:35 but if you're on your mobile device
93:36 which is where you would probably have
93:37 your podcast listener just scroll down
93:40 there's an Android link that works
93:42 beautifully with your phone it's amazing
93:44 and then there's the the second generic
93:46 RSS feed one is for your iPhone it works
93:48 fantastic as well so definitely get into
93:52 that I have nearly every single season
93:56 one should I have all the numbered ones
93:59 finished one $2.99 there are some that
94:02 are missing because they've just been
94:03 simply turned off the cancer ones been
94:06 turned off there's a few others that I
94:07 just think lost their accuracy over time
94:11 not that many probably about four
94:13 there's a couple special reports one on
94:16 the Mendell effect and one on the prints
94:18 tributes that I haven't converted yet
94:19 which I'll get to and those will go into
94:22 the channel so that channel is pretty
94:24 much done now so you can get that link
94:26 off the navigation but all the
94:28 navigation is really easy for you so
94:29 it's beautiful for all of you on patreon
94:33 that keep hanging on even though the
94:34 show is not active thank you so much
94:37 because you're gonna be on hold for
94:39 about a month and a half so I've already
94:43 started the engines it took me three
94:45 days to do the website and I'm talking
94:46 twelve hour days boy it was not fun so
94:50 yeah but so now I'm incubating five what
94:53 it's gonna be about what its gonna look
94:55 like says all kinds of cool things I
94:57 hope to accomplish before it's over but
95:00 again for joining the show at any point
95:02 in time one the newcomers welcome aboard
95:05 for those of you stuck on forever hey
