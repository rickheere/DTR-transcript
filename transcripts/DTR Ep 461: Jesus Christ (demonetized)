00:29 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:31 deep thoughts we're getting another warm
00:34 day episode here hopefully this thing
00:38 stays focused on my face this time so as
00:43 you can see if we're gonna take on the
00:44 very controversial subject of Jesus
00:48 Christ and believing in him and there's
00:54 still gonna be a very specific exercise
00:56 in his existence but I think too at the
01:01 same time you're watching this episode
01:02 you may just want to take a step back
01:05 and think about a lot of things that we
01:09 believe in because it it fills a gap now
01:13 before I begin because this is so touchy
01:16 and this is literally religion I want to
01:21 make it clear that you know I want to
01:25 have family and friends who absolutely
01:28 devoutly believe in Jesus Christ's
01:31 existence and I have nothing against
01:33 that at all
01:34 it doesn't mean that when you hear my
01:36 opinion of it you won't hear a little
01:38 bit of perhaps sarcasm here and there or
01:42 dislike a shock that people still
01:45 believe it but that's because i'm giving
01:46 you my raw perspective of how i
01:48 interpret that entire storyline and it's
01:54 just it's really no different than
01:55 someone saying they like obama over
01:57 Trump or Trump over Obama everybody on
02:00 the other side looks at the other side
02:01 goes my god how the hell do you do that
02:03 you know that other dudes evil but still
02:07 you can go off and eat a cheeseburger
02:08 together you can be family friends you
02:10 can be brother and sister mother father
02:12 and get along and every other part of
02:14 the conversation so I want to I want to
02:16 encourage that sort of tolerance if you
02:19 will if you'll write me a little bit of
02:20 a blank check as I go through this
02:23 because I was raised in Christianity
02:25 raising the Catholic Church until I was
02:27 eight then my parents moved away from
02:30 the Catholic Church and then I didn't
02:31 have to go to any church then I bounced
02:34 around a little bit came back and around
02:36 a c15
02:39 16 I got re-exposed to Catholic Church
02:43 because my girlfriend was getting
02:44 confirmed and I believe I did too
02:47 I don't even know how it's possible then
02:50 move to California Dan just before my
02:53 19th birthday a couple months before my
02:55 19th birthday I got into the
02:56 non-denominational Church of Christ so
02:59 you've heard the story more times than
03:01 you want to admit and then I spent
03:04 three-and-a-half super-amazing years in
03:09 this religion of Christianity just
03:12 studying it I'd never really got into
03:14 the Bible much you know I the only thing
03:16 I knew was that was really Old Testament
03:18 stuff and maybe I knew that someone
03:20 could crucified but I didn't know what
03:23 chapter colon verse meant I didn't know
03:26 what those numbers meant looked look
03:27 alien to me but I spent months and
03:30 months you know a different Bible study
03:31 sir you know researching New Testament
03:35 Old Testament you know Genesis all that
03:38 Matthew Mark Luke John and how they were
03:40 all written for different audiences etc
03:42 and what was really interesting about it
03:45 was that it never occurred to me till
03:48 much later that the guy in my opinion
03:54 Bobby Bobby say a different way that he
03:57 may not have existed at all right we
04:01 don't we don't get that option too much
04:03 in this world if you're raised in a
04:06 Christian based country like America
04:09 they not they never it just doesn't come
04:10 up you will almost never ever hear the
04:13 words that person is complete fiction
04:17 never ever existed as the church bells
04:21 go off in that distance but here's what
04:24 I think is one of the fundamental
04:26 problems for people to get to the point
04:29 they can even contemplate that really
04:31 it's like it's like a scientific
04:32 question perhaps a historical question
04:37 because what an average American
04:40 believes is that if either you believe
04:42 in Jesus Christ or you're an atheist and
04:45 so they hang on to Jesus because they
04:48 feel this they feel this amazing power
04:50 from the universe they feel things and
04:52 they
04:52 they know just instinctively there's
04:54 something else going on but no one's
04:56 offering any other paradigms so it's got
04:59 to be Jesus well I'm just gonna I don't
05:00 have time to create a brand new Jesus
05:02 I'm gonna keep the one that's been put
05:04 on the books for me and never oughta not
05:05 hurting anybody and that's absolutely
05:07 right but let me offer you some more
05:10 options because it isn't that cut and
05:13 dry in my experience so an atheist is
05:17 like your complete blasphemous person
05:20 according to Christian religion which is
05:22 you deny any existence of any
05:24 intelligent life anywhere in the
05:26 universe we are just inanimate matter
05:29 that has gained consciousness that has
05:31 gained love and we are we are something
05:34 spawned from nothing big bang mess and
05:40 so we're special but only on a
05:42 scientific thing and honestly once they
05:44 find out and start doing math on how
05:46 many stars and planets they think it
05:48 might be out there then we become
05:50 insignificant again so he just can't win
05:53 with atheists it's funny when I lived in
05:56 the Bay are sorry when I lived in
05:57 Southern California before in northern
05:58 Cal much is Ventura County there was a
06:02 radio station I used to listen to when I
06:04 Drive drove to work and it had an
06:06 atheist program on it and went for a
06:09 couple hours I was never in the car that
06:11 long but I remember hearing just the
06:13 hatred and the anger of atheists towards
06:16 anyone who believed anything else I
06:19 thought if that's how unhappy you get
06:22 being an atheist I don't have anything
06:24 to do with that so here's what I have
06:29 discovered in my 50 years of being on
06:32 this planet you have the story of Christ
06:36 for Christians and you have atheism
06:39 which means you believe in literally
06:41 lumps of dirt you know really it's an
06:46 absence of any belief the amazing
06:49 conservation of energy isn't it I
06:50 believe in nothing now on the other side
06:55 of Christ it was because we're gonna
06:56 kind of keep a ledger here as a belief
06:59 side and at least sign a non belief side
07:01 right but there's God that could be
07:05 easily separated from
07:06 Jesus the story of Christ combines the
07:09 story of God it says that's the father
07:12 but the meat just say this if you're
07:16 looking at religion you're saying well I
07:18 don't know if Christ existed or not I
07:20 wasn't there a lot of the you know stuff
07:25 that's being dug up you know old stories
07:27 of Christ like virgin births are in
07:30 Egyptian hieroglyphs for God's sake it's
07:34 in Babylonian texts it's in a bunch of
07:36 little tiny stories along the way cou
07:39 Colin from Ireland is a virgin birth
07:41 save the Irish people thing there's tons
07:45 of them
07:45 again I have a book of my house that I
07:48 believe has 23 different virgin birth
07:52 stories documented and since that book
07:54 was written 25 years ago at least when I
07:57 got it 25 years ago there's been four
08:00 additional stories but perhaps if you
08:05 are saying I'm hanging on to Jesus
08:07 because I feel something you might just
08:10 be feeling a central consciousness of
08:13 the universe which we could call God or
08:15 you could call the universe and again
08:18 there's a lot of models for what that
08:20 could be
08:21 now is there something in between is
08:23 there something in between being a
08:26 full-on atheist and being a full-on
08:28 religious person of some sort /
08:30 believing in a central consciousness
08:31 which could simply be a very scientific
08:33 thing it could be like a central CPU of
08:36 some sort right well there's something
08:39 could we call agnostic agnostic means
08:43 you're not sure you could even have one
08:47 Stefan atheist beliefs two steps in some
08:52 sort of divine belief but you still
08:54 don't know and so when you were asked
08:56 what you believe you just say I'm
08:59 agnostic I don't know I've all be happy
09:02 to find out when I get there all right I
09:06 think because people don't see God as a
09:10 potential belief system by himself
09:13 how many as he because it's just the
09:18 most popular way to say it
09:20 but because people don't have
09:21 alternatives they gravitate to Christ
09:23 because they don't want to lose out now
09:25 what are they worried about the
09:27 interesting thing I find out is that the
09:30 most calm cerebral intellectual people
09:33 that I know if they have any belief
09:35 system at all it is usually of the
09:37 universe and not of a particular deity
09:40 like Christ or someone and they're just
09:43 totally chill with that man it's like a
09:46 it's like a Buddhist chant it's
09:47 everyone's feeling good you get this
09:51 hair out of my face but the ones that
09:54 really stick to the Jesus metaphor our
09:57 idea story is that they fear going to
10:03 hell and for them
10:06 keeping it Jesus and not just God
10:09 addresses they're indoctrinated fear of
10:12 someone having told them the story about
10:13 the fire and brimstone well if you
10:16 really believe that that would be
10:18 utterly horrifying wouldn't it someone
10:20 some human being told you a story that a
10:25 human being wrote that human being made
10:27 up that you are going to rot in hell I
10:31 mean it's as old as the books we had
10:33 society at some point completely utterly
10:36 out of control and we had to keep
10:38 everybody in control at some point I
10:39 mean you know stop killing everybody
10:40 would you and we use these stories to
10:45 get everybody in check well you know
10:46 what happens if you're bad what happens
10:48 you know you go to a fiery pit you like
10:51 the way fire feels or no and you like
10:53 the guy's hand on fire oh [ __ ] you know
10:55 and it's like yeah now you're gonna
10:56 behave right you hope okay that's where
11:00 that stuff starts it's just completely
11:01 organic and it's pure society trying to
11:04 control society okay but let's let's go
11:09 straight at it is this this episodes
11:11 about Jesus Christ it's not about the
11:13 Old Testament now I hope that you can
11:16 reflect back on the New Testament after
11:18 we talk about Jesus and realize all the
11:22 supplies to the stories prior you know
11:26 Moses and Noah all those fanciful
11:30 stories Adam and Eve
11:32 so the story goes is that the Old
11:37 Testament is around for quite a few
11:40 years and it is the way you are supposed
11:44 to behave otherwise you're going to be
11:47 in violation of God and there's hell to
11:50 pay and they sold us this notion of
11:55 original sin way back in the day and you
11:59 have to understand that the control
12:00 mechanism before Christ was that priests
12:03 operated in these temples which are
12:06 usually these square buildings that have
12:07 inner chambers and inner chambers and
12:09 inner chambers and again they had
12:12 massive control this is the time when
12:17 you pay down to Caesar because there was
12:19 a there was a spear at your neck if you
12:22 didn't pay there's a lot of God worship
12:25 there was idols there were there were
12:27 idols where you would have an idol for
12:29 fertility an idol for your crop an idol
12:32 for whatever but everyone believed in
12:35 this original sin thing who was into any
12:37 religion whatsoever meaning you born
12:40 with sin and then you send sin since and
12:42 throughout the throughout the days and
12:45 it's a much tougher world so imagine the
12:46 ease of sinning back in those days it
12:49 would be I would think pretty easy to to
12:53 to do things you mean you have law
12:55 that's relative to various areas but the
12:59 idea was is that you have to get
13:02 forgiven for your sins and the way they
13:06 orchestrated it was that they would
13:07 slaughter a lamb a virgin a symbol of
13:11 virginity a symbol of purity offering
13:16 the Lambs body and the Lambs blood to
13:19 God as a sacrifice which I mean could
13:25 you think of anything more satanic than
13:27 that right a bunch of people commit sins
13:31 the scum of the earth which is us commit
13:34 a bunch of sins and then you take
13:35 something pure and in order to offer it
13:38 to God you murder it you put it through
13:42 torture you stick a little spike in his
13:45 throat and it's
13:46 not all over this altar which thing goes
13:48 down into these troughs this is very
13:50 specific and these troughs were dug
13:52 underneath like a rangering all the
13:54 walls if you had like a two chamber
13:57 temple because it's a small town it goes
14:00 underneath two walls if you had eight
14:01 chambers because it's a big city
14:03 structure it goes all the way out to the
14:06 streets and they could cut these in for
14:08 you know different troughs look like a
14:11 plus sign Red Cross and it spills out
14:15 into the streets seems to me to be for
14:18 you fairly satanic right you have to
14:19 hurt the innocent to forgive the sins of
14:22 the sinners right it seems like you
14:24 should sacrifice yourself if that's what
14:27 you're trying to fix but you know kooky
14:29 ass old-world thing this did occur but
14:33 as the blood spilled into the street the
14:36 people were recorded as always being
14:38 celebratory screaming yay cuz I could
14:41 see it okay so this went on for
14:46 thousands of years until one day God in
14:53 His infinite wisdom having waited awhile
14:56 for this to start right because he he
14:59 needed to have a broken way to do it
15:02 first and let that go for a little while
15:04 and then he was like you know I really
15:07 dig lambs they're pretty cool and this
15:10 problem was getting really messy and the
15:12 more people that exists the more temples
15:15 they build the more lambs they slaughter
15:17 and oh my god it's just really it's just
15:19 gross and creepy and weird I'm I know
15:22 what I'm gonna do to fix this problem
15:24 now we never talked about that in sexual
15:26 moment right that there's God up there
15:30 according to the Old Testament and
15:32 according to almost the entire Bible
15:35 he's not very perfect me really isn't
15:39 right he gets surprised and angry all
15:42 the time and kills people and has people
15:44 nearly kill their children to prove that
15:49 they believe in him I mean that's just
15:50 kooky sits around making bets with the
15:53 devil on job's life I mean which I guess
15:58 some case
15:59 okay recently said you know how they
16:02 really said his name back in the day I'm
16:04 like what fairytale man job they
16:08 actually called him job back in the day
16:10 and this like and you feel like you have
16:13 just knocked it out of the park don't
16:15 you buddy
16:16 loose beliefs is what I typically run
16:19 into someone's like yeah well you know I
16:21 grew up with it so yeah you know I
16:22 haven't put any I don't wanna put any
16:23 thought into it to not think about it
16:25 now there's value in this whole thing
16:28 we're gonna bumper this whole the second
16:30 half of this is gonna be the value of
16:31 believing in something like this and
16:33 distilling from it very important things
16:36 right but yeah God makes I don't know I
16:41 don't know if you could construe his
16:44 anger killing things like resetting the
16:49 world with Noah having to have Moses
16:54 bring down Ten Commandments the whole
16:57 issue of Sodom and Gomorrah all these
17:01 things you would have to say that those
17:04 are all mistakes all mistakes
17:09 now some people be like no man there's
17:12 God teaching you how the world could
17:14 work man you know what he doesn't have
17:16 to kill the whole playing it off with
17:18 floods they'd have to turn everyone into
17:21 isn't it wasn't the bomb a city and
17:24 turning some dudes wife into a pillar of
17:26 salt doesn't have to torture a child's
17:31 entire image of the universe by having
17:33 his father put a knife to his throat
17:35 that kid screwed up for life
17:37 right so God is this mega flawed thing
17:42 because man wrote it okay but there's
17:45 this churn of heart he's gonna create a
17:49 son and he's not gonna have one son this
17:51 is what's super important to Christians
17:53 I think it's one kid as if somehow the
17:56 story has less impact if God had twenty
18:02 thousand billion kajillion kids and he
18:04 just happened to send hey Seuss down to
18:07 get murdered by human beings I don't see
18:11 any difference in the
18:13 Packt if this was a true story and him
18:15 having infinite kids and him having one
18:16 kid that emphasis for me sounds very
18:20 man-made and he still would be the only
18:22 one that perhaps came down here and I
18:24 know people are shot at the camera we're
18:26 all children of God and I would I would
18:28 agree with you so he inserts his little
18:35 seedling into Mary it's not quite clear
18:37 whether or not Mary donated an egg or
18:39 not but whether or not he just was a
18:42 Humpty Dumpty all by himself and you
18:46 know like Sam Kinison had a amazing
18:48 routine about his father finding out
18:52 that the mother Mary got pregnant she
18:55 says well how did this happen well I was
18:58 just walking through the garden and then
19:00 oh my god I got pregnant he's like he
19:03 was just talking about how you wasn't
19:05 have any more walking through the garden
19:06 moments but it's very important that
19:09 there's a virgin birth because then you
19:12 could say look there is no father
19:14 that's human this character had no human
19:17 contribution whatsoever now we'll just
19:20 overlook the fact that they probably
19:21 still had sex until she found out she
19:23 was pregnant that's a little odd to
19:27 think about but Jesus is born and of
19:31 course he goes through the standard
19:33 archetype of one of these characters
19:35 he's a little pride you kid you know
19:37 he's teaching the preacher's and the
19:40 rabbi's at the time all about the law he
19:43 knew everything just from birth that
19:45 kind of stuff because he's got to be
19:46 made to be divine and then there's this
19:47 giant loss of his history before he
19:51 shows up to to take the stage and then
19:56 Christ when he finally activates his
19:58 mutant powers it's it and I don't know
20:03 why he had to be in his late 20s early
20:06 30s to pull this off I mean that was
20:09 pretty much a middle-aged man at the
20:11 time of his of his era in fact his era
20:15 of the zero ADEs is supposed to be
20:20 especially in the Mediterranean region
20:21 of the world is supposed to be one of
20:24 the times when the average lifespan for
20:26 me
20:26 was about 36 years old because of the
20:29 hardships of life so in that particular
20:33 case he's like an old guy throwing down
20:36 he did have rock-hard abs though now
20:40 let's just pause for a second before he
20:42 goes through all of his cycles of trying
20:44 to teach the public and he's only
20:46 teaching the public around the
20:47 Mediterranean which is interesting right
20:49 but he speaks in parables and his
20:51 parables as are as ancient as man
20:54 himself
20:55 meaning prodigal son and and a lot of
20:59 his stories came out of Egyptian
21:00 hieroglyphs he didn't necessarily see
21:03 them because everybody knew them and
21:05 everybody told them and I'm willing to
21:07 bet you know a penny saved is a penny
21:10 earned
21:11 everybody knew those things and so who
21:13 knows we're supposedly extremely
21:17 ignorant in his timeframe but if you
21:19 look at Rome and the construction that
21:21 had gone on and Greece and the
21:23 construction that go huntin and Egypt
21:25 and the construction that had gone on
21:27 we're not exactly as stupid as it may
21:29 sound
21:30 were calculating models of the universe
21:34 using the Pythagoras theorem we are
21:36 improving structural integrity by by
21:39 continuing to refine our materials so we
21:41 can move columns further and further
21:43 apart in in you know beautiful Athens
21:47 creations right the Colosseum is built
21:51 prior to his existence by titus flavius
21:54 so the portrayal of his pilgrimage
21:57 through this timeframe is a little
21:59 skewed in that we are sitting in a
22:01 middle of a very modern world just a
22:05 couple thousand years ago and then of
22:07 course he bucks the system but he still
22:13 says pay on the Caesar what is Caesar's
22:16 it's a fascinating little important
22:18 tidbit because I don't think God really
22:20 cares about Caesar that much what was
22:24 the purpose of Christ's coming down to
22:27 earth well I've heard all kinds of wild
22:31 stuff but the most important one is that
22:33 whole lamb sacrificing thing at the
22:35 temple ends soon as Christ dies on that
22:38 cross
22:39 and then is put down and then awakes and
22:43 then it sends to heaven he has taken
22:46 away all your sins with him no more need
22:50 to hurt lambs but secondly you can
22:55 continue to commit sins and you have to
22:57 replay yourself constantly to this
23:00 person and you have to go through man to
23:04 get to God after this point the Roman
23:07 Senate all turns into popes
23:09 all at the same time tons of popes
23:12 because the senate said I'm not gonna
23:15 lose any power to this new thing we're
23:16 creating right around the time of Christ
23:20 as I've said several times Rome is
23:22 losing all of its power they're
23:26 expanding too much there's not enough
23:27 legions to get taxes and so they create
23:30 this religion it's a turnkey system it's
23:34 like buying a Domino's Pizza today you
23:37 just sign up for pay your franchise fee
23:39 they ship all the stuff to you put the
23:41 sign out front they got the recipes
23:42 Cisco shows up to give you all the GMO
23:45 ingredients for your crappy food
23:46 there's your boxes fold them up get
23:48 going creating Christ at the time that
23:52 he was created was again just a turnkey
23:55 thing because everyone knew about all
23:57 these previous birth death resurrection
24:00 saviors from previous religions the only
24:03 difference was you didn't have one being
24:05 enforced by a Roman Empire meaning it's
24:09 now illegal to worship any of those old
24:12 ones in fact it might even been illegal
24:14 to talk about the old ones having
24:16 already created this story just to make
24:18 sure the Inquisition has its effect
24:20 which is the next nine hundred years of
24:21 humanity but what a Christ do that was
24:25 made him different well he walked on
24:30 water he turned water into wine he took
24:34 a little bit of bread and a little bit
24:35 of fish and made infinite bread and
24:37 infinite fish he waved his hands once
24:40 and a storm on the sea just stopped
24:43 he cast diseases out of man into pigs
24:48 that then drown themselves in water this
24:51 dude is
24:53 straight up a Marvel superhero and then
24:59 he has his buddies turn him in predicts
25:02 the future gets on across dies he's put
25:08 in a cave with an e rate raises up opens
25:11 a cave door he even brings a guy back
25:13 from the dead that's another amazing
25:14 thing and then he ascends to heaven he
25:18 tells you that the ritual you were
25:20 supposed to do is some crazy satanic
25:24 thing of eating his flesh and drinking
25:25 his blood something today that we think
25:28 the elite of the world do and it's
25:30 totally evil when they do it but us
25:32 reenacting this with bread and grape
25:36 juice is unbelievably wonderful the
25:44 Catholic Church which is the original
25:46 Church created by the Roman Empire is
25:49 its own sovereign country with what 25
25:52 foot tall fortress walls they have been
25:55 involved with every nefarious thing
25:57 since their creation they help launder
26:01 the money from the Nazis they have more
26:03 pedophilia on their back than any
26:04 institution on planet Earth and they
26:07 just finished their Viper Room in the
26:09 basement but after Christianity Rome got
26:14 another 1200 1300 years of rule because
26:20 no longer was there a problem I mean
26:22 there was a problem for 900 years which
26:23 we'll get to but there wasn't really as
26:24 much of a problem collecting taxes
26:26 because anyone who bought the story said
26:28 well Jesus said give unto Rome what is
26:31 Rome it's going to Caesar what is
26:33 Caesar's right let's just do it it's
26:35 what God wants God wants to make Caesar
26:38 rich whoever is the Caesar seems so real
26:43 doesn't it so eventually all these
26:46 senators who invented this entire
26:49 religion based off titus flavius his
26:51 life
26:52 remember titus flavius his life is
26:54 documented in marble jesus's life we
26:59 don't even know yet what the first text
27:00 was but it definitely didn't show up for
27:02 350 years after his fabled existence
27:07 and then we just look at everything they
27:09 said it happened to Christ's life and we
27:11 look at Titus Flavius is life and
27:12 there's there's over forty five exact
27:16 metaphorical typology comparisons well
27:20 imagine that the flavia's family is the
27:22 richest most successful caesar to ever
27:26 reign over it created the colosseum i
27:28 mean this dude is like the dude that
27:30 took rome to the next level and they
27:33 want people to worship a guy as a god
27:36 but they know that if they just say
27:38 worship titus flavius and there'll be
27:41 some people that will do it but
27:42 eventually they're going to not do it
27:44 and so they create this fictional
27:46 version of him using typology which is
27:49 you know again you retell a story if
27:51 someone else's life but you just change
27:52 the names and locations and now when you
27:57 worship jesus you're worshiping titus
27:59 flavius it's his life not Christ's life
28:03 we're sitting here in 2019 now we're
28:06 gonna jump around quite a bit here and
28:09 if I said to you okay
28:10 you really believe that after 27
28:14 previous stories let's just say 26 26
28:17 previous stories that are exactly like
28:20 the story of Christ I mean virgin birth
28:23 dude saves his area
28:28 in fact statues made of Mary and Jesus
28:32 match statues in those previous stories
28:34 sculpted 4000 years before Christ ever
28:37 existed you really think that's real you
28:41 think that a dude walked on water and a
28:44 dude did this and a dude did them 2019
28:48 we're still buying that story we don't
28:51 see any of that behavior in the world by
28:52 the way right David Blaine can do it
28:55 Chris angel can do it you know as he
28:58 loads up the crowd with all of his own
29:00 actors that's entertainment
29:03 we like that we pay for that and then
29:08 the printing press comes along and I'll
29:11 be damned
29:12 no more Jesus Christ's ever show up the
29:16 cell phone is
29:18 incredibly muted you know Bigfoot
29:22 sightings UFO sightings now course
29:26 special effects art students are now
29:28 loading up you know moronic YouTube
29:33 channels with fake stuff but that's
29:36 entertainment I think most of us know
29:37 that senators had turned into Pope's
29:40 died and turned into Saints until it got
29:42 to a pyramid scheme of control the
29:48 people weren't buying it because people
29:49 were there and they're like there's no
29:51 one ever this didn't happen you know
29:55 people who lived in Rome or in the
29:57 surrounding areas who went to those you
30:00 know crucified crucifixions and tortures
30:04 entertainment centers right there like I
30:07 do from Nazareth it was tortured that
30:11 then I woke back up and and that that
30:14 rock right there you see that that's the
30:16 cave or Jesus you know it's like I live
30:18 right next to that place one it's not
30:20 even a cave and two no one ever was put
30:22 in it after a crucifixion who's this
30:25 chick Mary we know everybody in the area
30:27 because there's not that many people
30:29 people in Nazareth they're like who are
30:30 you talking about so they didn't believe
30:34 it because they were there and so they
30:38 hatched this thing to go oh crap well
30:42 we'll just make a belief we'll just make
30:45 them believe how do we do that well
30:46 we'll just torture everybody and freak
30:48 them out will terrorize humanity
30:51 terrorize humanity until they say they
30:53 believe but what if they don't believe
30:56 still well we'll kill them so for you
31:00 know three different segments of the the
31:03 Inquisition it got so bad it was like it
31:08 was like Nazi era stuff right if you
31:10 hear about anyone who doesn't believe in
31:11 this story of Christ report them the
31:15 Vatican will send mercenaries over to
31:17 torture and kill them if they admit they
31:19 believe in Christ that you get off but
31:22 you're gonna get tortured you're gonna
31:23 mess with your stuff is gonna get ripped
31:24 off and this is the first nearly
31:28 thousand years of the foundation of the
31:30 belief in Jesus cry
31:32 his torture murder the invention of the
31:37 mercenary which is the Vatican hiring an
31:40 outside firm slash soldiers to do their
31:43 dirty work so nothing comes back on the
31:45 Vatican they create a painting as during
31:50 the Michelangelo days so it's a little
31:52 much later but they created a painting
31:53 of the Pope giving our Tsar Jesus giving
31:57 the Pope a key and then ran the whole
31:59 local area through to see the painting
32:02 which for them was a photo real which
32:03 meant it was real falsifying this
32:07 authority being given from a fake person
32:10 named Jesus to this real person called
32:12 the Pope so that everybody said oh this
32:15 is so real well I'm glad I made the
32:17 right choice now and we'll go to hell
32:19 but now let's take a take a pit stop
32:22 here for one second and let's go over to
32:23 Santa Claus if I say to you okay you
32:29 believe in Jesus and you say absolutely
32:31 well why do you believe in Jesus I just
32:34 do were you raised to believe in Jesus
32:36 absolutely
32:37 all right what are your genetic odds of
32:40 not believing in something you were
32:41 raised to believe do you have a lot of
32:44 history of shaking off and doctrine
32:48 ation from when you were young if they
32:51 say yes it's a rare thing that they
32:53 would continue to believe this other
32:54 thing but do you believe in Santa Claus
32:58 no well why not well because I'm a
33:04 parent and you know I've never seen him
33:06 come in I have to buy all the Presidents
33:08 it doesn't work like that
33:10 so because you don't see him you don't
33:14 believe in him no we know that was it
33:18 was the journalist and the eighteen
33:20 hundred's made him up and died at the
33:21 done it's okay we have more documented
33:27 evidence of the creation of Christ
33:28 through the flavia's family and dr. out
33:30 wells work then you have that Santa
33:34 Claus is fake and if Santa Claus not
33:37 showing up on Christmas Day is the
33:39 indication that that Santa Claus isn't
33:41 real
33:42 well that Jesus is fair
33:44 in real because that dude was supposed
33:46 to come back and he hasn't come back
33:49 here's a guy that used to come into the
33:51 lounge I've told the story once before
33:53 and he's massively arrogant with his
33:56 knowledge of religion especially
33:58 Christianity of course he's really old
34:01 too and he comes in dressed like a
34:03 teenager and he's just a weird dude but
34:06 he came in and he wants to argue with
34:09 anybody who doesn't believe in Jesus and
34:11 he wants to almost get to blows which my
34:14 god that'd be so much fun he he told me
34:19 once that because he has all these weird
34:24 passages that no one's ever heard of I
34:26 mean even people who are really super
34:29 educated in Christianity are like what
34:32 the hell are you talking about but he
34:34 had this thing where hid in his belief
34:37 and his research Jesus specifically said
34:42 he was coming back at a particular time
34:44 and according to this guy it was around
34:47 2,000 years but he also said that a year
34:51 wasn't the same length as it is today
34:53 and I mine okay so it sounds like what
34:55 he's about to tell me is that the year
34:58 would be longer in Jesus's time thus the
35:02 reason why it's 2019 here in Quebec is
35:04 because there's gonna be more days that
35:05 we have to account for according to the
35:07 local time that Jesus was in alright I
35:11 can't remember the number but then he
35:13 tells me that a year was shorter and
35:17 Jesus's time I like I don't know was
35:20 like 1520 days shorter so I look at him
35:24 and everyone else in the room is like
35:27 sitting on the edge of their seat some
35:30 guys can't even handle it man they're
35:31 going up and down the stairs because
35:33 they just they don't even the tension so
35:35 scary to them because I'm not backing
35:39 down
35:39 but I'm the least bit afraid of him
35:41 physically he was a big guy but [ __ ] he
35:44 would fall like a [ __ ] branch so I
35:47 look over and I'm gonna say okay
35:48 according to you what you just said he
35:52 should have been back already the dudes
35:54 face
35:56 this is absolutely hysterical man and
35:58 this is the mind of someone who can
36:00 believe this stuff in my opinion of
36:02 course he believes you see him kind of
36:06 go from looking at me to staring up at
36:10 the ceiling guard I just [ __ ] myself I
36:13 just [ __ ] myself in this conversation
36:16 and then he gets angry and then you know
36:20 it's almost Lee's posturing in his chair
36:22 and then it I think the guy on the place
36:25 was like okay guys we'll talk about that
36:27 and but he he had to have left that
36:30 night realizing that he was full of [ __ ]
36:33 just completely full of [ __ ] and this is
36:37 the mind in my opinion that could
36:39 believe this [ __ ] guy walking on water
36:43 turning water into wine because that's
36:45 super important right you could just
36:47 have water I mean water is better for
36:48 you than wine I was gonna dehydrate you
36:51 and make an alcoholic here's God going
36:53 and now if you serve wine in a church
36:56 because there's alcoholics in the room
36:59 that's a sin well Jesus was the demand
37:03 and everybody drink wine you know guess
37:05 that sin was okay back in the day again
37:09 when one of my cousin's became an
37:10 absolute ridiculous bible thumper she
37:13 went it to her father and told him he
37:14 was going to hell because he drank wine
37:16 once a night here he is a doctor she's
37:21 an absolute loser but she wanted to say
37:23 I'm a loser
37:25 and I'm going to upstage my father's
37:27 incredible accomplishment of becoming a
37:30 doctor by using this thing called
37:32 Christianity and I'm gonna take this
37:34 couple glasses that were like half
37:36 glasses of wine and say he's going to
37:40 help so sometimes sometimes the quality
37:43 of people that believe in his stuff is
37:45 also really low and sometimes it's
37:46 extremely high I don't know what the
37:49 percentage is and I wouldn't try to
37:50 estimate and like I said before in
37:53 America we raised our kids on fictitious
37:57 characters to prime them for Christ
38:00 Santa Claus Tooth Fairy Easter Bunny The
38:04 Sandman you know I mean there's just
38:05 tons of this stuff and then in the end
38:07 of course there's all the characters on
38:09 TV that you play with
38:10 your brain as a child you believe Mickey
38:14 Mouse is real until you go meet the
38:15 plastic weird dude at the park but the
38:20 one you get to keep because as you keep
38:21 getting disappointed and let down by
38:23 your elders that this stuff is all fake
38:25 you have this one teddy bear you can
38:27 squeeze against your chest which is
38:29 Jesus Christ you get to keep that one
38:31 again we have now tried to find
38:35 everything ever written down between the
38:37 Year like 50 BC up to 350 AD and I
38:45 believe the number grows it grows
38:48 without being announced to the public
38:49 but last time I checked it out it was
38:52 about a hundred and 25 actual texts
38:54 recovered from that era of people that
38:57 were assigned to record the history of
39:01 Rome and other neighboring regions and
39:05 there is no mention at all of even the
39:10 formation of the Catholic Church let
39:15 alone this God right we've seen it here
39:18 in our time for him we've got the fake
39:20 Kony 2012 crap we have fake movements
39:24 all the time and they have you know a
39:26 bunch of super impressionable whatever
39:31 can't research anything and know
39:32 anything for for real people who make
39:35 these movements happen and then you know
39:37 if somebody said 2,000 years from now
39:39 that the climate change thing was fake
39:42 and that a bunch of morons went for it
39:44 hey guess what happened we were writing
39:46 it down now we're running it down now in
39:49 this time frame you could come back and
39:50 say yes Al Gore made this movie in the
39:53 end of 2006 full of lies full of bad
39:56 predictions and then it just went from
39:59 there got crazy
40:00 there's nothing zero every single form
40:06 of evidence that you've ever been told
40:08 that Jesus really existed is fake all of
40:12 it the only thing that's happening is
40:14 people are repeating the fake [ __ ] to
40:17 each other and so what will happen is
40:19 someone's at some pool party or whatever
40:21 and
40:22 you know Pontius Pilate wrote down that
40:24 a man named Jesus from Nazareth was
40:26 crucified that's the proof then you go
40:30 and try to find that evidence and it
40:31 doesn't exist
40:34 everything doesn't exist I have been
40:37 down this path twice in my life I've had
40:39 the elders of my church tell me that
40:41 doesn't exist that it's better to
40:42 believe in Christ then is to believe in
40:44 nothing and that's where we get to our
40:47 second part of this this game but before
40:50 we jump into that here's my reason for
40:52 making this do we live in a world of
40:56 pure truth right now in 2019 or do we
40:58 live in a world of pure propaganda of
41:01 the propaganda that we know exists is it
41:03 helping Society or is it breaking up
41:05 Society we all know the answer because
41:09 we won't believe in the truth because we
41:12 are hanging on to fake teddy bears we
41:14 will believe anything that isn't true
41:17 this is why the world sucks this is why
41:21 you can't get a straight answer out of a
41:22 politician straight answer out of a
41:24 banker so if you were to say okay the
41:30 show Star Trek next generation ran from
41:33 87 to what 94 95 somewhere in there one
41:38 of the most brilliant nemesis races to
41:42 ever be invented in a fictional science
41:44 fiction movie or sci-fi movie or show
41:47 was the board and the Borg were all hive
41:50 minded and the only way you can kill the
41:53 board is to infect them with the virus
41:56 that that affects the entire board
41:59 continuum and they all die but it seems
42:03 like if you contrast gene Roddenberry
42:05 Star Trek you know Enterprise staff
42:08 against a Borg cube what's the
42:10 difference well the Borg cube is all
42:12 socialism communism crazy robotic
42:15 assimilation mindset inside the
42:19 enterprise is a bunch of individuals who
42:21 could think for themselves and won't do
42:23 anything that harms someone else the
42:25 fact they have the prime directive to
42:26 make sure they don't harm another planet
42:29 going to soon before warp is discovered
42:32 right okay
42:35 which side do you want to be on if we
42:38 were to think about society today we're
42:43 infected by fiction or infected by it it
42:48 is a mechanism by which our brains are
42:49 trained to accept crazy as truth and it
42:55 becomes this thing by indoctrinating
42:57 children into fiction all right I did to
43:01 my kid without being awake right I lied
43:04 to my child to create this fantasy world
43:07 that then let them down my kid walked
43:11 away from religion 100% for numerous
43:14 reasons but now a politician can lie
43:17 Hillary Clinton can go up and say she
43:20 cares about you and people believe it
43:22 and when she doesn't get elected people
43:24 cry and hey no matter what side we're on
43:27 we're probably all scooping up a big
43:29 tablespoon of fake propaganda and we can
43:33 if we're religious because we keep that
43:35 fake propaganda thing inside of our head
43:37 now what if you do wake up if you do
43:43 have the guts to listen to dr. out Wells
43:45 research do some research and the titus
43:47 flavius yourself go trying to find that
43:49 proof that Jesus exists outside of a
43:52 religious paradigm try to answer a
43:54 debate without saying well the Bible
43:56 says you realize if someone comes to me
43:58 and says well the Bible says this and
44:00 then and that's why the Bible is true
44:02 it's like me saying well the the grey
44:06 aliens book says this and you're like
44:09 what that grey aliens aren't real no the
44:11 great alien bukas is telling me that the
44:14 great lands are real and you're like
44:16 that doesn't make any sense you're using
44:17 the fictitious thing of believing in
44:20 great leans to make sure the grey aliens
44:21 are real the Raelians or whatever
44:25 they're called right all right well
44:28 you're using your fake book to say that
44:29 your fake book is real how convenient
44:32 now come back to Planet Earth
44:35 put your two feet on that grass back
44:37 there without any shoes on let Mother
44:40 Earth give you her energy take some acid
44:44 whatever you got to do I joined the
44:47 universe right
44:48 we still feel a divine thing going on
44:51 don't we I mean every single time I see
44:55 these internet videos where they're
44:57 filming an amazing snail or amazing fish
44:59 or amazing insect was that the the ninja
45:04 manta mantas human beings everything
45:10 there's evidence of something that
45:13 really happened here but something from
45:14 nothing
45:15 ah grow them makes no sense
45:17 mathematically is zero doesn't turn into
45:19 an infinite number instantaneously it
45:22 doesn't happen if we're here then we've
45:24 probably always been here oh sure my
45:27 body's gonna be born it's gonna die it's
45:30 gonna rot it'll become something else
45:32 and then my energy keeps going but now
45:37 what about my elders who heard I was
45:40 writing a book which dealt with heaven
45:44 and hell with God and the devil with
45:47 Jesus and I wanted to to put in the book
45:53 these pieces of proof that Jesus existed
45:57 I wanted that in my book I kept asking
46:00 for help from all my elders I mean just
46:02 help me just it's so easy right it's so
46:05 easy just show it to me no one would
46:08 answer my question and everybody kept
46:11 getting annoyed with me because I was
46:12 believing their [ __ ] isn't that
46:15 [ __ ] hilarious it got to the point
46:19 where they pulled me aside they pulled
46:20 me up to the elders little meeting room
46:22 off to the side of the the main hall and
46:26 they said I heard you are looking for
46:28 the proof of Jesus and I'm excited I'm
46:31 like oh my god I finally I guess I've
46:33 come enough times I've been nice to
46:35 people long enough that I'm now gonna
46:37 get the answer and to my utter shock and
46:42 awe with professors from Pepperdine in
46:45 religious studies sitting in there with
46:47 PhDs and the Bible right they said well
46:51 there is no proof the christ ever
46:54 existed but it's better that we believe
46:56 then not believe because law of the
46:59 jungle is the alternative
47:02 and I believe him a thousand percent and
47:05 at that point I grew up quite a bit what
47:08 takes the Bible from being sort of a
47:10 bizarre horror movie it's a horror movie
47:13 if you really think about it if I said
47:16 to Hollywood look I have this some I
47:18 have this some new movie I'm gonna write
47:21 it starts off with two virgins in this
47:24 garden and then this snake messes with
47:27 them and the chick eats the Apple and
47:30 and all hell breaks loose they're
47:32 suddenly realized they're naked they're
47:34 ashamed of themselves she has menstrual
47:36 cycles and painful childbirth like all
47:38 oh Jesus really yeah yeah yeah it's
47:40 great oh and all their brothers and
47:42 sisters are totally screwing each other
47:44 like crazy until one of the brothers
47:46 kills another brother and then one of
47:48 the fathers actually is told by this
47:51 this dude who created the place to stick
47:53 a knife in his son's neck but that
47:56 second he pulls out he then floods the
47:59 entire world and kills everybody but a
48:01 few people on an ark of course he saved
48:03 all the animals as much as he possibly
48:05 could say the dinosaurs showed up lowly
48:08 unicorns couldn't be bothered then it
48:12 kind of really builds up society and
48:13 this dude Moses comes down and with
48:14 these Ten Commandments and everybody who
48:16 didn't follow the Ten Commandments on
48:18 the first night he were drunk as hell
48:19 worshipping this golden calf right down
48:21 the street what God kills them all like
48:24 this guy he creates place kills them all
48:26 Sodom and Gomorrah all these stories
48:28 right King Solomon is he's a porn movie
48:32 right - dude how many wives did he have
48:34 at the same exact time all right
48:37 but then okay so then it gets better so
48:40 there's about a couple thousand years of
48:41 that and then the big guy sends down His
48:44 only Son he's only got one kid but he
48:46 sends him down and then the kid gets
48:49 himself killed but before he leaves he
48:51 says that everyone's supposed to eat his
48:53 flesh in his blood and in a ritual to
48:56 remember him what category at
49:00 Blockbuster / Netflix would this be in
49:04 it being a horror movie category but
49:09 this is our story how God rolls man
49:13 now the reason why I think it's like
49:16 that is because life has been a horror
49:18 movie for humanity up until recently we
49:21 have had law of the jungle for a really
49:23 long time and if you think about it even
49:25 in the days of the Caesars and the rule
49:28 of Rome my god if you didn't work for
49:31 the city you would have a legion march
49:33 into your village demanding but the
49:39 talent to Caesar you didn't give it they
49:45 would take a limb off right I mean we
49:49 have the the Crusades we have the
49:52 invasion of Genghis Khan and his folks
49:54 we have Arab battles all over Europe we
49:57 have a really tumultuous with the
50:00 plagues bubonic plague you know it's it
50:02 was a horror show and at the same time
50:05 we're battling elements of the the
50:09 idiots that have the big bodies then
50:14 we're trying to squeeze out a little bit
50:16 of sophistication in society to reboil
50:19 this thing in such a way that we can get
50:23 along so what's interesting about the
50:26 Bible now is when you read it everyone
50:28 skips over all those other horrific
50:31 stories and somehow somehow they're
50:35 getting positivity out of murders or
50:38 attempted murders or complete and
50:41 genocide all extinction moments that's
50:44 all positive it's all great what do they
50:48 tell you about Satanism it reverses
50:51 symbolism what is bad is what is good
50:54 and what is good is bad hmm again if I
51:00 turn in this the Bible never was written
51:02 and I turn this whole thing into
51:03 Hollywood people would sit in the movie
51:06 theaters and see bad for being bad but
51:09 if I were to roll it up into some Joseph
51:12 Smith religion and tell them to reverse
51:15 the polarity in their mind now I've got
51:18 bad being good and good being bad
51:21 I've got fiction being truth and all of
51:26 that has to be processed in the
51:27 human mind your mind is dynamic it will
51:32 reprogram itself just like an artificial
51:34 intelligence that can reprogram itself
51:37 to accept whatever is coming in what do
51:41 you think Stockholm Syndrome comes from
51:43 these little kids that are held up by
51:45 some John Podesta in a shower somewhere
51:47 to be sexually molested every single day
51:49 they end up falling in love with their
51:52 captor and why is that because man is
51:55 made of love man needs to love something
51:58 and if the only point of reference you
52:00 have is torture
52:01 well you better join them you better
52:04 psychologically join them otherwise
52:05 you're just gonna shut off and die and
52:07 as a matter of survival we create
52:09 acceptance for the unacceptable but then
52:12 you have the folks that believe in the
52:14 Bible and they do harvest just the good
52:16 stuff and consequently a magic happens
52:19 I mean seriously they become amazing
52:22 people they have morals they perhaps
52:25 don't swear as much as I do they're
52:28 people you can rely on in society you're
52:31 Mormons for instance you're latter-day
52:33 saints of Jesus Christ folks now I know
52:38 a lot of folks that used to be that and
52:39 they'll come out what's funny is they
52:41 will come out and say really bad things
52:45 about the church but they still remained
52:47 usually in most cases more refined the
52:52 rest of us who didn't grow up in that
52:54 institution now there's a lot of things
52:57 that are unrelated to Christ in the
52:58 Bible that are related to perhaps like
53:01 Masonic stuff were Tesla we've talked
53:05 about sacred geometry information being
53:07 hidden in the Bible so there's maybe
53:09 even some brilliance and that as well
53:11 some multi-layered stuff but when I get
53:14 approached by someone who worries about
53:16 my soul the interesting thing is is that
53:20 there are some people that are just
53:21 wonderful people who have that emotion
53:23 for me and there's other people that
53:25 come at me from a whole different
53:27 perspective of controlling me you're in
53:31 trouble
53:32 you're in trouble and I've the I'm man
53:37 and I got your solutions
53:40 if you want my solution your subjugated
53:43 to me I now have a authoritative control
53:46 over you hmm
53:48 think about that how educated do you
53:52 have to be to really learn the rules of
53:53 the Bible no I mean the beautiful thing
53:56 is it's not that complicated so you
53:57 don't have to be that that brilliant
53:59 which is great it's it's sort of like an
54:01 all-purpose you know utility knife
54:04 everyone can kill everybody with it or
54:06 you could carve some wood into something
54:08 interesting or useful right my cousin
54:11 who who's probably a much different
54:13 person today when she came at her father
54:15 for drinking some mad dog 20/20 at night
54:19 seriously ain't no dude he's only
54:25 rumored to been drunk like once in his
54:28 entire life and he really wasn't drunk I
54:30 mean it was just like extra tipsy so the
54:32 guy he's always got it under control
54:34 he's not a [ __ ] still alive did this
54:36 day in his 80s doing really well all
54:40 right so this girl is completely out of
54:43 control in her own life and she wanted
54:46 control she wanted a Thor time and sushi
54:50 usurped the Bible to go get that now a
54:53 lot of you believe in Jesus in the Bible
54:54 you look at that example in your go
54:56 Jesus that was really a bad thing that
54:57 she did I don't condone that and I'm
54:59 glad that you don't but now what do we
55:03 do if we don't have a Bible but if we do
55:05 what do I do when I don't have Jesus
55:07 Christ as my quote-unquote fictional
55:09 Savior okay I'll tell you what I used
55:15 the Bible I used the story of Christ I
55:18 use it every day but I also have a
55:22 direct communication with my creator
55:24 because I have never been out of his
55:25 purview I've never been out of his world
55:28 I'm always in the world of God and fo I
55:30 was ever not inside my creators don't
55:33 mean I would cease to exist when I did
55:36 my wrister Rogers episode you know it
55:39 occurred to me about halfway through the
55:41 episode that there has barely ever been
55:44 anyone truly christ-like on planet earth
55:46 that I could name and mr. Rogers is one
55:49 of those guys he truly was the most
55:52 Jesus like character
55:54 personally know if and I'm sure there's
55:55 millions of them that didn't get famous
55:58 right but he's one that did one can use
56:03 the parables that go back again perhaps
56:05 tens of thousands of years before Christ
56:08 ever was rumored to have existed at the
56:11 time when they are putting the Horus and
56:13 Isis
56:14 you know hieroglyph on a wall of a
56:17 virgin birth you can use it to steer
56:21 clear of issues you can use it to
56:26 enlighten yourself to really the
56:28 infinite degree how do you think
56:30 churches meet every single Sunday and a
56:32 pastor goes up there and it's
56:34 interesting I have rarely ever been to a
56:38 church or if a pastor starts talking
56:41 about some example in the Bible and some
56:43 comparison to our personal life that
56:45 wasn't fascinating the entire three
56:48 years I went to that church in Camarillo
56:50 California the preacher there was
56:52 fantastic and I just was I was always
56:57 interested I loved going and it improved
56:59 my life instilled in me some basic
57:02 algorithms of control management
57:06 happiness and it is the ultimate guide
57:09 for the common law teaches you how to do
57:12 no harm it teaches you when you've done
57:14 harm how to get out of it it's important
57:17 because like I said in like my second or
57:19 third episode of deep thoughts way back
57:22 when I said I don't know about you but I
57:26 haven't gotten a brochure on how to live
57:29 my life have you and because we don't
57:32 get the brochure we have to keep working
57:38 at it we have to keep sharing our
57:40 stories so other than the hell and
57:44 brimstone crap in the Bible and the pay
57:46 on to caesar what is caesar's passages
57:48 and a lot of examples of god being you
57:51 know a mentally impaired child there's a
57:58 lot of good stuff in there a lot of good
58:01 stuff in there think about it why do we
58:04 allow our children to believe in Santa
58:06 Claus at least in
58:07 America well any parent that approaches
58:10 December and you have an honoree little
58:12 bastard child who's actually a good kid
58:14 but you know they're just in that phase
58:16 and you tell that child you know what
58:19 here's I'll Santa Claus works he's got a
58:22 list the ones that are naughty and the
58:25 ones that are nice the ones that are
58:26 nice get gifts the ones that are naughty
58:28 get a lump of coal or nothing it doesn't
58:31 even show up to the house if you're an
58:33 only child can you believe that so you
58:37 better behave and the kids like okay
58:40 I'll behave and they slip but then you
58:42 remind them go back to feeling good but
58:44 as soon as Christmas is over it's all
58:46 back to the old ways so the interesting
58:49 thing is is that's like a little
58:51 training wheel for the Bible because the
58:53 Bible doesn't play games the Bible says
58:56 this is the way it is if you continue
59:01 sinning even if you took Jesus as your
59:02 Savior and the Holy Spirit during your
59:04 baptism and you continue to sin you need
59:08 last rites and you know according to the
59:10 Catholic Church to be just finally
59:12 cleansed of all of your sin because if
59:15 you couldn't do it yourself right and
59:18 the other thing that just is undeniable
59:20 is that what has happened since the
59:23 Catholic Church went off the rails which
59:25 was instantaneously right it was built
59:28 off the rails but again pedophilia
59:32 they never help anyone in an aid
59:35 situation they help launder money for
59:37 Nazis and means this place is just it's
59:39 like it's infinitely evil they have one
59:43 guy who runs the whole joint he's like a
59:45 god on earth because Jesus gave him the
59:47 key way back in Michelangelo's days
59:49 seriously this is the institution that
59:52 formed this religion but people love the
59:55 idea and the wisdom within this Bible
59:58 because they filter out all this
60:00 negativity that the Catholic Church had
60:03 from the very beginning and so now we
60:05 have all these other denominations of
60:07 religion of Christian excuse me and
60:11 supposedly you can take from a purely
60:13 evil Potter of sludge and you can pull
60:16 out this good part and keep it
60:20 mmm-hmm maybe maybe I would rather go to
60:25 go to my Creator and stand before him or
60:28 her and say yeah you know I fell for the
60:30 man-made thing for a little while then I
60:32 realized that you and I have never been
60:33 apart and you know I've been talking to
60:38 you every single day since I figured
60:39 this out and I mean seriously the only
60:43 thing that will happen if there is a God
60:45 for me personally a god they can
60:48 communicate whether it be the center of
60:49 the universe and it's some conscious AI
60:51 or whatever will be that I can finally
60:56 hear God talk back to me
60:58 hopefully that was the case right in
61:01 whatever form we communicate man is
61:04 trying to awake in the 21st century and
61:08 it's I think it most intellectual people
61:12 understand that if I were to say to you
61:15 Hillary Clinton is an evil person her
61:20 and her husband have arkin sighted
61:21 dozens of people there's over a dozen
61:24 people that got their heads blown off by
61:27 a shotgun in Arkansas clean off their
61:29 next dump
61:30 that's that family and I convinced you
61:33 that that one family has got a horrible
61:35 thing about them and you believe that
61:38 well does that have value sure but if I
61:42 were to say now forget about the
61:44 Clintons specifically let's study
61:49 royalty banker cartels families that are
61:53 over the royalty corruption at its very
61:58 finest fundamental level and I point you
62:01 at that and now your wisdom is like an
62:06 all-purpose algorithm that can look over
62:09 the vista of reality right and now you
62:12 can see corruption because you
62:15 understand that old adage who benefits
62:17 from this catastrophe from this crisis
62:19 and you're like they do they do they do
62:23 oh my gosh maybe they did it and you a
62:26 little research and you find out oh yeah
62:27 big giant hundred and ten story
62:29 buildings don't fall to furniture fires
62:32 and you started to see the world a
62:34 little clearer and you start to see like
62:38 a black sheep like someone who sticks
62:40 out like a sore thumb evil now you are
62:46 equipped to use the religious paradigm
62:49 to be the Paladin for truth to make this
62:53 world a better place and to be more than
62:55 just an observer but to be an actual
62:58 architect of the new way to think which
63:03 is probably very simple and mundane it's
63:06 not going to be flower aful the truth of
63:09 our world would not have real
63:13 superheroes right there won't be this
63:16 son of God ever coming down that story
63:19 will disappear now the value again of
63:22 his message that was harvested from all
63:24 the brightest moments of man which might
63:27 very well be divinely inspired the good
63:30 parts well it still sticks around we
63:36 tell parables all the time to each other
63:38 to educate each other to educate
63:39 children we tell the ESOP fable the boy
63:43 who called wolf all the time to teach
63:45 children not to lie because eventually
63:47 they'll wear out their credibility I
63:50 don't know if that kid ever existed but
63:52 even if he didn't exist that story hits
63:54 it right on the head doesn't it well
63:58 take your pick of where you gonna get
64:00 your parables hieroglyphs on Egyptian
64:03 walls or Jesus Christ it's a lot easier
64:06 to read the New Testament or the King
64:09 James doesn't he King James Bible
64:10 whatever I've touched on this several
64:13 times in different episodes man is
64:17 amazing all by himself isn't he meaning
64:21 mankind ladies and we're not allowed to
64:25 have credit for who we are off the time
64:27 if there's Machu Picchu aliens built it
64:31 if it's a pyramid aliens built it you
64:33 know if anything's happened it can't be
64:34 mankind that built it God built it
64:37 God did everything for us and we're just
64:39 these lame and down here I want you to
64:42 be a free thinker and I want you to be
64:43 able to disengage
64:46 from fiction doesn't mean you again you
64:50 get rid of the message that's good in
64:51 some cases if you're finally benefit
64:54 from this from a fictional story wrapped
64:57 in parable wrapped in parable then good
65:01 keep it but you don't have to make it
65:04 literally real and you certainly don't
65:06 have to worry about my soul at any point
65:08 in your life I mean what if this is run
65:13 this scenario down what if God's real
65:14 and Jesus isn't and then you go meet him
65:18 and you've cast all these you know blue
65:24 intent on people dark intent on people
65:28 because you thought this story of Jesus
65:30 was real like my cousin let's say she
65:32 she doesn't do this that accusation
65:34 about alcohol I don't think anymore but
65:37 I even had my one of my aunt's who was I
65:42 mean she drinks a lot but she'll just
65:44 tell you at the dinner table you're
65:45 gonna go to hell I mean it's just
65:46 [ __ ] unbelievable right but now she
65:49 goes both these women go to heaven and
65:51 they meet God or whatever heaven is you
65:54 know it's just where God is wherever
65:55 that is necessarily pearly gates or and
65:58 that kind of stuff you know they have to
66:00 stand before their creator and go yeah I
66:02 told my father my relatives and my
66:07 friends that they were going to go to
66:10 hell a place that doesn't even exist
66:13 because I believe doctrine that evil
66:18 pedophiles created that the Senators of
66:22 Rome cannibalized from 26 previous
66:25 renditions and I was given the truth but
66:30 I didn't want to believe it so I didn't
66:32 believe it and so I carried it all the
66:33 way to my deathbed damning everyone
66:36 along the way feeling superior to my
66:40 fellow men there's this great passage in
66:43 the Bible of this great section in the
66:44 Bible where the guy goes to a temple
66:46 he's a rich dude and is like a church
66:50 and everyone's in there worshiping and
66:52 it's every one of different class
66:54 structures most of them poor and this
66:57 guy stands up at the end of the
67:00 Pew's and he says he starts praying to
67:03 God out loud he says God I want you to I
67:05 want to thank you for making me not like
67:08 these people putting himself on a
67:11 pedestal and it's supposed to be a
67:14 parable to teach you not to do that and
67:19 I've got plenty wonderful friends that
67:21 would never ever do that to another
67:22 human being that's the majority of them
67:24 but I've got plenty of my family you do
67:28 and I just angst over that a little bit
67:30 for them I'm just like well it's really
67:32 a sad thing that when you go meet your
67:35 Creator if there is one some central
67:38 consciousness you probably forget what
67:40 you did and but isn't even matter but if
67:41 you did hang on to least your record for
67:44 a few minutes it's gonna be so
67:46 embarrassing so embarrassing if there
67:50 was a reason to be put back down on
67:52 earth to do this again and reincarnation
67:53 would be to get through this life with
67:58 your head out of your ass okay so my
68:01 goal has always been to talk about this
68:03 in a way that wouldn't offend anybody I
68:04 just think it's impossible and I think
68:07 for those of you that do believe and
68:09 continue to believe even after this
68:10 episode and you don't have a feeling of
68:13 animosity towards me
68:15 you are amazing human being I appreciate
68:18 your patience but this is something I've
68:21 definitely spent a good three decades
68:25 thinking about researching and comparing
68:28 notes with other folks and so again I
68:34 just think that this is all in stages
68:37 too right so maybe you know if you were
68:39 to be in a scientific think tank let's
68:41 say I created a think tank of 30 people
68:46 super intellectuals and no one in that
68:49 room believes that this story is literal
68:52 but it has value they might still say
68:56 okay well we're gonna have to approach
68:58 this in steps right at the very last
69:01 step would probably be this step which
69:04 is to get folks to relax a little bit on
69:07 the literal translations of all things
69:09 relaxed on this being actually real
69:11 relaxed on selling people there actually
69:13 isn't a hell your own your hell is your
69:16 own creation men treat people poorly and
69:21 see where that gets you you know defy
69:24 goodness and in common law and see where
69:27 that gets you it creates a hell work
69:30 you're in a world where everybody
69:32 despises you or at least those that you
69:35 wish loved you don't there's always time
69:39 to change I mean there's always time to
69:41 change and quite frankly the Bible's got
69:43 great methodologies for you to undo a
69:45 lot of your bad stuff but if you're
69:47 using that mechanism to accuse others of
69:50 being sinners and you've got the
69:53 superior way and all the pedophiles are
69:55 right and all the people that don't
69:56 touch kids are going to hell I mean and
69:58 then a funny thing right that church in
70:00 Cameroon the non-denominational Church
70:04 of Christ in camarillo blew apart
70:07 because the youth minister was arrested
70:09 at Pepperdine University got two years
70:14 in jail he was accused by at least five
70:17 girls of doing things he coerced them
70:20 into having sex with them was the way it
70:21 was written in the in the charges denied
70:25 it to the last second but again any one
70:29 of his daughters knows that they would
70:31 never make up such a story because it
70:33 means they're damaged goods for the rest
70:35 of life as per the culture of America
70:38 right isn't really true at all but
70:40 that's how you feel about it so for
70:41 little girls to come out and say that
70:44 for me is one hundred percent five kids
70:47 man five kids and the guy only did two
70:49 years
70:51 leave it to California to just swat a
70:55 hand of a guy like that I suppose you
70:59 had to stay in the special side of the
71:00 prison so you know there's infinite
71:05 stories that stuff I just covered some
71:06 of it I'm will cover it again but give
71:09 it some food for thought this is
71:12 advanced thinking in some cases anyway
