00:00 [Music]
00:35 welcome back boys and girls the deep
00:39 dots
00:40 well should we do today I have no clue
00:46 it's amazing that in just 300 episodes
00:51 if you count the special reports and all
00:54 that good stuff one can get to the end
00:57 of like your topic grope you know like
01:00 [ __ ] man I've talked about aliens as
01:02 much as I can even conceive of talking
01:03 about aliens babalu it's kind of a
01:12 breezy day today here weather update
01:15 goes as follows sixty-eight sparsely
01:19 cloudy no Kim trails today no controls
01:23 yesterday day before that it was like we
01:26 were inside the womb of you know some
01:30 barium stomach some aluminum oxide
01:33 stomach
01:34 I've often toyed with just doing
01:36 episodes where we just sit and shoot the
01:39 breezes they might say but we always
01:43 find a topic don't we as you know I love
01:46 talking about stuff that we all feel but
01:49 we never talk about you know it's that
01:51 it's that subject matter where you find
01:53 yourself at the end of a one-way street
01:56 and you're like how the hell did I get
01:59 here and didn't you know I passed a
02:02 bunch of people as I was going down this
02:04 street and nobody said hey mister where
02:07 you going that's a dead end right there
02:09 I suppose they assumed that I could
02:12 sprout wings in
02:13 flyout right no no there's the thought
02:18 was going to that massage parlor Dean I
02:20 don't know yeah we got politics we could
02:23 talk about you got the Cuban on
02:25 phenomenon it's pretty interesting the
02:29 politics is so polarized isn't it you
02:33 know I'm either this and you're either
02:34 that and then we could just I don't know
02:38 go after each other I will say that I'm
02:41 very impressed with you folks because I
02:45 will express an opinion here and there
02:47 and then I will find you guys down the
02:49 line having enjoyed the show and giving
02:55 it alkyl aids of your own and then I'll
02:57 find out we completely believe the
02:58 different complete opposite stuff and
03:00 that's cool it's like alright so they
03:03 didn't you know have a fit because we're
03:06 different I know a lot of you are very
03:10 devout Christians and you do believe
03:12 that well let's just put this way
03:14 you do believe what Christianity teaches
03:16 to whatever degree and you know that I
03:20 have my beliefs on that areas where I
03:24 believe it's of great value and others
03:27 that I think are more allegorical and
03:31 you know may be valuable maybe not I
03:36 don't know but you stick around and
03:40 that's super cool and again it says more
03:41 about you than it probably does for me
03:43 because I get to sit here and say
03:45 whatever I want and you are actually
03:48 listening you're you're sacrificing your
03:51 time and so you need to understand that
03:55 it's extremely respected and you know
04:00 I'm your fan as much as you might be
04:02 mine you know what the self-help stuff
04:06 or the or the what I like to call
04:07 self-improvement episodes you know again
04:11 it's it's interesting when I grew up in
04:16 the Midwest there wasn't a tremendous
04:19 amount of talk about
04:23 you know going to Hollywood and becoming
04:25 something it just never happened I
04:26 always see that because that's a cliche
04:28 for anything in the entertainment
04:31 business right it really means music
04:32 television behind the camera in front of
04:35 the camera whatever right so there's a
04:39 certain number of years I had to think
04:40 like the Midwest which was that you'll
04:42 never have a chance to be these things
04:44 and then there was just some point where
04:47 I don't know I just had this I'm going
04:52 to do this and you can't stop me you
04:55 know [ __ ] you all won't do what you tell
04:57 me and I think when I was a kid I really
04:59 sensed the the fear in adults
05:03 I sensed their mortality and maybe their
05:09 fragility I don't know the fact that
05:11 they weren't perfect the fact they
05:13 really didn't know what the hell they
05:14 were doing when I heard absolutely
05:15 ignorant statements out of my parents
05:17 from time to time I was like do you just
05:19 say that it doesn't make any goddamn
05:21 sense you're gonna tell me the rest of
05:24 the story I don't think so
05:26 it was very valuable people used to come
05:30 up to me you know when I was younger
05:31 especially when I was younger my parents
05:33 divorced when I was nine and you know
05:36 just for the record they remained
05:37 friends okay they're very good friends
05:40 in fact very very good friends after the
05:43 divorce so it wasn't like when these you
05:45 know angry you know custody wars yeah
05:48 kind of stuff they just really handled
05:50 like amazing adults and it's really
05:54 funny because I've rarely seen a divorce
05:55 ago as beautifully clean as my parents
05:59 it's interesting but people used to come
06:03 up to me and oh my god that must have
06:05 been hard her how her you know like you
06:09 know I barely noticed they weren't
06:11 really spending a hell of a lot of time
06:12 with me anyway as a kid which in the end
06:15 I'm telling you that might sound like a
06:17 defense mechanism why just I don't care
06:19 you don't know yeah I would like my dad
06:22 to have been there in Boy Scouts which
06:24 is actually I was in Cub Scouts I was
06:25 too young to get in Boy Scouts
06:28 you know I tell that story one of my
06:29 episodes about watching the other year
06:30 the other kids father's help them create
06:34 the wooden car that rolls down the ramp
06:36 and my dad wasn't there and so I had to
06:38 do it by myself and I got the tire
06:40 [ __ ] up and so it's rolling down this
06:42 where you happen to get stuck and I'm
06:43 just like this is yeah I said you know
06:46 like this is some [ __ ] right here you
06:50 know it's just like and I remember
06:51 looking the car gets stuck and my other
06:54 friends cars are just [ __ ] amazing
06:55 their dads have done these incredible
06:57 jobs obviously the fathers have done all
06:59 the work and I remember I did it the way
07:02 it set it on the box was just probably
07:04 some diagram of how to do it in 1955 and
07:08 my car goes day and it's on this
07:09 steepest decline of this ramp and it's
07:13 still stuck I mean that's how much the
07:15 front right tire got off you want to put
07:18 the nail through it and I looked at my
07:21 mom I remember just looking at my car
07:23 and looking at my mom ain't going what
07:27 the [ __ ] am I doing here right this is
07:29 about a father-son Club and I'm sitting
07:33 here with you you're not my dad you're
07:36 my mom right if we want to go [ __ ]
07:38 make pottery let's let's let's have a
07:41 father or sorry a mother-son situation
07:44 right consequently I did he used to
07:48 follow my mom through those pottery
07:50 places back in the 70s when you would go
07:53 and find one that's already been fired
07:54 and you had to etch down a little trim
07:57 and the 50% mark when you sand it off
08:00 and then you'd paint it and I remember
08:03 asking if I could do it and they said I
08:05 must have been about six or seven I
08:07 remember my mom going well maybe when
08:10 you're older and I'm like I'm painting
08:14 photographs on in oil paint at home and
08:17 you're worried if I can paint a god to
08:19 him
08:20 pottery thing I mean it's weird how this
08:24 happens but anyway the divorce was cool
08:25 because it taught me that you're only
08:32 older when you get older that's all
08:35 that's taking place it's up to you as to
08:39 whether not you're never going to get
08:40 wize right maybe we make that the
08:43 episode wisdom it's actually funny I
08:49 remember thinking about creating that
08:51 webisode there's an interesting thing
08:54 about wisdom because I think it's a
08:59 multi-dimensional definition right you
09:03 can have a lot of wisdom in some weird
09:04 people but more often than not you get
09:08 wisdom from very relaxed cool centered
09:12 people because to get it from any other
09:16 source would be probably compromise
09:20 wisdom I'll give an example we know that
09:25 the world is you know it's been run by
09:28 some secret societies and that kind of
09:30 stuff I don't want to get off into that
09:31 realm in this episode but imagine
09:33 walking into a room and you have the
09:36 richest / wisest men of this particular
09:40 area of the world but they're all into
09:43 the biases right they're all into the we
09:46 don't serve their kind sort of thing and
09:49 there's tradition and you got to lick my
09:52 heel for the first 20 years you're here
09:54 and then maybe if you're lucky
09:56 you keep getting you know apron bands
09:59 and karate belts to the point you get up
10:01 to my level and done it up which is
10:02 obviously a big [ __ ] child stuck
10:06 inside some goddamn Masonic ritual and
10:09 the only way they ever get any [ __ ]
10:10 power in this world is to engage in this
10:13 [ __ ] right it's fake Authority it's
10:16 fake wisdom it's fake ascension and
10:20 enlightenment obviously we can't have a
10:24 twelve-year-old walk in and run the
10:26 United States of America I'm not talking
10:27 about that but an eager soul that wants
10:31 to learn that has a quaff of maturity
10:36 about them at least you can see they're
10:38 on the right track they're taking steps
10:40 towards becoming a mature adult that's
10:43 the first inkling that you have someone
10:46 who is in a basically a qualified
10:48 apprentice because it takes a long time
10:52 to teach someone something
10:53 no matter what it is right and it's best
10:57 if you have come almost full circle with
10:59 your emotional spectrum now what does
11:02 that mean well what is uh well I put
11:05 this way when you write screenplays
11:06 there are these it's like a color table
11:11 and what's a color table do when you're
11:13 an artist it lets you know what colors
11:14 go together really well meaning which
11:17 colors are but when place beside
11:19 themselves beside each other excuse me
11:22 will be very complementary to the eye
11:25 I'll give an example like a navy blue
11:28 next to a nice milky gold on the color
11:32 wheel you got your Blues over here and
11:34 if you go straight across and a
11:36 perpendicular line from the sphere or
11:38 the circle excuse me you're gonna find
11:39 gold over there and no matter how you
11:42 draw a line through this chart the
11:45 geniuses of the world who figured all
11:46 this out have got you covered you can
11:51 start it red and you're like I got a
11:52 logo it's got to be red well what's a
11:54 complement color to red you just look at
11:55 the color table and draw straight across
11:57 and boom you find out what's there but
12:00 my writing teacher Robert McKee he has
12:03 an emotional version of that love hate
12:08 right but then there's all the
12:10 subtleties and what he ends up doing is
12:12 creating another circle on the outside
12:13 which is more of your your in your color
12:17 wheel you have Prime colors which are
12:20 the ones that are the the first crayon
12:21 box you get which just has like 12
12:23 colors in it right it's when they're
12:26 really big and they have a flat side so
12:28 I won't roll off the desk and then when
12:31 you go out you start getting the hundred
12:33 crayon set which is got all those wild
12:36 ass colors in it and the key does the
12:38 same thing right so when I say that you
12:41 have completed sort of a rotation of
12:44 your emotional spectrum you have gone
12:46 the inner wheel and the outer wheel so
12:49 many times that you're now sort of a
12:52 master of it you know a grand master
12:54 would be able to control their emotions
12:56 at all times and genuinely control it
12:59 down to their the boughs of their soul
13:01 they control the motivation for any
13:03 emotion so it's not repressing
13:06 anger they simply manage the fact that
13:09 they don't have any if they cry it's
13:11 because they totally deeply want to cry
13:13 from the bottom of their planet right
13:15 now with us at master level maybe you
13:23 get thrown some curveballs from time to
13:25 time like Jesus I said a guy this
13:27 afternoon I'm in this alleyway leaving
13:31 for lunch and it's just the best way to
13:34 get out of this place and I'm turning
13:36 right and the green light about 300
13:38 yards away has has gone and so there's a
13:41 whole slew of cars coming in front of me
13:43 it's only one lane and this guy wants to
13:45 get into the alleyway I got one car
13:47 behind him here comes this blue truck so
13:49 I just signal nice just you know I said
13:51 you know just one second I'm pointing at
13:53 that truck I says soon as he's passed
13:54 I'll be out here and the guy honks any
13:57 guy flips me off and I'm looking at him
14:00 like why are you flipping me off you
14:03 know it's like I didn't maybe thought I
14:05 flipped him off right here it's just the
14:08 gesture would have been like one second
14:10 where you know it didn't make any sense
14:12 for whatever reason he thought I should
14:16 be able to merge with this gigantic
14:18 trough of traffic it's interesting right
14:22 not looking in his rearview mirror but
14:25 when that happened I am sort of having
14:28 this funny moment because I'm thinking
14:32 he doesn't get it or whatever reason
14:35 it's just kind of funny because there's
14:36 no need to be upset I'm out of there
14:39 blah blah blah right when you get true
14:42 wisdom from a good source it's usually
14:46 someone who's more relaxed when they're
14:48 giving it to you
14:52 obviously there is wisdom in all things
14:55 right so you could have a guy who's a
14:57 chain-smoker
14:58 you know he's really hyper whatever and
15:01 you're a machinist and the dude just
15:04 knows everything there is about
15:07 machining metal or what have you and so
15:10 you go and he's late or whatever but man
15:14 in ten minutes he could teach you ten
15:16 years worth of tricks so there's that
15:20 person - I recently attended him in a
15:23 meeting last night that was sort of
15:29 euphoric and this is good this is
15:36 actually really on track with wisdom see
15:38 how that [ __ ] happens
15:39 I am delving back into electronics like
15:43 I have never done in my life
15:45 I am going for the complete picture of
15:49 all things electronic and I'm moving at
15:53 extremely rapid pace and it is just
15:56 doing this show and getting into II
15:59 throw models of electronics when I now
16:03 stare at things that I've been using my
16:05 entire life from resistors to capacitors
16:08 to diodes to coils
16:10 I see boards it is making it is making
16:16 more sense now than it ever has and it's
16:18 almost like on a universe level which is
16:20 great but I still need assistance and
16:24 learning all the pieces and parts that
16:26 have been developed since I was last in
16:29 it right last time I was in is about
16:31 2014 when I programmed this led hat this
16:36 microcontroller which was a blast
16:42 but I have much more a much more
16:46 aggressive gosh I hate that bunch of
16:49 qualifiers in a row a very aggressive
16:52 project for myself that will again give
16:55 me a full spectrum of knowledge of this
16:56 thing so anyway I I thought to myself
16:59 isn't there a group here locally that
17:04 gets together that I could join where I
17:07 could sit with these brilliant people
17:10 and just close the gap on having to look
17:14 up a bunch of crap in Google and so
17:17 about three weeks ago I planned I went
17:19 to meetup calm and I found this group
17:21 not only is it a group that meets
17:25 locally but in a meeting for four years
17:26 straight but there's this makers
17:29 movement all around the world and they
17:35 are all about getting your hands dirty
17:37 and making something happen I guess
17:41 there's a magazine called make yes I'm
17:44 very late to this have you been in this
17:46 for a long time but for those of you
17:48 guys and girls that want to build
17:49 something you can add a fruit is run by
17:51 a genius woman so there's no sexual
17:55 barrier or gender barrier to getting
17:57 into electronics and building something
17:59 right but I have designed this thing
18:03 I'll keep it a secret for now and there
18:07 was just a couple touch points of
18:08 mechanical implementation that I needed
18:12 to figure out and so I went to the
18:15 meeting and I find out that this is a
18:18 makers sort of organization meaning they
18:21 set up offices all around the world and
18:23 you have to independently do it you know
18:25 it's not connected this is one of the
18:27 the most advanced ones in the United
18:30 States of America and it's just two or
18:32 three miles down from my house maybe
18:34 five tops they have fabrication for wood
18:39 and metal and just all kinds of crap in
18:42 this place it's beautiful beautiful
18:43 conference room we were in probably
18:46 about 20 people in there couple
18:49 presentations couple guys presenting
18:51 their projects and talking about how
18:54 they have solved
18:55 problems which was great and then it's
18:57 just sort of freestyle after about an
18:59 hour and gentleman behind me he just
19:05 looked totally interesting man he was
19:06 just like he could just tell it
19:07 everybody was talking to him because he
19:09 knew things and he had a book right
19:12 there in front of him which I owned on
19:14 an electronic form and I said you know
19:20 is that a good book
19:20 he said yeah and so he goes I said well
19:24 you know what's in that book what
19:25 appeals to you and he starts showing me
19:26 a couple of chapters out of it then we
19:29 sit down and we get into it and he's way
19:30 ahead of me right I mean this guy's I
19:32 don't know what he is but genius would
19:34 probably be a word you might use to
19:36 describe him he's kind of frustrated
19:39 because I said well this is the project
19:41 I've assigned in myself and I'm here to
19:43 really learn a couple things and so he
19:48 he shows me one of the chapters in the
19:50 book and he goes do you know what that
19:51 is and I said I don't know what that is
19:52 and he then he goes into the description
19:55 of it and he starts hitting me with some
19:56 industry phrases that I'm not familiar
19:58 with and he's got looking at me like
20:00 well you've assigned this project to
20:02 yourself you better get you know up to
20:03 snuff on this stuff quickly and so he's
20:07 he's kind of four he's four split second
20:09 he's kind of frustrated I could tell it
20:11 was like like what are you getting in
20:13 these conversations for if you don't
20:15 know the basic vocabulary but then he
20:20 changed his gears and he starts
20:22 describing it to me and I get it and I
20:24 reiterate so he understands that I get
20:26 it now he's like okay so I'm not wasting
20:28 my time here talking to you about this
20:30 kind of stuff I presented a hardware
20:32 problem to him and we had my computer
20:36 out and he's like well look up this and
20:40 we looked this thing up and it wasn't
20:41 quite exactly what I was looking for
20:42 knee is oh no no look at this and he I
20:45 looked this new thing up and it was
20:46 exactly what I needed
20:48 and I mean better than I ever imagined
20:50 even he was surprised how advanced these
20:53 parts have become with the whole room is
20:56 full of brilliant electronics experts
21:01 and novices totally novices and I'm
21:05 sitting there going
21:07 this is exactly where I need to be to
21:09 get my goals and so instead of me
21:12 sitting in my home we're doing the Willy
21:14 Wonka routine hoping that I can type the
21:17 right keywords together in Google to get
21:19 what I want I sought out wisdom and
21:22 instantaneously found it I found the
21:25 facility that if I ever needed anything
21:28 fabricated if I needed a metal plate to
21:32 be fabricated they could do it to spec I
21:36 cost a ton of money for the prototype
21:39 but who cares right the President of the
21:41 United States in 2018 has said something
21:43 very interesting I mentioned in another
21:45 episode which I want to say right now
21:47 because we haven't heard this statement
21:50 in a really long time and even if we
21:52 have heard it and I just missed it we
21:54 haven't had any president take action to
21:56 make sure that this statement becomes a
21:58 truth or realization for the citizens of
22:03 this country in probably over 30 years
22:05 which is the following there are a few
22:08 things in life more satisfying than a
22:10 job well done that you engaged in
22:14 something and it was something that you
22:20 you accomplished
22:22 you designed whatever and you finished
22:25 it by the way I have a little spider on
22:28 the he's up there in the tripod of the
22:30 camera he's like one of those really
22:32 furry house spiders and hopefully he's
22:35 not climbing on the lens but if you see
22:37 a big spider go by I'm aware of that
22:40 he's up there I just think it's a female
22:43 it's got the emerald stone on the back
22:45 it's all black he's got the emerald
22:46 furry emblem on the back so I'm just
22:49 letting her chill okay they're the most
22:52 gentle little spiders they she watched
22:55 yesterday's episode today she's a little
22:57 tired so the subject matter is coming up
23:01 that the government may actually fund
23:03 vocational schools that being skills
23:06 schools that are related to skills like
23:09 working with your hands essentially
23:11 right fixing a car building a house
23:14 sewing something together and doing it
23:17 in a way that is not slave labor it
23:19 doesn't have to
23:19 it doesn't require an immigrant from
23:22 another country to take money underneath
23:24 the table but that we can actually pay
23:27 American citizens living wages to get
23:31 this stuff accomplished now you may not
23:32 be able to live in you know Laguna Beach
23:35 putting together this stuff but you know
23:37 every town has a mechanic you know every
23:41 town does so understand that your
23:45 salaries aren't the same for the same
23:47 exact job you might make $35 an hour in
23:50 the Midwest and say Tennessee the state
23:52 of Tennessee here in America and then
23:54 you move to Laguna Beach and you're
23:56 making $90 an hour for the same job or
23:58 even more right guys who customized cars
24:02 are making 160 dollars an hour plus but
24:07 then again they know everything about
24:08 cars that could ever be known right
24:11 there have been eras in history where we
24:15 have the sort of Renaissance eras right
24:18 where we go into different phases of
24:21 hivemind
24:23 sharing in the past it was always
24:28 regional right Europeans going through a
24:31 Renaissance era the Middle East is going
24:32 through a Renaissance era the South
24:35 America obviously when the Incas
24:37 discovered whoever the hell built all
24:39 the stuff down there they were going
24:41 through their own version of it right it
24:43 just wasn't on TV right today we have a
24:47 Renaissance going on that is
24:51 unbelievable the Great Awakening of
24:53 mankind and what's really funny as these
24:57 corporations that are participating in
24:59 censoring our materials
25:01 I think the hubris is is that they
25:05 actually believed they could do it
25:07 the snowball has already started I mean
25:10 it is way bigger than could ever be
25:14 stopped at this point and every day that
25:17 goes by just gets bigger and bigger and
25:19 bigger and just to take a little
25:22 digression on that for a second
25:25 for those of you that have been censored
25:28 this bird is making the weirdest noise
25:30 must be mating season
25:33 but for those of you have been censored
25:36 I my condolences okay
25:41 because it's obviously devastating I
25:44 have this channel completely backed up
25:46 on a hard drive which is nice but some
25:49 people didn't have that opportunity
25:50 before their channels were turned off in
25:51 the middle of the night right they had
25:53 no strikes when they went to bed they
25:54 wake up and they've been issued this
25:56 notice that their videos have been
25:58 analyzed and there's more than three
26:00 strikes it's pretty easy to do if you
26:03 just want to subjectively say we have a
26:05 moving target which is called the law
26:07 and we're just gonna decide what you did
26:11 was bad strike strike strike kick but
26:15 the interesting thing is is what is
26:16 censorship done in history at least in
26:21 the last 100 years
26:23 perhaps in a fully tyrannical world
26:26 where if you watch censored material
26:28 they can hit your house with a drone and
26:30 kill you be different which is why we
26:33 can't allow that to happen therefore now
26:37 you know Catcher in the Rye which for me
26:41 I think is a please forgive me I think
26:44 it's a complete piece of [ __ ] but back
26:46 in the day when it was released it was
26:48 considered to this just monumental
26:51 intellectual accomplishment for whatever
26:54 reason I cannot get into I've tried to
26:56 read it a couple times and actually
26:58 hoped that at some point and maybe the
27:01 next 20 years I'll sit down with it and
27:02 all of a sudden there's this epiphany as
27:04 to why that's such an amazing book but I
27:07 think what the book's major purpose was
27:08 was to make you think out of the box I
27:10 also think it was fairly
27:12 anti-establishment at a time when they
27:14 wanted to start tearing this country
27:16 apart which is why it was censored it
27:20 might have been censored by well
27:22 intended people trying to hang on to the
27:25 mall fabric of this country but what
27:27 happens when you censor you draw more
27:29 attention to something or someone and
27:31 people jump in you know how many times
27:35 was did we have a movie like The
27:38 Exorcist get banned in like three or
27:40 four southern states because they're
27:42 very religious and now you're crossing
27:45 the state border to
27:47 when I was a kid fireworks certain
27:50 fireworks were deemed illegal even in
27:54 the Midwest bottle rockets were deemed
27:56 illegal because the rumor was that they
27:58 started fires and again I would buy
28:02 these things buy the cases in the
28:03 neighboring states and we'd fire him all
28:07 over the place I don't think I ever
28:08 started to fire shot him right in the
28:10 roof of the house across the street
28:12 never caught the roof on fire what
28:15 happens when you kill someone like
28:17 Martin Luther King does he go away
28:21 no he becomes a martyr and the funny
28:27 thing is look funny interesting is that
28:30 Christ was murdered and became the
28:32 savior of all the Christians I mean
28:37 isn't that the greatest form of
28:38 censorship to be murdered it makes the
28:42 story go round when something like that
28:45 happens the beautiful thing about
28:48 finding someone with wisdom is you
28:49 typically can find a true bona fide
28:55 source of shortcuts there's actually
29:00 heavy debate in the world about I don't
29:03 mean the active press but over the
29:06 centuries there's been a huge debate as
29:08 to whether or not shortcuts really exist
29:11 we know they do but how many times have
29:15 you seen someone promise you a shortcut
29:19 and there's it's it's the longest
29:22 possible way you could have engaged in
29:24 the activity that you're engaging in I
29:27 mean the number of times I've just found
29:29 myself in hell due to trying to do a
29:31 shortcut is crazy so there is a saying I
29:38 believe I've said a couple times that
29:40 I'll repeat it here because it's it's
29:42 literally your anthem of wisdom and it
29:46 goes like this it's better to take a
29:49 shorter amount of time to do the job
29:51 right than a longer amount of time to do
29:53 the job wrong when you first hear that
29:57 you're like what are you talking about
30:00 that is the stupidest thing I've ever
30:01 heard of course but what they're saying
30:07 is do the job right which is not a
30:12 shortcut but will typically take you a
30:16 shorter amount of time to accomplish
30:17 then the person promising you a shortcut
30:20 and you end up taking a hell of a lot
30:22 longer to get the job done because I was
30:27 doing something silly it was in the
30:29 early 90s I had this boss this pervy guy
30:31 from the CDC he came to us from that
30:34 organization I'll tell you what with
30:36 what we know now from queueing on WoW
30:38 the [ __ ] irony and congruent
30:42 informations crazy but he had noticed I
30:45 was doing something stupid I thought I
30:47 was doing a shortcut and I was doing
30:48 taking a lot longer to get it done so he
30:50 said that statement I looked at him like
30:51 what but he was right
30:53 god damn him his pervy nature you got
30:57 fired from our company for doing some
30:59 pretty lewd [ __ ] in front of other
31:01 people he's a grown man I'll tell you a
31:04 funny story this is just a funny story
31:07 there's nothing I mean has to do with
31:08 this this shortcut thing it's actually
31:10 the physical version of a shortcut I
31:14 don't know if I've ever I think maybe I
31:16 said this in season one but no one's
31:18 going back so let's just do it again
31:19 here I used to work in Vegas from the
31:23 Bay Area so I lived in San Francisco and
31:24 I would fly to the Bay Area
31:26 I'm sorry fly to San Francisco to work
31:27 for Westwood Studios one of our
31:29 subsidiaries of Electronic Arts they
31:31 main command & Conquer I was working on
31:34 a project called Earth and beyond so
31:37 four of us would fly in and do our
31:40 meetings and figure out what's going on
31:41 I'm doing all kinds of stuff from
31:43 conceptual art to backstory to taking
31:46 care of their website etc etc and we got
31:51 in there one night and it was just we
31:54 got in there on 6 o'clock or we need to
31:55 go eat dinner Paris had just been built
31:59 the big Eiffel Tower
32:02 it must be 2001 or early 2002 and we
32:09 land and so now we're taking the car
32:11 we're driving and they all decide that
32:13 we want to go to Paris and I'm like yeah
32:14 sure it sounds good
32:15 I've been in to any of these mega themed
32:19 casinos just yet it's been a while so my
32:23 friend he says I know a shortcut just
32:28 park the car here we're gonna go in the
32:29 back of the building and we'll work our
32:32 way to the front I know a shortcut
32:33 now what's weird is this place was just
32:35 built so I don't know how you have a
32:39 shortcut to a place that almost no one
32:41 has been inside of and obviously he was
32:43 wrong for any of you've ever seen spinal
32:46 tap the movie where they get stuck
32:48 backstage trying to find the stage is
32:51 one of the most hilarious scenes in the
32:53 film it's really pretty early in the
32:54 film there and their spandex they got
32:56 their you know flying the guitar and
32:59 their bass guitar or whatever and
33:01 they're just just bumping into each
33:02 other they can't figure out where
33:03 they're going
33:03 well that was us for I don't know how
33:06 many minutes as we are trying to make it
33:08 to the casino part of the thing
33:11 eventually we're walking down this
33:13 hallway and there's a door just random
33:16 Dornan in this flat hallway right big
33:19 long corridor right my buddy goes here
33:24 let's let's try this door because we
33:26 have just meandered all around the
33:28 bowels of this building we open this
33:30 door we all go through and it was like
33:34 probably what it felt like to be the
33:36 Time Bandits in the movie in Terry
33:39 Gilliam's movie the Time Bandits right
33:40 we walked through this door for dudes
33:45 and we're on the stage of a ball and
33:52 though we turned back and I we closed
33:54 the door and I'm looking and the whole
33:56 wall is painted to look like sky behind
33:59 it so is we've walked through a piece of
34:00 art now we're on stage in this ballroom
34:06 there are people walking around with one
34:08 there's a bunch of smoke cigarette smoke
34:10 just floating about 50% in the air I'm
34:13 looking around there is a tuxie
34:15 women are in these you know ten thousand
34:18 plus dollar dresses and I remember we're
34:23 just wandering through this ball we can
34:26 see the casino finally it's on the other
34:28 side of the this room because that's the
34:30 entrance to the ballroom we're not
34:33 supposed to be here this is insane and I
34:36 remember this woman looked at me really
34:39 tall amazing woman it's just big sequins
34:41 dress on all of the stuff gorgeous and I
34:46 can't remember what she said to me but
34:48 it was something to the effect of where
34:50 did you guys come from and I remember
34:54 looking at her and I said I said how can
34:56 you wear that dress and all this smoke I
34:58 think that's what I said cuz I was just
35:00 like coughing I was just like god damn
35:02 this is thick in here you know because
35:04 in Vegas you can smoke great and then we
35:07 just made it to the lunch everybody to
35:09 the dinner now one little other side
35:14 note to this story is the kid they told
35:16 us that he had the short cut he's
35:18 obviously into this notion that he has
35:20 the wisdom he's gonna drop on us all the
35:22 time right this is a hilarious story man
35:25 I told this once before I know I have
35:28 it's been two years so I'm gonna tell
35:30 again right here inside this wisdom
35:31 episode we sit down for dinner and this
35:40 place is perfect right it's Paris on the
35:42 first couple months that it's been open
35:44 I swear to God and he wants to order
35:47 escargot because he's had it before now
35:51 I know what that is but I've never eaten
35:53 it before I don't know how it served
35:55 he's the only one buying it and I don't
35:58 forgot what I eat and we're all sitting
36:00 there and this kid keeps talking about
36:05 escargot and telling us how it's made
36:07 and basically trying to convince us all
36:10 that he's a super expert eating escargot
36:12 and we're like okay but it's starting
36:14 get to that point that awkward point
36:15 where we're all looking at each other
36:17 going is he continuing this conversation
36:20 cuz we're kind of done with his cliff
36:23 Clavin breakdown of escargot right
36:27 so we help get our food and here comes
36:31 his escargot which I if you've never
36:33 seen it served it comes in this these
36:36 little it's a little tray that has
36:38 little tiny like ice cream scoop divots
36:42 in it right so a little Halfmoon divots
36:44 and the US cargos are floating inside
36:46 those little divots and it's floating in
36:49 boiling hot oil and they give you a
36:55 little utensil to get it out of there
36:58 here's the expert
37:01 he has convinced us or at least he's
37:04 attempted to convince us that he is the
37:06 de facto expert on such things he takes
37:10 this little scooper which fits just
37:12 inside little Halfmoon shape and I've
37:15 already started eating I'm starving to
37:16 death
37:16 it took us forever to get to this
37:18 [ __ ] restaurant we had to wait to get
37:19 her food and he has scooped up the
37:23 escargot and the oil and he puts it in
37:27 his mouth not realizing that this oil I
37:31 don't know it must be 250 plus degrees
37:37 Fahrenheit and he has one of those
37:41 moments where he has burned the inside
37:43 of his mouth so instantaneously that he
37:47 has to his body is making him spit this
37:49 out because he is on fire and I'm not
37:54 looking coz I'm got my head down to my
37:56 dish but then I look over and the expert
38:00 doesn't know how to eat escargot right
38:04 I'm assuming he probably start taking
38:07 this a little fork thing hit the
38:08 escargot dabbled off the boiling hot
38:12 stuff blown on it and eaten it or wait a
38:16 shitload of minutes before he goes and
38:18 scoops up this boiling hot oil into his
38:21 mouth at that point you know we're all
38:26 looking around and turning out the
38:29 laughs and you know only time I've ever
38:32 seen that after that point it looked
38:34 exactly the same as that I was in the
38:35 sushi restaurant and
38:37 the Bay Area had a guy who ordered hot
38:41 tea and he's on a date and he poured
38:43 himself some super hot tea which is why
38:45 I never [ __ ] drink this stuff and he
38:48 threw back a big mouthful and it must
38:51 have been I don't know really really hot
38:53 cuz he spits all over his girlfriend and
38:57 it's it's just it's this weird sound you
38:59 make when your body is actually making
39:01 you spit out of a rejection you know of
39:03 heat the more the story of those two
39:06 stories is that sometimes you have folks
39:08 that are very interested in being the
39:10 wise man or the wise woman but they
39:12 haven't quite made it yet remember what
39:16 I always say on this show
39:18 truth predicts the future everything
39:20 else is [ __ ]
39:21 so someone gives you a bunch of wisdom
39:24 in a very confident way to create
39:27 shortcuts for you but you end up either
39:30 never reaching your goal or you go
39:32 through one of the most tumultuous paths
39:34 to reach your goal you may want to
39:38 evaluate where you got your information
39:40 from right now someone tells you
39:43 straight to your face there are wise old
39:45 so when they go oh you want to do that I
39:47 yep I do I totally do you sure yeah you
39:51 know how hard it is to do that right I
39:54 think I do but obviously I don't
39:56 completely understand how hard it is
39:57 because I've never done it before I've
39:59 tried a couple times and it's been
40:01 really really tough to continue okay if
40:04 the wise soul says you're biting off one
40:08 of the biggest things you could possibly
40:09 bite off in life this is going to kick
40:11 your ass I can't give you all the
40:14 answers to get there but I can
40:16 definitely put you on the right path I
40:18 can give you a mechanism by which on a
40:21 daily basis hourly minutes second to
40:23 second basis you can continue the
40:25 process of making progress then you have
40:31 the challenge comfortably presented to
40:34 you you know what you're getting into
40:36 which can be the most exciting thing in
40:38 the world if someone tells you it's
40:40 really hard because challenges are what
40:41 define us right the hero is defined when
40:46 they make decisions under pressure
40:49 again there's that old star our Superman
40:52 movie with Christopher Reeve the very
40:53 very first one Lex Luthor launches two
40:58 ICBMs intercontinental ballistic
41:00 missiles one's gonna hit the East Coast
41:01 one's gonna hit the west coast and his
41:03 cast Barker makes him choose the East
41:08 Coast first cuz that's where her mother
41:09 lives and she's basically saying if I
41:11 get this kryptonite off your chest
41:13 you're gonna say my mother first right
41:15 when his girlfriend lives on the west
41:17 coast and that bombs gonna potentially
41:19 kill her you had to make a decision
41:22 under pressure a good writer well we set
41:25 up a really good pressurized situation
41:27 that the heroes had to respond to in
41:31 this particular scenario you are the
41:33 hero and it's pretty fun when you get
41:37 into it especially when you're
41:39 controlling your destiny now the other
41:43 thing that can occur in this line of
41:46 thinking in this line of taking action
41:48 in your life is that you might have to
41:50 do some things you don't want to do that
41:52 you might quite accurately categorize as
41:58 a waste of your time but you have to do
42:01 them because perhaps you have to pay the
42:03 bills in between your dreams being
42:05 realized right best part of your
42:09 situation those are that's part of your
42:11 dues it's unfortunate that you have to
42:14 do it but all of us typically find
42:16 ourselves in a situation from time to
42:18 time just know it's normal and know that
42:22 that unfortunately I think this is true
42:26 that the majority of the world doesn't
42:27 chase their dreams as long as you are
42:30 and you have to do the thing that
42:35 they're doing like the thing that you
42:36 don't want to do that you have
42:38 categorized as Scott dam and I have to
42:39 do this job over here I don't want to
42:41 but I got to keep my lights on gotta
42:43 keep my kids fed but I am spinning my
42:46 spare time chasing my dream the benefit
42:50 there to you the wonderful reality for
42:53 you is that you're at least you're
42:54 chasing your dream you know I had
42:58 someone tell me once
43:03 an analogy of using football which is
43:08 pretty good if I start you on the
43:10 one-yard line of your endzone you got to
43:13 take that ball all the way down the
43:14 field to the other guys endzone before
43:17 you score before you get that dream
43:18 moment fully fulfilled right now
43:23 obviously what you want to do is pick up
43:24 that ball and run your ass down there
43:26 and maybe you conceive of like a few
43:29 linemen you got a knockdown you got a
43:31 left right left right faked them out and
43:33 then you run that's what you want to
43:35 have happen and sometimes you're gonna
43:36 get those moments but as long as you can
43:39 wake up every single day of your life
43:41 and lift that ball up and move it an
43:44 inch and put it back down well just do
43:49 the math on a hundred yards you're gonna
43:52 make it you're gonna make it in your
43:53 lifetime because it isn't always going
43:56 to be an inch sometimes you're gonna
43:59 pick that ball up and run it 20 yards
44:01 and one day because you just had an
44:03 epiphany the again the clouds
44:06 disappeared you know it's like that old
44:08 song I can see clearly now the rain is
44:11 gone right bright sunshiny day I can
44:15 remember the actual name of it by the
44:18 way that song is fantastic I used to
44:20 hate it when I was a kid I listen to it
44:24 now and it's like it's like an anthem to
44:27 our world at this point you especially
44:31 if you've awakened listen to those
44:33 lyrics as a person who has become a
44:35 truther I can see clearly now the rain
44:38 is gone you know gone are the dark
44:41 clouds that used to pass me by or
44:44 something like that I can't rember the
44:45 lyrics completely but it's an amazing
44:47 song it could be our anthem some people
44:53 are very compulsive about the things
44:54 that they want and you know it's
44:59 interesting is I have some friends that
45:00 are absolutely neurotic human beings I
45:03 mean they are they're amazing to watch
45:07 but when you sit down with them and try
45:09 to have a conversation when you try to I
45:11 don't know eat dinner with them or
45:13 whatever
45:14 they seem utterly and completely
45:17 scatterbrained they can't stay on the
45:20 same subject for more than two seconds
45:22 and so I remain their friends but I
45:25 can't get terribly close because my
45:27 brain is so linear and focused that it
45:32 drives me nuts however these people are
45:35 usually very successful in their goals
45:38 and they're missing a whole usually a
45:40 whole level of social interaction
45:42 because of their personality is sort of
45:44 a repellent they're usually single
45:47 forever but they do enjoy their life in
45:51 their own particular way and again there
45:54 are people that have the social side of
45:55 things everything you could possibly
45:57 imagine the perfect spouse the perfect
45:58 kids but they don't have any sense of
46:00 success in their life and so they yearn
46:02 for what the neurotic person wants the
46:04 neurotic person yearns for what they
46:05 want again I think it's interesting life
46:10 is a bit like a dollar bill you have a
46:12 hundred cents you can spend on things
46:14 and you can't you know a fully satisfied
46:18 family life is usually a buck and a
46:21 fully satisfied career is a dollar and
46:24 so you need two bucks to get both sides
46:27 and most of us don't have any more than
46:30 a dollar so you have to balance
46:33 everything a little bit of this a little
46:35 bit of that now some people miraculously
46:37 can make can get a sale let's put that
46:40 way they get 50 percent off both sides
46:42 and they get both but boys that ever
46:45 rare right Willy Wonka didn't have a
46:49 wife you don't know who's an the wizard
46:53 from The Wizard of Oz didn't have a wife
46:55 but the do was in charge right of Oz but
47:00 how many times have you had a I don't
47:03 know your house is dirty you live by
47:06 yourself for now and you have to kick
47:10 your own ass to clean it and for a very
47:14 long time you don't you just kind of go
47:17 well I I will do it I know I will do it
47:20 because it can't continue like this
47:21 forever but I'm really busy right now
47:24 I'm making progress I'm making amazing
47:26 progress in certain areas of
47:27 life but eventually something breaks in
47:31 you and you get it cleaned and then you
47:33 really enjoy your cleaner environment if
47:38 you're like me you'll say oh my god I
47:40 just need to build a better routine in
47:42 my life such that I kind of keep things
47:46 clean as I go if I just put my keys
47:48 always right there with my wallet and my
47:50 spare cash whatever I'm carrying on me
47:52 they'll never have to search for it you
47:55 know if the towel goes here and my
47:57 clothes go here and whatever whatever
47:59 whatever new mail that's like the
48:01 biggest pain-in-the-ass right I really
48:04 get I mean I get 1% of my mail is
48:06 something I need to actually open up
48:07 save packages I'm having sent to the
48:10 house with items that I'm using to
48:11 construct something right I envy people
48:15 that have it all you know worked out
48:16 it's cool they're wise right it's easy
48:21 to get yourself isolated in such a way
48:25 that you you have a wonderful world by
48:27 yourself whatever it is and I don't mean
48:29 physically isolated you might actually
48:32 live by yourself and not have a social
48:35 circle or you could have again a whole
48:37 wife husband kids all that kind of stuff
48:40 and you still have your little microcosm
48:43 that you live in you come inside the
48:45 house eat your food you sit in the front
48:47 room your watch your favorite show you
48:48 go to bed you go out to the garage you
48:50 go to your workshop whatever your office
48:53 and even though these other people in
48:55 your life you're trying to take care of
48:58 some sort of destiny either for you or
49:01 you're in addition trying to create some
49:04 legacy for your family such that when
49:06 you at some point succeed they actually
49:10 have a franchise they can take over you
49:13 know when you look at Hollywood it's
49:14 really amazing how many people succeeded
49:17 because the parents were in the business
49:19 before them right and they're actually
49:22 good at what they do sometimes that
49:24 happens and you know it's just like how
49:27 did this horrible actor get a chance to
49:31 act you know how did this horrible
49:33 singer ever get on stage what how did
49:35 the Oh her sisters that girl who's super
49:38 popular
49:40 or their father was super popular I
49:43 think Michael Douglas and the bridges
49:45 brothers are a real good example of
49:48 fathers that taught their sons how to do
49:50 it and you know I'm assuming that their
49:54 kids and grandkids will be somewhere in
49:57 our future Kurt Russell's son is one of
50:00 the best actors I've seen in the last 10
50:04 20 years I hope he does extremely well
50:07 but my point here in closing is that
50:10 sometimes you got to get out you have to
50:13 seek wisdom some of you are really good
50:17 at seeking it online and doing email
50:20 kind of pen pal stuff that we used to do
50:23 back in the pre-internet days hey if
50:26 that works for you go for it I will say
50:29 that the amount of information you can
50:31 transfer in a conversation face to face
50:33 whether you be skyping or actually
50:36 meeting someone face to face is
50:37 exponentially higher right and the main
50:41 reason that face to face is so valuable
50:43 is that you will you'll have epiphanies
50:47 in the conversation you're talking
50:49 talking talking and everything an email
50:51 is very linear right it's like I am
50:53 trying not to waste your time I'm asking
50:55 you very specific questions and you'll
50:57 get a little digressions here in there
50:58 and you change back and forth in your
51:00 threads but at some point you just get
51:01 tired of typing but if you're sitting
51:04 down relaxing you know my running mentor
51:08 and I if we wrote emails it's pretty
51:11 sparse because it takes a long time and
51:14 he and I both are writers and so we try
51:16 to make our emails tiny little
51:18 masterpieces of communication because
51:20 that's just our nature but when I go to
51:22 eat lunch with them I get 10 times as
51:28 much in a little burger and a cocktail
51:32 right you know and let me just throw
51:35 this particular little epiphany in here
51:38 because I've thought about trying to
51:39 create an episode about this but I think
51:41 it's hard to format this particular
51:44 piece of wisdom you've heard me say
51:48 thousands of times on this show
51:51 sometimes you just need someone
51:53 remind you that this is something you
51:56 need to do something you need to think
51:58 of right isn't that weird but that's the
52:04 truth it's definitely the truth for me
52:07 sometimes someone just needs to say oh
52:09 you're trying to build something
52:11 electronic hmm you should go find some
52:17 people that know which you need to know
52:19 and get the information that you need
52:25 for me I'm walking into this new group
52:28 that I found a full-blown engineer in
52:30 software and so it might be that the
52:33 commodity that I bring is the software
52:36 engineering side of things in fact I
52:38 watched a presentation of a gentleman
52:39 who had created a pretty cool we use
52:44 electronic menorah and so he wanted to
52:48 create something that stood in his
52:50 window and then it was all made of LEDs
52:52 and it would go through the sequence of
52:54 the days and it was really brilliantly
52:56 put together using these new pixel LEDs
53:01 these neopixels there's trying to get
53:03 real popular in this electronics group
53:06 but he's an older gentleman and I
53:08 watched I looked at his code and I could
53:11 see that there were ways of taking 30
53:15 lines of code and making it probably
53:17 four and at some point when I get to
53:21 know the group a little bit better I
53:23 might offer my skill set in there to say
53:25 why don't you send me that that our jury
53:27 knows skit and let me see if I can't
53:29 optimize this for you right I couldn't
53:33 bring my computer that day and just do
53:35 it right in front of his face but he did
53:39 get the job done and that's what's super
53:41 cool so when you first create something
53:43 and first invent something a lot of
53:46 times you'll create what we call the
53:47 Frankenstein version of it and then
53:48 eventually you refine it and it becomes
53:50 something beautiful the thing I'm going
53:53 to create what I've already started is
53:55 that I'm going to be creating something
53:57 that's probably hundreds of dollars for
53:59 the prototype and eventually I'm gonna
54:02 take it to experts and say look I need
54:03 to make this 5-volt thing run
54:06 1.5 volts if possible and I need to
54:10 shrink the price of this this this this
54:13 this and this and then it becomes
54:16 affordable for a consumer we all gain
54:19 wisdom as we live our lives where that
54:22 whether or not we are still neurotic or
54:24 whether or not we're you know less than
54:29 50 percent efficient with our life we
54:31 still have these moments these things
54:33 right there all the life hack videos on
54:37 YouTube which are little videos of
54:41 wisdom now someone's saying well you
54:46 know you want to get a ring off a finger
54:47 that is swollen because the ring was too
54:50 small or the person hasn't taken it off
54:51 in years or someone put someone else's
54:54 ring on you know starts to accumulate
54:57 blood on this side of the finger and
54:58 therefore blocking the ring to come off
55:00 this is a really cool trick where these
55:02 guys would they take string they lube up
55:05 the finger with butter they take string
55:07 I feed it underneath the the ring and
55:11 they simply pull the string off the
55:14 finger and it creates an assembly line
55:16 of like a conveyor belt of sorts to pull
55:21 the ring off the finger and it just
55:22 falls off the finger and everything's
55:24 fine the ring doesn't have to be cut up
55:26 the finger doesn't get injured there's
55:28 immediate relief and you know you tell
55:31 the subject don't ever do that again
55:33 those are gems when I grew up in the
55:36 Midwest it was probably 20 years behind
55:40 the rest of the United States in terms
55:42 of architecture technology etc it got
55:46 much better in the in the 80s and again
55:48 we had these whiz kids in town that
55:50 would take technology for the rest of
55:52 the country 20 years in the future it
55:54 was just weird how in these weird
55:57 sterile environments we are in the
55:59 middle of nowhere we're a hundred miles
56:01 from any major city in all directions
56:03 north I'll seat north-south-east-west
56:05 and yet we had these like unbelievable
56:09 geniuses and electronics crazy how that
56:12 happens right but the cool thing about
56:15 growing up in this sort of time capsule
56:18 of the past was that wisdom was
56:21 everywhere it was it was almost as if he
56:25 reached a certain age and depending on
56:28 your engagement with adults and your
56:29 maturity they would teach you as soon as
56:32 you showed the intellectual prowess to
56:34 take on the information and you would be
56:39 adopted by these old guys I was a dude
56:41 so I didn't get too much from the women
56:43 but you'd be adopted by these older men
56:45 in that you know you want to learn how
56:49 to fish well I expect you to be here
56:51 every Saturday between these two time
56:55 tables and I'm gonna teach you the
56:57 difference between bass fishing trout
57:00 fishing catfish fishing and I'm gonna
57:04 teach you about how turtles work on this
57:06 pond of mine because they're gonna eat
57:08 your fish if you try to hang them off
57:09 the dock unless you do this this and
57:12 this you know I told you about the wood
57:14 carving idea with my grandfather amazing
57:17 you walk in there and in the funny thing
57:19 is is you'll find kids that are loudly
57:20 younger than you that know the tricks so
57:23 my challenge to you guys is this if
57:25 you've been sitting on an idea for a
57:28 long time you got it in your heart in
57:30 your soul and you can't stop it you
57:32 can't stop thinking about it
57:33 yearning for it what I want you to do is
57:37 to reevaluate the dream make sure you
57:42 still have complete interest in doing it
57:44 and realize that sometimes what you need
57:46 to do is engage the dream to figure out
57:48 whether or not it is a dream you want to
57:50 keep
57:50 it's totally productive in life to say I
57:54 think I want to learn the guitar and so
57:58 you get a little cheapy guitar and you
58:01 take some lessons in the genre of music
58:03 that you want to learn don't don't go
58:05 off and learn crap you don't ever want
58:06 to play because you'll quit the art of
58:09 playing guitar because you're playing
58:10 stupid stuff right get into exactly what
58:13 you want practice practice practice
58:16 and if you decide this is gonna take way
58:19 longer than I want to invest and you
58:21 stop you sell that guitar or give it to
58:24 someone who wants to get into it you've
58:26 at least extinguished in your soul that
58:30 that particular dream is
58:31 not one that you're really interested in
58:33 and you go to the next one because most
58:36 people have a next one trust me so I
58:39 want you to reevaluate your dreams and
58:41 then I want you to find someone with the
58:44 skillset and the wisdom of what you want
58:49 to do and you might find yourself like I
58:54 was yesterday going from sort of this
58:57 hunt and pecking Google exercise online
59:01 to immediate solutions this guy was like
59:06 you're looking for this boom it was
59:09 right there and again all I'm doing is
59:12 telling you what you have to do it's
59:14 what I do
59:15 right even I forget that I need to seek
59:18 out other people sometimes now sometimes
59:21 I want to tell you about a sort of an
59:28 unfortunate situation that I recently
59:29 run into it ran into with someone that I
59:31 was trying to help because I don't want
59:35 you to do this I ran into a gentleman
59:39 who has devoted last 7 years of his life
59:42 to writing screenplays and obviously
59:46 yours truly has been in that business
59:48 for at least 11 years very seriously
59:51 he didn't formally trained by some
59:53 geniuses both from a mentorship level to
59:57 Robert McKee and his course which I
59:59 devoured inside and out having spent the
60:03 20 years before that from 87 to 2007
60:06 writing as a novice not knowing exactly
60:09 the pieces and parts that I have to
60:11 address to write a great script having
60:14 these visions of grandeur of walking
60:16 into a studio and selling a script
60:18 without knowing what the hell I'm doing
60:19 right well I was introduced to this
60:23 person and I interviewed him I asked him
60:26 tons of questions I was able to prove to
60:28 myself that he does have some great
60:30 ideas he doesn't write in any
60:33 professional software that was the first
60:35 sign that any any scoffed at the fact of
60:38 using professional software which is
60:40 very very important because it does all
60:43 the work for you
60:44 if you're wasting your time inside of
60:47 products like Microsoft Word writing a
60:50 script and I say look we don't write
60:52 that particular thing in the script ever
60:54 in a professional piece of software you
60:56 uncheck a checkbox and they're all
60:58 removed from your script in two seconds
60:59 and a non-professional piece of software
61:02 you're doing a fine and replace and
61:03 you're screwing it the form out of your
61:04 script this person had visions of
61:08 grandeur as high as they could go
61:11 meeting the most renowned directors in
61:14 the world to sell his scripts hey it can
61:17 happen it can happen so I happen to have
61:21 contacts that are exactly what he needs
61:23 to get his career started I mean tippy
61:26 top agents that are connected to
61:31 agencies that are the biggest agencies
61:33 in the world fact the biggest agency in
61:35 the world which were main nameless
61:38 within ten minutes I was able to send a
61:42 text message find out that the guy that
61:44 he needs to talk to is actually on his
61:46 way to our location within five minutes
61:50 this person walks in the door and I said
61:52 that's him we're gonna sit down and talk
61:54 to him but you need to pitch your own
61:56 [ __ ] right I'm not here to hold your
61:57 hand right you have these visions of
62:00 grandeur of talking to the biggest
62:01 directors who are alive today so you're
62:04 gonna have to nut up and prove that
62:05 you've got the ability to communicate
62:06 you're a writer that's what you do after
62:11 about ten minutes my buddy sat down next
62:15 to this guy and I'm looking at him I'm
62:18 like there he is I didn't make the
62:19 introduction I said and I make I set the
62:21 whole premise up I said he's got scripts
62:23 that think he thinks would be very
62:25 helpful to this director I know that's a
62:27 huge thing but can you hook him up and
62:32 to my shock my buddy the contact said
62:36 yeah I know the people that are his
62:39 agents they're just down the hallway
62:42 this is how much juice is in this room
62:46 so they were watching TV and I'm waiting
62:49 and I'm waiting and I'm waiting for this
62:53 guy to start talking to the guy he's
62:55 sitting right next to nothing
62:58 zero so I'm like okay he's shy he's shy
63:02 are you maybe you know geniuses are shy
63:04 sometimes
63:04 so I thread the conversation together
63:07 one more time I take on the role of the
63:10 guy sitting next to me you're supposed
63:12 to be talking to guy next to him who's
63:13 my contact
63:15 nothing I totally set it up again
63:18 nothing then I just basically say well I
63:22 got to go I've been here all day I got
63:23 to get out of here
63:24 so I leave then I follow up through text
63:27 messages and I find out that apparently
63:30 they set up a meeting it's supposed to
63:32 occur in about three days it is the
63:34 meeting that every writer in the world
63:36 would want to have I mean the most
63:38 coveted special moment on planet earth
63:43 so I'm excited I then bump into this guy
63:49 another two or three times and so now
63:51 I'm sitting there going okay
63:52 have you ever I know that he doesn't
63:55 know anything about Robert McKee very
63:57 important because Robert McKee defined
64:01 the vocabulary of Hollywood if you do
64:03 not know his vocabulary you're dead in
64:05 the water when you go in for an
64:07 interview about your writing
64:08 capabilities because they're gonna use
64:09 words that we don't normally use in
64:11 English language and so I start telling
64:15 well this guy starts to do something
64:19 that I see all the time especially
64:21 novices which is to say something to the
64:24 effect of oh yeah yeah I totally know
64:25 that oh yeah oh yeah that's easy that's
64:27 tell ya I tell you know that I said okay
64:31 I having the wisdom that I have in this
64:35 particular area of the world said all
64:38 right why don't you give me your three
64:40 sentence pitch for the script that we've
64:42 been talking about for the last three
64:44 days and the first sentence it's got to
64:46 be good enough to get the person to read
64:49 the second sentence the second sentence
64:51 has to be good enough to get them to
64:52 read the third sentence since by the
64:53 time they're done with the third
64:54 sentence they are completely aware of
64:58 what the hell you're pitching
65:03 intellectual cricket started happening
65:05 right you could do it we have something
65:08 in script writing we call the
65:10 controlling idea again it's a Robert
65:12 McKee phrase it is the key phrase that
65:14 you must communicate which is the
65:16 overall theme and arc of your entire
65:18 script back in the old Greek theater
65:20 days one would have said something like
65:23 love conquers all
65:25 good always Vic you know this victorious
65:28 over evil but we don't say those anymore
65:31 because those are all cliche you must
65:33 bring something much more insightful
65:36 original which will control every word
65:39 in your entire script from the very
65:41 first page to the last page nothing I'm
65:45 like okay well that's very hard those
65:47 are really hard things to come up with
65:48 so I brought up my 17 treatments that
65:53 I'm working on right now and so I
65:55 started reading mine to him did you see
65:57 how that worked three sentences you told
65:59 you know what that scripts about oh yeah
66:00 that's easy that's easy it's easy right
66:02 so I start being the controlling ideas
66:04 oh that's easy that's easy that's easy
66:08 well wouldn't you know it he didn't make
66:12 his meeting he was asked to submit
66:15 material to the agent so that he could
66:18 get him the meeting and feel confident
66:21 about not bringing in a dud and there
66:23 was no reply not only didn't deliver the
66:27 material but didn't reply the meeting
66:30 never happened I continued to follow up
66:33 their text messages with my buddy who's
66:35 the agent saying did this guy ever
66:37 follow up with you anything so he was
66:40 sorry
66:41 he's more time no-nothing and the weird
66:45 thing is that that guy continues to show
66:47 up where I show up the guy that failed
66:49 and doesn't mention anything about
66:51 completely failing he's a full time
66:54 writer retired spends all of his money
66:57 on surviving while he is trying to
67:00 become a writer he got the opportunity
67:02 of a lifetime
67:03 and completely and utterly blew it this
67:07 is why people think that a lot of times
67:13 they'll come out here to succeed and
67:14 they'll go home and they'll
67:16 lame the system they'll blame la for
67:19 their failures but it was really their
67:24 failure like I always say luck is often
67:29 defined in Hollywood is a [ __ ] ton of
67:31 hard work and determination and
67:34 perseverance right just like a World of
67:36 Warcraft guys say all the time and the
67:38 merchants say that in my definition is
67:41 luck can only be really acquired in the
67:44 opportunity which is exactly what
67:46 happened in this particular situation
67:47 the individual expressed to me his
67:51 desire to be a writer professionally
67:54 unlike me he's able to work on it
67:56 full-time seven years in a row I have
67:59 never been in that situation for
68:01 anything more than maybe a year and a
68:02 half when I've saved up a stack of money
68:04 and I write but usually I'm writing
68:07 while I have some other career and so I
68:13 sent a text message and got him the luck
68:16 to talk this individual but like I
68:19 always say on the show you got to bring
68:20 the skills and he didn't have them he
68:24 can get them but if he constantly tells
68:25 himself that's easy that's easy that's
68:27 easy well he's got an intellectual
68:29 barrier between him and his skill set
68:31 getting to that upper level if he
68:34 minimizes things like professional
68:35 writing software he's always going to go
68:38 in looking like a novice when they say
68:40 send me your script and he sends it in a
68:41 Word file right so the interesting thing
68:48 is I finally been able to get the ball
68:52 rolling from my own meeting with my same
68:55 contact there's various logistic reasons
68:59 why it's taking so long to get this set
69:01 up
69:04 but I'm bringing the skills and it's
69:07 still gonna be hard as hell to get it to
69:09 succeed right like I said in my making
69:13 it in Hollywood episode which isn't all
69:17 just about Hollywood folks it's about
69:19 life in general how you have to approach
69:21 your dreams in general the people that
69:24 you're going to talk to in life and all
69:26 areas of life not just Hollywood folks
69:28 but all areas you're gonna go in and
69:30 talk to a CEO of a company they're the
69:33 founder of the company in a lot of cases
69:35 or the company is so gigantic that's
69:38 it's 80 years old and if you're talking
69:42 to the person that has been elected to
69:44 run that business then you're obviously
69:46 not talking to some Schmo you're talking
69:49 to a genius and so in most cases 98% of
69:54 the time right every once in a while
69:55 it's the owner's son and or whatever
69:58 daughter and they don't know what the
69:59 hell they're doing that's so rare that's
70:01 so freakin rare cuz they get kicked out
70:04 so fast it's not even funny so what they
70:09 want to see in you is wisdom and wisdom
70:14 in an interview like that will go
70:16 something like this if you are in an
70:19 interview to get what you want in life
70:21 and you're coming from a novice
70:24 standpoint you're going to say things
70:28 it's going to reveal your remedial
70:31 thinking now sometimes that's what
70:34 they're looking for right sometimes for
70:36 instance there's the Twilight Zone in
70:38 the fourth season with the guys a toy
70:41 maker then he's in his 30s and he is a
70:46 child but he's 40 years old 30 he
70:49 supposed to be 36 in the script whatever
70:51 but they like him in the company because
70:54 he has in a little bit of adult Ennis to
70:57 him but what they really wants the child
70:58 is nature in him to see what children
71:00 really want and he's extremely good at
71:02 it right and so those are the exceptions
71:07 but most cases they want to see someone
71:09 who can execute beautifully and keep the
71:12 company profitable it's all about money
71:15 in any company if you have
71:17 to be you can't pay people's rents
71:19 insurance and keep a building open
71:22 without generating a profit I know you
71:25 feel me but I want to throw that one at
71:27 the last second because it was it was
71:29 really educational for me and I've
71:32 passed the story around a couple friends
71:33 of mine as an example of you know how it
71:36 works and everyone's like yeah yeah I've
71:39 been there I've seen that before right
71:40 if you haven't been to deep thoughts
71:42 radio.com please go it will guide you in
71:45 all the right directions if you're
71:47 watching this on a random YouTube moment
71:48 but you'd rather have this in your car
71:50 as a podcast it's all up there
71:51 audio/video locked Facebook group case
71:54 you want to get into some really cool
71:55 discussions and see some pretty good
71:58 trains of thought up there and all kinds
72:00 of different stuff politics to science
72:02 to philosophy
72:03 it's just littered with cool posts if
72:07 you want to support the show there is a
72:08 patreon page which is a apparatus where
72:12 you can donate a dollar a month or
72:14 whatever I am feeding this full of
72:16 previews of these episodes before they
72:18 get released on YouTube so you know take
72:22 care of yourself in someone else I'm not
72:23 seeing the next deep thoughts over now
