00:00 [Music]
00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen coming coming to you from the
00:39 lounge again it's just felt like it's
00:43 always better lighting feel like getting
00:46 out of the house so tonight's episode is
00:49 going to be a listener request and I'd
00:53 had this request it's from our friend of
00:55 mine very close friend of mine I'm near
00:57 and dear to and she said you know you
01:01 should do a video about this phenomenon
01:04 about people wanting to be right all the
01:06 time
01:07 and her and I've discussed this at
01:09 length and it just has to do with that
01:12 when that situation and when social
01:14 media came online we started to show our
01:19 inner psychosis I talked about this in
01:21 my facebook episode the reasons why you
01:24 post right the couple that posts all the
01:27 time would say somebody loves me look
01:29 I'm okay so I'm really you don't know me
01:31 but this person loves me and look how
01:32 pretty they are so I'm cool the people
01:35 that constantly post my life is better
01:37 than yours
01:38 with those two posts you will have if
01:41 you were to eliminate all those posts
01:43 out of social media on all platforms I'm
01:46 willing to bet that more than 60% of all
01:48 the posts in the world would simply
01:50 vanish and I think that the number one
01:52 species left would be I'm right and
01:56 you're wrong and it's a tough one right
02:01 because at some points you see people we
02:03 got a bunch of people who are sleeping
02:04 the world and we've done our research at
02:07 least enough to find enough smoking guns
02:09 and whatever subject matter we're
02:10 talking about to know that they can't
02:12 keep their history that's one category
02:14 of it all then we have sort of the ultra
02:17 subjective subject matter you know who's
02:22 bad who's good very specific things like
02:25 abortion in these ultra polarizing
02:28 things whether or not you know it's
02:32 absolutely larious even though socialism
02:35 has failed in every single experiment on
02:37 earth these people still think without
02:39 any deep thinking about the post-mortems
02:43 on all these countries that failed we
02:44 can just start a back up again in cortes
02:46 with her single
02:47 the Jedi Q is going to be right there on
02:49 the forefront leading the charge and
02:52 getting it right but I think before
02:54 social media came out of course this
02:56 whole thing about being right has been
02:58 around forever right I gotta stop saying
03:01 right after every thing I say but where
03:05 did it come from
03:06 what's the genealogy of this feeling of
03:11 we want to be right such that other
03:15 people are wrong it's almost like you
03:18 don't have the full hai of the moment
03:20 unless someone is is proven wrong by you
03:24 being right it's a really strange thing
03:27 well let's think about a caveman primal
03:30 being getting something bright we see it
03:34 in monkeys we see it in all kinds of
03:35 different species on this planet they
03:37 get elated when attempting over and over
03:40 and over again fails and then boom the
03:43 Acorn Falls BAM I got it and now every
03:45 time I come back to this birdseed thing
03:48 or whatever I can always take as much as
03:51 I want now the wild it's pretty
03:54 interesting because unless wild animal
03:56 is interacting with a new object that
03:57 man has made that must be deciphered by
04:00 the animal it looks like all the animals
04:02 insects have got it totally figured out
04:03 they know where to eat they know what
04:05 their prey is they know what the prey on
04:07 them is composed of they know where to
04:10 get their food they know what a migrate
04:12 it's been millions and millions of years
04:14 of whatever they are
04:16 it's ironed out but man oh we're the
04:21 dominant species we're the toolmaker and
04:23 therefore we create a brand new
04:27 challenges brand new truths and so we
04:32 have this dilemma every single one of
04:34 you can remember being a child and you
04:38 are alone for whatever reason you're in
04:40 your room and your crib you're playing
04:43 around with your toys you're trying to
04:45 figure something out remember the first
04:46 toy that taught cognitive sciences to a
04:49 child it was a little workbench with all
04:54 the different shaped holes and then you
04:57 had a peg that had the cross-section of
05:00 that
05:01 particular design the circle the square
05:05 the Pentagon whatever hexagon and you
05:10 pounded him through the star all that
05:12 crazy crap maybe a half moon or
05:13 something and boy when you figured it
05:16 out
05:16 you felt amazing the donuts that you
05:20 lined up on that little donut spool
05:22 spindle you so let's put the biggest one
05:24 at the bottom to get the tallest one or
05:27 narrowest one at the top it felt amazing
05:30 now we as human beings have lost this
05:34 for the most part in modern worlds this
05:37 understanding of having to go out hunt
05:40 for your food potentially lose one of
05:42 the village potentially get bitten come
05:46 back wounded lose the limb whatever
05:49 we've lost all the reality of what it
05:51 takes to actually survive on this planet
05:52 because we've managed to create
05:54 processes where we raise livestock and
05:57 we don't necessarily have to eat a lion
05:59 right so we never to mess with them they
06:01 just sit out there in the Sarah or by
06:02 themselves right I should say Safari but
06:06 what happens when you do it by yourself
06:09 you get something right by yourself you
06:11 feel absolutely empowered to repeat that
06:13 step as much as you want to entertain
06:15 yourself and that's pretty much before
06:18 we learn the other formula that's where
06:20 it stays and then if your parents are
06:23 sort of cool parents and you do some
06:26 things correct in front of them they
06:28 know that positive reinforcement it's
06:31 how you get a child to behave when they
06:34 do something that you don't want them to
06:35 do you offer nothing if they do
06:37 something that would normally have hurt
06:38 them maybe you pat their diaper and hey
06:41 we're gonna do that right no touch all
06:43 right all right I love you but well they
06:47 do something great they get a straight-a
06:49 or they get a on a test they they go to
06:54 potty for the first time and take care
06:56 of all the mess boy that's a moment
06:59 where you give some super alkyl aids
07:02 that's where it starts I did something
07:05 right and I got a reward and that feels
07:08 good
07:08 it's the dopamine triggers in your
07:10 brains in your brain that
07:14 gives you that gambling algorithm that
07:18 that sort of reward mechanism and so
07:22 that sort of stays in your local
07:24 ecosystem until you're about five or six
07:26 and then you start venturing out into
07:28 the world right and then you do
07:30 something that perhaps really helps some
07:32 people and now the outside public gives
07:36 you the accolade they see you've done an
07:38 amazing job and now you feel even better
07:41 it's even better than the accolade you
07:44 got from your parents have you ever had
07:47 a situation where you again some of you
07:50 were really close to your parents and
07:51 this still works and god bless you
07:53 you're very fortunate but you need an
07:57 alkyl aid outside of your parents you
08:00 know I was I was pretty bored of my
08:06 parents you know compliments at a young
08:10 age and and they weren't even that you
08:14 know they weren't crazy with it they
08:15 didn't say it every time it happened but
08:16 there was just something about getting
08:18 it outside of my parental units because
08:20 I thought well my parents have to like
08:22 what I do is almost a subconscious
08:23 thought no one really says it to your
08:25 face but you get that feeling right when
08:27 you get it from outside your family it
08:30 feels better doesn't it a lot of times
08:33 at least so that starts to become a more
08:36 from a it's a little bit different than
08:39 a psychological one with yourself are
08:41 the very small socialistic experiment
08:43 with your family becomes a much more
08:45 global socialistic thing where you're
08:49 outside you with the entire world and
08:52 you know quite frankly you can make a
08:54 video on YouTube and prove up us down
08:58 and down is up and if you do it all
09:00 these people rush in and man you're your
09:02 star even if most the rule doesn't
09:06 believe in what you're saying maybe a
09:07 million people give you a thumbs up and
09:09 say you are a freaking genius I never
09:12 realized that and they proceeded to
09:15 spill their coffee all over themselves
09:17 but where does it cross that acidic line
09:19 that acidic line where you go I'm gonna
09:23 feel so much better telling someone else
09:25 that they're wrong
09:27 and when you first get into this and I'm
09:30 I'm almost certain that I'm guilty of
09:33 probably every single gradient of this
09:36 sin on man and my youth I think being
09:42 inside using that discussion boards or
09:43 whatever I think I can remember one time
09:46 when I actually wrote almost as a
09:48 tongue-in-cheek method but I'm sure it
09:49 was read a different way
09:50 you know someone was saying something I
09:52 can remotely remember what they were
09:54 talking about but I wrote the word wrong
09:56 you know in all caps comma did it and
09:59 said something else you know
10:01 reprehensible behavior by yours truly
10:03 and this close friend of mine she was
10:07 the one that got me to wake up to that
10:10 pattern in myself and others and so it's
10:14 been instrumental in me becoming a
10:16 better human being what is it why do we
10:20 have to dominate someone else hmm well
10:24 I'm gonna take a stab at this I think
10:28 that the very first time that we feel
10:30 passionate about telling someone else
10:32 that they're wrong is because deep deep
10:34 down in our heart of hearts before we
10:37 grow up and realize that there's other
10:38 perspectives on things we believe
10:41 someone is categorically wrong about
10:43 something and not only categorically
10:45 wrong but it has a little catalyst on
10:48 top of that we think that if anyone else
10:51 follows their advice or believes the way
10:53 they believe that they will hurt others
10:56 I hate to give examples in some cases we
11:02 have a real easy one
11:03 for me I think that anyone who promotes
11:06 climate change is a person incapable of
11:09 doing research extremely gullible
11:12 completely asleep
11:13 definitely not woke has no idea what the
11:16 word oligarchy means globalism the
11:21 problem reaction solution formula I
11:25 personally believe the research that
11:27 says that this is going to be a carbon
11:29 taxation taxation system to hinder
11:32 procreation on this planet turning it
11:35 into an absolutely draconian Orwellian
11:38 thx 138
11:41 world okay most of you see my episode on
11:44 global warming which they haven't D
11:45 monetized yet pretty hilarious that's
11:48 why I don't use the H word on that one
11:50 but now what am I actually doing if I
11:53 engage this faux pas that we're talking
11:57 about I go in and I very cocky cockily I
12:02 guess there's a word for that
12:04 get in there and tell someone off you
12:07 [ __ ] idiot don't you know this is but
12:10 your children are gonna suffer Wow
12:14 well an acidic person showed up left a
12:18 sentence that regardless of its giving
12:20 you the cure to cancer no one's gonna
12:22 want to read that and they're gonna
12:24 think you're a completely immature
12:26 incapable person of debating well and I
12:30 want to give some props out to again the
12:32 folks on our locked Facebook group you
12:35 guys are and gals are truly first-class
12:39 human beings because the way you guys
12:40 converse with each other and I know that
12:43 what's beautiful is is like we've got
12:46 round earth and flatter people living in
12:49 harmony and everyone laughs at each
12:51 other's jokes it's like someone says I
12:53 you think is flat but this is obviously
12:55 round thing and this is round and
12:57 obviously it's flat I mean it's just
12:58 beautiful I one lives together it's
13:00 awesome it's kind of a daily example of
13:02 how well things can be worded and I
13:04 learned just by reading your words how
13:06 not to do this right so I think that one
13:09 of the tipping points is that we truly
13:10 do honestly believe that there's a
13:12 problem here that the other person is
13:15 representing heresy
13:16 now let's Pierce and divide heresy a
13:22 little at least into two sections one of
13:26 them might be something we believe to be
13:28 very scientific again when the head
13:31 meteorologist at MIT said that the
13:34 percentage of co2 in the atmosphere was
13:36 Oh point zero five four percent of a
13:38 single percent all the greenhouse gases
13:40 in the atmosphere we know he's talking
13:43 about literally nothing that's all of it
13:46 and then when you take out the two and a
13:49 half percent which is the highest amount
13:51 of what man contributes to that
13:53 infinitesimal amount
13:55 then we realize there's nothing to worry
13:56 about we can go ahead and clean up the
13:58 world get rid of oil rebirthed s lens of
14:01 the [ __ ] school so everyone can learn
14:03 how to make electricity out of ether
14:05 wins but when you think you've got
14:07 empirical data like that and people are
14:09 messing around and playing around with
14:11 things that are going to disturb every
14:13 person on earth and again
14:15 prevent people from having a second
14:17 child hmm I think that probably the most
14:22 sovereign thing that we can do on this
14:24 planet besides have the right to not be
14:28 harmed with common law right do no harm
14:30 is to bear children to have children
14:34 with someone else if you're a guy to
14:37 protect and raise another soul into this
14:40 universe to make them a wonderful happy
14:42 contributing human being and so to have
14:45 that particular sovereignty destroyed by
14:49 you know this this absolute mental
14:52 patient Cortes and all her backers
14:55 Oliver Greendale backers whew that does
14:59 warm the blood a little bit doesn't it
15:00 but now let's go to the other side an
15:04 opinion an opinion that we believe is
15:07 fact now again the easiest ways I can
15:12 compliment every single listener on this
15:13 show is to tolerate my beliefs and any
15:18 expression of religion whether it be the
15:20 lack of traditional religion or my
15:22 existential religion that I'm constantly
15:25 professing on the show
15:26 there are obviously hundreds of people
15:29 if not thousands of people subscribe to
15:31 this channel who believe that Jesus
15:32 Christ existed came to this world died
15:34 for our sins and is now part of the Holy
15:37 Trinity that will forge a path to heaven
15:41 I respect that 100 percent 100 percent I
15:45 wouldn't be totally disappointed if I
15:48 got to this unease and you were wrong
15:49 dude be like oh my god you're a knife I
15:52 buddy you go psych the churches and
15:56 methods are believing how the universe
15:58 was put together who your Creator is all
16:00 that kind of stuff you got the Catholics
16:02 you have the the you know the Mormons
16:06 you might have
16:08 Jehovah's Witness you know they're all
16:10 kind of going for the same pot then you
16:11 have the nondenomination and get the
16:13 Baptist and the Methodist and
16:15 Episcopalians and all these different
16:17 flavors of the same religion but they
16:19 don't believe the same thing within
16:21 their congregation as I always say not
16:23 everyone believes the Bible the same way
16:25 I've never met I think it's in a
16:27 physical impossibility find two people
16:29 standing in any one place to believe the
16:31 Bible identically because it depends on
16:34 how many times you've read it how you've
16:36 interpreted it how old you were when you
16:38 read it last time you read it
16:40 your experiences in life that prove or
16:43 disprove its truth in your life but
16:46 there's uh that's just Christianity
16:48 that's the smallest religion one of the
16:51 smallest religions on this planet I
16:52 should say and then you have the Muslim
16:56 nation you know and again Eastern
16:59 Christianity is different than Western
17:00 Christianity completely different take
17:02 on all the original sin and all that but
17:06 that's where I get a fair amount of
17:09 comments and how you've seen fair amount
17:11 of comments outside this channel for
17:13 people that are deathly terrified for my
17:16 soul again I think it best are at worst
17:19 excuse me God will just judge me as a
17:21 human being and make his decision his
17:25 intent is sin nothing else right but now
17:29 those are two fairly rational categories
17:31 write a technical truth that you believe
17:33 in and you believe someone else is
17:34 contradicting your Technic technical
17:36 truth and then you have this spiritual
17:37 belief system which you believe people
17:39 might be lost and die without going to
17:42 the afterlife you don't want to miss
17:44 them in the afterlife and so you know
17:47 what would heaven be if your kids didn't
17:49 come with you what would have them be if
17:50 your loved one didn't come with you so
17:51 you start get worried about that and at
17:53 least in those scenarios when you're
17:55 crossing the line and perhaps being a
17:57 lot more offensive than you normally
18:00 would be in a comment you've got
18:03 something to at least lean on we all
18:05 kind of understand but I think the one
18:09 that my friends talking about the most
18:10 is this irrational one and I think it
18:15 goes something like this after years and
18:18 years of the first two categories
18:20 one simply gains this dopamine trigger
18:24 addiction a lot like a one-armed bandit
18:27 all right a slot machine boom
18:30 maybe I win except in their mind every
18:33 time they pull that damn thing they win
18:35 and the only random thing that's going
18:38 on inside the tumblers for our metaphor
18:41 is looking up the feed in your social
18:45 media your Twitter or your Facebook
18:49 mainly right where people can write
18:50 comments about things that are really
18:53 related to issues instagrams pretty cool
18:55 because it's just hey I took a picture
18:57 take a look it's my life it's good but
19:00 they get addicted I'm right and you're
19:04 wrong that is the formula where it's
19:07 almost like those fill in the blank
19:09 stories we used to have those kids
19:11 always forget what the hell those are
19:12 called but you just fill in the blank
19:15 you know they said this I said this
19:16 while they're wrong whoo give yourself a
19:19 paycheck pat yourself on the back to me
19:22 I think what's being revealed with this
19:25 subject matter can be also
19:27 metaphorically described as and only
19:30 some of you're gonna get this but even
19:33 they got even they kids today actually
19:35 do this one little funny thing but let
19:37 me tell you when a word processor came
19:40 out in a visual GUI form with a
19:42 graphical user interface on the
19:44 Macintosh and you realized you could
19:46 write a letter and you could change the
19:48 font of every word of every sentence
19:52 whatever you want to do every character
19:53 in a word make it look like a ransom
19:55 letter you did it you did all these
19:58 crazy fonts and you printed it out and
20:00 you sent it off to all your relatives
20:01 and you're essentially saying look at
20:03 this crazy thing I can do well what do I
20:07 start this episode out with a couple
20:09 reasons that I think are fairly foolish
20:11 as to why we post on social media we're
20:16 revealing our most insecure psychoses
20:20 when we post the the one that kills me
20:24 it's a hilarious
20:25 these people that got married [ __ ] 20
20:29 years ago and all they do is post their
20:30 wedding photos over and over and over
20:33 and over like anyone gives a [ __ ] at
20:35 this point I mean if you look at their
20:37 upload photo album it's like a hundred
20:39 versions of the same exact photograph
20:41 okay you got married
20:43 great now keep it to yourself would you
20:45 I mean I'm not trying to be a humbug
20:47 about your marriage but Jesus what's
20:49 going on your life
20:50 why don't you post something that's
20:51 happening today move on move on let's go
20:53 let's go right stop using all those
20:55 fonts in the word processor we're way
20:58 past that in a level of social media
20:59 maturity it used to be acceptable to
21:02 post a photograph of yourself and a
21:04 profile that's you know 20 years old -
21:07 yeah 30 year reunions coming up you post
21:10 a photograph when you're 25 trying to
21:13 make everyone feel like you're still
21:14 have your optimal weight and you got no
21:16 wrinkles and anything but your hairdos
21:18 all high and wrinkled up and you got an
21:20 acid-washed jacket on we don't do that
21:23 anymore do we or whoever is is probably
21:26 not posting much on social media when
21:28 I'm gonna continue going with a few
21:30 little examples here because I think
21:32 this will make sense more about sort of
21:34 where we go from here
21:35 it's most likely painfully obvious to a
21:37 lot of you when video games came online
21:43 like I just covered World of Warcraft
21:45 back in 2004 when it came on we had kids
21:49 jumping into communal chat for the very
21:52 first time in their life from nine year
21:54 olds to 12 year olds and what did they
21:58 do well a bunch of them from the Midwest
22:00 went around using racial slurs sexual
22:04 orientation slurs it was every other
22:06 word out of their mouth hmm I bet if you
22:11 visited today very few of them would
22:13 hang on to that but what happened to
22:15 those folks well I can tell you by
22:17 watching them myself
22:19 they were kicked out of the group's
22:20 kicked out of the guilds and basically
22:23 banished
22:24 when while started to the report this
22:27 user feature which is very clearly quick
22:29 at the beginning there they started
22:31 losing their ability to log into the
22:33 game they got banned they'd have to
22:36 start a brand new account and a
22:37 different name and move in from there
22:40 but once you run into those penalties in
22:43 life right you got a bit of an issue
22:47 you learn I put a graphic I know I put
22:52 on the MK ULTRA radio Facebook page I'm
22:54 pretty sure I've reposted it inside the
22:56 deep thoughts Facebook page
22:58 I'll make sure before this episode comes
23:00 out that it's up there but it's a funny
23:03 little graphic I made about Facebook
23:06 creating this drop-down list that before
23:08 you post you have to select why you're
23:11 posting and it's sort of this policing
23:14 mechanism to make sure that you don't
23:16 make a fool out of yourself but now what
23:19 do the people on the deep thoughts radio
23:22 Facebook page do that would make me a
23:24 compliment them when they disagree they
23:28 find the most beautiful way to
23:30 acknowledge in a very friendly voice
23:34 what the other person sitting saying I
23:37 heard you right that's the first thing
23:38 that's good and then very gently bring
23:43 in their personal experience in most
23:45 cases right and saying well you know
23:47 what I found is a little different than
23:50 yours now it may be a lot different than
23:52 yours but they're going to use words
23:53 like little just to ease you into seeing
23:55 their side of the game and then usually
23:58 with very articulate specific moments in
24:01 time they are starting to break down
24:03 what is their differ differing opinion
24:08 and what I have found is one of two
24:12 things with my own personal experience
24:14 reading their comments one is I will
24:19 change my opinion to their opinion
24:20 because they did such a beautiful job
24:23 but the second thing is actually a
24:25 little more interesting to in my opinion
24:27 we might find out that when your
24:31 piercing more ambiguous subject matter
24:35 like let's just say Q the Q and on a
24:37 phenomenon right no one can prove this
24:40 guy's real no one can prove this guy is
24:42 fake
24:43 you can't you can say oh there's proofs
24:45 here and there and it sure looks like it
24:46 but man you don't know the guy is
24:49 basically reading us the news these days
24:51 but as we tried to develop a unified
24:55 theory about something like him we have
24:58 to
24:59 propose our opinions and again if
25:02 somebody says exactly what we believe on
25:05 Facebook we typically like them like
25:07 that comment if we totally absolutely
25:09 verbatim love the way they think and the
25:12 way they said it we'll put a little
25:13 heart on there and go damn brother you
25:15 have the way I believe what you believe
25:19 but now what we need to kind of give and
25:22 take on things right we talk about
25:24 dreams what are dreams well you know
25:25 we're trying to parse that on this show
25:28 what reality Oh reenter we're in a
25:30 computer simulation is this really God
25:32 firmament dome or we just a
25:34 insignificant dot on an insignificant
25:36 dot and an infinite space on a
25:38 heliocentric ball maybe God doesn't even
25:41 exist those are tough subjects with
25:45 tremendous gradients perhaps even
25:47 ironically infinite gradients and in
25:49 beliefs but now let's let's run the
25:53 scenario let's run a case study on
25:56 what's being what we're talking about
25:57 here somebody posts an article social
26:02 media whatever effect even news channels
26:05 now have like comment sections down
26:07 below if you're willing to sign it for
26:08 their crap but this thing has got you
26:11 riled up you want to express your
26:13 opinion you have a definite opinion
26:15 which is where you're going in at high
26:17 velocity now you might be the first
26:20 person to post you post your opinion
26:22 about something your take on it I just
26:26 expressed my opinion of Cortes someone
26:29 else who thinks she's the [ __ ]
26:31 greatest thing since sliced bread comes
26:33 in after me they don't have the same
26:36 experience I have and so they have a
26:38 totally different opinion of her they
26:41 think she's hot or whatever right and so
26:44 they go in there and they reply and now
26:49 they're angry at me for taking in
26:51 opposition against one of their heroes
26:53 here we go we start because that's just
26:57 the first step there's always a reply
26:59 button right so I have a couple options
27:03 I can ignore that post I made never look
27:09 back found one or you get a notification
27:11 somebody replied to your post
27:13 you don't even read it just leave it you
27:16 left your mark whatever that's what I do
27:18 most the time but someone comes in and
27:21 goes after you I had this happen on a
27:25 friend's feed about three weeks ago it
27:29 was only situations where someone was
27:31 being a complete snowflake I couldn't I
27:32 couldn't I think it's immigration or
27:34 something like that just being very
27:36 unrealistic about how many people we can
27:38 absorb and the money that we have to do
27:40 things and that there's any crimes
27:42 related to anyone coming in from a legal
27:44 country you know from a country that
27:45 illegally and so when I reply I got that
27:48 option hmm do I go in is extra strong
27:51 like they did against me or maybe they
27:54 even replied nice and I want to go no no
27:57 no you were so wrong and because I'm so
27:59 articulate I can pound you into the dirt
28:02 ten ways to Sunday
28:04 better than you can pound me into the
28:06 dirt with your limited vocabulary that
28:09 happens sometimes right and you know you
28:11 can get addicted to that too right watch
28:14 this oh when you just absolutely [ __ ]
28:17 destroy them you may be wrong but you're
28:19 so good articulating everyone's going
28:22 man usually read that person the right
28:24 you know the right act or whatever mmm
28:26 that wouldn't be good at me right in the
28:30 past I have lived at large and that
28:33 sinful little loop for sure and it was
28:36 by seeing others after me replying like
28:41 that come back in a very gentle voice
28:44 hey man I totally understand your
28:47 passion there I used to think the same
28:49 thing I did this this and this to get to
28:52 your opinion and I lived in that opinion
28:55 for X number of days months years then
28:57 this other thing happened to me and it
29:00 completely contradicted the way that I
29:01 believed and so now I'm not so sure
29:07 or now I'm totally convinced it's
29:09 different so I'm reading that and it's
29:12 almost like they're giving me a sooth
29:13 sayers you know pattern of words again
29:18 languages spelling right casting a spell
29:21 and so this was coming on me like a
29:25 spell
29:27 and right off the bat you can tell from
29:29 the people's really sensible gentle
29:31 replies that they're a sweet person
29:34 they've got a lot of patience maybe they
29:36 had a horrible childhood and man they're
29:38 just [ __ ] casual as [ __ ]
29:40 maybe they've been great their whole
29:41 life because they had parents that were
29:43 that way regardless I'm envious trust me
29:46 so what is our motto on the show right
29:49 rebuilding society from the bottom up I
29:52 gotta say to everyone some offer for the
29:54 newcomers this is a big one in my
29:56 opinion this is a big area where we
30:00 could improve the way we communicate now
30:04 what if you were to say okay how do you
30:08 neutralize this problem from the very
30:11 GetGo before these discussions ever
30:12 happen online how do you neutralize it
30:14 well I think the very best way to say it
30:19 I may abuse the English language I think
30:22 the best way to say it is we get
30:25 everyone on the same page we got all of
30:28 our beliefs to be exactly the same and
30:29 then we're good no one's disagreeing
30:32 with each other but now everybody's
30:34 laughing and everyone's grimacing at the
30:37 notion of what kind of world would make
30:39 that happen right there's gonna be some
30:42 goddamn Inquisition where everyone's
30:44 like you better believe tell us you
30:45 don't believe we're gonna kill your kid
30:47 we're gonna chop your feet off oh I
30:49 totally believe what do I believe again
30:51 oh that is it that is the truth oh my
30:53 god oh geez give me the [ __ ] out of here
30:54 right but now think about it we will not
30:58 have a super minor e hopefully that will
31:01 reset all of our minds right some matrix
31:04 situation where they stuff this wire in
31:05 the back of all of our brains and all of
31:07 a sudden we're like oh I love Cortez
31:11 that probably won't happen what's the
31:14 next logical thing we could really do
31:17 well obviously communicate with each
31:20 other the the whole reason for making
31:24 this episode is that obviously this
31:27 pattern of I'm right and you're wrong it
31:31 is a no-go non-starter method of
31:35 communicating because it's not only one
31:40 one who engages in this not only needs
31:42 to be right but they need the other
31:44 person to be wrong Steve Jobs said a
31:48 beautiful thing one time when he came
31:51 back in 1996 I believe the meeting was
31:53 in 97 he got on stage and he told all
31:55 these Apple people who were furious that
31:58 Microsoft Windows had copied the Mac OS
32:00 without paying them any money again
32:03 Apple paid Xerox PARC 110 million
32:07 dollars in stock options to be able to
32:09 to use this GUI interface it wasn't a
32:12 freebie steal that's one of the biggest
32:14 [ __ ] myths about Apple but he says we
32:18 are going to do business with Microsoft
32:21 because the Microsoft Office suite is
32:23 absolutely critical for any operating
32:25 system in the world you have to have it
32:27 and err ones like boo right and so then
32:31 he goes and he brings Bill Gates up on
32:34 the screen in a simulcast and of course
32:38 Bill knew what could happen so you
32:41 actually played it pretty cool where
32:43 does that guy is but he said look
32:44 they're also investing 150 million
32:46 dollars into Apple as good faith to help
32:49 the R&D process and everybody boot again
32:53 fact they boot so damn loud that Bill
32:57 Gates couldn't hear Steve and so they
32:59 were kind of like stuck for a few
33:01 minutes but Steve being the consummate
33:03 genius that he was he thought this whole
33:07 thing through before he said a word he
33:10 said look folks Microsoft doesn't have
33:14 to lose for Apple to win and I have to
33:19 say I was sitting there I think I was
33:21 watching this live wherever the hell I
33:23 was and I was right there with the
33:28 audience just sort of the ignorant mob
33:31 boo right I had been programming on
33:35 Microsoft Windows since 1987 with
33:39 Windows 2.0 getting the Macintosh
33:41 product out there called tax view I've
33:43 been supporting the product trying to
33:45 get a goddamn printer to work plug and
33:47 play never was plug and play it's a
33:49 windows 7 pro right it sounds all Angry
33:53 but I heard Steve say those words and in
33:57 my lifetime okay in my entire lifetime
34:00 if I were to pick some of the most
34:03 profound phrases that changed my
34:05 attitude and my paradigm of thinking I'm
34:07 sure there's others but right now that
34:11 little phrase he said which I love he's
34:12 an adventure of it but was the most
34:15 ingenious thing to say because it turned
34:17 my heart immediately and I was like
34:18 you're right
34:19 you're right because there's that old
34:21 thing about you know if you can't beat
34:22 them join them
34:23 hmm but we didn't have to join them we
34:27 didn't have to beat him either we were
34:29 our own thing the Apple platform and
34:32 believe me in 97 you were an Apple fan
34:34 you had scars all over your body this
34:38 need to be right is a very fascinating
34:40 thing now
34:43 I'm gonna dive into cuz you know it's
34:45 hard to lament about this forever
34:47 but I want to show some more examples of
34:49 where I think that the community of deep
34:52 thoughts radio has done a brilliant job
34:54 now when you comment in the comments
34:58 section of a YouTube video it's usually
35:00 fairly standalone folks there's some
35:02 folks that know each other and so they
35:03 start to kind of high-five each other
35:04 which is super [ __ ] cool man let me
35:06 tell you but when you get into the
35:08 Facebook group you start to learn each
35:09 other's names and what I find absolutely
35:12 endearing is that I know I've invited a
35:15 bunch of my personal friends from Los
35:17 Angeles into this movement I guess you
35:20 can call it that and Channel and then I
35:23 see a lot of the random folks that have
35:24 come in from all around the world and I
35:27 figure out when I friend them because
35:30 I'll friend you guys through my deep
35:31 mine account and any of you want to be
35:33 my friend I'll deep mine just click it
35:35 and I'll let you write in but I'll
35:38 notice that you're friends with my
35:39 friends and I think that's awesome
35:41 they're not mine but you know I'm saying
35:43 like you guys have met each other and
35:44 you respect each other and even some
35:47 folks that used to post on the channel a
35:49 bunch don't post that much anymore but
35:51 they still post on Facebook and they're
35:53 all my buddies chatting back and forth
35:55 that is awesome right and it's probably
36:00 because they found commonalities not not
36:02 things that they disagree on the flatter
36:05 thing for some people
36:07 is gigantic by the way I just saw this
36:10 episode on it's called beyond the curve
36:13 on Netflix I think some of you guys have
36:14 been trying to link to that I don't
36:15 think anyone likes it I haven't seen it
36:17 yet but for some people this is huge if
36:21 it were flat then the Bible the
36:24 Christian Bible with a lot of other
36:26 excuse me
36:27 Jewish Bibles Muslim Bibles or Islamic
36:29 Bibles or whatever the Quran there's
36:31 always some reference of four corners of
36:33 the earth and a flat disk space with the
36:36 dome you know I mean there's all kinds
36:38 of references to it and so people feel
36:41 very locked into that that to deny it is
36:45 to deny God it's to give the secular
36:47 science flying quotes folks an
36:51 opportunity to destroy our belief system
36:53 and our Creator now I don't really
36:56 believe that in terms of I have never
36:58 considered until what was it 2016 I'm
37:03 not quite sure that this was flat I mean
37:05 I never even had that I grew up in
37:08 Kansas with the Kansas record albums I
37:11 was showing a boat going off the edge of
37:13 the the world which obviously is not the
37:16 model but I mean if someone told me and
37:19 could prove to me that the world is a
37:20 tetrahedron or we are inside of the
37:22 matrix because they pull up the floor
37:24 and there's a you know some code down
37:26 there and underneath my carpet it
37:29 wouldn't disturb in this slide is my
37:31 belief in a god but what I think is
37:33 interesting about this whole thing is
37:35 there's going to be those acidic
37:37 subjects where people are gonna come
37:39 marching in the course of no one sees
37:41 this episode which could be the majority
37:42 of the world then we're going to
37:44 continue this sad sad chapter in man's
37:49 social development I think if this
37:52 little meme went around this thing I
37:53 created if it was starting to be posted
37:55 in different posts I'm gonna make it
37:58 here's what we'll do well have some fun
38:00 with this I wanted to make a version of
38:05 the graphic where each one of the
38:06 options was selected and then you can
38:09 download that to your computer and
38:11 anywhere in the world where you think
38:13 someone is posting for one of these
38:14 reasons in a foolish way you just reply
38:16 with the graphic with that particular
38:18 reason selected essentially saying
38:20 you're
38:21 you signaling right that's that's one of
38:22 the I don't think it's in my list but
38:24 you know somebody loves me boom but just
38:29 raising the awareness their practice is
38:32 huge we get the cream of the crop in the
38:35 Facebook page for this show because all
38:37 of you guys are doing great with each
38:39 other and we've had some people come in
38:40 and be really honored like I've said in
38:42 previous episodes I can't remember what
38:44 it was one kid came in he was he was he
38:48 kind of tell he was a little younger and
38:49 I think English was the second language
38:50 but he was doing pretty good I don't
38:52 think I've seen this kid in a really
38:53 long time but he came in just
38:55 guns-a-blazing
38:56 and and our guys were super nice too to
39:01 this person I mean guys and gals right
39:02 and eventually just came in and you know
39:05 left I left his comments up there and I
39:07 just said you know I think you can find
39:10 a better way of you know communicating
39:12 your thing and then the guy apologized
39:13 and it was beautiful the kid learned and
39:16 maybe went away just to kind of lick his
39:18 wounds a little bit so that next time he
39:20 comes back his post or a million miles
39:22 down no one remembers right but honestly
39:25 I can't remember this kid's name was but
39:27 for me he gets a star for the day more
39:31 so than I do because he grew when that
39:34 was great you know my episode how many
39:39 wars will be out before this episode and
39:41 it's actually sort of the the bedrock of
39:47 this problem you know as I said in the
39:49 episode the episode is really about if
39:51 you haven't seen it is all about them
39:54 trying to divide us against each other
39:57 conquer and divine and as long as
40:00 they're fighting among each other then
40:02 we don't fight against them the cause of
40:04 the problem remember when that movement
40:06 came out in the world it was random acts
40:09 of kindness and it was cool because it
40:12 came out at a time
40:13 I'm sure its surface many times in
40:15 history but it surfaced again during the
40:18 Internet explosion when we had YouTube
40:22 to track what happened I don't think
40:24 Facebook was a big deal yet and people
40:27 were doing all kinds of wonderful things
40:28 for people going up and giving people
40:32 what they needed it happens all the time
40:34 in the world
40:34 people who donate food and toys and
40:36 Christmas and all that good stuff taking
40:38 care of homeless people and all that
40:39 stuff I think one of the famous ones was
40:41 a little boy was giving out sandwiches
40:42 to homeless people and I think they the
40:45 cops tried to arrest the kid and the
40:46 family obviously there are homeless
40:48 people that are perfectly healthy and
40:51 they're just lazy and they don't want to
40:53 work but there's a lot of homeless
40:55 people that would take any job you give
40:57 them and they're the most gracious sweet
41:00 people on planet earth they just had a
41:01 bunch of crap happened to them you know
41:04 sometimes it affects their mind and so
41:06 they don't think straight it's a very
41:08 tough thing to do but that was a sort of
41:12 mechanism by which people converted from
41:14 looking at homeless people and calling
41:16 them bums and you know like you're
41:18 always gonna take all the money I give
41:19 you and go buy booze that was the thing
41:21 when I was a kid but there wasn't a lot
41:24 of homelessness when I was a kid when I
41:26 first moved to Los Angeles in 87 I'm
41:28 telling you I have no memories of any
41:31 homeless people anywhere and I'm sure
41:32 they were here but boy it was it was
41:35 kind of a needle in the haystack but now
41:38 they're everywhere every town they've
41:42 been busted where people you know live
41:44 in nice homes they actually have jobs or
41:46 whatever some of them make six figures
41:48 and it's tax-free they they go off to
41:51 their really nice car drive to a home
41:55 you're going to beg for 12 hours a day
41:57 in the rain and cold all year long when
42:00 I go to the Facebook pages of people who
42:05 live in the big city I will definitely
42:08 see this but it's a little bit less and
42:10 but in the lesser category of city folk
42:16 it's more acidic the wounds are deeper
42:20 the knife cuts all the flesh down to the
42:23 bone people going for it when I see it
42:26 in my little hometown and the
42:27 communities in the Midwest because
42:29 everyone has their friendship circles I
42:31 see this sort of innocent naivete about
42:36 how the world works because I know
42:38 coming from a small town in Kansas they
42:41 have no grasp of reality they have grasp
42:44 of a really good reality where they live
42:47 but they don't have experience with
42:50 friends and family that have lost
42:52 someone due to a murder caused by an
42:56 illegal immigrant you know when I first
43:00 moved to Huntington Beach you know I was
43:02 told hey this is one of the safest towns
43:03 in all of California one of the
43:06 neighboring towns is called fountain
43:08 vallye fountain valley is tucked
43:10 literally inside of the city limits of
43:13 Huntington Beach and is bordered by
43:15 place called Costa Mesa so it's super
43:18 safe as well saying saying police force
43:20 quality same helicopters same everything
43:22 right but a close family friend of mine
43:28 a woman in her I believe in her late 50s
43:33 lives alone in a townhouse she's lived
43:36 in for a really long time has a little
43:38 little wiener dogs and she woke up one
43:42 morning walked out her door and uh heard
43:45 or her apartment has like a staircase
43:47 that goes against the wall up to her
43:49 master bedroom yeah so she has like a
43:51 big vaulted ceiling in the main room and
43:53 she looked down and there was an illegal
43:54 immigrant male sitting in her sofa
43:57 watching television he had been eating
43:59 all of her food and this is woman all by
44:02 herself no weapon unfortunately the dog
44:06 starts going nuts
44:07 the guy actually was fairly cool because
44:10 he could have gone upstairs and done
44:12 something horrible to this woman he had
44:15 found her keys to her car set this whole
44:18 thing up he very quietly without saying
44:22 a work is on a nope he speaks English or
44:23 not grabs her keys walks through the
44:26 kitchen walks into the garage pops the
44:29 door opens her car door gets in and
44:31 leaves with her car 12 hours later the
44:34 car chase was over he totals her car
44:36 come to find out he had crawled through
44:39 one of those dinky little bathroom
44:40 windows and spent the whole night eating
44:44 their food I don't think that's ever
44:46 happened in my hometown once so now I
44:50 had this personal experience being in a
44:52 place that I believe is very very safe I
44:54 did catch the guy luckily the guy wasn't
44:58 some crazy murderers
44:59 let's thank our lucky stars at least he
45:02 had that moral fiber but this woman was
45:05 not safe in her own home I mean a
45:10 bathroom window come on those windows
45:12 start about five feet in the air he
45:15 still got in hmm so now if that woman
45:21 knew people in my hometown there's only
45:24 a couple that will be like oh we need to
45:26 lead all the illegal illegal aliens in
45:28 I'm a super Democrat I'm virtue
45:29 signaling like crazy which is this
45:31 argument half of this woman recently and
45:34 she saw that she'd be like excuse me she
45:38 has a choice right she can get totally
45:40 acidic and she'll actually be right and
45:43 the other woman will be wrong she could
45:46 go that route and say look you have no
45:48 idea what the hell you're talking about
45:49 this happened to me pop-up guy my living
45:52 room stole my car totaled my car now I
45:54 got to go follow the file this police
45:56 report crap go buy a new car deal with
45:59 the insurance he'll Jesus who knows if
46:01 the insurance will go up well regardless
46:03 what if she had something very important
46:05 she had to do that day what if her
46:06 daughter was getting married that day
46:08 and all of a sudden she's got this
46:10 traumatic [ __ ] thing and imagine your
46:13 woman living by yourself and your late
46:15 50s what do you do to feel secure
46:18 anymore do you realize that you chock it
46:22 up to this is a one-in-a-million
46:23 situation it'll never happen again
46:25 you're due you're not due for that till
46:27 another lifetime comes around mm-hmm I
46:29 think we'd love to feel that way but we
46:31 don't feel that way we feel nervous as
46:33 [ __ ] well this can happen once maybe
46:36 what happens again maybe she goes off
46:37 now she's gonna buy a $500 pistol yeah
46:41 she's got this gun in the house you know
46:42 she has grandkids he's got to worry
46:44 about hiding the thing I mean it just
46:45 turns into an absolute mess but if we
46:49 had a border we could keep everybody out
46:51 and then turn up legal immigration got
46:54 people good citizens coming in we know
46:55 exactly who they are they have great
46:57 jobs they got their own car has their
46:58 own houses no need to break in anyone
47:00 else's stuff then it goes down so that's
47:04 sort of the flip side of someone being
47:06 angry at someone else for a very
47:08 legitimate reason so we have a tall
47:11 order don't we
47:12 when you're looking at someone champing
47:15 climate change which is going to create
47:17 draconian carbon taxation based on the
47:20 most incredible tonnage of lies about
47:25 how the world's weather is changing due
47:26 to mankind were misleading everything
47:31 right I was recently talking to a friend
47:33 of mine tonight about the the moon hoax
47:35 stuff and it dawned on me that she was
47:41 talking about getting into the debate of
47:43 the Van Allen belts and I said well the
47:46 problem with trying to debate anyone in
47:48 the official science realm about the Van
47:50 Allen belts is that they've completely
47:52 lied about what's at the core of the
47:53 center of the earth I'm just going to
47:55 digress for a fun little second year
47:57 they've told us it's nickel alloy in the
48:00 center of the earth well people have
48:02 done the math done some chemistry and
48:04 said wait a minute when nickel heats up
48:06 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit it loses all of
48:09 its magnetic properties and so you
48:11 couldn't be creating the Van Allen belts
48:13 with that particular core to a planet
48:15 well anyone try to predict what's a
48:17 nervous the center of our planet I don't
48:18 know but if you go read about the Sun
48:22 they'll tell you it's a plasma core ok
48:26 so we know that that thing is a giant
48:29 pole coming out of it we do we can
48:31 measure it alright so you tell me that
48:34 moons and planets have completely
48:37 different cores than the Sun but they're
48:39 all creating the same pole around the
48:41 entire body it's the same thing because
48:44 I always tell you on this show it's all
48:45 plasma course it's just the way it works
48:48 so I mentioned that for one specific
48:51 reason we might see the failure and
48:55 logic of this whole thing but you can't
48:58 have two things do the exact same thing
48:59 and then they're completely made out of
49:01 different things when they exist in the
49:03 same space literally doing the same
49:07 thing you shouldn't create two laws of
49:09 physics because you won you bullshitted
49:11 about what was at the interior of this
49:12 of the planet Earth first got your lie
49:15 in it was your best guest at the time
49:17 yeah that's fine no no hard feelings but
49:20 then later after you thought things
49:22 through when you falsifies about what
49:24 was in the center and this
49:25 the Sun you got it right at least
49:27 partially right but you didn't go back
49:30 and revise the other theories because
49:32 that means someone got something wrong
49:33 boy academics never want to be wrong do
49:35 they is the moral the story to be nice
49:38 to each other
49:39 mm-hmm god forbid that would be the the
49:42 idea of it all I think one of the
49:44 coolest things I've learned and probably
49:46 last 10-15 years I have no idea who said
49:51 it first to me or if I heard two other
49:53 people talking about it and I simply
49:55 overheard I don't remember but someone
49:58 was doing something cantankerous around
50:01 me right sort of ornery and unnecessary
50:05 and this other person said well we don't
50:09 know what kind of day they've had May
50:12 that maybe they've had the worst day on
50:14 planet Earth
50:15 for them or their perspective of the
50:18 world maybe it wouldn't bother us if we
50:20 have the exact same day or maybe we'd be
50:22 crushed to like little pieces if we had
50:25 their name but they're still functional
50:26 so really they're kind of heroes for
50:28 still participating in society in that
50:31 particular day but let's say they cut us
50:34 off in the car even they're not even
50:36 trying to but they're so preoccupied
50:37 with their horrible day they're not
50:39 paying attention maybe they say
50:42 something online it's way more acidic
50:44 than they should or they're posting crap
50:46 that's just nuts whatever it is their
50:49 communication interaction with society
50:50 is less than the best let's just put
50:54 that way but whoever said this to me in
50:57 front of me whatever taught me a huge
51:01 lesson that was gonna take me years I'm
51:04 still learning how to really respond
51:06 with this sensibility inside me which is
51:09 maybe I should take a deep breath count
51:12 to 10 thank this thing through and see
51:16 if I can't just let it go pass me see if
51:20 I can't be a very gentle person if I
51:23 really need to interact with this person
51:25 you know and again obviously bad ideas
51:31 spread online all the time through posts
51:34 and comments and all that kind of stuff
51:35 bad ideas too I guess the
51:38 of us who think the wrong part of it
51:40 might be just let it go you know with
51:46 Facebook it's very interesting you sort
51:50 of have a small click with your Facebook
51:52 folks right and but I think that most of
51:55 us reply on Facebook today and sort of I
51:59 think a somewhat guarded fashion in most
52:01 cases depending on how secure your life
52:03 is how secure is your employment right
52:05 you want to be saying a bunch of super
52:07 controversial stuff in your feed in your
52:09 post on Facebook if on a routine basis
52:13 you're looking for jobs and people might
52:14 want to figure out who you are then go
52:17 up to your Facebook take a look at like
52:18 oh my god this dude's nuts or mean or
52:21 whatever there's another social media
52:26 site that's called LinkedIn which is
52:28 dedicated to networking with business
52:30 people and it utterly baffles me when
52:34 people take positions that are very
52:36 controversial on those sites because
52:38 it's telling fellow employers and
52:40 associates and basically you're building
52:42 your reputation as a human being and a
52:45 very exposed way on that site and I
52:49 absolutely do not do any of that stuff
52:51 on there luckily there's not a
52:54 tremendous amount of conspiracy out
52:55 there but you will see like a climate
52:56 change post you know oh my god here we
52:58 go but I don't reply I don't want that
53:02 out there right you know they always say
53:05 when you go to dinner
53:06 especially those Holly holiday dinners
53:09 you never supposed to talk about two
53:10 things right religion and politics cuz
53:13 it's only gonna go bad in front of
53:14 everybody else right well they're right
53:17 it's a cliche but goddamn it they're a
53:19 thousand percent correct and LinkedIn is
53:22 your Thanksgiving dinner keep that [ __ ]
53:25 to yourself as my opinion my advice
53:29 Facebook well lock it down make sure
53:31 that you have your own little circle and
53:33 then just go sit there with people
53:36 hopefully like our Facebook people who
53:39 are well educated very articulate and
53:43 even if they didn't have a big giant
53:45 career in some you know form of science
53:47 or whatever we're talking about they do
53:50 a damn good job
53:52 and if someone comes in dead empty but
53:55 they're super duper interested they'll
53:56 let you know look guys I don't have any
53:58 knowledge in this but I would love to
53:59 know please dump your opinions right
54:01 here and they soon find out there's a
54:03 lot of different opinions about things
54:05 right so in closing let's just look at
54:09 one very interesting benefit of this
54:13 whole thing with social media and this
54:15 might be I don't even sure I put this in
54:17 my facebook episode because it happens
54:20 everywhere it happens everywhere social
54:22 media exists right for the very first
54:24 time man is probably organically
54:29 dividing into consensuses you're
54:32 Christians will find each other
54:34 you're Muslims will find each other
54:36 you're flattering each other you're
54:38 around earth people find each other
54:39 people think we went to the moon find
54:40 each other
54:41 hoax people find each other and we're
54:44 all engaging in our discussions to try
54:47 and validate what we think might be true
54:49 you know I have gone after the moon
54:52 missions several times and I am not
54:54 finished right but I will let you know
54:57 that I have I have always been sort of I
55:02 don't know I have a secret little part
55:06 of me a little molecule of me that goes
55:09 damn it can't I just find something that
55:11 makes me believe it that makes all this
55:14 this horrible footage in bad science and
55:18 all this unexplained crap and all the
55:20 earth rocks that are found you know
55:21 taken from the moon and flip my opinion
55:25 and to my dismay every time I go into it
55:30 I find more evidence against it I find
55:34 more experts more smoking guns and some
55:37 of the smoking guns are so minuscule yet
55:42 smoking guns that I don't even mention
55:44 it
55:45 because it's too it's too much in the
55:49 minutiae of life people aren't gonna
55:53 research it that much I used to be
55:56 really hot on this truth movement again
56:00 I've said this a couple times back in
56:01 2005 I wanted to tell the world
56:05 and I was hot on I built a website I
56:08 built I wrote literally a hundred blog
56:11 posts on this thing and then I did the
56:14 MK ULTRA radio with my buddy Kyle and
56:16 then what happened was that the snowball
56:19 kept rolling downhill and there's
56:21 obviously tens of thousands of other
56:23 people doing exactly the same thing
56:25 probably way better than anything I've
56:26 ever done
56:27 and so we started this Great Awakening
56:31 them the woke people and then this is
56:36 sort of how this show started
56:37 was that I felt like okay that's going
56:41 that's its own thing and it's it's going
56:43 to continue going and now we have
56:44 extremely dedicated people who have
56:47 seemingly no job they can just make
56:49 videos all day long and some of them
56:51 manage to get millions of followers and
56:53 probably live off their ad revenue you
56:55 know good for them but we are
56:58 communicating we are growing
57:00 this problem of being bright and to
57:03 someone else being wrong and someone
57:05 getting a big hoorah out of that it's
57:07 gonna continue again there's a way of
57:10 discussing it so that you don't fall
57:11 into the formula of this show like I
57:14 opened with people who are very gentle
57:16 and talking about these kind of things I
57:18 think that for me I will infinitely
57:21 aspire to be that kind of person
57:23 whether I crossed some line in the sand
57:26 that I don't know where it is but I
57:28 crossed it and then suddenly I never
57:30 ever ever commit this sin on society I
57:34 hope that happens I'm not gonna hold my
57:37 breath right but I'm gonna try every
57:39 time I get in there and again this is
57:41 one of those examples by me making the
57:43 episode it will be on my mind
57:47 more so than if I hadn't made the
57:49 episode now I'm gonna give you one more
57:52 example of maybe how to think about this
57:55 to get it right but before I say this we
57:59 know that the the immature the neophytes
58:03 to the internet into social media are
58:05 going to have to boil off right and
58:08 usually they're older people who have
58:11 just made their first facebook account
58:12 they're 45 or over and then of course
58:15 they're like I'm gonna tease the world
58:17 all
58:17 stuff right yeah they're gonna come and
58:20 go constantly and then of course is the
58:23 fake news side of it which knows exactly
58:25 what they're doing all right people who
58:26 pump climate change understand the game
58:29 they're playing and then of course
58:30 there's the people that trust them
58:32 unfortunately and repeat the lie
58:34 hopefully we all wake up but now let me
58:38 give you an analogy of maybe how to deal
58:39 with this if you feel like you've got a
58:41 really good grasp of the universe and
58:43 all of its infinitesimal measurements
58:48 matrix that you can major humanity's
58:51 behavior on let's say just for giggles
58:57 you are an alien from another world but
59:01 you just happen to look human so you
59:03 pass from all the other people right and
59:05 you're from a race that is essentially
59:09 the the engineers of society and you've
59:13 always been here and you live and die
59:16 just like everybody else because you're
59:17 made of the same thing but you come to
59:19 earth with a privileged knowledge that
59:23 your people are here and there's other
59:25 people who are here for other reasons
59:27 and they're strengthening other things
59:28 perhaps they're the people that drop
59:29 science on everybody but you're here as
59:33 an ultimate engineer of mental exchange
59:38 between two people or more and so you
59:43 sort of have all this methodology
59:46 figured out you know that if you go in
59:49 really strong as a I'm right and you're
59:51 wrong no one's gonna listen to you but
59:53 your job as this alien is to be heard is
59:58 to be understood and so now let's just
60:01 say your brains highly functional
60:03 whereas most human beings have maybe
60:06 1500 words in their vocabulary
60:07 you've got 25,000 words in your
60:09 vocabulary and you're a master at using
60:12 it right they're using them and so
60:15 you're able to go online your first day
60:19 here let's say you're 30 years old so
60:22 you just got a lot of training 10 years
60:23 of training under your belt maybe you've
60:27 had your brain program by some matrix
60:28 injection
60:30 to be even smarter than the average bear
60:33 you're a super alien that can take on
60:35 things much deeper much quicker and you
60:39 go on to your first Facebook account and
60:44 now you're looking at everybody's
60:45 comments and instead of ever being
60:48 infuriated you're essentially trying to
60:52 gauge how much you're laughing inside
60:55 and some of the funny little archetypes
60:58 of communication that we have as human
61:00 beings and so then it's a cakewalk right
61:04 it's a cakewalk you can reply to
61:06 anything and you just take as an example
61:09 the things that you believe which may or
61:12 may not be true because you're not
61:13 really an alien and you communicate them
61:16 very quietly softly and them they can
61:20 get totally irate with you but you know
61:23 whatever it is you know that's you going
61:26 with a bit of rapport with these people
61:31 you gain their respect slowly by always
61:33 being tender to them maybe you realize
61:36 that they've reached a breaking point
61:37 and you throw in a line that just simply
61:41 says well you know what maybe you're
61:42 right I appreciate your opinion and you
61:46 leave the thread go on to another person
61:49 one of the most classic things that kids
61:51 do with parents and I always have to
61:54 remind parents of this because we get
61:55 stuck in our little microcosms of being
61:57 parents is that you'll you'll have a kid
62:01 who's doing something stupid and you
62:03 know it's stupid because you did it when
62:05 you were a kid maybe you didn't do it to
62:07 the degree they're doing it and so your
62:08 extra afraid because they're going balls
62:10 out right a lot of people smoke weed
62:12 back in the 70s and 80s and it was brown
62:15 Mexican weed as they always said it was
62:17 much softer on the system you didn't get
62:21 so high so quickly wasn't the chronic
62:23 and now you got kids but legalized
62:26 marijuana and man they're smoking bags
62:27 of the [ __ ] three days will be through
62:30 half an ounce right whatever the
62:32 violation might be isn't it to be weed
62:34 but you know they're making poor
62:36 decisions now maybe you're lucky and
62:39 you're a parent that's done the same
62:41 thing and you've messed up your life one
62:43 point and your child
62:43 aware of that mess up don't so you can
62:46 sit him down and say look you remember
62:48 that part of my life I told you about
62:49 where it all went wrong right well this
62:52 thing you're doing right now is a
62:53 fracture is like two times as intense is
62:56 the thing I was doing so you better be
62:58 careful but you'll get into some advice
63:01 advice session with your child and your
63:04 child will start just denying you nope
63:08 you're wrong you're wrong you're stupid
63:10 saying things horrible that's the way
63:13 Society tells us to raise our kids right
63:15 but here's the thing your kids are
63:19 hearing you but they just don't want to
63:21 in your face acknowledge that they're
63:24 hearing you they want to win because
63:27 it's a matter of right of passage right
63:29 they want to prove to you they can take
63:32 care of themselves but more importantly
63:33 they want to prove to themselves so they
63:35 want to take care of that they can take
63:36 care of themselves and so they're
63:38 denying you they're just being ornery
63:40 very quietly after you're gone they
63:45 heard you they start looking at cause
63:48 and effect models because they don't
63:49 want to really fail and because you have
63:52 raised them and generally they do trust
63:54 you because of the bond you have
63:55 biologically or even just through a
63:58 devoted parental you know custodian of
64:03 their life they do trust you and
64:05 sometimes the kids will start doing
64:08 exactly what you said but they'll hide
64:11 it from you because they don't want you
64:13 to know that you're right it's a rite of
64:16 passage there may be an element of that
64:20 that factors into adults who are still
64:22 trying to prove to the world that they
64:24 are smart I have relatives that have
64:30 this phobia being wrong and so they will
64:33 fight anything I say no matter what I
64:36 say it's just a and they're [ __ ] old
64:39 right they're way older than me
64:41 but they just can't let it go mmm it's a
64:46 sad thing I hope that they get through
64:48 this childhood phase before they die but
64:51 I actually think that most of them won't
64:53 and so at that point it's just like
64:56 reaching the point
64:57 no return with someone in a conversation
64:59 you just let it go
65:01 you just say well that's not the person
65:03 I'm gonna try to influence because
65:06 they're sort of they've well one they've
65:08 heard your point already they've heard
65:10 your counter-argument so if they were
65:12 ever going to use your data in their
65:14 life you would see it already or you see
65:16 the lease hopefully in the near future
65:19 the other one I want to mention just
65:21 before I close here is the phenomenon
65:25 where people have been stuck in a circle
65:28 in their life but they didn't feel like
65:30 they had any control and so when they
65:34 start getting control they start feeling
65:36 elation and you know I had a relative of
65:41 mine who went to college got a degree
65:44 got a job exactly in that degree and was
65:46 actually fairly great at that job very
65:48 celebrated by their clients but then
65:51 they got married and I had to take care
65:54 of some siblings in the married family
65:57 you know the other guy had some kids and
66:00 then she had her own kid
66:01 and she did a great job she managed to
66:04 take a pretty chaotic situation and make
66:06 it very peaceful and everyone fell in
66:08 love with each other eventually it was
66:09 sort of a rough road at first but
66:11 eventually turned out to be great
66:13 but then she went back to college and
66:16 she got a degree in art and then I was
66:21 at a an event and she walked around the
66:24 event and told everyone that she got
66:27 this degree and we were all just super
66:29 surprised and excited and and the the
66:36 weird thing that she said over and over
66:38 and over was see I'm smart see I wasn't
66:46 dumb after all something to that effect
66:49 and I remember looking at that situation
66:52 and kind of going wow I never ever
66:56 postulated in my life that this person
66:58 wasn't smart or intelligent or whatever
67:01 and then when I looked at her artwork I
67:03 was utterly blown away by how amazing
67:05 the artwork was I was like Jesus art
67:07 runs
67:08 my family let me tell you man but there
67:11 was this psychosis this worry about
67:14 being wrong about being dumb or whatever
67:16 and so this person is extremely tender
67:19 and never ever would engage in the
67:21 things that we're talking about at least
67:23 in social media for sure she'd be more
67:25 to be quiet if someone disagreed with
67:26 their sort of thing but it sort of broke
67:29 my heart that this person had carried
67:31 this feeling about themselves for a
67:33 really long time now imagine the person
67:36 that's a little more forceful popping
67:38 out of this phase in their life and
67:40 their mid-50s or whatever or even older
67:43 and suddenly getting this feeling of
67:45 control but they lacked that social
67:49 interaction experience because perhaps
67:51 they've been in their own household for
67:53 a really long time or their little
67:54 circle of life maybe they moved out of a
67:57 little town to a bigger town maybe they
67:59 didn't start communicating with people
68:01 from bigger towns it can be very
68:03 disorienting and so I think that my
68:06 point is in this last comment was there
68:09 are immature people out there I'm one of
68:12 them and when you see us say stupid
68:15 things
68:16 you can turn on your intellectual
68:18 superiority and that's what it is and
68:21 you could be gentle and help us
68:23 understand how to be more like you
68:26 anyhow I think you feel me I think this
68:29 is an important thing to recognize and
68:32 sort of educate each other on if you
68:36 have a minute deep thoughts radio Calm
68:37 please go there's audio and video in
68:39 case you want to switch feeds there's a
68:41 locked Facebook group as I've mentioned
68:43 several times on this episode there's
68:45 now a new Twitter page and a patreon
68:47 page for anyone who wants to contribute
68:49 for those of you who contribute to the
68:50 patreon page I really appreciate it
68:52 takes care of the cigars for sure kind
68:55 of gives me a little bit of a paycheck
68:56 for all this work which is pretty cool
68:59 anyway take care of yourself and someone
69:02 else that I'll see in the next deep
69:03 thoughts over now
