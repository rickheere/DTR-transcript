00:00 [Music]
00:31 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:34 deep thoughts
00:34 another night edition it's about 1:00 in
00:37 the morning
00:38 seems like a good time to record so
00:42 today's episode is gonna be about
00:43 emotional intelligence which is also
00:46 referred to as EQ or emotional quotient
00:51 like IQ intelligent intelligence
00:55 quotient quotient cogent hate that word
01:01 emotional IQ is something really big in
01:05 this world because there are potentially
01:11 older generations that have an immense
01:14 abundance of this and we have a younger
01:18 generation that is struggling to have
01:20 any of it the way I would like to frame
01:25 this in your mind as you listen to this
01:26 episode is this is an extremely critical
01:28 subject to think about discuss probably
01:33 them first with yourself and then with
01:34 any like minds because especially if
01:37 you're a parent this is so massive
01:41 because it's one of these things where
01:45 if you look up you know II I or EQ and
01:49 you start looking at the level of
01:51 research that went into it it was
01:55 pioneered in a book a 1964 got a man doc
02:00 did it and that was reprise and reprise
02:03 and reprised and when the ruling class
02:07 hears something about this
02:09 they are extremely aware of this because
02:11 they live with this sort of thing in
02:13 their mind constantly what makes them
02:15 superior to everyone else I mean you can
02:19 debate their superiority now of course
02:21 the siblings of those that are actually
02:22 pioneered the financial institutions the
02:26 governmental institutions they can have
02:29 offspring that never learned this and
02:31 they live in a trust-fund world or they
02:34 hold more celebratory roles within
02:36 banking they don't really do anything
02:38 but they kind of go in and
02:40 act smart because someone ahead of them
02:41 in their family tree knocked it out of
02:44 the park
02:46 but I assure you they put money aside to
02:49 figure these things out and when they
02:52 decide oh those are the kind of people
02:55 that are in the profiles that can do us
02:59 harm that have traditionally done his
03:01 harm they thought for themselves and
03:03 they had self-awareness they were able
03:06 to be self-motivated they didn't need
03:10 anyone telling them what to do to go out
03:12 and do something amazing what do you
03:15 think the truth comes from when it's
03:17 been hidden well there's two ways you
03:19 can find the truth the 1% of the game is
03:22 you say or dip Italy fall on the truth
03:24 and you go oh my god there's the truth
03:26 that almost never happens
03:29 99% of the time someone starts becoming
03:32 extremely aware extremely enlightened
03:34 and starts smelling something in the
03:36 room and goes wait a minute something's
03:39 wrong here this this big terrorist
03:43 attack is not the way it couldn't have
03:46 happened the way they said it could
03:47 couldn't happen in the way they said it
03:49 could in science it can't have happened
03:51 in terms of individuals that have been
03:53 accused of being you know a part of
03:55 something so you need to understand that
03:57 AI q is something huge that we need to
04:02 make sure that we protect our children
04:04 so that they may have some and this
04:08 could be protecting them from bad public
04:11 schools making sure your kid doesn't go
04:13 to a shitty college where teachers and
04:15 professors you know who have escaped the
04:18 reality escaped real life god bless a
04:21 lot of teachers PE teachers are just you
04:24 know great people that know the kids
04:26 need to learn things some of them more
04:28 in the university side of things than
04:30 anything they stay inside the university
04:32 because they got a crappy degree the
04:33 only option they have is to teach it but
04:37 they don't really want to be there and
04:38 so they become disenfranchised and as
04:40 they become unhappy they take on
04:41 doctrine of disenfranchised harvesting
04:44 political parties that do nothing but
04:47 incubate hate and intolerance and then
04:49 of course they accuse the other party
04:51 that's actually more tolerant as a
04:53 hundreds of years of history of being
04:56 tolerant and freeing slaves as being the
04:58 ones that do what their party does you
05:01 feel me so one you may need to regain
05:05 some EQ yourself or enhance the EQ that
05:09 you have understand that this is what
05:11 it's called but as you buy your kid a
05:14 game console a big fancy cell phone let
05:18 them hang out with the wrong kids when
05:20 they're really young when you get to
05:21 determine who they hang out with right
05:23 there's a point where they just throw a
05:25 big [ __ ] fit and all the sudden
05:26 parents go well I guess we're at that
05:28 point now where my kid can hang out
05:29 [ __ ] meth dealers you know none of
05:32 it's true
05:33 none of its true you're in control until
05:35 they're 18 the United States of America
05:37 at least but you want to start this as
05:40 soon as possible
05:42 so that you don't have a fight on your
05:44 hands you have a protocol a method that
05:47 they can live by that they understand
05:48 and explain it to them explain it to
05:51 them over and over and over throughout
05:54 the years not every single day but maybe
05:55 every year once a year you kind of take
05:57 a little break and you say how you
06:00 feeling kid you know do you feel fairly
06:02 self-aware you can look at their life
06:04 and find out if they can self manage you
06:07 can look at their life and see if
06:08 they're self motivated because a lot of
06:12 this is it's funny it ties back into
06:14 some of the programming models of the
06:17 hosts in Westeros and HBO and I'll keep
06:20 beating that up but I mean man just
06:22 having seen that and seeing the the
06:25 maize which is in the very first episode
06:27 not ruining anything for you and then
06:29 looking at this table looking at the
06:31 philosophy that is revealed over the
06:32 course of the first season about how all
06:35 the participants in programming the
06:37 hosts and try to figure out you know
06:38 artificial consciousness and then
06:40 eventually maybe real consciousness
06:41 right but this will also enhance your
06:45 life tremendously if you're trying to
06:47 take control sometimes you gain EQ when
06:53 you are in a situation that has been
06:55 bothering you but you didn't quite know
06:56 it and someone you fully wake up or at
06:58 least get to stage one of waking up
07:00 which is gonna be different for everyone
07:02 you start to go oh my god I hate my life
07:04 because look at what's going on
07:06 and then some people get depressed some
07:09 people get angry and it's like yeah skip
07:11 all those emotions man forget all that
07:13 crap all you need to focus on is the
07:16 positive super positive reality that now
07:21 you're in control you may not have all
07:24 the fixes in you may not even know what
07:26 to do next but the second you realize I
07:29 need to get out of this place I need to
07:31 get out of this rut I'm in this loop I'm
07:33 in you have control all of a sudden sit
07:37 and scheme design your life I'm gonna go
07:43 through the hemispheres of EQ and let's
07:47 parse each and every single one of them
07:48 so we sort of know what our checklist is
07:51 to be able to say to ourselves in the
07:53 mirror every morning I got you I got you
07:56 we're awake aren't we for good or better
08:00 or worse or whatever we're awake now the
08:07 first time is fear of EQ is
08:08 self-awareness what does it mean I mean
08:11 are we all self-aware I mean I think
08:14 therefore I am sort of thing well
08:17 probably on average the listeners that
08:20 listen to you know if you get to 10
08:22 shows you're pretty aware on this show I
08:25 would imagine but now here's the
08:28 interesting thing for yours truly
08:30 having been a tech geek my whole life
08:35 science geek and how life psychological
08:38 geek my whole life I mean for my
08:40 formative years I was doing it you know
08:42 researching it that sort of thing I was
08:45 always surrounded by kids not that many
08:47 but some super genius kids who probably
08:50 went off and got their PhDs but the
08:53 thing is is they were self-aware even
08:57 though some of them were they had these
08:59 other hemispheres some of them weren't
09:02 self-aware
09:02 now what would self-aware be defined as
09:05 well one seeing yourself as an
09:08 individual within the group of society
09:11 as one of the first milestones you see
09:13 yourself as an is a sovereign entity in
09:16 this world and you start questioning the
09:18 rules on you and you go well
09:20 I agree with these rules and for a lot
09:22 of them that protects you and your
09:23 safety you're gonna go hell yeah
09:24 you know murders are crime I know how to
09:26 keep that one cuz that it protects me
09:29 but I'm not sure it's such a coarse
09:31 brush concept I think it is more of a
09:35 minut concept and I'll explain I used to
09:41 have an employee great guy smarter than
09:45 you can imagine I mean really brilliant
09:47 programmer but I don't think he had full
09:51 self-awareness now you could just say he
09:55 just didn't give a [ __ ] about the things
09:57 I'm going to mention but I think it was
10:00 to a degree that was chronic and I think
10:04 it was in a in a category of
10:06 self-awareness that I had seen and have
10:09 seen although I haven't seen in a long
10:11 time
10:12 many people with his talent have this
10:15 lack of self-awareness especially
10:18 working in the video game industry for
10:19 so many years physical appearance is a
10:23 huge thing one of the things that your
10:28 geekier programmers at least back in the
10:30 day and this was this was a huge part of
10:33 like Revenge of the Nerds the movie
10:35 right because it had become a stereotype
10:37 that your your geekier nerdy guy didn't
10:42 have physical awareness of his or her
10:44 body I can't say much about seeing
10:47 females do this because sadly there
10:48 weren't a lot of female programmers when
10:51 I was a kid
10:52 hopefully there's a lot more today and
10:54 hopefully it gets a lot you know
10:57 increases many-fold and the near future
10:59 here but guys would come to work and
11:03 their hair would be bedhead which told
11:07 me one they never took a shower they got
11:09 out of bed put clothes on and came to
11:11 work yeah you know I honestly didn't
11:14 smell anybody bad I mean no one ever had
11:16 Bo I have no story of that and that's
11:18 talking about hundreds and hundreds of
11:20 people I've worked with over the years
11:21 so that's good but the other one is very
11:24 common in that their clothes that they
11:26 put on must have been in some hamper
11:30 some you know garbage bag
11:33 stuffed in there because they become to
11:37 work with clothes that were just they
11:39 look like wadded up tinfoil they've been
11:41 unfolded and put on and what's funny
11:46 about the last person I ran into he's
11:47 super handsome guy and so I'm sitting
11:49 there going I don't get it like this is
11:52 a dude they could get pretty much any
11:54 woman that he wanted and me at least get
11:56 the attention of the woman and he'd have
11:57 to solve the the the conversation and be
12:00 interesting as a person which I think he
12:02 was he was very well-read he's one who
12:05 gave me my first David Icke book to love
12:08 this guy but now here's what's really
12:11 strange out of the 200 days out of the
12:13 year I might have seen him face to face
12:15 working with him he would only do this
12:18 like maybe I don't know once once a
12:21 month maybe but there was a point when
12:23 he was doing it several days a week and
12:25 I was just shocked but this was
12:27 stereotypical of a bunch of geniuses
12:30 that I had worked for in the past and
12:32 worked with I should say and when you
12:37 see someone do it at a chronic level
12:38 you're realizing that their
12:40 self-awareness is at zero when they go
12:42 and look in the mirror they don't see
12:44 anything wrong when they put on horrible
12:46 clothing they don't I mean it's clean
12:48 clothing it's maybe it's okay clothing
12:50 but the idea is they're putting on stuff
12:52 that just makes them look like a hobo
12:53 and that impacts the way that you're
12:57 viewed you know we're all viewed or else
12:59 are we're all judged by the book cover
13:02 right as much as we know we shouldn't do
13:04 that if we don't do that we don't have a
13:07 sense of instinctual protection against
13:09 people who are potentially threats to us
13:11 so we develop it on an instinctual scale
13:14 and then we apply it at non
13:16 non-threatening scales like a nerd okay
13:18 you might judge the nerd you might judge
13:22 me I've got long hair you know I think
13:23 you know it's funny I walk into
13:25 restaurants around here and people will
13:28 every once in a while ago are you a
13:30 surfer and they want me to tell them my
13:33 name and that I'm some famous surfer I
13:34 could just tell and I'm like no and most
13:38 I'm a singer that's about it right you
13:41 know some people follow me around ask me
13:42 if I'm Jerry Cantrell
13:43 that's hilarious right
13:47 seriously that's happened and then some
13:49 people call me a woman before they
13:50 realize I turn around which is even
13:52 funnier I'm trying to keep track of
13:53 those you step in the other day but
13:56 there's that physical self-awareness and
13:59 then they're sort of that do you
14:00 participate in society awareness now how
14:03 many people do you know trust everything
14:05 they trust their government they trust
14:07 the police they trust everything and I'm
14:09 not saying that all these factions are
14:11 corrupt but they don't even think about
14:12 it they'll drive through one of these
14:13 drunk driving checkpoints which is a
14:15 complete violation of your rights I
14:18 don't support that [ __ ] whatsoever hey
14:21 don't [ __ ] pull over Society because
14:23 there's a couple [ __ ] go and work on
14:25 the laws so you can set outside of a bar
14:27 and when you see someone stumbling out
14:30 it's no longer entrapment it's hey
14:32 people drink here and people get in cars
14:34 and drive and kill people so I have the
14:38 goddamn right to set out in the parking
14:39 lot and watch you
14:41 in fact just sit in the parking lot with
14:43 a uniform on it
14:45 uber will make a ton of money and a
14:46 bunch of people will live including the
14:48 person who's walking out there but we've
14:50 turned drunk driving into a gigantic
14:52 business in California so we love it
14:54 when they get in the car and get busted
14:56 because it's fifteen thousand dollars in
14:58 fines they lose their driver's license
15:00 which probably increases public
15:02 transportation and it's just we got
15:04 people in the system now three of those
15:06 and you're gonna be in jail the rest
15:07 your life just that old saying you know
15:10 Amen a week we got all the solutions to
15:12 the world we could fix the whole planet
15:14 in a few months if we just stopped being
15:16 illogical about everything I don't think
15:20 it's entrapment
15:21 you know if someone walks up to you and
15:24 wants to say you cocaine you go yeah
15:26 okay you're busted was that entrapment
15:29 really you actually volunteered to take
15:32 an illegal drug home and it's my [ __ ]
15:35 fault you did that no no no by that but
15:37 anyway you see people with their heads
15:39 down and they just are indie rised
15:41 constantly especially when you drive you
15:43 see people drive like robots and you
15:46 know like they have no concept that
15:48 they're you know they have to take care
15:51 of their participation on the highway on
15:53 the roads or driving ten miles under the
15:55 speed limit
15:56 you know whatever they don't signal
15:59 whatever they're just not integrated
16:01 with society they are not aware that
16:04 they are participating and so their
16:05 self-awareness is zero or very very low
16:09 there are are you know and this this
16:14 comes from and there's habits that come
16:16 from different countries especially
16:18 countries that are overpopulated when
16:21 they come to America it's interesting I
16:24 haven't seen this in quite a while but
16:25 there used to be this thing where and
16:28 I'm not gonna pick on anyone in
16:30 particular but there was a particular
16:33 place where people come from and they
16:35 come here to Southern California and
16:36 you'll be standing in line to get food
16:39 to get coffee whatever and these people
16:42 will but right in front of you it's
16:45 because in their culture if they don't
16:46 do that they may not get food because
16:48 there's not enough in the line or
16:51 they're just pushing over there and so
16:53 they do it over here and eventually they
16:55 always learn not to do that but at first
16:58 you know they're just they don't know
16:59 they're not aware that they're in this
17:02 other culture and that we don't play
17:05 like that
17:05 you know so I think there's many many
17:08 levels to them but the self awareness
17:12 enables all the other hemispheres to
17:14 actually occur without self-awareness
17:16 you got nothing and so you know when
17:19 they used to ask kids what are you gonna
17:21 be when you grow up
17:22 that was the self-awareness conversation
17:24 you know you're eight years old and the
17:27 kids going and adults asking me a
17:29 question well that's the first thing
17:30 that's amazing Wow I'm equal enough to
17:32 ask to answer a big question like that
17:34 well I'm gonna be a fireman I want to be
17:36 a astronaut I want to be you know a
17:38 doctor whatever it is right movie star
17:40 rock star whatever it is
17:42 they get they got to choose and they get
17:45 to choose when that question is asked
17:46 which is why it's such an important
17:48 question it's a fun little question you
17:50 can ask kids all the time it gets them
17:52 dreaming and then if you're smart you'll
17:55 go to the next level and if somebody
17:56 says well you want to be an astronaut
17:59 yeah well why do you want to be an
18:00 astronaut well cuz I want to go into
18:02 space great well what do you think
18:03 you're gonna what are you gonna take in
18:05 school to make sure that when it comes
18:08 time for you to be an astronaut you know
18:10 what you need to do they may not know
18:12 the answer well I don't know what you
18:16 know what you probably should take what
18:17 well I think astronauts are really good
18:20 at math I think a lot of astronauts
18:22 actually become pilots so some of the
18:25 people join the Air Force and they get
18:26 to become really great pilots and then
18:28 they apply to NASA and they become the
18:31 pilot some people are just straight-up
18:32 scientists they're excellent biologists
18:35 or chemists or whatever whatever
18:36 whatever whatever and you get the kid to
18:39 start seeing their whole future at eight
18:40 years old or whatever age you ask them
18:44 now the next hemisphere is
18:47 self-management now I've got episodes on
18:50 this and season one I didn't make it
18:52 because I had read it and EQ duh you
18:55 know diagram or something right it's
18:58 because it's a core part of you getting
19:00 what you want in life maybe we'll just
19:03 take this little kids thing and make
19:05 sure we keep working that up if you
19:08 wanted a goal you have steps to get to
19:10 the goal and you know you need to
19:13 itemize those steps on a piece of paper
19:15 hopefully not a digital device but a
19:17 piece of paper and you go back to that
19:20 piece of paper maybe you hang it on the
19:21 wall and you got a checklist but you
19:24 might find out later on that one of the
19:25 steps you put down is actually ten steps
19:28 and you might want to make another piece
19:29 of paper they uh you know outline okay I
19:31 got ten little steps here and then this
19:32 one's done and then the next one oh it's
19:35 only one thing you need to do and well
19:37 that feels code you got a big one off
19:38 the big list right but the next one
19:40 downs 20 steps oh my gosh right but
19:43 you're going to have to manage your
19:46 entire life and the the problem with
19:50 society today as we know and the
19:54 Millennials are the ones getting
19:55 attacked the most for this lack of EQ I
20:00 think it is by design because I think
20:04 the people that create the problems for
20:07 EQ low EQ are the people that greenlight
20:11 through money projects that will rob a
20:14 person of their self-awareness robbed
20:16 them of any time in their life to manage
20:19 their lives right it's been your whole
20:21 life in your telephone
20:23 spend your whole life on some game
20:24 console or something something something
20:27 that isn't related to anything
20:28 productive in your life now sometimes
20:32 life just gets really busy and you get
20:34 into that loop you're going to work
20:36 you're saving money you're trying to do
20:37 something buy a house get married go on
20:40 a trip pay for an operation whatever it
20:43 is you're doing something very specific
20:45 so in that particular case you're kind
20:47 of getting distracted from one thing you
20:49 want to manage into fruition so that you
20:51 can bring another thing into fruition it
20:53 perhaps has a higher priority maybe less
20:58 less pizzazz but it's important and it's
21:01 strategic so don't feel bad if you get
21:02 into that situation either now one of
21:06 the biggest factors and one of the other
21:09 hemispheres to this EQ system relates
21:12 back to the self management situation it
21:17 is facilitated of course by the previous
21:19 one which is self-awareness and is the
21:22 hemisphere of motivation it should be
21:26 called self motivation to be honest how
21:29 do you motivate yourself how would you
21:33 even do that you have things that you
21:36 love and when you love something you
21:38 tend to gravitate to it which is the I
21:42 think it is the addiction dopamine
21:45 related mechanism of which those that
21:48 fund things that destroy your life okay
21:50 again they're fun things okay but
21:53 they're not things that are going to
21:55 reward you long-term and so you're
21:58 always stuck in a short-term goal if you
22:01 allow other folks and major corporations
22:03 and whatever entertainment streams to
22:06 replace your life with some spectator
22:09 sport but you have to figure out how to
22:12 motivate yourself you know I try on this
22:17 show I literally try to give you guys
22:19 every technique I've used for myself not
22:22 just a specific thing because I'm
22:24 different than you but the mechanisms I
22:26 use to dream up something to to motivate
22:30 myself Tony Robbins has a beautiful
22:32 technique which is to
22:34 very explicitly illustrate your final
22:39 product when you get your goal and
22:42 you're gonna have many goals in life so
22:44 don't think this is a one-off project so
22:46 for instance when you write screenplays
22:49 nobody cares if you write screenplays
22:52 until you're mega mega famous right
22:54 nobody cares but you have to do it and
22:56 you have to do it because you have
22:58 stories inside of you there are your
23:01 children there they're literally on the
23:02 other side of a membrane of
23:04 non-existence but their souls right
23:06 there and you can see it and you can see
23:08 it in all this beautiful detail but
23:09 until you write it down and make it
23:11 birth into this world it is just sitting
23:14 over there and there's not a single
23:15 human being on earth that knows that
23:17 exists unless you share the treatment
23:18 with somebody but sometimes you can
23:21 share your treatment so much you run out
23:23 of the steam just like Ray Bradbury said
23:25 you use up all the energy to talk and
23:28 talk and talk but you never write the
23:29 script so what I tell people is that and
23:34 it's an extreme thing that is not true
23:38 in its absolute sense but it's one way
23:40 that I use to motivate myself which is
23:43 to say nobody on earth really cares if
23:48 you live or die now it's not true
23:51 obviously your closest friends and your
23:52 family do care but they're always gonna
23:55 be there and they're that kind of hum in
23:57 your life the other way of looking at it
24:00 is nobody cares about anything that you
24:02 haven't done they care about the things
24:05 that you do what if Aerosmith or or God
24:10 always use them I don't really listen to
24:11 them that much but I love them because
24:13 they've lasted a really long time but
24:15 let's just say it's a big band these
24:18 days people like I don't know all the
24:23 big classics I mean right now we don't
24:25 really have a lot of like super duper
24:27 mega musicians that are out there today
24:30 just cranking it out like they used to
24:31 right but like I can MGMT or or the kind
24:38 of Empire of the Sun kind of musicians
24:40 if they told you that they have thought
24:44 of the best album in the world
24:46 how much do you care
24:48 other than get in the studio and make it
24:50 happen so I can hear it and what if I
24:53 gave you the option of listening to ten
24:55 hours of them talking about the album
24:58 that they haven't made or I give you an
25:00 hour to listen to the album that they
25:01 did make what's the difference you know
25:05 ten hours of talking about working well
25:08 that's one thing but you can't enjoy
25:10 that as much as you could probably enjoy
25:12 the album itself and it just becomes a
25:15 big tease and you can tease yourself so
25:20 you need to understand and and I'm going
25:22 to share with you again the trick that I
25:24 use to manage takeover management
25:26 positions at particular companies well
25:28 I'm the CEO or a director or whatever
25:32 you have to figure out the best day that
25:35 this company has ever had
25:36 when did it work and then you have to
25:42 replicate it again in the mid-90s at
25:46 probably 25 26 years old I realized that
25:49 the game of life is really about being
25:50 able to replicate perfection and not
25:53 just do a one-hit wonder and that means
25:56 that you have to turn yourself and your
25:58 mind into this exciting amazing thrilled
26:01 always motivated machine where you kind
26:04 of get inside your command center that
26:06 could make anything if any of you've
26:07 been a Doctor Who fan in your life think
26:10 about how amazing this character would
26:12 really feel in real life he's got a new
26:15 sidekick usually some beautiful woman
26:18 they come inside the TARDIS he lives
26:21 forever
26:22 he's like 1,100 1,200 years old or
26:24 whatever his ages nowadays by 1,500 at
26:26 this point but he comes into the TARDIS
26:28 that can travel any place in the
26:29 universe at any point in time
26:30 and so this this console that he comes
26:34 up to can can go anywhere how exciting
26:37 is that he can go and solve problems in
26:39 any hemisphere of time expecially in the
26:42 fictional world that is Doctor Who so he
26:45 has a machine to always crank out
26:46 episodes and plus when you get tired of
26:48 the actor and we just transformed the
26:50 guy you have to do that to yourself and
26:54 sometimes it requires that you redo your
27:00 world a little bit
27:01 sometimes it could be what's called the
27:03 Hawthorne effect you take your home
27:04 office which generally has every toy
27:06 that you never dreamed of having when
27:08 you were a kid one you want to evaluate
27:10 all the toys to see if one of them has
27:12 deprecated out of your esteem pool you
27:15 had this old keyboard it was amazing for
27:18 5 years you cranked out a couple albums
27:19 you participated in some keyboard way
27:21 but now it's not doing it for you
27:24 anymore so instead of buying an extra
27:25 rack to kind of put it up there out of
27:27 sight out of mind put it back in the box
27:29 put it away for a while if you never get
27:31 it out of the box in a year or two sell
27:33 it sell it for a decent price to someone
27:36 else who's gonna find that keyboard one
27:38 of the most amazing energizing things in
27:40 the world so then you're contributing to
27:42 the universe in a kind of a an ancillary
27:46 way right but then once you figure out
27:49 everything in your office that it
27:50 motivates you move everything around
27:52 move your desk to the other side of the
27:54 room clean it up get rid of all the crap
27:57 and throw some [ __ ] away and it all
28:01 worked out
28:01 and then every day you go back in your
28:03 office for a couple years at least
28:05 you're gonna feel motivated again
28:07 because you've redone your life it's
28:09 gonna be fun using myself as an example
28:13 when you write screenplays you will
28:17 definitely have a moment when you were
28:19 absolutely knee deep neck deep into a
28:22 script and there is no there's no break
28:26 that can happen because you have a
28:27 deadline but until the deadline shows up
28:30 and you want to probably crank out a
28:32 script about every four months because
28:36 that's what a professional has to do so
28:37 why do anything less than that you know
28:40 you might to build up to that you get
28:42 your machine working right go see my
28:43 episodes on screenwriting if you're a
28:45 screenwriter you'll you'll speed up
28:46 pretty quickly but anyway I will write
28:50 two or three things at once
28:52 now what ends up happening is that I'll
28:55 write something in treatment form and
28:58 something else in script form and
28:59 another one just in my head and I'll
29:02 think about it and think about it think
29:04 about I got a dictaphone with me at all
29:05 times I'm always taking notes and
29:07 usually when I read it out in my
29:09 dictaphone I remember it 90% 95%
29:14 and everyone so I'll go back and comb
29:16 through all the episodes to see where I
29:19 left a note that just to make sure I
29:21 crossed all the T's and dotted all the
29:23 eyes but you being self-aware and
29:26 understanding what motivates you and
29:28 then being able to plan your goal which
29:32 is self-management and I'm giving you a
29:35 very clinical work example this doesn't
29:38 have to be a work example but the I
29:40 think the analogy goes over a lot better
29:42 there's like a little bit of honey in
29:44 that algorithm of life if you couldn't
29:47 apply it to something that you
29:48 completely understand but it could be
29:50 you losing some weight you getting some
29:51 rock-hard abs you being nicer to people
29:56 going out and meeting people if you're
29:57 too introverted but now the next
30:00 hemisphere is the one where it comes up
30:03 the most in my circles and I'm working
30:11 on a project right now with some other
30:12 genius friends of mine where this is
30:15 gonna be a big deal
30:16 and hopefully yours truly will get to
30:18 contribute some writing to it and that's
30:24 empathy a lot of people think EQ means
30:27 empathy quota and I think that's great
30:30 it's actually emotional is the word but
30:34 empathy is sort of the first level of an
30:38 IQ test of being a true human being as
30:41 we are intended to be which is that you
30:45 don't just feel sorry for someone else
30:47 that's sympathy right I got a whole
30:49 episode on empathy if you're interested
30:51 in that subject matter but empathy is
30:53 your ability to feel someone else's
30:55 feelings and then using your own
30:58 self-awareness manage your communication
31:00 and interaction with other human beings
31:02 based on their emotions and is one of
31:05 the toughest tests that we can have as
31:06 human beings and you can be extremely
31:09 empathetic in one area of your life and
31:11 have no empathy another area of your
31:13 life and then you could be strategically
31:14 non empathetic because you feel like
31:17 someone needs a kick in the ass but you
31:20 could maybe do it an empathetic way well
31:22 they're gonna respond to you more now I
31:25 said there's a couple times on the show
31:26 when I was a kid I heard the fur
31:29 you know treat others as you would treat
31:31 yourself and I'm not sure that's ever
31:34 been written down because the other one
31:36 is just love your neighbor and love
31:37 yourself just left it quiet like that
31:39 without some obligation of how to behave
31:42 very specifically towards anyone else
31:45 and the problem that I ran into was that
31:47 I know that my independence as a kid was
31:52 one being left to my own devices quite a
31:54 bit but anytime I you know got weak as a
31:58 child and cried my father would mock cry
32:01 in front of me which looks very very
32:04 mean but the interesting thing is it it
32:11 ends that blubbering crap really quick
32:13 in your life
32:14 I don't remember crying past the age of
32:16 like four or five I mean a night last
32:20 time I remembered it happening I think I
32:23 was like three years old four years old
32:25 and I was in the living room that my
32:27 parents had converted a garage it's
32:29 11:05 West fourth she knew Kansas six
32:31 six seven two eight six six six seventy
32:34 two zero
32:34 I was in the garage that's now turning
32:36 to part of the house my family did that
32:38 and I remember crying for some reason my
32:44 dad was just blubbering and my mother
32:46 was yelling at him and hitting him you
32:48 know funny you know punching me but she
32:50 was like stop dad's thought that you
32:51 know and he was I think right it makes
32:57 you have a thick skin you don't have to
32:59 be a thick skinned child to endure that
33:01 you become thick skin because of it and
33:03 yeah you might hate your dad for a
33:05 little while but in the end hey if he's
33:07 the guy that's willing to take the sling
33:09 of the arrow from you in a sense that I
33:11 don't like my dad as much as like my mom
33:13 cuz she's always nice and she listens to
33:14 me cry like a baby like a little [ __ ]
33:17 and my father's like there's no crying
33:20 in baseball man the [ __ ] up and and live
33:22 your life right sorry for the profanity
33:24 but come on I know all my videos are
33:27 gonna get like seventeen and above
33:29 Anjali so when I started seeing the
33:33 success in my life because i nutted up
33:36 after four or five years old and just
33:38 hate it you know you hurt yourself and
33:40 unless it's extreme pain
33:42 where you're not crying as a protest
33:45 towards something happening to you
33:47 you're merely expressing this I have so
33:50 much pain in my body I need to like let
33:51 it out verbally you know so there's like
33:54 that thing I've had that happened to me
33:55 a couple times but I couldn't treat
33:59 people the way I treated myself because
34:01 I was absolutely tough on myself and I
34:04 loved it I still dig it to this day you
34:07 know there's so many kids so especially
34:09 Millennials and I don't mean to pick on
34:10 anybody but even Gen Z's I hear people
34:13 say this work hard play hard thing and
34:15 they love that phrase and they feel like
34:16 a big baller when they say it but they
34:19 have never worked hard and played hard
34:20 in their [ __ ] life are they played
34:21 hard but they don't work hard they don't
34:23 they don't have a definition of working
34:25 hard half the time now kids that get
34:27 into Hollywood and succeed they know
34:30 what it's like and at any age it can be
34:33 a djinns ear and they said on a set for
34:36 14 16 18 hours they get four hours of
34:39 sleep they're the first people on the
34:41 set the last people to leave they're
34:44 having to endure like very cranky
34:46 directors or cranky you know set hands
34:49 and you know you just have to take it
34:50 because you know that's not personal
34:52 it's that day has been very difficult
34:54 and there's little patience and
34:56 everyone's patience pool and so part of
34:59 the big algorithm for success especially
35:02 if you want to work for CEOs like every
35:04 single company I've ever worked for I
35:05 have worked I start off low and within
35:08 six months I am working for the CEO in
35:12 some capacity I still have my job in the
35:14 company but the CEOs go you know they
35:17 figure out that I'm a special ops guy
35:19 and they look I need you to help me put
35:22 together a presentation either maybe
35:25 it's graphic maybe it's writing better
35:27 words doing something miraculous that no
35:30 one in the world's ever done and then
35:33 you move up but they're they're not care
35:36 they're not they're not hired to be the
35:39 CEO because they're a big emotional bag
35:41 of problems right they're hard to be the
35:43 CEO because they're rock hard when they
35:45 need to be and when they come home they
35:47 need to shed that whole mechanism and
35:50 kneel on one knee and give their little
35:53 daughter a kiss on the cheek and a big
35:55 hug
35:55 their son you know they need to do this
35:57 and then treat those spouse correctly
35:58 which you know whichever sucks that is
36:00 right
36:01 and so that's why they become very
36:03 professional now I have seen miraculous
36:06 things online with younger Millennials
36:09 and I'll tell you the I mentioned this
36:11 one time in all the episodes and I'll
36:13 mention it again now I've seen several
36:16 videos where people who are drunk end up
36:20 going to the wrong home and I don't know
36:22 how the hell they get in these homes
36:23 there's no sign of burglary going
36:25 through a window or anything but
36:27 something else someone leaves a door
36:28 unlocked and someone will come in drunk
36:30 and end up sleeping on the sofa and
36:33 they're so wasted that they don't you
36:35 won their approach they don't know who
36:37 they are what's going on but you know
36:40 that's a that's a very tumultuous risky
36:45 situation that maybe the person wakes up
36:47 drunk and there's been classic
36:50 situations where I once had two heard
36:53 the test I heard the testimony of some
36:55 documentary where a guy was had a
36:58 shotgun in his house
36:59 it's his self-defense mechanism and he
37:03 heard some guy in his house and he walk
37:04 he goes up and he goes down the hallway
37:06 and the drunk thought that the guy was
37:08 in his house and so here he comes and
37:10 the dude had no choice you know and he
37:14 shot him I'm he probably had a choice
37:16 but then you have to be physically
37:17 capable of defending yourself against a
37:19 drunk and let me tell you unless you
37:21 know how to fight these drunks will take
37:22 you out because they don't feel anything
37:24 so a guy killed him and he regretted
37:27 every single second of it but he goes
37:29 what the hell was I supposed to do but
37:30 I've seen some Millennials come out with
37:33 no guns and talked to these guys on the
37:35 sofa and luckily they're not the
37:37 belligerent violent kind that this other
37:39 guy happened to encounter and the go hey
37:41 man what are you doing and the guys will
37:43 wake up and they'd be some tough some of
37:45 them are like oh my god where am I you
37:46 know but most of them nine out of ten
37:48 they're still wasted they don't know
37:50 where they are and they you know what
37:51 you got to go man you know okay and then
37:54 some people will beg can I just sleep
37:55 here for the night you know and of
37:57 course she'd what are you supposed to do
37:59 you can't go to bed with some stranger
38:00 in your house who knows what the hell
38:01 they'll do the answer is always no so
38:04 I've seen this super advanced empathy
38:07 from some of these Millennials
38:09 so so all hope isn't lost right now
38:12 empathy has been used as a weapon now
38:15 and it's being used by the globalists
38:17 and currently the the cortes you know
38:21 crazy absolute certifiable [ __ ] crazy
38:25 Democrats which are just a few of them
38:26 but there's enough of them they own all
38:28 the press so we got to be aware of
38:29 what's going on there hopefully this
38:31 episode in those references become
38:33 something of the past but so let's give
38:36 you an example of how corporations are
38:39 using people and especially the
38:40 Democratic Party to harm you all the
38:45 corporations that want to feed you
38:46 horrible food to in your life short but
38:48 they also want to sell their there you
38:51 know there was a sucrose and all that
38:54 the gall look all the crosses are gross
38:55 right they want to sell you a bunch of
38:57 crappy food constantly McDonald's every
38:59 single fast-food place is so on you
39:01 should the grocery stores are full of so
39:03 much GMO and crap it's horrible right ok
39:06 well what happens when you eat all this
39:08 crap you get super unhealthy and you get
39:12 fat you become obese now I always
39:16 preface it like this there are people on
39:18 this world who are big people and they
39:20 have big bones and they can be extremely
39:23 handsome or beautiful at their level of
39:26 giant nests right so it's just and this
39:28 is without any thyroid problems of any
39:30 kind ok
39:32 they're just big people and so I'm not
39:35 talking about those people I'm talking
39:37 about you know you're you're five foot
39:39 one girl who's you know four feet wide
39:42 you're you're six foot guy that weighs
39:45 450 pounds without amp without some
39:49 medical condition it's because they've
39:51 been probably disenfranchised in their
39:53 life because of all the mechanisms that
39:55 make life suck right you know economic
39:57 booms and busts bad education
40:01 bad you know badge occasionally - no job
40:03 opportunities and so they live inside
40:05 food they become a foodie an eater they
40:08 eat it for pleasure
40:08 so people have abusive situations in
40:11 their world and they retreat to food
40:12 because the only thing happy in their
40:13 life but some people are just lazy they
40:17 don't have anything wrong with your life
40:18 and they're just eating and eating and
40:20 eating as if there's no
40:22 to their heart their inner fat I mean
40:25 it's it's really tough really tough but
40:27 then they're gonna complain the second
40:28 they get ill you know it's crazy this is
40:31 in the movie branded the first half of
40:33 this equation is in the movie branded
40:35 which they tried to say just literally
40:37 say we're gonna sell fat to everybody
40:39 again there's products you can move
40:41 they're cheap to make so there you go
40:43 but what do they do they know there was
40:46 going to be a backlash against obesity
40:49 obesity reports come out every single
40:51 year Mexico is finally I think
40:53 overtaking America for obesity damnit
40:57 Mexico here's the thing they then
41:01 enlists a bunch of empathetic people
41:05 supposedly kind of fo empathy people
41:08 they don't really have a discernment on
41:09 top of their empathy meaning they don't
41:11 have any discretion on top of what we
41:13 would be feeling empathy for and so
41:15 they've created the shame movement to
41:20 say you're not allowed to say someone is
41:21 fat because that's to shame them
41:23 remember that big fat girl in the movie
41:25 theater trying to mess with Milo and she
41:28 was just I mean she was four times as
41:30 big as she should ever be but she's
41:32 screaming and yelling in because she
41:33 hates herself rachel looks in that
41:35 mirror but she doesn't want you to tell
41:37 her that she should lose some weight cuz
41:39 you want her to be okay in life right
41:41 and so then she has to be accountable
41:43 and that's a tough thing for her because
41:45 she's so addicted all the food she's
41:46 eating and drinking right so they create
41:49 this shame movement so they have these
41:52 idiots towing the shame movement to
41:56 fight you from trying to make people you
41:59 know or started it's re trying to get
42:01 rid of the corporations that feed us all
42:02 this horrible food unreal it's a
42:07 mechanism and so you have these
42:11 individuals that's why this episode I
42:13 think is tremendously important this is
42:14 a mental weapon against you this is an
42:16 intellectual technology that is being
42:19 used against you and if they can get rid
42:21 of you the good empathy and accentuate
42:25 the bad epithelia you know it was cycle
42:31 on b as some air freshener in your house
42:34 and if you don't like zyklon-b then
42:37 you're a-- you're a poison Shemer
42:38 right when you get all of these things
42:44 self-awareness self-management you can
42:48 handle your motivation you get into your
42:50 empathy a qualified empathy an
42:53 intelligent empathy then you have
42:57 something called social skills why
43:00 because you have been paying attention
43:01 to society and especially yourself now
43:05 here's the thing that they've discovered
43:06 about EQ versus IQ in my entire lifetime
43:10 the the there's some exceptions okay
43:15 this is why the exceptions are so
43:16 amazing and this was why when people
43:18 have IQ and EQ at a really high level
43:23 they become amazing human beings that
43:25 you want to be around okay
43:27 people in my life have got PhDs
43:31 I remember so many there have been so
43:37 many situations in my life where an
43:40 employer will be super excited to hire a
43:42 PhD and the first one I was young in my
43:45 20s my early 20s which is when I really
43:48 started working with multiple PhDs
43:51 the inventor of TurboTax which again was
43:53 called Mac and tax back in the day
43:54 Michael Morgan he had a PhD from I
43:57 believe in mighty I think that's where
44:00 he got his PhD from I could have that
44:01 wrong but I think that's right he was a
44:04 very recluse
44:05 very tall I mean he was like six foot
44:07 four or more giant guy huge heart and
44:11 this guy very quiet
44:13 he was very calculated with every every
44:15 answer he ever gave we used to have this
44:17 joke about him you could ask him what
44:18 what one plus one is and what's the
44:20 answer to life the universe and
44:21 everything he'll take the equal
44:23 excruciating amount of time to give an
44:25 answer but both answers will be right
44:27 that's what kind of guy he was
44:29 there's a neat dude and very few of us
44:32 ever got a chance to be really side by
44:34 side with a guy he would only come into
44:35 work maybe a couple times a year and sit
44:39 down with us and explain to us the new
44:41 thing that he had created
44:43 he liked to work at home because he was
44:46 a pH D high IQ recluse now that's about
44:51 all I know about that guy I don't know
44:52 if he was a you know the biggest teddy
44:55 bear with his kids and played Santa
44:57 Claus on who actually was Jewish
44:58 whatever whatever he might have played
45:00 right I don't know but the other phd's I
45:04 ended up working with were sort of a
45:06 liability to the company they had quarks
45:11 and weird things about them they wanted
45:13 to recreate their homes at work and so
45:15 sometimes we'd have to outfit offices
45:17 with bizarre things like an EI we had
45:21 programmers which I don't know if they
45:23 had PhDs but they had the equivalent
45:24 thereof and they would require that we
45:27 gave them not necessarily an office but
45:29 they would you know the way that the
45:31 video game companies usually work is
45:33 it's a big you know catacomb of sort of
45:36 space right so you might have like one
45:38 area that's sort of smaller in its open
45:41 area design than other big areas and so
45:44 they would sequester it off and get
45:46 black sheets they'd hang it all up make
45:49 a huge tent like a big giant fort like a
45:52 little kid and inside they'd have their
45:54 world and you'd walk in it was super
45:56 cool man they have toys and LED lights
46:00 and you know all kinds of wild stuff in
46:01 there not for their light source but we
46:05 always use the monitor as a light source
46:07 or an incandescent light bulb so we
46:08 don't lose our lighting in the color
46:10 correction it's in the game but after
46:13 the age of about maybe twenty three or
46:15 so I never thought that a PhD level
46:18 person without meeting them first
46:21 especially in the engineering world was
46:24 a asset more than a liability they also
46:27 have short attention spans or they will
46:29 have quarks were very remedial things in
46:33 life will totally throw them off in life
46:35 they might go off and need a religious
46:38 retreat for two weeks some spiritual
46:40 retreat because they're just bizarre
46:41 people and they making tons of money so
46:44 they got all the mobility in the world
46:45 that you could possibly imagine and they
46:48 have all those self-awareness issues I
46:50 talked about earlier so what they found
46:53 out is that super high IQ
46:56 typically means a lack of social skills
46:58 and it may be the the sacrifice they
47:01 made when they were young to be smart
47:03 they didn't go outside party and play
47:05 they stayed inside and learned and
47:07 learned and practice their art so it's
47:09 you know it's something that's a yin and
47:11 yang perhaps the universe needs and we
47:13 need to figure out a way to be
47:14 empathetic to them and facilitate their
47:18 needs but we also need to communicate
47:19 with them empathetically to get them to
47:22 do what they need to do for the company
47:25 but also to make sure they know that
47:27 we're on their side and to maybe walk a
47:29 few steps towards you you know more
47:32 towards that self-awareness thing you
47:33 know I had a good friend of mine while
47:37 we're on the subject heart of gold
47:40 very smart guy absolutely lived inside
47:44 videogames and he had severe
47:47 motivational problems he could motivate
47:50 himself to get his character to the
47:51 highest level of a videogame even if it
47:53 took playing you know 17 hours a day for
47:56 two weeks he literally take vacation to
47:57 do that when a game released right but
48:00 one time we were at a role-playing AK
48:02 event and I had to take him home one day
48:06 and I think we had had a little bit of
48:09 like wine coolers or something like that
48:11 this is over 20 years ago probably over
48:15 25 years ago and he broke down in the
48:17 cart with me and he was sobbing all of a
48:22 sudden and I never seen this guy get
48:24 emotional ever he was always he was
48:27 sensitive but I mean he wasn't I got to
48:29 cry and he starts crying like really
48:32 hard I think I mentioned this one since
48:36 he's in one or something and so I'm
48:39 trying to figure out why he's crying but
48:41 he's crying at this sudden 100% pace and
48:45 so I have to wait for him to get through
48:48 some of these emotions before I can talk
48:49 to the guy and it's just he and I in the
48:52 car I'm driving he's my passenger taking
48:54 him home and I said you know what's
48:57 wrong - what's wrong you know just tell
48:59 me when whenever you get a chance tell
49:01 me what's going on man and he said first
49:03 thing he said was he goes I really want
49:05 to thank you for being my friend
49:08 I was like a while you're gonna melt my
49:10 heart here dude and I said well you know
49:13 what can I do for you what can this
49:15 friend do for you man and he said well
49:17 you know and there's a happy ending to
49:19 this story in so many words he told me
49:23 he goes man I've just never been able to
49:29 get with women like you guys do and he
49:36 says you know I don't want to be alone
49:38 man I I love women and I just don't know
49:41 what what I'm doing and he goes I wasn't
49:43 raised by my father and his dad was
49:46 alive his job was just you know didn't
49:48 stay with the families raised by his mom
49:50 his mom was super cool and really a
49:53 brilliant woman she had taught him to
49:54 speak four or five different languages
49:56 so he could like speak one sentence and
49:58 he would use different words in
49:59 different languages because they had
50:01 better definitions they were there were
50:03 more complete words and he would teach
50:06 his stuff all the time and so so I had
50:12 never had anyone approached me like that
50:14 I was like well geez I never under got
50:15 never really thought about this right
50:17 now
50:18 so obviously I'm in there he's one of my
50:21 best friends in the entire world and so
50:24 I told him I said man you know whatever
50:26 you need whatever time you want to spend
50:29 in this game you know I'll show you
50:33 everything I know so everything I know
50:34 and we started going over some very
50:36 basic things with the opposite sex and I
50:39 mean you could its advice that women can
50:40 take and men can take and it's
50:41 essentially my my core belief in in
50:45 attracting the opposite sex is to make
50:47 sure that you are a positive in their
50:49 life more than a negative and then be as
50:52 genuine as you possibly can don't BS and
50:54 if you have to change who you are to be
50:56 that person than change go ahead you're
50:59 gonna dig it - trust me trust me now the
51:02 funny thing about this guy is that just
51:06 makes me smile just thinking about it he
51:08 became a baller okay he became I have no
51:13 idea where he is today but we met a
51:15 cluster of three young ladies
51:20 one of my friends in that group ended up
51:22 marrying one of the ladies and they have
51:24 a beautiful family it's great but this
51:27 guy hooked up with the other two I want
51:30 at one at a time
51:31 unbelievable and one of them is deer has
51:34 passed unfortunately but I found out
51:38 later that he was like we're over
51:40 because he's you know I used to play man
51:42 used to come to my house and bring his
51:43 PlayStation and he'd play a Final
51:46 Fantasy and he's amazing he's amazing
51:48 and everything he doesn't a video game
51:49 let me tell you all these guys are and I
51:52 just sit and watch and he just plain I'd
51:54 watch you know it was like it was the
51:55 most entertaining thing ever and we
51:57 start talking he's like oh yeah yeah you
52:00 know in a very respectful way he said he
52:03 had hooked up with her and it was very
52:06 you know respectful and and they knew
52:09 what they were doing and he's a great
52:10 guy and so they were cool it was just
52:13 funny so he changed himself and one
52:16 thing we started doing right away was
52:18 that I said we got to get out we got to
52:20 start going to clubs cuz we were young
52:22 in our mid-20s I said well let's go to
52:24 clubs man and this is where this
52:25 happened it was within maybe three or
52:27 four months of fest moment where he had
52:30 become self-aware and he needed help in
52:33 the motivation room and he was fully
52:35 capable of managing the situation he had
52:38 empathy running you know dripping out of
52:40 him and he was super empathetic about
52:42 everything he's a sweet sweet guy like
52:45 that and so in fact he was with me on
52:50 several occasions but one of my
52:52 companies that I named after this
52:55 mechanism of replicating perfection he
52:57 was in the office with me and we talked
52:58 for three or four hours and I finally
53:00 just got it it eventually got me my
53:03 full-time gig at EA so I went from
53:05 contractor to full-time he's the one
53:07 that did it he just looked in the
53:09 database and went oh yeah here's a job
53:10 right here head of web developers was
53:13 like really and so that was cool so I've
53:18 seen these cycles occur I've seen people
53:20 go from zero to hero man multiple times
53:23 in my life and usually it takes some
53:25 sort of Epiphany some sort of moment
53:29 sometimes you just like he he just got
53:31 tired of being alone
53:33 by himself he wasn't he was becoming
53:36 self-aware by himself and there was no
53:39 social media there was no internet to
53:41 speak up at the time when he was
53:42 becoming self-aware you made the changes
53:45 and did it okay but the EQ people can
53:50 manage other people better because one
53:53 you've gone through your own path in
53:55 life and like I I say several times you
53:59 know the biggest mistake that the ruling
54:02 class is made in this world is creating
54:04 a bunch of suffering human beings
54:05 because there is nothing more self-aware
54:09 motivating than to suffer it is the
54:13 whole Keystone cornerstone of the host
54:17 programming in West world Atari that's
54:20 what they said suffering everyone has
54:22 some story in their life where they
54:24 suffered and they dug themselves out of
54:25 suffering and then BOOM they had this
54:28 amazing unique personality so when you
54:31 suffer a bunch you start to look at the
54:34 reasons why you're suffering now the
54:36 problem is we have a political party
54:37 that's trying to harvest that that
54:40 moment so let's just say my friend let's
54:44 take him as a hypothetical he is feeling
54:47 this loneliness thing and he wants to be
54:50 with other people but instead of telling
54:52 me a person that's going to invest in
54:54 him and get him what he wants based on
54:57 his desires his goals his principles his
55:01 standards in life this political party
55:04 comes in and says you know why you are
55:07 alone because of those people because of
55:11 that race right there let me feel me
55:15 this is why we're in a very very
55:18 tumultuous stage and so what would have
55:21 happened to my friends EQ it would have
55:23 gone back down if he had but if he had
55:26 bit this offer he would have become a
55:29 racist he would have become intolerant
55:32 of everything fascism would be sold to
55:35 him in an anti-fascist group the devil
55:39 flips things right Devils not real but
55:42 these people are as evil as it gets they
55:45 don't care if you end up
55:47 dead crying goalless dreamless in a
55:51 ditch did you vote for him that's all
55:54 they care did you empower them so they
55:56 can continue doing this to other people
55:58 now unfortunately this show for you guys
56:02 I mix my own personal opinions into
56:05 generic topics so I am probably unless
56:10 you have the ability and all of you do
56:12 to filter out anything you disagree with
56:14 and and still take the perhaps the
56:18 wisdom that I have shaken out of the
56:20 knowledge that I have experienced then
56:24 maybe you can get to some of these
56:26 things in some of the videos and again
56:28 way back in season one which I'm now
56:29 rewatching because of the remastering
56:32 process
56:33 I'm much better back then about putting
56:36 in my own opinions but now 375 videos
56:39 believe me my opinions starting to
56:42 become the way that I can motivate
56:43 myself to do these episodes right one of
56:47 the areas I want to share with you where
56:50 I had to upgrade myself and this
56:54 probably happened in the last ten years
56:55 in a very active way and I've kind of
56:59 beat around the bush in previous
57:01 episodes about this particular stage of
57:03 my life but I'm just gonna go head-on
57:04 with it right now I was of the opinion
57:11 that when I would see people my own age
57:14 and this is where I drew the line plus
57:17 or minus maybe five years or so or or
57:20 you're at a point where I think that you
57:23 are so far regressed in your own
57:25 progress like a friend of mine is maybe
57:28 in his he or she is in in their mid-30s
57:31 but they're acting like they're you know
57:33 nineteen years old with no clue or even
57:36 less they're not acting like children as
57:39 a human being but they just their goals
57:40 in life and where they want to be they
57:42 know exactly where they want to be you
57:44 know where they don't want to be which
57:45 is where they are but they're acting
57:47 really wimpy with their life so I spent
57:52 a lot of time in my life at times trying
57:55 to make everything smell like cherries
57:57 for everybody
57:59 and so the problem was that it didn't
58:05 work very well me sitting around
58:08 spending a tremendous amount of time to
58:10 kind of go well you know maybe you
58:11 should do this and maybe that maybe this
58:13 the minute I gave them any out any
58:16 methodology to keep soft to hang on to
58:19 their their lack of motivation or their
58:23 excuse pool their crutch their leaning
58:26 on so that they don't get their life
58:27 they never snapped out of it on average
58:30 as some people are brilliant at this
58:33 there's been so many movies out there
58:36 where writers have written these heroes
58:38 both on the male and female side where
58:40 someone is struggling in the old grandpa
58:42 or grandmother walks in the room and
58:44 goes you want to do that any well you
58:46 know and far be it for me to stop you
58:50 but have you ever thought about this and
58:51 that thing is like the boom when the
58:53 script were you're like whoa and then
58:54 the person goes oh yeah I never thought
58:57 about that
58:58 and then they're enlightened and then
58:59 they become more self-aware and then
59:01 they motivate away from that horrible
59:04 goal that they might have I think one of
59:06 the arcs that's really famous is someone
59:08 will want to seek physical revenge in a
59:12 script and there's something there's
59:14 some contest going on this is yeah
59:16 there's this is one my buddy wrote this
59:17 too and his script where there's like a
59:20 car race or something as an example and
59:23 someone you know the the guy that's
59:26 going to lose goes over and tampers with
59:28 our hero's car so it doesn't run very
59:30 well maybe it even destroys it and it's
59:33 like they've got just a minimum amount
59:36 of time to fix this car and so the guys
59:38 like I'm gonna go over beat his head in
59:40 and then you know the grandfather comes
59:41 in or someone else comes in and says why
59:44 don't you just beat him in the race he's
59:45 like well I can't you know and then if
59:47 the music starts the montage goes and
59:49 they'd be rebuild the car overnight and
59:50 sure enough it doesn't look as good as
59:52 it used to but they they win and they
59:54 stick it to the other person that
59:58 happens but in my life
60:01 I I had a point probably between the age
60:05 of 25 and say 40 or when I saw someone
60:10 being a wimp
60:12 I would motivate them very nicely I
60:16 wasn't really putting a tremendous
60:18 amount of bowl of cherries on but I
60:19 wouldn't be course with them or anything
60:21 but the more they kept replicating in
60:23 Sandy doing the same stupid thing that
60:27 never turns out to you know to benefit
60:30 them I would lean into them lovingly but
60:35 I would lean into them and I would let
60:36 him know exactly how stupid I thought
60:39 what they were doing was and I'd say you
60:42 know and it would be very constructive
60:43 at the same time by saying look you're
60:45 too good for this [ __ ] that you're
60:46 doing you're too nice to act mean you're
60:49 too smart to act dumb you've done so
60:51 many amazing things in your life you're
60:53 surrounded by a great family that has
60:54 done a bunch a bunch of amazing things
60:56 but even if you didn't have that you can
60:58 look around the world that people that
60:59 have the goals that you want why can't
61:01 you just usurp them take what's good and
61:03 leave everything else behind and they're
61:06 usually very shocked emotionally oh man
61:09 tell me what you really think right and
61:11 now you know and they know I'm loving
61:13 them at the same exact time but you know
61:16 it can get I can get extreme let me tell
61:18 you because I don't believe in lying to
61:20 anybody for any reason whatsoever it
61:23 just doesn't help you know and when you
61:26 tell someone that someone's something
61:27 you know it's all gonna be okay you're
61:29 not lying to him you just don't know
61:31 exactly when that's going to occur right
61:33 but after a while of doing this and
61:36 especially dating the same person for a
61:38 really long time
61:38 they eventually lean over they go look
61:40 could you be a little nicer during these
61:42 situations you know and so I've been
61:45 modifying err ever-so-slight because I
61:49 know my other system does work I'm just
61:51 not the most popular guy at the end of
61:53 the cycle you know and I had a buddy of
61:56 mine who's a fairly well-known comedian
61:58 coast to coast and he he was gonna give
62:07 you a situation where it worked and I
62:09 didn't have to get at all
62:11 cantankerous with this guy at all but he
62:14 he and I told the story once before but
62:17 he said well his father had passed away
62:19 he's got the biggest heart on planet
62:22 earth he's got a great wife great life
62:25 and he he was at his father's deathbed I
62:30 think at a December timeframe and he and
62:33 I've been trying to get together for
62:34 like a year now we keep planning it and
62:36 we just both get busy he gets to fly
62:37 around the world to do his thing
62:39 but anyway his father told him on his
62:42 death but he goes get back on stage
62:44 because he had started using there's
62:48 there's other methods he knows how to
62:49 make money with that is is very reliable
62:52 and you know comedy is a fairly reliable
62:55 way for him to make money as well but
62:57 it's very tough on the on the system you
62:59 know he has to leave home a lot and he's
63:00 on the road a lot so just you know you
63:02 beat you down and once you hit you know
63:04 45 that can get a little tougher so I
63:08 didn't know this that his father had
63:10 said this and he and I had started
63:11 hanging out March I actually drove up to
63:13 see him and and in fact know he and I
63:15 were on the telephone first and I think
63:17 he had actually come down to see me and
63:20 I wanted to see him and I went back home
63:22 and what I had told him was I said look
63:24 you know what are you doing with your
63:26 life right now I'm doing this other
63:28 thing really I said that doesn't sound
63:32 like the best use of this brilliant mind
63:34 that I'm looking at I said you know you
63:36 I've seen you own crowds on levels that
63:39 it's unbelievable why one of the first
63:41 gigs I ever got him booked at he he got
63:46 picked for to be on a pilot and I
63:49 managed to book a gig for everyone on
63:51 the pilot was a comedy show and we were
63:56 you know building a pilot for television
63:58 so all the comedians were we got a one
64:02 of the gigs was at a restaurant we did
64:04 lots of restaurants with this kid cuz I
64:05 have a live performance thing it's been
64:08 anyway all the comedians were told to
64:09 keep it clean because this is TV you
64:12 know all the comedians are really
64:13 intense and creative when you're when
64:15 they're in Los Angeles like I've told
64:16 you guys a couple times but he is
64:18 sitting there watching these guys come
64:20 up and people were starting to drop the
64:22 really acidic you know I mean like I
64:24 don't know it's super a funny [ __ ] but
64:26 really some of the darker blue or humor
64:28 right and everyone's dying everyone's
64:30 loving these comedians going up and
64:32 doing their thing but my buddy he's
64:34 looking around going you know he's
64:35 talking to me he's like I thought this
64:37 is supposed to be cleaning I said yeah
64:38 we told everyone to keep it clean
64:40 so we reissued the you know directive
64:42 guys you have to clean this up otherwise
64:44 nothing none of this will be usable and
64:46 so they did kind of Peter out but one
64:49 guy just before him because they were
64:51 going in rounds to me people laughs he
64:54 tells this blue joke
64:56 and so my buddy's looking at me like
64:58 alright I can do this game he walks it
65:02 to the stage walks up to the mic drops
65:05 one of the funniest jokes ever
65:07 I can't even repeat on the show but
65:09 everybody died he dropped the mic he had
65:12 he won he won this little contest we
65:14 were having and he's like I can go dark
65:17 you know I mean I can go blue or
65:18 whatever it is not dark just blue it was
65:21 a funniest joke but anyway so I'm
65:25 talking to him and I said you know we
65:26 need to get you back on stage man you
65:28 know I'm sorry I've been able to able to
65:30 help you in this last couple of years
65:32 and so we booked him at a little place
65:37 up in Hollywood it's a very very famous
65:40 place owned by another very famous
65:41 comedian but it's really an open mic
65:44 kind of thing and he's way above that
65:47 right but here he is a professional he's
65:50 a professional actor he's a professional
65:51 comedian and he's like you know I'm
65:53 gonna go to Jon Lovitz place I think he
65:56 still owns it it's on the Hollywood
65:59 Board Boardwalk thing up there in
66:00 Universal Studios and so we show up and
66:03 I bring my girlfriend he brings his wife
66:04 and we had a really good time and of
66:07 course all these kind of you know
66:08 up-and-coming rookie comedians are doing
66:11 a pretty damn good job and they're going
66:12 up there so he ends up going up and
66:15 taking a bullet really you know like
66:17 image wise for him to show up at that
66:18 venue would be like me you know I don't
66:21 know being a CEO of video game company
66:25 and that I'm serving your Wendy's next
66:26 rating is so for him it was sort of a
66:28 downgrade but he gets up there and he
66:30 kills it it's like a five-minute set
66:32 absolutely kills it he can do like two
66:34 hours if he needs to and so after that
66:37 he's like this felt good man he goes I'm
66:39 gonna come back here once a week I said
66:41 you sure and he's like yeah so fast
66:44 forward a couple years he's back on the
66:46 road he's killing it he's doing casinos
66:49 he's doing all kinds of wild venues man
66:51 in Vegas and other places
66:53 in LA in Hollywood here Indian
66:55 Reservation casinos and stuff and I'm
66:58 just giving you this example because
66:59 this is how you can change your life
67:01 this is sometimes what you need to do
67:02 sometimes that's what you need to hear
67:04 from other people but he had a vh1
67:07 special he's done a couple now and so we
67:12 all come to attend the special to be the
67:14 crowd it's a very tiny venue and so he
67:20 just before he starts this set he goes I
67:25 want to give a shout out that thinks
67:28 because of what that wasn't for this
67:30 person I wouldn't be on stage right now
67:31 and I'm like I wonder who this is right
67:33 and he points right at me and he goes
67:36 that dude right there he goes
67:38 weren't for him I I would have been
67:41 doing this other thing instead of doing
67:43 what I my god-given talent he goes what
67:45 he doesn't know is that my father told
67:47 me on my deathbed to get back on stage
67:49 and I didn't do it because a lot of my
67:51 comedy has to do with my mother and my
67:53 father and I wasn't capable of going on
67:56 stage and emotionally talking about my
67:57 father
67:58 and he keeps the jokes as if his
68:00 father's alive by the way I think it's
68:01 great I don't know if he still does that
68:04 today but he threw me this shout out and
68:07 it's like nothing in my entire life I've
68:09 ever I've ever experienced you know so
68:13 you can be that for somebody else and
68:14 you can get that from someone else to
68:17 get that motivation to get out there and
68:19 do it your if you're gonna do it to
68:22 someone else your EQ is gonna be a
68:23 really big thing to be empathetic but
68:26 how empathetic was it for him to throw
68:28 the shout out you know and and later
68:31 after the set was over and we got done
68:33 filming you know he's he's talking me
68:35 along in the party and and he's like
68:37 this is the guy this is the guy this guy
68:39 was sort of embarrassing but it was it
68:41 was flattering at the same time and so
68:45 to see him now
68:47 I think it's been jeez it must have been
68:50 six or seven years ago when this
68:52 occurred he is killing it now he hasn't
68:55 left the stage since he never he wasn't
68:58 gonna lose it like I've told you guys
68:59 several times in episodes when you're on
69:01 top do what you need to do to preserve
69:04 being on top don't hurt anybody else
69:06 don't
69:07 the eel don't step on ahead do what you
69:09 got to do to stay on top because it's
69:12 hard to get on top so I said I did an
69:15 episode on formal education obviously
69:20 doesn't get a lot of votes or a lot of
69:22 excuse me views because it's just like
69:24 what you already gonna talk about you go
69:27 and look at the comments in there you're
69:28 gonna hear a bunch of brilliant people
69:30 talking about their experience of like
69:32 yeah I didn't get the formal education
69:34 but this is what I've done boom boom
69:35 boom boom boom it's huge right it's huge
69:37 with some of these people done okay what
69:42 I think is probably the truth for all
69:45 the people that have had success outside
69:46 of formal education as their EQ is
69:48 extremely high especially people to
69:51 build their own businesses and their
69:53 employees love them
69:54 huge EQ they have it the self-awareness
69:59 self-management the motivation the
70:01 empathy and the social skills it all
70:04 comes together to give you a score as to
70:07 how well you're doing now I'm gonna give
70:10 you another perspective and this is just
70:11 simply me it's my assumption through my
70:19 empathetic abilities of what is
70:21 occurring we have obviously an explosion
70:26 of homelessness and the United States of
70:27 America Southern California is starting
70:30 to gain quite a few and this is way
70:34 before any sanctuary city ever arrives
70:37 were you know sanctuary cities in Los
70:40 Angeles used to be for the homeless and
70:41 now it's for all the illegals it's
70:44 interesting we have Skid Row down in LA
70:47 and it's one of the most you know it's
70:49 bizarre you go down there and it's been
70:51 that way for years and you'll walk down
70:53 the street and there are tons of
70:55 homeless people in tents you know
70:59 they've been dead that's where they live
71:00 they believed there for a very long time
71:01 sometimes people live down there for 20
71:03 years
71:04 they've never had a job and I always try
71:09 to look at them and feel what they're
71:11 feeling and try to gain a perspective
71:12 and there was unfortunately a crime that
71:17 occurred somewhere I think it was the
71:19 Bay Area I think
71:21 which is San Francisco for those of you
71:23 don't know there was a poor woman that
71:26 was murdered by a homeless guy and I he
71:31 chose he was a little insane for
71:35 whatever reason and I heard his court
71:38 case they they filmed it and I got to
71:41 see it somehow I don't know where the
71:42 hell I was in the world but I saw it and
71:45 he had this big long word which I don't
71:47 remember at the time but he said this is
71:49 the reason why I did what I did
71:51 and I think he was I mean here's the
71:55 thing he could have been wrong and he
71:58 could have been right about what
72:00 happened to him but we all run the risk
72:02 of doing what he said doesn't justify
72:05 anything that he did trust me but it is
72:08 something that we can do and as an
72:09 empathetic person to gain better social
72:11 skills especially in those extreme
72:13 circumstances where you're maybe in a
72:15 Skid Row situation we've got another
72:17 story about the Skid Row in LA but first
72:20 and foremost in the story line here he
72:23 used this word in the word meant that
72:25 someone was scoffing at him and his his
72:29 the word meant something like it's like
72:33 the person in the Bible who goes up and
72:35 prays to God at the Bible and starting
72:38 in the temple and he's praying out loud
72:41 and he says thank you Lord for giving me
72:43 all of the benefits you've given me all
72:45 the monies all the riches all the
72:46 intelligence all the opportunity
72:47 whatever but this last thing he said was
72:49 thank you for making me not like these
72:51 people in this room saying this out loud
72:54 I mean it's a fake situation but I'm
72:56 sure someone's done it in life right
72:58 that's generally what the word meant he
73:01 thought this woman walked by him and
73:02 scoffed at him at her superiority and
73:05 his lack of superiority he was obviously
73:09 in a great deal of pain emotionally and
73:12 so and I'm sure this festered in his
73:16 mind once he learned the word the
73:18 definition just like a magnet he was
73:20 seeing it everywhere whether it was real
73:23 or whether it was fake and instead of
73:26 verbally maybe yelling at her or
73:28 something and calling her out and have
73:30 been giving her a chance to
73:32 represent herself he went over and
73:36 killed her somehow
73:38 horrible situation and so when I first
73:43 saw that it moved me because I was like
73:46 Jesus am I doing that without even
73:49 thinking about it
73:50 am i putting off of vibe you know I
73:53 don't think I do I keep very very
73:55 monotone in those situations I don't try
73:58 to show any motion whatsoever when I'm
74:00 in the presence of people suffering
74:02 unless I know them or unless I'm helping
74:05 them and I show them my my sympathy and
74:08 empathy towards them of like okay we're
74:10 gonna get you worked out here don't
74:11 worry about it you know I could talk and
74:12 I can let them know my intent right
74:16 but I've rarely been in that situation
74:17 at that level right I haven't come up on
74:21 a car accident where I can help anybody
74:22 it's never happened to me the fast
74:25 forward probably I don't know 20 years
74:28 from when I saw that somewhere in that
74:30 range I had a girlfriend we're in LA
74:32 were with another couple
74:34 another amazing couple and we had just
74:37 seen a really bad musical it was so bad
74:40 but one of our friends was in the band
74:42 or whatever and so we went down to see
74:44 it and now it's down in downtown LA
74:49 right by the Skid Row so you had to walk
74:50 through Skid Row to get to the venue or
74:53 at least this place we ended up getting
74:56 drinks or something like that but then
74:57 we're walking back and it's pretty much
74:59 daytime the whole time and in fact this
75:02 is probably just prior to seeing the
75:03 actual musical and so we're walking and
75:07 you know the four of us look really good
75:11 I mean we're dressed up and everyone
75:13 looks really pretty and we came in nice
75:15 cars and all this good stuff and my
75:18 girlfriend at the time was saying
75:22 something sort of like she was just
75:26 literally being innocent and just kind
75:29 of going wow this is wild man this is
75:30 like she she lives in Hollywood she's
75:32 none you know new to LA or anything she
75:35 was just like man I haven't seen it like
75:37 this up close this much but she's
75:39 talking about it in complete earshot of
75:42 everybody down there and I know that I
75:45 don't have
75:46 of time and I can't form words fast
75:49 enough to explain to her you don't want
75:52 to be saying these things right now you
75:54 have no idea whether one of those guys
75:56 who's feeling scoffed at is listening
75:59 and he's literally on the edge of his
76:00 world you know hurts somebody because
76:04 he's just so pissed and so I kinda was
76:09 like and I don't want them to hear me
76:13 reply to her so I don't want to have
76:15 them hear me say you know we don't say
76:17 these you know the best thing I've
76:19 learned is not this a need this kind of
76:20 stuff while they can hear you I can't
76:22 say that I don't even remember what I
76:24 said but I was I got her to kind of be
76:26 quiet and she's not terribly into these
76:32 kind of deeper concepts she's a great
76:34 person but you know she didn't she
76:36 didn't really she's the innocent person
76:38 you know she was two years older than me
76:41 so she was no puppy puppy you know but
76:43 later on I said you know okay here's the
76:45 thing this is like her you gotta be
76:46 careful and she was just looking at me
76:48 like really you really think that was
76:50 gonna happen and I'm like yeah I think
76:52 it can happen man it's happened in in
76:54 lesser places than Skid Row in LA you
76:58 know that's sort of a digression in the
77:01 mental exercise of becoming empathetic
77:03 and extreme examples such that you can
77:05 bring it back to your own personal life
77:07 and lesser examples you know again mr.
77:10 Rogers Fred Rogers god bless the guy he
77:13 was Christ on earth I mean he was the
77:15 most pathetic person towards children
77:18 that I am aware of in this world in
77:22 world history
77:22 perhaps we can assume that many people
77:26 like him existed in this world but they
77:27 didn't get television shows they didn't
77:29 work for 36 years helping us love each
77:31 other but now Fred Fred's been gone
77:36 since 2003 god bless that man I'm going
77:42 to assume his EQ level is as high as
77:45 that little meter goes and I think that
77:47 that's a great goal for us to set so
77:52 that we may enjoy our own lives better
77:54 and better and better as a takeaway from
77:58 this episode
78:00 I want you to realize is that even if
78:03 the world was a perfect place which is
78:06 not EQ is something we need to manifest
78:11 it is literally a school of life you
78:14 will probably never have a class in
78:16 school unless we take over the world and
78:18 redo everything that's going to teach
78:20 you EQ you can read about it all you
78:23 want but in the end even if you have the
78:24 definition at the tip of your tongue you
78:26 can recite Wikipedia's definition or or
78:28 the books that have been written on the
78:30 subject
78:30 EW EQ you will have to do it yourself
78:34 and so this is going to be one of those
78:38 games you can play every single day to
78:40 have some fun
78:41 hopefully please understand that there
78:45 are movements and technologies and forms
78:48 of entertainment that are designed to
78:50 deprive you of your EQ growth and as
78:54 much as you might have it depends on how
78:56 old you are Stu whether or not you plan
78:58 on being a senator a president major
79:01 corporation participant a banker and
79:04 you're gonna use this skill of yours to
79:07 rebuild the world in a better place and
79:08 a better status right if you have
79:13 children or grandchildren or your round
79:14 kids for any reason you're a teacher you
79:17 don't have any of your own kids maybe
79:19 never want them that matter this is
79:21 something that they are gonna have to be
79:24 made aware of now what's happening is if
79:27 you read even the most basic definitions
79:30 of the stuff online look at the
79:32 criticisms of the eqe eye movement is
79:35 that they are trying to demonize this
79:37 registry because they don't want us to
79:41 they're trying to shame it is what
79:43 they're trying to do they don't want us
79:45 to be software so of course you know
79:48 academia which is probably largely made
79:51 out of super low EQ people are coming in
79:54 to [ __ ] on it because then they're still
79:55 okay don't notice that I have no empathy
79:58 don't notice that I'm not aware don't
80:00 notice that I can't manage manage my
80:02 life or motivate myself that I have no
80:05 social skills so I'm gonna demonize this
80:07 technology that's out there that helps
80:09 you become enlightened in this area
80:12 I'm gonna give you guys a silly little
80:14 analogy for those who want to listen to
80:16 the bonus track at the end of this
80:17 episode because this is a archetype of
80:20 what I think is going on in education in
80:22 this world and I think that this show
80:25 has a special place in people's hearts I
80:28 recently have been learning a bunch of
80:31 new Internet platforms very easy to
80:36 learn very you know straightforward
80:38 stuff using all the traditional language
80:40 languages that we knew with a couple new
80:41 ones but they're built off other
80:42 languages so whatever but now here's
80:44 what I have discovered in trying to
80:48 learn some of these new platforms I have
80:52 noticed that you'll go and view
80:54 tutorials great tutorials you can read
80:57 them online you can watch videos Vimy Oh
80:58 YouTube whatever and what they end up
81:01 doing is they keep showing you these
81:03 tutorials as if everything is going to
81:05 go right so you're typing and everything
81:08 they're typing in and they're expecting
81:09 everything to go right now after you
81:12 have everything set up on your computer
81:13 those tutorials work really well on
81:15 average but almost all these platforms
81:18 are an absolute nightmare to set up you
81:22 will do what they say and then
81:23 immediately where they go will see when
81:25 you reload the browser boom you see this
81:27 page and that means everything's set up
81:28 okay and you'll reload it in the lab of
81:29 500 error 502 or 419 error all these
81:34 errors that are going on you're like
81:35 what the hell and so you go out on what
81:38 is it dumb stackoverflow.com and you'll
81:42 start looking up all these answers or
81:43 these questions like look I'm having
81:45 this error and there will be thousands
81:47 of threats where people have run into
81:49 this problem if no one offers a solution
81:51 and you'll find a couple threads where
81:53 people have are offering what worked for
81:55 them and you try those steps and it
81:57 doesn't work and that's because these
81:59 are poorly engineered platforms or I
82:02 should say perhaps they were never meant
82:04 to work together and people are trying
82:06 to push them together but none of the
82:08 tutorials here's the thing I've got a
82:10 guy on Vimeo who is teaching me one
82:13 thing and he's amazing I mean this guy
82:15 talks about the errors and he shows you
82:17 the errors and he goes if you have this
82:18 this is what this is we have that one
82:20 this and he solves it perfectly it's
82:21 beautiful right
82:24 they don't talk to you about life as if
82:27 anything they're telling you will go
82:28 wrong just do this and it all works
82:31 really sometimes that works sometimes it
82:35 doesn't so one of the reasons why I
82:37 super digress from time to time into my
82:40 own personal life experiences so that
82:42 you can see how good intentions can go
82:45 awry but if you stick to it you can get
82:49 those good intentions to go right but
82:51 you just have to convince yourself and
82:52 anyone else that's involved in what
82:54 you're trying to do just stick to it
82:56 I spent a mine level of programming this
83:03 is astonishing to me okay I spent geez
83:08 seven days trying to get a particular
83:10 platform set up on my local computer
83:12 such that I could program on my Mac then
83:15 move the files over to my Windows
83:17 machine and if I take my Windows machine
83:18 out and do some programming at the
83:20 lounge or some other person's house I
83:22 can then migrate those back to my Mac
83:24 sounds pretty simple there's a million
83:26 technologies to make that happen I have
83:28 made millions and millions of dollars
83:31 worth of video games in these
83:32 environments and my companies where I
83:34 set them up personally said on my
83:35 engineers up we never had a hiccup but
83:38 technology is 15 years old now now the
83:41 copycat technologies were like well you
83:43 don't wanna use that that's bad use this
83:44 new technology it's good the new good
83:46 technology's got all these problems with
83:48 it where the old technology was perfect
83:52 it's interesting so please know that
83:56 there's a method to my madness when I'm
83:59 going through all these different
84:00 examples
84:01 hopefully it's entertaining as a story
84:04 and hopefully some of you have run into
84:06 some of these issues where you are being
84:08 told something and it it just doesn't
84:13 work but the other one I'll give you an
84:15 analogy for and all of you guys will
84:17 know this one is some of you ladies will
84:19 too how many times have you seen a self
84:22 defense course and I've used this in a
84:25 few episodes I don't know if I've
84:26 actually aired yet you have a self
84:28 defense course and again I've gone to
84:32 them I've watched them online I've had
84:35 personal ones with personal
84:36 people and they will give you the most
84:38 ridiculous attacks that people never do
84:41 in the real world and they give you the
84:43 most ridiculous attacks back so they'll
84:46 say the way you're being attacked
84:47 you know if someone you know I saw one
84:49 the other day where it was a it was
84:51 filmed in India and it was this woman in
84:53 one of those beautiful Indian dresses
84:55 and it was a guy grabbing her wrist so
84:59 grabbing her right wrist and she did
85:00 this move to get his hand off of her
85:02 wrist and I was like that's never gonna
85:05 happen right and there's there's videos
85:07 now there are compilations of sort of
85:10 fake martial arts right these guys that
85:12 have all these Chi weapons you know and
85:14 it's just all [ __ ] right but
85:17 self-defense I would say not necessarily
85:20 any particular martial art but
85:21 self-defense is an interesting thing
85:22 these people are running rackets selling
85:26 you false attacks and then you're
85:28 supposed to attack back in a way that is
85:30 so ludicrous that you would have to be
85:32 Bruce Lee or or some head MMA fighter
85:35 and you'd have to be six foot five to
85:38 make some of these things work you'd
85:39 have to be able rip a telephone book and
85:40 have to make some of these things work
85:42 and so you're getting fed a bunch of
85:44 crap that then eventually gives you
85:46 false sense of security so you get you
85:49 know you get yourself in a bad situation
85:50 and you get clocked you get raped you
85:53 get murdered you get kidnapped whatever
85:56 the amount of girlfriends I've taken
85:58 through self-defense courses is almost
86:00 unanimous saying look you know you need
86:04 to know some basic things okay I know
86:05 this seems like a one-in-a-billion
86:06 things never gonna happen but let me
86:08 tell you if it happens you're gonna be
86:09 so glad I talked to you like four or
86:10 five things to save your life even in
86:13 the most extreme circumstances some
86:14 people don't know how weapons work and
86:16 so they think if a guns pointed at them
86:19 they're completely you know at odds you
86:23 know of course we have [ __ ] now that
86:25 just running and shoot everybody and
86:26 then take ten dollars out of a register
86:28 unbelievable scumbags in this planet
86:31 anyway I think you feel me this is
86:35 something that is circling in my
86:36 personal life for a particular project
86:39 and I thought I would extend it out to
86:42 you guys for those of you who haven't
86:45 gone to deep thoughts radio.com the main
86:48 value is essentially all the links to
86:50 get
86:50 chose to go backwards in time and see
86:54 old shows I think YouTube quite frankly
86:56 is the very best way to get most of the
86:59 shows to figure out what you need the
87:02 podcasts will only give you I think 300
87:05 episodes back so it's not going to give
87:07 you the full podcast all the way back to
87:09 the beginning of time unless you run
87:12 your own podcast feed and you go off the
87:15 website but if you're coming in a video
87:16 you can go to audio so many audio you
87:18 can go to video if you like social
87:21 intercourse with other people like you
87:24 go to Facebook and click the Facebook
87:26 link and go in and apply again I ask you
87:28 one question say something human tonight
87:31 I had to one guy said something and one
87:34 housewife from India who said nothing
87:36 and joined four days ago and somehow
87:40 pops on to deep thoughts so block her
87:43 forever she'll never get into the site
87:45 sorry she's fake the other feed is
87:48 Twitter for those of you guys are big
87:51 Twitter fans I guess the best best thing
87:53 about Twitter is that there's a lot of
87:55 retweeting that people do so someone
87:57 might have a really hot Twitter page
88:00 refer one of the videos and we might
88:02 have ourselves a little subscription
88:04 extravaganza would that be nice there's
88:07 two ways to donate to the show there's
88:09 patreon calm
88:12 credit card or your bank account and
88:14 there's PayPal in case you just want to
88:17 throw some of money at the show it's
88:20 used to pay for cigars it's used to pay
88:24 for cameras and software and all kinds
88:26 of stuff I used to do this show and
88:27 again I would love to do this full time
88:30 and probably upgrade the show quite a
88:33 bit but that's not there as I watch
88:35 these channels get savagely turned off
88:39 by YouTube you know there we have to
88:42 keep in mind that there's a chance that
88:43 the show would be completely removed for
88:46 some reason today's May 1st
88:49 so whenever the show goes out that's
88:50 when this was recorded I am now able to
88:54 upload to [ __ ] shoot so the previous
88:57 upload barrier I was running into is
88:58 gone so now I'm putting the new remaster
89:01 season 1 up there and which means I got
89:04 a whole
89:04 and get the rest of those seasoned ones
89:07 updated I think I'm on at 45 right now
89:09 so I've got another 55 to remaster but
89:13 eventually those shows are gonna be
89:14 fully edited so I'm actually still
89:15 editing shows that don't have the
89:18 previous regimen of how to edit them so
89:20 I'm also much quicker at this and I'm
89:23 increasing my home bandwidth to three
89:25 hundred three hundred down so uploading
89:27 shows will go a hell of a lot faster
89:28 than it's been in the recent past
89:32 there's a whole new channel for season
89:34 one I'm just gonna give you a real quick
89:36 bumper on that they're remastered
89:37 they're the remastered in a way that
89:41 they can show in Europe they're also
89:43 remastered in terms of all the audio
89:44 levels most shows are going down by at
89:47 least five minutes and removing cigar
89:49 drags and sitting there thinking moments
89:52 you know that sort of thing so they're
89:54 much easier to digest than they ever
89:55 have been in the past in the end I will
89:58 re upload all of the podcast episodes
90:03 for season one so if you do come back
90:05 through podcasting you're gonna have
90:06 much better audio experience I still
90:08 haven't done that yet so I'm just on a
90:11 REM in a race to get the whole YouTube
90:13 thing done and then we'll be set we'll
90:16 have it all so if you are a [ __ ] shoot
90:18 fan right now it's in season one so it's
90:20 gonna take quite a while to get all
90:22 those up there again on the 6th of May I
90:25 get my new internet connection so that
90:27 will hugely speed up the reloading of
90:30 the episode and when I'm dropping them
90:33 on patreon for those of your patreon
90:34 fans they will upload a lot quicker so
90:38 when I post that hey I'm uploading this
90:40 episode right this very second you're
90:42 only gonna have about 5 to 10 minutes to
90:44 wait before it completely gets up there
90:47 probably around five minutes to be
90:49 honest and then you have to wait
90:50 whatever 45 minutes for it to encode
90:53 know that the videos are available in
90:55 360p initially if you're coming into a
90:58 brand new episode and it's low res just
91:00 hang in there if you don't want to watch
91:01 it in low res just give it give it about
91:04 12 hours and they'll get their 4k
91:07 version out there which is 2160p so
91:10 anyway that's all I got for you tonight
91:12 take care of yourself and someone else
91:14 I'll see in the next deep thoughts over
91:16 now
