00:14 so
00:19 [Music]
00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen
00:37 ah so i did an episode that i lost
00:41 i lost the video and i'm not quite sure
00:44 how that ever happens
00:46 it was uh probably a mistake on my part
00:48 of not labeling the video after
00:50 importing it because it gets a real
00:51 generic name
00:53 i thought i might redo that one today
00:55 but i'm not feeling that one today
00:58 i think it's time we get back into
00:59 dreams
01:02 because i've been having my typical
01:05 dreams
01:05 which are just so elaborate i mean it's
01:09 i don't know what to tell you guys it is
01:12 living another reality at night
01:15 um which isn't obviously this reality in
01:17 terms of its sensory input
01:20 but i've noticed a few things at least
01:22 about my dreams
01:24 and i would love to get your knowledge
01:27 on this and for those of you that dream
01:29 like me
01:29 or you dream every single night there's
01:32 just not a night you don't dream
01:34 i don't even remember a night that i
01:36 haven't dreamed
01:37 i don't know if that's ever occurred
01:39 even if it's just a teeny one or it's a
01:40 frustration one it's going in a loop and
01:42 it's frustrating
01:43 meaning it has no real context there's
01:45 no people in it you know
01:47 still a dream but that's really rare
01:51 but and i don't know what i'm going to
01:53 call this we'll see where it goes
01:56 the interesting thing is is that i do
01:58 review my dreams
02:01 after i wake up you know in my own head
02:02 i
02:04 i um i see you know what am i learning
02:06 about dreams you know
02:09 the episode on uh the ancient mind
02:13 really affected one of my perspectives
02:15 of dreams that i mentioned in the
02:17 episode
02:19 which has to do with the fact that
02:23 dreams are they have an interesting
02:27 proportional distribution of what you're
02:30 actually
02:30 experiencing in contrast to this reality
02:35 what do i mean i feel like dreams
02:38 are overwhelmingly an emotional
02:41 experience
02:44 whereas in this world it's very easy to
02:46 get into a mechanical
02:47 functional loop and not have an emotion
02:51 that is really discerning to your brain
02:54 right
02:55 so you're you're having an emotion but
02:57 it's
02:58 it's almost like a secondary thing
03:00 that's going on and you can
03:02 pretty much ignore it as much as you
03:03 want
03:06 and give an example you go to work and
03:07 you're typically typing on a keyboard
03:10 all day to process
03:11 people into forms or whatever or you're
03:15 you're building something and you just
03:17 need to kind of zone out
03:18 you need to just go i'm building a house
03:21 i am doing something
03:23 and you're paying attention to the
03:24 accuracy so you're much more
03:26 left-brained pretty much during your
03:29 work hours
03:31 you come home and you go for your vices
03:34 because we get hungry at least twice a
03:36 day that's one of your little vices
03:39 typically you don't want to eat food you
03:40 don't like and so you get into an
03:41 emotional spin with that but still it's
03:44 it's very short-lived you're in and out
03:47 of that emotion oh there's the food i
03:49 like
03:50 that tastes great okay now i'm gonna go
03:51 home and i feel good
03:53 and it's sort of a it's a low brow
03:56 spectrum of what we could be feeling as
03:59 compared to more
04:00 incredible events like i just met the
04:02 most amazing person in the world i just
04:04 got the job of my dreams
04:06 i got the call it's my break in
04:08 hollywood or whatever it is right
04:11 those are your super emotional highs
04:15 what i have discovered in dreams is that
04:19 as
04:19 all the action is occurring i'm at
04:22 let's just say for the sake of guessing
04:27 having about a 60 emotional experience
04:29 and a 40
04:30 mechanical experience it makes sense
04:34 i'm not in this world i am not really
04:36 with my body
04:38 as much as i feel like i'm with my body
04:41 we talk about this a lot right you don't
04:43 really have any arms or legs
04:45 if you do happen to see your arms in
04:48 your
04:49 dream or your legs i've had my legs in a
04:51 dream once when i was
04:53 in third grade i dreamed i was at
04:57 grade school which was out in the
04:59 country
05:00 and um gotta hear a road here here
05:04 and there was a lion in the room with me
05:09 and he was pretty peacefully sitting
05:10 there it was a full-grown male lion with
05:12 big mane
05:14 and he reached up and took a chunk out
05:16 of my leg
05:17 and i immediately woke up and i don't
05:20 know if i actually felt it there was no
05:22 blood or anything like that i was in
05:23 third grade
05:24 you know plus i hadn't watched a bunch
05:25 of gory movies at that point
05:28 by hands i've got tons of dreams with
05:31 clapping
05:33 applause writing down a phone number
05:36 but man unless there is something that's
05:38 very specific to my limbs
05:41 i don't remember seeing my legs in a
05:44 dream for
05:45 well pretty much since they're great i
05:46 don't have a memory
05:48 of that i do have obviously i'm walking
05:50 around a lot i'm operating
05:52 a car but i'm not really seeing my legs
05:54 these things are just occurring because
05:56 my mind is willing it to happen because
05:58 that's the scenario get in car drive car
06:01 but i never remember hitting a gas pedal
06:03 a brake pedal
06:04 i don't remember putting a car in drive
06:06 or anything like that
06:08 i just get in the car i i do remember
06:10 holding a steering wheel i think
06:12 for sure several times but the other one
06:15 that's
06:16 the new epiphany for this episode i
06:19 don't think it's strong enough to make
06:20 an entire episode because i'm just going
06:21 to tell you and
06:22 you can go look at your dreams
06:26 my goal of making these episodes besides
06:29 just
06:30 entertaining you guys with discussion
06:33 as i really would love for those of you
06:35 who are chronic dreamers
06:37 to take this information and
06:41 um see if this applies to your
06:44 experiences as well because if you're
06:45 having completely different experiences
06:48 that's major information to me i need to
06:51 interview my father because
06:53 he recently watched the episode with
06:56 that stick i smoked
06:57 he's going to be seeing a new one and he
06:59 mentioned something about dreams
07:01 and he texts me back and he goes uh
07:04 you're
07:04 just like me i have dreams every single
07:06 night and they're amazing and i remember
07:08 my entire lifetime even
07:12 when i was a kid i don't remember i was
07:13 about eight to ten somewhere in there my
07:15 father
07:16 was walking in the room i don't know
07:18 what spawned the conversation but he
07:20 goes
07:21 they say you don't dream in color which
07:24 i've never heard anyone say that
07:26 before or since and he goes but i dream
07:29 in full technicolor
07:31 and i'm like yeah you know i guess i do
07:33 too i just never knew that anyone ever
07:35 had that insinuation that you don't
07:39 and what's interesting is some of those
07:41 senses aren't important in dreams
07:43 that's the other really interesting
07:44 thing well
07:46 do you dream in color well just have a
07:48 dream and see if you dream of color
07:50 like off the bat the one i'm thinking of
07:51 right now is i was
07:54 i feel like i was in india or something
07:59 and i was in this little sort of
08:02 makeshift home
08:03 it was like it was made of cement but it
08:06 had a beautiful opening to the ocean
08:08 and a big probably about
08:12 i'd say 15-foot wave of really gentle
08:14 water
08:16 went over the house and the roof was
08:18 open it was like this courtyard
08:20 sort of thing but the weather was like
08:23 perfect in my dream and it was like a
08:24 summer
08:26 evening it was nice the sun was still
08:28 out it's probably like if you're in
08:30 the summer solstice where depending on
08:33 where you are in the world the sun can
08:34 go down in the
08:35 nine o'clock region this would have been
08:37 about
08:38 seven or eight o'clock so really nice
08:40 you know
08:42 but i remember looking at that wave and
08:43 it was just as blue as
08:45 you know the cleanest water and so that
08:48 that's the one i remember off top of my
08:50 head with that but
08:52 the one thing i have discovered is that
08:56 i think this yearns back to the
08:58 mechanism that's causing these dreams
09:01 is that i don't stay stationary
09:05 for long in a dream i'm
09:08 always moving through a dream
09:12 i had a dream the other day that really
09:13 shook this into my head and i was
09:15 realizing that
09:16 wherever i am i'm always on the move
09:20 it's the strangest thing again you know
09:23 my dreams
09:23 they you know they're always structures
09:26 there's homes
09:27 skyscrapers concert halls
09:31 theaters quaint little homes
09:35 and i'm always moving around because
09:36 it's almost like my brain is
09:38 almost lucid you know it's looking at
09:40 this experience going get it baby get it
09:42 because as soon as you wake up you'll
09:44 never see this world again perhaps
09:46 outside of again those few places that i
09:48 dream
09:50 regularly i guess throughout a it
09:53 probably takes a decade to rotate
09:54 through
09:55 all of the places that i i know i've
09:59 been through several times
10:01 i wish i had the time to render some of
10:02 these places in
10:04 in blender and show you my dreams you
10:06 know
10:08 the one i thought about trying to model
10:10 was the art deco
10:12 theater where what's funny about it is i
10:15 have a feeling it's a movie theater but
10:18 it's like 1930s
10:21 sort of mid-century atomic era
10:24 building and it's it's i'm outside the
10:28 building
10:29 initially it's really big it's like a
10:31 big
10:32 sort of sound stagey kind of sized
10:35 building but it's got this
10:37 just beautiful like deep green
10:40 well maybe like even a washed out green
10:42 um
10:43 kind of 50s diner looking art decoy kind
10:46 of thing
10:48 and i go inside and there's a gigantic
10:51 escalator i just mentioned this
10:52 and i go up the escalator and the
10:54 escalator actually turns the corner and
10:55 goes up without losing its
10:57 mechanical i mean you don't walk off
11:00 into a blank area and then get on a
11:02 different one
11:03 which that for me blows me but here's
11:04 the funny thing even though i'm pretty
11:06 sure
11:07 getting to that top floor which must be
11:09 three stories up
11:10 because the first escalator is at least
11:12 two stories
11:14 i don't remember going into that into a
11:16 movie theater at that location the dream
11:18 kind of ends at that point but i'm in
11:20 such architectural heaven
11:23 seeing this location that's really what
11:25 it's about for me
11:27 but it is true i don't hold still much
11:31 now i do have a couple moments where i
11:33 have
11:35 paused in a dream and it's it's always
11:39 with a goal in mind to stop
11:42 it's and it's some it's usually spawned
11:43 by someone else usually there's one
11:46 where it
11:47 isn't that way the two that come to mind
11:50 just so you can kind of compare notes is
11:53 when a
11:53 family this is what i learned i didn't
11:55 have hands
11:56 really it's a dream i talked about in
11:58 the past where
12:00 i was with this family nuclear family
12:03 man boy girl
12:04 mom dad it's an art studio inside this
12:07 home
12:08 but it is bitching man big old island
12:10 with all kinds of supplies on it
12:12 the outside of the room walls were all
12:15 storage you know open-faced storage
12:17 containers with everything you'd want
12:19 paper and
12:20 paint and whatever pens it was just
12:22 beautiful
12:24 and we were messing around together in
12:26 this room
12:27 which sort of was a backstory like i
12:29 entered this
12:30 phase of the dream and it was like we've
12:32 had a good time i don't remember
12:34 having the good time but i really felt
12:35 good again 60
12:37 emotion 40 execution
12:40 it might even be higher in the emotional
12:42 realm but they said let's get your phone
12:44 number
12:44 so we can call you let's do this again i
12:46 was like yeah and i've got a
12:48 pin and the whole family's around me and
12:51 i'm trying to write my phone number and
12:53 when i
12:54 i bumped into that comedian that's got
12:56 cerebral palsy
12:58 i forget his name off the top of my head
13:00 here
13:03 it's it's uh he's really famous right
13:05 now but the weird thing is most of his
13:06 bits on youtube are about 10 years old
13:08 but he's one of the funniest guys on one
13:10 he talked about when he's at a club
13:12 and if someone asks a girl asked him for
13:14 his phone number before he got married
13:16 he said oh oh you want my number and he
13:18 can't control his hands that well right
13:20 and one of his hands is
13:21 one of those turned hands he's got a lot
13:23 of funny jokes about that
13:25 he's got some brilliant jokes about this
13:28 i'll put his image up on the video so
13:31 you guys can see his stuff
13:34 but he talks about how he goes okay let
13:36 me get some sheets of paper
13:38 and what his joke is is that he can't
13:40 control his hands enough so every number
13:42 he's writing
13:44 is huge because that's the only way he
13:45 can write on a piece of paper
13:48 you can't drive you know and he's so he
13:50 talks about all his disabilities and
13:52 he's just a brilliant guy
13:54 but he goes okay here's he goes like he
13:56 goes 13 hours later i'm like here's my
13:58 phone number he goes don't mix them up
14:01 because they're all in the order of his
14:02 phone number anyway
14:04 that's sort of what it felt like my my
14:07 hands were spaghetti i couldn't control
14:09 them
14:09 and that's when i had that huge epiphany
14:11 that i don't really control my hands the
14:16 most recent one
14:16 is just realizing that i'm always moving
14:20 and i don't quite understand that other
14:24 than
14:25 the dream machine inside my brain is
14:28 constantly refreshing
14:29 incoming data and translating that into
14:33 a dream so now
14:36 what i want to suggest here
14:40 and i always like to get the mechanism
14:42 of what dreams are because there are
14:45 if you have a decent dream it's sort of
14:48 heavenly
14:50 nothing's bad no matter how bad things
14:53 get
14:54 you know they resolve themselves even if
14:56 you have that uh
14:57 there's two dreams that i think men have
15:00 and women
15:01 ladies if you could please let me know
15:03 if you have something of this
15:05 similar caliber there's one i think you
15:07 guys have with us
15:10 it's just a human thing i don't mean to
15:11 be exclusive we're not gifting you it
15:14 we're all having it because we're humans
15:16 but the one is that you walk into a room
15:19 or you materialize in a room and you're
15:21 naked
15:22 and you get embarrassed and this is
15:23 typically a dream you have when you're
15:25 younger because as you get older
15:27 you can care less if anybody sees you
15:28 naked you just don't care
15:32 but my my explanation in previous
15:34 episodes for those who haven't seen any
15:36 of those episodes
15:37 if you dig dream analysis we've got a
15:39 good playlist
15:41 i apologize to those of you on bid shoot
15:43 because
15:45 there's no real easy way to create
15:47 playlists there are but they start
15:48 interfering with you viewing the channel
15:50 and i just gave up on that whole process
15:54 but i think that you're materializing
15:55 your body
15:58 and then you materialize your clothes on
16:00 your body if you care about such a thing
16:02 i don't think you care about your body
16:04 much which is why this doesn't happen
16:06 that often but i think as we're younger
16:09 and we're you know you grow up with
16:12 just an almost innate concept of privacy
16:15 for your
16:16 your nakedness you know we've got the
16:18 old eve
16:20 garden of eden sin in our brain or
16:22 whatever the hell the thing is
16:25 you metabolize your body first in the
16:27 dream because you care
16:29 you're making it because you care but
16:32 then you
16:33 haven't put the clothes on yet because
16:35 you don't normally meta you don't
16:37 make your body happen that often where
16:39 you think it's visible
16:41 it's not a conscious thought and a dream
16:43 but you can see me right well whatever
16:45 i don't remember any fashion in my
16:47 dreams not once do i remember
16:50 i got my leather jacket on i got this
16:51 you know i got shorts on nope
16:54 but then someone sees you before you put
16:56 your clothes on
16:57 in the dream because you're making
16:59 everything happen you're the engineer in
17:00 this
17:01 art of dreams somehow capable of
17:04 rendering everything in perfect 3d it's
17:05 amazing
17:06 dreams are fascinating things for me
17:10 so that's one the naked dream it's been
17:13 dramatized in tons of sitcoms star trek
17:15 did one
17:17 but the second one that men have i know
17:20 never heard this from a woman but i'm
17:22 sure it happens is you
17:24 arrive at a location in your car you
17:26 park it in a parking
17:28 space you go inside a building or a
17:31 house
17:32 something you have a conversation then
17:35 you come back out to your car and it's
17:36 missing
17:38 why because just like a video game
17:40 you're throwing away the level that you
17:42 wrote
17:42 just a second ago to like free up memory
17:44 or something it's kind of what it is and
17:45 so you don't
17:47 fully reconstruct your car
17:50 what's interesting about this phenomenon
17:52 just like naked
17:53 dreams where i don't have that anymore
17:55 if i thought i was naked i'd be like
17:58 you're gonna borrow a pair of pants you
17:59 know whatever i wouldn't care
18:02 i no longer have that weird fear
18:06 that my car's gonna disappear you know
18:08 in this world it's like okay i'll call
18:09 an insurance company and pay a grant and
18:11 i'll get
18:12 all the money back for the car's value
18:13 if it gets captured then
18:15 i get money out of the person who stole
18:16 it or whatever i just don't care
18:18 you know but let's go over to
18:21 a drug called lsd
18:25 and just as a small digression about lsd
18:29 you know i've taken it three times it is
18:31 not something you would ever be able to
18:33 abuse in my opinion i have heard people
18:35 microdose the stuff
18:36 then i heard it's almost impossible to
18:39 get real stuff anymore
18:41 it's such an amazing experience
18:44 but it comes with a lot of requirements
18:46 and this is all going to factor back
18:48 into dream
18:49 production in my opinion or it might
18:53 my buddy who had taken thousands of
18:56 trips in the 70s
18:57 60s and 70s he met me in 2006
19:02 and it wasn't until probably
19:06 gosh 2016 or something that he 10 years
19:08 later
19:10 that he kept telling me he was like we
19:12 gotta we gotta go on a trip we gotta
19:13 become mud brothers
19:15 and i said i'm in man and he goes i
19:17 gotta make sure
19:19 that you don't have any like weird
19:21 anxieties um
19:23 that you don't have any weird um
19:26 skeletons in your closet because as soon
19:29 as you go on this drug he says
19:30 all those barriers that you use to hold
19:32 back all that
19:33 secret stuff about yourself they're to
19:37 come down 100
19:38 whatever you are inside that's your trip
19:42 and over 10 years and tons of
19:44 experiences he
19:45 finally decided okay i'm going to get
19:47 some of this stuff
19:48 and um we're going to take it and he was
19:51 100 right
19:53 now he had taken tons of mushrooms as
19:54 well which again i haven't been able to
19:56 get a mushroom to
19:57 do much at all i've eaten
20:00 damn near a pint of mushrooms all at
20:03 once
20:03 i've got some recent advice about how to
20:05 take that if i ever find anymore
20:07 they're rumoring to make that legal in
20:09 california
20:11 but so i asked him i said okay what's
20:12 the difference between mushrooms and
20:13 acid
20:15 he said mushrooms just do what they do
20:17 no matter what
20:19 if you're gonna have a hallucination
20:20 you're gonna have that most of the time
20:22 it's just a really
20:23 peaceful feeling you get very
20:26 existential with your brain
20:27 which is something that at least in lsd
20:30 i can claim that you get to have that
20:33 memory for the rest of your life the i
20:35 have no experience
20:37 having anything with mushrooms of course
20:38 so but here's the way i always describe
20:40 lsd
20:40 trips if you were to
20:44 smoke the most amazing indic or not
20:47 sativa
20:49 weed which i've done and
20:52 you get these pretty amazing epiphanies
20:54 i've done sketches and designs and
20:56 man just some amazing stuff unless i
20:59 write it down
21:00 all those great ideas vanish like a
21:02 dream when you wake up you get them for
21:04 a few seconds
21:05 and then they're gone so that sucks
21:08 because you'll have some really good
21:09 ideas
21:11 lsd what you see
21:14 is what you get to keep if i
21:17 had you come to los angeles and i take
21:19 you to
21:21 moca some interesting art gallery or
21:24 some experience
21:27 you want to see all the homeless people
21:28 on a hollywood boulevard dress like
21:30 superman
21:31 you're going to remember that when you
21:32 go home someone's going to say what was
21:34 your trip like and he oh my god he took
21:36 me this place i saw his wild painting
21:37 and da da da da
21:38 and you're going to remember it 100 to
21:41 the best of your ability
21:42 just like a real experience and lsd for
21:45 me
21:46 gives me experiences that i remember a
21:48 thousand percent
21:49 it's bizarre i can still just close my
21:51 eyes and see
21:53 the artwork that i saw and your first
21:56 trip is always
21:57 your most amazing trip the regiment i
22:00 had
22:01 again to complete the digression is i
22:04 took it it took me about an hour to feel
22:05 anything crawling up my back it was like
22:07 this warm liquid crawling up my back and
22:11 then i started to see kind of all the
22:12 patterns in the room kind of jiggle
22:15 wasn't hallucination it's just the way
22:16 that it interferes with the way you
22:17 process your visual data
22:20 but my buddy goes okay lie down on the
22:21 sofa he's in another room
22:24 doing other things he goes lie down and
22:26 close your eyes
22:27 he goes you're going to see amazing
22:28 things and sure enough i closed my eyes
22:31 and man if i could have stayed on that
22:32 sofa all day
22:34 i would have it was just you know again
22:36 i saw this graffiti and
22:38 wild artwork and man it was it was just
22:41 fun i drew it all
22:44 i was able to draw it a week later to
22:46 give you a perspective of how
22:47 how much of an imprint this was but the
22:50 main thing he told me
22:52 was that he goes everything that's
22:53 happening around you is is getting
22:55 involved with what you see
22:57 and he's playing beautiful music in the
22:59 other room and i just gave this uh story
23:00 the other day so i apologize for the
23:02 repeat
23:03 but he's playing a bunch of beautiful
23:05 kind of new age stuff and it's just
23:06 controlling what i'm seeing
23:08 it's so amazing and then some gangster
23:10 rap came on and oh my god what i was
23:12 seeing just turned into like
23:13 evil and he runs in the office and he
23:16 goes oh sorry man he kicks it back to
23:17 the other track
23:20 and everything cleaned up
23:23 so the mechanism is he said you know if
23:27 a
23:27 motorcycle drives by the house and it's
23:30 blasting its pipes
23:31 that will interfere with what you see
23:34 because that's why a lot of people like
23:35 to do it nature
23:36 you're surrounded by trees and it's just
23:38 peaceful and then you really get a
23:40 good glimpse of god's soul
23:43 and those experiences but it also
23:45 creates amazing connections for you
23:48 which i had two people explained that to
23:49 me before i took it
23:52 and it was like they said everything
23:53 that you think will connect together
23:55 like that show connections
23:57 and you'll see correlations that are
23:59 just absolutely beautiful
24:02 and so when they when i took it
24:06 you know major connections i took the
24:07 second dose in this house
24:10 i took six tabs all by myself and it was
24:14 amazing still about 45 minutes to start
24:16 but man i just sat here and meditated
24:18 man i didn't have uh the show of course
24:21 i recorded a ton of audio of me talking
24:23 and the second trip i took a bunch of
24:25 video
24:26 but i weighed about 20 pounds more so
24:27 you'll never see that video
24:30 i did think about crawling through some
24:32 of the audio and trying to
24:34 gift you guys with some of that uh
24:36 analysis but i have to listen to it and
24:38 see what it says
24:40 but they're absolutely correct you make
24:41 these huge connections
24:45 now go back to dreams
24:48 why are we always moving why are dreams
24:50 so nebulous
24:51 in their form you can spend some time in
24:55 a room
24:56 and you know if like i've i've had
24:58 several dreams or in an amp
25:00 amphitheater either anticipating a movie
25:03 about to play
25:05 or uh i've had joan rivers perform in my
25:08 dreams
25:09 i've had prince dreams several of them
25:12 where he and i are like buddies and i'm
25:13 helping setting up the stage i'm at his
25:14 house and all this other stuff
25:17 but the second i turn around and look
25:18 one way and concentrate and have an
25:20 experience that way and then i turn and
25:22 look at the other way
25:23 and then i turn back that other room has
25:25 reconfigured a little bit
25:26 if not completely changed
25:30 and your mind doesn't seem to care
25:31 that's what the weird thing is all the
25:33 discerning circuits in your mind that
25:34 would say
25:35 my god what's going on with reality you
25:36 know you don't care in a dream do you
25:40 you don't freak out if the room changes
25:42 but the people who teach you how to
25:43 dream lucidly
25:45 that's their mechanism they say build up
25:47 a habit while you're awake
25:49 to read a phone number
25:52 look away and then we'll read anything
25:55 to be honest
25:56 i look away and look back obviously in
25:58 this reality you'll be the same
26:00 pull that trick in a dream it will
26:02 change right in front of you and the
26:03 more that you have this
26:05 habit you'll notice and you'll go into
26:08 lucid mode so imagine i'm
26:11 sleeping and you know when i do this
26:13 episode
26:14 i try to cancel out all the ambient
26:16 sounds that are just annoying to the
26:17 soundtrack
26:19 but you'll hear cars drive by when i do
26:21 during the day
26:22 birds will whistle and you just hear
26:25 sounds
26:26 well if i was tripping on lsd all those
26:28 sounds would
26:30 influence my feeling my connections
26:33 if i was laying down trying to see
26:35 things which by the way on my second
26:37 trip i tried to lay down and see that
26:38 stuff again
26:39 nothing so again your first trip you'll
26:43 you want to covet it because it is very
26:46 unique and that's exactly what i was
26:47 told what happened and that's exactly
26:49 what happened i took my third trip
26:51 with my buddy at his house again we
26:53 recreated everything
26:55 and it was very subtle but it was a very
26:57 powerful dose
26:58 it hit us in 30 minutes which was
27:02 twice as fast as the other one so you
27:04 could feel it i mean he and i are
27:05 looking at each other
27:06 and he he hadn't taken any major
27:09 dose in decades and he just looks at me
27:11 and he's like wow this is some powerful
27:12 stuff i'm like yeah
27:14 like can you feel it yeah oh my god but
27:17 we had already
27:17 started manhandling the drug because we
27:20 had done it
27:21 a couple years before now what if you're
27:24 lying down in your bed and
27:28 obviously when you're in your dream
27:30 you're not necessarily
27:31 changing sides you're not rolling around
27:33 like i sleep on my side
27:35 and but my my suspicion now
27:39 is that maybe well here's here's the
27:43 conflict
27:43 i'm stationary in bed my dreams are
27:46 constantly moving
27:48 they are no matter if i'm still
27:50 something's moving
27:52 could it be that the sensory input and
27:55 kind of sort of chaotic electricity that
27:57 i'm
27:57 processing is um
28:02 affecting the fact that i can't hang on
28:05 to something
28:06 now if we kick down to the soul
28:08 participating in this because you're
28:10 essentially freeing yourself
28:11 up from your body
28:15 and again i just this just recently
28:17 occurred to me and it's just a fun
28:18 little
28:19 analogy maybe it's literally true maybe
28:21 it's not
28:22 you've seen a human brain it's a bunch
28:24 of tubes
28:26 uh the brain in an octopus is a single
28:29 tube
28:30 about the size your pinky if it's a
28:32 50-foot squid you know
28:36 this could be the ethereal passage or
28:40 the soul passage
28:41 of your soul it's like a crazy straw
28:44 you know it's going through that those
28:46 tubes and it's participating in the
28:48 various quadrants of your brain that
28:49 handle your hands and your
28:52 memory but i think your memory is not in
28:53 your brain i think it's way outside the
28:55 game
28:56 yes you can pop a head open touch on the
28:58 brain and it will give you memories and
29:00 all kinds of stuff if you start getting
29:01 see now
29:03 a very common trait is old people
29:06 remember events like it was
29:07 just two seconds ago that happened
29:10 potentially gosh
29:12 the one i knew was a 93 year old woman
29:15 who was having a dream
29:17 of or having a a recall i should say
29:20 of having went to san francisco
29:22 california
29:23 which none of us knew she went there and
29:26 she had a margarita
29:28 and this woman was in kansas in my
29:31 little hometown
29:32 for the majority of her entire life she
29:35 never got married she stayed with her
29:36 sister
29:38 which is how i know her because her
29:39 sister's a grandmother of a friend of
29:40 mine
29:43 and we just thought that was fascinating
29:44 that she got this little
29:47 dream back or this this sorry i
29:49 shouldn't say dream her real event back
29:52 because someone didn't have confirmed
29:53 that she actually took a trip out there
29:55 once
29:56 i will tell you this if you ever have a
29:58 relative do something like that
29:59 especially an event that you didn't know
30:01 occurred
30:02 and they start waxing poetic about it
30:04 get in there and talk to them
30:06 treat them as if the event just occurred
30:08 and interview them
30:10 well what are you doing there you know
30:11 what what did you do today in san
30:13 francisco and
30:14 get them to bring it all back man it's
30:15 like a time capsule from the past you
30:17 know
30:19 i understand why folks that have this
30:21 randomly sprung on them
30:22 don't do that because it's such a such a
30:24 bizarre shocking
30:26 thing that occurs it's fun as it is but
30:29 imagine we are
30:30 like i said you know we are in my
30:32 opinion we're ethereal beings
30:34 we have our molecular structure
30:36 literally renewed
30:39 at potentially 50 times the speed of
30:40 light
30:42 because that's the speed of ether and so
30:45 even though we look at our cigar and
30:48 it's right there and it's not changing
30:50 it's actually being renewed like a
30:54 a collection of forces that hold it all
30:57 together
30:58 we can't sense ether easily because we
31:01 don't choose to believe it exists
31:03 anymore because of an idiot named
31:04 einstein who never invented anything in
31:06 this entire world
31:09 and not even the photoelectric effect he
31:11 was thrown on with the nobel prize some
31:12 other dudes made it and stuck him on
31:14 there so they could get the prize and
31:15 get the money
31:16 he was all about money so that's his
31:18 thing if you go back to tesla or anyone
31:20 before him
31:21 this stuff exists they're the smarter
31:23 group of people with hundreds of patents
31:25 and hundreds of inventions we use every
31:26 day to make this show possible
31:29 and this is where this happens so if we
31:32 are
31:33 at a subatomic level constantly being
31:36 renewed
31:37 the milliamps that we use to survive on
31:40 a daily basis
31:41 even when you're dreaming as i always
31:44 say why do we dream why do or
31:45 sorry why do we go to sleep every single
31:47 day i mean
31:49 irrespective of drugs that might keep
31:50 you up for days and days
31:53 if you're healthy why do you have to go
31:54 to sleep every day
31:56 if you didn't do much today you didn't
31:58 exert yourself you just chose to stay
32:00 in bed all day you didn't even use your
32:02 body and let's just say
32:03 you didn't play a video game you didn't
32:05 watch any complex shows on netflix you
32:07 can use your brain either
32:09 can't you skip a day of sleep i mean
32:12 what is your body healing from
32:14 just having your eyes open because
32:16 that's about the only thing that's
32:17 happening
32:18 maybe get dry eyes you know that happens
32:20 when you get really stay up really late
32:22 your eyes start watering
32:24 but let's just say you stay in bed and
32:26 you keep your eyes closed for the most
32:27 the time but you're just literally
32:28 conducting a
32:30 mental experiment you'll still have that
32:33 bio feedback rhythm that is telling you
32:37 it's time to go to bed
32:40 like your body's on a chemical cycle
32:43 even when you're asleep though well
32:47 how functional is your body when you're
32:48 asleep does your heart stop pumping
32:51 no everything keeps going
32:55 there's not a single part of your body
32:57 when you're asleep where your arteries
32:58 aren't
32:59 throwing cells around it's
33:02 it's constant so if you think of your
33:05 body as a constantly moving
33:07 architecture both at the macro level and
33:10 the micro level
33:12 but your dreams are potentially
33:16 either in this consciousness cloud that
33:19 is we call the mind
33:21 between the body and the soul but if you
33:24 don't have
33:25 if it takes two things to make your
33:28 consciousness
33:31 then you look at the body and you're
33:34 like well it's never
33:35 slowing down the electrical circuits are
33:38 constantly firing
33:40 look over here at your soul and you're
33:41 like well there's a good reason why it
33:43 would be in a
33:45 in a cycle of some sort it's a living
33:48 thing
33:48 living things have cycles why do we
33:50 think rocks aren't alive but plants
33:52 are those plants are cycling all their
33:55 their innards
33:56 photosynthesizing absorbing nutrients
33:58 from the ground
34:00 going through its budding process let's
34:02 just say all the fibonacci pattern
34:05 dictation your fibonacci patterns and
34:07 all things
34:08 because it is an i mean a plant is
34:11 basically a construct
34:13 a direct construct of ethereal winds so
34:16 i looked down in a succulent plant some
34:18 cactus or something and the thorns on
34:20 them
34:21 on the stock of a flower those thorns
34:24 are coming out in a perfect spiral
34:26 all the way down
34:29 why does anything have a thorn why does
34:31 it have a petal
34:33 because that is where the ether has
34:35 found a
34:36 a weak spot in the crystallization of
34:40 the stem
34:42 or the end of a stem which might be
34:43 creating again another three-dimensional
34:46 beautiful thing because even the bottom
34:48 of a bud that's about to turn into a
34:50 rose
34:51 it's all configured in there in a
34:52 fibonacci pattern the only thing you
34:53 haven't seen is it
34:55 blasting out the ether winds turning
34:57 into these individual
35:00 petals that then do their thing until
35:02 they
35:03 they get so exhausted of being that they
35:06 wither away
35:07 that's why everything is a life cycle so
35:10 it would be safe to assume i think that
35:12 if we have a soul
35:13 which i'm pretty damn convinced we do
35:15 again not religious
35:17 just your intelligence cloud in the
35:19 universe made of something that is not
35:21 detectable by machines therefore
35:23 scientists who poo it away because
35:27 scientists want you to believe they know
35:29 everything
35:30 it's a strange thing you know and just
35:33 to
35:33 digress on that little mechanism for a
35:35 split second because i think it's
35:36 important
35:38 to understand the psychology of your
35:41 average scientist
35:43 there had to have been a point in time
35:44 where society was starting to
35:47 crumble due to consciousness levels
35:51 increasing and therefore
35:54 well the word we love to use is
35:56 enlightenment which means to see more
35:58 so society is seeing more on a
36:02 minute-by-minute basis they're freaked
36:04 out about stuff
36:05 and so you know wise old men
36:09 wise old women in equal proportions
36:12 are solving different aspects of reality
36:15 for us right
36:16 there's old wife's tales you know that's
36:18 the female
36:19 sort of cliche for old old-time wisdom
36:22 coming out of females and males had
36:24 their i don't know what you call it
36:26 some old anecdote tale whatever
36:30 but they're probably looking at it from
36:31 the standpoint of hey man don't worry i
36:33 mean i
36:34 let's say i'm an 80 year old guy and i'm
36:36 in
36:38 egypt or or greece or someplace
36:41 probably more like babylonia mesopotamia
36:44 that kind of place where it's it's been
36:47 it's very primitive still
36:50 in some aspects and we're we've lived
36:53 through
36:54 all these eras where young people are
36:55 suddenly starting to panic about
36:57 something
36:58 and we're like oh that's weird i see
37:01 what you're seeing you know and i see
37:02 that you have a curiosity but you're
37:04 also translating that curiosity into
37:06 fear
37:07 and so i have to convince you that it's
37:10 not something
37:11 you need to fear now probably in
37:14 a lot of cases in the earlier days these
37:17 were really empirical pieces of truth
37:19 that were given to the youth to calm
37:20 them down say hey look at this this is
37:22 [ __ ] this is chinola you know don't
37:23 worry about it right
37:24 and they calmed the population down thus
37:28 returning it back to its productive
37:31 iterations and cycles to exist
37:34 as we have progressed
37:38 those questions and the enlightenment to
37:41 ask
37:41 more complex questions and then to have
37:44 these weird imploding moments of
37:46 consciousness where you're saying oh my
37:47 god
37:48 where did we come from how old's the
37:50 universe you know i looked up at the sky
37:52 today and i realized it doesn't have a
37:54 wall
37:55 you know for the folks that believe that
37:58 and i need you to solve this problem for
38:01 me
38:02 so then come these folks to go hey check
38:04 this out you know what i got this theory
38:07 it's all [ __ ] but people it's very
38:09 easy to understand so people are gonna
38:11 believe it
38:12 and we can milk them for some serious
38:14 research funds
38:15 grants and what have you because in the
38:18 end it's going to return order to
38:20 society
38:20 where these these new nervous points
38:24 have swelled
38:27 what i've been trying to ask myself
38:29 recently is
38:31 have we ever been enlightened as a
38:35 result of a dream
38:37 and you know there there are
38:41 so many uh categories of that one of
38:43 them could be simply
38:44 you're trying to solve a problem in the
38:45 real world so you dream the solution in
38:47 your dream
38:48 that makes sense your brain's still
38:49 going on that problem you went to bed
38:51 before you could finish that
38:53 you're exhausted you can't keep your
38:55 eyes open any longer
38:58 and so there's that issue the other one
39:00 is to have
39:02 one of these big epiphanies and i don't
39:04 know that i've
39:05 ever had this happen to me nothing comes
39:08 to mind
39:08 whatsoever and i think if this were to
39:10 occur
39:12 i would remember i mean the only thing
39:14 that i have ever had
39:16 which i said this story a long time ago
39:18 was that there was a dream i was having
39:20 i was playing a stand-up arcade game
39:22 it's probably about 1985
39:25 in the dream and my parents came in and
39:28 said let's go let's go we gotta go
39:30 and so i'm in the middle of a game and
39:32 so in the middle of this game
39:36 i took a ram card which doesn't exist
39:39 and i put it in the machine's base and i
39:41 pushed a button and it downloaded the
39:43 game into my ram card
39:45 and i took it with me to go wherever the
39:48 hell i was going
39:49 in fact i think i woke up right after
39:51 that moment and i thought to myself oh
39:53 my god
39:54 this was already being done in the in
39:56 the real world but i was
39:58 in the middle of kansas i had no idea
39:59 that anybody was doing this but i was
40:01 pretty sure
40:03 this is where things were going to go
40:05 and i said geez you know why are we
40:07 making any
40:08 moving objects for sound devices
40:13 a spinning record an a-track a cassette
40:16 a cd player
40:17 why is anything moving why can't we just
40:19 put it on ram
40:21 now the obvious answer is ram cost a
40:23 tremendous amount of money they hadn't
40:25 figured out how to stack
40:26 electrons that densely in memory so that
40:29 was why
40:30 but we ended up let's see
40:33 2001 i think the ipod was debuted i
40:36 think somewhere in there so it took
40:38 about 16 years
40:40 to have a device that was exactly that
40:43 arcade game sadly died off
40:46 by way if you're a big fan of arcade
40:48 games
40:49 i have an episode called arcade games so
40:52 if you ever want to
40:53 know what it was like to be in the late
40:55 70s all the way up through
40:57 probably into the 90s and just what it
40:59 was like to be a kid in that era and
41:01 walk into those amazing arcades i mean
41:04 it was
41:05 it's a saddest loss for humanity because
41:08 we all still like games
41:09 and we still like casual games right
41:11 we're playing them on our telephones by
41:12 ourselves
41:13 instead of in these beautiful dark
41:16 dungeons of tons of sounds and amazing
41:20 stuff so i recreate that in an episode
41:21 so go just go to deepdodsvideo.com
41:24 and type in arcade in the search field
41:26 and you'll find it and i think you'll
41:27 enjoy it
41:28 if if that appeals to you whatsoever
41:31 but the thing i came up with in the
41:33 ancient mind episode
41:36 which you guys liked way more than i
41:37 ever thought you were gonna like i'm so
41:38 impressed i'm so happy that we're on the
41:40 same wavelength
41:42 was that you know our dreams are
41:46 obviously and this is no
41:48 huge surprise they are facsimiling this
41:51 reality
41:54 and again i've had a handful of dreams
41:56 that were very esoteric and strange
41:58 and you know i've got a whole category
42:00 of dreams that are
42:01 frustration dreams where again i'm like
42:04 i'm like either an atom
42:06 or i am a cell in a body and it's just
42:09 really strange you have no per well you
42:11 have a purpose i guess but you can't
42:12 figure out what it is you just
42:14 can't go anywhere you can't do anything
42:16 you're stuck and it's just so
42:17 frustrating i haven't had that dream in
42:19 years but
42:20 i used to have that one as a young kid i
42:22 didn't realize that
42:23 in order to break a frustration dream if
42:25 you have this happen to you and you're
42:27 probably wise enough to figure this out
42:28 for yourself
42:29 if you have any dream that's messing
42:30 with you
42:32 whether it be very literal like this
42:34 world or something really esoteric
42:37 just get up if nothing else if you've
42:40 got a spouse or something and you don't
42:41 want to freak out the kids or whatever
42:43 just grab your
42:44 phone lean over this other bed where
42:46 your phone won't bother turn the sound
42:47 down
42:48 and just go do something completely
42:50 different read
42:51 your favorite poetry or whatever it is
42:53 man just get yourself away from
42:56 the algorithm that you're thinking for
42:59 boys
42:59 i know that when we play video games
43:03 for an extended period of time a
43:05 mechanic of that
43:08 game will be in your dream overlaid on
43:10 top of
43:11 something that you're doing so like you
43:12 can build a city in a game right
43:15 in your building and you're laying down
43:17 buildings and zoning things or whatever
43:18 the hell you're doing defense
43:20 tower defense game or something and then
43:21 somehow
43:23 your last i don't know 72 hours of life
43:26 gets overlaid with this mechanism
43:28 and it's just bizarre like your living
43:30 room is a game or something it's just
43:31 really strange
43:33 what i find fascinating about these
43:35 conversations about dreams the way we do
43:36 it
43:37 and the way we discuss it in comments
43:41 is that you know i haven't done a deep
43:44 dive on dream labs
43:45 in the last 10 years let's just say
43:49 but there's times in my life when i
43:51 really got into it
43:53 and you know they will find out
43:57 interesting things but the weird thing
43:59 about dream
44:00 labs as i've had them documented
44:04 is they're never going for any of the
44:05 fun stuff that we're talking about
44:07 trying to figure out what is actually in
44:10 a dream what is not in the dream
44:12 and what motivates a dream
44:16 you know they're trying to there's some
44:20 papers that say they're able to actually
44:21 view your dream
44:24 which would demand that your dream is
44:26 actually projecting
44:27 the facsimile on your visual cortex and
44:30 they're reading
44:31 the layers of your visual cortex
44:35 in some dot matrix so that you can see
44:38 your dreams
44:40 i will not believe that that's possible
44:41 until i see it because i just don't
44:43 believe that
44:45 your mind is synthesizing
44:48 things to your visual cortex such that
44:51 you can see them in your mind's eye
44:53 necessarily maybe that's occurring maybe
44:55 it's not
44:57 they're trying to figure out a way to
44:58 see your memories as well
45:00 while you're awake and someone i just
45:03 read a paper
45:04 probably last year or someone say man
45:07 they really have some
45:08 some foggy images that definitely look
45:11 like
45:13 real things and those real things are
45:15 not in front of the person who's having
45:17 those memories they'll put them in dark
45:18 rooms or something hook them up to a
45:19 bunch of electrodes
45:22 but considering we only use about 10
45:24 percent of our visual cortex
45:26 due to our genetic hobbling
45:30 by whoever designed us you can't
45:33 access 90 of your visual cortex
45:36 according to this anthropologist who's
45:37 an expert in it
45:39 and it's a protein blocker that has been
45:42 installed
45:44 to limit the uh how do you say this
45:48 the scanning of memory in your visual
45:51 cortex so you got a bunch of cells
45:52 that are all stacked up to create this
45:54 matrix just like a
45:56 ccd in your camera that you take a
45:58 picture with
46:00 and um when we go for it there's a
46:03 blocker that says you can't go any
46:04 further than this the circuit will end
46:05 it's like a terminator back in the day
46:07 when you used to wire a bunch of
46:08 electronics together you had to have
46:09 this little terminator at the end
46:11 to stop the signal and make it bounce
46:13 back the other direction
46:15 luckily that's been fixed natively in
46:18 all hardware
46:20 to imagine that other 90 percent is used
46:23 for more
46:25 esoteric purposes such as dreams it
46:27 wouldn't really matter
46:29 in our analysis it'd be fun to know but
46:31 it wouldn't really matter
46:33 i would love to hear someone else other
46:35 than this gentleman i listened to this
46:37 gosh probably three hour lecture and his
46:40 big thing was um
46:42 it's gonna sound crazy but he was
46:44 looking for the missing link
46:46 he was trying to determine whether
46:47 bigfoot could be real
46:50 and he was presenting a kind of
46:53 uh with no bias he was saying there are
46:56 definitely things that make us think
46:57 that
46:58 there might be these big creatures in
47:00 the forest but then again
47:02 they never do the due diligence that we
47:03 did in our um
47:05 i know it was episode 200 or 300 where i
47:08 think we absolutely obliterated the
47:10 theory that these things could exist
47:12 unless they are truly
47:13 magical beings you know so yeah i don't
47:16 think i've had any
47:18 major epiphanies so please share some if
47:20 you've had some
47:23 we need to know that these things are
47:25 possible because this is the new
47:26 frontier isn't it
47:28 if someone was in europe and said man
47:30 i'm going to sail across the atlantic
47:32 ocean and get to this other continent
47:33 which i think is going to be india
47:37 and then you find the americas and
47:40 it's a brand new continent with a whole
47:42 other civilization there
47:44 and the civilization already vulcanized
47:46 themselves into
47:47 tribes imagine that we hadn't gone over
47:52 and been mean and strange
47:55 and unintelligent about the whole thing
47:57 i mean no one would really know what we
47:59 treated them like but the stories are
48:00 pretty bad
48:01 especially eventuality of course i think
48:04 we obviously missed out on
48:07 who these folks really were because by
48:09 the time they started telling us stories
48:11 with all my research
48:13 i still own a ton of my books i got from
48:15 stanford on this
48:17 they didn't trust the white men and so
48:18 they were just making up stuff
48:20 trying to disinfo the white man from
48:23 saying hey if we tell you something
48:24 about us you're going to use it against
48:25 us
48:25 to screw you here's a dream catcher
48:28 which apparently is not a real thing
48:31 and just to clarify that too because i
48:34 had a guy who sells
48:35 native american art he's a
48:38 acquaintance of mine i should say but he
48:40 was pretty og dude man
48:43 very wealthy guy brilliant in completely
48:46 different ways and probably fairly
48:48 nefarious in other ways
48:50 but he goes you know i sell these dream
48:51 catchers to all these people and he goes
48:54 they're not real that's not what they
48:56 are supposed to be he goes this design
48:58 has been created for years but it has
48:59 nothing to do with
49:00 catching your dreams but that's what
49:03 happens
49:04 when you persecute a whole population
49:08 and then ask them to tell you a story
49:11 so we we missed out we screwed up and we
49:14 screwed up major ways and this has been
49:16 going on all over the planet of course
49:20 it's just we had printing presses to
49:22 record this particular one so it's
49:23 one that we all regret deeply you know
49:27 but the other question i have is
49:30 you know i've asserted several different
49:33 theories about
49:34 why dreams even exist because
49:38 you know it's like um there's probably
49:42 two ways to look at obviously there's
49:43 the evolutionary there's no god
49:46 theory of what you would have to do to
49:47 explain why
49:49 man has evolved to have dreams
49:53 you know all the excuses of why we sleep
49:55 are just guesses
49:56 and i respect that you're filing away
49:59 your memories is one of the funniest
50:00 ones i've ever heard is like oh really
50:02 how did you prove that you know it's a
50:04 neat theory and maybe you're right but
50:05 like how do you prove it to yourself
50:07 that you're saying this to me like it's
50:09 oh it's definitely that way
50:10 again science bs to calm society that
50:14 needs to go back to work essentially
50:16 right
50:18 let's go back to life at least on a
50:21 celestial level
50:23 if we have souls and there's a heaven
50:24 and there's a giant ecosystem that we're
50:26 unaware of because we can't sense it
50:30 directly then we have to use all of our
50:32 indirect
50:33 experiences that are paranormal
50:37 and just straight up observations of the
50:39 meticulous
50:40 second to second things that happen in
50:42 our life to deduce what that other world
50:44 might be
50:46 i do think that i don't know
50:50 if this is in the bible or what have you
50:52 some of you bible experts maybe you can
50:53 help me out with this one
50:55 but somewhere some point in my life
50:57 someone told me a beautiful little
50:58 saying and
50:59 it pretty much went like this you were
51:02 born with all of the truth
51:04 that you need that could mean two
51:07 different things
51:09 and both of them could be true the truth
51:11 is either in you
51:12 which is sort of what i think but i
51:15 think it's it's a mechanism
51:17 or the truth is around you and if you
51:20 get really existential about truth well
51:22 then we are all truth
51:24 because we exist existence is truth
51:28 it is what is you know what is is what
51:31 is true
51:32 and regardless if it hurts your feelings
51:33 or not it's still true as many wise
51:35 people have said over the years
51:37 now let's say you're a conscious and
51:39 you're trying to deduce an answer to
51:41 something
51:42 i think that you get answers back from
51:44 the universe to the degree you build a
51:46 good database query and i've said this
51:48 in previous episodes
51:50 but now what if you or i mean some of
51:53 you aren't technical
51:54 i think you'll get this but for those of
51:57 you who are coders or you've been a
51:59 coder in your lifetime this will make a
52:00 lot of sense to you
52:02 we have a very popular database
52:06 species out there in the world called
52:07 sql
52:10 and it's was designed to be easy for any
52:12 human being to write a query into a
52:14 database without being a computer
52:15 engineer
52:17 and in basic cases they're absolutely
52:19 right and very quickly like the rules of
52:21 chess
52:22 you can get into super complex
52:24 mind-blowing queries
52:26 but here's the thing all that matters is
52:28 this
52:31 i'll give you a kind of a paraphrase of
52:33 a query
52:35 let's say you had a database of animals
52:38 that are in your shelter
52:40 here comes a car
52:44 so you have a database of all these
52:45 animals in your
52:47 and your shelter they're all checked in
52:49 and put in this database their
52:50 species their weight their age just
52:53 everything you could possibly put into
52:55 this
52:55 this database and you want to know what
52:59 the average age is
53:00 of all of the animals that you have
53:04 because that's going to tell you perhaps
53:06 your adoption rate because people
53:08 typically shy away from older animals
53:11 for younger animals to get more life out
53:13 of them right less medical problems and
53:15 that kind of stuff
53:16 but you write a query it's all about
53:20 weight and color select all
53:23 dogs wear color equals red
53:27 you know or age or not even age weight
53:29 equals
53:30 over because you might be able to do
53:32 this age from weight or something but
53:33 it's not true
53:34 but anyway over 50 pounds or something
53:36 like that
53:38 you're obviously going to get back the
53:39 wrong results because you're looking for
53:42 an age
53:42 average you need to select all dogs
53:46 select star from dogs and put an average
53:50 equation in your where clause to figure
53:51 out
53:52 total all up baby and let me know the
53:54 average age you get back to query in two
53:56 seconds
53:58 this is an analogy for the way that we
54:00 as human beings
54:02 sit down and solve problems
54:05 if there's that scene i always mention
54:08 it's an
54:08 indiana jones three sean connery and
54:12 harrison ford are stuck in a big tower
54:15 nazis are coming up the tower
54:16 it's like a rook tower and some castle
54:19 and they can't get out and they're
54:20 pinned at the top of the rook tower sean
54:24 connery says well you know what i find
54:25 is if i just sit down and relax
54:28 the solution presents itself something
54:30 like that
54:31 and he sits down in a chair and the
54:33 chair is rigged
54:35 to trigger a staircase that goes down
54:37 it's a silly scene
54:38 but it is the truth that wisdom now this
54:42 was a mechanical solution to
54:44 the problem in the movie but it is
54:46 really true that if you sit down
54:49 and start to digest all of the data you
54:52 have
54:53 around the thing you're trying to solve
54:56 what i think you're doing because you're
54:58 if you just think about your
55:00 brain going out your pineal gland which
55:03 is why you have to keep that thing very
55:04 healthy
55:05 out through your soul out to the
55:07 universe who has
55:08 all of the truth in the big database up
55:10 there you're essentially
55:12 using your mind to construct a query
55:15 to send through your soul to the
55:18 universe to get that information
55:19 back have you ever wondered why some
55:22 people are so much more successful than
55:24 other people
55:25 but when you sit them down and start
55:27 talking to them they
55:28 seem like average people they don't have
55:30 an extended vocabulary
55:33 on certain things that they're not
55:34 interested in trying to solve problems
55:36 with they're complete
55:37 neophytes they don't know anything and
55:40 they may even believe
55:41 like um blue pill stuff because that's
55:45 just uh
55:47 that's what makes them comfortable
55:49 however
55:51 when they think about problems that are
55:54 either
55:55 whatever problem they're trying to think
55:56 of a construction problem a surgery
55:58 problem a computer problem
56:00 whatever it is they have because of
56:02 their experience
56:04 more data cloud information
56:07 to sift through and create a better
56:08 query so when they ask the universe a
56:11 question they ask a
56:12 very specific question which can only
56:15 return
56:16 if there's an answer at all the truth
56:19 and boom here comes one of my theories
56:23 about dreams
56:25 sort of relating to this strenuous
56:28 day-to-day thing to exist
56:31 when you wake up it doesn't matter how
56:33 young you are or how old you are
56:36 you're you're going through your life
56:38 loops
56:40 and no matter how much you've done them
56:41 before
56:43 you know sometimes loops loops are
56:46 frustrating sometimes and i'll give you
56:47 some examples
56:49 your bathroom ritual uh just brushing
56:52 your teeth flossing
56:54 as you get older that's why a lot of
56:55 teeth get bad in people because they
56:57 just get tired they're like i have
56:58 brushed my teeth
56:59 20 000 times and i just don't want to do
57:02 it anymore
57:03 so they start skipping days not
57:05 realizing well did you eat sugar tonight
57:06 because it might have a whole mouthful
57:08 of stuff that's going to eat your teeth
57:10 maybe just at least correlate it with
57:13 your eating habits
57:14 how many of you love filling up your car
57:16 with gas
57:18 now let's just say you're a millionaire
57:19 and the money thing is not a big issue
57:21 well it's not much for us and it's going
57:23 up like crazy recently here
57:26 it's not even summer time it's almost at
57:28 six bucks here in l.a
57:30 but you're doing stuff with your life
57:32 and you're like god i gotta go fill up
57:34 my car
57:35 and find that station i like you know
57:37 and whatever
57:39 and you got to find a gas station you're
57:41 in some foreign town
57:42 you don't even know where any are and
57:43 it's just bizarre sometimes you drive in
57:45 towns and you're
57:47 i know let me know if you've ever
57:48 experienced this you drive into a town
57:50 like i went to um joshua tree
57:54 last year and there was a point we
57:58 needed food
57:59 and we're trying to find the restaurant
58:01 circuit in the town
58:03 and you know it was right when this
58:05 whole masking thing came about and so
58:08 much most places were closed so it has
58:10 to all be drive through and we're trying
58:12 to find the drive to thing it just took
58:13 us like
58:14 half an hour to find it but i've been in
58:16 the bay area where i couldn't find a gas
58:18 station
58:18 i mean just you get into pockets it's
58:20 just strange but anyway
58:22 this day-to-day churn is taxing on your
58:24 system
58:25 isn't it and so in a dream
58:28 you don't have to do it anymore there's
58:30 no more bills
58:32 some more taxes your body
58:35 is not hurting at any point in time let
58:38 me know if you've ever just been in
58:39 ambient pain in a dream
58:41 i've never been an ambient pain in a
58:42 dream i might be
58:44 scared when i was younger something's
58:46 chasing me or something like that and
58:48 that's fear that's an emotional pool
58:50 thing
58:51 but it's sort of a stress-free place
58:54 isn't it
58:55 if your dream gets infected with stress
58:57 then you're gonna have a stress stream
58:58 and then
58:59 you get up and do something watch some
59:01 funny videos on
59:04 youtube watch uh half an hour of your
59:07 was a daily dose of internet and
59:08 man that will just soothe your soul
59:10 trust me that's to unwind your mind
59:15 so perhaps sleep as it relates to dreams
59:19 it's just that oasis you can go to where
59:22 amen it's all okay you know
59:25 and i assume that outside of a
59:29 material body that's the world we're in
59:32 that is a heaven
59:33 remember that place that no one can
59:35 describe
59:37 you know again if you want to have a fun
59:40 fun conversation at some dinner with
59:42 people if the conversation is kind of
59:43 getting
59:45 dry or something and you want to spark
59:46 it up with some interesting
59:48 things don't let it get too religious or
59:50 anything but just say
59:52 blame it on me just ah watching this guy
59:54 on youtube and he said
59:57 you know ask two questions one do you
60:00 believe in a heaven
60:01 of any kind and if anybody says yes
60:05 which a lot of people do probably the
60:07 majority of society does regardless of
60:08 what their definition is
60:10 or what their thought process is about
60:11 it
60:13 we like that idea that man there's no
60:15 pain after this one you know
60:17 but then say okay define it
60:21 what is heaven i mean tell me what do
60:23 you think it is physically
60:25 are you gonna be human you're gonna be a
60:26 soul is there
60:28 gates or is it pearly gates as i always
60:31 say
60:31 is someone gonna be looking at you in a
60:33 book that's a more religious thing but
60:36 i've asked people this and i just see
60:38 dear eyes and it it's so
60:40 fun because you see them
60:44 make an expression on their face that
60:45 says
60:47 no one has ever asked me that question
60:48 before
60:50 now pull pull in the second question
60:53 and say okay what do you think dreams
60:57 are
60:58 i mean what do you think they are why do
61:00 you have them
61:01 and that's kind of depressing if half
61:03 the people the people go i don't dream
61:04 at all
61:06 like you're an npc but chances are
61:10 if we were to assemble say a thousand to
61:12 ten thousand humans
61:13 who claim they do dream and
61:18 give them a piece of paper or whatever
61:20 and say okay don't you know quarantine
61:22 everybody away from each other so they
61:23 can't steal each other's answers
61:26 but just say hey look um write down what
61:29 you think
61:29 a dream is i'm willing to bet
61:32 one or two people out of a big group
61:36 would come up with a brand new
61:37 explanation that we have never conceived
61:40 of
61:41 that would boil the whole thing down for
61:43 whatever reason they simply just
61:45 summed it up perfectly we'd love to hear
61:48 a bunch of different answers on that
61:50 without someone trying to quote someone
61:52 else's research right
61:54 but now let's take dreams and just
61:58 uh come at it from this perspective if
62:01 you believe in creationism
62:03 which is something from something then
62:06 we are most likely divinely created
62:11 by something if you want to say
62:14 it's evolution which is the paradox of
62:18 something from nothing then whatever
62:20 it's kind of the same mechanic
62:22 even though there's no explanation for
62:24 how it began
62:26 we we would have dreams
62:30 designed as a
62:34 a reality for us even though we know
62:37 we are all snowflakes as human beings
62:39 and that all of our dreams are
62:41 profoundly different in their mechanism
62:44 and there's been shows on tv that
62:46 recreate people's dreams
62:48 either either to get them through
62:49 anxiety or something like that and you
62:51 know
62:52 people uh will in hollywood every once
62:54 in a while will create a dream sequence
62:56 and oh my god they're starting to get it
62:58 man i mean they're starting to realize
63:00 lighting flow
63:03 so i think there is a pretty damn
63:06 unified experience that we're having
63:07 when we have it even though the subject
63:09 matter
63:09 varies quite a bit but if we were to
63:12 apply the discipline
63:14 to dreams that we apply to our dna for
63:16 instance
63:19 it's a fascinating concept let's just
63:21 say
63:22 that the paradigm of dreaming it's it's
63:25 very borders
63:26 of functionality meaning let's just say
63:29 we could figure out something that
63:31 never happens in a dream and something
63:33 that
63:34 most often happens in dreams then we
63:37 start
63:37 seeing the bits and pieces of the design
63:41 you know you um you wouldn't be
63:44 surprised if you got in a car and there
63:46 wasn't a refrigerator in the car
63:48 wouldn't surprise you it's not designed
63:50 to do that it's an a to b
63:52 vehicle some with obviously much more
63:55 luxurious experiences in between but
63:58 still
63:59 it's it's got to function
64:02 and designers designed it we're most
64:06 obviously a creature
64:08 that has through whatever process
64:11 ended up as who we are today of course
64:15 our abilities you know you talk about
64:18 insects
64:18 insects can hold you know hundreds of
64:20 times their own weight
64:23 well we would have to change
64:25 substantially
64:27 to do that with our own weight mass and
64:29 of course there's some norwegian guys
64:31 that seem to get get pretty close to
64:33 lifting
64:34 at least 10 times their weight but 100
64:37 times that's amazing
64:39 there's a need for that which is why
64:40 that insect can do that
64:42 to pull back a bug they found that's 100
64:45 times bigger than them that's huge right
64:46 an ant bringing back a
64:48 cicada i mean that's just like me
64:50 dragging a
64:51 a building hey guys yeah you found a
64:53 building you want some
64:55 but with dreams well what would be some
64:59 of the
64:59 constraints that would be in the
65:02 conversation about dreams you know
65:04 one of the dreams i had that actually
65:05 had a bit of
65:07 stationary walking
65:10 you know i stopped walking in the dream
65:12 was and i told this story a long time
65:14 ago
65:15 i went into a room where
65:19 there were all these tables and they
65:21 were like cylinders
65:23 all the way to the ground no kick plate
65:25 or anything at the bottom i mean no
65:27 place where
65:27 you know there was no feature to the the
65:30 tables at all and it was all these nerds
65:32 in white lab jackets
65:35 and some guys were like drafting uh
65:38 buildings and some guys were like doing
65:40 weird things with weird
65:41 like slide ruler looking things not
65:43 quite but different
65:44 celestial strange and immediately in
65:47 this room i got the sense that
65:50 this was where dreams were made and that
65:53 i had walked in the room that i wasn't
65:54 supposed to walk into
65:56 the funny thing was they were happy to
65:59 see me
66:00 and they were hazing a new employee that
66:02 was the funny thing there was a kid who
66:03 was trying to figure something out
66:05 and i kind of walked in the room right
66:07 when the hazing punch line was about to
66:09 occur where
66:10 they were going to let the kid know that
66:11 he screwed something up but it was all
66:13 in fun it was everyone was being really
66:14 nice to everyone
66:16 and they just knew he kind of got it
66:19 over his head so
66:20 i remember him holding some paper and
66:23 some plastic and stuff and he looks at
66:24 me
66:25 got a little chubby little guy young kid
66:28 he looks at me and he's
66:29 got glasses on and he's just got this
66:31 big smile on his face the whole room was
66:32 laughing
66:33 at whatever it was and he was excited to
66:35 be there it was good
66:37 and so i remember asking them what is
66:40 this place
66:42 and through whatever means of
66:43 communication
66:45 i don't remember someone someone may
66:47 have said this on point but they were
66:49 kind of like this is where your dreams
66:50 are made man
66:52 i said well let me look around i said
66:54 sure go ahead look around
66:55 and i walked past all these tables with
66:57 these guys and there was a back
66:59 area of this room with tons of tables
67:02 with little tiny cylinders
67:05 that look like the table shape but just
67:07 you know like like a coffee mug size
67:09 thing
67:10 all over all these tables just these
67:12 little cylinders and they're just solid
67:15 i couldn't figure that out and that's
67:16 when the dream lapsed out because i got
67:18 so excited i got to this room
67:21 my brain threw me out of the dream
67:23 that's always what it is right
67:25 the dreams definitely serve a function
67:29 what surprises me is hearing people that
67:31 don't dream
67:32 one of my closest friends when she
67:35 dreams
67:37 she remembers it and she calls me up and
67:39 she's oh man i had this stream and da da
67:41 da da i'm like awesome
67:42 and then but she'll say most the time i
67:45 don't dream
67:46 but now the interesting difference
67:48 between the two of us is that
67:50 she falls asleep instantaneously i mean
67:53 her head hits a pillow boom she's out
67:55 and i
67:56 roll around and roll around but if she
67:58 has nights first she'll call me up and
67:59 say man i can't
68:00 sleep and i'm just like okay let me talk
68:03 yeah
68:04 talk your right to sling ball she'll
68:05 fall asleep on the phone it's absolutely
68:07 hilarious
68:09 which by the way with cell phones
68:13 for those of you old enough to remember
68:14 life before cell phones if you ever fell
68:16 asleep on the phone with somebody back
68:18 in the day
68:21 they squawk the phone the people forget
68:23 this ever happen they just go
68:26 and you'd wake up and like oh my god put
68:28 the phone down
68:29 because you could have an emergency
68:33 phone call coming in
68:35 and you'd be at a house with say four
68:37 phones and it was funny you'd pick up
68:39 the phone to make a phone call and it's
68:40 squawking on
68:41 on the one that was already hung up
68:43 because there's some phone in the house
68:44 that's off the hook
68:46 i just think it's funny that i'm old
68:48 enough now where
68:49 i've got those memories embedded in my
68:51 mind and my history
68:53 and nobody remembers the other big one
68:56 was a bunch of you just said this
68:57 comment
68:58 probably three of you said this comment
69:00 the other day i don't know what
69:01 triggered it but
69:03 i think it was asking you guys how many
69:05 channels you had in your respective
69:06 countries
69:07 and many of you said man we only had
69:09 three or four channels same in america
69:12 about 1980 you could get hbo you know
69:15 very quick after that everything blew up
69:18 but television used to stop
69:20 between 10 and midnight depending on
69:22 what channel you're watching and that's
69:23 the movie poltergeist in 1982
69:26 with a little girl would wait up
69:30 until the television went off and they
69:31 do the
69:33 national anthem and then it would go to
69:36 static
69:37 and see if you left the tv on back in
69:38 the day you'd wake up and your tv is
69:40 just making that horrible white noise
69:42 just
69:44 you need to do oh god i gotta keep
69:45 turning tv off you know
69:47 but let's just review real quick before
69:49 we end the episode
69:53 let me know what you think mine are most
69:56 definitely predominantly an emotional
69:58 experience
69:59 i don't really know the percentage you
70:01 know i would say at a minimum it's 60
70:03 emotional it might even be 80 emotional
70:05 i don't know
70:06 i don't know how you quantify
70:08 percentages in this realm but i just
70:10 know for a fact that without my body
70:13 being
70:14 preoccupied with its touch
70:17 sense for the most part not a smell
70:20 sense although i did have a smell one
70:22 the other day
70:23 i forgot the hell it was and my friend
70:25 she came to me and said she had a um
70:28 a dream and the i had to smell one
70:30 recently and i can't remember what it
70:31 was but the dream before that where i
70:33 reported smell was i was at like
70:35 um a vineyard
70:39 and there were some berries or something
70:40 growing on a
70:42 vine structure thing but it wasn't uh
70:45 it wasn't necessarily grapes i don't
70:47 know it seemed like it's more plummish
70:49 and i remember smelling that but mostly
70:51 senses are off
70:52 so everything's going to this more
70:54 cerebral visual input it's extremely
70:56 visual isn't it
70:58 audio for sure because you're talking to
71:00 people
71:02 but sometimes i even wonder you know am
71:04 i really hearing anyone in a dream or am
71:07 i just
71:08 espn or having telepathy i should say
71:12 with them i don't know if i would know
71:15 the difference
71:16 what has never happened in a dream is
71:19 two things with sound
71:21 i've never ever ever had to say what'd
71:24 you say no one's ever spoke so softly
71:27 that i couldn't hear them
71:29 the other thing that's never happened i
71:31 don't think in a dream is a really loud
71:33 noise
71:34 where i'm like shocked you know i do
71:37 have a weird thing that happens
71:40 once a quarter maybe twice a quarter of
71:43 a year
71:44 where i'll be in twilight zone going to
71:46 bed
71:48 and then i will hear like a gunshot of
71:51 firework something is just a big bang
71:54 and it has no context it just goes bang
71:57 i'll jump in bed
71:58 it's just a really weird thing but
72:00 that's never while i'm asleep
72:03 so think about those limitations if
72:06 we're drawing it on a whiteboard
72:07 having a brainstorming session about
72:09 what dreams are we're kind of saying you
72:11 know we'll say we have 10 chronic
72:13 dreamers in the room
72:14 or more and we go okay guys do you have
72:17 this happen
72:18 and if if it's a point where like out of
72:21 10 people nine people going no i never
72:23 have that but one person is going
72:24 definitely i've had that experience
72:26 so you write in kind of a secondary
72:27 column to say okay this is possible
72:30 apparently but the majority of people
72:32 don't have that particular experience
72:33 and maybe we can drag out of the person
72:36 when they had this exceptional
72:37 experience
72:38 what was going on in your dream and
72:40 perhaps find the triggers
72:42 for what's causing this to occur
72:46 but okay let me give you some simple
72:49 things that if if man would truly get
72:53 enlightened and put this kind of stuff
72:55 inside a deep thoughts university
72:58 we might want to like people don't sit
73:01 around and compare dreams
73:04 dreams is the weirdest thing we don't
73:06 talk about i mean it's almost like
73:09 you know it's like you don't sit in
73:11 public and talk about what porn you
73:12 watch or something right it's it's got
73:14 that weird taboo to it and it doesn't
73:16 have any tablet to it it's just a dream
73:18 what's the big deal but we almost forget
73:22 we have dreams until we get hop in bed
73:24 at night we're like oh yeah i'm gonna
73:25 have a dream tonight it's gonna be cool
73:26 and then we get out of bed in the
73:28 morning and for the first 10 minutes
73:30 while we're showering or whatever oh
73:31 that was a cool dream man that was
73:33 really awesome that's all grandma last
73:34 night or whatever it was
73:36 but after that it's like it doesn't
73:39 happen
73:40 until you get right back in the context
73:41 where dreams occur
73:43 why not create a situation where a bunch
73:46 of human beings
73:47 continually dialogue about dreams and
73:49 not necessarily just to entertain each
73:51 other that's good
73:52 but let's just say someone's telling a
73:54 dream i did it several times in this
73:56 episode
73:57 one could listen to those stories almost
74:01 like a
74:02 dream psychologist and go okay i'm not
74:04 gonna interrupt you
74:05 you talk about your dreams start to
74:07 finish as detailed as you can remember
74:09 and what i'm gonna do is not the
74:11 freudian thing to try to figure out how
74:12 much you
74:13 hate your mother or hate your father and
74:14 want to make love to your mother
74:17 i'm going to write down the thresholds
74:18 of your experiences
74:21 i might ask you a question well when you
74:24 grab that object did you feel it
74:26 or did you just grab it you might go oh
74:29 i don't remember well that means you
74:31 probably didn't feel it you know
74:32 you're not sure and you're being honest
74:34 with me but we're just going to go ahead
74:35 and write a barrier to that
74:38 but what if you did a million people a
74:40 million different dreams
74:42 i'm willing to bet there's data that
74:44 will reveal itself
74:47 such that we can get at least a paradigm
74:51 schematic of what dreams are
74:54 you know my episode about this space
74:56 exists
74:59 and i'm sure a bunch of you haven't
75:00 heard that episode and i get lectured
75:03 by people all the time space doesn't
75:04 exist you're stupid if i talk about
75:06 anything
75:06 related space as far as my
75:10 knowledge if you look back at deep dots
75:12 uh season one
75:13 which is on a separate channel now
75:16 because it's been remastered go to
75:18 deepthoughtsradio.com and click on that
75:20 channel and you'll see it
75:21 but just search on the website and
75:22 you'll find everything
75:24 but the way that i figured out this
75:26 question
75:27 was to say i never dream of being in
75:30 space
75:32 this is still a paradox in my brain but
75:35 i thought of this idea
75:37 while i was doing my other show with my
75:38 buddy who is a space
75:40 special effects super expert double emmy
75:45 for his work on space fights in space
75:48 he's
75:48 he has worked uh he just finished top
75:52 gun but
75:53 he's been working on star trek since the
75:54 90s he got hired by the babylon 5 guy
75:58 when he first got his first break he has
76:00 been doing space for
76:03 two and a half decades his buddies
76:06 have been in the industry at least as
76:08 long as him if not longer
76:11 so i asked him i said have you ever
76:12 dreamed of being in space
76:14 things what do you mean so it's just as
76:17 simple as the question man do you ever
76:18 see you know you worked on star trek for
76:21 god knows i mean almost 10 years i said
76:23 did you ever dream about being in the
76:25 enterprise
76:26 now one person in the comments of this
76:28 entire show said that they had that
76:29 dream but then he said he was on a bunch
76:31 of cough syrup which i think is
76:32 hilarious
76:33 thank you for sharing that if you're
76:34 still listening in fact if you're still
76:36 listening let me know i think it'll be
76:38 great
76:39 so he looks at me on this porch in the
76:41 middle of summer and he goes
76:43 no i never have and i just see him
76:46 looking at his world you know he's like
76:48 how's that possible
76:50 how's it possible that i'm in it all day
76:53 all day and he has 14 hour days working
76:56 in these special effects places
76:58 so he goes to work he gets in the room
77:01 with all the other dudes
77:02 i gotta say anybody i got a question for
77:04 you have any one of you
77:06 dreamed of being in space i mean we work
77:08 in this industry all day long
77:10 everybody looked at each other and went
77:12 no
77:13 and they all got their brains blown you
77:15 know
77:17 so that the only thing i could think of
77:21 it's the only thing i think now i've
77:22 dreamed of being in different parts of
77:24 the world
77:25 but i will say as much as i've talked
77:28 about it
77:28 pyramids i never dreamed of being at the
77:30 pyramids i've
77:32 seen major cities all over the world and
77:35 plenty of movies and stuff
77:37 i do not dream of things that aren't
77:39 directly in my area of influence
77:42 uh like it's not quite absolute because
77:45 i do dream of skyscrapers and things
77:47 i've never been in
77:49 i've never been at the um eiffel tower
77:51 in a dream big ben in a dream
77:53 the taj mahal in a dream i know these
77:55 places exist
77:58 i don't think i've ever been australia
78:00 in a dream i've been in australia
78:02 no i don't dream about you in australia
78:03 i didn't dream about it you know so
78:07 they're it's it's almost like it's a
78:10 subject limiter in the dreams
78:14 now i've got a whole nother episode
78:15 that's like the threshold of
78:17 intelligence which is
78:18 there are certain subject matters that
78:20 when humans think about it there seems
78:22 to be almost this phantom force
78:24 saying don't think about that might have
78:27 a relation
78:28 don't know the places i dream
78:32 don't really exist i mean again there's
78:34 a couple times to dream about my
78:35 hometown
78:37 people in my dreams will exist
78:42 but then they're really not who they are
78:43 in this world they
78:45 say things and do things they would
78:46 never do in this world
78:48 so they're bad facsimiles of humans and
78:51 i'm actually very glad because that
78:52 would get really confusing wouldn't it
78:54 if your parents act like
78:55 exactly like they act in real life in
78:57 your dream
79:00 and that's not that they won't say a
79:01 word that they've said before or a
79:03 sentence they've said before to you to
79:04 kick off the
79:05 dream but overall like they're pretty
79:08 unique
79:09 pretty unique beings that just happen to
79:11 look like people
79:12 and have you ever had a situation where
79:15 in addition to
79:16 everything else i've said in this
79:17 episode
79:20 where people transform you're talking to
79:23 somebody
79:24 you're even maybe but by yourself with
79:26 this other person
79:28 and for one part of the dream
79:31 their their gender in my mind brain
79:34 doesn't change
79:36 but so they're a phone if they're a
79:37 woman they're a woman if they're a guy
79:38 they're a guy but it might be my
79:39 girlfriend at the time
79:41 but then it turns into some other girl
79:43 and then some other girl
79:45 with an old lady you know i mean it just
79:47 changes it flows
79:50 and i don't seem to recognize that this
79:53 has occurred
79:54 except when i have the exceptional dream
79:56 where
79:57 i feel like i've lost somebody so
80:00 that's strange again i've never asked
80:02 anybody their name
80:04 i don't remember ever having a
80:06 one-on-one conversation with someone
80:08 for any experience extended period of
80:10 time it's
80:11 usually i'm looking for the next
80:13 location well where did so-and-so go oh
80:14 he went over here oh let's go over there
80:16 okay and by the time we get there
80:17 this person's somebody different and and
80:20 then it's like they vanish off to face
80:22 the planet it's totally cool i'm
80:23 losing people in my life you know it's
80:25 like a twilight zone and i'm comfortable
80:27 with it it's really
80:28 freaking bizarre bizarre bizarre
80:31 so i think that's about all i got with
80:33 this one
80:34 i've just been amassing this and when i
80:37 come up with an interesting little
80:39 tidbit you know it's kind of a bummer
80:42 because i
80:42 i do have this longer format so i try to
80:45 get several tidbits together before i
80:47 kind of drop an episode on this whole
80:48 thing
80:49 we haven't done much dream stuff this
80:51 season so it's about time we pushed out
80:52 another one
80:55 please share your experiences
80:59 if you can just so that i mean really
81:01 just whatever's really bizarre
81:03 you know your your your gold mines of
81:06 experiences and dreams
81:08 what i think is interesting is that we
81:09 have dreams when we're
81:12 young and there'll be a dream that when
81:15 you're young
81:17 like i've got dreams that i had when i
81:18 was nine years old i remember
81:20 my nightmares when i was a kid i
81:22 remember those because those are freaky
81:24 and strange but uh
81:28 a gorilla by about 25 feet tall broad
81:31 daylight summer
81:33 stomping through my neighborhood derby
81:34 kansas destroying all the houses and me
81:36 running from and looking back going oh
81:38 my god i just seen
81:39 the latest king kong movie i think it
81:42 was made in the 70s
81:44 i dreamed when i was 17. i had a baby
81:47 and in order to babysit this baby i had
81:50 to put it in this like shoebox thing
81:52 that was going to feed it and take care
81:53 of it it was the weirdest thing
81:55 this is so anti-baby this whole concept
81:58 wow some
82:00 orwellian thing crawled into my dream so
82:03 any of those experiences you have where
82:04 it might
82:05 dictate some of the edges of what the
82:08 dream paradigm could furnish for
82:10 all of us would love to hear those any
82:12 of the extreme cases
82:14 but also think about your senses that
82:17 you have when you're
82:18 conscious quote unquote who knows what
82:20 we are
82:22 you know touch that's a real rare one in
82:24 dreams for me personally
82:26 smell very rare for me personally
82:29 um sound what is the limitations of
82:33 sound have you ever been like
82:34 i was just having a conversation about
82:35 iron maiden the other day
82:38 and it my memory of going to iron maiden
82:40 in real life was that it was the loudest
82:42 concert i've ever been to i mean i
82:45 needed to bring ear plugs just to bring
82:46 it down to normal
82:48 my ears were ringing for days never
82:51 happens in a dream
82:53 and i told you i had those popping
82:55 noises when i'm in a twilight zone state
82:58 of mind what's interesting about that
83:01 is that if i were to ever hear the
83:04 report in my mind this bang
83:07 in real life i'd have ringing ears for
83:09 at least a few minutes
83:11 well i never have ringing when it
83:13 happens in that virtual realm
83:15 you know the only other one i'm going to
83:19 throw in at the last second this is sort
83:21 of
83:23 unrelated to necessarily dreams because
83:25 this is before i
83:26 lose consciousness and
83:29 i don't know there's no way to make an
83:31 episode about it so i'll just throw it
83:32 out there it's gonna sound nuts
83:35 but it's during my sleep and i'm not
83:38 really in twilight zone yet
83:40 i'm closing my eyes for the first time
83:41 to attempt to go to sleep
83:44 i have this strange thing and i don't
83:47 know if it's my visual cortex doing
83:48 something weird with chemicals
83:51 but for any of you have felt like
83:56 um how do i say this you've had dream
83:58 paralysis where you wake up and you
84:00 can't move
84:01 and i've told you this a couple times
84:02 i've had this feeling i haven't had this
84:04 happen in a while and i'm actually
84:05 excited to have it happen again because
84:06 i know it will
84:07 where i feel like there's a being over
84:09 me watching me
84:11 i initially interpreted it as a
84:13 threatening thing and then i finally
84:14 realized no one's ever hurt me in this
84:16 state
84:18 and when i talk to people feel like they
84:20 say they've been alien abducted
84:22 my first account interviews with these
84:24 people way back in the day
84:27 they said this was happening to them and
84:29 it's the pre-curves that are being taken
84:31 somewhere but this is me waking up in
84:33 the morning not waking not in the middle
84:35 of the night
84:36 most of the time i remember it's always
84:38 bright
84:40 but i will close my eyes and i have
84:43 a feeling well i have this visual
84:46 information that up in my upper left
84:48 hand corner like just behind my
84:51 peripheral vision there's a light on
84:54 in the room so here i'm in blackness of
84:58 my bedroom i close my eyes and there's a
85:01 light
85:02 behind me i don't necessarily get the
85:05 feeling that anyone's
85:06 there when this occurs it's just a
85:09 really strange thing
85:11 it would be if you were to take you know
85:14 someone were to say can you see my hand
85:15 now can you see my in it because you
85:16 have about a 220 degree view
85:18 out of your eyeballs and you can only
85:20 see 3d in the front
85:22 because you have both eyes contributing
85:23 to the image but once you go to your
85:25 peripheral it's absolutely 2d and your
85:27 frame rate again on your peripherals
85:29 about twice the frame rate you have in
85:30 front of your face
85:33 fun experiment i've said a couple times
85:35 if you've got a ceiling fan turn it on
85:36 look straight at the blades it's blurry
85:38 now look to the right or left where you
85:40 put the blades in your peripheral and
85:41 you'll see them spin
85:42 smooth as glass it's a mind-blowing
85:44 experiment
85:46 so i don't know what would be going on
85:49 there i don't know if something is
85:50 stimulating
85:52 my visual cortex in a chemical way i
85:54 don't know if it's
85:55 uh it doesn't appear to change if i move
85:57 my head
85:58 you know i don't get closer to it if i
86:00 look more to my left it's just there
86:03 but it will happen you know once a week
86:05 at least it's just a funny little weird
86:07 thing
86:08 so if anybody you know if any of you
86:10 know why that occurs
86:11 um throw it at me but anyway
86:15 if you have been to
86:15 deepthoughtsradio.com that's where you
86:16 can find all the other episodes and
