00:35 two deep thoughts today I thought I
00:39 would just enjoy the new backyard here
00:42 the new studio it's all been cleaned up
00:44 beautiful family that kima did this they
00:50 thrown this advertisement on my lawn I
00:53 gave him a call and this wonderful
00:55 person answers the phone I schedule it
00:58 they come by give me a good price and
01:02 today
01:03 McCain they brought their whole family
01:05 it's like a family mom dad and two kids
01:09 just an amazing job it's fantastic what
01:13 day and night and they did it with love
01:16 too you can just tell how they did it so
01:19 I did this cueing on episode of the
01:21 special report and I went over pretty
01:23 good and there was a time when I used to
01:28 brought a big picture article once a
01:30 year was sort of a diagram of what's
01:33 going on according to moi and this was
01:38 back in sort of 2008 to 2012 era son
01:42 finally decide to come out so a lot of
01:45 times it's the big picture that we're
01:46 missing and it's the big picture that we
01:48 want and one of the things that ends up
01:51 happening at like say a smoke lounge is
01:54 we get someone new in and you can see it
01:58 on their face the angst of oh god I
02:00 really want to know what's going on I
02:02 feel very insecure about what I do or do
02:05 not know about the world and I just need
02:07 someone to come in and say it's gonna be
02:10 it's cool you're all right
02:12 there's some things we need to pay
02:14 - no need to panic at this stage very
02:19 few things in life do we need to panic
02:20 about even in the most horrific
02:24 situations panic doesn't ever help right
02:27 it doesn't help part of what we trained
02:32 our soldiers to do is to endure the most
02:35 horrific things with a level head right
02:40 but what how do you start breaking down
02:43 a big picture well the back in the day I
02:47 used to draw one completely and the way
02:50 I did it was to divide up the agendas
02:53 that are inside the United States of
02:54 America again that's where the show is
02:57 being greeted and then I would have a
03:00 little annex I'd column for how we are
03:04 infiltrated from the European banking
03:08 cartel and I want to say to my European
03:10 listeners this goes for you UK folks
03:13 which includes our Scotland fans and
03:15 Irish fans
03:18 I'm never pointing those terms at you
03:21 personally there's nothing to do with
03:23 you guys I wish there was a better way I
03:25 probably should just drop European
03:28 banking cartel and just say banking
03:29 cartel so just so you know I think that
03:36 the thing that's exciting to me is that
03:37 Europe is waking up and you know we have
03:40 our dish bags to live the United States
03:42 of America and we know where they live
03:43 we know over they own property and the
03:46 second that we can get the charges put
03:49 together and feel like we're doing the
03:51 right thing
03:53 we can go NAB them and hopefully you'll
03:55 have the same opportunity in your
03:56 backyard q and on has announced several
03:59 times that you know the Rothschild
04:02 family is being compressed let's just
04:05 say selling off property that is worth
04:08 hundreds of millions of dollars for
04:10 virtually nothing you know land in
04:13 Europe is in my estimation of everything
04:18 I've ever heard from friends at own
04:19 property what-have-you is so much more
04:22 rare it's a tiny place every country is
04:25 small compared to the you know like
04:26 China you
04:27 States of Russia so seeing them sell-off
04:32 giant estates for nothing is interesting
04:41 but the big picture let's think about
04:43 this what's the most important element
04:45 of your life I would say your physical
04:49 and mental health you need your body to
04:52 be extremely detoxified and pure and
04:54 back to the prehistoric man era because
04:58 that's what we that's when we were
05:01 balanced you know this notion that you
05:04 can just move around the world
05:05 willy-nilly and not pay a consequence is
05:08 absolutely ridiculous if your genetics
05:10 are from China that then all the
05:14 indigenous fruits vegetables and animals
05:16 in that area are designed to cater to
05:18 your body configuration use your African
05:24 then everything in that region is for
05:27 you except your down the line so if you
05:30 come from Africa and you move to like
05:32 you know Utah you're probably way out of
05:36 the pocket of the nutritional cycles
05:39 that will keep you healthy on a
05:41 season-by-season basis right most human
05:44 beings eat one food in the winter one in
05:47 spring one in summer one in fall and
05:49 then the cycle repeats but we think we
05:53 can just up and move ourselves from
05:55 perhaps an organic world to a big fancy
05:58 city and start eating Big Macs and
06:00 Kentucky Fried Chicken and everything's
06:01 gonna be okay it's not gonna be okay but
06:07 it's one thing to be strangled away from
06:09 nutrition right because right now in the
06:11 world we have to pay to get back to the
06:14 70s when everything was organic when
06:18 there was no Monsanto poison company
06:20 glyphosate GMO food that is in every
06:23 single fake news magazine out there and
06:26 every fake newspaper out there telling
06:28 you how if you deny its health without
06:31 knowing anything about it then you're a
06:35 conspiracy theorist you're a denier and
06:37 it should be noted and I haven't
06:39 mentioned this in a long time
06:40 the employees of Monsanto refused to
06:43 have GMO food in the cafeteria of any
06:46 one of their outlets because they know
06:48 what it does to animals they know that
06:51 it sterilizes human beings among other
06:56 things but that's sort of the indirect
07:00 way to keep you losing your mind losing
07:03 your health right we're gonna strangle
07:04 your ability to be able to afford or
07:06 find healthy foods the second half of
07:11 the equation is to program your mind to
07:14 believe you need medical institutions
07:16 for absolutely everything that goes on
07:19 when you live in a small town you hear
07:23 the stories about all of your
07:24 grandparents and your parents being born
07:26 in homes with little you know birth
07:28 mothers and stuff nobody went to a
07:32 Rockefeller owned Hospital no one got a
07:35 c-section
07:36 all the kids popped out yeah sure
07:38 wherever everyone Salman anomaly yeah
07:40 but a pretty rare that all the mothers
07:42 died of childbirth no that is one of the
07:47 biggest bunch of [ __ ] lies it's just
07:51 scary you into the hospital to scare you
07:53 into spending money was it 10 to 15
07:56 grand to have a kid when all you're
07:58 doing you're doing all the work right
07:59 the mother is doing all the work she's
08:02 pushing out of her vagina the doctors is
08:06 there watching and saying thanks for the
08:07 10 grand I get I get a peep show and a
08:10 10 grand check it's ridiculous families
08:17 aren't doctor needed that every single
08:18 time they get a cough and a sniffle and
08:20 whatever you go to the doctor go to the
08:22 doctor and get yourself some antibiotics
08:24 and if you just ate right took your
08:27 vitamin C got some Sun I'm gonna tell
08:30 you right now 95 to 98% of all your
08:32 illnesses just vanish don't eat crappy
08:35 food remember the first one to the
08:39 oncologist loses but the third stage has
08:43 to do with laws right legitimizing laws
08:47 of opinion about medical practices
08:50 forcing vaccinations and little children
08:53 before they have a chain
08:55 to wake up and say I never wanted this
08:57 stuff in my body in the first place
08:59 thanks mom thanks dad
09:01 twenty years ago you had an excuse
09:05 there's no internet to speak of I mean
09:07 20 mm-hmm maybe a little bit more than
09:09 that but you know the truth movement
09:11 hadn't really occurred online but today
09:12 the truth movement has been strong for
09:14 10 plus years ever since loose change
09:17 came out in 2005 you should be eating
09:24 red pills every morning and a couple
09:26 black pills I love this new turn the
09:29 black pill that's means you're gonna
09:31 have to eat some serious [ __ ] truth
09:33 that is going to hurt your soul not that
09:36 I want your soul to be hurt but until we
09:38 have nothing to put inside the black
09:41 pill which are the deeds of the
09:44 worshiped politicians and Welty of the
09:46 world and bankers until the sludge
09:50 doesn't exist we got to take those pills
09:53 if you don't like the way it tastes and
09:56 get off your [ __ ] ass and do
09:57 something about it but now they
09:59 legislated the death of our minds of our
10:02 children right they don't give a [ __ ]
10:04 about you if you're 45 years old and you
10:06 got all your scruples and you're never
10:08 gonna die until you're [ __ ] 100 they
10:10 don't care okay they want to kill your
10:12 kids they want to kill your grandkids
10:15 and they want to kill them by zapping
10:18 their brains by poisoning them
10:20 convincing you of course that you're
10:22 doing something good to them I mean they
10:23 love that symbolism reversal I'm telling
10:26 you it's unbelievable taking every war
10:30 we've ever fought and making a person
10:32 feel like they've done something
10:33 patriotic it's not our soldiers fault
10:37 they've been lied to and they're
10:38 trustworthy people that's why they're
10:40 wonderful people they're willing to
10:42 sacrifice everything to go in and and
10:44 throw down for your freedom and I'm not
10:47 suggesting that every single war has
10:49 been without merit you know without need
10:51 to occur once the craziness starts right
10:54 it should never be started in the first
10:56 place you should never be financed in
10:57 the first place but once those [ __ ]
10:59 get financed whoever they are you know
11:01 we do have to protect what we're up
11:04 against
11:05 sometimes
11:06 doctrines get diametrically opposed to
11:10 each other right so health is a big one
11:16 today you have to get clever with it if
11:20 you're a parent in California it's
11:21 extremely difficult Governor Jerry Brown
11:24 should be given all of the vaccinations
11:28 fact every [ __ ] on the
11:30 Sacramento Senate should be forced to
11:35 take all of the vaccinations just as
11:37 quickly as they give it to an 18 month
11:39 old baby which is you know up to 14 at
11:43 one time let's just see how they feel
11:46 let's just do a black mirror on them
11:49 nope whoops sorry about that you just
11:52 took a [ __ ] ton of aluminum and Mercury
11:55 let's see how your brain works in a few
11:58 days here we have a convulsion recovery
12:02 center over here for you then the next
12:05 column is your mental health how do you
12:11 maintain mental health obviously you got
12:14 to take care of the first column which
12:15 is all of your toxicity it's so
12:18 important because you could have the
12:21 will to want to stay intelligent and
12:23 lucid fair and honest and you know you
12:27 want to stay away from depression you
12:29 want to stay away from all those things
12:31 but if your toxified from the biological
12:34 side your mental side is is also a
12:36 biological mechanism your dopamine and
12:39 your adrenaline gotta manage that stuff
12:44 carefully but how do you get let's just
12:47 say your body's fine for the most part
12:49 it's performing well you can eat a Big
12:52 Mac and actually get some energy somehow
12:54 did you're young you're just shredding
12:57 that stuff inside yourself okay so you
13:01 go through K through 12 in the United
13:03 States of America kindergarten first
13:05 through senior year and you're trying to
13:08 get a kind of a bird's-eye view on
13:09 reality well the interesting thing is is
13:14 that the more I study the classes that
13:15 the elders of mine took is I'll ask them
13:18 what classes did you take when you were
13:19 young
13:20 very few of them took existential
13:23 classes meaning classes that weren't
13:26 rooted in our trade skill reading
13:29 writing and arithmetic shop you know
13:34 they forced me to take home MEK cooking
13:36 I did in Massachusetts as a 7th grader
13:40 and I got to high school I I think I
13:45 took it again and then I became a
13:46 teacher's assistant for it's really
13:48 weird I was awesome because I got to eat
13:50 all these cinnamon buns and [ __ ] in the
13:51 middle of the day it was great but I
13:54 learned how to program a computer at
13:56 high school I learned how to write
13:58 properly English I learned a bunch of
14:01 advanced mathematics
14:03 I learned physics I learned astronomy
14:05 soundwaves trig and you know it it
14:09 seemed like what I was learning was meat
14:11 potato stuff but I was able to take it
14:13 to the real world and use I took it a
14:15 can two economic classes that were
14:17 simulating my checkbook every month and
14:20 having to balance it and then you know
14:22 the second class I took from a totally
14:24 different teacher a totally different
14:26 year in a totally different school my
14:29 girlfriend was my wife we had class
14:31 together and we just lived a fake
14:34 financial life had to create a budget
14:36 all that kind of stuff so when you're
14:38 taking academic classes I want you to
14:41 ask yourself whether or not you're
14:43 taking sort of this core curriculum that
14:47 is trade skills there are things that
14:49 you have to use to live a happy life and
14:51 anytime you're in a world that is more
14:55 existential or theoretical just keep
14:58 track of it in college what do kids do
15:01 kids take easy courses right they just
15:05 want to get their credits and go right
15:07 hmm as an employer from time to time I
15:12 can tell real fast who's studied in
15:15 school and who didn't it doesn't matter
15:16 what your credentials are you could have
15:19 a PhD doesn't matter I need you to have
15:23 a lot more than just your focused trade
15:25 skill you need you need communication
15:28 skills written communication skills you
15:31 need interpersonal communication skills
15:32 you need to be able to kind of see
15:34 yourself outside your own body so you
15:36 pathetic alene oh how you impact other
15:38 people's lives within the department
15:40 that you're in let's go back to the
15:43 fundamentals perhaps like we say on this
15:46 show and many other channels say we need
15:48 to learn history don't we because we're
15:50 running a risk of repeating some pretty
15:52 bad [ __ ] over and over and over again
15:55 you know what's happening right now on
15:58 the planet the big picture is is that
16:00 socialism which has been this laughable
16:03 experiment from everyone who's ever
16:04 tried it
16:05 and this would be royal families who
16:09 have seen it and they've got all the
16:11 archives of having tried to do this and
16:12 banker families who have seen it and
16:15 tried to do it it's a fiasco and it
16:17 never works now does that mean we need
16:20 to be individualist sand capitalists and
16:22 no one cares about anyone you know next
16:25 door because you're so taking care of
16:27 yourself no we don't need that either we
16:31 need to care about each other and see
16:32 ourselves in the full ecosystem but
16:36 there's all kinds of ways of being
16:37 social I'm being social by making this
16:40 show and putting it out there you have
16:42 rarely seen anyone in the backyard with
16:43 me while I make the show but it impacts
16:45 a lot of people and people take it into
16:47 their social circles and your comments
16:49 come in to me and it helps me and in
16:52 fact my social circles but what do we do
16:55 with all this revised history as one
16:56 tries to become intelligent what do we
16:58 do with all this pop science that is
17:00 essentially closing the minds of kids
17:02 every single day well one of them is for
17:06 us and one of them is for our kids and
17:08 our grandkids doesn't matter how old you
17:09 are
17:09 if you know what kid who you can
17:11 influence some of the coolest [ __ ] I
17:15 have ever learned has been from some
17:17 weird guy in my neighborhood in my
17:19 school and you just learn stuff you
17:23 learn to question things right and I'll
17:27 tell you you want to learn as much as
17:28 you possibly can in terms of options of
17:32 what might be true I'd say be very
17:34 careful setting your you know putting
17:36 your foot down saying this is absolutely
17:37 true and the reason for that is you
17:41 could be wrong you could be onto
17:43 something but the way that you've spun
17:45 it isn't correct
17:47 and so you want to be you know be
17:49 careful because it could be embarrassing
17:50 to you or what have you and could also
17:53 keep you locked out of the truth right a
17:56 little key little latch it key keeps a
17:58 door shut and that door has the little
18:00 tiny kernel and the Zelda game that will
18:03 get you to the next level of actual
18:04 truth it's one of the mechanisms we use
18:07 in Hollywood when we write scripts a lot
18:10 of times a good script will make you go
18:12 for something a hundred percent and then
18:15 we know we don't want to actually make
18:17 the obvious thing the truth at the end
18:20 of the script but we want to make you
18:22 think that that's it but the entire time
18:24 most of you who like mysteries we hope
18:26 you'll be suspicious you'll be looking
18:27 at all the other factions so sometimes
18:29 getting to the false conclusion contains
18:32 the fact that we'll get you to the right
18:34 conclusion that's how life works in
18:37 general I'm just gonna tell this story
18:40 it really doesn't have anything to do
18:41 with the big picture I just keep
18:43 thinking about it and I think the moral
18:47 of the story is everything's not binary
18:52 in the world this sort of pass or fail
18:54 idea that truth truth is definitely true
18:58 or false sort of thing but in terms of
19:01 cataclysmic sky is falling sort of takes
19:04 on things I run into people every once
19:06 in a while I had a client called me the
19:09 other day and it was funny the clients
19:11 on the phone and they're totally calm we
19:14 had just updated some web properties for
19:15 them and then they put on the phone this
19:21 guy that they dragged out of a Trader
19:23 Joe's he's a buddy of theirs that PAC
19:25 practice grocery bags for a living and
19:27 they've kind of given him this role in
19:29 pretending to be what he is and so he
19:34 comes in he's on the phone and we just
19:37 upgraded the website and it's been a
19:39 long time since we did it so he did it
19:41 and we know there's little bugs and
19:44 stuff and so the the clients like yeah
19:46 yeah you know this one needs to be
19:47 changed that's not our thing but pop I
19:49 got it uh any other guys like in this
19:51 total emotional swing of everything he's
19:54 like oh god this sketch engine you know
19:56 it was almost like he was like you
19:58 changes without calling me who the [ __ ]
20:00 are you dude
20:01 and the funny thing was is he kept
20:03 trying to add all this emotion to just
20:05 things he needed a report okay this page
20:07 is missing remember this page was hidden
20:09 and we use it for this and that and this
20:10 and I'm like oh yeah yeah sorry it'll
20:12 take me two seconds to get it fixed I
20:13 mean literally on the phone within 30
20:16 seconds it was back up no big deal but
20:19 he's doing this chicken little sky is
20:20 falling thing because in his brain to
20:23 get his way which is what he's really
20:25 interested in is he wants to say I'm big
20:29 and I'm important and boy you should
20:32 consult with me you know the president
20:34 should call me before he makes any
20:35 decision sort of thing I was a kid I was
20:39 in seventh grade Massachusetts and we
20:42 used to get actual this once before but
20:45 I got this Duty of sweeping the floor on
20:50 one of my hours of school anything to
20:54 get our class was always fun I was
20:56 failing seventh grade I utterly flunk
20:57 seventh grade I was getting five FS
21:00 every quarter to put that in perspective
21:03 for you up until that point I did fine
21:06 right after that I did great but this
21:09 was a different school different
21:10 regiment and man I don't know I just
21:13 gave up so I would you'd have to meet
21:16 the janitor the head janitor of the
21:17 school and the basement by the boiler
21:21 room the more I think about this summer
21:23 I think it's like it could be kind of
21:25 creepy but just to give you a
21:28 perspective of how you can go with the
21:32 flow I think this is what the moral the
21:34 story is and it's not exactly related
21:35 this I apologize but I think it's kind
21:37 of interesting and funny but we would go
21:39 down there and there must have been four
21:41 or five kids down there and we're all
21:44 coming like I don't know we're all
21:46 coming to pick up our brooms and we're
21:47 all just kind of meeting and he's kind
21:50 of telling us what hallways to do but
21:52 this guy was sitting there I'm gonna say
21:55 he was late fifties early sixties you
21:58 could tell you been in janitors whole
21:59 life he just was a part of the school I
22:03 mean that in a complimentary way but he
22:06 was sort of just kind of numb and
22:08 exhausted he didn't have any bubbly
22:10 personality hey kids it's all take our
22:12 pants off he's not that kind of guy
22:14 he was just a stoic kind of guy
22:19 he would drink he would drink on the job
22:22 he drink Jack Daniels and what was just
22:27 fast this is 1981 somewhere in there
22:30 8281
22:32 maybe 82 and he he had a big bottle Jack
22:36 this is before Jack got all [ __ ] up
22:37 Jack is [ __ ] now guys if you think
22:40 you're drinking Jack Daniels
22:41 you better be drinking thirty-year-old
22:44 Jack if you want to taste what it really
22:46 tastes like back in 8 now it's like some
22:47 soupy Coca Cola it's just bad he's just
22:51 shitty headaches so we have these Dixie
22:54 Cups and if you guys know what Dixie
22:56 Cups are they're the ones that you put
22:58 in your bathroom the little tiny cups
22:59 and you fill it up and you could just
23:01 you drink the water out of it you crunch
23:03 it up you're throwing the trash right
23:04 and he's pouring us Jack Daniels well
23:09 you know I know what alcohol is but I my
23:11 parents don't drink that much and at all
23:13 really and I'm like okay and this guy is
23:18 pouring it almost like he's almost like
23:20 a semi-coma guy right he's like so quiet
23:24 and he moves like slothy and he's not he
23:28 has no alarm on his face that he's
23:29 feeding you know seventh-graders Jack
23:32 Daniels and we're all coming down to get
23:34 our Jack and then we're gonna go we're
23:37 gonna go mop the school I didn't know
23:40 that sounds utterly atrocious and
23:43 irresponsible and horrible but I have a
23:46 very fond memory of this process and I
23:50 don't think I did it that many times it
23:52 seems like I did it for about a month or
23:54 so and then for whatever reason it
23:55 rotated out maybe because I got so many
23:57 apps I lost the privilege of it [ __ ] I
23:59 don't know you're like oh you drank Jack
24:03 Daniels that's why you were feeling yeah
24:05 I feel like I did this once a week or
24:08 something but we drink our jack and he
24:11 would just gotta be staring at the floor
24:13 and we just fell look at each other
24:15 isn't this cool and we go out and I got
24:17 a [ __ ] buzz on and I'm just mopping
24:20 and the funny thing is is now that I'm a
24:23 grown-up I guess you could say I know
24:25 that when someone drinks alcohol you can
24:28 so I had to be going back to class
24:31 smelling like a [ __ ] drunk it's
24:34 really funny and for me kind of the mall
24:39 the story is you know we lived we made
24:45 it through all this weird stuff and as
24:47 long as the intent of this old man
24:49 wasn't to touch us or be crazy yeah he
24:54 just shared his world with us and I
24:58 can't get that guy's face out of my head
25:00 I can't get the experience out of my
25:02 head cuz it's so bizarre it's like that
25:06 if you ever seen Apocalypse Now it's
25:07 like when Charlotte heir was at Martin
25:09 Sheen goes around the corner and all of
25:11 a sudden there's a he's in the jungle
25:12 he's been through [ __ ] hell and back
25:14 he turns the corner in this boat and he
25:18 finds a playboy stage and all these
25:22 people having this celebration are
25:24 flying in like a USL thing we're at the
25:29 Dallas Cowboy Cheerleader there and
25:30 she's doing a striptease thing and he's
25:32 just like go figure man I'm in the
25:35 middle of the desert chasing this guy
25:36 Marlon Brando's character and I bump
25:39 into a titty show in the middle of the
25:41 jungle it's sort of like that you know
25:44 next column over the Illuminati book
25:49 that was written in like the 1640s it
25:52 was called Illuminati that's where the
25:53 name comes from we did not give them
25:55 that name they gave it to themselves and
25:57 then we're all a bunch of tinfoil hat
25:59 people if we happen to use the world
26:01 that word that they used to the name
26:03 that they used to brand themselves with
26:05 they talked about the stretch in the
26:07 squeeze the stretch in the squeeze has
26:11 to do with financial repression it has
26:15 to do with limiting your currency
26:16 limiting your ability to get any and
26:18 once you get some they squeeze you with
26:20 taxation to bleed it out of you all
26:26 right so imagine a farmer in the 1850s
26:28 in Kansas having kids in their house
26:32 well then they don't have to pay a bunch
26:33 of goddamn money to have a child because
26:35 it's a natural process you know all
26:37 these overpopulated destitute areas of
26:39 the world how do you think they have
26:40 their kids or they're going to
26:41 Rockefeller institutions now they're
26:43 going out to the to the garden and
26:46 they're squatting and these child's
26:48 falling out while a couple other women
26:49 help out I mean aren't even there so you
26:53 don't need that stuff you know do it in
26:56 pools that's the cool the birthing pools
26:59 well how is that how is the stretch in
27:02 the squeeze modernized to the 21st
27:04 century well I would say it's become
27:08 such a multi-faceted Fabrice Fabrice
27:10 Shea egg that it's almost difficult to
27:14 discuss even a majority of them 51
27:18 percent all I can say to help speed up
27:22 the process is that we are stuck on a
27:23 bunch of amenities aren't we how many
27:25 people need a cell phone to exist
27:27 everybody in the modern first world
27:29 countries you just have to how many of
27:31 you have home phones and you're under
27:34 fifty a very few very very few why pay
27:38 an extra amount of money for some phone
27:40 that sounds like [ __ ] for one thing
27:42 because they compress the signals so bad
27:43 a lot of folks can't afford to buy a
27:46 house so they rent a house they rent an
27:48 apartment which means you're never gonna
27:49 build up any equity I mean even if you
27:53 did buy a house just like Robert
27:54 Kiyosaki says homes went from assets to
27:57 liabilities technically speaking on
27:59 paper they were always liabilities until
28:02 you actually paid off the principal but
28:06 to see the house next door when they
28:07 moved in in 1963 they told me they paid
28:09 thirty six thousand dollars for that
28:11 house all right I know that sounds like
28:16 a lot and things cost a lot more back in
28:17 those days but they own that house
28:19 within 20 years owned it it went from
28:22 the liability column to an asset column
28:24 they still live there they don't pay
28:26 anything but property tax but then
28:28 there's property tax right and that [ __ ]
28:30 can be messed with like crazy they can
28:33 raise property tax with a prop you know
28:35 they can say Oh baby seals are being
28:38 clubbed in the North Pole we need to we
28:40 need to increase our taxes here in
28:42 Southern California and people will just
28:43 go okay there's all let's talk about you
28:47 know white privilege and racism and all
28:50 this other stuff in this modern age but
28:51 what's really interesting is that
28:53 communities raise
28:55 property taxes to keep out low-income
28:58 families we don't want to turn into one
29:02 of those neighborhoods do we well
29:07 typically there has to do with privilege
29:09 has to do with racism when you do that
29:12 I'm willing to bet you wouldn't admit
29:15 that to your friends but in the end
29:17 you're like yeah I totally agree with
29:19 that one I don't want a bunch of
29:22 primitive people living in my
29:23 neighborhood stealing all my [ __ ]
29:26 partying until 4:00 a.m. in the morning
29:29 because they have no empathy for anyone
29:30 else yeah you might go along with it in
29:39 the United States of America prior taxes
29:42 on wages is actually unconstitutional
29:44 our forefathers figured this out a long
29:46 time ago wrote it into the Constitution
29:48 in 1913 the sixteenth Amendment is
29:51 falsely ratified in this country
29:53 inventing income tax on your wages
29:56 however if there's if you watch Aaron
29:58 Russo's movie freedom to fascism he
30:01 proves beyond the shadow of a doubt
30:03 including interviewing one of the former
30:04 heads of the IRS there's not a single
30:08 law or statute in this country that says
30:10 you have to file personal income tax at
30:13 all you don't there was Tobacco Firearms
30:17 and corporations that's how America paid
30:20 for everything prior to our personal
30:23 taxation but what happened a bunch of
30:25 bankers went to Jekyll Island see bills
30:28 still STI ll for details on this he's
30:32 got a couple I think it's bill still
30:34 calm but he has all the movies you need
30:37 to see to get this in fact a movie on
30:39 Jekyll Island which I highly recommend
30:41 corporations were tired of getting taxed
30:43 the bankers owned the corporations and
30:45 so they set out to say look why don't we
30:48 just tax all the people they're so
30:51 goddamn stupid right now they don't even
30:52 know it's in the Constitution United
30:53 States so we can just tell them that
30:55 this is gonna be an amendment to the
30:57 Constitution and they'll buy it and
31:00 they'll start filing their taxes they
31:02 can they're being patriotic and in the
31:04 end the corporations or at all the
31:06 exemptions for their own
31:08 taxes and so corporations stop paying
31:10 almost instantaneously even individuals
31:13 could form little corporations around
31:15 themselves which you can do to this day
31:17 in the United States of America you form
31:18 an LLC around yourself you make everyone
31:21 pay your LLC ein number instead of your
31:23 social security number
31:24 same exact goddamn thing but you get to
31:27 take all your expenses first reducing
31:28 your taxable income and if you do your
31:32 thing right you'll pay almost no taxes
31:34 at all pretty cool right but that's how
31:39 the people shoulder the entire country
31:42 and that's how corporations are immune
31:44 from taxation I'll give you an example
31:48 of the lunacy of Taxation there's this
31:51 big push by a bunch of liberal
31:53 know-nothings to get Donald Trump's
31:56 taxes because corporate taxes and his
31:59 personal taxes well these things are
32:02 filed by certified public accountants
32:05 what we call CPAs in order to become a
32:09 certified public accountant you must
32:11 swear that you are going to try and get
32:12 every legal exemption slash deduction
32:17 for your clients that is your job that
32:20 is what you're sworn to do but in this
32:23 country we have a bunch of kids that
32:25 have no clue and I mean [ __ ] you walk
32:29 into the room of their brain when it
32:31 comes to this subject matter and it is
32:32 vacant it is the most sterile clean room
32:34 of clean rooms it's not a particle in
32:36 there of knowledge about any of this
32:38 stuff and so they hear that he's a
32:41 boogeyman and so they want to prove that
32:44 he's the tax evader right so his is one
32:50 of his tax returns was released for the
32:51 Trump Organization his company and it
32:54 showed that he paid virtually nothing
32:57 now what he did to get his deductions
33:01 was he gave the money to his employees
33:03 the group of people that get taxed are
33:07 people because of the 16th amendment and
33:10 our [ __ ] ignorance to follow it right
33:12 so the highest tax bracket you can put
33:14 money in to pay your country and be
33:17 patriotic is to get it out of your
33:18 company and give it to individuals
33:20 that's how it gets taxed
33:22 the most if you keep it and use all your
33:25 corporate deductions for things like I
33:26 hey I bought a computer about a new
33:28 building about a new crane then all that
33:30 disappears and no one gets paid anything
33:34 Apple Computer
33:35 something I have watched for a very long
33:37 time now simply called Apple Apple Tim
33:42 Cook's personal liberal agenda company
33:45 when they finally blew up with the iPod
33:48 this is before the iPhone they went from
33:52 a five dollar stock to a stock screaming
33:56 over a hundred dollars
33:57 they went from making barely a few
33:59 billion dollars in gross sales to making
34:01 tens of hundreds of billions of dollars
34:07 if you're not an Apple fan then you
34:10 won't know that all the Apple fanboys
34:13 huddle around the fire when the
34:16 quarterly announcements the earnings
34:18 announcements are read by Apple nine to
34:21 five Mac comm using numbers and letters
34:23 is a great place to go to get this
34:27 information okay when they were making I
34:31 believe one of the years it was they
34:33 made forty five billion dollars in gross
34:35 sales all right what do they pay taxes
34:40 on forty three million dollars that's a
34:44 fraction of a fraction of a penny right
34:48 one percent a forty five billion dollars
34:51 is four hundred and fifty million
34:53 dollars and they paid one percent on one
34:58 percent less than one percent of one
35:00 percent at forty three million dollars
35:02 where is the outrage well the truth of
35:07 the matter is is that's what's going on
35:08 at every corporation Oracle Samsung you
35:13 know American divisions it happens
35:16 everywhere because that's what the
35:17 accountants are supposed to do but again
35:19 they do pay their employees right they
35:22 pay their effect Toyota which is
35:24 Japanese base pays American employees
35:26 and so even though even though Toyota
35:30 might get a tax break they're still
35:32 claiming a gigantic deduction
35:35 to the people and then we're stupid
35:37 allowing our taxes to go up allowing us
35:41 to file these taxes in the first place
35:43 which is what the Tea Party movement was
35:45 all about right
35:46 Tea Party movement was formed out of
35:47 about 3500 X IRS agents who finally
35:50 figured out around the same time that
35:52 Aaron Rizzo released his movie freedom
35:55 to fascism which you can watch for free
35:57 on YouTube Aaron who mysteriously dies
36:00 of stomach cancer right after he makes
36:02 the movie they formed a political party
36:05 and said you know this is all [ __ ]
36:07 we've been lied to didn't seem to change
36:11 anything did it but going back to column
36:14 2 for a split second as I always say on
36:16 the show if you don't study and I've I
36:19 said I saw like a broken record but this
36:20 is a good big-picture source you got to
36:23 get the big gigantic book it's about an
36:26 inch thick but it's like 10 by 11 it's a
36:30 huge book physically Charlotte is Ruby's
36:32 book that deliberate dumbing down of
36:33 America you can watch some YouTube
36:35 videos of her talking about what's in
36:37 the book she's not trying to sell it to
36:39 make a bunch of money she really just
36:41 wants the information out there but our
36:43 educational system is written by the
36:45 corporations that want us dumb as a bag
36:49 of hammers it's the truth like I've said
36:53 several times on this show you could go
36:54 from K through 12 and get a four-year
36:57 degree in business and you will only
37:00 know how credit cards work because of
37:02 your personal experience outside of
37:04 educational systems they don't teach you
37:06 about compound interest on a card you're
37:08 never to know it's this weird little
37:10 mystery this weird little Club of oh I
37:13 got you right so the stretch in the
37:16 squeeze has to be monitored has to be
37:18 educated into people's minds these are
37:20 all techniques that have been handed
37:21 down they're enforced by governments
37:26 police weird agencies now the tax that
37:33 is actually legal is called a portion
37:35 taxed and that means a flat tax the
37:38 Constitution made a provision if
37:40 everyone's taxed the same exact rate you
37:42 can turn one on is that the Forbes guy
37:47 that has run for president a few times
37:49 he tried to have a flat tax of 15
37:51 percent flat tax be very careful with
37:54 that because it is constitutional
37:56 and if you can't pay it for whatever
37:58 reason does you're stretched too thin
38:00 with your income and your expenses your
38:03 wants and your needs they could do
38:06 anything they want to you under
38:08 constitutional law but again if we take
38:13 the corporations that we enable in this
38:14 country and made them pay their taxes
38:18 without tax breaks well we wouldn't need
38:20 any income tax at all if we'd stop
38:23 starting wars all over the goddamn world
38:25 as the again Thor's hammer for the
38:29 bankers right Thor's Hammer's got a
38:31 handle on a big piece of steel on the
38:32 end the handle goes back to the bankers
38:34 it goes back to the monarchs it goes
38:36 back to the oligarchy who run this
38:38 planet who we allow to run this planet
38:41 out of complete craziness but the big
38:43 steel at the end that's that's America
38:46 and those are the bodies and the souls
38:49 of our citizens so and they swing it and
38:53 we go over to Middle East and we pound
38:55 down seven different countries and kill
38:57 leaders and steal their [ __ ] we get
39:00 blamed for it
39:01 we live with the sin of it all we have
39:03 the PTSD as a result of the handle that
39:07 goes back if we just simply stop using
39:10 the hammer and dismantle the hammer and
39:12 said look we're no longer attached to
39:13 you yeah someone starts to threaten our
39:17 sovereign land there's gonna be a
39:19 firework show that will put any previous
39:23 shock and awe moment to bed but until
39:27 then we're gonna mind your own goddamn
39:29 business
39:30 which i think is a good fourth column
39:33 our attitude towards the rest of the
39:35 world how do we get a perception of the
39:38 rest of the world we read newspapers
39:43 online all right all source back to
39:48 Reuters and AP at least that's the way
39:52 the baby boomers do it and because
39:55 they're old and they've got all their
39:57 stuff figured out they have bigger
39:59 checkbooks than most of us they're no
40:02 longer in the risk game
40:03 no longer trying to figure out what they
40:05 want to do they figured out what they
40:06 can do and they're just in that circle
40:09 most of them just sitting there homes
40:11 and become xenophobe scared of the
40:13 outside world agoraphobic can't go
40:15 outside it's too much of a mystery it's
40:17 too scary they look at their fake news
40:22 and they develop all these psychoses and
40:25 fears and they're willing to sign a
40:29 check to anyone who will promise that
40:31 they that that they can get rid of the
40:35 threat it never goes away does it
40:39 because of the way the world is
40:41 configured there's a map you should
40:45 probably start building in your brain
40:46 now but you already have one if you're
40:48 avid listener of this show take a
40:51 country any country especially first
40:54 world countries and zoom in on them in
40:57 your head and then you know how you have
40:59 call-outs little lines that pull off
41:01 from the country and say well what you
41:04 know between between every country there
41:06 is an attitude in Great Britain
41:09 you have England which is but it right
41:11 up against Scotland and there's a bunch
41:14 of opinions right there Scotland wants
41:16 to be independent of the Queen of
41:18 England they have voted to do so but
41:21 just like all the other fraudulent votes
41:23 it keeps coming in that they want to
41:25 stay they want to stay a serf to England
41:28 when Scotland has everything they need
41:30 to be completely sovereign again the
41:32 majority of Scottish people want out
41:34 that's the truth the politicians have
41:37 gained position within Scotland because
41:41 they are loyal to England there's
41:43 probably a lot of invisible financial
41:45 kickbacks that are going on but they
41:47 have nothing else they just get their
41:49 status right and that area of the world
41:52 has always been a class status class
41:54 structure system politicians are better
41:57 with than other people right police
42:00 officers are better than some other
42:02 people it's not that police officers
42:04 have engineered this for themselves they
42:06 inherited it all right so it's not a
42:07 slam on any one individual but it
42:10 happens it happens in America you get to
42:12 carry a gun around constantly
42:15 hey believe me when I go to a restaurant
42:19 and there's four cops in uniform eating
42:22 a dinner you know I feel pretty secure
42:24 there's a lot of firepower over there
42:26 there's a lot of training over there
42:27 anyone comes in and tries to pull [ __ ]
42:29 and I'm just gonna get down these guys
42:31 will take care of it or girls whatever
42:35 you have Ireland there's a bit of water
42:38 between Ireland and England man if they
42:40 ever had a battle between the two of
42:43 them terrorist groups supposedly right
42:47 the IRA that every single country
42:50 especially America has all these lines
42:53 as soon as you draw a line between
42:56 America and England on that line you can
42:59 write a little bio about what we think
43:01 when the line goes towards them with an
43:03 arrow pointing at England that's our
43:05 opinion of them and when the arrow comes
43:06 back towards us it's their opinion of us
43:08 and believe me every single day of the
43:13 year
43:14 these these relationships have spin PR
43:20 groups that maintain the narrative on
43:24 all the countries and how they perceive
43:25 each other it's a chess game and we're
43:28 not paying attention we think it's all
43:31 happenstance and serendipity instead of
43:36 thinking yeah this is actually
43:41 orchestrated as of this recording
43:44 there's a big deal with Russia having
43:48 one of the you know it's some sort of
43:52 British Intel and England is saying that
43:57 Russia poisoned him with some
43:59 radioactive isotope this is definitely a
44:03 weapon that Russia has admitted using we
44:05 have done it too
44:06 everyone's done it who's got a
44:07 first-world intelligence agency but not
44:10 they admitted or not Russia's like hey
44:13 man we didn't kill this guy and why
44:16 don't you prove that we did because
44:17 we're right here we want to be involved
44:19 with the investigation as a matter of
44:20 fact because we're taking a big hit all
44:22 of our ambassadors and all the
44:25 representatives are being kicked out of
44:26 all the other countries because you're
44:28 claiming that we
44:29 play this dirty game that we even need
44:31 to play this dirty game right now at the
44:34 banking global level and again I'm
44:38 preaching to the choir now you guys know
44:40 this but it's something that you need to
44:41 explain to other people anyone who's not
44:45 in part a part of the world banking
44:47 system the petrodollar system is an
44:51 enemy of this shadow government this
44:55 deep state that's running the world and
44:57 losing total control at an alarming pace
45:00 that is so awesome right now that's soap
45:03 we can put the last nail in this coffin
45:05 here we've got a few nails to go we're
45:08 not at the last nail yet until I start
45:11 seeing arrests in the United States of
45:12 America according to Q's map of those
45:15 who will be arrested and for the reasons
45:18 that Q has lamented in code we're
45:22 nowhere close to the last nail Syria
45:27 Syria yeah they got a dictator but if
45:31 you study Syria this guy protects all
45:34 religions he is loved by his people he's
45:38 super educated speaks six languages when
45:40 he does a press conference he talks to
45:42 everyone in the room in their native
45:44 language to the best of his ability he
45:47 studied in England as I understand it
45:49 and he just lacks any of this ego that
45:52 he's sort of accused of but he doesn't
45:57 do the World Bank money system and
45:59 that's pissing off the families that get
46:03 their way all the [ __ ] time so this
46:06 whole al Qaeda Isis invasion of Syria
46:09 it's all just a cover story to disable
46:14 Assad from running his country and so
46:19 now he's like look I'll have elections
46:20 and we can switch leaders and stuff but
46:22 right now we're under attack
46:24 and so when you're under attack whoever
46:27 knows the most about the history of the
46:29 country is usually the most equipped to
46:32 defend against an attack because if you
46:33 switch horses in the middle of crossing
46:36 a stream that's the old cowboy analogy
46:39 if you're gonna fall off just chill out
46:41 until you get across this
46:42 and then you can do your whole
46:45 renegotiation of who's on what horse and
46:47 who's in charge and so there is logic
46:51 and keeping him there until this all
46:53 resolves but of course there's a great
46:54 relationship between Syria and Russia
46:56 and Russia also doesn't play the game
46:59 with the rural banks Boris Yeltsin
47:03 signed them into the world banks and
47:05 they raped Russia the estimates I've
47:10 heard is that they just organically lost
47:12 about 30 million of their own population
47:14 because everyone was suffering so much
47:16 and it still has a lot of things wrong
47:20 with it that are trying to be fixed but
47:23 it's a big gigantic country fairly
47:25 limited population I think there about
47:27 160 million or so I apologize if I had
47:30 that number grossly off but that's the
47:32 last time I'd heard it their subsidies
47:36 to have kids again Iran doesn't play the
47:40 World Bank game although maybe that's
47:42 changing so there's been this huge thing
47:45 of go after Iran go after wrong go after
47:47 wrong Libya Muammar Qaddafi wanted to
47:51 create a gold-backed in our well they
47:53 went in killed him stole his goals those
47:55 silver took that probably to Europe paid
47:59 off a few people like the Obamas and the
48:00 Clintons and then which would be a tiny
48:03 percentage of that money and then they
48:05 took the guns and gave it to a new group
48:07 called Isis so the story on the Vegas
48:11 shooting you guys always want me to talk
48:14 about this kind of stuff
48:14 believe me I talk about it on my
48:17 personal time but again there's so many
48:20 people doing great jobs covering this
48:22 kind of stuff that I don't really feel
48:26 like I need to chime in I just don't I
48:28 feel like it's being covered beautifully
48:29 by other people but this the story that
48:33 has emerged is that Saudi Arabia lost
48:37 their king a few years ago and he had
48:41 several sons of course and one is a a
48:47 was supposed to be genetically the next
48:49 one in line due to his age his relation
48:52 and all this other kind of stuff but his
48:53 father realized that he was sort of a
48:55 corrupt
48:56 guy and so he chose a different son his
48:59 favorite son a son that saw the future
49:03 they can play chess really well let's
49:06 just put that it's a metaphor so Donald
49:10 Trump announces he's going to run for
49:11 president and the bad prince who didn't
49:15 get picked by his father starts
49:17 attacking Trump in his Twitter account
49:20 and then Trump responds saying oh you
49:24 used all your daddy's money to get all
49:25 your status he'd ever had to work a day
49:27 in your life and you're you're coming
49:30 after me good luck but the night of the
49:36 Vegas shooting the crown prince the
49:39 favored son and the bad son were in town
49:43 because there was a secret arms deal
49:47 show going on showing him some stuff
49:49 that he could purchase and it was the
49:52 night that the bad prince was gonna kill
49:53 his brother there's an amazing
49:57 surveillance video of the crown prince
50:00 getting escorted out of the casino that
50:01 he was in he was in the basement looking
50:03 at something he was in very casual
50:05 clothing but it looks like he has I
50:09 think without a doubt probably about six
50:13 to eight sort of Delta Force level guys
50:16 weapons fully drawn and that very
50:19 specials you know special forces way
50:22 escorting him out of this place and it's
50:24 one camera after another after another
50:25 you can see this video and you know the
50:27 patrons of this scene are like holy [ __ ]
50:29 you know they're just playing slots and
50:31 walking across the little walkways and
50:33 all of a sudden here comes as this will
50:35 entourage guns fully drawn people
50:38 telling them to get the [ __ ] out of
50:40 their way literally the bad brother
50:43 calls the good brother and says hey I
50:44 got a helicopter in the area because
50:46 they own the four floors of the forest
50:48 season that this supposed shooters on
50:50 all right which is this the next thing
50:52 that's about to occur in that evening
50:53 and he says I got a helicopter ready
50:57 want you hop in it and I'll get you out
50:59 of there and the protection detail that
51:02 night was smart and said no no things
51:05 you're gonna exit on ground and no one's
51:09 gonna know
51:10 where you are and you're gonna get home
51:11 safely tonight which is what actually
51:13 occurred the latest theory is that there
51:18 was another helicopter that was planned
51:23 to shoot the helicopter that the crown
51:26 prince was going to get into out of the
51:27 air but he didn't get in the cover story
51:32 was going to be that this guy on what
51:35 the 32nd or 33rd floor of this Four
51:39 Seasons which again those floors those
51:41 four floors that these the bad prince
51:43 owns he was going to blame that guy for
51:47 shooting the helicopter out of the sky
51:48 killing his Crown Prince brother when it
51:53 didn't go down well they just shot up
51:56 the concert probably out of pure anger
52:00 or maybe it was just a start shooting
52:02 the crowd because we need to create this
52:04 diversion and if the helicopter takes
52:06 off shooter now this guy too I will
52:08 simply say it was the guy inside the
52:09 hotel
52:10 the autopsy report on the dude in the in
52:11 the hotel was that he died about 12:30
52:14 that afternoon so he died several hours
52:16 before this event took place and that's
52:18 according to the coroner I've met people
52:21 who met several people now who have been
52:23 at that event very techy people have
52:26 taken several cell phone cameras of that
52:28 evening and synchronized all of it on
52:31 the sort of a master-detail screen and
52:33 they started synchronizing the big
52:35 six-foot
52:36 plumes of fire coming out of the
52:38 helicopter and synchronizing it with the
52:42 distance between the helicopter and the
52:44 crowd and where they were hearing
52:45 ricochets off the ground and you'd see a
52:47 fireball they'd wait the proper amount
52:49 of you know split seconds and then ping
52:51 off the ground so the helicopter was
52:54 contributing to the deaths which is why
52:56 you get multiple shooters helicopters
52:59 perfect because then you don't have any
53:01 side a book sort of Book Depository
53:02 problem now be interesting because
53:06 rounds produce shells right once the
53:09 bullet comes off the shell the shell is
53:11 then ejected from the gun unless you
53:13 have a very special situation hooked up
53:15 in the helicopter it's going to be
53:17 dropping lots of 308 or five five six or
53:19 over the hell your
53:20 using on this gun it has to match the
53:23 caliber of the guy who's being blamed
53:25 inside the hotel now all indications are
53:27 as the guide in the hotel was a piece of
53:28 [ __ ] - he was a gun runner he was a
53:31 human trafficker his brother got busted
53:33 for pedophilia very quickly after the
53:34 event may be pretty easy to frame people
53:39 in these days didn't it one of the
53:41 things one of the things that's going on
53:43 a lot in the internet which bothers me
53:45 and I catch my friends doing it all the
53:47 time is that someone will finally come
53:50 to their senses and realizes that we're
53:52 friends with Russia we're friends with
53:54 China we're friends with a lot of our
53:57 arch enemies right Kim Jong Un's coming
53:59 around and so they'll say oh there's
54:01 never gonna be any you know war between
54:03 us so I'm like yeah you're right
54:04 you praying attention this is all
54:06 [ __ ] you didn't even if there is a
54:09 little skirmish it's probably nothing
54:11 more than a diversion for something else
54:13 but I don't think there's going to be
54:14 any okay that could change but then a
54:19 couple sentences down in the same
54:20 paragraph of their speech they'll start
54:22 demonizing these countries and saying
54:24 how were near some sort of conflict with
54:28 these people according to my research
54:31 China has an attack anyone else
54:33 aggressively meaning nothing's going on
54:36 and China makes an attack on someone for
54:37 over 400 years they've had a hellish
54:42 civil wars they've lost tens of millions
54:45 to their own lunacy internally but they
54:47 haven't ggressive Lee attacked anyone
54:49 else in a long time if you study Lenin
54:52 and Stalin and Khrushchev there was a
54:56 lot of vibrato right a lot of chest
55:01 puffing it seemed like Lenin was pretty
55:03 cool but Stalin was kind of crazy as
55:05 hell Khrushchev was trying to play a PR
55:07 game which he played fairly well up to a
55:08 point
55:09 until the space race started
55:11 disintegrating they were ahead at the
55:15 beginning and then they couldn't get to
55:16 the moon and died and you know we all
55:18 know the story cold war ends and the
55:19 sort of late 80s early 90s
55:22 Gorbachev kicked out yeltsin's put put
55:24 in he sells out his country then we have
55:27 Vladimir Putin Putin gets a bunch of
55:30 [ __ ] because he was an ex-kgb guy he's
55:33 I had seed right was a Chavez in
55:36 Venezuela same situation ex drug lord
55:40 can't be a good guy well it's one of
55:44 those things you takes one to know one
55:45 in some areas of the country the rush is
55:47 different right right Russia was a
55:49 socialistic country back in the USSR
55:51 days right
55:53 which means this you might wake up and
55:56 go god dammit I want to be a movie
55:58 director and I'm just gonna study
55:59 everything movie directing and you go to
56:00 film school and you talk to people and
56:02 you make a bunch of short films and you
56:04 finally get the job and you become a
56:05 movie director that's how America works
56:07 when you lived in Russia in the 80s you
56:12 were evaluated right you have mandatory
56:16 military service so they start looking
56:17 at how you can handle your physical
56:19 prowess you're tested mentally once they
56:23 find out you're smart you're sort of
56:26 this physical badass you know Putin's
56:28 this definitely rough and tough guy he's
56:31 a judo expert he's got all kinds of
56:33 mixed martial arts training they have
56:37 their own style of fighting over there
56:38 so he gets appointed into the military
56:41 gets appointed up to the KGB that's
56:43 where they tell him he has to work
56:45 because of his prowess and if you're in
56:47 Russia and a place where it is very
56:50 tough to live in the 80s in Russia
56:52 because they were really struggling and
56:54 they're losing their population right 30
56:56 million people sort of disappeared out
56:59 of their population you know it's not
57:01 like they were starving to death they
57:02 just didn't have money to procreate you
57:04 know it's just a rough world and you get
57:06 a job in the KGB and you make a ton of
57:08 money and you got status well [ __ ] who's
57:10 gonna turn that down you wouldn't you
57:14 would thank your lucky stars in in a
57:15 poverty-stricken country you got one of
57:17 the best jobs in the whole country but
57:18 we blame that guy like he chose to be in
57:21 this evil organization which by the time
57:23 Russia fell in 91 you know they went in
57:26 and looked at all the spy information
57:28 the paper version of the NSA and they
57:29 were like oh my god these [ __ ]
57:31 were spying on everybody so Boris
57:34 Yeltsin they'd gone Christmas Eve or New
57:36 Year's Eve or something like that of
57:38 1999 going into 2000 he appoints Putin
57:42 as his replacement with the caveat that
57:46 there's
57:47 full immunity for ever for the Elson
57:49 family no one related to the Yeltsin
57:52 family or Boris Yeltsin himself could
57:55 ever be brought up on crimes obviously
58:00 you only do that if you have a ton of
58:01 [ __ ] on you so he you know he dies
58:03 probably of liver explosion Putin has
58:08 got a mess on his hands he's got a
58:11 financial mess on his hands he's got a
58:13 social political mess on his hands his
58:15 country has been suffering for decades
58:17 they lost the Cold War he knows that he
58:23 was into a lot of industry by that time
58:25 and yeah you know the big accusation is
58:29 is that he's parlayed a bunch of
58:30 construction kickbacks to his to one
58:33 little tiny corporation out of like 40
58:36 39 of them taking 99 percent of the
58:40 profit and he gets a little bit of it
58:41 and they say he's one of the richest men
58:42 in the world and yeah he does own a lot
58:44 of big properties in weird locations but
58:46 they probably don't cost a lot he gives
58:47 away you know $10,000 watches the little
58:50 kids when he goes to town any one point
58:53 in time that guys wearing anywhere
58:54 between half a million to a million five
58:56 on his body and just jewelry and badass
58:59 suits very articulate very stoic very
59:04 calm gives huge press conferences to his
59:06 people and if you just listen to the
59:09 questions that he answers there's no
59:13 sign that he is saying hey if you ask me
59:15 a hard question you don't get to come
59:17 into the press conference they can ask
59:19 him all kinds of stuff Hebrew you can
59:21 find more about the military status of
59:24 the world just watching Boris seltzer
59:26 sorry excuse me
59:27 Vladimir Putin interviews anyone else in
59:29 the world he talks about our covert
59:33 missile shields he talks about our jets
59:35 and our boats and what he knows about
59:37 them and he makes it public and then he
59:40 makes his version of it public and a lot
59:44 of people know that they've had fake
59:45 parades and stuff with fake missiles and
59:47 stuff but again you know they've been
59:51 doing that for years do you really need
59:54 to haul a real ICBM down the street and
59:56 during a parade no you keep them in the
59:59 ground ready to go
60:01 and you just build sort of mock looking
60:02 things for parade purposes how many
60:07 times have you been at a parade where a
60:09 guy has a wooden rifle it has no barrel
60:11 it's painted to look like a gun and the
60:14 dudes twirling it around and holding it
60:15 up and doing fake things with it we know
60:18 they're fake but we know it's
60:19 celebratory it's just to say it's
60:21 commemorating real guns that have played
60:24 a big role in stabilizing the world but
60:27 the next column over of the big picture
60:30 is a real tough one to discuss I'm gonna
60:34 go into metaphorical mode I'm sure this
60:38 will be demonetised we'll see what
60:39 happens here
60:40 I won't go shooting up YouTube as a
60:43 result of it I promise you that we have
60:47 these events that happen all around the
60:49 world don't we events where people are
60:52 perceivably hurt mortally in a lot of
60:57 cases mean they no longer are alive
60:58 after the events we have individuals
61:02 that are employed as actors prior to
61:06 these events and then they show up at
61:07 these events actors are moved around to
61:10 these events over and over and over
61:12 again some females have showed up to
61:14 five different events one of the females
61:18 will show up as a mother in one event
61:20 being interviewed you know and they're
61:23 claiming to be indigenous citizens of
61:24 these regions where these things occur
61:26 and all sudden shall show up as an
61:28 attorney in a completely different state
61:30 for the accused Patsy that's a little
61:36 weird you'll be an event and everyone
61:39 who talks on camera and does a really
61:41 poor job at being probably one of the
61:44 worst those beans to ever live you'll
61:47 find their IMDB page in a different
61:50 country sometimes you'll find out
61:52 they've made a bunch of movies
61:53 a little bit parts here and there a
61:55 little indie films even the the people
61:58 that conduct these situations that are
62:03 accused of hurting other people have
62:06 made films before kids who graduated
62:09 high school five years ago show up to
62:11 high schools and pretend to be students
62:14 that one's interesting it's a technique
62:19 it all relates to the fact that America
62:23 is one of the last countries and
62:27 definitely the last superpower on this
62:28 planet to allow their citizens to bear
62:31 arms our Second Amendment of our
62:34 Constitution of our Bill of Rights
62:35 Second Amendment was created to protect
62:37 the first and it was not meant for
62:40 hunting it was meant to literally
62:42 protect an uprising from the government
62:46 to its people no beautiful thing is is
62:49 we haven't really seen any of this in
62:50 any major way since it was created so
62:53 that's the beautiful truth of the
62:54 situation yes we've had natural
62:57 disasters where the Second Amendment has
62:59 been put aside they go door to door and
63:02 grab guns it's interesting there when
63:05 just looks the other way
63:06 we have gun-free zones in America how
63:09 that's even legally possible and why the
63:11 president United States would allow that
63:14 to happen I mean it should be an
63:15 executive order that simply says Second
63:17 Amendment provides these rights it's not
63:20 up for negotiation or interpretation and
63:23 you get to have concealed carry but you
63:26 got to do your six months worth of
63:27 training you get to have this that this
63:29 that this sorry guys sorry you
63:33 snowflakes you fraction of a percent of
63:35 people to get all the goddamn press that
63:38 one otherwise but one of the greatest
63:41 big-picture things that's been going on
63:43 for a long time now and it's it's really
63:46 grown into complete lunacy because these
63:48 events that were occurring initially we
63:50 believe were entirely fraudulent meaning
63:52 anyone that was said to have been harmed
63:54 except for the Patsy of course which is
63:56 usually terminally executed we think
64:01 that a lot of people that were said to
64:02 have suffered you know a fatal wound
64:06 were not real people or they were actors
64:09 or they end up showing up a lie of some
64:11 other place this has happened over and
64:13 over and over again more than four dozen
64:15 like that have occurred now recently in
64:19 the last year so we have what's called a
64:21 hybrid the hybrid is where they really
64:23 do hurt people and kill people at these
64:26 events
64:27 and then they literate with all these
64:29 actors that say that it went one way or
64:31 the other confirming the patsy
64:33 confirming the fear of the Second
64:35 Amendment and now we've had idiots you
64:40 know go out there and campaign against
64:41 the one thing that allows them to be the
64:45 [ __ ] that they are right and the
64:48 irony of this whole thing is that when
64:49 people are given the opportunity to move
64:51 to countries where there are no guns
64:53 they don't take it people that are for
64:55 things like Sharia law will say I'm
64:58 gonna go hitchhiking across the Middle
65:00 East to prove that it can be done and
65:02 these are good people and unanimously
65:05 they are raped and murdered during their
65:07 little escapade never gets on the front
65:11 page of any press right it's all fake
65:14 news we can't figure out that one you're
65:17 to love your enemy you're to
65:18 institutionalize yourself into the
65:20 Stockholm Syndrome on a day-to-day basis
65:22 right in case you missed it in case
65:25 you're having a problem sort of telling
65:27 people why America needs to keep their
65:29 Second Amendment
65:30 let me make sure you understand this and
65:33 I made a whole episode in season one
65:34 called gun controllers you could take a
65:36 look at it if America well actually
65:42 sorry let me tell you now is the exactly
65:43 way I did in my first show if Europe for
65:47 instance were to suffer the same slings
65:50 and arrows they suffered that forced our
65:52 forefathers out of Europe to create this
65:54 country America would go rescue that
65:57 country meaning if anything like Hitler
66:01 ever happened again let's just go with
66:04 the official history on that guy there'd
66:08 be a war again and we would go
66:10 heroically liberate Germany from whoever
66:14 would be incarcerated there citizens
66:16 doing racist things you know like oh
66:19 you're this race you go into that camp
66:21 that ever happens again we would be
66:23 there until it was over until either we
66:26 expired or they expired but now America
66:31 is a mega power right one of the saddest
66:34 results of World War two is that Germany
66:37 is not really allowed to have a standing
66:39 army
66:40 I think I have a few soldiers and that
66:42 kind of stuff they're not really allowed
66:43 to be a superpower ever again I don't
66:46 know why that just last forever right so
66:49 today it's no contest we would save but
66:55 now if America loses its guns then all
66:59 bets are off when it comes to
67:00 sovereignty and when it comes to
67:02 individual freedoms once the great
67:05 protector is gone as you know it was
67:08 either together as we are as Americans
67:10 or as delusional as we are as Americans
67:12 the one thing we do seem to understand
67:13 no matter what the IQ is in this country
67:16 is freedom it's a real basic idea right
67:20 but if America loses its guns this world
67:24 would transform very quickly into some
67:27 dystopian horrible thx 138 very quickly
67:32 you will answer to soldiers every day of
67:35 your life you will answer to your local
67:37 police every day of your life you will
67:38 beg for permission to do the most basic
67:40 things that you can do today I watched a
67:44 video today about a subject matters been
67:47 going on for a long time and you know I
67:50 don't really know enough about it to
67:52 have some gigantic opinion about it I'm
67:55 trying to get myself educated but
67:56 there's a there's a ruler of Dubai who
67:59 has a bunch of kids and his daughters
68:04 are sort of have been fed up for 18
68:08 years they live in sort of penthouse
68:12 cages according to them they're not
68:14 allowed to go do what they want know
68:19 what's going on and Dubai on the outside
68:20 narrative is that he's allowing women to
68:22 drive and everything's getting much more
68:24 modernized so there's a lot of kudos
68:26 going on but his daughters are saying
68:27 well that's not what we're allowed to do
68:30 and he has a daughter that went into
68:33 hiding
68:33 her name is Latifah just like the rapper
68:37 except she's a real princess of a real
68:39 king of Dubai and it was interesting she
68:42 said that when she was in her mid-teens
68:44 she tried to escape her father's grasp
68:47 and this is where it's I think very
68:50 revealing
68:51 she said I I was naive I just went to
68:54 the border I thought I could cross and
68:58 then after I crossed the border I would
69:00 just be free it would just be leaving a
69:02 prison now obviously her father is
69:05 laughing all the way through this whole
69:07 thing and she gets captured and put in
69:09 prison for three and a half years and
69:10 tortured on I wouldn't say it
69:14 unspeakable levels but it was pretty bad
69:16 and she said you know she was in the
69:18 dark and solitary confinement for days
69:21 and days and days but she said I did I
69:24 didn't know what the world was like
69:26 because I didn't have the Internet at
69:27 all I mean the internet existed she said
69:29 but I didn't have any access to it so
69:31 she goes I didn't know what a border
69:32 looked like I didn't know what the
69:34 outside world looked like I didn't know
69:35 what freedom really was I had no idea
69:37 that my dad could chase me all around
69:40 the world
69:41 I could go to Guam and he would have
69:42 guys on me in two seconds she's now
69:45 escaped again you know who knows if she
69:49 got to a safe place or she got captured
69:51 again she got murdered
69:53 we don't know she said when she got home
69:55 from prison and went back to her
69:57 biological mom that her mom had no
69:59 sympathy for and just said you know what
70:02 you just experienced which was 3 and 1/2
70:04 years in a solitary confinement prison
70:06 getting beaten every single day for up
70:08 to five hours a pop that's child's play
70:12 if you do it again you're gonna get a
70:15 way worse than that does their mom if
70:20 you ever watched the movie that's gonna
70:21 sound like a silly analogy but it was a
70:23 very huge eye-opener for me when I was a
70:25 kid it was about 16 17 years old prints
70:28 released a movie under the cherry moon
70:30 it's just a fictional old
70:31 black-and-white film very old story
70:34 archetype but there's a moment when the
70:37 rich girl who's trying to break free
70:38 from her father's grasp and this movie
70:41 yells at her mother and I said you know
70:45 I want to marry who the hell I want to
70:46 marry I don't want to marry this
70:47 douchebag you know corporate son that my
70:51 father wants me to marry I don't care to
70:53 merge two empires together and her mom
70:57 just says she says you know she says to
70:59 her mom you know you you really don't
71:01 understand what I feel like and her
71:02 haunts looked at her and said something
71:04 to the effect of
71:05 we're all in pain you just don't know
71:08 what yet meaning her mom has cowered
71:11 down into this system and that sounds
71:14 like what Queen Latifah's mother did
71:17 I mean imagine you're you're a woman in
71:20 the Middle East and you get to marry a
71:21 king I mean Jesus it's got to be some
71:24 huge bump of life quality right
71:27 so it sounds like from the perspective
71:29 of the mother she may have went from
71:32 probably not poverty or anything but
71:33 went from a lower life class to upper
71:36 life class but then the daughter grows
71:39 up in the perspective of the better
71:42 lifestyle and she sees the next level
71:45 right that's sort of an a beautiful
71:49 mapping typology to what's going on with
71:52 America preserving freedom and
71:54 preserving the Second Amendment to
71:56 protect the freedoms of this world and
71:59 to just put a finer point on it that I
72:01 probably didn't make before my previous
72:02 episode about guns yeah there's not an
72:06 intelligent person on this planet that
72:08 wouldn't like to have not only all the
72:10 guns disappear in this world and
72:12 missiles and bombs and all military
72:14 everything and all police everything but
72:16 then in order to to create that world
72:19 we'd have to run a magic virus through
72:22 everyone's brain to not want to hurt
72:23 each other to make sure that all humans
72:26 that know that they're sovereign beings
72:28 they're people that only common law
72:31 rules this world but we can't do that
72:33 can we so because we have [ __ ] in
72:35 this world we have guns in this world
72:37 and we have protection you know it's
72:40 been noted a million times the
72:42 politicians that Lobby against gun
72:44 rights are the people that run around
72:46 with entourage with you know two or
72:48 three guns per Secret Service agent or
72:51 per you know hired bodyguard to protect
72:54 them oh okay
72:56 you see how that double standard works
72:58 right they're never getting rid of the
72:59 guns to protect them ever because
73:03 they're trying to create a class
73:04 structure over you you've already bought
73:06 into it probably one of the big picture
73:08 things about the Clinton family is that
73:12 Bill Clinton was great as you know
73:14 before you get into the rape charges and
73:16 all that kind of stuff we remember
73:18 90s were very prosperous I made a
73:22 tremendous amount of money beyond my age
73:24 in the 90s I made a man salary when I
73:27 was a kid and the reason why wasn't Bill
73:30 Clinton Bill Clinton had a very
73:33 fortunate thing happen on his watch
73:35 which was the explosion of HTTP protocol
73:38 on the internet which created web pages
73:40 once that occurred the world changed and
73:43 there was a tremendous amount of
73:44 investment in technology to bring that
73:48 into fruition and a lot of us made a
73:49 tremendous amount of money when that
73:51 money went around people got to sell
73:53 their comms people like Mark Cuban Elon
73:58 Musk they made more money than any of
74:00 these products were worth and now they
74:02 have shark shows right they have
74:04 [ __ ] companies that lose billions of
74:06 dollars every year right no I don't know
74:08 these people and maybe they're great
74:09 people I don't know I'm not [ __ ] on
74:12 someone else's good parade but that's
74:14 why we tend to think that era was great
74:17 we also had a bunch of stuffy presidents
74:19 up until that point and you know Bill
74:22 Clinton played saxophone on what the
74:24 Arsenio Hall Show or something he
74:27 loosened up the formula
74:28 he liked openly liked black people that
74:32 was kind of nice so we had all these
74:35 alkaloids for this guy and so instead of
74:37 going from a dark previous history and
74:41 transforming himself to a good guy he
74:44 used all that good fame to do all of his
74:46 shenanigans and they go way deeper than
74:49 most of us knew in the 90s but due to
74:53 cue and on we now know a lot about what
74:55 went on and it's gone it's gotten darker
74:58 and worse the reason why those black
74:59 pills exist you know if there was a
75:03 pharmaceutical company owned by the
75:04 Clintons you could make the black pills
75:06 out of their past by itself right but
75:10 the big picture is about the Clintons is
75:12 that they're the logo on the car man the
75:16 car is made by someone else so there's a
75:18 lot of other players that make these
75:19 horrific moments happen they don't just
75:22 do all the stuff by themselves and
75:25 that's what qa9 keeps trying to tell us
75:27 there's a gigantic infrastructure of bad
75:30 people
75:31 and we have to go after the whole thing
75:32 it's called the deep state it can't be
75:35 stressed more right now that we are in a
75:39 very pivotal moment a crossroads in the
75:42 history of the world what's at that
75:46 billionaire Dan Penna he said two years
75:49 ago he goes if Donald Trump makes it in
75:51 to the presidency of the United States
75:53 he's gonna rock not only the United
75:55 States is gonna rock the world I think
75:59 there are a lot of very wealthy people
76:00 who probably aren't immune to judgment
76:04 but overall they are nothing compared to
76:07 the deep Staters I think a lot of good
76:11 billionaires have made it to their
76:15 billions and they have done what I just
76:18 mentioned they turned more kind to the
76:22 world you know they had to brawl to get
76:24 there and who knows what anyone's
76:26 individual history is I do not but it
76:30 seems like they're trying to stabilize
76:31 this planet well they take you in the
76:34 middle of the negotiation if you come in
76:36 unprepared sure that's the game you know
76:39 may the best man win so the last column
76:44 I want to talk about is this and it goes
76:47 back to my morality episode is that we
76:52 are losing morality in this world
76:55 because the access to information is
76:58 highly controlled we know that for a
76:59 fact
77:00 and I think one of the best ways you can
77:04 get a beat on this phenomenon is to go
77:10 to tmz.com which is sort of a Hollywood
77:14 rag you know it's the who's who and
77:17 who's doing what who's divorcing someone
77:19 who called someone a poopyhead
77:20 at a casino who then turned into a
77:23 gunfight and you know all this frivolous
77:25 horseshit from people that you wouldn't
77:28 allow into your [ __ ] house you
77:29 certainly wouldn't allow them into
77:31 making a decision about your own
77:32 personal life because of how rich and
77:35 famous they are but you have housewives
77:39 and kids
77:39 strung out on this [ __ ] you have guys
77:44 but most of my wearing capri pants you
77:47 know but we have allowed the morality of
77:50 this particular country United States of
77:52 America to sort of be under minded by
77:55 all this fame the swill but is on TMZ is
78:00 making its way towards your children if
78:05 you consume it and you revere it it's
78:07 making its way into your brain
78:08 perhaps this already dug a big nice
78:11 sinkhole in your head everything that's
78:14 going on that website is the agenda of
78:16 your your liberal agenda to disassemble
78:19 this world all these orientation issues
78:22 it's weird one of the things you can do
78:26 that will return control of your own
78:30 brain and start to help you form your
78:34 morality probably based on what you were
78:37 raised with being on your age again if
78:40 you're under 35 it's going to be tougher
78:42 and tougher and tougher is to simply
78:45 remove these arteries from your viewing
78:47 spectrum now for some folks that is
78:50 their absolute bloodline they have
78:52 incorporated these personalities into
78:54 their lives they wake up every day and
78:57 try to find news about these individuals
78:59 because for whatever reason they don't
79:00 have a life of their own so they're
79:02 trying to create one by living through
79:05 this swill my perspective is I think
79:10 fairly robust and when it comes to this
79:13 kind of stuff because there are the
79:16 people in front of cameras to get on TMZ
79:18 and there's people behind the cameras
79:20 that never get on and what's interested
79:23 in hanging out with interesting about
79:25 hanging out with the people behind the
79:26 cameras that you learn about all these
79:27 people in front of the camera you learn
79:29 about their personal lives you learn
79:30 about all their dark secrets and there
79:36 are very few folks that escape the
79:39 darkness when they get in front of a
79:41 camera whether they be actors or singers
79:43 or whatever they've even dragged sports
79:47 people into it
79:49 worship worship worship that's the name
79:52 of the game if you don't worship these
79:53 individuals then why would you go to
79:55 that website you wouldn't you know and I
79:58 think that one of the things that
80:01 happened in the 80s is really
80:02 interesting is that people worshipped
80:04 bands and I think there's always going
80:10 to be a stage when you're excited to see
80:12 something new and amazing someone tears
80:14 a part of electric guitar or whatever it
80:17 was even you know we all we all like
80:19 Schwarzenegger and Stallone and Clint
80:21 Eastwood and all this stuff in the 80s
80:23 but what was interesting about it was
80:26 that we didn't have the Internet to dig
80:27 behind their personal lives the amount
80:30 of people that I meet in my age bracket
80:32 that worshiped various bands of the 80's
80:34 whether they be British pop or rap bands
80:37 or metal bands hair metal bands is that
80:41 fight go down the line and say well what
80:43 were the name of the members of that
80:44 band they might know the lead singer
80:47 they might know Eddie Van Halen because
80:50 he's so good on the guitar but that's
80:52 about it they have to think about the
80:54 bass players name and and they're not
80:56 quite sure that kind of came and went
80:57 and we didn't have this total you know
81:01 immersive we know everything about their
81:04 life we know when they got married we
81:06 know where they got divorced we know
81:08 when they picked up dog poop in the park
81:10 we didn't care because we didn't have
81:13 that information but now we feel like we
81:15 care a lot of people care what happens
81:18 they don't pay attention to the agenda
81:20 this that's trying to be shoved into
81:22 your kids brain they don't see the
81:24 agenda they watch a movie and they don't
81:26 realize that that Hollywood has cowered
81:29 down to these bankers to incorporate
81:31 lines into movies to promote things all
81:35 that's going in your brain
81:36 subconsciously I think it's been
81:39 extremely healthy that the Star Wars
81:41 movies have been detected on the sort of
81:44 liberal snowflake agendas the social
81:49 justice warrior genders how many times
81:50 the movie come out and you say oh my god
81:52 it's just a bunch of social justice
81:53 warrior crap you finally hear that now
81:56 because people are becoming hip to the
82:00 brainwashing that's been injected into
82:02 these films I just watched valerian
82:05 valerian again the city of a thousand
82:08 planets I think is the full name what an
82:10 awful [ __ ] name for a movie
82:11 but Rihanna's in the movie is this alien
82:14 dancer girl and she does this seductive
82:17 dance which luc besson usually has
82:19 nowadays and there's this sort of
82:23 heartfelt line that she speaks when she
82:25 finally starts talking to the main
82:27 character it was anything but a
82:30 superhero which is really funny but she
82:32 says oh but you know I'm this poor
82:34 illegal immigrant in this big town and I
82:38 can't break away from my slave ownership
82:40 because which is Ethan Hawke's character
82:42 which was awful and it was this sort of
82:46 agenda that's going around the world but
82:49 now you should take in every refugee in
82:50 the world now again the funny thing
82:52 about this is she's in a city with a
82:54 thousand different species a thousand
82:57 and somehow she's the only illegal one
82:59 in the whole place the whole foundation
83:02 of this city this this floating city in
83:07 space is that everyone's welcome and
83:09 everyone finds their place but they had
83:12 to pull out this illogical agenda to
83:15 shove it in your face right I haven't
83:19 seen the Black Panther movie but it's
83:20 getting you know it's I haven't seen it
83:22 so I don't know if it's good or bad but
83:23 a lot of my friends who have seen it
83:25 none of which are white have come back
83:28 to me and said our anglo-saxon Aryan
83:31 German British white I should say but
83:34 they came back to me and said you know
83:35 was really interesting was there was a
83:36 lot of segregation and racism in this
83:39 this city where black panther lives it's
83:43 just the way it is and the funny thing
83:45 is they're saying it's not necessarily
83:46 wrong that it's like that it's like
83:48 that's the way it used to be around the
83:49 world you went to Germany and you met
83:50 Germans you went to France and you met
83:52 people who are French and that's why you
83:55 tour to those locations you want to go
83:58 and eat German food you want to go to
84:00 China and eat Chinese food authentic
84:02 stuff that's starting to go away slowly
84:08 but it is no one's proud to be in their
84:12 own country anymore
84:13 and one of the most ironic big picture
84:15 things that's happening for America is
84:17 that everyone
84:20 who doesn't like their their first world
84:23 country which is not very many people
84:24 but all these third world people I
84:25 should say and I don't mean to put a big
84:27 you know racist label on anybody but the
84:30 idea is they want to come to America
84:32 because it's awesome right they want the
84:34 prosperity and the protection of this
84:36 country my friends from Mexico that come
84:38 up here to live they don't want to get a
84:40 read of they want to get away from the
84:41 federales that rough them up their
84:43 police they want to get away from the
84:45 drug cartel wars they want to get away
84:46 from the repressive government ok these
84:49 are their words not mine but they want
84:51 to come here and most of them that can
84:54 understand that or like I will do
84:56 anything to preserve America exactly the
84:58 way it is because that's exactly what's
85:01 wrong with my country but someone come
85:03 over that I don't meet and they're
85:05 they're lured into these agendas to get
85:08 rid of the very foundation of the
85:09 country our Bill of Rights
85:11 that made it appealing to them in the
85:13 first place they want financial
85:17 prosperity but some of them come over
85:19 illegally and don't pay any taxes it's
85:21 all under the shelf cash stuff and they
85:23 sent a bunch of the money back home
85:24 which undermines the economy that
85:26 they're lured to in the first place and
85:30 there are people that will say well
85:32 there's so much to go around there's so
85:34 much to go around looks like ok if you
85:36 have nothing but a catch-and-release
85:37 border policy then how long is that
85:40 gonna last before it all goes away I
85:44 don't know the answer myself I'm sure it
85:47 will eventually go away if it's not
85:49 regulated right and just to remind
85:54 people to there's no cap on you know how
85:59 many people are willing to take into
86:00 this particular country there's just a
86:03 limit per year that's all we have done
86:06 calculations and economic models that
86:08 say this is how many how much we can
86:11 take in in a certain interval of time
86:13 before we start interrupting the very
86:15 viability of the country and itself
86:19 okay respect that and we'll all be okay
86:23 you can't have what you want just
86:26 because you want it right if you don't
86:30 like your country we'll go buy a history
86:33 book from America and figure out how
86:34 it's done anyway I know you feel me I
86:38 know you guys have a lot of comments and
86:40 observations let's see if we can fill
86:42 the comments with some other video
86:45 references and again when you paste a
86:47 video reference in there it sometimes
86:49 it's held for moderation a lot of times
86:51 it's posted but then it's marked to me
86:53 as likely spam and I just view you nine
86:56 times out of ten I know you and I just
86:57 say boom go for it right let's see if we
87:01 can't stimulate some conversation around
87:02 sort of the big picture because it's all
87:04 a perspective in the mind right if you
87:08 have been to deep thoughts radio calm
87:09 please go there's audio video locked
87:11 Facebook page and patreon take care of
87:15 yourself and someone else and I'll see
87:17 you in the next deep thoughts over
87:18 [Music]
