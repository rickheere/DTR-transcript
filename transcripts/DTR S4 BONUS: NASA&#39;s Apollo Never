00:00 [Music]
00:32 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:34 gentlemen today I'm going to record an
00:39 episode they're gonna have fun with
00:42 called NASA's Apollo never so the 50th
00:47 anniversary has come and gone of the
00:50 fake moon landing by NASA in 1969 with
00:58 the the astronauts that continued to
01:02 hang on to the lie that they went to the
01:05 moon probably under a fair amount of
01:08 duress and God knows what other type of
01:12 brainwashing and other tactics watching
01:16 vice president Pence go up there and you
01:22 know take a huge hit off his [ __ ]
01:23 NASA bong and proceeded to attempt to
01:27 blow it up everybody's hole was pretty
01:30 disgusting and like I said in the last
01:33 episode yeah I probably have to do
01:35 something but would you listen to a
01:39 speech about the whole thing it is every
01:41 narrative that is why they had to lie in
01:44 their opinion but now I mentioned a
01:48 little something that stuck with me from
01:50 the last episode and that's what this
01:52 entire episode it's gonna be about those
01:56 of you dig the moon conversation I think
01:59 you'll you'll dig this and it's one of
02:01 these things of let's think about think
02:03 about it this way we know that the the
02:07 press is all controlled because we on
02:10 any one particular day we can cut and
02:11 paste all of the press from all local
02:13 news international news from print to
02:16 web to televised from the UK to the US
02:21 because it speaks the same language and
02:24 you're gonna find the same exact script
02:26 coming out coming out of AP writers and
02:28 other phantom locations to sync
02:30 everybody's story up on a particular
02:32 narrative right that's the big fancy
02:35 word we're using nowadays so here's what
02:38 I want to do with this episode
02:40 let's counter-narrative their narrative
02:43 we need to get on the same page we need
02:46 to say the same thing just like they do
02:48 so that this idea of lucidity and
02:52 correction infects everyone on this
02:56 planet we don't have to agree on all the
02:59 evidence on what it means to have lied
03:03 and a lot of stuff we can but we don't
03:05 have to as long as we get the big idea
03:08 that's gonna be the core of this episode
03:10 the piece that stuck with me is the
03:15 little notion of okay supposedly well
03:22 I'm in the backup we're gonna go first
03:24 and then this other thing will go second
03:26 we know that we're waking up the whole
03:29 planets waking up it is amazing how much
03:34 truth has finally come out to trump all
03:38 the lies and it feels good it's been
03:42 going on for probably 15 years easy
03:48 super accelerating the group of people
03:51 and the number of people and the
03:55 individual locations of people who are
03:57 waking up is awesome and startling and
04:02 incredible the protesters in Paris the
04:07 protesters in Hong Kong the protesters
04:09 all over the place that are protesting
04:11 for truth and not all the stupid fascism
04:14 claiming that they're anti-fascism so
04:17 some good things are going on now
04:20 there's this movement online which is
04:24 commonly referred to as the 17:00
04:27 movement which is 17th letter in the
04:28 alphabet go look that up and they go
04:31 look up the whole movement if you don't
04:33 know what it is but supposedly there's
04:36 some factions that are working with
04:38 various agencies and military
04:41 organisations to help speed up cleaning
04:45 up the not only the swamp but the entire
04:48 evil fabric of this world
04:52 sadly however that exact faction just
04:56 participated in a double double triple
04:59 quadruple cover-up of the fake moon
05:03 missions from 1969 instead of leaving it
05:06 alone they doubled down and said no no
05:10 no this is real so we're faced with the
05:13 dilemma we're really faced with the
05:16 dilemma because what we have done is we
05:17 have exposed the emperor having no
05:19 clothes on and simply replaced it and
05:22 fixed the the notion by taking that guy
05:25 moving them aside and bringing out a new
05:28 emperor with no clothes on and saying
05:29 see this guy has his clothes on that's
05:32 messed up and that messes everything up
05:35 once again we're entering a brand new
05:38 cycle of lying to children of lying to
05:42 people that need to wake up now if we
05:45 could simply quarantine all those that
05:47 believed the hype that believed the lie
05:49 put them in their own continent on this
05:52 planet and then just keep that the you
05:53 know imaginary world then I would say go
05:56 for it because they're clinically
05:58 incapable of figuring out the truth of
06:01 accepting the truth they're gonna be
06:02 stuck in the early phases of kubler-ross
06:04 they'll never get out of negotiation or
06:06 anger or denial and so they'll never
06:11 reach acceptance and perhaps that'll
06:13 break their heart so bad they'll have a
06:15 heart attack and die they're fragile yet
06:19 personified super tough exteriors are
06:23 all a facade
06:26 it's what they wish they were but
06:28 they're not they researched nothing to
06:32 know everything the Providence of an
06:36 ignorant person one more time Buzz
06:40 Aldrin walked out and accepted all the
06:44 glamour and glitz for it now again they
06:47 probably have figured out every way on
06:48 planet earth to threaten that guy and
06:50 perhaps in his delusional old age as he
06:53 tells a little girl that they didn't go
06:55 to the moon as he tells it was a network
06:59 about 15 years ago and live television
07:01 that if soon as they figure out how to
07:03 go to the moon they'll figure out how to
07:04 go to Mars
07:05 a video that's been uber scraped off the
07:08 internet supposedly Jainism has inside
07:11 one of his videos I cannot find it
07:13 during bart sibrel astronauts gone wild
07:16 you've got these astronauts incapable of
07:19 telling the same exact story thus
07:21 proving that they weren't where they
07:24 said they were buz threatens to sue bart
07:28 sibrel why because he thought he was
07:31 getting busted that day he thought the
07:33 whole thing was coming out that day
07:35 later he walks up and punches a bell in
07:37 the face and a lot of people take you
07:40 know they feel puffy inside because of
07:44 it oh man that was so great a liar
07:47 punches a truth-teller in the face and
07:49 were so happy for the liar just like
07:52 breaking bad you should root for the
07:55 meth addict it's [ __ ] up all the
07:56 people and the bald-headed cop is the
08:00 jerk and we're glad he's dead at some
08:02 point I can't remember if he dies or not
08:04 but they reversed the polarity of all
08:07 things all loyalties go backwards
08:10 we've been suckers for a very long time
08:13 and I don't slight anyone for being
08:17 deceived before the internet really
08:20 gained its motion I would say around
08:22 2005 loose change things opened up
08:26 lucidity came out million ways to find
08:28 evidence and it just kept building and
08:31 building it building various
08:33 personalities online for at least a
08:35 little while seemed to be legit until
08:37 they turn into what seems like covert
08:39 agents doing shenanigans in the name of
08:43 the truth movement and now boy to the
08:48 protest protest so much now I'm gonna
08:53 make a prediction then in the true
08:57 aspect of getting to the moon it will
09:01 never be under the name of NASA ever in
09:04 your lifetime they will say multiple
09:07 times that they have been there they
09:10 will fake it they will use incredible
09:12 visual effects that Hollywood doesn't
09:15 even have access to to try and hit this
09:18 out of the park
09:20 they might also simply launch something
09:25 and maybe they do like an emergency
09:29 landing because something went wrong
09:31 maybe they just crash it into the moon
09:33 maybe it just floats out in space and
09:35 there's good whoopsie I guess we should
09:37 probably work on that a little bit more
09:40 but it'll never happen in your lifetime
09:43 in any legitimate way under the guise of
09:47 NASA maybe if you're in your 20s are
09:53 your teens maybe before you're dying of
09:58 old age 80 9100 maybe space force does
10:03 it but you're going to have to see the
10:06 debut of completely unique technology
10:09 that does not exist in the real world we
10:14 need the disclosed world of science
10:16 today we have seen the technology a
10:19 million times in sci-fi shows on TV and
10:21 movies if that stuff ever comes out then
10:24 maybe we have it now let's think about
10:27 the true logistics of pulling this off
10:29 and this is of course is based on the
10:32 fact that moon is on average between 232
10:36 237,000 miles away from Earth at any one
10:39 time and it's elliptical orbit around
10:40 the earth some people naively think oh
10:44 well it was just a Saturn fives problem
10:46 we didn't have enough thrust to leave
10:48 Earth's gravitational pull and you would
10:50 be absolutely correct especially as it
10:52 was recalculated over and over for 10
10:55 years by von Braun but then we have the
10:59 Van Allen belts which are a huge problem
11:00 supposedly Project Orion has solved the
11:04 problem without ever disclosing that
11:06 fact all the missions that have gone up
11:10 have been classified which means it is a
11:13 lie that they have figured this out if
11:18 they went up and touch the Van Allen
11:19 belts is it I mean these things aren't
11:20 that dumb aren't that lethal at all here
11:23 we put this box of tomatoes in there and
11:26 we put them up there and left they're
11:27 still fine I mean they're completely
11:30 fine you can eat them let's let's eat
11:32 them on TV
11:33 they're not microwave they're not mushy
11:35 they're maybe a day old but that's about
11:38 it no problem
11:41 nope all classified because it's all BS
11:46 but that's the other gigantic hurdle you
11:49 have to get through is the Van Allen
11:50 belts even if you had a UFO type ship an
11:52 anti-gravity ship yourself to figure out
11:54 how to build a ship that will fend off
11:57 the most massive electromagnetic
12:00 radiation pole / a belt that comes out
12:05 screaming out of the North Pole then
12:07 distributes and slows down and gets
12:10 weaker at the waistband equator of the
12:13 earth and then accelerates and screams
12:16 back into the South Pole so these
12:19 notions that they tell you where they
12:20 escape through the North Pole in the
12:21 South Pole they took a right-hand turn
12:23 and got through it North and the South
12:25 Pole of any celestial body in space due
12:29 to ether all winds and the into plasma
12:32 interior of any of any stellar body is
12:36 so incredibly deadly once you get up
12:40 there about a thousand miles it's gonna
12:43 rip you to shreds but alrighty but now
12:46 you've got to keep all of these people
12:50 alive in this ship so you let's say you
12:52 solve for the propulsion problem you
12:54 solve for the big slingshot problem
12:56 because that's what your propulsion
12:57 problem can accomplish ok is the ability
13:00 to create ever-increasing elliptical
13:03 slingshot orbit around the earth such
13:06 that you're going to slingshot past
13:08 earth SuperDuper fast too thin somehow
13:10 use the weak gravitational force of the
13:14 moon which is twelve hundred miles in
13:17 diameter to slow down and get in this
13:20 perfect orbit around the moon I mean
13:22 it's nuts it's nuts that they suggest
13:24 that this stuff is so easy and because
13:27 you're not an aerospace person and
13:29 you're not an astrophysicist you just
13:32 surrender your mind to all these claims
13:34 how much of our medicine is completely
13:37 horrible for us but we take it anyway
13:38 because people believe doctors you just
13:42 surrender your mind you surrender your
13:43 body and your soul to these individuals
13:45 sure setting it
13:47 is you know your broken bones get a
13:49 little bit of surgery here someone up a
13:52 Rambo wound or something like that sure
13:54 that's pretty easy stuff curing cancer
13:56 mmm
13:57 still haven't figure out how to do that
13:59 one in the oncology departments all
14:01 around the world and the same BS happens
14:04 all the time
14:05 in the space industry because it is so
14:10 hugely out of your ballpark the Delta
14:13 between their brains and your brains and
14:15 their ability to confuse you is so
14:18 instantaneous you surrender I really
14:21 well that's amazing you're super smart
14:24 how many shows did they put on there's a
14:26 few Twilight zones that did this I dream
14:28 a genius to do this all the time where
14:31 they would portray the actors the
14:32 characters that they were playing going
14:34 into bars going into restaurants and
14:35 they use I'm an astronaut so that was
14:37 actually a really big thing in the 70s
14:40 and the even a little bit of the 80s
14:42 guys would go in and today they do false
14:44 Valor Stolen Valor
14:45 right they pretend to be Navy SEALs and
14:47 all these other things that they're not
14:48 presented pretend to be soldiers in
14:50 general to get women to send them money
14:52 in the mail but the one that happened in
14:55 the 60s 70s and 80s was all about
14:57 bragging about being an astronaut
14:58 because it made all the ladies tingle
15:01 downstairs now what they legitimately
15:04 are usually top Top Gun pilots of some
15:06 sort that's cool but the scientists well
15:12 not so much yeah are they stupid no very
15:16 brilliant in what they do but it just
15:18 may be that they're brilliant in things
15:19 that have no basis in reality and could
15:23 you imagine taking a scientists say
15:24 calculate this calculate this and then
15:26 you get that equation into one person's
15:28 mind and then you're lying to them about
15:30 booster power you're lying to them about
15:32 the effects of what they build and they
15:34 think they've calculated it and tooth
15:37 they go to their deathbed thinking they
15:38 went to the moon that they participated
15:40 in this event that never took place
15:42 again there's a guy in Costa Mesa who's
15:44 the son of a dude who built some parts
15:47 for the Apollo missions he believes his
15:50 father stuff went to the moon and I'm
15:53 not a jerk to tell him that it didn't
15:55 he's gonna die thinking that that's it
15:58 that's the truth you hook him up to 50
16:01 lie-detector tests around the world and
16:03 he is gonna come out on top because he
16:05 believes in imaginary things it'd be
16:08 interesting to find out how many
16:09 Christians could pass a lie-detector
16:10 test with the existence of Christ would
16:14 that be interesting D Christ exists yes
16:16 Oh totally do you know that for a fact
16:19 yeah Oh totally absolutely and they're
16:21 passing but they have no empirical proof
16:24 they just have faith but maybe their
16:26 faith is enough to pass the test and
16:28 therefore you have the millions and
16:31 millions of people who believe it went
16:33 to the moon it's something again as I've
16:35 said many times it is their patriotism
16:37 coming out in a mental physical identity
16:40 symbol it is what they're made out of
16:43 it's a fabric of their system it's
16:45 interesting we got to keep people alive
16:48 in space so then we have to figure out a
16:50 safe way to power everything now
16:53 satellites are powered by nuclear
16:56 isotopes in the form of rods it's like a
17:01 mini nuclear power plane
17:03 it just stimulates the valence on some
17:06 wires they coil them up to juice up
17:09 their output and it keeps the lights on
17:12 inside I'm not sure that works I'm not
17:15 sure that was ever you know theorized to
17:18 be in the limb of the lunar module but
17:20 these things have an infinite batteries
17:22 it's amazing but let's just say we can
17:26 get them to the moon now we have this
17:29 again as I've said several times in
17:31 several episodes we have this impossible
17:33 logistic to test which is disconnecting
17:37 the limb from the lunar module turning
17:40 it around and landing on the moon a
17:42 surface of which we have never touched
17:43 we have no idea if it's soft hard dusty
17:46 quick saying we have no idea we've never
17:49 been there before
17:49 but of course they lied by just dropping
17:52 it down on a crane using big giant
17:56 models of the moon and filming them with
17:58 cameras built on Rails of which they
18:01 have disclosed these props and he said
18:03 oh no that was our test thing or
18:04 whatever no that you're actually looking
18:06 at it's hidden in plain sight right in
18:07 your face the props used to fake the
18:10 moon landing footage of the actual limb
18:12 coming down and really filmed outside
18:13 the window
18:14 and as you know the Armstrongs blown
18:16 smoke up everyone's whole all of this
18:19 sand dust of the moon surface just
18:22 flying away from the bottom of the limb
18:24 but a second they get out and film the
18:26 the legs of the limb they're squeaky
18:28 clean and a little sheath that was
18:31 around that 10,000 pound thrust engine
18:33 is right underneath the limb but they
18:35 started the booster far far away from
18:39 their landing site so that little sheath
18:41 has to come off way for our way it's
18:43 gonna fly away it's gonna float in the
18:45 sky for probably five minutes before it
18:47 comes down and here they come boom
18:49 landing all right so now you're on the
18:54 moon's surface how you gonna get out how
18:59 you gonna be in this thing how you gonna
19:00 get out we're gonna wear how you to make
19:04 sure that if you have any problems in
19:06 your limb especially with the stress and
19:09 impact of landing that's gonna go Kapow
19:11 right somebody weighed in about a year
19:14 ago and said that they had these
19:16 rectangular boxes that crushed as soon
19:20 as they landed that was the way they
19:21 actually absorbed it and that's pretty
19:23 cool maybe they did nothing nothing
19:27 erases the fact that they were coming in
19:29 at a speed okay and anytime you come in
19:34 at a speed those little those little
19:36 foot marks are gonna have those little
19:38 foot pads on the four feet of the limb
19:40 they're gonna skid a little bit it's
19:42 gonna take place it's just gonna take
19:44 place you saw the footage you saw them
19:47 going sideways as they landed they did
19:50 not hit absolute zero and then go blink
19:52 straight down again all those feet have
19:55 been films
19:56 six times a single skid under any one of
19:59 those little doodads I mean they had six
20:01 absolutely perfect landings unbelievable
20:05 ridiculous fiction but now you're
20:09 sitting on the moon you're not in a
20:11 vacuum you're not in a vacuum you're
20:13 being utterly pulverized by the Sun and
20:16 sure the moon does have a Van Alen
20:19 bottle all of its own I don't care what
20:20 anybody tells you it's probably
20:22 proportionally weaker than the one that
20:25 the Sun airside the month of the earth
20:26 house
20:28 just literally dial it down in
20:29 proportionate size because the plasma
20:32 core of the moon is proportionately
20:34 smaller it's going to be kicking at its
20:36 own wave plus earth is going to be
20:38 probably injecting it a little bit so
20:42 there's another lethal belt probably
20:44 getting to the moon which is completely
20:46 overlooked because we don't study the
20:48 science when they make the Earth's
20:49 course I'll be different than the Sun's
20:51 core that is different than the moon's
20:53 core it's so much crap it's the same
20:57 everywhere
20:58 trust me Tesla and Springfield Colorado
21:02 proves that the Earth's core is plasma
21:05 same as the documented core of the Sun
21:09 and you're gonna tell me that the moon
21:11 is a different one Yeah right
21:14 so when I had the two guys from NASA
21:16 tell me that the Apollo missions were
21:18 indeed faked because they were told that
21:21 it was factually only one guy claimed
21:22 that he was told the other guy found out
21:24 that he had basically discovered enough
21:26 science about the radiation in in the
21:29 non Van Allen belt that region of space
21:34 outside the Vardhan belts that it was so
21:36 lethal they were gonna have to cover a
21:38 capsule or surround a capsule it's six
21:39 inches of water and circa 1988 that's
21:42 what NASA figured out to insulate it
21:44 from non coronal mass ejections from the
21:48 Sun so there's any CME's from the Sun
21:51 that hit the moon you're dead you're
21:53 absolutely dead if you're even in space
21:55 when that happens you're absolutely
21:57 fried okay I remember quarter inch
22:01 aluminum that's the only thing that
22:03 protected it that's what the capsules
22:05 are made out of the limb is obviously
22:07 made out of a bunch of tent posts and
22:09 construction board and a bunch of other
22:11 crappy stuff right if you want to see
22:14 something hilarious just go look up
22:15 pictures of the LEM on the moon HD is is
22:20 high-quality as you can and just just
22:23 start zooming in in your web browser
22:25 right hit command + or ctrl + on your
22:27 keyboard and start looking at it and
22:29 you'll start to go oh my god I never
22:33 realized the comical nature of this
22:37 thing it's supposedly landed on the moon
22:42 so these astronauts are just sitting
22:44 there just sitting there with anything
22:47 in each side of the capsule this is
22:49 according to NASA okay I'm just gonna
22:50 throw the science at you maybe they're
22:52 full of crap too but every surface that
22:54 is exposed to the Sun in the limb is 250
22:59 to 280 degrees Fahrenheit the backside
23:03 anything that's in the shadows is
23:05 negative 250 to 280 Fahrenheit I don't
23:08 know why it's so perfectly balanced but
23:10 that's what they say okay how's that
23:13 gonna work out how do you keep you know
23:15 you park your car I just parked my car
23:17 today it was 80 degrees up I drove into
23:19 a parking lot at this company and I
23:21 parked my car had my air conditioner
23:22 down to 71 and it's probably chilling me
23:24 down about 73 i sat there
23:27 I checked the temperature outside in
23:31 fact I think it was only 77 because it
23:33 was fairly late morning I could only sit
23:36 in my car about five minutes before I
23:38 had a problem breathing
23:39 because I started really heating up in
23:41 my car now take the outside of my car
23:45 make it 290 degrees 80 degrees
23:47 Fahrenheit hell let's just cut it down
23:49 to 200 degrees Fahrenheit 150 degrees
23:53 Fahrenheit and I'm just sitting in a car
23:55 now let's take the windshield let's
23:57 replace it with quarter inch aluminum
23:58 let's make the whole car out of quarter
24:00 inch aluminum do you think that would
24:02 make me warmer or hotter I'm thinking
24:06 I'm a I'm a sausage in a tin can just
24:09 dying in seconds man especially at 200
24:12 plus what is it a match it could hold
24:15 about a match starts to strike at 320
24:18 degrees Fahrenheit something like that
24:20 mm-hmm so you need to have an amazing
24:24 air conditioning system inside this
24:26 little capsule so these guys don't die
24:27 plus they're in spacesuits that
24:30 supposedly are about three feet thick
24:32 once they're fully inflated plus she had
24:35 this backpack on it's just gigantic
24:36 backpack weighs a hundred pounds on
24:39 earth all right now a 280-pound
24:43 astronaut on earth according to the
24:45 one-sixth displacement of the moon
24:47 should weigh about 48 pounds that's how
24:51 much they should weigh the limb
24:52 certainly weights something when it went
24:54 on the ground right it didn't sit there
24:57 and bounce around like the astronauts
24:59 did now they're gonna be about 48 pounds
25:03 but as one of the nephews of one of the
25:05 astronauts proved by going to the museum
25:07 in Florida and saying can I measure that
25:09 port right there where these astronauts
25:11 that came out and they threw his ass out
25:13 of the museum
25:15 what was his violation what was his
25:18 violation he want to take a measuring
25:19 tape and measure that door he already
25:21 knows how big it is but he just wants to
25:23 measure it just to make sure that
25:24 something didn't get incorrectly
25:26 documented on paper versus the physical
25:28 bottle replicant one one replicant
25:31 inside the museum they kicked his ass
25:33 out because they know that is a
25:36 vulnerability of their story a three
25:38 foot wide person can get through a
25:40 two-foot door hell a normal man going
25:43 through a two-foot door would be pretty
25:45 crampy wouldn't you say so they have an
25:48 air conditioning problem a heating
25:49 problem all in one all in one
25:51 environment they have the problem that
25:54 their suits are too big to get through
25:55 the door so we're gonna have to
25:58 reengineer all that stuff and as many of
26:00 the listeners have documented those
26:04 suits failed miserably in one of their
26:07 only physical tests in the desert at a
26:09 hundred and sixty degrees Fahrenheit in
26:12 the desert these astronauts nearly died
26:15 tried to test those suits as far as I
26:18 know they were absolutely never tested
26:20 in extreme environments like the moon
26:23 ever ever ever what we gonna do put them
26:26 in an oven at 280
26:28 you feeling okay and then somehow
26:30 they're gonna chill their backs the same
26:32 exact suit you see me right now in this
26:35 in this video for those of you coming
26:36 through audio one half of my face is lit
26:39 the other half isn't so one half my face
26:42 is gonna be boiling away third-degree
26:44 burns and eventually turning to carbon
26:45 and the other ones gonna ice up and
26:47 shrink and I'm just gonna turn into you
26:50 know to face right from the Marvel
26:52 franchise or no the DC franchise sorry
26:55 so you might think well the limb had a
26:57 bunch of protection it had a quarter
26:59 inch aluminum I don't know anything
27:00 about physics or metal and metallurgy so
27:02 I think that's enough to protect it
27:04 against the raw radiation coming in from
27:06 the Sun with no happiness
27:07 on the moon we know there's no
27:09 atmosphere on the moon of any kind
27:10 because when we look at it we don't see
27:13 any atmospheric disturbances there's no
27:16 clouds on the moon right it doesn't get
27:18 bizarrely this idea like there's some
27:21 anomaly swimming across the moon's
27:23 surface and in a weather pattern yeah we
27:27 have our personal hatma sphere that's
27:29 wiggling the images every once in a
27:31 while but there's no evidence there's
27:34 any atmosphere on the moon and I think
27:35 that's probably true but let's say you
27:39 can magically teleport these guys out of
27:41 the two-foot door with a three foot wide
27:42 suit on another outside okay now you
27:47 have the heating and air conditioning
27:48 problem all in one suit now we've had
27:52 several again air conditioner experts
27:55 come in to this show and comment down
27:58 below the amount of energy it takes to
28:00 cool off a teeny tiny room at a hundred
28:03 and sixty degrees down to livable
28:06 conditions and they said the amount of
28:07 power you need is unbelievable you have
28:09 to bring in these big spider boxes and
28:11 huge you know 280 circuits in there to
28:14 do it guarantee in 1969 none of that
28:19 existed in the compressed form for the
28:22 limb or the backpack that these
28:24 astronauts had on their backs
28:26 but what's NASA saying about 2020 for
28:31 2024 they're going back and they're
28:33 gonna stay oh man nothing like doubling
28:35 down on the lie is this gonna be the
28:37 next giant challenge challenger
28:39 explosion this is gonna be the next
28:40 Apollo 13 but nobody comes back alive is
28:44 that the way they're gonna crash it
28:45 they're gonna crash it on the
28:47 president's watch this and they're gonna
28:49 blame it on him for pushing and really
28:51 hard so no one ever pushes the issue
28:53 again Oh meanwhile everything's gonna go
28:55 to Mars just no problem no problem at
28:57 all right never test those Mars
28:59 platforms on the moon absolutely absurd
29:02 thing and if you're new to that there
29:03 you think about this they say they land
29:05 on Mars whenever they want to everything
29:07 goes absolutely perfect okay so you
29:11 build a car and your objectives go to
29:13 Los Angeles from Los Angeles to New York
29:15 City in this car about 3,200 miles
29:18 that's your goal now are you going to
29:20 test it around the
29:21 block first aren't you gonna go to the
29:22 town next door aren't you gonna take it
29:25 through I don't know a hot desert you
29:30 take it up to the mountains and see what
29:31 happens in the cold because going all
29:33 the way across the United States you
29:34 might hit some different weather
29:35 conditions you might get hit by a
29:37 monsoon might get by a tornado who knows
29:39 you should know what your car is going
29:40 to be able to do not NASA they don't
29:43 test anything they defy all logic on
29:46 planet Earth
29:48 so now they're out there and their suits
29:50 and their suits are supposedly with just
29:52 material right just rubber and some
29:55 cloth and some more rubber there they're
29:59 just fine with raw radiation from the
30:01 Sun and they magically float now it's
30:04 amazing if 48 pounds on average are
30:06 magically floating because someone
30:07 submitted a BS algorithm of the rate of
30:12 descent ping 1/6 yeah well watch 2001 a
30:19 Space Odyssey because NASA seemed to
30:20 understand gravity when they were
30:22 coaching Stanley Kubrick in his movie
30:24 when the astronauts or whatever you want
30:27 to call them the Explorers the gentlemen
30:28 that went down to touch the monolith on
30:30 the moon they walked like they would
30:34 have normally walked on the moon about
30:36 48 pounds apiece they have special boots
30:40 that are magnetizing down to the
30:42 magnetism rails until they get levelled
30:44 out again and then they get they're able
30:45 to walk and they walk slowly because
30:47 they don't weigh as much but their
30:49 muscles are obviously going to over
30:51 perform and there's the thing that's
30:54 brought up a lot of times and I've only
30:56 mentioned I think briefly one time
30:58 someone make a fine point in this
30:59 because people have mentioned this and
31:01 this is a great piece of proof rubber
31:03 seals don't work in the vacuum of space
31:05 and they don't work in low temperature
31:08 conditions
31:10 remember the Space Shuttle explosion of
31:12 1986 June January 28th an o-ring chilled
31:18 down to 39 degrees Fahrenheit failed to
31:21 expand failed to keep fuel from moving
31:24 from point A to point B which is its
31:26 purpose and it just spewed out one of
31:29 the sides of one of the boosters and
31:30 Kapow caught fire blew the whole thing
31:34 up killed all the
31:36 we're pretty sure killed all the
31:37 astronauts don't ask Snopes the George
31:41 Soros information network well
31:44 rubber seals are all over this entire
31:47 mission it's all over the rocket it's
31:50 all over the lunar module it's all over
31:52 the limb or the Apollo capsule I mean
31:56 it's the way that the limb and the
31:58 capsule hang on to each other through
31:59 the nose cone no problems it's the way
32:03 that the helmets work on the suits
32:07 mm-hmm again imagine a chrome-plated
32:13 neckpiece boiling-hot
32:16 on one side freezing cold on the other
32:19 side what would happen to Matt I mean
32:21 this doesn't happen in the real world I
32:23 mean on planet Earth right we don't have
32:25 a skillet on a stove where one side is
32:29 to 80 and the other side is negative to
32:30 80 we don't have that I don't even know
32:32 what it would do would it just Bend and
32:35 blow up in my face because one side of
32:36 the steel is gonna contract and the
32:38 other one's going to expand not sure be
32:42 really weird but an ice cube right down
32:44 the center one side vaporizes
32:45 instantaneously the other side extra
32:48 freezes this is what we're talking about
32:53 supposedly the the helmets of these
32:55 astronauts had a gold plating on them
32:57 and so you don't see the the actors
33:00 inside brilliant idea but all of the
33:06 things I'm mentioning is not necessary
33:07 to take you through a new evidence tree
33:09 or an ancient evidence tree that we've
33:11 discussed several times on the show but
33:13 these are the things that they would
33:14 actually have to solve for and I don't
33:18 buy for a second that with the current
33:20 technology you could do it and the
33:23 number one thing in my opinion out of
33:25 all of the amazing tech problems that we
33:27 just mentioned okay there's not enough
33:29 tech in Tesla for these batteries
33:32 they're even the covert batteries that
33:33 the oil companies have bought and
33:35 mothballed to make sure that you
33:36 continue buying oil right there's not
33:38 enough tech in the world to create a
33:40 battery to feel everything that we're
33:42 talking about to keep these these
33:43 environmental kits going to store all
33:45 the oxygen for these guys to run around
33:47 on the moon surface
33:48 forever - you know you know you build a
33:51 you build a little car you unfold the
33:54 thing out of the bottom of this limb
33:56 which wasn't built to carry the thing in
33:57 the first place remember it's like
33:59 nearly was it six hundred seven hundred
34:02 pounds something like that and it's
34:03 supposed to just unfold well guess what
34:05 happens when you exert a bunch of
34:06 caliber energy you start to breathe
34:08 heavy when you start to breathe have you
34:10 starting to suck down a lot more oxygen
34:11 what are you gonna do with that did you
34:13 bring more oxygen for all of your
34:15 jumping around on hopping around because
34:17 these guys bounce around all the time
34:19 ask a scuba diver how much oxygen they
34:22 have and then ask a scuba diver how much
34:25 displacement in the in the form of a
34:27 tank is required to be on the moon for
34:31 several hours 12 hours at a day than two
34:35 days and three days where's all this
34:36 being stored it's not like a submarine
34:40 they can scrub it out of the water you
34:42 can't do it this is why this is not
34:45 gonna happen in your lifetime
34:47 most likely sorry a little drop of water
34:50 on my finger hopefully it's a bird
34:53 taking a piss on me I think I'm starting
34:56 to sprinkle a little bit well the things
35:01 I go through to make these shows
35:02 starting to get rained on I didn't know
35:04 there was any clouds above us at all
35:06 unreal hopefully it doesn't get crazy on
35:09 me so you start to see just the basic
35:12 magnitude of what is gonna have to be
35:14 traversed to make this happen and it's
35:18 not like we don't want it to happen we
35:19 definitely want it to happen we want to
35:21 figure all this stuff out and get there
35:23 and move on I just don't think it's
35:26 gonna happen in our lifetime and I think
35:29 that in our lifetime we need to stop
35:31 lying about it what blows my mind is
35:34 that people can watch the entire
35:36 episodes about this evidence and go into
35:38 cognitive dissidence about each and
35:40 every single smoking gun that is the
35:44 evidence pool against this lie and then
35:47 you could get you know I mean pence I'm
35:49 sure he's a nice guy never met the dude
35:51 probably never ever will maybe he even
35:55 believes that we went to the moon that'd
35:57 make it a little bit easier but to have
36:01 the guy go up there and just go
36:02 this isn't the expert to say we went
36:06 anyone from the agency telling you that
36:08 they win is sort of kind of like a lying
36:11 Cancer Center who kills your relatives
36:14 with chemotherapy makes a ton of money
36:16 off referrals for chemotherapy telling
36:18 you that that's the solution and that
36:20 your loved one only died because you
36:23 know it's just you were meant to be your
36:26 minted be dead we are trying to reforge
36:30 the universe and pure truth on this
36:33 planet but what we're doing is we're
36:34 doubling down on some of the most
36:36 ludicrous crap and let me tell you if
36:38 you can lie about reality at that level
36:42 and again just one piece of technology
36:46 that's inferior for the tasks that it
36:49 needs to perform after one after one I
36:52 mean I don't know how many pieces it
36:54 would take I mean our proofs it would
36:57 take you know Eric Dubay used to do
36:59 those proofs on Flat Earth you do proofs
37:01 on dinosaurs not existing and a bunch of
37:03 other stuff regardless if you believe in
37:06 Nina's stuff it's a neat little exercise
37:08 and so I think that if we were to sit
37:12 there and go one piece of technology
37:14 after another after another that didn't
37:16 function properly or couldn't have
37:18 possibly existed we would have a
37:21 gigantic list but the one thing I got
37:25 side Trek when the rain hit me the one
37:27 thing that I think that we can't
37:29 simulate on earth without a lot more
37:32 information would be the issue of the
37:37 the limb disconnecting from whatever got
37:40 it there and then landing on the moon at
37:43 least the way it's designed we need a
37:44 completely different ship to figure out
37:47 how to do that we need a lot of extra
37:48 fuel to do the very first landing right
37:50 we need to correct and correct and
37:52 correct and correct I'm gonna go check
37:55 my phone to see how bad this is going to
37:56 be
37:59 looks like it's gonna be past this here
38:01 pretty soon but I think about that you
38:04 are a scientist trying to figure out how
38:07 to program a simulator to figure out how
38:09 to land something on the moon not
38:11 getting there is going to have to
38:13 reengineer all of the sciences says we
38:15 can even do a slingshot orbit and again
38:18 you got erase all of the Mars crap
38:20 you've ever heard he got it race it man
38:23 sorry sorry sorry all those pictures of
38:26 planets you see that aren't taken from
38:28 ground satellites I sorry ground
38:30 telescopes and orbiting satellites if
38:33 those exist
38:35 remember Hubble telescope is the Sofia
38:37 telescope that runs out of a 747 sorry
38:40 to burst your bubble there man there's
38:42 no evidence the thing you've been
38:43 washing this space go see the Caltech
38:46 kid that called food from NASA to review
38:49 the database with him alive on the
38:51 telephone and the gown and the other
38:53 side said yeah it's weird there's no
38:54 entry in the international database of
38:57 the Hubble telescope ever launching but
38:59 the repair missions are in there
39:01 [ __ ] weird right but now they've lied
39:06 completely to their own staff about the
39:10 fabric of space they say that there's no
39:13 radiation out there it's a complete
39:15 vacuum the second you leave ER its
39:16 atmosphere okay
39:20 I've set right across the module who
39:24 told me it is extremely lethal to man to
39:27 be out there and then the quarter inch
39:29 aluminum capsule couldn't possibly save
39:32 the occupants of the capsule in free
39:34 space after you escape the lethal bands
39:37 of the rate of the Van Allen belts okay
39:41 I got it from the source guys and I just
39:44 laugh when it doesn't happen I haven't
39:46 had this in a long time but in my
39:50 personal life it's funny because I will
39:52 meet people that roll their eyes when I
39:53 tell them that I had these people tell
39:55 me this as if I'm like some
39:58 attention-seeking guy that's like play
40:00 attention to me I know secret things and
40:02 I made up this whole event you know up
40:05 to that and I you know again the thing
40:07 is is I was told this face to face and I
40:09 listened and I memorized it because it
40:11 was such a shockingly weird
40:12 then in my life but I didn't really pay
40:15 attention to the information until I saw
40:17 bart sibrel movie a funny thing happened
40:19 on the way to the moon I probably didn't
40:22 even see it till 2005 and then my mind
40:25 was blown because it connected with the
40:26 other dudes and I was like oh my god
40:28 I was told this in 1991 and I didn't
40:31 listen I don't know what I would have
40:33 done with that information because the
40:34 internet wasn't around an HTTP format so
40:37 I just would have been sitting there
40:38 smoking I grew up a NASA kid I grew up a
40:43 kid that was you know I'd walk into the
40:45 science class be that kid guy knows
40:47 everything about NASA boom I didn't but
40:49 you know they thought I did so that was
40:52 an alkaloid of mine I did oral report so
40:54 standing in front of class just like I'm
40:55 doing to you right now as a teenager
40:57 young teenager just talking forever and
41:00 could tell teacher one sit down okay we
41:02 got it sit down you get your a for the
41:03 day or whatever so I'm not anti NASA at
41:06 first I'm not exactly happy with the
41:10 overall management of the organization
41:12 as it exists today
41:13 I understand why the astronauts don't
41:16 tell the truth it frustrates the hell
41:17 outta me and it made me gag to watch
41:20 them go up and take their little medals
41:22 for lying it bothers me I mean my fabric
41:26 would not again Buzz Aldrin I would
41:29 never meet my God with the [ __ ]
41:31 record you've got ever ever ever yeah
41:33 they're gonna take away your pension
41:34 they're gonna threaten you whatever dude
41:36 surround yourself with twenty different
41:38 kids with cell phones all live-streaming
41:40 to a million different services four or
41:42 five 4k cameras and just look at the
41:44 cameras and go I'm really sorry kids
41:46 it's not my fault I was forced to do
41:49 this I never stepped on the moon I'm
41:50 really sorry bart sibrel I apologize for
41:53 punch in the face
41:53 I thought you're gonna ruin my whole
41:55 life 20 years ago nope nope it's gonna
42:00 go meet his creator maybe he doesn't
42:02 believe one exists was in season Mason I
42:04 don't know as I'm told 33 and below
42:09 believe in God 33 absolutely does not
42:11 believe in God I don't know what's true
42:14 my grandfather was a Mason in the
42:15 Midwest I tried to figure out I mean
42:18 he's a little tiny town so I don't know
42:19 how much he probably is like a 1 degree
42:21 Mason but they said I can send him 15
42:24 bucks to Topeka and find out what
42:26 the record is interesting to find that
42:28 out but yeah these people watch this
42:32 stuff and they somehow blow the whole
42:35 thing off as long as they can you know
42:38 slope something boy it's true
42:40 not realizing that's a husband-wife
42:43 organization with a guy that has run the
42:46 place forever takes his funding from
42:49 cirrhosis corporation I mean come on
42:51 really and what I here's one thing
42:55 that's a bit a bit of a mystery to me
42:57 why other countries have who seem to one
43:01 America to fail right the EU has no
43:04 hard-on for America they see us as the
43:08 gun-toting freedom-loving obstacle to
43:11 their totalitarian social communism that
43:15 they're trying to install through the
43:16 European Union right okay why don't why
43:22 do so many people in Europe believe this
43:25 is true right barely had anything to do
43:28 with it III don't mean to offend anyone
43:31 but come on it's all American American
43:33 you know gun toting fired pistols in the
43:36 air we made it to the moon thanks for
43:39 the module thanks for this thing's for
43:41 that it's not the Space Station people
43:42 Space Station actually is were you know
43:44 international event not the saturn v i
43:48 mean yeah we had things subbed out all
43:50 over the place too obvious key the scam
43:53 to build in a bunch of different places
43:55 no the space shuttle was fairly
43:56 internationally had a canadian arm and
43:58 you had all kinds of astronauts going up
43:59 from different countries that was cool
44:01 why can't we just be happy with what
44:04 we're capable of doing and I'll say it
44:08 again I've said this several times on
44:09 different shows haven't said it recently
44:11 I don't think but let's just say that
44:15 your daughter your granddaughter son
44:17 grandson or even further down your
44:19 family line is the first astronaut the
44:23 first real human being to put their foot
44:25 on the moon but they're denied that
44:28 alkylate they're marginalized because of
44:31 the lie but it's been done several times
44:34 before them I mean I think we're about
44:37 to go into another cycle of lies with
44:39 this thing and 20
44:40 24:00 there's another cycle of lies
44:42 about this so how many more astronauts
44:44 are we going to add to this line and
44:45 NASA says they're building space
44:47 stations right away though right mm-hmm
44:50 and there's so much Rd going on right
44:52 now to build space stations on the moon
44:54 because we've been there and we know
44:56 what the soil is made out of no we don't
44:58 you ever wonder why they this is a new
45:01 one I'm going to throw at you guys you
45:02 ever wonder why all that space dust
45:04 stuck to the astronauts outfits you know
45:08 after and it wasn't necessarily the
45:10 first mission but it was a little bit in
45:11 the first mission but in the second
45:13 third and fourth man it just got worse
45:14 and worse and worse these guys are
45:16 covered in this suit and it mysteriously
45:19 went from white and shiny to sort of
45:23 black dusty like volcanic ash kind of
45:27 stuff like soot from a fire carbon what
45:33 else would be black what else would be
45:35 black men why is that I'm gonna suggest
45:41 that in order to keep the set from
45:44 becoming this giant plume of dust
45:47 everywhere that perhaps they missed the
45:53 room maybe they didn't do this spray
45:55 down because you get a bunch of you know
45:57 disruptions to the to the beautiful job
46:00 they did at making this fake moon
46:02 surface but I'm gonna suggest that
46:05 that's been watered down a little bit
46:08 maybe it's a several maybe it's a
46:10 multi-stage process of watering it down
46:11 to water but they had to keep this stuff
46:13 stable and so when the boots were
46:17 breaking the soil right again rubber
46:20 boots on 280 degree sand it was
46:23 supposedly gonna work out for you you
46:25 know I live on the beach okay I'm you
46:28 know there's no the beach it's not like
46:30 right there but it's just three miles
46:31 that way okay there are certain shoes
46:34 that you can't spend all day in the Sun
46:38 wearing because they will melt they will
46:41 absolutely you couldn't wear
46:42 Birkenstocks trust me man you'd have to
46:45 you'd have to pick them up in your hand
46:47 burn your feet all the way to your towel
46:49 spot throw down your towel jump on your
46:52 town and roll those Birkenstocks
46:53 so they cannot possibly get exposed to
46:55 the Sun because the you know I don't
46:58 know the sweat shop that makes those
46:59 things the glue is just gonna absolutely
47:01 liquefy I had I had Birkenstocks I
47:03 bought one pair my entire lifetime when
47:05 I was in the Bay Area I almost joined
47:07 the the heart of the hippie side friend
47:10 of mine I had him tucked underneath my
47:12 driver's seat because I knew they were
47:15 fragile on the Sun this girl I was
47:18 taking the lives my buddy's girlfriend
47:19 she reaches dangerous oh my god he got
47:21 my keys back that's great and then she
47:22 put them down right in the Sun I came
47:24 back two days later $80 shoes or
47:26 whatever they were at the time 1990 two
47:28 or three just all melted and curled up
47:31 it's not space-age rubber that the thing
47:34 was made out of he's a rubber rubber
47:37 would you trust you know your slicks
47:40 what do they call it your rubbers that
47:42 you put on in the in the rainstorm so
47:46 you can walk around in the puddles would
47:47 you trust that with 280° underneath your
47:50 feet hell no so the limb landing on the
47:54 moon is the one thing that I think
47:56 scientists lack the empirical knowledge
47:59 of the moon of the vacuum when they may
48:01 have figured it out with some of the
48:03 satellites but I don't know they'd have
48:04 to get a satellite way outside the Van
48:06 Allen belts for a while it takes to
48:08 stabilize all the sensors and figure out
48:09 what's out there apparently they had
48:11 figured that out by 1988 with my
48:13 acquaintance from NASA who told me that
48:17 but you're gonna to factor all that in I
48:20 think we understand a hundred percent of
48:22 the moon's gravitational force 100
48:24 percent again the equations that
48:27 describe gravity are fairly accurate
48:30 okay if not immensely accurate what
48:33 gravity is they've got completely
48:34 backwards because they will not allow
48:35 ether to be a part of their model Mary
48:37 that won't affect their mission it trust
48:41 me but they also don't know how the soil
48:44 of the moon behaves because we haven't
48:46 put a nasa rover on the moon we haven't
48:51 done it and why isn't nasa done that why
48:55 is China done it twice supposedly
48:56 [ __ ] and why is this real tried and
48:59 crashed and India just launched a brand
49:02 new one today
49:05 because NASA can drive a rover all over
49:07 Mars for 15 to 17 to 20 years who the
49:11 hell knows right it's a hundred percent
49:13 successful I mean it exceeds every
49:15 operational parameter that they said it
49:17 would be able to do right they said
49:20 eleven months I believe is what they
49:22 said those Rovers were gonna do from the
49:24 early 2000s and 17 years later both are
49:27 just running around no problem why
49:30 because it's a cash cow
49:31 that's why why should we turn them off
49:34 the public seems to believe everything
49:38 we throw at them so why not just keep
49:39 lying to them and making however much
49:41 that operation is sucking out of the tax
49:43 dollars all right we can't put a rover
49:48 on the moon because the public would
49:50 expect the rover to drive to all of the
49:55 sites at least several of the sites in
49:57 17 years yeah man I mean how one mile an
50:01 hour how far do you think you go in 17
50:04 years you go quite a while right but
50:06 these things go a little bit faster in
50:07 one mile an hour
50:09 they can't jeopardize exposing the lie
50:12 that they that they have because you
50:14 would expect to land a rover in the Sea
50:17 of Tranquility and drive straight to the
50:19 limb and it's all got to be there the
50:22 kickstands got to be there all the steps
50:24 and foots in the American Flyer has got
50:25 to be there all the terrain has to match
50:28 all of the sets from the 60s that they
50:30 fabricated the the what is it two sets
50:35 of two missions have the same exact
50:38 terrain because they reuse the set I can
50:42 explain that man you're never gonna be
50:43 able to terraform the moon with a rover
50:46 before the shots taken so the whole
50:48 thing is gonna have to be faked so
50:49 what's the point they don't do it for
50:52 that one of those reasons is that reason
50:55 so some people might say well you know
50:57 what the government's job is to be a big
51:01 giant Santa Claus to create a fictional
51:04 image of what we could be sustained at
51:09 all costs such that we imitate art
51:15 we aspire to it I I if anyone believes
51:23 that that I I can understand why they
51:26 believe it like I said I mean ask anyone
51:29 in artificial intelligence programming
51:31 today who's over 35 if they also saw
51:36 2001 a Space Odyssey and absolutely got
51:40 sexually aroused by seeing the Hal 9000
51:42 behave like a human being in this big
51:45 black box with the red eyeball they'll
51:49 say yes absolutely when I saw that as a
51:52 kid I got fully inspired later editions
51:57 may have seen Tron and Sun saw the mCP
52:00 talking to Dillinger senior at his
52:02 office through that glass desk that
52:04 maybe that was their catalystic moment
52:07 we do imitate art and we do make real
52:10 things but for the government to defeat
52:14 Russia and the propaganda war using this
52:18 moon mission all right well here's
52:23 what's strange about it to me I'm always
52:27 asking you guys pretend like you've been
52:28 assigned to solve the problem and then
52:31 you'll find a lot of the reasons why
52:32 things happen in this world
52:33 the insanity starts to define itself and
52:36 clarify itself to us let's say that we
52:40 were forced to swallow a lie for six
52:43 missions with the failed seventh mission
52:45 also claiming the eight and ten went to
52:47 the moon and circled and came back
52:49 that's what we had to do to beat the
52:51 Russians and goddamn it we're not going
52:53 to have those commie bastards in our
52:55 country blah blah blah right so we had
52:59 to do that now those ended in 1972 so
53:06 what would be my operation in 1973
53:11 January 1st if the last thing that they
53:13 ever did was a moon claim in December
53:15 31st of 72 immediately I wouldn't wake
53:19 that damn long but I would immediately
53:21 seek funding for a black ops skunkworks
53:25 covert double decker
53:28 over Q clearance project to get our ass
53:31 to the moon immediately trying to figure
53:35 out how to terraform the land up there
53:37 to match these fake photographs we
53:39 created and that would be the toughest
53:41 thing would be almost the impossible
53:42 thing to do maybe the trick is honestly
53:46 to to go up there put the limbs
53:50 kickstands every place they said they
53:52 existed recreate all the tracks from
53:55 these these fake jeep buggy Rovers that
53:59 are up there and then you got to put
54:00 them up there for as well you got to
54:02 drive in all the American flags and you
54:04 got to figure out how they actually
54:05 behave in zero gravity with no
54:07 atmosphere as opposed to one that Neil
54:09 Armstrong pounding and we just going
54:11 back and forth like this for 60 seconds
54:13 which [ __ ] say we're just because you
54:15 kinetically bump the pole it's like oh
54:17 my god kill yourself but maybe what you
54:21 do is you you approach these sights from
54:26 different angles and you say well we
54:29 just had to shoot it north to south even
54:30 though all the photographs were taken
54:31 south to north was you know we just you
54:34 know we had limitations and this is what
54:35 we were able to do I mean while we're
54:38 building those mountains in the
54:39 background or something trying to smooth
54:40 them out but again we don't know how the
54:42 terrain of the moon works what if you
54:45 get to those locations because they're
54:47 supposedly GPS perfectly on the moon's
54:50 surface what if you get up there and
54:52 there's a giant boulder in the way what
54:55 are you gonna do
54:56 blast it get rid of it and then try to
54:59 put it all together again
55:00 geez that would be the worst part of the
55:02 whole mission of trying to fake this
55:04 thing but getting to the moon for real
55:06 would be your number one priority and if
55:09 it took you 30 40 years that'd be 10
55:13 years ago but we do we farted around
55:17 with the Space Shuttle then that blew up
55:19 several times because we went to the
55:21 moon six times and landed on it brought
55:25 them in back safely but we couldn't get
55:26 a space shuttle to launch every single
55:29 time and come back safe every single
55:31 time we lost two full crews of the space
55:35 shuttle and you might say uh
55:36 but we did a lot of more missions of the
55:38 space shuttle but I don't know by 1986
55:40 how many have we done
55:42 and it was that more advanced technology
55:44 or less fed technology the 1969 we know
55:49 it's way more technology again if going
55:56 to the moon can be likened to striking
55:58 Flint at the 55 degree angle they causes
56:02 fire to occur and that's what those mu
56:07 missions were when a man touches it and
56:10 comes back we've only seen fire created
56:13 by man six times in our lifetime and the
56:17 last time we saw it done was 1972 we
56:21 haven't seen fire since then it's always
56:23 serendipitous a lightning bolt hits a
56:26 tree and it catches fire and that's the
56:28 only way we could make it happen we
56:31 don't even have a magnifying glass
56:32 technique we haven't seen fire since
56:35 1972 as bart sibrel has said so many
56:39 times and so beautifully so it's the
56:44 only massive discovery and
56:46 accomplishment / accomplishment of
56:48 mankind that has never been repeated
56:50 since it was last done a lot of
56:53 americans are only told that we went one
56:55 time there's a bunch of mandela fact
56:58 people that only remember going one time
57:01 we went six we physically went there
57:05 seven eight nine times three of them
57:08 just orbited and came back I tell you
57:11 guys often especially those of you who
57:13 are not in America America is just a
57:18 dream an idea of living in a free world
57:24 under common law where we don't bother
57:26 each other we're not under a king a
57:28 queen or a president or a senator or a
57:31 house representative or a cop
57:33 they're just facilitators of common law
57:37 that's it as we gain economies and
57:42 agriculture there to help us figure out
57:45 how to make that better but not to
57:47 control us and we're still struggling to
57:50 realize that basic idea it has existed
57:53 in the past and it was usurped
57:55 by corrupt people lot of them from
57:59 Europe our ancestors our white ancestors
58:01 from Europe we get blamed for slavery
58:04 but none of the companies that brought
58:06 slaves over existed in America at any
58:08 point in time most of us are immigrants
58:12 after the slaves are already here but
58:14 you can get this whole thing promising
58:16 you know 40 acres and a mule 400 years
58:20 after the fact it's like why my
58:22 relatives were slaves to they're called
58:24 indentured servants they worked on a
58:25 plantation in Jamestown at 1630 had to
58:28 escape to get out of the joint so what
58:31 do I get
58:31 what do I get for that there's a bunch
58:35 of falsehoods that are running around as
58:36 truth and the moon mission is the most
58:40 recent 20th to 21st century lie it's
58:44 really a 21st century lie as of this
58:46 weekend as they recast this incredible
58:51 incredible lie as the truth in order to
58:54 what reinforce the nationalism identity
58:57 of America thus embedding inside the
59:00 bosom of America evil an untruth an
59:06 algorithm that doesn't pan out in the
59:08 end there's only like literally a couple
59:12 pretenses in modern first world
59:16 societies where we're allowed to lie to
59:20 a child and not suffer any repercussions
59:24 from our neighbors one of them is sadly
59:28 a bunch of you know winter solstice
59:32 offense religious events chocolate
59:34 bunnies Easter Bunny and I guess the
59:37 Easter Bunny the tooth fairy
59:39 all these different things we can lie
59:41 lie lie about that religion is the adult
59:45 version of that that's another one of
59:47 those sets of Lies but it has at least a
59:50 moral uptick I mean Santa Claus get your
59:52 kid to act good for about a week or two
59:53 in December in America so does it so boy
59:56 they're back to being little bastards
59:58 right if they're those kind of kids and
60:02 the other one is to spare your child a
60:05 huge shock of anxiety and trauma
60:08 someone dies doggy dies fish dies and we
60:14 we tell them those symbolic stories
60:16 about where these people are to soften
60:19 the blow but the truth of the matter is
60:21 perhaps they're completely safe and
60:23 another dimension of reality a pure soul
60:26 reality and it really isn't a big deal
60:28 but we can't prove it
60:29 so we don't lie we just sort of
60:32 embellish and those two forms of telling
60:36 lies are widely accepted but this kind
60:41 of lie a lie to enforce nationalism
60:46 well that's dangerous lie in it that's a
60:50 dangerous lie that's like telling a kid
60:53 let's just say a child loses a
60:56 grandparent very early or a parent very
60:58 early before they're even 10 very
61:01 shocking horribly traumatic you'll say
61:03 anything to keep your child from
61:05 imploding emotionally especially for the
61:08 rest of their lives yeah we
61:12 underestimate the brains of a child but
61:14 not all children are the same if you
61:17 bring the child up in a lucid world they
61:18 can usually deal with the lucidity of
61:19 death as disturbing as it might be
61:21 they'd eat a lot of hugs and kisses and
61:23 reinforcement that in spite of that loss
61:26 everything's gonna be okay because
61:29 you're there for them but they'll often
61:32 several times out of ten let's just say
61:34 I don't know I don't think it's the
61:35 majority but some kids will say some
61:38 kids will force the parent to say are
61:40 you gonna die are you gonna die me too
61:42 and the parent will just be shocked by
61:46 the question and then they will engage a
61:50 fib that is not healthy and they'll say
61:52 something like of course not and of
61:53 course I'll be here for you always and
61:55 of course they won't they can't death is
61:58 the undeniable destiny of all human life
62:01 in form of a human body soul goes on but
62:06 we do pass away but what would that sort
62:10 of lie do to a child because eventually
62:12 you do pass away and even and what if it
62:14 just unfortunately happened in a couple
62:17 of years now the child has been extra
62:21 traumatized because
62:22 that promise wasn't one that one could
62:25 keep in the first place the parent might
62:27 be hedging their bets and going well by
62:30 the time you grow up and figure out how
62:32 the life works you're gonna know that
62:33 that was something I told you to get you
62:35 through that moment in your life and as
62:37 a mature adult you'll deal with my death
62:38 as any child does but a little tiny kid
62:42 might freak out if it happens really
62:44 quickly okay if you tell someone that
62:49 their country has accomplished all of
62:52 these things that the country hasn't
62:53 accomplished and that you know maybe who
62:56 knows how that's being placed in the
62:58 soul of patriotism they might think
63:02 we'll we're better than all these other
63:03 countries were better than Russia let's
63:05 just say that was the way it was
63:06 interpreted in Americans heart but we
63:08 got there the Rooskies could get there
63:10 and later on as the slightest
63:14 perpetrated and propagated and repeated
63:17 over and over and over again they find
63:20 out the lie and now what do they think
63:22 oh my god maybe we are the scum of the
63:26 earth maybe we do need to join communism
63:28 as Russia gets out we get in right we're
63:32 gonna do some globalists rule or some
63:34 crazy thing like that simply because
63:37 they might revert to hating their
63:40 country because their country lying to
63:43 them and imagine you know if you listen
63:46 to this show on a regular basis then you
63:47 know that we track a tremendous amount
63:50 of very lucid provable lies forget all
63:56 the stuff we can't prove just think
63:59 about the ones we can prove no
64:02 corporations owned us from cradle to
64:04 grave at this point they fetus Lee all
64:06 these vaccinations were young give us a
64:08 bunch of crappy processed food we get
64:10 sick way before we're supposed to we
64:11 keep getting told that childbearing is
64:14 safer now which it's not we live longer
64:15 which we don't and you die early and
64:18 it's super painfully a bone cancer you
64:20 got a bunch of other brain tumors and
64:21 your family's whole savings is just
64:24 drained as all your you know health care
64:29 is dissolved remember Obamacare didn't
64:32 didn't cover everybody I can I had two
64:35 friends that went
64:36 the whole phase and were not allowed to
64:37 get Obamacare because they have
64:39 pre-existing conditions one with a
64:40 broken foot they would never heal and
64:43 one I'm was not told what the condition
64:45 was but the woman was not allowed to get
64:47 Obamacare because of a pre-existing
64:48 condition just one more lie on the pile
64:51 of lies well it's okay if you take that
64:54 president you say that president lied
64:55 100 percent million times on camera
64:58 about that particular policy but now you
65:00 have this one is supposed to be the big
65:01 hero he's got this other movement behind
65:03 him that's supposed to be the movement
65:07 the dew King against you know can't stop
65:10 incessantly whining about the fact he's
65:12 being attacked by the press out of all
65:14 the episodes that I've discussed this
65:16 sort of repair algorithm in I can't say
65:21 that I have the plan other than
65:25 everyone's got a nut up you know
65:27 everyone has to take a deep breath say
65:33 that that lie existed because of the war
65:36 that we were having with Russia and
65:38 Nicole factored financial version of it
65:41 in the philosophical output of either
65:43 democracy versus communism we had to do
65:46 it what if we didn't in this whole word
65:50 would go on maybe we'd have another
65:51 world war or something like that
65:52 probably not but well I could infer that
65:55 why was it repeated 50 years later Wow
65:58 you know I guess they could have just
66:00 let it brine we're in a stage now where
66:05 we are rebuilding our country
66:06 financially we're building and hopefully
66:08 in many other capacities hopefully
66:11 education is right around the corner
66:13 because that's the cornerstone of all
66:14 the ignorance that we have in this
66:16 country that allows all the privileged
66:18 in the world to act like absolute raving
66:20 children but here's what I don't
66:23 understand about this is another thing I
66:27 don't understand about going again and
66:30 doubling down on the 50-year lie
66:32 NASA is claimed again most of you don't
66:36 know because it's not being covered by
66:37 any the press because I don't think the
66:39 press wants to get caught up in this big
66:40 lie that in 2024 four and a half years
66:43 from right now another man is gonna be
66:46 stepping on the moon obviously a woman's
66:47 gonna be a part of it too
66:49 it's gonna be a lie 100% 100% light all
66:54 right
66:55 why did they just on their own say we're
66:59 gonna be there in four years where was
67:02 the president of United States to
67:03 announce it like JFK announced it JFK at
67:06 least gave us like nine and a half years
67:08 to get there why didn't the president
67:11 say well I'm gonna give us 10 years 15
67:16 years 20 years to get there it's not
67:17 gonna happen in my term Kennedy knew it
67:19 wasn't gonna happen his term either
67:20 because we have term limits would have
67:23 been close why didn't he come out and
67:25 say it is he baiting them is he trying
67:29 to expose them by agreeing to it are
67:33 they really gonna go down like that
67:34 but if you want to stimulate the economy
67:36 if you want to really bring the nation
67:39 together you don't say it covertly on a
67:42 webpage on nasa.gov and not covered by
67:46 any of the press I mean I saw maybe one
67:48 article covering it why not
67:51 exhibition the process outline all the
67:54 steps that we need to do 10-year 20-year
67:58 project doesn't matter I mean the longer
68:01 the better
68:01 right one we give ourselves the big head
68:04 start you got 20 years to pull this off
68:06 and we come up with a bunch of excuses
68:08 why the old technology wouldn't work
68:10 blah blah blah they can cover up all
68:12 their issues I don't think they can but
68:16 let's just say they somehow could pull
68:18 off a cover-up of absolutely every piece
68:21 of [ __ ] that happens to be the moon
68:24 line this this country would boom for
68:29 however many years we allowed that
68:30 project to continue kids would go back
68:33 into Sciences and it would be the
68:35 pretense to educate kids further into
68:38 science imagine going into a sixth grade
68:42 class and first year of middle school
68:44 and they tell all the little kids maybe
68:45 even fifth grade before they get out of
68:47 junior high and go into middle school
68:48 and they tell these kids hey we need a
68:54 bunch of scientists which one are you
68:57 gonna be which scientists are gonna be
69:00 you can study seals in space you can
69:03 radiation you could study aerospace
69:05 trajectories propulsion anything space
69:09 food right space icecream
69:11 whatever it is every cake could go into
69:14 a different discipline of science and
69:16 actually really use what they learn
69:21 because it is the name of the game we
69:23 have to have these solutions for 50
69:27 years late on this program and all we're
69:29 doing is recasting a lie to do it again
69:33 that is a fail
69:35 right there's fail compilations all over
69:37 the Internet and this is a gigantic
69:39 national fail for the United States of
69:42 America the more you love your country
69:46 if you live in the United States of
69:47 America the less you want to tolerate
69:49 this crap not the other way around
69:52 not the other way around now if someone
69:55 from NASA comes and knocks at my front
69:57 door says can I speak to you can we
70:00 speak to you as a bunch of them out
70:01 there with clipboards and lab coats on
70:03 and stuff and they come inside there's a
70:04 couple of Secret Service dudes or
70:06 whatever and he sit in my front room I
70:08 have to get all the chairs in there so
70:10 we're gonna have a seat they said look
70:12 here's the real deal yes we didn't go
70:15 and thanks for rubbing it in [ __ ] but
70:17 here's what we've been doing for 50
70:19 years covertly we have figured out all
70:21 the technology to get back there and we
70:23 have figured out how to cover all the
70:24 issues you talked about in your show
70:26 rebuilding the sets building everything
70:29 getting there safely and we got
70:30 everything covered everything covered
70:34 2024 here's your ticket to the launch we
70:40 got free room and board for you to sit
70:41 in Houston or wherever the hell this is
70:43 gonna be covered you can watch the whole
70:45 thing and we're gonna actually go you
70:48 can ask us any question you want right
70:49 now and here's all of our personal cards
70:52 if you want to continue asking us
70:53 questions yeah I breathe a huge sigh of
70:58 relief a huge sigh of relief but I just
71:02 told you is not happening it's a
71:04 fictional event it'd be really cool if
71:07 it happened but it's not gonna happen I
71:09 know what some of you might think and I
71:11 don't talk about this very often I want
71:14 you to know that I thought of this
71:15 several times we're gonna be on the same
71:16 lovelier
71:18 those of you that believe the potential
71:22 truth of bob lazar story of these UFOs
71:24 hidden in this secret mountain escape
71:27 just south of area 51 they they slide
71:32 these big plates out that are painted to
71:33 look like the side of the mountain and
71:35 you get to go in and then there's these
71:37 nine flying saucers that's what he said
71:41 initially he said the other ones are all
71:43 beat up and the one he worked on was
71:44 pristine and perfect then in his
71:47 documentary he didn't say anything about
71:48 the mall being injured whoops changed
71:50 the story hmm but could we use those
71:54 ships one of those ships maybe we can
71:56 duplicate this ship maybe they forgot
71:57 how to reverse engineer the antimatter
71:59 engine or whatever or through examining
72:01 them they figured out some other
72:02 propulsion technique could we then go to
72:06 the moon is the ship automatically
72:08 designed to go through Van Pelt so you
72:10 would assume so wouldn't you
72:12 so you fly that thing and you're
72:14 hovering right over the moon and of
72:17 course no one can see this event
72:18 happening of course so they go to those
72:21 those locations well here's a problem as
72:26 far as I know Bob Lazar has never talked
72:28 about a window out of the side of one of
72:30 those crafts so what do you do let's say
72:32 you could Park it do you get out what do
72:36 you do we're still human beings we still
72:38 have to defeat all these problems of
72:41 environmental conditions and issues so
72:44 physically getting there in some
72:45 spaceship yeah it'd definitely be an
72:48 achievement but unless man can get out
72:50 and walk around we're not there yet
72:53 and that's if we have a captured UFO man
72:56 isn't that interesting we're still not
72:59 done unless we can figure out something
73:02 but we don't have any evidence UFOs land
73:04 on the moon and walk around with a bunch
73:06 of you know dudes of course the
73:07 astronauts use that to smuggle in their
73:10 lie if they say they went there and they
73:12 saw a bunch of aliens you like oh well
73:14 sure we went to the moon because they
73:15 found a bunch of alien bases and that's
73:16 why we're not allowed to go back as they
73:18 came out and said no no no this is ours
73:20 just don't ask John layer and you'll be
73:23 fine they're not there there's nothing
73:25 there
73:26 it's just a moon those things aren't
73:28 craters they're boiling volcanic
73:30 eruptions from the
73:31 plasma interior now I'm gonna close this
73:34 out with just one brief little statement
73:37 brief paragraph I should say and one of
73:42 these things is well do we really need
73:43 to go to the moon I'm not sure I don't
73:46 know if there's in the impending doom to
73:49 the earth which that may not exist we
73:53 may not be having all these big you know
73:56 earth killing meteorites to come by
73:59 maybe those don't exist maybe those have
74:01 all been lies to hype up the whole idea
74:04 of this mission
74:05 I think strictly under the terms of a
74:09 Magellan sort of mentality that man is
74:12 seemingly had forever exploring is our
74:16 gig
74:17 it is and I think that the answer would
74:21 be well I wouldn't prioritize the moon
74:24 over education here on earth
74:26 I wouldn't prioritize the moon over any
74:29 of the gigantic political problems we're
74:30 having fiat currencies and all these
74:35 child touches that are getting arrested
74:38 yeah I think all those things should go
74:39 first all that money should be diverted
74:41 into those realms until all those people
74:43 are gone until weary engineer society
74:46 rebuild morality perhaps using religion
74:49 perhaps outside religion whatever the
74:50 case may be we need a way to motivate an
74:52 atheist to behave so that we don't have
74:55 all these kid touches but once that
74:58 stuff's taken care of and sure let's go
75:00 back to electives do we have so much
75:01 money and so many resources that we can
75:03 handle both at the exact same time I
75:05 think yes I think we do sadly it's not
75:10 occurring we're making progress but
75:12 there's a lot of a lot of cobwebs to get
75:15 out of the old cellar so anyway I think
75:20 you feel me on this one let's just say
75:23 the goal of this show this particular
75:25 episode is to get our narrative straight
75:28 we cannot inject or allow a lie to be
75:32 injected back into a movement of
75:35 awakening in this world under any
75:38 circumstances under any circumstances
75:42 I don't think we have supernatural
75:49 things happening necessarily we I it's
75:51 like it's all an impending doom and why
75:55 not just tell everybody life is good
75:57 the meteorite comes in destroys earth
76:00 and then we lived good into the last
76:02 second and maybe that one I would toss
76:04 up for a 50-50 yeah okay all right would
76:08 you like to know what your last day on
76:09 earth
76:10 mmm-hmm I don't know seems like you
76:12 would seems like you wouldn't I don't
76:14 think I want some of my neighbors to
76:15 know it's last day on earth I don't know
76:16 what they would do so maybe ignorance
76:19 would be bliss in that particular
76:20 scenario but we're not in that scenario
76:22 we're in real normal meat and potatoes
76:25 truth if we allow our brains to smuggle
76:31 in lies then it will never stop it will
76:34 never stop if you haven't been to deep
76:37 thoughts radio calm please go all the
76:39 links are up there I'll make it short
76:40 today all the video feeds are up there
76:42 all the audio feeds up there two ways to
76:44 donate to the show link to the all-new
76:47 remastered season one if you view
76:49 anything on the website it is the
76:52 version of the video I want you to see
76:54 again a lot of the episode ones were
76:56 banned in Europe so a lot of you who
76:59 have been watching from Europe you think
77:00 you've seen all the episodes if you
77:02 haven't combed through the season one
77:05 remastered channel it's a whole separate
77:06 channel that's different than this one
77:08 and there's probably a ton of shows you
77:10 haven't seen at least a dozen you have
77:12 never seen before so get out there and
77:16 get a look but until the next episode
77:20 take care of yourself and someone else
77:22 and I will see you in the next deep
77:23 thoughts over now
