00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentlemen it's looking Romeo and Juliet
00:34 Kuban the good friend of mine gifted to
00:37 me Pauly who sent me this amazing cigar
00:41 case he invented all by himself it was
00:44 truly a super shock I'll put some
00:47 photographs in here at the beginning
00:48 kicked this episode off I was totally
00:52 blown away it was awesome it's funny
00:54 because then he sends me pictures of his
00:55 world I swear to god he's in my backyard
00:57 - maybe a couple palm trees he
00:59 skateboards plays bass he's in a band he
01:03 could transplant here in two seconds so
01:07 today's episode is gonna be a little
01:09 weird for some of you probably most of
01:10 you but for some of you a handful of you
01:14 and you might even find this video as
01:16 the very first video you've ever seen of
01:18 deep thoughts just because of its name
01:20 and what's gonna be funny about it is
01:23 there's gonna be people who are gonna
01:24 watch this episode or see this episode
01:25 on YouTube and go what what the hell is
01:28 this about and there's some of you
01:30 they're gonna see this name ago oh my
01:32 god really and you're gonna click in and
01:34 you're gonna find out it's about what
01:35 you're experiencing and you're gonna go
01:37 this is crazy I thought I was the only
01:40 one I'm calling this episode the ghost
01:44 cat because as I understand it this is
01:47 what it's called online what is the
01:51 ghost Cadden for those of you who are
01:52 like what are you talking about
01:55 allow me such a good steak some of you
02:01 have experienced this event in your life
02:05 and it's not always necessarily a cat
02:09 type situation but there I will tell you
02:14 why I think that most of us in least one
02:18 scenario believe it's cat like you are
02:22 going to sleep or perhaps you are
02:26 rolling around in bed you you were
02:28 asleep and now you need to do that you
02:30 know left side right side switch this
02:33 event occurs when an individual is in
02:36 the twilight zone
02:38 between full consciousness and dream
02:41 state
02:42 it could be assisted by a little bit of
02:45 tipsiness
02:45 if you've been drinking just a little
02:47 bit I'm gonna share a whole different
02:49 experience with that but most the time
02:53 it's completely sober because I am a
02:55 person that barely ever drinks and I've
02:57 had this numerous times but one is lying
03:01 down in bed now if you're like most
03:03 people you lay down in bed and it's
03:05 usually when you're by yourself whatever
03:07 reason even if you sleep with someone
03:08 else they should step into a girlfriend
03:11 of mine I tuck her into bed and I still
03:13 had to do something else and it would
03:15 happen
03:15 or she will have gotten out of bed and I
03:19 was in there by myself or sometimes just
03:21 when you're by yourself sleeping this
03:23 occurs but you're laying down on one
03:27 side of the bed
03:27 and so you have the other half of the
03:30 bed that is unoccupied now how does
03:33 getting in bed work I mean you know in
03:35 terms of laying down you've got your
03:38 pillow that you're sleeping on maybe you
03:41 hug a pillow to your gut just to kind of
03:43 keep your leg and your spine all
03:45 together right highly recommend that but
03:50 what'll end up happening is up in the
03:52 usually their head region of the other
03:54 half of the bed is you have your eyes
03:57 closed
03:59 you will feel in the bed depressions in
04:04 the pillow next to you and the cloth
04:06 next to you and the mattress next to you
04:08 and sometimes if you're actually sort of
04:11 reaching your arms out as you're in your
04:13 side position you might be touching the
04:15 pillow with your hands you get this
04:18 inside the pillow other times it'll just
04:21 happen that it's the comforter that
04:23 you're on you will distinctly feel and
04:25 this is most important when you have no
04:28 pets like me I don't know any pets right
04:30 I'm allergic to cats like crazy but you
04:35 will feel little tiny pause in your
04:41 mind's eye it's the same sort of thing
04:44 as I've had cats before right and cats
04:45 will crawl up on the bed very carefully
04:48 you know after they jump on you give
04:50 that bump
04:51 they want to be careful right they want
04:53 to kind of get up next to you or they're
04:54 trying to find a place to sleep in the
04:56 same bed with you some in the morning
04:58 will come and lick your nose or whatever
05:00 this is prior to that licking part but
05:02 they'll come up and they'll start kind
05:04 of coming close to you and this happens
05:08 and what's really strange is you know if
05:12 someone came up to you you know you're
05:14 someone you're dating comes up to you
05:15 the next morning I had this weird thing
05:17 that happened to me it felt like a cat
05:18 was crawling on the pillow towards me or
05:21 on the mattress towards me you might if
05:23 you've never had the experience go
05:24 that's really weird but it happened in
05:27 my house it happened to both myself and
05:31 my girlfriend and sometimes just for
05:34 convenience sake we'd sleep in I had to
05:36 live three rooms I'd sleep another room
05:39 where I was working I just crash out and
05:42 I would have it in that room and she
05:44 would have it in her room and neither
05:47 one of us she she is a person who is
05:50 very you know doesn't know really what
05:56 she believes in not quite sure God
05:58 exists not quite sure heaven exists
05:59 doesn't have any ghost stories I mean
06:01 like the complete opposite of the ghost
06:05 story thing I mean she would consider to
06:08 be very embarrassing to ever tell a
06:11 story about that sort of thing and has
06:15 no history of it
06:16 so I've you know I've had her and
06:18 isolated and talked to her and and you
06:21 never anything happen like no no no she
06:22 was there when I did the Walt Disney
06:24 thing so that's an interesting one but
06:27 this had been going on you know probably
06:30 since my 20s I could definitely say I
06:32 can't remember if I had it before my 20s
06:34 I honestly can't remember but definitely
06:37 in my 20s this will happen every you
06:42 know a few years and it seems like when
06:43 it starts to occur it starts to occur
06:46 more often and you know I was looking
06:51 this up the other day and there are
06:53 stories about this they call it the
06:54 ghost cat it's funny so I wanted to
07:00 bring down one up and then bring up some
07:03 other things that have happened in my
07:04 and if those of you seen absolutely
07:06 every episode you will have heard about
07:08 some of these other things but I want to
07:12 mention all the case studies that have
07:14 happened to me personally or to my
07:15 girlfriend personally such that you know
07:19 I mean she's doesn't live here anymore
07:22 but when she did live and we were
07:24 together this is these are the things
07:26 that occurred so in fact what I was here
07:32 late one night by myself and I was gonna
07:37 have the whole night to myself and I was
07:39 up with some friends and I think I don't
07:42 know I you know again I don't have to
07:45 drink that much before I get a little
07:46 bit tipsy so I can be totally legal you
07:50 know to drive and I'm I'm I'm feeling
07:52 like I feel fine and then when I lay
07:53 down and you get that little bit of wish
07:56 eNOS right so I'm gonna admit that
07:58 because this is that's a rare addition
08:00 to me in my life but I get in bed in
08:04 it's summertime it's June
08:06 I think it's 2015 there's a warm summer
08:10 unlike this summer although it's not too
08:13 bad right now but I lie down and I do
08:17 that whole thing where you you you it's
08:21 too hot to put the sheets on right
08:22 completely on so you kinda you want some
08:24 sort of like I don't know mood feeling
08:26 so you put the sheets on you a little
08:28 bit but you kind of let your butt hang
08:29 out or you're backing out to kind of
08:31 radiate the heat and this is what had
08:33 happened I'd lie down and bow I was like
08:36 falling asleep really really quickly and
08:39 which is very rare for me because my
08:40 mind is always waking up the second I
08:42 put my head down but I lay down and I
08:50 felt because there's probably six inches
08:53 between my back and the edge of the bed
08:57 and someone right around my butt the
09:01 mattress literally goes down like
09:05 someone is sitting behind me on the
09:08 mattress and it was one of these
09:12 situations where you know you might I
09:16 don't know I don't know how one
09:17 hallucinate
09:19 a deformity in the mattress because
09:22 there's there's physics that end up
09:24 taking over like for instance if a
09:28 pillow has these depressions from the
09:31 cat paw like rhythm and movement right
09:35 it's a four-legged thing you you
09:37 actually sense the four things that if
09:39 you owned a cat which I have till I got
09:41 allergic to him you know what that's
09:44 like but this was so depressed on the
09:47 bed that I felt my body sliding
09:50 backwards and I wouldn't say it was a
09:54 man I would say it was like a a petite
09:56 woman kind of feeling and you know it's
10:01 funny because in a split second you
10:02 start to wonder you know I've definitely
10:06 had you know girlfriends that I had keys
10:08 to the house to someone trying to
10:09 surprise me and with a really bad idea
10:14 but I remember you know it also could it
10:19 also took on the notion and maybe it was
10:20 someone's knee on the mattress and so
10:24 you think well god is someone trying to
10:25 reach over my body right and so I
10:29 remember like just being just shaken you
10:32 know just oh my god
10:33 and you know sometimes you know people
10:40 report having sleep paralysis where you
10:42 can't move and I'm gonna get into that
10:44 because I don't ever have the sleep
10:47 paralysis with the cat
10:49 the ghost cat and I didn't have sleep
10:51 paralysis with this thing behind me
10:52 because I immediately he flipped over
10:55 and I was like oh my god you know and I
10:58 don't know if you can tell but I'm not a
10:59 real excited person I mean I'm not a guy
11:01 who's like all wound up and jittery I've
11:05 got people like that in my family that
11:07 are just just ready to pop every two
11:09 seconds here at him quite the opposite
11:11 so for me to be startled it takes quite
11:14 a bit but this got me you know I was
11:16 wrong no one was there of course and
11:19 that was the last big one I think I've
11:23 ever experienced but there was so when I
11:26 was living with my girlfriend who was
11:28 having this routinely happened to her
11:31 the interesting thing is it was like she
11:33 carried it with her except in this
11:36 particular case she had moved out of the
11:38 house like a month before and I was
11:41 there by myself and again it was the
11:42 last time I really had him but she would
11:46 have it and then I would have it and you
11:50 have to buy it yourself
11:51 this never happens when you're with
11:53 somebody else but now I I have had
11:55 several times in my lifetime and I mean
11:58 probably half a dozen very vivid ones
12:00 and I've talked about this a little bit
12:02 where I will wake up in a sleep
12:06 paralysis feeling and again there
12:09 supposed to be this chemical that
12:10 secretes in your body to make you have
12:12 paralysis otherwise if you were walking
12:14 in your dream you'd be walking in your
12:16 bed you know and so it's probably very
12:20 good that that actually occurs and you
12:21 know evolutionists try to extenuate that
12:25 we were monkeys and trees and the
12:27 monkeys monkeys have this happen so that
12:29 they don't wake up our fall out of a
12:32 tree if they're sleeping in a tree any
12:33 animal living in a tree needs to be very
12:35 careful how they sleep and how they wake
12:38 up right it's a decent theory but I
12:42 would wake up and there's two two
12:46 factors that happen I miss probably more
12:49 than that but the main one is I can't
12:51 open my eyes
12:51 and I get this sense of a being over me
12:56 pretty much like a adult male geared
13:02 body you know five ten six-foot
13:04 somewhere in there but I also get this
13:06 sense that it is very alien and I don't
13:10 say that to make the story sexy I don't
13:12 know why I feel that way but I have
13:14 never once felt like oh it's just a dude
13:16 in the room you know that has a whole
13:18 different connotation a guy in the room
13:21 because what would a human being you
13:22 know being the room is it some spy
13:24 looking at you me why would they do that
13:26 doesn't make any sense I just like to
13:28 watch you sleep I'm a creepy spy right
13:31 so you know I've had the dream I've had
13:38 the dream you know several times I put
13:40 this all but one it goes like this I
13:43 wake up no matter what
13:46 the creature is standing next to the bed
13:49 the edge of the bed so usually I guess
13:51 is when I'm facing away from the edge of
13:52 the bed that's very interesting I just
13:55 realized that right now and so they're
13:57 over me and I feel like I'm
13:59 misinterpreting the paralysis as them
14:02 holding me down that was the way it went
14:04 for at least three times I felt like
14:06 they were I felt like in my brain they
14:09 must be holding me down but I never felt
14:11 any hands on me that sort of thing when
14:13 later I realized it was just
14:15 unparalleled
14:16 and so in that case you know like I told
14:21 you with nightmares I used to have as a
14:22 kid I just won't put up with it and so
14:26 anything that's trying to constrain me
14:28 mess with me I flipped the other way and
14:32 I just say well I'd rather kill you than
14:34 deal with this [ __ ] you know and so
14:38 I would try to strong-arm my body you
14:41 know I'm trying to strong-arm myself a
14:43 week and I think in a couple cases it
14:47 was just me rolling over very very
14:49 slowly and then opening my eyes and
14:51 figure out nothing's there and it's
14:52 usually like broad daylight or early
14:54 morning I don't think I've ever had this
14:56 in a pitch-black night
14:59 Kathir stick it's gold
15:01 unbelievable it's kind of narrated as I
15:05 go along
15:07 well eventually I started realizing that
15:09 no one was holding me down and part of
15:13 it was I get this sense of fear at first
15:17 it's not a really acute oh my god I need
15:21 to you know run away it's more like
15:24 who's doing this I just want to know
15:26 who's doing it and to get it to stop the
15:32 last time I had that particular thing
15:34 happened to me it was probably about
15:35 10:00 11:00 in the morning I hadn't
15:37 working all night and I went to bed and
15:39 I woke up and this was on me and that
15:43 particular night I had I had moved a
15:50 firearm into the room with me so it was
15:54 always available because I wasn't not in
15:56 my normal room I have
15:58 options of similar caliber and so in my
16:03 mind I am thinking okay now I'm being
16:07 held down and I'm gonna blow this
16:10 [ __ ] away this is what I'm
16:11 thinking and so in my dream thank God it
16:14 was just a dream right this did change
16:16 me a little bit when I woke up in my
16:18 dream I have armed myself and I am
16:24 turning over and it's like I'm in it's
16:26 not even just water I am in utter
16:28 slow-motion and I am trying to just get
16:31 this barrel pointed and trying to figure
16:33 out what I'm gonna be lining up with of
16:35 course I would never just randomly pull
16:37 a trigger but I'm I'm looking over and I
16:39 finally wake up and I realize I haven't
16:43 moved at all I have no weapon in my hand
16:45 whatsoever and in all honesty it wasn't
16:49 really in my hand because that has a
16:50 whole separate feeling waiting it's cold
16:53 and you know it's a very serious
16:55 engagement you know I'm not a guy who
16:57 ever thinks about my weapon when I'm
16:58 having a dispute with somebody or
17:01 anything like that it's strictly for the
17:03 one-in-a-million situation right like
17:05 you got an earthquake and there's
17:07 looting going everywhere and you're
17:09 trying to protect your stuff you might
17:11 sidearm up during that until the police
17:13 can get to your area military gets to
17:15 secure the whole situation so I wake up
17:19 and I realize two things one I don't
17:22 have a gun two if finally dawned on me
17:27 in the middle of situation and I don't
17:29 know why I'm gonna I'm gonna throw a
17:30 little romantic suggestion to you in the
17:33 middle of situation suddenly as this
17:36 keeps occurring to me suddenly it occurs
17:40 to me that this is not an enemy at all
17:46 whatever this thing is it's just there
17:51 it's just there and it's looking at me
17:53 which is interesting because if you
17:57 think about yourself making it up in
17:59 your mind which is a really strange
18:03 thing which is what I want to get into
18:04 in this episode even deeper if you're
18:07 just making it up why would you make it
18:09 necessarily a threat
18:10 the only thing I think of is this is
18:13 something that you would that would only
18:14 occur in real life by someone who's
18:17 probably not wishing you the best of
18:20 luck you know if you're a little kid and
18:22 you got a fever or you're sick and
18:24 you're an adult and people might come in
18:27 and check up on you but people usually
18:29 don't just walk in and look at you you
18:32 know well if you're sick they'll tuck
18:35 you in a little bit more they may check
18:37 your forehead change your compress
18:38 whatever ask you questions either sleep
18:41 whatever right it's not going to be some
18:43 creeper staying on the edge of your bed
18:46 so at that point and this is what's sad
18:49 is that I now have looked forward to
18:52 that moment happening again because the
18:55 idea is don't be aggressive don't be
18:58 afraid and if you can get those two
19:00 emotions not to occur if you can be a
19:02 logical thinking scientific person then
19:06 maybe I get to the next level with this
19:08 being and actually communicate identify
19:10 I know it seems strange take such a
19:13 thing and and actually commit it to
19:16 reality but I want to ask you what would
19:20 be the logic the scientific logic of
19:23 thousands of human beings around the
19:25 world having a ghost cat experience what
19:28 sense does that make
19:29 I'm not even a cat person anymore I mean
19:32 I like I don't dislike cats or anything
19:33 I got one in my neighborhood that
19:35 belongs to everybody and I think he's
19:37 great when he comes around but you know
19:41 I'm not sitting at home wishing I had a
19:43 cat I'm not someone who goes oh gosh you
19:45 know what if I was when I was a kid I
19:46 had nothing at all strange so let's go
19:53 back to the time her and I were living
19:56 together and this is mrs. start this is
19:59 around the time I had my thing with the
20:01 alien the only time I was totally living
20:04 by myself was the one the last one I
20:05 really had with the knee feeling or
20:07 something behind my backside okay but
20:12 we're living together and this is
20:13 starting to occur fairly frequently I
20:16 mean we're talking once a month for each
20:18 one of us either the cat or this other
20:20 hovering thing
20:23 and I am working in my spare bedroom
20:27 I got headset on and I know a lot of you
20:32 work with headsets a lot that's the way
20:34 you roll I used to do that a lot in the
20:36 90s they haven't really worked like that
20:38 in a long time so this was sort of like
20:40 new for me to put these headsets on and
20:43 my girlfriend at the time was really
20:44 sensitive to music any sounds at night
20:46 so if I put those up too loud in a
20:49 totally separate room she would come in
20:50 and go get you turn those down so I'm
20:53 chilling out I don't have him up too
20:55 loud I'm looking at my computer and I'm
20:58 hearing something strange and I you know
21:03 sona's moment you well that was weird
21:05 that wasn't part of my music my and my
21:07 volumes turned up turn is my volume
21:09 turned up on my computer so I pull them
21:11 off real quick a free up an ear for the
21:15 very first time in my life I hear a
21:18 woman scream in my house and it was sort
21:22 of not not like a you know terror scream
21:25 like you might see in a movie but some
21:26 sort of like bizarre you know yell and
21:31 now I'm going I'm just going into like
21:34 Guardian mode and so I like pop up and I
21:37 go in the bedroom and she's like all on
21:42 pulling herself out of the bed kind of
21:45 like ragi odd you know and I said what's
21:49 going on what's going on she's like oh
21:50 my god oh my god you know she's so not
21:52 this kind of person I mean at all right
21:56 and she goes so there was someone at the
21:58 edge of the bed at the end of the bed
22:01 and she said it looked like someone is
22:03 silhouette and I said what it looked
22:09 like she goes well she goes it was
22:12 either Thor or it was you because you
22:15 have the same whole building I was
22:17 working out like crazy at the time which
22:18 is kind of funny but she goes it was
22:21 this long you know short long hair just
22:23 like my hair is right now and it just
22:26 freaked her out huge and so you know
22:31 this is the guiness repeat one episode
22:34 way way back probably in season 3
22:37 but I made so that's this this story
22:40 gets embedded in my mind so a couple
22:42 years later 2016 at least a year and a
22:44 half later I had met someone online and
22:49 we had become friends and she was in
22:52 Ireland she is in Ireland and she was
22:56 telling me that a bunch of stuff about
23:00 this sort of thing but she hers was more
23:04 intense and you know I can't really
23:05 vouch for whether or not this person is
23:07 likely to tell this kind of story but
23:10 this one's pretty fascinating and I
23:12 didn't get the census persons trying to
23:13 press me in any way shape or form or you
23:16 know just wasn't a big tall tale kind of
23:19 personality you can tell it's kind of
23:21 personalities cuz they're always like
23:22 and then and then and they always have a
23:24 story and there's always a million of
23:26 these things and then they go off and
23:27 other you know tangents and other rabbit
23:30 holes that are very similar to the
23:31 paranormal nothing wrong with that but
23:33 this person wasn't that kind of person
23:35 at all very stable minded individual
23:37 very intelligent but she said that when
23:40 she was younger and I don't know what
23:43 age but considerably younger than what
23:46 she was make she's about 30 or so she
23:50 told me that her and her mother were
23:51 sitting on the bed and her father had
23:54 passed already and she said that like
23:59 she's looking at her phone and her mom's
24:00 looking an iPad or something like that
24:02 they're busy but they're together and
24:04 lights on the room and that they both
24:07 looked up at the end of the bed in the
24:11 broad daylight they're not brought daily
24:13 but night night night staying kind of
24:15 late and said that there was a guy
24:20 standing there and they both shrieked
24:23 and they both froze because they're like
24:26 where the hell this guy come from what's
24:28 he gonna do and they were both seeing
24:31 the same individual and then in some
24:36 change of events some movement in their
24:39 bodies the guy disappears then they
24:42 immediately chimeric compare notes what
24:44 did you see what the guy looked like
24:46 brown hair blue eyes whatever the guy
24:48 looked like I don't know what he looked
24:49 like I can't remember what she said
24:50 but she goes I swear to you my mom and I
24:54 both saw this dude at the end of the bed
24:56 now the end of the bed thing is all over
25:01 the web as well people have this
25:03 experience but the interesting thing
25:06 about this girl is that she works at
25:09 hospice place or at least did at the
25:11 time I knew her and she mentioned that
25:15 all kinds of interesting things happen
25:17 at a hospice and for me just being a
25:20 script writer it was just was awesome
25:23 you know fodder for the mind and events
25:25 and just cool things that she said that
25:28 it she goes what I'm about to tell you
25:30 is me I'm paraphrasing what she said but
25:33 she says what I'm about to tell you is
25:34 gonna sound really nuts and it's gonna
25:37 sound like I'm one of those people but
25:39 you have you know I could tell she
25:40 wasn't one of those kind of folks but
25:41 she said look this stuff happens so
25:43 often in my job that it's no big deal to
25:48 us anymore but it's always a huge deal
25:50 and it's very shocking when I when you
25:52 first start at the hospital and so I'm
25:55 like okay I'm listening so she had a few
25:58 things she said one there's a weird
26:01 thing when someone passes away in a room
26:03 because they're always you know about a
26:06 50-50 chance that anyone's in there is
26:08 gonna pass away they're all in Hospice
26:10 so they're all in the edge of their life
26:12 anyway that this would happen when
26:13 someone's in the room and sometimes we
26:16 know someone is some you know having
26:18 heavy breathing and this is it and so
26:20 they'll hold their hands and talk to
26:22 them and stuff I mean these people are
26:23 amazing people I mean I hope there's a
26:26 special place and you have your life for
26:27 these people quite frankly I think it's
26:30 quite it's quite possible that they're
26:33 amazing Souls get this extra view simply
26:37 because they are amazing Souls I could
26:41 pull it completely can believe that but
26:43 she says when someone passes away in a
26:46 room the room starts to smell of like a
26:49 very clean plastic she she likened it to
26:52 some of the garbage bags that they use
26:54 you know and you whip out a garbage bag
26:56 and you start putting air in it so you
26:58 can get inside your trash can she said
27:00 it's kind of like the smell of some of
27:03 the trash bags we
27:03 it's very pleasant and she goes you know
27:07 it's not part of their bodily function
27:10 or anything like that it's just this
27:11 weird thing that occurs second thing she
27:15 says that it's happened to virtually
27:17 everyone who's worked there five to ten
27:19 years somewhere in that range she said
27:21 that on more than one occasion a person
27:25 will pass away and the hospice worker is
27:31 obviously still alive will notice that
27:34 the room fills up with I guess you could
27:37 say spirits and it seems like it's their
27:41 family coming to usher them to the next
27:44 realm of life but it does take on a
27:48 humanoid sort of impression in the world
27:52 which is very interesting that Mormons
27:53 will be very happy I think most people
27:56 believe you get to the other side and
27:58 you have a body because we can't think
27:59 of being outside of our body but the
28:01 Mormons had really throw down on that
28:02 whole concept which is fine
28:05 but the third thing she mentioned I
28:07 think is a little well it's very
28:10 interesting and it correlates with a lot
28:11 of the ghost stories we've heard over
28:12 the years which is that she said that
28:15 this next thing I'm gonna tell you it
28:18 happens usually only to the rookies the
28:21 people that come in fresh it goes the
28:25 sprinklers but she said that a lot of us
28:29 you know we have to go on breaks here
28:31 and there throughout the day and usually
28:34 you know if you take care of all the
28:35 chores and there's always just a natural
28:37 break period but during breaks the you
28:42 know the longtime workers will be in the
28:43 break room and some you know rookie will
28:47 be out there handling folks and she said
28:51 that as the as the core example was a
28:54 real situation where this girl came in
28:56 the room and said someone asked her
29:00 where she was and she said I was just
29:03 helping this is so-and-so down the
29:06 hallway into her room and they're like
29:10 they look at each other leg up it
29:12 happened again and yeah and what had
29:14 taken place was they said well who who
29:15 was it again
29:17 she names a name now what's interesting
29:19 is is the person who had escorted this
29:23 woman to her room a patient was so new
29:28 that she didn't know that that woman had
29:32 died at least a week before the event
29:36 occurred and so the person I guess
29:41 showed back up and repeated a little
29:46 little event and I know that sounds
29:49 crazy I know that sounds nuts but think
29:51 about the fact that when you see a movie
29:57 it outside of like a Marvel film where
30:00 everything is just time-travel and crazy
30:02 things that could never happen in the
30:04 real world you know guy picking up a
30:06 building but anything that has any soul
30:08 to it in a story any book you've ever
30:11 read it's usually based on a bunch of
30:15 micro events and from people's lives
30:17 that are all been stitched together and
30:19 of course week since you eight and and
30:22 and you know turn it up to eleven even
30:25 though it may have only been three for
30:27 the person who experienced it but how
30:31 many ghost stories do you have or that
30:34 you've heard where a person who was past
30:37 you know the hitch-hiker story the guy's
30:39 the hitchhiker it's in the truck and
30:43 sometimes it's just point A to point B
30:46 and then the trucker goes in and says I
30:48 picked up this really great guy he was
30:49 really great and they then they
30:52 eventually say the name and everybody
30:53 the diner looks at each other and they
30:55 go yeah well he died you know five years
30:58 ago on that Highway right there where
30:59 you picked him up then there's the story
31:02 where the person there's a little added
31:04 extra thing to where the person says be
31:07 careful right there and because the
31:10 person said be careful the person
31:12 driving did something different and they
31:15 realized if they hadn't done something
31:16 different they were gonna die there's
31:17 something happened there's black ice or
31:19 ridges out or whatever and so there's a
31:23 life-saving experience that the it's
31:26 like a guardian angel the person passed
31:28 from the bridge falling out or because
31:30 of black
31:31 I said because of something and they
31:32 want to protect everyone from the same
31:34 demise that they had so they're gonna
31:36 sit and try to do what they can for
31:39 those that can see them maybe there's
31:41 some requirement for for human beings to
31:44 see them maybe an open mind who knows
31:46 right now you know from all the dream
31:49 episodes I've done we definitely talked
31:52 about this this thing that can happen
31:55 and again I haven't drawn out any
31:58 comments from anyone to agree with this
32:01 experience but there was there's a least
32:05 a couple comments back on one of the
32:06 dream episodes of someone who actually
32:07 had this experience but the experience
32:10 is that when you go to sleep and you're
32:12 in the twilight zone face meaning
32:14 between consciousness and full sleep
32:16 stage there's it's an amazing place to
32:18 be and everyone does it every single
32:20 night now those of you who follow sleep
32:22 extremely fast it's almost like you're
32:24 falling through this layer so quick you
32:26 don't recognize it but for those of us
32:28 who take a little while longer to get to
32:30 bed you're in the sort of Fantasyland
32:32 you know you can see things you can just
32:35 imagine things and see things and again
32:37 it's phenomenal how your brain can
32:38 render anything in full 3d 4k all the
32:42 shadows in our place light sources in
32:44 the right place you can imagine a
32:45 spaceship that you've never seen before
32:47 in two seconds and it's correct it's a
32:49 really strange thing it's a powerful
32:51 thing that we have its creationism
32:53 you're just in that mezzanine where it
32:57 probably is literally the conduit
32:59 between where our souls live and where
33:01 we live inside of our bodies you know
33:03 but you can imagine a whole history in a
33:06 split second that has never occurred but
33:09 you will feel as if and that's what
33:11 second that not only is that a history
33:13 real meaning it's in the past but you'll
33:17 feel like you're a part of it and a lot
33:19 of times you'll psych yourself out I
33:20 haven't had that had this happened in a
33:22 while but I used to have this thing when
33:24 I was younger that I would not only
33:26 dream out of a history real quick but it
33:27 would be I have forgotten something like
33:30 I told someone I would do something and
33:32 I didn't do it and then that
33:33 accountability bubble hits me and I'm
33:35 like oh my god
33:36 and then I find out all that's fake I've
33:39 never been with that person I don't have
33:41 any commitments and then you're like oh
33:43 this relief
33:44 so the the common denominator of the
33:49 ghost cat and all these sorts of
33:51 impressions and I'm gonna get to a whole
33:52 another ghost thing that I've shared
33:55 only one time before after this but it's
33:58 always in for me and I've interviewed
34:01 you know my girlfriend several times on
34:04 this like when she had this experience
34:07 when she used to live here
34:09 you were you in you're in the twilight
34:11 zone face and answers always yes and so
34:16 when you're waking up you're coming back
34:18 up through the apparatus so when I would
34:20 have the person on top of me you know
34:22 we're looking at me or something
34:24 and I you know sometimes I get the sense
34:26 they were actually reaching out and sort
34:28 of touching me a little bit but it
34:30 wasn't that I felt them touching me
34:32 exactly it just was that they were
34:33 recently touching me when I woke up but
34:37 it is in that face so the question is is
34:42 if this were to have an EVA Lydda T of
34:44 reality that you could have this is a
34:49 Star Trek episode as would be perfect
34:50 right they've had several dream episodes
34:52 where people are hiding in this other
34:54 dimension messing with all the people on
34:56 the enterprise or on the whether it was
35:00 at the Voyager Enterprise
35:01 I recently rewatched the next generation
35:07 episode that had this because there's
35:09 two one of them is a next-generation
35:12 episode where you know the wharfs arm
35:15 had been cut off and reattached and
35:19 about three or four people on the on the
35:22 enterprise that had these weird moments
35:25 and they couldn't sleep very well but
35:27 they heard this clicking noise and this
35:29 clattering noise so the only ones a
35:30 holodeck and started piecing together
35:32 that they they remember at a table that
35:35 was there and they started designing the
35:37 table together Geordi was there nothing
35:39 Troy was there and Riker was there and
35:41 Worf was there and they eventually
35:42 talked about an arm with a little like a
35:44 razor on it and all this other stuff and
35:46 they found that they were being observed
35:48 by a alien culture that was hiding in
35:50 another hiding with stealth equipment on
35:53 but I believe it's Voyager that has the
35:56 one where they were actually walking
35:57 around
35:58 whirring mechanical apparatus that were
36:02 actually embedded into their skull but
36:04 they couldn't see it but everyone was
36:06 having headaches so you know I got this
36:07 worst headache ever and that was a very
36:10 similar copycat episode which was great
36:12 okay so this ghost cat thing is
36:17 happening to my girlfriend and I for a
36:19 long time and it's only with her that's
36:21 the other word thing no one's ever said
36:22 they had this that I've ever known
36:24 personally so if you've had this I would
36:28 love to hear your stories honestly but
36:31 the other one was that we through an
36:35 acquaintance she had met a woman that
36:38 had gone to Paris to live from for
36:41 business she's from America she goes to
36:43 Paris to live and she had rented this
36:46 beautiful apartment and if you've ever
36:48 seen some of the apartments in Paris
36:51 it's unbelievable what'll cost like
36:54 $1,000 a month that's like a 15 by 15
36:57 room I mean it is hideous some of this
37:00 crap I mean they look okay but I mean
37:02 jeez if you're an art student I get it
37:04 but if you're professional or you
37:06 actually live there it's just insanity
37:08 this was a normal multi bedroom flat but
37:15 the woman goes over that she's a
37:16 professional I can't remember exactly
37:18 what she did but we're talking CEO level
37:21 high IQ woman who is very by-the-book
37:24 very Martha Stewart and personality as I
37:26 have described to me so not a person
37:28 who's into paranormal not a person that
37:30 would waste their life really having
37:33 anything to do with recreation in
37:35 general let alone telling tall tales to
37:37 then lose the status of discerning
37:40 brilliant CEO right because you could
37:42 you could be cast as a nut and lose your
37:46 job if you told these kind of stories
37:47 but this woman I told my girlfriend the
37:50 story but she tells the story of
37:55 unpacking her stuff she just got there
37:58 she's got her luggage she doesn't have
38:00 her stuff shipped in from the United
38:02 States just yet but she has several
38:04 suitcases that she brought and so she's
38:06 kind of unloading the first you know a
38:08 couple weeks worth of suits and that
38:10 kind of thing right
38:12 and by the way I've had a request to
38:15 film the possum but that is very
38:16 difficult because this is on a tripod
38:18 and it's pointing down so it I won't
38:21 disturb the show for that but at some
38:22 point I will get that shot for you guys
38:24 she's over there walking her now but she
38:28 said that she was unpacking her stuff
38:30 putting her stuff away it's broad
38:31 daylight and she turns around and on the
38:35 mattress is the imprint of what appeared
38:39 to be a female but on this mattress and
38:44 she is literally terrified she's not
38:49 screaming anything but she's terrified
38:51 of what the hell's going on like looking
38:53 at it it's not going away
38:55 and it's there I believe the story is
39:00 that she immediately left the apartment
39:02 and went got some food or something
39:05 I think it was early evening or
39:07 something like that but it's still
39:08 bright out so she continues to try to
39:13 live there she's got to live there
39:15 because she set this whole thing up but
39:17 she said there were but the mattress
39:21 thing was huge and she eventually gets
39:26 so freaked out and so tired of dealing
39:28 with this randomness that she sells the
39:32 place or gets out of it I think she
39:34 bought the place because the second half
39:37 of the story was that she was at some
39:39 other event about a year later and ended
39:45 up talking to some guy and come to find
39:49 out the dude actually bought her place
39:52 after she bought it she didn't know
39:54 about it she just bought it you know
39:55 there's some guy body she put on the
39:57 market or whatever and she said you live
39:59 in that place I used to live there why
40:02 don't you live there anymore cuz he was
40:04 talking about how he got out of this
40:05 crazy place and he goes I quote quote
40:09 because it's [ __ ] haunted and she was
40:12 like right he didn't elaborate on
40:16 anything as I understand it but he was
40:19 like in fact the way the story was told
40:21 is that
40:22 after admitting that he walked away from
40:25 her
40:25 and was like I'm not even talking about
40:27 this like he was way more freaked out
40:29 which is hilarious ladies right she was
40:31 more capable of dealing with it than him
40:35 so you hear these stories from people
40:37 that are credible people who have
40:41 everything to lose by mentioning sorts
40:43 of things these sorts of things right
40:45 and the thing is is I'm not I'm not
40:50 going to go into the stories again but
40:51 go see my episode on was it ghosts and
40:56 demons I think that's way back in season
40:57 one this is a new channel just go to
41:00 deep thoughts radio comm and you'll find
41:02 it there so normally you know if I
41:05 didn't have this experiences myself and
41:08 then especially sharing it with another
41:09 human being in the same house you know I
41:12 mean like first you think about what
41:14 maybe a cat died and the cat still
41:16 chillin out at your house it's like I
41:18 don't I don't know it almost freaks me
41:21 out a little bit I mean not really
41:23 freaked me out but it's kind of like
41:24 what would be the lodge you can hang and
41:25 hang it out on earth especially hanging
41:28 out in the same house you know there's
41:30 the Beetlejuice movie where you know the
41:34 family doesn't want to leave the house
41:36 because they died young in the house and
41:38 so like I didn't get our dreams but they
41:40 don't want else to live in the house and
41:41 so they're summoning beetlejuice to
41:43 scare the people out of the house and so
41:46 they end up at the end of the movie
41:48 reconciling with the family that bought
41:50 the place and they have the place to
41:53 themselves so there's that whole thing
41:57 but when you because I want my whole
42:00 life I say this put this way I was in my
42:02 mid-30s I would say before I had the
42:05 experience of my grandmother having
42:08 passed either that morning or the
42:10 previous night I wake up it's about 12
42:13 o'clock summer 11 12 o'clock or
42:17 something like that it's broad daylight
42:18 my girlfriend's already gotten out of
42:20 the bed she's in the kitchen messing
42:21 around and my grandmother's hovering
42:24 over my bed in like a white gown it's
42:26 kind of flowing like a Spielberg water
42:28 of fact thing and she just said you know
42:32 she said I just want you to know I'm I'm
42:34 on the other side and I'm okay and I
42:38 just talked to someone the other day
42:39 that had
42:40 someone who passed in their life telling
42:43 them that their relative came to them
42:45 after death and said something something
42:48 something and I'm okay
42:49 he's intent interesting I was like well
42:51 you haven't even heard my others heard
42:52 my side of the story you know my version
42:54 of that so I got two stories in the last
42:57 two weeks where mine and hers matched up
42:59 and then there's the first deep thoughts
43:03 listeners so if you're brand new you're
43:05 gonna have to go watch out of their
43:06 episode because I cannot torture the
43:09 listeners one more time with this story
43:10 but there was an event I swear on
43:14 anyone's grave that I find sacred and it
43:18 was witnessed by four different people
43:19 me being one of them I guess three other
43:21 people or I went to Disneyland Walt
43:25 Disney walks up to me tells me where to
43:27 find one of the oldest well the oldest
43:29 surviving imaginary which I had met two
43:31 weeks earlier I walk straight to the guy
43:34 and a weird part in the park he was
43:37 there I shook his hand we docked and
43:39 it's a very real situation and then I
43:42 talked a bunch of my other friends at
43:43 work at Disney for like years for like
43:45 seven years they're like oh yeah the
43:47 dude still lives there man he's all over
43:48 the place he protects people and they
43:52 said you know one I may not have told
43:54 quite as clearly one of the biggest
43:57 problems for people that work there for
43:59 a long period of time as as Security's
44:00 always chasing reports of kids playing
44:05 and having fun especially on Tom Sawyer
44:08 Sawyer's Island where it's you have to
44:10 get to it first and then you have to
44:12 look around because they can't have kids
44:13 messing around you know what they're not
44:16 supposed to be and there's a big there's
44:18 a big show that goes on with fire and a
44:21 bunch of other stuff about 9 o'clock
44:24 it's 8:30 or 9:00 and so they can't have
44:28 kids running around they gotta clear the
44:29 place out but they have heat-sensing
44:31 cameras now they've got movement cameras
44:33 and none of these devices are firing off
44:36 but these security people have to follow
44:38 up just in case something happens or
44:40 ever they say they never find these kids
44:42 one of the guys I talked to there's one
44:46 of the most mild-mannered guys I've ever
44:48 met my life he doesn't strike me as the
44:52 guy to have the imagination
44:54 she to make up the story that he said no
44:57 no slide on him he's just not that kind
44:59 of guy
45:00 but he told me that he was working on
45:01 the steamboat and he goes he's with
45:05 several of security people there spread
45:06 out all over the place and the two of
45:08 them were on the boat and they said they
45:11 heard a voice that sounds just like the
45:14 recordings of Walt say you boys better
45:17 get back cuz the boy is gonna blow and
45:20 they're both like you know they're it's
45:23 it's a weird in your ear kind of thing
45:25 like someone's like right there but
45:26 they're on a boat so where the hell is
45:28 that gonna take place right some guy
45:29 swims up and says it and then gets back
45:31 into water but that my buddy said he
45:35 goes I look to my friend and I said did
45:36 you hear that and he says the only thing
45:38 my friend said back was says we better
45:41 get back and they both walked away and
45:43 then boom the boiler blows up on the
45:46 steamboat and took six months to fix so
45:49 I don't know if this ghost cat thing has
45:53 anything to do with true ghosts or if
45:55 it's some other anomaly but it's a weird
45:58 thing that there's a commonality among
46:00 people and a hell if it weren't for the
46:03 Internet we would never find each other
46:04 right and the other strange thing about
46:07 the ghost cat thing just to keep going a
46:09 little bit here is that it comes up by
46:13 your head and I you know the more I
46:16 think about it you know it's funny when
46:17 you think about something that you
46:19 usually just gloss over you know neither
46:22 guy yeah the ghost the cat thing happens
46:23 and you go on thinking about your day as
46:25 I'm sitting here lamenting pontificating
46:30 about this it does strike me that there
46:33 probably is at least one or two
46:35 circumstances where it may have happened
46:37 lower in the bed but I'm telling you 80%
46:41 of the time at least it's up by your
46:43 head and it's just a really strange
46:45 thing that it would be by your head now
46:49 and the other thing is that the thing
46:51 that happened behind me it was so not by
46:52 my head right the people at the end of
46:55 the bed that's not by your head so if
46:59 it's some proximity issue due to neural
47:03 toxins that are
47:04 someone around in your head maybe you
47:06 drink or or you're so tired that your
47:09 brain is starting to kind of cross wires
47:11 and you know you're going to sleep world
47:13 right you're disengaging from your
47:15 mortal coil a potentially crossing over
47:18 into dreamland it's extremely
47:21 interesting that that seems to be a
47:22 commonality well the way I'm supposed to
47:25 say I'm supposed to say this I hate
47:28 starting an episode like this because
47:30 it's the most annoying thing to hear at
47:31 the beginning of an episode if you think
47:35 you're subscribed to this channel make
47:36 sure you're still subscribed because you
47:39 might get it off Facebook or Twitter or
47:41 the website you don't even realize
47:42 you're not subscribed anymore and if you
47:44 do notifications I don't typically click
47:47 the bell just to be honest if you dig
47:49 notifications the second something that
47:51 happens make sure that bells clicked I'm
47:53 getting a significant amount of reports
47:55 for the last year and a half since
47:57 shadow banging started that people are
48:00 being unsubscribed by the dozens and the
48:05 bells obviously being unchecked very
48:07 easily and just before we go back to the
48:10 episode I have absolutely positively
48:14 tracked the fact that YouTube is
48:17 stealing view counts in case in point is
48:21 my most popular episode as far as
48:24 they're willing to admit this episode
48:26 165 from season 2 which is my second
48:29 moon hoax episode it's linked to on a
48:32 bunch of web pages out there and it just
48:36 blows me away that that's the case
48:37 because I don't do anything to promote
48:39 but that video two years ago was
48:42 probably around twenty eight thousand
48:44 five hundred views two years ago so I
48:48 was always excited you know when he had
48:49 a new milestone when it's 30,000 he's
48:51 finally going to gun over 30,000 but he
48:55 gets pounded it's my number one episode
48:57 but if I go on statistics or the
48:59 analytics and I say lifetime analytics
49:02 give me my top viewed video it'll tell
49:05 me that videos just crawl barely over
49:07 30,000 in 2019 but when I switch it back
49:11 to 28 days which is the last month of
49:15 viewing
49:16 that video has received 2,500 views in
49:20 28 days we'll do a little bit of math on
49:24 that right in one month it gets viewed
49:26 2,500 times but two years ago had it
49:30 even received 1,500 views between two
49:32 years ago and today it would have
49:34 crossed 30,000 way back in 2017 so they
49:39 are manipulating those votes I that
49:41 video must have 60 to 70 thousand views
49:44 40 of which have been stolen so when you
49:48 see this channel if you're passing it on
49:50 to other people say this content freaks
49:53 the deep state out let's just put it
49:55 that way right all right back to our
49:58 episode the subject of haunted houses -
50:04 sort of because it's sort of in the
50:06 category this whole thing right haunting
50:08 doesn't have to be evil as long as
50:11 there's nothing bad happening to you and
50:12 you don't perceive it as a threat you
50:14 don't perceive it as evil but of course
50:17 if you have beings that are sort of in
50:19 this weird almost reality and you sense
50:23 them in some way shape or form it's
50:26 frightening it's on it's the unknown and
50:28 that the unknown is pure fear if you
50:30 really just do some basic math on a rate
50:32 for the consciousness of a man mankind I
50:36 was told I forgot who told me this
50:39 particular story but there's the act of
50:43 burning sage and the people who believe
50:47 in this and I have no opinion personally
50:49 I think sage smells awful but maybe
50:52 that's why it has the effect it has who
50:55 knows right and if you think about ether
50:57 all winds and you think about
50:58 frequencies of energy and burning and
51:01 transforming into all kinds of different
51:03 energy speeds and species then if
51:06 there's any form of ether all existence
51:09 to the other side that they have to
51:11 manipulate it to be in my existence
51:12 right the cat thing is physically
51:15 happening if the butt print is actually
51:16 happening in Paris and you could film it
51:20 then it has to be manipulating our world
51:24 so sage might neutralize their access to
51:29 this realm based on this theory
51:31 but the the act of burning sage is
51:35 something that I've seen it in gosh I
51:38 mean I know people who do it for a
51:40 living
51:40 I know of people that do it for them I'm
51:42 like not any friends of mine or
51:44 acquaintances in mine but you've seen it
51:46 I saw it on one show where this guy was
51:47 a house flipper it was a stager flipper
51:50 guy and he would do it and he looked
51:52 it's so atypical of being kind of a sage
51:57 burn he was like a really clean cut gay
51:58 guy and for some reason that doesn't you
52:01 know I'm always thinking some woman
52:02 who's kind of a hippie kind of you know
52:05 crystal kind of person's guy had no
52:08 visible attributes of being your typical
52:11 person who believes in that but he did
52:13 and he would hold a little prayer
52:16 session and burn sage to clean the house
52:19 and so I see that and I'm like I'm
52:21 shocked I'm like wow people really take
52:24 that seriously I have no opinion I mean
52:26 what could I do what could I say but I
52:29 heard a very impressive story there was
52:34 a very rich Arab Sheik an oil guy he
52:40 could only assume that he has
52:44 inexhaustible amounts of money but he
52:46 bought this home I believe in Malibu and
52:50 it was a gigantic 35,000 square foot
52:54 plus home on the beach and I saw a
52:58 picture of it when the person was
53:00 telling me this story I can't remember
53:04 exactly which person told me the story
53:07 but they was shocked did this actually
53:10 crosses the Arab belief system and it
53:14 could be a modern thing that they've
53:15 adapted to or it could be something that
53:18 Arabs believe if you know about this
53:20 belief in the Arab culture please share
53:22 what you know
53:23 let me just didn't any ones take on this
53:26 whole thing but they have a guy that
53:30 they use and he's not American but he's
53:33 not Arab either but they pay this guy to
53:38 come in and burn sage in at least a
53:41 month ahead of time if not more
53:44 to clean the whole house out of all of
53:46 the previous history sort of like the
53:48 shining with the Overlook Hotel right is
53:52 you know Scatman Crothers you played
53:55 that dude I was talking to the kid he
53:57 said and I cannot shake this definition
54:01 because I believe it makes a lot of
54:04 sense with ether all technology ether
54:07 understanding of the universe but he
54:09 says he says it's he was trying to
54:12 explain why the Overlook Hotel created
54:15 all the images that the kid might be
54:17 seeing cuz he says I don't know what
54:19 you're seeing but if you're gonna stay
54:20 here with your parents through the
54:22 winter you're likely to see things and I
54:25 want you to understand what you're
54:27 seeing because he says he was asking the
54:30 kid about his little imaginary friend he
54:32 says well does he does he show you
54:34 things you know and he says like
54:36 pictures in a book you know and so he
54:39 said well it's kind of like when someone
54:41 burns toast he says I forgot how he put
54:46 the put the phrase but he said you know
54:48 you clean up the toast and you throw it
54:50 away and it's gone but you can still
54:52 smell the burnt toast in the room for
54:55 quite a while and so what he was trying
54:57 to say it was events will have occurred
54:59 in this hotel that were crazy nutty but
55:04 you'll still see the echoes of these
55:06 events until they burn completely off
55:08 apparently the Overlook Hotel was
55:11 phenomenal at keeping the echoes from
55:13 the past and the fictional story The
55:15 Shining so this guy is hired to sage
55:19 this house the big old house takes him a
55:21 long time you know more I think about
55:23 the story I think it was like a
55:24 six-month stay or something crazy but
55:28 the guy starts burning and there was
55:30 some death that had occurred in the
55:32 house I want to say it was like a murder
55:35 or something had it happened in the
55:37 house but this guy gets so freaked out
55:43 and I think within 45 days he left and
55:48 he told the Arab who owned it he said
55:51 you were not to move in this house you
55:54 were to sell it at immediately those
55:56 places
55:58 evil and that's a very expensive problem
56:02 to have right at 35,000 square foot
56:05 house on the beach of Malibu and again
56:08 I'm I was shown pictures of it this is
56:10 how this story was told to me because he
56:12 was it was a girl was dealing with she
56:14 had her own gigantic house I remember
56:16 who told me yeah she had her own 35,000
56:19 square foot house before I met her but
56:23 you know that's gonna cost I don't know
56:25 100 million dollars 50 million dollars
56:28 somewhere in there it's gonna be really
56:29 super expensive and too short sell it
56:31 really fast you know people gonna ask
56:34 questions but at least the guy was from
56:36 another country and so hopefully when he
56:38 had to resell the place he could just
56:40 say I just decided not to move out of my
56:42 home country or something like that I
56:43 found a better deal so if we didn't lose
56:45 all of his money not that he cares but
56:50 the idea of the haunted house is
56:53 intriguing isn't it what would cause
56:55 such a thing to occur and I know there's
56:57 a million programs to talk about this
56:59 kind of thing and people who have put
57:01 their whole life into it like Dan
57:03 Aykroyd it would probably talk for five
57:06 hours with much more education than
57:07 myself about the subject but you know if
57:11 you lived in a home your whole life the
57:13 majority of your life and then you pass
57:16 away in your home you may be so accustom
57:22 and so attached to it but even though
57:26 you're offered the freedom of going some
57:28 other place in the universe and starting
57:30 over
57:30 you may need more time who knows how
57:35 much time you would need now I think the
57:39 facts are that the accusations of homes
57:46 being haunted have a couple different
57:48 attributes about them just you know
57:50 being a layman analyzing this one it
57:54 typically is more associated with the
57:56 older a building is and there's so many
58:00 hoaxes online that it's hard to point
58:02 towards anything I mean I've seen you
58:04 know around Halloween time the news will
58:06 actually chime in and give you a few
58:08 hundred house stories and
58:10 and they'll rush into a home I think you
58:12 know I've even had when I was a kid I I
58:15 didn't realize I was being had but they
58:17 were creating fake haunted house
58:19 things are moving candlesticks around it
58:21 was all fake and it was just like
58:22 tracking Santa Claus at Christmastime
58:24 right on a radar so so that would seem
58:29 to be consistent with the notion in a
58:31 place that has had more people live in
58:33 it but have more opportunities to have
58:36 one something unfortunate does occur
58:38 someone passes away in a weird way some
58:41 people just could live there their whole
58:43 life if the house is 400 years old well
58:45 you have several opportunities for
58:46 someone to live a full life in that
58:48 particular destination and then get
58:51 attached to it the funny question is is
58:55 what would happen if two families wanted
58:59 to battle it out for a place right
59:01 they're both dying in the location and
59:03 now they both want to live there it'd be
59:06 an interesting story right but you
59:09 seldom ever hear about the condo that's
59:12 15 years old being haunted it hasn't had
59:16 enough life then there's the sort of
59:20 other story arc idea that you'll hear
59:23 about but you don't really hear about
59:24 this other idea except for in movies
59:26 unless you can tell me different which
59:29 is that you have hallowed ground in
59:33 poltergeist it was that they moved the
59:35 tombstones of a cemetery but didn't move
59:38 the bodies and then they built a giant
59:39 tract house community on it and so for
59:43 whatever reason the epicenter was over
59:45 the house that the stories told on it
59:47 didn't seem like anyone else was having
59:48 issues until the end of the movie which
59:51 you know technically if you were to take
59:54 the theory of the movie everyone would
59:56 be having haunted house experiences then
59:59 you have Indian burial grounds which are
60:01 very romantic because Native Americans
60:05 were very mother earth very bound to the
60:08 earth and they have very strict rules
60:10 about what happens to you when you pass
60:11 away and how your soul is there ready to
60:13 go we're not ready to go I think that's
60:16 fascinating but the math on it would be
60:20 fascinating to really
60:22 study which would be to say if you were
60:25 to take all of the homes where people
60:27 died weird ways and so you have like say
60:31 you have a map and you have like little
60:33 little blue dots everywhere where
60:35 something has tragically occurred in a
60:37 particular location you could probably
60:40 cross-reference a database someone
60:43 commits suicide someone is murdered
60:45 something like that maybe even a young
60:48 child someone who has a lot of life left
60:50 right and then you overlay a second tier
60:53 on top of that well you have yeah where
60:56 people have reported hunting's and see
61:00 if you have a one-to-one correlation
61:02 with a blue dot and let's say a red dot
61:05 the red dot is a report of a haunting do
61:08 you have homes that are reported as
61:11 having hauntings that have no tragic
61:14 pass to them or maybe we even have a
61:18 light qualification which is maybe a
61:20 purple dot which is someone was simply
61:23 just really old and had lived the
61:26 majority if not all of her life at a
61:27 particular location be fascinating
61:30 metric to see right in one of those
61:32 little VR maps right there AR maps I you
61:37 know when I was a young man I used to
61:40 toy with the notion of seeing ghosts
61:43 because I always wanted to see one you
61:44 know real apparition my eyes are wide
61:46 open I'm looking into a darkness and I
61:48 wanted to see something and it's
61:51 absolutely never taken place whatsoever
61:53 but I used to sit as a kid probably even
61:56 into my 20s from time to time when I
61:58 remember to go through this ritual
62:02 because you know you know I won't lie I
62:04 definitely you know speak in one
62:07 direction towards individuals that I
62:09 believe are capable of listening to me
62:12 don't know if they're there never anyone
62:14 talk back if they if but they did I'd
62:17 probably freak out but I would sit in my
62:21 bedroom and sit in my bed and I'd stare
62:22 at the wall and lights around and so
62:24 it's not completely black but it's
62:26 definitely dark as hell
62:27 and in my mind scientifically my thought
62:30 was well I will invite anyone who's
62:32 present in fact I resurrected this
62:35 ritual after I
62:36 Oh Walt that was like dude you only eat
62:38 miles away come on over in my house it's
62:40 chill out but I would say okay if you
62:43 can anybody who wants to and are usually
62:47 saying with like God's permission I
62:49 don't want much of demons in my room if
62:51 such things exist I'd say okay
62:53 manipulate some light take my door which
62:56 is not completely closed and close it
62:58 which would probably freak me out
62:59 because of the sound and stuff I'd beg
63:02 them to do anything move something make
63:05 a light you know disturb a third the
63:08 point does a photon wave and so I can
63:10 see it it never happened
63:13 never ever happen and you can think of a
63:15 million reasons why that wouldn't happen
63:17 even if they could but if ghosts were
63:21 common to any degree especially with us
63:25 with cell phones and that kind of thing
63:27 security cameras now again there's a
63:29 weird video sequence at Disneyland which
63:32 is it's either the most elaborate hoax
63:36 ever or it's real one or the other it's
63:42 two primary camera angles but there was
63:44 a what happened was this is the way that
63:48 hit the net so you know the security
63:50 centers have cameras all over any
63:53 location that is being filmed and so
63:54 you'll have like several monitors with
63:57 all the cameras and there's supposed to
63:58 be a security guy looking at the
63:59 monitors well right around the haunted
64:02 mansion which for those of you who may
64:04 not have been to Disneyland
64:05 I don't can't remember how this in your
64:07 world is organized in this particular
64:08 area but it's again Disneyland is the
64:12 only place the Walt Disney ever went to
64:13 because all the other parks didn't exist
64:16 and even though he planned is any world
64:18 it didn't get finished it didn't even
64:21 break ground until after his death but
64:25 there's a kind of a cobblestone road
64:28 that goes right up to the to the mansion
64:30 and then you go backwards and there's a
64:32 big line there the roads probably about
64:36 I'd say six mile see 70 or 80 feet I
64:41 think as it winds up to the house but on
64:44 this first camera is this all of a
64:48 sudden you see a humanoid walking
64:50 apparition walking out of the haunted
64:55 mansion
64:55 you don't necessarily come out of the
64:57 building but you see about and about
64:59 halfway down the walkway you start
65:01 seeing this humanoid character walking
65:02 and then there's a second camera which
65:06 is filming the New Orleans grounds and
65:09 out over the water towards that
65:11 steamboat that's always parked over
65:13 there by frontier land it's kind of the
65:14 joint where eventually in Frontierland
65:17 hit each other by Tom so Tom Sawyer's
65:19 Island but this apparition continues to
65:22 walk through the stone ground towards
65:28 the water edge now if you're thinking
65:31 well maybe the cameras like one of those
65:33 old 50s cameras where it's always
65:35 apparitions if it moves too quick this
65:38 isn't in that era these are in
65:40 crystal-clear camera era right and this
65:43 thing is definitely an apparition of
65:45 some sort I mean even if someone's
65:46 creating the special effect it's it was
65:49 brilliantly done but the second it steps
65:51 out at one camera it goes into the other
65:53 camera and there's a little bit of a
65:57 pause because there's a space between
65:58 the two cameras but this character
66:04 continues to walk and then it walks
66:06 through the little barrier that protects
66:09 you from walking into the water and then
66:11 it walks out over the water towards the
66:14 steamboat and it sort of vanishes and so
66:18 you know if I were to watch that in any
66:20 other scenario without my personal
66:21 experience there I'd say I you know
66:24 someone did some special effect or you
66:25 know maybe it's real whatever but now
66:27 I'm like holy crap maybe that's real you
66:32 know but for any of you who've had to
66:35 experience especially for those of you
66:37 who know you're not ghost story telling
66:40 people it's a weird thing I mean it
66:44 really changes your perspective even if
66:46 you believed in a God and an afterlife
66:48 or reincarnation or whatever you believe
66:50 before as much as you might be
66:52 determined to believe that seeing or
66:57 experiencing something it totally
67:01 changes the game
67:03 and you know I'll meet new people and
67:05 tell them that story if the conversation
67:07 goes that we're having fun you know and
67:09 I know that they're looking at me if
67:11 they haven't had that experience they'd
67:12 look at me and they're like maybe is
67:14 nuts you know he's a little bit of nuts
67:16 in him or maybe he's one of those guys
67:17 that needs attention and it's such a sad
67:20 thing to see in the back of their eyes
67:21 cuz you're like God if you could just
67:24 step into my consciousness and ride
67:27 shotgun for even five seconds you would
67:30 know one I'm telling you the truth but
67:32 two I'm not that kind of guy at all I
67:36 mean if I I don't know what it would
67:38 take for me to be that kind of guy or
67:40 any of us to transform from not
67:42 necessarily believe in any of stuff to
67:44 being going around old it's totally
67:46 different guys everybody you got to hear
67:47 this step around you know I guess it
67:49 would be you see dead people I mean you
67:51 would see spirits all the time and then
67:56 I've experimented with the notion
67:58 because I write stories that imagine
68:04 that here's that here's the kind of
68:06 scenario I've toyed with on my mind
68:08 which is somewhat because if you watch I
68:11 think it's called oh God with John
68:14 Denver and George Burns where George
68:16 Burns plays God Vegas 1979 78 somewhere
68:21 in there and he just shows up to John
68:24 Denver who's a total atheist in this
68:25 movie and he's telling him you know you
68:29 gotta do some stuff for me and you know
68:30 John Denver's like seriously you know
68:33 old man get away from me and he realized
68:36 this no one can see him I think he's at
68:37 a shopping center is like at a grocery
68:39 store or something and no one can see
68:41 the old guy and he's like you don't see
68:43 that dude you know like are you okay and
68:45 he finally starts believing right and I
68:48 think they did Oh God part two as well
68:49 it created some wild movement but be fun
68:53 to see that movie
68:54 so I took my first date when I was 9
68:56 years old Derby Kansas but I toyed with
69:00 the idea that it's because we would talk
69:03 too much about it that they don't do
69:05 this but it also affirms your belief in
69:09 the afterlife and it also reveals it
69:12 would reveal if you had like a George
69:14 Burns experience with this full
69:15 flesh-and-blood
69:17 characters fully opaque and and talking
69:20 to you you would change your entire
69:23 ecosystem how you view the universe and
69:25 then you would be privileged with part
69:27 of the matrix right you know how this
69:29 thing works you know the thresholds at
69:31 least a lot more than you would prior to
69:33 the experience but say you have a hero
69:36 of your someone could be your relative
69:39 could be someone who's famous you never
69:41 met you want to meet Nikola Tesla and
69:44 you go into your living room and you're
69:46 in this let's say you're in a Tesla mode
69:49 you've filled your house with a lot of
69:51 his paraphernalia or research or
69:54 whatever which is hard to do right let's
69:56 say you did that and then you walk into
70:02 your front room and he's sitting in one
70:04 of your chairs and just sitting in his
70:07 really cool you know like you always saw
70:09 him in the pictures and he's just he's
70:11 ready he's ready to talk to you and so
70:15 you have this giant conversation with
70:16 him well what would be two factors that
70:18 would endanger the rest of the world
70:21 that is not believing in this and thus
70:23 maybe living in a more blissful nature
70:25 because we're ignorant of these things
70:28 the debate is actually sort of healthy
70:30 right is there a god I don't know is it
70:32 natural if I don't know reincarnate I
70:34 don't know but it's just us out there in
70:37 front of you and said well you know I've
70:40 had a long time to think about all the
70:42 things I invented and I'm gonna give you
70:44 an invention or I'll tell answer any one
70:46 of your questions about what I invented
70:48 you're like hey do you did you invent
70:49 time travel then you know like all those
70:51 secret little things about it and you
70:53 find out all the truth and then you
70:56 start a little blog site on him and
70:58 you're like he didn't do this he did
70:59 that this is what this really meant
71:01 Potter by the way this was what was
71:03 destroyed this is what was found this is
71:04 always working on this is what he named
71:06 that pigeon or that Dovie fell in love
71:08 with in New York and whatever all the
71:10 mysteries of the guy would be unraveled
71:13 well that would obviously be some
71:15 temporal violation in history
71:23 but let's say that any one of us got
71:25 that much proof that this is occurring
71:29 would we incubate it but let's just say
71:33 we'll run through the scenario the
71:35 second type of scenario that occurs your
71:38 hero's sitting in the chair whoever that
71:39 is you have this big conversation and
71:42 they tell you well this is a one-time
71:45 thing
71:46 in fact the only guy I'd only got half
71:48 an hour so make it good takes a lot of
71:51 energy to do this I'm got permission to
71:53 do this once or whatever would we as
71:56 human beings deduce something else about
71:59 reality that we had never deduced before
72:03 because we never had the proof and would
72:06 that manifest into some other key that
72:08 can unlock something about this reality
72:10 the matrix the door to the dome or
72:13 whatever that would be dangerous for the
72:16 experiment that is humanity that is this
72:18 existence this matrix or whatever we're
72:21 in you know so in my with my experiences
72:27 in this and then my lack of experience
72:30 of it ever reoccurring at any type of
72:33 interval right don't you know I've got a
72:37 season pass now to Disneyland again
72:39 because I created this thing called a
72:41 flex pass which is much more reasonably
72:43 priced and it's it's it's pretty cool
72:45 but you have to know when I go there
72:48 what do you think I'm thinking of the
72:51 entire time I'm there I'm thinking you
72:54 know Walt come back up to me say
72:56 something else let's have another
72:57 experiment happen right that's what I'm
73:00 thinking
73:00 off and on while I'm there isn't that
73:04 wild
73:04 I've been permanently changed when I go
73:07 there when I said in my house and I I'll
73:11 get these urges to go there and I know
73:13 that you know a lot of people think Walt
73:15 was all this crazy stuff I guarantee you
73:17 he's probably clean as a whistle but
73:19 people got around him and you know the
73:23 more they got around him that's really
73:25 around the time he died you know club 33
73:28 was being built the year that he died
73:31 okay wasn't even open yet okay but like
73:35 I said I go there and I look
73:37 between all the sponsorships I look at
73:39 the places where he personally crafted
73:43 buildings he personally wrote on rides
73:45 you know if you go to the Peter Pan ride
73:47 there's photographs of him on every one
73:49 of those seats making sure they were
73:52 built perfectly and you know they're the
73:55 same seats as I understand it they feel
73:59 like the same seats trust me and you
74:02 know I'm just gonna throw this out there
74:03 as a sort of a like-minded experiment or
74:07 experience for those of you remember the
74:09 movie et back in the day and you know I
74:12 don't think I've seen that movie all the
74:14 way through since 1982
74:17 maybe 84 tops back probably 84 I was
74:21 doing a bunch of paintings of et back in
74:22 the day when I was a kid but the way
74:26 that movie goes is that this little boy
74:27 has this alien land in his backyard
74:30 hides in the shed and they finally lure
74:32 him out of the shed with Reese's Pieces
74:34 right until he gets into the house and
74:37 they make friends with the guy and of
74:39 course they they dressed him up they
74:40 have all this fun and then eventually
74:41 the feds figured out where he was they
74:43 chased the kid and then I forgot what
74:47 happens but he dies temporarily et he
74:50 turns pure snow white and when they
74:53 covered his house with all the hazmat
74:55 stuff right and all these feds are
74:56 walking around these scientists are
74:58 walking around this fed dude shows up
75:01 and he goes into the tent where the et
75:04 body is being stored and I think the kid
75:06 is there looking at the dead et and of
75:10 course we're all dying inside when we
75:11 were kids that he died because it was
75:12 the cutest little thing right he's got a
75:14 menacing in a weird monster he kind of
75:17 way but what was the story for the fed
75:20 the story for the fed was that he I
75:23 think the insinuation was that he had
75:25 met et when he was a kid and he has been
75:29 involved with the extra-terrestrial
75:32 research for the government because he
75:34 saw it as a kid and he gravitated
75:36 towards that and got himself cute
75:37 clearance I guess and he just wanted to
75:40 see et one more time and so of course et
75:45 comes back to life and the kid pretends
75:47 to be crying it's one of the funniest
75:48 scenes ever and I think that's when they
75:51 steal him and put him in the bicycle
75:52 because when they fly through the moon I
75:54 think that's when that happens but
75:55 anyway you know let's say I lived to be
75:58 80 to 100 years old
76:01 Disneyland continues and I'm somehow
76:03 have access to this place it doesn't
76:07 matter how long I live every time I go
76:08 there I'll be thinking about that
76:10 experience and how real it was for me
76:12 and now I took my girlfriend walks
76:14 straight to this dude in the kiddy Park
76:16 area which I never go to and just just
76:19 exactly where the little pin in my head
76:21 was there's Bob gur staying in there
76:23 with his buddy I talked to Bob 10 years
76:25 later and he's like yeah I remember that
76:27 day this is crazy he said he's 85 but
76:30 I'm talking to him
76:31 10 years later even 86 I don't know but
76:36 he proceeds to tell me a bunch of other
76:37 stories where people appeared out of the
76:39 blue in his life and a bunch of other
76:41 weird things happen to him at Disneyland
76:43 so so you meet a like-minded persons
76:45 that the same experiences my buddy was a
76:47 security guy he had his experiences and
76:50 so we're all able to live life were able
76:54 to go on with our life it doesn't
76:56 paralyze you you know the government
76:58 stacked it but they can't tell us about
77:00 creatures from another planet
77:02 you know beings for another planet
77:04 because we're all gonna freak out way
77:05 you know maybe get a little bit of a
77:10 post Trump election crying but people
77:15 are gonna people are gonna be okay it's
77:17 interesting so I think that's about all
77:20 I have for that I want to know your
77:23 experiences and if you tell me about
77:26 your experience in the comment sections
77:28 and YouTube definitely tell me sort of
77:31 what kind of person you are you know
77:32 whether or not you've had billions of
77:35 these experiences or if it's like man I
77:37 would never have believed in this but
77:39 this happened to me and if you could
77:43 make distinctions between your relatives
77:46 versus maybe your heroes like again
77:50 Walt's one of my heroes in terms of his
77:53 tenacity to create the impossible if you
77:55 read his whole life story it's it was a
77:58 tough tough road from the very beginning
78:01 I think he only really got a reprieve
78:04 about the time you start
78:05 the park where money was so plentiful he
78:08 could do what he wanted without begging
78:09 bankers but then the third category
78:12 would be utter random things random
78:16 events anyone that you know that you
78:18 like I gave those examples I will only
78:21 ever give you examples for people that I
78:23 believe are programmed to not believe in
78:27 this sort of thing because I think those
78:29 are the most credible for my personality
78:30 personally so lament wax poetic on this
78:37 whole thing in the comment section
78:39 because I want to hear it
78:42 if you haven't been to deep thoughts
78:44 radio.com please go it has all the feeds
78:46 there's two video you bit shoot is about
78:50 this is um this is a early October it's
78:54 about to hit season five so very soon
78:57 here probably by the time this episode
78:59 hits season 5 will be 100% up to date on
79:01 [ __ ] shoots and go either place to
79:04 watch it you get it in 4k on YouTube so
79:07 it's cool plus any of you like to really
79:08 leave comments that are seen by
79:10 thousands of people YouTube still the
79:13 Plus best place to do it but there's two
79:16 options for our audio so if you're a
79:18 podcast you can get this in two seconds
79:20 on the website there's two social media
79:22 twitter is just a place to find the
79:24 feeds if that's where you tend to go I'd
79:27 recommend you get off Twitter because
79:28 it's just nothing but total darkness we
79:31 have a locked Facebook group which is
79:32 really fun we're starting to get some
79:34 more members requests in so it's cool
79:36 but this is where you can share all
79:38 kinds of stuff I mean any belief system
79:40 you have will be respected you know just
79:43 don't be thin-skinned but there's a
79:47 couple of ways to donate to the page
79:48 there's a PayPal link with someone
79:50 finally used thank you so much and there
79:53 is a patreon page so you can set up for
79:56 a monthly little donation if you want I
80:00 forget to mention too the thing about
80:01 patreon is that the second I upload it
80:04 from my computer I put it on patreon I
80:08 may actually change that policy just a
80:10 little bit I might let it fully encode
80:12 before I let you have the link that way
80:15 when you see my post you can click on an
80:17 immediately plays and
80:18 that can be a few hours before I give it
80:21 to the world or it can be days before I
80:23 give it to the world so if you want to
80:26 be on the inside you can do it and you
80:28 know I'm there if you want to it's it's
80:30 a much smaller audience so if any of you
80:32 send me a message and because I know
80:33 you're donating to be there I'm
80:35 definitely gonna give you some priority
80:36 to answer any of your questions or reply
80:39 to you guys in it by the way if there's
80:41 anything you guys want on patreon that
80:45 I'm not giving you just let me know
80:46 I don't currently engage the tears
80:49 because I I kind of have a love/hate
80:53 situation with the tier idea that if you
80:55 give me so much money I'll do something
80:56 really special for you it makes sense I
80:59 just feel like that's a bit on the
81:01 extortion side so don't get mad at me
81:04 it's just I'm still trying to
81:06 emotionally deal with that I really do
81:08 that but I would like to get to a
81:09 donation level where you know we can do
81:11 face to face chats and stuff and we get
81:14 to know each other a little bit better
81:15 and you can ask me some questions so if
81:18 any thoughts about that let me know what
81:20 you'd be willing to part with to do
81:21 something like that there's an all-new
81:25 remastered season 1 again this channel
81:27 does not have season 1 published any
81:30 more it's there an unlisted forum so
81:32 people who have linked my videos all
81:34 over the web for season 1 they're still
81:36 working they're working just fine again
81:38 the reason why season 1 was remastered
81:40 the number one reason was that I used
81:43 music from my collection in my computer
81:47 to intro the episodes but I didn't
81:50 realize that the record companies were
81:52 going to steal all the revenue and have
81:54 the videos blocked in other countries so
81:57 the main thing was not really the money
81:59 it was Germany won't allow or American
82:02 companies wala Germans to see stuff with
82:05 their revenue streams or whatever the
82:07 stupid idea is but the other thing too
82:09 is that episodes like gun control or
82:12 completely banned worldwide so I posted
82:16 that on bit shoot and it is one of the
82:19 number one viewed videos on butch bit
82:21 shoot in fact I think it's my number one
82:22 video on [ __ ] shoot in fact it is right
82:24 now it's gun control so if you want to
82:27 see some of the episodes uncensored
82:30 definitely go over to [ __ ]
82:32 shoot so I'm going to loop back through
82:35 and make sure I don't think anything's
82:36 been banned on the season one because
82:38 it's all proprietary music that they
82:41 don't have access to legal legally and
82:45 but if they do start banning things I
82:47 will start swapping the feed on the
82:49 website to the bit shoot feed which is a
82:53 nice 1080p version of everything so
82:56 anyway I appreciate all you guys viewing
82:57 the channel to all the newcomers welcome
82:59 welcome just know it's a variety show
83:01 it's gonna have exactly what you want
83:03 sometimes and other times I'm going to
83:05 be posting stuff that'll make you wonder
83:07 why you're here so just hang on a video
83:10 will come in that you love trust me so
83:14 anyway take care of yourself and someone
83:16 else and I'll see in the next deep
83:17 thoughts over now
