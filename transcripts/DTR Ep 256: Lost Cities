00:00 [Music]
00:35 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:37 gentlemen this is actually a Thursday
00:41 morning and not a random evening I'm
00:46 here at the smoke shop smoking a little
00:50 Fuente a58 green label a green wrapper
00:56 rather I thought the day we would go
01:00 over something that I've been fairly
01:01 passionate about talking about which are
01:05 lost cities because I think that there's
01:09 a couple angles that no one really talks
01:12 about I have seen dozens and dozens of
01:15 specials on TV from Discovery to sci-fi
01:18 the History Channel discussing lost
01:21 cities because it is a it's a very
01:27 enchanting idea for us movie series like
01:31 Indiana Jones are sort of all about
01:33 finding lost cities right whether
01:36 they're looking to find a Holy Grail net
01:38 lost city or Excalibur by the way if
01:42 when I first moved to Los Angeles
01:45 probably a couple years after moved to
01:47 Los Angeles a friend of a friend was
01:50 writing the next Indiana Jones he was
01:54 working with Spielberg steam and all
01:57 these other folks and he was writing it
01:58 about Excalibur and then it never
02:01 happened very interesting but lost
02:05 cities lost cities are the closest thing
02:07 that we have on earth of visiting
02:10 another civilization sort of
02:12 another planet right our dream
02:15 what is our dream when it comes to lost
02:17 cities well we want to find a city
02:21 that's completely intact don't we I mean
02:24 you know you just move that stone you go
02:27 down some ivory steps and you know the
02:32 ultimate fantasy is they're still living
02:34 there somehow
02:35 or it has been a time capsule and the
02:40 amount of spiders in theirs
02:42 very remote isn't it funny how we we
02:48 accept spiderwebs and cobwebs on movie
02:53 sets as this romantic indicator of Bali
02:56 no one's been here in a really long time
02:59 but you can go up in your attic or some
03:02 cellar or something in real life that
03:06 has not been disturbed for decades and
03:08 there's absolutely none of that but
03:11 there spiders down there that's really
03:14 funny i was just i can't remember what
03:16 OS watching stranger things season two
03:19 and there's a scene where they go into a
03:22 building that probably hasn't been
03:25 visited for at least half a decade and
03:28 the place is covered up like it's 900
03:29 years old it's just really cute how we
03:33 allowed that to happen right then within
03:36 lost cities it's you know i could
03:39 probably call it the lost city promise
03:40 but within the lost city category we
03:43 have places that we discover like machu
03:51 picchu where it's in the most remote
03:56 location you could possibly imagine
03:58 it is built out of stones that aren't
04:02 necessarily from the top of the mountain
04:04 and then on top of all that if those
04:09 first two accomplishments weren't
04:11 interesting enough the craftsmanship
04:15 exceeds what the natives are able to do
04:21 today right the the pre inca
04:25 Faye's that built machu picchu and then
04:30 we have the other cities and like
04:36 Atlantis Atlantis is a city that has
04:45 been discussed by Plato and it is
04:52 fascinating how you will watch a
04:54 one-hour special about Atlantis and they
04:59 don't know anything about the place
05:00 other than a few kind of loose
05:04 references about where it is there's a
05:08 bunch of loose references about how much
05:10 more advanced they were than the current
05:12 population right not more advanced than
05:16 we are and 2018 by no means but I'm
05:22 wondering if something goes deeper than
05:23 that because what's fascinating about
05:26 Atlantis is that you know they talk
05:31 about the circles inside the circles and
05:33 but they don't really lament at how
05:36 advanced they were they don't talk about
05:39 flying around the planet they don't talk
05:43 about being seven miles down into the
05:46 ocean and I think that we don't put
05:49 together enough of the kind of basic
05:52 implications of people talking about
05:55 this place and what would have really
05:57 occurred had there been a place like
05:59 this and yet man so wants to believe in
06:04 this that I think that there might be a
06:07 seed within our hearts that almost
06:13 beckons back to something that really
06:15 was like this and that's kind of
06:19 esoteric right so let me explain that
06:22 what if let's just say the deep state
06:28 gets their their way and that would mean
06:31 that the world would suck it would be
06:33 literally thx 1 3 8 fascist slave
06:39 driven world there is no more art
06:42 there's no more expression there is no
06:45 comedy if anything there is drama and
06:49 suffering 99.9% of the world as the as
06:55 the Georgia Guidestones recommends would
06:58 be completely wiped off off this planet
07:00 some horrible flu some Zika virus all
07:02 this kind of stuff they get their way
07:04 nobody stands up and knocks him back
07:07 nobody nobody fights them we all coward
07:10 down while our neighbors are being
07:11 destroyed we just sit here do nothing
07:14 until they destroy us
07:15 okay and this factors in - I think the
07:22 whole mythos of missing cities and again
07:26 I'm talking about cities that really
07:28 have been missing lost cities and I'm
07:30 talking about the myths of lost cities
07:33 which may be real it may not be true but
07:36 let's just say that the amazing level of
07:40 creativity that we have at least from I
07:45 would say the mid 70s to at least the
07:49 mid 80s let's just say that era didn't
07:51 get extinguished and it kept going
07:54 there's been great things after it but
07:55 it definitely has slowed down over time
07:58 but let's just say our society for a
08:00 thousand years had great comedians great
08:04 singers great bands great actors great
08:06 writers of poetry and you know film and
08:13 TV the greatest stuff you love today
08:17 you're Game of Thrones there's 20 of
08:20 those shows over the course of a
08:21 millennium and then while we're
08:24 distracted with our entertainment we
08:27 slip we slip and these folks finally
08:32 sees us right maybe they do it through
08:35 some Skynet robot system some
08:39 sociopathic Boston Dynamics Rothschild
08:43 decides
08:45 you know nobody likes me I don't get
08:47 invited to parties so I'm gonna destroy
08:49 the world with my money because there's
08:52 too many left brain scientists that
08:54 can't view the world in any other
08:56 capacity they end up inadvertently
08:58 helping them but our genes inside of us
09:03 even though they're able to overnight
09:05 pull this off and even though there is
09:08 at least one or two generations that
09:10 remember the world with art an
09:13 expression and freedom we slip into this
09:19 tyrannical crazy world fascist world
09:23 enabled by groups like Ann Tifa and then
09:27 we start living decade to decade
09:29 hundreds of years century to century in
09:31 this horrible world but because we live
09:36 thousands of years before that with
09:38 freedom and expression and art our true
09:42 purpose and being engineered as human
09:44 beings we feel it were in that world
09:50 were in that world and we feel it so
09:54 there's this weird suspicion in us
09:57 wasn't the world different I can feel it
10:01 we didn't used to be in white clothing
10:05 we used to wear colors we used to grow
10:07 our hair up we didn't we weren't all
10:10 bald we didn't work at the factory I
10:14 feel like we were outside I feel like
10:16 there's this thing called the Sun that's
10:18 warm and loving instead of these
10:20 fluorescent lights we would feel our
10:24 genetics pushing through that tyrannical
10:27 barrier I just think we wouldn't and a
10:30 part of me is suspicious that maybe
10:32 these lost cities including lost
10:36 technology might be us harkening back to
10:40 a time when we remember the world before
10:43 monarchies the world before banks the
10:46 world before something is ugly as debt
10:48 and taxes we are way too complicit in
10:52 our own slavery in my opinion we accept
10:56 it because we're born into it and were
10:58 told from the very
10:59 beginning by our controllers there's
11:01 there are taxes there are taxes there is
11:05 debt you not only are in debt as an
11:09 individual but your family's in debt
11:10 your city's in debt your estates in debt
11:13 and your government's in debt debt debt
11:16 debt debt debt and what was deemed the
11:20 most blasphemous behavior 2,000 years
11:23 ago which was Ussery which was compound
11:26 interest you realize a credit card was
11:28 the most if you had a credit card back
11:30 in the time of the fabled myth of Jesus
11:35 you had a plastic piece of the devil and
11:39 you would be punished more for having
11:42 that card and being or sorry being
11:45 responsible for processing that card
11:47 then you would be to say that God didn't
11:50 exist which was classic definition of
11:52 blasphemy I stress this because I think
11:57 it's fascinating that there are folks
12:00 that are so addicted to the notion and
12:06 and I'm not criticizing by the way I
12:09 think it's actually fairly fascinating
12:10 and I'm gonna tie it to something a
12:12 little more fascinating I think which is
12:14 why I'm making this show because I'm not
12:16 going to teach you anything about
12:17 Atlantis or lumeria or any of these lost
12:21 cities that are more mythos based then
12:24 you would learn watching a great
12:25 documentary on YouTube a great document
12:27 on the History Channel or whatever
12:29 discovery some of Graham Hancock's work
12:33 etc I'm bringing you an angle that I
12:36 don't think anyone's really talked about
12:38 ever if you've ever done douve into this
12:42 lost city realm of research you will
12:46 have run into classic members that claim
12:50 to have channeled spirits from those
12:56 eras and there there are classic
13:00 individuals from over a hundred years
13:03 ago that have been claiming to channel
13:07 these individuals from these foreign
13:10 locations
13:12 and I don't know you know I mean like we
13:15 could probably come up with an episode
13:16 that's just on channeling I'd have to do
13:18 a little bit of research as to when
13:20 someone first started this idea that
13:25 that an individual could start speaking
13:27 on behalf of a spirit that has already
13:29 passed and for those of you who haven't
13:32 been familiarized with channeling
13:34 because you're probably going what do
13:35 you mean changing the channel on the TV
13:37 it just means someone who acts as a
13:40 vessel for a spirit that has moved on so
13:44 they get possessed by this spirit that
13:46 appears to be hanging out somewhere and
13:49 you know New Jersey and they talk about
13:53 what what has happened now there's
13:58 there's also a couple different types of
14:00 channeling that I'm familiar with and
14:02 the medium they also call the mediums
14:05 because the individuals pretty much like
14:07 the Phonographic needle touching the
14:09 record and therefore they're the speaker
14:12 that is bringing through the the idea
14:15 that someone is communicating through
14:16 them the first principle of this
14:20 channeling thing is very very
14:21 interesting because it is used to create
14:25 conspiracy it is used to create
14:27 something where there was otherwise
14:29 nothing for those of you who have gotten
14:32 into Planet X and Nibiru the way that it
14:38 takes root in the mythos of conspiracy
14:41 is that someone claims to be channeling
14:44 alien beings from another planet into
14:48 this world so we could listen to what
14:49 they're talking about it's a very
14:52 dangerous scam to pull off because you
14:56 are then responsible for continuing the
15:00 narrative of great detail right if
15:03 someone sits down in front of me and
15:04 says they're gonna channel someone from
15:06 Atlantis I'm going to ask them the most
15:12 arcane minutiae of living in Atlantis
15:16 how do you bathe in the morning you know
15:19 what do you eat if you're on an island
15:21 where do you get your food from do you
15:23 eat fish every single day
15:25 do you have livestock out there what is
15:28 your mode of transportation how does it
15:31 work
15:31 who was the individual that invented
15:34 that how about the individual that
15:35 invented this what's your neighbor's
15:36 name what do you do when you get sick
15:40 what medicine do you take you and of
15:44 course they're gonna say we never gonna
15:45 think but you never hear those details
15:48 you always hear really broad-stroke
15:50 things because that's how the toasts are
15:54 created when people tell me oh my gosh
15:58 if you're seeing that the day to day and
16:01 then you every read revelations and it's
16:03 all coming true well it's pretty easy
16:05 when it's all pretty generic arcs of
16:07 life arcs of society you know a bad
16:11 man's coming and bad things will happen
16:13 well then you start looking around for
16:15 something that you can label as bad then
16:18 again if you search out for negativity
16:20 you will be given negativity right but
16:23 most of the references to Atlantis were
16:26 at a time when the Greek universities
16:29 were at their absolute peak then you had
16:33 you know people with virtually infinite
16:37 money talking about these cities that
16:41 were ancient and gone it was a tale was
16:47 a tall tale at the time that the stuff
16:49 was told one of the sort of oxymorons of
16:55 these lost cities is that they're
16:58 supposedly built out of folks that have
17:00 tremendous capabilities traveling the
17:02 world through either airplane or hot air
17:05 balloon or spaceship again it depends on
17:10 which person you're talking to which
17:11 person is to claims to have been
17:13 channeling the truth of this era but I
17:17 have this feeling that it is us reaching
17:21 back into our own genetic past to say we
17:24 were amazing we did have cities that
17:28 were fantastic and perhaps something
17:30 went wrong we lost control we trusted
17:34 people
17:35 how do bankers ever get the control over
17:39 us how does
17:39 anyone ever get control over us at the
17:41 very inception point it is us being good
17:44 and them being evil
17:46 so the idea of let's just say that a
17:49 channeler knows that they're complete
17:52 scam artists they have found a way to
17:54 take care of their retirement which is
17:56 to sit at home and craft up stories
17:58 about whatever and because it's not true
18:01 at all they simply have to make it make
18:03 sense don't cross any lines where you
18:06 contradict yourself keep everything
18:07 fairly generic basically take your palm
18:11 readers and your psychic you know cold
18:14 and hot readers those techniques that
18:16 have been around for thousands of years
18:17 and simply put them into a narrative of
18:20 a city now most of us if we could prove
18:23 that about someone we would really frown
18:25 on that capability on that on that not
18:28 the capability but on the intent to
18:30 deceive they're a scam artists they're
18:33 taking people's money hey what are they
18:35 taken they're taken nineteen dollars and
18:37 it's pretty much fictional entertainment
18:39 in a book maybe if you pay him like Bill
18:42 Clinton five hundred thousand dollars to
18:43 talk for twenty minutes then you've been
18:45 had but what would drive the person to
18:48 pick this subject matter in the first
18:50 place
18:51 it may be sheer scam it may be hey I got
18:54 this little thing here you know this
18:56 little thing I figured out these people
18:57 are gullible for this lost knowledge but
19:00 now you have to have a customer base
19:02 that's willing to take the risk in
19:05 believing you and then you have to have
19:06 a person who's going to pursue the scam
19:09 in the first place I'd like to suggest
19:12 that maybe both those individuals as
19:15 deluded or as sane as they might be may
19:18 simply be tracking back to a history
19:20 that they remember and their genetics we
19:23 were better than this we were free we
19:26 were great we elected to build pyramids
19:32 we built these Stonehenge things you
19:37 ever have a feeling that you know your
19:38 life just isn't right that it shouldn't
19:41 be the way that it is I think that's the
19:44 whole premise of those of us waking up
19:47 and I think for hundreds of years those
19:51 that have gained control over us through
19:53 the moneychangers the bankers that are
19:56 willing to create this user really
19:57 thumbs to destroy countries and
19:59 individuals they've always been able to
20:01 sort of you know ride the bull'
20:04 effortlessly as the bull bucks they're
20:06 just sitting there you know the Bulls
20:08 pretty big but they're three times
20:10 bigger through power and money and so
20:13 they just kind of move their hips a
20:15 little bit and keep you completely in
20:16 control but now the bull has grown the
20:21 Bulls the size of a city and they're the
20:24 size of a human being and they're
20:26 getting smaller by the second because
20:28 we're getting bigger but there's a part
20:31 of me that believes that we would have
20:37 more record of Atlantis on the mainland
20:41 people who have been there would come
20:44 back and draw it to be more than just a
20:47 slight reference to a place that they
20:49 heard about a long time ago now part of
20:52 the logic of having a special society a
20:55 lost city or a special city before it's
20:57 lost is to keep your in anima T to make
21:00 sure that the Horde doesn't come and
21:03 take you over because regardless of what
21:06 fortress you might build around your
21:08 city you know you can be overwhelmed by
21:10 numbers and so then concealing
21:13 themselves would be something that would
21:15 make sense however what always happens
21:18 with organizations like this once you do
21:21 achieve something wonderful something
21:23 powerful you typically leave behind
21:25 clues as to your existence and it's not
21:30 necessarily a clue that says hey we're
21:31 here in the ocean the clue is typically
21:34 something on the level of here's a
21:37 little piece of technology that we feel
21:40 could improve your life because we want
21:44 you to gain our abilities right I said a
21:48 long time ago on an episode I believe in
21:50 depopulation that the challenge we have
21:55 with Africa is that there's a little bit
21:58 of this in South America but it's very
22:00 minut in South America but in Africa you
22:03 have a population that has been largely
22:05 neglected by your
22:07 and so they have tribes that are
22:10 literally thousands of years behind
22:13 modern society and I mean I mean that by
22:17 its not a negative thing in all senses
22:20 because I think that they're balanced I
22:22 think that they wake up they hunt they
22:23 eat they have a wonderful life they have
22:26 rituals and wonderful things they don't
22:28 have a clue what nuclear powers built
22:32 out of but have a clue how to create an
22:35 integrated miniaturized microchip not a
22:38 clue
22:38 the conception of such a thing is not in
22:41 their in their lexicon in their mind and
22:43 again there's nothing really wrong with
22:46 that but if we want to integrate as a
22:47 society as a global society it's going
22:50 to be a problem and that's why I think
22:52 European bankers have chosen many many
22:54 years ago through the exploration of
22:57 Africa to say there's no way to repair
23:01 this and so they've kept them in the
23:04 dark they've kept them away from modern
23:05 technology with the intent to make them
23:08 run an algorithm of having them genocide
23:10 themselves down as much as possible and
23:13 for those that are left see if we can
23:15 rehabilitate them up to modern levels or
23:18 look at creates some Ebola virus and
23:21 wipe out the rest of them I really think
23:24 that that's what the pasty bankers have
23:27 in mind for Africa but what if they
23:32 weren't in charge and what if there were
23:36 beautiful mechanisms that we could drop
23:38 into a village a Rubik's Cube
23:41 a pyramid something very simple that
23:46 would start making the minds of those
23:48 tribe tribal people think a little bit
23:52 up they start thinking more
23:53 mathematically you find out that there
23:55 are some recessive genes that maybe are
23:57 related to the Egyptians they start to
24:02 to grow there's an African tribe
24:06 somewhere down there that they're not
24:08 exactly like your your paint your face
24:10 tribe but they have built you know faux
24:13 spaceships they want to they want to
24:16 move in they want to start exacerbating
24:19 aerospace research
24:20 they don't have any resources so they're
24:22 cannibalizing cars and they're making
24:24 like a little space shuttle it's just a
24:28 toy but the intent is there the interest
24:31 is there but no one's really helping
24:34 them because there's this other blanket
24:36 plan on top of them but again you watch
24:40 a whole series on TV or the internet
24:44 about Atlantis and when you talk about
24:47 empirical evidence of things that people
24:49 have written about Atlantis without
24:51 channeling physical evidence of its
24:55 existence there's virtually nothing and
24:59 it's amazing to me that they can
25:00 actually greenlight a show where the
25:02 producers are going what do you have on
25:06 Atlantis no no Plato talked about this
25:09 and that in this and we got a few people
25:13 that say they channel old spirits you
25:17 can make this an hour oh yeah totally
25:18 okay especially with commercials 45
25:21 minutes long okay
25:22 now what's fascinating about my personal
25:25 history with this is that I didn't
25:28 really hear about Atlantis until
25:30 probably the 80s because of my age you
25:32 know was in my mid teens in the mid 80s
25:35 now now that I've grown up and I've read
25:38 about folks that have said they've been
25:40 channeling this since the 1800s if not
25:42 before the talk about Atlantis goes back
25:45 a long way but it wasn't until the 90s
25:49 and probably with the proliferation of
25:52 the internet that I ever heard about
25:53 something called lumeria was which was
25:57 essentially the the yang to the yang
26:00 that was specific based a Pacific based
26:04 society with pretty much the same exact
26:08 story of Atlantis
26:09 it's a rinse and repeat algorithm in
26:12 terms of my my personal opinion of
26:14 someone saying gosh you know we've
26:16 really milked this Atlantis thing I mean
26:18 again unless someone starts channeling
26:20 some nice
26:22 Isaac Asimov or philip k dick or Robert
26:25 Heinlein fiction about this place we're
26:27 not going to have another series on TV
26:29 about this we've sort of blown our wad
26:31 we can maybe redo it in ten years when
26:33 the CG gets
26:36 we can go back through our evidence and
26:38 rehash it one more time but we need a
26:40 whole nother story in someone goes oh I
26:42 got it
26:43 now loom Aryan tock goes back again way
26:47 before the 90s of course but I feel like
26:50 that algorithm happened back then when
26:53 they got tired of talking about Atlantis
26:55 but what makes lost cities intriguing as
27:00 I said I think that we we yearn for the
27:03 promise that we're going to find these
27:05 cities be them underwater or underground
27:09 or in the most fanciful case like some
27:13 King Kong Island and boy it's right
27:16 there
27:16 and inside there we're gonna find the
27:19 cure to cancer we're gonna find our
27:22 balls you know by that I mean we find
27:26 our courage to fight what we already
27:28 know is wrong with our world
27:30 I think that's pathetic right we know
27:34 what's wrong with our world we know
27:35 who's making our world suck and we are
27:40 hating on the one individual who's
27:42 trying to change that at least a lot of
27:45 people are because they're so duped
27:48 aren't they I think genetically speaking
27:52 every single human being that reaches
27:54 any level of sentient awareness you
27:57 think therefore you are you can feel the
28:00 memory inside you of a time before all
28:04 of this now was it all a bowl of
28:08 cherries hell no there was always famine
28:13 there was law of the jungle but I think
28:18 that depending on who we're talking
28:22 about
28:23 and when we're talking about and where
28:25 we're talking about you might be very
28:28 very surprised to just realize for a
28:30 second
28:32 the things were balanced at one point
28:35 Graham Hancock has made some wonderful
28:38 statements about the pyramids and he he
28:43 is very angered by the notion that
28:47 someone would say that
28:48 pyramids were being by a slave culture
28:50 and I have to agree with him a thousand
28:52 percent and his main pivotal moment in
29:00 pivotal fact which I had not put
29:02 together until I heard him say this was
29:04 that he goes the Great Pyramid which is
29:06 very different than the other two
29:08 out of the three that are in the Giza
29:09 Plateau it was built with love it was
29:15 built with precision everyone
29:20 participating in the creation of the
29:21 Great Pyramid had to be constant trading
29:26 it is a work of art and you know again
29:31 for those of you who don't know you know
29:33 there's three pyramids on the pyramid on
29:35 the Giza Plateau and there's hundreds of
29:37 pyramids all over Egypt and I think that
29:39 most of them have a little bit of this
29:42 reality I'm about to illustrate to you
29:44 but the Great Pyramid the internal rocks
29:47 are on a slant
29:49 they actually slant inward to the center
29:52 of the pyramid and it's only the outer
29:54 veneer the outer rocks that actually
29:57 have this looks like it just was stacked
29:59 up this slanting of the rocks is a very
30:04 interesting decision because it makes
30:05 building the Great Pyramid far more
30:08 complicated one it vectors a lot of the
30:12 force of the rocks towards the center
30:14 which means the rocks that are in this
30:16 dead center of this pyramid are taking
30:18 on an amazing load tons and tons of
30:23 pressure from their other rocks now when
30:26 you put them level to the ground well
30:28 then the stress is just going straight
30:30 down and big giant rocks are built to
30:33 take the force above right but when you
30:37 slant them you create almost a a vector
30:40 of sort of linear torque right towards
30:43 the center it just gets exponentially
30:47 more intense towards the centre which is
30:49 why some of the rocks have started to
30:51 crack because of the pressure is so
30:53 great but as Graham Hancock noted he
30:56 said look what you have to understand is
30:59 this is a massive
31:00 massive structure and it's funny I have
31:04 a book on the pyramids that misquotes
31:07 the height of the pyramids according to
31:09 Graham Hancock the height of the Great
31:10 Pyramid is 480 feet the book I read said
31:13 453 feet or something like that so I'm
31:16 gonna go with Graham's estimations
31:19 because he's been there several times so
31:21 over 480 feet tall that's huge right two
31:25 and a half million rocks roughly it's an
31:28 estimate for two and a half two point
31:29 three to two point five million rocks he
31:32 said look if you made a mistake at the
31:34 bottom of one of these pyramids then the
31:36 top isn't gonna come out at all
31:37 it's gonna go wrong and it's gonna go
31:39 wrong really fast but they're as perfect
31:43 as could be made and they're lying to do
31:50 north they have PI built into their
31:55 measurements you can derive the
31:59 circumference and the diameter of the
32:01 earth from the measurements of the Great
32:02 Pyramid that's important so what society
32:08 could get along long enough to create
32:10 not only one of these things but
32:13 literally hundreds of these things all
32:15 over the area of Egypt bent pyramids
32:20 which were classified as mistakes that
32:25 they have the angle wrong and that they
32:26 simply corrected it after they went up a
32:28 certain distance realize they weren't
32:30 going to have a nice pyramid at the top
32:32 and so they changed their pyramid shape
32:34 that's a complete lie because there's
32:38 dozens and dozens of bent pyramids there
32:42 are massive pyramids that are so big
32:44 they're mistaken for mountains small
32:47 mountains but mountains nonetheless made
32:49 by man this isn't a slave culture this
32:54 is a culture that got along and I'm
32:57 gonna suggest thousands of people over
33:00 thousands of years got along and I think
33:04 that this might be the rudimentary
33:07 archetype of our past that drives us to
33:13 want to look back in the
33:14 place to find where we went wrong the
33:17 whole you know the adage of you know to
33:23 not know history is to repeat it imagine
33:27 a child looking into a phone every
33:28 thirty seconds because they're taught
33:31 this is how you get your little fix your
33:33 little dopamine drop boom boom boom how
33:38 could they possibly hang on to a thought
33:40 that has any length to it any dimension
33:43 to it
33:44 they can't understand history if you
33:47 told them to told it to them because the
33:49 cavities in their brain their neural net
33:52 is a bunch of shallow connections and
33:55 the amount of memory and death necessary
33:59 to hold a deep thought it just as
34:02 genetically not possible so the reason
34:05 why I go down this route is to say that
34:07 those who are claiming to channel may
34:11 simply be dealing with their own
34:13 psychosis of need to dig up this history
34:19 just say I feel it and I'm gonna make
34:22 this up and maybe they're not completely
34:25 making it up they might be making up
34:27 specific names specific instances but
34:29 perhaps they are tuning themselves to
34:32 our past and simply saying I am going to
34:35 channel the overall feeling that we used
34:38 to have and I will put a little fiction
34:40 on top of this but what I'm really
34:42 trying to do and I support some of this
34:46 is to reignite in mankind that there was
34:49 a time when we were advanced and we were
34:53 good yeah there's a little coveting
34:55 going on a little bit of hiding their
34:57 location because you know they can get
35:00 overrun and then bad things happen and
35:03 then the people that want to believe the
35:06 channelers are often frowned upon by
35:08 those of us who don't believe these
35:09 locations may or may not have existed
35:11 specifically but all they're trying to
35:14 do is get back to their past - they feel
35:16 it in their chest you know I talked
35:19 about on the show the fact that you know
35:23 the religions of the world that have a
35:25 virgin birth
35:27 they have a messiah that comes down and
35:29 lives a little while and then has died
35:31 the Dyson is resurrected you know it's
35:34 the son that is born okay think about
35:37 the Sun in the sky too it provides light
35:40 and information and health and we
35:43 understand where we are it dies which is
35:48 nighttime we go into panic because we
35:51 don't have the information of light
35:52 anymore unless it's a full moon all the
35:56 Predators of the world your leopards and
35:59 what have you that can see beautifully
36:01 at night terror our families apart and
36:06 it's only when the Sun is reborn again
36:08 resurrected in the morning do we get
36:11 back this information in this light and
36:13 it's glorious and imagine your caveman
36:16 you don't understand heliocentric models
36:19 of the universe or whatever you think
36:21 this place is doesn't matter really so
36:25 the birth death and resurrection is
36:26 simply the Sun going up and down and
36:29 providing information for us to grow us
36:32 to protect ourselves that is the base
36:36 format of the human condition that then
36:39 when retold through a mythos seems real
36:43 well of course there's just something
36:46 absolutely truthful about this whole
36:48 story and you're gonna call the Sun
36:52 Jesus or you can call him Tomas you can
36:57 call him kou :
37:00 but there are I believe 23 virgin birth
37:05 messiahs there's a reason the story
37:08 keeps getting told now when we start
37:12 finding the cities that we do find lost
37:15 cities that are real and Graham Hancock
37:17 has done a tremendous effort on these
37:20 lost cities the pyramids of china right
37:23 the Aztec / sorry I say it should say
37:25 the Inca pyramids down south and South
37:28 America you got pyramids down there the
37:30 size of true mountains and we haven't
37:34 begun to acknowledge that they exist in
37:36 the public light it's so strange if you
37:40 really wanted to know
37:41 we have been we'd have to excavate you
37:43 know millions of metric tons of topsoil
37:46 to reveal these amazing creations Machu
37:51 Picchu and even though Stonehenge was
37:54 reconstructed in 1954 completely moved
37:57 from where they found the stones to
37:59 where they actually placed them so when
38:01 you go there you're looking at a
38:02 facsimile of what was there
38:04 the stones were carved by someone a long
38:07 time ago and put in a little circle now
38:10 whether or not they're druid based or
38:11 whatever is all probably complete crap
38:14 maybe it's true maybe it's not but that
38:16 you served it there you go
38:19 there are temples all over Africa Turkey
38:26 how many people were completely blown
38:29 away when they saw Indiana Jones part 3
38:32 when he goes into that little Cove and
38:35 finds that beautiful building this was
38:38 was carved out of the mountainside if
38:43 you look at the real evidence of that
38:44 area they have carved there's a bunch of
38:47 those in that same area there's
38:49 literally like I don't even know how
38:51 many I saw at least six where they had
38:53 been carving that face over and over and
38:56 over again until they got it right and
38:58 the one that they use in the movie is
39:00 the most correct one but if you pay
39:02 attention to it it has some proportional
39:04 issues it's still a little distorted
39:06 right but it's still a magnificent
39:09 creation for men someone went and saw I
39:11 guess Rome he came back and said well
39:14 you know we can probably find you know
39:16 we dig out this sandstone it's really
39:18 pliable just as long as we don't dig out
39:21 because you can't put it back you gotta
39:22 be real careful then they figured out a
39:25 way to carve sort of a Roman Greek
39:30 Egyptian column-based facade into a
39:35 mountain I don't even know if you call
39:38 that a mountain a crevasse built of I
39:41 guess some some fairly strong but
39:44 pliable stone but in this episode I want
39:47 you to focus on your own internal
39:49 yearnings for this information
39:54 I think a first pass of this sort of
39:58 feeling from some sort of new take from
40:03 perhaps a philosopher a psychologist
40:07 they may blow the whole thing off but
40:09 simple but but also acknowledge the arc
40:11 of saying you just want things to be
40:13 better in your life you want things to
40:15 be simple in your life and so you're
40:18 willing to go to Disneyland and say I
40:20 want this to be real
40:21 I want to live in Disneyland or you play
40:23 a video game how many times have some of
40:26 you guys played video games and you
40:29 definitely have the thought I'd like to
40:31 live here for at least a little while
40:32 I'd like to try this reality out a world
40:36 of warcraft world we can kind of play
40:40 around and there's a little bit of
40:42 comedy in there it's not some crazy
40:43 starcraft bloodbath or some Diablo you
40:48 know visitation to Satan but you get to
40:50 be the hero right how many of us watch
40:53 movies you're like gosh it'd be nice to
40:56 be in that world it's such a fundamental
41:00 thing that you know there's a game
41:02 called fallout which is a
41:04 post-apocalyptic you know nuclear era
41:08 blue you know they detonated all the
41:10 bombs they had the war and it's over and
41:13 it's in this apocalyptic world where you
41:16 have Raiders and scavengers that will
41:19 kill you to take your stuff but when you
41:23 play it if you're a guy I will say this
41:25 much I don't think a lot of women play
41:27 this game there's a point where you may
41:29 say and I've had this feeling myself at
41:31 least there's no taxes at least there's
41:34 no bankers at least there's no
41:36 politicians lying to me constantly least
41:38 there's no television trying to sell me
41:40 something I don't need yeah that's a
41:42 rough world but some of us dudes are
41:44 like yeah just give me a pair of jeans
41:47 leather jacket and some boots and a gun
41:50 maybe my dog and we'll roll the dice
41:53 right the reality is we shouldn't be
41:57 having those feelings I mean honestly we
41:59 shouldn't want to roll the dice into a
42:01 post-apocalyptic radioactive world but
42:05 we do sometimes
42:07 we shouldn't want to leave our
42:09 particular reality we should want to
42:11 make it better my writing teacher says
42:14 that you know fictional things must
42:19 exist for man for one very specific
42:22 reason that life isn't enough the living
42:29 this life has been so distorted by
42:33 marketing departments by repression and
42:37 oppression that we need fictional
42:41 stories to create some escape so that we
42:45 can be happy and I don't think he he's
42:49 talking about this from the perspective
42:50 that this is the way it should be I
42:52 think he's just simply noting ever since
42:57 governments grew so did the plays and
43:02 the poems and the stories the songs if
43:06 you go back to Greece you know you have
43:09 to study the idea that the playwrights
43:12 back in those days were often murdered
43:14 the actors were murdered and why were
43:18 they murdered they would put on a play
43:22 making fun of the government exposing
43:26 the government corruption and then the
43:28 people from time to time way back in pre
43:31 Greece would rise up and change the
43:33 government and eventually the government
43:36 said we're gonna hire some mercenaries
43:38 to kill these people to get rid of the
43:42 resistance that we hate so much and this
43:46 went on for a long time and then when
43:49 Greece lost control to Rome Rome under
43:53 the auspices of the flavia's family the
43:57 titus flavius caesar created something
44:01 called the colosseum and what they were
44:05 able to do is create a similar form of
44:08 entertainment with no intellectual
44:11 capacity required a sport push someone
44:16 in the middle have them eaten by a tiger
44:19 push a weak man and a strong man in
44:21 there a gladiator and a citizen who is
44:24 being punished for whatever reason maybe
44:26 they were a thief
44:27 maybe they simply raised their voice
44:29 against the state and the gladiator
44:31 beats them down until they're dead and
44:35 according to history which may or may
44:37 not be true the audience roared and this
44:42 is what we have today it's called sports
44:45 you're not focusing on any issues you
44:48 absolutely positively do not need an
44:50 intellectual bone in your body
44:52 maybe baseball maybe cricket to sit and
44:57 watch a game for 36 hours right but most
45:01 most sports don't require you to have a
45:05 bone in your body of any an intellectual
45:07 capacity whatsoever which is why a lot
45:09 of times when you find a person who
45:11 could quote you stats after stats of
45:13 their favorite sport but they're
45:16 probably in my opinion they are some of
45:20 the easiest sort of human fodder for the
45:24 Canon of demise that we have on this
45:28 planet they don't have any deep thoughts
45:30 they don't they see NFL people kneeling
45:36 who when you interview them why your why
45:39 are you kneeling their answer changes
45:41 drastically day to day not realizing
45:45 that they're millionaires a lot of them
45:47 hundred millionaires they could take
45:49 their money and go do a public service
45:51 announcement if they have something to
45:52 protest but that's beyond their
45:55 intellectual capacity so what did the
45:59 law cities offer us today let's say that
46:02 they existed but say that Atlantis
46:05 existed well even the fabled
46:11 recollections of its existence
46:13 make it a fairly small location which
46:17 means the population would be small the
46:20 amount of real estate to live and
46:22 manufacture inventions would be very
46:25 small we have never found evidence of
46:28 flying vehicles that were made by human
46:31 beings
46:32 we go back very far at all the Egyptians
46:36 are well known for having things that
46:40 are discovered right a boat is
46:42 discovered in a quarry that was being
46:44 built and it has a an amazing design but
46:47 it's still a seafaring boat they can't
46:50 do a lot of deep-sea and I don't mean
46:53 down under the water but way out in the
46:55 middle of middle of the Atlantic sort of
46:57 travel it's still a coastal boat by most
47:01 estimations and that's estimated based
47:03 on its propulsion system or lack thereof
47:05 and it's also estimated on how many
47:07 people it takes to operate the boat and
47:10 how much spare space is in the hull to
47:12 supply them with food we had to surmount
47:17 all of these issues come up with the
47:19 better sails structure and to be able to
47:24 move across the ocean with a very light
47:26 sail a very light wind power versus
47:29 massive wind power and if you've ever
47:32 taken up sailing it's a it's an art in
47:34 the smallest boat we had all the scurvy
47:38 and the weird you know tooth decay and
47:42 gum dispute fruits the limes right the
47:47 limey bastards remember that whole thing
47:50 to preserve health over what was you
47:55 know probably a month long journey in
47:57 these older boats right we think about
48:01 flying ships from time to time and I
48:05 think it's fairly safe to say we
48:07 wouldn't have made a flying boat out of
48:09 limestone rock or out of any of the
48:12 rocks that were used to make Machu
48:13 Picchu so even though we're seeing
48:16 brilliant craftsmanship and I mean
48:19 off-the-chain craftsmanship that seems
48:21 to take into account earthquakes and
48:23 stability and all these things we don't
48:27 have any evidence that the the Mayans
48:30 for instance who seemed to create this
48:32 beautiful artwork of individuals taking
48:34 off in these ships you know looks like a
48:36 little astronauts guy we don't have you
48:39 know a query or a location where we
48:42 start to see complex metals it's very
48:45 lightweight metal
48:46 that could they could hold a crew and
48:49 provide a life support system and get
48:51 off the ground we don't see anything we
48:55 have found the little clock you know
48:57 that's the sort of beautiful timepiece
48:59 that was discovered in the Mediterranean
49:01 Sea that dates back to again like 0 AD
49:05 or before it seems to have provided a
49:08 tremendous advancement on sailing the
49:11 world it seems like this timepiece is
49:13 capable of measuring longitude and
49:15 latitude something that wasn't completed
49:17 until the mid 1800s in modern
49:22 quote-unquote history now some of you
49:26 will probably have studied the idea of a
49:28 great reset where we did have all of
49:32 this and simply it all rotted into the
49:34 ground now in my various research
49:38 projects for screenplays that I've
49:40 written I did talk to individuals about
49:43 what would last the longest on earth
49:45 what could you possibly create that
49:47 would last through an ice age let's just
49:50 say we believe that and they said rocks
49:54 rocks is really the only thing you could
49:56 possibly carve up that could possibly
49:59 survive any multiple thousands of years
50:02 going by multiple millennia going by the
50:06 ice age is very interesting because I
50:08 don't believe that they actually happen
50:10 for one it's one of these out-of-sight
50:12 out-of-mind theories when I started to
50:16 study why they believe that ice ages
50:19 occurred is kind of a two-fold system we
50:25 study glaciers today and glaciers grow
50:29 and glaciers shrink we can go
50:31 multiple places in the world and watch
50:33 glaciers move and they are unbelievably
50:37 massive and they move and they churn the
50:42 earth underneath and they are you're
50:45 talking about you know a couple miles
50:47 deep of ice that weighs unfathomable or
50:53 infallible amounts of tons and they are
50:57 crushing whatever's down there
50:59 soft metals man it's gonna be a demise
51:02 down below so if you thought you had New
51:04 York City all pinned down such that
51:06 historians could never lose sight of it
51:09 if a glacier were to create itself over
51:12 New York and roll over it like we see in
51:14 the North Pole earth or the South Pole
51:17 it's gone it's crushed out of existence
51:22 now that may not be an absolute there
51:24 may be a girder that makes it through it
51:26 rolls it gets locked in a ravine and
51:29 whatever reason doesn't get pulverized
51:31 the other big claim of ice ages is that
51:37 rocks big giant rocks are tumbled and we
51:40 the geologists of the world believe that
51:42 they have proven that these tumbled
51:45 rocks are all over the world's surface
51:48 and therefore the whole world is pretty
51:51 much covered in ice in some cyclical
51:53 basis of depending on who you ask
51:57 every twenty five thousand years or so
51:59 this this natural cycle occurs the idea
52:04 that the earth somehow gets itself out
52:06 of whack with the Sun to the degree that
52:10 we have these extreme freezing and
52:13 thawing processes doesn't make any sense
52:15 to me whatsoever what would make let's
52:18 just go with the heliocentric thing for
52:19 a while what on earth would make us
52:23 loose this relationship with the big
52:25 ball of fire in the sky when we are
52:28 always in a descending orbit around our
52:30 Sun meaning it gets closer to the Sun
52:32 and any whatever infinitesimal amount it
52:35 is it gets closer to the Sun so we
52:37 should never be getting cold to the
52:39 extent that the oceans freeze up there's
52:43 the other miscalculation which is to say
52:45 that we have enough ocean to do this
52:47 it's all gonna suck up on top of the
52:50 continents and start crushing the
52:52 continents I don't buy it but when
52:55 you're told this what does it do to your
52:56 mind it simply says that well whatever
53:00 we have on this side of the last ice age
53:02 is all that could exist because an ice
53:04 age erases absolute now they don't
53:08 really claim that the Equator
53:10 get this sort of pulverizing
53:13 experience to my knowledge correct me if
53:16 you know different with the claims that
53:20 might explain if you do believe in these
53:21 things and let's just say they did exist
53:23 why the Giza Plateau
53:25 in last tens of thousands of years way
53:29 past any claimed Ice Age cycle because
53:32 they are never touched by the glaciers
53:33 in the first place but what I think is
53:36 interesting is and I found this research
53:38 and a different path was that these
53:42 rolling rocks actually could have come
53:46 out of the absolute bowels of the earth
53:48 but it's a very natural process of you
53:53 know magma forming and rolling into
53:56 existence it doesn't have to be the
54:00 byproduct of ice they tell you that the
54:04 Grand Canyon is made from ice when if
54:08 you just use expanding earth algorithm
54:10 you can put it all back together if you
54:13 look at any and I forgot to mention this
54:14 in the expanding earth depe so but if
54:15 you look at most rivers in the entire
54:18 world one side matches the other side it
54:21 looks like a tear in the earth a tear
54:25 due to an expanding Center that is
54:27 simply fracturing it it's as if you took
54:30 a balloon and you blew it up one quarter
54:32 and you painted it the very light
54:36 coating of paint and then you continued
54:38 blowing it up after it dried and you
54:41 blew it up four times the amount it's
54:44 true
54:44 full-size well right off the bat you can
54:48 do your math and say it's going to have
54:50 most likely three-fourths empty space
54:53 without paint and that is your ocean
54:57 base now some cities most of the lost
55:01 cities that we have discovered and lost
55:02 only means that we didn't know that they
55:04 were there and we found them we usually
55:08 classify them as interesting because
55:10 they tend to have some architectural or
55:13 or fabrication reality that blows our
55:17 mind again Machu Picchu amazing the
55:21 pyramids in Egypt amazing the pyramids
55:24 in China amazing the lost city off the
55:26 coast
55:27 of Japan that Graham Hancock and his
55:30 wife filmed these big giant slabs of
55:34 rocks that must have supported some some
55:38 sort of civilization but definitely
55:40 man-made and they have steps that have
55:43 been carved as if at one point the ocean
55:47 was much shallower and these steps were
55:50 revealed and they were built by people
55:53 trying to create a society what's
55:55 interesting about it is to my knowledge
55:57 there aren't land-based cities in Japan
56:01 that matched the ones that are off the
56:02 coast so it was like there was this
56:04 giant shift in architectural theory
56:07 perhaps the rocks don't exist inside the
56:10 land and that's why they don't do it I
56:12 think that's pretty fascinating why did
56:14 the Chinese build pyramids and then
56:16 never build pyramids again it's as if
56:20 whatever civilization did that moved on
56:22 but they buried a bunch of soldiers
56:25 sculpted soldiers and the base of one of
56:27 the pyramids very strange that the
56:30 pyramids get built first and then
56:32 someone found it and decided hey let's
56:35 put these soldiers underneath
56:37 was it a crude way to simply put a bunch
56:40 of rocks on something to protect it you
56:44 can't put anything underneath the
56:46 pyramids of giza because there's a giant
56:48 plateau underneath made of limestone so
56:52 what do we do with these little
56:55 fragments of information about our
57:00 ancient history well luckily the
57:04 majority of the stories are real they
57:07 really are places that we've gone for
57:10 Atlantis and Lemuria well keep searching
57:14 I'm willing to bet with the amount of
57:17 radar information that we have and radar
57:19 map information or I should say even
57:21 satellite images or high altitude images
57:24 I have a family member that works in
57:26 altitude mapping technology she manages
57:30 the imagery from independent companies
57:34 to create maps for government rescue
57:39 missions so like
57:40 Katrina's doing its thing she works with
57:45 these independent companies to find the
57:47 data and connect the maps together so
57:49 they can respond to it when flights
57:51 disappear they can be used to search for
57:55 flights that disappear in all kinds of
57:57 stuff so it you know for those of you
57:59 who question the existence of satellites
58:01 there are companies that provide this
58:03 service and I I find it very hard to
58:05 believe that they are using
58:06 high-altitude planes to capture all of
58:08 these images so whatever you think
58:10 satellites are there's something up
58:12 there and they take pictures and it's a
58:15 big business and there's multiple
58:16 companies that do it so the idea that
58:19 Atlantis is out there for you to
58:22 discover I think most people have
58:26 conceded that if it does exist it would
58:28 be sort of a blemish on the bottom of
58:30 the ocean hidden in plain sight eroded
58:35 by time and therefore has limited value
58:40 to us I think that we need to
58:44 acknowledge in us that if you're sitting
58:49 around waiting for a rescue that's
58:52 probably not the attitude you want
58:54 because it's probably not coming and
58:57 it's very similar to the story that I've
59:00 said a couple times on various shows
59:02 which is we have experimented
59:06 millionaires have experimented
59:08 sociological experiments where they took
59:10 people from Africa from tribes and
59:14 brought them to New York and put them in
59:16 Suites and let them live and try to
59:20 integrate them into modern society
59:22 claiming that there is no real gap it's
59:26 sort of that Trading Places storyline
59:28 where you can take anyone from the
59:31 ghetto and move them into this
59:32 aristocracy and someone from the
59:34 aristocracy in the ghetto and they will
59:36 simply trade behaviors now within that
59:39 particular example I actually think that
59:41 might actually work to a degree but as I
59:44 had to describe to me they go back to
59:47 the suite and these individuals because
59:50 they have not been trained all right
59:52 they turned it into a jungle
59:54 they didn't know how to use a blender a
59:57 TV a sofa a bed these aren't things that
60:02 they natively have where they came from
60:04 and so even though they were given the
60:07 promise as we may have imposed on them
60:09 even though they live probably a very
60:11 fine life where they are we weren't
60:15 ready so let's say you find Atlantis and
60:20 it's in pristine condition it's inside a
60:22 mountain or something or you find the
60:25 byproduct of their inventions and some
60:27 of the location in the world that isn't
60:28 where Atlantis was if it is truly all
60:33 the answers that you're looking for
60:35 what's that going to do to your taxes
60:38 what's that going to do to your
60:39 repression and your oppression is it
60:42 gonna make GMO foods go away fluoride go
60:45 away aspartame go away nope is he gonna
60:49 take the cell phones out of the hands of
60:51 your child no it's not gonna do any of
60:55 that you're gonna have to own your own
60:58 mind and your own paradigm of change you
61:01 have to the man doesn't want to hear
61:05 that we want a promise and that's the
61:08 fascination with I believe of the lost
61:11 cities some folks just want to get off
61:15 on how smart was man before today and I
61:21 will tell you that I think I know how
61:23 smart we were and it has nothing to do
61:27 with spaceships technology of any kind I
61:32 think that those exist I think that the
61:35 Egyptians potentially were healing
61:36 themselves with frequencies of energy
61:38 but I don't think they probably got that
61:41 sick they didn't eat things that were
61:44 against the human body like pure sugars
61:46 they didn't OD on things they weren't
61:49 obese for any of you who are absolutely
61:54 religious about brushing your teeth
61:56 every day and I should I suggest you
61:57 continue in this culture for sure you
62:02 have Pharaohs living to be in their 90's
62:05 that died with all of their teeth in
62:07 there
62:08 we find their skulls man and we find a
62:10 you know tens of thousands of skulls of
62:15 of Romans and Greeks that were actually
62:17 buried in the Egyptian tombs all with
62:22 their teeth because they didn't have a
62:25 candy bars that we have in the ice cream
62:28 that we have today I think you feel me
62:32 the promise that we're looking for is
62:34 something we're going to actually have
62:36 to work for it's in our brains and it's
62:42 carried through the medium of
62:44 indoctrination and propaganda through
62:46 television through the internet through
62:49 film through little memes that we tell
62:54 each other again when we say things like
62:57 well everyone dies of cancer everything
62:59 causes cancer it's simply not true it's
63:03 a man-made defect it's a man-made
63:07 disease and it didn't exist like it
63:11 exists today and I'm willing to I'm
63:13 willing to bet 200 years ago the kind of
63:16 cancer you got was because the the
63:20 individuals that were getting it were
63:21 perhaps doing something that wasn't
63:24 natural burning coal and breathing it
63:27 playing around with uranium bricks
63:30 because it's a neat heavy rock that's
63:33 warm changing the food supply from its
63:36 native food supply of whatever food
63:39 groups are supposed to be eating and
63:40 neglecting some certain nutritional
63:42 supplement and dying of it there was a
63:46 reason why sailors were so mystified
63:48 while their teeth were falling out while
63:52 their legs got bowed the more they spend
63:55 time on the sea thinking that they could
63:57 not eat what they were eating on land
64:00 its food I hate food I was hungry I
64:03 supplanted the hunger and my stomach was
64:06 something why am I suddenly sick not
64:09 realizing that there's a nutritional
64:10 regiment that they must engage in to
64:13 stay healthy while things were good we
64:17 trusted our leaders and our leaders
64:19 stabbed us in the back
64:21 not that many again it's just a few at
64:25 the top if you the control the
64:27 mechanisms by which we value money
64:29 currency of any kind and I'll just close
64:33 with this statement which for the
64:35 listeners the the common listeners of
64:36 the show this is me preaching to you and
64:39 you already know this for those of you
64:42 are new welcome to the club
64:44 and for all of you this is something
64:47 that I think you need to embed in your
64:48 own life and pass on to others any
64:52 faction on earth that lobbies to get rid
64:58 of the checks and balances which is an
65:00 average population working together to
65:03 create a balanced society to create
65:06 representation of each individual group
65:09 go see my episode on politics which
65:11 isn't as much about politics as a
65:13 simulation of a bunch of people on an
65:15 island building a society that's what
65:18 the episode is really about any group
65:21 that's trying to centralize power under
65:23 a group of human beings on earth any
65:26 group that's doing that is a group that
65:30 is creating this super divide between
65:32 what used to be balanced and wonderful
65:34 and happy in this world that makes you
65:37 look for the promises of UFOs and aliens
65:39 landing to solve all of our problems a
65:41 lost city that is full of all the
65:43 technology that will undo all of the
65:45 problems that we have today what if the
65:49 only thing you ever found in a lost city
65:50 was a tome that told a story about how
65:55 there was no debt about how there was no
65:57 money it's a gene roddenberry story of
66:00 how to live in a balanced world there
66:03 was equality for everyone there were no
66:06 birth defects races well who cares what
66:08 color you are can you lift that rock
66:11 well that rock needs to be lifted lift
66:13 it I don't care for your female or a
66:14 male I don't care if you're gay or
66:16 straight it doesn't matter that rock
66:18 needs to be lifted I'm lifting a rock
66:20 over here this dude over here or this
66:22 girl over here is carving the rock up so
66:25 that we can use it for a very specific
66:26 purpose but if the tone merely said were
66:30 being nice to each other that's how
66:33 everything is so perfect
66:34 that's why Atlantis was famous that's
66:36 why lumeria was famous yeah you know we
66:39 had some hot-air balloons and moved
66:41 around well guess what we already have
66:43 that technology we don't need to find
66:45 another way to travel on earth we can
66:47 get anywhere on this planet to another
66:50 place on this planet by buying vehicles
66:52 and tickets to do so we don't need that
66:54 information and you know for those of
66:57 you who want to explore space that is
66:59 another frontier of promise ah we can go
67:02 to another planet we can go offworld and
67:05 get away from these governments in this
67:07 taxation just like the settlers who came
67:09 in from Europe who conquered the United
67:11 States of America they loved Dodge City
67:14 and Deadwood and tombstone because there
67:17 was no law that could do whatever they
67:18 wanted there's pluses and minuses in all
67:21 categories as I've said several times on
67:25 this show now that we're aware a lot of
67:28 assert ware and the snowballs getting
67:30 bigger the overall consciousness of
67:33 corruption is starting to spread at a
67:36 rapid pace there's really no excuse for
67:40 us not to 1 spread this information to
67:43 others and to to make the changes in our
67:45 own personal lives for ourselves and for
67:47 our families to correct all of this
67:51 chaos it's happening on our watch for
67:57 any of you who revel in revolutions that
68:00 changed your world
68:02 the Americans well we had a 27 year war
68:05 called the revolution where we fought
68:07 off the European monarchy so that we
68:10 could have this idea that we call
68:12 America of true freedom
68:14 no fascism no socialism be a common law
68:20 do no harm that's it it was all based on
68:24 something happened in Europe called
68:25 Magna Carta which the second it was
68:28 passed go see my episode on Magna Carta
68:30 the king or the follow up King started
68:33 taxing the people the people said we
68:36 don't like these taxes and he said well
68:37 if you loosen up your rights inside
68:39 Magna Carta I'll reduce the taxes he
68:41 manipulated them right back into the
68:43 serfdom that they had just escaped but
68:46 because they had nearly a
68:48 and years of the Inquisition pounding a
68:51 fake religion into their mind they were
68:54 very very capable of being molded one
68:56 more time just takes one generation to
68:59 lose all the progress of hundreds of
69:02 generations before them but how is that
69:06 done it's done through choking education
69:10 choking the algorithms of history in
69:14 this world we are forced to learn about
69:16 the Holocaust and why are we forced to
69:19 learn about the Holocaust there's a lot
69:21 of reasons why were forced learn about
69:22 the Holocaust but the overall general
69:24 accepted arc is so that it never happens
69:26 again
69:27 well there are many things that we are
69:29 allowing to happen right now that are
69:31 far worse than any Holocaust you have
69:33 ever heard about in your life in any
69:35 history and I would say compound
69:37 interest user in credit card debt is
69:40 probably a million times worse than any
69:43 Holocaust you could possibly conceive of
69:46 because it removes all happiness from
69:50 the world it rides on you like a demon
69:53 on your back it destroys the quality of
69:57 all life you've been taught that someone
70:00 should be able to make money off helping
70:03 you make a profit off helping you we
70:07 need to build humans that just want to
70:09 help each other we need to help those
70:12 who don't want to work because they've
70:13 just been beaten down they've had a
70:14 horrible hand dealt to them and you
70:18 figure out a way to reinvigorate their
70:20 purpose to live which is their love I
70:23 think you feel me for those of you who
70:29 haven't gone too deep thoughts radio
70:30 calm you should probably go there's
70:32 audio and video there's a lakh Facebook
70:34 group link and there's a patreon
70:37 connection there I've been pushing
70:41 patreon more often now because it would
70:43 be cool to do this full-time wouldn't it
70:45 we take a lot of you I'm starting to put
70:50 up a lot of exclusive content on there I
70:54 shouldn't say a lot just yet by the time
70:56 you see this it might be true I'm going
70:59 to start releasing these videos on
71:01 patreon
71:02 before I release them on YouTube or any
71:04 other format and for those of you who
71:06 have been so kind to donate on that
71:09 particular platform you need to make
71:11 sure you click the notification Bell
71:13 mechanism on that site because I'll post
71:16 and none of you get updated as to the
71:19 the new post I just realized I get I got
71:22 a notification that no one's being
71:24 notified so you guys aren't realising
71:26 the exclusive contents up there anyhow
71:29 if you made it to the end thank you so
71:31 much take care of yourself and someone
71:35 else and I'll see you in the next deep
71:36 thoughts over now
