00:00 [Music]
00:31 good morning good evening and welcome
00:34 back to deep thoughts radio season four
00:38 in the last ten episodes so I'm not
00:43 exactly sure what the helmet to call
00:44 this episode because I have some things
00:46 that I've written down that I think I
00:48 need to address I want to address and
00:53 hopefully be helpful for a lot of people
00:55 out there kind of struggling this
00:57 episode may like so many others be more
01:02 sort of a historical archive of what the
01:05 issues were in 2019 in the beginning of
01:07 summer even though it doesn't feel like
01:10 summer today one of my notes for a title
01:14 was called arresting the truth kind of
01:20 like that maybe that's what we end up
01:21 calling is but I want to talk about the
01:24 17 movement as well because it's kind of
01:27 slowed down a little bit although the
01:31 end product is pretty accurate as to
01:34 what was rumored to have been coming
01:38 what has occurred obviously a giant
01:40 portion of the grand plan hasn't
01:45 occurred and so what what's happened is
01:50 it's divided society into three specific
01:53 categories that I personally can tell
01:55 and I think it's fascinating and I think
01:59 I want to kick off at this one because
02:00 it's so fresh in my brain so for those
02:03 of you don't know what I'm talking about
02:04 I'm using code because the deep state
02:08 which owns this video platform with YT
02:12 as its initials because we're gonna be
02:15 on other platforms here within the year
02:18 so that won't completely apply they're
02:22 part of the deep state 100% they censor
02:25 out of a loyalty to loyalty and bankers
02:29 they simply do it's the truth you want
02:32 to know who these people are just look
02:34 at the CEOs and you know we're talking
02:39 about peep
02:40 who sold their [ __ ] soul a long time
02:43 ago or as quickly as I possibly could if
02:47 there's a bad place that one goes after
02:49 death these people will get an extra
02:50 [ __ ] dose of it but nothing else they
02:54 get to look in the mirror and realize
02:55 they're a piece of [ __ ] for the rest of
02:56 their lives and that's just the truth so
03:00 that's why we have to talk in code so
03:01 look up the seventeenth letter in the
03:03 alphabet and if you need to understand
03:06 more about it put that letter in the
03:08 search engine and put the word movement
03:10 after it and hit the old search button
03:12 and whatever comes back is what I'm
03:16 talking about here in this first phase
03:17 but I'm always talking about the
03:19 generational gaps on this show because
03:22 that's how my whole life works when I
03:24 made videogames it was always about what
03:26 generation are we making gains for when
03:28 I was really young it was easier to say
03:30 this game is from my generation but even
03:32 when we hit our 20s we had to dream up
03:35 games for 12 year olds the 16 year olds
03:37 which was a generation at least a decade
03:39 behind us right then when I got into
03:41 filmmaking the idea is that you have to
03:43 write for these generations and write
03:45 for the cultural conditions that we're
03:49 in and so when I think about the 17
03:51 movement and how it's either rejected or
03:53 adopted it's interesting and I have a
03:56 good friend of mine who's very brilliant
03:58 who is going to make up the last group
04:00 and I'm very glad this person is is
04:03 concerned and taking the position that
04:06 they're taking because it helps me see
04:10 this but what are the three I think
04:14 there's three main groups that observe
04:16 the 17 movement the first group is your
04:21 younger millennial / Jin's II who are
04:25 leading the March they are the literally
04:26 leading physical marches in the outside
04:28 world for the 17 movement and all of its
04:30 agendas regardless if they carry that
04:32 letter on their yellow vest and then you
04:37 have the next one which I think is the
04:40 baby boomer generation we're going to
04:42 jump over this middle area but you have
04:44 a baby boomer generation that is
04:48 completely rejecting it because they
04:50 grew up with Lee Harvey Oswald shot
04:52 Kennedy and we're
04:53 on the moon and every [ __ ] conspiracy
04:55 is untrue and that's just the way it is
05:00 you could show them proof of something
05:02 and they would reject it because again
05:04 it's just a defense mechanism and and
05:09 you know sort of it's like you have to
05:11 feel sorry for them if they're in that
05:12 role because there's plenty of baby
05:13 boomers that are leading the charge as
05:15 well
05:15 so you know we're privileged to have a
05:18 few that watched this show religiously
05:21 but they just the ones that are still in
05:23 denial are the ones that are gonna die
05:25 in denial because their life was was
05:27 nice it was good they didn't have to you
05:32 know they could live around the
05:34 conspiracies where I didn't interfere
05:35 with their life I mean it actually did
05:37 but they for whatever reason never
05:41 acknowledged that anything should be any
05:43 different the suffering that they
05:45 incurred if any was something that they
05:48 felt like was either random nature or
05:50 they deserved it or some other weird
05:52 irrational processing mechanism instead
05:55 of saying wait a minute
05:56 I was just harmed who did that because
06:00 we have a law of this land and somebody
06:02 broke it I'm gonna go change it and I'm
06:05 not coming back until I do change it
06:07 because whoever just harmed us is gonna
06:09 get harmed gotta get corrected no no
06:14 that happens so they passed down all of
06:16 that pain to the kids in my generation
06:18 which is Gen X and so in my generation I
06:25 think you have people sitting on the
06:27 fence and probably just the first you
06:32 know a few years into baby boomer
06:34 probably the last few years of the Gen X
06:36 are really more acting like Millennials
06:37 who knows but there's a you know there's
06:39 decades in there but we have this group
06:41 of folks sort of in-between and they are
06:45 afraid to totally dedicate themselves to
06:47 seventeen and I totally get it but
06:51 what's interesting is is I keep getting
06:54 this algorithm back from one of my
06:56 friends and it's it's cute as can be
06:58 I'm starting to suspect this is how I
07:01 get it quoted to me I'm starting to
07:03 suspect that the 17 person isn't real
07:05 that it's
07:07 and here's a friend of mine who I think
07:09 is really smart who also doesn't believe
07:11 17 is real sort of like taking your
07:13 opinion and adding validation to it and
07:15 there's been like I don't know three or
07:18 four people that this person keeps
07:20 referring me to like different people in
07:22 this effort to make sure I change my
07:25 belief system to their belief system you
07:28 have to know that's extremely difficult
07:30 extremely difficult where I have a
07:34 gigantic scaffolding that the size of
07:36 the Tower of Babel someone comes in and
07:38 with a little tiny ball peen hammer goes
07:40 ting ting ting on the first little
07:42 support beam down below and I think you
07:45 should change this whole thing and I'm
07:46 just like hmm not gonna happen
07:48 sorry I mean it could happen but you're
07:50 gonna have to build something as big to
07:52 illustrate how what I've spent a lot of
07:56 time researching and fortifying and
07:59 checking isn't true then I'll take it
08:03 down because I don't want to hurt
08:04 anybody right let alone myself right I
08:07 think this is the layer of folks that
08:10 were the very first people to perhaps
08:11 wake up to anything and because there's
08:15 there have been disinformation people
08:17 out there I mean remember anonymous what
08:19 a [ __ ] joke that place those that
08:20 group was you know just ran their mouths
08:23 constantly and it looked like a big you
08:26 know blackhat organization which is the
08:28 bad guy organization which is kind of
08:31 weird because there's some white hat you
08:33 know black hat and phrases being used
08:36 and the white hat the physical white hat
08:40 is used by the black hats as well so I
08:42 don't know where any what he came up
08:43 with this horrible designation but it's
08:45 a bad designation but anyway but imagine
08:48 you went out and you believed in
08:50 something and then it changed mijin you
08:51 believed in the what was it comit√© 2012
08:57 do I have that right the kid who ended
08:59 up in KL traded in San Diego roaming
09:03 around high on some drug the whole you
09:08 know he was the one that filmed the the
09:11 warlords supposedly in Africa who had
09:15 taken a bunch of women aside and they
09:17 kept portraying it like a bunch of great
09:19 grade school girl
09:20 right that we're being raped and that
09:23 the dot you know who knows what's
09:24 happening in Africa
09:25 nobody does right but they finally
09:27 returned in the photograph of this I
09:29 probably kony 2012 kony camera the hell
09:33 the name of that movement we finally
09:34 showed the picture of all these women
09:36 and they're all grown women you know you
09:40 can't save the whole world man you can't
09:42 sometimes you just got to wait for them
09:43 to stand up for themselves you know part
09:46 of it is like how do you think first
09:48 world nations evolve to the genetic IQ
09:52 that they have they worked really hard
09:54 and they they found the mother of
09:57 invention through repression and
09:59 suppression and obstacles and gaps in
10:02 their scripts and then they figured out
10:03 how to build that bridge from point A to
10:05 point B and when they wanted to move
10:07 more stuff over the bridge broke and
10:09 people died and so they built a stronger
10:11 one and then duh d'duh duh duh duh duhhh
10:12 it's how we made it so you can't do
10:14 anything about nations that are built of
10:17 people that don't have the genetic code
10:19 to fight for their sovereignty you know
10:23 in the end you might say well they're
10:25 you know they have big armies and these
10:26 people will get killed it's like you
10:28 know what at some point you need to say
10:30 to yourself it'd be better to be [ __ ]
10:32 dead than to live in a tyrannical world
10:34 and so you just keep marching people
10:37 into that flame until it goes out and
10:40 then you lob the heads off of the
10:43 [ __ ] that we're oppressing you in
10:44 the first place right ask France so what
10:48 is the problem with the 70 movement
10:50 right now the problem is is that
10:51 everybody has this everybody grabs an
10:54 agenda and they wanted to be resolved
10:56 immediately and we're all guilty of
10:59 having those feelings right but the one
11:02 thing that's causing my friend a lot of
11:03 angst and I understand the ynx trust me
11:06 but it's this Julian Assange thing that
11:10 he has been captured out of the
11:13 Ecuadorian consulate and he's now in
11:15 prison and now he's sick he's supposedly
11:17 in the infirmary he's not doing well and
11:21 who knows man who knows what's true who
11:24 knows what's not what's interesting
11:26 about it is that the United States added
11:28 17 extra charges on him okay sending a
11:32 number signal
11:34 Senator Rand Paul Ron Paul's son who's a
11:37 senator has introduced the idea of
11:39 getting this guy you know a pardon
11:45 supporters of the 17 guy dude named Joe
11:48 em on Twitter says he's going to be
11:52 saved as soon as he gets over here okay
11:56 well Joe em makes all of 17s videos that
12:00 he really promotes and so whoever this
12:05 scam is or whatever right is part of
12:08 that movement and they're saying it's
12:09 all gonna be okay
12:10 who knows me but [ __ ] happens right
12:13 Julian Assange himself could not know
12:15 what the hell's gonna happen to him and
12:18 off himself or run his mouth too much or
12:22 whine like a [ __ ] in prison who knows
12:23 and just pisses somebody off and there's
12:26 a flash moment that occurs and he gets
12:29 himself in major trouble instead of
12:30 chilling out who knows nobody knows the
12:33 truth maybe Pamela Anderson knows the
12:35 truth nobody wishes this guy any harm
12:39 who's who's halfway intelligent the dude
12:43 saved the world from the deep state
12:47 taking over America huge but if this guy
12:51 isn't literally released from prison
12:54 given a steak dinner and the medal of
12:58 honor and a statue 50,000 feet tall
13:00 isn't built in his and his honor
13:03 then the 17 guy isn't real and our
13:07 President of the United States is a bad
13:09 guy and it's as if you know you you have
13:13 a leader who might be the leader of your
13:15 little town and you know the corrupt
13:18 factions been in charge of that town for
13:21 a really long time and so for some
13:23 reason they can't just put a bullet in
13:24 his head
13:25 they can't do it there's too much too
13:27 many guards too much Intel they can't
13:29 figure out how to make that plan work
13:30 and so all they do is they start burning
13:32 down houses they start race riots they
13:36 start all this other stuff and then you
13:38 get someone walking in and going hey we
13:42 have a plan we're gonna get rid of these
13:44 people
13:45 watch the fireworks and each one of
13:48 these individuals who are lighting fires
13:50 and doing this stuff start to have
13:52 problems a lot of people resign a lot of
13:55 people move away there's less fires
13:58 there's less damage there's still fires
14:00 and they're still damaged because
14:01 there's still people that are clean they
14:03 can't be wiped out in any other way then
14:06 you have this fourth person who comes in
14:09 and goes well if the leader can't stop
14:11 all this chaos then the dude who says
14:13 they got a plan is not real how do you
14:18 like those odds in life right you know
14:21 you're supposed to go to college and get
14:22 a degree and then go get a job and so
14:25 you go through one the horrible
14:27 education in America you get absolutely
14:30 worthless degree from a college and said
14:31 you would have a job prospect afterwards
14:33 the second you get out of college the
14:36 globe list of the world crashes the
14:38 economy and you can't find a job and
14:40 then your [ __ ] parents on this I
14:42 going well you're such a loser
14:44 because you can't fight all these
14:46 elements and and beat them all in the
14:48 first day that's sort of how I feel
14:50 about this this accusation the 17 isn't
14:54 real now there's two sides to the
14:58 equation of seventeen being real or fake
15:00 two sides to it and it's so unbelievably
15:03 important had a close friend of mine who
15:06 was absolutely a static that Obama was
15:08 going to win the presidency and I said
15:14 you know I don't understand what your
15:15 big deal is with this guy like why do
15:17 you think it's such a big deal and
15:21 secretly let me just tell you this I
15:23 think there's some white people out
15:25 there who lived through segregation who
15:27 lived through that whole thing and they
15:29 said the n-word a few too many times in
15:31 context they they thought for maybe
15:35 decades that black people were inferior
15:37 they held conversations maybe they even
15:39 did something to hurt a black person and
15:41 I think about of them were the triple K
15:44 enthusiasts Democrats and so what
15:47 happened was is they flipped in their
15:49 own brain they flipped realized how
15:51 racist they were how horrible they were
15:53 and they simply wanted Obama to be
15:55 President so that would sort of get some
15:58 of the stink off their body
15:59 right those of us who grew up integrated
16:02 with the black communities and consider
16:04 them part of our genetics and our family
16:07 we don't have that guilt so we're always
16:09 just picking the best person doesn't
16:11 matter what color anybody is or what
16:13 gender and you what he is but anyway
16:16 we're walking down the street together
16:18 is due tonight and he's talking about
16:20 how amazing it's gonna be you know so
16:22 like I don't get him in and he stops
16:24 walking and he goes yes you don't get
16:28 you know how powerful the symbolism is
16:30 of Obama but I'm like no I think I do I
16:35 think I really do
16:36 I think you've [ __ ] blown a bunch of
16:38 smoke up your own ass but go ahead and
16:41 he says it's hope it's like it's hope
16:43 that America isn't a racist that I'm
16:46 like it you are projecting from your
16:48 insides is what you're doing
16:50 and you don't even know it you think
16:53 you're you know knocking out the hundred
16:55 eighty IQ this is not a hundred eighty
16:57 guy queue moment what was the poster
17:00 this Shepard Fairey made and got a
17:02 felony
17:03 copyright charge for the hope poster all
17:07 right ask any American how hope worked
17:11 out for them hope disabled anybody doing
17:14 anything real and it turned into a [ __ ]
17:19 show quantitative easing stole
17:22 everybody's value of their savings
17:24 account we had Wars and what nine
17:26 different theaters the guy gets a
17:28 [ __ ] Nobel Peace Prize on the first
17:30 day you know the list goes on we could
17:34 talk for three hours about how that dude
17:37 was absolutely ineffective on anything
17:40 but installing the the framework of a
17:43 dystopian tyrannical globalist Huxley
17:49 1984 world that's what that guy did
17:51 sealed his own record so you couldn't
17:54 figure out where the guy was born or
17:55 where he's from you know I mean the guy
17:57 is just a piece of [ __ ] times infinity
18:00 all right you do not want to be caught
18:04 on the wrong side of defending that dude
18:07 because everything you ever believed
18:10 about that guy unless it's something
18:12 nasty
18:13 isn't true and he's a he's a product of
18:17 his world I mean you know he's just a
18:19 puppet he's a marionette of the of the
18:21 establishment that he crawled into but
18:24 there's a point when you're a complete
18:25 loser and you'll do anything to be a
18:27 winner and they say look we just want to
18:29 put our hand up your ass and we'll make
18:32 you look good for to some people for a
18:34 little while in the end we're all into
18:36 sacrificial moments in life so you're
18:38 gonna be won in the end probably but
18:41 you'll be rich until that last moment so
18:46 that's the flip side equation of the
18:49 seventeen movement on the seventeen
18:50 movement what's going on what word was
18:53 never used in the 70 movement has never
18:56 been used hope hope is a fake emotion
19:01 it's a fake objective it is nothing it
19:04 is sit there and do nothing
19:06 and literally pulse' fire self towards
19:08 humanity do nothing
19:10 look what could I say you know let's
19:14 you're going to do a contest you're
19:16 gonna play a game baseball football
19:19 whatever you're going to draw something
19:22 try to win a contest and I say hey don't
19:24 do that
19:25 just hope it happens what action item
19:29 actionable verb is happening after hope
19:31 nothing 17 has been very explicit about
19:36 who's gonna be exposed and what's going
19:39 on so what does the 17 movement do the
19:42 17 movement think is gonna be about the
19:45 17 movement folks we're gonna talk about
19:46 the other 1 to 17 movement is about one
19:50 core principle of humanity think think
19:59 research
20:01 and what's interesting is is the
20:03 individuals that are doubting 17 in some
20:07 cases are really living in headline news
20:10 they're living in sound bite news
20:11 because they're probably in some cases
20:14 just technically busy but my hope is
20:18 that the person that is unable to do
20:20 their efficient research at what they'll
20:21 end up doing is saying I don't want to
20:24 look into the cauldron of 17 I don't
20:26 want to read any of his posts I just
20:28 want to read an article over here
20:30 written by some deep state activist
20:33 who's going to tell me that this isn't
20:36 real so I don't have to deal with
20:37 anything right I got my little footnote
20:39 over here that says give up and be a big
20:41 [ __ ] about life just let more of this
20:44 [ __ ] tyrannical [ __ ] happen to
20:47 humanity let him crash the [ __ ]
20:49 economy again let him get complete
20:50 control over the place let all the good
20:52 people that have risen up for a one-time
20:54 offer yet exterminated and ruin reduced
20:58 to nothing so then that person can go
21:01 back to [ __ ] complaining about the
21:03 goddamn world constantly this is the
21:07 mezzanine that we have to correct for
21:08 because your baby boomers that don't
21:10 believe we're never gonna believe they
21:11 don't even have a slightest interest in
21:13 believing your Millennials and your Jin
21:15 Z's again the Jin Z's have the highest
21:17 IQs of America's recent history they're
21:22 on board they're the--and they're the
21:24 the autists those that go out and do
21:27 exhaustive research we're gonna start
21:29 nailing some of these Gen Xers that are
21:33 doing ridiculous numerology to try and
21:36 validate the 70 movement it's it's
21:38 that's the biggest in sympho I know of
21:41 so what has allowed the world to turn
21:43 into a big [ __ ] yeah we got first
21:46 world [ __ ] an 80 inch televisions and
21:48 fancy cars and stereos but those
21:50 countries like America and others aren't
21:53 doing too well the European Union give
21:55 me a break European Union is essentially
21:59 the slow boil of tyranny on freedom that
22:05 has to stop alright it has to stop
22:08 so someone comes in the room and says
22:13 okay your biggest problem is you have a
22:14 bidet
22:15 keep the television told you Lee Harvey

22:39 evidence of chip marks on the curbs you

22:48 windshield from the front I mean we got
22:50 all kinds of physical evidence all the
22:52 photos I personally seen of JFK's bullet

23:03 back of his head all those people are
23:04 lying I knew who weren't there know
23:08 everything right not us of course the
23:15 cue is saying research do your due
23:17 diligence and here's a bunch of links
23:20 I'm not going to tell you what to
23:22 believe but I'm gonna show you the
23:24 creepy ass Hollywood people that are
23:26 posting all kinds of weird symbology
23:29 which are in like the FBI database for
23:31 pedophiles again there's that senator
23:34 that lady she's sort of a large black
23:39 lady who's a sinner she wears this
23:42 ever-diminishing
23:43 triangle diamond ring on her finger it's
23:47 the number one FBI symbol for child
23:49 trafficking yeah we're all looking the
23:52 wrong way at Biden is touching little
23:54 girls like crazy and it's not in the
23:55 [ __ ] news and no one's carrying this
23:57 torch where's everybody stupid there's
24:01 everybody stupid that a guy is running
24:02 for president he's being propped up as
24:04 the number one candidate against the
24:05 president knighted States and he's an
24:06 absolute [ __ ] pedophile a camera on
24:09 c-span there's no interpretation when
24:11 his hand goes down to the little girl
24:13 and squeezes her boob and she swats his
24:15 hand away there's no interpretation when
24:17 he's like fairly going after this girl's
24:20 hair and sessions Jeff session swats his
24:22 hand away you can see impugn his junk up

24:33 junk before he walks up to her where's
24:37 my Posse man yeah what I feel like I'm
24:39 the only guy on [ __ ] planet earth
24:40 holding this torch up every single place
24:44 a Biden comment is made a Biden articles
24:46 written you need to be in that thing
24:47 going this guy's a pedophile every
24:50 single time because he is he is a
24:53 scumbag oh maybe he's lightened up until
24:55 he gets the presidency right and he's
24:58 gonna go back he'll have kids through
24:59 that [ __ ] White House like Lolita
25:02 island man he'll be the new Jeffrey
25:05 Epstein trust me
25:06 but don't post 92 things about things
25:10 that don't matter right that's what's
25:13 going on so now what do you think the
25:17 deep state objective would be for us in
25:20 terms of what never to do the deep state
25:23 agenda against us is don't think just
25:28 hope don't take any action just hope
25:31 just become inert until we completely
25:34 control you in some thx 138 fascist
25:39 planet Boston dynamic robots are your
25:44 mommy and daddy you know again like I
25:46 said in a previous episode you know a
25:48 phone booth with a picture of Jesus in
25:50 it is your God
25:51 giving you all the rosaries you need to
25:55 pray for and also there's stuff right
25:58 America as I've said in a previous
26:00 episode is nothing more than an idea and
26:02 it's an idea that was hashed in Europe
26:05 and what's interesting is if you go all
26:08 the way back it's an idea that was more
26:11 than an idea most like the age of the
26:14 Egyptians it took a while for us to
26:17 incur hardships and mess with our brains
26:20 to the point that we ended up stealing
26:22 from each other
26:24 you took a while we ended up stealing
26:28 from each other lying to each other in
26:30 all these things and then you know we
26:35 moved north and it becomes like probably
26:37 we're fine in the Giza Plateau area
26:40 right and then we move nor
26:42 across that Mediterranean Sea and then
26:45 all of a sudden we find ourselves in a
26:47 much more formidable more formidable
26:49 area with predators we've never seen
26:51 weather conditions we've never seen and
26:53 so we got a beg borrow and steal
26:56 literally and murder perhaps in order to
26:59 survive and so that bred in us a
27:01 regressed gene pool which then
27:04 eventually evolves and by way of sheer
27:09 correcting it and finding the mother of
27:12 invention we became really smart about
27:15 how to get around this kind of stuff but
27:17 it took probably thousands of years to
27:19 pull it off and so then we have Magna
27:23 Carter about a thousand AD the robber
27:27 barons right they put that thing
27:28 together and there's a little bit of
27:29 repetition here between like the last
27:30 ten episodes but this is important it's
27:35 hatched it's signed then it gets
27:37 immediately screwed with then we slip
27:40 all the way back into absolute you know
27:44 Christian you know Inquisition tyranny
27:49 the church takes over eventually Henry
27:52 the one of the eighth titles the church
27:53 to go screw itself etc such here but
27:56 eventually this group of Mason's rises
27:59 up because you have to look at it the
28:03 Masons got replaced by the money
28:05 changers on that Friday the 13th that
28:07 infamous day the money changers don't
28:09 care about tyranny or the church because
28:11 they got so much money to control the
28:12 place but the Masons didn't the Masons
28:14 were displaced but they were used to
28:16 power and so they go off and hide and
28:18 they hatch a plan they hear about you
28:20 know this other continent across the
28:23 ocean there and they're like all right
28:24 well it's it's gonna be rough but let's
28:27 go ahead and set up shop over there
28:28 we're gonna Rob the queens and kings of
28:31 Europe to finance this thing we'll get
28:34 over there well load the place up it's
28:36 gonna take a few hundred years we will
28:38 personally never see the benefit of
28:40 these areas but eventually our kids will
28:42 and doughnuts we get the forefathers of
28:44 America did we get the dream 1776 we
28:49 start moving into the paperwork of
28:51 having fought the Revolutionary War dah
28:54 dah dah
28:54 and then the
28:56 19:13 they get to take it all over again
28:58 16th ammendment fake money now the money
29:02 changers control America it's been a
29:04 little over 100 years since that
29:05 occurred time to take it back but now I
29:10 have a policy and I think I said this a
29:12 long time ago and Jack Black and his
29:16 first album of Tenacious D with cage hey
29:22 they're writing music together and and
29:23 cages
29:25 he's a super-duper touring musician you
29:26 know classical train tire player and
29:28 he's trying to suggest a few changes to
29:31 the song and then Jack Black's like oh
29:33 my god he's like you're always nee Singh
29:36 you know he's like I [ __ ] hate
29:38 naysayers and you'll find that in life
29:42 as you try to create things from scratch
29:43 and make things better you will have
29:46 your penny arcade folks off to the side
29:48 nice and everything and it's like you
29:51 know what that doesn't take intelligence
29:53 starting around and pissing on
29:54 everything without any constructive you
29:58 know fallback to say well you know you
29:59 might try this because you know that
30:01 thing you're doing is done a lot over
30:03 here and people might be tired might be
30:05 tired of it dad did that to done you you
30:07 constructively correct somebody but
30:10 there's a lot of naysayers in the world
30:12 that want to feel SuperDuper and
30:13 intellectual they actually think that
30:15 the more they may say something they get
30:17 sort of a micro percentage increase on
30:19 their intelligence quota quotient rate
30:21 not true naysaying is giving up on a
30:25 particular theory conclusively proving
30:29 that something is untrue now that's
30:31 something totally different that's
30:33 actually super valuable to society but
30:36 just sitting there being you know the
30:38 debbie downer whiner on everything well
30:40 whatever
30:41 once you find a club and then when you
30:43 end up you know slashing your own throat
30:46 with a straight razor well know how that
30:48 worked out you know we're in the
30:51 productive in this particular show we're
30:53 in the productive wing of society well
30:55 we don't have all the answers but
30:56 goddamn it we're not sitting around nice
30:58 in we're sitting around exploring trying
31:00 to figure out what is true and what is
31:02 false for the absolute benefit of
31:04 mankind with the substrate rule
31:08 do no harm to the best of our ability
31:12 now I should say this too in the
31:15 absolute definition of do no harm you
31:17 know I was spanked I don't know six or
31:21 seven times when I was a kid like ones
31:24 that I remember probably less than that
31:25 probably about four or five times but
31:27 anyway you might say well your dad
31:29 harmed you and I'd say yeah I did and
31:35 other than a couple times we had cuts or
31:37 some bad information the rest of the
31:40 times were times that probably saved my
31:43 life
31:43 or increase the absolute appreciation
31:46 for life and kind of woke me up one of
31:49 them was I had wandered away from the
31:51 house because three or four years old
31:53 I'm just falling all the other kids in
31:54 the neighborhood and I'm down by a
31:55 stream I'm not an idiot but I could have
31:59 fallen into the stream I could have you
32:00 know gotten hurt whatever my dad finds
32:03 me like he was a black walk he's seen
32:05 his UPS outfit you know and he's walking
32:07 across the street he sees me and he
32:08 grabs me and pop pop pop hits my ass and
32:11 and I'm I was having the time of my life
32:13 and then all of a sudden I'm not having
32:15 the time of my life but what that taught
32:17 me was don't go roaming off kid you
32:20 don't know the dangers of the world you
32:22 could cross the street and get killed
32:23 you could get hit by a dirtbike because
32:24 this was a big dirt bike trail and there
32:27 weren't any motorcycles here at the time
32:29 but I could have been hurt saved my life
32:32 in the long run so sometimes humans
32:35 because we're not completely developed
32:37 intellectually at least boys like me you
32:40 yeah you need to spank us everyone small
32:42 it didn't happen to get after probably
32:46 age of like nine I was extremely rude to
32:50 a babysitter that's what happened that
32:51 time but that was all about chivalry if
32:55 you don't talk to a woman like this you
32:56 know you don't do anything I spelled the
33:00 dirty word towards her towards and said
33:03 it loudly to a friend of mine and she
33:06 heard and told my dad and boy he handled
33:08 that situation but anyway back to the
33:10 point here seventeen is saying to become
33:15 the most sentient human being you could
33:17 possibly become question everything
33:20 and the concern which i think is a full
33:23 level of intellectual 'ti is that he's
33:25 going to flip at the last second and
33:27 [ __ ] us all and it's like okay I guess I
33:32 guess as possible
33:34 you know what's gonna stop them from
33:36 taking this cover story that Los Angeles
33:38 has so much trash laying around that the
33:40 rats are gonna cause the next plague how
33:44 [ __ ] [ __ ] is that I mean seriously
33:46 why did the plague blow up in Europe
33:48 because no one could figure out that it
33:50 was in the water supply and that was
33:52 traveling through the rodents today we
33:55 know that technique and it's never going
33:57 to happen
33:58 yeah some people might die off because
33:59 they accidentally bump into this thing
34:02 but no in order to correct the plague in
34:04 2019 / 2020 and ain't a big deal believe
34:09 me there wouldn't be that many rats in
34:11 LA after it's over but what about San
34:12 Francisco which is like 60% covered in
34:15 human feces I mean it really it's a
34:17 hundred percent of the entire town is
34:20 covered in feces
34:21 to it like gross levels I mean what
34:24 about that D coli the travels in that no
34:27 cover story about that getting the
34:28 plague but oh boy la is gonna have this
34:30 thing and that's predictive programming
34:32 article that they write such that they
34:34 could drop some sort of sickness blame
34:36 it on rats and they're cleaning this out
34:38 so flipping at the last second well if
34:44 they're gonna flip at the last second to
34:46 hurt us all then why would they be
34:49 fighting so much to get rid of so many
34:51 bad politicians cleaning the swamp out
34:54 as it were exposing celebrities and all
34:57 their pedophilia doesn't sound like
34:59 anyone was cleaning out anything but all
35:00 the bad stuff does it sound like the
35:02 flip is about to occur now here's the
35:05 thing someone who's nice saying the 17
35:08 movement and propping themselves up as
35:10 this huge intellectual for being able to
35:12 say this isn't gonna work
35:14 because that's what everybody's doing
35:15 right he's on this kind of quasi I don't
35:18 know if I believe thing okay well what
35:21 if they don't succeeded absolutely
35:22 everything that they want to do are you
35:24 gonna be standing there patting yourself
35:26 on the back going we'll see I told you
35:28 you know they didn't they didn't get
35:30 that one done any of this this whole
35:31 thing was a setup it's like
35:34 you know what happened you didn't do
35:36 [ __ ] all to help out you sat on your ass
35:38 while everyone else [ __ ] pitched in
35:40 tried to get something done and all we
35:42 needed to get this thing to the next
35:44 level was one more hand one more
35:46 intellectual push one more dissemination
35:49 of truthful information is all we needed
35:52 but you sat down on the sidelines being
35:54 this pseudo intellectual genius nay
35:57 saying the whole thing America is an
36:00 idea of freedom that's what it is
36:03 it was hatched in Europe we brought it
36:05 over here we're hanging on to it for
36:08 [ __ ] dear life trying to keep our
36:09 Second Amendment alive try to get away
36:11 all these ridiculous restrictions on the
36:13 Second Amendment because in armed
36:16 society is a super safe society I'll
36:18 tell you and the more you have sidearms
36:20 the crime goes down drastically in those
36:22 areas we just had a brand new report
36:24 released that proves this it's always
36:27 been the case yeah there's been dodge
36:29 cities tombstones and dead woods out
36:32 there but they're notorious for having
36:34 gold and other things that people went
36:37 to go do playing cards and a bunch of
36:39 stuff and sure the idiots shoot each
36:41 other fine [ __ ] Darwin's doing his
36:42 thing okay great you know you don't hear
36:45 about you know Nikola Tesla being
36:48 murdered by a cowboy you here cowboy
36:51 against cowboy okay so 17 if nothing
36:56 else is a thought process it is an idea
36:59 defend yourself
37:00 understand what sovereignty is
37:02 understand what tyranny is I understand
37:03 where we're going I understand where
37:05 we've been and let's not go back well
37:09 let's go back to the good you know last
37:11 you know 50 60 years ago - the Democrats
37:15 racism and segregation that they were
37:17 for in the KKK that they created to
37:20 terrorize the blacks of this nation
37:22 let's not do that let's do the
37:24 Republican side of things like Martin
37:26 Luther King the one of the most amazing
37:29 black Republicans to ever exist let's do
37:33 more that so I read a lot of comments
37:36 that people make on articles because I
37:39 find it to be the most interesting kind
37:41 sort of cross section of humanity and
37:44 what I find interesting is if I go off
37:47 into liberal
37:48 typically I find the robots the PR firms
37:51 the ones that are continually
37:53 brainwashing they're ignorant followers
37:56 what I found interesting was that
37:58 recently a couple leftist rags like
38:01 tmz.com and a few other ones a few
38:06 others that aren't related to the news
38:07 of like tech industry websites and stuff
38:10 like that where the issue of sjw's will
38:12 come up the issue of Tim Cook destroying
38:14 Apple comes up and I am seeing for the
38:17 very first time in the last probably
38:18 eight months people starting to get
38:21 tired of being told things that aren't
38:23 true the amount of criticism on TMZ
38:26 against the the very cultural movement
38:31 of TMZ com TMZ is like a rag to get your
38:34 kids to be the biggest [ __ ] losers on
38:35 planet earth your daughters are to be
38:38 [ __ ] you know Instagram [ __ ] and
38:40 your boys are supposed to tattoo their
38:42 faces beat up your girls and [ __ ] I
38:46 don't know get murdered by somebody in
38:47 the middle of a parking lot the more
38:50 degenerate a human being is the more
38:52 they accelerates in these platforms it's
38:56 just fascinating to watch because it's
38:57 right in front of your face it's
38:58 interesting but what's what I've found
39:00 so far as it seems like the actual human
39:03 integrity and human replies a non robot
39:05 PR firm well-thought-out answers are
39:08 happening on the right which is sort of
39:11 surprising to me like Fox comm has a lot
39:16 of well-thought-out responses that look
39:19 very organic they're not all the same
39:21 but not towing necessarily agendas are
39:23 just commenting on things and it's I'm
39:25 actually surprised because that is not
39:27 exactly the most legit rag either for me
39:32 that's a sign that the tide has turned
39:33 in a really big way towards the same
39:36 agendas that the 17 guy is trying to say
39:38 pay attention to this this is important
39:40 and for those of you don't know the 17
39:44 individual is supposedly about 9 to 10
39:47 people it's still out there whether or
39:50 not every time the 17 dude posts as to
39:56 whether or not it's one person sitting
39:57 up all the posts or whether or not there
40:00 are multiple people not
40:01 many maybe three or four that are
40:03 actually posting on behalf of the same
40:05 handle to propagate information I think
40:08 a lot of the responses to his posts are
40:11 instigated by his own people so that the
40:13 issues fall out so people can sort of
40:16 get the clues to the game to succeed and
40:21 finding the information they need to
40:23 find but imagine let's just take julian
40:26 assange situation for one second because
40:29 it sort of been laid down by the cube
40:32 movement that he is going to be brought
40:34 to the United States and he's going to
40:36 be pardoned that is what the cue
40:37 resource team says now they have said
40:41 this publicly the Joe M dude said it q
40:44 has said it and so what could the deef
40:46 state do to hurt q and then get all
40:49 these people that are sitting on the
40:50 fence nay saying everything to get them
40:55 to flip and think this whole thing is
40:57 fake and to say C June Assange died in
41:00 prison and so the 17 thing isn't real
41:04 because he said he was going to be
41:05 pardoned
41:06 so what could what could this possibly
41:08 be the 17 guy says he's part of the
41:10 Trump administration he's part of the
41:12 NSA he's part of the military and then
41:16 he has his outside folks that have
41:17 Twitter accounts and YouTube accounts
41:19 and whatever they know if this is the
41:24 this to say it's all legit so the deep
41:26 state knows that they are trying to get
41:28 this guy pardoned well there's a couple
41:32 problems there he's in the control of
41:35 one of the five AI organizations which
41:37 is Britain unless Donald Trump is going
41:41 over there and telling the Queen nothing
41:43 better happened to Jay a Jew no such
41:46 nothing better happened to that guy
41:47 because I got a lot of dirt on your ass
41:50 and I'm willing to exchange the
41:55 concealing of some dirt permanently for
41:58 his life so you can do whatever you want
42:01 but he needs to come over here in one
42:03 piece you need to make sure he's not
42:05 mentally disturbed like you know Kim
42:07 jong-un's torturing of an American who
42:09 [ __ ] dies like three days later Sun
42:11 [ __ ] right he's got to come back in
42:13 one piece and you know
42:15 come to America for the first time one
42:16 piece and I'm gonna pardon him but
42:19 imagine that that occurs he will take
42:21 that first stance that she agrees and
42:25 she's gonna turn a new leaf her whatever
42:27 that needs to happen over there the guy
42:29 comes over here safely well he's over
42:33 here now he's in the Hillary hit team
42:36 realm he's gonna get our concidered
42:38 potentially so what can the president do
42:40 the guys got I literally have wutface
42:42 surgery and be hidden in Albuquerque
42:45 somewhere he's gotta live in the White
42:47 House until he dies I mean like what can
42:49 you do to save this guy because as soon
42:51 as he gets over here gets pardoned one
42:53 of these DNC John Podesta Wetworks that
42:57 they pulled on judge Scalia to get
43:00 Loretta Lynch to take his position it
43:04 happens to Julian Assange and then what
43:06 is then Trump a bad guy is 17 a bad guy
43:09 because he gets wasted after he gets
43:11 here and gets pardoned I don't know but
43:16 now let's say that they want to nip this
43:17 thing in the bud really early and they
43:19 just kill him in prison and boy they
43:22 create a story they create a it was just
43:24 an inmate who was [ __ ] who you know
43:28 it has a violent streak and Julian
43:29 Assange was getting his meal and the guy
43:31 stuffed a you know dinner tray down his
43:35 throat and he dies hangs him with the
43:38 black belt then 117 not true Trump not
43:44 real all this other stuff do you feel
43:47 super brilliant with that deduction
43:49 kim.com can [ __ ] pat himself on the
43:52 back that everybody's horrible but him
43:55 what's interesting about the people that
43:57 nice say this stuff is I don't think
43:59 they feel like they're a part of a group
44:02 it's sort of like I you know I know some
44:05 friends of mine that it's like they're
44:07 not happy unless they're pointing out
44:09 something horrible in the world with
44:11 sort of the overtone that we're gonna
44:14 make that thing butter and this thing is
44:15 gonna go away and we go on to the next
44:17 thing that's horrible and we fix that
44:19 but what's interesting is when you
44:20 listen to them for an extended period of
44:22 time
44:22 what sometimes happens is you realize
44:25 well if the world
44:28 became fantastic overnight which by the
44:30 way it's never gonna happen in your
44:32 lifetime okay ever but if it all became
44:38 great what these people commit suicide
44:41 would they just have nothing to live for
44:43 I don't know that's why it's super
44:47 important you have your own projects and
44:48 your own life and you live your own life
44:50 because you cannot go into every
44:53 person's dysfunctional world whether it
44:57 be a country an individual the town a
44:59 relationship or your friends how healthy
45:02 someone's dog is when they die
45:04 all things die you know I have these and
45:08 I understand it because I lost you know
45:11 as part of a my buddies dog that died
45:15 and it was very sudden and you know
45:18 again it's right around the time the bad
45:20 Chinese food came over and this dog just
45:21 drops like a sack of you know potatoes
45:25 with cancer perfectly fine up to that
45:28 point you spent all this money on it we
45:31 had this vigil for him and you know it
45:34 was very emotional but I see posts
45:38 online you know dragging these dog
45:41 deaths out four or even cats and stuff
45:44 but dragging them out for weeks on
45:46 social media and it's like oh you know
45:50 these are some of these things that if
45:52 you need assistance and getting over
45:54 these things ask for the assistance in
45:57 your own consciousness please don't
45:59 share the despair of your situation with
46:03 the entire world just trying to spread
46:05 it on the society right I got a bad
46:07 situation so let me spread it on society
46:09 so other people who have in great days
46:12 and who would otherwise potentially
46:14 attract positivity to the life are now
46:16 attracting a bunch of negativity to the
46:17 life because they're being sucked into
46:20 social media discourse of destruction
46:26 you know so I was at a place last night
46:29 and that's where a bunch of my friends
46:32 get together and somebody walks in with
46:35 a anti-trump shirt on and he's a great
46:39 guy
46:41 and you know whether I've seen him where
46:43 before and we're not there to talk about
46:45 politics or anything like that but he
46:46 wears and he's like yeah you know I love
46:48 it and and I know some people don't like
46:50 it and it's and then I I'm like in there
46:55 he's wearing that shirt again so I
46:56 turned across the table and this woman
46:59 across the table love her to death she
47:01 wanted one of the most wonderful human
47:03 human beings on planet Earth and she
47:04 said yeah I don't like Trump because
47:06 he's so mean all the time he's so
47:08 negative all the time like really what
47:14 side are you on what side are you on
47:15 that's so [ __ ] positive right because
47:18 you can't be on the Democrat side
47:19 you can't they've been attacking this
47:23 guy at an unprecedented level in world
47:27 history I mean seriously if you were to
47:29 if you were to go back in some really
47:32 autistic fashion and find every negative
47:34 article about this guy since he
47:36 announced him his office for president
47:38 and then all the arrogant interviews
47:40 with the deep state operatives that said
47:43 Trump will never be President you know
47:45 what he said Donald Trump will never be
47:47 President on the Trump never that was
47:48 uttered a million times Pelosi and Obama
47:52 and George Clooney you know all these
47:56 [ __ ] deep Staters men and you know
47:59 that's that's sort of an anti
48:01 constitutional thing to say what if you
48:03 ran for president I just walked around
48:05 going that person will never be
48:06 President well how do I know maybe you
48:10 do win and the dude won wasn't at 99
48:14 percent to 1 and then eventually it was
48:16 he had 0% chance and then he [ __ ]
48:19 wins it and so I look across the table
48:22 and I said oh really so is that your
48:25 standard that a person can be attacked
48:30 24/7 by every single major media outlet
48:32 in the world
48:33 it's an international effort by the deep
48:36 state he never draws first blood right
48:40 Rosie O'Donnell says something bad about
48:42 Trump Trump then fires back and because
48:45 he fires back much better than she fires
48:48 he's the bad guy and I had people come
48:53 to me afterwards and say
48:54 Wow you really handled that well and you
48:56 made me really think about my own
48:57 opinion about this because you're right
49:00 we're cutting blank checks to all these
49:02 negative deep State v I press 8 and it's
49:06 like it's every single newspaper
49:08 magazine you know again Fox is the only
49:11 one that pretends to be right-wing and I
49:14 think Hannity pretend potentially now
49:16 and Tucker
49:17 Carl Carlson Tucker he's like maybe
49:21 those two guys are the only guys that
49:22 I've seen truly stay flipped on the
49:25 other side but who knows you know I
49:27 think they have some decent integrity
49:30 but we haven't had we haven't seen them
49:33 have the imperative to flip the other
49:36 way so if it flips the other way and the
49:38 70 movement fails because there's too
49:40 many [ __ ] brilliant naysayers out
49:42 there and Trump's I'm unable to get
49:44 reelected or whatever and it all falls
49:46 apart or these guys are gonna flip and
49:48 go back deep state if you see them not
49:51 flip back to the deep state then we can
49:53 write down in their epitaph truly exited
49:58 the deep state and state out of the deep
49:59 state their entire life my reason for
50:04 writing down arresting the truth
50:06 sort of has to do with obviously if the
50:09 truth is ever presented the shallow
50:12 minds of the world be it you know
50:14 intentionally shallow or lazily shallow
50:16 are going to be the ones that
50:19 essentially say I've built my entire
50:21 life on the principle of everything
50:24 sucking and so subliminally I am going
50:28 to make the world suck the second anyone
50:30 shows up to actually fix anything I will
50:34 not believe I will they say I will not
50:38 contribute and I will not do any true
50:41 investigation and research nor follow
50:44 movements as they happen so you're
50:46 unable to ever form any logic gates in
50:48 your mind when it comes to making a
50:50 deduction on your own it's all sound
50:52 bites what a sound bite sound bites are
50:54 do not turn on that motor that is your
50:56 brain stay off and watch the you know
51:00 the ticker-tape words you go across your
51:03 visual cortex and then
51:07 the world's gonna stay shitty oh that's
51:10 good cuz all I ever do is [ __ ]
51:12 complain about everything constantly mmm
51:15 welcome to your new life
51:18 some of us want to vibrate out of this
51:20 frequency because we didn't go roll up
51:23 in those worlds we grew up in a good
51:24 world and so we have a reference in our
51:27 mind of a great childhood of a great you
51:30 know geez the first decade and a half of
51:32 my life professionally was utterly
51:36 phenomenal and I had to work my ass off
51:38 I didn't have a college degree in
51:41 anything that I did so I had to teach
51:44 myself had to be proactive all my
51:47 friends were [ __ ] around and drinking
51:49 and sitting at bars and all the other
51:51 stuff I was home researching testing
51:55 writing music painting selling all my
51:58 painting selling my music you know I had
52:01 the next video game design before my
52:02 company needed it etc etc hopefully
52:08 that's us you know I'm gonna throw a
52:12 little zinger near towards the last
52:15 portion of this particular episode and
52:18 it's not even a it's not profound when
52:23 you really think about it but it might
52:24 be more interesting if you'd never put
52:27 this on point in your brain and you may
52:30 have put this on point within a
52:31 fictional movie or something but this is
52:33 where we get to kind of think about a
52:35 little bit further a lot of me a lot of
52:39 my mind goes okay a lot of times I say
52:41 look how is it that the absurdly
52:46 ridiculous is such a natural thing in
52:49 this world that treating people in ways
52:51 that you would never treat them like all
52:53 the wars that we have around the world
52:55 and these fake reasons why we hate each
52:56 other why is this so easily easily
53:00 pushed forward we have you know I don't
53:02 know what the percentage is but it's got
53:04 to be a low single percentage of Islamic
53:07 Muslims are in this Muslim Brotherhood
53:10 thing of I'm gonna take over the world
53:12 little girls talking about decapitating
53:14 kids on on YouTube their [ __ ] videos
53:17 don't get banned you know you've got a
53:19 bunch of clerics
53:20 in England saying we will eventually go
53:23 door-to-door and if you don't profess
53:25 your belief in Islam we're going to
53:28 exterminate you immediately and go to
53:31 the next door this is on this is okay no
53:35 [ __ ] British you know Shelley [ __ ]
53:37 cop is going to that clerics mosque and
53:40 saying hey you know you said some things
53:42 a little inflammatory no it's the white
53:44 guy over there going hey everybody did
53:46 you see what the cleric [ __ ] said he
53:48 said he's gonna kill everybody doesn't
53:49 want to change religions oh there's the
53:51 [ __ ] chili ass cops you know they go
53:53 over there and knock on the door well
53:54 you might be inciting some violence
53:56 against Islam really we have all these
54:02 alien sci-fi shows and they talk about
54:07 you know and there's like there's loose
54:10 you know conspiracies that are more
54:13 sci-fi we're like you know chemtrails in
54:15 the sky or transforming our atmosphere
54:18 to make it ready for their atmosphere
54:22 and when you watch they live which
54:25 hopefully that episodes air before this
54:27 one you have a situation where they're
54:32 transforming the world to make it
54:36 prepared for their kind you know in a
54:39 way it's not quite on point like that
54:40 but you know Rod Serling talked about
54:43 pre censorship and he didn't I don't
54:46 think he understood that project
54:47 Mockingbird was already in full effect
54:49 by 1959 when he did his interview when
54:52 he talked about this pre censorship you
54:54 ever want to see you know again I say
54:55 this probably a dozen times and 400
54:57 episodes if you want to see a great
54:59 interview by one of the most brilliant
55:00 men on planet Earth
55:02 the 1959 interview of Rod Serling was a
55:05 prophecy of where we are today
55:08 the CIA engaged in a project Mockingbird
55:11 initiative as I told the mid-50s to make
55:15 sure that all the journalists that ever
55:17 got on television and wrote newspapers
55:18 and what-have-you were part of their
55:21 minions and they would say only what
55:24 they were told to say fully illegal
55:26 especially in that time after quiz show
55:29 debacle where they banned propaganda and
55:31 ban lies on television
55:34 this deep state organization that serves
55:36 the bankers of Europe never has ever
55:38 served us right there all Skull and
55:40 Bones graduates specially in 55 they
55:43 were there to make sure that we were
55:45 propagandized away from the American
55:47 dream and everything the Constitution
55:50 stands for so the two heaviest agendas
55:53 in America right now are being obviously
55:55 launched from this cartel this cabal of
56:01 bankers and monarchs and all their
56:04 minions someone asked me recently you
56:07 know what do you mean by banker okay
56:10 it's the people that when you finally
56:13 you know finish the question who owns
56:16 that bank who owns that bank who owns
56:18 that bank who owns that bank and you
56:20 just keep going up the ladder when you
56:22 finally reach a para Meridian capstone
56:25 of the pyramid and it says there are no
56:28 banks over this Bank this is the top
56:30 Bank of all the banks you've asked us
56:32 about and there are many pyramids around
56:34 here but certain families owned pyramids
56:37 of banking and then they get in their
56:40 little clubs and they Cabal Club 300
56:43 Club of Rome all these organizations CFR
56:46 trilateral commission etc etc World Bank
56:50 to which a bank all these folks you'd
56:52 probably Union Bank of London if it
56:54 still exists right but the two major
56:57 agendas going on in America right now
56:59 because we're the last threat for the
57:02 last first world country with one of the
57:04 biggest armies in the world that have
57:07 the second amendment they don't care if
57:10 Iceland you know everybody can wear you
57:13 know Newsies with infinite ammo on their
57:16 back they don't care there's very few
57:18 people there they don't care they nuke
57:20 it from space if it became a problem but
57:22 the United States is a big problem we
57:25 have every single strategic resource
57:27 that we need every single thing we need
57:30 to stay away from everybody we could be
57:33 complete xenophobes if we wanted to if
57:36 the two main agendas in America is
57:38 depopulation agenda and civil discourse
57:42 to the point of a civil war those are
57:45 the two main objectives here
57:47 and that's irrespective of the constant
57:51 manipulation of our economy our
57:53 politicians our businesspeople our
57:56 military people our wall street people
57:58 they're always trying to infiltrate and
58:02 scam you know now that we've had the
58:04 Mueller Report well largely revealed as
58:09 to what's in it hopefully Declassified
58:11 here shortly we know that you know what
58:16 was it Bannon who's a one of these you
58:19 know steel dossier guys he's really
58:21 responsible for creating it for getting
58:23 it created and then submitting it to the
58:25 FISA Court to absolutely perjure himself
58:27 and become a complete treasonous t'k
58:29 person as we understand it he tried to
58:32 infiltrate the Trump administration
58:33 should become some sort of advisor
58:36 because that's what he was told to do
58:38 we'll go ahead and try to get in his
58:39 campaign this is dark [ __ ] this is
58:44 reprehensible behavior no matter how you
58:47 filter the facts of life but what is the
58:50 depopulation algorithm well some of the
58:54 good ones that we should probably be
58:56 leaning on is definitely making sure
59:00 that all the females around the world
59:01 but especially in America feel empowered
59:04 that they're educated and that they
59:07 don't feel like there are things that
59:08 intellectually at least they can't do
59:10 that Amanda's that should be what
59:13 happens I mean come on we remain of the
59:14 same genetics it's just a few little
59:16 outies and in ease that are different
59:18 and so making sure that girls when
59:22 they're being raised as little girls
59:24 don't hear something that says you can't
59:28 you're weak you're a girl now again
59:31 there's a lot of girls in CrossFit you
59:34 know that are getting very muscular as
59:36 well but I'm not really talking about
59:38 that but now they're trying to confuse
59:41 your gender as soon as you grow older it
59:46 was just released that Ellen DeGeneres
59:47 and I this is probably an old story I
59:49 just read about it there's a cover story
59:52 that Ellen DeGeneres's mother finally
59:55 came out and said look I totally regret
59:57 the fact that my daughter was being
59:58 raped by her father
60:00 and I didn't listen to her so think
60:05 about this what are the odds that
60:06 there's this gene that makes you gay and
60:09 her father raped her as a kid she ain't
60:13 the only other person I know in this
60:14 world that had that that beginning I
60:16 know quite a few people who are today
60:19 homosexual either for male or female and
60:22 they were absolutely abused usually
60:25 sexually and raped when they were young
60:27 now I also know some friends of mine
60:29 that are absolutely as straight as can
60:30 be and that happened to them as well
60:31 but sometimes it flips that I don't want
60:34 to be around men men rape it's a scary
60:36 thing soon as a man gets naked I'm
60:38 thinking about my dad and so I am never
60:40 gonna be alone with a with a man totally
60:44 get it it makes sense I have no judgment
60:46 no no negative judgment at all it just
60:48 happens but now that's a severe trauma
60:51 situation but what if you start telling
60:54 kids about all the sexuality stuff in
60:56 grade school in preschool no one said
60:59 that [ __ ] when I was a kid I barely
61:02 understood what homosexuality was in my
61:04 teens I mean everybody kind of knows
61:06 okay either some guys like guys and
61:08 girls like girls all right that's great
61:09 but you don't go diving into it like
61:11 it's a big research project you just
61:13 kind of hear about it you're like okay
61:14 you know I didn't you can't even have a
61:17 negative feeling really cuz you're like
61:19 it just happens you know - am i doing my
61:23 friends when I was young both exhibited
61:27 behavior towards all of us guys that
61:30 they were on the other team they were
61:34 they like guys and we just kind of you
61:37 know just you just maneuver around it
61:38 you know it's like if a guy this is not
61:40 something that occurred but imagine it
61:42 was something as simple as a guy putting
61:43 his arm around you when you're and
61:45 you're a dude and you're like 12 or
61:47 whatever and if it made you feel
61:48 uncomfortable you just kind of move and
61:52 you get their arm off of you but that
61:54 didn't happen to me but I mean that
61:56 would be as simple as it was that's how
61:57 simple it was when we were kids all
62:00 right so there's definitely a social
62:03 conditioning element to it and we've had
62:05 it proven again there's someone in my
62:08 family there was raised like a little
62:09 girl until he was like 12 years old
62:11 because he had a crazy mother and what
62:12 do you think the [ __ ] odds are the
62:14 guy
62:14 hatched with a gene but I was also
62:17 raised like a little girl dressed in
62:18 dresses until he was like 12 and then
62:20 eventually he B he comes out and he's
62:22 gay he was socially conditioned to be
62:27 that way all right he's a great guy
62:31 SuperDuper talented no ill feelings
62:33 whatsoever but that was his story that's
62:35 how he got there so that's happening
62:37 like crazy around the world there will
62:41 always be fashion trends that make men
62:43 look feminine and then fashion trends
62:45 that make men look masculine and
62:46 vice-versa for females I mean think
62:50 about all the 80s bands and in America
62:52 wearing pounds of makeup and it wasn't
62:55 kiss right
62:57 and hey it does reduce population and
63:00 that's something we need to work on I
63:03 don't know that the countries that are
63:04 really having the major issues are are
63:06 actually getting these agendas because
63:08 they're in one case communistic and they
63:10 won't allow it
63:11 and the other one is just I don't know
63:13 they sort of integrate that femininity
63:17 into their world but stay masked a
63:19 heterosexual it's interesting now the
63:22 civil discourse is constantly pushing up
63:25 these agendas
63:27 you know these black life matters things
63:30 the immigration from South America
63:33 things anything you can will the
63:38 Kavanagh thing the me2 movement all
63:40 these weird agendas that you know things
63:45 bad have happened in the category that
63:48 they're talking about but the statistics
63:50 rarely ever prove out their claims you
63:55 know Candace Owens is completely
63:57 dispelled the black lives matter
63:58 statistics it doesn't mean we don't
64:01 improve things and we don't understand
64:04 each other better and you know we should
64:06 educate our police officers to the point
64:08 they have the highest IQ that can
64:09 possibly have instead of the lowest IQ
64:11 we could possibly hire them at because
64:13 that's what we do in America and I'm not
64:15 trying to insult police officers because
64:17 a lot of them for whatever reasons sneak
64:20 through and they're they're very
64:21 intellectual and and they are sort of
64:23 the chieftain within the police
64:24 precincts that they're in and they the
64:27 they take the kid who was hired and
64:29 again this is real data the highest IQ
64:33 you're allowed to have in the United
64:34 States of America above board is 110 and
64:37 around that point they start going well
64:39 this kid's gonna start thinking for
64:40 themselves and we can't have that they
64:42 have to be able to do what we say never
64:44 question orders all right well they come
64:47 in at 105 but they still keep living and
64:50 they still keep reading and they still
64:51 keep getting educated and so they do
64:54 rise way above 110 you might have a 180
65:00 chief of police who runs his or her
65:04 precinct better hints so they keep their
65:08 IQ of all their minions higher and
65:11 higher and so they'd have a great
65:12 community of that obeys they don't shoot
65:15 every single person that that comes out
65:17 of them with a kitchen knife when
65:19 they've got pistols you know but I will
65:23 guarantee you that the left and the deep
65:25 state will always ensure that there are
65:28 reasons to hate everything that is the
65:32 Constitution of the United States always
65:36 unless a tree lets the left completely
65:39 disembowels itself from all of the
65:42 lunacy that they've allowed to be
65:43 elected into their seats you know
65:45 keeping these crazy old [ __ ] that are
65:47 like in their 80s and these silly dudes
65:50 like Schiff and Schumer and Nadler and
65:53 all these guys I mean come on and talk
65:56 about the [ __ ] president and founder
65:58 of unlaid pedophile kid touching NAMBLA
66:01 members all running one organization and
66:04 there's someone will write to but again
66:06 they're being purged like crazy aren't
66:08 they arresting the truth it's a movement
66:14 I'm quoting that phrase but it's a
66:17 movement to make sure that you never
66:19 learn anything about the world you never
66:22 learn anything about humanity you never
66:24 learn anything about science you were to
66:27 stay stupid your entire life and anyone
66:31 who comes out with the emperor has no
66:33 clothes on observation but be they a
66:36 child be they an adult or an elder of
66:39 this world they are to be
66:42 ceremoniously attacked until either they
66:45 changed like the Inquisition forced
66:48 Christianity into the brain of mankind
66:50 because brain because the people at the
66:52 time they had relatives that could
66:54 remember back when supposedly this guy
66:57 walked the earth and they're like they
66:59 did never existed man oh you know it
67:02 comes the Iron Maiden where comes the
67:04 the torture device do you believe now no
67:09 do you believe now no okay number you
67:11 know set it to 11 like they did in
67:12 Princess Bride
67:13 I totally believe there are five lights
67:19 for the naysayers the the oxymoron is
67:22 that they perceive themselves to be
67:24 strong but what is the foundation of a
67:29 naysayer someone who is empirically weak
67:33 that lacks all of the temerity to stick
67:38 up for what is true if they can't
67:43 brainwash your child with words they
67:45 will stunt your child chemically with
67:50 vaccinations and bad food Monsanto has
67:54 been bought by Bayer Aspirin if you have
67:57 Bayer Aspirin in your house I want you
68:00 to pop the lid open your toilet dump it
68:04 all in there flush it throw away the
68:06 bottle and never ever buy Bayer Aspirin
68:08 again don't do it maybe they have the
68:11 one of the worst track records on planet
68:13 Earth go check out how they spread in a
68:15 moon immune deficiency disease in Africa
68:18 they want you to trust your medical
68:20 organizations who are just as bad as
68:24 your profit private for-profit press
68:27 you're supposed to trust your press but
68:29 they're monetizing everything that they
68:31 report and so sensationalizing facts is
68:35 the name of the game but let me ask you
68:37 this let me ask you this little factoid
68:42 here you go to the clinic because you
68:44 got a cold that's all it is just a cold
68:47 but you trust the hospital
68:51 they want to make some money I don't
68:55 want to make some money and so they this
68:58 is not exactly easy to do what I'm
69:00 saying but what I'm about to say you're
69:05 gonna roll your eyes a little bit and
69:06 then you're gonna realize that even if
69:09 even during the roll of your eyes you're
69:11 going to realize that this could
69:12 actually happen to a lot of people and
69:14 probably has happened to some people
69:17 because they don't question anything and
69:19 they don't get second opinions about
69:21 things second opinions are huge second
69:24 opinions I think need to be
69:25 geographically distinct so if you live
69:28 in Los Angeles and you're diagnosed with
69:30 something you might want to go to a
69:31 different more rural area of the world
69:34 to get a second diagnosis and refuse to
69:38 tell them what you've been diagnosed
69:40 with refused to tell them about the
69:42 clinic or the doctor that gave you the
69:45 first diagnosis so they go in completely
69:47 cold it's a double-blind situation so
69:49 that no shenanigans can occur let me
69:52 give you a little scenario that you know
69:54 could happen and probably has happened
69:56 in this world you go in for the cold and
70:00 they take some blood tests and they come
70:02 back and they tell you you've got this
70:04 thing called AIDS you need to be on a TZ
70:07 stat and then all of a sudden your your
70:14 adrenalin and your dopamine flies around
70:17 your body because you don't know what
70:18 the hell to think about this thing
70:20 you're gonna have some bearing of bad
70:23 news and boy if you're good bearing a
70:24 bad news poster on Facebook man you're
70:26 gonna probably feel hi my god I'm gonna
70:28 die isn't this exciting I love telling
70:31 you about all the celebrities that died
70:32 as soon as they die I'm the first person
70:34 on Facebook to tell you hey everybody I
70:37 want you to have a bad day because
70:38 someone so killed themselves last night
70:41 so they'll get on that lethal injection
70:45 crap called A to Z and without ever
70:48 really checking to see if they have
70:50 anything boom they're dead 11 months
70:54 it'll kill you a hospital milks an
70:57 insurance company till you croak
71:03 how many diagnoses have you ever heard
71:06 in your lifetime that were completely
71:07 wrong like I told you a friend of mine
71:10 right before Obamacare went online he
71:13 was diagnosed with a very severe case of
71:17 bladder cancer and was told he's gonna
71:20 lose a sexual functionality and he might
71:22 lose his life because this was super
71:24 muscle invasive cancer well he
71:28 questioned it found the world specialist
71:32 that's just mentioned this in episode I
71:33 even know if it's aired yet and he found
71:36 out he didn't have any and he was cured
71:41 imagine imagine you you were told you
71:43 have some major illness and I'm able to
71:46 prove to you that you don't have that
71:47 major illness and you never had that
71:49 major illness you're happy but do you
71:52 file malpractice against the folks that
71:54 told you that you did let me think about
71:58 the pain and suffering cases that we
72:00 have in the world where people are the
72:02 experience pain and suffering something
72:03 intellectual happens that they make a
72:07 million plus dollars off this lawsuit my
72:12 buddy never one after the other firm for
72:14 saying that he had it you got all those
72:16 crazy procedures done on him
72:19 it happens because we trust too much
72:23 sometimes so we get second opinions
72:27 because you really could be sick but go
72:31 in knowing that that's the case and also
72:32 the remedies it's time to investigate
72:35 other remedies what I find amazing is is
72:39 that I've I've you know again like I've
72:41 said in recent episodes last year of my
72:43 life but not of people saying they've
72:45 either got cancer and they're dying of
72:46 it or they have a pet that's dying of it
72:48 and then I will throw that them the
72:50 formulas that they need to investigate
72:52 and again you can take the solutions
72:55 that I have discovered online with the
72:59 case studies so I'm in documentaries on
73:01 Netflix okay
73:01 and like the Fukushima documentary about
73:05 how it turned into a a Gershom technique
73:07 clinic and I won't get a single reply
73:11 from these people
73:12 not a single reply from
73:15 individuals I mean [ __ ] if I was dying a
73:18 cancer man and someone came in to me and
73:20 said dude I know it's gonna sound a
73:22 little crazy but you know I love you and
73:24 I would do anything to hurt you and by
73:26 the way this stuff can't hurt you but
73:28 you might want to get on you know a
73:29 thousand milligrams of b-17 every single
73:31 day and by the way if you can get
73:32 injections of this stuff it works even
73:34 better go go go don't die I would reply
73:39 to you if I have a pet it's only eight
73:42 years old and it's dying and I love my
73:45 pet and I know it should live at least
73:46 another four - five - six - seven years
73:48 or whatever and you say hey just get me
73:50 17 injections in your pet don't reply
73:54 you don't reply you don't say anything
73:56 and you wanna well what I'm saying you
74:00 but some people want to argue that
74:01 people don't want to die sometimes they
74:03 don't want to get into these they
74:05 [ __ ] fall in love with the sympathy
74:07 pool that they develop when they have
74:09 something wrong going wrong in their
74:10 life
74:11 and these are people that are trying to
74:14 function in society when it comes to
74:16 picking politicians picking the way the
74:20 world works well Jesus Christ I don't
74:23 want any of these [ __ ] people running
74:24 the world because they're gonna want a
74:26 war they're gonna want our people to
74:28 suffer they're gonna love information
74:30 about a famine they're gonna love and
74:32 information about a plague that starts
74:34 in Los Angeles blamed on rats any bad
74:38 news man they love it because they don't
74:41 have an agenda of their own I think
74:44 that's why artists are the happiest
74:47 people on planet Earth
74:49 anything you do you draw you paint you
74:53 sculpt you know you can be an artist and
74:56 being a programmer at the same exact
74:58 time you sing you play an instrument
75:02 you're an artist you you dance you know
75:06 you're that weird guy in big lebowski
75:08 who does the whatever dance in style
75:10 that was those people are the happiest
75:13 people on planet Earth when they're in
75:14 their art they love it Michael Jackson
75:17 always said look if I could live onstage
75:18 I would because the second I come off I
75:20 got into this acidic world where
75:22 everyone's trying to steal my money and
75:23 Sue me and accuse me of all this crap
75:25 I'm not doing
75:28 so it's important that we all become
75:31 artists and man it doesn't make it you
75:34 could fold pantyhose with cotton balls
75:37 in them and make weird people that look
75:39 like Rosie O'Donnell didn't sell them
75:41 and you'll be happy do something man
75:44 maybe you just walk around the world and
75:47 take it in and you're sort of this you
75:49 know philosopher that's art that's the
75:52 art inside your mind my advice to you is
75:56 don't be a [ __ ] naysayer and we've
75:58 all slipped into those algorithms every
76:01 once in a while try to be constructive
76:03 if you find something wrong and if
76:05 you're struggling to find the thing that
76:07 to do as a alternative to the thing
76:10 that's going wrong then getting
76:11 conversations with it with people say
76:13 like you know I don't get it man
76:15 because we do this all atomic my smoke
76:17 lounge about the 17 movement we slip in
76:21 and out we have slipped in and out of it
76:23 believing in it not believing it we have
76:25 some people that believe it no matter
76:26 what and we have some people you know
76:29 like what I do is I voice my frustration
76:31 and I say look it's time you start
76:34 arresting people you've got plenty of
76:37 data on people it's time to start
76:38 arresting and if you ever wanted to make
76:40 the roaches scatter and the roaches talk
76:42 to each other so you could hear what
76:43 they're saying and hear their genesis
76:45 and catch them in deeper conspiracies
76:47 that's what you do you start arresting
76:49 the minions that work for them because
76:51 you got all their data and people come
76:53 to me and say you know and they are
76:54 arresting people yeah they are are they
76:56 arresting a bunch of pedophiles that's
76:58 good some people in Hollywood have had
76:59 issues but one of the guys in Hollywood
77:02 just paid his way out never see a day in
77:04 jail how's that guy learned his lesson
77:08 hope so hope you never gets himself in
77:11 that situation again they tend to you
77:15 know what do they call it R
77:16 acidification is that what it's called
77:18 in prison when you come back into prison
77:20 after you've been in it's easy to point
77:24 a finger at some gangbanger comes in and
77:26 out some meth addict that comes in and
77:29 out but that happens for all people
77:33 because it's a psychological reality of
77:35 how we deal with being in love with
77:37 something that's bad getting out of it
77:39 because you're forced to by society
77:41 and maybe you live clean for a little
77:43 while on but you're gonna you're gonna
77:45 say okay I was doing this thing and I
77:49 got caught so all I got to do is figure
77:52 out how not to get caught and then I can
77:54 keep doing that thing again
77:56 well I can't remember which which
77:59 beverage it was you're in those
78:01 commercials were the two old guys that
78:02 brilliant that's what goes on they
78:05 sitting there plush multi-million dollar
78:07 owns brilliant
78:09 was it Seagram's some I can't matter
78:12 what it was for some of us I want you to
78:15 think about the following this is what
78:17 I'll actually end with what if you read
78:22 a news article there for some reason
78:24 Bill Nye the douchebag guy never he
78:27 commits to never ever speaking in public
78:30 again never writing a book never writing
78:33 a paper never writing a blog he censors
78:35 himself or someone censors him from ever
78:39 spreading his deep State sellout agenda
78:43 how would you feel neil degrasse tyson
78:48 either does one of two things because he
78:51 actually has a PhD either he says the
78:54 same thing I'm never gonna talk in
78:56 public again because I finally realized
78:57 I don't know what the hell I'm talking
78:58 about
78:59 or he joins our little leather sofa
79:02 College and he's like you know what I
79:05 have been manipulated I in some cases
79:08 suspect that I was being manipulated but
79:10 the paycheck was so good I went with it
79:12 or I really did believe in these weird
79:14 things that I was saying and I realized
79:16 I don't have two neurons to rub together
79:20 with all that previous information so
79:22 what I'm going to do is recharter myself
79:24 to become a man of truth because he
79:27 feels his mortality and he acknowledges
79:29 perhaps a slightly different philosophy
79:32 than atheism but all those people in the
79:36 world that have that have been on the
79:38 wrong side of humanity they spread
79:41 disinformation they manufactured
79:42 disinformation Al Gore himself cuz you
79:45 know what I think maybe I was wrong
79:46 because he knows the CCX is never gonna
79:49 take off or maybe he just grows a bone
79:50 he sees Jesus in the desert or whatever
79:52 like Paul and he's like poof
79:55 I'm different how thrilled would you be
79:58 to read those deep state shells given up
80:02 the game and rededicating themselves to
80:05 society why mention that well I give
80:09 that fantasy scenario it's because you
80:15 know that you have a list of names in
80:17 your little scenario that are the people
80:20 that you don't believe the people that
80:22 lie to you 24/7 and the beautiful thing
80:26 is is that one you can now see the lies
80:28 because you've seen the truth or more
80:31 truth than lies right we're trying to
80:33 figure out some things and we don't have
80:35 all the evidence at how they faked this
80:36 or did that or whatever but we're trying
80:42 imagine every little kid that's born if
80:45 they can get born in this country and
80:50 protecting them from the medicines that
80:53 are being injected into their bodies to
80:54 rot their brains and rot their genetics
80:57 all the food that keeps them stunted
81:00 from growing because when you eat fast
81:03 food it's not nutrition it's just
81:05 something to fill your belly and make
81:07 you feel like you've eaten something but
81:09 it's not good for you
81:11 then you protect them from that you make
81:13 them eat good food non-gmo food you keep
81:17 the vaccinations away if you got to move
81:19 your kid out of a town that's gonna
81:21 force it on your kids and that's what
81:23 you do I know that's a horrific thing to
81:25 have to do but you do it because you
81:28 know it's it's again I keep this analogy
81:31 I just did it to a friend of mine and
81:32 she laughed her ass off today if I again
81:37 make you the best non-gmo fruit drink
81:42 you know put some kale in there for you
81:44 if you like to have a little bit of hemp
81:46 and your taste buds but I put this great
81:49 thing together and I mix it all right in
81:51 front of you we even go to the store
81:53 together go to market together where
81:54 it's been picked out of the ground but
81:56 prove everything is healthy but the last
81:58 second I get the syringe and I stick it
82:03 in a Drano bottle I pull out some for
82:06 those I don't hope that's called that in
82:08 Europe but it's the stuff that
82:09 your dreams right and yet I squirted
82:12 into this otherwise perfectly healthy
82:15 drink and I pushed it to you go Kate
82:17 drink it and you're like no well why not
82:21 you just put [ __ ] poison in it okay
82:26 so why won't you drink it it's I'm gonna
82:28 kill you
82:29 you know it's diluted enough it's not
82:30 gonna rot your gut too bad you'll heal
82:33 you'll feel a little sick but you'll be
82:35 you'll be young you won't die from it
82:36 you can tell your friends you drink
82:37 Drano once you're like [ __ ] no I'm not
82:40 gonna drink that then I say good the why
82:45 the hell you feeling yourself full of a
82:47 vaccination why the hell are you eating
82:49 GMO foods why the hell are you drinking
82:52 and brushing with fluoride on and on and
82:56 on why you using microwaves why you
82:57 drinking aspartame and you know well
82:59 every [ __ ] drug is sugar substitute
83:01 on planet earth why are you eating
83:03 margarine instead of butter why are you
83:05 putting aluminium inside the pores of
83:08 your armpits to keep yourself from
83:10 sweating when that's what they're made
83:12 to do is release toxins why why why why
83:17 why
83:18 if you refuse to drink Drano then refuse
83:21 all this other crap and by the way use
83:25 that little analogy with your friends
83:27 you will have the most amazing responses
83:30 out of their faces I mean because they
83:31 can't deny it they're going to side with
83:34 not drinking it's and then you're gonna
83:36 be able to punch the joke or punch the
83:38 example with the other things that they
83:39 consume as I said a long time ago I'm
83:45 sorry that all of this bad stuff is
83:48 happening or is being realized on your
83:50 watch that you really can't just wake up
83:54 in the morning and breathe a huge deep
83:57 breath of I don't need to do [ __ ] all
83:59 with my life I don't do anything with my
84:01 life I can just ignore everything and
84:03 live my life I'm sorry that that's not
84:06 truly possible you may choose to do that
84:09 and again you can't fight every single
84:10 day of your life so I understand I
84:12 always tell you guys take breaks from
84:13 this stuff get in fight the good fight
84:15 get out give yourself a break
84:17 understand that there's plenty of us
84:19 grabbing the baton after you've had to
84:21 drop it because you can only run
84:22 one loop around the track and you need
84:24 to pass the baton to someone who's gonna
84:26 run it again
84:27 set your excetra right I'm going to get
84:32 the episode out about having skin in the
84:34 game before this episode comes out
84:36 there's a lot to do there's probably
84:39 more for us to do in our lifetimes even
84:42 if you're young but you'll start to see
84:44 the benefits of the world right away and
84:47 again you know no matter how intelligent
84:50 you are you know that if we could get
84:54 everybody on the same page of saying if
84:56 is is it bad for you let's stop doing it
84:58 okay the world would curse self correct
85:02 so quickly it would boggle your mind you
85:06 wouldn't recognize the planet Earth in
85:07 ten years if we could just get everybody
85:10 on the same page but just know your deep
85:14 state shells are trying to stop that
85:16 from happening and you're naysayers are
85:19 inadvertently stopping it from happening
85:22 all your true believers in sovereignty
85:26 your true believers and do no harm are
85:29 going to be effective for the world be
85:32 one of those people the seventeen
85:36 movement is an idea it doesn't matter if
85:39 it's fake it's telling you to think it's
85:42 telling you to discern information it
85:44 still it's teaching you to pick the
85:46 better side of morality is teaching you
85:48 to pick the better side about a managed
85:49 humanity do we have primitive groups out
85:55 there absolutely education is the only
85:58 thing we can do to resolve this
85:59 non-violently we have to educate
86:03 ourselves to treat them better we have
86:05 to educate them to not want to harm us
86:07 teach them that you know you should
86:10 fight for your country no matter what it
86:11 takes because you can't invade everybody
86:14 else's country with the philosophy of
86:16 being a [ __ ] you can't you're going to
86:19 this country that you really like him
86:20 because you're a [ __ ] the second that
86:22 all the Turan tyranny shows up you're
86:24 like oh I got it I got to go to another
86:26 country and destroy that country because
86:29 I'll never fight for anything anyway I
86:32 know you feel me largely preaching to
86:36 the
86:36 I'm sure if you have been to deep
86:39 thoughts radio.com please go it's got an
86:41 all-new navigation across the top it'll
86:44 give you some options to find this on
86:46 video options to find this on audio
86:49 because you want to switch feeds there
86:51 are a couple social media outlets one is
86:53 the locked Facebook group the other one
86:55 is the Twitter account there's
86:57 discussion in the Facebook there's not
87:00 much discussion on the Twitter side of
87:02 things there are two ways to donate to
87:06 the show there is patreon and there is
87:09 PayPal there's also again I'm just gonna
87:13 say this for now hopefully this piece of
87:15 software continues to exist it's called
87:16 the brave browser I've been using it
87:20 like crazy and all my devices and again
87:21 I have never been more happy in my life
87:23 watching it remove all the tracking data
87:27 so the big machine data gathering on
87:30 your life is indeed with brave it's
87:32 fantastic they can still punch your IP
87:35 here and there and figure out a little
87:38 bit about you but boy you will have you
87:40 will have turned off 80% of the tracking
87:42 if not more so get yourself the brave
87:45 browser for now if brave goes out of
87:47 business and you see this video a long
87:49 time from now there's gonna be other
87:52 options so just make sure you find a
87:54 browser that's blocking the tracking
87:56 mainly but it'll also block ads it'll
87:59 block autoplay videos it's nice and it
88:02 knows they'll let YouTube play and that
88:04 kind of stuff but in terms of like Fox
88:05 shoving some ad down your throats you
88:08 don't want to hear where they're gonna
88:09 scoop some money off of one of their
88:10 sponsors neutralize it make it all
88:15 impression based profit that we're
88:19 listening to them because they're
88:20 telling us the truth which is gonna be
88:22 tough but anyway there's the all-new
88:25 season 1 remastered I'm almost done with
88:29 it I'm at 80 today it's probably gonna
88:32 take another couple weeks to get the
88:33 other twenty finished I'm putting
88:35 everything on bit shoot com putting
88:37 everything on bright tee on bright downs
88:39 got an issue where you have to view it a
88:40 lot but hopefully in June they lift that
88:42 limit because I'm only I'm limited to 10
88:45 videos
88:46 and their software is so primitive at
88:50 this point I got 10 videos up there and
88:51 I got this warning saying you've
88:54 exceeded your limits you can only have
88:55 10 videos and I'm like why only have 10
88:58 video so why the hell am i seeing this
88:59 huge we're gonna race your [ __ ] in the
89:02 middle of the night warning you know
89:04 anyway but they said they're trying to
89:05 remove all that limitations so it's just
89:07 a matter of hosting costs I sympathize
89:09 with them but my previous speculation
89:13 about them has been largely corrected
89:15 but we have to keep a vigilant eye
89:18 anyway till the next episode take care
89:21 of yourself and someone else and I'll
89:22 see in the next deep thoughts over now
