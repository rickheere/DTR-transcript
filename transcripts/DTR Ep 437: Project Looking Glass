00:30 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:32 gentlemen long time ago probably four
00:35 years ago maybe even in my MK ULTRA
00:37 radio show with Kyle I coined a phrase I
00:42 was trying to think of a nifty little
00:44 acronym for Google and when I came up
00:49 with it was government owned and
00:51 operated global Looking Glass of the
00:55 elite and now serendipitously the
01:02 apparently the number 17 guy has got
01:07 everyone looking off on this project
01:10 Looking Glass now we're gonna look at
01:15 what's being insinuated because I heard
01:19 a friend of mine just marvel over this
01:23 Looking Glass project has never really
01:25 looked into it definitely didn't do any
01:27 rapid hauling of the individual
01:30 technologies that this dude in this
01:32 video I'm not gonna mention anybody by
01:36 name so everyone could just wonder if
01:38 I'm talking about them and so it was
01:41 like oh my god you need to hear about
01:42 Project lookin'-glass I'm like no I mean
01:44 I kind of did but didn't you know
01:46 Christus acronym I came up with a long
01:48 time ago was all sudden ringing in my
01:50 brain which is me making up something
01:53 out of thin air to be funny so I go up
01:57 and watch this video and I'm sitting
01:59 there looking at this thing going really
02:02 that's what it is
02:04 after I finally looked at the deep dive
02:06 on it I was interestingly shocked that
02:13 people are taking this seriously
02:16 now I'm always telling you guys to have
02:18 open mind so I have done episodes on
02:23 individual issues in fact I have one
02:27 that's not published at this moment in
02:29 time that's going to also feed into this
02:31 but it's based off me watching a
02:32 fictional show on TV and then sort of
02:35 tossing it around
02:36 all right so what's this about for those
02:38 of you don't know so our 17 guy which if
02:43 you don't know what that is just count
02:44 the letters in the alphabet look up that
02:48 letter plus project you buy just look up
02:51 project looking-glass and you'll see all
02:55 kinds of videos it's a big exploding
02:56 thing on the Internet
02:57 I want to throw my two cents in not the
03:00 harvest views but to make sure we all
03:02 take a step back just a little bit here
03:03 and you know if anything it's good
03:06 entertainment all right good you know
03:09 I'm all it for and for entertainment you
03:11 know but what this is is a bunch of
03:15 dried up coast to coast am fictional
03:21 projects that are being rehashed all put
03:26 into one container called the project
03:31 Looking Glass now there could be my
03:33 opinion of what this is could be more
03:36 realistic and true and maybe what the 17
03:38 dude is referring if 17 guys blowing
03:41 smoke which is a lot of reasons why you
03:45 shouldn't think that and some reason is
03:46 the way you're gonna go come on
03:47 Lundy to say something new make
03:50 something happen it looks like some
03:51 things are happening so it's good we all
03:53 want that dude to be real because if
03:55 he's not real it's a bummer and if he is
03:57 real oh my god stand back cuz some cool
04:00 shits about to happen right but the
04:04 video I saw and bless the guy's hard who
04:06 was making the video I just picked one
04:09 50 minute video a little bit more net he
04:14 talked about how excited he was to talk
04:16 about this and he starts cutting stuff
04:18 together he does a great job you know
04:21 cutting in the people that are claiming
04:23 to be a part of this project but here's
04:27 the thing yours truly gets paid to make
04:30 up stories okay I've been paid to make
04:34 up stories since the late 80s when I was
04:37 in the video game business and I did it
04:39 for 10 years almost eight years as a
04:43 child making a video games watching
04:45 every awesome science-fiction show
04:49 in every twilight zone and I like the
04:51 back of my hand not just the overall
04:55 what happened in the twilight zone but
04:57 the story arcs the characters in a lot
05:00 of cases who exactly wrote it whether
05:01 it's Charles Beaumont Rod Serling Earl
05:04 hammer I'm there got it really good my
05:09 photographic memory is all history I see
05:11 history and photographic layers right so
05:13 the history of science a particular
05:15 strand of science everything that I have
05:17 personally learned which is obviously
05:19 got holes in it it's limited in certain
05:22 areas and I just do layers back and so
05:25 when I need to connect dots you know for
05:29 me it's what I call like a dangerous
05:30 mind you know it's not not the autistic
05:34 dangerous mind but well maybe it is like
05:38 if I know but I'll tell you what I think
05:41 it is first what's really strange to me
05:45 is that there's projects out there that
05:46 have been around since the late 70s and
05:49 even before that spy on people our
05:53 government our intelligence agencies
05:55 spying on other agencies and in several
05:59 cases we sold the computers then ended
06:03 up being the spy computer so we would
06:05 sell like the Canadian Mounties got had
06:07 by our intelligence agencies because
06:09 they were sold a really Chapman they
06:13 were sold a bunch of computers that we
06:15 said hey these are awesome use them in
06:16 your intelligence gathering it for the
06:18 Mounties and they're awesome the
06:21 software is great they're like yeah
06:23 great now we're as sophisticated as the
06:25 United States not realizing that we
06:27 embedded keyboard readers that have many
06:30 transmitters in them so all we had to do
06:32 is put a little receiver outside their
06:33 police station's their intelligence
06:34 buildings and we could look at
06:36 everything the Mounties were doing this
06:40 has gone through several stages I think
06:42 one of the first ones I was ever taught
06:43 about was project Escalon there have
06:47 been father-son teams that were murdered
06:49 who helped invent this stuff because
06:51 they had money one to know that it
06:52 existed couldn't trust them because
06:54 they're so so evil they know that
06:58 anybody with the moral fiber is going to
06:59 eventually reject the objective of what
07:02 they're
07:03 software was used for you know
07:05 regardless of what they promised them
07:06 initially I'm gonna guess that looking
07:11 last that the 17 dude is referring to is
07:13 a spy software network and not a what
07:21 we're about to talk about so the project
07:27 Looking Glass is really two major themes
07:30 of scientific research with claims of
07:34 successes I have made several episodes
07:37 about time I've made a couple episodes
07:41 about dimensional possible dimensional
07:45 realities because it's all subjective
07:46 what you call dimension and then there
07:51 is remote viewing which when I took a
07:55 deep dive was very interesting but you
07:58 have to also know that governments do
08:00 psyops against other governments imagine
08:04 for instance no government has
08:07 discovered a UFO and then Roswell 47
08:10 happens they publish it as a PSYOP
08:13 against Russia
08:14 now again you do your deep dives on this
08:17 if it is a fake that my god they did
08:20 some serious and Carol just stuff to
08:22 people in the late 40s which I have my
08:23 doubts but what if you were like the
08:28 competitive country to the United States
08:29 of America after the World War two here
08:33 we have spent literally billions
08:35 increasing our naval fleet technology
08:38 our aeronautical technology our spy
08:40 technology our mental manipulation we
08:42 got you know 1200 to 1700 Nazis out of
08:48 Germany and smuggled them in the United
08:49 States thanks to the Dulles brothers big
08:52 portion went off to do mind-control the
08:54 other portion went off to do NASA they
08:58 did fund remote viewing
09:01 remote viewing was the SIOP most likely
09:04 from russia to us claiming the given
09:08 just GPS coordinates the human being
09:10 could sit and meditate and see what's at
09:14 that GPS location
09:16 including interstellar GPS coordinates
09:21 to say you're gonna look into Mars
09:23 you're gonna look into the planet xenon
09:25 or whatever it is claiming obviously
09:29 massive amounts of success however
09:34 there's a big catch remember that old
09:37 saying outrageous claims require
09:39 outrageous evidence okay if I told you
09:45 that I had the ability this is a
09:49 fictitious claim but I want you to think
09:51 about this first split second this is
09:53 where it starts to become the Occam's
09:54 razor razor against these outrageous
09:57 claims because someone could just poopoo
10:01 it away oh well then I can show us
10:02 evidence because that's the secret
10:03 weapon okay whatever whatever you got to
10:06 do to believe in Jesus okay if I said I
10:10 have the capability of lifting infinite
10:12 mass I am an invincible Hulk I look like
10:18 this but I can pick up anything in the
10:21 world as long as it can stay together
10:22 while being picked up if that World
10:25 Trade Center can stay together I could
10:26 take my finger put it on the bottom of
10:29 the foundation lift the whole building
10:30 up with my finger I make this claim it's
10:34 like burgess Meredith being the strong
10:36 man in Twilight Zone all right but then
10:40 I do some construction on my house I
10:42 want to put a wing back here instead of
10:44 this yard I want to build three or four
10:45 stories up there I go to another
10:48 location and I'm moving big heavy things
10:52 but I'm paying outside firms to bring in
10:58 cranes to lift everything that I need to
11:02 move around and get this construction
11:04 done but one of you finally walks up to
11:06 me and says wait a minute aren't you the
11:09 guy that said you could lift infinite
11:10 weight yeah yeah so why are you paying
11:13 tens of thousands of dollars if not
11:15 millions of dollars for these cranes to
11:16 show up to lift all this stuff for you
11:19 when you can just do it yourself
11:22 right and now I'm a fraud well lift
11:26 something in front of me
11:27 well I can't lift it in front of you
11:28 it's a secret weapon I
11:29 hidden resource for the US military blah
11:33 blah blah right okay I have a very good
11:38 friend of mine who's extremely
11:39 intelligent and she has continually said
11:41 no matter how intense the proofs are and
11:47 she doesn't necessarily deny the proofs
11:49 of the 17:00 dude she just simply says
11:52 yeah those proofs are real but you're
11:55 being set up and then of course I kind
11:58 of think I know what she's gonna say but
12:00 she's an extremely burning articulate
12:01 person so I say tell me what do you
12:03 think she goes you're gonna get hat she
12:06 goes this is going to bubble up to the
12:11 point where perhaps the swamp gets
12:13 drained some of the swamp may actually
12:15 help getting drained people meaning
12:18 people you think are your enemy are
12:19 actually in on it and then America will
12:23 have a one-party country which again
12:26 some of us in an ideal situation would
12:28 enjoy as long as it's more central non
12:31 left non right constitutional based
12:33 common-law Magna Carta government we
12:37 could probably deal with that but then
12:39 that puts a set of liability of that
12:40 turning over to something else but she
12:44 goes are getting way to the sweet spot
12:46 when it all seems like it's going right
12:48 and then the bull shits gonna drop I
12:52 said what do you mean this is you know
12:55 I'm paraphrasing her but she said
12:57 essentially look they're gonna start
13:00 selling you something that is untrue and
13:03 you're gonna buy it
13:05 because you think this source is so
13:08 legit and because they've orchestrated
13:11 legitimate things because they are up to
13:14 a point very legitimate 17 guys says
13:17 he's deep inside the government
13:18 intelligence of one of the alphabet
13:20 agencies we can actually I think trust
13:22 I think definitely have FISA warrants
13:25 that they have to go through to spy on
13:26 you instead of just looking in the
13:28 database which is Snowden's game I think
13:33 Snowden's a traitor because he's on the
13:36 deep state side without he realizes it
13:38 or not and he is trying to destroy
13:42 an agency I think that is fighting that
13:45 organization he believes everything he
13:48 stole because he's that kind of guy up
13:50 to a level he's revealing this and that
13:53 and he's not totally incorrect or
13:55 anything but he's not realizing what
13:56 team he's playing him but anyway
13:58 remote viewing well what's the gist of
14:02 remote viewing well I heard about it 20
14:06 plus years ago before the internet was
14:09 really hot and it was all about the idea
14:11 that let's say that you had a very
14:14 top-secret document and it was in an
14:16 envelope or a briefcase that had
14:18 something very important in launch codes
14:21 some encrypted information or not
14:24 encrypt information and some being
14:26 simply guarded by the vessel that's
14:28 being transported or stored in that a
14:31 remote viewing person could have the GPS
14:34 coordinates of that object or just think
14:36 about the object in general it can tell
14:40 you what's in it and this is supposedly
14:43 real which means you essentially have
14:46 spine capabilities real-time anywhere in
14:49 the world and there's nothing you can do
14:51 about it all right
14:54 well how would one prove this from one
14:57 country to the other well it could be
15:01 legit and this works which would imply a
15:05 whole different reality that we're in
15:07 right now or it could be I'm making this
15:12 up but say the KGB calls the CIA and
15:15 says look we got remote viewing it's a
15:17 hundred percent you don't believe us put
15:21 a briefcase somewhere with something in
15:23 it it's something unimportant but just
15:25 pick four random digits put a picture in
15:27 there whatever give us a fax number give
15:32 us 30 minutes and we'll fax you what's
15:34 inside that briefcase lo and behold the
15:37 fax comes in and it's if it's a carbon
15:40 copy what's in that suitcase and all of
15:42 a sudden the US military is like oh [ __ ]
15:46 we're going to figure out another way to
15:48 store information such that even remote
15:50 viewing can't figure it out perhaps
15:52 nothing's ever written down it's
15:54 encrypted in the computers that's just
15:55 never
15:56 visible it's stored in a crazy metrics
15:58 that even if you could kind of see part
16:00 of it it's still a project nygma code
16:02 you don't have the decoder ring so they
16:04 figure out a way to off you skate that
16:06 right alright what's the other way it
16:09 could happen what if David Blaine was
16:10 doing it master magician never really
16:14 does anything that he says he does he
16:15 always has a trick up his sleeve
16:17 he's entertainer he's got that license
16:19 we support him we like him but whoever's
16:24 in the room when the piece of paper
16:26 shoved into the briefcase has 30 minutes
16:29 to exit the room 30 minutes to transmit
16:32 without exiting the room the information
16:36 to the other side through some covert
16:38 communication which could be extremely
16:41 elaborate 50 people no pigeon who knows
16:46 right someone gets the pigeon pulls the
16:49 note off calls the Kremlin that's four
16:53 or five nine six nine nine nine okay
16:55 they fax it over oh my god looks like we
16:58 have magic capabilities in Russia that's
17:01 another way that that trick could go
17:02 down to prove one government to another
17:04 now there's a lot of us that think that
17:06 these governments have only been against
17:09 each other and some faux war to keep
17:13 control over their people that none of
17:15 this cold war was actually ever real
17:18 it's just a method to stay in power I
17:20 guess a lot of validity behind that but
17:24 now Looking Glass adds another dimension
17:25 to it because there again mashing old
17:28 theories together but now here's my
17:31 impression of a video I saw the guy in
17:34 khaki pants I think and he was like a
17:37 light blue shirt but he's walking around
17:40 giving us some speech about this
17:43 claiming to be deep in the project and
17:47 just talking about it matter-of-factly
17:50 right we've had a lot of these guys over
17:53 the years and they're good up to a point
17:55 and I've talked about him several times
17:57 when's the last time your son or
18:00 daughter under 10 years old told you an
18:03 elaborate lie and you just looked at
18:06 them and totally believed it
18:08 probably very rare in your past right
18:12 because there's indicators that if
18:14 someone's telling a line a child can't
18:15 quite hide it all you know then the
18:20 confidence trickster the con man gets
18:22 older gets better more well rehearsed
18:25 there's ill movies six degrees of
18:26 separation with Will Ferrell or no sorry
18:29 excuse me Will Smith who practiced this
18:33 script is monologue about being Sidney
18:37 Poitier's son who's in town and he's
18:40 going to be offering this family this
18:42 close proximity to Sidney and it's all a
18:45 lie the way that he got that lie so well
18:48 rehearsed this is also in the reservoir
18:52 dogs by Tarantino where Tim Roth had to
18:56 rehearse this story about going to the
18:58 bathroom with a bunch of coke and a bag
19:00 finds cops in the bathroom with a
19:02 sniffing dog and he didn't get caught
19:04 and he had to rehearse this rehearse
19:06 this to tell the baat mob boss the story
19:09 with all his minions in such a way that
19:11 they thought he was legit same thing
19:15 Will Smith did in six degrees of
19:16 separation all right so I've could
19:21 criticize cuz I've listened to coast to
19:23 coast am from time to time but again
19:26 that's an entertainment show so I'm not
19:28 really criticizing coast to coast and
19:30 I'm not trying to kiss up to them but
19:31 there's a distinction in my mind to the
19:35 degree that any particular show misleads
19:37 the public and saying something is true
19:40 when it's false you know I don't know
19:43 who's going to coast to coast to get
19:44 their science but you're operating at
19:47 your own risk right but the psyops that
19:50 go in there and train they have
19:53 rehearsed their little story up to a
19:56 point they have tried to think of every
19:58 contingency question every question that
20:00 could be asked about their story more
20:03 dimensions to it right I give an example
20:06 there was a gentleman on the show jeez
20:09 15 years ago he said that he was in this
20:13 program with Barack Obama with a few
20:16 other guys one of the guys called up
20:17 during the show and said stop mentioning
20:18 my name I got nothing to do with you I'm
20:21 this kind of stuff guys old and what's
20:24 the guy's a little contingency phrase to
20:26 get out of that accusation that he's
20:27 lying well you you actually haven't done
20:30 it yet implying some time travel
20:34 situation where this guy who's retired
20:36 not in any active program is going to
20:39 get back into the program and travel
20:40 around the universe with the sky yeah
20:43 nice right again it's great
20:47 entertainment let's just leave it at
20:49 that
20:50 now the sudden entertainment is fact in
20:53 this project Looking Glass thing but he
20:56 said he went to this other planet and I
20:58 forgot which one it was but he talked
21:00 about hanging out with them and then
21:03 coming back wearing this like exchange
21:04 program which is right out of the movie
21:06 Close Encounters of the Third Kind we're
21:08 sure Dreyfuss gets in the red jumpsuit
21:10 with a bunch of other guys in red
21:11 jumpsuits with their silver briefcases
21:12 and house on the freakin vehicle and
21:15 leaves implying an exchange program
21:18 between the two of us obviously at some
21:21 point if we're a peaceful relationship
21:23 we're gonna explore their world and come
21:25 back and report back in so this guy is
21:28 basically claiming to be one of those
21:29 dudes right so George Noory
21:33 god bless him he goes okay well tell us
21:38 what you saw what do they look like what
21:40 does their city look like what does
21:42 their world look like oh man that's a
21:45 lot of details in it uh he goes it looks
21:51 just like our world he couldn't give one
21:54 detail that was miraculous not one thing
21:58 that was he didn't even say like
22:00 anti-gravity cars or anything like that
22:03 he just could cope with anything he
22:04 wasn't prepared but his big elaborate
22:07 story sounded good as the set up the act
22:09 one of his movie but he didn't have any
22:10 other acts written and of course to make
22:14 the sound legit he said Barack Obama
22:17 with it went with him to make it
22:18 interesting or and he's like give me a
22:20 break so I must have been around
22:22 2008-2009 where have we seen this as
22:25 well before that moment I mentioned this
22:29 two or three times it's very important
22:30 to remember this you can go look this up
22:33 dr. Steven Greer who started the project
22:39 was a project disclosure where he had a
22:43 press conference in the early 21st
22:46 century where he allowed people to go up
22:49 to a podium and give their testimony of
22:53 sightings UFO sightings UFO encounters
22:56 as military officials and either that
22:59 our intelligence officials and then they
23:02 said I'm willing to testify in a court a
23:03 lot this is true and a bunch of guys did
23:06 that and there's a whole press
23:08 international presser there it's a
23:10 pretty interesting event but one dude
23:12 sitting on the end of the table was more
23:14 senior old guy and he says well he needs
23:19 the up stage right this is all big
23:20 attention game thing right so it's a big
23:22 contest a big pissing match the truth
23:24 not just truth truth but a pissing match
23:27 truth and the guy says well I personally
23:29 know of 27 species that are already on
23:33 earth some of them still he supplied
23:36 that a bunch of them live here and this
23:39 this journalist a real journalist stood
23:43 up you had a British accent but he goes
23:45 well can you tell us what it looked like
23:48 what they look like you saw a glass on
23:52 this guy's eyes he got glaucoma in two
23:53 seconds straight he's a a they look like
23:57 us same lame-ass answer that a guy
24:01 coast-to-coast gave fever that years
24:03 later well of course that's easy it
24:06 looked like us look like Elon Musk's
24:09 ex-wife right who was in West world
24:11 because her eyes are a little bit
24:13 further apart with her tribe in Europe
24:18 so will he have seen this stuff for
24:21 years right so when I watched this guy
24:25 give his little presentation on the
24:30 project looking glass or operation
24:32 looking glass to camera exactly what
24:34 they call it I'll find it out he is
24:37 giving you sort of a I mean for any of
24:42 you were in science fiction
24:43 one of the most lowbrow
24:46 definitions of space-time I've ever
24:50 heard of my life and good time and space
24:53 be that basic well yeah I mean I think
24:56 everybody imagines its X Y Z T you
25:00 program a video game and tell me you're
25:02 not operating in the X Y Z TD you know
25:05 being world coordinate it's just what we
25:08 do you know you want to transform
25:09 something over time to animate something
25:11 well it's in a certain space and time
25:13 and it's supposed to transform the 3d
25:15 mesh and rotate it and animate the bones
25:17 and you know according to the rigging
25:19 and all that stuff it's just basic stuff
25:21 right but if you never have any exposure
25:24 that kind of stuff boy it's science
25:25 fiction
25:26 in fact it's science fact so there's
25:30 been this funny little story about Baron
25:33 Trump because there's a series of books
25:36 written in 1800 s about The Adventures
25:38 of Baron Trump
25:39 well Trump's youngest son which I
25:42 believe is his third son his name baron
25:44 cute kid and ironically in this book the
25:48 little boy looks it's he's drawn very
25:52 minimalistic Lee very very few lines to
25:55 draw the face I'm a face expert when it
25:56 comes to illustration and painting and
25:58 so this kid is it's very minimalistic it
26:02 could be a bunch of different kids but
26:03 it does kind of look like Baron Trump
26:05 now the other interesting thing is he
26:08 has a little companion that goes with
26:10 him named the Donald Wilde right so we
26:14 had this fun little tongue-in-cheek
26:18 conspiracy the flew around the web that
26:20 Trump is a time traveler because his
26:22 uncle seized Tesla's patents at his
26:25 house and supposedly it was fully
26:29 operational time travel technology the
26:32 Tesla just maiden but off to the side
26:35 never used it you know
26:38 and Tesla ends up getting hit by a car
26:40 which leads to his death so again a
26:43 psychic to can't tell what's going to
26:45 happen to him never looked five minutes
26:46 in his future whatever mm-hmm whatever
26:50 so what they've done is they've taken
26:51 remote viewing and they've blended it
26:54 with time-travel to insinuate and
26:58 suggest quite literally
27:00 that the people that are in this project
27:01 have the capability of turning on a
27:03 machine creating a portal a black pour
27:07 on the in the room that is the other
27:11 universe straight out of some TV series
27:14 and that you know they they accidentally
27:18 did it and then also they massaged it
27:20 now they can not only create that portal
27:23 but lo and behold as a lowbrow science
27:27 fiction plot move that portal anywhere
27:30 move the what you're seeing through the
27:31 hole in any Cartesian coordinate system
27:34 XYZ meaning a space in our space but
27:37 also T in time but you're gonna have to
27:41 figure out where you're looking
27:43 regardless of again if we're in a ball
27:45 or a disk or whatever
27:47 nothing prohibits that object that we
27:51 live on sorry someone's pulling
27:54 doughnuts wait for them to crash but
27:56 nothing prohibits them that where we are
27:58 from traveling through space time again
28:01 time being an extremely relative thing
28:04 created by the memory of the passage of
28:06 change but they're they're looking back
28:09 in time and looking forward in time what
28:13 they're trying to do
28:14 what these people are trying to do to
28:15 the seventeen movement and again I'm not
28:17 convinced the seventeen dude is trying
28:18 to do this and if the seventeen dude
28:20 ever listens to this through shared it
28:22 sure serendipity
28:25 I would advise to get off this really
28:27 quickly because you're gonna screw
28:28 yourself up but that the military in the
28:31 United States of America those that are
28:33 supporting our president they are
28:36 looking all over reality and finding out
28:39 what everyone's going to do in the
28:41 future where they've done in the past
28:42 and that that's the way that they're
28:43 framing everybody with their own past I
28:46 mean really using what they've really
28:47 done not making things up win if you
28:51 study project Escalon for the late 70s
28:53 up and every iteration of our
28:55 intelligence-gathering apparatus
28:57 apparatus we have known anything that we
29:03 want to know at any point in time is a
29:04 little more difficult in the past right
29:06 so maybe 1985 you have some Apple
29:11 Merrimac to
29:13 you might have like a Mack 512k unit you
29:16 might have an apple - maybe you have
29:18 Windows 1.0 das whatever okay so they
29:23 want to know what you have on your
29:24 computer there's some people who have
29:26 modems most people don't and even if you
29:28 do have a modem you're probably not
29:30 transferring your sensitive
29:31 documentation over that plus you can't
29:34 just walk into someone's computer when
29:36 they're using their modem because it had
29:37 such bad bandwidth you would immediately
29:39 just lock up the computer because they'd
29:42 be using all the bandwidth and you
29:43 wouldn't have any left so back in the
29:45 day if they really thought you had
29:47 something that they wanted they put
29:49 people on the ground outside your house
29:51 they simply watched when you go to work
29:52 when you come home and watch it for a
29:54 little while maybe in that time they
29:56 still knew how to look in your credit
29:57 card transactions your ATM transactions
30:00 anything that puts you at a particular
30:01 location outside your home and they will
30:04 put people in your house in two seconds
30:06 that will then install things on your
30:08 computer little transmitters that will
30:10 monitor your keyboard input they could
30:14 get your password but they don't really
30:16 need to because they're watching you
30:17 type everything live so okay whatever
30:19 they need to walk in and type in your
30:21 password they can do it but they can do
30:24 all kinds of little micro transmitters
30:25 receivers and get everything off your
30:27 computer they know how to do it it's
30:29 just nobody did it back in the day in
30:31 the public sector and the public sector
30:35 because it it was just unnecessary so we
30:39 don't need time travel all right to know
30:42 what's on every single computer to know
30:44 every single packet of information it's
30:46 ever traveled over the Internet
30:48 from the get-go all right you have CERN
30:52 and and DARPA in really pioneering the
30:57 HTTP protocol very well knowing from the
31:01 very beginning these people are
31:03 ridiculous
31:04 geniuses that of Dartmouth Dartmouth
31:07 excuse me University out of MIT out of
31:10 Caltech out of a bunch of think-tank so
31:11 that we don't even know their names
31:13 they thought all this the stuff through
31:15 before a single webpage was ever erected
31:17 and given to the public as a protocol
31:20 with the what was it the netscape
31:22 browser back in the day all the netscape
31:26 browser
31:27 do was just hand off an extra
31:28 transmission to a back-end unbeknownst
31:31 to you and they'd know where you went if
31:34 they're gonna serve up the page and give
31:35 it to you well that server just goes
31:38 through a massive router somewhere and
31:40 that router gives a duplicate off to the
31:41 intelligence agencies in boom we know
31:44 everything you've ever done the more
31:46 sophisticated the more thorough the
31:48 Internet has become remember all the
31:50 massive OS upgrades to the Macintosh
31:53 have all been your notifications it's
31:56 all social media crap what that should
31:59 translate to you is spy software that's
32:02 all it is because the Mac got busy using
32:06 the next operating system by 2001 it
32:10 just became this huge harvesting thing
32:12 spotlight showed up and indexed your
32:14 hard drive so they could find any file
32:16 on your hard drive anything two seconds
32:21 they could my Apple also turned on face
32:24 recognition on photos or iPhoto I
32:26 couldn't turn it off it's looking at all
32:29 your photos making a binary tree of all
32:32 the dates and times GPS everything also
32:36 face scraping so they're looking for
32:39 someone that's a dissident someone who
32:40 was at the Boston bombing and saw
32:42 something a little funny and so they
32:45 just used that face of facial
32:47 recognition from a surveillance camera
32:49 from other cameras you don't know that
32:51 exists that were installed for that day
32:53 to harvest everybody involved if they
32:55 suspect you they just put the blip out
32:58 over the internet goes right into
33:01 everybody's computer and searches that
33:02 binary tree and in a millisecond they
33:06 have exactly where that person is last
33:08 time they showed up at Disneyland
33:10 somewhere someone someone they don't
33:12 even know took their picture and it's in
33:14 that computer and because they're like
33:16 yeah I want to give all my diagnostic
33:17 data to the computer companies right to
33:20 make Microsoft Office perform better
33:22 right but the Mac got amazing and then
33:26 what happens the windows starts getting
33:28 pained when this gets paying because
33:30 they're behind the curve and so I was in
33:35 the Bay Area just to give you an example
33:37 in 1997-98 and they were caught
33:40 selling keys to the NSA right inside
33:44 your operating system you know when you
33:45 used to install windows used to see that
33:47 little dose readout in the lower
33:49 left-hand corner it was all the millions
33:51 of files that are getting installed on
33:52 your computer
33:53 well the hacks the hackers of the Bay
33:57 Area who believed in liberty and freedom
33:59 slowed it down filmed it and watched oh
34:02 my god there's a Keith there's a key
34:04 Microsoft denies it publicly publicly
34:07 after being accused I think through the
34:08 San Francisco Chronicle and then later
34:11 within a month I admitted it was a key
34:14 to allow them to look inside your
34:16 computer that's when they were on top
34:18 windows over Mac Mac didn't have all
34:21 that in the 90s I used to work with Los
34:23 Alamos labs and a double-blinded Support
34:27 Program where I would help them program
34:29 over the phone I never knew what they
34:32 were making but I asked him what
34:34 computers they used and they said Oh max
34:36 for sure I said well why this is like
34:38 from 91 to about 97 and they said well
34:42 because there's no security flaws
34:44 because it's a proprietary lock system
34:46 wasn't Unix at the time was in Windows
34:48 so no one can hack us ah but apparently
34:53 NORAD in the mid 90s was using Windows
34:55 the guy that taught me about encryption
34:58 keys and how to make them for a business
35:01 project of the company I was working for
35:02 had just secured NORAD and he goes I
35:04 said well how was it and he goes well
35:07 the first thing I told him was cut the
35:08 wires because this place is wide open
35:11 mm-hmm interesting right they get
35:15 everything all the time
35:16 my friends who deal with pretty good
35:19 protection blockchain stuff they believe
35:22 that they are secure well it was just
35:24 released last week from the BBC that PGP
35:29 has a huge flaw and always has a had a
35:31 flaw and you can look right into what
35:32 you're doing funny right you think your
35:35 Bitcoin wallets are secure think again
35:38 it wasn't it sunsoo that said you know
35:41 something to the effect of if you get
35:43 the drop on your enemy don't let them
35:45 know all right if you can infiltrate
35:47 their systems and watch their
35:49 communications don't let them know when
35:51 the Xerox company helped photograph all
35:54 Hitler's
35:54 paperwork by putting video cameras or
35:57 you know movie cameras inside the Xerox
36:00 machine since that when every single
36:01 piece of paper was copied the camera was
36:05 taking a picture of it and just putting
36:06 on a movie reels when stock came to
36:09 empty out the ink it's because the video
36:14 the movie film was full it was out of
36:18 film so it would flag that it had no ink
36:20 they callin Xerox to replace the ink and
36:23 they were replacing the ink and the film
36:26 Medina for years they never called
36:28 Hitler and go we gotta hunt your things
36:30 all those rocks machines you have we're
36:32 looking at them mm-hmm all right so why
36:38 lie to the people well maybe 17 guys not
36:45 lying maybe he just dropped something
36:47 and they should be able to find out what
36:49 it is they should be able to think like
36:51 I think but they're not and so these
36:53 dudes who are maybe psyops trying to
36:56 make you look bad come out with these
36:59 outrageous stories let's go back to the
37:02 presentation this dude now it's very
37:07 difficult when you know a tremendous
37:09 amount of information not everything but
37:12 I know a tremendous amount of
37:14 information about security and when I
37:18 watch those big hacker conventions in
37:20 Russia
37:20 I watched them here at the United States
37:22 the only thing I don't know specifically
37:25 is when they're hacking into a system
37:27 all the backdoors that may exist for a
37:30 particular version of UNIX particular
37:32 version of Windows particular version of
37:34 the operating system iOS Mac OS whatever
37:38 yeah they're getting in through doors
37:40 that are fairly new fairly discovered
37:42 coveted you know their doors have been
37:44 there forever like the PGP door yeah I
37:46 don't put any time in it but I know
37:48 exactly how these little renegade files
37:51 and permissions are screwed up so they
37:53 can walk through take over a device
37:55 Apple keeps telling you that their
37:57 phones are so secure than when the bird
37:59 San Bernardino shot shots happened that
38:02 they weren't allowed of the seat you
38:04 know the FBI needed apples help to crack
38:06 the phone
38:07 figure out who these people had been
38:08 communicating let's see if they were
38:09 terrorist cell give me a break
38:12 give me a break okay get that kick kick
38:16 cat bar out right away cuz that's
38:18 complete foe [ __ ] to make you think
38:21 that phone is actually secured alright
38:24 the 17 dudes told you forever we know
38:26 everything on every single telephone
38:27 every single movie we ever wanted to
38:29 watch we watch it any photo you've ever
38:30 taken we can see it and I'm just going
38:34 to reiterate a couple examples so that
38:38 you guys understand how you have
38:41 paradigms and limitations in your mind
38:43 that are simply not true so recently
38:48 we've been able to get 300 mega bit
38:50 lines up which is about 30 mega
38:52 megabytes per second uploading to the
38:55 web we could get that in our house now
38:56 for a little over a hundred bucks
38:58 cool it's it's enough to backup
39:03 terabytes and terabytes of data on my
39:05 computer without really knowing it's
39:07 happening it's so fast right it happens
39:09 while I'm asleep too but let's say back
39:13 in the days when you couldn't get over
39:14 10 megabits 1 Meg per second and you're
39:18 thinking oh man it would take them
39:20 forever to scour my computer well that's
39:23 a binary trees trees are for is this
39:25 person on your computer oh I'll be right
39:27 back I'm on a Mac oh yeah here he is he
39:30 was in the background of a photograph
39:31 taken to Disneyland
39:32 October 25th 18 2005 hair was his GPS
39:39 well then they just nail that in the GPS
39:43 net everyone else's phone in the world
39:45 it says that they were at that location
39:46 especially if you're storing your
39:47 pictures in the cloud
39:49 hilarious they just walk through the
39:51 servers and touch your computer isn't it
39:54 funny how there's a bunch of cloud
39:55 services but a giveaway like a gigabyte
39:58 for free or whatever and then Apple the
40:00 charges like 10 times the amount it
40:02 costs anywhere else and a hundred
40:05 percent more than it cost them to store
40:06 it alright but imagine that they want to
40:11 rip your computer down 15 years ago when
40:14 you couldn't get these massive
40:15 bandwidths at your house without paying
40:17 you know thousands of dollars a month
40:20 all they have to do depending on the
40:23 strength of your network card and I
40:26 think you know if your Ethernet bound
40:27 back in the day where you're wired to
40:29 your router physically you're not using
40:30 Wireless you least had ten gigabit
40:33 usually so people are at 100 gigabit
40:35 with cat five wires before they could
40:37 ever really transmit it that quickly
40:40 they could tell all the routers in your
40:42 neighborhood that get the path from them
40:44 to you to go 100% at 4:00 in the morning
40:48 and I think walk through your drive like
40:50 they're sitting there live before you
40:53 wake up or when you move the mouse or
40:54 when you lock in the whole thing undoes
40:56 itself it goes right back to where it is
40:58 you might think oh well I've got I've
41:01 got software that monitors the event
41:03 loop of communication on my computer I
41:05 would know if they'd done something like
41:06 that look in the histogram and see it
41:08 well that's an honor system friend
41:11 that's an honor system that the
41:13 operating system is actually sharing
41:14 100% of the bandwidth with with the
41:16 event listener such that your
41:18 store-bought and software is actually
41:20 showing you what's really going on now
41:23 technically speaking you could say well
41:25 I could look at the hard drive light and
41:26 know that it's cranking like crazy well
41:28 it does it all day long and you don't
41:29 know why it's happening right now
41:32 VPNs I've been warning you guys above
41:34 epeans well what is the theory well you
41:39 got an IP address that the phone company
41:41 gives you at your house well you're
41:44 gonna use VPN software alright well you
41:47 still have to exit your house at your
41:49 VPN you do then you're going to bounce
41:52 through some servers that are going to
41:54 have their logs turned off supposedly
41:56 you can confirm that and they're
41:58 changing and scrambling your IP address
42:00 however many times you think you're
42:01 jumping so that when you reach your
42:03 destination they don't know who you are
42:05 and sure that might stop Joe Schmo from
42:08 knowing who you are but hasn't stopped
42:09 the big boys the big boys looked at all
42:12 the reassignments of your IP packet and
42:15 I'll tell you I wrote one of the very
42:17 first web log analysis apps before any
42:21 of that stuff that you can buy
42:22 off-the-shelf or get their cpanel
42:23 existed and what i had to do because i
42:26 was doing the server-side not the client
42:29 site as i would not only harvest IP
42:32 addresses but i would
42:33 also look at the split-second
42:34 millisecond requests the files and the
42:37 transmission of the data to that
42:39 particular IP address to aggregate
42:41 together who is who and they could
42:44 switch their IP address and I'm telling
42:47 you it was just a couple lines of code
42:48 to restage it back together to say no no
42:51 that's the same dude still found in the
42:53 same drive we've had no introduction of
42:55 new users at this level and you have to
42:59 jump through these breadcrumbs to get to
43:00 this point and you gotta jump back out
43:02 your breadcrumbs to get the data out of
43:04 there so if you come way deep inside the
43:06 bowels of a system with authorization
43:09 especially I either know someone's
43:11 hacked your computer and is taking your
43:13 banking information against your will
43:14 which I've never seen in my entire life
43:16 but I know it happens or we got you so
43:20 VPNs are all [ __ ] you're stopping
43:22 the little guy people in China that VPN
43:25 out so they could read the news well
43:27 China knows where they are they're just
43:29 not gonna go rate everybody's house and
43:31 say we caught you and your use of VPNs
43:33 man they would rest 50 percent of the
43:36 adult population if that was the case
43:38 we're gonna put them why I just want to
43:40 know how much their people are getting
43:41 out the door so let's go back to this
43:44 assertion is do presenting keep tell I'm
43:47 gonna go back when I see this guy talk
43:49 I'm seeing a little kid lie I'm seeing
43:54 the holes in his story because I have
43:56 this really good memory of history of
43:58 everything I've ever seen on the web I
44:00 may not remember people's names because
44:02 I don't give a [ __ ] I just want the
44:04 information once you become a nuisance
44:06 or a good resource then I put your name
44:08 on the file and I remember this dude
44:11 always says this this chick always says
44:12 this go to these resources to figure out
44:14 things Rosa Corre Grady great source for
44:17 agenda21 information Bill Cooper got
44:21 information but then he deprecated his
44:23 own history so I deprecated his
44:25 information that I got from the point he
44:27 saw the stuff and the ocean to the point
44:30 II took the interview in the late 90s on
44:33 his sofa was CNN which is this real
44:37 indie weird low quality thing but the
44:40 credentials in the room were seen in but
44:42 now let's try to give it some validity
44:44 because in remote viewing I told you
44:46 guys
44:47 the holes in this whole thing I told you
44:50 this analogy and me claiming to be able
44:52 to lift things and then paying people to
44:54 lift things for me doesn't make any
44:56 sense a boat that blows my cover right
44:59 all right so let's say you're still on
45:04 board to deny that I'm or deny that you
45:07 know I'm right and it's this little
45:10 religion you've maybe jumped on which I
45:12 doubt is most of you it's still true
45:14 because you want a belief right raise
45:19 your hand if you think that the that day
45:22 in September of 2001 didn't go as
45:25 planned and many many areas opening up
45:29 conspiracy of conspiracy and knowledge
45:31 after acknowledge but they've tried to
45:32 disinfo it but let me ask you keep your
45:38 hand up if you think that they would do
45:40 it exactly the same if they had the
45:43 chance to do it all over again
45:44 how many people would they erase before
45:48 the event took place because they found
45:49 out those people are liabilities well
45:50 they let the the Jewish dancers exist
45:53 nope
45:55 would they do a better job at putting
45:59 out misinformation and what they do
46:01 they're special effects the same way for
46:03 the nosecone that went through the
46:05 entire building popped out the other
46:06 side and then went back in the building
46:08 what about all the bad rotoscoping of
46:11 the planes going through the cranes one
46:13 of them went what is it Bob it went
46:16 behind the building it was in the
46:17 background because they would have
46:19 scoped the mass things correct
46:20 incorrectly what about the fact that the
46:24 explosion in the Pentagon happened five
46:26 minutes before the missile with wings
46:28 hit the Pentagon I think they would have
46:30 changed that I'm gonna say yes they
46:34 would have changed a ton of stuff if not
46:36 done something completely different or
46:39 done it completely different but they
46:42 didn't they made a crap ton of mistakes
46:46 how many mistakes are you following that
46:49 lets you know that something isn't the
46:50 way they said it was by supposedly these
46:53 folks that have remote viewing
46:55 capabilities through time signal
46:59 Burzynski what is it the
47:00 it's isn't it we are change.org he's the
47:05 good guy the New York kid and his name
47:09 escapes me at the moment but he went
47:12 into a meeting with Zig nervous in ski
47:14 in New York sat there and heckled the
47:16 guy unfortunately and lost his ability
47:19 to sit in the room and see what the rest
47:21 of the conversation would have gone like
47:22 but Zegna was saying who wrote the book
47:25 the grand chess game which revealed the
47:30 fact that they were gonna start this
47:32 clandestine event Dick Cheney and the
47:36 whole we need a new Pearl Harbor to get
47:38 the people behind the war in the Middle
47:40 East statement inside the neo-cons
47:42 document I think they would have erased
47:44 that document they would have they would
47:48 have just literally never written it
47:49 because they would be looking in the
47:50 future all this came back to bite us
47:52 that would come back to bite us they
47:55 would have seen for instance the wrong
47:59 people getting elected and they would
48:00 have changed it now let's say you think
48:02 the good guys have this technology not
48:03 the bad guys
48:04 that's pretty damn naive right because
48:07 these alphabet agencies that are good
48:08 they know everything that's going on in
48:10 the other side
48:11 within reason it would have changed the
48:15 script they would have changed time
48:16 before it occurred because they would
48:18 know all their mistakes but that's not
48:23 what we see they make mistakes
48:24 constantly don't they why is there a big
48:28 chasm between brown people and flat
48:31 earth people globe earth and Flat Earth
48:33 people because each faction thinks the
48:35 other faction is telling such bold-faced
48:37 lies that they are misleading the public
48:39 into perhaps a false sense of science
48:43 from one to the other or a false sense
48:45 of spirituality the field is so
48:48 important that they get angry okay that
48:53 would be the problem that the brilliant
48:55 class deep state has right now with us
48:58 they can't control us
48:59 but it's the overall goal of the deep
49:01 state its agenda 21 signed by one
49:04 hundred forty nine hundred seventy nine
49:06 countries in 1992 to depopulate this
49:08 world put under one-world government
49:09 still going to this day almost every
49:12 conspiracy out there is underneath
49:13 that agenda the Georgia Guidestones you
49:16 don't know go look them up reduce world
49:19 population to five hundred million in
49:20 perpetual balance or maintain more
49:22 population under five hundred million
49:25 and perpetual balance with nature mm-hmm
49:29 that was constructed in the early
49:31 eighties this looking-glass thing has
49:35 been around supposedly for almost thirty
49:37 years now
49:39 yeah they have a total drop on the
49:41 future they have a total drop on the
49:44 past right now let's just play this out
49:49 as if this existed in you and I have
49:51 this capability we're on the team that
49:54 discovered it we're within a military
49:57 organization has the literal physical
49:59 power to change the world in any realm
50:03 of anything that we want if it's
50:06 technically possible the US military
50:08 could get it done that's just the truth
50:10 if it's technically possible okay it's
50:14 us and let's say that we buy the
50:17 seventeen movement that there's been a
50:18 bunch of really good generals out there
50:20 which I definitely hope exists I think
50:22 they do and lower folks that are very
50:26 powerful and super intelligence and
50:28 they've got this ability to look around
50:29 time well where would you look I mean
50:33 what really matters if you could
50:36 physically travel in the past well then
50:38 a bunch of stuff would change and we
50:41 would get rid of things that look bad
50:43 we'd probably get rid of the bankers in
50:45 general there wouldn't be any banker
50:46 problems right we wouldn't have the
50:48 Federal Reserve the sixteenth amendment
50:49 the IRS we wouldn't have them but we do
50:52 right because everything's totally
50:55 time-traveling really cool at this point
50:57 right you would look in the future
51:00 because that's the only thing that's at
51:02 stake right now is the future not the
51:04 past
51:05 yeah okay because all kinds of theories
51:08 about how time works if it's fully
51:10 linear and not three-dimensional meaning
51:12 there's like I said in this episode I'm
51:14 gonna release prod before this gets out
51:15 the door you could alter things next to
51:20 you but it wouldn't matter cuz you're in
51:21 this room right you're in timeline a and
51:24 it's time line B make all the changes
51:26 you want
51:26 be you could look into B and see how the
51:29 world works it wouldn't matter because
51:30 everything in B could be completely
51:32 different than a and why worry about
51:34 that it's not your timeline but let's
51:38 say you it is linear to an extent and
51:41 which is not what they're saying which
51:43 again I just destroyed the value of that
51:45 had big epiphany that it's
51:47 three-dimensional whoop-dee-doo it's
51:48 exactly what I said in my dimensional
51:50 episode and what I've been telling
51:51 friends for 25 years without this
51:54 project you know well they look in the
51:58 future they'd see all this negative
52:01 stuff coming that's gonna remove
52:03 sovereignty install tyranny they would
52:06 see who's doing it what meetings
52:09 occurred and they wouldn't look the
52:12 other way
52:12 it's the epstein doing all this crazy
52:14 stuff they'd see people way worse than
52:17 Epstein and because these military
52:20 individuals of which some are female
52:22 would see children getting destroyed by
52:25 these people I mean in every sense of
52:27 the word every context one could fathom
52:32 they would go and probably probably just
52:37 like you and I from the wild wild west I
52:39 mean if I said okay this is this is
52:42 Tombstone Arizona a guy playing poker in
52:46 that saloon over there well back at his
52:50 cabin outside he's got three kids
52:52 strapped to a bed and then every time he
52:55 goes home he just has his way with them
52:57 what are you gonna do you gonna arrest
52:59 the guy put him to due process this is a
53:03 Wild West baby that's what the military
53:05 lives at they live at the Wild West
53:06 level because they get there they have
53:09 the license to kill man you walk in that
53:12 place without asking a question you're
53:15 doing like a Wild Bill except you do it
53:17 honorably right to his face it doesn't
53:18 even matter pal he's dead and you put
53:20 another posse to go up to his cabin to
53:22 free the kids and hope to god they can
53:24 rehabilitate and live normal lives well
53:28 it's just a simple example of what would
53:30 happen if they had this capability
53:31 looking around time you'd see someone
53:34 doing something horrible and you just go
53:36 kill him it'd be that fast
53:39 oh I didn't we didn't know until we got
53:40 this time machine travel thing and it's
53:42 it's three-dimensional we can go over
53:44 time you know XYZ te and look in the
53:47 future and see what you're gonna do that
53:48 pre-crime thing that keeps going going
53:50 around the mine or mine order a report
53:53 thing from philip k dick back in the day
53:56 if this is my prediction if the
54:01 seventeen dude endorses this time-travel
54:06 remote-viewing thing without outrageous
54:11 proof and he accounts for all the things
54:14 that aren't going right in the world why
54:16 is he having to prepare the world and be
54:17 this hero not that he says he's a hero
54:19 alright he's pretty humble about it
54:21 which is nice why are there any problems
54:23 at all because there's no such thing as
54:27 this bunch of claims i want to call it a
54:30 name keep open-minded I just had a c5
54:37 our session was summoned today that I'm
54:39 teaching some things to she's hungry for
54:43 information hungry for skills probably
54:45 the last two hours cuz we had just
54:47 chewed up what we were initially going
54:49 for academically and then you know it
54:52 was just well you know she's like well
54:54 what do you think about this what do you
54:56 think about that and she was kind of
54:57 like I want to know but I don't have
54:58 anyone I think is informed enough to
55:00 tell me and so I just sat with my laptop
55:03 I said well you gotta know about this
55:05 and the seventeen movement was one of
55:07 the guys that I mentioned and I told her
55:09 the pros and cons of this whole thing
55:11 but I showed her all this stuff the the
55:14 spirit cooking lady everybody she hangs
55:16 out with all the Gwen Stefani's Will
55:18 Ferrell's Pamela Anderson's the Robert
55:23 De Niro's with all the band-aids on the
55:27 center-left finger on Obama and John
55:29 Podesta John Podesta holding up 14 in
55:31 the fish on his hands when it's on the
55:33 gun of the kid who supposedly
55:34 slaughtered everyone in New Zealand a
55:36 videotape you're not allowed to have by
55:38 law and that funny but if this guy
55:42 endorses this then my friend who was
55:46 skeptical a year ago if not a year and a
55:48 half ago
55:50 is right the Khan has just arrived
55:55 without evidence to prove otherwise but
56:00 again it makes no sense at all
56:02 what are you fixing it in timeline b-but
56:05 you can't fix it in our timeline no
56:07 you're gonna have to talk about those
56:08 limitations right but people want to
56:10 believe there's obviously a ton of folks
56:13 on YouTube just looking for clicks just
56:15 looking for views stuff I not the case
56:17 with this show Christ I put out such
56:20 controversial episodes that in most
56:23 cases I know exactly the episode I'm
56:25 going to release that will remove 10
56:29 subscriptions now if I wanted to get 50
56:35 to 100 subscribe subscribe is every
56:37 single day I just put out crap I would
56:39 just go look at what's popular make a
56:41 kiddy video or you know review 17 posts
56:45 all day long which is fine if people do
56:47 that so I'm less elves very valuable to
56:48 hear other people's opinions but man is
56:50 so rehashed at this point it's crazy
56:53 it's so bad that's like it's like
56:55 reading the news right meticulously
56:58 reading it and understanding it and you
57:01 know what's probably fake and what's
57:02 real and then go on watching 20 shows on
57:05 YouTube to tell you the exact same thing
57:06 and you might learn two or three
57:07 epiphanies you didn't think of all right
57:10 if that's the way you want to use your
57:11 time then don't be surprised by the time
57:14 you get to into your life all your goals
57:15 are back there and they were consumed
57:18 with this movement right my thing is
57:22 read the feet as it comes out discern it
57:26 as you can but you have like um just
57:31 blows me away man the cue guys said that
57:33 we landed on the moon with some secret
57:35 secret space program that we didn't make
57:38 it the first time but we made it the
57:39 other times I mean come on it's the
57:42 additional landings that were even worse
57:44 than the first ones
57:46 seriously I mean we have to have some
57:48 limitations in our ability to our
57:51 willingness excuse me to ingest
57:53 outrageous stuff not to examine it
57:55 Examiner all you won like I said you
57:57 know there's some crazy theories out
57:59 there to me but I champion people going
58:03 into that I'm not just talking
58:04 about the one we always talk about
58:05 talking about other ones to JFK being
58:08 dead mmm-hmm it's like I haven't seen
58:11 anybody that actually looks like that
58:12 guy not once
58:13 Fusco's not that dude who's cuz about
58:17 five five five four somewhere in there
58:20 right
58:20 but the chicken looks like his wife
58:22 looks pretty damn convincing happens to
58:24 show up with other woman looks like her
58:25 sister pretty damn convincing maybe
58:28 they're just coincidences bunch of
58:31 doppelgangers all in the same place at
58:33 the same time I think they positively
58:36 ID'd some sons and children of these
58:38 people who wouldn't normally be at a
58:40 Republican rally giving it to Democratic
58:42 family so I can entertain pretty
58:45 outrageous things myself then again I
58:47 think that I'm seeing photographs with
58:49 the woman that has an Eiffel Tower ruby
58:51 ring on her hand that was custom-made
58:52 for Jackie's wife and I can't shake that
58:55 one I got friends I can send that
58:57 photograph to and they just go yeah
58:58 she's dead
58:59 why cuz that feels better I mean I got
59:04 people that are telling me deep inside
59:06 the Republican Party the dudes totally
59:09 alive I mean they just absolutely
59:11 they're senior people that are going yep
59:13 he's totally alive can't tell anything
59:14 else he's alive well okay awesome
59:18 maybe he plans on never coming out
59:20 because the problem that that there's a
59:22 legal problem with that I don't know
59:24 maybe your maybe you're a felon if you
59:26 pretend to be dead
59:28 there's no way to get around it so they
59:30 just did the math on the legal side and
59:31 said when you dude you're gonna have to
59:32 stay hidden forever
59:34 maybe we can change those laws or
59:37 whatever if you're under duress
59:38 someone's threatened your life we can
59:39 get that expunged but there's no laws
59:41 like that right now that I know of right
59:43 I want you to see some of these claims
59:46 as quite frankly a PSYOP a psychological
59:49 operation against our enemies by making
59:52 them believe that we have certain
59:54 technology and crafting like David
59:55 Blaine a great magic trick to prove it
59:58 it's all an illusion but that's how you
60:01 need how many people think we went to
60:03 the moon that was a David Blaine trick
60:06 you give them the inputs that they would
60:08 consider to be proof and you afford
60:11 someone to believe and again there's a
60:15 lie-detector test thing I always talk
60:17 about
60:17 get deep into the moon thing okay so the
60:23 people in Houston were looking at
60:25 monitors in fact I don't even think most
60:27 of them are monitors but they were
60:28 looking at like printouts and readouts
60:30 and numbers all right but let's give any
60:34 one of them the the 1000 people that
60:37 probably participated in active
60:38 operations on Apollo 11 through 17 a lie
60:41 detector test and say did we go to the
60:43 moon I think the overwhelming majority
60:47 99% of all the underlings would say yes
60:50 and they had passed that test because in
60:53 their eye we did go so maybe some of the
60:57 people talking about these operations
60:59 have been told by people they trust that
61:01 it's real and they have no scientific
61:03 ability or their scientific
61:05 predisposition to believe in certain
61:07 theories have been massaged into the
61:09 story you know you say your quantum
61:14 physicists yes okay great all right so
61:16 you have this this discipline this
61:18 discipline a bunch of it's crap right
61:20 because we erased most of how the
61:22 universe works now because I know that
61:25 you have this predisposition to believe
61:26 X is y and Y is C and all that stuff
61:30 check out this new formula we wrote C
61:33 that CT in there that's time and you see
61:36 what happens is that this number goes up
61:39 really fast and really da-da-dun that
61:41 and then magic happens and T changes
61:44 really yeah I see how that kind of makes
61:47 sense so that kind of makes sense see
61:49 that makes sense repetition is
61:50 brainwashing yeah I totally believe it
61:54 all right now now that you believe
61:58 because we told you all this stuff we
62:01 need you to study all these books
62:03 they've been pre-written for your
62:05 disposition and then at the right time
62:07 we want you to go out and you're gonna
62:08 be the guy that cracks this for the
62:10 public really yeah do goes on his khaki
62:16 pants and just rails a good illusion for
62:20 everyone to believe the reason why I
62:23 believe it's a surveillance situation is
62:26 that most of the outcome of the claim
62:31 is something that can be easily
62:32 accomplished in a surveillance program
62:35 and think about this if you've ever
62:38 developed software for any number of
62:40 years or if you've written movies for
62:42 any number of years or you've had to
62:44 name something you're a person names
62:47 cars you're the person who names a
62:49 perfume you will have experiences
62:52 several times in your lifetime
62:54 I certainly have experienced it you'll
62:57 pick a name that you think is so unique
62:58 you think it has metaphor and it has
63:02 some really cool name then all of a
63:04 sudden you discover someone else has the
63:07 exact it's a type of product with the
63:09 exact same name because the big epiphany
63:11 you thought you had which which you
63:14 thought was the original thought was
63:15 actually a really obvious thought and
63:18 someone else has it so you have to
63:21 change the name of your product because
63:24 they already have the name recognition
63:24 out there for that exact product and you
63:27 need to be a competitor just ask our
63:30 company's man they've been naming their
63:32 cars all these weird names they have
63:33 computers that generate names because
63:35 they don't want to run into copyright
63:36 problems from other companies so
63:39 something called
63:40 Looking Glass something come on how many
63:43 hundreds of projects have probably been
63:45 called looking class and all kinds of
63:47 research centers corporations video
63:50 games a ton of them it's just because
63:53 the 17 guy mentions that word doesn't
63:56 mean the first thing you look up is the
63:57 thing now maybe he made a link out to it
63:59 I can't remember the post but if he's
64:02 referring to this thing directly time to
64:06 put on your big-boy pants and walk away
64:10 it doesn't matter the David Blaine trick
64:12 they show you to make you believe this
64:13 thing doesn't mean it's real because
64:17 again the world would be a different
64:20 place so why be concerned about this
64:24 weird little claim if you're like yeah
64:26 of course it's stupid don't even why
64:27 even paying attention to that 17 thing
64:30 because a lot of people are and they're
64:33 seeing it as their Messiah they're
64:35 seeing it as their hero I mean if
64:38 anything he is the Jesus Christ he's a
64:43 savior
64:44 now he doesn't clean personally I'm your
64:47 hero worship me as a nice thing but did
64:50 Jesus say that not really
64:52 you know the fictional story of Jesus he
64:54 just basically said worship the God the
64:57 Father and everything will be okay
64:59 pretty good advice in my opinion I guess
65:02 the slippery slope that we're dealing
65:04 with right now is the injection of
65:07 cognitive dissidence into our society
65:09 most of you know that so how do you
65:12 combat it you want to know on one level
65:16 everything that's being claimed you do
65:19 because you're a member of this world
65:21 and if anything you know if well let's
65:23 put this way there's the I don't mention
65:29 Koresh because I think a lot of really
65:30 nasty things happen I think he's
65:32 probably accused of some things that may
65:35 or may not have taken place don't know
65:37 he's a word one but let's just say a
65:40 religious leader uses the internet uses
65:44 whatever tools he can to create
65:45 illusions for people and five people
65:49 move into his two-bedroom apartment and
65:52 start worshiping him as a God on earth
65:54 the next Jesus they give him all of his
65:58 money they sleep with the guy whatever
65:59 they do hmm
66:01 not a good situation but come on and
66:03 it's six people involved in this project
66:05 soup-to-nuts mean whatever but now let's
66:09 say the guy turns into like the next
66:11 Hitler he's got millions of followers
66:14 because this illusion works on everybody
66:16 who is gullible to his level
66:18 remember you can con people below your
66:21 intelligence level and again there's
66:23 people with high accusing and still be
66:24 conned because in the spectrum of the
66:26 con job there neophytes they're ignorant
66:30 to what could be real and what could be
66:33 fake you know what's what shocks me is
66:37 that anytime I see these videos like the
66:40 compilation video this guy put together
66:42 what you did again I did a great job
66:43 hats off to that dude regardless if this
66:45 is true or false or whatever I never
66:48 hear the criticism the devil's advocate
66:53 to the claim and if you do hear it you
66:56 hear it it
66:57 for work she almost never hear it but
66:59 the other one is if you hear it it's
67:01 like usually someone being flip it now
67:03 you guys are stupid for believing that
67:05 okay well that's fine why are we stupid
67:08 and there because you're just dumb
67:10 everybody knows it's the other way okay
67:15 okay in debate class you get a big F
67:18 plus and you can leave the room and you
67:19 lose and then the conclusion is not made
67:23 that one is right and one is wrong it's
67:24 just you don't know how to debate you
67:26 know making your case if you're an
67:27 attorney you would just walk up to the
67:30 jury go - my clients innocent because
67:32 that's not gonna sway anybody's opinion
67:36 so in my personal experience the reason
67:39 why I make these videos is that I'm I'm
67:42 the only guy no this suggests that if
67:44 you had future future looking technology
67:47 and past looking technology I don't know
67:49 what how you know the past would help of
67:51 them and reengineering the past which is
67:53 definitely not taking place we think
67:56 right I mean it's the theory goes like
67:58 this which wasn't a part of this video
68:01 but let's just say at some point you
68:04 don't have time travel technology and
68:05 then whether it be looking glass or
68:09 physical traveling but then you do have
68:13 it and then you can start playing with
68:15 timeline and then you're going to
68:17 obviously figure out very quickly
68:18 whether or not time is fully linear or
68:20 multi-dimensional and again if it's
68:22 multi-dimensional and that's another
68:24 time in a different dimension with
68:26 different results and you don't live in
68:28 it
68:29 go watch French for a big binge on this
68:32 theory it's awesome but let's just say
68:36 you know something happened in the past
68:40 that these people in control don't want
68:42 to have happen well I guarantee there'd
68:45 be a lot of wars that would be flipped
68:46 the other way there'd be a lot of losses
68:49 in general for these people that would
68:51 all be reversed I mean it would be think
68:54 about it think about you being in charge
68:56 of the situation and you're and when
68:59 you're mine you're for the good side
69:01 will there be really the dark side of
69:03 the good side doesn't matter would
69:05 Hillary's emails ever get caught No
69:10 never what a presidential election ever
69:12 got the way that they didn't want it to
69:13 go no never
69:16 they just go back and change it and go
69:19 back and changing back and change it and
69:20 we just constantly keep changing to the
69:23 point where we'd find ourselves in some
69:25 tyrannical world so the the Duty was
69:29 putting this together was really I think
69:31 green to this whole time spectrum
69:35 conversation because the you know when I
69:41 hear someone say M ed again this is like
69:44 for people that have never thought about
69:45 it before the con job is super simple
69:48 right but if you think about it a lot
69:50 and really run the scenarios down your
69:52 mind you're like yeah yeah whatever dude
69:54 you're not even thinking it to chess
69:56 moves ahead you're one chess move into
69:57 this concept and you think the world's
69:59 gonna be a different place it ain't
70:01 gonna be in a different place sorry dude
70:02 but the guy was like well you know most
70:07 of you don't understand man Tom ain't
70:09 linear is multi-dimensional was what I
70:11 heard okay professor Stay Puft you know
70:17 it's like really that's your big
70:20 crescendo moment the their big hook in
70:23 the beginning of your episode to say now
70:25 listen to this guy lie to you for
70:27 however long he's gonna lie to you
70:28 in this presentation why don't we make
70:31 episodes about things we don't talk
70:32 about because you need to can you think
70:35 it through I'm trying to take you down
70:37 these paths and I think most of you I
70:39 mean honestly I'm not I'm preaching to
70:41 the choir I'm preaching to people that
70:42 have thought about this as much as I
70:45 have if not more trust me I'm not trying
70:47 to belittle anybody who's listening but
70:50 as you spread your wings and travel this
70:52 world and talk to other people and you
70:55 know whether or not your gorgeous model
70:57 from Finland you're an influencer if you
71:01 have your thought process straight so
71:05 you know it's kind of up to you to get
71:07 as informed as you possibly can you know
71:09 what you feel very certain about
71:10 something because you've strung some
71:12 things together say so and where you're
71:15 like well I don't think I don't see that
71:17 connecting what the other thing you know
71:18 and this is why maybe you across the
71:20 table this other person you're talking
71:22 to can
71:23 in the blanks if they happen to believe
71:25 it the other way and you know I
71:28 mentioned they've been Mendell effect a
71:30 little bit in my other episode and you
71:33 know some people might say well look at
71:34 the Mendell effect that's proof they've
71:35 been changing time as I know it isn't
71:37 because if you changed Berenstein to
71:41 Berenstain at some point then the whole
71:44 world would remember Bernstein and go
71:47 how did it get the Berenstain you
71:48 wouldn't have a giant part of the world
71:50 go no no that's always been Berenstain
71:51 that's not an absolute time model and
71:55 you know here's the other thing too if
72:00 because this has been claimed several
72:01 times on coast to coast several times on
72:04 the Internet and it's kind of calmed
72:06 down all these these remote viewing
72:08 things have calmed down yes they spent a
72:10 ton of money on yes supposedly they
72:12 believed that this was working at some
72:14 point but again everything would be
72:16 different be a lot more fortunate for
72:18 these countries and then what they've
72:19 experienced you know it's just like it's
72:24 kind of like when you body build if any
72:27 of you familiar with that process when
72:29 you want to want to get big you book on
72:32 and then you cut all right you put a
72:34 whole bunch of mass on your body and
72:37 then you exercise in a particular way
72:39 where you cut everything down to the
72:41 parts you want to keep and I think
72:44 that's sort of how we have to run our
72:45 minds build up all your skepticism all
72:49 the potential truths that maybe haven't
72:51 had time to dig into and then you need
72:54 to do a cut a purge things that don't
72:57 matter to you why not just throw them
72:59 out the door because you got other
73:01 things to focus on and remember you got
73:02 to live your life in the middle of all
73:04 this crazy research because it can
73:06 consume you I do wonder what the god
73:10 fact is on people that are following the
73:11 17 movement and other you know movements
73:14 that are lot more hateful and they're
73:17 gonna wake up and realize you know
73:18 imagine an NT [ __ ] it
73:20 poor kid 18 years old say he managed
73:23 just to pull off 10 years in this
73:25 organization and at 28 the economy
73:29 changes he loses his job all the things
73:31 he was mad about either has changed his
73:33 mind or the thing is the opportunity
73:35 there
73:36 all the contingency stuff goes away I
73:38 mean what they're mad about changes or
73:40 they just get tired we had any more
73:43 energy to do it
73:44 then they get into the 30s and 40s and
73:46 look back burn my cousin who debt he
73:50 died he told me why are you going back
73:52 to college to get a degree
73:54 you already do what you love to do and
73:56 you make a ton of money doing it I'm
73:57 like yeah because don't do what I did I
74:00 spent 10 years in college becoming you
74:03 know a PhD chemist and I said yeah but
74:06 you got a bunch of stuff you know so do
74:08 you don't waste your life man at least
74:11 he had a reward for it but these kids
74:14 that are blowing all their life like
74:15 it's like spending every dime after
74:17 payday you never get your 20s back man
74:20 you never get any year back you never
74:23 get any minute back in your life so
74:25 hopefully what you're spending your time
74:27 on is something that's deeply important
74:29 to you and it's probably most healthy to
74:33 take it in some level of moderation
74:34 where you can enjoy a sunset sunrise a
74:39 sunny afternoon your kids giggling
74:41 because something funny happened on TV
74:43 or you said a little joke let me know
74:46 what you think let me know if you've
74:49 done a deeper dive and you're like dude
74:51 you're telling a base whatever if you
74:52 don't talk to me about time this episode
74:55 is full of all your homework this
74:58 episode is full of everything you have
75:00 to explain if there's multi-dimensional
75:01 time then how is modifying at different
75:04 time zone or different time dimension
75:07 gonna affect you you're not in that time
75:08 to mention you know don't be swept away
75:12 by sci-fi talk it's fun entertain
75:16 yourself with it maybe you become a
75:17 screenwriter because you have so many
75:19 cool ideas about how time could be
75:21 creative create a premise greatest story
75:23 write a movie I got all kinds up with so
75:25 they'll teach you how to write one do it
75:27 maybe you're not a screenwriter maybe
75:29 you're more of a novel writer maybe
75:30 you're more of a TV writer whatever
75:32 maybe write plays for God's sakes and
75:34 heed the warning of my friend that you
75:38 get manipulated up to a point
75:40 you start believing something is real
75:42 and then you get had at the last second
75:45 running jumping off on the total crazy
75:47 zone
75:48 I'm careful careful but if you have them
75:52 into deep thoughts radio calm please go
