00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentlemen I'm fighting a little bit of a
00:36 cold it's I've got it stuck in my nose
00:38 it won't go anywhere else but it's
00:41 bothering it's just making me a little
00:43 sniffily and I'm awful my vitamin C so
00:49 today's episode as I smoked the last one
00:53 Polly damn it's a good episode to smoke
00:57 the Sun I got a call about an hour ago
01:02 letting me know that a very legendary
01:05 person in my family has passed away and
01:09 he lived a full life okay so we can be
01:15 [Music]
01:17 we don't have to be tragically destroyed
01:20 by this information you know it's just
01:23 one of those things where you're like
01:25 wow I knew everybody passes you know
01:29 it's just that's just life but this
01:32 person was epic and I have talked about
01:34 this person
01:35 countless times on this show if talking
01:39 about his whole family on this show so I
01:42 thought I would do an episode just
01:43 reflecting on the emotions of when this
01:45 happens and it's new and it's fresh I
01:49 would give a male perspective I'm gonna
01:52 give an American perspective but I
01:55 thought it might be valuable for you to
01:56 hear my thoughts about these sorts of
01:59 experiences because they don't happen
02:01 that often but as I get older of course
02:02 this is gonna happen
02:04 more often and if I outlive everybody
02:09 then it won't happen at all so this is a
02:15 gentleman that I refer to as my uncle
02:17 now I have an uncle that I refer to on
02:20 the show taught me computers it's not
02:22 that guy this is technically my second
02:24 cousin it's my father's first cousin so
02:27 you'll understand he's the same age as
02:29 my father so I always call him uncle but
02:32 every once in a while I'll say he's my
02:33 second cousin do
02:35 his kids were a little bit younger than
02:37 me but definitely within intellectual
02:40 range this entire family this it's my
02:46 family but his mother was my
02:49 grandfather's sister on my father's side
02:54 he's the big chemistry genius among
02:57 other things he ran several
03:00 pharmaceutical companies prior to them
03:03 becoming what they are today so we don't
03:06 need to lump him in with what's going on
03:09 today he's been retired for a long time
03:12 but it's interesting when you lose
03:14 someone your family that has sort of
03:16 this reputation now he and my father
03:20 hung out a lot when they were in high
03:21 school so I have all these endearing
03:23 amazing stories about these two and
03:27 other friends of theirs just you know
03:29 wreaking havoc on the world in a fun way
03:33 but it's interesting you know you have
03:35 as a male of a particular family where
03:38 regardless of what anyone else thinks in
03:41 the family if you're a person who really
03:43 thinks of your family as sort of this
03:44 this genealogy tree and you acknowledge
03:52 that you're made out of the same DNA in
03:54 large part of course there's always a
03:56 spouse that's it's new that you don't
03:58 have any connection with there's sort of
04:03 this passing of the guard because as the
04:07 elders pass away in your family line
04:10 regardless if you acknowledge it or not
04:13 you're the next in line you're the next
04:15 elder in the family you are the family
04:18 now it's fantastic about this gentleman
04:20 is that you know I think when we reach
04:24 the end you sort of want to look back on
04:29 your life and go did I do it then I live
04:31 a life if you're a woman and you want to
04:34 have become a woman by your definition
04:38 no one else's definition matters did you
04:41 do it did you want to become a man did
04:45 you do it
04:46 this guy did it he did everything he
04:49 travelled the world he literally went
04:52 around the world and I think 17 18 years
04:55 old you know he's he's an uber prodigy
05:00 uber prodigy but you know what's even
05:04 better
05:05 he's one of the nicest guys you'll ever
05:07 meet in your life
05:08 and he's just cool he was just totally
05:12 cool man he would if you had a bad day I
05:16 swear to god you get even in this guy's
05:18 aura you suddenly redoubled your your
05:22 priorities in life because he's there
05:26 and he's smiling at you and his smile is
05:30 as old as Buddha's smile you know I mean
05:32 it is phenomenal just calms your soul I
05:36 told you guys for the you avid listeners
05:40 there's a gentleman of my family with a
05:43 PhD that talked me out of going back to
05:45 college because he said look you already
05:49 do what you love to do right I said yeah
05:51 and you know you do self teach right
05:55 yeah so why you going to college and I
05:58 said dude you got a PhD he says yeah I
06:02 do and I lost 10 years of my life
06:05 getting that PhD now he needed a PhD for
06:10 what he did and this is the gentleman
06:13 who just passed the pivot of that moment
06:19 1993 of him talking me out of moving
06:23 back to the Midwest and going to school
06:24 which was going to be in Texas at the
06:26 time it changed everything now who knows
06:31 if Texas would have been wonderful for
06:33 me who knows but what I accomplished in
06:37 the Bay Area Silicon Valley after that
06:39 point from 93 to 2002 and what I've been
06:41 able to accomplish here in Southern
06:43 California from 2003 to present it just
06:48 could not have occurred without being
06:50 there and there's something about for me
06:56 you know there's the
06:58 they're definitely males in my family
07:01 they're very specifically one that will
07:05 regardless unless he gets hit on the
07:07 head and sees life differently and it
07:11 would have to be hit on the head and
07:13 then he would have to automatically
07:14 learn about a lot about the human
07:16 condition in life he will absolutely die
07:19 whether he lives to be 200 years old or
07:22 a thousand years old he will die a child
07:25 and he will have done more harm to this
07:27 world than good because that's who he is
07:32 so when you have that as a reference
07:35 within your family sort of a black sheep
07:38 that's truly a black sheep the one you
07:42 would clip off if you could just go
07:43 ahead branch and never happened right
07:46 and we don't have that kind of pool in
07:48 our family and I think he gets one from
07:50 the other side to be honest when you
07:52 have a great guy pass and go to the
07:56 other side you know I think he could
08:00 have it seems to me like you know if he
08:02 had lived in his 90s he was in his 70s
08:05 mid to late 70s I think I live to be a
08:09 hundred you wouldn't have been the
08:10 slightest bit surprised and then you're
08:14 kind of like well okay he passed in his
08:17 70s all right well I would always want
08:20 someone to have more time than that but
08:23 he lived it he you know he did a great a
08:25 great run and this planet now those of
08:30 you know me and the show I believe in
08:33 reincarnation and I believe that after
08:36 you pass I think I have seen utter proof
08:39 that your spirits on the other side and
08:41 you can pretty much due in large part
08:44 what you want if you want to be reborn I
08:47 suppose you you make the choice it
08:49 doesn't just happen do you want to hang
08:51 out and walk around your old house you
08:54 can do that too gonna go somewhere else
08:56 in the world
08:57 you've never been another planet
08:59 whatever you can do it so one of the
09:03 interesting things I always reflect on
09:05 is he and I were never able to spend a
09:09 lot of time together
09:11 either I was in the Bay Area where he
09:13 lives and I was so self-involved and you
09:16 know dealing with all kinds of my
09:18 personal problems or successes or
09:20 whatever that I never really made a
09:23 effort to go see him plus he was still
09:25 working so it's his schedule my schedule
09:27 I you know of course looking back I
09:30 should have put the effort in but
09:33 there's also this you have a connection
09:35 with the family member because you're
09:37 always hearing about what they're doing
09:38 and so you feel like you're close to
09:40 them even though you're not physically
09:41 close to them and that's something we
09:45 have because of the digital age right
09:48 the internet gives you the solution
09:50 you're with people when you're really
09:51 not and what we lose by not being with
09:54 them physically in the same room is
09:56 probably you know immeasurable but I've
10:03 always wanted to have a closer
10:05 friendship with him and among other
10:08 things get his opinion about certain
10:11 things in my life and I don't know if
10:14 time is linear for the other side that's
10:17 the other big question I don't really
10:20 think time exists like most of us but is
10:23 there some methodology where you could
10:27 help yourself you know you pass away at
10:30 90 and you go back and help yourself at
10:32 10 years old you know I don't know I
10:34 don't put much thought into that sort of
10:37 process but when my grandparents passed
10:40 away what was interesting is as I as I
10:44 thought about the instincts that I have
10:46 for the afterlife which you know they
10:49 are guttural instincts where else could
10:51 you get your belief systems from right
10:53 it was always impossible for my
10:56 grandparents to completely understand
10:58 what I did for a living had I stayed in
11:01 my hometown and drove a tractor or sold
11:04 you know farmers feed or done something
11:08 else they could have understood it
11:10 completely this dude would have no
11:13 problem understanding anything he might
11:15 ask me a lot of questions but he could
11:17 get it trust me but now the way I look
11:22 at it is
11:23 he can explore my world more infinitely
11:28 than I can explore my world he can
11:31 totally see what I'm doing apply his
11:34 wisdom to it and anything else he gains
11:36 by being on the other side and gift me
11:39 with intuition at times right so I think
11:44 that's cool
11:44 I thought about that you know years
11:47 after my grandparents passed that now
11:50 you're with me now you can see what's
11:52 going on and of course I always reach
11:56 out to them and in speech and say you
11:59 know you're welcome to influence me
12:01 however you want because I trust you a
12:02 thousand percent now still my thought
12:05 that you know my reincarnation episode I
12:08 went over this but I do think that we
12:11 have limited knowledge regardless of
12:13 what realm we're in because to be gifted
12:15 with infinite knowledge would be very
12:18 maybe you know sort of like kills all of
12:22 your inspiration because what would you
12:24 be inspired to do you know everything
12:26 you don't need to read that book you
12:27 know what's in that book you don't need
12:28 to learn that science you know how to do
12:29 that science you don't need to build
12:32 that thing to accomplish that goal that
12:34 you've never accomplished because you
12:36 have so much knowledge even if you
12:37 haven't really technically done it you
12:41 can't have done it in your brain right
12:43 so I think we do maintain a bit of sort
12:46 of mental mortality there's a small
12:52 party going on in the house behind me so
12:54 if you hear laughter that is not
12:56 something else in your environment
12:57 that's in my environment they're having
12:59 a great time so I love it so the other
13:03 thing that I felt like I had in common
13:05 with this gentleman is that some of us
13:12 grow up a lot faster than other people
13:14 and I don't know if it's because we have
13:17 old souls I don't know what it is I feel
13:19 I feel like and I've said this in
13:21 several different episodes you know I I
13:25 was I enjoyed being a kid but primarily
13:28 because of the freedom that I gained by
13:31 being a child I didn't have to work and
13:32 have to pay any bills and so that was
13:35 the most entertaining part about
13:37 a child you know by the age of nine I
13:40 loved being a kid but I'd say zero to
13:45 seven not so much it didn't have
13:49 anything to do with my dreams I was
13:50 having which are a bunch of nightmares
13:51 of the time at the time it was that when
13:55 I went to school it was always so kitty
13:58 you know and it was parts of school that
14:01 I absolutely loved I love the
14:02 imagination that went with storytelling
14:04 and reading when I was learning how to
14:06 speak English and spell and that kind of
14:08 stuff man my brain lived in these books
14:10 and lived in these educational courses
14:13 that they had so that was great and I
14:17 don't know whether or not this this guy
14:20 had the same situation that I had but it
14:24 always seemed like he was ahead of the
14:25 curve
14:26 every time my father told me a story
14:28 about them hanging out together doing
14:31 things
14:32 this dude was most likely so brilliant
14:37 that he was just you know now I go to
14:40 school I'll get that a and then I'm just
14:42 gonna go find something else to do
14:44 that's got some zest to it some life to
14:46 it I told the story about him I don't
14:50 know how many episodes ago some of you
14:52 will remember this story now you know
14:54 who I'm talking about he in his late
14:58 teens I guess it was 16 17 somewhere in
15:01 there maybe just 17 I don't know what
15:03 exact years it was but he got into some
15:07 some petty crime he was I think enjoying
15:12 the rush because I have a good friend of
15:14 mine in high school that end up getting
15:15 murdered because he got into drug
15:17 dealing but before that I had moved long
15:20 had moved away to California but he
15:23 ended up doing a deal and getting killed
15:24 that's not the guy I'm talking about but
15:26 my relative might have had a similar
15:31 situation where he's so smart he's so
15:33 bored with life that this had some you
15:36 know some zest to it right but he got in
15:39 trouble he got caught I get the sense he
15:42 got caught fairly quick and in the midst
15:44 of doing this but his father approached
15:48 the judge who was going to hand him down
15:50 some juvenile hall kind of thing he says
15:53 I got a much better plan if you release
15:56 him to me here's my plan and his father
16:00 put him on a boat I think on the East
16:01 Coast thing in New York or something and
16:03 made him go around the world on a ship
16:07 he sets out my dad tells the story and
16:11 so he goes all the way around the world
16:12 and comes back to I think San Diego or
16:15 something but at some point he ended up
16:18 in Germany but maybe that's maybe the
16:21 story isn't really completely accurate
16:25 and I think about it but he he did go
16:27 around the world but the idea is he
16:28 stopped in Germany and he had taken
16:29 German in high school so he freshed up
16:32 his German got it fluent and then
16:35 learned technical German so that he
16:37 could become a chemist and that's where
16:39 he got his PhD he works and he's when I
16:43 had chemists at Merck for 20 years at
16:45 least pops out of that goes to Japan
16:50 works it teaches himself Japanese and
16:53 technical Japanese I mean imagine you
16:56 know walking in having to the speaking
16:59 of Japanese to you know be fluent and
17:02 then speak in a scientific manner with
17:05 other Japanese scientists he invented
17:09 this crazy tape that we have been robbed
17:13 because he invented this tape that took
17:16 some of the active ingredients out of
17:18 cocaine without any stimulus of course
17:20 and it would you put it on your braces
17:23 and it would speed up braces to weeks
17:28 and months instead of years you just
17:31 take it off and your your gums heart or
17:34 your sorry your bone structure hardens
17:35 up and your gums grab your teeth
17:36 perfectly and you're done
17:38 he had it completely done through
17:39 clinical studies ready to release to the
17:41 world and the gentleman that owned the
17:43 company died and I guess in Japan the
17:46 son the firstborn can inherit the
17:50 company and do it do with it whatever he
17:53 wants and they dude I mean I hope he got
17:56 a big payoff because he let go a
17:58 billion-dollar industry to go do
18:00 something else silly
18:02 and as far as I know I think the last
18:05 thing we heard about that company is it
18:07 ain't because the Sun didn't have the
18:09 same foresight as his father it's so out
18:12 of some weird coincidence I had moved to
18:15 the Bay Area in 91 he moved to the Bay
18:18 Area after this Japanese debacle and
18:21 just was writing protocols for Bausch
18:24 and Lomb enjoying his life had a
18:27 beautiful house three great kids and so
18:32 you know he finished up because now it's
18:36 been 25 years and he just passed at that
18:40 house as I understand it so he lived a
18:44 beautiful life you know but in my family
18:47 what's interesting is there at least my
18:51 father I really respect my father who's
18:53 still alive
18:54 because he always put it into me that
18:57 our last name our surname meant
19:00 something and that's how you govern who
19:03 you are in the world you don't do
19:04 certain things if you carry this name
19:07 now my mom's side they also had that and
19:11 my grandmother my father's side also had
19:13 that too so everybody's really conscious
19:15 of the hard work that people put into
19:19 building our family reputation and I you
19:24 know we have like half a dozen other
19:25 doctors and her family all different
19:28 disciplines medical doctors and English
19:33 doctors and eye doctors and all that
19:36 stuff but as these Masters of the
19:41 Universe pass away people I really
19:44 admire I feel that baton being passed
19:51 and I'm more than happy to take that
19:54 baton there's no anxiety about it at all
19:57 it's okay it's time to man up you know I
20:00 mean regardless of what you're doing and
20:02 could think about what this is
20:04 keep up the reputation keep up your
20:06 morals and your ethics be a be a good
20:09 person there's one thing you know
20:13 I get this comment and it is probably
20:17 the highest form of flattery that I get
20:20 from you guys and I just want to say
20:22 thank you which is you will comment on
20:25 my voice and I think Tim just posted on
20:29 this and he said that he had gone to
20:32 sleep in an episode and then he woke up
20:34 and my voice was still talking to him
20:35 and but people have said that it's
20:39 soothing to them and I I think that's
20:41 wonderful right so in a way thinking
20:47 about his name's Larry he did that to me
20:52 when I was around him the few times I
20:55 was around him he was just magical when
20:57 he's like six five and so you know he's
21:02 just bigger than life but I would say he
21:06 used his powers for good I think that's
21:08 the greatest thing my father had a
21:10 really good eye for these kind of folks
21:12 too if that was his cousin but even his
21:14 some of his closest friends had this
21:16 this Billy Dee Williams you know vibe to
21:19 him and man no matter what was going on
21:21 you were just kind of like oh wow
21:23 I need to get to that point where I'm
21:25 not easily stressed out I'm not easily
21:29 excited I don't have bad days that often
21:31 you know that kind of thing so I've done
21:34 my best up to this point and I continue
21:38 to strive to create these moments where
21:40 you know when something goes wrong you
21:44 know I'm there for folks and what's
21:46 really strange about it is when I became
21:48 a manager at Electronic Arts and I had
21:52 this huge team you know like 55 people
21:54 it's a three different noises four
21:58 different divisions when something would
22:01 go wrong for someone else I found it
22:03 almost a natural case for my genetics to
22:09 get in there and soothe the moment
22:13 triage anything that's gone wrong and
22:16 get everybody to you know calm down
22:20 and then but what's funny was I would
22:24 come home and you know something would
22:26 get on my nerves at home you know
22:29 something in life or whatever and I
22:33 would find that the skill set I had for
22:35 other people was almost non-existent for
22:39 myself it's really strange and then of
22:42 course once I finally realized that I
22:45 had I had the skill for the people but
22:47 not for myself then I started to to use
22:51 it you know on myself the black Apple
22:54 phenomenon is the way I have gained an
22:59 exponential level of control once I
23:02 realized I was watching movies in my
23:04 mind about my life about circumstances
23:08 and and you know again the black Apple
23:11 is so hideous you know it can use all
23:14 the circumstances of real life and then
23:17 it twists and turns them and just ever
23:20 so slightly means literally the devil's
23:22 playground is all I can say why don't
23:24 you realize those aren't your thoughts
23:25 and you're just watching you're just
23:27 like oh whoa oh yeah that guy could
23:29 totally be you know rude and be stealing
23:32 from you or this girl is doing this so
23:34 that once you realize that none of
23:36 that's actually occurring it's just this
23:37 movie that's being played at you it
23:39 really gives you a tremendous amount of
23:41 control but what's interesting is you
23:44 know I have a I don't want to say this
23:47 in the braggadocious way okay when you
23:50 have a more photographic memory mind
23:52 than some other type of mind I don't
23:55 even know what other type of brains you
23:56 can have everything's very visual and
24:00 again I see timelines all the time
24:03 what I'm recording this show when I'm
24:04 staring at is the timeline of the audio
24:07 track as it's you know burping the the
24:09 volumes into these little vertical lines
24:12 I see my whole life like that I see my
24:15 life and decade containers which I
24:18 probably shouldn't allow myself to do
24:19 that but I see the 40s the 50s the 60s
24:22 the 70s 80s and so I'm always kind of
24:24 you know curious Oh which one am I gonna
24:27 die in you know if something happens
24:30 it's just you know you hit by a bus well
24:33 whatever
24:34 you can't plan for that you can't worry
24:35 about that just look both ways before
24:37 you cross traffic you know don't go
24:40 trying to do it in Russia and for those
24:43 of you don't get that reference the
24:46 amount of people murdered or killed on
24:49 crosswalks in Russia right now it's like
24:52 it's it's so bad they should literally
24:54 ground all the cars for a day and then
24:57 have like how to cross the street month
24:59 every year so that their citizens
25:01 understand that there's these things
25:03 called cars and trucks and motorcycles
25:06 and scooters and that they need to go
25:09 left right left before they cross
25:10 because the amount of like adults just
25:13 walking in front of cars and getting
25:15 pummeled to death it's it's an epidemic
25:18 it's strange to me you know but your
25:23 life is this interesting Ginga thing
25:25 right the you know the game where you
25:27 stack the blocks three blocks on every
25:29 floor you know changes directions and
25:31 you pull the blocks out and not letting
25:34 it fall we're not trying to pull
25:36 anything out we're still building it and
25:39 so we have these errors in our life what
25:42 we like in your teens what we like in
25:44 your 20s your 30s and you might be
25:46 really envious of yourself and say oh my
25:50 gosh my 20s were amazing and mine were
25:53 but the saddest thing you can do is to
25:57 obviously pigeonhole yourself in Ving
26:01 your past right you get these people on
26:03 Facebook they can never post a modern
26:05 photograph they only post the past 24/7
26:09 it's the weirdest thing so how much of
26:12 the president could they possibly be
26:13 living by constantly reminiscing in
26:16 their own mind well this is when life
26:18 was good this is when life was great and
26:20 say hey newsflash life could be
26:23 absolutely better than it ever was in
26:26 the past if he would just allow the
26:28 present to occur so when I see these
26:31 heroes of mine pass that lived full
26:35 life's that it made every decade count I
26:39 feel an obligation to grow up and do the
26:42 same thing with my own life right
26:46 and it's the thing that you know I think
26:49 I've told you guys in high school you
26:53 know I lost a really good friend of mine
26:55 it was it was strange when I was in my
27:00 junior year I guess it was the
27:02 transition between sophomore and junior
27:03 year we had a couple we had a string of
27:07 accidents we had some weather-related
27:09 accidents where people I work with died
27:11 we had just some bad decisions made by
27:15 one individual that got three other
27:18 people killed so you own two three yeah
27:21 and another person severely injured who
27:23 eventually completely recovered I mean
27:26 this dude took ten years to recover and
27:29 so a good friend of mine and someone I
27:32 really idolized had passed and in this
27:37 accident and I had just spent the
27:42 previous I spent that night hanging out
27:45 with him and it was this weird thing
27:48 that we did because I really liked the
27:49 guy he was older than me by two or three
27:52 years and again he always treated me
27:54 like gold in front of the other kids and
27:56 so you know you can't get some juice
27:59 from that people like oh well if he
28:00 likes him then he must be a cool guy and
28:02 so that really helped me totally avoid
28:06 any awkwardness when I transitioned from
28:08 a middle school to high school which are
28:11 our first grade is 10th grade and so he
28:14 and I worked at Walmart at the time and
28:16 I'd come home to this gas station and
28:18 chill out and get some food
28:19 I used to microwave this pizza and I
28:21 guess drink a coke and he and I he had
28:24 the same routine I don't know why
28:26 because he I don't think he lived
28:27 anywhere near me but maybe he did and
28:30 but he would show up and we would just
28:33 get a chance to talk we play this one
28:35 particular it was called hot pursuit
28:38 pinball machine with a little siren on
28:40 top it's really super cool man look at
28:42 first like super 3d pinball machine
28:45 games that really hit its stride it
28:47 sparked digital it's got a lot of you
28:49 know analog stuff in it as well so we
28:52 were doing this routinely and that
28:54 particular night you know it was a
28:55 really good session between the two of
28:57 us and
28:58 I went home I'm dead I go to sleep he
29:01 stayed up and he got in this accident
29:04 that took his life and when that
29:07 happened there was all kinds of things
29:13 going through my head because I was 16
29:15 years old and he must have been 18 or 19
29:19 years old and I thought man I appreciate
29:25 his 19 he didn't get a chance to live
29:28 his life and I'm pretty sure he would
29:31 have lived a really good life no matter
29:34 what decisions he made no matter where
29:35 he ended up living and so part of me you
29:39 know year later I finished high school
29:41 and I guess a year and a half two years
29:44 later and I you know I said to this dude
29:47 just like like a prayer almost right
29:50 just saying it out loud you know I said
29:53 to him come with me let's go to
29:55 California you didn't get a chance to do
29:58 anything here beyond 19 and I got some
30:01 pretty good goals and some pretty good
30:03 skills let's have some fun and for at
30:06 least a decade I felt like he was with
30:09 me anytime I succeeded I felt like both
30:12 of us were succeeding it was just my
30:15 choice to interpret things like that
30:17 right but let's just say you know my
30:21 cousin Larry and I had just had a
30:24 conversation today let's just say or
30:26 yesterday and the say I'm sharing my
30:29 life with him I know without knowing he
30:34 would be extremely supportive and just
30:36 be like go go go go work hard put your
30:40 best foot forward when you think you're
30:44 done keep polishing and get on to the
30:46 next thing keep being amazing if you can
30:50 because that's what he was and you know
30:54 what's interesting about it is it's
30:57 funny the irony of this moment right now
30:58 is that I wasn't feeling so great inside
31:00 and kind of get that kind of you're got
31:04 something on you and you're feeling a
31:05 little achy just ever so slightly just
31:08 microscopic
31:10 I'm tired but this just happened and I
31:12 was like man I've recorded some of my
31:14 best stuff when I'm tired and it would
31:19 be logical to go to bed or whatever but
31:23 now I feel fine I'm out here smoking a
31:25 cigar
31:25 no funny it's my medicine but the irony
31:29 is is that I'm doing something that is a
31:32 little hard to do at least at first I'm
31:35 setting this up I don't even feel that
31:36 good when I'm setting all this stuff up
31:38 no I feel fine strange but when I think
31:42 about Larry I think he did stuff that
31:46 wasn't easy and that's why we observing
31:50 him was you know and he has the sisters
31:51 just as amazing as he is that's how you
31:55 get to that greatness is to not give up
31:57 I said a long time ago that I had this
32:00 saying that I had developed for myself
32:02 and probably my late 20s and I used to
32:06 say it's a hell of a thing to be a man
32:08 now of course you could apply it to the
32:10 ladies as well and I'm not saying it's
32:13 not a statement that reflects at all on
32:15 the burden of a woman it's just straight
32:17 up man to man face to face it's
32:20 something you would say to a young man
32:21 who perhaps today is a snowflake and
32:25 needs to not be one and part of it is
32:31 you know we pussyfoot around life if we
32:34 think that there's an easier way out you
32:37 know criminals had a point where they
32:40 were legit meaning they're not doing
32:42 anything criminal to make money and to
32:46 survive and someone promises them this
32:49 easier life so what do they have is
32:52 options right maybe they haven't gotten
32:55 a degree yet and they're looking at that
32:56 whole three to four year run and going
32:59 oh my god really
33:00 and I'm gonna be super duper in debt I
33:01 can just sell drugs on the corner steals
33:03 credit card here or do something
33:05 something right so it's easier to get
33:08 into this cartel crime circuit thing
33:11 sometimes but then immediately becomes
33:14 more difficult than if you just gone and
33:17 done school which is where we get that
33:21 phrase that I was told at 21
33:23 it's easier to take a shorter amount of
33:26 time to do the job right then a longer
33:29 amount of time to do the job wrong which
33:32 sounds like duh what are you talking
33:34 about right that's the dumbest statement
33:35 I've ever heard
33:36 but what it really means is there's no
33:38 shortcuts in life if you want to get
33:41 that goal then you're gonna have to put
33:44 the effort in but you know what's great
33:46 for any of you've ever played a video
33:50 game a console game especially the old
33:52 console games like the old Zelda's from
33:54 the Super Nintendo and you're playing
33:57 Zelda
33:58 there's no cheat codes you got nobody
34:00 next to you that knows how it works
34:01 there's no internet with this easy-peasy
34:04 walk through and you're trying to beat
34:06 the boss and you're trying to beat the
34:08 boss and all of a sudden you figure it
34:10 out you feel stunningly amazing at that
34:14 point and it's this multi-dimensional
34:18 positivity that you feel because you
34:20 feel like you you have skills you have a
34:24 brain you're intelligent you're smart
34:26 but you also know how to persevere you
34:29 know how to manage your anger and so it
34:32 augments you in life the more you can
34:35 have that experience by any means
34:37 I think it's Ross Perot and gene Simmons
34:40 to say you know saving up for something
34:43 you want to buy that you can't afford is
34:46 actually more can be more entertaining
34:51 than getting the object at the end
34:54 because it's a goal you wake up every
34:57 day you know remember how you used to do
34:58 those fundraisers and churches and stuff
35:00 at school and you tell you draw a
35:01 thermometer and you fill it up with
35:03 reading because it goes all the way to
35:04 the top it wasn't that fun when you were
35:08 a kid you go to school and use like a
35:10 canned food drive or something like that
35:12 and and you look at the thermometer and
35:14 it's not quite there yet and and you
35:16 check everybody is everyone brought your
35:18 food in and so you go back home and you
35:19 get more food you know because we have a
35:22 mutual goal I find folks who are amazing
35:29 they just inspire me like that and again
35:33 I don't do what he does
35:35 he doesn't do what I did and what I do I
35:39 guess it's hard for me to talk past
35:42 tense about someone who's past because
35:44 in my world there's no past tense any
35:48 distance he and I had is gone
35:50 you could be right here sitting in one
35:52 of those chairs smoking his pipe
35:54 watching me do this show right I've
35:59 actually had the extreme privilege of
36:02 you know meeting some of you through
36:04 chat
36:05 I believe I shared a story about a
36:09 gentleman that got contacted me when I
36:13 was still doing MKULTRA radio I think
36:15 before even deep thoughts had come out
36:20 but his wife was sick and he had I
36:23 believe two daughters and it was rough
36:26 she been sick for a couple years and he
36:28 and I would Skype and he needed a
36:32 framework like we all do for this moment
36:35 that is seemingly obligatory is going to
36:40 occur she is going to pass at some point
36:42 and it's going to be way way ahead of
36:44 her normal schedule you know a father of
36:49 two and he's got to go earn the the
36:54 bacon as they say and make sure that the
36:59 death of a wife / mother is not going to
37:01 traumatize the children and I guess one
37:04 of the silver linings was that it did
37:06 take a little while to happen so the
37:07 children were sort of prepared but you
37:09 know you could be prepared up to the
37:11 point where you could be prepared up to
37:14 a point and then it exceeds any of your
37:17 expectations and you're trying to deal
37:18 with it and I told him I said look your
37:23 wife's gonna find you the perfect
37:24 partner after she passes so keep your
37:27 eyes open and I remember him looking at
37:30 me like I know you're trying to cheer me
37:32 up but that seems like a little crazy
37:35 and I told the story once before I don't
37:39 think he completed a year after his
37:42 wife's passing before he found the most
37:45 amazing woman
37:47 who loves his children loves him to
37:49 death and I see their photographs on
37:52 Facebook they don't post that much he
37:54 doesn't post much on Facebook because
37:57 he's he's living life he's enjoying it
38:00 now whether or not his wife participated
38:02 in that I unequivocally think yes but it
38:06 happened and he is happy he's reborn I
38:12 talked to another listener who lost her
38:15 father
38:16 way too early and there was a kinship
38:19 between her and I because her father was
38:22 way ahead of all of us this is her
38:26 father was a gentleman who was like wide
38:29 awake in the 90s will hide awake and he
38:33 told her a bunch of things that existed
38:37 in the world that no one else knew about
38:38 and he made predictions that have come
38:40 true but he was taken from her too soon
38:43 and I don't think that I think by the
38:46 time her and I had talked she didn't
38:48 have the she didn't have anyone in her
38:52 life who thinks perhaps like we do where
38:57 there isn't afterlife and it's very
38:58 productive and he didn't go away he got
39:01 closer so we were able to talk it
39:05 through and I think she built a
39:08 framework that got her out of this box
39:11 that she was in I believe she told me
39:14 she was extremely shy in fact it was
39:16 funny we were chatting through chat and
39:20 it was all business you know is all this
39:23 I needed to talk to you about this thing
39:24 and I said well call me here's my number
39:27 I mean she was like huh I don't know you
39:30 know I'm really super shy and and you
39:32 know and I said finally I just pounded
39:34 her one day they should took a leap of
39:37 faith and it worked and a lot of you can
39:41 be these people depends on what you
39:44 believe of course so I'm reaching an age
39:48 where my elders are entering that
39:54 envelope of it really could happen any
39:58 day now
39:59 I probably have three profound jeezum I
40:03 have four profound individuals in my
40:05 life right now barring some bizarre
40:08 accident right with other folks but at
40:11 least have four amazing people in my
40:14 life who have impacted me change in my
40:17 life they could pass any minute and you
40:23 wouldn't be like I wouldn't be surprised
40:24 if I got the phone call that one of
40:28 these four had passed and it's very
40:31 sobering to have that thought process
40:33 and what's really sort of I'm gonna say
40:37 funny about it is that everyone who's
40:40 ever gone before me male or female has
40:44 already lived this before people I'm
40:48 mentioning all their parents are gone a
40:51 lot of them have lost their close
40:53 friends because they have entered that
40:55 envelope and depending on how people
40:57 take care of their health and their
40:58 congenital conditions when they were
41:01 born
41:02 they may have passed in their 50s and
41:04 60s a long time ago I think by the time
41:08 I hit thirty years old my school had
41:11 lost in one way or the other about nine
41:16 people and my graduating class is a
41:19 hundred and five people you know we lost
41:22 people that car accidents we lost people
41:24 to cancer we had at least one suicide by
41:29 that time and it's just sobering isn't
41:33 it life is precious you know I I do
41:41 believe in reincarnation but that
41:45 doesn't mean that I believe that life
41:47 should just be some some video game
41:50 where you're running out and getting
41:51 killed and then you're reborn you run
41:52 out and you get killed and you know
41:54 reborn I think if that's what life turns
41:57 into then you're gonna be in a perpetual
41:59 return sequence
42:01 I'll get back down there and actually
42:03 accomplish something oh I will dead
42:07 there's parts of the world right now
42:09 that are
42:11 again they've been in wars for thousands
42:14 of years for old debts that in their
42:17 mind can never be paid their their
42:20 elders raise them right into those debts
42:23 and so they immediately are raised into
42:27 hatred and they go get themselves killed
42:30 so what's interesting to me is based on
42:33 my definition of reincarnation or we're
42:37 trying to better our soul we're trying
42:41 to understand this human condition that
42:43 we're in this particular form of life do
42:46 I think there's other forms of life oh
42:48 yeah oh yeah forms of life we don't even
42:51 understand and we might be able to
42:52 conceptualize them if we had someone
42:55 gift us with maybe a little hint here
42:56 and there for those of you who believe
42:59 the world could be a matrix you're the
43:02 engineers of those other concepts those
43:05 other possibilities and what's
43:08 fascinating is Hollywood television
43:10 they're just creating one show after
43:13 another where you know another dimension
43:15 is part of the part of the storyline so
43:20 we're we're raising our consciousness to
43:23 accept these other ideas but let's just
43:27 say there's an area of the world where
43:28 again they are just you know the average
43:30 age is 35 because by the time they reach
43:34 25 or even 20 they've got a gun in their
43:37 hand and they are out there engaging in
43:40 absolute warfare so you would think that
43:44 that part of the world in terms of the
43:45 age of souls would be very young because
43:49 you could come back 20,000 times which
43:52 is a lot of years but if you never live
43:56 beyond aggression and hatred and
43:59 intolerance you don't get a you're not
44:02 really accomplishing much so get back
44:04 down there so I feel like one of the
44:06 most privileged things for all races
44:09 creeds shapes and sizes of human beings
44:12 because when you get to live in a first
44:14 world country that's where the
44:18 privileges forget what race you are you
44:22 get opportunity that no one else gets
44:25 I'm going to take advantage of it you
44:27 really extend the the full spectrum of
44:30 what you accomplish as a human being you
44:32 really do understand empathy and
44:34 sympathy and all the emotions on the
44:38 emotion table and the other good thing
44:41 if there is a silver lining to these
44:46 sort of shocking little experiences
44:49 where you get that phone call and I have
44:52 to say this might be other than like my
44:56 grandmother and my grandfather passing
45:01 it was a second group of folks because
45:02 they were 10 years younger than my
45:04 previous grandparents my father's father
45:09 passed away when I was like a few months
45:11 old so I held me thank God he got a
45:15 chance to meet me at least symbolically
45:19 but you even if someone is sort of well
45:23 at least there's there are some
45:24 thresholds but if they're a fairly
45:27 normal person okay everybody has flaws
45:32 you know everybody has wonderful
45:34 strengths about them and that sort of
45:36 thing when you have one of your stars
45:42 pass even if you don't have I'm gonna
45:45 I'm gonna do the the other one next you
45:48 get to relish in their character and how
45:51 much joy they brought to other people
45:53 now maybe due to illness they may have
45:56 been a little cantankerous in the last
45:57 few years of their life but you know
45:59 what happens that gets forgotten because
46:03 we know that's not who they really were
46:05 that might have been due to dementia or
46:07 Alzheimer's or something like that you
46:09 know who knows you could you could be
46:10 completely sane but the pain of however
46:14 these individuals pass could cause them
46:17 to be a little less engaging perhaps the
46:20 complete opposite of that well my
46:24 grandfather passed on my mom's side I
46:27 remember the day that I got the phone
46:29 call my mother was definitely sobbing on
46:31 the phone and he was a you know he was a
46:37 cowboy
46:38 kind of guy man he you know he farmed he
46:41 did oil wells he had businesses and the
46:45 family had money on that side of the
46:48 family but he had some brothers and you
46:52 know before everybody entered the other
46:54 realm they had kind of screwed him over
46:57 I guess for some of the some of the
47:00 spoils of the family's wealth and so the
47:04 other two brothers managed this is the
47:07 store anyway they managed to hoard a
47:09 fair amount of the money and so he was
47:12 always kind of monotone for a lot of his
47:17 life and I definitely saw this as a kid
47:20 and I remember the day I got the phone
47:21 call I was sadly busy you know I was in
47:26 my own life I was taking care of
47:28 something in the house I was working at
47:30 home and I know that my sympathy and
47:33 empathy for my mother's condition was
47:36 not appropriate and it was at that
47:40 moment in time I was kind of like well I
47:43 remember saying something to this effect
47:44 I said well you know he wasn't terribly
47:48 happy towards the end so maybe this will
47:52 put his soul to rest you know and I'm
47:54 not sure if I was correct about that to
47:56 be quite honest part of me had no idea
47:59 he was that close to death - that was
48:01 the one of the shocking realizations
48:06 when I heard that but then I went back
48:08 to my brain and he finally woke up and I
48:11 realized you know every time I would
48:14 visit him in Kansas because I used to
48:17 stay at my grandmother's house cuz ain't
48:18 like five bedrooms and they're only
48:20 taken up one I would watch Johnny Carson
48:24 with my grandfather and it was a such a
48:29 special time to be with him he would
48:32 always have a can of planter's peanuts I
48:37 got that right usually the honey-roasted
48:41 kind with the salt on them you know but
48:44 he also have Spanish peanuts but he
48:45 don't make us a sandwich at night he and
48:47 I both make me a cheese sandwich which
48:50 is kind of funny
48:51 he was this master candy maker too crazy
48:55 used to make Snickers in a in a pan you
48:59 know he cut all I'll be crepe butter
49:02 butter brickle it just all kinds of wild
49:04 I mean so he had some staples that
49:06 everyone makes and he had some stuff
49:07 that no one ever makes used to pickles
49:09 own cucumbers to make the house stink
49:12 for weeks and weeks but after he passed
49:16 and I really started to think about it
49:18 and one what's so strange about it is
49:20 there's some expressions I make in the
49:23 mirror or I'll see it in photographs
49:27 where I see his face in my face and it's
49:31 stunning because I also see my father in
49:33 my face I see my mother's blood line in
49:35 my face it's really strange I'm like
49:37 this crazy multi-dimensional face
49:38 sometimes my brain is playing tricks on
49:40 me what I use that face app very
49:43 application on your phone which will aid
49:45 you or make you young or make you a girl
49:49 or make you whatever I either like it's
49:52 amazing I look exactly like my father in
49:54 some photos and others I look like Chevy
49:56 Chase it's really strange without the
49:59 cleft chin but now I think back on my
50:02 grandfather and he he's the one that
50:04 took me out we learned how to you know
50:07 carve wood to whittle you know to make
50:10 ducks and all kinds of stuff and then I
50:14 used to go out with him on his oil well
50:16 runs and so I got sort of that rustic
50:19 Kansas things before I left high school
50:21 and go figure he was a writer but he
50:26 never sat at a typewriter and typed he
50:29 had a recorder and I heard him recording
50:32 a couple times and then I've listened to
50:34 some of the tapes I think I only
50:36 mentioned this one time in the 450
50:38 episodes that are out there but he was
50:41 good I mean he he loved to read western
50:44 books Western history books Western
50:46 fictional books really old ones ones
50:49 that written yesterday so I always get
50:51 him a book for Christmas and he really
50:55 must have digested this stuff because
50:57 the romantic descriptions he put
50:59 together was mind blowing because I have
51:02 this stoic grandfather
51:04 who didn't seem to exude any emotion in
51:08 that spectrum at all like it was an
51:10 incapability of his and then I heard
51:13 this one passage he wrote I was trying
51:15 to get the family you know it's always
51:18 funny it's the aunt and uncle that will
51:19 that's the biggest procrastinator on
51:22 planet Earth
51:22 always says I have to have everything I
51:25 have to have all the photos I have to
51:26 have all the recordings because I'm
51:27 going to digitize them and then they
51:29 never do and then they lose them right
51:32 but he must have hours and hours of this
51:35 one story he was running but there was
51:36 one part in his story if I have it right
51:40 it was a campfire situation at night
51:43 this girl's there and a guy's there and
51:45 he described the mental thoughts that
51:49 the man had towards the woman and it was
51:51 just the most endearing description
51:54 you've ever heard very proper you know
51:57 the way that a man treated a woman in
51:59 the 1800's which is completely different
52:02 than any of the movies you ever see what
52:06 was it I mean I've read how brothels
52:09 work back in the day and it was nothing
52:12 like we ever hear about in the air see
52:15 on film or television you had to act
52:18 proper to even enter one of these places
52:21 and it cost a ton of money and you had
52:25 to you had to get bathed very quickly
52:27 and sometimes they'd make you bathe that
52:28 different location so when you came in
52:30 you smelt great one of the services they
52:32 would offer is to get bathed by a woman
52:35 and but I think though there was a
52:37 famous madam that would made you because
52:40 the bathtubs are tiny right so this is
52:42 not like your bathtub
52:44 but you had to line the bottom of the
52:49 bathtub with gold coins and it was there
52:53 was two ways you could do it you get in
52:55 there and then they will you know do
52:57 your hair and you know whatever they
52:58 could scrub down but there's no private
53:00 part stuff you weren't allowed to swear
53:02 but the other one was that you could I
53:05 think wash up woman's shoulders that was
53:07 the big high but you'd pay like you know
53:10 hundreds of dollars to do this little
53:13 experiment you know so you hear it all
53:16 the time you hear those
53:18 raises of when someone loses someone
53:22 people in facebook say it all the time
53:24 they say you know appreciate those
53:27 around you before they pass because
53:31 you'll never get a chance to tell them
53:32 anything again with that feedback loop
53:35 now obviously if they go the other side
53:38 they're sitting right next to you they
53:40 can hear everything you're saying and
53:44 I've never said it but I probably
53:46 shouldn't say you know some people will
53:49 take that literally and they will think
53:51 that you know you're in the bathroom
53:53 after you've eaten some bad food and
53:56 they're sitting there with you you're
53:57 you're making love to your spouse and
53:59 they're sitting in the room with you I
54:00 don't think that's the way it works okay
54:02 I think they've got plenty of things to
54:04 do but when you want them there
54:06 they're capable of being there now that
54:10 you do they have other preferences
54:12 probably just time constrain them I
54:15 don't know what if everybody tips like
54:17 be with me be with me be with me maybe
54:20 there's a way to pull it all off who
54:21 knows maybe not
54:23 is it a defense mechanism to deal with
54:26 death it was up until about 2008 or 2007
54:33 one of those whatever that year was in
54:35 Disneyland then it became extremely
54:38 extremely real I think the sad thing is
54:42 is that you know depending on where you
54:46 live if you have this privilege then you
54:48 are truly truly privileged and I envy
54:51 you in a really positive way but you
54:55 know when you move away from home and
54:58 like okay so I said there's four people
55:01 in my life that are you know candidates
55:05 to go next right to live more than 1,800
55:11 miles away from me and to live here in
55:13 Los Angeles
55:15 well Los Angeles is a big place and you
55:20 have to earn money to live here and so
55:22 you have to work and you have to fit
55:24 things in and they have their schedules
55:26 and you have your schedules and so you
55:29 can't just
55:31 go to their house all the time you need
55:33 to probably see you know go away kid you
55:35 bother me right so you're sitting there
55:38 forced to deal with it to deal with the
55:43 absence of being able to be with them
55:46 you got to live your own life and
55:48 probably one thing that prepared
55:52 prepared me for this later stage of my
55:53 life would be having moved to California
55:57 17 with no relatives out here at all I
56:00 got used to not seeing my relatives for
56:04 a really long period of time and then
56:07 when they passed I'm never there and so
56:11 if you do have the privilege of living
56:13 in the same town with all of your
56:16 friends and all of your elders these for
56:18 the most part then take advantage of
56:21 that because that's super cool now
56:24 probably the the drawback of that
56:28 privilege is that you will be closer
56:31 than ever to those individuals and so
56:34 when they pass it might be far more
56:36 painful then if you had some miles and
56:41 some hours between you you know you know
56:44 I played video games obviously for many
56:48 many years and I think it was I think it
56:53 was World of Warcraft we you know I
56:56 belonged to a guild which had you know
57:00 at one point hundreds of members when
57:03 people used to play the game
57:05 I've actually been dabbling in it again
57:08 but someone passed away once and our
57:11 guild and I don't think I knew the
57:15 person at all I don't think you know I'm
57:17 obviously probably fought battles with
57:19 them and all that kind of stuff but
57:21 someone would send out the message you
57:23 know so-and-so passed last night and
57:26 it's like obviously this person is young
57:29 and so you're like whoa what happened
57:31 and it starts to shock you into one
57:36 living your life to the fullest but to
57:38 making sure that again you do take
57:41 advantage of all the time you have with
57:42 individuals you know
57:45 this particular time if things go as
57:48 planned you know this video is being
57:52 recorded before my father knows and I
57:56 have agreed to tell him you take a
58:00 little bit of burden off the family and
58:04 that's gonna be the very first time in
58:05 my entire life that I've ever told my
58:07 father that someone in the family has
58:10 passed especially someone as close to
58:12 him as his first cousin so that's gonna
58:16 be an interesting experience for me he's
58:18 asleep right now I tried to call him but
58:20 he's long long in the snooze world now a
58:25 bunch of you have been right there
58:27 beside your relative when they leave
58:29 this world some of you have been the
58:31 very first person to find those
58:32 individuals so you're way ahead of me on
58:36 that scale of dealing with this sort of
58:38 thing you know I don't know if I believe
58:42 in any definition of heaven because it
58:46 just seems a little naive I'm gonna
58:49 spend my whole life in this one realm
58:50 behind this wall eating all day long or
58:53 doing whatever right it's funny because
58:55 most devices that a human being has I
58:57 don't know if it's technically allowed
58:59 in the Christian definition of heaven so
59:01 I don't I don't necessarily believe in
59:02 that but I do believe in the other realm
59:06 and it's interesting to MMM romanticize
59:11 the notion that when a good person
59:14 passes that that world just got enriched
59:18 and it's happening every second of every
59:21 day right has I've made this recording a
59:23 bunch of wonderful folks have crossed
59:25 over but it is an interesting thing and
59:30 of course he has family on the other
59:31 side already and so they get reunited in
59:36 my mind which i think is a wonderful
59:39 thing I think one of the biggest
59:44 mysteries that is preserved for a man
59:47 which is potentially why we don't have
59:50 like instant access to these individuals
59:52 and any type of ghost state or spirit
59:55 state
59:56 as I think the afterlife has I made an
59:59 episode on that if you want to really
60:00 deep dive in that if we knew that we
60:04 renewed we may live this life way too
60:08 carelessly and we'd miss the point of
60:11 being alive and so it's just weird
60:15 catch-22 where we might say if we
60:20 believed in the afterlife a hundred
60:22 percent as I do you'd say well it's a
60:26 shame that they left especially if they
60:28 left early but they're not in a bad
60:32 place even if they were completely off
60:36 base in this world there's some horrible
60:40 person they don't take that with them
60:43 that was this little experience maybe
60:47 they're taking a hit
60:49 maybe they chose to be that person
60:51 because they'd never been a bad person
60:52 before and that's just part of the Q
60:54 continuum experience it's a it's a weird
60:58 notion to think about I am firmly in
61:05 this body I am firmly convinced that our
61:07 goal is to become as balanced as we
61:12 possibly can as human beings and the
61:15 guiding forces as hippy as it might
61:18 sound it is love I mean that is what
61:20 we're trying to do is to understand love
61:22 to gain as much of it as we can by
61:25 putting out as much as we can I think
61:28 that's all I got on that one I just want
61:31 to share that experience because there's
61:33 not too many opportunities I have in
61:35 life to share something that's very real
61:38 time with you I'll try to get this
61:41 episode out shortly I have managed by
61:45 the way to rid myself of almost all of
61:49 my backlog I've got a couple that I need
61:53 to watch and see if I think they're good
61:54 enough to go out but most of them all
61:56 out now so we're now past all those
61:58 summer episodes - maybe one or two and
62:03 this is where I have to say if you think
62:06 you're subscribed to this channel in
62:07 YouTube and
62:09 then you better go check because they
62:12 keep unsubscribing folks because you
62:13 could be getting this from the website
62:14 and you could get this from Facebook or
62:18 Twitter and if you haven't subscribed it
62:20 will definitely make sure that you don't
62:23 have to remember the channel if you are
62:26 a person that likes notifications on
62:27 your phone I am NOT one of those people
62:29 you can click the bell I never do
62:31 I don't even click the Bell in my own
62:33 channel just so you know so don't feel
62:35 guilty and there's miss possum right
62:38 there apparently this possum right here
62:41 Oh possum was back in one of the shots I
62:44 think of the video that's what's wrong
62:50 with movies no Dovie do games of video
62:53 games today I think it's the episode and
62:56 she shows her little face back here in
62:58 the background one of our listeners
63:00 caught it hilarious like it's a I don't
63:03 look in the comments because they tell
63:05 you the exact minute to go to it it's
63:08 it's fabulous it's really great so I
63:10 finally got that shot I don't have to
63:12 swing the camera around to make it
63:13 happen but if you haven't been to deep
63:15 thoughts radio.com that's where you can
63:17 get totally hooked up with the show
63:18 again understand this shows a variety
63:21 show so you're gonna have videos that
63:23 you love and videos you're gonna skip
63:25 don't feel guilty don't feel angry just
63:27 don't watch it it's cool the goal of
63:29 this show is to rebuild humanity from
63:32 the ground up that's what the show's
63:33 entire charters about and passing you
63:36 know we have to create a virtual
63:39 community in my opinion because it does
63:41 take a village to raise a person as
63:43 cliche as that is today that's saying
63:45 and so this is my version this is what I
63:47 know passed on to you guys my opinion
63:51 does change over time but you know I
63:53 just remastered the whole first season
63:56 and re-uploaded all the videos to bit
63:59 shoot so I got a chance to look at some
64:01 of the old videos and you know I think
64:03 overall except for my evolution in
64:06 science I'm pretty much the same guy so
64:09 hopefully that works for you guys but on
64:12 the website is two links for the video
64:13 two links for the audio remember just
64:16 visit the website on the device you want
64:18 to have your podcast and then you click
64:21 the link in a lotta Mac
64:22 linked to your software so that's super
64:24 cool but there's two links for the
64:27 social media which is really Twitter
64:30 it's just the links to the video
64:32 I don't tweet much and then Facebook
64:34 which is a full-blown community of
64:36 amazing people I mean everyone's amazing
64:39 we have two great moderators Kaz and
64:41 Dave we take care of everybody so super
64:44 big thanks to them I don't say that
64:46 enough I do apologize gentlemen but
64:50 there's two other major ways of donating
64:52 to the to the page I use your money to
64:55 pay for cigars mainly and and just to be
64:59 fully disclosed the site see patreon is
65:05 about 35 bucks that's what I make a
65:07 month the YouTube channel averages is
65:11 about almost 50 bucks a month so that's
65:15 what I'm making off this whole thing
65:16 I've had some people get really
65:18 concerned about me going after any
65:20 revenue and it's like look if you
65:22 thought I was a shill I wouldn't need to
65:24 ask for any money because they'll be
65:25 getting cheque from George Soros right
65:27 go see my episodes on shills if you have
65:31 any doubts there there's two other
65:34 affiliate links one is the brief browser
65:37 yeah it's you just need the brave
65:39 browser man it blocks all that crazy
65:43 tracking it blocks all the videos from
65:46 auto-playing it blocks all the
65:47 advertising so you save boatloads of
65:50 time and if you're on CNN or Fox or
65:53 whatever your outlet is Amazon doesn't
65:56 know that's the cool thing about it
65:58 Facebook doesn't know so you block all
66:00 that sort of you know five eyes deep
66:03 state cross-stitching and it removes
66:06 their ability to build a profile on you
66:08 and then sell it to what is it Cambridge
66:11 analytics so we cut Zuckerberg off right
66:14 at the neck it's great but the other one
66:17 I keep pitching to you guys because it's
66:19 a product I just want you guys to have
66:21 it's called Backblaze there's a link on
66:22 the website I have a little philia thing
66:25 I never earned a penny from it I don't
66:28 even know how that works with them but
66:29 it's 5 bucks a month to computers
66:32 infinite drives it updates all night
66:34 long so your stuffs up there
66:36 it is utterly say my bacon a couple
66:38 times so get up there and get a copy of
66:40 that if you haven't already if you have
66:43 sensitive information and really the big
66:45 sensitive stuff because we don't print
66:47 our photographs that's where you need
66:50 your stuff backed up these your photos
66:52 because I mean if your house burns down
66:54 just think about it your your house
66:56 totally burns down you're unable to save
66:58 any of your computers are you cool you
67:01 have a backed up somewhere you want
67:02 Dropbox drop boxes what is it twelve
67:07 bucks a month's for the professional and
67:08 you don't get as much space you can
67:10 infinite space on Backblaze that's
67:11 what's cool so be smart the other one is
67:16 that receives in one has been fully
67:17 remastered it is not on this channel
67:19 anymore because they're the originals if
67:21 you've embedded it anywhere it'll still
67:23 work if you want to see all the videos
67:26 in Channel and the first season or any
67:28 any video that is having problems being
67:31 viewed on YouTube just go to [ __ ] shoot
67:33 search on DTR EP and then the episode
67:36 name or number and they'll find it also
67:39 with brave when you get the brave
67:41 browser down switch the search engine to
67:43 DuckDuckGo at least in 2019 that's an
67:47 alternative to Google you cut them off
67:49 duck duck goes complete commitment to us
67:52 as they're not tracking us and they are
67:55 not selling our stuff because they have
67:56 nothing to sell so it's another way of
67:58 getting off the grid of the deep state
68:01 you know looking you up in some Patsey
68:05 database to finger you at some other
68:07 point for something else just keep them
68:08 totally blacked out as to who you are as
68:10 individuals
68:11 I am sorry there's no decent alternative
68:14 to Facebook I have thought about
68:19 creating a very moderated locked area I
68:23 don't mean moderators and censored but
68:25 membership moderated sort of community
68:28 on the website I just think it's a
68:31 little slow because it gets utterly
68:33 pounded because that's where all the
68:34 mp3s are stored so you know maybe give
68:38 me a vote on such a thing would you like
68:40 to get completely off Facebook and go
68:42 behind a closed door on the website and
68:44 talk and then maybe we'll will hook that
68:46 up it's easy enough WordPress is
68:48 becoming out
68:49 amazing in my opinion but anyway take
68:54 care of yourself and someone else go hug
68:56 somebody and tell how much you love them
68:58 and I'll see in the next deep thoughts
69:00 over and out
69:02 [Music]
69:04 [Applause]
69:05 [Music]
69:10 [Applause]
69:15 you
