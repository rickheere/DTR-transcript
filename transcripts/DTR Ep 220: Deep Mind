00:00 [Music]
00:32 back ladies and gentlemen on this
00:37 finally summer afternoon today we're
00:43 going to talk about something I'm going
00:44 to start calling the deep mind and we're
00:48 in a family together right on this show
00:50 that's what we have if you're a you know
00:53 habitual listener it's because you and I
00:56 share something we have deep minds now I
00:59 don't ever want to say that in the
01:02 pretense that we're better than anyone
01:06 else
01:07 some people are tall some people are
01:09 short they're advantaging advantages and
01:12 disadvantages to either classification
01:15 right for those of you with deep minds
01:19 you understand that it's a curse as well
01:21 as it's a gift
01:22 a person who's ignorant might not know
01:25 that they live in a blissful world
01:28 because they don't pay attention to all
01:30 the things that are recognized as either
01:32 good or bad but sometimes when they need
01:36 to program that computer VCR radio
01:40 inside their car they're ignorant
01:44 becomes costly they must pay someone
01:47 else to do it they never quite feel
01:49 under control they fear car repair
01:52 places because car repair places can
01:54 figure out how much they know and brake
01:56 the car every single time it goes in and
01:58 there's this constant dependency but for
02:04 us we're going to push all that aside to
02:06 worry about any judgments and need that
02:07 kind of stuff and let's
02:11 talk about what it means to have a deep
02:14 mind and how do we identify a deep mind
02:16 and how do we deal with having a deep
02:19 mind how do we attain more depth how do
02:22 we control the dive right none of us
02:25 wants to go all the way to the bottom of
02:26 the ocean just because we dope in but
02:30 some of us will feel that way
02:32 won't we now for some of you you know
02:37 you've had a level of awareness that's
02:39 been around since birth and you can't
02:43 remember not being aware of your
02:45 surroundings it doesn't mean your
02:46 academic intelligence was you know at
02:48 some high level but you were simply
02:51 aware that you were alive you started to
02:54 see the variables of life very quickly
02:56 you will most likely have felt the
02:59 mortality and frailness of your parents
03:01 and yours in your Guardians that they
03:04 were just people too you may have seen
03:07 the society that you live in as sort of
03:11 a crude one-size-fits-all DMV line that
03:18 lacked any personality any
03:21 personalization and so you went your own
03:25 way because you're like I just can't do
03:27 it I just can't stand in line I need
03:31 government cheese I'd rather starve if
03:35 you're prone to be in this deep mind
03:37 arena then you most likely know that you
03:43 think differently than other people
03:46 perhaps you have a photographic memory
03:49 and I want to make a point here
03:52 photographic memories are misunderstood
03:55 because people who don't have it or
03:58 haven't recognized that they have it
03:59 think that what we're saying is
04:01 everything's pictures like supposedly
04:05 you could look at an album cover
04:06 ten years ago memorize it and then ten
04:08 years later you could draw it that's not
04:10 what photographic memory means in its
04:13 most extreme form it just simply means
04:15 that in certain metrics of information
04:18 it could be numbers could be letters to
04:19 be phone numbers could be images it
04:22 could be history
04:24 give you mathematics engineering all
04:25 these different things when you look at
04:27 something you completely take it in and
04:31 it's it becomes it's not a matter of is
04:36 it difficult to remember it is that it
04:40 is difficult to forget and that's why if
04:44 someone feeds you if you have that
04:45 talent if you have that sort of genetic
04:47 capability or whatever I knows how it
04:49 happens then if someone feeds you bad
04:52 information it could be very dangerous
04:54 because you have a problem for getting
04:57 the first impression of that information
04:59 you'll hear me say that on the show and
05:01 most people I think have this anyway
05:03 regardless of how intense their memory
05:05 is but that sets the foundation for the
05:09 ability to take in information at an
05:12 amazing pace because instead of taking
05:16 it in and then pushing it into a storage
05:18 facility and trying to associate it with
05:19 things that you have no problem
05:20 remembering such that when you think of
05:22 the Christmas tree you think of the fire
05:24 truck you think of a the eggnog whatever
05:27 that little chain is right it's
05:30 automatic it's automatic because it's
05:32 just what happens to you once you have
05:37 that foundation the second tier up that
05:40 usually is indicative of the mind that
05:42 can do this is that you see connections
05:46 most of you folks have seen sort of a
05:48 neural net map or even a diagram of
05:53 nuclear fission where you have one
05:55 little round dot that separates there's
05:59 a two lines coming off of it to two
06:00 other dots and then each one of those
06:02 comes out to two and see the exponential
06:04 growth pattern in your mind you can do
06:08 this with information except that each
06:13 connection from one thing to another is
06:15 based on sort of a court case evidence
06:18 that must be submitted to your mind to
06:20 make that connection make sense it
06:24 doesn't mean you can't connect things
06:25 that you can't prove it's just there's a
06:26 gigantic question mark when you say I
06:28 don't know how these two are connected
06:30 but they're connected the third thing
06:32 that you'll notice inside your mind is
06:34 that you have a
06:35 an internal clock a processor and it is
06:40 moving a lot faster than other people's
06:42 clocks and it doesn't matter how fast
06:45 you speak how fast you walk some folks I
06:49 know do gigantic round robins in their
06:52 minds and they're super slow physically
06:54 on the outside but by god you could ask
06:56 him any question planet Earth you know
06:59 there was a friend of mine that made a
07:03 joke about the creator of TurboTax the
07:05 actual Michael Morgan who invented it
07:07 and he's a very tall gentleman and just
07:11 extremely wise at least in computers I
07:15 don't know him on a personal level but
07:17 he they said you know you could ask him
07:21 what to put what sorry what one plus one
07:23 is and what the answer to life the
07:24 universe and everything is and he'll
07:28 take the same amount of time which would
07:31 be a long amount of time to answer those
07:33 new questions and both of the answers
07:36 will be right I thought that was cool
07:39 because I've known people like this but
07:43 if you do have a rapid-fire mind without
07:46 drugs or are sick before drugs
07:50 what is if happening is is that you
07:53 start to analyze things on levels that
07:55 others don't there's more attributes
07:58 about something for instance for those
08:02 of you are just trying to figure out
08:03 exactly what I'm saying here cuz I'm
08:04 coming at it from different angles if
08:06 someone said you know what do you think
08:09 of the house and you say well it looks
08:10 really nice and you go why do you think
08:12 it's nice and you start and labeling
08:14 things well I love the two-story thing I
08:16 love the color I love the driveway each
08:18 one of those things that you're
08:20 complimenting about the home is an
08:22 attribute of the house and so when your
08:25 mind moves very very quickly you can
08:28 look at tens of thousands of these
08:30 things in a very conscious way not a
08:32 subconscious way right we all do it
08:35 subconsciously whether or not we want to
08:37 admit it or not I'm not sure that your
08:39 intellectual IQ has anything to do with
08:43 your ability to stop your mind for
08:47 thinking subconsciously now some people
08:48 get hit on
08:49 they have you know various disorders and
08:52 they may or may not lack the
08:55 subconscious ability to analyze things
08:57 once your mind moves very quickly and if
09:02 you have those other two layers the
09:04 ability to remember well the ability to
09:06 connect things and remember them well
09:08 once you start analyzing the world
09:12 you'll start living in your own sort of
09:15 microcosm of cause and effect of this
09:19 view of the world you will live in an
09:22 enlightened state because at all times
09:24 on average you're seeing more than other
09:27 people in every little nuance of life
09:31 now you know I'll say a little
09:34 digression here you know they'll people
09:37 that will say that you everyone has a
09:38 purpose in this world everyone has a
09:40 talent that needs to be exploited and
09:42 sometimes you don't find it and so
09:44 therefore you don't find your destiny I
09:45 think there's probably some truth to
09:47 that and I think that for some folks
09:50 without any exceptional you know
09:55 memorization talents or those other
09:56 layers they do have this ability to see
09:58 one thing really really well you know
10:01 that's why we go into professions a guy
10:03 who is a body shop guy who fixes cars
10:06 you know how these you have these
10:08 friends that say look how the paint
10:09 doesn't match between the quarter panel
10:11 in the door and you sit there and stare
10:12 at and you're like I don't see any
10:13 difference oh my oh come on it's right
10:15 there debt it up they have that
10:16 exceptional ability to see what you
10:19 can't see for whatever reason they got
10:21 better eyes so they just somehow can
10:23 analyze the data better in that
10:25 particular realm so you will always find
10:29 folks and I think virtually every human
10:31 being has a talent like that in a
10:33 particular category but a deep mind is
10:37 going to see it almost all the time and
10:39 everything that happens so let's move to
10:42 the next stage let's say that you have
10:44 these talents you've got part of this
10:47 foundation but for whatever reason it's
10:51 not something you've consciously thought
10:52 about although you can feel it and never
10:54 once tamal at age you and maybe
10:56 sometimes it is your disadvantage
10:58 because you're overanalyzing stuff how
11:00 do you
11:02 get your hands into it right how do you
11:04 sink the Eagle talons into the flesh of
11:07 this issue and control it and nurture it
11:11 maybe pull it back a little bit in some
11:13 areas or floors put the pedal to the
11:16 metal as long as you're going in the
11:18 right direction and you've navigated
11:21 your obstacles or you have the ability
11:23 to navigate the obstacles that are
11:24 coming at you it doesn't matter if
11:26 you're traveling one mile an hour or at
11:28 light speed it doesn't you'll just make
11:32 it to your destination faster the only
11:34 thing that you risk by moving too
11:35 quickly through life is not taking in
11:39 the experience right what would be the
11:43 point of being born as a baby and then
11:45 within the next 60 seconds you die just
11:49 like in the finality of 2001 a Space
11:50 Odyssey you're an old man dying with the
11:52 monolith in front of you you kind of
11:54 intellectually know you live the whole
11:56 life that you were supposed to live in
11:58 that one minute but you know you missed
12:01 it all 99.99% you missed the whole
12:04 journey who were you at the end well
12:06 you're not quite sure you can look at
12:07 your hands you can kind of see what a
12:09 tire you're wearing I must have been a
12:11 dignitary oh I must have been a rock or
12:12 whatever was right so we owe it to
12:16 ourselves to see life happen and to
12:19 enjoy it the good and the bad let's go
12:24 back to each one of these layers here
12:26 now in terms of memory in general you
12:30 know I'm just going to lightly mention
12:32 go see the episodes related to health
12:37 the toxin episode because the first
12:42 thing you have to do is stop putting
12:43 poison in your body that's really all
12:46 I'm going to say go watch the episode
12:48 for all the things that are toxins I did
12:50 miss one toxin by the way that I don't
12:53 put on my body which is I do not use
12:55 antiperspirant I use deodorant but I
13:00 unfortunately don't sweat that much and
13:02 I don't have horrible video within 24
13:04 hours at least but we have to make sure
13:07 that we take care of the vessel right
13:09 this symbiotic relationship we have
13:11 which I constantly talk about the soul
13:13 on the body we've got to make sure that
13:14 the body is as clean
13:15 as it possibly could be the second side
13:18 of it is to make sure that anything
13:20 that's that's nagging at you that is
13:25 consuming the electrical circuits in
13:27 your body that keep your vessel in
13:29 communication with the universe have to
13:32 be used according to your specifications
13:35 that sounds really esoteric but let me
13:37 just tell you imagine you had some piece
13:40 of electric appliance a digital
13:42 television and instead of just leaving
13:45 it on the TV stand and playing it you
13:48 take the back off and you just start
13:50 throwing you know tin foil flakes in
13:52 there and you start just crossing wires
13:54 you know you're going to basically
13:56 destroy the television and the reason
13:59 why you know that is that you're
14:00 diverting electricity of places it
14:02 should be putting too much electricity
14:04 from the source to a circuit and just
14:06 popping it you're a very similar
14:10 metaphorical thing to any electrical
14:12 appliance everything that you eat all
14:15 the air that you breathe and metabolize
14:17 into oxygen into your bloodstream it is
14:20 trying to create this battery of
14:22 electricity that makes you function if I
14:27 am sitting there it like the scene a
14:30 Dumb and Dumber Reese's you have you
14:31 ever you want to hear the most annoying
14:32 sound and then they scream that crazy
14:35 sound that is interfering with your
14:38 ability to process electricity in ways
14:41 that are constructive when you turn the
14:44 fan on in your bathroom it annihilates
14:46 probably 50% of your brains power to
14:49 process individual data so if you're
14:51 ever in the morning and you're trying
14:52 and you're getting up in the morning and
14:53 you're trying to analyze information
14:55 because you're about to start your day
14:57 there's just something that's
14:58 interesting you're thinking about right
15:00 and you turn that fan on you're going to
15:03 be struggling it's like running through
15:05 water to keep that consciousness as
15:07 detailed and refined and as
15:09 three-dimensional as it could have been
15:11 has you lift the fan off now I
15:14 understand a lot of us have fans that we
15:16 don't turn them on the whole place turns
15:18 moldy we just keep that in mind when
15:20 that thing's on you are pausing your
15:22 ability to absorb information you can
15:25 open a window and find a different way
15:26 to exhaust that all the steam I'm
15:28 serious
15:29 it's a it's a big deal depending on how
15:31 you manage your morning's you find the
15:34 people who listen to car stereos in the
15:36 morning have much shallower existence
15:40 because the one they're getting
15:42 programmed by the radio the media you
15:44 know sort of in kala trip box but it's
15:49 also blasting music at you or sound or
15:51 talk radio or whatever and maybe you
15:54 know if you listening to a blog or
15:56 something like that it's it's
15:57 stimulating your mind but just chattery
16:01 advertising and music whether or not
16:02 it's great music or not you're you're on
16:06 vacation from intellectual [ __ ] believe
16:09 me you want to turn that stuff on when
16:10 you've had too much you've had so much
16:12 that your brain hurts and you're tired
16:14 you know go ahead and turn the music on
16:15 wake yourself back up a good time I
16:17 think you know what I'm saying
16:19 so once you've reached a point where
16:23 you've detoxified and you're policing
16:26 the interference circuits in your mind
16:27 and a human being could be an
16:29 interference circuit someone is just
16:30 chattering at you wasting your goddamn
16:33 time
16:34 telling you stories that have no endings
16:36 all that kind of stuff something is no
16:37 value just filter it all out and then
16:39 you'll have a chance to start organizing
16:42 how you put memories inside your mind
16:45 the thing I always tell people is
16:48 everyone has a certain level of
16:50 photographic memory - an accident - some
16:53 drug overdose that might have blown out
16:55 your mind getting hit on the back your
16:56 head - those those very specific events
16:59 and ones like them when I ask you about
17:03 your childhood
17:06 usually you have a photographic memory
17:09 that's engaging to recall your childhood
17:12 you see the first memory that you have
17:15 because that's why you call it your
17:16 first memory you see being in a crib
17:19 when you're young or walking you know
17:21 awkwardly through the living room or
17:23 when you're on the swing set and thing
17:25 hit you in the face or whatever it is
17:28 you have a photographic memory my advice
17:32 to you is to take that amazing mechanism
17:36 that you're using to tell me about your
17:38 childhood or whatever era of your life
17:41 right and realize that's the same
17:45 warehouse that you're going to put
17:46 everything else you learn and you know
17:50 if I said hey what was it like to be in
17:52 fifth grade and you have you know some
17:54 memories of fifth grade it doesn't
17:57 matter if I ask you when you're 25 or 85
17:59 you know as long as you don't get
18:01 sniffed too many clouds out of planes
18:03 you'll be able to recall it oh yeah I
18:07 remember that teacher oh she was great
18:09 da da da da da okay why is that so
18:12 effortless why is recalling being a
18:15 certain age so effortless but when I say
18:17 you know when was a Lincoln shot what
18:21 was the Civil War now obviously you're
18:24 only gonna remember things that are
18:27 interesting to you and it's because you
18:30 want to recall that it's fun to you
18:32 right you know if you had a good date in
18:35 your life for someone you want to
18:37 remember that one if you've had a bad
18:38 date you want to forget that one so it
18:42 doesn't have to always have to be some
18:43 huge peak or valley but there's just
18:44 information that's interesting to you so
18:49 I said it on several episodes but the
18:51 very first thing you want to start
18:52 practicing to either control your deep
18:56 mind or to make a deep mind within
18:58 yourself because there is not a person
19:00 who's hearing me right now the gate they
19:03 can't achieve a deep mind everyone can
19:06 do it you just have to understand what
19:08 that is on a basic level and then move
19:11 into it I'm just covering absolute DUPLO
19:14 level steps here right big giant Legos
19:17 as well I'm going to talk about in this
19:19 episode
19:20 barely going to get to any fine-tuning
19:22 stuff let's talk about information
19:26 intake as it pertains to memory because
19:29 that's a big deal how do you take in
19:33 data
19:34 I once fell for a speed reading thing on
19:40 television in the 90s it was this guy
19:43 that you know said he could read pages
19:44 really really fast and I bought his
19:47 little wonderful it was a cassette tape
19:51 something like that it was a workbook
19:53 and stuff and he did shake out of me or
19:58 shake into me she got to be a bad way I
20:01 was looking at data input and put into
20:03 me a new way of thinking about how to
20:04 put in information into my mind I
20:08 personally have a belief that linear
20:10 reading is the most atypical method of
20:12 taking in data that human beings could
20:15 ever be exposed to and that means
20:17 reading left to right or right to left
20:18 however you do it but reading
20:20 phonetically in lines is not natural for
20:23 the brain because in nature very little
20:27 nature applies that way right we take in
20:30 things and a 210 degree in frustum of
20:34 information about everything plus we
20:36 have there are other four senses that
20:38 are taking information right
20:41 if you don't bless with brush or
20:43 fluoride you'll get a sixth sense of
20:45 your third-eye feeling the world more
20:48 Gnostic input channels but what he
20:52 taught me was that you don't exactly
20:55 have to look directly at a word to
20:59 absorb it you can look at a paragraph
21:02 and move your eyes in a small circle and
21:05 believe it or not your mind is so
21:07 brilliant it grabs the whole paragraph
21:10 puts it in your brain and deciphers and
21:12 reads it for you and so if you're
21:14 looking for the gist if you need to skim
21:16 a document quickly and you do not have
21:18 the time to ingest it you can use this
21:22 technique now there's more English
21:24 techniques you can use which is to read
21:26 the first sentence and perhaps the last
21:28 sentence of every paragraph if you
21:30 really needed to get more you know
21:31 scientific knowledge someone's going to
21:33 be asking you
21:33 more detailed information about it you
21:37 know if you're doing it for yourself you
21:39 can skim if you're going to take a test
21:41 or be questioned about the information
21:42 you better read the first and last
21:43 sentences but that's just a little trick
21:46 of editorial organization the first
21:50 sentence is the reason why the paragraph
21:51 exists right the only reason why I tell
21:54 you that is that there are different
21:56 ways of taking in information much
21:58 quicker again most people have figured
22:00 out that YouTube is an amazing
22:01 University there's just a million people
22:04 making videos about absolutely
22:05 everything now you know usually nine out
22:08 of ten aren't aren't your voice they
22:10 aren't the way that you would want to
22:11 hear information once you find the
22:13 person the category you're trying to
22:14 learn speaking or videotaping things in
22:17 a way that your brain really works well
22:19 stick with that person subscribe to them
22:21 and listen to everything that they have
22:23 and then you'll get whatever discipline
22:25 you looking for right I'm going to give
22:28 you an example of taking in data that
22:32 should be pretty interesting when you go
22:34 to the movies and you see a professional
22:37 image fill some of you know this some of
22:41 you don't but you're obviously looking
22:43 at several different mediums coming
22:47 together several different senses coming
22:49 together to create a fictional story in
22:51 front of your mind at the most basic
22:54 level someone wrote a script that is a
22:57 story and before the thing was ever
23:00 turned into anything before it was cast
23:03 20 sets are built sound design comes in
23:06 there's a story and those words on paper
23:09 if it's done properly are so utterly
23:12 compelling and powerful that I guarantee
23:15 you the first three pages of that script
23:17 it's not the first page was so on target
23:20 if someone in Hollywood greenlit the
23:23 film it doesn't mean that's what you
23:25 actually see when the film gets created
23:27 because there are ignorant directors
23:28 that have no writing background and
23:30 there's folks [ __ ] with things but
23:33 there's something about those works they
23:35 were chosen there are people in
23:38 Hollywood they do nothing but write
23:39 dialogue you know and a particular move
23:41 you might have seven different people
23:43 rehashing the dialogue to make it more
23:46 appealing
23:47 the masses or to shrink it down only
23:49 pill to one sector which is extremely
23:52 rare what's the next layer up the next
23:56 layer up is really creating the visuals
23:58 and this is created by obviously casting
24:00 a whole group of actors that seem to
24:03 work with the story picking locations
24:05 that actually work with the story
24:07 building out individual rooms and
24:11 buildings and cars and whatever the hell
24:13 needs to be made for this particular
24:14 film they're choosing the palette almost
24:17 like the colors you know in a palette
24:19 when you become a painter and then they
24:21 film it people say the words there's a
24:24 little bit of recording going on and for
24:26 sound most the sound though the third
24:28 layer gets made by sound specialists who
24:31 are doing musical scores they're doing
24:33 the fully work where they're doing all
24:36 little tiny sounds they do audio dubbing
24:38 for a lot of the voiceover so you get
24:42 this other dimension
24:43 and those three things are coming
24:47 together to give you the single stream
24:50 but you might say is a movie I saw this
24:54 movie but the average person doesn't
24:58 separate all three and there's way more
25:01 than three dimensions I'm just keeping
25:02 it really simple you know there's the
25:05 story the eyeballs and the ears I want
25:09 you to think about this analogy when you
25:11 think about the information you take
25:12 into your life or take from life into
25:15 yourself to be categorized and filed
25:17 away for hopefully a useful use or you
25:20 know whether or not be entertaining you
25:22 source an academic thing or you're just
25:24 a research or trying to put put
25:26 connections together you can't just take
25:30 the grilled cheese sandwich and say this
25:32 is a grilled cheese sandwich it's two
25:35 pieces of bread some butter and some
25:37 cheese see it at a more intense level so
25:41 that you can keep the attributes
25:43 separate in your mind and use that as a
25:45 mechanism to incorporate and correlate
25:49 connections right I'll give you an
25:52 example because we're the next layer
25:54 we're going to go up to is talking about
25:56 how you can hone your connection
25:57 mechanisms right I think I mentioned it
26:00 the other day
26:01 there is there was a show on television
26:03 called connections a long time ago as
26:05 this British guy who did these brilliant
26:07 jobs and of connecting stuff and what he
26:10 would do is he trace back history using
26:12 connections of inventions that stood on
26:15 the shoulders of other inventions so he
26:17 got all the way back to the beginning
26:18 where he would say you know finding a
26:23 quartz rock turned into a radio and at
26:28 it you know at the geological
26:29 fundamental level you're just digging a
26:31 piece of quartz rock out of perhaps the
26:32 Grand Canyon and then you think about
26:34 how the most advanced radio system in
26:36 the world they'll rely on a little piece
26:39 of quartz to pick up a signal to do a
26:41 little piezo effect right so here's why
26:43 we have to do that movie thing if I said
26:48 to you we have an illness that is going
26:52 around and you say well what are what
26:55 are the symptoms well it's weird you
26:56 know when people eat a certain category
27:01 of food and drink this water they are
27:03 okay but if they drink a soda they get
27:06 sick right and see we go well I can see
27:10 that I can see the cause right away it's
27:12 the soda now you know what but we've
27:15 also they get sick when they drink
27:17 orange juice mint orange juice and soda
27:19 have nothing to do with each other right
27:22 the way that these you know scenarios
27:26 work in life or people trying to find
27:27 cures or trying to find the bug in
27:30 something is that they're obviously
27:32 taking all of the players in the
27:35 experiment and what they do is they
27:38 explode them and imagine like sort of a
27:42 computer graphic where you might have
27:43 like a car and someone does a computer
27:46 animation where they yank all the parts
27:49 away from each other so every nut and
27:51 bolt and washer and wire and seat cover
27:54 and everything is all floating kind of
27:56 away from the center to the point that
27:58 you could just sort of walk around it
27:59 you know on a VR headset you can see
28:01 every single tiny unique piece no two
28:05 pieces are allowed to stay connected
28:06 they have to be pulled away from each
28:08 other
28:09 that is you
28:12 being able to see every attribute of the
28:13 car and when you explode things like
28:17 that in your mind you are then capable
28:18 of looking at a different device perhaps
28:21 a you know a stealth fighter it's got
28:24 the same exploding pattern and you say
28:27 hey there's some weird correlation these
28:29 both these machines are experiencing the
28:31 exact same weird bug see if you can find
28:34 it and immediately in your mind you're
28:35 like well I know what I'll do I'll find
28:37 the parts that are in this car that are
28:39 also in this stealth bomber
28:43 but if you don't explode things into
28:46 attributes into little unique distinct
28:48 discrete pieces you will have no hope of
28:51 making efficient connections right now
28:56 there are on the subject of connections
28:59 there are obviously plenty of conspiracy
29:02 theories all over the internet and we
29:08 tend to gravitate to those narrator's
29:11 that have more knowledge about the
29:14 respective sciences and obviously the
29:17 ability to filter out pop science but
29:19 just to come at things from the most
29:20 beautiful myopic sort of Occam's razor
29:24 approach to everything where you cut
29:26 away all the crap that is irrelevant and
29:28 whatever's left that you must accept or
29:30 deal with or filter right the problem is
29:34 is that a lot of these folks will be
29:37 able to create more beautiful videos
29:39 because we spend a lot of time cutting
29:40 and pasting other people's content they
29:42 have nice voices but they have very
29:44 little knowledge or they're stuck in
29:47 religious paradigms and so you're trying
29:48 to solve for a very non religious thing
29:52 and you can't get out of it but the
29:55 problem is they've created such a
29:56 mousetrap for your brain of pleasantries
29:59 its pleasant to look at it's pleasant to
30:01 listen this person's voice that you get
30:03 trapped in it it doesn't mean they're
30:07 trying to manipulate you that doesn't
30:08 mean they're evil it just means that you
30:10 have to be careful about how you take
30:12 information in but the quality of your
30:14 brain taking in connections is going to
30:17 be high if you could do it yourself
30:19 versus having to take someone else's
30:23 advice about the connections
30:25 one of the reasons why on this show I
30:27 attempt to always slow down time and
30:30 pull everything apart and explain things
30:33 in the way that I think that well I
30:35 think you know obviously I experience in
30:37 this way but maybe you too is so that I
30:39 can say look this isn't really my
30:41 opinion about something this is how I
30:43 experience it personally and if you
30:45 experience it personally in the same
30:46 manner then perhaps this is why we're
30:49 unique or alike right but the other
30:53 thing about connections it's real
30:55 important is you must have the courage
30:56 to be wrong but the beautiful thing
30:59 about finding out that you're wrong
31:01 typically means you've also found out at
31:03 the exact same time that now you're
31:04 right isn't that interesting right so I
31:09 was talking about the neural net
31:10 connection model right I think it's
31:13 pretty easy to understand you know if I
31:14 said someone connected you know
31:16 gunpowder to a nuclear bomb it's not a
31:19 big stretch how you can see a bunch of
31:22 little connections that go back to make
31:24 that happen it's just the way it works
31:25 right let's say you have a set of
31:28 connections in your mind that has been
31:29 true for you up to this point and then
31:32 you found because you exploded something
31:35 a little more efficiently you found that
31:37 when you look at things with more parts
31:39 and pieces you found a contradiction in
31:40 your own theory now you still may have
31:43 indicators beyond that point that makes
31:46 sense right we're missing all of the
31:48 bones that would that would suggest that
31:50 there's a you know direct correlation
31:52 between monkeys and humans there is no
31:54 evidence that that's the case there
31:56 isn't there's an insinuation because
31:59 there are similarities but there's no
32:00 direct proof which is why we call it the
32:02 missing link right but once we get to
32:06 Homo Sapien sleeping we can then look at
32:09 how we've evolved and make analysis
32:11 that's correct and we can also go back
32:15 to the hominids and cave animals and
32:16 monkeys and see how they put together or
32:19 how they're put together but to mix it
32:20 together it doesn't work but now if
32:23 you're an evolutionist who pulls your
32:24 head out you will go to your
32:26 anthropological research and find out
32:28 there is no proof yet that the two are
32:30 connected so you found out that you're
32:32 wrong so the little little connection on
32:35 the circuit has to be broken because
32:38 you don't have proof if you really talk
32:41 to intense anthropologists they will
32:43 absolutely convince you there's no link
32:45 on a genetic level despite the
32:46 similarities right but what you've
32:48 immediately done is clarified the
32:50 connection map and your brain you now
32:53 know where you were wrong great Willie
32:56 you know sometimes there's only one
33:00 other choice or two other choices it's
33:02 either/or when you have an either/or
33:04 you're in a blessed situation because
33:06 you just flicked the switch to the other
33:08 node and then you're right then the
33:11 information in your brain is cool and
33:14 refreshing and true now it's pretty rare
33:18 that there's just a binary choice but it
33:20 does it does happen I just want you to
33:22 feel that inside your mind and that when
33:25 again one more in software and you find
33:27 a bug it's it's when you're a rookie
33:30 it's a humdrum hang your head low
33:34 shameful moments when you're an adult
33:36 doesn't matter how old you are but in
33:38 your mind when you become a pro at it
33:40 it's a joyous occasion because you can
33:43 now go find a buggins question and then
33:45 your stuff is just that much tighter but
33:48 now let's go to the advanced level of
33:51 this conversation how many times have
33:54 you been afraid because you're at a
33:56 physical location in your life where you
33:58 felt like you were in danger feeling
34:01 like you're in danger is usually the
34:03 result of having things be out of your
34:06 control you're in a rowdy nightclub
34:10 you're coming out of a concert and
34:12 there's a rowdy parking lot you're by
34:15 yourself and it's dark at a location of
34:18 which you've never been so you have no
34:19 memory or suggestion as to where the
34:22 steps are where the you know one over
34:25 the cliff is and so you are saying this
34:29 is frustrating that I'm scared because I
34:32 know how to handle information if I have
34:36 it if I knew who was too drunk in the
34:39 parking lot to deal with and who was not
34:42 too drunk to deal with I would simply
34:43 navigate a path in my brain a bunch of
34:46 waypoints to get to my car around the
34:48 crazies
34:50 you would turn the light on in the house
34:52 that's dark you'd carry a torch to
34:54 supply more information so you'd know
34:56 where you are you feel me right okay
34:59 the beautiful thing about intellectual
35:02 exploration of any subject matter you
35:04 might get involved in whether it be your
35:05 own little tiny thoughts you don't need
35:07 a youtube video you do not need a web
35:09 page and you don't need a book to just
35:12 sit lie down be by yourself drive a car
35:16 and just have your mind accelerate down
35:19 some crazy Doctor Who tunnel of which
35:23 it's terrifying and exhilarating all at
35:25 the same time the beautiful thing about
35:29 amusement park rides is they're
35:30 constructed to be exactly this to
35:33 provide a visual escape so you no longer
35:35 feel like you're at a particular
35:36 location besides the theme park that
35:39 you're at and you can trust them that
35:41 there's not a bunch of you know blood
35:43 dripping off of the rails and ambulances
35:46 or paddy wagons taking the people who
35:47 died before you you're safe and so
35:51 that's what we pay for
35:52 you know they spend anywhere from 250
35:54 million to a billion dollars on some of
35:56 these rides so that you and I can have
35:58 these incredible experiences well you
36:02 can do this with your research in your
36:03 own mind just make sure you get
36:07 something that's durable I think things
36:09 are more like books are a lot better but
36:11 you're going to want to track what
36:12 you're doing the more that you are
36:13 starting out this process because you're
36:15 going to be potentially overwhelming
36:17 your mind and you might feel like you're
36:20 being forgetful because they're simply
36:22 taking new information putting it in the
36:24 slots that have the previous information
36:26 another thing you can do is get a
36:28 dictaphone or you know get an app on
36:31 your telephone lets you talk to your
36:32 phone and record sequences right you'd
36:36 be amazed at what you can do with your
36:38 mind by simply stacking up what you
36:40 understand today and then going to the
36:42 next level in the next level the next
36:45 level each subsequent day a lot of times
36:51 you will feel there's a push there's
36:56 this almost Gnostic push where someone
36:59 is saying you need to go in this
37:02 direction
37:03 you need to research this you know
37:07 sometimes it'll be you need to move here
37:11 depending on where your life is at that
37:13 moment how drastic it is it's much
37:14 better when you can just set it on think
37:16 that's what your Gnostic instinct is
37:19 telling you but the very first time you
37:22 pursue an instinct inside yourself and
37:24 then you succeed in finding something
37:28 that enlightens you for the rest of your
37:29 life and I'm telling you it doesn't have
37:31 to be a big thing it could be a teeny
37:33 tiny thing and it will totally change
37:35 your life and once you do it by yourself
37:37 without someone you know breathing down
37:40 your neck without an assignment from
37:42 school or from work or for someone else
37:44 you find it just a nugget of truth it is
37:49 so liberating it's so uplifting because
37:52 in the end you did that you were the one
37:56 that discovered that and then you will
37:59 realize you have a talent you probably
38:03 have a deep mind
38:05 well grout you know there's I don't know
38:06 if there's any levels to deepness I'm
38:10 sure there are levels but once you start
38:14 researching and coming up with
38:15 interesting answers to things and
38:17 theories about things because you know a
38:18 lot of times you don't have the
38:20 information to fully conclude but you've
38:21 got a lot of information to get to the
38:23 next level when you hear a Neil deGrasse
38:27 Tyson or a science guy lecture you about
38:30 what truth is there's a huge laugh that
38:34 comes out of your system to say look at
38:36 these guys trying to convince me just
38:38 like preachers who created this fake
38:40 book about original sin so then they
38:43 could extort the relationship out of you
38:45 with money donations and a bunch of
38:48 stuff so that you could get to God right
38:51 that's what these personalities aren't
38:54 eat television you can't access the
38:56 truth unless you go through one of these
38:58 blowhard proxies that is [ __ ] you
39:04 have a hundred percent ability to go
39:06 find the truth by yourself or with a
39:09 group of people that are like-minded
39:11 open-minded good memories good
39:13 connection mechanisms and good powers of
39:16 deduction once they get there
39:17 now let's talk about the the act of
39:21 talking to someone else who has a deep
39:23 mind like you I will tell you that in my
39:31 own experience of really diving deep
39:33 into thinking and existing and
39:35 researching and concluding and
39:37 theorizing and correcting all this other
39:39 stuff that I can have conversations
39:42 conversations with individuals that are
39:44 rewarding on a sort of a an incidental
39:47 level because I like people of all walks
39:50 of life you know but there are people
39:54 that I talk to like my writing mentor
39:56 rice sit down and have a deep
39:59 conversation and I will tell you that it
40:03 is like you know you've seen light bulbs
40:08 when the power is kind of going up and
40:09 down and the filament has just enough
40:11 electron current to be illuminating just
40:17 a little bit you can kind of see you
40:18 turn all lights out it could barely see
40:20 that the filaments on and that's you
40:23 talking to someone that's not really
40:25 contributing much to your overall
40:26 purpose in life but when you talk to
40:29 someone who's deep like you that bulb
40:33 turns on and it turns bright and it
40:35 turns into the Sun you can't even see
40:37 the bulb anymore you're just seeing a
40:39 big ball of light and contrary to the
40:42 way light bulbs work where they're built
40:43 to blow up this thing just keeps getting
40:46 brighter and you feel amazing your chest
40:48 feels amazing and when I get done
40:50 talking to him my mentor I feel like
40:55 I've been alive for the first time in
40:56 days if not weeks if not months I just
41:00 want to sit there all day
41:02 and just we can talk about absolutely
41:04 anything but when we do we just jump in
41:07 a metaphysical level of all thinking you
41:10 know studying it's about film you know
41:13 studying all the genres that have been
41:15 popped out lately
41:17 we'll talk about the generational
41:19 uniquenesses between age brackets and
41:23 people have had certain experiences and
41:24 then we get into sort of the
41:26 philosophical level of a particular
41:27 script it just is wonderful
41:30 it's creative it's not what we're not
41:33 living in a world of complete unknowns
41:35 we're actually comparing our knowns or
41:37 our opinions about the knowns
41:39 the reason I want to sort of close
41:42 closer to this community discussion is
41:45 that and most of you know this because
41:47 you well I'll say this much for those of
41:50 you who are strictly on the podcast
41:52 solution for this particular show and
41:55 you get most your information a podcast
41:57 I'm going to suggest that you may live
41:59 in a more isolated instance of taking
42:03 information in and there's nothing wrong
42:04 with that if that works for you you
42:06 don't have to have a bunch of buddies
42:08 and bunch of friends you may be a person
42:13 who doesn't like being without you know
42:14 you get nervous around other folks or
42:16 whatever because you're so analytical
42:17 being around them is too much for you
42:19 that's fine if you may experiment if you
42:22 don't have those limitations and kind of
42:24 getting out and talking to folks right
42:26 and maybe just talk to one other person
42:28 it crowds bother you that's fine just
42:30 talk to one other person and you'll find
42:33 that the amount that you can get from
42:36 two people is really it's an order of
42:39 magnitude it is you to the power of them
42:41 then to the power of you right it's like
42:45 two times two you know ten to the power
42:48 of ten is more than ten plus ten so it's
42:51 not just the two of you you are
42:53 multiplying times each other it's crazy
42:56 for those of you on YouTube typically
42:59 most of you at least chiming ever wants
43:01 to whomp on a comment in looking for
43:04 some sort of validation some sort of
43:06 communing with someone else's like you
43:09 and for those of you get really into it
43:11 and comment you know it you just you
43:14 drive the show you give it a backbone
43:18 now there is a sort of cautionary tale
43:23 that comes with the deep mind it has
43:26 been one of the the most acidic patterns
43:29 in history when it comes to folks that
43:33 achieve deep minds and how they are
43:36 received by the world and I you know
43:40 obviously didn't live in these eras
43:42 but it can be a little alarming that the
43:45 prize for being informed or analytical
43:51 perhaps you could say smart is that the
43:55 mob can feel intimidated and the mob can
44:01 turn against you turn against those who
44:04 have labored to become intelligent labor
44:07 to become enlightened to see more now
44:11 sometimes it's endorsed by the native
44:13 culture you know Dresden Germany was a
44:17 location where they said that you know
44:19 most of the most artistic interesting
44:23 thought-provoking thinkers of the world
44:25 had sort of congregated to build a city
44:28 where it was a city of deep minds that
44:32 work together and again there was
44:33 musical disciplines mathematical
44:34 disciplines writing disciplines
44:36 everything that was considered amazing
44:39 and unique about humanity was in that
44:42 city and they firebombed the [ __ ] of the
44:44 place destroying it and at the same time
44:47 destroying a lot of the intellectual
44:50 genetic pool of Germany now there may be
44:55 a little bit of romance to that tale
44:57 than truth I wasn't there but I've heard
45:00 that from several different sources in
45:02 my lifetime
45:04 the Chinese under Mao tse-tung they went
45:09 after everyone who was intelligent and
45:13 farmed up reasons you know first I think
45:16 was the landlord's that got murdered and
45:18 then it was just
45:18 anyone who made another person feel
45:20 uncomfortable they could do the Body
45:22 Snatchers point and you were rolled out
45:25 into the street and beheaded in front of
45:28 gigantic crowds that were so happy that
45:31 the bell curve on the test - just gone
45:34 down considerably and now China is
45:36 paying the price for that today as they
45:38 try to reengineer creativity from a lost
45:42 era like no one would no one would ever
45:45 contest that China had the most had
45:49 sorry at least a really good set of
45:51 creative human beings putting together
45:53 architecture their art
45:55 the Dragons their rituals their burial
45:57 rituals their marital rituals but my
46:01 friends who live there my friends who
46:03 visit there and my American expats who
46:05 lived there I'll say that it's a pretty
46:08 decent conversation that for the last 10
46:10 20 years they've been trying to get
46:12 Europeans and get Americans over there
46:14 to teach creativity and they're getting
46:18 it they are getting it there's new kids
46:20 out there but they're not able to
46:22 monetize it as much into the stream of
46:24 China because China is so controlled by
46:26 its government right and the agenda of
46:28 China's government is obviously much
46:30 more functional military than creative
46:32 or it's more industrial industrial but
46:36 you have leaders like Pol Pot right he
46:39 killed everyone because they had glasses
46:42 and he just thought people with glasses
46:44 are more intellectual I don't how bad
46:46 eyesight makes it smart but but that was
46:51 his philosophy and he killed them off
46:52 and this has happened over and over and
46:56 over again and how does it happen well I
47:00 can only person think of two possible
47:02 scenarios one is serendipitously happens
47:05 that people get smart and people don't
47:07 people get deep people don't people see
47:10 more people see less it's all just
47:12 happenstance just happens I can't vouch
47:17 for that one the only one I could have
47:20 ouch for is people who learn things
47:23 covet they hold their information in to
47:28 make sure that no one else gets ahead
47:30 and then you have room for the rationale
47:35 of getting rid of people that do that
47:39 you know the people that run the world
47:41 have a lot more answers to things than
47:43 we do we know they do we suspect that
47:47 there are you know serums and injections
47:50 for nearly every single element in the
47:52 world that they have access to that they
47:55 labor to create that they hoarded and
47:57 coveted okay and we're not very happy
48:03 about that as deep thinkers right if I
48:06 could give you a little red button and
48:08 you push that and everyone
48:09 coveted and hoarded information away
48:11 from society had a cardiac arrest and
48:13 died I bet we could fire a lot of takers
48:16 to push that button because then we get
48:20 the information released to us
48:21 supposedly some some mechanism but the
48:26 solution the real solution for this deep
48:30 line commitment is to do what you can to
48:33 encourage people to think now one might
48:39 think okay well really really one of the
48:41 best things you could do is to get kids
48:42 to think and I would say yes that's
48:44 actually probably the very best thing
48:45 you can do but by god until a cup
48:48 hits the road with their own feet paying
48:52 their own bills getting their own thing
48:53 together they don't affect the world as
48:56 much as adults do adults write articles
49:00 and newspapers they stand in front of
49:03 teleprompters they start giant companies
49:06 they make youtube videos that people
49:09 listen to because I guess with age comes
49:11 credibility so it's really splashing on
49:15 everyone because it's all part of a
49:18 movement part of an idea and ideas are
49:21 very hard to kill I'm going to bring
49:23 back an analogy that should help sort of
49:25 separate the exercise of thinking and
49:27 not thinking going deep or not going
49:30 deep working in these areas to give
49:33 yourself more depth and not doing it and
49:37 it's all in moderation right you can't
49:40 just sit and think and think and think
49:42 probably at Einsteins level or Tesla's
49:44 level forever you know you got to take a
49:46 break every once in a while go lay out
49:48 by the pool the analogy I came with a
49:51 long time ago it seems to work really
49:52 really well is that there are two types
49:54 of people or I should say two states of
49:57 mind I should say more than types of
49:58 people that we get into think of a
50:02 concert a musical concert of any kind
50:05 that you like the performers are up on
50:08 stage they have labored to bring you an
50:11 experience they've learned how to play
50:12 their instruments perhaps there's a
50:14 vocal in there perhaps there's a story
50:17 attached to it and then there's the
50:19 spectators that are in the audience
50:22 that are enjoying the fruits and the
50:24 bounties of these performers on stage
50:27 now we know that the performers on stage
50:30 don't sit up there forever they learn
50:34 something they play it they go off in
50:36 practice and then they go to concerts
50:38 themselves and they sit in the crowd and
50:40 they watch their other friends play and
50:42 it's this beautiful circle of taking
50:44 turns of entertaining each other right
50:48 I'm going to suggest on an intellectual
50:51 level on the thinking level on a depth
50:53 level this is what we do or on stage we
50:58 are looking for something new we're
51:00 trying to go deep we're trying to
51:01 reanalyze again studying all the
51:03 attributes of something finding
51:05 correlations memorizing them trying to
51:08 determine whether or not we need to
51:10 change some of the little logic gates in
51:12 our minds now this wasn't right to get a
51:14 better results when I go here don't
51:16 worry about personal judgment in the
51:17 middle of this experience who freaking
51:20 cares right you imagine how funny it
51:24 would be if you had sort of a MacGyver
51:26 or macGruber depending on which one
51:28 you've seen in your lifetime where the
51:30 guy is trying to create a solution out
51:31 of you know the hodgepodge crap in the
51:33 house you know it's like give me a
51:34 paperclip a rubber band and a cat and
51:37 I'll get this safe unlock sort of thing
51:40 right what if the comedic reaction was
51:46 that the second the guy fails he goes
51:48 into such a self-loathing you know death
51:53 spiral of feeling like he was a loser
51:56 that he talks to himself and goes into
51:58 his full psychosis about himself and
52:00 doesn't continue moving forward with
52:02 trying to disarm the bomb and then he
52:05 dies right it's like a depressed
52:08 MacGyver or something that seems silly
52:12 hopefully to you and it should seem
52:13 silly for you to persecute yourself for
52:18 getting anything wrong in life like I'm
52:20 just researching who cares a genius
52:23 finds what's wrong and their own belief
52:25 systems and their own philosophies and
52:27 whatever documentation they were given
52:29 and the documentation they create on top
52:31 of that the algorithm of haves and
52:34 have-nots
52:35 is a real one it's manipulated at some
52:38 points in time and it is real and other
52:42 points in time we have to make sure that
52:45 information that we gain is freely
52:48 accessible accessible from anyone that
52:51 wants the information and I think once
52:53 you feel confident at a certain level
52:55 with the information you have certain
52:57 that you've discovered up to a certain
52:58 point try to get into a forum where you
53:01 can share it because as much as you
53:04 might say well it's my idea I don't want
53:06 someone else you know figuring out the
53:07 last part of the equation and I lose my
53:10 fame well today with the internet you
53:12 can definitely prove that you got it all
53:14 the way up to a certain point and you
53:15 will get credit you know there's a
53:17 reason why Nobel Prizes are handed out
53:19 to multiple men at the same time and
53:22 women at the same time because they as a
53:24 group moved at the different levels
53:26 stood on each other's shoulders until
53:27 someone looked over the wall and said
53:29 there it is DNA you know I think that's
53:33 it I hope you fill me on this one it's a
53:37 little shy of an hour that's fine I hope
53:41 it's obvious that this stuff is really
53:43 important that we improve the mind of
53:47 man try not to believe any story or any
53:53 claim that you're not supposed to be
53:55 intellectual because God is in some
53:57 pissing contest with man I watched this
53:59 video the other day that was just the
54:00 most god-awful insulting video to any
54:05 notion of a creator where this guy was
54:07 trying to read the Bible to everyone to
54:08 say you see what happens when it's a
54:10 tower of babel right you see what
54:12 happens when man tries to challenge the
54:13 wisdom of God it tries to learn how God
54:16 works or be smarter than God God comes
54:18 down and punishes you man that's an IQ
54:23 test everyone's failing if you believe
54:25 that [ __ ] again remember my
54:28 commitment to not being a trivial human
54:31 being to follow that notion stay stupid
54:36 that's what the Bible says stay stupid
54:37 and this is only certain people's
54:39 interpretations mind you it's absolutely
54:42 not the very technology that this guy
54:44 used to go through YouTube right would
54:47 not have existed because
54:48 could have demonized learning about
54:50 electrons you don't want to learn how
54:52 God does what he does man this is purely
54:58 secular between us and the universe and
55:01 each other try to leave it as a
55:04 primitive beautiful thing and you will
55:07 live a charmed life
55:10 deep thoughts radio calm for all the
55:12 feeds there's video for an audio audio
55:14 if you're on video there's a locked
55:15 Facebook group if you're interested it's
55:17 on iTunes it's on vid me and it's on
55:20 Google Play so get up there and take a
55:23 look remember deep thoughts radio that's
55:25 the distinction take care of yourself
55:27 and someone else and I will see you in
55:28 the next detox
