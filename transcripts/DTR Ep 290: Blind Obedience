00:00 [Music]
00:34 ladies and gentlemen today we're gonna
00:37 talk about blind obedience I just came
00:43 back from the car wash okay I had to get
00:45 some new tires in my car it's when these
00:48 car washes where you drive through nice
00:51 soft automated car wash on your car and
00:53 then you pull through and you can pull
00:54 in these stalls and you get to vacuum
00:56 and rub down your car do whatever you
00:58 got to do and I'm backing out because
01:01 I'm done and I have to wait for this
01:05 woman to back out before me and she gets
01:09 in front of me down the alleyway to exit
01:12 this whole thing as she's been rubbing
01:15 down her car longer than me she was
01:17 there when I got there and she left just
01:20 as I left I look up and she still has
01:23 the blue tape on the back of her car and
01:25 I'm thinking wow for whatever reason
01:30 that blue tape is an authoritative
01:32 procedure to washing a car and whatever
01:35 reason she doesn't think she can take it
01:37 off but she totally rubbed down the
01:40 outside of her car and stared at that
01:42 blue tape over and over blind obedience
01:47 every time you've been in a public place
01:50 there's a double door and there's a lot
01:55 of people going through but only one
01:57 half of the door is actually open and so
02:00 starts bottlenecking people trying to
02:02 come out and go in through the same half
02:05 door that's open and then you walk up
02:10 and you take one split second to examine
02:13 the situation you realize that the other
02:14 half of the door is unlocked and you
02:18 just reach up and open it and walk right
02:20 through but the sheep and the cattle
02:24 that has become our society who doesn't
02:27 think doesn't think and it's blind
02:31 obedience there's only one door open
02:33 therefore we must all go through this
02:35 door no one thinks about the mechanics
02:37 and engineering of how a door works
02:40 Westworld season two I think
02:44 episode one there is a scene where a
02:47 gentleman describes elephants that are
02:51 as big as you know large trucks being
02:56 held down by a little spike in the
02:57 ground and he tells the story about how
03:02 he asked his father how on earth or why
03:06 on earth does that elephant not pull the
03:09 spike out I mean here they can uproot
03:11 trees they could turn cars over
03:13 why doesn't he pull the spike out and
03:16 just run away
03:17 and his father tells him well because
03:20 when they were babies they use the spike
03:21 to hold them in place and they just
03:24 simply learned that once the rope is in
03:26 the ground you can't defeat the spike
03:28 because as a child elephant they can't
03:33 it becomes learned in their brain and
03:37 then it becomes a rule of blind
03:40 obedience this phenomenon is interesting
03:44 because you can see it in the public and
03:45 scoff just like I just did and just like
03:47 chases people open the [ __ ] door
03:49 would you I'm sitting here waiting in
03:51 line because you guys are all morons you
03:53 know a door really there's two sides to
03:57 it just open up the other side you see
04:00 this all the time in malls in baseball
04:05 stadiums and subways I mean it's
04:07 unbelievable the millions of people who
04:11 walk through one half of the door
04:13 because everybody who does it
04:16 automatically flunks the test right you
04:19 walk through one half of the door and
04:20 you're like
04:21 so you didn't see the other half you
04:23 know I mean I guess if there's plenty of
04:24 room you don't need to but if everyone's
04:26 bottlenecked and waiting and time is
04:27 money and life is precious you failed
04:30 the test
04:31 well when you see this kind of thing in
04:35 other people at some point you should be
04:38 asking yourself holy [ __ ] do I do that
04:40 right if you see someone snore it's a
04:44 very interesting thing you have no idea
04:46 of your snore unless someone you sleep
04:48 with tells you bin you snore yeah really
04:51 and you wake up in the morning there's
04:52 no recollection of it necessarily
04:56 that's a little different why do be Dias
04:59 is when you're awake and you can notice
05:02 it if we lived in an absolutely perfect
05:05 world where no one lied and no one did
05:07 any harm getting one blind obedience
05:09 probably be such a big deal
05:12 but we don't we live in a constant forty
05:17 chess game with bad guys and
05:20 unfortunately they know all the rules
05:22 they have all the pieces
05:26 because they've been taught how to play
05:29 this game and we haven't been taught how
05:31 to play the game so we're trying to be
05:33 the bloody rogue who figures it out
05:38 every casino in Vegas is rigged to take
05:41 your money it's mathematically rigged to
05:45 take your money but poker is a very
05:48 interesting vulnerability to a casino
05:51 and poker players know this if you go
05:56 play craps you're gonna lose more often
05:58 than not play roulette blackjack
06:00 anything you're gonna lose you pull the
06:02 one-armed bandit today you're just
06:04 cascading through a microchip with all
06:06 of the wins and losses are already
06:07 calculated it's all predetermined but
06:11 you walk in with poker against the house
06:14 and now it's all up to your head and you
06:19 can actually beat the house now the
06:22 house works really really hard to train
06:24 their house players and there's all
06:28 these video cameras on the table to
06:31 detect something they call counting
06:33 cards right
06:35 what's really funny as they're punishing
06:36 you for being extremely observant smart
06:39 and using your memory with your
06:41 intelligence to play the game better
06:43 than anyone else and there's just this
06:46 threshold of being so good at it that
06:48 you didn't get your ass killed I used to
06:51 have a friend Electronic Arts he would
06:54 go on a routine basis about every six
06:56 months he knew the pit-boss and he'd
07:00 look at him and he you know they'd wink
07:02 and IgG okay I'm gonna take you for so
07:03 much and then I'm gonna stop but I'm
07:05 just gonna keep looking at you to figure
07:07 out when I have out warmed my welcome or
07:09 you know I fulfilled this particular
07:12 session meanwhile you know the house
07:15 makes money off of pretty much anyone
07:17 who loses so the guy's beating the [ __ ]
07:18 out of everybody else
07:19 so the house does make a little bit of
07:21 money the compas room the compas meals
07:23 he stays for three days he binge plays
07:26 you know 1012 hours in a row then he
07:29 goes to sleep for eight hours and then
07:30 comes back in repeats the process it's
07:33 interesting life is a lot like that
07:37 poker player the casino is very much
07:41 like the banking organizations the
07:43 corporations and the government and
07:45 military that follow all the above but
07:48 the casino is the control apparatus
07:53 they're the clean polished we have
07:55 hundreds of millions if not billions of
07:57 dollars to [ __ ] you organization and
08:00 you're the poker player we just simply
08:03 walked off the street with the
08:05 capability in your brain to play poker
08:07 really well and again if you mess with
08:11 their money too much they kill you
08:14 right and what's strange is the Vegas
08:16 police know that that's what happens
08:18 it's not illegal to play poker really
08:21 well it's just you know it's all kind of
08:25 the Wild West out there in Nevada cops
08:29 will just tell you don't do that move on
08:32 man once you get really good at one
08:34 casino they finger you at all the other
08:36 casinos it's interesting I not met a
08:40 poker player and I'm not a gambler I
08:42 think it's a foolish way to waste money
08:46 and I'm not good enough a poker to make
08:47 that work my wall
08:48 I think it's an interesting analogy once
08:51 you understand that you understand us
08:53 those who are not following blind
08:55 obedience I want to make this episode
08:58 because I want to highlight and heighten
09:01 your awareness of things that you accept
09:05 regardless of their logic or benefit to
09:07 you because I allude to things and I'll
09:12 actually be very specific about things
09:14 in episodes but I haven't put it all in
09:15 one big giant bucket one of the things I
09:19 constantly tell you guys is that debt to
09:22 illegal Ponzi scheme banks is the
09:26 illegal debt and therefore any national
09:29 debt that we have to some group of
09:33 banking families across the pond into
09:35 Europe
09:36 well that's ill-gotten gains it's
09:39 illegal and we can't honor that we have
09:42 no national debt to any one banks that
09:47 use fractional reserve banking to
09:49 convince you in a court of law that you
09:52 have been loaned the money for your
09:54 house when they never had the money for
09:56 your house and the only thing going on
09:57 here is that you become a slave in the
10:00 system and actually give the bank the
10:03 money that they were allowed to say that
10:05 they could vouch for due to fractional
10:09 reserve banking now if you borrow 50
10:14 bucks from your buddy
10:15 that's real labour that's real money how
10:18 to give a [ __ ] if that guy is worth a
10:20 billion dollars because he sold some
10:22 startup a long time ago that's his or
10:24 her money you owe them that money back
10:26 if you agree to pay interest well then
10:28 you agree to pay an interest be integral
10:30 pay it back I no longer allow the
10:33 conversation just to come and go around
10:35 me about national debt either be it for
10:39 Europe or us I won't acknowledge either
10:41 one so someone says oh you know Europe's
10:44 20 trillion dollars in debt I just say
10:47 no they're not here not $20 20 trillion
10:50 dollars in debt it was all fake to begin
10:53 with but again someone in France borrows
10:57 50 bucks 50 Franck used to be right
11:01 euros now
11:02 from their neighbor then they owe that
11:04 money we must break off this blind
11:08 obedience because it is perpetuating
11:11 okay the paradigms that keep those who
11:17 have created the paradigm in power
11:21 bankers I mean just think about it just
11:24 think about it for one second here are
11:26 some Rothschild and and there's sort of
11:29 kind of a new family member coming in
11:31 young person taken over and they've kind
11:35 of kept the kid outside the envelope of
11:36 how it really works until that day and
11:39 that person comes in that family member
11:41 comes in talks to daddy Rothschild and
11:43 says you know but daddy if it's all fake
11:50 how are we gonna stay in control and he
11:53 just looks down a big shit-eating ground
11:56 with this crappy British teeth and he
11:57 just says they're too goddamn stupid to
12:01 know imagine that for a second they're
12:06 talking about you you know it's not you
12:09 specifically on this show but you know
12:11 how it works what if there's something
12:13 you're not catching then it is you it is
12:16 me and they actually have a conversation
12:19 about something that you have duped
12:21 yourself with to be controlled to be a
12:24 serf to lose your sovereignty to be a
12:26 slave right and they're talking about
12:32 you and your family and your friends and
12:34 your country and they just say there is
12:37 dumb as a bag of hammers they just keep
12:40 putting themselves right back in our
12:42 system
12:44 and then the young kid goes why why
12:48 don't they see it and he says that's
12:52 just how nature works the elephant won't
12:55 pull up the spike and neither will they
12:59 because they are blind obedience and the
13:04 kid goes Wow and the dad goes yeah isn't
13:07 it awesome we get to have everything
13:10 that life has to offer
13:12 period floating eating children and they
13:18 won't look at us they don't have the
13:21 mental capacities to conceive of the
13:23 crimes that we commit because somebody
13:26 can't be put out to think a negative
13:28 thought the more we do horrible things
13:33 the more the whatever citizen they fight
13:38 among themselves right I was thinking
13:42 about it today that someone's promoting
13:45 net neutrality online again and I'm like
13:47 god damn it
13:48 you know the Patriot Act wasn't a
13:50 [ __ ] act of patriotism right every
13:55 time there's some [ __ ] movement like
13:57 that you take the name you invert it
13:59 then you listen to it and you're like oh
14:01 it's completely [ __ ] and you're like
14:02 yeah why would you call it net
14:04 neutrality because it's exactly opposite
14:06 of that right but now I was thinking
14:10 they always convinced us to kill each
14:13 other right every war is a bunch of
14:16 [ __ ] every war is [ __ ]
14:20 all the laws we pass we passed the
14:24 Patriot Act we passed the military
14:26 commissions Act which gets rid of the
14:27 fourth [ __ ] Amendment of our
14:29 Constitution it's not lawful it's not
14:31 constitutional it's illegal but that's
14:33 what's going on right okay you know how
14:38 do you kill ants what are one of the
14:39 coolest ways to kill ants you get some
14:43 sugar water and there's various acids
14:46 you can put in there it's usually a pipe
14:47 point five percent acid
14:50 and you lay it out wherever ants are and
14:54 they trough to it you put a little
14:56 dotted lines and they all trough to it
14:58 and eat it and take it back to the Queen
15:00 and eventually feed the entire brood so
15:02 much acid it eats their digestive
15:05 systems it kills the queen and you never
15:08 see him again they die somewhere
15:10 wherever they are and they turn into
15:12 dust and you vacuum them up at some
15:14 point but isn't it interesting that one
15:17 of the neatest ways to kill an insect is
15:19 to convince it to kill itself and to
15:22 kill all of its neighbors and to kill
15:24 the mother you gave birth to them
15:28 interesting well we are those ants all
15:33 right
15:35 it used to be hard to find a black
15:37 person too
15:39 in the 90s to see who was born into that
15:42 era the destruction of gangs and drugs
15:48 people like eazy-e woke up and said I
15:51 don't know any black guys in the ghetto
15:53 with passports it's a beautiful phrase
15:56 to say all this cocaine is coming from
16:00 South America all this heroin is coming
16:02 from the Middle East and we don't travel
16:04 there so do the math it's being brought
16:08 in by the CIA it's been brought in so
16:11 that we have an opportunity to create
16:13 millions of dollars selling this stuff
16:15 to each other but primarily the white
16:17 man and we fight over territory we kill
16:20 each other we've got these two gangs the
16:22 Bloods and the Crips and were convinced
16:24 to kill each other in addition to all
16:26 the other turf war so you could have
16:27 blood blood on blood crime because of
16:30 someone fighting over a corner then you
16:33 could have territorial battles between
16:34 it's just crazy but today it's not hard
16:39 at all to find someone from the black
16:42 community to do a video and say yeah
16:45 that was a stupid era in the history of
16:48 our people why people do it a much
16:51 bigger right why people go instead of
16:54 just little ghettos and destroying the
16:55 neighborhoods we destroy countries right
16:58 we pit gigantic religious paradigms
17:01 after each other
17:03 you know where I get all my kill tens of
17:06 thousands why people kill tens of
17:08 millions right so do other nations and
17:12 other races but we're pretty good at it
17:15 all of that is blind obedience here's a
17:21 paradigm here's a paradigm and follow it
17:24 follow it cuz boy I'm telling you that
17:26 you're superior if you follow this
17:27 paradigm and you can also damn everyone
17:29 to hell [ __ ] makes you even [ __ ]
17:30 feel better about yourself right and you
17:33 know eventually we're gonna kill
17:34 everyone else I think every religion
17:37 sort of has the subtextual a theme to it
17:41 which is well you know we'll convert
17:43 everyone up to Judgment Day and then
17:46 Jesus and the angels will come down and
17:48 kill everybody else they'd not only kill
17:50 them take them to hell for the rest of
17:52 their [ __ ] existence that how
17:55 unbelievable who would want to be a part
17:57 of something so goddamn horrible yet
18:02 everyone who dies goes to a wonderful
18:04 place that's what they report now one
18:08 thing I'm not saying in this episode is
18:09 to be some sort of rebel for the sake of
18:11 being a rebel to constantly go against
18:14 everything that's ever worked out in
18:15 society right that's stupid
18:20 there's a reason why I tell you that I
18:22 don't believe Jesus Christ ever existed
18:23 however I tell you it if you want an
18:27 archetype of a wonderful being I know no
18:30 other story the documents are better
18:34 than a fictional tale I believe of Jesus
18:38 Christ I'm sure there are you know
18:43 Buddha was pretty cool but goddamn he
18:45 talked a lot didn't he
18:47 right the amount of information you have
18:49 to read to be a Buddhist it's a volume
18:52 of his teachings it's a book if you go
18:57 to Hawaii you can get a Bible and a
18:59 Buddhist book Buddhist Bible whatever
19:01 and your hotel it's pretty cool so I got
19:05 mine the Christ if you just read the the
19:09 read writing and those old Bibles that
19:11 do that where Jesus's words are read and
19:13 everyone else's words are black
19:15 it is the most abridged version of
19:18 perfection you'll ever find I do think
19:21 the turn-the-other-cheek was written by
19:23 a Rothschild / a Flavius descendent best
19:32 to ensure that you can always get your
19:33 ass kicked but you'll always be
19:37 controllable so we have to find methods
19:40 to exist that do no harm now for the
19:44 lady with the sticker on her car are the
19:45 tape on the back of her windshield wiper
19:47 driving out of the carwash that's just
19:50 an indicator of her docile honest to
19:53 reality right it's not hurting anybody
19:55 it keeps that part of her card dirty the
19:57 whole time which is why I never let him
19:58 put them up with that [ __ ] on my car but
20:00 my concern is that when you see them
20:04 tape it's a it's a larger indicator to
20:08 everything else if you can't see a big
20:10 blue piece of tape on your car and
20:12 understand that that was merely put
20:14 there temporarily to keep your
20:15 windshield wiper from getting yanked off
20:17 by the automated carwash system then
20:20 what else do you not pay attention to
20:22 it's really important it's actually
20:25 little complex like money and slavery of
20:28 all kinds right you know that if you
20:32 have awakened which means you're
20:33 watching this show you have thrown off
20:38 the veil of repression of someone
20:42 telling you how to think and now you're
20:44 making thoughts of your own volition
20:46 you're coming to conclusions based on
20:49 your own desires hopefully you have a
20:51 moral fiber that simply says I can
20:54 either choose to do this or not do this
20:56 let's measure the either one to see if
21:00 it's harming anyone and if it does we
21:05 pull out and see if we can find a
21:07 different way to do it without bothering
21:09 anyone
21:10 perhaps operating completely in stealth
21:12 so no one even knows you're there
21:14 you get what you need or will get what
21:16 you want by the way there's some trash
21:21 collection going on in the house next
21:23 door this house you know I think I told
21:25 you in one episode it was rented by a
21:26 family that destroyed the home and it
21:30 has been I don't know eight months of
21:33 them repairing this place this is crazy
21:37 now there's a flipside to the equation
21:40 that we have to be careful about as well
21:41 which I want to illustrate and I've done
21:43 several episodes and I get done and get
21:45 in my house I'm like dammit you need to
21:46 talk about this other half of the thing
21:48 which is the following let's say that
21:52 the entire world woke up to conspiracies
21:54 and everyone who's ever known anything
21:57 about a conspiracy reveals what they
22:01 know and instead of having just
22:02 anthropologists and archaeologists we
22:05 have folks that are conspiracy ologists
22:09 they go and find all the history every
22:13 nook and cranny of conspiracy that has
22:15 ever existed on planet Earth from
22:18 gigantic 9/11 inside jobs to someone
22:21 embezzling 50 bucks out of the cash
22:23 register in a cafeteria in Omaha
22:25 Nebraska
22:26 it becomes an art it becomes something
22:28 that gets funded with grants and the
22:32 entire initiative is to archive and
22:34 document archetypes of conspiracies such
22:36 that each area of the world no matter
22:38 how how detailed or what-have-you is
22:42 analyzed against this database of
22:44 conspiracy so if we want to say start a
22:47 new business of a particular type they
22:49 go into the database and they find every
22:51 single conspiracy it has ever been
22:53 related to the roles that would make
22:55 this business occur from how the
22:56 investors worked out and Counting people
22:58 work products are purchased from
23:01 manufacturers and put on display how the
23:03 pricing works out of marketing works you
23:06 imagine that that could be a movement
23:09 but at some point al has to settle down
23:12 right because we cannot survive a world
23:17 where we are constantly being suspicious
23:20 of everyone it would have to be a
23:22 ubiquitous thing that's built into
23:24 society well okay let's let's run it
23:27 through the we call it something benign
23:30 like a validation process let's call it
23:33 the cleaning process it's just if you
23:37 want to participate in this you get
23:39 locked into a system that has all the
23:41 checks and balances
23:43 mark my words okay everybody wants their
23:48 life to be private but so much of our
23:52 life is on the internet now that the NSA
23:55 through router duplication they grab
23:59 everything that you do on the net and
24:02 they decrypt it and they save it in a
24:04 database and it just sits there doing
24:05 nothing
24:06 it's aggregated for other kind of global
24:08 [Music]
24:10 consciousness indicators but they don't
24:13 necessary worry about Joe the Plumber
24:15 specifically and so that makes everyone
24:18 uneasy this is how Britain got control
24:20 over all of their subjects and if you
24:23 know under the monarchy over there
24:26 none of the bankers are in charge and so
24:28 the bankers want all the control but now
24:29 they're fighting the military just or
24:31 complex which is fascinating but now
24:34 what if we all agree and I'm not sure
24:38 we'll all agree on this okay I'm sure my
24:40 own opinion is of this let's say look
24:45 because the bankers have invested so
24:48 much in educating the creation of
24:53 terrorists we're talking financial
24:56 terrorists that don't have guns down to
24:57 Isis guys with you know 95 IQs they're
25:01 just stupid and violent and they run
25:03 around [ __ ] killing everybody based
25:04 on some [ __ ] religion they've been
25:06 sold right so the whole spectrum let me
25:10 say okay we need to keep society really
25:12 safe from craziness and we need to we
25:15 need to know when someone is going that
25:17 route they're investigating pipe bombs
25:20 online and it's some
25:22 fourteen-year-old kid and it's coming up
25:25 on 4th of July here in America which
25:27 means the access to gunpowder is gonna
25:29 go way through the roof or we know his
25:30 father buys a lot of black powder for
25:32 his old Civil War gun and this kid's
25:34 probably gonna buy some metal pipes now
25:36 and experiment because he likes to see
25:39 things go boom but of course he's a
25:40 fourteen-year-old kid doesn't know
25:42 jack-shit we looked at his academia and
25:45 he doesn't have any physics so he's
25:46 probably begin stupid and he's gonna
25:50 kill himself or kill his buddies or
25:51 destroy something or become some [ __ ]
25:53 Austin you know package bomber is where
25:57 we get into all that crime prediction
26:01 stuff the Minority Report thing which is
26:05 here already right they're trying to
26:07 launch these systems
26:08 you better believe that just like the
26:11 fake Tylenol cyanide deaths in the early
26:14 80s here in the United States like two
26:18 or three people died of supposedly
26:19 cyanide being laced inside some tylenol
26:23 capsule okay either way I always find it
26:26 fascinating that they kill all these
26:28 prisoners on death row through all these
26:30 horrible chemical injections but
26:32 supposedly you could just take a cyanide
26:35 pill and die so why are you [ __ ]
26:38 electric feeding people why are you
26:39 sticking them full of [ __ ] Drano and
26:41 frying their brains for three or four
26:42 hours just give him a goddamn cyanide
26:44 pill if this shit's so easy The Iceman
26:47 said he used to use cyanide spray on
26:49 hamburgers to kill people so why the
26:51 [ __ ] are we torturing people here take
26:53 your pill say goodbye right crazy but as
26:59 soon as the tiny title tonight
27:01 hey it's pretty cool the tylenol pill
27:04 cyanide thing we're gonna previa it
27:07 tonight as soon as that happened all
27:10 these manufacturers were completely
27:13 ready to insulate bottles all the double
27:17 packaging was Lauda already thought up
27:19 so it would seem just like DuPont
27:21 demonizing freon because they had the
27:24 freon replacement it's all a setup
27:28 right but this predictive thing about
27:32 crime
27:34 is one of these things that I think most
27:38 of you know it's going to be turned over
27:39 to an initiative word artificial
27:42 intelligence just a program is going to
27:45 monitor everything in the world and
27:47 we're going to sanction it because at
27:50 least Jim Bob won't be whacking off to
27:53 your wife and you having sex because you
27:56 happen to have a television in your
27:58 bedroom that has a camera that can be
28:00 turned on at any one point in time we're
28:02 turning it over to a deep thoughts
28:03 computer C Douglas Adams six Tigers got
28:06 at the galaxy he was gonna do all the
28:09 work force its impartial it doesn't get
28:11 turned on by anything you send nudie pic
28:15 to your wife or your girlfriend
28:17 he doesn't care it knows you did it
28:20 because it knows how to parse a
28:22 photograph and see the geometry of
28:23 what's in there but doesn't care second
28:27 that photograph goes to a fifteen year
28:28 old girl and you're Anthony Weiner
28:31 second chair Hillary Clinton and bumaba
28:34 Dean doing things to kids it can flag
28:37 all kinds of wild [ __ ] right so we will
28:39 probably get to a point if we don't go
28:42 back to the stone Age's where an AI will
28:45 most likely babysit the world but why
28:50 does that have to happen why does
28:53 anything like that have to happen
28:54 because right now we're headed right
28:56 towards it
28:56 okay this crime prediction shit's
28:59 debuting all over Europe believe me it's
29:02 going to debut all over South America
29:04 all over Africa India is probably China
29:08 and we'll just get compressed you know
29:14 into doing it ourselves everybody's
29:16 doing it right I'm gonna submit here the
29:22 one of the reasons why this is occurring
29:23 is that we are being too much of a sheep
29:26 we're not owning what we need to own
29:29 because we're so [ __ ] preoccupied
29:31 with Karate Kid on Netflix right we're
29:36 preoccupied with distracting ourselves
29:38 from reality now in all defense we
29:42 should have things that we can enjoy
29:45 but I think that you know it's why these
29:47 things of you have to enlist for a
29:50 little while and protect your country
29:53 this is a metaphor and then you do your
29:56 tour and you pop out of your tour and
29:58 you can go to Disneyland or Disney World
30:01 with your family for an and off tour and
30:05 then you have to go back to tour let's
30:07 say it's three years of pop so you
30:09 enlist you get trained you do three
30:11 years then you do three years out then
30:13 you enlist again get retrained as to the
30:15 new tactic tactics that have happened in
30:17 the last three years and you go out
30:18 protect again it's like a volunteer fire
30:22 squad all right that's the way it used
30:24 to be but no one wants to be disturbed
30:27 in this world right when jury duty comes
30:30 around what happens well some of us have
30:32 time to go to jury duty our our
30:35 employers are okay with it and of course
30:38 anyone gets on a multi-month murder
30:39 trial that's gonna be difficult for
30:41 anyone but some of you can't you have
30:45 hardships you need to go to work
30:47 you can't miss any days of work because
30:49 then you can't pay your bills yeah you
30:51 know they'll be exceptions but the
30:55 beautiful thing about waking up is it
30:58 really is a process of learning where we
31:00 are blind and obedient finding out the
31:05 lunacy of those formulas in certain
31:07 areas okay there are things that you
31:10 need to do to stay civilized in the
31:12 world I'm not talking about those things
31:14 right but the beautiful thing is is that
31:18 it's actually happening right now due to
31:19 things like YouTube we're able to
31:23 compare notes like never before there's
31:27 this you know the conspiracy of the
31:28 Mandela effect which says the history
31:30 changes because history is organic and
31:32 all I can say is if it's truly true okay
31:35 I just saw another video where Mark
31:37 Hamill was asked to say Luke I'm your
31:38 father which is phenomenal great that
31:42 means that this reality is completely
31:44 our imagination that's what it means
31:48 history is only there because we
31:50 remember it to be there as a group think
31:54 thing what's really fascinating about
31:57 this and it's
31:58 I kind of you know went wind around the
32:02 the actual charter of this episode which
32:04 is blind obedience but what I want you
32:06 to think about is the historical
32:09 indicators of this is true history or
32:12 this is false history based on blind
32:15 obedience one of the areas of blind
32:19 obedience that is extremely frustrating
32:20 and Graham Hancock is probably at the
32:24 tip of the spear for being frustrated
32:26 about this is the ancient history of
32:29 Egypt and there's a bunch of people that
32:31 have rediscovered this and they're
32:33 discovering now that the Aztec pyramids
32:36 in South America and the pre inca
32:39 structures are just like the pyramids in
32:42 Egypt in that they are built to be
32:43 conductive batteries okay but they've
32:48 got all the years messed up they have
32:50 this fake history right we have Moses as
32:52 a fake character in the Christian Bible
32:54 right well there's his menace in me and
32:58 yes yes excuse me he is their Savior
33:02 he's the one the united north and south
33:04 egypt which is the opposite polarity to
33:06 our north and south back in the day and
33:08 they say it all happened about 3200 BC
33:10 and then there's just about three
33:12 thousand years of building all this crap
33:13 in Egypt all based on hocus-pocus
33:17 horseshit because once we started
33:20 looking at their dates and their
33:21 pharaohs in temples it goes back nearly
33:25 40,000 years on a wall just don't look
33:29 up Graham Hancock and Graham has written
33:33 two books he's written a book about the
33:35 Sphinx and then he wrote a book called
33:37 the fingerprints of the gods
33:39 he has evolved his theory exponentially
33:44 since he wrote those books so in those
33:47 books he's very speculative but very
33:49 forceful and that these dates have to be
33:51 wrong and since he wrote those books he
33:53 has actually found the temples and found
33:55 the areas that proved he was his hunch
33:58 was correct but he's just one of many
34:01 many folks that have figured out that
34:03 all of our history is complete bunk
34:06 but what happens in what at what has
34:09 happened in the last 300 years has led
34:11 to a blind obedience belief of history
34:14 we relied on people to tell the truth
34:17 but because archaeologists and
34:20 anthropologists have to get their money
34:23 from institutions they have to produce
34:25 tangible results before they get their
34:28 loans and that's when they lie to get
34:29 the results right go look up the bones
34:32 of Lucy Lucy is an ape okay she is not a
34:36 homo sapien but when they laid out her
34:38 bones in the Box they screwed with all
34:41 the dimensions and all the placement of
34:42 a ribcage or shoulders to hide the fact
34:46 that she was a [ __ ] gorilla okay so
34:51 the beautiful thing is is that if you
34:53 thought everything was done in this
34:55 world which then extinguished your
34:57 personal interest in those things I'm
35:00 telling you you've been lied to about
35:03 nearly everything and all of its open
35:05 for reinterpretation do you want to go
35:10 the moon well if you believe you went
35:12 you probably don't give a [ __ ] about
35:13 going to the moon again I mean it's like
35:15 you would deny a ticket but it's not a
35:17 frontier but I'm telling you it's a
35:19 frontier it's never been touched ever
35:21 not with at least outward claims of
35:24 having gone if someone has the
35:25 anti-gravity vehicle and they've gone up
35:27 there we don't know about that okay
35:30 ancient history at least YouTube has
35:35 finally brought together in individuals
35:38 who are finally saying pre-inca but when
35:43 I was a kid they just said Inka when you
35:47 go down and ask the Incas who built
35:49 these walls out of these gigantic stones
35:52 stones that are too massive to pick up
35:56 with modern-day cranes you'd have to
35:58 take two cranes Lynch and hitch them
36:00 together and then pick this thing up one
36:03 of the stones and these stones are like
36:05 thousands 3,000 miles away like it's
36:10 it's in Peru but the stones come from
36:13 Brazil that's the closest place we can
36:15 find these stones it was like dragging a
36:17 gigantic stone that weighs more than
36:20 your
36:20 house times - 3,000 miles so you can put
36:23 it in a wall unreal right it's nothing
36:29 alien about him really yeah you think
36:32 aliens would have a lot more precision
36:34 than this but someone built them they
36:39 weren't Incas it's whatever was before
36:41 as if there was a absolutely brilliant
36:44 society and the funny thing is is that
36:46 true history erases this notion of ice
36:49 ages devouring the world every thirty
36:52 thousand years or whatever the hell that
36:53 [ __ ] story is that's simply to give
36:56 you a mechanism in your brain as to why
36:59 history seems to end because the modern
37:03 European archaeologist anthropologist
37:06 wants to make you believe that you know
37:10 they invented everything they discovered
37:12 everything but it's not true
37:14 I was watching some bizarre video on
37:19 YouTube where a guy was looking at he
37:22 was revealing a bunch of interesting
37:23 facts about architecture all over the
37:26 world and how massive these
37:29 architectural accomplishments were a lot
37:30 of the plateaus or slash podiums that
37:33 you know the Greek Athens parthenon
37:36 structures are built on the foundations
37:39 are keep getting more ancient and more
37:41 ancient to the point where they think
37:42 that some of the podiums that they built
37:45 these things on which is another word
37:46 for the foundation is over 80,000 years
37:48 old but then he says he says could this
37:52 be where aliens landed he just said that
37:54 at the end of every single archeological
37:56 thing where nothing remotely you know
38:00 was going towards this alien thing right
38:05 just ridiculous but the interesting
38:10 thing was when he was in Greece so I'm
38:12 sorry he was in Rome I think he was in
38:13 Rome but he says you know in this area
38:16 we are looking at ancient Rome and
38:19 ancient Greek architecture his brain
38:23 stops at Greece even though everything
38:27 you're looking at is an Egyptian temple
38:29 actually goes back to Egypt
38:31 he just cuts it off in his brain because
38:33 he's got a blood
38:34 ian's to where the architecture came
38:36 from not realizing that all column-based
38:38 stone architecture / marble architecture
38:42 in Rome and Greece was stolen from the
38:44 Egyptians but that just cuts off your
38:49 brain from following the rabbit hole
38:53 where it needs to go right I'm gonna
38:57 mention David Icke now because you talk
38:59 about a guy that doesn't and I don't
39:01 agree with a lot of his political views
39:04 today I don't agree I don't even know
39:05 how much I disagree with him honestly
39:07 but the one thing that he has is
39:08 equality to his character is that he
39:10 suffers zero percent from blind
39:13 obedience 0% for all I know he's right
39:17 about everything
39:18 but he has traveled the world and he is
39:21 just simply said what if all the stories
39:24 we've heard about our past are actually
39:25 true instead of allegorical or
39:27 metaphorical okay he opened my mind by
39:33 finding interesting conspiracies and of
39:35 course he's the reptilian guy he did
39:38 discover something that I've never heard
39:40 Joseph Campbell discover which is that
39:43 every culture that's every see any level
39:45 of distinguished notoriety in world
39:49 history seems to worship some sort of
39:51 serpent either a snake or a dragon or a
39:55 lizard
39:58 remember the Egyptians always had a
40:01 cobra brought over the third eye
40:03 all right the serpent was their advisor
40:07 as something would come through and
40:09 they've got all these hieroglyphs of
40:10 beams coming from space setting the
40:13 capstone of a pyramid the para Meridian
40:15 stone of a pyramid and shooting into the
40:17 third eye through the serpent through
40:20 the Cobra into their mind as if they're
40:23 getting programmed from space they're a
40:24 reptilian interface that's fact men but
40:31 one of the things I've mentioned on the
40:32 show a couple times is that the
40:35 Egyptians have the artistic ability to
40:37 render anything they could conceive of
40:38 and they had the ability to render it at
40:41 a level of accuracy that is still
40:43 puzzling everyone today
40:47 who had participate in creating
40:48 something like a big giant face it's
40:51 like the face of boat right it's it's
40:53 like a 12 foot square face and it's
40:55 perfectly symmetrical left and right
40:57 it's all based on PI like every single
40:59 thing as a circle it's three
41:02 dimensionally perfect we can't figure
41:05 out how they made it sure as hell wasn't
41:06 just hitting it with a stone you'd [ __ ]
41:11 it up you would you take a little bit
41:13 too much off the cheekbone over here and
41:15 it wouldn't be perfectly level but we
41:16 hit this thing with lasers now like that
41:19 face scanning [ __ ] that's in your iPhone
41:21 and it's perfect we've taken it into
41:25 Photoshop and feathered left onto right
41:26 and then blended that with the original
41:28 image and we can't find any mistakes on
41:33 some of this stuff right look at the
41:35 bust of King Tut you mean to tell me
41:38 they couldn't get it right if they
41:40 wanted to it's perfect it's a gold mask
41:43 of what we all believe is someone called
41:46 King Tut okay keep that in your brain
41:51 for one second here
41:52 a little bit more than a second keep it
41:54 in for a minute all right what else did
41:57 the Egyptians render in all of their
41:59 hieroglyphs the nubes set raw do all of
42:07 these beings that either had well most
42:11 of them have
42:12 some sort of animal head and a human
42:15 body and ant eater a hawk right Jekel do
42:23 we think that they couldn't draw what
42:26 they saw why would they create all these
42:30 animal humans in their architecture why
42:33 would they do that if it didn't have
42:36 some validity well then what if it did
42:40 but if they weren't screwing around what
42:42 if for some reason the gods as they
42:44 would call them those from another realm
42:48 could be a this dimension could be
42:51 another dimension whatever what if
42:52 they're like that and they're the ones
42:55 that kick-started the entire planet
42:57 because we seem to find that the arc out
43:00 they are archaeology and the
43:02 anthropological studies in those areas
43:04 go back further and further the more
43:06 they dig the more they find stuff that
43:08 precedes the last stuff that precedes
43:10 that stuff before that we see the utter
43:13 formation of language in Egypt from
43:15 everything being an icon right picture
43:18 picture picture picture picture picture
43:19 to phonetic alphabets the way we speak
43:24 today using salah bowls to make words
43:27 right blind obedience is everywhere it's
43:31 infected our consciousness as a child as
43:34 I always say a child has to as they what
43:39 I believe is they're coming out of their
43:41 spiritual realm from their previous
43:42 location they're surrendering their soul
43:47 knowledge to the bodies $0.05 system so
43:50 they can develop a consciousness so they
43:52 can essentially be with us and that's
43:56 how you have to do it as a child so at
43:59 one point it rewards us with the
44:00 mechanism but no one teaches you when
44:03 you're five six seven eight to hold back
44:06 okay now you're here right yeah okay
44:09 from this point forward I want you to
44:14 measure everything that comes through
44:16 your brain I want you to continue
44:18 thinking I want you to solve problems
44:21 puzzle yourself every once in a while
44:23 build a puzzle
44:25 solve what used to be called del logic
44:27 problems I don't even know if they make
44:28 those books anymore of it some people
44:30 get you know crossword puzzle things
44:32 they get those you know word finder
44:35 games Sudoku or Sudoku sorry and they
44:41 solve little math equations those are
44:43 all good for your brain but the del
44:45 logic problems were these other books
44:47 and they would give you a grid of
44:52 eventualities and you were supposed to
44:54 solve for everything that the quiz would
44:58 happen they would say something like
44:59 well this is about a bridge game and you
45:03 know Mary is Joe's husband and she plays
45:06 bridge two times a day our two times a
45:08 week but never on Wednesdays and then
45:11 Mary comes in she plays every single day
45:13 except for Friday's and they keep
45:16 telling you this story it's a paragraph
45:17 story up above and when it's all over
45:22 you'll know every single day that they
45:25 play bridge and you'll know who's
45:27 married to who who's friends with who
45:29 whatever they want to put inside the
45:30 equation it's so much fun I used to do
45:33 these as a kid in my teens and talk
45:35 about energizing your brain to think
45:38 screw algebra which you'll never [ __ ]
45:41 use in your entire lifetime right
45:43 algebra is there to teach you how to
45:44 think but there are much better ways
45:47 much more interesting ways to get you to
45:49 think we could take a kid who has
45:52 mastered algebra okay they take every I
45:56 don't know algebra 22 and I can take the
45:58 same amount of time or half the amount
46:00 of time let's go for this half the
46:02 amount of time and keep a whole class of
46:05 students in del logic problem books and
46:07 when it comes to life and thinking they
46:10 will smoke these algebra kids ten-to-one
46:12 and they'll just walk around the world
46:15 living in complete lucidity it'll be
46:19 very difficult for anyone to pull scam
46:20 on them because they just see through it
46:22 well it doesn't make any sense you say
46:24 you're rich well how about how come I
46:27 haven't seen you in anything that
46:29 remotely indicates that you have any
46:30 money
46:30 why aren't you investing in my company
46:32 if you say you're rich
46:34 you see these things all the time if you
46:37 don't like culture the culture that
46:39 we're in today let's just pick out
46:42 movies and music you don't like any of
46:46 the writing of either the music is a
46:50 bunch of rehashed horribly rehash
46:52 simplified versions of the Masters way
46:55 back in the day movies well again cliche
47:00 buckets
47:01 nothing creative there's no twist
47:05 there's no turns you never have to think
47:06 it's very obvious in the first act who
47:08 the bad person is or the good person is
47:10 you know the good person is always gonna
47:12 win because they always do and you're
47:15 like sitting in there going geez I used
47:17 to really like going to movies but
47:19 movies suck today but you're sitting at
47:21 home and you know you don't make movies
47:23 you don't make music you never will
47:24 and you're like god dammit why does this
47:29 all suck
47:30 and I send you a plane ticket to come to
47:34 Los Angeles and you're gonna meet with
47:35 all the top executives that run record
47:38 companies and movie companies studios
47:40 right and you land here in Los Angeles
47:44 and I give you a bracelet with a little
47:47 piece of equipment on it you say what's
47:50 this I said that's our invisible cloak
47:53 device go ahead and put it on hop in the
47:57 limo we drive to whatever studio you
48:00 want to go to before we get out I say
48:06 push that red button tink get it I push
48:10 mine pink can you see me yeah chauffeur
48:13 can you see us no sir
48:15 all right please come around open the
48:17 door for us he opens the door we walk
48:20 out we're completely invisible and I
48:23 happen to know that today is a big
48:25 meeting to green-light a bunch of films
48:26 to evaluate some films already in the
48:28 queue and we sneak onto the set we're
48:31 not even the set we sneak into the
48:33 executive rooms and we sit and one of
48:36 the chairs or sit on the banisters or
48:39 whatever listen and here's where you get
48:41 to see the problem
48:43 that relates directly to blind obedience
48:47 probably better described as the blind
48:49 leading the blind in some cases right
48:51 you hear a marketing department telling
48:54 the executives what people want to see
48:58 you hear all these lowbrow cliches and
49:02 formulas that determine the bottom line
49:05 well you know and find them we met put a
49:08 lot of special effects in there and then
49:10 we promote it this much we're always
49:12 making back this much money it's just a
49:14 game it's just a game of promotion and
49:17 special effects and someone in the room
49:19 has got a brain they're kind of like us
49:22 and they're like but the story is so bad
49:24 it could be so much better just give me
49:27 a month or two with some rewriters and
49:29 we'll get this thing to be a lot better
49:31 and everyone else looks at everyone else
49:35 in the room and they say but why why
49:38 spend an extra money to make it a little
49:40 bit better when all we're doing is
49:42 churning out [ __ ] and making a profit
49:44 from it that's all the world is is
49:46 profit profit profit art hey that died
49:49 when you a died right when United
49:51 Artists died and any competition of
49:54 quality died with them in other little
49:57 studios like that that cared all the
50:00 famous actors are old they just want to
50:04 make sure they don't die broke so they
50:06 don't care either
50:08 and the sad thing is is that you're
50:10 seeing the blind lead the blind within
50:11 this room within this meeting that I've
50:13 taken you to but you know that the
50:15 people that are going to buy the ticket
50:17 they're even more blind and that's why
50:21 culture suffers the second that we stick
50:23 our head in a hole and just hope that
50:26 things get better I know I'm preaching
50:28 to the choir trust me that's one of
50:31 these things where if you wake up and
50:33 you're like I'm awake I want to make a
50:34 difference in this world you kind of go
50:35 and [ __ ] what's the most effective way I
50:38 can do it for myself and help bring
50:41 people to awareness of this whole thing
50:45 this is one of the ways you can do it I
50:48 went to a trade show in Vegas a couple
50:50 weeks ago and the funny thing was that
50:54 door that open door thing happened
50:57 because there's a bunch of you know
50:58 every trade show it's at a convention
51:00 and they usually like call number one
51:02 Hall number two and you know we're
51:05 moving from place to place and this is
51:07 an industry trade show
51:10 meaning brilliant people to know
51:13 everything about broadcasting everything
51:15 about filmmaking operating cameras
51:18 there's genius hardware people genius
51:20 software people everywhere but they
51:24 still couldn't realize there's two
51:25 halves to a door and when it came to
51:29 lunchtime they're all piping through
51:31 this one door that's open while the
51:33 other door is completely unlocked and
51:35 that speaks to indoctrination right
51:40 you're academically brilliant you can
51:42 memorize and repeat things you can even
51:44 execute very complex hardware and
51:46 software tasks you can't think for
51:49 yourself the other one that always
51:51 happens to me is when I walk into a
51:53 restaurant haven't had this happen in a
51:55 while but you know when you have to wait
51:56 to be seated when you have a true maitre
52:00 d yet someone who understands they look
52:03 at you they look at your attire they
52:05 look at who you're with you're with your
52:06 family that's one place that they might
52:08 say to seat you but if you're with your
52:10 girlfriend and she's dressed up and
52:11 you're dressed up they put you in a
52:13 different place in the restaurant they
52:14 understand what's going on they're also
52:17 looking at how much money you're
52:18 probably going to spend with the group
52:19 that you're bringing the more money
52:21 to spend the better they'll put you in a
52:23 better place they'll put you in write
52:25 one of the tricks if you're young a
52:29 little trick from your uncle deep
52:31 thoughts here if your and your young 20s
52:34 but you're very mature and you have a
52:36 date that you'd like to impress slip the
52:40 dude a $20 bill and say put us in the
52:42 best place if you're up in a big pin
52:45 house restaurant and there are seats
52:47 against the window giving 20 to 50 bucks
52:51 trust me it'll pay off in the end and
52:53 say get me to one of the window seats
52:55 this is for you only if I can get a seat
52:58 over there on the window and it's not
53:00 reserved right they'll even yank
53:02 reserved signs if you pay them enough
53:04 okay but one of the things that happens
53:06 with average Mall installations mall
53:09 restaurants is some blind obedient
53:15 person who's maybe I don't
53:19 young usually if it doesn't always
53:20 happen this way they will see to sit you
53:23 in one of those stupidest places in the
53:25 restaurant right by the bathroom that
53:27 has all those horrible chemicals coming
53:28 out of it right by the kitchen that's
53:31 always gonna have someone slamming the
53:32 [ __ ] door coming in and out exactly
53:35 what you don't want to experience what I
53:38 do and this is one thing I did with my
53:40 daughter I said you know I tell her
53:42 right before this person came up two
53:44 minutes and look they're gonna try to
53:45 sis in a really shitty spot and watch
53:47 how we handle this
53:48 and she look here comes we get set in
53:51 his horrible area and as soon as they
53:54 point at the table
53:55 my daughter's waiting our girlfriends
53:58 behind me and I said I think we'd like
54:01 to sit over there and immediately they
54:04 go oh okay boom we go over and sit in a
54:08 much better location if they have any
54:11 problem understanding it I tell them I
54:12 don't want to listen to that door I
54:13 don't want to smell your urinal cakes
54:16 and you're in your bathroom here I'm
54:18 about to drop a hundred bucks on lunch
54:21 if you can't find a better place then
54:24 we're just gonna take ourselves
54:24 somewhere else right I never have to get
54:26 to that level of being a dick clarifying
54:29 my objectives right they'll just sit you
54:32 there because in their brain they're not
54:34 thinking
54:35 sit people down sit people down that's
54:38 all they think rate or sometimes they
54:40 inconvenience you based on where the
54:43 zones are for various waiters and
54:44 waitresses right you sort that out
54:49 I'm not sorting that out and then
54:51 obviously tip your help if they take
54:55 good care of you how many times you've
54:57 been a restaurant when they bring you a
54:58 completely burned meal half of that sort
55:04 of the the helps fault for not looking
55:06 at the meal and going Jesus Christ the
55:08 kitchen completely destroyed this and
55:10 I'm supposed to hand it to a customer
55:11 and get money for it alright if you go
55:13 buy a big steak or something happen have
55:16 this happen a little bit really long
55:17 time but I've even been with relatives
55:20 and they bring me a big burn steak or
55:24 whatever I'm burned bread that's one of
55:26 the one of the real classics right and I
55:30 will wait to the waitress comes over and
55:32 I you know I give a little bit of
55:34 responsibility to the waitress or the
55:36 waiter or whatever but I'm pretty pretty
55:38 friendly with it you know say look this
55:41 is burned like I don't eat burn food I'm
55:43 looking for food that's cooked not burnt
55:46 you know so please get this back and fix
55:50 it up you know and they always do but
55:54 I've had my relatives you know feel very
55:58 uneasy about that process don't say
56:01 anything don't say well I'm not gonna
56:03 [ __ ] pity you know thirty bucks for a
56:05 steak and eat like a Chuck Chuck hit you
56:08 know but it's interesting how there's
56:12 resistance against thinking and getting
56:16 what you really want in life sometimes
56:19 but you have to be that person it
56:21 educates everyone in the pipeline that
56:24 this is unacceptable you take you send
56:26 back one burn piece of toast or one
56:29 burned steak and you've saved a bunch of
56:31 people in the room from getting a burn
56:33 steak or burned piece of toast
56:35 thus making the world a better place and
56:38 this happens on all kinds of levels
56:39 right there's a million examples right
56:42 I'd love to hear some of your examples
56:44 in the comments to be honest there's a
56:47 million ways to make society a better
56:48 place right million ways hopefully some
56:54 of these episodes will help you see a
56:57 bunch of different perspectives of how
56:59 to get that to happen and some of you
57:01 are going to be more equipped to take
57:03 some of these formulas and correct them
57:05 than other formulas which is why I
57:07 continued going and putting more and
57:10 more in the library so that you can say
57:15 well you know this book I'm not really
57:16 into that oh but this one's really cool
57:18 I can totally do that and I know exactly
57:20 what he's saying I have it way worse
57:23 than this dude right and just in closing
57:26 the the other word the other synonym for
57:30 blind obedience might be habit some
57:34 habits can be the difference between
57:35 life and death and they're good and if
57:38 you continue these habits you'll stay
57:39 healthy you will stay lucid you'll live
57:43 a lot longer and happier right part of
57:47 the detoxification I'm always going on
57:49 about allows you to be sentient in your
57:51 body as your body is healthy to keep you
57:54 alive
57:54 but the more you pollute your brain with
57:56 things that destroy your brain the big
57:59 trend nowadays is that you are alive but
58:04 you're dead and I've mentioned this a
58:07 couple times and really old episodes but
58:09 I'm gonna throw this back out there so
58:10 you can kind of see how habits can give
58:15 you a fortuitous life or one with a lot
58:20 of despair as the chainsaw goes off
58:23 behind me [ __ ] me I'll see if I can't
58:26 remove that in post
58:28 I once went to an old folks home
58:30 regularly in my late teens and took care
58:35 of I was assigned to one woman but I
58:37 ended up taking care of to actually end
58:39 up taking care of a lot of them because
58:40 a lot of them thought I was their
58:41 relative cuz they're suffering from
58:44 massive dementia massive Alzheimer's and
58:47 they just think I was their son and
58:49 they'd greet me and I would just turn
58:51 into their son immediately I play piano
58:54 for them forever talk to them whatever
58:56 it was a lot of fun and in the room that
59:01 I was assigned to a 93 year old woman
59:02 and ended up finding a room with three
59:06 women in it about a 93 year old I
59:09 believe an 86 year old and a 74 year old
59:12 and when you talk about blind obedience
59:14 when it comes to health because we all
59:16 were lied to about you know the safety
59:19 of saccharin and margarine and
59:22 microwaves and all this other stuff that
59:23 creates all kinds of poisons for us
59:26 among other things the 93 year olds was
59:30 completely mobile she could dress
59:33 herself every single day never had any
59:35 dementia and never had any Alzheimer's
59:37 she remembered everything that happened
59:39 from previous visits never thought I was
59:41 her son the 86 year old was of the same
59:45 mental capacity but she had lost the
59:47 ability to walk for whatever reason I
59:50 didn't really ask him about her I didn't
59:52 ask her about her issues physically but
59:56 the 74 year old would lay on the bed and
59:58 it was literally like first the first
60:02 bed was a 93 year old the second one was
60:05 86 year old and the third one was a 74
60:07 year old the 74 year old was this really
60:10 beautiful old woman and they always took
60:14 really good care of her I mean it was
60:15 this place was phenomenal her hair
60:17 always looked fantastic she always had
60:19 makeup and lipstick on which was very
60:21 bright red and a beautiful dress but
60:24 every time I saw her she was lying on
60:26 the bed and in all my visits which were
60:29 probably at least a dozen or two she
60:33 never spoke she never got up she never
60:36 walked around and if you think about it
60:39 each generation ten years down
60:41 the 90s the eighties in the 70s because
60:44 the woman on the Left
60:45 far-left was 19 years younger than the
60:50 one that was fully mobile and conscious
60:55 they had different eating habits they
60:58 different life habits they different
61:01 educational regiments because of their
61:03 different ages the younger that these
61:06 girls got the more they became in valent
61:15 all three women are surely gone by now
61:18 because that was 30 years ago so give
61:21 that some thought
61:23 well generation are you in hopefully we
61:26 can come back to the 93 year old by
61:29 detoxing by thinking right I know you
61:34 feel me if you have many deep thoughts
61:37 radio Calm please go there's audio video
61:39 there's even audio of a chainsaw there's
61:43 a lakh Facebook group and patreon so
61:47 take care of yourself think for yourself
61:48 and I'll see in the next deep thoughts
61:51 over now
