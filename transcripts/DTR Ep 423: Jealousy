00:29 welcome to deep thoughts ladies and
00:32 gentlemen let me ask you this if I had a
00:36 magic wand and I could wave it at you
00:39 and the second I wave it at you you were
00:44 no longer jealous about anything in your
00:46 entire lifetime your entire life journey
00:49 from that point forward is ignorant and
00:52 permanently incapable of conceiving of
00:56 jealousy you hear the word we hear
00:58 someone describe the definition to you
01:00 it at no point in your life from that
01:03 point forward does it make any sense and
01:06 therefore your desires on a daily basis
01:09 are simply based on your preferences for
01:12 life if there's something missing out of
01:15 your life an object to place or thing or
01:19 person you simply make a plan do what
01:25 you need to do and go get it
01:27 you know some things are gonna be very
01:29 easy to get because you can go to the
01:31 department store and part with a little
01:32 bit of money some things you might be
01:34 able to create with your bare hands and
01:36 other things might require you to
01:37 improve your character or to display
01:40 your character to another human being to
01:42 entice them to be a part of your life
01:45 but from that point forward you are
01:48 completely and utterly focused on what
01:50 you want in life because you're not
01:51 being distracted by this thing we call
01:54 jealousy hmm so you saw this episode
02:00 tied on you're like oh my god he's gonna
02:02 do one of those talk about jealousy well
02:06 to the degree that what I just
02:09 demonstrated in words would be a
02:12 mind-blowing improvement to your life or
02:15 would have been a mind-blowing
02:19 improvement to your life this episode
02:22 will be very interesting to you because
02:24 I asked myself you know we know what
02:26 jealousy is we want something that we
02:28 don't have but someone else has it it
02:32 always has to require someone else hey I
02:37 could sit in my living room
02:38 I want to have a bigger television or I
02:42 want to have an amazing wife when have
02:44 amazing kids or whatever the hell I want
02:46 just name it
02:47 that's just desire and you might even be
02:52 sad that you don't have those things but
02:54 you can deal with those emotions and you
02:55 can use that as the mother of invention
02:57 to go get what you want in life but the
03:00 second that you focus yourself on
03:03 someone else having it perhaps them
03:05 having it for the was the very first
03:07 time you realize that that thing is half
03:10 a bull and so now you're like oh my god
03:12 I want one of those especially if you go
03:15 and experience it someplace else you
03:17 experience a hundred inch television and
03:20 you come home to your little 40 inch
03:21 television like oh my god
03:23 this is embarrassing I know I know why
03:25 my friends think things about me which
03:27 is wrong but you believe that but isn't
03:31 it weird how little kids have it almost
03:32 automatically and no parent has to
03:35 indoctrinate their child into this your
03:38 kid sees another kid with a toy they
03:40 want the toy they want to play with a
03:42 toy just seeing the love maybe even
03:45 feeling telepathically as children the
03:48 other child loving that toy creates a
03:51 little stream of consciousness that your
03:53 child sees and feels and goes oh my god
03:57 I gotta have that experience right now
03:59 and they go over and try to take it
04:02 because in their brain there is no
04:03 limitations there's no courtesy there's
04:07 no wait your turn there's no concept of
04:09 mine and yours it's mine mine mine mine
04:12 mine
04:13 jealousy destroys lives jealousy
04:17 preoccupies lifes and jealousy keeps you
04:20 from ever being focused jealousy makes
04:25 it almost impossible to develop a plan
04:27 in some cases now I there are plenty of
04:31 people that have gotten things in life
04:33 because of their jealousy and they were
04:34 smart enough to route it back into the
04:38 mother invention and the plan that was
04:41 going to get them what they wanted
04:43 there's a lot of rock stars today who
04:47 became rock stars because when they were
04:49 slightly too young to be one they saw
04:52 their
04:52 stars have fame and money and love from
04:56 a crowd and they said that's what I want
04:59 so they picked up to the guitar they
05:01 picked up the mic they picked up the
05:03 sticks and he started playing and he
05:06 sucked it first and then they got good
05:07 and they kept pushing pushing pushing
05:11 pushing everything else aside as a
05:13 matter of fact until someone heard him
05:15 one day who had the power to give them
05:17 promotion and a record contract and a
05:19 tour and an album albeit now online and
05:25 then they stepped through that membrane
05:27 that they couldn't step back through
05:29 which is you are now officially
05:33 phenomenal what you do and just like a
05:36 college degree or anything else you
05:37 learn in life it's very hard for anyone
05:40 to take it away from you now every rock
05:43 star has a about a ten to fifteen year
05:46 lifespan unless you become an ultra mega
05:48 hit and you can have a lifetime of it
05:51 but what I like to think about when I
05:54 think about these sorts of bizarre
05:56 moments that seem to happen out of the
05:58 human programming that are so profoundly
06:01 acidic without dr. nation as a matter of
06:04 fact but I like to think of other
06:08 moments when we can kind of understand
06:10 the human mind a bit
06:12 now I used to think in the Genesis the
06:17 book of Garden of Eden right after Eve
06:21 eats the Apple a bunch of stuff goes to
06:24 hell right must demonize women right
06:27 from the very beginning right but they
06:30 didn't wear any clothes as the story
06:31 goes and they were blissfully naked the
06:35 weather was good everything there's
06:37 plenty of soft things to lie down on
06:39 there were animals but apparently no
06:41 predators cool and then this Apple thing
06:46 happens and the devil you know work
06:50 you're up to it and then God comes down
06:53 and I can't remember exactly who said
06:56 which way the other thing but I know God
06:58 made a bunch of changes to punish both
07:02 of them
07:04 but at one point they were told that
07:06 they were naked and now the sudden they
07:09 needed to cover themselves and it was
07:12 interesting they had to be indoctrinated
07:14 into believing that the way that they
07:15 were was not perfectly normal and he
07:19 used to think that's the dumbest thing
07:21 ever really they just suddenly think the
07:24 clothing is is the way that they should
07:27 be I mean what you do shoma Sears
07:30 catalog and say this is what clothing
07:32 are see all those models in that way
07:33 there's no other human beings on earth I
07:35 don't know how they got this
07:36 instantaneous self loathing in the
07:39 metaphorical story that is Genesis but
07:43 then I was watching this Peruvian jungle
07:46 video were undiscovered tribes were
07:50 starting to bump into the civilize
07:53 peruvian citizens and some scientific
07:55 anthropologists and the first video I
07:58 ever saw of them this guy crosses the
08:00 river there's about a dozen of them
08:02 they're traveling in Paris it's very
08:05 interesting one of them was definitely
08:07 the loudest and talked and he comes
08:11 across the water and of course they're
08:13 freaked out a little bit because he's
08:14 got long Spears and I think some of you
08:16 had arrows and their views are super
08:19 long they're like three are like well
08:21 geez by four or five foot long arrows
08:23 and they immediately went into the huts
08:25 which were all kind of exposed didn't
08:28 have full walls didn't need it it's all
08:30 warm and he started stealing clothing
08:33 and then I kept watching the series and
08:36 it went on for at least a year of
08:39 continuing to communicate with these
08:41 individuals as they started sharing
08:45 their language and they finally figured
08:46 out how to communicate which dialects in
08:50 which root languages were there and then
08:54 they studied words and they work
08:55 together and then the kid about a year
08:58 later is fully clothed in a shot which
09:00 looked really strange and he actually
09:03 said the line right on the Bible he said
09:05 um he goes when I saw you guys were in
09:08 clothing he said it you know I
09:11 immediately got jealous that you had
09:14 this and when I put on a shirt and I
09:16 a pair of pants and I put on some shoes
09:18 like like sandals and I realized how
09:22 amazing this is to have some more than
09:24 some in protection on my body I felt so
09:27 embarrassed that we hadn't invented
09:30 clothing yes he was just wearing a
09:32 little string down down south that was
09:34 it some makeup stuff in his hair that
09:36 was about it
09:37 and then eventually his tribe all became
09:40 clothed and of course that created the
09:46 bubble of jealousy within all of the
09:48 other undescribed try undiscovered
09:50 tribes and those other tribes they're
09:52 all brutal man he was talking about it
09:54 because man they come down and they they
09:56 kill us and the you know my parents were
10:00 genocided and done it up
10:01 not technically completely genocide
10:03 because they're all sort of the same
10:04 race but according to their tribal
10:08 definition they were at the water where
10:11 this river went through because they
10:13 were pushed to the water by the other
10:15 tribes the nice thing about these
10:17 subjects is that you have plenty
10:19 experience in it usually and some people
10:23 will lie and say I don't have any Josie
10:25 in my life all right great then you must
10:28 be the most successful most happy person
10:30 on planet earth now you can definitely
10:33 and most definitely will achieve a very
10:38 nice plateau in your desires versus your
10:41 accomplishments and perhaps material
10:43 possessions and what-have-you but
10:45 usually a human being can always think
10:48 of something that they wanted they don't
10:52 have part of this show is making sure
10:55 you have total and utter control over
10:56 your life right
10:57 well jealousy is a gigantic sort of
11:03 topic that we don't typically talk about
11:06 I mean think about it
11:07 how many times first corny is this
11:09 episode might be titled and it might
11:11 seem okay how many times have you sat
11:14 down with your parents and had a decent
11:16 in-depth discussion about how to manage
11:19 what what jealousy is how to manage it
11:22 when you went to high school and college
11:24 let's say for those of you have degrees
11:27 maybe some of you have PhDs
11:31 maybe some of you and psychiatric
11:34 divisions have had these call of these
11:37 conversations but think about it you had
11:38 to get a PhD to get it most likely these
11:41 are fundamental emotions of life that
11:44 destroy the quality of life and we don't
11:47 even talk about it
11:49 we don't talk about a little bit we
11:51 don't talk about a lot what do marketing
11:55 firms try to do for products they try to
11:59 make you lust after the product they
12:02 want to make you feel inadequate that
12:04 you don't have the product in some cases
12:07 they're right on point with trying to
12:09 make you very jealous that you don't
12:12 have a particular product and someone
12:14 else does there's the whole Keeping Up
12:16 with appearances as it's really
12:19 referenced in Great Britain
12:21 here's we called the Jones me syndrome
12:24 right your buddy next door buys a boat
12:26 well [ __ ] you got to have one now my
12:29 neighborhoods hilarious when I first
12:32 moved in here nobody had a boat
12:34 nobody had a RV nobody had a golf cart
12:39 nobody had a jetski okay and then one
12:44 guy buys it and about four other guys
12:46 have to buy it it's unbelievable
12:49 if you drive up and down my street it
12:52 looks like you know someone has invited
12:55 every neighbor or sorry every relative
12:57 from Kansas to come here and just park
12:59 out front
13:00 you know like vacation the movie one guy
13:04 bought a golf cart another dude bought a
13:05 golf cart crazy
13:08 they temper their jealousy by
13:12 immediately grabbing the tail the guy in
13:14 front of them and getting the same thing
13:17 I have no idea if there's any you know
13:23 spousal pressure where they go well you
13:26 know if you were a winner you'd have an
13:27 RV ahead of your winner you'd have a
13:29 golf cart and then there's pressure I
13:32 know in some cases the dudes who go
13:34 first they get reprimanded for spending
13:37 that money and then later on when three
13:39 other dudes buy the same thing I'm sure
13:43 that that reprimand
13:44 subsides overtime you know and there's
13:49 you know I guess materialism consumerism
13:54 trying to make yourself happy by getting
13:56 possessions there's a whole division of
13:59 jealousy in that which is probably the
14:02 medium level jealousy it's medium you
14:07 might look at someone else's career
14:09 someone else's wealth bracket how much
14:12 money you think they have in the bank
14:13 which is usually completely wrong even
14:16 if they tell you but in some cases you
14:20 know let's just say someone's jealous of
14:24 Steve Jobs when he was alive because he
14:26 was a billionaire and he ran his own
14:28 company and he created the most
14:29 incredible things with the most
14:31 incredible people someone might have
14:33 found themselves jealous of that kind of
14:36 lifestyle or at least of the wealth of
14:40 the reward that comes from it they don't
14:42 do the work but they definitely want the
14:44 money that's what I find in life is
14:45 people who think that it's just easy to
14:50 become these people you know like there
14:53 was the big thing about how much money
14:55 Donald Trump inherited from his father
14:58 and he's got siblings who all greed on
15:01 the number and oh yeah you know if he we
15:03 got the same amount he got there's not
15:05 more to him and less to us and I we know
15:07 what we got and it's this right and then
15:10 they think that I think the highest
15:12 number I ever heard was something like
15:15 like ten million dollars I think he said
15:19 it was like one or two but then he turns
15:22 it into this ten billion dollar empire
15:23 and people will it's usually what I
15:28 would seriously call you know a peasant
15:31 which doesn't many mean how smart you
15:34 are or how much money you have it means
15:36 how you perceive the world and a petty
15:39 way they will say well he got money it's
15:43 easy to make money when you got money
15:44 and you know make it ten billion dollars
15:47 out of even 50 let's make it a hundred
15:50 this make his father give him a hundred
15:51 million dollars and he turns it into a
15:53 ten billion dollar empire and they'll
15:56 say well that was easy because he
15:57 money oh yeah well I know a lot of
16:01 people worth 10 million dollars or more
16:03 and they are nowhere close to doubling
16:07 that in fact almost the investors I now
16:10 had finite moments in their life where
16:12 they made a ton of cash whatever they
16:13 made and they have never earned a
16:16 significant dime after that so if making
16:19 money was easy then you would have your
16:22 shot without doing much work and the sad
16:26 thing is is that let's say there's
16:28 someone out there that actually might
16:32 have the tenacity to be a Donald Trump
16:35 you could resuscitate whatever he's easy
16:37 because he took nothing and made it
16:39 something huge right but if they get too
16:44 much into the hate game and the jealousy
16:46 game then what do they miss they miss
16:50 the brilliance of the man that made it
16:51 happen in a particular era that you'd
16:53 have to come with new techniques for
16:54 your era but then again he was a genius
16:57 in his era but if somebody minimizes it
17:00 to deal with their jealousy then they're
17:03 missing the entire theme and algorithm
17:06 of what you have to do to get rich if
17:09 that's what you really want that's what
17:11 you think you want and believe me if you
17:13 have never been something in your life
17:15 ever and you think you want to be that
17:19 thing I need to throw a big warning sign
17:22 at you you have no clue whether or not
17:25 you can be that or whether or not you
17:28 would like to be that there are so many
17:30 friends of mine that wanted to be
17:31 musicians until they found out they had
17:33 to write music and they had to write it
17:36 incessantly for 10 years and not only
17:39 did they have to write music but they
17:41 had to write top-ten hits that's what
17:44 they're supposed to do you need to write
17:46 a song that the whole world at any one
17:48 point in time is going to buy so many
17:51 copies of that you're going to hit a
17:53 chart in whatever genre of music which
17:57 when I grew up there weren't that many
17:58 genres and now there's so many genres
17:59 you could have the number one hit and
18:01 yeah I don't know some version of techno
18:04 electronic music and no one else in the
18:06 world knows you exist but everybody in
18:08 that industry does but that's only a
18:10 hundred thousand
18:10 kids or 500,000 kids so you're trying to
18:12 go gold which is 500,000 copies sold you
18:16 can't even make it because you can't get
18:18 every single kid who listens to that
18:20 type of music to buy your song plus with
18:23 piracy good luck where are other forms
18:26 of jealousy that go up much deeper and
18:29 much more intense than that love
18:32 jealousy is probably one of the worst
18:36 little tornadoes you can get yourself
18:38 involved in because it's irrational as a
18:42 rational could be but let's look at the
18:46 fundamentals real quick because some
18:47 people might argue with me on that what
18:50 if someone looks a particular way in
18:52 society as at large thinks that that's
18:57 not attractive however you look maybe
19:00 one year red hair is something and the
19:03 next year blonde hair something next to
19:05 your blue brunettes something and she
19:07 always trying to trace a trend because
19:09 you don't want to you're trying to get
19:10 what other people perceivably have for
19:12 the reasons that you think they got
19:14 those things so you might look at
19:16 someone who is being celebrated for
19:18 being very attractive and you think
19:20 you're not well I would say up until the
19:24 Internet's existence you may have
19:27 falsely deduced that there's no one for
19:31 you that someone there's not a single
19:33 person out there that would look at the
19:34 way you look and find you utterly
19:36 attractive or the way you behave the way
19:38 you talk we might tell a joke the way
19:42 you might be introverted and quiet maybe
19:45 you're a book book type person you read
19:47 more than you you die a dialogue with
19:50 individuals well the internet has proved
19:54 it beyond the shadow of a doubt there
19:56 are large groups of people for every
19:59 type of human being that exists on this
20:01 planet it doesn't matter what size shape
20:03 you are whether you have a speech
20:05 impediment
20:07 they're burn victim or whatever there is
20:10 someone out there that will love you
20:13 more than you can process meaning they
20:17 will love you more than you can digest
20:19 it you just got to find them within
20:23 their circumstantial situations which I
20:26 run into here quite a bit
20:28 which is and I'll give you an example
20:31 this isn't the only way this happens but
20:35 I think that most of you will have this
20:37 in your neighborhood and you might even
20:38 be one of these people who are fortunate
20:40 enough to do this and I want to digress
20:43 for one second there's nothing cooler
20:45 than someone who's been given this
20:48 opportunity who still behaves in a very
20:50 humble manner and I've met almost
20:53 unanimously these kind of people which
20:55 is very cool but in Southern California
20:57 there's obviously a tremendous amount of
21:00 money like crazy money okay some of the
21:04 richest people on planet earth have
21:05 homes here they may not stay here 24/7
21:09 365 but they own them and they come and
21:11 visit but because there are so many
21:14 families that have been here for such a
21:16 long time some of them got rich because
21:18 they bought property when this place was
21:20 considered nothing they hung on to it it
21:23 appreciated they flipped it and sold it
21:25 and you vested against their equity and
21:27 we're able to get more homes and create
21:30 a business or whatever it was but we
21:33 have a plethora of trust fund babies in
21:36 Orange County California meaning
21:39 children of extremely wealthy people who
21:42 never have to work because as soon as
21:44 they hit 18 they get a nice allowance or
21:46 they get all their inheritance or what
21:47 have you it's always different but I'll
21:51 be down at the beach I'll be getting a
21:54 taco from someplace down there
21:56 especially during summer and you'll see
22:00 you know the hottest Lamborghini brand
22:05 new I mean the million dollar one it's
22:07 not the hundred thousand dollar ones you
22:10 know with just kidded out you know just
22:11 crazy amazing things Bentleys and
22:13 rolls-royce phantoms that are all
22:15 tricked out you know the most amazing
22:17 things on planet earth and you see this
22:18 in LA as well
22:20 and you will realize I mean there's a
22:24 really young person in there with
22:26 another young person maybe it's a buddy
22:28 or a girlfriend or something
22:30 and you'll see it and you're thinking my
22:34 god that you know that car is an amazing
22:36 car and I'm sure they live in a nice
22:39 home I'm sure it's down by some water
22:41 somewhere and you're thinking gosh I'd
22:44 like to experience that you know right
22:48 now in the future like to have that as
22:50 an option in my life to be able to have
22:52 those things so no one's immune because
22:56 it's almost guttural for your own
22:59 goal-setting now what I'll do with that
23:01 sort of thing is take it home take home
23:06 the desire and really think it through
23:08 well I've been in extremely large homes
23:11 before not that I've lived in them and
23:14 I've sort of like you know looked at the
23:17 finances of them you know how much tax
23:19 it takes to keep the property mine the
23:23 upkeep on these big homes I've dated
23:25 people who've had gigantic homes and
23:27 they've told me look we had any one
23:30 particular day five to seven people just
23:32 taking care of the house on an average
23:34 day if we're gonna throw a party we
23:36 bring in like 12 more to get the place
23:39 ready a girl I dated once who was
23:42 divorced she said she but as soon as he
23:45 built the house what she designed was
23:47 gorgeous amazing she said I never saw my
23:49 husband you know relatively speaking
23:51 could never be nude in her house because
23:54 there's so many people running around
23:56 fixing up things it kind of became a
23:58 prison never saw that coming
24:01 24 car garage downstairs two
24:04 Lamborghinis every single thing you can
24:07 imagine was downstairs classic cars
24:10 brand-new cars I mean it's unbelievable
24:11 stood was damn near a billionaire when
24:16 she came out of it which was her choice
24:20 it was very amicable situation as I
24:23 understand it but she sort of fell out
24:25 of love with most of it not all of it
24:27 but most of it
24:29 she's got decent sized place you know
24:33 she has some finer amenities it's in a
24:35 decent neighborhood she don't go
24:36 completely down to nothing but she
24:40 really got adjusted I see this all the
24:43 time in people you know what is the
24:46 disease of a hoarder outside of the
24:49 cause which is usually some sort of
24:52 traumatic experience a hoarder is trying
24:56 to be happy with objects in most cases
25:01 now there's a lot of variation so
25:03 obviously you know there's the hoarder
25:05 that thinks that everything will become
25:06 useful at some point in their future
25:08 they see this sort of fantasy future
25:11 with a particular part or something they
25:13 can find a broken-down lawnmower and
25:15 they think oh my god I'm but always
25:17 wanted to learn how to fix a lawnmower
25:18 and they bring it home and they put it
25:19 in the back and they never touch it
25:20 again the main thing I want you to focus
25:24 on during this episode is this every
25:27 minute you spend jealous of anything you
25:32 are losing out on you spending any time
25:36 to get the thing that you want if you
25:39 just focus at the same time we have to
25:42 acknowledge the jealousy is just a fact
25:46 of life
25:47 it just happens to us now what's
25:51 interesting is is to ride the ball of
25:53 jealousy every once in a while because
25:55 it'll happen to you without your
25:57 knowledge right again material objects
26:00 are sadly the probably the number one
26:04 most consistent thing that happens to a
26:06 human being in the modern age even that
26:09 tribe tribesmen and wanted clothing
26:11 right you see it you desire it and then
26:18 there's two paths you can go on fork
26:21 number one which isn't so good for you
26:23 as you let it manifest inside you you
26:26 may even direct negative thoughts that
26:29 the person who has it and you might even
26:32 engage in immediate dialogue about oh
26:35 the guy driving Lamborghinis probably a
26:37 douche in da-da-da-da-da
26:39 or she's this and that you know she's a
26:41 spoiled housewife and da-da-da-da-da
26:44 not realizing
26:47 any degree of time the sacrifices she
26:51 might be making to have this lifestyle
26:53 you know there's a lot of beautiful
26:55 housewife's
26:56 here in Orange County and I mean drop
26:58 dead they're in the gym two hours a day
27:02 five days a week they're expected to
27:05 have children that's their main goal in
27:07 life and sometimes their husbands are
27:10 really dapper amazing you know
27:12 businessman and other times they're
27:15 pretty pretty not dapper okay and I'm
27:19 hoping that these people actually love
27:21 each other but I think a lot of these
27:23 marriages are simply a business
27:24 relationship because a woman has a time
27:28 when she is healthy to have children and
27:30 then it becomes increasingly more
27:31 difficult because of all the toxins and
27:33 our foods to do then and children in of
27:36 suffering the more that the parents gain
27:39 all the toxicity and try to multiply so
27:43 they want to get them out in and out
27:44 early some of them have I know for a
27:47 fact you know have these very clinical
27:49 you know prenups that says you must be
27:52 married to me for ten years and you get
27:54 this amount of money and if you can stay
27:56 another ten years if we both choose to
27:58 continue the relationship you get this
28:00 amount of money the kids aren't even in
28:03 the equation there'll be 10 years old
28:05 without both parents in the house but
28:07 because it's a business so before you
28:10 get jealous of other people I want you
28:12 to take a little bit of time out to
28:13 roleplay out what their life is probably
28:15 like I've said it a couple times on the
28:18 show you know when I really started
28:21 hanging out with my rocker buddies from
28:23 the 80s and I heard about their lives
28:27 yes you know when they were in their 20s
28:30 they loved their lives you know being
28:34 famous famous rock stars and doesn't
28:36 getting platinum albums and all that
28:38 kind of stuff that was good because they
28:39 were in the age bracket that could do
28:40 that kind of daily churn he had a
28:42 tremendous amount of energy but once
28:44 they hit 30 the body started changing
28:47 once they hit 40 their bodies start
28:49 changing you know I feel extremely sorry
28:52 for these rockers that feel obligated to
28:58 continue performing
28:59 when they don't have the body to
29:01 actually do it anymore or you know most
29:05 of them would still love to be exactly
29:06 like they were in their 20s but you know
29:08 they got bad knee joints I once saw
29:10 Kansas play my hometown in Kansas which
29:13 was the craziest most surreal thing in
29:15 the world I didn't even know they were
29:17 in town in my town's teeny-tiny so it
29:19 was a favor they were doing to another
29:21 guy who was a millionaire in her
29:22 hometown well I watched this this lead
29:25 guitarist dude crawl up the back stairs
29:28 to the concert I could tell right away
29:31 his knees were gone ten years ago he
29:35 ripped the crap out of that guitar I'll
29:37 tell you that much
29:37 I mean you he was he was just as good as
29:41 he ever was if not better but I see that
29:44 and I think gosh you know it's like
29:46 being a football player or Eddie but
29:48 anyone any sports but especially
29:50 football because of the brutality on the
29:51 body and being a boxer for instance
29:53 getting your head pounded over and over
29:55 again
29:56 you think there's no permanent
29:59 repercussions some of these guys get out
30:01 okay but the dudes that go on named
30:03 these these defensive linemen and these
30:06 offensive linemen that are pounding each
30:07 other they barely ever get named but
30:09 they're taking on the broken legs and
30:11 all this other stuff you know there's
30:15 the stories of these guys that have to
30:16 have cranes lift them out of bed in the
30:18 morning are you sure you're really
30:20 jealous of all these other people in
30:22 life and we know that on both sides of
30:25 the sexes especially well there might be
30:28 a really attractive female and a really
30:31 attractive male but that unmanaged could
30:37 produce a really bad human being and
30:40 they could be wonderful in public when
30:42 the cameras pointed at them because they
30:44 understand there's a career to maintain
30:46 an image to maintain
30:47 as soon as the door shuts you never know
30:50 what kind of jerks these people could be
30:53 we don't mean to cast aspersions on
30:55 people as a solution to jealousy but
30:59 this what you want to understand is that
31:01 the grass is just like the grass on your
31:03 side okay sometimes it rains a lot and
31:07 the grass looks fantastic you don't have
31:09 to even water your lawn other times your
31:12 it looks like you know an alien burned a
31:16 hole in your front yard
31:17 it just happens there's an old saying
31:20 and a Cheech and Chong movie called
31:22 things are tough all over and I didn't
31:26 understand that at all when I was kid
31:27 I've actually worked and ran the theater
31:29 when that came through as a kid things
31:32 are tough all over and it's true to a
31:38 degree but that toughness is actually
31:42 what makes us who we are
31:46 you know I tell you guys I write all the
31:48 time right
31:49 so I do it full-time now it's my job and
31:53 I'm blessed to be in this situation but
31:56 I will tell you that I watch a Westworld
32:01 a Deadwood a Carnivale even American
32:05 Gods and and other great movies that are
32:08 that are created out there
32:11 secondhand lion was one of the most
32:15 masterfully written little movies I saw
32:17 recently made in 2003 with Robert Duvall
32:19 and was it Michael Caine I get jealous
32:24 immediately of the amazing writing that
32:26 is in these shows however all I do is I
32:31 come home and try to upgrade my skill
32:34 set to be that good by detecting their
32:37 writing you know watching a Tarantino
32:39 movie and you should be humbled by his
32:43 ability to capture the human condition
32:46 in a scene no matter what's going on
32:48 nothing's going on everything's going on
32:51 he'll nail it either way and I'm you
32:54 know I may not love every single movie
32:56 that guy's ever made but he's got a few
32:58 gems that are utterly phenomenal but now
33:02 let's take a let's put a pin right in
33:05 front of our eyesight here of jealousy
33:07 we understand that we haven't talked
33:10 about every iteration of jealousy and
33:11 all the factors of it but we generally
33:13 we all know what that is right now let's
33:17 introduce a new pin which is called
33:21 inspiration
33:23 being inspired because that is what we
33:28 need to be instead of jealous
33:31 so I've recently had this conversation
33:35 several times with two or three friends
33:38 of mine and the the conversation will go
33:44 like this and it's definitely this way
33:45 for me to when I go out and I see
33:48 perfection I get inspired to be as
33:54 amazing at what I do as the talent I'm
34:00 seeing and music is one of the greatest
34:04 things to see when you see great live
34:07 performances and I have been blessed to
34:09 see some of the best live performances
34:12 on planet earth instead of being jealous
34:16 most of us aren't sitting in the in the
34:19 in the audience being jealous of people
34:22 we love on stage if it's your band you
34:26 are glad to be able to see them perform
34:28 to hear it live yeah sure you might for
34:33 a moment think you want their lifestyle
34:36 again roll back to the part of
34:38 conversation about the lifestyle they
34:39 really live I mean how many of you would
34:42 want to be in Nikki Sixx's shoes and
34:45 shoot like you know a metric ton of
34:47 heroin in your body
34:48 no thanks men no thanks no my style but
34:53 you can see someone play the drums
34:55 like was it Rob Zombie's drummer who
34:58 also plays for Black Sabbath I always
35:00 forget the guy's name most unbelievable
35:02 drummer I've ever seen in my life and
35:04 I've got a best friend who's one of the
35:05 most amazing drummers on this planet but
35:09 I see how amazing he is at it and what
35:11 it tells me right away is how hard does
35:14 that person work to get to be that good
35:18 now of course we can always turn on the
35:21 radio today and listen to trash and
35:24 realize well that is barely over barely
35:27 putting any effort in and you get a
35:28 record still they work their asses off
35:32 even to make rap and that's the truth
35:36 what if you go to a museum and you see a
35:38 just amazing work of art you actually do
35:41 sit in a Lamborghini and hopefully you
35:44 could take it around the block and
35:45 subtest drive or your buddy lets you
35:47 drive his and you realize it is the
35:50 modern ones especially our masterpieces
35:53 I mean the most amazing vehicles made on
35:57 this planet there's a ton of others that
35:59 are just as amazing but that's one of
36:01 them and see you think well Wow two
36:06 things is everything I'm doing in my
36:08 life up to this level of perfection and
36:11 detail and if not the great guess what
36:15 you got another thing for your list that
36:18 when you think you're done this is the
36:20 key in life right when you think you're
36:21 done you stop and go two things one kind
36:26 of make this particular idea the way
36:28 I've realized it better when I write
36:31 scripts this is what I have to do and
36:32 the thing I'm definitely have to do a
36:35 Mayan is go well should I be telling it
36:37 a completely different way and I mean
36:40 flush everything I've written down and
36:42 write a completely different script same
36:44 characters sting same controlling idea
36:47 same themes but achieve it in a
36:49 different way that might end up with the
36:51 finale that is more powerful than the
36:54 one I originally conceived typically you
36:59 will not conceive of the very best thing
37:01 in the world first sometimes that
37:04 happens they call it beginner's luck
37:07 right it does happen
37:08 think about all these bands that have a
37:10 one-hit wonder well what's the typical
37:13 archetype of a band with a one-hit
37:15 wonder
37:16 they just formed they've been playing
37:19 for a little while and pal
37:21 they created this one-hit wonder very
37:23 close to the beginning of their career
37:26 now there's a lot of bands that took a
37:28 lot longer to come together than then
37:30 history knows and they ended up creating
37:33 a you know whole album full of great
37:34 songs but think about a CD C's back in
37:38 black Bon Scott had just died Brian
37:42 Johnson comes in out of thin air they
37:46 write one of the best rock-and-roll
37:47 albums on planet earth that was on the
37:49 charts
37:49 for like 43 years did it fell off the
37:53 charts that I think it's back on it now
37:54 it's been in the top 100 albums on
37:56 planet Earth
37:57 I would love to know how much money
38:00 gross sales that album has made
38:01 individual songs it's amazing so things
38:05 can happen like that but that's sort of
38:08 like lightning in a bottle isn't it if
38:11 it happens well that's great but do you
38:14 know how to replicate it so inspiration
38:17 is what we want to get out of these
38:20 moments of jealousy you will always be
38:22 caught in moments of jealousy it just
38:25 happens it just happens men when you
38:28 were a kid you had it and even if you
38:30 weren't a kid that had a lot of it it
38:33 just meant you probably learned how to
38:34 control it very quick in your life what
38:38 I think society has lost in a really big
38:41 way because of the get rich fast BS
38:45 that's all over the Internet
38:47 you know these commercials that run
38:49 before videos on YouTube it's always the
38:53 guy in his garage with his Lamborghini
38:54 parked in the back or something and he's
38:56 like you know I'm really you think I'm
38:58 crazy if I told you something it was
39:01 impossible but it actually is and I've
39:03 got two friends and three friends let me
39:05 show you some screenshots of some BS
39:07 statistics that will never happen again
39:09 in history and that's the way you should
39:12 do it it's the lottery life I just
39:14 mentioned another episode okay you could
39:18 play the lottery every day I guess but
39:23 you know your odds are really low that
39:24 anything's going to happen in your favor
39:28 okay it's gonna make a lot of other
39:30 people rich but what I think we've lost
39:33 is this notion that you must attempt to
39:36 find what it is you really want in every
39:39 category of life which you know my table
39:43 of life it's the self work and family I
39:47 see it in that specific order because
39:49 usually that's how we incur life
39:51 you obviously are in your own skin first
39:54 you do have to get a job to pay the
39:56 bills if you're a man you're woman which
39:59 would be the third phase is going to
40:00 make sure you have a job before she
40:03 decides to spend the rest of her life
40:05 with you or attempt to do so so goes in
40:08 those three categories you know then you
40:11 you know in your family is really your
40:14 children and then that extends to you
40:16 becoming a grandparent and a great
40:18 grandparent until you exit this planet
40:21 now there are careers that you could
40:23 just go sign up for and they'll
40:25 completely take care of you go join the
40:27 military they have it all worked out you
40:31 could join the military have absolutely
40:32 no clue what you want to do with your
40:35 life and they will tell you what to do
40:37 they'll give you a career they'll test
40:38 you so yeah you're pretty good at this
40:40 you know very good at that if you go and
40:42 study somewhere else and get better it
40:44 will let you have a you know give you a
40:47 second chance on this other thing but
40:48 they pay you you know we take care of
40:51 our veterans better than we ever have on
40:52 planet earth now hopefully we're going
40:55 into an era of peace you can get in and
40:56 out of military without going getting
40:58 yourself killed but they'll take care of
41:00 you but if you are the predominant
41:05 majority you will go into private sector
41:09 or you will become a self-employed
41:12 person now as I always say you want to
41:17 go off into private sector I think first
41:19 to learn the pieces and parts unless
41:22 you're an utter savant you won't know
41:25 how to do you'll know how to make a
41:27 product or service but you won't
41:29 necessarily know how to do your
41:30 accounting and accountants are probably
41:33 and again if you think you're good I'm
41:35 not talking about you but I have never
41:37 met a good accountant in my life I have
41:40 met probably 70% of them are complete
41:42 fraudsters that will steal your money
41:45 manage your entire income incorrectly
41:48 proportionate to your timetable of
41:50 earning money and when you have to pay
41:51 your taxes they will disobey you and do
41:54 what they want why do you think so many
41:56 celebrities who have money end up suing
41:59 their accountants / managers because
42:03 they got had they're vultures men so you
42:07 better know about business before you
42:09 run off and do that if you want to
42:10 incorporate and hand out shares to
42:12 people boy you better know what you're
42:13 doing
42:14 and the reason why I'm going through
42:16 this in a jealousy episode is because
42:18 what is the alternative to being jealous
42:20 go make a plan you know a plan this is
42:26 really step two step one is to figure
42:29 out where's your goal what do you want
42:31 to do it could be anything a teeny tiny
42:34 thing it could be I need to clean my
42:36 bathroom floor oh god I hate doing that
42:39 because you know one week it's gonna be
42:41 just as disgusting as it is today it's
42:44 just a fact of life men and so instead
42:47 of fighting it you take care of it you
42:49 make it part of your Sunday ritual or
42:51 whatever some Monday's great you get all
42:53 your clothes clean and your bathrooms
42:55 clean your house is all right you've
42:57 vacuumed the floor you've washed your
42:59 sheets on your bed it's just you got to
43:02 have your paradigm be not a problem if
43:05 you've got to find out how you want to
43:07 either change your life or in some cases
43:11 a lot of you probably have the balance
43:14 already and you're just trying to
43:16 maintain well in that case your plan is
43:19 to maintain and believe me you need a
43:21 plan to maintain what you have because
43:24 stuff changes you know hopefully with
43:28 the change in America we are not going
43:30 to be facing a recession everyone's
43:32 bailed out of that notion except for
43:35 some mass media you know organizations
43:38 trying to follow the European recession
43:40 that's going on it looks like America is
43:43 gonna be okay for a while they wanted
43:47 another recession last year because they
43:49 will not let ten years pass without a
43:51 recession it's just the rule okay so if
43:56 you've got a good job and you're making
43:58 money don't get too you know don't rest
44:01 on your laurels as they say too much
44:04 because what'll take place is that the
44:06 economy will shift it could be that the
44:09 economy is doing great but whatever you
44:10 do gets replaced by a robot you get
44:13 older and your company simply looks at
44:15 you and goes hey you know I can get a
44:17 kid that's gonna make mistakes but he's
44:19 gonna be a lot cheaper than you if your
44:22 success is providing pockets of time
44:26 then you might go get more as you
44:28 patient in something something
44:30 completely different that actually could
44:32 make you money
44:33 and you will find that planning is you
44:37 know quite frankly one of the most
44:39 exciting parts of the game when I teach
44:42 college students usually in film schools
44:45 I will t I teach you know a few
44:51 different subjects one of them they love
44:53 me to talk about is the gaming industry
44:55 as it relates to film and television
44:56 because you're developing skills that
44:58 can actually contribute quite a bit to
45:00 storytelling in in cinematic control of
45:04 video games and so there's always an
45:05 opportunity for these kids to to have
45:08 that as an option right but I tell them
45:12 that all projects are divided up into
45:15 forty fifty nine and one first forty
45:19 percent of any project okay that's what
45:22 I call the fun forty
45:24 it's just planning its brainstorming and
45:28 it isn't the stage where you're actually
45:31 doing anything but you have to do it you
45:37 cannot make a video game with 20 other
45:39 people and not have a game plan it'll
45:43 just turn into mush it'll turn into
45:44 nothing you'll never be able to hit a
45:46 deadline because you you're not on the
45:48 same page about what you're creating
45:50 some guy thinks you're gonna have this
45:52 feature for the main character the
45:53 person is a completely different
45:54 perception if it's the designer versus
45:56 the programmer versus the artist imagine
45:59 the pieces that are missing then there's
46:01 the next 50% of the project and if
46:03 you're all by yourself this is going to
46:05 be very introverted experience but is
46:08 where you really find out what you're
46:10 made out of you watch all the employees
46:13 work on the next 50% which is the first
46:16 first step of the implementation itself
46:19 you'll find out who comes in late who
46:22 stays up late to get things done who
46:24 creates quality products who tries to
46:26 pass off crap as a finished product
46:28 without at least communicating a I just
46:31 put this together last night I had two
46:32 hours left before I went to bed this
46:34 isn't this is kind of sort of crap but
46:36 you get the idea that's okay but to pass
46:38 off something like that as a finished
46:40 product happens all the time
46:42 rookie kids and you can find out whether
46:45 or not you're gonna hire them for the
46:46 next project but then I have what's
46:49 called the brutal nine you're entering
46:51 the last ten percent of the project and
46:53 this is something I've talked about a
46:55 little bit but when you have a project
46:56 that you're going after
46:58 again we're not gonna be jealous anymore
47:00 we're gonna go get what we want this is
47:03 important
47:03 the brutal nine is if you're by yourself
47:06 it could be translated as the difficulty
47:10 rating of whatever you're trying to do
47:12 is so high that you're going to think
47:15 maybe maybe God doesn't want you to do
47:20 this when you're working with other
47:22 employees it is where you're going to
47:25 start getting emotional problems between
47:28 people typically people are going to be
47:30 extra tired they're going to be tired of
47:32 being locked into the project they can
47:33 see their future and some other projects
47:35 and they want out as soon as possible
47:37 and so everyone's snippy with each other
47:40 I usually tell my employees like look in
47:42 this face whatever anyone says the
47:45 defends you just don't take a don't take
47:47 a personal because we're all on that
47:48 stage of being exhausted if you have a
47:51 good day
47:52 lend your rested soul into a situation
47:56 to mediate and keep two people that are
47:59 at their wit's end from you know biting
48:01 each other's head off and the final
48:04 percent final percent excuse me I call
48:07 it the Last Man Standing which is this
48:10 and I've been through these phases quite
48:13 literally we're in that last percent
48:18 when you have to polish out the last
48:21 bugs in whatever you're doing
48:23 you know again if you're on a solo
48:25 mission it is literally trying to figure
48:28 out when you're finished with something
48:29 when I write by myself write my script
48:33 that I have designed completed by myself
48:34 I don't answer anyone else
48:36 it is me deciding when to stop rewriting
48:39 the script when is it good enough and
48:42 sometimes just you know getting rid of
48:45 the glaring issues and trying to polish
48:47 out and pace in your house for four
48:50 hours straight trying to figure out what
48:51 one word should be to get the right
48:53 thing communicated to the audience
48:55 eventually you have to close the door on
48:57 that script and put it away for at least
48:59 a month or two and you come back you'll
49:01 see glaring issues and it'll be much
49:02 easier for you but when you have to
49:04 deliver a product like a video game for
49:07 instance imagine imagine someone trying
49:09 to edit a big movie like a Star Wars
49:10 film and trying to figure out did we
49:12 clip everything we can clip should we
49:14 take that scene we cut put it back in I
49:16 mean that could go on forever but you
49:17 got to have a finish line otherwise it
49:20 just turns into this weird dream but
49:23 I've been in situations where there were
49:24 gosh you know 12 coders and other
49:28 participants testers working on a
49:30 particular product at the very end at
49:33 the very last day when we bless the
49:35 golden master this was for turbo tax way
49:37 back in today when used to be called
49:38 something else it was my boss and I
49:42 taking the golden master out to the
49:44 warehouse to make four or five copies of
49:48 it just in case you know something got
49:49 the disc got destroyed or something you
49:53 know it's not a hard drive with the
49:54 developer but we needed to start
49:57 duplication the very next day and back
49:59 in those days you didn't hire out
50:00 duplication of discs so they were
50:03 actually five and a quarter floppies we
50:05 actually know start three and a half
50:07 inch floppies we take every single
50:11 computer in the entire company
50:13 disconnected bring it all out to the
50:15 warehouse and put them in lines and then
50:17 a crew at night after everyone's gone
50:20 home starting as early as possible would
50:22 feed in the disk and wait for the copy
50:26 and when they finish the copy it eject
50:27 the disk and you pull it out and put it
50:29 in the finish pile and imagine trying to
50:30 keep track of all that and so we had
50:32 policies you know it doesn't get a label
50:34 until it's finished and that we looked
50:36 at a blank disk if you weren't sure you
50:38 just put it in and get it duplicated
50:40 again you didn't even look back you
50:42 didn't test to see if it had an app on
50:43 it you just and whatever just write on
50:45 it again so we would ship out you know
50:47 tens of thousands of these things that
50:50 we would labor over the weekend and at
50:52 night to do so let's go back to jealousy
50:56 and the pipeline of jealousy everything
50:59 in life is a pipeline it is the stages
51:03 at which something occurs and you manage
51:05 each stage differently
51:07 you know when you're cooking you have to
51:10 go buy the ingredients then you prepare
51:11 the ingredients then you mix the
51:13 ingredients then you put them in an oven
51:14 or put them on a stove and you died that
51:17 the and you're trying to tie them all
51:19 these different dishes at the right time
51:20 such that when the guests come over and
51:22 your family's ready to eat everything
51:24 finishes at this crescendo and it's all
51:26 done right the pipeline of jealousy is
51:29 usually one of these experiences where
51:32 you're having a normal day and it's not
51:35 something you wake up with you don't
51:37 wake up necessarily and there's a lot of
51:40 cases where you do let's just go out the
51:42 easier version of it but you're living
51:45 your day you're driving somewhere doing
51:48 something and whatever it is that you
51:50 desire it's all the sudden in your eyes
51:54 a person place or thing and you're gonna
51:57 be sort of in that stunned phase where
52:00 you're now seeing those visions from the
52:03 outside it's not truth from inside it's
52:05 stuff that's being projected at you
52:07 trying to get you all riled up now in
52:10 the past perhaps before this episode if
52:14 you hadn't managed it in the past you
52:17 probably fed into the black apple of
52:19 jealousy it was fed to you it was
52:22 offered to you and you bound and you
52:25 start dreaming about this and then you
52:27 go into kubler-ross thing about why you
52:29 don't have it your anger denial
52:32 negotiation and maybe acceptance of why
52:34 you don't have but usually jealousy
52:36 never has the acceptance phase you just
52:38 keep going in a loop well I don't have
52:40 it because I'm a certain race I don't
52:42 have it because my parents weren't rich
52:44 I don't have it because of this or
52:45 because of that maybe some of that's
52:48 correct maybe some of it's not correct
52:50 it doesn't change anything it doesn't
52:53 put it in your hands you know once
52:56 blaming somebody fixes the problem but
53:02 I'll believe in blaming people for
53:03 things well they might be the cause but
53:07 blame is a different thing blame is like
53:09 some sort of paycheck that's
53:12 proverbially attached to the exercise
53:15 the pipeline of blame is - I just need
53:18 to inform this person that they're so
53:19 responsible for
53:21 problem and then someone outside me is
53:24 gonna fix his problem for me it usually
53:27 doesn't work
53:28 I mentioned this once before an episode
53:32 many many years ago but Will Smith of
53:35 all people he's a Scientologist I don't
53:38 know if he got to some Scientology or if
53:40 he got this from his own experience but
53:42 you know he said look when you don't
53:47 have something that you want he says the
53:51 only way you can get what you want is to
53:54 go get it and devise a plan and take
53:56 steps because nobody out there this is
53:59 what I always tell people because it's
54:00 been my experience as I observe both my
54:02 reality and other people's reality if
54:05 you have someone in your life that
54:06 really supports you in a way that
54:08 actually takes tasks off your list of
54:11 things to do then you're the luckiest
54:14 person on the planet period but I think
54:17 99.9% of us don't have anyone like that
54:20 in our life as a matter of fact due to
54:23 jealousy unmanaged in society we have
54:25 haters everywhere and you might have a
54:29 best friend who plays the best friend
54:32 role and says all the things the best
54:34 friend should say but in the end they
54:37 are really jealous of you and they
54:39 really hate any progress report that you
54:41 can bring to the table that is you being
54:44 closer to getting your goal I write
54:46 scripts ok so who could support me in a
54:52 way that's gonna write my script for me
54:54 nobody nobody I gotta do it myself I
54:59 have to inspire myself every day when I
55:01 get up so when we get ourselves caught
55:04 in that loop you want to stop and
55:08 realize wait I don't want this emotion
55:10 to get out of hand because it gets out
55:12 of hand immediately that's how you feel
55:13 in the first place try to turn jealousy
55:17 into inspiration hmm maybe I want that
55:21 thing maybe I really do want that thing
55:23 you look at that car that has a $25,000
55:26 brake job price and a $1,200 oil change
55:29 price and the license plate on the front
55:32 cost 20 grand a year
55:34 and yeah I want to I want those problems
55:37 in my life
55:38 from the buddy mines looking for homes
55:41 to to move into in the next year or two
55:44 so he's looking to leave California and
55:47 which i think is nuts when you grow up
55:49 one place your whole life it's a little
55:52 naive to think you can just change your
55:53 environment it's all gonna be great but
55:54 okay let's say that's good for him but
55:57 he's looking all these homes and their
55:59 brand-new homes that are for sale
56:00 sometimes their homes that are really
56:02 super modern very decent price but
56:04 they're in South America and I look at
56:07 those places and I think you know some
56:09 of these places are really modern and
56:11 they're very cold you know their whole
56:13 personality is just very yeesh it's like
56:16 living inside a tin box it's really
56:17 strange a nice pool and some cool little
56:20 movie theater here and there but in the
56:22 end you're kind of like man unless
56:24 you're married with married with a
56:27 family or you have a lot of close
56:29 friends being in this big gigantic
56:32 container by yourself would only
56:34 reinforce the one defect that he's
56:36 trying to get rid of which is being by
56:38 himself imagine writing a movie or
56:42 someone maybe you maybe one hour short
56:46 maybe it's a black mirror or something
56:48 where someone is finding themselves an
56:52 extremely envious situation and through
56:56 some device through some magic wand
56:59 mechanism of the episode they are given
57:02 the one-time opportunity maybe by the
57:04 devil to swap consciousness maybe even
57:09 there's a bunch of funny movies there's
57:11 even a funny video that does this but
57:14 you can swap consciousness with the guy
57:16 or girl or you can get rid of them they
57:19 just simply disappear your body vanishes
57:22 whatever you don't like your life anyway
57:24 and so you go into this other person's
57:26 body they got the big house the fancy
57:29 car seems like they've got a I'm al just
57:32 do it from a male perspective seems like
57:34 they have the hot wife as they say and
57:38 you suddenly get in that person's life
57:39 and you wake up and you're like oh my
57:40 god is great you're stretching in bed
57:42 and yeah she's right there and in a
57:46 second she rolls over
57:48 she's hideous maybe as a person you the
57:53 phone rings and you pick it up and you
57:55 it's someone from the credit card
57:58 company asking you why you haven't paid
58:01 your credit card which is sixty thousand
58:04 dollars and climbing pure interest rates
58:08 you have no more credit and this happens
58:10 all day there's four or five cards
58:12 you're finding out your two or three
58:13 hundred thousand dollars in debt you go
58:16 to the kitchen and you find an envelope
58:17 that's been opened already with piece of
58:19 paper on top and it's got a big red
58:21 writing on it and it's a foreclosure
58:23 notice through very quick dialogue with
58:27 your wife you realize your parents are
58:30 dead and no one is coming to your rescue
58:33 but where you were before you had a life
58:37 a job maybe you'd be a little bit of
58:40 debt but not much and you could have
58:43 stayed in your world but you thought
58:44 that grass was greener on the other side
58:46 and you just got a big dose of WoW
58:50 jealousy just screwed me over completely
58:54 and maybe the guy you knows got a
58:57 doctor's appointment that day and he's
58:58 got cancer I mean he just you know you
59:01 never know what you're getting into when
59:03 you try to live someone else's life I'll
59:06 tell you one thing that I reared
59:08 experience I had where I learned about
59:09 exotic cars I have a friend of mine
59:13 who's very wealthy real estate guy and
59:17 as a side thing he dealt with exotic
59:20 cars and he had some amazing cars think
59:23 he still has about half a dozen wild
59:26 cars man but he had some famous cars two
59:29 owned by famous people and these cars
59:31 were probably 150 to 300 thousand
59:35 dollars and they were brand-new but then
59:37 he would walk around and tell me what he
59:39 bought him for he's an Alice Cooper car
59:43 it's just wild chopped top I think it's
59:45 a Chrysler 300 but as like I don't know
59:48 like a half a dozen to a dozen TVs in
59:52 and I mean it's this wild car you gotta
59:55 feel like you know I don't know if I can
59:58 say I think got rid of it but it's like
59:59 20 grand something like that
60:01 20
60:01 five something there but probably cost
60:04 Alice you know I don't know 150 hundred
60:06 two hundred fifty to have it made the
60:08 cars were going off the Lots around here
60:10 for like ten to 15 over sticker because
60:13 everybody wanted one
60:14 you know there's Ferraris you can get
60:17 for nothing because these owners are
60:19 like this is a money pit it this
60:21 particular year was rough the you know
60:24 it's not it's the engines unreliable
60:25 electrical systems all screwed up and
60:28 you know people own these vehicles and
60:31 if they get them on the road and make
60:32 them look good for a weekend and then
60:34 they have to park them for six months
60:36 because they stopped working what are
60:38 you jealous of you know so let's talk
60:42 about the probably highest level of
60:45 jealousy which is a little bit tougher
60:47 to plan to fix and that would be your
60:53 life is more than fifty percent over
60:57 depending on what how old you might end
60:59 up being and you look around at young
61:03 people and you think my god
61:06 what I wouldn't give to be young again
61:09 maybe you had a hard life a really tough
61:13 one and it's still tough because you
61:15 know life just some in some perspectives
61:18 it gets tougher and tougher as you get
61:21 older your health doesn't necessarily
61:23 get better as you get older right
61:24 your eyesight doesn't improve let me
61:26 tell you that much and so you sort of
61:31 allow yourself to live in a virtual
61:35 world of what could have been that's a
61:39 tough one I probably will have a version
61:45 of that but I was able to do more than I
61:50 ever imagined with my lifetimes for at
61:52 least but what I find because I smoke
61:55 cigars right and when you go to a smoke
61:58 lounge where they smoke cigars you bump
62:01 into all these different people mine's
62:02 not like any other Lounge on planet
62:04 earth - I would put it this way if
62:09 you're a deep lover of deep thoughts you
62:13 would find my smoked lounge
62:15 to probably be a euphoric place for an
62:18 afternoon because we talk about all this
62:21 stuff but I run into a bunch of people
62:23 that I never see again and they come in
62:25 and they you know one guy will come in
62:27 and have a cigar in two seconds he's
62:29 talking about his ex-wife and now he's
62:32 in the middle of the divorce or he just
62:33 finally got his divorce settlement
62:34 worked out or how these kids are no good
62:38 or you know there's business partners
62:40 you know screwed him over or whatever
62:42 but you know what's fascinating about it
62:45 is it matter how bad someone's story is
62:48 typically the conversation will evolve
62:51 where they start talking about wonderful
62:55 moments in their life yeah they may have
62:59 wanted you know 10 times the amount of
63:03 these in moments but these moments are
63:05 priceless and you know most of them kind
63:10 of get to the point where you get the
63:11 sense they would do nothing to change
63:14 those moments from occurring like don't
63:17 change anything because if you change
63:19 anything these things won't happen you
63:21 know one of the most fascinating things
63:23 that happens to a parent and you can be
63:26 a male or female it doesn't matter
63:27 you'll have a child with someone that
63:30 you eventually end up falling apart or
63:33 separating from and you really don't
63:36 like them and maybe you realize you
63:39 didn't like them a lot but you tolerated
63:41 some bad condition thinking it might get
63:44 better and then you have a child but the
63:48 child turns out pretty awesome because
63:50 you had a role on how that kid perceived
63:54 reality you know sometimes you're the
63:57 parent that paid more attention to the
63:59 child so it's the child's just de-facto
64:01 more like you my hope for you is that if
64:05 you're in that situation the separation
64:07 itself allows you to mend your
64:09 relationship with the other person at
64:10 least to a tolerable level you know you
64:14 see this stuff portrayed in all kinds of
64:16 series I mean what was it Goliath is the
64:20 new series on Amazon I think right it's
64:23 in his third season now that was a heavy
64:25 part of the first season I believe
64:29 but you know I guess in the last few
64:31 minutes here the thing I want you to do
64:36 is to reject these whole paradigms of
64:42 thought it doesn't mean by me saying
64:45 that and you agreeing yeah let's do that
64:48 that it's not going to happen to you
64:50 again it's almost like here's a stupid
64:54 analogy but it's like you like to lay
64:56 out next to pools you don't like to lay
64:57 out on patios without water next to you
65:00 like water but when you're laying out
65:03 you don't want to be wet you don't mind
65:05 swimming but when you're laying out you
65:07 don't want to be wet and there's always
65:09 someone jumping in and there's always
65:10 someone splashing somebody and there's
65:12 always people think it's funny to splash
65:14 you and let's just say you're a
65:16 sensitive person to that it's gonna
65:19 happen if you sit next to a pool it's
65:22 gonna happen you got accepted and you
65:26 know just try to do your best sit in a
65:29 place that doesn't get splashed that
65:31 much maybe let people know not to splash
65:34 you know whatever it is they're just
65:35 accepted so that because it doesn't kill
65:36 you
65:37 it doesn't mess up your tan right I
65:40 think there was definitely a transition
65:42 in my own life where I was sort of being
65:47 manipulated by jealousy I mean again I
65:50 shared the story when I was a kid I lost
65:51 my high school sweetheart because my
65:53 jealousy was the most infinitesimal
65:57 acidic jealousy you could ever have as a
66:00 human being and I just didn't know how
66:03 to manage it I didn't even know I mean I
66:05 knew it was happening I guess but I just
66:07 I was just surrendering to these black
66:10 apples constantly ryeom's and visioning
66:13 things that weren't actually happening
66:15 I was sensationalizing things that I did
66:19 see happen into things that they weren't
66:21 you know and when I got out of that it
66:24 helped me in life and then as I
66:26 succeeded of course I because I knew
66:30 what it was like to have nothing as a
66:32 kid when I started having things I was
66:36 very sympathetic to anyone around me
66:38 that didn't have these things and so you
66:41 know I did I was just telling some
66:45 friends of mine the other day I finally
66:48 laid down some money and bought a nice
66:49 car a very nice car and it was for me
66:54 because I was gonna was starting a new
66:56 business in Los Angeles and I was gonna
66:58 have to drive one hour on a good day to
67:01 work and had a nine at 9:00 a.m. daily
67:04 meeting so I had to be there on time and
67:06 he if we relate the Wester it was very
67:08 upset with those okay but I started
67:12 getting a little worried because i i i i
67:15 have forgotten exactly how this occurred
67:17 but there were moments in the first year
67:19 where i noticed that you know if i
67:22 pulled up in this car I would get looks
67:26 that weren't exactly positive looks at
67:30 my smoked lounge we ended up watching a
67:33 series that somebody edited together a
67:35 bunch of videos where people with nice
67:37 cars like really $100,000
67:39 you know $200,000 300 thousand dollar
67:41 cars were have you know people in LA who
67:45 were on bicycles throw stuff at these
67:47 cars one guy jumped a fence to scratch
67:50 up Lamborghini I mean what kind of
67:52 person does that I mean that's like
67:54 jealousy that is just eating this person
67:57 alive I mean perhaps there was some
67:59 personal thing between them didn't seem
68:02 like it but the haters can get insane
68:05 and so I felt self-conscious for quite a
68:09 while until I started to accept the fact
68:11 that it's like look ok I worked really
68:12 hard this is the one thing I have that I
68:16 think is the most expensive object I've
68:18 ever bought in my life so it you know
68:20 not full of all this and I'm very humble
68:23 about it but sometimes you don't have
68:25 any opportunity to communicate that
68:27 that's how you perceive it but there was
68:30 a threshold in my life and I don't
68:31 remember when it happened where I
68:35 finally stopped and I'm not a really I'm
68:41 not that materialistic at all I mean you
68:42 guys have seen the same t-shirts and
68:45 pullovers like little hoodies here for
68:47 the four year straight you know I'm not
68:49 out there trying to impress anybody like
68:52 that
68:53 but you know what I think I dunno when
68:55 it happened I made music for a long time
68:59 in the 90s like I've said did a few
69:02 video game soundtracks have ended up
69:04 doing sound effects eventually but I
69:06 kept getting jobs and kept cranking out
69:09 music for all kinds of private projects
69:12 weddings and presentations and all this
69:14 other stuff and finally I pushed out my
69:17 studio to probably I was dropping mad
69:19 money on stuff it was ridiculous but all
69:22 one of my little apartment nobody knew I
69:23 had need these things except the guy was
69:25 breaking all the money at the music
69:26 store but I think I got it up to like
69:30 thirty-five thousand dollars worth of
69:31 new stuff big mixing board brand new
69:34 keyboards synthesizers software
69:37 computers all this stuff and then the
69:40 job stopped coming my buddy who was
69:44 hiring me a lot for his game company
69:45 well that game company went out of
69:47 business and there was this moment of
69:50 just like lucidity of looking at all
69:52 this crap and I moved twice with this
69:55 stuff sight of Paulo de round twice
69:57 which was very painful
69:59 it wasn't being turned on to do anything
70:01 and so in this software also got super
70:05 complex at one point is there
70:06 interfering with the fluidity of making
70:08 music and I just kind of looked at my
70:12 possessions and I kind of got grossed
70:14 out by my own consumerism I didn't buy
70:18 it when I needed it I bought it with the
70:20 notion that I would need it thinking it
70:23 would extend my capabilities having you
70:25 know millions of sounds that I could do
70:27 which ended up making it impossible to
70:31 pick the candy bar out of the freaking
70:33 vending machine you know what you got
70:35 for candy bars in there it's pretty easy
70:36 to make a decision when you have 40
70:38 candy bars in there you're standing
70:40 there for 10 minutes in candy bar
70:42 selection anxiety right I hope you get
70:45 to a point at some point in your life
70:47 where you do see that you have enough
70:50 stuff you have what you need that's
70:52 really all you need you know when you
70:55 see people live in third-world countries
70:56 in these little you know huts I mean in
70:59 China they rent cages actual cages that
71:03 we would use for perhaps a large dog
71:06 in your living room people live in these
71:09 cages for 150 bucks a month and you
71:13 think and you're like okay
71:15 that for me would be the most
71:17 claustrophobic thing I've ever
71:19 experienced in my life I would literally
71:21 feel like I have devolved down to an
71:24 animal but at some point these people
71:27 decided that's all they needed because
71:30 the kids in Japan that live at these
71:32 Scouter sort of we work kind of places
71:33 right where they're like supposed to be
71:35 offices but you can rent these places 24
71:38 hours a day it's sleeping these little
71:41 cubicles
71:42 and it's they've proven that at least
71:45 you can you can live at least an era of
71:48 your life in these very limited
71:50 conditions it is my hope of course that
71:53 this sort of stuff is not necessary in
71:57 the future but they're making home
71:58 smaller and smaller and smaller aren't
72:00 they you want to undermine jealousy by
72:04 taking control of your life so that
72:07 there's nothing you can be jealous of
72:09 and the second you feel it I want you to
72:12 smile disarm it and if you can turn it
72:16 into inspiration if it is something you
72:18 really really want maybe even laugh out
72:22 loud if you thought for a second you
72:24 needed that and then you think it
72:25 through and you realized oh my god I
72:27 totally don't want that that would be
72:29 ridiculous level of burden on my life I
72:31 like my life to be very simple I've been
72:34 in a number of my friends houses and
72:36 businesses at the exact moment in time
72:40 when they had to write their monthly
72:41 checks and it's usually I've come over
72:44 and either from a dating the girl that's
72:46 doing it who's very wealthy or as a
72:50 business buddy of mine who's you know
72:53 some real estate mogul guy and I see
72:56 them signing these checks because they
72:58 have to sign these checks to hand it to
72:59 their accountant so we can go eat lunch
73:00 or hang out for the night or whatever it
73:03 is right and it's like ten thousand here
73:06 twelve dozen here and watching like
73:08 sometimes it's a bunch of checks to
73:10 family who don't have jobs that are just
73:12 living off of this stash of cash that
73:14 this one person's been able to manifest
73:16 permanently removing it from her
73:19 or his bank account such that if they
73:23 ever have a rainy day they may not have
73:25 that money and I look at those problems
73:29 and I say me and I'm glad I lived the
73:32 life I live which I think that's about
73:35 it again we feel it all the time we
73:41 never talk about it
73:42 therefore it's an episode that's how
73:44 these episodes work and then or they're
73:47 not as sexy as the other ones but you
73:50 might find they're actually more
73:52 valuable and stay with you a lot longer
73:54 than the what NASA did 1969 type episode
73:57 you know we'll make more of those too if
74:01 you haven't been to deep thoughts
74:02 radio.com
74:03 please go I will make a short bumper
74:05 today there's two video - audio - social
74:08 media two ways to donate I do put up a
74:12 couple other links for donations their
74:15 affiliate links that I products that I
74:17 personally use one is the Backblaze
74:20 backup system online I'll tell you what
74:22 I don't care if there was no affiliate
74:26 program with that it is five bucks a
74:30 month for infinite to drive or two sorry
74:33 two computers infinite drives and you
74:36 can have it backed up 24 hours a day it
74:38 has recently completely saved me as the
74:42 Catalina beta ended up erasing 360 gigs
74:46 of photos off my computer without my
74:49 knowledge like months ago it did it and
74:51 so I went back up on Backblaze looked up
74:54 July was the last time I had it and
74:57 prepared it for download you just
74:58 prepared for download they give you a
75:00 little app to download it really fast
75:01 and man it saved my bacon amazing so I
75:05 don't care if we were just friends this
75:08 is a product you should get screw all
75:10 that iCloud crap and all these
75:13 pay-for-play stuff even drop boxes ten
75:15 times more expensive than back plays
75:18 when you really get it up to the
75:19 professional level so that's another way
75:22 to do it if you're looking for a season
75:25 one episodes in this channel they don't
75:26 exist I'm starting to put the season 1
75:29 link in the description down below so
75:31 this this video
75:32 have it I need to go back and update 400
75:34 videos with the refresh bumper text so
75:38 you can have it but just go to the
75:39 website there's season 1 link up there
75:40 it's another channel it's all remastered
75:43 blah blah blah
75:44 no no ads whatsoever so it's cool and if
75:48 you find any episodes missing [ __ ]
75:51 shoot has the first 400 episodes I still
75:56 haven't finished as of this exact moment
75:58 putting up all of season 5 stuff that
76:01 we've made so far so but you get over
76:04 there it's uncensored it's fantastic
76:06 it's in 1080p so it's great
76:08 downloads quickly so definitely get on
76:11 to that one as well I haven't found a
76:12 single other service like [ __ ] shoot if
76:16 they're trying to say they're this big
76:18 freedom channel like bright tea on its a
76:22 joke it's fully censored by design screw
76:25 those guys the other channels only have
76:28 one hour limits and so [ __ ] shoot so
76:31 far is the best YouTube replacement
76:33 let's hopefully cross our fingers and
76:35 get over there make an account so they
76:37 know you exists so we don't lose this
76:39 great opportunity it's a shared
76:41 distributed computer network kind of
76:45 like a BitTorrent so you get all the
76:47 videos from all kinds of different
76:48 computers but until next time take care
76:52 of yourself and someone else that I'll
76:53 see in the next deep thoughts over now
