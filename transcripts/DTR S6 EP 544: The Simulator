00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen
00:37 so it's about uh 1 20 at night
00:41 am had a long day
00:44 doing all kinds of different stuff and i
00:47 want to share
00:49 an episode that it's going to sound like
00:53 it
00:53 well it might sound convoluted but what
00:56 i'm about to tell you
00:57 is something i have been consciously
00:59 thinking of
01:01 for i don't know 15 20 years i'm not
01:04 sure i've been able to complete
01:06 a 48 hour period without
01:09 studying this in my head and i
01:12 guess i'll call the episode maybe like
01:14 the simulator or something like that
01:17 and it stems from being raised on the
01:19 movie
01:21 probably two movies and then hearing
01:24 about a television show okay
01:27 gosh it's probably a whole stretch of
01:28 stuff
01:30 i saw brainstorm with christopher walken
01:33 natalie wood
01:35 nurse ratchet i forgot her real name and
01:40 it's about a machine that you could put
01:41 on your head
01:42 that record your entire five cents
01:45 matrix and if
01:49 the person you know as soon as someone
01:50 gets done records it and they give it to
01:52 you
01:53 and if you were a boy you could feel
01:54 what it's like to be a girl
01:57 vice versa if someone had sex
02:00 but in their life they were
02:05 past their age of having sex
02:10 he could revitalize them by giving them
02:12 a new perspective
02:13 it was everything it's one of the most
02:15 brilliant science fiction movies
02:17 ever made it's natalie wood's last movie
02:20 absolutely if you are a science fiction
02:23 person
02:24 meaning more fact based
02:27 movies like a blade runner or something
02:30 this movie is 100
02:31 for you get a copy or watch it somewhere
02:34 streaming right
02:35 brainstorm i think it was meant to be
02:37 shot in 3d
02:39 so the credits are going to start kind
02:40 of going at you but i don't think they
02:42 paid to
02:42 have it done because back in the day
02:45 they either had to film in 3d or wasn't
02:46 going to be in 3d there was no
02:48 easy way to post process it into 3d
02:51 be fun to take the negative and do it
02:54 the second movie is total recall
02:56 with arnold schwarzenegger 88.89
02:58 somewhere in there
03:00 probably can't rightfully
03:04 ignore the matrix although that would be
03:06 just a little bit of like a
03:08 a hint of salt and my father told me he
03:11 saw this
03:12 show on tv and some of you will have
03:14 seen it i never saw it i saw like frames
03:16 of it
03:18 i might get the name wrong i'm not going
03:20 to look it up
03:21 keep this all freestyle but i believe
03:23 the show was called mission to mars
03:26 but when you watched the show it was
03:27 like a starsky and hutch show but it was
03:29 a modern starsky and hut show
03:32 somewhere in the 20th century 21st
03:34 century excuse me
03:36 it was just kind of weird but my dad
03:38 told me that at the end of the show
03:41 the big twist was that these dudes who
03:46 are starsky and hutch are actually
03:47 playing a video game
03:49 or some type of game and because they're
03:51 on a mission to mars they're in a
03:54 spacecraft for a really long time and
03:56 this is the way they preoccupy
03:57 themselves is to get into the simulator
04:00 now any of you who are star trek buffs
04:02 will also dial in the
04:03 holodeck now
04:07 how many of you are sort of blown away
04:10 by how the simpsons
04:13 seems to predict way too much stuff
04:17 both really evil things and really funny
04:19 things all at the same time
04:22 my friend told his partner right before
04:24 he died
04:25 when his partner asked him
04:28 do you think he'll try to you know
04:30 contact me from the side
04:33 and he said when you see the unicorn
04:36 that's me and within a couple days
04:40 his partner went downstairs and watched
04:41 the simpsons
04:43 sure enough there's a unicorn in the
04:45 episode it is not a butt of a joke
04:47 according to my buddy and it's just
04:50 sitting there
04:52 it's not a part of the show the simpsons
04:54 think about it
04:56 because oh my god there he is so
05:01 you know we've all well in the last
05:03 three and a half years or so we've been
05:04 told by a particular movement online
05:06 that
05:07 we are indeed watching a movie all right
05:12 how many of you look at your life and
05:14 you're like man it started off really
05:16 good but as i got older and i learned
05:18 about
05:19 theories of the world those theories of
05:21 the world seem to kind of
05:23 overtake my reality why
05:26 how i mean one or two and
05:30 50 60 70 100 years yeah yeah sure
05:33 but every decade there's two or three
05:37 you're about to succeed you're about to
05:38 make all this amazing money you're about
05:40 to get this ventured
05:41 bam you get cut down now if someone were
05:45 watching your life
05:46 in a movie well that's exactly what the
05:49 writer's
05:50 goal is is to create what robert mckee
05:52 calls a gap
05:54 your character wants to cross the street
05:56 with the chicken men
05:58 chicken goes across no problem because
06:00 he's not the main character
06:01 as the main character tries to cross the
06:02 street oh my god there's an earthquake
06:05 the street rips open now there's a chasm
06:08 between
06:09 this side and the other side now the
06:11 character has to find a way to get
06:13 across the street
06:15 which was before an absolute cinch but
06:18 it would have been a bore
06:19 for the viewers had you crossed the
06:22 street real easily
06:23 for you would have been great you would
06:24 have gotten to your goal
06:26 do we have proof that we're living in a
06:29 movie
06:31 way beyond some insinuation
06:34 that politicians are just actors and
06:39 we're having smoke blowing up our holes
06:41 all day long by mass media
06:43 forget all those fools what if we are
06:47 truly
06:48 either it's one of two things
06:52 at least as a as a lead
06:55 category to our kingdom phylum order
06:59 class thing right we're either souls
07:03 punching into this world which is a
07:05 little odd because the soul is always
07:08 sort of theoretically without
07:12 a mass body until it connects with one
07:16 or are we already some physical being
07:19 and we're using a machine either it's
07:22 entertainment
07:24 pacification and a long trip to mars
07:28 or something else something very
07:31 interesting
07:32 i just realized so
07:35 you know i know other humans on this
07:37 planet uh other than just listeners
07:40 but i love you guys the most there is a
07:44 an interesting question i get strictly
07:47 from females
07:50 because i meet lots of artists and all
07:52 kinds of folks right
07:53 i try to build up a good
07:56 friendship circle of people that are
07:58 doing the same thing i'm doing but doing
07:59 it way better so i get inspired every
08:01 day when i look at their posts
08:03 but the women will always ask me why do
08:05 you wear sunglasses on your show
08:07 now some of the dudes do as well
08:11 but the women do it ten to one over men
08:14 dudes you're like yeah i get what he's
08:15 doing yeah he's got this thing and maybe
08:17 some of you recognize that i'm doing it
08:19 for um
08:21 i did it as a daytime thing and i do it
08:24 as a nighttime thing because it's my
08:25 kiss makeup
08:26 it's how you know me why do girls ask
08:30 for
08:31 that sort of i need to see your face
08:34 we're not having a relationship
08:36 necessarily they just want to say i am
08:38 i'm gonna only trust you on a personal
08:40 level
08:42 if i can see your eyes because the eyes
08:44 are the window to the soul
08:46 creepy narrow eyes or creepy eyes
08:50 because someone's personality's bleeding
08:52 through their eye sockets
08:55 it's important to a woman it's part of
08:56 that species
08:58 evaluation software where she's kind of
09:02 looking at you you know
09:04 and it could go the opposite i don't
09:05 know i don't get really bent out of
09:07 shape if i see a girl
09:08 wearing sunglasses the entire time
09:11 what's really interesting is
09:12 this was just a serendipitous thing it
09:15 does
09:16 block facial recognition software to a
09:19 degree
09:20 but it's just a way you know me i've
09:23 worn sunglasses habitually
09:25 since i started buying them in the
09:27 mid-80s as a kid because my
09:30 uncle's an optometrist i could get
09:32 really expensive glasses for nothing
09:34 i'm a connoisseur of sunglasses maybe
09:37 one day i'll do an episode with my
09:38 collection of glasses that'll blow your
09:39 mind
09:41 i think i've only lost two pairs my
09:42 entire lifetime
09:44 one on a lake and two dragging in uh
09:48 shopping carts at walmart for some
09:51 reason i
09:52 i didn't have them on i had them on my
09:55 clothing or something and i was
09:56 in a pocket or something and they were
09:58 really expensive and
10:00 it's snowing outside and i'm pulling in
10:02 you know dozens of shopping carts which
10:04 by the way if any of you haven't pulled
10:05 in shopping carts in the snow
10:07 none of the wheels turn it's really fun
10:10 but back to the simulation
10:12 i got i've given you guys this little
10:14 trick you og listeners you know this
10:18 i'm gonna tell you if you haven't done
10:19 this in real life with someone
10:21 it it's an instantaneous thing that
10:24 people go oh my god
10:26 what are you a wizard
10:29 but i realized that staring into
10:30 someone's eyes is a super important
10:32 little thing
10:34 and so i came up with this little
10:37 example
10:39 of how important that is especially in
10:41 real life as opposed to some stupid zoom
10:43 call
10:45 zoom and skype and all these things it's
10:46 pure death to the human consciousness of
10:48 man
10:50 you need physical connection
10:53 but if you hold up your index finger and
10:56 you block the eyes with it
10:57 it's in the video i'm doing it with
10:59 myself
11:00 but if i sit with you across the room
11:04 and i use my finger just to block our
11:06 eyeballs connecting
11:07 so you no longer see my eyeballs the
11:10 amount of human connection that you lose
11:12 is
11:12 in my opinion about 97 to 99
11:16 you feel it immediately you feel like
11:19 you're staring at a prop
11:20 all of a sudden a mannequin
11:23 you know when you catch someone asleep
11:26 it's a very interesting process their
11:29 sleep their eyes are closed
11:31 now especially works with very peaceful
11:33 sleepers
11:34 they don't wake up violently and i dated
11:37 a girl once that man she would wake up
11:39 violently and it was like i don't know
11:42 what happened to her when she was a kid
11:43 i don't know
11:44 i know her parents nothing there
11:47 but someone who wakes up really nice and
11:49 soft and their eyes just go
11:51 oh hey honey you know there's this magic
11:55 when you wake someone up and their eyes
11:58 come out of dreamland and they look at
11:59 you and they're happy to see you
12:01 your little kids man it's priceless
12:05 hey sweetie wake up you know and you're
12:07 you're her guardian you're
12:10 her world and you're waking up in a
12:12 beautiful way
12:13 or he and him or whatever you know my
12:16 buddy
12:17 brought his two sons to the smoke lounge
12:18 tonight it was the cutest freaking
12:20 moment ever
12:21 just two little boys two and five or two
12:24 and four
12:25 but yeah just incredible i have been
12:28 plagued with
12:29 this thought the reason why the eyes are
12:33 so powerful in this world
12:36 because you hear it and you know it's
12:37 true you do the block test and you're
12:39 like yeah it's true
12:40 why is that i've mentioned this a couple
12:44 times and
12:44 many many years ago
12:48 what if the game starts off like this
12:51 the only thing that we allow as a
12:54 recognizing mechanism
12:56 from the other side in this simulation
13:01 are the eyes of who we are so if you see
13:05 my eyes
13:06 you're seeing the real me if i see your
13:10 eyes
13:10 i'm seeing the real you although in
13:13 photograph
13:14 it is merely
13:17 it's almost just like an indicator of
13:20 who i am
13:21 but you're not really experiencing me it
13:24 doesn't matter if i film myself an ak at
13:26 40 frames a second
13:29 it'll feel better than maybe 1080p
13:33 but it ain't as good as just sitting
13:35 across the room from me
13:37 or we're having a conversation at a
13:39 dinner table or something
13:41 something very intense about that but i
13:44 mentioned the simpsons for a very
13:46 specific reason
13:48 now we know that hollywood
13:51 is a machine
13:56 that used to just tell great stories and
13:59 now
13:59 has been utterly co-opted to try and
14:01 engineer humanity
14:04 it is the most despicable goal
14:08 because you shouldn't be trying to mess
14:09 with people's minds like that
14:12 now moral upticks and that kind of stuff
14:14 where you're telling the age-old
14:16 story of be good be good be good
14:19 common law do no harm that stuff is fine
14:23 basic archetypes of which you have to
14:25 apply to your life and find the reason
14:26 to apply to your life
14:28 but someone trying to go in and destroy
14:30 your identity
14:32 who you are as a person to tell you who
14:34 to hate and who to like
14:36 where to be angry and where to be happy
14:40 those are awful awful things to be doing
14:43 to other people
14:46 unless i guess if you wrap it in a
14:48 complete
14:49 fictional thing and you're sort of
14:53 making fun of it
14:55 where you cross the line of normality
14:58 you say oh we that's what we did that's
15:00 what this movie's about is uh
15:02 crossing the lines of normal
15:04 communication it's a little twisty for
15:05 your brain but in the end
15:07 the hero goes you shouldn't be doing
15:09 that leave us all alone
15:11 and so you come away from the theater
15:13 going man this is
15:15 weird man that guy was messing with
15:16 everyone's life should do that
15:19 and so you double down on the fact that
15:21 you're a sovereign being
15:22 with your own rights right we're not
15:25 going to get into some tyranny
15:26 conversation
15:28 look how many movies have these things
15:31 where i'm getting sort of this stream of
15:34 consciousness which
15:35 is probably coming out of science
15:36 fiction books
15:38 or anyone who just sits around for a
15:40 long time thinking you know
15:42 i'm at an age now where maybe writers
15:44 back in the 80s of my same
15:45 age or maybe late 70s they were having
15:49 the same thoughts because they were at
15:50 the same level development they read the
15:52 same kind of books that i read
15:54 or maybe they even wrote them and so it
15:56 was a natural progress
15:59 i see brainstorm i see total recall
16:02 i see the matrix my dad watches the mars
16:05 thing
16:07 you and i have hundreds and hundreds of
16:10 conversations about this
16:12 but now the question starts to arise
16:16 do i know you do i know you from
16:19 our real world which is why you're
16:22 really watching me
16:23 if you're a fake person as you mentioned
16:25 in the
16:26 instant earth theory episode well then
16:29 you're not real
16:30 and you're not listening
16:33 but if you really are there you're not
16:35 an npc
16:37 you're a real being no
16:41 whether or not we're a human on the
16:43 other side
16:44 it seems like that would make sense
16:47 but there's another thing that that's
16:50 always
16:51 maybe question things which is why do
16:55 babies cry
16:58 now usually it's it's hunger
17:01 fatigue or boredom as a parent that's
17:04 what i discovered
17:05 once i catered to those three conditions
17:07 i could keep my kid from crying
17:08 now my kid wasn't a big crier i mean
17:11 there was a point though when she was
17:13 little little little there's no logic to
17:15 the crying it just happens i used to
17:16 play her
17:17 rob zombie or white zombie or whatever
17:19 it was and she just started sleeping
17:21 just the more methodical bonus tracks on
17:24 the albums
17:26 but the reason why i mentioned the
17:27 crying thing is
17:30 it sort of stems from a bunch of
17:32 possibilities
17:34 one of the possibilities is you've been
17:36 born
17:37 into the game now you were
17:41 something else before you were born into
17:43 this game
17:46 and so maybe you're frustrated with oh
17:48 my god i'm a baby again
17:50 this is weird maybe it's that you were
17:54 something completely different your
17:56 life design was completely different
17:59 right like
18:00 maybe you weren't human and so now
18:03 you're in this
18:04 two-legged two two-armed thing
18:08 and even humans themselves could freak
18:10 you out
18:12 and you gotta get used to it it's like
18:14 the twilight zone where the girl keeps
18:15 getting the surgery to get fixed
18:19 and they keep telling her you know don't
18:20 worry we've got a whole
18:22 you know section of the world just in
18:24 case this doesn't work you can go live
18:25 with them and they're all like you
18:26 and she's like oh my god don't even say
18:28 that and of course they
18:30 take the bandages off her face she's
18:33 gorgeous men and all the other people
18:35 look freaky
18:36 like dj high tech from d'antvert
18:40 you use that mask from the twilight zone
18:42 as a
18:43 way to deal with the zegor uh agrophobia
18:48 agoraphobia and then this handsome guy
18:51 comes in to her and says hey you know
18:52 we've got a whole place where we live
18:54 you said chill out that's good he's
18:56 super handsome she's super beautiful and
18:58 you're thinking oh my god it's like a
18:59 paradise wherever they do live
19:01 but she set a standard in her mind that
19:03 she's supposed to be this other ugly
19:04 thing
19:06 uh if you've ever raised a kid or you
19:09 had a brother or sister
19:10 or a neighbor or whatever and you
19:14 understand
19:15 how how little you actually interact
19:18 with the kid
19:20 in terms of what they see versus what
19:23 they do the monkey see monkey do
19:25 algorithm my friend's son was
19:28 two years old tonight big kid for his
19:32 age
19:33 and you know my kids started feeding a
19:37 baby
19:38 doll at six months man we'd say where's
19:41 your baby
19:42 and she'd crawl over and find the baby
19:44 and say can you feed the baby
19:45 and she'd go find the bottle somewhere
19:47 in this big pile of toys in the middle
19:49 the room and she'd feed the baby
19:51 six months then we'd say put the baby to
19:54 sleep
19:55 she'd go find a blanket and she put the
19:56 baby asleep she can't even talk
19:58 she's crawling it's weird
20:02 she was born in february she's walking
20:04 by thanksgiving so nine months
20:06 she wasn't only walking she was dancing
20:09 to a thing it's like okay
20:12 the parents we didn't say okay here's
20:14 how you dance
20:15 here's how you walk course she's seeing
20:16 us walk
20:18 but there's something about
20:21 the age of the soul that's going into
20:23 these
20:24 vessels the matrix one of the biggest
20:27 contributions to this conversation that
20:29 the matrix
20:30 the matrix movie sort of participates in
20:33 is
20:34 not just the idea that neo's in this
20:36 full-blown
20:37 video game and then he pops out and he
20:39 has all these you know things pulled off
20:40 his body
20:41 but it's the deja vu effect a glitch in
20:44 the system
20:45 it is true that if the software ever
20:47 hiccuped on itself
20:49 it looped around some information how
20:52 many of you have watched
20:54 a video on youtube and it got a little
20:57 out of sync or you're watching a
20:59 movie file on your computer and it got a
21:00 little out of sync and it starts to
21:03 just every once while it just repeats a
21:04 certain area of the video like it felt
21:06 like it got so out of sync
21:08 that whatever it did displaying the
21:10 pixels and the
21:11 in the information to you it needs to
21:13 really go back and give you another
21:14 chance to see it because it's screwed up
21:16 when i watch taxi with my buddy if we
21:19 don't use the vlc player
21:21 it does that you'll see how it keeps it
21:24 pretty good
21:26 hmm interesting i have this weird
21:31 i don't know instinct vision
21:35 that perhaps this is what's going on
21:38 that it is several layers
21:41 up between you and god
21:45 me and god there are
21:50 simulation layers and and think about
21:52 this
21:53 for everyone who's so pissed off about
21:56 what shape the world is
21:58 i think someone asking me if i'm a flat
22:00 earther which just recently happened is
22:02 almost like saying
22:03 tell me what you think about abortion
22:06 it's like don't worry about it don't
22:08 worry about what i think watch out my
22:09 episodes you'll know exactly what i
22:11 think
22:11 i'm an expanding earth person but again
22:14 i'm also an open-minded intelligent
22:16 person
22:16 and i like hearing everyone's opinion
22:19 every person's opinion the concave or
22:22 earth opinion because i'm not looking
22:25 for a fight i'm not looking to make
22:27 enemies in this world
22:28 to somehow muster up some opinion that
22:32 i have value in this world i know guys
22:35 who post on facebook
22:37 just giant pardon my french [ __ ] you
22:40 post to everyone
22:42 that they know in this world it's like
22:44 that gives them value somehow and they
22:46 don't lament about anything that they do
22:48 believe they just say
22:49 i'm this and if you don't believe this
22:52 then you're stupid and say okay well
22:54 dude why do you believe that
22:55 don't worry about what i believe i just
22:57 believe this and say okay
22:59 okay good luck with that little tiny
23:02 friend list
23:03 you know i have to unfollow those guys
23:05 i'll let them
23:06 be friends with me but i unfollowed them
23:07 because i want to see their
23:09 just useless posts it's like dude
23:13 go read a book would you because if
23:15 you're going to post 22 times a year
23:17 that you're this particular thing and
23:19 everybody else is an idiot
23:20 at least share one [ __ ] sentence
23:24 that is you showing you have a brain and
23:27 not just a bias
23:28 assholeness up to you you know it's just
23:31 weird
23:32 it's just i don't get humanity sometimes
23:34 man
23:35 it's only like one out of like a
23:37 thousand people do this
23:40 but it's so visceral and so acidic
23:43 you just gotta go unfollow man we could
23:47 have had a conversation
23:49 but you won't read and you won't study
23:52 all you want to do is feel smart with no
23:55 research
23:55 no nothing right odd
23:58 but if we're in some sort of
24:02 game mechanism as a mere
24:05 tool to survive perhaps a prolonged
24:07 journey
24:08 a prolonged life then
24:13 it doesn't matter where we are and what
24:16 if
24:17 let's let's advance up from so what
24:19 brainstorm does is it gives
24:20 us a platform for us to discuss things
24:23 they have figured out how to record
24:25 and play back or broadcast live
24:28 like an unreal video game all your
24:30 senses
24:31 and you can interact with it it's kind
24:33 of cool right
24:35 but you go up to total recall and it's
24:38 one of these things where the dude was
24:39 selling him
24:41 packages you want to be a certain thing
24:45 you want to be president okay so you
24:48 might think well
24:49 why don't i have my own simulation where
24:52 just like in various twilight zones
24:54 there's the twilight zone with the uh
24:55 mr wickwire and it was a
24:59 as a foreign asteroid where these
25:01 astronauts land
25:03 and they it's like earth but they're
25:06 really far away from earth and they're
25:08 looking around it's like they find
25:10 humans fishing and winning beauty
25:13 pageants becoming mayor and a bunch of
25:15 other cool stuff
25:16 but everyone's frozen until they
25:19 bump into mr wickwire mr wickwire is a
25:22 robot
25:23 looks like an old man and uh
25:27 it's a cemetery it's a cemetery where
25:30 you get put into a
25:34 position that you always wanted to be in
25:36 in your lifetime you are in the
25:38 afterlife
25:40 well i should say as much your body is
25:42 celebrated the way you
25:43 always want you want to be a rock star
25:45 when you're on stage man you're the
25:47 fifth member of kiss you know
25:49 now that would be you in the simulation
25:53 sort of by yourself with as many
25:56 artificial friends
25:59 and you would get your way the entire
26:01 time it'd be like you
26:02 being i don't know one of these like
26:04 steven spielberg's it just is on level
26:06 one the guy just falls uphill
26:09 but we're frustrated because we think
26:11 we're surrounded by a bunch of devious
26:12 people
26:13 that i've been lamenting over and over i
26:15 just did it
26:16 in the episode about you know i'm always
26:17 since i saw westworld it was like oh my
26:19 god
26:20 that could be us right but now what if
26:22 we're sharing
26:23 theaters it's just like a multi-player
26:26 online game like world of warcraft or
26:28 something
26:29 sure there's a bunch of npcs but there
26:32 are
26:34 thousands and millions of other players
26:37 in that world
26:38 with you except unlike world of warcraft
26:41 where
26:43 your biggest inconvenience bumping into
26:45 another person would be
26:46 you were going to kill that monster
26:48 because it's part of what you have to do
26:49 and they killed it first and then you
26:51 gotta start and wait for a respawn
26:53 for them to come back oh no we're gonna
26:55 kill it you know
26:57 that's a minor inconvenience but what if
26:59 in this world
27:01 it's they get to be president and they
27:04 don't know what the hell they're doing
27:06 and so they screw the whole place up but
27:09 you have to be on the plane when they
27:10 crash it into the ground because all
27:12 they wanted to do is be a pilot
27:13 just like those people to post online
27:15 with no research
27:16 and no words to contribute to their
27:20 their passion supposedly their
27:23 absent profoundness
27:26 these people just fly the plane right in
27:27 the ground they run the countries into
27:29 the ground
27:30 they're sort of idiots that are coming
27:34 in saying i want to play that role
27:37 you know how many times have you had
27:39 that situation happen where
27:40 as a kid you all agreed to do something
27:44 together and
27:46 one of the dumbest kids wants the
27:47 biggest position because all they want
27:49 is the biggest position they don't want
27:50 to have to learn how to do anything
27:52 i want to be the captain of the team but
27:53 do you even know the rules of this game
27:56 no but i want to be the captain of the
27:57 team because it's ego ego ego
27:59 i hate the mirror boom you know that the
28:03 smarter you get in this world
28:04 the more isolated you get the more you
28:06 do research the more isolated you get
28:10 because even if a person has a degree in
28:12 something it's very
28:13 short-lived they only wanted to learn is
28:16 the minimum amount they wanted that they
28:17 needed to learn
28:18 to get the degree but they as soon as
28:21 they hit graduation
28:24 so many people with degrees go i'm glad
28:26 that's over
28:27 i never want to read another piece of
28:29 this crap again i just want to
28:31 go to work look up something on a table
28:35 prescribe a drug and go home and do
28:38 whatever i do
28:40 whereas you and i were like
28:43 this doesn't end ever
28:47 we're gonna be learning to the day our
28:48 brain cease to work
28:50 and because we don't relax our brains
28:54 are like arnold schwarzenegger's chest
28:57 until we die so this simulation
29:01 for me explains how
29:05 there's so much um gosh
29:09 you know we used to call it uh
29:10 predictive programming
29:13 but there is predictive programming and
29:15 then there's prophecy
29:18 in my opinion the simpsons have been
29:23 more prophetic and more prophecy
29:27 showing you things that are absolutely
29:29 insane
29:30 the donald trump and his wife coming
29:32 down the escalator being president
29:35 that's not predictive programming that's
29:37 prophecy
29:39 the dude with the horns or ran into the
29:42 capitol building well he's in a
29:43 he's in the capitol building in a
29:45 cartoon
29:47 now you know one could say okay that guy
29:49 dressed up like the simpsons dude
29:51 the capitol building thing uh kobe dying
29:54 in a helicopter
29:56 911. bart holding up the
30:00 was it the nine dollar magazine or nine
30:02 city magazine with the two towers and
30:04 i mean it's just like come on it gets to
30:07 be
30:08 fairly insane any one of you have broken
30:10 down the back to the future
30:12 association with 9 11.
30:16 and it makes you wonder do we not have
30:18 enough money on the outside world if
30:20 this was true
30:21 to buy the good solutions
30:24 and so we're still living in a class
30:26 structure so even when we have an
30:27 entertainment
30:29 goggle on the rich
30:32 idiots they're the ones running the
30:35 world into the ground
30:37 because they're aristocratic darwin
30:39 people
30:41 don't want to figure out anything
30:43 remember darwin stole everything from de
30:45 la mark
30:46 couldn't understand epigenetics so he
30:47 went with something that every caveman
30:49 understood which is survival of the
30:50 fittest nothing profound
30:52 the guy was a complete hack from start
30:54 to finish
30:56 predictive programming for me is more
30:57 like black mirror
30:59 black mirror showed you the social
31:00 credit system and here it is
31:03 in america it's cancelled culture but in
31:06 china it's straight up
31:09 either do what the communist chinese
31:11 party says
31:13 or we will remove all of your privileges
31:16 so they're leveraging this kovid stuff
31:18 against us to
31:20 do a big portion of the united states of
31:23 course the idiots all line up
31:26 but the other part is just cancel
31:28 culture you better
31:30 kiss the feet of the doctor and
31:33 the clockwork orange otherwise you're
31:36 gonna have problems
31:38 they'll come cancel you the idea about
31:42 the instant earth theory
31:44 and this theory mixed together starts to
31:46 explain some stuff
31:49 i mean it's sort of silly but we want to
31:52 go down every rabbit hole in my opinion
31:55 this is definitely rabbit hole
31:57 the world looks like it's been used over
31:59 and over and over again for different
32:01 levels of society
32:03 i still can't explain certain things
32:08 you know people with modern equipment
32:10 building
32:12 sort of i don't want to say inferior but
32:14 definitely
32:16 bizarre structures
32:21 of which if you could build the
32:22 equipment to make the structures you
32:24 wouldn't build the structures
32:26 unless again you're perhaps beckoning
32:28 back to a time before that and i'll give
32:30 you an example
32:33 we know the pyramids exist in 2021
32:37 if whatever reason levitation became
32:40 something we could do
32:42 and the drilling equipment
32:46 the circular saw equipment was very
32:49 easy to get a hold of and easy to power
32:52 and whatever reason we don't even have a
32:53 monetary system anymore
32:55 we're just all chill all those scumbags
32:57 are dead
32:59 well what if we're sitting in kansas and
33:01 we're like you know what we've got
33:02 stone quarries all over kansas we do so
33:05 what we're going to do
33:07 just as a challenge is try to rebuild
33:11 pre-dynastic egypt in kansas
33:14 just to see if we can it's all it is and
33:17 we don't quite know exactly how they did
33:18 it so we're
33:20 making mistakes and we're doing stuff so
33:21 we got a lot of spare rocks we throw off
33:23 to the side
33:24 with circular saw marks and bore hole
33:26 marks and other things
33:28 beautiful contoured stuff because for
33:31 whatever reason that equipment's now
33:32 been
33:32 developed then we die
33:35 because it happens and the game keeps it
33:39 in the system like a minecraft game
33:41 whatever he builds in there it's there
33:44 and then a thousand years later ten
33:48 thousand years later this program just
33:49 keeps going and going and going
33:52 believe me in a hundred years people are
33:54 going to be playing world of warcraft
33:58 1.0 2004 release
34:01 just for the fun of it they're just
34:03 going to do it some retro thing
34:04 plenty of people play old atari 2600
34:07 games today in 2021 and the
34:10 platforms over 40 years old
34:13 it's just fun it's nostalgic
34:16 so what if all that stuff that is
34:18 triggering our brain to think man
34:20 how old is this place it's all just a
34:24 bunch of pre-uses
34:25 of this game this entertainment platform
34:30 i had an idea
34:33 i was uh was it last night when i got in
34:36 bed
34:37 and i was thinking about the mandela
34:39 effect
34:41 and the fact that you know they blame
34:42 the cern hadron collider for the mandela
34:44 effect
34:45 one because some of the cern employees
34:47 were definitely playing some games
34:49 taking some pictures i don't know which
34:52 one came first
34:54 but now imagine you've got a quantum
34:55 computer
34:57 not the nonsensical future seeing
35:01 project looking glass things simon parks
35:02 talks about but a real quantum computer
35:05 and you have secured 500 cubits which is
35:09 200 more than you need
35:10 and now you have a computer that can
35:12 technically conceive of
35:14 every ethereal particle in a near
35:17 infinite universe
35:19 it can build a zany wob universe in in
35:22 your office
35:24 go see hijacker's guide for that one now
35:26 imagine
35:28 if you get a computer that's brilliant
35:31 and a quantum computer again conceives
35:33 of everything at the same exact time
35:35 it doesn't have a linear path that it
35:37 must go down to figure something out
35:39 necessarily it can conceive
35:41 technically with this very small sample
35:44 of fairy cake let's just say
35:46 it can conceive of the rest of the
35:47 universe by reverse engineering
35:50 through an ingestion mechanism algorithm
35:54 the butterfly effect effect in the
35:56 opposite polarity
35:59 it looks at the price of tea in china
36:01 and tells you where the
36:03 butterfly will be in peru
36:09 now once you have a sampling that's
36:10 correct you can go the other way
36:14 but you're still just observing in a
36:16 quantum computer
36:19 but now imagine you've got a certain
36:20 hadron collider
36:23 was it 17 miles around or it's between
36:26 switzerland and france it's the biggest
36:27 machine man's ever made
36:30 absolutely complex slinging around
36:32 protons
36:34 apparently but you also have this giant
36:37 ring with a couple other
36:41 side rings and you use a quantum
36:44 computer
36:47 to create impacts or electromagnetic
36:50 pulses at
36:50 massive levels to
36:54 then bump into all of the
36:57 atomic mass that we can get our hands on
37:00 bump into
37:00 right with this machine and it starts to
37:03 create a ripple effect
37:05 to change things now you're changing
37:08 time
37:09 i don't know it could technically
37:12 you know i don't know it'd be
37:14 interesting to see okay
37:17 it's a big-ass machine in the middle of
37:18 nowhere i'll just give you some silly
37:20 examples
37:22 but uh you think about baron stain
37:25 becoming berenstein
37:29 which is actually it's the opposite but
37:31 imagine okay so you have berenstein's
37:32 everywhere and you want to make a bear
37:33 in stains
37:35 people will remember the other one but
37:37 once you start running into a problem
37:39 where you can't find the berenstein book
37:40 because it doesn't exist you're like
37:42 [ __ ]
37:43 that's a that's a mandela effect but now
37:46 what if
37:47 your house at your place
37:50 of existence is white
37:53 it's white why is it white
37:57 it's white because when light hits it
37:59 and bounces into your eyeball
38:01 you get the full spectrum of the rainbow
38:05 but now let's just say i'm sitting in
38:08 this hadron collider
38:11 and i got this quantum computer
38:13 controlling
38:14 every minute function of this
38:18 thing i may be slamming
38:21 protons together but that's just to
38:23 create electromagnetic
38:24 wave it could be doing a lot more things
38:27 i'm just not going to tell you
38:29 so you can't find out
38:32 but from switzerland france
38:35 you live in say toledo ohio
38:38 i got your address in google earth
38:42 i know you live you got a white house
38:46 i am going to tell this quantum computer
38:48 that i want your house to be red
38:49 tomorrow
38:51 why would it be red all of a sudden well
38:54 because the paint
38:55 when light reflects off of it it's going
38:56 to send a frequency of red into your eye
39:00 so i need to change the molecular
39:02 structure of the paint on your house
39:05 but nothing else on your house not even
39:07 the trim is going to change
39:09 you're still going to have white trim
39:10 you're still going to have
39:12 maybe some off gray shingles on the top
39:16 i just want to hit your paint on your
39:18 house seems impossible right
39:22 but the quantum computer can think about
39:24 the entire
39:26 sphere or flat disc or whatever
39:29 of earth and i can bump this thing
39:33 sends a wave somehow where it's just
39:35 saying i'm going to put out a
39:37 almost like a mushroom cloud of
39:39 electromagnetic pulse
39:42 but it's designed to ricochet off
39:44 everything so
39:45 perfectly that by the time it bounces
39:48 off the paint on your house
39:51 it changes the paint on your house and
39:53 it turns red
39:55 now for any of you who remember
39:57 computers back in the day
39:59 and some of you hackers today you'll be
40:01 very aware of this
40:03 i want you to keep in mind if you're not
40:04 a programmer you're not a technical
40:06 person just
40:06 in the back of your head what i'm about
40:08 to describe to you is how
40:10 if this is a software driven solution
40:12 that we're playing with
40:15 giving us the illusion we have this
40:17 tangible mass right
40:19 well every particle theoretical
40:23 that makes up who we are is in some
40:26 memory somewhere
40:28 probably nothing like anything that we
40:30 have on planet earth you know
40:31 it's not a memory stick it's probably
40:34 some holographic cube
40:36 or something else it's in a qubit or
40:39 it's some other
40:40 ancillary piece of hardware that the
40:41 qubits program
40:43 to store positives and negatives ones
40:45 and zeros right
40:47 so imagine you could just hack the
40:49 system
40:50 from here we create something
40:55 that hacks the game from inside the game
40:58 and many of you have done this right
41:00 you'll have a
41:02 there's just a hack there's something
41:03 you can do where one of the big things
41:05 we used to do
41:06 in world of warcraft was you would find
41:07 a rip
41:09 in the ground and if you stepped in it
41:12 because it's 3d all of a sudden it's a
41:14 blank polygon
41:16 and you start falling you can fall
41:18 forever lots of video games had this
41:19 problem we first started creating
41:21 3d games because the polygons would have
41:24 ripping
41:25 it's pretty much solved i haven't seen
41:27 it in a really long time
41:29 sometimes you'll load a game up on your
41:30 computer well has the problem as well
41:33 where it takes so long to load the
41:34 textures and the geometry that
41:36 for a little while on your computer
41:39 everything's transparent and strange you
41:41 can start seeing through layers of the
41:43 ground and you start seeing stuff you're
41:44 not supposed to see
41:45 until it fills in after loading it off
41:48 the hard drive
41:49 i'm going to continue on this path a
41:50 little bit longer here because i think
41:52 there's some interesting analogies here
41:55 so some of us have had these
41:57 supernatural experiences
41:59 loved ones who pass who come to tell us
42:01 that i'm okay now
42:04 what if that's nothing more than the
42:06 loved one
42:07 coming up to your little cubicle in the
42:09 outside world
42:12 and whispering it into your ear and then
42:15 your mind
42:15 imagines something it's in your mind's
42:17 eye it's not where you could see it if
42:18 you were here with me
42:21 but then you're suddenly like oh my god
42:22 i just saw my grandmother i saw walt
42:24 disney
42:26 maybe that guy was a real player he was
42:28 an amazing player he does all this crazy
42:30 stuff
42:31 other players got jealous and bumped him
42:34 off or whatever
42:36 smoked too much right founder of
42:38 adventure right
42:40 um but how many of you have seen
42:44 and some of you we have about 96 men
42:47 so i apologize ladies there are games
42:50 out there
42:51 where people create these videos like
42:53 rust is an amazing game
42:56 and people do these raids and you'll
42:57 have someone flying around filming the
42:59 raid between two factions
43:01 tons of real people in this fake world
43:05 but one guy is in god mode and he flies
43:08 around
43:09 he'll even talk to the characters no one
43:11 can hit him
43:14 he can't participate it's really kind of
43:17 freaky because the guy could actually
43:18 tell on
43:19 you know some information it's almost
43:21 like looking everyone's poker cards and
43:22 saying that guy's got an ac you better
43:24 get something better in your hand
43:26 but there's a gag mode that you can play
43:29 but
43:29 you're flying around this world in god
43:30 mode imagine that's just a spirit
43:34 coming up to you it's like hey what's
43:36 going on
43:38 you're like what what what the hell was
43:40 that a ufo what the hell was that
43:43 it's just like uh will rights game
43:47 spores
43:50 maybe we're living in a complete echo of
43:52 what we're actually
43:53 in because it's sort of after a while
43:56 you gain a certain level of intelligence
43:58 and by us creating computers
44:00 and games inside computers isn't it
44:02 interesting that you can
44:03 you can argue with every single computer
44:06 person but even the
44:08 the television show computer chronicles
44:11 with uh
44:13 was it gary kildare they asked him once
44:16 you know what do you think you think
44:17 games are going to be real popular on
44:19 this new machine and
44:20 gary's like games are the reason why
44:22 these machines are getting faster in the
44:24 personal computer realm
44:25 it's not businesses asking for them to
44:27 be faster that government does its own
44:29 thing with super computers
44:30 but in the personal computer realm
44:32 without games nobody wants a video card
44:34 to be faster they don't need more ram
44:36 they need more megahertz
44:40 we've not tasted it those of you who
44:42 have seen the unreal
44:43 5 game engine demo
44:48 my god we are i'm going to tell you
44:52 my estimation is that in 10 years
44:56 the next version unreal 6 which i'm just
44:58 making this up
45:01 i'll be surprised if there's a single
45:03 thing that you can't
45:05 that you can distinguish between reality
45:06 but i guarantee you in 20 years
45:09 reality will be a headset away
45:13 from being you being in this universe
45:16 i'm talking about
45:18 a hundred years from now
45:21 it'll be honda p 100 percent
45:25 this reality is going to exist inside a
45:28 computer
45:29 in a hundred years now the only question
45:33 which i think brainstorm
45:38 brainstorm is you know it's it's about a
45:40 laboratory a private laboratory
45:43 funded by the government creates this
45:45 tape that records all your emotions and
45:47 all your
45:47 all your senses everything a heart
45:49 attack a dream everything
45:52 we think the united states government
45:53 saw that movie and didn't go
45:56 make it so i think for
46:00 sure probably russia and the united
46:03 states
46:03 alone said make it so
46:07 so you know when we get these crepazoids
46:09 out of the government
46:12 and they exist man they got on mcveigh
46:14 tom mcveigh
46:16 or tim mcvey right sorry tom mcfaze the
46:19 pretty predictive programming character
46:22 and they'll tell you you know i can make
46:24 you think anything i want you to think
46:27 you thinking oh mk ultra some crazy
46:30 drugs and
46:31 m16s in your gut and all this other word
46:33 stuff
46:35 well what if they give you a shock
46:38 treatment
46:39 which is going to pretty much make you
46:41 devoid of a lot of
46:43 your current electrical state in your
46:44 brain you're going to go back to zero
46:46 and then when you wake
46:47 up without you knowing it you're
46:50 living in a machine that is doing the
46:53 brainstorm effect but it's not a
46:55 playback tape
46:56 it's an unreal engine and you
46:59 just wake up and accept
47:03 what the engine tells you you're doing
47:05 so you feel like you're moving your
47:06 hands in your legs and
47:08 having a conversation but you're really
47:09 just in a
47:11 stasis pod somewhere in a paralysis
47:15 of some sort maybe a chemical paralysis
47:17 that keep your body
47:19 incapable of moving so you start
47:22 accepting everything
47:24 we have this letter on the internet that
47:27 keeps talking about
47:28 all these miraculous things occurring
47:30 which i think we can
47:32 flush about 80 percent of that down the
47:34 drain
47:35 but still if you even kept 20 of it
47:39 the idea is that dude was a game no
47:42 matter if he's real or not it was a larp
47:45 a live-action role-playing exercise
47:48 whether it turns into a real thing
47:50 because it programs you to take on
47:52 the enemy then it would be real like if
47:55 you said hey
47:56 do you realize you're a slave but you
47:58 think you're free
48:00 what i feel really free yeah i know you
48:02 think you feel free but you're really
48:04 not let me show you
48:05 bing bing bing bing bing and you're like
48:06 oh my god i'm in this crazy simulation
48:09 and i
48:10 i don't really have free choice maybe
48:12 it's a prison
48:14 but if you were a bastard in the outside
48:16 world they're like okay you need
48:18 instead of putting you in jail where
48:19 you're going to go fight everybody and
48:20 kill everybody
48:21 what we're going to do is um we're going
48:24 to put you in as a real character in
48:26 this game
48:26 bunch of people are fake but you're a
48:28 real one
48:29 and you can leave this simulation once
48:32 you demonstrate
48:33 that your brain your soul the real you
48:37 can coexist with other people and get
48:39 along
48:41 we could live for something stand for
48:42 something instead of standing for
48:44 nothing
48:44 and the more that you live this life
48:46 just to get your rocks
48:48 off and and to serve number one
48:51 as long as you get yours gotta be
48:53 careful with that
48:55 what if that's just a sentence to come
48:57 back
48:59 why is it that some people are so
49:00 empathetic and others just
49:02 don't give a [ __ ] about anybody else in
49:04 the world
49:06 and these aren't necessarily world
49:07 leaders these are people you know
49:10 some people are really broken in their
49:11 minds but they're sweet people
49:13 but they're formidable they're big
49:16 bruiser people
49:18 you got to be careful it can't make them
49:19 angry make them angry they'll kill you
49:22 they don't necessarily want to but
49:24 they're fragile
49:27 well they need they're getting their
49:28 rehabilitation potentially in this
49:30 simulation
49:32 where they do actually technically do no
49:35 harm
49:37 we struggle as human beings with the
49:40 loss of life
49:42 especially young life it seems
49:45 unconscionably
49:47 ungodly to allow a child who has done no
49:50 harm to anyone
49:52 to leave early but god would do that
49:58 well if this is a game one of two things
50:02 could be true
50:03 probably several things could be true
50:05 your child
50:07 uh is alive and well and perfectly fine
50:10 which is probably where i would lean
50:13 but their situation is you know they
50:16 could be in there
50:17 let's just say we're still living some
50:18 sort of
50:20 well i didn't want to say that we have a
50:22 life span on the other side that's
50:23 really short but
50:24 let's just say for the sake of argument
50:25 where you still live 100 years on the
50:27 other side
50:28 before something miraculous happens
50:31 and you're sentenced to this system to
50:34 get your [ __ ] together
50:36 because you were sort of a bastard on
50:37 the outside
50:40 you just have a little flaw but that
50:41 flaw just gets out of hand you know
50:44 so you see your daughter your son is
50:47 actually in their 20s and 30s 40s
50:48 whatever
50:49 they're living a good life and you know
50:52 it could be like these black mirror
50:54 episodes where
50:55 for you it seems like you're living a
50:57 full extra life inside this machine
51:01 but they come down as your kid and part
51:04 of the test is
51:05 do you value life and if you lose it
51:09 i mean not yours but someone you love
51:11 how do you react
51:13 can you be a good person after this
51:15 horrific event occurs
51:16 because that's what the system needs to
51:17 know about you do you pass the test it's
51:20 almost like a
51:22 psychological captain kirk test
51:26 so your kid is in the simulation with
51:28 you born as your child
51:30 that is really your child their real
51:32 being they love you to death
51:34 and nothing's ever going to change that
51:36 and they're not really dead
51:39 but in this world they didn't make it
51:42 but it was an orchestrated event to see
51:45 how you would deal with it
51:47 or maybe a bunch of people deal with it
51:50 maybe you're just a victim of having to
51:51 deal with it because someone else in
51:53 your circle
51:53 has to figure it out second thing could
51:57 be
51:58 you do have a kid but that one in the in
52:01 this world was
52:02 a placeholder it mirrored
52:05 very accurately the child that you know
52:10 but the system won't allow it's quite
52:13 literally
52:14 anyone to die for real your kid won't
52:17 die
52:18 it's not allowed but if you perceive
52:21 them to die
52:22 it feels just the same and by engaging
52:25 all of your senses which may be way more
52:27 than this
52:28 this lame fight since they tell us about
52:31 right
52:33 the system's watching you now let me
52:37 freak you out a little bit more
52:38 in a good way i guess
52:42 we know that we're trying to write in
52:44 this world artificial intelligence to
52:46 behave like humans
52:48 and that's the toughest tallest order
52:50 because you have to give a machine
52:52 equal senses of a man to start even
52:55 behaving like man
52:57 but one thing that would be a lot easier
52:59 to do if it's a
53:01 big system looking down on you
53:04 would not be to emulate you
53:08 or emulate an npc of some sort
53:11 but to simply watch you in this world
53:14 and record what you have done to then
53:16 assess you
53:17 on particular intervals that person
53:20 was very nice to this other person it
53:22 didn't have to be
53:24 they gave a buck or two to a homeless
53:26 person didn't have to but they did
53:29 they held the door for someone they sat
53:32 up at night
53:32 worried about a friend they went checked
53:35 on their
53:36 child just to make sure they're okay
53:39 they were extra friendly to a spouse
53:43 they never stepped on anyone's head to
53:45 get ahead
53:46 the system could just watch you it's not
53:49 exactly that intelligent
53:51 the only thing that's required to make
53:53 that happen is that the computer has to
53:54 be able to observe you
53:56 and to listen to what you say remember
54:00 what we talked about
54:01 and many times about laws of attraction
54:04 if you simply think it in your head
54:08 it's not usually enough you must analog
54:11 your thoughts outside of your body you
54:13 must put them in written form
54:15 and then stuff happens way way faster
54:19 the inspirational board thing you put on
54:21 the
54:22 wall everything physically that you want
54:25 in this world i got a friend of mine she
54:26 does this
54:28 okay that allows this ai
54:32 to see what you're doing so that it can
54:34 provide you
54:36 easily with what you're desiring but if
54:38 you sit there and just think about it
54:40 what's really going on is it's your real
54:42 mind in the other world
54:44 that's punching through and having this
54:46 experience here but the ai
54:48 in this video game has no idea what the
54:49 hell you're thinking just like world of
54:51 warcraft
54:53 can't possibly know what i'm thinking
54:55 about sitting in my
54:56 office playing the game which today is
54:59 extremely awful and i just cancel my
55:01 subscription
55:04 what do we do in this world with babies
55:07 so they become equipped to function in
55:11 this world
55:13 well we know that bad parenting ruins
55:15 the entire world
55:17 the biggest problems we've ever
55:21 raised in this world always stem from
55:23 really bad parents
55:25 almost in every occasion and it it's not
55:28 always
55:29 a parent beating a child and turning
55:30 them into a monster a lot of parents are
55:33 just neglectful
55:34 but they love their kids dearly they
55:36 give them too much stuff
55:38 and so they become incapable of taking
55:42 care of themselves and as
55:44 their parents die off they can't deal
55:45 with the universe and so they tend to
55:47 steal and
55:48 and become craft human beings
55:52 but now remember i mean it's going to
55:53 get real esoteric for you guys but
55:55 this is the real me and how i think man
55:58 i've told you guys several times that i
56:00 see
56:00 overlay universes on this universe all
56:03 the time
56:04 now i haven't had the physical
56:07 [Music]
56:09 overlay in probably about a year
56:13 last one i remember i was driving on the
56:15 405 south it was an overcast day and
56:17 there's an area between here and irvine
56:19 there's a lot of lush foliage on the
56:22 side of the highway for whatever reason
56:24 when it's overcast and
56:25 i'm in those junctions i
56:28 get the burst of the overlay it is a
56:31 completely different universe
56:33 but it's it's still human beings and we
56:35 are just
56:37 all of us driving down the highway we're
56:39 all in it to win it i mean there's no
56:42 evil in this world it's just this
56:44 amazing
56:45 feeling but there's no angels flying in
56:47 the air anything it's still a real world
56:50 but i get that but since i've been
56:53 telling you that i've been getting these
56:54 things
56:56 it's evolved the other thing i get is
57:00 bursts uh especially when i'm about to
57:02 go to bed
57:04 but it happens throughout the day as
57:06 well i get bursts of these other
57:08 universes
57:09 and there's like about like i've always
57:11 told you guys about six or so
57:15 i don't know if they're all the same
57:16 maybe they're 6 000 or 6 million or
57:18 whatever
57:19 but i feel like there's just this
57:21 there's a few universes i remember
57:24 i remember living there i remember
57:26 having a family there i remember being a
57:28 kid there
57:30 it's a biz a bizarre sort of memory of
57:33 an entire life
57:35 but you have to understand that
57:37 everything i'm seeing
57:39 as far as i know is in the future
57:42 and it's never existed on earth it's
57:44 sort of how i feel about it
57:47 and so i you know i sit and concentrate
57:50 on these things
57:51 i try to think it through
57:54 and i thought well what's interesting
57:56 about it because there's a unifying
57:58 factor about these worlds
58:00 and the unifying factor is is that the
58:02 people
58:03 in this place these places
58:07 one i feel like they're all the same
58:09 species they are all good
58:10 people there are no jerks in this in
58:13 this
58:14 these other worlds that i see
58:17 and it's not dreamy either it is
58:20 very very real i mean very real and when
58:23 i
58:23 have the the vision
58:28 second one is seeing it second two
58:31 is feeling it feeling the vibe of it
58:36 and second three is understanding that
58:39 this is real it's been there for a
58:41 really long time
58:42 these people are there no matter if i'm
58:44 there or not
58:45 and then i've actually been there and
58:48 enjoyed it one feels like hawaii
58:51 kinda but not beachy but more like the
58:53 in inner
58:54 oahu kind of
58:57 older classic or classical excuse me
59:00 classical
59:02 always a new word huh classic almost 70s
59:05 sort of architecture
59:07 very simple and fun and others are you
59:09 know super futuristic
59:11 cool places but what it started to occur
59:14 to me was
59:16 i know that if i were to be
59:20 actually moved into that any one of
59:23 these other
59:23 universes or whatever you want to call
59:25 them parallel universes
59:27 that i would have to have a quarantined
59:31 decompression out of everything that is
59:34 this world
59:36 because if i brought the acidic nature
59:38 of this
59:39 [ __ ] up place that we're in now into
59:41 that world
59:43 i would be like a virus unless they are
59:46 absolutely capable of
59:48 ignoring me 100
59:51 and it's not that i you know i am
59:53 naturally a good person
59:54 so i feel like that's not the real
59:56 challenge of being a good person the
59:57 other side
59:58 but it would probably be
60:02 swearing and knowing anything about this
60:05 world's
60:06 evil it would have to be something that
60:09 i would have to
60:11 either have condition out of my system
60:14 or something that would have to be
60:15 utterly chemically erased out of my
60:18 brain or mechanically erased i don't
60:19 know how the soul works or whatever this
60:21 thing is
60:23 but to coexist with them i got to be
60:25 them
60:27 so now i think about that opinion of
60:29 that really esoteric strange thing
60:31 and i bring it into this world and i
60:33 think
60:35 what if in addition to simply incubating
60:38 us
60:38 up from birth that
60:42 if man's psyche develops way faster than
60:46 man's genetic instinct and we did create
60:50 this really beautiful
60:51 kind of star trek gene roddenberry world
60:54 that none of us would be qualified to
60:56 be there quickly
61:00 we would have to organically get there
61:04 train ourselves to be worthy of being
61:07 with the people
61:08 that are more sophisticated than us all
61:10 the way to their core
61:14 and instead of making it a class
61:17 you know for those of you who
61:19 self-educate you damn well know
61:21 that when you teach yourself how to do
61:23 something with almost no
61:25 mentorship whatsoever when you learn how
61:28 to do it
61:29 you know it better than the folks that
61:30 went to college
61:33 which is where you get into these
61:34 disputes with people that went to
61:35 college
61:37 because college gives you a false sense
61:39 of security about the information that
61:41 you have
61:42 neil degrasse tyson for instance he
61:45 believes wholeheartedly everything that
61:47 he was ever taught
61:49 he was never taught to think for himself
61:51 as far as i know he has no inventions or
61:53 patents to his name
61:56 all right so i'll take tesla any day
61:57 over neil degrasse tyson
62:00 tesla did a little bit of school but
62:01 most of it was his own work
62:04 standing on the shoulders of giants
62:05 before him but having at least the
62:07 temerity
62:08 to study the the giants before him
62:12 kenneth burke the philosopher same thing
62:15 i think every great philosopher
62:18 used college as merely a stepping stone
62:22 to then develop their own philosophy of
62:24 the human condition
62:27 that's how they become great
62:31 so if we're in this world potentially
62:33 and we are
62:34 self-educating about what is good and
62:36 what is bad by being observant and
62:38 saying man i did that and it really
62:40 screwed me over
62:41 or i felt really bad about it i had a
62:44 massive level of rejection
62:47 or i should say regret excuse me
62:51 massive level of regret and i never want
62:52 that feeling again and so
62:55 you keep they keep resetting the program
62:58 and again in the outside world what if
63:00 it's 10 seconds
63:02 to you know one second per decade and
63:04 you've lived 100 years and 10 seconds
63:07 well it's not a big it's not robbing you
63:11 of your
63:11 of your outside life if it's 10 seconds
63:15 for
63:15 i'm making this up of course but 10
63:17 seconds for 100 years
63:19 so you spend two weeks in this
63:21 conditioning camp to get yourself ready
63:23 to live in one of those more privileged
63:25 more well-balanced super
63:28 high vibration worlds with people with
63:31 great iqs and people that
63:34 um only have ever heard anyone in this
63:37 simulation when they were being
63:38 incubated up to be worthy
63:41 to join man who again has mental
63:44 intellect
63:46 way more sophisticated than their
63:48 genetic programming
63:51 there's some of us that take drugs like
63:54 acid
63:56 acid my first trip which i think was
63:59 about three tabs
64:01 i don't know i mean i we got it from the
64:05 the grateful dead stash but uh
64:08 i had a really good trip because i had
64:09 never had the experience i really
64:11 relaxed my mind but it was mostly
64:12 artistic
64:14 it was amazing a couple little
64:15 hallucinations not much
64:17 on my second trip i took i don't know
64:19 six hits
64:22 no hallucinations whatsoever but man my
64:24 mind was just racing with connections
64:27 and cool stuff and i found myself
64:29 drawing
64:32 okay i gotta find that footage somewhere
64:35 third trip i don't we both don't know
64:38 how much we took
64:40 and i manhandled it again and it was
64:42 even less
64:44 it was wonderful but it was less the
64:46 more you take this stuff the more your
64:48 brain gets used to it and crushes it
64:50 and these are we're talking about um
64:53 my first and second trip was probably
64:55 six months apart from each other
64:58 and then the the next trip was two years
65:00 two or three years later
65:03 so any chemical
65:06 immunity i might have built up would
65:08 have been
65:09 washed away down to zero again
65:13 but this happens to all of us sometimes
65:17 but if you think about let's do a drug
65:20 analysis
65:20 inside of this simulation you might be
65:23 saying well dude if you
65:25 think you're in a computer simulation
65:26 then what the hell is a drug
65:31 it's a program that's what it is
65:35 it's a program what is itunes
65:40 what's itunes to your grandmother and
65:42 what's itunes to you
65:45 maybe itunes to your grandmother means
65:46 frank sinatra
65:49 glenn miller but to you it's
65:52 uh mode selecta it's
65:55 uh tupac it's whatever you like to
65:59 listen to
66:00 you're having a blowout experience you
66:03 are blowing the woofers
66:05 in your computer your grandmother is
66:08 enjoying it in her home stereo system
66:11 simulcast to some apple home unit or
66:14 something and it's just soft and
66:16 wonderful it's classical music that she
66:17 likes to paint to
66:20 but it's still just itunes it's just the
66:23 trumpet
66:24 you're just blowing different notes
66:25 through it
66:28 so a drug inside your program is a
66:30 little subroutine
66:33 that latches on to your interpretive
66:36 circuits
66:37 your interpretive programming modules
66:39 that say
66:41 photons came in your eyes this is what
66:42 you do with those photons sound came in
66:44 your ears this is what you're doing
66:47 again my buddy richard um
66:51 he was playing some beautiful music on
66:53 my first trip i was really just
66:55 laying on the sofa my eyes were closed i
66:57 was having this
66:58 incredible hallucination of like latino
67:00 graffiti
67:01 in my brain it was the coolest thing
67:03 watching these dudes
67:04 paint these cars and uh so cool
67:08 and then um the music slipped
67:12 into like some gangster stuff which i
67:13 didn't know richard even had such a
67:15 thing
67:16 and boy whatever i was i remember i was
67:18 looking at i was looking at this
67:20 weird character in my brain
67:23 kind of look like the weird lady that
67:26 sang for jabba the hutt and return of
67:28 the jedi
67:28 with the lips out on the thing that's
67:30 what it looked like it was kind of a
67:31 little different
67:33 i drew it and
67:36 it turned to like an ostrich skin
67:38 creature and it went
67:39 dark and black and it just looked like
67:42 it was dying like it was turning into
67:44 rotten food
67:46 and then he actually heard him he turns
67:48 it off and he goes whoops
67:49 he puts back on some really cool stuff
67:51 and but it still took my mind a little
67:53 while to shake out the program
67:56 the reason why i like these bizarre
68:02 rabbit holes about where the hell we are
68:05 is that at least one of you listening to
68:08 me
68:09 will have listened intently every word i
68:12 said you totally understood
68:15 and you know at the end of this story
68:18 this isn't really that weird
68:19 it really doesn't conflict with
68:23 anything that you're actually
68:24 experiencing
68:27 and the older that you get and the more
68:29 observant that you get
68:30 aka enlightened
68:33 you realize less and less makes sense
68:38 sometimes it's fun
68:42 i mean like seeing the simpsons predict
68:45 everything
68:46 you're like what you know it's like some
68:49 that's fun though isn't it like
68:51 i don't know how this is happening but
68:52 it's happening and and this dude online
68:54 was telling us all we're watching a
68:56 movie
68:58 and imagine you have administrators that
69:00 are in here going
69:02 let's just take our current situation in
69:04 2021 we have evil
69:08 incarnate pretending to be our leaders
69:11 they all need to be cooked they all need
69:13 to be gallowed
69:15 guillotined they do they all need to be
69:17 just taken away
69:19 if we could just push a button and erase
69:21 him get him out of the program
69:23 we do that so don't worry about any pain
69:25 or suffering just just get him out of
69:27 here right
69:27 turn off their headset and imagine
69:32 and this has happened in video games you
69:35 just get bad
69:35 factions inside games and they start to
69:37 do bad things to other players
69:41 uh in the old shooter games you would
69:43 have um
69:45 you have not only people who hack their
69:47 clients to be able to do stuff to the
69:49 server
69:50 like fire more um
69:54 formidable weapons that they shouldn't
69:55 have access to or weapons that don't
69:57 even exist in the game but sometimes
69:59 they can hack the server to think that
70:01 one shot is one kill
70:03 or they start to do this like perch
70:05 thing where they
70:08 snipe everybody who comes into the game
70:10 it's not illegal
70:12 but they've been playing the game for a
70:13 long time so they have major weaponry
70:15 now rust makes a game out of this
70:16 and you you go in knowing that that's
70:18 what's gonna happen which is nice
70:21 but a lot of games in the 90s the
70:23 creators of the games had to go in and
70:25 say
70:26 you know you can't do this you're
70:29 ruining it for everyone
70:30 else so you've only paid 40 bucks for
70:32 the game but you're running it for
70:33 people that
70:35 total up 400 000 worth of game
70:38 purchasing but
70:39 the reputation is is that you the
70:41 [ __ ]
70:42 are sitting there shooting everybody and
70:44 you make it unfun
70:46 world of warcraft's expansion in 2020 is
70:49 doing the exact same thing
70:51 they made a bunch of crazy top tier one
70:55 percent
70:56 things that you can get out of the game
70:58 but there's limited quantities like just
71:00 a couple of these things they did this
71:01 way back in the day
71:04 and people were pissed they're like that
71:06 one mount goes to one
71:08 guy per server screw this game
71:11 i paid the same amount of money just
71:13 because
71:14 this kid gets there first i mean there's
71:16 always going to be someone who gets it
71:17 first and if there's only one
71:19 well he gets a bonus because he got
71:21 there first randomly
71:22 maybe he had to work hard to get there
71:25 but you're gonna
71:27 maybe you're busy in life right and then
71:29 the nerd at college is like
71:31 you know or some 14 year old kid sitting
71:33 at home not going to school because the
71:35 ignorant uh liberal governors won't
71:38 allow the schools to open up making sure
71:39 everyone's [ __ ]
71:43 they're pissed and they're canceling
71:45 their accounts like crazy right now and
71:46 blizzard's like word
71:47 sjw is you can't tell us we have
71:49 anything wrong we're like good well your
71:51 company won't exist in a couple years
71:54 you're gonna be draining your bank
71:57 doesn't the world
71:58 feel a little juvenile if not massively
72:01 juvenile
72:02 especially today in 2021
72:05 i mean children have
72:09 stolen the car they've stolen the family
72:12 car
72:13 and now they're going down the highway
72:14 the wrong way and we just keep trying to
72:17 say
72:18 you know as they pass us we're like
72:19 wrong way
72:21 they're like we know [ __ ] it man they're
72:24 just
72:24 slaying people because they got some big
72:27 um
72:29 truck that doesn't get damaged by
72:31 hitting other people i don't know
72:34 i don't know about you but i sure hope
72:36 uh
72:37 all of you and me that we graduate
72:42 to a much much more intelligent world
72:46 i mean even just looking back where
72:49 would you insert yourself besides
72:51 somewhere in the 20th century
72:55 and it's only a few countries to live in
72:57 a much more balanced wonderful
72:59 brilliant world where people just want
73:00 to be productive and not screw everybody
73:02 over
73:03 and then when someone starts to screw
73:05 people over
73:07 we kill them it's just as simple you're
73:10 defective
73:10 sorry ping you're out of the game
73:14 your genetics are bad i'm sorry man
73:16 maybe your sister is better but you're a
73:17 piece of [ __ ] see you later man right
73:21 there's so much to be accomplished
73:23 creatively
73:24 intellectually self-awareness-wise
73:28 in a much smarter world cancel
73:31 culture is a bunch of babies
73:34 running around the world trying to keep
73:36 you as stupid as they are
73:39 they don't want you to have anything
73:41 that they don't have
73:43 it's like the little kid at daycare he
73:46 wants to own
73:47 all the toys in daycare and
73:50 even if he's not playing with a toy
73:52 because he says that toy sucks and you
73:53 start having fun with that toy he's
73:54 going to come over and try to take it
73:55 from you
73:56 that's the role we live in super
74:00 sad and you have these pseudo
74:01 intellectuals like some of my family
74:02 members that
74:03 just research nothing know everything
74:05 and and
74:06 they're just a wolf in sheep's clothing
74:11 of sort of a bam bam [ __ ] going around
74:14 destroying the world
74:16 and as long as some other bam bam sooner
74:18 pseudoelectual writes an article in new
74:20 york magazine
74:21 these idiots just completely suck it
74:24 into their system
74:25 but they never ever have the capability
74:27 of standing above the universe and
74:29 saying
74:30 oh wow this is a bad sociological
74:32 experiment where
74:33 that i'm personally contributing to
74:37 they don't want to be wrong and there's
74:39 this crazy disease in the world where
74:41 people want to be
74:42 smart like the guy that posts all day
74:44 long but never
74:45 offers a single intellectual scientific
74:50 theory he just posts things that he
74:53 thinks makes him look smart but to smart
74:56 people he looks like he's removed all
74:58 doubt that
74:59 he will never be in his lifetime
75:01 intelligent
75:03 it's really sad it's really really sad i
75:06 hope these people wake up before they
75:07 die and they can
75:09 enjoy the the huge epiphany and wonder
75:13 of this world
75:14 and actually explore something and and
75:17 you know if you're super polarized where
75:19 you're like if you like flat earth i'm
75:22 going to
75:22 unsubscribe if you like heliocentric
75:25 earth you're gonna unsubscribe it's like
75:27 dude
75:28 why did you ever subscribe i i don't
75:30 think that this is your place
75:32 go on twitter and call everybody an
75:34 idiot
75:35 uh because that's your world that's your
75:37 world
75:38 you are going to be playing this game
75:41 for a
75:42 really long time until you can stop
75:44 doing that
75:45 until you can say hey these are my
75:47 beliefs
75:49 uh you know none of you've been in space
75:52 none of you have been in space how the
75:54 hell do you know what this place is
75:56 i haven't been in space don't try to
75:58 corner me with a
76:00 some sort of polarizing opinion that's
76:02 gonna make you angry
76:04 go take a poop you know
76:09 just strange anyway
76:12 hope you dug this i know some of you
76:14 love these episodes just like i do
76:17 got some other good stuff coming what
76:18 i'm going to start doing by the way is
76:21 i've been going back to season one and
76:22 kind of watching some of the old
76:23 episodes and
76:24 they're great subjects but because the
76:26 production value
76:29 and sort of things i've learned in five
76:31 years i'm going to be reprising
76:34 some of those old episodes and bringing
76:35 them up to date and just going from
76:36 scratch
76:37 so i will be redo redoing my
76:42 cancer treatment episode there's no such
76:45 thing as a cure in this world because
76:47 you can always catch something again
76:49 but be doing that one i'm going to be
76:52 doing probably a certain hadron collider
76:54 one again
76:55 get my notes all updated for where that
76:56 thing is today because every year that
76:58 goes by
76:58 it's more and more intense
77:02 so we should have a good time on that
77:04 note please go to deepthoughtsradio.com
77:07 just bookmark it
77:08 everything's in there i'll give you a
77:09 short bumper today
77:12 for those who contribute on patreon or
77:13 paypal thank you so much
77:16 and in the meantime take care of
77:18 yourself and someone else and i'll see
77:20 you in the next deep dots
77:32 [Music]
