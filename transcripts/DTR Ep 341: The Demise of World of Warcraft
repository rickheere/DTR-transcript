00:00 [Music]
00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen today we're gonna take a break
00:39 on the heavier subjects and we're gonna
00:41 go into something that I actually get
00:43 paid to lecture about which is going to
00:45 be video games and most specifically
00:48 World of Warcraft created by Blizzard
00:53 obviously it's not gonna appeal to a lot
00:54 of you folks so if you just need some
00:56 noise in the background this is probably
00:58 an episode for you for those of you into
01:00 this kind of thing you might find it
01:01 pretty fun before I get into this I want
01:04 to give you a little bit of my
01:05 background so you know you're not just
01:07 listening to someone with opinions you
01:10 are listen to someone with opinions but
01:12 it's fairly qualified opinion I work
01:15 professionally in the video game
01:16 business from 1989 to 2013 I had my own
01:21 company for 10 years roughly 2005-2013
01:27 plus some sort of drifting personal
01:30 projects for two years after that I you
01:34 know my background very quickly you know
01:36 you know you've got guys who listen to
01:37 all the videos you know get your barf
01:40 bags because you're gonna hear a couple
01:41 things twice I worked on my first video
01:45 game in 1981 at the age of 11 with my
01:48 uncle and I was the artist my big my big
01:52 thing when I was a kid was I was a
01:54 pretty good sketch artist an oil painter
01:56 by the age of 9 and so I was able to
02:00 paint album covers and stuff at a really
02:02 young age so by the time I started
02:06 working with my uncle I was converting
02:08 my illustrations into graph paper and
02:11 then turning those into varying layers
02:13 of color on the Texas Instruments 99 for
02:17 a but I have programmed games on the
02:20 Commodore 64 the Apple to the IBM old PC
02:28 the very first green one with no
02:29 graphics cards I had to use all the
02:32 special characters to create a horse
02:35 racing game so I was using like pipes
02:38 and greater than and less than signs to
02:39 create that you know the moving legs of
02:43 a horse and that was based off a drag
02:46 race game I had been on the Apple
02:47 - with full-blown graphics and sound and
02:49 everything as my high school project so
02:52 one was in Pascal on the PC one was in
02:54 the basic on them on the Apple at the
02:58 same time I was at home on a cocoa
03:01 computer at Texas Instruments sorry
03:03 Radio Shack trs-80 cocoa computer
03:07 version 2 and so with that computer I
03:09 created awesome levels of stuff I mean
03:13 from from keyboards to a product call
03:17 FileMaker which is not the same one that
03:19 sold but it did exactly the same thing I
03:22 did paint application with fonts back in
03:26 the mid 80s before any that existed at
03:29 least on that platform of course I had
03:31 to live in 32k of RAM or 64 K of RAM to
03:35 do everything it was crazy and I was
03:36 just a kid really own kid doing this
03:37 stuff so by the time I got to 1989 the
03:41 reason why I got the job out started
03:43 getting laid off was that I had already
03:44 had my digital art portfolio just it was
03:48 gigantic by 89 so I was probably 19
03:51 years old at the time and I was 19 years
03:54 old at the time about to turn 20 later
03:57 that year and I walked in didn't really
04:00 have a color portfolio because none of
04:02 the computers did color except for the
04:03 Amiga and if you had a VGA card for your
04:05 PC which I did not that was the issue
04:09 so fast-forward a little bit I get to
04:12 Electronic Arts as a consultants in 1993
04:16 and found out one of my best friends had
04:19 gone from the venture we shared in 89 to
04:22 92 and he went in there a year later and
04:26 got in to Electronic Arts there's all
04:29 kinds of different positions and now
04:31 he's a big game producer but he and I
04:34 and another dude named Kurt sat down in
04:36 an apartment and we videotaped it
04:38 somewhere I have the videotape and it's
04:40 us sitting down to plan creating the
04:43 first MMO because we realized that the
04:46 engine had come out where you could
04:47 actually infinitely scroll a world and
04:50 use fog as a shroud for the loading
04:52 sequence out there and so we held a few
04:55 sessions on how to do this because Kurt
04:57 was a absolute genius
04:59 and Billy's a great producer role player
05:02 and I do my engineering side and my
05:05 artistic side on my game design side
05:07 because in the 80s you had to design
05:09 your game on paper and then write all
05:12 the script do all the art and do all
05:14 your programming you were one dude that
05:15 did it all right so I start getting into
05:20 the bowels of Electronic Arts I was
05:22 doing consulting for the QA department
05:24 writing a database for them at the first
05:26 time and here I come in with all this
05:29 experience and I'm doing some weird
05:30 thing off to the side but you do
05:32 everything in EA when you work there you
05:35 pitch in on everything constantly but
05:39 1994 EA purchased I don't know if this
05:43 is the actual year that they purchased
05:45 them but EA eventually purchased origin
05:47 which origin now runs EA and so they had
05:51 had this game called Ultima and it's
05:56 really funny my girlfriend's brother
05:58 played every single Ultima when I was in
06:01 the Midwest and so I got a chance to see
06:02 this game but I never played it and so
06:06 by the time we got this news that origin
06:08 was creating the first MMO based on
06:11 origin are based on Ultima so it was
06:13 Ultima Online and so it took four years
06:16 to get this game out the door in 1998
06:18 and so we were the first MMO on planet
06:21 earth and of course the copycats came in
06:23 really really quickly god bless him
06:25 EverQuest was the next one that really
06:27 blew the doors off because it was 3d
06:29 brilliant game engine you know a lot of
06:34 friends that lost their life's
06:36 programming they're playing that game
06:37 and I just mean they played it so much
06:39 they didn't have a social life but then
06:41 Ultima Online was extremely popular
06:44 obviously it was the only game in town
06:46 for a long time until EverQuest came
06:47 around and so then when the origin
06:49 people saw EverQuest going to 3d they're
06:51 like what we need to do this and so they
06:54 started a secret project called Ultima
06:56 Online 2 or as we called it internally
06:59 uo2
07:00 and you can still see a trailer of this
07:02 demo trailer of this online on YouTube
07:05 all it's really low res but after a year
07:08 and a half of making that product and
07:10 having no perspective of what it takes
07:13 to make up
07:13 like that Electronic Arts went to origin
07:16 and said look man you're spending a ton
07:18 of money when are you gonna have this
07:19 thing done and they said well probably
07:22 another year and a half and they said
07:24 well we don't trust you
07:26 so we're canceling the project know if
07:29 any of you had seen uo2
07:31 it was essentially world of warcraft way
07:35 before world of warcraft at least four
07:37 years before world of warcraft came out
07:39 now as rumor has it obviously the group
07:43 imploded who was creating that and some
07:47 folks went to Blizzard as I understand
07:49 it and got their artwork in there maybe
07:51 some of their engineering because there
07:54 there were essentially characters who
07:55 looked exactly the same between the two
07:57 games - just a few little copyright
07:59 changes right especially the big fat
08:02 guys with the big hatchets and the
08:05 chains there was one of those dudes in
08:06 uo2 but the idea that a character would
08:09 dance silly just as something to do was
08:13 in uo2
08:13 in 1999 the beta or the Delta or
08:16 whatever it was and then everyone was
08:18 asking why would you want to do that and
08:20 then when I got inside the world of
08:22 warcraft franchise it was like well of
08:23 course this is a funny place right but
08:26 you owe olds while online the ultimate
08:28 franchise wasn't a big jokey platform so
08:31 then we're doing these creative things
08:32 that were brilliant no one was getting
08:34 it okay so here's your setup so I'm
08:38 coming to you as a as a software
08:41 engineer I'm coming to you as a video
08:43 game artist and I'm coming to you as a
08:45 video game designer I have taught
08:47 countless classes in colleges all up and
08:49 down California from Berkeley to Chapman
08:53 University to Nome in school film art
08:58 and game and just a lot of lot of
09:01 different lectures and little halls here
09:03 and there the UCI the University as they
09:07 started their game University so this is
09:10 something I've been paid to talk about
09:12 in general so as we go into this world
09:14 of warcraft analysis which i think is
09:17 utterly fascinating for me it's a it's a
09:20 it's a once-in-a-lifetime game that i
09:25 think recently last year
09:27 in 2018 they made too many mistakes the
09:32 very avoidable and having at least half
09:37 a dozen close friends in Blizzard by
09:40 2008 and then looking at where it is
09:43 today they're great people but I think
09:46 they've replaced it with too many folks
09:47 that I guess just don't get what the
09:52 customer wants at this point it's really
09:53 sad so blizzards going through a lot of
09:56 changes right now in 2019 Activision's
09:58 going through a bunch of changes and I
10:00 don't know how you solve this problem
10:03 because you can't fire your way
10:05 necessarily into success right you've
10:07 got to get the old-school folks in there
10:09 that understand gaming and have them
10:11 work on your title and figure out first
10:15 what's wrong
10:16 where do you make mistakes where is the
10:18 fatigue and then go in a different
10:20 direction right and at the end I'm going
10:23 to share my expansion that I designed
10:25 for world of warcraft so well button
10:27 that up news at 11:00 there you go so
10:30 vanilla world of warcraft comes out in I
10:32 believe 2004 and yet because the guy was
10:37 playing it and one of the places I was
10:39 consulting some programming I saw it it
10:42 was beautiful and I was like I have to
10:44 stay away from this product right now
10:46 because it will suck me in it is
10:48 everything I ever wanted in an MMO and
10:52 so I didn't get into the game until
10:54 December of 2005 vanilla of course I
10:58 joined this game and for those of you
11:00 who don't know anything about Wilda
11:01 Warcraft I doubt you would continue
11:03 watching but if you do get through this
11:04 let me throw you two minutes Warcraft
11:07 was a game created in the 90s which was
11:09 a funny sort of medieval
11:12 resource-management game so you build
11:15 little buildings you tell people to go
11:16 out and grab the resources by shutting
11:18 down chopping down a tree or mining gold
11:20 or whatever you needed to do to build
11:22 your buildings and then you would have
11:24 the story line battles between the the
11:28 scenarios that they program so you would
11:30 create like a a faction next door that
11:31 will come and attack you and you see you
11:33 go through these phases and you got
11:35 these levels and you level up and they
11:37 created several versions of the title in
11:38 2d and then they eventually went to
11:41 three
11:41 I think a little too quick and the
11:43 computers were too slow to really show
11:46 this off and it's its glory they're
11:47 actually porting it right now to the
11:50 modern day computers because one of the
11:52 founders said you know I'm gonna play
11:53 the old game I don't think anyone's
11:55 interested in playing the old game
11:57 besides a few old farts that won't make
11:59 up the will make up the expense to
12:04 create the game in the profit margin
12:05 unfortunately so I think going backwards
12:07 is just a fun thing to do to kind of say
12:10 hey you know Corvette builds another 64
12:13 stingray just cuz it's really cool and
12:15 they'll sell every model but they won't
12:17 make that many so that's not a probably
12:19 the way it goes I could be wrong so this
12:23 thing goes on a hiatus for I don't know
12:24 I guess it would be I think about 96 97
12:28 people were pretty much done with the
12:30 game I mean for those of very loyal
12:32 lists you're gonna say I'm full of crap
12:33 and good for you that you love the game
12:35 that much but by 2004 the franchise was
12:40 largely mothballed and so when this
12:42 thing comes out you have a revolution in
12:47 mmo's they learned every lesson from
12:50 EverQuest every lesson from Ultima
12:52 Online and anything else that was out
12:54 there such when this came out it was
12:56 balanced it was beautiful and it ran
12:58 really well on any computer that they
13:00 said it was compatible with considering
13:02 this was 3d and it had a lot of assets
13:05 in there it was amazing now I don't have
13:08 the lineage in the change history from
13:11 2004 which I think was like March or
13:14 something up to December 2005 I did play
13:19 it I just watched people play it but it
13:22 was utterly gorgeous they did interviews
13:24 introduced some extra classes but the
13:26 way the game works is that you pick a
13:29 race and so you'd be human or orch or
13:31 troll or whatever and you Torin which is
13:35 a cowl race and then you pick your class
13:38 so you're a hunter you're a warrior
13:40 hunter didn't release with the original
13:42 game it came later you're a rogue which
13:44 is sort of like a thief you know you're
13:46 backstabber and that kind of stuff but
13:49 you venture out on your own doing a
13:50 single-player thing and eventually you
13:52 start grouping with other people to
13:53 share the
13:54 Quest's if you gotta kill 20 antelope
13:57 and grab their hooves to bring it to
13:58 some guy in town you can get together
14:00 and you'll share every other spoil we'll
14:02 go to the next guy in that rotation and
14:04 it was it was beautiful and then they
14:08 had the the dungeons which were very
14:11 tough thing to figure out with the
14:13 initial ultima online dungeons were not
14:16 phased which means there was a boss in a
14:19 cave and everybody would go in there at
14:21 the same exact time and kill the boss
14:22 and everyone sitting around waiting for
14:24 the boss to respawn and they'd kill it
14:26 and then you know kill it in two seconds
14:28 and a bunch of people didn't get to
14:29 touch the guy so the loot is hard to get
14:32 managing you know your turn was
14:35 impossible and so they eventually
14:37 figured out phasing which is you go into
14:39 a dungeon and you get your own room with
14:41 your guys there's the boss only your
14:44 guys have access to it and infinitely in
14:46 the background a bunch of other people
14:48 going into the same exact room and
14:49 they're getting their own little
14:50 instance of the dungeon that was the new
14:53 technology that was figured out I don't
14:57 know if EverQuest figured that out I
14:59 never saw my buddy do a dungeon in
15:00 EverQuest but will the Warcraft had it
15:03 figured out when I got there in December
15:07 the game allowed you to get to level 60
15:09 and then that was it they're gonna need
15:11 to expand the game to get you any higher
15:14 and so I would go into the main town and
15:16 almost everyone in the whole game was at
15:18 60 just sitting around waiting and all
15:21 they did was they went into the dungeons
15:23 because the dungeons had the challenge
15:25 for them it was a boss that was so
15:27 difficult it took 40 people to kill and
15:29 then the loot was very sparse so if you
15:32 had a bunch of fancy loot on you know
15:35 this dude had been in and out of a
15:36 dungeon 200 times at least now the
15:40 object of the game no one wants to admit
15:43 it but it's actually a dull dress-up
15:44 game that's what it is
15:46 so you're trying to create a doll which
15:50 is your avatar inside the game and you
15:52 are dressing it up you're getting better
15:55 weapons better armor you're leveling
15:57 your skillset with those objects and so
16:01 that's the end game you want a better
16:02 ride because you can buy these mounts
16:04 that you would first the first amounts
16:07 we're just all land
16:08 mounts and then as they expanded up the
16:10 game they came out with flying mounts
16:11 which is a big deal so fast forward you
16:16 have several expansions from from 2005
16:21 all the way up to present-day 2018 each
16:24 expansion has always been met with a lot
16:27 of criticism here and there but in the
16:30 end most the time these expansions are
16:35 successful in fact I'm gonna go through
16:39 the expansions and why I think they were
16:40 successful and why they weren't
16:41 successful and the thing that the thing
16:48 that what happened to me is there would
16:49 be an expansion that I thought would
16:50 totally suck and it ends up being my
16:52 favorite expansion and the other
16:54 expansions that look amazing and they
16:55 end up being bore fests both Isa with
16:58 each expansion what ends up happening is
17:00 for those of you haven't played the game
17:02 you get in the in vanilla game you had
17:05 two continents on a planet and what they
17:07 ended up doing with one expansion is
17:09 creating a whole new planet with its own
17:10 big giant continent separate places you
17:13 can go to that all look different behave
17:15 different then they realized well we
17:17 don't really have to do that we can
17:18 actually create new continents on this
17:20 previous map and so most of the
17:22 expansions have all been inside this
17:24 original map now the cool thing about
17:28 World of Warcraft versus all other games
17:31 that aren't like World of Warcraft so
17:33 will so for other MMOs they might be in
17:35 this category but as a parent I I knew
17:40 that I was going to be playing lots of
17:41 games because of my career and so my
17:44 daughter was gonna see me playing games
17:45 it'd be hard for me not to tell her are
17:47 hard to tell her that she could play a
17:49 game but I didn't want her to see things
17:52 that were I did want to get her into a
17:55 mind-numbing game that was going to rot
17:58 her brain right and so I let her play
18:00 games that were educational for the
18:03 first several years of her life when she
18:05 crossed ten years old I'd let her start
18:07 playing The Sims which allowed her to
18:08 figure out how life works in a very big
18:11 way it was very powerful for her I've
18:13 talked about it several times on the
18:15 show but when she got into Sims 2 and
18:16 they could make babies my kid learned
18:18 that you need an income and a stable
18:20 family before you start having children
18:21 because
18:22 demand a lot of resources money and time
18:25 and she learned that literally told me
18:27 after playing the hardest level first
18:29 she just couldn't beat this
18:31 trailer-trash level and she goes man you
18:33 just got to be married you got to have a
18:34 job before you have kids it's like good
18:37 for you but she ended up playing World
18:39 of Warcraft and absolutely devoured the
18:43 game and what I loved about it was it
18:45 had reading comprehension if the reader
18:48 quests and you have to translate that
18:50 into action and a lot of these quests
18:53 were written in riddles and so you had
18:55 to have a little bit of that IQ stuff
18:58 that knowledge-based I should say
19:00 intelligent intelligence based thinking
19:03 to get the thing done plus the best
19:05 thing of all was that you had to be
19:07 tenacious about grinding to get a quest
19:11 finished into work really really art
19:13 over and over and over so and that's
19:15 what life does right that's what a job
19:16 is that's what your education is so my
19:18 kid got this huge reinforcement of that
19:21 algorithm right when she needed it so
19:25 right off the bat you know you have
19:28 vanilla while vanilla while can't
19:32 receive any other score but a 10 out of
19:35 10 which or 5 stars out of 5 stars you
19:39 can't give it anything less than that
19:40 because they hit it out of the park as
19:44 is evident by their user base that blew
19:46 up the profit margins that blew up it
19:49 was amazing now could they keep all the
19:51 people that got to 60 completely happy
19:53 no but I mean what can you do you got to
19:56 create an expansion that takes a little
19:58 while if you never create an expansion
20:00 before then you're trying to iron out
20:02 the rules of how to create an expansion
20:05 now I have a Fry's Electronics down the
20:09 street in Fountain Valley California and
20:11 one night I wanted to go buy something
20:14 at Fry's and so I grabbed my girlfriend
20:17 I'm like would you go with me
20:18 I'm just like sure that's a real
20:21 girlfriend let me tell you well we get
20:23 to the parking lot and there's a line
20:24 around the whole store and I'm like what
20:26 the hell's going on here and they said
20:28 the new expansion for World of
20:30 Warcraft's coming out we're all waiting
20:32 to get it and all the employees are
20:33 inside fries they're gonna sign our box
20:35 as we go through this is uh Burning
20:38 Crusade otherwise known as BC so I'm
20:42 like do you mind honey if we stand in
20:44 line wasn't terribly long you know at
20:45 first and she's like no okay I'll do it
20:47 so we stood in line I bought this box
20:49 got it signed by everybody it was really
20:52 cool man
20:53 I still own that box by the way brought
20:56 it home plugged it in install it and I
21:00 have to say pound-for-pound beauty for
21:04 beauty game design for game design
21:06 Burning Crusade for me is the ultimate
21:08 expansion now you might think well
21:12 you're an old fart that's why you think
21:13 that yeah maybe
21:15 what I loved about well the Warcraft is
21:18 gonna Burning Crusade excuse me as
21:21 opposed these other ones which we're
21:22 going to get into was that they had game
21:25 playing at the forefront of the design
21:29 what does that mean when you were in
21:32 Burning Crusade you have a brand new
21:35 world with a bunch of different regions
21:36 so imagine like a continent and it's all
21:38 balkanized into these different regions
21:40 and these regions were distinct and I
21:43 mean super distinct if you walk to the
21:46 edge of one of these realms you look
21:48 down at the soil and it was orange you
21:51 could walk to the next area and it might
21:55 be purple on the ground or green like
21:58 like a weird green like a weird
22:00 possessed green or there could be lush
22:03 almost Hawaii looking green right
22:05 nagrand or it could be just absolutely
22:08 dry desert with these crazy spikes
22:11 coming out of the earth it was it was
22:14 designed to create an environment and
22:16 when you walked into that world they lit
22:18 the sky differently so all the ambient
22:20 light bouncing off everything that you
22:22 brought gained this mood right
22:25 I believe the lands called Zanger Marsh
22:27 something like that the purple place
22:30 with all of the the mushrooms the
22:35 soundtrack for this game was truly
22:38 unreal I mean it was beautiful when the
22:43 game designers of world of warcraft said
22:45 we heard the soundtrack for the first
22:47 time we weep
22:48 yeah because it was so beautiful and so
22:50 amazing it's it's literally John
22:52 Williams level stuff in my opinion and
22:56 into the soundtracks were appropriate to
22:58 the area that you were in what's nice
23:01 about the world being arbitrary in all
23:04 the different areas being very very
23:06 distinct almost designed in a bubble
23:09 where they weren't asking questions to
23:10 the cubes next to them what do you make
23:12 in your world look like and you know
23:14 instead of saying oh it's this way this
23:15 way this way we're gonna make sure our
23:16 worlds blend together
23:18 I'm sure the statement was something
23:20 like we're not telling you you do your
23:23 world we do our world it's a competition
23:25 all right I mean it may never happen
23:27 that way but when I played the game it
23:30 was like having a bunch of different
23:32 worlds to play in and that was brilliant
23:36 and that prioritized the game the gamer
23:39 and not some other agenda it also freed
23:43 up the artists to do whatever the hell
23:45 they wanted to in their world they don't
23:47 have to worry about what's going on in
23:48 the rest of the continent and this is
23:50 something that was lost in the very nice
23:52 expansion which I think was a big big
23:55 mistake the next expansion was the Wrath
23:59 of the Lich King and the I believe they
24:02 won an Emmy or something for the
24:06 cutscene on this on this game with Lich
24:09 King is fighting a dragon and he's on
24:12 he's in the icer it's his buddy's
24:13 resurrecting his dragon or whatever and
24:15 it's the ice cracking and it's just the
24:16 most beautiful intro scene all the
24:19 cutscenes of everything in Blizzard are
24:21 utterly breathtaking and they pay a lot
24:24 of money to their employees to get it
24:25 right or at least that was the case
24:27 right the Lich King created a new
24:31 continent called northren just north of
24:34 the two main continents and they're in
24:36 the initial initial of vanilla Wow but
24:39 they did something that spread this big
24:43 brush of boredom over the whole place
24:46 it's a northern continent so it's kind
24:49 of like Antarctica but it's in the north
24:51 and it's a mountainous terrain all this
24:54 other stuff and there's some some lush
24:55 areas in it but what they did at least
24:58 from the outside looking in was they
25:02 they said well you know Burning Crusade
25:03 was not logical in terms of a
25:07 geographical geological excuse me
25:11 Sensibility and it was like you can't
25:13 have orange soil turn into you know
25:17 purple soil it's not just a line in the
25:19 ground that happens right you you
25:21 gradually have to change land and it's
25:24 all based on temperature and storms and
25:27 where the coast is and all this other
25:29 [ __ ] that we don't care about right
25:30 so the world itself was primarily
25:34 covered in snow and the theme of the
25:37 world was a dark evil Lich King which is
25:41 sort of like isn't that the archetype of
25:43 most stories bad guy lives in a weird
25:45 world well there with Burning Crusade
25:50 you had these enchanted places nagaram
25:53 which is absolutely gorgeous there's a
25:55 super high level place to go that you
25:56 wouldn't go right away
25:57 Zanger marsh which is this beautiful
26:00 again purplish kind of world they also
26:02 had their dark areas as well but you
26:05 could you can kind of be in that dark
26:07 area and kick a bunch of dudes butts and
26:10 they could go over to that ground I
26:11 should just hang out there and fish you
26:13 know it was like just a beautiful Hawaii
26:15 looking joint and just chill out you
26:17 know I'm doing something else but
26:18 listening to my little Bob in the water
26:20 make a splash and I hit the key to fish
26:23 and then I catch 500 fish and run off
26:25 and do something else with Northrend
26:28 you're sitting in this world and Lich
26:29 King I should say you're just in a
26:33 dreary kind of place the entire time you
26:37 can't really find anything that's there
26:38 was a there was like a meteorite crater
26:41 place that had sort of the lush tropical
26:43 world but it was boring we got through
26:49 it the quests were very clever the
26:51 quests are always the part that usually
26:53 wins you over when it comes to the
26:55 expansion you may not like the world but
26:57 they start playing the quest were gone
26:58 that was clever that was cool
27:00 I like the way you changed that you
27:02 changed this but we noticed something as
27:05 well which is that you got a company
27:09 making at one point over a billion
27:12 dollars a year in product sales and
27:15 monthly subscriptions and by the time
27:18 Lich King came out we noticed they were
27:21 repurposing a ton of the assets that
27:23 were in vanilla or Burning Crusade they
27:26 take spiders and just change him a
27:28 little bit they changed the the texture
27:31 a little bit a few more bumps maybe an
27:32 eyeball that didn't exist before the
27:34 ogres kept showing up and showing up
27:37 just with different paint on them
27:38 different capabilities stronger it was
27:40 the same old [ __ ] you might you know cop
27:44 this lion which like when they were too
27:46 poor to create new and immuno new
27:49 animals [ __ ] all right
27:51 this place is making money hand over
27:54 fist they could have subbed out anything
27:57 their artists were off the chain right
27:58 the amount of art that was created for
28:01 each one of the expansions that never
28:02 turned into actual beast was was I don't
28:06 know hundred to one so that in itself
28:09 started looking really strange why why
28:11 are you repurposing things when you got
28:13 enough money to make it original hmm
28:15 don't know if you had a rig that you
28:18 already animated we can install that rig
28:21 into something completely different they
28:24 never got really creative with it like a
28:26 two-headed monster with like one breathe
28:28 fire one breeze you know ice just a
28:32 basic creative thing there right but now
28:35 the interesting thing about World of
28:36 Warcraft because I had actually popped
28:38 out and started my own game company in
28:40 2005 and we were doing mostly casual
28:42 titles for online web browsing stuff
28:44 right having lived 15 years and the
28:49 other stuff we always used World of
28:52 Warcraft as the conversation centerpiece
28:56 the cornerstone for all game design no
28:58 matter how casual the game was we'd
29:00 always be in a conversation somewhere go
29:01 well you know well the World Cup does
29:03 that this is sort of what we're doing
29:04 from that theme and of course well the
29:06 Warcraft built off themes and other
29:08 games but they really notched took it up
29:11 a notch I will definitely say now even
29:14 though I might have a criticism about a
29:16 particular expansion let me tell you
29:18 every single expansion until this recent
29:21 one has enchanting world's great
29:24 dungeons great places places that when
29:27 they load and you see
29:28 you feel just warm and fuzzy I typically
29:31 would not play the game much in summer
29:33 and OD in it on winter or in winter and
29:38 I was anticipating that happening this
29:40 year but it ain't happened in this year
29:43 now the third expansion is I think most
29:48 often referred to as one of the worst
29:50 expansions up until this recent one
29:52 which is Cataclysm Cataclysm had a
29:54 cutscene that was the trailer that got
29:56 us all to buy the game which was a
29:58 mechanical dragon and created by dwarfs
30:02 who in lore of all or you know dwarfs
30:06 create the weapons for the gods see I
30:08 mean they create Thor's hammer I mean
30:09 their that's who they that's their just
30:12 master craftsman right elves are bad
30:14 craftsmen but their more ornate
30:17 self-serving typical creative worlds
30:22 where they build stuff for themselves
30:23 they don't build anything for anybody
30:24 else and it's all it's all dainty right
30:29 the Cataclysm started to show the
30:32 inability in my opinion to create a sort
30:37 of a unified story that would really tie
30:41 an expansion completely together it
30:43 really started looking to me like they
30:44 just had a bunch of random ideas and
30:46 sort of stuffed it all in just to a
30:48 particular box it was the very first
30:50 time that the forum's started filling up
30:52 with people saying I'm out of this game
30:54 I was in a guild at one point where I
30:58 had dudes that were top top of
31:01 everything at every single you know
31:04 pseudo armor they could possibly have
31:06 like arenas we're starting around that
31:08 time and they were just winning all
31:10 kinds of stuff but they still bailed
31:11 they were like this is this is crap I'm
31:13 not playing this title now some of the
31:16 the the dungeon quests involve fighting
31:19 this dragon and it was so monumentally
31:23 huge like a real dragon in dungeons of
31:27 dragons which would be bigger than
31:28 Godzilla it you only could fight little
31:32 parts of the beast at once so you
31:33 crawled up its back and then you ended
31:35 up fighting it
31:37 where was half inside this Canyon you
31:40 know reaching out to get you and so
31:42 wasn't like you know one dude striking
31:44 it with the sword it's dead like Dragon
31:46 Slayer
31:46 the Cataclysm ndu introduced water which
31:51 was very very interesting it suffered
31:55 from water because it sort of slowed
31:59 down your moving and so they gave you a
32:00 little seahorse that you could use to
32:02 get around pretty quickly in the title
32:03 because he realized there was a bit of a
32:05 flaw it was kind of neat to be in water
32:07 you never had any problem breathing in
32:10 the water because they gave you I forgot
32:11 what it was they gave you some ability
32:13 that just removed the water problems but
32:14 then you jump in the water someplace
32:16 else and you drown if you didn't know
32:17 what the hell you were doing right but
32:20 it was enchanting up to a point but
32:22 again it was again largely constrained
32:25 by an underwater geological engineer
32:28 that came in there and said well you
32:30 know is this kind of coral exists in
32:32 this so they're policing the artwork
32:34 based on reality which is what what
32:36 everyone is trying to escape right then
32:40 there was this two-year pause while
32:44 we're all digesting Cataclysm again a
32:46 lot of people like my guild my guild
32:48 just blew up after cattle ISM release
32:50 cuz all the heads left then there was
32:54 mists of pandaria it looked like Kung Fu
32:57 Panda initially when I saw the trailer
33:00 of it I was so heartbroken that they
33:04 were going to make this Panda race it
33:06 was gonna go for both Alliance and the
33:08 Horde for those of you don't know what
33:10 that means inside this world we have two
33:14 giant factions we have the more human
33:17 faction which is all kind of warm fuzzy
33:20 you get to play humans basically and
33:22 then you have the Horde side which
33:24 didn't have a human-like character until
33:26 they came out with the blood elves which
33:28 are basically humans with big giant ears
33:29 and who are awesome and so I'm seeing
33:36 this mr. Pender II and you know I like
33:38 to kung fu panda movies but I thought
33:39 man what are we doing with this where's
33:41 the the gritty lore of World of Warcraft
33:45 and so I was very pessimistic but I
33:48 bought it because you know you just got
33:50 it
33:51 the time it wasn't bad I was kind of
33:54 frustrated with the first Q quest a few
33:56 first few quests easy for me to say and
33:58 then I fell in love with it
34:00 miss depend area turned out to be one of
34:03 my favorite expansions of all time and
34:05 the interesting thing was Metzen was
34:08 interviewed just after the expansion
34:10 released I believe at a Blizzcon and
34:13 they were sort of passing up some of the
34:17 criticism and giving him a chance to
34:18 kind of you know bat it down which he
34:20 did a great job but the most brilliant
34:24 thing Metzen said I think I got this
34:26 right was I'm paraphrasing him of course
34:28 but he said something to the effect of I
34:30 wanted to create a race that made you
34:34 think about war because you don't have
34:37 to be angry and killing something all
34:39 the time and the pandas are based off of
34:43 obviously Japanese / Asian you know
34:47 face-saving honor system right it's
34:50 almost like a samurai type lifestyle and
34:55 it was they were largely alcohol makers
34:59 and but they had this just beautiful
35:02 manicured world now again they they went
35:06 for this Jeolla geological accurate
35:09 island which again gets boring after a
35:13 while but at least was Pleasant it was a
35:16 nice uplifting bright green world and so
35:19 wherever you were you were pretty much
35:20 okay yes there was snow and that kind of
35:22 stuff cuz they basically figured out
35:24 snow looks great not really realizing
35:27 that it might get boring after a while
35:30 you know now I should take a quick step
35:35 to describe the fact that they
35:38 eventually introduced flying into the
35:39 game and flying was a big problem
35:43 not because of the expansions but
35:45 because of the original vanilla game
35:46 there's a lot of construction that's
35:49 invisible inside these levels at a
35:52 higher elevation so there would be
35:54 literally walls that had you know
35:58 collision detectors on they say you're
36:00 bumping into wall you're bumping into a
36:01 wall if you could get in the air so they
36:04 couldn't just open up
36:04 flying right away because they had to go
36:06 back and redo the the world and when
36:10 Cataclysm came out they destroyed and
36:12 changed a lot of the vanilla world such
36:15 that places that you used to be all the
36:17 time were gone which i think was
36:19 actually a fairly cool idea I think that
36:24 it did sort of break some of the hearts
36:27 of folks that were going to you know
36:30 want to go back and go through their
36:32 levels at the old at the old style so
36:36 they ended up phasing the old with the
36:38 new which was kind of cool but it was
36:41 sort of it was actually a great story
36:43 situation because you ended up mourning
36:45 the loss of these great traditional
36:46 places that you were able to go to in
36:49 the game but they had to totally redo a
36:51 lot of the artwork on the background to
36:53 allow flying to occur at least in
36:56 vanilla and I believe there was the way
36:59 they said it was Orgrimmar on the north
37:02 side and sorry I always play hoard you'd
37:05 run into a wall if you were able to fly
37:07 so they fixed that and got flying going
37:08 it was actually something you could
37:10 purchase pretty quickly in the game as
37:13 long as you leveled up but then the as
37:16 it was rumored internally now there's
37:19 two reasons why they do this but they
37:20 end up making flying a super pain in the
37:23 ass to get in the new region so you can
37:24 fly in all the previous regions you
37:26 would achieve flying capability but for
37:28 some reason you couldn't fly in the new
37:30 world which makes no sense but that's
37:31 fine it's a game but the artists were
37:35 getting upset that if you flew you
37:37 wouldn't see their artwork I don't know
37:39 if that's true I could as an artist I
37:41 think I could get behind that a little
37:43 bit and understand that but they also
37:45 had simplicity in questing if you could
37:48 fly because you could fly into an area
37:50 hit hit hit hit kill some folks on the
37:52 edge and then fly out and go to another
37:54 weak spot and hit hit it and you know
37:56 you still have to do the fight so it's
37:58 not like you're suddenly levelling
38:00 through the game extra extra fast a
38:02 little bit faster I'm sure for
38:04 SuperDuper badass players and these guys
38:06 hit maximum level right every expansion
38:10 gives you ten more levels and so you
38:13 could get a kid within 24 hours hitting
38:17 the top
38:18 ten levels because they've been
38:19 preparing and they played the beta of
38:21 the game they knew where to go so
38:23 interesting so after Miss depend area we
38:26 have the warlords of draenor and this is
38:31 there was a something that medicine said
38:35 in his interview about Mississip end
38:37 area that he dropped that immediately
38:39 had me concerned and he said oh man
38:42 we've got the next five expansions
38:44 figured out maybe even said ten and he
38:48 goes we're really gonna dig into the
38:49 lore of World of Warcraft like oh
38:52 suddenly you're gonna dig into the lore
38:54 cuz it's been a pretty lower base game
38:56 right again Burning Crusade did a
38:59 beautiful job creating its proprietary
39:01 storylines which were fantastic you
39:04 always want to be expanding your lore in
39:06 my opinion not going inward to try to
39:10 get at some Freudian realization of your
39:12 previous lore and the lore that well at
39:16 Blizzard is gigantic for Warcraft
39:18 they've got to two to four people
39:20 dedicated to writing lower all day long
39:23 you know and it's very important that
39:25 you can do that that you can afford to
39:27 build up your your world but they you
39:31 know they had this problem where again
39:33 they were repurposing tons of old assets
39:36 again mister Pandaria was no different
39:38 you had the Panda race and they're in
39:39 their world but you didn't have the the
39:44 real freshness of all the different
39:46 creatures and things I mean there's
39:48 always a couple new creatures but I mean
39:49 come on you have two years to do this
39:52 you know it's been six months designing
39:55 new creatures they don't have to have
39:56 any sensibility and then you plug them
39:58 into the Lord and give them a backstory
40:00 and and fill them up right and I've done
40:02 this several times Electronic Arts but
40:06 warlords of draenor got you up to level
40:08 100 and you just for me personally it
40:13 was it was everything that had bored me
40:17 to death condensed into one expansion
40:20 however the the quest designers were
40:23 able to keep me going and were able to
40:26 keep you excited and playing the title
40:29 so the sixth expansion moving quickly to
40:33 these because they they don't have a lot
40:37 to describe in my opinion Legion
40:39 introduced the broken Isles which was a
40:41 new continent near Azeroth and you have
40:46 more of this introspective lore more
40:49 reason to get bored with the game
40:53 because you're going back into you you
40:56 are getting a chance to see some of the
40:58 characters that you've never seen before
41:00 but you you don't get the the sort of
41:05 hey if if Walt Disney was still alive
41:08 for instance and he were to say there's
41:10 a brand new world I'm making you would
41:14 know that whatever he is he is creating
41:16 will be a new world it will be like
41:18 tomorrow land will be like frontier land
41:20 or adventure land it'll be a new world
41:22 and well the Warcraft goes it's a new
41:25 park and if we you know it's when it
41:28 opens its frontier land 2.0 you know and
41:31 you're kinda like man they I don't
41:33 dislike frontier land there's no
41:34 criticism of that place but I've already
41:36 been there and for you to just diversion
41:37 it up not enough guys not enough right
41:41 but Legion introduced some really
41:46 amazing cities that and a new leveling
41:51 system where you got a weapon that would
41:57 allow you to expand a big talent tree
42:00 and and one of the things that end up
42:01 happening with the game was that again
42:04 the game is so expansive this episode
42:05 can only touch on the basics Russia said
42:07 at the beginning but there in vanilla
42:10 while you had a talent tree which
42:13 between Velo vanilla while on Burning
42:15 Crusade just kept getting more and more
42:17 complicated to figure out how do you get
42:19 your character configured so you can
42:22 actually beat this particular boss and
42:24 so you would save different
42:27 configurations for different dungeons
42:29 and that just got to be crazy if any of
42:30 you see the old brilliant clip called
42:33 Leroy Jenkins you'll know the the
42:38 preceding minutes up to the point where
42:40 Leroy Jenkins goes and does his thing
42:42 and I'll explain that
42:42 one second for those of you totally
42:43 don't know they were looking at
42:46 calculators that had been generated
42:48 outside of the game to figure out how
42:51 successful they would be going into the
42:53 next room of a dungeon
42:54 that's how complicated the game was and
42:56 once you make something that complicated
42:58 sometimes it plays really well to your
43:01 core audience and then other times it's
43:03 like jeez this is this is a little too
43:06 much people can't just fall into the
43:08 game and make it work right the other
43:11 problem they ran into before I explained
43:13 written Leroy Jenkins is that if you're
43:15 selling an expansion that takes you from
43:17 level 90 to level 100 you have to have a
43:19 bunch of people at level 92 want to buy
43:22 the expansion so each time the expansion
43:25 came out they what they call nerfed they
43:28 made it easier and easier to get to 90
43:30 and then it started to get harder when
43:32 you leveled in vanilla while it was
43:35 torturous to get through the last ten
43:38 levels I mean you were playing every
43:40 single day for hours and hours and hours
43:43 and you just yell like a 10% bump on
43:45 your level whereas after five expansions
43:49 you could get to 90 in jeez like a week
43:54 if you're a casual player it was cool
43:56 and what's beautiful is you're giving
43:58 them money for an experience they
44:01 shouldn't impose on you too much
44:04 restraint for you to have the experience
44:05 as quickly as you want to have it now
44:07 they're always worried about fatigue and
44:08 we're gonna get into that once we get
44:10 through these expanses really quickly
44:11 the légion ended up being pretty damn
44:14 cool and the previous expansion we were
44:17 given something called a garrison which
44:19 was a little city that you got to make
44:21 by yourself and build these little
44:23 buildings and slots and level them up
44:25 separately and you got all kinds of neat
44:26 amenities if you were a tailor it would
44:29 make you tailor things and give you
44:30 supplies for it yeah so that was
44:34 brilliant but then they abandon it when
44:35 they went to Legion you had no reason to
44:38 go back to that place and so by ignoring
44:41 a previous creation it was sort of like
44:44 that Apple Computer thing they make
44:46 QuickTime it's really cool and then they
44:48 just leave it and they just abandon the
44:51 format altogether and then old pro res
44:52 comes out and then all of a sudden
44:53 they're back into it again but
44:56 time you abandoned the technology so do
44:58 your users and so when you want them to
44:59 come back you're the boy that called
45:01 wolf right well this is where they make
45:04 the big ass mistake they made Legion
45:07 created this beautiful system where
45:09 you've got this very special weapon that
45:12 then you gathered experience and these
45:15 little items to level the weapon
45:18 essentially infinitely but it got double
45:20 the difficulty every single time that
45:22 you leveled it but you earned it you
45:24 know and you could login every single
45:26 day and do your daily quests which gave
45:28 you more credit towards upgrading your
45:31 weapon and it was a reason to come back
45:33 into the game they learn something from
45:35 like games like clash of clans which is
45:37 you must log in every day repair your
45:39 base take all your money do upgrades
45:41 maybe shield up for a week so you can
45:43 save more money it's it's a reason to
45:45 get back in the game so we all fell in
45:48 love with this thing
45:49 this artifact points that turn into this
45:52 extra leveling system plus they had over
45:55 they'd completely simplified the talent
45:57 tree which was really cool now some
46:00 people hate the fact that they made it
46:02 easier I think that you have to look at
46:05 how meticulously difficult it was to get
46:10 into a dungeon in the Leroy Jenkins days
46:12 so Leroy Jenkins real quick there was a
46:14 level in dam at the the name of the
46:19 dungeon escapes me at the moment but
46:21 there was a room full of all these
46:24 dragon eggs and if you walk by a dragon
46:26 it gave a pop and it would pop all the
46:27 other dragon eggs about ten of them and
46:29 they're really hard to knock down these
46:31 drag Ling's little tiny dragons flying
46:34 around right and so they knew that you
46:36 had to go in and you hit one of the eggs
46:38 and you pull everybody back into the
46:40 previous room you pull the dragon drag
46:41 Ling's in you not come all down and hit
46:43 the next stack the next stack until you
46:45 wipeout must be like ten stacks to these
46:47 things and then you can start finding
46:49 the boss at the end of the room and at
46:51 you know back in vanilla Wow it was just
46:54 a deadly ass room to touch everybody had
46:57 to be standing in the right place no one
46:59 could touch the extra eggs otherwise
47:01 you'd have 20 of these dragons and you'd
47:03 have a wipe so all these dudes are
47:06 standing in a room and they're doing
47:08 this calculator and
47:10 they're boring half the players and one
47:11 of the guys character names was Leroy
47:14 Jenkins I think that was his name of the
47:15 character and so he gets bored at one
47:18 point and they go and he there say okay
47:21 guys you think you you know might be
47:22 ready for this yeah okay and then this
47:24 guy just screams Leroy Jenkins and he
47:27 just runs in the room hits all the eggs
47:29 and there they're staying in the
47:32 previous room going did he just go in
47:34 there oh my god and they all weren't in
47:35 there and they try to fight and
47:36 everybody wipes and it was just they
47:39 call him a they call him a an idiot or
47:42 something in his last words were at
47:44 least I got chicken and he ended up
47:46 being so famous for that I got recorded
47:48 and I got put on the web it became so
47:50 famous that kept dividing that player to
47:52 the bliz cons to scream it into a
47:54 microphone was really cute so then
47:58 battle for Azeroth more of the same
48:01 shits right now I will tell you this I
48:06 played this game I bought its I bought
48:07 the deluxe son version of the game I
48:11 have played it for probably a couple
48:14 hours and I was so utterly furious about
48:19 what I found when I logged in I haven't
48:22 been able to play it again but they've
48:23 made in my opinion at least on the Horde
48:25 side a game a super uber mistake
48:32 you logged into this game and that
48:35 artifact point system that you had been
48:37 building for your special sword it was
48:42 gone you push your your artifact lookup
48:46 table because you're you be log in every
48:48 single day like I was very close to
48:50 taking up a couple of my weapons and two
48:52 of my characters I got like nine maxed
48:54 out characters and it gives me this
48:58 grayed out version of my table and says
49:01 all of your artifact points have been
49:03 consumed and welcome to the expansion
49:07 and you're like oh it'd be like logging
49:11 in and my garrison is gone and they say
49:13 well you don't need this anymore we
49:15 decided oh okay right so the first big
49:19 mistake they made as a game designer is
49:21 they didn't make the
49:23 artifacts sacrificing ritual that
49:26 happened while you were installing the
49:28 the new expansion they didn't embed that
49:31 in a story they didn't make it part of
49:33 the transition from one to the other to
49:36 help you rationalize losing all of your
49:38 work it's still a bad idea but they
49:44 could have they could have transitioned
49:45 it into something lighter another system
49:48 of getting artifact points and some
49:50 other way for another weapon and other
49:51 thing whatever in the new world right so
49:55 and I have characters that are very very
49:57 powerful and Legion I saw I expected to
50:02 go in and have no problem kicking ass
50:03 and taking names in the next level and
50:05 again if I had nerd it out completely
50:07 played the beta right on every single
50:09 blog on this yeah I'd probably be able
50:11 to actually do that
50:13 but I don't know that much time in my
50:15 life I mean it's because I'm an older
50:16 guy
50:16 I think the demographic is older guys at
50:21 this point so you're gonna have to serve
50:22 your core customers right I mean just
50:25 think about if I play with the guy 2005
50:27 that was 25 years old
50:29 you know the dudes in his late 30s at
50:32 this point come on but then I start
50:36 playing the core quests of battle for
50:38 Azeroth and I find myself on this troll
50:43 pyramid it's beautiful arts great right
50:47 but the pyramid is so goddamn large that
50:52 if you just try to jump off one of the
50:54 the steps you're gonna die
50:57 where I haven't got a lot of health man
50:58 you're just gonna die and so you get the
51:01 quest at the top of this pyramid and you
51:03 got to spend about five minutes get down
51:05 the pyramid to do your quest at the
51:08 bottom now maybe there's a teleport I
51:09 don't know about but I Jesus I could not
51:11 find this thing to save my soul I
51:13 couldn't believe they put me in the
51:16 middle of this frustration dream and
51:20 called it a game right so then I'm like
51:23 you know it's not uncommon to be a
51:25 grumpy old man when a new expansion
51:27 comes out it's just not but I go to the
51:30 forums I'm like am I crazy
51:32 is this game just been gutted you know
51:35 sure enough the forum is packed with an
51:37 unprecedented amount of criticism about
51:39 this game I go online all the reviews
51:42 are just tearing this game a new one
51:44 I had just dragged a friend back into
51:47 the game I had her pay money to change
51:49 servers I got her into my guilt my guild
51:53 has a page on Facebook
51:55 no one ever posts on it anymore I mean
51:58 no one said we're all leaving this game
52:01 it just went silent we're talking I
52:04 don't know 750 people on this guild
52:07 I mean individual characters we all have
52:09 our own you know tunes our extra
52:11 characters so I've got 8 out of my 9
52:14 characters or in that guilt so you know
52:16 it's the same person playing several
52:17 these characters but anyway it just all
52:19 went away unbelievable right so let's
52:25 rewind why is this happening why is ever
52:29 expansion getting more and more boring
52:31 and why isn't Blizzard capable of
52:34 listening to their customer base right
52:37 well something happened in 2008 that's
52:41 very very important and I don't know
52:42 exactly the years because it's all an
52:44 internal secret project but they started
52:47 a project which I believe secret title
52:50 was Titan and they poured hundreds of
52:54 millions of dollars into this and as I
52:56 understand it it was very much like what
52:59 destiny turned out which is obviously a
53:00 Bungie game but of some futuristic MMO
53:04 and they built it out of their very best
53:08 employees the best Starcraft people the
53:12 best World of Warcraft people and see
53:15 you had a ton of people moving into this
53:17 new group to create this new big game
53:19 the number I heard at the end was eight
53:22 hundred and thirty million dollars was
53:24 invest in this game now I also look at
53:27 websites telling me that my buddies are
53:28 worth 20 million dollars they barely
53:31 have a coin to banging together so those
53:34 numbers could be greatly exaggerated but
53:36 Blizzard cancelled Titan I don't know if
53:39 they cancelled Titan because destiny
53:40 came out or why they cancelled it I have
53:44 close friends that worked on the title
53:46 and they stay pretty tight-lipped you
53:49 after they left blizzard but they said
53:52 yeah yeah it's sort of like destiny but
53:54 you know there's a little something else
53:56 now here's your problem
53:58 you got the cream of the crop and your
54:00 company that know how to get expansions
54:02 done moving into this title around 2008
54:05 so everything after 2008 all those other
54:08 expansions started sucking I think
54:11 because they lost their core DNA then
54:14 they all quit because where they're
54:16 gonna go their seats have been filled
54:18 can't just go back to the old project
54:19 someone's already doing your job now
54:23 what's interesting about the individuals
54:24 who quit because thing went off to
54:26 become mega stars right some of these
54:29 dudes went off to Eyal em some guys went
54:31 to Wetty some guys are free consultants
54:33 for everybody some people went to
54:35 Microsoft
54:36 some guys started their own company some
54:37 guys bought you know operating shares in
54:41 no man art school I mean it's like these
54:43 dudes are brilliant people all by
54:45 themselves so you could just push them
54:47 into the world they'll always succeed
54:49 right so instead of figuring out a way
54:51 to recapture all those people and say
54:54 well we're not losing you you know
54:56 you're gonna get your paycheck we'll
54:58 figure out a way to keep you happy let's
54:59 get in the room together and talk about
55:01 it maybe they tried this I don't know
55:03 now they give you incentive packages to
55:07 leave the company but at the time of
55:10 this Titan expansion they tripled their
55:13 employee numbers and they told the
55:16 employees because I was privy to one of
55:19 the meetings that they were having I
55:20 didn't attend it but my friend told me
55:23 right when it happened he goes this is
55:24 really scary and I said what's going on
55:26 he goes well they're tripling our
55:28 employee base and they're telling us
55:30 that they're tripling now but they're
55:31 gonna have to reduce later because
55:33 they're gonna find a bunch of people
55:34 they don't have skillsets and to my
55:36 knowledge the reduction never occurred
55:38 which I don't know if reduction would
55:40 have helped but that's a problem I think
55:44 the problem is lower fatigue I think the
55:47 problem is pulling in geologists to
55:50 drive the art department stop making
55:52 worlds that are so freakin accurate to
55:55 our world we want to escape this place
55:57 don't recreate earth in your game and
56:01 then just give it a different name
56:02 and say oh this is totally this and that
56:05 right we want to see [ __ ] like Zanger
56:07 marche places that are utterly
56:09 phenomenally conceptually brilliant but
56:12 physically impossible that's what we
56:14 want right that's what I want about you
56:17 guys so I was working at my game company
56:19 I think it's about 2009 or so I started
56:23 seeing these expansions coming out and
56:24 getting really concerned I thought well
56:26 Blizzard is right down the street I got
56:28 friends who worked there let me see if I
56:30 can get into the company just as a
56:32 consultant you know just a pitch pitch
56:34 an idea see or they go with it you know
56:37 of course there's a lot of vested biases
56:39 and everybody who works at a company
56:41 right my idea I've been waiting 10 years
56:43 from my idea and sometimes those are
56:45 good and sometimes those horrific ideas
56:47 if someone's having a really good an
56:49 idea Blizzard right now they are not
56:51 being heard let's just put it that way
56:54 again they may have some amazing game
56:57 it's two days from from this episode
56:59 releasing and I look like a big horse's
57:01 ass but right now
57:02 world of warcraft is dying dying at a
57:08 rapid pace it has a virus of trivial
57:12 repeat patterns right so let's talk
57:15 about fatigue for one second I think
57:18 they have lore fatigue I think they have
57:20 artwork fatigue
57:21 you definitely have fatigue of all the
57:22 characters you're fighting because
57:24 they're all the same people with
57:25 different skins on them and all that
57:27 stuff it's boring
57:29 ok no more spiders no more orgs are
57:32 these I think they're orgs right or not
57:35 Oh curse they did a great job upgrading
57:38 all the character art so they look more
57:40 photo real they still have buildings
57:42 with about 20 polygons hey man I know it
57:46 was really cool in 2004 to honor to 1994
57:49 design principles but it ain't gonna fly
57:51 anymore you're gonna have to upgrade all
57:53 the Poly's you're gonna have to make
57:54 this thing look more realistic and I'm a
57:57 proponent against realism being the
57:59 reason why game is better but you're way
58:02 past the mark right
58:03 another big criticism from the internal
58:05 employees and this is a 2014 comment
58:09 from one of my friends who left he said
58:12 you know we would be shown the next
58:14 version of the engine
58:15 by the engine programmers at a big
58:18 presentation internally and we come away
58:19 going what the hell is going on with
58:21 these people our engine looks
58:23 ridiculously old and it just just at
58:27 face value you have no you have no sort
58:30 of impulse by when you see the engine
58:32 play you have to be into the story and
58:35 already know why it looks primitive you
58:37 know so I started thinking so I'm gonna
58:39 get into my little expansion here it was
58:41 something I was hiding forever because I
58:43 was trying to get it in but it's there's
58:45 no hope at this point so here you go man
58:49 so I started tiptoeing around this whole
58:52 thing thinking well I can't design a
58:55 expansion in the future very easily
58:58 because it's it's all predetermined
59:00 right they've now marched through two or
59:02 three expansions with just plain
59:03 old-fashioned vanilla lore and again
59:06 that shit's getting old
59:08 we're tired of seeing all that old crap
59:09 kind of they almost have bosses saying
59:11 the exact same phrases to you while
59:13 you're finding them right so I thought
59:16 okay let's do a prequel let's do a
59:19 prequel because there's a lot of time
59:21 travel in the game so there's no problem
59:22 with flashing backwards to do something
59:26 but they have all these different types
59:28 of magic in the game if arcane magic and
59:31 natural magic and holy magic and a bunch
59:33 of other stuff right but no real story
59:36 there there is I did talk to a guy he
59:39 was SuperDuper into the lore about all
59:40 the books and he was definitely kidding
59:42 me hip to some of the back story they've
59:44 been written and I guess if you pay
59:46 attention to everything everyone says
59:48 and read every note and book that you
59:50 find in the game the stuff starts to
59:52 come out but I mean playing the game for
59:54 13 years and not really getting the
59:56 answer that I was looking for I thought
59:58 this was a pretty good sweet spot so I
60:01 created a an expansion called wizards
60:03 and demons and the two new classes were
60:06 going to be Wizards and demons because
60:08 you can never really be a demon you can
60:10 be arcane and have a little demon off to
60:12 the side but you can't play that race
60:14 wizards being sort of your vanilla mage
60:19 sort of an ambidextrous all-purpose
60:23 magic user and so what I did was create
60:28 a backstory where
60:29 some wizards the first incarnation of
60:31 magic users discovered various forces in
60:35 the universe that were capable of being
60:38 sort of the alchemy of magic right and
60:40 they realized very quickly that it was
60:42 super duper risky to play with this
60:45 stuff on their homeworld and so what
60:47 they did was they took a continent and
60:49 lifted it into space so they could
60:52 practice up in their little Flat Earth
60:54 disk literally and develop schools of
60:59 thought on how to do each individual
61:01 magic so they divided up the continent
61:03 into the each individual magic except
61:06 they have one challenge arcane magic was
61:09 this very dark mysterious stuff it
61:12 always ended up being sort of a problem
61:14 the more you played with it and so in
61:16 order to this is the backstory in order
61:19 to get some arcane magic onto this
61:21 continent they built a keep which is
61:24 basically a big giant fortress to keep
61:27 something inside right it's a great
61:29 movie called the key from the 80s are
61:30 gonna see it and they summoned the
61:32 diamond into the keep and they summoned
61:35 him directly into an apparatus that held
61:38 his throat held his arms held his body
61:40 and they wrapped a big giant chain
61:42 around him and in sort of the cartoon
61:45 fashion that is world of warcraft the
61:47 chain went completely around the
61:49 continent
61:49 he was basically chained to the
61:51 continent and they built the keep such
61:54 that his exuding arcane energy would
61:57 leak out of the keep under the grounds
61:59 and they put some magic barriers to keep
62:02 it from leaking all over the place they
62:04 allowed a body of water to get tainted
62:06 with this stuff and they watched how it
62:08 tainted the land right so imagine a
62:10 round disc one side is one-third of the
62:14 whole place is arcane and the other
62:16 two-thirds or all the other magics
62:17 divided up now there's individual cities
62:20 that they brought with them that were
62:22 already indigenous to the continent and
62:24 then they built schools individual
62:26 schools for the individual arts are the
62:28 magics right but what happens is is that
62:31 the the Wizards there's about twelve of
62:35 them one of them is sort of the lead
62:37 he's the lead guy he's our big hero and
62:40 the other eleven are just good
62:42 boys young good ol Wizards trying to
62:44 work out their various skill sets but
62:47 they end up all playing with the arcane
62:49 power a little too much and they don't
62:51 realize it but they're all getting
62:52 possessed and they're getting possessed
62:55 by the demon who says you know what you
62:56 need to do you need to get me out of
62:58 this place take me to the center of the
63:00 continent which has this sort of
63:03 worshipping area sort of a Stonehenge a
63:07 kind of place and you need to perform
63:10 this ritual it's really important and so
63:14 they they get possessed they push him
63:16 out this is all the front story they get
63:18 him in the middle of this continent they
63:20 start casting this spell and that's when
63:26 the good guy wakes up and notices what's
63:29 going on everybody's gone and they're
63:30 all doing this ritual and he's seeing it
63:32 from a few miles away because it's a big
63:34 cauldron of purple magic going up and he
63:38 realizes oh [ __ ] this is about to bring
63:40 down potentially everything from that
63:42 world into this world so he cast this
63:44 massive spell which breaks it but it
63:48 also causes a gigantic dispersion of
63:50 energy it explodes in their face all the
63:52 dudes down in the center are killed the
63:55 demon is not coal backwards towards the
63:58 keep the chain breaks the good guys
64:02 blasted backwards they're both knocked
64:03 cold the good guy wakes up first drags
64:06 the demon inside the keep kind of makes
64:08 really quick you know fixes to the key
64:10 it's not gonna hold forever and then he
64:13 and his almost dying breath sends a
64:18 message back to Azeroth to get us to
64:24 come and help out when the continent
64:26 breaks because it breaks as a result of
64:29 this huge pop from this magic going
64:31 wrong
64:32 it breaks the continent into sort of two
64:34 to semi yin-yang shapes right one's all
64:39 arcane one's all good but the guy casts
64:42 a spell
64:43 to blanket the entire place in two
64:47 phases so there's two little islands in
64:50 opposite areas one's going to be the the
64:52 demon starting area and one's the wizard
64:54 starting area
64:55 you show up as whatever the hell you are
64:57 but you can also start in this two
64:59 different regions and build that way but
65:02 what happens is you show up and the
65:03 place is pretty much barren except for
65:05 the even the arcane places a little bit
65:07 barren there's not much to do there's no
65:08 places that exist and you show up and
65:11 there's this big stone there with a big
65:14 combination on it now the first one was
65:16 really simple you just turn it and do a
65:18 couple little things pick up a rock here
65:19 put it in there sort of like the the
65:22 formation in Indiana Jones Temple of
65:25 Doom where he's putting those rocks in
65:26 there and turning it on right but it
65:28 unravels this thing my big my big
65:32 feature upgrade was that as soon as this
65:34 thing turns a beast from that new region
65:37 that's about to unlock runs up to you
65:39 and screams at you and you get a title
65:41 plate and you get kind of a preview of
65:43 what's gonna be in that new area they
65:45 actually did that and I believe Legion
65:48 right it's funny how those things happen
65:50 right but immediately a water drains out
65:53 of this lake and there's a whole world
65:55 in there a whole bunch of people
65:56 different race you've never seen before
65:58 but the cool thing about this expansion
66:00 is that you don't get to see places
66:02 until they're there so they don't have
66:04 to gank your flight they can let you fly
66:06 wherever you want they design it to be
66:08 flying friendly on the first day right
66:11 you unlock the different regions by
66:13 getting the combination pieces to put
66:15 into these stones and you end up
66:18 unlocking the whole thing now of course
66:21 your dungeons are all the schools all
66:24 the different buildings that you don't
66:26 quite understand that we're being built
66:28 to harness a particular type of magic
66:30 but the keep is going to be the big
66:32 final game final expansion content and
66:35 the keep is sort of like a labyrinth so
66:39 as you're fighting in a dungeon that
66:40 keep is changing shapes and so you're
66:42 gonna have to be in the right place at
66:44 the right time when one of these
66:45 cantilevers it might be a floor piece
66:47 moves up and hovers over the Beast and
66:51 so you're gonna have to be in the right
66:53 place to do the combination so adding an
66:55 organic element to the actual dungeons
66:58 themselves another big upgrade is that
67:01 if you are saying natural magic you can
67:04 actually walk into a lake when you're
67:05 injured but your hands in Lake hit a
67:07 combination
67:08 and it actually sucks life out of the
67:12 lake and repairs you
67:13 same thing with going up to a tree so
67:16 you can get a bunch of different
67:17 augmentations if your holy various holy
67:20 structures can actually heal you so it's
67:23 a little tiny thing doesn't make a big
67:25 deal not a lot of injury issues anymore
67:27 in the game because they give you plenty
67:29 of plenty of power to heal yourself
67:30 properly but for some of those classes
67:32 that struggle might be a valuable little
67:34 addition to the game another thing I put
67:38 in there was that mounts start to have
67:40 some distinction between them right so
67:43 let's say that you're in the previous
67:44 expansions and you have an area that has
67:46 a bunch of tigers but you have a tiger
67:48 mount well if you're willing to get on
67:50 your tiger mounts it's so ferocious and
67:53 formidable and bigger than all the other
67:55 least normal Tigers there's maybe an
67:58 elite class tiger that might not fall
68:00 for this but as you can ride through
68:01 those areas without having intimate Accu
68:03 and so you get to the next one and it's
68:05 a bunch of dinosaurs so you jump on your
68:07 dinosaur and you like do those and they
68:09 think you're one of them or at least
68:10 they're freaked out enough by your
68:12 amount they won't mess with it therefore
68:14 they won't mess with you so that's the
68:17 basics of the expansion I drew quite a
68:19 bit of artwork to figure out how this
68:20 place should look started drawing some
68:23 of the potential characters that would
68:25 be in the game but again Blizzard has
68:28 all the power to turn that basic concept
68:30 into a game but think about it
68:32 you get away from the lore of World of
68:35 Warcraft and its pure form all those
68:37 names you already know all the
68:38 association's you need to know and
68:40 you're doing a back story it feeds in
68:42 perfectly with the game and if there
68:44 have been lower written about various
68:46 magics you can either put them in the
68:47 mezzanine like the clone wars between
68:50 this beginning and where we ended up
68:52 starting vanilla well or you can sew it
68:53 into the game itself but the cool thing
68:57 is that this world is all magical
68:58 everything is magical so the geography
69:01 problem that we are not geography
69:03 geology problem that we have we're
69:05 making everything makes sense that not
69:07 to make sense anymore because each
69:09 balkanize region of this continent has
69:11 its own magic it has its own owners and
69:14 so if you walked in and the world went
69:16 from purple to green makes complete
69:18 sense
69:19 right the demon race I wanted to make
69:24 very similar to Ralph Bakshi's demons
69:27 from the movie Wizards so they're kind
69:30 of goofy and strange and they're kind of
69:32 funny it brings back to calm the comedic
69:35 element to a particular character so as
69:37 you see your character just walking it's
69:39 kind of funny you know and you could
69:41 probably if they were to upgrade the
69:43 engine they could allow you to choose
69:45 sort of how do you want your demon to
69:47 look do you want them to have horns do
69:48 you want to have a big body thin body
69:49 and you can make all kinds of different
69:51 little demons it's all part of the same
69:53 rigging you know maybe again you make
69:54 certain movements a little bit different
69:56 the idols and the walks and maybe how
69:58 they strike you could create a few
70:00 weapons there's tons of demons in the
70:02 game right but we don't want those
70:04 demons from banila being in the [ __ ]
70:06 expansion right the wizards they're very
70:10 robed individuals they have the hoods as
70:15 opposed to having your head free it's
70:16 part of the part of the look and feel
70:18 this thing and so I think that you could
70:21 create a lot of enchanting elements with
70:23 them plus introduce a bunch of new
70:24 magical capabilities that have never
70:27 been in the game look at every game
70:29 that's ever been made with magic every
70:31 movie that's ever been made with magic
70:32 just lifts ideas right rebrand them
70:35 restructure them put them in the game so
70:39 world of warcraft I hope I hope you
70:43 survive I hope you re patch yourself I
70:47 definitely will never ever buy world of
70:50 warcraft again without hearing rave
70:52 reviews from close friends of mine
70:54 so they got 79 bucks out of me and
70:57 probably two months worth of
70:59 subscriptions trying to figure this game
71:01 out and they they burned that bridge
71:04 they really burned the [ __ ] out of that
71:06 bridge so again I've never I've never
71:10 played a game that long in my life I may
71:13 never again maybe I'm just an old guy I
71:15 don't know but I still love games I
71:17 played fallout now for three years I'm
71:21 still finding new rooms I've never been
71:23 in played the crap out of this game so
71:25 there are ways of still capturing a
71:28 user's attention
71:30 so that's a little weird episode for you
71:33 if you have been to deep thoughts radio
71:34 please go it's a place where you can
71:36 change formats from audio to video video
71:38 to audio there's a lakh Facebook group
71:40 and a patreon page
71:41 take care of yourself in someone else
71:43 and I'll see in the next deep thoughts
71:44 over now
71:46 [Music]
71:54 you
