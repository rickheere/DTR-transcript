00:00 [Music]
00:34 hello and welcome back to deep thoughts
00:37 in this sort of Sunday afternoon it's
00:40 about 62 degrees today we're gonna talk
00:44 about legislated beliefs nobody think
00:49 about this one for a long time if you
00:51 consider yourself awake which I hope you
00:53 do you know that freedom is sort of on
00:58 your mind that's that's part of what
01:00 waking up is all about it's not the only
01:02 theme of waking up but it's it's sort of
01:05 the end goal at the end of the day
01:06 trying to preserve any mechanism we have
01:10 achieved as human beings to be free and
01:14 we perceive freedom you know as all
01:18 kinds of different things but most often
01:21 we just perceive it as the ability to
01:23 move around to do what we want with our
01:26 careers to marry who we want to marry
01:28 and have as many kids as we like go to
01:32 school for what we want to go to school
01:34 for get the job that we want to get and
01:37 just generally be left alone right
01:39 that's sort of the basic thing that you
01:42 understand in your 20s thankfully the
01:46 kids in their 20s today understand I'll
01:48 hell of a lot more than we did in our
01:49 twenties in certain areas for sure but
01:55 the freedom that you really need is
01:56 inside your head the ability to think
02:00 and not be persecuted to not feel some
02:03 rush of guilt into your guts because
02:06 someone has told you that you're
02:07 thinking wrong but it gets harder and
02:11 harder these days
02:14 doesn't it now if you take the world
02:18 population and you call that a hundred
02:21 percent there is this teeny tiny virus
02:27 this sort of scummy little residue
02:31 that's trying to grow on the surface of
02:33 the planet of people that are trying to
02:36 control the whole planet right if it
02:42 were a human body if you take the
02:43 population of the world and transpose it
02:46 onto every cell in the human body the
02:50 percentage of people trying to control
02:52 the whole body would probably be the
02:54 tiniest little speck on your skin a
02:57 little imperfection and pigment
02:59 placement if you're black could be a
03:01 little white one if you're white be a
03:02 little black would you know just a teeny
03:05 tiniest group of people get off on the
03:09 notion of saying oh my god we are so
03:11 insignificant we really aren't all that
03:14 but we control the world but over the
03:18 course of least the Hodge podgy history
03:23 that we think we understand about
03:25 humanity and again no one really knows
03:28 what happened really I mean I think
03:30 maybe in some Vatican vaults you might
03:33 have a lot more clarity in some
03:35 Rothschild Museum there might be some
03:38 clarity but overall we so BS ourselves
03:45 about our own pasts half the time
03:48 especially the more that you have an ego
03:50 you start to embellish your past you
03:53 didn't really do that but you kind of
03:55 said you did you know I've got probably
03:59 out of my friends that worked in film
04:02 and television that kind of thing you
04:03 know most of them are pretty honest some
04:09 are brutally honest some are so humble
04:12 they don't give themselves any credit
04:14 for the stuff that they did and I like
04:16 them for the things that they did you
04:17 know it's really weird but some you
04:22 never quite became what they wanted to
04:24 become and so they embellish 24/7
04:27 they'll say they designed something and
04:29 you go online because the Internet's a
04:30 nice defense mechanism against Liars
04:32 these days especially when you're
04:33 claiming Hollywood credits that you have
04:36 no business claiming and you look down
04:39 the IMDB or a fan site that's actually
04:42 dissected every single molecule of
04:45 contribution on a particular film cult
04:47 film TV series and you'll find out the
04:49 person claiming to have done these
04:51 outrageous things has done those or
04:53 outrageous things but they can convince
04:56 enough people in Hollywood that they
04:58 have and they get alkyl aids for it well
05:01 that is psychosis that little insecurity
05:04 of thought and process travels all the
05:08 way up to those that run the planet
05:11 we're always talking about the hubris of
05:13 man right the arrogance of men and we
05:16 wonder why they think they're winning
05:17 when they're losing
05:19 I mean we're happy that they think
05:21 they're winning when they're losing it's
05:23 a great thing because they get what we
05:26 call delusional right and sometimes we
05:29 say okay well it's okay if they're
05:31 delusional or not or at least we're
05:34 trying not to be we're really trying to
05:37 discern information true/false or maybe
05:40 but the problem is is if we allow that
05:42 delusional group of people to remain
05:47 delusional and they again they sort of
05:50 control your environment that control
05:52 your laws that control your taxes and
05:55 what you can and can't do they control
05:58 perhaps the medical regimen of your
06:01 child I mean you can run from them
06:04 successful even but then you're not able
06:07 to settle down in your destiny because
06:09 you're always running away from their
06:11 their hand of control right this episode
06:15 is going to be about areas where they
06:18 have legislated their beliefs
06:24 and some of its illegal not to believe
06:28 what they tell you to believe and I'm
06:32 gonna tell you right now before we get
06:34 into specifics it is my opinion that
06:37 anything that they're forcing you to
06:38 believe in a law is absolutely
06:41 unequivocally untrue because you don't
06:46 have to force people to believe in the
06:47 truth truth predicts the future truth
06:50 doesn't need laws truth just needs
06:53 evidence proof and when they're biessing
06:58 you there is no proof and so they come
07:02 up with sort of institutions to police
07:06 the notion that they're not lying but
07:08 there's usually also a profit margin
07:10 behind it what they want you to believe
07:12 there's control behind what they want
07:15 you to believe now there is a book 1984
07:23 we use it to refer to the Orwellian
07:26 thinking these subjects have been
07:30 dissected on a level that's unbelievable
07:32 with in 1984 the book a more I would say
07:39 a more romantic version of what can
07:42 happen if you don't if you if you lose
07:44 control in this manner where you let
07:46 people police what you think would be a
07:48 brave new world by Huxley it is again a
07:52 little less in-your-face but it shows
07:54 you the absurdity absurdity of where
07:56 they want to take us and Huxley
07:58 supposedly confided in his closest
08:01 friends that he wrote the book based on
08:03 having looked inside the plans of the
08:06 delusional ruling class and it is
08:10 amazing how that is exactly what has
08:13 happened in a lot of cases a lot of
08:16 drugs being given to children breaking
08:21 down the moral fiber of our humanity
08:26 Twilight Zone the series developed and
08:30 created by Rod Serling also has several
08:32 episodes that get into this but probably
08:34 the most poignant one is one with
08:36 burgess Meredith called the obsolete man
08:39 the state had figured out what was true
08:41 and what wasn't true what was valuable
08:44 and what wasn't valuable and burgess
08:46 meredith being a librarian was being
08:49 essentially put down because he became
08:52 obsolete because he refused to continue
08:55 producing things that the system said
08:58 was valuable I guess he was a carpenter
08:59 on the side a little poetic nature to
09:05 Christ right but now every lie has an
09:08 agenda right and what you will find in
09:11 this world today is the number one
09:15 agenda that is crafting tremendous lies
09:21 its population control these planes that
09:25 leave trails in the sky
09:27 population control genetically modified
09:31 foods created by a company that has
09:34 created only poisons in this world
09:37 that's depopulation vaccinations
09:41 inoculations population control gender
09:46 uncertainty population control promoting
09:53 obesity and fast food population control
09:59 but there's a subplot to population
10:02 control that's not really discussed on
10:05 points so allow me to a large extent
10:09 money makes the world go round even for
10:11 those ruling class scumbags up there
10:13 the secondary game that they play aside
10:16 from rushing you into being as sick as
10:18 possible and rushing your children into
10:21 being mentally ill with ADHD autism
10:25 which is not autism it's brain damage to
10:28 varying degrees
10:29 remember flu shots still have mercury in
10:32 them the preservative thimerosal but all
10:35 shots have aluminum in them
10:37 horrible for your brain but their
10:41 secondary goal is to turn you into an
10:42 ATM fetch me a $20 bill boy they want
10:50 you to go out and work and slave and to
10:53 get sick doing so such that when you pay
10:56 for your pharmaceuticals when you pay
10:59 your 9/11 tax it goes straight to them
11:04 what don't they own right we used to be
11:09 self-employed almost all of us 150 years
11:11 ago no matter where you lived on this
11:13 planet the very few people work for a
11:15 corporation you might work for the
11:17 government when you wanted to get shoes
11:20 you bought it from a shoemaker
11:21 when you wanted to buy bread you went
11:23 down to the local bakery owned and run
11:25 by that family by that guy by that girl
11:28 now it has to have a brand on it right
11:31 for it to be good used to buy cloth and
11:35 make her own clothing and if we did make
11:38 it ourselves we farmed it out to someone
11:40 who owned their own business who would
11:42 craft that dress that suit so they're
11:46 willing to allow you to live for a
11:48 little while to fetch them money because
11:53 in order for them to toast that they
11:55 control people they have to have
11:58 something that they can claim their
11:59 control they killed off the entire world
12:03 what would they possibly brag about
12:05 they'd go off and get lost in some
12:08 mansion somewhere plagued by the
12:11 occurrence of a mirror now I create an
12:14 episode in season one called thought
12:16 police and it's very similar to this
12:18 except this has a slightly different
12:20 spin to it this is going to focus on
12:24 things that are being shoved down our
12:25 throat in terms of beliefs that are
12:28 [ __ ] they're trying to legislate
12:31 into the minds of everyone right imagine
12:36 that I want to go after a kind of a
12:39 weird one first year imagine you had two
12:43 incredibly racist people don't worry
12:46 about what race it is but one on the
12:48 left and one on the right and whatever
12:50 there are different races
12:51 and they just they have been an inbred
12:53 by their parents by their neighborhood
12:55 to despise each other now of course it
12:59 is all cultural right maybe one person
13:02 eats a certain food that the other
13:04 person thinks is gross some person
13:05 thinks the way they smack their mouth
13:07 when they eat is just sickening but
13:09 that's their cultural way to say I
13:11 really like your food it's going back
13:13 and forth and it turns into a color
13:15 identification mechanism in the brain
13:17 right
13:18 it's a pattern recognition thing oh I
13:20 saw someone with that color of skin and
13:22 that will hair and that is the person
13:24 that look up in the database
13:26 I hate why because mommy and daddy and
13:30 Grandma grandpa and everyone else around
13:32 me hates him too now what if we just
13:34 said there's a law that says you have to
13:37 you have to like the other person now we
13:41 have done this and during desegregation
13:43 here in the United States of America we
13:45 had you know white people saying
13:47 horrible things to the black kids that
13:49 were coming into the schools and they
13:51 desegregated the schools meaning blacks
13:53 and whites could be in the same
13:54 classroom together and it was through
13:57 desegregation that why people realize I
14:01 have been fearing black people for no
14:03 reason whatsoever I don't know of any
14:06 claim the other way but I'm not sure the
14:11 prejudice went the other way as much as
14:14 the former right but what if we just had
14:18 these two people in the room you know
14:20 that forcing them to get along isn't
14:22 gonna do much they're gonna have to
14:23 experience life you're gonna have to be
14:26 in maybe a dire situation where one of
14:28 them knows how to find food but the
14:30 other one is the only one that knows how
14:31 to cook it safely and through hanging
14:34 out on a desert island maybe they even
14:37 fisticuff it for a little while with the
14:40 bruised face and broken arm or whatever
14:42 they managed to cook their first meal
14:44 together and then start laughing about
14:47 how ridiculous they were the law doesn't
14:51 make it happen necessarily experiencing
14:55 things makes it happen there's this
14:57 whole difference in world between
14:59 knowledge and wisdom right knowledge is
15:02 what you read out of a book
15:04 sometimes books are written by people
15:06 who have traveled the world like Jack
15:08 London or something but sometimes
15:10 they're written by academics that never
15:12 leave their school telling you how life
15:16 is never having experienced it wisdom is
15:20 going out and figuring out
15:23 hey you just need to Snug the the lug
15:26 bolt don't impact it down so hard that
15:29 it breaks something right that's wisdom
15:32 it says put a cup of water in your
15:35 oatmeal yeah if you do that's a little
15:36 too soupy either put more oatmeal and
15:38 they say but less water yeah
15:40 that's wisdom so let's move into some of
15:44 the subjects here because I know you're
15:45 done listening to my theory what are the
15:47 ones that I talked about it in the
15:51 middle of episodes is global warming for
15:57 us old school folks that want to shove
16:00 it up their butt we always say global
16:02 warming because that's what they
16:03 initially called it didn't they until
16:05 they realized that it's actually global
16:07 cooling and they need a way to take
16:10 advantage of everything that happens and
16:12 so in their cowardice way they changed
16:16 the name of it to climate change the
16:21 theory is very simple and because it's
16:22 very simple
16:24 they lose their saying that the co2 in
16:29 the atmosphere created by man is warming
16:33 the earth and that we in first world
16:35 countries where we barely contribute to
16:39 the co2 output globally well we're gonna
16:44 have to pay a bunch of taxes we're gonna
16:47 have to buy carbon credits all right
16:50 co2 credits basically now before I get
16:55 into this little rant here let's be
16:57 clear oil is not the best fuel in the
17:01 world Stan Myers figured out how to run
17:03 a car on tap water okay he made the
17:07 engine several times they murdered him
17:09 in 1998 by poisoning some juice at his
17:12 house after offering him 1.1 billion
17:15 dollars
17:16 hand over his patents and go away he was
17:20 a religious man and thought he was
17:21 protected by angels I also don't think
17:23 that manufacturing plants should be
17:25 barfing out tons of soot into the air in
17:29 foreign third-world countries that are
17:32 desperately trying to become first of
17:33 all countries well let's face it the
17:37 ocean emits more co2 than man will ever
17:40 admit what a volcano erupts which
17:43 happens every single year somewhere in
17:45 the world it Trump's an entire output of
17:48 a year of co2 for man in any country in
17:52 the world in one shot so co2 was a bad
17:57 thing which it's not there's no way we
18:01 could do anything to stop the Earth's
18:02 natural co2 emissions when things decay
18:07 they go back to their native form and
18:09 when they do they create a co2 signature
18:13 in the sky but we're forgetting science
18:16 as we're making excuses right we're
18:19 making excuses about co2 but there is an
18:23 index of chemicals on a piece of paper
18:25 that they call the greenhouse gas layer
18:27 it is essentially everything in the
18:30 world that's up there in the sky that
18:32 keeps us warm down here the thing that
18:34 this the layer of materials that lock us
18:36 lock all the heat in to our atmosphere
18:38 so we don't freeze oh co2 is up there in
18:43 the index but the percentage is so
18:47 teeny-tiny the entire world's signature
18:51 is nothing as the I believe the head
18:56 meteorologists at MIT said it's point
18:59 zero five four percent of a single
19:01 percent meaning if again I take your
19:05 television we make the screen black and
19:07 we see that's everything else and the
19:09 white pixel is co2 you would need a
19:13 magnifying glass to see the partial led
19:15 that's gonna light up on that screen
19:17 it's so teeny tiny but they're trying to
19:21 legislate it into your belief system
19:24 aren't they now they know they can't yet
19:28 believe me they're trying
19:30 past laws the EU is just such a condom
19:34 for anything horrible in the world right
19:37 there probably passed it in the EU first
19:41 and correct me if by March of 2018 if
19:45 they've done it or not I've not heard
19:47 that news but they're gonna try to say
19:49 that if you deny this theory this
19:52 absurdity that that counteracts
19:54 everything that we know about the
19:56 greenhouse gas layer and how the world
19:58 works
19:59 if you don't allow them to go inside
20:03 your mind and force you to believe
20:06 something that there's gonna be jail
20:07 time Europe is littered with laws like
20:11 this the the sheer complicit nosov
20:14 people in Europe blows my mind how you
20:18 can wake up every day I go yeah this is
20:20 a great place to live yeah I got all
20:22 these laws that tell me what I have to
20:23 believe you know the difference would be
20:27 we have a law that says you can't murder
20:29 people probably a good law right but
20:32 that's not a belief that's just what's
20:34 going to happen to you that's
20:35 consequence and then you could develop
20:38 your belief system around the idea that
20:39 well I probably should never rationalize
20:41 killing someone because it's really
20:43 gonna have a lot of repercussions on my
20:45 life
20:47 hopefully it's not so clinical but they
20:50 know it's a two-step process
20:52 you can't take discerning adults I guess
20:57 forty and over that didn't get
20:58 vaccinated to death that have something
21:03 we call backbone and get us to go
21:07 against our principles we see the BS we
21:12 see it so what they've done is they've
21:15 gone into classrooms of children and
21:17 shown them al gore's movie An
21:19 Inconvenient Truth so that when they
21:23 they do want to pass this thought police
21:26 law well those kids are going to be the
21:28 ones that go yay and if this ever gets
21:32 passed which I think that with Donald
21:34 Trump in office he's been able to gut it
21:36 out of the EPA thank God
21:39 you're going from one child households
21:42 now
21:43 you know if you believe in this [ __ ]
21:45 and you have to buy carbon credits to
21:48 being able to have two three kids you
21:51 know if you live in any first world
21:52 country your population is most likely
21:57 declining at an alarming rate European
22:01 populations of all the European
22:03 countries including Britain are just
22:06 skyrocketing down you know I think
22:11 within a hundred years if there's anyone
22:13 in this world who is French it'll be
22:17 because they moved to America to be
22:19 protected
22:20 well it'll be part of the bloodline of
22:22 an American this is yeah get some French
22:24 French blood because the French are
22:27 going extinct you know and this is why
22:31 when you get this sort of super coffee
22:33 arrogant you know Society of we know
22:37 everything we've been around so long
22:39 haha they can take you for everything
22:42 that you have to give right who's the
22:45 guy that gets mugged walking down the
22:47 street that's the guy has no idea that
22:49 being mugged happens and his little
22:52 dorky walk of like oh I'm totally in
22:54 charge of my life he's the first target
22:57 of a person who's going to mug somebody
23:00 so they're trying to better it in
23:02 culture there was some play recently
23:04 started somewhere in the United States I
23:06 believe where it's kill climate deniers
23:09 is like one of the themes of the play so
23:12 little kids I've been brainwashed up to
23:14 the point where some some teacher out
23:17 there has you know swallowed this I
23:20 don't have a cause in life so I'm gonna
23:21 grab a hold of the next banner or
23:23 propaganda that goes in front of my face
23:25 and somehow wrote this play of course
23:28 because it doesn't exist anywhere it's
23:29 not a Gilbert and Sullivan play from the
23:31 1800's someone drafted up this play and
23:34 has kids playing out the role of killing
23:36 people who don't believe in horseshit
23:38 right now I did an episode as well on
23:43 gender Wars back in season one and it's
23:46 sort of a touchy subject right the weird
23:50 thing is is that if you're just a
23:51 biologist and you really have no social
23:54 emotion
23:55 you just have to you know your first
23:58 take on gender is to say well there's an
24:00 innie and there's an Audi an order to
24:03 procreate as human beings those two have
24:06 to get together they have to get off one
24:13 inseminates the other woman carries the
24:16 baby to full term and you make a child
24:19 that is the way that our species was
24:21 designed right no one tries to breed two
24:25 male dogs together no one tries to breed
24:27 two female dogs together if they want to
24:29 sell dogs and so the scientific reality
24:33 is that man and woman comprise the
24:38 biological requirements for procreation
24:40 but no one says you have to procreate
24:43 right so we don't necessarily get all
24:46 bent out of shape if two women want to
24:48 be together for a lifetime two men want
24:49 to get together for a lifetime it's fine
24:51 where their guy wants to dress like a
24:53 girl have all those bits and parts cut
24:56 off and simulate being a woman amen if
24:59 you wanted to do that then you obviously
25:01 believe that's what you should do you're
25:05 not hurting me I don't think you're
25:07 really hurting anyone else so how about
25:09 it right you know I have friends in
25:11 Hollywood that are much older and gay
25:14 and I've had conversations with them
25:16 together the two spouses together and I
25:19 said you know what was it like growing
25:20 up in the 40s 50s 60s 70s 80s you know
25:23 gay and they just said it wasn't a big
25:26 deal I was just watching an episode of
25:29 What's My Line it was 1956 the
25:33 transvestite comes on and what the way
25:36 the show works is that the word line
25:39 means work job what's your job What's My
25:42 Line what's my job they have to sign in
25:44 on a blackboard and they introduced the
25:47 panel that guess is you know 20
25:48 questions or whatever and then they sit
25:50 down and I see this man's hand writing
25:53 the name gene and they're you know men
25:55 with kind of androgynous names and then
25:59 but there's a woman in a dress like it
26:01 was a dress person I'm going oh my gosh
26:03 I prejudged those man hands right then
26:06 the person sat down
26:08 I went through the entire show with you
26:11 know which is about a three to five
26:14 minute segment total Adam's apple
26:16 definitely a guy in a dress he was from
26:20 San Francisco he was a ferry driver
26:22 right they treated him like a woman I
26:27 forgot the last name but they refer to
26:29 him as missus this and missus that he
26:32 said he was married he was mrs. wells
26:34 definitely a man definitely okay no one
26:40 no one had a [ __ ] fit on the show no one
26:43 made any jokes and what's kind of funny
26:45 about it is that if a beautiful woman
26:49 came comes on that show usually the the
26:51 the panelists they're trying to guess
26:53 their job will sit well does your beauty
26:54 factor into your job if the guy is real
26:56 burly and kind of like a lumberjack
26:58 they'll say you know use your physical
27:02 prowess have anything to do with what
27:03 you do but no one touched the fact that
27:06 this guy had an Adam's apple and a dress
27:08 on they treated him like a lady 19:56
27:14 people live television CBS Sunday night
27:18 but what my friends recently told me was
27:22 it the thing that's starting to cause
27:24 them a problem is that that the subject
27:27 of being gay has been so pushed on
27:29 society and the more flamboyant of the
27:33 two parties I've been so pushed in the
27:37 face of society it's causing the
27:39 resistance because what they're trying
27:42 to do is say you know we're gonna try to
27:45 take over the mind of your child the
27:47 second it's born confuse it by
27:50 forbidding that they use the gender of
27:53 identification the biological
27:55 identification of what they are a boy or
27:58 a girl that is the state getting
28:04 involved with the overall mental
28:06 development of a child now as I've said
28:09 on the show a couple times a long time
28:10 ago you know I have one relative that
28:14 had a mother it was kind of psychotic
28:16 she had had two sons and she wanted a
28:18 daughter she pushed her husband for
28:20 another child he didn't want one but he
28:22 caved in well she had another boy well
28:26 she she couldn't handle it so she just
28:30 her third child like a girl until he's
28:32 probably bought 12 years old I've seen a
28:34 photograph of him at nine and he was
28:35 dressed in a dress
28:37 he had a bob haircut and you look like a
28:40 little girl
28:42 today he's gay so what do you think the
28:45 odds are did he had a crazy mother just
28:50 like a girl until he's 12 and that he
28:53 likes boys she got in on her kid quickly
28:56 and crafted his identification as a girl
29:00 so whether or not there's a gene there's
29:04 definitely a social mechanism that you
29:05 can do to kids to make it happen I had a
29:08 brilliant friend of mine as a PhD in
29:10 microbiology
29:11 he went searching for the gay gene
29:12 because he was gay and I I said well did
29:16 you find it cuz I was super excited he
29:18 goes no because I don't think it exists
29:20 this guy is he's he should be a hundred
29:24 millionaire by now because he you know
29:26 he invented polyphonic ringtones with
29:29 Thomas Dolby which they sold for 1.1
29:32 billion dollars
29:34 he's not an idiot
29:36 so I said well what do you think's
29:38 making you feel this way he said well
29:41 it's pretty simple because I don't I'm
29:44 awkward I'm autistic
29:45 he was Rain Man autistic and not drool
29:49 all over yourself vaccinations
29:51 brain-damaged autistic he just said look
29:54 I've been awkward my whole life and he
29:56 goes the one sex I have access to
29:58 constantly is our mitten and I don't
30:01 have any access to women really I try to
30:03 approach them and my weirdness starts to
30:05 take over cuz I'm nervous anyway and he
30:09 said you know I think I've just my body
30:12 just adapted that's it it's okay
30:16 but the depopulation agenda is pretty
30:20 intense right if you believe that you're
30:24 attracted to your own sex or that you're
30:27 a furry you think you're a stuffed
30:30 animal or something right
30:33 yeah there's a lot of people out there
30:35 of both genders who get in furry stuff
30:38 but what if you like your own sex what
30:40 are the odds that you're gonna have a
30:41 child
30:43 some people adopt but honestly it's not
30:45 as much as you might think it's to make
30:49 sure that your kids do not find a
30:52 successful relationship with someone
30:53 that will yield a child autism
30:59 vaccinations vaccines flu shots now I've
31:04 got an episode back in season one on Big
31:07 Pharma if you're interested in this
31:08 please get into that because I used to
31:10 work at big pharma at a very intense
31:12 level that I haven't met anyone else in
31:14 my life who's done so you should go take
31:16 a look at that if you're interested just
31:18 you know every YouTube channel has a
31:22 search field and every well the deep
31:27 thoughts radio.com has the search field
31:28 the top I just remembered I need to cut
31:30 back and swap out all the links for
31:31 season one on my website anyway so I
31:36 have a very close friend of mine he's a
31:39 genius young guy early 30s maybe you'd
31:43 mid 30s now I met him before he was 30 I
31:46 believe in the music industry he's a
31:50 very wealthy kid he was home-schooled by
31:54 private tutors and he's just brilliant
31:58 just a brilliant guy and his brother is
32:03 sort of a blond carbon copy of him
32:05 they're both big guys six foot five and
32:08 somehow his brothers autistic don't know
32:11 how not sure but it wasn't until I hung
32:15 out with the family and saw this big
32:19 lovable kid you can't talk he's a sweet
32:24 like gentle giant he he has you know
32:28 things that he does that he physically
32:30 does to keep himself busy right and I
32:33 realized sitting there at dinner once
32:36 that he's never gonna have any kids
32:40 he's never gonna fall in love in any
32:44 significant way that someone's going to
32:45 probably spend a life
32:47 time with him and loved him back and I
32:50 think that regardless of how your brain
32:51 works that's probably a primal thing
32:53 that we need as human beings
32:56 now he's surrounded by people who love
32:58 him constantly but they're more of his
33:00 caretakers right but these
33:02 pharmaceutical companies aren't stupid
33:05 they know you don't need any of this
33:07 [ __ ] in fact they're creating more
33:09 problems with your immune systems by
33:11 giving you these lazy inoculations early
33:14 in life right if you get a small oh I'm
33:17 sorry if you get a chickenpox shot for
33:19 your kid your kid now has a high
33:22 likelihood of getting shingles as an
33:25 adult which are extremely painful
33:27 physically scarring and imagine you're
33:30 trying to do something really intense
33:33 with your adult life and all sudden you
33:36 catch a we come down with an illness
33:38 that's gonna take you out for half a
33:41 year and it's painful and you got to
33:44 raise your kids now you're out of a
33:46 freakin job because you're out of your
33:47 you're sick leave or maybe they don't
33:50 fire you but they're like we can't
33:51 continue paying you if you're not going
33:52 to come to work mumps and measles if you
33:57 get them when you're young as a girl it
33:59 protects you against ovarian cancer as
34:01 an adult why do you think cancer is out
34:04 of control why are kids getting cancer
34:06 before they're 30 for Christ's sake in
34:09 California we have an absolute traitor
34:11 for a Governor Jerry Brown Jerry Brown
34:16 is a very timid shy little boy and he
34:23 could be pushed around he probably has
34:25 been pushed around his whole life but he
34:27 would probably be the kids that you
34:28 could get lunch money out of every
34:30 single day and he wouldn't tell his
34:31 parents it's happening and so when the
34:34 big farmer comes in when the deep state
34:36 comes in and says to him passed the law
34:39 that says that all the children of
34:41 California one of the largest states in
34:43 the Union of the United States of
34:45 America with the highest population when
34:48 that scumbag allows vaccinations to
34:51 become mandatory which he did you
34:55 screwed up
34:57 one of the largest populations of this
34:59 country think about it Silicon Valley is
35:03 in this state a lot of the art and
35:07 entertainment is in this state you know
35:11 just came out that Bill Gates refuses to
35:13 vaccinate his children hmm how many
35:15 times has he done a speech telling you
35:16 that vaccinations are gonna solve all
35:18 the world's problems by depopulating in
35:20 Africa but they pass laws they
35:24 legislated it's all to reduce world
35:29 population and to make us slaves
35:32 literally little ATM machines that go
35:35 and fetch money for our rulers how much
35:39 longer do you want to do this because
35:41 I'm done all right Europe how much
35:46 longer do you want to be in the EU you
35:49 have to be in a level of cognitive
35:52 dissidence that is record breaking
35:55 Guinness Book World Record levels to
35:59 wake up every day and think that the
36:01 European Union is doing you a solid if
36:05 you are part of Europe hopefully Italy
36:09 pulls out Rex it's already got gone
36:11 through America has got a whole nother
36:15 chance on its hands right if you are in
36:19 your country and you have a ruler a
36:22 monarch on your money and you don't even
36:25 live in that country that's probably a
36:28 sign you should probably change your
36:30 mind and take over your country and get
36:32 it back right now as I touched on in
36:36 thought police I'm just gonna lightly
36:39 touch on it here there's a very
36:42 sensitive one out there that I believe
36:45 there's still 14 countries that refuse
36:47 you the right to question its historical
36:51 accuracy and that is the Holocaust of
36:56 World War two and I detailed in my
36:59 thought police episode way back in
37:02 season 1 the details of this so I won't
37:05 do that again here you're interested in
37:07 the hearing we talk about the
37:09 discrepancies as mentioned by
37:11 like priests and Jewish rabbis and
37:14 Jewish kids that have gone over and done
37:16 photographic proof of all this stuff
37:18 it's pretty phenomenal but what has the
37:22 internet done to every other sector of
37:24 history
37:25 what is it done to the state of today is
37:28 revealed lies right how many people in
37:32 America thought that we actually own the
37:34 money that we have held in our pockets
37:36 since we were kids only to find out that
37:39 it says Federal Reserve Note across the
37:41 top and then it's actually made by a
37:42 private for-profit company called the
37:45 Federal Reserve but more federal than
37:47 Federal Express as they say right how
37:50 many people thought the Vietnam War
37:51 started due to a true event called the
37:54 gulf of tonkin until the internet came
37:56 by and said no those two events were
37:59 cited by the murderous traitor
38:02 LBJ who killed Kennedy with his buddies
38:05 on behalf of the banks and everyone else
38:07 that was gonna get squashed by JFK nope
38:12 it never happened how many people knew
38:15 that Pearl Harbor was orchestrated by
38:17 Roosevelt and that the two Admirals Navy
38:21 Admirals that pulled the fleet away from
38:23 Hawaii to drive in circles in the ocean
38:26 while the Japanese Armada came down and
38:28 bombed the [ __ ] out of us that Roosevelt
38:31 gave them secretly the naval Maria
38:34 Buddle of Honor for following orders to
38:37 make sure that World War two started for
38:39 America
38:42 now you may rationalize all those things
38:45 all those things had to happen dude we
38:46 needed to be in Vietnam forever how many
38:50 people know that Saddam Hussein asked
38:51 for permission from the United States
38:53 State Department to invade Kuwait as a
38:55 CIA asset and he got permission to do it
38:59 and then the Saudis freaked out and said
39:01 what are you doing get him out of there
39:03 and then we backstabbed Saddam Hussein
39:06 and went and chased him out the internet
39:10 has revealed facts that aren't
39:15 technically allowed to be known when you
39:19 go to school you know Civic history or
39:23 social studies
39:25 or US history that you might learn in
39:29 America K through 12 and even if you get
39:31 a PhD in the subject matter in college
39:33 pretty much everything I just said
39:36 won't be taught because if you start
39:40 realizing that they have lied to you
39:42 since the very very beginning crafting
39:46 history to you know pump up patriotism
39:50 and all this other crap then it's gonna
39:52 unravel for them which is why most of
39:56 the college books and high school books
39:58 and grade school books and middle school
40:00 books are all written by European
40:02 publishers it's a joke man it's a joke
40:07 laughing their asses off and even if you
40:09 find an American publisher on a book for
40:11 one of your kids go look them up on the
40:14 internet find out who owns that that
40:16 publishing company that happens to have
40:18 an address in Chicago or New York a lot
40:21 of times you'll find a bank attached to
40:22 it across the ocean there's an
40:25 interesting thing going on right now and
40:27 I've seen it firsthand in some of the
40:29 business ventures I've been involved in
40:30 in Los Angeles as the internet starts to
40:34 question all the events of World War two
40:37 and especially the Holocaust revealing
40:40 all kinds of facts about how they've
40:42 deprecated various quote unquote
40:45 concentration camps out of the history
40:48 books saying well yeah this one wasn't
40:50 used to kill anybody okay there's two
40:51 million people back in the population
40:53 and this one wasn't used well there's no
40:57 other 1 million people that are back in
40:59 the population because these two have
41:01 been pulled out by historians as being
41:02 anything but just places that detain
41:05 human beings they weren't used as death
41:07 camps but but the history book said two
41:08 million there and 1 million there that's
41:10 that's a real fact they've actually
41:12 redone plaques over there and pull
41:14 various camps off these plaques because
41:16 now history says it's impossible for
41:18 these two facilities to be used Dachau
41:22 being one of them thought of its being
41:24 one of them but you can go over there
41:25 and visit and they'll tell you how all
41:26 these people died when you talk to some
41:28 of the historians again these are Jewish
41:30 rabbis acidic Jew rabbis that go you
41:33 know some happen it was horrible we can
41:35 still call it the h-word but these two
41:37 places can't be used as that
41:40 I'm just telling you what what I've
41:42 heard them testify to in multiple
41:45 occasions you know Russia is killing
41:48 tens of millions of their own people for
41:51 deserting during war melts a tongue we
41:55 don't even know how many millions of
41:56 people this guy killed the the most
41:59 conservative estimate I've heard is 30
42:02 million around the same time a world war
42:06 2 is going on the Russians did it right
42:08 during World War two because of World
42:09 War two where's the big memorial to that
42:15 those deaths there is none why because
42:18 the country killed its own people and
42:20 that's something that they don't want to
42:22 remember but the Internet has allowed us
42:26 to remember it to mourn the loss to
42:29 learn the lesson at least in a few of us
42:31 that are awake right but where are the
42:34 laws over there this communist Russian
42:37 spookie ookie red country where are the
42:40 laws in Russia they say that they can't
42:43 talk about what happened over there I
42:46 have friends that have done their sort
42:50 of Rhodes Scholar work to finish their
42:53 degrees over there and they said there
42:55 there's no problem talking about it
42:56 state doesn't come and pick you up and
42:58 put you in some death camp because you
43:00 talked about it I think they learned
43:03 their lesson and they moved on but there
43:05 is a reinforced earth the lie so if the
43:15 Internet again is starting to chop down
43:16 the tree of the lie then the people who
43:19 support it and benefit from the lie
43:21 start building it back up again right
43:24 yeah Al Gore and his global warming
43:27 horseshit well let's not forget he
43:30 bought a house in Montecito that
43:33 according to his movie released in late
43:36 2006 was going to be under water by 2010
43:41 well it's uh
43:44 12 years later he still owns that house
43:48 I think his electric bill is something
43:51 like $60,000 a month
43:53 among all his estates he talked about
43:57 all the sexual harassment that's getting
43:59 people thrown out of their companies
44:00 well that guy is had he said the police
44:05 called on him because he was chasing his
44:07 maid around his house naked in a robe
44:11 power corrupts and absolute power
44:13 corrupts absolutely right so what do we
44:17 do about this there are dozens and
44:20 dozens of examples of this kind of stuff
44:22 happening everywhere right here's my
44:26 guidelines for you guys most of you
44:30 already do this I understand I'm
44:33 preaching to the choir but sometimes we
44:35 need a little bit of a reminder to get
44:38 our convictions back you can feel when
44:41 someone is trying to push thought police
44:44 inside your brain you believe one way
44:48 and they're trying to take it away from
44:51 you now most cases it's a friendly
44:54 difference between religions what do you
44:56 believe I don't necessarily mean God
44:59 religion but it could be it could be a
45:01 science religion for those of you who
45:03 still believe the world is flat
45:05 well you that's your religion that's I
45:07 don't mean that in a derogatory way at
45:09 all it's your belief system right your
45:11 system of belief and you get used to
45:15 hearing the way it was it's round it's
45:18 round it's round it's round and you
45:20 could probably deal with it but if
45:23 someone came in and said this is the
45:25 Inquisition of heliocentric belief you
45:29 must believe you must tell us that you
45:31 believe you must tell us you believe
45:33 what you don't believe on a regular
45:35 interval matter of fact you're going to
45:37 be forced to go to assembly in your
45:40 hometown or wherever you live you're
45:41 gonna have to come to the parade you
45:43 have to wear a pin on your shirt every
45:47 day that says you believe this other
45:48 thing that you don't believe if that
45:51 kind of lunacy were to occur you would
45:54 have probably 51% eventually join them
45:57 and just say you know
45:58 I'm tired of fighting this belief war
46:00 I'm just gonna cave in and that's where
46:02 you get a lot of your global warmers the
46:04 people that don't research anything they
46:07 just read an article that rah-rahs the
46:09 theory doesn't link back to any
46:12 scientific proof they're ready to go and
46:14 they are right they are on the winning
46:16 team it's usually how it works right but
46:20 there's some of you regardless of what
46:21 people will try to force on you be at
46:25 law or be at suggestion you simply will
46:27 not capitulate now the caveat to that is
46:32 well we don't want to just fight other
46:36 notions because we're just fighting to
46:38 fight we do want to do our research
46:40 right I trusted that most of you would
46:42 sit you know fifty minutes to this
46:45 episode I've already done that kind of
46:48 thing in my opinion what I have found to
46:52 be a useful exercise is to say and you
46:57 guys do it on the locked facebook page a
46:58 lot let's say that you woke up to
47:03 something
47:03 for those of you who woke up to 911 well
47:07 you know that most of the world is
47:09 pretty scared of that kind of power if
47:13 that kind of evil deed and just like I
47:16 mentioned in previous episodes there's a
47:19 threshold of evil that you're willing to
47:21 accept and then you can't accept any
47:23 more evil beyond that point a lot of the
47:26 stuff we're finding out about
47:29 politicians and heads of state the deep
47:33 state people right so these are the
47:34 heads of agencies that do intelligence
47:37 not all of them but some of them a lot
47:40 of politicians do this and a lot of
47:42 Hollywood people do this when they hurt
47:43 children they sacrifice children
47:49 for some unbelievable idea of pleasure
47:55 we can barely conceive of that right who
47:59 the hell wants to conceive that nobody
48:01 does but if we don't conceive of it then
48:03 those children never get saved they
48:06 never get saved because we don't have
48:07 the conversation that it's even possible
48:09 well if we can't have the conversation
48:11 that it's possible when we have tons of
48:13 evidence that it's happening then we're
48:18 just letting the screams in the night go
48:22 unheeded right a lot of us are powerless
48:26 to really do anything about it
48:27 besides spread the information help
48:30 people find the evidence but there are
48:33 people on the inside that see it happen
48:36 and they don't say a word and some
48:39 people are starting to say things are
48:41 starting to blow whistles but even
48:44 that's a tough thing to do but to go
48:47 back to my point with 911 what's
48:50 happened we keep trying to find the
48:52 easiest smoking gun for people who are
48:56 yet to believe that was an inside job to
48:59 consider that oh yeah that is impossible
49:01 isn't it and you go yeah it's really
49:03 weird right right not calling them an
49:06 idiot not calling them stupid it's been
49:08 17 years since that have been occurred I
49:11 have told the most average housewife
49:19 over and over and over different people
49:23 about pretty much everything we talk
49:25 about on this show even the children
49:28 thing the abduction the human
49:31 trafficking and what I have found is
49:34 that as long as the person trusts you
49:36 and you can answer whatever question
49:40 they ask if they want to dig deeper
49:41 you've got the next level ready for them
49:44 in the next level in the next level
49:45 they're willing to listen and they're
49:49 even willing to believe and that's a
49:52 real good sign because what's
49:55 interesting about it is there's very I
49:58 don't know if there's anyone more
50:00 qualified to care about children for
50:02 instance
50:02 than a housewife with children than a
50:05 mother they're always played off is
50:09 really meek right it's really ridiculous
50:11 but you know you don't know what's funny
50:15 is I'm sure this is the case but you
50:17 don't hear about those miraculous
50:18 stories where a kid is trapped under a
50:20 car dude an accident and a father lifts
50:22 the car off the child what are the
50:25 miraculous stories you hear the mother
50:28 found super strength and lift the car
50:31 off the kid there's this theory going on
50:34 right now online and for those of you
50:37 watched a lot of YouTube videos with a
50:38 lot of interviews from whistleblowers
50:42 giving those interviews you know they
50:45 keep saying over and over right now in
50:47 2018 that the truth is so horrific that
50:52 supposedly Donald Trump and sessions
50:55 have uncovered that the American people
51:00 could not possibly hear it and stay sane
51:05 and so the big underground story is that
51:08 they are preparing military tribunals
51:11 against all these child traffickers and
51:14 they're going to do it in quiet senators
51:19 who are not going to be reelected or
51:22 they're not going for office they're
51:24 retiring or some of these people we have
51:28 a record number of people that aren't
51:29 going to renew their membership to the
51:33 Senate order Congress and they're on
51:36 both sides of the fence by the way
51:37 there's no one side of this whole thing
51:39 you know they say choose your battles in
51:41 life right because you can't fight every
51:44 battle on every front when you wake up
51:46 in the morning and this goes for every
51:47 human being on planet Earth and it
51:49 pretty much goes for every age that you
51:51 could possibly be and there's a
51:53 tremendous amount of truth to that and
51:55 if you are one that wants to fight for
51:57 truth and justice and the free way of
52:01 living right it's very difficult to say
52:05 well I'm going to I'm going to skip this
52:08 one really important jinda because I've
52:10 already got another super-important
52:12 Genda on my plate
52:15 you know what if what if you're a
52:17 scientist that could contribute most
52:21 most of your efforts to proving that
52:24 climate change is a bunch of crap it has
52:28 no basis in reality beyond the climate
52:30 changes and this is natural you know
52:32 anything to worry about you have a PhD
52:34 in it and 30 years experience in it you
52:37 have wisdom but for whatever reason you
52:41 have the drop on child trafficking human
52:45 trafficking and so you wake up and you
52:47 go Jesus I can't fight both these I
52:49 gotta make a decision if climate change
52:52 goes through and carbon taxation becomes
52:55 a facet of society then we're gonna be
53:00 taxed to death I mean the population is
53:02 going to disappear but if we let kids
53:05 get trafficked around by these
53:07 pedophiles right the Lolita Island guy
53:10 right the Home Shopping Network founder
53:13 you can't deal with that this person
53:16 right they just can't deal with it they
53:18 can't go to bed at night thinking about
53:20 what happens to a couple kids then they
53:23 have to make a decision maybe they can
53:26 fight both fronts maybe they can it's a
53:29 tough tough thing right now we have
53:33 essentially revolutions going on in all
53:36 kinds of different categories of life
53:37 right now freedom there's a whole
53:41 separate agenda I kind of skipped the
53:43 massacres that keep going on these faux
53:45 massacres these hybrids where they
53:47 actually kill people but they're
53:49 orchestrated it's a real tough subject
53:53 but it's it's pretty much a generic
53:54 archetype but if you go against the
53:57 grain if you're able to watch YouTube
53:59 helicopter videos of the murderers that
54:01 come out of the schools that hop in back
54:03 a white pickup trucks with their big
54:04 duffel bags of guns completely covered
54:07 head-to-toe in armor with face masks so
54:10 that no one could find out who they are
54:11 I was reported by some teachers who
54:13 weren't in on it they want to make you
54:16 crazy but no one asks who are those guys
54:20 who are those guys leaving the school in
54:23 the back of a truck go look up that
54:25 video white pickup Florida School
54:28 Parklane it'll blow your mind trying to
54:33 go after the Second Amendment in the
54:34 United States of America one little
54:37 component at a time in the end we can't
54:41 let them demonize lucidity demonize
54:45 critical thinking isn't it interesting
54:48 that we have our little client here on
54:52 deep thoughts wouldn't we live for
54:53 critical thinking you have this cue and
54:56 on guy all over the internet trying to
54:59 tell people look you have to think I
55:01 can't just give you all the answers I've
55:03 got to talk in cryptic messages because
55:05 if I don't make you search for it like a
55:07 treasure hunt then you're not going to
55:09 have the critical thinking you need when
55:11 you find the proof you're just gonna go
55:14 into denial but if I make this a bit of
55:17 a game for you you're gonna have to
55:19 think
55:20 sadly the dude isn't posting anymore but
55:23 well hopefully that'll change well why
55:25 isn't the government even of the United
55:28 States of America right I live here and
55:30 I'm big rah-rah citizen of this country
55:32 which I am there's a couple things that
55:36 this country never does it never comes
55:39 out and says we have to promote classes
55:42 that promote critical thinking why
55:46 wouldn't you want your citizens to think
55:48 critically oh because you're duping them
55:50 that's why another thing our country
55:53 never does which is sort of off topic
55:55 but why hasn't the United States of
55:57 America come up with an issue to define
56:00 a zero point energy system shouldn't
56:03 that be a public challenge when the
56:06 British government wanted to create
56:07 accurate maps this is how I've heard it
56:09 told in the 1850s somewhere in there
56:12 they put out a contest I believe for a
56:14 hundred thousand pound sterling to
56:17 develop a clock device so accurate that
56:19 it could measure longitude on a map when
56:22 they sail around the sea well a guy did
56:26 it got the hundred thousand pounds and
56:28 now the world had accurate maps once
56:30 again we had in the past but we
56:33 rediscovered it why not do that again
56:37 why wouldn't a government say let's have
56:39 anti-gravity someone figure it out
56:41 now if you study history by the mid 60s
56:44 nearly every top university in this
56:47 country had professors teaching multiple
56:50 ways to create zero gravity no one had
56:53 the funds to build the device or build
56:55 the equipment that I know of but they I
56:58 watched lectures where teachers are
57:02 writing on the board in 65 when you feel
57:06 someone pushing into your brain here's a
57:10 couple things to keep in mind if you're
57:12 just talking to your buddy
57:13 and they're disagreeing with you don't
57:15 get all hostile just realize you have
57:17 someone across the table that for
57:20 whatever type of personality they are
57:22 whatever information they've read
57:24 they're still at that level and they may
57:27 have walked in your shoes and they may
57:29 not have walked in your shoes when you
57:31 talk to me if you're sitting on this
57:32 patio and we have a discussion about
57:34 Flat Earth as I said and as you
57:37 witnessed on this show I have been down
57:39 that path I have completely had days and
57:41 weeks even that I believed maybe it is
57:43 that way you know how would I know it's
57:46 around I haven't been in space yeah
57:48 planets around and the sun's around the
57:50 moons around I don't know maybe that's
57:53 something else going on up there
57:54 I don't know so when I say I don't
57:57 believe it anymore because of expanding
57:58 earth which I mean an episode on you
58:03 know you can at least respect the fact
58:05 that I've been in your shoes up to a
58:06 point right if you believe that Jesus is
58:09 your Savior and you hear on this show
58:11 that I routinely do not think that he
58:14 ever existed at least you can respect
58:17 the fact that I studied the Bible
58:19 intensely for years intensely right and
58:24 I want to throw a little footnote in
58:25 here the funny thing about Christ one of
58:29 the clues I think that's right in front
58:30 of your face is that when Christ is on
58:33 this planet let's just say he was real
58:36 he spoke in fictional parables the
58:39 entire time he was here he taught
58:42 everyone how to behave by telling
58:44 stories again these stories are actually
58:48 written in Egyptian hieroglyphs just so
58:50 you guys know I have the books with the
58:53 hieroglyphs their locations and their
58:55 transit
58:55 patience so prodigal son' stuff it's all
58:58 in it's all in ancient Egyptian script
59:01 but he spoke to you using examples that
59:05 you could understand easily so that you
59:07 would know how to behave because we need
59:08 a moral base in this world we do we've
59:11 seen the world without morals we're
59:13 seeing it again right but what I think
59:16 is interesting is we value what he did
59:19 in story but we can't roll that up to
59:24 him we can't say well then maybe he is
59:26 also a fictional parable of which has
59:28 massive value to us right what's nice
59:32 about the story of Christ is that he
59:35 doesn't offend to my knowledge any
59:38 culture anywhere in the world be you
59:41 Arab Jew Asian white South American he
59:46 doesn't offend you his ways of living as
59:52 portrayed in this story are universal
59:55 you don't have to get all butthurt and
59:59 so there's a value to his story whether
60:01 he be real or not doesn't matter we
60:04 should read it and understand it and
60:05 fold that into our own being
60:07 as far as do no harm with common law he
60:11 is the best manual I've ever heard
60:13 written down now
60:15 Buddha's got some great things as well a
60:17 lot of philosophers have great things to
60:20 say well before I close let's rewind to
60:24 one of the theories that I've talked
60:26 about several times on this show to give
60:28 you a bit of a spiritual guide to what
60:33 you might want to allow into your system
60:34 and what you should probably block from
60:36 your system but even if you block you
60:38 still need to keep a record of what
60:40 you've blocked right any of you've got
60:42 email packages or or you got a Facebook
60:45 page and you've blocked a few of your
60:46 friends for being crazy you know that
60:49 you can go into the settings and look at
60:50 the list of people that you've blocked
60:52 that you've blacklisted out of your line
60:54 of communication when you have something
60:57 revealed to you that feels truthful you
61:01 get an amazing cool sensation over your
61:05 soul a very liberating
61:09 wonderful feeling it's as if you know
61:12 when you play video games it's really
61:13 funny any of you've ever ever played a
61:15 video game that had some sort of puzzle
61:17 you needed to undo you've played Sudoku
61:21 or you've done a logic problem in a Dell
61:23 book or something like that
61:24 and before you figure out what the
61:27 solution is you have this horrible
61:28 feeling of like dammit I can't figure
61:31 this out am i dumb whatever and then the
61:33 second and you could cheat you could go
61:34 in the back of the book and look up the
61:35 answer and every time you do go in the
61:38 back of the book and look up the answer
61:40 you you maintain that negative feeling
61:42 that you're cheated but the second you
61:44 figure it out the second that you take
61:46 Elda and you do something and you figure
61:48 it out oh my god that amazing feeling
61:52 that you accomplished something
61:54 that truth of the moment you figured out
61:56 the puzzle only truth would solve a
61:59 puzzle you feel amazing don't you all
62:04 right a lot of us are being becoming
62:08 very Gnostic we're becoming very plugged
62:10 into the universe we are feeling truth
62:12 before we can even put it into words and
62:14 then we do our research and it guides us
62:18 to look at the right stuff and you start
62:21 to feel why you start to notice
62:22 scientifically why what you were told
62:25 didn't work out but the second that
62:29 someone starts telling you BS again I'm
62:32 just gonna lean back on the universe you
62:38 start to get that acidic feeling inside
62:40 your soul don't you it's not true you
62:44 don't know why it's not true you just
62:45 know it's not true you know now there
62:50 are situations and I just had a little
62:54 chat with one of our listeners on the
62:56 side about this and we're both on the
62:59 same page one of the things that can
63:02 happen it's sort of in between which you
63:05 have to be careful as an individual okay
63:08 is that if you've been indoctrinated to
63:10 believe something your entire life and
63:12 you've always sort of had that acidic
63:15 feeling inside your chest that maybe
63:16 it's not all true there's truth in it
63:19 but it's not all true
63:21 you may simply be getting angry because
63:24 you're being challenged and you fought
63:27 very hard your whole life to hang on to
63:29 this thing that may or may not be true
63:31 and you go into a defense stance inside
63:35 your mind and you get angry that someone
63:37 will tell you that something you've
63:38 believed your entire life isn't true
63:41 it's the kubler-ross effects right anger
63:46 denial negotiation and acceptance you
63:49 may just be in the anger phase if you
63:53 chat about it you might be a negotiation
63:55 phase oh come on guys there's so much
63:59 proof this is what happened and you may
64:01 just be saying there's so much proof
64:03 because you never really researched the
64:05 proof could be climate change could be
64:10 Jesus could be the Holocaust
64:13 it could be claims that people are
64:16 really evil and that they would do
64:17 things like 9/11 and you just simply
64:19 don't want to accept that I'll be the
64:22 last person to tell you that you have to
64:23 change your beliefs right now or that
64:25 you have to believe what I believe by
64:27 any means right I just hope that you'll
64:30 take it take a small moment of your life
64:34 to contemplate for a second that maybe
64:37 things that you've been told since
64:39 childhood were told you because it's
64:41 become a routine within society I mean
64:44 if you're over 40 then you're older than
64:46 Wolfe put this way if you were born
64:48 before 2006 then you didn't grow up with
64:51 this global warming crap and so you have
64:54 a chance you have a lot more faculties
64:56 to go this is [ __ ] this isn't true
64:58 come on study sunspots that's when we
65:01 get a lot more discharge from the Sun in
65:03 2003 when Huntington Beach was a hundred
65:06 degrees for nearly three weeks in a row
65:09 it's never been that hot since 2003 I've
65:12 been in this community in this house for
65:15 15 years every single year gets cooler
65:18 and cooler and cooler this this winter
65:20 right now was one of the coolest winters
65:23 we've ever had and just keeps getting
65:25 colder and colder what did I say back in
65:28 season one in 2015 we're headed for a
65:32 mini ice age and there is nothing that
65:34 man's
65:35 do to stop that from happening last time
65:39 it happened was in the 1870s when the
65:40 Thames froze there's paintings of a
65:43 river that hasn't frozen in over a
65:45 hundred years frozen solid and people
65:47 throwing banquets on it having picnics
65:51 on this river as far as I remember the
65:54 history said that I think it froze over
65:56 three years in a row and this summer
65:59 barely felt like summer the England is a
66:02 little bit north so it's going to be
66:04 cooler in general than probably
66:06 California but I was over there in 2000
66:09 roaming around the British Museum and it
66:12 was 93 on the third floor inside it's
66:16 crazy
66:18 apparently priceless artifacts don't
66:21 need air-conditioning it's sort of a
66:24 bummer that we have to do this right
66:25 it's sort of a bummer that we have to
66:28 you know defend our brains it sucks
66:31 right and you know before the internet
66:35 it was a lot easier to have localized
66:38 cultural beliefs you didn't have news
66:41 coming in from around the world that
66:43 something horrible happened and you
66:46 could just be in your own little
66:47 community but today the world got a lot
66:50 smaller doesn't it with the Internet you
66:52 hear a bunch of crap you don't need to
66:53 hear and you hear some stuff that you're
66:55 very interested in and it's sort of this
67:00 love it and hate it situation right
67:02 you're getting your brain totally
67:03 expanded to all kinds of theories like
67:05 electrical universe and all kinds of
67:08 neat things and with every morsel of
67:13 goodness that comes in you have at least
67:16 one that's negative maybe two you have
67:19 to fend off all this stuff figure out
67:21 how you're gonna store all this stuff in
67:22 your brain we're very fortunate to be in
67:26 this time where we can wake up but like
67:29 I've said a couple times on the show
67:30 they are coming after every single
67:32 mechanism to spread information we know
67:35 censorship is off the chain in March of
67:39 2018 we've seen YouTube channels get
67:43 taken down YouTube channels BD monetized
67:45 we've seen it censorship
67:48 the very fundamental of human freedom is
67:52 being compromised by corporations that
67:54 enjoy a free world to build their
67:59 corporations inside of and the last
68:02 closing thing I want to say is on this
68:04 particular episode is it it is we have
68:07 to we have to have some skin in the game
68:08 it's really what I want to say we have
68:10 to start spreading fundamental things
68:14 right in my lifetime I I haven't seen so
68:22 many people sort of divorce their
68:24 political alliance as I have in this day
68:27 and age you know if you're looking at us
68:30 from Europe you're thinking that you
68:34 know America is going right-wing it's
68:36 not really the case what's really going
68:38 on is we're going centralist we're right
68:40 in the center there's things from the
68:41 left that we like there's things from
68:43 the right that we like and we're trying
68:45 to figure out the right balance in
68:46 between of course anytime you disagree
68:49 with various sides they accuse you being
68:52 a part of the other side okay and there
68:56 definitely are extremist groups that are
68:58 extremely one side or the other but
69:02 there's a lot of falsehoods about what's
69:03 actually happening in that as well right
69:05 if you're in Europe I think that you
69:09 think that we have KKK rallies all over
69:11 the south every single day okay I
69:14 haven't seen any form of a KKK rally
69:18 since I was a child and it was on TV and
69:21 when I saw it we all sat in a room going
69:23 and I was in the Midwest you know it's
69:25 not necessary south or north so I got a
69:27 nice and neutral I wasn't near the east
69:29 or west I wasn't during close to the
69:32 north to the south I was directly in the
69:33 center of this country but we looked at
69:36 it and just were appalled that these
69:38 organizations still exist that anyone
69:40 still believes that white supremacy
69:43 stuff they simply don't happen but there
69:47 talked about a lot to galvanize your
69:50 belief one way or the other and if you
69:52 don't have first-hand knowledge about it
69:53 not happening here then you might think
69:56 it happens all the time we know that
69:57 there are what Nazi rallies in Germany
70:01 everyone
70:01 once in a while but no one thinks
70:03 Germany has a bunch of you know youth
70:05 dressed up in swastikas we don't think
70:07 that over here this is important you
70:09 don't think that about us either right
70:12 we just need to spread the repercussions
70:16 of not having freedom of speech go back
70:20 in history every person that's demonized
70:22 today was exactly that kind of person no
70:26 free speech the Second Amendment the
70:30 right to bear arms to protect yourself
70:32 against the government that is coming
70:34 after your rights that's why that law
70:37 was created that bill of right the
70:40 Second Amendment of the United States
70:42 Constitution it's not for hunting okay
70:46 and again it's a quiet world as long as
70:49 the government doesn't try to rise up
70:51 against you but when your government
70:53 orchestrates or at least the deep state
70:55 orchestrates these horrible things to
70:57 try and take away that right then the
71:00 war is on for our brains right so do
71:05 what you can to find the people in your
71:08 life they're sort of sitting on the
71:09 fence and try to figure out with what
71:12 you know about them and the successful
71:14 conversations you've had and use what
71:15 they say to you to go to the next
71:17 subject matter well that's funny you
71:19 mentioned that because have you noticed
71:21 this this and this I don't think we
71:23 really want that do we I mean you know I
71:25 don't want to shoot anybody with the gun
71:27 either I don't want to have to fight a
71:28 revolution but if we let all of our
71:31 rights go away then a revolution is the
71:33 only thing that becomes apparent that's
71:35 the only way to get back those rights
71:38 for anyone who's gained a lot of weight
71:40 in your lifetime you'll know what it's
71:43 like to try and lose all that weight and
71:45 get back to your ideal weight when you
71:47 were in high school or whenever you last
71:48 look the way you wanted to look it could
71:52 be so overwhelming your addictions are
71:55 to eat food that you're not supposed to
71:56 eat so in one way you've either been
71:59 indoctrinated or even doctrine ated
72:00 yourself to eat a bunch of stuff that's
72:02 going to compromise your health to get
72:05 back to your ideal weight it can seem
72:07 insurmountable it can seem impossible
72:10 and that's what's going to happen if we
72:15 our rights in this world we're going to
72:19 not be able to get it back in our
72:21 lifetime and then you're gonna look at
72:23 your kids that are being vaccinated to
72:25 the point they can't pay attention in
72:27 class their all their dopamine triggers
72:30 are all screwed up because they look at
72:32 cellphones every two seconds to get that
72:34 little drop right we're all guilty of
72:37 this a little bit right but to get back
72:42 to that freedom it it could be damn near
72:45 impossible with the technology that we
72:47 have today because they can drone us to
72:50 death or they can do whatever they can
72:52 continue legislating our beliefs believe
72:55 me if they could just walk into the
72:57 house and the Senate and the United
72:59 States of America with some you know
73:03 belief system Patriot Act and get it
73:07 passed to make everything illegal that
73:11 challenges their FOA for 'ti they would
73:14 do that in a heartbeat but they don't
73:17 try it because they know were to awake
73:19 at this point but if they censor us to
73:22 the point we can no longer spread the
73:23 information and all this awakening
73:25 that's going on starts to shrink like a
73:27 little molecule then it goes with the
73:29 wind it'll be over for a very long time
73:34 I think you feel me I just wanted to
73:39 chew this up a little bit I want to come
73:40 at it from different angles let me give
73:43 you this homework in the comments
73:44 section anytime that you've succeeded in
73:49 spreading information I don't worry
73:52 about the big subjects small little
73:56 inroads that you've made on a friend or
73:59 a family member or your kids where
74:02 you've seen some success up and you
74:03 shared a little thing and it just got
74:06 everyone awake right give you an example
74:09 of my end my co-host in the old show
74:12 MKULTRA radio I called him up in 2007
74:17 late 2007 and I told him what I had
74:21 discovered over the last three or four
74:23 years about 9/11 about banking
74:26 institutions about the world
74:28 and he he sort of laughed in my face on
74:32 the phone and said oh my god you just
74:33 can't deal with the fact that they're
74:35 bad things happen in the world and that
74:38 there are bad people out there and so
74:40 you're creating all these conspiracies
74:41 to make it all make sense like no dude
74:44 it's not like that at all so he and I
74:47 have never had a disagreement before
74:49 I've known each other since 89 really
74:53 good friends and I hadn't so I hang up
74:55 the phone I'm just like that's kind of
74:57 weird it was a weirdest conversation I
74:58 had with Kyle he called me in July
75:01 fourth or so of 2008 and I'm literally
75:05 in Kansas I'm visiting my family and I
75:08 pick up the phone it's him
75:10 it's really tonight for me is by about
75:12 eight o'clock six o'clock is time and I
75:14 answered the phone I go hey what's up
75:15 dude and he said he said you were right
75:20 I said what are you talking about and he
75:24 goes I'm finally awake because I have
75:26 seen what is what I cannot unsee and he
75:31 had seen zeitgeist the movie the first
75:33 one by Joseph it was a Peter Joseph
75:38 something that and that was what he
75:42 needed to see to wake him up and then he
75:45 became angry and he took that anger and
75:48 the energy and went and researched more
75:50 and more and more and then he came to me
75:53 to start MK ULTRA radio because he had
75:56 this in road into a radio station that's
75:59 a rare you know
76:01 sledgehammer that he found but maybe you
76:05 have ones that are a lot simpler so
76:08 please share those experiences in the
76:10 comments because I think we could all
76:12 learn something again if you want to
76:13 have a great experience on this channel
76:15 if you're coming in through podcasts I
76:17 would suggest do whatever you can to get
76:20 over to the YouTube channel and just
76:22 start reading some of the comments the
76:24 the information that there's two kinds
76:27 of information that I loved seeing in
76:29 the comments let me just say thank you
76:31 to everyone he does this one the generic
76:34 post of someone saying I've had this
76:37 experience that relates to this episode
76:39 and you share your own personal journey
76:41 with this stuff from
76:42 hosts to spirits to knowledge to science
76:46 it is the most fascinating reading for
76:49 me personally but I can get my hands on
76:51 my house is full of all kinds of amazing
76:52 books the other theme it's more rare
76:57 that I see our people from Europe who
77:00 listen to the show that either confirm
77:02 or deny what I'm saying on the show in
77:05 terms of yeah we're having that
77:06 experience or it's not quite like what
77:08 you think it's more like this and
77:09 sometimes it's more intense than I ever
77:11 thought it was going to be and sometimes
77:12 I'm just flat-out wrong
77:14 so those contributions giving us a
77:16 bird's-eye view of what Germany looks
77:18 like Norway is Switzerland and all these
77:20 different people that watch the show
77:21 it's it's fantastic so for those of you
77:26 listen overseas thank you so much please
77:29 do what you can to help us be
77:30 enlightened as to what kind of the the
77:32 feeling is over there right now would be
77:35 pretty valuable to know what people
77:37 think about the EU over there
77:39 my business partners are travel over
77:41 there a lot and come back some of which
77:43 again can pass for non-american so they
77:46 go over there and they hear no one's
77:48 protecting their opinions about what
77:50 they're saying about America and so we
77:52 got all these interesting stories about
77:54 what they think about us which is just
77:56 you know I don't really challenge
78:00 anything they say at all I just sit
78:01 there of my you know my chin on my fist
78:05 just listening going oh my god this is
78:07 great so anyway you can contribute it'd
