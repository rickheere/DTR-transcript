00:35 welcome back to D thoughts ladies and
00:37 gentlemen this is gonna be the second
00:40 version of this same exact show I've
00:43 recorded because my audio on the first
00:45 version was all fuzzy so I would talk
00:47 and it sounded like someone's ruffling
00:49 papers on top of me which was really
00:52 strange so I got a new computer and I'm
00:56 using audition from Adobe suite so we'll
01:00 see if this think acts on a really long
01:03 recording I gave it a good 45 minute
01:06 test last night it seemed to work just
01:07 fine so hopefully this is going well
01:11 today's episode is about something I'm
01:14 calling consensus reality and it dawned
01:18 on me through the previous episode that
01:23 you know we're all it's it's interesting
01:25 because there's a lot of folks trying to
01:27 study the shape of the earth right and
01:31 part of its just led by the fact that we
01:33 have a space agency that is notorious
01:36 for lying through their teeth about
01:38 accomplishments in order to advance an
01:41 agenda from the sixties where you know
01:43 it was like a Cold War battle most of us
01:48 kids born in that era the tail end of
01:51 that era are bored to death of it you
01:53 know get over your ruski hating [ __ ]
01:57 and let's move on with life and let's
01:59 let's admit what we've done and what we
02:02 haven't done so we can really do what we
02:03 need to do so what would consensus
02:06 reality beat well I'm not the first
02:08 person to see justice by any stretch of
02:10 the means you know we have
02:15 we all have consciousness and this is
02:19 something that science absolutely
02:21 struggles with you know they'll just
02:24 blatantly say to you they know exactly
02:25 what it is and they've got nothing
02:29 really but egos prevail most the time
02:34 right and society who operates pretty
02:38 much in a blissful ignorance which is
02:40 not a bad thing well we'll open up a
02:44 door and kind of look in a direction
02:45 well how did the universe start and and
02:48 some blowhard says what a big bang man
02:53 well how do you know that well I read it
02:55 once man it was on TV and you know TV
02:58 doesn't lie
02:59 and so we get these ridiculous fairy
03:03 tales that help the blissfully ignorant
03:07 explain what they can't explain and then
03:09 they feel more secure that the mystery
03:11 of life has been explained right the
03:15 problem is is that doesn't have any
03:17 scientific method attached to it and he
03:19 do diligence any scrutiny and so you
03:27 need that in order to really assure
03:29 yourself that your honor on the right
03:31 track but what if the reality that you
03:37 and I live in is merely a set of
03:42 realizations inventions decisions to
03:45 acknowledge what we see today that
03:52 started way back before we had any
03:54 semblance of a universe we conceived of
04:01 the fabric that would create a reality
04:03 and therefore it exists who knows if we
04:07 have to exert effort to make it here
04:09 make it exist right we're not
04:11 necessarily thinking about every single
04:13 ether particle in the universe maybe
04:17 we've set aside a bunch of us to do that
04:19 and then a bunch of us get to play
04:21 inside the facility you know sort of
04:24 like a West world analogy of
04:26 you know thousands of people that build
04:28 that place hold it together and then a
04:30 bunch of guests get to go inside which
04:32 number in the hundreds while tens of
04:36 thousands are working on the outside
04:38 somewhere could be played out for The
04:40 Truman Show but there's a few
04:42 interesting things and I'm going to
04:43 romanticize a few things that we I think
04:46 we know on this show are different than
04:49 what I'm going to suggest but it's just
04:51 just let your mind kind of feel this out
04:53 a little bit now there's a lot of us
04:56 that think that the Space Station
04:57 footage especially the ISS footage is
05:00 fake we see slip up after slip up where
05:06 you know they'll be looking at a monitor
05:08 in HQ the Russians made this mistake
05:12 they were doing spacewalks and then they
05:14 said oh my god we have to figure out how
05:16 to how to save the astronauts in space
05:19 and they said they had a live feed from
05:21 their space station and it was a guy in
05:25 underwater and you saw these bubbles
05:27 coming up and so the thing with the ISS
05:32 is that they've never taken a single
05:34 video shot to my knowledge of the Moon
05:37 which should be the most glorious ball
05:39 in the sky you've ever seen they build
05:42 their space station such that the only
05:44 opening is directly on earth and never
05:46 an opening back the other way but it
05:48 wouldn't matter during a spacewalk all I
05:50 have to do is turn their head to the to
05:52 the moon the other thing is that they
05:55 don't believe they've ever filmed the
05:57 Sun either and what's interesting about
05:59 that is that the ISS is always filming
06:02 the earth when it's lit which means the
06:03 Sun should be directly behind the space
06:06 station now digital cameras back when
06:09 they first came out would burn out if
06:11 you looked at the Sun if you point them
06:13 at the Sun the sensor inside the camera
06:15 being magnified like a like a magnifying
06:20 glass that starts a fire in your leg
06:21 it would just fry the inside of the
06:23 camera but they have advanced cameras to
06:26 the point where you can definitely do a
06:28 brief you know exposure to the Sun you
06:30 won't burn out the camera by quite a
06:32 quite a bit of exposure but you never
06:35 see that
06:36 but now the interesting thing is that we
06:39 have these shots from space where we
06:41 don't have any stars and of course they
06:44 always blame the aperture of the cameras
06:45 which okay let's just say 98% of the
06:48 time you have to keep the aperture
06:49 adjusted for filming local objects which
06:52 are very bright and the Sun that's very
06:54 bright so you have to crank it all the
06:55 way down and and let's just say that
06:57 most stars disappear now you still have
06:59 to explain well the Milky Way is
07:02 invisible because it's a blanket in
07:04 space right without the atmosphere
07:06 distorting light that thing should be
07:08 literally a tapestry that's it's
07:10 immutable okay with stars you have stars
07:17 like Sirius which you know and I took
07:20 astronomy they always said it was
07:21 slightly brighter than the moon it puts
07:24 out more lumens than the moon okay you
07:27 have the Polaris North Star you've got a
07:29 few stars out there that are very bright
07:31 it plus you have Venus that should be
07:34 very very bright at various times of the
07:37 year so there's some stars that should
07:40 penetrate even the tightest aperture you
07:43 know aside from filming you know thrill
07:45 Sun winds so why am I going on and on
07:48 about the ISS when this is something
07:50 about consensus reality well imagine if
07:56 stars are not visible because they don't
07:59 exist
08:01 because man can't really imagine that
08:04 much content at once and so we have
08:07 imagined this blue marble or this dish
08:13 or this whatever and we can't conceive
08:20 of really all the stars that are out
08:22 there but we can't conceive of a
08:23 tapestry against a blanket that maybe we
08:29 can drive through it maybe we can get on
08:31 the other side of it it doesn't have to
08:35 make sense once we imagine it
08:38 and that's the key there's folks that
08:42 can see through the moon and there's a
08:44 star that or even Venus appears to go
08:48 through the moon there's photographs of
08:51 this I haven't personally seen this I'll
08:53 let you know if I ever see it but we've
08:55 seen photographs that go through and
08:57 again it could be complete hoax by
08:59 somebody I wouldn't put it past anyone
09:01 on the internet to do that there's folks
09:04 trying to do experiments to figure out
09:05 the earth is flat if it's around and
09:07 what's really strange about it is is
09:09 that the Flat Earth physical models that
09:11 we see from the ancient history even
09:14 illustrations make the North Pole a big
09:19 bump and then it goes down it goes up on
09:21 the edge but no one seems to give a [ __ ]
09:23 about that model when they're looking at
09:25 this Flat Earth thing again there's
09:27 there's been a video out there I think
09:30 it's my globe Busters that are no sorry
09:34 uh I forgot what they call themselves
09:37 it's like fly earth busters or something
09:39 like that and I think that they have
09:42 absolutely destroyed the Flat Earth
09:46 theory with the direction in which the
09:48 Sun travels during the day it goes the
09:51 complete opposite polarity or
09:53 directional polarity that it should if
09:56 it's a disc so I think if you want to
09:59 fight the fact that you think it's a
10:00 globe that's fine but a disc is not the
10:04 shape because the Sun shows up in the
10:08 south east and sets in the southwest and
10:10 that's the exact opposite that it would
10:12 travel during the day plus it goes you
10:16 know high north in the mid of the
10:17 afternoon and goes back down so that
10:19 that shape is the wrong shape should be
10:21 inverted
10:25 but I said in my existential
10:28 existentialism episode in season 2 that
10:32 what if the greatest secret in the world
10:34 is that we control our environment
10:39 now the secret and what the bleep do we
10:41 know our two attempts by individuals to
10:46 teach you that you do control your
10:47 reality and some of it is on some
10:50 existential you pick your next second
10:52 reality and you're actually controlling
10:53 the universe and the other side of the
10:56 game is neural peptides which are sort
10:59 of stem-cell peptides that you can
11:02 imagine what you want to be physically
11:06 as well as mentally I guess you could
11:08 say and these peptides will transform
11:10 into whatever image you have of yourself
11:14 so if you think of yourself as heavy
11:16 these things will transform into that
11:18 and make you fat if you think yourself
11:20 as a rock star it'll just rip you out
11:23 and you get dark rock-hard abs and all
11:25 that kind of stuff right and that's
11:29 that's a medical reality then you
11:32 studied a Lamarck who invented all of
11:36 the theories of evolution that darwin
11:40 ripped off after the Battle of Waterloo
11:41 and he talked about epigenetics which
11:46 Darwin couldn't understand which is why
11:47 it took another two hundred years for us
11:49 to get that information into the public
11:51 eye what de la Marck figured out in the
11:54 late 1700s was that we are an electrical
11:57 object human construct is electrical and
12:00 that when we think we create electrical
12:03 patterns that they communicate with the
12:06 membranes of our cells which then
12:08 communicate with the interiors of
12:10 ourselves and thus evolve ourselves
12:13 during our own lifetime now I want to
12:16 reflect on the fact that the overall
12:18 theme of reality today is that the
12:24 people who are atheists and grumpy
12:27 atheists I should say I should say is
12:29 that they believe that
12:32 we are built in a world where we have no
12:34 control right babies die
12:37 people get sick now again in a world
12:41 where we reincarnate all of that torment
12:44 doesn't really matter right it's just a
12:50 cycle we just renew when you die in a
12:52 video game and you're immediately
12:54 resurrected you don't give a [ __ ] that
12:56 you died really I mean you know loot you
12:58 lose 10% of your endurance on your armor
13:01 and all that kind of stuff but overall
13:02 you're fine right but if you just simply
13:06 look at epigenetics we have control over
13:11 who we are for any of you who've had
13:15 premonitions where you felt like not
13:16 only did you start seeing the future the
13:19 immediate future but that you could
13:20 control where you ended up in that
13:22 immediate future you will realize that
13:26 there's a lot more control for any of
13:28 you who believe in law of attraction or
13:33 just when you're about to crash and burn
13:36 however that's defined emotionally
13:38 financially whatever and somebody comes
13:41 by and saves your ass it always seems to
13:44 occur well then you've noticed that the
13:47 universe has a few fail-safes that will
13:50 keep you eating and keep you sheltered
13:53 so we have I think a preponderance of
13:56 evidence that we have control over this
13:59 universe tiny tiny things and the only
14:03 difference between you believing in this
14:05 control and experiencing the control and
14:07 the beauty of that control is your
14:09 belief that you can for anyone who's
14:13 really benefited from law of attraction
14:15 you will roll your eyes when someone
14:18 tells you it's deterministic but you
14:20 have no choice and it's all written in a
14:22 book of bla bla bla
14:24 by God you know I guarantee you God
14:26 having it all figured out if you're an
14:29 omnipotent creator of this universe and
14:32 you've got it all figured out there's no
14:34 reason for you to exist there's no
14:35 reason for any of us to exist either
14:37 well what do you do you're just
14:39 basically looking at a creation and
14:41 you're just looking at it at a point
14:42 where it's like well I know everything
14:43 about this thing
14:45 there's no mystery there's no result
14:47 there's no surprises you can't be happy
14:50 you can't be upset because it's all
14:53 figured out it's like the minute you
14:56 invent comedy God also it writes every
14:59 joke that could possibly exist
15:02 instantaneously and then it's like what
15:04 he has one big giant laugh and it's over
15:07 because everything is created in an
15:09 absolute completeness we have Mandela
15:12 effects right now the Mandela effect
15:17 could simply be all of us getting a
15:19 bunch of information wrong and the
15:21 Internet's able to sort it out for us
15:22 right it is very strange that interview
15:30 with the vampire interview with a
15:32 vampire you know the author got it wrong
15:37 for a decade she could not remember her
15:40 own books name that's pretty interesting
15:44 James Earl Jones can't remember the real
15:48 line spoken in Empire Strikes Back he
15:50 spends nearly 30 years not only taking
15:55 interviews about he says Luke I'm your
15:56 father and instead of no I'm your father
15:58 and he also recreates it at Star Wars
16:01 conventions Luke I'm your father
16:05 all of us remember it that way a bunch
16:08 of us remember it that way and then all
16:09 sudden it's no I'm your father pretty
16:13 interesting right but what if reality is
16:18 a consensus every single scrap of it is
16:22 a consensus we know the words as ice
16:25 mentioned in a previous episode the word
16:28 dissect or dissect is pronounced dis
16:31 sect that's the real way to say the word
16:33 but we just consensus it into
16:36 retardation and now we say at income
16:39 incorrectly data is really data we have
16:45 rules about how vowels separate are
16:47 separated by consonants create Long's
16:50 and shorts but the more ignorant society
16:52 gets there's a consensus to be ignorant
16:55 where is that headed right
16:58 I mean how many of you have seen a show
17:00 on TV where they're pitching you know
17:02 the sales numbers for a corporation and
17:04 there's a line chart and the line charts
17:08 always supposed to go up because you're
17:10 supposed to generate more money for your
17:11 shareholders nobody wants to bring in
17:14 the lineart line graph that goes down
17:16 but when it comes to the consensus of
17:19 reality that we're willing to live in
17:20 right now it's the stupider the better
17:24 and it's not it it's really stupid it's
17:29 not ignorant it's stupid it's it's
17:31 hearing something that makes no sense at
17:33 all and endorsing it the only I would
17:38 say this if we could undo are the all
17:42 the horrors of the world that we exist
17:46 in today all the 9/11 stuff all these
17:48 terrorist attacks all these false flags
17:50 and crisis actors if we could totally
17:53 undo the knowledge of that and go back
17:55 to the more peaceful sort of world that
18:00 we had say 40 years ago you might find
18:06 me assisting that process to get us back
18:10 to goodness goofiness right
18:14 dancing on Soul Train and lines right
18:16 and that's like it break dancing in the
18:19 80s instead of fighting and shooting and
18:21 stabbing each other yeah you might find
18:23 me help out with that process but what's
18:26 happening today in the ignorance that we
18:28 have breeding into this world which
18:30 affects the consensus all right is that
18:33 we are locking in horrific things and
18:38 we're locking in crappy science you know
18:42 Bill Nye the douchebag guy and Neil
18:45 deGrasse Tyson these two guys are
18:50 looking at the age discrimination curve
18:54 that happens at their age and they found
18:57 a sweet job lie to the public 24/7 and
19:02 make money off of it what do you care
19:06 right it's that old Rockefeller thing
19:08 where they said you know why do you care
19:09 about someone else
19:11 just protect your own protect your
19:13 family and yourself that's all that you
19:16 can possibly affect so screw the rest of
19:18 the world and that of course is spoken
19:24 out of a mind of complete ignorance
19:25 which when playing chess might be able
19:28 to conceive of two moves ahead because
19:31 once this Rockefeller take care of your
19:33 own and [ __ ] everyone else attitude
19:35 becomes the mainstay of a reality you
19:41 create a world that you wouldn't want to
19:43 live in because you dumb down and make
19:46 the rest of the population ignorant and
19:49 that's sort of what's going on in the
19:50 world today right they want to impede
19:53 our education then they want to call us
19:55 cattle or sheep or whatever and they
19:58 make fun of us ok how's that gonna work
20:04 out over the course of a hundred years
20:07 we're back to consensus reality what
20:11 fuels this notion well I think it it's
20:15 fueled by a couple things one
20:17 [Music]
20:19 is the the fact that we have anomalies
20:25 that we can't really understand and
20:27 they're in all corners of the world
20:30 right again from the fabric of reality
20:32 that would say it was this way but not
20:36 this way the Mendell effect to the
20:39 notion that we have seen the fact that
20:41 at times human beings can control things
20:45 again I'm gonna repeat something I said
20:48 in season 1 and 2 which is that and this
20:51 is gonna make some of you roll your eyes
20:52 but stay with me and hopefully
20:54 understand that I'm not gonna throw this
20:56 out there and some pay attention to me
20:57 give me all this attention because I'm
20:59 so fragile
21:00 I need your edification back in the 90s
21:06 when I started working you know
21:09 full-time at I should say a lot at
21:13 Electronic Arts my buddies and I would
21:18 role play Dungeons and Dragons and
21:21 system called champions and we did some
21:24 shadow run too but here I am in this
21:26 room with the best game designers on
21:30 planet earth we have like a bank
21:33 president in there a female bank
21:34 president and another guy who's a big
21:36 designer it's just a pretty intellectual
21:40 people in the room and my buddies were
21:43 able to create storylines that that we
21:46 would crawl into and believe and for
21:48 those of you don't know how this works
21:49 you sit in a room for four to six hours
21:51 pizzas are delivered you have your die
21:54 and you listen to a guy tell you what's
21:59 happening you make choices you roll dice
22:01 to figure out how it works it's the
22:03 crazy die you know the tetrahedron you
22:05 know dice 12 sided die to in sided die
22:08 all that kind of stuff and you figure
22:10 out what your odds are and there is a
22:13 moment it happened to me twice just
22:16 twice where the story got so rich and so
22:20 intense that I was rolling this 20-sided
22:26 die so you have to break down the odds
22:30 I've got a 1 in 20 overall
22:32 a 20 it's got literally 1 through 20 on
22:36 the day if you roll one in dungeons
22:38 dragons you fumble your weapon or you
22:40 have to roll to save your weapon but
22:43 most the time you break your weapon at
22:44 me it's just bad but when you roll a 20
22:49 you get double damage it's the best
22:52 thing you could possibly do my buddy had
22:55 told a story just to recap the very
22:57 first time whatever happened to me our
22:59 party was going through this underground
23:01 tunnel it's like a big giant opening you
23:06 know it's like Cathedral huge and it
23:08 just goes and goes and goes and it's lit
23:09 by a glowing moss and we walked into a
23:12 tavern that had just been ransacked we
23:15 could see that someone had ransacked and
23:17 raped and pillaged everything in this
23:18 place and my character was a wood elf
23:21 and I go inside this room and there's a
23:24 wood elf female on the ground which I
23:26 haven't seen too many wood else in this
23:27 whole journey which lasted six months as
23:30 like six months of playing once a week
23:33 at least
23:35 and this wood elf females on the ground
23:38 and he describes how she was raped and
23:41 murdered it was graphic graphic to the
23:44 absolute maximum of graphic and he did
23:47 such an amazing job that all of us sort
23:50 of felt awful in the room because we're
23:53 adopting this as reality right which is
23:56 the fun of role-playing well it makes
23:58 you a great screenwriter - and so I'm
24:02 pissed I'm really pissed off and we keep
24:04 going down this river that goes down the
24:06 center of this thing it's how we move
24:08 and also we bump into I believe it was
24:11 like some orcs and orcs are in this
24:14 particular gaming system we're pack
24:16 animals they they don't it's just like
24:17 the movie Fifth Element if you kill the
24:19 leader they don't know what to do and
24:21 they tend to surrender and so we come
24:24 around the corner and I'm the big muscle
24:26 in the and the role-playing thing and
24:28 then the group and I see an orc captain
24:34 or whatever sitting in the throne that's
24:35 one of these throws that they carry
24:36 around you know and he's sitting there
24:38 and all of his minions are doing [ __ ]
24:40 raping and pillaging the next location
24:42 but he's just sitting there with a
24:44 Goblet of wine or whatever and I have
24:48 this vision of this girl in my head
24:49 which was told to me in 15 minutes
24:50 earlier whatever and so in my mind it
24:54 was complete certainty that I needed to
24:56 kill this guy so without telling my
24:58 party I start running towards this guy
25:04 you know that the carefree young warrior
25:06 who doesn't understand he could blow the
25:09 whole pooch by screwing by running away
25:12 running away without help right and so I
25:16 just start charging and then the GM the
25:19 DM Dungeon Master guy looks at me and my
25:21 buddy and he's like oh really okay he
25:26 goes roll the hit and so I got this
25:28 20-sided die and I start holding it in
25:34 my hand just like you know you look when
25:35 you roll a die and my mind was so into
25:41 this story that what happened when I was
25:44 rolling this die is that so while I'm
25:49 rolling this die reality starts to wrap
25:56 around me like a sphere and so all of
26:00 the light around me it was like I was
26:02 inside of a crystal ball and everything
26:04 was warped around me in the room it was
26:09 mind-blowing
26:10 and Here I am just chugging on this die
26:12 and then I call it I said this is gonna
26:14 be a 20 boom I throw it on the table
26:16 sure enough it's a 20 my buddy who's the
26:20 dungeon master says okay fine you cut
26:22 this guy in half boom killed the leader
26:25 we swept up the rest of these confused
26:27 orcs and it was over and I got done with
26:32 that role and I realized I'd had this
26:34 transcending experience it's almost in
26:36 my body it was you know turned into pure
26:40 light or something I mean it was strange
26:41 it was not lighter or something but I
26:43 felt like I lost the bond with being
26:46 controlled by the reality in the room
26:48 and I ended up being a player in the
26:51 mechanics of the universe just really
26:56 really strange and so I turned to my
26:57 buddy and I said
26:58 I said dude I just controlled the dice
27:01 and he looks at me having played since
27:04 he was about eight years old and he said
27:05 he says yeah you can do that you can
27:08 control the dye and so I let the game
27:12 finish and then I came back to him and I
27:13 said well what did you mean by that he
27:16 says well if you play long enough you'll
27:17 understand that once the story matures
27:20 to a certain point you can control the
27:23 dye you just can and of course my mind
27:26 is a little blown but I realized that
27:29 you know well the other thing is I
27:31 talked to a friend of mine who back in
27:34 the 60s got a hold of a mind over matter
27:36 kind of book just like the episode in
27:38 Twilight Zone and he got to a point
27:44 where he said he could control reality
27:45 this book taught you how to control
27:47 reality and he said he got so good at it
27:49 that he got terrified that he was
27:51 responsible for whatever happened and he
27:53 goes at one point he came to a four-way
27:55 intersection and he felt the
27:57 responsibility of controlling all the
27:59 vehicles through the intersection such a
28:00 no one got hurt because four cars went
28:03 right there at the same time with all
28:04 the stop signs and so then you're like
28:06 who the hell goes first right he said it
28:08 freaked him out so you had to condition
28:10 himself away from that level of reality
28:15 so why make this episode what's the big
28:18 deal see just to go on and on about an
28:22 esoteric concept mmm let me take it to
28:25 another level what if as many of us
28:30 suspect man tens of thousands of years
28:35 ago understood all of this because we
28:37 weren't being conditioned away from it
28:38 there weren't evil people running around
28:40 the planet running the goddamn place
28:41 like it is today
28:42 right isn't it amazing that the people
28:46 that run our planet are almost pure
28:49 concentrated [ __ ] evil either through
28:53 being ignorant shills or being
28:55 absolutely intentional [ __ ] starters
28:58 they love their sociopathic psychopathic
29:05 loathing for society because they turned
29:07 out to be a piece of [ __ ] themselves
29:09 they want the whole world to burn
29:10 right but what if they are the ones that
29:15 understand this better than anyone
29:19 then what now there's a psychological
29:23 reality could to consensus reality in
29:25 that you could [ __ ] a bunch of
29:26 people over and over and over again
29:28 again the best form of brainwashing is
29:30 repetition and you can get social
29:33 justice warriors to pop out you know
29:35 where you're like oh don't you hate
29:37 being the disenfranchised
29:39 oh yes and then it's like okay well you
29:41 got to hate everyone who's got their
29:43 [ __ ] together oh that sounds good you
29:46 know because then you don't have to get
29:47 your [ __ ] together right
29:50 you know the being offended world by God
29:56 what's really really funny about the
29:58 being offended world is this an
29:59 unsustainable model of reality right
30:04 what will happen to the social justice
30:06 warriors of the world is that they're
30:07 gonna go smack that up up against a
30:10 society that has absolutely no no
30:17 attribute that matches theirs meaning
30:19 this being offended Society if they were
30:22 to ever get their way which they won't
30:24 but if they did they were gonna go head
30:27 up head up against someone like you know
30:30 the radical Islam's who are going to
30:33 basically slay them it let's be over
30:37 just instantaneously and they'll be gone
30:39 and then we'll go back another [ __ ]
30:41 10,000 years and sociological
30:44 development and then we'll fight our way
30:46 out of that and you know it'll be crazy
30:49 but what if the elite of the world
30:51 understood that to tell you that the
30:57 world is a particular way and I mean you
30:59 know it's the world is a multi-faceted
31:03 multi-dimensional thing of course right
31:06 so imagine they tell you the world's
31:10 round they tell you the world's flat I
31:12 tell you the world is some bizarre thing
31:16 imagine if the stars don't exist because
31:18 we simply can't conceive of them which
31:20 is why most of us don't dream of real
31:22 traveling the stars there's only had a
31:25 couple people who were Trek fans say
31:27 they dreamed being on the enterprise but
31:30 all my buddies that actually made the
31:31 enterprise episodes again I haven't
31:34 talked to every single one of them but a
31:36 good 14 of them after my buddy who's one
31:41 of the head guys there went in and said
31:43 you know have any of you dreamed of
31:45 being in space your whole life and they
31:48 all said no he's like holy [ __ ] this is
31:52 wild how is it that we imagine reality
31:56 but we can't seem to imagine it when we
31:59 go to bed and then at that stage imagine
32:04 this and this is what I don't understand
32:06 again I'm playing tongue-in-cheek just a
32:08 little bit but imagine if NASA traveling
32:13 in low orbit gets up there and realizes
32:16 it's a blank canvas up there it's almost
32:18 disturbingly black right and there's
32:20 there's electrical cosmologists that say
32:22 you can't see the stars because it
32:24 doesn't bounce through the atmosphere I
32:25 kind of find that to be potentially true
32:28 but guess what I have liquid inside my
32:31 eyeballs they behave like an atmosphere
32:33 it should be that when photons bounce
32:35 aside my eyeball it's a physical reality
32:38 that it disturbs the rods and cones in
32:41 my eyes and gives me sight of the star
32:44 the fact that I need somehow it's you
32:46 you know bounce through and refract
32:49 through an atmosphere for me to see
32:50 seems like a bunch of [ __ ] right
32:53 staring at the goddamn Sun in space
32:55 should be blinding right
33:01 well let's just say they get up there
33:02 and there's nothing they go down below
33:05 and they're stars and there's a moon and
33:07 the Sun they don't even understand where
33:08 the hell it comes from they're like well
33:09 it's there then when we go over this
33:11 atmosphere we don't need we don't see it
33:13 anymore but it's there and somehow the
33:15 the earth is lit right but for whatever
33:20 reason we can't see it when we're up
33:23 there and so NASA thinks to themselves
33:27 well geez
33:28 what is this reality and someone
33:30 whispers to them well it's it's because
33:32 we we are conceiving of reality and we
33:34 can't conceive of stars I mean we can
33:37 put them in a nice new pattern up there
33:40 but we can't really envision Mars Venus
33:48 we can conceive of a few planets but
33:53 maybe NASA is an organization it's
33:55 turned into an organization that says
33:57 dream dream humans dream think of
34:00 something bigger and all the Star Trek
34:02 episodes have this really hidden subtext
34:06 of dream about planets dream about stuff
34:09 every sci-fi thing that space travels
34:11 dream of this reality people so we can
34:14 get off this planet and have a good time
34:18 you know the religious people want to
34:20 believe that Earth is at the center of
34:21 the universe well that's kind of cool
34:23 maybe it's only at the center of the
34:25 universe because we are the only thing
34:27 that he has created reality now for
34:31 those of us who want to grow out of our
34:32 narcissistic attentions of being the
34:35 Supreme Being in the universe and we
34:36 want to dumb ourselves down to poor
34:38 humans and there's all these better
34:40 aliens out there I understand why they
34:42 fight that but maybe in the end we're it
34:47 we also want to believe that there's a
34:49 Supreme Being and I guess the best way
34:53 to think about a Supreme Being in my
34:54 opinion is to think that we don't really
34:59 consciously maybe we don't need to
35:00 consciously think about it but we have a
35:02 whole universe around us right and it
35:06 works perfect like I always say I don't
35:08 want to repeat myself too much but they
35:10 could bought it
35:12 those of you who are very in tune with
35:15 lies and you could just feel you don't
35:18 know the truth necessarily all the time
35:20 but you can just feel a goddamn lie it's
35:22 like this book is wrong this person is
35:25 wrong it doesn't mean they're trying to
35:27 manipulate you in any way shape or form
35:29 it just means they've heard something
35:30 that was erroneous or they've just had a
35:32 bad hunch and for whatever reason
35:34 they're not as in touch with what is
35:36 true and what is false and so they end
35:41 up repeating lies are repeating an
35:44 untruth they're trying to find the truth
35:46 right but think about how we are being
35:50 infiltrated on a daily basis with our
35:53 operating systems on our computers on
35:55 our telephones on our TVs they are
35:58 trying to crawl into every nook and
36:00 cranny of our brain right now
36:03 Apple Apple releases one version of
36:06 their OS after another and I tell you
36:08 what they always say they've got you
36:10 know 200 features or whatever [ __ ]
36:12 lie they've got but most of them
36:15 two-thirds of them three-fourths of
36:17 those new features all have to do with
36:18 social media notifications betting
36:21 everything and everything right you
36:23 can't use your computer to write a
36:25 letter without worrying about where
36:26 they're not gonna share the goddamn
36:27 letter over twitter you know something
36:30 that's impossible
36:31 but they've got it everywhere embedded
36:33 everywhere it's all over your phones
36:34 Android iOS whatever you turn on your TV
36:40 and it's just you know the Supreme
36:41 Commander of applications of social
36:45 media discourse being shoved at you
36:47 right what are the apps on your TV
36:51 you're trying to push you into being
36:54 conditioned 24/7 all right you have to
37:00 make the decision of whether or not you
37:02 want that to be the case but so on this
37:04 fundamental level we have programming
37:09 that goes on all day and we know it and
37:11 no big deal I get programmed as what you
37:13 think okay then you have to make the
37:17 decision of whether or not you want to
37:18 be programmed if we are beings that
37:22 lived forever in a universe of any kind
37:25 of vacuum
37:26 a vacuum of mass energy let's just say
37:29 and we just keep going and keep going we
37:32 have some we have to have a medium by
37:34 which we can discuss things if we're
37:36 living in a vacuum of nothing what could
37:38 you possibly discuss how could you
37:41 communicate okay maybe you're living in
37:43 pure love
37:44 maybe that's pretty awesome but in the
37:46 end if you don't go to the park or
37:50 amusement park or have children or
37:52 whatever yeah what can you talk about
37:54 after a while you don't have anything
37:56 you know the fifties diner to go to and
37:58 say oh my god my eggs were overcooked
38:00 you have nothing and so out of an
38:02 imperative we must create a universe we
38:05 just have to if we're gonna you know I
38:09 don't know if insanity exists if there's
38:10 nothing out there but it'd just be
38:12 boring as hell how we get started what
38:16 the fabric of the universe would be well
38:18 it could be utterly arbitrary you know I
38:22 got a friend of mine who made a computer
38:23 out of carbohydrates well who would have
38:26 ever conceived of that unless you're a
38:28 genius like he was right so you can make
38:32 anything out anything as long as you can
38:34 conceive of the bits and pieces that do
38:37 the job right so for those of you
38:42 looking at the shape of the world huh
38:45 what if it's not any shape right what if
38:49 it's just a bunch of dream conceptions
38:51 in your mind so let's think about for a
38:54 second and this is the way I like to
38:58 encourage you guys to think about the
39:00 universe because let me review with you
39:04 I think the traditional methodology that
39:06 you are instinctively taught to decipher
39:09 the universe and then let me give you a
39:11 different perspective if this is
39:13 different to you should be valuable to
39:15 you it's the following you were taught
39:21 that the universe is much bigger than
39:22 you and that you are sort of like
39:25 Douglas Adams said in the total
39:27 perspective vortex you are infinitely
39:29 small an infinitely small dot on an
39:32 infinitely small dot infinitely small
39:35 insignificant you lack the very physical
39:39 and mental cave
39:40 ability of deciphering this reality
39:45 because just look at the universe look
39:47 how huge it is when you look up at the
39:49 Stars you were sowing incapable of
39:51 figuring it out now the other kind of
39:55 side offshoot to that is you can be a
39:58 narcissistic physicist or cosmologists
40:00 and just make [ __ ] up pat yourself on
40:02 the back okay it's not like they all
40:07 have bad intent of course they're trying
40:09 but the problem is with theoretical
40:11 physicists and physicists in general is
40:14 that you have a very left brain total
40:17 lack of right brain regiment of human
40:20 beings that pretend as if they have any
40:22 [ __ ] clue what the right brain does
40:24 right they've never taken ayahuasca
40:25 they've never taken acid and they've
40:30 never seen love as particle right and
40:34 then you have the rest of us and let me
40:37 give you the alternative theory the
40:40 alternative theory is hey if you created
40:46 the universe wouldn't you leave behind
40:47 some clues wouldn't a neat puzzle be
40:52 you're stuck in this reality until you
40:55 finally decipher what this reality is
40:58 and you're guaranteed by the writer
41:02 which might be you or a bunch of people
41:04 like you you were guaranteed to have all
41:07 of the clues available to you you just
41:09 need to know that this is a game of
41:11 figuring that out if no one tells you
41:14 it's a game and then you just sort of
41:16 live life and it's just functional get
41:19 up make money go to bed get up make
41:21 money go to bed and you die nothing
41:23 interesting happens but the second that
41:27 you say okay well you know what I am
41:29 interested in how this world's put
41:30 together it seems to own me and I don't
41:33 like that maybe you do like it but you
41:36 want to have a little bit more
41:37 interaction you like a mystery I want
41:41 you to realize that it might just be
41:43 that you have a hundred percent of the
41:48 clues now based on your academic
41:51 background
41:53 you may be ready for some clues in fact
41:56 I think it's probably a split between
41:57 the two I wouldn't worry about you know
42:00 aerospace knowledge and you know
42:03 SuperDuper physics and do various
42:06 divisions of you know QED stuff you
42:10 might be that a child is only capable of
42:13 seeing certain clues because they're not
42:15 indoctrinated yet away from that truth
42:18 and so the more childlike you remain and
42:22 the more open-minded you remain you
42:23 might end up being the most
42:25 knowledgeable about the universe but I
42:29 want you to approach it from the
42:30 standpoint that you are soul in this
42:33 universe and you are merely observing it
42:37 as a participant in its creation you
42:42 could view it from a perspective of your
42:43 God and you need to do something about
42:46 this vacuum and space vacuum of purpose
42:49 or view yourself as one of many like you
42:52 that is sitting in the void and it's
42:56 it's up to you to figure out how you're
42:57 gonna run the day right well you know we
43:01 should probably create something you
43:02 want to make a game yeah sure well what
43:05 do you think and then you create
43:06 Parcheesi a couple times and some hearts
43:09 spades at poker and blackjack and then
43:11 you're kind of like Jesus this this this
43:14 numeric thing is pretty cool it's pretty
43:15 fun but how about it let's let's figure
43:19 out a different way to exist and someone
43:21 goes yeah awesome what do you mean well
43:24 I have the defeated this idea called
43:25 touch what is that I don't know let me
43:27 try this out UK hop inside this little
43:30 robot that I call human and I'll jump in
43:33 mind and then I'll touch you okay great
43:36 you jump inside and they touch oh my god
43:39 what a wild sensation they grab you down
43:42 by the little jubblies down below and
43:43 you're like hoo hoo boy I love that
43:45 thing and he says yeah right isn't that
43:47 awesome I made that myself last night
43:49 well you must have stayed up forever
43:50 yep what is day I don't know we're in
43:53 heaven ok but in the end we end up
43:58 creating this fabric of the universe and
44:01 what's really funny about it is that you
44:03 have these esoteric concepts like
44:05 numbers right
44:07 numbers are pretty interesting they go
44:08 up forever they go down forever they
44:10 divide forever they multiply forever
44:12 sort of a wild construct that exists in
44:15 our brains in which we have a hard time
44:17 conceiving well if you think about the
44:20 universe all it is in it is in a utter
44:22 physical extension of the numbering
44:24 system you know Earth's small Sun large
44:29 lots of grains of sand lots of stars in
44:32 this guy you know what do we built out
44:34 of trillions of cells and you know
44:37 beyond that trillions times trillions of
44:40 particles of information because we have
44:43 access to a database we believe that
44:45 time exists because we can see the
44:48 before middle and end of something right
44:51 there is a means to consensus reality
44:54 there is we have arbitrarily potentially
44:59 decided how the universe is put together
45:02 and let's in closing here let's that
45:07 spend about 10 minutes on love right so
45:14 what is it that every single human being
45:17 goes for and this is what's really
45:21 fascinating the common denominator
45:23 experience is love it doesn't mean if it
45:27 doesn't matter if you're you know a
45:30 total [ __ ] elitist you love being an
45:34 elitist you love your tiny penis and
45:37 your total control over the world you
45:41 love it you love getting back at society
45:44 because when you were little you were
45:46 awkward and you're now gonna punish the
45:48 world for it I mean that's the most
45:52 extreme that we would say they have no
45:54 love in their heart they're godless
45:55 people who would disagree with you but
45:58 in the end the normal human being the
46:00 healthy human being which is probably
46:02 99% of the universe or at least you know
46:04 all right when I say universe I mean
46:06 earth were going through the normal ups
46:10 and downs of love you have your
46:12 interpersonal relationships that are
46:15 your family sector and you have love
46:17 there you have love with your spouse
46:18 with your children with your
46:20 family members before that you have your
46:22 love within yourself can you dig looking
46:24 in the mirror you're not perfect but you
46:26 know you know you're working on it and
46:29 then you have your your job what are you
46:33 doing to live so there's that as well
46:38 love is in there because it provides a
46:40 bunch of feedback which is you know on
46:44 one level love is a feedback of your own
46:46 evaluation of things of yourself of your
46:49 family of how you well you've done and
46:50 then love turns into purpose which is
46:52 your drive while you exist but isn't it
46:58 interesting that it's the one unifying
47:00 factor about this entire world a lot of
47:05 folks will say god is love and love is
47:07 God well it's a different way of saying
47:10 the universe is love and love is the
47:13 universe so with that knowledge in mind
47:19 again why do you turn on a television
47:21 show because you love it or you want to
47:24 love it you're trying to love it why do
47:25 you go eat at a particular restaurant
47:27 over another restaurant because you like
47:28 this one better than that one why do you
47:32 play a particular song when you're
47:34 driving fast down the highway or
47:35 cruising on a boat in Havasu at 114
47:39 degrees in August because you'll love it
47:41 if you love it all it is your absolute
47:44 unifying force so we have to I mean
47:50 that's just a clue right that's a clue
47:52 to how this universe was created because
47:54 as human beings that's what motivates us
47:56 right same thing goes for every single
48:00 conscious creature that we can look at
48:02 now who knows what plants think you
48:05 don't have any eyes or legs so they're
48:07 supposedly stupid crazy but these are
48:12 the little fabrics of clues that we can
48:13 start pulling the thread out of the
48:15 sweater to get what we need so when
48:18 people say oh my god I cannot believe in
48:20 God because children suffer okay so in
48:27 all other cases in the universe love is
48:30 at the very core of the design principle
48:34 of how every single life-form behaves
48:36 but supposedly one that that whole thing
48:41 came out of nothing right it's the
48:42 Atheist BIGBANG right love just was
48:44 invented at the singularity right
48:46 everything that lives operates off of a
48:49 preference go over to creationism that
48:52 again doesn't have to be Jesus Christ
48:54 than all this other stuff just means
48:56 that a bunch of beings or one being work
48:58 together to create the Rowdy that we
49:00 have it was a driving force you know
49:05 when you make a movie and you write a
49:07 film there's something called a
49:09 controlling idea and it is the overall
49:12 arc of why why tell this story at all
49:14 what's the purpose what's the moral of
49:17 the story that I'm supposed to get out
49:18 of the story you know it could be
49:20 something like good always triumphs over
49:23 evil
49:24 but the story you look at the star in it
49:27 they never say good they never say evil
49:29 there's no god there's no devil in the
49:31 story but in the end that story's about
49:33 good always prevails over evil our crime
49:37 doesn't pay right there is a controlling
49:41 idea to the creation of the universe I
49:43 assure you and I'm gonna say because you
49:47 have consciousness you are or have been
49:51 or are right now a participant in the
49:56 creation of this universe if nothing
49:59 else just like the Bistro and
50:01 Hitchhiker's Guide of the galaxy
50:03 you are an integral part of the computer
50:06 that is performing this program you know
50:10 you think about computers and they have
50:11 all this memory inside it's doing all
50:13 kinds of wild instructions well you're
50:16 one of those people you're a participant
50:18 in this gigantic program so on some view
50:25 and some existential view of the
50:27 universe you can see the proof of the
50:30 proof in the pudding of this particular
50:32 episode's assertion of consensus reality
50:35 if you could get a bunch of humans to
50:38 move in a particular direction you would
50:41 control the way that this universe is
50:43 perceived I mean what if you could throw
50:45 a party and everybody came
50:47 the whole world came to your party and
50:49 then you played a particular song to
50:51 them or read them a story that everyone
50:53 can understand their little you know
50:55 Babel fish in their ear they get it and
50:59 they all become different they all
51:01 become more peaceful perhaps we see the
51:04 unification of mankind for the first
51:06 time and freaking reality that's
51:09 consensus reality it's not gonna happen
51:11 most likely but you know if you could do
51:15 it if you could fly everybody or
51:16 teleport everyone to a single location
51:19 and you had the best story in the world
51:21 ready for them to hear you would
51:23 definitely create more of a consensus in
51:25 this world you would and it would
51:29 probably be based on a story of loving
51:32 each other I think your homework from
51:35 this episode would be give this some
51:38 thought I want you to study your past
51:44 for those of you with pretty good
51:45 memories of what's happened to you in
51:46 your life
51:47 study your past and see if there's any
51:49 moment when you believe you've
51:51 controlled reality a little bit if not
51:54 it's just absolute think about the times
51:58 when your life was really great and and
52:00 think about your state of mind when life
52:03 was great were you optimistic about the
52:06 world and then life was great it's
52:10 probably not that you were pessimistic
52:11 about the world and life was great that
52:14 probably didn't happen so in one way you
52:16 had a consensus about your reality that
52:18 was positive and stuff just couldn't go
52:21 wrong right you just threw the dart with
52:24 your eyes closed and it was straight
52:25 bull's eye right it's funny that analogy
52:29 I'm gonna share with you I was playing I
52:32 think it's called cricket with darts and
52:36 with this this psychologist and we're
52:41 playing darts and he hit a bull's eye
52:43 just right down the center of this thing
52:45 and I remember having a similar thing
52:48 with the dye that I was going to hit the
52:49 bull's eye as well and I threw my dart
52:51 directly into the back of his dart so
52:54 the pinpoint of my dart went right down
52:56 the center of the barrel of his dart
52:59 splitting it
53:00 I'm left out he just said oh my god he
53:03 pulled it out of the board took it in
53:05 and showed his wife and he said look at
53:07 this man I've also won a lot of contests
53:10 by thinking I was gonna win crazy they
53:12 talk about this all the time I've had it
53:14 happened to me several times so I want
53:16 you to think about in your past when
53:17 this kind of stuff has occurred to you
53:19 then I want you to try to comb your
53:22 reality for clues that you might have
53:27 control over reality at one particular
53:30 time if you could share it in the
53:33 comments to be awesome because there's
53:36 coincidence which we need to separate
53:38 where you felt like the right thing
53:39 occurred to you and I think that's Law
53:41 of Attraction which is another beautiful
53:42 thing you might want to autumn eyes in
53:43 the comments but it's that moment when
53:46 you said it's going to be this way and
53:50 then it was I think that's very valuable
53:54 so I had some some hiccups the computer
53:58 actually locked up at 29 minutes and
54:00 when I played that the audio back it was
54:03 making an absolutely horrible sound I
54:04 have my phone up against the wire that
54:08 goes into the computer so maybe I got a
54:09 text message and that amount of EMF
54:12 waves screwed up the stuff I usually
54:15 keep my phone really far away because
54:16 you know when you get text messages and
54:18 you hear that little sound
54:20 that used to happen on my old computer
54:23 so we'll see if I can't put this
54:25 together the levels are probably all
54:27 over the place I'll try to change that I
54:30 change tracks because they had to
54:32 continue going after about 28 minutes or
54:34 so which after I cut down all the blanks
54:37 all the pauses which shouldn't be too
54:39 many so hopefully this works out deep
54:43 thoughts radio.com for all the feeds
54:45 there's video on YouTube and fit me
54:48 there's audio on iTunes and Google Play
54:50 plus you can just go to the website deep
54:52 thoughts radio calm with your cell phone
54:55 hit the RSS feed icon or the podcast and
54:58 it will lock into whatever podcast radio
55:00 you have on your phone there's a locked
55:02 Facebook group getting a lot of good
55:04 members in there new members that are
55:06 sharing some great stuff again
55:09 I just grant permission for 4 posts to
55:13 go on that page I'm not
55:14 personally controlling you know a
55:17 balanced a fair and balanced thing right
55:19 so if a lot of flatter things come
55:21 through and I grant those don't think I
55:23 personally have some leniency towards
55:26 that I'm cutting out everybody uses the
55:28 other way just just push it in there so
55:32 just know that's how it works but anyway
55:36 take care of yourself with someone else
55:38 and I'll see in the next deep thoughts
