00:33 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:35 deep thoughts this is gonna be a
00:37 Facebook exclusive I'm debating of
00:41 whether or not to do the the index
00:42 episode for the actual season 3 for
00:46 those of you new that would be an
00:47 episode that's just going to give the
00:49 footnotes of all the episodes in season
00:53 3 and sort of my reflection on them I
00:55 did this particular episode during the
00:57 day a few weeks ago and somehow the
01:02 video was lost somewhere in the chain of
01:06 things seen a final cut when you edit
01:08 these things you build up this gigantic
01:10 file on your hard drive and it just
01:13 turned into terabytes and terabytes if
01:15 you don't clean it out sometimes market
01:17 claims it out a little too much so I
01:20 thought you guys might just dig a little
01:22 bit of a review here sorry for it being
01:23 inside the Facebook domain but it's
01:25 going to be uploaded to YouTube and just
01:28 an unlisted link so for those of you
01:30 who've got YouTube access you'll be able
01:32 to get a hold of it so just reflecting
01:35 on the show in general this wasn't
01:37 something that I planned to do I mean I
01:43 even picked the name pretty quick it one
01:45 evening and then now it's the name right
01:47 I think we I think I got the right name
01:51 let's put that way now to review the you
01:54 know the first season is very dynamic
01:57 and strange and all over the place my
02:01 confidence for doing a show all by
02:02 myself was sort of generated only in the
02:05 audio version of em kilcher radio I
02:08 think most of you know the story of that
02:10 particular show I mentioned it every
02:12 once in a while
02:13 but we did about a hundred and thirty
02:15 shows like a hundred normal shows and
02:19 then like 26 plus shows that were real
02:24 or [ __ ] shows so that's just where
02:27 calling I would pick a few funny
02:29 subjects and that's what sort of led
02:31 into deep thoughts in a big way but he
02:35 and I would be talking and sharing you
02:38 know I love doing shows with him if he
02:40 and I live close to each other we would
02:41 have never stopped that show but we
02:45 moved he moved really farther north and
02:47 so now we're 90 minutes apart as I
02:49 always say and so I'm sitting here going
02:52 geez I want to get into these subjects
02:55 really deeply and I just I just needed
02:57 to meander around verbally as you now
03:00 know my art and as I said before you
03:04 know this show was my attempt to say
03:06 things one time and say them well and
03:10 you know that's usually the goal
03:11 sometimes it really happens and I feel
03:14 like I knocked it out of the park and
03:15 other times I'm kind of going if I get a
03:18 bunch it down thumbs or whatever
03:20 criticism on a particular episode I
03:23 totally understand sometimes I'm dealing
03:26 with belief systems and you know it's a
03:30 tough one because you know I've walked
03:33 in a lot of other people's shoes but
03:34 they haven't walked in mine which means
03:37 I've been down their track of belief a
03:39 thousand percent and I managed to learn
03:44 some information put it together connect
03:47 it with all the other stuff I think I
03:49 understand fairly well and I came out of
03:54 it now in the end the true fact is I
03:58 don't really care what anyone believes
04:01 as long as what they believe allows them
04:04 to adhere to common law whether or not
04:06 they understand or know what that is
04:08 which is do no harm to others now season
04:11 one is riddled with me trying to figure
04:13 out what the format was how do I really
04:15 edit these things together the two
04:20 things I ended up changing fairly
04:22 quickly in season one was the editing
04:25 style
04:27 the I used to you clear your throat when
04:32 you talk for a really long time and
04:34 you've just eaten dinner
04:36 you'll or lunch or whatever you'll
04:39 tighten up your chest as you carry a
04:41 really long sentence along you're like
04:43 Ace Ventura and then you'll you know you
04:46 burp every once in a while you know I'll
04:48 have a little moment indigestion because
04:50 again you're not standing up you know
04:52 after you should stand up because your
04:54 body needs gravity to process everything
04:56 luckily we do have a torso that helps
04:58 out a little bit but anyway I was
05:01 leaving all these things in the first
05:03 season
05:03 every time I cleared my throat and they
05:05 never listening to it listen to it in
05:07 the car and I was like ooh that I don't
05:10 want to hear that personally yeah I
05:11 don't wanna hear a bunch of mouth noises
05:12 now sometimes that just happens and
05:15 believe me I'm aware of it and I hate it
05:17 it is possible to go in and meticulously
05:20 take out all those things but man I it's
05:23 hard enough just to creating the hundred
05:24 episodes in one year I think the other
05:27 thing was that I wanted to use some sort
05:30 of music to set the thing off you know a
05:31 lot of shows have music and so in season
05:33 one as you know I just used a ton of
05:36 random tunes and one of them stuck out
05:41 by this guy named Kevin McCleod his name
05:45 so I'm like that and he made that track
05:49 that is the final sound track for the
05:51 opening track for season two which I
05:55 then later found out was being used by
05:58 alien squad I think that's what they
06:01 call themselves they've got a much
06:02 better version tricked out completely
06:05 different form out of a show they're
06:08 really entertainment as I've said in one
06:10 of the episodes in the past you know
06:12 they they create a bunch of fake stuff
06:14 and it's it's just fun it's
06:15 entertainment more power to him but it's
06:18 something you can buy for free and when
06:20 you can buy again
06:21 sorry it's royalty-free you pay buck 29
06:24 for it on iTunes and you can use it and
06:27 it won't register any copyright strike
06:29 on YouTube and that's what the guy does
06:31 he creates these tracks so when I came
06:35 to season 3 I was like I don't want any
06:36 conflicts with someone else's show and
06:38 so I went to some
06:40 site that specializes in this and you
06:43 pay a price and you take it off the
06:45 market so that's what I did now I do
06:48 believe other people can buy that that
06:49 particular tune but you got to pay some
06:51 money for it so I kind of keeps out the
06:54 the cheapskates you know the other thing
06:58 obviously figured out in season one was
06:59 the proximity of the microphone you know
07:02 balancing things not having it right up
07:04 against my face because we did in
07:08 Kilcher radio no one watched us so we
07:10 would put the mic sharp against her face
07:13 and it's really funny because my buddy
07:16 Kyle's the bonafide rocker and he and I
07:19 have done two or three episodes that we
07:21 never aired because he would even though
07:25 he's a professional musician or he has
07:27 been for years and years in addition to
07:29 being a professional special effects guy
07:31 here comes a helicopter he's very
07:33 energetic and and so the last several
07:35 episodes he was looking away from the
07:38 microphone and leaning over and talking
07:40 to me you know outside the microphone
07:41 and so his levels are just atrocious and
07:43 I simply don't have the time to go in
07:46 and increases levels decreases though
07:48 because any ambient noise around him is
07:51 just amplified so sudden street noise
07:53 would surge and you know blind you know
07:55 blank out what I'm saying so I've just
07:58 was never able to get them out the door
08:00 what season two we obviously got an
08:02 intro I felt like and we just filmed
08:05 something put something together I kind
08:06 of wanted to juice it up a little bit
08:08 and for season three I just repeated the
08:11 process refined some of the imagery and
08:13 we were off to the races now I do want
08:16 to talk about the intros a little bit a
08:18 show has to have an identity right
08:21 something that says that's the dude the
08:26 problem is is I don't really like doing
08:28 that I don't really like the the ego
08:32 angle of an intro you know there's the
08:35 Alex Jones Show there's Infowars and he
08:40 he doesn't have himself that much in his
08:43 intros anymore
08:44 I don't know if I can't remember if he
08:45 ever did but boy has he talked about
08:47 himself the whole time right and so I
08:49 thought just is against my entire
08:51 genetic code
08:53 you know I will talk about what I've
08:55 done in life so you understand how
08:56 deeply involved I was with a particular
08:58 subject and I say me all the time give
09:01 you examples for my life but it would i
09:04 hope it's coming off more like I'm your
09:06 buddy we're sitting down talking and
09:08 it's the same old thing you know so I do
09:11 cringe a little bit myself when I see
09:14 myself in the intro it's like well it's
09:18 got to happen and the thing is if I
09:20 built this show up completely without an
09:21 identity then the the rub is that if it
09:26 ever becomes popular it has no identity
09:28 and therefore I think it could be I
09:31 don't know copied in a way by someone
09:34 else you know so I want there to be some
09:37 sort of thing if like it's the black of
09:39 my dude go look at the black on white
09:40 guy look up deep dots on YouTube and
09:42 there's the black of white guy I got a
09:44 lot of [ __ ] about the black and
09:46 white thing actually I don't get that
09:47 much but if there's a complaint in the
09:49 percentage of the complaints which is
09:51 very very low I looked up all the
09:54 comments I think there's 5700 comments
09:58 out of all the videos which I think is
10:00 tremendous and amazing and I think less
10:03 than maybe 10 out of the entire history
10:07 of the show have been negative and I do
10:11 want to talk about the way I handle
10:14 those comments because I get people
10:16 asking me hey there someone was giving
10:18 you a bunch of crap and I went back to
10:21 support you and it looks like you
10:24 deleted the comment and that's not the
10:26 case I'll give you a couple of the times
10:28 that I've ever done that it had nothing
10:30 to do with criticism and had to do with
10:32 the etiquette of posting comments and
10:35 videos but these people will either be
10:37 hacks they will get embarrassed about
10:39 their comment maybe they continue
10:41 watching they delete the comment or I'll
10:44 say something non-confrontational back
10:47 they realized I'm not a jerk and maybe
10:49 they pull it I don't know I'm I don't
10:51 know what they do but they do delete
10:52 their comments from time to time I don't
10:54 go back and check quite frankly right
10:56 with the black and white thing I
10:58 mentioned it once before I'm gonna
11:00 mention it again just so I cover the
11:04 whole thing I have had
11:06 I just have a fondness for
11:07 black-and-white content you know
11:09 Twilight zones Casablanca now I do love
11:13 Wizard of Oz in color so I have nothing
11:15 against color but I really like the
11:17 majestic feel of black and white now
11:20 those astute video editors will look at
11:24 the filter I'm using and so you that's
11:27 not just a black or my filter he's done
11:28 more things to it and it's true it's
11:30 about three things that are layered in
11:31 in Final Cut my secret sauce that gives
11:34 me that tone in that field now you'll
11:36 see that I've experimented with a little
11:38 bit of it in season one I think there
11:40 was even one in video in season one
11:42 where I'll a little bit of color to seep
11:44 through here comes the helicopter again
11:47 so I have done things at times where I
11:49 will collect things that are black and
11:51 white it's sort of just something that I
11:54 like to do so the other big benefit that
12:00 it does for me is that I'm filming at
12:02 different times a day and right now I'm
12:05 in nighttime I kind of like recording at
12:08 night but then I don't like the lack of
12:11 like nature that's operating but you
12:14 know there's there's the bugs at night
12:15 which are kind of cool but I like the
12:16 birds I think that's kind of cool but
12:19 what the black and white does is allows
12:20 me to keep my shows looking very unique
12:23 and very interesting in my opinion and
12:26 it balances out all the color issues so
12:29 you know if the sun's really high the I
12:31 would get major colors on my flesh if
12:33 it's in the early morning or late
12:35 evening I start getting washed out and
12:38 so I don't want a bunch of crappy videos
12:40 with a bunch of crappy color schemes so
12:42 what this does is this pulls out the
12:44 essence of man which is to say he's
12:46 either there or he's not there he's
12:48 either white or he's black I kind of
12:50 like that with season three I really set
12:54 out to plan a lot more of my content
12:57 than I had previous seasons right the
13:00 first two seasons with season 1 it's
13:03 like you have so many things built up
13:06 like I had so many ideas that it
13:08 trickled over from inky ultra radio into
13:12 this thing and in kala to radio aired on
13:14 kicks RZ radio on in LA it's a super
13:18 duper heavy metal station
13:20 that's internet-based but I think it's
13:22 on some other internet pipelines you
13:25 know so most of the cars now have s was
13:28 a serious radio SM whatever and so it
13:33 was getting out in those channels but
13:34 you know our connection to that Ryo
13:36 station kind of died off at Brown the
13:38 same time that Kyle moved north and in
13:42 defaults radio was actually airing on
13:44 that as well so I think at one point but
13:48 one thing I was doing in impaler radio
13:51 was doing these essays where I actually
13:53 would type about one page worth of notes
13:56 very sparse but that kept me on track
13:58 and I would cover something just to kind
14:00 of fill in for the idea that we wanted
14:04 to do a show every Sunday and for the
14:06 most part we would do two or three
14:07 episodes at once and then I would just
14:10 trickle them out right so I was
14:13 releasing the essays on Wednesday nights
14:15 and so I just sort of kind of get that
14:18 got the pump primed for what deep
14:20 thoughts actually turned into now the
14:23 tough thing with this show that I think
14:27 season four is going to demand a lot
14:30 more of is my own personal research into
14:32 very specific I guess you could call
14:36 them conspiracies or stories or whatever
14:38 but nothing you know I don't want to get
14:40 into the terribly dark stuff there's
14:42 plenty of videos on super dark stuff and
14:46 so I'm going to get into again things
14:49 like area 51 you know just sort of all
14:52 the rumors that are around those
14:54 organizations sort of the pros and cons
14:56 for and against the fact that maybe
14:58 they're working with UFOs maybe they're
15:00 working with you know secret aircraft
15:05 that we've created at a wright-patterson
15:07 Air Force Base you know then there's s4
15:09 which I don't know if that's ever even
15:11 been officially validated there's a ton
15:14 of people that say they work for every
15:15 51 and there's there's the methodology
15:18 of protecting that base and the on the
15:22 Obama administration they went and stole
15:23 a bunch of land from this poor family
15:27 they've been roughing them up for about
15:29 you know 40 years trying to get the land
15:31 from them so they could complete
15:33 the jurisdiction in that area to make
15:37 sure no one was ever gonna be allowed on
15:39 there and the family was actually
15:40 willing to sell I know one of the family
15:42 members here in Huntington Beach we
15:44 actually broke the story on em kill to
15:46 radio a week or two before it hit
15:48 national news so stories like that
15:50 things with some pretty cool interesting
15:53 depth to them you know
15:55 now the other criticism the show gets is
15:58 related to its length which doesn't
16:01 really happen anymore it's actually
16:03 pretty cool and we've had hundreds if
16:05 not thousands of new folks that haven't
16:07 complained about in a really really long
16:08 time but as I've told you guys several
16:11 times my closest friends well every once
16:14 in a while who don't really watch the
16:15 show but they know it exists and they
16:17 they look at the show and they're like
16:19 I'd love to watch an episode but I look
16:22 at the time indicator on the episode and
16:25 I don't want to spend an hour and doing
16:27 anything it's not you know directly
16:29 related to what they like to do and I
16:31 told her respect that and I don't need
16:32 any of my friends to watch this show at
16:36 all I have no ego with this thing if
16:38 you're into it you're into it if you're
16:39 not you're not and that's just cool so
16:43 what ended up happening though with
16:46 these longer formats that was just
16:48 something that was a serendipitous
16:52 discovery was it keeps out a lot of the
16:55 trolls trolls are really short attention
16:58 span folks and it was actually today I
17:02 released the last episode Argus
17:05 technically was yesterday morning I
17:07 released the last episode of season 3
17:08 regarding Syd Mead and I posted it on
17:13 the Syd Mead locked Facebook group just
17:16 in case people were interested you know
17:17 you want to hear about your hero he's my
17:19 hero so I'm just talking from having a
17:21 bird's-eye view for a while and I I got
17:26 to of some of the most acidic comments
17:29 I've ever received in the history of
17:32 this show one was on YouTube and this
17:34 guy was going off saying things I
17:36 wouldn't even repeat on this show he's
17:37 like he was just having a diarrhea of
17:40 the mouth moment and he wasn't on point
17:43 with anything I don't even know what
17:44 guy was thinking and then and I deleted
17:49 that comment and I blocked that guy
17:50 because anyone talking like that
17:52 anywhere in the world needs to go to
17:53 some program and get rehabilitated but
17:57 then on the locked Facebook group for
17:59 Sid this guy comes in and says I gave it
18:02 two minutes and which you know man was
18:06 like the intros like 30 seconds so you
18:08 got about a minute and a half and he
18:09 said you know something like I'm really
18:13 proud or now something like I'm really
18:16 glad for you that you know Sid me but
18:18 who cares and this thing should be full
18:20 of tons of pictures and Sid art and dad
18:23 it's like dude the show is an hour and
18:27 14 minutes giveth a few minutes to get
18:30 into it right geez crazy but regarding
18:34 censorship I think you can for those of
18:37 you have seen most the episodes which
18:39 would be most the folks on Facebook have
18:41 seen at least a fair amount of the
18:42 episodes you know on this show we are a
18:46 group and we believe in sovereignty and
18:51 the First Amendment the second member
18:53 protects the first so the last thing on
18:55 earth I'm gonna do is turn into some
18:57 censorship monkey to say no you can't
19:00 disagree with me oh you're out the
19:02 amount of times I've actually banned
19:04 someone off the site again today was
19:06 just one of those moments where it
19:07 happened again and probably last year
19:10 he's probably a little one of the last
19:13 guys and last year I've ever done right
19:15 was if someone is just going off you
19:18 know they are just being super duper
19:21 gross and rude where I wouldn't want to
19:22 I wouldn't want a woman especially to
19:26 read what these guys write and you
19:28 ladies have always kept your cool so
19:29 kudos to you I don't think a single
19:31 woman has crossed the line even remotely
19:33 but the I think there's maybe been three
19:38 people that went over the line language
19:41 wise and just they didn't seem to be on
19:43 point and hey man you can tell me to F
19:45 off and get into the subject matter and
19:47 that's great that's good debate man
19:48 there's nothing wrong with that at all
19:50 but just to be coming in and being
19:53 sexually explicit not talking about the
19:56 episode just
19:57 weird you know people are just drunk
19:58 sometimes I think when they get on these
20:00 YouTube crawls at night but it's really
20:03 happened to us rarely but the one guy
20:06 actually regret because there's not a
20:10 really good interface in YouTube that
20:11 I'm aware of if you know please let me
20:13 know but if you block someone on
20:14 facebook there's a place you can go to
20:17 see their name and unblock them in a
20:20 future point the back when I episode 26
20:25 released I mean we're talking three
20:26 years ago it was about the moon hoax and
20:29 this guy I mentioned him several times
20:31 different episodes I don't remember his
20:32 name but he went in there and as he
20:36 watched the two-hour episode he posted
20:38 about he must have posted about every 30
20:40 seconds to two minutes somewhere in
20:42 there and just you know he was
20:45 shamefully wrong about virtually
20:47 everything he said some of it's just his
20:49 personal beliefs and opinions nothing
20:50 wrong with that I don't know what would
20:53 have happened had he saves it all up in
20:55 a document and posted it all at once it
20:57 would have been probably about a 10 to
20:59 15 page document is hard to tell because
21:02 I just kept getting notifications that
21:05 somebody was posting somebody was
21:07 posting before I turned that crap off
21:08 and at the time I was pretty new to a
21:11 YouTube channel so I was extremely
21:13 fearful that this was going to chase
21:15 everyone away from an episode that was
21:17 pretty cool not because of the
21:18 disagreements that I think they would
21:19 have eaten him alive especially now that
21:21 it's reached almost 13,000 views but
21:25 that he was just bogarting the entire
21:27 channel and that's just not proper
21:29 etiquette you know aside from not doing
21:32 any research with what he was saying but
21:33 he obviously was very hurt by the notion
21:36 that I would suggest that we didn't go
21:38 to the moon you know that's really
21:39 usually the personality that has the
21:41 problem and believe me I understand I
21:43 wish we had gone in my opinion I wish we
21:45 had gone so other than that I mean I
21:50 actually honestly believe I've had to
21:54 gag less than maybe six people in three
21:58 years and deleting comments you know I
22:01 don't delete because what would be the
22:03 point they're just going to come back
22:04 even stronger
22:06 you know so the only time that ever
22:07 happens is they get you know you get
22:10 banned or whatever they know their
22:12 comments get hidden I think that's the
22:14 way it says but then I can't see them
22:15 anymore either so it's just a pain in
22:17 the butt now if I if I could go back I'd
22:20 probably unhide that guy's comments out
22:22 of the moon thing and just let everyone
22:23 if I could go back I'd probably unhide
22:26 his stuff and just let everyone do it
22:27 right just like I just said but they're
22:30 you know what's done is done
22:31 the other one is this cigar and it's
22:35 it's interesting you'll find plenty of
22:37 these comments out there because I don't
22:38 touch them at all but people who get
22:41 really put off by the cigar and I had a
22:45 really close friend of mine whose mother
22:46 died of cigarettes and he used to smoke
22:48 as well and we were out at a casino area
22:54 and he watched this young guy was
22:57 smoking acids which is they're really
22:58 bad for you by the way there's just full
23:00 of all kinds of chemicals and he was
23:03 with two women and my buddy hates cigars
23:06 and so heats tobacco he just look really
23:10 hates tobacco because he lost his mother
23:11 totally understand right but he turned
23:15 around to this guy and he said you know
23:16 I see what you're trying to do you're
23:18 trying to you're trying to be a big man
23:19 with that cigar and I didn't I didn't
23:22 smoke at the time and I was like oh
23:25 that's a weird angle is he is he trying
23:28 to be a big tough guy with the cigar and
23:30 it's like maybe I guess you know I guess
23:33 that's why some people smoke is to feel
23:35 macho and all that kind of stuff now
23:38 that I have been to you know a dozen
23:40 smoked lounges and smoked thousands of
23:43 cigars I don't know if that's true you
23:47 know for most the guys I think it's just
23:49 you know you don't people drink alcohol
23:51 to prove to people that don't exist that
23:53 they're grown up right that's what all
23:55 the teenagers and kids in their 20s do
23:57 they you know some people will try to go
23:59 off the intellectual route and they'll
24:01 go get their fine wines or their
24:05 microbrewery stuff and they go learn all
24:07 about it and who did this and win and
24:09 where and you can't sit down and enjoy
24:11 the beer because they just keep running
24:13 their mouth about it
24:14 but I find annoying but there isn't a
24:19 bone in my body that smokes a cigar to
24:23 feel tough I'm not sure there's anything
24:26 I do to do that you like what you like I
24:29 like what I like and what ends up
24:32 happening is is you know with clothing
24:34 or your hair or your sunglasses it's
24:37 really personable right you wear a tie
24:40 your ties in your shoes it's the famous
24:42 thing for men you know men will wear the
24:45 grossest outfits sometimes but they're
24:47 tying their shoes has to be on target
24:49 right you know cars and motorcycles all
24:53 that kind of stuff there's just
24:54 something about I think masculinity that
24:57 drives towards certain things with a
25:00 cigar you just have something that
25:03 mellows you out yeah you do have to
25:06 acquire the taste and the smell and all
25:08 that kind of stuff so you know when I do
25:10 shows without cigars it's fine you know
25:13 I'm a debate whether or not I want to
25:16 smoke during a show if I do a show
25:18 without smoking what I find out is that
25:21 there is a difference there's definitely
25:23 a difference in the frequency of the
25:25 mind this seems to sort of smooth my
25:29 brain out a little bit so that I can
25:30 easily access the storyline of whatever
25:33 I'm going in you know so there's
25:35 definitely a method to the madness that
25:36 is beyond just liking to smoke it does
25:39 make me look like a huge chain smoker
25:41 cigars I don't think anyone can afford
25:43 to smoke these like cigarettes just you
25:45 know for those of you who smoke cigars
25:47 will tell you that I have found it
25:50 difficult to focus on the cigar and its
25:52 quality while I'm doing a show so like
25:56 there's been a couple of you folks out
25:57 there love you to death you've given me
26:00 these amazing cigars you've mailed them
26:01 to my smoke shop and I absolutely
26:03 enjoyed them but I feared that after I
26:05 got done I didn't enjoy them as much as
26:07 I would had I just sat and smoked them
26:09 with my buddies you know I just really
26:11 go me and that's a stick boom you know
26:13 that's amazing
26:14 because I'm trying to think and trying
26:15 to go through the show so what I
26:17 typically do is get you know a box of
26:20 something I like that I don't have to
26:22 pay attention to so if any of you find
26:24 yourself in that realm where you're
26:27 going to do something it's not focusing
26:29 on the cigar not focusing on a good
26:31 conversation where you can take us take
26:33 a break and let someone else talk and
26:35 you're getting into the foot smoke and
26:36 all that stuff you know you bought my
26:39 smoke one of your cheaper cigars that's
26:42 just a word of advice for you guys and
26:44 just another footnote the bummer about
26:46 cigars is it makes you smell bad makes
26:49 your breath stink and there's very few
26:52 ladies in the world that like that smell
26:54 so you know I got a police that
26:58 sometimes to get around the female my
27:03 life what I would like to do was season
27:06 four although I think it's gonna be
27:07 difficult is to sort of reduce the
27:09 amount of political stuff I let it go a
27:12 little bit with season three part of its
27:15 the old cliche is you have to have some
27:17 skin in the game every once in a while
27:19 so you know I've been trying to make
27:21 these special reports about certain
27:24 political opinions I personally have and
27:27 who I think is winning who I think is
27:28 losing I think needs to be investigated
27:30 who doesn't but I fill out a couple
27:33 episodes ago that we threw my main goal
27:35 with this show I think has evolved over
27:39 time to really be something that's just
27:42 about thinking you know let's think
27:45 about the decisions we've made you know
27:48 because again you know it comes down to
27:50 a few different categories you can I can
27:52 come at you with a subject that just
27:53 says think here's the subject has
27:56 nothing to do with anyone personally
27:57 let's talk about it how do we get these
28:00 have you ever thought about this before
28:01 boom boom boom and your brains just
28:03 churning me and you thinking oh my god I
28:05 did think about that because I I have
28:07 experienced all of this if I ever do
28:09 something to you through conversation
28:11 it's because I did to myself or someone
28:12 did it to me you know like I took
28:14 something for granted and then I finally
28:16 woke up and said well what shape is the
28:18 world I haven't been into space but one
28:21 of those little mind jolts that gets you
28:24 on the right track right of
28:26 investigating something becoming either
28:28 sure of what you believe before or maybe
28:30 adopting a different paradigm altogether
28:32 right now the other one that's a little
28:34 tougher to do but I think is really
28:37 really important
28:39 is wisdom wisdom doesn't seem to exist
28:44 in ample supplies anymore
28:48 everyone's having to figure out
28:49 everything from scratch all over again
28:51 and the sad part about that is that the
28:54 truth of that is is that pain follows
28:57 usually the precursor to discovering
29:00 wisdom you were taught something out of
29:02 books life was supposed to turn out in
29:04 this way and you followed all the rules
29:06 to the best of your ability and nothing
29:09 panned out or most of it didn't pan out
29:11 and you're like oh my god ten years of
29:13 my life just went by er 20 or whatever
29:15 if you're younger two years is an
29:18 eternity and you got in a trap and so
29:25 part of it is I want to make sure that
29:27 all the pain that I've experienced in
29:29 life and in any one of you that have
29:31 experienced a similar pain is similar
29:33 Reena I make a show about it it offers a
29:35 platform for you to push post your reply
29:38 down there and we're all learning from
29:39 each other the other thing too is I
29:42 loved a sort of mental mind you guys
29:47 instead of data-mine your take on
29:50 certain subjects you know I don't
29:54 necessarily have a single episode where
29:56 I walk down on the porch and I said look
29:57 I'm gonna make this episode to get
29:59 people's responses but during the
30:02 episode I started thinking about I start
30:04 going you know when I ask you guys I'll
30:07 say I used to say a lot you know here's
30:09 your homework I need to say that more
30:10 often you guys will come back and just
30:13 blow me away with your take on things
30:16 and so you know this is a communal
30:20 process even though I'm the guy that's
30:22 talking and I guess you guys are the
30:24 folks that are listening but you guys
30:25 have a voice as well someone just
30:27 recently came in to the chat and just
30:31 said look I always listen to this on
30:32 podcast but I just wanted to come in and
30:34 say love it thank you and it's late that
30:37 means a lot to me because getting an
30:39 account on YouTube you know it's so
30:41 stressful and weird switch if you're
30:43 awake what's happening to all my data
30:45 you know the other funny thing I get
30:48 every once in a while and you guys
30:49 probably do too but especially when you
30:52 make a show and it
30:53 is on my mind a long time ago especially
30:56 with MKULTRA radio which is that you
30:58 know we were in the deep state we were
31:00 living inside the belly of the deep
31:02 state you know descent was getting you
31:06 know harassed at all levels and it still
31:08 happens to this day of course but it is
31:12 miniscule and it's disappearing
31:13 hopefully right obviously depending on
31:16 what you say but people would come up
31:19 and say aren't you afraid aren't you
31:22 afraid of saying these things online and
31:24 within key ultra we were really intense
31:27 and not really terribly early with the
31:30 information but we were letting it all
31:32 hang out you know and so yeah man there
31:34 was probably a year where I was like I
31:37 just got to do this I'm willing to die
31:39 for some of this information to get out
31:41 there and how the beautiful thing is is
31:43 again nothing I've ever done on this
31:45 particular show is that profound in any
31:48 you know go get the deep state kind of
31:51 thing I've taught you guys how
31:52 surveillance works you know what's funny
31:55 is it seems as if those that are trying
31:58 to hide from our government in the deep
32:00 state don't understand the simple things
32:02 that I've taught you guys in how they
32:04 spy on you the episode but this whole
32:08 thing this whole awakening you know is
32:10 us sharing information it's just that
32:12 simple they have been able to get away
32:15 with what they've been able to get away
32:16 with because the lefthand can't talk to
32:18 the right hand that's huge
32:21 and now that anomaly at least for almost
32:25 two decades was completely gone you know
32:28 and now they're trying to well they're
32:30 very successfully legislating against
32:32 that in the Europe and I don't know how
32:34 you guys deal with waking up in the
32:36 morning and finding out that your
32:37 freedoms just disappeared a little bit
32:39 more every day I've watched this show on
32:43 it's called the rebel just this weird
32:45 little thing that came out of my smoke
32:46 lounge and it's just a guy that
32:48 interviews people at first I thought it
32:50 was going to be like an infomercial
32:51 about a book and it eventually turned
32:55 out to be pretty enlightening with a guy
32:57 actually said at the end of the episode
32:59 he goes you know I really respect the
33:01 fact that the Americans have the First
33:03 Amendment
33:05 and he's in Canada and he says I really
33:08 wish we had that here because we don't I
33:11 didn't know that I didn't know and I'm
33:14 not sure I mean if you guys live in
33:16 Canada and you're like [ __ ] we do -
33:17 why would this guy say this he was
33:20 absolutely a brilliant human being I
33:22 don't understand the other thing that I
33:25 think is one of my skills in life is two
33:30 things one making very complicated
33:32 things interesting and easy to
33:33 understand that's something that I've
33:35 done that's why I teach because you know
33:37 I am personally a my belief everything
33:40 in the life is easy everything is easy
33:43 but it's not easy up until you know it's
33:46 easy that might sound like a stupid
33:48 statement but you really need to let
33:49 that sink in anything you want to do in
33:51 life is in most cases pretty damn easy
33:57 the other thing is well it was funny
33:59 when I was in my 20s I got a nickname I
34:04 can't remember if it was a girlfriend or
34:06 really close friend of mine probably a
34:08 girlfriend but I got this nickname of
34:10 analogy man which is that I would talk
34:13 in analogies constantly to help people
34:15 understand the perspective of something
34:18 especially something that was you know
34:21 near and dear to their heart that they
34:22 needed to overcome so you know usually
34:25 we can rehabilitate out of bad habits by
34:27 just simply changing our perspective if
34:29 someone drinks a lot because they think
34:31 people care about how macho they are and
34:33 then they realize that person has never
34:35 existed and never will exist and anyone
34:39 that you can attract into your life
34:40 who's impressed by how much drinking you
34:42 do and you know when you're young
34:44 there's exceptions of course you're all
34:45 delusional that's fine but as an older
34:48 person you probably don't want that
34:49 person around you you probably don't I
34:52 mean you may in order to make your
34:54 addiction seem a lot more palatable but
34:57 in the end it's just a perspective
34:59 change and then you go I don't do this
35:01 anymore you know all the prisoners that
35:03 go into prison really young and they
35:04 become super violent because they feel
35:06 like they got to prove themselves to the
35:08 prison they all hold chill out all of
35:11 them shell it takes sometimes it takes
35:12 20 years and then there's like a model
35:15 inmate you know
35:17 right there's a lot of struggles in life
35:20 a lot of them and a lot of times there's
35:24 no one there to talk to you about them
35:26 at all and that's why I think you know
35:30 if you go through all the episodes all
35:32 300 at this point in time and you look
35:36 at the ones with the lowest counts a lot
35:39 of times those are the episodes with the
35:41 most impact for dealing with personal
35:45 issues right and again there's two ways
35:48 to look at a self-improvement category
35:51 episode in this channel it's a whole
35:52 self-improvement playlist
35:56 it could be something you're dealing
35:59 with personally inside your soul and you
36:02 just need someone to talk it out with
36:04 you and again give you a different
36:05 perspective someone who's been through
36:06 it probably right or you're dealing with
36:10 it in that it is someone that's near and
36:12 dear to you your child your spouse your
36:14 father your mother your best friend
36:17 and so you might find something in there
36:21 that either is verbatim what you need to
36:24 tell them or it kicks off another
36:26 thought in your brain that goes oh I
36:29 don't need to tell him what he's saying
36:30 hmm he's got me thinking about what I do
36:34 need to say and there you go you've got
36:37 a little bit of path and again this is
36:40 how we got that old statement it takes a
36:42 village to raise a child it's true it's
36:46 absolutely true for those of you grew up
36:48 in villages you're more healthy and just
36:52 as a digression that's one reason why
36:56 countries have to have electoral
36:58 colleges because you have in many cases
37:03 much healthier Minds in the Midwest of a
37:07 particular country because they are not
37:09 dealing with the fast-paced consumerism
37:12 BS marketing that is getting them to
37:15 worship celebrities and Pho scientists
37:18 and all this other kind of stuff the
37:20 Midwest they're gullible too because
37:22 they're good people and they're
37:22 trustworthy
37:23 right but the wisdom that it's in those
37:26 areas per capita is a thousand times
37:29 better
37:30 then what you get on the coast I've
37:31 lived in both sides so I know this for a
37:33 fact and so we want countries developed
37:37 from these beautiful perspectives of
37:39 wisdom by the voters that would vote
37:41 wisdom back into the country's backbone
37:44 instead of wiping them clean and taking
37:47 all your votes from either you know the
37:48 two coastal regions which are entirely
37:50 delusional the other question is will
37:53 this show ever end and I thought about
37:57 that quite a bit you know when you look
37:59 at a just tell you you know I'm pretty
38:02 prolific and I can talk a lot as you
38:04 have deduced but there may come a time
38:09 when I simply go that's it I may create
38:13 a different show I don't know I talked
38:15 about this a little bit when I was
38:16 ending season two you know if I start
38:19 season four I will finish season four
38:22 pending some a major epiphany you know I
38:26 I get touched by some moment with God or
38:30 something but the trouble that you run
38:33 into with these kind of projects I will
38:35 say all right you say trouble it's sort
38:38 of a challenge internally is that you
38:40 will change so much over a year if
38:43 you're a truther you just will you'll
38:46 come out believe in one thing you'll go
38:48 in sorry believing one thing and come
38:49 out believing something completely
38:51 different
38:51 it could be one show the completely
38:54 changes my perspective problem I go back
38:58 and look at old episodes and I'm like
38:59 crap that episodes completely off-base
39:02 of what I believe I'm misleading people
39:04 into something that you know is
39:07 unhealthy I think there's like two or
39:10 three videos I've actually retired out
39:12 of the playlist that you'll just go down
39:15 the numbers and they'll be missing and
39:19 you know I just think I did one on the
39:22 European Union which I believe I've
39:24 suspended simply because we didn't know
39:26 what was going on we didn't know why
39:28 things were happening the consequences
39:30 of those evolutions is still probably
39:33 still the case but I pulled it because
39:36 it just is I think is a little too
39:39 specific and I'm not
39:42 or maybe wasn't as specific as we would
39:44 be today but it's a pretty dark story as
39:46 to where that whole movement came from
39:48 and I just don't want that DNA in the
39:50 show there's this feeling which shows
39:53 like coast to coast am I love that show
39:56 I do think it's a PSYOP training ground
39:58 the fact that everyone calls into the
40:01 show I mean there's no way their way to
40:02 do it
40:03 George Noory is sitting in some studio I
40:05 think well he changes studios but I
40:07 think he's done it in Los Angeles
40:08 Burbank area at one point in time
40:11 they're heavily censored right George
40:14 Noory
40:14 no no what was it the other guy that
40:17 just passed away god the really deep
40:21 voice you know he was kicked off the
40:23 show he'd used to do like the weekends I
40:25 think he just got too into the truth
40:28 before it was being defended and had he
40:31 waited a couple years into cue and on
40:33 maybe a couple more years into this
40:35 whole movement if these people get a car
40:37 serrated that we think are going to get
40:38 incarcerated or at least Smackdown so
40:41 bad they can't touch anyone anymore
40:42 his format would have been really really
40:44 popular I mean it was very popular don't
40:48 get me wrong but the editors and
40:50 producers of the show or whatever the
40:53 owners of the show probably wouldn't
40:54 have been so scared about his grit right
40:58 but the overall feeling of that show I
41:03 think is sort of what I would like to
41:05 come out of this show which is it's a
41:08 positive place to go you know it's it's
41:12 a tough thing to balance because let's
41:16 just say I'm gonna go right at the
41:17 jugular here I want you to think the
41:19 show is positive and it's it's a
41:21 contributing thing to your life yeah I'm
41:25 sure you'll guys will go in and out of
41:26 the show I used to watch it I don't need
41:28 more I got back into it oh my god of old
41:30 episodes blah blah blah that kind of
41:32 thing but if I were to go at something
41:34 as polarized as the existence of Jesus
41:40 Christ something like that it's gonna be
41:42 really really tough for folks to listen
41:44 to if you believe he existed and I'm
41:48 constantly reinforcing the fact that I
41:50 used to think he existed I went down
41:52 that realm
41:52 I still think his message is something
41:54 every human being
41:55 needs to read I wouldn't force it on
41:58 anyone through laws but I you know where
42:01 else to get a book of morals and for
42:03 little short stories that are just
42:04 simply telling one person's life four
42:06 times pretty amazing there's a lot more
42:09 things in the Bible that are great but
42:10 I'm just saying those four books Matthew
42:12 Mark Luke John amen
42:14 I couldn't beat it I could only
42:17 plagiarize it so I've got to figure out
42:19 a way to play the 4d chess of
42:24 information I think is important it's
42:27 interesting without crossing lines you
42:30 know I had the Big Foot episode well the
42:33 Big Foot episode you know I don't
42:34 believe that Bigfoot's exist anymore
42:38 hominids and yetis have existed we've
42:41 seen their bones maybe they're real who
42:44 the hell knows anymore but doing that
42:48 episode right in the middle episode I
42:50 barely had any planning I've done a lot
42:52 of sort of kind of shady tree
42:54 investigating where people have done
42:57 these hoaxes you know that kind of thing
42:59 what a horrible world hoaxes and so I'm
43:04 in the middle and I start talking about
43:06 the mating rituals of these things and
43:07 how they would have to call each other
43:09 out during mating cycles just like cats
43:11 do and they'd have to carry a child and
43:13 they're gonna be kind of in mobile when
43:15 they're super duper pregnant and they're
43:17 gonna have to give birth and depending
43:19 on how resilient the child is you know
43:22 its first few days of life or months of
43:24 life it's gonna have to have a family
43:26 unit which is sort of how they're
43:27 molding the story now but I'm telling
43:29 you in this Bigfoot episode I don't
43:31 think he's this I'm giving you my
43:32 hundred reasons why I think that's the
43:34 case that's where there's sort of
43:37 resistance to people that would find the
43:39 video and say I totally found this video
43:42 and I wanted to watch it because I
43:43 believe in Bigfoot and now this kids
43:44 telling me a million reasons why he
43:47 doesn't think it's real it takes a
43:49 really big person to listen to that and
43:51 and get to the end and not blow their
43:54 top right and a lot of you are that way
43:57 so again I commend you guys a thousand
43:59 percent
44:00 to that degree you're probably more
44:02 intellectually sound than I am the other
44:06 thing that's very interesting is that
44:09 you know there are folks that devote
44:11 their lives to one subject their whole
44:13 lives they get into Roswell Bigfoot UFOs
44:19 in general they get into Flat Earth
44:22 million different theories and they
44:25 really dedicate their life to it and
44:26 they're very passionate about it and
44:28 they just have this they have their
44:29 instinctual feeling for it being true I
44:31 totally respect that
44:33 and you know if there was an easy format
44:37 to schedule a session in a studio or
44:40 whatever and there'd be an easy way to
44:43 find guests and bring them in and talk
44:45 and people who are good on a microphone
44:46 and could go back and forth maybe a
44:49 different show could come around right
44:51 my sort of you know next level fantasy
44:56 is to treat this show like most radio
45:01 shows do so George Noory comes in and he
45:04 has information prepared for him just
45:07 sort of like at Johnny Carson that would
45:08 have his monologue options prepared and
45:11 then he comes in and says I think that
45:12 jokes good this one's bad why don't we
45:14 get a joke about Reagan today but Papa
45:16 with this kind of show and coast to
45:19 coast am someone will say hey there was
45:22 no five things that happened today that
45:24 we're really weird of fish you know or
45:27 some weird animal washed up on the coast
45:29 we got some pictures of that so you can
45:31 talk about that I got this guest already
45:32 queued up to talk about the guy that
45:34 found the thing we got his phone number
45:36 we talked to him you know some UFO
45:39 sightings were over Phoenix Arizona we
45:41 got some video clip of that you can talk
45:43 about it driving to the website to
45:44 subscribe also there kind of stuff no I
45:47 don't care missa something about the
45:48 subscription part of it but having a
45:52 group of producers that are like-minded
45:54 that have a much deeper grasp of things
45:57 than I do but could say look you talked
46:00 about this episode in that episode so
46:01 there is this whole wing of what you
46:04 talked about I don't think you even know
46:06 about here's a book I've paraphrased a
46:09 bunch of things that you need to know or
46:11 here's the pages that you need to read
46:12 out of this book here's the PDF go buy
46:15 the book from whatever and really
46:17 increase the actual you know regularity
46:21 of the shows the
46:22 quality of the shows the amount of
46:24 in-depth research just basically turned
46:28 into a real show you know at the same
46:30 time I run the risk of destroying the
46:33 organic nature of the show me just
46:36 pulling that out of my head I think that
46:39 there is something that happens while
46:40 I'm doing the show and as much as I hate
46:43 saying that I do think this cigar
46:45 actually sort of helps me dial into it
46:47 and I sort of wish that wasn't the case
46:50 in some regards but when you sit down or
46:54 when I sit down I'll just put this way
46:56 when I sit down and I start doing this
46:57 show obviously have a subject and sort
47:02 of an instinctual angle that is driving
47:05 me to the subject like I don't feel like
47:07 people are talking about this enough and
47:09 so I get in there and I hit those things
47:11 while I'm talking to you guys that hook
47:13 is gone in about 10-15 minutes tops
47:16 and so what ends up happening is is sort
47:20 of that agnostic thing my definition of
47:21 ignite of agnostic knowledge is sort of
47:23 you're opening your your soul up to the
47:27 universe and saying look I'm doing a
47:29 query on this subject right now send me
47:32 everything you have and in my mind I get
47:34 the pictures of the chronology of the
47:37 subject matter that's how this thing
47:38 goes now this particular episode I'm
47:40 just wandering around in my brain at the
47:43 amount of times that I am setting up
47:44 this equipment and I have no idea what
47:48 I'm gonna cover and I sit down and
47:50 pretty much I plop myself down I mean
47:52 I'll be sitting or staring at the
47:54 computer showing me the Soundwave of
47:56 what I'm saying
47:57 and something will just come in there
48:00 and all of a sudden magic happens I'll
48:03 create a video most the time I know if I
48:06 if I have gold or not sometimes I'll
48:08 record one and man it's like I'll sit on
48:10 my computer for two weeks while I'm
48:12 releasing other episodes and I'm looking
48:14 at that episode going man is that any
48:15 good
48:16 I don't really have a feeling for this
48:17 one and I'll listen to it I'll go oh my
48:19 god that really turned out well
48:21 put it out there and you guys will give
48:22 me really good comments on it so I think
48:26 that reveals a little bit of the
48:28 mechanics of the universe to me
48:29 personally so I think you knowing that
48:33 hopefully that gives you the indication
48:35 of what
48:36 you might be able to do as well if you
48:39 constantly hold back and say man I'm not
48:41 going to do this until I know everything
48:43 about it
48:43 you're gonna lose out but those of you
48:47 have ever raised a child I don't know
48:50 that anyone was completely ready for
48:52 kids I mean you might have the hubris
48:54 that you're ready and then you get the
48:55 kid and starts kicking your butt but a
48:57 lot of the folks that are terrified
48:59 having kids soon as they have on they're
49:01 like this is the greatest thing ever
49:02 you know taking risks with your career
49:05 that's another huge one you get in there
49:08 and you're like man I know enough to be
49:10 dangerous I'm going to dedicate myself
49:12 and get the differential that my job
49:15 requires and then you sail through it
49:18 and you have these amazing
49:19 accomplishments the fact is if you don't
49:22 try nothing's gonna happen right the old
49:25 cliche I think the bottom line with
49:28 things like this is that today this show
49:31 has a value because we've all climbed
49:34 into our virtual friendships instead of
49:36 our personal friendships I think the
49:39 other thing that gives the show value is
49:40 that again our educational system is
49:44 kind of in crappy I've been very
49:46 fortunate to have a lot of different
49:48 careers and and mentor a ton of people
49:50 through a ton of different things and so
49:52 I'm just sort of regurgitating hopefully
49:57 the best refinements of these moments to
50:00 you guys that you guys can do whatever
50:02 you want with it be entertained by it
50:03 use it in your life whatever right I
50:06 constantly think of I believe it's
50:08 Socrates who said something to the
50:10 effect of you know the greatest thing I
50:12 ever figured out was that I knew nothing
50:13 that is probably the most absolute truth
50:17 with a capital T that exists that you
50:20 don't know anything but you try to and I
50:24 think that's what we have to do that's
50:26 what this journey is about you know part
50:30 of its dealing with the cards that
50:31 you've been dealt to better yourself to
50:35 go through certain struggles and the
50:36 other half is to be aggressive and say
50:40 you know what I'm not gonna accept these
50:42 cards today I don't know what's gonna
50:44 happen by me not accepting these cards
50:46 but I'm just not going to accept them
50:49 and you throw them away and you go
50:51 forced someone to deal you some other
50:53 cards maybe don't even use cards for
50:55 your life in that particular realm right
50:56 I think it's probably true for most
50:59 people on this planet that we all have
51:01 something that were I think we're crying
51:05 out for help it doesn't have to be
51:08 anything drastic and severe and
51:11 tear-jerking and that kind of thing but
51:12 you know I'll give it my own experience
51:15 when I came out to California and
51:18 started you know being a professional
51:20 engineer at 18 years old it was and I
51:24 was making money I didn't know what to
51:25 do with it I didn't know how to save it
51:27 I was really good at budgeting and that
51:29 kind of stuff and balancing my checkbook
51:30 and all that kind of stuff but when you
51:32 barely have enough money to survive on
51:33 at first there's no wisdom I didn't have
51:38 any wisdom of how to deal with what I
51:40 was dealing even the more I succeeded
51:41 the worse it got you know I had give you
51:46 an example when I first got out here one
51:49 of the coders top coders of the now
51:52 TurboTax product was a guy that he's
51:56 about 26 years old and his father forced
51:59 him to buy a house and it was really
52:01 racking him hard because he's like man I
52:03 do make enough money to pay the mortgage
52:05 but man this is going to consume all my
52:06 money but his father forced into my
52:08 house this is back when that sort of
52:11 investment vehicle was really much
52:16 easier to do your mortgage payments
52:17 weren't it's like this death sentence
52:20 that they are today at least in
52:21 California and then I would I went
52:24 through like probably 15 more years of
52:26 my career made a ton of money and
52:28 realized I never invested in anything I
52:30 mean I did I bought hardware for my
52:32 music studio and a few other things so I
52:34 was always able to kind of resell my
52:36 products or my hardware at a later date
52:38 sometimes I made money sometimes I at
52:41 least paid got my money back sometimes I
52:43 ate it you know I was like I sold it for
52:45 a tenth of what I paid you know because
52:47 it's just one of those things so in the
52:49 end I realized when you do something
52:52 that your family members have never done
52:54 before at this level at this level of
52:56 acceleration this velocity
52:59 they don't have anything for you they
53:01 don't have any wisdom to give you and so
53:03 you have to find your mentors where you
53:05 can find them and you'll find them in
53:07 characters that you don't know and
53:09 you'll never meet but you watch how they
53:11 manage your life and you try to take
53:12 what they did what you think they did
53:14 right even if you're misunderstanding
53:16 what they did as long as it's a benefit
53:18 to you who cares you misunderstood a
53:20 good thing great but trying to find a
53:23 real-life mentor in this world was very
53:25 tough for me very very tough so I had to
53:29 become my own mentor and that's sort of
53:33 you know you're it's hard to be good at
53:36 that right it doesn't even make any
53:37 sense
53:38 what's the definition of the word it's
53:41 the definition of the word well what's
53:43 the definition I don't know it's a
53:44 circular logic problem right so a lot of
53:47 what I learned was just doing everything
53:48 the wrong way the first probably a
53:51 couple times at least and then you know
53:54 looking back and just saying geez man
53:57 you know I probably wouldn't do much
53:59 different in my life if I went back to
54:00 do it all over again I just simply do it
54:02 all over again
54:03 but when I see young kids now you know I
54:07 really get in there and go you know what
54:08 are you doing what do you what are you
54:10 majoring it in school if you're going to
54:11 school if you have a trade skill awesome
54:13 what are you doing what's your where
54:14 your passions where you want to be in
54:16 five years ten years that sort of thing
54:18 used to hate that question so let me
54:21 give you some homework just post it
54:25 right inside the Facebook group if you
54:26 can this will be an unlisted YouTube
54:28 video so you can do either way I'll get
54:30 it what are your thoughts about this
54:33 show where it could where it could go
54:37 and I want you to keep in mind that if
54:39 you have a improvement for the show keep
54:44 in mind that I have limited time as much
54:46 as it may not look like I do I'll
54:49 usually bang out you know two or three
54:50 episodes in a particular week and then I
54:52 won't record for two or three weeks
54:54 because work will demand something I'll
54:56 need to fly around the world or whatever
54:58 but something that might be fairly easy
55:03 to research some of you guys again
55:06 you've given me amazing ideas but by god
55:08 when I look at the minimum amount of
55:10 research to do your idea
55:12 justice to really respect your
55:15 suggestion it is beyond my capacity at
55:18 this point of my life to do so I
55:21 apologize for that your ideas are great
55:23 a lot of times so just keep in mind you
55:28 know there's some formula in there that
55:29 is doable and there's a certain
55:34 threshold of dedication that I simply
55:36 don't have at this particular point in
55:38 my life right now what we could start
55:41 doing in this show is those of you who
55:45 are interested in applying your time
55:48 very soon you'll find out how rough it
55:50 is on me but if you can suggest a
55:55 subject that you know I haven't covered
55:57 that there's you know the show you know
55:59 whether or not I'd be interested in it
56:00 and again it could be that I would have
56:02 never have thought of it that some of my
56:04 favorite suggestions but maybe you can
56:07 help me do the research through you know
56:10 just chat me the deep mind account on
56:12 Facebook just chat me sort of you know
56:15 articles I can quickly get through a
56:17 video I could maybe mmm hopefully
56:20 quickly watch you know and quickly watch
56:22 would probably be either it's a really
56:25 long video and you've got some key time
56:27 sinks in there that would hook me and
56:30 get me what I need to know and again if
56:32 I if I get into a video and I love it
56:34 I'm gonna watch everything I'm gonna get
56:36 into the whole thing but considering I
56:40 barely have any research for any of
56:42 these things I'm just pulling it on my
56:43 own personal knowledge of I guess I
56:45 can't say I barely have any research of
56:47 things but it's I already have the
56:48 research or I've already watched ten
56:51 hours of videos on a particular thing it
56:52 just kind of sat in my head and I was
56:54 like I should just do a video about this
56:55 right but if you guys want to put
56:58 together ideas I feel free I mean we can
57:02 make this a lot more communal I know
57:05 that when I was a kid
57:07 in fact you know I've had YouTube guys
57:08 that I have followed for silly things
57:11 and I would put a suggestion in and they
57:13 would acknowledge it and they would
57:14 incorporate it in a future video and
57:16 that just made me feel great it was like
57:17 cool we were of like mind enough that
57:20 this forum worked
57:22 that's it exchange instead of just as a
57:24 one-way pipe
57:26 it's happening all the time but maybe we
57:28 can formalize that a little bit you guys
57:30 are really smart folks I know you get it
57:32 I wanted to make this particular episode
57:35 just for you guys on Facebook one I'm
57:40 not exactly sure what changes I'll make
57:42 to the next version of the show I'm
57:45 always trying to like spice it up for
57:46 you guys more than anything I'm pretty
57:49 sure it's gonna look exactly the same my
57:52 goal of getting the 4k camera never
57:55 really occurred so we'll see you know
57:58 I'm curious if it even matters you know
57:59 just really good fine grainy
58:01 black-and-white stuff
58:03 I think the mic is still pretty strong
58:05 the software is awesome now my pipeline
58:08 is really clean for getting these things
58:10 edited and out the door I think that the
58:12 major change that we can make with this
58:14 particular show is just refining the the
58:16 content for a particular season and sort
58:19 of have the do's and dont's you know
58:21 some of these things might be real
58:23 important and involves some fairly
58:25 tumultuous data that you have to get
58:27 through special reports are a great way
58:30 to do that put them out get in massive
58:32 detail and then yank them after they
58:35 don't have any value you know it's sort
58:38 of I don't know it's interesting I've
58:44 done episodes though that I think are
58:45 fantastic but simply aren't relevant
58:47 anymore and it's hard to see them in the
58:50 queue or see them in my list of videos
58:52 and they're off and they still must stay
58:55 off but I'm like man that was some good
58:57 information in that video it's really
58:59 funny how that works
59:00 anyhow no bumper on this because you
59:03 guys are already in the club so take
59:06 care of yourself and someone else and
59:07 I'll see you in the next season of deep
59:09 thoughts
59:10 open up
