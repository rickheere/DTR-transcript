00:00 [Music]
00:33 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:35 gentlemen on this particular episode I
00:38 want to discuss sharing conspiracies
00:42 because sometimes you can share a bunch
00:44 of conspiracies with a single individual
00:46 and there they're sort of surprised that
00:49 anyone believes anything other than what
00:51 is official and other times you run into
00:54 people that have put a lot of thought
00:56 into it and perhaps they have
00:59 conspiracies of their own that are maybe
01:01 different than yours maybe not as deep
01:03 as yours maybe even deeper I have an
01:08 interesting experience I've been having
01:10 recently because something was uncovered
01:15 for a friend of mine that is in the
01:21 entertainment business I would say and
01:25 they've been involved in different
01:27 projects through various proxies I'm not
01:29 going to reveal what these projects are
01:32 at least at this time without them with
01:38 me but we actually sit around and we
01:43 have but we sort of have a laugh at the
01:47 conspiracies that surround some of these
01:50 entertainment projects that this person
01:53 is involved in or has been involved in
01:55 in the past that sort of thing and I've
01:57 got several friends that will
01:59 accidentally find themselves the victims
02:02 of conspiracies simply because a piece
02:07 of information wasn't shared and then
02:11 you hear you know people digging they're
02:14 trying to dig and that's the that's the
02:16 new thing with especially the after P
02:18 movement the 17 movement and it's good
02:22 you know because we're going after some
02:23 pretty bad folks but you know not all
02:25 conspiracies are even considered by
02:27 those researching them to be negative
02:31 but I want to bring up this and here's
02:35 the catalyzing thing because this person
02:37 I were chatting tonight
02:39 I'm just watching TV I'd finished dinner
02:41 we've managed to sync up our schedule
02:43 enough to share you know half an hour
02:45 with the chat on the phone because there
02:50 was a new one that came in about this
02:54 persons area of expertise and knowledge
02:55 because that person was either there or
02:59 close enough to know and we're sort of
03:03 laughing this thing off and it occurred
03:06 to me because we have we have two
03:09 hemispheres of conspiracy's right we
03:13 have this 17 movement and those
03:16 conspiracies are big people are getting
03:18 hurt nations are getting taken over
03:22 people being trafficked just criminal
03:25 criminal criminal wars that are started
03:28 by guys like McCain who pretended to be
03:31 war heroes a war hero excuse me well
03:35 real war heroes go and fight the wars
03:38 they don't have daddy and granddaddy as
03:41 Navy Admirals to erase them from the
03:43 Forrestal accident he was an amazing
03:47 that the Forrestal accident were John
03:49 McCain goofing off on his on the deck of
03:54 that aircraft carrier responsible for I
03:57 think killing 134 people injuring a
03:59 hundred and sixty-five eight of which
04:01 will be missing for the rest of history
04:03 they get shot down by the Vietcong gives
04:06 up 32 34 plus confession tapes comes
04:11 back a war hero and he's but on the
04:16 Forrestal his father and his granddaddy
04:18 erased him from ever being on the
04:20 Forrestal so he wouldn't be you know in
04:22 the report as liable for doing the wet
04:25 start on his jet which shook off the
04:28 ordnance that killed everybody and yet
04:31 there's History Channel specialist about
04:32 what a [ __ ] hero this guy was jumping
04:34 out of his plane and basically going
04:36 underground and helping to push some
04:38 ordnance off until I get bored or tired
04:40 knitting which the officer's club to
04:42 watch the whole thing go down its least
04:45 at least those are this that's the story
04:47 that the people who died you know the
04:49 people who didn't die excuse me we're
04:50 trying to put out the fire left us with
04:53 they were there we weren't so I'm taking
04:55 their their advice for it so we have
04:58 serious conspiracies that need to be
05:00 fixed that day in September 11th right
05:04 all right big ones and then we had these
05:09 silly ones now when I first started deep
05:15 thoughts there was a really interesting
05:17 thing that happened where people were
05:20 there was a sort of conspiracy going
05:23 around it goes around every once while I
05:25 haven't haven't heard about in a while
05:27 I think people wised up a little bit
05:28 because they started to realize how
05:30 silly they sounded now the real
05:33 conspiracy is that there are people in
05:35 Hollywood and music and all over the
05:38 place that use hand gestures and serious
05:40 photo you know various photographing
05:43 techniques to symbolize that they are a
05:45 part of a an occult Club one of the big
05:49 ones is to do this 666 thing over your
05:51 eye like this right and I am very
05:54 dismayed to learn that some people who
05:58 do this because up until the point I saw
06:01 them do that in a photograph
06:02 I was admirer of those these individuals
06:06 and now I'm shocked I was a huge fan of
06:10 prints and he definitely did plenty of
06:12 shots where half of his face was on the
06:14 album and this is where we really want
06:17 to start digging but I started doing
06:18 this show and making hand gestures and I
06:21 did that I did the other day I did this
06:23 this sort of six-six-six thing I think I
06:26 saw my hand do it I did it off to the
06:28 side and it's kind of hard at night to
06:29 see my hand but I did it and I realized
06:33 when I looked through the table I was
06:34 like oh my god here we go I'm gonna get
06:36 someone saying look he's doing the
06:37 symbol secretly he's part of this I
06:40 don't even know what group that is I
06:42 don't know if that's Mason or [ __ ] if I
06:47 know something else right when I imagine
06:51 how some some categories of conspiracies
06:54 are really tight I think the 17 movement
06:58 is huge I think it's very well organized
07:00 we have hundreds and hundreds of posts
07:05 if not thousands of posts
07:06 of the 17 individual and then there's
07:09 tens of thousands of maybe even a
07:12 hundred thousand posts responsible or in
07:14 response to the 17s pose so we have a
07:16 very structured and anticipation model
07:19 for that particular category and then we
07:22 have these conspiracies about symbology
07:25 and a bunch of other stuff where we are
07:28 more loose and there's no one really
07:31 like a seventeen person leading the
07:34 March now the 17 do touches on a bunch
07:38 of stuff he touches on a cult symbolism
07:41 and all kinds of stuff so he is trying
07:42 to help out us sorting this other stuff
07:46 out but my concern is this there are
07:51 people out there who jump on board with
07:53 conspiracies and they do jackal research
07:58 the immediately adopt the most extreme
08:01 concepts and then they don't apply logic
08:06 to what they're saying now if I have
08:10 been a touch on a conspiracy that up
08:12 until I said something you were
08:14 completely on board I'm not attacking
08:16 you trust me if anything I'm trying to
08:19 give us some clarity here but I've had
08:22 and I'm gonna go through a few of these
08:24 but the main point of this episode is we
08:26 have to be a little bit careful not to
08:28 create a mob rules groupthink mentality
08:31 on our end of the truth movement and
08:33 believe me if they can figure out a way
08:35 to create this problem within our
08:37 movement and they probably already have
08:39 then we might start attacking innocent
08:43 people attacking each other because
08:46 people were saying that I were I was
08:47 signaling in my episodes and sort of
08:49 communicating it was like it's kind of
08:52 funny I think about if there was any
08:54 type of sign language with this
08:57 symbology that they have which I have no
09:00 knowledge of I mean I know a couple hand
09:02 gestures here and there but they're
09:05 seeing me say gibberish because they
09:06 don't they know I have no clue what I'm
09:08 doing right but I'll give you an example
09:11 of one that is romantic I guess but
09:15 makes no logical sense
09:19 people have recently said they think
09:21 that just really three people came into
09:25 my channel three different human beings
09:27 and they said very politely hey do you
09:30 think Alex Jones is Bill Hicks now for
09:34 those of you don't know who Bill Hicks
09:35 is and especially if you didn't grow up
09:36 in the United States at all Bill Hicks
09:38 was a brilliant super cynical comedian
09:43 he makes Lenny Bruce look like Robin
09:47 Williams this guy he was awake as much
09:52 as she could be and he was just cynical
09:54 he was just like oh you think you know
09:56 everything well you know [ __ ] and let me
09:59 just tell you how it goes and he would
10:00 have things pinned down now he had some
10:02 really just straight-up funny stuff that
10:05 was cynical he liked to smoke cigarettes
10:07 oh my god he smoked cigarettes hey Chane
10:11 smoked him Shane smoked him during a
10:13 show and then eventually he quit and he
10:16 died of I believe the cancer supposedly
10:19 as a result of his cigarettes not hard
10:23 to believe once you see this guy smoke
10:25 but now you look at Bill Hicks I think
10:28 he was 32 somewhere in there when he
10:30 died in the early 90s that's 30 years
10:35 ago roughly 25 30 years ago Alex Jones
10:40 he's younger than me if you were to take
10:45 anyone let's just say Alex I can't
10:47 remember how old the guy is let's say
10:48 he's 45 years old and you add 20 years
10:52 to it and he's gonna be 25 to get back
10:54 to Bill Hicks death okay so he's 70
10:57 years old yeah yeah Alex Jones is 70
11:00 [ __ ] years old really you really
11:03 think that that's possible the [ __ ]
11:06 guy is just what he's sucking down
11:08 adrenal chromes and looking better than
11:11 anyone in the royal family any one of
11:13 these Rothschilds or Rockefellers yeah
11:16 Alex Jones has got the best stuff on
11:19 planet Earth ridiculous hey it's okay to
11:22 ask the question but apply some logic to
11:25 it and you'll erase half this crap the
11:29 more that a conspiracy makes you angry
11:31 because you think there's been some
11:33 serious harm and boy you know there's
11:35 plenty of those aren't there then we
11:38 have to double down on our research and
11:40 our confirmation and our logic as much
11:43 as possible this friend of mine has
11:45 reminded me in being accused the
11:50 projects that this person has been
11:51 involved and I've been around in their
11:53 lifetime and just seeing the silliness
11:57 they've reminded me look make sure you
12:00 really really research things and I've
12:02 mentioned this in an episode that hasn't
12:04 aired yet I can't more which one but
12:06 it's coming and it did put a shock into
12:10 my heart of yeah you know it's one of
12:13 these things to be like my Mars episode
12:15 my Mars mission episode the hoax but I
12:19 believe was coming at some point in the
12:21 next 20 30 years you know I got a bunch
12:25 of facts either wrong or the estimations
12:27 it really is like the estimations are
12:29 really bad so I narrated it in our
12:31 annotated it in the YouTube video I've
12:35 said a million times you know I don't
12:36 like getting anything wrong but I do
12:37 usually need to put it in the video or I
12:42 put it in the description as an errata
12:44 just like a book these are the things
12:46 that got wrong Pete Conrad I got his
12:51 name mixed up with Michael Collins poor
12:54 Michael Collins we don't want an
12:57 inquisition 2.0 stemming out of this
13:02 truth movement we really really really
13:06 do need to keep up with our justice
13:11 system at least you know I can speak for
13:14 America we've got a pretty good we've
13:18 got a pretty good set of rules on paper
13:19 now whether or not they're ever followed
13:21 well that just depends on if you're you
13:24 know you're that dude for making a
13:26 murderer it's gonna sue the state for 44
13:28 million dollars and then oops all of a
13:29 sudden someone visited your house sends
13:31 up dead and cops are framing you for it
13:34 and putting you in jail for the rest of
13:35 your life so no to pay the money you
13:37 couldn't be you could be snapped up they
13:42 can frame you and they just
13:45 nobody really needs any facts anymore
13:47 half the time right how do you think all
13:48 these ffs are happening around the world
13:53 no one cares about the facts at all
13:57 you could have conclusive proof that a
14:01 bunch of people who are said to have
14:02 been murdered at a particular event are
14:04 still alive walking around we got
14:06 photographs of them they're singing at
14:08 the half bull or that's very Super Bowl
14:10 halftime we see them later and later and
14:13 later they keep growing up to keep
14:15 hanging out together alright nobody
14:20 cares nobody cares about to follow up
14:23 there was an interesting thing and I
14:26 want to draw a comparison here when you
14:29 watched Walking Dead those first three
14:32 or four seasons which were gold the
14:35 first two seasons especially the first
14:37 one was actually based on this whole
14:38 thing where Rick was trying to hang on
14:40 to humanity he was trying to say look we
14:43 can't start acting like animals because
14:45 we'll become animals and his buddy Shane
14:49 that actor is amazing by the way
14:51 he's like brother it's over man look at
14:54 the world this is not coming back we're
14:57 not gonna have some cure fall from the
14:58 sky and zombies are gonna become human
15:01 again and we're gonna live the life we
15:03 used to live this is the different world
15:04 we need to change or we're gonna perish
15:06 and he was correct
15:08 boy did I ever find out that Shane was
15:10 right but we're not at the apocalypse
15:14 yet what are we trying to do what world
15:17 are we going for I don't think any of us
15:19 can answer that question perfectly but I
15:22 can't as I use the fictional world of
15:25 Star Trek as a goal Gene Roddenberry's
15:27 world is sort of where I want to go full
15:30 blown space travel amazing medicine you
15:34 know you break your arm man you just go
15:36 to the doctor or go hell you go to the
15:39 pantry well mom grabs the little wand
15:43 and fixes your bone and resets
15:44 everything up and you're back out and
15:46 you're playing with your buddies no
15:48 money we just do things because we know
15:50 they need to be done and we're proud of
15:52 our work and perhaps we even rotate
15:54 through jobs that maybe aren't so
15:56 rewarding
15:56 maybe robots do all this stuff we don't
15:58 want to do
15:58 knows something but do we want another
16:04 apocalyptic precursor to these beautiful
16:08 worlds that we can envision inside of
16:10 our head I mean maybe that's what it
16:11 takes at some point maybe comes down to
16:14 all those punk-ass bastards that walk up
16:17 to people and coal cog them with maggot
16:19 maggots on maybe it is you know cleaning
16:22 out the genetics who knows cars tomato
16:25 whatever if they do capital punishment
16:28 on an innocent person then we do capital
16:30 punishment on them to make sure their
16:31 gene stops I don't know hope it doesn't
16:34 come to that
16:35 but we do not want in my opinion to be
16:40 responsible for crazy now we know that
16:44 when we invite folks into the conspiracy
16:47 room and I say that loosely because
16:51 they're already there and in most cases
16:53 the people I'm talking about there are
16:55 people that believe everything and it's
16:59 sort of you know the ones that have the
17:01 problem are the ones that are believing
17:06 in conspiracies for all the wrong
17:08 reasons they want to be special they do
17:11 like the world burning they don't have
17:15 control of their life or they don't have
17:17 something special in their life don't
17:19 have a project and so this is their
17:22 project this is what gives them their
17:24 purpose and it properly honed and if
17:27 there's a process involved which is
17:29 again you hear conspiracy you apply
17:30 logic to it and then reassess reassess
17:35 reassess until you've cut away
17:37 everything and whatever is left after
17:40 akhom raisers been judiciously used
17:44 against a particular conspiracy you can
17:46 start believing or at least piecing
17:48 together a belief system about what's
17:50 left another way someone told me in the
17:53 comments I just want to make sure you
17:55 all saw this it was his belief that
17:58 JFK's cast JFK Jr's cast was cut off two
18:02 days before he got in the plane and
18:04 disappeared going to Martha's Vineyard
18:08 if that is truly the case I didn't know
18:13 how to verify that someone is passing a
18:16 photograph around of him at the airport
18:18 on crutches as if that was the day that
18:22 he was going on that plane so there's an
18:25 example I'll repeat something that's not
18:28 not true
18:29 now Occam's razor is a very interesting
18:31 scientific tool which again is is
18:35 designed to refine what is actually
18:38 being observed or what is actually being
18:40 considered by again eliminating just
18:43 like algebra you simplify the algorithm
18:45 so you get you simplify out every little
18:47 number on the side of the equal sign
18:51 where the equation exists so that the
18:54 equal by product is much easier to
18:57 calculate I think in the conspiracy room
19:02 what this is really well doesn't what
19:06 this could be aimed at is emotion from
19:10 pre indoctrination there are some
19:13 conspiracies that are so diabolical just
19:16 like David Rockefeller said I believe in
19:21 1979 at the press dinner press corps
19:24 dinner he said thank you all for not
19:27 reporting on the things that we need you
19:29 to be quiet about that was that dinner
19:32 and then he said you know as long as we
19:35 commit conspiracies or engaging
19:39 conspiracies that the world can't
19:41 believe because they're so horrific the
19:43 mind can't conceive of it and therefore
19:45 we get away with whatever we want
19:48 emotions are interesting when it comes
19:53 to conspiracy sometimes someone
19:57 identifies with a conspiracy because you
20:01 know sometimes a conspiracy is the way
20:03 history is told these people conspired
20:05 against these people and this thing
20:06 occurred and someone identifies with it
20:10 they're even taught from birth to
20:12 identify with a particular history that
20:15 is a particular conspiracy okay but then
20:19 later in life they hear that the
20:20 conspiracies different
20:23 why because the first conspiracies based
20:26 on yeah some evidence but a lot of
20:32 history and a lot of conspiracy are told
20:35 by those who commit the crime right
20:37 JFK where did you hear that he was
20:40 assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald by
20:44 those that killed JFK the Mockingbird
20:48 press they're the ones that told you who
20:52 did what when and how where did you
20:55 learn that we went to the moon from
20:58 those that committed the conspiracy and
21:00 it regardless of how many times you see
21:04 that archetype of those that committed
21:06 it that day in September in 2000 bunch
21:09 of these ffs that are all around the
21:12 world they're telling you how it went
21:15 and what's interesting is is you're okay
21:18 with everyone else's religion going away
21:21 except your own and so if you have one
21:26 that perhaps you identify with perhaps
21:28 it is something that you have believed
21:30 your entire life told by those who
21:33 committed the conspiracy themselves the
21:37 Occam's razor in a conspiracy realm is
21:39 so that you can shave off all of the
21:43 emotion this is irrational that has
21:45 nothing to do with fact did you ever you
21:48 ever play the situation I've had this
21:49 happen several times there's two people
21:51 got married long time ago
21:53 your grandparents someone else's
21:55 grandparents some celebrity someone in
21:58 history and then someone asks this
22:01 interesting question well did they love
22:05 each other but it's long gone they're
22:08 both gone and trying to answer that
22:11 question is really tough sometimes how
22:13 would you prove that someone loves
22:15 someone else but we're asking an
22:19 emotional question one that gives us
22:21 sort of a flavor all right so you might
22:26 try to find a love letter depending on
22:29 what year they died maybe a voicemail
22:34 some item they may have made the other
22:35 person in conspiracies we try too hard I
22:40 think to romanticize up intent all we
22:50 really need to know is who did what when
22:52 and how was it legal and does it match
22:55 the history that we were told and did
22:58 anyone get hurt either during their
23:01 lifetime or posthumously seen justice
23:04 for what they did Gus Grissom I
23:08 mentioned him all the time he and his
23:09 two buddies were murdered on the tarmac
23:11 a part of Apollo 1 first they were gas
23:15 was cyanide and they were burned up okay
23:19 that's what the official report says we
23:22 had a guy come and argue with me about
23:23 this you know he didn't look up
23:28 photographs of the bodies that are in
23:31 the Apollo 1 and he was lecturing me
23:33 about what happened bart sibrel who's
23:38 read the 10 inch thick report this is
23:41 not a joke
23:41 knows the wife knows the son of the
23:44 Grissom family he's been in the thick of
23:47 it and some gal argue with him about
23:49 what what really went down because he's
23:51 butthurt and why is he butthurt because
23:54 he hasn't applied to Occam's razor
23:55 what should I did it again right there
23:57 oh my god the Occam's razor to the
24:01 conspiracy of Gus Carson being murdered
24:03 he wasn't gonna go along with the moon
24:06 hoax god bless him Gus Grissom met his
24:10 god an honest man
24:14 what about you Michael Collins buzz rest
24:19 y'all guess there's only eight surviving
24:21 astronauts as of this moment right now
24:23 let's see if we can get to July 16th I'm
24:28 gonna I'm gonna put money down right now
24:29 buzz is gonna be gone by the 16th it's
24:33 only a few months away do I wish him to
24:35 be gone hell no III hope he lives to be
24:39 a hundred and ten [ __ ] years old and
24:41 he tells the truth and he's just make a
24:46 new bronze statue for buzz for
24:48 the truth he and bart sibrel have dinner
24:51 together and shake hands and hug that's
24:54 what i want to see let me get back on
24:57 point here for one second sorry I'm all
25:00 over the place sometimes at this point
25:04 we have I think more credible
25:11 conspiracies going around than ever
25:13 before good solid conspiracies now we
25:17 have some that are just bizarre I mean
25:21 I'll give you three examples so we can
25:23 see the spectrum in my and these in my
25:25 opinion the 17 movement is the most
25:28 credible well researched set of
25:34 conspiracies I think on deck right now
25:36 deep state 5 i stuff previous
25:40 administration of the United States of
25:42 America engaging in all kinds of
25:45 conspiracies with another previous
25:49 member of another administration in the
25:54 middle we might have flat earth round
25:56 earth and again round folks need to
26:02 understand that they're supposedly over
26:04 a thousand geocentric orbit satellites
26:06 in space far enough away from the earth
26:09 that the whole earth should be an any
26:10 shot no problem again if you just
26:14 convert miles or a thousands of miles to
26:17 feet the earth is approximately eight
26:21 feet wide and these cameras are products
26:24 mately thirty-two feet away or more
26:25 that's plenty of plenty of room to shoot
26:28 the earth in a perfect ball but we don't
26:31 get those photos not without a bunch of
26:35 fakery in them you know people think
26:38 they've seen rotational shots of earth
26:40 far away and you know the whole thing
26:45 and then we start seeing the fact that
26:47 the the weather storms over 24 hour
26:49 period never rotated on the surface of
26:51 the planet we find weather storms that
26:54 have been literally cut and pasted like
26:55 Photoshop brush technology and just for
26:58 those of you don't understand that in
27:00 Photoshop you can grab any
27:01 any part of the canvas just draw a
27:03 circle and say that's my brush so you
27:06 could take my mouth and make it a brush
27:08 I put mouths all over the screen well
27:10 they just grab one storm from over here
27:12 and they just but didn't make three or
27:13 four in a row and the average eye on a
27:15 glance can't see it once you pay
27:17 attention you're like oh my god this is
27:19 a fake shot flat fighters folks they're
27:22 trying they're trying to come up with
27:24 something that every human being can do
27:26 in the living room to prove it to
27:27 themselves besides just simply saying
27:29 you don't feel like you're spinning d
27:31 needs to be better noon on the way other
27:35 side of what I think is plausibility
27:39 it's stuff like JonBenet Ramsey being
27:42 Lady Gaga I'll think Jill for that one
27:47 seems like everybody who believes that
27:49 geometry Ramsey still alive is thinking
27:52 this kitty purry I think it looks a hell
27:55 of a lot more like Katy Perry than Lady
27:56 gaga this spirit cooking devil
28:00 worshipping Perry and Gaga are part of
28:03 the same camp so you never know maybe
28:05 there's some wild and sexual thing
28:07 that's a part of that game but now what
28:12 if something in the more abstract realm
28:17 of conspiracy where it's really you know
28:21 nearly impossible to prove manages to
28:26 get enough people together to start
28:29 going after another group of people who
28:32 didn't commit any conspiracy at all or
28:34 maybe they did a conspiracy but it's not
28:37 anything that would be angering anyone
28:40 it's just a difference of opinion it's
28:43 not even radical it's not even someone
28:47 saying that God hates gays or something
28:50 crazy like that and they run off and
28:53 they start doing things like being like
28:55 the Crusades like the Inquisition's
28:59 hurting people we're starting to see it
29:01 you know we've seen it now for a year
29:03 with the mega hats and you know these
29:07 these people that just don't get it it's
29:10 funny you know everyone who's trying to
29:12 punch a mag a hat person I'd be
29:14 interested interest
29:15 you know if they had a gun against their
29:17 head tell me about the 17 movement tell
29:20 me about what's really going on in the
29:22 world tell me what I think tell me what
29:24 you think I think is going on in the
29:25 world and see if they can even come up
29:26 with a paragraph we know from just the
29:31 17 movement that we have a lot of very
29:35 very disenfranchised very unhappy people
29:39 because the world sucks for them the
29:42 economy sucks for them and you can
29:47 sympathize with them right away now what
29:51 I don't understand is I know a lot of
29:52 celebrities that are very wealthy
29:54 they'll never worry about anything and
29:56 they're somehow just as upset as people
29:59 who are 25 years old with no to dwell
30:02 with a degree $100,000 in jet debt and
30:05 there are baristas somewhere that person
30:09 has a reason to be really unhappy but
30:13 for whatever reason sometimes people are
30:15 very upset with their life because of
30:18 something personal they're tremendously
30:22 successful by anyone's standards but for
30:25 them it's not enough there's something
30:28 else missing and other people are just
30:32 triggered by folks that feel like other
30:36 folks like I've said in the past I think
30:39 that the president States triggers some
30:41 females you've always felt threatened or
30:47 insecure maybe for very legitimate
30:49 reasons someone in their past look like
30:52 that guy sounded like that guy acted
30:54 like that guy but they were a perv like
30:57 Joe Biden touching them and breathing on
31:01 their [ __ ] neck and petting their
31:02 hair and touching their boobs and all
31:04 this other stuff
31:04 unauthorized so they here that used car
31:09 salesmen voice in their head and like
31:11 that's a used car salesman he lies he
31:14 steals he nothing he says it's the truth
31:17 and he doesn't care and in my mind
31:20 meaning their mind the used-car salesman
31:23 goes to bed with no ulcers no problem
31:29 we're not gonna trust karma to fix the
31:30 problem but anyone acts like that person
31:34 is exactly like the other person and can
31:36 you imagine that same application being
31:39 applied to the person who's doing it -
31:41 perhaps Donald Trump when they happened
31:46 to sound like someone else everyone in
31:49 the room mob rules and and banishes them
31:56 from the village it's scary to think
32:00 that it could get out of control I saw a
32:04 really really weird cringe video the
32:07 other day and this one kid I don't know
32:10 where he is he was abused when he was
32:15 younger because his cringe videos go
32:17 back almost 10 years I think if not more
32:22 this kid was a redhead he was a redhead
32:24 I'm it sounds like he has a really good
32:27 soul because he he can barely swear even
32:31 in his most recent video he had a really
32:33 hard time using foul language but he
32:37 really wanted to and every time I see
32:39 that I think wow that's that's a good
32:41 soul that's been corrupted you know it's
32:43 been angered and abused and what had
32:46 happened was in his personal life
32:48 people were saying all the redhead jokes
32:51 which I never heard a redhead joke even
32:56 when I lived in Massachusetts and every
32:58 other person was red or brown hair right
33:00 they were either an Irish person or a
33:02 Jewish person and it's barely an
33:04 exaggeration and I thought was cool was
33:07 like oh that's cool you know it didn't
33:09 have a lot of this when I was at home
33:10 you guys talking to different accents
33:11 you have different cultural norms when I
33:13 go home and my Jewish buddies had this
33:16 rich Jewish culture at home I went to
33:18 the Irish kids houses and they were
33:20 totally into the whole patch st. Patty's
33:22 Day and it was it was 365 all year long
33:24 right believe it or not but this kid was
33:27 abused and they were saying a bunch of
33:29 stuff to him she made like several dozen
33:31 videos selfie videos of himself
33:33 defending himself which broke my heart
33:36 when I first saw his videos because he
33:38 was abused you didn't deserve that
33:42 I mean sometimes kids can be cruel in
33:45 now psychologically anyone who's abusing
33:48 that kid is really projecting their own
33:50 problem but he's too young to know that
33:53 at the time now he's grown up now he's
33:57 been going to the gym I couldn't believe
33:59 I saw a new video of him and it's in a
34:02 cringe compilation and he is trying to
34:05 call out someone on the internet who
34:09 continues to abuse him but the
34:12 interesting thing was the kid took a
34:13 political affiliation for the very first
34:15 time ever and I don't know how big the
34:18 kid is he looks huge in this video I
34:20 mean looks like it's muscularly gigantic
34:23 and he's in a gym all by himself
34:24 some sort of CrossFit kind of place you
34:31 know and for about 2/3 of this video
34:33 he's yelling and screaming at the camera
34:35 challenging this dude to a fight needs
34:37 to stop being a [ __ ] trying to fight
34:39 you you know I want my fight you said we
34:41 could fight and I don't know anything
34:43 about this whole background maybe some
34:45 of you do but then the last third of his
34:47 rant was all about the fact that he's a
34:50 Democrat and he hates Magga people and
34:53 you know he's tired of being made fun of
34:56 cuz he's a Democrat and you know he's
34:57 trying to defend his friends he's trying
34:59 to like create this his friends aren't
35:01 anywhere around him right but he's
35:02 trying to defend his friends online sort
35:04 of do the virtue signal thing still he
35:06 can barely cuss he's he's a nice kid
35:08 inside which is good but what do
35:12 Democrats do what I mean what is the DNC
35:14 do I shouldn't say Democrats they were
35:15 kinds of normal people just a slightly
35:18 different differing opinion but the
35:20 party itself is trying to create those
35:22 kids trying to create that sense of
35:25 disenfranchisement you know you're lost
35:27 right no one likes you what we like you
35:30 and if you just vote for us everything
35:31 will come your way that's their game
35:33 it's an old game and it's it's not
35:36 working anymore here's this kid on a
35:39 video threatening somebody else I don't
35:44 know what the other guy looks like but I
35:45 would tell you that if this kid to learn
35:48 how to fight the other dude would
35:50 definitely need to be a big guy to
35:52 defend himself because this kid's gonna
35:55 rushon it just would be the case right
35:57 we have heard countless stories that are
36:03 true about crazies in the world in the
36:07 United States of America who fall in
36:11 love with celebrities usually women and
36:15 they will show up in Hollywood and
36:18 attempt to sneak into there well first
36:22 they try to engage them find him in a
36:25 hotel lobby something like that
36:27 luckily there's usually bodyguards
36:29 around and these poor women are just
36:31 trying to give these guys away from them
36:32 but not let them know that that's what
36:34 they're trying to do until someone can
36:35 come help them and they break into
36:38 people's houses remember George Harris
36:40 from the Beatles had people break into
36:41 his house LL Cool J's had people
36:43 breaking news house I don't think they
36:44 knew yellow will live there at the time
36:46 that's for sure yes to beat the living
36:49 shadow this guy but some of them have
36:52 shown up and they believe that these
36:53 people are sorry these individuals
36:57 there's one case where this woman I
36:59 think she survived but he showed up
37:03 there's a whole series there's a sorry
37:05 that I made for TV movie about her I
37:07 think if maybe it was just a movie but
37:09 the dude showed up and he was [ __ ]
37:11 totally crazy he thought that an angel
37:13 had told him to kill this person and
37:18 she's trying to get in their car as I
37:19 remember it I could have the story wrong
37:21 but I think that's what it was and this
37:23 crazy bastard starts stabbing her broad
37:26 daylight I think if I remember it right
37:31 she was stabbed over 40 times and she
37:33 lived this crazy [ __ ]
37:38 came from somewhere else in the United
37:41 States of America hell he may have come
37:42 from another country as far as I know I
37:43 don't remember and he destroys this
37:47 woman's life he injures her beyond
37:50 belief can you imagine the psychological
37:55 damage of just going to your car and
37:58 some crazy bastard comes out of nowhere
38:01 and starts stabbing you how you gonna
38:04 hate gonna feel normal after that
38:07 every time you go to your car you're
38:09 gonna have this memory of this total
38:11 crazy person how you gonna convince
38:14 yourself it's never gonna happen again
38:15 her career most likely destroyed it's
38:19 gonna be recovering for a long time she
38:21 has this guy on her because she was a
38:24 celebrity and she was pretty and somehow
38:27 he was some crazy nut bag it used to be
38:31 that these individuals were more
38:33 singular and now we know that there's
38:38 always been little secret groups I've
38:40 talked about him several times recently
38:42 especially in the group think tank thing
38:44 the group think people like George Soros
38:49 used to fund this kind of stuff didn't
38:50 he you know I haven't seen a live shot
38:53 of that guy since October 2018 so maybe
38:57 he's alive maybe he's not okay so let's
39:00 go to the next stage now let's say we
39:04 all got together on this patio we went
39:06 to our University we're in a think tank
39:08 little us spin-off think tank to make
39:11 sure that those that are seeking truth
39:13 don't lose sight of what we're really
39:15 trying to do which is improve humanity
39:18 if our golden rule is do no harm
39:22 then anyone that is brought inside of a
39:25 truth envelope a know great awakening
39:26 movement it's it's almost as if they
39:30 need to sign the inside of our Great
39:33 Awakening book which says you know a
39:35 common law is do no harm it's like an
39:38 big bold writing and you need to sign
39:41 your name just like when you join the
39:42 latter-day saints the Mormon they make
39:45 you sign the inside of your book of
39:47 Mormon to certify that you believe this
39:49 is true for me I think that's a heavy
39:53 concern that they know it's not true and
39:55 they're trying to get you to sign that
39:57 it is true just self indoctrinations
40:00 brilliant on their part if we could get
40:04 everybody on that one page before they
40:06 take action how would it modify what
40:09 we're thinking about today what do you
40:12 do with the Jeffrey Epstein hmm what do
40:16 you do with people that are responsible
40:17 for lots of people dying in this world
40:20 like wherever they go and whoever knows
40:23 them whoever is in a first-degree circle
40:26 with them miraculously dies and then
40:30 it's ruled a suicide if that person has
40:34 ever investigated or there's ever even a
40:35 rumor being investigated that person
40:37 dies now what do we do with I do no
40:41 harm' mantra in my opinion you apply
40:46 rule of law especially those that are
40:49 held in place by something like the
40:52 Constitution of the United States that
40:53 perhaps the original Magna Carta after
40:56 someone is dead there's not a whole lot
41:00 you can do about it right and that's why
41:03 I think that due process is extremely
41:08 important for a society to reflect upon
41:10 what that society is there's that old
41:14 saying if you don't know where you've
41:15 been you don't know where you're going
41:18 they say it the other way around but you
41:22 have to have an identity one of the huge
41:25 identity crises that we have the United
41:27 States of America is the utter
41:28 obliteration of the Native Americans now
41:33 one part of my family has been here long
41:36 enough to have been present during the
41:39 entire extermination process none of
41:43 them have from my inner stain and that
41:46 side of the family served in any
41:48 military capacity to participate in that
41:52 sort of thing until much later after
41:54 that change had been made they were
41:57 actually working fields and and you know
42:00 getting off plantations believe it or
42:02 not but it haunts every American you
42:05 have to look in your past to go okay why
42:07 don't I migrate here like one of my
42:08 families I got four families that I'm
42:10 immediately related to and then we have
42:12 to look in their past weight to try to
42:13 find out what boats that came over what
42:15 time that came over so we can absolve
42:16 our own personal genetics for
42:18 participating in this thing but
42:20 regardless were still benefiting from
42:22 the event hmm that's rough in it now
42:28 some people obviously have a lot more
42:30 evidence we believe
42:33 that certifies their bad deeds but still
42:38 I'm trying to say this as symbolic as
42:41 possible as to not one commits a felony
42:44 and two to reveal what's going on but
42:49 let's just say we can all put it in our
42:52 mind one or two individuals that have
42:56 been in politics that we believe are
42:58 responsible for dozens and dozens of
43:00 people within their circle dying now
43:03 people if there's a a president or a
43:07 politician that participates in
43:09 instigating a war like John McCain since
43:12 he's dead now we could acknowledge the
43:14 fact that he helped put together Isis we
43:17 believe we have dozens and dozens of
43:19 photographs of him hanging out with all
43:20 the leaders that are now on the top ten
43:23 top 20 list of Isis guys that were
43:25 trying to kill he's sitting there
43:28 partying with them broad daylight HD
43:31 cameras posing with him what the hell
43:33 was the point of that
43:34 that's not very smart is it they never
43:37 thought she lose right but without
43:40 evidence for any one of these
43:42 individuals that I mean hardcore
43:44 red-handed evidence which we can then
43:47 after they pass which by whatever means
43:51 that especially if we engage in some
43:53 form of lynching we can take the book
43:58 open it up and go here's all the facts
44:01 here's all the proof it's three or four
44:04 layers deep so it's everything we're
44:07 claiming is confirmed and confirmed and
44:09 confirmed at least at that point if we
44:13 look back on someone who's no longer in
44:14 this world and we participated in the
44:19 instigation of their demise we can kind
44:23 of go okay at least that one looks like
44:25 if we're going to engage in capital
44:27 punishment then maybe there's a way to
44:32 live with ourselves if we happen to
44:34 doubt capital punishment at a future
44:35 time but there are a lot of people in
44:40 this world that are being accused of
44:41 things which they may be guilty of
44:44 and as much as we believe the sources
44:47 that we have maybe those just maybe that
44:50 maybe that's just not a process that's
44:51 good enough people used to believe the
44:53 press and now we know the press lies we
44:56 found out about Project Mockingbird
44:58 where intelligence agencies brought in a
45:00 bunch of shills
45:01 and installed them all over the place
45:03 now if you can find a legitimate
45:06 journalist you're a miracle worker and
45:09 that's why the press is you and the
45:12 press is me and we pass it around we
45:16 think about it I'm I don't do any you
45:18 know gumshoe work I don't go around and
45:21 investigate things with my own eyeballs
45:24 and feed half the time because I'm stuck
45:26 where I'm stuck I do rely on some
45:29 eyewitnesses who were at particular FF
45:33 events who for whatever a miracle reason
45:36 end up in my circle and I could sit down
45:38 and talk to them for an entire evening
45:40 we're talking four or five hours there
45:44 was an event that happened in Las Vegas
45:46 I have now discussed the event with
45:49 three people who were there and they're
45:52 definitely well the funny thing was that
45:55 they weren't aware of the accusations of
45:59 it being an FF but then when we said
46:03 well okay could you please watch this
46:04 video that this person is hurting this
46:06 and let me know if there's any makes any
46:08 sense to you but luckily two of them one
46:13 in particular of the two gave us all the
46:15 empirical evidence that we needed to
46:18 hear they were on the ground they were
46:21 in the middle of it and it happened to
46:23 match a lot of these videos that are out
46:26 talking about that particular event
46:28 there's the the age-old phrase
46:34 history is written by the victors only
46:38 that makes me really concerned those
46:43 that are left those that didn't die
46:45 those that weren't murdered are capable
46:48 of swaying reality now maybe a situation
46:55 is so mutually horrible
46:57 all sides are so mutually guilty of
47:00 things you know in a war occurs no no
47:04 okay so let's just say you have in a
47:09 fantasy world you have a nation of fifty
47:14 million fighting a nation of fifty
47:16 million fighting a nation of fifty
47:17 million fighting a nation of fifty
47:18 million it's it's a bloodbath well
47:23 what's going to be the body count of the
47:25 victor they are going to have killed
47:29 most likely more people than the losers
47:34 okay so technically on paper if death is
47:39 something that we put people away for
47:40 well they've committed more crimes than
47:43 the other side but what makes that
47:46 Victor okay in the world history because
47:52 they frame what they did as a positive
47:55 and they frame what the other folks did
47:58 as a negative that's the only way you
48:01 can approach history if you don't want
48:03 to have some wild guilt-ridden
48:06 self-loathing when I studied the and
48:09 discovered and studied the Japanese
48:11 artist Murakami this dude is wild man I
48:16 went to the MOCA here in Los Angeles and
48:19 it was 2007 saw his installation my mind
48:23 was all over the floor it was like blown
48:25 to pieces and then it took me another
48:28 year of investigating who this guy was
48:31 to understand what I was looking at and
48:36 he says Japanese artist that makes art
48:39 out of two different things one he makes
48:43 art out of atomic bomb shapes so he does
48:48 the big he does these his own custom
48:50 mushroom which is his homage to a
48:54 mushroom cloud of Hiroshima or Nagasaki
48:56 but embedded in that he will put like
49:00 cherub you know babies and stuff coming
49:03 out of it in some cases sometimes it's
49:05 this he has created his own
49:08 well you know what I actually if you Nev
49:13 you've seen this little button you
49:15 probably can't see it at night here but
49:17 I got this da button that I wear on this
49:20 jacket you've seen it through all the
49:21 shows when I wear this jacket
49:22 that's a Murakami button that is his
49:25 version of Mickey Mouse turned into kind
49:29 of like this he's an oddball shape dude
49:33 he's got a razor teeth and that's his
49:37 way of saying commercialism is evil
49:40 commercialism indoctrinates things but
49:44 he does all these really cute things
49:46 tons of cute like he has a whole room
49:50 that are like daisies he's beautiful
49:52 like I don't even know it's really
49:53 really Daisy but it's like multicolored
49:54 flowers everywhere it looks really you
49:58 know like you could take your daughter
49:59 in there and she'd just be like oh my
50:01 god I want my room to look like this
50:02 daddy
50:04 he's also got adult content like crazy
50:07 in his installation so you got to be
50:09 careful taking your kid in this thing
50:11 I've talked about a long time ago I
50:12 can't remember what episode but he was a
50:14 guy that said look after World War two
50:18 he said that the world war two you know
50:21 which had kamikazes and you know these
50:23 dudes fought valiantly for what they
50:26 thought was right and who knows what was
50:29 right because we wrote the history books
50:31 about the whole thing we owned the
50:32 Hollywood machine which pounded them
50:34 into the ground as the pardon the phrase
50:36 the Japs I have to say I've said this a
50:41 long time ago there wasn't a lot of
50:44 racism in my hometown when I was a kid
50:46 but the one thing I heard all the time
50:49 was Japs jab jab jab jab jab and I
50:54 didn't have any context for cuz I didn't
50:56 know any Japanese people I don't think
50:58 I'd even met an Asian person until I
50:59 went to the big city which my father
51:01 loved Asian food and so we go to these
51:04 really nice restaurants and I was like
51:05 oh yeah I see him on TV all the time but
51:09 Murakami said that the nation of the
51:11 citizens of Japan were actually
51:13 extremely embarrassed about having been
51:17 the aggressors that and and I've heard
51:20 his spoken several times
51:22 read it in books about the atomic bomb
51:24 and all this other stuff
51:25 Murakami put it down he said look Japan
51:30 started trying to be as cute as possible
51:33 after the war to erase this notion that
51:36 we were the aggressors that we would
51:38 even remotely lie to someone and say you
51:42 know being a kamikaze pilot was gonna
51:44 put you at an upper echelon place in the
51:47 afterlife of some sort I've always heard
51:50 it blamed on the Emperor and the
51:52 military generals they were the ones
51:54 that kept the war going and of course at
51:58 one point they were actually backed by
51:59 Hitler himself and so you know there you
52:02 felt like they had the juice they felt
52:03 like they were gonna get backed up Pearl
52:06 Harbor was fully instigated sobbing what
52:08 the hell was that all about I mean could
52:09 you quick could you possibly think you
52:11 know Roosevelt's making a phone call to
52:14 the Emperor of China and got hurt I'm
52:16 sorry Japan and he's saying yeah I'm
52:18 gonna clean on all these Navy fleets you
52:20 just come down don't bomb to deep inside
52:21 the island cuz we don't what you bomb on
52:23 our manufacturing facilities but you can
52:24 take all the boats and we got soldiers
52:26 in there don't worry it'll be plenty of
52:28 casualties that'll be our you know
52:30 moment that lives on in infamy
52:32 but Japan tried to undo this negative
52:37 conspiracy to create war so there wasn't
52:40 this prolonged hatred for the people of
52:44 Japan and you know I never in any one
52:48 really comment about their long-term
52:49 evolution after 45 you know my family or
52:54 my family's friends or whatever they're
52:56 older I've never heard anyone say well
52:57 you know we hated Japanese people for
52:59 this long and then it you know it all
53:00 calmed down never anyone seeing that
53:03 kind of stuff
53:03 hopefully it never was necessary you
53:05 know whenever went through that but
53:07 there was a an interesting Twilight Zone
53:10 which of course is a fictional show but
53:13 the gentleman who played what is it
53:15 George I want to say his last name right
53:19 it's either too high or Takei I know
53:21 that Shatner says are wrong and it's
53:23 that gentleman who paid Sulu he was in a
53:28 Twilight Zone where I think he was a
53:30 postman or something and he was I think
53:33 anyway he caught this guy in the attic
53:35 of his house
53:36 he wasn't opposed my camera was but this
53:39 racist white guy he was in the Attic of
53:41 his house and he had fought in World War
53:43 two he's probably in his like late 40s
53:46 at the time and this is the early 60s
53:49 between 59 and 64 it was all about this
53:54 racism this guy could not undo the
53:57 racism that he had and he had stolen
53:59 this samurai sword when he was over
54:01 there something that was very common
54:03 among soldiers and it ticked off the
54:07 Sulu character but I think that I think
54:08 the show is that if you touch the sword
54:10 he kind of regressed back to the guy who
54:12 owned the sword and so they got this big
54:14 violent fight going on in the Attic and
54:16 I can't remember how it ended not one of
54:19 my favorite episodes but we are dealing
54:22 with sort of in some of these
54:25 conspiracies powder keg after powder keg
54:28 after powder keg how infuriating does it
54:32 make some of you to think about Lolita
54:34 Island existing and all these kids that
54:36 were pushed through that Island that's
54:37 the story anyway I wasn't there the
54:41 guy's been charged over and over and
54:43 over for those type of human trafficking
54:46 charges prostitution charges child
54:48 trafficking charge of child prostitution
54:50 guy gets off every single time he's
54:52 about to go into court again of course
54:53 the DNC folks they're trying to make
54:55 sure that his court case isn't televised
54:57 because they feel like they got too many
54:59 members from their party will show up in
55:02 the rosters some of you guys and gals
55:06 out there you're the alpha breed of our
55:08 species and you're you're ready to take
55:11 action physically to get rid of these
55:13 people all over the world to make sure
55:14 they don't get away one more time we got
55:17 to be careful because a lot of
55:20 conspiracies do bring up these emotions
55:22 how many times have I read that the
55:26 astronauts of NASA should be dumped into
55:28 a hole and buried that's pretty harsh
55:32 man they are just the passengers they
55:35 were the threatened are you sure after
55:40 watching Gus Grissom die in 1965 I
55:42 believe four years later they're coming
55:45 to you and saying well you know you know
55:47 what happened to Gus right and if you
55:49 don't go along with this
55:50 we've done it too we kill Gus we killed
55:53 JFK RFK MLK Malcolm X we paralyze one of
56:00 Nixon's you know opponents you're
56:04 nothing man you're so easy to kill your
56:08 kids are so easy to kill your wife is so
56:10 easy to kill you mean to tell me you got
56:13 the balls to say well [ __ ] it go ahead
56:16 I'm gonna live for the American Way and
56:19 all this other stuff maybe maybe you
56:23 don't have any significant others at
56:24 this point your life and so you have a
56:25 big stance you could make your parents
56:29 are gone
56:29 you have no brothers and sisters you
56:32 don't have a loved one and so it is just
56:34 you and so you can you can take that
56:36 position good for you second you fall in
56:39 love second you have a kid I think the
56:43 game changes it would seem as though our
56:46 friend Alex Jones has capitulated down
56:49 to his the controlling forces he's now
56:53 taking this plea that he was in a
56:57 psychosis of sorts which is why he was
57:00 doubting one of the ffs from actually
57:03 being true meanwhile more photos are
57:05 coming into these kids he's still being
57:07 alive nuts but he's got kids then you
57:12 have three from his first wife and one
57:13 from his new wife he's a target now he
57:19 still needs to be famous he still needs
57:21 to be out there maybe they got to him
57:23 maybe they got to him in 2010 when his
57:25 production went 24 hours and he stopped
57:27 making movies brothers gaining weight
57:31 like crazy and he what makes you do that
57:34 usually stress I think the guy's gonna
57:38 die of a heart attack and I don't even
57:40 I'm not even joking and I do not wish
57:43 that upon him in any way shape or form
57:46 in a way I hope he's like a 17 operative
57:49 just trying to get things in Discovery
57:51 but it didn't go the way I thought it
57:53 was gonna go the thing they kicked this
57:56 off is a bunch of lighter conspiracies
58:01 the people seem to gain get really
58:03 passionate
58:04 motional about and sometimes show very
58:10 clear indicators of violent thought
58:13 process and maybe just simply vocalizing
58:17 a violent outburst for an individual
58:20 gets that outside them like I've told
58:23 you was guys several times if you really
58:25 have a an issue you need to resolve with
58:27 someone go talk to yourself somewhere
58:29 and pretend like you're talking to them
58:30 and be as visceral as you can get it all
58:33 out of your system say all those
58:35 horrible words you would never say to
58:36 the other person so you don't say on to
58:39 them and you get it out of your system
58:40 and you see how silly you look so you
58:42 can reset yourself the problem is is in
58:45 a social media realm and in a conspiracy
58:49 room you might be typing it into a
58:54 comment somewhere and just typing into
58:56 the comment clears your consciousness
58:58 you're like ah you know I I guess I
59:01 don't feel that way anymore and I'll
59:03 tell you today
59:04 our moderator one of our moderators can
59:09 attest to this he'll know I'm talking
59:12 about he posted a video that was
59:14 infuriating if you don't like your kids
59:18 being vaccinated and I posted a really
59:22 really intense comment about how I would
59:26 react to my kids being forced at
59:28 gunpoint extracted from my house by
59:33 quote-unquote law enforcement to go take
59:38 these vaccinations but later I deleted
59:41 it because I was like wait a minute and
59:43 I went way overboard
59:44 I totally communicated what I would most
59:47 likely do in this situation but that
59:50 situation is not gonna happen to me
59:51 anymore I don't have any kids that need
59:52 to be vaccinated there are many young
59:54 children in my life but I don't want
59:57 that to trigger somebody else
59:59 necessarily you know we how many of you
60:03 have heard I'll just give this example
60:06 in closing how many of you heard the
60:09 whole the Western stories of concrete in
60:14 the United States of America now from
60:15 Kansas
60:16 I'm one of the most notorious cities of
60:19 the Wild Wild West Was Dodge City now I
60:22 grew up thinking that that was the worst
60:24 city and I don't maybe it was but
60:27 tombstone seemed pretty bad
60:29 Deadwood seemed pretty bad and not just
60:31 because Hollywood tended to focus on
60:33 those cities because when you study
60:35 history it's like yeah they saw some
60:37 serious stuff you know tombstone had the
60:39 OK Corral shootout Deadwood was you know
60:43 nuts I mean the stuff that was going on
60:45 there on a daily basis was really hard
60:48 to imagine but you think about these
60:51 locations and you think to yourself well
60:53 jeez how what would have been like you
60:56 know a part of me just wants to go back
60:57 in time then just roll into one of these
61:00 towns and go to a saloon and get a drink
61:03 and just see how fast it it would occur
61:08 to someone else to get in my face just
61:12 see is it 10 minutes 10 days does it
61:14 never happen is that all [ __ ] I
61:17 think it'd be fascinating to everyone
61:20 walk around with the chip on their
61:21 shoulder when I was in my hometown back
61:24 in the day I there were definitely a
61:27 couple crazy guys I mean [ __ ] nuts
61:30 they would just walk around and their
61:31 eyes were narrow as [ __ ] and they were
61:33 just my god they just they saw you as a
61:37 half like if you were good looking they
61:40 thought they were not good looking and
61:42 so they would just come after you and
61:44 boy you had to stay on your own and as
61:47 soon as you stood your ground usually
61:49 they'd run their mouth a little bit they
61:52 knew they couldn't fight that's the
61:54 funny thing
61:54 that one kid I think knew how to fight
61:56 but you scrawny it was funny I went back
62:00 to my hometown I don't know which which
62:03 event I'm one of these guys is running a
62:05 he's a clerk at this just cool little
62:10 warehouse and he had they were selling
62:12 like swisher Sweets I couldn't get any
62:14 cigars of my own down so I was like just
62:16 don't want any work you find something
62:17 that wasn't gonna be a cigarette and he
62:21 and I had the most daring conversation
62:23 he couldn't really remember he could
62:25 kind of remember main you we just
62:27 laughed it off just being kids and being
62:29 stupid
62:30 I saw him four or five times and we just
62:31 kind of became friends but now take that
62:36 Wild West analogy and bring it back or
62:38 bring it forward excuse me to the truth
62:41 movement well we're trying to keep the
62:44 internet pretty freedom of speech but
62:47 these corporations are going nuts trying
62:48 to censor the [ __ ] out of us Mark
62:51 Zuckerberg
62:52 you know of all people is now trying to
62:54 seek help from Europe to censor America
62:58 wow dude Wow
63:02 you better [ __ ] own some pretty good
63:04 property in New Zealand buddy you have
63:08 that private jet filled up at all times
63:10 buddy I think the truth movement is
63:14 fairly Wild Wild West right now and
63:18 think about it the community of Deadwood
63:23 South Dakota went into the valley of
63:26 Deadwood so they could get away from the
63:30 rule of law from the United States of
63:32 America because it was Sioux Nation
63:34 territory and everything that was Native
63:37 American territory was protected from US
63:40 law cuz it was Native American territory
63:42 but of course the government was trying
63:44 to kill off all the Native Americans
63:46 fast enough to say well it's no longer
63:48 Sioux territory because the zoo's don't
63:49 exist anymore or they exist in such
63:51 futile numbers they don't need this big
63:53 allocation of land thus usurp the land
63:56 we insert the laws boom you can't have
63:59 all this profiteering that you had
64:02 previously because it's a big gold
64:04 mining town they lost it
64:07 Bitcoin same exact thing Wild West for a
64:10 little while everyone has a beautiful
64:12 currency and then the was that the sec
64:17 got in regulated the [ __ ] out of it took
64:21 it over boom gone we already know we're
64:24 getting shadow ban like crazy most of
64:28 you picked up on the fact that this
64:29 channel should probably have a hell of a
64:31 lot more subscribers maybe not a
64:32 millionaire or something crazy like that
64:33 but we should have a lot more those of
64:36 you pass it around on a chain and all
64:38 these other boards I appreciate it
64:40 hopefully the information is still
64:42 valuable the more you
64:43 back in time so hopefully this is some
64:47 food for thought I don't know how much
64:49 any one of us individually can inspire
64:51 other people to do what we're saying
64:54 probably the only thing we can do is
64:56 live by example I would say that if you
65:00 see a group getting out of control
65:06 maybe at that point something can be
65:09 done to sort of add perspective from
65:12 this episode I'll pass this episode
65:13 directly to them if they'll watch it I'd
65:17 be interested in your comments on this
65:19 whole thing it's a really important
65:22 subject unfortunately a lot of folks
65:25 will skip over these kind of episodes
65:27 because they don't have that big poppa
65:29 lure of some big agenda or something by
65:35 the way just want to put a plug in for
65:38 the new channel that is the remastered
65:41 season one so I'm going through these
65:45 old season 1 episodes and aside from
65:48 having the mic about an inch from my
65:50 mouth I think the content is actually
65:54 very strong I was actually pretty
65:55 surprised how quick I got going if you
65:59 see the dates that I'm now putting on
66:00 the episode so you know what day they
66:02 were recorded because I want people to
66:04 understand if they come new to that
66:05 channel that these are old episodes but
66:07 the contents actually very very valid
66:10 definitely go back and take a look at
66:14 those videos I've cleaned up the audio
66:18 tracks of getting rid of again all the
66:20 custom music so sometimes you're gonna
66:21 go into these episodes you're gonna hear
66:23 a little blip of the music that was
66:24 inserted on the front only if I talked
66:27 on top of the music as the episode
66:29 started I'm also balancing all the
66:32 volume levels so forth a lot of you that
66:34 said man I like your episodes but I try
66:36 to go to sleep to them and the music's
66:39 really loud then your vocals really low
66:40 and then the music blows my mind up at
66:43 the end hopefully by at least episode 25
66:48 or so I've been using I've been getting
66:51 a lot better at Adobe Audition
66:52 and I found a really cool feature they
66:55 have to really balance the
66:57 of spoken language in a way that doesn't
67:00 take all the breathing and mouth noises
67:03 and make them disgusting I don't know if
67:06 you need to subscribe if I'm only at
67:08 episode at the its current recording I
67:10 just finished mastering episode 32 it's
67:14 gonna take me a couple months to
67:16 probably get all 100 remastered so if
67:19 you want to know when that's gonna
67:21 happen for those of you in Europe or
67:23 Isis say outside the United States but
67:26 especially in Europe because you have
67:27 all the copyright laws that prevented my
67:29 episodes from playing outside the United
67:31 States but I think it's actually for
67:32 almost every country outside the United
67:33 States if I use certain music you may
67:37 want to subscribe simply because there's
67:39 gonna be episodes you have never seen
67:41 you can't you couldn't get to them now
67:44 if you're a podcast listener you've
67:46 never had a problem listening to all my
67:47 episodes and if you do go back to the
67:49 podcast version of those first episodes
67:54 you're gonna hear the original music the
67:56 way it was intended I don't know if I'll
67:59 ever roll back and maybe in a year from
68:01 now or so I'll roll back and redo all
68:03 the podcasts of season one on the
68:05 website but I am gonna start replacing
68:07 all of the links to the season one on
68:10 the website to the new channel
68:12 I've already started that a little bit
68:13 which is such a boring process but the
68:19 reason why I mentioned season one is
68:21 that there's a lot of core DNA in that
68:23 first season that I get questions about
68:28 all the time please do an episode on
68:30 this and it's already done and they
68:33 simply can't see it because of the
68:36 copyright problems so anyway I think you
68:38 feel me on that one hopefully this
68:40 episode was valuable to you guys again
68:44 I'm telling you if you guys hang on for
68:47 these one hour episodes plus and you're
68:49 a big listener then I can almost assure
68:52 you you are an engineer of society
68:56 that's your personality whether you can
68:59 talk like I talk or whatever doesn't
69:01 matter you talking different than me
69:03 probably has an extremely powerful value
69:06 to society because you know I keep it
69:09 pretty real in the episode
69:11 I definitely swear too much from time to
69:14 time I do want to make a point that and
69:17 I think I might have made this an
69:18 episode I haven't aired yet so I
69:20 apologize if I'm replicating myself for
69:23 the new listeners who happen to make it
69:25 to the end of this episode I'm getting
69:29 like you know half a dozen comments
69:31 recently because we have several hundred
69:32 new subscribers who are you know
69:34 concerned about the language I do
69:37 apologize if you want to listen to this
69:39 while taking your kids to school and
69:40 it's not really a good good thing to do
69:42 or you just you just love you know harsh
69:47 language one of the reasons why you know
69:51 the season one has very clean language
69:53 to be honest I don't know when it's
69:56 gonna start but I'm at 32 and it's
69:58 pretty clean so far but I used to watch
70:01 Alex Jones and and some other folks on
70:04 YouTube and I would see them get really
70:07 angry at a particular subject and I felt
70:09 like they were holding back what they
70:12 really wanted to say because they're on
70:14 syndicated radio channels which have SCC
70:17 you know regulations against bad
70:20 language and I felt like they weren't
70:27 truly going through the full process of
70:35 healing themselves by letting some of
70:38 that language out letting their emotions
70:40 turn into those words that have been
70:42 invented to to really express themselves
70:46 what I said just recently to listen here
70:48 and I want to thank this listener for
70:50 saying something I can't remember her
70:51 name I think it's a female she means it
70:53 really kind comment about my language
70:56 you know and saying can you can you not
70:58 talk like that I'm not trying to be a
71:02 jerk by saying no I'm not gonna change
71:05 the way I talk the way I see it is this
71:08 there's plenty of clean channels all
71:10 over YouTube all over everything
71:14 but since YouTube is the name of the
71:16 game right now for serving video there
71:19 are a lot of alternatives if you needed
71:21 to be really clean this is a place you
71:23 come to listen to you're in
71:25 sighs and I don't mean to say you're a
71:27 person who swears but these topics we
71:31 discuss several or I should say often
71:36 invoke and instill and manifests serious
71:41 emotional responses at least for me
71:43 personally and there's a lot of you that
71:46 are really funny in your responses like
71:48 dude don't change your language I'm
71:50 gonna cover this a few times maybe like
71:52 every three or four episodes just
71:54 because there's a lot of new listeners
71:55 and that'll be the first episode they
71:57 ever hear and they're like geez man you
71:58 know you're letting it all hang out here
72:00 what are you nuts again like that
72:03 therapy I was telling you about where
72:05 you need to go off and pretend to have
72:07 that conversation with the person you're
72:08 really frustrated with because it will
72:11 teach you how to do it in a much more
72:14 judicious manner right to be really kind
72:17 with your words you could pick simpler
72:19 words I find that when I do have to
72:22 distribute this information in a public
72:23 forum because people are interested like
72:26 a spot of smoke lounge mainly I can be
72:29 so I can so easily recall all the facts
72:35 and all the circumstances in a way that
72:37 I don't get you know riled up personally
72:39 because I've already done it I've
72:41 already blown everything out of my
72:43 system it's just live on this channel so
72:47 to speak oh and another thing a lot of
72:51 you have asked me to do you know live
72:58 sessions with you guys there's a couple
73:01 reasons why I don't want to do that one
73:04 I don't think one I like the
73:06 black-and-white format and I don't know
73:08 any software they can capture this and
73:10 keep it the way I like it too
73:12 I've seen a lot of really popular
73:15 channels that have hundreds of thousands
73:18 of subscribers like over a quarter of a
73:20 million subscribers and they will do
73:22 this live thing and there's like 20
73:25 people and you know most people just
73:27 want to watch they want to participate
73:29 the format is also kind of crappy
73:31 because I all I have in front of me as a
73:34 computer is showing me the Soundwave of
73:36 me recording that's all I've got
73:38 despite rumors that I had a teleprompter
73:40 did you imagine writing this down in
73:41 this script this is Phil scripted to you
73:44 I don't think so
73:46 so I don't like having to look at a
73:48 computer and go okay what are someone
73:51 saying and you know Scrolls too quickly
73:54 to really see what the hell anyone's
73:55 saying so I think the technology
73:57 currently is pretty crappy if I had a
74:00 producer sitting next to me and just
74:03 like a normal radio show they're the one
74:05 coming through the comments and putting
74:07 it up in front of me and a really nice
74:08 easy way to read so I can you know
74:10 respond to it maybe that would work the
74:13 other one is just simply riffing live I
74:16 think is sort of dangerous because
74:18 everything that goes online is permanent
74:20 when I watch these episodes back to the
74:22 best ability I am trying to delete any
74:26 digression that goes totally off rails
74:28 and just like stupid the other one is
74:32 you'll get facts wrong and if you're
74:35 doing a live session that's usually for
74:37 folks that are processing you know 17
74:38 posts they're parsing the news as it's
74:42 been posted on websites and so you can
74:45 get a lot of stuff wrong and then again
74:48 it's forever because even if you
74:50 terminate the feed and it's up there for
74:53 a few seconds people can download that
74:54 feed and then they can you know crucify
74:56 you with your comments that you got
74:59 wrong and you can't take them back now I
75:01 know that my episodes are packed with
75:04 saying the wrong name getting a number
75:07 wrong that kind of stuff I'm willing to
75:10 live with those mistakes because I will
75:12 then later either acknowledge it in the
75:14 video or in the comment section that I
75:16 got that wrong or in some cases I
75:17 rerecord the episode which I've done a
75:20 couple times in the past like the cancer
75:22 episode was redone because I just I just
75:25 recently published the new remastered
75:26 one and I cover it in the front of the
75:30 video I say look first time I made the
75:33 cancer episode I was very cantankerous
75:35 and so I was just adding a lot of
75:38 emotion to the content which was just
75:41 off topic why if you're already in a
75:44 cancerous state and you're watching the
75:46 episode to learn about all the
75:47 alternative methods that I've discovered
75:49 which have work
75:51 extremely well for my friends I mean
75:54 what's funny about it and I'll say this
75:56 every once in a while I have now worked
76:01 with three individuals who were in stage
76:04 four cancer one was given a six-month
76:06 death sentence when I sent my stuff over
76:10 and with the episode and you know I'm
76:13 telling people look you know you can do
76:15 all of your normal therapy that your
76:17 oncologist says you can add this to it
76:18 because it won't hurt that other therapy
76:20 whatsoever in fact you might actually
76:22 live through that other therapy instead
76:23 of dying of the other therapy but the
76:27 very first person I ever helped I sent
76:29 the information over and they got the
76:31 information from someone else same exact
76:33 information on how to cure themselves
76:34 and because that came from multiple
76:37 sources they followed it to the T and
76:39 they were really good about getting rich
76:41 you know sugar and meat out of their
76:42 diets and and they followed it to the T
76:45 one lady within four months was in full
76:48 remission she was given a six month
76:51 death sentence and she was in full
76:54 remission in four months she now is
76:56 perfectly fine living a perfectly full
77:00 life no longer haunted by this and
77:02 because the treatment worked she doesn't
77:05 live in that constant fear that it'll
77:06 come back
77:07 she's like [ __ ] go ahead go ahead and
77:09 try to come back I'll kill you and
77:11 that's what every survivor of cancer
77:13 ends up feeling is that you know these
77:15 that traditional techniques they live in
77:18 fear because they're told by the
77:19 oncologist well this could all come back
77:20 you know I'm gonna make a [ __ ] ton of
77:22 money off of you and just to remind you
77:25 like I know I'm sort of digressing at
77:27 the finale here but it's the bonus track
77:30 on the album if you just let it go for a
77:31 little while this other track shows up
77:33 as far as I know have you worked in
77:36 pharmaceuticals a doctor doesn't the
77:39 doctors usually get kickbacks from
77:41 prescribing a particular drug so let's
77:43 just say you had a bacterial infection
77:45 and they give you cipro or a z-pack now
77:48 maybe by the time those drugs are on the
77:50 market this didn't exist so I'm not
77:51 trying to be perfectly accurate here but
77:53 there were there was a program in place
77:55 that if you prescribed the drug that the
77:58 pharmaceutical company was allowed to
78:00 give you a kickback for every time you
78:01 prescribed their drug and that caused a
78:04 bunch of doctor
78:04 to over prescribed drugs and you know
78:07 screw people up if you had just a little
78:09 bit of a symptom boom they gave you the
78:11 drug because they got a kickback they
78:12 bought a summer home one on vacations
78:14 put a million dollars in the bank and
78:15 some Swiss account that is all from what
78:19 I understand been abolished except for
78:21 an in oncology the doctors actually get
78:24 kickbacks and it correct me if I'm wrong
78:28 for a long time they were and I think
78:30 it's still present they're able to get
78:31 kickbacks from your chemotherapy ok so
78:35 you come in let's say you have some
78:37 cancer they have a chance of not putting
78:40 that in your system or putting that in
78:42 your system if they put that in your
78:43 system they get a bunch of extra money
78:45 on the side what do you think they're
78:47 gonna do do you really think they care
78:50 about you you really they don't know you
78:52 are if it's your uncle your aunt who's
78:54 the oncologist you might have a moral
78:56 fiber in there where they're gonna say
78:57 oh you don't want the [ __ ] in your
78:59 system it'll [ __ ] you up
79:01 corporations are only about money people
79:03 that's all they care about it so anyway
79:06 if you do have someone who's sick from
79:07 cancer go get the episode it's what it
79:09 is is a culmination of all the other
79:11 alternate theories that I have found on
79:14 the web it just so happens a bunch of
79:16 them work and be seventeen and vitamin C
79:19 is the number one thing I found
79:21 obliterates this stuff now you might
79:24 have a different type of cancer but
79:26 again the only thing that can kill
79:28 inoperable cancer is your immune system
79:30 and so those two drugs vitamins excuse
79:33 me supercharge your immune system they
79:36 go look at the Gershon technique go look
79:38 at thermal therapy you know there's a
79:40 bunch of different things you can do
79:42 anyway that's it if you have been to
79:46 deep thoughts radio calm please go
79:47 that's where you can change from audio
79:49 to video video to audio we have a lock
79:51 facebook group with a lot of cool people
79:53 in it we have a Twitter page which gets
79:56 updated far after the episodes actually
79:59 release so I apologize to those on
80:01 Twitter hopefully they'll get better in
80:03 the future there's not a lot of traffic
80:05 and there's not a lot of followers so
80:06 I'm not really feeling a guilt trip on
80:07 that but those do want to tip the show
80:10 support the cigar regiments and reward
80:12 me for any of my efforts there's a
80:14 patreon account it's at the bottom of
80:16 every single
80:18 video's description you can just click
80:20 over to that but if you go to details
80:21 radio comm it's all in there so you can
80:23 see stuff as it becomes available
80:26 anyway take care of yourself at someone
80:29 else and I'll see you in the next deep
80:30 thoughts over now
