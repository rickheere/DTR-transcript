00:00 [Music]
00:32 good evening ladies and gentlemen and
00:35 welcome back to deep bounce today's
00:38 episode is brought to you by liPuma
00:42 these are great sticks about a 45-minute
00:47 burn time the flavor is insane for a new
00:51 world no complaints destructions great
00:56 burn is great I've been smoking these in
01:01 between shows so I find myself I find
01:07 myself turning down my gain on my box a
01:10 lot
01:10 I found myself referencing a few movies
01:15 all the time of my lifetime and I think
01:19 that the best way for me to describe
01:21 this is to say there are certain movies
01:25 that of my family which for me was
01:27 really my dad and I is after about 10 he
01:30 and I lived together until I was 16 so
01:34 about six years but then before that
01:35 even there was probably at least three
01:38 years of full-blown consciousness I had
01:42 where movies are considered heirlooms to
01:46 the family we watched them over and over
01:49 and over again and they're just
01:52 phenomenal and they come with gifts that
01:55 you can think about your entire lifetime
01:57 at least my brain loves these gifts and
02:03 so I thought I would review with you
02:04 fairly quickly a series of films that
02:07 are heirlooms in my family most immerse
02:10 IFI now doesn't mean that I'm gonna
02:12 mention every movie it's an heirloom of
02:14 my family because there are plenty but I
02:17 want to talk about the ones that are
02:18 sort of forgotten because that's
02:20 important if I said hey we're gonna talk
02:22 about Blade Runner I did a whole episode
02:23 on Blade Runner I am gonna cover one
02:26 film that I think is forgotten that I
02:28 did a whole episode on but there's some
02:31 other words I've mentioned him to you
02:32 from time to time I'm gonna try to tease
02:36 you with enough information to want to
02:40 go
02:40 see these films most of you the guys who
02:43 are at least 40 or above definitely 50
02:46 or above have seen these films probably
02:48 numerous times but I bet I've got one
02:51 you haven't seen out of the whole bunch
02:52 I'll mention it when it comes around but
02:55 for those of you seen them you know
02:58 they're special and they touch you for
03:02 the rest of your life
03:03 and science fiction is very interesting
03:05 that way because it's not supposed to be
03:07 capable of doing that even though that's
03:09 the goal of every writer and these films
03:11 were cult classics every single one of
03:13 them but people don't know that they
03:16 exist and when you pull them out with
03:18 your friends and you have you seen this
03:20 get about 50 50 people going yeah hell
03:23 yeah definitely throw it in there man no
03:25 one has any complaints they're like
03:26 throw it in there man let me wait a
03:27 minute we got a drink let me get
03:28 something to eat let me smoke my weed
03:31 whatever it is I'm gonna start back in
03:35 1951 it's a movie called The Day the
03:39 Earth Stood Still and it was remade with
03:42 a brilliant actor Keanu Reeves I don't
03:46 think he really had a script that was
03:47 worth doing but you know I wouldn't turn
03:49 it down if I were him as well you never
03:51 know you never know what's gonna happen
03:52 in a movie you read a script and you may
03:55 think it sucks but you're thinking well
03:56 surely they're gonna rewrite the ending
03:58 you know that's really post-production
04:00 they're gonna figure out this thing as
04:01 weak points and it'll all work out in
04:04 the end and then it stays exactly the
04:05 same and you get to the end and you're
04:06 like oh god it did that film but the Day
04:10 the Earth Stood Still from 1951 stars an
04:14 actor Michael Raney r-e in an ie
04:18 brilliant refined amazing actor without
04:23 this guy it would have been hard to have
04:26 the character that we're going to have
04:30 so that we're going to talk about in
04:31 this film the film starts out with the
04:35 UFO a plain old-fashioned flying saucer
04:38 except that it has a it doesn't have a
04:41 completely round bottom it actually has
04:43 a kind of a flat disc bottom and then it
04:46 kind of comes up and does the UFO thing
04:48 and it's typically bigger than most of
04:50 the UFOs they did this great optical
04:52 effect of overexposing
04:54 so that the spaceship is like white-hot
04:57 as it's going around the world it's
05:00 being reported in every country which
05:01 was kind of interesting they they took
05:03 the tact that it does have a global
05:06 interest and this is before the Twilight
05:08 Zone did the episode to serve man which
05:11 also had a global element to it where
05:13 they were constantly reporting in from
05:16 all the different countries that were at
05:19 least first world level countries but
05:23 this thing comes and flies around the
05:25 world letting everyone know it's here
05:27 and it lands in a baseball park baseball
05:30 field in Washington DC and it lands
05:35 during the day and so the army shows up
05:38 citizens show up they've got the place
05:41 cordoned off but they're everyone's
05:42 pretty close to it you know it's got
05:44 this whole thing cordon off it's
05:46 gorgeous the spaceship is from 1951 Wow
05:50 beautiful and it's mainly beautiful not
05:54 only by its shape but the way this door
05:56 opens up on the front of it it's just
05:58 brilliant how they did this sliding
06:00 steel looking stuff the whole thing's
06:02 made of wood in real life but they slid
06:05 this thing out and this door comes
06:06 across and out comes this giant robot
06:11 named Court you won't know his name's
06:14 Gort maybe even the whole movie unless
06:16 you pay attention to a couple couple
06:18 references here and there but he comes
06:21 out it's it's a big steel robot a big
06:25 rubber costume they built two suits
06:27 there was a zipper down the front of one
06:29 of them when they had to film in from
06:30 the back and a big zipper down the back
06:31 and if you watch carefully you can see
06:33 the zipper it's kind of cool that's not
06:35 what makes it amazing out walks a
06:39 humanoid the robots for the humanoid -
06:42 right
06:42 two legs two arms is this amazing like
06:46 visor thing that lifts up and it's just
06:49 being cool it's like it's the protector
06:53 he stands aside and here comes this
06:57 humanoid I mean in a spacesuit as an
07:00 interesting mask on that was probably
07:03 definitely a plot mechanism to make
07:05 everyone worried
07:07 and there's some sort of you know
07:09 low-end military person the president
07:11 shows doesn't show up five-star general
07:14 does not show up it's kind of funny
07:16 because it's just happening just
07:17 happening you know the lead character
07:20 walks out Klaatu and he steps to this
07:28 authority figure and he's got this
07:31 little thing in his hand and he holds it
07:34 up and he's offering it to the guy the
07:36 problem is is that the thing expands and
07:39 so it creates these little prongs
07:40 sticking out and there's a bunch of like
07:43 gung-ho soldiers just came out of World
07:45 War two and you know they're used to
07:48 life threatening situations and here's
07:50 this alien coming out of a freaking
07:52 spaceship and as soon as the thing pops
07:55 open one of the guys shoots it with the
07:57 45 destroys the thing in his hand falls
08:00 on the ground the guy you know Oh God
08:02 you know you kind of wring his hand
08:04 pretty hard and he so I you know leans
08:07 over and then gort's like what hey you
08:11 shot at my dude visor comes up and pow
08:16 pow pow pow
08:17 this dude shoots every weapon and
08:19 everything melts all of the tanks melt
08:22 so guys are jumping out of their tanks
08:24 the guns get shot the jeeps get shot
08:27 everything gets shot just melts to the
08:28 ground everyone's safe of course he's
08:31 got a tell Gore to stop because courts
08:33 about to [ __ ] everything up hardcore
08:36 courts amazingly designed I mean just
08:39 formidable as hell you're scared of the
08:41 guy cuz he's got it sort of some unknown
08:42 thing right but that's just the that's
08:46 just the first scene to get you enticed
08:50 now the other thing that's going on in
08:52 the film is that there's a theremin
08:54 which is a very interesting interest
08:56 instrument that is using electromagnetic
09:01 waves to create sound waves and it was
09:04 sort of a weird gimmicky thing that just
09:06 made sound but one guy in Hollywood
09:08 figured out how to play this theremin
09:10 and he is
09:11 I think credited with being the only guy
09:15 that actually used the theremin
09:16 professionally to create anything that
09:18 sounded like music so the soundtrack
09:20 this whole movie is very very unique
09:24 very unique I believe he was gonna be on
09:29 the next film to that I'm talking about
09:31 did some thurman work so the whole
09:33 thing's ominous and strange but the
09:37 reason why the film takes off is that
09:40 the alien is captured and he knows it's
09:42 all part of the game he's not stupid and
09:45 he gets interrogated and he find out
09:47 when they took his suit off he just
09:48 looks like a human being he looks like
09:50 my uncle it's really funny and he's
09:53 trying to say that thing you just shot
09:55 out on my hand is a device with like
09:59 libraries and libraries of things in it
10:01 that would have cured all of your
10:02 problems all of your illness all of your
10:05 irrigation issues agricultural issues
10:07 manufacturing issues and you idiots just
10:11 shot it doesn't call him anything like
10:13 that the rapport this actor is top-notch
10:17 he's a first-class human being and so it
10:21 comes through and the character in the
10:22 movie beautifully and so they're dealing
10:24 with a super intelligent being and this
10:26 actor plays it perfectly but eventually
10:31 he escapes his captivity and he ends up
10:34 taking up room and board in a boarding
10:37 house where a lot of people live sort of
10:39 what happened back in those days you'd
10:41 get a brownstone and you'd have a lot of
10:43 rooms in it you just rent a room in one
10:45 of the rooms has a mother and his son
10:49 and I can't remember how they alienated
10:52 the the father away me I think maybe
10:55 died in the war or something but the
10:57 kid's father is no longer alive I saw
11:00 the moms trying to date she's got a good
11:02 suitor who comes and visits but here
11:05 comes this dude and he's in there and
11:07 he's eating dinner with these people and
11:10 they have no idea that he's the alien
11:11 that escaped it's going on the radio and
11:13 they're all kind of freaked out and he's
11:15 trying to calm him down but of course he
11:17 doesn't want to give away the fact that
11:18 he's the alien and the little boy takes
11:21 the super shine to him and so he's like
11:24 whoop mom's got to go off and go to work
11:27 and he's like well you mind if I take
11:28 Bobby out or Billy out one of the
11:32 - that's Bobby takes Bobby out and you
11:38 know they go see movies and they chill
11:40 out and he's having the kid kind of show
11:41 him around town because he's like wow
11:43 why not see humanity through a child's
11:45 eyes isn't that beautiful today would be
11:49 utterly frowned upon of course there's a
11:52 lot of funny little things where the guy
11:54 needs money to pay for something and
11:56 he's he's like well I don't have any
11:58 money but I've got these these good for
12:00 money no holds out his hand and they're
12:02 diamonds in his hand and the kids like
12:04 oh my god it's probably worth $100 you
12:07 know and so this this progresses but the
12:14 movies called The Day the Earth Stood
12:16 Still so what's that all about
12:17 for those of you haven't seen it he is
12:21 trying to get the world to pay attention
12:25 to him for one second and then if you
12:27 get the whole world to get on the same
12:29 frequency of consciousness then perhaps
12:32 the world has a chance and so he goes
12:36 back to his spaceship and he sets up a
12:39 little timer and it makes everything
12:43 stop all engines all electricity stops
12:47 now they don't explain that what happens
12:48 to airplanes and things that are in you
12:51 know a moment of peril they don't talk
12:54 about patients that need machines or
12:56 they're gonna die so they just kind of
12:57 you know suspension of disbelief there
12:59 but he ends up in an elevator with the
13:02 mother and he tells her you know it's
13:05 almost 12 o'clock 12 p.m. this is about
13:08 to occur and then boom the elevator
13:11 stops and they're in there and I can't
13:15 remember how long it lasts but lasts
13:17 quite a while now that's the setup I'm
13:21 gonna leave you with it's a 1951 movie
13:24 so it has a really good ending films
13:28 doing it make back in those days nor
13:30 become cold classics without great
13:31 endings there's more gore - mm-hmm but
13:37 the interesting thing about this was
13:39 that you tried to show us the contrast
13:42 between humanity being so gung-ho
13:46 and an intelligent being that has the
13:50 intellectual power to develop equipment
13:52 and machines and transportation to get
13:55 from wherever they are to wherever we
13:57 are in a heliocentric space world of
13:59 course and how we can just be ignorant
14:02 and if you think about it there's a huge
14:05 theme an archetype of that problem in
14:09 today's society we have solutions for
14:11 things lying everywhere we have medium
14:15 intellectuals that could solve
14:16 80 to 90 percent of the world's problems
14:18 before we even get to our super geniuses
14:20 we don't need oil there's a hundred zero
14:24 point energy systems that have been
14:25 discovered used filmed on TV Jack
14:29 Nicholson was working on some hydrogen
14:32 stuff was the stay in Myers had a water
14:37 system fracturing system made hydrogen
14:39 at a tap water
14:40 he drove clear across the United States
14:42 twice they challenged him so he kept
14:45 getting it better better and better and
14:47 better Tesla he was about to give us all
14:49 free energy out of the world's interior
14:52 plasma core and so this film outside of
14:58 just being brilliantly shot great
15:00 soundtrack it doesn't have the
15:02 pound-for-pound Michael Bay sci-fi stuff
15:05 like spaceships and robots everywhere
15:07 not kind of thing it has one ship one
15:09 robot and one alien and the alien looks
15:12 human but if you pay attention he is
15:15 definitely not human the way he acts the
15:17 way it's written it's beautiful and
15:20 there's some interesting characters I
15:22 even told you about that get involved
15:23 which are really cute so if you haven't
15:26 seen the 1951 The Day the Earth Stood
15:29 Still and I believe you can get on
15:30 Netflix if not all the time
15:33 frequent enough that just just pay
15:35 attention to it throughout the year hell
15:36 it's probably on YouTube I don't think
15:39 anyone's trying to hold out on the
15:40 royalties for that one at this point but
15:43 now fast forward five years going to our
15:46 next film film I mention all the time
15:48 throughout episodes it is a landmark
15:52 science fiction movie and when I say
15:54 landmark I mean in every dimension of
15:57 everything that we would ever
16:00 itemizes a science fiction film never
16:02 science fiction is supposed to be
16:04 realistic it has a little bit of fantasy
16:07 in it but the spaceship that you're
16:10 gonna see which is in the opening
16:12 credits and again it has a just
16:15 incredible soundtrack it's in color it's
16:18 an amazing color 1951 Day the Earth
16:20 Stood Still is in black and white the
16:22 second movie is forbid or not we knew
16:25 Leslie Nielsen in this world as a
16:27 comedian he was in all the airplane
16:29 movies he was in The Naked Gun series
16:33 he's in just countless comedies but in
16:36 this film even though he has some
16:38 comedic lines he is a very serious
16:40 captain of a spaceship but now the
16:44 spaceship is careening through space
16:46 it's an original design is very flying
16:48 saucer-like it's the one we all drew in
16:50 the 70s a little bubble in the center
16:52 with a little disc on the outside has a
16:55 pretty hefty crew in it I don't know how
16:57 many people in it but it's quite a few
16:58 let's say 30 to 50 somewhere in there
17:00 they'd probably say in the film I just
17:02 forgot about it it came out 1956 it has
17:06 the gentleman who was on Charlie's
17:08 Angels the guy that actually was the
17:10 mediary between them and the speaker
17:12 where Charlie was on the speaker has
17:14 that dude and it's probably his first
17:15 role he does kind of an abysmal job
17:17 acting but god bless him but has some
17:21 classic actors from that time and a lot
17:24 of them in fact two of them are in
17:28 Twilight zones right off the bat but
17:30 it's the debut of Robby the Robot as
17:32 well the story is about a ship that is
17:35 going to a planet where a colony had
17:38 landed previously 20 years ago and they
17:41 never reported back and so they're
17:44 flying by and they're calling down to
17:46 the ground to say we need you know
17:48 clearance to land and I should say prior
17:50 to them landing there's a science
17:52 fiction theory that they did where
17:54 they're going so quickly that in order
17:56 to slow the ship down they can't have
17:58 humans inside the ship in their human
18:00 form in their normal mass form because
18:04 the stop would destroy their bodies
18:07 inside they don't have a neural dampers
18:08 let's say so they actually have to step
18:10 on these pods
18:11 and it took me like 20 times seeing this
18:13 film before I realized what the hell was
18:15 going on they step on these pods that
18:17 are very similar to the transporter pods
18:20 in Star Trek and they're put into this
18:23 atomized stage they're all beams of
18:25 energy and while the ship slows down and
18:28 when the ship slows down they turn back
18:29 into humans and that protects them from
18:31 the slowdown I mean how brilliant is
18:33 that 1956 1956 brilliant Ben but they
18:40 called down they make contact with one
18:42 of the settlers and it's this guy
18:44 playing dr. Edward Morbius MORB IUS and
18:50 it's played by an actor who is just the
18:55 same caliber as the guy that played in
18:58 the the Rena the rainy guy from The Day
19:02 the Earth Stood Still his name's Walter
19:05 Pidgeon he has to play a character that
19:08 has been on this planet for twenty years
19:10 he is a linguist so already the way he
19:14 communicates has to be top-notch he's a
19:16 PhD linguist
19:17 but when you get further into the film
19:20 you will find out that he has boosted
19:22 his IQ like three hundred plus percent
19:25 and so now the writers of this film have
19:28 a character on their on deck that they
19:32 have to write for that is not only a PhD
19:34 linguist but he's also boosted as IQ 300
19:37 percent and I will tell you for my money
19:40 there's not a word out of place every
19:46 form of communication with this guy
19:48 holds up a hundred percent it's amazing
19:52 but they show up and they land and the
19:55 landing sequence is legendary the ship
19:59 landing is the most beautiful in camera
20:02 compositing work you've ever seen for
20:04 the 50s
20:05 it's what EDD would aspire to on all of
20:08 his films but they get out of their ship
20:12 start looking around it's this sort of
20:15 desert II sci-fi book cover from the 50s
20:18 and no sooner there they kind of like
20:22 settle down they look in the bando off
20:24 in the distance and there's
20:25 easy super fast dust cloud coming and
20:27 it's like you know Mach one at least and
20:31 they're like they're kind of freaked out
20:32 it's coming right at him and as it comes
20:35 at him
20:36 they pull out their guns I believe and
20:39 it's Robbie the robot pulling this
20:42 little carriage in the back with two
20:46 seats with this these really cool
20:48 plexiglass like reflectors in the front
20:51 to deflect our deflectors to make sure
20:53 that the wind doesn't blow you off the
20:55 vehicle as he's driving this Mach speed
20:56 of course and Robbie the robot waddles
21:00 out of this thing and of all the robots
21:03 ever created in science fiction history
21:06 until we got to really modern 70s stuff
21:09 I would say Robbie the robot is
21:11 ingenious he looks a little goofy but he
21:16 was just head over heels better than the
21:20 lost in space robot lost in space robot
21:22 looked like a toy you look ridiculous
21:24 it didn't look inviting at all it didn't
21:27 look like it was made by somebody who
21:28 had any style and I apologized to people
21:31 made that but Robbie's stuff was
21:33 beautiful and the suit that's probably
21:35 the robot I got to see as a kid and the
21:37 cars of stars back in the 70s and he's
21:41 actually made a leather but it looks
21:43 like polished steel like really thick
21:46 steel and I don't know how many movies
21:49 he showed him up in after that but this
21:52 is the one this is the one you want to
21:54 see him debuting but he has all these
21:56 funny sayings because he he's SuperDuper
22:00 strong and so he's like you know I just
22:02 lifted a you know 50 tons of steel this
22:05 morning and I barely you know broke a
22:07 sweat kind of thing you know he's really
22:09 kind of funny but he's come to pick them
22:11 up because when they were calling down
22:14 to the planet Morbius as they're saying
22:16 look you don't want to be down here you
22:19 don't want to land I don't want you to
22:21 land and they're like I'm sorry we
22:24 traveled clear across the galaxy to get
22:26 to you we're gonna land we're gonna find
22:28 out what the hell happened to all the
22:29 survivors I mean sorry all the colony
22:32 members who survived what's going on so
22:35 eventually they kind of threatened him
22:36 and he gives them some coordinates and
22:38 that's when Robbie comes
22:39 takes a mom and they take him to this
22:41 beautiful sort of George Jetson house
22:45 except it's built it's real
22:48 Morbius sort of reluctantly invites them
22:51 in shows him his pad it's beautiful I
22:55 mean like we should build this house let
22:57 me tell you and it's three guys and this
23:00 is what's really huge if you go see my
23:02 Star Trek episode and you haven't seen
23:05 this film you will have heard this pitch
23:07 before it's the very first time a
23:10 captain a science officer and a ship's
23:13 doctor go out to see what's going on and
23:16 where did that get picked up you get
23:19 picked up by Gene Roddenberry
23:20 brilliantly for Star Trek which I think
23:24 was 1966 or 67 67 68 69 yeah so em he
23:28 was riding it for a couple years
23:29 beforehand but he loved that and that's
23:32 where he got that little combination but
23:36 you start hearing this engagement with
23:37 this guy and he is telling them
23:40 basically the bare minimum that they
23:42 need to know he says that all the
23:46 survivors died they got in the ship and
23:48 tried to escape and the ship crashed and
23:52 so he had to bury all of them he points
23:53 off in the distance at this at this
23:56 cemetery that he had to bury them all by
23:58 himself and they said well you've
24:00 married some woman and he goes yeah
24:04 check the Judy songs or whatever
24:05 person's name was and she was in the on
24:08 the crew she was another PhD scientist I
24:10 married her and then he had a kid the
24:16 daughter has played by Anne Francis she
24:19 plays altaira Moebius and she was
24:23 beautiful let me tell you and so these
24:26 three guys are in the house I think
24:30 they're almost done with her
24:31 conversation then all of a sudden out
24:32 Tara shows up and these guys haven't
24:35 seen a girl in a really long time
24:36 because they've been out on the ship you
24:37 know and they're all like Boyington you
24:40 know their eyeballs are popping out of
24:41 their heads and of course Leslie Nielsen
24:45 he's got an eye for this girl but so do
24:47 the other two dudes the doctor is
24:49 actually pretty cool
24:50 but there's this other guy who's a big
24:53 player he tries to he tries to pull all
24:56 kinds of shenanigans with her try to
24:57 trick her into all kinds of stuff and
25:00 Morbius did not want them to meet her
25:03 because he's like look I don't want my
25:04 kid wanting to go back with you and I
25:06 don't want you messing with her and so
25:10 they could they conclude their first
25:13 meeting and they go back to their ship
25:14 and they got a now report back home
25:17 because they didn't intend on finding
25:19 everybody dead and so they don't know
25:21 what to do that I have orders for that
25:23 scenario which is kind of weird
25:24 maybe they were all dead there's orders
25:27 but because there's one guy there and
25:28 he's got a daughter and like did we
25:29 bring this guy back with us what do we
25:31 do so in order to send a message back to
25:33 earth they've got to disassemble the
25:35 core of the ship to build a transmitter
25:37 to get a message all the way back to
25:41 earth and so there's this disassembly
25:43 process and by the way the movies got
25:45 tons of comedy in it as well it's not
25:48 technically a comedy but you're gonna
25:49 have a really good time with some of the
25:51 stuff they do I won't even ruin a single
25:53 scene for you in that room but that
25:56 night when they all go to bed after
25:58 they've kind of done a little bit of
25:59 disassembling there is this
26:04 and again the soundtrack to this thing
26:05 is unlike anything you've ever seen in
26:09 any film it's so brilliant and this the
26:11 effects for 1956 were at the very peak I
26:15 think it's an MGM film but they you hear
26:21 these footsteps coming into the ship and
26:24 they do this thing with the ground I'll
26:25 let you see it when you see it but it
26:27 comes in to the ship and they show you
26:29 it in various ways getting up the stairs
26:31 and then a guy screams and I believe
26:37 it's the Charlie's Angels guys that dies
26:40 but it destroys a piece of this
26:47 communication capability so that it
26:49 can't communicate and so they go back to
26:52 Morbius the next day and they're like
26:53 what the hell you didn't tell us there
26:55 were creatures on this planet and he's
26:58 kind of being a little evasive he's
27:01 killing well you know I told you you
27:02 shouldn't a landed man
27:04 and then he kind of reveals a little bit
27:06 more about the story and he's like you
27:07 know it's weird is my wife and I loved
27:09 this place we wanted to stay but none of
27:11 the other people wanted to stay and it's
27:13 almost as if their hatred for this
27:15 planet got them killed and then we dig
27:21 deeper and deeper now I'm trying to
27:23 figure out how to give you guys the
27:25 beautiful Jim of this film without
27:30 ruining it for you because it's in the
27:32 third act and you'll hear me talk about
27:37 this all the time in the shows so I
27:39 don't want to necessarily do spoilers on
27:41 every single one of these shows I think
27:42 it'd be better to entice you but what
27:45 they find out about this dude and this
27:48 won't this won't actually spoil the
27:50 phone for you at all but they find out
27:52 that this guy discovered a the previous
27:55 civilization that was on this planet and
27:58 because he was a linguist he was the
27:59 first guy that could start translating
28:01 what the hell was going on he found like
28:03 rooms way down inside the bowels of the
28:05 earth of this planet and it's got a
28:07 whole the whole thing is like a big
28:08 machine inside it's crazy
28:10 and again the sets are amazing it's the
28:14 first time you will see the Princess
28:16 Leia machine that you know you're our
28:19 only hope kind of thing it's there's one
28:24 of those projected in the movie 1956
28:26 more than 20 years before star wars
28:29 debuts it's great and it's done just as
28:33 well
28:33 it's like these 77 it's crazy but the
28:37 secret of what they what they find is
28:39 utterly and it's just utterly profound
28:43 it's got to be one of the most profound
28:48 turns of a science fiction film in
28:53 history and it will make you think about
28:56 yourself when you're done when you find
28:57 out what they figure out it will make
28:59 you look at yourself differently to the
29:01 degree you understand it now I will say
29:03 as a child I never got it as an adult I
29:06 was like because I had I'd seen it
29:09 several times as a kid and I'm looking
29:10 at all the funny stuff and you know the
29:12 goofy interactions and the spaceships
29:14 and Robbie the robot then I saw it in my
29:16 probably my 30
29:17 when I bought a copy of it when I got
29:20 the DVD and I just watched the hell out
29:22 of it I think I bought it on iTunes as
29:23 well so I could see it anytime I wanted
29:25 to and my mind was utterly blown that I
29:27 had missed this thing everyone else saw
29:29 it as adults right back in the day I
29:31 would be very interested to hear how
29:35 people reacted to this in 56 because
29:36 this was deep okay very Freudian but
29:42 anyway if you haven't seen Forbidden
29:43 Planet you owe it to yourself if you're
29:45 even the slightest Leslie Nielsen fan
29:48 you need to watch it
29:50 it's it's a beautiful achievement his
29:53 but this Walter Pidgeon guy Wow
29:59 his performance is second to none
30:02 second to none okay now we're gonna
30:05 fast-forward quite a few quite a few
30:07 years here now I'm gonna mention one
30:11 that I've done an episode about I'm
30:13 gonna get to it fairly quickly because
30:14 the episodes out there you can see it
30:15 but it's a 1975 science fiction film
30:19 rollerball with James Caan if you're if
30:23 you consider yourself remotely and
30:26 ladies this is for you to remotely
30:28 interested in being awake rollerball is
30:32 a prophecy that is coming true right
30:34 before your very eyes especially with
30:36 Amazon getting huge Google getting huge
30:38 all these corporations getting huge and
30:40 they're trying to save humanity they're
30:42 trying to advance that narrative you
30:46 need to see it but rollerball is about
30:50 the individual and the power of the
30:51 human spirit it is about the idea that
30:54 no matter what you try to do to mankind
30:58 mankind will always prevail in the name
31:00 of freedom because it is what God built
31:03 us out of the individual freedoms of man
31:06 doesn't mean we can't work together
31:08 because this is a team sport you're
31:11 watching but it's about a gentleman
31:13 played by James Caan who plays a
31:17 character Jonathan II and he plays a
31:20 game called rollerball and this game is
31:23 physical and real there's no special
31:25 effects in this movie whatsoever it is
31:28 all in camera they built this
31:30 beautiful beautiful ring that is this
31:33 rollerball course it's it must have been
31:35 pretty huge it looks like what roller
31:39 derby is today but it's like science
31:41 fiction and super serious and they've
31:43 got motorcycles with armor on them guys
31:46 with armor spiked gloves I mean it's
31:49 like it's like a death match on steroids
31:53 man but it's not terribly bloody but
31:58 Jonathan he is the best in the entire
31:59 world and he works for the houston
32:01 corporation the used in corporation
32:02 controls all power I don't know for the
32:05 world or definitely for its region but
32:07 it's got a orange dot as its symbol the
32:11 whole company's orange mm-hmm
32:13 go figure RIT's in this future where all
32:16 the corporation's run the world there
32:18 are no more countries there are no more
32:19 States corporations have removed all
32:23 needs in the world they also tried to
32:26 remove all individuality very much like
32:30 the obsolete man from Twilight Zone and
32:33 one way or another but they asked him to
32:36 retire he plays this amazing game right
32:38 at the very beginning of the movie so
32:39 you just have this hot amazing intro
32:41 with Toccata and Fugue in D minor by
32:44 Bach at the beginning plays this amazing
32:49 game I mean it's just you almost want
32:52 this game to exist - the terminal
32:54 violence that can exist if you take away
32:56 the rules but Jonathan plays great this
32:59 old man who's the owner of the Houston
33:03 he's the CEO of the Houston corporation
33:05 he owns a team he comes in he's kind of
33:07 celebrating with the guys and he says
33:10 you know he just tells them they're all
33:12 great and to keep going and then he
33:13 looks at Jonathan he goes come see me
33:15 tomorrow so he goes in to see the old
33:17 man in this amazing office with all this
33:20 hanging glass she cuts his finger on and
33:24 the old man says we need you to retire
33:25 and he says well I don't understand why
33:28 do you want me to retire I'm still top
33:31 of my game
33:31 it says well that's what we want for you
33:33 and you need to do what we say and I
33:35 don't know why you'd want to play this
33:36 game in the first place it's a barbaric
33:38 game
33:38 anyway it was designed to teach the
33:42 population the futility of individualism
33:46 and he can't you know he's just been a
33:48 sports guy his whole life he doesn't
33:50 really understand intellectual thoughts
33:52 yet he's got a good mind but he
33:55 definitely doesn't understand this layer
33:57 of the ruling class which they call the
34:00 executive layer the way the world works
34:03 in this world of all worlds yet the
34:04 people you have the roller ballers and
34:07 you have the executives and the old man
34:10 lets him know he says you know what
34:11 executives dream about they dream about
34:14 being great roller ballers and you know
34:17 what rollerball is dream about about
34:19 being powerful executives so you lived a
34:24 damn good life and you will be taking
34:25 care of your whole life you just need to
34:26 retire and James Caan place from start
34:31 to finish the most calm cool dude you've
34:35 ever seen in the film going through the
34:38 most intense midlife crisis you'll ever
34:40 see but immediately tries to go out and
34:42 find out well what's the deal why do
34:45 they want me to quit this doesn't make
34:46 any sense to me he was given the clue in
34:49 the office because you're getting too
34:52 good you are proving that there is
34:55 powering the individual so the movie
34:59 goes on and it is designed to well what
35:03 ends up happening just as a trailer is
35:06 that they keep squeezing him and
35:08 squeezing him and they keep trying to
35:09 keep him out of the next game in the
35:11 next game and they keep reducing rules
35:13 and they he suspects at one point
35:15 they're trying to kill him they get his
35:16 girlfriend he's been living with to
35:18 leave he calls on some of his closest
35:20 friends to find out what the hell's
35:22 going on and no one could find out
35:23 anything one of the guys yells on him
35:26 why can't you just do what you're told
35:28 well I'm gonna give you the spoiler a
35:33 light spoiler that you know is probably
35:35 coming in this because it got made it's
35:37 a movie Jonathan wins humanity wins the
35:47 ending of this film if you are really
35:50 getting it grah
35:51 as they used to say should reinforce
35:57 everything we're doing in the in the
35:59 truth movement everything we're doing in
36:01 the Great Awakening and I would dare any
36:05 grown man not to have a lump in his
36:07 throat I don't know what it does to the
36:09 females but every man out there
36:12 listening to me who's ever said I will
36:15 do whatever it takes to protect my
36:17 country myself humanity in general all
36:20 other countries this movies for you and
36:24 it will reinforce you ten to one you can
36:29 watch it 50 times and it'll still do the
36:31 same thing to you it's crazy that was
36:35 rollerball 1975 with James Caan
36:38 now we're gonna fast-forward the next
36:41 movie I've been talking about a lot was
36:43 released in 1980
36:44 it's called altered states stars William
36:48 Hurt phenomenal actor it's one of his
36:52 first movies and wow what a first movie
36:55 to be a part of let me tell you it's
36:59 about a Harvard Medical grad who is in
37:04 search of the inception point of life
37:08 and he believes that in all mass and
37:12 energy is the history that he's looking
37:16 for and he merely needs to kinetically
37:17 go backwards and be as if you took a
37:20 pool table and you reversed it from
37:22 every ball being in the pocket to being
37:25 back out on the felt right to the break
37:28 he believes he can do that and he is
37:31 taking hallucinogenics like ayahuasca
37:35 type drugs putting himself in a
37:37 deprivation tank some of you know what
37:39 that is some of you don't but it's a
37:40 blacked out tank you're in floating in
37:43 water it's got a lot of salt in and so
37:45 you're very buoyant you can go to most
37:46 colleges and do this but it shuts off
37:50 all of your sensors you were little
37:52 blinders on if there's lights in it and
37:57 you have no senses such that you have no
38:00 outside contribution to senses and so
38:03 you you have only yourself you're meant
38:05 consciousness and it starts in plotting
38:08 at a level it's I guess incredible I've
38:11 never done it I'd love to do it I'd love
38:14 to do it on LSD quite frankly in a big
38:16 ass trip I've never done ayahuasca so
38:19 I've no opinion about that some people
38:21 smoke cigars in the dark you may not
38:23 know that but they smoked cigars in the
38:25 dark because they want this the flavours
38:28 to be the only thing that's happening
38:30 and so they get to see the cigar die
38:33 really intends to mention the scientific
38:37 dialogue in this film is phenomenal for
38:41 what it's trying to do and the
38:43 categories of dialogue that is trying to
38:44 tell it is second to none there have
38:47 been no movies that even remotely come
38:49 close to some of the philosophical like
38:52 monologues that go on in this film you
38:54 can just look up altered states
38:56 monologue in YouTube and you'll get a
38:59 dialogue by William Hurt at a bar
39:02 discussing the plot of the entire movie
39:05 just it's it's in the film I can get
39:09 through this one fairly quickly by
39:11 saying that he starts to succeed but
39:14 there's a catch he wants to go back
39:18 through the evolution of mankind and
39:21 it's an evolutionary type film so for
39:23 you folks and me you know you think
39:26 we're either dropped off by aliens or
39:27 God created us in a full state obviously
39:30 evolution has its problems but you know
39:32 go with it in this film because it has a
39:34 very interesting epiphany at the end and
39:37 I've recently talked about the ending
39:40 you know in an episode so some of you
39:42 know if you're coming to this fresh and
39:43 I won't spoil it for you in this episode
39:46 but he starts having effects he starts
39:49 having physical effects it's in the
39:51 trailer if you watch the movie he starts
39:54 regressing back while in this tank to
39:57 prehistoric man his bones change and
40:01 then he's sort of uh he's married in the
40:05 film actually he marries this girl he
40:07 has some kids then he kind of gets
40:09 estranged from her because he's well
40:10 he's like a Richard Feynman he's just
40:11 this handsome guy and he's just he's not
40:14 really into women for
40:16 the standard thing he's literally having
40:19 sex with his wife merely to have kids
40:21 and she talks about this she has a
40:24 beautiful dialogue about what it's like
40:25 to have sex with him because it's just
40:27 he goes she goes something like I don't
40:29 know if I'm making love or being impaled
40:31 by this man you know I mean she just
40:33 talks about it in such a psychological
40:36 manner it's really interesting but he's
40:38 off having sex as one of his students at
40:41 his apartment her hers or whatever and
40:43 he goes to the medicine cabinet there
40:46 goes the bathroom whatever and he's
40:48 looking in the mirror and he realizes
40:50 his arm is changing and it's right when
40:54 they came up with the bladder effect
40:55 where he could put a fake piece of skin
40:57 on your arm make you know with hair on
40:59 it and they could put a bladder
41:00 underneath that had air bubbles in it
41:02 and he could squeeze these little air
41:03 things and it would start rippling on
41:05 the side of the arm it's a big deal back
41:07 in the day back in 1980 and so he's
41:10 looking as armed he's like oh my god oh
41:12 my god look at this thing and so that's
41:15 pretty cool
41:16 a little special effect they did but it
41:18 goes further and further and further and
41:20 I'll tell you if I told you that he
41:23 succeeded which he does he gets the
41:25 answer me not telling you the answer
41:27 because the reason why you got to see
41:29 the film but it is a just a one-off of
41:34 amazing filmmaking and that is altered
41:39 states from 1980 the next one up was
41:43 made 1983 it's Natalie woods last film
41:45 she died in that boat accident off of
41:48 Catalina Island literally like 25 miles
41:51 from where I'm sitting maybe 30 with my
41:53 distance to the coast and it has
41:57 Christopher Walken Natalie Wood and
42:01 Christopher Walken are playing husband
42:02 and wife and the film starts out with
42:04 him in a laboratory with about 3 or 4
42:08 people it has the woman who plays the
42:09 Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over the
42:11 Cuckoo's Nest the beautiful Lewis
42:13 Fletcher when she was young she was very
42:16 really beautiful she's an amazing
42:19 actress everyone in this film is like at
42:22 the top notch of their acting
42:23 capabilities but he has invented a
42:26 mechanism that you can put on your head
42:28 and the very first ones really huge
42:30 ugly and it has all these sensors on it
42:32 and stuff it looks kind of goofy it's
42:33 actually Christopher Walken wearing it
42:35 is I believe the poster but he is in
42:41 this experiment where there's another
42:42 guy in the other room doing stuff and
42:45 they're feeding him all kinds of weird
42:46 food and he's trying to see if he can
42:49 feel it and so he's in his side
42:51 and he's got this contraption on and the
42:53 contraption records all five senses of
42:57 man completely takes over your entire
42:59 body if the other guy's happy or if he
43:02 runs and he gets his heart rate up your
43:04 heart rate goes up just sitting there
43:05 listening to it and it records it on
43:08 this beautiful tape that they invented
43:10 for the show it's like this wild
43:12 magnetic tape with kind of the petroleum
43:15 look on it's really super well done but
43:18 his wife is what we call a package
43:20 designer that's Natalie Wood what she
43:23 does is develop the the molding around a
43:29 particular object so let's say someone
43:31 creates the TV and they're like okay I
43:32 need you to make this thing look pretty
43:33 because people need to buy and put in
43:34 their house and so he comes to Natalie
43:37 and she's he says well I think what we
43:39 can do is we can take all these
43:40 mechanics that are over the head and
43:41 stick them in some suitcase or some off
43:45 you know out of room machine and then we
43:48 could just run the cord straight to this
43:49 thing and you could make a nice pretty
43:51 one just for the sensors touch sounds
43:53 like the VR crap we have no right
43:55 so she designs a beautiful version of it
43:58 and they're in the midst of this divorce
44:02 and there's one part I'm gonna share
44:05 because it won't change anything but the
44:11 what starts happening in the film is
44:13 that Christopher Walken's characters
44:16 sort of naive he's like hey this is
44:19 great you know and the military's
44:20 interested in there's ratchets older
44:22 than him and she's like the military's
44:24 gonna take this thing over and they're
44:26 gonna do horrible things with it so
44:28 don't be so naive don't help them find
44:32 out anything about what we're doing keep
44:34 it all a big mystery to them and of
44:37 course it's devious government
44:39 beautifully played there's this guy in
44:41 this white suit is
44:42 be a [ __ ] man and he's running the
44:44 government side they start tapping into
44:46 the laboratory and so every feed that's
44:50 going on in a laboratory they've duped
44:51 it in another room or they're listening
44:53 it's almost like they'll police sting
44:55 kind of thing but it's this wild
44:56 three-dimensional tape stuff this $0.05
44:58 tape well the set up it goes like this
45:03 this is why you want to see this film
45:05 Louise Fletcher's character is working
45:11 at night trying to work on something she
45:12 has a heart problem they've revealed
45:14 this to you
45:15 they've also revealed that walkins you
45:18 know and this is midst of this divorce
45:20 his wife is actually dating somebody
45:21 else already he's kind of like dad
45:22 dammit that sucks you're right I gotta
45:24 see my wife at a party with this other
45:25 dude and I know the guy and he's a jerk
45:29 and walk it just destroys his role he's
45:31 just amazing in this role man the Nurse
45:34 Ratched is a smoker and she's reaching
45:37 for something in the middle of the night
45:39 and she hits her wrist on a soldering
45:42 iron it's hot burns herself and the
45:46 shock of that burn sends her heart into
45:50 cardiac arrest and she's got this little
45:53 metal box with her pills in it and she's
45:56 got to get the Box open and get a pill
45:57 in her mouth and you know put it
45:59 underneath her tongue or your salivary
46:01 gland is and it'll help her survive but
46:03 she drops the damn box
46:05 and she can't get down to it before the
46:09 cardiac arrest kills her she has a heart
46:11 attack but she puts the damn headset on
46:16 and records it the next day the military
46:22 uses her death to move in and sort of
46:24 take over the whole thing because
46:26 they're like okay see how dangerous this
46:27 is and this little renegade the
46:29 laboratory is just you know doing stuff
46:31 and this woman dying it's just that it's
46:35 a fake excuse but that's what the
46:36 government does right so walking is
46:39 sitting with one of these guys one of
46:41 his buddies he says help me um she was
46:45 putting this she was wearing this when
46:46 she died yeah you know help me play it
46:49 back okay I roll the tape back he puts
46:52 it on immediately
46:55 Christopher Walken starts having heart
46:57 attack in the other room or they're
47:01 monitoring this they have another guy
47:05 listening in this guy he was a part of
47:07 the original team he was kind of a
47:09 scumbag double double-dealin back
47:12 stabber right he's in the other room
47:14 listening to the tape now walking you
47:20 know they knocked the thing off his head
47:22 he's like oh my god my heart the other
47:25 guy keeps listening and he is having a
47:27 heart attack in the other room and his
47:29 government guys are just walking in the
47:30 background talk and he's just starting
47:32 to have this heart attack and the guy
47:33 dies and so they seize everything in the
47:38 laboratory he thinks he has the
47:40 jurisdiction but he doesn't they seize
47:41 the whole thing because the government
47:42 paid for it and they put it all the way
47:44 in this deep laboratory somewhere with
47:46 one of those robot arms as it grabs
47:48 tapes and puts it in a player and is all
47:49 remote-controlled stuff and they had
47:51 built the suitcase version which could
47:53 dial up through a modem and talk to the
47:55 tape it's a fantasy world where the bot
47:59 was strong enough to send five senses
48:01 which is sort of funny but now walking
48:04 says what if we disconnect the
48:06 respiratory thing take care of that
48:08 sense get rid of it play the other four
48:10 senses and so the goal of the movie is
48:16 walking wants to play the tape he wants
48:19 to find out what happened with that
48:21 machine on his head on her head right
48:27 now I'm gonna reveal one scene in the
48:29 middle of the film simply because it
48:32 won't affect the story at all it's this
48:34 word subplot that's actually beautiful
48:35 but the one of the things that
48:38 brainstorm has and I want you to notice
48:40 it when you see it because it is
48:41 something that I've never seen done
48:43 before I mentioned it when one episode
48:44 previously he's in the middle of his
48:47 divorce with his wife he's got a teenage
48:49 son and so you know in a divorce
48:53 situation half the time and you have
48:55 relationship issues it's just a
48:57 breakdown of communication right and if
49:00 you could just get the other person to
49:01 see what you see typically you could
49:04 resolve all your issues but we don't
49:05 have a mechanism to do that we just have
49:07 our words and
49:08 you know and then people don't know if
49:10 you're lying to him so you're intense
49:11 always questioned so he has this
49:14 epiphany living in this amazing house
49:16 they must have found this place it was
49:19 like some super eco-friendly house with
49:21 like a pool that goes in and out of the
49:23 house and it's just an amazing place but
49:25 he's been forced living the downstairs
49:27 area while she's living in the upstairs
49:28 area so as the night that she's packing
49:30 up all of her stuff to finally leave the
49:32 house something he's dreaded but he
49:37 takes the suitcase which is fully
49:38 contained it can record and playback all
49:40 by itself and he comes upstairs to
49:43 Natalie Wood who's just at the peak of
49:45 her absolute beauty I mean that girl was
49:48 phenomenally gorgeous and she was just
49:50 on her game when she died unfortunately
49:54 but he walks up there and she's like
49:56 what do you doin up here you're not
49:57 supposed to be up here get out of here
49:58 and he does the Chris day and you're
50:01 Christopher Walken he goes Shh and he
50:04 puts the suitcase down on the bed and he
50:08 pulls out the headset that she designed
50:10 and he puts it on her head and he pushes
50:13 play and then there's this gorgeous
50:16 montage of their life and she sits and
50:20 watches it it's every reason they
50:22 discovered each other fell in love with
50:24 each other
50:24 appreciated each other and despite his
50:27 intense work habit which has separated
50:30 them he still is able to communicate
50:32 because all the senses are there his
50:35 love for her the tape rolls out it's
50:41 over and she's sitting there with his
50:44 headset on and she looks at him and she
50:45 goes I didn't know boom they shack up
50:50 that night sleep together the kid finds
50:52 him under the sheets the next morning
50:53 they've like under with the light the
50:56 flashlight reading books to each other
50:57 and making love and the kids all happy
51:00 that the the marriages has been resolved
51:02 but that is a moment in time when
51:04 science fiction met love story in a way
51:06 that I have never seen it before I mean
51:09 yeah Luke Skywalker jumping across the
51:11 cavern in a on a Tarzan wire hands
51:14 pretty good but this one's better this
51:16 one's way better but the ending of this
51:17 film I have told you nothing about you
51:20 got to see it unbelievable
51:22 that's one of the huge heirlooms of my
51:24 family the next one in the list is
51:28 called dreamscape and this is the one
51:31 that few people have ever seen
51:33 1984 Dennis Quaid the guy from warriors
51:38 who Bing the little Miller Lite bottles
51:40 together and said what were yours
51:43 his name is David Patrick Kelly and he
51:47 plays a bad guy
51:48 what's dreamscape about very simply the
51:54 CIA has discovered a method to well
51:57 they've discovered individuals who have
51:59 a talent to get inside your dreams you
52:03 think you're dreaming they know they're
52:05 not and so they have Dennis Quaid is one
52:10 of the guys that can do it and this
52:12 David Patrick Kelly is a guy that can do
52:14 it
52:15 Dennis is interested in obviously using
52:19 it for good in this mr. Kelly guy he's
52:22 going to do hitman kind of [ __ ] with it
52:25 and so the idea is you get next to
52:27 someone who's sleeping you had to be in
52:29 the room next door room underneath or
52:31 above and you can get into their dreams
52:34 so they set up the premise for this and
52:36 it's really cool but now what's the plot
52:40 what are we doing here well the
52:42 President of the United States played by
52:45 this sort of good-hearted old old you
52:50 know kind of Midwestern kind of guy he
52:55 is having nightmares of a nuclear
52:59 apocalypse and so he is wanting to
53:03 disarm the United States of America
53:04 during the Cold War get rid of all of
53:07 our nuclear weapons leaving us prey to
53:11 the Russians and of course the Central
53:13 Intelligence Agency is not going to have
53:16 that happen and so they devised a plan
53:19 to have this David Patrick Kelly guy go
53:23 in and kill him in his dream and of
53:26 course Dennis Quaid's characters like I
53:28 got to save the president I've got to
53:31 show him that this is just a dream and
53:33 that we do need our arsenal so don't do
53:36 hoodoo
53:37 go crazy on us but you can imagine that
53:40 eventually the two guys meet in a dream
53:43 in the president's dream and this man
53:47 this David Patrick Kelly guy he he was
53:50 so on a roll being such the pinnacle bad
53:53 guy in the early 80s man late seventies
53:56 early eighties he has a way of using
54:02 your nightmares against you and he can
54:04 look at you and find your nightmares I
54:05 mean it's just awesome just awesome I
54:09 can eclis I found out that my writing
54:13 mentors former writing partner wrote
54:16 that movie very cool
54:19 there's not a gigantic takeaway from
54:21 that film it is just that you do have to
54:27 conquer your demons you have to own your
54:29 issues you have to explore your issues
54:31 because you could end up disarming you
54:33 know yourself out of some epiphany and
54:36 if you think about the way that the left
54:38 extremists left progressive nut bags in
54:41 this world are trying to disarm the
54:43 entire planet trying to get all of our
54:45 gender screwed up so we don't have any
54:47 kids trying to get us to surrender all
54:50 of our guns I mean it's all developing
54:53 these mental technologies to psych-out
54:56 human beings to give it all up every
55:00 single horrible ruler in the world has
55:04 done that just before they absolutely
55:06 screw over their people we can't afford
55:08 to have that happen those films gotta
55:11 kind of got that take away the other one
55:14 I'm going to end with because there are
55:18 other there are other films but I'm
55:21 trying to go for films that people don't
55:23 know exist now if you're a flat earther
55:28 and you haven't seen this film then go
55:30 spank yourself somewhere this last film
55:34 is called Dark City and ironically it
55:37 has William Hurt in it from altered
55:39 states it has Jennifer Connelly Kiefer
55:44 Sutherland and a guy named Rufus
55:49 so well SE wel L don't know quite a say
55:54 his name he's the main character Rufus
55:57 but it's about a guy who works for a
55:59 newspaper in this weird kind of Gotham
56:02 City sort of like a amalgamation of
56:06 every city that's sort of like New York
56:08 and it's nighttime in this city and it's
56:14 always nighttime in this city and at
56:18 night
56:19 well everyone goes to sleep it seems
56:22 like everyone goes to sleep at the same
56:23 exact time and our main character
56:29 doesn't go to sleep one night I can't
56:32 remember if there's something that
56:33 happens to him or he doesn't go to sleep
56:35 there's little pills you're supposed to
56:36 think I mean but he stays awake and when
56:41 everyone goes to sleep it's sort of like
56:43 The Day the Earth Stood Still cars that
56:47 are driving downtown because there's no
56:49 real distinction between day and night
56:50 because it's always night that's why
56:52 it's called dark city cars just stop
56:54 people stop talking at dinner tables in
56:58 diners sort of a bizarre timetable too
57:03 it's like you sort of feel like you're
57:04 in the 50s but old famous painting of
57:07 the diner which I think has like Marilyn
57:10 Monroe in it or something like that sort
57:12 of like that era the world looks like
57:14 that anyway but the character the main
57:18 characters looking around like what the
57:19 hell just happened why isn't anyone
57:20 moving and the only character he can
57:25 find that still awake is Kiefer
57:26 Sutherland's character now Kiefer
57:29 Sutherland is sort of a weird guy he's
57:34 like a kind of a crazy person and he's
57:38 trying to communicate with that guy but
57:40 he is sort of elusive he he's talking in
57:43 riddles and he's laughing he's like oh
57:45 my god you just stayed awake boy do you
57:50 wait till you find out what's really
57:52 going on here sort of the gist of what
57:53 Kieffer's character saying and then he
57:56 sees these guys dressed in black trench
57:59 coats with these black hats on almost
58:02 identical to the
58:03 the conspiracy movie that's on YouTube
58:05 of the the two guys that walk in the
58:09 hotel with the black hats and the black
58:12 trench coats that are seemed to have
58:13 gigantic bodies but little tiny heads
58:15 it's on a surveillance video when they
58:19 interviewed everybody at the hotel they
58:20 said oh yeah they were really strange
58:22 they didn't blink they were massive
58:25 bodies with small heads they almost
58:27 looked like twins
58:28 I mean it's a really weird story because
58:29 all these people from the hotel at least
58:32 three people gave testimony about seeing
58:34 these guys and they were looking for
58:35 someone who was staying at the hotel but
58:40 their guys like that and they start
58:43 moving people a bit like The Twilight
58:45 Zone which is what Groundhog Day spaced
58:48 on I forgot the name of it but they move
58:52 people around and they change them
58:54 change their positions so your dad might
58:57 be your uncle might be some other dude
58:59 the milkman is your dad or whatever as
59:01 soon as you wake up but some people are
59:04 the same he never changes his position
59:06 his boss doesn't change positions and
59:09 now unless he figures out that this is
59:12 happening he's looking forward to every
59:16 evening happening and trying to figure
59:17 out what the hell's going on but in the
59:20 meantime as he's awake he goes in and
59:23 talks to his boss and he's like dude do
59:26 you remember last time it was day well
59:30 of course he says win cuz it's night
59:33 right now and I'm at work what the hell
59:34 am i doing it it work at nighttime any
59:37 guys like you know he's like a host in
59:40 west water it doesn't look like anything
59:41 to me right he's like he's Cantlie
59:43 figured out but he's got all these
59:44 memories and then you realize just like
59:49 Truman Show that he has some
59:52 destinations outside the city that are
59:54 fabled to exist but he can't remember
59:56 really ever being there he tries to go
60:00 and he finds out he can't leave this
60:03 place it's like a video game and if you
60:05 played a video game for any length of
60:07 time especially without mmo's where you
60:10 can keep walking forever like a like a
60:12 fallout or stuff but even fallout has
60:14 these moments where you can't go any
60:16 further so you
60:17 go that way anymore but all video games
60:20 would block off every streets with
60:22 rubble there's a turned over truck right
60:24 there and you can't go that direction
60:25 it's sort of the way it is there's a
60:28 couple Twilight zones like that too
60:30 trying to figure out far I can go with
60:32 this one without spoiling it for you
60:33 guys that's pretty good set up what he
60:37 discovers is actually fundamental to our
60:39 question of sort of who are we and where
60:43 are we as the possum walks on the fence
60:46 over there
60:49 it's weird one of our listeners said I I
60:51 grew up in Huntington Beach I don't have
60:53 remember possums I'll say dude some
60:55 point we got infested with them because
60:57 they're all over the place but they're
60:59 so quiet and I only come out at night
61:02 but what he reveals is that I don't
61:07 think this will mess up anything for
61:08 interview and it's just a great movie
61:10 the ending is awesome into me the ending
61:14 for me the guy had me in his hand
61:16 whoever directed this thing whoever
61:18 wrote it right when the stuff starts
61:20 hitting the fan and the hero starts
61:22 becoming a hero and starting to kind of
61:24 solve this issue he I just had all the
61:29 goosebumps and edge of my seat feelings
61:32 that they want you to have so coming to
61:35 you as a writer
61:36 I hope you can appreciate that you'll
61:39 have that same experience probably but
61:44 we have this and this isn't the ending
61:47 when I'm about to say is not the ending
61:49 just so you know it's not what's going
61:50 on here but you know a lot of us say you
61:55 know we're trying to figure out the
61:56 shape of the world because NASA lies to
61:58 us all the time they've claimed to have
62:00 you know a thousand satellites so far
62:03 away from Earth but orbiting Earth they
62:06 should bill to give us a million
62:06 pictures of Earth every single day of
62:08 our lives they can't produce one it's
62:10 not a composite the guy at NASA says
62:11 pictures of Earth have to be a composite
62:13 they have to be a composite it's a
62:16 composite they have to be great that's
62:17 their official video it's their official
62:19 information but there's that matrix team
62:23 the matrix folks that are kind of like
62:25 well if it's a matrix we could be
62:28 anywhere
62:30 now hopefully you realize that the guys
62:33 in black are the ones in control but
62:36 their objective is pretty cerebral and I
62:39 think it took me to times seeing the
62:41 film before I really understood the
62:43 depth of what they were saying but it's
62:46 a great film a lot of people haven't
62:48 seen it I am willing to bet you could
62:50 get it for almost nothing
62:51 if you rendered a to be 399 but for
62:55 those of us who've seen it it it really
63:00 does grow on you
63:03 over time it's a brilliant little piece
63:05 of filmmaking now it occurred to me
63:08 while I'm talking here that there's
63:10 another movie that I don't know if it
63:11 has quite the quite the attribute of not
63:16 being seen or having been forgotten but
63:19 the original body-snatchers is pretty
63:21 cool I just mentioned Kiefer southern I
63:23 thought about his father and Donald
63:27 Sutherland he's in the very first Body
63:29 Snatchers and it's the old it's a remake
63:31 from the original but the they didn't I
63:34 think the 70s I'll look it up
63:40 yeah 1978 that's what it says here it's
63:45 shot in San Francisco as a matter of
63:47 fact so I I hadn't seen it for a long
63:50 time and I'd lived in the barrier for 12
63:52 years and then moved back down here to
63:53 Southern California then I saw it again
63:54 down here and it's all like Pier 39 and
63:58 all this crazy stuff but it is a really
64:02 well done film where these pods are
64:04 falling out of space and they are
64:06 replicating us and so they kill you and
64:09 then they replicates you in these pods
64:11 and then of course the replicant walks
64:13 around and can't speak English and is
64:16 sort of like this creature that can make
64:20 more of these folks right they'll kill
64:21 you and there's part of the process of
64:23 the ecosystem is taking over Earth by
64:25 these sort of organic human creatures it
64:27 doesn't have a giant take away that
64:30 would be part of our truth bit or
64:31 anything but it's definitely good for
64:32 them but here's what's interesting now
64:35 pulling back from these movies for me
64:38 these films in part not all of the films
64:42 I mentioned but
64:43 I think forbidden planets so the Day the
64:45 Earth Stood Still I think rollerball and
64:49 probably brainstorm at least we're
64:54 talking about some of the greatest
64:56 moments in filmmaking especially science
64:59 fiction filmmaking which usually don't
65:00 draw on the females but it is a point
65:05 where our artists / writers slash
65:09 filmmakers actors all these individuals
65:12 working together to pull these things
65:13 off the people who do the scores half
65:15 the time rate they are seeing the future
65:19 they are super enlightened people that
65:23 you know if I told you okay well the you
65:25 know the Day the Earth Stood Still is
65:27 about an alien that comes down with all
65:28 the information we're stupid we shoot it
65:30 we kill it then he stops the earth to
65:32 teach everybody a lesson and get
65:33 everyone on the same page you're like
65:35 yeah whatever it's but done a million
65:36 times but this is 1951 so first time
65:39 it's been done like that now still
65:42 stories written stories and books and
65:45 these sci-fi rags that used to be back
65:47 in those days probably of testimony
65:50 before the film was made I just haven't
65:52 read everything in the worlds I don't
65:53 know but the insightfulness is the
65:57 creativity to have a medium that is
66:01 traveling to another planet and me
66:02 imagine someone says a and we need a
66:04 sci-fi family member might a sci-fi film
66:05 okay yeah sure whatever
66:07 and of course back in the 50s you hit X
66:09 minus one mm plus you had tons of sci-fi
66:12 rags that were being published out of
66:14 Los Angeles in New York and some of the
66:17 best writers in the world Robert
66:18 Heinlein Asimov Ray Bradbury philip k
66:22 dick was coming online around that time
66:23 you know everyone who wrote the Twilight
66:26 zones Charles Beaumont Earl hammer Rod
66:28 Serling all these amazing writers are
66:32 cranking this stuff out left and right
66:34 we do have that DNA still to this day
66:37 just the writing on West world alone to
66:40 prove something to you the writing on
66:41 Black Mirror should be phenomenal I
66:43 haven't seen any of the new Twilight
66:44 zones and almost I almost need the
66:47 Twilight Zone reboot which is like the
66:49 third or fourth reboot to work before I
66:51 go in because
66:53 I'd hate to be disappointed Amazon paid
66:56 for a reboot of a lot of philip k dick
66:58 novels and i tried to watch it and it's
67:01 just such a let's just put this way
67:04 without criticizing it i will just
67:06 simply say black mirror is so blowing
67:08 that show away it's hard to watch
67:09 anything less than black mirror with
67:13 rollerball i'm sitting here watching it
67:15 come true I'm living it you're living it
67:19 the trying to kill the individual
67:23 they're trying to use corporations as
67:26 the savior mechanisms right
67:28 Apple Computer is gonna save the [ __ ]
67:30 world right the Notre Dame burns down
67:32 and they put that's something I'm gonna
67:34 help rebuild don't you're dumb what the
67:35 whole place is being retrofitted for
67:36 like six point five million and now
67:38 they've raised three billion dollars to
67:40 rebuild Oh chewed on hey I want the
67:42 place rebuilt to don't don't get me
67:43 wrong
67:44 thank God the sixteen Chapel Sistine
67:46 Chapel excuse me did not burn down
67:48 Michelangelo's artwork that would be
67:51 blasphemous to the history of this world
67:54 it ain't just a building I have a whole
67:58 series on screenwriting in this channel
68:02 I haven't done a new one in a really
68:03 long time I probably will hear shortly
68:06 do another probably just recap on how to
68:10 write one quickly who to go to to get
68:12 educated and then some of the just some
68:16 of the mechanisms that I haven't found
68:17 being Todd it's like they all want to
68:19 covet something about screenwriting it
68:21 just pisses me off they just want to be
68:23 the only guys in town that can do it and
68:25 it's like you know how many stories
68:26 we're missing because people aren't
68:27 writing stories that they have because
68:29 they don't know how to do it when I
68:31 write something typically I'm trying to
68:33 write some very meaningful things no
68:35 matter what script I'm writing whether
68:37 it's a dramatic comedy which I just
68:40 finished a new one I really want you to
68:42 get something out of it morally and and
68:44 for you to see yourself in it I think
68:48 Tron and Blade Runner of which two
68:49 movies I don't need to mention because
68:51 they're so well absorbed by the
68:52 audience's out there if you haven't seen
68:55 the 1982 Tron as Jeff Bridges in it and
68:58 Bruce Boxleitner I mean David Warner I
69:01 mean some just phenomenally legendary
69:03 actors if you haven't seen it I mean it
69:05 really shows you this relationship for
69:08 those of you who believe in the matrix
69:10 and again Tron Legacy has none of this
69:12 so spare me it's a pretty film it sounds
69:16 great but the story was abysmal which is
69:19 why the reboot is having such a hard
69:21 time there sorry the sequel I'm here to
69:26 tell you the Tron 3 if it happens it'll
69:28 be a reboot it'll just be called three
69:30 would be why we call it a different name
69:31 but I don't know if you can reboot that
69:33 franchise in the modern day I posted my
69:36 version of Tron 3 the screenplay on the
69:39 Facebook group in case any of you want
69:40 to read it I'm gonna read some of my
69:42 writing so Tron just to finish that up
69:44 you know it's it's big contribution is
69:47 this relationship between programmers
69:50 which are considered gods and the user
69:54 sorry which are called users and the
69:55 programs that are not inside the
69:57 computer so they they don't have
70:00 knowledge of what our world is like and
70:03 so they think we're gods and so when
70:05 Jeff Bridges goes inside the computer
70:07 he's a God he's a user but he conceals
70:10 that because he knows they're gonna
70:11 freak out if he tells them Bladerunner I
70:15 don't know if it has a gigantic take
70:17 away definitely probably not as profound
70:20 as Tron 1982 but Blade Runner is one of
70:24 the most beautiful films ever created
70:26 ever it is so strong for a completely
70:30 different reason Tron 82 is sort of your
70:34 amalgamation of you know Steve and Liz
70:39 Berger who wrote and directed it had Liz
70:41 Berger studios in Boston he moves it to
70:43 Venice Beach he ran that for ten years
70:45 he was doing all your bubblicious
70:46 commercials all the McDonald's
70:49 commercials he was sort of revered
70:52 inside the Disney franchise as being the
70:54 next Walt Disney and I can tell you
70:57 that's probably what would have been the
70:58 case how they endorsed him fully but it
71:02 had Alan Shaw Richard Taylor you know
71:08 you know a lot of these guys were super
71:10 good friends of mine bill crier
71:14 I mean there's just countless people I'm
71:15 missing all these amazing people that
71:17 contributed to that film it's the first
71:19 three dementia
71:20 CGT film with live-action mixed with it
71:22 it didn't happen again until I believe
71:26 Terminator 2 so you're seeing the reason
71:31 why it's beautiful is because you have
71:32 all these guys from the 60s and 70s that
71:35 are at the top of their game creating a
71:38 product that is the very top of their
71:41 youthful minds some of the most
71:43 beautiful interiors you've ever seen in
71:45 CG has Syd Mead and Mobius from from
71:51 France the the crazy heavy metal artists
71:54 you know heavy metals movie you got a
71:56 situ but it's a bunch of schizo it
71:58 doesn't really apply to this episode see
72:00 the best to look to the most incredible
72:02 designers in the world designing all
72:04 your visuals you have this incredible
72:07 mind of lists Berger who wrote the film
72:10 little piece of trivia this is gonna be
72:14 a piece of trivia that I think needs to
72:17 be exposed I won't say how I figured
72:19 this out but the the screenplay of Tron
72:23 to our Tron C return in 1982 has two
72:26 credits on it it was only written by one
72:29 person and he directed and wrote the
72:32 film the reason why there's two credits
72:34 on it is that the day that it was
72:35 copyrighted with the Writers Guild of
72:37 America the person who carried the
72:40 script to the registration office put
72:43 their name on it unbelievable balls on
72:48 this chick she did not write that film
72:51 alright that film has we have the
72:56 complete proof of its lynnie lineage it
72:59 was written over five years at the lists
73:01 burger studios and we have a notebook
73:06 with all the proof that this grip was
73:09 completely flushed out I mean yeah
73:11 there's a little technical things here
73:12 people massage something here and there
73:14 so at most you might have an additional
73:16 writing credit but definitely not a
73:18 principal writing credit suppose only
73:20 one dude who wrote that film and he's
73:23 written 20 films since then okay
73:25 the Blade Runner another Syd Mead
73:28 creation said B probably did 80% of the
73:31 artwork the other artists
73:33 we're badass artists I mean they got to
73:35 do that their Deckard's gun most of the
73:38 branding in the movie is the original
73:41 branding not the coca-cola and the Pan
73:44 Am that's in it but well the other cool
73:46 sort of renegade symbolism was done by
73:50 these other artists and they did a
73:51 phenomenal job for them interpreting
73:53 SIDS art work sometimes they couldn't
73:56 afford to do it all so you know they
73:58 make modifications to it the same thing
74:00 happened to SIDS work in 1982 but that's
74:04 an heirloom of filmmaking it'll never be
74:07 made like that again tron 1982 will
74:09 never be made again like that again and
74:11 we wouldn't want to make it the
74:12 old-fashioned way but some of the frames
74:15 in Tron 1982 just as a little bonus
74:18 round for you guys on this episode have
74:21 28 frames of clear coda lists I think
74:26 it's the way you say it but it's just
74:27 clear plastic that they would put
74:30 various elements on and so they would
74:32 stack up I think the minimum frame has
74:36 about eight layers of this stuff and the
74:40 most advanced frame when you have what
74:43 is it bridges is character Flynn is
74:45 kissing Yuri inside the computer just as
74:48 he leaves with the master control
74:49 program swirling in the background it's
74:51 this beautiful scene where they're
74:52 kissing
74:53 I believe that goes all the way up to 28
74:55 layers of this coat Allah stuff where
74:58 they're painting their eyes and their
74:59 teeth separate and you know the whole
75:01 thing was filmed in black and white and
75:03 so then they that allowed them to color
75:05 things but the meticulous hands-on
75:09 crafting of all the suits the circuitry
75:11 all that was done by hand
75:12 utterly phenomenal yeah I mean I I just
75:16 want to inspire you guys to go take a
75:17 look at these films I'm putting this in
75:19 the normal count of the episodes because
75:20 I think it's a it's something that
75:23 should these movies have standing the
75:25 test of time all I've done is
75:26 plagiarized them in this episode I think
75:28 that you should see all of these films
75:31 if you're a guy especially like science
75:33 fiction I do think most of them have
75:36 something you could take away from them
75:38 but I would love to hear your
75:39 suggestions one of the other ones I love
75:43 is the original Planet of the Apes with
75:45 the Rod Serling ending
75:47 unbelievable crazy amazing soundtrack
75:50 amazing amazing soundtrack now again I
75:53 didn't mention that because everyone's
75:55 seen that everyone's seen 2001 a Space
75:57 Odyssey most people have seen Clockwork
75:58 Orange so in all the Star Wars all the
76:03 star tracks everyone's already seen all
76:05 those so you don't need some guy telling
76:07 you to go see the obvious so hopefully
76:10 you enjoy those films go out and see him
76:12 let me know if you haven't seen them and
76:13 you do see them come back and let us
76:15 know what you thought about it try to
76:17 find the the greater details and I would
76:19 almost say unless you're gonna live
76:23 unless you're gonna see these films in a
76:24 very contained quarantine environment or
76:26 in your office your house kids are out
76:29 doing something the wife's content
76:32 she's cool into these films too or
76:33 whatever whatever the case is your
76:35 husband if your lady excuse me if you
76:40 can't see it in that type of quarantine
76:41 environment give yourself two watches
76:44 for whatever film you're gonna review
76:46 because there's more stuff in them
76:47 usually it's pretty cool so anyway if
76:51 you have made a deep thoughts radio.com
76:52 please go that's we're gonna get the
76:54 audio video you just want to do it ipod

78:31 expect everyone to completely be on
78:33 their best behavior all the time but boy
78:36 if we could make this a little practice
78:37 ground I think it'll help each one of us

78:47 meantime take care of yourself and
