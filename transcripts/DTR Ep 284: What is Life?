00:00 [Music]
00:33 welcome back ladies and gentlement the
00:35 deep thoughts so today I wanted to talk
00:38 about reality and life and what is life
00:44 it's so interesting that when we grow up
00:47 we have these opinions of simple
00:50 concepts like life well is just life
00:54 what's life Wow means you got a soul in
00:56 your awake well what's alive what's not
00:59 only well that chair is not alive you
01:03 know for a long time in my life it was
01:04 animals had no souls they just were
01:07 interesting little robots to entertain
01:10 us then there was the vegetarian
01:13 movement where things with eyes were
01:16 alive and things that had roots in the
01:19 ground that actually grew out of the
01:22 ground and bear fruit they're not alive
01:26 we don't worry about them they have no
01:28 consciousness they have no feelings they
01:30 have no pain and then there's the bias
01:32 of our own invention right we look in
01:37 the mirror and we say well what are we
01:39 it takes one to know one right but the
01:42 problem with it takes one to know one is
01:44 that we develop biases right we're so
01:48 sure of what we are we're so sure what
01:53 is what's really interesting is that
01:57 societies in the past have sort of
02:00 differed widely about what is alive and
02:03 what isn't alive what is the stage of
02:05 life that you and I live and what's the
02:08 stage that you live after your body dies
02:12 you know the Jim
02:13 Asians thought you continued your life
02:15 in the other realm you know you just
02:16 simply got on a boat you know after
02:19 Minnis supposedly unified north and
02:22 south Anubis went from being an
02:24 all-purpose God to a God with a very
02:26 specific river styxx job to get you to
02:29 the afterlife right
02:30 the Egyptians offered food and as the
02:33 food decayed in the bowl it is their
02:37 assertion that life is coming to eat of
02:40 the fruit eat of the vegetables it's not
02:43 rotting it's just that the life bearing
02:46 part of it has been taken from it some
02:49 Native American tribes believe that the
02:51 souls that had passed turned into the
02:54 stars we have a listener David who films
02:58 the stars if you want to see some
03:00 incredible star filming our locked
03:05 Facebook page has an amazing gallery but
03:09 he shares it doesn't look anything like
03:12 what they told us in astronomy the
03:15 distortions on the stars don't look
03:17 anything like a refracting atmosphere in
03:24 fact it doesn't even look like water
03:26 mm-hmm if you look at it for a couple
03:29 seconds for the very first time you're
03:30 gonna argue with me but the second you
03:32 fixate on it and look at it through his
03:35 camera and realize that he's painting
03:38 his camera round he's moving it around
03:39 so any anomaly in the sensor inside the
03:42 camera would travel with the bullseye
03:45 it's inside the camera but it doesn't
03:48 it's like three-dimensional structures
03:50 coming off these things that look like
03:53 me didn't look like you but it doesn't
03:56 look like a star so why have this
04:01 conversation about what is life it is
04:04 merely to split it out like a guy's
04:06 dropped a lot of acid now he's talking
04:09 about his backyard furniture moving no
04:13 here's my thread I want to pull with you
04:18 in this episode what if we extended
04:23 greatly our definition of what life
04:27 could be slash is how would that greatly
04:32 change or I shouldn't put a BIOS on how
04:35 would it change our definition of where
04:39 we are because we're all trying to
04:41 figure it out right
04:42 you know 99.9% of people I think just
04:45 live life they don't think about it but
04:46 we have fun on this show we have some of
04:48 you that are really studying the matrix
04:50 and I love the fact that there's a team
04:52 of you who are into that you know you're
04:55 studying anomalies that might be more
04:59 computer-based you know I know computers
05:04 inside and out I can think all the way
05:07 down to the silicon transistors that are
05:10 gating electrons into zeros and ones and
05:13 I still do not see a clear copy of our
05:18 reality being a computer right it can
05:21 only be a computer on a very existential
05:23 level of yeah I guess we could be zeros
05:27 and ones and some memory bank and 3d is
05:29 merely a simulation of a Cartesian
05:32 coordinate of zeros and ones at Papapa
05:34 but it doesn't really blend well but I'm
05:37 glad that you guys research that because
05:38 you guys might unlock it right there's
05:41 some of you that stay with the
05:45 heliocentric earth that has Pangaea
05:49 drift there's me I had heliocentric
05:52 earth expanding earth there's some of
05:55 you that are flat earth disk Flat Earth
05:57 turned up disk Flat Earth sort of semi
06:00 contact lens and then there's other
06:04 flavors but now what if we take a pause
06:07 when all this geometry and geology and
06:11 astronomy and simply say well thinking
06:16 about earth being a ball you're thinking
06:18 about earth being a disc but what if
06:19 earth was a living being hmm if that was
06:26 the case now what does that do needs to
06:33 think though earth lived on the back of
06:35 a turtle and why a turtle
06:39 you know you ever think that through for
06:41 a split second it was the old fable
06:43 question the someone like Copernicus or
06:48 Galileo was talking to an audience I
06:52 can't remember it was told him with the
06:53 Hawking books one of you of nabrit
06:56 someone's asking one of the prestigious
06:58 scientists of the universe quote-unquote
07:01 that he was wrong that the earth isn't
07:05 round it's on the back of a turtle and
07:07 he said dear miss what is a turtle
07:11 standing on if that is the case and she
07:13 said it's Turtles all the way down you
07:17 know turtle standing on turtle standing
07:19 on Turtles interesting right I suppose
07:23 it's because turtles we're known for
07:26 living hundreds of years right you know
07:29 if a turtle outlives you then it could
07:32 be a thousand years old right you never
07:35 know if it outlives two or three
07:37 generations because everyone's dying at
07:39 40 years old but the turtles gonna go
07:41 for a hundred and fifty why that turtle
07:45 seems like a wise old man doesn't it
07:46 what if everything was alive everything
07:52 exude 'add were used or routed life
07:58 force I mean everything what are the
08:03 frustrating things about vegetarianism
08:06 for me and there's several different
08:08 takes on vegetarianism and some of them
08:10 don't bother me at all if you get cancer
08:13 you should be vegetarian immediately
08:15 until you get completely in essentially
08:18 remission and deemed as cured is you're
08:21 gonna be right because cancer feeds on
08:25 red meat but I had a friend's daughter
08:31 tell me it didn't tell me personally but
08:34 just set it in the room and I'd never
08:36 heard it before which is I just can't
08:38 eat anything with eyeballs and right off
08:43 the bat it was very apparent that they
08:45 were trying to get an alkaloid for being
08:46 so empathetic to animals which is fine I
08:51 love animals
08:53 they're cute Iselle but I also loved
08:55 planes I'm utterly surrounded right now
09:00 by green as I've said several times on
09:02 the episode there's nothing that brings
09:04 me more calmness than being in this
09:08 environment plants that I water plants
09:11 that I have manicured plants that I'm in
09:13 a cure I look at them I feel a certain
09:16 way yeah some animals can do that for me
09:22 so I'm in a boulder too goddamn hyper I
09:24 love them too but it's more like I'm
09:27 looking for a big piece of candy in
09:29 terms of emotion right well here's
09:32 because I keep trying to parse that
09:34 because that one statement I've
09:37 mentioned a couple times on the show it
09:40 bothered me and it bothered me for two
09:42 reasons at face value I knew it was a
09:44 bunch of [ __ ] on my own brain I just
09:46 thought that's a crock of [ __ ] you can't
09:50 eat things with [ __ ] eyeballs give me
09:51 a break right but then a my retort to
09:54 myself was why do you think that so much
09:56 [ __ ]
09:57 and then I saw you know laboratory
10:00 experiments where they prove that the
10:03 plants have the full consciousness and
10:05 capability of dint affine specific human
10:09 beings they know when you're wearing a
10:11 lab coat versus when you don't wear a
10:13 lab coat they know an individual just
10:16 like we do and they basically killed a
10:20 plant in front of another plant in this
10:22 German laboratory it was all filmed and
10:24 they had an EKG on the one that survived
10:27 and it went bonkers and it never calmed
10:30 down after the death after the murder
10:32 they had two different lab techs come in
10:35 and clean up that plant it would kind of
10:37 crazy again but not quite as intense and
10:39 then they like a month go by where we
10:42 had taken away the friend and it never
10:43 really calmed down the way it was prior
10:45 to the murder but it had gone down yet
10:50 that was probably 5% activity and had
10:53 gone down to maybe 15% after about a
10:56 month but the person who did it this
10:59 heavier woman and a lab coat hadn't come
11:04 in contact with that
11:06 plant and they had these two that had
11:08 this young couple come and take care of
11:09 the first plant and treat it like gold
11:12 it was a nervous for a little while just
11:14 like a human being and after about 45
11:17 days the woman that tore the other plant
11:21 apart walked in and the [ __ ] EKG
11:24 floored and your view is of the EKG in
11:28 the in the viewing room and then the
11:29 two-way mirror into the the other plant
11:34 so you watched it with your own eyes
11:38 plants are alive they're conscious
11:41 completely plants outlive us by hundreds
11:46 and hundreds of years so let's let's
11:49 analyze this because yesterday it
11:51 finally dawned on me how to explain the
11:53 insanity of that [ __ ] cause life is
11:57 held together in this particular reality
12:00 by something that we call mathematics at
12:03 least for our physical state of being
12:05 right our $0.05 robot system that we
12:08 call a vessel through that I personally
12:13 believe we have a life force that flows
12:16 through us again my old analogy that I
12:20 created the season is a current of water
12:23 in a river it's right there in front of
12:25 you it's a little funnel someone is
12:28 dumping some blue died upstream the blue
12:32 dye comes down goes through the funnel
12:33 and then keeps going the vessel is the
12:36 funnel the soul is the blue dye it flows
12:41 through us that's my take that's my
12:44 physical model for you but if nothing
12:47 else
12:48 geometry and mathematics holds together
12:50 a pig and it also holds together a tree
12:55 now the pig you know it's pink makes a
12:59 little noises it's small and it's cute
13:01 when it's little they're intelligent
13:03 they little eyes and they taste good
13:06 when they fall on campfires but let's
13:10 just say someone wants to recognize a
13:12 pig as a pet I have a good friend of
13:15 mine who has a big pet loves it to death
13:19 okay how long was the pig gonna live I
13:22 don't know how long pigs live personally
13:24 20 20 years maybe in the Midwest I've
13:29 got friends of mine that had pet pigs
13:31 and they eat them after they get to a
13:34 certain age and I've known families that
13:37 used that as a method to teach their
13:39 kids the cycle of life tears start to
13:43 dry up once they smell bacon let me tell
13:45 you but now how long does the tree live
13:48 right how long does the geometry and the
13:53 consciousness that is a tree live like I
13:57 said in a recent episode Joshua trees
14:00 you know I haven't sat around to verify
14:03 that a Joshua tree is 4,500 years old
14:06 but I know that I grew up with them
14:09 being told being told that there were
14:11 plants that were alive back in 0 ad
14:17 2,000 year old trees I don't know how
14:21 long it takes a redwood to get this to
14:23 be you know the diameter of like 60 feet
14:26 they can drill a hole through and dry up
14:28 a semi through it I'm sure that takes a
14:30 few hundred years but even the youngest
14:34 tree every ring is a year right there's
14:39 150 200 year old trees in my hometown
14:41 all over the place right so what's more
14:44 alive
14:44 something's been live for 10 years dies
14:47 like a cat or a dog or a tree but have
14:53 seen the Civil War
14:56 scene man's entire insanity for 150
15:00 years we got no problem cutting down a
15:02 tree and building the table
15:03 building the house and there's hippies
15:06 the to hug trees I get it I get what
15:09 they do that now for a long time we
15:12 weren't replanting trees so we're
15:13 destroying the place Brazil just sold
15:16 off their whole goddamn forest at China
15:17 and then had the audacity to run some
15:20 goddamn global warming thing during the
15:22 Olympics Wow look over here look over
15:26 here right don't pay attention to our
15:28 lack of morality in the TV show West
15:31 world if you really
15:32 pay attention there's this question that
15:37 keeps coming especially what sees it -
15:39 this ain't gonna ruin anything for you
15:40 at all but the hosts are starting to get
15:44 to the point and they did this well
15:45 within season one and well within a
15:46 couple episodes where they're sort of
15:49 analyzing the fact that's like you
15:52 humans think you're real and you think
15:55 we're false why is that because you
15:58 participated in mocking your own
16:00 creation into us you didn't create
16:02 yourself you don't know who did
16:05 but in copying your own geometry and
16:08 your own sensibilities through
16:10 artificial intelligence this is all
16:13 fictitious of course you were able to
16:15 create us but somehow you didn't imbue
16:18 us with true life the rights and
16:21 sovereignty of being alive when you
16:24 cherish that so much and you died for it
16:27 in your own world
16:28 right when I wrote my version of Tron 3
16:32 there is a point when I have an
16:35 artificial intelligence ask a human
16:39 being was i real am i real are you real
16:44 was I good you know in the human who's a
16:48 genius in the script Kevin Flynn in my
16:54 script you can see in his face he
16:58 understands that he has had it wrong his
17:02 whole life that life is just as simple
17:07 as life can be it doesn't have to be
17:10 utterly complex does it do we debate the
17:16 life of a single cell being warmer
17:18 biology no it's alive right there's
17:22 barely anything going on you know if you
17:25 charge DARPA hey I want you to take the
17:29 single simplest single-cell bacteria
17:32 that you can find in all of history and
17:35 I want you to simulate that in a
17:38 computer make a model make a robot
17:40 whatever they'd be done in half a day
17:42 with all the intelligence that that
17:45 single cell being yes
17:46 because they have libraries already that
17:48 they could plug in but even if they had
17:50 to start from scratch
17:52 month maybe and then is that thing that
17:57 they created that mocks the bacteria not
17:59 alive just because we were the creators
18:02 all the sudden the grapefruit was
18:05 invented in the 1800s by crossing a
18:07 lemon and an orange and I never knew
18:11 that I never knew that two like two or
18:17 three years ago I thought grapefruits
18:20 we're normal but is a grapefruit not
18:23 real because we participated in a hybrid
18:25 situation no a Zinfandel walling right
18:31 it's a great that's been genetically
18:33 engineered to handle stronger weather
18:36 okay
18:38 so what is life there's life only things
18:42 that act like we do things that we can
18:47 communicate with on some level things
18:51 that are autonomous and can move and
18:53 aren't rooted to the ground hmm
18:57 then there's the hair-splitting right oh
18:59 well yeah that we don't we don't debate
19:03 that a tree is alive that's absurd
19:05 but it doesn't talk to us and doesn't
19:08 know language so it's not really alive
19:11 it's like how many conversations are you
19:14 having with [ __ ] dolphins buddy with
19:16 their huge brains we can teach gorillas
19:19 and chimpanzees and orangutans sign
19:23 language monkey see monkey do that's
19:26 much better
19:27 right but just because your dog can't
19:30 sit around and critique your choice and
19:34 socks doesn't mean it's not alive right
19:37 what if everything was alive your
19:41 computer was alive your dishwashers
19:43 alive and maybe it's just simply live
19:46 because it has been created by something
19:48 it has its own atomic structure whatever
19:52 that is
19:52 II throw winds currents whatever it is
19:55 there because you can pick it up it has
19:58 its own volume right
20:00 the chairs of my computers on that I'm
20:03 staring at right now well it's always
20:04 cement porch well because it's not
20:09 connected to my porch I'm gonna draw a
20:11 distinction between life of the porch
20:13 and life of the chair isn't it
20:16 interesting that people that hate
20:17 machines typically have problems with
20:19 machines there's a whole twilight zone
20:21 about it which Stephen King used to
20:25 grate Maximum Overdrive and Christine he
20:29 makes Christine with another one one of
20:31 the live broadcast ones a car that was
20:34 cursed
20:34 whoever bought it but anyway I've seen
20:40 it a hundred times people who hate
20:42 machines could never get into work and
20:43 when I come in the room being very
20:45 familiar with machines and not having
20:47 any anxiety because I look into them and
20:51 I can see them all the way through they
20:56 seem to like me okay I know it sounds
20:59 weird but I usually get something to
21:01 work fear and anxiety don't help
21:04 it could be law of attraction could be
21:07 one of sabotaging that machine with your
21:09 own projected reality right the other
21:11 thing I've been thinking about lately in
21:13 this realm is the movie The Shining /
21:17 the book The Shining there's a
21:19 conversation in the kitchen in that
21:20 movie between Scatman Crothers and the
21:22 kid mr. Halloran
21:26 is this character and he's explaining
21:30 the shining to the kid because the kids
21:32 kids shines right
21:34 it's a it's it's a multi-dimensional
21:36 power one of the powers is that they can
21:39 talk without ever opening their mouth
21:42 but then he says something really really
21:45 amazing that I I'm going to tell you
21:48 that there is some reality to it and I'm
21:52 gonna give you a couple examples well
21:54 it's very scientific that we've
21:57 sociologically developed over the years
21:59 in the 50s especially when we started
22:01 putting people inside skyscrapers and
22:03 treating them you know like it's
22:04 sardines in a can right but he says this
22:08 line he goes he goes it's like someone
22:12 when someone burns
22:14 host it leaves something behind and when
22:18 you walk in the room you know you can
22:20 smell the burnt toast even though you
22:22 can't see it it's not really on you or
22:25 anything toast is in the trash long gone
22:29 could be long gone with the garbage
22:31 truck but when you burn toast it leaves
22:34 that smell behind doesn't it
22:35 and he said the Overlook Hotel sort of
22:40 shines and it could give you images of
22:46 things that happened a long time ago and
22:48 during the finale of the movie Shelley
22:50 Duvall's character is going through the
22:52 memories of the hotel it's really freaky
22:57 and really weird
22:58 all these Eyes Wide Shut things going on
23:00 I mean Christ them film was made I think
23:03 in 76 or something like that 77 so I
23:07 like that and he was on it oh my god he
23:11 was ladies 79 I can remember
23:13 but now there's something called the
23:15 Hawthorne effect I believe that's his
23:17 name I was taught this as a young kid
23:19 thought all this cool crap when I was a
23:21 kid and even know where it came from but
23:24 the Hawthorne effect was the idea that
23:27 when you put a bunch of people in an
23:29 office and you make him sit in a certain
23:32 way and this it was going on in the
23:34 1800's where they had the slave shops
23:37 even accounting offices where everyone's
23:39 just sitting down staring and the desks
23:41 are all in a line like a classroom they
23:45 found that they found out that overtime
23:47 the employees efficiency would go down
23:52 the morality would go down their
23:54 happiness right and on some probably
23:59 serendipitous occasion we office change
24:02 the configuration of the desks and all
24:06 of a sudden the morale went up and the
24:09 productivity went up but nothing else
24:11 changed but the arrangement of the desks
24:14 and they later wrote papers about it and
24:18 did these psychological studies and they
24:20 they came up with this sort of I don't
24:24 know who's sort of a loose definition
24:26 I would say loosely based on reality
24:28 definition but a lot of the employees
24:31 said well the second theme of to our
24:33 desks we fat we we felt like the
24:36 employer cared about us hmm
24:40 maybe maybe that's part of it sure it's
24:43 a multi-dimensional effect no matter
24:45 what we think it's true not right until
24:47 the other day and I have noticed a
24:50 several times but I never really noticed
24:51 noticed it you know I had to make room
24:55 in my office for some new equipment that
24:57 I got need a soldering station and a
25:01 safe place for something to get really
25:02 hot I was full teach meteor mom my
25:05 supplies and all those other good stuff
25:08 and so I had to move around my desk and
25:11 I just ended up moving it a little bit
25:14 I'm talking like diagonally two feet
25:19 maybe and I saw her on a bookcase and
25:22 put it on the left side barely changed
25:26 anything but I'll be damned if when I
25:30 walked in my office it felt like a new
25:34 room it felt amazing like really
25:38 positive and I don't even think it was
25:42 really had to do with that new items I
25:44 had in the room because this wasn't my
25:45 focus it was just this ambient feeling
25:48 of the room now am I sitting here
25:51 thinking gosh the employer must really
25:52 care for me no it's my house I'm doing
25:56 it myself
25:57 I noticed that everything I was doing my
26:00 office all of a sudden became more
26:02 productive just being in my office all
26:04 day had less of that boredom attached to
26:08 it I was excited about it still AM
26:10 I enjoy it hmm well then I was started
26:15 thinking about these episodes I've been
26:17 making about Heathrow wins because what
26:19 I'm doing now every single day of my
26:21 life
26:22 every second of my life as I'm looking
26:24 around the world and envisioning the
26:30 currents of atomic wind that called
26:34 ether forming everything that I can see
26:38 both what I would define as living
26:41 mass and supposedly not living mass and
26:47 when I looked at my office and I thought
26:48 man I barely moved anything cosmetically
26:51 speaking it looks almost identical the
26:55 way it was before I took out an old desk
26:57 that fell apart made a little bit more
26:59 spacious but the part that's getting me
27:02 off is when I'm staring at the desk that
27:05 I simply moved a couple feet it wasn't
27:06 even two feet I can't even see the desk
27:09 behind me being gone I'm having this
27:12 amazing feeling and I thought maybe
27:16 maybe it relates to a little bit of this
27:18 notion of the shine that the atomic
27:22 winds of our existence have not only the
27:27 assertive winds that make us up hold us
27:34 together hold the desk in its form this
27:36 camera in its form but perhaps there is
27:38 a weaker stability that we cannot see
27:44 that holds our experiences echoes the
27:50 burnt toast smell right in that
27:53 particular region and by moving the desk
27:56 two feet I no longer sit in the same
28:00 place where I had been sitting for I
28:03 don't know three years by sitting two
28:08 feet over it's different it feels
28:11 different
28:13 have you ever swapped sides with your
28:15 spouse in bed all of a sudden it feels
28:18 like you're in a new world they feel new
28:21 on their three feet over you feel new on
28:24 your three feet over I can definitely
28:26 say it's happened to me it's almost like
28:28 an ether all indentation of current you
28:33 know when I give my analogy of the river
28:36 I'm talking about a very specific for
28:41 all intents and purposes violent
28:44 structure hi construct called a current
28:50 the rest of the water in this river
28:54 is just flowing from the high point to
28:56 the low point look at Lake Havasu or
28:59 your local pond yeah it could just sit
29:03 there he doesn't exactly sit there but
29:06 you know it's for the most part it's
29:07 just there life gets to form in a
29:10 particular way in a stagnant pool of
29:13 water roughly then life that forms in a
29:17 flowing stream of water because it's
29:22 hard to have a home when you're
29:24 constantly being moved so you need to be
29:25 life they could be on the move the
29:27 ecosystem of demands of nourishment has
29:30 to be satiated by the entire thing the
29:34 entire Mississippi River it would have
29:35 to provide ensure there's a rooted life
29:38 in the bottom the fish has to work hard
29:41 to stay in the same place on River but
29:44 in a pond many can make a little little
29:47 home somewhere on the bottom and stay
29:49 there much different rate human beings
29:52 have been anthropomorphizing inanimate
29:55 objects for years the movie Christine
29:59 like I just mentioned was actually a
30:01 fictional movie based on the book by
30:04 Stephen King based on a couple Twilight
30:07 zones where a boy named Arnie fell in
30:11 love with his 1958 Plymouth Fury which
30:15 was one overlooked badass car right the
30:18 57 Chevy when I grew up was the car you
30:20 always thought about when you thought
30:21 about 50s cars that in the 59 caddy and
30:26 once I saw the Plymouth Fury I was like
30:28 geez why did the 57 Chevy ever make it
30:30 to the top of that list but he falls in
30:34 love with this car and the fun thing
30:37 about the movie is that the car is alive
30:41 for whatever reason it gained his soul
30:44 and it was probably giving it to it by a
30:47 really dark force in the universe based
30:49 on what it does we sat in the audience
30:52 watching that because a lot of guys had
30:54 given their cars and names I have
30:58 objects in my house that feel like they
31:00 have life in them it wasn't that weird
31:03 my washer and dryer it feels like a
31:07 husband
31:08 if it for whatever reason in my mind the
31:11 washer seems like the man and the dryer
31:13 seems like the woman right he's doing
31:16 all the kind of cranky cold wet work and
31:20 she's like the she was like the womb who
31:23 warms it all up and dries it all out
31:25 she's that last step that goes oh it's
31:30 interesting as human beings when we
31:32 treat and treat a certain inanimate
31:35 object with respect meaning work
31:37 delicate with it we put it down
31:40 carefully we keep it clean we don't loan
31:44 it out to anybody it starts to develop
31:48 this sort of minor classification of a
31:51 living being inside of our minds it'll
31:54 never talk to you if it does go see a
31:57 doctor we struggle as human beings with
32:02 feeling inadequate and I think that that
32:05 might just be short-sighted there's this
32:10 sort of silent battle between the
32:12 flat-earthers and the heliocentric folks
32:15 and that the flat earthers say well
32:18 scientists and the global elite and
32:21 those aligned to us like NASA are simply
32:23 trying to make us all feel inadequate
32:27 infinitely small in the universe right
32:31 and their theory is to say well we're in
32:35 a firmament done with some sort and God
32:37 is right there got us with us and
32:39 therefore we are not insignificant I am
32:43 living proof that you can believe it's
32:46 round and still feel the exact same
32:48 beauty as the firmament dome I haven't
32:52 been in space I don't know what shape it
32:53 is but if everything shared a life force
32:57 and like my my office at every office
33:02 that's ever been rearranged or a bedroom
33:05 that was rearranged or a front room
33:07 that's rearranged when you remodel your
33:09 house can you knock out a wall and you
33:11 move the kitchen there and the pantry is
33:12 no longer this and that and you feel
33:15 bright and new and renewed any past that
33:20 you
33:21 it seems like it's not there anymore and
33:25 maybe you're a young couple and you
33:27 really fought for the first ten years
33:28 and then you rearranged your house when
33:31 you kind of calm down and it just seems
33:34 like it doesn't even look like that old
33:36 place that used to have those
33:37 disagreements and you feel better right
33:40 some people leave homes because they're
33:42 like man we just can't live in that
33:44 house
33:44 that's got too much bad blood I don't
33:46 remember that right it is interesting
33:50 that we define a female a life-giver
33:55 with all these attributes of giving life
33:58 of incubating up life holding it in her
34:01 bosom for not her bosom but I guess or
34:05 belly for nine months right there's a
34:08 distinction and the honor that we give
34:10 females but as far as I know only the
34:15 Native Americans have ever asserted for
34:17 us what second that earth itself was
34:21 alive and not even aware of an Egyptian
34:26 theory of that the nuke was the Stars
34:29 painted on her belly but the Native
34:32 Americans kind of figured it out that's
34:34 kind of cool but she does give us life
34:40 doesn't matter who designed this
34:42 universe and who keeps it together they
34:45 chose through design by design for us to
34:49 gain all of our faculties from the earth
34:54 right but we don't refer to the earth as
34:58 anything other than and an adamant ball
35:01 but let's think about the soul for one
35:03 second relatively speaking even though
35:07 there are giant shacks in the universe
35:10 or very tall and Andre the Giant's that
35:14 have skulls the size of huge pumpkins
35:17 right god bless that man if we are made
35:22 up of a life force that is our soul it
35:27 doesn't have to be that big to give us
35:30 full life
35:31 for the scientists that believe that the
35:34 brain equals our consciousness they have
35:38 a hard time when people get huge brain
35:40 injuries and they're fine you know
35:43 there's a medical condition where they
35:45 remove half of your brain
35:46 they have top of your brain like one
35:50 left or right hemisphere and the other
35:52 half has to learn the other half and all
35:53 this other stuff again one of my
35:56 grandmother students came back to her
35:59 he's a top gun he was a Top Gun pilot at
36:01 the time he was suffering from major
36:03 headaches and he told my grandmother he
36:06 says you know they did tests on me they
36:08 scanned in my brain and they found out
36:11 that it's really small inside my head
36:15 but I actually have almost the equal
36:18 amount of fluid in my brain that I do
36:20 brain matter
36:21 hit a miniature brain he goes but on top
36:26 of my class I'm a Top Gun pilot but
36:31 these headaches that got so bad I had to
36:33 be decommissioned kid was in his
36:35 mid-thirties or something he came to
36:38 visit my grandmother because he wasn't
36:39 sure which life he had left I don't know
36:41 what happened to this guy believe me
36:44 it's not something I could make up me
36:46 hit full consciousness there's that kid
36:49 that got shot by the shotgun the
36:51 gangbangers lost the whole frontal
36:53 frontal lobes they're gone well
36:56 according to science frontal lobes are
36:58 where we gain all of our true
36:59 discernment our true human qualities
37:02 right the bottom e's try to destroy the
37:07 frontal lobes and that's what makes you
37:08 Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over the
37:10 Cuckoo's Nest right but now what would
37:12 be the case if you had a
37:15 disproportionately gigantic being now
37:20 whales are huge but for what I
37:23 understand you know a lot of these being
37:26 the bigger the being the smaller the
37:28 brain sometimes sometimes they have
37:30 brains the size of walnuts you know
37:33 again a giant squid 50 feet long as a
37:39 brain that's a tube that you could slide
37:42 on your pee key if you were maybe a
37:45 six-foot man just an average pinky this
37:48 pinky ow my finger is about the size of
37:51 a giant squid brain hmm
37:54 squids are brilliant they don't live
37:56 that long
37:57 I think they live less than a year it's
38:00 weird with the earth need a big brain
38:04 what is the earth if it has a plasma
38:06 core what does it really look like in
38:09 relation to other things you know as it
38:11 is above so - it is below right it's a
38:14 spherical object let's just go with that
38:16 first what second it's got this sort of
38:20 electric core who knows what's actually
38:23 at this super centre if it's a spinning
38:25 electric core which would make sense
38:27 with the poles that we have then it's
38:29 this tube it's like this tornado of
38:32 plasma going down the center I don't
38:34 know kind of kind of feels like a human
38:38 cell a little bit but even human cells
38:40 they have a nucleus chest chromosomes
38:45 which are made of protein patterns which
38:49 then have double helix arrays of nucleic
38:52 acids
38:52 it's interesting how everything turns
38:55 into sort of a stringy substance protein
38:57 patterns are strings a protein
39:03 according to Stanford they fold faster
39:06 than the speed of light of course
39:08 according to Einstein that's impossible
39:11 DNA well it's a big long antennae of
39:14 connected molecules that are much bigger
39:16 than the protein molecules
39:19 I believe stars I think it's interesting
39:25 that we believe that science has figured
39:28 out a way to truly triangulate the
39:30 distance of stars using red shifts using
39:36 red shifts to figure out what they're
39:39 composed of red shifts to figure out how
39:41 big they are seems a little silly
39:44 doesn't it but we buy it how would we
39:48 change our behavior if suddenly we
39:52 figured out a way to see life force I
39:54 mean really see it like night-vision
39:57 goggles
39:58 I truly believe the reason why we can't
40:01 expand our view of energy is that the
40:08 only thing that we have allowed
40:11 ourselves to see is sort of an
40:15 electromagnetic or electro sensor
40:19 version of reality right photosensors so
40:24 we see the spectrum of light we have
40:27 photo sensors that we can you know point
40:30 at space and let it sit all night long
40:32 and come up with these cloudy stuff that
40:35 we call dark matter to fix the shitty
40:37 theory of the Big Bang right we can
40:40 measure again electrons and we can watch
40:47 atomic matter escape a collision inside
40:52 of a Collider but what would life force
40:55 be made out of maybe none of that stuff
41:00 and so how do you figure out how to make
41:03 a sensor to see something that you don't
41:07 understand and what are the
41:09 ramifications of having a giant portion
41:12 of the universe sustained in
41:14 consciousness is something you can't
41:17 observe you know in its literal form if
41:22 I am truly alive and you're witnessing
41:24 me through YouTube or even hearing my
41:26 voice it's evidence of my consciousness
41:30 but it is not the direct observation of
41:33 my consciousness right so let's see we
41:37 can sense consciousness and what's funny
41:41 is the greatest sensor of consciousness
41:45 is consciousness right let's just say we
41:51 go back to the old theory of what life
41:53 is and we say a kitchen table is not
41:57 alive it may have been alive at one
42:00 point if it's made of wood but it's been
42:01 severed from its food supply and so it
42:05 no longer has minerals and water
42:07 whatever it used to grow that's
42:11 we can look at that kitchen table we
42:14 don't sense it part of its because I
42:17 think we have a bias that we think it's
42:18 not alive in the first place
42:20 so it would be heavy heavy barrier to
42:22 cross to simply say you know what honey
42:25 what dear
42:27 I think the goddamn coffee tables alive
42:30 you know and your spouse looks at you
42:32 like don't make me divorce you but
42:37 you're pretty sure he or she is alive in
42:39 that response could we trust our own
42:44 vessel to be an instrument of science
42:49 we're not taught to do that right how
42:53 far away is that star hell if I know
42:56 pretty damn far it looks like to me
42:58 especially if it's what you think it is
43:00 which is a big ball of something in
43:02 space hydrogen helium whatever Eric
43:05 Dollard talked about the fact that the
43:10 Navy in their deep science laboratories
43:15 has essentially come to the conclusion
43:16 that light is instantaneous it has no
43:21 element of time it simply is instant and
43:24 so that when light happens in space none
43:28 of those explosions that supposedly were
43:30 looking at space are happening a long
43:31 time ago and making it to us they
43:33 happened the second that we're looking
43:35 at it or observing the now at all times
43:38 it's pretty interesting that they tell
43:40 us that light has a velocity we have
43:44 cameras that shoot what a million frames
43:46 a second and they shine lights through
43:50 coke bottles and they do all kinds of
43:53 wild experiments and you can according
43:55 to these cameras they see the you know
43:57 beginning middle and end of the light
43:59 traveling through the bottle hmm that's
44:04 pretty convincing good light has a
44:06 velocity at least through water but the
44:10 average human being for us it's
44:13 instantaneous because it goes so damn
44:14 fast and we can't get far enough away
44:16 from light to have it take a long time
44:19 to get to us right you know
44:23 if it does have a speed and the the
44:28 godfathers of electricity thought I had
44:30 a speed then I'm not sure exactly what
44:34 they're talking about
44:36 perhaps space is instantaneous it's a
44:40 longitudinal wave and not a transverse
44:42 wave then once it hits atmosphere it
44:44 starts to slow down and bump into things
44:46 so perhaps within the bubble that we're
44:48 in light has a relative speed imagine
44:51 that if light travels in a vacuum the
44:54 true vacuum it's instantaneous the
44:57 second it hits a medium of any kind you
45:00 measure the density of the medium and
45:03 that dictates the speed of light which
45:05 is why around the world the speed of
45:06 light has always been different it's
45:09 close but it's different all the
45:11 experiments of relativity general
45:13 relativity with clocks put them at the
45:17 clock at the top of the Eiffel Tower
45:18 clock at the bottom of the Eiffel Tower
45:20 and it gets off a little bit well
45:24 perhaps that's simply the medium that
45:26 the clock is using to measure time maybe
45:32 it's just strictly ether winds
45:34 metabolizing the clocks movement there's
45:36 more towards the surface less towards
45:38 the top because you throw winds a little
45:41 more dense at the bottom this is banging
45:43 around creating dielectric waves the one
45:47 idea of vegetarianism that makes a lot
45:51 of sense to me is the bearing of fruit
45:53 some vegetarians I think Steve Jobs is
45:56 one of these guys he said that I will
45:57 only eat fruit that is bared from a
45:59 plant because the theory is is that once
46:02 the Apple falls off the tree what does
46:04 it do it merely perishes and even if it
46:07 is the theory of the Egyptians where
46:09 Souls are coming down to feast on the
46:12 fruit there would be no sin and you as a
46:17 vessel consuming the same item right all
46:22 right that's cool I can get into that if
46:25 you don't pick a vegetable out of the
46:26 ground it just rots in the ground right
46:27 see you plant carrots when they mature
46:30 no they're just gonna die in the ground
46:32 if you don't pick them up and eat them
46:34 Mazal go for it
46:36 but that's still a life cycle of birth
46:40 and death and consumption or perhaps the
46:43 death due to the consumption same thing
46:46 with the pig it's just a lot cuter and
46:48 it answered for more phases into your
46:51 form of life and so you feel bad at one
46:54 point now I'm gonna make it real clear I
46:58 do not support in any way shape or form
47:01 these farms the excuse me these
47:04 factories that make animals that
47:07 genetically modify animals so that they
47:09 have no feathers and know if giant
47:13 breasts you know like these chickens
47:14 that they modify I don't 'funny that's
47:16 true but I would put it past him right
47:18 these people that are cruel to the
47:21 animals as they harvest them into forms
47:26 of food I by no means am into that right
47:29 now when you program computer software
47:31 for those of you have never done it and
47:35 you've never taken even a the splash
47:37 course of how to do this
47:39 most the software today is what we call
47:43 object-oriented software and you don't
47:46 need to know anything about that except
47:47 that we program software very much the
47:50 way life occurs to us right when you go
47:52 into your living room your TV's an
47:54 object and you turn it on and it uses a
47:57 signal its source to create a show that
48:00 shows a little object inside your TV
48:02 right okay but the way we make programs
48:09 run today is that we set up a bunch of
48:12 logic in memory a bunch of variables
48:15 that contain values at a bunch of
48:17 instructions that need to be fired when
48:19 certain things occur remember when you
48:21 turn on the light switch it's a machine
48:25 that is completing a circuit and that
48:28 turns on the light it lets electrons
48:29 flow to the light bulb whatever it's
48:32 made out of and it creates light you
48:34 flick it off
48:35 the machine turns off and it's a little
48:38 object in the wall it's doing this right
48:40 one software we write loops there is one
48:45 primary event loop and every piece of
48:48 software you used to do on your tell
48:49 phone in your computer in your TV and it
48:53 just sits there in loops waiting for you
48:55 to do something because it must ask the
48:58 question is the user doing something
49:01 that I need to respond to are they
49:03 turning the software on this is a bit of
49:06 notification from the main server that
49:08 your friend sent you and notice on
49:10 Instagram Oh yep there is so let's grab
49:13 that let's run a little piece of
49:15 subroutines that knows how to go to that
49:18 server grab that message put it on your
49:20 phone
49:21 flip the icon with a little number in it
49:23 put the notice up on your phone and then
49:26 it goes back into the loop waiting for
49:28 the next thing to occur which might be
49:30 you realizing you have a notification
49:32 you heard the bell and then you go in
49:34 and get it it runs your subroutines to
49:36 display that message to you all right
49:40 what's the human nervous system it's a
49:43 loop it's working hard all the time your
49:46 autonomic system well it keeps your
49:48 heart beating keeps your blood pumping
49:49 keeps you alive hmm what if the most
49:54 fundamental definition of life is any
49:58 loop in reality that sits in waits for
50:01 an action to occur and has subroutines
50:05 that it fires as a result of that action
50:08 taking place now the old software before
50:12 we went to object-oriented software it
50:15 in the software didn't necessarily have
50:18 a loop but the computer had a loop the
50:22 computer was sitting there waiting for
50:23 you to give it a command that then it
50:26 could tell the software all they press
50:28 the number one key do whatever you do
50:30 when you hear a number one happen and
50:32 then it would execute but the loop was
50:34 just outside the software there's been a
50:37 lot of interesting science-fiction
50:39 stories about robots gaining sentient
50:42 life quote-unquote and society having to
50:46 step in and give it the recognition of
50:48 life right the fictional character data
50:51 in the Star Trek next generations was
50:56 always dealing with this they even had a
50:58 court case as to whether or not the what
51:01 is a Starfleet could take the
51:03 get back to earth and dissect him to
51:04 figure out how he's created so they
51:06 could create more of him then he fought
51:09 for his own sovereignty one if robots
51:12 still if robots keep going in the way
51:15 that we have them going today regardless
51:18 of how remedial their logic might be
51:20 whether Allah doesn't matter we won't go
51:23 into it but regardless of what they do
51:25 we as human beings will probably get to
51:29 a point where we start trying to write
51:32 rules about what life is but I'm gonna
51:37 tell you right now in its most
51:38 fundamental sense it is anything that
51:40 has a loop that waits for an action your
51:44 applications and your telephones are
51:47 program life forms just like the movie
51:50 Tron in 1982 there's some of us in
51:53 Computer Engineering when we saw Tron in
52:00 1982 I believe August the sheer
52:05 brilliance of what Steven lists burger
52:07 did when writing that film still shocks
52:11 us to this day because when you watch
52:15 2001 a Space Odyssey approximately 12
52:19 years earlier you had the Hal 9000 that
52:22 ran the Odyssey spaceship and it was so
52:24 human it was so in the future I suppose
52:27 we 2001 which is kind of funny that the
52:30 adoption of whether or not that thing is
52:31 alive or not was much easier because the
52:35 only thing it lacked was a vessel that
52:36 looked like a human being
52:37 it was reading lips that's pretty
52:41 brilliant humans don't do that on
52:43 average right for those of you who
52:45 haven't seen Tron ever which is a lot of
52:48 you a human being is pulled into a
52:51 computer in every program and that
52:53 computer was a human being but they
52:56 called themselves programs and they
52:59 called human beings users and they
53:02 revered users as gods because they
53:05 recognized that humans wrote them and
53:09 according to the program's the users had
53:13 a plan it was a deterministic universe
53:16 for
53:16 well if you're a user then all this has
53:20 been according to a plan was one of the
53:22 lines spoken by the main character Tron
53:24 2 which Jeff Bridges replied you wish
53:28 which was really confusing and probably
53:31 demoralizing to Tron because he's like
53:34 don't tell me this is all random man
53:37 that I could just die because I just
53:40 died but that's the way Stephen wrote it
53:44 by the way I'm gonna give you a little
53:46 Paul Harvey on the credits for Tron it
53:50 should be told somewhere in history
53:52 there's a co credit to the writing of
53:55 Tron I forget the lady's name the way
53:58 that she got her name on the script was
54:00 the following Stephen wrote the script a
54:05 lot of people contributed to the
54:07 thinking of various takes on the script
54:10 but Stephen wrote the script at one
54:14 point the studio was almost done making
54:16 the movie and they said by the way did
54:17 you copyright the script and he said no
54:21 not really
54:21 you know they steal your stuff and they
54:24 go well you got to get a copyrighted so
54:26 Stephens busy making the film he's in
54:28 post-production he makes a phone call to
54:30 his assistant this woman and says hey
54:32 could you get the script off my desk and
54:34 register it with the WGA the Writers
54:37 Guild of America she grabbed the script
54:41 her own [ __ ] name on it as a co-writer
54:44 and registered the script and therefore
54:47 for the rest of time she gets a co
54:49 credit for writing Tron she didn't write
54:52 Tron ok so imagine society matures to
54:57 the point I'm suggesting in this episode
55:00 where we start to recognize anything
55:02 with a loop of logic a loop that
55:05 associates itself with logical commands
55:08 of some sort giving it form and
55:10 definition life
55:12 well imagine all of the problems we had
55:15 in the last 200 years granting rights to
55:19 human beings of different colors people
55:22 had to fight to be recognized as human
55:25 beings who are most definitely human
55:28 beings
55:30 interesting right so some point i mean
55:35 if you want to run a sci-fi script based
55:37 on this go right ahead a good black
55:39 mirror it's been done right it's been
55:43 done in Star Trek like I said but the
55:46 notion is we would have to at some point
55:50 afford any definition of life regardless
55:54 of how meager that life might be either
55:57 no rights or rights and then we'd have
55:59 to figure out a science around it the
56:02 single-celled bacteria I opened the show
56:04 with well it exists but it unknowingly
56:09 might kill mankind hmm we don't want to
56:16 give deadly viruses rights because we
56:22 have to protect our own existence okay
56:25 we have virus protection software on our
56:28 computers right well if we were to say
56:30 that the virus that's sitting around
56:32 waiting in a loop hiding out for the
56:36 year 2000 heading out for some
56:39 eventualities something you might
56:42 trigger its creator has created a
56:44 monster what's going to erase your hard
56:47 drive eat up while your processor power
56:49 and basically do harm well if your when
56:53 your virus protection software and it
56:54 finds a macro inside a word file that's
56:56 been mailed to buy some spammer from
56:58 China or Russia it gets rid of it
57:01 doesn't it it quarantines it and deletes
57:03 its existence interesting so we'd have
57:07 to figure out a way to certify software
57:10 life is it possible for this piece of
57:13 software to do you harm by itself even
57:18 if you provoked it right we have laws in
57:21 the world at most places that are first
57:24 world countries that you're not allowed
57:25 to have exotic dangerous animals on your
57:28 property I can't have a bangle tiger in
57:31 the backyard in Huntington Beach I can't
57:33 even have a ferret or a raccoon as a pet
57:36 because it could carry rabies or it
57:39 could kill me the tiger could bite my
57:42 neck
57:43 it was a Siegfried and Roy whatever his
57:45 name was one of them got bit in the neck
57:47 and ran off luckily the guy lived but
57:52 that's why you can't have those things
57:54 but we don't go and kill all the tigers
57:56 in the world because we recognized them
57:59 as indigenous life beings that were here
58:01 before a man was here or here just
58:04 alongside men so we have this
58:07 interesting jurisdiction in our brains
58:09 that we try not to be the beings that
58:15 cause extinction events in animals lives
58:18 right people do forget that old fact
58:23 that's basically that most of the
58:28 extinction that has occurred on this
58:29 planet has happened naturally but for
58:33 every life force that goes away every
58:35 distinction that goes away and those at
58:37 the class phylum Kingdom era or area of
58:41 life another one is reborn or created
58:44 right a subspecies of something so one
58:47 ant goes away another ant shows up our
58:53 hubris of being able to control this is
58:55 really hysterical right so hopefully
58:59 this has given you some food for thought
59:01 what is life how would you know if we
59:08 can't sense consciousness and any form
59:12 other than other than to observe it with
59:14 our own biases just like we can't see
59:18 most of the light that exists in the
59:21 universe with our human eyeballs after
59:24 use equipment to see it
59:25 well maybe we haven't found equipment to
59:28 see all the other life you know I've
59:32 heard conversations where people angst
59:34 over the notion of you know believing
59:37 that your loved ones exist around you
59:39 after death which I believe is very much
59:42 the case I don't know how long they do
59:44 it but they can but what if we turn this
59:47 machine on and they're all over the
59:48 place that might be a little freaky
59:52 right who are these beings right the
59:56 free
59:56 he footage that NASA supposedly shot of
60:00 the shuttle doing experiment where they
60:02 put out a big wire to see how much
60:07 ambient electricity that you create with
60:09 probably no 350 mile up Van Allen belt
60:13 radiation and the whole thing vaporized
60:16 and separated and they realized a lot of
60:19 Energy's up there okay but there's these
60:23 look like these flying discs all over
60:25 the place interesting they seem to swim
60:28 around with logic and not like dust
60:30 particles changing directions it's all
60:33 that weird footage of these balls of
60:36 light coming towards the Earth's
60:38 atmosphere and bouncing off what look
60:42 like lasers being shot from the surface
60:44 of the earth up scaring these things
60:47 away I mean you know it gets really
60:50 weird weird very very quickly and the
60:53 other notion that we must consider
60:56 is that we see all that we need to see
60:59 all that we're really capable of
61:02 comprehending perhaps the reason why we
61:05 don't see things that are there is that
61:10 we don't know how to comprehend it then
61:12 it might freak us out completely nobody
61:15 wants to be freaked out you know like
61:18 it's like the movie ghostbusters when
61:20 everything gets really hot and they're
61:22 flying all over New York City okay you
61:26 want to have that every single day
61:27 driving down the street and you don't
61:29 know if you're swerving away from a
61:31 human or an apparition of a human I
61:34 think they get really disconcerting very
61:37 quickly is the pilot in the plane or is
61:40 that a ghost of a pilot in the plane
61:42 yeah it kind of begs the question are we
61:46 playing with fire in some areas of
61:49 philosophy and enlightenment mm-hmm I
61:53 guess we need to make some pretty
61:55 enlightened human beings to stick their
61:56 head in the yeah to look at the engine
61:59 of the krill as they sit in Forbidden
62:01 Planet get our mind blown and then come
62:05 back to reality and go okay okay okay
62:07 yeah that's probably pretty good that
62:08 were
62:09 the way we are those who take DMT and
62:13 eventually they report back yeah I'm
62:15 pretty happy to be human and I'm pretty
62:16 happy to be right here right now with
62:18 you guys don't need to meet my alien
62:21 host again I'm done ten times was enough
62:25 or whatever the number might be I think
62:29 you feel me
62:31 this one just crept up on me because I
62:34 feel like there's this mezzanine between
62:37 what we are and what the universe might
62:40 be and we don't it's very difficult to
62:44 describe right I've struggled in this
62:46 episode to put it together I'm
62:49 interested in your comments your
62:53 impressions your experiences in this
62:55 whole realm and by the way for those of
62:57 you are big readers of fictional stuff I
63:00 don't get a lot of time to read
63:01 fictional things if you have books and
63:04 things that kind of get into this a lot
63:05 of you do recommend stuff for me and I
63:07 go out and take a look at the best of my
63:08 ability I go and put that in the
63:11 comments too because that's kind of cool
63:12 come to the Facebook group and share a
63:15 link especially like a video link it's
63:18 much better when you share it in
63:19 facebook even though facebook is a bunch
63:21 of as we have heard in our recent Senate
63:25 hearings you know heavily censored and
63:28 controlled and manipulated and sold off
63:30 to everyone else but it is unfortunately
63:34 a good way to see the thumbnails of what
63:36 you share and so if you like if you
63:38 share a link in YouTube I just get the
63:41 link and no one actually sees the
63:42 preview you think you'd think that
63:44 YouTube who owns YouTube would be able
63:47 to create some sort of video preview in
63:50 the frickin comment section right I
63:51 think they're trying to be careful about
63:54 how many instances of videos players
63:55 they install on one page but something
63:58 they could do the thumbnail which won't
64:01 load anything until you say play
64:02 thumbnail goes away will be replaces it
64:05 boom we can see what's going on right
64:06 inside this section but they don't do
64:07 that
64:08 so again Facebook is probably the best
64:10 place to do it but the place you find
64:13 all the links is deeps who's about to
64:16 say deep space com
64:18 Wow deep thoughts calm the videos there
64:21 the audio is there the lock
64:23 but group and the patreon I'm playing
64:26 with some some merch ideas for shirts
64:29 that I personally would like to wear I
64:32 just want to explain it one time there's
64:37 a lot of great shirts that come out of a
64:39 lot of great truth movements but then
64:40 they co-brand it with their brand and
64:43 some of you may dig that I hate that
64:45 [ __ ] when for instance Disney came out
64:48 with a Tower of Terror which was based
64:50 on the Twilight Zone series I'm a huge
64:53 Twilight Zone fan I would love to have
64:54 just straight up Twilight Zone shirts
64:56 but the people who own the franchise
64:57 haven't made any trial at Twilight Zone
65:01 shirts that I would ever wear they're
65:03 all over branded goofy stupid pictures
65:06 they're not interesting least the ones
65:08 I've seen so I was so excited to go to
65:11 the Tower of Terror and see if I could
65:13 find myself a generic Twilight Zone
65:15 shirt but you can't its ride zone with
65:17 the ride on it Twilight Zone with Disney
65:20 on it and so just you know putting like
65:23 the envelope that says Rod Serling on
65:25 the front of the shirt I think that'd be
65:26 awesome
65:26 so I'm gonna create some shirts that
65:29 have deep thoughts brand on it if you
65:31 dig the show that much and you'd like to
65:32 create a conversation with someone going
65:35 what the hell is that those shirts will
65:37 be available but they'll be quarantined
65:38 into their own shirts I'm gonna make
65:41 other shirts at least right now I dig
65:43 shirts you know I wear t-shirts and
65:44 stuff on the show but I want other
65:47 shirts that just simply provoke thought
65:50 to simply say I think you know people
65:54 look at your shirt and go the hell's
65:56 that mean like what do you think it
65:57 means I think it's a new pastime it's
66:01 starting to catch on again 2018 I
66:03 suggest you look into it's really cool
66:05 you know stuff like that
66:07 it's anyway take care of yourself and
66:10 someone else and I'll see you in the
66:12 next late night deep thoughts over now
