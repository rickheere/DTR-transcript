00:14 so
00:19 [Music]
00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:35 gentlemen
00:37 it's 49 degrees out so i had to put the
00:40 cap on
00:42 so today i'm going to try to describe
00:44 something that i
00:46 picked up from one of the weirdest
00:47 locations
00:50 and it came from an interview
00:53 i've got so many hoodies on and get my
00:55 hair all
00:56 situated it came from an interview with
00:59 ian
01:00 mckellen as a very young actor
01:03 on the dick cavett show
01:06 it was a sort of a
01:10 crash and burn interview uh not that
01:13 anyone was disappointed with each other
01:14 but just watching dick
01:16 uh try to interview ian it was just
01:19 weird
01:19 sort of like the very bizarre d
01:22 cavitt interview with eddie murphy if
01:24 you want to see a public train wreck
01:26 i'm a huge fan of dick's show and the
01:29 way he interviews people pretty real
01:31 from back in the day
01:33 but he was asking ian a question about
01:38 whether or not he could act as if he
01:40 were a bad actor
01:43 and whether or not acting on stage is
01:46 more
01:47 difficult than acting in a movie i think
01:50 it was actually the other way around the
01:51 way the question was proposed and ian
01:54 being a very classically trained actor
01:58 ends up telling dick cavett
02:02 this phrase of fashions of reality
02:08 and he said you know if the audience
02:10 member
02:12 well he said basically an audience
02:14 member could watch ian perform
02:16 a play shakespearean play
02:19 it'll all look perfect from 20 feet away
02:24 but if that same audience member were to
02:26 come up on stage
02:28 and watch ian like really up close
02:32 then they would think it looked so
02:35 strange on stage
02:37 because there's a way obviously you turn
02:39 to face the audience you know you don't
02:40 block yourself that sort of thing
02:42 and it's sort of like what you'll see
02:44 sometimes uh on television but most of
02:46 the time it does happen on stage if two
02:48 people want to talk to each other
02:50 on a stage they do not face each other
02:54 usually the way that we face each other
02:56 in real life they rotate
02:59 to about a 30 degree with their face in
03:03 the audience with their torso
03:06 and then the other actors doing the same
03:08 thing so it's sort of a kind of a wide
03:10 v-shape
03:12 and they're talking and kind of looking
03:13 at each other but they know they have to
03:15 give their facial expression to the
03:16 audience
03:18 but what ian tapped into was like
03:20 straight up marshall mcluhan kind of
03:22 stuff
03:23 and i guess this is something that is
03:25 taught but i don't know if the actual
03:26 phrase
03:28 fashions of reality is something that is
03:31 taught by a
03:32 acting teacher i took acting and i don't
03:34 remember anyone mentioning this at all
03:36 but he says over time
03:39 things change and he gives an example of
03:43 a very famous actor in england which i
03:45 do not know and he quoted a play which i
03:46 don't remember what it was
03:49 but he said that when he was young he
03:52 watched this
03:53 mentor sort of actor
03:56 being very animated and speaking in a
04:00 particular way
04:02 and he says if i did that today on stage
04:05 i would
04:06 garner a laugh but back in the day of
04:09 his mentor
04:10 it was revered as a standing ovation
04:13 type performance
04:15 and so i was thinking about this and
04:17 thinking okay how do i get like
04:20 you know anyone to hear this and
04:23 understand it
04:24 regardless of your background with
04:26 acting or
04:28 or writing or filmmaking or anything
04:30 like that and i think a really easy one
04:32 is
04:33 you know when we look back at buster
04:35 keaton charlie chaplin
04:38 or is it fred allen we see
04:41 in silent movies this over exaggerated
04:44 everything
04:45 the makeup is over exaggerated so that
04:47 it reads in the camera
04:49 expressions are just 10x
04:52 but that's what makes those silent
04:53 movies brilliant
04:57 plus they're always running a little you
04:58 know a little fast unless they're
05:00 corrected
05:02 as cameras and microphones improved
05:06 this fashion of reality started to
05:08 emulate closer and closer to reality
05:11 now the one thing i don't have access to
05:14 and maybe some of you do and it would be
05:15 a great piece of
05:16 homework for you to come back into the
05:18 comments depending on how old you are
05:20 you may know this
05:22 but i was raised on old 30s movies as a
05:25 young young kid
05:26 james cagney humphrey bogart
05:30 and we know that they had a cadence to
05:31 the way that they spoke
05:33 one they spoke extremely fast and the
05:35 audience had no problem understanding
05:36 them
05:38 pretty much proving we've been dumbed
05:40 down but given
05:42 the participation trophy that makes us
05:45 try to makes us feel like we're smarter
05:47 but we're
05:48 we're only academically smarter about
05:50 technologies that didn't exist back in
05:51 those days but
05:53 socially i don't know
05:57 we definitely communicate better and
05:58 we're aware of various
06:01 elements of psychology and that sort of
06:02 thing
06:04 but today if you really want to make a
06:06 serious film
06:07 i think directors and writers are
06:10 capable of actually tracking
06:12 and creating a scene and filming it and
06:13 the actors are able to portray it
06:15 that really does feel as close to
06:17 reality as they want
06:20 as they want so regardless if this is a
06:24 phrase that's just out there to describe
06:26 exactly what i'm saying to you
06:29 i want us all from this point forward to
06:31 think about this little phrase
06:33 fashion of reality because
06:39 we are all trying to maintain the
06:40 highest level of integrity
06:43 for our spheres of influence
06:48 whether we consciously realize it or not
06:50 we actually have
06:53 this is going to be really interesting
06:55 if you think about yourself having a
06:57 true sphere of influence
06:59 now the only silly thing is is you don't
07:01 get to see the sphere underneath you
07:02 unless you're on a trampoline
07:04 but other than that our sphere of
07:07 influence
07:08 is very much like the human cell
07:12 the human cell has a membrane the
07:15 membrane is the brain of the cell
07:17 it decides what comes in and what goes
07:19 out now i can be tricked by a virus
07:22 it can be tricked by um
07:27 white blood cells carrying things in
07:30 but it's doing its best it's get three
07:33 layers of cells
07:35 the outside cell layer that says are you
07:38 friend or foe
07:40 then a transmission electrical layer in
07:42 between
07:44 and then a another layer
07:47 which is to let things out
07:51 for excretion and that sort of thing and
07:52 it when it it does do waste
07:55 collection our sphere of influence is
07:58 almost identical in a subconscious way
08:02 once you get red pill once you wake up
08:05 and it doesn't have to do with politics
08:07 once you're just awake to
08:11 trying to make sure that you're
08:13 evaluating the folks in your life
08:17 all the way from family members to
08:18 friends to random strangers
08:21 you want the highest level of integrity
08:24 in terms of a filter for those that
08:27 enter your life
08:29 have you ever wondered why it's really
08:31 tough to meet a celebrity
08:33 it's because at first they keep this
08:38 membrane open because they want to honor
08:41 their fans
08:43 and then too many crazies come through
08:45 the door
08:47 and so they start putting up the
08:48 barriers keep everyone away from me if
08:50 they get a really bad one
08:52 everybody loses i just finished a um
08:56 a documentary on adam ant
08:59 i was a huge fan of adamant i didn't
09:01 realize i had found him
09:02 pretty much within the 12 months that he
09:04 launched kings of the wild frontier
09:06 really got his look down for me you know
09:09 he'd always been that way but he
09:10 actually
09:11 hadn't he'd only just recently figured
09:14 out how to polish that off after about
09:16 three years of prep
09:17 but this dude goes through his whole
09:19 career gets to a point where stress is
09:22 just
09:23 bugging him out he's a little bit of a
09:25 manic depressant
09:27 and so he comes to los angeles to get
09:29 into the film business and he gets quite
09:31 a few roles
09:33 and while living here
09:36 this woman starts stalking him
09:41 and she comes over to his house and says
09:44 you know
09:45 he's dating this other girl who's really
09:48 really sweet and has
09:50 saved him you know from mental
09:52 breakdowns and stuff so he's in this
09:53 great situation
09:56 and this he answers the door or
09:58 something and she says uh
10:00 i want you to get the [ __ ] out of the
10:02 house and
10:04 i am the one that you're in love with
10:06 i'm the only one that you're
10:08 in love with and just living in her own
10:10 world boy i know a couple of those
10:13 but she stalked him for three years
10:17 turns out turns out that
10:21 not only did she get put in jail for
10:23 that stocking because i think she
10:24 entered his house
10:26 and put a cake in his house with some
10:28 writing out or something
10:30 but california passed anti-stalking laws
10:32 as a result of this woman
10:34 chasing out a man so he packs up his
10:37 stuff
10:38 goes back to england i think his
10:41 relationship here fell apart
10:43 he gets married for a little while in
10:45 england and sure enough
10:46 he's in his flat in england and the
10:49 doorbell just won't stop ringing and he
10:51 opens the door
10:52 and it's some crazy chick and she sticks
10:54 her foot in the
10:56 in the door but she claims
11:00 that he put a microchip in her brain
11:02 because he's a neurosurgeon
11:03 right and then he's been broadcasting
11:06 messages come get me
11:07 i so wanna make love to you and all this
11:10 other stuff so
11:11 not only did he get two stalkers but he
11:13 got two
11:14 absolutely certifiable crazy stalkers
11:18 for a few years of my life i was chasing
11:20 away these people for a friend of mine
11:22 who was very famous
11:25 they're out there it's crazy where are
11:27 you good ladies out there come on
11:30 you geniuses are nice and adjusted
11:35 but what's this have to do with the
11:37 fashions of reality and what the hell am
11:39 i talking about in the first place
11:42 it goes like this it goes back to ian
11:43 mckellen's statement
11:47 how many of you watch television today
11:51 because not because you want to but
11:52 because you're sitting at some
11:53 restaurant you're sitting at a bar
11:55 for whatever reason you're stuck
11:57 someplace you're at a friend's house
12:00 and they just love them commercials man
12:03 and you just cannot believe
12:08 that anyone
12:11 digests or accepts the [ __ ] coming out
12:13 of this television
12:15 as reality it feels like
12:18 your brain is melting away
12:22 you turn on the news and you can't
12:23 believe that anyone thinks this is
12:25 actually a regimented
12:30 journalistically sound
12:34 artery to get information about how the
12:36 world works
12:39 you're just sitting there going this is
12:40 like the crazy you turn on th
12:42 here's the only thing worse than
12:44 television is a radio
12:47 radios today i mean i don't know why
12:50 they put them in cars anymore other than
12:52 you want to hear
12:53 something on your telephone but in terms
12:55 of fm and am
12:57 if i ever okay let's just get done
12:59 paying for my car
13:00 i'm gonna try to pull the rom on this
13:02 thing and just
13:04 erase fm and am
13:08 source code out of this thing i never
13:11 ever ever want to hear those two
13:13 bandwidths
13:14 in my life uh in california
13:18 nothing's in english anyway it's swill
13:21 times swill time swell
13:26 so that is an example of fashions of
13:29 reality
13:31 go back and watch all television shows
13:33 and i mean any one of them
13:35 and they feel odd the more decades that
13:38 you go back but you don't have to go
13:39 back to leave it to beaver
13:40 just go back to the 90s watch an old
13:42 episode of martin
13:44 fresh prince of bel-air now some of
13:47 these fashions are very entertaining
13:50 but all of you know that there's
13:54 a difference between the entertainment
13:56 channels where you're kind of going ah
13:57 this is a quirky weird-ass show
14:00 it's all fiction it's all for my
14:02 entertainment
14:03 and then you'll click over to something
14:06 that's trying to be informative
14:09 and i think that i'm gonna struggle a
14:11 little bit to describe this
14:14 and we might you might end up just
14:16 getting me right away i'm sure you guys
14:17 do
14:18 especially your og listeners but you're
14:21 gonna probably
14:22 think about like oh god yeah there's
14:23 that thing you know how do you describe
14:25 that
14:26 how do you describe these faux realities
14:29 that they're trying to project at us
14:32 and we call it like you know in the
14:34 category of journalism
14:36 or what i think david ike beautifully
14:39 calls
14:40 repeaters not reporters it's all
14:43 propaganda
14:44 it's all agenda-based and so we have a
14:46 nice name
14:47 for the news
14:51 fake news right we say that
14:54 and that's a large part of what's on
14:56 television
14:58 but what about everything else
15:01 these shows that um you know
15:05 for years and years we've been operating
15:08 watching television as an
15:10 a suspension of disbelief it's sort of
15:11 what we like
15:13 and it's a little bit easier when it's
15:14 on point like a star track
15:16 that's on point there's a federation
15:19 it's 2400
15:20 ad from 23 to 24.
15:24 and so we feel very comfortable that the
15:27 mind is not being brainwashed in any way
15:29 shape or form
15:30 and this isn't going to be about
15:31 brainwashing necessarily
15:34 but we know where we are when we go into
15:36 the kitchen to get a sandwich to bring
15:38 it back out to
15:38 finish up the star trek episode we're
15:41 still very centered
15:44 it's when the line between the world
15:46 that you're living in
15:47 and the stuff you're watching on tv is a
15:50 very thin line
15:52 for me that's where you can get in
15:55 trouble
15:56 we have this built-in thing
16:00 you all know it it's called monkey see
16:03 monkey do
16:06 and it really stems from the fact that
16:08 when we were babies
16:09 what other choice did we have it was a
16:13 survival mechanism and depending on how
16:15 good your family is and your
16:16 surroundings
16:17 it could have been the difference
16:18 between you being a prodigy child
16:21 and you're just being a normal kid or
16:24 struggling with
16:25 learning disabilities for a little while
16:27 until you figured it out and got past it
16:29 you know
16:31 so your environment's very powerful but
16:34 anything that ever worked out for you
16:35 where you were an emulator
16:37 of your surroundings don't forget that
16:40 that's a talent that you have
16:42 in fact don't forget that when you were
16:43 born you didn't go to college
16:46 to figure out how to emulate so that you
16:47 could come back in the daycare
16:49 or sit in your crib with your parents
16:51 looking down on you and you got it right
16:53 you just got it right because your genes
16:55 do that
16:56 it's probably one of the most innate
16:58 talents of the human species
17:02 now remember this
17:05 you never lost that talent as a matter
17:09 of fact
17:09 i'm willing to bet everything that i own
17:12 that you only got better at it
17:16 why because you went to school
17:20 you got a job you were at a party once
17:23 you wanted to attract the opposite sex
17:26 or
17:26 sorry i don't mean to exclude anybody if
17:28 you wanted to track whatever you're
17:30 attracted to right
17:32 and so you emulate you try to watch a
17:35 movie you pick up a line that a girl
17:36 might listen to you know
17:39 by the way funny as it might be taxi
17:42 there's the the tall guy who's trying to
17:45 be the actor
17:46 he was in grease lightning or he was in
17:47 greece excuse me but he was in the
17:49 grease lightning segment in greece
17:51 this dude has a lot of great one-liners
17:53 it's a joke that he has great one-liners
17:55 and they they really are pretty i don't
17:56 use one-liners myself
17:57 but if you need a few that show's got
17:59 some doozies
18:02 you could update them for the 21st
18:04 century but still theories are pretty
18:05 good
18:07 and you may emulate in two different
18:09 ways
18:11 i'm sure we all do this every day one
18:15 you might emulate with the intent to
18:18 build it into your character
18:19 because it is something that you really
18:21 admire
18:23 and usually it is a less is more formula
18:25 you know i've told you guys a million
18:27 times
18:27 you know when i was 15 years old pretty
18:30 much
18:31 i made a decision to be a soft-spoken
18:33 person
18:35 i made that decision that doesn't mean i
18:39 i always speak softly i don't know if
18:42 i'm at a
18:43 karaoke bar and i'm trying to make
18:44 everybody laugh i'm going to get nuts
18:46 with it but
18:47 you know on the mic you know but
18:50 otherwise just in
18:51 normal conversation that's just
18:52 something i saw my dad's best friend do
18:55 he was a genius
18:56 at it and so i was into it
18:59 so that's one i liked i took a lot of
19:01 practice
19:03 fighting my instincts and i built it
19:05 into my character as much as i possibly
19:07 can i
19:08 attempt to refine it every day of my
19:09 life to whisper when you want to scream
19:12 as prince said
19:14 graffiti bridge but then there's the
19:17 other one we do
19:19 which is to get by if you've ever gotten
19:22 a job
19:24 at like a fantasy location it doesn't
19:27 matter how big or small that job is it
19:29 is just a job
19:30 you always want you could be a young kid
19:33 14 years old 15 years old whenever
19:34 you're allowed to work in your state
19:36 and man you go in and you don't want to
19:38 mess up
19:40 and so in order not to mess up if you're
19:42 smart
19:43 and it's a very natural thing you just
19:45 start looking around
19:47 you start when you come in quiet that's
19:49 usually the the best way to
19:51 survive is to come in quiet and ratchet
19:53 up slowly over time
19:56 but watching how boisterous is this
19:58 group of people that i'm working with
20:00 are they very quiet
20:01 people does anyone listen to music on a
20:04 headset
20:05 you know when problems arise in the
20:08 business
20:09 whether it be a problem that everyone's
20:11 dealing with as in the economy or
20:13 something
20:15 how do they bring it to a table and
20:16 discuss it
20:18 and as you start to you know massage
20:20 your personality and figure out where
20:22 your skill sets are
20:23 you may go marching a lot heavier on the
20:25 next opportunity
20:27 but i almost think it's good advice no
20:29 matter how old you are
20:31 to uh to be cool for a while
20:35 work as hard as you possibly can for
20:37 those first 90 days for sure man
20:38 make a mark the reason why i mention
20:41 that is i want to remind you
20:43 how often we do this because
20:47 we have pockets
20:50 where there are multiple fashions of
20:53 reality
20:54 you turn on the radio there's a fashion
20:56 of reality that you expect
20:57 a radio to address you by real
21:00 jingly sort of ads man you listen to two
21:03 minutes of content and 10 minutes of ads
21:06 and
21:07 and they'll try to say you know i try to
21:09 guilt trip you in to listen to all the
21:10 ads well we got to pay the bills so
21:11 we'll be back in 10 minutes and
21:14 a non-commercial hour free of music you
21:17 know it's like
21:18 dude just turn it off and dj your own
21:20 stuff would you
21:22 put these places out of business man
21:25 that's why sirius came around nobody
21:28 want to listen to this crap just pay the
21:29 bill
21:30 listen to your favorite dj talk your
21:32 favorite station just go
21:34 without any commercials unless they're
21:36 selling you something directly inside
21:38 the offering that you already love but
21:41 you turn
21:42 on official news like big network news
21:45 and that has a particular
21:46 fashion of reality that you're to
21:48 conform to their fashion of reality
21:51 and let me give you might be like what
21:52 the hell are you talking about you know
21:54 i'll give an example broadcast speak
21:58 i used to criticize it on the show a lot
21:59 and i still hate it
22:02 the reason why i don't talk about it
22:04 much is i don't see any of that news
22:05 anymore
22:06 i haven't ingested any official news in
22:09 so long
22:10 in terms of like a video of official
22:12 news
22:14 i won't even watch a conspiracy video
22:16 trying to red pill me if all they're
22:18 gonna do is play me clips
22:20 of propaganda to try and rag on them
22:23 i don't want to hear it i don't want you
22:25 to tweet it
22:27 you know your broadcast speak talks like
22:30 this
22:31 they're talking to you remember wolf
22:34 blitzer
22:36 the guy talks like no one talks on
22:38 planet earth
22:39 he's an industrial fan
22:42 of propaganda he could do a what is it a
22:45 maxell commercial
22:47 or the dude sitting in the leather chair
22:49 listening to the stereo and his hair is
22:50 blowing back like mine
22:52 and it's just wolf blitzer not a
22:54 television
22:56 why on earth would anyone on planet
22:58 earth listen to people who talk to you
23:02 sort of in a belittling you're so stupid
23:04 i'm i'm talking in this particular way
23:08 it's insulting every single
23:12 channel on on social media youtube
23:15 rumble all these places bid shoot
23:19 where these individuals have 150 to 200
23:21 000 followers
23:23 they're just talking to you like normal
23:25 and we're sick and tired
23:27 of this artificial human
23:31 bizarre probably suggestive
23:38 tones that everyone's talking in it may
23:41 be some hypnotic thing
23:43 to talk to you like this you know and
23:45 let the healing
23:46 begin and just the
23:49 you know if you ever watch old 80s and
23:51 probably even 90s news
23:53 you've got the the puns
23:58 these mouth breathing repeaters
24:02 trying to litter
24:06 something with tons of puns to sort of
24:07 make it kind of funny
24:10 go take a nap would you now the only
24:13 place where some of this makes sense to
24:14 me
24:16 are shows that are designed for children
24:19 i understand why they do it
24:22 i have a policy myself
24:26 that once a child hits about nine years
24:28 old
24:30 the baby talk needs to end mommy needs
24:33 to stop talking like that to daddy and
24:35 all this other stuff
24:36 unless it's uh something else you like
24:38 to do
24:39 but i like to talk to kids like they
24:41 have brains
24:42 about nine years old there's some wild
24:45 little button inside their brain
24:49 the kids that typically are more
24:50 independent in life
24:52 higher iqs had parents
24:55 that treated them like adults after this
24:58 certain age at least by 10.
25:00 now little little kids yeah man they're
25:03 living in a cartoon
25:04 they watch cartoons on tv all their toys
25:07 are really
25:08 anthropomorphized toys look at all the
25:12 disney
25:13 animated movies from back in the day
25:15 beautiful
25:17 animations of talking candlesticks and
25:19 that kind of stuff
25:20 so we want to let them kind of enjoy
25:22 that world they shouldn't have to
25:25 i don't believe the statement they
25:26 shouldn't have to grow up too too
25:28 quickly
25:29 but i think that they shouldn't have
25:31 magic extinguished
25:34 because we should be protecting them in
25:35 a little envelope
25:37 but about nine or ten because they're
25:39 about to go into their teens and you
25:41 know what the teens are all about
25:42 the teens are all about try everything
25:44 you might end up doing
25:46 for a living and even if what you end up
25:49 doing for a living is none of those
25:51 things at least you
25:52 have that in your background and you
25:55 maybe you unequivocally know that is not
25:57 what i want to do
25:58 i went to college and found philosophy
26:01 something i couldn't get when i was a
26:02 teenager sort of thing
26:05 and as i struggled to put this into
26:06 words i'm gonna probably put together
26:09 some pretty
26:10 bizarre analogies to sort of give us a
26:13 vocabulary and a mechanism to talk about
26:15 this
26:18 but how many of you have seen a book
26:21 where either there's two books i know
26:23 that do this one is sort of a grey's
26:25 anatomy book where you've got
26:28 clear overlays at some point in the book
26:29 there's a cool section where
26:32 the first overlay that goes down are
26:35 the bones second overlay are
26:39 the blue arteries then the red arteries
26:41 then some organs come in right
26:43 and you just keep overlaying until you
26:44 build the human being and you put the
26:46 muscle tissue on and then the epidermis
26:48 and some clothes
26:49 and you got a human being my favorite
26:51 one when i was a kid was the old king
26:53 tut book
26:54 where you could you could essentially
26:56 dig him out of the
26:57 tomb he was in take off the face mask
27:00 and all this other stuff he all the way
27:02 down to his body
27:03 all mummified i want you to think of
27:06 your reality as one of these sort of
27:10 layer imaging imaging systems
27:14 now when you wake up in the morning
27:17 and let's say you have a moment to
27:18 yourself
27:20 you're in the bathroom bathroom is one
27:23 of the most
27:24 self moments that you have in your life
27:28 no matter if you're married with 10 kids
27:30 you're in that bathroom you had a moment
27:33 to look in the mirror
27:35 did you age today do you need to shave
27:37 today
27:38 you can pluck your eyebrows ladies
27:40 whatever it is and get in the shower
27:43 and most of the time i think even if you
27:44 have a lover you're in the shower
27:47 solo and so it's your little ritual it's
27:49 your thing you can do whatever you want
27:51 you can wash your hair first wash your
27:53 body first whatever you're doing
27:55 but the second you start putting your
27:56 clothes on you're starting to make
27:58 choices about how you're going to
28:00 portray yourself to the outside world
28:03 i know people that won't go outside
28:05 unless they look fantastic
28:07 no matter what dudes chicks don't matter
28:11 but i also know people that just kind of
28:13 cover the bases every day and go outside
28:16 i'm not naked enough to get a ticket am
28:18 i okay i'm good you know
28:20 and to each their own i'm not
28:22 criticizing anybody but
28:24 i'm saying this to illustrate the fact
28:26 that some people have
28:28 more dedication to a persona
28:32 and other folks are living in their
28:34 character the difference being
28:36 characters who you really are and
28:37 persona is what you
28:39 portray to the outside world me wearing
28:41 sunglasses at night
28:43 and this show is a persona move me
28:46 wearing everything else out here
28:47 that's my character now the other
28:50 interesting perspective on this
28:53 is kind of what i alluded to earlier
28:54 which is
28:56 the history of man's
28:59 reality fashions to flip the words
29:01 around
29:03 i like many of you definitely fantasize
29:06 at night as i'm going to bed
29:08 about time traveling to various times
29:11 and not traveling way far away from my
29:15 comfort zone or my actual experience in
29:18 this life but going back to say like my
29:20 little hometown in kansas
29:22 and say i think they finally chose the
29:24 name in like somewhere in 1850 1860
29:27 somewhere in there
29:28 but as soon as they locked down the name
29:30 of the city
29:32 town it's a township man
29:35 how amazing would it be to do the old
29:37 christopher reeve somewhere in time
29:39 thing where i kind of put some garb on
29:41 it's looks like their time frame get rid
29:44 of all the coins in my pockets from 1976
29:46 or whatever it was
29:49 and then go back
29:52 and just be a fly on the wall go into
29:55 the businesses
29:57 talk to the people who own these places
29:59 go i mean there was no
30:01 cars back in the day so then get to see
30:03 a horse and
30:04 carriage go by find out that people
30:07 don't travel that much because
30:09 you just don't you can't it's not that
30:11 easy there's a train coming through town
30:13 i might take a train
30:14 to humboldt or iola try to take the eat
30:17 lunch and eat dinner and come on back on
30:19 the
30:19 late night train something my parents
30:22 used to do my grandparents
30:24 and i assure you that probably at least
30:28 every 20 to 30 years if you were to jump
30:31 in those increments
30:32 up say you start in 1850
30:36 you're going to see a whole other
30:37 fashion of reality
30:39 how people talk what they talk about
30:43 how many times have you heard these sort
30:45 of historical recaps
30:48 for various reasons could be a war
30:50 historic
30:52 uh documentary could just be someone
30:53 talking about the 40s or whatever
30:56 and you'll hear people say you know we
30:58 didn't talk about those things back then
31:01 recently here in the last six months one
31:03 thing that's really surfaced
31:05 has been religion and politics
31:08 were two things that you weren't to talk
31:10 about
31:11 and i think it was a documentary i just
31:14 saw i mean probably some little short
31:15 video but
31:16 someone's talking about in great britain
31:18 they were saying look man
31:20 you were considered a complete [ __ ]
31:22 if you brought those two subjects up
31:24 in any way shape or form because it was
31:27 you were never to ask another person who
31:30 they voted for
31:32 and as far as religion goes well they
31:34 knew it just led to bad conversation
31:38 that is a delineation between now
31:41 and then because i'm pretty sure britain
31:45 can't
31:45 you can't walk around anywhere unless
31:47 they figured out whether you're a brexit
31:49 person or a boris person or a queen
31:51 person or whatever
31:52 because everyone's trying to extort out
31:55 of you
31:56 your choices to then come back and
31:58 punish you
31:59 i think what appeals to me most about
32:02 this entire theory because it was just
32:03 said in the realm of acting
32:06 is it is acting and here we are
32:10 in an era where we are now waking up
32:12 faster than we can
32:14 almost consciously mature to the data
32:16 that we're getting right we're getting
32:17 all kinds of data that
32:19 we really don't know how to process i
32:22 mean how many people
32:23 have heard all these rumors about and
32:26 even the proof
32:26 and evidence of human trafficking and
32:29 child trafficking in epstein's island
32:34 yes you mechanically know in your mind
32:36 what they are talking about
32:38 but no one wants to cross that line and
32:41 you shouldn't have to
32:42 man or woman hard soldier or
32:46 some [ __ ] beta male or whatever you
32:48 shouldn't have to ever
32:50 see in your mind what these people did
32:52 to be able to convict them in a court of
32:54 law
32:57 it just goes right up to the edge of
32:58 hell and you stop there and you go okay
33:01 no children should even see this line
33:04 let alone be living on the other side
33:07 because some
33:09 you know adam schiff wants to or joe
33:11 biden wants to do something to him
33:14 but now what have we seen in the last
33:16 year
33:18 we've seen ted talks trying to make this
33:20 okay
33:22 we have shows on netflix that are trying
33:24 to make it okay
33:26 they're not the first guilty people on
33:28 the planet to try to make this okay
33:30 it's just the most recent attempts it's
33:33 one thing to have sympathy
33:35 for someone struggling i guess with this
33:38 attraction slash addiction
33:41 it's a whole other thing when you're
33:42 informed that they have been engaging in
33:44 such a thing
33:45 even pictorially we as
33:49 citizens of the world who want to make
33:52 this a better place
33:54 we have to understand i think these
33:57 fashions of reality
33:58 to either reject them or accept them
34:03 in our sphere of our influence
34:07 because the sphere of influence it goes
34:10 both ways man
34:12 your sphere of influence is someone
34:14 steps in your sphere this is how it's
34:16 classically defined
34:17 you're influencing everyone in that
34:18 sphere depending on your personality
34:20 type
34:22 however if you let a bad apple through
34:24 that door
34:25 they're going to start influencing you
34:28 one of the uh
34:30 common scams that's going on on
34:32 instagram
34:34 and if you're a dude i can't see how you
34:37 haven't had this happen to you and it
34:39 doesn't matter if you don't like chicks
34:41 you get these i'm just going to call
34:44 them horse
34:46 they come up to your page they invite
34:48 you into some chat
34:51 and they try to have i just try to crack
34:53 one the other day i did i cracked this
34:55 this you know god knows where they're
34:57 from they could be in any country
34:59 in the world it could be in america but
35:02 they
35:03 build a profile out of someone else's
35:05 pictures they don't know you
35:06 from the hell of beans and they come in
35:10 now they do it a couple different ways
35:12 sometimes they approach you and it's all
35:14 robot
35:15 on the other side it's just software but
35:17 they'll approach you
35:19 hi you know and they're trying to find a
35:21 desperate guy
35:23 to jump into this reality oh man i got
35:26 me a
35:26 hot chick last one i had i was at the
35:29 lounge watching it one night
35:31 and my buddies around me and we just
35:33 started playing this chick on the phone
35:34 i mean who even knows if it's a woman
35:38 and it was a bunch of pictures and i
35:39 didn't recognize the person at all
35:42 i mean it wasn't famous and it wasn't
35:43 anyone i knew
35:45 hey you know so immediately i grabbed
35:48 the pictures down
35:49 look it up this person is used to famous
35:52 porn stars
35:54 pictures an older middle-aged woman but
35:56 she was definitely
35:57 smoking it wasn't her of course
36:02 and i'll give you the little trick i
36:03 always do with these folks
36:05 just to see what they do you know
36:07 they're fake the second they touch you
36:09 sometimes they do the other one is just
36:11 throw it out because this is a really
36:12 easy one they bring in three people and
36:13 try to do that all together
36:14 would you like to see me get undressed
36:16 and then they give you some link
36:19 or they try to get you into some app
36:22 they're trying to steal your credit
36:23 cards they're trying to get you to send
36:25 the money
36:26 gift certificates and gift cards and
36:28 also the crap but what i do is i always
36:30 say
36:31 oh that's pretty pretty neat little you
36:34 know pictures you got there you look
36:35 like you're really pretty
36:37 oh yeah i'm telling praying don't good
36:40 and then i'll say uh
36:41 why don't you do me a favor since you're
36:44 chatting with me through your telephone
36:45 because
36:45 actually i'll i'll bait him into
36:47 answering that question you just are you
36:49 talking to me through your phone oh yeah
36:51 yeah yeah
36:52 okay everyone's got a telephone with a
36:55 camera
36:56 i said i'll say take a picture of
36:58 yourself holding up
36:59 three fingers now this last one was
37:03 pretty clever
37:05 pretty yeah about five minutes they kind
37:07 of disappear because they have ten
37:08 thousand conversations with other people
37:10 it could all be robots as far as i know
37:11 but this one actually i think had a
37:12 person on this side
37:16 pretty quickly about five minutes later
37:17 i get a picture with two fingers up
37:20 but now everybody does the peace sign
37:23 this person
37:24 found that scene i found the site they
37:25 were dragging all the uh
37:27 photos off and i'm looking right at the
37:28 peace sign one so sure i get the peace
37:30 sign one back it's only two fingers not
37:31 three
37:34 and so then i said uh you know that's
37:37 just two that's not three why are you
37:40 asking so many dumb questions
37:42 that's the response i get every single
37:44 time they tell these [ __ ] to say this
37:46 stuff
37:46 why you ask so many dumb questions
37:52 so funny man what these people i think
37:56 are trying to do
37:57 is to create this little annex
38:01 of reality right you let's say i was
38:04 married with kids
38:06 and you know i'm a preacher or something
38:09 and that's my world i got my homeworld
38:11 with my home rules for the family and i
38:13 got the
38:14 ministry it's got its own rules god
38:17 decides those
38:18 out in public i gotta behave a certain
38:20 way i got a third one
38:22 i talk to old people different and i
38:24 talk to little kids
38:27 and here's this person offering a person
38:29 on the other side
38:30 this little quarantined naughty area
38:35 i would love to know the metrics on the
38:36 success of these people
38:38 playing people it's all fake
38:42 all fake and what's weird is you'll
38:46 report them sometimes to these
38:49 to instagram or whatever facebook has a
38:51 ton of them in facebook's like 50
38:54 fake at least and the community monitors
38:57 will be like they're not violating any
38:59 of our
38:59 things and it's like hey look at the
39:01 chat i just had with these this person
39:04 they're faking who they are this for me
39:07 is a bit like the glasses in the movie
39:08 they live
39:10 you put them on and you can start seeing
39:13 these layers
39:15 of fashion within reality
39:19 and i think that most of them make us
39:21 want to puke
39:22 the amount of people in the last five
39:24 years especially last two years
39:26 especially females i'm so impressed with
39:28 the females in this world right now
39:30 and i recently heard um i think it was
39:33 simon parks say
39:35 that the females are
39:38 really leading the charge in a way that
39:40 hasn't been led before in the red pill
39:42 community
39:44 because guys again like i've said
39:46 several times we're expected to follow
39:47 the conspiracies because we're just like
39:49 we're a little explorers whereas women
39:52 are like don't bother me
39:54 unless it's important or it's real that
39:57 women
39:58 are susceptible to different things and
40:00 men are susceptible to different things
40:01 like i just gave you an example
40:04 but the amount of females lately that
40:05 have told me how does anyone watch
40:07 tv just tv anything the news
40:11 uh friends you know something that's
40:14 other i don't mean
40:15 in soul friends if you love friends but
40:17 i mean look at friends it's
40:18 it's it's kind of fun and kitschy
40:21 but we know it's entertainment uh
40:24 there's characters in there that are so
40:26 extreme in one direction that you know
40:29 it's not reality
40:30 just like cheers just like taxi it's
40:33 when it's
40:34 tr it's trying to live in the mezzanine
40:36 between like sitting on the fence
40:38 between
40:39 crazy and reality
40:42 that you can start almost dragging your
40:45 own reality into their reality
40:48 and doing weird stuff in your own
40:50 circles of influence
40:52 that you if you were paying attention
40:56 to the small evolution from normality
41:00 to weirdness you wouldn't do it
41:04 you go why am i doing that that's weird
41:07 i started to accept
41:09 a faux reality within my own life
41:12 simply because i get good at what i do
41:15 and i've been doing this show for way
41:18 too long
41:20 now this show is helping me explain
41:23 something that i've
41:24 been thinking about for quite a while
41:27 and i don't mean to offend anyone who
41:29 appreciates this i just gave a big shout
41:33 out to
41:34 andre the giant not too far back
41:38 but let's take
41:41 professional wrestling and find quotes
41:44 now most adults know that this stuff is
41:46 not real
41:48 one guy got his with his ears clapped
41:51 and he sued the living crap out of the
41:52 guy because he had
41:54 hearing damage for the rest of his life
41:55 because he went up to somebody
41:57 i can't remember which wrestler it was
41:59 but he goes you know this is all fake
42:00 right and he just went
42:01 pop and popped his ears with two hands
42:03 at the same time and these are gigantic
42:05 human beings right
42:07 but i've as a kid i used to watch the
42:10 old school
42:12 almost spanish wrestler stuff like jack
42:14 black did
42:15 they would it would air in kansas city i
42:18 think on a sunday
42:20 and you know you're bored in the morning
42:21 you're just watching this stuff these
42:22 old men throwing each other around
42:25 but as i grew up i thought wrestling
42:29 there's a danger in that thing way
42:31 beyond kids trying to jackass themselves
42:34 to death you know i mean there's so many
42:36 kids that have broken their backs
42:38 and been paralyzed because they see
42:41 things on tv
42:42 and they do them in their hillbilly
42:44 houses one of the most famous ones the
42:46 kid
42:48 needed to stay in school he needed to
42:50 take some physics
42:51 he put a lawn chair one of those plastic
42:53 injection molded lawn chairs
42:56 down on the ground and he jumped off the
42:58 roof
42:59 and put his ass right in the seat and of
43:02 course that chair broken
43:03 instantaneously and his spine
43:07 hit the ground and you
43:10 they put it in these compilation videos
43:12 like it's so funny but i'm pretty sure
43:13 that
43:14 if that kid could feel his feet i would
43:16 be surprised but i
43:17 know that kid was in the hospital for a
43:19 very long time another one
43:21 same situation i can't remember how the
43:23 k how high the kid jumped from but
43:25 one of the legs went inside of his body
43:28 man
43:30 so there's that danger too but the
43:34 biggest danger is a very simple theme
43:37 adults and children
43:41 lying to themselves that this stuff is
43:42 real
43:44 for decades
43:47 you're looking at something that's fake
43:49 and telling yourself it's real
43:51 now some families know it's fake and
43:54 they have a good time and they're well
43:55 adjusted when they go home
43:57 and you just enjoy the the drama and the
43:59 story and you know it's like a sitcom
44:01 it is right so yeah you know a very
44:04 physical sitcom
44:06 and for those folks they're probably all
44:08 right but i come from the midwest where
44:10 i know there are dozens of families that
44:12 believe
44:13 all of this is real and they tell you
44:16 know they
44:16 hate somebody or they love somebody
44:19 based on a fictional thing
44:23 what do i keep telling you about the
44:25 more you do something that you're really
44:27 good at it
44:29 remember the russian kgb guy that said
44:32 by 1985
44:35 they could show an american the truth
44:37 and they would deny it
44:41 there's a fashion of reality for you i
44:44 hate to even say what i'm about to say
44:46 i think i even said it once some of my
44:47 old episodes i pulled
44:49 but this thing that happened in 2020 is
44:51 still going on
44:53 probably if there's a silver lining to
44:56 this situation
44:59 which i would never use this methodology
45:01 to do this again
45:04 but one of the silver linings is
45:05 humanity detoxing out of a lot of crap
45:08 because it can't be done right now and i
45:12 think that these professional wrestling
45:13 matches
45:15 kind of taken a year off letting people
45:19 pick up a book and read something or
45:21 find some other
45:22 form of entertainment maybe even listen
45:24 to their own thoughts and their mind
45:27 hmm it's probably been good for humanity
45:30 to be honest life used to be much more
45:33 simple
45:36 and it's simply because
45:39 entertainment barely existed
45:43 look back in history books man people
45:46 live really hard lives
45:48 it was just tough to survive and
45:51 entertainment might have been
45:53 a greek theater it might have been
45:57 someone in the neighborhood who can
45:58 sing a song or you might dance a couple
46:00 times a year because some celebrations
46:02 are going on
46:03 but for the most part people just live
46:05 lives i mean have any of you
46:08 heard the stories about how the romans
46:11 had the christians you know eaten alive
46:13 in these coliseums and you hear the
46:17 story that
46:18 they came to watch this
46:21 there's a fashion of reality for you
46:23 they came to watch it and you hear that
46:25 story as a little kid
46:26 first almost every single time you hear
46:28 that and
46:30 you know you know that the
46:32 subconsciously you know that the agenda
46:34 is
46:35 this isn't a story about anyone in the
46:37 audience this is a story about
46:40 christians being persecuted by the
46:43 caesars of the time
46:46 so push that aside because that's
46:48 something you've heard and you
46:49 understand
46:50 now crawl behind well just
46:54 time travel back there in your brain and
46:55 sit next to people in the coliseum and
46:58 just be like
46:58 what are we doing here well they're
47:00 going to kill these guys and they're
47:01 going to get ripped apart by a
47:03 by a lion and we're going to watch it
47:06 and we're going to yell and scream we're
47:08 going to eat our popcorn while this is
47:10 going on
47:11 nothing weird about seeing a body
47:13 disemboweled
47:14 but nothing weird about hearing screams
47:16 of human beings
47:18 i think that's a great example of how
47:20 versatile
47:22 the human consciousness can be
47:26 we now live in an absolute oxymoron
47:30 platform of humanity
47:33 one group can burn down a city and
47:35 they're heroes
47:38 they have no demands they have no iqs
47:41 they're littered with foreign agitators
47:43 they give all their money to a political
47:44 party that
47:45 doesn't give a [ __ ] about them and your
47:48 law-abiding citizens
47:50 well if they even stand next to a harsh
47:52 word
47:54 oh man they they're to be jailed and
47:56 have their lives destroyed
47:59 and somehow society isn't cleaning up
48:01 that other group
48:03 and unfortunately the cops are
48:05 participating in this
48:07 the military's allowing this the
48:10 fashions are always changing
48:13 but instead of being an organic
48:14 evolution of fashion
48:16 of reality it is now an orchestrated
48:19 designed
48:21 transition that is being projected at
48:23 you
48:24 through every medium you ingest
48:28 from youtube videos to television radio
48:32 every single form of media a newspaper
48:37 and then it infects all of the mouth
48:39 breathers of the world all the low
48:40 vibration low iq people
48:43 and you have to listen to at a
48:44 restaurant right
48:46 i had some barbecue today and uh
48:49 it's a great meal and there's two
48:52 couples two old couples probably about
48:53 the age of my parents
48:57 and then they're masks on it's good i
48:59 guess they should they're sort of in
49:00 that risk
49:01 thing i guess you know i mean i don't
49:04 know if they did that when the flu was
49:06 going around but whatever
49:08 and they're just organizing their
49:11 medical regimens they've accepted it in
49:15 terms of getting something in their arm
49:18 they surrendered
49:21 their medical prowess to other people
49:24 who they don't know
49:26 i mean you know most neighborhoods have
49:28 some geniuses on the block
49:30 especially in a small town where you
49:31 know everyone big city and you don't
49:33 know someone two
49:34 two doors down let's say you're in a
49:38 little tiny town
49:39 and you know everybody you know dudes
49:41 the professor
49:43 at the college that teaches virology
49:44 that one's a doctor at the hospital and
49:47 so and so there's a scientist there and
49:48 there and these three people come
49:50 together and they think that they've
49:51 created
49:52 uh a serum that once put in your body
49:56 will make your iq higher
49:58 and they come and knock on your door and
50:00 say we need to put this in your arm
50:02 why because you're going to love it it's
50:04 going to make your brain even more
50:05 powerful than it is
50:07 are you going to let him do it they said
50:10 oh no we did 10 years of clinical
50:12 studies we've been doing it on each
50:13 other
50:15 now you're not going to do it but today
50:19 you don't even have that intimate
50:21 connection with the people
50:23 that created this thing or the people
50:25 that want to put it in your body
50:26 you can't even find out what's in the
50:28 thing
50:30 fashion of reality give up
50:34 that's one of the fashions surrender
50:37 trust i mean do you guys know of a
50:40 corporation that is just making the
50:42 world a better place
50:43 that's all they do they just make the
50:46 world of better i'm not talking about
50:47 getting your uh
50:49 your back massager in the mail overnight
50:51 ladies i'm talking about
50:54 the replacing the rain forests that are
50:56 gone
50:58 fixing the bottom of the ocean where
50:59 china's destroying it with their
51:01 gigantic
51:02 nets just destroying the bottom of the
51:04 pacific ocean
51:06 no [ __ ] given man none i don't know of
51:10 any
51:11 greenpeace was created but immediately
51:13 co-opted
51:15 it's just like that guy who wrote the
51:16 book about vegetarianism back in the 70s
51:19 and then they made a movie about his
51:21 book
51:23 and it was bought out by the meat
51:26 company the books was licensed and
51:28 optioned by a meat company through a
51:30 proxy
51:30 corporation and the whole movie is about
51:33 human trafficking
51:34 and not about whether meat's good for
51:36 your bad for you
51:38 one of the biggest problems that
51:40 americans are suffering from
51:43 and this is this has been lamented by
51:46 some of the most astute brilliant
51:50 arab men who do not believe in all the
51:54 crazy stuff
51:55 like sharia law or anything totally
51:57 brilliant
51:59 200 iq guys and there's a really famous
52:03 one that lives in england and one of you
52:04 is going to know who this guy is but he
52:06 has been writing for years
52:08 that americans are absolutely the most
52:11 gullible people on planet earth
52:14 and that we're going to lose america to
52:19 his ancestors he's not in support of it
52:22 but you're going to lose it because he's
52:24 he's like where i mean we already took
52:25 over england don't worry about that this
52:27 is now a middle eastern state don't
52:28 worry about it
52:29 this is sort of how he writes he says
52:31 you guys are way too trusting
52:35 you pride yourself on your ability to
52:37 trust a stranger
52:39 and he goes where i come from nobody
52:41 trusts you at all until you prove
52:43 that you're trustworthy we got to dig in
52:47 your life and find out what you've done
52:49 to see what you stand for and the dude
52:53 is right
52:54 i mean he he puts it in words that are
52:57 gorgeous
52:58 and he's it's terrifying to read
53:01 honestly because
53:02 once you read it you're like oh my god
53:04 you know canada is this way
53:06 america's this way australia already got
53:08 totally taken over
53:09 i don't know about new zealand europe's
53:12 been taking over because when you got a
53:14 good you're really trusting
53:16 aren't you but it'll be your downfall
53:19 it's our fashion to trust it's what we
53:23 do
53:24 we it is what we pride ourselves on
53:28 maybe we should go back to a more
53:31 vetting process the membrane just like
53:34 the human membrane
53:35 of the cell by the way if you ever want
53:37 to know everything about the human cell
53:38 and have your mind blown with epigenetic
53:40 research
53:41 go get bruce lipton's book wisdom of
53:44 yourselves
53:46 used to be on youtube but he reads the
53:48 book to you and he's amazing
53:50 it's about 70 bucks but man it'll change
53:53 your life
53:54 if you dig that kind of thing but
53:57 imagine tomorrow you wake up
54:01 and it's you're gonna engage this theory
54:05 i assure you it's a reality i assure you
54:08 it's a reality
54:10 but from that point forward what you
54:12 ingest
54:14 you evaluate it instead of trusted
54:17 i think most of us are doing this today
54:21 especially in this sort of post
54:24 election united states if you're
54:26 interested in
54:27 your country becoming freer
54:31 getting your rights back and you want to
54:33 make sure america
54:34 doesn't lose its ability to help if you
54:37 happen to lose yours
54:39 we've got a bunch of people out there
54:40 supposedly helping us understand what's
54:42 going to be coming
54:44 i watched a bunch of stuff today but
54:47 we're all starting to smell
54:49 you know bs all over the place
54:53 even in the uh supposedly trusted
54:56 areas and some people have good days and
54:58 some people have bad days
55:01 trying to discuss what's going on
55:04 because they're
55:04 they don't have any more information but
55:07 they don't want to make you
55:08 think they don't have that information
55:12 this guy simon parks is one of them i
55:14 don't want to really make this
55:15 a very current affair episode but he is
55:18 in there
55:20 he has told us for weeks and weeks and
55:21 weeks that it's it's just right around
55:23 the corner it's next thursday it's
55:24 wednesday it's today it's whatever
55:26 and nothing's happening then they try to
55:29 say well a bunch of stuff's happening
55:30 but you just don't know
55:32 i hope they're all right i hope they are
55:35 i mean correct in their
55:37 information they've been getting but
55:38 it's just you know charlie ward's one of
55:40 them
55:41 one oh savan's one of them we want to
55:44 believe these people but you know who
55:45 knows
55:47 but what if we take this theory and you
55:50 never turn your radio on again
55:52 unless you're gonna blast it through
55:53 your phone into your car
55:55 off your favorite podcast your favorite
55:58 music player whatever
56:01 as far as news goes you just don't look
56:04 at it
56:04 if you're anywhere stuck watching stuff
56:07 and you know one of the big things of
56:08 course is the
56:10 the hate field the hate filled activity
56:14 of sports everybody hates everybody
56:18 except unless they like your arbitrary
56:20 team
56:21 which has nothing to do with your state
56:24 or your city
56:25 as i said back in my old competitive
56:28 episode
56:29 there's a competition episode back in
56:30 season one
56:32 the ellie dodgers aren't made at los
56:34 angeles exclusive people
56:37 right but brady goes over to the
56:41 was it the buccaneers right
56:44 wins the super bowl okay
56:47 so why are you so loyal to your team
56:50 it's just a logo man
56:51 that's all it is if you could draft
56:54 someone from around the world to be on
56:56 your team who's the best team
56:57 so what your logo wins who [ __ ] cares
57:00 man
57:01 don't you have something a little bit
57:03 bigger in life to deal with
57:05 how is that even entertaining that
57:09 everyone loses but one person oh that
57:12 sounds like a really good archetype for
57:14 mankind
57:16 it's like going to college right and and
57:18 you're
57:19 in the class of 2020
57:22 and if this was a competitive sport only
57:25 one of you would graduate and the rest
57:27 of you die in a ditch
57:30 huh what where where is that good for
57:33 your soul
57:35 to be that stressed out and to lose
57:38 your real life for all this fake crap
57:42 it's because that is a fashion of
57:44 reality all by itself
57:46 i mean probably one of the greatest
57:48 benefits to mankind is all this
57:50 kneeling crap that was going on and and
57:53 trying to say we're not going to
57:55 play it with mark cute or not is it
57:58 uh mr cuban is that the guy said he was
58:02 gonna
58:03 not play the national anthem on his nba
58:05 team and the nba said
58:07 well then you don't you have to excel
58:10 your team because your team's never
58:11 going to play
58:13 because he has to sign a contract with
58:15 the nba the nba controls what they do
58:17 now of course
58:19 they've also endorsed all this
58:22 political protesting during their games
58:27 this is a an organization just like the
58:31 nfl and all these other things where you
58:33 can't be on the field with a
58:35 shirt that's untucked or you'll get like
58:37 a fifty thousand dollar fine or
58:38 something
58:39 you can't celebrate too much after you
58:40 make a touchdown
58:42 because that's gloating and you know
58:44 participation trophy time
58:46 wow is competitiveness
58:50 important sure it is is there usually
58:53 one winner
58:55 yeah there is but to ferment
58:59 the rest of the world and some
59:02 war against each other over what amounts
59:04 to some ink on a piece of paper it's
59:06 for me it's just ridiculous that's just
59:08 my thing i've never been a big fan of
59:10 sports
59:11 you know when i was a nerd deciding to
59:15 spend my time either
59:17 doing something super creative in music
59:19 or art or something like that but i was
59:21 also a
59:22 hardcore programmer being in the
59:25 computer lab
59:26 we were all com we weren't really
59:29 competing we were all just trying to
59:30 create
59:31 games and software as kids in our teens
59:35 and i used to create games like crazy
59:37 and it was like okay
59:40 what'd you make and some dude made a
59:41 really cool database
59:43 and some i made a drag race game i made
59:45 a horse race game i made a
59:47 zork kind of game except it was a
59:49 haunted house and
59:51 they like mine and i like theirs and one
59:53 dude created a chess game
59:57 beautiful chess game you could print the
59:59 board out it would you could save your
60:00 board it was amazing
60:02 he went off and worked for google he was
60:05 the dude who ported google
60:06 maps or no google earth to the mac
60:11 okay there you go
60:14 i didn't have to lose for him to win and
60:17 he didn't have to lose for me to win
60:19 we both won we just wanted different
60:20 ways that's all
60:23 that's a fashion i dig there's a uh
60:26 i'm just gonna bounce around a few more
60:27 examples then we'll get a little deeper
60:30 in the track here
60:33 buddy of mine likes to watch a bunch of
60:35 car
60:36 videos online and there's this one guy
60:40 i think he's british and he has this
60:43 channel
60:44 and he takes his car out he gets a car
60:47 whether it's his or something he's
60:49 borrowed and then he has someone
60:50 out the window with another car and the
60:52 video will be about these two cars
60:54 racing
60:55 to some finish line they do brake tests
60:57 they do rolling start races and also
60:59 other stuff
61:00 but the guy will absolutely have a [ __ ]
61:02 fit if he doesn't win
61:04 and today i saw one where he lost every
61:07 single thing he was trying to do
61:10 and he just you saw pouty he's a grown
61:12 man in his 40s or 50s
61:15 pouting in this car because he couldn't
61:17 win
61:20 i was just like wow this is where we are
61:23 right everything's got to be a
61:25 competition and he's racing like luxury
61:27 cars against each other that shouldn't
61:29 be raced because it ain't about that
61:31 but this kid's got a 12 year old brain
61:33 you buy a bentley and
61:35 worry about whether or not it out races
61:37 some
61:38 mercedes or something it's like dude
61:41 you're missing the point
61:42 the reason why you sleep alone is
61:44 because you know your chick repellent
61:48 i think the key word that we want to add
61:51 to the
61:52 evaluation equation of various fashion
61:55 realities is integrity
61:57 i think there's a tremendous amount of
61:58 integrity in the world and i think it's
62:00 the overwhelming majority of the world
62:04 even our friends that have a hard time
62:06 getting red pilled
62:08 part of their resistance barrier is that
62:10 they are good people
62:12 and can't conceive of anything evil
62:15 and so we kind of have to you know we
62:18 want to yell at him sometimes we're like
62:20 damn it wake the hell up you're a smart
62:21 person what's your problem
62:24 but we don't know if their daddy touched
62:26 them when they were little or
62:28 or whatever but they're going towards
62:31 this evil and
62:35 the the force field is just it's just
62:38 terrifying
62:39 i mean for them it's the biggest monster
62:40 in the closet coming out
62:42 to eat them in little pieces you know i
62:44 mean it's just it freaks them out so
62:46 they
62:46 retreat go back to their little world
62:50 and it wouldn't matter as much if we
62:52 weren't having the world
62:54 destroyed by evil right now we need
62:56 everyone awake as much as possible
62:59 it's their duty to wake up i don't
63:01 expect
63:02 i mean this is not a sexist statement
63:04 but this goes back to the old chivalry
63:06 thing that i mentioned
63:08 in my chivalry is dead episode
63:12 which is i think that we can get it back
63:14 but
63:16 men typically view themselves as
63:19 protectors of their family
63:22 whether or not you're married or not
63:23 it's your family
63:25 and so part of me just automatically
63:28 says
63:29 women don't have to deal with this but
63:32 like i said earlier in the episode
63:33 women are dealing with this women are
63:35 stepping up to the plate
63:37 more so than men almost per capita in
63:39 numbers
63:41 but we expect the men to go in and see
63:44 what can't be unseen
63:46 it might be scarring might be even
63:48 instant ptsd
63:50 who knows the one thing about adam ant
63:54 that stuck with me this has to do with
63:56 the ability to deal with bad information
64:00 he made it he was it was amazing i mean
64:02 it was six-year-old
64:04 documentary he's actually healed up
64:06 quite a bit since then and
64:08 he's been on tour for years now but he
64:11 was he went back to the hospital
64:13 which he's been to a couple times and
64:16 he's sitting there and he's trying to
64:17 describe to you what it's like to be a
64:18 clinically depressed person
64:20 because if you haven't dealt with a
64:21 clinically depressed person his guitar
64:23 player
64:23 who somebody told me he died and he
64:25 didn't die he's 61 he's doing just fine
64:29 but he said and i've dated one person
64:31 like this in my life and i even
64:32 mentioned this moment in an episode a
64:34 long time ago
64:36 you don't go and ask a person who's
64:37 clinically depressed what's making them
64:39 depressed
64:40 there is no reason it's ptsd reason
64:44 something deep down inside conjures up
64:48 and this is what adam said
64:50 so the guitar shader said you don't ask
64:51 adam what's wrong with him because he'll
64:53 say i don't know
64:54 but adam said look when you go into this
64:58 depression phase after a manic phase
65:02 he goes your mind is broken it plays
65:06 tricks on you
65:07 and it just shows you all the
65:08 nightmarish thoughts
65:11 that you've ever had in your life and it
65:14 won't stop
65:16 and so you want to make the noise
65:19 stop and so that's when you get
65:21 irrational and suicidal and that sort of
65:23 stuff
65:25 in a way fashion reality is a
65:29 4d chess game you're looking out the
65:32 world
65:33 and you're thinking man it's never been
65:35 complicated before
65:37 do i really want to adopt a paradigm of
65:39 filtering that makes it complicated
65:42 well i would liken it to this
65:45 for any of you who know how to drive a
65:47 car you know that when you first started
65:49 driving your car
65:50 it was a little terrifying wasn't it
65:53 depending on if you live even if you
65:54 live in a little town it's still
65:55 terrifying because it's your relative
65:57 town it's your relative moving objects
66:00 because a car can kill anybody doesn't
66:03 matter if you're in a big town or big
66:04 city
66:04 but you know when you got in there and
66:07 you started feeling comfortable
66:08 you're still checking all your mirrors
66:10 you're thinking about where your hands
66:11 are in the steering wheel because
66:12 someone told you and you want to follow
66:13 the rules so you drive better
66:16 but eventually it becomes ubiquitous to
66:18 your character
66:20 you lived a little while figuring stuff
66:23 out if any of you have tried to detox
66:25 your body
66:26 you know that was like meticulous and
66:29 annoying as hell
66:30 i can't use underarm deodorant if it's
66:31 got aluminum in it oh [ __ ] you know what
66:33 am i gonna do
66:34 i sweat you know so you go through four
66:36 or five organic brands until you find
66:38 something good
66:39 and then it becomes ubiquitous
66:44 i think this regiment of
66:48 of reevaluating how many fashions you're
66:51 ingesting
66:53 will be a very short time and then
66:58 you'll be okay and you will have made
67:01 the decisions for yourself
67:03 now let me give a word of advice because
67:05 i'm seeing a scenario in my head
67:08 that i would love for you guys to avoid
67:11 let's say you have a partner
67:13 and maybe they're not awake completely
67:16 but maybe they made that comment about
67:18 man isn't tv horrible
67:19 you know if you're going to actually
67:23 take this
67:23 and use it and if you find
67:27 an area of reality that you think is
67:28 unhealthy for you your family
67:31 before you turn it off or request it to
67:34 be turned off or
67:35 request not to be in the room when it's
67:37 happening
67:39 do a few things explain this theory
67:42 first
67:44 and then give it like a week because
67:46 then they get to kind of think it out
67:47 themselves
67:49 you may have to compromise with a few
67:52 things
67:54 for instance i think to show bachelor of
67:56 which a girl from my hometown won the
67:58 first uh
67:59 first one i think it's
68:02 really bad for the brain i think it's
68:07 [ __ ] entertainment
68:10 i think it's just it's just it's
68:12 everything and there's a bunch of shows
68:14 out there
68:14 like this right but what if
68:17 your spouse is really into that your
68:20 girlfriend
68:21 and it's a mid-season you gotta probably
68:24 let her finish it
68:25 right i'm just giving that example
68:27 because you could be the woman
68:29 and you're trying to get your dude off
68:30 of wrestling or sports that's just
68:34 unhealthy
68:36 we always hear that domestic violence
68:37 goes up during super bowls
68:40 or during big world series events
68:43 because the woman is seeing it for what
68:46 it is
68:48 and if she tries to interfere in any way
68:49 shape or form
68:52 some guys are just children and they
68:53 lose their cool
68:56 i can't shake this desire to see
69:00 like i mentioned earlier what the past
69:02 was like
69:04 and like um i don't know very
69:07 strategically
69:09 probably like 1875 to 1880 somewhere in
69:13 there
69:14 there's cameras in the world but we
69:16 don't have movie theaters yet
69:19 i don't believe we had radio yet right
69:23 and so we lived in our own skin
69:26 we listened to our own brains any type
69:29 of entertainment were
69:30 humans actually getting together and
69:33 playing a fiddle and dancing and
69:34 whatever you do
69:35 play some bagpipes whatever it is
69:38 we knew each other a lot better we knew
69:40 ourselves a lot better
69:43 and the more that these artificial
69:44 realities are given to us through medium
69:47 enhancements we lost ourselves
69:51 even if it was entertaining there are
69:55 well actually in the movie uh the day
69:57 the earth stood still
69:59 there's a scene where clatu gets to this
70:03 house where he ends up taking up some
70:06 some he's a boarding guy
70:09 he's got a room there and there was a
70:11 scene i believe
70:13 downstairs where everyone's listening to
70:14 the radio
70:17 i don't think it was the tv but they all
70:20 just sat there and listened to the radio
70:23 like zombies and of course it's
70:25 entertaining someone's
70:27 got a comedy show they're playing some
70:29 music they've got a
70:31 sort of a soap opera and so it's
70:33 entertaining
70:35 but think about the visual of seeing
70:38 them sitting in the chair
70:41 doing nothing but being entertained
70:44 now maybe if it made him think might be
70:47 interesting
70:49 really think not memory recall like
70:51 jeopardy
70:53 i really struggle i i i'm very saddened
70:56 by the death of alex
70:57 alex trebek but there was definitely
71:01 this uh
71:03 thing and i wish i had had a chance to
71:05 meet the man i got to his set once
71:07 he wasn't there it's really weird
71:11 in real life by the way the way it's all
71:13 arranged on stage it's
71:14 nothing like the way you think it's
71:16 arranged it's very interesting i took
71:18 some pictures
71:19 but they had it all draped in cloth
71:22 but he had a coffee thing of i'm a
71:24 genius and i guess he spoke seven
71:26 languages or something
71:29 but the whole show was all about memory
71:31 recall
71:32 not thinking i don't even know how the
71:34 hell you'd make a show out of thinking
71:37 it's called iq test and it takes eight
71:40 hours to finish an episode
71:42 or it wouldn't work even brilliant shows
71:45 like cosmo
71:46 like back in the day and i know it's all
71:47 pop science trust me
71:50 actually one of the best shows that i
71:52 ever watched was called connections
71:54 i think it was out of the uk and it was
71:56 this
71:58 kind of unsung hero of science that
72:00 would start off with
72:02 i think one of the episodes i remember
72:04 was that the guy
72:06 sunk a ball on a on a pool table and he
72:08 said that the
72:09 cue ball is made out of a material that
72:12 derived from i think gunpowder or
72:14 something
72:16 i think i got that right but he would
72:18 show you this gigantic like 3 000 year
72:21 connection story with a particular
72:23 invention that we have today
72:25 and how bizarre these previous
72:28 inventions were that led to the thing
72:29 that you're
72:30 holding in your hand and on this note
72:35 the finale of this episode is to reverse
72:40 in addition to the way that we're
72:41 talking about filtering out
72:44 bad realities bad fashions of reality
72:48 someone talking to you like this right
72:50 that kind of stuff
72:52 let's filter stuff out let's also figure
72:55 out what we want to pull in
72:57 and like many of you have created your
73:00 own youtube channels and that kind of
73:01 stuff
73:02 you are projecting a reality
73:05 fashion that you think is healthy for
73:08 humanity
73:09 you're sharing something sharing your
73:11 thoughts you're sharing your research
73:14 you maybe you're an aggregator and you
73:16 present things
73:18 this show does it all right but we have
73:21 jed
73:22 over in uh scotland he's doing all kinds
73:25 of wild
73:26 amazing videos he goes all over
73:29 the history of castles in his area he
73:31 goes to museums and he
73:33 he parses his own history
73:36 utterly fascinating i can't remember if
73:39 my buddy adam richmond who's a comedian
73:41 here in la
73:43 so i heard a comedian recently i think
73:45 it was him he was talking about the
73:46 participation trophy
73:49 and he was just talking about and many
73:50 comedians have talked about this but he
73:52 says you know if i have any kids i want
73:53 them
73:54 i want them to be able to lose i want
73:56 them to be able to feel that
73:58 and so that they can you know
74:02 dedicate themselves and get better at
74:04 something it's the it's the best part of
74:06 competition
74:08 because at least the little kid teams
74:10 you know there's all kinds of wins in
74:12 the middle of
74:13 maybe not getting the complete success
74:16 and you don't have a a national
74:20 press fermenting hate on little league
74:24 it's just i enjoy playing
74:27 baseball softball whatever it is there
74:30 are so many
74:32 new um
74:35 how do i say this methods of living
74:39 that are trying to be imposed on us and
74:42 not just
74:43 medical ones as a result of this recent
74:46 scam dimmick thing where all the other
74:49 forms of death have just vanished off
74:51 the face of the planet i read a really
74:52 funny meme today someone said
74:56 whatever happened to everyone dying of
74:57 vaping
74:59 but there are ones that are more subtle
75:03 one of the biggest ones that we're all
75:05 aware of is perversion is trying to be
75:07 cleansed into
75:08 society so the perverts won't have
75:10 anyone against them
75:13 states are trying to reduce sentences
75:15 for people that do these things
75:18 gavin newsom who's going to get recalled
75:21 here real shortly
75:23 which who by the way wants to verify the
75:25 signatures on his recall
75:27 no idea to vote for your president but
75:29 boy he wants an id to kick himself get
75:31 kicked out
75:32 he's done because people are tired of
75:35 this
75:37 people are tired of this stuff they're
75:39 choosing to kick out that fashion of
75:41 reality
75:44 it's happening all over the world
75:47 i really think humanity is winning
75:50 and the only reason why we may incur a
75:53 moment of
75:54 doubt as to our winning is that this
75:57 machine that is the media
76:01 that we still haven't defunded by never
76:04 turning them on again
76:06 you realize you just if you never went
76:07 to some of these websites again
76:10 these websites uh sorry these um
76:14 yeah these businesses that give us fake
76:16 information
76:17 we'll go to business we can d platform
76:21 every single social media out there
76:25 we can we just don't have the balls to
76:27 do it i guess
76:28 we're so addicted to it
76:32 i mean i'm guilty uh the second i do a
76:35 tweet
76:36 i just did a tweet that says uh retweet
76:37 if you hate retweeting
76:40 two people retweeted that so what we're
76:42 kind of doing you know is i drop off the
76:44 videos on probably
76:46 probably five to six different social
76:47 media sites
76:49 and i try to pay attention if somebody
76:51 says something
76:53 and just for the newcomers just so you
76:54 know you'll comment a lot on the
76:57 youtube channel and it takes me a while
77:00 to
77:00 get back to every single one of you i've
77:02 been doing a little more fluent
77:03 but if you're like man i put a really
77:05 good comment and he hasn't said anything
77:07 just give it some time i'll get to it if
77:09 i push
77:10 the like button on your comment that
77:12 means at least i've read it i mean
77:13 really read it
77:15 but sometimes i will put a mental note i
77:18 need to go back and
77:19 offer a reply to that person because it
77:21 was great and i'm telling you
77:23 i've said this a few times i guess i'm
77:25 going into the bumper here but
77:28 some of the comments from some of you
77:29 folks are just as good as the episode if
77:31 not better
77:32 and some of your corrections on
77:34 information are fantastic or just add
77:35 information
77:37 so for those of you who really want to
77:40 have a good time
77:41 you're usually encouraged to put
77:42 comments in on
77:44 videos because it helps the metric on
77:46 the video and that's still true
77:48 but if you really want to engage in a
77:49 community we have a good one we have a
77:52 really really good one
77:54 so i appreciate every single one of you
77:56 for stopping by
77:58 and sharing your your dna in the
78:00 comments you know
78:02 i think in the next 12 months we're
78:04 going to have some
78:05 serious contenders and these folks will
78:08 be wiped off the face of the planet
78:10 just going to some of the little tiny
78:12 ones like gab and 107daily.com and
78:15 mines.com
78:16 and you can say anything you want on
78:18 those platforms and you know there's not
78:20 going to be a fact checker telling you
78:22 that it's it's bogus right parlor needs
78:25 to stay dead
78:26 parlor is owned by a liberal as much as
78:28 don bongino is in there or dan bongino
78:30 excuse me
78:31 uh he's the only conservative on the
78:34 whole thing and he was suckered into
78:35 investing
78:36 to give it credibility but they were
78:38 censoring all kinds of stuff towards the
78:40 end there
78:41 that should never be censored true facts
78:43 about
78:44 your rights they were censoring so
78:47 let them die erase the app off your
78:49 phone if they rebirth
78:51 don't go if they change their name just
78:53 remember
78:54 you're going back into the den funding
78:56 another
78:58 censorship platform trust me
79:01 there's too many good alternatives out
79:03 there to be going back to that swill
79:05 let those people lose all their money
79:09 but anyway hopefully this was as
79:11 interesting to you as it was to me
79:13 when i first heard this props to ian
79:16 mckellen for
79:18 sharing that on the dick cavett show
79:19 some 30 years ago
79:21 no shoot probably 40 years ago
79:25 dude's been around for a while he's born
79:27 in 1939.
79:30 so hopefully we got him in this world
79:32 for a lot longer
79:34 but if you haven't been to
79:35 deepthoughtsvideo.com that's where you
79:36 want to go and bookmark that page in
79:38 your browser somewhere just in case
79:40 we wake up one day and we've sunk
79:44 further into their
79:45 stuff there's always going to be
79:46 alternatives bitshoot.com is the 100
79:49 video alternative and so go there and
79:53 make sure and create an account creating
79:55 accounts more important than subscribing
79:56 to the show
79:57 but if you do go ahead and subscribe
79:59 while you're in there
80:01 we haven't had but probably we're up to
80:03 about 530
80:07 members now and they just it doesn't go
80:09 down i mean nobody gets kicked off
80:12 i'm still getting reports if you if you
80:15 leave this show
80:17 here's a little reverse engineering
80:19 sales pitch if you leave deep thoughts
80:22 and don't habitually watch the videos
80:24 when they come out they will unsubscribe
80:25 you without you asking for it
80:29 and i've just been looking and mulling
80:31 over the metrics
80:33 and the statistical probability of the
80:34 metrics that i'm seeing
80:36 and it is just i'm willing to bet that
80:39 youtube is probably
80:40 ignoring about 90 of the views that we
80:43 have
80:44 because i'm getting comments on videos
80:46 that aren't going up in view counts but
80:47 you can't even bring up the video
80:49 without
80:50 dinging it up one right so
80:54 uh and also remember we have hundreds
80:56 and hundreds of episodes if you dig
80:57 any one episode chances are you're gonna
80:59 dig another hundred
81:01 so get back there and take a look you
81:03 can use the website search field
81:05 to find exactly subjects that you think
81:06 you might be i haven't covered but i
81:09 have
81:09 type in titanic and you'll be like oh my
81:11 god he did it you know but there's also
81:13 a category
81:14 list there that helps you filter to what
81:15 you're most interested in
81:17 so if you like space stuff it's in their
81:19 alien stuff that's in their dreams
81:20 screenwriting
81:21 all that stuff is all in there ready to
81:23 go so there's several video options
81:25 definitely audio options social media
81:27 options
81:28 there's an all new remastered season one
81:31 season one's a little rough
81:32 i apologize again we're going to reprise
81:34 all the best episodes
81:36 we have done several this year already
81:39 there's a store i'll be adding a few
81:42 more concepts in there
81:44 for you guys and for those of you who
81:47 contribute to the show through either
81:48 paypal or patreon thank you so much
81:50 you're in the credits forever
81:51 you get the episodes typically a day
81:54 before everyone else gets
81:56 them so you get in there first get your
81:57 comments in there hopefully that's
81:59 valuable to you guys
82:01 but anyhow take care of yourself and
82:02 someone else and i'll see you on the
82:04 next deep thoughts
82:05 over now
82:14 [Music]
82:22 so
82:24 [Music]
82:32 [Applause]
82:38 [Music]
