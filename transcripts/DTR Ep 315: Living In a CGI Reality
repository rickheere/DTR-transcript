00:02 [Music]
00:23 you
00:24 [Music]
00:34 good morning deep thoughts listeners and
00:38 welcome back today I'm not quite sure
00:40 what I'm gonna call the episode it's
00:45 about that business model that
00:49 facilitates companies like NASA Jet
00:54 Propulsion laboratories and host of
00:56 other companies that are just living the
01:01 good life I want to call the episode in
01:05 my brain something like out of sight
01:09 business models and the reason I want to
01:12 do this episode is I want to get people
01:13 hip to the criminal enterprises that use
01:18 this strategy because in our normal
01:21 lives we have this all the time I don't
01:24 think about your bank account and how
01:27 you spend your money because it's your
01:29 private bank account you earned it
01:31 and you know just don't hurt me I won't
01:33 hurt you my money sure if you pull into
01:36 your driveway with some 1976
01:40 aside from entertainment purposes you
01:43 maintain your life I maintain mine you
01:46 go 1up knotch from that and you're
01:48 dealing with various business
01:50 enterprises right usually in a business
01:53 you have to come up with some service or
01:55 some products you offer to the world
01:58 hopefully there's a demand if there is
02:01 you charge a certain amount of money for
02:05 that product or service that is over
02:07 your costs and there's a profit and
02:10 hopefully you can innovate your product
02:12 or continue its quality to the point
02:14 that you continue to have a business
02:16 that you're privileged for being smart
02:17 and innovative for getting in at the
02:20 right time but for some companies like
02:23 NASA there's no such requirements I'm
02:27 not sure how they come up with their
02:28 budgets it has to be based on a
02:30 combination of operational costs for
02:36 both the real estate the employees the
02:39 research the development and the
02:43 individual projects launching something
02:46 here and launching something there
02:47 probably a lot of legacy products as
02:49 well projects excuse me so taking care
02:52 of the Voyager all those Mars rovers are
02:55 supposed to die in 11 months that are
02:57 now going on 16 years voyagers been out
03:00 there since the mid 70s then as a
03:03 spinoff from NASA you've got Jet
03:05 Propulsion laboratories or Jack Parsons
03:07 laboratories depending on how much
03:09 research you've done in this world you
03:11 have all the defense contractors and
03:13 that's where gets a little bit better at
03:15 least they have projects you're supposed
03:17 to produce planes and jets and missiles
03:20 and special weaponry you've got budgets
03:24 and deadlines sure they've got the
03:27 $12,000 toilet seat some of that's being
03:31 regulated to cut off black ops projects
03:35 it's good but think about this model of
03:38 what I'm gonna call out of sight
03:40 business you can't see what we're doing
03:44 I mean when I say you can't see what
03:48 we're doing you can't see [ __ ] nothing
03:51 unless I give you a picture to claim
03:55 that I'm showing you proof of what I'm
03:58 doing and you're gonna give me top
04:02 dollar for that picture mmm well think
04:07 about the huge transformation of all
04:10 government projects of this kind up to
04:14 the art of generating images inside of
04:17 computers now as I've had explained to
04:20 me computer-generated imagery starting a
04:23 couple different milestones the
04:27 gentleman by the name of Ivan Sutherland
04:29 was the first person to plot a pixel in
04:33 a computer screen based on data inside
04:36 the memory banks of a computer single
04:38 dot white on black within 10 years the
04:43 nuclear power plant builders and we
04:45 don't build those anymore in America
04:47 they were wondering about the radiation
04:50 coming off of reactors and so someone
04:54 figured out how to do a 2d Cartesian
04:58 system XY projection of 3d
05:01 object so it was initially designed for
05:03 some really great feedback to protect
05:04 human beings from radiation then it got
05:08 into commercials various companies paid
05:11 a tremendous amount of money for the
05:13 best computers that could get their
05:14 hands on back in the day which would be
05:17 a millionth of what you have in your
05:19 hand every day with the telephone and
05:21 for the sake of entertainment
05:23 programmers stepped in of the highest
05:26 caliber I began writing software that
05:28 would generate lettering for television
05:31 channels logos stuff lying around for
05:36 ABC and NBC eventually at all peaks
05:40 where it steps into the cinematic movie
05:43 realm for the very first time in 1982
05:45 with Tron which consequently was the
05:49 first time which would be the last time
05:51 for 10 years that they would mix
05:53 live-action camera work with 3d rendered
05:57 computer stuff all the other movies
06:00 either had a CG shot or a live-action
06:04 shot leave terminator or Jurassic Park
06:07 was the next one up it really mixed them
06:09 together well someone wrote a movie
06:11 called lookers plot of the movie was
06:15 eventually in the near future
06:18 Peter computer-generated artwork would
06:21 replace live-action human beings in all
06:24 things commercial and it was funny
06:27 because they used a very little computer
06:29 artwork in the movie but they film
06:31 live-action humans to behave like they
06:34 imagined the software to work in the
06:36 future and I'm gonna say in 20 years
06:40 lookers will will exist exactly the way
06:44 the movie thought it would so I'll take
06:47 it approximately 60 years to get what
06:51 the movie was predicting we would be and
06:54 as I told you I met two guys who moved
06:57 immediately out of the film industry
06:59 immediately into JPL worked for 13 years
07:02 creating terrain simulation software
07:05 when I pressed them on how good the
07:08 software was after 13 years they just
07:10 looked at me with the most discerning
07:13 educated eye
07:14 of CG because they are the godfathers of
07:18 CG and they look me in the eyes and they
07:21 said we can render anything and you
07:25 can't tell the difference every grain of
07:27 sand in the beach every little clod of
07:29 dirt in the mountains you can do forests
07:32 we can do deserts Martian landscapes
07:37 anything you can imagine
07:38 that's geographically sound our software
07:41 counts for Steve Jobs took an interview
07:44 just before Toy Story came out
07:47 it's that wooden table interview I
07:49 believe it's done in DC and he bragged
07:53 that there was a person on his staff at
07:54 Pixar that had a PhD make
07:57 computer-generated terrain was it 1993
08:01 how the hell do you get a PhD how do you
08:03 find peers that could grant you a PhD in
08:07 something that is so emerging that is to
08:13 illustrate that there is a tremendous
08:14 amount of expertise being developed in
08:19 the background while you and I were just
08:21 watching normal television in four by
08:24 three aspect ratio on TV consequently
08:27 these guys were quite done with their
08:30 shift when the first rover on Mars
08:33 landed I mean you got to take your
08:36 software for a spin don't you today 25
08:41 years later we have a product in
08:45 Hollywood called Terrigen there's
08:48 another one and I forget its name it's a
08:50 little bit more obscure but err gene
08:53 could render Mars in a split second in
08:56 fact it was used in the movie Martian so
08:59 why go on about CG in its history
09:02 because unlike anything in the history
09:05 of mankind other than painting which was
09:09 used by the Vatican to indoctrinate the
09:11 whole planet into thinking that Jesus
09:13 Christ gave a key to the Pope which was
09:15 done by forbidding the people to ever
09:18 paint photo-real things with paint and
09:20 then they hire Michelangelo and a bunch
09:23 of other you know amazing painters to
09:26 paint the most photo-real painting ever
09:28 of this event occurring marching people
09:30 through with an 11-mile line 11 mile
09:34 long line to see this painting of which
09:37 for their brains at the time was photo
09:39 real and reality but that jig was up
09:44 very very quickly people realized oh
09:46 that's just some pigment on a canvas on
09:49 a board now I want to do a little
09:51 comparison for you for mankind if we
09:55 were able to take back a power source a
09:59 PlayStation 4 and a TV we could show
10:05 people stuff I'd say a hundred years in
10:09 the past right now a PlayStation 4 the
10:13 average thing a little child sees and
10:16 they would believe that we had been
10:19 invaded by aliens the apocalypse had
10:22 occurred that there's very bizarre
10:24 cartoon characters that actually live in
10:27 our present time because everything they
10:29 would see on this television in 16 by 9
10:32 aspect ratio 4k rendered in real time
10:38 would be absolutely positively
10:40 convincing to the brain of a human being
10:43 I think I told the story several
10:45 episodes back that in 2000 when I worked
10:48 for Electronic Arts at a PlayStation 2 I
10:51 brought home Madden and you could set up
10:54 Madden so it could play itself and I had
10:57 a friend come over and she was
10:59 downstairs
11:00 a huge sports fan he used sportsmen I'm
11:04 upstairs she's watching my TV which was
11:07 a 60 inch rear projection TV so any any
11:10 flaws were gigantic right I come down
11:14 the stairs and she goes mad no these
11:15 games are these two teams were playing
11:17 each other today I said that's the
11:20 PlayStation she's like oh my god she
11:22 goes yeah okay something I knew
11:24 something was up what was odd is that
11:26 she wasn't blown away that she was duped
11:29 she just was like oh good I'm not wrong
11:32 about the fact that the NFL is not
11:34 scheduled some games I haven't heard of
11:36 now to the trained eye as a video game
11:39 maker you could see a lot of the
11:42 movements were a little jittery guys
11:44 return and run 90-degree angle plays but
11:49 now as many people cite you and I we may
11:53 have like a profession we do let's just
11:58 make it simple we fix engines and cars
11:59 and in Huntington Beach especially in
12:02 Orange County California
12:03 we have shops up and down the beach most
12:06 amazing bodywork places you've ever seen
12:09 building hot rods and cool things for
12:11 super rich people so each little bike
12:14 shop has some guru in it some paint guru
12:17 some bodywork guru some designer
12:21 sometimes there's a person that will
12:23 like literally build their own
12:24 carburetor they'll build something
12:26 special but what limits them from
12:29 building something amazingly ahead of
12:31 everybody else
12:32 well money access to privileged
12:37 information you know if you were to give
12:40 any these guys a zero point energy
12:42 system I'm sure they would build you a
12:43 UFO that would look super cool right but
12:48 what if you literally had infinite money
12:50 infinite resources only limited by the
12:54 very event horizon of man's education
12:58 and knowledge meaning the smartest
13:01 person in the world is the very limit of
13:04 these organizations and they have the
13:06 facilities and the equipment and again
13:09 the infinite cash resources to always
13:12 take it to the next level whatever man
13:13 can possibly figure out in this universe
13:15 they figure out now I've been around
13:18 computer-generated arts since I was yes
13:20 12 years old been programming video
13:24 games and drawing video games since I
13:27 was 11 years old been drawing digital
13:30 artwork professionally
13:32 meaning I generated all the money I
13:33 survived on since I was 18 I can tell
13:39 you if I'd had access to customers
13:41 probably my mid-teens I would have been
13:43 able to do it in my mid teens as well
13:45 the reason why I tell you that it's not
13:47 the toot my own horn but to tell you
13:49 this being pursued by several companies
13:53 in the video game industry
13:55 I have seen CG that is essentially equal
14:02 to reality and it's equal to reality and
14:06 the most coveted areas and complex
14:09 complex areas to achieve such a goal
14:12 which is to fold products like Terrigen
14:16 that render terrains
14:18 out of nothing meaning Mars doesn't
14:22 exist we really haven't been there but
14:24 boy with Terrigen and a few other
14:26 products in sublime action compositing
14:30 you wouldn't know unless I told you that
14:34 was a movie but the most astonishing
14:36 innovations have been in the portrayal
14:39 of the human form now most of us have
14:42 seen avatar we've seen Benjamin Button
14:45 we've seen fast and furious were you
14:50 know they replaced a guy in two hundred
14:51 and seventy five shots using his
14:53 brother's body in his face no one could
14:56 tell the difference I was solicited by a
14:59 company I'm gonna say ten years ago just
15:04 a friend of a friend I went to this
15:06 business and Los Angeles and this
15:10 Harvard graduates selling trying to get
15:13 me to use his product which is to create
15:16 ultra realistic 3d phases based on CG
15:20 models and then you can have any one
15:22 puppeteer it with a CG face rig and
15:26 again most of you who've seen avatar
15:29 from 2007 you're very familiar with this
15:31 technology you've seen Planet of the
15:33 Apes you familiar with this technology I
15:35 will tell you that what I saw ten years
15:38 ago in 2008 makes that [ __ ] lay down and
15:43 take it a nap
15:44 I saw a demo with a leaves like an Asian
15:50 girl controlling this black African
15:53 tribe leader with I mean she's young and
15:56 porcelain and beautiful perfect and this
15:59 tribesman is aged and he's wrinkled with
16:04 war paint on
16:05 you know they did cheat a little bit in
16:08 that they didn't put the hair on the guy
16:09 and the tribesman that all works because
16:11 they shave their heads right but the
16:15 typical velocity problems that you have
16:18 with CG faces were Jeff Bridges and Tron
16:20 Legacy just looks creepy as [ __ ] you
16:26 know when you when a actor moves their
16:28 mouths there's a there's a velocity of
16:30 how the mouth moves and we just know it
16:32 because we look at people since we've
16:34 been alive right so something very
16:37 artificial about the way Hollywood is
16:39 incapable of animating this but the
16:41 stuff I saw was perfect and I mean
16:44 perfect and I asked the guy said well
16:48 this is phenomenal I said this is way
16:51 beyond any of the games that I'm
16:53 developing need but I will definitely
16:56 pass around the word but I said worse
16:59 has come from where'd this technology
17:01 come from and the dude looked at me and
17:04 he goes because well we're allowed to
17:06 say now just recently as a matter of
17:08 fact by the way the security get into
17:11 this office was ridiculous and he kind
17:16 of confessed that these two things were
17:17 related but he said something to the
17:20 effect of this guy was in one of the
17:22 alphabet agencies and this technology
17:25 has been used within that agency now I
17:30 remember when that day happened where a
17:35 few buildings fell down a lot of fake
17:40 evidence came out against the guy they
17:42 accused and one of them was a very photo
17:45 real shot of the guy they accused doing
17:48 and hanging out with another guy who was
17:50 involved with the Klan that was supposed
17:52 to supposedly
17:53 the ones responsible for doing it photo
17:57 real and then a personality on the
18:01 internet who is known for debunking such
18:03 things said that the BBC actually
18:07 admitted having this photo generated to
18:10 accompany an article that they had
18:12 written asserting that these two
18:13 gentlemen had actually met each other
18:14 and I'm Roberto at the photograph
18:18 I couldn't believe my eyes it look photo
18:21 real like photo photo real there is a
18:24 brilliant philosopher in America and his
18:26 name was Marshall McLuhan his phrase the
18:31 phrase that he came up with it made him
18:32 famous that he's most famous for his
18:35 medium is the message he coined the
18:39 phrase media that's why we call it mass
18:43 media if you boil his whole or one wing
18:47 of his entire exploration down and he's
18:50 known for several things
18:51 several ingenious epiphanies about
18:54 mankind after he studied language for a
18:58 long time in the evolution of linear
18:59 language and how that developed the
19:00 brain he was born like me he was born
19:04 before television existed I was born
19:06 before Internet
19:08 HTTP protocol existed meaning the visual
19:11 kind of Internet that we're all used to
19:12 right so he watched the evolution of
19:15 television mold the minds of kids and he
19:19 said this is what you need to know about
19:21 media he said that the method by which
19:25 you get information is actually more
19:27 important than the information that you
19:29 get when you first hear that you're like
19:33 what the hell are you talking about
19:35 we'll think about it in your lifetime
19:37 now you can understand what he was
19:39 trying to say but we're gonna use
19:41 computer-generated imagery as the coup
19:45 de Gras for your brain to understand
19:47 what he was talking about in the late
19:48 60s when he was able to deliver such a
19:52 revelation to his people by using
19:54 television why do people believe in the
19:58 moon missions who were alive when it
20:00 happened because they saw it on
20:03 television
20:04 like I said 1969 the amount of technical
20:09 jobs that people had the world was very
20:11 few and Hollywood special effects were
20:16 probably one of the most coveted forms
20:19 of knowledge that one could have today
20:22 computer graphics although known by tens
20:26 of thousands of people in the world is
20:28 is actually becoming further and further
20:31 distant
20:31 from your average human being now you
20:35 might be able to go to a bar and find a
20:37 guy who's you know two sheets to the
20:39 wind and ask him well do you know a
20:42 computer Jimmer generated imagery is and
20:44 they'll say oh yeah that's when they
20:46 make it on you know computers and then
20:48 you say well what do you think the first
20:50 steps are it's actually doing that let's
20:52 say I want to make a soccer ball what do
20:55 you do well I have no idea it's all just
20:58 in the computers then ones and zeros
21:01 that's your average human being for I
21:04 mean even should even say in ones and
21:06 zeros that's I said in the next level of
21:08 the average human being now the thing is
21:10 there's no reason why the average human
21:12 being should know this information
21:13 necessarily except that it's being used
21:16 to manipulate them I actually know that
21:18 I'm gonna call this episode now who
21:21 we're on the right track take the
21:25 average human mind it takes a little
21:27 while to figure stuff out right first
21:29 you're just waking up you're getting
21:31 motor control of your body you're
21:34 adopting millions and millions of
21:36 paradigms so that you can kind of exist
21:39 the consensus reality thing right but
21:43 little do you know as a baby in 2018 so
21:50 you're born in January so you're 11
21:51 months old starting to walk starting to
21:54 tackle maybe your gibberish is starting
21:56 to sound like words that your elders
22:00 people who've been around 20 30 40 years
22:04 before you existed I've already figured
22:07 out how to move photons into your
22:09 eyeballs sounds into your ear that will
22:14 portray any reality they want you to
22:16 believe exists you might even adjust
22:21 your perception of reality the more
22:24 you're inundated by CG reality now we
22:28 don't like to think about it but I think
22:30 it's safe to say that for every
22:33 experiment that they could do on human
22:34 beings they're probably doing it
22:36 somewhere in this planet or have already
22:38 completed such an experiment cloning
22:40 human beings poorly just like in aliens
22:42 for
22:43 it's probably already been done the
22:46 island of dr. Moreau it's already been
22:50 done there's off the coast of New York
22:51 right here something that we kind of
22:53 advanced science would that facilitate
22:58 in a group of people if they knew a hell
23:00 of a lot more about how your brain work
23:01 than you did most of you are familiar
23:04 with projects where people are made into
23:06 Manchurian candidates the MKULTRA
23:08 program if you ask an average American
23:11 are Americans getting smarter or dumber
23:15 you'd have to say dumber at this current
23:18 state we're trying to change things it's
23:20 going to take some big big changes in
23:23 education in this country financing
23:25 education getting rid of these tenured
23:27 teachers that have never had a real
23:29 [ __ ] job in their life you know it's
23:31 ok if you're teaching you know maybe K
23:34 through ninth grade but ten eleven
23:38 twelve should be taught by professionals
23:40 that have been in the world they really
23:42 they really should even if it's a
23:43 science class they should have been in
23:45 the real world at least ten years before
23:47 they come back and try to teach kids
23:49 something because they don't know what's
23:52 important if they just read it out of
23:54 European class books that are written
23:56 for Americans right but now haven't you
23:59 heard of scams that people run on old
24:02 people or people that are very innocent
24:05 they sweep into a little little town in
24:08 the Midwest somewhere when they say
24:10 they've got a farm somewhere growing
24:13 emus or they are investing in something
24:18 they've seen on TV hey you want to be a
24:20 part of rebuilding Dodger Stadium well I
24:22 have an inn and it's a bunch of people
24:25 coming together to finance this rebuild
24:27 of a skyscraper here this bridge over
24:30 there the zoo maybe it's a charity
24:35 they're using to extort money and
24:37 emotions out of people and so these
24:39 people will give them money sign a bunch
24:41 of fake paperwork and those people run
24:45 off with all the dough it's an out of
24:48 sight out of mind business model or in
24:50 that particular case the jig gets up
24:52 pretty quickly but the only way they can
24:54 sustain more investment from these
24:56 individuals if they want to come back
24:57 can visit for a double-dip its to bring
25:00 them visual evidence well hey you know
25:02 everything is going great you know that
25:03 dividend is gonna come back next year
25:05 and here's some photographs of the
25:06 construction site all they need to do is
25:09 take a picture of a construction site
25:10 and tell them that they're actually
25:11 paying for it what it has completely
25:13 nothing to do with their business I know
25:16 what you're thinking like oh we got the
25:17 Internet to protect us now not really if
25:20 you get on your tone two feet go talk to
25:23 people if someone looks up a
25:25 construction site and says man I don't
25:27 see your name on the list oh you're like
25:29 oh no that company right there yeah
25:30 we're a part of that company here's the
25:32 paperwork fake fake fake fake fake oh I
25:34 get it yeah yeah you know they found us
25:36 and we're actually actually a secret you
25:39 know richer Capital Group that gets them
25:42 the construction money but the problem
25:45 with that is it's a Ponzi scheme you're
25:46 going to get caught and you're gonna get
25:48 caught pretty quick the amount of labor
25:50 that you have to go through to take away
25:52 more money and more money to vanish from
25:54 everyone's sight when today everything's
25:56 tracked digitally if they report you to
25:58 the authorities man you will have had to
26:00 have covered your tracks in a major
26:01 major way but what if the business was
26:06 protected by a fleet of folks that could
26:11 convince you that the product actually
26:14 got built now most the time people
26:16 invest in businesses to make money back
26:18 I'll give you a thousand bucks you give
26:19 me two thousand bucks back all right I
26:22 helped you have something that you
26:24 wanted that you couldn't afford
26:26 that's what capitalism is when you need
26:29 to raise money for your vision that's
26:30 all capitalism is okay but now what if
26:34 the only reward that you got was
26:37 bragging rights with your friends you
26:39 see I came in here's the thing and I had
26:43 this happen to me when I was a kid when
26:44 I was um let's see nine years old ten
26:48 years old
26:48 those two years my best friend's stepdad
26:53 was friends with some astronauts that
26:56 went to the moon and he told us he goes
27:00 my friend wrote my name in the surface
27:03 of the Moon didn't have a picture of it
27:06 but he said he did it and so they
27:08 believed each other and that was it I
27:09 did pay as much
27:11 any money for that but my god the
27:13 bragging rights of that holy [ __ ] could
27:15 you imagine we actually went up there
27:17 it's kind of a neat little idea you're
27:19 right every with all your friends a name
27:20 in the and the soil up there
27:22 supposedly it's not gonna get altered
27:24 because there's no atmosphere but what
27:27 is NASA do when they go to the moon well
27:32 they're bringing back supposedly moon
27:34 rocks they turn into petrified trees
27:36 later on again we can find tons of rocks
27:40 that aren't from Earth
27:41 just by looking in the snowcaps of you
27:45 know the South Pole of the North Pole or
27:48 the deserts there's a lot of guys that
27:50 search for that stuff which clubs that
27:51 search for meteorites following out of
27:53 the sky iron or meteorites okay it
27:57 sounds pretty easy to take a bunch of
27:59 money especially billions and billions
28:02 of dollars in the 60s and 70s right if
28:06 somebody actually made a decent point
28:07 because I've asked you know you know
28:11 that one of the moon hoax questions is
28:13 if we really went then why hasn't any
28:15 other country gone since America has
28:17 gone right and one of the responses I
28:20 thought was fairly intelligent which
28:21 said they don't have enough money to
28:23 even try it
28:25 now we know that China has enough money
28:28 to do anything that America has done in
28:30 the past especially 50 years ago right
28:34 now I would wager two things in the real
28:39 world they simply haven't stolen enough
28:42 technology to actually pull it off but
28:44 two things don't cost as much as they
28:47 did back in the day because all that
28:49 stuff was bleeding edge technology
28:51 if the Saturn 5 is capable of taking off
28:54 and getting to the moon which it's not
28:56 they could build that in a much smaller
28:59 package with the same amount of thrust
29:01 for the same payload like the Falcon
29:03 series of SpaceX again if they can get a
29:08 satellite to Mars okay they can push a
29:11 human to the moon but now what does
29:14 China not have what does Russia not have
29:18 I don't think they had the CG machine
29:21 that we have
29:22 they're getting close China supposedly
29:26 has an ISS of its own they tend to make
29:29 more mistakes with their ISS simulator
29:32 big bubbles that flow in front of their
29:35 masks and a bunch of other things but I
29:38 don't think they have a we have which is
29:40 the virtual reality machine for the
29:43 out-of-sight out-of-mind business model
29:45 that is NASA that might be SpaceX you
29:49 know SpaceX never put a rover in orbit
29:52 around the earth they just didn't okay
29:54 that car would have absolutely bent
29:56 torqued blown up tires would have
29:59 exploded it's an absolute impossibility
30:02 that that ever really occurred but the
30:05 guy rendered this thing in a laboratory
30:08 I mean in a in a soundstage right and
30:10 then pumped it out to the public and
30:13 created interest in a public company
30:15 I think SpaceX is public please created
30:19 interest in his company for investors to
30:21 then borrow against an event it never
30:23 really occurred now if you think about
30:26 it these guys could wink at the
30:27 investors and say that's all [ __ ]
30:29 you know but the public's so [ __ ]
30:31 stupid they don't know the difference so
30:33 you're gonna invest in something that
30:35 everyone believes in and we're gonna get
30:36 a bunch of real projects launching
30:38 things into space and you're gonna make
30:42 money trust me you're gonna make money
30:44 that's what Elon Musk tells everybody so
30:48 Marshall McLuhan's come back for a
30:49 second posthumous run in this world the
30:54 medium is the message it is more
30:56 important how we receive the information
30:58 than the information itself now in our
31:02 case since we're paying out tens of
31:04 millions of dollars every single day to
31:07 these organizations
31:08 okay you might you might see these
31:12 things as almost a 50/50 the CG is just
31:15 as important as the lies that they're
31:18 telling the public for a lot of you who
31:22 are disputing where we are in the
31:25 universe
31:26 I've never you know it's really
31:28 interesting last couple of moon episodes
31:30 I've had an astonishing amount of people
31:33 come up to me and say this this
31:35 guy still thinks that space exists you
31:38 still thinks runaround ball it's
31:41 interesting I think where that comes
31:44 from is that people are so disgusted
31:46 with the organization's that tell us
31:48 where we are that tell us where the how
31:50 the universe started what planets are
31:52 what space is what the Milky Way is an
31:55 etc etc when they take these really
31:57 intense zoom cameras when they zoom upon
32:01 stars and they see this crazy electric
32:05 plasmasphere this just got glowing you
32:09 know electricity around it you know some
32:13 of these things have like Mohawks and of
32:16 electricity around them and they'll move
32:21 the camera and the Mohawk doesn't change
32:24 they hold still and the Mohawk doesn't
32:26 change so the problem with people saying
32:29 that that's just atmospheric distortion
32:30 is that if you held still the atmosphere
32:33 would move and you see these movies to
32:35 where they stuff crawls all over this
32:36 ball okay
32:37 very electric in nature but if it was
32:41 something in the camera's sensor if you
32:43 move the camera then the Mohawk would
32:45 move because the camera is a pixelated
32:47 grid of receivers right catching the
32:50 photons just kind of like your eyeball
32:51 does and turns it from analog to
32:53 electric right but the Mohawk doesn't
32:57 move so they're like whoa where are we
33:02 what is this
33:03 maybe I don't believe anything anymore
33:06 what astonishes me a little bit does
33:10 that individuals will know that NASA
33:12 lies about these kind of things but they
33:14 come to NASA's defense because it is a
33:17 paradigm of pride in their life
33:21 usually only Americans only Americans
33:23 who do this and old ones at that I don't
33:27 stress enough quite frankly that every
33:30 single picture of the earth that nASA
33:32 has ever submitted has been the most
33:35 laughable hoax besides perhaps the blue
33:38 marble shot which then screwed up the
33:40 Red Sea and one a few years back it's
33:46 fairly pretty but then there's a whole
33:48 video
33:49 provided by NASA of the artists that
33:51 composited together he was interviewed
33:53 he took the whole thing apart in
33:55 Photoshop and told you how he composited
33:57 it all together so that one's not a shot
33:59 from space it's a bunch of little shots
34:02 of high-altitude things right now we
34:04 have been to Mars according to NASA so
34:07 many freaking times that we should have
34:10 a high-definition camera shot of
34:14 approaching Mars from deep space a
34:17 little red dot zoom up to it
34:20 time lapse at its rotation its position
34:24 in the star constellations right you
34:27 should be able to see the stars behind
34:28 it until we get up to it maybe they have
34:32 to change the aperture just a little bit
34:33 but again digital cameras are way
34:35 different than old film cameras right so
34:38 we can have a lot of things in focus at
34:41 the same time in digital cameras you'll
34:43 have big depth of field problems if we
34:45 don't want it we should be able to see
34:47 it land now there was the footage
34:50 supposedly of the Titan moon landing I
34:52 believe of Saturn right is crazy
34:56 spinning wobbly photo sequence which was
35:00 breathtaking when you think it's real it
35:04 then lands and of course it dies
35:05 SuperDuper fast because that's the game
35:08 as well we don't want to be on the hook
35:09 for the whole thing Jesus we're just
35:12 here to sell a bite-sized piece of
35:15 information for the short attention span
35:17 that is the world today you talk
35:20 politics with someone if they're
35:22 informed they speak in their own words
35:24 if they're not inform they speak in
35:25 sound bytes provided by some liberal
35:28 media organization just that's the way
35:30 it works right in that particular case
35:33 it's a very black-and-white circumstance
35:35 that you can understand about their tiny
35:37 brains
35:38 I felt can't las' conversations with
35:41 liberals that don't realize that every
35:44 single word that's coming out of their
35:45 mouth as a headline somewhere and one of
35:48 their favorite fake news organizations
35:50 but NASA's top-notch stuff right you can
35:56 hate them all you want
35:57 there are ISS footage is the best
36:00 fakeri you've ever seen in your life yes
36:03 they make gigantic mistakes I'm not
36:05 talking about the mistakes when they're
36:06 not making mistakes something powerful
36:08 is going on all right now again they've
36:12 never in any of the footage I've ever
36:13 seen taking a camera and pointed it at
36:15 the moon from inside the ISS ever they'd
36:19 never filmed the Milky Way from the ISS
36:20 ever
36:21 they never filmed a single star from the
36:24 ISS ever so these are things that would
36:27 occur if you truly had a space station
36:29 in fact it would probably be one of the
36:30 first things you would send home to your
36:32 family you just take your iPhone your
36:34 Android you put it up against the window
36:36 and snap a shot of the Milky Way that
36:38 would be utterly breathtaking with the
36:40 moon right there and all this other
36:41 stuff there would be no aperture
36:44 problems as they have asserted so many
36:46 times and even if there were aperture
36:49 problems you would take your camera and
36:51 adjust it such that it would it would
36:55 show the Milky Way but you know how a
36:56 cell phone camera works if you can see
36:58 it with your eyeballs the cell phone
36:59 camera takes the picture doesn't it but
37:02 hope you can see it's in the shot yeah
37:04 sure your Android camera blows away your
37:06 iPhone camera and then Apple tells you
37:08 that theirs is better you're staring
37:10 through your broke screen but NASA is
37:14 the best you know and again you've got
37:18 organizations with fleets of programmers
37:22 that are the best programmers on planet
37:24 Earth
37:25 I've had close friendships with at least
37:27 one of these individuals and his grasp
37:30 of 3d was phenomenal for those of you
37:33 who dabble in the graphic products you
37:37 might remember a product in the 90s
37:39 called Bryce I think it still exists it
37:42 was named after Bryce Canyon and then
37:45 someone said knows the name dr. his son
37:47 that's names Bryce whatever but it led
37:49 you to generate 3d canyons with you
37:52 could just lift the water table you
37:54 could make an ocean you make it a lake
37:55 you could put whatever type of sky you
37:57 want it in there turjun has these things
37:59 as well it looked pretty damn real for
38:04 the 90s because your brain was like oh
38:05 my God look at that fractal mountain it
38:08 looks like soil and then you educate
38:09 your mind and geology and you're not
38:12 real
38:12 but it was really cool but today it's
38:14 perfect okay but my friend
38:17 I remember saying goodbye to him on a
38:20 Friday Friday afternoon and by Sunday
38:24 night he had generated his own Bryce I
38:28 said you know what is this product he
38:31 says I had something dabble in this
38:32 thing all weekend
38:33 his settings were way more intense way
38:35 more detailed if you control kinds of
38:39 the fractal patterns and where you
38:40 wanted them so these guys exist and they
38:43 just crap algorithms that would take you
38:46 ten years to master
38:47 perhaps it took them ten years to master
38:49 but they exist right so I know that some
38:53 of you have seen a lot of these fake CG
38:55 videos go all over the internet and your
38:57 relatives will post them into social
38:59 media feeds and they'll say oh my god
39:01 look at this one of the most famous ones
39:04 I mentioned it before is the guy that
39:06 did the the fake amusement park with
39:10 these rides that are absolutely
39:11 technically probably impossible to make
39:14 you know these you know was like an arm
39:18 hook to an arm hook to an arm you got in
39:19 this little car and it was just fly you
39:21 up and you're like you know a quarter
39:22 mile in the air sort of thing and it was
39:25 all CG but it was so unbelievably well
39:28 done that your brain has to deny it only
39:32 based on the technical principles that
39:35 would make these rides exist like us--
39:38 essentially put on the brakes and away
39:41 this can't be real
39:42 it looks real but those physics will not
39:46 support metal doing what these things
39:49 are doing right so you've seen that and
39:54 you're the sort of the cg police right
39:56 you go around all these social medias
39:58 post every once in a while maybe once a
40:00 month or once every couple weeks and
40:01 you're like oh okay that's fake that's
40:05 CG yeah that's Photoshop and you're
40:07 letting people know there's two
40:09 realities out there and you're buying
40:11 both of them but one of them is
40:13 completely artificial well again if it's
40:16 for entertainment if it's commercial hey
40:20 more power to meeeee coca-cola's got
40:22 some crazy CG thing where
40:25 he looks like a 747 coming for landing
40:29 and it transforms into a transformer
40:30 coke transformer and it delivers coke to
40:32 all the kids
40:34 yeah maybe there's a hillbilly somewhere
40:36 that thinks that that's real but you're
40:39 like Apple that doesn't exist
40:40 obviously that exists it we wouldn't
40:42 fight wars that way we fight them right
40:44 but they're just trying to get eyeballs
40:46 on their product on their logo so when
40:49 you go to the the restaurant coke feels
40:52 good it's like that's the one with the
40:53 robot [ __ ] I'm getting a coke I think
40:56 most of us are excited about going to a
40:58 movie that has amazing computer graphics
41:01 we love that we love our ILM s and our
41:04 Weta's and digital domains and pixel
41:08 mundos we love them marzo --ax but what
41:13 if someone's taking your tax dollars and
41:17 wasting them and promising you that the
41:20 progress the technical progress of man
41:22 has advanced far beyond where it
41:25 actually has now you might say well no
41:28 that's good it's creating them jobs for
41:30 whatever country is doing this I think
41:32 primarily it's America right now
41:34 eventually you know CG will get over to
41:38 China and Russia and anyone else who
41:39 wants to play the games I mean North
41:41 Korea did a pretty good job with their
41:43 CG convincing people they had nuclear
41:44 weapons ha ha ha but now what if there's
41:49 an earth Giller on its way
41:51 big-ass Rock it may not blow up the
41:54 entire planet but boys are gonna do a
41:56 job on wherever it hits a hemisphere of
41:59 where it strikes everybody's dead I
42:01 could maybe the whole world just dies
42:02 because there's so much crap in the air
42:04 we can't get enough Sun to keep our
42:06 crops going right
42:08 now we have been in this emperor has
42:10 closed on mode for 50 to 100 years you
42:15 know say we got another 150 to go and
42:18 you think this technology exists that we
42:22 can go into space we can hop on a
42:24 freakin you know asteroid and split it
42:29 up and move it around because you've
42:32 seen it it's been portrayed in some CG
42:35 fantasy by these organizations that
42:38 consumed the money that could be
42:40 otherwise used to actually accomplish
42:41 these goals a business and a corporation
42:46 has one motive and if you ever buy a
42:50 book on forming a corporation you've
42:52 never read one before the principles of
42:54 a normal corporation of a healthy
42:55 corporation it's sort of depressing
42:58 you will learn very quickly that the
43:00 employees are not the priority the
43:04 corporation and its profits of the
43:05 priority and you are to engage in the
43:09 highest profit for the lowest margin
43:11 possible meaning the path of least
43:13 resistance is ready to spend all your
43:15 time why do you think all the products
43:17 that we buy fall apart what creates an
43:19 ecosystem where people need to buy
43:21 replacements but to its you making a
43:24 product selling it for full price for a
43:26 cheaper and cheaper cost to you is it
43:31 any wonder you know Apple makes cheaper
43:34 and cheaper products more and more
43:36 defects more and more problems latest
43:38 round of iPhones has a huge screen
43:40 problem they just announced it this
43:43 morning it's because they make it
43:46 cheaper and cheaper well correct me if
43:49 I'm wrong but their phones just get more
43:51 and more expensive right if you can
43:55 charge more money a corporation is
43:56 supposed to charge more money that's
43:58 just the way it goes I think in very
44:01 simple terms there's going to come a
44:03 time where we're going to need this
44:04 technology to exist but it probably
44:08 won't exist but there's going to be a
44:10 hell of a reckoning of which mankind
44:14 won't be able to do anything about
44:15 because mankind has crawled into a CG
44:18 reality
44:19 now just like the moon missions just in
44:21 case anyone's going down this path the
44:24 very few people have to be involved with
44:26 the hoax and the way that they've set
44:27 these organizations up everyone's
44:30 looking at monitors to prove to
44:32 themselves that these things are
44:33 actually doing what they say they are
44:35 Rockets are taking off they're landing
44:36 on again asteroids and Mars and what
44:41 have you going deep into space but in
44:45 all cases they have to take a feed from
44:47 somewhere to prove to themselves that
44:50 what they're getting is real now I've
44:54 had a lot of debate in the comment
44:55 sections about the Mars missions and
44:57 people that know people which is cool
45:00 and these people are not defending
45:02 anything that's going on they're just
45:04 reporting in but the the average time it
45:08 takes for light to travel to Mars is
45:11 about nine minutes and then it's got to
45:14 do something and then it's gonna take
45:15 nine minutes to come back okay in 18
45:20 minutes with supercomputers today hell
45:23 even the ones that we just know about
45:24 they could generate anything intelligent
45:26 or special custom software that you
45:30 could ever need to exist
45:33 plus there's very few movements and
45:36 activities in these organizations GPL
45:38 included where their day isn't scheduled
45:41 what are you gonna do tomorrow we're
45:42 gonna drive her closer to the canyon
45:44 okay and so off off the little worker
45:49 bees go that are on the inside of the
45:51 scam they pre generate all the imagery
45:53 you'd ever need so the next day it's
45:55 completely ready completely ready
45:58 maybe you fondle the controls of your
46:01 you know JPL s you know CG simulator
46:04 where you are cuz that's what they use
46:06 they use a CG world to give the
46:10 supposedly the real Rover on Mars its
46:12 directions but they're looking you just
46:14 look it up on the internet they're
46:15 looking at a computer-generated low res
46:18 poly
46:19 of the rover and so they grab a joystick
46:22 when they move it well they're moving a
46:26 CG representation of the vehicle on Mars
46:29 and so if there are any anomalies in the
46:32 way it moves
46:33 the way it leans anything like that it's
46:35 already predetermined in this rendering
46:37 thing now if it was real and you had
46:39 another camera setup which doesn't exist
46:42 to film the rover and it was a live feed
46:44 you know speed of light no delay and you
46:48 move the rover and you watched it
46:50 accidentally tip over then your CG
46:55 people would have a problem oh my god it
46:56 tipped over I'm not gonna do something
46:59 you know a group of guys because well
47:00 we'll start rendering it on its side
47:01 just in case but you better call the
47:03 head brass man it looks like this is
47:06 over but we don't have that problem do
47:10 be because the software is going to
47:12 prevent anything catastrophic from
47:14 occurring it's going to keep going and
47:15 keep going and keep going as long as
47:18 they give you pictures generated in a
47:20 computer you're gonna believe that
47:22 that's really there
47:23 you're gonna take pride in the fact that
47:25 you're part of a country that
47:26 facilitated that and again you believe
47:29 that those genes of your genes okay
47:32 technically speaking we're all part of
47:34 the same race the human race and if any
47:36 human being can accomplish something
47:37 then you have a shot yourself there's a
47:42 great movie out there which is George
47:44 Lucas's first feature film it was his
47:48 student film that did really really well
47:50 I'd love to see a student film but it's
47:52 called thx 1-1 3-8
47:54 he made it with Robert Duvall who was a
47:59 you know massively famous character
48:01 actor back in the day still is and he
48:07 recently updated about ten years ago got
48:09 rid of some old scenes that he didn't
48:11 like and he made it more realistic to
48:13 the time frame but you have a group of
48:16 people living in a dystopian 1984
48:20 totally complete universe everybody's
48:23 bald everyone wears white they work in
48:25 this weird factor it looks like a
48:27 Manhattan Project what looks like
48:28 they're mixing you know plutonium they
48:32 watch their entertainment night is these
48:35 cops which are robot cops think your
48:37 Boston Dynamics thing looks like bike
48:40 cops from back in the day but they have
48:41 silver faces with no eyeballs or
48:43 anything it's just like a mannequin face
48:45 they have cattle prods
48:47 they used to keep you in line but the
48:49 entertainment at night is watching
48:50 people get tortured by these guys and
48:53 they just sit and watch they have no
48:54 emotions they take medicine every day to
48:58 keep their brain from being cognitive so
49:02 they're complete serfs and it was an
49:04 article released in the last week that's
49:06 talked about the fact that society will
49:08 eventually worship an AI Jesus and AI
49:12 Savior than AI religion like quite
49:16 literally speaking in this article well
49:19 in that movie there's a booth a phone
49:21 booth that one goes to to confess and
49:24 it's a picture of the very Jewish
49:26 looking Jesus and our that guy character
49:30 goes in for a few confessions and it's
49:33 just just a real basic AI that
49:35 reiterates what you say makes you feel
49:37 better about yourself when you go back
49:39 out into this horrible world with no
49:41 emotions no empathy of any kind
49:43 then there's the movie matrix I want to
49:47 put these two out there and we're gonna
49:48 slam them together
49:50 you've got the matrix which is obviously
49:53 thousand years perhaps several hundred
49:56 years past thx 1138 where that same
49:59 society has been now jammed into pods
50:02 human beings are a gigantic battery
50:05 array kept satiated in their cocoons by
50:08 a virtual reality that is just exactly
50:11 like the one that we're in now hmm now
50:16 I'll tell you this because this comes up
50:19 a lot I could probably make an episode
50:21 every season about my further thoughts
50:23 and the matrix you know maybe I'll do a
50:25 part two this year here's a little
50:27 preview if that were to occur there's
50:31 this minor debate I would say online
50:33 about whether or not our world is round
50:35 or flat a flat disc not a flat square
50:38 like a Kansas album but a flat disc
50:41 again the moon looks like a burned-out
50:43 star the moon is the same side as the
50:45 Sun in the sky seems like it's a
50:48 regulated size for something that's
50:50 inspiring growth on earth some of us see
50:53 proof that it's round I happen to think
50:56 expanding earth is a perfect explanation
50:58 for why we are the way we are
51:00 my reprisal of ether thanks to Eric
51:04 dollar teaching me Tesla's papers all
51:07 the way back to Faraday I believe I
51:10 understand exactly how that works now
51:12 thus how gravity works okay but what do
51:16 we do when we bring a rodent a reptile
51:20 or an insect home as a pet what do we do
51:24 what does ooze do when they want to
51:27 capture a bunch of silverback monkeys or
51:30 whatever they build a world that is an
51:36 approximation of what they're familiar
51:39 with in their native environments right
51:40 a lot of these creatures are actually
51:42 born in zoos unfortunately and so they
51:44 have actually no knowledge of their
51:46 native world and when they're released
51:47 into the native world they get murdered
51:49 by their cousins what are we doing a
51:53 fish tank yeah we put some rocks on the
51:55 bottom when you fill it with pirate
51:57 ships and little tiny divers but we put
52:00 plants in there and we oxidate the water
52:02 so that it's just like the ocean water
52:04 or a pond water so they have plenty of
52:07 oxygen to metabolize out of the water
52:10 some people have tarantulas right they
52:12 built those little things okay so we're
52:14 doing this all the time as human beings
52:17 but for those that can't debate without
52:21 again you know counting like little
52:26 babies I don't know what the deal is
52:27 with it I don't know why keeping an open
52:29 mind is so hard right but they can't
52:33 imagine that some would would make a
52:35 disc of land that when analyzed in a
52:41 normal way would give away the clues
52:44 that they're actually in a heliocentric
52:45 ball for me they've deceived me if it's
52:48 the case with the notion that the
52:50 continents have all shifted away from
52:53 each other right you know we know that
52:54 South America and Africa were all one
52:57 piece and if you take stray you can put
53:00 it up against South America if you bring
53:03 the whole thing together that makes a
53:05 much smaller ball because it all
53:06 connects on all sides right that's why I
53:11 think it's round
53:12 but I could be deceived because someone
53:16 is creating a tank that is going to be
53:19 proportionate to my intelligence if a if
53:22 an insect or a rodent or whatever is zoo
53:25 animal simply looked around and went
53:27 okay this is complete [ __ ] none of
53:31 this is real
53:31 I refuse to eat I refuse to be here I'm
53:34 just gonna die screw you and the zoo
53:37 start looking at everyone get emaciated
53:39 in the zoo
53:40 all the animals rejecting it your insect
53:42 starts moving real slow your fish start
53:45 floating you know you're going to
53:47 probably either release them to the wild
53:51 or you're gonna try to build a better
53:53 enclosure such that they can't discover
53:55 that they're in a matrix of some sort a
53:57 fish tank is a matrix isn't it sure as
54:00 hell ain't the ocean it's not a pond
54:03 it's not real don't know that's for some
54:07 people a huge stretch for their brains
54:09 and again these people get butthurt they
54:11 paused the video they stopped the video
54:12 they go in the comments and you know
54:14 they'll tell me something I've actually
54:15 talked about but they're not one to
54:17 watch the videos you get to the end of
54:18 the answer or whatever that's fine but
54:22 as a video game person it's been in the
54:25 industry for a very very long time okay
54:28 if I had stayed in the industry since I
54:32 started I would have been in the
54:33 industry thirty years next year but I
54:38 got out of it thank God you know that
54:40 the PlayStation 10 which may never ever
54:43 exist but if it did right we're only at
54:46 four so five six seven eight nine ten
54:48 probably before ten this machine before
54:53 probably version 10 is going to portray
54:56 a reality that will be identical to ours
55:01 and quite frankly with artistic takes on
55:05 it it's going to be better than our
55:07 reality because you're going to be able
55:09 to do things you can't do in the human
55:11 form right a lot of things you saw in
55:13 the matrix it was like you just think
55:15 you can't do these things but you can
55:17 right how do we bridge this gap in
55:21 closing I'm not sure how we do it
55:25 what if we took the tack that it's like
55:28 okay we need to educate every single man
55:30 woman and child on this planet at least
55:32 the young ones how computer imagery
55:34 works so they can have a grasp of how
55:38 this works I've actually contemplated
55:40 taking you guys through a blender like
55:44 do it do an episode where I've actually
55:46 pre generated some clips where we can
55:50 take an average human being through a
55:52 product to create a rendering that is
55:56 real looking so people can see the whole
55:58 process of you know putting a cube
56:01 modifying and adding polygons stretching
56:03 things moving it around texturing it
56:05 shading it rendering it and showing some
56:09 and how these things are done and then
56:10 showing examples of these other
56:11 companies but I want to drive home today
56:14 is that this has already started
56:18 mankind is living a probably you would
56:22 you'd say all the things that NASA
56:24 claims and SpaceX and JPL and all the
56:27 space organizations and other countries
56:29 that are taking advantage of these
56:31 techniques they have us living in a
56:33 matrix our bodies aren't and totally
56:36 inside of it anything but we believe
56:38 that the images that we see that aren't
56:40 real are real and that's scary
56:45 because we're already on the gravy train
56:48 fakeness being portrayed as reality and
56:51 again you know in Hollywood we have you
56:57 know look at Charlie Chaplin using a
56:58 bunch of different amazing techniques of
57:01 tricking the camera tricking the viewer
57:03 looking at the film looking through a
57:06 camera with plates of glass with matte
57:08 paintings on them to make you believe
57:10 the things you're seeing are of high
57:13 stakes you know they paint like canyons
57:15 that don't exist and look like he's
57:17 sitting on a canyon about to fall into
57:18 it our staircase that goes down that
57:20 doesn't really exist unless you think
57:23 he's about to fall to his death but he's
57:24 not and that came all the way up to
57:27 today we're the only thing today if
57:31 Hollywood wants to get serious with the
57:32 budget and the right companies working
57:34 for them
57:35 they can simulate anything that they can
57:39 imagine anything well most the time it's
57:44 entertainment it's Pacific Rim one and
57:46 two or whatever Star Wars whatever it's
57:49 entertainment we love it we know it
57:50 we're being informed that it's
57:51 entertainment I will tell you that most
57:54 of the entertainment CG is dial back for
57:58 detail because there's a limit to amount
58:00 of budget you have in time you have to
58:02 make something look super real but a lot
58:04 of times it sneaks through and it is so
58:05 real you can't tell the difference right
58:06 I just want you to remember you only
58:10 build a fish tank to convince the fish
58:12 that they are actually in their native
58:14 world so that they don't rebel if you
58:18 want to light a man you only convince
58:20 man of what man needs to know you take a
58:22 bare minimum approach well what do they
58:24 need to see right now we're faking crap
58:27 today that a lot of people believe is
58:30 real that 20 years from now our kids our
58:33 grandkids are going to be looking at it
58:35 making videos about what we did saying
58:37 look how fake that [ __ ] is and we are
58:40 either gonna be grownups and say oh my
58:43 god you're right I didn't even put that
58:45 together yeah of course the movies were
58:46 doing this and now I was doing that same
58:48 exact thing big movie gravity versus
58:51 what they actually did in real life I
58:52 think we need to put the brakes on a
58:55 little bit of this and make sure people
58:56 understand that when you know Trump is
59:00 saying fake news for instance it's very
59:02 valuable because you know you've got you
59:04 have you know organizations faking
59:06 weather storms and faking you know
59:09 invasions and like they went on top of a
59:11 building in LA and put a bunch of palm
59:12 trees and faked that they were actually
59:14 in Desert Storm that's an old one so
59:17 they're faking all kinds of stuff but
59:18 they're just doing again the bare
59:19 minimum that convinced the eye that
59:21 these things are occurring they will
59:24 find ways to push kids into more virtual
59:26 reality every single year and thank God
59:29 the headsets died because they sucked
59:30 and but they're gonna make contact
59:32 lenses that are weighted to keep upright
59:34 HUDs perfectly they're gonna put on them
59:36 every every pair of glasses they're
59:39 going to I don't know put a chip in your
59:40 retina inside your eyeball
59:45 once they gain full control over your
59:47 input you're screwed you're screwed you
59:54 better hope that what they have to give
59:56 you is exciting you know anyway I
60:00 thought it was time to take a walk down
60:03 this because I want to heighten your
60:05 senses and I want to give you again the
60:08 chess moves right chess is gonna be the
60:11 full-on analogy of season 4 which is
60:13 most people only think one step ahead if
60:17 even a single step ahead they're
60:18 thinking about their current turn in
60:19 chess which is why they lose all the
60:21 time when their controllers are thinking
60:25 as far down that the chess board of the
60:28 chess game as they possibly can
60:30 everything that you could possibly do to
60:32 deny or accept their world they've
60:36 already thought of it the whole thing of
60:39 being a sheep being herded by either a
60:42 shepherd or a dog as their game and
60:45 they've been doing it for thousands and
60:47 thousands of years and now they have
60:49 something called computers and
60:51 computer-generated art to do this with
60:53 we got to be careful we have to listen
60:56 to our elders like Marshall McLuhan the
60:59 more a medium exists to portray our
61:02 reality the more we have to be vigilant
61:05 to say okay where am i I'm not really
61:09 here I'm a backyard or did I go to sleep
61:12 and someone put a headset on and I think
61:14 of in my backyard right anyway if you
61:18 haven't been to deep thoughts radio Calm
61:19 please go there's audio video locked
61:23 Facebook group and patreon for all of
61:25 you who support the channel I really
61:27 appreciate it any way shape or form love
61:29 the comments I've had a lot of time to
61:30 respond to comments recently just know
61:33 if you're new that's not always the case
61:34 sometimes I go 2 or 3 days before I can
61:38 respond again sometimes I'm just on my
61:40 mobile app that's all I can do is like
61:42 your comment to say I've seen you and
61:45 I'll get back to you a little bit later
61:46 so again take care of yourself and
61:50 someone else then I'll see in the next
61:51 deep thoughts over now
