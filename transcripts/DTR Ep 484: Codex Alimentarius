00:29 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:32 this tool 50 degree fahrenheit evening
00:36 who do I only wish it was 50 degrees
00:38 Celsius out here so let's see how do we
00:43 even start this one out if you've seen
00:46 the title you may not know what I'm
00:48 about to talk about and to be very
00:51 honest with you probably six months ago
00:53 I wouldn't have had any idea what I was
00:54 talking about let me ask you this
00:58 question do you think that the poison in
01:03 your food the nature of poisoned food
01:08 today
01:09 fast food produced food you know was
01:15 just a sort of serendipitous a bunch of
01:18 corporations that sort of slowly over a
01:21 hundred years just started seeing the
01:23 game they could shave a little bit off
01:25 here a little bit off there so crap as
01:30 food and so they just took advantage of
01:32 it and eventually got kind of like get
01:33 joking winked and like yeah we're all
01:35 doing this right well then if you
01:38 believe that which is quite frankly I
01:41 mean the only thing I had ever heard
01:42 prior to this subject matter was that
01:45 the Rockefeller has always said they
01:47 wanted to own everyone from cradle to
01:49 grave but then you know you're kind of
01:50 like okay so the only hospitals I'm born
01:53 in because they freaked my mom out that
01:55 she can't have a kid any other way
01:58 obviously you immediately start using
02:00 all their products the second did you're
02:02 alive you're buying your clothing from
02:03 them your food now your water and so
02:10 they can poison you slowly over time by
02:14 really making you addicted to the things
02:15 that taste good but really bad for you
02:19 from alcohol to sugar and of course that
02:24 you're going to end your life sooner
02:26 than you should because you're not
02:28 healthy they tell you all kinds of
02:32 ridiculous stories about the past where
02:34 we used to live shorter lives and stuff
02:36 yeah at times we did
02:38 but at times we lived much better life's
02:41 this is about Codex Alimentarius and
02:47 what I'm about to tell you is that after
02:50 World War two even though the engine was
02:55 started in the eugenics round way before
02:58 that at least forty years forty five
03:00 years before the end of World War two
03:04 you know they had been trying to
03:05 sterilize people and obviously not tell
03:09 them all the time that that was what was
03:10 gonna happen but after World War two was
03:13 over there was a program that was
03:17 hatched built out of some laws that were
03:22 actually decided potentially a hundred
03:27 years before that to control everything
03:33 that we consume as human beings with the
03:37 sheer intent of controlling our
03:40 lifespans
03:41 our mental aptitudes our physical
03:44 aptitudes etc etc and I just give you a
03:49 really quick sort of litmus test here
03:54 because you know I was always told that
03:57 in the mid 50's in the United States of
03:59 America a police officer had to be at
04:02 least six feet tall and you can't make a
04:06 standard like that if you don't have six
04:08 foot tall people and ample supply but as
04:12 the 70s rolled around especially the 80s
04:14 we got so malnutritioned with crappy
04:18 food that we shrunk again and now that
04:22 standards lifted why did they want you
04:24 to be six feet tall well it wasn't a
04:26 prejudice thing for tall people it was
04:29 that you needed to be big enough to
04:31 manhandle criminals of all sizes many of
04:35 which were six feet and bigger it was
04:38 part of the strategy of staying alive
04:40 for a police officer
04:43 this all starts in Germany with a
04:47 company called IG Farben and I have
04:52 tried to find the dude's name for days
04:55 and I can't find his frickin name but at
04:59 the time of world war ii the founding
05:04 member or president of IG Farben
05:07 participated in the construction and
05:11 management of the Auschwitz
05:15 concentration camp the gentleman who is
05:20 known as the genesis of bringing this
05:23 Codex Alimentarius to the United States
05:27 and essentially the first world
05:29 supposedly wrote in German over the
05:31 Auschwitz camp right when you go inside
05:32 it says through hard work comes freedom
05:35 something like that
05:37 when the war was over and all these
05:40 Germans were put under the nuremberg
05:42 trials and what have you
05:44 this guy lets all of his buddies get
05:50 massive sentences but this dude just
05:53 like Operation Paperclip were a bunch of
05:55 people that tortured people built v1 of
05:58 v2 rockets were smuggled in the United
06:00 States this dude supposedly did one day
06:04 in jail and was released because he had
06:08 something to offer his big plan was to
06:11 control food to essentially say look
06:15 we've developed a bunch of interesting
06:18 chemicals because IG farming Farben was
06:22 a chemical pharmaceutical company also
06:25 made chemical weapons i was i
06:26 understanded i guess eventually they
06:30 were bought up until now their remnants
06:32 are inside the company bare but after
06:36 the league of nations rolled over and
06:39 became the UN as we know it today he
06:42 went to them and he said look you know I
06:45 think that I've got a plan here and the
06:50 idea is very very interesting it's sort
06:53 of one of these things like
06:57 if you are a grasshopper it's these bugs
07:00 life from Pixar as a as an example and
07:04 you wanted to pounce on a big farm of
07:08 ants well you know the one thing you
07:11 can't do is go straight up to them and
07:12 say I'm gonna take you out because the
07:14 ants will eat you up to take you up but
07:17 what happens in a nightclub when a
07:18 little skinny guy wants to kind of beat
07:22 up a bigger dude hiko Cox him right
07:25 comes up beside him and Cole Coxon well
07:29 these folks do that to us all the time
07:32 any of you have ever voted for a prop
07:34 and you're in your neighborhood I don't
07:37 know what they call them in Europe but
07:38 it's the little tiny additions to your
07:40 ordinances in your local state or
07:43 province or what have you and they'll
07:45 say hey we have a a gas tax and they
07:51 wanna you know make it sounds like they
07:53 want to make a gallon of gas cost more
07:55 but here in California they made the car
07:59 registration go up and so you know it's
08:04 like hey we're gonna build a Golden Gate
08:06 Bridge and it's gonna cost X number of
08:08 cents to cross the Golden Gate Bridge
08:09 until we pay for the pay for the bridge
08:12 and then they pay for the bridge and
08:14 then the the fine the fee never goes
08:18 away and today it's something like
08:20 almost ten bucks to cross it one way and
08:22 some people live across the bridge and
08:24 work in San Francisco's they're blowing
08:25 20 bucks a day unreal right well this is
08:30 gonna be a story like that
08:32 and it's always something that is
08:38 brought to us like a wolf in sheep's
08:40 clothing
08:41 and that's what this whole thing was
08:46 presented like sort of a Robin Hood
08:48 formula but it ended up being a really
08:52 bad situation now if you think this is
08:56 just a story about America listen up
08:58 this is for every first world country on
09:00 planet Earth
09:01 and I'm not quite sure if it's
09:03 penetrated their world nations but I
09:05 wouldn't be surprised
09:07 what this dude did who got out who I
09:12 could not find his name it's probably
09:13 Farben I don't know is he he developed
09:19 an idea to try to create a trade
09:21 commission and this was that trade is
09:26 obviously associated with money and
09:29 money's associated with profit so if
09:33 someone doesn't care about this
09:35 globalist idea of controlling food but
09:38 they're like world's can you make money
09:39 doing it no he's like oh yeah hell yeah
09:41 that's like one of the instant
09:43 byproducts of this plan didn't get a lot
09:45 of people on board really really quick
09:47 so this thing incubates takes them a
09:52 little while to get things on board but
09:55 by 1962 they laid out a full plan to
10:02 control all world food including organic
10:06 food by December 31st 2009 and they
10:12 developed with this trade commission
10:17 4,000 guidelines okay which typically a
10:21 guideline is like hey yeah you should
10:23 smoke cigars you shouldn't eat too much
10:25 sugar you should exercise on everyone so
10:27 all those are guidelines
10:28 well these guidelines have become the
10:33 Codex the rules by which the street or
10:37 trade commission actually functions and
10:41 so if you don't follow the guidelines
10:43 then you can't push any food through the
10:44 Trade Commission well as this got bigger
10:48 and bigger and bigger all ooh in the
10:51 world goes through this Commission which
10:55 is gonna get a different name in just a
10:56 little bit here now it should be said
10:58 that all these guidelines that I'm going
11:01 to tell you about are not laws anywhere
11:06 in any country the only thing that's
11:09 happened is because lastik you know your
11:12 representatives to be informed about it
11:15 talk about it vote on it right now
11:19 this stuff this is what we call a treaty
11:21 you agree that you're gonna get your
11:25 supplies from this organization and thus
11:27 you adopt their rules good example okay
11:32 where you put your kid in local school
11:34 the local school decides what classes
11:37 your kids have available
11:39 well classes your kids are able to take
11:41 at a particular age or the prerequisites
11:44 do you need to buy them pencils pens
11:46 paper erasers they decide you want to
11:51 buy something from Amazon but you're
11:53 gonna adhere to all the amazon rules you
11:55 want to post something on social media
11:56 you got Twitter rules Instagram rules
11:59 Facebook rules etc there's a woman out
12:02 there her name's dr. Rima label and
12:05 she's where I'm getting a lot of this
12:08 from but you can look it up from all
12:11 different angles it's still all holds
12:13 true and it only gets more and more
12:15 intense as time goes on but these
12:17 guidelines ended up being the rules by
12:20 which all food is regulated in the world
12:24 so in 1893 and the austrian-hungarian
12:29 empire this sort of methodology of
12:34 developing guidelines to to govern a
12:38 society started to take shape from a lot
12:41 of previous experiences which we're
12:43 going to talk about which laid sort of
12:45 the bed work for what now has become the
12:48 World Health Organization and the Food
12:51 and Agriculture organizations the govern
12:56 us today the way this organization works
13:00 internally is that they will take on a
13:03 particular discipline of food and their
13:08 their spectrum within the trade
13:10 commission was anything that could be
13:12 put in the mouth except Pharma why not
13:16 farmer because this is coming from
13:19 IG Farben some brainpower he knows
13:24 pharmaceuticals because that's what he's
13:25 involved in and he definitely doesn't
13:27 want to create any rules for himself
13:29 just rules for us isn't that nice but
13:35 committees meet within this organization
13:37 and they boil it up to the point where
13:41 they get to what they call level 8 and
13:43 that means it's ready for a vote to be
13:46 ratified within this organization and
13:49 that organization is now called the
13:52 World Trade Organization WTO and that is
13:56 what you and I are under today when it
13:59 comes to all the food that we eat all
14:02 the water that we drink all the vitamins
14:05 were allowed to take and it gets scary
14:09 now the World Trade Organization
14:11 accepted the Codex Alimentarius
14:14 methodology there are 4,000 guidelines
14:17 officially in 1994 and that meant that
14:24 they're 30 some odd years of turning
14:28 this thing around just became official
14:31 so now imagine that you're a country and
14:35 you wanted the benefits of this World
14:38 Trade Organization because they started
14:39 to consume you know all the countries
14:43 that generate food and you realize that
14:48 if let's just say as an example Greece
14:51 this is made up okay say Greece didn't
14:54 necessarily want to get involved with
14:56 someone else regulating their food but
15:00 let's say Greece doesn't create all the
15:02 food that's necessary for them to feed
15:05 their people they need a little help
15:07 there once ye buy some grain from
15:09 somebody else they buy something milk
15:11 from someplace else something they don't
15:13 have in their strategic resource pool
15:15 maybe they don't have enough maybe they
15:17 don't have any and they go over to let's
15:20 say Italy and say hey you know what can
15:22 I have coming up some of your grapes
15:24 because we like wine to like grapes and
15:26 they say well you know we now comply
15:29 with this World Trade Organization so
15:31 you're gonna talk to them
15:33 we've signed an agreement with them a
15:34 treaty with them it's not really a
15:37 treaty but it's an agreement a contract
15:39 and so then Greece goes over to the
15:42 World Trade Organization and says well
15:43 you know you're not compliant or a
15:48 member of the World Trade Organization
15:49 so you're gonna have to become compliant
15:52 to join the World Trade Organization and
15:55 then once you become compliant then you
15:57 can enjoy all of the spoils of all the
15:59 countries that have signed on to this
16:02 thing
16:04 well then Greece has to do everything it
16:06 possibly can to get those 4,000
16:07 guidelines and pollute all their food
16:11 potentially to join us organization to
16:14 get any help at all with their strategic
16:16 resources ah but there's a problem for
16:19 most civilized countries because up
16:23 until the late 90s when all this thing
16:26 came all this conspiracy came together
16:29 informed the now Codex Alimentarius
16:33 World Trade Organization well you know
16:38 people be defeating their people for a
16:39 long time we've had the FDA in the CDC
16:42 and the EPA for decades and decades
16:45 prior to this World Trade Organization
16:48 it's not even formally based in the
16:50 United States so we've got laws for how
16:54 we regulate pharmaceuticals chemicals
16:57 that we can use in either biotech any
16:59 agriculture and medicines in general and
17:04 there's different ways that things are
17:08 granted to the people and we'll get to
17:13 that in just a second so in 1994 they
17:17 assumed the kotas Elementary Codex
17:20 Alimentarius and his current state but
17:23 that organization didn't continue its
17:25 power grab I mean didn't sorry didn't
17:28 cease their power grab they continued to
17:29 develop more guidelines and flying
17:32 quotes until 2013 July 4th they ratified
17:40 a brand-new set of guidelines that
17:41 controls the vitamins and minerals that
17:43 you're allowed to consume if you're
17:45 gonna get any
17:47 compliance with them in your country
17:49 this is straight-up agenda21 stuff right
17:52 remember agenda21 is the only conspiracy
17:54 in the world you need to understand
17:56 because below that is every other
17:58 conspiracy and the motive for anything
18:00 else that's happening that is not normal
18:02 in the world at a globalist level right
18:05 as of this 2009 date December 31st the
18:12 Codex ceased to be voluntary and thus
18:15 became mandatory and that changes the
18:19 whole spectrum of how this works now
18:22 also in 1994 we got an organization
18:25 called the dietary supplement health and
18:28 education act which is dasha
18:34 there's usually some type people call
18:36 that but there's something called the
18:39 Napoleonic Code which I wasn't aware of
18:41 at the beginning now America was founded
18:45 without a Democratic Party and it was
18:49 known as a republic and Republic is
18:54 absolutely standing on the foundation of
18:57 what we often call on this show and
18:59 everybody's familiar with this common
19:01 law what is common law in its most
19:04 fundamental form do no harm to others
19:07 and then we'll leave you alone it's
19:10 pretty much how it is think about that
19:12 that's the only law on the the universe
19:15 she ever needed do no harm and so when
19:19 you're writing laws about what you can
19:22 and can't do in common law it's very
19:26 very straightforward if they don't run
19:29 it right a law saying you cannot consume
19:32 something then it is legal to consume it
19:35 so for instance if there's no laws
19:38 around vitamin C consumption well then
19:40 you can eat vitamin C it's fine it's not
19:42 illegal men are under Napoleonic Code if
19:49 a law doesn't exist that says it's legal
19:51 then it's illegal and Codex Alimentarius
19:55 is based on Napoleonic Code
19:59 hence the Trade Commission is Nepali iku
20:03 hence the World Trade Organization the
20:05 World Health Organization this Food and
20:09 Agriculture Organization and this Jascha
20:12 dietary organization believes okay
20:19 because they want uh turing-complete
20:21 control that's why Napoleonic Code
20:23 exists I give you an analogy that's a
20:26 little absurd but it'll really strike
20:29 you if this isn't hitting you like a ton
20:31 of bricks already let's say there's ten
20:34 of you standing on this patio then we're
20:37 breaking it up to twelve noon and I walk
20:40 in and you guys agree that I'm your
20:43 leader and I say thank you so much for
20:47 electing me as your leader now I just
20:50 want you to know that we are now from
20:51 this point forward on a Napoleonic Code
20:55 instantaneously I have just told you
20:57 that you can't even move a muscle in
21:00 your body unless I deem it ok it's like
21:04 a military right standard attention at
21:06 ease or March turns left right all that
21:09 kind of stuff so now imagine that sort
21:11 of discipline over every single thing
21:13 that you consume as food and nutrition
21:16 and medicine and herbs and minerals and
21:21 vitamins now let's move one step into
21:25 lunacy of this program inside the Codex
21:31 they have deemed nutrients as toxins
21:36 when I was in the pharmaceutical
21:38 industry it was directly in 1994 in 1994
21:43 I drove to a pharmaceutical company
21:44 every day of my life to code this
21:46 package I'll brief you on it anymore but
21:51 I remember my boss who was not a chemist
21:55 by any stretch she was just a manager
21:57 very nice woman she spouted off one day
22:01 that vitamin C she goes well they just
22:04 figured out that vitamin C is a toxin
22:06 and I was like that's weird
22:09 and I wasn't pounding C at the time I
22:10 was very young it was about 24 years old
22:13 and sighs there okay whatever and later
22:15 when I learned about vitamin C and
22:17 realized that is absolutely not a it's
22:19 non-toxic you could take as much as you
22:23 want it just passes through your body I
22:24 mean obviously you could drive yourself
22:26 with any object in the world but within
22:29 reason thousand five thousand milligrams
22:31 ten thousand and a day you'd be fine you
22:33 won't die I wonder now if she was aware
22:37 because she's in the pharmaceutical
22:39 business and was definitely involved
22:40 with 99 percent projects I had nothing
22:43 to do with if she had heard of this
22:45 adaptation of the Codex and thus was
22:49 just repeating this phrase what is the
22:53 nature of a toxin well almost everybody
22:57 even as soon as you understand what the
22:59 word means it kind of means a we need to
23:02 protect human beings from toxins okay
23:07 well so what if you're a government
23:08 organization that believes anything is
23:11 harmful for people a cars are harmful
23:13 without seatbelts or whatever even a
23:16 seatbelt let's just say someone proposes
23:18 a seatbelt all right well we got to find
23:21 out how the things should work right
23:22 Mercedes went through hell putting a
23:23 seatbelt in a car for the first time so
23:26 you have something called risk
23:27 assessment and risk assessment starts to
23:31 get pretty insane when people without
23:33 medical degrees start to engage in
23:36 medical procedures because the world
23:38 trade organization isn't about being
23:42 super accurate with what's good for you
23:43 it's about finding out what's bad for
23:46 you and smuggling it into your food
23:48 supply so there's something called the
23:49 ld50 test and it has to do with the
23:55 amount of chemicals you can give an
23:57 animal before 50% of the animals died so
24:02 you're feeding into rats you're feeding
24:04 them to chimpanzees if it's something
24:06 super duper intense and you keep doing
24:10 it until 50% of your test animals pass
24:13 away okay at that point you have a level
24:18 of which you've been giving these
24:19 animals a particular doses of something
24:22 then the geniuses and this is this is
24:27 insane on a level that is unbelievable
24:30 because it makes no chemical sense
24:33 whatsoever they might tell you it does
24:36 but it's absolutely arbitrary and so
24:40 what they do is they take this ld50 test
24:42 let's just say for instance a rat if you
24:48 give it 50,000 you know milligrams of
24:51 vitamin c you know the creature starts
24:54 to die because it's a it doesn't have
24:57 anything else in its system and it's
24:58 like I need nutrition I need water I
25:00 need food but blah blah they divide that
25:04 dosage whatever it is they killed 50
25:07 percent of animals by 100 it's almost a
25:12 complete nonsensical arbitrary
25:14 mathematical equation and that's what
25:16 becomes healthy for a human being to
25:20 consume in terms of dosage so the other
25:24 thing that gets kind of strange
25:26 besides potentially ratcheting down what
25:29 would might be healthy for you simply
25:32 because they killed an arbitrary animal
25:33 and they're dividing it by 100 which
25:35 means your dosage can never get high
25:36 enough to get at level of nutrition
25:38 that's good for you they have deemed a
25:42 bunch of toxins okay for the human body
25:45 and the Codex Alimentarius fluoride is
25:50 good now where did they learn that hmm
25:54 well I've heard this from so many
25:58 sources that don't know each other that
26:00 for me this is uh this is factual
26:03 history which is that during the
26:06 concentration camp phase of World War
26:09 two we're not only the Jews but all
26:11 kinds of folks were held in those
26:13 concentration camps they fed them
26:14 fluoride in the water because it made
26:17 them complicit docile weak so they could
26:24 do anything to them when the air pioneer
26:27 glands were completely rotted inside the
26:30 fluoride was rotting their teeth giving
26:33 them osteoporosis
26:35 reducing birth rates and rotting the
26:39 very circuit inside your brain that
26:41 connects with your soul it gives you
26:44 life
26:44 so you just become a little bit of a
26:46 zombie right the codex also mandates
26:50 that we neutralize very healthy things
26:52 like cow milk now the worst thing about
26:57 cal milk is that it makes you fat it
27:00 just is very very fatty okay so for
27:03 instance a hundred percent milk has four
27:06 percent fat in it and that's why two
27:09 percent it's half on one percents a
27:11 quarter so I understand some people are
27:14 lactose intolerant when heavy you have
27:16 to kind of eat it to make it happen but
27:17 now imagine this if you're gonna consume
27:20 milk I will always tell you personally
27:22 for me raw milk is the way to go it's
27:25 got all the enzymes and stuff inside the
27:27 milk that it's good for me plus I grew
27:29 up in Kansas when I watch the kids out
27:32 in the country come into the city
27:35 there's a big physical difference
27:36 between the two of us I was four to
27:41 eight inches shorter than these kids and
27:43 sixth grade my friends were six feet and
27:46 sixth grade almost unanimously and
27:49 continued to grow and grow and grow and
27:52 the families were famous because their
27:54 sons were always gigantic beings
27:57 I mean monstrous by eighteen oh [ __ ] by
28:00 16 they could bill hay with a raster
28:03 hook you know I mean they would just
28:05 reach down with the 75 pound bale of hay
28:08 on the ground with the tractor going
28:10 about two miles an hour and they could
28:12 just grab a bail of hay and put it on
28:15 the back of a truck and just do this all
28:17 day long
28:18 biceps as big as your calves right our
28:21 city kids were all Johnny Depp's you
28:23 know we're like under six feet between
28:25 five ten or five eight and six feet so
28:30 one of the things that the codex
28:32 mandates is that every single cow on
28:34 earth has to be treated with the
28:36 monsanto recombinant bovine growth
28:39 hormone and guess what that cow is still
28:44 considered organic even though you get
28:47 your milk from it
28:49 interesting right thought organic was
28:52 organic Oh make again but okay like hey
28:57 I don't drink milk you don't eat meat
29:00 let's just say something like that I
29:02 don't eat red meat let's just say I do
29:06 the Codex also mandates that every
29:08 single animal used for food and traded
29:13 through the World Trade Organization has
29:15 to be treated with a subclinical
29:18 antibiotic or an hormone before it can
29:21 be allowed to be consumed by the rest of
29:24 us mmm give you another one unless the
29:32 food is being consumed raw all right
29:37 every single piece of meat has to be
29:39 irradiated before it could be sold in
29:43 the market so chicken pork anything fish
29:47 it all has to be radiated unless you're
29:50 gonna eat it raw in terms of organic the
29:55 only stipulation for using hormones on
29:59 an animal to maintain its organic
30:02 certification which includes the other
30:05 two I just told you are the two
30:06 procedures the subclinical antibiotics
30:10 and hormones the bovine hormones all
30:14 they have to do is get a veterinarian
30:16 organization to approve of the drug and
30:19 it's still organic if I told you again I
30:23 just gave this analogy in an episode
30:26 that hasn't aired yet
30:28 it's about 5g it'll go out tomorrow this
30:33 one might go to after that but I give
30:37 this example and this is because we're
30:39 on food I'm gonna give this example one
30:40 more time so if you've seen the last
30:43 three shows then you've heard this
30:45 analogy which is I get your favorite
30:47 beverage that you like in the world I
30:49 get a glass I get some Drano I get your
30:52 favorite beverage I'll let you watch
30:54 them and make the drink or pour a little
30:55 bit of Drano in the bottom and then I
30:57 pour your favorite beverage on top
30:59 alcoholic non-alcoholic doesn't matter
31:01 fizzy
31:01 flat doesn't matter and I give it to you
31:03 I hear and then I pour myself so
31:05 completely different without the Drano
31:07 and I started ringing I go and then
31:09 you're like what the [ __ ] is this like
31:11 well that's your drink what do you mean
31:14 it's got jury knowing it doesn't have
31:15 that much true you know it's just a
31:16 little bit dream and you you couldn't
31:18 it'll just go down it might you know be
31:20 a little fiery hot for a little while
31:21 maybe you'll be sick for a few weeks but
31:23 you'll be all right of course you don't
31:27 drink it
31:28 well the codex sets extremely high
31:30 limits for toxins in our food I thought
31:37 about trying to write some of these down
31:38 and tell you them I'm gonna give you a
31:40 website that you can go to to check this
31:42 out but they're all like super duper
31:45 chemical terms but they have been
31:49 permitted to give us I think over a
31:54 dozen toxins at some point it's been
31:57 almost two dozen toxins at lethal levels
32:00 meaning if we were to take a sample of
32:04 water with this much toxin and give it
32:06 to a toxicology department and go please
32:08 you know run a full spectrum animal
32:10 what's in this stuff and then check the
32:12 levels and then tell me I'll see if it
32:13 is for human beings you could get a lot
32:15 of food that's delivered by the World
32:18 Trade Organization and they would
32:20 actually say oh my god this stuff is
32:22 completely toxic where'd you get this
32:24 don't say oh the grocery store mm-hmm
32:28 great right yeah they actually have come
32:32 down to well I should say people that
32:35 are concerned about this whole thing
32:37 have identified 12 pesticides that are
32:42 allowed to be in your food that are so
32:46 toxic
32:47 there have been bans petitions to ban
32:50 these toxins worldwide it's so bad and
32:55 they categorize these under persistent
32:59 organic pollutants or pops nice so
33:04 twelve of these things were banned at
33:06 one point because they were so toxic and
33:10 then gradually over time they readmitted
33:14 nine of them
33:16 this just blows the mind man
33:18 you know we're in this era of change and
33:20 we need to to understand the enemy so
33:26 that we understand where to go to knock
33:29 all this stuff down on their list of all
33:33 these different toxins that they allow
33:35 in our food 176 of them have been banned
33:38 worldwide at some point in time because
33:40 they've been known to be so toxic and
33:42 you have to understand you know toxins
33:45 create cancer they creep birth defects I
33:48 mean there there are so many
33:52 pharmaceuticals that were created back
33:55 in the 40s I forgot the one that will
33:58 came out of Germany we're supposed to be
34:01 an antidepressant and they recommended
34:03 it to women that just had children that
34:05 were going through postpartum depression
34:07 and it was responsible for children the
34:10 tens of thousands of children in Europe
34:13 and England born with no legs born with
34:16 partial legs born with no arms but they
34:19 had the hands out of the side of their
34:21 bodies and it was a huge scandal the
34:27 pharmaceutical company that made it
34:28 never went to jail never paid any money
34:30 restitution anyone waited about 40 years
34:33 to apologize to the families but never
34:36 gave any money now these people are an
34:38 assisted-living you know with government
34:41 subsidies and all kinds of stuff so if
34:43 you think that the FDA is out for your
34:46 health I can only hope that with the new
34:48 president that we have maybe but when I
34:51 was in the industry it was just a
34:55 bribery game you know all they wanted to
34:58 know and this is the FDA's golden rule
35:02 at least in the past was that if you
35:05 went in there with clinical studies in
35:07 your rats for instance developed cancer
35:10 by massively dosing them of course right
35:13 they would ask someone in the
35:15 pharmaceutical company and someone who
35:17 was analyzing the protocols of the
35:20 clinical study results and say well do
35:24 you think that
35:27 this can go 20 years before it shows any
35:29 signs of cancer and patients and as long
35:32 as you can say someone in the room could
35:34 say yes yes we think it'll probably be
35:36 about 25-30 years before this ever gets
35:39 into a cancerous state but everybody in
35:42 the FDA just goes okay well that's good
35:44 enough go ahead and pass it and why is
35:47 that well the FDA typically gets gutted
35:51 with every presidential change because
35:53 the president appoints the lead members
35:56 of the FDA they can get the whole joint
35:59 fire everybody or they can keep some
36:02 people but the president United States
36:04 no matter who they are doesn't have the
36:07 qualifications to determine who should
36:09 be in any positions so what ends up
36:11 happening is the lobbyists from the past
36:14 at least would come up with all of the
36:16 complicit members if they liked you and
36:18 you're in the FDA you're still in the
36:20 list we think this person should stay in
36:22 this top position and anybody who has
36:25 ever rejected a drug or caused any
36:27 problems for a pharmaceutical company
36:28 they were crossed off and a lobbyist
36:31 would move out of a lobbying position
36:33 into the FDA to be a yes man or a yes
36:36 woman to push through all the drugs that
36:39 are coming it's big business right when
36:42 I was in the industry in sugar like 93
36:45 to 95 they wanted to wanted took about a
36:51 billion dollars to finish a drug a
36:54 little over a billion on average
36:57 therefore they needed to have a $1 a
37:01 dose charge to make up that money but
37:05 there was extra stipulations and this
37:08 might help your brain understand
37:09 pharmaceutical companies a little bit
37:10 back when I was in it let's say you
37:14 wanted to create a drug that grew back
37:16 hair okay you would be in a laboratory
37:20 and you'd be messing around with some
37:22 chemicals that you heard which is always
37:24 okay just so you know all these things
37:28 started off as herbs that did it
37:30 automatically so they go to China they'd
37:33 find an herb that grows hair then they
37:35 would bring it back take it
37:37 ah everyone grow some hair and that's
37:38 pretty cool you've been a whole head of
37:40 hair but it's
37:41 but you can't sell an herb because it's
37:43 organic it's a thing of nature can't
37:46 patent something that's out in the
37:47 public domain literally so what they do
37:49 is they start pulverizing this chemical
37:52 compound into a synthetic they create a
37:56 Frankenstein version of the herb then
37:59 they as soon as they get what's called
38:02 an indication they're starting to grow
38:04 hair with their synthetic on a bald rat
38:07 or something right then they're like
38:11 okay they got two choices they can
38:13 covertly hold onto that indication for a
38:17 certain amount of time but eventually
38:20 they have to tell the patent office that
38:23 they have what's called an indication
38:25 and they file for a patent with their
38:26 synthetic combination it's not
38:29 clinically ready yet it can still kill
38:31 people instantaneously still can create
38:33 birth defects and all this other stuff
38:34 but at that point they start to to
38:37 refine it the patent in 1994 was
38:40 seventeen years now the patent starts
38:43 burning before you actually got the
38:45 thing through clinical studies and able
38:46 to give it to the public so the product
38:49 I created was to speed up that process
38:51 to keep all get all the scientists on
38:53 the same page well the average approval
38:57 rate to get their clinical studies was
38:59 about ten years which means you only
39:01 have seven years of your patent left at
39:04 $1 a dose to make your money back well
39:07 those have all been extended now some of
39:09 them are biotech can get damn near forty
39:12 five years of a patent it's nuts
39:16 yeah my you know the reason why the
39:19 patent starts burning is that someone
39:21 could have a cure for instance to some
39:24 major ailment like polio or mumps
39:28 measles like a full-blown cure not a
39:29 treatment but a cure and not necessarily
39:32 a vaccination necessarily and they they
39:36 start the clock burning on you because
39:38 they don't want you to have this magical
39:40 thing but you can't figure out but
39:43 someone else could figure it out and so
39:45 they make you burn your patent out so at
39:47 least no more than 17 years whatever you
39:49 figured out if you couldn't get it
39:50 through clinical studies and there's a
39:53 bunch of stipulations that the
39:55 sorry the patent could be abandoned at
39:57 one point if you can't show you could
39:59 finish up the product and you don't get
40:00 your seventeen years and then the other
40:02 pharmaceutical company can take what you
40:03 did figure it out and get it out the
40:06 door so there's a reason why that
40:07 happens but now the patents go so long
40:11 that that's how it works just so that
40:16 you understand now the other thing is
40:18 that the World Trade Organization could
40:20 put in stipulations that you have to buy
40:22 a certain amount of food from somebody
40:24 else and if you don't take the food that
40:27 they provide you from somebody else if
40:29 they want to do that to you if they
40:31 considered a trade violation there's
40:33 fines and penalties and of course then
40:36 your relationship with the World Trade
40:37 Organization changes and maybe they stop
40:41 sending your food so this is where we
40:44 get to the more nefarious internal
40:47 planning of this organization where the
40:52 Codex when analyzed with all of its
40:55 toxic hormones and toxic toxins
40:59 pesticides that are allowed in your food
41:01 and they did a simulation against
41:05 humanity and said okay what if humanity
41:08 continues to eat all this crap what's
41:12 going to happen to humanity they realize
41:15 that just analyzing the vitamin and
41:17 mineral standards which is the lack of
41:22 the vitamins and minerals that you need
41:24 to be healthy but they were gonna kill
41:27 anywhere from three billion to one
41:29 billion through sheer starvation now we
41:32 all die okay so some of these numbers it
41:35 means that you will die a
41:37 disproportionately short you live a
41:39 disproportionately short life and then
41:41 die so that's a problem the estimated a
41:46 sheer two million would die simply of
41:50 malnutrition
41:52 I mean imagine dying of malnutrition
41:55 right there are so many ailments out
41:58 there that we call diseases that some
42:01 doctors have proven it's strictly a
42:03 malnutrition situation it's even been
42:08 I'm gonna give you a controversial thing
42:11 you can go look this up from the black
42:12 pigeon speaks channel on YouTube
42:16 he's a very mysterious guy who lives in
42:19 Canada apparently works for a television
42:21 station he's a little odd he does
42:24 promote a lot of globalist agendas more
42:27 than I he realizes about he's kind of a
42:29 negative Nancy today about the whole
42:33 world is coming to an end he's sort of
42:34 on that realm he's joined some other
42:36 channel recently but about three years
42:39 ago I saw the most remarkable video from
42:42 this guy so it would probably be about
42:44 2016 ish this is very controversial what
42:48 I'm about to say here I've even told
42:50 some my friends and they kind of liked
42:51 me kind of funny like but this dude
42:53 produced the studies produced the
42:56 results basically the clinical study
42:58 results just talking about malnutrition
43:00 here it's essentially in Europe the
43:06 exact location escapes me but he showed
43:09 the reports and the results did they
43:12 took a bunch of gay males and they had
43:17 developed this shot there was nothing
43:19 more than a bunch of nutrients and gave
43:23 gay males this shot and suddenly almost
43:28 overnight within 48 hours they became
43:33 straight for about three and a half
43:35 months and of course that's sort of
43:40 heresy in some people's courts it would
43:43 be for me it's just say if you want to
43:45 be straight and this [ __ ] works for you
43:46 then do it if you want to remain the way
43:48 you are you just do had to no bias in my
43:51 world but this was something documented
43:54 and so it starts - if this is true and
43:57 believe me he the whole video he doesn't
44:00 he never shows his face he shows all the
44:02 documentation official you know news
44:05 organizations and he doesn't lean on
44:07 anything that's really you know if he is
44:11 usually like BBC comm or you know
44:13 something that you can seek your teeth
44:17 into when it comes to claims like that
44:19 it's either it works or doesn't work
44:20 right you can't get a patent
44:22 claiming that eating jujubes is gonna
44:24 give you better eyesight you can't do it
44:26 right so nutrition is huge obviously it
44:31 makes for a healthier body in general
44:33 your eyesight for one thing rate your
44:36 bone density your muscle tissue the
44:39 acuity of your brain all that kind of
44:41 stuff right but very shortly after the
44:46 medical industry started okay because in
44:49 the 20th century the 1900s we got out of
44:54 normal eating habits globally I would
44:59 say probably third world countries kept
45:01 healthier right if they could find the
45:03 food but they very soon realized that
45:07 cancer was the byproduct of all of these
45:09 toxins being introduced into food
45:12 creating five food groups which may or
45:14 may not be healthy for you not policing
45:16 things like salt intake everything there
45:19 hardened your arteries everything that
45:20 creates plaque in your arteries they
45:24 just were like doughnuts exist holy [ __ ]
45:26 let's just eat all those hey let's just
45:28 put a bunch of butter and salt on
45:29 everything great so when you gank the
45:34 human body suppose she was sugar which
45:36 is an inflammatory meaning your blood
45:38 doesn't move around your body like it
45:39 should when you be too much sugar well
45:42 where does your immune system live it
45:44 lives in your bloodstream well just like
45:47 all the bicycle riders who do the Tour
45:49 de France they get testicular cancer
45:52 because they're sitting on a hard
45:53 leather seat which gags the arteries
45:57 that come down your butt crack and go
45:58 straight to your testicles and that's
46:00 where your immune system cleans those
46:02 babies out if you sit on you can not
46:05 only temporarily strangle that that
46:08 blood supply but you can permanently
46:10 injure it if you do this every single
46:12 day so you're really careful but they
46:15 found that that the two highest profit
46:17 margins right away then the medical
46:19 industry was the cancer and heart
46:22 disease because everything that they
46:25 gave us instantaneously started
46:27 producing these results so migrant we
46:30 only have cancer and one person in my
46:32 entire family
46:33 and she had colon cancer she was 2 of 10
46:38 people in my hometown that survived the
46:41 colostomy surgery that she had to get
46:43 the other guy he lived right across the
46:45 street from her grandmother he was an
46:46 Indian chief Native American nowadays
46:50 great guy I'm so glad he survived but
46:54 the both of them had that in common but
46:56 my grandmother started looking at her
46:57 diet and saying I introduced something
47:01 into my diet my grandmother speaking
47:03 that gave me this cancer and it was
47:06 sacrum little pink package that you find
47:09 in every restaurant to add to your tea
47:11 when I was a kid saccharin literally
47:14 said on the package known to cause
47:17 cancer now go to your local restaurant
47:21 and look at the back of the package the
47:22 cancer warning has been removed but the
47:25 as far as I know saccharin is exactly
47:27 the same chemical mixture so imagine
47:31 this aspartame also causes massive
47:34 cancer in the body okay so someone is
47:39 talking to someone else and they're both
47:41 investor class businessmen they create
47:44 opportunities and then they make a bunch
47:47 of money off of it and some do you goes
47:49 well you know we own a ton of the
47:50 medical industry yeah we do but I got a
47:52 buddy of mine over at Searles name was
47:54 Donald Rumsfeld who's that
47:56 yeah it's military boxer guy maybe some
47:58 badass dude
47:59 there's really bright guy he runs Searle
48:01 and he's gonna push through this new it
48:05 some formerly it was a heart medication
48:06 is 25 times or 22 times sweeter than
48:11 sugar he's making a sugar substitute
48:13 other stuff okay that's great what do I
48:16 care what causes cancer oh really
48:19 yeah it's really slow and so you know I
48:23 think we should put a lot of money into
48:25 John Hopkins and you know later on
48:27 they'll simulate the kernel virus in a
48:29 bit two or one now you better believe
48:32 that anyone who is of the ruling class
48:34 let's just say we won't call them the
48:36 elite they avoid all this stuff because
48:39 they have the Codex healthiness regimen
48:44 they know where all the poison food is
48:46 they know how to stay
48:47 away from it so they don't need any that
48:49 stuff and they also eat red meat just so
48:51 you know so anything that is high
48:56 nutrition in this world by nature is de
49:00 facto illegal within the Codex
49:03 Alimentarius when Clinton was in the
49:07 office he fast-tracked this whole 1994
49:10 switcheroo to the World Trade
49:12 Organization you know he was also going
49:17 Epstein Island probably rape and little
49:19 girls but over waiting for the proof on
49:23 that one but now here's the problem
49:26 anytime that a president signs up our
49:32 country to another organization like
49:35 Barack Obama who gave the Internet
49:39 control to I can I see a in in its in a
49:43 legal alliance with a foreign entity I
49:47 don't know about your country but if you
49:49 lived the United States of America this
49:51 has to be a two-thirds majority vote by
49:54 the Senate and the house in order for
49:56 this to be ratified into use by our
49:59 citizens so America's relationship with
50:03 the World Trade Organization is an
50:04 illegal alliance of Bill Clinton and
50:08 should be utterly thrown out by Donald
50:10 Trump
50:11 now there's another organization you'll
50:13 want to look up if this is interesting
50:15 to you is called a national traditional
50:17 food organization or in in in in FA the
50:22 members are Big Pharma and essentially
50:25 this giant nutrition business that's out
50:27 there today right all the supplement
50:29 companies that are making tons of money
50:30 if you know anyone who's like a personal
50:33 trainer what have you they will
50:36 depending on the person if they're
50:39 making money off of you well that's the
50:40 most healthy stuff in the entire world
50:42 and of course they always sell this the
50:45 same old scam it's not to say that these
50:48 products aren't good at times but there
50:51 is a company in the mid 90s called
50:54 Equinox no longer exists as I am going
50:57 to describe it because they got busted
50:59 by 60 minutes
51:01 but an old girlfriend of mine was
51:03 heavily involved with equinox and lost
51:06 your life to it
51:07 she lost a husband to it and she lost me
51:12 because I was single at the time and we
51:15 were gonna see if we could put something
51:16 together but this place was a cult if
51:20 there ever was one and what did they do
51:22 they sold a bunch of vitamins but now I
51:26 want you think about Alex Jones I want
51:28 you to think about anyone that's ever
51:29 tried to sell you vitamins and they
51:30 always give you the same exact story but
51:32 as far as I know Equinox was the one
51:34 that made this pitch the most popular in
51:38 the whole world
51:39 they always say that the competitors use
51:41 crappy products to make their vitamins
51:44 fillers and you know they take that
51:47 least they sell you the roots of the
51:49 plant not the plant itself so instead of
51:51 getting the mint leaf you're eating the
51:53 mint leaf branch stem all that kind of
51:56 stuff you hear that all the time and
51:58 that's how they do it that scam has been
52:01 going and going forever now what's
52:04 interesting about this and the website
52:06 which I think has changed a little bit
52:09 since the information I saw if you just
52:13 look up as separate words I'll find the
52:15 website and put it in the description
52:16 below but it was the world freedom
52:18 usa.org was the website that'll actually
52:23 really break this down but if he just
52:24 looks up look up collects Alimentarius
52:27 I'll put some videos down there so you
52:29 can see them what's interesting about
52:32 this whole thing is that there are
52:36 former military generals that have gone
52:39 on world tours talking to Europeans
52:42 talking to Americans along with dr.
52:45 LaValle
52:47 who's a woman and they've been trying to
52:51 warn people and tell them all about this
52:53 kind of stuff but one of the things of
52:55 presentations with all kinds of
52:57 scientific proofs of what I'm saying
53:00 with all those chemical names but they
53:02 actually have on the website all these
53:04 chemical names and and the dosages that
53:06 are allowed and then in the next column
53:08 over the dosages that are toxic to the
53:12 human body causing cancer and
53:14 all kinds of other problems and you'll
53:15 find out that what's allowed is way over
53:17 what is the threshold for toxicity in
53:20 the human body but just remember the
53:24 analogy with the Drano in the glass
53:27 how much toxins would you allow me to
53:29 pour in the glass of your favorite
53:31 beverage how much a drop a particle an
53:35 inch how much well the answer is always
53:38 the same
53:38 none you would let no toxins be in any
53:41 of your food if you knew it was there
53:43 but how many times when you were a
53:45 little kid you read you hear about like
53:49 that there's all these weird food
53:51 standards this is all Codex Alimentarius
53:52 right how many rat droppings are allowed
53:55 in certain food supplies right how many
53:57 worms are allowed to be ground up into
54:00 your ketchup all these horrible things
54:03 you hear them and you kind of well you
54:04 know I guess somebody can catch up on
54:06 live evil worms or herbs are nutritious
54:08 it's cool maybe they are but it's the
54:11 toxins the pesticides that are right
54:14 around this whole process genetically
54:16 modified food really what clinical
54:20 studies were done with that far as I
54:22 know none Monsanto's which was bought by
54:24 bear remember that IG Farben before that
54:30 IG farmen was noted as making I think
54:34 zyklon-b bit Monsanto's they've been a
54:39 poison company forever
54:41 they make Lysa feed right the roundup
54:44 product they're losing lawsuits left and
54:47 right which is why they sold themselves
54:48 to bear to kind of get rid of the
54:50 Monsanto neem one of my good friends did
54:54 bodyguard work for the CEO of Monsanto's
54:57 whose name I think was Robert Llewellyn
54:59 which is a totally different rub in the
55:01 wound and my buddy and he got in the car
55:05 and he was like yeah why do I need to
55:07 protect you man he just looked like some
55:08 normal guy he goes well a bunch people
55:10 want me dead
55:11 and at the time he had no idea who the
55:12 guy was or what he didn't eventually
55:14 found he was Monsanto's CEO we'd only
55:19 known you know the politicians in the
55:22 United States of America who aren't the
55:25 brightest
55:27 [Music]
55:28 they don't know anything about this they
55:31 inherit this system and believe me
55:34 anyone is part of the World Trade
55:36 Organization and who has affiliates
55:39 within the United States government the
55:41 game would be to make sure no one knows
55:43 about this but these individuals running
55:46 around the world and writing letters
55:48 into politicians or sending emails into
55:50 politicians they they have found that
55:55 when they corner a politician with an
55:57 interview or what-have-you face-to-face
55:59 and they just politely ask if they know
56:01 what this is they have no clue and so of
56:06 course when you have no clue about
56:07 something what often happens with life
56:10 you just assume it's not it's not
56:12 important yeah you've got a young person
56:16 or you and [ __ ] anyone in their 30s 40s
56:19 or 50s is patrique and diet sodas their
56:21 whole life and you go you know it's
56:22 definitely bad for you right what do you
56:24 mean I've been drinking this my whole
56:25 life I don't have any cancer yet I have
56:30 a friend of mine who died of cancer and
56:34 I kept saying you know that such bad for
56:36 you right causes cancer and the reply I
56:38 got was it hasn't caused cancer yet and
56:41 now that he's dead of cancer I don't
56:44 know what the family thinks today just
56:47 because something doesn't kill you
56:49 doesn't mean you're not suffering from
56:51 it dementia Alzheimer's amyloid plaque
56:56 in the brain okay
57:00 still don't know why it occurs it's not
57:03 hereditary as much as they tell you it's
57:05 already - I think it's hereditary about
57:08 a family with cancer a family with
57:10 autism a family with Alzheimer's is that
57:14 the toxins that they're introducing into
57:16 your food supply or perhaps during a
57:19 vaccination process your body your
57:22 genetics are weak to those toxins but
57:26 because your family has never been
57:27 exposed to them until the 20th century
57:29 you never knew about it and so they're
57:32 trying to guilt trip you for legal legal
57:35 reasons this is in your family right
57:38 meanwhile your kid took 28 vaccinations
57:40 in one
57:41 and ends up having convulsions in the
57:43 night and then is mentally impaired for
57:45 the rest of their life can't speak can't
57:47 talk or anything oh but it was in your
57:49 family don't sue us you can't sue us
57:52 who's in your family I know uh in fact
57:56 before I ever woke up I know a family
57:59 that had four daughters and I met the
58:04 youngest daughter in the software
58:06 industry in the late 80s and there was
58:10 this horrific tale this girl told me
58:12 that her mother got cancer died and her
58:14 sisters all got cancer and either they
58:16 died or they they had was a mastectomy
58:18 Zoar their breasts removed okay and
58:24 she's all just runs in our family but
58:26 the chick always drink diet coke always
58:29 and I can only assume this is a I'm
58:31 gonna stay nice and healthy with this
58:33 diet coke yeah you hear that Diet Coke
58:36 is gonna be sponsoring the cancer drive
58:37 this weekend irony man so Codex
58:43 Alimentarius the World Trade
58:45 Organization the World Health
58:46 Organization the Food and Agricultural
58:49 organization the dasha whatever they
58:53 want to call that now these are
58:56 organizations that are all underneath an
58:58 agenda 21 depopulation for profit
59:02 mechanism now imagine just just to kind
59:07 of put together the business model
59:08 you're privy to some board meeting your
59:11 fly on the wall and the board meeting
59:13 maybe you're pouring drinks for people
59:15 you don't have anything to do with these
59:16 folks but you're able to listen and they
59:21 talk about depopulating and maybe maybe
59:24 while you're listening they've got some
59:25 cases where you're like you and probably
59:27 should you know women in Venezuela have
59:29 between 7 and 15 kids and they have no
59:33 money so maybe that's probably not a
59:35 good idea right kids in Africa wife's in
59:38 Africa they just do the same exact thing
59:40 22 kids whatever they just have sex
59:43 every single time that they're not
59:45 pregnant they get pregnant and they have
59:47 a kid and you're thinking on all right
59:48 well maybe we should slow that down if
59:50 the women all educated get them a
59:51 destiny and they'll
59:54 start tapering off about two to three
59:56 kids a little bit of growth there in the
59:58 population maybe you have to you sustain
60:00 you have one you reduce you have three
60:02 you grow by one okay so you're listening
60:05 to it you know maybe maybe they need to
60:07 do something I understand why we can't
60:09 really reveal this to the public because
60:11 you don't want to take anyone's birth
60:14 rights away okay
60:15 did you keep listening and the
60:17 conversation keeps going because right
60:20 after they identified they the
60:24 philosophical desire to depopulate which
60:26 is that's all it is a philosophical
60:28 desire they want to control us all less
60:30 people easier to control right all right
60:33 just ask a school teacher with too many
60:35 kids in her class and then some squirmy
60:37 bastard it opens his briefcase and pulls
60:42 out a stack of documents it's all the
60:45 same one stapled together five or six
60:48 pages passes out to everybody now we
60:50 moved on to agenda number two of our
60:53 little plan here Oh
60:55 things just got interesting what is this
60:57 all about right and the little dude goes
61:01 this is how we're going to profit from
61:05 this depopulation why not everyone's
61:09 like oh we'll explain you know what is
61:11 your plan this is everyone's just stupid
61:13 never heard of profit from loss okay
61:16 our loss their profit they said well you
61:20 know um we're gonna be controlling the
61:22 food and we're gonna be toxifying the
61:24 living crap out of it we're also going
61:26 to be starving people of malnutrition
61:28 with malnutrition starving them of
61:30 nutrients I should say we're gonna
61:32 toxify all the meat and all the milk and
61:34 everything I mean these people will not
61:36 be able to escape and we're also got
61:39 this new control program but that's the
61:41 holes that's the another tear it's gonna
61:42 start in the 1990s okay technically
61:46 started before that but that's when it
61:47 really went full-bore right okay keep
61:52 talking he's like drooling vultures it
61:58 was gonna be like answer so I think we
62:00 need to create a big John Hopkins cancer
62:03 ward
62:04 now we'll keep the doctors in the dark
62:08 we'll definitely keep the waitress who
62:09 turned into a nurse in the dark that's
62:11 super easy they're all good people
62:13 they're gonna make everyone feel nice
62:15 and warm and comfy but there's a couple
62:17 ways we're going to inhibit the process
62:19 because someone raises their hands is
62:21 we'll want the doctors figure out what's
62:23 going wrong won't they stop this
62:25 toxicity won't they take a blood test or
62:27 whatever what the nurses realized that
62:30 they gave a kid a shot and he came in
62:31 the next day convulsing in the ER room
62:35 and then was mentally impaired oh we got
62:38 all the covered man but how do you have
62:40 that covered well we got a we got a
62:42 story
62:43 we got a technique yeah well what's the
62:46 technique well we are going to usurp all
62:52 medical education in the entire world
62:56 what does that mean well we're gonna
62:58 write all the books we've already been
63:00 infiltrating the system and anything
63:03 that would lead a doctor do you think
63:06 for themselves we'll be crushed with a
63:09 couple different techniques well you
63:12 know becoming a doctor means you're
63:13 gonna have to memorize a lot of stuff
63:14 right well we're going to change the
63:18 requirements of graduation each year
63:21 that these poor kids are trying to
63:23 become doctors we're gonna so overwhelm
63:25 them that in their 10 years to become a
63:29 doctor we're going to stuff 15 years
63:31 where the information down their throat
63:33 and so only the elite kids that could
63:37 memorize the other five years within a
63:39 ten year period are gonna have any hope
63:41 at all and so we won't allow them to
63:46 roam around the universe doing
63:48 laboratory experiments or anything with
63:51 what we teach them they're simply going
63:52 to be forced to take our word for it or
63:56 they will graduate well then we're gonna
63:59 put them in an internship underneath
64:02 another underneath another doctor that
64:04 already has completed this
64:05 indoctrination system and you know
64:10 they're gonna learn all these pharma
64:11 tables too you know you got a headache
64:14 and sweats well that's ibuprofen boom
64:16 right and so
64:18 they're also gonna get really rich with
64:21 what they know whatever little they can
64:23 manage to remember and put it into
64:25 practice I'm gonna make so much money
64:28 that they will not worry about anything
64:32 but at the same time we're gonna put a
64:35 control mechanism in which is we're
64:36 going to allow malpractice lawsuits
64:39 because these people are gonna be
64:40 hurting a lot of people because they
64:41 don't know what the [ __ ] they're doing
64:43 but the malpractice insurance is gonna
64:46 keep them on their toes
64:48 because anyone screw up they do from our
64:50 protocol which is certified to be good
64:53 you go into court the protocol you win
64:55 you do something outrageous to try and
64:57 help someone and they die with any
65:00 malpractice will punish them we're
65:03 moving outside the envelope you know
65:05 someone says brilliant and they open out
65:09 what is the Seagrams or something now
65:12 what's the story part of the game well
65:15 everything needs a spin doesn't it so in
65:18 the off chance that something starts to
65:21 reveal itself one will start immediately
65:25 changing the medical books to make sure
65:27 that we by technique sort of create a
65:30 blind spot for everyone but we're gonna
65:33 buy the press we're gonna pay the
65:35 attorneys to concoct a perfect way for
65:39 us to avoid all legal liability the
65:42 number one name of the game is it's in
65:44 your bloodline that's going to address
65:46 probably 95 to 98% of all risks that we
65:50 might assume by teaching doctors the
65:52 wrong thing but we also own all these
65:56 sort of scientific rags out there like
65:59 Scientific American popular science all
66:01 those things Time magazine we own them
66:03 all man and so throughout the course of
66:08 time we are going to infiltrate
66:11 everyone's understanding of the human
66:12 body and so when someone comes home and
66:16 is getting a prescription for
66:18 chemotherapy well everyone's gonna say
66:20 that's the right thing to do because
66:22 that's the only thing that fights cancer
66:25 doesn't matter that we kill about 93% of
66:28 the patients with chemotherapy has it
66:31 been innovated since 1980
66:32 all right but everyone's gonna feel
66:35 comfortable with their death serum to
66:38 fight the cancer that we gave them when
66:42 I did my episode on Big Pharma which you
66:45 should see which is way back I think in
66:48 season one I told you an analogy which
66:51 you need to remember and it's what you
66:54 can use to easily explain this to
66:57 another human being if I said to you hey
67:00 would you trust McDonald's with your
67:03 overall health you know the health of
67:07 your brain the health of your digestive
67:09 system your bones your skin would you
67:12 trust McDonald's eat there every single
67:15 day would you trust their executives on
67:18 the board of directors to make sure that
67:21 what you're eating is good for you any
67:24 sentient human being on earth what
67:25 immediately knee-jerk and say hell no
67:27 okay
67:30 well why is that why don't you trust me
67:32 dumb well geez they're all private
67:34 for-profit they don't care about my
67:37 health they're just trying to sell me a
67:38 crappy burger with grade Z beef so yeah
67:42 you're learning this is awesome you're
67:44 totally awake now what makes you think
67:47 that John Hopkins cares about your life
67:51 what makes you think that any
67:52 pharmaceutical company you can name on
67:54 planet Earth cares about your life how
67:59 much money does McDonald's make how much
68:01 money does a pharmaceutical company make
68:04 mm-hmm John Hopkins if you get hungry
68:09 and you go to McDonald's how much money
68:11 do your part was to fill up your stomach
68:13 12 bucks if you get the deluxe son
68:16 version right how much money do you lose
68:19 per month taking chemotherapy I'll tell
68:23 you thirty thousand dollars a month if
68:26 you're lucky it's important to remember
68:29 that before Donald Trump became the
68:31 president United States we had something
68:33 called inheritance tax and this relates
68:35 right back to pharmaceuticals and health
68:38 industry guess it's all owned by the
68:40 same people when you really go up up up
68:42 up up it's the same people own the place
68:46 Donald Trump realized the game of the
68:49 inheritance tax again you can keep ten
68:51 million dollars of your parents money if
68:53 they're rich tax-free inheritance boom
68:57 all right considering you're dividing it
68:59 up usually among a few children that no
69:02 one really gets the 10 million typically
69:04 but anything over 10 million the
69:06 government used to take in the United
69:08 States of America I don't know about
69:09 your country if you don't live here
69:11 50% of your money 50% of your family's
69:16 wealth gets just stolen because your
69:20 family member died which is why most
69:22 family members create trusts they move
69:25 the money into real estate all that kind
69:27 of stuff so they don't get nabbed Donald
69:31 Trump just got rid of it
69:32 then some people could get cynical
69:34 because he's rich no because he
69:35 understands why the inheritance tax was
69:38 created it was created so that you never
69:41 amassed enough wealth to compete with
69:43 them the ones that own the
69:45 pharmaceutical industry the ones own the
69:47 food industry the ones that are behind
69:48 Codex Alimentarius you're never to get
69:52 more powerful than them all right I
69:55 almost go back over the health industry
69:56 with that analogy in my family alone I
70:03 would say through marriage not through
70:06 genetics most of the women who lost
70:12 their husbands eventually and died
70:14 somewhere between 80 and 100 they had
70:19 about a hundred and fifty to two hundred
70:21 thousand dollars in the bank by the time
70:24 they needed to use that money to survive
70:26 in a hospice situation or at least an
70:29 assisted living situation last number I
70:32 had was that in 2004 a family member of
70:36 mine through marriage had to be admitted
70:40 to assisted living and obviously
70:42 eventually in the last few years of her
70:44 life hospice but just assisted living
70:48 this woman was able to walk dress
70:50 herself no problem she just couldn't
70:53 quite take care of all the faculties to
70:55 keep herself well fed all day long and
70:57 that kind of thing
70:59 we houst her in Texas just outside of
71:03 Dallas her monthly bill was $24,000 a
71:09 month nothing special
71:12 wasn't bad wasn't like a rockefeller you
71:15 know Club Med but they start the
71:19 draining process as quickly as possible
71:21 and that's if you're healthy my friends
71:25 that have died of cancer oh my god well
71:28 you know how their insurance companies
71:29 work they got little clauses in there we
71:31 just start dying a cancer we'll cover
71:33 you for a couple of months but if you
71:34 can't totally cure cancer in a couple
71:37 months well then we're just gonna dump
71:38 your policy well I start paying 5% or
71:42 10% and you're stuck with hundreds of
71:44 thousands of dollars worth of bills they
71:47 bleed you dry that's why they love this
71:50 whole game do you think these people
71:53 want to fix this problem
71:55 hell no politicians that are aware of
71:58 what's going on you don't think that
72:00 they have a couple summer homes they
72:02 were gifted to them that Bugatti that
72:05 Lamborghini the trip somewhere some
72:08 other guarantees some other way you know
72:10 when you get out of that Senate job come
72:14 over to us you can be a lobbyist I'll
72:17 pay you three times as much as you're
72:19 making as a senator but we want to roll
72:21 the decks and we want you to go in there
72:22 and effect change so that benefits us if
72:25 you can't do that you're out that's why
72:28 when Trump came in he put a moratorium
72:30 on lobbyists again the more you
72:34 understand about the world the more that
72:35 dude looks like [ __ ] Superman which
72:38 is why everyone regardless of their
72:40 affiliation in the world supports this
72:43 man who understands agenda 21 and Codex
72:46 Alimentarius but we got a lot of work to
72:49 do in the 21st century before we're safe
72:52 the dive on this subject matter can get
72:55 deep the videos I have not found any
72:58 video worthwhile that is in at least an
73:00 hour long in most cases you know this is
73:05 your health regardless of how old you
73:07 are
73:09 is the health of your children and the
73:11 legacy of your entire family lying
73:14 if this goes unchecked and continues
73:17 going in the direction that's going it's
73:19 only gonna get worse right remember they
73:23 brought back what seven of the no nine
73:26 of the twelve toxins all lethal levels
73:31 okay
73:32 well you don't think that there's a
73:34 committee meeting like once a year at
73:36 least that says how are we gonna get the
73:38 rest of the hundred and seventy six that
73:40 were banned worldwide back on the list
73:43 the second that a deep state shill
73:46 becomes your president becomes your
73:48 representatives prime minister your
73:50 chants or whatever the stuff just goes
73:52 through like a goose man [ __ ] through
73:54 goose it's SuperDuper fast well the
73:58 food's gonna look the same it's gonna
74:00 look the same
74:02 how many of us have a garden in our
74:04 backyard that we grow everything that we
74:07 eat if you like meat are you gonna
74:10 handle that you're gonna have to find
74:12 some farmer out there who refuses to
74:17 sell his meat to the World Trade
74:19 Organization which you can't really
74:21 exist with a big pasture and meat unless
74:25 you do that right then he keeps a little
74:28 herd off to the side there's a little
74:30 wink-wink nudge-nudge agreement you have
74:32 with that do to give you the fresh beef
74:33 fresh chicken fresh turkey whatever
74:36 you'd like to eat now it's kind of cool
74:40 and I know that this isn't the case some
74:45 of these rules are definitely skirted
74:49 locally where I live is that there's a
74:52 lot of fish restaurants around here and
74:56 in fact one of them I was involved with
74:59 his restaurant and a redesign that he
75:02 did through another friend of mine and
75:05 this dude catches his fish from the
75:09 ocean every single day and slaughters it
75:12 at the dock and then brings all the cuts
75:16 into his restaurants and they're not
75:17 irradiated a lot of it is raw like
75:23 pokey sushi all that kind of stuff as
75:27 long as you're not eating bluefin tuna
75:29 you're gonna be alright yellowfin tuna
75:31 and you can have some yellowtail and
75:34 you'll be alright
75:36 it's just as delicious so why not so if
75:40 you are working with folks in your local
75:42 area that claim things are organic you
75:45 may look you may want to go look up the
75:47 what is allowed and then ask them okay
75:50 are using a veterinarian certified
75:52 hormones
75:52 Janine's certified this or that there's
75:55 subclinical hormones and antibiotics and
75:59 that kind of stuff you might want to ask
76:03 this is another layer another wing on
76:06 the house of agenda21 which has also
76:10 been renamed agenda 2030 so you're gonna
76:14 see this episode in the midst of if you
76:16 catch it when it releases in the midst
76:18 of this coronal virus thing that's going
76:20 around the world right now at least the
76:22 movement that is that ordered that whole
76:24 thing did you ever believe in your
76:27 lifetime that you would be on planet
76:30 earth whereby countries that aren't
76:34 involved with the world banking system
76:35 barely have any cases and the countries
76:37 that are getting fiat currency from
76:39 these world bankers are having these
76:41 super up at pandemics excuse me and
76:45 we're all locked you know technically
76:47 spiritually we're supposed to be in our
76:49 house we're supposed to be self
76:51 quarantine sheltered in all this kind of
76:54 stuff I mean you realize that geez I
76:57 think about 90% of my friends are not
77:00 allowed by law at this point to go to
77:01 work all right how long is that gonna
77:04 last where no one has any money but you
77:07 know landlords expect rent banks expect
77:10 payments on cars and whatever unless you
77:13 have to eat you know so if you think
77:16 that this stuff isn't true or you think
77:19 this stuff is being oversold by me I
77:21 guarantee you you do your research and
77:24 you will find that I brought this to you
77:25 and one of the most calm states of mind
77:28 that you will ever see anyone present
77:30 this information to you the truth of the
77:32 matter is that it is much more severe
77:34 and immediate and you
77:36 inside this envelope with me depending
77:38 on how old you are
77:39 imagine you were born in 1994 then
77:43 you've been inside this your whole life
77:45 my kid has been inside this envelope her
77:47 whole life and I didn't even know until
77:49 recently so if you know anything else
77:52 about this you have other links or
77:54 whatever please put all that in the
77:56 description down below but you do owe it
78:00 to yourself to get informed about this
78:02 such that when the subject comes up you
78:04 have the facts and you probably should
78:07 look at not only their current policies
78:11 and intention but look up those that are
78:14 fighting for this truth because
78:17 unfortunately the voices that are most
78:20 prominent like dr. label and there's a
78:24 some military general guy who's also out
78:29 there doing it he might be passed by now
78:31 but I'm not sure but got there and look
78:33 because the folks that are aware of this
78:36 are aging and there's only so much they
78:41 can do now you'll find that older people
78:44 believe that you can write a letter or
78:45 send an email and it's gonna effect
78:47 change because of some algorithm where
78:49 one email is associated with 13,000
78:51 people with the same feelings and so the
78:55 old boomer strategy of fixing these kind
78:59 of problems is to give a politician the
79:01 fear of non re-election I can assure you
79:04 that everything I've seen online
79:08 there ain't nobody on the hill worried
79:10 about being non elected because of Codex
79:12 Alimentarius knowledge they simply
79:15 aren't the only way this is going to
79:19 start to affect their nervous system in
79:22 terms of being reelected would be if the
79:24 keyword for this starts to trend it
79:28 starts to become a viral thing that
79:30 people understand but think about what I
79:32 just explained was it easy to understand
79:34 maybe but it's it's it's tough it's
79:40 tough and if the other thing to remember
79:43 out of all of this is that our
79:45 association with the WTO
79:48 is potentially illegal because no one
79:51 voted on it and that little thread in
79:55 the sweater could be pulled pretty
79:57 intently to unravel a bunch of other
80:01 organizations that we are complicit two
80:03 of which our legal system has not
80:05 ratified properly / legally so you might
80:10 want to check your own country as to
80:11 when they adopted it but I would say if
80:14 you're in the European Union you
80:16 probably are absolutely ratified into
80:18 this because that's where all the money
80:21 goes goes into the World Bank the IMF it
80:25 serves the World Bank and I'm sure that
80:27 they're completely 100% now if you're in
80:29 Britain maybe not
80:31 Ireland Scotland don't know where your
80:33 laws go cuz I know Britain decides
80:35 things and you do it and I don't know
80:36 how that works
80:38 Australia New Zealand not sure but it's
80:42 something to check out so anyway again
80:46 post anything you know in the comments
80:48 below
80:48 and if you have not been to deep
80:50 thoughts radio Calm please go give you
80:52 the short bumper today lots of links
80:54 down below to all these sources so
80:57 definitely get down there if you just
80:58 want to quickly go over there but we
81:01 have at least two reliable video sources
81:03 with all the videos we have two reliable
81:06 sources for all platforms for audio
81:09 podcasting we have for social media we
81:13 have a lakh Facebook group with some of
81:14 the coolest people employment earth you
81:16 need to get in there and become a member
81:18 it's locked so no one gets to see what
81:20 you discuss it's your private little
81:22 world you also have a couple ways to
81:25 donate to the show PayPal and variety on
81:27 break down kitchen the credits forever
81:28 gets the videos like these the numbered
81:30 videos before everyone else typically as
81:33 well as the 20% discount on the store
81:35 the store has two designs in it right
81:36 now for season five those will disappear
81:40 after the season is over so to get this
81:42 late it's too late to get those shirts
81:45 season 1 has been completely remastered
81:47 is on a completely different Channel
81:49 we're starting to get some fare
81:50 subscription counts over there so if you
81:54 want to see how the show started its I
81:57 think it's a fun archaeological dig most
81:59 of the videos at least 51% of the video
82:02 in season one or for you for
82:04 self-improvement to make you more
82:05 powerful as a human being so it's my
82:07 version of like a Tony Robbins course
82:09 with hardcore analysis of all things so
82:14 get over there and take a look but other
82:16 than that take care of yourself and
82:18 someone else and I will see you in the
82:20 next deep thoughts over now
