00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:32 gentlemen today I thought we'd talk
00:34 about this little catchphrase is going
00:37 around called canceled culture I almost
00:40 want to call it cancer culture maybe
00:43 I'll get all clever with it so what is
00:47 that for those of you who haven't been
00:49 around and polluted your brain with
00:51 tmz.com
00:54 cancer culture is all about the soda
00:59 you're probably rooted in your
01:01 Millennials I'm not sure the Zoomers are
01:05 into it probably a decent amount of Gen
01:07 Xers trying to feel righteous and
01:09 probably not much of the Zoomer or the
01:12 boomers excuse me but they dig into who
01:17 you are as a human being because the de
01:20 facto hate themselves this is the key
01:22 behind anyone that's supporting cancer
01:24 called cancer culture there you go the
01:28 canceled culture they hate themselves
01:32 100% and so because they hate themselves
01:37 the only way they can divert away from
01:39 looking at the mirror is to go outside
01:42 and find someone else the hate the
01:46 Kenneth Burke scapegoat theory is in
01:49 full effect
01:51 hey I don't like my government so my
01:53 government should give me everything for
01:55 free you know I don't like myself so
01:58 let's see how many other people we can
01:59 hate and so in picking people that they
02:03 hate there's two different methods it's
02:04 one they'll use indoctrination maybe
02:08 they're a big patron of the view on TV
02:11 and they tell them who you're supposed
02:12 to hate all right just watch CNN orny
02:15 this news is fake news which is
02:16 generally all of it and they'll tell you
02:19 who to hate and so you have a bunch of
02:21 pre-qualified targets you know it's like
02:23 used cars or something right but then
02:26 there's the second technique which again
02:30 the entire mechanism is based on being
02:34 triggered which is another modern
02:36 version of
02:37 of what you call being offended being
02:40 offended is a fake emotion what is
02:43 really going on is you're getting angry
02:44 and you get angry up to one point you do
02:47 one thing maybe you walk away but then
02:50 you get mega angry and then maybe you
02:51 take action okay
02:55 probably it's oddly warm today I can't
02:57 even believe this I got all bundled up
02:58 because yesterday I was seeing my breath
03:00 when I did an episode and now I'm feel
03:04 like I overdid it funny so what's
03:09 interesting is is this is getting so bad
03:11 that it's actually interfering with the
03:13 entertainment industry that is still a
03:15 decent area of the entertainment
03:18 industry Dave Chappelle and bill burr
03:21 have both had a comedy special on
03:23 Netflix in the last year here in 2019
03:25 and in their first act of their bit both
03:29 of them took time out to engage in this
03:33 canceled culture identification you know
03:37 basically saying you know Dave Chappelle
03:38 did an amazing job turning it on the
03:41 audience bill bird just talked about I
03:45 think he was in England at the time I
03:47 couldn't tell if he was in England if
03:48 he's in Australia I think he's in
03:50 England I think every time he tried to
03:52 do a British accent he managed to do a
03:55 fairly decent Australian accident so
03:56 that's why I couldn't figure out where
03:57 the hell he was but he they're telling
04:00 the audience look you're screwing
04:02 everything up but now I'm seeing it in a
04:03 lot of different shows that you know
04:05 talk shows that are more interesting
04:12 there's a guy on Fox and has that show
04:14 Greg something or other GG is his logo a
04:20 pretty funny guy you had a really great
04:22 panel two floaters and two staples but a
04:30 long time ago I did an episode on
04:31 political reckless and I did another one
04:35 on being offended and you know when you
04:37 see and hear things like that I did this
04:40 you know I take time out of my life I
04:42 put this thing together put it out there
04:43 and I imagine that most people listen to
04:46 it they're like you know I'm preaching
04:48 to the choir
04:48 some people will listen to that
04:51 and other people in other parts of the
04:52 world talking about it and they just
04:54 sort of go well you know whatever but it
04:57 what can you do you know and what I want
05:01 to press upon you to maybe repeat to
05:04 other people is the question of this do
05:10 you know what you get when you blow off
05:13 your need to participate in society to
05:16 get rid of political correctness you get
05:20 canceled culture you get this triggered
05:25 BS and if you were to plot it on a graph
05:29 and let's just say you know the top of
05:35 the graph is freedom and the bottom of
05:38 the graph is tyranny and we're going to
05:40 do a line graph over time the more the
05:45 political correctness is allowed to
05:47 continue freedom goes down in the stock
05:50 market the more that you let this
05:53 triggered society continue it goes down
05:57 and what's really sad about it is it is
06:01 an overwhelming minority of people that
06:03 are doing this triggered cancel culture
06:07 [ __ ] but they are so persistent and
06:10 the networks are such I don't know
06:12 docile individuals that have no
06:15 backbones they're letting you know the
06:18 the key to fail and a company is to let
06:21 marketing tell the company what to do it
06:24 was never ever intended to do that
06:27 some genius somewhere invent something
06:30 marketing is merely tasked with getting
06:34 the information out about the product
06:36 you know there's some funny mighty
06:38 Python skits about selling short pieces
06:42 of string and they did a great bit to
06:45 say ok if you've got a horrible product
06:46 that nobody actually wants then the
06:48 marketing department can help you sell
06:50 something that is otherwise ridiculous
06:53 but in most cases Steve Jobs and company
06:57 create awesome hardware and marketing
07:01 goes off and hire shied a and they
07:04 create the most
07:05 amazing iPod campaign marketing can't
07:09 tell a vodka company how to make vodka
07:13 but they can tell the world that the
07:15 vodka exists and maybe do some market
07:18 research and someone says alia the
07:20 competition's made a raspberry vodka I
07:22 don't know if you guys can do that we
07:24 can't tell you how to do that but if you
07:26 did make raspberry vodka
07:28 I can I can sell it I'd probably be the
07:31 maximum amount of participation that
07:33 should occur in this particular
07:34 situation before we go too much further
07:37 down this line I mean it is my direct
07:39 hope the people get so disgusted with
07:43 this cancel culture horseshit that we
07:48 have a Renaissance of freedom of speech
07:53 of true art and we take these kids that
07:59 have you know lined up in a protest and
08:01 we just theoretically culturally mow
08:05 them down with tanks of art and freedom
08:09 of speech just flatten them right out
08:11 you're done your little rant of
08:15 screaming and yelling in the restaurant
08:17 you know if you've you've had kids that
08:19 have ever had an issue if your kid
08:23 screams and yells at home they usually
08:25 get a whack on their diaper if they
08:27 scream and yell in the restaurant or the
08:30 department store you don't to be seen
08:32 doing that so you get your stuff paid
08:34 for you get your kid out get them home
08:36 and then you smack their diaper you know
08:38 it's one of those sorts of things right
08:40 but we have these people disrupting
08:45 society disrupting industries that are
08:50 otherwise completely functional imagine
08:55 if these scumbags existed even 30 years
09:00 ago let's say 1990 all the way back to
09:05 say 1970 think about all of the amazing
09:10 creations out there that we would have
09:14 lost that would have never been able to
09:15 exist
09:16 because someone would have come after
09:18 Mel Brooks who knows the thing is
09:24 there's no limit to this right they
09:26 could be coming after Steven Spielberg
09:28 George Lucas they could come after
09:31 anybody and the irony of the whole thing
09:35 is is that this is the same kind of
09:37 folks I mean the exact folks that talk
09:42 about bullying right they virtually
09:46 signal every step of the way they create
09:50 a LinkedIn calm account not to find a
09:52 job not to post anything you know
09:55 informative they go up there to spill
09:58 over their hatred from this twitter.com
10:01 which is nothing more than the most
10:03 acidic dark pool of hatred that entire
10:09 platform is people hating each other
10:12 that's the whole platform Facebook well
10:17 you still get at least a I would almost
10:20 estimate a 51% of the people at least
10:22 are trying to show off with their lives
10:25 they're trying to pass around positivity
10:27 in where the regardless if it's real or
10:30 not at least that's good intentions
10:32 maybe it's part of the law of attraction
10:35 Instagram hey man it's just pictures and
10:38 maybe showing off a little bit you know
10:41 if you really think about you know
10:44 conflicting concepts coming together and
10:48 there's you know a lot of analogies in
10:51 the physical world you might have to you
10:55 know surface plates on the surface of
10:58 the earth banging into each other and
11:01 while they're banging into each other
11:03 you have risk weights and you have all
11:05 kinds of crazy you know things happening
11:08 on the surface that aren't good for the
11:10 people on at the top but eventually it
11:13 all comes down any other Rocky Mountains
11:16 that then you worship because they're
11:19 colossal and they're huge that it's like
11:21 Mount Everest where you're up there
11:24 climbing it because it's so high it
11:26 becomes a different thing
11:29 there are obviously you know there's
11:32 like crater lake crater lake was the
11:34 result of a gigantic volcano that
11:36 erupted but now it's got a lake in it
11:37 you know so the analogy there is that
11:42 this canceled culture is forbidding
11:45 growth from occurring it's forbidding us
11:50 from bringing two different thought
11:52 processes together and letting it
11:53 organically work out because everyone is
11:56 trying to get so triggered that it
12:01 evolution just stops it just stops you
12:06 know for those who've heard every show I
12:08 will sound a bit like a broken record
12:09 with this example but this is important
12:13 to me every single time I think about
12:17 two cultures trying to come together and
12:19 there are some cultures that will never
12:21 blend together right Sharia law can go
12:24 [ __ ] itself right I mean that is like
12:25 the most barbaric [ __ ] ancient way of
12:29 thinking that Arabs should want to
12:32 utterly scorch the earth where Sharia
12:36 law exists they should it is the most
12:38 embarrassing
12:40 caveman method of existing on this
12:43 planet that's the truth and it's funny
12:47 that all the other methods of living
12:49 together on earth work where you could
12:51 put a Hindu next to a Buddhist next to a
12:54 Christian you know that coexistence
12:56 bumper sticker works well but you can't
12:59 have Sharia law somewhere in the middle
13:01 that sticker but the elite love it
13:04 because they're they're Satanists they
13:08 you know they'd love to see people die
13:11 and things burn it's so surreal I was
13:14 just a literally an orgasmic plot for
13:17 Humanity they just get to sit there and
13:20 watch oh my god that guy shot his wife
13:21 like as he was done being married to her
13:24 okay cool
13:25 what's next oh he's gonna rape that
13:26 little girl oh cool let's watch that
13:28 Epstein Branson Richard Pryor for me it
13:35 was one of the most masterful conductors
13:40 of
13:41 cultural tolerance that I have ever seen
13:45 in my life and I keep trying to think if
13:48 there's anyone else like that and I will
13:51 definitely say of course there are
13:52 comedians that drop humour a bit like he
13:55 used to write it but Richard would get
13:57 on stage in his whole bit for an hour
14:00 plus was all about being able to laugh
14:04 at each other you know he would make fun
14:07 of his his own culture the black culture
14:11 he grew up in but he he would I mean you
14:14 have to see Richard Pryor live on Long
14:18 Beach because where it is it is red top
14:22 black slacks medium fro I think it's
14:27 like 76 or something like that when it
14:29 was recorded somewhere in there 76 78
14:33 some in there I grew up with this
14:35 special which is why it brings so true
14:38 to me so here I am just as soon as the
14:40 thing got to videotape my dad had it and
14:45 it wasn't uncommon for us to play it you
14:47 know once a week probably twice a month
14:51 and then once a quarter and then once
14:54 every half year just watching it and
14:57 watching it and watching it you know my
15:00 father would imitate parts of the
15:02 routine until I started doing part of
15:05 the routine and just I mean we just had
15:07 a call two weeks ago and I dropped one
15:10 of the lines on him randomly and just
15:13 got him dying laughing you know but one
15:16 of the first scenes in this this bit is
15:19 that he's he comes out on stage and he's
15:21 like I can see what's going on in the
15:24 crowd and he goes I can see these the
15:26 white folks that they came late finding
15:29 black folks in their seats because they
15:32 just you know they acted like they
15:34 didn't they didn't cherish the moment of
15:35 coming to see Richard Pryor they thought
15:37 they could come in at the last second in
15:39 those [ __ ] that come in to the movie
15:40 theatre when the credits are rolling
15:41 because just they just can't get in
15:44 there on time sort of thing and then he
15:46 does this impersonation of a white guy
15:48 trying to tell a black guy to get out of
15:51 his seat and it's just hilarious and
15:53 eventually
15:55 pushes back and then the white guy caves
15:57 and then the guy's like hey I don't know
15:59 you but here's my wife you know it's
16:02 hilarious and it was the antithesis of
16:05 this canceled culture I try to say that
16:11 keeps saying cancer culture and what's
16:15 really contradictory about this entire
16:18 situation is that you have these
16:20 extremists which are your super mega far
16:24 left us right and they are on one end
16:28 teaching people the divide right black
16:33 lives matter comes out of absolutely
16:34 thin air and of course there are always
16:37 bad things happening to everyone around
16:39 the world in different pockets here and
16:41 there and so they messed with a bunch of
16:45 statistics and made it look like white
16:49 cops so the only reason why anyone dies
16:51 in this world okay into someone's has
16:54 done a beautiful job re-educating all
16:57 the ghettos that it's actually
16:59 unfortunately a lot of black on black
17:02 crime now nobody should be killing
17:04 anybody okay no one's trying to make two
17:06 wrongs are right by any means right but
17:10 that exacerbates this this thing they
17:13 have white people hating themselves
17:14 these this whole white privilege thing
17:18 all right you know the this notion that
17:22 you can get rid of privilege and somehow
17:27 just have a wonderful world everybody is
17:29 without privilege and you want to live
17:32 in that world
17:34 okay well then how you gonna make a
17:36 movie I'm gonna make an album how are
17:39 you gonna invent the next car the next
17:42 television I mean maybe we don't need
17:44 some of that stuff but you have to have
17:47 people in privileged situations
17:51 irrespective of their race in order to
17:53 make certain things occur
17:55 you know Isaac Newton invented calculus
17:57 by the age of 19 okay I guess the guy
18:01 didn't have to pay any bills while he
18:03 was doing that yeah you weren't
18:06 considered
18:08 a child at 18 like you are today in his
18:12 world you should start working probably
18:14 around the age of 10 to 12 just out
18:17 bringing in some money and again you
18:20 know all of these metrics that people
18:23 try to throw down to say you have
18:25 privilege and therefore I have the right
18:27 to hate you okay so you get rid of every
18:31 white person on planet earth the problem
18:34 is is you're talking about a mental
18:36 illness that is being propagated as some
18:39 social imperative so you have a family
18:44 you've got some brothers and sisters
18:45 you're not out of school yet so used to
18:47 live at home I can assure you that if
18:50 you have two siblings of the same sex
18:55 one of you is a lot more pretty than the
18:59 other one one of you might be of a more
19:03 acceptable shape according to society on
19:06 that particular day and the other one
19:08 might be considered obese
19:11 now what you know other people to hate
19:15 all the white people are gone so now you
19:17 get to hate your sister because she's
19:19 pretty or eight your sister because
19:21 she's obese or vice versa our
19:23 brother-sister whatever I think most
19:26 people are starting to wake up now when
19:28 you have this I don't know what greta's
19:31 mental problems are but it's pretty
19:34 clear I mean I think she's they say she
19:35 has Asperger's this kid looks like the
19:39 kind of child that would be the result
19:41 of being an MK ULTRA mental institution
19:45 pretty much up until the day they
19:47 exhibition her mental condition around
19:49 as some activist oh okay
19:54 so you'd literally search the entire
19:57 planet instead of finding other
19:58 prodigies you find kids that have mental
20:02 problems and you parade them around the
20:06 world as if for any reason they have any
20:08 level of authority on anything when they
20:11 can't control their own brain to operate
20:13 properly so there's something [ __ ] up
20:17 about that there really is
20:20 it's morally irresponsible to parade a
20:23 child around like that and especially
20:26 let's just say she's legit I think she's
20:28 one of the worst actresses on planet
20:30 earth but let's say she's legitimately
20:32 having her child destroyed by all of us
20:35 normal thinking people okay so someone
20:42 is now telling a child with mental
20:45 problems okay I would say she is in the
20:49 category of mental retardation in that
20:52 her brain does not think as quickly as
20:54 most of our brains that's what I would
20:56 say is a just a shady tree psychologist
20:59 okay and so someone's whispering in her
21:03 ear that the world is coming to an end
21:07 they're whispering in her ear that she's
21:09 going to lose her childhood or she did
21:12 lose her childhood because of all these
21:14 faux climate change you know
21:17 pseudoscience deep state agenda21
21:22 carbon taxation depopulation
21:25 depopulating agendas what would be the
21:30 difference I'm being completely serious
21:32 here what would be the difference and
21:33 going into a mental institution and
21:36 finding some young girl who was scared
21:40 of something she's scared of clowns
21:42 let's just say and you put her in a room
21:45 and you incessantly address people fled
21:50 clowns and you make them look really
21:52 horrifying that it clown right and you
21:54 penny wise and you just keep bringing
21:56 they're just you have strobe lights on
21:58 and it's a dark room and John Podesta is
22:01 in there in his fluorescent pink
22:02 demanding that the child call him Skippy
22:04 and he's just they're just terrorizing
22:07 this girl in the corner what's the huge
22:10 difference I'm not sure there's any
22:14 difference if Greta is truly a kid with
22:18 Asperger's which means she is going to
22:20 be analyzing things at a intense level
22:23 and I got plenty of friends of mine with
22:24 clinical Asperger's and they don't act
22:26 anything like Greta they're fully
22:28 functional they don't they don't have
22:31 all of her weird
22:33 emotional tics and strange inability to
22:37 seem genuine I mean she seems like a bad
22:41 actress
22:42 I'm not buying quite frankly any mental
22:45 condition that she has I just think
22:47 she's a horrible actress and we've seen
22:49 better actresses pretend stories in
22:52 front of the Senate to get you know
22:55 Saddam Hussein kicked out of Kuwait but
23:00 it used to be that your kid would go
23:03 through weird phases and you just sort
23:06 of you know nudge them in the right
23:09 direction
23:09 another German the right direction my
23:10 kid didn't have any of this stuff but
23:12 I've seen it in my small town especially
23:14 I moved around and got to be in the big
23:16 city as a kid and see a lot of families
23:18 that you know so I'll go to school and
23:22 you just let him get through it and nine
23:26 times out of ten if not 99 times out of
23:28 100 the kid comes through and becomes
23:30 someone that could be married and be a
23:32 father or a mother and they're fine
23:36 it's almost every single time but what
23:39 they're trying to do today is buy the
23:42 objective of depopulation is they want
23:44 your child to freeze-frame in this weird
23:49 state of existence perhaps because they
23:51 watch a unicorn cartoon or something
23:56 strange on the Internet they get
23:59 mentally disturbed by what they see they
24:03 start portraying what they see let's
24:06 just say they you know they're they
24:08 haven't even thought about what
24:09 orientation they are yet you know it
24:12 used to be pretty pretty normal the kids
24:14 would go to at least 10 to 12 to 13 and
24:17 if you asked a girl if she liked boys up
24:20 to that point you know it'd be like you
24:22 yak you know that's why I got the word
24:24 cooties and sing with the boys you'd say
24:26 you know do you like her she's pretty
24:28 cute you gross you know you don't want
24:30 to kiss her oh man gross and they start
24:32 spitting you know and it's like that's
24:34 what kids used to be like but today
24:37 you've got kids that supposedly they got
24:41 these [ __ ] up parents right somehow
24:44 kid wants to have a sex change it's
24:47 years old you know there was that video
24:50 going around to that poor kid man I hope
24:54 some cops got involved with this thing
24:56 child protection care or something but
24:58 the father is interviewing his son who's
25:01 got a like a shirt on his head and he
25:03 says you know what are you doing oh I'm
25:06 a girl oh you are yeah well mommy says
25:09 I'm a girl and you know when I'm with
25:12 her she dresses up me and dresses I told
25:16 you I got a I got a second cousin who
25:19 had a crazy mother dressed him up like a
25:22 little girl until he was like you know I
25:24 don't know 12 years old well what do you
25:27 think his orientation is today
25:28 did he just magically have a crazy
25:32 mother and he's gay
25:33 no he had a crazy mother and he was
25:38 trying to figure out the basics of life
25:40 he got programmed behaviorally by his
25:45 crazy mother and you know he's a radical
25:49 leftist now go figure
25:51 and would what just blows my mind about
25:54 that whole thing is that the defense
25:56 mechanism starts to shoot up right I
25:59 have no doubt that if I were to
26:01 interview that guy and ask him that
26:04 exact question hey come on I saw a
26:06 picture personally a view at nine years
26:09 old just up like a little girl with a
26:11 little Bobby haircut and that kind of
26:13 stuff and everybody in town knows your
26:16 mother wanted a girl for a third child
26:18 you happen to be a boy and so she just
26:21 didn't accept the fact that you had
26:23 beans and Franks so she raised you like
26:25 a little girl don't you think that had a
26:27 profound effect on who you are as a
26:29 human being you're gonna throw this deal
26:31 at me that you have a gene in your body
26:33 that changed you over to this you
26:36 probably defended I have always been
26:39 this way I've always known them this way
26:41 and it's like you probably have but can
26:44 you pull back for a split second look at
26:46 yourself from 60,000 feet look at the
26:48 history of your life and go yeah my mom
26:50 completely [ __ ] me up she dictated my
26:55 orientation instead of allowing me to
26:57 find it now I got friends
27:00 who found it nobody pushed the mini
27:02 directions and there you go
27:05 whatever happened happened they picked
27:07 it picked it sometimes I have a friend
27:09 of mine he said he knew by
27:10 four-years-old
27:11 nobody was molesting the guy nobody was
27:14 doing anything quite the opposite and he
27:17 found his way ok great
27:19 they want your kid screwed up as soon as
27:22 humanly possible if they can't get your
27:24 kid to have a seizure and rot their
27:27 brain with the vaccinations they want
27:30 them to be under educated so they can't
27:32 get any work they want your kid to be
27:35 rejected by society you know I have this
27:38 weird suspicion that if we actually
27:42 somehow fully embraced all LGBTQ X Y Z
27:47 or whatever they can come up with that
27:50 would anger the elite it would anger
27:53 them that you know maybe these guys
27:55 would still have kids you know you're
27:56 trainees still have kids and you're
27:58 bisexual people still have kids and
28:00 you're Ellen you're both lesbian and gay
28:04 still have kids what if that just
28:06 started happening so they could be
28:08 exactly who they want to be orientation
28:10 wise but they still have kids guarantee
28:12 you there'd be something against those
28:14 people the second that they started
28:15 procreating but as long as they're
28:18 willing to take one for the team the big
28:20 banking cartel team there's going to be
28:23 support for these organizations it's
28:27 just the way it is let's get back to the
28:30 cancel culture right now it's a problem
28:34 for celebrities it's a problem for film
28:37 studios you know you tweeted something a
28:41 long time ago you posted something on
28:43 Facebook a long time ago boy they're
28:44 gonna come after you and there's two
28:48 halves to it that's both it's just it's
28:52 sick and it's unfortunate that we have
28:55 allowed society to get to this point one
28:58 you have your little cesspool of
29:00 scumbags that actually instigate this
29:03 thing and I wouldn't be I would be the
29:06 slightest bit surprised if there isn't
29:08 some George Soros funded
29:10 anteye PR group that goes out and pulls
29:14 the threader's thread the sweaters to
29:16 get this started
29:17 but the sickest thing about it is you
29:21 know we know there's some disgruntled
29:24 human being in some coffee shop
29:26 somewhere you know just literally
29:28 looking for this all day long we know
29:31 that's the case but what's worse is that
29:33 you have these other people who are in
29:38 the just normal citizens I guess and I
29:41 wouldn't say they're normal they're
29:42 dysfunctional but they're at home in
29:44 their houses taking the the lead on it
29:48 and then going after it in the thousands
29:52 right tens of thousands of people I do
29:57 think it is a tiny tiny group of people
29:59 that are causing all the problems for
30:01 everyone because it doesn't take much
30:04 for a company to get nervous about
30:06 something but we know that there's gang
30:08 stalking right this is when you get
30:12 rammed on the Internet's you could have
30:14 a job somewhere they find out where you
30:16 work they talk to that boss and that
30:19 boss fires you because they just simply
30:21 can't handle standing up for the
30:25 Constitution of the United States they
30:27 want all the benefits of the
30:28 Constitution themselves but they're not
30:31 willing to stand up for it when it comes
30:33 to one of their employees having a
30:34 differing opinion than theirs then you
30:37 have different layers of the entire
30:39 experience right you have people who are
30:42 legitimately doing things that are bad
30:46 you know what is it Prince Henry he
30:50 showed up at a Halloween party some 10
30:55 years ago and he was wearing a Nazi
30:57 armband with a Nazi tan
31:02 officers outfit on or whatever but he's
31:06 royalty so he gets to do it no problem
31:09 there then you have this this blackface
31:13 thing Trudeau who I am absolutely not a
31:17 fan of he's Castro's son if you don't
31:19 know he showed up as Aladdin and so heat
31:22 and out his face
31:24 he's a theater guy to begin with right
31:26 wasn't you a drama teacher or something
31:28 like that but a lot of people have worn
31:31 blackface which is a different thing
31:35 right blackface is a vaudeville thing
31:38 that a few white guys did back in the
31:40 day and they would act less intelligent
31:43 on stage making fun of blacks in the in
31:47 the in that era a certain category of
31:51 the older blacks when that area because
31:52 the younger ones were not having you
31:54 know these issues they're making fun of
31:58 a slice of the black culture here in
32:00 America
32:02 utterly offensive right but I have known
32:06 people that have well let's just take
32:09 Dave Chappelle and Eddie Murphy Eddie
32:13 Murphy was the first one on Saturday
32:14 Night Live to dress in white face he did
32:17 a brilliant funny skit later on 20 years
32:22 later 15 years later whatever it was
32:23 Dave Chappelle did it on the Dave
32:25 Chappelle show he took it to the next
32:27 limit right and it's all a parody on the
32:31 stereotypical perception that when
32:33 you're white you go to a bank
32:35 I can't I think it was Dave Chappelle
32:37 they did it but maybe an Eddie Murphy
32:39 camera one on one to the bank and he was
32:41 going to apply for a loan and he thought
32:44 he had to fill out all the paperwork and
32:46 what they did was as soon as like a
32:48 black assistant left the room they just
32:50 looked at the door closed and the I he
32:52 don't feel like I still here and he just
32:54 gave him like you know $40,000 cash do
32:58 you really want to go back in a time
32:59 machine and get rid of those skits what
33:02 are you an [ __ ]
33:02 give me a break that [ __ ] was hilarious
33:05 absolutely and I can't imagine that more
33:09 than one or two people got offended
33:10 watching it when millions and millions
33:13 of people are watching it I know people
33:16 that have dressed up like black people
33:17 for Halloween but their intent is that
33:22 they absolutely adored the black culture
33:27 they adored black music at black fashion
33:30 and they knew that they were corny white
33:32 people any other day but Halloween and
33:35 so what they did was they dressed up
33:38 mr. sell black afros all the time at
33:42 Halloween stores I think they still do
33:44 well who's allowed to wear that right
33:45 you just what to wear with white face
33:47 doesn't make any sense right
33:48 but I've seen people do that and for
33:51 that night they felt bigger than life
33:54 they felt cooler than they ever have in
33:57 their life being able to impersonate a
34:00 culture that they adored it wasn't to
34:05 talk in some broken English or to make
34:08 fun of anybody if anything it was quite
34:10 the opposite but what is it now you
34:14 touched a little bit of black makeup and
34:17 put it on your face and you're white
34:18 well then you're melt you're mocking
34:20 these people if I wanted to dress up
34:22 like a Native American because I have
34:24 long hair and I happen to absolutely
34:26 love everything that I've ever learned
34:29 about Native American culture and the
34:32 first film I ever wrote I did a
34:33 tremendous amount of research into it
34:35 visited reservations and my heart broken
34:39 for the suffering that these folks have
34:42 done but if I wanted to honor them in
34:44 some costume event I don't hear anyone
34:48 telling me that I'm making fun of them
34:50 or mocking them I think it was Ted
34:53 Danson who was dating Whoopi Goldberg
34:55 for a little while man if you can just
34:57 put that and you're together in your
34:58 brain you're a bigger man than me but he
35:03 did show up at some event with blackface
35:05 the old-fashioned kind where you paint
35:08 your lips white and and that was like
35:11 what were you thinking man
35:12 you can't dress up like a Nazi and get
35:17 away with it what what happy stories are
35:20 told about Nazis none all right but okay
35:25 let's keep it going
35:27 how many people show up at these events
35:30 dressed like the devil how can you do
35:33 that he's always the bad guy he's always
35:37 the bad guy but they sell the devil
35:39 outfit on Amazon and no one's calling to
35:41 have it taken down we have double
35:44 standards all over the place if you
35:46 really want to start to censor our
35:49 existence
35:50 what would you do if anyone walked up to
35:53 you randomly on the street there a big
35:56 guy very very specifically a male with
35:59 upper-body strength and they just
36:02 grabbed you and held you and you
36:05 couldn't move you couldn't move your
36:06 arms and you couldn't fight out of their
36:09 grip because they're much much bigger
36:11 than you well you're at least going to
36:14 try to get out of that grip you're gonna
36:18 try even if it's an irrational thing for
36:20 you to do because it is your nature to
36:24 want freedom if someone came up to you
36:27 and said I'm going to sew your mouth
36:30 shut I'm gonna surgically remove your
36:32 tongue you're not gonna be able to speak
36:35 anymore how would you feel about that be
36:38 like yeah you know whatever I've talked
36:40 enough it's over really so what's the
36:45 difference between someone passing some
36:48 sort of law some sort of psycho insane
36:53 cultural norm that says you can't be who
36:57 you are now again some people again I've
37:02 got some super leftists in my family
37:04 that tried to win the argument by saying
37:06 oh I guess what you're saying like I've
37:09 said this before I know I'm repeating
37:10 myself what we're here now I had this
37:13 person tell me oh I guess what you're
37:15 trying to say is that we want to call
37:17 all the black people the n-word again as
37:20 if that had any intellectual capacity or
37:23 rationale in anyone's normal mind
37:27 I mean seriously speaking probably one
37:30 of the most ignorant stupid things I've
37:32 ever heard another human being ever say
37:35 yeah that's what I'm talking about well
37:38 I don't get enough of the n-word out of
37:40 my mouth I feel like I'm being repressed
37:42 right I mean remember the formula right
37:46 if you were to sit at a table having a
37:50 conversation with one of these morons
37:52 right when he's triggered cancel culture
37:58 political correct morons an [ __ ]
38:02 and bullies across from a table and it
38:06 was some theoretical thing it's infinite
38:08 and you're talking eventually you're
38:12 gonna bump into some words that they're
38:14 gonna try to use their useless life to
38:18 control your life right they've got no
38:20 command over their own life they hate
38:21 the mirror more than anything in the
38:23 entire universe and so they want you to
38:26 be punished because they view themselves
38:28 horribly okay so you go oh I can't say
38:32 that word anymore
38:33 yeah I can't say it word anymore what
38:34 word can I use and they give you a new
38:36 word okay and you replace that in your
38:39 brain one is starting to create
38:40 cognitive dissidence because the word
38:42 you were using is exactly the right word
38:44 but now they're giving you some in their
38:47 mind softer phrase used to be [ __ ]
38:52 now it's mentally handicapped mentally
38:54 handicapped is going to be mentally
38:56 impaired and they mentally impaired is
38:59 gonna be something else but if you sit
39:01 there with them infinitely whatever they
39:03 gave you to replace that word with
39:05 eventually when you comply with all of
39:09 their control mechanisms then all of a
39:12 sudden you're able to be free because
39:15 using all the words that are okay they
39:17 have no more authority over you but
39:20 that's the name of the game for a bully
39:22 for a [ __ ] for a person who hates
39:25 themselves and so they're gonna think up
39:29 new words they're gonna start demonizing
39:31 new words you've never heard of and
39:33 they're gonna start demonizing the old
39:35 ones because those are the old goat oohs
39:36 man a word is what you think it means
39:40 man and so you need to be careful with
39:43 what you think something means clinical
39:46 words being demonized is is so laughable
39:50 now someone could see just a word that
39:53 you might choose to use because it
39:56 sounds a little bit better than the
39:58 previous word that's a free society
40:02 simply refining language a little bit
40:05 you know it used to be for instance at
40:09 least when I was a kid and you'll still
40:11 see references to this you know in
40:15 videos that are third
40:16 4050 years old but it used to be a
40:19 respectable phrase to call black person
40:22 Negro they thought of that word as a
40:27 upper echelon reference to a black
40:30 person because they knew about the other
40:32 word the other end word that was never
40:35 considered to be anything but a
40:38 derogatory reference but you can't see
40:43 Negro anymore either because in the head
40:46 it's been conditioned that person
40:48 doesn't like you the person doesn't like
40:49 you they're making you a subhuman by
40:52 calling you that it's just like saying
40:54 Caucasian that's all it is no black is
41:00 they're not black right nobody in the
41:02 world is black okay you go to Africa
41:05 they're a little bit darker okay but
41:07 just like calling a white person away
41:08 person okay you go to Ireland you can
41:11 actually find white people but most
41:13 people have a bunch of different pinks
41:15 and a bunch of different shades in them
41:16 they're never one color so Negro was
41:20 next to Caucasian and black was next to
41:23 white if you want to go for a color
41:24 right all of its nonsensical random
41:28 arbitrary references to each other but
41:32 I'm gonna repeat something it's a bit of
41:33 a spoiler from Dave Chappelle's stand-up
41:36 comedy routine so you've been warned
41:40 this is this is brilliant though hearing
41:43 it from me doesn't destroy anything he
41:48 has a routine about talking to the
41:51 censors of his show and it was a double
41:57 standard they had about certain words
42:00 you could use in certain words you
42:03 couldn't use and he has an absolutely
42:05 brilliant profound a truly profound
42:08 realization that he reveals on his
42:11 special and I'm not going to try to
42:13 recreate it because you know you need to
42:15 hear from his voice but I literally was
42:18 just stunned when I heard it I was like
42:20 oh my god that is absolutely true and it
42:24 was the bit when you see it it is about
42:27 the double standard of him being able to
42:29 use the in
42:30 and not being able to use word that
42:34 starts with F that refers to gay people
42:36 and this double standard that they had
42:39 internally and he twisted it such that
42:43 the censor probably didn't get it but so
42:46 that we could understand that there was
42:48 this crazy double standard about the way
42:52 that language is used so I think the big
42:55 thing I would personally like to see
42:59 would be the public endorsing well one
43:04 categorically rejecting this notion of
43:07 gang stalking people the further past
43:10 right dave chappelle talks about how the
43:13 gang stalked kevin hart out of being
43:15 able to host the oscars right because he
43:19 made a joke he made a joke that was
43:22 completely a joke inside of a joke i
43:25 mean it was like the most ridiculous
43:27 thing and it was about if kevin hart
43:31 found his son playing with dolls he said
43:35 that the punishment he would do to his
43:39 son would be to smash a doll house over
43:41 his head which is a completely
43:44 ridiculous thing when you never do that
43:46 but - how would you have a dollhouse in
43:48 the first place you know you would you
43:49 would know ahead of time right but it
43:51 was just a stupid joke he made a really
43:53 long time ago and some wood dug that up
43:55 threw it at the academy
43:57 and of course there's such virtue
43:59 signaling folks that they took away a
44:03 dream of his the people really were the
44:06 ones that took away the dream but what's
44:09 also so strange is that in organizations
44:12 like TMZ coms you've never gone you
44:14 don't need to go but it is a the most
44:18 vile rag of worshipping everything that
44:23 is wrong with the world
44:24 I mean worshipping the [ __ ]
44:27 behavior on planet earth as well as some
44:30 of the most you know anti productive it
44:33 conspicuous consumption of cars and
44:36 jewelry and just the whole you know gang
44:40 violence thing inside rap
44:42 they worship they TMZ's the kind of
44:45 organization that would get two gangs to
44:49 fight over each other and to kill each
44:52 other right they would run to one gang
44:53 said you know what that gang said about
44:55 you and they'd run over the other gang
44:56 he said you know what they said about
44:57 you and they get them to fight and then
45:00 the second that everybody kills each
45:03 other they're right there to make money
45:05 off of the death that they instigated I
45:08 mean they're there for the whole
45:10 lifecycle of a celebrity the hey this
45:13 person's coming up oh look how bad they
45:15 look down look at the ugly person that
45:17 they ended up marrying or hate did you
45:19 know in the divorce this is because of
45:21 this this and this bunch of personal
45:23 crap that's none of your [ __ ] business
45:24 in the first place and people go up
45:26 there because they they hate themselves
45:28 again right and they want to know that
45:31 celebrities also have horrible moments
45:35 in life because there can't be anyone in
45:38 life who gets through this thing without
45:40 suffering that's the kind of people
45:42 we're talking about here mentally ill
45:45 human beings they're mentally ill
45:47 something happened to them again could
45:50 be the toxins they feel their body with
45:52 it could be the shitty parents that they
45:54 had could be just they were totally okay
45:58 when a teen kicked out of the house to
46:00 go live a life and they just couldn't
46:02 make it happen because they'd have
46:03 enough IQ to live their own sovereign
46:06 life right you know when you're raised
46:08 in a at least in America you'll
46:10 definitely learn about all the crazy
46:13 moments in time where you know the
46:17 morons of the world destroy the geniuses
46:20 of the world happens all the time why do
46:23 you think Egypt is a big relic of
46:26 ancient history because the Egyptians
46:29 were wiped out and why were they wiped
46:31 out because they had abolished war if
46:34 they even if they ever had war they
46:36 managed to get rid of it and they had
46:39 chariots simply for the sake of maybe
46:42 having a celebration
46:44 perhaps hunting maybe right but when
46:49 factions came around that didn't have
46:52 that brilliance they got jealous
46:55 the haves and the have-nots right so
46:59 they had to take it away they had to
47:00 destroy something wonderful and set us
47:03 back God knows how many millennia how
47:06 many tens of thousands of millennia they
47:09 set us back
47:10 you know Genghis Khan when all across
47:13 Europe all across Eurasia and Europe now
47:18 think about it
47:19 did someone in Germania hurt Genghis
47:23 Khan clear on the other side of the
47:25 continent no the guy was just a dick
47:29 the guy just prioritized building an
47:32 army and so they raped and pillaged all
47:37 the way across this continent okay isn't
47:43 that the precursor story to most folks
47:47 that go and persecute another country
47:50 but now we've actually got every piece
47:53 of real estate claimed right there's not
47:55 any real estate in the world that isn't
47:56 owned by some country and you've got
47:58 some islands in the Pacific people
48:00 arguing it over who gives a [ __ ] right
48:02 so now what are they doing now who is
48:06 pulling the strings and why are they
48:08 pulling the strings I think it's funny
48:12 that it used to be when I was a kid when
48:17 you were dumb as a bag of hammers you
48:19 knew you were dumb as a bag of hammers
48:20 you just knew and you didn't try to
48:23 compete with those that were smarter
48:25 than you as long as you weren't being
48:28 repressed you never even acted out
48:30 violently you knew that if you wanted to
48:33 get smart if you needed to get smart
48:34 you'd had to go learn something from
48:37 somebody right you just did or you were
48:39 totally fine with not knowing a bunch of
48:42 stuff and you just you know had a
48:44 beautiful simple life you lived happily
48:46 ever after maybe even maybe even happier
48:49 than those that were technically more
48:53 intelligent than you okay I think that's
48:55 great I know a lot of people like that
48:57 I'm envious of some people that are more
49:02 simple with their lives because they're
49:04 happier than I am I'm pretty happy guy
49:06 you know
49:07 but today if we were to line up everyone
49:12 in the United States of America and
49:14 actually have them take some sort of
49:15 tests with and the test would go like
49:19 this without taking an IQ test how smart
49:22 you think you are how high do you think
49:24 your IQ is in comparison to the smartest
49:27 people in the world and I think that you
49:30 would find that the more intelligent
49:31 people with the higher IQs would
49:33 actually be under estimating their
49:35 intelligence and your antifa douchebags
49:38 would be putting their IQs way up there
49:41 I know I'm probably a hundred and eighty
49:42 at least 180 probably 250 they think
49:46 they're utterly utterly brilliant isn't
49:51 that funny how that works I mean I
49:52 guarantee you there's a huge part of
49:54 that that's true guarantee and what is
49:58 the cycle today you start talking to
50:02 somebody who's obviously full of it and
50:06 if you start to slowly and calmly and
50:10 graciously try to reveal the fact that
50:13 maybe they're not as intelligent as they
50:16 think they are as informed as they think
50:18 they are maybe they should go look into
50:19 it again maybe they should do a little
50:21 bit of research instead of just watching
50:24 CNN today they'll throw shakes on you
50:30 itch in the face with padlocks try to
50:33 slam their skateboard because they can't
50:36 afford a car they're getting violent now
50:40 they're getting violent because they
50:42 hate the the experience of being in
50:46 their own skin that's what it is
50:49 can you imagine them waking up and you
50:53 hate who you are as a human being and I
50:55 mean I'm not talking about disliking
50:57 your life a little bit or kind of feel
50:59 like you made some wrong decisions these
51:02 kids feel broken to the core and
51:06 probably because they have three dozen
51:09 vaccinations inside themselves plus
51:11 whatever flu shots that come around and
51:13 they believe all this news about you
51:16 know these diseases that are almost
51:18 completely eradicated off the face of
51:20 the planet
51:21 yes a pharmaceutical company provides a
51:23 vaccination they take it so their
51:26 neurons in their brain are just being
51:27 shredded on a daily basis they're
51:31 disoriented hate is probably not a word
51:35 that remotely efficiently describes what
51:38 they feel about themselves so then you
51:42 might take it to the next level cheese
51:44 can we rehabilitate these people I think
51:50 the answer is probably yes but as I
51:53 mentioned in a previous episode you have
51:55 a problem that it's going to take a lot
51:58 of time and the most vivid example that
52:02 I gave in a previous video is which is
52:05 probably in my cultural racism video is
52:08 the white people that stood in line
52:11 outside of the schools that were being
52:14 desegregated as the black kids got off
52:17 the bus there's this famous scene with
52:18 his black girl who's dressed to the
52:21 nines she looks amazing and she's
52:23 walking into the school and some white
52:25 girl with Oliver a KKK Democrats
52:27 standing behind her she's a Democrat too
52:29 by the way is screaming obscenities at
52:32 this girl and I mean just the empathetic
52:38 just even the tiniest bit of empathy for
52:40 this black girl you just want to like
52:43 you want to punch the wire on the face
52:45 and you want to give this black girl hug
52:47 for having to endure such horrible
52:50 acidic behavior from anybody but
52:54 especially someone who's you know
52:56 privileged stealing at some kid he was
52:58 just trying to get a good education it's
52:59 just hideous right but they're all
53:02 Democrats down there are yelling at the
53:04 blacks remember the Democrats up until
53:07 1959 on the Pitt on on the laws fought
53:11 desegregation but later on 20 years
53:15 later or thirty years later I don't know
53:17 when this woman was recorded but they
53:18 found that white girl and they did an
53:23 interview in her living room and she was
53:26 sobbing with tears running down her face
53:27 because she had finally got away from
53:31 the Democrats
53:32 and figured out that hey Republicans
53:36 believe that everyone's made equal in
53:39 different ways but were made equal and
53:42 she had figured out that she had
53:44 basically worshiped the devil because of
53:49 a party affiliation with the Democrats
53:50 and you know I can't remember if they
53:55 ever found the black girl to interview
53:58 her I would have loved to have seen that
53:59 would love to have seen them in the same
54:02 room together you know I see the apology
54:05 go across the room and that would have
54:06 been nice maybe I can't remember that
54:08 happening so we've been here before
54:13 we've seen people repair themselves you
54:18 know part of my hope is that we can
54:20 continue taking the piss out of these
54:21 people that are like this you know again
54:25 reminding and Tifa kid that the
54:26 Confederate flag is a democratic flag
54:28 remind the antifa kid that the statues
54:31 that they tore down a Confederate
54:32 soldiers were Democrat Confederate
54:37 statues remind them that MLK was a
54:40 Republican you know these are little
54:43 basic things the KKK was a Democrat
54:45 organization and you have to remind them
54:48 that there was no flip in the 70s the
54:50 only thing that they did is they did the
54:52 demonic devil thing which is to go on TV
54:55 and say oh yeah we totally worship that
54:59 Satan at the Church of Satan down the
55:01 street but you know contrary to rumor we
55:04 don't actually sacrifice human beings
55:05 and children and drink their blood and
55:07 all that kind of stuff and so you take
55:09 that I mean some people take that go
55:11 well you know the interview those people
55:13 and they said they don't do that ok
55:16 [ __ ]
55:17 yeah you really think you're gonna get a
55:19 truthful answer out of the devil you
55:20 really think that that's how the dude
55:22 rolls you really dead Church under the
55:25 threat of being closed down is going to
55:29 admit well we only kill a few of you
55:32 folks right I mean you know you gotta
55:35 have something on the side of the milk
55:36 carton right once we cease tolerating
55:42 mental illness as a something we have to
55:46 integrate
55:46 society as in the mental illness is
55:49 going to be an option for your children
55:52 and their behavior once we get rid of
55:54 that we're on the right track once we
55:58 see a violent protest with an
56:02 organization that hides their face runs
56:04 a or does it mostly nice flag with a
56:08 different color scheme once we go okay
56:12 now you're a terrorist organization your
56:13 whole organization from New York City to
56:17 Los Angeles you are considered
56:19 terrorists we are going to activate the
56:22 police force of this country including
56:25 maybe even reserve military that if you
56:28 show up with this flag if you show up
56:30 with your face covered up we're gonna
56:33 bash your head in and put you in the
56:35 back of a truck and you're gonna go to
56:38 jail for a very long time 10-year
56:43 mandatory no parole sentences because
56:46 you're part of a terrorist organization
56:48 once we get to that point we're making
56:50 some progress in my opinion and if you
56:54 think that that's crazy you haven't been
56:57 hit in the face by a Berkeley professor
56:59 who ties a padlock through the end of a
57:02 rope and slams you in the face
57:04 because again he's a loser he's a
57:09 complete loser right
57:10 Trump uses that word a lot and everyone
57:12 gets all bent out of shape and it's like
57:13 no Trump is looking at a bunch of
57:16 children that have run this country for
57:18 a long time giving away all of our jobs
57:20 all of our trade all of our aid and what
57:25 did we get in return
57:26 Wars and people who hate us to death oh
57:31 boy would be a bad thing dig first pick
57:35 out the swamp members and go these are
57:37 all losers these are all scumbags they
57:39 all need to go you know people who are
57:42 still senators after 20 30 years of
57:46 being in that business come on what's
57:50 the motivation to not go enjoy life
57:52 why is Nancy Pelosi at 79 still being us
57:57 huge pain in the ass to everybody
57:58 Feinstein 80
58:00 five years old go [ __ ] relax would
58:03 you take your ill-gotten gains and go
58:06 enjoy your precursor to hell okay which
58:10 is the last few years of your life on
58:12 this planet and what's really strange
58:14 about it is is that here's what I
58:18 haven't heard so far I haven't heard a
58:20 case where there's a cancel cancel
58:24 culture thing going on and let's say
58:27 there's you know 5,000 morons who write
58:31 into the Academy to get Kevin Hart
58:34 thrown off of the the Oscars but 20,000
58:39 people write letters saying don't pay
58:42 attention to those other 5,000 people or
58:45 whatever it is we want the guy to host
58:48 the thing and have the academy go oh
58:50 well you know the majority people
58:52 actually seem to like this guy well we
58:55 don't want to take the risk and he still
58:57 let the minority speak or maybe it's
58:59 just a big virtuously thing or maybe
59:01 they got something is black people who
59:02 knows but I'd like to see that done once
59:05 and that's when you know what can you do
59:10 to stop it I don't know why don't you go
59:13 rent Blazing Saddles off some streaming
59:15 you know service but the statistics out
59:19 there that you're still interested in
59:21 things that could not be made today you
59:25 know Hollywood is died and been reborn
59:27 several times but it happens in real
59:31 time so we don't quite identify the
59:34 death of Hollywood one of the huge
59:37 deaths of Hollywood that happened was
59:38 during the 60s and for those of you are
59:42 movie buffs you'll know this is very
59:44 true Hollywood got extremely formulaic
59:48 and they always usually mention like
59:50 Elvis movies as being sort of the bottom
59:52 of that era now technically these movies
59:57 are fun because we just like seeing
59:58 Elvis move around and hear him talk
60:00 instead of seeing so that was kind of
60:02 fun there shot in Technicolor but other
60:06 than a few masterpieces coming out of
60:09 the 60s
60:11 normal movies were being as watched as
60:14 much rate Plus television was exploding
60:18 by 1965 RC had lost the patent on color
60:23 television so everybody want color but
60:27 this is when the you know the indie
60:30 movie thing started occurring people
60:31 were able to buy their own cameras and
60:35 so you saw a bunch of wild films like
60:37 John water stuff which I'm not a big fan
60:39 of but you know he did it it's a bunch
60:42 of wild things occurred you know Rocky
60:44 Horror Picture Show and just tons of
60:46 stuff in the 70s and yeah there are a
60:49 lot of crappy movies when they made the
60:51 transition over to the indie stuff even
60:54 Kubrick sort of waited for all that to
60:57 boil off and then he made Clockwork
60:59 Orange which was for him as I understand
61:01 it was fairly an indie process you know
61:06 there's a lot of rumors that in a
61:08 civilian but I've heard that the the
61:13 movie never officially had a script he
61:15 just passed out the paper buck paperback
61:17 book and said ok we're in this page
61:18 let's go of course he makes changes in
61:22 alterations to it so I think we're at a
61:25 point now where yeah I think CG was a
61:29 rebirth of Hollywood in the 90s we had
61:32 had the 70s in the 80s with in-camera
61:35 effects like Star Wars and then we got
61:38 to CG and CG started changing everything
61:40 and there was this huge rebirth and now
61:42 we're at the death of CG right people
61:45 are tired of movies with CG bad guys you
61:49 know how many CG bad guys are in John
61:50 wick zero John wicks doing well now
61:56 there's still Jumanji 's and marvel
61:58 movies and all that kind of stuff but I
61:59 think you know we're everyone sort of
62:01 even tired of the Marvel formula we like
62:03 them ok but we don't want 20 more
62:07 we just don't and so we're now getting
62:11 back to more meat-and-potato movies it's
62:15 cool but but if anything the cancel
62:20 culture has shown you
62:22 a beautiful reveal of the dimensions by
62:26 which we exist as human beings because
62:27 they are picking apart these dimensions
62:30 they're using any technique in the book
62:32 to succeed in piercing these dimensions
62:36 and using it against us to cancel
62:39 culture I mean I know it's it's a double
62:43 entendre it's a it's the culture of
62:46 getting people canceled off of their
62:47 shows and getting comedians booed
62:49 offstage and all that kind of stuff it's
62:51 all about how how much can you hate
62:54 which I'd like to see Twitter go out of
62:56 business quite frankly I think it is it
62:59 is unlike anything we have ever had in
63:03 the history of the world in terms of
63:06 acidic incubation of human behavior we
63:12 have seen it in in countries you know
63:15 what does it melt saying tongue got a
63:17 bunch of people killed in China by
63:21 incubating up things Hitler did the same
63:23 thing Pol Pot did the same thing Stalin
63:26 did the same thing and so we've seen
63:29 this in history in specific areas but
63:34 now we have global hatred and you know
63:40 it's just one of these things like when
63:41 are you gonna activate your mutant gene
63:43 when are you gonna start and I'm not
63:45 really talking to you guys because you
63:46 guys are the choir but as you conversate
63:49 with other people these are the touch
63:50 points what are you gonna have skin in
63:52 the game what are you gonna just turn
63:55 off social media you know I've I've in
64:01 the last I'd say week I've looked up a
64:04 few actors and actresses because I think
64:07 that they would do well for some of the
64:09 stuff I'm writing and I was shocked it
64:11 some of them have no social media and I
64:15 mean they don't have a website that they
64:18 control they don't have any Facebook
64:19 Twitter Instagram or anything and it's
64:22 stunning to find I'm just like it's
64:25 almost like I want to refine them in the
64:27 world and tell them that I'm proud of
64:29 them they're staying out of the game
64:32 they're focusing on their life's
64:35 you know what is what is the trend today
64:38 go do something fairly cool or you know
64:43 whatever that least in the camera is
64:45 gonna look amazing and get it to social
64:47 media as quickly as possible make
64:48 everyone jealous of what you're doing
64:50 it's it's rough it's rough and we've got
64:54 to grow up as a society maybe this is
64:56 something that is allowing us to expose
64:59 these acidic attributes of our ego of
65:02 our heed that now we can stop them out
65:05 all right the roaches of our of our mind
65:10 have crawled out under the refrigerator
65:11 you know we can see them now now we just
65:13 need to run around stomping them all out
65:15 so that they can die and then what's
65:17 left here's a human being I'll close
65:21 with this phrase or with this sentiment
65:25 here I've told you guys at nauseam that
65:28 I grew up in a little tiny town in South
65:31 East Kansas and I remember being a kid
65:36 and and for a good majority of the
65:39 portion I spent there I loved it and I
65:42 just embraced it you know my whole
65:44 family lived in that town both sides of
65:46 the family all the shops downtown were
65:49 fun to visit every street was fun to go
65:51 down my bicycle or whatever my car when
65:54 I grew up but as I got older in my teens
65:57 I remember having pings by watching
66:00 television that all the kids in the big
66:03 city we're getting all these privileges
66:06 that I that I was not getting where I
66:09 lived I was jealous I thought they were
66:10 getting better education they definitely
66:13 have more things to do there's probably
66:16 some truth to that but now I look at
66:20 kids today and they are exposed to so
66:25 many horrific things on a daily basis be
66:28 it violence be it social programming
66:32 that I feel like I am the last
66:36 generation of the lucky kids to have had
66:40 all my formative years outside of this
66:43 horrific thing that is social media
66:47 now there's obviously benefits to it of
66:49 course there always is and probably the
66:51 negative stuff mmm you know if you're on
66:53 Twitter it's all negative but there's
66:55 definitely great things you know YouTube
66:57 man I have learned so many things on
66:58 YouTube it's crazy so there's still a
67:01 lot of virtue and benefit from some of
67:04 these platforms and if we what's
67:08 happened to these platforms is this
67:09 society is programming the platforms by
67:14 throwing around all their offense right
67:18 unless we get offended the less these
67:20 folks will care you know we do know that
67:23 a lot of these folks are deep Staters
67:26 that's gonna take a few decades to
67:28 totally clean it out globally and we'll
67:30 get it done we'll get it done I've
67:35 interested in your observations in this
67:37 may be even more poignant Lee if you
67:43 have seen corrections to these horrible
67:46 situations where people have dug
67:48 themselves out of situations maybe
67:50 that's the that some of the comments
67:53 that you could leave you know if I was
67:57 doing another episode on cancer and
67:58 there's ten of you that have cured
68:00 cancer with watermelons and magnets or
68:02 whatever it is right and by the way I'm
68:07 making that up but let's just say you
68:09 have solutions your comments could save
68:12 a life so in this particular case think
68:15 about your social comments and
68:17 commentary maybe even saving a life
68:20 getting a kid out of the hatred bubble
68:23 or you know you're passing something on
68:26 to someone else that then they can take
68:27 off to their kid or their relative of
68:29 their friend it's just the way you
68:31 phrase it is the way that's gonna make
68:33 the difference which is why a comment is
68:35 worth you know entire lifetimes anyway
68:40 they can feel me if you haven't been at
68:43 deep thoughts radio calm please go gonna
68:44 do a super short bumper there options
68:46 for video audio social media donating to
68:49 the page and the all-new remaster in
68:51 season one so get up there and partake
68:55 until the next episode take care of
68:57 yourself and someone else and I'll see
68:59 in the next deep thoughts
