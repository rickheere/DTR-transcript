00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentlemen I've been singing today so my
00:34 voice is gonna be a little rusty your
00:38 voice is like a an instrument right get
00:42 a practice like a muscle so about a week
00:47 and a half ago I recorded this episode I
00:50 thought it turned out really well
00:53 then of course Final Cut has this
00:57 infinite capability of saying it's got
01:00 your video and then you pull the card
01:03 out and check the video give it a name
01:05 and then it just magically disappears I
01:08 swear to God so I got the audio but out
01:11 of the video but to be honest I could
01:14 probably do a better job the second time
01:15 around because it was sort of one of
01:18 those things I was setting up and I came
01:22 out and I just you know made up my mind
01:23 to do it this is gonna be about the 1982
01:28 movie Tron now some of you might listen
01:31 to this because you're a huge fan of
01:32 Tron you're just gonna want to know what
01:34 another dude thinks there's some DNA
01:37 here for you so I'm gonna hook you guys
01:42 in the first two minutes here some of
01:45 you will never seen it and you look back
01:48 on it and it doesn't its value doesn't
01:52 you know really make sense you know why
01:54 is everybody thinks this movie's great
01:56 or those who do what if it gets great
01:58 there's a whole nother fan base that's
02:00 legacy based we'll talk about that as
02:04 well but here's your hook yours truly
02:09 got into computers profusely because of
02:13 this movie and then I ended up working
02:17 for and working with as both business
02:20 partners being mentored by people nearly
02:24 every single person who's worked on this
02:27 film I guess in the more you know making
02:31 of DVD things of course I work for
02:33 Sydney for now 20 years Richard Taylor
02:36 and I are literally best friends
02:38 we've done businesses together but
02:42 business partners together for years
02:44 Stephen listen Berger and I are
02:46 extremely good friends and he's
02:47 extremely helpful with my career in
02:49 writing as well as many folks who worked
02:54 on all the 3d effects a little bit of
02:58 sound I haven't met Wendy Carlos and I
03:00 probably never will so I'm gonna give
03:02 you some DNA and some insights into
03:04 things that you will have never heard
03:06 before unless you have literally been to
03:08 every single speech that these people
03:11 have given because there's a lot of
03:13 stuff on the 25th anniversary DVD
03:15 collection that I'm not going to repeat
03:17 here some that I will simply because
03:20 it's a part of the story so hang on
03:22 hopefully you got some fun stuff for you
03:24 and there's a reason why I wrote my own
03:28 version of Tron 3 after reading the one
03:32 that they cancelled just gonna let it
03:34 out of the [ __ ] bag here they're
03:36 never gonna make sure on three if they
03:39 make Tron 3 it'll be a completely
03:40 different franchise or some amazing
03:43 changes in opinion will have gone on
03:46 inside the Disney franchise but I've
03:50 heard their decisions and as much as I
03:53 don't want to agree with it in just in
03:57 light if I want the movie to occur I
04:00 understand after reading what Joe put
04:03 together I completely understand why
04:06 they flushed it down the toilet so it's
04:10 90 to 80 is usually when you think about
04:13 this film being made or you know it gets
04:16 greenlit at Disney and they start
04:18 production for two years and they
04:19 release it in August of 1982 technically
04:23 speaking it gets greenlit a little bit
04:25 before that but the cool thing about
04:27 this film is everything you know it is
04:31 that you have a country and a world that
04:36 barely has home computers and I mean
04:38 barely there were a few out there for
04:40 sale they were trying to make them
04:41 popular but even if you bought one you
04:45 didn't know what the hell you were
04:46 bringing home you didn't know how to do
04:48 anything
04:49 most of computers you'd bring him home
04:51 turn it
04:52 it was just a flashing cursor it's good
04:54 to put a disc in which very few people
04:55 owned you put a cartridge in for the
04:58 cheaper computers or maybe you had a
05:00 tape cassette that would load a program
05:04 over a very long period of time and then
05:06 by god you do not turn the power off
05:08 because the program then disappears
05:10 you gotta reload everything in I
05:12 literally know my one of my girlfriends
05:15 and in Kansas her father's job was
05:20 anytime they lost power at their company
05:23 he had to type in all the code for the
05:27 software that they used to manage this
05:30 fairly popular farming equipment company
05:34 which is so stupid they just need to buy
05:36 a little bit of hardware and shave it
05:38 out to a cassette but nobody knew
05:40 anything about this and that was the mid
05:42 eighties right so the reason why Tron
05:46 the first one is so amazing is that
05:51 every single person who participated in
05:53 it we're hitting their very first
05:56 amazing peak of their career not
05:59 probably the peak but boy they were in
06:01 the pocket man and so you also have
06:05 these colliding forces of just amazing
06:10 human beings with amazing portfolios all
06:14 coming together bringing what they do
06:17 best and then you have this amazing film
06:21 but I'm going to take you behind the
06:23 scenes for the stuff that I always hear
06:25 from my buddies who made it wrote and
06:27 directed it that all special effects for
06:29 it did all the designs for it the only
06:32 individual that I had a light
06:34 relationship with online was Mobius it's
06:37 actually a very kind of sobering story
06:40 you know I reached out to him after
06:42 working for Sid for at least a decade
06:44 and but not even quite a decade about
06:46 five years I just reached out to him
06:48 because he was in Paris and he's one of
06:51 the artists that did half of the design
06:52 Sid - the other half but I just you know
06:55 I found he had a really beautiful
06:56 website I kind of reached out to him
06:57 identified who I was and who I work with
06:59 on my own and he was gracious enough
07:03 just to give me some nice replies and
07:05 then
07:05 out of the blue he emails me because
07:08 he's coming to Los Angeles and he wants
07:10 to do a round of you know dinners and
07:13 things with people and so I find myself
07:16 in that capacity he just surprisingly
07:20 alot because you feel like you know that
07:21 guy Raina might well yoni don't you know
07:23 him you guys work together in the past
07:25 yeah yeah but it's been a long time I
07:26 want to eat dinner set it up and I'm
07:29 like okay making two phone calls making
07:31 sure people are connected but Mobius
07:34 came to Los Angeles he was able to hit a
07:36 fair amount of the dinners I will say
07:40 one of the people I named passed on the
07:43 dinner and then Mobius went back to
07:46 Paris and died of cancer and I will tell
07:50 you this we lost a genius illustrator a
07:54 genius inventor I mean in terms of what
07:56 he would design and what he would draw
07:58 there's very few people I think in world
08:00 history well who will ever have the
08:02 record capabilities of Mobius I mean the
08:06 guy he could you just tell him something
08:09 and the guy would just go oh yeah it's
08:11 full 3d whatever he wants to do he's
08:13 just drawing with the pin
08:14 he was just phenomenal looked the guy up
08:16 he's phenomenal rate but the story of
08:19 where this comes from has been revealed
08:20 a little bit on the DVDs this is with my
08:25 life this is gonna just it's the most
08:27 bizarre thing to me it's it's absolutely
08:29 fascinating because I was always near
08:32 this group of people without even
08:34 knowing it and then to call them my
08:37 family now it's gigantic
08:39 for me personally so there's this
08:43 animation studio on the East Coast
08:44 called list burger studios named after
08:46 Steven this burger it was a prodigy
08:49 artist also just a prodigy in life the
08:53 guy just gets life okay he gets
08:55 everything right because very few people
08:57 have the you know both a business savvy
09:02 and the art savvy and the guy can either
09:05 do both simultaneously or he knows who
09:08 to hire to get the other side plus he
09:10 hired a bunch of fabulous artists of his
09:12 own just legendary folks right
09:16 but he's in the East Coast for a little
09:18 while and he's making animated
09:20 commercials and you know really high-end
09:23 stuff really beautiful stuff some of the
09:25 stuff that they did
09:27 besides the animal Olympics which I
09:29 don't believe has ever aired anywhere
09:31 but it was Disney quality animation just
09:33 before Tron got greenlit they did
09:37 bubblicious commercials McDonald
09:38 commercials you know bubblicious kid
09:40 that would blow the bubble and fly
09:41 around the neighborhood that was less
09:42 burger studios but he did this one
09:45 generic piece of art with this
09:47 electronic guy and he got looked like a
09:50 football player and he kind of you know
09:54 digitizes into form
09:57 this is just like a generic piece of art
09:58 that's animated and he threw out these
10:01 discs of light and they weren't
10:04 completely completed this it was like
10:06 light chasing itself in a disc shape and
10:08 both of them went out and he would grab
10:10 both um he slams it together and this
10:13 was the logo animation for wordlist
10:15 burger studios but they figured out hey
10:18 we've created this beautiful piece of
10:20 animation why don't we just branded at
10:22 the end and sell it to anybody who buy
10:23 it so I was in Massachusetts from like
10:27 1980 1983 and I think the radio station
10:30 was like W coz something like that but
10:34 they bought that animation from him it
10:36 was always on TV when I was a kid and
10:38 you'd see this crazy thing because my
10:40 minds is like looking at this thing it's
10:41 phenomenal but the reason why I super
10:44 remember it in addition to the wild
10:47 animation which was just impactful I
10:49 mean you got you got muscle in this
10:52 animation you got cool electronics but
10:55 the slogan of this radio station was
10:58 kick-ass rock and roll and back in the
11:01 early 80s to say kick ass on television
11:03 was like whoo you know I was like oh my
11:06 god how edgy is that little did I know
11:10 that was Steven list burgers company
11:13 little did I know that that dude on the
11:16 screen was the genesis of Tron here's
11:22 how the story goes this is a little bit
11:24 information I don't think is in the DVDs
11:27 it's not secret but you got to know
11:29 these people to get this information so
11:32 buckle up let's Berger Studios operates
11:35 for a number of years in Massachusetts
11:37 but what they kind of figured out was
11:38 that it you know a lot of talents in
11:40 California plus a lot of clients are in
11:42 California it's time to move so they
11:46 picked up everything I don't know
11:47 exactly what year this was I get the
11:49 sense it was about two or three years
11:51 and three or four years and they moved
11:53 everything to Venice Beach now Venice
11:56 Beach has been on TV and movies a lot
11:58 but they usually don't show you is that
12:00 how its laid out because you have this
12:02 beautiful Beach thing now with a bunch
12:03 of homeless people and then they have
12:06 rows of businesses and residents and it
12:08 just keeps going back and it's a kind of
12:10 a thin strip of a of a town very busy
12:13 area but the culture is just blowing up
12:16 down there constantly even if it's bad
12:18 it still has a good culture here and
12:22 there right so they set up and this is
12:24 in the 70s when it was just in its prime
12:26 and they start you know blowing up the
12:30 business it's all great now as soon as
12:34 they got to this location as I have
12:36 heard the story a number of times they
12:38 had this little room like maybe a 10 by
12:41 10 room somewhere like that and they had
12:43 developed this logo character this kind
12:48 of electronic looking character and so
12:52 what they did was when they got bored or
12:54 had a little bit of downtime they would
12:57 draw something and kind of make up the
12:59 story of this character and they would
13:02 go into that room and they post a
13:04 painting on the wall an illustration on
13:06 the wall because everybody was also
13:08 trying to figure out what the hell
13:09 should this look like we're talking
13:11 about something that's in a computer I
13:13 guess right and again the metaphor of
13:16 computer it's not like we didn't have
13:18 computers you know they're in movies but
13:20 they were giant mainframes the terminals
13:22 terminals are really stupid you know
13:24 this we call it dummy terminal they
13:26 don't have any real capabilities it's
13:28 just a wire that prints characters on
13:31 the screen it can't do anything unless
13:32 the mainframe says it can but here comes
13:35 the personal computer apples bringing it
13:37 in Texas Instruments RadioShack all
13:40 kinds of competitor
13:41 but as the story goes it took about five
13:44 years of filling this room with all
13:48 kinds of conceptual art and they would
13:51 sit around and talk about it talk about
13:53 what would this world be what what a
13:55 story be in the middle of this
13:58 electronic world and what's fascinating
14:01 about it is up until that moment they've
14:05 been doing commercials which have left
14:07 30-second stories even animal Olympics
14:09 is a bunch of ala carte funny scenes of
14:13 animals paying in the Olympics right
14:15 I've just seen a little bit of the stuff
14:17 that you get off the DVD but it looked
14:19 phenomenal look Disney quality but
14:24 they're talking and they're talking and
14:25 they're talking and no one's really
14:26 writing anything down except for one
14:28 person
14:30 Peggy let's burger Stephens wife still
14:34 together this day they're like a super
14:36 couple right she starts writing stuff
14:40 down and by the time they get to an idea
14:44 or get to a point where they're like
14:45 okay let's really blow this story out
14:47 she has a white notebook as I've had it
14:51 described to me with about 22 pages of
14:54 notes so if you want to thank one person
14:58 who's never probably been think publicly
14:59 you can think Peggy Liz Berger because
15:02 without her you wouldn't have probably
15:05 every idea that these these animators
15:08 had conceived over the years just the
15:12 insight to do that for me is just a
15:14 stroke of brilliance right because you
15:17 can hear a lot of people talk but for
15:19 you to go you know it's so much it write
15:21 this down I mean that's just a little
15:23 slice of brilliance right so they start
15:27 working on the script Stephen being the
15:31 writer Stephen being the decision-maker
15:35 Stephen adding all of his creativity so
15:39 now they have a concept and they're in
15:41 Los Angeles and for those of you don't
15:43 know you know there's Disneyland eight
15:46 miles for me cuz I always say the Disney
15:48 headquarters is up in Burbank which is
15:51 by North Hollywood
15:54 so they get the script put together they
15:58 go over to Burbank and Steven pitches
16:00 this film now Steven at the time is
16:05 perceived as a prodigy by Disney but he
16:11 pitches this thing and as you've seen in
16:12 the DVDs they said you know the
16:14 president of Disney at the time hadn't
16:17 had any big successes at the time they
16:21 had made like a dozen Herbie Love Bug
16:24 movies and they were looking for
16:25 something new and here's this guy Steven
16:29 who's got this vision and every time he
16:32 describes it they can see it they can't
16:36 necessarily see it when they leave
16:37 because it's so profound living in a
16:40 computer what's the story a programmer
16:42 looking for a missing file that proves
16:44 that he wrote a bunch of videogames that
16:45 the current CEO is stolen meaning he
16:50 claimed that he wrote them he's trying
16:52 to find the file so that he can get
16:54 credit for running the games get the
16:56 profit that he said stolen from him and
16:58 stop running an arcade in Santa Monica
17:00 where his games are making quarters
17:02 instead of him making millions off of
17:05 the actual games themselves right the
17:08 characters Kevin Flynn is played by Jeff
17:11 Bridges Tron's played by boosts Bruce
17:13 box lighter and a whole hot cast of
17:16 other folks that are amazing right David
17:18 Warner place sark and at Dillinger
17:23 senior and lo and behold the perfect
17:27 storm occurs and they greenlight this
17:30 film but you got a little problem on
17:32 your hands okay what do you make this
17:35 movie look like how do you shoot it
17:37 what's it gonna look like you know it's
17:40 a big big question inside of a computer
17:43 well in comes Richard Taylor and this is
17:49 an actual in my opinion you know talk
17:53 about a perfect storm everything was
17:54 perfect storm all the way with a few
17:57 little mishaps which I think actually
17:58 made the film amazing there's only one
18:01 major one and they talk about it and
18:03 DVDs but let's go back into Richard
18:08 richard taylor is in working at abel
18:11 studios he's a gifted special effects
18:13 guy he was a master at controlling light
18:18 he was a master compositor he was able
18:22 to composite through normal processes
18:27 light going through these codeless
18:29 layers of this this plastic painted and
18:35 masked off properly he could make a logo
18:37 look fully 3d like it was in a computer
18:39 but he just painted it with light but
18:43 how did he get that skill well when he
18:47 was in college in the 60s he's liberal
18:49 ER is a liberal arts major back when you
18:53 could really get a career from doing it
18:54 because they really touch it what you
18:56 need to do you practice fine art and he
18:59 could do anything anything okay he and
19:03 his buddies who were touring with the
19:05 Grateful Dead with this light show that
19:07 they had created had figured out how the
19:10 eyeball works now a lot of you have been
19:13 to maybe a laser show at an observatory
19:15 or at least you've heard of it you know
19:17 what it is you know they can shoot
19:19 lasers at mirrors that are spinning they
19:22 could shoot they can project slides what
19:25 Richard and his buddies had done in
19:27 college was to this day for me
19:29 utterly profound and the saddest thing
19:31 is and thus some young students get
19:34 together and try to recreate this none
19:37 of us will ever experience this and it's
19:40 true form what Richard and his friends
19:42 did was figure out how the eyeball
19:47 metabolizes certain colors of light
19:50 meaning you're in the dark you're all
19:53 acclimated to pure black right you can't
19:55 see anything and then poof this this
19:58 slide hits the observatory inner wall
20:01 and if it was red he would stay in your
20:04 retina for a certain amount of time it
20:06 was green different time blue different
20:08 time white different time so he figured
20:12 out all of the principles of how to
20:14 layer in your brain inside your eye
20:17 inside your visual cortex
20:20 images and this is at a time when taking
20:23 acid was very prevalent and it was real
20:26 acid not the stuff to get today that
20:27 might kill you so they would either
20:31 commandeer an observatory or build
20:33 something and they hooked all the slide
20:37 projectors up to keyboards I'm not sure
20:40 if they had lasers or not I feel like
20:43 they didn't because that's a whole
20:45 nother bag of work but they might have
20:48 but they would sit on the outer rim of
20:51 the observatory playing incredible music
20:55 from the Arab and playing on a keyboard
20:59 the exposures from the slide projectors
21:04 and so people would go in and have these
21:06 massive chirps plus the tripping on acid
21:08 at the same time and these folks are
21:10 just layering stuff inside their mind it
21:12 must have been one of the most amazing
21:14 acid trips you could possibly have but
21:19 he masters that first he understands the
21:21 mind he understands the eye he
21:24 understands color he's already a
21:27 massively creative guy you know Richard
21:30 after Tron became a director of some of
21:34 the most famous commercials you've ever
21:36 seen from the 80s to the 90s and he kept
21:39 going like crazy and he and I were the
21:40 ones that put together the first LED 3d
21:44 theater technology a couple years ago if
21:48 you ever see that the genesis was richer
21:51 than myself in LA showing it to
21:54 everybody in Hollywood
21:55 I still consulted this day helping
21:58 people figure out how to do it in
22:00 Hollywood's about ten years behind the
22:02 curve on them so he gets his job a
22:05 tables and starts killing it and
22:08 eventually Richard is introduced to
22:11 Steven for the pure objective of
22:14 figuring out what the inside of this
22:15 computer should look like and Richard
22:18 was like I got this methodology that I
22:22 can take anything that's been filmed in
22:25 black-and-white
22:27 I can reverse it such that every black
22:30 line
22:32 on a person's body or in a set-piece
22:35 like a frisbee will be exposed clear on
22:40 this film thus light can go through and
22:44 everything else is black so it doesn't
22:47 go through so everywhere you want things
22:49 to be lit I can make it happen and so
22:53 they did some tests they did some of
22:54 you've seen it they've done tests with
22:56 the old props from black hole the movie
22:58 made 1978 it was okay but they perfected
23:02 the hell out of it and then of course
23:04 there's the CG that needs to occur the
23:08 computer-generated stuff and so now
23:11 you've got CG programs that are
23:13 absolutely at their infant s amol level
23:16 in terms of generating a model and an
23:19 animation it's all manual there's no 3d
23:22 modeling software that I'm aware of and
23:25 they have to work with primitive shapes
23:27 so spheres cylinders cones very limited
23:33 they could do custom shapes but it's
23:36 very limited so they start putting
23:39 together this crack team to make this
23:40 movie another gentleman with the last
23:44 name Allen Shaw his father was like a
23:46 legendary animator at Disney he's put in
23:49 charge technically at the special
23:50 effects he knows how to get anybody to
23:54 where they're going they have this
23:56 amazing cast and I mean every single
23:58 cast member came to work and blew it
24:01 away so how do they gonna film this
24:04 thing
24:05 some of you know but they dressed all of
24:09 the actors in white leotards you know
24:12 for those of you know the helmet was
24:15 like a hockey helmet leotard was leotard
24:18 with a little piece of cloth down below
24:19 and then the circuitry on the body
24:23 mobius did pretty much the design of the
24:26 body cloth because that was his organic
24:31 expertise and then Sid did the first
24:35 circuitry on the body but Sid me did the
24:39 tanks he did the light cycles mobius did
24:43 the solar sailer
24:45 now Syd also did a solar sailer said
24:49 also did designs for Sark but said stuff
24:52 was so far out there that it was a
24:56 little rough for them to piece it in it
24:59 would have made it really serious I said
25:01 to the i/o tower said that the logo said
25:04 did the number set around the game grid
25:07 but there was so much CG to do in the
25:10 limited amount of time they hired like
25:13 four different companies three big
25:15 companies to do a lot of the animation
25:17 and then their software has to look the
25:19 same you know when they render out
25:21 something you can't look different can't
25:23 move we can't just change colors right
25:26 the fourth company was actually tasked
25:29 with just doing the bit character it
25:31 just said yes and no and how beautiful
25:34 was that thing
25:34 so the codelist technique that was used
25:38 to do tron here's the interesting thing
25:41 about it as you watch this movie every
25:44 frame you see of that film is being
25:48 generated using a technique that had
25:51 never been used before and has never
25:53 been used since it is a one-off
25:56 masterpiece of filmmaking and if you
25:59 knew the difficulty that was involved in
26:05 making one frame I'll tell you the area
26:07 of the film that has the densest layers
26:09 of code Alice was the scene where Flynn
26:14 is about to leave and go back up the
26:17 beam like I'm trying to ruin it for
26:21 anybody hasn't seen it but he kisses
26:23 Yuri and it's that kiss with the mCP
26:27 spending in the background and all the
26:29 beautiful romantic effects around them
26:31 was 28 layers deep of coda lists and
26:34 these codeless frames are about a little
26:37 bit bigger than probably legal paper
26:40 they had to send this stuff off to Japan
26:44 because in order to make the exposures
26:46 look proper someone had to mask off the
26:49 eyeballs and the teeth so they had
26:51 artists you know painting around
26:53 eyeballs and teeth all day long and I
26:55 mean every frame of this movie at least
26:58 24 frames
27:00 anytime they're in the computer that's
27:02 what's going on the the actor that I
27:06 think he said the actor that played Ram
27:08 I met one time great guy he also played
27:11 a Ferengi was probably the best
27:13 Frankie's I've ever seen but he said
27:16 that he actually met the artist who said
27:17 you know what I you're that you know
27:19 that do the played Ram and he's like
27:20 yeah and he goes I have painted your
27:22 nose for like months and months and
27:24 months
27:24 I do mascot your nose every single time
27:27 that came around now here's the
27:30 interesting thing so I'm I'm gonna take
27:32 it my little personal journey here we'll
27:34 get back to the film in a second but
27:37 this is how crazy my life is in terms of
27:39 meeting my heroes and getting that work
27:42 with them right so guys I've told you
27:45 that story several times that I was
27:49 taught by my uncle on how to draw on a
27:51 computer using binary blocks that the
27:53 tab and then the next year I see this
27:56 movie Tron and the way it went down was
28:00 I went back cuz I would always visit my
28:02 mom for about a month in Kansas and go
28:03 back to live in Massachusetts that only
28:05 went on for a couple of years but I'm in
28:08 Massachusetts my dad was in the military
28:10 so I'm on a military base I'm inside the
28:14 PX and we're just shopping for our stuff
28:17 for the month and there was a Tron
28:18 bumper sticker just in a big pile
28:21 somewhere in an ink cap and it was SIDS
28:23 logo now little did I know that when I
28:26 watched Star Trek the motion picture
28:28 both Richard and Sid worked on that film
28:31 as well before Doug Trumbull pushed at
28:34 40 million dollars over budget so I'm
28:37 looking at this logo and it's just so
28:38 cool but I have no idea what Tron is and
28:41 I have no idea what the movie is I've
28:43 never seen a trailer for it but I grab
28:45 the bumper sticker no idea where that
28:47 thing went and so by time I went back to
28:50 Kansas to visit my mom there was a
28:52 weekend where she just goes what would
28:53 you like to do and I said I heard this
28:55 movie Tron Follies in the theaters can I
28:57 go see it and she goes yeah sure so we
29:01 go down to this
29:01 I think it's called Twin Peaks theaters
29:03 across from the Townies Mall Wichita
29:05 Kansas on Rock Road and I said there's a
29:08 teeny tiny theater and this movie comes
29:12 on
29:13 and I will tell you because of the very
29:15 opening scene you get to see clue inside
29:18 the computer driving a tank being chased
29:19 by recognizers and we'll get back to
29:22 that in a second and I'm on the edge of
29:25 my seat my mind is being blown second to
29:30 second the story is accessible from my
29:33 mind I don't anything about computers
29:35 really the designs the organic mobius
29:40 designs the industrial sid designs I
29:44 mean the inside of the tank alone is
29:46 just a marvel plus it did this Solar
29:49 started to sark's carrier and we'll get
29:52 back to that and so I go home and I'm on
29:57 cloud nine I'm at my mom's place and I'm
30:00 just like oh my god Tron Tron Tron Tron
30:01 Tron so next day comes around this was a
30:04 very rare thing for me in the 70s my
30:07 mom's like what do you want to do today
30:08 and I said you honestly want to know
30:11 what I want to do I want to go see that
30:12 movie again and I'm 12 just about to go
30:17 on 13 she goes okay to my utter surprise
30:21 she takes me back down to the same
30:23 theater she goes look I don't want to
30:24 see it again
30:25 so I'll just come pick you up I'm gonna
30:26 go across the street and shop a little
30:28 bit so now I'm able to ingest this film
30:31 all by myself
30:32 theaters fairly full for a Sunday
30:37 afternoon and I I have to say when they
30:41 say you want to write a movie that keeps
30:43 the audience on the edge of their seat I
30:44 was literally finding myself on the edge
30:47 of my seat just couldn't get close
30:49 enough to the screen when it came around
30:52 it was just the sounds the music by
30:54 Wendy Carlos the animations that designs
30:57 the script the characters everything I
31:00 was just beside myself you know and what
31:04 what was interesting about it was it was
31:07 utterly inspiring to me the designs were
31:10 inspiring to me I wanted to get into
31:12 computers so bad after that it was
31:14 ridiculous and I was unbeknownst to me I
31:17 was about to move back to Kansas and get
31:19 access to my first computer a junior
31:21 high Massachusetts had eight old black
31:24 Apple
31:26 one or two I don't know which one it was
31:28 a little cassette player
31:29 you know kids weren't allowed to touch
31:31 it we were so in grade school so there's
31:34 this this moment where it touched my
31:37 life now here's the thing when I come
31:39 back I get into computers I get into
31:41 video game programming at like 12 13
31:44 Vegas 13 sorry baby 13 when I really
31:47 launched off on it I'm creating Tron
31:49 games I am slowing down every single
31:51 frame in this movie
31:52 tracing everything out on the 8 by 10
31:54 graph paper rastering izing restaurant
31:58 everything drawing in the computer I got
32:00 this couple programs which allowed me to
32:02 turn them into sprites I could load them
32:03 up and animate them and I didn't really
32:06 have a game but I had a you know the
32:07 ability to throw a disc and it looked
32:09 awesome you know because in television
32:11 you said these little characters running
32:12 on the side you know my stuff was like
32:15 full-body you know it was really cool so
32:17 I learned a lot at the same time I'm
32:19 doing all this another kind of
32:22 correlation and then we'll get back to
32:24 the film itself when I said I worked at
32:28 the pharmaceutical company in Palo Alto
32:31 the building I was in was because the
32:34 pharmaceutical companies but those of
32:36 you don't know it looks like college
32:37 campuses buildings everywhere and you
32:39 got drug over there and drug over there
32:40 and I was in this annex building for all
32:43 the engineers right I was on my own
32:44 little top-secret project with one other
32:47 guy that was working on other stuff he
32:48 was double blinded and so someone
32:53 finally took me outside one day and said
32:55 see a building right next door I said
32:57 yeah and he goes that's the Xerox
32:59 Building I said okay great
33:03 he said no you don't understand because
33:05 that's the Xerox Building so what are
33:08 you talking about he goes that's where
33:09 the mouse was invented the laser writer
33:11 and the GUI right there in that building
33:14 he goes with Steve Jobs came to Xerox to
33:17 see the GUI in the late 70s that's the
33:21 building he walked into you know I got a
33:23 chance to work with that guy and all of
33:24 his you know top brass for jeez three or
33:28 four years straight but little did I
33:31 know that Steven who went into that same
33:34 building to see a bunch of stuff from
33:37 the guy named Alan
33:39 his last name but he's the big zeroes
33:41 guy which is why Tron's username is Alan
33:46 because of the Xerox dude a mountain and
33:48 his wife also worked on the film will
33:52 talk about her in a second so I had I
33:57 had no idea that Mobius had done the
34:00 other half of this thing even though I
34:02 was a heavy metal kid the movie heavy
34:04 metal which I believe was 1981 there was
34:07 a heavy metal magazine in the UK which I
34:09 was unaware of because it was sort of a
34:11 an adult fantasy magazine and what that
34:15 really means is if there was some woman
34:20 they'd be topless here and there right
34:22 it's a shame we have such a version to
34:25 the human body but you know was like
34:27 Conan type stories and all kinds of
34:29 stuff that Mobius would draw Sid
34:32 meanwhile is this prodigy kid at Ford
34:35 Motors for a couple of years he went to
34:38 Art Center in Pasadena he ends up
34:40 popping out starting his own company he
34:43 is doing industrial design for or he's
34:47 doing actually artistic designs for US
34:49 Steel so the US Steel series of CID
34:52 stuff is some of the most sought-after
34:53 work on planet Earth I recently watched
34:56 for the very first time a Star Wars
34:59 making of thing on YouTube which was
35:02 phenomenal because it was like someone
35:03 ripped the DVD and just put it online
35:05 and no one scratched it off so far but
35:09 the gentleman who did the first designs
35:11 of the at-at Walker
35:12 I had thought for years that he had
35:16 ripped off Syd Mead and never gave
35:18 credit and I the reason why I thought
35:21 that was I'd never seen an interview
35:22 with the guy saw an interview with Phil
35:24 Tippett who said this other dude
35:25 designed the at-at Walker and of course
35:27 I put it together - a friend of mine -
35:29 the engineering on it but the truth of
35:32 matter is the gentleman who did the
35:33 at-at Walker I just watched him he goes
35:36 well you know the at-at Walker was based
35:38 on on a painting by Syd Mead and he cuz
35:41 I even called Syd and said is it ok if I
35:44 use generally the design because he said
35:47 did the feet and the legs in this snow
35:50 crawler thing
35:52 and so said inspired the otter walker
35:55 so CID has worked on at this point the
36:01 Star Trek motion picture that was
36:03 released in 1979 his very first movie
36:05 ever worked on and then in two year
36:07 period he worked on Tron doing half of
36:10 the art and then Blade Runner he
36:12 probably did about 90% of the art and
36:14 the other 10% is like Deckard's gun was
36:17 a different person and of course all of
36:20 the other kind of shots keys and logos
36:22 and things but Sid did just a ton of
36:25 that movie so Sid hits two home runs in
36:30 1982 however both movies were panned by
36:33 the critics Tron releases in August and
36:38 Blade Runner releases in December now
36:42 the truth of story is is that Tron was
36:44 supposed to release at December as well
36:47 which I don't think would have affected
36:49 later on at all but what happened was
36:51 some artists had left Disney started
36:56 their own company and he created some
36:57 weird bear movie and they had released
36:59 the fact that they were gonna release
37:00 their movie in August and so the head of
37:02 the studio which had switched
37:04 was angry at them and had Tron pulled
37:07 and put right on top of the weekend of
37:09 their movie and their movie tanked may
37:12 have tanked anyway who knows right so
37:14 there are some people to feel like the
37:16 movie lost some of the ideas that they
37:20 had had for the film but I will tell you
37:23 that most the top brass don't agree with
37:25 that they think the film came out
37:26 exactly the way they wanted to
37:27 so that warms my heart that we didn't
37:30 miss something the only cutscene from
37:32 the entire movie that I'm aware of is
37:34 that seeing that you can get on the DVDs
37:37 which is at one point the movies just
37:39 boom boom boom boom boom and then there
37:41 was a visit I think it was covered in
37:43 Flynn went to URIs place but it might
37:46 have been Tron can't remember and she
37:48 like gets in this wild robe you know and
37:52 it sort of has the Genesis with some of
37:55 the work that Richard Taylor had done in
37:56 the 70s for the 7up franchise he had one
38:00 tremendous awards in the 70s for doing
38:04 these incredible
38:05 7-up commercials if you want to see them
38:07 just like a Prichard to your tailor
38:09 designed calm and it's a site I've
38:11 maintained for Richard and it's up there
38:13 in the commercials in the 70s section or
38:16 you can just look it up and then when
38:18 the just as a finisher on that when the
38:22 little spot character 3d spot character
38:25 came out in the 80s and 90s
38:27 Richard directed all those as well when
38:30 you see this woman in this 7up
38:32 commercial kind of flying in this kind
38:37 of butterfly cape with all these crazy
38:39 sequins and stars on them and then you
38:41 look at your ease outfit very similar
38:43 very similar deed but there were some
38:47 interesting things about the film that I
38:50 think have been recorded but I'm just
38:52 gonna repeat a mirror which is that the
38:54 3d software was not capable of doing the
38:57 original design of the light cycle thats
38:59 it came up with this light cycle you see
39:01 and legacy was everything Sid had put in
39:06 there with a bunch of other interesting
39:08 little tidbits that says original design
39:11 for the light cycle which may look silly
39:13 to you today the boy and 82 man it was a
39:16 mind blower especially was in 3d which
39:18 we'd never seen that before ever okay
39:21 Tron 1982 here's your first CG film and
39:25 it's quite frankly it's your first CG
39:27 film with live action mixed with it
39:31 which we'll get back to in a second but
39:34 Sid's outfit design was he called it the
39:37 lobster design when light cycle driver
39:41 would lean down into the bike just like
39:43 a legacy they complete the curve of the
39:45 bike but they couldn't do that in 82 so
39:48 he had to go back and re-engineer it
39:50 with an enclosure over it
39:51 and that's how you see it in the film
39:54 but one of the big things I didn't know
39:56 for years was that the CG software back
40:00 in the day didn't do shading in the way
40:04 that we do it today in a way it's in
40:06 every single product out there meaning
40:07 you have a floor and a light source and
40:11 of course as the light source starts to
40:13 die off the floor is going to get darker
40:15 and darker and darker as it goes off in
40:16 the distance where their very first
40:19 renders came back and they realized that
40:22 the grid was led all the way to the edge
40:24 of the you know far off distance and so
40:27 they actually engineered the shaders to
40:29 make sure that the ground was shaded and
40:31 looked proper it's a very interesting
40:33 where things get innovated right the
40:37 other thing was the process of doing
40:39 this another friend of mine I guess I
40:42 could say bill Cruyff who teaches at
40:45 Chapman University Richard Taylor and I
40:48 taught the first accredited VR class at
40:50 Chapman together he was one of the many
40:55 folks that had to transport numbers from
40:59 a computer upstairs at his annex
41:02 building at Disney when they wanted to
41:04 do animations one you've got this model
41:07 that's in memory and that's what the the
41:10 firm on the East Coast at least one of
41:12 the companies already had that a memory
41:14 but anytime they needed to animate
41:17 something they had to calculate
41:19 everything inside this calculation
41:22 software like a program that basically
41:24 bar from numbers if you think about
41:25 animation you've got sort of your your
41:29 time so you have this T and then you
41:32 have X Y Z where is it gonna be
41:34 physically the model right in 3d space
41:37 but then you've got roll pitch and yaw
41:39 so all of its behavior on a spindle plus
41:43 if any element of the actual object is
41:45 going to move separately that's got to
41:47 be on its own algorithm so bill with a
41:51 group of folks would type all this stuff
41:54 in get it all calculated out print it
41:57 out on one of those old dot-matrix
41:59 printers carry that downstairs to
42:01 another piece of software running on a
42:03 computer with a modem all the way to the
42:05 east coast and how the other studios he
42:08 type every single number in and if you
42:11 made any mistakes the animation failed
42:13 and of course it takes a while back in
42:15 the day to get an animation frame back
42:17 and so they have some funny animation
42:21 bloopers where the recognizer is
42:23 actually popping out this pit and
42:25 driving off now the recognizer design is
42:28 interesting because it's neither mobius
42:29 or sid it was some of the surface
42:32 iving designs from Liz Berger studios
42:34 and it was built off of this original
42:37 character that was going to be tron
42:38 which was a very kind of geometric
42:42 looking character that was kind of look
42:43 like a big football player so a lot of
42:46 you know this but if you don't you look
42:48 at the recognizer his head it looks like
42:50 a big jaw of like a big heavy football
42:53 player with the big neck and of course
42:55 the shoulders where the outer part of
42:57 the recognizer I'm gonna say this
43:00 because a lot of folks don't know I run
43:02 into plenty all the time people will
43:05 eventually ask me like what's recognizer
43:07 what is it that named me it's in the
43:09 very first scene in the movie or clue is
43:12 looking for this file and he's driving
43:14 around but he gets he gets chased by
43:16 recognizers they're recognizing things
43:19 in the system and then vetting them it's
43:21 like an immune system and one of the
43:24 saddest things that ever happened for
43:26 legacy which I should probably wait till
43:27 we just make the full transition was
43:30 that they turned the recognizers from an
43:32 enemy that had some consciousness into a
43:35 basically a Greyhound bus and legacy
43:38 talk about writers that don't get the
43:40 original movie absolutely absurd amount
43:44 of tension and villainous behavior that
43:47 they just flushed down the toilet when
43:50 they made this thing a vehicle you just
43:52 ride on it's okay to ride on the thing
43:54 but make it have its own AI when I wrote
43:57 my version of Tron 3 which you can find
43:58 on the Facebook LOX Facebook page for
44:01 deep thoughts look under files they're
44:05 back to being bad guys so then the last
44:08 question I finally got answered at a
44:11 party which was enable enables party in
44:14 San Diego was I always wondered how were
44:21 they able to get something rendered in a
44:24 computer onto film because there's no
44:28 mechanism at the time to get it onto
44:30 film today they could print it to film
44:33 but everything is digital today there's
44:35 no film so it's easy today
44:37 so I finally put these guys down i prin
44:40 Richard down to and I said how did you
44:41 do this and Richard was the one that
44:45 actually answered it for me so
44:46 we had this super high-res monitor
44:50 because what we did was we would we
44:53 built this office that was completely
44:55 blocked out from any windows son of any
44:57 kind and then we took the camera and the
45:00 TV and draped them in a couple layers of
45:03 black so there was no spectral
45:05 highlighting whatsoever from any of the
45:07 surfaces and they filmed a television
45:12 and just advanced frames and filmed the
45:14 television how brilliant how amazing now
45:19 for some of you the if you ever see clue
45:23 get killed in the very first scene
45:26 there's this wild pixelization that
45:29 happens when the guards poked Kevin
45:32 Flynn to get him to move after he gets
45:34 in the computer there's this crazy
45:37 pixelization that happens on the camera
45:39 in the camera and the way they did that
45:41 was they took very fine chicken wire and
45:44 spun it in front of the camera lens and
45:46 it creates this pixelated effect right
45:50 it's like the old quantum quantum
45:53 mechanics like slit-lamp thing but the
45:57 film comes out and it you know you
46:00 either jumped on board and it became a
46:02 religious experience which obviously
46:03 millions of people had that experience
46:05 or it never amounted to anything in your
46:09 mind or it grew on you over time if
46:14 you're a big fan of legacy and you've
46:16 never seen the first film do yourself a
46:18 favor and go watch it you'll understand
46:21 everything about Kevin Flynn but there
46:25 is I believe his name is John Seely he
46:29 is someone that we owe a huge gratitude
46:34 of thanks to so the studio had changed
46:38 the movie came out didn't make you know
46:41 hundreds of millions of dollars it
46:44 definitely made back its money and made
46:46 a profit so no problem there but you
46:49 know sometimes things don't make the
46:51 kind of money that you want them to and
46:53 so he ordered the film to be destroyed
46:58 all those co2
47:00 prints right it was big clear piece of
47:02 CODIS
47:03 I mean literally this is a one-of-a-kind
47:05 thing this is like there was only one
47:07 Faberge egg ever made and some guy says
47:10 break it get rid of that I want to see
47:12 this thing again so Wow pick a word
47:15 calling that name because that's what he
47:17 was right so this poor worker has no
47:21 idea what he's doing has his barrel full
47:24 of fire and he's throwing this Cutlass
47:26 into the barrel then Schiele comes
47:29 around the corner I mean almost like in
47:32 some divine intervention situation and
47:35 notices that that looks familiar I'm
47:38 just paraphrasing what I think happened
47:40 there but he walks up to the guy and
47:42 he's like what are you doing he's like
47:43 well I've been told to burn all this and
47:46 he says well don't stop burning things
47:49 here's my car bring everything he can
47:52 over here and I'm just gonna take it
47:54 away you don't have to burn it ok
47:57 because I worked on this film this is my
47:59 stuff you know with all my buddies and
48:00 everybody involved right so he ends up
48:03 saving thousands and thousands of these
48:06 codelist prints and now there's some of
48:08 the most sought-after pieces of
48:09 Hollywood you'll ever find I was at a
48:12 really endearing dinner once at Tommy
48:14 Teller Rico's house who's a video game
48:17 music God and he had invited over
48:21 Stephen and his wife and Richard his
48:26 girlfriend and I came along and he
48:29 pulled out a bunch of these colas and
48:30 he's like picketing when you won and
48:33 they got takes him home super cool right
48:35 Thank You Tommy
48:36 by the way Tommy's got a show that you
48:39 probably should go see where he
48:42 recreates all of this videogame music
48:45 using an orchestra using a band and
48:48 there's actually a lot of interactive
48:50 things to pull people in the audience
48:52 they could play video games by running
48:53 around the stage is super cool so
48:55 definitely look him up and he's
48:56 rebirthing hopefully he succeeds the
48:59 Intellivision I have no idea exactly
49:01 what he's doing there but that's that's
49:04 part of his magic but the cool thing
49:08 about this film once you get inside the
49:11 computer I mean everything is great
49:13 they actually had some great soundtrack
49:16 stuff they did the I believe the sound
49:18 the journey song that's at the bottom at
49:20 the end of the movie what the credits
49:21 was actually written for the film so
49:23 that's cool but you have kids like me
49:26 who are all malleable in the brain right
49:28 I'm ready for anything right and this
49:30 movie taught me principles the bit a
49:34 positive and a negative what a cute
49:37 little character you know just said yes
49:38 no and you know clue would talk to it
49:41 and then eventually it latched on to
49:43 Kevin Flynn inside the computer which
49:45 was awesome but so you're learning about
49:48 memory you're learning about all kinds
49:50 of stuff the i/o tower part of the
49:55 computer the computer communicates with
49:56 the outside world
49:57 it's where Tron went to communicate with
50:00 Alan his user now the other part about
50:03 the film that it would be interesting to
50:07 see if you were to submit the transcript
50:09 today to any modern studio whether or
50:11 not they would accept this or not
50:12 there's sort of this feeling in the
50:16 writing community in Hollywood that if
50:17 you were to bring Star Wars one it never
50:20 been made and you bring it to a studio
50:22 today they would say something to the
50:24 effect of well you know I like this film
50:27 what's this for scrap get rid of the for
50:29 scrap it means that's sort of the
50:31 mentality of a lot of the people without
50:33 any film degrees that are running these
50:34 studios but one of the brilliant things
50:37 about the thumb if you haven't seen it
50:40 especially with Steven created this
50:43 amazing metaphor between programmers us
50:47 and the outside world and the programs
50:51 inside the world inside the computer
50:54 itself right your program looks exactly
50:57 like you and so the actors that played
50:59 the the program in the outside world
51:01 would play the program on the inside of
51:03 the world if you pay attention both Tron
51:06 or both excuse me yeah both drama and
51:09 RAM are portrayed in the first few
51:12 scenes of the first act with Alan and I
51:15 forget the RAM guy's name but he asked
51:18 if he's gonna eat all this popcorn or
51:20 something like this things I don't take
51:21 it you know and so you see those two
51:23 guys inside the computer and you see
51:24 their programs
51:25 now inside the computer they refer to
51:29 the programmers as users and not in the
51:34 derogatory sense but in the sense of a
51:36 god the users I have a user and that's
51:41 how they refer to their maker and so
51:43 there was this relationship between the
51:45 divine user / God made them now
51:50 obviously in their own image I mean how
51:51 cool is that right and what was going on
51:55 in the computer because there was a
51:56 renegade artificial intelligence called
51:58 the master control program which was
52:01 actually a face that Richard Taylor had
52:03 created for Abel and associates and they
52:06 actually taken his face off this guy he
52:07 juggled and they stretched it out and
52:10 flattened it out to make the MCPS face
52:15 the mCP was taking over the computer
52:18 inside and getting rid of this religion
52:20 which was the users the guys in charge
52:24 know the users exist but they don't like
52:27 the fact that they don't have control
52:28 sound familiar so inside this computer
52:33 you have blue guys and you got red guys
52:35 the red guys are the ones trying to be
52:37 the ruling class of the computer they
52:41 don't want anything interfering with
52:42 their system of control and yet the blue
52:46 guys they're holding out for the users
52:48 but they're being persecuted for being
52:52 believers in the users and so they're
52:54 put into games where they eventually get
52:58 killed and the name of the game is
53:01 you're going to be in games until you
53:02 die but here comes a user into the
53:06 system played by Jeff Bridges
53:08 brilliantly played by Jeff Bridges and
53:10 he plays Flynn which is his last name
53:16 but he is a user and eventually they
53:18 figured out and this is one of the big I
53:22 think miscarriages of justice with Tron
53:25 Legacy the second that Sam Flynn gets in
53:28 the computer he's paraded in front of
53:30 everybody in the first act this is a
53:31 user boo
53:33 right this is the equivalent in our
53:37 world of someone saying this
53:39 God and you actually think it's God V
53:42 God the one gun and then you go boo
53:45 would never happen ever ever ever in the
53:49 Tron Legacy world they'd probably be
53:51 like oh [ __ ] okay
53:53 now what you know flush down the drain
53:56 you barely get any user program
53:59 references at all and legacy again
54:01 that's why we think that if you
54:03 submitted this group today they'd say
54:06 this is a great script to get rid of
54:07 this user program crap we've got to gut
54:11 the heart of the story now the other
54:14 thing that makes the film utterly
54:16 amazing besides the design which I'll do
54:19 a little brief on that before we
54:21 completely quit here is that when the
54:24 actors showed up to work they took it
54:26 seriously and as Bruce box later said he
54:30 was playing a cowboy in some television
54:32 show and they gave him the script to
54:34 this Tron thing well he's on a horse and
54:37 so he's in this Western world reading
54:39 about this computerized world again no
54:42 one had any reference for computers
54:44 right if you were an average Joe you had
54:47 no idea what memory was our driver there
54:49 wasn't any hard drives what a floppy
54:51 disk was I mean you didn't know you
54:53 didn't just kind of know you totally
54:55 didn't know and so Bruce I think as the
54:58 story goes past on it initially and then
55:03 eventually when he heard I think Jeff
55:05 Bridges joining the program he was like
55:07 all right if Jeff's gonna take it and
55:09 I'll take it and thank God I mean we oh
55:12 Jeff Bridges a huge debt of gratitude
55:14 not only for how he portrayed this
55:16 character Kevin Flynn but he got the
55:20 whole thing going but any of you've seen
55:22 the first scene of the film where clew
55:24 gets captured and then eventually killed
55:26 very quickly Jeff Bridges does a screen
55:31 it has two screams one he is thrown
55:34 across the room and slams against a wall
55:36 and he he shudders at the pain now
55:40 obviously the actor in my life is in no
55:41 pain but Jeff is a magician he's a
55:46 magician actor and then after being
55:49 interrogated very quickly by the mCP and
55:51 he won't give up anything because he's a
55:52 true blue
55:53 program that won't turn in his user the
55:57 mCP seemingly overcharges his circuits
56:00 and burns him out and Kevin Flynn lets
56:05 out this cry and from the moment he hits
56:09 the wall he yells so hard that in real
56:11 life a tear starts to pop out of his eye
56:13 and when he dies it's just sobering
56:19 you're like oh I thought I was seeing a
56:21 little kiddie movie made by Walt
56:23 Disney's production and by the time Jeff
56:26 screams and dies in that clue character
56:29 you're just like whoa this is gonna be a
56:32 hell of a ride in of course the movie
56:35 delivers tenfold
56:37 but everyone showed up for work and that
56:42 makes the movie what it is look at David
56:44 Warner David Warner classically trained
56:49 British actor it's again I struggle to
56:56 figure out what would make someone like
56:59 David Warner take the production aside
57:02 from a paycheck he was never gonna be in
57:04 any problems of getting gigs it was
57:06 Disney maybe that's something that kind
57:08 of toppled it over but he must have seen
57:10 something in the script because David
57:13 Warner plays one mean mofo in his movie
57:15 from being the executive on the outside
57:18 to being sarcone the inside he is one of
57:23 the very first scenes that once Flynn
57:26 gets in the computer and I'm gonna sort
57:29 of bounce around the story so I don't
57:31 ruin anything for anyone hasn't seen it
57:32 but there's a scene where obviously our
57:35 main character survives the first
57:36 engagement that he's put in the first
57:38 game he's put in and the SARC wants to
57:44 kill him because he wins he doesn't he's
57:46 afraid of him first first and foremost
57:48 because MCP comes to Sarkozy I'm gonna
57:50 bring you a user he's like what things
57:53 like yeah I want you to you know give
57:56 him the standard treatment I want him in
57:58 the games until he dies playing but even
58:01 Sark's like oh wait a minute he's a user
58:03 I mean users bait us
58:05 he's like I don't know if I can kill
58:06 those guys he said he's got an MCP just
58:10 like so arrogant he's like you want me
58:12 to slow down your power cycles pull
58:16 yourself together
58:16 you know and your Sark is like okay
58:18 goddamn this could kill me you know but
58:20 there's a point where Sark hits this
58:23 button david warner because mCP won't
58:27 let him kill him so he's got to release
58:28 him and then there's just all this
58:30 amazing powerful drama in this movie it
58:32 is not a kiddie film it appeals to
58:36 children for a million different reasons
58:38 but this film is serious business which
58:41 is why it's stan stood the test of time
58:43 in in part right but the same time it's
58:48 playful and has some humor in it and
58:50 it's just cool it's just super cool the
58:52 soundtrack that Wendy Carlos put
58:54 together who did Clockwork Orange as
58:56 well and as I'm told
58:59 Disney selects your music for you
59:02 typically and so Steven had no no saying
59:05 it yeah but when he showed up for work
59:09 man
59:09 blew it out very patented you know
59:15 soundtrack let's talk about a couple
59:18 things in design let's talk about the
59:19 Sark carrier and then the solar sailer
59:22 for one second let's do the solar sailer
59:25 first so Sid did a solar sailer and it's
59:29 very wild it's it's nothing like
59:31 anything else they did for the film
59:32 because it's very organic and beautiful
59:34 and Sid can totally do organic the dude
59:36 paints photographs okay and when he
59:39 paints in these French gouache
59:41 watercolors and collage is different
59:43 than any watercolors we had as children
59:45 you could paint the whole canvas black
59:48 with quash let it dry which is a few
59:50 minutes later and then get a single hair
59:53 on a brush with pure white and just
59:56 paint a white line and it shows up
59:58 perfectly that squash and sit as a said
60:03 honestly speaking I think without
60:06 exaggerating in the slightest I'll show
60:09 you some pictures here while I'm talking
60:12 Sid has got to be in the history of the
60:16 world of all human beings that have ever
60:18 been
60:19 and died or whatever he is the master of
60:23 gouache painting the top of the world
60:26 the top to ever exist
60:28 okay but when they looked at the solar
60:31 sailer what was very interesting about
60:32 the solar sailer exercises you have sid
60:35 going very organic and mobius going back
60:38 towards the more digital looking design
60:41 and so they eventually picked mobius as
60:43 design but there was a catch with mobius
60:46 as design i think it was stephen that
60:51 really pushed hard he wanted the sails
60:53 on his butterfly wing thing to be
60:56 transparent so light would go through it
60:59 well remember this is at the beginning
61:01 of cg artwork and so they don't have an
61:05 algorithm they can allow light to pass
61:07 through a surface add the surface of
61:10 whatever is being lightly visible to the
61:12 color range and then going to the camera
61:14 and so they invented that for the movie
61:18 and that became something that was in
61:20 obviously pics our libraries later on
61:22 now the star carrier is I mean
61:25 everything is phenomenal everything is
61:27 amazing
61:28 but when Sid did with the star carrier
61:30 and I've seen his original sketches for
61:32 this he what he does is he draws like a
61:35 thousand little drawings before he
61:37 figures out what to do in the end and it
61:38 starts to getting close pretty quickly
61:40 but he you know Steve's drawn and drawn
61:42 so you just drew a ton of aircraft
61:44 carriers just kind of get the DNA down
61:46 figure out what it was and so this is
61:48 the way SIDS mind works if you've seen
61:50 all my episodes I always encourage you
61:52 to think like Sid because I call it the
61:54 90 degree turn now and our view our
61:59 consciousness if I said thinkin a 90
62:01 degree turn you would start looking that
62:02 way right and you'd see something in
62:04 your peripheral vision you never saw
62:06 before and it will add to your
62:07 enlightenment and get you to where you
62:09 need to go especially if you're being
62:10 creative but what I where I got that
62:12 from that statement was watching Sid
62:16 design Sark's carrier he took one
62:19 carrier and then put its normal
62:23 orientation and then he took another
62:25 character and turned it 90 degrees
62:27 include it to the first one and he took
62:30 the command station that would have been
62:31 on the top
62:32 and and detached it and stuck it on the
62:35 side of the one that's on the side up
62:38 right so when you walked you would be in
62:40 the right orientation it is one of the
62:41 most beautiful vehicles ever designed
62:44 and I don't care if you're talking about
62:46 stuff designed today it's utterly
62:48 brilliant so the last piece of trivia on
62:53 this film is a piece of trivia I'm just
62:58 gonna make it my little private project
63:00 from time to time I revealed it once in
63:02 some episode I can't remember which one
63:04 it was
63:06 this might even make a few people angry
63:08 they were friends of mine but here's the
63:12 thing I'm not gonna reveal anybody's
63:16 name but I'll say this the film was
63:18 written by one person it was written by
63:23 one person you wikipedia'd there's two
63:25 names up there the reason why there's
63:27 two names up there is that the other
63:30 person's name which I think you can
63:32 deduce was simply asked over a telephone
63:35 call to copyright the script because
63:38 they had finished it and locked it and
63:40 they forgot to send it off to the
63:41 Writers Guild of America to get it
63:43 copyrighted and protected and that
63:46 person in the process of taking it down
63:49 to the WGA wrote their name on it as a
63:52 co-writer and boom this person gets
63:56 credit for writing half of Tron now that
63:59 this person contributed like anyone else
64:00 does to a script sure but I write movies
64:04 for a living and let me tell you you
64:06 know I'll talk to buddies of mine and
64:07 they'll come up with an idea and I'm
64:10 really hot on it for a little while and
64:11 sometimes it makes it to the end result
64:13 most the time it doesn't because people
64:16 in working for don't like the idea or I
64:18 personally tuned it out because it
64:20 doesn't work but this person goes to
64:22 like you know panels and talks about how
64:25 they wrote Tron and I just need to
64:28 remove that credit talk about how you
64:31 participated to talk about what you did
64:32 put in the film but you didn't write any
64:34 dialogue you didn't write any action you
64:36 didn't write the film it's a huge
64:38 difference than sitting next to a genius
64:40 you know it's like sitting next to
64:42 someone like Leonardo and going hey you
64:45 know
64:45 you should make that Bush a little
64:47 greener I painted half the Mona Lisa
64:50 the gall of some human beings let's just
64:53 put that way so legacy let's just I got
64:57 some time on the stake here let's talk
64:58 about legacy a little bit the most
65:01 interesting thing about legacy for me is
65:02 that out of everyone who tells me they
65:05 love the movie and this has been one for
65:08 one since the movie came out in 2010
65:11 I've been to Disneyland electronica oh
65:14 by the way before I totally jump off on
65:17 that the reason why it's called Tron and
65:19 this is in the making of DVDs I believe
65:22 but this is the true story some people
65:24 debate whether or not this is true
65:26 Stephen simply looked inside the word
65:29 electronic and took out Tron out of the
65:31 word electronic and that's how we got
65:33 his name but here's the interesting
65:34 trivia about the word Tron when I start
65:38 programming mega heavy in the mid 80s
65:40 the computer that I owned had a command
65:43 called Tron and it stands for trace on
65:47 and what's super ironic about that is
65:50 that the program Tron in the movie is a
65:54 program that hadn't been officially
65:56 turned on inside the master control
65:58 programs you know domain which is this
66:01 inner world but what it was supposed to
66:03 do was supposed to track programs that
66:05 were running that weren't supposed to be
66:06 running and shut them down so like just
66:08 security software but the program
66:12 command by the mid 80s was Treece on
66:16 well what is Tron doing Tron is tracing
66:20 it's not the same exact thing as a
66:22 tracing code is a little different but
66:23 Tron is actually tracking what's running
66:25 it's sort of interesting so I got a
66:27 similar play on words but that's where
66:29 it comes from but when I asked anybody
66:32 about Tron Legacy I say look you loved
66:35 the movie right
66:36 I meant Disneyland with 3,000 kids
66:38 running around in suits they made
66:39 themselves that are glowing just
66:41 beautiful electronica was the greatest
66:44 thing that California Park has ever had
66:46 and they blew it by turkey turning it
66:51 off they should that should just be a
66:52 year-round thing going to the Tron world
66:54 right there and right now that area of
66:56 the park is totally dead
66:58 this is stupid it's just how people make
67:01 bad decisions is beyond me right it said
67:06 they just raised the ticket prices to a
67:07 $1100 for a season pass the old
67:10 restrictions and parking used to be 375
67:12 just ten years ago okay I asked the kids
67:17 what was the movie about even grown
67:20 adults in their late 30s look at me and
67:23 go well I don't really remember what the
67:25 movie was about I just thought it was
67:27 cool Wow
67:30 so there's actually a little miracle
67:32 going on here you like a movie but you
67:35 can't remember what it's about a guy
67:39 went into a computer that's about all I
67:40 remember right ha
67:42 interesting so the script is pardon my
67:45 review so bad
67:48 that no one can remember it at all I've
67:51 never had a kid pull up a single thing
67:54 in fact the kids at Disneyland the most
67:57 common answer was they didn't they say
67:59 that same thing I don't remember what
68:01 the script is about but I thought it
68:02 looked cool and it sounded cool
68:04 aha those are the two gems of legacy so
68:10 one day I'm eating lunch with Stephen
68:10 and we had heard that this movie got
68:12 greenlit of course he's deeply involved
68:14 with it
68:15 he's actually in the movie as the
68:16 bartender we're gonna eat lunch with he
68:19 and his son and it came down to Daft
68:22 Punk was doing the soundtrack and I was
68:26 a fairly decent deaf punk fan I mean I
68:28 didn't follow him everything that they
68:29 did and all that stuff but I was
68:30 definitely a fan of their music but I
68:32 had been pitching Daft Punk to some
68:34 friends of mine who were at least 15
68:37 years younger than me at the time and
68:38 they were like I have sold stuff I don't
68:41 listen to that crap anymore and so I was
68:44 concerned I was concerned it was like
68:45 you know I keep trying to get people
68:47 listened to and they don't they say is
68:48 old because the industrial electronic
68:52 electronica music it renews like every
68:55 two years anything it was popular two
68:57 years ago like Skrillex is gone man
69:00 nobody calls that guy anymore he's done
69:02 but he was amazing right it's it's weird
69:05 it's kind of a sad epitaph to our
69:08 climate of art today
69:11 it's always what have you done for me
69:12 lately but we're walking out of the
69:15 house and I said you know I expressed my
69:18 concern about death Punk and Stevens son
69:21 said to me he goes really because I
69:23 think that's the best decision I've ever
69:25 heard and I was like ooh and his sons
69:28 like mega genius okay like hands down
69:31 okay
69:33 sure enough soundtrack makes that film
69:38 besides the design which we're going to
69:40 go into the industrial design of it all
69:43 phenomenal my one of my well my favorite
69:47 scene in the whole movie is the light
69:49 cycle scene and when Sam is running down
69:52 the grid in his first game really and he
69:58 grabs the remote and of course the whole
70:00 bike goes around him and stuff and that
70:02 just that cool ass soundtrack that was
70:04 coming in from death Wow but the trivia
70:07 there is that initially they had a
70:11 different vision for the film and it was
70:14 gonna be a lot more I think I think I'm
70:17 correct in saying that Joe's initial
70:18 vision for the movie was gonna be very
70:20 fast-paced and so some of you will
70:23 remember the movie comes out so does the
70:25 soundtrack and then about within six
70:28 months or so I don't know the exact
70:29 interval there's this other whole movie
70:32 album for Tron by deaf punk it's like
70:36 sounds kind of like the first one but
70:38 it's all nightclub II and really fast
70:41 paced according to the sources I have
70:45 that was supposed to be the soundtrack
70:47 for the film and then somebody came in
70:51 and said well this stuff's way too fast
70:52 yeah slow it down and thank God they did
70:54 because it made the film amazing but I
70:58 don't think that that punk was very
71:00 happy about having to pump that out pump
71:02 out the second album because they I
71:03 would I would guess okay they didn't get
71:06 any more money for the second one and
71:09 when you take take your artist seriously
71:11 as Daffy does that's like saying to
71:14 Leonardo make another Mona Lisa what
71:16 opinion it's as popular as that one of
71:19 course it wasn't really popular until
71:20 way after he was dead but still
71:22 so the industrial design of Tron Legacy
71:27 if Joe Kaczynski has one town I think
71:30 he's directing the new top gun right and
71:33 people loved oblivion as well and some
71:35 of his other stuff so his he has an eye
71:40 for design that I think for me he needs
71:45 to stay in projects where he can use his
71:48 eye for design it's not that he's
71:49 actually doing any of the labor himself
71:51 but he has an eye for design ago yes no
71:54 and that brain power of his is top-notch
71:59 men so the design of those you know
72:02 light cycles the stuff via BMW guys
72:04 coming in to design these things just a
72:07 whole army of designers and you know
72:11 I've heard some criticism here and there
72:14 the only criticism I ever really hear
72:16 about the legacy designs was that by the
72:18 time they got to the flying vehicles at
72:20 the end I think people were sort of done
72:24 with the really super thick line design
72:29 you know in my Tron 3 what I do is get
72:32 to the more ornate I kind of makes Art
72:34 Deco metropolis and because we have
72:39 computers that can do amazing things now
72:41 I want to see something that's just
72:43 gorgeous you know it's like Mobius is
72:46 literally swimming in the veins of these
72:48 these programs but you know I have no
72:51 criticism of what they ended up choosing
72:52 in that particular film there were a lot
72:56 of limitations that were surprising for
72:58 the film the the electronic suits that
73:01 they had created we're constantly
73:03 shorting out due to sweat and so you'd
73:06 have a director sorry an actor killing
73:09 their line you're doing a great job and
73:10 then all of a sudden their soup of gold
73:13 could and died and so they'd have to
73:15 redo the scene those suits cost 10
73:18 million dollars in the first in that
73:19 legacy film amazing now of course if any
73:23 of you are Kubrick fans you're gonna see
73:26 Flynn's Kevin Flynn's joint is just
73:29 straight out of 2001 a Space Odyssey the
73:32 lit floor cubes and
73:34 the porcelain table which wasn't
73:37 porcelain in 2001 but it's the same
73:38 exact sort of I think it's like
73:41 furniture evolution sort of design I may
73:44 not have done that
73:45 but hey you make a choice it was fine
73:48 you know one of my favorite lines that
73:52 maybe just kind of go what in the script
73:55 was when Kevin Flynn said he was going
73:56 to bed here he's been the computer in
73:58 eternity and his son shows up for the
74:00 first time and his son hasn't seen him
74:02 for I think twenty years he was like 9
74:05 when he his father went into the
74:06 computer didn't come back out and he's
74:08 only 29 in the movie and then he sees
74:10 his son for the first time he's like
74:11 okay thanks for dinner I'm gonna go to
74:13 bed no it's like bed why does the
74:15 program have to go to bed nobody went to
74:17 bed in the first movie it's a mechanism
74:19 to get Cora and Sam together alone of
74:22 course but but there was a lot of you
74:24 know Star Wars lifting with the force
74:27 you know but still when Kevin Flynn
74:30 walks into the bar it puts his hand down
74:33 and ends the chaos in the bar that's
74:36 pretty cool that was super cool and I
74:39 know that a lot of you were holding out
74:40 for Tron 3 there's four or five
74:43 different fairly active groups on
74:45 Facebook it's not gonna happen and I
74:52 don't know if I it's not my part it's
74:54 not my position or my place to tell you
74:56 to let go it's not that there won't be
74:59 another Tron film and I don't have any
75:01 secret knowledge okay but it will most
75:04 likely be a new Tron film it's something
75:09 new new new and the way the studio's
75:12 work let's say that you have let's say
75:18 Star Wars is active again so it's kind
75:20 of a bad example but let's say that
75:22 Terminator just got a new film which
75:24 bombing horribly but I'm trying to think
75:27 of a franchise well we know now that I
75:31 think that there's going to be an
75:32 Indiana Jones 5
75:34 I'm sure it's being stipulated by
75:37 Harrison Ford that you must die in the
75:38 film Harrison one's himself dead and all
75:42 this franchise this is so weird
75:44 but if you have a franchise like that
75:46 that is done a movie and it's great and
75:49 maybe there's been a sequel the standard
75:52 mode of operation of a studio is to
75:55 always sort of have a writer off to the
75:56 side putting together a sequel concept a
76:00 reboot concept you know just just so
76:03 that if at some point the climate comes
76:07 back that that movies you know become a
76:10 legacy to your surprise they'll have
76:15 something ready so if the head of the
76:16 studio goes okay what do you got and
76:17 they're like oh hey we got this one is a
76:18 reboot this one's a sequel okay great
76:21 let me read that I'll get back to you so
76:23 I think one could rest assure that
76:26 Disney is most likely engaging in that
76:28 standard mode of operations so it's not
76:30 like they're not putting together
76:31 concepts and that sort of thing and
76:34 that's just standard operation so for
76:37 those of you who really want Tron 3 to
76:38 occur you know I would say disengage any
76:42 tears you might have for a sequel to
76:45 occur and just be rest just rest assured
76:49 that they're not stupid okay they're
76:51 gonna develop things over time right now
76:55 some of you who are big Tron Knights you
76:58 know that Disneyland China which I guess
77:02 is in Beijing they have created a Tron
77:05 light-cycle ride I think technically
77:08 speaking it has the most LEDs anywhere
77:10 in the world in one place some of you've
77:13 seen the videos of it on YouTube I can't
77:17 possibly put that in my video without
77:19 getting a strike so go look it up
77:20 yourself it looks phenomenal
77:22 looks amazing and no video is gonna ever
77:25 really show you what the experience is
77:27 like because you're getting on a light
77:29 cycle and you're going through this
77:30 crazy wild world I have not written and
77:32 of course I have no idea what it looks
77:33 like but they are building a new one in
77:35 Disney World because Disney World has
77:37 infinite real estate and they're
77:39 building a brand new one so I don't know
77:44 if they're ever gonna build one at
77:45 California Park they don't have any more
77:47 room at Disneyland
77:49 the California Park does have some areas
77:52 like again where electronic was
77:53 electronica they may have enough real
77:57 estate to squeeze
77:58 in there but it would probably be a lot
78:01 smaller so we'll see what happens
78:03 but you know inventors the Imagineers
78:06 they can do anything so they can take
78:08 the mile long ride that used to be in
78:11 Disneyland for those of you remember and
78:14 those have you never been there
78:15 there was this from the 50s when
78:18 Tomorrowland was invented
78:19 they managed to install a one-mile ride
78:22 and it was about a little car with about
78:24 four people in it and it you just rode
78:27 on it it was a nice place to get off
78:28 your feet you know and it would take you
78:31 in a mile long journey through the park
78:33 and we go inside rides and you would get
78:36 to go you know inside everything at
78:38 Tomorrowland and there used to be this
78:41 little homage to Tron when you would go
78:44 right where star to is is between Star
78:45 Tours and Space Mountain we go inside
78:48 where you could see Space Mountain from
78:50 the from the ride which I think it's all
78:53 been closed up down but you would be
78:56 chased by recognizers and you'd hear
78:57 this soundtrack happen and you'd see the
78:59 grid and it was kind of cool it's just a
79:01 split second little homage to the to the
79:03 original film that's all been ripped out
79:05 now it turned into this thing called
79:08 rocket rides rocket Roz and rocket ride
79:10 or whatever and it was a complete flop
79:13 they kept breaking because they kept
79:15 trying to make these things go really
79:17 really fast for like a hundred feet and
79:19 then they jam on the brakes and that
79:21 just the wear and tear was just too much
79:23 and just kept breaking down so they
79:25 finally just candid the line was
79:27 actually pretty long too but I want to
79:30 talk about go back to the original film
79:32 a little something that relates to
79:38 legacy so it's sort of this bridge
79:39 between the original film and legacy and
79:43 my film my Tron 3 brings this back in a
79:46 big big way the master control program
79:50 is up there in the list of cinematic bad
79:55 guys my list of the top villains of the
80:00 world and I'm going to talk about two
80:02 because there's a lot of great threes in
80:04 my opinion one could say the Terminator
80:07 was pretty damn badass yeah there's all
80:10 the scary movies Michael
80:12 Freddie they're all in their own realm
80:15 but in terms of science fiction villains
80:18 okay
80:19 the number one I think we can all agree
80:22 on is Darth Vader right an
80:25 eight-foot-tall dude who's sort of some
80:27 descendant of the darkside answering to
80:30 the emperor perhaps having Sith origins
80:33 or SIF training you know he's you can't
80:36 see his eyes and his eye sockets I mean
80:39 he's got this force that can kill you
80:40 he's he's amazingly in control once you
80:44 see his backstory by the time of Star
80:47 Wars hits he's being pretty cool about
80:49 it right and of course they hadn't
80:50 developed a lot of the you know yank
80:53 your lightsaber over to your hands sort
80:54 of thing but technically speaking that
80:56 was part of the force even in new hope
81:00 right but I think unequivocally speaking
81:04 and I would be interested in your
81:05 opinion as well I guess The Terminator
81:07 robot is science fiction and that's a
81:09 pretty good one but you can get away
81:12 from the Terminator robot when you're
81:14 inside the computer of Tron 1982 the
81:18 master control program was all knowing
81:22 you know he was a thousand times or
81:25 millions of times smarter than humans
81:26 you know the back story behind him if
81:28 you did pick up on it was that he was an
81:31 old chess program and Dillinger got
81:35 basically lost track of him lost control
81:39 of him so for me when I saw a legacy I
81:43 could not believe I mean clue was always
81:48 going to be a character that could be
81:52 brought back so I don't slide anybody on
81:54 the writing team for picking clue as the
81:58 bad guy but to completely ignore the
82:01 master control program for me who
82:03 technically dies in the first film but
82:06 his death was nothing more than a
82:08 character that faded away and think
82:10 about computer programs it fades away
82:13 okay the guy told you that the master
82:16 control program claimed at the very
82:18 beginning of the film to Dillinger
82:19 senior that he was reading all kinds of
82:22 military computers
82:24 and so he had a network on he was
82:27 actually probably on the Internet's
82:29 which at the time of the movie was only
82:31 about 13 years old I mean technically
82:35 speaking is about a decade before that
82:37 with the military oh did but 1969 is the
82:41 inception date of the internet but they
82:44 overlooked him completely and so in my
82:47 sequel I bring him back with a vengeance
82:49 okay I think the other thing that ended
82:53 up happening with legacy in terms of its
82:55 script because I was I was there during
83:00 the development I would never went this
83:02 Disney Studios I was never in any
83:04 meeting so don't get me wrong I'm not
83:05 trying to pitch myself in the process of
83:08 actual screenwriting but because of my
83:11 proximity to everybody involved you know
83:14 they were really trying to create the
83:17 best script they possibly could as I
83:19 understand there's like 33 writers on
83:21 that first one that first sequel but
83:24 they came up with these things called
83:25 the isomorphous and it was it was so
83:32 complex the concept that if it were to
83:35 be if I were to be in a Star Trek
83:38 episode because Star Trek is the
83:41 absolute master franchise for explaining
83:45 the most complex things that are you
83:48 know cutting-edge theories in the real
83:51 world being dragged into fictional
83:52 scenarios and then implemented right
83:54 like the Dyson Sphere episode right but
83:57 you know anomalies in time the the
84:00 concept of a tachyon you know I mean
84:02 everything that was theoretical was used
84:04 as a piece of equipment a piece of
84:06 substrate to get something to work
84:08 brilliant but the the introduction of
84:12 the isomorphous really sort of what we
84:15 call in writing in Rome the deus ex
84:16 machina which is that got his name back
84:20 in the Greek theater when most Greek
84:23 theater plays would have characters
84:26 involved with each other and then they
84:29 would get to a point of about you know
84:32 being about to you know die and then
84:35 boom they would shake a piece
84:37 deal and here comes the guy would be
84:39 Zeus and Zeus would kill the bad guy and
84:42 save the good guy and boom you got a
84:43 comedy right comedy is defined as the
84:46 character overcoming their obstacle a
84:48 tragedy is a character not overcoming
84:50 their obstacle
84:52 despite introducing the isomorphous
84:56 which just sort of arrives about mid
84:58 movie and is so complex and so ethereal
85:00 that even with my background I'm sitting
85:03 there going what is this again you know
85:05 it's supposed to be like organic AI you
85:09 know sort of what would perhaps have
85:11 given the mCP is his juice right which
85:15 if they had reintroduced the mCP the
85:17 origins of the isomorphic seer beginning
85:20 I leave a completely alone in my script
85:23 but they would have to have explained it
85:27 in sort of that Star Trek II language we
85:29 got four or five people in a circle
85:31 going what is it what is it and through
85:33 multiple explanations of what it is
85:35 if it's a good idea all of a sudden
85:37 clicks with the audience and then you
85:39 don't have to explain it again you just
85:40 use it as a tool and just go to get
85:42 things done I believe it was also
85:46 something mirrored in the Tron uprising
85:48 which if you haven't seen her on top
85:50 rising and you're a fan of Tron and
85:53 you're waiting for the third one to come
85:54 out I I would I could almost guarantee
85:57 anybody who's a big Tron fan has already
85:59 seen uprising and you're like this got
86:02 cancelled what the hell right talk about
86:05 that just a second but Tron Legacy is a
86:08 tragedy Sam never overcomes his obstacle
86:12 he never gets his father out of the
86:13 computer in fact if anything he's
86:15 created a bigger problem by bringing his
86:17 girlfriend out of the computer some
86:18 weird twist you know is like a
86:20 nonsensical twist he brings her out the
86:23 other thing too is he arrives back in
86:24 the real world in his leather jacket
86:27 because when he got into the computer
86:30 there's this absurd scene where he's got
86:32 his street clothes on and they have to
86:35 cut him off his body so they've
86:36 destroyed all of his clothing and they
86:38 put this new suit on him and if you see
86:40 the first fellow and his father shows up
86:41 in the inside the computer and he's just
86:44 dressed in the garb of course he would
86:46 be how could you exist in the computer
86:47 with outside organic material
86:50 there's a volume problem there right so
86:53 Disney after legacy came out they knew
86:56 they had something really big on their
86:58 hands right it's something great and so
87:01 they greenlit Tron uprising which was a
87:04 CG cartoon the head animator slash
87:08 designer I believe is the artist who
87:10 created Aeon Flux from France and that
87:15 was a big thing in the 90s the kids a
87:18 genius right I don't even know all the
87:19 guys but he created a whole new race of
87:24 programs inside this cartoon world which
87:27 is CG but has that kind of car to feel
87:30 to it was just great
87:31 I mean I've sat with females in the room
87:35 looking at Tron uprising watching every
87:38 episode with me and just just being
87:41 awestruck by the design in this series
87:44 it is truly one of the most beautiful
87:47 things ever made on television
87:49 especially in some animated sequence but
87:53 what he did was the the Aeon Flux guy I
87:55 believe he's the one responsible for
87:57 this because it's very reminiscent of
87:59 his original franchise and flux was he
88:02 elongated the legs and he shortened the
88:04 torsos making them different than us
88:08 which is really cool so would be funny
88:11 if you had a program or sorry user go in
88:13 and they had a normal body and normal
88:15 legs that'd be interesting but this
88:17 thing is so beautifully stylized I
88:19 believe there's an Elijah Wood the kid
88:23 that was in the Lord of the Rings
88:26 franchise he plays this character and I
88:28 forget the kid's name in the in this
88:30 series but he is in this repressed world
88:35 where there's the red they're not quite
88:36 as big as they were in Tron he said he'd
88:39 get the sense they were that big but
88:42 they have he's a light cycle mechanic
88:45 with all of his buddies girls and boys
88:48 and it's all makes race it's it's just
88:51 beautifully balanced it's perfect
88:52 and he knows about this legacy of Tron
88:56 being this freedom fighter but Ron's
89:00 nowhere around this first episode
89:03 initially right so this main character
89:06 says you know what I'm gonna go ahead
89:10 and put the put the Batman outfit on I'm
89:12 gonna beat Ron and he essentially sort
89:15 of fights crime at night he's very
89:18 capable and of course he has the disc
89:20 and there should be a little note about
89:22 the disc being deprecated heavily
89:25 another thing they totally missed in the
89:29 sequel was that the disc in the original
89:33 film was sort of a living being and my
89:36 film it's a living thing it's part of
89:38 you right it's your buddy you don't need
89:41 a [ __ ] you got the disc man but when
89:43 they threw a disc in the first film
89:45 because it was hand animated a lot of
89:47 the time instead of just throwing like a
89:49 frisbee with just the regular kinetic
89:51 energy sauropod table you know kinetics
89:55 in the room the ricocheting thing if if
90:00 you were in front of me I would will my
90:04 disc because it is part of me and I
90:06 would throw it behind my back and the
90:09 thing would go around me and then come
90:11 at you so much sexier so much more
90:15 organic and hit so much more meaning
90:17 than this kinetic frisbee thing right
90:19 that's one of the big faux pas Zin my
90:21 opinion of legacy just missed it with CG
90:24 oh my god what you could do with that
90:26 man just lay in a little Waypoint path
90:28 and then the guy throws it and forewoman
90:30 does its thing right but the kid goes
90:33 out and starts fighting crime but Ron
90:37 still exists
90:38 even though he's not quite he's got he
90:40 suffered some deterioration I can't
90:44 remember exactly what the reason was but
90:45 he's got pixelation in him you know he's
90:48 not quite ready he can't do it himself
90:49 necessarily he does get into the game
90:52 but it takes a little while to get him
90:53 out there he captures the kid keeps in
90:57 this beautiful dark room I mean the
90:58 cinematics and the cinematography in
91:02 this series is second to none I mean
91:05 just gorgeous and I've seen the best [ __ ]
91:07 enemy in the world and that's no slide
91:09 on [ __ ] enemy this is fantastic
91:12 but trottin captures the kid and kind of
91:15 conceals who he is and he says so you're
91:16 Durrani he's like yeah and so in this
91:19 beautiful scene the Tron thing has Tron
91:22 has these three squares with a square
91:24 underneath and that's the symbol on his
91:26 chest that it's strong everybody else is
91:28 a different combination and so
91:30 eventually I believe the way the scene
91:32 goes is this thing lights up on his
91:33 chest and of course the kids like oh my
91:36 god I've been talking to the real Tron
91:37 the whole time and so he goes okay I
91:40 don't mind you playing me but you got to
91:42 calm down and I'm gonna show you how
91:44 what to go attack and how to do it and
91:46 also he sends up training the kid in the
91:49 first half of the first season there's
91:50 two seasons to Toronto uprising the
91:53 closing scene before the second season
91:57 is this big battle between red and blue
91:59 it's coming together literally the
92:01 forces are coming together on screen
92:02 they roll credits thinking of course
92:05 we're gonna get a third season but it
92:07 was behind the XD subscription model and
92:10 the viewership went from 1 million to
92:12 300,000 overnight I was buying them
92:16 through Apple TV would have continued by
92:17 buying them to Apple TV or some other
92:21 service whatever the cancellation of
92:24 that program for me goes to the heart of
92:27 a lot of the conspiracies we talked
92:28 about on the show in general which is
92:31 that that algorithm of the many
92:33 defeating the few right people getting
92:36 rid of the ruling class is not an
92:38 algorithm it's a lot on TV this is the
92:41 big reason why gene roddenberry quit
92:43 Star Trek between season 2 and season 3
92:46 they took his intelligent scripts which
92:48 were littered with that exact same
92:51 archetype the mini defeating the few
92:53 over and over and over again you keep
92:56 going to these different planets and
92:57 they're being ruled by some jerks on the
92:59 wopo and they get rid of them because
93:02 Kirk teaches them you know be yourself
93:05 Ben and I think a very similar thing
93:07 happened to Star Trek Enterprise when it
93:09 got canceled 2005 but that's that's a
93:13 different story and it's deep so there
93:16 were a lot of people didn't want to save
93:17 the show they said I got the money I'll
93:19 take over the show we'll pull out of
93:21 subscription put our normal Disney TV
93:23 making money from it anyway
93:25 and it just came down no you're not
93:29 allowed to save it even though you've
93:31 got the authority to keep it going
93:32 you've got the money to keep it going
93:34 no sometimes truth is stranger than
93:39 fiction right
93:40 so in closing I'll say this now that I
93:45 have met dozens and dozens of the people
93:47 that put together this original film
93:48 Tron 1982 you were looking at the peak
93:56 of everyone involved in that movie from
94:01 special effects to writing to acting to
94:06 music everything these people were on
94:10 top of the world and if you really pay
94:12 attention to all of the sets that were
94:14 invented especially you know there's a
94:16 few sets that really just blow my mind
94:19 one of them is the inside of the tank
94:20 that said invented which you really get
94:23 to see with clue and the very beginning
94:24 of the first scene right but the second
94:27 one is when Tron goes into the room
94:30 where he is in the IO Tower and he's
94:32 giving the disk away now there is a
94:35 there's a sore spot for everyone who
94:37 made the film that when the disc
94:40 actually touches the beam and gets
94:42 sucked into this beam and goes up the
94:44 cup the wire I'm not sure what they
94:47 wanted to do I'm not sure this is part
94:49 of the four months that they could have
94:50 fixed the shot but they hate that scene
94:52 a lot of them just go each the way that
94:55 disc just went into the beam I don't
94:57 like that however the most beautiful
95:01 kind of conglomerations of 60s and 70s
95:04 design is that room look at the
95:07 floorboards it's at first this is Mobius
95:11 organic sort of the center of a flower
95:13 looking room but if you really pay
95:15 attention there's these wild like
95:18 digital sprockets just beneath the
95:20 surface of the ground I mean it is
95:22 unbelievable because if you work in film
95:26 what you'll soon realize is if you don't
95:29 communicate a concept it never happens
95:32 and so the fact that you see these
95:35 nuances this just beautiful
95:39 design in this film it is amazing and
95:44 there was one thing I wanted to mention
95:46 too that was a serendipitous mistake
95:48 that I loved as a kid and when I learned
95:51 I sensed that it stopped happening in
95:55 the film but I didn't know why and it
95:58 was that the the film they were shooting
96:01 the movie with film is obviously back in
96:05 the days it's chemicals put on a coda
96:09 list piece of plastic right and so it
96:12 rolls through the camera it gets exposed
96:14 and but you know when they put the
96:20 chemical on the plastic it's literally
96:23 at microscopic different levels of
96:25 density because they're pouring it on
96:26 it's it's gluing over and all that kind
96:28 of stuff so when they deliver film to a
96:31 movie said they number all the boxes so
96:36 that the the emulsion difference stays
96:40 so if it ramps and lighting goes down
96:42 and lighting it's so subtle you can't
96:43 notice it but if you get the boxes out
96:45 of order it's gonna go from thick to
96:47 thin thin to thick and all the other
96:49 stuff and you get pops and light now for
96:52 normal live-action footage you're
96:54 filming Dirty Harry or whatever outside
96:56 you wouldn't notice it but in this
96:59 extreme extremely controlled condition
97:02 where they're doing this this
97:05 backlighting technique to this colorless
97:08 it was creating pops and light and so
97:12 what they ended up doing because they
97:13 were doing the dailies and they were
97:15 looking at this guy what's the poppin
97:16 light so they covered anytime there's a
97:19 popping light they would make a little
97:21 circuit surge go through the go through
97:24 some of the circuits in the scene so it
97:26 looked like the power and the grid was
97:28 sort of surging every once in a while
97:30 which I thought was brilliant it was
97:32 making it look organic it was cool but
97:35 as the story goes and it's it's in the
97:36 making of the 25th anniversary discs
97:40 Alan Shaw and who's had a special
97:43 effects in this burger in their
97:45 respective homes at night
97:48 and they both have the Epiphany oh my
97:50 god
97:51 I bet it's getting the boxes out of
97:53 order and sure enough they phone each
97:55 other and it's like one of these moments
97:56 were like hey guess what I think I fixed
97:58 this they both had the idea next day
98:01 they go down they find out yep
98:04 they're right and so they stopped doing
98:05 it so the surge stopped stopped
98:07 occurring they still created these
98:09 little zips of electricity here and
98:11 there but it didn't quite have the same
98:12 effect that the whole set seemed to
98:14 burst in light you know was really it
98:16 was brilliant it was like this little
98:17 mistake that I think had they had they
98:21 had the kind of retrospective capability
98:24 of looking at it 20 years later and then
98:26 going back in time they might even have
98:27 kept it you know no but the other thing
98:29 about legacy which is really cool it's
98:34 sort of a drawback and it's sort of cool
98:36 when Cameron did avatar he invented this
98:39 big camera to shoot you know the two
98:42 left and right eyes no avatar is split
98:46 between live-action you know the marine
98:49 talking to himself and leaving notes and
98:51 then you have the CG world of course the
98:52 CG worlds left and right eye perfect cuz
98:54 it's being generated by a computer so no
98:56 cameras are being used in the physical
98:58 world to create that but this camera was
99:00 massive okay
99:02 it had to be held on a crane or put on a
99:05 very thick tripod that camera was used
99:08 on Tron Legacy well in defense of Joe
99:14 Kozinski's original vision which we have
99:17 never seen because it was technically
99:18 impossible that camera shows up as the
99:22 stories told to the first day and it
99:26 weighed so much that you know Joe had
99:29 all these visions and storyboards of how
99:31 to move the camera around and get get
99:33 the action into the camera night I think
99:34 he did a brilliant job I think they they
99:36 threw CG and through the techniques that
99:39 they did use they managed to nail it
99:41 they managed to nail an alternative
99:43 really well but the reason why you see a
99:46 lot of these sweeping scenes where the
99:48 camera goes over the you know over the
99:49 characters and turns around and stuff is
99:51 because that's basically all they could
99:52 do with there's a really heavy camera
99:54 and so if you were seeing like a sea and
99:57 you were kind of like well the camera
99:58 feels a little stiff
100:00 that's the reason why and it's not
100:02 because anyone had a lack of vision so
100:05 anyway that's my journey with Tron
100:08 that's why I think it's an amazing film
100:10 hopefully you guys found that valuable
100:13 I'm willing to bet I got a new group of
100:16 people looking at this video never seen
100:18 any my other one so realize that the
100:19 channel is completely different than
100:21 this the other two movies I've reviewed
100:23 which i think are very important films
100:25 is rollerball 1975 with James Caan and
100:29 Blade Runner 1982 I've also reviewed
100:33 Star Trek and the angle there is that
100:36 it's Gene Roddenberry's world which I
100:39 think would be wonderful we could make
100:41 that real but it's gonna take a few
100:43 thousand years of Education for us to
100:45 get there if you haven't into details
100:47 radio.com that's where you can find the
100:48 feed to all the videos realize it's a
100:50 variety show so again it's all over the
100:53 place a lot of fun stuff out there and
100:54 you may find so many other videos
100:55 absolutely not your cup of tea and I
100:57 totally understand if you think you're
101:00 subscribed to the channel you want to be
101:01 subscribed to channel make sure you
101:02 still are because they unsubscribe
101:04 people all the time I guess it's a
101:06 glitch they certainly haven't found with
101:08 sites that are bad so click the Bell if
101:12 you want notifications seems like a lot
101:15 of you have done that because the videos
101:17 get watched very very quickly which is
101:19 great appreciate all of you guys on the
101:21 website you'll find two feeds for video
101:24 I do make a little bit of a pit stop
101:27 right now if you don't have a bit shoot
101:28 account get a bit shoot account would
101:30 you because it's alternative to free
101:33 speech they don't censor and so you can
101:36 see things the way they're meant to be
101:37 and you get information you probably be
101:39 able to get a in any other location
101:41 there's definitely links for the podcast
101:44 so if you want to listen to this an
101:46 audio in your car or when you're working
101:48 out or whatever you're doing that's
101:49 available social media wise we have two
101:52 primaries which are Twitter and Facebook
101:54 the Facebook page is locked so please
101:56 say something human when you apply you
101:58 don't need to put up much words we
102:02 always read everything but there's no
102:03 way for us to reply to you without
102:05 trying to track you down after we let
102:07 you go because as soon as we say you can
102:08 join the group there's no link to you
102:10 anymore just kind of
102:12 bummer then there's Twitter which just I
102:14 put the feet on there it's about it
102:16 don't tweet that much and there's a new
102:17 one which I don't know if it's gonna
102:19 survive but it's called mine's calm in
102:21 my NDS calm it's a Facebook competitor
102:24 it operates just like Facebook they
102:27 they're not really trying to be a video
102:28 source so I post the videos in there
102:32 just like I do for Twitter you know or
102:36 Facebook there's a few ways to donate to
102:38 the page if you find this site cool of
102:41 course the ultimate objective would be
102:43 to do this you know all day long you
102:45 know one one a day sort of thing in
102:47 between my screen writing that kind of
102:49 thing but you know currently I gotta pay
102:53 the bills so right now it's about a
102:55 hundred bucks a month between YouTube
102:57 and patreon affects about 80 bucks to be
103:00 honest there's two products I also
103:03 linked up there the brave browser and
103:08 Backblaze which is the backup software
103:11 you know brave browser everybody needs
103:13 to get it I'm gonna pound Season 5 with
103:15 it
103:15 it's a browser that doesn't it cuts off
103:20 all the tracking it cuts off all the
103:21 deep state stuff looking at you plus if
103:23 you switch the search engine to
103:24 DuckDuckGo 1dr go index is all my
103:29 episodes if you ever want to find any of
103:30 my episodes you don't want to go the
103:31 website he finds them all which is great
103:34 Google does not just connect the dots
103:38 they're right back plays seven bucks a
103:41 month infinite storage for two computers
103:44 so you can have hundred terabytes
103:45 that'll back it all up for you you get
103:48 to go back a year with seven bucks so on
103:50 your on your history you'd saved my
103:52 bacon several times there's at least
103:53 three episodes that wouldn't happen
103:54 without Backblaze so I'm a big believer
103:57 this channel does not have season 1
103:59 episodes those have been remastered and
104:01 put on their own season 1 channel so go
104:03 to the website season 1 right at the top
104:05 click it get yourself some some
104:08 old-school initial episodes the sounds
104:11 been balanced a lot of pause has been
104:13 taken out and all the copyrighted music
104:14 has been removed
104:15 so that's place to get that anyway until
104:19 the next episode take care of yourself
104:20 and someone else and I'll see you in the
104:22 next deep thoughts over now
