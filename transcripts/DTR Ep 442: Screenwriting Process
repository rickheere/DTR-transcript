00:29 welcome back ladies and gentlemen deep
00:31 thoughts on this very cold Thursday
00:35 morning I was starting this episode
00:41 about 1:10 in the morning just thought
00:45 good morning ladies and gentlemen good
00:48 evening good afternoon welcome back to
00:50 deep thoughts
00:51 it's about 1:10 a.m. on a Thursday
00:56 morning I have been chewing up scripts
01:01 all day long and I'm in a collaborative
01:06 writing project right now as the as the
01:11 screenwriter with two producers that
01:13 have hired me to put together script and
01:15 it's interesting because I've never been
01:17 in quite this exact configuration before
01:20 because when I have collaborated with
01:22 scripts I've collaborated with much
01:24 lower level people with less knowledge
01:27 in film in general working with two
01:31 utterly brilliant human beings and who
01:35 just really understand the human
01:37 condition so it's been beyond rewarding
01:41 for myself to be involved in this
01:43 situation and even my writing mentor and
01:47 I we sort of just you know let each
01:52 other right and then we would work on
01:54 kind of what we would bring in after
01:57 kind of dealing with the framework of
01:59 sort of what we were putting together
02:01 because we never tried to co-write
02:02 something at the same time either I'm
02:05 critiquing his script and he's making
02:07 changes or other way around right so I
02:12 thought I would do an episode because
02:13 these episodes believe it or not even if
02:15 you guys are like why are you doing
02:16 these screenwriting things so weird it's
02:18 off base I'm getting a lot of feedback
02:22 as a result of these episodes matter of
02:27 fact my current gig is a result of
02:29 someone searching for people teaching
02:32 this stuff and then finding me and going
02:34 wow I work with some other professionals
02:36 you
02:37 I like your style let's go together and
02:39 we're we're doing great we picked a
02:43 really tricky script and we're having a
02:46 blast with it even what we're dealing
02:49 with where we're trying to crack things
02:51 in the script you know which is getting
02:53 something to work perfectly it's it's
02:58 just been a blast and so we're trying to
03:01 put it all together so here's what I'm
03:03 going to talk about today which is
03:06 collaborating tips when you collaborate
03:09 with other people on scripts but this
03:10 will also have a great methodology for
03:15 you to think about when you're by
03:17 yourself how to construct the script
03:19 because I've told you a lot of
03:22 techniques that I have learned from
03:23 other people about writing scripts in
03:25 terms of breaking down your acts and all
03:27 that kind of stuff and we'll review a
03:30 little bit of that in this lesson but
03:31 the major element is in this particular
03:36 episode will be what layers go first
03:39 second and third because your script has
03:42 you know a timeline and for those of you
03:46 who never listened to my lessons in any
03:49 screenwriting I write in a for act
03:50 format each act being 30 minutes
03:52 totaling 120 minutes the classic method
03:55 was three acts which is the center act
03:58 of 60 minutes and what I found from SIDS
04:01 field Syd field teaching which was
04:03 excellent it's just that my brain has a
04:05 hard time conceiving of 60 minutes as
04:09 one act because you are absolutely
04:11 aiming for a center point in the movie
04:15 where something massive happens so why
04:17 not just say that's the end of act 2 and
04:19 then act 3 is the second half of the
04:21 classic act 2 and then your final act is
04:24 act 4 so just understand when I talk
04:26 about 1 2 3 4 it's not it's based on a
04:30 4x system okay
04:32 you got it now one thing I'm running
04:35 into with this experience is because the
04:38 producers live about an hour away from
04:40 me and some change we're not able to be
04:43 together every single day and so as much
04:46 as we might send an email write a
04:49 document I even do voiceover
04:51 just like this and send them you know
04:54 like get the document out and read it or
04:56 just listen to the recording my effort
04:58 is to try and make it as easy as
05:00 possible so you can just put headphones
05:01 in and clean the house and just think
05:03 about it right or do whatever they have
05:05 to do driving a car but no matter what I
05:08 do to try and communicate my concept
05:10 there's always some aspect of the vision
05:15 of my brain that doesn't 100% get inside
05:19 their brain and that's where you have to
05:22 develop some very intense skills there's
05:28 other just human things that occur when
05:32 someone else has a vision for film and
05:34 they're hiring you to make that vision a
05:37 reality they have to remember every
05:41 single thing that they are trying to get
05:45 done and they'll get a damn good list
05:48 together but then when you start
05:50 fleshing it out into reality they start
05:52 realizing there was a bunch more and so
05:55 it's this iterative process and
05:56 sometimes last-minute thought process
05:59 can create a whole bunch of work or
06:02 break a bunch of stuff that you've
06:04 already done and you just have to love
06:06 writing and love collaboration and it
06:09 all even though it might be considered
06:11 like bad news or whatever it's not it's
06:14 just you get to do more writing that's
06:17 the fun part so in the middle of all
06:21 this you know I'm a process guy I'm an
06:22 engineer so for me everything I do for
06:24 my own life is very structured because I
06:27 don't want to waste any time in my life
06:29 not a single minute if I'm wasting a
06:31 minute I want to know I'm wasting that
06:33 minute and I want it to be my choice to
06:35 simply relax than some paradigm of some
06:37 sort right so what I have come up with
06:39 in order to help myself communicate to
06:43 you know other folks in the middle this
06:46 process is something that I like to
06:48 share with you because it's going to put
06:50 a chronology on the process of what's
06:55 the first thing I need to do what's the
06:57 second thing I need to do now the
06:58 problem with me or the only problem or
07:01 catch with this is that you know one if
07:04 you're successful and you're
07:05 right then you don't need to listen to
07:07 me you don't that perhaps listen to the
07:10 other episodes to jog something in your
07:12 memory but if you're trying to get into
07:15 the industry of doing this and you need
07:17 to move quick because if I was writing
07:19 for television it just depends you know
07:21 I mean they have a ton of writers that
07:23 write on top of each other constantly
07:24 and you know that's how they can do a an
07:28 episode every week on a television show
07:30 because they have maybe like eight
07:31 writers and someone's doing one week and
07:34 the next week and that thing so you have
07:35 about a two month lead time if you were
07:37 to write one in lockstep with everybody
07:39 else right and you know I know that
07:44 there are probably far better techniques
07:47 out there from the super pro television
07:49 writers especially that would put this
07:51 video to shame but for those of you
07:54 getting started this will give you a
07:55 damn good framework to move quickly and
07:58 I'll give an example when you have an
08:03 idea to write a movie it's usually
08:05 because you have something in your head
08:08 you might have a premise but what if you
08:12 know an alien comes down from outer
08:15 space and lands on a little kids
08:16 backyard hides in the shed and then the
08:18 little kid discovers him and they have
08:21 an adventure together that's all you got
08:24 it's a premise it's no story there
08:26 really I mean it's like the framework of
08:28 a story maybe but you don't really have
08:30 what's gonna happen next and next next
08:31 gets involved what are the other
08:32 characters but that's good enough so you
08:36 start working on it the second type of
08:39 thing that will happen to me all the
08:40 time is I see a completely finished
08:43 scene that's just either hilarious or
08:45 gripping or interesting it could be you
08:49 know again I've had I've had movies come
08:51 to me before some gnarly hitman scene
08:54 I've had movies come to me where a guy
08:57 tries to kill himself you know it just
09:00 happens and so you have that little
09:03 tidbit and you know when Steve Jobs died
09:06 and Johnny Ives went to the podium at
09:09 Apple to kind of give his pay his
09:11 respects to Steve he mentioned something
09:13 that Steve Jobs used to always say and
09:14 this is very indicative of
09:18 these ideas and for those of your
09:20 musicians you know it's exactly the same
09:22 thing you got a riff in your mind you
09:23 get a melody or something like that you
09:25 get the a but not the B or whatever he
09:28 says it's like catching a butterfly your
09:31 idea is the butterfly it's a very tender
09:35 object being that you can't just grab
09:38 with your hand you have to net the
09:41 butterfly and keep him safe and then put
09:46 them wherever you want them and so you
09:47 can see him every single day and make
09:49 sure he's healthy because he might die
09:50 if he dies then what's the point of
09:52 having it right once you catch it you
09:54 can make it grow or help it grow and so
09:58 that's why most writers have some sort
10:02 of dictaphone or that type of
10:05 application on the telephone some when
10:07 they have an idea BAM they hit it they
10:09 record their voice because there might
10:11 be driving or something like that
10:13 old-school comedians they usually carry
10:15 them around all those little tiny
10:16 notebooks and a pin and they just always
10:18 pin it into their notepad and then
10:21 develop it later and this is how you
10:23 incubate your film up from scratch and
10:26 the process can last up to two years it
10:29 could last 10 years last film I wrote
10:32 for myself as a concept I've had in my
10:34 mind for 10 years it was just this
10:37 little tiny loose treatment in fact when
10:38 I gave it to my agent it was just like a
10:40 paragraph I thought looks pretty cute
10:42 and then later I said which one should I
10:45 write next I want to change the style up
10:47 quite a bit from everything I've been
10:48 writing a lot before that was Tron 3 and
10:52 then there was a couple other hardcore
10:55 scripts someone something playful I
10:58 wanted a comedy so I picked this and
11:00 kaboom it turned into my opinion the
11:03 best thing I've ever written and it's
11:05 for boys and girls and men and women and
11:07 it's just it'll break your heart but
11:10 it'll also make you cry and a good way
11:12 for happy endings and that kind of style
11:16 but the problem is is you're capturing
11:19 things it's not really a problem but the
11:21 challenge is is that you have different
11:23 layers of your script and if you don't
11:28 know what bucket your current
11:31 thought process is lending itself to
11:33 then you will have a bunch of notes but
11:38 you don't know quite how to sift
11:40 everything together and I'm gonna give
11:41 you a little layering system here so
11:44 that you can always find the bucket now
11:47 sometimes it's all you need this is a
11:48 paradigm for writing screenplays now on
11:52 paper you are going to create obviously
11:59 some premise that you have thought up
12:01 again robot travels from the future
12:04 comes to the past and tries to kill a
12:06 person that's going to have a baby
12:08 that's going to fight the robots in the
12:10 future
12:10 that's a premise you might think that's
12:13 a story but you really don't care about
12:15 any of that until it's a beautiful woman
12:18 that is the person he's gonna kill who's
12:21 living in her own life she's got her own
12:22 struggles and here comes a goddamn robot
12:24 out in thin air
12:26 trying to kill her and she now has the
12:28 she has to grow up and go from a average
12:32 you know person to being a super robot
12:35 killer and then I'm sure that was the
12:40 premise which then later on they thought
12:43 okay I need to add some characters we
12:44 need to twist this up and then John
12:46 Connor shows up as her husband or you
12:53 know the guy it's gonna knock her up to
12:55 have this kid what's going to grow up to
12:57 be the one that's going to cause the
12:58 problems in the future so they spice it
13:01 up a little bit now once you have your
13:05 premise down and you will continue to
13:07 mold your premise you will because you
13:11 know it's just like again it's like if
13:16 someone were to show you the interior of
13:18 a spaceship and it just had one button
13:21 that said go where I'm thinking
13:23 Hollywood would not make that spaceship
13:26 unless they were making probably a
13:29 comedy or they really worked hard to
13:33 sell you this one button interface right
13:36 Hollywood will make a super command
13:39 center something gorgeous with the
13:41 latest and greatest concepts and
13:43 interfaces
13:44 materials what have you remember like
13:46 the new JJ Abrams Enterprise bridge was
13:50 just beyond gorgeous nothing wrong with
13:53 the old ones they're their own level of
13:55 brilliance but what he did was brilliant
13:57 to reboot the franchise poor guy didn't
14:00 have a decent script but since he
14:03 created Fringe will always write that
14:05 guy a blank check but once you have your
14:07 premise you didn't have to put your
14:09 story on top and so your first layer
14:13 down below is your premise which is
14:14 literally it's the first constraints in
14:17 your universe that your story has to
14:19 obey so if your premise for Star Wars is
14:24 the imperial force is going after the
14:26 Rebel Alliance and vice versa
14:28 well who is the Imperial force well they
14:31 seem to have gobs of cash they have
14:34 massive weapons they have incredible
14:37 scientists that can make these weapons
14:39 they always show up bigger and bigger
14:40 ships bigger and bigger Death Star's
14:42 that can destroy planets for Christ's
14:44 sake right and your rebels are always
14:46 dealing with scrappy stuff everything is
14:49 barely painted and you just kind of duct
14:51 tape everything together stole premise
14:55 and then you might have you start
14:58 introducing your characters well Boy
14:59 Wonder
15:00 Luke Skywalker meet obi-wan Kenobi they
15:03 find out they have this connection
15:05 through his father he desperately wants
15:08 to join the rebellion and they make a
15:11 pact they go to the cantina and tan to
15:15 wean they find han Solo and Chewie they
15:18 run a ship they're gonna rescue a
15:19 princess because there was a little
15:21 message in a robot it's a little bit
15:24 between the premise and the story but
15:27 the premise can control the walls are
15:29 Lightspeed here's a knock Lightspeed can
15:32 you really destroy a planet yes you can
15:33 really destroy a planet there's a dark
15:36 side and a light side mitigate you know
15:39 facilitated by the force so as you write
15:43 your story on top well what's the
15:46 situation with Luke Skywalker well he
15:48 lives with his aunt and uncle he's stuck
15:52 there he really wants to go join the
15:54 Academy or learn how to fly and his
15:56 uncle's like I need you here
15:58 we're not sure if his uncle was trying
16:00 to protect him from getting killed in
16:01 war or if he actually needed the help
16:03 seems like he's got plenty of robots to
16:05 help to help him out droids obi-wan
16:09 Kenobi well you've got to create a world
16:11 where this guy can just up and leave
16:13 yeah so you assume he's retired
16:15 well you meet this smuggler with his
16:18 hairy buddy and he makes money going
16:20 from point A to point B that's what he
16:22 does
16:23 kid wants a ride yeah they got a
16:26 princess they're gonna be saving they
16:28 figured she's got some dough so we'll
16:31 give him what we can give him now
16:32 promised him the world and he takes the
16:35 bait but what's the hook we don't want
16:38 any Imperioli you know entanglements ah
16:41 there's the key he says you know you're
16:44 actually in some deep and they're
16:46 really nuts but they're gonna go get her
16:48 from the Imperial force and so you know
16:49 they're in a they're in trouble and the
16:53 movie progresses down the line so your
16:57 premise goes first which is the
16:59 limitations to your world and what must
17:02 occur to facilitate the story the part
17:05 on top is your story which is why do you
17:08 care why do you care why do you like
17:11 Luke Skywalker because he's an innocent
17:14 kid George Lucas purposely asked Mark
17:17 Hamill as I understand it to play sort
17:19 of a whiny kid all right but the genius
17:24 continues in that franchise especially
17:26 for the first movie all the way to the
17:28 end you know me Lew Lucas trying to
17:30 convince Han to participate in this run
17:33 against the Death Star and he's like hey
17:35 sorry buddy I want to live and you guys
17:38 are all a bunch of suicidal maniacs and
17:40 he's just like you know what if they win
17:42 you won't have a world to live in you
17:46 won't be able to smuggle anything and
17:48 you know quite frankly when they made
17:49 the Han Solo movie solo he already knew
17:53 that so now you have this general story
17:57 kids gonna team up with the old guy grab
18:01 a couple other folks and go save the
18:02 princess in the Death Star and you might
18:05 okay eventually obi-wan Kenobi Kenobi is
18:08 going to go after Darth Vader because
18:09 they're all buddies we don't quite know
18:11 how that can
18:11 works Luc's told that that dude killed
18:15 his dad so there's a bit of a personal
18:16 sting there but he's also very
18:18 formidable and the kid knows he's a kid
18:20 the princess is anything but a Mika
18:22 female she's absolutely the Omega female
18:26 she can handle her own
18:27 they eventually escape get to a safe
18:30 place but oh my god they got to go back
18:32 and blow that place up because someone
18:34 died to get the plans to it still you
18:38 know that's mostly premise I'll see your
18:40 setup you got to make everything counts
18:43 what are people gonna say that makes
18:46 anybody feel anything you know that's
18:50 your story later now once you have those
18:51 two pretty facilitated your premise and
18:54 then your story which you may not be
18:58 able to get your story completely
18:59 figured out before this first general
19:02 step of writing which I am now calling
19:06 the framework now I learned through some
19:11 making of interview with Luke
19:16 Sir George Lucas excuse me but he writes
19:20 12 scenes per Act you know if you go the
19:23 old three act formatted be twenty four
19:25 scenes in the back too but so what I do
19:28 is just four sets of twelve now your
19:31 your last act your act for may or may
19:34 not need twelve scenes you can end it
19:35 whenever it needs to end now some people
19:38 do write really long movies and if
19:41 you're not a director who's already
19:43 signed with someone if you're not a
19:44 writer already signed and and you're
19:47 told to go two hours and 30 minutes or
19:49 three hours or three and a half hours
19:51 you should be writing 90 minutes to 120
19:54 minutes which is 90 pages to 120 pages
19:57 somewhere between those two counts and
20:00 your agent will love you and anyone
20:02 happen to read your script will love
20:03 that you can get the stories finished
20:05 quicker they may Commission another 30
20:08 minutes they might say well this scene
20:10 could really use a lot more work and a
20:11 lot more dimensionality so we're gonna
20:14 take that give it 15 minutes instead of
20:15 two and then you know you acquire more
20:18 pages but you're not typically the
20:21 person that's going to do that
20:23 especially if you're just starting out
20:25 I think it's wise to know where you
20:27 would Commission more pages yourself
20:30 you're like well I blew through that
20:31 really quickly you know what I ended up
20:33 doing to save page time is I don't
20:36 really spell out confrontation scenes
20:40 like if two people are fighting if if I
20:43 was writing John wick it depends if I am
20:46 really a stunt coordinator savvy writer
20:50 I might try to write some of the knife
20:53 moves some of the gun moves but the only
20:56 moves that you need to articulate or
20:57 moves that are important and so you
21:00 write those moves and you leave the
21:01 stunt coordinators and the director to
21:04 make all the other decisions about how
21:06 long is this fighting I really doubt
21:09 that John Carpenter when he directed
21:12 they live wrote 10 pages for the
21:16 10-minute fight in the alley he just was
21:19 directing and he probably wrote in there
21:20 this fight has to last a long time
21:23 because the metaphor here is that people
21:26 sometimes neither asks beaten to see the
21:30 truth because they will fight you they
21:33 don't want to see the truth and that is
21:35 what happens in that scene but your
21:38 framework is very non emotional how
21:45 could it be emotional if every line is a
21:48 bullet that doesn't wrap on the page
21:52 generally speaking I might have a word
21:54 or two goes around the corner but you're
21:56 not trying to quote dialogue alright so
21:59 your prose aren't in there yet you're
22:01 saying this thing happens that thing
22:03 happens this thing happens and what
22:04 you're trying to do with your framework
22:05 if you've ever been an actor it's really
22:08 deciding all the blocking in your script
22:10 the action that locks into the next
22:13 action to the next action such that the
22:15 thing feels natural for instance if
22:18 you're writing some sort of you know
22:23 Mission Impossible type of script and
22:26 you have the actors in New York but
22:28 somehow they need to get to Egypt for
22:31 something you can't just have them
22:35 talking at add some coffee thing without
22:38 mentioning
22:39 and all sudden being there in Egypt you
22:41 know it's get doesn't work like that you
22:42 got to have the dialog says they make
22:45 the decision to go to Egypt based on
22:47 evidence from maybe a previous bullet
22:50 then there's some sort of journey even
22:53 if it's quick even if it's a flash and
22:55 boom they're landing in Cairo whatever
22:57 you're gonna have to tie it all together
22:58 so you have like your your travel
23:01 dialogue I mean your travel framework
23:03 how they go from one place to another
23:04 and why why are you why are you changing
23:07 locations you need to have all that
23:09 figured out but the other big one is all
23:12 of the metaphysics behind the characters
23:15 dishes decision to do one thing or
23:18 another
23:18 one of the things you'll find it's it's
23:22 actually very fun even though it could
23:24 be it could be a ball kicker is trying
23:28 to make sure the audience understands
23:30 why two characters are hanging out with
23:32 each other what's the motivation for
23:34 them to be together now if you start
23:36 them off and they're best friends that's
23:38 the reason but if two folks are meeting
23:40 each other it'd have never been together
23:41 and they're gonna trust each other you
23:44 got to figure that out in Star Wars Hey
23:48 you have the old man traveling deciding
23:53 to travel with Luke Skywalker pretty
23:54 much when you have this message from
23:56 Princess Leia pop out of this little
23:59 droid called r2d2 and then his aunt and
24:04 uncle are murdered as well as the Jawas
24:06 are murdered by these Imperial forces so
24:09 it's like obi-wan Kenobi is a Jedi and
24:14 Jedi's are sworn to sort of protect the
24:18 innocent
24:19 they're like the greatest police officer
24:20 force in the galaxy right and so even
24:23 though he's old and he probably some
24:26 back pain he's still gonna go with the
24:27 kid to get him sort of to his
24:29 destination okay kid doesn't even know
24:32 where to commission a a vehicle off the
24:35 planet and so the old man says we got to
24:38 go to the canteen you got to watch out
24:39 this place is the nastiest place on
24:41 planet earth or on planet Tatooine and
24:44 so he Usher's the kid through the
24:46 negotiation process because the kids
24:48 real jumpy and young and idealistic
24:52 and of course on solos like man I'm
24:54 gonna take this kid for everything he's
24:55 gotten and of course the old man's next
24:57 to him protecting him so what makes them
24:58 all get together well two of them are on
25:02 a spiritual journey to save a girl the
25:06 other guys are just out for money
25:08 Chewbacca is welded to Han Solo for a
25:11 million previous reasons where they
25:13 saved each other's ass and so they're
25:15 bound at the hip for that reason so two
25:18 guys they're going for greed maybe one
25:21 guys going for reading the other was
25:22 just his buddy and then the other two
25:23 are going for a moral uptick reason of
25:26 actually saving someone from the nasty
25:30 Empire but here's the thing you might
25:34 have it really well thought out that
25:37 this is the reason why my characters
25:39 hang out with each other
25:41 initially but then things change if
25:45 you're running a decent script you were
25:47 challenging your characters constantly
25:49 right there's the Robert McKee you have
25:52 to get his book his last name spelled M
25:55 cke his crowning jewel is a book called
26:01 story
26:01 he has another book out which I do not
26:03 own but I've been to his class enough I
26:05 feel like I have that already and he he
26:08 mentioned the last to summit seminars or
26:11 whatever four-day events that he was
26:14 putting this book together he is the
26:17 genius but he's also so intense that for
26:20 newcomers he might be a little too
26:22 intense so I don't know by the time I
26:24 found McKee in 2007 I had been writing
26:30 off and on using Sid fields books for 17
26:34 years
26:34 I'd already finished my first script but
26:37 it was sort of like a pipe dream at the
26:38 time something I wanted to do but I was
26:40 very busy and other things but when I
26:43 read met my writing mentor it became
26:45 real and he goes look I'll help you but
26:46 you got to go to his classes so within
26:49 two months I was in one of his classes
26:52 because it just happened to hit at the
26:53 right time but I will tell you he does
26:57 add more in the class than is in the
27:00 book but he barely misses a thing in the
27:02 book he just elaborates in the class
27:04 from the book
27:05 he doesn't use his book but that's what
27:08 he teaches and he reads the book in
27:10 audio so my recommendation is by the
27:13 book on audio and just run it in your
27:15 car a hundred times until you can recite
27:18 it yourself it doesn't mean you're gonna
27:20 be able to accomplish what he's telling
27:23 you to accomplish immediately but you'll
27:26 get there so after your characters get
27:28 gapped this is what he calls it what's
27:31 the what's a good gap example person has
27:36 a normal wake up routine they wake up
27:38 out of bed what do they do they they go
27:41 and brush their teeth they turn the turn
27:43 the coffee pot on they're brushed your
27:44 teeth maybe they take their shower and
27:45 then it come out part of themselves some
27:47 coffee read the newspaper check on their
27:50 cell phone leave get in the car and go
27:52 to work that's their thing this
27:54 particular day they try to turn on the
27:57 coffeemaker it sizzles burns out now if
28:03 they want coffee they're gonna have to
28:05 need to find a new way to make the
28:06 coffee in the house or they're gonna
28:08 have to add going to some coffee place
28:10 for you know before they go to work now
28:14 that means they got a rush a little bit
28:16 because they're gonna lose about 15 20
28:17 minutes standing in line because they
28:19 just know how that works
28:20 downstairs right but they go to the
28:23 bathroom and the tube of toothpaste is
28:25 empty the hot waters out I mean just
28:27 everything goes wrong and this forces
28:30 things to occur that would normally
28:31 occur thus changing the day where you
28:34 can add more things so they're standing
28:35 in line for the coffee but they never
28:37 stand in line in and he or she meets the
28:41 ER scammer it's gonna play them that day
28:44 or the love of their life but that
28:46 person doesn't recognise that they exist
28:47 and so that we were on we wrong with the
28:49 premise right they're gonna try to find
28:52 this person or escape this person that's
28:54 a gap if two characters are together and
28:58 they are incurring threats especially
29:03 then each time a character encounters
29:07 threat if your characters are made
29:09 properly they're very different from
29:11 each other because nobody wants to see
29:13 like for all Schwarzenegger together
29:15 doing the same exact thing
29:17 even the
29:19 the what is it the city untouchables
29:23 where he has all the other superhero
29:26 guys in the movie with him all amazing
29:29 leading actors that you know are
29:30 essentially their own little James
29:31 Bond's they have the Constitution to
29:34 stick in the game because there are
29:36 trained soldiers that works it's not as
29:39 interesting but they all have a
29:40 different take on what they should be
29:42 doing and how they should be doing it
29:43 and that's where the friction comes in
29:45 that's where the script starts to pop
29:46 for your mind right so the framework has
29:51 four pieces for acts 12 scenes a piece
29:54 roughly they must total up to about 30
29:58 pages a pop when you're done so you know
30:01 some scenes might be and you might have
30:03 15-20 scenes and a particular act
30:06 because some of the scenes are just
30:07 little visits to a situation that might
30:10 be 60 seconds long and so it's not long
30:13 enough to fill up the 30 pages so go
30:14 ahead and you know don't feel guilty go
30:16 ahead and add more in there and you may
30:18 have a situation where you know like a
30:20 Tarantino scene that might last 8 to 10
30:22 minutes and what if he has three of
30:25 those he only has three dots three
30:27 bullets in his first act but he's gonna
30:30 probably sub-bullet those acts that
30:32 really talk about what's going on at
30:34 those locations now I want to pass on to
30:38 you a metaphor for any scene you would
30:44 put inside your framework and it goes
30:49 something like this there is a an
30:52 illustration I'll put one up on the
30:54 screen here of the classic mathematical
30:56 function and believe it I know that
30:58 sounds strange if you hate math don't
31:00 worry it says not doing math but it's
31:02 essentially a picture of a box and you
31:05 put components in the top and you get a
31:08 third component at the bottom a plus B
31:10 equals C at the bottom right okay you
31:13 should I mean there would be some
31:15 functions I guess in the world which
31:17 would actually have a and B pop out at
31:18 the bottom but that's not what you're
31:20 supposed to do you're supposed to have
31:22 the classic mathematical function for
31:24 every bullet in your framework script
31:27 you're going to have elements going
31:32 characters and their action and then
31:34 something's gonna pop out that's new at
31:36 the bottom if you didn't have something
31:38 new popping out at the bottom of your
31:40 little box it has the scene in it then
31:43 the scene is useless you didn't change
31:46 anything unless there's some really
31:49 special circumstance or that's exactly
31:51 what you need to have happen to throw
31:53 the audience off or something you're
31:56 always gonna want it to change
31:58 you will mole around this framework
32:00 document at least with two other people
32:02 before potentially quite a while before
32:07 everyone's on the same page before
32:08 everybody agrees that the scenes that
32:10 you have thought up in terms of why a
32:14 couple characters or a character is that
32:17 particular location and why they would
32:20 go to the next location you have to work
32:21 out all the logistics as to why this
32:24 would occur right I'll give you an
32:26 example what if you had there's the
32:29 movie attraction this Russian English
32:33 dubbed movie which that the audio
32:36 dubbing is just an f-plus but the movies
32:39 actually very beautiful and very
32:40 touching but there's a scene where a
32:45 spaceship falls out of space because it
32:48 was attacked by the Russians and it
32:51 destroys Moscow I think it's Moscow and
32:55 the a big piece of the engine fell out
32:58 well it's not big piece but it's about
32:59 about the size of mm about 3 foot by 2
33:05 foot thing but inside is this special
33:07 doodad that makes the ship run and so
33:11 the alien inside the ship has got to get
33:14 out and find this thing somewhere in the
33:15 rubble and eventually it gets picked up
33:19 by the military and taken into a
33:21 top-secret location and it's being
33:24 analyzed by scientists and of course
33:26 everything's quarantine everyone's in
33:27 hazmat suits and all this stuff and
33:31 obviously the alien has to get the thing
33:34 out of the top-secret facility so let's
33:39 just say that's in your script and then
33:41 you want to say this is when a alien
33:42 gets it you have to figure out
33:45 how's that alien gonna get into that
33:47 really top-secret location if he's not
33:50 like a superhero that can just you know
33:53 put his eyes and laser through in this
33:55 particular movie was very mortal the guy
33:57 that pops out it's very much like The
34:01 Day the Earth Stood Still up to a point
34:03 where the guy that comes out of the ship
34:05 is very human-like and very fragile and
34:08 so the writers had to figure out a
34:11 technique in a time in a place that was
34:14 right to get him in and get this piece
34:18 but they also were brilliant enough to
34:20 understand that the audience really
34:22 needs to meet this guy first they need
34:25 to figure out who he is because you know
34:27 he's there and he's a charming
34:29 good-looking guy and he's got this girl
34:31 that kind of falls in love with them
34:32 slowly over time because he's so
34:35 considerate and innocent he's vulnerable
34:37 and she's a woman and she's got the
34:38 maternal instinct to take care of him
34:41 and so but she's also kind of like
34:45 doesn't want to get too close to them at
34:47 first and all the natural things that
34:49 occur and it's those metaphysical
34:51 reasons why they would behave the way
34:54 they would behave that you have to
34:55 decide and it gets to be this very
35:01 delicate process it's very similar to
35:05 maybe a jeweler trying to find the right
35:08 angle to cut a diamond to make the
35:09 perfect baguette or emerald cut diamond
35:13 now that's a basic framework that you
35:17 might be writing it will feel even the
35:20 most basic story will feel like a puzzle
35:25 and so you are a bit of a puzzle solver
35:30 when you're writing now when you write a
35:33 novel you have far less constraints
35:37 because nothing is supposed to happen on
35:39 page 30 on page you know 60 on page 90
35:43 on page 120 you just write as long as
35:45 you need to write so we get the stand
35:48 you know 1,500 pages unabridged so in
35:51 film you get massive discipline and you
35:55 have to be really okay with that
35:57 discipline and love
35:58 discipline you know as much as I will
36:02 bring an idea to the folks I'm working
36:05 with now and they don't like it or they
36:08 feel like it should be a different way
36:09 because we've seen other films do it
36:11 differently it's still for me super
36:15 exciting that I say hello I get to go
36:16 back into the puzzle and rebuild it you
36:18 have to be that kind of person I mean
36:20 that's what I I recommend now you do get
36:24 a bunch of like prissy writers that are
36:26 you know they'll scream and shout out
36:28 Hollywood destroys their film and that
36:30 does occur in a very blatant way
36:32 sometimes the most minimal changes I
36:35 will hear writers talk about they're
36:36 just complaining like little whiny kids
36:38 and you're like dude this business isn't
36:41 for you if that's how fragile you are
36:43 with collaboration collaboration is the
36:46 beauty of bringing together everyone
36:47 else's ideas and then watch it on the
36:50 big screen and going oh my god that part
36:52 was mine and you were right that scene
36:54 was awesome and it finally got put on
36:56 screen and you have to trust other
36:58 people's instincts and that's why you
37:01 want to build a good team because magic
37:04 happens let me tell you now let's say in
37:09 addition to a normal script you actually
37:12 are going to write some sort of tricky
37:14 twisty mystery because if you so much as
37:18 want to put a twist in your script
37:20 you're on to a mystery and some genres
37:24 really lend themselves well to twists I
37:26 think that because we've seen all of the
37:29 standard storytelling so much we may be
37:33 getting to the end of a twist era for a
37:36 while but I'm not sure we're quite there
37:38 yet
37:39 I think a clever twist always makes the
37:42 mind go oh my god you know it's just
37:44 it's just a fun little thing like for
37:47 instance I think in Star Wars new hope
37:51 episode four the twists were you know
37:56 fairly minimal there were surprises I
37:58 mean when aunt and uncle Veeru get
38:00 killed of that wasn't something we all
38:03 saw coming when obi-wan Kenobi gets
38:07 struck down by Darth Vader at the end
38:09 that was definitely a surprise but
38:11 and nothing will touch the conclusion of
38:15 Empire Strikes Back right
38:17 a true twist now when you're trying to
38:22 figure out how much time it's going to
38:23 take to create your script I would say
38:26 that and I knew I missed it on this
38:29 particular project where if I'd really
38:33 thought it through and thought through
38:35 the level of difficulty of adding
38:38 another layer of logistical twisting you
38:43 have to add a little more time for that
38:44 and because I can write fairly quickly
38:47 I'm probably fine with the current
38:49 project I'm on but I probably would have
38:50 added another month just to handle the
38:52 twist enos so that we could really you
38:55 know hone it down but once you have your
38:58 framework laid down and everybody feels
39:00 comfortable your next layer up is to do
39:03 your breakdown sheet of all of your
39:05 scenes so what did I say your ideal
39:09 framework document would look like it's
39:12 48 bullets separated into four pieces
39:15 four groups
39:16 roughly and it generally tells the whole
39:19 story and anyone who knows your film and
39:22 we're gonna talk about collaboration at
39:23 the end of this thing anybody's working
39:25 with you on the script they're filling
39:28 in all of the stuff that's missing from
39:30 those bullets because you've already had
39:33 a conversation with each other and you
39:35 generally know where you're going with
39:36 things like your NYX your next layer up
39:40 is to take every bullet and turn it into
39:42 a 100% paragraph of what is happening in
39:45 this scene what is important in this
39:48 scene if anything is being said that's
39:50 profound
39:50 you got to call it out to the best of
39:53 your ability in this early phase and so
39:56 that document might go as long as say
40:00 short as eight pages could go 20 30
40:02 pages it just depends but here's the
40:06 beautiful thing by layering things up by
40:08 the time you get to your screenwriting
40:10 software and start knocking out scenes
40:12 you have everything figured out it's
40:15 just the beauty of bringing it to life
40:17 in the third stage so the second stage
40:20 up you know I'm kind of considering the
40:23 premise and the story something we're
40:24 holding
40:25 her head framework is the first write it
40:27 down phase well you sift through all of
40:29 your notes next one up is what I call
40:33 the scene breakdown where we're having
40:35 everything explained possibly and
40:37 usually you want to describe all the
40:39 physical blocking in a particular scene
40:41 such as if it's important where someone
40:44 is standing in a room and then they
40:45 migrate across the room and as they're
40:48 migrating across the room is it a slow
40:49 walk is it a fast walk
40:52 what are they saying that is that is
40:54 really setting the tone how are they
40:57 speaking you don't need to write
40:58 dialogue in this but you may want to
41:00 drop a few lines that you're thinking
41:02 about because you want to set the tone
41:03 of how this person talks what if someone
41:05 has a Southern drawl someone has inner
41:09 city accent someone has be real formal
41:12 you know I don't know like a Harvard
41:15 grad or something live you Leaguer
41:17 they're gonna speak different so you
41:19 mean if it's important you may drop it
41:21 in there but the other huge part is what
41:26 are the big action moments and again we
41:29 go back to that function model what's
41:31 going in at the beginning and what's
41:32 coming out at the end something must
41:34 change and turn to make the scene have
41:37 any value and this is where you can
41:39 start valuating your bullets because if
41:41 you realize what one end is pretty much
41:43 what comes out at the bottom you either
41:45 need to clip the scene 100% or rethink
41:48 the scene to really twist things up and
41:51 then that becomes the input for the next
41:53 time those characters have another scene
41:55 so you could be jumping around what if
41:56 you had ten characters like a Marvel
41:58 movie and you're jumping to update
42:00 ant-man update you know Thor each one of
42:04 those guys have something going in
42:05 different things coming out if you go
42:07 back and visit Thor what came out of his
42:09 last scenes was going into the next
42:10 scene and you got to turn it again you
42:13 will find if you're let's say you're not
42:17 a writer but you're willing to listen to
42:18 me talk here's what you'll find you will
42:22 find that because you have lived life
42:24 you have all this empirical data all of
42:27 this cause-and-effect stuff in your head
42:29 that has been your life or been your
42:30 observation of other people's lives
42:32 or all the shows you've seen on TV and
42:34 all the movies you've ever watched
42:35 you have millions of these situations
42:38 and now you get to play with them all
42:41 it's sort of like my analogy of someone
42:45 who learned formal recital music and
42:48 can't write their own music I can't
42:50 understand that because in the end the
42:53 person with the recital knowledge has
42:57 all the keys in their head if I say go
43:00 to E minor they're like okay yeah sure
43:02 now what I'm like well play some of the
43:04 chords in E minor and let's listen to
43:06 them and let's find a progression that
43:08 works let's build some tension let's do
43:10 some release let's do a chorus whatever
43:12 and that's how it works and writing is
43:14 the same exact way now I'm going to move
43:17 on to the next two phases because
43:18 they're gonna be fairly quick and then
43:20 we'll loop back around for the
43:21 collaboration part of it because this is
43:23 where you'll start realizing that you
43:27 probably don't write down everything
43:31 that you're thinking in your head
43:33 especially if you work alone so the next
43:37 step up is actually starting to write
43:39 the script now most of you understand
43:42 that a script really has three basic
43:45 elements it has your your scene
43:49 declaration where are we internal
43:51 external time of day
43:53 next thing is your action now inside
43:56 your action you're going to set up the
43:57 scene and really describe the world that
43:59 they're in anything that's important is
44:01 listed in this paragraph the opening
44:04 paragraph everything that's not
44:05 important you don't type it in screw it
44:08 yeah what you don't care if it's sunny
44:10 up because it doesn't matter and what
44:12 that does is that allows the director to
44:16 look at the scene and go oh you know
44:17 this would be really good in a rainstorm
44:19 now they do want that from you as well
44:21 if it matters but if it doesn't leave it
44:23 open and let them figure it out one of
44:25 the classic problems that people in
44:27 Hollywood who become screenwriters from
44:30 some other technical discipline they
44:32 will want to talk about what cameras
44:35 being used what lens is being used and
44:37 that's just a quick way to get your
44:39 script burned so don't do that remember
44:42 Shakespeare when he wrote wrote no
44:43 action he only wrote the dialogue which
44:45 was what they call the prose right so
44:49 you have scene
44:50 declaration where are we time of day
44:52 then you have your action then you have
44:55 your dialogue and there are there are
44:58 transitions and other things that are
44:59 happening there but you know if you want
45:01 to set up perhaps this is happening in
45:03 1985 I use the transition format which
45:06 is it's it's right justified so to you
45:09 it's over here and I'll just say 1985 or
45:12 whatever it is then the scene then the
45:15 action so the brain is kind of figuring
45:17 out but I will say that a lot of times
45:19 when someone's reading a script they
45:21 don't track to the right to read the
45:23 transitions so I've handed scripts to
45:25 people that if I left justify the year
45:29 then they see it if I write justify in a
45:32 transition they don't see it this is
45:34 funny just as a quick note in case you
45:37 guys want to know usually a professional
45:40 script doesn't have any mores or
45:42 continues at all
45:43 so there's software always tries to help
45:46 you that if someone is speaking you know
45:50 from another page the dialogue cuts the
45:52 page it'll say continued in parenthesis
45:55 or if they speak again it might say I
45:58 can't remember mores or used but turned
46:01 all that crap off just leave it the core
46:04 script people know what's going on okay
46:07 if they're gonna make your film they've
46:08 done it before and they don't need a
46:10 bunch of flowery crap taking up space in
46:12 the script if you need to make a script
46:15 hit a certain page a final draft the
46:18 industry standard for writing scripts
46:20 will play with the margins for you you
46:23 just tell it this is 90 pages I really
46:25 need it to be 110 it goes all right it
46:28 starts spacing everything out it's
46:30 pretty pretty brilliant but now okay so
46:33 you're writing your movie now you're
46:35 using your pre-approved scene breakdown
46:38 everyone's on the same page and let's
46:42 say you have some people from a
46:44 different parts of the world let's say
46:46 you have a guy from Liverpool a kid from
46:53 LA and a country bumpkin from Kansas one
46:58 is twenty five one is forty five the
47:01 other ones six
47:02 five oh man but you need to get the
47:07 script into its first you know
47:10 altogether constructed amalgamation of
47:14 everything you've done the framework
47:15 everything you're done your scene
47:16 breakdown and you just really need to
47:18 get the script you don't want to ever
47:19 create a situation in a creative realm
47:22 where in your first pass you get blocked
47:25 because you're like how would this guy
47:27 see this don't worry about that right
47:29 now
47:30 write it however you would personally
47:33 say it yourself if you don't
47:35 automatically know how someone might say
47:37 this in another dialect language or from
47:40 a different country in general just get
47:43 it down start to finish you'll find that
47:46 that's an ass-kicker all by itself right
47:48 not initially your actions gonna be too
47:52 flowery
47:53 you have overwritten your script a
47:55 little bit your word choices may be poor
47:58 you might pick up some fancy words no
48:01 fancy words and scripts people none the
48:04 only fancy words that ever should accept
48:05 it be accepted in a script would be
48:08 dialog from someone who is trying to
48:10 speak fancy that's it and it's going to
48:12 be one of those situations where you're
48:14 like you're writing Morbius from
48:18 Forbidden Planet who was a PhD linguist
48:21 you had so he already knows how to speak
48:23 English beautifully and he used a
48:25 machine that increased his IQ 300% and
48:29 so that guy's dialogue is going to be
48:31 hefty and it should read hefty shouldn't
48:34 read so bad that are so complicated that
48:36 you can't be spoken by the actor it
48:38 can't be understood by someone in the
48:39 room unless you're really trying to
48:40 create that effect right data from Star
48:45 Trek next generation had a lot of
48:48 interesting dialogue because he was
48:53 seeing the world from an androids
48:55 perspective you know so what's the
48:58 fourth step the fourth step is your
49:02 refinement phase now refinement goes
49:06 without saying so I usually would say
49:08 that might be sort of a fifth step but I
49:12 will tell you you can break it into two
49:14 extra steps I should say so
49:16 I like to do refinement at the very last
49:18 step okay but there will be a face that
49:22 even you will do now there's people in
49:23 Hollywood who are writers that write
49:27 dialogue that's all they do I saw a
49:31 woman get an Oscar for the dialogue
49:33 refinements on Mad Max the remake a very
49:39 beautiful film that had a horrible story
49:42 so I don't know what anyone's getting at
49:44 an Oscar for in that film but whatever
49:47 hats off to anybody can pull it off for
49:50 whatever reason maybe I just missed the
49:51 super impactful story that didn't happen
49:54 but you would then go back to the
49:56 dialogue especially and get the dialects
50:00 correct get the overall inflection
50:02 correct and remember you know one of the
50:05 things I learned as a kid was that you
50:07 know when you're a child you have a hard
50:09 time listening to people talk because
50:12 you're thinking about what you want to
50:13 say you're very narcissistic just in
50:15 general so that's the way you'll write
50:19 your dialogue initially but when someone
50:21 told me once you need to listen to
50:23 people talk and the reason why you want
50:26 to listen to them talk is that they
50:27 believe what they're saying in most
50:29 cases it's important to them every word
50:32 they're choosing is important to them so
50:34 listen because they're trying to give
50:36 you a gift of what's inside their mind
50:38 and so you have to then crawl into these
50:41 characters and it happens naturally if
50:43 you're a writer which any one of you can
50:46 become a writer just by choosing to do
50:47 so but you'll develop a character and
50:51 you have all these ideas for your
50:53 character and your characters fighting
50:54 you and saying I wouldn't talk like that
50:56 I talk like this and they become a
50:58 little mini actors in your brain you
51:00 know what if you told Marlon Brando to
51:02 say it really lousy line in a movie he's
51:05 just gonna look at that and you know I
51:08 don't think so I'll get you there I'll
51:10 get you don't worry about it I'll get
51:12 you there and he just would improvise
51:13 something or write his own line and
51:15 he'll get you there because he was a
51:18 master thesbian
51:19 in his day right for instance I've been
51:24 told several times that Martin Downey
51:25 jr. has his own writing team so when the
51:29 Marvel
51:29 Grif gets turned in his team comes in
51:32 and makes it the Stark the Tony Stark
51:35 dialog the funniness the quickness he
51:39 knows what that character will say and
51:40 what that character won't say so he has
51:42 his own DNA to it either personally or
51:44 he hires his team to do it and that's
51:47 why that character rocks on camera every
51:50 single time so this is a set of steps to
51:56 keep you moving quickly through the
51:57 process because you have a process as
51:59 opposed to just randomly getting there
52:01 and going once he's out of the other
52:02 guys do it I'm telling you how they do
52:04 it at least how I do it that really
52:06 works really really well
52:08 now I'll throw a few tidbits out there
52:11 for refining your script in general that
52:14 I you know I just just said a little bit
52:16 of it but you know the people don't like
52:20 to read scripts almost nobody does maybe
52:24 your readers like to read scripts but a
52:27 layman especially doesn't need a recent
52:29 want to read scripts because they're
52:31 weird they're not like novels which
52:35 really flour up everything by the time
52:36 someone speaks man you have everyone's
52:39 consciousness fully explained on
52:40 previous pages right when you are
52:43 telling a story visually obviously the
52:47 only action that you're going to be able
52:48 to describe is something that's visible
52:51 you can't say what anyone's thinking and
52:54 so everything that they are thinking if
52:56 it's not coming out in spoken language
52:58 which is sort of the cheaper way to live
53:01 on screen the best way to live on screen
53:03 is through action you know an expression
53:07 on of someone's face if it's important
53:09 you may want to throw a little sentence
53:11 in there but now here's what I do to
53:13 keep the the discreet the reading
53:17 process moving very quickly and keep it
53:20 really rewarding and make it such that
53:22 when the reader is giving me the benefit
53:25 of their life to read my script which is
53:28 something I think that you can only
53:30 technically ask someone to do one time
53:32 that's been my experience besides I
53:35 don't even think you can get a
53:36 professional Ryo more than once you
53:38 could show them a particular scene that
53:40 you've refined and then you know maybe
53:43 just
53:43 read this one daily hits like four pages
53:45 or something and hi yeah that's way
53:47 better you know but asking to reread the
53:49 whole thing from start to finish almost
53:51 never so what I do is I take instead of
53:54 writing gigantic paragraphs of action I
53:57 will find any reason in the book to one
54:01 refine every sentence down to its
54:04 shortest possible maximum impact to say
54:08 and portray everything that I need to
54:10 happen inside the camera but my goal is
54:14 always to write one line carries your
54:18 turn you know which gives you a double
54:20 space and then the next line and because
54:25 that's what happens in a script right so
54:28 if you make someone flip the page and
54:30 you've got monster paragraphs I mean you
54:35 better be one of the most masterful
54:37 writers in the world or that better be a
54:41 really important scene it better be a
54:44 something that you have built up so much
54:45 in your script that they want to read
54:49 those paragraphs because they probably
54:50 immediately regardless of how much you
54:53 beef it up they don't want to read it
54:54 now if I were to give a Star Wars fan
54:59 the script for Star Wars 9 oh they're
55:03 gonna read it okay and because they have
55:05 a pre-existing commitment to the script
55:07 but unless it's like that they don't
55:11 usually get through it so you are on the
55:14 hook for every single word and a funny
55:17 little analogy I'll give you if you're
55:20 still trying to piece that together in
55:21 your mind and kind of go what mental
55:22 frame of mind do I get in to make sure
55:25 that every word is refined to its best
55:28 you know version for any of you've ever
55:34 seen a movie where someone sends a
55:35 telegram telegrams were constructed in a
55:41 way that you paid for every word because
55:43 you're asking a dude to tap it out Morse
55:45 code to the next guy who's gonna relay
55:47 to Morse code to the next guy and
55:49 they're they're using their energy and
55:51 you can't have it be free to send a page
55:53 versus a paragraph right because they're
55:56 working really hard they're not
55:57 doing some other job they want to churn
55:59 out as much money in a day as they
56:02 possibly can so words turned into money
56:05 if you ever see the movie three amigos a
56:07 funniest thing that happened in that
56:09 film was that when the the little
56:12 Mexican community who thought the three
56:14 amigos weren't actors that they were
56:15 actually real superheroes has this in
56:18 the telegram to the three amigos they
56:20 don't have enough money to explain the
56:22 whole thing and so the guy who's sending
56:25 the telegram from Mexico to Hollywood he
56:29 helps her refine the language but he
56:31 refines it so much that by the time the
56:34 telegram gets to the three actors they
56:37 think they're putting on a show instead
56:38 of fighting the real bad guy Oh whop oh
56:41 it is one of the most brilliant little
56:44 mechanisms in a script I have ever seen
56:46 it's just great so you are the person
56:49 trying to save as much money as you
56:51 possibly can on the telus telegram that
56:53 is your script now I'm gonna give you
56:57 one little other thing that I've said
56:59 one time because I think it will finish
57:01 up the refinement it kind of broad
57:03 strokes and my other episodes are about
57:05 all of this so get into those and we
57:08 have a screenwriting playlist on YouTube
57:11 so just get into that and the website
57:13 also has it as well in a category list
57:15 which you can find on the front page one
57:20 of the things that I ran into my very
57:22 first film was that I had a telephone
57:24 conversation going back and forth
57:26 between two ladies and I found out that
57:29 in order to really portray the camera
57:31 properly you know you're writing
57:32 internal house one dialogue internal
57:36 house to dialogue and I kept flipping
57:38 back and forth back and forth but the
57:39 dialogue wasn't really heavy because
57:41 it's a high action scene and so I asked
57:44 my mentor I said look what do I do with
57:46 this and I hate flipping the camera
57:48 every single time I want the camera to
57:49 go back and forth between the two women
57:51 talking because it's filling up the page
57:52 with all these breaks and it just looks
57:55 awful in the script and he said oh yeah
57:58 he goes that's that's one of the typical
57:59 ones that happens that you know every
58:01 writer has to deal with and he goes what
58:02 I do is this he goes I flip the camera
58:04 one time and then I just write the
58:06 dialogue back and forth letting the
58:08 director know they're in two different
58:10 location
58:11 cut it however you like so that was a
58:13 brilliant little solution okay now let's
58:16 talk about collaboration for a second I
58:18 will tell you that these phases will
58:22 greatly help your collaboration however
58:26 you know everyone is getting their
58:28 epiphanies about the film you're trying
58:30 to write on a team at these different
58:33 levels right someone's OD'ing on the
58:35 dialect someone's OD'ing on a particular
58:38 spoken sentence at a particular scene
58:41 and so that's where their brain is their
58:43 brain is way up on level three or four
58:46 but you're down there at the frame we're
58:49 going guys help me get the movie put
58:51 together first before you run off and I
58:54 got the believe I made a note about
58:55 these other things being important I'm
58:57 with you on that
58:58 so before you collaborate with anyone on
59:02 a film one if you don't have a process
59:05 collaboration is gonna be a nightmare
59:07 you're probably gonna be kind of written
59:10 off as a rookie and you won't have any
59:12 method of gathering up the cats and
59:15 hurting them right
59:16 you'll be crushing the butterflies as it
59:19 were so you want to sit down with anyone
59:23 you're working with and explain in as
59:26 much detail as they need to know these
59:28 steps this layering cake process
59:31 framework scene breakdown initial script
59:35 refinement of dialogue dialect and of
59:38 course everything else just goes without
59:40 saying refinement in general you will be
59:42 refining everything probably every two
59:46 days once you get the thing finished and
59:48 you get your first giant pass at the
59:50 rewrite which would be now there's two
59:53 types of rewrites there is sort of
59:56 tuning which is considered a new version
59:58 of the script and if you do a full
60:01 rewrite what that typically means is
60:04 someone doesn't like a scene progression
60:06 at all a sequence of scenes they don't
60:09 like it and it's like this doesn't work
60:10 for me which you should have figured out
60:13 in your framework if you did that scene
60:15 if you did that step right and you
60:16 should have figured it out in your scene
60:17 breakdown the most I would say inertia
60:23 that are right
60:24 runs into as if they're being told to do
60:27 a massive rewrite after the script has
60:30 been created so here's my recommendation
60:33 for that kind of massive modification
60:35 you want to go back to your steps start
60:38 off back at the framework write your
60:40 bullets to re-engineer the scene
60:42 maybe those bullets are actually fine
60:44 but your scene breakdown needs to be
60:45 redone because they want a different
60:47 technique of something then go back into
60:49 your screenwriting software and then you
60:51 can use your guide to write that in your
60:53 screen soft when it won't hurt so much
60:54 right it won't be like a Kotik all this
60:56 is like a bunch of you know teacups and
60:59 saucers balanced on each other and if I
61:01 touch one it all falls and breaks down
61:02 that's the feeling you might get but the
61:05 toughest thing in collaboration and
61:08 they'll say everybody understands the
61:09 process and everyone's actually capable
61:11 of disciplining themselves into those
61:14 containers right and you know might just
61:16 be hey here's a note about the dialog
61:18 thing I want you to remember boof and
61:20 then you put it on that layer three and
61:21 uh you know I really would like this
61:23 what I used to live in England guys from
61:25 Liverpool would always say this I really
61:27 want that to be said that goes on the
61:29 stage for so you're you're gathering
61:31 everything they feel confident that you
61:33 have listened to them and you got that
61:36 in the script but what you'll find if
61:39 you're anything like me is that because
61:43 you're visual meaning very right brain
61:47 there is a bit of there's a bit of
61:52 toughness being very analytical and left
61:55 brain in your words to other people and
62:00 so you will have a very amazing fleshed
62:04 out seeing that the room is perfect the
62:07 lighting is perfect
62:08 everybody's clothing is perfect the
62:12 dialogue is just beautiful tension and
62:15 release positive negative charge
62:17 changing go see Robert McKee spoke on my
62:20 previous lessons to understand what that
62:22 means if you don't but if you don't
62:24 write it down they have no clue that
62:27 you're having this amazing epiphany in
62:29 this beautiful vision so you have to
62:33 survey what you have written to
62:35 communicate it to another human being
62:38 and the thing you will find out is that
62:43 everyone has an internal tolerance level
62:46 and they have a tempo that they ingest
62:50 the world by some people really lay back
62:52 very unethical and they're meant for
62:55 this job and they read a lot and so you
62:58 give them a script two pages a page
63:01 doesn't matter
63:01 they just sit down and boom they ingest
63:04 that thing and they see it in their mind
63:06 they have a few different ideas that you
63:08 don't have because they're different
63:08 human being than you but they generally
63:10 get it other folks are live in really
63:13 fast life's they're busy for other
63:15 reasons they can't get through a page
63:17 and then you show up and you try to talk
63:20 about it and they've only read a page
63:22 but there's like eight pages and you're
63:24 going oh my god you've had this for a
63:25 week what's the deal something stopped
63:28 them and so you have to figure out the
63:31 best way to communicate with person a
63:33 and then the best way to communicate
63:35 with person B if their strengths and
63:38 weaknesses in different individuals you
63:42 might send one person a certain format
63:44 and another person in the format you may
63:45 even realize this person doesn't read
63:47 and so you have to meet them in person
63:50 and then you have to have a script for
63:53 yourself to pitch them almost like
63:56 you're in an elevator you got your movie
63:57 idea you meet a big producer a Steven
63:59 Spielberg got this thing you know this
64:01 lets sequel something blah blah or
64:03 whatever it goes without saying that
64:06 guy's not gonna have a lot of time to
64:07 listen to you and he just won't because
64:10 he's living his life right so the early
64:16 phases of developing a script are a lot
64:18 different than a pre-approved script
64:21 going to a director I would wager that
64:27 you can pick any popular director you
64:29 know from JJ Abrams to George Lucas they
64:34 don't get partial scripts unless they
64:37 are collaborating with each other or
64:39 collaborating with a particular writer
64:41 and they're under the understanding
64:42 you're gonna get this early version of
64:44 the script and it's going to be missing
64:46 things but I wanted you to see it early
64:47 not that uh
64:49 hmm they are going to most likely
64:52 depending on their contribution if
64:54 they're not writing it themselves
64:56 they're getting a finished product it's
64:59 already been through 20 readers it's
65:01 already been refined it's at draft 25
65:04 you know which is probably of minor
65:06 changes with the few rewrites so when
65:09 you're in early development phase you're
65:12 not working with that level of quality
65:13 plus you're not working with final
65:15 decisions in a lot of cases you're still
65:17 drumming up ideas about how to
65:18 accomplish something and if something
65:20 can be accomplished 100 different ways
65:22 well how many are you gonna write down
65:25 and then how many are they going to
65:26 think up and then you have to resolve it
65:29 and then what if you hate all of your
65:30 ideas but you really you know you're
65:33 gonna make this film you're gonna get it
65:34 done you're gonna crack it and the
65:36 beautiful thing is the more you paced
65:38 around your house and talking to your
65:39 dictaphone and and think things through
65:43 you will find solutions I mean it is the
65:45 wildest thing and it changes your
65:47 perception of your entire life because
65:50 every other place in your life that you
65:52 thought you couldn't do something once
65:54 you do it in script writing you're like
65:56 well okay we got to get this done how am
65:59 I gonna get this done it's like the old
66:01 Apollo 13 story you know how we're gonna
66:02 get these guys back safe know they can
66:04 go in space anyway but anyway they get
66:08 together and put the paperclip in the
66:13 rubber band together and they get it
66:14 done and that's what you're gonna do as
66:16 a writer now the other thing that
66:19 happens to collaboration is you may sit
66:23 down and have your framework pretty well
66:27 approved by the people you're working
66:29 with
66:30 and then as you break it down things
66:34 become evident that weren't evident in
66:36 your little bullets in your framework
66:39 and so now everyone's looking I go and
66:41 you know I thought that was gonna work
66:42 but now I have to think about that he
66:44 wouldn't do that if this guy was this
66:45 way or that way and then some part of
66:48 the script if not all of the scripts
66:50 goes back to Ground Zero and that just
66:54 happens and again you have to be a
66:55 person who who loves it you know
66:59 you know as much as I'm sure formula 1
67:02 racers hate having their cars you know
67:04 just power down in the middle of a race
67:07 like oh my god I lost power I don't have
67:08 anything and they pull over the side of
67:10 the road and out of the race the driver
67:13 has one perspective of that process
67:15 which is dammit I didn't finish the race
67:17 I'm not gonna have any position my
67:20 circuit score is going to go down and
67:22 any hopes I have for taking the the
67:25 division championship or whatever is
67:27 gone you know but the mechanic who gets
67:31 the car back with a problem if they're
67:34 like I work in Formula One I love doing
67:37 this job they can't wait to pull the
67:39 bodywork off pull the engine apart and
67:43 find out what the hell went wrong
67:44 because they know one thing the more
67:47 that they solve these problems of a
67:51 particular kind the less they're ever
67:52 going to occur ever and so the next race
67:55 that thing will never happen again as
67:58 long as that person and the team can
68:00 remember remember last time we lost
68:01 power because this little thing was this
68:03 way let's make sure that didn't happen
68:05 add it to the checklist of stuff that we
68:07 made sure doesn't happen well that'll
68:10 happen in scripts as well
68:11 it'll happen between the people and so
68:14 what's nice about it is especially if
68:16 you're privileged to work with the team
68:18 for a long time like Stanley Kubrick I
68:20 think geez by the mid 60s he had just
68:24 you know hired people tested the mouth
68:26 vetted them some worked out some didn't
68:28 but all the ones that worked out by at
68:30 least the early seventies you know as I
68:32 understand it he worked with the same
68:34 group his whole life and you know maybe
68:37 if someone passed away they didn't went
68:39 on the team but other than that I think
68:42 he was largely outlived by most of his
68:44 you know crew and so that's how you can
68:50 work it as well to make sure within this
68:52 this paradigm you might work on a show
68:54 and it's very conducive to creativity
68:58 and then change shows and and you're
69:01 being hazed you know you never know but
69:06 you have to love the process so the
69:09 reason why I'm making these episodes
69:11 virtually and
69:13 every situation I know their books out
69:16 there they do a much better job at you
69:19 know having a lot more real estate to
69:20 talk about this kind of stuff and I'll
69:21 have more experience than myself but
69:24 what's interesting is if you came to my
69:26 house and you saw the books I have on
69:29 screenwriting it's probably a good four
69:32 feet of books on a bookshelf from
69:36 cinematography to writing probably about
69:38 a third of them are just writing and so
69:41 I have ingested a bunch of different
69:44 perspectives and this is the stuff
69:48 that's just I haven't found anywhere
69:50 there's no process out there and what's
69:53 really weird about most of the books
69:54 that I put together Sid fields is the
69:57 most revealing perhaps you might say
70:03 full disclosure kind of guy he basically
70:07 said everything that I think that guy
70:08 understands about scripts and so he is
70:10 probably the biggest thing but he's a
70:12 little antiquated today
70:13 whereas McKee is is the super hardcore
70:17 version of it and I would say this if
70:19 you wanted a this is gonna be a weird
70:21 analogy if you don't have any of this
70:23 background this may not hit you as hard
70:24 as it would but if any of you guys have
70:26 dealt with cars in your lifetime and
70:28 your 40 or so right for those of you who
70:31 are younger just imagine this my
70:36 training in cars was in the Midwest from
70:40 station wagons to pickup trucks to hot
70:43 rod cars participating in at full-on
70:47 levels of people giving me tasks to put
70:49 things together but most the time just
70:51 watching masters you know rebuild
70:53 engines and then when I came to
70:55 California my first job was working for
70:58 Jim Hall jr. racing and even their
71:01 little two cycle engines I got to see
71:02 other bigger engines and I got to hear
71:04 all this theory of you know pipes
71:07 instead of mufflers and you know
71:10 compression of the of the engine and how
71:14 you would pull out the exhaust quicker
71:16 but the other thing is like the
71:17 gearboxes being rebuilt for particular
71:19 tracks big long run you know
71:21 straightaways your gearbox one way lots
71:23 of tight turns you
71:25 box a different way and so when up to in
71:27 the next level and so I would say Sid
71:30 fields is a great sort of core mechanic
71:34 he will teach you what different parts
71:36 do you know the carburetor versus of the
71:39 Pistons versus the valves and all that
71:40 kinda see teaches you all the basics and
71:42 you have to know that to do what you
71:44 need to do Robert McKee is your formula
71:48 one we assume you know all this now let
71:51 me take you to the next level
71:53 Robert is also brilliant at opening up
71:56 the human mind to you one of the best
71:59 courses he teaches is his genre course
72:01 which when I took it was four days and
72:04 it covered love stories action thrillers
72:09 comedies and one other one that I can't
72:13 think of at the moment but the guy broke
72:15 down love for us he broke down comedy
72:18 you know he's the one that taught me
72:20 here I was by the time I took the class
72:22 on genre I had managed comedians for
72:25 seven years in Los Angeles just as a
72:28 side thing for my buddies that were
72:29 comedians and you know I had written
72:33 really funny little comedy pieces in
72:36 high school all the way up into
72:38 screenwriting I've always been a kind of
72:40 a little prankster there but I didn't
72:42 know what made me laugh and McKee said
72:45 look what makes you laugh is two
72:46 completely ridiculous or I shouldn't say
72:50 ridiculous but two concepts that don't
72:52 belong together being slammed together
72:54 in your brain and that makes you go oh
72:57 and you laugh because you have no other
73:00 emotion to give to the the weird
73:02 contradiction in your mind next time you
73:05 hear a comedian do their stand-up watch
73:08 them they're setting it up with a and
73:11 they're slamming it with B and you laugh
73:12 and the and the B don't naturally go
73:15 together
73:15 and that's what's so damn funny that's
73:18 why the what was that the Seinfeld thing
73:23 I think he even made fun of which was
73:24 Khomeini's ago up what's up with that
73:26 you know two things to go to it what's
73:27 up with that and they're trying to
73:29 emphasize the difference in a really
73:32 silly way and a repetitive way so I
73:35 think that's all I have about that so
73:37 let's just review real quick
73:38 you have your obviously your premise
73:41 which is going to feel your story that's
73:43 what you just have to have on paper
73:44 before you can do anything else that's
73:46 where you have a story to tell the more
73:49 clever your premise the story ends up
73:51 writing itself if you build your
73:53 characters properly by the way this
73:55 story really just has so many options
73:57 it's ridiculous if you build your
73:59 characters wrong and make a bunch of
74:01 decisions about them ahead of time you
74:03 can get yourself locked where you can't
74:05 move anymore
74:06 so don't try to make too many decisions
74:08 about upper level concepts until you
74:11 know you have a chance to live in like a
74:14 free society of your mind because in the
74:17 end your film was only gonna get made if
74:20 people gonna watch it and so if you pick
74:23 John raise their old and tired for the
74:25 time that you're in the studios are
74:28 gonna go look we don't need another one
74:29 of those you know there's like 50 years
74:32 of that don't need that anymore you need
74:34 to juice it up somehow and so you know
74:38 the other one is I'll give you two
74:40 examples if you were to write something
74:45 for children that's really aimed at kids
74:48 like a Barney type episode that's turned
74:51 into a movie automatically the studios
74:54 are going to go okay we're only
74:55 demographic anyone's ever gonna bring to
74:57 this movie which with Alice in
75:00 Wonderland for instance with Tim Burton
75:02 directing the dude made over two billion
75:05 dollars I mean that movie made a
75:06 tremendous amount of money and nobody
75:08 knows it it's really funny because
75:10 little girls wanted to use the movie as
75:12 a birthday part of their birthday take
75:14 all the kids down theaters see it so it
75:16 made a ton of money and it sold well at
75:19 the at the Home Office too right but it
75:24 starts to potentially constrict your
75:27 audience that could go see it let's say
75:31 you create something that's really dark
75:33 right now
75:35 like there's everybody's really trying
75:37 to create dark there's a lot of narco
75:40 episodes on Netflix and specials but
75:44 let's think about him we've lived in a
75:46 war on terror now for 18 years we've had
75:50 school shootings
75:52 for 15 years we've had beheadings people
75:56 being burned in cages and all this dark
75:59 dark why do people go to movies
76:02 they go to movies to escape Snow White
76:06 in the Seven Dwarfs released in 1936
76:11 blew up and gave Walt Disney enough
76:14 money to start his empire where he
76:17 didn't have to beg for money anymore
76:18 until he had to make his amusement park
76:20 but it gave him so much money he could
76:23 do what he needed to do but why did it
76:24 blow up what was going on 1936 a
76:27 depression a horrible gold seizing
76:33 depression there were 2 years into the
76:35 massive depression people are soup lines
76:37 so yeah how did this movie make a
76:40 tremendous amount of money when the
76:42 United States of America was at 36%
76:44 unemployment because even if you had a
76:46 dime you go see that movie because you
76:50 need to forget this nightmare that you
76:51 live in so try not to create more
76:53 nightmares in the genre that you're
76:56 living in
76:56 right so escape is always a great thing
76:59 and it could even be as intense as or as
77:03 simple as I should say you were creating
77:05 a sci-fi movie you think oh my god I'm
77:07 creating a sci-fi movies gonna totally
77:09 provide escapism during an era of terror
77:12 and war but your movies about terror and
77:14 war and the you know the the deaths are
77:17 really graphic and look maybe you create
77:21 a much simpler movie it's got a big
77:26 beautiful fun uptick and the tension is
77:29 only in the actors you know overcoming
77:32 obstacles and disagreeing with each
77:34 other but it's not CG monster
77:36 chewing a guy in half right if you can
77:40 make it funny then maybe you got a game
77:42 going there so just be aware of what's
77:44 going on watch my other episodes if you
77:46 really want to be serious and this is
77:47 your very first episode you've ever seen
77:49 or at the second episode oh yeah I think
77:53 it's not good on that one please know
77:55 that deep thoughts radio is a variety
77:57 show if you want to think about deep
77:59 thoughts I don't give this analogy very
78:01 often but it's it's sort of its own
78:03 little Coast to Coast AM you know
78:05 we just have a different discipline for
78:07 what constitutes an episode if you do
78:09 have suggestions for episodes please
78:11 throw them in the comment section on
78:12 YouTube because I could definitely use
78:13 some for season 5 here I've got quite a
78:17 few in the queue now I think I've got
78:19 like five more in the queue so I I got
78:22 you covered for a while but you know if
78:25 I'm down for a while because I don't
78:27 have to record any new episodes and you
78:28 give me one that needs a little bit of
78:29 research and you could hit the sweet
78:32 spot where I can go in and look at
78:34 something but if you have minted deep
78:37 thoughts radio Calm please go
78:38 that's where everything is and I must
78:40 say a little bumper here in the middle
78:42 of the bumper of the clothes is that
78:46 YouTube is definitely up to some pretty
78:50 sketchy stuff and so you know we don't
78:54 cover stuff that's insane
78:57 much but we have comfort stuff that's
78:59 the same so we might have episodes
79:02 completely shut off meaning you know
79:06 unlisted they don't necessarily send you
79:09 any notice about this but I guess what
79:11 they're doing is they shut down the
79:12 channel while they purge I don't know
79:16 why that would be necessary you could
79:17 just do it live but in December I think
79:21 it's December 10th or something of 2019
79:23 they're going to roll out a whole new
79:24 policy and they've actually said if your
79:29 channel isn't commercially viable by
79:32 their definition they may turn off your
79:34 channel 100% so it's a nice way to you
79:37 know clip the First Amendment there you
79:41 know in in you know I hate to even
79:44 defend this action in any way shape or
79:46 form if this were like a television
79:49 station they do the same thing they do
79:52 it all the time we don't talk about
79:53 those things we're trying to create a
79:55 certain feeling with our brand so in
79:58 some ways they could definitely defend
80:00 themselves a hundred percent so the
80:03 reason why you need to go to deep
80:04 thoughts radio Calm is because if we
80:06 ever have to switch services say
80:09 exclusively to bits shoot in which all
80:11 the episodes are now in good shoot which
80:13 is beautiful it is all 1080p so I shoot
80:17 everything in 4k and edit everything in
80:18 Fork
80:19 I'll even the intros in 4k that'll be
80:23 the only place you can get it so that
80:25 would super suck so let's do me a favor
80:29 because I don't usually ask for this
80:31 sort of thing put the channel everywhere
80:34 put it everywhere let's try to bump the
80:37 stats up on this channel in a huge way
80:41 such that when they come around look at
80:43 the commercial viability maybe as a
80:45 factor I don't know you know there's the
80:47 guys that cover q and the guys that
80:49 cover deep conspiracies they're probably
80:51 screwed honestly they don't have
80:53 necessarily kind of an open educational
80:56 thing like we have where we can talk
80:59 about anything that we want so if they
81:01 strike us out of a certain flavor of
81:04 content we're gonna have most of our
81:07 videos up there probably an out of 450 I
81:10 would be shocked if we have 50 that
81:13 cross the line but even if we did we
81:15 still have 400 to play with and you
81:16 could always get those on shoot
81:19 and for the website because if the web
81:20 starts website starts having holes in it
81:23 because of censorship I'll just swap it
81:26 out for the 1080p version at shoot
81:28 and we'll we'll be on our merry way but
81:32 that brings me to the website so it has
81:34 two options for video obviously YouTube
81:36 is one of them it's the biggest one with
81:39 filling forty two hundred and fifty-five
81:41 subscribers right now
81:43 that should be way way higher based on
81:45 other channels I've seen that produced
81:47 crap but part of it is the play length
81:51 of an episode scares away a lot of the
81:52 trolls so we we don't have a lot of
81:54 trolls either but get over to bid shoot
81:57 everybody's saying it everybody's doing
81:59 it get yourself an account the channel
82:02 over there is deep thoughts radio and so
82:04 it's really easy to find but get over
82:06 there make an account even if you don't
82:07 want to watch anything else but you
82:09 creates one you'll always have me in
82:12 your back pocket if you do that but too
82:15 it gives the platform support which will
82:17 entice investors to help them out it's
82:20 so important their user account needs to
82:22 blow up so I figured out they're
82:26 uploading issues some folks are still
82:27 dealing with it essentially you need to
82:30 what happens is this
82:32 shoot if you ever want to use
82:33 shoot if you load your channel page and
82:36 then go to bed get up the next day and
82:39 don't reload the page but you started
82:41 upload it has lost the link to your
82:44 account when you hit the upload button
82:45 the upload button is an expiring button
82:47 but they don't tell you that the link to
82:50 the server that's gonna take your video
82:52 no longer knows who you are so if you
82:54 don't refresh your shoot page then
82:58 hit the upload button your upload will
83:00 just go off into the ether and will
83:02 never process and never go public so
83:04 that's the reason why it's having an
83:05 issue but we have plenty of podcast
83:08 links on the website just go there with
83:10 the device you wanna listen to your
83:11 podcast hit the link it'll automatically
83:13 link to your software you'll be good to
83:14 go we have three social media outlets
83:19 right now I'm not sure minds.com is
83:22 gonna make it I want it and put it up
83:23 there anyway so obviously have a LOC
83:25 Facebook group so I'm the greatest folks
83:27 out there the next one is Twitter I just
83:29 put the feet up there in case you want
83:30 to tweet things around it's starting to
83:32 pick up a little bit of traffic over
83:35 there so I'm actually pretty surprised
83:37 and encouraged mines is just like
83:39 Facebook you have to have an account to
83:40 see anything but it's up there deep
83:42 thoughts radio it is actually much more
83:45 beautiful than Facebook so I hope mines
83:49 succeeds but we'd have to convince all
83:53 of our friends to go over there and just
83:55 stop using Facebook but the nice thing
83:57 is it's it respects the First Amendment
84:00 just like it does so it's a
84:01 beautiful thing now I do have revenue
84:05 generating on YouTube and revenue
84:08 options through patreon which is where
84:12 you sign up for a monthly little
84:13 donation and it lets ounds crazy and
84:15 it's gooey and I don't want to put my
84:17 credit card out there totally respect
84:19 that if you don't do that we do have ten
84:22 folks to donate at this point
84:23 thirty-five dollars a month so to every
84:25 single one of you you're in the credits
84:26 the way I my policy is if you ever
84:29 donate one month you're gonna go in the
84:30 credits for the rest of your life so
84:31 enjoy that
84:34 let's make that go like 10 minutes at
84:36 the end of the phone would be great but
84:38 I also have PayPal we've had a couple
84:40 people donate to PayPal so I don't know
84:41 who you are but again I'm always going
84:43 to thank you for that and
84:46 we have two products that i promote ones
84:48 the brave browser supposedly there's
84:51 some affiliate program with that i made
84:52 no money off that i don't even know how
84:54 that it really links to me at all but
84:57 you need to get the brave browser
84:58 because it shuts off all the tracking so
85:01 the deep state gets their eye poked out
85:02 which is nice if you switch the search
85:05 engine from Google to DuckDuckGo one
85:08 you're gonna get a much better search
85:09 engine to find everything that's being
85:11 blocked it's a little slower sometimes
85:13 because it it's not you know financed by
85:16 the deep state so but it's worth it it's
85:18 worth it to have no one tracking you
85:20 DuckDuckGo has no metrics behind the
85:23 scenes they don't care the the old cache
85:26 things that are very popular or not
85:28 cache your custom we're in search so
85:30 that's why the more bizarre your search
85:32 is the longer it'll take okay the other
85:35 one is back plays backup software I'm
85:37 just telling everyone about my friends
85:39 like I don't wanna hear anybody come in
85:41 the room losing stuff on their hard
85:44 drives when you could pay seven bucks a
85:46 month you have infinite storage on two
85:48 different computers I mean you could
85:50 have a petabyte of storage at your house
85:53 on one computer or two computers and it
85:56 will back up everything and you can mark
85:58 things not to be backed up really need
86:00 don't backup my personal the stuff here
86:02 and there and I want this I don't my
86:03 pictures up there whatever you should
86:05 because if your house burns down you're
86:07 totally screwed and just as a shout out
86:12 to our we have two moderators Kaz and
86:15 Dave they're amazing people Kaz was in
86:19 Texas and his house got destroyed by a
86:22 tornado
86:22 you could ask Cass what it's like to
86:25 have your possessions petition it
86:27 potentially obliterated so it is not a
86:29 fun experience and because we do not
86:31 print our photos out anymore but even if
86:34 you did you would lose your photo albums
86:36 and a fire you lose a photo albums you
86:38 know if you don't my dad does this
86:40 brilliant thing he makes the books I
86:42 think he uses Kodak but I think they're
86:44 little expenses he switches somebody
86:46 else but anyway he prints out these
86:47 beautiful books from whatever event we
86:50 have together and he mails them to
86:51 everybody so if his house were to
86:53 completely burn to the ground
86:54 everyone's got the photos and hardback
86:56 it's
86:57 it's actually something I don't know why
87:00 we don't do it more I need to do it - I
87:02 think we're scared of the cost but it's
87:04 really not more expensive than
87:06 developing film back in the day so keep
87:08 that in the back in your back pocket now
87:10 if you're looking for season one on this
87:12 channel you're not going to find it it's
87:13 a link on the website just go there
87:15 click it you're good to go and with that
87:19 until the next episode take care of
87:22 yourself and someone else and I'll see
87:23 you in the next deep thoughts over now
