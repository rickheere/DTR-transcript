00:02 [Music]
00:23 you
00:24 [Music]
00:34 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:36 deep thoughts today I'm gonna take a
00:42 user question a fewer question excuse me
00:45 I write too much software I apologize
00:49 the handle I believe is drastic rebel
00:54 makes a lot of good comments
00:56 he/she what have you asked me why do you
01:03 suppose I'm paraphrasing that NASA and
01:09 all the space agencies are faking all
01:12 the aspects of the space program and I
01:18 think that's a great question because I
01:21 think that there's a knee-jerk response
01:23 to the question and I then I think
01:25 there's a much deeper potentially a much
01:28 deeper question on one spectrum of the
01:32 answer one could say money just as
01:36 simple as that money and when you
01:38 launder money you get to steal well I
01:42 should say this if you launder money
01:44 through projects okay
01:47 $12,000 toilet seat obviously a toilet
01:50 seats gonna put you out maybe ten
01:53 dollars if you're the government because
01:54 you're gonna get them in bulk so what do
01:56 you do with the other gazillion billion
01:58 dollars that you charge for the thing we
02:02 know that there's alphabet agencies that
02:05 have had the luxury since the nineteen
02:10 why should say since pretty much most of
02:12 the 20th century they act against the
02:16 people 24/7 to serve the banking
02:19 oligarchy it's a big [ __ ] game they
02:21 love watching the world burn they
02:23 technically hate themselves each
02:25 individual that's willing to work for
02:27 these organizations they have zero
02:32 capability of feeling empathy and so
02:38 they're just stealing the money on this
02:39 side so they can controls so that's one
02:41 side the answer the other side of the
02:43 answer is way over here and you
02:46 I guess well within the membrane of
02:51 conspiracy I say I would think that the
02:55 most outrageous definition would be sort
03:01 of a heaven and hell thing where
03:06 supposedly maybe demons are here on
03:08 earth and earth is not a ball it's a
03:12 flat disc round it's bordered in by the
03:16 ice barriers of the Antarctica and this
03:21 is a holy war it's been going on
03:24 truly a holy war Satan his minions
03:29 against God his angels right game in the
03:32 century the next one down well lay all
03:37 these out and then we can kind of have
03:39 fun with the responses well the next one
03:42 down would be that somehow man has
03:47 reached the edge of the dome the flatter
03:55 disc snow globe dome probably in most
03:58 conspiracy circles that would have been
03:59 Adolf Hitler and his Nazis it is really
04:05 [ __ ] weird that the guy went down
04:06 south right in the middle of what he was
04:08 doing at no point was Hitler doing
04:11 anything other than preparing for war or
04:14 going to war or being in war so to take
04:17 a little break hey let's go to south
04:19 let's go to the Antarctica and hang out
04:21 you know there's well they wanted to
04:24 hire hide u-boats down there and that
04:26 kind of thing which okay long ways away
04:29 to hide a [ __ ] u-boat people why not
04:32 go off the coast of Africa the coast of
04:36 South America
04:38 but in any way human beings find the
04:41 edge of this dome and in their hubris
04:43 not us these people they decided to deny
04:50 us our closeness in proximity with the
04:55 Creator again we're talking about 500
04:58 years ago so I
04:59 portray it as being SuperDuper recent
05:04 but we're talking about the space
05:05 programs well the space programs do this
05:07 right so people have named the Jesuits
05:13 it's funny how there's just like a
05:15 cyclical bad guy you know at one point
05:18 it's you know 10 years ago was Jews Jews
05:21 Jews and now it's the white Jesuits but
05:24 before that it was the Masonic I think
05:27 then it was the Bohemian Grove folks you
05:29 know I don't know I don't know if every
05:32 party's really trying to play in the
05:35 control group you know it could be that
05:37 a bunch of these people were just
05:38 proxies of other control groups and they
05:40 all go to do something in some place but
05:45 anyway mankind gets involved and wants
05:47 to keep man away from God now here's
05:52 here's my rub on that one you mean to
05:56 tell me that God excuse me that man
06:00 reached the basically the front door to
06:03 the Almighty Creator and had the balls
06:06 to say you know what I am going to keep
06:11 everyone inside this place away from you
06:15 you know [ __ ] you God I'm gonna win this
06:18 game I don't think there's a mentally
06:21 sane person on earth that would ever go
06:24 to the Dome wall and flip their bird at
06:27 what they perceived to be a crater on
06:28 the other side I don't buy that at all I
06:31 heard a theory once of British man this
06:35 guy man he was a card he was giving some
06:39 presentation at college super nerdy guy
06:44 all these guys that needs attention and
06:47 he was actually saying yeah this was a
06:50 close relationship with beings from
06:52 another dimension he even stood at the
06:57 podium and attempted he said you know
06:59 when they speak you can't really
07:01 understand them because they speak way
07:03 out of the phonetic range of normal you
07:07 know hearing so he's read a few sci-fi
07:09 books and watched a few movies and then
07:12 he
07:12 he goes blonde I've learned how to speak
07:15 their language let me show you and it's
07:17 he was talking dolphin you know he was
07:20 just right it's like Yoko Ono [ __ ] up
07:23 some priceless moment in time right
07:26 anyway what his story was talking about
07:30 is the different races of aliens that
07:33 come and the fact that they actually are
07:37 keeping us slaves inside this place and
07:40 for them for him I believe it was a
07:42 round ball the heel centric but he
07:45 showed a couple logos where the earth is
07:48 inside of a grid and he said that that
07:51 was a sign of those they're involved
07:53 with the true cabal which is that when
07:56 you die your soul is supposed to leave
07:57 this planet enjoying the rest of the
07:59 souls in the universe but that this
08:01 alien race has constructed this
08:04 essentially soul force field around the
08:06 earth and your soul goes up and bounces
08:08 off and comes back and then they grab
08:10 you and they hold you down and you're
08:12 like in some penal system or some
08:14 bizarre petri dish for these aliens
08:17 again you know all these stories always
08:21 lack any true cost-benefit analysis of
08:25 anyone conducting these rituals right I
08:29 don't know I mean what makes more sense
08:33 to me is the twilight zone with a little
08:34 girl it's got the couple in her in her
08:37 little fake neighborhood you know they
08:39 wake up and inside of a dollhouse but
08:41 kinda looks like a real house but when
08:43 they try to open a door it pops off and
08:46 it's just flat wood underneath or some
08:48 glue and there's David Ickes realm of
08:52 lizard people the lizard theory is kind
08:56 of sort of split into two
08:58 I think it's calmed down quite a bit
09:00 recently but you know one of them his
09:02 theory is that they are you know the
09:04 queen is truly one of these
09:06 shape-shifting lizards you know it's
09:10 almost like the was it the Douglas Adams
09:15 incredible bug blaster beast of trial or
09:18 whatever the hell it was it could
09:19 shape-shift
09:19 if you shape-shift so much and you stay
09:22 in a human form then the idea that you
09:24 would have in
09:25 sort of predisposition towards the shape
09:27 of a lizard the sort of silly right
09:29 you're sort of this nebulous thing you
09:31 can be anything that you want the idea
09:33 that you would be called a reptilian is
09:36 just again it's pulled from Carl Sagan's
09:39 book the analyze and age-old theory of
09:42 the reptile inner core of man right and
09:46 and non empathetic survivalist beast now
09:51 why a [ __ ] reptile
09:52 I don't know right you know I would much
09:55 rather be likened to a lion you know the
09:59 nice long mane its dominating the
10:04 landscape of Africa right you know it's
10:07 just like I don't know anyway but the
10:09 other side of the of the reptilian
10:12 theory is that they are not truly
10:15 reptilians that shape-shift and human
10:17 beings they're merely spiritual and they
10:20 possess the the soul relationship with
10:24 your body getting you to do things that
10:26 they want you to do and again for every
10:30 person who comes into the comments
10:32 section and says well I've seen a
10:33 reptilian you know okay you're gonna
10:38 make an outrageous claim like that and
10:39 just be like one little half partial
10:41 sentence I've seen reptiles right here
10:43 it's like okay we'll give me your story
10:46 help me out here right for people to
10:50 come in and you know get all again but
10:52 heard about people believing that the
10:54 world is anything other than a flat disc
10:58 prove it [ __ ] prove it you know
11:01 just do me that favor don't come in with
11:03 a huge attitude come in with your
11:05 opinion that's different than mine or
11:06 whatever different than everyone else's
11:08 but don't come in with this sort of
11:10 you're a [ __ ] idiot attitude because
11:13 it only makes you look like an absolute
11:15 [ __ ] if I tell you this [ __ ] place
11:17 is flat and it's a round disc and I'm
11:19 telling you that I have no doubt in my
11:22 mind the very next thing out of my mouth
11:24 is the categorical proof of such a claim
11:27 right I believe the world of Caesar
11:30 century why do I believe the world's
11:32 heliocentric because of expanding earth
11:34 what the hell are our continents doing
11:36 all connecting together on all
11:39 it's tearing apart as it were right a
11:42 disc doesn't need that this doesn't need
11:45 to split apart as a matter of fact if
11:47 any of you have taken you know to two
11:50 surfaces that are together and you pull
11:52 them apart as a joint in a disc right
11:55 the back one back side stays close
11:58 together and the in tips get really far
12:00 away that's not what we're seeing right
12:03 maybe there's some logic to it but
12:05 you're gonna have to own that if you
12:06 want to refute it right so I go down
12:10 those initial paths because I want
12:12 people to understand sort of the you
12:14 know if we're gonna answer this question
12:16 of why the space agencies would fake
12:19 space there's a lot of religions out
12:20 there online that will fight over the
12:25 answer my just layman suspicions we're
12:31 gonna go down to the pass here my
12:33 layman's suspicion is is strictly the
12:35 financial one initially you know most
12:40 scams are not scams right from the very
12:43 beginning they were events serendipitous
12:47 events just chance happenings where
12:49 someone made a ton of cash and then all
12:52 of a sudden someone goes where did that
12:56 come from well you know this thing
12:58 happened this thing fell over there and
12:59 you know my chocolate got it in my
13:01 peanut butter and Kapow Reese's alright
13:07 so there was this big pissing contest to
13:10 own space I have to say just the very
13:15 notion of that idea was was just
13:21 absolutely stunning but someone said you
13:24 know dig about this we've never been in
13:26 space before ever ever ever yeah you
13:29 shoot rockets up in the air but they
13:31 come back down right at the time that we
13:34 are trying to figure out how the world's
13:38 put together and how the universe is put
13:40 together and again it was a very slow
13:41 process the last 500 600 years you know
13:46 first the thing is round but earth is in
13:48 the center of the universe then it's
13:49 round but earth goes around the Sun then
13:52 we
13:53 postulate the galaxies and we're this
13:57 little speck of dust in these spiral
14:00 wings of a galaxy and then then you know
14:04 this is what's kind of funny then the
14:06 galaxies are tiny specks of nothing as
14:08 well because the universe is so big
14:10 isn't it interesting that the the design
14:14 principle of all theories outside of
14:17 Flat Earth is how [ __ ] insignificant
14:20 we are the second we kind of grasp you
14:23 know us being at the center universe ah
14:25 no can't be at the center universe it's
14:27 all 666 all the way around right Sun
14:32 goes through the galaxy it's 666
14:34 thousand miles an hour we go around the
14:36 Sun six hundred 666666 does that make
14:51 the forgery is pretty amazing we know
14:56 we've got so much wrong in the [ __ ]
15:00 classrooms of this world it blows the
15:03 mind now just that's way before you get
15:06 to lying about going to the moon going
15:10 to Mars
15:11 like yesterday the robot lands on Mars
15:15 and gives us this crusty ass shot of
15:18 Mars through some you know transparent
15:21 camera lens cover or something right
15:25 again there is no goddamn excuse on
15:28 planet Earth why we shouldn't have
15:30 continuous shots of these vehicles
15:32 landing wherever the hell they're
15:34 landing remember Titan remember the
15:36 satellite that landed supposedly on the
15:39 moon of Saturn it's spinning around like
15:43 crazy and it's shooting all this crazy
15:45 stuff and then we got a shot for like a
15:47 few seconds and then it was over
15:48 was this a joke is this a joke that that
15:52 thing could take a shot for just a
15:54 little while and never another shot
15:55 never a shot like shots of Mars those
15:59 supposedly came back in the 70s the
16:02 Viking missions right I mean if NASA was
16:05 a software company
16:07 they would have handed in like a [ __ ]
16:09 pocket calculator in 1969 which would
16:13 have been truly a revolutionary piece of
16:15 software who actually did that in the
16:18 40s you know with calculus for the
16:19 military but then you know like 50 years
16:23 later they might add an exponential
16:28 button so you could multiply a number
16:30 times a number to find its true value I
16:32 mean they don't progress at all right
16:36 how long is this Space Shuttle been
16:39 exactly the same its whole [ __ ] life
16:41 right the only thing they did is change
16:42 the paint job swap out a few computers
16:44 you know it was a joke it never got
16:48 innovated every time I have to get off a
16:50 plane
16:51 I always think goddamn the lack of
16:53 innovation in airport design and you
16:58 know you get four doors on a fuselage
17:00 and we're all crawling out one who
17:02 really yeah some airports are smart
17:04 enough to open the back door but you get
17:06 four doors when I get all four of them
17:08 open let's all get the hell out of this
17:09 [ __ ] joint maybe move the doors maybe
17:11 make them a little bit bigger maybe you
17:13 pop open the top like the Space Shuttle
17:15 you know I don't know maybe it's like
17:17 subway doors you know yeah you're gonna
17:19 have to work on compression and with the
17:21 cabin and all that kind of stuff I
17:24 digress but someone had this idea of
17:29 let's try to go into space let's try to
17:31 put something in orbit an orbit was
17:34 really a mathematical theory up until
17:38 the fact up until the moment that we did
17:39 it you can throw something out so far
17:44 and then when it tries to fall back to
17:46 the planet it started on our star or
17:49 whatever it goes in a big circle
17:50 because what's strange about that is
17:53 that we don't nothing actually usually
17:55 starts that way like things don't get in
17:57 orbit around each other because you get
17:59 knocked off another thing and I know
18:01 there's a big theory about the moon
18:02 being the results of a earth killer you
18:07 know they just blew the whole place up I
18:09 don't buy that for a [ __ ] second
18:11 right look at the moon people does it
18:13 look like it's made of anything that's
18:14 on earth no so this theory that it came
18:19 from Earth is
18:20 absurd right when you start to realize
18:23 craters don't exist it'll get a little
18:25 bit further on your rate but what is the
18:28 magician's one of the huge fundamental
18:32 talents that a magician has to learn
18:35 misdirection and what is misdirection
18:39 well it's to create an out of sight out
18:42 of mind
18:43 situation where you are looking over
18:46 here and the dude is pocketing something
18:49 over here or getting something out
18:51 transitioning moving something around
18:53 that would reveal the trick or at least
18:55 give you a clue taken at a fundamental
18:59 value NASA is in the game of
19:02 misdirection look on your monitor look
19:07 at the fun CG pictures that we had
19:10 created months before this mission took
19:12 place there is no risk
19:15 they don't take risks right they don't
19:18 the public thinks that they're seeing
19:21 live-action footage I watched a YouTube
19:24 video last night where guy was recalling
19:25 an article reading it about this landing
19:27 of this new robot on Mars
19:30 and it actually said live-action footage
19:32 click here and it's showing the
19:36 animation the animation of this thing
19:39 shaped like a bullet that is flying
19:42 backwards it's unbelievable how [ __ ]
19:47 stupid that is that some cone shaped tip
19:51 is going to naturally travel with the
19:56 point up right how many times you fire a
19:59 gun and the bullet always travels with
20:01 the point moving forward it's a
20:03 mandatory thing it's it's you know its
20:06 laws of physics it's the friction
20:08 against the atmosphere what would it
20:11 take to make a bullet turn around and
20:12 put its ass first the whole way down I
20:14 think it would be impossible because
20:18 even if you could get the thing
20:19 projected in that direction maybe a
20:20 railgun could do it because throwing it
20:22 so quickly I still think that projectile
20:24 would turn around every single missile
20:26 you've ever seen every single piece of
20:28 ordnance you've ever seen has a pointy
20:30 tip and the pointy tip is the thing that
20:32 hits the target
20:33 it has to it's just the way it is right
20:35 and what's really goofy is it's the idea
20:39 okay
20:40 that you're going to enter orbit and
20:43 we're gonna kill the moon hoax one more
20:46 time here before but I'm putting some in
20:48 the and queue here if your toe reduce
20:56 friction such that you don't have a
20:58 perilous situation of massive heat that
21:02 you have to dissipate how do you make
21:05 cars hmm never seen cars designed with
21:08 the wind tunnels they are trying to cut
21:12 down on what oh it's a little f-word not
21:16 that one friction try to cut down a
21:18 friction so you want to have all of the
21:22 atmosphere get pierced at its most
21:24 optimal angle such that the air can move
21:28 around the shape as quickly as possible
21:31 to create less less friction again if
21:36 you've got a parachute then you're gonna
21:38 be able to slow down there's no problem
21:40 with that
21:41 that'll work like that does it they've
21:43 got it turned all around upside down
21:45 creating the worst situation that you
21:49 possibly could to bring the astronauts
21:51 came to the moon missions into the most
21:54 dangerous configuration it they always
21:59 talked about this exact angle right if
22:01 it's too steep it burns up if it's too
22:05 shallow it bounces off
22:06 well the [ __ ] thing is shaped like a
22:07 bullet and you let the nosecone go in
22:09 first right with the point I think all
22:12 that angle crap will calm down quite a
22:13 bit one you're not creating a massive
22:17 amount of friction which means you're
22:19 not creating the massive amount of heat
22:21 that is going to vaporize your units
22:24 Dave posted an absolutely brilliant I
22:27 got to go to look at the math on this
22:28 claim I'm gonna mention it in the next
22:30 moon mission one so pardon for the
22:32 advanced repeat but they say that you
22:36 know the Space Shuttle comes in around
22:38 16,000 miles an hour into the atmosphere
22:40 and has to have all these you know tiles
22:42 to endure the heat and then you have it
22:47 taking off
22:47 and this is the claim it's like 25,000
22:49 miles an hour to get out of Earth orbit
22:51 but it doesn't need any special
22:53 shielding to get out I mean it does have
22:55 tiles on it but they never talk about
22:56 you know fire coming over the nosecone
22:58 as its as its leaving and going into
23:01 orbit so I'm gonna go do the math on
23:03 that and make sure that's correct but I
23:05 thought that was a brilliant idea so let
23:10 me ask you this fundamental question
23:11 before we try to go any further than
23:13 just it's a way to steal money that's
23:15 the answer we're gonna put out there
23:17 it's a simple one is NASA faking space
23:25 we have all kinds of areas that we use
23:28 to answer that question the Apollo
23:31 missions we have the Space Shuttle we
23:36 have the ISS the International Space
23:40 Station then we have them mixed together
23:42 right we have China showing identical
23:48 Space Station shots as ours we know
23:52 they're really good at making facsimile
23:53 the things typically don't polish it as
23:56 much as we do which is why I think they
23:58 have some air bubble problems in their
24:00 shots
24:01 the Russians well they're with us and so
24:04 they're inside of our camp and again if
24:06 we hate that country so much which is
24:08 your left and right propaganda [ __ ]
24:10 but what the [ __ ] they doing on our
24:12 space Space Station right answer we
24:16 don't hate him we're all in the same
24:18 camp together and that's why they've
24:19 been invited and to share their
24:22 brilliance and their capabilities but
24:26 okay we haven't seen any stars in space
24:28 in any goddamn footage that's supposedly
24:31 live-action from NASA the only time we
24:34 ever see stars is when they are taking
24:37 these deep-space Sofia shots out of a
24:41 747 and saying it's coming from this
24:43 thing called the Hubble telescope they
24:46 come out of telescope arrays radar
24:50 arrays right but never with the human
24:53 being going hey mom how's it going that
24:56 never happens does it again I've never
25:00 seen ISS foot
25:01 where they take it and point it at the
25:03 moon take a camera and that that really
25:05 cool little pod that they like to sing
25:08 David Bowie songs in and pointed out the
25:11 window at the moon and just get a
25:12 crystal-clear [ __ ] shot of the moon
25:14 right
25:15 can you imagine you're completely
25:17 outside of the atmospheric distortion of
25:19 Earth which already looks pretty good
25:21 you know the nice zoom camera
25:22 I've taken some gorgeous shots of the
25:25 movie they don't do it
25:30 there's no aperture problems man if your
25:32 eyeballs can see it your cell phone can
25:34 see it done deal you can see the milky
25:36 way guarantee it if you're out there
25:38 they don't have any of that [ __ ] hmm and
25:42 what's interesting is is that they will
25:44 say stuff like you know we'll say stuff
25:46 to each other like how do they think
25:49 they can get away with this [ __ ] right
25:52 and because you know I go to smoke
25:54 lounges where we actually talk about all
25:56 this stuff like all the deep thoughts
25:58 stuff is my place and the answer I
26:05 always return them back to anybody who
26:07 gets to that point as I go well they are
26:08 getting away with that [ __ ]
26:09 they're totally getting away with it and
26:12 they have gotten away with it from the
26:14 very inception of NASA now what's
26:17 interesting is is that we know that
26:19 education and you know I harp about this
26:21 and I realize there's themes that I
26:23 repeat a lot it shows part of us because
26:25 I want to drive it into you to get you
26:27 to think you know but the education is
26:32 so bad now how's the kids supposed to
26:35 get an intellect to realize wait a
26:38 minute how does it make any sense when
26:40 you are raised with something a
26:42 particular way well you know when NASA
26:44 goes into space there's never any stars
26:45 because of the camera aperture and Mary
26:48 Mary it's all [ __ ] right but if
26:50 you're raised with that then you tend to
26:52 think that that's the norm right how
26:55 many of you have ever had a best friend
26:57 or maybe you're one of these people and
26:59 your family just has some weird [ __ ]
27:02 [ __ ] that they do right I don't mean to
27:05 cast aspersions you know do no harm as
27:07 long as you're in that camp I you know I
27:09 don't have any problems with your
27:11 families but you know you have that
27:13 friend and their families are really
27:14 weird
27:15 but they don't understand it's weird
27:17 because they've always had this weird
27:21 thing occur their entire lifetime I once
27:25 met a woman who's 60 years old friend of
27:27 a friend she came from an upper I think
27:31 upper upper class family so old money
27:32 maybe middle upper because she didn't
27:35 have billions or anything she had
27:37 married into a good family she came from
27:38 a family they came from overseas she was
27:40 first-generation American she's 60 years
27:42 old she told me that her family was a
27:45 nudist family lived in a really nice
27:47 house in upstate New York but she says
27:51 so we're just messing with their
27:54 computers like 20 years ago and she
27:57 looks at me and she goes you know and
27:59 and so I'm already kinda like okay
28:01 that's very interesting you know I've
28:02 heard some friends of mine I've heard of
28:04 friends of mine you have a nudist family
28:05 it's like they just go home and
28:06 everyone's naked like [ __ ] Ferengi's
28:08 or whatever and she goes oh yes my
28:12 father had the most glorious balls I was
28:16 like what you know it's just wow wow
28:22 that was a little too close for comfort
28:25 in my opinion okay that's how you can
28:28 that's that's the degree of which your
28:30 brain can get adapted to something
28:33 doesn't make any sense to everyone else
28:35 at least right but you do no harm I
28:38 guess you're all right
28:38 but NASA taking our money sixty million
28:40 dollars a day probably more now and
28:42 that's not GPS budget and all the other
28:45 ancillary companies if they can get away
28:50 with it and if they ever have gotten
28:51 away with it yeah how do you put stars
28:55 in the background of a set that's in a
28:58 box that's in water how do you do that
29:02 you see these training facilities and
29:05 quote-unquote right of these astronauts
29:08 testing their ISS you know maneuvers
29:13 here they are inside of a big tank and I
29:17 mean a big-ass tank of water
29:22 the astronauts don't put off any bubbles
29:27 because they're living off of tubes we
29:30 go back to a central system so if
29:32 there's any bubbles its way back there
29:35 like a fish tank somewhere scuba divers
29:38 now they're popping out bubbles like
29:40 crazy but how are these rooms configured
29:44 right in plain sight right got a whole
29:48 set of the ISS and then you have blue
29:51 screen everything that's not the ISS in
29:55 those rooms the walls the pipes the
29:58 floors the ceilings everything's blue
30:00 like like blue screen blue very specific
30:03 chroma key blue that you take out of
30:07 footage when you're editing it's a movie
30:10 set it's a complete [ __ ] movie set
30:12 it's not a training facility it's a
30:13 [ __ ] movie set if it's a training
30:16 facility then nothing would be pretty
30:18 nothing would be pristine
30:20 oh sure you're gonna have absolutely
30:21 dead that on you no duplicates of the
30:24 space station components because you
30:25 can't train on something that isn't
30:27 gonna have the right bolts and wires and
30:28 [ __ ] right but you don't need to spend
30:30 all the money to make the damn thing
30:32 blue people I recorded episode yesterday
30:37 but hasn't released I don't know why
30:40 it's gonna release but I mentioned the
30:42 fact that there are these you know
30:43 defected agents that after serving in
30:47 the top intelligence companies agencies
30:49 in the entire world will come out 20
30:51 years later with nothing to gain they're
30:52 not selling a book and they simply say
30:54 look you guys believe a completely false
30:57 reality like they don't they don't give
31:01 you a an exception to the rule well that
31:04 area is right in this area is wrong they
31:07 just say everything that you believe is
31:09 a complete magic trick it's a game it's
31:13 [ __ ] right I hope my graceful ones
31:18 like I hope you guys like the fact I
31:20 know one guy said hey you probably
31:22 shouldn't swear as much and I do I do
31:24 agree I study Kenneth Burke the
31:25 philosopher and he he made some really
31:30 good points about you becoming who you
31:32 who you portray yourself to be sort of
31:34 thing
31:35 and this is the way I am but isn't it
31:37 nice that I can just say what you're
31:39 feeling and you don't have to like I
31:42 watched lyonel nation brilliant guy he
31:45 gets up to the point where he just wants
31:47 to say [ __ ] and he doesn't do it Alex
31:50 Jones goes right up to the point where
31:52 he wants to see a dirty word and he
31:53 won't go over because he's worried about
31:55 some goddamn sponsor somewhere isn't it
31:58 nice to be real I mean you know that's
32:01 one reason why I was SM radio whatever
32:03 is serious radio you could finally hear
32:08 people talk the way that they actually
32:10 talk and make your make up your mind
32:11 whether or not you like him or not I was
32:15 a little bit careful for I think the
32:16 first 12 episodes and then I moved on I
32:21 came back to my true self I do apologize
32:25 for the closed mic work in season one
32:27 took me about half the season to figure
32:29 out I could actually keep this thing
32:30 away from my face but anyway back to the
32:33 subject at hand one of the interesting
32:37 themes that I hear when it comes to
32:40 global deception is a particular group
32:45 like the Jesuits I haven't really heard
32:48 this with the Jews I just haven't Jews
32:51 are all about money problems and also
32:52 their stuff and that's the accusation of
32:57 course if you think the Rothschilds are
33:00 Jewish you were lost let me tell you but
33:04 the Jesuits the Masons you know I'm not
33:10 really convinced because I haven't heard
33:13 any claims of any kind that your your
33:16 money changers which would be your I
33:18 guess your Rothschilds and your
33:19 hapsburgs and all the royal families you
33:22 know I've never really heard any
33:23 rationale for them trying to deceive us
33:25 from the shape of the planet right again
33:30 if there's a wall and a dome and they
33:32 know it and then the only thing that I
33:35 could remotely suggest this is full-on
33:40 conspiracy right I mean this is like way
33:43 outside the norm which doesn't mean it's
33:46 not true but you go to the wall
33:49 and you meet the caretakers there right
33:52 there and they're like all right you you
33:54 figured us out it's like it's like the
33:55 Truman Show right Jim Carrey's character
33:58 gets to the edge of his ocean wall and
34:01 it's this painting of sky and he finds a
34:05 staircase that goes into the wall and
34:08 he's gonna leave and man I think they
34:10 could have made a whole movie after that
34:11 about what happened afterwards you know
34:14 but they meet the dome owners and they
34:17 say well you're not supposed to find the
34:21 edge but congratulations that you did
34:23 find the edge why don't you come in for
34:25 some dinner we're gonna show you what
34:27 this thing really is and they go on the
34:30 other side and they look back and
34:31 they're like oh my god it's a big-ass
34:34 contact lens on the surface of oh maybe
34:38 a ball it's just a little patch on top
34:41 right and they say well that moon thing
34:45 it's it's an old Sun you know we put it
34:52 in here and getting it out as a little
34:54 tricky but supposedly by the way there
34:59 was some one of the listeners came in I
35:01 have to look this up very fascinating
35:03 they said I believe it was the Greeks
35:05 that they cited as saying that there was
35:09 an era before the moon I think that's
35:13 fascinating was in the in the history of
35:16 mankind in the history of celestial
35:18 bodies of any kind it would seem like
35:20 that's just yesterday a few thousand
35:23 years back but what a great little
35:26 premise of a story right so what is the
35:31 other theory of the Flat Earth this
35:33 thing right I'm gonna stick with that
35:35 because it's got more pizazz than just a
35:38 money laundering scheme well the other
35:42 theory is that it's not really a dome at
35:46 least right over the edge of the ice it
35:48 turns back into lush tropical weather
35:51 and it has more ocean on the other side
35:56 it gets warmer and that there are a
35:58 bunch of islands out there a bunch of
35:59 continents out there all right what is
36:01 it the guy that should
36:02 in the Japanese airport and had a map of
36:06 the earth it was flat but it had a bunch
36:08 of other far more land outside the disk
36:11 than we have inside this disk I don't
36:16 believe there was any claim that that
36:19 had a wall after all those continents
36:22 very interesting right what if and this
36:28 is what's a little puzzling to me with
36:30 the amount of technology that we have
36:31 today if they don't attempt to fake it
36:34 they don't attempt to fake stars at all
36:39 they've made these mistakes and you know
36:42 they could just simply say we've got a
36:43 better camera now this camera you know
36:46 it's a big mission it's gonna be great
36:48 to Falcon nine it goes up it turns on
36:51 the camera and all of a sudden their
36:53 space oh my god we finally stopped using
36:56 the the old Kodak 110 from 1979 now we
37:00 can see stars the fact that again we
37:03 can't see stars is the most highly
37:07 evident suspect smoking gun that all
37:10 this shit's faked no matter how much you
37:11 want to believe it's true it's fake but
37:15 now what if they met the dome owners and
37:19 the dome motors say well let's just say
37:23 they're not that empathetic they treat
37:24 us like rats in a cage and they simply
37:28 look at us whoever's the ambassador and
37:32 they say well here's the deal if this
37:37 [ __ ] catches on if you don't organize
37:42 very quickly into a treaty we'll say
37:46 it's 1954 and get everyone on board and
37:49 forbid human beings from figuring out
37:51 where the hell you guys are because
37:52 you're in our experiment you have heard
37:55 about cataclysmic floods well that's
37:59 what's going to happen we're gonna raise
38:01 the sea level most of you will die we
38:04 will take some choice individuals out
38:06 all of you guys of course and we'll
38:10 repopulate the world we're gonna drop
38:13 them off we're right at the tip
38:15 Egypt which is the center of a good
38:20 landmass keeping them nice and far away
38:22 from the border we're gonna obviously
38:27 get rid of all of the technology that
38:30 you guys have put together all the books
38:32 that you put together we're gonna
38:34 rethink the story of how you figure this
38:35 out and we're gonna try not to make the
38:40 mistake again very much like that Star
38:43 Trek episode where everyone was put to
38:45 sleep and data was the only one that
38:48 could get put to sleep because he was an
38:49 Android and he had to lie to everyone
38:53 when they woke up but he accidentally
38:55 forgot a few pieces of evidence in the
38:59 medical Bay and so when they redid the
39:03 scenario put everyone back to sleep and
39:05 reset everything they got all the
39:06 evidence perfect and they never went
39:09 back and found the planet that was
39:10 hiding in the universe now let's just
39:14 say that it is the financial thing okay
39:18 you know it's um trying to think here of
39:23 an analogy I got one for you some dude
39:30 is dating two chicks at the same time
39:32 could be a woman dating two guys at the
39:34 same time for a little while their life
39:39 is all arranged like you couldn't get
39:41 this thing started unless things were
39:43 serendipitously arranged where maybe one
39:45 dude works at night and one guy works
39:48 during the day and so the woman is able
39:49 to go back and forth or the guy is able
39:51 to go back and forth hiding two
39:54 relationships I mean this stuff happens
39:56 more often than you think people have
39:58 families two families right so guys our
40:00 secret polygamists right if anything
40:04 changes in the equation with these two
40:06 outer people the one person trying to
40:09 date the two are gonna run into they're
40:12 gonna run into a problem because if both
40:14 people get the day shift or both people
40:16 get the night shift or both people say
40:18 will you marry me I want to live
40:21 together then the Cabal falls apart it
40:24 explodes in your face so every single
40:27 day that trans transpires
40:29 you're on edge because you know this is
40:32 going to eventually blow up in your face
40:34 and believe me it will John McCain's
40:38 daughter in Los Angeles was discovered
40:41 right Bill Clinton's kid in Arkansas was
40:44 discovered it always it always fails
40:47 right now we could probably say in our
40:50 group the NASA has already been caught
40:52 they've been caught because they never
40:53 can produce a star in a shot even Elon
40:57 Musk can't produce a goddamn star when
40:58 he's trying to say his roadster was out
41:01 there floating in space there's the SS
41:05 well they've mastered the internal shots
41:07 but can they master the the moon showing
41:12 up and then you know as soon as they
41:13 film any of this nerds can pull up all
41:18 of the astronomy software and I mean
41:21 they will isolate it down to the
41:22 rotational craters that are visible they
41:26 will figure out exactly where they said
41:28 the ISS was they will simulate it in a
41:30 computer point the camera out the door
41:32 and find out if it's if it's really
41:33 accurate so in order for NASA to forge
41:37 the stars they would have to essentially
41:39 usurp and gain complete control over all
41:42 companies that make astronomers oft
41:44 where and sync it such that the shots
41:47 and the software will all pan out and
41:49 probably stage a bunch of nerds
41:51 confirming that it's true I think I'm
41:55 giving them too much information what do
41:56 you think I think the the audience that
42:02 goes rah-rah for NASA is starting to
42:04 shrink right starting to shrink big-time
42:08 it's starting to get to a point where
42:10 people are like you know it's just
42:12 really funny and this will further my
42:15 point here I've never seen more organic
42:19 comments online trying to you know Nast
42:23 of trying to Pat itself on the back or
42:25 someone trying to say hey look what NASA
42:28 just did and people coming and going no
42:31 they didn't it's all CG in the comment
42:37 section there's very few folks to come
42:39 in and defend NASA in terms of being
42:41 legit they might defend essence
42:43 well this is fake but this is good you
42:45 know I have I totally respect that what
42:49 would be the byproduct of lying about
42:51 space
42:53 what is the byproduct of lying about
42:55 space let's just take it from that angle
42:57 you have an eight-year-old son or
43:01 daughter and they are turning into a
43:04 space kid just like a lot of us I was
43:07 one of these kids you buy him astronaut
43:11 ice cream dehydrated ice cream you get
43:14 him every coffee table book poster
43:16 whatever movie and they believe that we
43:21 are doing these things they believe
43:22 we've been to the moon they believe that
43:24 in their lifetime they're gonna go to
43:25 Mars like they're physically personally
43:28 going to go to Mars it's gonna be just
43:30 like Total Recall 1988 what's happening
43:34 in that child hmm well they might go
43:39 into aerospace they might become a
43:43 mathematician a scientist of some form
43:46 scientist of mathematics maybe a
43:47 scientist of engineering but hmm let's
43:53 let's take it another step further what
43:57 is the eventualities for that kid in
43:59 real life so they're being inspired to
44:01 eight years old and they're gonna hang
44:02 on to it to 18 they're gonna go into
44:04 college and do at least four years
44:06 they're probably needed a masters or a
44:07 PhD in order to get a job at these
44:09 organizations so they're gonna stay in
44:11 school until they're 28 they will
44:13 definitely be academically smart right
44:16 like we did in our fake intelligence
44:19 episode will they ever become truly
44:21 intellectual and deduce anything hmm I
44:24 don't know
44:26 schools today do not promote in any way
44:29 shape or form intelligence sorry about
44:33 that we had a citizen of the United
44:36 States who cannot figure out how to open
44:39 their car door without setting off their
44:41 own alarm so if your kid stays smart but
44:45 not intelligent they probably will have
44:47 a much more successful in their mind
44:49 journey through these organizations of
44:51 NASA or JPL or anything related to that
44:53 and why is that well they can be
44:56 compartmentalize
44:57 like a mofo right compartmentalization
45:01 requires that you interview the employee
45:03 prior to hiring them
45:05 and again the pre censorship I'm going
45:08 to continue beating up that rod serling
45:11 talked about in his interview in 1959
45:13 but if you want to see that just look up
45:14 rod serling interview 1959 listen to the
45:17 whole thing it's about twenty minutes
45:18 then you will listen to one of the most
45:20 brilliant human beings in the world
45:22 speak but they make sure you can't think
45:26 for yourself and they make sure that you
45:28 swallow and have swallowed all official
45:30 stories to date if you want to work for
45:32 an alphabet agency you and you're going
45:35 to be in the ninety-eight percent fully
45:37 compartmentalized outside of the para
45:41 Meridian stone of the pyramid then you
45:44 are going to be very susceptible to all
45:48 suggestions and very patriotic towards
45:51 officials official stories and they will
45:53 reward you financially mentally
45:56 spiritually for being not that smart
46:00 okay now let's say your kid goes into
46:04 these organizations and we don't in the
46:06 next 10 20 years bust these
46:08 organizations up and reveal them for
46:09 what they are either because we can't
46:12 because there's a force pushing against
46:14 us that's stronger than we are or I
46:18 don't know they disappear or something
46:21 [ __ ] I don't know but your kid goes into
46:24 where these organizations and they're
46:25 like I am going to work on the Mars
46:27 mission it's what I want to do Buzz
46:30 Aldrin's estimate because he has such a
46:33 grasp of modern technology and rocketry
46:35 is 2040 we'll be on Mars as human beings
46:38 all right well that's good 22 years from
46:42 today so your kids eight you get there
46:45 in their 30s supposedly maybe it's not
46:47 them personally but they're gonna be
46:48 sitting behind a computer again fitting
46:50 them numbers or some fake [ __ ]
46:52 satellite or just some computer here on
46:54 earth simulating down to the perfect
46:57 delay the journey to Mars but maybe your
47:02 kid gets to die another 20 40 years
47:05 later probably 40 years later thinking
47:07 that they actually participated in a
47:09 mission to Mars
47:10 because the same scam that was run in
47:12 1969 he's run in 2040 or whenever it
47:14 occurs so in their mind they definitely
47:18 have the fat paycheck because they're
47:19 willing to go along with the scam you as
47:21 a parent didn't tell them that they are
47:25 wasting their lives right that's too
47:28 silly wasting but definitely not going
47:30 anywhere
47:33 none of us would do that right and so
47:37 you actually have created a scientific
47:40 child not necessarily intelligent but
47:44 smart memorizer and repeater and they
47:47 have the sense of satisfaction in their
47:48 whole life as a citizen of the United
47:51 States of America let's just say but in
47:54 the end the the wheels of progress spun
48:00 burned rubber and never took off never
48:03 one anywhere rain so the flip side to
48:06 the coin of this question is and because
48:10 it's when he's out of sight out of mind
48:11 games that we have to play is does NASA
48:17 or the United States of America or any
48:19 other country have a hidden space
48:21 program that accounts for all this
48:26 progress but somehow okay somehow
48:31 they're actually landing on the moon
48:33 actually go into all these places with
48:34 secret anti-gravity spaceships whatever
48:38 right I'm going to unequivocally say
48:41 hell no they don't have any of that [ __ ]
48:43 and the reason why is that they would
48:47 they would not continue risking the ISS
48:52 up there being incapable of taking a
48:54 picture of space without any stars
48:56 without any Milky Way without serious
48:59 without the moon they would eventually
49:03 just blame it on a camera get the
49:06 structure up there and film it now a lot
49:09 of you have done your due diligence on
49:12 the space station itself and the fact
49:14 that it is not buy a lot of structural
49:18 engineers capable of being up there with
49:22 people in it
49:23 because any reverberation in a
49:26 transverse wave of energy if someone
49:29 were to fall down for instance and one
49:31 of the capsules which again it's it's
49:33 weightlessness but you know they could
49:35 bump up against it they're flying too
49:36 fast in some zero-gravity situation and
49:39 they slam against the wall that forced
49:42 from their body slamming into the fabric
49:44 of the space station would then
49:46 reverberate down in an s-curve a
49:48 transverse wave which would then amplify
49:51 as it goes down and potentially whip out
49:54 one of the components on the other side
49:58 I'm not a structural engineer I don't
50:00 know if that's truly the situation but
50:02 I've seen more than one video online
50:04 from people with credentials that easily
50:08 say this is not possible one of the
50:10 other big things about the ISS that I
50:13 think I forgot to mention in one of my
50:15 episodes maybe I didn't but deed the
50:17 whole idea that no one ever filmed the
50:19 creation of this space station well what
50:24 does man always about man is always
50:25 about archiving accomplishments like
50:30 this right there's a new show that it's
50:33 not technically new and they've got tons
50:36 of videos I can't remember the name but
50:38 it's probably good I don't remember the
50:39 name that way I don't get any like I
50:41 don't know specific strikes or butthurt
50:46 from their community these two dudes one
50:50 seems to be fairly mega geeky and the
50:53 other one's sort of kind of geeky and
50:55 they're doing these fun videos these fun
50:58 videos about all kinds of things very
51:00 similar to deep thoughts in terms of
51:02 topics that are the more lighthearted
51:04 topics they're going for numbers they're
51:07 going for the demographic nothing wrong
51:09 with that but they covered the moon
51:12 missions and they have uncovered a brand
51:19 new twist on the moon missions Brandon
51:21 you have never heard this before and it
51:23 is the new thing that you guys need to
51:25 be aware of and I think it feeds into
51:29 keeping this facade that is fake space
51:32 and greens or blue screen you know water
51:36 tanks
51:36 essentially the ISS composite footage
51:41 right again gravity the movie showed up
51:44 out of thin air and I will tell you my
51:47 colleagues here in Los Angeles who have
51:50 all the gold statues you could possibly
51:52 imagine so that they were pulled into
51:53 the break room of their respective
51:56 companies and shown gravity like
52:00 trailers of it and these dudes jaws were
52:03 totally on the ground I guess it was a
52:05 company in Germany that did most of the
52:07 special effects and they just couldn't
52:09 believe the quality of the the swapping
52:13 of the hands and the face to create all
52:15 these amazing shots of the ISS being
52:17 ripped to shreds right you can assume
52:22 that the covert agencies are ten times
52:26 beyond that in terms of rendering
52:28 quality and that sort of thing right but
52:31 these gentlemen touched on this guy that
52:34 died at 94 he just wrote a book and he's
52:36 selling a [ __ ] book okay but what
52:40 they said was because they want to leak
52:42 some of the truth out but they want to
52:45 bend it at the end so that they can keep
52:48 the scam going for even longer so
52:51 they're willing to admit the stanley
52:53 kubrick participated at least in Apollo
52:55 11 we think he also per his confession
52:59 video which they did not touch with a
53:01 ten-foot pole which is very interesting
53:04 they said that they hired Stanley
53:06 Kubrick and they said the you know he
53:10 refused the first time and then was
53:13 probably threatened for the second go
53:16 according to Stanley in the confession
53:19 video there was no problem he was on
53:22 board it was a challenge of all
53:25 challenges just on 2001 a Space Odyssey
53:27 that developed all the special effects
53:29 that they were going to need it was not
53:31 a chance experience that that movie was
53:34 greenlit with no finished script for
53:36 fifteen million dollars one of the
53:37 highest budgets in the history of film
53:39 at that time only a couple movies I
53:42 think we're higher than that at the time
53:43 yeah go get a movie greenlit without a
53:47 finished
53:48 script go try to do that but they said
53:52 that Stanley did make every single every
53:55 single piece of fake footage that we saw
53:59 on all the Apollo missions all seven and
54:03 I mean you know once you look at this
54:05 Paula footage nowadays it is such a clay
54:07 model of of the moon surface it's
54:11 utterly laughable like you can literally
54:13 see the lack of detail and the craters
54:15 and stuff with Slash volcanic bubbles
54:19 but they had this all prepared just in
54:22 case they failed and when they got to
54:25 the moon
54:26 they said that buzz aw not not Buzz
54:28 Aldrin Neil Armstrong came down off the
54:30 staircase and either before or after his
54:35 famous phrase but you know one giant
54:38 step for mankind
54:40 he says supposedly okay and this is
54:43 what's funny they always they always
54:45 kind of frame the comment well then he
54:48 said but it was never televised okay
54:50 that there were a bunch of spacecraft
54:53 already there and that they were all
54:55 enormous on the edge of a crater lip
54:58 right and this this old guy he was
55:02 selling this book I don't I can't
55:04 remember his name off and I'm gonna
55:05 probably grab his name for my next moon
55:07 episode that's specifically devoted to
55:09 the moon he he said he saw the
55:13 photographs that they took that that
55:17 they were met by the aliens just on the
55:21 surface of the Moon just do how you
55:24 doing man you know you got to get the
55:26 [ __ ] out of here because this is our
55:27 place and you know you're not allowed to
55:29 be here don't come back right get your
55:33 moon rocks and get out of here it's kind
55:34 of what tapered old I guess but then
55:37 this old man and this is what's just a
55:39 classic classic sign of a desperate dude
55:44 he drew pictures
55:46 he drew hand drawings of the photographs
55:48 that supposedly he saw okay old guy this
55:53 is great this is great if you had to sit
55:56 you're let's say you just had an average
55:59 relative right there not a size
56:01 i person they're not a movie designer so
56:03 they I don't know how many native skills
56:04 in this area right you see this all the
56:07 time with UFO stories from families that
56:10 are obviously faking the crap out of
56:12 their story just to get some money
56:13 because you're selling something right
56:16 the guy draws a series of like half a
56:20 dozen identical ships on the edge of a
56:23 crater they are essentially super low
56:28 polygon pillboxes sort of like um like a
56:33 casket looking poly thing into this guy
56:36 that was futuristic did you see how I
56:40 drew it in Pawleys you don't have this
56:42 theory about how ships could be polygons
56:44 and it looked juvenile as juvenile could
56:48 get the last [ __ ] thing you would
56:51 probably ever make a ship that look like
56:53 if you were an alien but to him that was
56:56 huge right this whole thing about the
56:59 Roswell crash and you know you'll hear
57:01 this military story that they they
57:04 knocked it out of the sky with radar
57:06 well wise pick radar right radars just
57:10 electromagnetic waves and you know if
57:12 you want to fly through the universe or
57:13 do any interdimensional travel I'm sure
57:16 the wear and tear from natural universe
57:18 forces is way beyond any man-made radar
57:21 right dr. Steven Greer reignited the
57:24 theory of the radar story and said that
57:27 that they had much more powerful radars
57:29 backed and then we'd used today and
57:31 that's how they shot the ship out of the
57:34 sky that had those three aliens in it
57:36 okay so the story is a forgery but what
57:40 they said was once they realized that
57:42 there was a they were aliens on the
57:43 surface of the Moon they switched to all
57:46 this fake footage now again if the three
57:49 astronauts died in the mission because
57:51 it goes really really bad faking that
57:54 they're on the moon doesn't make any
57:56 goddamn sense because what's gonna
57:57 happen when they fall out of the sky and
57:59 this capsule with the parachute on it
58:01 and they're not in there or their dead
58:03 bodies or they can't be in there because
58:04 they're on the moon and they're dead
58:06 because they crash this horrible excuse
58:09 for a spaceship called a the lunar
58:11 lander
58:12 right we're going to tear that a new one
58:15 next episode it doesn't work there's no
58:19 press conference the the fathers of
58:21 three families don't come home so it's a
58:24 failure on the first mission and you
58:26 think there's gonna be a second third
58:27 fourth mission hell no they didn't take
58:30 any chances these people were gonna come
58:32 home regardless which is why they could
58:35 continue milk in the ship once you
58:36 realize the benefit to those who were on
58:39 the take and you know hey if we're all
58:41 doing a big role-playing exercise if the
58:44 moon missions are just nothing but a big
58:46 LARP then you in the end logistically
58:51 wouldn't allow even if someone walked in
58:53 the room say Apollo 15 they'd go hey man
58:55 we think we have it we think we have the
58:57 technology to actually get to the moon
58:59 oh really
59:02 yeah we got this boost room and got this
59:04 antigravity thing we just finally
59:06 polished off I think it's gonna be a
59:07 cinch to go there you think NASA would
59:10 say oh well then I guess we won't
59:12 continue faking it on a movie set we're
59:15 actually gonna risk everyone's lives
59:17 we're gonna take this sweet thing that
59:20 we have that makes money and we're gonna
59:22 potentially lose all that cash I don't
59:25 think so
59:25 they wanted a surefire thing so you
59:29 asked me why they faked it why they
59:31 faked it today well they have no
59:33 technical means that they're willing to
59:35 risk at least to forge the stars and all
59:38 the shots it's too much effort right
59:41 was it the the ISS supposedly goes
59:45 around the earth every 90 minutes and
59:46 has the sunset or a sunrise every 45
59:49 minutes okay well everyone right now the
59:55 majority I don't know what the numbers
59:57 are but the majority of mankind believes
59:59 that we are there up in space listener
60:02 just said well I saw the ISS go by right
60:06 I got friends who said they saw it go by
60:08 and then I heard how fast it goes by and
60:13 my buddy okay this is what's wild he
60:18 told a story this guy's a big visual
60:20 visual effects legend right he tells me
60:24 and a bunch of other people he was on a
60:26 rooftop with a bunch of his buddies and
60:28 they had a camera point
60:29 their exact place with ISS was gonna go
60:31 by and that he looked through the
60:33 telescope and saw it and eventually I
60:37 said hey buddy you know we didn't go the
60:40 moon right yes he doesn't believe we
60:41 didn't go them good do you realize you
60:44 can't look through a telescope and see
60:47 the ISS just up there hovering it's not
60:50 geocentric orbit it is doing what we
60:52 call hauling ass right the amount of
60:56 frames that you're able to take in an
60:58 average camera running at 29 frames a
61:00 second I think you're able to get maybe
61:03 three frames of it going over the moon
61:07 surface maybe so the only thing they
61:10 could have done was taking a camera put
61:12 it on a telescope have it blasting the
61:15 frames and then slow you know go back
61:18 after its passed over roll back the
61:20 footage on a monitor on the roof and say
61:22 there guys you see that thing right
61:24 there
61:24 isn't that the shape of the ISS yeah
61:27 okay well then you saw the ISS you can't
61:30 just look up and see it now you can see
61:33 really shiny dots going around the earth
61:37 I've seen these as kids as a kid you
61:40 know satellites supposedly going around
61:42 the earth right now someone just
61:44 realized and mentioned in the comments I
61:46 think quite fairly that if we have a
61:49 planet that's being visited by UFOs on a
61:51 constant basis kind of the bill Cooper
61:54 model of the abyss where they're living
61:57 on the bottom of the ocean they're
61:58 visiting us and devils tower or whatever
62:01 that then entering the atmosphere would
62:05 make potentially a streak and they're
62:09 landing or or taking off and they're
62:12 going the other direction I thought it
62:14 was interesting that I think it's very
62:17 interesting that they can predict meteor
62:19 showers
62:20 that here we are hurling through the
62:25 universe as a part of a supposed greater
62:29 construct called the galaxy and they
62:32 know of these clouds of meteors that on
62:36 cyclical waves coming by Earth's
62:39 atmosphere and that we can go out and
62:41 look
62:42 now I've done this probably half a dozen
62:46 times in my own lifetime before I was
62:49 probably 20 years old but there's some
62:52 times I've done it in my 20s I think I
62:54 don't think I've done it my 30s but you
62:57 hear about meteor showers and you go
62:58 outside and you look and sure enough
62:59 it's usually very low volume meteors you
63:03 might see like two or three really good
63:05 ones if you've seen more than you've had
63:07 a better experience than I have but I've
63:09 even been in Kansas with almost no light
63:12 pollution sitting on a trampoline
63:13 looking straight up and didn't see any
63:15 major you know flurries in the sky but
63:20 what if meteor showers are nothing more
63:21 than the scheduled appearance of our
63:24 brothers in space or the dump owners or
63:27 whatever like yeah yeah yeah tell your
63:29 people that you're gonna have a that
63:31 there's a meteor shower because we're
63:34 gonna bring in you know 25 of our dudes
63:37 and we'll stagger their entry so that
63:40 doesn't look organized and you know and
63:43 then we're gonna leave on this day so
63:45 you might want to say that another one's
63:47 coming by on that particular time and
63:49 that way it's all covered well I saw a
63:51 meteorite but you see meteorites all the
63:54 time without any scheduled appearances
63:56 right again there's in my lifetime okay
64:01 I don't know how many big meteorites
64:03 I've seen I've probably seen a good
64:06 half-dozen massive falling stars I mean
64:11 big furry fireworks coming into the
64:14 atmosphere and it wasn't a space station
64:16 and it wasn't a space shuttle exploding
64:17 or whatever but they are always going
64:21 from top to bottom right never up from
64:26 the horizon a little off-topic but I
64:30 think that that's very important when
64:33 you think about the answer to the
64:36 question of why do they fake space man I
64:41 look up I see stars
64:42 yeah we're calling them stars we have
64:45 people that film them with cameras and
64:47 again they're very bizarre-looking it
64:51 has been proven to not be anomalies of
64:54 the atmosphere and it is Prue
64:56 not to be an anomaly inside the camera
64:58 as I've said in the past once the
65:00 cameras moved and shaken any anomalies
65:04 that are a part of the light that you're
65:06 getting should also wiggle as well
65:08 because when the atmosphere is gonna is
65:10 going to shake no matter what it's sort
65:13 of like looking at the bottom of a pool
65:14 during the daytime all the refraction is
65:17 constantly moving right but when you see
65:19 a mohawk again on a star and then you
65:22 move the camera you know the atmosphere
65:24 is out of your control and the mohawk
65:27 doesn't change then you have to assume
65:29 the mohawk is really there somehow but
65:33 now let me and closing get it close to
65:36 the closing here let's run a scenario
65:39 let's run a scenario you you create a
65:43 YouTube channel like this and you focus
65:45 exclusively on the fraudulent space
65:48 agencies of the world and let's say you
65:49 get millions and millions of subscribers
65:51 and you are the one that is starting to
65:55 crack this thing open everyone's paying
65:57 attention to you you don't make any
65:59 mistakes in your videos so your
66:00 credibility is super-high and so some
66:05 black suits come and visit you at your
66:06 house and they've got a car and they say
66:11 well we need you to come with us don't
66:13 worry you're gonna be just fine you'll
66:15 be home tonight and your bed and you'll
66:17 live a nice long life but we need to
66:18 talk to you because you're obviously
66:20 touching on subjects that are very near
66:22 and dear to our employers hearts and so
66:26 you go off with these folks and they
66:27 take you to some NASA facility and they
66:31 sit you down in a beautiful boardroom
66:34 providing you all the amenities that you
66:36 need to feel comfortable and they sit
66:39 across the table from you and they they
66:41 complement your intellect they say well
66:43 you know it's very we're very impressed
66:45 with your with your whole portfolio of
66:48 videos your thought process is very
66:51 sound and you know what you got us we
66:55 know you didn't think of everything but
66:56 you aggregated it better than most and
66:59 they say okay here's the deal you're
67:04 right
67:05 we haven't been to the moon we're not on
67:07 Mars there's no Space Station we have
67:13 things that we put up in low atmosphere
67:17 that you might call satellites but even
67:20 those don't perform the way that we say
67:22 they do but here's the thing we've done
67:26 you know we inherited the guys talking
67:29 to you other girls talking to you say
67:30 look we didn't invent this whole problem
67:32 we inherited it but we've done the math
67:35 on it in terms of its benefits its pros
67:38 and cons to society and they say it's
67:43 overwhelmingly more positive than it is
67:46 negative and so we've had several
67:49 meetings over several decades since this
67:51 agency has existed about 60 years and
67:55 we've decided that all of us unanimously
68:01 decided we regret that we're not doing
68:03 what we say we do we do feel the pain
68:06 that you feel and we are desperately
68:08 trying to get there but in the meantime
68:11 we realize that to announce to the
68:15 people of the world that NASA is all
68:16 [ __ ] JPL is all [ __ ] we'll stunt
68:20 the growth of all space programs for
68:22 potentially a hundred years because no
68:25 one's gonna fund it anymore because no
68:27 one can trust it anymore
68:28 we've tried models of transparency but
68:31 they they fall apart very quickly so
68:37 we're inviting you inside of our circle
68:40 we've got some paperwork you need to
68:41 sign to shut you up
68:43 in fact you know we can take your
68:45 YouTube channel off the sci-fi we're
68:48 gonna change your theme a little bit
68:50 there's a big bonus in it if you're
68:54 willing to say to your listeners you
68:56 were skeptical but you thought about it
69:00 we've got a whole script for you to read
69:02 a whole theory of science of how you got
69:05 from not believing that it's real to
69:06 believing it's real
69:07 we're actually going to arrange a
69:09 mission for you to go to the ISS the
69:13 stage where we film this and you will be
69:16 a part of history
69:19 because we are now getting kids into
69:21 science more which were not of course
69:24 we're inventing technology that didn't
69:26 exist before which eventually will
69:28 become the science that most likely will
69:31 lead to the next stage of science which
69:33 will actually get us into space safely
69:35 we are secretly keeping the Orion
69:38 project going we have a lot of amazing
69:40 data coming in and now we have some
69:42 theories about how we could protect man
69:44 inside the the very vulnerable Van Allen
69:47 belts the invisible plasma currents
69:52 going in space when we do figure out how
69:56 to get to the moon you'll be right there
69:58 you'll be the next science guy
70:01 you'll be the Neil neck Neil deGrasse
70:02 Tyson what would you do what would you
70:07 do if they validated you told you that
70:11 it's true they said look but the world
70:15 is round
70:16 we have flown up and seen it and it
70:19 we've flown completely around it and
70:20 here's a videotape by the way of of us
70:24 going around and going over the South
70:26 Pole you can watch this we flew over it
70:29 in five different angles so you can see
70:30 it consider all day long promise it's
70:33 not a CG because the guy sitting in the
70:34 plane waving at you and by the way will
70:38 take you over the Antarctica so you know
70:40 that we're not lying
70:42 it's round sorry what do you do
70:48 consequently the channel that's out
70:50 there that peddled this awful cover
70:54 story which by the way ended with the
70:56 episode with the two guys go and are
70:59 very funny it's a very upbeat funny well
71:01 produced show I mean it's actually got
71:02 what looks to me like a full production
71:05 team behind it but maybe there are some
71:08 talented guys maybe one of the two geeks
71:10 is phenomenal at lighting a studio and
71:14 putting all the composite footage
71:16 together and writing the scripts and
71:17 getting it all perfect and just banging
71:19 these babies out and obviously being
71:21 able to fly around the world and do all
71:23 these interviews on the ground I mean it
71:24 seems like a complete chilly [ __ ]
71:27 show with big ass paychecks but they
71:30 asked each other
71:32 because they're asking the question the
71:34 episodes based on the question did we
71:35 grow the moon and so the very last thing
71:37 they say is did we go to the moon yes we
71:40 did and then they're automatically
71:43 peddling them the aliens story you know
71:47 it's like Christ getting to the moon is
71:49 an outrageous claim to begin with but to
71:51 beat the outrageous claim that can't be
71:53 proved that has been proven to be false
71:54 by claiming a more outrageous ridiculous
71:57 story over over that it should make you
71:59 laugh it should make you laugh really
72:06 please I don't think anyone is thumbing
72:11 their nose and the face of God I don't
72:15 think anyone has the balls to do that
72:16 not an alien not a human so if this is
72:21 the Flat Earth and anybody knows it
72:24 within these organizations they did not
72:27 find God and a firmament dome they
72:29 didn't because that's one thing I don't
72:33 think you could get you might get one
72:35 psychopath who's like yeah screw God I'm
72:38 a Satanist and papapapa no devil
72:40 somewhere we've got dig deeper into this
72:43 you know the soil of the earth and he'll
72:46 find Beelzebub mm-hm so the only Flat
72:50 Earth disc conspiracy that I would
72:54 subscribe to would be the other two
72:58 which is that they found the aliens that
73:01 owned the place and they had a
73:02 conversation wasn't it Colonel bird or
73:06 whatever the flew down there and said he
73:07 saw a lush world after you flew over the
73:10 edge of the Antarctic super cold area
73:15 right the other theory is that it's just
73:19 a barrier and then beyond that is
73:20 another ocean with a bunch of other
73:22 civilizations out there on continents
73:25 and for whatever reason that one doesn't
73:29 make any sense to me because this would
73:31 be a very intentional construct right I
73:34 mean they're trying to keep us in here
73:36 and so to have a bunch of other
73:38 continents outside of it those would
73:40 have to be the owners
73:43 and no one's to my knowledge ever answer
73:45 what's beyond those continents right is
73:46 the dome out there whatever and this
73:52 question came up - which is that at my
73:55 smoke lounge which is do you think that
73:59 we've ever launched a vehicle up far
74:02 enough if you believe in a dome theory
74:04 that it goes up and smacks the dome and
74:07 I think if you do some basic due
74:09 diligence and mathematics on the the
74:12 disks at 60,000 miles around or bigger
74:14 and then you do a 180 arc you know from
74:17 say zero degree to 180 with ninety being
74:20 directly in the center you have a dome
74:24 that is way higher than any of our
74:27 rocketry has ever been the best you
74:29 could do is fly it try to fly it over
74:31 the South Pole and then it bangs into
74:33 the wall that would be the best you
74:34 could do but here's what I think is sad
74:37 I think it's sad that when I see a
74:42 comment or someone says dude space
74:46 doesn't exist and therefore gravity
74:49 doesn't exist it's all [ __ ] it's air
74:53 pressure air pressure air pressure and
74:55 again when we vacuum out cubes and put
75:00 objects in there they fall to the earth
75:04 inside these inside these things and I
75:08 think we did it in high school too but
75:10 you can take a jar and suck all the air
75:12 out so there's no more pressure in there
75:14 and according to these folks that think
75:16 it's air pressure than the feather in
75:17 there or the anything in there it's
75:19 gonna start floating in the center
75:20 because there's no air pressure right
75:22 it's gonna be zero gravity all of a
75:23 sudden it's not the way it works try it
75:27 I don't know about you but I think that
75:32 there's a lot of technical innovations
75:34 that lie on the other side of us getting
75:38 out of the mass pulling against mass
75:40 mass pulling theory of gravity which
75:44 again is a phenomenon because it doesn't
75:46 [ __ ] work - the mass being pushed on
75:53 by its fundamental particle which is
75:56 ether of which you know has no positive
75:58 and negative charge it is merely a
76:00 particle that it's caught inside its own
76:04 turbulence it spins and
76:06 three-dimensional spheres again I've
76:10 said this in a comment but let me bring
76:12 this into the this particular episode I
76:16 think I touched on this mildly in one
76:19 episode but I did my gravity episode
76:21 before I figured out this perfect
76:22 analogy for gravity for everyone to
76:24 understand gravity and I always thought
76:26 my 10-year project for the unified
76:29 theory which is to describe ether I
76:32 started to describe gravity without
76:34 knowing about ether and now makes
76:37 complete sense which is a bubble
76:40 floating in water right it's perfect how
76:47 does a bubble hold itself together well
76:51 it's being pushed on by water on the
76:53 outside that's how it exists there's no
76:56 pull there's only a push well that's
76:59 exactly how everything gets created in
77:01 the universe okay
77:04 the water is moving constantly right
77:09 that's ether time to think about it I
77:13 think the episode yesterday talked about
77:16 the exact same thing you see gravity
77:20 every day you see it you feel it it's
77:23 not a goddamn myth you may want to call
77:25 what they have said gravity is is a myth
77:28 and it doesn't exist sure fine a bad
77:30 theory was a bunch of [ __ ] so it
77:33 doesn't exist I'm with you
77:35 but I am being held to this earth right
77:38 now by gravity that's what we're gonna
77:41 call it you want to want to think up a
77:42 new name the glue it's not air pressure
77:47 people why do they fake space well I
77:52 think because it's big money I think
77:56 because it's huge money to go any
77:58 further in the answer we have to reach
78:00 out to those other conspiracies which
78:03 are absolutely outrageous it's not that
78:06 they're not true but right now they're
78:07 just outrageous claims
78:09 that's fine most theories of all things
78:12 seem outrageous until proven I think we
78:16 have a soul well from some perspectives
78:19 that's a very outrageous claim I think
78:22 there's plenty of evidence little kids
78:24 that are SuperDuper old you could just
78:27 see it in their system then you have
78:30 adults that seem to be dumb as a bag of
78:32 [ __ ] hammers right no matter how old
78:35 their mortal coil gets they're just
78:37 absolute [ __ ] morons right they have
78:41 a very brand-new soul maybe they were an
78:44 insect before but I I could I could say
78:48 that there's more brilliance in half of
78:50 the jumping spiders in my house than
78:52 some of the morons I see in the real
78:53 world right none of my personal circles
78:58 but holding protest signs against the
79:01 current administration I think that's a
79:02 good group of them right there I think
79:06 you feel me that was a great question
79:08 thank you commenter for putting this in
79:13 my head if you haven't been to deep
79:15 thoughts radio.com please go if you're

79:41 which most human beings do you can come
79:43 into our Locke Facebook group a great
79:45 group of people super funny stuff all
79:48 day long and again you don't have to
79:50 believe in Flat Earth or any of that
79:51 crap but man some of those means that
79:53 are memes that are put up there are just
79:54 priceless we have a lot of memes that
79:58 pick apart science like something I've
80:01 mentioned in this episode for the very
80:05 few of you that feel like you'd like to
80:07 contribute monetarily to the show
80:10 there's a patreon page up there it's
80:12 pretty good service we have eight
