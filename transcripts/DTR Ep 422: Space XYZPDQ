00:29 good evening ladies and gentlemen good
00:32 afternoon
00:33 perhaps good morning today I thought
00:37 we'd have a little bit of fun reviewing
00:41 some of the I don't know what to call it
00:44 it seems like lunacy seems like utter
00:48 craziness but it it's also seems kind of
00:51 fun I'll call this one space XYZ PDQ and
01:00 that'll be the term that we use from
01:03 this point for to describe all the
01:05 ridiculous agencies that deal with false
01:09 claims of scientific space exploration
01:13 and accomplishment
01:15 now before we really dive in deep I will
01:19 say that well I went to space X's
01:22 website today and wow what a bunch of CG
01:26 in Hollywood that frickin website is you
01:30 know it's Elon Musk's predictions of
01:35 what his company is going to be able to
01:37 do an extremely near future are so
01:41 utterly outrageous and ridiculous
01:45 unless unless you know like the elite of
01:48 the world have decided to uncover all
01:52 hidden technology and give it to that
01:54 guy to then get it done through SpaceX
01:57 if that has happened then it all makes
01:59 sense but have you ever thought you know
02:04 I don't put this if they were going to
02:08 end the world which again I just read an
02:11 article yesterday Geoff Japan I guess is
02:13 gonna pass on 5g because of the harm
02:17 it's gonna do to the human body
02:19 everywhere else is rolling it out as
02:21 fast as possible
02:22 again variable very reliable sources on
02:27 Mayans say it is the extermination event
02:31 let's say you're Elon Musk and you're
02:33 aware of these things it's not his fault
02:36 but he gets you know he
02:38 little whispers here in there and
02:39 they're like yeah you know this 5g thing
02:41 we're gonna exterminate you know we're
02:44 gonna set it all up really do anything
02:46 with it then we're gonna spike it one
02:48 night and 80% of the world's gonna die
02:52 and then we've got this big you know PR
02:55 campaign excuse campaign the remaining
02:57 citizens we were gonna be in FEMA camps
02:59 anyway and so you know what dude he's
03:05 like when's that gonna happen now it's
03:06 like 2020 ish right okay so I can say
03:12 anything about what's gonna happen after
03:13 that point cuz it's not going to exist
03:15 you had to totally have fun all right do
03:18 because if that's the case I'm gonna
03:19 build me a Buck Rogers 1935 chrome
03:23 rocket that looks like a big joke it
03:28 literally looks like that it was a trip
03:30 to the moon episode back from 1902 which
03:37 I consistently referred to incorrectly
03:39 in my last episodes in 1908 episode I
03:42 watched at my smoke lounge about a month
03:45 ago the press conference he gave outside
03:50 of his warehouse in the middle of
03:52 California with the giant chrome ship in
03:55 the background and just watched all
03:58 these nerds worship him to go up to him
04:02 and and just live in fiction it was
04:05 almost like going to a cosplay LARP II
04:08 role-playing thing except unlike the
04:12 kids who admit their role-playing these
04:16 sort of I don't know brown-nosing
04:20 disciples of Elon Musk who who might
04:24 actually be the worst presenter in real
04:28 life that has ever been given camera
04:30 time back guy stutters and there's a
04:36 nice guy I'm sure he's a nice guy but
04:37 man if I was the board of directors I'd
04:39 be like okay you have to step down from
04:42 trying to present anything or you need
04:44 to go get your game together because if
04:45 this was the free throw somehow you're
04:48 throwing the ball attempting to throw
04:50 the ball at the basket but it's going
04:52 behind you in hitting an elderly woman
04:54 in the face we're apt to say you know
04:57 every single time adversity and Elon
04:58 Musk talk he seems like he's you know
05:01 aside from not being able to complete
05:02 his sins without renegotiating at five
05:04 times before he ends it seems like a
05:07 really sweet guy the stuff that the
05:10 company espouses is phenomenal the
05:15 Falcon the Falcon nine the dragon the
05:17 starship the Tesla you know company that
05:25 he created for the car the cars
05:28 definitely super cool the SUV probably
05:30 being the coolest thing I'm personally
05:32 really tired of seeing in the car
05:34 because in Orange County they've had him
05:35 from day one and they just don't update
05:39 enough for me personally but you know
05:41 whatever its progress his ideas for you
05:46 know shingles on houses that are solar
05:48 panels brilliant creating a really cool
05:52 battery company brilliant the word on
05:55 the street is that the battery design
05:58 that he used to start the company and
06:01 raise the money and build the machines
06:02 is obsolete already before he even sold
06:06 a single battery but a friend of mine
06:09 said that they're already changing it to
06:12 a really like that what is it the I was
06:17 a 100 year battery I think that's what
06:18 they're saying and it doesn't mean it
06:20 lasts for a hundred years it just means
06:22 it won't die for a hundred years so it
06:26 seems like Elon Musk as an individual is
06:30 involved with a lot of cool things I
06:32 think that again he's definitely part of
06:36 the Cabal because he's part of the big
06:38 the big money again he's also come out
06:41 and reaffirmed that he saw some AI that
06:43 he's terrified of and it's like okay
06:46 dude you're not willing to say what you
06:49 saw so shut the [ __ ] up I mean seriously
06:54 well you know 5g how about that how
06:58 about the fact that they turn it on and
07:00 all the birds die in a in a in a tree
07:03 you know they tell the guys install this
07:06 stuff you have to be ten feet away from
07:08 the 5g antenna otherwise you could you
07:11 could be immediately electrocuted EMP
07:15 din your brain
07:15 not really electrocuted but it'll fry
07:17 your brain kill you oh great
07:21 it sounds so safe doesn't it the by the
07:25 way the sky today is fully controlled I
07:29 ate lunch today and just sat there and
07:31 watched him just dive over the
07:33 restaurant and of course a few minutes
07:36 later about 15 minutes later whatever
07:38 they drawn in the sky looks like a cloud
07:41 to the uneducated so is SpaceX doing
07:48 anything legit I'd say yeah I mean you
07:52 know Falcons Falcon 9's
07:54 they launch they launch out of our sight
07:56 now whether or not the Boosters ever
07:57 really truly land backwards and all that
07:59 crap
08:00 totally not convinced so ya no
08:02 pedestrians been invited to see that
08:03 event occur and the first year they were
08:07 trying to pawn that crap off on us you
08:10 know every special effect guy in the Los
08:12 Angeles was like oh my god that's fake
08:15 you know you could see the cranes
08:16 dropping those boosters down where they
08:19 cut the top of the booster off in the
08:21 shot so the cranes up there holding it
08:23 and it bounces up and down in a really
08:25 you know illogical way but there's two
08:28 halves to the equation of you know
08:31 faking space exploration or faking
08:35 satellite launches or whatever and then
08:36 actually telling the public that you're
08:40 doing in and it's for real and let's
08:44 just think about hey let's let's just
08:45 draw a correlation between chemtrails
08:47 and SpaceX faking stuff putting a rover
08:51 in space completely goddamn fake I mean
08:55 unbelievably faked the car would have
08:57 exploded twisted turned it would never
09:00 have survived outer space if it's
09:03 anything like they say maybe if space is
09:05 something completely different and you
09:07 know that upper upper
09:08 part of the firmament dome maybe I can
09:11 totally survive out there no problem but
09:14 terms of the vacuum of space zero Kelvin
09:17 no way no way at dashboards going down
09:20 to 270 degrees below zero and it's just
09:23 gonna sit there no problem but for
09:26 everyone who believes that queuing on is
09:28 real then and that the military is
09:31 supporting Donald Trump
09:33 that's the assertion trust the plan
09:36 these chemtrails would be over my head
09:39 because this has this is military
09:42 airspace up there if there was a cabal
09:44 and previous administrations look the
09:47 other way
09:47 I get they make sense that could be
09:50 sprayed and you know Obama would be
09:52 telling somebody in a bush and Clinton
09:54 and everybody don't touch those points
09:56 there and you know they load up in
09:59 special NASA hangars on Air Force bases
10:01 and then they launch and they do
10:02 something you don't need to know about
10:04 take your orders shut up but the highest
10:09 level someone has to have some type of
10:11 story to aerosol the public and get
10:15 everyone in sick because that's what
10:18 happens I don't give a [ __ ] what you
10:21 think those things are they make people
10:24 sick so someone has to have a story
10:27 someone has to have a story that people
10:28 actually believe oh you know what your
10:30 shield for global warming global warming
10:33 is a bunch of [ __ ] complete [ __ ]
10:35 99.9% of all that stuff up there is
10:37 water the rest of its a mix of
10:39 everything there's as much there's as
10:42 much co2 in the atmosphere as there is
10:44 oxygen on the surface of the Sun okay in
10:48 fact it may even be that there's more
10:50 oxygen on the surface of the Sun then
10:53 there is co2 in the atmosphere so
10:56 someone's told a story and it's a good
10:59 one
11:00 you could only threaten so much before
11:03 miscast Bakker is gonna save Superman in
11:06 the pool and say you know you're welcome
11:09 to try to you know grab both nuclear
11:12 missiles but my mother lives on the east
11:17 coast and I'm not going to save you -
11:18 you promised me you're saving my mother
11:20 first sort of thing
11:21 right for those of you saw the
11:23 Christopher Reeve Star or Superman back
11:26 in the day but now SpaceX you know the
11:30 theories that we have discussed on this
11:31 show is that NASA obviously has a big
11:34 problem I don't think they worry about
11:36 Jack Parsons laboratory now known as Jet
11:41 Propulsion Laboratory big story there by
11:44 the way you need to look up Jack Parsons
11:46 you need to look up all of his buddies
11:48 at the time of the formation of the
11:50 company and a little house in Pasadena
11:52 before it turned into this fortress
11:56 protected by armed guard you know the
11:59 other area 51 is probably right
12:01 Patterson Air Force Base and JPL in
12:05 Pasadena but they I think that they
12:09 believe that all of the shenanigans and
12:11 CG that's been passed off as photographs
12:13 and edited photographs on composite CG
12:16 photographs the JPL does to sell us the
12:19 idea that Rovers that were only supposed
12:21 to last 11 months on the surface of Mars
12:23 are nearly going on 20 years and that
12:27 the solar panels that they use to get
12:31 power from just need to flap their wings
12:33 and then all is good when if you go look
12:37 at the solar panel farms here and in
12:40 America and watch how they have to labor
12:43 to clean them otherwise they don't work
12:45 you would realize that even if you could
12:48 shake the panel's you're not going to
12:51 remove dust off these things enough to
12:55 keep them running for 17 years or
12:58 something right but if you think about
13:00 it when we've been really critical and
13:03 you you know you post something on
13:04 facebook or you make a video on YouTube
13:09 we're always saying NASA NASA NASA NASA
13:11 well JPL I think is damn near two-thirds
13:15 of NASA in terms of implementation of a
13:20 hoax in that they want to make sure
13:22 people believe it because NASA has to
13:24 build a hangar and have you know clean
13:27 rooms that have the satellites in them
13:29 and stuff right all wrapped up
13:30 beautifully and my buddies Kyle from the
13:33 other show he's been through those
13:35 tours and you can go get tours from JPL
13:38 as well but GPL doesn't have the same
13:41 requirement it's just all in enigma
13:45 supercomputers doing things you know
13:48 again I met the two guys from the 80s
13:51 that worked on Tron 1982 and they said
13:55 they worked 13 years for GPL creating
13:57 photo realistic terrain generation
13:59 software so at another 20 years to that
14:03 and that's how many years they've been
14:05 working 40 years to create software to
14:09 fake alien terrains on planets any
14:14 terrain you can conceive the software
14:17 can do it and do it photo real down to
14:18 every grain of sand on the beach every
14:21 grain of sand in the desert but what
14:24 seal I must have been saying recently
14:25 right let's move around here the press
14:30 conference he gave was about his new
14:32 project starship now I'm gonna say
14:37 because I've been building up to is this
14:39 is the following the story behind faking
14:42 space travel may simply be let's just
14:45 say there's there's two halves to it for
14:47 those of you believe the earth is flat
14:49 it's a massive deception to keep us from
14:53 our Creator supposedly as if these human
14:55 beings through a little bit of deception
14:57 could keep you away from your Creator
14:59 that's an insult to your Creator if
15:02 we're in some matrix see alien you know
15:08 contact lens then I would say that they
15:11 are either working for those individuals
15:14 or they are those individuals trying to
15:16 keep the illusion and internally so the
15:20 fish doesn't know it's in a tank because
15:23 that it would try to escape now that's
15:25 the flatter side of things but the
15:27 normal heliocentric expanding earth ball
15:29 theory in an ether o universe the game
15:35 would be to perhaps launder a you know a
15:38 ton of money billions and billions of
15:40 dollars like for instance the most
15:43 expensive painting on earth was a
15:45 Michelangelo painting that so like 450
15:48 million
15:48 dollars okay half a billion dollars for
15:51 a painting and the rumor on the street
15:55 is that is not really a painting that
16:00 anybody desires that much it's the
16:03 painting is passed around to people that
16:05 are supposed to get payoffs and so let's
16:08 say that you did something for the deep
16:09 state the painting arrives in a package
16:12 you take it to some auction house they
16:15 auction it off for 450 million I gets
16:18 deposited into your bank account and
16:21 then the painting train trades hands and
16:24 it just gets moved around whoever needs
16:27 the Paycheck it's a way to launder money
16:29 or it's a way to pay someone off without
16:32 creating a bad trail well I sold that
16:34 painting now a little bit that's a
16:37 little ludicrous in terms of passing the
16:39 painting around but you know there's
16:41 ways of legitimizing everything right
16:44 but one of the strategies that someone
16:47 might have created a story around in
16:49 terms of getting everyone on board as
16:51 someone goes up to Elon Musk when he all
16:53 he wants to do is make a Roadster car
16:55 using computer batteries that's what
16:58 he's really interested in he's been a
16:59 physicist and this and that but someone
17:02 says how'd you like to do this kid but
17:04 rockets in space
17:05 guys like hell yeah but out you know I'm
17:09 you know I know enough to be dangerous
17:11 about aerospace but I'm not an aerospace
17:13 engineer necessarily plus nASA has been
17:17 doing it for years JPL has been doing it
17:18 for years let's say he believes the you
17:20 know the high EP strengths the kool-aid
17:21 like we all did and they bring him a
17:24 signing iron
17:24 here's the thing man we never went to
17:27 the moon we've we've never been out to
17:29 the planets all that guy that shot of
17:31 Jupiter all faked they shot a Pluto with
17:34 Pluto's face on it all fake right back
17:37 in the 80s the 90s are whenever they hit
17:41 the probe on Venus you know they
17:43 supposedly they faked this terrain data
17:47 when just like two days ago they came
17:49 out and said Venus is all lava now all
17:52 of a sudden and can't support life it
17:54 never did support life all this Neil
17:57 deGrasse Tyson horseshit about how Venus
18:00 and Mars were completely
18:02 one class planets and like Earth and our
18:08 Gaia class planets excuse me and you
18:11 know supported oceans and sea life and
18:13 all this other crap I mean just all
18:14 bold-faced lies based on nothing it's
18:19 unbelievable right so someone might have
18:24 sold him the story of like okay we're
18:27 going to start with BS we're gonna give
18:29 you a ton of cash and you know we do
18:31 have rocket technology we're gonna sell
18:33 you the most or we're gonna bring you
18:35 the most reliable launch platforms you
18:37 pick up a cool name so it calls it
18:39 Falcon nine if you look up every rocket
18:42 that looks like a Falcon 9 for the
18:43 previous 30 years there's a French
18:46 rocket that looked like the Falcon 9 I
18:47 forgot its name looks even like the
18:50 heavy Falcon it's the most reliable you
18:54 know third-party launch platform on
18:56 planet earth it's like there's no Rd
18:58 just you know you can make it better if
19:01 you want it'd be hard be harder to make
19:04 a Tesla car than the Falcon or the
19:06 Phalke the Falcon 9 or the heavy Falcon
19:09 it would it's more innovation in the car
19:13 but he gives us press conference about
19:15 the starship and it's it's like going
19:20 from Zefram Cochrane being a drunk to
19:27 for those of you don't know that's the
19:30 Star Trek a fictional character that
19:31 broke the warp barrier for mankind such
19:35 that the Vulcans landed and made first
19:37 contact with us right so according to
19:40 Elon Musk the amount of progress is
19:42 going to occur in the next five years is
19:45 us essentially becoming a Gene
19:47 Roddenberry star venturing people where
19:51 we're you know he he theorized at this
19:53 interview now and this is not to be
19:54 taken literally but he theorized that he
19:56 could do a thousand launches in one year
19:59 which is like you know roughly three and
20:05 a half four launches the day of this
20:09 starship
20:11 he I believe is talking about building
20:14 another ship in space which is you know
20:17 von braun's original plan in the mid
20:20 50's it's the thing that Disney animated
20:22 in the 50s I'll have to look that up
20:23 yourself
20:24 we've got von Braun Disney you know
20:27 mission to the moon 1956 or 55 somewhere
20:31 in there and you will see an amazing
20:33 animation that Walt Disney had created
20:35 to explain von Braun's idea that looks
20:38 very similar to the movie 2001 a Space
20:40 Odyssey but about 1213 years before now
20:46 the idea is that if if someone sold the
20:48 story okay we're going to lie but the
20:52 benefit is that we're gonna get a lot of
20:54 kids interested in science and then
20:56 we're gonna benefit well most of you
20:59 heard the dirty word in that statement
21:01 which is science we teach crap science
21:06 all day long I mean I see it in movies
21:10 and TV 24/7 I hear people talking about
21:13 it and it's it's a hell of a thing to
21:18 have someone tell you that you know some
21:22 evil group in the world is gonna get
21:24 everyone upside down and what they think
21:27 what they think is real is fake and what
21:29 is fake they think is real that's a
21:32 heavy claim it's like okay you know it's
21:35 a neat idea for a movie it's a good
21:37 premise for a movie but when you start
21:40 seeing it in real life and you have to
21:42 argue people out of stupid if you do go
21:45 this route if you argue people out of
21:47 stupid theories that make no sense it's
21:51 phenomenal and I could probably do an
21:54 entire episode on this but let me throw
21:57 this at you you know there are people
22:00 out there that want to be smart more
22:02 than they want to be right I have one of
22:05 these in my family I probably of several
22:07 these in my family and you know what is
22:11 the difference between being intelligent
22:14 and smart for real and going around with
22:19 the chip on your shoulder that you're
22:22 you have like these people that want to
22:24 be
22:25 but don't put any effort into it and I
22:28 respect anyone who might be wrong but
22:30 they're still trying to get right
22:31 they're still researching in there
22:33 they're taking theory out of book and
22:36 trying to get it to work in real life
22:38 and observable reality I totally respect
22:41 the fact if someone's still crawling up
22:43 the red pill you know the red pill
22:45 hasn't completely dissolved in their
22:46 mind yet hey you can be in my opinion
22:49 completely wrong but trying and
22:51 therefore you get an A for the day but
22:54 it's the people that want to lean on
22:57 this sort of like if somebody says well
23:00 hey hey no no deGrasse Tyson totally
23:04 disagrees with you right that's a person
23:07 who doesn't want to do any of their own
23:08 research they want to lean on other
23:10 people that are literally getting
23:12 paychecks to lie to the public
23:14 Neil deGrasse Tyson's job whether he is
23:16 aware of it or not is to lie to everyone
23:19 he opens his mouth and talks to seeming
23:24 genuine and people believe it that's his
23:30 paycheck that's his job Bill Nye the
23:34 complete douchebag guy he's an actor
23:37 he's an actor that had a civil
23:39 engineering degree has nothing to do
23:41 with what he talks about trying to tell
23:42 your child that despite the genetic
23:45 indication between their legs their
23:47 gender is up for grabs men remember
23:52 lying to a child is the heaviest sin you
23:55 could possibly do in this universe and
23:56 Neil deGrasse Tyson and Bill Nye the
23:59 douchebag guy make it a career you know
24:03 Neil deGrasse Tyson could turn around
24:04 and say oh my god I do have a PhD I
24:07 could just stop
24:08 you know regurgitating you know vomitus
24:12 information of inaccuracies and go
24:15 research things go study Faraday to
24:17 Tesla and block everything else out go
24:21 research Einstein's complete fraudulent
24:23 paper work where he cited no sources but
24:27 you know which indicates he knows
24:28 absolutely everything but he invented
24:31 everything yeah he could come around
24:35 Bill Nye he'll never have a chance
24:38 that guy is just one of those scumbag
24:41 dudes man
24:43 so what's the point of its lying to
24:47 children to inspire children if that is
24:50 indeed something that has been thought
24:52 because I've said it several times on
24:54 the show what I'm talking about the moon
24:55 missions that I know that the fake moon
24:59 missions inspired me to get into science
25:01 it did but also you know such as in
25:05 contrast to fakery 2001 a Space Odyssey
25:09 how 9,000 and even just the spaceship
25:13 and all that stuff the Space Station all
25:15 of the theoretical technology and a
25:17 fictional film that was sold to me is
25:19 fiction inspired me to get into
25:22 artificial intelligence engineering in
25:25 general you know to go and try to digest
25:28 as much aerospace and rocketry is I
25:34 could possibly get my hands on as a
25:35 child
25:36 okay so fiction could at one minut level
25:42 get a kid sort of in the right direction
25:45 but obviously if we're gonna teach
25:47 science the religion of science the Big
25:51 Bang Theory's black holes dark matter
25:57 then we're losing we're absolutely
26:01 losing and you know it only dawned on me
26:05 in the last week or so that you know if
26:07 those of you who believed that religion
26:09 organized religion on earth has been
26:11 devised to control man right every
26:14 archetype is God is there
26:17 but whatever chain of events you believe
26:19 in your salvation is only accessible
26:22 through another man and on this planet
26:26 right now
26:27 you know pedophiles typically are those
26:30 people and so you got our problem so you
26:34 run away from religion organized you
26:37 know spiritual religion and you try to
26:39 find a solution over an atheist secular
26:42 science with the capital S and flying
26:44 quotes well then you get indoctrinated
26:48 about how the universe was created
26:51 about what's actually out there what
26:53 spaces what's a planning what shape is
26:55 the earth have we been in space you know
26:57 all these fake shots of the Earth's from
26:59 space
27:00 I just saw some special somewhere or he
27:04 were talking about the first shot of the
27:07 earth the blue marble shot and they
27:09 showed it on the TV and it's the edited
27:14 version I'll put up on this right now
27:16 the classic when I'm shown several times
27:18 but the first blue marble shot the Red
27:20 Sea was all screwed up because it was a
27:22 composite shot created by a bunch of
27:26 high-altitude planes they screwed it up
27:28 but then they fixed it and didn't tell
27:32 you know the public that they did I sent
27:36 that to a relative of mine who doubted
27:38 you know it was given me that superior
27:41 complex without any knowledge and I mean
27:45 no knowledge in this at all has never in
27:48 their life ever attempted to know this
27:51 information sent them the two shots look
27:54 this is NASA 1972 this is NASA 2019
27:59 they've edited the shot the Madagascar
28:04 and the shape of Africa is the wrong
28:06 shape he doesn't even match the Peter
28:09 projection map shape so let's completely
28:12 fraudulent no reply back right standard
28:15 Democrat show them the proof that
28:17 they're completely wrong and they just
28:19 crawl back in the sand it's a sad thing
28:23 man but according to Elon Musk and
28:26 SpaceX man you know this is a guy who
28:29 said in 2017 that he's gonna personally
28:31 step onto Mars in 2018 it's two years
28:35 after it's like Elizabeth Warren saying
28:38 she's Cherokee you know it's its Biden
28:42 Singh and he didn't get a guy fired in
28:45 the Ukraine even though he's on video
28:46 bragging in front of a bunch of dudes
28:49 this is the cognitive dissidence it's
28:51 all over the world that is unacceptable
28:56 Elon Musk he tells the crowd what they
28:58 want to hear they get in line and the
29:02 funny thing is no one went up to the
29:04 microphone
29:05 said hey dude you said you were gonna be
29:06 on the surface of Mars personally in
29:09 2018 whatever happened to that no
29:13 there's no accountability because in
29:15 their eyes that's the new Jesus and no
29:19 matter how much that guy cleaned to be
29:21 coming back to save humanity dude never
29:25 shows back up again and they just keep
29:27 well they'll eventually get there okay
29:31 Trump created the space force if you
29:36 guys see my episode about a month and a
29:37 half before he did that or it's called
29:39 replacing NASA that is exactly what I
29:42 asserted in the episode which is okay
29:45 let's say you wanted to dominate low
29:48 atmospheric satellites geocentric as
29:53 geostationary at its highest but you do
29:57 want to have to get be attached to the
30:00 previous slides about the moon missions
30:02 previous lies or follow up lies about
30:04 where you're going with this technology
30:06 it's just for the military that's all
30:09 Ness has ever been is a military
30:12 organization formed by Nazis out of
30:14 World War two Operation Paperclip the
30:18 Dulles brothers smuggled in 1200 to 1700
30:22 scientists a recently other number
30:24 increased in some video I saw but you
30:26 know at least half of those folks went
30:29 often did the CIA and the other half did
30:31 NASA LaVon brawn one of the guys okay
30:37 and you know what's funny about is that
30:39 we have to fight these battles online I
30:41 mean I'm being a little romantic here
30:43 but are exaggerating just a little bit
30:46 if I told you a million times don't
30:49 exaggerate but let's just say that we
30:51 had 1,200 pedophiles we had 1,200
30:56 pedophiles and we separate them into two
30:58 groups one half goes informs the
31:02 Catholic Church and the other half forms
31:04 the Boy Scouts everybody at the time
31:07 who's awake is gonna wait a minute you
31:08 can't stick these pedophiles in these
31:10 two locations because they have access
31:11 to kids one way worse than the other but
31:14 because parents commit sin
31:17 they want to be forgiven they'll do
31:19 anything to please a priest so here's my
31:21 child you know do what you want to do so
31:24 fast-forward 40 50 years from this
31:27 invention of NASA and we say oh yeah the
31:31 pedophiles touched the kids in Boy
31:34 Scouts is the public in shock
31:38 no you form the whole thing out of a
31:40 bunch of people that are predators so
31:43 you have a bunch of military missile
31:45 people who enveloped fitted the v1
31:48 rocket plane thing and then the v2
31:50 rocket itself and then of course when
31:52 they came over and formed NASA they
31:55 needed a cover story developed to
31:57 develop ICBMs and submarine you know
32:02 aquatic missiles that can come out of
32:04 the side of a submarine hit the air pop
32:06 the shell off and go of course they need
32:09 a cover story the nice thing about space
32:12 force for me is now you're just saying
32:14 that's the organization you've developed
32:16 and that's great
32:18 like I said in that episode you would
32:21 have you could create any type of
32:24 propulsion system on earth even
32:25 anti-gravity propulsion systems which
32:28 are not allowed to be used in the in the
32:30 public and there it is it's a black box
32:34 it's that literally it could be a black
32:36 module that you could install inside
32:39 your rocket and you know publish specs
32:41 about how you can hang on to this thing
32:43 and how you should structurally hang on
32:44 to it and space force goes okay we're
32:48 gonna get that into space we're gonna
32:50 get that to the moon Mars or whatever
32:51 you never get to look at what that black
32:54 box has inside of it but it's
32:56 anti-gravity it's a little interface you
33:00 know here there's a little few knobs on
33:02 the front tire some monkey to get in
33:04 there and turn those knobs when you need
33:06 to what saddens me about this whole
33:09 algorithm of lying to the people and
33:12 submitting you know computer-generated
33:13 imagery as reality is that again in the
33:19 computer you can do whatever you want
33:22 reality's way more brutal so imagine for
33:26 instance the way that we actually enter
33:30 space
33:31 Travel say space exists even though no
33:33 one can dream of it
33:34 you take Star Trek all what five you
33:42 know shows from the 60s and the four
33:45 from 87 to 2005 and you say we're going
33:49 to start space travel by trying to
33:52 construct the enterprise a very
33:57 illogical looking ship we're going to
34:00 try and create this warp drive we are
34:02 going to try and create dilithium
34:04 crystals we're going to try and create
34:07 transporters and you keep going after
34:10 these things that are fictional
34:12 archetypes and stories instead of doing
34:16 what you would have to do which is start
34:18 with what you know well what do we
34:20 really know about traveling close to the
34:23 speed of light or disassembling some
34:26 object into its molecular particles
34:28 putting it through a beam and you know
34:31 replaying them on the other side what do
34:34 we really know so for me a large part of
34:37 SpaceX is about [ __ ] I'm just gonna
34:41 say it
34:42 it's just say what you want it's all out
34:46 of sight out of mind
34:47 I think what's very interesting about
34:50 Elon Musk's his claims recently as he's
34:54 talking about launching thousands of
34:56 citizens from the United States of
34:58 America and the world into space to head
35:01 off to the Space Station's how do you
35:04 validate it how do you validate it
35:08 couldn't you come up with a thousand
35:09 actors every SpaceX launch is is
35:12 orchestrated like a Hollywood moment in
35:15 time all these young millennial kids
35:18 sitting in some Lobby with a little oh
35:21 like an applause screams sign off and on
35:24 like a Jay Leno you know talk show set
35:26 and they're screaming and hollering and
35:30 it's just so fake if you feel extreme in
35:35 the screen but if you don't then don't
35:36 but you can see these kids being cued
35:38 they have warm-up acts
35:41 that go out to the crowd and warm
35:43 everyone up you guys ready to be here
35:45 it's like launching a new target or
35:48 something right with any of those you
35:50 know god-awful reincarnations of we will
35:54 rock you from Queen by stopping on the
35:56 linoleum and clapping their hands for
35:57 some guy that's tone-deaf and can't hold
35:59 a beat now the other factor that's kind
36:03 of going on right now is there appears
36:08 to be and I saw this thing yesterday I I
36:12 still can't even believe my eyes
36:14 the Chinese submitted a photograph of
36:18 one of the most ridiculous looking
36:19 things I've ever seen in my life
36:21 it's this black weird thing I mean it
36:25 almost looks like some part out of a
36:27 carnival ride or something they claim
36:32 they have a flying saucer thing if you
36:34 haven't seen this it's hilarious I'll
36:35 try to put a picture of it in here they
36:37 can travel 400 miles an hour okay
36:42 no no imagery of this thing taken off
36:45 flying around landing none of that just
36:49 a big [ __ ] lie about what they have
36:52 right and I should say that nearly every
36:57 single time you've had a propaganda
36:59 parade by a third-world country this
37:02 includes Russia as well but Russia is a
37:03 pretty pretty decent container but they
37:06 just faked their footage of their
37:07 supersonic missile that's been proven
37:11 when you have a parade and North Korea
37:14 did a really funny one within the last
37:16 year or one of the tips of the missiles
37:18 was like hanging off these are props
37:21 people these are props these fake
37:24 missiles I'm sure Russ s done Russia has
37:26 done it maybe even the United States has
37:28 done it you know typically it's one of
37:31 the countries creates it for real and
37:33 the other countries are like oh oh yeah
37:34 yeah we have that too right you know
37:36 it's like Jon Lovitz talking about his
37:39 wife Morgan Fairchild right I was only
37:43 acting so there's appears to be like
37:47 this tongue-in-cheek you know arms race
37:51 going on right now between countries and
37:54 okay
37:55 so what if you got into the Oval Office
37:56 you're sitting there with President
37:57 Trump and he looks at you and he's like
38:00 so you make it videos that say that this
38:03 is all [ __ ]
38:04 and I said yeah I am well do you know
38:09 you're hurting your country and I say
38:11 how's that how is truth hurting the
38:13 country well it's it's not so much the
38:17 truth that's hurting the country it is
38:19 that you are telling people that we
38:21 don't have this and that we're faking it
38:23 and all the you don't goes you know how
38:25 many jobs we create by telling the
38:28 public that we're going to create a
38:29 brand new rocket here or a new missile
38:32 here or new stealth plane there I don't
38:36 know sir how many people is that he's
38:38 like a hundred thousand employees across
38:41 the United States
38:42 totaling you know 250 million dollars a
38:46 year in annual salaries if you expose
38:49 this then you are getting a hundred
38:51 thousand people to lose their jobs and
38:54 Array be millions hell I don't know
38:57 and 250 million dollars doesn't
38:59 circulate around the United States so I
39:00 need you to shut the hell up because
39:02 that's what's most important the
39:04 previous administration's Republican and
39:07 Democrat have gutted the economy I'm
39:10 trying to bring it back yeah we're gonna
39:12 fudge a little bit of this but overall
39:16 this works and by the way our
39:18 competition in Russia China India
39:21 Pakistan Israel they're totally into
39:24 this fake thing as well
39:26 so they're gonna create those jobs
39:28 they're gonna keep their people employed
39:30 and by the way even though a lot of this
39:34 is fake there's a margin of real
39:36 development taking place behind the
39:38 scenes that may actually end up being
39:40 the technology that we're faking so by
39:43 green letting all these projects and
39:45 pulling all these people in it's better
39:47 that we lie and to get there than it is
39:51 for us to try and tell the truth and get
39:53 there and then I say well sir mr. Trump
39:56 President Trump what about Elon Musk you
39:59 know private industry lies about
40:03 everything constantly he says he's seen
40:04 artificial intelligence that will wipe
40:06 out mankind but what
40:08 even one sentence of what the hell he
40:10 saw essentially making it all bs it's
40:14 like the guy who has the girlfriend you
40:16 could never meet but she's as hot as hot
40:18 as hot right and he says that well did
40:22 you see the interview he did in front of
40:24 his starship with all these nerds
40:25 walking up to the microphone yes I did
40:28 sir it was very very heart wrenching and
40:30 gut-wrenching and and heartbreaking he
40:36 says why they absolutely believed in
40:38 this religion and so they're gonna go
40:40 off and they're gonna work and they're
40:41 gonna publish a bunch of blogs and
40:43 newspapers and magazines and they're
40:45 gonna get everyone excited about the
40:47 greater conspiracy hoax which is this
40:50 other stuff we just talked about them
40:52 whatever a hundred thousand million
40:54 people make it a ton of money
40:56 it feels an industry that pumps the
41:01 heart of our country so then I asked the
41:06 $64,000 question for those of you
41:08 remember the 70s and I say well when are
41:12 we gonna start telling the truth I mean
41:13 is there ever a goal to tell the truth
41:16 and president Trump says what is truth
41:19 man what is it we live in a spiritual
41:23 world we watch movies you ever go see
41:26 movies yes sir i watch movies well do
41:28 you like them yep well do you believe
41:29 star wars actually exists out there in
41:31 the universe and a galaxy far far away a
41:34 long time ago
41:35 no but do you enjoy it yeah so what's
41:39 the difference if we fudge a little bit
41:41 of the fictional inspirational stuff art
41:44 into reality and everyone has a better
41:47 time than believing that there's a cabal
41:51 of bankers out there that have
41:53 Bilderberg meetings see if our meetings
41:55 Bohemian Grove meetings and they're
41:57 eating your children which part do you
41:59 want people to believe in I'd say well I
42:02 prefer to pull the band-aid off sir then
42:06 he disagrees or he says well we'll get
42:09 that band-aid off but unfortunately we
42:11 can't yank it off you see how crazy
42:14 Democrats are could you imagine them
42:16 having to deal with reality anytime soon
42:19 we'd have to fill up we'd have to build
42:21 you know psychiatric wards as much as we
42:24 build FEMA camps just a house crazy
42:28 Democrats that are literally going you
42:30 know being in padded rooms with
42:32 straitjackets trying to eat each other's
42:34 face off and then I'd probably say you
42:37 got me you got me man yeah you're right
42:41 so let's think about where this whole
42:44 story might go because NASA has
42:47 announced they're going back to the moon
42:48 in 2024 and what's funny about that
42:51 there's a whole section on their website
42:52 about it I'm yet to meet a friend who
42:57 knows that that was announced it was
43:01 kind of a big deal in the 60s right JFK
43:04 says let's go go to the moon and come
43:07 back safely put some put a man on the
43:09 moon and bring it back home safely we do
43:12 it six times without any problems
43:15 perfect perfect perfect slash maybe
43:17 Apollo 13 having an issue Russians can't
43:21 pull it off and no one else has been
43:23 able to do it including us right
43:25 evidence of the hoax we all know that
43:27 that's the thing so what's 2024 gonna be
43:32 well we know it's gonna be complete BS
43:36 but let's say again and I you know I'm
43:39 not a fear-mongering kind of guy but
43:40 let's just say again that someone is
43:42 wink-wink nudge-nudge iing about 5g
43:44 killing off the planet hence all the
43:46 FEMA coffins right and they're not
43:50 worried about accountability in 2024
43:52 because they've got some other agenda
43:54 way before that to kill off humanity
43:57 what do you think agenda 21
43:59 slash agenda 2030 is all about it's
44:03 about destroying rural communities
44:07 around the world
44:08 forcing them to live in two cities which
44:10 they call equity or human equity to
44:13 those that want this to happen the --use
44:15 entire formation and goal is to bankrupt
44:20 Europe get them to consolidate because
44:23 they're so bankrupt and obviously infect
44:26 us they're gonna have a bit of a problem
44:29 for a while but their goal is to
44:31 depopulate the planet
44:33 by 98% at least go see the Georgia
44:39 Guidestones and so maybe this whole
44:43 thing is a big last play so there's two
44:47 anti queue things that I want you to
44:50 think about one I've got metric tons of
44:54 barium oxide and aluminum oxide nano
44:58 sized made in some military facility
45:00 floating in the air above my head coming
45:02 out having come out of the back of a
45:04 plane this should be a blue sky day
45:07 coast-to-coast or rise into horizon okay
45:11 so that's still up there second our
45:16 president is championing 5g the
45:22 euthanizing technology that will kill
45:28 off the entire United States of America
45:30 right it'll be very interesting because
45:33 there will be no 4G or 3G and any love
45:38 at any level after they deploys now that
45:41 may take five or ten years to pull that
45:43 off but as this starts to have ill
45:45 effects on human beings will have to
45:49 literally take matters into our own
45:51 hands and climb up or not eat can you
45:54 get close to him right I have to get
45:56 your shotgun out and just shoot the [ __ ]
45:57 out of the receivers and hope that you
46:00 can stop it well literally have five G
46:03 green zones where we've destroyed all
46:05 the receivers and because it's such a
46:07 tight you know centimeter long frequency
46:12 you'll be safe in a particular area
46:14 which one out any cell phone reception
46:17 someone from our European listening
46:20 community did come into the comment
46:22 section and say that they're already
46:24 being pitched 5g I don't know if that's
46:28 true but that would be in the island of
46:31 Great Britain what they did for Q was
46:36 they somebody came into the Q anonymous
46:39 comments and posted this this story
46:42 about how they are going to release
46:44 cures to cancer
46:47 which just happens to coincide with cure
46:52 well with the deployment of 5g so
46:54 imagine that they know 5g is gonna shred
46:56 all your cells that's supposedly gonna
46:58 be able to take a pill or a shot of some
47:01 sort and all your cells are gonna get
47:03 repaired on a daily basis so I want to
47:07 we're gonna tear apart our DNA with
47:09 these high frequency transmitters and
47:11 then supposedly you can just put a
47:12 bandaid on it it's all going to be
47:14 better yeah right so there's two anti
47:18 proofs that this is real or even if it
47:21 is real that this is a good idea to
47:24 trust the plan I'll trust the plan the
47:26 second these planes get shot out of the
47:28 sky over the Pacific Ocean and I can
47:30 just sit right here recording a show and
47:32 here comes a plane dump on a trail and I
47:35 want to see two f-18 Hornets rendezvous
47:38 with that thing and just shoot missile
47:40 after missile I just watch it explode
47:42 over the ocean be awesome right who ever
47:46 would have thought that the next you
47:47 know right of the Nazis would have been
47:50 geo engineers I mean seriously if you
47:54 know a Geo engineer you're looking at
47:57 the witch doctors of the future so what
48:01 a touch on flat earth as well because
48:04 you know this thing comes out in 2014-15
48:07 heavy and I mean strong and I didn't
48:10 know this but I was told recently that
48:12 it actually came out of Great Britain
48:13 but that's where the movement started
48:15 which is very interesting because I
48:17 think globally it's fairly well
48:19 perceived that the education in Great
48:21 Britain is well far more superior than
48:24 the one in America even though you're
48:28 taught to you know worship monarchies
48:30 and metal thing and you don't have any
48:32 second Amendment to protect your rights
48:34 but it blew up right we were all there
48:37 and some of you guys are still pursuing
48:39 it which I love I mean you have to know
48:41 I really love the fact you guys are
48:43 still pushing on it so it went away
48:47 though for about a year and a half last
48:49 two years or so it's really sort of
48:51 calmed down it's not the people reverse
48:55 their belief systems or anything it's
48:57 just that you know they've talked about
48:58 all the issues what else can you do
49:00 I will say the one thing that makes me
49:03 gag and some of you post videos like
49:06 this just know that my response is going
49:08 to be like this is some dude standing on
49:11 some corner showing off some fairly
49:13 decent concepts to get people to
49:15 question which that's the part I like
49:18 but then they crawl into the Bible to
49:22 prove their point and then again it's
49:24 it's like it would be for me quoting the
49:28 Bible to prove the Bible is like me
49:30 reading from a screenplay to prove my
49:32 screenplay is a true story what is
49:34 righteousness if you look up the
49:36 definition it says righteousness
49:38 okay all right well guess that's that's
49:41 a real word then since you used the word
49:43 to define itself so but recently I guess
49:48 what I want to say is that I've seen a
49:49 resurgence in this I haven't seen new
49:54 evidence and I haven't seen anyone
49:58 actually sorry I'll take that back one
50:01 of the interesting videos that keeps
50:03 going around recently as someone has
50:05 pulled out a 1958 Britannica
50:08 encyclopedia which for those of you who
50:11 may not have access to that or never
50:13 heard of that before in the United
50:14 States of America for many many years
50:16 before the internet Britannica was
50:18 considered the og encyclopedia for any
50:23 citizen and wanted them they're usually
50:24 leather-bound they used to cost you know
50:26 $5,000 for the A to Z books whereas the
50:30 World Encyclopedia was probably 500
50:33 dollars you know and was quite excellent
50:36 let me tell you but some guy but this
50:39 has happened in I thought it was one
50:41 video but I've now seen it and so many
50:45 videos I couldn't count but they opened
50:47 this book up and they say that when they
50:51 went to Antarctica they found a
50:54 featureless dome that at where they were
50:58 standing when they found the dome they
50:59 said that it's a went up 13,000 feet I
51:03 believe was what it said in the article
51:06 and so that's not the total height of
51:09 the dome but that's the curves they were
51:12 on
51:13 a featureless denim I thought that was
51:15 interesting it says dome right in the
51:18 freaking definition of I can't remember
51:20 where the hell they were looking I think
51:23 that's interesting part of me wants that
51:26 organization to hurry up hurry up and do
51:29 one of two things hurry up and prove
51:32 it's a dump hurry up and prove it's not
51:34 a dome but the after you get past the
51:37 ice-barrier there's another ocean out
51:39 there and there's other continents out
51:40 there prove that one or some one
51:45 billionaire with a g5 you know private
51:49 jet flies over Antarctica and a
51:51 continuous shot and proves it's a
51:54 continent down there okay one of the
51:58 other get this thing resolved so that we
52:00 can move on with life and again if it is
52:03 some sort of container Wow
52:05 do we get in trouble the second we find
52:08 out it's a container it seems like we
52:10 would it seems like if this was all a
52:13 simulation but we had compassion and
52:17 owners we are in some physical container
52:21 of some sort made to look round but it
52:22 isn't it even confuses me and the
52:24 expanding Earth theory that if we did
52:28 become conscious of the container that
52:31 they would have to do an extermination
52:32 event to reset history to keep the
52:36 biological experiment that is our world
52:38 going there is a famous Twilight Zone
52:41 where a dude was a bunch of other folks
52:44 goes to a believe Mars the vehicle they
52:48 travel in crashes all their dead but one
52:51 but they it's the guy that plays
52:55 Cornelius and the Planet of the Apes
52:57 series in the movie series but someone's
53:01 tapping on the door on the other side
53:02 and he's tapping and of course he's
53:04 freaked out because obviously there's
53:06 intelligent life on the other side of
53:07 the door he doesn't know if it's a
53:08 monster or someone interesting well he
53:11 opened the door and it's these no region
53:13 folks and this gorgeous blonde and you
53:17 know good-looking dudes it's like in
53:19 dolls and Barbies and he just instantly
53:22 falls in love with the girl but he
53:27 they take him to an apartment that looks
53:29 like his house or whatever it's all is
53:33 good until he realizes that he's in a
53:35 cage
53:36 he opens the blinds to the front of his
53:39 little pad and there's bars and he sees
53:41 the girl out there and all the people
53:43 and they're looking at him because he's
53:46 a captive in this cage right so
53:49 immediately he wants out it's just what
53:52 happens they talk about the floods that
53:55 have reset humanity I don't know what if
54:01 some of this stuff has occurred and it's
54:02 all to make sure that we reset our
54:05 brains back down to just be observed
54:08 that's all it's going on it's not it's
54:10 not even spiritual it's just you're in a
54:14 cage and we're looking at you or
54:16 watching how you do your thing you can
54:18 have your own nucular wars you can
54:21 genocide each other you can rape your
54:23 own kids we just want to see what you do
54:26 maybe if it's one of those things like
54:29 Star Trek where the enterprise flies
54:32 around the the galaxy observing
54:35 undiscovered cultures and what do they
54:37 always say well we observe you so that
54:41 we can learn more about ourselves
54:42 especially primitive man we want to know
54:45 how we may have done it ourselves
54:46 because we don't have that recorded on
54:48 video so I would say that the level of
54:52 lies have never been more elaborate and
54:55 consistent and so part of me thinks you
54:59 know what's the game here what's the
55:02 game why not tell the truth yeah this is
55:07 one of those horrible situations where
55:09 you know again you hear it all the time
55:11 don't tell lies because you have to
55:13 remember what your lies were and then
55:15 your truth if you want to espouse any
55:18 truth or come up with an additional lie
55:20 it's standing on the shoulders of your
55:22 previous deception and so you could
55:24 easily contradict yourself that's what
55:29 NASA did like crazy right NASA lied
55:31 about the Van Allen belts not existing
55:34 not being threatening and then when they
55:36 found out in 98 it was killing the
55:38 astronauts in the space shuttle
55:40 Oh Oh big problem Project Orion gets
55:46 greenlit a couple years ago well geez
55:48 like almost 4 or 5 years ago now one
55:50 mission it was cancelled and then all of
55:52 a sudden out of thin air now it wasn't
55:54 cancelled and it has solved all of the
55:56 vanillin belt problems yet the toxicity
56:00 of the Van Allen belts radiation is
56:01 still considered classified classifying
56:05 the radiation footprint of the Van Allen
56:08 belts is about as ridiculous as
56:10 classifying the speed of wind the
56:13 temperature of the ocean at any one
56:16 particular location and depth it's
56:19 ridiculous these are natural things that
56:23 exist and we need to know how they
56:25 perform so the individuals can start
56:28 fixing the problem we have astronauts
56:33 that are still alive that said they went
56:34 to the moon when they didn't and so now
56:38 they're stuck in a quandary their
56:40 pensions are attached to the lie you
56:45 tell the truth buddy not only you're
56:47 gonna die but your pensions gonna get
56:49 liquidated and so your family's going to
56:51 be left with no money and you know they
56:55 could just threaten all kinds of stuff
56:57 and you have to understand it if you're
56:59 say 25 today and you're hearing that
57:01 idea that you've told a lie now you can
57:03 tell the truth and you know undo
57:05 everything the guys from the era of the
57:08 60s and 70s have completely different
57:11 brains than you do what they fear is
57:14 completely different things than you
57:16 fear so what would motivate you won't
57:19 motivate them at all and we have to
57:22 always remember you know the the easiest
57:24 method of brainwashing is repetition how
57:29 many of you have had a lie be repeated
57:32 like maybe even global warming / climate
57:34 change now that it's getting cooler
57:36 right you've done your science you know
57:40 it's [ __ ] doesn't make any sense but
57:43 there's some microsecond of your life
57:47 where you hear it again for the ten
57:50 thousandth time in your life and for a
57:52 microsecond you're like
57:54 jeez could I be wrong could it be that
57:56 the you know head meteorologists and
57:58 mighty is wrong
57:58 could the NAT head patent holding
58:01 climatologist at NASA be wrong because
58:04 they've all said it's fake and then you
58:07 go on they're not they're not wrong the
58:09 first split second you contemplated it
58:11 because of the repetition you're an
58:15 astronaut you did not go to the moon but
58:19 for 50 years you've been lying to the
58:21 American people and the entire world
58:23 that you did you're in a you're in a
58:26 state of almost Stockholm Syndrome
58:27 because you know that you have been
58:29 threatened and because you're of an old
58:32 soul 60s brain set you know mindset I
58:36 should say you do fear that this is
58:39 really going to occur with you that you
58:40 have no protection that there's no
58:42 method of getting you know 50 cameras on
58:45 you from a Facebook live feeds and
58:47 YouTube live feeds and other live feeds
58:49 that aren't controlled by the deep state
58:51 and saying the truth are going up in
58:54 front of a podium on live television at
58:57 the White House and instead of reading
58:58 an encrypted message like Neil Armstrong
59:00 did before he died just simply saying
59:02 what he knows is true they sell them you
59:06 know patriotic BS in my opinion that if
59:10 you say this you say the truth you're
59:12 gonna make America look horrible so
59:14 don't do it keep going with the lie I
59:17 think that works if you believe if you
59:19 think that the majority of the planet
59:21 believes in the lie I'm not convinced I
59:24 mean what it wouldn't it be an amazing
59:26 god fact that's what I call God facts
59:28 you know you would just could
59:30 empirically know the truth about
59:32 something and you say what's the
59:33 percentage of people that believe went
59:35 to the moon and there's a percentage of
59:37 hovers in front of your face
59:38 written in standard old integer number
59:41 right in front of your face and you look
59:43 and it's 65% do not believe we went to
59:46 the moon 35 percent believe we did ah
59:50 well based on that metric you could
59:52 start telling the truth because the
59:54 majority of the world is going to
59:56 stabilize the other 35% and you know
59:59 people will go to their graves still
60:00 believing that the admission from an
60:02 astronauts due to dementia and not truth
60:06 but what's the story of Faust I've
60:11 mentioned this a couple times over 400
60:13 plus episodes what is the story of Faust
60:16 he's a mathematician that signs a deal
60:19 with the devil thinking that he is going
60:23 to trick the devil into giving him a
60:25 good deal when the devil is far more
60:28 intelligent than man in the story and
60:30 you always end up tanking it in the end
60:32 there's three or four great Twilight
60:34 zones all about this
60:36 well you never win joining the dark side
60:39 does crime pay oh yeah Oh totally the
60:43 biggest lion in the judicious judicial
60:47 system of the world as the crime doesn't
60:49 pay
60:49 give me a break crime totally pays
60:52 because we have to keep these heroes
60:55 propped up again if Prince Andrew for
60:58 instance did what we think he did on
61:00 Epstein's islands and other pin houses
61:02 and locations while he's sleeping with
61:04 minors you know if you sleep with a 17
61:07 year old it's not quite as bad as
61:09 sleeping with a 12 year old
61:10 but who knows once you enter the camp of
61:12 these crazies who knows right we have a
61:17 former president United States and went
61:18 there 26 plus times - Epstein island
61:21 leaving behind the Secret Service five
61:22 or six times we can only assume what
61:26 happened not something we would agree
61:30 with all right you know it's weird
61:33 because we not to digress but just to go
61:36 off on the lies that we accept you know
61:40 we have a communist country like China
61:43 that gets preferred trading status with
61:46 the United States of America and the
61:47 rest of the world because they're
61:48 willing to exploit their people to build
61:50 products well if this was happening in
61:54 our backyard we would we would
61:56 unceasingly act against that until it
61:59 was resolved when this is not allowed
62:01 but it's okay if it's over there and we
62:04 just simply chalk it up to its you know
62:06 it's a foreign planet with their own
62:07 culture but boy they make some iPhones
62:09 and Samsung phones really really well
62:11 right
62:12 I guess Sam's song is actually Korean
62:14 but you have places around the world
62:18 that
62:19 you know prostitution is not only
62:24 rampant and really sort of a deep double
62:29 percentage method of creating their
62:31 gross national product or gross domestic
62:33 product
62:33 but these people that and this is just
62:37 weird I've seen these videos where even
62:40 Vice has done it a couple times the the
62:42 the channel where these guys are going
62:43 down the street and there's all these
62:45 boys dressed like girls that's about 60%
62:48 of it but if you start looking at the
62:50 ages of these kids it becomes apparent
62:52 that some of these kids are really below
62:55 the international average of what we
62:57 consider to be consensual sex and not
63:01 only are they underage but by the time
63:03 you see their face on Vice how many
63:06 thousands of tricks of they turned
63:10 before the camera ever gets on their
63:12 face well there's what would be
63:14 considered typically international crime
63:16 especially if an American who knows
63:18 they're not supposed to be doing that
63:20 flies over there to get that type of sex
63:22 of underage kids you know and as a sort
63:28 of an Occam's razor contrast how many
63:32 times have you heard American big-game
63:35 hunters and the British royalty go to
63:37 Africa and hunt rhinos they hunt lions
63:41 and elephants and other you know amazing
63:44 creatures that some of them are in the
63:46 endangered species list they pose with
63:49 them dead and then we have this total
63:51 outrage about killing animals in Africa
63:54 look and I think we should right so the
63:57 idea and the premise with that is that
63:59 we can't leave our country where this
64:01 would not be allowed to go to another
64:03 country where it is allowed do it take a
64:06 picture and bring it back and celebrate
64:08 it so what would be the difference
64:11 between you know Bill Clinton going to
64:15 Epstein's island sleeping with a
64:17 thirteen-year-old and in the middle of
64:19 sex big thumbs up as a Secret Service
64:22 guy or Geoffrey himself snaps a shot of
64:24 a naked president with a minor in the
64:27 middle of sex and he puts it on
64:30 Instagram
64:32 Twitter well there you go you've left
64:35 our country where this would be
64:37 completely illegal and get you killed in
64:39 prison to go into a foreign country or
64:42 foreign island doing it and it's
64:45 suddenly okay
64:46 now no one is technically said that
64:49 doing it at epstein island was okay they
64:51 they know that that's a bad thing but go
64:54 to Thailand go to all these other
64:55 countries where kids are forced to sell
64:59 themselves to eat where's the invasion
65:02 where's the outrage right you know I've
65:06 said it a long time ago in my global
65:10 warming episode if climate change was
65:14 real then this is something and
65:17 especially the aoc crazy [ __ ] right you
65:20 know we got 10 years to live and she's
65:24 not gonna be able to have babies now
65:25 because of climate change
65:26 wow I hope she believes up but if that
65:30 was true that the world's gonna end
65:34 because of climate change it doesn't
65:37 matter if you're a Rothschild Windsor a
65:40 Habsburg king a queen of anything a coke
65:45 brother a Bush and Obama a Trump it
65:49 doesn't matter you would have less than
65:52 10 years to lip now maybe if you're
65:54 really really old you don't care cuz the
65:56 ten years will be dead anyway
65:57 but there's plenty of people that are
65:59 alive that are super powerful super rich
66:00 that would care what would happen well
66:04 you make one phone call to president
66:06 Chee and you say you have exactly 48
66:09 hours to shut down these factories we
66:12 are going to be emailing them to you
66:13 they've been identified as super carbon
66:15 footprint facilities we do not care what
66:20 corporation is using the benefits of
66:22 these factories you must shut them down
66:25 we're gonna bring you schematics for
66:29 safe energy so if you can continue using
66:33 your damn energy your hydroelectric you
66:35 can use anything that's safe but you
66:37 can't use these factories are we in
66:40 agreement now he's got two choices at
66:43 that point
66:44 screw you or okay but this isn't
66:50 happening
66:50 right because this isn't real but what
66:52 if he said screw you all right would be
66:57 the next part of the conversation okay
66:59 then we're gonna go to plan B your
67:03 country at these locations
67:05 and we're gonna try to keep it civilians
67:07 safe you need to know in the next 48
67:09 hours we're going to roll over your
67:13 country with stealth planes we're gonna
67:18 hit you from space with ion cannons
67:21 directed-energy weapon weapons and we're
67:24 going to liquefy all these locations so
67:28 you have a choice turn them off and keep
67:30 the hardware and you can cannibalize it
67:31 and recycle it or we're gonna wipe you
67:34 off the face of the map in these
67:35 particular areas we're gonna try to keep
67:37 all your people safe but you can't have
67:38 these factories that's what would happen
67:41 if climate change was was real the
67:45 United States of America have to do the
67:46 same thing India would have to do the
67:48 same thing every country that is barfing
67:50 out carbon if the world was gonna end
67:52 the you know ice caps are gonna melt
67:55 again the North Pole melts like but
67:57 every few years the whole thing melts
67:59 down to nothing and then refreezes back
68:01 up that's a natural cycle for that area
68:03 up there and you know if you think about
68:07 and there's plenty of tests I mean what
68:10 blew me away was I talked to a friend of
68:12 mine that disagree with me on this and
68:15 it's I didn't have the heart to get into
68:16 the conversation but let's say you go to
68:19 the local fast food place and you say
68:21 give me a drink a large coke large iced
68:25 tea they put a bunch ice in there they
68:27 pour the team and you don't drink a
68:30 single drop of it but you sit there and
68:32 look at it now all the ice is inside the
68:34 cup maybe a tiny millimeter fraction of
68:37 the ice breaks the surface of your cup
68:41 you're not going to have the cup
68:43 overflow all of a sudden because the ice
68:45 melted inside it's already displacing
68:47 the water as a matter of fact it
68:48 probably would go down infinitesimally
68:50 because the ice also has air in it well
68:54 have you ever seen in glacier in iceberg
68:56 you can't
68:58 see through them like an IceCube why
69:00 because they have metric tons or cubic
69:04 meters of air in them that's why they're
69:07 blue that's why they're white because it
69:09 has air in it well the majority of the
69:12 ice is actually already in the ocean so
69:14 that displacements already occurred so
69:17 it melts everywhere between the frozen
69:22 water and the ice bubbles you're
69:25 probably going to even out pretty much
69:27 you know maybe get a few inches tops if
69:30 you've melted it all in one day but the
69:32 idea that ice melting creates more
69:35 volume inside of a body of water is just
69:39 bunk - neat - any alarming degree plus
69:43 the South Pole is never gonna be hot
69:47 over it's never gonna be 32 degrees well
69:51 it's not going to be 33 degrees
69:52 Fahrenheit which is or may be like 0.01
69:55 Celsius right over freezing it's never
69:58 ever going to be warm enough to do that
70:00 so it's always going to be generating
70:02 new ice again the average temperature of
70:04 the South Pole is between 60 below zero
70:08 and about 20 below zero
70:10 your average temperature of the North
70:12 Pole is around zero Fahrenheit and 20 or
70:18 30 below depending on what kind of storm
70:19 might be going on up there now are these
70:22 trails contributing to moving the
70:24 Jetstream and putting warmer air where
70:28 it shouldn't be absolutely absolutely
70:32 there's the I forget the guy's last name
70:34 by the guy named Dane who really started
70:38 tracking chemtrails I believe he's got a
70:41 PhD but he helped invent solar panels
70:43 back in the day you know he's done a lot
70:46 of science on where the jet streams were
70:48 where chemtrails are sprayed and they
70:51 sit there and watch the the jet stream
70:53 maneuver around these artificially
70:57 stimulated high pressure zones again if
71:00 you spray a bunch of chemtrails and get
71:02 rid of storm fronts which are low
71:06 pressure zones then the Sun and the
71:08 atmosphere could push down through that
71:11 have resistance and create a high
71:12 pressure once you have high pressure
71:14 depending on how high the altitude goes
71:17 for the high pressure zone it'll move
71:19 the Jetstream Jetstream is extremely
71:22 powerful so luckily I think it's a it's
71:25 a dying it's a well it's a battle you
71:28 won't win so let me know what you think
71:31 about these space programs I'd be
71:35 interested in your solutions because we
71:36 can complain all day long we can compare
71:39 notes on what's been faked and what is
71:41 real but you know how you believe you
71:44 know the earth is a particular shape
71:46 well here's another question for flat
71:48 earthers how are you guys going to get
71:51 this thing proven how far away do you
71:53 think we are from getting it proven what
71:56 techniques do you think are most
72:00 conclusive all right do you have to go
72:03 to the dome ago knock knock knock I
72:05 think that would be awesome I'd be a
72:07 little afraid to try and fly over the
72:09 South Pole if I thought there was a dome
72:10 in the way right because you would smack
72:12 your ship right into it and die for
72:16 those of you think it's round but NASA
72:18 is still lying what's the what's the
72:21 plane do you dissolve NASA do you
72:24 dissolve Jet Propulsion laboratories
72:25 does it all just go into the space force
72:28 do astronauts need to tell the truth
72:31 does someone else need to leak the truth
72:34 they you know it's a big problem it's a
72:37 big quagmire we've got to figure out so
72:40 maybe out of our our process of working
72:44 together what if if the pedestrians of
72:46 the world came up with the solution and
72:48 then we made a bunch of videos about
72:49 that solution and then the government
72:51 hears it goes oh my god that would
72:53 actually work it would protect the baby
72:56 boomers with sore butts and get all the
72:58 Millennials to go finally I don't have
73:00 to live in a boatload of lies I mean the
73:04 amount of lies going on right now it's
73:05 just tremendous man I mean it's it's
73:09 like living in Freaky Friday from that
73:12 old book or Wacky Wednesday whichever
73:14 book you read where everything is weird
73:17 someone has three legs there's a shoe on
73:20 the side of the wall I mean everything's
73:22 funky and we're sitting
73:24 here like it's not funky we're watching
73:28 America literally be attacked by
73:31 socialists globalists who do not serve
73:35 this country taking a [ __ ] on everything
73:37 that is the Constitution we even have
73:39 Hillary Clinton calling the Constitution
73:42 basically a dirty old rag from the 1700s
73:45 that needs to be ripped up thrown away
73:48 and rebuilt Wow Wow dream up an enemy
73:54 that's worse than someone saying
73:57 something like that and that person is
73:59 actually thinking about running for a
74:01 president again Wow someone who takes a
74:06 [ __ ] on the very foundation of the
74:07 country that has been one of the
74:09 greatest experiments on the planet Earth
74:10 since maybe previous utopian Ares which
74:13 we don't know when and where those
74:15 occurred based on a bunch of great
74:17 thinking from Europe for the Magna Carta
74:19 it almost got that situated over there
74:22 if you think about the Constitution
74:25 being somehow this impenetrable document
74:27 I want you to realize that Magna Carta
74:28 which is the foundation for the
74:30 Constitution was hatched at around a
74:34 thousand AD well let's think about it
74:37 how much bad news in Europe did we have
74:39 from a thousand AD to 1920 19 however
74:44 you want to slice it horrible [ __ ]
74:47 happened over there after Magna Carta
74:49 was created because it was immediately
74:50 destroyed after it was created it can
74:54 happen again it can totally happen again
74:57 so again I think most of you know that
75:03 to build a really sturdy building or
75:05 house you have to have a great
75:06 foundation if the foundation of your
75:09 country is built on lies then your
75:13 demise is assured it's just a matter of
75:15 time we're all getting red pilled that's
75:19 fantastic
75:20 we need to continue red pilling people
75:22 until we get the overwhelming majority
75:24 of the world on one page at least the
75:26 civilized world that makes differences
75:28 you know fights these gigantic
75:30 electronic wars it has to occur
75:35 so I'm interested in your thoughts dump
75:37 them into the comments at YouTube and if
75:41 you haven't gone deep thoughts radio
75:43 calm that's where you can find all the
75:45 other videos that will set this video up
75:46 beautifully so there's two options for
75:50 video two for audio two for social media
75:52 at least two for donating and all new
75:57 Rhys remasters season one so while my
76:00 neighbor makes a ton of noise take care
76:03 of yourself in someone else and I'll see
76:04 you in the next deep thoughts over now
