00:21 [Music]
00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentlemen the fully operational mic it's
00:35 all plugged in at least now if it goes
00:39 out I can see it go out those of you
00:42 this cues me you missed the last episode
00:45 I had some technical difficulties okay
00:48 so you guys are always asking me to talk
00:52 about NASA more and more and more boy
00:55 definitely made about it on a daily
00:56 basis pretty much anybody can come over
01:02 the house tonight and we smoked you out
01:04 here three of us and he just told me a
01:10 really interesting story just met a
01:12 twenty-year-old
01:13 fresh graduate from aerospace industry
01:17 the brilliant mathematician kid which is
01:22 always exciting
01:23 he just to give this kid credit before
01:27 we cast aspersions on some of his
01:30 indoctrination which is kind of what
01:33 this one is gonna be a bomb my buddy
01:37 said you know this kid was so bright and
01:38 so cool and so just educated and had
01:42 really good perspective of the world as
01:44 a whole that he said you know it finally
01:46 gave him hope you know the next
01:48 generation may not be as bad as were
01:52 concerned about but there's not enough
01:55 of him my opinion but he I guess
01:58 mentioned the moon landings to this 28
02:01 year old fresh graduate isn't there's no
02:05 question how brilliant this kid must be
02:08 mathematically within math is where
02:16 Jesuits play let's just say that much
02:19 rate he tells my buddy but everybody
02:23 goes we think about the moon missions
02:25 yeah he just goes we want to know and he
02:27 goes why he goes my buddy says well I'm
02:29 80% convinced that we didn't go and then
02:33 he laughs and he supposedly so sometimes
02:36 is effective well we don't
02:38 we don't talk to people like you yeah
02:41 he's kind of joking but perhaps in a
02:43 more precursor setting he would
02:47 seriously not talk to someone like that
02:49 and kind of funny he chose those words
02:51 because whoever gave him that saying is
02:55 trying to keep him from learning how
02:57 full of [ __ ] he is it's just funny I
03:02 mean because if you're a hardcore
03:06 listener this show you know we beat that
03:09 thing up at a microscopic level from
03:12 second to second each stage of the
03:14 mission each assertion of a science and
03:17 there's gonna be a lot of repeat here
03:18 because you guys can't seem to get
03:21 enough but it's I want to come at this
03:25 from a perspective because we have a
03:27 couple things going here we have a
03:28 president United States who often refers
03:34 to the fact that we went and probably he
03:37 thinks we did you know he's a real
03:41 estate guy not a science guy but even if
03:44 he were told that we didn't I seriously
03:46 doubt he would ever change his tune
03:48 because I think this whole thing is a
03:53 it's perceived as a sort of an
03:57 inspirational platform for the people
04:00 the problem is every single decade that
04:03 goes by every century that goes by that
04:05 this lie is out there I guess their hope
04:07 is that they're going to terraform the
04:09 surface of the Moon such that the four
04:12 missions that reused one set twice will
04:15 suddenly exist up there the way that
04:17 they said it will never be the same they
04:20 just won't let make some stupid excuse
04:23 the lack of storms eroded the mountains
04:27 or something right but I think it's also
04:30 been up until recently until NASA put
04:33 itself on sale like a cheap [ __ ] giving
04:36 it you know the victory lap to China to
04:40 Israel kind of they crashed but then
04:43 supposedly it didn't crash and they got
04:44 a couple hours over the footage it's
04:45 just funny how this works right India
04:47 did it
04:48 Russia supposed to under the dark side
04:51 just just you know they're all in it to
04:54 win it by lying without aggressively
04:58 going after the technology that would
05:00 actually get us there but this kid says
05:02 to my friend the most hysterically
05:05 laughable uneducated
05:08 statement in my opinion which kind of
05:11 it's one of those situations were
05:13 there's the old saying that you know
05:15 it's best to keep your mouth shut
05:17 then to open your mouth and remove all
05:20 doubt that you are full of [ __ ]
05:22 right just stay quiet if you're full of
05:24 [ __ ] just stay quiet and you can look
05:26 really smart and boy I know a ton of
05:27 people who have been promoted escalated
05:30 right up to their ceiling by being quiet
05:33 so the whole Peter Sellers being their
05:35 algorithm which I think was a movie that
05:45 was a joke about Einstein he says Oh
05:53 getting to the moon of what today's
05:55 technology is so easy the level of you
06:06 know it's funny you're when you're a
06:07 mathematician you were supposed to be
06:09 although this has nothing to do with it
06:11 I was really good at math and it
06:13 literally there's two different
06:14 hemispheres of thinking right math is
06:17 supposed to make you think logically as
06:20 you're reducing a formula you know
06:23 you've got an equal sign in the middle
06:24 and you got a bunch of [ __ ] on there
06:26 right and a bunch of [ __ ] on the left
06:27 and you're supposed to simplify the
06:28 equation down the point we got equals MC
06:30 squared kind of stuff right he's 28
06:36 years old he's feeling good about
06:38 himself no one should ever take that
06:40 away from him necessarily but we can
06:43 observe and say whatever the [ __ ] we
06:45 want on their show right and a big part
06:47 of it is a kid it's been 50 years since
06:53 we have 48 years technically since we
06:56 last went to the moon if it's so goddamn
06:59 easy to go
07:00 why the [ __ ] are we there huh why are we
07:03 there make me
07:05 scuse quick why they're supposedly what
07:08 three functional Rovers on Mars and not
07:10 a single one on the moon why is that do
07:14 you think logically do you think
07:16 logically really you're gonna test out
07:18 this new platform on your destination
07:22 instead of the closest object in space
07:24 we could possibly put it out there you
07:26 know there's there's I'm gonna give you
07:30 I'll say 90/10 split about why we should
07:34 have sent those Rovers that we ended up
07:35 sending to Mars to the moon first well
07:39 90% reason is you got it you got tested
07:43 in your backyard first you build a brand
07:46 new vehicle it's never been built runs
07:48 on potato salad or whatever it is well
07:50 I'm pretty sure you're gonna drive it up
07:52 and down your street first and then
07:53 maybe around your town second and maybe
07:56 to the next town third around the state
07:58 forth and then maybe across the United
08:04 States just just you know throw a Hail
08:06 Mary so your fifth thing is you're gonna
08:08 go completely across whatever country
08:09 you're in you're in Europe they're gonna
08:11 go all the way from from you know Norway
08:15 to Italy back down the tip of the boom
08:18 yeah you got some problems
08:19 get some mother for unforeseen things
08:21 that's great you know crap out in
08:23 Germany maybe the guy right you know
08:24 what happen was a flim-flam didn't Vic
08:27 with the D do and you know whatever so
08:31 any any regiment of military invention
08:37 always has tests go look up the average
08:41 test platform of Boeing today it's a
08:45 bunch of simulations inside the computer
08:47 to make sure the aerodynamics inside the
08:49 computers say that this thing can fly
08:51 remember the 747 over 165 attempts
08:56 before the goddamn thing took off the
08:58 ground Apollo 11 I should say ten and
09:02 eight went to the moon Circle came back
09:05 he may have no problem dude no problem
09:08 yeah and sensing all the way to Mars
09:11 which is really far away people
09:16 we can see the moon you can't see Mars
09:21 Wow so that's the 90% reason to test
09:25 your platform test the rocket now again
09:29 it's not gonna be identical to the
09:30 rockets you're gonna need to get to Mars
09:32 but hey if it's so [ __ ] easy let's do
09:35 it we were sending satellites to Mars
09:38 under a billion dollars that's when we
09:40 had the big accident in 98 right well
09:41 it's a it's a billion dollars what's
09:43 nothing what is Air Force One and Air
09:47 Force two are gonna costs four billion
09:49 dollars combined two planes are gonna
09:51 cost two billion apiece
09:53 that's a airplane I'm pretty sure we can
09:57 get to the moon if it's so easy that's
10:00 [ __ ] man
10:01 NASA almost never fails unless they know
10:03 the pictures ready and they have a
10:05 metric Imperial comparison issue which
10:08 we're going to loop back on because
10:09 that's the stupidest story ever
10:12 but since society is so scientifically
10:15 ignorant they could pass at any excuse
10:17 um but the double-a batteries we're in
10:19 backwards that's why I crashed in 98 oh
10:21 really man it happens to me all the time
10:24 but what's the other 10% reason ah
10:27 that's great reason it's an easy reason
10:30 you lay down those probes or whatever
10:35 Rovers right inside the Sea of
10:38 Tranquility I mean it's pretty damn
10:40 flattened that's why they caught the Sea
10:42 of Tranquility sort of like a Utah salt
10:45 flat as far as where we understand as
10:47 far as science tells us okay so you land
10:51 safely no craters I'm gonna prom
10:53 get the whole thing out it's going to
10:56 drive around it's cool man it's gonna
10:57 drive around I don't look like the
10:58 Japanese dirt photos uh you know but if
11:03 it's if it's truly we've been there
11:06 before she look exactly the same that's
11:08 all the other [ __ ] we took right except
11:10 now we're gonna have eight K cameras
11:12 we're gonna have live streams pretty
11:15 much right it's gonna take a while to
11:17 get a signal from there but not too much
11:18 couple seconds the cool technology we
11:22 have today black fiber on earth really
11:24 fast transmission but guess what we're
11:26 going to do we're going to drive those
11:28 Rover
11:29 straight to the other sites oh my god
11:32 Lunar Module kickstand the United States
11:35 flag at least 462 air 15 16 17 you have
11:40 three rovers up there I'd have a bag of
11:44 poop up there from one astronauts I mean
11:46 wow
11:47 these dudes supposedly wrote their names
11:49 and their friends names and the and the
11:51 dust
11:51 well damn near should probably still be
11:53 there because there's no storms up there
11:55 no atmosphere how could there be you
11:58 know the funny thing was last time they
12:02 sent something to Mars they accidentally
12:06 admitted maybe we didn't go to the moon
12:11 just recently they talked about the fact
12:15 that the stuff that they're landing on
12:17 when they landed this big Rover right
12:19 they said that is this big of an object
12:21 as we can safely land on Mars until we
12:24 come up with a completely different
12:26 methodology to land on Mars and why is
12:28 that because they claim they can't slow
12:32 down a vehicle with the super thin
12:34 atmosphere that they have if they make
12:36 it any heavier it's gonna hit the ground
12:38 and it's gonna destroy itself oh that's
12:42 weird
12:43 because I think the lunar module was
12:46 pretty freakin heavy especially in 15 16
12:49 17 was a 700-pound moon buggy in it I
12:55 was in a room with a friend of mine I
12:58 turned to her and I was like did you
12:59 hear that and she just looks at me she
13:00 goes oh my god I said you heard it right
13:03 they can't go to the moon they never
13:05 have been in the moon because they can't
13:07 slow the lunar lander down there's not
13:10 enough atmosphere 10,000 pound thrust
13:13 motor oh man he could do that but they
13:18 just indoctrinated this kid how
13:21 masterful have they crafted the schools
13:24 so this kid feels one superior for being
13:27 an abject [ __ ] [ __ ] when it comes to
13:29 the technologies getting into what he's
13:30 thing is is the mathematics right well
13:33 if you're not going anywhere for real
13:35 who gives a [ __ ] if your math works or
13:37 not who cares
13:39 yeah then algorithm hey you got the
13:41 algorithm right but you know what that
13:42 algorithm actually doesn't work great
13:44 because slingshot theory
13:45 needs a lot of fuel when you're going
13:47 the opposite direction
13:48 slingshot theory when you're being
13:50 caught by a big planet well you could
13:53 you could technically theorize it only
13:55 any fuel for that because the planet's
13:56 gonna be slowing you down slowing you
13:57 down Sloane yeah and that elliptical is
13:59 gonna get smaller and smaller smarter
14:01 but for the one that when you need to
14:03 leave you know when you see these SpaceX
14:08 but we should start going you fake X
14:11 rate so fake x flights go up and what's
14:14 the famous shot they have it's like they
14:16 have a one dimensional mind they just
14:18 film that thruster in the back it's all
14:19 glowing red hot right all these [ __ ]
14:22 kids yelling and screaming probably
14:25 every other one an actor right this just
14:29 seems so fake do you know when you see a
14:31 bad made-for-tv you know Saturday
14:34 afternoon matinee when you were a kid
14:37 with their training don't do drugs do
14:39 you know it's like because the acting is
14:40 so bad you want to just drop a whole you
14:42 know eight ball just to counteract about
14:45 acting you see on TV right these people
14:49 fakes
14:50 oh my god they're so like I'm convincing
14:55 to myself but I'm 18 years old so you
14:58 know it's like a 35 year old field is
15:00 going really you really think you're a
15:03 great actor because that was horrible
15:04 you know but they film that that rocket
15:08 in the back okay that rocket is probably
15:12 I don't know four million times smaller
15:15 than the earth right based on another
15:18 calculation I think was three and a half
15:19 billion excuse me the earth was
15:22 three-and-a-half billion times bigger
15:23 than the lunar lander and the service
15:24 module together but somehow it goes I'm
15:26 out of here you're just gonna have to
15:27 keep all your gravity to yourself well
15:30 if you're going to increase in
15:31 elliptical orbit into a slingshot it's
15:36 going to take several rotations around
15:38 the earth you're gonna have to introduce
15:40 force all right well you're already kind
15:44 of beyond the atmosphere so your little
15:46 Rockets gonna work right
15:47 like she's get there and push on your
15:49 chest until you end up in Mars right
15:51 behind
15:52 let's just say we're gonna go with the
15:54 sci-fi definition of all the stuff
15:55 you're cramming through the Van Allen
15:57 belts - so we have to really insulate
15:58 the crap out of your vehicle it's just
16:02 gonna gonna vaporize my god the outer
16:04 valence of all that stuff eating's
16:06 conductive on the outside of any one of
16:07 the satellites that goes through the Van
16:09 Allen belts it's gonna load up with
16:11 electrons it's gonna get massive
16:14 friction and it's gonna pop it's gonna
16:16 vaporize it's gonna really be careful
16:18 what are you gonna ground it to don't
16:22 even talk about it they don't even talk
16:23 about this it's being an issue
16:25 hilarious men I don't say they got some
16:28 figured out but you have to introduce
16:30 force to push away from the earth to get
16:35 that orbit to be a little bit bigger
16:37 then you could temporary clutch your
16:40 engine if you wanted to and just use the
16:42 Earth's gravitational force to pull
16:45 you're on the back side then you're
16:47 gonna introduce force again to get it
16:48 bigger to get it bigger this idea that
16:51 the slingshots introducing infinite
16:53 force was absolutely absurd that means
16:57 the only thing you would have to do to
16:59 get something to fly away from something
17:01 is just kind of throw rockin somebody's
17:03 head and it's gonna go whoa whoa whoa
17:05 and the food's gonna fly off right
17:09 you've seen a bug do it
17:11 he's got little wings right he's
17:14 introducing force the whole time he's
17:15 doing his thing let's talk about
17:19 mathematics for one second here you know
17:22 on the show I everyone so I mentioned
17:23 you know the reports coming out that we
17:25 have other dimensions of existence and
17:28 people are thinking about those is kind
17:29 of alternate realities all layered on
17:31 top of itself right there's ten
17:32 dimensions of reality okay well you have
17:37 five senses therefore you have five
17:40 dimensions of reality - every one of
17:43 your senses if that's the only sense
17:45 that you have would be your perception
17:47 of reality so you have a five
17:51 dimensional reality right now without
17:53 any of the supernatural capabilities you
17:55 can't see ghosts can't see dead people
17:56 who all those different things you know
17:58 five dimensions you can introduce that
18:00 into mathematics and split it all up
18:03 site you
18:05 yes right hearing our sound where too
18:09 many S's in their will
18:11 H for hearing T for touch right split it
18:16 all out and then you could just perceive
18:18 in a line graph all the things that you
18:21 can sense okay well you can imagine how
18:25 you could toy with each one of those
18:26 little perceptions to introduce an
18:29 assertion of what the perception is
18:30 capable of doing we can hear someone
18:33 walking into the room because a little
18:35 bit the ambient noise shuts off and our
18:37 brain is so smart because of survival
18:39 reasons let's say someone's in the room
18:42 you can just hear that little negative
18:43 patch of sound even if someone just
18:45 walks by a doorway and there's music
18:47 outside you're taking in the music it's
18:49 bouncing through the doorway if someone
18:51 just walks by your doorway even a dog
18:53 walks by you can sense that like a
18:56 pressure that like sound and it's my
19:00 girlfriend whatever great gravity is the
19:04 way I always go for because gravity is
19:05 so misrepresented and I think Tesla had
19:11 a big role in scaring the scientific
19:16 community in that when they figured out
19:19 that selling oil was really a powerful
19:22 way to do it because really before
19:23 selling oil we didn't really have
19:25 massive energy control right there
19:27 wasn't a big cartel of people selling
19:31 you know gasoline or something there
19:34 were some gold coins they were
19:35 manipulating Wars and creating needs and
19:38 that way of which they would create this
19:40 fake money to pay off soldiers and they
19:41 would control countries all this other
19:43 kind of stuff but as soon as a Standard
19:45 Oil Company from the Rockefellers back
19:46 buy the raw child started selling oil
19:50 they realized mega power was available
19:53 get everyone dependent on the stuff they
19:55 were inventing the industries that
19:56 needed to use this stuff coal obviously
19:59 got in with the Train situation that
20:02 became very popular as well but when
20:06 Tesla proved that you could pull ether
20:08 all energy out of the atmosphere and
20:12 minut amounts put it through a testicle
20:14 down into the earth into an aqua ravine
20:18 and siphon out of the center of the
20:19 earth infinite plies mother goes to
20:21 another Tesla coil get amplified they
20:24 getting translated into a harmless wave
20:26 of energy that then your device could
20:29 harvest and turn right back into
20:31 amperage and voltage boom they were
20:34 terrifying the whole thing was like oh
20:37 my god the count easy it was for him to
20:41 do that and I'm sure he had little tiny
20:42 ones he could show him right there's
20:44 videos of guys using salad bowls made of
20:47 copper humming from their trees bringing
20:50 wires down hooking it to a little motor
20:53 attached to a 2x4 I thought what a motor
20:57 was so juiced up just from the ball
21:00 hanging in there in their tree they
21:02 tried to stop it with the pan try to
21:04 stop little sprocket with a and I was
21:06 tearing her finger party like oh my god
21:08 I came stop this thing it's that easy
21:11 and so they had to wipe out things like
21:15 ether to explain all things gravity okay
21:20 it wasn't a Galileo though they didn't
21:23 get up on the shower Pisa takes the two
21:27 balls ones big one small and he wanted
21:30 to see if big one would fall faster than
21:32 this moment or vice versa now
21:36 technically speaking at a you know few
21:39 million frames per second the big one
21:41 does land a little bit quicker than the
21:43 small but to the naked eye they hit the
21:45 same exact time okay he then theorized
21:52 this invisible force that had been
21:55 rumored been talked about from Isaac
21:58 Newton days of saying he was leaning up
22:00 the leaning against the tree postulating
22:03 new theories occasioned by the fall of
22:05 an Apple did not hit him on the head but
22:08 just watching apples fall on an apple
22:10 orchard reinforced what was going on you
22:13 know you kind of figured it out well
22:14 galileo takes it to the next level they
22:18 create algorithms around gravity finding
22:20 terminal velocity and all kinds of other
22:22 things but the GZA would succumb in and
22:25 said hey you talking to my gravity is
22:28 going to a lot of people to have more
22:30 power over us
22:31 well we need to mess with that they
22:33 can't stay the same today's we're gonna
22:36 do your algorithm has G's everywhere for
22:38 gravity at least G's on one side of the
22:40 equals sign a bunch of math on the other
22:42 side the weight of the objects how high
22:45 they're falling how long they fallen
22:46 right see if they hit their terminal
22:48 velocity really stabilize their
22:49 acceleration rate okay now they take the
22:54 G and the Tanner turn it into an A and
22:57 they see this is a religious world we
23:00 are the religious gods of this world we
23:02 have invented all religions therefore
23:04 all control and you must make everything
23:07 come back to religion so no more
23:11 publishing algorithms without our
23:13 without our approval and that a stands
23:16 for Angel power angels push everything
23:19 down to the earth Galileo is gonna be
23:23 like okay well that still has my
23:26 algorithm on the other side of the equal
23:28 sign still works the way they're not yet
23:30 but it still comes back to God now comes
23:33 back into those churches and we control
23:35 those churches so we can now threaten
23:40 the behavior of angels against the
23:42 people if they don't behave the angels
23:44 won't serve them gravity won't work well
23:46 and all these Mills the role water and
23:49 generate power to grind up grain or
23:52 whatever you want to do not gonna work
23:54 right what's interesting is that is a
23:58 fictitious story I made up about
24:01 changing it from a g2 an a but the
24:02 second you think about it for two
24:04 seconds if there was truly a threat by
24:07 the concept of gravity against the most
24:10 powerful that little trick would have
24:13 worked
24:14 and believe me you spent a few years
24:17 thinking about it boy they could just
24:19 start creating all kinds of other weird
24:20 interpretations of how things move they
24:23 can take it nah melis and say it's
24:25 because you've angered the Angels
24:27 because you're simple you better come to
24:30 church and pay your 10% and you better
24:33 confess so we know all the [ __ ] you're
24:35 doing right confession confession is
24:38 actually pretty good for your soul I
24:39 think just to get [ __ ] off your chest
24:41 but
24:42 it also allows them to know everything's
24:44 going on you know it's a whole way of
24:46 like imagine all these preachers that
24:47 were sitting there in the confession
24:49 booths which is not something that's
24:50 ever been written in the Bible something
24:51 they invented right and you know the
24:54 preacher's kid McInally yeah he's
24:55 banging that chicks with his buddies
24:57 best his best buddy's wife that that
25:01 dudes fingering the little kids well who
25:02 doesn't hahahah highfive both on the
25:04 Catholic a part of me once this sort of
25:08 assert that that NASA is sort of a
25:10 weapon it's definitely disinformation
25:14 campaign JPL is sort of the unsung
25:20 enabler if not the most powerful element
25:23 of the entire equation now let's look at
25:27 it from the economic realm and then
25:32 we'll go to the socialistic realm of it
25:33 I don't know how many people NASA
25:36 employees but it's got to be over a
25:37 hundred thousand people I don't know how
25:40 many people JPL employs but it's got to
25:43 be tens of thousands of people well
25:47 we're pretty familiar with job reports
25:49 we're pretty familiar with the fact that
25:51 the regardless of their actual
25:55 accomplishments they do you know employ
25:58 the people with the highest degrees of
26:00 indoctrinated information somehow these
26:04 kids get their degrees PhDs even with no
26:06 logic in their brain how many people the
26:09 phd's actually believe the Big Bang
26:11 happened once you pull your head out of
26:14 your ass they get through you wonder how
26:17 anyone got a degree and it's because
26:20 you're only being rewarded for
26:21 indoctrination tell me how dr. need you
26:24 are what your thesis is about what's
26:26 about that level of indoctrination that
26:28 category of indoctrination well we
26:29 approve your your application for your
26:32 doctoral thesis go ahead and go ahead go
26:34 oh you come in with some lucid [ __ ]
26:36 they're like oh god what is this this
26:38 doesn't this is nothing that we taught
26:39 you you're now out of the box
26:41 we don't allow out of the box in fact
26:43 you fail you know show us how you can
26:47 put a mask on put a noose around your
26:51 neck be one of our subs
26:54 and will reward you everybody it
26:56 reinforced both mentally and financially
26:58 I don't think the white house would ever
27:02 want a report that say 250,000 people
27:04 lost a job because we expose NASA and
27:07 GPO and just think about all the
27:09 consulting firms probably millions of
27:10 people related to consulting firms went
27:13 on every single bit of it's inaccurate
27:15 not every single bit of it is useless
27:17 just space travel more talking out of
27:21 you know Earth's gravitational force or
27:26 bird stuff I mean I can totally get
27:28 behind low orbit stuff the kid did talk
27:31 about and not even know if this was even
27:35 remotely true he was worried about space
27:39 debris he did admit this to my friend he
27:42 says so he tells my friend and I don't I
27:45 don't know how this is even possible he
27:47 goes again you have to introduce force
27:51 to get things to go a certain speed he's
27:55 trying to tell my buddy that there are
27:56 nuts and bolts from previous missions
27:59 that are going around the earth up to
28:03 300,000 miles an hour if they can go
28:06 around the Earth's entire circumference
28:09 in a few minutes I have never heard such
28:12 a story in my life
28:13 but Jesus Christ don't we have a space
28:16 station up there supposedly let's just
28:18 go with the theory right well my friend
28:21 says he saw it go by on the desert said
28:24 it was bigger much bigger than he
28:25 thought and very very bright what if
28:31 when you're supposed to see the space
28:32 station all they do is they fly some
28:34 sort of project Dewar sr-71 kind of
28:38 thing and they have the holographic
28:39 technology that we know that they have
28:41 where they basically burn air with
28:44 lasers right there's a bunch of lasers
28:46 converging you get a grid of it super
28:48 dense veins and make it look like a
28:50 space station and then you fly it lower
28:53 than you need to and it's quiet anyway
28:56 so zips across you took a picture of it
28:59 you like taking a picture of some low
29:01 altitude thing looks exactly like it's
29:04 supposed to look
29:07 but what about the movie gravity with
29:09 Sandra Bullock okay so this bolts coming
29:14 around at 300,000 miles an hour what's
29:16 gonna happen if it hits anything it is
29:19 going to be the movie gravity it's gonna
29:22 rip that space station a new one and
29:25 given that it actually supposed to be
29:27 moving you know left to right in orbit
29:29 and its longest form well here comes
29:32 this bullet and it just rips all the way
29:34 down the center of that fuselage just
29:36 ripping human beings apart I mean if you
29:38 ever seen a ceramic tile coming out of a
29:41 real gun it's a piece of ceramic about
29:45 the size of a hockey puck and when shot
29:48 of a rail gun it goes through a 10-foot
29:50 thick wall of lead like like butter and
29:55 the projectile is pretty much intact on
29:57 the other side it's just nuts speed is
30:00 an amazing thing let's look at the
30:03 social element of this whole thing I've
30:07 talked about it before your present
30:11 United States and they take you in the
30:13 first three days when they're telling
30:14 you all the stuff that you didn't know
30:15 and let's just say the moon missions is
30:19 part of the debriefing maybe it's a
30:22 whole day when I say okay here's the
30:25 deal president we tried to go but we
30:30 couldn't go but you know how it worked
30:32 out we bankrupt Russia and even though
30:35 they had boosters it were probably 6 to
30:37 10 times more powerful than her f1
30:39 boosters
30:40 that's proven by the 1995 D archiving of
30:45 them out of the siberian warehouse where
30:47 nasa was buying them off russia after
30:49 the coup because they were so broke they
30:51 needed money from whatever they could
30:52 get and then we tested them and we found
30:54 out they were two-and-a-half times
30:55 stronger than our most modern rocket
30:57 engines in 1995 ok
31:01 never forget that they said they
31:03 couldn't exit the orbit of Earth they
31:06 couldn't create enough power to get I
31:09 don't know I had a big explosion just
31:10 that their last hoorah stand some issues
31:13 anyway beyond that but these so they
31:15 just simply mathematically couldn't
31:16 escape Earth's gravitational force von
31:18 Braun said it would have to be much
31:20 bigger than
31:20 five we get away from Earth but hey man
31:24 just forget all that man if it goes
31:26 against your hoorah [ __ ] patriotism
31:28 and your lack of logic well [ __ ] you
31:31 don't to be proved an idiot so let's
31:33 just it's much easier to forget all
31:34 these things were said by the most
31:36 brilliant people in the world on those
31:37 subjects okay we'll just ignore it
31:40 because then I get to keep my [ __ ]
31:42 you know medal of honor right I am man
31:48 we went I am an American we extra men to
31:50 the moon so he told the president
31:52 they're like I know this is a big deal
31:56 you know every time something successful
31:58 happens whether it's real or not
32:01 our country feels better about itself
32:03 and it feels superior to every other
32:05 country it also makes other countries
32:09 feel very inferior to us that's a big
32:12 psychological of age when it comes to
32:14 war economy's negotiating because in a
32:19 way it's basically we have so much
32:21 technology we can do [ __ ] you can't do
32:24 nevermind the Russians claim to have
32:26 been there first and basically
32:29 everything but the moon now Russia tried
32:32 to go to Mars several times I think they
32:34 finally did supposedly put a rover on
32:37 there but I think the game was is that
32:38 they realized we faked it say like hey
32:42 we'll just build a set like there's I
32:43 mean the Viking thing was a joke anyway
32:45 so we'll just build something
32:49 we'll buy all of our equipment from
32:50 America or from Japan whatever we'll
32:52 figure out how to do it
32:54 we'll send Russians over to the best
32:58 colleges in America and just figure out
33:00 how to use all the software you know
33:02 Russian hackers are some of the best in
33:03 the world I mean it's like they're born
33:08 to do it
33:09 they're so good but they say look this
33:12 also truly I mean without lying truly
33:16 inspires kids to get into technologies
33:21 that get this we make them think they're
33:25 doing calculations to get to Mars but
33:28 you know what they're really doing
33:29 they're like this group of kids it's
33:33 like a distributed computer
33:34 piece of software they're actually
33:36 generating algorithms to help us fight
33:38 war or do something completely different
33:41 oh they're helping us which is why they
33:43 get money but they're not doing what
33:46 they think they're gonna do
33:48 maybe if anything they're helping us
33:51 create theoretical products that will
33:55 get us there someday but my other
33:59 question I would have for them or just
34:02 you know as well as postulating things
34:04 is if they ever said okay
34:10 here's the other problem we have mr.
34:12 president we've lied about this for 50
34:15 years we've done simulations about what
34:20 would happen if we admitted it a whole
34:24 bunch of people lose their jobs that's
34:27 bad America would take it on the chin
34:29 for Jesus how many centuries would it
34:33 take for them to say I mean literally
34:36 America would have to change its name
34:37 it's like one of those restaurants where
34:39 you serve a bunch of poisoned food half
34:41 the neighborhood dies you know just go
34:44 back in to get another egg roll no
34:47 you're gonna shut the place down
34:50 probably not make it a restaurant again
34:52 the family that ran the place well
34:55 they're probably gonna have to change
34:57 their names move to another country
34:58 literally just be reassigned whether you
35:02 have to change your industry I hear the
35:04 people you're the people that kill those
35:05 people yeah no thanks that's right I
35:07 know it's just the PB&J but you've got
35:10 away with food okay now as I told you it
35:14 wasn't my initial understanding but
35:18 eventually when I started correlating
35:20 our intercontinental ballistic missiles
35:23 which is really funny I say ICBM to a
35:24 lot of my friends who are my age or even
35:26 older like what's that like how do you
35:29 know what that is is you ever seen the
35:30 movie wargames you know but anyway our
35:33 missile technology blew up right after
35:37 the moon missions were over
35:38 I think the Trident submarine launched
35:41 the first nuclear-tipped missile from a
35:45 torpedo Bay
35:47 I think that footage is in 1975 you see
35:50 that missile come out of the ocean it
35:52 blows off the shell and then all Sun
35:54 it's brilliant and the range is a boom
35:56 and then it's like it's gone baby like
36:00 you know one to four thousand miles an
36:02 hour and it's traveling utterly
36:06 brilliant I mean just unbelievable
36:08 brilliance to get some pot I mean every
36:11 haven't you as a kid you took something
36:12 that floats that you pulled it
36:14 underneath the bathtub water or the pool
36:16 and your leg going it it's a blip and it
36:18 pops out it just goes in all directions
36:19 now imagine taking a tube full of a
36:23 nuclear warhead with a propulsion system
36:26 first shoots out of a submarine whatever
36:29 depth did that can happen it's gonna
36:31 internationally go up but then it's kind
36:33 of pop up and within a split second
36:35 everything's got to happen it's got a
36:36 counterbalance itself as this gigantic
36:39 thrust engine pops up I mean like just
36:43 you never take a bottle rocket and he
36:45 pulls a stick off and you like the head
36:47 by itself and just me that's what I
36:49 would think it would happen unless you
36:51 have utter brilliance which was
36:53 originally thought up in the v2 rocket
36:56 system by von Braun and friends now
37:01 what's also interesting about the kids
37:02 saying we don't talk to people like you
37:05 is that you can build up someone very
37:09 very easily especially from birth right
37:13 kids interested in science he suggested
37:15 in space that's why he is going to an
37:18 aerospace program we know when from the
37:21 second the kids steps on the campus and
37:23 he rolls in this curriculum he's a
37:26 believer right if he didn't believe it
37:30 may be a weird student you coming oh why
37:32 are you going for aerospace well because
37:34 I know we didn't go to the moon and I
37:35 want to go what would that be cool right
37:37 sorry sir you can go become a
37:43 psychologist to somebody or something
37:45 but you're not gonna get an aerospace
37:46 with that attitude Noreen I don't see
37:49 the kool-aid stain around your lips
37:51 right so the kids are believer and of
37:58 course all the
37:59 professors think about this professors
38:02 typically have never had a real job in
38:04 their life or at least more than a
38:06 couple weeks right and they so they go
38:08 back in to hide inside academia which is
38:11 fine depending on what you're teaching
38:13 but an aerospace person mathematician
38:17 whatever sitting there and they're high
38:19 and mighty thing they're like I know
38:21 people outside of the college have
38:23 actually labored through reality and
38:26 started businesses and did [ __ ] I will
38:28 never do so I gotta have something that
38:32 makes me feel as special as I think they
38:34 feel about themselves and that means
38:38 that what I know is boss
38:40 I teach what they use right I had some
38:46 extremely amazing teachers in my
38:48 lifetime in the in the formal academia
38:51 that did go to college for like two and
38:53 a half years but the reason why I never
38:57 finished college was that any other than
39:00 a guy who substituted in my astronomy
39:02 class in college which I got a hundred
39:06 and three points in my final grade never
39:09 took a note okay
39:10 he's my high school knowledge they
39:12 blazed through this class but the
39:14 teacher was sick and had to do something
39:16 for a week and a guy from NASA Ames came
39:18 in and taught us for a week I took notes
39:21 just for my own sake this dude was
39:24 brilliant okay now at the same time I
39:27 was pretty much went to the moon that
39:29 kind of thing and we weren't talking
39:31 about moon stuff we're talking my
39:32 cosmology but he was just brilliant okay
39:35 but a siphon that one dude that guy was
39:37 my teacher probably a hell of a lot
39:38 smarter I am now but he wasn't but I
39:43 would take computer classes this is the
39:44 thing so this your first show just real
39:48 quickly I came to California at 17 18 a
39:52 couple weeks I was 18 I became a
39:54 professional coder because I knew how to
39:56 code were really really well it's been
39:58 my whole teenage time doing everything
40:01 you were doing and should tons of
40:03 program so I had really
40:07 my god you know it became TurboTax today
40:12 we released four copies of that software
40:16 designed drawn and made my own video
40:19 game and sold that what else was
40:23 involved in some groundbreaking database
40:25 stuff before I ever enrolled in college
40:28 at De Anza College same place Steve Jobs
40:32 went for a little while
40:33 I took my acting classes on the Flint
40:36 stage it didn't even know it's where he
40:37 had debuted all the Macs
40:39 okay twice and role in all these
40:44 computer classes and I definitely had
40:47 one teacher who was great the
40:49 fundamentals just you know some
40:52 old-school linkless stuff and just some
40:54 nice algorithms he was very sweet and
40:56 didn't oversell himself but the second
41:01 class I had to take I can't remember the
41:03 hell as other class was called it was
41:05 this kind of foreign guy in there
41:08 supposedly had a business down the
41:10 street he was trying to become a
41:11 full-time professor and he would tell
41:15 the class like ridiculous things there
41:17 were prehistoric [ __ ] and I'm like a
41:21 software engineer all day long releasing
41:25 products that are you know selling in
41:26 hundreds of millions of dollars right so
41:29 I know it works I know it doesn't work I
41:31 know it's real I know it's fake I know
41:33 it's modern though it's old this guy was
41:35 just full of crap and I wasn't the kind
41:37 of kid that just needed to tell the
41:38 teacher he was wrong I can't remember
41:42 what he was going after but he was
41:43 saying some pretty stupid stuff about
41:45 micro computers which he was a mainframe
41:48 er which was an ancient technology about
41:50 time 1992 came around I remember just
41:53 kind of clarifying with the guy he sure
41:55 is what your future's gonna tell the
41:57 students you know because I do software
41:59 all day and exactly in this area that
42:01 you're talking about no matter where I
42:05 went the colleges were 10 years behind
42:09 everybody else I mean 10 years behind
42:11 the real industry straight there was no
42:13 excuse for that
42:14 this was DeAnza College man Apple
42:17 Computer was a block down the street
42:19 I'm using a VAX machine right an old
42:23 mainframe when you wanted to print
42:26 something you had to Senate it was you
42:27 know terminal down the hallway and it
42:29 was just junk just absolute junk this
42:32 fact should have been free hey we're not
42:34 using this it's a 15 years old going to
42:36 have a copy you want the ticker tape
42:38 prayer we got that too so what I learned
42:43 from that experience was the professor's
42:46 that aren't into fundamentals okay
42:48 you have fundamentals it's like
42:50 chemistry mathematics English those are
42:53 fundamentals right reading and writing
42:55 and arithmetic great that is just gonna
42:59 be the way it is there's rules about
43:00 English and unless we let slang and the
43:03 bond --ax infiltrate our language and
43:05 make bad language good there's only one
43:07 way to do it okay
43:10 mathematics is nutmegs what you do with
43:13 it is different a knife is a knife right
43:15 you can cut Tomatoes with a knife or you
43:16 can stab someone in the eye with it
43:18 mathematics it's the same way you can do
43:21 it to do purple truths or you can sit
43:24 there and synthesize a bunch of
43:25 dimensions because you got more letters
43:28 in the alphabet to create more
43:30 assertions about what things do and
43:33 simply because an algorithm works
43:35 doesn't mean it exists in the real world
43:40 again you watch a lot of great movies or
43:43 read a lot of great books and they will
43:44 play with reality all the time the force
43:47 in Star Wars if you were to allow
43:49 mathematicians to take the theory
43:51 asserted in the Star Wars one you know
43:54 it's Lucas we did in the late 90s where
43:57 they was trying to explain the force
44:00 I mean god I [ __ ] that up right anyway
44:02 you can take all his theories and
44:04 convert them into mathematical
44:05 algorithms and as long as we didn't know
44:07 that that was a fictitious movie so
44:09 scientists could have walked in with his
44:10 PhD thesis in Cambridge University in
44:13 1969 saying you know what there's this
44:15 stuff called a force really yeah you
44:18 just don't have it that's why you never
44:20 see it and he just lays out the
44:22 algorithm for it how it works gets into
44:24 your bloodstream and uses you know
44:26 manipulation of ether the universe or
44:28 whatever right but I heard that
44:32 Hadron Collider was built by people that
44:35 are like I don't know 40 to 60 years
44:38 behind in cosmology theory blew my mind
44:42 but three out of the major four
44:45 colliders is looking for big bang [ __ ]
44:47 really really one of them is actually
44:50 looking for sort of anything that's new
44:53 anything that's cool that's cool I
44:55 forgot the name of that Collider but
44:56 it's a bunch of sub colliders as well
44:58 but come on
45:02 state-of-the-art cutting-edge cosmology
45:05 is all going electric which is a nice
45:07 comfortable way to say II through their
45:13 re-examining the entire universe using
45:15 electrical models and now a bunch of
45:18 unexplained phenomenon which are stuck
45:20 in your Wikipedia definitions for things
45:22 like gravity are all the sudden now
45:23 crystal clear
45:25 it makes physical sense we can finally
45:30 use computer simulations to do it all
45:33 not just with the algorithm of how
45:34 gravity behaves but down to the ether
45:37 particle of how it behaves we just need
45:40 to get the quantum computer up if we get
45:43 100 cubed stabilised we can simulate the
45:46 entire universe
45:47 definitely our little quadrant of it and
45:50 for those of you that are like 20 years
45:54 old perhaps listening to this or you
45:56 were 21 this for at least you realize
45:59 that if you live to be 100 years old
46:01 you're gonna see 2100 the year 2100
46:04 gonna be a while be a long-dead unless I
46:09 upload myself somewhere right but maybe
46:15 in your lifetime if this crazy bunch of
46:18 global is still get their way with the
46:20 universe and turning to some absolutely
46:22 1984 [ __ ] you will actually see this
46:26 technology most likely revealed if they
46:30 shut down the Internet and again like
46:32 all these globalist skip their ways and
46:33 you know these [ __ ] man exists like the
46:37 other power play they're doing for the
46:40 world right now it's absurd right
46:43 I don't know if you guys just to break
46:45 for one second a little digression
46:47 because we're sort of on point they have
46:51 now been revealing photographs of slaves
46:54 back in the day wearing these metal
46:58 masks over their mouths which apparently
47:01 when I get read through it was something
47:03 they would do that's punishment to
47:05 anyone who spoke up he won't who thought
47:07 they could kind of tell the Masters what
47:09 to do
47:09 god bless him right but they would put
47:13 this metal mask on your face to prove to
47:16 you you have no voice which
47:19 psychologically must be just
47:21 unbelievable and you couldn't get it to
47:22 remove unless you shut your mouth the
47:24 rest of your stay which usually is the
47:27 rest of your lifespan being a slave you
47:32 want to know why they want you to wear a
47:33 mask because they're doing it again to
47:37 the entire world you have no voice you
47:41 weak minded person that's why I won't
47:46 wear one [ __ ] that what a guy wearing a
47:52 mask be able to tell you about NASA and
47:54 I going to the moon and teach you how
47:55 science really works no because I be
47:59 repressed suppressed right discriminated
48:03 against because how dare free your mind
48:06 go to the next level my question is was
48:13 two different things here one obviously
48:16 this kid is absent of logic he's a big
48:20 paradigm adopter and he defends
48:23 paradigms to his intellects benefits
48:26 right and she know quite frankly
48:29 psychologically if he feels superior to
48:31 someone maybe he does actually end up
48:33 doing something with that god complex
48:35 but in the end it usually means you
48:36 crash your private plane into him
48:38 outside right but what's interesting
48:41 about is like a couple things here when
48:46 someone tells you that gravity has the
48:47 word phenomenon in it but they know
48:50 everything about everything including
48:51 how the universe began we're going to go
48:54 over the Big Bang here real quick
48:55 because the
48:56 and take I can give you on it but I
48:59 think it's just hilarious but you're
49:01 told
49:02 [ __ ] so often and we all swallowed
49:06 it at some point when we were young
49:07 because we don't have any defense
49:08 mechanism we don't have countered
49:11 knowledge to get out what any sense
49:14 right you shouldn't accept someone using
49:18 the word phenomenon which is usually
49:21 synonymous with the ghost citing
49:24 paranormal [ __ ] and science if you have
49:29 to use phenomenon did you find anything
49:32 then you absolutely don't know anything
49:34 about it
49:35 well you may know how behaves but don't
49:38 be talking about how it works
49:40 think about it they tell you that two
49:42 atoms exchange information with each
49:44 other which causes the pull but it's a
49:47 phenomenon how it works well if you have
49:50 phenomenon between these two particles
49:52 talking to each other you don't know
49:54 what the [ __ ] you're talking about and
49:55 you don't know that that's one's
49:56 actually taking place that's not a
49:58 scientific word phenomenon you know what
50:01 that means I don't [ __ ] know that's
50:02 what that means so don't be they'll be
50:05 talking to me about it what you think
50:07 and don't tell me it's easy to get to
50:08 the moon when you got phenomenon between
50:11 you and the moon let's go to the Big
50:14 Bang I was thinking about this today
50:16 after my buddy left my buddies totally
50:19 on board I mean with full protection we
50:21 reviewed the moon for half an hour and
50:22 he was like yeah that's [ __ ] is then
50:24 I'm like yes but this whole thing that
50:30 the universe compressed now that is
50:31 singularity just that theory so just
50:36 sound completely idiotic to you okay
50:40 utterly idiotic to you if this whole
50:44 thing isn't whose infinitely large thing
50:46 is going down to one thing but two if
50:51 you study it they'll tell you that the
50:52 singularity has no mass that's the
50:55 second thing they tell you it is like
50:58 what is wrong with your brain you
51:01 weren't there you didn't see anything
51:03 like this take place you don't even know
51:05 what gravity is but this is the cut this
51:06 is literally the absolute force that
51:08 makes your theory
51:10 the beginning of the universe occur so
51:12 you can't put those two things together
51:13 there's no assertions after the word
51:15 phenomenon we put the dunce cap on you
51:18 we put you in the corner on this do we
51:19 make you suck your thumb and you go come
51:21 back when you can actually talk about it
51:23 like Tesla at through Faraday who didn't
51:25 have the word phenomenon but they could
51:26 explain how the entire universe works
51:28 and then you reinvented it with the word
51:30 phenomenon it's either you're an abject
51:33 [ __ ] or you're manipulating us right
51:36 now the way that I teach you guys that
51:40 the Big Bang could not possibly occur is
51:42 that the universe is chaotic if anything
51:45 went down to a singularity be the most
51:47 perfect thing ever created in the
51:49 universe
51:49 it'd be the most unified thing to ever
51:52 exist it would be perfect and if a
51:55 perfect firework ever blew up those
51:58 little sparkles at far right there's no
52:00 gravity yanking it down right that
52:01 doesn't exist be a perfect star boom the
52:05 left half the universe would be
52:07 identical the right half the universe
52:08 the top half of the University exactly
52:10 the bottom half of the universe you
52:11 wouldn't have life because you wouldn't
52:13 have chaos chaos is a requirement of
52:16 creating life just go ask Stephen
52:19 Wolfram and his all these writings but
52:28 let's rewind one second you compress the
52:34 universe into this infinitely tiny
52:37 little dot and then they tell you the
52:42 next phase and we don't
52:45 scrutinize the logic of it at all in
52:49 fact I didn't start scrutinizing it till
52:51 today it exploded stop right there
52:59 now if the guy's you know you're gonna
53:00 go out with just deal with everything
53:02 you know stop right there it exploded
53:05 yeah of course it did what do you mean
53:08 of course it did why would it it of
53:11 course explode well because he's got an
53:15 explosive stuff in it does it knows it
53:18 you know because we have [ __ ] and go ask
53:20 a chemist about what explodes it's one
53:23 element
53:24 another element may be an element by
53:25 itself will do its own little explosion
53:27 hydrogen is pretty [ __ ] explosive why
53:31 would it explode why would that moment
53:34 at Rooker if you they condensed all
53:37 atomic energy and matter all down into
53:39 one thing does it explode or would it
53:43 just sit there and do nothing
53:45 why wouldn't a black hole explode it's
53:48 kind of the same little tiny version of
53:50 the same thing I mean any explode how
53:52 could a black hole even exist it goes
53:54 down to its own singularity of time all
53:57 right it's got an event horizon and all
53:58 that guys wouldn't the core explode well
54:03 Steve Adobe Hawking said it in one
54:04 sentence of his book your second book so
54:07 got the [ __ ] name of it but because
54:12 black holes baby universes there's no
54:17 reason why would explode what would make
54:19 that explode so you see how we just
54:24 swallow things we swell little
54:26 assertions that have no background no
54:28 scientific explanation may never tell
54:32 you that physics breaks down multiple
54:35 seconds before this so-called explosion
54:38 but they say just trust us trust us we
54:39 weren't there there's no indication this
54:41 ever occurred but just trust us and
54:43 about ten years you're gonna figure out
54:44 that our stupid theory doesn't have
54:46 enough mass to actually account for any
54:50 type of theory of an explosion so very
54:52 dark matter right like just taking a
54:56 camera and taking a picture of space and
54:58 it's just adjusting to pick up one UV
54:59 ray no stupid cloud out as dark matter
55:02 okay
55:05 it blows me away okay is that we've got
55:09 supposedly the beginning of the universe
55:11 all figured out but Jesus Christ how
55:13 many you know airplanes don't work right
55:16 how many Rockets still explode oh yeah
55:19 man's got a full grasp for the whole
55:21 [ __ ] universe yeah we figured out how
55:23 it started but can't figure how to make
55:26 a rock of work every single time SpaceX
55:28 has to go through a dozen you know
55:29 fuselages of rockets blowing up on the
55:32 tarmac before they can figure it out but
55:33 my god the first thing they do is
55:35 something NASA hasn't been able do
55:36 for fifty years which is Landa rocket
55:39 down backwards but no private citizens
55:41 allowed to ever see that occur oh and
55:44 they have this great idea we're gonna
55:45 make it land out in the ocean somebody
55:49 in your family who's been a fighter
55:51 pilot on an aircraft carrier somebody
55:54 you know close by who has done that
55:57 little maneuver landing was an f-15
56:01 right on the belly of an aircraft
56:06 carrier at night with all the human
56:09 faculties and skill sets and they do it
56:12 the raster hook you know pop sometimes
56:14 they missed the raster hook they missed
56:16 the line and they have to punch there as
56:18 soon as they hit the the deck of the
56:20 aircraft here they got a dump the
56:22 Ferraro
56:23 on their engines because if they miss it
56:25 they got to take back off again they let
56:27 it go down they'll just fall off the
56:28 edge of the boat but the raster is so
56:30 strong that it holds a holds the
56:34 aircraft in place extreme difficult
56:39 camera always seems to cut off right
56:42 before these little reverse rockets land
56:45 and let me tell you the idea okay this
56:49 is the biggest bunch of [ __ ] you've
56:50 ever heard in your life
56:52 the idea is that they're able to reuse
56:56 those fuselages or whatever you call the
57:00 rocket bodies right boost your body
57:02 right yeah we got a guy here I think to
57:09 be two welds four fakes
57:13 and I didn't know this until this last
57:16 six months he's a welder for fake eggs
57:21 well they pulled him off the street with
57:24 no welding experience whatsoever and
57:26 sent him to welding class and he became
57:28 a welder for fake axe all right well
57:31 they do launch a rocket everyone as well
57:33 right so I got a friend of mine from
57:38 high school who is a deep-sea welder he
57:41 makes 500 bucks an hour I don't know if
57:43 he doesn't anymore I doubt he does but
57:45 you know it's was super lethal jobs make
57:47 a mistake you're dead okay
57:51 he went to training after training after
57:54 training he had to cut a bead that was
57:57 the best in the world so that these
57:59 underwater pipe lines don't blow up
58:02 great the micro fractures that happen to
58:07 a rocket is unbelievable
58:11 didn't you see the spaceship just fall
58:14 down on its own you know just well the
58:16 one he built just fell over and they
58:18 people don't know it and it fell over
58:19 and he did a fuel test the other day and
58:21 it fell down
58:22 that's how fragile these objects are I'm
58:29 gonna tell you right now there's no way
58:30 in hell no way in hell these these
58:36 rocket bodies are ready to be relaunched
58:39 okay the metal itself loses its
58:43 integrity after a launch and is being
58:45 ripped and torn and the thrust is
58:47 unbelievable so even though you're
58:48 bringing down to the ground
58:50 yeah saving any money that's the
58:52 cheapest part of the whole rocket is
58:54 that body you know it's the most
58:56 expensive [ __ ] the fuel the astronauts
58:59 and life's and the payload it's inside
59:02 all of which goes into space and doesn't
59:04 have to come back down the rest of its
59:06 super cheap comparatively speaking I
59:11 will believe that this really happens
59:14 when I see with my own two eyes not
59:16 through a camera not through some remote
59:19 television but I'm standing there when
59:21 they put those two boosters down to
59:23 Florida which is always behind a nice
59:25 row
59:26 trees right and if you know 3d animation
59:29 you can see a bunch of funky stuff let
59:31 me just tell you okay but what does fake
59:35 acts do fake acts loads up their entire
59:38 facility with a bunch of young kids not
59:40 a bunch of scientists you don't believe
59:43 it you don't get in the door if you
59:45 don't believe it what do you think do
59:47 you think fake acts is the best place on
59:48 planet oh yeah okay that you get in look
59:55 but if there was ever a time in history
59:57 where we can see the idiots of the world
60:01 clumping together to make horrible
60:04 change in the world it is 20 20 20 20
60:10 men people driving around their cars
60:11 wearing masks seriously seriously if you
60:15 want those people stop it what the
60:17 hell's gonna happen to you in your car
60:18 for [ __ ] sake how many times you gotta
60:22 tell us these masks don't do anything
60:23 for a virus the nucleic acid chain which
60:27 can't exist outside the human body is a
60:30 thousand times smaller than the smallest
60:32 hole you can make it a mask gonna keep
60:36 wearing though don't help me out right
60:39 what's interesting for me about why the
60:44 NASA keeps putting out now
60:46 subcontracting companies are putting out
60:47 like fake eggs is that you know okay
60:53 let's just take a relationship between
60:55 you and a loved one now maybe there's a
61:01 microscopic exception to this rule well
61:05 let's just say you look at princess die
61:09 this happened to her Prince Charles
61:11 wants to marry Camilla his mom says
61:14 Camilla isn't royalty you can't marry
61:16 her you gotta marry this other chick he
61:19 is I don't want to marry her he said
61:21 tough [ __ ] do what you're told and he's
61:23 been doing everything he's been told his
61:24 whole life so he does the honorable
61:27 thing for the family marries a woman he
61:29 doesn't like and immediately treats her
61:30 like [ __ ] she's the hottest smartest
61:32 Welles Brian check ever and of course
61:34 she acted immature when she was rejected
61:37 but none of us act otherwise and
61:40 twenties when that kind of thing occurs
61:42 was here happens on baby right
61:44 treat me some respect I just pushed a
61:46 kid out right so eventually Prince's die
61:50 they separate and and the killer in
61:54 Paris of course right so it's an article
61:57 today it was a hint no it was it Henry I
62:02 can't remember one of the son said he
62:04 forgive his forgave his dad for
62:05 something it was that forgiveness for
62:09 right if you start a relationship based
62:13 on lies big ones are small ones where
62:19 does that go eventually usually right
62:23 into the [ __ ] right it's it's a
62:28 borrowed time algorithm every time you
62:31 were to come home what's that you told
62:32 your wife that you're in your national
62:34 physicists yeah you work at Boeing but
62:37 actually what you're doing here
62:38 scrubbing out toilets at the local
62:41 school nothing wrong with that you know
62:43 that's what you do do it with [ __ ]
62:46 pride do it better than anybody else get
62:48 you check them home and live your life
62:49 however you want to live do anyone take
62:51 a crap on you pardon the pun but
62:56 eventually what if the aerospace company
63:00 that the guy says he works for goes out
63:02 of business
63:03 ah we're gonna go to work honey yeah
63:06 you're losing your job oh oh he's gonna
63:09 make up another line well you know what
63:10 happened I got a job with some some
63:12 other company yeah yeah that's the
63:14 ticket
63:15 he tows another lie yeah we're deeper
63:18 but if you tell someone you love them
63:20 but you don't we don't hate them but
63:23 just don't love them well eventually you
63:25 find someone you like and now you're
63:27 like oh let's say you divorce your wife
63:31 hang out with the new girl get married
63:35 at least maybe get legit but we know I
63:39 goes you hang out with the new girl and
63:42 either you light up both of them or you
63:45 get a girl that's going to be the chick
63:47 on the side maybe she likes the spicy
63:50 little thing she likes the hour
63:52 sophistic angle of boy
63:54 using me over his wife I must be
63:56 something else guys do too not picking
64:01 on you ladies but we know where that
64:04 goes it goes downhill okay so see you
64:09 love your country you love your country
64:13 whatever country you're in you think
64:16 there's a systemic lie in your country
64:18 one that can be fixed not a genetic
64:21 mental one like cultural racism right
64:25 okay do you want your country to
64:29 continue or do you want to live through
64:32 the utter demise and end of your country
64:34 I don't know any country big or small
64:39 rich or poor where the citizens would be
64:42 like I want my country to disappear from
64:46 Uganda to Australia to Germany to
64:52 America the candidate water or China
64:55 there's got to be a lot of people in
64:57 China wondering about whether or not the
64:59 CCP is a good thing for them or not but
65:03 if you walked in the door and said would
65:04 you like your country to totally
65:06 disappear and be ruled by say America
65:10 would you like that
65:11 I bet you'd hear a big hell knowing
65:14 whatever they might say a Mandarin right
65:17 all right well my assertion is that to
65:20 the degree that we live a lie we're just
65:24 living on borrowed time
65:26 except this lie is so gigantic that
65:30 you're talking about any of the pride
65:33 and dignity that you've been able to
65:34 manifest out of your country's flag and
65:36 the anthem that you might sing at a
65:38 baseball game will be inverted to your
65:42 utter shame imagine that they find out
65:49 through some other means that this is
65:51 bad and the government didn't come out
65:52 and say it and apologize and and launch
65:55 a new mission to the moon really bring
65:57 out some covert technology say okay we
66:00 didn't go in 16 I will watch this and
66:02 this [ __ ] UFO goes boom right out of
66:04 Central Park and goes straight to the
66:05 moon all on
66:08 you know who's the feed there's there's
66:10 troops for all the public to go up and
66:12 see it and say everybody knows it's real
66:14 if you can't do then then you're just
66:17 gonna be eatin crow and if you have to
66:19 say you're an American any other place
66:20 on planet Earth they're gonna go you're
66:22 honest liars and we can get out of my
66:25 restaurant right now we don't serve your
66:27 kind now if we loop back on our analogy
66:33 of a relationship with a loved one and
66:35 compare it to this perhaps coming-out
66:37 party where America sets the record
66:41 straight
66:42 and there's all kinds of ways of setting
66:45 it straight and up selling something new
66:47 but now you can go to the moon or not
66:50 okay so say that you didn't cheat on
66:53 your spouse with somebody else which is
66:55 a very damning thing to their ego
66:58 thus you might find yourself quickly
67:00 divorced but if you lied about the job
67:06 because you're all kinds of movies have
67:08 done in sitcoms of done in train where
67:11 someone lies about being a part of
67:13 something losing that old Betty Davis
67:14 movie that I mentioned if several
67:17 episodes back and it's made me she's the
67:22 60s or whatever she was an older woman
67:23 she played it she was a woman who was a
67:26 homeless person who lied about lied to
67:29 her daughter in Europe about being very
67:32 rich and wealthy and married to a
67:33 dignitary and stuff and then the movie
67:35 they end up helping her orchestrate that
67:38 fraud for her daughter who comes to
67:40 visitors to save her face ring it's an
67:43 amazing movie but so they set the record
67:47 straight
67:47 it's a previous administration it's a
67:50 previous group of people those people
67:52 aren't even alive anymore
67:53 maybe they got this plan who knows right
67:55 but I think the doubling down saying
67:58 you've gone back to the moon is another
67:59 way of just putting another layer on the
68:01 layer cake of line but if you went to
68:03 your wife and or she caught you right so
68:07 he said oh I saw your husband yeah you
68:08 know he's a janitor now in the high
68:09 school what you know and she confronts
68:12 him and then he he just says honey I
68:16 love you so much
68:17 I
68:19 think you would like me if I only have
68:22 that job at the high school and she
68:25 loves you
68:26 genuine you've been a good person you
68:28 brought the money home you paid the
68:29 bills yeah everything's been normal
68:32 except you lied about what you did no
68:34 she's a normal human being she would
68:36 just go well I'm disappointed that you
68:39 lied to me but you know what
68:41 I understand and you know what you've
68:44 always provided you always been good to
68:45 me treat me like a queen we're able to
68:48 do our vacations the kids have what they
68:49 need that's what you got to do that's
68:52 what you got to do I love you
68:54 boom it's set clear right no more lies
68:59 and now that guy goes to work with a
69:00 huge chest the next day because it's
69:02 like not to lie anymore I gotta go to
69:05 school okay honey kick some ass right
69:08 lucky yeah boom I think America could do
69:13 it I think we cook him out of this again
69:19 create different companies space force
69:21 is a perfect place to take all the
69:23 brainiacs from the other place get them
69:26 all educated on what they've been lying
69:28 about there's all these poor kids like
69:29 this 28 year old thanks we went it
69:32 thinks it's a sense to get to the moon
69:34 haha right my buddy wants to get me with
69:39 this kid that I think I'm being
69:42 potentially a soul crushing experience
69:44 for the kid if he's not ready I don't
69:46 know I'm so I can't tell but let's end
69:51 the episode on the quick little
69:53 interview the Donald Trump jr. day with
69:56 his old man about UFOs yeah in full
70:03 disclosure I haven't seen the entire
70:05 interview but what I saw was a very
70:07 quick very interesting focus and the
70:11 question it started off with him asking
70:16 his father about UFOs in general of
70:19 course she sees it's a father/son thing
70:21 which was priceless men because you
70:24 don't lie to your kids no matter what
70:26 you don't lie to your kids as he's
70:29 looking at son he's smiling and who
70:32 knows if he surprised
70:33 I stabbed the question kind of like he
70:35 did so I'm watching you know and I'm
70:38 thinking initially I heard about the
70:40 rumor him doing this they promoted a
70:42 little bit and I finally saw on Twitter
70:43 I think I saw a two-and-a-half minute
70:46 clip but to my utter shock and awe
70:51 Donald Trump jr. asked the right
70:54 question he said what about Roswell the
71:00 NUC Trump make a face just kind of
71:03 looking off the camera and he's
71:06 definitely some interesting things
71:08 they're a very interesting event Roswell
71:13 is it right I review a little bit of
71:17 Roswell here I've done two episodes on
71:19 it you dig that episode concept go to
71:22 the website deep thoughts radio.com go
71:24 in this search field just eyebrows well
71:26 there's two episodes on it I've
71:30 mentioned it more than two times but I
71:32 have two dedicated episodes - yeah you
71:35 were talking about just a second ago
71:37 admitting we didn't go to the moon which
71:39 is a big double negative and our script
71:42 but if the next thing that's revealed
71:45 listen Roswell was real ah then you
71:49 don't have anyone paying attention to
71:50 the bad news because there was like four
71:52 to buck another news right and if we
71:56 truly did recover a ship or Bob Lazar
71:59 not completely telling a bunch of lives
72:01 then we might have multiple ships
72:03 whether they be previous ships that man
72:05 made we dug them up or truly from outer
72:07 space and you the Roswell seems then
72:13 we're going back to the moon ever going
72:14 to every other planet we're going all
72:15 over the universe because we have this
72:17 ship and its technology we can use who
72:20 knows where it's been again my buddy
72:21 Sydney he passed last year we were
72:24 routinely visited by a very high
72:26 clearance military guy who swore up and
72:30 down and explain things to sit which
72:32 he's not able to re-explain the last
72:34 version of anti-gravity but the dude
72:36 said look we have anti-gravity we've had
72:38 it for decades and we can go anywhere we
72:42 want
72:43 again if we went up if we can just take
72:46 the
72:47 crap to the moon that would stage it all
72:49 to make it look like we were there and
72:51 you could to get in terraform the
72:52 mountains and stuff on how you doing I
72:54 getting caught you know physically we're
72:56 going and moving people to see your ship
72:57 you know you'd see you messing around
72:58 the moon people take super
73:01 high-definition pictures of Luna all day
73:03 long pill maybe some of the sightings
73:06 we've seen on there is what they're
73:07 doing right that'd be hilarious hey
73:09 there you go there's a story
73:11 just don't tell more lies you know the
73:14 Roswell for me but those who've never
73:18 seen this show before I went out to
73:22 prove a theory true that I thought was
73:26 true which was that the government lies
73:28 about UFOs to freak out the competition
73:30 and to give us the fear that they have
73:33 technology that is way above anything
73:36 that we know are they can use to spank
73:38 us if we don't behave right there is two
73:43 avenues of evidence that is for me
73:54 undeniable one this is 1947 is Lee Joon
74:00 so in terms of us having mind control
74:02 technology and MKULTRA stuff developed
74:04 we don't and you can't do it to a whole
74:07 town anyway all these people who
74:09 testified and gave interviews about what
74:13 involvement they had in this whole thing
74:16 so the name escapes me of the because I
74:19 have Raimi's in my mind which is not the
74:22 guy and see how the dude in the
74:23 photograph with Ramey sees the dude that
74:25 picked up the debris he's the dude that
74:28 met the alien that survived from the
74:30 military site then you have the
74:33 pedestrian groups that met the alien
74:37 first got to the site first
74:40 besides the farmer who picked up the
74:42 pieces then you have the townspeople who
74:46 were interviewed they don't sell books
74:48 they don't sell t-shirts they don't have
74:50 a gas station when the UFO on town they
74:52 have nothing to gain some of these
74:57 people are friends with the dude I
74:59 picked up the stuff
75:02 then there's this and they have edited
75:05 this on the internet I swear to god they
75:07 removed a big part of the clip it must
75:10 be buried in some other clip you can't
75:11 find anymore but the dude who met the
75:13 alien you picked up the stuff and took
75:15 it to his buddies to see lessons twelve
75:17 year old kid he became a doctor who
75:21 stills harassed once a year on the
75:23 telephone by some CIA guys saying you
75:25 really didn't see that did you really
75:27 you saw toys right you know it's like
75:29 give me a break great Roswell was a
75:33 weather balloon top secret base was an
75:37 Air Force Base but it was the right
75:40 Patterson Air Force Base to weather
75:44 balloons top secret weather balloons
75:46 these individuals know what a brother
75:48 Berlin looks like they know what it's
75:49 made out of why because they're the ones
75:51 that build that they're the ones that
75:52 deploy it they're the ones that take the
75:54 metrics from it they know exactly what
75:56 every model of every weather blown
75:58 they've ever put in space hi I'm miss
76:00 fear looks like they would not have
76:04 misunderstood what they were looking at
76:06 under any circumstance and yet they saw
76:09 metals and plastics that they don't use
76:11 some of which they don't even know how
76:13 it was made the video that's been edited
76:17 is of this guy he took him back in his
76:19 70s and I'm telling you doesn't have any
76:22 teeth anymore he's old he took him out
76:27 to where the spacecraft had crashed
76:30 which is obviously totally cleaned up
76:32 now and you see him recall his
76:37 conversation telepathy wise with this
76:40 creature is alien and he gets glassy
76:46 eyed and nearly cries on camera and you
76:49 could only see half this interview be
76:52 who gives a [ __ ] part of the interview
76:54 but what he said was two things he said
76:58 the alien was not speaking but I could
77:03 feel what he was thinking and he sent me
77:05 two thoughts and again he gets really
77:08 choked up as he's empathetically living
77:11 the feeling of this beam
77:13 guys not selling [ __ ] he didn't tell a
77:15 story to like 20-30 years later and you
77:17 tried to write a book or something you
77:19 know whatever but this is way beyond the
77:21 book this isn't some promo you know you
77:24 know for his book to be reissued or
77:26 something right again he's old he's
77:29 within five to ten years of his death
77:31 yeah you tend to like lose all your need
77:34 to tell tall tales at that point right
77:36 and I think if he's telling a tall tale
77:39 why would he cry it's all fake story why
77:42 would you cry we're gonna but he says
77:45 that the alien said to him I've totally
77:49 conceded that I'm here now
77:50 and it's a super sad thought it's never
77:53 gonna see his home world again wherever
77:55 the hell that is
77:56 second thing was he goes don't worry no
77:59 one's gonna ever come to get us and
78:02 that's the one that got him he just like
78:05 felt the isolation and depression and
78:08 fear and just you know sadness of this
78:13 creature but that's the dude who was
78:18 told to pick up as much as he could in
78:19 the back of his truck he takes part of
78:24 it to his house I don't know what the
78:25 chronology is I could never figure out
78:27 what he showed it to his kid first it
78:29 showed it to the bridge club that he was
78:30 supposed to be leading that night he
78:32 takes it and wakes his kid up this kid
78:34 comes and pours a bunch of it on the
78:36 floor of the kitchen kids playing with
78:37 all this stuff no the kid said he never
78:39 he just picked it up and looked at he's
78:41 doing experiments with it as a rumor but
78:43 that guy took a piece with him they kept
78:46 a piece that's very very believable
78:49 isn't it right there's a lot of MUFON
78:53 interviews with the son by the way you
78:55 can look up he keeps his story straight
78:58 the whole time but here's the thing that
79:00 dude was supposed to be leading a bridge
79:02 bridge club that night it was funny
79:05 about it for me as I had grandparents
79:09 that did bridge they were born in the
79:13 20s and they had bridge clubs i watch
79:17 bridge played with people in my own town
79:19 you know you divide up into teams
79:20 there's two against two you bid on your
79:24 your hands and you get the other you
79:26 know the game works but you're gonna
79:27 stack of cards and you win and you're
79:31 playing with your friends deck you know
79:32 that kind of thing anyway he doesn't
79:35 show up because he's busy doing this
79:36 thing so this other dude all the
79:39 husband's work at Roswell all the
79:41 husbands are a top secret level all the
79:43 husband's build weather balloons with
79:45 all kinds of sensors on them this stuff
79:48 again if you watch my initial episode I
79:50 got all the words / names for what this
79:54 was asserted to be it was asserted to be
79:56 a weather balloon that was super
79:58 sensitive to see whether or not Russia
80:00 was detonating nuclear bombs because the
80:04 EMF wave would travel through the
80:07 atmosphere and we have specific
80:09 signature and they knew if they were
80:10 testing okay that's believable in terms
80:12 of a piece of technology it was not what
80:15 they found okay but he walks in to this
80:19 British club and this 84 year old guy
80:22 believed that's how old he was was like
80:24 really old okay he's given us story and
80:28 again he's a Sony thing
80:30 he says he came in with his box stuff
80:33 well he's a couple different plastics
80:36 that black plastics a couple different
80:37 metals these little eye beams with
80:40 writing on them embedded in them not toy
80:43 tape from New York which had flowers on
80:46 it but they keep trying to get the son
80:48 to believe he saw tape and they sent in
80:49 the tapings like this is nothing like I
80:51 saw did you see the diagram my dad drew
80:54 down which is all over the internet you
80:56 can see it just go look a broswell I
80:57 being writing and boom you'll see
80:59 exactly a lien writing okay
81:02 supposed to be boss like a purple and
81:04 inside the the otherwise steel looking
81:08 steel right but also had this foil that
81:13 was you know thought to be the part of
81:15 the fuselage of this craft
81:18 no this is light as zigzag paper and
81:21 it's crumbly a zig zag paper which for
81:25 those you don't smoke dope that's baby
81:27 roll cigarettes with super duper thin so
81:31 they could crush it up in their hand and
81:32 let it go and go would back out another
81:35 dude said he took some out shot a gun
81:37 through it
81:38 didn't hurt at all career back to its
81:39 normal shape no dents no nothing there'd
81:43 be a scratch on anything on planet Earth
81:45 right
81:46 he said they'd rummage through he told
81:49 them that they had recovered a flying
81:52 saucer that there are aliens and the
81:54 room didn't shoot itself everybody was
81:57 super excited he said you know what this
82:00 ain't nothing come look at my truck and
82:03 so everyone follows out of the British
82:05 Club and goes out to his shrub man and
82:07 woman look at big giant pieces of the
82:10 stuff tons of it the only thing the guy
82:14 said it was 84 years oh there's some
82:15 black plastic that he goes nowadays I
82:18 can see how we could make that on earth
82:20 pretty easily and some of the metals of
82:22 you know feasible there's all kinds of
82:26 rumors about people that ran away with
82:27 pieces that then became kind of rookie
82:33 metallurgists and they would go around
82:35 the world trying to find what the
82:36 state-of-the-art metal we could make to
82:38 see who match this little piece that
82:39 they have there's a whole story about
82:40 that too so the guy from the bridge game
82:45 he's got an ironclad story I mean terms
82:48 of just simple it was he's not a big
82:51 telltale guy pretty amazing but then you
82:53 have the corner the corner who got the
82:55 phone call from the military soon do you
82:57 have any little caskets for children
83:01 yeah I got a couple and they keep
83:04 drilling him what would you do to a body
83:05 to preserve it we need this information
83:08 now I mean he goes well it depends on
83:11 what your pathologist wants to do with
83:12 the body but cold is usually what you
83:14 want to do just don't overdo that in
83:17 case you want to do something else it'll
83:18 damage the tissue like I don't know it's
83:19 so this is fine boom so some guys gonna
83:22 pick up the caskets see later it's like
83:24 they come and get the caskets they drive
83:25 off now this dude has a military pass to
83:28 the base because he helps anything
83:30 happens on the base is the corner
83:31 locally he drives into the base cuz he's
83:34 a little concerned if something happened
83:37 he caskets with the hell right kids
83:39 aren't on the base unless it's just a
83:40 family member right living on
83:43 residential block internally most of
83:47 them don't live in their own houses
83:48 outside its how the whole base is
83:50 structured he goes to hospital very
83:53 familiar with that where he picks the
83:54 took cadavers your hate walks in the
83:57 front door and a friend of his is a
83:58 nurse comes out of his room and starts
84:01 puking into a trash can and well most of
84:05 us heard that we thought it was because
84:06 the bodies were so gross as two of the
84:09 one was super mangled burned one was
84:11 very badly injured and the guy was dying
84:13 and the third one was completely
84:15 unscathed and she looks over at the dude
84:20 and she says you gotta get out of here
84:21 you don't want to be here right now I
84:23 was like what's wrong she just goes get
84:24 out of here you know we have breakfast
84:26 I'll tell you guys tell me Merkel's
84:28 reluctantly he leaves very soon after
84:31 that they have breakfast I think it's
84:33 like the next day it's like a 50s diner
84:36 course it's 1947 she shows up she hasn't
84:42 slept you could just tell she's
84:44 distraught she eventually slides some
84:48 drawings over to him some hands sort of
84:52 a general anatomy of their body and
84:54 she's looked 'add they that rumor that
84:58 they print in the newspaper that they
85:00 recovered a flying disc what aliens in
85:02 it it's true but I was up doing an
85:05 autopsy with two other doctors in this
85:09 room I was the assistant nurse right she
85:12 said the reason why I was puking is that
85:14 their bodies are full of sulfur and it
85:16 was just making us nauseous everybody
85:18 was taking turns of cooking right so a
85:23 little bit of time goes back you know
85:24 goes by she goes back to work they had
85:27 breakfast again this time it's a much
85:30 shorter breakfast
85:32 I think he said she didn't eat maybe
85:35 even either time but she says look
85:37 here's the deal I'm being transferred
85:39 and here's what's gonna happen she goes
85:42 up I'm gonna send you a letter wherever
85:45 I end up you're not to reply with any of
85:49 this knowledge I want you to send me a
85:51 reply
85:51 this simply is some fun little how you
85:54 doing good to hear that you're safe and
85:56 sound kind of reply don't say anything
85:59 weird he agrees he's a knowledgeable
86:03 dude they said this guy changed his
86:05 story several times which is why is this
86:08 giant liar
86:09 I watched 40 years of this guy's
86:11 testimony and he didn't change at all
86:14 it just didn't even really add any
86:16 embellishments he didn't add more to it
86:17 and remember more it was just perfectly
86:19 repeated so that's a lie
86:23 you know when someone lies about someone
86:25 telling the truth guess who you believe
86:29 so she transfers sure enough she sends a
86:32 letter he sends let her back six months
86:35 ago spires so it doesn't hear from her
86:36 again so he goes to the base and he's
86:40 like hey I have a friend she was a nurse
86:42 here she got transferred just would like
86:43 to know where she went
86:45 he gets told that she was transferred to
86:47 England and she died in an accident with
86:49 four other nurses totaling of death of
86:51 five in his gut feeling he didn't think
86:55 she really died he thought that maybe
86:57 she got erased so she can continue
86:59 pursuing this situation you know the
87:02 fact that she never ever showed back up
87:04 again to his doorstep is a little
87:06 frightening okay the other story that I
87:14 thought was massively credible was this
87:17 old woman I mean old she's in her living
87:21 room she's being interviewed and she
87:24 comes from that simpler time she'd just
87:25 rhyming my grandparents they just didn't
87:27 talk certain ways and they talk to other
87:29 ways and yet remember 1947 if you were a
87:32 ji-hye that government guy you you were
87:36 like the hero just cuz you didn't lie
87:40 and you didn't violate the law you were
87:43 the law you you even forced it your good
87:46 guy
87:47 so when death threats started going out
87:50 against people this was weird she said
87:56 that her best friend worked on the base
87:58 as a receptionist and that she was
88:04 approached the night that they were
88:06 doing those autopsies at the hospital
88:08 this was
88:09 suctions to the hospital yeah he said
88:12 hey come here I'll show you let's see
88:14 something cool
88:14 when he brought it down the hallway said
88:16 don't go inside the room just a hit the
88:18 door jam but I'm gonna show you
88:19 something she does exactly as she stole
88:21 if she stays at the door jam they walk
88:24 to the other corner of the room and
88:25 underneath this blanket was one of the
88:29 aliens I assume it's the one that wasn't
88:31 so mangled they pull it up in the air
88:33 that's an alien this is real ding yeah
88:38 go back to your desk she goes home that
88:40 night and she serves dinner to her
88:41 family your two kids and her husband
88:43 tells them all about it it goes to work
88:45 the next day and they pull her aside and
88:48 say we know what you did you shouldn't
88:50 have done that
88:51 never to tell anyone this story again
88:53 you need to go home and make sure your
88:55 family doesn't tell stories make sure
88:56 your kids don't tell any stories at
88:58 school if you do not follow what we say
89:01 you will die because we will kill you
89:05 within a year she died in a hotel room
89:09 there's a motel room registered to his
89:12 sister's name so they can get in like
89:14 Dorothy Kilgallen death right for the
89:18 random row death it was a it was a
89:20 concoction of prescription drugs and
89:22 alcohol mm-hmm her friend telling the
89:26 story said look she didn't drink she's a
89:30 mother of two there's no reason for her
89:33 to be out in a motel by herself
89:35 she's not the deceitful woman and this
89:37 woman starts choking up because she goes
89:39 I think they killed her and it was hard
89:41 for this woman to conceive that her
89:44 government killed her best friend that's
89:48 the way they were now the guy with the
89:51 bridge story you saw the box of stuff he
89:56 saw the truck of stuff he said he went
89:58 to work the next day he's again the
90:01 highest it gets at the Roswell base he
90:04 said well that box was right there on my
90:06 desk which we have about four of us
90:08 sharing the room and he goes it's right
90:09 there so I went through it again about
90:12 four hours playing with this stuff
90:14 because at noon came and round noon
90:16 between 1:00 and noon black suits suits
90:20 show up
90:22 and say okay sign here 50-year gag order
90:26 you break this you die and they took all
90:29 the stuff with him all right but what
90:33 was the official story the official
90:35 story was a weather balloon and then for
90:36 the good Fort Worth Texas they did that
90:39 famous photo shoot with all the crap on
90:41 the ground with Raimi's with the letter
90:43 that they've now assumed on the letter
90:45 letter talks about a disk being
90:46 recovered in the desert very convincing
90:49 they did an amazing job zooming up on
90:52 this letter and doing character
90:53 recognition of all the letters on that
90:54 on the magnified letter thank god easy
90:58 good camera but we have one more
91:02 testimony that's amazing there's a bunch
91:05 more of people in the town but this
91:07 one's fantastic older guy again he was
91:12 in his seventies it's kind of a dopey
91:14 guy which is good because again you have
91:18 limited intellects you have limited
91:20 ability to tell a lie remember you will
91:22 always believe tend to believe alive a
91:24 person who's more sophisticated than you
91:26 and you'll always sense a lie of someone
91:28 who's less sophisticated it that's why
91:32 George Bush could fool some people and
91:34 couldn't fool others Obama could fool
91:37 some people couldn't fool others now
91:41 this dude said he was on staff that day
91:45 and he was just a lowly guy that did
91:48 shipping maneuvers on you know loading
91:52 up cargo planes and that kind of stuff
91:54 and he was assigned with a few other
91:56 people to pick up the boxes of the
91:58 debris from this crash again they're
92:02 told it's a weather balloon I know
92:04 weather balloon stuff right this is the
92:07 headquarters of other balloon research
92:09 technology we now need to move it
92:12 anywhere because that's the places where
92:13 you would analyze it it's your balloon
92:16 by the way when I read through all the
92:17 reports they said 80% of weather
92:20 balloons are never recovered they didn't
92:21 give a [ __ ] where they go interesting
92:25 but he was picking up these boxes they
92:28 were all nice and wrapped up real nice
92:29 and he was they didn't weigh anything
92:31 and he kind of thought after moving a
92:33 few of these body was this a joke
92:35 he's don't shake him and there's nothing
92:37 in there he was like what's the deal and
92:39 he's moving him into this cargo jet it
92:44 flies to Fort Worth Texas with Rama's
92:46 and the other dude like Henry's name
92:49 they go off inside to do the press
92:53 release or press announcement or
92:55 whatever the famous photograph but the
92:57 guy goes look they didn't take any of
93:00 the stuff with him in taking the boxes
93:01 with them whatever they were showing in
93:04 that room was already in that room the
93:06 minute they walked in the door which is
93:08 like a tinfoil kite basically right so I
93:11 didn't know this but when you're one of
93:13 those kind of soldiers you're shipped
93:15 off with the plane and you fly to a
93:18 different base as soon as you go to the
93:19 base you go to this commander
93:20 the CEO who says to you okay this is
93:23 your assignment his assignment was take
93:25 all the crap that you just put in that
93:26 plane and put it over there this one's
93:29 going to wright-patterson Air Force Base
93:31 which is our skunk works
93:33 it's where the sr-71 was designed is
93:36 supposedly where hangar 18 was which is
93:39 where the saucer remains were sent in a
93:43 different shipment the big 30-foot disc
93:45 I got these series of photographs I
93:48 don't know if this is real enough but
93:49 the photographs are real but what since
93:51 I may or may not be this thing but they
93:53 have a square box that's you know got
93:56 some depth to it
93:57 it was secretly moved across the United
94:01 States and some photos of that I know I
94:04 can't find it trust me
94:07 anyway he moves it all in there and so
94:11 by tiny get back and you heard about
94:12 this press thing which he didn't know
94:14 was going on he didn't have any of this
94:16 stuff
94:17 super duper interesting great
94:21 so when Donald Trump jr. asked his
94:24 father about the one thing it seems the
94:28 most seems to be the most bonafide thing
94:30 the Murray Island thing that happened a
94:32 couple weeks earlier hmm maybe it's in
94:36 my men in black episode I don't know
94:38 that has huge legs Roswell is the
94:45 baddest one in town in terms of a
94:47 sighting
94:49 because it's confirmed by so many people
94:53 all the foil paper people being
94:57 threatened I mean you know their whole
95:00 thing was that it was a weather balloon
95:01 - since Russia's thing okay
95:06 well as long as you recover the guts you
95:08 could be looking directly at that
95:10 satellite whatever the hell that thing
95:12 was right you wouldn't even know what it
95:15 does so it's not like you're gonna be
95:17 able to tell anybody anything if you see
95:20 a flying triangle over your house well
95:22 that's a little bit different it's a
95:24 whole story out there is that a UFO or
95:25 is that something we make ray so maybe
95:29 if we're gonna ever tell the truth about
95:31 NASA and JPL we back it up with
95:35 something incredible like a UFO story
95:38 yeah we distract the public quite a bit
95:41 and we replace a negative with a super
95:43 positive a super negative with a super
95:45 positive
95:47 this kid that my friend met I say kid
95:51 respectively of course respectfully it's
95:56 sort of sad that it's a pure indication
96:01 that dr. nation with the educational
96:03 level is absolute was the last time you
96:06 heard a key get a degree in aerospace
96:09 and then you sit down smoke a cigar with
96:14 them then you know we didn't go to movie
96:15 I really yeah I knew that but like why
96:18 what do you think that why took all the
96:20 classes and I did all the math and I
96:22 questioned everything I thought for
96:25 myself because I have true intelligence
96:29 and logic and nothing makes any sense
96:34 and by the way the kid had an
96:37 explanation a partial explanation just
96:40 fell flat on its face but it was it was
96:42 a new one I'd never heard before
96:44 and just again just this logic just
96:48 missing just unbelievable how this kid
96:51 swallowed just this pill of utter
96:54 [ __ ] right which I need to call in
96:56 the black pill now
96:59 he said that I can't remember why he was
97:05 emphasized he my friend forgot the point
97:06 he was trying to started trying to talk
97:07 about how I am since the earth since the
97:11 moon is so reflective that it was
97:14 contributing to something if I could not
97:16 talk about the stars disappearing which
97:18 would definitely be the case in the
97:19 tight aperture you know but he said that
97:23 the spacesuits worked never dresses the
97:27 oxygen problem never dresses the
97:28 freezing problem at all
97:30 right here's what he said he said that
97:34 the space suits which are 200 and he
97:37 locked it in 240 degrees Fahrenheit I
97:39 don't know what that he's Celsius mr.
97:41 Barratt again a match will light at 320
97:45 to give you an example fahrenheit ways
97:48 but he said the suits were so reflective
97:52 with its white fabric that's what fended
97:57 off the 240 degree temperature I mean
98:01 just think about it just think about it
98:03 my god okay so I guess I can put my hand
98:06 in the oven as long as I got a nice
98:08 white glove on it's never gonna get hot
98:09 and give me a break never address the
98:13 fact that the astronauts back if they
98:15 were facing the Sun would be 240 degrees
98:19 below zero that's the official swing he
98:25 said that the cameras because the
98:27 cameras were um made of pure aluminum or
98:31 so reflected that radiation just lost
98:36 all of its atomic principles it didn't
98:38 go through the device my god my god I
98:43 mean seriously right why would why would
98:45 pilots have to wear a little pin on
98:48 their epaulette to track their amount of
98:49 radiation exposure
98:50 if the fuselage is nice and reflective
98:53 it's never gonna go through goes through
98:55 the window I don't know window is gonna
98:57 have UV protection right never addresses
99:01 all the low-hanging fruit the one thing
99:07 I'll constant reminding still signed by
99:09 half an inch more on this stick is that
99:12 the maneuvers that they
99:13 in space could never have been tested
99:15 unless you actually did it so you have
99:19 no assurance right the the one thing I
99:24 was going to loop back on to was that
99:25 the the 1988 crash on Mars another big
99:31 thing you can just think about first
99:33 split-second you have any logic in your
99:35 brain whatsoever I was I guess blessed
99:39 with a little piece of knowledge because
99:43 my girlfriend back in the early 90s was
99:45 part of the testing team I think for six
99:48 years on the Tomahawk missiles she had
99:52 said that they had tested these things
99:54 in mathematical form for years before
99:57 ever trying to fire the first one the
99:58 first ones don't work they went through
100:00 dozens of before they worked in every
100:02 time I was getting really you know drive
100:04 around and get to where they're going
100:05 right what I heard of the is she was a
100:10 QA person she is at the heart of making
100:13 sure she it works they told us that that
100:17 satellite crashed in 98 because of an
100:22 imperial metric conversion problem
100:25 between a European module and an
100:27 American module all right you know D but
100:31 at NASA asking this question especially
100:33 98 I believe that everything on the
100:38 Saturn 5 and the 60s was all metric
100:40 NASA's been metric forever because they
100:43 love the base-10 system of metric they
100:45 can't blame you it's fantastic for doing
100:48 engineering the United States as of 1990
100:52 1990 was all metric trust me when I
100:57 think the first examples of metric that
100:59 I was taught was for NASA examples so
101:05 one we don't make things in imperial
101:08 measurements at NASA okay
101:10 but even if they did let's just say
101:12 someone looks up some [ __ ] snow
101:15 observable and in it's all alive
101:17 whatever you told what you want to hear
101:18 and see believe it okay I guarantee and
101:22 they were supposedly saving money that
101:24 was the other big excuse ray
101:26 so he'd test things that much apparently
101:29 at all okay because everything that's
101:33 hardware is put all together
101:36 in a clean room okay everyone's like in
101:39 those hazmat clean suits right and it's
101:42 tested and tested and tested they run
101:45 sample missions but even if they don't
101:47 have the hardware available you can
101:50 write software with it emulates hardware
101:53 ok but I guarantee you they would never
101:56 just plug two pieces together with
101:59 completely different measurement systems
102:01 okay it would never occur the game of
102:05 NASA this out of sight out of mind you
102:08 see the fun rocket go up which is
102:10 definitely fun to see as soon as it's
102:12 out of your view headin over the ocean
102:13 but it probably just crashes in the
102:15 ocean whatever with the spatial for
102:21 those of you really want to get into
102:23 like the Challenger thing where it looks
102:27 like a bunch of the astronauts working
102:29 on the ship right like all of them
102:30 except for one guy who may have perished
102:32 before this thing was uncovered one of
102:35 you said you saw and you know one of you
102:37 said you attended a class with one of
102:40 the astronauts who was a teacher in
102:41 Minnesota and you said you're gonna go
102:44 talk to the gun and ever back from the
102:46 guy named I don't know if I still have
102:47 the chat history and Facebook so you owe
102:50 me a reply but we also have basis or
102:56 it's that base that they thought that
102:58 that flight the Malaysian flight to
103:02 disappear they thought it landed at this
103:03 base and so this brave fellow could just
103:06 simply take off and go over there and
103:07 land on the other side of India and I
103:11 kind of the Indonesian area and then
103:14 just hang on to it till the locals some
103:17 [ __ ] story about is just a test one
103:19 whatever and just put it back on a plane
103:23 fly it all the way to work well you need
103:25 to land a thing and then just drop it on
103:27 this guy and I saw it land
103:29 I saw one take off with Sally Ryan her
103:31 maid mission and I saw one land in the
103:33 desert of California and it did sonic
103:38 booms
103:39 just boom boom boom boom you know and
103:41 you look up and the [ __ ] thing is
103:42 flying upside down okay and it does this
103:45 barrel turn go in the opposite direction
103:48 when it lands i watch the whole thing
103:49 happened right
103:50 I did not see there was two f-16 I will
103:55 say there was checks of sixteenths it
103:57 was seem to be escorting it down but it
103:59 flew by itself and I didn't hear any you
104:03 know
104:03 jet engines or anything I don't know
104:05 where they would hide such a thing it
104:07 just seemed to be like a brick falling
104:08 out of sky but something popped booms
104:11 and you know you saw it you just kept
104:13 your eye on the whole thing the whole
104:14 time I didn't want to take my eyes off
104:16 fact I have this weird thing about
104:19 amazing moments I wear glasses as a
104:23 corrective vision thing right never
104:25 pretty lights a prescription but I will
104:27 take my glasses off to see things that
104:30 are amazing
104:31 and I remember he's doing it and just
104:32 watch I have a picture I mean the desert
104:35 but it's a picture game people remember
104:40 Hollywood used to precede NASA and now
104:43 NASA precedes Hollywood good example
104:46 2001 a Space Odyssey kind of research
104:48 and development projects for NASA's moon
104:50 landings and wasn't Kubrick doing the
104:53 the footage as much as people will tell
104:55 you that he was a much better director
104:58 than that he wouldn't have let the
105:00 crappy footage go out the way it did and
105:03 he was in his home when it landed he
105:06 wasn't in America when all the theories
105:08 of these missions being filmed but I've
105:10 got a friend of mine who's just
105:11 hell-bent on that being the truth and no
105:13 matter how much I tell him Kubrick
105:15 wasn't in the country and we confirmed
105:17 this through Vivian's travel log he just
105:21 refuses to believe it was a magical
105:23 plane that took him to America to do all
105:25 this stuff but anyway we have 2010 a
105:31 Space Odyssey releases in 1984 directed
105:34 by Peter Hyams the perfected circular
105:37 spherical projection to do the monoliths
105:41 turning Jupiter into a star and then
105:45 boom the Voyager starts dropping
105:47 pictures of Neptune Uranus all that kind
105:49 of stuff
105:50 [Music]
105:51 believe me I never want to see your anus
105:53 again but something really interesting
105:57 happened when the Sandra Bullock movie
105:58 came out called gravity and I forgot
106:03 what the name of this company was but I
106:05 have you know lots of friends and the
106:07 special effects business one of my
106:08 buddies is we had dogs at the visual
106:12 effects society's a fellow because he's
106:14 one of the first CG dudes on planet
106:15 earth period when the movie gravity
106:20 released its trailer I heard this story
106:25 from the three different studios
106:27 happening simultaneously through the
106:30 same day same event occur special
106:33 effects supervisor comes in the room
106:34 says guys come here come here come here
106:36 watch this
106:37 boom place the trailer to gravity let's
106:41 um watch it of course everyone's blown
106:43 away you just look all that CGI except
106:46 for the face and the hands Sandra
106:48 Bullock's body swimming through that
106:51 space station all CG her whole body the
106:57 dudes who are gods at this rate from
107:01 Maya all the way down a light wave
107:03 geniuses Island people Digital Domain
107:06 people other sub studios I'll ask the
107:11 same question who did it really special
107:14 effects we never heard of this tech and
107:17 they guys some company in Germany did it
107:19 we never heard of ok do a little math
107:24 there right how is it this super duper
107:27 mega state-of-the-art crap is happening
107:29 in the world no one even knows the tech
107:31 exists friends no friends right they
107:35 leaves well within the social media
107:37 realm of the world how could you not
107:39 have a buddy go but you see this year
107:41 we're doing man we got this genius kid
107:43 he's like cranking out [ __ ] you know
107:45 you'd have a rumor going around that
107:46 something big is happening in special
107:48 effects when avatar showed up at 2007
107:53 everyone knew that movie was coming out
107:56 everyone knew the [ __ ] that James
107:58 Cameron was inventing little iPad
108:01 monitors or he had previous inside a
108:03 game engine
108:04 you know he's making two three four and
108:08 five right now four different movies man
108:12 he's got three directors hired right now
108:14 three different I guess in John Landau
108:16 is doing one of them I wish I know know
108:19 what I talked to him so now it's hidden
108:23 in the background I can tell you one
108:25 more story and I'll close up here 2008 I
108:28 was solicited by a mutual friend of mine
108:30 who was a Harvard ph.d grad he wants me
108:35 to consider using his technology in
108:38 video games to simulate what's now
108:42 basically deep fake but it was not deep
108:45 fake as in what we see today where they
108:47 can you know go over someone's face
108:49 which is just phenomenal now blender
108:51 can't et fake now it's amazing but he
108:55 showed me this African tribe dude old
108:58 man all the wrinkles in his face face
109:01 paint makeup on bald and he was talking
109:05 who's Baba Baba Baba I was just photo
109:07 real and I'm kinda looking at this going
109:10 okay is this the demo or is this some
109:12 reference material raises some video
109:14 tape of some guy talking says no that's
109:17 it I'm like okay I've seen everything
109:20 right two years later
109:21 Jeff Bridges looks like [ __ ] and Tron
109:25 Legacy when he's youth down right he's
109:27 looks like crap looks weird it's digital
109:30 domain they know what they're doing
109:32 that's the best they could do look at
109:34 this stuff and I go he shows me this
109:36 Asian girl with little dots on her face
109:38 and she's driving the African guy he has
109:41 tons of examples all photo-real
109:43 megafloat early cuz they only have to
109:44 touch it up a little bit by hand videos
109:46 it some like dude this is this is photo
109:49 real like you could do me I mean baby
109:52 hair doesn't work as well because by the
109:54 guy was bald I don't know so I asked so
110:00 where did this tech come from he's going
110:03 Wow
110:05 the founder who's the coder used to work
110:09 for a little alphabet agency might start
110:12 with see my name with a he says we
110:15 finally got Clarence a couple years ago
110:18 drop this into the public domain you
110:21 know first sale the private sector was
110:24 like oh okay
110:26 right again Hollywood goes technically
110:32 first but no one gets to see it until
110:34 NASA's already used it or other agencies
110:37 to fake people in places where they
110:39 weren't doing things they didn't do
110:42 maybe something happened in Vegas one
110:44 time and maybe just need some believable
110:47 footage hey if it's a blurry camera oh
110:49 my god I can tell you this technology
110:51 mix with the blurry camera plus deep
110:53 fake they could make you a patsy in two
110:56 seconds so I guess the Holy of your
111:00 house you know don't accept invitations
111:03 from random strangers to go to casinos
111:05 okay
111:07 so stuff is very real there's a whole
111:11 ecosystem to it
111:12 if you dig these kind of conversations
111:14 definitely go to the website deep
111:16 thoughts where you're calm and search on
111:17 just click the category field for NASA
111:19 talk and you'll know see it up there if
111:23 you see a bunch of videos talking about
111:24 all this stuff when we get into all the

111:56 welcome to the club man I do tweet a
111:59 little bit mine's calm is the other
112:02 place I really love which is a
112:03 competitor Facebook first when the First
112:06 Amendment protected [ __ ] shoot is the
112:08 other video site with all the videos I
112:11 did retire all the covet vids because I
112:15 just think you know some that stuff's
112:16 expired and sort of a big negative
112:19 stream so if you have the direct link to
112:20 it'll still show but probably will
112:23 retire those within six months from ever
112:25 being accessed again no big deal love
112:28 being lost let's just erase all that
112:29 negativity and we'll cover new stuff
112:32 stuff comes out as you can tell I'm just
112:34 gonna embed it in other episodes but
112:37 there's also a couple ways to donate I
112:39 really want to thank everyone for
112:40 partying with their hard-earned dollars
112:41 and patreon went over a hundred bucks
112:44 we have 150 bucks which is awesome and
112:46 then some of you shot me donations
112:50 through PayPal I did get the handle name
112:52 of the individual this last donation
112:55 last two and get any information just
112:59 got the money so there must be a
113:00 selection to keep yourself completely
113:03 hidden so if that appeals to you know
113:05 it's a way to go to there's a all-new
113:08 remastered season one which is much
113:10 better than the first version and I do
113:13 leave the links out there in case
113:15 someone has an embedded link so you can
113:17 access old episodes I think even
113:21 DuckDuckGo still shows you some of the
113:23 old ones the way you can tell the new
113:25 ones is if you see the thumbnail and I'm
113:27 smoking the stick the end of the amber
113:30 is lit on the thumbnail of the new ones
113:32 and it's it's dead on the the old ones
113:35 just so you know because it was animated
113:37 so we have a store a lot of you bought a
113:40 lot of stuff I really appreciate it I'm
113:43 always full disclosure with you guys the
113:45 revenue that this channel is actually
113:47 generated all arteries I don't know the
113:49 PayPal total but over the course before
113:52 we got D monetized on YouTube over five
113:55 years
113:56 it grossed sixteen hundred bucks just so
113:59 you know case you think I'm rolling in
114:01 it the the T spring or spring t or
114:08 whatever I get those shirts from my take
114:10 on it's been fifty three bucks just so
114:13 you know and I think patreon is up to
114:16 110 hundred eleven dollars or something
114:18 like that that fluctuates from time to
114:20 time so if you go up there and may not
114:21 be the same knows if your credit card
114:24 ever has a problem they remove your
114:25 donation and some people then put it
114:27 back in with a different card or
114:28 whatever but anyway I really appreciate
114:31 all you guys for sticking with the show
114:33 I'm getting very very close to the Tesla
114:35 episode but I probably put one more out
114:37 before that happens depending on my
114:39 timeframe definitely working on some
114:41 pretty cool stuff that you're all gonna
114:43 get to see
114:44 so anyway take care of yourself and
114:46 someone else and I will see you on the
114:48 next NASA episode over now
