00:02 [Music]
00:23 you
00:24 [Music]
00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts on this
00:36 rather know indecisive day of wind enos
00:48 you don't notice these kind of things
00:50 until you make a show like this but
00:51 you'll you'll walk out and you know it's
00:54 all still and I'm setting all the
00:56 equipment up and then sort of God
00:58 ten minutes later it's like oh we
01:01 decided to be a windy day so today I'm
01:03 setting up and I you know I feel like
01:05 four or five different ideas about what
01:07 the show could be and I just you know
01:11 sometimes I rush out and it's I got an
01:13 agenda I'm going to do this show just
01:15 did the moon evidence show in the garage
01:17 yesterday and so that was just very
01:22 intentional you know today is one of
01:25 those days or I'm setting up but I'm not
01:26 quite sure I'm gonna do I haven't
01:32 touched dreams in a while and you know
01:37 the only reason why I hesitate on that
01:39 is that I usually have to have some
01:41 substantial improvements or additions to
01:46 my understanding of dreams before I'll
01:49 talk to you guys for one hour about it
01:50 right and so I've got this interesting
01:54 situation in my own life and I I hinted
01:57 at it or tried to describe it in the
01:59 previous episode I have no idea which
02:00 one I don't even know if it was this
02:03 season but what I want to call this
02:07 particular episode it's something
02:11 related to the act of grasping reality
02:16 because I don't think that we actually
02:19 consciously think about the fact that
02:20 when we wake up we just accept what
02:22 we're processing as our limitations
02:26 right what is the reality besides just
02:30 the paradigm of limitations right
02:33 apparently this [ __ ] helicopter I'm
02:37 always fascinated by the human process
02:41 of accepting limitations even when
02:44 they're not there you know it's the old
02:46 story of the elephant being
02:48 pinned down to the ground so as a baby
02:50 they pinned them down with a big stake
02:52 in the ground and they can't move it but
02:54 by the time they get older and they're
02:55 the size of a freaking house they could
02:58 pull a thing out and leave but they
02:59 brainwash themselves into believing that
03:01 a rope to a little spike in the ground
03:03 is enough to hold them in place right we
03:08 do this to ourselves all the time we do
03:10 this to ourselves in relationships we do
03:12 it to ourselves in our careers and our
03:14 personal travels and I think we do it
03:17 when we wake up and when we go to sleep
03:22 it's interesting that when when I was a
03:25 kid that used to talk about flying in
03:27 your dreams and later in my life
03:30 somebody said that was good luck but you
03:34 know I didn't hear that kind of crap
03:34 when I was young but someone was talking
03:36 about it and I actually did it in a
03:38 dream and I'm not sure if I went to bed
03:39 going I'm gonna dream tonight and I'm
03:42 going to fly it just happened and then
03:47 it was one of these reoccurring things
03:48 that it wasn't happy
03:50 it didn't doesn't happen often but the
03:52 circumstances will come together and if
03:53 it's fun and cool to fly I'll fly and I
03:56 have had a fair amount of conversations
03:59 in the last couple years with people who
04:03 have never done it and there's this sort
04:05 of remorse in their voice sort of like a
04:09 I wish I could fly and of course my
04:13 brain I'm thinking now wait a minute
04:14 this is a dream why on earth could you
04:16 not fly if you wanted to and a big part
04:21 of it has to do with believing that you
04:23 can but what's interesting about flying
04:26 in a dream is that you do have to enter
04:31 a dream with your human brain your soul
04:33 brain whatever it is right and you
04:35 accepted in this particular reality that
04:38 you can't fly so to have the idea that
04:41 you could possibly fly in a dream with
04:45 or without lucidity in your dream right
04:48 I I don't think obviously I probably
04:53 can't honestly say I remember the first
04:55 time I ever flew in a dream I know
04:57 several times that I've flown in my
04:59 dream and I wasn't having the lucid
05:01 bit turned on first and then oh my god
05:04 I'm in a dream let's fly mm-hmm usually
05:08 when I get lucid in a dream there's like
05:10 a 10 to 30 second countdown before the
05:12 dream is over but here's the thing when
05:15 you can fly when you can do anything in
05:16 your dream that you can't do in this
05:19 reality then you're really massaging
05:21 that muscle that technique inside you
05:24 that grasps at a particular reality that
05:27 is the trivial reality that you are sold
05:29 as a kid again no one's trying
05:33 necessarily especially in your close
05:35 circles to deceive you I know there's a
05:38 lot of folks that believe that we've
05:41 been deceived into this reality and you
05:43 might be right that's what we're gonna
05:44 talk about the latest thing I've done
05:47 that's more interesting to me than
05:49 flying
05:50 even though flying is pretty fun is
05:52 telekinetics in my dreams I've had it
05:55 for quite some time but it's the need to
05:59 do it which is causing the rarity in the
06:03 dream for it to happen but they'll just
06:05 be moments where I'm in a dream and it
06:08 is you know it's a vain thing as much as
06:11 it's a fun thing because in your dreams
06:13 you fly because it makes people look at
06:15 you and you're special you move stuff
06:17 around the room and it makes people go
06:20 you get this distinct sense that they
06:23 can't do it and you're special because
06:25 you can and I don't know what that is in
06:27 humanity but it exists and I think a lot
06:30 of us so most of it's as you grow up
06:34 those kind of things become
06:35 entertainment well let me show you what
06:37 I can do that you probably can't do and
06:39 it's to entertain you it's not to make
06:41 you feel bad or anything like that
06:42 but I talked about this thing that
06:45 occurs to me every once in a while and I
06:50 can't really figure out any cyclical
06:54 nature to it I can't really figure out
06:56 whether or not it's happening a lot or a
06:58 little but I will be somewhere it's
07:04 usually when I'm moving in a vehicle
07:05 which is really odd you know think about
07:09 that that's probably the case it's
07:11 strange because I haven't
07:14 well I'll tell you another example after
07:18 I get done with this one but what ends
07:19 up happening is I'm traveling just
07:22 residential it had to be highways it
07:24 could be highways it sometimes does
07:27 happen on the highways and I get this
07:28 overlay in my mind's eye of a different
07:33 world it's earth world it's humans but
07:38 it is a much better world the design is
07:43 really beautiful it's very lived in it's
07:47 very manicured it feels peaceful so the
07:52 people who are writing the cars next to
07:54 me if I'm driving on the highway because
07:55 sometimes the it's just like being in
07:57 some movie where it's an overlay and all
07:59 of a sudden it's futuristic it's not
08:02 Blade Runner it's not you know George
08:05 Jetson kind of crap in fact it's just a
08:08 little bit ahead of where we are today
08:10 but it almost feels like a parallel
08:12 reality that yes they're still using
08:15 combustion based cars maybe I don't know
08:18 but they still have highways and they've
08:22 now figured out how to it would almost
08:24 be as if every designer became a Frank
08:26 Lloyd Wright disciple and they decided
08:28 that yes everything should blend him
08:30 structure should blend him with reiha
08:32 with nature and vice versa a lot of
08:36 times sometimes I will be in a broad
08:39 daylight beautiful world like today and
08:42 the one I'm seeing is a nighttime
08:44 recently rained Hollywood shot but the
08:50 visuals are impressive and they give me
08:53 this wonderful feeling but of just being
08:58 rewarded by oh man that's neat design
09:00 and it'll just show for like like a
09:01 split second like should be like one
09:03 second so it comes it fades in and fades
09:05 out within the second which seems like a
09:08 really short period of time but it's
09:10 such a profound feeling and it's so real
09:14 that it's interesting but it is sort of
09:17 like a hint of a reality I don't have a
09:21 true you know super duper reality
09:25 replacement of what I'm seeing it is
09:27 more like
09:28 up in here my mind's eye it's really
09:31 strange but in almost all scenarios that
09:37 I'm gonna think of all the ones I can
09:39 remember offhand it's a much more
09:45 balanced world like the people feel to
09:49 me like everyone's calmed down it
09:53 doesn't mean there's not arguments
09:54 doesn't mean someone doesn't I mean I
09:57 don't know I don't get the idea of theft
09:58 or anything like that but you know
09:59 whatever there's probably still issues
10:03 but so this this happens to me and I
10:06 don't think it's increased in any way
10:08 shape or form maybe it has but not much
10:10 and I've been noticing like I don't know
10:16 if this has been going on my entire life
10:19 because here's the thing I grew up in
10:21 the 70s there's a you know birth to ten
10:25 years old
10:25 and the 70s obviously had tremendously
10:29 different design principles
10:31 my father was definitely into you know
10:35 the latest and greatest of things and so
10:37 I was able to see even if it was just
10:39 pictures a lot of places that I don't
10:44 know if the neighbors kids were seeing
10:45 it then I got to travel and so I got to
10:48 see a lot of that I saw his stuff as a
10:51 2-door zero to two and a half in Europe
10:54 but I don't really super consciously
10:56 remember so I don't know if that's part
10:58 of the influence doesn't feel European
11:01 but I have this host of memories from
11:05 the 70s of locations that I can't
11:08 remember ever being at ever that very
11:12 70s extremely 70s
11:15 designs and so I'm starting to wonder
11:21 today how long has this thing been going
11:24 on right it's a very peaceful very
11:27 gentle thing sound like you will
11:30 suddenly drive off a cliff or you know
11:33 go rampaging through some mall but the
11:36 other day I had something interesting
11:38 happen which was
11:39 I taste it for the first time in a dream
11:43 and I mean it was it was unbelievably
11:47 accurate a friend of mine had said
11:54 they're gonna get me some special hot
11:55 sauce because I love really exotic super
11:58 hot hot sauces right even if I can't eat
12:02 him as quickly as I'd like and so I had
12:05 this hot sauce stuff on my brain and in
12:07 my dream I was in sort of a vineyard of
12:09 hot sauce peppers super hots and someone
12:14 was like oh you should taste this you
12:16 should taste this and sort of hanging on
12:17 this wooden lattice which was very basic
12:20 right about two feet wide and about
12:22 every like the first one was four feet a
12:24 little little one by one and then
12:27 another one and they're just hanging off
12:28 you could see a place to grow which is
12:30 strange because most of them grow on
12:32 little bushes but I picked this little
12:36 red one off and eat it and the taste I
12:39 got was very unique it was orange lime
12:42 and it popped in my mouth I got the
12:45 citrusy lime thing and I remember just
12:50 it was it hit me and I was like wow I'm
12:52 really tasting this yeah I got the lime
12:54 thing and then I moved to the next one
12:55 over and then I woke up so it's very you
12:59 know
12:59 quick quick moment from the moment I ate
13:02 this thing the moment I woke up I said
13:05 that I'm thinking okay finally finally I
13:08 know that I've tasted something that
13:11 wasn't in the room I hadn't eaten the
13:14 lime in a while and I certainly haven't
13:16 eaten orange in a while so those aren't
13:18 recent tastes that I've had in that
13:20 particular day week or month and now I'm
13:24 resurrecting those impressions in my
13:27 mind for a drink so for the rest of that
13:33 day just like two days ago I'm thinking
13:37 okay how is that possible it must be
13:39 that you know there's a memory inside my
13:42 system for tasting this although I can't
13:44 remember ever tasting orange and lime
13:48 together and one bite it was almost like
13:50 one of those little
13:52 tangerine things those little tiny ones
13:54 you know I forgot to call him and like
13:56 one little tiny slice of that had the
13:58 lime in it as well it's really strange
14:00 man it's very pleasant so then it
14:03 started to dawn on me that if I can take
14:06 memory patterns right memory tracks as
14:09 they would say in Twilight Zone and push
14:12 them into my dreams for all of the five
14:17 senses that I have what stops it coming
14:23 back the other way a dream state coming
14:27 into this state now we know so there are
14:29 some people out there that we might
14:30 label as less than on planet Earth I'm
14:37 not really talking about that I'm
14:38 talking about a useful mechanism by
14:41 which we can sort of pull back from the
14:46 technique of grasping reality in it
14:50 involuntarily speaking and get to a
14:52 point where we can start you know it's
14:55 like when you peel a sticker off that
14:57 looks like it's embedded in something
14:58 like you didn't think it was a sticker
15:00 but yeah and you kind of put your
15:02 thumbnail on it oh my god there it is
15:03 right it's really gonna be careful to
15:05 pull it off because it's gonna rip or
15:07 tear or whatever it's one of those
15:08 situations we're trying to find the
15:10 little lip the 90-degree turn in
15:13 thinking that would give us additional
15:17 control over our grasp of reality and my
15:22 suspicion is is that there are things
15:25 that we do to actively grasp reality
15:28 every day that we don't consciously
15:31 recognize and I'm wondering if we can
15:34 through triangulation and discussion and
15:36 analysis find those mechanisms right
15:41 there's been a couple stories out there
15:45 about floors and buildings that are
15:50 hidden there's some Twilight zones to do
15:55 that and it's just over my life I've
15:57 seen this where like either an elevator
16:00 stops at a floor that normally skips
16:04 it's either the tippy-top floor or the
16:06 13th floor and there's just some
16:08 mezzanine floor effectors and there
16:10 wasn't there a script there's a film out
16:12 there that actually had a a floor that
16:14 was really short and so everybody was in
16:17 this building they were doing business
16:19 and he was like a Monty Python thing I
16:21 can't remember what it was in the
16:23 twilight zone the twilight zone is the
16:25 state between being awake and being in a
16:27 dream state right we all travel through
16:30 it every single day and rod serling I
16:33 think in his many intros and and exits
16:39 and the the various changing theme
16:42 opening dialogue monologue of his show
16:45 it was always as if he was saying people
16:49 take a turn and go into this lair of
16:53 this why lights own instead of going
16:55 straight through it like a membrane
16:56 right so it'd be like taking a turn into
16:58 the Van Allen belts and just staying
16:59 there and finding the the Nexus ring and
17:03 Captain Kirk's in there right I think a
17:05 lot of people don't think about having
17:07 dreams they just simply have them which
17:10 is sort of how reality works right you
17:11 wake up you just inadvertently accept it
17:14 and then you allow things to happen to
17:15 you yeah maybe that's okay I mean
17:19 obviously it serves most of us but for
17:21 those of us they're trying to be the
17:22 Magellan's of reality we need to develop
17:28 some tools some thinking some methods of
17:32 enlightening not only ourselves but each
17:35 other and then others outside right is
17:39 the famous scene in the matrix where the
17:40 kid bends the spoon and it's probably
17:44 one of my favorite lines in the entire
17:46 movie because Neal's looking at him the
17:48 cool thing about Neos character is he
17:49 has no ego right he grabs the spoon and
17:54 the kid says you know it's not that
17:56 you're bending the spoon it's that
17:58 you're bending reality around the spoon
18:00 something's that effect right and he
18:03 looks and sure enough the spoon turns
18:05 and then it comes back up that one
18:08 sentence flips the entire paradigm of
18:10 what you're trying to do to get to the
18:14 goal that you're trying to get to right
18:17 you want have been this button mm-hmm
18:19 well the spoons not gonna Bend Ben
18:21 reality around it and then you get what
18:23 you want how do we apply that to our
18:28 notion of grasping a particular Rowlett
18:31 reality over another the other fictional
18:35 piece that I like to think about when
18:38 trying to abstract yourself away from
18:41 reality and probably very few of you
18:44 have actually read this but The
18:46 Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy which I
18:48 mentioned off and on it has a great
18:51 scene in it where I'm trying to figure
18:56 out a way to get everyone up to speed
18:58 they're trying to find this guy named
19:00 Johnny Wu and they find out that find
19:04 out that he is hiding inside of a
19:05 universe that is inside of his office
19:07 and they want to ask him the question of
19:10 who actually runs the galaxy and the
19:13 whole thing is really about being woke -
19:15 who runs the galaxy and they end up
19:19 through a bunch of different turns
19:21 finding this weird mystic guy that lives
19:24 on the edge of therefore they're
19:27 accessible galaxies he has a cat he
19:31 lives up in a and a cabin by himself on
19:34 the coast I think and he will not accept
19:37 any reality a hundred percent and they
19:43 asked him they finally find him they go
19:45 are you so and so and he goes well I
19:46 think I am you know and he says we'll do
19:49 you do you run the universe or do you
19:52 run the galaxy he's like I don't think
19:55 so
19:55 you know I'm not sure and they said well
19:58 the people come to you to ask you
19:59 questions and he goes well I think they
20:01 do I think that what I'm seeing are
20:03 spaceships coming you know down from the
20:06 from above and that these Ben come out
20:08 and they asked me questions I think
20:10 they're doing that you know
20:11 lord knows but Poppa bunnies oh you said
20:13 the Lord you you believe in it and he
20:15 goes no like my cat I call him the Lord
20:17 at least I think he's a cat right it's
20:20 this very interesting method of talking
20:22 such that you you never quite convince
20:27 yourself conclusively that anything is
20:29 real
20:30 now I don't think any of us want to be
20:32 living in the final act of altered
20:35 states where we don't know where the
20:36 hell we are
20:37 and what reality and what timeline but
20:41 it might be interesting for us to label
20:43 you always say labels are bad
20:46 I think this label might be good to
20:48 label the reality that we accept as the
20:51 particular reality that we're in right I
20:54 think a lot of you do this anyway if you
20:57 believe you're in a matrix or in a
20:59 firmer Madame or you're in some
21:00 heliocentric ball regardless of what you
21:05 think or you're in you're undecided you
21:08 think there's a fourth thing the idea
21:10 might be really healthy to go okay when
21:13 I wake up when my soul returns to my
21:16 body through the silver court attachment
21:18 and I'm starting to look through this
21:20 John Malkovich machine which is my body
21:23 this is the reality that I am accepting
21:26 currently but when I go to dream world I
21:30 am NOT really resting at all my body is
21:34 gonna remain 99.9% completely intact
21:37 running all the operations right the
21:41 only thing is gonna change is I'm not
21:42 necessarily walking talking and moving
21:44 so my muscles get a chance to repair and
21:47 relax and I think there's got to be some
21:50 need for the soul to leave the body in
21:52 my opinion which is why everything has
21:55 to rest it's bizarre right there's no
21:59 need for everything to rest it just
22:02 isn't for us to be on this perfect
22:04 cyclical thing that you're awake 18
22:09 hours a day and then you sleep eight
22:10 hours a day and then you wake up and
22:12 insects do it and birds and bees and all
22:15 that stuff right there should be
22:17 something that just stays awake just
22:20 it's efficient as no need to release
22:23 itself that's not the case is it
22:28 that maybe little single-cell bacteria
22:32 and some amoebas and that kind of stuff
22:34 they probably go balls-out until they
22:36 die but if you this is what I do to
22:39 dream is that I really feel like my
22:42 dreaming is just going to another world
22:44 and living eight hours or whatever I'm
22:46 getting six to eight hours right I also
22:51 feel like my dreams have a particular
22:55 location it's sort of like a new
22:58 Disneyland but it's in a caricature form
23:01 like the map right wherever I am usually
23:05 some random community of some sort to be
23:09 very lived in city with skyscrapers
23:12 that's very common sometimes I'm back in
23:15 my hometown but it's in the future
23:17 sometimes I'm just inside some wild home
23:21 and some neighborhood somewhere time of
23:26 day could be all times of date but
23:28 what's interesting is is I'm sleeping
23:30 anywhere between Sun being down and Sun
23:34 being up depending on how I'm working on
23:37 a particular month and so it doesn't
23:42 seem to correlate with my dream so it
23:44 could be dark outside and I'll be
23:46 dreaming light or I'll be light outside
23:47 I'm dreaming dark so snow seems doesn't
23:49 seem to be any adherence to that but the
23:51 other one is that my locations will only
23:55 last about a week and then I get a new
23:58 location it's like a second hand or a
24:02 minute hand on a clock okay then I got
24:06 the one o'clock location and I got the
24:08 two o'clock location it takes a week or
24:10 so de to get to the new spot sometimes I
24:13 outwardly request before going to bed a
24:16 new location like I'm done with that one
24:19 you know it's been two weeks an hour or
24:20 whatever it's done a little bit long
24:22 let's go to somewhere somewhere new and
24:24 somehow something changes it now the the
24:28 other really interesting one about
24:31 locations is that a lot of times it can
24:33 be influenced by what you've done before
24:34 you go to bed for those of us guys who
24:38 have played video games for hours and
24:40 hours an hour
24:41 might play a Fallout game or I was
24:45 watching these raid videos of rust rust
24:49 is a game that released in 2013 is
24:52 probably of all the games I've ever seen
24:57 that are first-person survival kind of
25:00 games which is the only objective this
25:02 game has rust is probably the most
25:04 difficult game I've ever seen you start
25:06 naked with a little rock in your hand
25:07 and if you die at any point in time no
25:10 matter if your level whatever there's
25:14 not really levels I don't think but if
25:15 you have all this stuff on you or a rock
25:17 and people can take everything off of
25:18 you it's the old 1998 in my mode design
25:21 I watched a couple of these videos
25:24 before going to bed a few days ago and
25:28 then my dream was sort of watching rust
25:31 reeds it's interesting there was no real
25:34 context of watching a raid where I could
25:36 get excited about something getting
25:38 stolen or knocked down or building
25:40 getting broken into it was just watching
25:41 these guys run around and it was so
25:44 repetitive that I got tired of it and I
25:49 woke up from it and I was like I don't
25:51 want to I don't wanna see that so I went
25:54 and look to other things on the web in
25:56 bed so I could kind of wash my mind out
25:58 of this other thing I had seen but now
26:03 the the weird thing about this
26:07 overlaying thing that I experienced and
26:09 it's very rare I mean it's probably I
26:12 don't know the frequency it might be a
26:14 really heavy frequency might be like
26:17 once a month maybe and sometimes it
26:21 comes in at like 10% and sometimes it
26:24 comes in at like a hundred percent very
26:27 vivid and it's one of those moments when
26:30 you sort of drift off and thinking for
26:33 those of you you know you daydream and
26:36 you're imagine maybe a creative person
26:39 and your employment relies on you being
26:41 creative see I was kind of chewing up an
26:43 idea or sometimes you're just
26:47 absent-minded first one second you're
26:49 relaxing right I don't mean
26:51 absent-minded any bad way whatsoever and
26:54 it it
26:55 harkens to that scene I think it's in
26:57 Indiana Jones 3 with Sean Connery where
27:00 he and his son Indiana Jones are stuck
27:03 in a tower some Nazi Castle they've
27:06 taken over and they need to get down
27:09 Germans are coming and his father says
27:13 well you know what I find is that if I
27:16 just sit down and relax the solution
27:20 comes to me and he sits down on a chair
27:21 and the chair is rigged to a lever in
27:24 one of the legs and boom a staircase
27:26 appears and they get out of there well
27:29 you need to understand that when you
27:31 watch movies or television shows and
27:33 it's the good kind right even if the bad
27:38 kind
27:38 this is this what I'm about to tell you
27:40 is very important to remember a human
27:43 being wrote the script and so they chose
27:47 the words and they chose the thought
27:50 process they're trying to put in your
27:51 mind because it comes from their own
27:53 personal experience either be it
27:56 observed and not experienced by them
27:58 personally or it's their little trick
28:01 and so a writer wrote if I sit down and
28:07 relax it into my mind the solution comes
28:10 to me that might be a little trick of
28:13 that particular writer and I may be a
28:18 solution for actually writing might be a
28:20 solution for everything you know for
28:24 those of you who've ever had an epiphany
28:25 in the shower it's happened to me
28:28 numerous times hasn't happened to me in
28:29 a while but I don't really have problems
28:32 that are of that nature right now in my
28:35 life what is it though what is the step
28:38 just before you have that epiphany
28:40 you're in the shower and obviously when
28:42 you get into a shower all of us have our
28:43 routine you know or the night you do
28:45 your hair first or your body first or
28:47 whatever and then you might sit and wait
28:49 you know just to get warmed up or cooled
28:52 off or let your air conditioner do its
28:57 thing
28:57 whatever and I find that when I get that
29:02 60,000 foot stair that's when the magic
29:06 happens and it's like this
29:09 dull of solution and its complete
29:13 solution it's amazing a couple years ago
29:17 with my startup I was looking at some
29:20 hardware that feeds LED screens and I'm
29:27 looking at this hardware and I'm
29:28 realizing that the hardware that drives
29:30 the imagery into these machines that
29:33 slice up the image then sends it off to
29:35 the LED cabinets which in further slices
29:38 it up into tiny little cell phone screen
29:40 PCBs they're all using off-the-shelf
29:44 stuff and so they're like whoa I know
29:48 how we can get this to work you use
29:49 off-the-shelf this off-the-shelf that
29:51 then we'll develop this this is unique
29:53 which we'll talk to the LED screens
29:55 which are also being developed every day
29:57 and I start looking at the paradigms of
30:01 the technology and I'm sitting there
30:02 going there's got to be a better way now
30:05 the first thing I needed to do define
30:07 this other solution was to have the
30:09 feeling this this is ridiculous no one
30:14 else in the room is thinking this is
30:15 ridiculous everyone else in the room is
30:17 thinking this is the way it's done these
30:19 are the paradigms limitations of this
30:21 technology there will be no other
30:22 technology well when I discovered this
30:26 other methodology to streamline this
30:28 whole thing and make it so much easier
30:31 to increase the integrity of the signal
30:34 to be able to protect it better than any
30:37 attempt previous to protect the actual
30:40 data coming through being the imagery
30:41 and the sound and all the other DCI
30:43 level movie stuff that has to occur I
30:47 went home and wrote a 75-page document
30:50 on it proving that theoretically this is
30:55 completely possible and it took it was
31:00 that document that essentially kept our
31:03 company funded for another year now some
31:07 other things happen that that blew it
31:08 apart at the end I think my investor
31:11 alone was not he was an older guy and I
31:14 think he was just looking at a really
31:15 long haul and he's like man I I got a
31:17 kid I got a brand-new little kid and I
31:19 got three older kids and I'm gonna live
31:22 my life
31:22 enjoy life and this is this is for
31:24 someone else to invest in and I don't
31:27 blame him it's always disappointing when
31:30 that kind of thing happens and then
31:32 through some other [ __ ] or unable to
31:34 regroup and go find new investors and so
31:37 I decided to go partner with a company
31:40 that actually deals with that technology
31:43 directly but there's a super commonality
31:47 with those epiphanies I'm curious if you
31:50 guys have had the same thing if that is
31:54 true
31:55 now let's just say that's true let's go
31:58 with that we all get the 60,000 foot
32:01 stereo we're in a sort of a daydream
32:02 mode whether we're standing in a shower
32:04 or driving in our cars or whatever and
32:08 we get these bundles of total solution
32:12 it's not the source code necessarily
32:14 it's not the words in your script but
32:16 it's definitely the stuff that's going
32:18 to get you to create that stuff for
32:20 yourself right I think the universe is
32:22 extremely well let me put this way I
32:26 think that the purpose of the universe
32:28 is to feed you concepts that will turn
32:34 into potentially opportunities concepts
32:37 that will hopefully spark you into
32:39 developing a talent which is just any
32:42 discipline that you're good at and then
32:44 by getting good at a discipline this is
32:47 what we call luck you know luck is hard
32:49 work you have to be good at something to
32:53 take advantage of luck slash opportunity
32:55 right I mean I give you a really crude
32:58 example but there's a lot of folks out
33:00 there that want to be rappers or
33:02 musicians of any kind but rappers is a
33:05 really easy one because it's a guy that
33:07 writes lyrics walks in someone sells him
33:09 a beat and they make music and then
33:12 money
33:13 well imagine somebody wants to be this
33:16 and they one guy there's two of them
33:19 right one dude is doing it all the time
33:21 he is rapping everywhere in his mind
33:23 he's exhausting all of the basic words
33:27 that have been in all the previous
33:28 lyrics that he or she has heard before
33:31 so they don't reuse them so it'll sound
33:33 like some old rap and the other guy is
33:36 just doing everyone else's stuff and
33:40 doing it really really well and maybe
33:42 can do like a super fast rap and he gets
33:44 it all down but he doesn't quite have
33:46 the idea of writing his own stuff or if
33:49 he does it's really tough and when he
33:51 does a rap battle it's not it doesn't
33:53 sound fluent here you know it just is a
33:56 trainwreck right so both of them are
34:00 going to get a chance to meet some
34:02 big-ass producers and Dre and he's got
34:06 time to listen well he's gonna listen to
34:09 one guy who's regurgitating a bunch of
34:11 crap means you know listen to the person
34:13 it's coming in with their own stuff
34:15 who's gonna get the job who's gonna get
34:18 the contract who's gonna get the
34:19 opportunity to try and create anywhere
34:22 between 12 and 20 tracks to create an
34:25 album the second guy or I should say the
34:28 first guy mentioned right the one that's
34:30 really practiced the reason I mentioned
34:33 that is that it's sort of the the more
34:36 that you do that sort of exercise with
34:40 yourself with whatever you're doing
34:41 you're visiting this mechanism
34:43 constantly your creative flow the river
34:47 of knowledge right and so it's the
34:51 talent and the job and the dream that's
34:54 forcing you or inspiring you to go to
34:56 the river of knowledge instead of waking
35:00 up in the morning and maybe think of the
35:02 thinking of yourself as a Nostradamus
35:04 right as I just mentioned in another
35:05 episode
35:06 what if you got up in the morning you
35:10 have a cool pad and you look out at the
35:15 world and you realize that they all look
35:18 to you sometimes they see your face
35:20 there you go Oh have you got any more
35:23 predictions of the future because that's
35:26 what we rely on you to do you're that
35:29 special person who dedicate your life to
35:32 seeing the future
35:33 my buddy Syd Mead that's what he does he
35:37 does it in a fictional way but he looks
35:40 at everything all the time someone was
35:44 busting my balls about the difference
35:46 between being brilliant and barring a
35:47 genius
35:48 I said well you know maybe I have it
35:52 maybe I have the definition confused
35:53 between the two but go ahead and tell me
35:55 what you think I don't think there's
35:57 been a reply in the comments I would say
35:59 Sydney tis definitely both even if
36:01 they're different definitions but now
36:05 some of you might have very normal jobs
36:07 some of you might be going to college
36:09 some of you might be very overwhelmed
36:12 with your current responsibilities so
36:14 not that it's a negative thing it's just
36:15 you have a couple kids and you got a
36:17 spouse and you got a job baby you got
36:19 two jobs one you love and what's your
36:22 side thing when you come home and the
36:23 one that you got to go to pay the bills
36:25 whatever it is and you might think why
36:27 don't have time to do all this
36:29 experimentation with Who I am and the
36:32 reality that I'm grasping I think you do
36:35 I think you do and I think you do it
36:38 anyway for any of you who have ever said
36:42 the statement if you would have told me
36:44 a year ago that I would be doing this
36:46 right now
36:47 I would have told you that you're crazy
36:49 I don't know how many people actually
36:52 have that experience I would imagine
36:53 it's less than more but once you've had
36:59 that experience you've changed your
37:00 career for instance even if you
37:05 suspected it in your mind well I'd
37:07 really like to do this but I don't know
37:09 how to get into it and find finally you
37:10 get into it you realize that you can
37:13 change your life on a dime merely by
37:18 convincing yourself that it can be done
37:21 when I grew up there was no internet and
37:24 so knowing what was going on in New York
37:29 or Los Angeles was the matter of
37:32 watching maybe a rock video seeing some
37:35 movies and television show which we all
37:37 know is kind of a character of reality
37:39 maybe you see a documentary that's a
37:40 little more intense and so if you wanted
37:44 to be in the Midwest of the United
37:46 States of America and you wanted to be a
37:48 comedian an actor a singer it's a it was
37:53 a tough haul for you to grasp that
37:56 reality and your family and friends
37:58 least the 70s and 80s in the Midwest
38:00 would not necessarily be
38:03 supportive because they too have no
38:05 knowledge of how this is done and
38:07 therefore it would seem an impossibility
38:09 perhaps to them and there was in the in
38:14 the 80s for those of you didn't live in
38:15 the 80s I remember seeing one interview
38:18 after another that said that people who
38:21 succeeded were like you know my parents
38:23 were first very disappointed when I said
38:25 I was to become an actor or comedian or
38:27 whatever the hell it is singer because
38:29 they worried about me bottoming it out
38:30 having no money you know unfortunately
38:34 probably more than 51% of them do not
38:38 succeed and I attribute that almost
38:41 exclusively to them having more ambition
38:44 to get the status of being that than the
38:48 ambition to get good at it right with
38:51 all skills let me just tell you the
38:52 secret before we get back on track here
38:55 for everything you want to get good at
38:57 if you just simply get good at it
38:59 because it is something that you want
39:00 personally for your life you will
39:04 eventually entertain other people with
39:06 your personal entertainment mechanism
39:08 right Prince always said I make music
39:11 that makes me feel good that because the
39:14 music doesn't exist and I want the music
39:16 to exist and so he worked really hard to
39:19 learn all the instruments right when he
39:20 passed away you know I think he played
39:23 over 40 instruments and all of his songs
39:26 combined right probably more nap but
39:29 honestly he only needed about four
39:31 instruments guitar probably being played
39:35 two different styles from lead to rhythm
39:39 then you got your bass your keyboard and
39:41 your drums with those four things he
39:44 could create any of the music that he
39:46 loved and he did but he created for
39:50 himself first and then everyone else
39:52 liked it Steve Jobs oh he said I'm
39:54 creating products that I like and you
39:57 like them too and if he ever changed his
40:00 methodology and said I'm gonna listen to
40:01 a marketing firm tell me what the people
40:04 want he says at that point we're gonna
40:06 lose and that's why the Capel's having
40:10 major issues at this point right
40:12 but isn't a life a and a life B that's
40:18 completely different that you could
40:19 personally live both of them aren't they
40:22 technically little subsets of reality
40:25 you know when I moved from the Midwest
40:27 to California my first job in California
40:31 is working for Jim Hall jr. racing and I
40:36 just looked him up the other day and he
40:37 doesn't doesn't look like he races the
40:40 kind of things that we were racing back
40:41 in the day we used to race the little
40:44 carts with the K sort of like $10,000
40:47 looks like go-karts but they're open
40:49 pipe carts and very expensive very
40:53 professional they have centrifugal
40:54 clutch two cycle engines and that kind
40:56 of stuff but I went from you know really
41:00 being accepted in my hometown for all
41:04 the reasons I've mentioned in the past
41:06 family lineage and that kind of stuff I
41:08 managed to live last I think four years
41:11 of my life there before I graduated high
41:13 school coming off of other six schools I
41:16 went to before that and so it was a good
41:18 world where I came from I left I went to
41:21 California and now I was working for a
41:24 race car place and I'm thinking to
41:26 myself this is a whole nother reality I
41:30 live on a beach area I go to a race
41:33 track I go to other race tracks locally
41:36 I am hanging out with these families
41:39 like the unser family the whole family
41:42 the firestone family all kinds of other
41:46 reps coming in that the girls were all
41:48 over us young guys so we go to a party
41:52 and sit in the jacuzzi and there was
41:55 really nothing that they wouldn't do for
41:56 us it's really weird I'm like 18 years
41:58 old most of the kids are between 18 and
42:00 22 or somewhere in there right so I was
42:03 taught very early that you you will get
42:06 rewarded sometimes proportion until your
42:08 risk which is one of the classic phrases
42:10 you'll hear people who have done it will
42:12 say to you nothing risk nothing gain is
42:15 the cliche it's very true most cliches
42:19 have unfortunately a lot of truth behind
42:21 them and we poopoo them away from us
42:23 because they are
42:25 cliches right about three months later I
42:30 find myself in a software company now
42:33 able to take advantage of all my
42:35 artistic digital talent all my
42:37 programming talent and I was off to the
42:41 races I mean just climbing through this
42:43 company at this enormous pace it was a
42:46 tiny company so the husband wife Morgan
42:48 family that invented this product was
42:51 you could go talk to him
42:53 yeah even though Michael the core
42:56 founder was more aloof because he was
42:59 more private with his life but still
43:02 surrounded by amazing talent another
43:05 reality completely different than my
43:07 race car reality I got laid off two days
43:12 later I'm a video game artist
43:13 professionally all my money is coming
43:16 from that venture right it's old-school
43:19 stuff compared to the stuff we do today
43:21 but I just kept pushing and pushing and
43:25 pushing and never telling myself that I
43:27 can't do something quite the opposite
43:29 and I mean the amount of weird ass jobs
43:32 I've had from I mean I'll just throw a
43:35 couple at you just so that you
43:37 understand that once you stop just
43:40 digging your claws into where you are
43:43 and saying I certainly would like to
43:45 change my life and make it better that
43:49 but then you're hanging on you can't
43:50 just let go and go woof I need to jump
43:52 out of this plane I got a parachute on
43:54 not sure where I'm gonna land doesn't
43:56 look too bad down there right sometimes
43:58 you know exactly where you want to go it
44:01 could just be a profession in your brain
44:02 to be a physical location you need to
44:04 move to or visit or whatever right but I
44:08 had a friend of mine in a Southern
44:09 California is really awesome about
44:10 networking and so when someone needs
44:13 something they just tap all their
44:15 friends it's crazy the amount of startup
44:18 so I was involved in was crazy several
44:20 of which I've talked about on this show
44:22 but I had one guy come to me to design
44:25 silk suits right because he goes well
44:29 you're an artist right I'm said yeah you
44:30 dress pretty wild I said yeah he goes
44:32 this guy's looking for some new designs
44:34 go for it hey if he doesn't take it
44:37 that's fine if he takes it good
44:39 so for I don't know six months I was
44:42 drawing all kinds of different suits
44:44 yeah very 80s kind of you know wild
44:48 suits and stuff I don't know if the guy
44:50 ever actually ended up using any of this
44:51 stuff but I was delivering them in get a
44:53 good feedback
44:54 I was probably an idiot right because I
44:55 could have made some money off of it
44:56 maybe even stayed in the industry or
44:58 whatever
44:59 I think it's Einstein that's credited
45:03 was saying this phrase I believe but
45:05 it's something to the effect of you know
45:07 reality is simply the most popular
45:09 fiction and there could be multiple
45:14 layers to that statement not quite the
45:16 matrix level interpretation we might
45:19 have on this show because we're very
45:20 open-minded on this show but he could
45:25 have meant the people of the world
45:27 believed a fictional reality you know
45:30 they believed went to the moon I believe
45:33 the revised history of why wars occur
45:36 and why people are assassinated and all
45:37 this other stuff and if you get to the
45:40 upper echelon of people they start to
45:42 kind of whisper to you you know that's
45:44 all [ __ ] right in here oh yeah yeah
45:45 I know it is right it doesn't predict
45:48 anything one of the things I used to say
45:50 in the first season over and over and
45:52 over again was you know truth predicts
45:56 reality it predicts the future and like
46:00 if I say this this cause and effect
46:02 model works like you do this and it
46:05 creates that effect in your life then if
46:10 it's true for you it'll work if it's not
46:13 true for you it doesn't work until you
46:15 throw that one away or maybe you analyze
46:17 how you're executing against the the
46:20 cause maybe you need to work a little
46:22 harder right if I say practicing the
46:24 guitar makes you better at the guitar
46:26 and you practice practice practice and
46:28 you're no no better than you were in
46:29 your mind and you were when you first
46:32 started maybe what you're practicing
46:34 isn't the right stuff you need to get
46:35 someone else to teach you what you want
46:37 to know about the guitar right but as I
46:41 said in when I think one of my first
46:42 dream episodes why do we dream why do we
46:45 dream man why don't we go to bed why
46:47 don't we fall asleep why can't a human
46:49 being
46:49 rest in bed all day and then
46:53 not have to sleep that night you're
46:54 still awake in your bed but you haven't
46:56 moved your body much right you're you
46:58 don't tax your mind that much maybe just
47:00 watch some TV if you're sick or
47:02 something or you just need to be lazy
47:04 for a day in that particular case why
47:07 would you be on some cyclical need to go
47:10 to sleep now
47:10 your doctors and your neural surgeon
47:13 your neural scientists will tell you
47:15 well you've got a bunch of chemicals in
47:16 your body that start to secrete into
47:19 your system which put you to sleep okay
47:23 but usually in either divine
47:27 intervention design or evolutions but
47:31 you know what's your ever way you come
47:33 to you both are going to be coming to
47:34 the same conclusion which is you have
47:36 things because you need them now there's
47:39 still a bunch of mysteries with that
47:41 which is like why do guys lose their
47:42 hair why do we get hair on our ears and
47:46 our backs later on in life I mean it's
47:48 like why is that happening right but
47:50 sleep is this thing now that we have the
47:55 metaphor of computers for those of you
47:59 play in the most right you might know
48:04 that the server goes down on a
48:05 particular day for a few hours while
48:07 they're backing up all the data if you
48:10 set your computer up to auto-update
48:12 software or the operating system you
48:14 know that might happen in the middle of
48:16 the morning at 4 o'clock while you're
48:17 asleep and you wake up and it's saying
48:18 you need to restart ok if this is a
48:23 matrix of some sort maybe we all need to
48:25 be upgraded in the middle of the night
48:28 what if it was like this you throw this
48:31 one at you for grasping realities and
48:32 determining where you are in this
48:34 universe you pine all day for change
48:39 that you would like to have in your life
48:41 you wish you were more something than
48:44 you are now maybe you miss maybe you
48:46 need to wish for being less of something
48:48 less lazy less angry less whatever you
48:55 need to be more devoted more creative
48:58 whatever and what if when you go to bed
49:02 I'm making this up but just think about
49:04 it for a second
49:06 while you're asleep I have a have an
49:09 episode called dream scaping which is
49:11 sort of this but this is a little bit
49:13 more on point your OS that is your soul
49:18 body symbiotic connection upgrades and
49:22 it gets you a little bit closer not a
49:25 full-bore thing you know wake up you
49:27 know being a completely different person
49:29 but you wake up and you've ever to your
49:32 goals because you're slowly defining
49:35 your goals right now let me take that a
49:40 step further in a more fictional sense
49:43 let's just say you had contact with the
49:47 Oracle God whatever you want to call it
49:51 and you say to God before you go to bed
49:54 you go look I really wish I had become
49:57 this whatever that is what should we say
50:01 let's say a rock star because I know a
50:03 little bit about that and gods looking
50:06 at you in your bed and saying okay well
50:08 you're a little old for that or you
50:11 don't know anything about what you're
50:12 really talking about I'm g.od I know
50:16 right I'm the person wrote the operating
50:18 system that allows rock stars to become
50:20 rock stars so let me well God would have
50:27 two choices right more than two but
50:29 let's just say two basic ones God turns
50:32 it on tomorrow and all of a sudden you
50:35 were you wake up and you're history has
50:37 been rewritten you actually have at
50:39 least an album that is popular you have
50:42 a band that you didn't have before I'm
50:45 assuming if you have this notion you're
50:48 probably some sort of lead participant
50:50 in your in your endeavor and you're all
50:54 the sudden on the road and you're on a
50:58 bus you know touring even if you're on a
51:02 big private plane it doesn't change much
51:03 and then you start getting exhausted you
51:08 have record execs up your ass for the
51:10 next album you're like look you guys
51:13 need to be writing some new stuff here
51:14 because we're gonna come off this two or
51:15 nine months like nine months
51:17 oh my god you're on the road constantly
51:19 right doesn't matter how popular you are
51:22 doesn't matter how fancy your bus is it
51:25 doesn't take the edge off of the
51:28 constant grind of this process so you're
51:31 having to pine for the next show but
51:33 they want you to pull out the guitar or
51:35 whatever you play you're Alerus is your
51:38 singer whatever and you're having to
51:39 pound out something and it's not just
51:41 writing a song for writing a song sake
51:43 they want you to write an album that's
51:44 better than the last one that you wrote
51:46 now obviously you're probably getting
51:49 better at your skills the more that you
51:51 perform in concerts you're learning more
51:53 about what the audience wants you're
51:56 also shapeshifting yourself as a person
51:59 you know not literally but you're
52:01 changing your performance you know did
52:04 the Freddie Mercury walk on stage as a
52:07 lead singer Queen on the first day and
52:10 have all of his stage presence that he
52:12 did the day he died hell no he learned
52:15 that he learned tricks he did something
52:16 serendipitous and he said you know how
52:19 they really reacted to that when gene
52:21 Simmons broke up a fight once and the
52:23 band Kiss some guy was beating up
52:25 somebody and he reached down and punched
52:27 a guy kicked the guy in the face or
52:29 whatever and the crowd went crazy then
52:34 he started paying people to do that so
52:35 he could create that fictional situation
52:37 again which made the crowd go crazy well
52:40 I think that our overall maestro knows
52:45 that if you went from relaxing every day
52:49 and going to the beach and chilling out
52:51 and enjoying your family and your
52:53 friends to immediately being transposed
52:57 onto a bus driving around performing you
52:59 have great gigs you have horrible gigs
53:02 you know you now when you get a cold
53:05 it's like the end of your career right
53:08 what is it Axl Rose just barf two's way
53:10 off a stage after being on for however
53:12 minutes II went on II did 20 out of 27
53:14 songs to say if that story is true that
53:18 guy you have no idea how hard that was
53:20 for him to do that right doesn't matter
53:22 if you like the guy or not that is a
53:26 boss that says the show must go on so it
53:29 doesn't happen like that in my opinion
53:30 because
53:31 you can't handle that Delta that change
53:35 in your life some people could maybe but
53:39 I think they would be fibbin a little
53:41 bit about how easy it was to transition
53:44 into that and and sometimes that happens
53:46 to bands that work really hard in the
53:48 basement and also in the album goes out
53:50 and it's pretty much that level of
53:52 transformation but now what is a more
53:55 healthy way to do it to F into it to
53:58 slowly acquire that to go through all
54:01 the pain and frustration of creating
54:03 your first album performing in little
54:05 tiny gigs and realizing that the
54:07 mistakes that you're making on stage
54:09 were in front of ten people instead of
54:11 twenty five thousand people it's much
54:14 better to do all those mistakes in front
54:16 of a smaller crowd we don't usually
54:19 think of the universe this way and by
54:21 saying when I say universe I mean
54:23 whatever your definition of reality is
54:24 whether you think you're a piece of
54:27 binary data and some memory bank
54:29 somewhere if you think you're really
54:30 organic memory in this universe right it
54:36 might be that the universe simply is
54:38 perfectly designed to control that
54:43 popping mechanism of going from state a
54:46 to state B it doesn't allow for gigantic
54:49 changes in reality maybe maybe it's not
54:55 like that but we accept it that's the
54:57 way it works and so we never really see
54:59 giant changes in our lives
55:02 now for any of you've ever gotten a job
55:04 that you're really dig that you just
55:06 couldn't imagine having before you had
55:08 it like when I started drawing video
55:10 games well pretty much a lot of those
55:13 careers I was telling you for me it was
55:14 like a big change but in most cases
55:18 other than the race card thing it was
55:21 very short-lived
55:21 I had pine to be an artist I had pine to
55:26 be an engineer a software engineer and
55:29 so at a story writer and all these
55:32 different things and so when I got there
55:35 I'd had experience in this even that was
55:37 doing these silk suits I had drawn
55:39 plenty of really cool apparel in the 80s
55:42 as a teenager leather jackets that I
55:45 would have loved to have had or cars
55:46 that I would have loved to have driven I
55:48 think a big part of reality is the word
55:51 accept ACC EPT to accept something in
55:57 your life take it in to allow to be your
56:00 reality you know if you've ever had a
56:04 bad relationship in your life that went
56:06 on longer than it should have
56:08 then you accepted that toxic situation
56:11 for your life and you have good reasons
56:14 why you did it you probably learned a
56:16 tremendous amount about how to have a
56:17 good relationship by being complicit to
56:20 a bad relationship you know what a good
56:23 job is because you've accepted a shitty
56:25 job for a while when you get a good job
56:28 boss or superior or CEO or whatever
56:32 that's running your company and you've
56:34 had some bad ones you're like oh my god
56:35 I'm in heaven it's inspiring to you but
56:40 let's talk about before we in this
56:41 episode a common phrase called the
56:44 reality distortion field I think I
56:48 touched on this a long time ago but this
56:50 is a good time to recap this thing Steve
56:53 Jobs was known for having this reality
56:56 distortion field and the interesting
56:59 thing was is that it was initially
57:01 communicated to others from his circle
57:04 that this guy is crazy they called it
57:07 the reality distortion field initially
57:09 because they were like this guy wants
57:11 the impossible he wants us to accomplish
57:14 things we've never accomplished which we
57:17 believed at the onset are impossible the
57:22 creation of the Macintosh computer is
57:25 probably if you study it is one of the
57:29 most remarkable pieces of proof that the
57:32 reality distortion field is real and
57:34 that it can you can apply it to your
57:37 life immediately and once you feel this
57:41 work in a fairly cognitive way in this
57:43 reality right the one that we always
57:45 accept it might help you in engineering
57:50 your reality to whatever the hell you
57:52 want it to be now I'm gonna tell you
57:57 when Steve Jobs died what happened they
57:59 greenlit a movie with Ashton Kutcher
58:01 like [ __ ] right away because there's a
58:05 group of people that don't want you to
58:10 recognize his talent and they don't want
58:12 you to be like him because they want to
58:15 control you and if you are smart as him
58:17 you're going to control your life and
58:20 your control probably other people's
58:21 lives who are gonna willingly be in your
58:24 distortion field that didn't go over
58:27 very well so they then greenlit the
58:29 Fassbender movie where he played Steve
58:31 Jobs and it was all about taking his
58:34 [ __ ] on him because he had this daughter
58:35 there was a contested custody thing you
58:39 know he was like well I just slept in
58:40 school a couple times and she had this
58:42 kid and now I need to care and I'm a
58:45 very genuine person and you know I don't
58:47 just hand out love because these
58:48 circumstances occurred now eventually he
58:50 reconciled everything and it was cool
58:53 but they wanted to take a [ __ ] on him
58:56 and so what I have to hear sometimes in
58:58 the comments but a lot of times in other
59:00 forums is how Steve was not everything
59:03 that they said he was and not everything
59:05 that he said he was which is very
59:07 interesting because that guy
59:08 I don't think said much about what he
59:11 was capable of doing besides I think
59:13 having a visual eye and style right but
59:17 the invention of the Macintosh computer
59:18 is probably one of the most unequivocal
59:21 moments in this guy's life where he
59:23 proved he was absolutely a visionary and
59:27 a genius as I've had it communicated to
59:32 me through various forums multiple times
59:35 he walked into a room of like I believe
59:38 12 engineers some being hardware some
59:42 being software if they could venture
59:44 rose to 15 he put a book on the table an
59:51 average-size book he said okay guys the
59:56 footprint of this computer that we're
59:57 going to make is going to fit on that
59:59 book we can pull the book away we can
60:02 draw a line around the book pull the
60:04 book away and when we put this computer
60:05 down it's going to fit inside that
60:07 little tiny rectangle
60:08 now remember computer
60:10 back in the day even the Apple 1 & 2
60:12 were desktop computers very cool looking
60:15 and on the Apple side and then IBM came
60:18 out with their personal computer which
60:19 is why we call it PC they can 80 81 or
60:21 so and it was a big giant heavy steel
60:24 box and you know just some farty green
60:27 dose monitor and that sort of thing
60:29 right
60:29 but these engineers had to think
60:32 different right away well we're gonna
60:35 have to make a PC board to run this
60:36 computer it's probably bigger than that
60:39 footprint right there and so he's like
60:41 okay you're going to make two PC boards
60:42 one that goes across the bottom it's got
60:44 power when it goes across the side
60:46 inside that's the CPU and all the brains
60:49 and all the roms that hold all the
60:50 operating system stuff and then I want
60:52 you to create an operating system that
60:53 takes advantage of what we learned from
60:55 the Lisa which was an acquisition that
60:58 was meant to die and the stuff that they
61:00 did Xerox PARC like a and Steve is
61:03 credited with taking the Xerox PARC
61:06 concept and giving it its true reality
61:09 right being able to double-click a
61:11 folder but something inside of a folder
61:13 standardizing fonts so they're readable
61:15 to the mind no matter how old you are
61:18 the Chicago font just tons of brilliance
61:21 scrollbars
61:22 all this really cool thing a soft Mouse
61:25 controller and fuzzy logic in it for
61:28 those of us through Macintosh people and
61:29 PC people at the same time you'd move a
61:31 mouse on a Mac and it had this fuzzy
61:33 logic this acceleration/deceleration
61:35 algorithm in it but when you moved it on
61:38 a PC it was so brutal that the second
61:41 you moved the mouse no matter what
61:43 happened this cursor is moving exactly
61:45 to the analog reader that's in your
61:47 mouse it was too brittle was too you
61:51 couldn't get fine-tuned things to happen
61:53 because you could barely move it just
61:54 one pixel it move like 10 pixels and
61:57 Steve figured that out and Steve had
61:58 this thing softened out but these
62:01 programmers and these engineers and
62:03 these UI designers all live in today
62:07 after the fact that they thought he was
62:09 crazy
62:09 they said he was extremely driven and
62:13 rude to them okay and the reality's
62:16 distortion field really had one
62:19 principal mechanism in it which is he
62:23 believed it could be done
62:24 he believed he picked the right people
62:26 to get it done but they initially didn't
62:29 believe they could do it and then
62:32 history proved they all not only could
62:35 do it but they did do it and for those
62:38 people you know again that whatever want
62:40 to engage in criticism on it
62:43 what is Microsoft Windows now it's the
62:47 same principle as the GUI Mac and what
62:51 is Ubuntu
62:53 it's a GUI Mac it's much better
62:56 I might actually end up saying it's more
62:58 like a next computer but he was able to
63:01 convince people that they could do
63:03 something that they didn't think they
63:04 could do I think that's super duper
63:07 important I've hired in my lifetime
63:10 several employees that had basically no
63:12 experience and I simply told them that I
63:16 completely believed in them and when
63:19 they doubted themselves I pointed out
63:20 that their portfolio proved that they
63:23 had the talents to either grow into what
63:25 we needed them to be or they already had
63:27 them right a couple key employees that I
63:33 brought on board were two females to
63:35 different positions they're two
63:37 different companies one was my company
63:38 and one was Electronic Arts I was I
63:42 think I mentioned one of these two in
63:45 the past but one girl she I can't even
63:49 recall her name at this point but she
63:50 was living in San Rafael California
63:53 which was quite a ways away from
63:56 Electronic Arts which was in Redwood
63:58 Shores we're talking about to our
64:01 commutes but a buddy of mine was
64:04 chatting with her and then some chat
64:08 software somewhere on the internet and
64:09 he was needing a website he had seen her
64:12 website said man you got a you're
64:15 building a new web department at EA and
64:17 I'm like yeah she goes well you should
64:18 talk to this girl she's pretty amazing I
64:20 said okay so I talked to her and she
64:24 shows me her stuff and I'm looking at
64:26 her coding I'm looking at her design I'm
64:28 thinking wow this kid is really talented
64:29 she was 18 years old
64:32 so I said hey I got positions if you
64:35 want one I'll bring you in
64:37 tranq darts at the time very tough
64:39 company to get into but I said the
64:42 Internet's opening up opportunities at
64:44 this company that it's never been you
64:47 know around before was easy higher
64:49 moments right because I'm building this
64:51 team so I hired her she worked before me
64:53 for two years and eventually quit
64:56 because she never left San Rafael I
64:58 thought she was gonna move local and she
65:00 was driving like two to three hours a
65:02 day one way and she said you know I
65:04 really just want to spend time with my
65:05 family I really appreciate everything
65:07 that you've done you given me a huge
65:09 portfolio now I don't know where she is
65:11 I hope she's super successful but she at
65:15 18 I mean just imagine you at 18 you
65:17 know most of us were way past that age
65:19 we look back and some of us really had a
65:22 huge grasp of what life could be and but
65:24 most of us don't you know especially in
65:27 the area of believing in yourself
65:28 because believing in herself really has
65:30 to do with your your group your parental
65:35 group around you or your influencers
65:36 right kuroh begun but the second one
65:40 that's very memorable for me was when I
65:42 started my own game company about
65:45 halfway through the ten-year run and I
65:48 went to my cousin's wedding in San Diego
65:51 I sat next to this couple and this
65:54 mother and I started talking and she
65:56 said my daughter's graduating from the
65:59 Academy of Art in San Francisco and
66:01 she's looking for her work I said oh
66:03 really
66:03 I said well you know I've got positions
66:06 open to my company especially for a good
66:08 artist
66:08 send her over okay a couple weeks later
66:11 she comes to my company and she had just
66:15 barely kind of AB din to digital art she
66:19 was a fine artist so she showed me a
66:21 bunch of paintings and I'm like yeah
66:22 that's not really it's great but it's
66:25 not what I need so keep showing me stuff
66:27 and she finally showed me her sketch
66:28 portfolio amazing Disney level sketch
66:33 art I think she works for Blizzard right
66:35 now but I had a project coming up an
66:40 internal game we were gonna make I said
66:42 I think you're perfect I've talked about
66:44 her in the past but she absolutely
66:47 nailed it
66:50 absolutely nailed it and in her mind I'm
66:53 sure it was going home every day going
66:55 holy crap I'm doing what I want to do
66:58 and I've just graduated college the
67:03 reason I'm giving you these examples is
67:05 that these are the kind of things that
67:07 you need to tell yourself you need a
67:10 reality distortion field around yourself
67:12 but it's got to be on a solid foundation
67:15 okay if your dedication to what it is
67:18 that is your skill set when it comes to
67:23 dreams in reality hmm what rules are
67:26 there I'm not sure there are any I think
67:30 we're trying to write that book right
67:31 now all of this content in this episode
67:37 is the essentially the creative theme
67:40 your perception theme and your paradigm
67:43 theme of how you grasp but what you're
67:46 capable of doing from a professional
67:48 realm all the way back to the more
67:50 esoteric what reality am i in for those
67:55 of you who are deep rooted flutters
67:58 believers I think you have something
68:00 very interesting again for I went on it
68:04 you know that binge on that for at least
68:06 four months and there was again that
68:08 time I was walking down by Crystal Cove
68:10 on the beach
68:11 with my girlfriend and I looked up at
68:13 the sky and I thought I felt the dome
68:16 you know I felt the firmament dome I
68:18 don't know who was God base dome or
68:19 whatever I'm lucky this thing on Wow
68:21 it could be it could be isn't that
68:24 amazing
68:25 it's a paradigm shift in my brain if it
68:27 were right but for those of you who are
68:29 devout believers when you go outside and
68:32 you look up I'm relying on you guys to
68:35 have a completely different like mega
68:38 epiphany of what this reality is even if
68:41 you're wrong doesn't matter that's a
68:44 skill set that some might call you know
68:47 like what is it um Johnny Depp in the
68:51 movie Don Juan
68:53 he thought he was Don Juan he was
68:55 impersonating this character giving sort
68:57 of a gigolo who played Don Juan
68:59 like the real Don Juan and they
69:02 eventually gave him a drug I think in
69:03 the third act to make him give up sort
69:08 of sedated him in a way he couldn't have
69:10 his imagination destroying his reality
69:12 distortion field he was adhering to a do
69:15 no harm
69:16 regimen I think and let me give you one
69:20 more sort of esoteric example or theme
69:24 of examples before we close up I've
69:29 mentioned in recent episodes the fact
69:32 that a lot of times a I was gonna say
69:39 crimes because the one I'm thinking
69:41 about is the one where when when banks
69:44 went from analog to digital
69:47 they obviously started relying on
69:50 computers to take care of the ledgers
69:52 and when it all got situated between the
69:56 banks the Triple DES encryption allowed
69:59 them to communicate between each other
70:00 and I say I'm Bank a your bank B I'm
70:03 gonna give you some money I'm gonna
70:05 process I don't know banking fees or
70:07 whatever these guys stole a fraction of
70:10 a cent and put it in a separate account
70:13 banks didn't notice it for a long time
70:15 until this one account just started
70:17 accumulating hundreds of thousands of
70:18 dollars without any real depositor
70:21 showing up to give it money so
70:23 eventually a lot of them got busted but
70:26 think about it it was this little tiny
70:28 thing who someone started noticing and
70:31 they manifested their attention on it
70:34 and eventually got it to a point where
70:37 it became something very active in their
70:41 brain and then they hatched the scheme
70:43 on top of that little tiny thing to then
70:45 create a whole new reality for
70:48 themselves which is a bank account full
70:49 of cash right how many times in our
70:52 personal life have we had these
70:54 situations where you live in a normal
70:55 life and there's a little something a
70:58 little something that is in your life
71:01 that you barely notice it at first then
71:05 you start noticing a lot more and then
71:07 you're like whoa this is something that
71:10 I think I'd like to do for a living
71:12 a lot of people become chefs become
71:15 cooks because they they always you know
71:19 that you know you never told when you're
71:21 a kid you're gonna be a chef usually by
71:23 your parents or whatever it's usually
71:25 for the culinary experts they have a
71:28 very focused drive on that particular
71:30 thing but a lot of folks in all
71:33 countries all around the planet they
71:35 become chefs they start their own
71:37 restaurants what have you because they
71:39 realize that they always paid attention
71:41 to the recipes and their family then
71:43 they started paying attention to recipes
71:45 outside then they started gaining food
71:47 theory this is too salty this is too
71:50 sweet you know when I added a little bit
71:52 of this and that to it little citrus
71:54 lime it tasted better boom a career pops
71:59 out of nowhere because of that little
72:02 tiny snowball to start rolling down the
72:03 hill right when I start mentoring
72:09 someone on their career on their life
72:12 which doesn't happen very often but it
72:14 happens typically I tell them look we'll
72:18 have as many sessions as it takes for
72:21 you to find what you love in life right
72:23 and after season one has a lot of this
72:26 in the self-improvement area right
72:27 lament a detail what I do with folks but
72:30 there's a episode of thing called how to
72:32 get a job and for anyone who wants to
72:35 transition your career into something
72:37 that you love versus something that
72:38 you're doing go grab that episode but
72:42 one of the things I just focus on with
72:44 people is what makes you tick as a human
72:48 being you like to give do you like to
72:49 take do you like to entertain do you
72:51 like to spectate do you like to critique
72:53 versus create once you find whatever it
72:58 is the core theme of your being what is
73:00 your purpose on this planet then the
73:03 careers that suck for you immediately
73:05 show up in red and the careers that you
73:07 love show up in green you know to do a
73:10 traffic light analogy when you're
73:13 grasping reality this is the mechanism
73:16 in my opinion we tend to have a more
73:21 existential goal with the content in
73:24 this show
73:25 from the shape of the planet your
73:28 existence to maybe a matrix example to
73:31 whether or not we have divine creation
73:32 or evolution all these paradigms are
73:35 very limiting or very expansive let see
73:39 the limitless or it's it's either
73:42 infinite or finite right we all need to
73:46 make a decision before ourselves
73:48 personally what we're willing to accept
73:51 we overlay our bias on top of those
73:54 things what's important what's not
73:55 important
73:56 at times in my life for instance I've
73:58 made a lot of music I had been music in
74:01 a really long time it's a real bummer
74:03 I should just crap out music for all
74:06 kinds of different projects and so I've
74:10 always had that bug in me of like man
74:12 should I really try to work on like
74:15 right now my big thing is vocals I love
74:17 singing it's cool I do really powerful
74:19 vocal stuff okay so for me I thought
74:23 well I've got a few more years or my
74:26 look will work
74:27 I could definitely pound it out I need
74:29 to definitely increase my endurance yes
74:32 I could sing 20 songs or 30 songs with
74:34 maybe two breaks for a particular
74:36 evening but the more I started meeting
74:38 my buddies in the rock industry looking
74:41 at their lives and the grind that they
74:42 go through I sort of made a decision
74:46 where it's like that looks fun but I
74:49 don't know if I have the time or I'm
74:52 willing to make the sacrifice in my life
74:54 that that is required for that talent to
74:57 really hit professional levels in all
75:00 areas I should say right like I have
75:02 songs I've really built for and song as
75:04 I'm not built for but they're really
75:05 popular and you have to sing if you're
75:06 gonna do a bunch of cover stuff right
75:09 could write my own stuff but then that's
75:11 a huge endeavor in itself right
75:15 you know just watching the bands from
75:16 the 80s try to stay together oh my god
75:19 that's a nightmare into itself so I
75:23 opted out I opted out but it was a very
75:27 meticulous process before I made the
75:31 decision to do that
75:33 I think everybody needs to do that with
75:36 everything that you you have on your
75:37 list some of you are lucky you only have
75:40 one thing on your list some of us are
75:41 cursed with like 10 things on our list
75:43 10 things that we know that we could be
75:45 experts at if we just applied ourselves
75:47 so you look at your life you look at
75:49 your cycle we look at your age so get
75:51 your energy levels you look at the
75:54 longevity of what you would be doing
75:56 like if I started now what am I gonna
75:59 have ten years of that and then it's
76:00 over I hope to live a lot more than ten
76:02 more years of my life so I'm investing
76:04 in things that are going to reward me
76:07 until I die right careers that I'll
76:09 literally die at my desk doing that's a
76:13 success for me no matter when I croak
76:14 right I think that's about it hopefully
76:16 this was valuable to you guys how do we
76:21 grasp reality give it some thought you
76:25 know interested in your comments and one
76:28 of the things I mentioned this episode
76:29 that rings true with your own personal
76:31 experiences if you have your own reality
76:33 distortion field you've had success I
76:35 think that would be really good for
76:37 everyone else to hear and don't be
76:40 bashful about big comments like long
76:43 comments you know you got some folks
76:45 that have really invested some they've
76:48 like short one page essays that are just
76:50 phenomenal you read them you're so much
76:52 more enlightened when you get done so
76:53 don't be bashful throw it out there
76:57 anyhow if you have been to deep thoughts
76:59 radio calm please go audio/video lock
77:01 Facebook group patreon page take care of
77:04 yourself and someone else then I'll see
