00:29 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to G
00:31 thoughts starting to warm up now very
00:36 happy even though I'm bundled up it's
00:38 not bad out here alright I hope you guys
00:41 are doing well wherever you are in this
00:45 planet so a friend of mine every time I
00:50 have a conversation with her she will
00:53 say the world is run by Psychopaths or
00:56 she'll say something like I can't
00:58 believe the world is run by Psychopaths
01:01 and what's interesting is I don't
01:03 usually use that word in my mind but I
01:07 agree with it every time she says it
01:09 I was watching Westworld the new season
01:12 3 which in my opinion is another 10 it's
01:18 very detailed but it is I think this
01:24 won't be a major spoiling alert if you
01:28 know anything about Westworld if you
01:30 watch the first five minutes of you know
01:31 that there are these sort of Android
01:34 humans which are called hosts and then
01:37 there are real humans that go visit the
01:39 hosts and first season was all about the
01:41 drama going down in inside the western
01:44 West world in season 3 there's a
01:49 different thing happening where the
01:52 hosts are off on a mission let's just
01:55 put that way this won't ruin anything
01:57 for you at all and it's starting to turn
02:01 into a beautifully detailed Blade Runner
02:04 where I mean this is my pitch to you to
02:07 watch season 3 because they there's a
02:10 line spoken I think in episode 5 today
02:13 which is catalyzing my mind for this
02:15 episode believe it or not in Blade
02:20 Runner we saw four replicants which for
02:25 androids for replicants that were coming
02:30 back to earth
02:31 to find their maker who's dr. Tyrell and
02:36 we saw them engage
02:38 in various activities trying to get
02:40 closer and closer to this man but we
02:43 never really heard much of the dialogue
02:45 between the two of them and how they
02:47 were thinking there was a little bit of
02:48 Roy Roy and Leon because Leon was
02:53 supposed to go back to his apartment
02:53 grab his pictures then there was a recap
02:57 from Roy to Priss at Sebastian's
03:00 apartment you heard a couple lines there
03:02 but the rest was all assumed I guess
03:06 they guessed they were thinking this I
03:07 guess they were gonna do that and so one
03:11 of the cool things about Westworld
03:13 season three is that we are seeing a
03:15 much more detailed version of Blade
03:18 Runner in a very polite way and we're
03:22 getting to hear and see the rationale of
03:26 very sophisticated hosts discuss things
03:32 now we'll see the season 3 is not
03:34 something you're just gonna be able to
03:36 sit down and mess around in your front
03:38 room and get the show you need to put
03:40 everything down and watch it I'm
03:43 watching every episode three times
03:45 because I have three collections of
03:46 friends actually sorry two collections
03:48 of friends and I typically watch it once
03:49 by myself but in this episode I saw this
03:54 evening there's a character which I'll
03:59 let you discover who is lecturing
04:04 another person about the sort of the
04:09 generalization and the summation of
04:11 mankind one of the things that they talk
04:15 about which I've mentioned in several
04:16 shows is that they mentioned the loops a
04:19 loop is simply us getting up in the
04:22 morning doing a ritual going back to bed
04:26 and getting up in the morning and doing
04:28 it again we know we all do it we know we
04:32 do that particular loopy thing but the
04:35 beautiful writing in this this season
04:38 and the kid from Breaking Bad's in it
04:40 and I think it's one of his best roles
04:43 he's ever done he's really just he's
04:46 able to be a whole new character I've
04:49 never seen before and I just think he's
04:51 knocking another Park it's
04:52 but this character in his lecture said
05:00 mankind isn't worth keeping around
05:02 because mankind continually repeats
05:06 history in a bad way it's as if mankind
05:09 cannot learn anything from history so it
05:12 keeps doing it over and over and over
05:14 again and that's sort of the foundation
05:20 of this episode
05:21 my friend is right and we've talked
05:26 about this several times by the way I'm
05:28 smoking a Rocky Patel decade box press
05:35 was very interesting and and it's it's
05:39 interesting because as you study history
05:41 you will find Psychopaths all over
05:44 history right
05:45 the predominant ones that are taught to
05:48 us as kids is any any psychopath that
05:51 argue with our Psychopaths right so if
05:54 you're in England it would be any
05:55 country that argued with your leaders if
05:57 you're in France Germany etc before
06:01 America you know was you know what one
06:06 is just a mess for the history books and
06:08 I will tell you that when schools were
06:10 better in the United States they still
06:13 did not teach us World War one in school
06:16 they taught you it happened but they
06:18 didn't teach you anything about why we
06:20 were there because they probably
06:21 couldn't figure it out you know I
06:23 couldn't figure out a good reason for
06:25 kids to latch onto with World War two we
06:28 had a much thicker storyline Hitler
06:31 Pearl Harbor against the Japanese so
06:35 it's pretty easy to get behind it North
06:37 Korean War not taught at all Vietnam War
06:40 sort of acknowledged but never in any
06:43 detail because we should have been there
06:45 and we didn't exactly win the war right
06:49 so that's what you get out of like basic
06:51 history in the United States when the
06:54 schools were good now I didn't go to
06:57 college to get history classes so I
06:59 don't know if that got I'm sure we got
07:01 much much better and I studied like the
07:02 Middle Ages and
07:04 you know my own personal travels I
07:07 studied them you know each apology and
07:10 of course we've talked about a lot of
07:11 things on the show unimportant right now
07:14 but when you grow up you learn about
07:16 people like Henry Kissinger these weird
07:20 individuals who have an arrogance that
07:24 is unbelievable but what's interesting
07:27 about these folks and I would say you
07:33 know Kissinger is more of a sociopath in
07:35 my opinion who believes that he is
07:38 obviously way above you intellectually
07:42 and probably educational educationally
07:44 speaking in his prime Kissinger is
07:48 nothing to shake a stick at I mean their
07:50 IQs are off the chain we have to give
07:52 them that and if you underestimate their
07:53 IQ you lose Cheney's IQ huge Donald
07:58 Rumsfeld IQ huge these architects
08:01 there's something else men now they're
08:05 folks to get famous that don't have
08:07 necessarily massive IQs but they come
08:11 from families that have control and
08:12 there's where you get the Psychopaths
08:15 the Psychopaths you the sociopaths the
08:18 genius sociopaths to help them figure
08:20 out what to do but this character in
08:24 West world's saying that sort of
08:27 reminded me of the classic problem we
08:29 repeat history here's what I really
08:33 really really don't like about anyone
08:35 insulting the human race we know that
08:40 education is the way to get the human
08:42 race on the same page all become loving
08:45 individuals craft destinies I mean we
08:49 should be nothing more than a planet of
08:52 artistic expression you know if we
08:56 learned that there were alien forces
09:00 visiting earth and they son mean as well
09:03 some meanest harm and there's a need to
09:06 become defensive against that or maybe
09:08 even offensive about it then that's a
09:11 whole different conversation but as long
09:12 as we are
09:14 where we are and there are no other
09:17 players outside of ourselves then we
09:20 should be able to obliterate war because
09:24 every single crazy psychopathic person
09:27 what Genghis Khan Adolf Hitler Mao
09:32 Stalin I mean these people that are even
09:37 the list goes on and on I mean I would
09:39 bore you to death listing out the names
09:40 but these people that have super power
09:43 hungry appetites and philosophies that
09:46 they they get when they're really really
09:48 young remember the CERN had drawn
09:50 Collider one of the biggest problems
09:51 with that project is that the theories
09:55 that that designed it or conceived in
09:58 the 60s you know and we've come so far
10:02 since the 60s to be looking for the Big
10:04 Bang is a huge joke it didn't happen so
10:07 don't build a 30 billion euro machine
10:10 for looking at imaginary things which
10:16 begs most intelligent people to go there
10:19 looking for something else they're doing
10:20 something else but don't put it past
10:22 them to be that ignorant the ruling
10:26 class of this world keep us ignorant
10:28 they really really do they keep us in
10:33 the dark and fetus [ __ ] right just
10:35 like a mushroom so when someone says
10:40 let's just say you're in a more modern
10:42 sector of the world and you see slums
10:46 and some country like that the toughest
10:50 one to see when you're in the first
10:51 world country is the third world
10:54 countries and believe me they're almost
10:57 of all races I would say I only say
11:00 almost because I don't know the absolute
11:02 fact is I'm sitting here talking to you
11:04 but there's regions of the world where
11:06 one they live on the most lush beautiful
11:10 land earth has created and instead of
11:13 embracing that they throw all their
11:16 trash into a river and when I say all
11:19 their trash you guys have seen it metric
11:23 tons of trash to the point where the
11:25 rivers are full of trash
11:27 like probably two or three feet deep if
11:30 you fall into it you typically drowned
11:32 because the the the trash buries you how
11:37 can that be right
11:40 how can that be anywhere in the world
11:41 every country has billions of dollars
11:44 every country has billions of dollars
11:46 even the most desolate remote countries
11:50 will have the equivalent of a billion
11:53 dollars in their currency but the
11:55 psychopaths eat it all up don't they
11:59 there's this big hoorah
12:02 today today my today was the 14th
12:07 yesterday because it's the 15th it's the
12:10 morning of the 15th right now I've been
12:14 washing you know that well the thing is
12:16 that Trump decided to defund aside of
12:18 the globalist association with the World
12:22 Health Organization which is the best
12:24 news you have ever heard in your life if
12:26 you know anything about these ridiculous
12:28 organizations we give them five hundred
12:30 million dollars a year China gives them
12:32 40 million a year but what do you need
12:35 500 million dollars for World Health
12:37 Organization if there's no pandemic
12:40 they're doing nothing and let me give
12:44 you an example as you know I've been
12:48 watching tons of documentaries lately
12:50 even before the Lockean thing which is
12:52 not changing my life at all I mean at
12:54 all I have seen textile factories in
13:00 Indonesia polluting the water with
13:02 absolutely lethal amounts of all kinds
13:05 of ridiculous chemicals I have seen you
13:11 know there's a series on TV called trash
13:12 appleís the amount of waste products
13:15 we're creating is ridiculous I'm
13:18 watching a series that goes through all
13:21 of the countries in Africa where
13:24 communities are trying to grow the most
13:26 lucrative product and they find out that
13:29 whatever they're lured into isn't
13:31 lucrative
13:33 people burning electronics to get at the
13:35 copper and wires and they're sitting
13:37 there smelling it all people digging for
13:40 10
13:40 and then having to use a mercury to push
13:45 it all together people digging for gold
13:48 and they're smelling mercury fumes and I
13:51 mean there is a catastrophe and every
13:54 third-world country you know India where
13:57 you're supposed to outsource all your
13:59 programming they have the slum Dogz I
14:01 mean the slums of India and then they
14:03 have the the trash problem Haiti has the
14:07 trash problem countries in South America
14:10 have the trash problem countries in
14:12 South America right now like Venezuela
14:14 and Brazil they're suffering horribly
14:18 for things that all that need all that
14:20 needs to happen is the World Health
14:22 Organization if it truly gave a crap
14:24 about any of us would go to these
14:26 countries and say look what do you need
14:28 to fix this stuff you got to get those
14:30 textile companies to filter their water
14:33 before you throw it into the river
14:35 people are bathing in that people using
14:37 it for drinking water look at all the
14:40 deformed children and mentally ill
14:42 children because of what you're doing
14:44 and there's one textile company in
14:46 Indonesia that actually filtered their
14:47 waters this old guy works for amuses
14:49 like this genius who just said yeah it's
14:52 easy to filter water he actually poured
14:53 some of it out and drank it right on
14:55 camera but it's because this is all a
15:00 game us repeating history is due to them
15:05 well excuse me let's rewind it's due to
15:08 us allowing them to be bigger than us in
15:11 our minds someone being someone being
15:14 addicted to being told what to do
15:17 thinking for yourself I don't know what
15:21 the deal is you know it's it's almost
15:22 like that when Steve Jobs was
15:26 interviewed I believe in 1994 on a sofa
15:28 and he was asked about Bill Gates and he
15:30 said he says well you're either born
15:32 with style or you're not and Bill Gates
15:34 was not born with it so a man that was
15:37 an understatement so I'm I believe that
15:44 thinking for yourself isn't something
15:46 you're either born with or not born with
15:48 but we do have to teach it and because
15:53 the world is so broken these boom and
15:56 bust cycles that they create they just
15:57 created one right they just created one
16:01 they're going to try and spin this whole
16:04 Corona thing into the worst recession
16:06 we've had since the depression the IMF
16:09 came out and just simply said and and if
16:12 anyone allows their words to become
16:14 reality in their life then we're doing
16:17 it all over again we're about to repeat
16:19 history so I am talking about in this
16:25 episode sort of a problem that is so
16:28 massive that it's like my old analogy
16:34 that I've given to you guys several
16:36 times which is when I used to work on
16:38 giant projects either by myself or at
16:42 work or both at the same time I had to
16:46 give myself a mind trick an analogy and
16:48 my brain too to explain how I was gonna
16:53 get up every day do the same thing over
16:55 again especially when you're working for
16:56 yourself you know what I think I get
16:59 told you guys when I was um about 23 I
17:03 started developing a product that I
17:06 finished when I was 24 and I sold a
17:09 bunch of fortune 1000 companies and it
17:11 was a very complex project and just my
17:17 my Manila pad you know that had all of
17:20 the all the things that I had to do all
17:25 the features that I had to add and then
17:26 all the bugs that I had found two
17:28 different sections it was eight pages
17:30 and I had to you know wake up every day
17:35 and kill them and kill the bugs and make
17:37 the features and then because I make
17:39 everything you know as clean and as
17:43 perfect as possible I mean my interfaces
17:46 are massaged to a level that it's like
17:48 wow this is so easy and it does so much
17:51 I love that feeling but when you look
17:53 into my code it also makes a coder have
17:56 sexual feelings because they're like oh
17:58 this is so clean man you know there's no
18:01 crap in this thing okay so my analogy to
18:04 myself I made up during that
18:06 was chopping down a redwood tree with a
18:08 hatchet now no one should talk chop down
18:12 redwood trees the what isn't good for
18:13 anything this problem is sort of like
18:18 that it is so large and so
18:20 multi-dimensional that we have to have
18:25 the courage to have a really good
18:28 conversation about it and not just say
18:30 well you know everybody's kept [ __ ]
18:33 and and therefore history repeats itself
18:36 and okay you know if we were to agree
18:41 just those of you listening to me
18:45 that this is an issue that education is
18:47 a big giant issue then what we have to
18:52 do is in my opinion because we don't
18:55 believe this works but it does work we
18:58 have to spread the conversation with
19:01 very good touch points with an actual
19:04 feeling of a beginning middle and into
19:06 the problem such that someone else
19:08 hearing us doesn't hear the hopelessness
19:10 or doesn't get to a point of
19:12 hopelessness in trying to address the
19:15 issue let's review what education can
19:21 fix in this world I mean like a
19:23 full-blown education I can tell you
19:26 right now K through 12 I can save a lot
19:29 of life's even K through eight can save
19:32 a lot of lives remember in the 1800s in
19:34 America your average person had an
19:37 eighth grade education and it wasn't
19:40 that they had stopped being educated
19:42 it's just that's how far the schools
19:43 went and so they'd stop and they'd go
19:46 off and become inventors the amount of
19:49 people without formal education z' that
19:51 have created amazing things is a lot
19:54 more than you would think
19:56 and of course those with advanced
20:00 education will also blow you away by
20:02 what they create so you know we've got a
20:06 few issues here right we have first
20:10 world countries that actually have
20:12 access although expensive education now
20:16 with YouTube and the internet I don't
20:17 know why anyone is in a raucous
20:19 if that's what they want to be because
20:21 I'm telling you everything is out there
20:23 everything is out there and just give
20:26 you an idea just a quick a little
20:27 analogy you don't taking my 3d skills to
20:31 the next level through this quarantine
20:32 phase and I bought four courses from
20:35 four professionals that made beautiful
20:37 courses and they are above and beyond
20:40 most free courses plus they're super
20:44 duper professionals and so when you're
20:46 listening to them they actually have the
20:48 job that you want and that's what I
20:49 typically do is listen to people that
20:51 have the jobs that I want you know I
20:53 take from them what I like but I go on
20:59 YouTube when I don't have a very
21:01 specific thing that I that's covered in
21:03 any of my courses and there's the video
21:05 right there maybe at worst I have to
21:08 listen to someone with thick accent
21:09 maybe even if they're speaking in a
21:11 completely different language and it
21:13 isn't translated you can just mute it
21:16 and watch where the cursor goes right
21:17 and watch so the mouse goes and you're
21:19 like oh okay that's the modifier are use
21:21 that's how I work the physics engine or
21:23 whatever but population control for
21:27 instance is something that is being used
21:29 against us again for my experiences in
21:35 terms of listening to friends of mine
21:36 who have literally presented to
21:37 Rothchilds personally it is something
21:40 that they truly believe is a problem
21:43 again the world's not currently
21:47 suffering a population problem they're
21:49 concerned about the curve which is
21:51 skyrocketing straight up and there are
21:54 you know different elements to
21:56 population growth if you have a poor
21:58 society that can they can't support
22:00 their current population then any
22:02 increase in that population is going to
22:04 be unquestionably a bad thing for them
22:07 it's going to increase poverty for them
22:09 for countries for other countries they
22:13 are literally trying to take over the
22:14 world through a population growth with a
22:20 defense mechanism if you recognize the
22:22 fact that they are trying to take over
22:23 the world and snatch the whole place up
22:27 then your racists and they use the race
22:29 card to prevent you from criticizing
22:31 their side
22:32 war against the rest of humanity all
22:35 right and then as just sort of a blanket
22:40 theory we do have to control how many
22:43 people we put on this planet just go
22:44 look at the 405 on a Tuesday morning at
22:47 nine o'clock and you will realize we've
22:50 got too many people for the
22:52 infrastructure that we have
22:54 infrastructure takes a really long time
22:56 to design implement pay for and so it'd
23:01 be really nice if it was more like you
23:03 know eighty five instead of twenty
23:04 twenty so we know that education in
23:09 terms of giving someone a career path
23:12 starts as soon as your kid can recognize
23:15 spoken language whatever language you
23:18 natively speak this is the kid gets the
23:20 question what are you gonna be when you
23:22 grow up and they're like whoa no you're
23:25 asking me an adult question because
23:26 that's what that question is I'm asking
23:28 you to tell me what you're gonna toot
23:29 when you become an adult and the kids
23:31 five years old so the only thing that
23:34 they answer with our options that have
23:37 been presented to them again when I was
23:40 a little kid the funny thing was you
23:42 were either gonna be like a boy would be
23:45 a doctor or a fireman or whatever a
23:50 woman I think the answers were were like
23:53 a nurse or something like that the kind
23:57 of remedial but those were concepts the
23:59 kids could understand it wasn't like
24:00 that was a limitation but obviously
24:05 education will give someone a destiny
24:07 and once they have a destiny then
24:09 everything else is pitted against the
24:11 destiny now there's a little bit of
24:13 narcissism that can happen there and you
24:17 can be a bad parent or whatever so we
24:21 you know education is a part of that
24:22 solution as well but overall it gets a
24:24 female to think about how many kids can
24:28 I have and still have this destiny of
24:32 mine
24:32 meaning hers to realize because if you
24:36 think about it as I've told you you know
24:38 in the simulations we did in video games
24:41 men typically could run away from
24:44 getting someone pregnant
24:45 and that is reprehensible behavior the
24:51 woman can't run away it's inside of her
24:54 and she develops bonds typically
24:57 typically but out of all of the videos
25:02 that I have seen and there are just so
25:04 many videos of you know third-world
25:08 countries you really should watch some
25:10 of these to really get a good global
25:12 view of how the world works you don't
25:13 have to listen to the narration of the
25:15 documentary as much because they're
25:18 definitely traveling with biases at
25:20 times there's a lot of global warming
25:21 climate change crap in there but it'll
25:26 give you a sense of you know where to
25:29 point education and the thing is is that
25:31 for those of us in first world countries
25:33 what are you gonna do you know you may
25:36 think okay I want to support education
25:39 in these third-world countries but how
25:41 you gonna do it it's very very difficult
25:43 because it's gonna take a tremendous
25:45 amount of money these teachers have to
25:48 speak at least two languages and you
25:50 know if you're in America learning how
25:53 to speak some local say Ugandan language
25:58 or what have you they do speak French a
26:00 lot of times and they all have a little
26:02 bit of broken English at one point but
26:03 to be a teacher you're gonna have to you
26:05 know communicate in a native tongue but
26:08 all of this is just sort of anecdotal
26:11 because it is it seems insurmountable on
26:17 point but now let me just so we saw that
26:22 was a manual way of fixing the problem
26:24 which will work which is for us to
26:26 somehow subsidize education towards the
26:31 third-world countries that are
26:32 struggling or countries like Brazil that
26:35 we're doing fine and now they're doing
26:37 horrible Venezuela was doing fine now
26:38 it's doing horrible India I don't see an
26:42 excuse why they can't provide more than
26:45 12 bathrooms in a city with 10 million
26:47 people I mean they've got horrendous
26:50 problems that are super easy to solve
26:52 the biggest cities in India have
26:54 restroom problems well how hard is a
26:57 restroom in and
26:59 can you get a pipe to move water or then
27:01 we can move poop through a pipe but for
27:06 whatever reason you know there there
27:09 have to be some sort of corrupt elements
27:11 at the top of government not to fund
27:13 this stuff they don't even pass laws
27:16 about polluting the world it's their
27:19 world it's not our world okay so that
27:23 one's very meticulous very tough now let
27:28 me ask you this question if we could
27:31 truly spread the realization that
27:34 Psychopaths are the ones that gravitate
27:37 towards government positions and
27:40 corporate positions and banking
27:41 positions we could get that understood
27:45 and we could get it to stop which is a
27:48 big big order guess who's gonna fill the
27:52 position now some industries simply
27:56 shouldn't exist banking should have
27:58 never been allowed to be a private
28:00 for-profit situation because like all
28:04 things in most first world countries if
28:07 the resource that you are consuming is a
28:09 strategic resource water food
28:12 electricity heating money then it has to
28:18 be regulated in a very special way
28:21 there can't be ridiculous profit there
28:25 can't there shouldn't be any profit this
28:29 is what you have to do to store your
28:32 calorie energy that you expel into
28:35 monetary units such that you can get the
28:37 other strategic resources and pay for
28:39 them now things cost money to make food
28:42 costs money to make water cost money to
28:44 purify electricity cost money to
28:45 generate again if Tesla was around we
28:48 could at least erase electricity off
28:50 there but even Tesla's infrastructure
28:52 would have cost money and it's gonna
28:54 cost maintenance right you build a bunch
28:56 of these Tesla towers around the world
28:59 well you have to build them they're very
29:02 delicate you know mechanical devices or
29:06 electronic devices and then you know
29:09 tornado comes by and knocks out some of
29:11 the repeater antennas to move
29:12 electricity from one point to the other
29:15 you got to fix it so not everything is
29:18 completely free but it's a hell of a lot
29:20 cheaper than we're paying for right now
29:21 just the fact that we have you know
29:25 gasoline is the strategic resource for
29:28 the United States of America but because
29:31 the oil industry owns the power of every
29:33 fiat currency you're not allowed to tell
29:37 them anything gas in Tennessee right now
29:42 I believe is a buck thirty a gallon
29:45 which is I mean God that is like as
29:47 cheap as when I moved to California
29:50 thirty-three years ago in fact I think
29:54 we hit $2 within the first three years I
29:56 was here okay
29:59 well that same gasoline in a normal
30:01 economy without the lockdown without
30:04 Donald Trump as president would run five
30:06 bucks a gallon in Santa Monica
30:08 California why because the oil industry
30:11 knows that Santa Monica has a lot of
30:13 money and no one will complain but you
30:16 know it's kind of ridiculous or
30:18 completely ridiculous is that that oil
30:20 is actually refined in California and
30:22 has a shorter distance to travel to go
30:27 from the refineries to the pumps in
30:30 Santa Monica
30:30 it cost us a ton of money to deliver
30:32 1,800 miles inland to put in that tank
30:35 probably more than at 2,000 miles in
30:38 Tennessee and it sells for cheaper
30:42 Psychopaths around the world Psychopaths
30:45 get what they want because they
30:48 gravitate to the positions if we could
30:53 ever drain the swamps and every industry
30:55 first your politicians but you really
30:59 have to pay attention to what the
31:01 Rothschilds said in the 1800s the
31:02 beautiful thing about the Rothschilds is
31:04 they got so arrogant in 1800s they
31:06 talked a lot they told us how much money
31:08 they had they tell us how they do their
31:10 operations which is if I control the
31:12 money I care not who casts a vote
31:14 because I'll control who you vote for
31:18 okay
31:20 we have to annihilate the banking cartel
31:23 by outline banks from being private
31:27 for-profit devices it's not like health
31:31 care right health care requires a
31:33 tremendous apparatus of you know
31:37 cooperating bodies imagine just getting
31:40 a regular surgery how many people have
31:42 to be in that room you have disciplines
31:44 up to PhD levels or close to tend to
31:49 your body as you're being put under by
31:51 the anesthesiologist the surgeon that's
31:54 going in the second surgeon going in the
31:56 nurses that are helping the surgeons
31:58 it's a it's a very detailed thing and
32:01 you have to be very careful with that
32:03 going into the government sector because
32:09 traditionally and I don't know why I
32:11 think it's because the the pay rates are
32:13 so low we don't get top in professionals
32:15 in government positions now when I
32:19 worked for the college here locally it
32:22 was repulsive how the employees some
32:28 some employees I should say behave on a
32:30 daily basis when the bell rang at five
32:33 o'clock
32:33 there was no Bell but when it became
32:36 five o'clock all the employees
32:38 disappeared there was no concept of
32:41 working harder to get something done it
32:44 was so bad that if I was at my desk as a
32:47 contractor I only went in up you know
32:49 about of three days a week tops and I
32:52 went to the restroom because I didn't
32:54 have the key to the front door I would
32:57 have to time it you know I was like oh
32:59 my god I can't be in there at five
33:01 o'clock as I'll come back on all my
33:02 stuff's locked away and everyone's gone
33:05 I mean everyone I was in an office with
33:07 probably 20 people all 20 people gone
33:10 the place shut down and that's not
33:13 necessarily in the world but that gives
33:15 you an idea of how inflexible government
33:18 you know brain bodies are but a banking
33:20 system should be largely computerized
33:22 for one thing and so you just need
33:25 tellers here and there again your
33:27 candling all the money of your country
33:29 there should be no problem providing
33:31 decent salary
33:32 for tellers and bank managers and
33:34 whatever but they're going to be
33:35 answering to the state or the city the
33:37 federal government not the state to make
33:39 sure that when you borrow money there's
33:41 a fee for borrowing money but not this
33:45 compound interest thing right now I
33:48 don't know about every other country's
33:50 mechanisms and infrastructure for how
33:54 your money system is created and
33:57 distributed I assume it's very close to
33:58 the United States if you're using fiat
34:00 currency which is like sort of a
34:03 byproduct of the World Bank right but
34:06 the rothschild said that little
34:09 statement about controlling the money
34:10 and they control the world so if we were
34:13 to take back and there's this big rumor
34:16 that we've done it but if we take back
34:17 the control of the Federal Reserve
34:19 dissolve it replace their notes with
34:23 Treasury notes back it by gold then who
34:27 can manipulate us anymore banks in
34:30 Europe hmm maybe what are you gonna do
34:34 sit in New York City and deal in Euros
34:35 all day long
34:36 I think someone would notice that you
34:39 don't have any real cash all these
34:44 investment banking houses which are
34:46 awarded freshly created money that then
34:49 are distributed to corporations via
34:51 stock purchase purchases to keep their
34:55 evil corporations on top and you can't
34:57 create any competing business down below
34:59 would be erased eventually if you can't
35:04 find them in direct crimes to then
35:06 immediately shut them down so imagine us
35:08 taking keep taking control of our own
35:10 money and all that shady [ __ ] that they
35:14 do you just put one lawsuit Aman lawsuit
35:16 on them after another in such a way that
35:19 you lock up all their money on the first
35:21 day of the indictment but we'll see you
35:24 will see where your money goes after
35:25 this court case is over but all of your
35:28 personal assets as relates to the
35:31 company are all frozen maybe even some
35:34 of the you know veiled the leadership
35:37 meaning they're behind the corporate
35:38 veil I mean they their own boats and
35:41 houses and mansions and things are
35:43 protected up to a point but when you
35:45 behave in such a corrupt way
35:46 the court has a way of piercing the
35:48 corporate veil and they could seize a
35:50 CEOs entire state the idea that there
35:55 are big giant investment firms is sort
36:00 of ridiculous big giant companies that
36:04 decide who wins and who fails well now
36:07 if you were to revise banking by making
36:10 your own treasury sovereign note then
36:13 they wouldn't have this ultimate
36:14 relationship with the bankers anymore
36:16 your politicians that are serving the
36:18 deep state because that money is power
36:21 and you can buy anyone off
36:23 well that just ends it just ends sure
36:26 they could get a bunch of euros
36:27 transferred for a little while but as
36:29 long as the conversion between a fiat
36:32 currency and a real currency is
36:33 extremely tough well one it's really
36:36 trackable - that's the other beautiful
36:38 thing it would end it would be it this
36:43 is literally the Achilles heel it is the
36:46 death blow to the entire problem one by
36:51 one you know again if America got out of
36:54 fiat currency and one our Treasury note
36:56 we become the most powerful country in
36:59 world history I mean the most powerful
37:03 financial entity and once you have tons
37:06 of your own money and we bring all of
37:08 our jobs back to United States we no
37:10 longer senselessly get everything made
37:12 outside of our country and I think China
37:14 just did themselves in a big one
37:16 remember Japan spending two billion
37:18 dollars to bring everything back to
37:19 Japan Japan will be safe for putting
37:22 their corporations I mean their
37:23 manufacturing factories in the United
37:26 States they know no one's going to take
37:29 over the country I mean invade it plenty
37:32 of workers boom solution but then all
37:38 these investment banker banking houses
37:40 dry up but know what's gonna happen you
37:41 might think well they managed mutual
37:43 funds and a bunch of other things
37:44 investment portfolios and stuff okay
37:48 well how's that going for everybody it
37:52 really doesn't work that well those
37:55 agencies don't need to exist if all that
37:59 money the
38:00 billions and billions of dollars that
38:04 they have that they move around that
38:06 they lose all the time right if it was
38:08 in your pocket in my pocket well you
38:12 know a man only needs so much money to
38:14 have an absolutely perfect life I don't
38:17 know what it is but I'm willing to bet
38:20 someone in my hometown making $50,000 a
38:23 year is gonna live pretty good due to
38:25 the cost of living now who knows if we
38:28 were to take take back control of the
38:30 money and because oil and gasoline is a
38:33 strategic resource and we price fix that
38:35 and I know it's like Oh free market self
38:39 [ __ ] Crimea River man free market is
38:42 for a television company a computer
38:45 company a cell phone company they get
38:47 free market because you don't have to
38:49 have those things do you realize in New
38:52 York houses still run on oil heating
38:56 these big giant taker trucks drive down
38:59 residential neighborhoods these big
39:00 giant hoses and they go into homes and
39:02 they stick it in the front and they fill
39:03 your house with the fuel to keep your
39:06 house warm
39:08 another de Massachusetts the heating
39:11 system in our apartment was a water
39:14 system they had little it was like a
39:16 radiator but it was the water was
39:18 actually exposed to the air and it would
39:21 pour inside this thing and you'd hear
39:22 all these little metal things start
39:24 tinging and tonguing as they warmed up
39:26 and man it was amazing because once I
39:27 got warm it was really cheap it was just
39:30 heating water non-toxic man that's using
39:38 electricity at the same time but do I
39:41 need to remind you that hydroelectric
39:43 power plants were banned in 1973 because
39:46 the oil company lobbied the politicians
39:49 with their power so we don't make any
39:51 more clean energy no more dams well we
39:57 can turn that back on there's all kinds
40:00 of ways of generating electricity
40:01 extremely cheap we all know that so my
40:06 point from mentioning this overhaul of
40:08 first world countries
40:09 because let me go back to the beginning
40:11 problem we have at least two thirds of
40:16 the world living in variable levels of
40:20 poverty without any real civil rights
40:22 there are dozens of countries that live
40:25 in violent hellholes people that would
40:32 be good but can't be good because
40:34 they're starving and their brains don't
40:36 work well when you're starving and
40:37 they'll do they have to do whatever they
40:38 can to survive and because it's already
40:41 happening around them they just join the
40:44 gang so to speak and they beg steal and
40:47 all kinds of stuff but if every first
40:51 world country reset got rid of all the
40:56 control mechanisms that allow these
40:58 bankers to control the politicians with
41:02 the Psychopaths have a clear path
41:03 anymore I think not what I'm really
41:11 interested to see happen to see if it
41:13 happens is Donald Trump gets another
41:18 four years and continues I put it'll
41:22 calm down a little bit maybe not but he
41:25 continues with this more Occam's razor
41:29 brute force solution to age-old problems
41:33 right we've solved problems that are 70
41:36 years old
41:36 horrible issues and again this is the
41:41 way that society was when I was growing
41:44 up where all the males were very much
41:48 like him they're not mean unless you're
41:52 messing with the system unless you're
41:54 stealing from someone or betraying
41:56 someone then they get me but they're
42:00 also fair in the end all right they're
42:02 like they'll spank you and then it's
42:04 like you learned right okay give me a
42:06 hug
42:06 shake my hand whatever we got to do here
42:08 and go out there and make me proud of
42:10 you and then BOOM you go off to get
42:14 something going that's that's going to
42:16 make that individual proud it could be
42:18 your grandmother could be the lady next
42:20 door
42:21 everyone raised everybody else and there
42:26 were consequences for things I didn't
42:30 realize it at first but this whole thing
42:32 about not spanking your kids I thought
42:35 it was when I was a kid well when I
42:38 guess when I was in my 20s and I started
42:39 hearing this and of course I rolled my
42:41 eyes because they can I was made out of
42:45 the few times I had my butt smacked you
42:48 know it was to advance this agenda to
42:54 pusseh Phi the entire generation to make
42:58 sure that there was no level of
43:00 appreciation for anything you just do
43:02 whatever you want you heard someone else
43:04 well that's your problem
43:05 I sort of what all those kids turned
43:07 into now obviously there are parents
43:11 that don't understand the threshold of
43:13 how to do it which is why we have to
43:15 educate people how to do it in a non
43:18 harmful way meaning no physical body
43:20 harm necessarily like I watched my
43:23 friends literally had to watch to my
43:26 friends they were brothers and I went
43:28 over to spend the night and something
43:31 happened they were fighting and their
43:33 mom who was like a taller version of the
43:36 woman from poltergeist that cleaned the
43:38 house right she asked them well what
43:42 happens to you when you do this and they
43:44 were like oh you're gonna spank us with
43:46 the belt it was like I'm sitting over
43:49 this as the first time ever spent the
43:52 night and she literally beat the crap
43:54 out of him with this belt and you know
43:57 they hoot and hollered and what I'm
44:00 cried for a little bit and I was shocked
44:04 you know so there's definitely some
44:06 education as they go on in that area to
44:08 but we don't have any consequences for
44:10 anything anymore you just get to be a
44:12 big pain in the ass to society and
44:14 everyone's supposed to suck it up and I
44:16 think that's coming to an end
44:18 for this particular cycle of history but
44:23 how many of you have found it utterly
44:25 jaw-dropping that someone would want
44:26 socialism and then you look at all the
44:29 leaders in the world that are known as
44:31 the psychopath killers of the world and
44:34 its own socialism
44:35 was the first stage they went to and
44:37 then the gun grabbed and then all the
44:39 rights were gone and then it was show
44:41 your papers and then I was get on the
44:43 train then it was like even in Germany
44:46 you know they built a couple communities
44:48 in Germany before they got into major
44:50 trouble the rest of the world where
44:53 Hitler with had blond hair blue-eyed men
44:56 and women and they were expected to
44:58 breed to increase the population whoa
45:03 imagine you were eighteen years or older
45:07 in Germany during the war you think you
45:09 had a choice of what your career was no
45:12 so grab that mp40 but that outfit on and
45:16 you know go learn how to drive a tank
45:18 fly a plane shoot a rifle shoot a
45:20 machine gun and get out there and kill
45:24 someone in the name of the Fuhrer right
45:30 but the lack of education allows for
45:35 this notion that every country on planet
45:37 Earth it's a calm is the socialistic
45:39 country is the nemesis of everybody else
45:42 member North Korea is an axis of evil
45:44 they have concentration camps in North
45:46 Korea man for anybody who goes against
45:49 the country China has concentration
45:51 camps slash prisons where not only if
45:54 you are a Falun Gong follower or you
45:57 protest against the CCP you go to jail
46:00 and then they negotiate your organs to
46:04 millionaires around the world and they
46:07 cut you up it's just like that skit for
46:09 Monty Python back in the 70s where they
46:12 showed up to to get your organs because
46:16 you sign a donation card and they come
46:18 and get them before you die it's it's
46:23 atrocious another on the preferred human
46:28 rights council at the UN give me a break
46:35 now one thing I want to highlight in
46:38 your mind is that there's there's this
46:44 phenomenon that's happening with all of
46:46 us which is we wake up
46:49 because of random things that happen to
46:51 us right you see a documentary you have
46:54 a conversation with someone you see
46:56 something yourself and then you wake up
47:00 and depending on what year you woke up
47:03 what kind of family and friends you have
47:07 you either have people that are gonna
47:09 wake up with you because you communicate
47:11 with them or you're gonna have to reach
47:13 out to new friends and you find this
47:15 group now the first anxiety that you
47:18 have when you wake up is that you're
47:20 isolated immediately you're now seeing
47:23 how they work you're excited but you're
47:27 also a little freaked out about it
47:30 depends on again what you're what
47:31 awakened to and the first goal is just
47:36 to find someone else to talk to which is
47:39 where online happens but then you find
47:41 someone a real-life and it's ten times
47:43 as powerful to have a conversation with
47:45 another human being it also has a
47:48 boatload of information you don't have
47:51 typically you'll find someone who's
47:53 typically a little bit more awake than
47:56 you in some areas then maybe you're more
47:59 awake in other areas but here's the
48:02 here's the challenge for us because
48:05 Awakening is part of a resistance to
48:10 repeating history we get too satisfied
48:15 with our small little group but we don't
48:19 continue reaching out to wake people up
48:23 now some of us at times have tried to
48:26 wake people up with social media and
48:29 that is definitely effective and but it
48:37 can damage more than it fixes sometimes
48:40 and sometimes you can initially have the
48:41 opinion will screw everybody it doesn't
48:43 want to listen to me I don't want them
48:45 in my life if they don't listen to me
48:47 because this stuff is important and the
48:50 challenge there is that in reality it
48:54 might just be what you presented was a
48:56 little too heavy for them or a little
48:57 too complex for them and they will wake
49:00 up it's just you have to know them
49:02 personally
49:02 and go okay what what do you think about
49:05 this what do you think about that you
49:06 kind of get a little sense of what
49:08 they're most likely to adjust next like
49:13 one of the simple conversations that you
49:16 probably have with other people is when
49:19 especially if you're in America let me
49:20 just say that I would like to hear a
49:23 European version or other country
49:26 version of what I'm about to say and how
49:28 you say it to your folks we have the
49:30 Federal Reserve here right mention that
49:31 all the time so one of the icebreakers
49:34 is well did you did you know that the
49:37 Federal Reserve is not federal I mean I
49:39 thought it was federal because there's
49:40 the name federally but it's not it's
49:42 actually a private for-profit bank and
49:45 80% of the members are actually
49:47 forbidden for us to know who they are
49:51 did you know that I didn't know that you
49:53 know and you might even play super
49:55 stupid like you just learned it
49:57 yesterday to regress yourself back to
49:59 their level so the conversation is like
50:03 stepping off on the moon surface right
50:07 it's not you know flying through space
50:10 and trying to land on the thing it's
50:12 just that's just one more step you
50:14 haven't taken yet is to take that one
50:15 step then they're gonna be a little
50:16 addictive too like you know and then I
50:19 found out but Bob you know the dollar is
50:21 actually only valued by the cell the
50:23 barrel of oil I thought it was gold back
50:25 but it turns out you know Nixon took us
50:27 completely off the gold standard in 73
50:29 but you know I was thinking about it and
50:31 the depression Teddy Roosevelt I mean
50:33 sorry Theodore Roosevelt took all the
50:34 gold for everybody shipped it to Fort
50:36 Knox so it kind of means we have crappy
50:39 money it's really weird you know I've
50:41 seen a dollar and you pull it out you
50:42 flip it over says Federal Reserve Note
50:44 on it and you start blowing people's
50:45 minds you regress down to their level to
50:49 give them a chance it's the same way we
50:52 talk to little kids and it's not to be
50:54 demeaning or anything it's just to make
50:57 it accessible you know the word
50:59 accessible isn't used enough in society
51:01 in my opinion well we made video games
51:05 when I was making video games Electronic
51:07 Arts the word accessibility was always
51:09 used and I had never heard it used like
51:11 I'm about to describe it to you but now
51:13 it's like something I love to say which
51:15 is
51:16 are people gonna understand the game if
51:19 they're 12 15 25 35 45 if a game is
51:25 really easy like Tetris for instance had
51:28 a lot of accessibility oh you just kind
51:30 of learn the blocks drop and you got to
51:33 have enough space and they're shaped in
51:34 weird ways you gotta find the socket
51:36 that fits the block and there you go
51:38 Rubik's Cube totally accessible well
51:41 then that you could solve it or not was
51:42 a different thing but you get a game
51:46 like jeez Metal Gear Solid or something
51:51 and analysis and accessibility goes way
51:53 way down
51:54 fallout 4 way way down so when we
51:59 prepare information for people we have
52:02 to think about the accessibility of how
52:03 we're describing it's an individual
52:05 based on who you're talking to 85 year
52:08 old woman it's gonna be different than a
52:10 55 year old man than 12 year old kid and
52:15 you have to also think about their
52:16 priorities in life what do they care
52:18 about for kid is 16 to 18 you know
52:23 probably the the number one thing I
52:26 would tell a 16 year old kid boy girl
52:28 doesn't matter is its to have the Hobby
52:32 conversation and essentially say well
52:35 you know and when I was a kid you could
52:37 go to four-year college and you didn't
52:39 have to declare your major for the first
52:40 two years you did your AAA equivalent
52:43 inside the four-year and then you picked
52:45 your major because you potentially
52:48 walked in there with no knowledge about
52:50 anything and so you take a computer
52:51 science class should take a language
52:54 class whatever accounting class and you
52:56 find out that you have a propensity to
52:59 understand something and now they've
53:02 rigged ala for your colleges so that all
53:03 the kids fail pick what you want to be
53:06 in life at 18 years old with no
53:09 knowledge in anything so what I would
53:11 tell a 16 year old is like what do you
53:13 do to have fun and they listen to see if
53:18 there's a career and their current
53:19 choices if not you might say well you
53:22 know what you might want to do you know
53:24 don't stop doing those things that you
53:25 love to do because they're they're
53:27 awesome
53:27 even if they're not and you say
53:30 it's weed and you say you'd knock that
53:31 [ __ ] off and to get older and you just
53:34 say you know when I got to when I turned
53:37 18 I was a professional artist and I was
53:40 a professional computer scientist but I
53:44 also know how to fix electronics it was
53:46 you know decent mechanic for cars of
53:49 that era which is no longer the case
53:51 nowadays but you know just go through a
53:53 litany of things that I was good at
53:55 enough to then go into college and say
53:57 that's what I want to really know you
53:59 know and just get them to say see their
54:02 life and just say look and the way you
54:04 pitch it to them is sort of like when
54:07 you want to really kick ass in life let
54:08 me give you a little trick here I want
54:11 to just carve yourself out sometime try
54:15 to make it more and more everyday of
54:18 course if you love anything you carve
54:20 time out for it no matter what but just
54:22 go look pick a few things that lead to
54:26 careers and then when it comes time for
54:29 you to move out of your house cuz you
54:31 don't you want to get out of your
54:32 parents house oh yeah oh yeah but you
54:34 want to have your own place in your own
54:35 car oh yeah totally if total freedom
54:37 right that sounds awesome right yeah all
54:39 right well go find yourself something
54:42 that you love that's actually a career
54:45 in the real world get really good at it
54:47 cuz you have no bills are now right you
54:48 can tell you OD on this thing one if you
54:51 even start doing that your parents will
54:53 probably start treating a little bit
54:55 better and giving you a little more
54:56 leeway because you know they're they're
54:58 gonna have to their fear having to
55:00 support you is gonna be way way down
55:05 lean on them about scholarships say look
55:07 if you get really good at something you
55:10 can get a full ride at any college in
55:13 the world now a lot of kids get into
55:15 sports just as a small digression and
55:17 that can actually fuel the scholarship
55:20 that leads to the actual career right so
55:24 I've got a lot of friends of mine that
55:25 went to sports scholarships full-blown
55:27 scholarships man all paid for and they
55:31 didn't have good GPAs or anything but
55:33 they were good soccer players basketball
55:34 players football players and so they got
55:36 full rides but they ended up getting the
55:38 degree in something else right I think
55:42 humanity has been living in a
55:44 very serendipitous lifestyle meaning
55:47 everything is just happening to us we
55:49 don't engineer who we are as people
55:51 there's no sense of like you know
55:54 self-improvement you know the the 80s
55:58 here in America at least and you can
55:59 give me a different year for your
56:02 country if there is a different year or
56:04 decade I should say but that's where we
56:06 really had the self-help book explosion
56:10 at the book stores and it was you know
56:13 it was kind of like YouTube you would go
56:15 in there and go oh my god you look at
56:17 this self-help section you know there's
56:19 fufu ones that are really psychological
56:22 ones which are good too but there was a
56:25 lot of anything you wanted man I mean
56:29 how to learn algebra how to learn how to
56:31 fix a car how to do anything in the 90s
56:36 they started having these workshops
56:39 where you would actually go every few
56:43 days a week or even like again I can't
56:45 tell you how powerful workshops are my
56:51 old co-host Kyle I've said this a couple
56:53 times we're in a good spot to repeat
56:54 this here he was he was an is he's a
56:58 former punk rock rock star back in 89 he
57:02 had finally finished touring with dr.
57:04 Noah band he created you can look up dr.
57:07 neta on Wikipedia KN Oh W so Kyle's in
57:13 there and he gets done with that you
57:15 know and he just had he had dominated
57:17 for 10 years he toured it was amazing I
57:18 met him in her creative writing class he
57:20 was installing cable on telephone poles
57:25 right then he got a job being an isp
57:29 support guy so he's working an Internet
57:31 service provider and answering tech
57:33 calls which blew my mind cuz I didn't
57:35 know he had technical capabilities and
57:37 then he got tired of that and he was
57:40 like okay I got a job so I got my bills
57:42 paid now I gotta go find out what I
57:44 really want to do but what he was doing
57:46 he got a copy of poser and Bryce poser
57:50 was a 3d modeling application that will
57:52 allow you to pose humans and then Bryce
57:55 was you could create these incredible
57:57 canyons and stuff in 3d but you could
58:00 import pose her into Bryce so he started
58:04 creating all these amazing renderings I
58:07 named one of my companies after one of
58:09 his renderings okay
58:11 he then enrolls in a workshop in Burbank
58:15 California living in Ventura which that
58:17 drive is probably an hour to half with
58:19 no traffic one way he drives into LA
58:24 Burbank every weekend for I think six
58:28 weeks or something like that
58:29 he makes a demo reel of a spaceship
58:32 situation and like I said he took it to
58:38 a special-effects house that was doing
58:39 Babylon 5 the guy said that's pretty
58:41 good but go back and make these changes
58:42 he then he has access to the workshop
58:45 computers he does that again for another
58:47 three months renders our brand-new real
58:51 takes it to the dude gets the job and 25
58:56 years later he's got two Emmys for
58:58 special effects so what we are allowed
59:02 to do now in terms of improving
59:04 ourselves is phenomenal and here's the
59:07 funny thing everything he drove into
59:09 Burbank to get is in it is without
59:13 exaggeration probably 10,000 times the
59:15 education is at your fingertips on
59:18 YouTube to learn anything you want you
59:21 want to learn how to be a plumber you're
59:23 gonna have to get certified to do that
59:24 but you could pretty much learn all your
59:26 plumbing online and then you just go
59:28 passed the test and then you got
59:30 yourself a career boom put back to our
59:34 topic you know I've done an episode I
59:40 believe called thinking big and it's one
59:45 of these just basic facts of life and I
59:50 gave you another analogy which I'll use
59:52 right at this point to drive at home
59:57 let's say that you needed $10,000 to pay
60:03 for something pay off your debts to buy
60:06 something it's very important for you a
60:08 wedding ring or something if you don't
60:12 conceive in your brain that you need the
60:15 $10,000 then you have zero chance of
60:17 getting it
60:18 besides absolutely a random thing
60:20 happening in your life right that's
60:22 enough money in America in 2020 usually
60:25 random events don't happen unless you
60:27 literally buy a scratch-off ticket and
60:29 win for a lottery ticket and when the
60:32 lower in numbers right you don't get
60:34 that kind of money earth in there but if
60:36 you can conceive of it what I like to
60:38 say to people is if it was gonna be a
60:41 hundred percent difficult for you to
60:43 make the 10 grand that you need but you
60:44 can't conceive of but then you have a
60:46 hundred percent difficulty if not an
60:50 infinite level of difficulty but the
60:52 second you can concede that you need the
60:53 money you automatically have the
60:56 difficulty to get it because now you're
60:58 looking for money you're looking for
61:00 ways that you can provide services or
61:02 products that can generate the cash it
61:06 might be as simple as you have a rich
61:07 uncle and you to make the phone call and
61:10 pitch them on it and they're gonna cut
61:12 you a check for $10,000 there you go but
61:15 if you can't conceive of it you won't
61:17 make the phone call and you won't make
61:18 the 10 grand why mention that because if
61:22 we don't think big and start getting fed
61:26 up with these systems that control us
61:29 then nothing is going to happen we're
61:32 gonna be living in a hopeless world but
61:35 I don't think any of you are hopeless I
61:37 don't think you feel that anymore I
61:39 might hit you ever once my you might get
61:41 pinged out really like a hot you know
61:42 what is this gonna happen you know like
61:44 everybody who follows the queueing on
61:45 thing or they're waiting for something
61:48 to occur that's why you don't want to be
61:51 dependent on others if in the episode
61:57 that I just recorded last night which
61:59 I'm going to put these out
61:59 chronologically so I can refer to it now
62:01 if we were to give all Americans a
62:04 complete and utter matrix plug into the
62:07 back of your brain understanding of the
62:10 Federal Reserve System
62:11 at fiat currency and petrol dollars and
62:15 the the elite of the world that have
62:18 dominated us and the whole history of
62:20 the Rothschilds at least the basic stuff
62:22 that you need to know for 350 million
62:25 people or at least 200 million people
62:27 that are adults who vote it would be
62:31 done overnight right for 24 hours that
62:34 machine you push the blue button and
62:36 they get this thought for 24 hours that
62:39 gives them time to have conversations to
62:41 call people and go can you believe this
62:43 I didn't know this yeah me either why
62:46 the hell do I know this I don't know
62:47 maybe somebody has a box of the blue
62:48 button right okay
62:52 well the blue button box was a fantasy
62:55 box that gives everyone in case you
62:57 haven't seen the episode it's a box that
62:59 gives everyone a thought for 24 hours
63:01 it's a fictitious thing which you write
63:03 down a piece of paper what you want to
63:04 want to think he put it inside push the
63:06 blue button old world has this thought
63:07 for 24 hours but just 200 million people
63:11 just which is only 1% of the world
63:16 population if they were to understand
63:19 the Cabal the Ponzi scheme a fiat
63:23 currency it would be over for the other
63:26 99% the torment the tyranny the serfdom
63:30 would all be gone poverty would be a
63:34 thing of the past and in terms of some
63:40 of the social fabrics that people fear
63:43 we know that regions of the world are
63:45 very very different from our regions
63:47 right I like to watch at times marathon
63:52 videos of these people that travel the
63:55 world usually they're men because you
63:57 have to be a guy I think and to pull
63:59 this off and not get hurt I'm not aware
64:03 of a female doing this in an aggressive
64:05 manner but they're these guys that make
64:07 you know Chronicle videos they're
64:09 sponsored by travel agencies and they
64:11 travel on all the supposed scared scary
64:14 places and they really do exist men
64:20 we have to hire guards you know to go
64:23 with them military people with ak-47s at
64:26 times so we have seen I have seen
64:29 personally areas of the world that you
64:31 couldn't just walk in and say you get
64:35 all the first world amenities first day
64:37 because they're still violent they're
64:39 still feral they need to have education
64:43 well first food than education and let
64:46 them all calm down right Plus once you
64:51 get rid of the fake money and its power
64:53 then these warlords and these shilly
64:56 government officials no longer make all
65:00 this aid money remember one of the
65:03 biggest money laundering schemes in the
65:05 world is aid money so anytime you're in
65:08 your country and your country says oh
65:11 we're giving a billion dollars to Brazil
65:15 to help them with their whole problem
65:17 down there Venezuela or any country you
65:19 want to name the way that deal is
65:22 working in the background is that as I
65:25 had it described to me in most cases
65:28 some IMF World Bank type agency is
65:34 arranging the aid package so let's just
65:37 say it's 1 billion because that's pretty
65:39 easy to keep in your brain 800 million
65:42 is gonna go back to the agents that
65:46 created the AIDS package and their aid
65:47 package in the first place and they're
65:49 gonna fund a bunch of dirty dark
65:52 projects taking over other countries
65:56 trafficking drugs buying satellites so
65:59 they can spy on you I mean they're gonna
66:01 do all kinds of bad stuff with that 800
66:02 million
66:03 if they even allow them to have that the
66:07 200 million then goes into the country
66:09 and is then cannibalized by all the
66:12 corrupt leaders the people maybe they
66:15 see 10 million maybe this you know I
66:19 mean if they're sitting around the table
66:20 with these individuals they don't give a
66:22 crap about their society they do not
66:24 they spend at least amount of money they
66:26 can to keep the people off their back
66:29 but the amount of countries that I have
66:31 seen that have been left sort of
66:34 subjects of corporations that are
66:37 pollute their land pollute their air
66:40 keep them in abject poverty and the
66:44 people don't revolt it's amazing but you
66:47 know why because they don't guns
66:49 cuz they're socialistic man I think we
66:54 have to change our standard a little bit
66:59 to say and there will come a time when
67:01 this standard can relax but it would
67:04 probably be decades from today depending
67:06 how fast we can re-engineer the planet
67:08 this is a two-stage process I'll get
67:10 into after the statement we have to
67:13 think big constantly now constantly it's
67:17 one thing to say we're globalist society
67:19 now because we can all communicate with
67:21 each other which is what I mean by that
67:23 so okay so why don't you have global
67:26 thoughts how to make the whole place
67:29 better now let's say that you're
67:36 listening to me say this kind of stuff
67:38 and you're like dude it won't work and
67:39 then I say why and you're like because
67:42 presidents get reelected in free
67:44 countries politicians get reelected in
67:47 free countries and if that occurs they
67:51 will infiltrate once again turn it all
67:53 back on and then we're back to where we
67:55 were
67:56 they're creating the repeat of history
67:58 aha
68:00 you're not wrong you're absolutely right
68:02 which is why the second phase of any
68:05 reengineering process any draining the
68:08 swamp process is to then pass
68:11 constitutional law or what you know by
68:15 the way I wanted to ask you guys in your
68:17 respective country what your
68:20 Constitution is called and sort of maybe
68:24 some of the history of your Constitution
68:26 so you know what are the the chief
68:29 what's the rule document that gives you
68:31 an alien Abul rights and if you don't
68:33 have one that's a good first step to go
68:36 for and is thinking big phase right but
68:40 I wrote an article over 10 years ago
68:43 about replacing our money and I came up
68:48 with this idea to pass as okay so let me
68:52 just give you a crash course in one
68:55 sentence in the United States we
68:57 cannibalized magna carta out of a
68:59 thousand ad we created ten bill of
69:02 rights for our constitution ten rules
69:05 that we'd run this country by as time
69:08 progressed we added more amendments to
69:10 the Constitution which required a
69:12 two-thirds majority vote from our Senate
69:15 in our house signed by the president and
69:17 then we added more rules this is where
69:20 we started treating you know blacks
69:22 properly and unfortunately we got the
69:25 sixteenth amendment which was drafted by
69:26 Philander Knox for the bankers that were
69:30 on Jekyll Island hatching this new thing
69:32 so we have a couple things that need to
69:36 occur but what we did was we said one
69:41 through ten was the Bill of Rights 11 +
69:44 were the amendments so they're all
69:46 numbered so what I said in the article
69:49 was first and foremost we have to
69:51 abolish the sixteenth Amendment because
69:53 if you have a Treasury note you don't
69:54 need it anymore
69:55 gets rid of fiat currency gets rid of
69:57 the Internal Revenue Service and the
69:59 police state that helps them go and
70:01 steal all your stuff and then I came up
70:05 with the zero amendment the zero
70:09 amendment proceeds all other amendments
70:11 proceeds even free speech and this is to
70:15 go back to biblical times and the First
70:18 Amendment is very simple it forbids
70:21 compound interest and any outrageous
70:25 interest but it also says that banks
70:27 can't be private anymore because it is a
70:29 strategic resource but it forbids any
70:32 company on our soil within our country
70:36 boundaries of exercising any type of
70:38 compound interest so if you owe someone
70:41 money they can't continue to turn
70:44 interest on top of you that's thinking
70:48 big and that's what we need to do
70:54 remember that the I mean you know I hope
70:59 this history is true but it was said
71:02 that in the time of Christ that you know
71:07 we had the definition of blasphemy which
71:10 was supposed to be the ultimate sin
71:11 which was to deny the exist of God the
71:15 existence of God and I'm sure that there
71:18 was you know Jesus linked to that as
71:20 well given his proximity to God etc but
71:24 they said that there was one sin that
71:28 was higher than blasphemy and it was
71:31 called usury and usury is compound
71:34 interest isn't it interesting that our
71:39 our forefathers from 2,000 years ago had
71:45 seen the danger of compound interest and
71:47 made it the ultimate sin it is the
71:52 mechanism by which they steal all kinds
71:55 of money from us right now again some
72:00 people make the argument that compound
72:02 interest is a motivating factor to get
72:04 your debts down don't run up your credit
72:05 cards to maximum and all that kind of
72:07 stuff you know we have to have some sort
72:11 of incentivizing system but as I've said
72:14 in previous episodes you have a fee for
72:16 borrowing money you do it's a fixed rate
72:19 low rate fee once you cap your your
72:23 allotment of borrowing power we could
72:27 have something you know that is simply
72:29 because it's a state organization I mean
72:31 it's a you know federal organization and
72:33 that's the only place you can ever
72:34 borrow money from they just simply say
72:36 well unless you can pitch us a reason
72:39 why we should increase your limit
72:40 starting into business you got some new
72:43 contract you just sign and it's gonna
72:44 give you annuities so we can loan you a
72:46 little bit more to just see that it
72:48 through you can't borrow anymore very
72:52 sorry but once you do pay it off you can
72:56 borrow more immediately she had a thirty
72:58 thousand dollar limit you pay ten
73:00 thousand you get ten thousand you can
73:01 play with there you go
73:04 but there's a deeper element to this
73:06 whole thing which is obviously the
73:09 within a first world booming country we
73:12 develop individuals that are so out of
73:15 touch with reality that in order to get
73:19 their vote for the things that are very
73:21 serious in reality you can't get them to
73:24 pay attention yeah you know the
73:27 derogatory definition of these people
73:30 would be mouth breathers and deride
73:31 people they're not bad people they just
73:34 don't have any knowledge of the world
73:36 because the education for them is sadly
73:40 the standard that is today you know it's
73:42 the every Child Left Behind regiment of
73:45 Common Core the United States what's
73:50 really interesting about things like
73:51 Common Core is that they they really do
73:56 pitch you a solution that is on paper at
74:01 the high level definitions right is
74:04 there for the low level implementation
74:05 levels but the high level implementation
74:07 sounds fantastic it actually is the
74:10 United States of America should not have
74:12 a different school system in
74:13 Massachusetts as a dozen Kansas I
74:15 personally experienced a massive despair
74:18 disparity between the two Massachusetts
74:21 was off the chain complicated Kansas was
74:24 very meat potatoes you got the education
74:27 I had you know again I got to be a
74:30 professional coder at 18 so it wasn't
74:32 bad I don't know what the computer
74:35 science thing would have been in the
74:36 Massachusetts because computers weren't
74:38 really being taught yet in in high
74:39 schools or doing your eyes at the time
74:41 because you just didn't have the
74:43 computers to teach kids on I'm sure it's
74:46 very complicated but the amount of
74:47 friends I have that were born and raised
74:49 in Massachusetts who have PhDs is way
74:51 higher than other areas of the country
74:55 okay so we should be able to find for
74:58 each respective country a a common core
75:04 now I'm assuming that it's much easier
75:06 if your population is smaller you know
75:09 one of the things that Americans and I'm
75:11 guilty of it too that we forget
75:13 is that you know we're 350 million 365
75:18 or something like that here in America
75:19 right well countries in Europe or some
75:23 of them are 40 60 I mean
75:25 Tokyo has more people living in their
75:27 city of Tokyo and Japan that some
75:29 countries have for their entire
75:31 population well there's an advantage the
75:34 smaller that your country is think about
75:37 what I'm saying here I'm I am having to
75:39 in my math my by add my ad hoc math and
75:43 this episode I'm saying that we have to
75:46 have you know for a clean win 200
75:49 million of 365 was saying on the same
75:52 page with the Federal Reserve in order
75:54 to get rid of it impulsively just boom
75:57 it's gone but what if you're in a
75:59 country only has 60 million people
76:01 that's fantastic isn't it I think Europe
76:05 totaled is twice the amount of America
76:08 so there's quite a few people there and
76:10 because the EU and you're fighting a
76:12 whole thing you have a big problem you
76:14 have cultural differences between
76:15 countries and then you have to you don't
76:19 get all those different borderline folks
76:22 together I mean the Germans are gonna
76:23 have to convince the French and Spanish
76:24 in the Italians and you know any other
76:27 country that's got a lot of people guys
76:30 we can't be can't continue this this EU
76:32 thing is not working and we're pretty
76:35 sure they had a hand in the local or the
76:38 current problem we have in 2020 World
76:41 Health Organization is lying about
76:44 pandemic lying on every single level you
76:48 know trying to keep it concealed so it
76:50 spreads trying to throw every single
76:53 body type in it you know death type in
76:55 it to make sure the numbers go
76:56 exaggerated up these agencies are not
76:59 the slice but interested in our
77:02 prosperity
77:03 quite the opposite which is why they
77:05 have their program agenda 21 it's not
77:09 there to help you it's there to - you
77:12 have about a 97 to 99 percent chance of
77:15 being killed by them in some way shape
77:17 or form some 99% of Irish or whatever
77:21 but they want you in poverty
77:24 look what they just did look what they
77:27 just did they halted the entire world
77:29 economy the IMF came out today on the
77:32 14th let's just say I've April 2020 and
77:36 said that the whole world is going to
77:38 experience a 3.5% negative growth until
77:43 2021 and then they then they said of
77:47 course they have nothing to do with any
77:49 of us to be honest you know our
77:51 willpower to create and make money it's
77:53 not up to them it's up to us you know
77:56 you could create a youtube channel
77:57 tomorrow and put some really wild
77:59 content on it and you're reaping the
78:01 dough then he starts selling a product
78:03 start selling t-shirts and books and
78:04 speaking circuits and whatever you could
78:07 defend a product for a car and make you
78:09 know whatever gobs and gobs of money
78:11 they don't control us so we shouldn't
78:15 let their words mean anything to us but
78:18 they just try it they just they're going
78:20 to be trying to create a sucking sound
78:24 to stop us from getting powerful through
78:28 money I mean these people that make
78:32 these documentaries they're just thrown
78:34 on YouTube or I don't even know where
78:37 they air outside of YouTube they're
78:40 really educate us on what's going on in
78:44 the world so we can have at least a
78:45 first-hand perspective of what
78:47 individuals are experiencing and the
78:48 suffering that they're going through if
78:50 they have no money then they can't run
78:52 around and inform us okay well they're
78:57 they're pushing to get it and we gotta
78:59 fight back like I've been saying I think
79:03 what we are lacking in this sort of
79:08 transformational phase that I'm
79:11 describing is we really are yet to have
79:15 a a package that's as clean as their
79:19 fraud called climate change right
79:22 they've got a clean package for that
79:25 fraud and they've put billions into
79:27 paying off you know Chile scientists to
79:32 get their you know their grants you know
79:34 their money and so these people will say
79:37 anything
79:37 and then they do indoctrinate people
79:39 that just again or they're more in that
79:41 category of climatology their mouth
79:43 breathers and so they're like okay oh
79:45 man he's gonna all Mel okay well I'll
79:48 put it in my script I'll put it in my
79:49 television show
79:50 talk to my friends I'll chastise my
79:52 friends if they don't believe you
79:55 I said a long long time ago hundreds of
80:00 episodes ago that I was in a car once
80:03 and it was my girlfriend's mom was in
80:07 the backseat and I forgot what she was
80:11 talking about and I wasn't awake this
80:12 was in the 90s and I heard this sort of
80:18 trying to play a trump card over the
80:21 conversation not to do with Donald Trump
80:23 but the old you know card game trump
80:25 card theory and it was something about
80:29 NASA saying something and again I was
80:33 not awake towards anything I've ever
80:35 talked about in us at the time but
80:37 whatever she was saying sounded like
80:38 [ __ ]
80:39 and I remember listening and curse was
80:43 my girlfriend's mom so you got to be
80:45 kind of careful with that situation I
80:46 remember listening and I don't think I
80:49 replied or said anything in response but
80:52 it was I was questioning you know
80:54 further what she was saying and then her
80:58 trump card that she threw down was well
81:00 it came from a guy at NASA so you know
81:02 it's got to be true something did
81:04 something to that effect and I remember
81:07 without having any super negative
81:09 feelings towards NASA at the time
81:11 feeling like that was a [ __ ] way to
81:13 into conversation it was a way to throw
81:15 down well you're not allowed to question
81:17 anything that's going on in this
81:19 conversation because I said that NASA
81:22 said it you know it was like we do that
81:27 too much again we're just watching a
81:32 video or several videos today at the
81:35 lounge about this backlash that Bill
81:38 Gates is happing right he has a Twitter
81:40 feed full of thousands of thousands of
81:44 comments calling for his immediate death
81:46 I mean execution
81:49 and they were talking about cutting that
81:51 off hanging him from the gallows
81:53 electric chairs everything it's it's all
81:56 over the web I'm sure you guys have seen
81:58 it if you're paying attention
82:00 20 years ago I bought a book called
82:03 guerilla marketing I think that's the
82:05 name of the book it's a black book black
82:08 cover or whatever and I got through it
82:12 and it was essentially telling you the
82:17 reader that in order to build a company
82:20 into a powerful franchise if you can you
82:25 should build up an icon within the
82:28 company and it was calling out I believe
82:31 Steve Jobs as an example you know Steve
82:35 Jobs earned his reputation right and so
82:39 did Steve Wozniak up to a point but
82:41 Steve left Wozniak left really early but
82:45 Steve Jobs you know he was just revered
82:47 for being a Rijal thinker and really
82:50 massaging other people's ideas and to
82:51 Kummer for products a lot of people have
82:53 great ideas but they can't quite polish
82:54 it to be perfect you know and but think
82:58 about it you know Henry Ford Sam Walton
83:00 with a guy from Wendy's you know they
83:02 were all in there saying look these
83:04 people built up personality such that
83:06 you fall in love with the person that
83:07 runs the company Martha Stewart Oprah
83:09 Winfrey and it's they get to a point
83:13 where they can't do anything wrong and I
83:16 even watched you know the Super Bowl
83:18 this year had that believe it was JLo
83:21 and akhira was that her name and you
83:25 know Keira walks up and does the goat
83:28 tongue thang total devil worshipping
83:31 move well that she knows that's what
83:32 she's doing or not it bakes in no sense
83:34 for this beautiful girl to stick out her
83:36 tongue and flap it like a goat does I
83:38 mean it's like exactly it's just eerie
83:40 and weird JLo I she's just an
83:43 entertainer
83:44 but I'm not sure she's in any cabal or
83:46 anything but
83:48 past performances have been littered
83:51 with just all kinds of symbology and
83:54 crazy stuff right and so when the
83:59 critique comes out about the celebrities
84:02 engaging in these activities I've heard
84:05 it in my own circles people I'm dating
84:07 will say oh come on you know give me a
84:09 break she's just singing music in a
84:11 million you think so you really think so
84:13 you know what is it Miley Cyrus and her
84:17 whole tongue thing again full-on devil
84:22 worshiper man I mean it's ridiculous I
84:24 mean I don't believe in the devil I
84:25 don't believe it is saying I believe in
84:27 evil people and evil deeds but if
84:30 someone thinks that they're aligning
84:31 with darkness
84:32 it's what could their objectives be you
84:36 know so that is one paradigm that we can
84:40 start breaking down that just because
84:42 you get popular neil degrasse tyson bill
84:45 nye the douchebag guy it was a 100%
84:48 actor zero percent scientist straight
84:50 I'm sure he's learned a lot over the
84:52 course of his life he could probably
84:54 school any one of us on something that
84:56 he's presented that we haven't studied
84:57 but they get to the point where these
85:00 people are was sort of indefensible like
85:04 they can't be critiqued in any way shape
85:08 or form
85:09 Bill Gates got himself from his
85:14 sociopathic past of being the absolute
85:17 bonafide Revenge of the Nerds did which
85:20 is nothing wrong with that he steals him
85:23 das for IBM calls it ms-dos and everyone
85:26 thinks he invented it he stills the GUI
85:28 from Steve Jobs who paid Xerox 110
85:32 million dollars in stock for that
85:33 privilege to use the GUI he doesn't have
85:35 to pay anything he rips it off they
85:38 smuggle project Ashkelon out of the 80s
85:40 into the Windows platform to be the
85:43 greatest spying operating system on
85:45 planet Earth and so then he you know
85:49 moves up to the point he leaves the
85:50 company and then he's a Multi multi
85:54 billionaire
85:57 and amount of comments that I've heard
85:59 from people and there's a great
86:02 phenomenon going on which leads into
86:04 this on my social networking stuff but
86:09 the people defending him as a good man
86:11 and he's such a great guy and all this
86:13 other stuff they know nothing about his
86:14 TED talk you know if claiming he's gonna
86:16 reduce the world population ten to
86:18 fifteen percent using vaccinations I
86:19 mean how does that work right but now he
86:23 got all the way up to the peak of really
86:24 reengineering his personality with
86:26 everyone to be this Gandhi of
86:29 contribution and philanthropy and in one
86:32 month he just moved from hero to zero
86:36 because he will continue to be hated for
86:40 the rest of his life the group of people
86:42 that dislike this man is only gonna get
86:43 bigger
86:44 between now and his death it's over for
86:47 that dude it is over mark my words men
86:49 so here's something that's going on that
86:52 I think is really cool in terms of the
86:53 wake up theme by the way Barack Obama
86:57 came out and said that Joe Biden's gonna
86:59 assure in a Great Awakening hahaha yeah
87:03 you're gonna learn all about dementia
87:06 during this presidential campaign anyway
87:10 I can definitely say to the guys which
87:13 is 95 percent of my audience for you
87:15 ladies this is actually you're probably
87:17 one of these people in some way shape or
87:20 form but a woman on you know Facebook
87:23 who posts you know a series of
87:25 attractive photos I grab photographs of
87:27 herself yeah some of them are just
87:29 beautiful profile some of them are
87:30 full-body cuz they're there at that age
87:33 as they can do that they always get a
87:36 bunch of renegade dudes and you know
87:39 every once in a while you'll see them
87:40 post comments like hey don't message me
87:43 you know just because I let you into my
87:46 friend group cuz you know I'm not
87:48 interested I'm married I know I don't
87:51 harvest my boyfriends or husbands from
87:53 social media but they eat a lot of like
87:57 stragglers right they don't have
87:59 anything to do with their life
87:59 personally
88:02 and what's been fascinating in this last
88:04 month and a half is that I have several
88:08 very attractive friends and the in both
88:11 sides of the camp but definitely the
88:13 female side of things just just happens
88:15 right and they have been posting lucid
88:20 posts about the fraud of this whole
88:22 thing even folks that I would never
88:24 imagine who are nurses okay who are you
88:28 know god-fearing Christian women would
88:31 never swear in a conversation you know
88:33 you would think that they were more
88:36 willing to go with the the trends of
88:40 what people are saying or posting
88:43 anywhere from this is a complete fraud
88:46 Bill Gates should get AIDS and die or
88:48 something like that I've seen you know
88:50 they should get Coppa hope he gets Govan
88:51 and he dies I mean I've seen posts like
88:53 that from these women and then all these
88:55 guys are like completely shocked you
88:57 know the ones that are completely asleep
88:59 which isn't a lot but there's enough
89:00 that these women are leveraging their
89:04 attraction instead of having to fend off
89:09 guys trying to send them inappropriate
89:12 pictures or whatever they are now body
89:15 slamming the consciousness of all their
89:18 followers with lucidity and it's amazing
89:20 but one of my friends is an absolute
89:23 sweetheart and again the last person on
89:26 planet earth I would have ever imagined
89:27 to take any any tiny baby step towards
89:31 this being a conspiracy she just posted
89:35 one of the most gentle beautiful highly
89:37 accessible posts about the fact that she
89:41 is not seeing anything related to the
89:43 panic that's going on and she's a
89:45 registered nurse super cool I tell you
89:50 that because you know one of the things
89:55 that I think that maybe we don't do
89:59 enough is to itemize how much we're
90:03 winning at any point in time with this
90:05 whole thing
90:06 and you know it's it's easy when you
90:09 don't take inventory of how much you're
90:13 winning to think that you're losing or
90:16 that it's a hopeless situation or man
90:19 it's just too much stuff that needs to
90:20 change and you know if you were 20 years
90:23 old and you're gonna live to be 80 60
90:24 years might be enough but if you're 50
90:27 60 70 you thinking geez even if I do
90:30 everything right between now in the time
90:32 I die to change the world to a better
90:36 place
90:36 I may or may not see it doesn't matter
90:40 doesn't matter I just was watching this
90:45 funny special on him musicians that have
90:49 lost limbs or had some it was they put
90:53 Paul Stanley in there he has a deformed
90:55 right ear that he always covered up with
90:58 his hair I had a childhood friend had
91:00 the same thing but they they talked
91:03 about Jim Croce and I think I have his
91:07 history correct in that here he is
91:09 making you know Leroy Brown and all
91:13 these crazy amazing songs out of the 70s
91:15 that even though he died in a plane
91:18 accident but he became popular after he
91:23 died and there's a few people like that
91:26 where they never really saw any money
91:28 while they were alive like van Gogh is
91:30 one of them but they made all of their
91:33 they got all their notoriety and fame
91:35 after the fact even the Mona Lisa wasn't
91:37 famous until someone stole the thing at
91:40 one point and it became the most popular
91:42 thing ever so you know some of us are
91:47 gonna have to contribute at that level
91:48 we don't know when our tickets gonna get
91:50 punched so it's like one of those things
91:54 if I told you you know if God came down
91:58 and told you not me but God comes down
92:00 and tells you know in the next year
92:03 you're gonna be up here with me don't
92:06 worry you won't suffer but you're gonna
92:09 be up with me this is a really awesome
92:10 place by the way but why don't you take
92:13 your last year of life and make it
92:14 really worthwhile and then how would you
92:19 live your life different
92:20 you know Steve Jobs said at his
92:22 graduation speech at Stanford he said
92:25 you know I live every day like it's my
92:27 last because at that point in time he
92:30 had recovered from his pancreatic cancer
92:34 mysteriously he wanted to sue Google and
92:36 he got it again
92:37 hmm so keep that in mind as you think
92:41 about how much you're participating in
92:43 this game
92:44 you know and again if you get
92:45 overwhelmed like I've said in other
92:47 episodes you don't have to be on the
92:49 front lines every day you got too much
92:51 going on you just pull back someone else
92:53 to take your spot people waking up every
92:55 single day and by the way when you do
92:59 pull back this is something that happens
93:02 to me in all things that I do but
93:05 definitely in screenwriting you know you
93:07 when you write a script you know it
93:09 takes typically a really good script
93:11 will take usually six months to two
93:15 years to design before you ever hit the
93:18 screenwriting software you're writing
93:20 all right but you're not writing in
93:21 screenwriting software you're designing
93:22 the turns and the twist and all that
93:24 kind of stuff and when you write outside
93:29 of a contract to get something done I've
93:33 done both on numerous occasions you you
93:39 worry about taking a break once you get
93:42 to the screenwriting phase even if you
93:45 got other scripts you're worried that
93:47 you won't finish it that you lose your
93:48 mojo for that particular script that's
93:51 happened to me as well because I've had
93:53 I got a comedy I'm working on trying to
93:55 finish and I wrote it Jesus ten years
93:58 ago at least probably twelve years ago
94:01 now and I was really in the pocket of
94:04 the comedy and I pulled out now I reread
94:06 it and I'm laughing my head off and I'm
94:08 like I gotta get my brain back into this
94:10 flow of how this comedy is supposed to
94:12 sound you know but I now intentionally
94:17 have been written several scripts I now
94:20 intentionally take two weeks off from
94:22 any script even if I don't have another
94:24 idea that it's gonna be hot and
94:25 something I'm working I take two weeks
94:27 off and it's a miracle and this is what
94:32 can happen to you if you take work take
94:35 time off from the front lines and I
94:37 don't know how many of you consider
94:38 yourself on the front lines some of you
94:40 are at that level you will have a chance
94:43 to rethink everything that you know to
94:46 be true and you will do what I call
94:50 distill you'll distill down your entire
94:54 pitch for a particular topic and this
94:58 happens naturally anyway you know for
95:01 those of you have ever had to explain
95:02 fiat currency NASA the shape of the
95:06 earth or whatever you have at the
95:09 beginning of the journey you have like
95:11 hours and hours and hours of
95:12 conversation to communicate the idea
95:16 then you a year goes by and you've had
95:21 the conversation so many times it's a
95:23 it's a couple pages of conversation then
95:26 it's a couple paragraphs then it's a few
95:28 sentences and what's interesting is as
95:31 you reduce the amount of words that you
95:34 speak it becomes more potent and more
95:37 powerful it's like a rich candy it just
95:40 hits you like a ton of bricks it's a
95:42 beautiful thing so I'd be interested in
95:47 your thoughts you know
95:48 to summarize let's put this way what I'm
95:51 saying to you is if one first rule
95:54 country can get rid of all this
95:56 corruption and America is in a good
96:00 position to pull this off your country
96:01 might as well my in addition be at that
96:04 point do let me know about that but I
96:07 think that one's one big giant first
96:09 world country starts to kick ass and
96:11 take names with a big population
96:14 especially then the rest will follow
96:17 because look at jealous of the power and
96:20 quite economically may have to follow to
96:23 stay economically viable in the world
96:26 I think that will trickle down to the
96:29 rest of the world and will potentially
96:35 fix this place but let me know if you
96:37 agree with that hypothesis if you don't
96:41 or you have additional modifications to
96:43 it or other priorities
96:44 definitely lay it down in the comments
96:46 because I want to hear your thought
96:48 process because I am distilling at this
96:51 point the entire pitch of how we can in
96:54 this ridiculous cycle I think that for
96:59 anything that we couch anything that's
97:02 horrible that we get rid of we have to
97:04 pass laws at the constitutional level
97:08 that makes it stick out like a sore
97:10 thumb if anyone tries to bring it back
97:13 one of the things that I wrote in my
97:16 document about replacing the money with
97:18 sovereign money was that we need to at
97:22 least deflate the amount of money that
97:25 it takes to buy anything by how do I say
97:30 this
97:30 10x so for instance if you made a
97:33 hundred thousand dollars a year you now
97:35 make ten thousand dollars a year because
97:36 everything you need to buy fits in that
97:38 ten thousand dollar envelope just
97:40 exactly like you did for a hundred
97:42 thousand dollars why is that because you
97:48 know one of the crude analogies is
97:50 dropping a penny should mean something
97:51 to you because that can buy something a
97:53 penny can actually buy something a
97:56 quarter can buy something a dollar can
97:57 buy something make every unit you have
97:59 in your possession very valuable but
98:02 there's a lot of money laundering
98:03 schemes out there there's a lot of
98:06 siphoning embezzlement schemes out there
98:07 that rely on the fact that money is
98:09 inflated for instance let's say a
98:14 burrito restaurant makes three million
98:17 dollars a year okay they get a corrupt
98:21 cash register person accountant whatever
98:24 someone has access to the money and
98:26 they're stealing out of that cash
98:28 register
98:30 a little bit of money all the time and
98:33 it doesn't show up on the books because
98:34 the numbers are so massive that when
98:37 they still add extra buck out of the
98:38 thing you don't notice it but now what
98:41 if you could buy a burrito for a dime
98:45 instead of a buck losing a dime would
98:51 need something now
98:52 and so corruption I think by design
98:55 would be at least inhibited a little bit
98:57 by deflating the money the amount of
99:01 currency required to buy the same exact
99:03 items so little things like that could
99:07 police and marshal things we have to put
99:10 in regulations against corruption and
99:12 not regulations against living anyway
99:16 let me know what you think if you happen
99:19 to deep thoughts radio.com please go
99:21 there's - video - audio for social media
99:23 it's a great locked Facebook group
99:25 please get up there a couple ways to
99:27 donate but again we're in a bad
99:28 situation at this point so don't worry
99:30 about it there's a store if you want to
99:31 chat ski or two there is a all-new
99:34 remastered season one in its own channel
99:37 until next time take care of yourself
99:39 and someone else and I will see you in
99:41 the next deep thoughts over now
