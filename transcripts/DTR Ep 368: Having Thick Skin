00:00 [Music]
00:33 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:35 gentlemen today we're going to talk
00:37 about getting a thick skin I beated
00:42 calling this you know becoming a man but
00:47 I think that there's a lot of generic
00:48 qualities to this it doesn't have to be
00:50 chauvinistic Li one way or the other and
00:54 the reason why I was inclined to use the
00:55 the male title is that this really calls
00:59 out to when I was taught what I'm gonna
01:01 say in this video here now for those of
01:06 you who feel like you've got this all
01:08 under control you probably do and so I
01:12 would ask you guys to kindly watch the
01:14 video so that if I miss something that's
01:17 really obvious that helped you in your
01:18 life please share it down below and then
01:21 we can kind of create this again on like
01:24 college of information that comes from
01:26 all sides right I'm just sort of the the
01:29 maestro kicking off everyone's synapse
01:32 and then smarter people than I am should
01:37 come in and correct and adjust and share
01:40 your opinions too
01:41 one of the interesting things about
01:43 growing up is who you're surrounded by
01:46 when you grow up it's it's a heavy it
01:50 has a heavy effect on who you are as a
01:52 human being if you were a male and you
01:55 are not surrounded by males it is almost
01:58 impossible to become one and if you do
02:01 then and I mean psychologically you know
02:07 then there's the urine of extremely
02:09 observant human being and there's
02:11 probably nothing you couldn't be if you
02:14 wanted to which is a great thing to know
02:16 about yourself as well obviously if
02:19 you're a girl and you're raised strictly
02:21 by males there's gonna be a level of
02:23 femininity that's just not going to
02:25 happen unless you're observant and you
02:27 draw from people outside your camp but
02:31 what happens when you're a kid when
02:32 you're a kid you're in your parents care
02:36 until geez quite a ways you know at
02:39 least five years old
02:41 some of you might have had preschool or
02:43 something like that
02:44 daycare so get a little bit a little bit
02:48 of exposure outside of your your window
02:51 but if you don't have like a really good
02:53 support group that matches your gender
02:55 that matches your Jennifer
02:56 identification I should say then you
03:01 could be missing a lot of basic
03:02 information and then you'll bump into
03:05 folks that have had that camaraderie
03:06 your friend with like 20 brothers and
03:09 ten uncles and you're fought their
03:11 father's like you know some [ __ ] bear
03:13 hunter or whatever and you'll start
03:16 noticing a major difference if you
03:17 didn't if you weren't raised exactly the
03:19 same way now beating around the bush in
03:23 a rather symbolic way for a reason
03:25 because I learned this stuff again as a
03:29 male who identified as a straight male I
03:32 don't know what it's like to identify as
03:35 a woman you know of a female straight
03:38 female I'm not gonna have any
03:42 information for any of you LGBT folks
03:44 you know you're the experts in your
03:45 region so I apologize it's going to be a
03:47 big H episode I think there's valuable
03:51 lessons on both sides just pick whatever
03:53 gender we're talking about if you
03:54 identify with that maybe there's some
03:56 stuff in here for you I don't exactly
03:59 remember the moment in time when this
04:05 content came to me but I remember the
04:08 words that were said and I remember the
04:10 general tense of the scene sometimes it
04:14 would be in my own family where you know
04:16 my dad would just say toughen up man and
04:19 then I would be out and with other
04:22 friends of mine with their family
04:23 members their uncles any answer we're
04:25 really uncles and brothers and fathers
04:29 and it was just going on around me that
04:32 we do this men do this and there's no
04:37 crying in baseball sort of thing part of
04:40 it is as a child I felt like I and I
04:44 feel like we as children we just want to
04:47 learn what we're supposed to do
04:48 sometimes because there's this
04:51 insecurity all the time that we're
04:52 failing
04:54 something until we figure out what we're
04:56 supposed to do obviously we're wrong
04:58 we're not feeling that often if ever we
05:02 simply just don't know what the rest of
05:04 the tribe is doing and so we're out
05:06 there with ears just perked up but this
05:11 episode is gonna be about getting a
05:12 thick skin and it's a it's sort of an
05:16 interesting concept because we know that
05:18 life for any of you are who have lived
05:21 either a tumultuous young life and
05:24 you're still young or those of you you
05:26 know thirty and above and you've had
05:28 your balls kicked in a couple times you
05:32 know life doesn't really exist as an
05:34 entity that has a consciousness it
05:36 simply is the collection of events that
05:38 you call your existence on this planet
05:43 but we tend to anthropomorphize life and
05:46 we tend to give it some sort of teddy
05:48 bear identity inside of our mind
05:51 sometimes to deal with it you hear it
05:53 said all the time well life doesn't life
05:55 just does this well you know you're due
05:56 for this you're due for that and it's
05:58 like what you're acting like the outer
06:01 chaos that is around me has a
06:02 consciousness outside of God that is
06:05 that is you know saying I deserve a
06:09 [ __ ] traffic ticket because I haven't
06:11 had one in 30 years I deserve an
06:13 accident because I haven't had one and
06:15 you know it's like that's ridiculous it
06:18 makes it feel like there's some stupid
06:20 rationale layer on top of life and there
06:22 is none but what is our our whole base
06:26 archetype in the 21st century for a
06:29 living
06:29 well you're born then you get educated
06:33 then you get a job for some corporation
06:37 if you work really hard you can stay in
06:40 the corporation for a long time build up
06:41 your 401k get a retirement package and
06:44 it you know I know 75 by the time anyone
06:47 is alive today retires you get your full
06:49 Social Security but we know that those
06:54 corporations never hang on to you for
06:56 any length of time and I you know you
07:00 just need to understand a corporation
07:01 doesn't care where you live or die and
07:04 if you think your corporation does then
07:07 you've bought
07:07 a line of [ __ ] you know let's just
07:11 say that Steve Jobs didn't die and he's
07:14 like Apple cares about you and you look
07:17 at that guy and you're like man you are
07:19 a genuine dude
07:20 well eventually he is gonna die and he's
07:23 gonna die before you before you have to
07:25 stop working before you can stop working
07:28 some other Tim Cook's gonna get in there
07:30 and he doesn't carry the same values
07:32 this is nothing against him specifically
07:34 but someone might just come in he's very
07:36 raw corporatism you're gone you're old
07:40 the hell we're not making old Geritol
07:43 products making young hip products for
07:46 whatever weird generation is coming up
07:48 these days
07:51 thick skin is very handy in these
07:54 crossroads of life it used to be the
07:57 couples will get married right out of
07:59 high school 18 to 20 years old everybody
08:03 was married you know and you were a
08:06 [ __ ] anomaly if you got 225 and you
08:09 weren't married there's all kinds of
08:11 books and films made you know over
08:15 between Alexa probably 50 to 100 years
08:17 back where the plot is nothing more than
08:21 a girl who wants to fall in love with
08:23 someone and she's holding out and she's
08:25 being called it old maid by her mother
08:27 her sister she's an anomaly in the town
08:31 but today society acts against that
08:34 instinct and so people wait forever to
08:39 get married it's probably related to
08:41 some depopulation you know mindset you
08:45 know the older you get the less kids you
08:47 have all the people that got married in
08:49 my high school that were married by 20
08:53 by god they had three to five kids every
08:56 single one of them and good for them
08:59 good people having good kids not too bad
09:03 but as we move around in society we had
09:08 these situations don't we were your
09:11 perhaps
09:13 fairly thick-skinned and so you bump
09:16 into someone who isn't thick-skinned and
09:18 you're just doing your normal thing that
09:20 you've done there you don't have any
09:21 problems having friends getting respect
09:23 from your associates you get the job
09:25 done you make tons of money for the
09:26 corporation you work for your own
09:27 company that you've created and then
09:30 you'll just sort of say something in
09:31 public or say something in private with
09:33 someone to friend maybe a new
09:35 relationship by God they just they look
09:39 at you like you just slaughtered some
09:42 ethic in their mind because there
09:46 there's a group of people their family
09:49 their circle of friends for some reason
09:52 they're all like and they're not like
09:54 your circle of friends now there are
09:58 drama queens and and on both sides of
10:00 the sexes I won't put a tremendous
10:03 amount of focus in those folks because
10:05 what can you do for them why waste our
10:07 time talking about them this is a
10:10 self-improvement episode designed to
10:14 give you a little bit of traction on
10:19 perhaps whether or not you're too stoic
10:23 or you're too soft I think it's good to
10:27 be capable of turning on both to
10:30 whatever extent you need if I'm writing
10:34 a script I really want to turn on my
10:37 sort of empathetic feminine mind no no
10:43 dude wants to say that but it's true I
10:44 have to write females from time to time
10:46 that are sobbing and crying or I want to
10:50 make sure that whatever is happening in
10:52 the script whether it's males or females
10:53 interacting with each other or some
10:54 alien or something I want a female to
10:57 cry in the audience and if I don't
10:59 identify with her brain then I can't get
11:02 the script finished now what's
11:06 interesting for me when I grew up you
11:08 know I grew up in a little tiny hometown
11:10 eventually and then I had to leave
11:14 because my parents lastly bounced
11:15 through a few towns again I went to New
11:17 England for a couple years almost three
11:19 years and then came back and I found out
11:23 something extremely interesting when I
11:25 came back to my home
11:26 I realized that I through going through
11:29 all these different schools and going
11:31 through all these different you know
11:33 darker errors of my life where I was you
11:37 know again I may have it may have
11:39 happens in my hometown as well but it
11:40 didn't seem like these kids had those
11:41 backgrounds were you know again there
11:45 was a lot of brawling in my head from
11:49 like I don't know fifth grade all the
11:50 way to eighth grade there was just just
11:52 I don't what the hell the deal was all
11:55 the kids were sort of busting out of
11:56 their thing and it all became a physical
11:58 violence thing and then when I landed in
12:00 back in my hometown then there was the
12:02 whole hey you're the new kid I'm a geek
12:04 and so I'm gonna try to you know rough
12:07 you up sort of thing and then we had
12:08 this one kid that was you know mentally
12:10 ill who was [ __ ] monster who was all
12:13 over everybody and he just happened to
12:14 think I was great so what ended up
12:19 happening was I came back and I noticed
12:20 that there was a level of faux
12:27 resilience and then there was a level of
12:31 real I've seen [ __ ] and I'm not afraid
12:35 of you sort of thing and what's nice is
12:38 when you see the kids kind of pretending
12:40 to be tough you'll you'll have these
12:42 kids that when they're young they start
12:44 to lower their voice you know I think
12:46 Alex Jones his voice is a fake voice and
12:48 I think it is his real voice today but I
12:51 think the whole thing of that gravelly
12:53 voice is some weird insecurity that
12:55 happened a long time ago
12:56 you're trying to sound tough you're
12:58 trying to sound like a cowboy or
12:59 whatever it is and it just becomes your
13:02 voice and I could be wrong but it just
13:03 doesn't sound genuine to me and I think
13:04 he slips all the time into a normal
13:07 voice Michael Jackson had the exact
13:10 opposite thing he had this fake little
13:12 voice but he really had a normal man
13:14 voice when he would talk it's just his
13:16 choice all right
13:18 to each their own not hurt anybody
13:20 whatever choice they're making a what
13:22 they want to sound like but at a very
13:25 young age I saw these kids and there was
13:29 something very interesting about it
13:30 because there was a level of empathy
13:32 still existent in their body that I
13:34 think maybe I had pounded out at the
13:36 time
13:36 and we had a few like in in the Midwest
13:40 you have accidents that occur and
13:43 they're a big deal
13:44 when someone wrecks a car and either
13:46 perishes in the accident or gets
13:49 severely injured the response of the
13:52 town is one of the most phenomenal
13:53 things we'll ever see in your life
13:55 everyone will contribute to the repair
13:59 of that family everywhere you go they
14:02 treat you carefully until you're healed
14:05 it's an amazing thing in the big city
14:08 there's none of that you know if you
14:10 could lose your whole family in an
14:12 accident on Monday and you'll go into a
14:13 restaurant Tuesday and no one knows and
14:16 maybe that has more health to it I don't
14:17 know but now I have a thick skin at all
14:23 well it controls how much you respond to
14:27 certain events now sometimes that could
14:32 be you know what I think you need to
14:34 have is this constant consciousness of
14:38 when you don't need to turn it on and
14:42 you'll see this a lot in big cities
14:44 where you have guys that are it I'm just
14:48 gonna this is a compliment so ever
14:51 wouldn't relax here my Latino friends
14:53 here it's amazing
14:56 the ones that have been here forever you
14:58 know they can look and there's that
15:01 actor I forget who's name is he's the
15:03 guy with the really incredible face
15:06 that's he's really grimacing he always
15:08 plays like a gangbanger in movies but
15:11 he's anything but that but my Latino
15:14 buddies they can put on a face that will
15:16 just terrify you but in the end when you
15:20 get inside their bubble and they realize
15:23 who you are like I could pull up to
15:24 their house and if for whatever reason a
15:27 split second they don't recognize me
15:29 they will give me that face but the
15:32 second they see me and they recognize me
15:34 the smile that comes across their face
15:35 is the most inviting face you've ever
15:39 seen in your life and you're immediately
15:41 part of their family and that's the
15:45 talent I think we all need we need to
15:46 have that I mean we don't necessarily
15:48 want to be putting out a bad vibe or a
15:50 vibe that could be misconstrued as
15:51 aggressive
15:53 that's not what it's about this little
15:56 tiny birds back there and he's just
15:57 going nuts so do I like about recording
16:01 outside you guys get a little bit of
16:02 nature sounds now the other issue is
16:06 that being capable of going through
16:09 stressful things and maintaining
16:12 composure for you personally it's a good
16:14 thing you you're able to stay productive
16:16 which is nice
16:18 it may not be comfortable it may be
16:21 totally comfortable it's just the nature
16:23 of the game you might get excited as it
16:25 gets more difficult because you've been
16:27 here before
16:28 again a creative projects always do that
16:30 to you if you are searching for a
16:33 partner sometimes your partner is
16:36 looking for your strengths one of the
16:39 funny things I always think about is
16:41 would my partner be able to survive the
16:43 apocalypse you know with me that's
16:49 important to me I don't need some
16:51 fragile goddamn snowflake balling every
16:55 15 minutes with me
16:57 I need a chick who's like I'm hungry we
17:01 need to go run for food yeah you know at
17:03 how much ammunition do we got left is
17:06 the world a nicer more pleasant place
17:10 today than it was 30 40 years ago the
17:15 question is no now do we want it to be
17:19 like that again answers yes is our
17:23 generation going to be able to
17:25 experience it mmm not sure not sure one
17:31 I mean there's there several factors to
17:34 it one will society ever be like it was
17:36 just say in the 70s and 80s in America
17:39 can't speak for any other country I
17:41 don't know but that 15 years between
17:44 1975 and 1990 was just euphoric in this
17:47 country okay so that needs to happen
17:52 that little miracle and just think about
17:54 it just prior to that miracle occurring
17:56 we had Vietnam at the Vietnam War for
17:59 almost you know at 11:12 years we had
18:03 the Korean War we had World War two
18:05 the depression what were one I mean we
18:07 had a lot of horrible decades prior to
18:10 that 15 years of like mind-blowing
18:13 creativity and enjoyment I'm assuming at
18:18 least Britain was the same way because
18:19 Britain provided plenty of our music
18:21 over here that we enjoyed but then they
18:24 did that in the 60s and 70s or early 70s
18:26 as well what was interesting when I grew
18:29 up as a kid was that the the
18:31 grandparents and the parents that were
18:32 slightly older were far more stoic it
18:37 was as if they couldn't laugh some of
18:39 them which is so depressing you know
18:41 you're like gosh I hope well there's a
18:43 movie that makes you laugh Johnny Carson
18:45 could tell a joke and get you to chuckle
18:47 a little bit because the world with that
18:49 laughter oh my god that's that's a bad
18:51 place right now I made an episode way
18:55 back in season 1 called being intense
18:57 and now I can tell you why I made it I
19:01 made it because I was dating someone
19:04 that was struggling with my intensity
19:08 now again at the time I was doing in
19:11 kilcher radio and I hadn't really
19:13 loosened up a little bit I was just
19:15 starting this show which really helped
19:17 me loosen up plus we didn't have the
19:22 letter 17 running around out there
19:24 trying to help us out we didn't have the
19:26 president that we have now so there was
19:27 really no hope so perhaps I was a little
19:30 more intense but the other time other
19:32 thing was there was a lot of drinking
19:36 involved on the other side and I was
19:39 just like goddammit I want to get rid of
19:40 this [ __ ] out of my life I am no
19:43 longer into lying to people to make them
19:46 feel better about themselves when it
19:48 comes to addiction I don't have to be
19:51 rude and I don't have to be mean but I
19:54 don't have to tell them that I agree
19:56 with it or I'm going to make this a part
19:58 of my life to be with them and there
20:01 were some other elements but the reason
20:03 why I made the episode was just it was
20:05 in it was in me being intense was in me
20:09 you know it was like the reason why I've
20:11 succeeded the reason why I've had all
20:12 the careers I've had been all the places
20:14 I have met all the people I have it's
20:16 because I'm intense
20:18 and it was the most used word up to that
20:22 point of my life that people would
20:24 describe me if they got to meet me
20:25 personally you know first it's kind of
20:28 fun and games and then it's like oh wow
20:32 okay
20:33 that's intense you know and some of its
20:35 just it's not the things that are saying
20:39 by any means sometimes it's just you
20:41 want to come out and have a drink you
20:43 want to come out party you want to do
20:44 this and do that and I'm just like no
20:45 I'm writing a movie and I'm doing that
20:49 looking for some work over here and I'm
20:50 working on a new invention over here and
20:52 it just they see my life just chopped up
20:54 into all these pieces creating things
20:58 what I find interesting today is that
21:00 you it's not terribly difficult to find
21:03 people with a very thin skin they're
21:05 extremely fragile they have they get
21:08 offended very easily and what's weird
21:10 for me is that we've been at war now for
21:12 nearly you know 18 years really it's a
21:16 15 years technically speaking but think
21:18 about it we have been in some kind of
21:20 middle Easterns squabble due to these
21:23 bankers for a really long time we've
21:27 seen horrific things as of 2001 that the
21:31 world had never seen before it's no
21:34 longer that 1941 incident it's a 2001
21:37 incident and it's right in our face and
21:40 then we see the repercussions of the
21:42 event and you know there's all these ffs
21:45 all over the place or people are maybe
21:48 dying totally dying we don't know so for
21:52 me it blows my mind that people can live
21:54 in this world and still remain so
21:56 fragile how again when I grew up in the
22:02 70s and all the fathers and uncles were
22:04 and even their grandmothers and mothers
22:06 were very stoic it's because they grew
22:09 up in the depression they grew up in
22:11 World War two nuclear era Vietnam or
22:14 sorry Korea Vietnam these they went
22:16 through that whole thing and they
22:19 couldn't rely on living the next day
22:21 because the government and the global
22:24 controllers wanted to make everyone fear
22:28 life they feared their government
22:31 I mean it was and then by the 70s you
22:35 know when these satanic churches started
22:36 moving into every city and kidnapping
22:39 people then we had the milk cartons with
22:41 all the kids faces on them and that's
22:43 when the pedophile started really
22:44 getting control over everything
22:46 those kids were never found because they
22:48 were all sacrificed and again I'll say
22:53 it I've said it several times I'm gonna
22:54 say it again repeat this one putting
22:57 missing kids on milk cartons is the most
23:00 satanic [ __ ] thing you could possibly
23:02 do first and foremost a child is not
23:05 going to be the best you know eyes and
23:08 ears of the world if this kids been
23:09 kidnapped the last [ __ ] things gonna
23:11 happen he's gonna come back to school
23:13 he's often some ranch somewhere with
23:16 some pedophile
23:17 you know alphabet Agency dude or some
23:19 senator bird or farmer president or
23:22 something touching him and killing him
23:24 or whatever little kids don't need to be
23:27 reinforced that hey your life is
23:28 dangerous you could be kidnapped any
23:31 minute of the day how do you behave if
23:34 you have thick skin what does that
23:36 really translate to what's the
23:37 definition of that whole thing well the
23:40 goal of life in my opinion is to remain
23:42 as lucid as possible meaning there's
23:46 nothing that some there's nothing that
23:48 anyone can tell you where you say well I
23:50 don't think I can hear you say that or I
23:53 don't think I can look at that evidence
23:54 because I am so utterly in this one
23:57 category indoctrinated I can't go there
24:01 now caveat if someone was at a location
24:06 and saw something with their own eyes
24:07 and then you're trying to give them some
24:09 propaganda journalism that says it was
24:13 different than what they saw
24:14 I could understand the resistance it
24:17 still may be value in that maybe that
24:18 the tense of what they thought they were
24:20 seeing is not the same so you're trying
24:23 to correct you know you were there I
24:24 understand but you were in a level of
24:26 trauma and what you were really seeing
24:27 was this think about everyone in New
24:29 York who really thought it was a sama
24:31 bin Laden throwing planes at at
24:33 buildings maybe maybe it was some
24:40 neo-cons
24:42 but I think that in life you want to be
24:44 as lucid as possible have all the
24:46 information sort through it never stop
24:49 because you're never done but the other
24:51 thing is is you don't want to lose
24:53 control of your brain and if you're
24:55 super sensitive you're going to lose
24:57 control of your brain and trauma is the
25:00 is the most I mean trauma can help save
25:03 your life
25:04 if you're in the middle of a situation
25:05 and you're a participant in the process
25:08 of either saving your own life or saving
25:10 someone else's life traumas that shut
25:12 down the right brain hemisphere get out
25:15 of your creativity mode go to your left
25:17 brain survival circuits and use logic to
25:20 survive in that particular case I think
25:22 a trauma is a is a food group that is
25:25 necessity to surviving but if you're
25:29 just enjoying your day and someone wants
25:31 to run in and tell you that you know a
25:33 plane fell out of the sky somewhere or
25:35 celebrity died and you know these folks
25:37 that really get off on a bunch of
25:39 negative news and that particular piece
25:41 of news is gonna throw you into trauma
25:42 and ruin your day and ruin your night
25:45 but it has nothing to do with your life
25:47 personally you're just feeling empathy
25:50 for others then I don't think you really
25:53 want that to to take over your life for
25:57 that particular day let's say you're in
26:00 you're in public you want to have a
26:04 drink into your buddy you haven't seen
26:06 him for ten years you guys used to
26:09 always drink Guinness together and so
26:11 you go down to the pub a local bar and
26:14 you're just enjoying yourself
26:16 but there's the dude there who's had a
26:18 really bad life he's got even a worse
26:21 day by the time you got there the dude
26:24 was already 10 sheets to the wind and
26:28 for whatever reason the guys focusing on
26:31 you you and your buddy and eventually he
26:37 walks up to you guys and he starts
26:39 running his mouth all right
26:43 now what's interesting is most at the
26:45 time when I see this on the Internet the
26:48 men that I've seen deal with this are
26:50 phenomenal there's really two types of
26:52 ways we can look exactly the same be
26:54 complete different polarities there's
26:58 obviously the guy who's afraid of the
27:00 situation in a really bad way and so he
27:02 freezes up and gives basically yields
27:05 control to the [ __ ] that's dangerous
27:08 because the [ __ ] will take that
27:10 control because that's what he's really
27:12 trying to look at look for is he's lost
27:14 control of his own life and he's trying
27:15 to come over here and dominate you
27:18 because that gives him a foe impression
27:20 of being in control but now the only but
27:27 on the flip side the guy with the thick
27:28 skin let's just say you and your buddy
27:30 are the same the guys with the thick
27:33 skin they immediately read this dude and
27:37 they immediately say okay this guy's
27:39 obviously having a bad day so there's an
27:44 ethic in the world typically and a
27:47 bouncers are usually really good at this
27:48 too you don't be it up drunk people
27:50 because you're just easy targets I mean
27:53 it's like you don't kick someone when
27:55 they're down but that happens all the
27:56 [ __ ] time now like goddamn animals in
27:59 the world but there's not a counter
28:03 threat so the guy's threatening usually
28:06 the dudes that are grown up with a thick
28:09 skin they've seen a bunch of [ __ ] in
28:10 their lifetime they understand the
28:13 damage of the human body of slugging
28:15 someone in the face he's drunk a lot of
28:18 times people who are drunk can take a
28:20 lot of beating without getting really
28:21 physically hurt like you know those
28:23 drunks that walk out of car crashes
28:24 because they're so relaxed they never
28:26 tensed up and broke a bone but I've seen
28:30 some remarkable restraint from some
28:32 amazing people both on the internet and
28:34 both in real life especially by bouncers
28:37 or my buddies that are big dudes and
28:40 they will typically smile they won't
28:46 offer him another drink or anything that
28:47 used to be an old technique for a person
28:49 he was just slightly wasted they you
28:52 would just pawn them off onto the bar
28:53 and you say well let me get you a drink
28:55 and the guy would kind of
28:57 Kait man you know and then you get them
28:58 a drink and then you leave so they're
28:59 sipping on the drink and you're out of
29:02 there and you stick it to the bar the
29:06 bar it got a deal with this guy for not
29:07 dealing with him initially again there's
29:10 no bar out there with the bouncer that's
29:12 capable of handling the crowd that would
29:14 allow this example to go much more than
29:16 a few seconds but this [ __ ] happens and
29:18 you can't have control over everything
29:21 but usually someone is being super aggro
29:24 is looking for a response from you
29:25 because they want to play off your
29:27 response you call him a name boy I got
29:31 the next name for you you challenge them
29:34 to a fight that's really kind of they've
29:36 just got this you know once people are
29:38 drunk half the time they're fun when
29:41 they have the good time the other half
29:43 their body's saying we are under attack
29:47 just imagine bunch of people in your
29:49 brain who can't really make out what's
29:51 going on up there and they say attack
29:53 attack attack get this thing off of us
29:56 and that's when you get your really
29:58 pissed off drunk and here in Orange
30:02 County I've got buddies of mine that
30:06 have been police officers at times sell
30:08 a very celebrated police officers have
30:10 been prison guards and so they've dealt
30:11 with a lot of really tumultuous
30:14 situations which go all the way to the
30:17 limit and when they would tell me about
30:22 what happened in particular instances I
30:24 would interview them about how they
30:26 either defuse the situation or dealt
30:29 with it when it just simply couldn't be
30:31 diffused like someone just wouldn't let
30:33 go during some you know dispute at a bar
30:36 and again it's what's crazy is you know
30:38 a dispute at a bar half the time you
30:40 don't know the individual at all and
30:41 that's sort of the basis of the fight
30:43 it's interesting but are given this bar
30:47 example first for a reason you know
30:52 hopefully you never have to go to blows
30:53 again beating up a drunk person it's
30:55 pretty easy not gonna mount may be a
30:57 little more difficult but who knows but
31:00 now let's say that that was a Saturday
31:03 night Saturday night this happens to you
31:07 your buddy you're just there and you see
31:09 it
31:10 and you see the intensity in the loss
31:13 and the damage of someone losing control
31:15 of their life
31:17 now hopefully you get to see something
31:20 that's that's endearing the guy walks up
31:24 to you and is rude and whatever or a
31:26 little edgy and then you say what's
31:31 wrong buddy and the dude just crumbles
31:35 sits down with you just starts saying I
31:39 [ __ ] sorry ma'am old lady you know I
31:41 pissed her off or whatever I got drunk
31:43 she did this she cheated on me or
31:45 whatever my business partner this and
31:46 that I mean to blame women and the guy
31:48 just repents and confesses I've seen
31:53 that happen as well various forms of
31:55 that but then Monday comes around and
31:58 you got to go to work
31:59 and let's say you go to work and
32:02 something's going wrong some employee on
32:05 your team dropped the ball maybe they
32:09 dropped the ball by being negligent
32:11 maybe they just simply couldn't get done
32:13 what they needed to get done and now
32:14 your big boss is gonna come around maybe
32:17 you're in charge and it's your client
32:19 coming around they're expecting a
32:20 deliverable it's Monday morning and it
32:22 didn't get out the door but now you are
32:26 front and center
32:27 taking the slings and arrows of that
32:29 outrageous misfortune and now you have
32:33 to deal with it but you've had this bar
32:36 thing that you just saw could have been
32:40 a life-and-death situation in today's
32:41 ridiculous mm a [ __ ] steroid it out
32:44 dudes who just you know they take all
32:46 this training and just like the military
32:48 if you buy a bunch of missiles you're
32:50 gonna have to create a reason to drop
32:51 them otherwise you're gonna have to
32:52 retire them and you know disassemble
32:54 them and and you know there's only so
32:56 much training you can do but because you
33:00 saw this thing on Saturday you have
33:03 slightly thicker skin on Monday it could
33:06 be a temporary thing could be a
33:07 life-changing experience for you it
33:11 might personal experience interviewing
33:13 folks seeing things and dealing with
33:15 things personally
33:16 they're almost all life-changing
33:17 experiences I've got an episode that it
33:23 the youtubes demonetized it's called
33:25 small-town values I mean can you imagine
33:28 that this is not appropriate for
33:29 advertisers okay so the kids the kids
33:32 slinging fake [ __ ] and the urinals
33:35 that's fully monetizable and you know a
33:37 little bit of wisdom from a small town
33:39 it's just heinous unbelievable you know
33:43 it's gonna be funny about this whole
33:44 censorship thing from YouTube and Google
33:46 and all these [ __ ] here's what's
33:50 gonna happen they're going to get broken
33:54 up and they're going to be sued out of
33:56 their [ __ ] mind for for censorship
33:58 and you know what's gonna happen is
34:01 second that there's pressure put on them
34:03 they're gonna want us to save them
34:05 they're gonna want us to feel sympathy
34:07 for them but the entire time they're
34:09 shutting down channels in hell this
34:11 channel may not even exist in a couple
34:12 months if they start gagging you know
34:15 conspiracy theories they're gonna want
34:18 our sympathy and they're not gonna have
34:20 it and hopefully kim.com
34:23 delivers because [ __ ] you ain't
34:27 delivering and Brighton ain't delivering
34:29 a little update there for you guys
34:32 neither one of those platforms work at
34:35 all but now the other one is sort of a
34:40 reverse experience for whatever reason
34:45 in your life you are the drunk that
34:47 walked up to someone and this is all
34:48 metaphor just so you understand you've
34:51 lost your [ __ ] you have just had a
34:54 consecutive amount of bad days of sleep
34:57 perhaps you're struggling with a cold or
34:59 something maybe you've lost someone in
35:02 your life whether it be a relationship
35:03 or a death you are just in a bad spot in
35:06 your life and just understand valleys
35:08 turn into mountains and you know if
35:11 you're on the bottom it is true it is
35:13 absolutely a cliche that has a thousand
35:15 percent truth where can you go from the
35:18 bottom you can only go up time heals all
35:22 it's true true true okay but when you're
35:26 down there none of that [ __ ] matters
35:28 because you're dealing with that little
35:30 cesspool of existence in your own mind
35:33 again in most of it's all a thousand
35:35 percent perception in your
35:36 although certain events are so intense
35:39 it takes more than just a pat on the
35:41 back and everything's gonna be okay
35:42 statement to get out of that funk now I
35:46 wish I could give you a personal example
35:48 I'm trying to stretch my brain here and
35:51 I can't remember myself really doing
35:54 this I will usually the thing that
35:57 happens to me a lot is if I'm hanging
35:59 out with my buddies and this hasn't
36:00 happened for years but a couple reunions
36:03 ago we had two guys one of them got
36:08 really wasted at the bar and he's at the
36:13 time he must have weighed almost 400
36:15 pounds kids five foot seven at best and
36:18 another buddy of mine it's like one of
36:21 those super popular guys and just he's a
36:23 very chameleon kind of dude he gets
36:26 along with everybody and he's a real
36:29 jokester and he's actually super funny
36:30 he's super fit big guy and he's best
36:36 friends with this dude at the bar I mean
36:38 over time they've never lost their
36:40 closeness and for whatever reason he
36:43 said something and set this guy off and
36:49 you know the bigger guy was a Mexican
36:51 kid and the other dudes I guess you're
36:53 Caucasian white guy and somehow when I
36:56 walked up I walk up to this to the bar
36:58 and it's pretty late at night and it's
37:00 one of these kind of odd locations where
37:02 people don't usually drink and he is
37:08 saying something like you know you're
37:09 always saying that you're always saying
37:11 I'm a Mexican or whatever and I want you
37:14 to stop it
37:14 and the other guys like what are you
37:16 talking about you know I hate kids I
37:19 don't talk in any racial terms I don't
37:22 deal with the kids of all races all day
37:24 long and he can't understand how the
37:26 other guy got confused that he was being
37:28 racist and again in my hometown there's
37:31 just a handful of people I've ever run
37:33 into that ever ever said anything
37:35 remotely racist and I know that this
37:38 dude is not one of them for sure it's so
37:41 he just keeps getting more and more
37:42 angry than more my buddy continues
37:44 trying to apologize because he wants to
37:46 hang on to his narrative that he has
37:47 been defiled racially and of course
37:50 drunk out of his ass when he when he
37:52 gets sober he would never behave that
37:54 way and and they did make up the next
37:56 day and so I walk up I just walked right
37:59 into the middle of this whole thing this
38:00 is really just the three of us in this
38:02 building and so I I just grabbed the
38:08 first guy the big dude who's sober I
38:10 don't even think he drinks a nice to do
38:14 just just go outside just go outside and
38:17 so then I just sat at the bar and I just
38:19 said what's up guy what's up buddy I
38:21 won't say his name here but I said his
38:23 name and they so he explained it to me
38:26 that he thought that this you know
38:28 so-and-so was being Rison I said dude
38:29 you know he loves you to death he would
38:31 never do that to you and if and if
38:33 whatever reason he told a joke or
38:35 something you know it's because he loves
38:37 you and he thinks that you would think
38:38 it was funny but I you know but I didn't
38:41 want to say you know you're wrong you're
38:43 wrong you're wrong cuz the guy's drunk
38:44 you're just start getting mad at me but
38:48 I got the guy calmed down then one of
38:51 his relatives the female came in grabbed
38:53 him pulled him out and everything was
38:55 okay
38:57 now if I hadn't had a thick skin and had
39:00 my sober buddy had not had a thick skin
39:02 this could have turned into a hellish
39:04 situation at least relative to those two
39:08 guys things could have been said could
39:10 have come to blows and it would have
39:12 been bad but instead the very next day
39:15 which this was a Friday and you know
39:17 everyone meets on a Friday and then we
39:18 have our reunion on the Saturday
39:21 everything was fine the next day except
39:23 for that kid was a little hungover that
39:25 was about it
39:27 now let's go to youtube man oh man the
39:33 butthurt that came out of those two Flat
39:35 Earth videos was [ __ ] palpable
39:39 unbelievable I thought people would be
39:41 excited different cuz I haven't weighed
39:43 in on the flatterer thing in a really
39:44 long time I haven't and now I put out
39:48 the first two videos I think this season
39:51 I think maybe I have one at the very
39:54 beginning I didn't think I'd do that
39:57 people were just [ __ ] all over
40:01 themselves there's no other way to say
40:02 it I mean grown men
40:04 coming in and and then one of the
40:06 funniest comments was a dude saying when
40:09 are you gonna get off this [ __ ] Flat
40:11 Earth stuff wait okay so I do pepper
40:16 episodes with the acknowledgement of
40:19 that community I do but I don't go deep
40:25 into it and I especially don't devote
40:27 entire episodes to it and so the irony
40:31 of it was that the episodes were really
40:33 geared towards especially the battle for
40:36 Flat Earth the whole thing was geared
40:38 towards this animosity between opinions
40:43 and so I guess these guys listen to five
40:45 minutes maybe didn't even listen to it
40:47 they type a comment in and the episode
40:50 is about their comment it's about the
40:51 the archetype of their ass hurtness or
40:56 something man it just blew me away
40:59 when it comes to conspiracy theories or
41:02 I really don't want to call them
41:04 conspiracy theories but it seems like
41:06 when someone says a is right and B is
41:09 right but a and B can't exist at the
41:11 same time you have two different groups
41:13 right then one of them I guess is a
41:16 conspiracy maybe if you are getting
41:21 visceral about a situation that you know
41:26 in terms of doing harm that's art that's
41:28 our motto on this show right doodle harm
41:32 yes you could construe a conspiracy into
41:36 its most intense impact again some folks
41:41 that believe in Flat Earth totally go
41:43 the Christian firmament route which is
41:45 other religions before that and so they
41:48 believe that the anyone that's teaching
41:50 new globe ism is removing you from God
41:53 like I said in the episode all right
41:55 okay and the ones who believe it's a
41:59 globe to think that people are trying to
42:01 make their children stupid by believing
42:03 it's a flat disk or a concave disc or
42:06 whatever all right
42:09 I would like to see it approach from a
42:11 thicker skin standpoint the race is on
42:16 smile right when Mike Tyson at 16 years
42:20 old knocked this dude out in the
42:22 Olympics utterly knocked him down twice
42:26 he's 16 years old it looks like he's 30
42:29 old monster he immediately walked over
42:32 because he had class and he hugged the
42:34 guy and might usually did that for
42:37 almost all of his opponents why because
42:42 the game is a game it's me against you
42:45 the way Mike thought about it and he's
42:47 like I am going to destroy you that's
42:49 what I that's what I do and part of
42:52 that's that he's admitted this 100 times
42:54 you know it's part of the insecurity of
42:56 how he grew up it's also the way to win
42:57 the fight you don't want to put some
42:59 maybe I win you know that's not the
43:01 opinion of a guy he's gonna go in to win
43:03 a purse that's worth a hundred million
43:05 dollars or thirty million dollars in a
43:07 particular fight you got to go in and
43:08 convince your promoters that you're here
43:11 to win with us in the conspiracy realm
43:16 for me it's like we are asking the other
43:20 group if you don't believe what they
43:22 believe it seems like none of you
43:25 believe in expanding earth it just blows
43:26 my mind that you [ __ ] watch that
43:28 video for Neil Adams you go that's
43:29 [ __ ] it's like is it is it god damn
43:34 it's the first physical [ __ ] model of
43:36 the surface of the earth that makes
43:37 complete goddamn sense right in front of
43:38 your face mathematically makes sense and
43:40 it's not true I just think that's funny
43:43 but all of you don't believe I don't go
43:45 home crying in my pillow at night holy
43:47 [ __ ]
43:49 and the only thing that kind of is
43:51 unfortunate I think it's it's a sad
43:53 epitaph to society is the folks that
43:55 come into the comment section which are
43:57 very very rare and they're just they're
44:00 so distraught oh my god you know this
44:03 whole thing is so intense for them they
44:06 can't be nice you know and you're kind
44:08 of going really you know like I respect
44:12 your passion with Jesus like don't don't
44:15 get to a point in my opinion you don't
44:17 want to get to a point where you go home
44:18 and beat your children because of you
44:20 know disagreement online or something
44:22 you don't want to lose sleep over it hey
44:25 if you want to prove your point of view
44:28 but then again we're missing a shit-ton
44:30 evidence on the flat side we're missing
44:32 a [ __ ] ton of evidence on the globe side
44:33 and so go do your homework I mean take
44:38 all their energy and put it into proofs
44:40 of one way or the other by the way the I
44:48 finally found an answer for you guys cuz
44:50 someone said and it's really weird cuz
44:52 YouTube put the comment on the wrong put
44:54 my response on the wrong comment on
44:56 first I thought was bizarre the mobile
44:58 apps got a lot of issues for mobile
45:00 YouTube Studios got lots of issues the
45:03 mobile app for the Android overall a
45:06 great app but it's got some issues
45:07 so anyway guy said you know it's this
45:09 whole thing about water bending water
45:12 doesn't Bend man show me to show me a he
45:16 said show me an example of water bending
45:18 or can you bend water something like
45:19 that I'm like okay a bubble a bubble is
45:23 water bending in a sphere there you go
45:26 and you could say well that's not cuz
45:29 that's a bubble it's like okay it's a
45:31 planet and it's ether there you go same
45:34 exact laws of physics different
45:37 substances being at different densities
45:39 that's only water is really dense
45:40 particles of ether that have turned into
45:43 hydrogen and oxygen that's it same exact
45:48 spinning little cores now in the modern
45:52 era between men and women the Mars and
45:55 Venus argument was just a very
45:57 interesting thing going on here it used
46:00 to be that when I was young the women
46:04 were only mildly more emotional than the
46:08 men your parents were fairly stoic your
46:11 grandparents usually even more stoic
46:13 they had seen more [ __ ] they've been
46:16 through all kinds of things me my
46:17 grandmother on my dad's side was 10
46:20 years older than my grandmother on my
46:21 mom's side and so she had lived through
46:26 the depression as an ascent adult
46:31 and so for her the me sitting around in
46:35 a beautiful little country town with all
46:38 the amenities of life I could possibly
46:40 want I never wondered where my food was
46:43 coming from where my clothing was coming
46:46 from whether I'd have shelter no one had
46:50 to stand on the corner selling pencils I
46:53 never had a santa stayin in his soup
46:55 line my grandmother looked at my life
46:57 I'm sure I just thought well I'm glad
47:00 that this is the case because I don't
47:02 want my grandkid to grow up in the world
47:04 I grew up in when I was his age I never
47:08 asked my grandmother if she thought any
47:10 of her destiny was robbed from her
47:13 because she's born in 1912 so when she
47:18 was about 1929 she had decided to become
47:20 a teacher and she was a great teacher
47:23 and she was heavily celebrated so I
47:25 think she got the life she wanted but
47:27 surely people that were in the middle of
47:29 the 30s trying to do something really
47:31 remarkable a lot of those destinies got
47:34 destroyed like I've said several times
47:37 we have a family friend who was a
47:39 Vietnam vet and helicopter pilot he was
47:42 shot down five times he managed to save
47:44 I think almost everyone's life and each
47:46 one of the crashes because he knew how
47:48 to you know how to do that his
47:50 helicopter now is in the Smithsonian on
47:51 display he's a badass [ __ ] let
47:54 me tell you he was capable of turning on
47:59 a level of a thick-skinned and stoic
48:01 behavior that was monstrously amazing
48:05 like he just it was like shouting by not
48:08 saying anything it's sort of his trigger
48:11 he could turn on but at the same time he
48:15 could flick a switch and have the most
48:17 fun of anyone he got all these sons well
48:20 he had any daughters he have five sons
48:22 any end up losing his hair really fast
48:25 when he was young and I think eventually
48:27 in his 50s
48:29 definitely by his 60s he mean he got a
48:31 hairpiece he just wanted hair back he
48:33 just wanted to try it and so he had
48:34 someone make him a wig and my dad also
48:37 lost his hair fairly soon not quite as
48:40 quite as shiny as his buddy
48:42 but I remember being at a
48:44 Picnic once and he takes his hair off
48:48 and puts it on my dad and we took a
48:50 bunch of photographs in a movie of them
48:51 just trading this hairpiece back and boy
48:53 it was absolutely hysterical so he
48:55 didn't lose his heart he didn't lose his
48:57 soul but by God that dude's all [ __ ]
48:59 that none of us should ever see
49:04 experienced things that were horrifying
49:07 at a level that would take your average
49:09 human being thinks they've seen
49:11 something scary and just make them soil
49:13 themselves Sir Robin wouldn't make it
49:19 you know that I've said a hundred times
49:21 on the show I want you guys to have
49:22 control of your life I want you to get
49:24 the destinies that you want and I want
49:26 you to be able to traverse traumatic
49:28 events successfully I don't want you
49:32 getting inside PTSD and if you do have a
49:34 PTSD moment whether you be a soldier
49:36 that really experienced war or you've
49:39 just had several traumatic events in
49:41 your life of which you've lost track of
49:42 the actual origin of the event that's
49:45 that's what PTSD is I want you to be
49:48 able to use little tiny techniques to
49:51 get yourself back in control to your
49:54 heart's content we have the privileged
49:58 now and it has nothing to do with white
50:00 people
50:01 we've got races of all creeds in fact I
50:05 think white people might start might be
50:08 going down the ramp of ranking when it
50:12 comes to which race is more privileged
50:17 but it doesn't matter everyone goes
50:19 through stuff but the Venus March thing
50:23 the thing between the women and the men
50:24 in the 21st century what I find
50:30 extremely ironic is that women typically
50:32 in this day and age if you're in your
50:36 20s you're trying to date safe you're
50:39 trying to date the guy that makes you
50:41 feel warm and fuzzy when you get into
50:44 your 40s you want the guy that can kick
50:47 ass and take names and provide through
50:50 the most incredible crises that could
50:52 happen to the family
50:56 they're always gonna have a job in a
50:58 recession to the degree the world gets
51:01 scary because of terrorist attacks or
51:05 some crazy event that's been
51:07 orchestrated by the deep state you want
51:11 to feel secure for women that really
51:14 focus on children they want if they have
51:16 sons they want their father to be a
51:18 strong man to raise a boy to be a man
51:21 and you know there's plenty of things
51:24 that a father can teach a daughter if
51:29 anything warned the daughter about how
51:30 boys think right but I think that when I
51:34 was a kid the women would go after that
51:37 that mid to late forties algorithm at 18
51:42 years old they wanted to find a guy
51:45 which is obviously a kid who is suiting
51:49 that education from a father figure
51:52 doesn't have to be your dad could be
51:55 your dad's best friend could be your
51:56 uncle it could be a bit your best
51:59 friend's father right like Robert
52:02 Kiyosaki I think we used to live between
52:06 1975 and 1990 there were very few crises
52:11 in the world on the average American at
52:14 least soil culture and so when you have
52:19 that lack of threat which is the way we
52:22 need the world to be everyone starts to
52:25 get a little softer how many times have
52:28 you ever dialed back into say Robin
52:31 Williams routines in the early 80s or
52:34 Mork was it Mork and Mindy in the early
52:37 80s and you watch those episodes you
52:39 watch mash or you watch cheers and you
52:42 watch those little shows and you realize
52:43 how soft and cuddly and nice everybody
52:46 was you watch guys dance disco and
52:50 you're like wow there's anything but
52:52 masculinity in that dance style but it
52:55 was great it was cool and it was
52:57 masculine for the time now I mentioned
53:01 the warriors of my other episode and I
53:05 remember seeing that movie in 1979 and
53:07 then watching it again
53:10 you know thirty years later after seeing
53:11 the movie probably 200 times as a kid
53:13 and noticing that the big arc in the
53:16 story was that the Rogues had a gun
53:18 they shot Cyrus but every single person
53:22 that chased down the Warriors as they
53:26 made it from the Bronx to Coney Island
53:28 it was baseball bats chains fistfights
53:32 it was not this I'm going to kill you
53:35 thing well what if you showed warriors
53:38 to any of the guys and he the
53:40 gangbangers that went through the 90's
53:42 in Los Angeles or the 80s they would
53:45 laugh their asses off because it was all
53:47 guns it was all death thankfully that's
53:51 lightened up quite a bit around here but
53:55 that is the weapon of choice today in
53:57 our brains
53:59 they got intense it got hard that's what
54:03 an alphabet agency can do to a ghetto to
54:06 a society that we were stupid back in
54:10 those days and in a way that it wasn't I
54:12 should say stupid we were ignorant back
54:14 in those days and we were following
54:15 their lead constantly thinking all this
54:17 was organic and it wasn't so today we're
54:22 all hard and there's a difference
54:25 between thick-skinned and being hard the
54:30 being hard thing is something I see a
54:32 lot in the big city I think it's
54:34 lightening up a little bit and it with
54:35 strangers I see the hardness in one
54:38 group of folks and then I see this total
54:40 femininity and another group of folks
54:42 and they're kind of the same age so in
54:45 Orange County California we've got
54:46 boroughs that are looking for fights
54:49 24/7 they drive the big pickup trucks
54:51 they they're just always looking over
54:55 their shoulder to start [ __ ] that's
54:59 really sad and then we have the guys
55:01 running around in capri pants and
55:03 they're straight but they're just really
55:05 feminine they're beta males and so
55:08 you're kind of like you know you know
55:10 that they're not hurting anybody but
55:12 you're kind of looking at it going man
55:14 is that gonna pan out over the over the
55:17 long haul I'm seeing women go from
55:19 dating safe to divorcing and dating
55:23 completely
55:23 you know intense individuals now is this
55:28 a generational thing sure it is
55:31 absolutely absolutely it is when I was
55:35 young what I was told was that I am the
55:37 provider and on the protector I said
55:40 this in my chivalry episode many moons
55:42 ago how many times have you know fellas
55:47 let me just throw this at you and ladies
55:49 you're probably going to smile and laugh
55:51 a little bit how many times have you
55:54 heard a woman say the most attractive
55:56 thing in a male is confidence confidence
56:01 that you can handle the situation you
56:02 can handle a social event where two guys
56:05 are added at a bar with Italy or your
56:08 friends you don't walk up to strangers
56:09 and do that [ __ ] just [ __ ] walk away
56:10 you're not gonna solve any problems
56:12 there now if you're six foot eight and
56:14 you're a [ __ ] MMA champion and you
56:16 think you could you know wrap these guys
56:18 around your fingers maybe you can get
56:19 involved but I'll leave that to you but
56:22 again the economy gets bad they know
56:24 you're gonna scrap and make cash your
56:27 kid let's just say you know you have
56:30 children and children some children are
56:31 really well behaved I got a really good
56:34 kid like that I was like that when I was
56:36 a kid so wasn't a big high-impact
56:37 problem but then you'll have kids with
56:41 great parents and for whatever reason
56:42 they are just rebellious and they are
56:46 trying to find their way in life trying
56:48 to find their love in life and for
56:51 whatever reason they're not finding it
56:53 and the women have an instinct now some
56:57 women can handle this stuff all by
56:58 themselves and I'm not trying to take
56:59 away that situation from the quality of
57:02 great moms but a lot of times they're
57:05 like okay I need you to do your half
57:06 husband you need to do your half and get
57:09 in there and well hopefully the whole
57:11 mechanism as I mentioned in my parenting
57:13 episode many moons ago you start
57:16 parenting from the second your child is
57:17 born you do not wait for crises to
57:19 happen and your kid to get upset you
57:21 don't pay attention to your kid
57:22 the second they have all these problems
57:23 you pay attention the whole time and
57:25 you're guiding them the whole time and
57:27 you're not dominating their life and
57:30 controlling everything that they do but
57:31 you're just kind of like let's go this
57:33 way
57:34 don't put your finger in there let's go
57:35 this way
57:37 no don't disrespect your father your
57:39 mother this way but in my experience
57:43 that's what women are looking for
57:45 sometimes families get separated
57:49 sometimes the men never stick around and
57:51 so the woman has to become Emma dextrous
57:56 between the male and the female thing
57:58 and they try to do their very best and
58:01 then if they date someone that's
58:03 interested in them then they will sort
58:07 of lean on them during the relationship
58:08 to say could you help me with my kid
58:10 who's either you know your gender so the
58:12 male might have a daughter and they want
58:14 to have some more mentorship I had that
58:18 happen to me but I dated a really strong
58:21 female was like hey could you put this
58:23 you know put some technique into my
58:25 daughter's life and sometimes it works
58:27 and sometimes it doesn't work but I've
58:30 definitely had it happen the opposite
58:31 way as well in the end thick skin what
58:36 I'm talking about here is your ability
58:38 to deal with anything rationally
58:42 productively and fairly immediate and
58:46 the more that you triage things in life
58:50 and you fix things very quickly the more
58:53 your confidence will simply become you
58:55 because nothing will scare you and even
58:58 if it's something you've never dealt
58:59 with in your life you're sitting there
59:00 thinking to yourself well I'm a smart
59:02 person I'm very resourceful I'm very
59:04 much like MacGyver in a way and so I'm
59:09 going to be able to handle whatever is
59:11 there to the best of my ability with the
59:14 amount of knowledge I have at that exact
59:16 moment of course after the moment you
59:19 become more talented so it just becomes
59:21 this sort of insatiable loop where you
59:26 learn and you become invincible and
59:28 amazing I want that for every single one
59:31 of you and I know that some of you
59:34 dominate constantly and I'll tell you
59:38 what you know it's you know there's
59:42 these moments when I think about these
59:44 kind of problems and I think well some
59:46 folks are extremely impressive and some
59:50 people get it right
59:51 and it's not as impressive what do I
59:53 mean well I've had friends of mine that
59:57 have perfect fathers and mothers and
59:59 they sometimes that's actually results
60:04 in kids with less success as per their
60:07 own definition they weren't as
60:10 successful you know I know friends that
60:13 were rich their whole life so I wouldn't
60:14 say rich as in you know driving around
60:19 Bentley's everywhere but they always
60:20 have whatever they wanted if they wanted
60:22 a computer mom and dad would just take
60:24 him down and get him the computer and
60:25 they had it and sometimes being able to
60:29 have everything that you want the second
60:30 that you want it doesn't work out and
60:32 other times your parents will go okay
60:36 well then you need to work hard mow
60:37 lawns we'll do whatever you got to do to
60:39 make money work for the family and we'll
60:41 give you some cash and then you can have
60:43 what you want and then that thing is a
60:45 rare thing in the house that's my whole
60:48 life you know I mean I had to mow lawns
60:50 work at department stores movie theaters
60:53 to make my cash I would always sell
60:56 something on the side to make cash
60:58 artwork or greeting cards when I was a
61:01 kid my own art so everything I got was a
61:06 big deal I had to mow lawns to raise
61:10 money to buy a lawn mower to mow my lawn
61:12 I'm here that's how [ __ ] up that was
61:15 imagine being a 15 year old kid in 1985
61:18 or 84 whatever it was and having to go
61:21 out and make 350 bucks to buy a lawn
61:23 mower it toughened me up so there's some
61:30 of you that have had a tough going of
61:32 life perhaps you had parents that
61:35 weren't really present they were there
61:37 physically but they weren't present in
61:39 your life sometimes you can have a
61:41 parent that is up your ass constantly
61:44 that can be a problem so you're trying
61:46 to succeed and your parents trying to
61:47 make you fail I dealt with that a lot of
61:50 my life
61:50 but I tell you what in the end when I
61:53 broke free and I had to break free by my
61:55 own means life was a almost a cakewalk
62:01 now there were things that I didn't have
62:05 any knowledge about or I was really poor
62:06 at them I think between the age of like
62:09 eighteen and I'd say 20 the amount of
62:14 times I had to pay an ATM overdraft fee
62:17 or you know my checkbook bounced or
62:19 whatever cuz I was just flopping back
62:21 and forth between making a ton of money
62:23 and spending too much money getting in a
62:25 car wreck some kid hit me from behind
62:26 had to cough up cash to keep my car
62:28 running it made me a better person in
62:32 the end so sometimes when you're
62:34 suffering man you're becoming more
62:37 powerful by the second cuz think about
62:41 it what's gonna shake you after all that
62:43 not much cuz you've been to it all
62:45 you've been through all the archetypes
62:47 the themes of life trying and when you
62:50 write a script which are supposed to do
62:51 is take the main character and give them
62:54 a goal that the audience can understand
62:56 I need to get to Los Angeles I'm in
62:59 Omaha Nebraska and I need to get to Los
63:02 Angeles that's my goal cuz something's
63:03 waiting for me there okay great and as
63:06 they try to get to Los Angeles depending
63:08 how you want to write your film it could
63:09 be a film all about the journey to get
63:11 to Los Angeles in the third act or
63:13 fourth act depending how you're right is
63:14 something that happens they finally get
63:17 this thing but in the end it would be
63:20 the car flubs out you know a hundred
63:24 miles outside of town or two or 300
63:26 miles outside of town it's it's really
63:29 planes trains and automobiles with John
63:32 Candy and Steve Martin and it's called a
63:35 gap if you were trying to walk down the
63:38 street and an earthquake happened and
63:40 the land is so far apart in a big tear
63:43 that's you know miles long you have a
63:46 gap and you have to find another way to
63:48 get from the side you're on to the other
63:50 side with a ladder with some technique
63:53 you know get it get in a plane and fly
63:55 over jump a car over jump a motorcycle
63:57 over it you know again that San Andreas
64:00 movie with Rock the rock
64:02 they actually had a literal gap you know
64:04 in the movie which I thought was
64:05 hysterical but life is full of gaps
64:08 isn't it you just needed that phone call
64:11 to get that opportunity and it's not
64:14 coming and so you got to go
64:15 and whatever resource that that meeting
64:18 is going to require there's the old
64:21 story about Steven Spielberg sneaking
64:25 onto the lot and sneaking into a
64:27 producers office and throwing down his
64:30 reel and saying I want a job here I want
64:32 to work in Hollywood and that's how he
64:35 got his opportunity no way that's true
64:37 or not I don't know I think it is you
64:41 know there's all the bands in the 80s
64:42 that went around Sunset Boulevard
64:44 especially motley crew they talked about
64:46 putting their own fliers up everywhere
64:49 well at one point they were nobodies and
64:52 now there's somebody whether you like
64:55 them or not that's exactly what they did
64:56 to make it I think this is something
65:00 that people think about all the time but
65:01 we don't talk about it at all
65:03 at all I mean we may have a little
65:05 comment here and there about how
65:07 someone's acting too tough or someone's
65:09 acting too wimpy but how many times have
65:12 you had conversations well you take your
65:14 partner and you go to a party and you
65:18 with all your friends and someone is
65:20 crying in their beer they are flustered
65:24 and you and your partner looking at each
65:27 other going wow that doesn't seem like
65:29 that much of a crisis but I guess in
65:32 their perspective it's the end of the
65:33 world and so you get back in the car to
65:38 drive home and the whole conversation
65:39 driving home is wow could you believe
65:41 how disturbed he or she was with that
65:44 event amazing and then you know might be
65:46 one of these things of if two high
65:48 school sweethearts marry each other at
65:50 18 and have a pretty charm life until
65:52 about 35 or so and they get divorced or
65:54 even later then you thinking wow they've
65:57 never had they've never been experienced
66:00 a breakup before in their entire life
66:01 everything has been a bowl of cherries
66:03 it went exactly how the American Dream
66:05 was supposed to go up until that point
66:07 of divorce well you and your partner may
66:11 have been through 10 relationships may
66:12 have had your heart stomped out on the
66:14 ground and so for you it's nothing you
66:16 have thicker skin the thing that's
66:20 driving this episode and gave me the
66:21 idea this morning was a lot of the
66:23 responses to the Flat Earth controversy
66:26 online in making this show
66:29 I hope you understand that the amount of
66:32 theories I have to entertain both in in
66:35 mentioning them in episodes but outside
66:37 the show itself and all my circles of
66:40 buddies that that believe in a bunch of
66:43 different things it's it seems infinite
66:47 you know and so I'm very conditioned to
66:49 hear things that I don't believe I want
66:51 that for everybody because the Great
66:55 Awakening is going to demand it out of
66:57 us isn't it if we're all to get on the
67:01 same page then we're gonna have to
67:02 compare stories from all walks of life a
67:04 lot of history is made of Lies and so
67:09 some people have crutches that are
67:12 embedded in religion they're related
67:14 bedded into history and so to have that
67:17 dislodged out of your hand to be
67:19 enlightened which is your goal it could
67:22 be a son of a [ __ ] you're like well I
67:24 want to be enlightened but that means I
67:25 gotta let go this son of a [ __ ] I like
67:28 that thing fixed skin does not mean
67:31 you're stubborn either I don't know what
67:35 being stubborn is a quality outside of
67:39 perhaps holding to your morals you know
67:42 I've been wanting to mention this and I
67:44 guess I'll just throw it in right here
67:45 this is kind of a related non sequitur
67:49 but having been a fan of the artist
67:52 known as Prince and seeing him die to
67:56 potentially a fentanyl overdose and
67:59 again I don't know if he was murdered I
68:01 don't know there's some really weird
68:03 [ __ ] around his death with the
68:05 psychologist son with the backpack full
68:06 of drugs him dying on the floor in front
68:10 of the elevator in his basement in his
68:12 vault for me means he had no idea that
68:16 whatever he put in his body was going to
68:18 kill him but it just dawned on me about
68:23 a week ago that there was a song that
68:25 Prince wrote in the 90s called let it go
68:27 I think it was in the 90s it's a really
68:30 a fairly cool sounding song but a
68:32 concern to me now I followed two guys in
68:37 the 80s that both had a resistance
68:41 towards drugs and
68:42 and one of them was a demands and the
68:45 other one was Prince and I was fairly
68:46 proud that without knowing this about
68:48 them it there was just something about
68:51 them that their music and their style
68:53 right and a man-made pirate rock music
68:55 at punk music and no one will ever do
68:57 that again unless they're just
68:58 absolutely emulating that guy Prince
69:00 created music that sounded like no one
69:02 else's and so he was all into rock and
69:06 roll and sex you know he was into that
69:07 whole thing I'm sure out a man had his
69:09 own roll in the hay with that too at a
69:12 man made a song could called
69:14 goody-two-shoes because he was tired of
69:16 being ridiculed for his choices but then
69:20 prince in the 90s wrote a song called
69:21 let it go and the song's about he is
69:26 going to let go all of his sort of
69:28 uptightness when it comes to drinking I
69:31 think the drinking was and even drugs
69:34 he says everyone's getting high but me
69:35 something like that in lyrics and I got
69:39 concerned that that might not be a great
69:42 path for him because the kid who's never
69:44 done any of that before doesn't have
69:47 instincts about typically doesn't have
69:50 any instincts about what is too much
69:51 what is dangerous what is not dangerous
69:53 and regardless if he was murdered or he
69:57 did his own fentanyl injection again
70:00 this stuff is a hundred times more
70:01 powerful than morphine and Jesus I've
70:03 had morphine a couple times due to some
70:05 pain I've experienced in life and boy I
70:08 was happy as a clam man but he
70:11 compromised his integrity and he
70:13 potentially died of it because he was
70:14 definitely definitely strung out on
70:16 painkillers
70:17 he essentially died on that plane ride
70:20 back to Minnesota they had to do an
70:23 emergency landing I forgot what airport
70:24 it was but they had to literally rush
70:26 his body out and give him an adrenalin
70:28 shot to save his life as I understand it
70:29 and his girlfriend at the time is in the
70:32 plane with him she's describing this so
70:34 we can trust the story I think so being
70:40 stubborn to your principles is probably
70:44 a decent idea and I'm sure many of you
70:47 who believe the religion of choice in
70:50 your life it's probably not bad you go
70:54 ahead and remain stubborn if that's
70:56 where you
70:56 draw your morals from I think one can
71:00 achieve full-blown morals from the
71:02 parables of religion without actually
71:04 believing the stories to be real I think
71:07 that gives you sort of a left-right
71:11 brain fully functional mind because you
71:15 don't do believe fiction to understand
71:17 fact that's what I want for every single
71:20 one of you so I think you feel me
71:24 I don't beaten this up so I'm you're
71:27 gonna dig this most people won't even
71:28 watch it because of the title
71:31 hopefully this either confirms what you
71:35 already think or gives you a few tools
71:38 in your in your toolbox to deal with
71:41 life moving forward and gives you
71:42 something to think about a little bit
