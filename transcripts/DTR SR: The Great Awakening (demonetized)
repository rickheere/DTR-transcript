00:00 [Music]
00:33 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:35 gentlemen the technically speaking
00:38 season three is over so I don't know if
00:40 I'm gonna throw this out as a bonus
00:42 special reports or something in season
00:45 four it's been about three weeks since I
00:48 recorded still haven't kicked out all
00:52 the season three episodes down to one
00:54 more plus I got a couple more up my
00:57 sleeve for you guys on Facebook at least
01:00 one full-length episode for you guys
01:02 plus an index that'll be coming for
01:04 season three but tonight I feel like
01:07 recording I feel like going over a
01:08 subject that's I think near and dear to
01:10 all of us as you can see it's about the
01:13 Great Awakening the Great Awakening has
01:17 taken several stages and it's taken over
01:19 a decade to occur it was catalyzed by an
01:24 event where the hubris of those who
01:26 control the world had finally eclipsed
01:29 all logic I think I can safely say that
01:35 9/11 was the one thing that got everyone
01:39 over the hump of okay wait what'd you
01:42 say happened again I'm sure it started
01:45 off with a few hundred people they kept
01:48 talking to people it turned into a few
01:49 thousand people than ten thousand people
01:51 than a hundred thousand people than
01:53 hundreds of millions of people who saw
01:54 loose change let's not forget that the
01:57 movie released in 2005 called loose
02:01 change had hit over 250 million views
02:05 before YouTube took the count down to
02:08 zero and then it got back up again and
02:10 back up again
02:10 plus it was mirrored everywhere not to
02:12 mention how many see
02:13 where solar DVDs were sold of the film
02:16 how many times has been shown without
02:18 any count I'm willing to bet that movie
02:20 was viewed 1 billion times and on this
02:23 planet easy by new people
02:25 Michael Rupert was actually before that
02:28 I don't even know when his little movie
02:31 came out but he recorded a lecture at
02:32 the Oregon University in 2001 November
02:39 unbelievably ahead of his time
02:40 unfortunately for some reason he took
02:43 his life he believed a lot of things at
02:45 the end that I don't think were true his
02:48 heart was in the right place but now
02:51 we're inside the Great Awakening we are
02:55 the lucky ones well the game isn't
02:58 remotely too over yet as a matter of
03:01 fact we're still and I think the first
03:04 half of the second act of a three-act
03:06 play we're in that tumultuous 60 minutes
03:11 of the old fashioned writing style you
03:14 got to get 60 minutes we've set up the
03:15 whole thing we know what needs to happen
03:16 we know who needs to go down now we
03:19 wring cue baiting up all the evidence
03:21 cornering everyone that will legally
03:23 drop and hopefully we get an act 3 but
03:28 it's the Great Awakening that's making
03:29 this possible so what I want to do on
03:32 this episode because if you're watching
03:34 this you're probably of all kinds of
03:36 ages you come from all kinds of places
03:38 on the world you at least have two
03:42 different genders that we know of thing
03:45 to be listen to this thing and all that
03:47 matters because I want to take you back
03:50 about 20 years before 9/11 just so that
03:54 you can understand the full profoundness
03:58 of the situation I'm gonna reference
04:00 things way older than 20 years but the
04:04 world didn't use to suck so bad right I
04:07 made a several episodes on this one is
04:09 on the 1980s you can just go watch that
04:13 there's life before 9/11 it's another
04:17 episode I've done so you can lift these
04:19 things up you want to get into I'm not
04:21 going to totally regurgitate those but
04:23 what's important is that that when I was
04:26 a kid in my teens
04:29 which was the 80s
04:31 really it's 13 to 18 right that's you
04:34 really got like five years where you're
04:35 a teenager the will didn't suck so bad
04:38 and we didn't need to be so awake now
04:40 horrible things were occurring
04:41 underneath the fabric of society right
04:46 those in charge been doing horrible
04:48 things for ever for a very very long
04:49 time probably since recorded history the
04:54 Catholic Church has been hiding its
04:56 deeds for centuries if not millennia I
04:59 didn't even have to hide it at millenia
05:01 ago just happened and it was like screw
05:03 you we do this to kids and you can't do
05:05 anything about it but overall the 80s
05:08 were fantastic positive goofy but
05:12 positive there's a video out there
05:13 called video of a world that no longer
05:17 exists and it's a kid filming a
05:19 convenience store 911 911 a 7-eleven
05:23 I believe Tampa Florida he's just
05:26 goofing off with a camera running around
05:27 interviewing people and everyone coming
05:29 in and out both Cuban and American and
05:32 everything else coming in there and
05:33 having fun people smoking in the
05:35 7-eleven was really funny that the
05:36 managers smoking but the world didn't
05:39 suck so bad back then we didn't walk
05:43 around with a few years and the worries
05:45 that we have today we didn't have false
05:47 flags about every two months being
05:49 pulled off by some deep state
05:53 organization with a bunch of crisis
05:56 actors because they can't they couldn't
05:59 make it in Hollywood so they're gonna
06:00 make it wherever they can and their
06:02 price is very low we didn't have
06:05 craigslist posts to participate in crime
06:08 for a political party oh we had kids on
06:13 milk cartons and those kids on milk
06:15 cartons were being captured by probably
06:18 the same kind of people I'm gonna guess
06:20 probably fewer people than do it today
06:22 because once they figured out the system
06:24 once they figured out how to protect
06:25 themselves well they just Ratchet it up
06:26 and made a bigger group a bigger party
06:29 hey there's more people doing it than
06:31 unless less of a chance that they
06:34 personally would get caught because some
06:35 other guy next him will get caught
06:36 always someone to finger down below
06:39 right
06:40 an opponent if you're one of the early
06:43 people to wake up I'm gonna say 2003
06:46 some of you saw 911 on the day it
06:48 happened you were like this isn't right
06:51 all walks of life saw it and didn't
06:55 believe it they didn't know what
06:57 happened but they reported to me you
06:59 know and I saw that I thought it was
07:00 [ __ ] and I always tell them I said
07:03 man you're ahead of me you're amazing
07:05 you have a good mind you think for
07:07 yourself I'm envious that you were awake
07:10 that early the most exciting thing I've
07:13 seen the last 48 hours is pictures from
07:16 a Trump rally
07:18 again you don't have to like Trump they
07:20 totally get this statement okay you
07:21 don't need to run off and pound the
07:24 subscribe button
07:26 but young kids I'm gonna guess 10
07:30 through 18 showing up at rallies with
07:35 cue shirts on q and on shirts on we're
07:39 gonna dive deep into Q and what he
07:41 symbolizes because it's important it's
07:46 real important and those who try to
07:49 criticize him into a LARP well all I can
07:53 say is sure smells like fear doesn't it
07:57 anybody who says that LARP [ __ ] is
08:00 someone who is smelling fear or someone
08:03 trying to create clickbait on YouTube it
08:07 doesn't matter if Q and on is a LARP or
08:10 not oh let's play a game let's play a
08:13 game called Q and on let's just go with
08:15 that [ __ ] notion real quickly here
08:17 let's play the game of queuing on
08:19 everybody well what's that game well
08:21 it's a LARP
08:22 what's a LARP it's a live-action
08:23 role-playing exercise okay that sounds
08:25 cool you know there's people that pay a
08:26 lot of money to go eat dinner and solve
08:28 a mystery in some mansion same [ __ ]
08:31 except what are we gonna use we're gonna
08:34 use facts we're gonna use real
08:36 information in the world to design this
08:38 live-action role-playing exercise oh
08:40 that's cool
08:41 yeah you're gonna learn a fuckload of
08:43 information about how the world is
08:44 [ __ ] and then we're going to
08:47 live-action roleplay all the solutions
08:50 to the problem you know don't pay any
08:54 attention
08:54 the fact he's embedded with Trump and
08:55 then he always post stuff that Trump's
08:57 either says or does or worse Trump is
08:59 all these absolutely intangible
09:03 photographs and tangible evidence prior
09:06 to it being publicly handed out to the
09:10 people
09:10 let's overlook all that proof right no
09:14 yeah it's totally alarm all right the
09:18 only way you think a LARP is bad is if
09:20 you think that the world is a wonderful
09:23 place that pedophiles who are being
09:26 caught having been a part of Hillary
09:29 Clinton's campaign are just it's just
09:31 great news right you turn on Netflix and
09:33 you watch two kids jerk off together her
09:36 minors and you think that's art well we
09:40 got pedophiles running around Jeffery
09:43 Epstein's right so what are we doing
09:45 we're playing a game here where everyone
09:47 practices and pretends to be awake to
09:51 all the real issues in the world all of
09:54 the farces all the people who lie in the
09:57 alphabet soup organizations you now know
10:00 their names you know their positions you
10:03 know their histories you've dug into
10:05 their Twitter accounts their Instagram
10:07 accounts their friends Instagram
10:08 accounts you figured out why people kill
10:11 themselves randomly because they have a
10:14 little scarred brand underneath their
10:17 belt line belong to a little sex cult
10:20 hmm interesting
10:22 you find out Robert De Niro's one of
10:24 them things out with the spear cooking
10:26 lady oh well no wonder no wonder he
10:29 doesn't like the president oh but this
10:31 is all just a LARP on our end it's just
10:34 it's just pretend right but we're gonna
10:36 use nothing but pure facts to construct
10:39 our our game hmm
10:43 so let's say it was a LARP I don't think
10:46 it is I think it's been proven quite the
10:48 opposite but what if it was everyone
10:51 playing awakens to how the world runs
10:56 everyone playing has the chance to ease
11:00 themselves into the truth of absolutely
11:02 horrific history and horrific realities
11:06 that
11:07 this to this day they're able to unplug
11:10 themselves from the TMZ celebrity
11:12 worship they're able to find scumbags
11:15 like Robert De Niro who was only
11:18 glorified rape and murder and gang
11:21 bangin and all his movies he has a
11:24 choice you know hmm but he chooses the
11:29 lesser path of humanity doesn't he hmm
11:32 oh sure he's made some cute movies me
11:38 one of my favorite movies awakening but
11:41 overall he needs to be the Frank Sinatra
11:46 2.0 right he needs to be the tough guy I
11:50 bet if you interviewed Frank on his
11:52 dying day and said you know it wasn't
11:54 really worth getting involved with all
11:55 this negative mafia [ __ ] I'm sure you'd
12:00 shake his head and go man I [ __ ] up I
12:02 should have stayed blue eyes I should
12:04 have stayed the crooner
12:05 I should have observed from the outside
12:09 because if I thought it was restrictive
12:11 to be famous in society once I joined
12:14 the Mafia it was even ten times more
12:17 restrictive to operate in society to
12:19 operate in business I had to do things I
12:22 didn't want to do hmm but some people
12:25 like De Niro loved it makes him feel
12:27 important you don't have to get a brain
12:29 you just gotta join a club get a slice
12:32 the back your middle finger right mr. De
12:34 Niro the Great Awakening is awesome to
12:39 be a teenager and be awake with the cue
12:41 shirt on at a presidential rally and
12:44 actually know what that means that I'm
12:45 assuming those kids do know what it
12:47 means and I'm overlooking the fact that
12:49 there are guys from 18 to 70 with the
12:52 same shirt on the world's waking up the
12:57 stuff is penetrating overseas is
12:59 penetrating our Canadian brothers
13:02 it's everywhere everybody wants the
13:06 answers to all the questions that they
13:09 thought would never be answered
13:14 I'm not sure anything's better than that
13:16 do you why were we asleep it may be a
13:20 really valuable question to ask I think
13:24 the reason why we were asleep because
13:27 things were great when does anyone
13:30 question government well when shits
13:32 going wrong why were there all these
13:34 hippie protests during Vietnam well
13:37 because a bunch of people were dropping
13:38 acid they were seeing love and seeing
13:41 God and they couldn't understand why
13:43 someone would want to murder someone
13:45 else I mean when you're high on acid and
13:48 especially you understand the full
13:50 impact of death you don't fear it but
13:53 you at least can monetize it in your
13:55 mind the value of life is right in front
13:57 of your face there's lunch and I had a
13:59 bad trip can you imagine taking that
14:01 [ __ ] you know but anyway but then
14:03 Vietnam was over life got good movies
14:07 got good TV got good music got good good
14:11 being an understatement and so we didn't
14:13 notice the economy was pretty good yeah
14:16 a couple markets went up and down but
14:18 the economy overall was pretty damn good
14:20 so we didn't notice and so the ease is
14:25 right into the 90s they took away
14:28 everything with virtue everything with
14:29 an uptick everything that taught us some
14:32 moral at the end of the story of how to
14:34 behave was erased music got dark it got
14:40 really dark let me just think about it
14:42 we had a style of music called grunge
14:47 really know what I'm about to say isn't
14:50 what I'm isn't a critique of the music
14:52 but it's just as bad as saying we have a
14:53 style of music that we call [ __ ] pain
14:59 suffering as a grunge means right it's a
15:06 gritty grungy way to live it's like
15:08 living in a ditch or living in a prison
15:11 of your own creation this country of the
15:15 United States of America I can't speak
15:16 for any other country I dearly hope this
15:18 is not true for other countries but I
15:20 think it is the darkness that was
15:23 hatched in the 90s steel plagues this
15:25 country today
15:27 right all the sort of I guess urban
15:32 cities I don't mean urban in the case of
15:35 a particular racial specification I mean
15:37 you got Los Angeles San Francisco New
15:40 York they've been through the the Hell's
15:43 Kitchen they've realized the [ __ ]
15:46 about gangbang and all that kind of
15:47 stuff but now you got all the Midwest
15:49 big cities like Dallas and Austin and
15:51 Houston Chicago kill kill kill right
15:59 worshiping old things that were invented
16:03 and some of us invent in the eighties
16:04 and some of the archetypes obviously go
16:06 back hundreds of years but it was
16:07 popularized in music in the 90s so
16:11 everything spun out of control why am i
16:13 picking on the night east because it has
16:14 a big part to do with waking up but no
16:19 matter how dark they made the 90s and
16:21 believe me it got pretty bad Emily you
16:24 know there was a Rage Against the
16:25 Machine trying to wake everybody up
16:27 there was a lot of rappers trying to
16:28 wake everyone up
16:30 not much grunge was trying to do
16:32 anything profound some good music and
16:35 all those genres for sure 9/11 comes by
16:37 and it's like an 11 right if if all the
16:42 darkness of the 90s was maybe a three
16:45 9/11 is like 11 right it's huge
16:48 it blows everyone's mind to pieces two
16:53 and a half years later war starts in the
16:56 Middle East and it's still going to this
16:58 day 2003 to 2018 it's a 15-year war
17:03 seven trillion dollars in debt and all
17:05 we've done is create enemies all over
17:07 the world suffering destroyed countries
17:11 and cities and streets and hospitals and
17:15 everything that that generates a quality
17:18 of life has been destroyed how much
17:20 further can that go right how many more
17:24 things are there to bomb how many
17:25 buildings still exists the Middle East
17:27 that haven't already been bombed one
17:29 time it can't go on forever
17:32 and it's run its course so we needed to
17:36 change and America chose change
17:39 but now what's interesting about the
17:41 Great Awakening one doesn't need to
17:44 awake it to things that are on the
17:45 surface do we because we look around and
17:47 we see the surface of everything it's
17:49 the book cover that we understand at
17:52 least we think we do the Great Awakening
17:54 is about the subdermal wake up what's
17:58 going on underneath the surface why is
18:01 this [ __ ] going on at all I don't want
18:04 to be in the Middle East bombing the
18:06 [ __ ] out of a bunch of country so I
18:07 don't want to hate everyone who's Arab I
18:09 don't want to hate anyone of any race so
18:12 how did we get here in the first place
18:14 how do I have this perception in my head
18:16 that America as a country endorses this
18:20 [ __ ] part of the Great Awakening was
18:23 figuring out that in 2004 reuters bought
18:27 Associated Press a bunch of corporations
18:30 about a bunch of different corporations
18:31 Disney but what is it
18:34 ABC okay consolidation of the yellow
18:40 journalism that's out there hmm
18:43 so now we only have four corporations
18:45 that own all the person in the world
18:47 anything goes international and any
18:49 press circuit in America it's always
18:51 credited to either ap or Reuters same
18:54 [ __ ] place who bought Reuters in the
18:58 1800's the Rothschilds hmm then maybe
19:03 they're real maybe they're Kaiser so say
19:04 who knows what they represent the
19:07 capstone of the pyramid that was put on
19:10 our money did you put that on your money
19:12 I didn't put that on my money in America
19:14 that just happened and if you grew up
19:17 with that [ __ ] on your money you tend to
19:18 think that's the way it always was well
19:20 [ __ ] that's just the way the dollar bill
19:21 was made well no no go go look at all
19:23 the money before 1900 my [ __ ] wasn't on
19:26 our money
19:26 these [ __ ] and Phil infiltrated
19:29 our country and put their [ __ ]
19:30 Masonic stuff on our [ __ ] money they
19:33 howl in the corner they built the whole
19:37 city of Washington DC on pentagrams and
19:42 pyramids and owls if you haven't already
19:45 checked it out go look at the Capitol
19:46 building it's in the belly of a now the
19:49 advisor to Queen Semiramis a statue of
19:52 [ __ ] Liberty
19:53 her husband's phallus his [ __ ] piece is
19:57 the obelisk that is the National
20:00 Monument hopefully at some point we'll
20:04 think about why we still keep these
20:07 symbols around if Satan built a gigantic
20:11 bunny rabbit in your country and said oh
20:15 this is your hero this bunny rabbit
20:17 represents all the moral qualities of
20:20 your country and your people and we're
20:21 gonna put this fake message on the bunny
20:23 rabbit and then you wake up you wake up
20:28 at some point and realize that the bunny
20:30 rabbit was actually the agent of sing
20:34 right I don't really mean that in a
20:36 religious sentence but everything that's
20:38 evil on this planet is the bunny rabbit
20:40 are you gonna keep it around are you
20:43 gonna let it sit there because you've
20:44 built up a lot of sentimentality
20:45 because I walk down the street and
20:47 Ghostbusters no you need to tear it down
20:52 that's gonna be the last stage Georgia
20:55 Guidestones
20:56 blue suffer all the [ __ ] goes alright I
20:59 don't give a [ __ ] what you think about
21:01 history you're wrong I'm not talking to
21:03 you guys I'm talking to everyone else
21:05 who is going to be shocked by hopefully
21:08 what ends up occurring at the end of
21:09 this movie that we're now watching
21:13 what's crazy about the Great Awakening
21:14 for me is that there is a you well I
21:20 should say this way one amass is a
21:21 gigantic pile of information I'm not
21:25 gonna say truth but information that you
21:27 have to evaluate over and over and over
21:31 again and sometimes you get the full
21:33 story right you get the soup to nuts
21:35 story about how something occurs who a
21:37 particular person was you know what the
21:39 invested and I only touch kids or
21:41 whatever and you just know Jeffrey
21:43 Epstein is that guy no questions asked
21:46 alright but sometimes you only get a
21:49 little tiny piece of the information a
21:52 little tiny piece of the information and
21:55 then you're kind of like well that I can
21:57 see how that fits in with all the other
21:58 stuff that seems to be true but I don't
22:01 have enough information so I'm gonna
22:03 keep it to myself
22:05 what the Great Awakening has done
22:07 has offer mountains and mountains and
22:11 almost literally mountains of
22:13 information direct links to the proof of
22:17 things and the cross-referenced material
22:20 coming from opposing forces there's
22:22 nothing better than validating the truth
22:24 through opposing forces one group is
22:26 supposed to be against the other group I
22:28 mean they really are they're really
22:29 trying to assassinate this side of the
22:31 group and that one's trying to get rid
22:32 of this one but they end up slipping one
22:35 groups trying to bring out the truth the
22:37 other one is trying to deny it but
22:38 eventually something slips out and
22:41 validates the whole game now it's never
22:45 that simple it's never just two sources
22:47 it's usually a dozen or three dozen
22:49 sources photographic proof is usually
22:53 pretty damn good right not only a series
22:56 of a president hanging out with a little
22:57 kid with a sliced finger on his you know
23:00 middle finger with the bandaid on it but
23:02 five other photographs of him hanging
23:03 out with the same little girl over time
23:05 find her mother hanging out with some
23:07 pedophiles mm-hmm who's then hanging out
23:10 with some other pedophiles who's hanging
23:11 out with some Spirit cooking people who
23:14 knew all the people hanging themselves
23:15 with belts right the fear I've always
23:19 had is that all this information would
23:20 become available but there wouldn't be
23:22 in a movement by which the public would
23:24 ever see it see it at all or or have a
23:27 chance to jump in and put their own two
23:29 cents in but now we have q anon and
23:33 again that matter if he's a LARP or not
23:36 you know the Greek theater I mentioned
23:39 this every once in a while back in the
23:42 days of corrupt Greece right Greece is a
23:45 very interesting country in the history
23:47 of mankind because it entertained
23:50 virtually every form of conceivable
23:52 government that could ever have been
23:53 they tried them out they got rid of one
23:56 system of government put another one
23:58 just kept doing this and doing this and
24:00 doing this until they had a chance to
24:02 analyze things but often the reason why
24:05 a particular form of government would
24:07 fall was because of the Greek theater
24:09 playwrights playwrights would write a
24:12 play and they would enact in topology
24:17 symbolic form the leaders of the Greek
24:22 they would enact a bunch of policies
24:25 going bad the people suffering and the
24:27 people watching the plane would go oh I
24:29 get it
24:30 this is a metaphor for our shitty
24:32 government and then they would go up
24:34 there and get everyone off their
24:36 pedestals kill him incarcerated but at
24:41 minimum changed their government and
24:43 eventually the government caught on to
24:45 this problem in the government would
24:48 just kill the playwright kill an actor
24:51 and this went on and on until the actors
24:54 were so afraid the playwrights were so
24:57 afraid to write the truth that they
24:59 simply wrote [ __ ] they found
25:02 archetypes that the rich people and the
25:04 powerful people would accept and they
25:06 just ran him over and over and over
25:08 again until nothing of any value really
25:11 came out of it you want to call queuing
25:13 on a LARP fine I'm gonna say he's one of
25:18 the greatest Greek playwrights of the
25:21 modern 21st century if it's all fake
25:25 well then he's teaching you the
25:27 archetypes of how the world works
25:28 teaching you who does what who's
25:31 responsible for one helping you sniff
25:34 the [ __ ] down from the President of
25:38 the United States and how he operates
25:39 all the way down to musicians and actors
25:45 who are involved with all this sick [ __ ]
25:49 it's powerful and it's valuable and it's
25:51 rare it's rare in history that this ever
25:54 occurs now if you kids are too young and
25:59 I'm saying my age 48 you got to be older
26:03 than me to really know this off the top
26:05 of your the tip of your tongue I should
26:07 say right the top of your head when
26:10 Nixon was framed for Watergate did
26:15 wanted to get rid of the guy I'm not
26:17 saying the guy was innocent of anything
26:19 I'm just thinking I just I've heard
26:22 enough about the eyewitness accounts of
26:25 the children one of the sons of one of
26:27 the guys that helped pull off Watergate
26:29 he's father came home brought a suitcase
26:31 oh I'm a Samsonite suitcase or bought
26:33 all the [ __ ] home
26:34 Samsonite suitcase put all the crap in
26:36 the suitcase with a bunch of heavy [ __ ]
26:38 poked holes and they drove it out to a
26:40 bridge and threw it off a bridge okay
26:42 the only way that we knew what happened
26:45 in Watergate was that someone was
26:46 leaking [ __ ] to the press and that
26:48 someone had a codename of deep throat
26:51 yeah it's a provocative name I don't
26:54 understand that at all I never have
26:56 understood that perhaps some creepy
27:00 perverted thing that they also want to
27:02 throw out there at the same time but
27:05 this was the guy we gave the press all
27:08 the information to get Watergate to the
27:10 point it was a scandal to get Nixon out
27:12 office okay now we have the opposite
27:17 polarity with Cuba non we have someone
27:20 who is letting us know what's happening
27:24 on the inside because there's a lot of
27:28 there's a massive differential between
27:31 what the public knows on average and
27:33 what's going on underneath the scenes
27:36 behind the scenes and if there isn't a
27:40 large group of people that understand
27:42 what's about to be debuted what's about
27:44 to come out let's just hope it all
27:46 happens the way that we have been told
27:49 then the world could simply reject it
27:51 not a mere cowardice but if there's ten
27:55 million people who've been following q
27:57 and telling their friends even if a lot
28:00 of people like well I'm still reluctant
28:02 to do believe this I have a very very
28:05 close friend of mine who says look I
28:07 hope what you're saying is true but
28:09 right now I think it's a LARP is that
28:11 fine
28:12 and I told him what I told you guys it's
28:14 the best thing that's ever happened
28:15 because it's educational it's it's let's
28:20 back up for those of you who are new to
28:22 Cuba non he has something he calls the
28:25 autists now autistic is a medical
28:29 designation in 2018 to cover up for the
28:32 fact that vaccinations fry the brains of
28:34 children they try to blame it on your
28:36 genetics it has nothing to do with
28:37 autism autism is Rain Man Dustin Hoffman
28:40 a kid with a massive consciousness
28:45 perhaps two or three as I mentioned
28:47 several times on several
28:48 shows at a very close friend of mine
28:50 with three consciousnesses running at
28:51 the same time three massive processors
28:54 and I mean massive processors autists
28:58 are people that can see more
29:00 they simply are massively analytical
29:03 he's not referencing people with autism
29:05 hey maybe there is person with autism a
29:08 real autism and they would be deadly and
29:12 deciphering the facts and
29:13 cross-referencing things because they
29:14 typically have photographic memories and
29:16 whatever they focus on they crunch
29:19 better than a supercomputer but for
29:21 everyone else is just a normal person
29:23 spectating the outcome of these autists
29:26 these researchers who are phenomenal and
29:28 maybe some of the autists are actually
29:30 part of the QED team simply just feeding
29:31 the facts out there because no one's
29:33 getting in the head doesn't matter we're
29:35 getting to see critical thought in
29:37 process and we're learning and upgrading
29:39 our own critical thought there's nothing
29:42 better and more empowering for a human
29:43 mind for a human outcome for a human
29:47 destiny than critical thinking it helps
29:50 you get every goal you ever wanted in
29:52 life and that's what's happening if you
29:56 simply join the queue and on movement
29:58 your whole life is going to be better
30:01 regardless if you have anything to do
30:03 with the agendas within the queue and on
30:06 posts on hñ you will think better
30:10 someone who tries to screw you you look
30:12 right at them and go you're trying to
30:13 [ __ ] me I see it [ __ ] you man no way and
30:17 you either avoid it or you negotiate
30:20 combat it and become victorious it'll
30:25 make you a better student in high school
30:27 grade school college when you become a
30:31 worker bee when you want to start your
30:33 own business you will think things
30:35 through better and if you truly follow
30:38 this movement to the very end I
30:39 guarantee you the one quality you're
30:41 going to have which is usually a quality
30:44 that is intangible in the classroom is
30:48 something we call patience you're going
30:52 to see for those of you who are sitting
30:53 there going come on arrest these people
30:55 but handcuffs on these people child
30:57 children around the world are being
30:58 molested right now and every day that
31:00 you wait to put these people in here
31:02 cuffs one more kid gets screwed over
31:05 maybe maybe even dies horribly believe
31:09 me people in this movement totally get
31:13 it
31:13 but moving too soon means that one more
31:16 of these goddamn perverts one more of
31:19 these absolute deep state criminals gets
31:22 away and they get to incubate up the
31:25 virus again it is very important that
31:28 when you flood the body with an anti
31:30 antibody to get rid of an infection or
31:33 an antiviral or a protein blocker or
31:36 some sort to stop something from
31:37 happening in the human body it must be
31:40 absolute it must completely cure you
31:43 because if we just cure a little bit of
31:45 your cancer it'll go back and so the
31:49 attempt is being made at a desperate
31:51 level to capture all of the virus all of
31:55 the bacteria all the invaders in this
31:58 body that we call freedom on this planet
32:00 there's a lot of disenfranchised people
32:03 in the world for very good reasons some
32:06 of them are unfortunately supporting
32:08 their captors they're supporting those
32:10 who are the ones that will go to jail
32:14 that probably several that'll end up on
32:16 the end of a belt probably actually by
32:20 their own hand but they're
32:23 disenfranchised because they've been
32:25 screwed over by the system
32:26 some people have silver spoons up their
32:29 asses they've never had to work a day in
32:32 their life and so they're capable of
32:34 showing up at protests all the time they
32:36 never know the issues but they have the
32:38 time to hang out and why do they do it
32:40 because they want to have a purpose in
32:42 life don't they what's purpose it's love
32:45 of its purpose well I can't think of a
32:50 better purpose than contributing to the
32:54 Kuban on movement vetting everything are
32:59 they perfect hell no are they getting
33:01 their way all the time and the qnr
33:02 movement meaning queue and his people
33:05 hell no but if you've ever watched your
33:09 favorite you know cop worshipping show
33:13 on TV with a bunch of mysteries and
33:14 Polaroids
33:16 on a big board at a homicide
33:19 you know office in a police precinct and
33:22 these guys are trying to crack it right
33:24 and you're just riveted for an hour or
33:25 two hours or three hours watching this
33:27 or maybe a whole season well they're
33:29 trying to find who did it and who done
33:31 it then you'll understand what's going
33:33 on but let me just get you clear on
33:38 something here of any show you've ever
33:41 seen Anna fictional environment with X
33:44 number of Polaroids on the wall the
33:46 amount of Polaroids on the wall on the
33:48 queue and on movement this get rid of
33:52 all the scumbags movement that's going
33:54 on right now it would probably take the
33:57 side of the World Trade Center at 110
33:59 stories simply to store tiny Polaroids
34:01 this big to finger everyone who's
34:04 involved so it's a big job it's a big
34:08 job and if it happens in two years or
34:10 three years let me tell you that is the
34:12 fastest moment of absolute justice that
34:17 you will ever witness in world history
34:19 now do we have to be careful with what's
34:23 going on yes and no one ever talks about
34:26 this so we're gonna spend a few minutes
34:27 on this we do have to be careful once
34:32 this is over because there's going to be
34:36 a tremendous amount of heroes real ones
34:41 that are out there and it's gonna be a
34:43 two-fold caution one you need to
34:47 understand the deep seat will not be
34:49 completely eradicated from this planet
34:51 in my estimation I believe there's
34:55 scumbag families and scumbag rich people
34:57 that have already hidden themselves
34:59 they've hidden their money they've raced
35:01 their past and they're hiding but they
35:05 are infected with all the shitty viruses
35:07 that made them the [ __ ] at they are
35:09 maybe they curl up and die in a cave if
35:12 we're lucky but I'm sure they spawn or
35:16 sure they've taken another you know
35:19 unknown college student who has no past
35:24 right we don't know who the hell the guy
35:26 is his father isn't his father he hides
35:29 his records so he's born one place when
35:32 he's not he fakes his birth certificate
35:33 that's happening again there's a bunch
35:36 of people I know that are in the
35:38 pipeline right now to go next and
35:42 they're gonna have money soon as this
35:44 whole thing calms down well they're
35:46 gonna pretend to be part of the queue
35:47 and non-movement they're gonna pretend
35:49 to have been part of the awakening but
35:51 they're gonna be a wolf in sheep's
35:52 clothing and they're gonna try to
35:54 re-emerge and they're gonna definitely
35:57 infiltrate just as soon as the cancers
36:01 out these scumbags are gonna try to call
36:03 Brock crawl back in and hopefully we've
36:05 got things in place to stop him from
36:07 doing that but at the same exact time we
36:08 come to our second level of caution if
36:11 we managed to completely succeed
36:13 eradicating these individuals out of our
36:15 planet at least to some degree that it
36:19 will take them centuries to reconstitute
36:21 we have to be careful not to lose all of
36:26 our freedoms in the process by saying
36:29 well surveillance was the way that we
36:31 got all these people you see folks
36:34 surveillance is necessary he's dropping
36:36 is necessary the state being involved in
36:38 everything that you do is necessary
36:40 because it's the only way to catch these
36:41 scumbags
36:43 the sad part is there's truth to both
36:45 sides of the game right it is true
36:48 that's how we caught him do we really
36:50 want to state up our ass no because it
36:53 is constantly resulted in the loss of
36:58 freedom for us as a people
37:00 lyonell nation said something very
37:02 profound and one of his episodes
37:04 recently this is the end of June 2018 he
37:10 said that we have to be careful in fact
37:12 I think it might have been even the guy
37:13 from Infowars
37:14 with the beard the real news guy
37:17 apologize for not remembering his name
37:19 they say we have to be careful with the
37:21 fact that many issues that are
37:23 frustrating us at a state level most of
37:26 us feel like should be resolved at a
37:27 federal level now there's some issues
37:30 that I think should be resolved at a
37:31 federal level
37:32 gun rights should be absolutely resolved
37:35 at a federal level
37:36 remember state can't override federal
37:38 law all right I think legalizing
37:42 marijuana
37:42 hey if you're gonna do it do it if
37:44 you're not gonna do it don't do it but
37:46 don't have a bunch of states that are
37:47 off and on that's a super pain in the
37:50 ass right it treats a lot of people in
37:53 jail for the states that don't do it for
37:55 ridiculous petty [ __ ] okay you know
37:59 I've told you on the show I think you
38:01 only should smoke pot if your whole life
38:03 is absolutely perfect and it's pretty
38:05 much on autopilot because it will make
38:07 you tired it'll make you lazy and it
38:09 will erode your brain's quickness it
38:12 just does I've done it several times and
38:14 I've watched it destroy me and then I
38:16 just literally said you know what I
38:17 don't like sleeping in late I don't like
38:20 losing my sharpness I don't like having
38:24 my photographic memory turn into the Sun
38:27 blurry
38:27 sludge in my head but again let's just
38:31 say these are the mechanisms by which we
38:32 freed ourselves giving up some of our
38:35 freedoms so we could catch the bad guys
38:37 all right
38:38 perhaps we could build on artificial
38:40 intelligence and perhaps it's already
38:42 built such that anything transferred
38:44 over the Internet is caught by a
38:46 supercomputer analyzed for what it
38:50 really is
38:52 audio could sense children in distress
38:55 children in certain states of pleasure
39:00 that aren't usually accessible to a
39:03 child it can bubble it up to human being
39:06 to take a look at it any human being
39:08 goes numb that's just kids playing gig
39:10 crying cuz they're tired or they didn't
39:14 get the toy they wanted for Christmas
39:15 that's what that video is but we're
39:17 going to have to do something after
39:20 we're victorious to maintain it I
39:25 guarantee you what we don't do is create
39:27 shows on Netflix that try to erode our
39:31 moral standards or we protect kids okay
39:36 we don't fictionally portray them doing
39:40 things that even they might do in real
39:41 life we all know kids jerk off when
39:43 they're young we do but we don't need to
39:45 put that on television
39:47 let that be a little private thing kids
39:50 do we don't need shows like Rome from
39:53 HBO
39:54 that when a guy goes in to buy a
39:56 prostitute for his buddy a young boy is
40:00 brought out in line with all the girls
40:02 we don't need that [ __ ] we don't need a
40:05 story arc where the cook in Rome thinks
40:08 that Caesar is having sex with his
40:10 nephew when he's really just having some
40:13 sort of forgot what his illness was he
40:15 was having some attacks or something in
40:17 his body but they thought it was funny
40:20 to have the chef to cook this female
40:23 think that Caesar was having sex with
40:25 his nephew straight-up pedophilia
40:28 straight-up [ __ ] pedophilia you can
40:31 go by that today at your local video
40:33 store you can go and watch it on HBO
40:38 there's none of that [ __ ] in Deadwood
40:40 there's none of that [ __ ] in Carnivale
40:42 to other HBO projects there's none of
40:45 this stuff I don't believe in Westworld
40:47 right so there's still quality
40:50 entertainment there but we don't need
40:51 those things to be put out there we just
40:54 don't maybe they just edit that scene
40:57 out once we reset what we're willing to
41:02 tolerate if Hugh and on is real then if
41:07 it doesn't matter if he's real or not he
41:09 may not succeed but if they're able to
41:11 succeed at what they're doing and you're
41:16 alive when it happens then you will have
41:19 witnessed one of the greatest moments in
41:21 human history I'm actually not sure when
41:25 this has ever happened in the past some
41:28 people cite the French Revolution as one
41:31 of those moments where the people rose
41:32 up and got rid of their monarchies cut
41:34 their heads off with the guillotine
41:37 we know it's happened several times in
41:39 history we just don't have it on [ __ ]
41:41 HD video do we that's what's happening
41:44 right now we have the Holocaust taught
41:48 in so many schools there's museums
41:50 there's a schvitz that you can go visit
41:52 and the reason why these things exist is
41:55 that they are trying to make sure it
41:56 never happens again okay well then I
42:02 guess we need to build a bunch of
42:03 museums to this problem too but then how
42:06 can we we can't even admit
42:08 with the President of the United States
42:09 and the nineties did or after he was in
42:12 office we're gonna build a little Lolita
42:15 Island and say oh this is where a bunch
42:17 of kids were raped it killed we can't do
42:20 that can we
42:21 it's too horrific we don't really want
42:25 our kids to know that this stuff ever
42:27 occurs because we don't want them to
42:28 grow up in the shadow of the fears that
42:31 we as adults and the dulls before us
42:34 have allowed to happen on our watch I'm
42:37 just proud as hell that this is coming
42:40 to an end on our watch all of our
42:42 watches right
42:43 anyone who's donning a cue and on
42:45 t-shirt I'm looking at girls that must
42:48 be like 14 15 years old and some of
42:51 these photographs wearing not only a cue
42:53 and on shirt but acute one on hats
42:55 sitting next to her brothers probably 12
42:57 13 years old okay I'm willing to bet
43:00 they know the truth I'm willing to bet
43:03 they know the truth that horrible things
43:05 happen to people how many times have we
43:08 had a movement that was complete
43:10 [ __ ] the whole world got behind the
43:13 kony2012 horseshit
43:14 the end of the world 2012 horse [ __ ]
43:17 [ __ ] Mayan calendar being all
43:20 upside-down and red you know no one paid
43:22 attention to the people who were Mayan
43:24 who read the calendar and said you know
43:25 what the numbers that you're citing are
43:27 complete horseshit
43:28 you've misconstrued every single numeric
43:30 indicator in this calendar
43:32 it's actually in the four thousands but
43:35 because you want to sell a bunch of
43:36 books and create a bunch of hysteria you
43:40 pushed it to 2012 the Kony guy ends up
43:45 down there in San Diego naked roaming
43:48 around screaming to himself because they
43:50 got to him they did a whole MKULTRA
43:52 project on the guy now he's totally
43:54 discredited they just flushed his ass
43:56 down the drain I know a guy who lost his
44:00 girlfriend because of the Kony 2012
44:01 thing because and I was just her friend
44:04 but we all told her she was full of [ __ ]
44:06 she needs to relax she didn't pay
44:07 attention to any to facts what was going
44:09 on in Africa it was all [ __ ] you
44:13 were supposed to fear Ebola breaking out
44:14 all over the world
44:17 several times several times tons of this
44:21 [ __ ] constantly plugging the mind of men
44:25 so know what else is important to
44:29 understand about this Great Awakening
44:31 well I'm willing to bet that we haven't
44:34 seen the last card played by the deep
44:36 state
44:37 not even close not even close now there
44:42 are people dying right now
44:44 soldiers who are dying right now around
44:46 the world engaging in maneuvers that we
44:49 are not privy to well they're being
44:52 reported as training accidents it's
44:54 [ __ ] Hughes told us that you know
44:58 there's pretty decent evidence that a
45:00 missile was launched when Trump was
45:01 trying to fly over to Singapore to meet
45:04 with Kim Jong hoon I mean it was taken
45:07 by a Weather Channel camera Navy's like
45:09 it wasn't us
45:10 someone fired a missile into the sky at
45:13 the same time the president United
45:14 States was flying over the Pacific q
45:18 keeps telling us they're not playing
45:19 games but that's I think one thing that
45:21 doesn't come through on a chain board
45:24 this is real and they're playing for
45:27 keeps
45:27 I think we have to absolutely positively
45:32 expect a true assassination attempt on
45:35 the president of United States this year
45:38 and 2018 I think we have to expect that
45:41 that's going to take place I do I think
45:43 he has a security force around him a
45:44 security detail yeah I do
45:47 that they are hopefully on board with
45:50 him but they've been informed of all of
45:52 the horrible things that they are
45:53 actually standing for so they understand
45:57 to their [ __ ] core of their soul the
46:00 job that they are doing and keeping this
46:02 movement moving forward there was
46:04 mention of a sky event and supposedly
46:06 there was a post from Q that said that
46:08 was avoided who knows what the hell he's
46:11 talking about who knows what he's
46:13 talking about I definitely can tell you
46:16 beyond the shadow of a doubt that
46:17 there's a bunch of equipment in space
46:20 that was at least up until this last
46:23 election controlled by forces that don't
46:25 wish you any well-being
46:28 and these are weapons that can attack
46:31 the ground hopefully they have been
46:34 reappropriation Rican trolled by good
46:39 people
46:40 hopefully it's a big big job can they
46:45 stop every rocket in the world going out
46:47 masked as some sort of like um benign
46:50 satellite probably not probably say hell
46:53 it's a communication Sally being
46:54 launched in Africa somewhere on behalf
46:56 of three different space organizations
46:58 oh it's just a lowly you know satellite
47:02 for this set and the other thing but
47:03 it's actually got something on it that's
47:05 bad you gotta be careful for those of
47:09 you haven't seen my show ever before you
47:10 need to understand I am the last person
47:12 on earth to create a scare tactic I
47:17 don't want you to be concerned at all
47:19 about most things in life but these are
47:20 just things we have to keep in mind
47:22 because what's beautiful about the cue
47:26 and on movement I forget what the movie
47:30 is but there's there's several different
47:32 films and stories on television that
47:34 have done this but they they have a
47:36 person that is you know trying to bring
47:40 justice to the world either they are
47:43 exposed or they are disabled in whatever
47:47 way shape or form but all that happens
47:49 is is that everyone else's I'm cueing on
47:52 and then the next person says I'm cueing
47:55 on and then you got 10 million people
47:57 saying I'm cueing on and this shit's
47:59 never gonna end this [ __ ] is never gonna
48:01 end
48:02 not this particular juncture there's a
48:05 lot of efforts to create a civil war in
48:07 the United States of America we have
48:10 politicians scumbags like Maxine Waters
48:13 telling everyone to basically incite
48:15 riot and terrorist activity in this
48:17 country and right away it started
48:19 happening right away okay now there was
48:23 a there was some news a conservative
48:26 newspaper that was shot up today that
48:29 was a disgruntled employee you know so
48:31 savior savior juices for something else
48:35 that wasn't involved with this whole
48:36 thing but what kind of
48:40 what kind of political party would allow
48:44 someone to run around the country
48:45 inciting violence because that's exactly
48:49 unequivocally black and white what
48:52 Maxine Waters did when she opened her
48:54 big stupid [ __ ] mouth
48:56 she should be absolutely put in [ __ ]
49:00 jail taken have her senatorial seat
49:02 taken the [ __ ] away and have felony
49:06 charges of terrorism on her spend the
49:08 rest of your [ __ ] bald ass in jail
49:11 doesn't matter if she's a woman doesn't
49:13 matter what race she is I don't care if
49:16 it was a Republican white guy doing this
49:20 it's wrong it's morally irresponsible
49:22 and it's treason it's absolute treason
49:27 anyone who is harmed in any way shape or
49:30 form either verbally assaulted or
49:34 physically battery or perhaps even
49:37 killed as a result of those statements
49:40 all not only that person charged with
49:43 the crime but Maxine Waters should be
49:45 charged with that crime as well and
49:46 anyone who endorses her should get the
49:49 endorse get the crime as well because
49:51 you're aiding and abetting
49:53 that's not descent people that is not
49:56 descent descent is what we built this
50:00 country on the ability to express your
50:02 difference it's the First Amendment how
50:05 does the world work when it comes to how
50:08 we should make the world work what's
50:10 been the history of this world well
50:14 let's just go from a consumer product
50:17 level first and then we'll get to the
50:19 the way government's work if you ask
50:23 someone what a cellphone was in 1993
50:26 they would give you a very definitive
50:28 answer of what one looks like and the
50:30 features you can expect to have while
50:32 paying a thousand dollars for it right
50:34 guys carrying around a little suitcase
50:36 the phone on top then they were
50:39 miniaturized partially got the flip
50:42 phone the Motorola analog flip phone in
50:44 the mid-90s and that's what we thought
50:46 they were then they turned into what we
50:48 call the candy bar the digital phone
50:49 probably extremely lethal but it all
50:52 kind of evolved down
50:54 - what the BlackBerry was a smartphone
50:58 little physical keyboard at the bottom
51:00 little screen up the top and we had
51:02 different devices for navigating around
51:04 blackberry had that little ball that
51:06 always pop out other phones had you know
51:09 arrows that went in different directions
51:10 at one point there was like 650
51:13 different phones around the world I was
51:16 in the video game business and I watched
51:17 companies make tons of money because
51:21 they helped companies test against all
51:23 these different phones but then
51:25 something happen around two thousand six
51:28 seven right when Steve Jobs walked out
51:30 with the iPhone he completely with his
51:34 team of brilliant geniuses re-engineered
51:36 the smartphone from scratch threw away
51:38 the physical keyboard linked it to his
51:41 iTunes store allowed the world in so you
51:45 could be a little Schmo and make a
51:46 little flashlight app and walk away with
51:49 the million bucks and then the whole
51:52 world redefine what a phone was right
51:54 and the reason why I bring that up is
51:57 that we have leaders in this world
51:59 creative people who look at things
52:02 differently Steve Jobs was a God in this
52:06 room he looked at everything differently
52:08 people would have ideas and either he'd
52:10 say yeah exactly the way you said it
52:12 that's the way I want you to make it or
52:13 he said it's a pretty good idea but that
52:15 sucks over there and this is kind of
52:17 good here so let's do this do you change
52:19 it people don't have any idea how much
52:21 that guy participated in product
52:22 development until he died and the
52:26 company stagnated everyone's like oh
52:27 well maybe Steve actually did a lot more
52:29 than we thought he did yeah
52:30 [ __ ] he did but that's exactly
52:33 how governments work why do we have the
52:36 Constitution of the United States
52:38 because Europe created Magna Carta what
52:43 happened to Magna Carta the second it
52:44 was created they'll see my episode on it
52:46 i believe in season 1 as soon as they
52:49 made it they got the rights and then the
52:52 king rose the taxes and the people said
52:55 what the [ __ ] dude what's up with all
52:58 these taxes well it's not against your
52:59 Magna Carta I'm just raising taxes and
53:01 they said well we don't the taxes back
53:02 down he says ok well let me do you a
53:04 little um let's negotiate here I don't
53:07 like that
53:08 or magna carta I don't like the fact you
53:09 have those rights why don't you bring
53:11 down your rights and I'll bring down the
53:12 taxes at the same time and so they caved
53:14 and they caved and they caved
53:16 until that [ __ ] document was gone by
53:19 the time our forefathers came over here
53:22 and formed this country Europe had gone
53:25 back to the full-blown tyrannical
53:28 monarchy but it's starting to turn into
53:30 today under the EU right you can go to
53:34 jail in the UK for posting [ __ ] on the
53:38 internet that wouldn't wouldn't shake
53:40 wouldn't wouldn't cause an eyebrow to
53:42 raise in America it's going back people
53:47 what's going on America is the best
53:51 iPhone the world has ever seen
53:54 if we succeed over here it will provide
53:57 an archetype for all citizens of the
54:00 world to measure their world against
54:02 another world to say are we winning here
54:05 are we really winning here do we really
54:08 have any rights in this world where's
54:11 your buddy nah he's in jail why well he
54:13 posted something on Facebook or Twitter
54:15 or whatever the [ __ ] really what do you
54:18 say I disagree with the government did
54:21 he threaten anyone's life no not at all
54:23 he just exposed what's going on over
54:26 here so the rest of the world could see
54:27 it and over here we don't play that game
54:30 we put you in jail you must do what the
54:32 state says oh by the way our news it's
54:35 complete by the government it's great
54:38 what do they say is one of the most
54:41 important things in the universe answer
54:44 an idea an idea is the most resilient
54:49 thing in the universe because an idea
54:53 attaches to another absolutely resilient
54:57 thing in the universe and it's called
54:59 love and love is usually grouped in with
55:06 something called freedom every being
55:09 senses freedom why do we have jails
55:12 prisons around the world why do we have
55:15 those things
55:15 hmm well the notion is it detours
55:18 criminals from making a life out of
55:21 their crime
55:21 let's some people stay in there forever
55:24 because they've done something so bad
55:26 societies like mine I don't think you
55:27 can never be allowed back in but why is
55:30 that punishment why doesn't someone just
55:32 go to jail and go to prison and guy this
55:33 is awesome
55:34 I love the shitty food I love the smell
55:36 I love not having a pillow I love not
55:41 being able to go where I want to go and
55:43 talk to people I want to talk to I love
55:46 eating
55:46 you know metric tons of salt I'm gaining
55:49 a bunch of weight I love this it's
55:51 awesome they don't because it intrudes
55:55 on one of their most intrinsic
55:57 understood values to matter if their IQ
56:00 is 60 or 260 they understand the value
56:04 of freedom freedom goes in many
56:08 different ways right well the most basic
56:11 freedom to a prisoner is just being able
56:12 to live a life that's normal to go down
56:15 to the store because they want to to get
56:17 up when they want to to sleep in when
56:18 they want to to work where they want to
56:20 have the Destiny that they can apply
56:21 themselves to and get with the other
56:24 freedom that we overlook all the time is
56:26 your freedom not to be [ __ ] with
56:29 right to have children and say you know
56:33 what I bought a house I paid 750 grand
56:36 for this house and I got I don't know a
56:38 quarter acre in Southern California and
56:41 my kids should be able to play on the
56:43 front lawn without me worrying about
56:47 than being captured by an adult and sold
56:51 off to some goddamn senator I believe it
56:54 there was a woman in last 10 years he
56:55 was arrested and and had the Child
57:00 Protection Care come and I believe take
57:02 her kids for just a short bit and what
57:04 was her crime letting her kids play in
57:07 the front yard unattended by her now
57:10 some of you might go well that's yeah of
57:11 course you should attend your child when
57:13 they're out front
57:14 hey I don't necessarily disagree and
57:16 only because the ball can roll out in
57:17 front of the street and unless you teach
57:19 your kids over and over and over and
57:21 over and over again not to run out to
57:22 grab that ball they might do it they'll
57:24 just simply die creating a horrible
57:26 tragedy for someone driving their car
57:28 and obviously you're gonna injure your
57:30 child or perhaps lose them but you're
57:33 listening to a guy
57:35 who grew up with parents that just went
57:37 to work in the summertime I'd have a
57:40 babysitter at a babysitter at night why
57:42 I don't [ __ ] know but during the day
57:45 I could do whatever I wanted to and I
57:47 did and you know what I had plenty of
57:49 friends to play with
57:50 who didn't have their parents at home
57:52 either now some of my friends had
57:53 stay-at-home moms but it was only like
57:55 one in four had to stay at home stay at
57:57 home mom usually that was off and on and
58:01 I can tell you I managed to finish my
58:04 entire childhood in 70s and 80s without
58:06 a single friend of mine getting
58:07 kidnapped without being molested by some
58:12 stranger what world do you want to live
58:14 in people what world you want to live in
58:17 now what if we what if we created it
58:19 lark where we all pretended to be good
58:22 people where we all pretended to
58:24 actually we we practice what we already
58:26 are which is good people and then we sat
58:28 there and we role-played just like
58:30 corporations that roleplay before they
58:32 go into major multibillion-dollar
58:33 ventures or mergers they roleplay what
58:37 what factors could come into place
58:40 what risks are they not seeing and they
58:45 learn from the role-playing well at
58:48 worst
58:49 at worst q and on is that for us at best
58:53 he's real at best everything he said is
58:57 true which means a lot of people are
58:59 already in big [ __ ] trouble I think
59:03 it's important to spread the Qi on
59:04 message it's important to send the link
59:07 out so that people can see what he posts
59:10 it's also important you send out the
59:12 translation key I did this to several
59:16 friends of mine who were interested in I
59:18 said okay I'm gonna give you the link to
59:19 read the queuing on posts however one
59:22 you need to know what he's posted up to
59:24 this point well let you go back and read
59:26 it all of course but if you don't know
59:28 what are R stands for or clowns or bread
59:32 or all the other terms autists if you
59:35 don't know how to clink the sub link
59:36 click the sub link to see what the
59:38 anions are saying in response and you
59:41 know brace yourself is going to be porn
59:43 in there and a bunch of [ __ ] saying
59:44 stuff there's going to be the most
59:46 offensive racial stuff in there
59:48 offensive orientation things in there
59:51 but you know what those are the trolls
59:53 that are trying to take you off the
59:56 beaten path what else could they be
59:58 besides trolls are not participating in
60:00 the actual solution if you want to take
60:03 it one step further refer them to the
60:04 cue proofs so they can see very quickly
60:08 hey this happened this was predicted by
60:11 queueing on and then this happened in
60:12 real life over and over and over time
60:15 about the tip top at tippy top from the
60:18 Easter Day speech very important I think
60:21 it was posted in January 23rd and then
60:25 it happened on Easter day Easter Sunday
60:29 quite a bit of space there pretty
60:32 amazing weird-ass thing for the
60:34 president United States to be saying
60:35 back-to-back no one ever says [ __ ]
60:39 tip top and tippy table no one ever says
60:41 those two things together ever in
60:44 history right my friends and I used to
60:47 have this game we used to play in the
60:48 office where we would try to do
60:49 something that we thought no one had
60:50 ever done in the world history there was
60:53 a simple stupidest stuff but it was like
60:55 taking out a piece of scotch tape and
60:56 then folding it over on itself and
60:58 stapling it 20 times there that's
61:01 totally stupid impractical and
61:02 ridiculous I don't think anyone whole
61:04 world's ever done that before and we
61:06 just continue doing stupid [ __ ] and
61:07 saying tip top and tippy top probably
61:09 beats everything that we ever did the
61:13 other thing I want to make sure that you
61:14 understand and you can trade with your
61:18 friends and conversation is the
61:19 following what happens and when out of
61:22 five out of six organizations in the
61:23 United States of America are all against
61:26 the President and Cuban on and for the
61:31 New World Order and the deep state well
61:35 they can create the impression that the
61:38 overall masses of this country believe
61:42 that that there's a giant movement
61:44 against sovereignty and freedom and
61:46 justice but it's not the case it's not
61:51 the case let me give you any a really
61:55 weird example imagine you're watching an
61:58 episode of Star Trek or some space
62:00 program and Eve just
62:02 arrive to a new planet and you know all
62:05 those those shows have a big screen put
62:07 it on the main screen right and out of a
62:10 whole [ __ ] planet the spaceship zooms
62:13 down to one guy I don't know he's
62:17 murdering a dog in the backyard looks
62:20 like a pretty innocent animal it is
62:21 making horrendous noises like a dog
62:23 would and they look at that and you
62:26 can't see anything else on that planet's
62:28 surface just the magnifying glass on
62:29 that one guy doing that horrible thing
62:32 well there's a bunch of idiots on the
62:34 spaceship they might say this is a
62:36 horrible planet look at what's going on
62:38 no one's coming to the rescue of this
62:40 dog and this guy's killing it
62:43 maybe there's this it's China and it's
62:46 being eaten and it's look we're walking
62:48 by and there's no problem boiling the
62:50 cats alive and all this stuff because
62:51 it's got a different culture than every
62:52 other place on his planet
62:54 what could give you the impression that
62:56 that one thing that's except that that
62:58 one place of the world is the way the
62:59 rest of world works but I'm willing to
63:02 give the benefit of the doubt for anyone
63:03 who has the wherewithal and the
63:05 knowledge to build a spaceship to travel
63:07 around the world travel around the
63:08 universe excuse me they pull back that
63:12 view and take another I don't know
63:15 thousand samples geographically abstract
63:18 from that one place they go all over the
63:20 planet they wait for a full rotation
63:22 they check the upper hemisphere
63:23 continents the lower hemisphere
63:25 continents they figure how many
63:27 languages are spoken what's the most
63:29 intelligent person like on that planet
63:31 what's the dumbest person on that planet
63:32 are their tribes that haven't been
63:33 discovered do they have their own
63:35 spaceship so they're watching us can
63:37 they hear us that's what you and on is
63:42 pulling back to camera from this one
63:45 obsessed narrative and looking at the
63:48 entire planet going whoa we're seeing
63:51 the good and we have discovered by
63:54 analysis through surveillance the bad as
63:58 I understand this entire movement it
64:00 goes something like this and I don't
64:01 hear it articulated much so let me just
64:03 put this in your your quiver of
64:07 conversation it's very important it's a
64:10 very simple concept after 9/11 we got
64:14 military commissions
64:16 which validated breaking the fourth
64:18 amendment through ease dropping we got
64:20 the NSA going to level 11 on
64:22 surveillance the internet alone got all
64:25 the chatter between human beings
64:26 electron Oh sized right got turned into
64:30 tcp/ip packets may be UDP packets I'm
64:35 not sure then they started looking for
64:37 bad guys they really did they really did
64:41 look for bad guys and I'm willing to bet
64:43 that was probably a few hundred agents
64:45 that were jerking off to other people's
64:46 pictures and porn and people doing live
64:49 chants between husband and wife or
64:50 boyfriend and girlfriend or whatever and
64:52 they were enjoying it look at this man
64:54 we get to look at all this crazy stuff
64:55 it's amazing yeah it's great and all of
64:57 a sudden all of a sudden in the middle
64:59 of all that crazy law breaking [ __ ] the
65:03 PTO's came through the satanic [ __ ] came
65:07 through chatter came through that was
65:10 probably not symbolic they probably
65:13 weren't using pizza and hot dogs they're
65:15 probably talking about exactly what they
65:17 did
65:17 sending videotape evidence of what they
65:20 were doing
65:20 hard drives full of Anthony Weiner
65:23 insurance folders full of crazy crazy
65:25 [ __ ] and the second that a security
65:28 agent looked at this stuff
65:30 and threw up and cried and screamed and
65:33 couldn't believe what they were looking
65:35 at they knew they had a problem on their
65:37 hands now some of these organizations
65:40 were controlled by the very
65:41 organizations that were protecting these
65:42 people so probably for at least a decade
65:45 the stuff went under the radar it's like
65:50 a pilot talking about a UFO they lose
65:51 their job but eventually enough of this
65:54 stuff started going through enough good
65:58 Patriots at least in the United States
66:00 of America can't speak for anyone else
66:03 I've met plenty of former NSA people and
66:07 I mean at the highest levels of this
66:09 organization at parties parties where
66:11 people grabbed me and said you got to
66:13 come over to this conversation and sit
66:15 down these guys need to talk to you and
66:16 you need to talk to them my life's been
66:18 very fortunate that way all these guys
66:21 couldn't believe a single conspiracy
66:22 because they were so patriotic I thought
66:25 well Jesus at least you're good people
66:27 that makes me feel good
66:29 I didn't know what to think I didn't
66:31 know how to form an opinion of them you
66:34 want to but she really can't and you
66:36 shouldn't then do you have a chance to
66:37 talk to these people but I guarantee you
66:40 the people that I have talked to every
66:41 single one of them if they had ever seen
66:46 perverted [ __ ] come across their screen
66:49 there would be nothing you could do to
66:51 convince them to hide it
66:53 to let it go by they would have to be
66:56 murdered and anyone they told would have
67:00 to be murdered for that stuff to go
67:02 unseen and unreported and unprosecuted I
67:09 think enough of it has occurred that
67:13 when you find out for instance and
67:15 you've seen this a million times in real
67:17 life when you find out you have drugs
67:18 being dealt in your neighborhood there's
67:20 a couple things you can do the silly
67:23 stupid thing you can do is have the drug
67:25 dealer busted the guy who's peddling his
67:28 [ __ ] on the corner used to have a guy
67:30 across the house poor dude across the
67:32 house the couple that was there divorced
67:35 and moved away and they the father who
67:37 owned the house rented it out and
67:38 immediately they got five guys in there
67:41 selling drugs this beautiful
67:46 neighborhood I'm in at the end of the
67:47 circle they had a fat lady come out in a
67:49 bikini disgusting [ __ ] fat girl come
67:52 out and roller skates with the drugs
67:56 give it to a BMW and the guy would
67:58 [ __ ] drive 60 miles an hour out of a
68:00 circle right speed limit 25 just went on
68:03 for a year I got pictures of this house
68:08 no you don't want to bro you don't want
68:10 to just arrest the drug dealer you want
68:13 the supplier because you want to nip
68:16 thing in the bud way at the beginning
68:18 the systemic problem has to be addressed
68:21 so these guys are seeing all this [ __ ]
68:24 come through and yeah they can run into
68:25 living rooms and grab all this child
68:27 porn stuff but then they send their
68:29 message and they probably did this and
68:31 they sent the message out oh my god [ __ ]
68:34 they can see our stuff we need code
68:35 words mr. pedesta you can't just say
68:37 what you were doing the statues of
68:39 Jeffrey Dahmer victims hanging in gold
68:42 in your
68:43 room Tony that were posted on the
68:46 Washington Post article in 2006 well
68:49 just like up Tony Podesta Jeffrey Dahmer
68:52 and brace yourself brace yourself this
68:56 [ __ ] was publicized by the Washington
68:59 Post and celebrated as a as a piece of
69:02 art I should tell you where your
69:05 loyalties are in the fact that Jeff
69:07 Bezos the [ __ ] Amazon guy buys the
69:09 place and all of a sudden its extra
69:10 [ __ ] truthful give me a goddamn break
69:13 what's going on right now was a plan
69:17 that took a long time to mature before
69:21 the first thing could occur which is a
69:24 change in leadership in this country the
69:28 agents that are absolutely scarred
69:31 probably several that no longer are here
69:34 on this planet either by way of taking
69:35 their own life or by having their life
69:38 taken for them our finally gonna see a
69:41 day of justice so I think that's what's
69:45 happening it's just been too much the
69:49 human mind cannot take it nobody wants
69:52 to say oh if I let this go by it could
69:54 be my kid and where's this going where
69:58 is this horrible trajectory of society
70:00 going that's going down the [ __ ]
70:03 tubes if you don't do something right
70:05 this is the beautiful nature of man once
70:07 a man sees himself threatened he could
70:09 then perceive the threat of others and
70:12 thank God we had enough empathetic
70:15 people viewing this material who weren't
70:18 complete [ __ ] mindless drones we're
70:21 willing to do whatever they're told
70:22 right
70:23 they teamed up they used their
70:25 incredibly huge brains and now we're
70:29 seeing the first volley of at all the
70:32 simple simple thing is this if you
70:35 believe in the absolute value of
70:40 children if you believe that children
70:43 shouldn't be tormented and tortured and
70:46 killed if that's what you believe and
70:51 believe me there are some people that
70:54 could watch this video who are acting
70:56 politicians who
70:57 say not me right but if you're a normal
71:02 human being in 99.9% carry that nine
71:05 several places from all cultures all
71:10 countries all races all genders they
71:14 believe that that is the case the kids
71:16 should be protected more than anything
71:18 let alone adults right but if we can
71:22 just agree the children shouldn't be
71:24 tormented by churches my crazy satanic
71:28 mother [ __ ] then we have everything
71:32 that we need LARP are no LARP I think
71:36 you feel me
71:37 this should is important people it's
71:39 really important there's not enough
71:42 filthy language you can use towards
71:44 these people I just use it for emphasis
71:48 right get on the bandwagon stop messing
71:52 around stop doubting hey if your
71:56 daughter then push harder on the project
71:59 push harder on cue and on if you're a
72:01 doubter push and push and you'll simply
72:05 find more and more evidence that it's
72:06 true and when you do you can take action
72:10 in your own way again just spread the
72:12 information you don't need to get
72:14 violent you don't
72:15 hey if someone's coming after you do
72:17 what you can to protect yourself but in
72:18 the end all we need to do is spread the
72:20 message the idea that can't be killed
72:24 which is the at a minimum at a minimum
72:27 we have to protect our kids and there's
72:29 two ways to protect your kids physically
72:31 and you protect them in a sovereign way
72:34 we must create a country in a world
72:38 every country excuse me a world that
72:41 they are free to express themselves we
72:45 must drive up their education to levels
72:47 ten times further than our own education
72:50 our children should be smarter than us
72:53 that's our goal in life and doesn't
72:54 matter if you've never had a child go
72:56 become a teacher we will become a
72:59 teacher teach kids and hey if you're
73:01 more I have to teach college students
73:02 because you don't like little kids fine
73:05 hey there's a bunch of people that are
73:06 out of college that still need more
73:07 education and they want it and you have
73:10 information that they need don't be
73:12 forceful because for every person that
73:14 you bump into that doesn't want the
73:16 information they just just move your
73:18 head you know one degree and there's
73:20 someone there right they're dying for it
73:22 they are confused they're scared they
73:25 don't know what's going on in the world
73:26 they wish they did they watch the news
73:27 and they just angst up because they have
73:29 no cause-and-effect they don't know how
73:32 the justice system works in this country
73:36 they don't know how laws are made they
73:38 don't know what executive order is they
73:40 don't know what the EU is they know what
73:42 the petrol dollar is fractional reserve
73:44 banking
73:44 there's a million soft subjects you can
73:47 talk about you know I would ease off on
73:50 the UFOs and reptiles and [ __ ] you know
73:52 and you'll save that for the day you're
73:55 all drinking it's not important right
73:57 now
73:57 it really is unimportant right now stick
74:00 with planet Earth flat around whatever
74:04 the [ __ ] you think it is and just fight
74:06 for what's wrong in this planet
