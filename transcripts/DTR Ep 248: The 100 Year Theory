00:00 [Music]
00:34 welcome back to G fellas and gentlemen
00:37 today we're gonna talk about a theory
00:41 that I'm bringing to you this is not me
00:44 talking about someone else experiences
00:46 something talking about their own theory
00:48 that's me deep thoughts here you go this
00:51 is called the hundred-year theory and
00:54 this is the culmination of many rumors
00:57 and claims over the years that you know
01:02 they always say well the military is 20
01:03 years ahead you know whatever you could
01:05 think of oh my god they're so far ahead
01:06 and for some people that's a very
01:08 romantic statement they love that idea
01:10 that their military is so advanced and
01:13 there have been reports in the u F ology
01:16 community where especially with Steven
01:20 Greer dr. Steven Greer project
01:22 disclosure one of the most credible
01:26 eyewitness interviews that he had was a
01:30 gentleman who was a guard I believe he
01:35 was in Chile I think that's where he was
01:39 South America somewhere and they attract
01:42 some vehicle traveling an amazing amount
01:45 of you know aeronautical miles per hour
01:50 seemingly crashing into the surface of
01:55 the earth and they rushed out to see
01:58 what the hell it was and this is when he
02:02 sort of confirmed that you know they saw
02:04 UFO
02:05 it was crashed into the side of a
02:07 mountain it was sort of like a teardrop
02:09 and he said the SCU's was coming out
02:14 the Chrome's surface of this vehicle was
02:16 sort of like a petroleum purple you know
02:19 like you look into a pond and it's got
02:22 all this wild white light refraction
02:24 going on here but he said no sooner did
02:26 he get closer to the vehicle and started
02:28 feeling like he was communicating with
02:30 the occupants inside that these vehicles
02:34 that he could not recognize he said
02:36 someone look like helicopters I believe
02:37 but because they were way advanced and
02:40 he goes they were traveling also very
02:42 quickly he goes they came out of nowhere
02:43 and started bullying everyone and what
02:48 was really fascinating was there part of
02:50 his story and again in terms of reading
02:55 a person's face and reading their their
02:57 tics and stuff to see without their
02:59 telling the truth this dude passes with
03:00 a ten out of ten so either he's been
03:03 hypnotized to believe this stuff or he
03:05 is really telling the truth because he
03:08 said some things that were very
03:11 interesting and he said that these sort
03:15 of commando guys showed up and he said
03:16 they didn't really have any I believe he
03:18 said didn't have any markings that were
03:20 based on a particular government
03:22 alliance however they did speak English
03:24 I was interesting they were very angry
03:27 that he and his colleagues were there
03:31 they said you're not supposed to be here
03:32 get the eff out of here
03:34 lots of f-bombs a lot of mists you know
03:36 treatment a lot of pushing him around he
03:38 said he was held captive for 14 hours
03:40 during some interrogation he said pretty
03:42 much they were just trying to scare me
03:44 for 14 hours straight to say you know
03:47 you didn't see this you do understand
03:49 right you didn't see this you didn't see
03:50 this which is so interesting that these
03:53 these people this accounting is very
03:57 common and you know if everyone's
04:00 everyone that wants to believe that the
04:01 rulers of the world are absolute evil
04:04 and I think some of them are and some of
04:07 them aren't really leaders they're just
04:09 perverts with money they participate not
04:12 in what happens in this planet but
04:14 they're let go right so there's a value
04:19 of life for these individuals which is
04:22 kind of cool but here's the theory it's
04:25 called the 100 year theory
04:27 what if our leaders are our owners
04:30 people you've never seen before in your
04:32 life
04:33 people of which you have known no idea
04:36 what their last names are there not
04:37 Rothschilds or not Hapsburgs their way
04:41 out of sight but they're at least 100
04:45 years ahead of us 100 years and I think
04:51 it's very interesting to propose this at
04:54 this particular stage of 2017 going into
04:57 2018 because we have reached a stage in
05:00 computer-generated imagery that if we
05:02 want to spend the time and the money we
05:05 could create any image that we need to
05:09 or want to and society I would say that
05:15 less than a fraction of a fraction of a
05:17 percent of people would even suspect it
05:19 wasn't real other than maybe what's
05:21 being enacted in this script not being
05:24 real right but visually speaking you
05:26 would say why are these living beings
05:27 telling this lie when the whole thing is
05:29 actually computer-generated that's just
05:31 one example right the kid in Chile who
05:34 sees the UFO and sees this band of folks
05:36 coming out of nowhere
05:37 is essentially saying look we took four
05:42 hours to get to this zone because it was
05:45 so jungle bound or whatever bad terrain
05:48 and these hooks just flew in and
05:50 seemingly two seconds right so when we
05:54 talk about things like being ahead we
05:58 have to quantify what metrics we're
06:02 talking about is it energy systems
06:05 propulsion systems is it medical is it
06:08 mental and spiritual is that a third eye
06:10 thing or is it all the above right the
06:16 House of Windsor very interesting family
06:20 the women tend to live especially if
06:24 they're not chainsmokers but in this day
06:26 and age as long as they take care of
06:27 themselves they make it 200 in that
06:30 family we haven't had a man pass away
06:33 within the ones our family for quite
06:34 some time that does seem to be this
06:36 obsessive push on Netflix to talk about
06:39 the ones your family
06:41 the deal is with that not all of its
06:43 favorable but in the end it kind of skis
06:46 through and you know there's some some
06:49 good things on the other side a parent
06:51 Li you know every episode of the crown
06:53 on Netflix has to be certified by the
06:58 Royal historians or whatever it's very
07:02 interesting I was told once this is a
07:03 non sequitur but I was told once that if
07:05 you wanted to have the Eiffel Tower in
07:07 your movie as a main character you
07:09 actually have to get permission from the
07:11 country of France to put it in your
07:12 movie such that you're not taking a dump
07:15 on it right if you want Godzilla to
07:16 knock it down they may turn you down
07:19 it's very interesting right I don't know
07:21 if we have the same thing and I don't
07:22 even know if that's true but I was told
07:23 that and the hallways of Hollywood ones
07:26 but there seems to be some medical
07:29 treatment that keeps people alive as
07:32 soon as you have a [ __ ] ton of money and
07:35 again what is it the the ones your
07:36 family owns like six point five percent
07:38 of the world's real estate and it's all
07:41 the good stuff right you know the the
07:44 Windsor family owns Canada every scrap
07:47 of land in Canada that's why she's on
07:49 the money
07:49 she owns all of Australia because it was
07:52 a penal colony
07:53 that's why she's on the money and she
07:57 owns a crapload of other and habitable
07:59 land all over the place right but that's
08:02 not who I'm talking about although there
08:04 would seem to be some medical care if
08:08 that is very sufficient to keep you 200
08:12 for whatever reason they have not
08:15 discovered hair restoration in the
08:17 Windsor family otherwise Prince William
08:21 would probably have a little more of a
08:23 high-top fade going on
08:25 luckily Charles is not the father of his
08:28 brother Harry so he has a full head of
08:30 red hair when they reported Harry living
08:34 every born they said he had
08:35 indiscriminate hair color oopsie
08:39 so let's get into the technology
08:43 computer processing technology is all
08:46 mostly indistinguishable ten years prior
08:50 right go back ten years you know like
08:52 geez man I would not want those systems
08:54 anymore
08:54 20 years it starts the feeling like a
08:57 dinosaur but what's interesting is if
09:01 you're 30 years old at least you can
09:03 look back on 10 years old and even
09:05 though it does seem like it's a you know
09:06 two lifetimes ago does it really seem
09:10 like it's F long ago when you get in
09:13 your 40s and 50s well 20 years is pretty
09:16 much you know a postage stamp in your
09:18 little diagram of time it's phenomenal
09:22 how fast it goes so imagine 100 years
09:26 take the superconductor or the
09:30 semiconductor excuse me take a silicon
09:33 chip take fiber optics and a
09:37 miniaturization objective and move it
09:40 back to say 1900 and say that right
09:45 around that time it was starting to be
09:47 figured out and by 20 or sorry by 1917
09:52 right when we in the World War one the
09:57 lead of the world have it working while
10:02 big giant computers are inside buildings
10:04 you know calculating calculus to shoot
10:07 artillery weapons during war for the new
10:09 upcoming war that's going to be really
10:11 fun and with late 30s early 40s the rock
10:15 and Tesla's stuff we know Tesla was onto
10:20 something the brother was building
10:23 machines without wires that ran
10:25 electricity he had you know a ceiling
10:28 that was lit without lights Mark Twain
10:31 said I never saw a wire in his building
10:37 hooked up to his machines at least he
10:41 was able to harvest free energy out of
10:45 his Tesla coils and then it stuck that
10:50 into the earth the earth then gave up
10:52 infinite supplies of pure energy out
10:55 which then he could do whatever the hell
10:56 he wanted to with so it wasn't that the
10:59 tower was going to the one you saw built
11:01 for him I think 1917 to 1927 the tower
11:05 itself wasn't the hundred percent
11:06 mechanism it was the
11:08 sort of the lure if you will to the fish
11:11 that is the electrons that are in the
11:13 plasma core of the earth and it was
11:16 built on an aqua ravine just like the
11:18 pyramids and the plateau but look at the
11:21 pyramids there are people that don't
11:25 believe that there were seeing
11:26 electricity that we're all just seeing
11:29 things
11:30 but now let's combine the pyramid story
11:33 of the pyramids being big giant
11:35 conductive batteries built out of
11:38 triangular pie and someone saying well I
11:43 didn't see any wires William you didn't
11:45 run electricity without wires and then
11:47 you think Mark Twain said Tesla didn't
11:50 have any wires when he built his big
11:53 giant antenna over ten years in the 19th
11:57 century he built it on top of a plateau
12:00 with an aqua ravine down below exactly
12:04 the way the pyramids were built so that
12:07 may simply be a way to lure a cloud of
12:09 electrons maybe even plasma energy to a
12:12 point where it it then collides with
12:15 conductive materials and becomes
12:18 aggravated valence which will turn into
12:21 electricity right we have conventional
12:26 bombs and bullets forever and ever and
12:29 ever right in fact jet propulsion bombs
12:33 you know built out of fireworks from the
12:36 Chinese
12:37 you know cannons during World War during
12:39 the Civil War and World War one and you
12:44 know we have muskets and stuff in the
12:47 Revolutionary War we had that forever
12:50 right
12:50 and then all of a sudden we've got a
12:53 nuclear [ __ ] bomb and I know that
12:58 I've done an episode on whether or not
12:59 they existed I've been watching tests by
13:03 the Russians for their hydrogen bomb and
13:07 the only thing that explains that being
13:10 not real for me further for the Russian
13:13 footage is it's very raw it's not like
13:15 they had the Hollywood machine that we
13:17 have here their hydrogen air tests
13:22 was one of the most amazing things I've
13:24 ever seen in my life on film we just
13:27 unbelievable plus the shock wave in the
13:30 devastation which was I think a little
13:32 bit different than than the one we have
13:34 they may have faked a model shot or two
13:36 just to scare back to the Americans see
13:39 we could blow up a building - or hold
13:40 city full of buildings but if this is
13:44 fake then the whole thing would need the
13:46 hundred-year theory to say ah well we
13:48 just figured out how to do 3d in pixel
13:52 Cartesian coordinate you know 3d matrix
13:56 X Y Z W but if you do that super deep
14:02 dive into atomic weapons you'll probably
14:05 fork off into the they don't exist thing
14:08 which I have an episode on if you want
14:10 to see that I believe it's in season 2
14:11 and then you have the other theory which
14:14 is these things have existed for
14:17 thousands of years and these bizarre
14:20 scars on the desert of the Middle East
14:23 some people are saying that those were
14:28 bombs that were used thousands of years
14:32 ago and that reset mankind they blame it
14:36 on a false understanding of how the
14:38 earth works and they call out ice ages
14:40 which are complete [ __ ] with that is
14:43 the reason why we believe that the man
14:46 resets all the time okay now if you by
14:50 the way cross over into do craters exist
14:53 episode that I did then round pockets of
14:57 condensed sort of either in the in the
15:01 desert could be glass because it's
15:02 melting sand or anywhere else in the
15:05 world again craters are always perfectly
15:08 circular and that's not the way that a
15:09 random body from space would ever
15:11 collide with a sphere rotating going
15:16 around Sun you know baby one in a
15:19 billion would be perfectly circular and
15:21 the rest would all have some elliptical
15:23 hit point just like again the the crash
15:26 of Superman's little ship from Krypton
15:30 right so let's keep going this start off
15:33 the the 19th century
15:35 excuse me in the 20th century excuse me
15:37 1900 to 2000 with the fact that my
15:40 grandmother said that by the age of 8 to
15:44 10 her sister and her used to see cigar
15:47 shaped vehicles flying in the sky of
15:49 little trail behind it she was born in
15:52 1912 so this would be 1920 to 1925
15:57 somewhere and there is an infant she saw
16:00 these things my grandmother never told a
16:02 tale in her entire life to me
16:05 never never embellished anything
16:10 unbelievable which is good so when she
16:13 sat down and told me and I looked at her
16:14 and she kinda looked at me funny like
16:17 don't think I'm crazy I haven't told
16:19 anybody this and she kind of said it
16:23 nonchalant like yeah we used to see
16:26 these all the time
16:27 and we don't see him anymore so if you
16:31 want to think about the Wright brothers
16:33 really conquering the skies and my
16:35 grandmother starting to see these things
16:37 right so the Wright brothers really get
16:39 credit in 1907
16:40 this is in approximately five years
16:43 before my grandmother was born but they
16:45 actually flew in 1904 but the Patent
16:47 Office or a bunch of [ __ ] and said
16:50 no no no we don't want to pay a civilian
16:53 for flight we want to own this as the
16:55 the Navy the Naval Air Force that
16:57 eventually came out of the military
16:59 right but that might explain
17:03 why my grandmother was able to see
17:05 something that couldn't technically
17:07 exist and quite frankly what if it was a
17:10 blimp what I can't understand is the the
17:14 plume that comes out of the back but
17:15 again you know tons of people have taken
17:18 photographs of these things I shouldn't
17:20 say tons but there are a few photographs
17:21 of it right and that's a way to get
17:24 around the world and look around in Peru
17:28 we have all these situations where
17:30 they've dug all these drawings into the
17:33 ground but you can only see from space
17:36 well perhaps there was a point where the
17:38 folks that have this technology were
17:41 messing around creating a little bit of
17:42 artwork and then kind of like to each
17:44 other and says you know what it'd
17:46 probably be best if we didn't let all
17:48 these Neanderthals and all these bizarre
17:50 you know jungle people and rainforest
17:53 people which would be most of us at the
17:55 time pretending potentially when they
17:58 discover this technology which we have
18:00 no idea when but it's better that we
18:02 hold this to ourselves because they're
18:03 gonna use it for military and really
18:05 horrible stuff but we just want to kind
18:07 of sip champagne and look around right
18:10 1947 we have a vehicle that crashes in
18:14 the middle of the night due to a storm I
18:16 was extremely skeptical about the crash
18:19 of Roswell until I did my deep dive
18:20 please see my episode on the Roswell das
18:24 roll crash of 1947 I think something did
18:27 crash I think they did see something out
18:30 of this world and I think there were
18:31 beings on this vehicle and the only way
18:35 I think that it didn't happen would be
18:37 that all the eyewitness testimony that I
18:40 have heard general Ramiz and and all of
18:43 his constituents that worked on weather
18:45 balloons a hundred percent of the time
18:47 especially the people that were playing
18:48 the bridge game they would have had to
18:52 have all been hypnotized and convinced
18:54 of this completely which reveals a whole
18:56 other technology that I'm unaware that
18:57 we have so as long as that didn't occur
19:01 this thing occurred now whether or not
19:04 we have nine other vehicles and thought
19:07 you know Bob Lazar sitting in this for
19:08 reverse engineering some antimatter
19:10 engine I don't know I don't know but
19:13 this theory isn't kind of basically say
19:17 yeah Oh totally and not only did we
19:20 recover this stuff but perhaps the alien
19:22 dude just said oh yeah this is how it
19:23 works that depicted them which kind of
19:26 cuts out Bob Lazar as need to be their
19:28 medicine
19:30 so medicine goes both the positive and a
19:33 negative in the 100 year theory
19:36 obviously the positive is to keep these
19:39 individuals extremely healthy put them
19:43 in a little booth like Prometheus and
19:47 you just say analyze me and fix me right
19:50 but the dangerous part is to genetically
19:54 engineer the rest of us those of us who
19:58 are not flying around in cigars
20:00 observing the world in toasting
20:02 champagne we know that hexagonal
20:05 crystals are being dropped out of skies
20:08 using patented nano dye technology and
20:12 then a piezo effect hits the little
20:15 crystals and it starts to eject these
20:16 cylindrical extrusions which can
20:22 encapsulate all kinds of inventions like
20:25 gene splicing nano devices so you get
20:29 the theory of Morgellons disease right
20:33 we know that vaccinations are this huge
20:36 push by the world elite to utterly
20:39 hobble the minds of children you know
20:42 I've got probably three average you know
20:46 acquaintances of mine on Facebook that
20:48 post raw raw vaccination videos of
20:50 children being literally shot up with
20:52 four to six shots at a time the child
20:54 screaming and crying and this [ __ ] is
20:56 posting in a Facebook like oh isn't that
21:00 cute my buddy John John VIII so I'll say
21:04 he is an absolute warrior of great
21:07 information and he keeps he posts he's
21:11 just he's really taking it on the chin I
21:12 think probably with his friends and
21:14 family to bring the truth out and I
21:16 friends with him so I post a lot his
21:19 stuff over on our side but understanding
21:22 the absolute destructive nature of
21:24 injecting aluminum and mercury into a
21:27 human body regardless of what you think
21:30 you're doing through
21:31 immunization or inoculation those two
21:35 substances should never be put in the
21:37 human body right there was a big thing
21:41 in the 70s at least the I discovered in
21:44 the 70s about lead poisoning used to be
21:46 leaded gas and they pulled all the let
21:48 out because you'd sit there and breathe
21:49 it your fumes would come around from
21:51 your car gasoline and I guess make you
21:54 sick
21:55 lead paint it was banned because my
22:01 there was a funny little thing where I
22:04 was whatever reason I didn't have
22:07 markers I didn't have crayons I guess
22:10 but I had a coloring book so I had this
22:12 pencil and I'm sitting there going you
22:16 know I'm like three or four years old
22:18 I'm pissed that I've all I've got is a
22:20 pencil to fill this thing in and I I'm
22:24 pretty sure I would have had a curry on
22:25 somewhere but whatever reason I couldn't
22:27 couldn't find it or whatever I don't
22:28 think I had any dogs so pissed off they
22:30 wouldn't get me any at the time like I'm
22:32 an artist man I need [ __ ] also in a fit
22:35 of rage I [ __ ] stabbed my coloring
22:40 book with my pencil my number-two pencil
22:43 it went straight through the comic or
22:46 the the comic book the coloring book
22:47 right into my right knee right above the
22:51 kneecap and it broke the tip of the
22:54 pencil off into my leg and it is still
22:57 there to this day
22:58 but I remember my parents thinking oh my
23:01 god you know is he gonna have lead
23:02 poisoning and all this other stuff now I
23:05 didn't take it to take him to doctor get
23:06 this out of my leg I don't know
23:08 and what's actually interesting is that
23:10 there's a circle of hair around this
23:12 that doesn't grow yeah that's what
23:15 happened to me like my father said it's
23:17 not lead
23:18 honey it's carbon and I don't know
23:21 what's true actually I've never looked
23:22 that up it's all faded now into my leg
23:27 like a like an old tattoo but now think
23:32 of what we as let's just call ourselves
23:33 the peasants the sheep the cattle have
23:36 been able to kind of uncover about the
23:38 genetic code of man again if you study
23:42 bruce lipton you're gonna find out that
23:44 you
23:44 been utterly deceived with the genome
23:46 project medical doctors are taught dogma
23:49 theory it's a real thing about how the
23:52 theory of the cell works which is
23:54 incorrect the nucleus of the cells not
23:57 the brain of the cell the membrane of
23:59 the cell membrane is the actual
24:04 commander-in-chief of the human cell the
24:08 center is used to repair the cell but it
24:11 is not the wind should I do this thingy
24:14 a chromosome is always glorified in
24:18 Hollywood as this double helix bag of
24:22 DNA no you know nucleic acid chains but
24:25 it's actually 50% protein patterns which
24:28 are the schematics to tell the DNA what
24:30 to do so the genome project has
24:32 basically 50% of the information it's
24:34 missing the other 50% which is what
24:36 protein patterns tell the chromosomes to
24:39 do what I just went to a Bruce Lipton
24:42 site just go to Bruce Lipton com
24:44 and there's a book that he read and
24:48 wrote which I paid 70 bucks for back in
24:50 the day is called wisdom of your cells
24:51 or wisdom of the cells or something like
24:53 that you can actually listen to him read
24:55 it on YouTube but the three books that
24:57 he has available right now don't have
24:59 that book and I don't know why I don't
25:02 know usually there's like a royalty
25:04 problem for any of you who know Bill
25:06 still bill stills work on the money
25:09 changers he created this three and a
25:11 half hour video in the 90s where he did
25:13 this impeccable job running around the
25:16 world educating us about various
25:17 currencies and it turns out he got had
25:22 by a jerk who took all the money and so
25:25 he no longer really promotes that you
25:27 can still buy it but he doesn't make any
25:29 money from it so he created oz like The
25:34 Wizard it's not the Wizard of Oz but
25:35 it's his version is read his redo of it
25:38 that's only a couple hours long it's got
25:40 a much higher production value if you
25:42 really want to see the bomb you go look
25:44 at money changers from the 90s as well
25:46 as his other ones he's got another one
25:48 on Jekyll Island as well but now let's
25:51 think about this for a second some of
25:54 you might roll your eyes and go well
25:55 this is a pathetic attempt to create a
25:57 theory
25:58 hmm all right maybe let's go one step
26:03 further we think of a hundred-year
26:07 theory as strictly being something to do
26:09 with technology
26:12 whether it be creating computer graphics
26:14 they're indistinguishable with reality -
26:18 medicine - all kinds of different forms
26:21 of science but let me tell you probably
26:24 one of the most powerful things that you
26:27 probably already believe which makes the
26:29 hundred-year theory perhaps a 10,000
26:32 year theory or even more and that is
26:38 those who know true history are probably
26:42 the most powerful people in existence
26:48 if you truly know who the leaders of the
26:51 world have been if you truly know the
26:54 stages of various societies I mean from
26:57 the encapsulated Aborigines that were
26:59 discovered on the continent of of
27:02 Australia to the Eskimos to the Native
27:05 Americans to the Incas down below we
27:09 call our you know southern Latin folks
27:13 if they weren't really Latin until Spain
27:16 came over but all the different stages
27:18 of Europe all the different stages of
27:20 Asia and Eurasia and Africa
27:23 if you truly knew all the history
27:26 everything that's ever occurred how
27:28 powerful do you become right there's two
27:34 different forms of mental behavioral
27:36 science there's sociology the study of
27:39 groups and then there's psychology the
27:42 study of the individual mind what if you
27:45 had 50,000 years worth of knowledge
27:49 about it the frailties the strengths the
27:52 weaknesses all that stuff right
27:55 especially the sociology side of things
27:57 a group of people are willing to
27:59 tolerate this they are not willing to
28:02 tolerate that if you want them to
28:04 tolerate that you've got to boil them
28:06 like a frog really slow a bin - whatever
28:09 change that you want to have happen
28:12 at that point the rulers of the world
28:14 would not really you know it'd be like
28:18 well we've done socialism a hundred
28:20 times we've done capitalism a hundred
28:23 times yeah you know they have eternal
28:26 flaws because the the tiny little
28:29 electrons in the circuitry of society
28:31 which are individuals vary so widely in
28:34 cultural differences in educational
28:36 differences religion and religious
28:37 differences you know we really we can't
28:40 say we have subatomic particles in
28:43 society that behave the same imagine
28:45 you're trying to build a computer that
28:47 relies on electrons but the behavior of
28:51 every electron is a little bit different
28:53 you get a kind of a surge of Christian
28:55 electrons that seem to do one thing with
28:57 that coil over there and you get a bunch
28:59 of jihadists over here that seem to do
29:01 this with the the capacitor over here
29:03 and you can't get things to do what
29:05 they're supposed to do because
29:06 everyone's completely different and they
29:07 disagree and the other part is for all
29:11 of those of you who have said the
29:13 government is twenty years ahead of
29:14 everyone else right I think 99.9% of
29:18 anyone who says that is merely mocking
29:21 something that they've heard online
29:22 right the other fraction of a percent
29:26 are individuals that have worked for the
29:28 military in Skunk work projects and then
29:32 you have this sort of relative
29:34 definition of advanced right now what if
29:41 I built a little robot that was pretty
29:44 cute and I come get you you're my
29:46 neighbor you watch this show you're an
29:48 average human being or maybe above
29:50 average because you watch this show and
29:52 I bring you over and I say hey check
29:55 this out
29:55 buh-buh-buh-buh knight run him around he
29:57 does whatever he does and you're like
29:58 man that's pretty cool that's pretty
30:00 cool that one thing you did yeah I
30:01 haven't seen anyone anyone do that
30:03 before but I'm sure someone's done in
30:04 the military or something like that but
30:06 that's pretty cool and so we have a
30:09 little fun moment you're like wow you
30:10 you know you're a little ahead of you
30:12 know other folks that don't build robots
30:15 but you wouldn't say you know if I'm
30:20 like 20 years ahead you might go to your
30:22 neighbors and got - guys really cranking
30:25 out some cool stuff okay now let's say
30:29 for some reason I could go to Africa and
30:31 go to one of these tribes where they
30:33 picked their mate by how tall or how
30:35 high the guy can jump every day wakes up
30:38 he puts on clay and he wears it for a
30:40 week and they draw all kinds of patterns
30:42 if they're gonna go hunt a lion they
30:44 they put the hunting patter on if he's
30:46 gonna mate with his wife to create life
30:49 he paints a different fertility pattern
30:50 or whatever and I bring that guy over
30:53 here and then I show him the laptop I'm
30:57 using to record this episode the camera
30:59 the then I eventually show him the robot
31:01 and then he goes back to home to his
31:04 tribe safe and sound
31:05 and again for some reason we speak each
31:08 other's language either I learn his or
31:10 he learns mine or whatever he's gonna
31:12 say oh my god this dude because I don't
31:17 let him see anything else this one guy
31:19 has built things you can't even imagine
31:21 he is thousands of years ahead of us
31:25 thousands of years ahead of us and he be
31:29 probably correct he'd probably be
31:32 correct I mean think about how how the
31:34 average household in Europe or America
31:36 or wherever any modern first world you
31:40 can probably some third world places are
31:42 so much further ahead than tribes that
31:45 haven't been really discovered probably
31:46 but as governor left alone because they
31:48 live a perfect life so when you think
31:50 about yourself in comparison to the
31:52 hundred-year theory
31:54 the only thing keeping you from probably
31:56 considering it to be true would be the
31:59 hubris of defense you saying I don't
32:05 want to believe that because that puts
32:07 me in jeopardy and the only thing that
32:10 puts you in jeopardy in your mind is the
32:12 the ill intent of said technologies if
32:16 someone said you know the elite of the
32:19 world have figured out how to cure
32:21 cancer they have got anti-gravity
32:23 vehicles they can travel the universe
32:25 and come back the UFOs that we have seen
32:28 our entire life they're not foreign
32:31 aliens coming in those are our captors
32:34 those of you are into Flat Earth and you
32:37 believe in a firmament dome the dome
32:39 owners this is a Truman Show it doesn't
32:42 solve for God but it definitely erases
32:44 religion now if you want to take the
32:47 hundred-year theory and make it the
32:48 hundred thousand year theory then you
32:50 could have individuals come down here
32:53 and behave like messiahs to get
32:56 everything on the right track and then
32:59 you could think about it in the sense
33:01 that all of the the Jesus parables which
33:04 go back to easily 4500 BC with Queen
33:09 Semiramis Ishtar and her husband Nimrod
33:12 and her daughter and her son Tomas well
33:17 I guess with technology smoke and
33:20 mirrors this could be the case there's a
33:23 great Star Trek episode and I am
33:26 struggling at this moment to remember
33:28 exactly which show it was in but there
33:33 was a primitive planet
33:36 well sorry excuse me sorry that's
33:37 actually not true there's actually a
33:38 very advanced planet that had what they
33:40 believed to be the devil come back to
33:43 claim her superiority over their world
33:47 and it turns out she's obviously a
33:51 charlatan and a scan scam artist but
33:53 they believed that several thousand
33:56 years ago if not just a thousand years
33:58 ago that they had signed a treaty with
34:00 the devil that the devil would provide a
34:03 wonderful future for them for millennia
34:06 or so and then
34:07 she would come back to claim ownership
34:10 over the planet everyone would be
34:12 enslaved and so this woman had a cloaked
34:16 spaceship this is the spoiler cloak
34:18 spaceship around this planet and she was
34:21 using special effects and all kinds of
34:23 tectonic plates shaking to create
34:25 earthquakes and a bunch of illusion
34:28 projection stuff were she could be
34:31 anything that you wanted her to be
34:33 because when the Star Trek people came
34:35 down she turned into a Klingon must been
34:38 next generation yeah because Worf was
34:41 definitely there she turns to do a
34:44 Klingon devil a human you know like the
34:47 whole goat devil for us etc etc and
34:50 she's eventually discovered that's right
34:52 because Geordi figured it out that's
34:53 right well that's sort of an archetype
34:56 for the hundred-year theory especially
34:59 if applied to religion but now some of
35:02 you might be thinking the entire time
35:04 have been talking well dude if they had
35:06 such amazing ecliptic control over us
35:09 then why does 9/11 have a bunch of holes
35:11 in it why do all these fake massacres of
35:16 all these holes I mean if they're that
35:17 advanced why is there why are there all
35:19 these problems constantly and for those
35:23 of you who are Georgia Guidestones fans
35:25 where it says they're gonna basically
35:27 murder 99.9 percent of the entire world
35:29 at some point with their little updated
35:32 stone for 2014 as if something had taken
35:36 place then why haven't they done it
35:38 already if they're so powerful in my
35:43 opinion this is where it gets
35:44 interesting what if we've confused the
35:49 owners of this place with bankers with
35:54 royalty
35:55 mm-hmm says a couple theories there if
36:00 our owners are different than the
36:01 banking cartel that pisses us off and
36:04 the monarchies that still [ __ ] exist
36:07 on planet earth I mean can you believe
36:10 that people worship kings and queens can
36:14 you believe it that they put someone
36:17 else's face on their money that just as
36:19 is really
36:21 the kingpin of serfdom in America we put
36:26 our leaders on our money leaders that
36:28 did things that were at least
36:31 perceivably noble at the time that they
36:33 existed you know Abraham Lincoln for
36:35 God's sakes
36:36 not just you were born into some opulent
36:39 bunch of [ __ ] right so if you
36:43 separate that layer of aristocracy from
36:47 the owners then you have to establish
36:48 the relationship there a lot of us have
36:53 come to the conclusion you know isn't it
36:55 interesting that the only people that
36:57 seem to ever rise up to power are total
37:01 [ __ ] and you know there's a burden
37:04 of being the king for sure absolutely
37:08 but the number one thing that someone in
37:10 an elite power structure would want for
37:13 its people is education let's educate
37:15 everyone so that war goes away let's
37:17 educate everyone so suffering goes away
37:20 and let's just see what the human mind
37:22 and body can do there we're now in full
37:25 swing of a transhumanism movement to say
37:27 oh humans are so inferior and so bad
37:30 let's hand it off like some automata
37:32 sewed where we're gonna spend a bunch of
37:34 robots to take us take over our place
37:37 well we haven't remotely attempted to
37:40 see what human beings can do I mean we
37:42 have just really crawled out of our own
37:47 primal past and forget whether it's
37:51 evolution or creationism we know that
37:54 even if God created us and just went
37:56 poof you're right there we were
37:58 barbarians just within the last hundred
38:01 and fifty years all right it is
38:05 interesting when you do find these
38:06 tribes out there in the rainforests of
38:08 South America and in the jungles of or
38:11 even in them you know the the deserts of
38:14 Africa that there's extremely peaceful
38:18 people it's amazing you know they do
38:20 have a lot of crazy cannibalism and they
38:22 have a lot of genocidal wars but most of
38:24 that is the proliferation of modern
38:26 thought into these regions right of
38:29 course they've had to fight over
38:30 resources and land at times but I think
38:32 the land pretty much keeps the cow
38:34 of a population down quite a bit until
38:37 you start creating shelters and villages
38:39 and towns and that sort of thing but now
38:41 what if the owners aren't associated
38:43 with the actual goings-on inside this
38:46 dome they're watching an experiment
38:49 they're our idea their whole idea is not
38:52 to interfere too much because the the
38:54 base principle of sociological
38:56 experiment says don't let the people
38:58 that you're watching know that you're
38:59 watching them because then they behave
39:01 differently at the same time there may
39:05 be this sort of lays off fair approach
39:08 if UFOs that we have seen from time to
39:10 time are them in some sort of leisurely
39:14 cruise just looking at their their
39:17 property looking at the experiment from
39:19 different levels I mean wouldn't you
39:21 want to go to another planet if you had
39:23 a planet sequestered somewhere you know
39:25 you know if you got your you got your
39:28 little bubble from the folks from Nagre
39:30 Thea you want to look at it sure Star
39:34 Trek is again massaged the prime
39:37 directive since the next generation it
39:41 was really funny you know you have to
39:42 take the 60s it would seem as if the
39:44 prime directive didn't exist you know
39:46 Kirk was like not only am I gonna go
39:48 down there and talk to these people
39:49 don't tap that green ass you know yeah
39:52 well we care he took really care so then
39:56 you have this question you have to
39:59 answer which would be if you were the
40:01 ruling class in this world the bankers
40:05 the royalty and according to the the
40:08 series on Netflix the crown the Queen of
40:11 England is actually you know relatively
40:16 uneducated I don't know if she continues
40:18 getting educated but it was a very
40:19 fascinating thing that they were trying
40:20 to say that she was sort of uh she was
40:24 supposed to be an abject [ __ ] it was as
40:26 if they didn't want her to learn
40:27 anything and then she started taking
40:29 ownership of her own mind a little bit
40:30 but she did you know she cranked out
40:32 four kids and you know she took all this
40:38 responsibility according to you know to
40:40 history
40:41 but the idea would be do they know about
40:45 captors for those of your flat-earthers
40:49 think about the fact that maybe there is
40:51 some firmament wall past the ice and
40:54 there's their doors or there are no
40:56 doors or whatever reason
40:59 by having ultimate control over at least
41:02 what we understand is technology in this
41:03 world they're able to communicate with
41:08 the captors the people that have us and
41:11 I when I say captors it brings up some
41:13 pretty bad imagery such it probably is a
41:15 different word it's not like we're
41:16 locked in the basement you know being
41:19 tortured and raped or something they're
41:21 just the people that would have put
41:22 together this experiment again I think
41:25 it's fascinating that the one thing that
41:28 keeps ringing in my brain is that there
41:29 moon is too big for Earth and then
41:32 people are trying to study the curvature
41:33 of Earth will get to the point where
41:35 they realized there's there is curvature
41:37 even in the Flat Earth folks there's a
41:39 little bit of curvature but if you were
41:42 to say okay take the sphere that you
41:44 think is earth and make it no no just
41:47 for the sake of argument ten times as
41:49 big and we are simply a little circular
41:51 patch on this thing like the truman show
41:54 dome right the truman show dome seemed
41:56 like it was an entire world it was a big
41:58 city and obviously there was a big earth
42:00 outside that and everyone's watching
42:02 that what's in the truman show as a as a
42:05 form of entertainment hell we we have
42:09 michael crichton's west world which is
42:11 now all over HBO being beautifully
42:13 created might i say and it is again it
42:16 is sort of the firmament dome thing and
42:19 people inside there the robots
42:21 especially the non-player characters
42:25 they they don't know that they're in
42:29 this thing they wake up they have a
42:31 routine again they're not aware of a
42:33 border but they don't care they like
42:35 where they are I've said it several
42:37 times on the show when I grew up in a
42:39 small town there was there were times
42:41 when I would go god six to ten months
42:44 not leaving a six-mile Township a six
42:47 mile square patch of land and I didn't
42:51 care I had everything I needed my music
42:53 my computers
42:55 motorcycle whatever I had it all so that
43:00 maybe if there is very little
43:02 communication perhaps no communication
43:05 between those that would be in this
43:08 pocket of advanced technology and those
43:10 that are basically bankers here then
43:13 things like 911 are floppy and weird and
43:16 strange and of all these holes in them
43:18 because it's not part of that group but
43:21 I think I want to rewind here for one
43:23 second to give you a little bit a bit of
43:24 a pinch point in this story let's slow
43:28 down the theory the hundred-year theory
43:31 is based on the notion that human beings
43:34 would have figured out I'm gonna say
43:36 human beings probably with an asterisk
43:38 over it but someone thought wisely that
43:44 coveting technology provides extreme
43:47 power right what if we didn't tell
43:52 people we had a computer what if we
43:54 didn't tell people we had medicine that
43:56 could make you feel better
43:57 matter of fact what do we the Egyptians
44:00 who have I think fairly well proven that
44:03 they had a deep understanding of
44:05 electricity and the Egyptian Masons who
44:09 are now in our you know 90s and hundreds
44:11 who are saying look we used to heal
44:13 human bodies using frequencies of sound
44:16 and electricity to resonate out the
44:21 invaders and the human body so you got a
44:23 bacteria in your body you resonate the
44:24 body with a particular frequency and it
44:26 shatters the cellular membranes of the
44:29 invaders it shatters the RNA patterns
44:33 that are trying to steal the replication
44:35 of your DNA when it splits in half they
44:38 covet they hold it back but they nurture
44:42 it and nurture it and nurture it most of
44:45 you know that probably at least eighty
44:49 years ago if not further back we have
44:52 fairly solid evidence that secret
44:55 laboratories were created two or three
44:57 in the world at least and they have
45:02 spliced human beings with absolutely
45:04 everything you could conceive of as well
45:06 as insects and animals
45:09 animals and animals insects and insects
45:12 humans and insects humans and animals
45:14 there their stories coming out all the
45:16 time now that we have spliced together I
45:19 think a goat human or a pig human this
45:23 is just like breaking stories in
45:25 December of 2017
45:26 so we're pissing and moaning that
45:29 someone wants to use stem cells to cure
45:32 people like Christopher Reeve before he
45:34 died when you don't have to get stem
45:37 cells out of baby you know infant dead
45:40 babies but what if a child did pass away
45:43 and and you know if the adults got his
45:45 whole organ transplant thing all signed
45:48 up on the back of his driver's license
45:49 but you can't take a baby that's passed
45:51 away and cure I don't know 100 people
45:54 who are quadriplegic or paraplegic I
45:58 couldn't think of a better use of a
46:00 tragedy than to do that I don't know
46:04 what the ratio is of what you could
46:05 harvest from a child like that and I
46:07 know that sounds horrible but your baby
46:10 was not the flesh and bone your baby was
46:15 a soul you may even have that child
46:17 again if you continue having children
46:20 well let's also look at some sectors of
46:22 where technology allows domination we
46:26 have essentially geographical spatial
46:30 areas of domination we have first and
46:33 foremost land can you command an army of
46:37 people an army of technology to conquer
46:40 land to take someone's back yard front
46:42 yard home everything and then convince
46:44 them through paradigm that you're
46:46 superior to them and they should be the
46:47 authoritative figures over you convince
46:51 a bunch of bullies to you know carry
46:54 guns and call themselves you know law
46:56 enforcement this is no slam on law
46:58 enforcement but you know we're talking
47:00 about these people creating covert
47:04 operations to do things so you have a
47:09 bunch of paradigm that you teach the
47:10 mind that's one region of existence
47:12 where again how many of you talk about
47:14 national debt how many of you talk about
47:16 debt in general well debt is in your
47:18 brain
47:19 that is a complete construct in your
47:21 brain that doesn't really exist in
47:23 society all right we shouldn't covet
47:27 resources so that we have more and
47:29 someone else has less we do have to
47:32 control our population it is true but
47:35 where else are there geographical places
47:37 spatial places where domination is
47:40 important if you're one of them if you
47:42 want to control the experiment
47:44 well the see was the next one right
47:47 Magellan running around first we
47:51 conquered the coastlines because we
47:53 always had resources if we as long as we
47:56 were right next to land we could always
47:57 go into land grab some food grab some
47:59 resources maybe even repair a boat with
48:01 some wood we might have to learn some
48:04 new food supplies I'm sure there were
48:06 coastlines with no food at all
48:07 coastlines that were too intense to
48:10 traverse especially ice coastlines but
48:15 you could create a greenery inside your
48:17 ship and when you've found a jackpot if
48:20 you grab a bunch put it on the boat and
48:22 get a you know way down the coastline go
48:24 past a couple bad areas and then we got
48:27 into sort of what they call deep sea you
48:30 know the center of oceans you could
48:32 cross big oceans and then we created
48:34 before planes we created submarines and
48:40 so we started going down into the ocean
48:42 down into the water and started kind of
48:44 trying to dominate this gigantic
48:45 infinitely large in comparison to
48:48 landmass areas because it's very
48:50 three-dimensional right on the surface
48:52 of a continent you basically have a
48:54 Cartesian coordinate system and XY you
48:56 don't have Z until he started maybe
48:59 digging military tunnels or something
49:01 right next up the sky and this guy comes
49:05 in layers doesn't it the first vehicles
49:08 couldn't go that high at all World War
49:10 one was fought with biplanes not very
49:13 high up by World War two we started
49:15 going up it much higher thousands of
49:18 feet up into the sky now when I visit
49:23 relatives in the Midwest well I'm
49:26 traveling at 35,000 feet seven miles on
49:30 average if I get on a private g5
49:33 I'm gonna go another 10,000 miles over
49:35 that okay
49:38 well let's keep going we know we know
49:41 Rockets launch I just watched the SpaceX
49:44 launch yesterday over Los Angeles
49:46 absolutely wild looking so we know that
49:51 these exist they do launch rockets
49:53 whether or not you think that they drop
49:55 air balloons up there or whatever
49:57 doesn't matter there's now domination at
50:02 about 200 miles up to probably about 350
50:06 before the Van Allen belts start killing
50:08 human beings right
50:09 we have intercontinental ballistic
50:11 missiles seems pretty uh pretty real man
50:15 you know we've seen right after the moon
50:17 missions were over you know moon
50:19 missions the whole purpose was to create
50:21 military rockets not hey let's go to the
50:24 moon it wasn't about that at all they
50:26 didn't give a [ __ ] about the moon that's
50:27 why it never happened I'm sure they
50:30 would have if they coulda but they knew
50:32 they were another hundred to two hundred
50:34 years away from that little game but now
50:39 let's talk about those of you while
50:41 we're there we have outerspace leaving
50:45 earth well it could go a lot of places
50:49 really really fast for those of you been
50:51 studying the lunar waves you're now
50:53 looking at the moon and Project Blue
50:55 Beam probably for the last 10 years or
50:58 so combining all the knowledge together
50:59 and essentially realizing that well
51:05 maybe the moon is a projection I know it
51:09 sounds crazy I'm not exactly a believer
51:12 in that but I tell you what the lunar
51:13 wave thing is really bizarre when you
51:16 try to compensate for the distortion of
51:19 the atmosphere you know some view or
51:22 firmament don't believers believe it's a
51:24 wave in the ocean I think it'd be a lot
51:26 more aggressive if there was actually
51:27 some sort of wave up there but you know
51:33 if you want to believe that the moon is
51:34 a projection then you can certainly
51:36 account for the fact that it's too big
51:38 but it's a lot of work folks it's a lot
51:40 of work if you're to put something out
51:42 there and I don't know any benefit at
51:44 all putting it up there that we are in
51:46 some
51:47 sort of World of Warcraft it's some
51:50 massive multiplayer online role-playing
51:52 game right hey maybe maybe at that point
51:58 a hundred-year theory is way beyond
52:01 100-year theory and it is definitely in
52:05 a way true now for those of you who have
52:10 picked up on my Ottoman reference
52:12 there's a movie called autumn ax that's
52:14 what I'm calling it
52:15 it's got Tonio Banderas it's now free
52:17 again on Netflix it's a long watch first
52:21 half I think is utterly brilliant and
52:23 qualifies as sort of a prequel to the
52:25 world of Blade Runner - the depopulation
52:29 arc in the story but you know this is
52:33 gonna be a little bit of a spoiler alert
52:37 see if I can say this without giving up
52:39 the spoiler sometimes I've said they're
52:40 spoilers and I don't give it up but
52:42 essentially their humanity experienced
52:46 this this horrible problem this is in
52:48 the credits at the very beginning so
52:49 this isn't a spoiler at all you can't
52:51 get into the first live-action scene
52:52 without understanding this part of it
52:54 which is the Sun gets really active and
52:57 starts to radiate the earth and they
53:00 don't really blame it on global warming
53:02 or anything like that but it just starts
53:03 to radiate as so much that we have to
53:05 put these sort of blimps up in the sky
53:07 to create I guess a a rain cleansing
53:13 ritual where everyone has to go inside
53:16 the rain cleanses all this radioactive
53:18 material out of the sky and then it
53:20 washes down into the drains and everyone
53:22 can have kind of a day outside for a
53:23 little while
53:23 most people are inside and they needed
53:26 to create these things very quickly to
53:28 save society and so they created this
53:29 robot called the pilgrim in the pilgrim
53:33 was very handy very well received by
53:35 humanity because humanity was obviously
53:37 having a huge problem surviving this
53:38 altar alteration in the Sun and Tony
53:42 wonderous is a insurance agent for the
53:46 robot company to built the program and
53:48 they're kind of struggling because
53:49 Society rebelled against the pilgrim at
53:51 some point it's not really explained but
53:54 it's very similar to Douglas Adams story
53:57 The Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy
54:00 when everyone rebelled against the
54:02 robots and the robots didn't understand
54:06 why they were being rebelled against
54:07 they're like look we're following
54:08 azimoff's prime objectives / protocols
54:11 we're not gonna hurt you I don't know
54:14 why you're beating us up so world's gone
54:17 to this whole phase and there's very few
54:18 pilgrims left and the ones that are left
54:20 are very constrained but they twist in
54:23 the story is that some of the robots
54:25 seem to be sentient to all the sudden
54:28 they're not evil at all they're just
54:32 seemingly having emotions and
54:34 participating in society a little bit
54:36 different than they have in the past
54:38 right Antonio Banderas bumps into the
54:42 problem and has to solve in order to
54:45 solve a claim against a robot doing
54:47 tits-up he bumps into the conspiracy and
54:53 you know there's definitely some
54:57 sentient things going on with these
54:59 robots and there's sort of a kingpin
55:02 robot that is the grand pooh-bah of all
55:05 this stuff which you'll discover in the
55:06 film this really doesn't hurt you at all
55:09 in the film you can really enjoy it
55:10 again in the last half gets really long
55:13 I think in the end the interesting thing
55:17 about this film
55:18 autumn is that the take away is very
55:21 interesting the intellectual kind of
55:23 Gestalt of the movie is very interesting
55:25 to take away and think about so for
55:27 those of you are sort of into the
55:28 cerebral sci-fi definitely get to the
55:31 end you will start to see what I'm
55:33 talking about here
55:35 but what if ok instead of being robots
55:39 it's us that we are technically what we
55:43 call organic robots because we're not
55:45 made of precious metals we're made of
55:47 organic mass and as I've always said on
55:50 this show and it actually came out as a
55:53 result of doing episodes on this show I
55:56 think everything that has life is
55:58 beautiful and I think it's been designed
56:00 very explicitly you know look at look at
56:04 the dragon mantis look at all these oh
56:07 there's a mantis that's red and black
56:08 that's one of the most amazing insects
56:10 I've ever seen in my life
56:12 but look at everything everything you've
56:14 ever admired a dog a cat a dolphin whale
56:18 right they're beautiful they're amazing
56:22 they're sweet sure they have to eat
56:25 things to survive so the hain it gets
56:26 kind of a bad rep but even the ugliest
56:29 fish with a venomous you know exterior
56:33 it's still beautiful even the ugliest
56:35 toad you know is still phenomenal
56:38 mechanism if you had to invent the toad
56:40 that carries its larva on its back you
56:43 know it's disgusting to look at it's
56:46 still an amazing invention spiders
56:48 spiders are freaky for a lot of people
56:51 snakes are freaky for a lot of people
56:52 but you mean to tell me you look at a
56:53 cobra and your jaw doesn't hit the
56:55 ground how amazing that thing is it's
56:57 got a black widow and go damn you know
57:00 it looks like an exotic car and they've
57:05 it seems as if something has been
57:06 experimenting well we got ones with
57:08 eight eyes we have these centipedes and
57:10 you know what we realized was you know
57:13 centipede can't really type that well on
57:15 a keyboard so we went ahead and made a
57:17 biped creature and and we're essentially
57:19 the latest model that's being incubated
57:21 in this reality the homo sapien sapien
57:25 we've been imbued with what would seem
57:27 to be the intellectual stem cells of
57:32 whatever creator created us the sense
57:35 that we are the sense that we can have
57:37 this show and that you can listen to me
57:39 and participate in a comment section on
57:40 a frickin youtube channel that's pretty
57:42 awesome right all you're all you're
57:45 doing right now is flooding yourself
57:47 with either the audio through your
57:49 computers which is this pattern of
57:51 electrons that have been stored in some
57:54 digital format so that you can hear my
57:55 voice but you can totally feel me man
57:58 right if you put the video on you get a
58:01 little bit more sensory input one of the
58:04 biggest questions that man has about
58:06 it's his existence is the purpose of our
58:08 existence
58:09 and it's always this sort of nebulous
58:12 thing you know I'm gonna make it an
58:17 episode that really goes into this and
58:19 deep but I'm not gonna reveal it here
58:20 just yet but if you were to say we had
58:24 some sort of captor or some creator or
58:27 creators that are participating in this
58:30 experiment and they're again more on the
58:33 lines of maybe a hundred thousand years
58:35 a million years ahead of us 30 million
58:38 years ahead of us
58:38 then what we see makes sense of course
58:41 if man could stop that Wolfman could get
58:45 rid of the oligarchy from the world and
58:46 the monarchy from the world all the
58:48 bankers are gone everything's gone and
58:50 we can figure out a loving way to
58:51 control world population SuperDuper
58:54 educate I mean every every sex ed class
58:58 is gone you can just learn about the
59:00 biology of the human mind you know we
59:04 don't we don't teach three-year-olds to
59:06 question their gender that kind of stuff
59:08 we get out of that stupid regiment that
59:10 we have today and go back to hardcore
59:12 sciences and art right we could get to a
59:16 point where we become amazing again you
59:21 know I think for Americans and again to
59:23 my to my listener that constantly
59:26 reminds me that Americans should pretty
59:28 much stick to America when they're
59:30 talking and I totally agree you know I
59:34 think I'm pretty good about not claiming
59:36 other regions of the world in any
59:38 massive detail and besides just some
59:40 broad strokes stuff but eventually we
59:44 would learn how to make everything
59:46 happen you know you know on this show
59:49 I'm a big proponent of etheral wins and
59:51 II throw particles and some people still
59:53 hang on to
59:54 farty physics that has an invented [ __ ]
59:57 you know they just invent more physics
60:00 they just invent more theory they don't
60:02 offend any inventions that you use to
60:03 make your household work right you know
60:06 think about think about these papers
60:08 that you read about scientists in
60:09 Cambridge or Oxford or MIT or Caltech
60:13 well you know a scientist is figuring
60:14 out we probably have at least thirty
60:15 three dimensions of reality it's like
60:17 okay now and my coffee still takes five
60:20 minutes to [ __ ] make here okay
60:22 so not terribly interested in what your
60:25 little circular logic you know thesis
60:29 said to get you a [ __ ] PhD in
60:32 something that doesn't help the world
60:34 you know Tesla one thing that's
60:37 interesting about Tesla he didn't run
60:40 around the world getting PhD after PhD
60:42 after PhD but he could have but he
60:44 didn't have any peers to give him a PhD
60:46 he don't he peers to read his thesis
60:49 right in fact if they did they would
60:52 have been horribly jealous of him just
60:54 like again Hitchhiker's Guide to the
60:55 galaxy the guy that was he created the
60:58 improbability Drive
61:00 he was lynched by his fellow scientists
61:03 who realized that the one thing they
61:05 hated more than anything was a smartass
61:06 someone who was smarter than them right
61:09 I will give credit to human beings to
61:11 create things that improved Society I
61:15 was sitting next to a gentleman at my
61:17 smoke shop this last week and very
61:20 open-minded guy mid-20s and one thing he
61:24 told me right from the very beginning
61:25 when I first met him was he was getting
61:27 into Pink Floyd and I said good because
61:30 if you do that your generation could
61:31 save this planet he goes man everyone's
61:33 getting back into the 70s and again I
61:35 will I will say that in America ok from
61:39 1975 to 1985 you have the absolute
61:42 golden era of artistic moment for this
61:45 country there's been a beautiful bunch
61:47 of Eros before that ok don't get me
61:49 wrong but in terms of film music art and
61:53 going to the next level this country has
61:55 never seen a better decade of time
61:58 that's the way the world should be going
62:01 in that direction we should be
62:05 experimenting with our consciousness
62:07 using under under scientific observation
62:11 under a protected scenario we should
62:15 drop acid we should we should be an
62:18 environment that is like literally like
62:20 a laser tag building where you could
62:22 have individuals that have done a
62:23 hundred trips or whatever they know what
62:26 you're going to be experiencing they put
62:27 you in a safe place
62:28 they psychologically evaluate you before
62:31 you take any and if you pass all the
62:33 tests maybe you don't have a bunch of
62:34 you know negative
62:35 in your in your closets that will eat
62:38 you alive once you reduce you know your
62:40 your barriers then you can take it but
62:43 if we raise kids properly in this world
62:45 and educated them properly and then kept
62:47 them away from violence and an oversexed
62:51 population and gender questioning and
62:53 all this other crap
62:54 maybe ready to take a trip whenever they
62:57 want to take a trip you know the
62:59 government gave this stuff to like
63:00 twelve year olds and fourteen year olds
63:02 back in the 60s and they survived
63:04 because they didn't have this horrific
63:06 life they had you know next and Leave It
63:09 to Beaver kind of life's right you know
63:13 Europe is trying to absorb a very small
63:19 sect of individuals from the Middle East
63:21 who are again 1500 years behind the rest
63:25 of society it's unbelievable you can't
63:30 do that you've got to educate you got to
63:32 fix their native worlds and educate them
63:34 up but we covet don't me we covet down
63:39 at our level knowledge if you've if any
63:43 of you've watched my screenwriting
63:44 episodes you will hear me say over and
63:47 over that one of the toughest things
63:49 that happens with screenwriting is
63:50 anyone who figures out how to do it
63:52 quickly and do it well they covet they
63:56 don't let anyone else know as if you
63:59 know the world would be a bad place and
64:01 the reason why Hollywood
64:02 I think sucks right now is that outside
64:05 of the entitled generation of executives
64:07 that run Hollywood but don't have any
64:09 film backgrounds but think they've seen
64:11 enough movies to be able to create a
64:12 good one they'll see you know we've seen
64:14 how that's working right now don't we
64:16 the writers don't want to research
64:18 writing it's interesting and through
64:22 nepotism or cronyism or what-have-you
64:25 they get the opportunity to write on
64:26 these movies you haven't seen a movie
64:28 that hasn't had probably unless it's
64:31 like a luc besson movie where you've got
64:33 a guy who's got enough money to hold
64:34 script to himself or even James Cameron
64:37 uses other writers okay but your average
64:40 movie that doesn't have someone like a
64:42 Spielberg on top of it I'm not sure his
64:45 regiment at all but it's been written by
64:47 30 writers
64:49 and it still sucks it still sucks you
64:53 know I asked people about Tron Legacy
64:55 all the time I said do you like Tron
64:57 Legacy and those oh yeah I was awesome
64:59 so what do you like about the movie
65:00 looked amazing yeah totally looked
65:02 amazing and the soundtrack by Daft Punk
65:04 was phenomenal yeah man totally I said
65:07 what do you remember about the story
65:08 well I don't really remember the story
65:09 that much it's cuz it sucked it was a
65:13 bad ripoff of the first franchise trying
65:15 to retell everything but destroying
65:17 everything that was wonderful about the
65:18 first movie 32 writers wrote that film
65:22 it was so poorly received that Disney
65:26 fired the director right after it was
65:27 over because he didn't want to take a
65:30 single class on how to write a movie he
65:32 still hasn't taken a single class on how
65:34 to write a movie as far as I understand
65:35 he's having a hard time surviving let's
65:38 not be that guy
65:39 let's get educated about everything that
65:41 we think matters in this world then the
65:47 world will become a wonderful place
65:48 right let's go back to the hundred-year
65:51 theory for one second to close up here
65:53 have any of you ever thought to yourself
65:56 by studying history that after you study
66:00 a segment of history especially when you
66:02 study it from a a technological
66:05 advancement cycle you're like wow at
66:08 this point we got this technology this
66:11 point we got that technology it seems to
66:13 come in odd bursts right why do we
66:18 remember people like Isaac Newton
66:21 Faraday Tesla because they debuted a new
66:27 set of technology that made the world a
66:29 better place by just simply
66:31 understanding it better again Einstein
66:34 not so much Oppenheimer not so much they
66:38 just wrote theoretical papers it's like
66:40 they were sitting in some sort of
66:41 mathematical philosophy to continue
66:43 going and continue going now you know
66:45 some of these inventions come out of
66:47 some of those theories but honestly when
66:49 you really track the technology you're
66:51 going back to Tesla almost every single
66:52 time and then the shoulders he stood on
66:54 which goes back to a Faraday who goes
66:56 back to other folks right
66:59 so if you've ever felt those cycles I
67:01 want you to think about the hundred-year
67:03 theory if you were the captor of a
67:07 society like ours you might think well
67:11 it's probably time we start releasing
67:14 this old technology to them and see what
67:16 they do you know we know our history
67:19 let's just say we are the hundred year
67:20 people that are way ahead of society we
67:23 know how we got to it let's see how they
67:25 get to it and they have a million means
67:28 of putting this out there they have
67:30 schools that don't mess around
67:33 you know Caltech I guarantee you doesn't
67:35 mess around the government gets most of
67:38 their big thinkers out of Caltech if you
67:41 start showing an amazing academic
67:43 attitude in school you get reported up
67:46 through the chain as being one of these
67:47 kids minces tries to harvest people that
67:50 can think for themselves and think more
67:52 logically than emotionally and we need a
67:55 motion as well but that's where you get
67:58 your artists your songwriters your
68:01 playwrights your you know television
68:04 shows your film shows when they're not I
68:07 mean we know that all these things today
68:09 are littered with social justice warrior
68:12 out [ __ ] story arcs and that kind of
68:14 stuff
68:15 but it's sort of like going to
68:16 Disneyland today and saying well I hate
68:18 Disneyland because corporations fund
68:21 everything and the corporate brands are
68:23 on everything it's like okay yeah I
68:24 understand but you know let me just tell
68:27 you one thing you finance a billion
68:29 dollar ride right now Disney is doing so
68:33 well they can actually do that when they
68:34 created Radiator Springs they didn't
68:36 need a bunch of sponsorship but they
68:38 could I mean you know if you say look we
68:41 built a 1.1 billion dollar extension to
68:43 the California Adventure Park called
68:45 Radiator Springs which they did and
68:47 someone's you know someone from Disney
68:50 goes look you know if we're willing to
68:51 put Toyota on the front of this thing we
68:54 can make 150 million dollars off the
68:57 initial investment give it back to our
68:59 bankers that we loan ourselves the money
69:01 from or whatever but a lot of us can go
69:04 to Disneyland or whatever Disney Park
69:07 that's out there and we can start seeing
69:09 Walt's DNA that's why I like Disneyland
69:10 like I always say Walt Disney
69:12 you ever went to Disneyland none of the
69:14 other parks were built before he died
69:16 right but we start to see the Imagineers
69:19 that also think like us and they they
69:21 keep the essence of wall alive okay
69:24 we'll take that and map it to society
69:27 there's no reason why this world
69:29 shouldn't be one of the most amazing
69:32 life's that we can live from the moment
69:34 were born to the moment we die at a
69:36 really nice old age due to the absolute
69:40 attrition of our bodies eating healthy
69:43 food exercising being happy the whole
69:46 time there's no cancer okay there's no
69:49 viruses or any anything that can kill us
69:51 the common cold would probably be the
69:53 only thing we'd have to kind of regulate
69:55 because it has to do with the
69:56 temperature change in pH balance and all
69:58 that kind of stuff in a world without
70:00 chemtrails and roll without all kinds of
70:01 other poisons but say we clear all that
70:03 out you should be able to live on this
70:07 planet from start to finish and the only
70:09 negative things that you come up with
70:11 are perhaps getting your heart broken
70:14 perhaps a random loss you know or like
70:16 nature a natural disaster occurs and you
70:19 lose a loved one or something like that
70:20 or you drive your car and correct but
70:22 even that we could probably fix cars to
70:24 never have accidents let me just think
70:26 about that no drunk driving deaths
70:29 anymore because you get in your car and
70:31 it drives you home you know obviously
70:32 people are trying to make that happen
70:33 right now it might not be a hundred
70:38 years but it's it's damn close I would
70:40 say for those of you who know Walt
70:43 Disney a specialist just keep using him
70:44 Tesla had his own visions of the future
70:46 as well but his were more cryptic and on
70:48 paper and then shrouded when the
70:50 government went and seized it all after
70:51 he passed away but while Disney created
70:53 you know Park Park rides which were sort
70:57 of you know the future of tomorrow sort
71:00 of park rides where they said look look
71:01 at your kitchen it was totally automated
71:03 look at your look at society he made
71:05 these these park rides which had you
71:10 know public tranquility controlled by
71:12 computers you didn't necessarily own
71:15 your own vehicle but if you did it was
71:17 more like a George Jetson where you got
71:19 in the car in the car used computers to
71:21 figure out where it could fly without
71:22 bumping and other folks well that was in
71:26 the
71:26 50s for God's sakes if you really go
71:28 back to Buck Rogers and a bunch of the
71:31 HG Wells work we've had schematics on
71:35 paper for ever go back to da Vinci he
71:38 had schematics on paper that said man
71:40 should have the ability to fly but it's
71:43 always abandoned now we know that if the
71:47 average human being could fly their own
71:49 car and drive wherever they wanted to
71:51 drive there'd be all kinds of air
71:52 collisions and that kind of stuff so we
71:54 can't just make this stuff by itself
71:56 we've got to introduce other artificial
71:57 intelligence to make sure that you can
72:00 drive like they did in Blade Runner or
72:03 Fifth Element
72:04 or you know this the Star Wars prequels
72:07 where you can fly your ship in a big
72:09 city full of vehicles you never hit
72:10 anybody because it's impossible the
72:12 computers will make sure that you you
72:14 have a safe path right so what I'm
72:18 getting at is this one don't covet if
72:23 you figured out how to do something you
72:25 teach everybody who wants to know
72:26 don't push it on anybody who doesn't
72:28 want to know and again if you want to
72:30 trick your kids into stuff know what I
72:33 found is you don't go to your child and
72:36 say hey would you like to learn how to
72:37 draw would you like to learn how to
72:38 paint what you do is you fill the house
72:40 full of all this equipment you use it in
72:43 front of your child showing them the
72:44 benefit of it they can look over your
72:46 shoulder and see how you do it let them
72:47 ask the questions let them feel like
72:50 they've stolen a pencil and a protractor
72:54 or whatever in the paper and they've hid
72:56 it in their room and they're drawing
72:57 stuff on their own it's all a big secret
72:59 right you'd let them own it but you
73:02 you've pro actually kind of tricked them
73:03 into it you know I've raised my own
73:07 daughter and I've raised children of
73:09 girlfriends that I've had for you know a
73:12 couple years at a time and I tell you I
73:14 just when I finally figured out the
73:16 algorithm I just started buying supplies
73:18 and just giving it to them and just
73:20 saying well there it is there's like
73:21 four hundred markers of different colors
73:24 here's a bunch of different paper here's
73:25 a book that's bound that just as blank
73:27 sheets and fill it up do what you want
73:29 and then they I would draw around them
73:32 and they would start watching me and you
73:33 know we'd start getting into it so I
73:37 think you feel me
73:38 the hundred-year theory and let me give
73:43 me give you sort of a way to view this
73:45 moving forward real quickly there's
73:48 something called the ten monkey
73:49 experiment but I believe it was actually
73:51 done with a hundred monkeys and it was
73:53 this experiment that proved that we
73:56 communicate without verbal communication
73:58 because a monkey doesn't have an
73:59 articulated palate inside the skull they
74:02 cannot talk like we talk they can only
74:04 howl because they have sort of a hominid
74:08 chamber behind the nasal cavity right so
74:10 they're unable to move their tongue like
74:12 we move our tongue but they took a
74:15 monkey out of a sort of an agronomic in
74:20 I believe the real number was a hundred
74:22 and they pulled one inside of the neck
74:24 into a laboratory and he was then
74:27 alienated from his tribe and they they
74:30 gave him a little machine he had to
74:32 learn how to do to get a pellet of food
74:33 out and as soon as he got the pellet of
74:34 food out they put him back in population
74:38 and the way the story goes is that it
74:40 took about two weeks to do and I
74:42 probably all the numbers were skewed
74:43 because the story has been told so many
74:45 times but overall it took an extended
74:47 period of time for this monkey to learn
74:49 how to do this I've even heard it one of
74:54 the experiments was untying a knot but
74:57 anyway once it learned it went back into
74:59 the tribe they let it sit for one week
75:01 when they pulled in another monkey from
75:03 a completely different sect of monkeys
75:06 that weren't really hanging out with the
75:07 other group and they pulled him in and
75:09 gave him the experiment and he solved it
75:10 in half the time
75:12 now because they can observe all these
75:15 monkeys inside this chamber they
75:16 realized that there was no real physical
75:18 contact other monkey didn't come and go
75:19 this is what's gonna happen they're
75:21 gonna put you in this thing this is how
75:22 to do this but through mental
75:23 communication they realized that there's
75:25 essentially a hive mind in primates by
75:32 the tenth monkey it knew exactly how to
75:35 do it they went in and just went pop pop
75:37 pop and had never been there before
75:39 so we call it the ten monkey experiment
75:42 but it was actually a hundred monkeys
75:43 I'm calling it a hundred year theory but
75:46 it could be any number of years ahead of
75:49 us I would say a hundred is good
75:52 20 is more sort of a layman's
75:55 understanding I'm not talking about the
75:57 military-industrial complex being a 20
76:00 years ahead I'm talking about something
76:01 way above that that's at least a hundred
76:04 years out but again I want you to look
76:07 at the value of history when you know
76:08 all history you become extremely
76:10 powerful about what works and what
76:13 doesn't work because what is history
76:15 history is a gigantic matrix of cause
76:18 and effect models and if you don't have
76:22 that knowledge of how societies behave
76:24 you know your average social justice
76:26 warrior thinks this socialism is in
76:30 fascism how funny is that right and Tifa
76:34 aunty fascism is a fascist organization
76:39 that wants fascism to take over the
76:41 world
76:41 but they've been so duped because they
76:43 are so ignorant and so young and so
76:45 impressionable and they have been raised
76:48 in a world where boom and bust cycles
76:50 destroy all of their prospects there's
76:51 not a lot of great jobs so they're
76:53 pouring coffee that's about to change in
76:55 America it is okay once they get
77:00 educated as to how ignorant they were
77:02 there's gonna be anti anti fast people
77:06 write this like man I was duped you know
77:08 it's it's the antifa thing is as close
77:13 to the white people yelling at black
77:16 people when segregation was coming
77:19 undone when desegregation started taking
77:21 over those white people that yelled at
77:24 the black students that were coming into
77:25 the white schools
77:26 that's your auntie foe people right
77:28 super duper ignorant about cause and
77:30 effect models of history understand
77:33 understand integration was one of the
77:35 coolest things we could ever do you know
77:37 a nice pace right you know we were
77:40 hundreds of years behind that
77:42 integration when we eventually did it in
77:45 the 60s and actually passed laws against
77:47 it against segregation and I'm gonna
77:50 close on this one statement not to read
77:52 out the bumper I do believe that the 15
77:58 year olds and younger are going to be a
78:02 wonderful generation for the
78:04 country of America I do not know what's
78:06 going on in Europe or any other place in
78:08 the world but I'll tell you in America
78:09 again I've said this several times
78:11 you've got kids
78:13 getting into science and actually doing
78:16 things with their knowledge they're
78:17 building robots they're they're
78:19 shredding guitars they're bringing back
78:22 dance how many times have you seen these
78:24 breakdance videos now I'm watching
78:26 breakdance videos of South Korean
78:30 auditoriums full of you know two or
78:32 three thousand people and the South
78:35 Korean kids are out there just
78:35 breakdance and better than anyone I've
78:37 ever seen it's all over America again
78:39 it's it's something we invented in the
78:42 80s to say look let's stop gang violence
78:44 let's just Duke it out through fighting
78:46 and it's artistic it's fun and nobody
78:49 has any bad memories of it right I don't
78:50 remember any drive-bys how to breakdance
78:52 rally when I was a kid you know I used
78:56 to make a hundred bucks a week that's
78:58 the kid doing that dancin professionally
79:01 at stores it's old you know that the
79:07 music and the clothing and all that kind
79:08 of stuff it was awesome it was a
79:11 negative I came out of a world of
79:12 fighting to school and fighting home
79:14 from school to back to my hometown and
79:17 and we were inside its envelope of art
79:20 and it was the other thing too is we
79:22 used to spray-paint walls and we made
79:26 art I mean it was beautiful like I found
79:28 this old pipe once and on this wall and
79:33 it's just a it's just like a like a
79:36 normal pipe that you know you just turn
79:38 the knob you put a hose on it and you
79:40 can do whatever you want to do in this
79:41 alleyway and I painted we painted the
79:44 wall really red and then we blew out the
79:47 bricks really cool which weren't
79:48 proportional to the bricks the wall was
79:50 actually made out of but then I painted
79:52 really beautiful cartoony water spilling
79:57 out of this pipe and it was like all
79:59 over the ground and it was all really
80:01 cool and I you know I shined up all the
80:03 beads of water to have like a little
80:06 little highlight on them it was really
80:07 cool we took something that was ugly and
80:10 made it beautiful again it's just a
80:14 choice man it's just a choice to get out
80:16 of the mundane and get into something
80:17 creative
80:20 so I think that if if we have any
80:24 creator whether it be God or some sub
80:27 creature that is like maybe even a grey
80:30 alien or there's special humans on the
80:33 other side of this dome or whatever
80:34 they're looking for us to become
80:36 interesting as I've said on the show
80:38 several times I don't think we've been
80:40 created to be trivial human beings they
80:43 don't need to see that again
80:44 right husband wife two kids the nucleus
80:48 family and everyone lives a boring
80:49 [ __ ] life and then you die hmm
80:52 maybe maybe they want to look at you
80:54 know some of your small talk
80:55 conversations maybe some of your
80:57 Christmases but at some point you've got
80:59 to do something that's interesting and
81:01 every single person who can hear my
81:04 voice has that inside them I think most
81:08 of you have an inkling of what it is if
81:10 you haven't completely done it you some
81:12 of you have careers in exactly what you
81:14 want to do in life but the only way
81:16 you're gonna get there is to educate
81:18 yourself right to eclipse this advantage
81:21 that might be out there this hundred
81:23 year advantage that someone might have
81:24 over you you'll never see a child more
81:29 elated in a long-term manner than when
81:32 they learn how to do something for
81:34 themselves right you can give a kid an
81:37 iPhone it's good for a little while then
81:40 they get tired you give them PlayStation
81:42 4 and then they're really happy for a
81:44 little while but eventually mm-hmm you
81:47 didn't really imbue their soul with
81:48 anything but then the second they figure
81:50 out how to draw or paint or write a
81:52 story or dance or play a guitar or
81:55 whatever sing now you're talking now you
81:58 start to see obsession in a beautiful
82:01 way you would never turn down your kid
82:03 from the mom and dad I got to practice
82:05 my guitar for four hours in the bedroom
82:07 you know you're an [ __ ] parent if you
82:10 if you stop them from doing that right
82:12 encourage them what else do you need son
82:14 what else do I need daughter you need a
82:16 new wah-wah pedal we'll go get it's 35
82:19 bucks I'll work two jobs so you can have
82:21 that you know you know I know a lot of
82:25 rockers in this world and I will tell
82:26 you
82:28 you never seen them more happy in their
82:30 life when they're on stage holding
82:32 whatever instrument they do whether it
82:34 be a microphone or bass guitar or drums
82:35 set or whatever they are in a level of
82:39 heaven that a lot of us sadly don't know
82:41 unless you've done it right I've been
82:44 very privileged to do a lot of those
82:46 things and I will tell you that it's
82:48 it's so liberating in it and it also
82:51 gives you the confidence in your being
82:53 to do anything else in life right why do
82:57 you think that you know actors and
82:58 musicians are kind of arrogant people
83:01 well some of them are arrogant jerks and
83:03 some of them are just confident and
83:05 they're being misunderstood or they're
83:06 being hated on because they have more
83:08 confidence than the person who's hating
83:09 them anyway hope you feel me if you
83:15 haven't gone too deep thoughts radio.com
83:17 you should probably go there and make
83:19 sure you have the feed that is
83:21 appropriate for you we are now down
83:23 again to YouTube for all video vid me
83:26 went out of business I am posting the
83:29 first season very slowly inside of the
83:32 locked Facebook group which you can get
83:33 to from the website you do have to ask
83:35 permission to be in there if you have a
83:37 very recent Facebook account you need to
83:39 give me a sentence why you think you
83:41 want to be a part of the group because
83:42 then you look like a bot if you come in
83:44 I just had one this morning who
83:45 registered and joined today and then had
83:48 some crazy name and wanted to join the
83:51 group and I don't know what I'm in I
83:52 don't want you guys dealing with that
83:54 crap we don't need BOTS spying on your
83:57 your use patterns right if you want
84:00 audio inside your car or when you're
84:02 jogging or out messing around there are
84:04 two options iTunes and Google Play
84:06 so whatever device you have it'll work
84:08 beautifully but if you just have a
84:10 mobile device that you're using just go
84:12 to the website click on the RSS feed it
84:14 will attach to your podcast reader and
84:16 you'll be cooking with gas
84:18 I've also got a few of you on patreon
84:21 which is really cool our subscriptions
84:23 have just set there and hovered at like
84:25 eighteen hundred and eighty I mean
84:27 forever
84:27 it's amazing we're not growing any more
84:29 on the You Tube channel
84:31 so either I'm not producing the videos
84:33 or we're getting ganked or both so
84:36 whatever if any of you think that there
84:38 should be a lot of subscribers to this
84:40 channel
84:40 the only way you're gonna get it to
84:41 happen is to share the crap out of this
84:43 thing
84:43 I do think we benefit from you know
84:48 increasing the numbers simply because we
84:50 start to spread this information to
84:52 folks the episodes that you think are
84:54 valuable you know Sharon episode if
84:56 you're going to share one with a friend
84:57 or share one on your page or something
84:58 like that I would say try to find one
85:02 that would grip everyone regardless of
85:05 their travels regardless of their
85:06 conspiracy theory background or whatever
85:08 and let them find the other ones that
85:10 are more controversial and skip them
85:11 because if you post up a really hardcore
85:13 one they may go why did you post this
85:16 frickin weirdo in his backyard but
85:19 anyway I appreciate you guys take care
85:21 of yourself and someone else and I'll
85:22 see you in the next deep thoughts over
85:24 now
