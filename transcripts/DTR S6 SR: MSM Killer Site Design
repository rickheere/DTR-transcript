00:14 so
00:19 [Music]
00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts radio
00:36 ladies and gentlemen
00:38 it's kind of a weird day so i'm i'm in
00:40 my weird location again
00:41 it's a little windy rained a lot
00:43 yesterday
00:44 and so now it's a gorgeous real clouds
00:48 with tones of gray in them because
00:49 they're not made of aluminum dust
00:51 it's actually quite quite midwestern
00:53 today
00:54 so the next episode you're going to see
00:55 is going to be about jack parsons
00:57 laboratory
00:58 otherwise known as jpl
01:02 and if you think it goes by a different
01:03 name then stick around for that next
01:05 episode
01:07 but this one is about something that
01:10 we've all felt
01:12 but i think that we haven't actually
01:13 thought it through properly
01:16 to make it take effect
01:20 here we are sitting on top of an amazing
01:22 invention
01:23 called the internet the internet was
01:27 really created in the early 60s it was
01:30 formally handed over to the institutions
01:32 of the world in
01:33 what 69 which is why there's this
01:36 big date around 1969 that we all used
01:39 inside the computer programming part of
01:41 day capturing what have you but they
01:44 prophesied that this would happen and it
01:46 does
01:47 it did happen excuse me it does exist
01:50 now but what we have done is we have
01:54 allowed these old institutions
01:57 who normally report on what's going on
01:59 in the world
02:00 to continue to exist when they were only
02:04 created because we didn't have the
02:05 internet
02:07 now some people who are very very asleep
02:11 they might say but you know there's
02:13 journalism and there's rules and all
02:15 this other stuff
02:16 you need to refer them over to project
02:18 mockingbird
02:20 we're all press has been purchased
02:24 100 percent around the world
02:28 you get your feed or they get their feed
02:30 from
02:31 reuters or ap same organization by the
02:33 way
02:35 reuters founded by the rothschilds in
02:36 the 1850s
02:38 reuters bought ap i think in 2004.
02:42 so it's all one group
02:45 hedge fund managers in wall street have
02:47 reuters
02:48 you know news machines terminals that
02:52 give them the data
02:53 the second it comes in
02:56 telling them what reality is if a bomb
02:59 goes off
03:00 they tell you who set that bomb off and
03:03 what we are supposed
03:04 to do as a result of that action
03:07 a bias a subjective bias constantly
03:10 introduced
03:11 to all things that either really
03:13 occurred or didn't occur or might have
03:15 occurred a little bit and are being spun
03:16 a particular way
03:19 our first goal in this game
03:23 is to defund them by never ever ever
03:26 visiting them again
03:30 not through a television set not through
03:31 a telephone app
03:33 and not through your computer browsers
03:36 never ever touch the domains i mean i'm
03:40 i'm pretty disciplined but i don't
03:43 uh have people in my house that want to
03:45 see that stuff
03:47 but taking the the router to your home
03:51 and getting in there maybe not the one
03:53 you got from the phone company but
03:55 daisy chain one in there that you can
03:57 keep programmed all the time so if they
03:58 have to replace your modem you don't
04:00 lose all your work
04:01 but block all the domains block them
04:04 entirely
04:06 it'll have a hell of effect on your
04:07 phone it'll be amazing
04:09 we have to completely and utterly defund
04:11 them
04:12 by never visiting them again
04:16 if you're so inclined maybe even say uh
04:21 write their biggest advertisers organize
04:24 a campaign
04:25 and say look if your ads show up on this
04:27 platform
04:28 ever again we're not going to have
04:30 anything to do with you
04:32 but i'll tell you what i will do if your
04:34 ad shows up
04:35 on gab minds.com whatever
04:39 totally love you but you can't do both
04:41 take your pick
04:43 no you technically would have to have
04:45 someone go in there to look
04:47 we have to cut them off then we also
04:50 have to keep up with
04:52 making sure that anyone who brings you
04:53 information from those resources
04:55 are also notified that you won't be
04:57 accepting that information
04:58 from them if that's where it's coming
05:00 from
05:02 unless you cut them off you say i'm just
05:04 going to have to block your phone
05:06 to block your text messages i'm going to
05:08 have to unfriend your account block your
05:09 account if you ever
05:10 cut and paste this trash to me
05:14 now if you wanna take a screenshot
05:15 because someone reported something wrong
05:17 or incorrect it's some
05:19 wild hey the inauguration went out in
05:22 europe uh what is it seven to eight
05:23 hours before it actually happened here
05:24 in the united states
05:25 sure whatever but don't send me the
05:28 domain
05:29 not giving them any money not giving
05:30 them any traffic
05:32 so what's the alternative we've already
05:35 been told
05:36 the alternative tagline which is you are
05:38 the news
05:40 now that doesn't necessarily solve any
05:42 of the previous problems
05:44 but let me give you a
05:48 an invention idea i had which i will not
05:50 be executing so
05:51 feel free there's something called yelp
05:55 yelp is where a restaurant gets
05:58 reviewed all the
06:02 employees can go up and put five stars
06:03 all the best friends and family members
06:05 can go put five stars
06:07 so they can easily get their restaurant
06:10 rated really high
06:13 my idea was to use a friends and family
06:16 technique
06:18 where you have a yelp but you only hear
06:21 the reviews from people that you trust
06:23 and people that you know have similar
06:25 palettes
06:25 than you do that you do excuse me
06:29 why do that well it cuts out all the
06:32 chai con
06:33 artificial reviews that happen in the
06:36 apple store
06:37 or the android store or yelp
06:40 you can just pay them to put a bunch of
06:41 crap on your
06:43 on your product and stream steam excuse
06:46 me
06:48 so it cuts it down so imagine that we
06:52 had a news
06:53 network created by the people for the
06:56 people
06:57 using some sort of blockchain blockchain
06:59 platform which could be gab could be
07:01 mines could be
07:02 i don't know if 107 daily.com one will
07:05 survive but two
07:07 if it's blockchain or not blockchain is
07:09 the best way to go
07:10 gab i believe is already set up and
07:12 mines is definitely set up that way
07:14 so we use these platforms so we don't
07:16 have to build our own array
07:19 plus it brings them business and we
07:22 form a network of people that we know
07:25 just like linkedin does
07:27 to say here comes a piece of information
07:32 every time a piece of information comes
07:34 in there's a degree of which
07:36 establishes how far you are away from
07:38 the source reporting that particular
07:41 piece of news so you and i are buddies
07:45 i mean we are acquaintances at minimum
07:47 we met each other face to face
07:50 you can look back at five and a half
07:51 years of what i've been doing determine
07:52 whether or not you trust me or not
07:55 but you mark me down as a link so we're
07:57 linked together we're one degree from
07:58 each other
08:00 then we give each other a star rating if
08:03 i've never had any information from you
08:04 but you've had a lot from me
08:05 maybe i don't give you a star rating
08:08 just yet it just says undecided
08:10 because you're not a reporter yet
08:13 for me you give me some some rating
08:15 between one to ten
08:17 so now i report some news to you
08:22 you judge that piece of news whether or
08:24 not it was true or false
08:26 you have maybe a slider or a plus or a
08:29 minus
08:32 to determine whether i have reported
08:34 something true or false
08:36 now let's say you have a brother-in-law
08:40 who also wants some information doesn't
08:42 have any resources yet
08:43 he's one degree from you and i'm one
08:46 degree from you
08:47 so i'm two degrees from him this is all
08:49 level two stuff from
08:51 linkedin.com each degree you're away
08:54 that
08:55 tells you it's like kevin bacon man
08:59 now your brother-in-law could subscribe
09:02 to me
09:03 with the qualification that you are
09:05 trustworthy
09:06 and you trust me for the time being
09:09 i could get hit on the head do some
09:13 peyote or something and really start
09:14 misleading you guys and the second i do
09:16 that
09:17 my rating goes down you decouple from me
09:20 and i go into a probationary period
09:24 until i can explain what the hell i was
09:25 doing when i was misleading you
09:29 that's the system that needs to be
09:30 created we really need to do this we
09:33 really need to get
09:34 organized we also could probably take
09:37 those platforms and create
09:40 a submission form which has the anatomy
09:43 of what we want in a piece of news
09:46 date time of day
09:49 geographical location headline
09:53 description tags both tags of
09:56 individuals
09:57 like hey tom hanks had something weird
09:59 happen to him at the airport so
10:01 oh instagram tom hanks hashtag tom hinks
10:05 then you might have like touching kids i
10:08 don't know some i'm just throwing them
10:10 out there
10:10 don't want to mix anything together you
10:13 know but
10:15 then that database becomes harvested now
10:18 here's the thing
10:18 you might think yeah yeah that's all
10:20 great dude but
10:22 the bad guys are gonna put together fake
10:24 networks
10:26 liars that are all attached to liars
10:30 here's how we take care of some of that
10:34 so let's just say we build our own
10:36 little personal network and it starts to
10:38 get to about 100
10:39 000 people globally our relatives are
10:42 friends that we trust
10:43 right people we went to school with
10:45 people went to war with
10:47 our daughters our brothers our sisters
10:49 our mothers are fathers
10:50 it's a pretty strong network high
10:52 integrity rating
10:55 i think that it would be best to somehow
10:58 have family
10:59 connections be over uh prioritized could
11:02 be prioritized more than friends
11:04 versus acquaintances i think that was
11:06 all important hey i met a guy at cigar
11:08 lounge
11:09 seem to be pretty informed i'm joining
11:11 his network
11:12 he's an acquaintance i'm putting this
11:15 out there because no one should
11:18 i don't know i just think that this is
11:20 so important that we can't
11:22 hoard this sort of stuff this hasn't
11:24 been made
11:25 this will change the world trust me pass
11:28 this video around
11:29 let's get some people investing in this
11:33 let's see the bad guys come in a scumbag
11:36 by the name of george soros comes in
11:38 this whole thing and pays a corporation
11:40 creates a corporation to create a bunch
11:41 of fake family connections a bunch of
11:43 fake connections with fake news and all
11:45 sorts of stuff
11:47 now they're going to prime the pump with
11:49 a breaking story that only they have the
11:51 facts on
11:52 a bit like that twilight zone with
11:55 burgess meredith
11:56 playing the the devil who not only
12:01 is the best typesmith and reporter but
12:03 he's also a guy that conjures
12:05 [Music]
12:07 events to occur of which he then reports
12:09 on and he's got the scoop
12:12 i think the second story he reported on
12:14 was the competition's paper burning to
12:16 the ground
12:17 of which he also instigated so there'll
12:19 be some really
12:20 tantalizing stories they'll blow up a
12:23 bomb
12:24 in some place they'll do something and
12:26 they're going to be the only ones that
12:27 have the drop on the information because
12:28 they orchestrated it
12:31 here's how we insulate ourselves against
12:34 this
12:36 and there's always going to be an
12:37 attempt to mess around
12:39 but if we do this right even artificial
12:42 intelligence could be easily written
12:44 to clean the swamp out of the system
12:47 if we have a human to human connection
12:52 situation where someone has to
12:55 physically
12:57 know someone else before the line ever
13:00 gets validated
13:02 so soros is trying to do his stuff from
13:04 the backstabbing folks
13:06 around the world well they're never
13:09 going to get to you
13:10 personally no one's ever walking into
13:12 your business
13:14 into your picnic and ever saying hi
13:17 because they couldn't possibly do that
13:20 there's too many of us and not enough of
13:22 them
13:23 so they put all this effort into their
13:25 network and no one cares
13:27 no one's listening only they are
13:29 listening you can't even see their feed
13:32 because you haven't signed up to it
13:34 there's no way for you to see
13:35 a promoted feed by gab
13:39 right or bit shoot or whatever there's
13:41 no suggestions if you didn't sign up to
13:43 see it
13:43 you don't see it you don't even see it
13:46 when you say i want to see all the tags
13:48 on
13:49 you know disneyland or something and
13:51 they've got disneyland articles
13:53 you won't see their articles you cannot
13:55 be misled because you haven't signed up
13:57 to be misled
13:58 nothing is coming at you unless you ask
14:00 it to come at you
14:02 but now there's different levels of
14:04 reporting the news
14:06 so let's say that's pretty tight
14:09 and the other one i would like to
14:10 suggest is that if you establish a
14:12 friendship with somebody
14:14 through this network meaning i know you
14:16 personally
14:18 if virtually we've been talking over
14:20 skype for two years or whatever or
14:22 zoom then
14:25 i put into the platform i know dave
14:29 dave is my moderator he and i have been
14:31 chatting for years
14:33 and i tell the system i know dave for
14:36 x number of years dave gets a
14:38 notification
14:40 and he says yeah that's actually true i
14:42 validate
14:43 his claim that he knows me that allows
14:47 me to connect with dave
14:48 he has to agree to that level of
14:50 connection
14:52 at that point the system starts to
14:53 maintain our relationship and our
14:56 connection
14:56 based on how much i visit his feed and
14:59 how much he visits mine
15:01 or if he's just the provider of data say
15:03 from canada
15:04 and i'm a provider of data from america
15:06 then there's a reason we go back and
15:08 forth but it could be that i don't do
15:09 anything and he does it all
15:10 and then i'm a spectator
15:14 if there's any ever any interaction
15:16 between us
15:16 [Music]
15:18 it keeps that in the system it
15:20 understands
15:24 sorry if there's a little bit of wind in
15:26 the mic shouldn't be terribly bad
15:29 but we know that there's journalism of
15:30 different levels there's reporting
15:34 an immediate event you're downtown
15:36 there's been a
15:38 fire and you're just happen to be
15:40 standing in a nightclub across the
15:41 street and you want to report the fact
15:43 that this fire is going on you've taken
15:46 pictures you're taking videos
15:49 our platform could simply be asking
15:52 a simple list of content that you have
15:54 to provide to get your story at a
15:56 minimum
15:57 date location which you can just gps
16:01 right off your phone
16:03 subject and description whether it's
16:06 emergency or not
16:07 maybe even just like the species of news
16:09 it's tech news it's
16:11 it's uh current affairs it's a an alert
16:16 so that's the base level of reporting
16:20 that we would like to have right a great
16:22 foundation across the world
16:25 every single region needs to be
16:26 validated by its people
16:29 so say dave signs up to me and i'm
16:32 reporting something in the area
16:34 if it's a big enough event then there
16:36 should be other people on the platform
16:37 reporting and confirming
16:39 providing other data at this point
16:42 there's an automatic checks and balances
16:44 to see if there's dis info in the system
16:46 because people could be
16:47 submitting bad photographs bad videos
16:50 and the minute someone misleads someone
16:53 they're totally neutralized forever
16:56 and boy let me tell you there's so many
16:58 techniques they're reverse engineering
16:59 their ip address to location
17:02 they'd have to in pretty strong
17:05 and there's ways of checking whether or
17:07 not they're using a vpn you can just
17:09 decide whether or not the information is
17:11 being submitted in the quality
17:13 technique so let everybody submit but
17:16 imagine you say this information was
17:18 submitted under a vpn
17:21 so it just immediately anything that
17:23 sounds and feels suspicious
17:25 it's already suspicious someone from
17:27 china reported what happened in colorado
17:30 not likely right they can't physically
17:32 be in china and tell me that they were
17:34 on the ground in china
17:35 all that stuff could be easily coded
17:37 they could try to spoof ip addresses
17:40 but if you gps net finding out where
17:43 that ip address is coming from
17:45 generally if it's not in the vicinity
17:47 yelp
17:49 yelp won't let you write a review for a
17:50 restaurant or check into a restaurant
17:52 i should say sorry i won't let you check
17:54 into a restaurant unless your ipa
17:56 address is physically near
17:58 the restaurant now i'm going to be
18:01 passing this video around myself to
18:03 individuals who i know
18:05 will be interested in this and building
18:06 this but if this is built 10 different
18:08 ways to sunday
18:10 it's not a bad thing may the best man
18:11 win mankind man
18:15 but what other type of reporting do we
18:16 have to maintain
18:19 now it used to be that we didn't have
18:22 instantaneous current news on the ground
18:26 so we weren't associated all the time as
18:28 we are today
18:31 what did that create well it created
18:36 the platform for writing articles
18:39 because people are bored of death give
18:41 me the newspaper
18:42 let's sit around now you don't need a
18:43 newspaper anymore you don't need an
18:45 article anymore
18:47 articles might simply be a pass a thing
18:50 that baby boomers like
18:52 maybe maybe a gen xer likes but i don't
18:54 think anyone reads an article more than
18:56 a couple paragraphs before they're out
18:59 one i think the quality of articles that
19:00 we have access to today is
19:02 actually pretty bad but let's say we
19:06 want to convert
19:07 a kid in india to be a great journalist
19:12 to write an article now i know people go
19:15 off and get degrees in journalism
19:19 what is journalism at its most
19:21 fundamental
19:22 state you are going to now
19:26 do research into something you're going
19:27 to get an in-depth
19:29 view on a particular subject you need to
19:31 break things down
19:33 it's sort of like writing your thesis in
19:35 college you're going to have to pitch to
19:37 the thesis professors
19:38 what it is you're going to do your
19:39 thesis on they're going to find out if
19:41 it's
19:42 boring if it's original if it has
19:45 actually any
19:45 value after you write it whether or not
19:48 it's complex enough to really test
19:51 the discipline that you're talking about
19:53 right so if you're some chemist
19:55 and you're i'm gonna do a thing on if
19:57 there's water wet you know and they're
19:59 gonna go
20:00 i don't think so well it's either that
20:02 or i'm gonna create a new
20:03 rocket fuel that can operate in a
20:05 complete vacuum oh no that's interesting
20:07 go for it you know
20:10 i helped create some software once that
20:13 helps you do your taxes
20:15 and before i left the company
20:18 i had come up with a
20:21 thing that was our version of what you
20:24 would have in dos applications which is
20:26 instead of filling out these tax forms i
20:29 asked you very simple questions about
20:30 your income
20:32 based off a bunch of cpa questions and
20:34 then would filter that into the forms
20:36 which is exactly the way it works online
20:37 now
20:38 and everyone's done it probably 10 20
20:40 times before
20:42 same thing we can do for a journalistic
20:44 interface
20:45 it's just to get out of their individual
20:48 and teach them by design as they answer
20:50 the questions on the website
20:52 what is it you're reporting if you're
20:54 going to do a journalistic article
20:56 what is it you're reporting who are your
20:58 sources
21:01 the bibliography of what they write is
21:02 automatically harvested directly below
21:05 if they wrote a paragraph about
21:06 something to the side there's a little
21:09 meta field that goes i got this
21:11 information from this source
21:14 now the interesting thing is is that if
21:16 we have a bunch of validated
21:18 eyewitness news that's being reported
21:21 constantly
21:23 if we have this network of people that
21:26 are already validated with eyewitness
21:28 news imagine
21:31 being able to cross link your sources
21:34 within your own article to say right
21:37 here is where i got that source
21:39 and then we go through our blockchain
21:40 news network over to
21:42 that source and we can
21:46 validate it ourselves plus using basic
21:49 mathematics on the star ratings of
21:51 all the people that this individual
21:52 might have referenced to build their
21:54 article
21:55 plus their own reference for anything
21:56 that isn't cited in the references
21:59 we could say this article has about an
22:01 eight and a half
22:02 star rating without you even reading it
22:06 integrity by design cutting those
22:09 artificial networks off the map we no
22:12 longer need personality news
22:17 but the number one thing we have to do
22:20 is disconnect ourselves from this
22:23 dependency that we have built up over
22:25 decades depending on how old you are
22:28 so can you imagine when the official
22:32 sources report their thing because
22:33 they're going to try to fight it out
22:34 right but they're going to be going
22:35 bankrupt left and right
22:37 but they start reporting stuff and then
22:39 our network is already established
22:41 and validated and we can immediately
22:44 start
22:45 destroying their artificial narratives
22:49 i think this could be utterly massive
22:52 now could you imagine that they pull an
22:54 event because
22:56 one thing that's going to start
22:57 happening during this current
22:58 administration if someone doesn't nut up
23:00 and
23:00 change things in america we're going to
23:02 go back to those
23:04 um how do i use it without kicking off
23:06 keywords
23:08 where they're bad thing actors
23:12 that are everywhere and they're going to
23:15 be
23:15 wholesale eliminating human beings
23:20 trying to take away your devices that
23:22 can protect you
23:24 using ammunition
23:27 there you go because we don't have this
23:31 in our pocket because we don't have this
23:33 platform to easily report things in a
23:35 structured
23:36 manner with any level of integrity
23:38 because we do not have this friends and
23:39 family network rating system
23:42 and this validation system say i think
23:44 i've told the system i know you for five
23:46 years
23:47 thus increasing the integrity of force
23:50 between the two of us
23:52 you realize that the bad guys could
23:53 build a full network full of fake
23:55 individuals with all this self-validated
23:57 stuff
23:59 but again if someone says they're from
24:00 toledo ohio and they're using
24:02 a vpn from china the system
24:04 automatically detects that
24:06 over the course of several uses of the
24:08 account because vpns
24:10 struggle to give you the same location
24:12 every single time we can sniff them out
24:13 and get rid of them
24:15 so you have someone who is like a ditz
24:18 in your family
24:19 and goes okay i love this person i'd
24:21 never met him before but i totally like
24:23 them 10 stars and blah blah
24:25 as soon as that person gets
24:30 marginalized in terms of yeah that's the
24:32 idiot and i've got in my family or the
24:34 dumb uncle i've got in my family
24:36 and they went off and signed up to
24:38 george soros's network
24:39 thus creating this little connection
24:41 between the two of us
24:44 then we automatically deprecate their
24:46 ability to create a connection
24:48 that you're going to trust and it could
24:50 be right out that if i friend you
24:53 and you're like okay i trust mark to
24:55 find other sources
24:57 that would be very validated because he
24:59 talks on a regular basis and i can hear
25:00 his thoughts
25:01 hasn't misled me yet intentionally at
25:03 least
25:04 and so you trust more so you still
25:07 it's not automatic but you're more
25:09 willing to trust
25:11 the new one that's coming up and see
25:13 this whole invention needs to happen on
25:14 every single platform it can't be under
25:16 one platform
25:17 such that they d platform that one
25:19 platform that takes this idea
25:21 then we're back to square one everyone
25:23 who can do this platform should be doing
25:25 it in their own way
25:26 if we can open source the whole platform
25:29 that's fantastic so someone could just
25:30 borrow the platform and launch a node
25:32 in spain launch one of venezuela lands
25:35 one in china
25:36 and that way we can start getting it up
25:37 if one gets knocked down it doesn't
25:39 matter
25:40 we can always make it work
25:45 but imagine they do those crazy events
25:48 and i guarantee you they're just licking
25:49 their chops
25:50 there are people who are alive right now
25:53 because of the current president united
25:55 states
25:56 at least in the mass products eyes
26:01 they're going to be dead in six months
26:03 because they're going to try to go after
26:05 our second amendment this is going to
26:07 happen
26:08 these people are going to die unless
26:11 someone nuts up in the military and gets
26:13 this thing reset
26:15 but we have to assume that they're
26:16 completely compromised
26:18 that regardless of taking an oath to the
26:20 constitution all these scumbags are
26:22 willing to get paid off
26:24 and if they're not want to get paid off
26:25 then they're the greatest heroes on
26:26 planet earth
26:27 in all of our respective countries but
26:30 imagine one of those events happens and
26:31 there's a hundred people in a mall in el
26:33 paso texas
26:34 all pulling out their phones all sending
26:36 up videos and audio
26:38 because the platform exists
26:41 oh sure they can beam a little network
26:44 that will help
26:44 you know block your ability to get on
26:46 the network or whatever but you still
26:48 have your phone
26:49 that's taking pictures movies you're
26:51 typing everything in so that when you
26:54 walk out of zone of their kill zone
26:56 which apparently on the 6th of january
26:58 they had a kill zone for your internet
27:01 which was strange because i was able to
27:02 text friends
27:04 who were sitting in the bleachers
27:07 or probably standing in the bleachers
27:10 but as soon as you walk out of that dead
27:11 zone all your stuff goes up to the
27:13 network
27:15 so then we
27:18 we inform ourselves we don't get the
27:21 information from
27:22 a crappy source that the event is even
27:24 occurring
27:25 we inform ourselves this is occurring
27:29 let's just say you're um in a particular
27:32 part of the world an event occurs
27:36 and then we in our network have a ton of
27:38 alerts that pop
27:39 up and if we are connected into that
27:42 area of the world which we are going to
27:44 connect where our world matters
27:46 you realize that if you know people in
27:49 new york but you live in california
27:51 but you have family in new york or
27:53 friends of new york then you're
27:54 automatically caring about their world
27:57 it's designed around your sphere of
27:58 influences and your friends
28:01 sphere of influences
28:02 [Music]
28:05 then we control the narrative we control
28:08 what's coming in
28:10 now it might be let's just think about
28:13 the contingencies okay
28:14 it might be a situation where something
28:17 is coming in so
28:18 severe you've only got one friend who
28:20 saw one thing
28:21 for a split second but
28:25 you want the rest of the information but
28:27 you personally do not have
28:29 contacts in that area to give you more
28:32 information
28:35 then you can study the network just like
28:37 you study linkedin
28:39 you can study the network and the
28:40 degrees to see if there's anyone else
28:43 from the person the one person that you
28:45 have that you could branch out from
28:47 let's say they have a strong 25-year
28:49 relationship because it's their brother
28:51 their uncle their mother
28:52 whatever you might be able to do a
28:54 temporary subscription until you
28:56 validate them for permanent subscription
28:58 to get the extra information i mean i
29:01 don't know about you but this sounds so
29:03 freaking exciting to me it's crazy
29:06 because it puts it into the whole thing
29:10 i'm actually going to attempt to get
29:11 this all the way to the former white
29:13 house administration
29:15 because i think i might have a
29:16 connection that can help me out with
29:17 that
29:19 but this should be huge dear relatives
29:22 that go back to those old organizations
29:23 because they're old
29:26 it won't matter anymore but now imagine
29:29 this
29:31 your area is going to be in an elective
29:35 situation in a year or two or four or
29:37 whatever
29:39 but now all the votes and all the polls
29:42 that are coming in are coming in from
29:44 your network of individuals
29:47 so now the integrity of your information
29:50 can potentially go up considerably
29:53 i had a design of a of a separate site
29:55 that would also be very interesting for
29:57 this one
29:58 although now that i've studied how
30:02 this information could come in it all
30:04 has to be
30:05 related to our the spine of our sight is
30:07 all of the
30:08 acknowledged relationships that we have
30:11 with each other
30:12 they have to be the most scrutinized
30:15 connections
30:16 between each other meaning when you say
30:18 this person is your uncle
30:21 they need to be alive in the network and
30:24 confirming that that
30:25 you two have a physical uh genome
30:28 relationship with each other
30:29 or your friends or whatever you have to
30:33 be able to provide this is an
30:34 acquaintance
30:35 that i just met and so it goes low on
30:38 your integrity
30:39 over time if you thumb up one of their
30:42 reports
30:43 and say i found this report to be very
30:45 very valid
30:46 then that acquaintance meter and really
30:50 the truth meter of even your relatives
30:51 or closest friends keeps going up and up
30:53 and up and up
30:55 that doesn't mean again that they can't
30:57 infiltrate you a little bit
30:59 but you should know whether or not
31:00 you're buying news off someone meaning
31:03 you're
31:03 believing it of someone you don't even
31:06 know
31:07 that's the problem with twitter that's
31:09 the problem with facebook
31:11 is as long as some you know
31:15 foreign country some foreign
31:16 intelligence posts a pretty booby
31:18 picture
31:19 of some girl there's 90 guys 90
31:23 000 guys that will subscribe to it
31:24 because they're so hard up because
31:25 they're watching too much porn at home
31:28 because you're saying i got a chance
31:29 right that's what they think
31:32 i don't know if women fall for the hunky
31:33 guy thing as much as men fall for the
31:35 other thing
31:36 but there's more emotional things i
31:38 think they could probably trick women
31:39 with
31:39 don't know we're all flawed as what i'm
31:42 saying when it comes to this because we
31:44 haven't said
31:45 that it's important that our friends are
31:47 really our friends and not just a bunch
31:49 of random people we met on the internet
31:50 that looked pretty in our feeds
31:53 it's it's okay to have that of course
31:55 i'm not trying to judge anybody i do
31:57 that i got plenty of friends in the
31:58 music business
31:59 and i've met a fraction of them face to
32:01 face
32:02 had quite a few conversations with them
32:04 i'm now getting rid of folks out of my
32:06 my one facebook account that has any
32:08 traffic who've never
32:10 looked at anything that i've ever posted
32:12 never responded to me never chatted
32:14 it's like hey don't wish any any ill
32:16 things i
32:17 don't have any uh judgment on you it's
32:19 just obviously we don't have a
32:20 connection and i don't need the pretty
32:22 face
32:22 as a part of my thing if that were the
32:24 case
32:26 the other thing about blockchaining all
32:28 the data which is now just a ubiquitous
32:30 platform that everybody could use
32:33 is that now we can all get copies of the
32:35 data and it all gets locked away whoever
32:36 wants to process the blockchain
32:38 of the news network okay well
32:42 i can have a copy of everything if i've
32:43 got enough space for it so something's
32:45 reported there's no censorship
32:48 the other thing is is if there's any
32:50 news that we deem to be untrue
32:53 we all pile into that resource we kill
32:55 that article
32:56 and it's gone the other distinction that
33:00 we might put into any one
33:01 thing that's reported is we know that
33:04 we've come up with
33:05 memes memes are a way to get past a lot
33:07 of the artificial intelligence although
33:09 they're getting really good at reading
33:12 what's in a meme or at least having a
33:13 group of human beings tag a meme so it
33:15 can't be in there now we would never
33:17 have any problems on ours
33:18 in terms of censoring that kind of stuff
33:22 however we know that there's a lot of
33:24 gullible people
33:25 who can be sent photographs that are
33:29 completely
33:30 you know photoshopped and they're not
33:32 reporting that it's photoshopped they're
33:34 reporting that it's true
33:35 and everyone else is looking at that
33:36 data going
33:38 that's simply not true and so you might
33:41 have to school
33:42 a few of your family members friends to
33:44 say okay
33:45 this person is is literally more
33:47 gullible we could even have a little
33:49 funny
33:50 check mark that says in my opinion this
33:53 is gullible
33:54 and then they say they have like 50
33:56 connections which would be quite a bit
33:57 in this network right
33:58 again i don't think you need 500 friends
34:01 in this system
34:02 you don't you just need enough people a
34:05 hen full of people
34:06 in every area that you're interested in
34:09 downtown los angeles which would
34:11 probably take you 50 people just to
34:12 cover the ground
34:14 effectively miami new york chicago
34:16 dallas wherever it is paris uh whatever
34:21 and then if everyone piled in and said
34:22 this particular article was untrue
34:27 or they simply have to when they submit
34:29 something they're submitting
34:30 a piece of information and they have to
34:32 say
34:33 this isn't me this isn't a photograph
34:36 out of my telephone
34:37 at the event this is a piece of this is
34:40 a meme that i put up there
34:43 it could be earmarked as pure
34:44 entertainment it could be earmarked as
34:46 someone saying
34:47 is this true i found this image on the
34:49 internet
34:50 of a particular guy
34:53 who might be a hunter and
34:56 i don't know if this stuff in the
34:58 bedroom or this hotel room is actually
35:00 true or false let me know what you think
35:02 and so they post it in there
35:03 and it's quarantined away from you
35:04 unless you want to see things that might
35:07 be true or might be false
35:09 then you get to put your opinion in but
35:11 your opinion could also be
35:13 with a little bit of information we
35:15 could be our own little snopes
35:17 to say well you know i can see right
35:19 there it looks like photoshop right
35:20 there and
35:21 oh by the way that picture of him
35:22 actually comes with this photo over here
35:24 and then we journalism balance our own
35:27 stuff
35:29 you see the information that you're
35:30 getting that's creating this matrix that
35:32 we call history
35:33 around us it's coming in as truth from
35:36 those
35:37 sources that aren't truth
35:41 it's coming in validated even though it
35:44 shouldn't be validated
35:46 that's the problem we're also infatuated
35:48 with individuals
35:50 the the anchors they get popular
35:55 if an anchor is so popular that you're
35:57 really dying because you like that
35:59 individual
35:59 i can't tell you how many people i've
36:01 had in a room that said
36:03 oh i love anderson cooper and then i
36:04 show him the vanderbilt pool
36:06 where all those crazy tony podesta are
36:09 but the kids are being tied up and
36:10 tortured
36:12 happened in the vanderbilt pool which is
36:14 the same house that
36:15 anderson cooper grew up in well then
36:18 they uh they go oh my god really i'm
36:20 like yeah
36:21 stop worshiping these agents of evil
36:25 these mockingbird press people who think
36:29 because they've been told they're
36:30 special you're not part of the peasant
36:32 race
36:33 so we must punish the peasants with
36:36 disinformation and
36:37 they have to be told what's going on the
36:39 first person who thinks that they have
36:40 the authority to tell other people
36:42 what's going on in the world and how
36:44 they should live their life
36:45 are usually the biggest morons on planet
36:49 earth
36:50 so isn't it funny how that works what
36:53 makes you an elite
36:54 having a low vibration iq and yeah they
36:57 may have a tone
36:59 of the history of the world and say yeah
37:00 well i know what actually happened in
37:02 this world and you don't
37:04 that doesn't make you more intelligent
37:05 than anybody
37:07 if anything you need a cheat sheet to
37:09 figure out how the world worked
37:10 we're deducing it more accurately from
37:12 our end
37:14 because everything's got to spin right
37:17 this isn't really a super engineering
37:21 feet this is more 98
37:24 brilliant design than it is brilliant
37:27 engineering
37:28 it's going to take some some work but
37:31 even just with a basic connection pool
37:33 system
37:34 where i can validate you to me and track
37:36 this and give a star rating and then
37:38 immediately launch an interface where
37:40 you can at least report
37:41 immediate news that's going on in your
37:43 area
37:44 meaning you're standing in ontario
37:46 canada and all of a sudden the chinese
37:48 ccp starts occupying your your street
37:51 with
37:53 troops you can immediately take your
37:55 phone out the window go ting ting ting
37:56 ting ting
37:57 and submit a whole gallery to the site
38:00 with the time of day location what
38:02 you're seeing make sure you know that we
38:05 we actually help the person submitting
38:06 things to understand
38:08 you know please don't submit any uh
38:11 subjective views into the article
38:13 meaning don't tell us something's
38:14 happening that
38:16 that you just speculate is happening
38:19 or maybe there's a description field
38:23 that says describe exactly what you're
38:26 seeing
38:26 don't add anything else tab down
38:30 the next description field you know 5
38:32 000 characters of pop
38:35 give us your opinion of what you think
38:37 is happening
38:38 [Music]
38:40 that way we can look at an article and
38:42 determine
38:43 what part we're sure of that the author
38:45 is sure of and what the part that they
38:47 think
38:47 could be happening and that way they're
38:50 not on the hook for misleading us
38:52 because they simply said this is what i
38:53 think is occurring it seems like this is
38:55 what's occurring
38:57 it divides up the data perfectly the way
38:58 the brain wants to modify or
39:00 ingest the data in the first place now
39:03 in terms of the
39:04 super produced pieces of video
39:08 that we're so accustomed to we're
39:11 addicted to
39:12 beautifully produced documentaries and
39:14 that kind of thing
39:16 i think there's a place for that within
39:18 the system
39:20 but imagine we didn't have any
39:21 technology whatsoever we didn't have any
39:23 computers and we didn't have any
39:25 video devices of any kind and we're back
39:28 to sort of the
39:29 i don't say the 18 the year 1800
39:34 the only thing we'd have at that point
39:35 is maybe a printing press let's say we
39:37 don't have that
39:39 we would be living by word of mouth
39:40 between us and we'd be using the
39:42 integrity models as this site has
39:44 been designed in this episode to
39:46 determine
39:47 who is telling the truth and who is it
39:50 like if i walked home in 1800 and i said
39:52 mom dad the british troops uh
39:56 appeared on the coast of uh maryland or
39:59 whatever and they seemed pretty pissed
40:01 off and they seem to be like fully
40:02 loaded and walking in this direction in
40:04 a single file
40:06 it would be my integrity with my parents
40:09 my friends
40:10 that would either make them go oh my god
40:11 let's get out of here or let's go get
40:13 our muskets and get going let's have a
40:15 nice minuteman fight
40:17 or i'm a boy who called wolf and i was
40:19 like yeah whatever
40:21 didn't you see some flying light in the
40:23 sky yesterday the chariot that landed
40:25 and
40:26 gave you a ham sandwich we've been
40:28 wanting to fix this problem for a very
40:30 very long time haven't we
40:33 but again we haven't been organized with
40:35 our
40:36 successes we've had successes
40:39 everyone's had a friend who's on the
40:41 ground uh currently we're waiting for
40:44 the insurrection act to be
40:45 activated but nothing's happening
40:48 apparently
40:49 you know visually when you look at the
40:51 world however
40:53 a lot of us have folks that have been
40:55 reactivated into the military
40:57 we're getting all kinds of like first
41:00 degree if not second degree
41:01 testimonies people here in orange county
41:03 california are
41:04 walking into cigar land just going yeah
41:06 i just got back from
41:07 gitmo and then we say well we've heard
41:10 it's been retrofitted with a bunch of
41:12 new
41:12 cells and we've had two different guys
41:15 in two different locations get the same
41:16 exact story
41:19 and the dudes uh both of them said uh
41:21 yeah how do you know that we did that
41:24 and then we explained you know that
41:26 movement they told us that stuff showed
41:27 us the satellite photographs they're
41:28 like wow yeah i've been too busy to even
41:30 know that that was going around the net
41:32 and then we asked both of them hey well
41:34 who's going to be in that place and they
41:35 give us slightly different answers but
41:37 it means exactly the same thing
41:39 one guy told a best friend of mine
41:42 first degree best friend of mine
41:45 he said royalty now it could be
41:48 celebrity royalty it could be royalty
41:50 royalty could be ceo
41:51 financial royalty who knows what that
41:53 answer means but they're already
41:54 training troops in gitmo
41:56 not to be shocked about the people that
41:58 are going to be coming into that place
41:59 that's a fact whether or not they
42:01 actually have the balls to pull it off
42:03 i'm going to breathe deeply until they
42:05 do
42:07 but we have to have profound inventions
42:09 sometimes
42:11 to shake into us new paradigms and shake
42:15 out of us the old paradigms
42:18 but what i want you to do when you
42:19 listen to this episode is just think
42:21 about how you've ever
42:22 survived without electronic data even
42:26 in this modern age let's say you're 25
42:27 years old or what have you
42:29 you still have a network of buddies in
42:32 your local area you don't read
42:34 mass products on the internet to find
42:36 out whether or not your friend
42:38 is coming into town or whether or not
42:39 two people got married or two people got
42:41 divorced
42:42 two people went on a date you're using
42:43 your friend network to figure this out
42:45 and immediately the integrity of your
42:47 friends and their past
42:50 travels with you determine whether or
42:52 not you're going to give it any
42:53 credibility
42:54 so all we're doing is we're
42:56 industrializing this process
42:59 again with a little bit of clever due
43:02 diligence
43:03 with ip addresses gps
43:06 coordinates we can start filtering out
43:08 all this fake stuff
43:10 because no one from a foreign country
43:12 who could report
43:13 that they're in your area i mean they
43:15 could actually hack a phone and maybe
43:16 get some
43:17 bad data in there whatever they could
43:20 actually put a phone
43:21 technically in a region of the world
43:25 and jack into that phone remotely and
43:27 then submit it
43:28 from say manhattan where it's like oh we
43:32 need
43:32 we need the phone and that street to be
43:34 activated so we can report false news
43:38 well as soon as they do it as soon as
43:40 they report something bad
43:41 one nobody knows that individual in the
43:43 real world so there's no network for
43:44 them to gain any credibility
43:46 if they try to build a big network and
43:48 then they have a couple
43:49 little backstabbers here's the funny
43:53 thing
43:54 how about you have to have physically
43:57 verified the face face of a particular
44:00 individual
44:01 if you want to come from a complete
44:02 outside source i need to be able to meet
44:04 you at a
44:06 at a coffee shop and snap your face and
44:08 my camera
44:09 and has the face recognition the one
44:11 that you've submitted online
44:13 but once i got your face then i put that
44:16 in your file
44:16 you can't edit it and then 10 other
44:19 people snap your face
44:20 and they put it in that file saying i've
44:22 met this person in four or five
44:23 locations in manhattan
44:25 okay go ahead and report some bad news
44:28 go ahead and manipulate
44:30 a million people in your local area to
44:32 believe something that's wrong and now
44:34 we got your face
44:38 good luck being a fugitive for the rest
44:39 of your life
44:41 absolute integrity at its best
44:44 governed by the people we could turn the
44:47 whole world into a village
44:50 sized organization by using this
44:52 technique
44:56 and you know there's all kinds of uh
44:59 techniques although they're
45:00 they have to be governed very carefully
45:02 but you know there's a lot of places
45:03 where they want your id
45:05 to prove that you are who you are
45:07 usually they'll want a driver's license
45:08 passport or something like that with
45:10 your face on it
45:12 all the addresses confirmed they've also
45:15 got
45:16 subscriptions to those services really
45:18 look up in the public records whether or
45:19 not you actually are a real person and
45:21 you know if i submit mine i've had to do
45:23 it recently for some 3d modeling
45:26 outlets which i'm going to start selling
45:27 some of my stuff
45:30 they can verify i really exist they look
45:32 at public records that's me
45:35 we're off to the races but now imagine
45:38 that
45:38 the validation of being sort of a public
45:42 figure
45:42 which we don't really want any of those
45:45 is that they've submitted their passport
45:47 and driver's license now you know those
45:48 can be forged pretty easily especially
45:50 in photoshop
45:52 they're hijacking someone's identity in
45:53 a particular part of the world
45:56 so the network that hosts this service
46:00 gives you a little check mark that says
46:02 okay we've received some identification
46:04 that seems to check out
46:06 however no one from the totally trusted
46:09 network
46:10 has ever seen them face to face and
46:12 snapped their photograph and submitted
46:14 that back into the system to say are
46:16 these the same people
46:18 it could even be you submit your
46:19 passport or driver's license
46:23 they verify with you know some some
46:26 database lookup that you really do exist
46:28 at that location
46:29 they're not sure if you look like that
46:31 because that's never in any public
46:32 system i think you have access to
46:34 but now they scrape your faces off both
46:37 ids
46:38 subtract you know delete the rest of the
46:40 photograph never save
46:42 your private data ever to be stolen in
46:44 any way shape or form
46:46 and then someone says i'm going to go to
46:48 the
46:50 from your network from your network from
46:52 the ones that you know and you trust
46:54 they're saying i'm willing to meet this
46:55 person at a coffee shop
46:57 pow we hit your face we submit that
46:59 photograph now we have the two from your
47:01 id that have been verified by the
47:03 website and now here comes all the third
47:05 person photographs of you
47:07 that people you could just look and go
47:09 okay there's 10 photographs of this
47:11 person
47:12 that really is a real person and if
47:14 they've been met 10 times
47:16 20 times 50 times 100 times by average
47:19 people
47:20 within say orange county newport
47:22 california well they must
47:25 live there they're really spending a lot
47:26 of money to validate themselves
47:28 but here's the thing they're only as
47:31 good as their data
47:32 so let's say you're totally validated
47:34 you got a blue check mark from the new
47:35 system
47:37 but you start misleading people you're
47:39 just either a bad reporter or you're one
47:41 of george soros's little agents
47:44 do you get a slam rating and then we
47:47 lock your profile
47:48 with your photographs all available for
47:50 people to see
47:52 we subtract your id photos i mean you're
47:56 going to agree to some
47:57 terms of service to have those visible
48:00 but now we just have your photograph as
48:02 a person
48:03 whose integrity is very low
48:07 there's no law you broke no one's going
48:08 to put you in jail or anything
48:10 but you'll get a scarlet letter you'll
48:12 become an esop fable
48:14 with a boy who called wolf i'm sure you
48:17 guys have
48:19 a ton of ideas to add to this to put the
48:20 network together
48:22 what i'm going to do after the episode
48:23 is i'm going to run inside
48:25 i'm going to go ahead and get this all
48:26 uploaded and editing
48:29 i'm going to do some work while i do the
48:32 editing
48:33 we'll get it out the door i'm actually
48:35 going to make a few phone calls right
48:36 after i get this episode done
48:37 so i know some folks that might be
48:39 interested in helping you put this
48:41 together apparently i have a
48:43 second degree relationship with the ceo
48:46 of
48:47 so i'm going to see if there might be
48:48 some interest with that
48:50 now i'm more interested in any of your
48:52 observations if you're a techie
48:55 that you think this system wouldn't work
48:57 due to a particular
48:59 oversight on my part i do believe that
49:03 if there is an oversight that we can
49:06 fill that that hole in the dike if you
49:09 will
49:10 in a way that will be okay in the end
49:15 but it's i think within 12 months if we
49:18 get this product launched
49:19 even its most infant form and say
49:23 six months those organizations that we
49:26 hate so much
49:28 will be out of business in six months
49:30 after our launch
49:32 so imagine that one year they're off the
49:34 face of the planet
49:36 oh they'll still exist but they will be
49:39 sucking on fumes
49:40 their advertisers will be like hey
49:42 there's no one watching your stuff
49:45 we're buying ads at minds.com we're
49:47 buying ads at gab we're buying ads at
49:49 whatever new network that might be
49:50 hosting this
49:52 and again if we can open source the code
49:55 such that it's just a platform that you
49:57 can launch
49:59 and maybe maybe individuals at those
50:01 organizations
50:03 come up with improvements but we treat
50:04 it like blender 3d
50:06 blender 3d is a free 3d application if
50:08 you ever want to do special effects at
50:10 3d
50:10 it's free and it's it's supported by the
50:13 entire world
50:14 there's a million lessons online and on
50:16 youtube so you can completely become a
50:18 3d expert visual effects expert
50:20 composite expert
50:21 using a free product it doesn't feel
50:24 free it feels like the most expensive
50:26 product you've ever touched in your life
50:27 but it is free and it's always been free
50:30 so when someone invents something cool
50:33 they can actually put it inside the
50:34 product
50:35 so when it ships it comes with this new
50:37 feature because some brainiac in russia
50:40 figured out how to do something
50:42 by the way they then get a job at the
50:44 blender foundation in amsterdam
50:46 and poof so if we keep this pretty open
50:49 source
50:49 the thing is is if you're willing to
50:52 host this information
50:53 then advertisers are willing to put ads
50:56 around your information
50:58 imagine you become a pretty damn good
51:00 journalist
51:01 you're either a live action journalist
51:03 meaning you're reporting on exactly
51:04 what's happening at the time
51:05 or you're a real journalist that goes
51:07 off and does super deep dives on things
51:09 like project veritas
51:11 imagine that project veritas is a good
51:13 example they've been
51:15 pretty much two thumbs up the entire
51:17 time
51:18 so if you wanted to write an article and
51:20 cite veritas but you've never met the
51:21 duty runs veritas
51:23 you automatically know and so does the
51:24 world but up to this point
51:26 their information has been outstanding
51:29 if they slip
51:30 we should have you know they make a
51:32 mistake they get some dis info on their
51:34 system they take an interview with
51:35 someone who's pretending
51:36 to be an employee of something that
51:37 they're not and they accidentally slip
51:39 out something bad
51:40 then we have to have probably a system
51:42 where
51:43 you know veritas will get knocked down
51:45 in the public eye if that would ever
51:46 occur i doubt that would ever happen
51:49 but at the same time they need a way to
51:52 to revise their news to say oh my gosh
51:55 we just got had
51:56 super sorry we are deprecating this
51:59 article out of existence
52:00 and apologize apologize 100 times now
52:03 again
52:05 fool me once shame on you fool me twice
52:07 shame on me
52:08 that little theory would be built into
52:10 the system
52:12 but this could actually help all these
52:14 organizations that are independent
52:16 and finding out information think about
52:18 all these really cool
52:20 you know channels that have had to leave
52:22 formal platforms because they got
52:23 censored
52:24 now they're on other platforms and they
52:26 want to report the news so then
52:28 they already have all these contacts all
52:29 these ones that they trust
52:31 they upload the infrastructure of their
52:35 network
52:35 into the system now
52:38 of course there's always you know
52:41 supposedly top secret sources and that
52:42 kind of stuff so they're going to
52:43 struggle
52:44 they're going to struggle to put out
52:45 stuff simon parks is going to struggle
52:48 charlie ward's going to struggle you
52:51 know
52:51 charlie ward told the whole world that
52:53 he got the inauguration like eight hours
52:55 before it actually happened
52:57 problem he never published it to prove
53:00 that he got it beforehand never even
53:03 published a screenshot
53:05 now supposedly a bunch of other people
53:07 in europe
53:08 confirmed that they also saw it ahead of
53:09 time so maybe they're telling the truth
53:12 but wouldn't you like to know whether or
53:13 not he was telling the truth or not
53:15 he could put that and piece of news
53:17 directly into this network
53:19 it goes full blockchain he never has to
53:21 release it on the ones that will censor
53:23 him
53:24 and then we can all have proof because
53:26 we're watching the inauguration four
53:27 hours before
53:28 it happened i personally don't believe
53:30 that's true
53:31 i don't care what anyone says someone
53:33 would have published it ahead of time
53:34 on the net and we all would have had our
53:36 jaws on the ground that this
53:38 this pre-recorded event was indeed
53:41 pre-recorded
53:42 anyway i'm not sure this is a full hour
53:46 about 110 on my side been a lot of noise
53:49 disruptions so we might
53:50 hopefully after i cut the 10 minutes out
53:52 i had a false start by the way i forgot
53:54 to
53:54 turn the camera on so i talked for about
53:55 two minutes and the camera stopped so
53:57 hopefully i've hit an hour
53:59 but i don't think it matters how long
54:00 this thing is you got the information
54:03 let's mulch it i'll be the
54:06 gatherer of all the data feel free to
54:08 run off with this idea and do your own
54:10 thing completely
54:11 spend your own money make this happen
54:13 talk to your own buddies on
54:14 networks and get this thing going but if
54:17 you aren't totally excited
54:19 then push stop rewind the playhead and
54:22 play it back until you get it
54:24 because i think this is gigantic if you
54:26 haven't been to deepthoughtsradio.com
54:28 please go
54:29 it's got everything video audio social
54:32 media
