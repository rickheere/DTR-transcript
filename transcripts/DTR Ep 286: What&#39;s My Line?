00:00 [Music]
00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies
00:36 gentlemen today we're gonna cover a
00:39 subject that some of you may not have
00:41 any clue about especially if you're
00:44 brand new to the show I will say hang in
00:47 there because you might find this
00:49 particular show one of the most
00:51 endearing sweet amazing shows to binge
00:56 watch on YouTube for free
00:59 I found this show through a very
01:03 interesting set of circumstances and
01:05 that someone asked me when I guess I was
01:08 talking in in one of my episodes about
01:11 the JFK assassination they said well
01:13 have you ever heard of Dorothy Kilgallen
01:16 and of course I hadn't and I was like
01:19 okay so look her up online someone I
01:22 think give me a link or something but I
01:24 I clicked on it and I got some videos
01:28 about her being a journalist in the mid
01:30 60s and she dies mysteriously and I've
01:37 heard all kinds of different stories
01:38 there's an official story online and
01:41 then there's folks that were alive and
01:43 near her that I've talked to just
01:46 randomly recently that have a slightly
01:49 different facts when the most important
01:51 facts was she was not found in her own
01:53 home she was found in a different
01:56 location that was later reported that
01:57 she was found in her own home having
01:59 died of a mysterious cocktail of drugs
02:01 which is sort of how a Marilyn Monroe
02:03 was accident at rain but this episode is
02:07 not about the specifics of that because
02:11 I've only delve into it a little bit
02:13 this is about a television show at the
02:17 very beginning of television in the
02:20 world 1950 television had only existed
02:25 for a very brief time before then
02:28 television in the 40s was very nebulous
02:31 there were no networks there were no
02:33 shows that had really gained an audience
02:38 you know they hadn't really built the
02:40 studios to house this kind of stuff the
02:42 technology was still evolving to be able
02:45 to do basic things people were filming
02:48 handwritten signs so that they could say
02:51 the title of their show would have any
02:53 special effects or anything I think it
02:56 was banging olsen they came up with the
02:58 first television in 1939 little teeny
03:02 tiny television smaller than a original
03:04 macintosh from the 1984 right but you
03:09 fast forward to 1950 and CBS had
03:13 greenlit this show called What's My Line
03:15 and we don't use the word line like we
03:19 use it today linemen line of work we
03:22 still say that today but we always say
03:23 it together
03:24 what kind of line of work you in what
03:27 you line of work but we don't say what's
03:30 my line or what's your line but I guess
03:33 back in the day they did show so the
03:37 show is very brilliant and simple there
03:40 are guests that come on there's four
03:43 panelists that have to ask questions and
03:45 there's a host the guest comes on the
03:49 show and they sign their name and the
03:53 host Jon Daly who was the host from the
03:56 very beginning to the very end this show
03:58 ran 17 years okay amazing the format
04:04 changed a little bit when if when the
04:05 audience came in and well I'll get to
04:08 the point why I'm making this episode in
04:09 just a second I've hinted at it and
04:10 previous episodes but if you're brand
04:12 new to the show and you see this in fact
04:15 if you love What's My Line and you've
04:17 never seen the rest of my show I'm just
04:19 gonna say be careful watching the rest
04:20 of the show all the other episodes they
04:22 have nothing to do with this kind of
04:23 stuff and you may not agree with my take
04:25 in this but I think
04:26 you will I sit in a room with folks that
04:29 are twenty years my senior and I lament
04:33 about this and they agree with me the
04:35 point of this show is to demonstrate
04:40 that the female community of this world
04:42 was not only respected but extremely
04:45 capable extremely employed and anything
04:48 but barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen
04:51 okay so that's that's the theme of the
04:54 show but to rewind at the beginning of
04:58 the format the show had the guests be
05:00 introduced as to their name but their
05:02 mister or missus miss or mrs. just look
05:05 at the salutation correct and then they
05:07 would March them down in front of the or
05:09 have them walk in front of the panelists
05:11 and initially the panels could ask them
05:12 questions look at their hands to see if
05:14 they you know had tool marks on their
05:16 hands whether they were manicured
05:20 everyone dressed up that was the cool
05:23 thing so the women were these beautiful
05:24 dresses even the panelists but they'd
05:27 March them in front of the panelists
05:28 come and sit down and here's the way the
05:31 show is scored a basic element of the
05:35 guest is announced by John Daly the host
05:37 which is usually self-employed or
05:41 salaried which means you work they work
05:44 for someone else and then the questions
05:47 randomly begin with one of the panelists
05:49 the panelists are very important is this
05:51 where Dorothy Kilgallen was on the show
05:54 almost every single episode until we
05:58 think she was murdered some fifteen
06:01 years later now the four panelists may
06:04 have usually eventually boiled down to
06:06 two women and two men the very first
06:08 couple episodes had three men and one
06:10 woman one woman excuse me Dorothy
06:12 Kilgallen but they're able to ask the
06:14 guests any number of questions until the
06:16 guests gets to say no ten times and for
06:20 every single time they say no they get
06:22 five bucks now in 1950 it's about $600
06:28 when you win 50 bucks it's about 600
06:30 bucks in our day and age but again these
06:33 are mortal people producing a show
06:36 paying for the studio time paying
06:38 everyone's salary somebody
06:40 salaries were really high okay one of
06:43 the guests by 1953 was getting paid
06:46 $1000 in episode well Dorothy was
06:49 getting $500 in episode still amazing
06:51 amounts of money for appearing every
06:54 Sunday night I don't know the exact
06:57 broadcast time now the reality is is I'm
07:01 gonna just glance through the form out
07:03 of the show
07:04 real quickly so that when you see it you
07:06 really understand what you're looking at
07:07 what the show evolved to very quickly
07:10 within the first year was that the first
07:13 two guests were just normal human beings
07:16 from our walk of life but the third
07:20 guest was what they called a mystery
07:22 guests and all the panelists set to put
07:23 on blindfolds because someone would walk
07:26 out who's extremely famous the crowd
07:28 would go crazy they signed their name
07:30 they sit down and then the panelists get
07:33 eventually they only get one question in
07:35 mind if they're right or wrong it moves
07:36 to the next person until again either
07:38 Vance or ten wrong or as 10 questions
07:40 that equal an O answer or they find out
07:43 who it is now most the time with the
07:46 famous guests they usually can figure
07:48 out who they are and there's reasons for
07:51 that which I'll get to but you might you
07:54 mean you have the most famous people on
07:56 planet Earth on this show Walt Disney
08:00 Sammy Davis jr. you have every female
08:05 actress that's been anyone from Betty
08:09 White she looks so absolutely gorgeous
08:13 you have a young Barbara Streisand Julie
08:18 Garland and sometimes those famous
08:22 people guest as panelists at a later
08:26 time so Sammy Davis jr. was a panel of
08:28 several time several times you have
08:30 Ronald Reagan as a panelist at one point
08:33 in time and he's also a guest now the
08:36 guests when they're famous they
08:38 typically change their voice which makes
08:40 it SuperDuper funny to see people
08:42 talking voices that they don't have and
08:46 some of them are utterly brilliant and
08:49 then if there's time there's a fourth
08:52 guest that usually has the free
08:54 the abbreviated timespan and what'll end
08:56 up taking place is that the one out of
08:58 time and so John Daly the host who was
09:01 one of the most famous news broadcasters
09:05 in history when Pearl Harbor was hit
09:06 John Daly was one of the I think he
09:09 worked for CBS but he's one of the first
09:12 journalists to announce the attack on
09:14 Pearl Harbor back in 1941 December 7th
09:17 so he is moonlighting as the host of
09:21 What's My Line but he's doing all kinds
09:24 of other stuff in the news broadcasting
09:26 world during the week so the show
09:29 evolves and simplifies and they get rid
09:31 of the what they call walk of shame the
09:34 first year or so the panelists were
09:36 sitting down as soon as the show started
09:39 and eventually the audience said well we
09:41 want to know what the women are wearing
09:43 they're wearing these beautiful dresses
09:44 we'd like to see them walk out in these
09:46 beautiful dresses and so eventually the
09:48 show matures and the women start walking
09:50 out the men are always in tuxedos but
09:55 now let's rewind to the theme of this
09:58 show I just bumped into this out of thin
10:02 air and I almost think it's sort of I
10:03 bumped into it as a destiny for my own
10:06 brain and my own gut feeling that the
10:09 world wasn't this way that women were
10:11 not repressed that women I mean there
10:13 was a point when women couldn't vote and
10:15 that was well handled by 1950 and
10:17 definitely completely solved by this
10:20 strange thing that broke apart the
10:22 United States of America by the mid to
10:25 late 70s the feminist movement which we
10:28 now know through Aaron Rizzo who's
10:30 friends with Nick Rockefeller that that
10:33 was a big scam to get women into the
10:35 workforce such that they would be taxed
10:37 that's nothing new women in the
10:39 workforce was nothing new so even some
10:44 of that it's sort of a spin off from the
10:47 truth but you had that a woman had the
10:49 choice to stay home and raise her
10:50 children and be a housewife I have one
10:54 grandmother who was a housewife and
10:55 raised five children I have another
10:57 grandmother who raised two children and
10:59 she worked from the age of 17 to the age
11:02 of retirement I guess in her 60s as a
11:05 fifth grade schoolteacher so I start
11:08 watching the
11:08 show at home and I'm binge watching this
11:11 thing and I will tell you this the
11:14 mystery guests are pretty interesting
11:15 like Liberace went on there several
11:17 times and people that you know depending
11:19 on your age you'll know who these people
11:21 are you won't know who these people are
11:22 but a lot of times when you don't know
11:24 looking them up in Wikipedia is
11:26 fascinating look at them up on YouTube
11:28 but you have being Crosby and Fred
11:31 Astaire and you have I think Frank
11:34 Sinatra you have Frank Sinatra's
11:36 daughter later in the 60s these boots
11:39 are made for walking that's his daughter
11:41 who sings that song you have Lucy and
11:45 Desi you have Lucy by herself does he by
11:49 himself
11:50 everyone who was anyone between 1950 and
11:53 1957
11:54 came on this show now they have other
11:58 guests that they have to wear blindfolds
12:00 too because they'll be identified by
12:02 their appearance because they're
12:04 well-known politicians or they even have
12:06 like the buckingham palace guards come
12:09 in with their full russian or no
12:10 canadian bear hats you know and so the
12:13 audience sees it but the panelists can't
12:16 see it now before we get into the theme
12:24 of this I want to explain the panelists
12:26 that eventually ended up being the
12:27 common panelists on the show now Dorothy
12:31 Kilgallen
12:32 is a very interesting woman because her
12:34 father was a journalist in New York I
12:37 can't remember exactly what paper but
12:39 it's like the New York Times or
12:40 something back when it was normal but
12:44 she had gone off to school did it get to
12:47 get educated and eventually dropped out
12:49 of college and took her career into her
12:52 own hands which at the time was a very
12:53 common thing but all by herself she
12:56 developed a Broadway column that had
13:00 over 6,800 syndications across the
13:04 United States by 1960 it was called the
13:07 voice of Broadway and so she would just
13:10 monitor everything that's on Broadway
13:11 and report on who's who what's what just
13:16 a nice friendly tabloid without getting
13:20 into probably you know she got into a
13:22 few risky
13:22 but it would just be that it was it
13:25 wasn't so damning and hurtful like it is
13:27 today you know society had some rules
13:29 back in those days right and the way the
13:32 show gets introduced is that the the
13:34 first panelists
13:35 Dorothy usually is always the number one
13:37 position it changed a couple times but
13:39 eventually settled down that she was
13:40 always the first one in the room but
13:42 they have to introduce the person to
13:44 their left until they get all the way
13:45 around to last panelists on the fourth
13:47 one introducing John Daly
13:50 Dorothy comes out first the second
13:53 panelist vacillated between a person
13:57 that would be coming every single Sunday
13:59 to a random guest a really famous actor
14:04 or singer or performer and then it would
14:08 be a woman named Arlene Francis who we I
14:12 didn't grow up with her in any of my
14:15 walks of life she did a lot of on
14:16 Broadway work she did some music
14:19 she's an Armenian woman who's out of
14:22 utterly gorgeous she she was married to
14:26 a fairly famous man named Martin gable
14:27 and he would guest as well see this
14:30 husband wife trio or duo every once in a
14:33 while which is kind of interesting very
14:35 brilliant man but to Arlene's left it
14:40 changed between a guy named Bennett Cerf
14:43 who helped found Random House Publishing
14:46 which is Britt your dictionaries from -
14:50 a gentleman who was a comedian named
14:51 hablok HAL or how ablack excuse me and
14:55 Hal had made a career out of sort of
14:58 being one of these sort of edgy or
15:01 comedians and he was on from 1950 to
15:05 1953 and he's gonna be part of our story
15:09 because we're talking about the power of
15:11 women in this episode let's take a break
15:16 from setting up the show and let's just
15:18 talk about some of the people that are
15:19 on the show so I was raised in the 70s
15:22 right I watched personally housewives go
15:26 into the workforce earlier and earlier
15:29 and earlier housewives being convinced
15:33 that again raising a family was stupid
15:35 and working for some giant corporation
15:37 that doesn't care whether or not you
15:38 live or die well that's the end lb tall
15:41 peak of life rain but I thought the way
15:45 I was raised with this feminist movement
15:47 around me okay and the movies like 9:00
15:49 to 5:00 right
15:50 the women were weak even though now this
15:53 is funny even the women in my life
15:55 weren't weak the women in my hometown
15:57 weren't weak I bought what was coming
16:00 through the television I bought what was
16:01 coming to me from the silver screen
16:04 women were these weak things that ran in
16:06 the forests if a monster's chasing them
16:08 and they always fall and get themselves
16:09 killed or get their guy killed right
16:11 they were just barely intellectually
16:14 capable of holding a job you know yeah
16:17 women can work but you know there's sort
16:19 of the women that bring you coffee and
16:20 they're the ones that the bank tellers
16:22 they're never the bank presidents you
16:25 know always a weak job for that poor sad
16:28 brain that's between women's heads right
16:32 that's what I was taught either directly
16:35 on point or through metaphorical themes
16:38 and shows and movies that I watched hmm
16:42 what is a female versus a male real
16:45 quickly hmm they're made of all the same
16:48 stuff were made out of guys and on the
16:52 flip side were always taught his kids
16:53 that women or little girls actually
16:55 mature faster than boys and having had a
16:57 little girl I can tell you that's true
17:00 so we're getting this doublespeak but
17:03 we're believing the one that is
17:04 slanderous at least in my generation
17:08 women give birth to mitten men and women
17:10 are almost identical physiologically
17:13 except for our differences in birthing
17:16 right they're built to be a little bit
17:19 more sensitive on the right brain side
17:20 so that when the children have to have
17:23 someone empathetically feel their needs
17:24 a mother through millions of years of
17:27 whatever or God's design or both needs
17:30 to be it you know in touch with that
17:33 that doesn't mean stupid
17:34 it doesn't mean weak Jesus take care of
17:37 like five kids and tell me that's a job
17:40 for a week make person give me a break
17:42 right the mitten well we're supposed to
17:44 be left brain very myopic about killing
17:47 animals and cooking
17:49 the family s of food I know some
17:50 cultures are the opposite
17:52 whatever very few in the world are that
17:54 way but there is examples of that right
17:55 at least were told men are supposed to
17:58 be out there working we have to do all
18:00 the crazy stuff working coal mines and
18:02 do the solar stuff right I could go on
18:05 for an hour just in the indoctrination
18:07 that I had to swallow as a kid about
18:10 women being weak and it echoed in the
18:14 men around me to write as soon as there
18:17 was a difference between men's opinions
18:19 and women's opinions you know there was
18:21 definitely a group of guys that would
18:23 always go at the jugular of how stupid
18:25 they were it was never a majority of men
18:28 that adhered every once in a while and
18:31 then I started watching what's my line
18:34 and this was one of the coolest
18:36 experiences because I'm watching this at
18:39 my house and then I start watching it at
18:42 my smoke lounge and I have a gentleman
18:43 who's in his late 60s who comes and he
18:47 and I are so usually the last two guys
18:49 out of the place
18:49 and at one point we had them real
18:52 control and I said look if you ever seen
18:54 what's my line it's like no I said check
18:56 this out boom played it he's addicted
18:59 instantaneously he is from that
19:01 generation as a young man so he knows a
19:03 lot of these folks like Roy Rogers you
19:06 have John Wayne I mean it's just crazy
19:10 but you have a ton of females as well
19:13 they do an amazing job in this show a
19:16 balancing female guests versus male
19:18 guests and usually it's one woman one
19:20 man or one man at one moment usually let
19:22 the woman go first and then the mystery
19:25 guest is back and forth between male and
19:27 female just go look at the thumbnails on
19:29 YouTube and again I'm gonna restate this
19:33 so that if you guys are watching the
19:36 show or you're looking at the thumbnails
19:37 and you're not sure if you want to watch
19:39 it you're going to learn that it's the
19:42 normal people that bring out the most
19:44 humor and the most hilarious questions
19:48 because I'll give you an example
19:52 recently there was a show it's there's a
19:57 guy named Johnny ray look for one of his
19:59 earlier appearances I didn't know who
20:01 this guy was
20:02 a musician he's a singer but his show
20:05 has a guess that is a captain of a
20:09 garbage whenever they call those forgot
20:13 the name but the garbage boats you know
20:16 and so his product is garbage and so the
20:19 guests we're trying to figure out what
20:21 he did by trying to figure out what his
20:23 product was and for the first half of
20:26 the questions they're talking about
20:27 wearing garbage why would I wear this on
20:29 my body could I hold this would a woman
20:30 wear this on her body you know it just
20:32 got really hilarious that they're
20:34 talking about garbage thinking it was
20:36 some sort of apparel so you get these
20:39 funny little you know situations where
20:42 things happen like that but I keep
20:44 watching this I keep watching this and I
20:46 keep saying all these females come on
20:48 and their jobs are amazing I mean they
20:53 don't really put normal normal jobs on
20:56 there but they do I mean they have those
20:58 on there but the majority of the jobs
20:59 are sort of more interesting thus more
21:03 difficult to guess within whatever
21:05 number of questions twenty to thirty
21:07 questions and the interesting thing was
21:10 that you have the audience celebrating
21:13 their jobs because the way the show
21:15 works is that when the guest sits down
21:16 John Daly makes sure they understand how
21:19 the show is scored they did that for 17
21:21 years I can't believe they continued
21:23 doing that I don't think jeopardy
21:24 verifies the rules every single time
21:26 right but they'll say well now we're
21:28 gonna let the the audience and the
21:31 guests at home and the audience at home
21:33 see just what your line is in on our
21:36 television set
21:37 they overlay the name of the job and so
21:42 we get to see it but the panelists
21:44 obviously don't and so we know the whole
21:46 time how ludicrous these questions are
21:49 how close they are to guessing what
21:53 these what they do they also used to
21:55 have for about the first five to eight
21:57 years a free guess where the panelists
22:01 got to just look at them and you know
22:03 well I think you do this and I think you
22:04 didn't sometimes they got it right
22:06 and the free guest is such a bummer for
22:08 the guests because they they don't get
22:10 to play a show eventually got rid of
22:12 that because it took time up and it was
22:13 kind of a bummer if they ever got a
22:15 right
22:15 wasn't a positive thing but there's so
22:18 many elements to the show I want to
22:20 highlight to you so if you watch it
22:21 you're really cognizant of what's going
22:24 on here
22:25 the women do amazing things on this show
22:30 and even though they're being celebrated
22:32 and as soon as their career is flashed
22:34 up that the audience will a lot of times
22:36 clap and get really happy that this
22:39 woman has a great job and so it
22:43 reinforces every single Sunday night for
22:46 17 years
22:48 52 shows a year I don't think they took
22:50 a break it must be unbelievable I
22:53 haven't seen the same episode twice
22:55 except when I watch one at home and I
22:57 want my buddy at the shop to see it too
22:59 but these women are everything on the
23:02 planet from from wrestlers to scientists
23:08 to politicians from mayors to Senators
23:13 there's a woman who ends up coming in
23:16 who runs the Israeli female army I think
23:19 it's even an Air Force division you have
23:23 also in the spectrum of women that are
23:26 on the show they're not all young you
23:28 know whippersnappers you've got women of
23:31 all ages from 17 years old all the way
23:35 up into their 80s I'm gonna use their
23:39 hands women who also this is also an
23:42 interesting thing if you pay attention
23:43 when John Daly says if they're salaried
23:48 or self-employed
23:50 there's a giant probably less than 50%
23:53 but I'd say at least 35 to 40% of the
23:56 women are self-employed and that self
23:59 employed in some goofy way they're
24:00 self-employed by having created real
24:03 companies women who create food products
24:06 that are famous in the United States of
24:07 America like I said in a previous
24:08 episode there's a woman who makes horse
24:10 saddles very expensive horse saddles
24:14 right $6,500
24:17 horse saddles with like inlaid silver
24:20 and stuff you never see any this stuff
24:22 on the show but they talk about it and
24:24 John Daly will take make a point to
24:27 really
24:29 accentuate the amazing nature of some of
24:33 these jobs and there's no belittling
24:36 it's not like well it's really amazing
24:39 that you're a weak female but you have
24:40 this great job nope
24:42 John keeps it first-class the entire
24:44 time he's in his tuxedo and John will
24:46 say well you know I think it's just
24:48 amazing what you do I think what you do
24:50 is you know you know phenomenally
24:55 talented and it's just fantastic you
24:57 created a great company but he's doing
24:58 the same thing for the guys as well he
25:01 does tend to give a little bit more
25:02 compliment to the females but he doesn't
25:05 do it again in one of these wow it's
25:07 amazing you're actually a female and you
25:09 have a company it's completely opposite
25:11 tense so that the little girl is
25:12 watching in that time frame hopefully
25:16 feel like a million bucks
25:17 right there was an older woman I just
25:19 saw recently and again I've probably
25:21 only seen I'm guessing because I have no
25:24 idea I've probably only seen 25 to 30
25:28 percent of the episodes and I've been
25:30 watching this for a couple months
25:31 straight now I don't want you ever won
25:34 every single day and I'm trying to slow
25:35 down my consumption at home so I don't
25:37 outrun my buddy at the shop but there
25:40 was a woman in probably her 50s who was
25:44 a rocket engineer for Lockheed Martin
25:46 like I said in a previous episode so
25:50 think about the level of education and
25:52 acceptance and accomplishment it takes
25:54 to get that job she couldn't talk about
25:57 the Rockets that was funny because one
25:59 of the guests are one of the panelists
26:01 who likes to ask some follow-up
26:02 questions once they figure out what
26:03 their line is he asked you know can I
26:06 ask you how big this maybes even Arlene
26:09 Francis they were saying well how big
26:11 are rockets and a couple other questions
26:14 and she just said I can't tell you
26:16 classified okay right now we've seen
26:20 these these movies that have come up
26:23 recently where the there's a group of
26:25 women a group of females that worked on
26:29 the Apollo missions right and regardless
26:31 of those didn't go to the moon or didn't
26:33 go the digger to the moon it doesn't
26:34 matter those calculations were created
26:37 by these women I think I said way back
26:41 in season 1 if you want to look up the
26:42 history of
26:43 word bug being associated with bad
26:45 software it was a female technician of
26:49 one of the first artillery computers
26:51 they had for world war ii who found a
26:54 moth inside of a relay he had flown
26:57 inside the relay big old fat switch and
26:59 as the relay tried to collapse and
27:01 complete the circuit off and on it was
27:03 hitting him off body and she found it
27:06 she pulled it out and she taped it to a
27:08 piece of paper clean the switch and the
27:10 computer started working and she wrote
27:11 we got a bug in our computer and that's
27:15 where that term was invented Madame
27:19 Curie one of the premier researchers of
27:23 uranium and radiation was a female right
27:27 you guys know these stories right for
27:31 some reason we buy the propaganda that
27:33 we need these huge feminist movements to
27:36 somehow protect what was already there
27:38 to begin with right now there's an
27:41 interesting thing about this show that
27:45 has to be disclosed things were a little
27:47 bit different in the 50s things smoothed
27:50 out a little bit in the 60s but this how
27:53 block guy was a very interesting
27:56 cultural test for the show he was only
27:58 on it for three years and then he left
28:01 the show he left the show because he had
28:07 a personality that wasn't quite jiving
28:10 with the other panelists and the way
28:12 they wanted the show to feel now again
28:16 he was a comedian so he was used to
28:17 getting away with saying things probably
28:20 in nightclubs that you don't say on
28:21 national television but one of his
28:25 sticks on the show because he was a
28:27 single man was anytime a really
28:31 beautiful woman came on the show there
28:33 was always catcalls and whistles which
28:37 again wasn't frowned upon back in the
28:40 day a woman takes care of herself and
28:42 looks beautiful wears a beautiful dress
28:44 there's a couple whistles in the
28:45 audience and it wasn't like oh my god
28:46 how dare you acknowledge all my hard
28:49 work to look beautiful it was you know
28:51 you see these little smiles and grins on
28:53 the women's faces like well I did it
28:54 that really
28:55 you know impress this audience against
28:58 some women don't like this some women do
28:59 it's your choice right doesn't really
29:01 happen anymore anyway
29:03 right but how had this overtone and he
29:07 would make a lot of jokes about dating
29:09 the guests if they were beautiful
29:11 females and it it at times was sort of
29:16 palatable you could kind of go oh okay
29:19 yeah that's a funny little joke it was
29:20 usually at his expense right he was
29:22 always making the joke usually that he
29:25 didn't have a woman and because of his
29:29 own whatever frailties are in whatever
29:31 idiosyncrasies and you know would you
29:34 please date me or something like that
29:35 but towards the end towards 53 this got
29:39 a little out of hand and then almost got
29:41 out of hand to a point you're thinking I
29:43 think he's really trying to get these
29:44 girls phone number at different times in
29:48 the show the guests will either exit
29:50 behind John Daly and walk off to the
29:51 side while they walk through in front of
29:54 the guests the panelists excuse me and
29:56 shake hands with each one of them and
29:59 sometimes there's how a black guy would
30:02 kiss their hands or get a little too
30:04 frisky in that little ritual nothing
30:07 insane okay but definitely not something
30:10 that probably should have taken place
30:11 now
30:13 again when the panel settled down the
30:16 panel was Dorothy Kilgallen this Bennett
30:20 Cerf the random publishing house guy
30:24 Arlene Francis and the saw black eye
30:26 well the first three panelists are
30:29 married very successfully families and
30:32 so when they see the single guy at the
30:34 end you know it's kind of a joke to them
30:36 that he's still single but eventually he
30:39 started rubbing them wrong I don't want
30:42 to pick on mr. block too much he I
30:44 believe had a DUI or something while
30:48 traveling to Florida and he ended up
30:50 saying some foolish things while he was
30:52 drunk to the police saying he was a big
30:54 man and that you know they can't keep
30:56 him behind bars and he just had a little
30:59 moment okay
31:01 and this reached New York of course
31:04 because he's a famous guy he's as you
31:06 know you know Sunday night panelist on
31:10 What's My Line which is starting to blow
31:11 up and get really popular and eventually
31:13 there was a conversation among the other
31:18 panelists and the owners of the show and
31:20 John Daly then maybe mr. block isn't
31:23 right for the show and in one night they
31:27 let him go
31:29 Bennett Cerf took the first seat towards
31:33 John John Daly and they decided to take
31:35 the third seat which is the second one
31:38 that's introduced and pullin again and
31:40 Fred Allen and I didn't know anything
31:43 about Fred Allen Fred Allen is a
31:45 legendary comedian of which you know it
31:50 to put to put this in perspective Fred
31:52 Allen was famous back in the sort of
31:55 Charlie Chaplin days as a comedian he
31:59 was in show business just as fast as you
32:00 could get in it but the Marx Brothers
32:04 said that they actually stole material
32:06 from Fred Allen if that if you know
32:10 about the Marx Brothers that's an
32:12 amazing statement right Groucho Marx was
32:14 also a panelist several times he was a
32:17 guest several times and he actually was
32:19 one of the few people to substitute for
32:22 John Daly on the like four or five times
32:24 at 17 years that John Daly wasn't there
32:27 to host a show but think about it first
32:30 foot second year the reason why Hal
32:33 block was not invited back to the show
32:36 the catalystic event was his DUI I think
32:39 if I remember that right the reason why
32:41 he was pulled off the show is because
32:42 his his sexist remarks in 1953 this is
32:48 at a time when again a woman would walk
32:50 on stage and if she was really pretty
32:51 and young or even just pretty they'd
32:54 whistle every once a while they would as
32:57 panelists inquire as to whether or not
33:00 the beauty of a woman actually played a
33:02 role in her business whether or not she
33:03 was a model or perhaps someone who
33:05 presented or sold things using her
33:07 beauty
33:08 right they did this to the men as well
33:10 really handsome man comes on the ladies
33:13 Arlene Francis he
33:15 though she was married she was notorious
33:17 for asking and making little comments
33:19 about how you know handsome men were
33:22 she's loyally married right now that the
33:25 tragedy Paul Harvey - Hal block story is
33:30 that the poor guy died penniless in a
33:33 motel on fire somehow there was a fire
33:38 in his apartment we don't know if he
33:40 tried to commit suicide or some horrible
33:42 mishap but the poor guy died a tragic
33:44 death
33:45 so obviously was very talented to get on
33:48 the show poor guy but once he left the
33:53 show locked in Fred Allen was the
33:56 primary guest panelist until he had a
34:00 massive heart attack walking his dog in
34:03 New York City I believe in 1958 and he
34:08 had trade places with a guy named Steve
34:12 Allen and there was a lot of jokes that
34:15 they were related but they're not
34:16 related and so Steve would kind of
34:18 substitute for Fred when he was doing
34:20 Fred had his own show in fact you've
34:24 read it a couple different shows but it
34:26 was a very when Fred died mysteriously
34:29 excuse me suddenly there's a show and
34:34 you can find these by typing in what's
34:36 my line and to be like you know Fred
34:39 Alan's death or something like that
34:40 you'll see the show where they had to
34:43 sombrely announce his death and Steve
34:47 Allen had this touching moments a bit
34:50 off the theme but it's part of the
34:52 character of the show where Steve said
34:54 you know I'm oh I was always asked
34:57 whether or not Fred Allen was my father
34:59 and he paused for a second he said I
35:02 couldn't think of a better honor
35:04 if that had been the case because it's
35:07 gonna take me everything in my power to
35:09 fill his shoes and Steve Allen was had
35:12 his own show Steve Allen was the
35:14 precursor to the Johnny Carson show that
35:18 show he had the late-night show that
35:20 eventually had another guests toast and
35:23 then in Johnny Carson
35:26 but if you've ever heard the phrase is
35:28 it bigger than a breadbox that is Steve
35:32 Allen coining that question on What's My
35:34 Line it's very interesting I heard that
35:37 when I was a kid I was it is big as a
35:39 breadbox you're bigger than a breadbox I
35:41 would've fit in a breadbox all those
35:43 questions come from Steve Allen now that
35:45 may have been an old saying a long time
35:46 ago but think about it this is the 20
35:48 questions kind of questioned si4 now I'm
35:52 gonna give the full credit to Steve
35:54 Allen so one of the dimensions of giving
35:58 credit to women back in those days were
36:00 the incredible guests that came on in
36:04 their jobs and their ability to
36:06 articulate the answers to their to the
36:09 questions right those people do get
36:11 really really nervous because television
36:12 was brand new people so you'll have a
36:17 couple you know guess that'll be a
36:18 little they'll ask him a really straight
36:20 question like are you human and you'll
36:21 pause for a second you're like what are
36:23 they pausing for and they're just
36:24 nervous as hell but two of the most
36:28 profound women to ever be on the show
36:32 are the two female panelists Dorothy
36:35 Kilgallen and Arlene Francis
36:39 well Dorothy's a writer so she's very
36:41 articulate when the mystery guests come
36:44 on and they're famous well Dorothy has
36:47 the drop on him because she's got a
36:49 column if anyone's even in New York if
36:52 Frank Sinatra were to land in New York
36:54 to go to a show she immediately has him
36:57 as a potential guest on the show and
37:00 just to kind of give you the full DNA of
37:04 how this is done technically speaking
37:07 the mystery guests were never announced
37:10 of course the staff internally was kept
37:15 to like a bare minimum number of people
37:17 maybe two or three people backstage knew
37:20 who was coming that night and sometimes
37:22 they were brilliantly orchestrated and
37:27 I'll get to those in just a second but
37:28 they would be in a black limo
37:31 covered up head to toe pushed it in the
37:34 back door taking up an elevator and
37:36 pushed into the studio and their
37:38 complete secrecy
37:40 so if they ever got the guest correct it
37:45 was a big deal was real some of the
37:48 tricks they pull not again I haven't
37:49 seen all the episodes one of the tricks
37:50 I saw was brilliant was that one of the
37:52 producers of the show had taken a trip
37:56 to London and he was over there because
37:58 they had the show rebranded in all the
38:00 major countries in the world so they won
38:02 in Canada they had one in Scotland one
38:05 in Paris you know I mean it was all over
38:07 the place so he would go and visit and
38:09 kick off the shows and make sure you
38:10 know just be a present to the
38:11 franchising of the show some of the
38:14 guests guests that were mr. mystery
38:17 guests were actually other panelists
38:19 from the shows on different countries
38:20 was kind of funny but they took this
38:22 producer he was supposed to go on a
38:24 two-week trip and he came back a week
38:27 early but of course they didn't tell the
38:30 panelists that this guy came back a week
38:31 early so they hid him from any of the
38:34 communication he never came to the
38:35 studio and so that night that he came
38:36 back he was a mystery guest and of
38:40 course in their brain they think he's in
38:41 London so there's no way they're gonna
38:43 guess them but they actually ended up
38:44 figuring it out which is pretty funny
38:46 when you see the systemic breakdown of a
38:51 guest by these panelists and again I
38:55 shouldn't have to say this this is sort
38:57 of a silly thing to say oh my god these
38:59 women were so smart that's sort of a
39:01 backhanded insult to the notion that of
39:03 course they're [ __ ] smart they're
39:05 made of the same DNA that men are made
39:07 out of right - just some needs for
39:09 birthing right you know back in the day
39:14 you know they were pretty much a one-way
39:17 street for how we were attracted to each
39:19 other right
39:19 they had gay guests - I'll get to that
39:22 in a second
39:23 and there was no weird stuff okay but to
39:27 watch Dorothy break these people down
39:31 because Dorothy has a just in all my
39:36 calculations of the shows that I've seen
39:38 Dorothy and Arlene have a incredible
39:45 success rate of guessing these
39:47 professions and breaking them down and
39:49 listening and taking notes between
39:50 everyone else's questions super
39:53 analytical minds and very
39:56 three-dimensional people they're not
39:57 robots they have personalities and doors
40:00 he's very kind of conservative and sweet
40:02 and and kind of coy whereas our lean is
40:05 like SuperDuper famous and she's more
40:07 you know balumptuous' and with her
40:11 personality and she's just more like
40:13 she'll she'll quip a lot more but when
40:16 Dorothy says a joke it's even it can be
40:18 more special at some points because she
40:21 doesn't joke as much right it's just one
40:23 of those kind of dynamics right but it's
40:26 surf is this cute guy who he sort of has
40:30 that kind of New England I have a friend
40:34 of mine I think I think Bennet was
40:37 Jewish and I have a friend of mine who's
40:39 Jewish who has this same sort of speech
40:41 pattern this sort of I don't want to say
40:43 it's a speech impediment but has this
40:44 speech sort of mix between a Kennedy and
40:47 this special accent right it's just
40:49 funny how you see those things repeat
40:52 but you see utter and complete
40:54 brilliance from start to finish on this
40:56 show right so you think you know again
41:03 one of the things was that there was a
41:05 lot of controversy around being gay and
41:09 there was at times okay this Johnny ray
41:13 guy that showed up on that one episode
41:15 very handsome guy he has a little
41:20 hearing impairment his left ear poor guy
41:23 I guess in Boy Scouts was doing some
41:27 ritual and it resulted in him being
41:30 nearly deaf in his left ear and then he
41:32 had a procedure done in 1958 the 56
41:34 episode is the one that I'm talking
41:36 about he was on there again later on but
41:37 he had a procedure performed in 58 where
41:40 it nearly made him death of deaf in both
41:42 ears unfortunately but he was one of the
41:47 guests and in real life he was married
41:49 at the time and then it sort of started
41:51 coming out that he you know had a
41:53 partner it was a guy and the show didn't
41:58 care
41:58 that's the cool thing the press tried to
42:00 have a heyday with it in the outside
42:02 world but the show was like Johnny get
42:05 your ass back on this show right we love
42:08 you
42:08 don't even worry about it and that's
42:10 what's cool about this show right in the
42:11 middle of all that controversy he was
42:14 welcome back no problem
42:16 now I don't know if anyone knew Liberace
42:18 was gay but he's been on this show four
42:21 or five times I mean the guys you know
42:24 so legendary that the applause for him
42:27 is so evident that the panelists almost
42:29 know its Liberace because he walks in
42:30 the room he's that famous at the time
42:33 right but there was an episode and I
42:35 can't remember what year it was but a
42:39 transvestite came on the show a man
42:41 dressed in a dress and here's what's
42:46 interesting about it because when you
42:48 watch the show if you're like me the way
42:50 they would they frame the first shot
42:51 where they sign their name on a
42:52 blackboard now the first couple shows if
42:55 you try to go back to the beginning they
42:56 were signing a black marker on white
42:58 paper and they realized because the way
43:00 the cameras worked the white would
43:03 overwhelm the camera sensor and it was
43:06 hard to read so they switched it very
43:07 quickly to a black board which
43:10 introduced this whole logistical thing
43:11 they had to figure out a way to swap
43:13 this black board real fast and it was
43:15 brilliant how they did you'll see him do
43:16 it every once in a while but what
43:18 happens is is a hand comes in the camera
43:20 to start signing a name and one of the
43:22 things you'll notice is some of the
43:24 beautiful penmanship oh my god these
43:26 some of these people have the most
43:27 gorgeous signatures on planet earth and
43:28 just being sort of a a person who loves
43:32 calligraphy and font ography it's it's
43:35 beautiful to watch the cursive some guys
43:37 you know they're more like you know the
43:39 blue-collar guys that print their names
43:41 and it takes them forever some guys who
43:43 really old scribbled this cursive and
43:45 you can't possibly read it but John Daly
43:46 walks up and says her name perfectly
43:48 it's really funny right we're here comes
43:50 his hand in the shot and I immediately
43:52 call it out and I'm like oh that's a guy
43:54 big strong hand and but it's a woman in
43:59 a dress
44:00 I'm like oh oh okay so it's the one with
44:02 man hands okay but then the guy sits
44:04 down and you had this horrendous Adam's
44:07 apple right and I forgot what he did
44:12 as a career but it's a normal session
44:16 completely normal session and it became
44:19 an he said he was married he was from
44:21 Hollywood huh right he's on the show and
44:25 I'm watching him and I finally was like
44:27 I think that's a dude this is amazing a
44:30 guy came on a national television show
44:34 in a dress which they could have stopped
44:36 him right he was backstage before he
44:40 came in he has to send his whole his
44:42 picture he has to send his career to get
44:45 invited to the show so he's like he
44:47 randomly walked into this shell but
44:50 there he is a transvestite I went to the
44:53 comments section on YouTube people like
44:55 I think that's a dude yeah I think it is
44:57 isn't it cool how they didn't treat him
44:59 weird I treated him just like a normal
45:01 person oh my god what an idea right so
45:05 the show has all these dimensions now
45:09 some of the careers of the females that
45:10 I saw on this show that we're really
45:12 interesting is you have one old lady was
45:16 a and I say old because she was old and
45:18 she said she was was a a bank guard for
45:22 a little tiny bank in the Midwest and at
45:25 first you thinking oh these are
45:27 ceremonial roles and eventually John
45:30 Daly looks over at it cuz he was in the
45:32 military and he's from South Africa but
45:35 he's a he's from America
45:38 whatever he I guess at one point had
45:41 been some honorary deputy and he goes
45:43 looks over to her after they guess what
45:45 she is I think they find out what she is
45:48 and he says well you know do you how
45:51 many people do you haul in a year when
45:53 she was like oh something like 50 you
45:57 know so she's a real guard and you know
46:02 she's talking about mainly people
46:04 loitering or you know causing a small
46:07 ruckus it's not like a big gunfight or
46:09 you know a robber someone robbing the
46:12 bank but you get the sense that this
46:14 woman would perform just like any other
46:16 dude right eventually I saw one with
46:20 another woman probably in her late 40s
46:22 early 50s and she comes on and she
46:25 a bouncer at a bar there you go man full
46:30 spectrum from scientists to bouncer to
46:37 women who have clothing lines to women
46:40 who own their own chain of food items
46:44 right they had the guy that invented the
46:46 hula hoop who got guests in about two
46:50 two questions and then his partner came
46:53 on the next week and they couldn't get
46:55 him at all hilarious so what do we do
46:58 this information if you watch this show
47:00 and you start looking at your own past
47:03 and you start asking what grandma did
47:04 and you know because you have two
47:06 families on both sides and if you're
47:07 privileged enough to know both sides of
47:09 the family or somebody knows the history
47:11 then you can say well what a grandma do
47:14 over there doesn't matter if you're even
47:15 related to them or not
47:16 you know you'll find strong females
47:19 absolutely everywhere forever right yeah
47:23 we've had some bad eras yes we've had
47:25 moments when they couldn't vote okay and
47:28 that's really because we undid society
47:31 from being more balanced to being
47:33 imbalanced and then we rebalanced it you
47:36 know coming from the Midwest and again
47:38 looking at all these females that were
47:40 the mothers of ten to twenty kids you
47:44 know there were a lot more brutal in the
47:46 1800s with kids you know it's like you
47:47 get your ass out there and you work and
47:49 I don't hear any crap about what your
47:51 once are versus our needs as a family
47:53 right and I don't want to spend this
47:56 positive episode into something really
47:58 negative at the end so let me be as sort
48:02 of symbolic and metaphorical as I
48:03 possibly can keep this on a positive
48:06 uptick okay hopefully it's a positive
48:09 for you but we really have women divided
48:14 right now in what they want in life the
48:19 men man we still do what we want I mean
48:21 or I shouldn't say it that way
48:23 men do what they have to do and then
48:25 they do sort of what they want at the
48:27 same time same old same old we're not
48:31 allowed to be what is it the Mad Men
48:34 begin a show that showed men being
48:37 absolutely sexist slappa slappa
48:39 chicks on the ass and everything's ta
48:41 this and ta that and you have the right
48:43 to be a behave like that as a fictional
48:45 show on television I think I told you
48:48 guys a story a long time ago and I
48:50 remember what season it wasn't three
48:52 don't think my grandmother was a setting
48:55 to be a teacher and the way it used to
48:57 work was that you would go to a town and
49:00 one of the one of the homes in the town
49:03 had to house you and they would apply
49:05 with the town to do it I think they got
49:06 a subsidy for doing it so my grandmother
49:08 lived in this house with his family and
49:12 there was a cultural difference because
49:15 the family wasn't from America and I'll
49:18 just let you guess where they're from
49:19 but there was a macho n'est pas R to the
49:22 culture so part of that's responsible
49:24 for this way this gentleman behaved my
49:26 grandmother was a drop-dead brunette
49:30 gorgeous woman okay she was and the way
49:36 that the house worked was that you know
49:38 the men did their thing the women did
49:40 their thing and back in the day it was
49:41 and even went up to the point I was a
49:43 kid
49:43 the women cooked the food and cleaned it
49:47 up afterwards and then did all the other
49:48 dirty work right so it was a nice
49:50 trade-off there but they had just
49:52 finished dinner and there was the
49:56 cleanup phase and the men are all
49:57 sitting out front and this guy is the
49:59 husband of the wife of this house and he
50:02 has some male friends over and I guess
50:04 his male friends were sort of jiving him
50:07 about you know that girl that's living
50:13 with he's really pretty I bet you loved
50:17 to be with her I bet you can't be with
50:19 her and he had a little bit to drink and
50:22 this would have been 1929 as a matter of
50:25 fact my grandmother's 17 years old
50:28 already moved out of the house already
50:31 working for herself right teaching kids
50:33 and so she's cleaning up the the dishes
50:37 the wife is and there as well and this
50:40 guy comes in the kitchen and basically
50:42 grabs my grandmother's but kind of
50:46 pushes up on her right no she's a Erie
50:50 Kansas girl and
50:53 was never raised like that because they
50:55 didn't raise euros like that to take
50:57 that kind of stuff right so my
50:59 grandmother spun around and famously
51:02 punched him so hard in the nose she
51:04 broke it just troughs of blood come out
51:07 his guys face and of course he's very
51:11 angry about his buddies were laughing at
51:13 him and my grandmother told me that his
51:15 wife said thank you because that was
51:19 incredibly disrespectful to me and she
51:23 moved out of the house fairly quickly of
51:24 course but there you go
51:27 1929 my grandmother broke this guy's
51:30 nose I have seen something on the
51:33 playground as well as something in real
51:35 life but it really happened on the
51:37 playground what kids are very
51:38 impressionable and it was this game
51:41 where someone would convince someone
51:43 that they they need something that they
51:45 don't have you see it all the time today
51:48 right you need the PlayStation you need
51:49 the self when you need it the latest
51:51 cell phone you need that fancy car you
51:53 can't have a beter car you got to get
51:54 the top-of-the-line convertible whatever
51:56 right there's reality shows based on
51:59 this dilemma and we see it in a material
52:04 fashion and we kind of blow it off well
52:05 that's just that spoiled rotten kid or
52:07 bad parents or all the above for you but
52:11 I think we need to understand that it
52:13 happens at a victimization level on a
52:15 sociological level as well someone walks
52:18 up to a group of people a classification
52:20 of people group of men group of females
52:23 young females older females and they
52:27 know that there's some disadvantage and
52:31 they they lean in with an ulterior
52:35 motive to manipulate these people as
52:37 much as they possibly can and they
52:41 whisper in their ear just like the
52:42 serpent whispers into the put the
52:44 metaphorical eve bet you'd like to eat
52:48 that Apple
52:49 right that guy up there said you can't
52:53 eat this I mean who is he to say you
52:55 can't do what you want to do and he was
52:58 like I don't really care about this
52:59 Apple
53:00 I got everything else I need no but you
53:02 you don't know that this is the sweetest
53:05 fruit in this and
53:07 our garden he's keeping it from you
53:10 because he's not willing to share right
53:15 it's not a true story of course some of
53:18 you might believe it is I don't believe
53:19 it is but it's a great metaphor for how
53:22 we get manipulated in this world today a
53:24 group of people come up to you and say
53:28 what are you doing and the woman goes
53:30 what do you mean what am i doing well
53:33 you're stuck in this house raising these
53:35 kids what are you what does he think
53:38 this your husband think you're an idiot
53:40 you need to get out there and prove
53:42 yourself you know you're a smart girl
53:44 you need to do this oh I do yeah
53:49 everybody's doing it right okay what's
53:55 my line proves that was happening
53:57 naturally there was a phase where a
53:59 woman had their children raised them got
54:02 them into school and then went and got a
54:04 job these women on what's my liner
54:08 missus is most the time right their
54:10 mothers their wife's they have tons of
54:12 kids but they're still rocket designers
54:17 for Lockheed Martin right hmm now I'm
54:22 the first guy that loves to see women
54:25 break into industries they've never been
54:27 into before especially I like I'm going
54:29 into the other industries as well so
54:31 again I just think it happened naturally
54:34 but it wasn't one of these things that
54:36 was a huge emphasis I've had to personal
54:40 experiences I think I'm sure him in
54:43 previous episodes but they fit perfectly
54:45 in this episode which is the following
54:48 there was a time i I've had plenty of
54:51 conversations with people I work with
54:52 who are over 35 females right and I was
54:57 very lucky when I moved to California
54:58 the company that I joined had a female
55:01 CEO our company was at least at least
55:03 40% females in major roles CFO roles
55:09 presidential roles head of marketing
55:11 roles right they weren't taking out the
55:16 trash okay
55:18 but sometimes that have conversation
55:19 with these women and one woman had lost
55:21 the ability to have children and she
55:25 just figured this out and they said that
55:27 something had happened in her 30s that
55:28 her body changed and she was unable to
55:31 have children and I never saw a woman
55:34 sob from her soul more than that moment
55:38 probably in my life if I had it would
55:41 only be equal to but she looked at me
55:44 and she said I blew it and I was so
55:47 young I didn't really understand this I
55:49 didn't know anything about what I'm
55:50 saying right now to you he said and put
55:52 it together and she said I bought this
55:54 idea that I had to go work and prove
55:57 myself and she said in the end in the
56:00 end it hasn't been worth it no company
56:03 cares if I really exist or not any of
56:05 the accomplishments I've actually been
56:07 able to accomplish for corporate America
56:09 matter nothing to be being a mother me
56:14 having grandchildren the the true dream
56:17 that I was fighting for and becoming a
56:19 professional has just been a race by
56:22 becoming a professional this is probably
56:27 I hope a rare thing that happens but
56:31 I've heard it again on it on a radio
56:33 interview once same sort of situation
56:37 but something happened when I turned 40
56:40 and dated you know since I was probably
56:45 supposed to say 45 I dated plenty of
56:48 women who were looking to get out of the
56:53 rat race of being employed and they
56:56 wouldn't say one of them actually was
57:00 clever enough to put it into absolutely
57:03 on point word she said you know I think
57:04 I've been had and she had children right
57:07 one of them was he one of them didn't
57:09 and two of them did but she said you
57:12 know I want to stop working this is a
57:17 rat race this isn't fun and even if I
57:22 have a job I like you know the freedom
57:25 of of really living just has never
57:27 occurred because I've always had to work
57:29 and work and work my kids have had to be
57:32 have too much daycare and I didn't get
57:33 to raise them and now I have these
57:34 disconnection points with my kids
57:36 because they don't know me some of them
57:39 were fortunate enough to raise their
57:41 kids up to a certain point but divorce
57:44 would ensue and the women were out on
57:47 their own
57:48 and that was a big part of the movement
57:50 of how divorce courts were reengineering
57:52 Rockefellers in the late 70s early
57:54 eighties they were like hey if we're
57:55 gonna convince everyone to get divorced
57:57 the second that something goes wrong
57:58 then let's destroy both sides of the
58:01 family all right let's make the father
58:04 broke as a joke and then let's get the
58:07 other side of the family
58:08 hooked on consumerism and the
58:10 entitlement of all this money now
58:13 obviously women need money to help raise
58:15 kids but the amount of women in my world
58:19 including my own mom that it didn't
58:22 really get the financial support that
58:24 they needed we survived all right we
58:29 didn't take big giant bank loans to pay
58:31 our bills we just live with a little bit
58:33 less right it takes a really long time
58:36 for society to ever reach any level of
58:38 balance right and there's all kinds of
58:41 categories of balance you know you look
58:45 at America by 1960 we had balanced the
58:49 educational system to crank out just
58:51 infinite supplies of Awesomeness in
58:53 every category education obviously as as
58:57 proven by what's my line for females and
58:59 males tremendous levels of
59:03 self-employment it was being
59:05 self-employed in the 60s was your choice
59:07 I I would rather work for myself than
59:10 for a corporation because then it
59:11 matters me working for myself and not
59:15 spending time every minute with my kid
59:16 well now it kind of matters and by the
59:18 way I can bring my children into my own
59:20 company I can pay them there's their
59:22 their chore money or their allowance
59:26 through work for our company I think we
59:29 had balance in the family as well I
59:31 think we had fairly a good balance for
59:34 folks that were homosexual and didn't
59:37 want to have any families at all or
59:38 maybe they did and they just wanted to
59:39 stay what they were there was a balance
59:41 there the way society treated people was
59:45 it the
59:45 to the world all the time like it is
59:48 today because people are swooping in
59:51 today like the serpent the story of the
59:53 serpent and saying don't you want this I
59:57 think you need more representation here
60:00 I think you're being treated poorly here
60:02 and they emphasize things that don't
60:04 really have the intent that they have
60:06 now always always always there's the
60:08 jerk there's a community that doesn't
60:10 accept you know forget almost sexuality
60:13 they don't accept race blending they
60:15 don't accept women doing certain things
60:17 or men doing certain things or whatever
60:19 so there's always gonna be plenty of
60:21 things you can cite but I think in the
60:24 overall mean algorithm of at least
60:28 America I can't speak for other
60:29 countries we've had beautiful balances
60:32 at times and I think we've I think that
60:38 we've lost it and I think that there has
60:40 been a sort of Renaissance from both
60:44 sexes of both orientations to get
60:48 regained the balance that we used to
60:50 have one of the episodes I did was
60:54 called the death of chivalry and it's
60:58 about my journey through chivalry by
61:00 growing up in the Midwest where chivalry
61:02 is a demanded attribute of a man as well
61:07 as a woman and sort of the degradation
61:10 of where we are today and I never
61:12 received more compliments and private
61:15 messages from females than from that
61:17 episode where people said even women in
61:19 my personal circles who were listening
61:21 to the show at the time they made an
61:22 effort to get my face and tell me I
61:26 loved that episode because you're right
61:29 when I was young we used to have it and
61:32 now we don't have it and you know some
61:35 people are like you know what some of
61:38 the dudes came back to me and said you
61:39 know what you're right I was raised with
61:41 it for whatever reason I overlooked it
61:43 but I'm getting back into it some of the
61:45 dudes said you know what I would never
61:46 let go of it and I love the response
61:49 from a woman when I hold the door and
61:51 she acknowledges me and I don't even
61:52 know her
61:53 I never ever see her again in my life
61:55 I'm in Los Angeles California our paths
61:57 will never cross
61:59 there's no ulterior motive to get
62:00 anything out of it I think that's pretty
62:03 cool don't you go watch what's my line
62:07 it's on YouTube there's a channel call
62:09 what's my line subscribe to it I will
62:12 tell you that there are other game shows
62:13 unfortunately they're cross-pollinating
62:15 into the channel and so we have other
62:19 shows like what's my secret is one of
62:21 the shows I think that Fred Allen hosted
62:24 Fred Allen has other show as well which
62:26 is super weird show given away cartons
62:28 of cigarettes some of the episodes
62:31 actually have the old 50s ads and I'll
62:33 tell you those are jewels those are
62:35 usually early 50 ads and then the reason
62:37 why this show got pulled back into
62:39 digital forms because the game show
62:41 network which was a little experiment
62:44 they did in the late 90s early 2000s was
62:48 trying to use these old shows and then
62:51 create online games you could play and
62:54 you know they try to cross pong it was
62:56 complete failure but at least they got
62:58 these shows we headed but they'll have
63:00 like weird commercial breaks that have a
63:03 couple frames of some modern thing and
63:05 then it slips back into the show just
63:06 just overlook it very few get really
63:09 super sloppy but ladies have a look have
63:14 a look at the truth that you were
63:16 celebrated that you didn't have any
63:18 problems finding amazing freaking jobs
63:21 and being amazing human beings back in
63:23 those days it's all a lie it's all a
63:26 complete lie and I think most of you
63:28 know it is if you have any relatives
63:29 that you're familiar with their past and
63:32 again again let's just say it together
63:35 raising a family is the most incredible
63:38 amazing job it's the hardest job that
63:41 any human being male or female could
63:43 ever accomplish for hundreds if not
63:47 thousands if not hundreds of thousands
63:49 of years the female has been the expert
63:51 at the most complex amazing job on
63:54 planet Earth not to mention carrying the
63:58 child for nine months right a skinny one
64:00 who's a week from giving birth how much
64:03 they want to carry that child anymore
64:04 right there Legos get this thing out of
64:05 me right us amazing males and this we've
64:10 had a gallbladder attack for five hours
64:12 for nine months straight we have no idea
64:14 what childbirth is like right we don't
64:18 so my hope is that you'll take this
64:21 episode as one of celebrating the utter
64:24 complete power of being a female without
64:27 any victimization without any oh I'm so
64:31 sorry you know you're dumb or or the
64:35 other one which is it's amazing you have
64:37 a job given that you're a female right
64:40 let's flush all that down the drain we
64:44 need to rebuild society from the ground
64:46 up and this is one of the things we
64:48 gotta fix right you guys get to have it
64:51 all right women you get to carry a child
64:53 get to raise a child and you get to have
64:55 the job of your dreams you really do
64:57 dudes we don't get at least one of those
65:01 right being a little tongue-in-cheek but
65:05 hopefully you can get the overall point
65:06 of what I'm trying to say anyway I know
65:10 you feel me if you haven't been to deep
65:12 thoughts radio.com please go throughout
65:15 the audio video lock Facebook group
65:16 patreon pages I've added a store for now
65:19 and we'll see if that stays so if you go
65:21 there it's not there Ian's because it's
65:22 probably real old episode but the world
65:25 has changed anyway take care of yourself
65:29 and someone else and I'll see you in the
65:31 next deep thoughts over now
