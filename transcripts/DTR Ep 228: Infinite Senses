00:00 [Music]
00:32 good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and
00:35 welcome back to deep thoughts today's
00:38 episode is about our senses they say we
00:43 have five senses what our senses well
00:48 the most generic definition of our
00:50 senses they are defined as the
00:55 mechanisms by which we are alive and
00:58 since that we are live and confirm that
01:01 we are alive without them we are nothing
01:05 so I work in virtual reality
01:09 not like you see it in the mass
01:12 audiences with headsets that [ __ ]
01:15 give you headaches and all that [ __ ] but
01:17 I'm inventing a brand new form of
01:19 virtual reality which hopefully you will
01:22 experience and so we are constantly
01:26 doing little experiments to figure out
01:31 what is reality because if we are to
01:35 replace it I mean truly replace it for
01:40 an entertainment experience or an
01:42 educational experience one has to know
01:45 what one is talking about I have spent
01:48 years studying how you know light enters
01:53 the eyeball how all of the different
01:57 chains of command from you know photon
02:00 to chemical to electron to chemical to
02:04 electron you know pathways in the brain
02:07 in order to recognize sight then various
02:11 mechanisms
02:12 3d sound what makes a person believe
02:15 something is behind the verses in front
02:17 of them and it you know it goes far
02:20 deeper than left-right panning front
02:24 rear painting it's intense but so on one
02:29 side of the fence I've got all this
02:30 technology that I'm working on with a
02:33 bunch of other brilliant people and then
02:36 on the other side I have this show where
02:41 I get the privilege of really discussing
02:45 sort of the esoteric nature of being
02:48 alive
02:49 we philosophy on this show right I say
02:55 we because I say something then you say
02:57 something that I say something and it
03:00 just goes a little slower than a normal
03:01 conversation because it takes me you
03:04 know several hours to make an episode
03:06 and get it edited up there but then you
03:07 guys reply then I'll make a video
03:09 replying to you and if anyone were to
03:12 term it well if anyone were to pay very
03:15 close attention to the way the show is
03:17 gone and have a meticulous nature to
03:21 them from the maybe at the very first
03:24 episode that that was kind of catching
03:26 on the first couple of uh suppose you're
03:27 catching on
03:29 and then you study what I'm saying and
03:32 what the comments say and then what I'm
03:34 saying with the comments saying there's
03:36 a there is a three-dimensional
03:38 relationship going on between this show
03:40 and listeners and that's very common for
03:42 shows that are watched but I think that
03:46 the weight and the value of the comments
03:50 from you guys are it feels like graduate
03:55 school doesn't it we're having really
03:57 good conversations join us but we were
04:02 doing an experiment three days ago
04:05 actually two days ago in our office up
04:09 north just four of us in a room it's
04:13 been four of us working together for
04:15 about ten months and my partner and I my
04:19 business partner and I he and I have
04:22 been at it for another eight months
04:24 before that for a very specific
04:25 invention
04:26 the prior to that I've been a
04:28 virtual-reality all the way back to 1982
04:32 it was actually from 1990 and 1992
04:37 I had a separate gig in Southern
04:38 California I went to Northern California
04:39 came back to Southern and now finally
04:42 they're throwing billions of dollars at
04:44 that industry even though most the
04:46 solutions are atrocious nevertheless
04:49 we're here but one of my partner's was
04:52 trying to get us to understand the
04:56 mind's eye and he puts his hands over
04:59 his eyes and he wants us all to do it
05:01 and he says you know I want you to
05:04 envision a billion dollars and so we're
05:09 all kind of sitting there going all
05:10 right okay yeah sure and then he says
05:13 what image did you come up with that
05:14 most of us were like pile of cash stack
05:18 of cash but was it a billion dollars and
05:20 we said not really because we can't
05:22 imagine a billion dollars like
05:24 accurately right he says do it again
05:28 close your eyes they give you another
05:29 goal he says envision it goes up try to
05:33 envision a gold ingot do you have a
05:37 vision for a gold ingot we're all like
05:39 yeah yeah yeah you go see you have the
05:42 ability to see things that you can
05:44 conceive of but you can't see things you
05:45 can't conceive of right now that was a
05:49 neat experiment we were doing but what
05:53 happened to me was unrelated but not
05:56 directly related which was utterly
05:59 astonishing to me and it was only
06:02 because I noticed it vividly and I was
06:06 able to put words to it this is kind of
06:09 a neat thing don't do this if you're
06:10 driving wait till you get home but while
06:14 I had my hands over my eyelids to really
06:17 reduce the light our Studios a film
06:20 studio it's being used for scientific
06:24 research but I noticed that I could see
06:27 with my eyes closed
06:29 to a degree I felt like my utter
06:37 presents to my body was that I could see
06:42 with my epidermis now if you think about
06:47 the rods and cones in your eye you're
06:50 talking about a set of cells that have
06:53 various properties various functions
06:57 when photons bang into them and that you
07:01 know that compresses a chemical
07:03 structure inside them which then gets
07:05 reported again through electrons back to
07:07 your brain and then we metabolize it
07:10 into sight and the interesting thing was
07:14 is for this for the first time in my
07:16 life I sat there with my fingers over my
07:20 eyes and I felt like I could totally see
07:22 my nose I could see my hands I could see
07:24 things and you know for those of you are
07:26 into neurology and sort of a holographic
07:28 universe my mind does have a
07:31 3-dimensional perception of itself
07:33 that's why you get phantom pain and four
07:36 limbs that are missing or something like
07:38 that but this is a little different I
07:40 felt like I could see color and light
07:43 and way beyond what leaks through your
07:45 eyelids but remember I'm putting my
07:47 fingers over my eyelids which if you
07:48 haven't done that in your lifetime it's
07:50 really dark outside of putting some sort
07:54 of mechanical device over your eyes to
07:56 block light you know the other one is to
07:58 put the palm of your hand over your eyes
08:01 which is just really dark as it's thick
08:04 right but it dawned on me for a second
08:08 that my epidermis made of just
08:12 absolutely infinitely dense mesh of
08:15 capillaries which is you know where your
08:17 blood goes from blue to red we're good
08:19 it's oxygenated they also sense
08:21 temperature right so if I poke you with
08:25 a hot thing or a cold thing it's your
08:27 epidermis your skin that figures it out
08:29 and then shocks and pulls back the
08:31 muscle right and of course when you
08:34 stick inside the body there's other
08:37 things inside the body which will help
08:38 you out but I really honestly believe
08:40 that the epidermis is 95% of all pain
08:44 related to puncture wounds I think the
08:47 inside the body is been designed to be
08:50 pretty
08:51 painless because then we might live in a
08:53 little too much aches and pains takes
08:57 quite a bit to create a pain internally
08:59 goldstone or a kidney stone or something
09:04 but I thought about thinking okay the
09:08 mind knows how to metabolize energy into
09:10 sight the mind knows how to metabolize
09:14 energy into sound touch right all of our
09:21 senses are the interpolation of energy
09:27 into the brain cavity into a Gestalt II
09:30 kind of image a projector inside your
09:32 head
09:35 now we're going to get into soul I'm
09:38 just trying to go the the old kurtzweil
09:40 realm first and it just you know at
09:47 first it just dawned on me that my body
09:49 could be reusing various organs to
09:52 substitute for other organs and you know
09:55 I'm not blind it wasn't like I spent
09:57 hours and days and months not being able
09:59 to see all the sudden I felt like my
10:02 body my skin was an eyeball now the
10:07 other thing is I have a pretty good
10:08 visual memory so you know when you close
10:11 your eyes you say look at this now close
10:12 your eyes now think about what you see
10:14 it's an interesting exercise because
10:17 your mind's eye will take a Polaroid
10:19 snapshot of what you're looking at and
10:21 put it inside your head but the soda
10:24 starts to fade away morph into something
10:29 else and then the second thing occurred
10:33 to me which is why have I not had this
10:35 thought before and why hasn't anyone
10:40 ever suggested that this could happen
10:43 ever to me in my lifetime why is it that
10:47 when it took the movie Sixth Sense to
10:51 really bring up the conversation to
10:53 average society that there are five
10:55 senses and that the reason why this
10:57 movie is interesting is because it has a
10:59 sixth sense seeing dead people
11:02 the longer we are alive the more our
11:05 brains and our minds and our and our
11:07 perception of reality gets closed if we
11:10 do not take an active role in holding
11:13 open the blast doors like all those
11:16 sci-fi movies where someone's you know
11:18 got a hold open a door so everyone can
11:22 escape that door is trying to shut the
11:27 more that you ingest mass media of any
11:32 kind movies television think about it
11:36 they tell you how things are and you
11:40 must accept it
11:41 to be accepted into the tribe of people
11:44 who watch TV a god-awful tribe to be
11:47 part of think about all the courses
11:51 they're in school in college there are
11:53 courses about a bona fide subject boom
11:56 math religion only if you dabble in a
12:02 little bit of philosophy are you going
12:06 to get close to some professor somewhere
12:08 in the world encouraging you to expand
12:11 your mind the Arts in America at least I
12:16 can't speak for any other country are
12:17 horrible because the people that are
12:21 becoming teachers have no artistic
12:22 skills and so the K through six are
12:27 guessing mu is five now fifth grade here
12:30 in America there's no education on art
12:33 because the teachers can't do anything
12:36 it can't even draw a turkey with their
12:38 hand for [ __ ] sake and so the game is
12:41 to get your kid inside a box as quickly
12:44 as possible right
12:45 now some of you are saying you're
12:48 legitimately itemizing the kids who are
12:51 you know your sort of social justice
12:54 warriors if they they have I think
12:58 they've crawled into a fascism box a
13:02 racism box a hate box but you think
13:06 about if you've been in the military
13:07 before you know what boot camp can do to
13:09 a punk ass kid break your [ __ ] down and
13:14 build you back up to be an adult
13:16 which is why I think that you know I've
13:19 had I've never been against the idea of
13:22 you know going in and doing a mandatory
13:24 year of military service to your country
13:27 I think that would be fabulous with the
13:31 census think about it
13:33 how important is this conversation well
13:38 I'm talking about the very collection of
13:42 data inputs that give you the sense of
13:47 who you are as a person
13:48 the more data inputs you have the more
13:52 of a person you can become less data
13:55 well you start becoming a human robot
13:58 our ruski brothers the Russians across
14:02 the pond and their educational system
14:05 they require the most rounded food group
14:10 of categories for you to learn before
14:13 you're allowed to graduate school at
14:16 least they used to but you were to
14:20 engage the Arts in a musical level on a
14:23 physical level of some sort you can do
14:25 dance or some other things you were to
14:27 paint you were to draw you were to learn
14:31 a science you were to learn economics
14:35 and I'm sure there's areas of Russia
14:37 that don't have such privileges but for
14:40 the areas where they are they are at
14:41 their best this is what you're supposed
14:43 to learn and that's to round out the
14:46 mind you ever study samurais you know I
14:51 feel like when I talk about samurai data
14:54 it feels like Hollywood and video games
14:56 have so sensationalized this into almost
14:59 folklore as if they didn't exist but
15:01 they did exist and the history on them
15:03 is actually pretty solid
15:04 I always feel silly though but they were
15:08 to write poetry they were to be
15:10 botanists they were to engage the
15:14 fragile as much as they were to engage
15:17 the unthinkable physical they were to be
15:22 political they were to understand
15:25 philosophy the rhyme and reason why they
15:29 exist
15:30 was to be driven down inside their minds
15:33 where is that today what college has a
15:40 curriculum that even cares that you get
15:43 the most 3-dimensional thought process
15:46 developed to analyze on a second to
15:49 second basis who you are as a being when
15:52 that is truly if anything what you are
15:56 forget the I'm a mailman I'm a fireman
15:59 I'm a doctor at first you're a being we
16:06 are in an era of humanity where the
16:10 second one gets bored being a being they
16:14 run into a telephone and just sit there
16:17 for [ __ ] hour scrolling and clicking
16:20 and getting into arguments with people
16:24 posting absolute drivel drivel comes in
16:28 10 colors but now what if I said to you
16:31 this argument in this
16:33 I shouldn't say argument but this area
16:35 of conversation which is the census I
16:39 should say are the census we are babies
16:45 we are infants we are children most of
16:50 us the Guru's and the Buddhist monks
16:56 they are not children they if anything
17:00 are the closest thing that we've ever
17:02 metabolized up or raised into an adult
17:06 when it comes to the bean that we are
17:10 there's a very interesting reality and
17:12 it's very simple that if I said look I
17:16 want you to wash one car and you say
17:21 alright you wash one car I'll say how
17:24 was that experience what did you learn
17:26 no cars you're dirty man yet you know
17:30 Don dishwashing liquid is kind of good
17:33 for this I didn't never thought about it
17:35 and then I say okay now wash a thousand
17:37 cars 10,000 cars hundred thousand cars
17:41 I guarantee you up to ten thousand cars
17:44 if I said what have you learned about
17:47 washing a car your answer to me is going
17:50 to be philosophical about yourself most
17:53 likely because you were doing something
17:56 over and over and over again and you
18:00 were bored several times throughout the
18:02 process and so in order to eclipse the
18:05 boredom you had to turn the car wash
18:09 into a ballet into a kata into something
18:13 that was absolutely spiritually
18:16 congruent with your being if you were to
18:20 be up and dedicate say 16 hours a day
18:24 just to get through your 10,000 as
18:25 quickly as possible you're going to
18:28 optimize the entire process to get cars
18:33 done quicker at the same time you're
18:35 probably going to increase the accuracy
18:36 of doing it it will become a much more
18:40 intense experience and when you get done
18:45 when you get done you will have gone
18:46 through a spiritual process your senses
18:51 will be utterly and completely
18:53 heightened how you get tired when you
18:56 get tired how you sleep how you wake up
18:58 when and where you eat how you hold a
19:03 sponge with your hand and that's why I
19:06 think that the more that we engage the
19:10 metrics of being alive a lot more things
19:12 can happen now let me just you know
19:18 overlay on top of this car analogy what
19:20 I'm really talking about here what do we
19:23 say about things that we do over and
19:25 over and over again one of the little
19:26 catch phrases which i think is very
19:27 accurate is rinse and repeat go back to
19:33 zero and do it again go back to zero
19:35 and do it again all right what is every
19:40 day of your life what is every day of
19:45 your life what do you do 365 times
19:48 before the Sun circles are the earth
19:52 circles the Sun right
19:54 you live life every single day now what
19:59 if I came up to you and I said I can
20:02 prove to you that you're much bigger
20:05 than a human being you're much more
20:08 intricate than a human being when you
20:11 say what are you talking about
20:14 so go well let's go through the exercise
20:16 slowly and I say who are you what are
20:18 you don't worry about your name
20:22 don't worry about the job that you're in
20:23 where you live just tell me as if I am
20:26 an alien visiting from another world and
20:29 I'm I can't quite be there to assess it
20:33 myself but you have to tell me what you
20:34 are perhaps it's just a radio
20:36 conversation with an alien but what are
20:39 you how are you able to answer that
20:42 question well you're going to reach into
20:46 the pool of senses that you recognize
20:48 and you're going to eyes it back to the
20:50 person on the other line and provided
20:53 they have some mechanism to understand
20:55 what you're saying and your language is
20:57 rich and deep and thorough they'll be
21:00 able to paint a picture of you on the
21:01 other side and determine whether or not
21:04 visiting you is a good idea douglas
21:09 adams had a great story about am a race
21:12 of people that were offended by a human
21:15 and they tore across the universe to
21:18 invade and get revenge and as soon as
21:22 they got here they got swallowed by a
21:23 dog because the one thing they failed to
21:27 calculate was scale I thought that was
21:30 [ __ ] brilliant but the analogy of
21:33 talking to an alien over a radio station
21:35 or something is really analogy of you
21:38 talking to yourself and recognizing what
21:40 you are inside the brain and then again
21:44 we'll spend the second half going into
21:46 sole relationships here but inside the
21:48 brain there are neurons that are taking
21:50 on certain responsibilities they have at
21:54 least mapped you know the surface of the
21:57 brain with various organs in your body
22:00 and if you have ever seen that really
22:02 weird graphic of a brain where the hands
22:05 are a giant portion of your brain
22:08 there's so much articulation and things
22:09 going on and as each limb is barely used
22:12 the quadrant of the brain that is
22:15 assigned to that area of your body is
22:19 very minimal right but I told one of my
22:23 partners this and it just struck me as
22:26 something I need to say on the show I
22:28 got this is the first person's never set
22:31 it and it's pretty obvious to all of you
22:35 which is the following every day we are
22:38 alive the world is trying to close our
22:43 minds every day that's just a statement
22:48 based on the natural attrition that
22:51 happens to human being who is not taking
22:53 control of themselves once you take
22:57 control of yourself stop polluting your
22:59 third eye with fluoride and mercury and
23:01 aluminum stop eating food that is
23:04 telling your body not to procreate you
23:08 reverse the process instead of seeing it
23:13 shrink you see it expand and it can
23:18 expand in a really linear fashion which
23:20 is growth at a constant rate or you can
23:23 see an exponential explosion of growth
23:28 which might peter out and come back down
23:31 but nevertheless you grow let's cross
23:35 the pond now and bring in the soul as a
23:40 mechanism here I was listening to all my
23:43 partner's discuss the brain and the
23:46 subject of memories came into the
23:48 conversation he says you know we don't
23:49 know where all this stuff goes and I'm
23:52 just sitting there going it's your soul
23:54 it goes into the database of the
23:57 universe through your soul your soul is
23:59 you and you have infinite access to the
24:02 entire database of all knowledge in the
24:04 universe to the degree you have the
24:06 ability to articulate what you are
24:08 looking for you can send the little
24:10 robotic arm down the hallway to grab the
24:12 tape and bring it to you for what you're
24:14 looking for
24:16 sometimes the query has to be rewritten
24:18 several times within a split second
24:21 when you're asking the universe for an
24:22 answer you might be embittered ambiguous
24:26 and it doesn't understand you and so you
24:29 have to say it again what I always
24:30 imagine is there's someone on the other
24:32 side listening to me trying to make
24:33 sense of it all and they're not
24:35 necessarily gotten like God likes our
24:38 relatives help us out
24:39 it keeps the game kind of fun right
24:41 whatever but I'll put out four more
24:45 query if it's good I get it right away
24:47 if I'm being vague I don't get it if I
24:49 reclassify I get it it's interesting you
24:52 know we talked about the five senses and
24:53 then we all kind of have fun with
24:55 everything over five so six could be
24:58 seen dead people six could be seeing
24:59 auras seeing the future
25:02 it's a bunch of different stuff right
25:05 and it's all arbitrary in terms of how
25:08 we divide it up and consider one a
25:11 different category than the other but
25:14 how would the soul play a role when it
25:17 comes to the senses one of the things
25:23 you run into real quickly when you try
25:25 to be very pragmatic about the soul
25:27 because there's an e throw conversation
25:28 we can have about the soul which is to
25:30 keep it very sort of mysterious and
25:32 cloud-like and then we can talk about
25:34 its generalities and that sort of thing
25:36 which we're going to get to in this
25:37 episode but for those of you who are
25:39 more scientific you're more
25:42 scientifically prone you're pragmatic
25:43 you're looking at it saying well how
25:45 does it actually connect to my body
25:47 that's sort of a question I'd like to
25:49 answer before I go any further in
25:51 believing it exists for me it has to do
25:54 with a couple different thought
25:56 processes perhaps it is a very
26:00 mechanical well explained attachment and
26:02 that it connects perhaps to the base of
26:04 your spine your spinal cord you know a
26:08 giant squid has essentially a spinal
26:10 cord as a brain it's a tube about the
26:13 size of your pinky when this thing squid
26:15 50 feet long okay
26:17 its brain is about as big as my pinky
26:18 and it's a hollow tube right again
26:22 there's theories that they're they're
26:23 neurons are actually in their limbs but
26:25 then you can cut off a limb of a squid
26:28 and the lower back I believe that's the
26:32 case right
26:34 but the other one is to say what if you
26:39 go back to my gravity episode about
26:40 ether o winds being gravity which i
26:43 think is absolutely [ __ ] conclusive
26:46 you have the analogy of a current a
26:50 vortex corn current in a river you know
26:54 rivers go downstream and they hit
26:56 obstacles like bridge supports and they
26:58 spin water and you create a current and
27:00 you can swim in that it'll suck you to
27:01 the bottom you can die but as long as
27:04 you stay out there majestic when your
27:06 bathtub drains same situation imagine
27:09 this I get you to understand it's really
27:13 just water but because water behaves in
27:15 a certain way we give it designations
27:17 the water has a wave water has a drain
27:20 right now when water could be rain it
27:25 could be a storm it could be a cloud
27:26 it's [ __ ] water in the end it's
27:28 exactly what the universe is like except
27:31 it's ìiî particles now if you're in that
27:34 River you're standing there looking at
27:37 and I'm pointing this out and you get it
27:39 and you're cool and I take a big bucket
27:41 of red dye and I dump it in the water
27:43 upstream here comes as blood-red cloud
27:47 coming down the river and it hits that
27:49 that vortex some of it goes past the
27:53 vortex most of it goes down and within a
27:56 few minutes all that red dye goes down
27:58 inside the vortex spins out the bottom
28:00 and then continues downstream and within
28:03 a couple seconds after that it was as if
28:05 I never put any dye in the river at all
28:07 so for maybe what sticks to the pylon
28:09 from the bridge so the question is is
28:12 what is the movement model of the soul
28:14 in relation to the body one would assume
28:18 that the soul has some movement given
28:21 that all the people that have had
28:22 near-death experiences typically have
28:25 some discussion of movement through the
28:26 universe they hover over their bodies
28:28 they go up tunnels they float to the
28:31 center of the universe those who smoked
28:33 DMT definitely go towards the center of
28:36 the universe there's some movement the
28:39 hindus talk about the out-of-body
28:41 experiences in which one is connected to
28:43 the body to the silver cord
28:47 first time ever smoked salvia
28:49 I was like a very small percentage don't
28:52 even know maybe 25% or whatever it was I
28:54 smoked it in a second I smoked it I felt
28:57 like I had a bar going through the
28:59 bottom of my chin out the top of my
29:01 forehead and it felt like a silver pipe
29:05 most bizarre thing we did not feel like
29:08 a cord it felt like I had a swingset
29:09 pull in my head now some of you might be
29:12 asking why am I believe during the
29:14 connection between the soul and the body
29:16 that is because in the first part of
29:18 this conversation with the five senses
29:21 that we are raised to believe in it is a
29:24 very hardcore black-and-white reality
29:26 for us when it comes to the souls
29:30 relationship well we only have confident
29:33 men who believe their own [ __ ] when
29:37 it comes to the soul like yours truly we
29:40 believe that we have seen things that
29:41 are irrefutable that then kind of give
29:44 away the imagery of how the soul might
29:46 work but now there's this sort of again
29:50 it's the last thing I'm going to say
29:51 hopefully on the pragmatic side of this
29:53 conversation which is I do not believe
29:56 that ether winds necessarily inspire the
30:00 soul it could be that the soul inspires
30:03 ether winds or vice versa it could be
30:06 that when a certain anomaly happens in
30:08 Heathrow winds they behave in a current
30:11 that we might call life the soul has an
30:15 opportunity to participate in that
30:17 structure and give it its own sense of
30:20 identity but there is a sliver of
30:24 thought out there that every single
30:25 thing in the universe is alive and
30:28 simply because it can't communicate with
30:30 you on your terms we poopoo it out of
30:35 existence which i think is a very sad
30:37 idea now it would seem that there might
30:40 be some correlations between the soul
30:42 and the body let me give you some ideas
30:47 when you feel guilty there's this weird
30:49 biological thing that falls upon you
30:51 when you feel sad there is a weird
30:54 biological thing that falls upon you
30:56 when you are thrilled to death
30:59 your body exudes this amazing journal
31:03 and dopamine what have you now the
31:06 scientific side they simply say this is
31:08 the result of those chemical stimulants
31:11 in your mind and we have to absolutely
31:13 positively acknowledge the drugs are
31:16 capable of creating all those emotions
31:20 everything on the color wheel of emotion
31:22 drugs have been designed to give it to
31:24 you from straight-up suicidal depression
31:26 all the way up to euphoric being one
31:29 with the universe
31:30 those exist we know they do so why would
31:34 the soul be involved with anything it's
31:38 because there are things that are
31:39 unexplained that we believe we have
31:43 triangulated the existence of a soul
31:45 again like I set out about experiences
31:48 me believing that I've met Walt Disney
31:50 who tells me where Bob ger is in the
31:52 parks I can walk right up to them and
31:53 say hello that doesn't make any sense in
31:57 a kurtzweil model at all but let me ask
32:01 you a question here what do you think is
32:04 important that we must assert onto the
32:06 conversation it can be in a relevant
32:09 conversation or sorry question at the
32:11 same time so let me give you all of the
32:13 three options that I think we can
32:15 discuss here if there's a soul is it the
32:21 body they acknowledge is the soul that
32:23 gives us feeling and senses and
32:25 consciousness it is the soul is it the
32:28 soul that has to acknowledge the body to
32:32 create our consciousness and all forms
32:34 of input or are they disjointed things
32:39 that just happened to perform together
32:42 to create consciousness as almost a
32:46 mistake or some interesting relationship
32:50 you know when you see a whale swim in
32:52 the ocean they have all these little
32:53 fish that swim you know stuck to them
32:56 barnacles and fishes swim by it because
32:58 it's the Big Daddy they aren't the same
33:01 creature as far as I know but they swim
33:05 together as if they are why is it that
33:09 folks to get into this kind of stuffs
33:10 tend to get very spiritual
33:13 and they get very calm and they tend not
33:15 to worry about death they tend to get
33:19 closer to the concept of reincarnation
33:21 they tend to lose their organized
33:23 religion not reading I don't you know
33:26 lose their belief in God that they just
33:31 simply let go a little bit of all the
33:32 paradigms that they've been taught
33:34 mothers who have amazing connections
33:36 with their children even though their
33:38 children on the other side of Planet the
33:41 children gets in harm the mother feels
33:43 it the mother makes the phone call and
33:45 the kid says oh my god yeah that just
33:47 happened to me this is this thing - that
33:49 severity that you were warned about
33:53 relatives who die they come and visit us
33:55 so I'm on the other side I'm alright all
33:59 these experiences in the end you wake up
34:03 every day and you are what you are but
34:08 the problem with me saying any phone
34:09 with that is that it sort of insinuates
34:13 and suggests that you immediately
34:16 quantify your existence and certain you
34:19 know I take up this much space I'm 5
34:22 foot 10 and pop up I weigh this much and
34:25 all this other stuff and it tends to
34:29 lock you in a box now if you woke up and
34:32 I had a little thing that said you know
34:35 you are one with the universe at all
34:37 times you simply don't know it but it is
34:42 your journey and being alive to know it
34:45 to feel it a hundred percent but I'm not
34:49 giving you the manual on how to figure
34:51 it out I'm going to give you pamphlets
34:54 brochures tiny little things that
34:57 suggest where you need to start your
34:59 treasure hunt for who you are you could
35:03 go up to a Tibetan temple spend 10 20
35:05 years they are going to be authorities
35:07 on the subject matter you can go to talk
35:10 to various Hindu Indu gurus preferably
35:14 the ones that aren't that famous taking
35:16 money from thousands of people that they
35:19 will advance your thinking further in
35:23 the end you get rewarded with a
35:25 three-dimensional version of yourself
35:26 you never imagined but even me saying
35:28 three dimensions is robbing you of all
35:31 the dimensions that you would get you
35:35 know since we really discovered that the
35:36 world is being manipulated quite a bit
35:38 by banking institutions we have had the
35:42 phrase coined into our lexicon which is
35:44 hidden in plain sight I like that I like
35:48 that whole thing because that is the
35:50 best way to hide anything in the world
35:52 this is in plain sight once you try to
35:54 get a complex location to hide something
35:56 then it becomes more trivial and obvious
35:58 to those who think deviously about where
36:01 one might hide something what if what we
36:06 truly are is hidden in plain sight it's
36:11 hidden right under our nose the movie
36:15 branded of which I mentioned every 10
36:17 episodes or so is a brilliant episode
36:19 and it's a movie it's an indie movie
36:22 filmed in Russia I believe it really
36:25 shows how there could be okay this alien
36:29 race that essentially feeds on man's
36:32 lust for objects and because that is
36:36 what what they feed on they create
36:39 objects that we must lust for and the
36:42 way it was portrayed best in the film
36:43 was that a little fat boy little Gustus
36:46 Klum kid wanted some ice cream and his
36:49 mother was a weakling that couldn't tell
36:51 him no and she takes enough to get the
36:54 ice cream and there's a sub alien is
36:57 connected to the back of his neck the
36:58 base of his neck which is a very soul
37:00 body ish right we mentioned the base of
37:03 the neck because that is one of the kill
37:05 points for the human body that is
37:07 absolute you break your brainstem you
37:10 are dead
37:11 doesn't matter what else happens you
37:13 break that thing you shut the [ __ ] off
37:15 all right so they connect this thing's
37:18 this little fat boy's body and he walks
37:20 up to get his ice cream and the second
37:21 that he gets the ice cream and takes a
37:24 lick of it he no longer has the lust
37:26 algorithm going so the little alien
37:30 snips off from his neck naturally and
37:32 floats up to the mother brand which is
37:35 where whoever whatever brand made the
37:37 ice cream happen
37:39 and their Milken is from all angles
37:41 McDonald's and Nike and everything all
37:43 they want us to do is lust for things
37:47 well the soul could be some apparition
37:50 that constantly flows through us giving
37:54 us identity if we are the red dye that
37:56 goes through the current in the water
37:58 that moves on then we would have to
38:00 probably say that we are one
38:01 consciousness simply going through all
38:03 the light bulbs in the Christmas tree
38:08 observed from the relative point of the
38:12 lightning of the light bulb itself we
38:14 could ask the label what are you and he
38:16 says I am a red light bulb and yes the
38:18 green one she says a green light bulb
38:20 but in the end it's powered by soul
38:22 energy that flows through all of them
38:25 why do we have this Gnostic ability to
38:28 pull information straight out of the
38:30 universe if we open our mind to it
38:32 because the entire universe is knowledge
38:34 base is the force by which we are
38:36 actually powered on a consciousness
38:38 level we think in electrons and we think
38:42 about electricity we have no problem
38:43 perceiving that but if I say replace an
38:45 electron with consciousness whole global
38:48 omnipotent God consciousness flowing
38:51 through us like water going down the
38:53 most beautiful waterfalls in existence
38:56 and each little tiny bump and nuke and
38:59 cranny in the ground is a being that's
39:03 suddenly too abstract for the mind to
39:06 believe right I think we need to go
39:09 there I think we need to go there in a
39:12 really big way I think we need to
39:14 explore the absolute esoteric and I
39:16 think that as a group if you're
39:19 interested in this sort of thing I think
39:21 it's up to us to start to parse where we
39:25 haven't looked before like when I put my
39:26 fingers on my eyes and I felt like my
39:28 body was becoming an eyeball it was
39:32 amazing it was very very vivid and very
39:36 powerful and much different than
39:37 anything I've ever perceived my skin to
39:39 be doing before right but let me break
39:42 for one second in the middle of this
39:44 conversation and remind us all that we
39:48 know that these conversations are fairly
39:50 rare in the world right
39:52 what is there like nearly 1,800
39:55 subscribers to this channel but goddamn
39:57 it goes slow right so in terms of
40:01 opening the minds of man to appreciate
40:03 what we're saying we have to get our
40:05 craft together at this elevated level of
40:08 discussion and then we have to boil it
40:11 down so everyone else can understand it
40:13 as well and then someone has to write a
40:14 paper that's sort of the big bang
40:17 version of our idea such that the world
40:20 can start having the conversation so
40:22 they have the words to have the
40:24 conversation the visual aids to have the
40:26 conversation right
40:27 the most basic thing I think we can
40:30 repeat to each other is that the society
40:33 closes our minds that's what it does
40:35 from the moment were born to the moment
40:36 we die
40:37 you're more closed off than you could
40:42 possibly imagine
40:43 now there is a bit of an explosion of
40:46 course when you're a child and you grow
40:47 and you learn your senses and you learn
40:49 that there's something bigger than your
40:51 bedroom then there's the there's the
40:53 house and then there's a school and then
40:54 there's a field in buff up ah jump on a
40:57 plane you realize the worlds out there
40:58 you get on the internet as the teenage
41:00 you realize there are people in other
41:01 countries so there's a bit of an
41:05 expansion but for everything that
41:07 expands your mind and your perception I
41:09 believe that we are being expanded into
41:13 constraints right but there are two
41:18 families of constraints there is the
41:22 tangible reality which we recognize as
41:24 the atomic reality our mass energy
41:29 models and then there's the
41:31 consciousness side of the game but now
41:35 let's double back on both those and
41:37 describe the words that we use and the
41:39 concepts that we use to acknowledge
41:41 either one of those hemispheres to each
41:42 other right how do we do it we talked
41:46 about the senses oh my god you know I
41:50 took LSD and the first thing I felt was
41:52 this warm liquid kind of crawling up my
41:54 back and going over my head and then I
41:56 laid down and I saw these amazing things
41:59 and then I heard this motorcycle go by
42:02 or I heard some really gangster rap
42:04 music and what I would see
42:05 started to transform to be really dark
42:08 and scary we turned it off or it drove
42:10 by I could feel the wind on my body and
42:15 and I got this pulsing energy of
42:17 flickering awareness on my skin and the
42:21 drug continued to bardo and create you
42:25 know high tides and low tides our
42:28 vocabulary is utterly constrained by our
42:30 perception of senses but now let me ask
42:35 you aside from science fiction and
42:38 perhaps these are legitimate ideas of
42:41 seeing dead people saying or isn't that
42:43 sort of thing if I ask you very quickly
42:46 to come up with another sense that has
42:48 never been itemized by man before how
42:51 long would it take you to come up with
42:52 even a couple words strung together to
42:55 give me the notion that you've actually
42:56 perceived of a of a sense that we
43:02 haven't discussed already in some form
43:04 or fashion it's tough right it's about
43:08 like me saying please think up a number
43:11 set that has never been used before not
43:16 a different base but you're not to use 1
43:19 through 0 here to use something else
43:21 to indicate quantity to indicate
43:24 relationships between quantities I want
43:28 to add a masseuse way back in goddamn
43:31 probably 27 years ago she said that she
43:37 was visited by aliens quite frequently
43:39 she had lost sleep paralysis said she
43:42 only need sleep a couple hours a night
43:43 which was interesting and she said her
43:45 husband cooperated everything that
43:47 happened to her I never met that man but
43:48 she said that the aliens that she met
43:50 used colors as math that when you add
43:55 you know red and blue together you get
43:59 purple right so for them it's three and
44:01 plus four equals seven I thought that
44:04 was very interesting why not
44:10 as long as it's discernible why not but
44:14 isn't it interesting that once we push
44:15 the mind into a new area into a new
44:17 category of thought
44:19 is pain there is a weird pain when
44:24 you're reading a book and learning
44:25 something very complicated you get tired
44:27 and you could because and you feel sort
44:29 of a pain fatigue it's like I don't know
44:31 if I've got this sort of like the same
44:33 sort of exhaustion you feel when you're
44:35 doing manual labor or you're hiking up a
44:38 really steep hill Hill you know you know
44:40 you just put one foot in front of the
44:41 other and eventually it'll top out but
44:46 you want to quit deep down inside you
44:50 want to quit but if you don't amazing
44:52 things occur right get to the top of
44:55 that trail you finish roofing that house
44:59 and I'm going to tell you right now that
45:01 if we can get some sort of communication
45:04 established or you guys can point me to
45:06 something that is well established that
45:08 is a great metaphor for this whole thing
45:10 we can advance our thought the gut
45:14 feeling is a very interesting one that
45:16 is very widely discussed and accepted in
45:20 the Asian communities they'll ask you
45:22 about a business deal or a personal
45:25 decision well what's your gut say and
45:27 they almost always go with their gut
45:30 which is probably one of the reasons why
45:32 they're successful at things because I
45:34 don't think the gut has the ability to
45:36 lie the gut is the de-facto lie detector
45:41 test of whether or not you're full of
45:43 [ __ ] or not without someone else's
45:47 around you what do we gain if we can
45:50 come up with another sentence I think
45:52 that one of the definitions of a sense
45:54 is power and control I really honestly
45:58 believe that they talk about the
46:01 atomistic era of man when the spiritual
46:03 and the physical were actually always
46:05 perceived as an interchangeable
46:07 coexistence
46:08 I like that what we have been in such a
46:13 pluralistic society where man and God
46:16 are separate and we've been in that
46:19 sense you know people realize they could
46:20 control man by instilling such a
46:22 paradigm in the mind of men closing off
46:25 again the spiritual world right but we
46:29 have a hard time perceiving of any other
46:31 reality
46:32 and even though we can conceptually
46:35 think about the spiritual world in this
46:37 world being together it's still tough to
46:39 come up with a daily mechanic if that
46:41 were to become believed and thus become
46:45 reality for us right one of the up shots
46:49 of this sort of conversation for me is
46:51 that it starts to remove the constraints
46:53 of self-appointed authorities over us
46:57 it's not that we're trying to defy them
46:59 or even specifically address them in any
47:01 way shape or form what we are
47:03 essentially doing is walking away from
47:05 the burden of their existence of their
47:08 closed minds that believe that they are
47:10 higher than us right does the Pope who
47:16 will over all the Catholics is his
47:19 ability to do so and have predecessors
47:22 and successors do the same is that an
47:27 open mind concept or is that a closed
47:31 mind concept I would argue the latter
47:37 perhaps control is only accessible from
47:42 one being to another if one can convince
47:46 the other one to closed their mind to
47:47 any other idea well he must be
47:50 controlled by someone that's just the
47:52 way it is Wow well let me put my arm
47:57 around you and tell you what to do
47:59 slowly the other big situation is that
48:04 we perceive our souls to be sort of
48:06 again like I mentioned in the other
48:07 episode a whale swimming in an infinite
48:11 ocean we are a soul swimming in an
48:14 infinite universe with really no
48:15 accountability because we cannot perhaps
48:18 engage in anything that's perceived as
48:20 bad a KA sin because all is permitted no
48:24 one can be hurt by another we are truly
48:27 equal when we are in our pure soul form
48:29 by coming down in the contextual rapper
48:32 that is a human well then we gain a
48:35 bunch of interesting perspectives rules
48:38 perceptions paradigms senses
48:43 can we operate on this planet
48:45 willy-nilly and have completely carried
48:47 a cloud of humanity I would say as long
48:52 as people observe common law perhaps
48:54 maybe it is my belief that folks soon
48:59 resort to actions which don't benefit
49:04 others and probably out of pure
49:06 ignorance more than stupidity you know
49:09 what if someone in a free society they
49:13 said look we like throwing things off of
49:15 high places and watching them hit the
49:17 ground and we film them in you know
49:20 super fast cameras and then they come to
49:24 your house they go we need more stuff to
49:26 throw off the top and you're like well I
49:27 don't have anything that I can give you
49:29 and they're like but we're taking this
49:31 because this looks great and you're like
49:33 that's mine it wouldn't work
49:36 they'd have to have common law and some
49:39 understanding so becoming completely
49:42 eath reminded and absent to the
49:44 accountability to each other and this
49:46 particular paradigm of existence it just
49:48 doesn't work long-term there are perhaps
49:52 not even short-term right this is an
49:55 episode where I am searching just as
49:57 much as you are and I don't want to wait
50:00 until I have everything figured out in
50:02 order to make an episode I think it is
50:06 absolutely obvious that we have a
50:08 tremendous number of senses our mortal
50:14 coils police a little bit of the senses
50:17 but because I believe we do have a
50:19 mind's eye that is driven by our soul
50:21 and its connection to the universe and
50:24 as long as we can build that
50:25 relationship up detoxify our bodies to
50:27 increase the coax cable to it to our
50:31 glands and the health of our glands we
50:35 will be able to open our minds would be
50:38 a beautiful thing
50:39 right my approach is to go after the
50:42 more esoteric improvements in my sensual
50:47 structure than to go after very specific
50:49 things and what I mean by that is that I
50:52 am more interested in just kind of well
50:55 it's easy to come back at the
50:56 the way if someone says we'll look you
50:58 saw Walt Disney at Disneyland in your
51:01 mind's eye and he told you where a
51:03 person was and he was standing right
51:04 where he said he was so let's just
51:07 acknowledge that and say that there are
51:09 spirits on the other side they
51:11 maintained their gender they maintained
51:12 their identity and they also live where
51:15 they want to live they protect it in
51:18 some form or fashion right that's
51:21 valuable and we should keep inventory of
51:23 those things especially as you've
51:26 experienced them and you can't ascribe
51:27 it to someone else fine that's your bag
51:31 and that's what you know to exist but to
51:35 pull back in front of that use of the
51:39 sense I want to know what sense makes
51:43 that contextual experience happen in
51:46 business is a good to always ask the
51:49 question of what is a particular
51:51 technology's utility to the universe why
51:56 does it exist I mean just go to the
51:59 absolute core take electricity for
52:02 example one might say well lectricity is
52:05 good for powering television sets
52:07 iPhones computers you're not wrong
52:12 perhaps the most fundamental
52:13 understanding of electricity that we
52:15 should absorb first is that it creates a
52:19 ecosystem a currency a current of force
52:26 it creates an ability for us to
52:28 distribute force around this globe and
52:32 perhaps into space perhaps we can
52:33 harvest it from space right once you see
52:37 the underlying function of electrons
52:41 over a conductive valence then you start
52:45 applying its utilities on top of that
52:47 core capability if you were forming a
52:51 business and you are inventing a
52:53 technology it is always good to look at
52:55 its core utility first and then develop
52:59 solutions on top of the core utility you
53:03 know even a reservoir that holds water
53:05 is the utility of supply how it is used
53:09 downstream
53:10 you take a shower with it make some food
53:12 with it do whatever you want with it
53:13 fill your pool with it that is the use
53:16 of the overall utility of a being in
53:18 existence to begin with right
53:21 reality is a utility your soul is the
53:25 utility your soul energy would be your
53:28 utility your body is utility and it
53:34 metabolizes into higher constructs
53:36 higher concepts higher levels of
53:38 specific functionality that you can use
53:40 for yourself to live your life right
53:43 some people say they can feel the life
53:46 within plants and I would say that those
53:49 that cannot feel the life of plants
53:51 aren't surrounded by plants on any level
53:54 I just had a friend of mine travel to a
53:58 Midwestern location surrounded by
54:00 beautiful greenery and their description
54:07 of how peaceful that place felt was
54:11 related to the beauty of plants being
54:14 around them and they hang around with me
54:17 enough to know how to articulate the
54:19 idea that perhaps this is a life force
54:21 that they are feeling from the plants
54:24 not just a being that creates oxygen for
54:29 us that we breathe which is also
54:30 wonderful what a beautiful relationship
54:32 where you might have that I exhale what
54:35 a plant uses as its breathing apparatus
54:37 and it excels what I breathe it's an
54:41 amazing thing and yet I give myself the
54:44 credit of life the designation of a
54:47 higher being and it is very rare that
54:52 someone gives the equal balance back to
54:54 a plant of having the same wisdom when
54:57 plants have been on this planet way
54:59 longer than we have no matter where we
55:00 came from there are so many shots keys
55:04 of intelligent design around us it's
55:05 incredible if you believe in intelligent
55:09 design and again you could be an alien
55:12 buff the UFO buff you could be a
55:14 Christian you could be something that's
55:16 existential between the two you become
55:19 more powerful intellectual leap right
55:21 away
55:23 when you can start giving the world a
55:25 purpose because you're willing to
55:27 acknowledge what you see right in front
55:28 of your face what are the odds that we
55:31 have one being that exhales what we
55:34 inhale and we exhale what they inhale
55:36 what an amazing thing and what's utterly
55:40 fascinating about you know clear-cutting
55:43 forests and jungles you know Brazil
55:45 again Brazil sold off most of their
55:47 forests to China to cut down and then
55:51 during the Olympics they ran some
55:53 [ __ ] you know global warming bit
55:56 when they are utterly cutting down the
55:58 thing that will sustain human life
56:02 unbelievable doublespeak right I'm going
56:06 to wager that there are a number of you
56:08 whether or not you would ever
56:09 acknowledge it in a comment or to
56:11 another living being that you feel that
56:14 inanimate objects at least one or two in
56:16 your life have a spirit for men it's
56:19 usually a screwdriver a car
56:24 perhaps if you do your laundry as a
56:26 woman you might think it's a washer and
56:29 dryer because they perform well they do
56:33 their job as soon as they start
56:35 performing badly the car starts breaking
56:36 down or some of the 'pliance tarts
56:38 breaking down you start to
56:42 anthropomorphize these beings it has
56:46 been my personal experience that when
56:48 you love something and you do take care
56:52 of it it works really well whether it be
56:56 a human being or one appliance for those
57:01 of you have had heirlooms handed down
57:02 throughout your family there's a bizarre
57:05 sort of sense that we have that there is
57:09 a remnant perhaps like the movie The
57:11 Shining or the book The Shining
57:12 suggested which is it's like burnt toast
57:15 sometimes if someone burns toast in the
57:18 morning you can still smell at night
57:19 when there's not a single particle of
57:21 that toast invisible range anywhere
57:23 because everything was cleaned up but
57:25 you can still smell it someone gives you
57:28 the old ball peen hammer that your
57:30 grandfather had and when you hold it in
57:33 your hand there's a nostalgic attachment
57:35 to it but there's a sense
57:36 that you can feel through the hammer
57:40 your relative sum gives you an old watch
57:45 on a fob right and you feel like that's
57:50 part of their being they touched it they
57:53 held it the patina the way that the
57:55 inscription might have been rubbed out
57:57 of the back of it has life those of you
58:01 who collect coins you see the wear and
58:05 tear on a coin from 1955 and you're
58:07 thinking oh my god this was this was
58:10 forged right in the middle the you know
58:11 the nuclear scare in the world or one
58:14 that's Wars in 1969 and it's it's
58:17 potentially the era of man landing on
58:20 the moon for all those people out there
58:22 the Hindus believe that when you make
58:24 love and you orgasm with your partner
58:26 that a part of your soul exchanges with
58:29 their soul you give a part of it away
58:32 which is one reason why they say do not
58:35 sleep around because you will give away
58:37 so much of your soul to other people
58:39 that by the time you find the person
58:41 that you're supposed to meet you do not
58:43 have a complete being to give to them
58:45 you have a partial being these theories
58:49 have been made over thousands of years
58:50 through watching and observing the
58:53 impact of certain behaviors wise people
58:57 came up with these deductions and
59:00 whether or not they are technically
59:02 correct about what they're saying let's
59:03 just say they're technically maybe not
59:06 correct the soul exchanges between
59:08 another person which I think they're
59:12 right there's something else that is
59:14 equally powerful and truthful about
59:16 their statements that we simply don't
59:17 understand because we don't exactly know
59:19 the moving parts on the other side of
59:21 consciousness right I should say the
59:24 other side that is consciousness most of
59:27 you who have been involved with someone
59:29 romantically that it didn't he didn't
59:31 work out but you're still friends when
59:36 you see their picture when you see them
59:37 in person when you think about them
59:39 there's this amazing tunnel of
59:41 connection it could be 20 30 40 years
59:45 ago that you have this amazing liaison
59:49 with another human being
59:50 doesn't have to be romantic there are
59:53 plenty of soldiers that have fought in
59:54 war and they remember the theatres of
59:57 war and they remember the sacrifice to
59:59 someone made for them or just their a
60:02 friendly voice in the middle of utter
60:03 chaos and they have a bond for ever and
60:10 when those people pass away due to war
60:12 being a ridiculous machine that we used
60:14 to or the bankers used to keep us in
60:16 debt to them and we build memorials and
60:21 we etch in those memorials the names of
60:23 our of our loved ones our buddies that's
60:27 why the vietnam memorial still gathers
60:29 around it soldiers that you know it was
60:34 just like yesterday they lost their best
60:36 friend or a buddy I know people that
60:40 have been in squadrons together and they
60:43 felt another person was an absolute pain
60:46 in the ass they didn't dislike them or
60:48 anything like man as guys I was just
60:49 kind of a on redu to hang out with but
60:51 the second he passes away the very
60:53 essence of his intent is understood and
60:57 he goes from being sort of a an honorary
60:59 spirit to them to being an absolute hero
61:02 for the rest of the lives perhaps the
61:05 last moment of their life they
61:07 sacrificed everything to save a few
61:10 right these are all driven by senses
61:14 that I do not believe are acknowledged
61:16 in any book of quote-unquote science
61:19 right the other religion of existence if
61:26 we are to rebuild this place from the
61:28 bottom up is my suggestion that these
61:31 are exactly the sorts of things that
61:32 need to be contemplated by those who are
61:34 interested in it for those who
61:37 understand it understand its mystery if
61:41 nothing else the journey will reveal
61:43 more about the mystery of the whole
61:47 thing right let's see you go down this
61:49 journey for a couple of years and at the
61:50 end you feel like you're none the wiser
61:53 necessarily on paper you can't write a
61:56 book about it because you really didn't
61:57 discover anything definitive but the
62:00 search itself enhanced your own senses
62:04 that perhaps you didn't realize we're
62:08 augmenting in your mind they were
62:10 getting better more powerful but you're
62:12 looking over here to the left
62:13 specifically looking for a force or a
62:16 sense in one region of the world not
62:18 realizing over here on your right things
62:20 are exploding so make sure that if you
62:23 dive into this sort of thinking to
62:25 continually do a 360 pan to look for
62:29 everything because I'm sure that
62:32 enlightenment is happening all around
62:34 you constantly regardless if you know
62:35 what or not right
62:37 most the time presentations have a nice
62:39 beginning middle and end right you're
62:42 supposed to not go to the podium not get
62:45 on stage and not lecture unless you have
62:47 the profound epiphany the crescendo at
62:50 the end of the story to enlighten and
62:52 make the audience go wow this
62:56 conversation is meant to inspire thought
63:01 to put forth a quiz for all of us to
63:05 take on our own terms
63:07 don't worry about my terms you might
63:09 engage my terms if you run out of your
63:11 own terms but to try and answer these
63:13 questions if your response is some
63:16 gigantic knee-jerk thing back into a
63:18 paradigm then I think most of us will
63:21 ignore your observation the comments
63:24 that show that they are well thought out
63:26 that they have a little bit of
63:28 humiliation in them and that you don't
63:30 know everything but you're trying and
63:32 you're pushing those are the comments
63:35 that get read by me the most that aspire
63:37 me the most to change my mind or to
63:39 develop my thinking which result new
63:41 episodes again for those of you come
63:44 through a podcast exclusively and you
63:47 hate social media which I completely
63:48 understand you really don't want to get
63:50 any type of debated with anyone online
63:51 just understand that YouTube comments
63:54 are typically pretty compartmentalized
63:55 someone will post their comment and walk
63:58 away they're not getting into everyone
64:00 else's comments if you're that kind of
64:02 person and hopefully you have a good
64:04 rapport with humanity and you're willing
64:06 to accept other other ideas of reality
64:10 we have to grow people we have to grow
64:14 as human beings
64:16 because we've seen what this level of
64:18 growth creates and I would honestly say
64:22 our report card is if not a f+ it's it's
64:27 a d-minus
64:28 - right not us in particular but the
64:33 overall mean of intelligence and
64:35 perception of the universe as dictated
64:37 by beings that are bipedal on this
64:39 planet Earth were what repairing things
64:43 we're gaining traction but there's a lot
64:46 of work to do right we got to get out of
64:49 these hate bubbles and this is a
64:53 conversation where you get to come to
64:54 the leather sofas and sit down and relax
64:57 and it's the air is just perfect and you
65:00 get whatever you want to pacify yourself
65:03 a nice cold iced tea or a nice hot cigar
65:08 and think things through there's a
65:11 listener out there who has her own
65:12 channel Laurie Gayle I'm just going to
65:14 mention her personally
65:15 I think she is just a top-notch human
65:18 being she goes out and she lives and I
65:21 believe like Pennsylvania somewhere just
65:25 lives in a gorgeous Vista of why she
65:28 walks out of her door in every place she
65:29 sees is just utterly gorgeous but with a
65:31 couple miles in a car and some more foot
65:34 work she can get to beautiful streams
65:35 and rivers and forests and she goes out
65:38 into these beautiful areas I'm envious
65:42 and she talks like a real human being
65:45 she's super compassionate human being
65:48 I'll link her video channel down below
65:51 for YouTube but I do not believe she has
65:54 an audio equivalent and some of you have
65:56 the the whatever the hell it is that
66:00 YouTube has the extra subscription
66:03 service we can download the audio
66:04 versions to your phone or what have you
66:06 but I view her as an ideal human being
66:09 that fairly observes things comments on
66:13 them and I think that we should strive
66:18 to be more like that peaceful
66:22 constructive loving understanding
66:26 confused by other people's negativity
66:29 be willing to dive straight into the
66:32 rabbit hole of a crazy belief system and
66:34 then have the ability to either commit
66:37 to it full-time or to crawl back out of
66:40 it and say you know that was really cool
66:41 it was a great adventure but you know I
66:43 don't know if I believe that anymore I
66:45 think that's about it for this episode
66:47 hope you felt me deep thoughts radio.com
66:50 for all the feeds there's video if
66:52 you're an audio audio if you're on video
66:54 to video options or youtube.com/ to
66:56 search on deep thoughts radio or search
66:58 on the same thing on vid that me vit eme
67:02 hard podcasts are concerned iTunes or
67:05 Google Play has it again search on deep
67:07 thoughts radio or just go to the website
67:09 every link is up there I keep forgetting
67:12 to mention there's a patreon account up
67:13 there you know for those of you want to
67:16 contribute I would love to use some of
67:19 the proceeds to buy a 4k camera I think
67:21 that'd be cool
67:22 I've mentioned that in the past but I've
67:24 never really pushed the revenue model
67:26 let's get out there and explore our
67:28 senses let's explore beyond the obvious
67:31 right when you're alone and you're bored
67:35 okay I shouldn't say even alone when
67:37 you're just bored wherever the hell you
67:39 are sitting on the crapper sitting in an
67:41 airport sitting in jam traffic instead
67:44 of going to that phone to extinguish
67:48 your mind just be in your own skin be in
67:54 your body and if you have any epiphanies
67:58 whatsoever please get to a point you can
68:01 report them back to us right now there's
68:03 a locked Facebook group as well
68:04 again just search our deep thoughts
68:06 radio we've had a lot of uptakes from a
68:07 lot of great people lot of people join
68:09 the group and just some great comments
68:11 and observations I've been really busy
68:13 recently so my replies have been very
68:16 limited I typically will have a good
68:18 night once a week where I get in there
68:21 and reply to all you guys and give you
68:23 some responses so if I'm not replying
68:24 don't take it personal just really busy
68:27 I think that's it take care of yourself
68:29 and someone else then I will see you in
68:31 the next D thoughts over now
68:34 [Music]
68:52 so let's get across the scope we got now
68:59 some of you might not be asking why the
69:01 hell are you belaboring its connection
69:03 to the body and the reason why is that
69:05 the body is a fairly mechanical easy to
69:12 make great [ __ ] bloop around in this
69:14 thing
