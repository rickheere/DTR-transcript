00:00 [Music]
00:32 welcome back to DS and gentlemen on this
00:38 beautiful Sunday afternoon today's
00:41 episode is going to be about our
00:43 differences so there are obviously a ton
00:48 of people watching stuff online
00:50 some of you bump into this show
00:54 sometimes I make a show that you
00:58 completely believe or you know you're
01:00 you don't have any differences with my
01:03 opinions here and there and again
01:04 they're just my opinions right it's I've
01:08 had a very intense life I've been into
01:11 several corners of this universe in
01:13 terms of experience I still at it you
01:18 know infinitely small sample of what the
01:20 world has to actually offer earth that
01:22 is and nevertheless I feel packed with
01:28 all these tiny experiences that I have
01:31 had you know when I look at the world
01:36 and meet new people it takes a really
01:39 long time to meet someone who has had as
01:42 much diversity as I've had and even
01:47 tougher to find folks with more
01:49 experiences than I have but I fly meet
01:51 them all the time but it takes you know
01:53 10 people to find one person who has you
01:58 know lived as much life and then you
02:00 know maybe one in 50 who's just utterly
02:03 blown past me and I'm going to qualify
02:06 that because I'm not trying to sound the
02:09 slightest bit boastful the idea is you
02:12 know I would probably
02:14 I'm with debate whether or not to keep
02:16 some of the experiences I've had
02:18 I probably keep some of the decisions I
02:21 made that gave me the experiences right
02:24 when I made an informed decision or
02:27 uninformed decision excuse me but
02:31 there's this interesting thing that
02:33 happens when you make a YouTube channel
02:34 and I see people deal with it sometimes
02:38 and I see most the pros just ignore it
02:43 but this is not that kind of show you
02:48 know where you know again I like to see
02:52 people subscribe but and I and I'm not
02:54 exactly happy when I see someone
02:56 unsubscribe and that's the honest truth
03:00 that's only because I think of the
03:04 community of people that I've seen hit
03:05 the Lochte's Facebook group or people
03:08 that are really developed common
03:10 commenters on YouTube I feel like you
03:14 know the whimsical easy come easy go
03:16 hey there's no emotions attached to
03:18 those folks right they came in for one
03:20 video maybe their Bigfoot buffs and they
03:23 jumped in and they thought I what I said
03:24 was fair at least and so they jump on
03:26 for a little while and then they don't
03:27 see anything else bigfooty or
03:30 supernatural or whatever and they're
03:32 like ass channels not for me and they go
03:34 you know that's just natural selection
03:36 right you want to spend your time wisely
03:39 and if you unsubscribe if a person I
03:42 should say on subscribe to this channel
03:43 to more focus and hone on what they're
03:45 interested in then where's the problem
03:48 in that right so but the reason why I'm
03:55 making this particular video is that
03:56 there are some great contributors to the
03:59 YouTube channel
03:59 as well as the Facebook channel Facebook
04:03 once you get into Facebook people are
04:05 just so chill and you guys contribute so
04:07 much information so many articles you
04:11 know sometimes it I'll be at work doing
04:14 something heads down and I'll look up on
04:17 my phone maybe on the way home
04:20 and I'll see you like you know ten
04:23 things I need to prove when I get home
04:24 you know I'm not approving every single
04:27 thing that people submit because
04:29 sometimes it's just too much information
04:31 in a short period of time but I think
04:33 that you know I'm just not sure or
04:37 things they're little sometimes they're
04:40 repeated by the way sometimes you guys
04:41 don't realize that way down the page
04:43 what you've just submitted to the pages
04:45 I've already been submitted so sometimes
04:47 that happens as well so don't get don't
04:49 take any offense but I want to dive into
04:52 a few subjects and just sort of the
04:56 principles of how I think that
04:59 differences have been branded to us
05:03 because having a difference with another
05:05 human being means different things at
05:08 different times means different things
05:10 with different subjects you know if we
05:13 went to say a pizza place together and
05:16 you know it's it's almost given after
05:19 you past the age of 20 but you need to
05:23 check on the ingredients and the people
05:25 that you're with to see who has
05:26 preferences you know sometimes the food
05:30 is just merely a taste preference
05:32 sometimes it's a biological preference
05:34 or you know you're vegan and you don't
05:37 want to eat meat and you don't want to
05:38 even share half the pizza if it has meat
05:40 on the other side because of your
05:41 beliefs hey some of you have health
05:45 issues than eating a lot of greasy meats
05:48 or a problem but you can eat other meats
05:50 that aren't greasy you know it just
05:52 depends in those scenarios we have a
05:56 difference that we acknowledge we
05:58 respect those differences and it's not a
06:01 big deal it's not a bump in the road for
06:05 us but other more fundamental
06:07 differences that lead to a method of how
06:11 to live become very important to us and
06:19 so we feel as if someone is not like us
06:24 then we have an issue but more
06:27 importantly if we feel like someone is
06:29 evangelizing this difference between
06:31 what we believe and what
06:32 you know others believe we sometimes
06:36 perceive that there's a lot of harm
06:37 being done which we get into even common
06:41 law operations of how we live right our
06:44 modus operandi so what I want to get
06:48 into this because there are some
06:50 brilliant folks who contribute to the
06:53 channel and obviously there is no way in
06:57 hell that we could sit down and agree on
07:01 everything but I think that it's the you
07:06 know we're getting rid of fake news
07:08 right we're getting rid of people
07:09 talking to you like this right they just
07:11 patronize you they try to put as many
07:13 puns and plays on words inside their
07:17 news reporting and we're just getting
07:19 sick and tired of it because now we've
07:21 seen the long-term disadvantage of sort
07:25 of living in a news methodology or
07:27 information infrastructure on the world
07:29 that is you know really only it you know
07:32 it gained its inroads as the printing
07:35 press really shifted over to the
07:37 Randolph Hearst yellow journalism and
07:40 now we've seen it pumped up to the point
07:42 where governments are actually trying to
07:45 pass laws to force you to take super bad
07:48 propaganda right we see that hurting
07:52 society and so you know the government's
07:54 are trying they're going to fail the
07:56 news agencies are trying to save
07:57 themselves print is really funny because
08:00 print in actual newspapers are really
08:04 trying to demonize the speed at which
08:05 information comes to us the speed of
08:07 which [ __ ] could be called because
08:09 they will print something on the front
08:11 page that isn't true and there's only
08:14 one bias you know basically the the
08:16 whoever wrote the article and then the
08:18 editor has it spun this particular way
08:20 and then it goes out and that's what
08:22 they've been able to do for hundreds of
08:24 years in one way or another
08:27 today we dismantle that because we don't
08:31 like being lied to
08:32 now with certain things it's a hell of a
08:34 lot easier to validate the information
08:36 if it's a real-world event and there's a
08:38 lot of people spectating who aren't in
08:41 on the bias and they have the ability to
08:43 look into a telephone post a message on
08:45 a social media
08:46 aratus we can triangulate the truth out
08:52 of the propaganda and so for those
08:55 matters of which we might disagree
08:57 the real exercise at that point is
09:00 simply to say please just bring me the
09:02 other perspectives that you saw the
09:04 counteract the ones that I think I saw
09:07 you know that's why the term smoking gun
09:10 has become not only just a catchphrase
09:14 it's all over the web but it's become
09:16 our scientific method to vet fake
09:19 information there are you know people
09:25 want to debate moon missions and then
09:27 NASA a greenlight something called
09:30 project Orion project Orion was trying
09:33 to push human flesh through the Van
09:34 Allen belts without killing it after
09:37 they realized that they had admitted
09:39 that they never went to the moon because
09:40 you know that was not a problem for any
09:42 of the moon missions they cancelled the
09:45 project which means they probably just
09:47 took it out of the limelight
09:49 and changed its name on the books but
09:53 there are some subjects that are very
09:55 very important to us as individuals they
10:01 always tell this lie about America that
10:03 it was founded on the freedom of
10:05 religion it was a byproduct of freedom
10:10 of speech
10:11 it wasn't my people sailed across the
10:14 ocean
10:15 they sailed across the ocean to get away
10:17 from tyranny from financial and
10:21 government monarchical tyranny I don't
10:26 even know if morals work but the
10:29 monarchy control over various regions of
10:31 Europe they were tired of the church
10:34 telling them what they had to believe a
10:36 freedom religion had any validity in
10:39 some person going down to the shore and
10:42 jumping on one of the three ships that
10:45 came over it was that the church was a
10:48 bullying organization you know that the
10:51 Pope I shouldn't say that
10:53 the first incarnations of Christianity
10:56 in Europe forged through the
10:59 Inquisition's
11:00 the use of mercenaries like Blackwater
11:02 right what was Blackwater well
11:05 Blackwater was ex-military experts Delta
11:08 Force all the way down to your standard
11:10 Special Forces best of what they do on
11:13 planet earth they're hand-picked usually
11:16 because they have very little connection
11:18 to a mediate family you know they have
11:20 extended family they don't have like
11:22 wife's and children a lot of times so
11:25 that way they have nothing to risk and
11:26 they're just looking to take the pain
11:29 away with a little bit of a paycheck and
11:30 so they're willing to do things that
11:34 aren't allowed in the world and of
11:37 course the whole thing was shoveled into
11:39 the middle east as this this
11:42 organization is sort of operating
11:44 outside of the law they're not even
11:47 though they're American citizens a lot
11:48 of times they're not governed by you
11:51 know conventions of war and that sort of
11:53 thing I've got some friends of mine that
11:56 know a lot about those guys as well as
11:58 the folks that have been in it
11:59 and the stories of what they did back in
12:02 the in the heat of the post 9/11 era
12:05 it's it's unbelievable the reason why
12:08 those people were hung and burned on a
12:09 bridge once you know about the regional
12:12 disputes and what was admitted to have
12:15 occurred you'll understand was people
12:18 were you know lynched
12:21 it's a sad and unfortunate thing but
12:26 right now we're in a very interesting
12:27 time right we have folks that are waking
12:36 up and they're waking up to all kinds of
12:39 different lies that have gone on for
12:41 years and again some of these lies don't
12:43 really matter even though we find them
12:46 important and they very interesting for
12:49 instance you know we've had pretty much
12:51 I think the full exposure of JFK's
12:54 assassination we have the exposure of
12:58 you know the moon missions I think are
13:00 pretty good we get a little bit of 911
13:03 in there and Oklahoma bombings and all
13:04 the other fake massacres that happen
13:06 doesn't mean people don't die it just
13:07 means that they're orchestrated for our
13:10 manipulation
13:12 and you know you might bump into a
13:15 friend that has never heard any
13:17 information or the information is so
13:19 overwhelming they simply aren't ready in
13:21 their particular position in life to
13:23 deal with it and you have to give them
13:25 that freedom I've said several times on
13:28 the show that my my previous show
13:30 impaled to radio which was just a radio
13:31 audio show it you know I called my buddy
13:36 of 20 years sky land I was just all
13:38 excited because I was awake and I just
13:40 sort of dropped a couple pieces on him
13:42 and he was not ready and he for the very
13:45 first time sort of you know chastised
13:50 isn't really the right word but he he
13:52 sort of said things to the effect of you
13:55 just can't deal with the fact that
13:57 there's bad people in the world and bad
13:59 things have meaning Arabs who want to
14:01 knock down buildings and stuff so I hang
14:03 up the phone with him at about eight
14:04 months later he calls me up while I was
14:07 on vacation and the first thing I heard
14:10 is you know I've seen it now and I can't
14:14 unsee it and you were right you know and
14:18 he had gone down a whole different
14:20 rabbit hole using zeitgeist the movie so
14:23 I gave him the space he woke up and he
14:25 woke up extra hard and he was the one
14:28 that came to me and said let's start a
14:30 radio show and I was the one who was
14:33 hesitant because I was like that's a lot
14:34 of Darkness man I don't know if I want
14:36 to be associated with all that stuff but
14:40 that blossomed into this show where I
14:42 felt like I needed more time to really
14:44 dive into the cerebral stuff that he
14:46 doesn't have been much interested right
14:49 but I want to dive into at least a few
14:51 subjects I think the two that we're
14:53 really going to talk about and one's
14:55 going to be slightly a repeat which is
14:59 Flat Earth and the other one is going to
15:02 be religion but Before we jump totally
15:06 in let's think about this for a second
15:08 there's two halves to the disagreement
15:11 algorithm when you find yourself in
15:13 disagreement with someone as way more
15:16 slices in that way more dimensions way
15:18 more attributes but i'ma go after two so
15:21 we can have a nice simple productive
15:22 hopefully conversation about this
15:26 there's something really strange about
15:28 being wrong and part of it is because
15:33 when we were kids and I say kids you
15:37 know it could be 18 and below being
15:40 wrong is one of these things where the
15:44 [ __ ] in the neighborhood that you
15:46 hung out with pointed a finger at you
15:48 and laughed made fun of the fact that
15:53 however your brains working inside you
15:56 were gullible you are not knowledgeable
15:59 but the fact remains you might have been
16:02 right and they might have been wrong but
16:03 the mass mob Asteria around being wrong
16:06 and chastising an individual it's just
16:09 inbred in us at a very early age I'm I'm
16:13 not sure that a kid when I deal with
16:16 kids and there's something that they
16:19 have wrong I'm very gentle with them I
16:24 don't really spend any time I just say
16:26 oh no no not that one it's this one over
16:28 here bum bum bum and it's always in an
16:31 upbeat way so the kid doesn't feel
16:33 defensive about it
16:35 but I can tell you right now I can see
16:38 kids that have been raised real well and
16:40 not been exposed to the chastising of
16:42 being wrong and I can see the kids who
16:44 immediately respond badly no matter how
16:47 much I polish it because they won we
16:52 value our intelligence but - they've
16:54 been ridiculed at some point by a parent
16:57 that's why I thank all these videos
16:59 where parents prank their kids and cause
17:02 really horrible emotional scars in them
17:05 it's it's you know if we had a child
17:08 protection service that wasn't linked to
17:10 pedophilia which it is you know they
17:15 needed a visit in my opinion but I
17:18 wouldn't send them after any family at
17:19 this point unless the cow be stolen
17:22 let's just see these parents who they
17:25 wrap fake presents you know they bought
17:28 the kid with the what they want but they
17:30 want to have fun at the expense of the
17:32 child's beautiful morning on Christmas
17:35 and go see my Santa episode of you have
17:37 against Christmas we'll go through that
17:39 conversation a separate episode that
17:41 exists but the kid opens up a brick the
17:45 kid opens up you know bag of poop or
17:48 whatever and of course they're
17:49 emotionally completely devastated the
17:52 parents taught the child you can't trust
17:54 me and I will do anything to entertain
17:58 myself including hurt your feelings
18:01 betray your trust the kids go into these
18:04 you know hysteria hysterics and it's so
18:08 much more dimensional a lot of times
18:10 they'll see criticisms on the child in
18:12 the comments of such a thing everyone
18:14 she's in a long time but I did take a
18:16 some Colossus on compilation someone put
18:19 together it was just really horrific
18:20 parenting and the kid is just like you
18:26 know what the [ __ ] is wrong with the
18:27 world is sort of how they're approaching
18:28 their emotions and the parents are
18:32 laughing their asses off because the
18:33 parent who can't be that intelligent in
18:37 my opinion has got the gift that they
18:39 really want to talk to way but they make
18:41 the kids say a bunch of things that they
18:43 shouldn't say and you know the kids like
18:44 [ __ ] you ba ba ba hu ba ba ba and then
18:47 they give them the gift and now the
18:48 sudden the kid owes the parent an
18:51 apology on Christmas day for being lied
18:54 to right so there I mention that because
18:59 as children what's interesting about
19:01 being a kid all right and we all know
19:05 this there's a lot of [ __ ] up [ __ ]
19:07 happens when you're a kid and there
19:09 ain't no one around to make it right you
19:13 get six or seven kids somewhere in a
19:16 park somewhere in a you know offshoot
19:19 area or whatever even in a bedroom or
19:21 they're all trying to hang out together
19:22 for some reason and someone says
19:24 something horrific someone's lying
19:26 someone is betraying somebody and yeah
19:28 it's petty stuff when it comes right
19:30 down to it but you know you'll have kids
19:34 push kids off cliffs you know just
19:36 because it's funny because he's a dick
19:37 and he doesn't know what you know it's a
19:39 potentially fatal you know fall I mean
19:43 there's just all kinds of stuff that
19:44 happens and it's cars and living crap
19:46 out of us when we're young and as long
19:50 as there's one
19:51 bad family in the neighborhood and all I
19:54 mean is really bad at raising children
19:56 the kids are you know the kids from that
19:58 family are trying to run around the
20:00 world figuring everything out
20:01 serendipitously and they're horrible at
20:03 it because who could be an expert at
20:05 life until someone kind of points you at
20:07 [ __ ] in shinola right but I think that
20:11 that's where the incubation of being
20:14 wrong really hurts that's where it first
20:17 hurts now it gets even more acidic and
20:21 more punishing and more horrible when
20:25 you get older if some form of that
20:27 happens even in a more intellectual way
20:30 which is why most of us search for the
20:33 truth about all things right the
20:36 religion is a huge one right the good
20:40 thing about people who differ about
20:43 religion is that the subtext of the
20:46 difference is that we want the best for
20:51 the humanity we want the best for other
20:53 people and that is sort of this generic
20:57 kernel that gets inserted into all
21:00 movements now some folks are informed
21:05 from sort of a you know a global
21:08 perspective you have both the beliefs of
21:11 religion and you have the beliefs of
21:12 those who don't believe in religion you
21:14 might have parsed religions into pop
21:16 science Christianity and Judaism Muslim
21:19 law Islamic beliefs across-the-board
21:22 Buddhism Hinduism everything right and
21:25 then some folks come in with brilliant
21:30 recollections of their particular
21:32 paradigm they live within whatever
21:35 religion that they have found and they
21:39 have become amazingly important they can
21:41 tell you chapter verse book you know of
21:43 every single thing that's going on and
21:44 in their mind they've lived in it enough
21:46 that they have solved for all the
21:48 anomalies and the contradictions they
21:51 don't want to find an e for one thing
21:53 but you know for whatever reason it just
21:55 jogs through them whoever wrote the book
21:57 was speaking to them right
22:01 and so we always say enlightenment on
22:03 this show is just the pure definition
22:05 which is to see more right so think
22:08 about someone who has been one born into
22:12 Christianity again they were given Santa
22:15 Claus tooth fairy Easter Bunny every
22:18 other fictitious thing as fun as a child
22:20 and Christianity Christianity as I said
22:23 and you know why we believe which I
22:25 think is like episode 4 way back in
22:28 season 1 it's all about keeping religion
22:32 as the one fictitious magic world where
22:35 you don't have to give it up and isn't
22:38 that fun right what if somebody said you
22:41 know what all the card tricks you've
22:43 ever seen in life are fake they're
22:45 sleight of hand they're misdirection
22:47 however at the Magic Castle in Los
22:49 Angeles it is the one place where magic
22:52 is real so when you go to the Magic
22:55 Castle if you have a friend that can get
22:56 you an invite I heard it's actually not
22:59 an invite person on let's open to the
23:03 pulp now that's what I understand still
23:04 to get reservations and you have to
23:05 dress in a suit and a dress but let's
23:08 say it was real there well where would
23:11 you try to spend a lot of your time if
23:12 you loved magic you would go to this
23:14 Magic Castle because that's where it's
23:15 real now the thing is is if whatever
23:20 you're believing makes you a good person
23:22 who cares what anyone else thinks right
23:26 if someone listens to this particular
23:29 show and they have been let's say
23:34 Christian and they hear me parse it
23:38 several times give you dr. L at Wells
23:40 research my own research from Egyptology
23:43 all the way up we start talking about
23:46 you know all the evidence that
23:48 particular things weren't true but in
23:52 the end I give credit to the morality of
23:54 Christianity because in America I can
23:58 unequivocally say there's no class that
24:00 I'm aware of from K through 12 plus you
24:03 know your graduate postgraduate and PhD
24:07 level that teaches morality I'm sure
24:11 there's some specialized course
24:12 somewhere out there but
24:14 it's too late if you're learning it in
24:15 college for Christ's sake you need to
24:17 learn this stuff when you're young and
24:18 the only place in this country it
24:20 happens is Christianity and even if you
24:22 have parents that are non-religious or
24:27 atheists or agnostic or whatever they're
24:31 still teaching morality to you based on
24:34 usually what has been handed down to
24:36 them from grandparents and what have you
24:38 now I would love to believe that common
24:41 law is something that we all strive for
24:43 don't mess with anyone else
24:45 and they won't mess with you on average
24:47 you know I don't know what the odds are
24:49 but it's pretty high that people won't
24:51 mess with you as long as you don't mess
24:52 with them but what's interesting is this
24:57 when you think about the past events
24:59 that have occurred in this particular
25:00 country alone all the conspiracies pick
25:02 one you could live a pretty beautiful
25:06 life from this point forward not knowing
25:08 about any of them now you're bound to
25:11 repeat history you're bound to be very
25:12 gullible to fake news and faked events
25:14 that are going to occur in the future
25:16 without knowing that but you get as an
25:18 individual could live a pretty darn good
25:19 life if you so choose to you might end
25:22 up in a tyrannical place in the end but
25:24 if you won't mind that either because
25:27 you won't know any different but with
25:29 religion there's an interesting caveat
25:31 to it all especially Christianity
25:34 because the name of the game is selling
25:37 salvation you are broken when you are
25:40 born and you need man's help to find God
25:44 or you will go to what the paradigm says
25:50 and labels and calls hell and the place
25:56 you really want to go is what they
25:58 casually define as heaven and so
26:03 obviously when you look at it at face
26:05 value don't do any research or any
26:08 role-playing on what either one of those
26:10 two realms would be and why
26:11 a nipa did brilliant creator would
26:14 create them in the first place okay
26:16 you're thinking that
26:20 everyone in the world will go to hell
26:23 every that's the way God's built the
26:25 place he gives birth to children who are
26:29 all going to hell that's [ __ ] [ __ ]
26:33 weird man that's just the weirdest
26:35 belief system on planet Earth and the
26:39 way that you get out of that that sort
26:42 of pre-existing contract with God right
26:45 you're a baby you're baby and you're
26:47 just born and you're going to hell
26:49 now people will I've been around plenty
26:52 of Christians in my life and when you
26:53 really say it that clearly which is what
26:55 they preach in any other conversation
26:59 you will get people violating the belief
27:02 system of the Bible in order to make
27:04 sure that you don't walk away from their
27:06 church they will say oh well you know I
27:12 don't really thank God takes babies to
27:14 hell it's like well that's just your
27:16 belief where is that in the Bible
27:18 according to the Bible Genesis sets us
27:20 all to fail and you know the New
27:23 Testament is the one methodology and I
27:26 mean one methodology for that baby to
27:30 save itself so if the baby dies in two
27:32 years Catholics think it goes to
27:35 purgatory and never makes it to heaven
27:37 some [ __ ] weird place right if your
27:42 baby is unable to understand what you're
27:44 saying and it dies well woopsie go
27:49 straight to hell right and again
27:51 Christians will jump in on this and
27:53 throw out life preservers and parachutes
27:56 for that baby but there's nothing
27:59 there's none of that written in the
28:01 Bible at all right so yeah I have a
28:05 problem with that personally right but
28:09 someone who believes in that without
28:12 diving super deep and willing to dive
28:14 around the written literature that they
28:17 have been submitted okay they'll think
28:20 that a person like myself is instigating
28:23 more instances of Hell for human beings
28:26 moving forward because they're stuck
28:30 within the paradigm without a periscope
28:33 to look out
28:34 slide that and look back at themselves
28:36 now I had a distinct geographical
28:39 advantage and the way I was brought up
28:42 to pull my head out of any bias I might
28:47 have had and that was being moved around
28:49 a lot as a kid
28:50 however spending I think it's like it's
28:54 a 12 year stent I spend in my hometown
28:56 it was like three and a half to like
28:58 nine almost three half to eight and then
29:03 I came back at 13 I guess or maybe
29:06 technically 12 or something like that
29:08 but if my birthday was right after that
29:09 I left at 17 so whatever the hell that
29:12 is yes it's only about nine years but I
29:18 was raised in a teeny tiny town that was
29:22 safe and wonderful and religious and
29:25 then I was shipped all around the United
29:28 States and I was born in Europe but I
29:30 remember that stuff that not well right
29:32 I wasn't making any opinions or
29:34 decisions about the vector of my life
29:36 but once I popped out of a little town I
29:38 went to a major city I realized that the
29:42 world I was living in was very relative
29:44 to where I came from and all my belief
29:46 systems which a lot of them are just how
29:49 to behave and work hard and be a good
29:51 person well in the city it was much more
29:54 dog-eat-dog and so they don't they don't
29:57 have the privilege of playing that game
29:59 you play The Good Samaritan and you know
30:02 in New York and the 70s they're going to
30:04 get mugged you know was that Times
30:08 Square in the 80s was atrocious man
30:10 that's why you know Giuliani is known
30:13 for cleaning all that up and so it
30:18 wasn't hard for me to ever crawl out of
30:20 a paradigm after my life had been
30:22 conditioned like that to say look you
30:25 live in a very small you're from a very
30:26 small place and the rest of the world
30:29 doesn't live like this and it probably
30:32 wasn't until college that I really found
30:34 out that Christianity is on the smallest
30:37 religions on this planet and that
30:40 Catholicism is the fastest shrinking
30:42 religion on this play now a lot of
30:46 what happens in the comments is that
30:48 someone will say that I have something
30:50 very intensely misunderstood and I
30:54 understand that and I absolutely respect
30:56 that and again I wish it was possible to
30:59 have some really cool venue where we
31:02 could all go and you know but maybe a
31:05 different show but I talk like this and
31:07 everyone's got a mic and we got four or
31:10 five cameras everyone's got a good shot
31:11 maybe even have a guy that's run some
31:13 you know some handheld camera and that
31:17 everyone could express their opinions
31:19 and we could all just acknowledge that
31:22 person's opinion maybe we differ but at
31:25 no point do we disrespect our
31:27 differences right because I know
31:30 personally when I was in the Christian
31:34 movement I get for the second time and I
31:36 when I really chose it instead of being
31:38 thrown into it at 18 years old there was
31:41 a funny moment I've recalled a couple
31:43 times in episodes where we had am what
31:48 the hell you call it where you spend the
31:49 whole night in the church as kids and
31:51 they were obviously elders there and by
31:55 elders and you're talking about people
31:57 in their late 20s maybe up to their late
31:59 40s tops like half a dozen watching us
32:02 kids get a little crazy but they had
32:07 this exercise where this little fun
32:09 project because you know we're there all
32:11 night where one of us was selected to be
32:15 the preacher and you had to just ad-lib
32:17 a sermon and I volunteered and I went up
32:24 there and I don't know why it came over
32:26 me but it came over me really really
32:28 powerfully at 18 years old and I just
32:32 happened to have like three elders
32:35 sitting in the front pew and you know
32:37 they're not expecting anything serious
32:39 to come out of an 18 year old kid and I
32:41 went into this sermon about the fact
32:44 that you know I had just recently
32:46 discovered that the preacher of our
32:47 church believed that Genesis was more of
32:50 an allegorical symbolic story of what
32:53 happened at the beginning of the
32:54 universe and he didn't believe it was
32:57 literal the elders that I lived with
33:00 leaved it was literal and they were
33:01 actually fairly upset that he had
33:03 admitted that to me they were upset that
33:07 the man that ran their church had a
33:08 different opinion than theirs but what
33:11 dawned on me when I discovered this was
33:13 that everyone has a different opinion
33:15 about everything in the Bible I don't
33:18 care what religion you're a part of the
33:21 only reason why someone would say yes I
33:25 believe what you believe yes I believe
33:26 what you believe is because you've got
33:27 an ak-47 and they don't you're their
33:31 boss and you're not their boss you know
33:36 what a man and I mean human is put in a
33:41 room and allowed to really admit what
33:44 they believe with no precede consequence
33:46 of their particular opinion our opinions
33:51 are as close to snowflakes as you could
33:53 possibly imagine and not your Hillary
33:55 Clinton snowflakes but we're all
33:58 different we're all absolutely different
34:01 and if you think about sort of a fractal
34:04 pattern you know when these mathematical
34:06 self supplying self iterating algorithms
34:10 where you take the results of the
34:11 algorithm you put it back into the it
34:13 three use actually create fractals any
34:17 tiny sway of difference between us
34:20 creates a gigantic different thing right
34:23 so if you have little you know nano
34:26 systems running around you know my my
34:27 patio here using concrete as the build
34:30 building mechanism and I say you guys
34:32 you five do whatever you think you need
34:35 to do and here's your initial program
34:36 but you have a variable in there that
34:38 you can extrapolate from the environment
34:39 and I put another five over there on the
34:41 other side of my patio well over here I
34:44 might get a pyramid and over there I
34:45 might get a you know twin tower it's
34:48 going to be different and it's just a
34:50 mathematical certainty of anything that
34:53 has intelligence and what is
34:56 intelligence well it's the harvesting
34:58 and processing and classifying of
35:00 information doesn't have to be
35:04 Encyclopedia it could be you have
35:06 information about how the wind blows on
35:08 your skin and your Latin you have
35:11 thicker skin than me
35:13 I have you know fairly thick German skin
35:16 but I'm fair-skinned right so my opinion
35:18 about spending a day in the Sun might be
35:20 different than your opinion of spending
35:22 a day in the Sun right what I want to
35:25 create is a situation where we can have
35:29 our differences and you see that empty
35:32 comet field underneath a YouTube video
35:34 or a post in Facebook as your ability to
35:41 evangelize your beliefs and your
35:44 differences to everyone who's going to
35:46 read your comment which based on what
35:49 I've seen you know in the last several
35:51 videos I mean it's really been going on
35:52 for dozens and dozens videos with the
35:54 conversation between the between you
35:56 guys the replies that you put on each
35:58 other's posts is increasing ever so
36:01 slightly and you're going to have
36:03 someone who agrees with you and
36:05 disagrees with me and I think that's
36:08 awesome there's nothing wrong with that
36:11 like I've always said on the show if you
36:13 disagree with me the beautiful thing
36:15 about disagreeing with me is one I'm not
36:18 in your face right again if a video
36:21 starts rubbing you really really badly
36:23 and you feel angry at me well you know
36:25 you can turn it off you can push pause
36:27 or stop or whatever and then get in that
36:29 comment section and explain why you
36:31 think I'm wrong and you can even tell me
36:34 there's plenty of comments out there
36:36 dude you're totally got this wrong bump
36:38 up up above one you're galvanized and
36:42 your beliefs even more now and that's
36:45 valuable isn't it I mean think about it
36:48 when you go into a room and you talk to
36:50 a bunch of people that believe what you
36:51 believe is there any fortification
36:54 really and what you believe by having a
36:57 conversation with everyone that already
36:59 believes what you believe I don't think
37:01 so I don't think that needle moves a
37:04 single inch towards I believe this more
37:07 now but when I argue a point that is
37:11 contrary to your belief you then see the
37:14 other side of why you think it is the
37:17 way that you've already determined or
37:20 maybe you parse the information a little
37:22 bit more and you go even further down
37:24 the rabbit hole that you started that
37:25 you showed up with right
37:27 now I'm the type of guide it's like you
37:31 know I don't want to piss anybody off
37:32 necessarily right
37:34 I said not my my style however outside
37:39 of this channel okay then what about
37:41 this a is not related to this channel
37:43 and I've mentioned this several times in
37:46 different videos about you know what
37:48 kind of friend I am I'll put that way I
37:52 can see I can have a friend of mine that
37:54 struggles deeply with life and they
37:58 simply don't know what to do and I'm
37:59 there to help as much as I can right
38:01 offer different perspectives offer
38:03 encouragement to give them sort of some
38:07 mechanism to find the ladder to dig
38:09 themselves climb themselves out of a
38:10 hole but there's a point when a number
38:13 of weeks go by and they they just dwell
38:20 in their negativity they dwell and the
38:23 law of attraction that is demise and
38:27 they're there is a there are some rough
38:32 times out there for people right now and
38:33 they're having a problem dealing with
38:35 their lives and the amount of people I
38:37 know that are damn near homeless
38:39 sometimes of no fault of their own and
38:42 sometimes due directly to their own
38:44 negligence
38:45 it's alarmingly high right now and it's
38:48 it's barely a percentage right but it's
38:50 still you know when you're a person like
38:55 myself who's had to work really really
38:57 hard for everything I've ever had I know
39:00 that if I stopped working really really
39:02 hard not just hard okay but way beyond
39:05 the basics you know I would probably be
39:09 you know homeless and destitute you know
39:13 that's probably not the truth but that's
39:15 how I approach life just to make sure
39:17 I've always got a little bit in reserve
39:19 I got a little bit of coasting room in
39:21 case on struck with a random event like
39:24 a bad economy or something right but I
39:27 also don't play it safe I like
39:30 adrenaline I like dopamine I like to
39:33 take risks and part of me just simply
39:36 says well I'll take this risk and maybe
39:38 I lose everything but god damn and I
39:40 took
39:40 the risk and I lived that life and I all
39:42 my death that I will have no regrets
39:45 right so what happens to these people
39:50 around me that that linger and self-pity
39:54 especially when they've crossed a
39:56 certain you know age bracket well I
39:58 think they need to be a goddamn adult
39:59 you know for me I was an adult as a kid
40:01 you know I was forced to but once you
40:05 hit 30 you're responsible for yourself
40:07 you know you're responsible for getting
40:09 rid of stuff you know previous events
40:12 that have scarred you you need to just
40:15 stop giving a crap about it move on own
40:18 your life right so I definitely parted
40:23 with probably at least a dozen slack you
40:26 know friends / acquaintances because at
40:29 some point I just said alright I've
40:31 listened to this long enough it's time
40:33 for you to get your goddamn life
40:35 together get your act together stop
40:36 sitting around in pity you've surrounded
40:39 yourself with a bunch of enablers who
40:40 just cry with you but they won't [ __ ]
40:43 help you right and there's no one coming
40:45 there's no one coming to help you you're
40:47 a [ __ ] adult get your [ __ ] together
40:49 and get going
40:51 right stop waiting for this imaginary
40:54 you know dude on a white horse to come
40:57 after you or whatever the [ __ ] you need
40:58 right and honestly the closer you get to
41:02 me I'm probably more real like that now
41:03 obviously the more trials and
41:06 tribulations I go through with
41:07 individuals we can have those
41:08 conversations in a couple words and it's
41:11 just kind of like you know for a person
41:13 like I've got a bunch of guys who've
41:15 gone through hell and back who've done
41:17 way more than me I like to surround
41:18 myself with the folks that have done
41:19 more than I have would like to be quite
41:21 frank because then I can have great
41:23 conversations with them if the if
41:26 silence enters the room I just go hmm
41:29 what about that thing you have you did a
41:31 long time ago tell me about that and I
41:32 just sit back and listen to an amazing
41:34 life story right so I dig people like
41:36 that but if they're pissin and moanin
41:38 most my friends don't do any of this
41:40 [ __ ] I'll just give them the look that's
41:43 all it takes and they're like I'm
41:46 bitching and moaning on I'm like yeah
41:48 you are I'm being a [ __ ] yep yep time
41:51 to time for me to get my shitty key oh
41:53 yeah
41:54 site and and the nice thing is as soon
41:56 as they start kind of acknowledging you
41:58 know whatever it is they're going
42:00 through they know I'm right there they
42:03 know I'm like whatever you need man I
42:05 will help you to the extent I can and we
42:09 we work out it's why most of my friends
42:11 are doing great you know we all need to
42:13 vent right but on this show it's not
42:17 about that I don't know any of you
42:21 really even those of you I've had lots
42:25 of good chats with on the side I've even
42:27 Skype to probably half a dozen folks
42:29 that I think are wonderful people a lot
42:32 of which we have no differences that
42:33 matter at all and sometimes you know
42:36 sometimes what will happen is I give
42:38 people a platform to talk and I
42:41 represent them I don't believe what they
42:43 believe which is sort of where you get
42:45 to the flat earth side of things you
42:47 know my mind is open I don't know I
42:50 don't know I believe it's one way
42:53 because because in part it was
42:55 indoctrinated into me I do not believe
42:58 to be honest and this is something we
43:01 don't usually say I personally have no
43:05 proof with my eyes or any other sense
43:10 that I have that I'm on a round sphere I
43:14 don't I don't have any of that evidence
43:16 all I've got is pictures from an agency
43:19 that sells pictures for a living and
43:21 they make 80% if not 90% fake pictures
43:27 and sell it to the press as if it's real
43:30 so why the hell would I go to them to
43:33 certify something you know and again
43:35 these theories existed you know the
43:37 round earth spherical earth heliocentric
43:40 earth theories existed way before these
43:42 agencies existed it doesn't mean I think
43:45 it's flat it's just I have to
43:48 acknowledge what I know and what I don't
43:49 know and tone down the hubris and tone
43:53 down the indoctrination and the
43:54 knee-jerk opinion about things when it
43:58 comes to religion and God what I find
44:02 very fascinating about is that unlike
44:05 the community that is exploring Flat
44:07 Earth
44:08 where people wake up and they go yeah I
44:11 don't feel like I'm spending and there's
44:14 all these anomalies I want to go into
44:16 the beginners all kinds of pieces
44:19 evidence that seem to be either hearsay
44:22 or some observable things that we see
44:25 that makes us question where we are and
44:28 Christianity as an as an example because
44:31 again I just don't know enough about
44:33 other religions to really use it the
44:35 other religions as a as a place to jump
44:38 off in this conversation so I'm not
44:40 trying to pick on Christianity but I
44:43 think what I'm about to say about
44:44 Christianity is just as true for any
44:47 religion that believes in a similar in a
44:49 higher being and perhaps some sort of
44:51 need for salvation you don't know that's
44:56 the truth you may have had godlike
45:00 experiences and spiritual experiences I
45:02 am going to believe that completely but
45:06 you know save being asleep and having a
45:11 dream getting in some sort of high
45:14 chemical cocktail in your brain because
45:16 you're in some near-death experience
45:21 save dying and seeing your body and
45:23 floating away and then coming back most
45:28 of us haven't had those chronic
45:31 experiences and so there are those
45:32 severe experiences and so I can tell you
45:35 right now I've to my knowledge I've
45:37 never met God never heard his or her
45:41 voice I think I've had extremely
45:44 spiritual experiences I feel like I've
45:47 derived plenty of strength and wisdom
45:49 from the universe of which I would call
45:51 a God or God but in terms of the
45:54 Charlton Heston Bible version of it all
45:56 I don't have any of those experiences
46:00 you know and out of the tiny population
46:03 that was on earth when this stuff was
46:04 going down Jesus who didn't have a
46:07 perfect personal liaison with God it was
46:12 like it was no problem to walk into a
46:14 Plaza in Rome and go okay who's talked
46:16 to God okay okay you fifty people go
46:19 over here and everyone else that doesn't
46:21 have
46:21 personal experience with God you go over
46:23 here you know but you don't know and
46:30 because we don't know like if I'm
46:32 sitting with someone that it's all about
46:34 heliocentric Earth and I believe it's
46:37 heliocentric because of expanding earth
46:39 I think expanding earth needs to be 50
46:42 times bigger on the internet than it is
46:44 right now because I think it explains
46:46 every geographical anomaly that we see
46:49 out there and again it looks like when
46:53 you pull the continents together based
46:54 on the scenes in the bottom of the ocean
46:56 like I said in the previous episode it
46:59 it makes a ball it does it's just math
47:02 okay and there you can see it happen on
47:05 a disk maybe you can oh I don't know but
47:09 if I talk to a heliocentric person they
47:13 can yell at me or or yell about the
47:16 subject matter and say oh my god who the
47:18 [ __ ] whoever believes it's flat it's
47:19 just an idiot and da da da da da and I'm
47:24 just like well that's your choice man
47:27 it's your choice if you feel comfortable
47:29 with it being a ball then go for it just
47:31 go out there on this ball and be a good
47:33 person to other people help people guide
47:35 people and the same goes for the way
47:40 that religions are propagated hey if you
47:44 can be a good person a truly tolerant
47:47 person not your DN C tolerance which is
47:51 go out and have a fight then you're a
47:53 credit to your belief system and I
47:56 believe that you ever wanted to
47:57 evangelize and spread what you believe
48:01 then go for it you're going to be a
48:06 great example to the rest of us right
48:09 what I find very interesting and very
48:12 intriguing is that every time I've ever
48:14 spoken about Christianity or God well
48:19 it's well yes I guess they're both in
48:20 there and I want to chicken [ __ ] out of
48:21 the subject matter I am Telling You that
48:26 God is infinitely wonderful and doesn't
48:31 play games like man plays games there's
48:33 no eye for an eye
48:35 God's world right there's no anger
48:37 there's no punishment there's pure love
48:40 and peer understanding and there's pure
48:41 infinity we like to say and boast
48:46 through previously written words for us
48:48 that God had no beginning and no end
48:51 acknowledging God has an infinite being
48:54 but the second that we talk about God's
48:55 intellect
48:56 we immediately subtract that knowledge
48:59 and that characterization and that
49:00 credit to God and make him an idiot they
49:05 can more juvenile than the chieftain of
49:09 a tribe right one of the interesting
49:13 things that happened to me and sort of a
49:16 development way when I was in my 20s and
49:18 I was transitioning from being strictly
49:20 a senior engineer to being a manager of
49:23 other engineers and you know you know my
49:28 again like I'll just tell you my first
49:30 group was was sorry two people I was the
49:32 third we all cut code and the just
49:36 before I left and and started working
49:39 for myself about gas twelve years ago I
49:45 have 55 people I mean you know when you
49:50 say 55 people a the the thing I want you
49:53 to focus on is 55 different life's of
49:57 all different cultures I mean I had
50:00 people from all over the world
50:02 Russians people from Singapore in China
50:05 and Japan and all over America and the
50:07 Americas you know different enough all
50:09 from Europe and South America and India
50:11 and every place on planet Earth I had
50:14 them all in one roof I probably didn't
50:16 have an Aborigine it's probably only
50:18 what I didn't have right and they all
50:20 had cultural differences and they got
50:22 along beautifully because we're in
50:23 Electronic Arts which was you know one
50:27 of the most incredible places to work at
50:29 the time but something happened to me
50:32 that was very interesting and that was
50:33 that where I was a sort of well put this
50:38 way I was definitely drawn in before 25
50:40 into being sort of the complaining
50:43 employee at times you know I'd be
50:45 frustrated with executive management
50:47 of all different departments I thought
50:50 people would make good decisions and bad
50:51 decisions and the bad decisions seem
50:53 like you know a no-brainer but when I
50:58 became a manager of a ton of people it
51:01 was almost as if there was a spiritual
51:03 shift inside me where I was always calm
51:07 and I was always the peacemaker and
51:09 people would bring you know people come
51:11 into my office hysterical telling me I
51:14 should fire somebody and I actually you
51:18 know within my first six months to put
51:21 in perspective I had a COO on my hands
51:23 and I mentioned this a long time ago but
51:26 a bunch of employees came in who were
51:28 friends of a person who had left the
51:29 company and I lobbied to bring her back
51:31 and I work with her heavily to bring her
51:33 back and she immediately tried to get a
51:34 job in a different department within the
51:36 first day of being back because her
51:38 boyfriend hit who I helped get promote
51:41 to a different department was in there
51:42 and she want to go work side by side
51:43 with him and when they found out the
51:47 disloyalty that she had expressed they
51:52 came to be her friends who had worked
51:54 with her for some cases two years up to
51:59 that point told me I had to get rid of
52:02 her because they weren't going to work
52:04 with her and this was a very peaceful
52:06 company that doesn't have those kind of
52:07 coos and so I had to vet everything and
52:11 check everything out check out their
52:12 claims and sure enough the other hiring
52:14 manager walked up to me that night and
52:16 said you know so-and-so came over to me
52:19 and she asked me for a job and there's a
52:21 policy internally I got to talk to you
52:22 before I can poach your employee and I
52:24 said you know what
52:25 I just spent you know four months
52:28 lobbying with HR to create the position
52:30 that was high enough for her we even
52:33 created a new designation in the HR
52:34 catalog a level four artist and I got a
52:37 big giant paycheck for her that was
52:39 going to be higher than anyone had ever
52:41 been paid for that job and this was the
52:43 loyalty I got back within 24 hours and
52:46 so I called her and I basically said you
52:49 don't need to come in once you go take
52:50 that job in the other department since
52:52 you almost have it you know she didn't
52:54 get either job she was done and blamed
52:58 me for it of course
53:03 but the reason I mentioned this exercise
53:05 is that when I do this particular show
53:09 this isn't it's obviously all about my
53:12 opinion right I mean you know what I'm
53:14 trying to do though is aggregate our
53:16 different opinions and offer some some
53:20 crossover when that type of episode of
53:21 curs right we're talking about different
53:23 difference of opinions and that sort of
53:25 thing the other one that's interesting
53:29 is that I think it's pretty clear I
53:33 don't try to make episodes about things
53:35 I've lightly experienced or lightly
53:37 discussed now people give me these great
53:40 suggestions for episodes all the time
53:43 and I sort of cringe inside because I
53:47 realize they're right this is a really
53:49 amazing subject like the city of
53:51 Atlantis people want me to do that one
53:54 and I'm trying to figure out a way to to
53:57 sift through what's already on the
53:59 internet that's going to be better than
54:00 anything that I make right but if I
54:04 don't see something else
54:06 you know if I'm not enlightened in some
54:09 way and taking that information in and
54:10 sort of bringing I think a little bit
54:13 more focus and clarity to it I can't do
54:17 the the episode right religion for me is
54:21 a represents a backbone of my experience
54:25 of my research that is unlike probably
54:28 any other category of knowledge that I
54:31 have and I have categories where I have
54:33 tremendous rabbit holes that I dug
54:35 digging around and stuff you know I was
54:38 raised in the Catholic Church because
54:40 that's just what my family's believed in
54:42 as my mom's family and then I stopped
54:46 making me go to church at eight so then
54:48 I jumped into you know very deep into
54:53 physics of all kinds from Newtonian to
54:57 Einstein's [ __ ] and more of
55:01 Oppenheimer's quantum physics and just
55:03 really jumped in and then I went
55:05 cosmology I want a straw astronomy and
55:07 really tried to solve for where the hell
55:10 are we from the age of nine up and very
55:13 ver
55:14 intense readings I probably read more
55:17 stuff at nine to ten than most adults
55:19 have read an entire lifetime about the
55:21 subject unless this is something you are
55:22 passionate about right and I tried to
55:25 solve for God in science by 18 I you
55:31 know I was lured into a church because a
55:34 buddy in mind that I was roommate with
55:36 said my buddy's got a music studio you
55:38 want to come see it and I should sure
55:40 because I wanted to make more music and
55:45 it was a church and he was a you know
55:48 son of son-in-law of one of the people
55:50 in the church he turned out to be a
55:52 pedophile by the way it was convicted
55:53 and served two years in jail for after I
55:56 left he was a PhD eventually got his PhD
55:59 in and Bible studies and taught at
56:01 Pepperdine and was hauled out of that
56:03 place in handcuffs mm-hmm Christianity
56:08 did him a solid and we tell you but I
56:12 dove in into religion at a level that I
56:15 had dove into science but this time I
56:17 was smarter more strategic and I was
56:20 surrounded by Pepperdine University
56:22 professors and amazing elders who just
56:24 insisted to the stuff themselves and I
56:27 was writing book at the time that was
56:30 were very religious based and so I was
56:32 cannibalizing everything that I learned
56:34 and putting it into my story putting my
56:35 story right and so I chose to be
56:38 baptized at 19 and I stayed pretty into
56:41 it until about 21 22 years old and then
56:47 I popped out and I had to move because
56:49 the recession hit California moved to
56:51 the San Francisco area south of San
56:53 Francisco San Jose
56:54 Sunnyvale area and I stayed religious I
56:57 stayed you know
57:00 convicted to my Bible right and then I
57:05 started studying Egyptology probably I
57:07 don't remember what year 95 96 well
57:12 actually is probably 94 cuz when I
57:14 finally did not maybe 95 but I jumped in
57:17 deep and I mean I was obsessing from
57:21 this and I don't do this anymore at all
57:22 which is interesting YouTube is sort of
57:25 the new place - you know harvest
57:26 information and
57:28 that's the kind of the bud of which I'll
57:31 take information and then come back out
57:33 and get literary content but now you
57:35 know anything published at Barnes &
57:36 Noble is is you've got a you know almost
57:39 a unanimous percentage of being
57:41 propaganda and so what you have to do is
57:45 sift through the information and get
57:48 periodicals that come straight from the
57:49 source and there was a lot of Egyptian
57:52 archaeologists rags and San Francisco
57:55 was a great place because they they dig
57:57 this kind of stuff and so you could
57:58 always find it on the magazine shelf but
58:00 you go to LA you wouldn't see it you go
58:02 to the Midwest and you wouldn't see it
58:03 so I was really very very privileged and
58:05 I spent a tremendous amount of time in
58:07 Stanford reading papers and reading
58:10 research and buying basically academic
58:14 books and taking them home reading them
58:15 like normal books and so I gained a
58:19 really intense perspective from that
58:21 point on then in this particular century
58:24 we have people like dr. out well who
58:27 have come out with this typology theory
58:28 of Christ being a story written after
58:32 titus flavius so that added a tremendous
58:34 amount of perspective because I'm hungry
58:37 for the truth right I'm not hungry and
58:40 getting more and Doctrine aided by a
58:42 previous belief system now here's the
58:45 thing I always say on this show the
58:48 truth feels good when it goes through
58:50 your body and I believe that to be 100%
58:52 true and I believe that lies and deceit
58:55 feels negative and your system now there
59:00 could be a caveat to this where someone
59:02 says yeah well when I feel obligation to
59:04 do something I feel negative even though
59:07 it's what I should be doing so there's
59:09 there's a different type of it's almost
59:12 an exterior feel to your obligations
59:15 that you don't want to do and there's an
59:17 interior feel for believing something
59:20 fundamental to the universe that is
59:22 simply untrue right
59:26 for me personally when I fit down in I
59:29 meditate let's just say I sit out here I
59:31 put a little rug down or whatever to
59:33 don't own and I sit there and I meditate
59:35 I clear my mind there's no planes going
59:37 over there's no you know Fat Boy
59:39 Harley's going by neighbors aren't
59:42 making much noise maybe somewhere around
59:45 five o'clock in the morning maybe three
59:47 in the morning and if I insert into my
59:50 system the thought that I have a god
59:54 that creates original sin it is oil to
60:00 water you know it is the most repugnant
60:06 thought that I've ever had in my life
60:09 and it is so counter to any above-ground
60:14 definition of God so I save again those
60:18 that are very literal and wrathful that
60:24 I know I'm on the wrong track if I go
60:26 down that belief system the problem is
60:28 is once you remove that one lie in my
60:31 opinion that man made to control been it
60:36 unravels a tremendous amount of the
60:38 Bible's intent not all of it right again
60:41 morality is morality and this book of
60:43 nothing else is trying to temper man
60:46 from being chaotic and crazy all right I
60:51 have a story actually I need to recall
60:53 because I said I've never met God and I
60:56 think that if there's one caveat to that
61:00 claim it's when I again I've always say
61:06 on the show that I you know I haven't
61:07 had the Mormons come to my door in quite
61:09 a while but in 2011 they showed up and
61:12 Halloween the day after Halloween right
61:15 had my light off out front because I had
61:16 run out of candy the night before so
61:18 standing there in the dark ringing the
61:19 doorbell and I ended up talking to these
61:22 kids for about 11 months and I went
61:24 through several the missionaries because
61:26 they rotate and they go home and that
61:27 sort of thing but in the first month I
61:30 it was very straight forward them
61:32 because I was doing in kale to radio
61:34 show and I was just so knee deep and
61:36 everything
61:38 but I told them I said look I don't I
61:39 don't think Jesus ever existed I think
61:42 he's a wonderful person on paper and I
61:44 think that we all should read what he
61:46 had to say because I think again a lot
61:48 of his parables that are taken from
61:51 Egyptology and Sumerian texts that he
61:54 repeated which he's given utter credit
61:57 for as originating those are great those
62:00 are man's finest hour figuring out how
62:02 the world works sifting the truth out of
62:04 the universe and turning it into words
62:05 inspired by a creator but not exactly
62:09 the ones with the names that you've put
62:11 down on paper form right but they said
62:15 to me well would you do us a favor and I
62:20 said sure they said would you pray to
62:22 God and ask him if Jesus Christ is his
62:27 son and if the whole story of the Bible
62:30 is true I'm paraphrasing and I said yeah
62:34 it felt kind of weird immediately I felt
62:37 that feeling of a lie immediately fright
62:41 and I thought jeez I usually don't take
62:44 this kind of stuff to God because I
62:46 don't you know think it's the best use
62:48 of his time but sure okay fine I'll go
62:52 retro go back into my old belief systems
62:54 and ask that question and I think the
62:59 time table is about two weeks later I
63:02 think they have one visit before that
63:05 and then during the survivor just before
63:06 the second visit I had this experience
63:08 in this house
63:11 and again you're talking to a guy you're
63:13 listening to a guy that's basically
63:14 doesn't believe in ghosts necessarily I
63:17 believe in spirits but I don't think
63:18 I've ever seen them Sara Lee except for
63:20 Walt Disney here and there but nothing
63:21 like you know Casper the go showing up
63:24 with two eyes look into a sheet right
63:26 I'm being facetious but um I woke up in
63:32 my bed and it was daylight out my
63:35 girlfriend was in the house somewhere
63:36 messing around and visually speaking it
63:41 was very different it was it was almost
63:44 Hollywood I mean it was Hollywood I will
63:46 say this my my eyes whether they be
63:49 glazed by a night's sleep or
63:50 what-have-you
63:51 a very uncharacteristic of every other
63:54 morning I've awakened with the lights on
63:57 it was like a crystal filter like one of
64:01 these star filters I should say where
64:02 things looked a little bit more angelic
64:04 if you will which is sort of silly in my
64:06 opinion but it happened and I'm up there
64:08 and all I could hear was a feeling if
64:13 that makes sense and it essentially said
64:17 you have always been in my hand we have
64:21 always been together we have never been
64:23 apart if we were ever apart you wouldn't
64:27 exist so the mere fact that you know
64:30 that you exist is the answer that you're
64:32 really seeking here wild right it's one
64:38 of these statements that a smart design
64:40 might be it seemed to eclipse my own
64:42 ability to put it into words so for
64:46 anyone who's saying oh you're just
64:47 listening to your subconscious yeah I
64:49 would love to think that my subconscious
64:52 was that brilliant and that beautiful in
64:53 that poetic and again it was poetically
64:55 feeling it was a poetic feeling that
64:57 came over me you know but the problem
65:01 was is that the voice or the feeling or
65:04 whatever it wasn't a voice audible voice
65:05 but whatever was giving me this feeling
65:08 did not answer the question that these
65:11 Mormons wanted me to answer which was I
65:15 wanted God to answer for me which is his
65:17 Christ your son and so I'm sitting there
65:20 thinking I mean I'm feeling wonderful
65:22 I'm feeling amazing right
65:24 I've sitting there thinking Jesus is so
65:26 special but I have to go back in having
65:30 taken something from my Creator that was
65:33 beautiful and I have to kind of go back
65:34 as if it's not enough and in the end it
65:38 was enough for me in the beginning it
65:39 was plenty it was it was a sort of a
65:42 godly experience right and so I push
65:46 back I mean I literally pushed the
65:48 message back up what about Christ
65:51 these modern kids want me to ask you
65:52 about Christ and all I remember was I
65:56 was sort of holding myself up in the bed
65:58 looking down at the sheets just trying
66:00 to get out of bed but not getting out of
66:01 bed as to not
66:02 hang up the phone on this conversation
66:04 sort of right and the message came back
66:09 and it said who would want you to
66:12 believe that I would kill my only Son
66:16 and what do I see in my head projected
66:19 immediately a serpent in a tree and it
66:25 was the Luke I'm your father moment or
66:28 no I'm your father moment that they
66:30 always talk about in writing class where
66:31 the actor goes oh my god and that was it
66:36 that was the end of the conversation it
66:39 confirmed what wasn't true and I think
66:44 did a pretty damn good job of confirming
66:45 what is true and what was true was God
66:48 like simple infinite beautiful I am here
66:52 with you always and you've never been
66:54 without me and you need not ask man to
66:58 get closer to me you just need to take
67:00 care of yourself right you need to be
67:03 good and then you'll get as close as you
67:06 can get and you know it's sort of like a
67:09 subtextual insinuation that when you
67:12 come to the other side you will feel
67:14 better here the better you live a life
67:17 on earth and if you live a shitty life
67:19 on earth and you're an [ __ ] to
67:21 everybody and you step on heads to get
67:23 ahead whatever indoctrinated reason or
67:25 fear-mongering thing that you believe
67:27 yourself you're not going to be so
67:30 comfortable around those that didn't do
67:32 that right consequently it's probably
67:37 ironically related tolerant we are of
67:38 each other's differences regardless of
67:42 what you believe but at that point I was
67:46 awakened to a theory that I had never
67:49 considered for a second which is the
67:51 first scene and the first book was the
67:56 devil telling you what to believe the
68:00 clue is right in front of your face man
68:03 and man has been in control of man ever
68:06 since this book arrived and what's
68:10 interesting is for me there are no most
68:14 religions Islam and
68:16 various Muslims lady believe in a God
68:18 and that there are punishment they
68:20 believe in a very wrathful God and very
68:22 man-made God but I think most religions
68:26 walk around with just a rulebook of how
68:28 to behave so the Old Testament
68:30 technology but they do not believe that
68:32 they have to kill things in order to
68:34 kind of absolve their sin but before we
68:39 close out let's talk about that
68:41 algorithm right why would men create a
68:44 story of needing of original sin and the
68:48 need to sacrifice something to clear you
68:51 of your sins alright well how do you
68:56 feel when you [ __ ] someone else over how
68:59 do you feel how do you feel FG ly either
69:03 through embellishment of your own deeds
69:05 or concealing something you did against
69:08 another human being
69:09 perhaps the one you're talking to how do
69:11 you feel how do you feel when you know
69:13 you're supposed to do something but you
69:14 don't do it or you know you do it when
69:17 you're not supposed to do it does anyone
69:20 feel really great inside when you eat
69:22 the cake and you're already 80 pounds
69:24 overweight mm-hm
69:26 we don't feel very good do we and this
69:29 is what we call life life is full of
69:34 these moments and we need something talk
69:39 to a psychologist talk to talk to a
69:41 psychiatrist and ask them about patients
69:45 that come in with just guilt dripping
69:48 out of their ears of what sort of
69:51 rehabilitation that they need they need
69:54 to stop feeling guilty you know I think
69:58 in the most absolute sentence they need
69:59 to go back and clear the slate they need
70:02 to tell people that they lied to that
70:03 they lied and apologized like you see at
70:05 the end of every sitcom right and hell
70:07 most movies nowadays everyone kisses and
70:10 makes up it's an age-old formula for
70:14 storytelling it's all over Hollywood but
70:18 we needed some form of ritualized
70:21 sequence in our life too to get this
70:25 pressure off of our chest
70:28 and sadly I think that religion has
70:33 allowed us to to sort of become not so
70:39 good to each other right let's just say
70:41 you're it's the 1500s you live in Europe
70:47 inquisitions all over the place right
70:48 right and you are merchants and you know
70:54 life is hard because the king or queen
70:56 and and all these legions are taking
70:59 your money
70:59 taking your tax money the biggest guy in
71:01 the the village doesn't like you and so
71:04 you kind of roughs you up every time you
71:05 try to walk from your your shop to your
71:08 house you don't know if he's going to
71:10 kill your kids and there's a plague
71:11 going around me it's just a weird world
71:13 and so you have to do things when you
71:17 sell products you have to screw some
71:18 people with prices that are way too high
71:20 and other times you can cut somebody
71:22 some slack negotiate down all right but
71:26 every day you kind of feel like a chump
71:27 because you're not being a good person
71:29 when it comes to the global picture of
71:32 how humanity might behave but you're
71:33 doing what you got to do to survive now
71:37 if you have a paradigm in which you can
71:42 exhaust all that guilt in a confession
71:45 booth at a Catholic Church you're
71:47 telling a preacher what you did
71:48 understand go home and do all these
71:50 different prayers and rituals and
71:52 what-have-you but you keep bringing in
71:54 the same sins every Sunday what's
71:59 happening there you're getting it off
72:02 your chest but you're not becoming a
72:03 better person you're just getting it off
72:06 your chest think about all the
72:09 pedophilia that runs around inside
72:11 churches and I know that no one in their
72:13 right mind who's a normal Christian
72:15 sanctions any of that behavior trust me
72:18 I'm not dragging you into that realm but
72:20 for people that did bad things killed
72:22 somebody raped somebody all they had to
72:25 do was come into the confession booth
72:27 probably need to donate to Rome but you
72:30 come in and you confess and you're
72:31 cleared it doesn't bring the person back
72:35 to life it doesn't give a rape victim
72:37 back their sanity it doesn't give back
72:40 the money to the
72:41 bought something from you that you
72:43 screwed so society is injured that
72:46 you're not and that's the functional
72:49 paradigm that the old-school Catholicism
72:53 facilitate now again we don't unless
72:55 you're Catholic you don't have this sort
72:57 of ability what I'm saying is it you
73:03 know according to my research according
73:06 to my logic God is much more forgiving
73:10 than that but God leaves it right in
73:13 your lap you did something wrong he just
73:17 says go fix it because you will die and
73:21 even if you do reincarnate you're going
73:24 to be up here with everybody you flopped
73:26 and you're going to be you're going to
73:29 be forced to in fact if not even you
73:32 don't have the this is where I perceive
73:34 it you won't need to confess it to these
73:36 people because you can't be in that
73:38 afterlife in a ball of lies and that
73:42 afterlife if we maintain any any
73:45 knowledge of ever being human to begin
73:48 with maybe we don't your overall
73:50 frequency is going to be a little weird
73:52 right now maybe the beauty of being
73:56 infinitely brilliant is simply you go to
73:58 the other side and just leaving your
74:00 mortal coil and heading up to that
74:03 bright spot in the universe as a
74:05 metaphor all of your deeds from your
74:11 life just strip off of you they're
74:13 irrelevant and you're just in the other
74:17 side the pure soul that you were before
74:20 you were born
74:20 returns unscathed perhaps hopefully
74:25 wiser nicer even if you were a bastard
74:29 you realize immediately upon exiting
74:32 your body that you were a bastard but it
74:35 was due to being beat up and messed with
74:37 as a child and you're no longer a part
74:41 of that world everything that made you
74:43 weird is gone now and so what's the
74:47 point in talking about it what's the
74:50 point in paying penance for it what's
74:53 the point of hell
74:54 all right again there's a great Twilight
74:56 Zone which I just watched the other day
74:59 I try to remember the name of it but I
75:00 forgot it's about the bank robber who or
75:04 whatever he's that he's a thief he
75:06 steals a bunch of stuff he goes outside
75:08 he gets shot by the cops and then this
75:10 you know heavyset guy shows up in white
75:13 outfit and says you know come with me
75:16 the guys very suspect of him he takes
75:19 him to a palacios penthouse suite and
75:20 says all this is yours and he doesn't
75:23 believe and he tries to shoot him and he
75:24 realizes he can't die and he goes oh my
75:25 god he goes I've gone to the other side
75:29 half and I he's like yes sir you're
75:31 you're no longer alive in that world but
75:32 your life here and you could have
75:33 whatever you want and the beautiful
75:37 nature of this Twilight Zone is that
75:39 they have this guy in what man refers to
75:44 as heaven he gets anything he wants you
75:47 can do anything he wants you can eat as
75:49 much as you want to have as much sex as
75:51 he once he can play poker win all the
75:54 time because that's what heaven is right
75:56 they might subtract sex but you get what
76:00 you want you live in a blissful
76:01 existence forever by the time the
76:06 episodes over he realizes he didn't go
76:08 to heaven he went to hell that the
76:13 choice that you have in heaven that the
76:15 choice you have on earth didn't exist in
76:18 hell I've never known anyone to define
76:22 heaven as a place where you can lose or
76:25 you can be unhappy or you can make a bad
76:29 choice you're almost by design forbidden
76:32 from making bad choices I think you get
76:36 what I'm saying right we're not alike
76:40 none of us are alike and that's what
76:42 makes the world infinite and beautiful
76:45 flat or spherical that's the gift that
76:50 God gave us if you believe God is
76:53 wrathful then that is your belief and if
76:58 that makes you a good person then that's
77:00 what you need to motivate you I find it
77:04 much more enlightening and intense to
77:07 believe that God is put it on my lap as
77:10 an adult and says you know what's right
77:12 you know what's wrong now live your life
77:15 and I think you understand what will be
77:18 really valuable when you get here what
77:24 kind of life that you needed to have
77:25 lived when you get here and I think you
77:29 know what life you do not want to live
77:31 before you come here and I think that us
77:38 loving each other is probably in right
77:41 at the top if not at the tippy tippy top
77:44 of what we can do within this paradigm
77:46 right loving God would be perhaps zero
77:49 you know number one the first thing in
77:52 the number said the absolute just below
77:55 that priority list it's us loving each
77:58 other being tolerant of each other right
78:00 I always say to my friends and family
78:03 that sin is intent right I think that
78:08 most of you understand I'm not trying to
78:10 misguide any of you right everyone so a
78:13 lot of people call me a shill go watch
78:16 my episode on chill and you can have a
78:19 conversation about that most the time if
78:23 anyone's rubber on and they get rubber
78:25 on and they move on or they get rubber
78:27 on and they have the patience and
78:31 tolerance to watch a few more episodes
78:34 or get through the one that they're
78:35 having a problem with and sometimes they
78:37 come around and I think I got y'all
78:39 wrong man you know I saw your long hair
78:41 I thought you're an [ __ ] but I
78:44 listened and it wasn't so bad after all
78:46 right you know I don't do this in front
78:49 of a live audience right and I don't you
78:52 know sit on the edge of my seat to find
78:54 out how many people liked my video or
78:56 comment on the video you know it is
78:59 fascinating when a video gets a lot of
79:01 counts it's really fast I just 100 Flat
79:03 Earth you know it's over a thousand it's
79:05 not even a week old I have cut videos
79:08 that are you know two years old they
79:10 can't get over 500 which I think are in
79:12 some of my best videos but you know
79:14 season one is just a mess you know in
79:16 terms of getting the microphone right I
79:18 had the microphone right against my
79:19 mouth I have found some soft
79:21 to fix audio but unfortunately YouTube
79:23 doesn't let me swap out of videos so if
79:25 I repost it'll be very confusing to
79:27 someone coming in to see a bunch of
79:28 seasoned ones at the top so that's why I
79:31 have vid me where I actually
79:33 reengineered the sound for a lot of
79:34 things someone just made a comment that
79:36 episode 2 was almost inaudible he's
79:40 absolutely correct and the dummy has a
79:43 better version of the fact when I was
79:45 remastering it for vid dummy I would
79:47 pull up the audio and look at it and it
79:49 was so low on the gain scale that I was
79:52 surprised that I ever published in the
79:54 first place but I know what the hell I
79:55 was doing at that point because I always
79:58 made it an audio file for radio but
80:03 anyway hopefully this is valuable you
80:04 know if you're angered by something I
80:08 say in the video I you know I do
80:10 apologize if I knew you better you know
80:13 I obviously probably wouldn't go down
80:14 certain rabbit holes in front of you I
80:16 would respect that we have differences I
80:18 got friends in mind that are extreme
80:19 extremely religious that I smoked cigars
80:21 with and when they're in the room I
80:23 respect their beliefs and I know it's
80:25 way different than mine and I really
80:28 just try to stay on the conversation or
80:31 where we have a commonality I'll even
80:33 talk you know I'll jump into the
80:35 conversation for 10-15 minutes as if I'm
80:38 a Christian and I and I celebrate their
80:40 various belief systems and mechanisms
80:42 because there are things that I believe
80:43 have value I just don't go as far as to
80:46 say you know that the Christ is my
80:48 particular Savior that's all you know so
80:53 again this is an organic process that
80:55 we're going through again for those of
80:57 you who are longtime commenters you know
80:59 I would appeal to you to continue
81:01 spreading your word and your beliefs
81:04 within the comments and just understand
81:06 there's going to be people tons of
81:07 people that view your comment and go
81:09 yeah yeah this guy he's lost in this
81:11 area and this guy he's commenting right
81:13 here this girl he or she has it right
81:16 and that's where I am with that
81:18 particular belief system right again
81:21 meandering deep thoughts radio.com for
81:25 all the fees there's video if you're an
81:26 audio audio if you're on video there's a
81:29 locked Facebook group there's vid me for
81:33 a completely remastered season one where
81:37 again you can see it without being cut
81:39 off by YouTube I think that's about it
81:42 so why don't you take care of yourself
81:44 and someone else and we will see each
81:46 other again on detox over now
