00:30 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:32 deep thoughts so as you know as I'm
00:37 sitting around searching for subjects
00:39 there's been one that's been brought up
00:41 several times in my lifetime but
00:45 especially since the Internet has done
00:48 its thing two stories and one of them is
00:53 this rumor that the Nazis went to the
00:57 Antarctica for those of you who are
01:00 really bad in geography that's the South
01:01 Pole and created a secret military base
01:04 and then all hell breaks loose in terms
01:08 of the story so I've been doing some
01:10 deep dives looking around trying to see
01:13 what the story is down there boy are
01:17 they a wild they're wild stories now if
01:21 you've never had this show before never
01:22 seen the show before excuse me and
01:24 you're like okay just get to the point
01:26 of all things
01:27 this isn't your quick warm fuzzy guy you
01:30 know talking a Qi double hockey sticks
01:34 kind of video but you will get all the
01:37 well you won't get at all oh my god how
01:40 could you get it all in one video but
01:41 we're gonna go through a lot so we're
01:44 gonna kind of clear up some history
01:46 because what they did at various polls
01:51 was very well documented by a lot of
01:54 different folks and even themselves
01:55 remember the Germans really did document
01:57 quite a bit but I was actually
02:00 fascinated when I jumped into some of
02:03 the historic issues and we will
02:07 definitely address the fact that you
02:09 know one of the anti conspiracy tactics
02:13 is to say no no no it's all true and
02:16 it's just been you know off you skated
02:21 retold revised if that's one of your
02:25 worries
02:26 we had a very safe place because we do
02:29 deal with issues like that and of course
02:31 there's always if someone's trying to
02:34 protect information the they have all
02:36 the money and all the press and all the
02:37 books
02:38 and they own all the algorithms behind
02:41 video technologies and so unless you're
02:44 over in something like [ __ ] shoot or
02:46 minds.com
02:46 where they don't play with algorithms
02:48 then you can't speak the truth about a
02:52 lot of different things without your
02:53 stuff getting banned you're getting
02:56 suspended for 24 hours for a week all
02:58 that kind of stuff so just understand
03:01 that you're in good company with that it
03:03 doesn't mean I'm gonna agree with
03:04 everything with this particular
03:07 storyline I'm gonna basically stitch
03:11 together some of the above-ground stuff
03:14 then we're gonna do what we do on this
03:16 show which is obviously talk about it
03:18 and apply as much sort of logic as we
03:22 can to what would happen if these rumors
03:25 were true because I think a lot of in a
03:27 lot of cases you know it's kind of like
03:32 if someone said there was time travel
03:35 for instance and that a particular group
03:36 of people actually had linear time
03:39 travel meaning they're going to travel
03:42 within this particular time line then
03:44 those folks would be gods on earth
03:48 because nothing could stop them they
03:49 would always know exactly what's gonna
03:52 happen just like Groundhog Day they just
03:53 keep going back going back until they
03:55 figured out or the amazing Tom Cruise
03:58 movie edge of tomorrow which still goes
04:01 down in history as my favorite movies
04:02 ever done well the most brilliantly
04:04 written scripts on planet earth and it's
04:06 got a Groundhog Day element to it and so
04:10 we don't really see into those factions
04:12 we don't have to worship some loc-nar
04:16 holding dude we're free to kind of [ __ ]
04:19 up our lives and you know yes there's a
04:21 lot of rich people but I don't think
04:23 they want us on this planet at this
04:24 point and so the fact that we still
04:26 exist means they don't have ultimate
04:28 control so just want to lay that out
04:32 there is kind of a foundational thing
04:33 especially for new listeners so just as
04:37 a beginners introduction to like the
04:42 overall storyline that's going on here
04:45 yeah the odd thing was is that I never
04:48 heard about the Arctic base
04:51 so the Arctic is the North Pole
04:52 Antarctic meaning ante is the South Pole
04:57 all the rumors the people are concerned
05:00 about are that I've ever heard I mean
05:02 maybe you've heard something different
05:03 but all the the big heavy et Cthulhu
05:07 crazy things are all down in this in the
05:10 South Pole and the North Pole was never
05:14 ever mentioned in any of the stuff I've
05:16 ever heard but as you get into it you
05:18 get into the history and the fact that
05:21 these locations have been discovered and
05:23 you know very little was ever built in
05:27 the Antarctica and we're gonna get into
05:30 some of the the other sort of tangential
05:34 things
05:35 Flattr things and what-have-you I did
05:38 want to tell you just right off the bat
05:39 for those of your flutter Thurs one of
05:42 my closest friends and screenplay
05:45 researchers is a geologist and she spent
05:48 three weeks in the Antarctica just doing
05:53 ice samples and that sort of thing as
05:54 part of her education her internship and
05:57 that sort of thing was it tumultuous
05:59 trip with like three months of
06:00 preparation and different prepping
06:02 stations before she even flew down there
06:05 and she said you know the whole time I
06:07 was there was sunlight you know it was a
06:09 big pain in the ass to sleep because
06:12 your body knows it's sunlight out if you
06:15 want to go inside buildings they had you
06:17 know tints that were absolutely light
06:19 proof so you could have kind of a
06:20 nightclub feel in a tiny tent you want
06:24 to see a movie it's you know it's bunch
06:26 of technology to make sure it's dark
06:27 enough so with your flat earth model
06:29 that circles this big ice shield down
06:33 there it doesn't happen you know there's
06:35 like conspiracy videos about clocks that
06:37 are being filmed and you never see go 24
06:39 hours and and well I just have a friend
06:43 he's done it so bear that in mind folks
06:47 so the the first real base that was
06:53 established was in the Arctic about a
06:55 thousand miles from Russia
06:59 it was secretly built for one reason and
07:03 one reason alone which was to study
07:04 weather pattern
07:05 because they understood that a big
07:08 portion of this war was gonna be fought
07:10 in the waters and of course the Germans
07:13 had mastered submarines which they
07:15 called u-boats
07:16 I mean mastered it they mastered
07:18 everything if you really get into deep
07:21 German engineering history that's
07:24 outside of a Nazi regime or Nazi war you
07:28 know you're talking about by the 1920s
07:30 the German engineering was ahead in
07:35 every single category of engineering
07:37 worldwide and so as they kept even
07:41 though where they were impoverished by
07:42 World War one and a crashing economy
07:45 that really hit the tank about 1935
07:48 we're getting a loaf of bread cost
07:51 $500,000 which you have to have a wheel
07:53 barrel to purchase it with normal
07:55 currency there's a reason why even with
07:59 money you don't get technology right you
08:02 have to have the brains you had the
08:03 genetics to pull this thing off and so
08:05 as they got funded all the blueprints
08:07 were ready to create their their naval
08:11 fleets their Air Force and all their
08:14 tanks and all of the gear that they wore
08:17 their machine guns were the best in the
08:18 world I mean it just got it was crazy
08:21 how amazing these folks were at the time
08:23 and of course we love their Mercedes and
08:25 BMWs and other things right my cars
08:28 engines made in Germany
08:31 the weather was something that was going
08:33 around the war circuits meaning generals
08:37 and commanders of all forces we're
08:40 constantly talking about okay you know
08:42 if it's gonna be rainy we can't do a
08:44 bombing run we you know accurately
08:46 anyway because resources are limited you
08:50 can't just lit up a plane with a bunch
08:51 of bombs as guys go and drop it I mean
08:53 if you're doing a shock and awe thing
08:54 that's great but if you don't wipe out
08:56 and they're an Air Force strip bomb boat
09:00 in the water properly then you've wasted
09:02 your ammunition which is gonna take time
09:05 to reconstitute and you could lose the
09:07 war in the meantime so they don't want
09:09 to play around so again you know a lot
09:11 of the generals too that you know they
09:13 read as much as they possibly can about
09:14 previous experiences that's you know if
09:17 you go to West Point
09:19 you're sitting inside you know war
09:21 history because you're being bred to be
09:24 a general you're bred to be a Admiral on
09:27 the Navy and so you know weather has
09:32 always been a big factor in taking out
09:34 ships you know how many times in history
09:36 class did you hear you know the British
09:38 were gonna kick this Spaniards asses but
09:40 this ship knocked them all out and then
09:42 vice versa you know the Asian fleets
09:45 have had tons of issues too so everyone
09:46 has suffered due to weather so this base
09:50 that was established in the Arctic was
09:53 called alexandra land and it was
09:58 established by using you to your so
10:01 u-boats excuse me thank you two boats
10:03 there you go
10:04 Bono's like what no u-boats that snuck
10:08 underneath all of the ships to then pop
10:12 up at this remote location offload all
10:14 these individuals to build a small base
10:17 figure out what's going on but the base
10:20 which has was discovered in a belief
10:26 nineteen forty eight we discovered the
10:29 base and started raiding the place but
10:31 they were long gone because of a sort of
10:36 a tapeworm II kind of parasite that was
10:39 inside polar bear meat that they think
10:44 the polar bear ate a seal and seals are
10:47 known for having this I guess ailment
10:48 and it was causing a lot of sickness and
10:50 so they radioed in a rescue request in
10:55 1944 everyone was offloaded
10:57 what-have-you but when they got up there
11:01 they found you know complete normal base
11:04 arsenal with you know mines and
11:06 ammunition and coats and then tons of
11:09 just meteorological data written down
11:11 and they were radioing this stuff down
11:14 to Germany and so you know just trying
11:19 to figure out how the weather worked
11:21 they even had like weather balloons and
11:24 just the full arsenal of everything that
11:26 was there so it's a very you know in
11:29 terms of UFOs and in other
11:32 supernatural things that are associated
11:35 with the South Pole base this North Pole
11:38 base was very standard boring in terms
11:42 of being entertained by this stuff now
11:46 before we go to the Antarctic story I
11:48 just want to lay in a little sort of
11:50 footnote here for our brains are we I
11:53 mean think about the way we just do a
11:57 couple you know
11:58 Delta's for your brain here it's 1980
12:01 you turn on the TV
12:03 how many channels do you have three to
12:06 four depending on where you live three
12:08 to four they totally controlled
12:11 everything that we saw in terms of
12:13 entertainment news everything then by
12:16 1985 Holmes had 100 channels then by
12:20 1995 you have potentially it's hard to
12:23 actually fill it up at least your your
12:25 tuning box had a thousand channels right
12:28 had the capability of at least giving
12:29 you a thousand we all know it's all
12:31 [ __ ] there's you know out of a
12:33 thousand maybe there was fifty that you
12:36 might watch you know they have your
12:38 course staple stuff there'd be like four
12:40 CBS's and three you know ABC's you know
12:45 different times different shows that
12:46 kind of stuff but anyway now we have oh
12:50 and I would say to you only saw movies
12:52 in 1980 primarily in a movie theater
12:55 then by the mid eighties you'd be
12:57 actually about three to six months later
12:59 you get the VHS tape and you get the
13:03 movie in your house by the 90s it's blue
13:05 it's uh sorry DVDs towards the end of
13:09 the 90s you got two blu-rays and so now
13:13 we have huge home entertainment systems
13:15 and so in the 21st century by 2010 you
13:19 got Netflix creating their own movies in
13:22 the last five years
13:23 Apple's jumped on board Amazon jumped on
13:25 board Hulu's jumped on board and they
13:27 have to fill up the whole thing with
13:29 legacy stuff and that's not even talking
13:31 about HBO cinemax
13:33 you know stars all these other ones
13:35 they've been around forever and so now
13:38 in one night you can or I should say and
13:42 maybe a week you can consume
13:44 all of Westworld 20 episodes one hour
13:47 apiece
13:49 okay that's a tremendous amount of work
13:53 writing production takes months and
13:55 months and months to even just film the
13:57 principal footage after years of
13:59 preparation and so and so as we ingest
14:05 these conspiracies a lot of us I think
14:09 are just wanting to be entertained and
14:11 there's this there's two different
14:12 factors to being entertained if I told
14:15 you a story like a Nazi base in
14:18 Antarctica and I as I'm gonna tell you
14:21 what really happened here which is
14:23 boring and they're gonna get into the
14:25 you know more advanced stuff and then
14:27 apply logic to it
14:29 see where we can go with that if you
14:32 thought it was all fake
14:34 then you have a certain rise in your and
14:36 your endorphins in your mind if you
14:40 thought was fake but if I told you it
14:42 was true at the end of the story or I
14:43 saved the very beginning of what I'm
14:45 about to tell you is true
14:46 and dented - done I got an uncle and I
14:48 did it all know this stuff for a fact
14:50 because they were in the US military and
14:52 they wouldn't discovered this stuff it's
14:53 Donald Trump's uncle picking up Tesla's
14:56 stuff and inventing a time machine and
14:57 all that kind of stuff
14:58 well how much the door friends dumping
15:01 in your body then and because we had
15:04 become this short attention span theater
15:06 society well we need a hit don't we and
15:11 so if I come in and say something is not
15:13 true when you've been taking that you
15:17 know that meth of that particular
15:19 conspiracy but then I'm the bad guy
15:22 right say you know take it down take it
15:25 down find something else now the Nazis
15:30 did create an Antarctic base they did
15:35 they got this dude named alfred ritscher
15:38 i guess his name and he was a captain
15:45 that was very versed in arctic
15:49 navigation you know generally what it
15:52 took to run a vessel in these hostile
15:55 environments
15:56 and they essentially had one goal which
16:00 is totally non romantic and then I'm
16:03 sure without a doubt there's a ton of
16:06 other goals I mean why not it's just a
16:10 first swipe but there was some land down
16:14 there that was cleaned by Norway very
16:18 you know it's it's a it's a big
16:20 continent danish 12,000 miles around man
16:22 I mean it's gigantic down there and so a
16:25 lot of folks had kind of gone down to
16:27 the easier spots to drive into and they
16:31 set up shop and they claimed land and
16:33 that kind of thing and so you know but
16:35 it's no one stays there until you know
16:38 probably God the 80s were they start
16:41 setting up bases and they could figure
16:42 out you know trade well not trade routes
16:44 but routes of supply missions and that
16:46 kind of stuff and what needed to be
16:47 there so this is like the Wild West down
16:51 there at this point if you showed up and
16:54 the other dude had left you can take his
16:55 house you can live in his log cabin so
16:58 to speak great but uh and again some of
17:03 you might think this is a cover story
17:04 and I welcome all videos that you think
17:06 are more conclusive on this because you
17:10 know we're gonna get the cool stuff here
17:12 in just a few minutes but let's get rid
17:14 of the official story about Antarctica
17:18 this abomination called margarine which
17:23 is an oil-based whale oil based products
17:27 at the time was extremely popular in
17:30 Europe and I mean all countries
17:32 including England it was fairly popular
17:36 in the Midwest and America to know if
17:40 you had grandmothers like mine
17:41 matter of fact they had one grandmother
17:43 was like don't ever eat that crap it's
17:45 it's [ __ ] don't eat it and the other
17:47 grandma was like ha this is great you
17:48 know and then why don't we butter I'll
17:52 live the other two so there's a few
17:55 things going on because there was a lot
18:00 of hostilities in the area getting well
18:03 oil was rough plus the well oil industry
18:07 had exploded for a number of reasons all
18:09 of them related
18:10 - the use of whale oil and so the herds
18:12 of whales had actually been reduced
18:14 quite a bit in the northern hemisphere
18:17 and equatorial regions right and so the
18:20 way in whilst in a hangout in cooler
18:22 water because they're big blubbery
18:24 things that I'm sure they get nice and
18:25 warm and warm temperatures in the oceans
18:28 they tend to go north they tend to go
18:29 south right so the logical thing was
18:32 that plenty of people had fished whales
18:34 out of the southern hemisphere and so
18:37 Hitler and wanting to maintain this
18:41 supply of whale oil which I'm sure he
18:43 used for every again reason I don't know
18:46 I don't personally know how well oil
18:48 might be metabolized into things that
18:50 would be used for war but um you know
18:52 rubber boots arrived like a finery but
18:55 he sends a group of folks because the
18:59 whole world was going south for whales
19:01 at the time and so he's like okay we're
19:04 gonna get this boat and we're gonna go
19:08 down and get some you know a reliable
19:12 source of well wool of one of the major
19:14 benefits is margarine now because
19:17 they're down there they know that
19:19 they're they need to maintenance the
19:21 ship's quite a bit and so they gotta
19:26 build a base just a real good you know
19:29 stop and do it base now this boat that
19:31 they took down their cache and want to
19:33 brutalize the name of this thing the
19:36 Schwab inland boat it embarked on
19:40 December 17th 1938 to go down and start
19:44 establishing this trade down there well
19:48 to get the the whales it had two boats
19:51 on them sorry two planes on them excuse
19:54 me I think the planes are called Dornier
19:57 planes that's so they would launch off
20:00 the boat with this catapult and then
20:03 they'd fly over and land on on the
20:05 ground so they could start taking
20:08 supplies over
20:10 so they're whaling they're claiming land
20:14 that Norway claimed and there's a couple
20:16 ways that they did the the claiming of
20:18 the land which was sort of actually one
20:20 major way but of course just living
20:22 there is one methodology and you know I
20:24 don't think no it was gonna go down and
20:26 have a fistfight with Germany but they
20:31 would take these little tiny swastikas
20:33 little metal swastikas throw them out of
20:36 the plane all over the land and if you
20:39 just happen to be walking by and you see
20:42 one of these things pick it up you know
20:43 you're in this land that at least the
20:44 Germans think that they now possess
20:46 right and there's an old story about how
20:50 and one of the plane rides they have
20:54 done really low on fuel and the only way
20:56 that you can counteract a low fuel tank
20:58 is to lighten the aircraft so it takes
21:02 less power to keep it in the air and so
21:04 they threw a bunch of boxes of these
21:06 things out the out the door and there's
21:09 a joke that you know I'm sure they
21:11 killed penguins down below which is kind
21:13 of funny so the boat that they took down
21:17 there was converted to be an icebreaker
21:19 which is obviously just reinforcing the
21:22 hull making it extremely heavy in the
21:24 front especially so that it just runs up
21:26 on the ice and it crushes it runs up and
21:28 crushes it and you know the ice gets
21:30 several meters thick so you know you
21:32 guys have seen those videos that are
21:34 pretty wild of them doing this but now
21:37 they're down they're only for about a
21:39 year this is what's fascinating about
21:41 the story they're physically down there
21:44 for one year which you can't do [ __ ] in
21:47 one year I mean seriously you can and
21:49 they're very famous for coming back with
21:53 this boat which really didn't have I
21:55 don't I would imagine it had much use
21:57 during the war but they came back with
21:59 the fleet I think they really wanted the
22:01 personnel if anything else and they
22:03 ended up mapping the bottom of the
22:05 Atlantic Ocean and finding the volcanic
22:07 scene we're expanding earth explains the
22:10 new plates come out of the ground as
22:13 volcanic popping because it's seen
22:15 that's why the Atlantic Ocean exists it
22:19 ripped at one point at the top and then
22:21 as these
22:23 this big giant solid ball of continent
22:26 started getting torn apart one in the
22:28 Pacific one in the Atlantique starts to
22:30 spread out of course although
22:31 sedimentary rocks gonna fall down into
22:33 the crack and then it starts to fill up
22:35 with water and that's how you get an
22:37 ocean and that's how you don't have
22:39 Pangaea drift but while they're down
22:41 there you know they're their mapping
22:43 mountains they're doing as many
22:46 experiments as possible now the one
22:48 thing that they don't have the evidence
22:50 of is the same sort of weather
22:52 meteorology that they did in that
22:54 northern base and the Arctic and you
22:58 know but you also have to understand
23:00 that the temperatures of which they're
23:02 dealing with our way colder in the south
23:05 region however they did find the couple
23:09 clearings where due to the terrain there
23:14 are some really warm spots relative to
23:16 the rest of the island and they weren't
23:18 covered in ice which is very interesting
23:20 or snow so that's the official story of
23:24 why that base was made why it never
23:26 attained any sizable you know magnitude
23:30 but you know you see movies like Indiana
23:33 Jones which I believe they had you know
23:35 Arctic base the submarine you know big
23:38 heavy concrete structures you know the
23:41 amount of materials they would have had
23:43 to brought down there to build the stuff
23:45 that you've seen in fiction is you know
23:47 massive a huge fleet and you have to
23:50 understand that you have a lot of whale
23:52 ships whaling ships in the area from
23:54 other countries plus when you move
23:57 things in the ocean well there's
23:58 constantly shipping you know freight
24:02 lanes over the ocean and so you have
24:04 trade going all the way down in Africa
24:07 crossing the ocean to various regions in
24:10 the area I mean the slaves got here 400
24:13 years before that's by sailing from
24:15 Africa to North America so I mean we had
24:19 very very established routes so if you
24:21 just had a bunch of Nazis just hey
24:24 what's going on why is that Armada going
24:25 south you know keep an eye on them okay
24:28 it would have it would have changed
24:29 history for the official history of all
24:32 of our countries right and that would
24:34 have led to a much bigger mystery if
24:36 someone took a picture
24:37 of an armada of ships big heavy ships
24:41 right with all these catapulted planes
24:43 off of them and little you know cranes
24:45 to lift over stuff just the whole
24:47 construction gear to make this happen
24:49 now if anyone could have built the base
24:50 the Germans would have been the probably
24:53 the most sophisticated group of people
24:55 on planet earth to pull it off with the
24:57 least amount of expenditure but even
25:00 with that alkylate they can't possibly
25:02 do it without bringing big equipment
25:04 right now at the same time other
25:08 countries are also putting bases down
25:10 there but when we say bases let's let's
25:14 get a little bit of perspective here you
25:16 look up stuff today and you'll see some
25:18 pretty amazing elaborate you know sort
25:21 of Lego bases down there that are on
25:23 sleds and all kinds of wild stuff but
25:26 1930s a base was essentially I think the
25:32 biggest kind of building they might have
25:34 built down there would have been a
25:37 two-story manor house in England you
25:40 know maybe 50 feet wide 15 20 feet deep
25:43 two storeys pitch roof one 12 pitch roof
25:47 or maybe it was of done yeah would have
25:50 been really steep but there were some
25:55 interesting things that started to
25:57 happen around the time of the end of the
26:02 war there's two u-boats the you five-30
26:07 and the you 997 which surrendered
26:10 themselves in Argentina and I think it
26:15 was a couple years after the war they
26:17 did this and you know for those of you
26:21 have studied the the actual
26:26 eventualities of Hitler and his men but
26:28 especially Hitler and this was joked
26:32 about for years in the 60s and 70s that
26:36 he was allowed to to live out his life
26:40 in Argentina now the most convincing
26:44 documentaries I think are less than ten
26:46 years old where they went down there and
26:48 and interviewed folks
26:51 we're very very young at the time who
26:54 were like probably my parents age at the
26:58 time where they worked in the diner's
27:00 they worked in the area this town where
27:02 he lived and there's photographs of him
27:05 old the general consensus from all that
27:10 research and there was a guy that
27:12 actually wrote a book way back in that
27:14 timeframe the claim that Hitler did end
27:17 up living in Argentina and they of
27:20 course they smoked him away and say that
27:22 he was lying or whatever they just call
27:25 it fiction because they're in their mind
27:28 without proof then it's not true but
27:33 with the internet proof is a whole
27:34 different game finding eyewitnesses and
27:37 video you know taping them or whatever
27:39 recording them and putting together you
27:42 know even a little documentary from a
27:44 student it was very doable but I've
27:48 personally seen the interviews with
27:49 these individuals and we're not talking
27:50 about you know your your conspiratorial
27:53 person who's selling a t-shirt or
27:55 selling a book or has something to gain
27:57 from saying that you know Hitler lived
28:00 there but they generally say that Hitler
28:02 died and the number I heard was 1964 and
28:05 then Ava Brown died at 1968 and so that
28:11 makes sense with his age and
28:13 what-have-you and then Angela Merkel
28:15 might have been his daughter now Angela
28:18 Merkel by all stretch looks like Adolf
28:22 Hitler she knows the story that they
28:25 give you since we're on the story of
28:27 Hitler is that she was a girl grew up in
28:29 East Germany but we've got photographs
28:32 of her as a child hanging out with the
28:36 [Music]
28:37 was a Chancellor as a Chancellor the May
28:41 the main girl the main woman who was
28:43 running England just before this latest
28:46 guy and some other woman who became a
28:49 very successful business entrepreneur
28:52 millionaire billionaire or whatever in
28:53 Europe so those photographs are in the
28:59 dozens but she was supposedly growing up
29:02 in East Germany
29:03 why I say East Germany because it's a
29:05 beautiful place to say someone grew up
29:08 by which there is no paperwork to prove
29:10 that this kid existed because East
29:13 Germany was literally a forgotten realm
29:15 of Russia right not a lot of paperwork
29:18 being done there and her age coincides I
29:23 think technically speaking I think she
29:24 was supposed to be born in 1954 okay so
29:27 you wait about ten years you have a kid
29:29 I mean we have to we have to consider
29:33 there might have been more than one kid
29:34 who knows but these two submarines are
29:39 rumored to have you know gone down
29:42 dropped off Hitler in the Antarctica
29:44 there are stories of him being cremated
29:47 and having his ashes stored in some
29:49 crazy base down there the only problem
29:53 with the story is with those two u-boats
29:55 is that they had to made all this
29:57 journey based on when they surrendered
29:59 when they said they were where they were
30:02 according to the conspiracy of it all
30:04 they would have been there in the heat
30:06 of winter when the ice shelf in the
30:10 Antarctica grows up to 1600 kilometers
30:14 away from the edge of the island or the
30:16 continent I should say and so it also
30:19 grows several meters thick and there's
30:20 no u-boats that can just you know raise
30:23 up and crash through the ice and because
30:26 you boats have to come up for air every
30:28 two days on average it couldn't have
30:31 done it I mean it would have been I mean
30:33 you know there could be a soft spot
30:35 somewhere but the technology way back in
30:38 the day to you know send a beam up and
30:40 find out how thick ices I'm unaware of
30:43 any you know technology that was rumored
30:47 to do that I'm not sure if it exists
30:50 today but you know are tried in
30:51 submarines are much more intense but ice
30:54 is an equalizer right it doesn't give a
30:56 [ __ ] what technology you have it's you
30:59 know sometimes I don't know if it's as
31:01 dense as steel it's not as dense as
31:03 still but boy I'll tear you apart right
31:04 remember the Titanic cream now one thing
31:08 I found out that was extremely
31:09 surprising with one of the conspiracies
31:11 that has definitely some facts to it was
31:16 that there was this
31:17 this battle down there between us and in
31:21 the Germans because there were I guess
31:23 three people who died in an accident on
31:26 the ice and a sailor that died in a ship
31:29 and so they tallied up those four deaths
31:31 and said that those were the results of
31:33 a big giant battle and I would say that
31:37 sounds like victory to me if there's a
31:40 naval battle and only four people pass
31:43 away but it's confirmed that three of
31:45 them passed away on the ice which I
31:47 guess could have been some again gun
31:49 battle or something but again if you
31:52 really study World War two in the
31:54 attrition of that war on the German
31:57 government and how much they were
32:00 conserving all resources in order to
32:03 continue the war so that they could have
32:05 a chance at winning the idea that
32:07 someone would you know let's just rewind
32:09 history and pretend like we're a fly on
32:11 the wall and there's this you know
32:12 meeting with Hitler and all of his
32:14 commanders and it's like could you
32:16 imagine him saying well how are we doing
32:17 with our base in Antarctica you know
32:20 what would be the point we gonna go down
32:23 there and live yeah it's about some nice
32:25 living isn't it you know negative 60
32:29 below oh is it 60 below zero there's a
32:31 winter temperature down there depending
32:34 on what elevation you're at and that's
32:36 why it's so much colder Gunners because
32:38 it is land that lifts you up into the
32:40 atmosphere thus cooling off the
32:42 temperatures the Arctic
32:44 you know melts completely away every few
32:47 years and then it freezes all the way
32:48 back because it's a cycle up there
32:50 because it's it's just sea level right
32:52 there's no continent up there now the
32:56 other thing is is that regardless of
32:59 what they've done and again we can we
33:01 can engage you cover up story to this
33:03 but there have been from all different
33:07 countries that have sophisticated you
33:10 know technology to do this but there's
33:12 still research researchers from
33:13 countries that don't have the technology
33:14 to get on these expeditions and they go
33:16 down there the region that they
33:18 supposedly commandeered which was again
33:22 a very accessible region which is why
33:24 Norway had already settled it has been
33:26 utterly overrun by tens of thousands of
33:29 scientists in the last
33:30 years so if there's some secret base
33:34 then that exact region which is very
33:37 populated today in terms of its this is
33:40 where you get offices where you go this
33:41 place is where you go you know base one
33:43 sort of thing how could they hide it and
33:47 let me give you a better analogy so that
33:49 your brain can can digest this it would
33:52 be tantamount to someone saying there's
33:57 something called was it Cape Cod
33:59 it's the handle of Massachusetts the
34:03 state in America that's on the coast on
34:06 the East Coast in the New England area
34:07 let's say someone said that the Nazis
34:10 created this secret base they're like we
34:12 weren't here or something and now
34:14 America's here and now it's like okay
34:16 well I got cousin lives there and uncle
34:18 lives there and somebody someone always
34:19 goes there to vacation it's like if
34:22 there was a big military base there be
34:25 concrete structure and there's a
34:26 cover-up going on right
34:28 the US government hides it or whatever
34:30 then it you wouldn't have all that
34:32 population allowed there you go to some
34:34 other location but if you really look up
34:37 the area where they were on a map and
34:39 you look at the way it's populated today
34:41 it's one of the most accessible places
34:43 on the whole continent so I'm you know
34:47 if it existed then they destroyed it or
34:50 we destroyed it but I honestly believe
34:53 because we haven't as the I guess first
34:58 world countries after World War two we
35:01 haven't created a giant base down there
35:02 that that Mears the Indiana Jones kind
35:07 of stuff I think there was that's the
35:08 hidden base was in the Antarctic I think
35:10 in one of those movies I could be wrong
35:12 but somebody did something like that you
35:16 know laying foundation and pouring tons
35:17 of cement sand you know how something
35:19 gonna dry in this really cold weather
35:21 maybe grace great maybe it doesn't hell
35:23 I don't know but it would be a huge
35:25 effort and everywhere there's a pill box
35:28 in Europe or a big bunker on Omaha Beach
35:32 and stuff all that stuff still there cuz
35:35 it's really hard to get rid of and it's
35:37 very expensive to get rid of it and so
35:39 you're kind of like gonna [ __ ] it just
35:40 leave it there and we'll call it a
35:41 historical site
35:43 important that we tell the history
35:44 anyway so there it is right but I'm
35:47 gonna hop around now because the the
35:49 conspiracies start to fly around and
35:52 again there's some sort of interesting
35:55 truths that apply to this and then you
36:00 know we can easily take it somewhere
36:01 else so you know again it's not a crime
36:07 to hear a conspiracy and be entertained
36:09 and dive into it and hit just really
36:12 you're researching a LARP in a lot of
36:15 cases and so you know one of the things
36:18 that is really rumored about Hitler is
36:23 that he was into the supernatural he was
36:25 into this alternate you know paranormal
36:28 world and so you know the real truth of
36:31 the matter is is that his father's
36:33 mother was a maid at a Rothschild
36:35 mansion unwed gets pregnant she's
36:38 released from duty she's flown to
36:41 Austria to have this re driven to
36:43 Austria to have this kid which is his
36:45 father and then you know wall when
36:48 Hitler turns 18 years old he goes away
36:50 for two years and comes up with mine
36:53 Kampf and comes up with all kinds of you
36:55 know I'm gonna be at certain places
36:57 certain times and things are gonna
36:58 happen for me so there's there's
37:00 evidence that he's sort of a bastard
37:03 child of the Rothschild in just family
37:06 excuse me but so remote on the family
37:09 list that he's not going to get that
37:10 kind of you know you're a full-blooded
37:13 Rothschild sort of treatment yeah
37:16 because you know rotschild even there
37:19 was a Chicano Z Jews which means they're
37:23 converted Jews not genetic Jews I don't
37:25 mean offend anyone because they've now
37:27 cross their blood stream so much that
37:29 I'm sure that you have Jewish blood in
37:31 them at some point but he had to hide
37:34 the fact that he had this grandmother
37:36 that had a child with a Jew and so his
37:41 father was potentially half Jewish and
37:44 he had to burn down the hospital year
37:47 but all those records and the only guy
37:49 to do that so Brock Obama you know this
37:52 is being recorded the time that the DHS
37:54 whistle blower on Obama just was
37:58 it's just funny how that [ __ ] just gets
38:00 reported I was like oh that's just too
38:02 bad like really just too bad they just
38:04 kill the guy that could could absolutely
38:07 expose Obama for what he was you know
38:09 crazy man but one of the interesting
38:15 things I found out that they talked
38:16 about this battle was that the story
38:19 goes is that the base was never
38:21 destroyed and the Nazis not only created
38:25 the base but we're able to be this
38:27 really like you know Grand Central
38:30 Station area of the Antarctica with all
38:33 these other researchers passing by for
38:35 decades and they're completely hidden
38:37 away and you know there's there's
38:40 mountain ranges that you know people
38:42 like all those pyramids down there and
38:44 it's like really you know haven't you
38:47 ever taken soil and dropped it and
38:49 dropped it and dropped it until it made
38:50 a pyramid shape well that's a kind way
38:52 Organic Mountains do their thing man
38:55 it's just it's not so you know some
38:58 folks feel like they need to go there
39:00 but the the absurd story of my opinion
39:03 was that within 15 or 17 years from 1945
39:06 1958 there's this big battle royale and
39:10 atomic bombs were dropped down there
39:12 three atomic bombs and what I didn't
39:17 know was that the Americans did detonate
39:24 three atomic bombs down there I mean
39:27 that's I don't know it's kind of crazy
39:29 you know if you try to travel down there
39:31 today you can't get any of your permits
39:33 to travel down there which is a big
39:36 catalyst for Flat Earth believers
39:38 because they want what you defecate they
39:41 won't let you walk
39:43 you can't touch a plant you can't touch
39:45 an animal like they'd make it impossible
39:46 for you to get your permit to travel
39:48 there but America detonates three atomic
39:52 bombs and supposedly you know like some
39:56 of them fairly deep like 200 kilometers
39:58 in inland the second bomb was was blown
40:01 up I couldn't figure out which what the
40:04 Megaton reading was
40:06 but it's just crazy I I watched a video
40:09 that basically showed a huge explosion
40:12 it seemed very icy and white and I don't
40:16 know if they're trying to say that that
40:17 was the filming of the 1958 explosion
40:20 but so 1958 all these bombs are dropped
40:22 down there and again this is where they
40:25 claimed there's a huge battle with the
40:27 with the Nazis and the idea would be
40:31 that means the Nazis were you know one
40:34 hundreds of miles inland to build their
40:37 base which again just ask anyone who's
40:39 been there go study just general
40:44 researchers and the area all the way up
40:46 until like the 70s and 80s people are
40:48 dying they're like Mount Everest it was
40:50 crazy
40:50 but the other one is that the the Nazis
40:55 met aliens who were living in the South
40:58 Pole okay well you know there is a
41:01 treaty that was signed by every country
41:05 that was anybody in the 50s said no
41:07 one's allowed down there unless you get
41:09 permission so you know once an area is
41:13 is coveted and held in secret well
41:17 that's gonna fuel rumors rumors and
41:22 theories now the the big question and
41:26 there's that that incredible I forget
41:28 the freaking name of the series but
41:30 there's this incredible movie series
41:33 which I believe Netflix has these
41:34 Russian kids had created this funny a
41:37 story where the where the Nazis actually
41:39 escaped earth and went to the moon and
41:42 set up the base there and they were
41:44 missing like a power supply to get back
41:46 to earth because their ship crash or
41:49 whatever eventually they'd steal a power
41:52 source and they come back to invade
41:54 Earth it's I think it's up to three
41:55 movies now and if you know the budget
41:58 these kids are working with and their
41:59 backstory it is it is great
42:03 entertainment as dinosaurs in it and
42:05 it's just hilarious man now the the
42:10 story of an alien working with the Nazis
42:14 it's just
42:16 it's easy fodder for the unknown you
42:20 know if you know for whatever reason I
42:24 took my house and I painted all the
42:25 windows black or white or put tin foil
42:28 on them or whatever so no one could ever
42:29 see it and I refuse to let anyone come
42:32 in the house and it becomes a big
42:33 national story you know people could
42:37 start all kinds of rumors he's got
42:40 aliens in there he's got reptiles in
42:42 there whatever and what defense do you
42:45 have besides to let someone in your area
42:46 to prove that it's not occurring right
42:49 for people that want you to fear them
42:51 more than love them which in a time of
42:54 war is definitely a mental piece of
42:57 propaganda technique that is very
42:59 valuable right you know I used to think
43:02 the Roswell thing did not occur and that
43:04 it was used as a sign up against other
43:07 countries to suggest that we had UFO
43:09 materials now I still don't know what we
43:13 would have discovered out of those ships
43:15 besides the theory of you know the
43:18 spaceship itself and again if you just
43:22 go and listen to my to Roswell episodes
43:24 I went in not believing anything about
43:28 that stuff and when I just quarantine my
43:30 research to the the the witnesses of the
43:35 materials being brought to various
43:36 locations and looked at by experts
43:38 remember Roswell base was a weather
43:41 balloon covert secret base and so the
43:44 people that saw the materials that came
43:45 off of this crash site are looking at
43:48 these materials going well we build
43:50 everything at Roswell
43:51 so this cover story that it's a weather
43:54 balloon it's and all the materials were
43:56 you know made from toy tape and balsa
44:00 wood and plastics and all that crap one
44:02 of the guys that was in on it was
44:04 interviewed who saw all the material
44:06 held him with his hands two days in a
44:08 row because he did you have to see it
44:09 the night before and the morning the day
44:11 after he talked all about it and he goes
44:15 this is nothing that we made he goes
44:17 he's the dude that actually crushed the
44:18 foil and said it came back to the same
44:20 shape he's a guy shot a bullet through
44:21 it and couldn't put a hole in this paper
44:24 thin steel this guy's not selling
44:28 t-shirts he's not selling a book
44:30 and he was probably within five years of
44:32 his death when he did the interview
44:33 because he was so freaking old but you
44:35 just do all the interviews from the
44:37 husbands and wives and the friends of
44:38 people that were murdered and with these
44:40 old ladies are just you know terrified
44:42 of the camera like am I gonna get killed
44:44 if I tell you this sort of thing it's
44:46 not Hollywood men you see for telling
44:48 you what they believe to be the truth at
44:50 least straight but now with fighters
44:53 you've got this theory that the aliens
44:55 are just on the other side of the wall
44:57 you can get real romantic with that
44:59 story too but now the question is is if
45:03 they made a friendship with aliens you
45:07 know I don't think Hitler would have
45:11 ended up in Argentina I don't think that
45:13 the Germans may have lost the war it
45:15 just depends on your theory of what
45:17 aliens would do with a hostile nation
45:19 that is a war with the rest of the world
45:21 - Japan and the u.s. you know battling
45:24 it out in the Pacific and you know and
45:28 could you imagine you know trying to
45:30 assess a situation you're an alien race
45:33 that either is already here and you're
45:36 being you know your doors being knocked
45:38 on you know who is it oh it's the humans
45:40 out here or you land and you're watching
45:44 this world war occur now unless these
45:46 are sadistic bastards that participate
45:49 in war or love to create [ __ ] you
45:52 know you know storms for us to fight and
45:55 that kind of stuff which seems it seems
45:58 contradictory doesn't it that an alien
45:59 would be a warbound race you know
46:03 there's this whole thing of they're
46:06 always invading a planet turning us into
46:08 slaves we mine precious minerals
46:11 negating the fact that fusion can make
46:13 anything in the anything in the universe
46:16 that can be created on the element
46:17 stable plus a few other things that we
46:18 don't we haven't figured out how to make
46:21 maybe a element 115 you don't need to
46:25 you can just take Stardust and make gold
46:27 if that's what you need there's just no
46:29 need for us to mine it out of the ground
46:31 at this huge expenditure and crossbreed
46:34 our genes together to make as slaves
46:36 it's just just all that's just fiction
46:39 it's just fun stuff have fun with it
46:42 would yell at your neighbor your wife if
46:45 they don't believe you
46:46 you know don't lose a friendship over it
46:48 now there's all these fake photoshopped
46:51 pictures two of you know Hitler with an
46:54 alien and then you'll see the original
46:56 photograph and there's no alien in the
46:57 photograph and then someone will come
46:59 around and say we'll see they took the
47:00 alien out first and say okay you can't
47:03 win the argument and trying to prove
47:06 that the stuff didn't exist because none
47:08 of us were there but I think that
47:11 logically speaking you know would be I
47:15 don't know I I would just in my
47:19 estimation of something that is just
47:21 completely fictitious which is us having
47:23 made this huge relationship with an
47:27 alien race I don't think that they would
47:29 participate in a war nor enable someone
47:32 to to win a war if the atomic bomb is
47:37 any sign of our capabilities you know in
47:40 Star Trek the whole idea that we have to
47:42 hit warp in order to be visited by one
47:46 of the folks which first was the Balkans
47:49 you know that it makes sense I mean Gene
47:52 Roddenberry was brilliant with that
47:53 which is to say warp is the reason why I
47:56 don't know if that was actually
47:57 something he came up with or not but
48:00 could have been one of his writers but
48:02 the idea that now you're traveling the
48:04 universe you're gonna get in our
48:05 backyard and because you're gonna in our
48:07 backyard you need to be introduced to
48:08 the rest of the population of the galaxy
48:10 that makes sense but you know we look
48:14 for aliens in space because we are
48:16 looking for you know radio transmissions
48:20 and right now as of was it February late
48:23 February 2020 we have a broadcast that's
48:28 happening every 16 days and they're
48:29 trying to figure out what it is
48:31 interesting Tesla when he was in
48:33 Springfield Colorado immediately when he
48:36 was building an antenna was finding this
48:39 is like in 1916 okay he was getting a
48:44 transmission from space that seemed very
48:45 intelligent and of course they made fun
48:47 of them and try to get rid of it
48:49 so maybe it's a pretty good basis for a
48:51 nice story isn't it but one of these
48:54 stories okay
48:56 and I'm not even making this up is the
48:59 Cthulhu something that HP Lovecraft
49:03 created out of thin air which is the
49:08 Cthulhu is explain this a couple times
49:10 but the best analogy I could give you
49:12 would be that black ball in the movie
49:15 Fifth Element that's coming to just
49:17 erase everything or it is the nothing in
49:19 the neverending story
49:20 it is interested in destroying all
49:23 things meaning nothing is there after it
49:26 does what it does which negates its own
49:29 existence or the whole the whole being
49:31 is this almost like mental paradox but
49:36 that this being lives underneath the ice
49:38 right now the funny thing about that
49:40 story is that people who are idiots
49:42 don't understand that the Antarctica is
49:45 a land based structure I'll give a [ __ ]
49:48 what you believe about an ice barrier
49:49 and all that kind of stuff go in a few
49:51 miles and dig down you're gonna hit rock
49:53 if you go in a few more miles you're
49:55 gonna start seeing mountains so the idea
49:58 that it's underneath the ice which
49:59 wouldn't mean underneath the continent
50:01 it is hilarious I guess it's on the edge
50:03 somewhere right but that a kethu lives
50:06 there he lives under the ice and the
50:08 Hitler being this big supernatural freak
50:11 I'm guess he found a treasure map or had
50:13 it heard a rumor and through Interpol
50:16 and went down there and found him and
50:18 did a deal with him it's like please he
50:23 would have won the war a nurse would
50:24 have disappeared right you know
50:27 according to Lovecraft it's uh I believe
50:29 that's the duty came up with a story our
50:32 souls wouldn't exist I mean it would
50:34 just be the the Faust the story of Faust
50:39 times a hundred you know times a million
50:41 times infinity okay but let's go to what
50:47 the Nazis were actually developing
50:49 around the time of 1944-45
50:51 and what we found in their schematics
50:56 right before Operation Paperclip smuggle
50:58 them all over to the United States at
51:00 least as I've always heard a describe to
51:03 us and I think we can I think history is
51:06 actually revealed
51:09 that they always said that the Russians
51:11 and the Americans in Berlin split these
51:14 folks up and said okay if you're really
51:17 really brilliant you're gonna get a
51:18 clean expunged past meaning all your
51:22 Nazi war crimes are gonna be removed
51:24 from history you're gonna get in some
51:26 cases a brand new identity and then the
51:29 Dulles brothers you know smuggle them
51:32 over to United States and they get split
51:33 up and a bunch of went to do the mind
51:35 control program in Kay ultra and the
51:38 other ones went off and created NASA
51:40 which is where you get Verner von braun
51:42 engineer of the engineering designer of
51:44 the v1 and v2 rocket systems right the I
51:49 think the I'm gonna butcher the
51:51 pronunciation of this but this UFO
51:55 aircraft this flying saucer aircraft
51:58 that the Nazis are working on I think it
52:00 was called the degli
52:01 egg Locker or the Bell and it's very
52:05 much like the old Hindu drawings of a
52:09 gravity antigravity ship which then
52:13 feeds into a lot of Bob Lazar designs
52:15 for his sports model like the one that
52:17 lands in the backyard now Bob Lazar
52:20 definitely updated to look a little bit
52:22 more sort of like vector car design or
52:26 Lamborghini car design of the 70s and
52:28 80s you know it was very smooth and
52:30 refined whereas the bell that the
52:33 Germans had had drawn on paper was
52:35 almost identical with a little bit of
52:38 refinement from the Hindu illustrations
52:41 that were like you know around this time
52:43 of the story of Christ's reign we also
52:47 know that the German is working on a
52:49 flying wing the that had the intent to
52:54 be a stealth bomber a stealth aircraft
52:57 which of course which now of course the
53:00 US military have perfected that whole
53:03 concept right but the flying wing was
53:05 something that the Pontiac logo was
53:07 based on because it was an aircraft that
53:09 we conceived of you know back in the
53:13 turn of the century my hometown is named
53:16 after a pilot named Octavio Knute octave
53:19 Chanute was a guy that was like an OG
53:21 aviator
53:24 who came up with all kinds of wild
53:27 patents and one of his big patents was
53:29 to shape the fuselage like a wing which
53:33 albeit wasn't the the flying wing
53:36 concept but imagine you know you we get
53:39 in these tubes right and tubes are very
53:42 structurally amazing right the arch is
53:45 something that's phenomenal in terms of
53:47 its strength which is why we have to
53:48 base planes but imagine the brilliance
53:51 of taking the entire fuselage of a jet
53:54 and shaping it like a wing and so the
53:57 whole body of the plane including the
53:59 wings are creating lift now the other
54:02 thing octave Chanute figured out was the
54:05 the vertical are there horizontal
54:07 stabilizers in the nose cone and so
54:09 you'll see various fighter jets abused
54:12 that I think the was that the Russian
54:15 version of the concorde looking plane
54:17 had been and it's very versatile i mean
54:20 if you take the pilot out of an aircraft
54:22 you can put that wing on the front and
54:25 you can do you know 180 turns at you
54:30 know g-forces that a pilot would be
54:33 killed so those you know there's just
54:36 been brilliant stuff all over the world
54:38 and when we found it in the Nazi realm
54:42 you know that I think the thing that the
54:45 thing that really blows the mind of most
54:46 people and this is the way I would have
54:50 written the conspiracy as a complete
54:53 fictional thing to drop on society as
54:55 this truthful thing right if I was going
54:57 to be that devious I would have found a
55:00 more opportune time maybe a decade or
55:02 two before the war and we've a
55:09 conspiracy but he still doesn't pan out
55:11 in the end but we would conspiracy were
55:13 the Russian or sorry the Germans would
55:16 have found all this alien technology way
55:18 before they wanted to conduct a war and
55:21 I mean gee if you want to make a movie
55:23 out of it you have Hitler going down and
55:26 talking to these folks wherever he finds
55:28 them he makes his case that the world
55:30 has been against Germany that they're
55:32 really good people he illustrates his
55:35 case of who
55:36 who are the bad guys and who are the
55:38 good guys Chris is gonna blame bankers
55:40 Jewish bankers and he's like I just need
55:44 to get rid of all these people in the
55:45 world will be a euphoric place and we're
55:47 gonna reduce the race down as some Aryan
55:49 blend and and I just need your help and
55:53 so they're like okay well here's how you
55:54 make the best planes the best tanks
55:57 here's how you make a submarine ears
55:58 make all this other stuff but then if
56:00 you were to invest as an alien into
56:02 Hitler then he starts losing you gotta
56:06 let the boy hang you mean you let him
56:08 lose probably not you're gonna keep okay
56:11 with a here's a make laser beams here's
56:13 how you make stealth technology not that
56:15 crappy [ __ ] but like like Klingon
56:19 stealth or your [ __ ] just disappears
56:21 right now let me just put some other
56:25 deltas in your brain for how brilliant
56:28 everyone was in that era okay for
56:33 instance obviously we start the war and
56:36 I'm gonna give you a little interesting
56:39 story here that I just recently saw
56:41 which will sort of it's just an
56:44 interesting story that sort of reflects
56:46 what was going on in the time and how
56:48 much we evolved as a result of World War
56:50 two now obviously for those of you who
56:55 are buffs I got a buddy Dave who is just
56:57 an absolute war historian of all wars
57:00 but definitely knows 1 & 2 as at a level
57:04 that I've never met anyone and I was in
57:06 EA where we had the Jane series which
57:09 was all war or war based games based on
57:13 what was actually available at the time
57:15 but you know all of these countries we
57:18 started off with very few in 1941 we
57:21 started off with very few airports in
57:24 the whole world and so one of the big
57:27 commodities coming out of Britain and
57:29 the name of the company escapes me but
57:31 they had mastered you know boat planes
57:36 planes that land on the water
57:38 big giant things like almost like small
57:41 cruise ships with wings and this company
57:45 that was really famous for creating
57:46 these big giant flying boats
57:50 they hibernated during the war and
57:53 continue designing this titanic shaped
57:57 boat man I mean it was it was a massive
57:59 massive boat with the intent that as
58:03 soon as the war is over it's all going
58:05 to be you know the Boomer age and it's
58:07 gonna be great and everyone's gonna want
58:08 to travel and so in their minds the
58:11 flying boat was way more versatile
58:14 because there's always a body of water
58:15 somewhere there's a lake there's an
58:17 ocean so not a big problem right and so
58:21 but unbeknownst to them because of the
58:24 war plane technology went through the
58:29 roof and because of war every country
58:32 realized we need air bases everywhere
58:34 because we need to be able to pick up
58:36 and move to another place and ship stuff
58:37 around and remember the well you may not
58:40 know this but the old email of the of
58:43 that era was people would write
58:45 telegrams on paper it all get on a
58:49 periodic basis I'll get bundled up put
58:51 on a on a plane a very quick one and
58:55 flown to the other base and then it
58:57 would be dropped off in secret taken to
58:59 a warehouse people on roller skates
59:01 would roller skate around with these
59:03 cards and go to the cubicles where
59:05 people would actually sort them all and
59:10 sometimes they'd make a phone call gives
59:12 a piece of information sometimes it'd be
59:14 handed off to someone else that goes to
59:15 a secretary and actually it may have
59:18 been in Reverse excuse me I may have
59:19 been in the cubicles and then it's taped
59:21 up on the wall and someone escaped by
59:22 and grab it and delivered anyway that
59:24 was the old email back in the day so by
59:26 the time the end of the war came around
59:30 this flying boat company couldn't sell
59:33 their products because the pitch that's
59:36 like hey there's barely any airports in
59:38 the world we're going to land everywhere
59:39 you got a lake or whatever you just
59:41 build your your kind of port base there
59:44 your port set of airport it would be
59:45 like a water port and people just travel
59:48 though
59:50 well he ended up going out of business
59:53 by the early 50s but before they went
59:56 out of business they designed this
59:57 gigantic gigantic thing because they
60:01 were also using prop planes prop engines
60:03 excuse me and they'd have like eight
60:05 prop engines on these things would like
60:07 to double propellers and they were
60:12 obviously scolded by you know the
60:14 Aeronautics industry going why would we
60:16 use that we have gin engines now so by
60:18 the early 50s they didn't build this but
60:20 they design one with I think 28 jet
60:23 engines in it in this gigantic me if you
60:25 ever see the design of this thing it is
60:28 breathtaking men just look up
60:31 documentaries about flying boats on
60:33 YouTube and you'll probably bump into
60:34 this it's probably bout 30 minutes long
60:36 and it turns out the Russians in the 60s
60:39 had created the same thing and they were
60:41 gonna make these bomber planes that
60:43 we're gonna fly over water but they ran
60:46 into all the problems that this other
60:47 company ran into which is that
60:49 especially if you land on the ocean salt
60:53 water eats up all of the mechanics and
60:56 so that became a big issue plus they
60:59 couldn't get this thing off the ground
61:00 far enough to safely fly over the ocean
61:03 waves and could you imagine some of
61:05 those ocean waves were they're 100
61:06 stories high sometimes in a really bad
61:08 storm it would be a most horrific death
61:11 wouldn't it but you know let's take it I
61:14 think it was called the was mp40 was
61:18 their machine gun the really long thin
61:20 tube one with the big giant mag on it
61:21 it's just this amazing machine gun it
61:24 never jammed and you know it was like
61:27 the thing that if a US soldier were to
61:29 kill a German a lot of them would pick
61:32 that gun up and sling it over their
61:33 shoulder so when their tommy gun ran out
61:35 they would or their m4 whatever they
61:39 would just start using that you know the
61:40 German gun but around the same time you
61:42 have the tommy gun rights the tommy gun
61:44 goes through two iterations one was sort
61:49 of the drum loaded tommy gun which which
61:52 was very easy to load if you were in a
61:54 nice quiet place right but the problem
61:58 is is that if you open them the Tommy
62:00 gun barrel open it up the little
62:02 canister thing and you just have to drop
62:03 bullets in it was the most amazing
62:05 loading mechanism ever very simple but
62:07 if you're in a foxhole with a bunch of
62:09 you know our Tillery coming in and dirt
62:12 flying everywhere as long as a dirt clod
62:14 got in your your barrel your little they
62:18 call it drum you couldn't it wouldn't
62:21 work anymore and so they gave it to a
62:23 Marine who evaluated the gun and was
62:26 like okay this is great but one it's a
62:29 little too powerful because it's it's
62:31 kicking up a little bit too much and I
62:33 get where this drum thing because this
62:35 just won't work combat and so they ended
62:36 up creating I believe was a 1928 version
62:40 of it which had the straight mag on it
62:42 shooting 45s 45s were not intentionally
62:46 chosen but because this the rock the pin
62:50 technology inside the tommy gun actually
62:53 came off of a naval gun the the the real
62:56 pin mechanism was this gigantic piece of
63:00 steel that used the impact and the heat
63:04 of the cartridge to - it actually would
63:08 fire the bullet and it would heat up the
63:10 pin so much that it chemically would
63:12 weld for a few split seconds - the piece
63:15 of steel behind a holding it back so the
63:17 other round would fall in and then it
63:18 loses the chemical bond and pops the
63:21 bullet in place and get the next bullet
63:22 so these 45 specifically because they
63:25 were small rounds that work with his pin
63:27 technology was utterly brilliant now we
63:31 all are also familiar with the 1947 you
63:34 know the version of cough aka ak-47
63:37 which is also this massive weapon that
63:40 was it's still a big problem today
63:41 because it's so amazing you know you
63:43 talk about those they're found in
63:46 Vietnam buried in the dirt and you can
63:48 just pick him up brush him off and fire
63:50 him I mean there's just utterly
63:51 phenomenal machines people don't know
63:54 that the 45 automatic was made in 1905
63:58 amazing big ass gun because the soldiers
64:02 that they were fighting I can't remember
64:04 the war that they were talking about but
64:06 one of our enemies was taking so many
64:08 they would take a lot of drugs a lot of
64:10 stimulants before they went into war
64:13 went into battle because there was a
64:14 high chance they would die and so you
64:16 would shoot them with other Cal
64:17 and they just keep coming at you and so
64:20 the 45 was commissioned to basically
64:23 disable the body to kill it so badly
64:27 with one or two shots that this soldier
64:29 he come in any further and it's 1:45 to
64:32 the chest is like a soma dropping a
64:35 sledgehammer from six feet right onto
64:38 your chest if you're lying on the ground
64:39 and that's a hell of a pop you know but
64:43 what's interesting is this archetype
64:44 with the Nazis okay I've said this
64:48 several times different areas and the
64:51 the most classic one is in Egypt any
64:56 time man gets their [ __ ] together and
64:59 gets really really smart and masters
65:03 technology that is then lost it depends
65:07 on who's telling a story and who blew
65:09 away everyone as to how the the story
65:12 goes but you know the the pyramids in
65:14 Giza just outside of Cairo there they
65:20 are you know always been associated with
65:22 alien technology aliens built them there
65:24 alien runways alien alien alien I'll
65:28 tell you that I think it's because white
65:29 people told the story and they want to
65:32 sort of cut the balls off anyone else's
65:33 capabilities the Greeks want to say they
65:36 invented all the mathematics of the
65:37 world because they're guys named
65:38 everything but by the time you go to
65:40 Egypt you realize it's again if you're a
65:43 grandma Hancock disciple you'll know
65:46 that they go back potentially thirty
65:48 five thousand years before those
65:50 pyramids were built but they can't let
65:53 man have that alkali that you can't
65:55 believe that there was a utopian society
65:57 in Egypt that just didn't have war you
66:01 know it doesn't mean everyone got along
66:02 doesn't mean there weren't you know
66:03 slaves here and there but it depends you
66:07 know if it's really interesting the I'm
66:11 just gonna have a small footnote on
66:12 slavery in those times if you liked
66:17 working for someone you like someone
66:19 else making the decisions because you
66:22 found it more peaceful in your mind to
66:24 just execute a job I mean what are we
66:26 when we go work for the man right you're
66:30 ten
66:31 the slaves except you did a little bit
66:32 of payment for your troubles
66:34 it's basically what is calorie energy
66:37 converted to monetary units that they
66:38 could be spent at your leisure and
66:39 you're choosing so you know the theories
66:44 that the pyramids will buy slaves is I
66:46 think grossly exaggerated but then it
66:48 makes that society barbaric you know the
66:51 evidence that the the Aztecs and the
66:58 Mayans and what-have-you and Incas
67:02 excuse me
67:02 but they put all those pyramids those
67:04 amazing step pyramids in South America
67:07 what is the story on them well they
67:09 sacrifice children they found pits of
67:11 children's skulls there is obviously
67:14 obviously European paint on a stone down
67:20 there showing you know a guy holding a
67:22 baby and and blood droplets coming off
67:24 of them and you know what's entirely
67:28 insulting about that is one that that
67:30 paintings gonna last
67:31 externally because it's an external
67:32 painting the wives there's several of
67:35 them that I've seen but you have a
67:38 culture that is capable of rendering
67:39 anything you know it's just like the
67:42 Egyptians right the Egyptians are
67:43 capable of rendering anything in terms
67:46 of making a statue painting a painting
67:48 of what it looks like and so to have
67:51 like a finger paint
67:52 you know symbol and this some [ __ ]
67:55 coming around going no we got proof it's
67:58 essentially it's like a really subvert
67:59 addresses 'm it's really strange right
68:02 so germans are great engineers it's in
68:06 your blood
68:06 I mean I'm 3/4 German and the fourth
68:10 that I don't know about we're not quite
68:12 sure but it doesn't look like where the
68:15 family actually migrated from so many
68:17 there's a big bunch of my friends from
68:20 Norway think we're no region from that
68:21 side of the family but anyway so it's in
68:24 your blood you just you have to know how
68:26 everything works and you can figure out
68:27 everything if you put your mind to it
68:29 and so if I create something great and
68:31 you don't understand it then okay
68:33 there's a conspiracy theory I'm an alien
68:34 in my backyard and I was given all the
68:36 technology because it couldn't happen
68:37 for me great this is typically how it
68:40 goes all of the stuff I've talked about
68:42 where
68:43 they say the Roswell crash gave us
68:45 integrated circuits gave us fiber optics
68:48 and velcro okay
68:50 you know velcro's and natural occurrence
68:53 in feathers it's a natural occurrence in
68:55 flowers pollination technology where
68:59 animals are bumping flowers and carrying
69:01 these things to other flowers and on
69:03 their set on their you know there's
69:04 their fur or whatever in terms of you
69:09 know fiber optics we've been extruding
69:11 every material in the world through
69:12 holes and so we knew in the Egyptian era
69:15 that if you put a a flame next to glass
69:17 that that light beam goes completely
69:19 across the glass okay so you extrude it
69:23 through a hole and there you have a
69:24 piece of a piece of glass that's going
69:29 to carry the light and then you start
69:30 using other materials that are more
69:31 flexible that have last like properties
69:33 it's just a natural progression of
69:36 technology integrated circuits well we
69:39 once we really started getting into
69:41 chemistry which is my god how far back
69:43 does alchemy go things exposed to light
69:46 naturally burned away and someone went
69:48 oh [ __ ] where did it all go all the
69:49 sunlight hit oh [ __ ] that was sunlight
69:51 burns stuff yeah okay well let's try to
69:54 see what we can do with this and so
69:56 silicon is a conductive material you can
69:59 layer it and insulate it and layer it
70:01 insulate it burning it with light the
70:02 whole way and you make some transistors
70:05 and what-have-you all these conspiracies
70:10 it it really makes you negate your own
70:15 capability because if you constantly say
70:19 aliens have made everything the second
70:21 that man actually figures out anything
70:22 then you're getting you're negating your
70:25 own genetics potentially from being an
70:27 engineer for being the next person so
70:29 you want to just go up on a hill
70:31 somewhere you know salute aliens until
70:33 they drop by and give you some knowledge
70:34 you know now the sad fact is that
70:39 because a bunch of psychopaths run the
70:41 world almost every innovation is either
70:44 used to enslave us like Tesla's
70:47 technology being you know canceled too
70:55 everything going into a war machine
70:57 algorithm well you can do that okay can
71:00 I kill you with it okay great I'm gonna
71:02 define your thing and then I'm we're
71:04 just gonna go full military on this
71:05 right probably I'm gonna repeat myself a
71:09 little bit here with a little bit more
71:10 on the stick but one of the greatest
71:13 science fiction movies that really
71:15 illustrates this whole acidic loop that
71:19 we're in is the the Christopher Walken
71:21 Natalie Wood movie her last movie by the
71:24 way
71:24 brainstorm whether you invented the
71:27 technology where they could put a helmet
71:28 on your head
71:29 and record all of your senses all five
71:32 senses and then they could record on
71:35 this wild tape and then play it back and
71:37 you have these same experiences the
71:39 other person had including death and so
71:41 the the woman who played Nurse Ratched
71:44 and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is
71:46 Christopher Walken scientific partner in
71:48 the laboratory and they just mastered
71:50 this and what they didn't realize was
71:53 the financial well the Institute that
71:55 they were working for which I think was
71:57 a private Institute they didn't realize
72:00 it but they were being subsidized by the
72:01 government and there's this creepy old
72:04 vinyl guy that he's not really by now
72:06 but he's good
72:07 so the Edgar Winter hair he just plays
72:09 the greatest creepy dude
72:12 for the government but nurse ratchets
72:14 yelling at Walken saying you know don't
72:18 let them sell us to the government
72:19 because the second they get a hold of
72:20 our technology they will find a way to
72:22 weaponize it and so you're looking at
72:25 this technology again we're recording
72:26 the census like how the hell is that
72:28 going to turn into a weapon you're gonna
72:29 get your enemies to wear helmet if they
72:32 created you know in the movie they
72:34 created a bunch of MKULTRA kind of
72:36 recordings that were eventually watched
72:38 by walk and son who has ends up in the
72:41 hospital after playing it for just a few
72:43 minutes but it happened in the movie you
72:47 know it did get commandeered and just to
72:50 set the premise up for you in case you
72:51 haven't seen that movie the reason why
72:54 you need to see that movie one it's
72:55 early Christopher Walken which is just
72:57 always a diamond mind of amazing acting
73:01 and Natalie Wood uses one of the finest
73:03 actresses to ever live and she passed
73:06 away I think during the filming of this
73:09 right off the coast of where I'm sitting
73:12 in Catalina Island where we think her
73:15 husband pushed her off the boat probably
73:18 don't mean to kill her but she was drunk
73:20 and drowned and then of course he looks
73:24 to Chris Rock and says you know I didn't
73:25 mean to kill my wife I know man she was
73:27 drunk she was belligerent she hates your
73:30 guts and then this happens and so poor
73:33 walking man he he's had to hide the
73:35 secret of that death his whole life her
73:38 family is still not letting up on that
73:40 investigation by the way but the premise
73:43 of the movie is that it kind of gets hot
73:47 the government's moving in to take the
73:49 technology but they haven't quite done
73:51 it yet they don't really have the
73:52 catalyzing reason to to say this is why
73:55 we're taking it away from you but Nurse
73:58 Ratched
73:58 I forget what what her name is in the
74:00 movie but she is working on a circuit
74:03 board or something at night by herself
74:04 and we've seen her take a little heart
74:06 pill earlier in the in the movies to
74:10 establish she has that issue and she
74:14 needs to solder something she smokes
74:17 she's a chain smoker in the movie and so
74:19 she's reaching for I think her cigarette
74:20 or something like that and she happens
74:21 to burn her wrist on a hot soldering
74:24 iron and that kicks off a cardiac arrest
74:28 because of her weak heart and so she's
74:31 going for the box of her little tiny
74:33 pills and she spills him on the ground
74:35 and she's trying to get to them but the
74:38 heart attack is massive and in a
74:42 brilliant move I mean this is just the
74:44 premise of this movie let alone the
74:46 story they created around it which was
74:48 better than the premise and the premise
74:50 is an a-plus premise
74:52 she puts the headset on and hits record
74:55 and then dies and then the next day
75:00 Christopher Walken shows up with his one
75:03 of his kind of assistants and they're
75:06 they're trying to figure out what
75:07 happened her body's gone and he's like
75:11 okay this was the tape that was she
75:13 recorded just before she passed and
75:15 you're like yeah so it goes okay well
75:17 I'm gonna play it and you stand right
75:19 here and she puts this thing on
75:22 and turns it on and he meetly starts
75:24 having a heart attack and he you know
75:28 he's starting to freak out and his buddy
75:30 knocks the thing off his head and grabs
75:31 him and the Corsi rehabilitates because
75:34 he doesn't have weak heart and he's like
75:36 okay okay okay okay we need to
75:39 disconnect all the respiratory stuff off
75:42 the tape just just flatten that track
75:44 let me just have sight and sound and
75:47 maybe touch or some whatever you know
75:49 whatever's left and they start messing
75:52 with the Machine and they end up playing
75:55 this tape he only gets partially through
75:59 the tape before I think they're rated
76:01 and it's basically this amazing thing
76:09 that's on the tape because she recorded
76:11 the fact that she died so I'll let you
76:12 watch the movie but it's it's fantastic
76:15 I know it's a huge digression but you
76:19 know it's just like a little side dish
76:21 in a five-course familiar I guess for me
76:25 part of this whole thing is a phenomenon
76:28 this it's I don't know I guess it's like
76:33 if you know some people have skills to
76:37 do really weird things and I think that
76:40 we have enabled I guess fortunately
76:45 unfortunately who knows right it's it's
76:47 maybe there's no need to have a bias on
76:50 it or a judgment call on it but we have
76:52 people that are really really good at
76:55 stitching this stuff together stitching
76:57 together narratives I'm sure in the Army
76:59 Corps of psyops they have classes on how
77:01 to do this and how to put stuff together
77:03 which is why you know you know my friend
77:08 Vivian she tries to warn me about some
77:11 of these things she just be careful how
77:12 much you jump off on that kind of stuff
77:14 because unless you've really got the
77:16 concrete proof you gotta be careful
77:19 because you might be getting had and
77:20 then of course with any channel like
77:23 this credibility is a huge thing and me
77:26 as a human being credibility is just
77:28 everything it is like your word is bond
77:30 and you know lie and you don't make up
77:32 [ __ ] and and that tends to make life
77:36 really nice you know I could tell you
77:39 that any any okay so any celebrity
77:43 friend you might have in life they are
77:46 approached by thousands of kooky weird
77:48 [ __ ] I'm just telling you man
77:50 I've had to run interference for some my
77:52 rocker buddies and and I've seen it
77:56 firsthand
77:56 I've seen some just nutty [ __ ] and so
78:00 they if you are trying to get close to
78:02 them because you feel like you've got
78:04 something in common you know there's a
78:06 couple things you have to do and the
78:08 number one thing is to never tell lies
78:10 in embellish [ __ ] because they get that
78:13 all the time in there if they trust you
78:16 they are liable to repeat it now you can
78:18 lie all the time in your private world
78:20 and who's interviewing you nobody you're
78:23 never on a radio show you're not on some
78:24 live interview but if you pass some of
78:26 that information to someone who's
78:27 constantly in the in the limelight and
78:30 repeating stuff that's interesting to
78:32 them and they think you're telling them
78:33 the truth and then they come out and
78:35 look like a total douche who's just it
78:37 could destroy their career so they gotta
78:39 be very careful so the first element of
78:43 getting next to people that are very
78:45 creative and very powerful with their
78:46 talent pool is to have integrity the
78:49 second part of it is to don't is to mmm
78:53 you don't lie about weight loss are you
78:56 lie because I just covered that the big
79:00 one is to when you asked about your
79:02 opinion you have to be honest and you
79:06 have to if you're gonna criticize
79:08 something you're gonna have to have a
79:10 I'm elite I'm gonna criticize something
79:14 if I can see potentially a method to
79:17 make it better right
79:19 like you know I tell the story once
79:21 before and this relates to the
79:25 phenomenon of this Nazi story and us
79:27 believing in things is why I'm telling
79:29 you this because we need to kind of
79:31 improve the algorithm of our brains as
79:32 human beings in my opinion one of the
79:36 places I really learned this is a very
79:38 specific example was in my running
79:39 mentor is the person that changed my
79:42 life absolutely changed my life with the
79:45 stuff that he's made I saw it it changed
79:48 Joe was as a human being other people
79:50 pated and they also catalyzed the effect
79:52 of what this person did but i revere
79:55 this man you know he's if I were to say
79:59 who affected my life the most you know
80:02 he's in the top two or three okay you
80:06 might be tied for first a couple other
80:07 individuals but he was mentoring me on
80:11 how to write and he was working on a
80:14 script that he had written before he met
80:16 me and he gave it to me and he's like
80:18 well just tell what you think and I read
80:20 it and it's great great great great
80:22 great up to this point of the ending and
80:25 I can't even remember what the old and
80:27 it was but I remember her sitting in my
80:29 house and I wasn't I don't know how many
80:32 months I was with this guy at the time
80:34 maybe three or four months I'm now known
80:36 him for 13 years I guess twelve and a
80:40 half but um I sat there in my house I'm
80:43 thinking to myself [ __ ] I this I don't
80:45 like this at all this is a lame ending
80:48 and people were dying too soon people
80:51 didn't have any profound you know
80:54 meaning to the scripts meaning they died
80:56 without ever really contributing any
80:58 massive turn but they were huge
81:01 characters in the film it was very close
81:04 but it wasn't quite there and I remember
81:06 just you know he and I used to write
81:08 like books to each other every night at
81:11 the beginning and so I wrote this huge
81:12 you know probably page long thing about
81:15 like you know because of this because of
81:17 that I think this guy would have done
81:18 this or you would have had some effect
81:19 on this person because he's that way
81:21 what is I gave this whole I pitched it
81:23 to him basically to change it didn't
81:27 really offer it I didn't write rewrite
81:30 the ending myself and give it to him but
81:34 he got it and he's like and that we had
81:36 lunch very soon after that and he was
81:38 like so you don't like that and he goes
81:39 yeah I kind of see your point
81:40 so you went off over the next week and
81:43 rewrote a new ending utterly nailed it
81:47 nailed it
81:49 and so within a month I was going over
81:53 there three times a week it was like an
81:55 hour about an hour one way
81:58 and we're sitting there in his living
82:02 room and he said you know I really want
82:06 to thank you for pushing me on this
82:08 ending because I really love the new
82:10 ending and it really tied up a lot of
82:12 stuff that I felt but I just hadn't
82:15 really you know anyone pushed me on this
82:16 and he just said I want to really thank
82:18 you for doing that and Here I am
82:20 listening to someone who I revere
82:23 greatly and I was able to contribute
82:25 something to his game that I enjoy the
82:29 rewrite and he enjoyed the rewrite and
82:31 we went and pitched it all over
82:32 Hollywood so it was cool
82:33 so as we ingest all these conspiracies
82:41 you know what I think is really fun
82:45 because I used to think it was fun to go
82:47 into the room only if I thought I was
82:49 completely right about everything and
82:52 that I you know I have to say early in
82:54 the game probably night 2005 or so right
82:58 I was very quick to believe things
83:03 they're probably slower than other
83:04 people but for me the way I am today
83:07 because I know a lot of you folks and
83:09 listen to your comments and read them
83:10 what have you I realize I have to really
83:13 be careful and I like that now I like
83:16 that layer of like yeah you know well
83:19 I've heard the stories that uh so today
83:21 what I do is I say okay you know if it's
83:26 like this particular conspiracy and your
83:28 guys are gonna jump in with a bunch of
83:29 cool facts and I can't wait to hear your
83:31 take and what made you believe this is
83:33 true or not true or what-have-you but
83:36 it's now almost it's more euphoric for
83:42 me to get into a conversation about a
83:44 conspiracy where I'm not sure but all
83:48 I've done is gather a bunch of data and
83:50 so in the conversation I'll say well
83:54 yeah I've heard that you know and
83:55 there's this other thing too right and
83:57 then well then then if if I'm in the
83:59 conversation typically it's because
84:01 someone else brought it up you know very
84:04 rarely will I just jump in on somebody
84:06 and say hey I don't know if you like
84:07 conspiracies let's have a huge
84:08 conversation I only do that for the ones
84:11 I really believe
84:12 the drop on anyway you start having
84:15 these really rich conversations where
84:17 the other person is not defensive and
84:19 they're not accusatory and they're not
84:22 developing any heat in the conversation
84:24 because you're not telling them they're
84:26 wrong and you're not necessarily telling
84:27 that they're right you're being very
84:29 objective as they say right you're just
84:32 kind of presenting the facts so maybe
84:35 because the Internet is now you know a
84:38 healthy 25 years old definitely good 15
84:41 years into this type of content that's
84:44 you know we're talking about maybe it is
84:48 a an etiquette that we experiment with
84:52 or engage in fully or now we just sort
84:55 of you know for Bigfoot or something
84:57 like that you know you just can't like
84:59 well you know I'm still waiting for the
85:00 evidence you know Flat Earth I feel like
85:02 I'm the same way
85:03 I will talk to my friends about Flat
85:06 Earth and I'll represent flutters from
85:08 their perspective and and I'll say well
85:11 you know there is that thing and then
85:12 there's this and then you know part of
85:14 it because it becomes so jumbled up
85:16 where we have kind of evidence that it's
85:19 round evidence that it's not moving I
85:21 mean all these different things I'm
85:27 looking for the coup de Gras for a lot
85:29 of these things someone else who's never
85:30 heard of the theory before but maybe
85:32 they have some science in it they're um
85:34 they're able to just to say something
85:38 I'll give you an example it just
85:39 happened with my geologist friend I was
85:42 mentioning to her and showing her some
85:44 some visual evidence that I don't think
85:46 meteorites really happen especially the
85:50 surface of the Moon and if you're new to
85:51 that comment it's because every single
85:54 one of these things is perfectly round
85:55 just save any erosion that might have
85:58 happened over many years right and I
86:02 just said this what out you'll like this
86:03 because this little Paul Harvey to the
86:04 story the Diamondhead in Hawaii looks
86:08 just like the crater in Arizona off the
86:11 interstate 40 which is about I mean I
86:13 think they're similar to the same size
86:16 now Diamond Head is a lot more pitched
86:18 and younger has a lot less erosion and
86:20 still has like well it's at a tropical
86:22 environment so there's a lot of green on
86:23 it
86:24 but I've been to both and she was
86:30 telling me well you know that thing is
86:32 she believes it's a meteorite in Arizona
86:34 this is the first time anyone's ever
86:36 confronted her with this this other
86:38 theory and I said well you know I don't
86:42 buy it
86:42 I just don't buy the fact that
86:44 everything is perfectly you know all
86:46 these meteorites have to be coming
86:47 straight down which means they had no
86:49 for momentum in the atmosphere they
86:51 didn't fly through space they just came
86:53 you know wherever they came they came
86:55 directly at her that came directly at
86:56 the moon right so she told me this thing
86:59 she goes well you could find out whether
87:01 or not the crater in Arizona was a
87:04 volcanic eruption at some point in the
87:06 past because a volcano
87:10 even if dormant even if it will never
87:12 erupted ever again maybe the plate
87:14 underneath that created this this geyser
87:18 of magma has moved on all the structures
87:24 underneath are frozen in time meaning
87:27 the plates underneath will have the
87:30 volcanic you know I don't know cyclone
87:35 or her I should say like silo up to it
87:37 all frozen in time like The Devil's
87:39 Tower which is above ground right
87:41 because it's explaining earth but you
87:44 know no one's gonna go dig underneath
87:47 that thing to find it out you know why
87:49 would you one they have a tourist site
87:51 for a meteorite which makes money so
87:54 last thing they're gonna do is spend
87:56 money to prove it's not a meteorite
87:57 impact they're gonna need you go there
87:59 they they have all these paintings and
88:03 renderings of the impact you know and of
88:07 course you have the via MIDI will be
88:10 sort of crater shaped rings that are in
88:13 the north tip of South America where
88:17 they say the extinction event occurred
88:18 rate the amount of inference by theories
88:23 is just unbelievable and we just believe
88:27 it and it's you know it's again I'll
88:29 always reference the dinosaur tooth what
88:32 was it
88:34 1857 or something when this tooth was
88:37 found it's
88:37 just a tooth man six inch tooth that's
88:40 it now it's a big-ass tooth if it's
88:42 truly calcium based or enamel based
88:44 tooth and whatever the hell had that
88:47 tooth was definitely some big-ass
88:49 creature if it's truly a tooth three I
88:53 mean you know it's like okay so if your
88:55 walk down a beach you ever been in a
88:56 desert you ever been in some
88:59 mountainside where a bunch of rocks are
89:01 constantly dripping down the side and
89:03 you can find rocks that a shape of
89:06 arrowheads but they're not arrowheads
89:08 you know you can find one this shaped
89:10 like Bigfoot and it's not a statue at a
89:12 Bigfoot it's just it just happened to
89:14 tumble that way so if you're searching
89:16 and searching and searching and you
89:17 never know what you can find but anyway
89:18 they totally constructed basically a
89:21 small Tyrannosaurus Rex looking creature
89:24 around this tooth no bones were ever
89:28 found by this tooth ever and so to have
89:33 in 2010 and 20 or 30 20 20 what year a
89:36 Mayan Jesus this trainer horse Rex
89:39 exists it defies all physics it defies
89:42 all biology of but animal it doesn't
89:45 like physics doesn't hold the thing up
89:47 the way it's designed the constantly
89:49 make excuses for it's it's bad design
89:52 and but they publish it like a theory
89:54 that is true you know I can't make a
89:58 whole episode about this most likely I
90:01 thought boring the [ __ ] out of you
90:03 people so I'll give you a little five
90:04 minute dissertation on this theory
90:06 imagine imagine that you were able to
90:10 talk to some Oracle some angel some
90:13 alien God himself and I have these
90:18 things I call God facts which are the
90:21 facts that will never know without a God
90:24 to tell us the truth which is to say you
90:26 ask a question you get the answer the
90:29 absolute answer that's the truth and if
90:32 you were to ask God okay what percentage
90:34 of stuff that we believe on this planet
90:37 is true just the ratio even just a
90:41 hundred percent split in two pieces how
90:44 much do we believe that is completely
90:46 fake and how much do we believe that we
90:48 actually have true from history to sign
90:51 to the philosophy of the universe's
90:54 creation what you are God like how
90:57 messed up are we imagine the answer
91:01 imagine the answer I'm gonna say without
91:07 knowing my hunch at this point is that
91:11 we are well below 50% in terms of the
91:15 note we believe in fake gods we believe
91:21 fake history because the victors wrote
91:24 it to make people look like [ __ ] there's
91:26 all kinds of fake science fake pop
91:29 science you know NASA's and JPL is an
91:32 institution that is essentially a you
91:38 know it's funny I can draw an analogy
91:41 here the old fifty shows that were on
91:44 the radio that were science fiction
91:45 shows two thousand plus X minus one the
91:48 two you need to listen to X minus one
91:49 being the best one ever made
91:51 it was a publishing company that was
91:54 publishing small little booklets every
91:57 week of science fiction stories and
91:59 these writers live these tumultuous life
92:01 trying to compete for publishing right
92:03 they'd write a whole story and the
92:04 editor we go and it's not good enough
92:06 and then they wouldn't get any money so
92:09 it was atrocious but they pushed that
92:12 fiction into fictional radio shows and
92:14 made a bunch of money and entertain the
92:16 [ __ ] out of us write for me JPL and NASA
92:20 are the replacement it's no longer
92:24 fiction anymore they make it up and they
92:27 make it up in such a way that it's
92:29 science fiction denies science fantasy
92:31 which is sci-fi right Star Wars is
92:34 sci-fi now that [ __ ] needs to work Blade
92:38 Runner a science fiction spinner is
92:41 designed to really work you know all
92:43 this technology and that was made to
92:44 work and so now it it's a form of
92:51 entertainment in a way because if you
92:55 believe man does all these amazing
92:56 things then every time you look in the
92:58 mirror you're like well we're really
92:59 going somewhere mankind's going
93:01 somewhere and it's like
93:02 yeah maybe not maybe if you believe that
93:07 stuff you were catalyzing your own
93:09 demise you are delaying your children
93:12 from finding the truth that doesn't
93:15 really matter in in I as I get older I
93:17 swear to God I don't think it does that
93:20 well at least in the spiritual sense of
93:22 death and so let's just say you're a
93:25 total [ __ ] like Hitler or somebody
93:28 whomever pick pick a bad guy and you die
93:32 and you're floating out of this place
93:34 you're looking down at your body or
93:35 whatever and then the whole truth of the
93:37 whole universe comes to you at least
93:39 where you are and what you are and the
93:41 ecosystem of all souls and where you've
93:43 been in the past and what have you
93:46 there's the idea of like this residual
93:49 sin karma all that kind of stuff I just
93:53 don't think it attaches to you because
93:55 there are people that beat their kids
93:58 and their kids turn into serial killers
93:59 and like you're gonna really blame the
94:01 kid it's because the [ __ ] parent
94:03 probably had an [ __ ] parent what an
94:05 [ __ ] parent just keep going up or
94:07 it's a it's a clean cut family it's
94:09 never had any problems but the economy
94:11 crashed so much the dad couldn't provide
94:14 for his family became a drinker
94:16 because alcohols more available now that
94:19 it's ever been in the entire world
94:20 history and he had the gene to to become
94:23 an alcoholic and so then he gets
94:26 belligerent and strange and starts
94:27 beating his kids so there's this
94:28 inception moment that it wasn't the
94:30 father's fault but he destroyed his
94:34 children he destroyed the generations
94:35 underneath them but nothing else if they
94:37 didn't become drinkers then I got a
94:41 friend of mine he was abused by his
94:42 father and he did become an alcoholic
94:44 but he immediately got into a like
94:46 really fast to stop the cycle in his
94:48 early 20s and he knew that he was abused
94:51 and so his outward personality is the
94:55 most tolerant amazing dude ever and he's
94:59 really there for you and you could tell
95:01 him stuff but he has anxieties because
95:04 there are certain things echo has passed
95:07 he's also a very clean Clinton
95:11 cleanliness person clean person huge
95:13 hygiene thing not just personally but
95:15 the whole house
95:16 and everything and I haven't asked him
95:18 but I assume that one of the
95:20 Disciplinary reasons why the father
95:23 could rationalize hitting him was to say
95:26 your room isn't clean you made a mess
95:28 you know and it's like so he still has
95:30 that residual algorithm of I can't let
95:34 things be dirty because I might get hit
95:36 again you know so the minds of weird
95:39 machine know it's a million miles from
95:42 the Nazi thing but use this particular
95:46 one because there's so little evidence
95:48 of anything other than what I've just
95:49 told you if you think there's a bunch of
95:52 evidence somewhere evidence not just
95:55 conspiratorial videos and that kind of
95:57 stuff definitely share it in the comment
96:00 section but you know every once in a
96:03 while when you see things like Bigfoot
96:05 for me is just a laughable thing I think
96:07 it's my episode 300 right I think I
96:11 decimated theories 200 or 300 one of the
96:13 two where I just went through the whole
96:16 thing on my brain live with you guys and
96:18 it just all came to me during the
96:19 episode work which is like where is the
96:21 breeding cycle of a Bigfoot you know
96:25 woman a female Bigfoot's gonna have to
96:27 attract him mate she's gonna be pregnant
96:29 for god knows how long we carry a baby
96:31 for nine months wouldn't a hominid carry
96:33 it for ten months to a year then this
96:35 kids born and it's very weak and can't
96:38 fend for itself it's gonna be literally
96:40 food for coyotes and so this mother's
96:43 gonna have to nurture the baby up to a
96:45 point I can walk around and be safe and
96:47 then the father is gonna have to be
96:49 there to protect the mother so finding a
96:51 and it's probably be a harem based
96:53 creature just like lions and monkeys
96:58 okay so where's where's all the nests
97:01 and stuff and so for me it just totally
97:04 fell apart sometimes you have to go down
97:06 the path to figure out where you are
97:08 with a particular theory and I want to
97:12 finish up this episode with something
97:14 it's a utility that I have used a lot in
97:17 the past it's gonna sound a little
97:19 esoteric but I was listening to a Kanye
97:22 West song called I thought about killing
97:25 you I think is the name of the song it's
97:27 a very interesting song but in this
97:29 lyric he says
97:30 I've told you guys a couple times in
97:32 episodes and I've never heard another
97:34 human being say it so when he said I was
97:36 like oh this is cool it would like
97:39 mindedness right but because you are an
97:43 algorithm of truth and what that means
97:45 is the mathematics that keep you alive
97:48 and keep you human instead of turning
97:49 into a dog for two seconds and then a
97:51 snail and then back to yourself because
97:54 all that's perfect when you ingest a lie
97:58 the reason why I eat you alive inside is
98:01 because it is is an untruth is
98:04 mathematically not something that
98:06 occurred in time or it's not a state of
98:11 mind that you have you like I love you
98:12 baby and you don't rate I mean that'll
98:14 eat you alive
98:14 eventually now what is it Rosie
98:17 O'Donnell as much as I'm not gigantic
98:20 fan of her political views she was
98:22 quoted as telling your children you know
98:25 what happens to people who lie they get
98:26 cancer and they die and as much as
98:30 that's a brutal statement and it's
98:32 obviously representing a time line
98:33 that's very quick I think that's true I
98:36 think people who lie constantly you
98:39 wouldn't want to be in their shoes men
98:41 but one of the things you can do to test
98:43 your beliefs is to this is part of the
98:47 lyric he was talking about he he
98:50 basically said you know I'm gonna say
98:51 this out loud to see if I believe it and
98:54 that is a gigantic tool you can use as a
98:57 human being because we're sentient if
99:01 you think you believe something and I
99:03 mean this is anything personal your own
99:05 personal view of yourself personal view
99:07 of someone else you think you hate
99:08 somebody or heat something you think you
99:10 want to her do someone harm that's a
99:12 decent one where you hear yourself say
99:16 these things and then you'll see
99:17 yourself from like you know the 60,000
99:20 foot view saying these potentially
99:23 horrific things or things you simply
99:25 just don't believe you'll feel your
99:27 heart and your soul and your body reject
99:30 something if you don't believe it and
99:34 that gives you a full-blown
99:37 three-dimensional way of really
99:40 expunging and out of you it's almost
99:42 like your own exorcism
99:43 you're getting the demon out by
99:46 identifying the demons existence within
99:48 you you know it's like if you eat the
99:50 Black Apple go see my episode called the
99:52 black Apple it is a an idea from outside
99:56 that you've ingested whether it be from
99:57 society or some demonic force or
100:00 whatever it is it's convincing you to be
100:02 angry just be suspicious that sort of
100:05 thing and eat you up and you start
100:07 treating people weird even though
100:09 they're not really doing you any harm
100:10 but in your brain you've manifested this
100:12 whole story that doesn't exist it
100:14 doesn't have to be that detailed you
100:17 might try it on some of these
100:18 conspiracies one of the things I do
100:21 because I lecture from time to time you
100:26 know students and what have you or if
100:28 I'm gonna have a really intense meeting
100:30 with someone who is really brilliant and
100:32 super talented and I want to kind of
100:34 just prepare you know like it would
100:37 almost be the same example of being a
100:39 presidential candidate and going up for
100:41 debate these people practice and the if
100:43 they paid good people Blumberg doesn't
100:45 seem to have any of them you practice
100:48 all the questions that might come at you
100:50 that to tear down your character or put
100:52 you in a weird position where you don't
100:53 seem like you know what you're talking
100:54 about and then you know it will it will
101:00 give you every branch in the tree which
101:02 is a story analogy for how we write
101:04 screenplays you know if you have a
101:06 premise of you know that Terminator
101:08 coming from the past from the future to
101:10 the past to kill John Connor we'll just
101:13 think about it you know you have ten
101:15 writing teams let's just say just as a
101:16 college experiment there's four writers
101:18 in every team and you give them that
101:20 premise and they've never seen the movie
101:21 before because the Terminator was never
101:23 created and you go write me the story of
101:26 how the human beings that are normal in
101:30 the present time defeat this being from
101:33 the future you don't even tell him John
101:35 Connor comes back you just let him see
101:37 if they come up with that storyline and
101:39 you're gonna have ten different scripts
101:42 so that's how I practice and that's how
101:44 I make sure that I've got everything and
101:46 you know jeez 99 times out of 100
101:50 virtually everything I prepare for
101:52 doesn't occur in the conversation you
101:55 know if I'm lecturing a practice
101:57 the lecture that's different that's me
101:58 having a bunch of students looking at me
102:00 and I'm just trying to boil all the
102:03 analogies down to where I think their
102:04 brains are at their age try to use
102:07 analogies that they understand either so
102:09 generic that everyone gets it or if
102:12 there's some topical thing that they are
102:14 into I can throw that in there as well
102:16 but yeah with these kind of fringy
102:19 conspiracies give it a try I think
102:22 that's all I got on this one if you made
102:25 it to the end thank you so much
102:26 hopefully this was entertaining if you
102:29 haven't subscribed please do so if you
102:31 have a light and you dug it like it our
102:35 ratios are pretty good with that kind of
102:37 thing but I think if anyone doesn't like
102:40 it half the time they just shut it off
102:41 but you know our average view time is
102:44 going up up up I think at this point of
102:47 this recording we're forty five forty
102:49 five point five years no it was a forty
102:52 five forty seven that's forty seven
102:54 right forty seven point five years of
102:57 listen time so it's pretty amazing so
103:00 you take all the minutes listen to on
103:01 YouTube and stack them up together and a
103:04 kid would be forty seven and a half
103:06 years old which is kind of cool be
103:08 interesting to see what that's the
103:10 statistics are in other channels because
103:11 you know some of these other channels
103:12 probably have a person who's like a
103:13 thousand years old one of the fun ones
103:16 we're looking at on YouTube which has a
103:18 lot of great stuff and it's called your
103:20 daily dose daily dose of internet it's
103:22 this kid he makes these compilation
103:24 videos of just cool stuff on the
103:26 Internet and he works to make sure that
103:28 he keeps you at least one thing will
103:31 blow your mind in almost every one of
103:33 his little episodes there's a moon one
103:35 that's pretty wild where he I think it's
103:39 called I don't get it wrong but it's
103:41 sound like that we're like late it's
103:44 like liberation or something Deborah
103:46 it's when you take a picture of the moon
103:47 and it actually does shake and a little
103:49 circle if you take a picture of the full
103:51 moon and every time it happens because
103:52 of its wonky orbit it's still the same
103:56 face but you do actually see a little
103:58 bit of the sides that you didn't see in
103:59 the previous one it kind of wobbles and
104:01 so I had said that that should occur I
104:04 was talking about something different
104:06 but it's rotation but anyway if you have
104:08 been to deep thoughts radio.com that's
104:10 the same
104:11 brain trust of the whole operation I am
104:14 behind on some of the podcasts at this
104:16 exact moment so I'm going to get those
104:17 up soon I've been extremely busy on a
104:19 brand new project that's blowing my mind
104:22 so plus writing and writing and writing
104:24 and writing so up there
104:27 just book market and you know just in
104:28 case the show gets moved you know if
104:30 YouTube gets draconian with it but up
104:34 there has a category list in case you'd
104:35 like to hear only one kind of video what
104:37 dreams you want NASA you want flat earth
104:41 it's all up there in indexed if you
104:42 think you've got a video that doesn't
104:44 show up one of the playlists which I
104:45 don't think anyone's got the time or the
104:47 patience to test such a thing let me
104:49 know and I'll make sure it's in the
104:50 right category but we have two video up
104:53 there YouTube a bit shoot but shoot
104:55 again is 1080p but it's also first in
104:57 them and protected please make an
104:58 account a bit shoot if nothing else you
105:00 don't just subscribe to me I think we
105:02 have about a hundred and forty five
105:04 subscribers which isn't much but it's
105:06 just nice to know we've got to back up
105:08 up there
105:09 we have all the podcast links you would
105:11 ever need so it's in the Apple Store
105:12 it's in the Google store and you can
105:14 just subscribe directly to the website I
105:16 use a product called podcast addict on
105:18 my Android phone I think it's fantastic
105:20 and I believe it goes all the way back
105:22 to episode 1 if you don't see episode 1
105:26 stuff in the podcast is because your
105:27 player probably limits you to about 350
105:30 of any of any show and since this goes
105:33 back way before that you won't find them
105:36 there but you can find them on the
105:37 website and download the mp3 directly to
105:39 your device and you can listen to it at
105:41 your leisure we are in social media we
105:44 have a lakh Facebook group with a bunch
105:45 of great folks haven't had a lot of new
105:47 members I mean honestly this year I
105:49 think they're like 3 or 4 unless our
105:53 moderators are pushing them in which
105:54 they have you're welcome to do we're on
105:57 Twitter I've been you know experimenting
106:00 with Twitter a little bit during this
106:01 campaign thing there's so much [ __ ]
106:03 up there it's unbelievable but it's in
106:04 my opinion it's the most hateful
106:05 platform on planet earth so I try not
106:07 spend much time on it but I do publish
106:09 the feet up there as well and as mine's
106:12 calm which is the First Amendment
106:13 protected Facebook copy which is
106:16 beautiful and really cool and I hope it
106:17 takes over if we could just have a
106:19 public event where Donald Trump says go
106:22 to a minds calm and bone
106:24 the whole platform explodes plate crash
106:26 but I think it's a great platform we
106:30 also have a couple ways to donate to the
106:31 to the movement to the page whatever it
106:35 does help pay for cigars and all kinds
106:36 of stuff
106:37 scars about ten bucks so I try to get it
106:40 down to about four by buying them in
106:42 boxes but I don't always do that but
106:45 it's PayPal you're totally anonymous
106:47 when you donate I have not been able to
106:49 find a receipt of who did what I just
106:50 get a notification somebody's been put
106:52 in there the monthly subscription is
106:54 over at patreon if you haven't heard of
106:57 that so you just put at least $1.00 in
106:59 even think about it you put a buck in
107:01 it's 12 bucks a year but what you get
107:03 for that is you get the episodes before
107:04 everyone else you get a 20% discount on
107:08 the store plus you really get a closer
107:11 proximity to me because there's a lot
107:12 less traffic up there and anybody who's
107:14 donating cash is gonna get my attention
107:16 first and just because they're they
107:19 really feel the the project so it's cool
107:22 again all the season one episodes aren't
107:24 on this channel they're on a separate
107:26 channel and that channel is right at the
107:27 top of the navigation I've edited them
107:29 all to be shorter faster and get rid of
107:32 some copyrighted music I was using
107:34 unfortunately there's also a store so
107:37 there's two shirts up there which you
107:40 can get in hoodies and all kinds of
107:41 stuff
107:42 I'm literally my shipment should be in
107:44 any minute now so I'll start wearing
107:46 those unfortunately it's gonna be a
107:48 little cold for another month or so
107:51 before I'll be able to wear those just
107:53 out here by themselves but we'll get
107:56 them up there but yeah they're gonna go
107:58 away as soon as the season's over and
108:00 then we'll figure out we're gonna do
108:01 after that honestly we need NASA to lysa
108:05 more so I can make some more episodes
108:06 bottom but other than that thank you for
108:10 joining thank you for making it to the
108:11 end of the episode I appreciate you all
108:13 very much hope to hear from your
108:14 comments on all videos a few of you just
108:17 comment like crazy and I apologize I
108:19 can't get to all your comments with
108:21 intelligent replies but I savour every
108:23 single one of them even the ones that
108:25 tell me to go after myself and just
108:28 means you care take care of yourself and
