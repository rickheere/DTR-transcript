00:00 [Music]
00:26 you
00:34 good evening ladies and gentlemen and
00:36 good morning welcome back to deep
00:39 thoughts for those of you coming in on
00:42 video you can see we're at the cigar
00:45 lounge why are we at the cigar lounge
00:48 and not the garage not the back yard
00:51 because the back yard is freezing during
00:56 the day we are having SuperDuper high
00:58 winds which would make recording
01:00 impossible and the garage well it's just
01:05 this is cold so you know let's just
01:09 enjoy the ambience so some cigars
01:16 wall-to-wall I smoked this Maduro
01:18 wrapper Macanudo
01:21 excellent stick burns long so today I'm
01:27 gonna talk about something that's the
01:32 bounces around a lot in this location as
01:33 a matter of fact which is the debate
01:36 about what could actually scientifically
01:39 occur in a true vacuum now there are
01:45 tons of texts about this whole subject I
01:48 have not read all of them I have not
01:49 even read 50% of them but it's something
01:53 that once you start studying the fabric
01:59 of the universe you know and I've spent
02:01 at least a good twenty years plus
02:02 probably down or thirty years studying
02:04 the unified theory as they would say
02:08 which there's varying definitions on
02:11 what the objective is of a unified
02:13 definition for me it was what is the
02:16 universe made out of down to the
02:18 smallest instance of a particle and then
02:23 if you have that one thing that you
02:26 think is there and can you explain up to
02:29 where we are today and explain
02:31 everything like many of you who follow
02:35 me in this last year I believe that
02:38 using Eric dollard's rediscovery of all
02:45 of the first electric
02:47 Engineers as I always say for her date
02:51 of Tesla it explains everything now the
02:55 stuff that I presented to you I haven't
02:57 seen explain anywhere right so I want to
03:00 review a few these concepts that you
03:02 throw concepts because it's been
03:03 something that just mulches in my brain
03:05 all day long as I see the world do
03:09 anything a car does this a bubble does
03:11 that a puffy cloud floats over my house
03:14 I am studying those objects those higher
03:17 constructs in terms of ether all winds
03:21 ether particles compensating for all
03:25 things and let me tell you I am yet to
03:28 be remotely thrown for a loop so it's
03:33 good sign so with that in mind I think
03:35 we have the opportunity to discuss the
03:39 possibility that things in a vacuum may
03:45 not perform the way we think they do and
03:46 that a vacuum itself might be a lie so
03:51 let's review just because we have to
03:54 start talking about the fabric of the
03:55 universe in order to have a conversation
03:57 about what is a vacuum right a vacuum in
04:01 its purest sense is a space a cubic
04:05 space which again is sort of hard to
04:09 quantify because in a vacuum
04:12 what is quantifiable right how do you
04:14 say there's one inch in a vacuum you
04:17 have to have a non vacuum area with us a
04:21 higher construct living being with the
04:23 idea and concept of reference to say
04:26 there is something else over there right
04:28 one of the secret projects of we started
04:32 working on a couple years ago was a I'm
04:37 letting it simmer right now as I
04:40 invented a or I am inventing a scripting
04:45 symbolic language such that we can
04:50 account for and discuss freely concepts
04:55 of infinity so if I start talking to you
05:00 about infinite this infinite
05:01 and then I want to start talking about
05:03 something in the infinite I must either
05:07 continue in the infinite spectrum of
05:09 conversation or I must withdraw from an
05:13 infinite something a subset of infinity
05:17 and have a discussion about that
05:19 of course infinity is divisible as well
05:22 as exponential so I started creating
05:27 literally like a calculus language where
05:30 we could start writing these things down
05:31 and my goal is to create a language that
05:36 can be written in formula form that
05:40 allows the mathematician - perhaps
05:44 crossover into the more existential
05:50 mindset that's necessary to contemplate
05:53 these things right for you know any
05:55 physicist to sit around oh yeah well
05:57 it's just infinity we know infinity okay
06:00 well that's great but you're
06:02 automatically blowing your own [ __ ]
06:04 mind when you start talking about
06:05 infinity because you can't conceive of
06:06 it you can't conceive of infinitely
06:08 small you can't conceive of infinitely
06:09 large so in order to have an intelligent
06:13 dialogue you know we've got expressions
06:16 in mathematics today that the go at this
06:19 but it's all based on the quantifiable
06:24 non infinite concepts which the human
06:27 mind can conceive oh so my symbolic
06:29 language is is its goal is to come up
06:33 with a way for us to feel just as
06:36 satiated and at ease with the infinite
06:40 as we do with the finite and then again
06:44 start to contemplate things like the
06:46 conversation we're about to have would
06:47 be a perfect conversation to to discuss
06:51 with this language
06:52 I call it my infinity project the
06:56 Infinity project in case you guys
06:58 referenced it to me later
06:59 that's what it's called now we we live
07:07 in a world where one we don't need to
07:10 talk about any this kind of stuff right
07:11 it's not imperative that we have this
07:13 discussion
07:15 but we do because we're curious and for
07:19 some of us anything that is unknown
07:23 just piques our curiosity right and I
07:26 just add aggressive for a split second I
07:28 really think that mankind's insatiable
07:31 appetite for the unknown is simply
07:34 because those who have taken on the
07:37 infinite burden of protecting and either
07:39 themselves or others they know that
07:42 unknowns are the historical point where
07:47 we have lost life right let's go in that
07:51 cave a lot seems safe it's raining
07:53 outside Thunderbolts and lightning we
07:54 don't know what the [ __ ] those things
07:55 are made out of but let's go in there
07:57 because I think it'll be a little bit
07:58 better and then oh [ __ ] there's a bear
08:01 in there there's a lion in there and we
08:03 just got eaten alive or it seems pretty
08:06 good we went to sleep and then all of a
08:07 sudden bugs are eating us up you know so
08:11 the unknown is where the the Chieftains
08:14 the protectors the alphas go in solve
08:18 all those problems and then say it's
08:21 safe I cleared this place out
08:23 I burned a bush and put it in there and
08:27 got rid of everything that was alive so
08:29 for those of you who consider yourselves
08:31 mathematicians or physicists or what
08:34 have you any type of scientists of any
08:37 kind you know what you're sort of the
08:39 barbarian alpha male alpha female Omega
08:43 I guess female that is out there trying
08:45 to you know assess risk and trying to
08:49 expand consciousness and expand man's
08:52 capability right we didn't always have
08:56 bicycles and combustion engines and you
09:00 know gliders and things like that it
09:02 took people thinking about it going well
09:05 I first thought we couldn't and then we
09:07 did and then I did and then we all do so
09:10 the vacuum as I said in just a recent
09:13 episode NASA has several designations of
09:16 vacuums I believe it's five core
09:19 designations and then within each core
09:21 designation there are technically
09:25 infinite levels of designations but like
09:27 they break it down
09:29 another five or four or something like
09:30 that they built these really huge
09:33 facilities trying to create vacuums and
09:36 at least they're being honest about the
09:38 fact that they cannot achieve a true
09:40 vacuum and of course you can't because
09:43 you can't stop ether of particles from
09:44 flowing but what would a vacuum be now I
09:50 think that most of us understand that
09:52 time is an illusion
09:55 lunchtime doubly so and it is our
09:59 persistent existence in this universe
10:02 that allows us to recall previous states
10:06 in the universe and therefore when we go
10:08 back and have a memory of a previous
10:11 state which is just an amazing thing
10:13 that we actually have that capability we
10:17 call that time I was smaller then I got
10:22 bigger and I'm gonna get smaller again
10:23 as I turn into a really old man there
10:26 you go
10:27 a vacuum obviously we are going to
10:30 discuss or we're going to need to
10:33 discuss an instance of infinity let's
10:36 just say the universe is a an infinite
10:39 symbol and we need to just say okay is
10:44 there any place in the universe where
10:46 it's a true vacuum again NASA will lie
10:51 to your face they've been lying to me my
10:53 entire life saying space is a true
10:55 vacuum absolutely at face value it's got
11:02 to be the most ridiculous assertion that
11:06 any scientist could have ever made ever
11:08 ever ever how do you think light gets to
11:11 us there buddy
11:12 right how would there be any force that
11:16 would be considered to be gravity even
11:18 with their shitty phenomenon mass pulls
11:21 against mass completely wrong model of
11:23 gravity it has to have a substrate it
11:29 has to have something that is carrying
11:32 the wave to us right from one star to
11:35 another one star to a planet or what
11:38 have you you can see space in which we
11:41 can
11:42 and there you go you've got a medium by
11:45 which things must travel so let's just
11:47 say you and I are going to come up with
11:49 a true conceptual vacuum and of course
11:52 scientists have thought up true
11:54 conceptual vacuums but we have this a
11:57 cubic foot not on earth
12:01 somewhere out there and the less
12:03 traveled distances between let's just
12:07 say space exists between the put this
12:10 way we'll go to the furthest gap between
12:12 two bodies in space and say at least
12:15 that should have minimal of emissions
12:17 right it's a cubic foot and inside that
12:22 cubic foot for a particular unit of time
12:24 that we agree on a nanosecond a minute
12:28 an hour
12:29 [ __ ] millenium right this thing is
12:34 absolutely positively by serendipity or
12:38 by intent absence of any form of
12:42 anything that we could describe in any
12:45 conceptual form of existing it not only
12:48 lacks ether particles but it lacks the
12:52 energy that would make up a person's
12:54 soul the untrackable the intangible it
12:57 is truly a vacuum ok it's an ABS vacuum
13:03 all right an absolute vacuum all right
13:07 now let's just say that we are gonna
13:09 back off the absolute purity of this
13:12 definition in the next step down and
13:14 we're going to simply say anything that
13:16 man can't track by way of reaction or
13:19 actual tangible physical mass it can go
13:24 through that area and we don't care
13:26 because we're really just concentrating
13:29 on the stuff that builds us right now
13:32 again in this world of deep thoughts
13:35 radio we have ether particles for those
13:38 of you who are new to it it was a I'll
13:41 just give you the super duper recap
13:43 Faraday through Tesla they had tracked
13:46 heathrow particles 50 times the speed of
13:48 light they use a big giant wire and wave
13:51 it to measure that speed using
13:54 electrical currents
13:56 get out disturbances and electrical
13:57 currents the best way to think about how
14:02 ether forms the entire universe is sort
14:06 of a magic trick if I had a little CG
14:09 team off to the side we could create a
14:11 really cool graphic and I'm gonna give
14:14 you two stages to this and again the
14:20 hardcore listeners you guys have already
14:22 heard this but I'm gonna probably shave
14:25 a few words so maybe it's worth
14:26 listening again you have a pool of water
14:29 and you have a current right one of
14:33 those little tornados going down to a
14:35 dream or maybe it's just a current out
14:38 there in the river
14:39 it's where the it's where the river hits
14:43 the pylon the holes up the bridge
14:44 all those little currents out there
14:46 right now when you see that you see what
14:50 you see a conical tornado going down to
14:53 some relief valve down below in the
14:55 course of your in case of your sink or
14:57 your bathtub is going down to actual a
15:00 pressure release which is the pipe but
15:04 even in nature the top surface can move
15:06 at a different speed than the bottom and
15:08 that creates compression the spiral and
15:10 down below it's moving slower and that's
15:12 it's vacuuming out sort of like an
15:14 einstein-rosen bridge thing right all
15:17 right it almost gave you jazz hands
15:19 there
15:19 those were ether hands it's my own
15:22 little special spin off now the reason
15:26 why it's going down your whole life is
15:28 why because there's a gravitational
15:30 force pulling down to the earth
15:33 all right and again that's created by e
15:36 throw winds which we'll get to a little
15:38 bit later now if I could snatch that
15:42 tornado out of the water and still have
15:46 some water right and then I remove any
15:49 gravitational force that is creating
15:51 that that little backbone right down the
15:53 center it would spin into what a sphere
15:58 that is exactly how all mass in the
16:05 universe is created there is no down
16:07 force in the universe
16:10 don't listen to Neil deGrasse Tyson
16:11 he'll tell you that there is there's a
16:13 [ __ ] up-and-down in the universe
16:14 which is why the world is pear-shaped
16:16 right
16:17 I think he's pear-shaped but when you
16:20 pull this out and you remove gravity
16:22 then you get a sphere another way to
16:25 think about it is sort of a bubble in
16:27 water what is a bubble in water it's a
16:31 bubble trapped in this all present stuff
16:34 called water well now you take that
16:37 exact mathematical model of how water
16:40 pushes on air to create a bubble and you
16:43 and you lighten up the forces okay
16:46 replace water with ether and replace
16:49 replace the bubble with a plasma ball of
16:53 energy which is super fast-moving ether
16:55 that hasn't slowed down enough to get
16:58 its Sigma 5 designation as a cork or
17:01 whatever and you have earth because on
17:05 the outside of this crust of this plasma
17:08 ball it's going to start drying up it's
17:11 going to start cooling off it's not big
17:13 enough to do what the Sun does which is
17:16 to create all kinds of wild fusion
17:18 reactions on the outside surface so one
17:22 of the big questions that comes up about
17:23 a vacuum especially at this location and
17:26 downstairs is that they asked me they go
17:30 will do does a rocket engine work in a
17:33 vacuum now as a knee-jerk reaction
17:37 you've got two different paradigms that
17:40 you can go well yeah I'll do it of
17:41 course it does
17:42 right well the first one is is that
17:44 you've been told your whole life that it
17:46 happens that motors in a vacuum actually
17:50 light up push off something and get the
17:53 vehicle to go in particular direction
17:55 yet everything that we actually launched
17:58 into space has its momentum by the time
18:02 it supposedly slingshots out of Earth
18:04 orbit and again if I make one episode
18:07 where I don't say yes but the slingshot
18:10 theory is [ __ ] then I'm gonna get
18:12 someone and tippy tapping on the
18:14 keyboard yeah and hearing is [ __ ]
18:16 yeah we all know it's [ __ ] okay
18:17 chill out but the other paradigm is what
18:23 science fiction science fiction has
18:25 shown us a million times motors you know
18:29 the Millennium Falcon holdbacks trip
18:31 lights up you've seen my god Battlestar
18:36 Galactica Star Wars at least Star Trek
18:40 had a warp field but Buck Rogers
18:43 episodes from the 30s then again in the
18:46 70s Forbidden Planet did not use that
18:50 which was cool so that brings up
18:53 something something very interesting and
18:57 I know a lot of you think about this but
19:01 you might if you're like me you'll think
19:02 about it a lot more than you actually
19:04 pass it on to other people which is this
19:09 we live in an ecosystem that uses ether
19:14 all particles and you throw winds to
19:18 live in a much different environment now
19:22 the laws of physics and the laws of
19:24 mathematics of which many of which have
19:26 not yet been discovered to explain the
19:28 universe itself electrical universe
19:30 getting a lot closer but again they
19:32 they'll say a bunch of great things in
19:34 biological universe but they won't
19:37 mention ether it's like they're [ __ ]
19:38 terrified of being called a Sun flat
19:41 earther or something right
19:42 ether explains absolutely everything and
19:47 I mean everything right when a certain
19:49 Hadron Collider pounds two protons
19:51 together in the opposite direction
19:53 all it's doing is its pounding a part
19:57 they super tight orbital connections
20:01 that create the proton in the first
20:03 place out of ether a-- winds but the
20:06 force and the organization of the impact
20:09 is not pure and it's not perfect and so
20:12 you do not get a throw particles well
20:14 they could they probably need to adjust
20:16 their algorithm what they think is
20:18 ambient noise is these were particles
20:20 and most likely but they're getting
20:22 other higher constructs the corks
20:26 popping out of these things that and
20:29 probably subatomic to that and so they
20:32 track all these things down and they try
20:34 to figure out how they behave so it's a
20:35 noble effort
20:37 I'm not looking for the Big Bang okay
20:39 everybody with the [ __ ] brain knows
20:41 the Big Bang didn't happen okay it's
20:44 it's unbelievable how many science
20:46 teachers around the world okay they they
20:49 went to school and they went right back
20:50 to school right so they graduated and
20:52 then they started teaching before they
20:53 ever did anything interesting in life
20:55 and so to them they know they're they
20:59 know that their knowledge is out of some
21:02 book they've never experienced that they
21:05 never dealt with any scientific
21:07 experiments they never ventured out to
21:09 see if they were full of [ __ ] and so
21:11 they know this deep down inside so when
21:13 you start talking to them and telling
21:15 them hey dude you know I understand why
21:18 you have that because when you graduate
21:19 1975 and what is it [ __ ] 2018 2019
21:24 now I think things have changed right
21:28 but they built the CERN Hadron Collider
21:30 based on some [ __ ] that that Higgs
21:33 boson dudes right they had graduated in
21:35 the 60s and 70s and they built a 10
21:39 billion billion euro device which now is
21:43 cost another 10 billion looking for the
21:45 Big Bang supposedly right and they want
21:47 to find the multiverse particle versus
21:49 the single air single universe particle
21:52 they lied throughout through their teeth
21:55 go see my episode on the CERN Hadron
21:57 Collider shame shame shame that our
22:02 vacuum in a vacuum it is unclear whether
22:10 or not one could bring an object into
22:13 the vacuum we see all the time
22:16 diffusion where you might have like a
22:21 container full of smoke and you open it
22:25 up and what happens the smoke goes out
22:27 and diffuses into the room perfectly
22:29 evenly over time and then you're looking
22:31 around the room and you're like where
22:33 the hell the smoke go well it's here
22:35 honey it's just all diffused all over
22:37 the place okay now I want you to imagine
22:42 that once you take an e throw object
22:45 which is everything that we know is mass
22:47 period
22:50 energy and if you were to take it in I
22:53 think push it into our cube so you had a
22:55 basketball and you just push it into the
22:57 cube that is a vacuum well I'm going to
23:01 speculate that because the medium by
23:04 which the basketball is created which is
23:06 an ether will wind it's just gonna
23:08 unravel you just push it in there and as
23:11 soon as the edge starts penetrating the
23:13 true vacuum it just starts dissipating
23:16 and your ether particles are probably in
23:18 there if you could somehow contain it
23:19 but it's not a basketball anymore it may
23:22 never be a basketball anymore until you
23:24 push a hell of a lot more ether in there
23:26 which is pointing the guy got some
23:27 rubber now right now the idea of a
23:30 rocket engine seems pretty sound you
23:34 have a cone you blast something inside
23:37 the cone which is going to create a
23:40 force against the cone which should move
23:44 the cone and then who cares where the
23:46 fire goes hopefully it's not a child
23:48 sitting on the outside of this thing but
23:50 then that's what moves it down the road
23:52 I think I'm gonna come up with the same
23:57 exact answer everybody had before I
23:59 started the episode and you're gonna go
24:00 yeah big deal I think all these engines
24:03 work in space because there's not a
24:05 vacuum period right if you were to say
24:10 the bubble in the water where you got a
24:12 bunch of water and a big fish tank and
24:14 you got a bunch of bubbles everywhere so
24:16 you turn the pump off so it calms down a
24:18 little bit now in your mind you do not
24:22 acknowledge water existing all right my
24:27 custom jpmorgan [ __ ] wants to sell
24:29 you it by the drop right see this stuff
24:31 doesn't exist in the universe only I can
24:33 make it right okay well what happens to
24:39 your mind when you say the water doesn't
24:43 exist in a fish tank our water doesn't
24:45 actually exist the liquid itself doesn't
24:47 exist in a container of which contains
24:49 bubbles well [ __ ] now it looks like
24:52 bubbles just float in thin air they go
24:55 up and they go down right and it's
24:57 really kind of water pressure inside
24:58 there right and again for those of you
25:01 you want to say that gravity is an air
25:03 pressure model
25:04 it's not an air-pressure model but it's
25:05 the same same exact mathematics it's an
25:08 ether or pressure model so keep the same
25:11 exact idea pat yourself on the back but
25:13 stop saying it's air okay
25:15 it's ether and it's everywhere and it's
25:19 weak gravity is a weak force okay
25:23 that's because it's just little bumps
25:24 and Nick's from this stuff that's
25:26 everywhere right why is it important to
25:29 discuss this vacuum topic I would have
25:35 never thought it actually made any
25:36 difference to be honest you know once
25:41 you look at you know the universe and
25:42 you can see light transferring from one
25:45 place to another regardless if it's a
25:48 transverse wave or a longitudinal wave
25:51 meaning it's instantaneously from one
25:54 star to your eyeball doesn't matter for
25:58 it to have the verbal reaction that it
26:00 does the ripple in the pond remember you
26:02 can't grab a ripple out of the out of
26:04 the pond and you can't grab a photon out
26:08 of the universe well could you do you
26:11 could change the shape of water maybe
26:13 and you could get the ripple to do a
26:14 different thing you could change the
26:18 speed of water and it will interfere
26:20 with the speed of the wave that's coming
26:23 otherwise at you right so you can move
26:25 the water away from yourself then that
26:27 ripple is going to take a lot longer or
26:29 it might even die off all of the rules
26:33 that apply to water apply to ether okay
26:37 at least the mathematical principles
26:39 like bruce lee said be like water right
26:42 what happens when we realize that once
26:46 we understand ether and again they've
26:50 always taught you this is what's always
26:51 kind of funny they've always taught you
26:53 that to understand electricity just
26:55 think about water moving through a pipe
26:57 and it's great and so now we're going to
27:00 use the same exact methodology of
27:02 understanding ether by looking a bodies
27:06 of water except we must erase from the
27:09 algorithm the downward motion that is
27:12 created by the earth for those of you
27:15 are new to the show
27:18 gravitational forces / waves are nothing
27:21 more than the obstruction of ether winds
27:24 from one body to the next so the earth
27:28 for instance is being hit from all sides
27:30 constantly alright everything's being
27:33 pushed down by the what the water that
27:36 holds the bubble together is the ether
27:38 that holds the earth together same thing
27:39 with the Sun the moon and everything
27:40 else that exists in space but now what
27:43 if what happens when you introduce
27:44 something like the moon well the moon is
27:47 now close by relatively speaking and
27:50 it's blocking some of that impact to
27:54 earth and so between the earth and the
27:55 moon we get this negative pressure it's
27:58 just enough because the earth is big
28:00 enough ten times bigger than the moon
28:04 looks like eight times bigger it's going
28:08 to hold the moon in place now of course
28:10 they're telling you this [ __ ] story
28:11 which might be true but that it
28:14 completely redefines everything that the
28:15 moon is gonna just float away like space
28:17 1999 theory right when in any orbital
28:22 model the orbits decline and the objects
28:26 come in and collide with their their
28:29 centralized object right so we're
28:31 supposed to be colliding with the Sun
28:33 eventually the Sun is so massive okay
28:36 million times bigger than the earth and
28:38 volume right I think it's was a thousand
28:41 times bigger than Jupiter in volume that
28:43 it's blocking so many winds that when
28:45 you see Einstein god bless his being
28:50 their syndrome even though in the end
28:53 Peter cells was actually a smart guy and
28:55 walked on water but when you see that
28:58 gravitational coda a sort of general
29:00 relativity pool table he had where he
29:03 throws the ball and it's got the grid
29:04 and it goes down it's like the opening
29:06 credits to the movie black hole back in
29:08 the day that is actually happening on a
29:12 three-dimensional level of course but
29:14 it's happening due to the obstruction of
29:16 a throw winds okay now for all bodies in
29:20 space very similar to the electrical
29:24 properties that we see again there'll be
29:28 an orbital core of a
29:31 any particle that's made out of ether
29:33 like the guy you build Coral Castle said
29:35 there's a photon at the center of any
29:36 what of what we call an atom okay but
29:41 you're going to have II throw particles
29:42 that that hit directly on the ball that
29:46 is a particular proton electron Neutron
29:48 whatever it's gonna hit
29:51 I shouldn't say electron proton or
29:54 neutron right it's gonna hit and it's
29:56 gonna bounce back it's gonna be a direct
29:58 ricochet
29:58 that's the dielectric wave that I always
30:00 talk about the other one goes in an
30:02 orbit it's trying to hit it but it's
30:05 getting hit by all of its buddies and
30:06 it's trying to make that path and so it
30:08 goes and around in an orbit and that's
30:09 your magnetic field around this object
30:12 it's happening in all dimensions right
30:13 so you have this dielectric wave popping
30:16 off in all directions and you have this
30:18 orbital thing happening in all
30:19 directions when the dielectric hits the
30:21 magnetic you have electromagnetism
30:23 that's where you get your electron great
30:25 now assume that thing up to the size of
30:28 the Sun one of the big experiments for
30:32 einstein was that he said that during
30:35 eclipses if general relativity is
30:37 correct the light behind the Sun is
30:41 gonna make a beeline around the Sun and
30:44 come to our eye so we're gonna be able
30:46 see stars around the Sun and it took a
30:49 long time and his competitor was
30:50 actually the first one to see a full
30:52 solar eclipse it was in Canada and he's
30:55 looking he goes ah [ __ ] the dudes right
30:57 yep Einstein hey hey you got me those
31:00 pads you stole it off those other guys
31:02 those dudes were really smart I won't
31:05 tell anybody either but why did that
31:08 happen in our model why did that happen
31:10 in our model because there is a ton
31:15 quite literally IV throw particles that
31:18 are hitting the body hitting the surface
31:21 of the Sun and bouncing out of the Sun
31:23 as well as the Sun is pretty much a nice
31:26 constant ejection of mass but as the sub
31:30 it's the sub atomic energy that we call
31:34 II throw particles they have no charge
31:36 they're not positive they're not
31:37 negative a positive and negative is
31:39 simply because when one of them turns in
31:42 a one direction and the other one ends
31:43 up turning in the other
31:44 action there positive and negative right
31:48 and they get along the way I like to
31:51 explain positive and negative and II
31:52 throw model is to say again never think
31:55 of anything really having a positive or
31:57 negative when you talk about ether or
31:59 particles but if you had to Formula One
32:01 tires that are going in opposite
32:04 directions which doesn't happen but
32:06 they're out there an open entire race
32:08 and they touch each other ones going one
32:10 way and ones going the other way they're
32:12 gonna get along fine aren't they in fact
32:14 they might even draw towards each other
32:15 right but if you make them spend in the
32:18 same direction which what happens when
32:20 they race because they're all going in
32:21 the same direction now you could say
32:23 let's just say for the sake of arbitrary
32:26 designation there are two positive tires
32:28 okay they go backwards there two
32:31 negative tires but if there are two
32:33 positive
32:34 tires what happens when they touch
32:35 they're orbiting they're going in a
32:37 circle of course it's only a
32:38 two-dimensional thing called a tire but
32:40 as soon as it hits BAM
32:42 one of the cars starts popping in the
32:43 ear okay that is opposites attract and
32:49 similar polarities repel each other
32:52 that's all it is people you throw
32:55 particles are agnostic to anything but
32:58 they bounce around just like currents in
33:00 a river they're arbitrarily they're
33:02 simply because of things that they
33:04 bumped into okay now is there a gigantic
33:07 conversation about the is of ether
33:10 particles hell yeah
33:12 you know you have three designations of
33:15 the universe there are three models
33:18 which I talked about a thing in the very
33:20 first episode one you have an infinite
33:23 amount of particles in an infinite space
33:24 you have a finite amount of particles in
33:27 a finite space or you have a finite
33:29 amount of particles in an infinite space
33:31 right I don't think the fourth one can
33:35 exist which is an infinite amount of
33:37 particles inside a finite space so at
33:40 some point man needs to solve for one of
33:42 those three ideas and what's happening
33:45 today is and it's a valiant effort
33:47 mathematicians way off in the
33:51 theoretical realm are starting to use
33:53 you know the use of Mathematica and they
33:55 create some crazy shape and then they
33:58 start
33:58 closing on it the nature of the universe
34:01 and they say man I just created this
34:02 crazy you know spear that turns inside
34:06 out in the center and stuff and and that
34:07 now is the universe that's a model of
34:10 the universe and we're out there on the
34:12 edge of it you know swimming around
34:14 maybe we're a big mobius strip I don't
34:17 know maybe we're living on the outside
34:18 of a sphere I don't know but what I do
34:21 know is that some of the smartest men in
34:24 the world figured this stuff out called
34:27 ether and there we go
34:28 so the first thing we need to stop doing
34:30 in my opinion is talking about vacuums
34:34 as if they actually exist I mean the
34:36 ones that sweep up the [ __ ] after I drop
34:37 a bunch of ashes on the ground those are
34:39 very useful but the the idea that space
34:43 has a vacuum I don't know if I were to
34:48 postulate the purest place where a
34:50 vacuum might exist would be the center
34:53 of the Sun the center of the earth the
34:56 center of any celestial body that is
34:59 created out of some spinning seer of
35:02 plasma energy and and I I say plasma a
35:05 lot it probably is technically a false
35:08 designation that I'm giving you because
35:11 we don't have words that I know of for
35:13 you know they're like tachyons and other
35:15 conceptual particles but if you were to
35:18 say ether is moving 50 50 times the
35:22 speed of light in its pure form before
35:24 it starts to collide and slow down then
35:27 it would be something probably just
35:30 above plasma where it starts to go
35:31 invisible there's a lot of videos going
35:34 around about the power transformer that
35:36 blew up in New York and there's a couple
35:38 other ones that happen
35:39 you see this during any type of you know
35:41 stormy cycle of any cities history when
35:45 transformers started going but when you
35:47 start to see those big giant Jacob's
35:49 Ladder
35:49 you know super-bright just blinding
35:52 bright arcs of electricity on wires the
35:55 ones that make all the cool sounds
35:58 that's plasma energy it's slow moving so
36:03 we can see it right but you know what's
36:05 the what's the one unifying thing about
36:07 the Sun you don't look at it because
36:08 it's really [ __ ] bright what do you
36:10 do when you try to look at playas
36:12 energy popping off of power power line
36:15 any of you have seen it anyone if you've
36:16 looked at arc welders you can't look at
36:19 them they'll burn your eyeballs up
36:20 because the verb coming into your eye is
36:23 so utterly violent the rods and cones in
36:26 your eyes will be vibrated to death they
36:31 will simply cease to exist like a frayed
36:33 piece of beef jerky you've just had in
36:35 your mouth or own cigar right your body
36:38 might repair and it might not right when
36:42 I did the episode about the space travel
36:45 I discussed building a UFO type ship
36:50 right and it was during the recording of
36:54 the episode that it hit me that if we
36:57 were to ever truly create a vacuum
36:58 anywhere in our world okay that it could
37:03 be a very dangerous object to create I
37:05 don't mean to be an alarmist or anything
37:07 but let's just say I created a some sort
37:11 of spaceship it seats infinite number of
37:13 people because we don't any problem with
37:15 its propulsion system it's gonna run off
37:18 the the ether model which is sort of the
37:22 gravity wave engine that essentially
37:25 makes dents in the ether ax winds and
37:28 dust starts creating a negative pressure
37:30 any way you anyplace you want it right
37:32 see if you want to move up you make a
37:34 slight bump and the ether o waves above
37:37 you and the ship just falls into the
37:39 hole in very careful units of
37:44 measurement both from an area over the
37:48 vehicle and probably the time in which
37:51 it is allowed to exist all which is
37:54 going to be probably controlled by some
37:55 electromagnetic engine we have to be
37:58 super careful because whatever was there
38:01 is being displaced at a certain velocity
38:04 you know when you you look at your face
38:07 and a really funky mirror and you move
38:10 the mirror or you start using some of
38:11 the plugins on your telephone to distort
38:14 your face right well it's interesting
38:17 because if you have the spiral one it
38:20 starts over here and it's all spirally I
38:21 might be able to do this a photo in
38:23 Final Cut but it moves across
38:26 disturbs your face and then it moves
38:28 back and you're not worried that your
38:29 face is not going to come back into its
38:31 original position
38:33 now who knows if the universe has some
38:37 sort of elasticity that if we were to
38:40 destroy mass that would be in that
38:43 little pocket you know do we push or do
38:46 we just zap it into existence where
38:48 there's a vacuum of ether particles and
38:51 then the ship moves up into that little
38:53 cavern that's there right but the one
38:56 thing you can't do is use this engine to
39:00 create a bubble inside the craft itself
39:06 this displacement algorithm or
39:09 technology which doesn't exist that I
39:10 know of Bob Lazar says that exists an s4
39:14 but you couldn't have a human in there
39:17 because you would start to remove the
39:20 ether will flow that makes us exist
39:23 right going back to our spending water
39:26 in the sink that thing only exists that
39:30 little tornado only exists because water
39:32 is constantly refreshing its existence
39:35 you remove the water it doesn't exist it
39:39 doesn't get to take the water with it
39:40 just because you remove the water right
39:42 that's why those little tornadoes
39:44 disappear in your dream okay so imagine
39:48 that we're made out of I don't know
39:52 countless you know quadrillion time
39:56 quadrillion ^ quadrillion I'm out of
39:59 these little spinning ether all spheres
40:03 and you know hey they might have other
40:05 shapes too I'm just sticking with severe
40:07 because that's what we see in nature we
40:09 see it in planting some bubbles that's
40:11 pretty damn good right as it is above so
40:13 - is it below right well if you cut it
40:16 off then you cut off what you're made
40:18 out of and you simply who you just drain
40:21 out of your existence your soul is
40:24 probably fine runs off and does
40:25 something else because it's not really
40:27 affected by this stuff maybe or go
40:29 through a little slingshot you know move
40:31 or something like that but what your
40:33 body's made of is gone so it's
40:36 imperative that if man ever makes a true
40:38 vacuum
40:39 tool that you know if you're afraid of
40:43 the Hadron Collider creating some mandel
40:46 effects or some black hole which is all
40:48 [ __ ] right if you if you study ether
40:51 you immediately stop believing in black
40:52 holes like immediately it's just like
40:54 poof that's why they don't exist it's
40:56 over right could you create an object
40:59 that obstructs so much ether winds that
41:02 you're not going to have the verb of
41:03 light leave its surface I don't think so
41:06 okay I don't think so because the bigger
41:10 the object and more dielectric energy
41:12 you'd probably create the more magnetism
41:13 you create and again mathematics
41:17 absolutely denies the Big Bang from ever
41:20 occurring right you can go all the way
41:21 down to the Big Bang you get down to
41:23 those infinitesimal nanoseconds before
41:26 it even nano nano seconds or whatever it
41:28 is and in physics just falls apart but
41:32 you'll have somebody tell you a null
41:34 hokey story of creation is the way it
41:37 works the reason why I want to make this
41:40 episode is that I really feel like we've
41:45 had the foundation of science completely
41:48 stolen from us and you have cowards
41:52 online not people that just disagree
41:55 with you those aren't cowards you've got
41:57 people who do no research who are
42:00 cowards and they just get all [ __ ]
42:03 butthurt run around on YouTube and they
42:07 have these little text files on their
42:09 computers by the way they've written
42:10 this little diatribe whatever pitches
42:13 their point I just had one of these
42:15 douche bags today and they cut and paste
42:17 it and then YouTube immediately sees
42:19 that that comment has come from that
42:21 person multiple times across tons of
42:24 videos all right we just had a total
42:28 coward about the moon come in and he did
42:30 this [ __ ] snowflake thing in ours
42:33 comments how dare you but but but but
42:36 but and here's a bunch of [ __ ] links
42:38 out to NASA to tell you how it all
42:40 happened right he's a guy ends up in
42:44 those compilation videos on YouTube
42:46 we're under in his mouth and getting his
42:48 ass kicked at a Denny's
42:50 so we need to fight back and start the
42:52 conversation over again I think at its
42:56 absolute fundamental level are there
42:58 mysteries out there oh hell yeah the one
43:01 I talked about which is how's this whole
43:03 universe held together right it does
43:07 seem like there is some sort of even
43:11 higher construct to ether which does one
43:15 thing and that is provide a sort of a
43:21 container if you will for its ability to
43:24 move on the container surface or within
43:27 the container itself that's where your
43:29 mind starts popping right we seem to
43:32 have a lot of beautiful randomness which
43:37 creates all the cigars by me me I'm
43:39 different than you you know your day is
43:41 different than mine the universe isn't a
43:45 carbon copy of itself from left to right
43:47 top to bottom right it's the evidence
43:49 that the Big Bang never happened so
43:52 chaos is allowed to exist within
43:54 whatever container that we're in right
43:58 if there's a vacuum it's only conceptual
44:02 on paper at this point is there a
44:05 designation of a container with very
44:08 little tangible mass in it that we
44:12 actually designate from a table that we
44:15 actually have here on earth
44:17 sure again NASA so far has been pretty
44:21 honest about being only get about only
44:25 being able to achieve about half the
44:26 distance to what they consider to be a
44:28 true vacuum but again NASA doesn't
44:31 acknowledge that ether exists so their
44:33 ultimate definition of a container that
44:37 is a vacuum is probably flawed but it's
44:41 okay it's okay simply just it's not okay
44:43 for them to be flawed and be
44:44 closed-minded but they must draw the
44:47 line to say okay man isn't going to be
44:50 able to probably create unless we start
44:52 getting into electromagnetic force
44:55 fields something that actually is a has
44:58 a complete void inside of it of no ether
45:02 right now can we track where ether goes
45:06 so that we could to see whether or not
45:08 we've created a vacuum well you can
45:11 sense ether on a wire
45:12 okay so perhaps through some shear
45:18 algorithms are figuring out what is the
45:20 ambient average ambient either in a
45:24 particular zone on the world with
45:25 experiments being conducted you know you
45:28 could do it in some space station if you
45:29 get out there but we simply say okay
45:32 from here to here point A to point B the
45:35 flow through this area is usually this
45:38 many ether all particles ^ you know
45:42 infinity now we are going to build a
45:47 build a machine that has these wires all
45:52 over a 3-dimensional ball I'm just going
45:55 to use that as an arbitrary shape we're
45:57 gonna energize the valence of this ball
45:59 and we're gonna watch to see if the if
46:03 the sensors actually double up triple up
46:05 and quadruple it see Thurl density
46:08 because they're not going through the
46:10 ball see I'm saying but whether or not
46:13 we could actually sense their being
46:16 ether in there we probably put a little
46:18 wire inside the ball on the initial test
46:21 to see if the wires like man it's
46:23 absence of any collision but since the
46:26 ball is made of ether the wire is made
46:27 of ether again we may not be able to
46:31 ever achieve a true vacuum so one of the
46:34 I think misconceptions about trying to
46:39 sense whether or not space is a vacuum
46:41 whether it's denser or or lighter in a
46:45 particular area is in relation to what
46:49 one is looking for right again I can't
46:52 stress it enough we grew up in this
46:57 microcosm that is our planet right and
47:02 so we are oxygenated we have a relative
47:06 gravity force due to this ball that
47:09 we're sitting on you know some of you
47:11 don't believe that but you got some
47:14 explaining to do if you want to review
47:15 that so it's hard for us to pull out of
47:20 the paradigms that keep us alive it's
47:23 hard to pull out of the paradigms that
47:25 make us die
47:26 we are conceived of inside of our
47:30 mothers right boy and a girl gets
47:34 together sorry folks
47:36 and they procreate and there is you have
47:38 this microscopic little heartbeat that
47:41 goes all the way up to being born we
47:43 live hopefully we'll get a nice stretch
47:45 of life and then we decay and we die so
47:49 for us everything has a beginning middle
47:51 and end everything but when we look at
47:54 the universe of course we believe in
47:56 [ __ ] theories like the Big Bang you
48:00 know time well again it's it's all up
48:04 here it's all about us being able to
48:06 recall previous States now conceptually
48:08 speaking since I know I was a young boy
48:11 and I grew up at least I think that's
48:12 what the simulators telling me we
48:15 project that onto the universe and of
48:18 course we know that ok if there's a
48:21 little tiny pock mark on the surface of
48:24 the moon of volcanic Electric pockmark
48:27 routinely misclassified as a meteor
48:30 impact we can conceptually say without a
48:35 big degree that didn't exist at one
48:37 point and then it did exist right okay
48:41 so we infer time onto the universe it's
48:46 better understand it and so for us we're
48:48 going well surely it didn't exist
48:51 forever right I mean [ __ ] nothing exists
48:54 forever and then you go well why do you
48:57 say ashes to ashes and dust to dust
48:59 right why do you say we return to the or
49:03 the the soil of the earth it is then
49:06 toiled and harvested and it creates
49:08 nutrients and then mom eats a dad eats
49:10 it they create another life and that
49:13 life consumes the earth's bounty'
49:15 lives a life dies and returns back to
49:17 the Earth's bounty it's in an infinite
49:20 cycle right in front of your face
49:21 spiritually you're taught that
49:23 reincarnation is a sin
49:25 you're not to think of that [ __ ] if
49:27 you're a Christian why God built a like
49:30 I always say God built a the greatest
49:32 amusement park on planet earth the best
49:34 [ __ ] ride ever
49:35 and you only supposed to ride it once
49:37 and then you got to sit up there in that
49:38 cage eating cornbread forever or
49:42 something I don't think so an infinite
49:45 cycle of life is something that man
49:49 struggles with and I think more so than
49:53 struggling with the infinite paradigm of
49:55 a numeric set right if I said well
49:57 numbers go up forever you're like yeah
49:59 they do don't they ooh that hurts my
50:01 brain I don't need to think about that
50:03 yeah he probably don't but then again if
50:06 I said go get me the letter eight and
50:07 bring your number eight and bring it
50:09 over to me you can't but if I said go
50:14 get me a rat that's like six months old
50:16 oh yeah go down pet store here here's a
50:19 rat they got it on video being born six
50:23 months ago and so it's six months old
50:25 there you go okay so now it's tangible
50:29 when you bring the infinite cycle and
50:32 the recycling of the universe again as
50:36 it is above so tuza below and you bring
50:38 it down to tangible life and you say
50:40 that the human body is going to decay
50:42 and turn back into the earth and be
50:44 reborn yeah we don't like that one do we
50:49 one it gets a lot of people's fear of
50:53 death to begin with but then we don't
50:56 like to be thought of as like my body's
50:58 gonna rotten in some hole somewhere and
51:01 burnt up into ashes and then thrown out
51:03 of some boat into the ocean and I get
51:06 nibbled up by frigging fish at some
51:09 point hmm if an ether of particles that
51:13 need to a particle then it never changes
51:18 it stays ether the whole time
51:21 it can't be dented it can't be removed
51:23 from circulation
51:25 it doesn't vaporize we think things burn
51:31 because ether gets to a point of high
51:36 velocity unraveling
51:38 in a way that we no longer view it as of
51:41 what it was right a carbon-based life
51:44 form a log that burns and turns into
51:47 it's inert car carbon well it's no
51:52 longer what it was a piece of tissue
51:54 paper that just flies away right now I'm
51:58 in my late 40s so for me what I think
52:03 about anything I am limited by the
52:09 paradigms that I have struggled one of
52:12 the paradigms that I've accepted without
52:13 even knowing it the ones that I've
52:15 accepted that I'm aware of and the ones
52:17 that are putting pressure on me that
52:21 that have been on me my entire life
52:23 either they be genetic limiters where my
52:26 brain can only think of an image
52:29 Gestalt e image it's only in a certain
52:31 size right those paradigms and all their
52:34 combinations of being willingly accept
52:37 that are just serendipitously imposed or
52:41 they're what I'm actually made out of
52:43 the ones that I'm actually made out of
52:46 they're just a matter of fact right they
52:49 govern my ability to conceive of what I
52:53 am saying to you right now now here's
52:57 the cool part us old-timers we got a we
53:00 have to constantly peel away the layers
53:04 of the onion probably better analogy
53:08 would be we have several coats of paint
53:11 on us and so we're peeling these coats
53:15 of paint off right trying to see well
53:18 what's the what's the first the designer
53:21 of us what was the first coat of paint
53:24 was there any paint on us is a primer am
53:27 I made a gold I want to know and so you
53:29 just keep peeling it away and peeling it
53:30 away but off you raise a child in an
53:36 open minded world but at no point do
53:39 they actually have anything imposed on
53:41 them and any paradigm they do except
53:46 always comes with a qualifier when the
53:49 qualifier sounds a bit like this
53:52 for now this is what I'm using to deduce
53:59 what I call the truth now in a pure
54:02 world they could be born into a world
54:04 where there were no lies around them
54:08 there were only assertions and hunches
54:11 and you know there are laws physics
54:15 there are chemistry's or one of the
54:18 coolest things because chemistry things
54:21 do what they do
54:22 glass melts at a certain temperature you
54:26 know chemistry does what it does have we
54:29 discovered everything that you can do in
54:31 chemistry hell no and that's the
54:32 beautiful thing about it right but the
54:35 periodic table is built out of laws of
54:38 how things work but now imagine you
54:42 raise a kid in a world like this one
54:45 well like I always say there's things
54:49 being imposed on if they go to a very
54:51 special school from the very very
54:52 beginning where again we learn how to
54:55 read right we do a little bit of
54:57 arithmetic get them all built up
55:00 properly so they have a high level of
55:03 vocabulary and communication
55:04 capabilities on the mathematical side
55:07 they can solve for any problem whether
55:10 they got to do it by hand with a slide
55:12 ruler or a big-ass calculator then get
55:15 it done but then when they have to start
55:18 going out into the universe going out
55:20 into the world maybe the kid you know
55:23 it's it's more it's more interesting if
55:26 the kid has a fairly dynamic world like
55:29 I grew up in Kansas so I had you know we
55:33 didn't really have forests but we had
55:35 woods and we had streams and ponds and
55:38 you had crops so you got to see how life
55:41 works how farmers plant things and
55:43 harvest things so in the Almanac was
55:46 something that was mentioned quite a bit
55:47 because it was the guide that helped
55:49 everybody succeed now if we can just
55:53 destroy him on santo we'll get back to
55:56 that but now imagine this little trick
55:59 in your head here if you took a bunch of
56:02 kids out and you didn't explain things
56:04 to them
56:04 I'm not saying we should do this but we
56:07 should might be able to give them a bit
56:08 of a warming up period right where we
56:12 say for a certain amount of your life
56:14 we're going to inundate you with the
56:19 exploration of life you're going to go
56:21 out to a stream you're gonna pick
56:23 through rocks and a little smooth rocks
56:25 and then some chunky your weird rocks
56:27 right you're gonna look at a fish a
56:30 little tiny fish and we got a tadpole
56:31 you look at birds and and everything you
56:34 get my point
56:35 but we let them discover it we let them
56:39 make connections that perhaps we're not
56:41 making and then when they start asking
56:46 questions and boy do they ever start
56:48 asking questions at one point we're
56:51 ready with the more conceptual answers
56:54 and we just say well we have worked
56:59 really hard before you were born
57:00 try to figure this question out to
57:03 figure out the answer and there's a few
57:07 going theories now what if we were to
57:10 lay down the Big Bang and we say okay
57:13 well for a long time we thought the Big
57:15 Bang was the way it started and then we
57:18 did a little bit of anthropology and
57:19 figured out that man had already created
57:21 that story fifty thousand years before
57:23 it was turned into a mathematical
57:26 algorithm and oh by the way when we
57:28 finally put it inside the math that it
57:31 needs to take place to make this exist
57:33 it crumbled same thing with this black
57:36 hole thing they created dark matter to
57:38 try to cover up the fact they didn't
57:39 have enough mass that creates a big bang
57:42 and then we did the mathematical model
57:44 the Big Bang and if anything was that
57:45 perfectly singular and it blew up then
57:48 the top and the bottom and the left and
57:50 right that all be symmetrical and we
57:53 figured out that life the life itself
57:56 doesn't exist in a full symmetrical
57:58 world there has to be a random number of
58:00 particles between 3 & 4 2 & below turns
58:05 into a pattern 5 and above turns into a
58:08 pattern life can't exist in those
58:11 designations but it can exist between 3
58:13 & 4 hmm then we spring ether on them
58:18 right I just think how that mind would
58:21 mature over time because the concepts of
58:25 what they're asking would mature over
58:26 time
58:27 imagine you never told a kid that light
58:32 existed you let them discover light
58:38 obviously existing on the planet Earth
58:40 there'd be day and night and the
58:43 variable gradient when it was coming and
58:45 going hmm but women a child ask you
58:51 what's light what is this stuff
58:54 the stuff that's on my hand it makes it
58:56 warm you know I'm doing like little
58:58 shadow puppets on the ground what's that
59:01 big thing in the sky that's really
59:04 bright what do you call that stuff it's
59:07 a great moment in the Hitchhiker's Guide
59:09 of the galaxy
59:10 so in the whale spawn into existence
59:14 falling to earth that keeps flowing to
59:18 nag Rafi isn't he
59:20 but Douglas Adams did an amazing job
59:23 crafting the dialogue of a whale first
59:28 waking up as a whale and he's falling at
59:31 terminal velocity and he's trying to be
59:33 really upbeat but he has no idea that
59:36 he's gonna die he has no idea that he's
59:39 necessarily falling he waves his tail
59:42 and he's all what's this I know what it
59:44 is but I really like waving it about
59:47 it's I think I'm just gonna call it my
59:49 tail yes it's my tail and he goes what's
59:52 this stuff coming up at me really really
59:54 fast it's sort of round round round and
59:57 I'll call it ground yes and then his
60:00 last phrase is I wonder if it'll be
60:02 friends with me wooshii it's the ground
60:05 and explodes right meanwhile the bola
60:07 Petunia says oh no not again
60:10 I have this feeling that modern man
60:13 would pay to be theoretically
60:18 lobotomized back to that point to
60:20 rediscover everything to kind of just
60:22 say everybody go away stop telling me
60:25 vacuums exists right just stop let me
60:28 observe
60:29 let me make up my own line please
60:31 provide with the most objective I would
60:38 say descriptions any theory that you
60:42 think may or may not participate in my
60:45 reality this episode is all over the
60:48 place but I think it's hopefully fun and
60:50 entertaining for you guys I'm having fun
60:52 it's good cigar I did an episode called
60:56 consensus reality it's not my idea
60:59 plenty of people many many hundreds of
61:03 years before I was born thought about
61:04 this but the idea is that man and his
61:08 consciousness is creating the universe
61:14 through our bias we create the universe
61:21 when you start thinking about how big
61:23 the universe is you start to think well
61:25 that's probably not true unless what we
61:29 really are at the soul level at the core
61:31 operating system level is so much bigger
61:36 than what we are today that we actually
61:42 have this back processor that can hang
61:45 on to all the stars regardless of what
61:48 they are you're hanging on to them
61:49 you're hanging on to this fur that is
61:52 the Milky Way pretty of you've remotely
61:55 gone outside in your lifetime and you
61:57 look at a sand on the beach or the the
62:00 water in the ocean you conceptualize for
62:04 a second how much volume metric space
62:07 weight life variance of life are in that
62:12 ocean that you can stare at seems way
62:15 beyond the cons the concept of mankind
62:17 right but then you have perhaps a
62:21 conceptual vacuum the conceptual vacuum
62:25 would be the old question if a tree
62:30 falls in the woods and no one's there to
62:31 hear it does it make sound for those of
62:35 you who've ever dabbled in programming
62:37 video games especially first-person
62:40 shooters or
62:41 you know infinite scrollers like world
62:44 of warcraft for an MMO most of you know
62:47 that as soon as you are moving in a
62:51 universe the computer has a limited
62:54 amount of memory especially for infinite
62:56 scrollers right for those of you who
62:58 don't know I'm talking about you're on
63:00 the surface of a world and you can walk
63:04 in any direction you want turn the
63:05 camera face anywhere you want and you
63:07 can walk infinitely until you fall off
63:10 the edge of the world or go on a big
63:11 loop usually their continents but
63:15 they're so massive would take you all
63:16 day to walk from one side to the other
63:18 well the game is not holding the whole
63:21 world in memory at once it's not holding
63:23 all the textures all the event loops for
63:26 all the animals that are running around
63:29 it dumps out of memory anything that's
63:33 not in a really large halo that you
63:36 can't see the edge of right so it's
63:38 getting rid of it and getting rid of it
63:40 if you just walk north from South okay
63:42 you're at the bottom of a continent
63:44 you're walking north and you're you're
63:45 gonna keep looking this way looking
63:47 north and never gonna look behind you
63:49 everything behind you and that little
63:51 halo is going away hmm well now based on
63:59 what I'm telling you
64:00 ether is always active it's always
64:03 everywhere at no point is there a vacuum
64:05 simply because we're not thinking about
64:07 it because that would hurt especially
64:11 the butterfly effect of all the forces
64:13 in the universe right I didn't think
64:15 about the moon today because I didn't
64:17 see it today oh [ __ ] it doesn't exist oh
64:19 [ __ ]
64:20 it threw everything out of whack right I
64:22 didn't see Jupiter today oh man geez
64:25 some people sleep through the Sun they
64:28 never see the Sun oh my god the Sun
64:29 doesn't exist today
64:31 the consensus reality idea is that
64:33 someone is always saying and someone is
64:35 sort of handing off the idea so we
64:39 conceive of a moon first person
64:41 conceives of the moon and puts it up
64:43 there well a bunch of people see it like
64:45 a firework oh wow what the hell is that
64:47 thing right and then for all time
64:51 there's someone staring at the moon
64:53 handing off
64:55 the theory handing off this construct
64:57 this mental construct to the next person
65:00 hmm makes you wonder right has someone
65:06 been looking at the moon for 20,000
65:10 years I mean they look at it it at all
65:14 times there's one human being what maybe
65:17 a dog maybe an insect they're all
65:21 looking at the moon you know it makes
65:24 you wonder you know insects love going
65:27 towards lights right take the ether
65:30 model now we're pretty big beings right
65:34 and ether particles would be so
65:36 incredibly teeny-tiny this might be sort
65:40 of a silly analogy but why do bugs love
65:43 lights I don't think it has anything to
65:47 do with their feelings secure because
65:51 they can see things cuz a lot of these
65:52 bugs are sort of like a little sonar
65:54 creatures right now the low-hanging
65:57 fruit
65:58 theory would be it's warm it's warm all
66:01 right I don't know how that attracts
66:04 bugs to a bug zapper in the deep south
66:07 where it's already in 95 degrees at
66:09 night it's not like the bug is going oh
66:11 [ __ ] man it's so cold out here no it's
66:14 warm the bug is already warm doesn't
66:16 need to go towards light but it does
66:17 doesn't it
66:18 well like I said about if we were to
66:22 create a bubble force field around you
66:25 forbidding all ether to go through your
66:28 body I think you would unravel and go
66:30 away but we're so big we sort of have
66:33 this localized ecosystem of gravity or
66:37 you know our organs make us feel a
66:39 particular way our brain makes us feel a
66:41 particular way we like shiny objects
66:43 there's a little algorithm in the brain
66:45 that when you see shiny things like
66:47 diamonds and gold we have this cocaine
66:50 little Rini action inside of our brain
66:52 that makes us feel amazing that's why we
66:53 like those objects thank God because we
66:56 wouldn't have an economy without it
66:57 hopefully we get back to that what if a
67:01 bug a teeny tiny thing in fact the
67:04 tinier the more elated this thing is a
67:07 little net
67:09 flies up to a light and he feels the
67:15 ether all winds blowing through him the
67:17 verbal reaction that is light and it's
67:21 like getting a back massage it's like
67:24 some sexual activity whatever it is it
67:28 is feeling totally and completely elated
67:30 to have the ether go through its little
67:33 frame and that's why you could put a
67:35 little bug zapper around the light bulb
67:39 and he'll just walk right into it right
67:42 we know that bees are being killed by
67:45 cellular towers this new 5g that's about
67:50 to roll out it's starting to roll out
67:51 may just absolutely be the coffin the
67:54 nail in the coffin for all bees and
67:57 maybe a lot more insects good luck being
68:01 kind after that one right but we have a
68:04 ton of animals that use the electrical
68:06 fields on earth the natural meridians on
68:09 earth to migrate part of that has to do
68:13 with expanding Earth theory that when
68:15 all the continents were together
68:16 whatever primal life-form
68:18 was walking over the crack that started
68:22 to form obviously they realized when
68:26 it's really cold migrate south when it
68:28 gets really hot migrate north and they
68:31 go back and forth but the direction in
68:32 which they migrate is based on a
68:35 prehistoric programing inside their
68:38 system as the continents started to
68:42 expand because the Atlantic Ocean rips
68:44 apart and the Pacific Ocean rips apart
68:46 creating new surface right they're not
68:49 sliding around the surface folks right
68:51 subduction doesn't exist Pangaea drift
68:54 doesn't exist that's all [ __ ] it's
68:56 all brand-new surface popping out right
68:58 those creatures
68:59 the only ones that could survive that
69:02 while sorry the ones that were fragile
69:04 had to migrate to survive and the rest
69:06 of the creatures can just stay where
69:07 they are
69:08 right the honey badger he's okay but
69:13 what would be these meridian lines that
69:16 go through their bodies the thing that
69:19 makes the compass point north
69:22 it's an ether wind it's a tiny ether
69:27 wind that's at the surface level of what
69:30 eventually about a thousand miles up
69:33 turns into a lethal band of radiation
69:36 that protects us from other radiation
69:39 from other bodies of space namely our
69:42 Sun let me pose this question to you how
69:47 important is it that we protect
69:51 everything that we've discovered to date
69:53 about science whether it be false or
69:56 true I think the obvious answer is its
69:59 some areas extremely important because
70:02 then we will regress and lose a lot of
70:07 our amenities that are getting us to the
70:10 next level of consciousness right
70:12 meaning if we were to return to the law
70:14 of the jungle
70:15 then the only thing that would matter
70:17 would be survival against each other and
70:20 survival against the elements right
70:23 trying to figure out you know the
70:24 seasons we'd have to live towards
70:26 equator again because we would lose the
70:28 ability to build shelters to dig water
70:30 wells you know to be sophisticated in
70:33 any way shape or form on a primal level
70:35 but what's really cool is that we have
70:38 proof we have absolute proof that primal
70:44 man got there very quickly what's
70:48 interesting about primal man and I would
70:50 say primal man defined as I would say
70:57 this is sort of an insult to the word
70:59 primal and insert insults of the people
71:02 I'm going to name but your ancient
71:03 Egyptians you're probably more African
71:07 Egyptians of course anyone born on the
71:10 continent would be considered African
71:11 but you know King Tut by all means was
71:14 not an Arab but as we see them today
71:18 whether or not that race exists at all
71:21 anymore I would think not they probably
71:23 have been cross bred or eliminated but
71:29 you had this beautiful marriage between
71:30 poetry and science no one would ever
71:34 deny that
71:35 pyramids were built out of the most
71:37 incredibly precise science the man has
71:40 ever discovered again we're sitting here
71:43 rubbing our heads at 2019 going I don't
71:48 know how the hell they built those
71:49 things I mean our theories of how they
71:52 built the pyramids suck isn't that
71:56 unbelievable
71:57 now I want you to go watch the next CG
72:00 movie that you see the next Marvel
72:02 Avengers what is it next time you see
72:06 the infinity war sequel right you're
72:09 sitting out at your TV or your movie
72:11 theater and you're looking at this
72:12 stunning 3d I mean the amount of
72:15 algorithms we have figured out to do
72:17 water it's just unbelievable Pacific Rim
72:20 all the waters fake men even rain half
72:25 the time it's fake it's crazy but we
72:27 can't figure with that without with
72:29 those brains functioning every single
72:31 day in creating artificial realities we
72:34 can't figure out how they built the
72:36 pyramids but what would the pyramids
72:39 based on what's clear they were based on
72:42 the stars they built the pyramids in
72:45 Giza based on the belt of Orion and then
72:49 a bunch of the other cities around Egypt
72:51 who are they're very very far away like
72:54 you can't see them with the naked eye
72:56 the buildings are built absolutely
72:58 perfectly aligned with the fully aligned
73:01 Pyramids of Giza to match exactly the
73:04 proportions of the stars in space the
73:06 ones that they thought were important
73:08 that they built into constellations in
73:09 their lore but now what else happened
73:13 well they married poetry with their
73:17 science right they believed in all of
73:21 the constellations having personalities
73:24 and and having a place in their life but
73:27 it's probably just an arbitrary
73:28 selection of brighter dots in the sky
73:31 now there's this someone came in the
73:36 comments and I can't remember who it was
73:38 but I commend them I told them I agree
73:42 with them in the comments but
73:44 they essentially said that you know when
73:47 it comes to white man's inventions white
73:49 man created white man things and when it
73:51 comes to African and infinite inventions
73:53 like the pyramids or Machu Picchu or
73:56 something it tends to go to aliens and
74:02 it looked like a sort of racial
74:05 degradation of their capabilities
74:07 intellectually well I would say it's
74:11 probably not that intentional I would
74:13 say that I would take it as the most
74:16 backhanded ultimate compliment ever
74:18 which is to say if one is to claim that
74:22 they're descendant of these individuals
74:24 which I don't think anyone is besides
74:26 all of us but it is if they so blew our
74:30 [ __ ] minds that were like aliens it's
74:35 like the oh it's like we have to have
74:36 some arbitrary unbelievably
74:39 sophisticated society participating in
74:41 the creation of these objects because a
74:44 man is a sitting here with seemingly no
74:48 limitation to our imagination when you
74:50 look at Hollywood and we can't figure
74:53 out how they did these things right the
74:57 subject of ether as I mentioned several
75:00 times that I'm gonna go a huge
75:01 digression into it but it's how the
75:05 pyramids functioned as gigantic power
75:08 plants right those of you are new the
75:12 inner limestone is super conductive to
75:14 electricity the outer limestone was
75:16 super non conductive as an insulator the
75:20 hallways are built out of red granite
75:22 which is called liquid rock in terms of
75:25 its electrical properties who knew you
75:30 know most most electrical engineers that
75:33 take a look at this thing say Jesus I
75:35 wouldn't want to be inside the thing
75:37 when it's turned on in fact there's no
75:40 torch marks right no one lived inside
75:42 the thing it wasn't a tomb okay because
75:45 we've seen tombs in the Valley of the
75:46 Kings and they don't look anything like
75:48 these objects but inside all of the
75:51 tombs and inside the master buzz and on
75:53 the walls you have mythical explanations
75:57 for things
75:58 mixed in with seemingly scientific
76:02 things a little bit what blows the mind
76:05 is this and I think this sort of gets
76:08 out the alien concept that these
76:11 individuals us the budding mankind came
76:14 from space soda goes like this and I
76:18 think you'll find this interesting if
76:22 they created this science of creating
76:26 pyramids while they were on earth
76:30 meaning they didn't know how to do this
76:32 and then they worked really really hard
76:34 over 50,000 years or whatever it took
76:36 them to do this to figure out pi to
76:39 figure out can conductivity II throw
76:42 winds all this stuff again remember
76:44 Tesla's Tower was based on the pyramids
76:50 it dragged power out of ether drove it
76:54 into the ground
76:55 through one Tesla coil that was wired to
76:57 go down into the earth it brought up
76:59 infinite electricity out into a
77:01 different Tesla coil which then can be
77:03 broadcast to your home at a low
77:04 frequency Andria metabolized into
77:06 electricity that we use today it was
77:08 torn down before it was ever activated
77:11 and now we pay for electricity but I
77:15 want you to put two visions in your
77:17 brain for this next analogy here over
77:20 here I'm gonna do my right your left we
77:25 have the pyramids and then we have tons
77:30 of writing right I mean if you read
77:33 hieroglyphs from back in the day you'll
77:35 find most of the parables that Jesus
77:37 told were written in hieroglyphs
77:39 thousands of years before this dude ever
77:41 existed if you go with a thirty-nine
77:44 thousand BC the timeline that has a lot
77:46 of evidence behind it man that's a long
77:48 time before this fabled person existed
77:51 right okay put that over here there's no
77:56 writing about how they built the
77:58 pyramids right there's a few sled
78:01 drawings and that kind of thing but
78:03 there's no ramp there's no nothing
78:05 there's no levitation okay now most of
78:09 the most of the pictures that I've seen
78:11 that show the sled with the person on
78:14 the sled whipping a bunch of people
78:16 pulling the sled that's not an image
78:18 that talks about how they built
78:19 something that's an historical
78:22 illustration of superiority or
78:26 what-have-you right I mean again you
78:29 know those could have been created after
78:32 the fact to give a false narrative about
78:35 what was actually going on they're
78:37 delicious put that over there as if it
78:38 was real on the right side okay of me
78:44 left you but I got those backwards just
78:47 now but you have Star Trek there is a
78:50 episode of Star Trek Voyager where
78:54 Captain Janeway and Chakotay are stuck
79:01 on a planet because they caught a virus
79:02 and there's long as they're on the
79:05 planet the virus doesn't kill them if
79:07 they leave the whatever the immunity
79:10 thing is that's in the air you know will
79:13 eat them alive right well they brought
79:15 what because they knew they were going
79:17 to be stuck on this planet for the rest
79:19 of their lives and they were the only
79:20 two that had these viruses and so they
79:24 ended up shipping down a ton of stuff
79:26 including a transporter but they got
79:29 every amenity that could be brought to
79:31 this this planet surface so they could
79:33 live forever
79:34 right all right yeah that's a spoiler
79:39 for you but if you watch the show you
79:42 know they're not going to get rid of
79:43 those two characters so they do solve
79:45 the problem in the show but let's just
79:47 play that forward hmm so Janeway and
79:51 Chakotay start becoming sort of husband
79:54 and wife they live I don't know if
79:57 they're gonna procreate or not she's
79:58 kind of old he's kind of old don't know
80:00 but what are they not going to do they
80:06 are not going to put a bunch of
80:08 hieroglyphs in their world explaining
80:10 how transporters are created they're not
80:12 going to create hieroglyphs about how
80:14 the warp engine works why would they it
80:17 worked when they got there and it's not
80:19 important to their existence what is
80:21 important to their existence let's say
80:23 that she was in her 20s and he
80:25 in his 20s and they did create a family
80:27 god bless all that incest right you know
80:31 the Egyptians were very ancestral to
80:34 well I should be careful saying that
80:37 because perhaps it was a false history
80:40 but anyway maybe one of the reasons why
80:45 the Egyptians never created the Hal to
80:49 manual of how they created pyramids
80:52 because they came to the earth with that
80:56 knowledge well understood plenty of
81:01 people plenty of elders they're always
81:04 passing it down to the next generation
81:05 you know the bent pyramids are not a
81:08 mistake they built hundreds of it built
81:10 bent pyramids right I think there's over
81:13 like 125 bit pyramids
81:15 there's pyramids out there that are
81:18 massive I think there's even a few
81:20 bigger than the Great Pyramid that have
81:23 been dismantled they look like kind of
81:26 big mountains of stone like cut stone
81:30 now we found the quarry so we know where
81:33 they dug these things and use them to
81:35 build things obelisks that are erected
81:39 that are massive we can't figure how
81:40 they did that there's even bigger ones
81:42 in the ground that were either dropped
81:43 and transport or they just were
81:46 abandoned
81:48 but they wouldn't archive the knowledge
81:52 if they already had it why do that right
81:55 now you would think they create a
81:57 university or whatever but hey if
81:59 everything is cool before like the you
82:01 know the Mesopotamians come in and start
82:03 battling them they're a peaceful nation
82:06 there are peaceful people then the
82:08 question begs how did anyone invade them
82:11 if they were the only beings on earth
82:13 right part of this entire discussion is
82:17 about how we come up with these concepts
82:21 to discuss in the first place the
82:23 beautiful thing about the vacuum is that
82:25 it is a hard thing to conceive of when
82:30 you really want to take it right down to
82:31 the rails and say there is a substrate
82:34 that holds all things together there
82:36 just has to be right well I can't just
82:38 push
82:39 across a void because what would it push
82:41 across it's a verbal reaction moving the
82:45 fabric that is the e throw fabric that's
82:48 how light travels if you didn't have an
82:49 e throw fabric you wouldn't have light
82:51 going anywhere if I would indefinitely
82:54 be a particle and then particles trying
82:57 to move across the universe but then
82:58 other particles trying to move across
83:00 the universe and all the light would
83:01 probably be utterly canceled out or if
83:03 it weren't canceled out we the whole
83:08 universe would be a big light bulb and
83:10 we be so blind now again our eyes can
83:13 only see a small fraction of the visible
83:15 spectrum that's probably how we do
83:17 survive we don't see x-rays or
83:19 ultraviolet lights at least I don't
83:23 think we do so now think about this show
83:26 I've brought along for god knows how
83:30 many hours over 400 hours probably on
83:32 the show right and there's plenty shows
83:34 out there with hundreds of episodes and
83:36 they talk to each other and they talk
83:37 about politics and other things but on
83:40 this show it's just me right I'm talking
83:43 you guys now are in the thousands
83:46 responding back to me and so I'm able to
83:48 take this in as a cyclical loop so it's
83:52 not just my show anymore right
83:54 by the way I've made provisions at home
83:56 for your suggestions which in the past
84:00 would have to remain in my memory or I'd
84:02 lose them so now when you guys make
84:04 suggestions I've got some electronic
84:06 techniques of archiving your ideas that
84:09 then I can go through a lot a lot more
84:11 detail so from this point forward 330
84:16 plus episode mark if you make
84:19 suggestions they will be archived and
84:21 explored to my best ability but just
84:25 sitting here talking i've enhanced
84:28 myself just hearing my own voice and
84:31 thinking of things a little bit further
84:34 your guys's recommendations back to me
84:36 and your feedback back to me has greatly
84:39 enhanced even more than my own personal
84:42 feedback but where do we have to go
84:46 where can we go excuse me in this world
84:48 where we can get this kind of
84:50 conversation
84:51 anywhere in the planet besides your
84:54 backyard your living room where let's
84:59 say you pick out a major university
85:01 let's pick out a few of them Caltech MIT
85:04 Oxford and Cambridge there's plenty of
85:08 other amazing institutions out there I
85:09 just skipped let's just use those two
85:12 from America too from the UK I think
85:16 it's the what we consider to be our top
85:19 two in America and the top two in
85:20 Britain what happens when you go to a
85:24 university and park your car if you know
85:26 anything about universities this is the
85:28 feeling you'll start having you're
85:30 walking into an institution you have big
85:33 respect for the institution because
85:35 those institutions have pioneered
85:37 regardless that they're right or wrong a
85:39 bunch of different thought processes
85:41 right brilliant people of all walks of
85:45 life have gone through those
85:46 institutions from all kinds of different
85:48 countries all different genders whatever
85:50 right but there is a hidden force
85:56 usually what we call the ten year force
85:58 T in ure that puts pressure on you to
86:03 remain within the narratives that they
86:05 have discovered you're not supposed to
86:07 go outside of the envelope unless you're
86:10 heavily controlled now I have an episode
86:13 I think it's in might be in season one
86:16 it's definitely no later this season two
86:18 called the unknown and it's a whole
86:21 episode about this this formalizing of
86:25 the unknown such that we have a
86:26 protected place to go to discuss things
86:29 and I don't believe quite frankly that
86:32 those exist you know we need an
86:35 institution that is created from scratch
86:38 again as I always say if we get a chance
86:40 to rebuild the planet from the ground up
86:41 this is I think one of the chief goals
86:44 that we have there are that we have to
86:46 maintain we have to develop and nurture
86:49 that we create a university that when
86:52 you park the car it's sort of a mix of
86:56 all four of those universities that I
86:58 mentioned and every other one that's
86:59 amazing out there but it's mixed with
87:04 the unknown with what we might term is
87:09 magic right again the Willy Wonka
87:11 Chocolate Factory analogy is one of my
87:14 favorites when you watch the movie from
87:17 1973 with Gene Wilder you get the sense
87:23 that when you're going to Willy Wonka's
87:24 chocolate factory in the fictional sense
87:27 that it is there are no limitations that
87:32 guy is the last guy that's going to tell
87:34 you you can't do it
87:35 what did we see in the film we saw Oompa
87:39 Loompas doing all kinds of wild stuff a
87:41 river of chocolate right some crazy you
87:46 know cave that the the ship went through
87:51 we saw him making candy out of like
87:55 boots and all kinds of weird [ __ ]
87:57 there's a fizzy lifting drink thing you
87:58 drink some soda and Yeltsin you can fly
88:01 you know one girl ate the the meal gum
88:06 and she turned into a blueberry one girl
88:11 got into a room with a bunch of golden
88:14 eggs
88:14 she was a bad one and she dropped
88:16 through and Mike teavee flew across the
88:19 tea flew across the room and
88:21 materialized inside of a TV it was a
88:26 world where anything was possible and
88:28 that's why those movies are so important
88:31 as they were initially made because when
88:34 they were remade all that magics pulled
88:36 away all that Magic's flushed down the
88:38 toilet
88:39 it's about Willy Wonka and his dad and
88:42 his dad's an [ __ ] dentist right the
88:46 original Willy Wonka I mean I know this
88:49 sounds like a crazy analogy to bring up
88:50 at this point but I said it a long time
88:53 ago I want to say it again so you guys
88:55 know especially you newcomers the 1973
89:00 film had a character called slugworth
89:03 slugworth was a guy that went around to
89:05 everyone who won a golden ticket and he
89:07 whispered in their ear if you bring me
89:09 back an Everlasting Gobstopper from
89:11 inside the Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory
89:13 and you bring it to me so I can
89:15 reverse-engineer it I'll give you
89:16 whatever it was
89:18 thousand pounds whatever it was at the
89:21 end of the film sorry to spoil it for
89:24 anyone who hasn't seen this it won't
89:26 change a thing
89:27 trust me I get goosebumps every time the
89:30 final line is spoken because it is a
89:32 magic that I think we've lost and we
89:34 need to find a way to take it out of the
89:38 artistic fictional world and put it into
89:40 life okay
89:42 the kid Charlie Bucket gets all the way
89:45 to the end all the other kids have
89:46 screwed up so bad that they're gone
89:47 they're all getting fixed now the kid
89:50 screwed up too with his fizzy lifting
89:51 drinks but he managed to avoid death
89:53 narrowly and by burping you'll have to
89:57 watch the film you haven't seen it but
90:00 it gets to the very end and he's
90:01 supposed to to get a lifetime supply of
90:04 chocolate that's what everyone who gets
90:06 a ticket and signs the contract agrees
90:09 that they're gonna get but the kid did
90:11 mess around inside the fizzy lifting
90:13 drinks with his grandfather and he
90:15 touched it and that was against the
90:16 contract and that was the clause that
90:19 Willy Wonka use at the end to say he
90:21 gets nothing because you didn't follow
90:23 the rules and the old man calls him an
90:28 [ __ ]
90:28 you know and Gene Wilder plays this role
90:33 phenomenally and he just says sorry you
90:36 broke the rules and he screams and he
90:37 yells at this kid it's like the last
90:40 thing you would expect Willy Wonka to go
90:42 through right with a child but the kid
90:46 sees through it and he goes you know
90:50 what he says to himself I don't want to
90:54 walk out of here being a further
90:56 criminal than I already was I wasn't
90:58 supposed to drink to visit lifting
90:59 drinks I screwed up my lifetime supply
91:01 of chocolate so I'm gonna go ahead and
91:03 leave on a moral uptick the kid walks up
91:07 to Willy Wonka who's now pretending to
91:11 give a [ __ ] about something at his desk
91:13 and the kid pulls out the Everlasting
91:16 Gobstopper and drops it on the table and
91:19 turns around walks off and Gene Wilder
91:23 says the magic line is Willy Wonka as he
91:26 puts his hand takes his hand off what he
91:28 was doing he puts his hand on the
91:29 Everlasting Gobstopper and he's
91:31 as so shines a good deed in a weary
91:34 world could you think of a more
91:36 appropriate exiting statement for the
91:39 our society today but if anybody were to
91:41 be good in this world especially those
91:43 that are in politics or in banking or
91:45 whatever corporate control military
91:48 control to be able to say that about
91:51 them and he turns around to Charlie buck
91:55 and he says you've won and the kid says
91:58 what are you talking about and he goes
91:59 you've won and then out of the door
92:03 comes the slugworth guy and Charlie goes
92:08 or Willy Wonka says this guy right here
92:09 he works for me this was a test this was
92:14 a test to see if you were a little
92:15 bastard or if you had a moral fibre to
92:19 your body and you just gave back the one
92:22 thing that would have made you rich and
92:23 I know you're poor I know you live with
92:25 your grandparents right he was sitting
92:27 inside beds all day right and his mother
92:29 works ten jobs and all this other crap
92:31 right he delivers newspapers so he can
92:34 afford a loaf of bread for his family
92:36 but what the kid when he won the whole
92:40 joint he won the whole factory and Willy
92:44 Wonka said I needed to know that there
92:47 was someone like me to take this place
92:50 over someone who was good to the heart
92:52 someone who loved my stuff enough that
92:55 you couldn't resist the fizzy lifting
92:57 drinks but at the end of the day you
93:00 wouldn't steal something out of my
93:01 factory then they go up in the glass
93:04 elevator and they break through the wall
93:06 break through the ceiling and they fly
93:08 all over England and the kid gets the
93:10 place alright we need the real life and
93:17 real education and real information to
93:19 be as open and free and as I would say
93:26 without penalty to be discussed as that
93:30 kid was able to explore that factory the
93:34 factory said you know you're gonna live
93:37 in a world of pure imagination okay
93:40 great
93:42 I would say the amount of science that
93:45 we have told ourselves that we
93:46 understand with great penalty if you
93:50 were to refute Neil deGrasse Tyson or
93:52 the science guy right it's it's an
93:56 ultimate penalty and Scarlet Letter
94:00 that'll get wrapped around you if you so
94:03 much as say the Big Bang didn't exist
94:04 global warming's fake all these
94:07 different things because it's against
94:08 some other control agenda right a lot of
94:12 us sit around thinking about okay
94:15 science is kind of screwed up science is
94:18 now a science with the capital S it is
94:22 the new religion for those that don't
94:25 know science they retreat back to folk
94:28 tales of people that never existed to be
94:32 controlled for those that are out of
94:34 that makes they go right into capital as
94:36 science the new religion you controlled
94:40 in both paradigms we think about well
94:43 geez how do we take these guys down hmm
94:47 well I would say this let's go with a
94:50 Kubrick analogy at the end here so I
94:53 closed this baby off 2001 a Space
94:56 Odyssey act 1 it must have been really
95:00 interesting in 1969 to be told that
95:04 you're going to the most scientific
95:07 movie that's ever been made and it's so
95:12 long it has an intermission in the
95:13 middle of the film today they wouldn't
95:16 do that because we make plenty of films
95:17 that are that long but you sit down in
95:21 the theater you got your popcorn and
95:23 your soda whatever and the lights fade
95:25 and what do you see monkeys prehistoric
95:30 man now wait a minute aren't we seeing a
95:33 science fiction movie I mean most of us
95:35 know how the movie goes now so we watch
95:37 it and we know any problem with it right
95:38 by the way I still have friends of mine
95:41 or grown adults that can't get through
95:42 that movie so sad but the initial act
95:46 one is about a group of monkeys that
95:48 have a water spot that they used to
95:50 drink every day because you got to have
95:53 water and another tribe of monkeys comes
95:55 up over the hill
95:56 and fights them but they don't fight
96:01 physically they just sort of scare each
96:03 other they wave at each other and get
96:05 away get away this one's mine right and
96:07 there's there's more alpha males on the
96:10 other tribe and so the initial tribe
96:12 gets pushed away within this thing
96:16 called the monolith shows up this black
96:18 beautiful monolith and it freaks out the
96:21 the first tribe right and the second
96:23 tribe has no idea this thing arrived
96:25 right and its purpose is to imbue man
96:27 with programming to change our paradigm
96:30 of thinking and even though this is
96:33 going to be a sort of a violent analogy
96:34 it's sort of the tenacity and the
96:39 velocity of which we have to change our
96:41 own minds and it has to be well I think
96:44 we're at a point now with the Great
96:45 Awakening that we can't achieve this
96:48 gigantic bump and the way that we think
96:52 and then we would communicate with each
96:53 other especially about science but the
96:57 monolith told this tribe told the leader
97:01 who had just I don't know finished eatin
97:05 berries or whatever and he's sitting
97:06 there looking at the carcass of this
97:07 bore thing that had died and so it's
97:11 just this bunch of ribcage bones and he
97:15 grabs on with the bones and he's just
97:16 playing around he's just starting to hit
97:18 one and hit the other one he's starting
97:20 to realize oh wow this thing this tool
97:23 for the homo sapien sapien that's about
97:26 to come out of this creature it's all
97:29 fictitious but you know it's an analogy
97:30 it's a metaphor it's beautiful I starts
97:33 hitting this thing and realizing he can
97:34 break the other bones with this other
97:36 bone because it's bigger so then he
97:40 kills the boar rips it apart and starts
97:44 eating meat and sorry for all your
97:48 vegetarians out there the meat makes the
97:51 brain bigger makes the visual cortex
97:53 bigger we metabolize and re combine
97:57 protein patterns from the original
97:59 primitive protein patterns that they
98:01 went into the boar and that we're also
98:02 recombined and then we eat that boar
98:04 it's more complex protein patterns we
98:07 make even more Pro complex protein
98:09 patterns and we
98:09 become who we are right that's why us
98:13 eating grass doesn't work okay this
98:18 makes us docile and sick but he goes
98:22 back to the waterhole having taught all
98:24 his buddies about the bone trick
98:28 they've all been eating meat so they
98:31 have more energy their eyes work better
98:33 their brains work better they're faster
98:36 they're smart they're dominant that dude
98:40 tries who tries to wave him off at the
98:42 waterhole the other alpha male and our
98:45 alpha male beats him on the side of the
98:47 head knocks him out and then he beats
98:51 him and beats him and beats him in front
98:53 of the other tribe caving in his head
98:56 and the other tribe leaves and they got
99:00 the water hole and that alpha male takes
99:02 that bone he's so [ __ ] happy throws
99:04 that damn thing in the sky and then the
99:07 bones twirling in space right and then
99:10 poof it's a spaceship and we're at the
99:14 next stage of the monolith which is now
99:16 on the moon I think that through our
99:19 communication in productions like this
99:22 and the millions of others that are on
99:24 YouTube that are way better than this
99:26 show and your own personal intellect
99:29 there's a lot of you out there that have
99:31 ideas that are dead-on you know the next
99:34 stage of something it's important that
99:37 you share it it's important I think you
99:39 share it with your closest friends that
99:41 are gonna be apt to listen to you with
99:43 the academic background to understand
99:45 where you're going and hey maybe your
99:47 first five versions of the conversation
99:50 aren't so good just keep refining your
99:54 story like I do until you can say it in
99:57 less words try to find physical
99:59 analogies right when I first follow the
100:04 bubble in water to show the mathematical
100:07 congruence between ether and the planet
100:09 Earth and all bodies in space and how
100:13 this force works right in front of our
100:16 face it's been in front of our face the
100:17 entire time bubbles have always existed
100:20 since man has been sentient right
100:22 well it took I took a person I think it
100:26 was bart sibrel when I was in the
100:27 interview with him I think he mentioned
100:29 bubbles to me and he wasn't talking
100:31 about ether but he mentioned bubbles to
100:33 me and I just I just was like poof it
100:35 all came together the other analogy of
100:37 how the system works right so anyway I
100:42 think you feel me this is a very
100:44 esoteric episode but I think the chain
100:46 of thought flows I really really really
100:50 want to pass on the inspiration that I
100:52 have found personally through other
100:54 people that existed before I ever made
100:57 this show and then the feedback loop I'm
100:59 getting from you guys I want to push
101:01 that energy back out to you on a
101:04 constant basis right inspiring you guys
101:07 to bring me your ideas too you don't
101:09 need to bring it to me really but bring
101:11 it to the world right look up zero-point
101:16 energy systems there's a plenty of you
101:18 with resources you've got little
101:20 workshops that you wish you had a
101:22 project you're pretty good with
101:24 electronics or what have you go look
101:26 them up go look up Stan Myers the dude
101:29 that was assassinated in 1993 for
101:31 figuring out how to turn tap water into
101:32 pure hydrogen on demand something they
101:36 say it can't be done cuz waters to tap
101:38 waters to impure to do it well that's
101:40 [ __ ] he did it you can go find his
101:43 schematics and build that engine just
101:45 don't go raising money because they'll
101:47 kill you right just do it in secret once
101:50 you figure out how to do it like he did
101:52 it it's a very complex thing to do but
101:55 if you have that aptitude you should do
101:58 it and then publish it to the world
102:01 here's how you do it my name is
102:04 so-and-so this is how you do it don't
102:07 try to make a buck like I said in the
102:09 previous episode a long time ago trust
102:11 me if you're responsible for solving the
102:14 energy problem of the world and knocking
102:16 these oil companies straight out of
102:17 Compton right you'll never pay for
102:21 anything again
102:22 right you could walk up to a gas station
102:24 go I'm the guy that you know turning
102:28 this place into a water station is
102:30 someone else give me some water I can I
102:32 get a can I get a meal for free how
102:34 about a suit
102:35 ticket to Tahiti and people are gonna go
102:39 no problem dude there you go
102:41 can I take a picture with you well I'm
102:43 not sure pal you're set for life don't
102:47 even worry about it
102:48 Tesla gave us his whole stash for free
102:52 not because he wanted to but because he
102:54 was screwed but he said can you just
102:58 make the AC motor the standard form of
103:01 electricity in this planet I said sure
103:04 right all the way to the bank well he
103:08 died penniless right you don't have to
103:11 go out that way you don't have to give
103:13 it to a billionaire to monopolize it on
103:16 everybody make it such that we can build
103:19 it out of Tupperware and tinfoil and a
103:22 couple rubber bands and toothpicks let's
103:25 go MacGyver on this thing anyway I think
103:28 that's all I got tonight had to pound
103:30 this one out cuz it's just too cold out
103:32 there if you haven't been to deep
103:35 thoughts radio.com
103:36 please go it's just where you pick up
103:38 all the feeds again if you found me on
103:40 video and you'd like it in your car and
103:41 audio that feeds up there if you want to
103:43 reverse back to a video that's up there
103:46 there's a locked Facebook group we have
103:49 a lot of fun on that group again it's a
103:52 lot of funny stuff fun stuff yes there
103:55 are theories that you don't believe up
103:56 there but what's nice is again I'll put
104:00 it to you this way our Facebook group is
104:02 a bit like that willy wonka factory it's
104:04 an informal institution of open thought
104:07 so yeah you're gonna hear things that
104:09 again you think are completely stupid
104:11 but that's the fun part about it right
104:14 right you I'm sure you wouldn't like all
104:16 the candy and Willy Wonka's chocolate
104:17 factory either but the stuff you do like
104:19 is gonna be really delicious right
104:21 there's also a patreon group we've had a
104:24 lot of fat of action up there again the
104:27 thing about patreon is if you join for a
104:28 buck you get all these episodes usually
104:31 before everyone else does the only time
104:34 I don't hold it back is really late at
104:37 night on a Saturday or Sunday when I'm
104:39 trying to push out a doubleheader like
104:41 this one might actually get out there
104:43 before the doubleheader needs to debut
104:46 so you might get this one but I just
104:47 finished one at home that's rendering
104:49 the
104:49 they'll get early so as soon as you join
104:52 the fee goes from nothing to a ton of
104:55 things that you'll see
104:56 so anyway take care of yourself and
104:59 someone else and I'll see you in the
105:00 next deep thoughts over now
105:02 [Music]
105:14 you
