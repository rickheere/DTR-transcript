00:00 [Music]
00:33 ladies and gentlemen and welcome back to
00:36 deep thoughts I think it's time for this
00:39 video how does the world get to a place
00:42 where we want to change the world I'm
00:46 not in a super fun fuzzy kind of
00:48 Disneyland way oh man let's just
00:51 everything's going great let's just
00:52 create some more greatness yeah I'm
00:56 asking you when wake up and find us
01:00 ourselves some shackles physically
01:04 mentally spiritually and when we wake up
01:08 and find out that our food supply was
01:10 swapped with a genetically modified gene
01:12 terminating methodology and nobody's
01:17 sent you a memo saying is that okay if
01:19 we do this and - hey it has some health
01:21 problems and it contains glyphosate
01:25 because it takes a little while to
01:28 gather medical data and you have to be
01:31 in certain communities to get that
01:32 medical data you have no idea that
01:35 cancer barely ever existed you know 150
01:37 years ago that they tell you that you
01:40 know the average lifespan of someone you
01:42 know a thousand years ago was 35 years
01:44 old but all the mummies we find in Egypt
01:48 are average age between 75 and 90 and
01:53 they have all their teeth
01:56 so how does it get that way is it
01:59 because all the people that we trusted
02:01 had their [ __ ] together I'm gonna
02:05 suggest not
02:08 I'm going to suggest that we in order to
02:11 create this situation we create false
02:13 paradigms of certification right we say
02:18 that person's got degree that person's
02:20 done this thing and therefore they know
02:23 everything and don't question bruce
02:27 lipton as I mentioned in that episode
02:30 brilliant guy
02:31 brilliant guy what did he do he thought
02:35 out of the box what did he do when he
02:38 was taught something in class he took it
02:41 into the laboratory to prove that it was
02:43 true and lo and behold what did he find
02:48 they're full of [ __ ] that's what he
02:50 found completely misunderstanding the
02:55 human cell you don't you think that's a
02:57 little big right the dogma theory is
02:59 truly dogma ok so that's that's gonna be
03:03 the left column of this conversation we
03:07 let the world become [ __ ] because we get
03:11 lazy right we don't become the experts
03:14 we allow other people to become experts
03:15 which means we become dumber than [ __ ]
03:17 and you will find in your life the most
03:21 common people that tell you that someone
03:23 else is smart it's not always the case
03:26 that if you get it if you have the
03:27 exception to this rule you live a good
03:29 life but the most common people that
03:31 will tell you the son was a genius are
03:32 complete idiots they don't know but
03:36 they'll tell their friends
03:39 the person being labeled perhaps eats it
03:42 up yeah again I said a few episodes back
03:46 in my NASA episode you know I've had
03:49 relatives in mind that that wanted to be
03:51 right in a conversation and they
03:53 mentioned a friend who worked for NASA
03:54 we have no idea what the position of
03:57 this person is whether they empty the
03:59 trash or calculate aerospace orbital
04:02 algorithms or what-have-you but the way
04:06 the person tried to win the argument was
04:07 well this person works for NASA okay
04:12 I think NASA's number one product is
04:16 deceit and we've proven it
04:21 very clever but now let's go to the
04:24 right column slightly more positive than
04:26 the left column that columns all about
04:28 the negative and we let the world kind
04:30 of get screwed up let's go to the right
04:32 column
04:32 it's totally positive how do inventors
04:36 invent things
04:37 how do philosophers create more
04:41 dimension for us to analyze the world
04:43 with all right our philosophy more
04:47 analogy
04:48 maybe it's poetry how does a new form of
04:53 music come about right how does that
04:56 happen
04:58 in some cases it's an evolutionary
05:01 evolvement that is very logical right
05:04 the blue is turning into rock and roll
05:06 well that's pretty logical to be honest
05:09 you're turning into the Beatles well
05:12 maybe maybe that's a little more
05:16 revolutionary you're turning into Prince
05:19 I don't know maybe that's that's even
05:23 evolutionary but these people all of
05:27 them they do what cliche is they thought
05:31 out of the box
05:32 I would agree they thought out of the
05:37 box
05:40 and therefore the world got better now
05:44 that could mean a lot of things
05:46 sometimes it would mean leaving the
05:48 township leaving the borders of which
05:50 you define as the city the town that you
05:53 live in and there's never been a soul
05:55 that's ever wanted to go outside of
05:57 those borders and this person just
05:59 simply goes you know what I'm a
06:01 millionaire heart I feel like there's
06:04 something over that elephone elephant
06:06 bone graveyard I'm gonna go check it out
06:10 she's gonna take her boyfriend Daniel
06:12 Boone and they're just gonna find stuff
06:17 we're gonna find out what an ocean is
06:20 because they can't even see one meaning
06:22 they can't conceive of one they've never
06:25 seen a waterfall
06:26 maybe they never even seen a lake they
06:27 got a pond but they don't have a lake
06:29 you don't talking about they're gonna
06:31 find people different races then that
06:34 might seem like a silly analogy but the
06:36 idea is this there are a lot of people
06:39 out there that are terrified of the
06:41 world they just are they're cowards they
06:45 may not be cowards because they you know
06:48 had the choice of being strong and chose
06:50 to be weak I mean that's really
06:52 technically what's going on with them
06:54 but no one ever pressured them to live
06:58 and so they stayed [ __ ] in their age
07:02 maturity they didn't grow they're you
07:06 know going on 50 but they're 12 I've
07:10 seen this happen man then there's the
07:14 mutts you know you have you have these
07:15 kids that get to grow up in these
07:17 beautiful houses with great parents
07:19 everything is taken care of man they
07:21 don't even have to make their bed that
07:23 you know yeah like every meal made for
07:25 them the laundry gets made maybe they
07:28 find a spouse that they marry and that
07:30 spouse takes care of everything mommy
07:31 and daddy used to take care of did you
07:34 never have to grow up they don't
07:35 understand to their core why everyone
07:38 else is growing up what are you doing
07:40 this doesn't someone take care of this
07:43 [Music]
07:44 and then you have the folks that barely
07:47 have any parents that doesn't mean
07:49 they're beating up their kids it just
07:51 means like my parents weren't really
07:52 present when I was
07:54 I kind of loved it I mean I kind of
07:56 totally loved it so I got the chance to
08:00 do a lot of stuff and they were really
08:02 good about tasking me with things and so
08:04 you know if they found me with a
08:08 favorite family with the silver spoon in
08:10 my mouth they would pull it out and sell
08:14 it but you grow fast when you gotta do
08:18 stuff for yourself and there's people
08:19 that have grown up so fast it's amazing
08:22 they grew up in fact some of people grow
08:24 up too far you know they have to be in
08:27 really bad batteries at the world and
08:30 injure things that we don't have to
08:31 endure in the first world the point of
08:34 this episode is going to be the
08:35 following we have to understand as human
08:41 beings but if we're ever to understand
08:46 the world and all of its dimension just
08:50 like my tunnel of knowledge episode
08:53 alludes to you know the tunnel of
08:56 knowledge episode is about your personal
08:57 journey and viewing education as a
08:59 destination versus a journey a tunnel
09:02 that you never stop traveling through
09:03 right I don't know anyone that just sits
09:06 in a tunnel so those are things you have
09:08 to come out of but now but when we view
09:10 the rest of the world
09:13 are we tunneling or allowing the other
09:16 people to be on a journey this but that
09:17 way you stop using over there the word
09:19 or do we want them to be at some
09:21 destination I come from a small town as
09:25 I always say and one thing happens in a
09:28 small town with doctors of all kinds my
09:31 uncle was an optometrist he graduated in
09:34 the top three of his class here in Los
09:35 Angeles back home to practice he could
09:40 have gotten a certification in state of
09:43 Kansas and I believe keep that for a
09:46 tremendous number of years he worked for
09:48 for decades before he retired he did not
09:53 have to go off and continue his
09:54 education to remain in the job but he
09:58 was just that kind of guy just runs in
10:00 my family
10:01 she might assume and so at least once a
10:05 year he went to huge conferences where
10:09 he would learn the state of the art it
10:13 was a radial keratotomy was the first
10:15 way that we fix ties very complicated
10:18 dangerous process I guess its effects
10:20 are a lot better than the techniques we
10:22 used today but I I don't have any
10:25 contact with him on a daily basis to
10:27 verify that nowadays but he said he
10:31 stayed educated so something could come
10:32 in to my uncle's office and if they knew
10:38 which I don't think anyone really knew
10:39 that he was doing this but if they knew
10:41 they could say dr. Lowe he stays
10:47 educated he reads medical journals every
10:49 single day he stays up on things by
10:53 going and talking to confer conferences
10:55 learning from other folks he surrounds
10:58 himself with all the eye surgeons that
11:01 he went to school with and so they sit
11:03 and they talk and they pass along
11:05 information so he has the latest and
11:07 greatest technology in his mind all the
11:09 time
11:10 did I guarantee you somewhere in my town
11:12 there's a primary care physician at the
11:17 hospital he probably completed 40 years
11:20 of his or her career without ever going
11:23 to any course that wasn't mandated to
11:26 keep their medical license meaning they
11:28 did the bare minimum to stay employed
11:29 his babies come out of vagina it's the
11:32 same exact way every single day they
11:35 learn one way to take out the the
11:40 gallbladder or the appendix and there's
11:43 no other need to study that you know the
11:46 big six inch scar and the belly of the
11:48 person is just going to have to be six
11:51 inches in this town because they won't
11:53 go and learn the
11:54 microscopic way of getting it out with a
11:56 couple you know centimeter cuts
12:00 I would say it's something to the order
12:02 of atrophy right and you don't use a
12:07 muscle atrophies right it becomes
12:10 useless I think that even though these
12:15 wonderful people scientists at some
12:19 point doctors at some point maybe both
12:21 scientists and doctors
12:22 we're very up-to-date at one point and
12:25 really contributed to society and helped
12:27 kids get into science or whatever or
12:29 they heal people they obviously know how
12:32 to do certain finite things that will
12:36 save your life and that's an awesome
12:38 amazing thing not everyone has to be on
12:41 a journey for sure in fact probably the
12:44 majority of the world at this stage is
12:48 not on any type of journey whatsoever in
12:50 the in the kind of baby boomer older
12:54 genex realm my generation right but when
12:59 we find someone who was actually on that
13:00 journey we should be excited that
13:04 they're on that journey that they're out
13:06 there exploring different things that
13:07 they're using in a lot of cases what's
13:12 going on is that doctors are going
13:14 backwards they're finding out that we
13:17 were a lot healthier back in the past
13:21 anthropological studies prove it on
13:24 bones over a particular age we have to
13:26 figure out how they got to 86 and 90 and
13:29 had all their teeth right what are you
13:31 taught today if you don't brush with
13:33 fluoride rotting your pine oil gland
13:36 rotting the enamel in your teeth god
13:39 knows what else you're [ __ ] doing to
13:41 yourself they tell you that you're gonna
13:43 lose your teeth are just gonna magically
13:44 fall out because you ate food again our
13:47 teeth are probably one of the most
13:49 distinct things we have between us as
13:51 human beings there are families with
13:53 very small teeth families with giant
13:55 teeth like my family some people is
13:58 extremely thick enamel like my family
14:00 and people with almost none some people
14:03 are born I will work with a woman who
14:05 made no joke about it she said everyone
14:07 but me as dentures in my family's grows
14:09 29 years old they're just born with you
14:12 know very fragile teeth and they
14:14 luzhin wall this is what happens but
14:17 these doctors and these scientists are
14:19 on a mission and the cool thing is is
14:23 that they're out there studying
14:24 everything without a bias right what
14:28 would happen to someone who grew up in
14:31 Massachusetts right next to Harvard
14:32 Medical and they just revered the place
14:36 right there's no reason not to review
14:38 the place in one realm or another so
14:41 it's an institution of amazing knowledge
14:43 right let's just say they worshiped the
14:46 sign the place perhaps their family went
14:49 there or whatever you know kids just get
14:51 strung out on things there's some kid in
14:53 Spain that was strung out on North Korea
14:55 for God's sakes bizarre is that at the
14:57 age of 12 you wanted to live in North
14:59 Korea now I'm actually willing to do I'm
15:03 willing to assume that the Harvard
15:04 Medical is actually a place that
15:05 actually does a lot of exploration into
15:08 what works and what doesn't work so
15:09 perhaps I picked the wrong University
15:11 let's just say the kid goes in there and
15:14 it doesn't want to know anything that
15:16 Harvard does not teach again orbits
15:20 probably the top medical schools in the
15:22 world but say the kid goes through finds
15:28 out that you know he's gives P H DS he's
15:31 gonna go into his primary care practice
15:32 did his internship it's all good but a
15:36 girl who went through the same school
15:38 after she graduated she went to say the
15:42 Asian Pacific Rim maybe she went to
15:44 India maybe she went to Asia deep inland
15:48 Asia and discovered some things
15:52 discovered some things that aren't
15:54 taught at Harvard Medical perhaps
15:57 pharmaceutical things she figured out
15:59 you know various herbs that you can
16:03 crush up and eat maybe she just went to
16:08 a place with no radio waves no cellular
16:13 telephones cell phones lost earlier
16:14 towers no cable television
16:17 [Music]
16:20 and she discovered that everyone's
16:22 healthy and so now they meet and they're
16:30 gonna try to have a conversation about
16:31 this and initially they have respect for
16:33 each other because they went through the
16:35 eye of the needle which is medical
16:37 school together and they both graduated
16:41 and she's gonna be trying to tell him
16:43 this stuff and what's that kid gonna do
16:48 he's all Ivy League and he wanted to be
16:51 Ivy League when he was 10 years old it's
16:56 all about the institution for him now
16:59 perhaps it's you know 20 years after
17:02 they started medical school I started 18
17:03 years old and now they're 38 years old
17:05 they've both been out for roughly 10
17:07 years haven't seen each other since so
17:12 this guy is well into his tenure perhaps
17:15 he's a professor and she's an actual
17:16 doctor
17:19 and she's trying to tell him even
17:23 remember when we were in school and we
17:25 were very idealistic and we said that we
17:27 were gonna cure cancer and he goes yeah
17:29 I remember that how naive are we and she
17:33 says you know I figured it out I've been
17:36 traveling for last 10 years in
17:38 communities in whatever area and there's
17:41 no cancer there's not a hell of a lot of
17:44 people but there's no cancer and he's
17:48 like well hahaha well that obviously
17:50 can't be true and let's just say she has
17:54 her computer with her a little tablet or
17:57 whatever telephone just starts pulling
18:00 up the proof starts explaining the fact
18:04 that they don't have certain things and
18:05 they have other things this is a more
18:07 simple life but in this region of the
18:11 world they also have scientists and
18:13 doctors they have technical amenities
18:16 they just don't overdo it and now that
18:20 guy has a choice in his brain perhaps he
18:23 has a genetic limiter as to whether
18:25 night is gonna be able to listen to her
18:27 haven't you ever thought that while
18:31 you're thinking it hurts
18:33 and the more that you think this is a
18:37 medical fact you get tired and when you
18:41 get tired your brain will obviously talk
18:45 you into things this is what's very
18:47 interesting about the human mind right
18:50 I have had to push through barriers in
18:53 my life where I need to learn something
18:55 really complicated and I mean really
18:58 complicated right
19:01 now look at something on my computer or
19:04 look at something on a piece of paper
19:05 the answer is going to be explained to
19:07 me it is not going to be a cheat sheet
19:09 one page thing I'm gonna have to read
19:11 perhaps fifty to fifteen hundred pages
19:15 right when I showed you that Stephen
19:18 Wolfram book about the name of it is
19:20 it's must be two thousand pages long I
19:24 was involved in a film writing project
19:27 and I had to read that book it's very
19:34 repetitive but God everyone else was
19:36 reading it and so if I showed up and I
19:38 didn't read a hundred pages of it trying
19:40 to cheat and there just happens to be
19:42 the golden ticket and those hundred
19:44 pages I'm gonna look like an idiot and
19:46 they won't trust the rest of my ability
19:48 to read but I've looked at things and
19:52 it's it's like the hosts in West world
19:56 it doesn't look it look like anything to
19:58 me you get that feeling and your brain
20:00 almost starts saying stop paying
20:01 attention stop that's hurting you don't
20:03 you want to go to sleep
20:04 maybe you just completed a 12-hour nap
20:07 you know and they'll still put your head
20:08 back to bed what I find is this and
20:12 begin coming from the Midwest I get this
20:15 in crystal-clear vision when I see
20:22 someone who's enjoying the Midwest and
20:24 they should then join my hometown they
20:26 found a place to live they got their
20:30 kids in school they got a good job they
20:32 make enough right maybe they had some
20:36 money handed down from their family
20:37 maybe they just make enough money and
20:40 I'll roll into town and just have a
20:44 conversation and maybe they know they
20:45 know me and they're like hey dude you
20:47 went to California right yeah totally
20:49 yeah well what do you do out there Dana
20:51 I'll bounce through a couple subjects
20:52 you know try to keep the conversation
20:54 pretty simple
20:58 and most people are SuperDuper happy and
21:00 thrilled for you and that kind of thing
21:01 and I'm always done on my look I wish I
21:03 had your gig but some people go into
21:06 hater mode very very rare I'm just gonna
21:09 tell you right now it's very rare but
21:11 some people go into heater mode it's
21:12 almost a passive-aggressive hater mode I
21:15 sometimes it'll make some good points
21:17 right they'll talk about the freaks in
21:18 Hollywood
21:20 and they're right there completely right
21:23 sometimes they'll pick some of our
21:25 greater attributes and try to take a
21:29 crap on them and it's just because
21:32 they're afraid they're afraid that
21:35 probably they might like it but they
21:38 just don't have the courage to you know
21:42 live in such a busy world and you know I
21:44 don't blame anyone who doesn't want to
21:45 drive in Southern California traffic I
21:48 can't even imagine some people living in
21:51 these tiny towns the 2500 people will
21:52 come into the mid what are coming to the
21:54 coast and trying to live in you know a
21:57 town with 20 million people the best of
22:00 the best have car wrecks in LA you know
22:04 good to know what I'm talking about the
22:06 people that are very comfortable in
22:07 their world and they're not to be
22:08 criticized necessarily we have to
22:11 understand them more than they have to
22:13 understand us but just in case we net
22:17 one of these people and you're still
22:19 listening to this episode please
22:21 consider the following when you have
22:25 someone that is certified by the
22:27 establishment which again has brought us
22:29 horrible schools crappy colleges your
22:33 kids going again they spending we're
22:34 from 75 to 150 thousand dollars on a
22:37 degree and they're unemployable how do
22:39 you think that's happening it's because
22:41 the people that run the college have
22:44 never been in the real world one time
22:45 and now there's some of us on the
22:48 outside who have done everything they
22:51 ever wanted to do roughly and we're
22:53 trying to tell you you know maybe going
22:57 to that school to learn that thing isn't
23:00 worth it at all our president just
23:02 recently talked about making vocational
23:04 schools again and vocational schools are
23:08 schools where you don't go to learn
23:10 philosophy you've learnt you learn to
23:13 fix a jet engine a car engine you learn
23:17 how to build a house really awesome meat
23:21 potatoes kind of jobs where at the end
23:22 of the day your level of job
23:24 satisfaction is off the chart okay and
23:28 you get a 365 days out of the year
23:31 bodywork maybe garment creation or
23:34 whatever those are the jobs in my
23:37 lifetime have been the most thrilling
23:39 for the people that have them I think as
23:42 a healthy society we would want people
23:44 to be sort of the scout's of information
23:48 and possibility but we don't have
23:52 anything like that at all right and then
23:55 we give you a kind of kooky analogy that
23:57 might relate to like a game of Thrones
23:59 kind of world if you had a fortress city
24:04 with big tall walls and you got all your
24:07 citizens inside you have a king or queen
24:11 that runs the city let's go with a queen
24:15 because that's where that shows mostly
24:17 configured they want to know they're
24:21 protected right that's where the Scout
24:24 comes in it's a group of individuals
24:28 usually whose job is to do a patrol
24:32 around the surrounding lands of this
24:35 kingdom to make sure there's no threats
24:38 to kind of keep a tab on things right I
24:40 mean a if a new army is coming you got a
24:43 you got to know where when what's the
24:45 count
24:46 what's their military aptitude do they
24:48 have trigger Shea's are they able to
24:50 scale walls or they're just a bunch of
24:53 caveman with rocks are they one caveman
24:58 with rocks are they 10,000 kV with rocks
25:01 are the animals that could just simply
25:03 crawl up the wall our control right if
25:06 we had everything inside our little fort
25:09 restof areas in our lives completely
25:11 perfect and you're immune from cancer
25:13 and we're immune from all the ailments
25:15 of the world no one is dying around us
25:18 of weird ways and maybe we could live in
25:21 a bubble keep our head in the sand
25:24 and that goes on a you know microcosm of
25:27 your house basically right and your job
25:29 perhaps when you zoom in up to a town a
25:34 state and a country and now you're
25:38 living in a global community and you
25:39 have threats that you're gonna have to
25:41 assess there should be someone in our
25:45 community every community hopefully that
25:50 is sort of pushing the barrier and we're
25:52 sort of happy that they're pushing that
25:54 barrier and I'm not talking about you
25:57 know swingers and all that crap I'm
26:00 talking about science and philosophy and
26:02 education if there is a new industry
26:06 coming it'd be nice to make sure that
26:10 the citizens of our town can engage in
26:12 that industry right and it's getting the
26:16 windiest [ __ ] around my town was like
26:23 this okay my town actually always had
26:25 someone extremely technical in it lots
26:28 of people that were technical like I
26:29 think I mentioned in my episodes got
26:31 anybody Ross he just recently passed
26:34 away he invented custom electronics with
26:37 the Kay I think 50% of the radar guns
26:42 that catch you speeding in the world are
26:44 custom electronic guns I came out here
26:47 and by 19 1987 end of the year Oh 88 the
26:53 end of the year I got pulled over for
26:55 doing something 70 in a 50 and I went up
27:00 to the cop car and there's the custom
27:01 electronics made in my hometown of bf
27:05 Egypt gun right in his dashboard I just
27:08 got caught by my own stuff right
27:12 we had people that made the first home
27:15 satellite dishes the bird view brands
27:18 which then turn in this other Eagle
27:20 brand with someone left bird view and
27:23 reverse engineered it down the street
27:25 mph was the other radar gun company that
27:28 reverse engineered the custom
27:30 electronics gun just as I was leaving my
27:34 hometown 87 my old my grandfather's old
27:38 Dodge dealership Dodge Chrysler
27:40 dealership was turned into a company
27:43 that made wireless microphones they're
27:44 the ones with a little box on the bottom
27:46 remember those in the 90s made the crap
27:50 out of those things so in my hometown I
27:54 was always surrounded by innovators that
27:56 we're talking about dad I mean nine
28:00 thousand people when I left probably ten
28:02 thousand somewhere in there again the
28:05 kid that brought me to California his
28:06 father invented the corrugated handles
28:09 the world of cardboard handles on
28:11 shopping bags which we see every day now
28:14 it's no big deal he invented it he did
28:17 it out here and then he brought his
28:18 company to my hometown literally was in
28:20 a garden grove which is one a couple
28:22 towns over he brought it to my little
28:24 town in Kansas to manufacture his wife
28:27 was from Tennessee anyway so I
28:29 constantly was seeing someone innovating
28:32 and usually all towns have something
28:34 like this usually but not everyone
28:38 notices and when they don't notice this
28:44 they tend to go in those people that
28:46 will over qualify individuals that
28:49 haven't had an educational update and
28:51 perhaps two or three decades and it
28:54 creates a lot of problems for society
28:56 why are people that are doctrine ated
28:59 into various religions so well there's
29:02 either one or two
29:03 the smaller group is the super acidic
29:06 group and the larger group is the you
29:09 know this is what I believe and you know
29:10 you're welcome to believe whatever you
29:11 believe and I understand because I'm
29:13 mature adult there's differences between
29:15 us like I always say you can go to any
29:18 church in the world that comes to church
29:20 every Sunday and everyone sits in the
29:23 exact same order all the
29:24 and you can go what do you believe about
29:27 Genesis what do you believe about letter
29:30 to refer in thien's it talks about the
29:32 women sit down shut up shutting up and
29:34 talking to their husbands before they
29:35 talk what do you think about this and
29:36 they're all different do you really
29:41 think you know Moses brought down the
29:43 Ten Commandments do you believe it
29:44 deeply and you'll find your differences
29:46 so where there's perceived unification
29:49 there isn't but somehow they can sit
29:53 next to each other all day long but
29:56 there's that tiniest city group that is
29:59 truly terrified of the rest of the world
30:03 they haven't been anywhere you know
30:05 coming from the state of Kansas in
30:06 America the the one thing that I think
30:10 they're gone out I forgot what the hell
30:12 their name is but there was that
30:15 Christian sect I hate to even say
30:17 Christian okay because that insults
30:19 pretty much everyone else in the world
30:20 he believes in that particularly
30:21 religion but this group would it was run
30:26 by some inbred family I swear to God
30:28 everybody was just in this their family
30:31 tree just went straight up and no
30:32 branches but they they would show up to
30:37 like you know soldiers you know they
30:40 bring soldiers back from war and they're
30:42 in their caskets and they would held up
30:44 signs saying how they deserved it they
30:47 were very homophobic they were just the
30:50 worst human being there's like four of
30:52 them I mean seriously speaking there's
30:53 like four of them it might build in
30:55 doctoring another ten from their
30:57 communities Topeka Kansas is worthy word
30:59 believe me Topeka Kansas is not like
31:02 this okay but this one weird family made
31:06 the entire town and I think the state
31:09 look horrible I haven't seen him in like
31:11 a decade thank God you know it's it's
31:15 that spin-off family from the kid had
31:18 played the Dueling banjo and deliverance
31:24 but they would get on TV and they would
31:26 talk in a second that they tried to
31:28 speak English you realized within
31:30 seconds these people don't have two
31:33 brain cells to rub together I mean they
31:36 must have the minimum amount of neural
31:39 pathways in their brain simply to keep
31:41 their body functioning and that's about
31:42 it and that drastic case is very
31:46 interesting because we can all kind of
31:47 look at that go well yeah but that's
31:49 that one kind of family that's not us
31:51 okay I agree you're way smarter than
31:55 that way smarter that's hard not to be
31:58 but is there anything like that that
32:00 we're doing right and I'm not
32:03 holier-than-thou right I'm pretty
32:07 open-minded but I'm sure there's
32:09 something that I haven't thought about
32:11 yet when I think about this subject
32:12 matter or I'm sort of like well you know
32:15 it's like this and I'm wrong whatever
32:19 reason I think I've had enough
32:20 information in particular or it could be
32:22 weird little areas where I never even
32:24 never visited more than once in my mind
32:27 and therefore I've got a really juvenile
32:30 take on it we want people in our society
32:33 to explore and we should be excited but
32:38 now here is how you deal with someone
32:41 who's on a journey like that because
32:43 it's not if you don't put a little
32:45 thought behind it most of you core
32:48 listeners you know this you're one of
32:50 these people so believe me I'm just sort
32:53 of preaching around us right when I say
32:57 the word preach I always think of the
33:00 passage in deadwood the series on HBO
33:03 where the sheriff turns to the
33:08 the preacher in the town and he says you
33:10 know it's a little early to be preached
33:12 at you know I've had a hard night you
33:15 just buried a body and the guy said
33:18 something to the effect of well if I'm
33:20 preaching at you than I am failing I'm
33:24 just preaching to the heavens and you
33:30 just happen to be an earshot meaning I'm
33:32 not trying to ridicule you personally
33:34 I'm just simply saying what I believe to
33:37 be true to the outside world now some of
33:41 you will have friends that have gone off
33:46 on perhaps a particular conspiracy of
33:50 some sort
33:51 the easiest method the easiest version
33:55 of this excuse me is when they go off on
33:57 something you've already gone off on
33:59 maybe you did the Flat Earth thing that
34:02 you came back to heliocentric for some
34:04 reason so neither one of them are right
34:06 or wrong just give an example but they
34:09 go down that path and here you can just
34:11 see them getting the same information
34:13 you got and they're now convinced that
34:15 perhaps it is flat and just you can see
34:17 they're saying the words that you said
34:19 at those exact moments they're
34:21 recreating your path that you've already
34:22 been done but you know in the back your
34:25 head there's a chance that they simply
34:29 become satisfied with that theory and
34:30 they no longer research expanding earth
34:33 right which may sway them back so at
34:40 that point we've picked up our gear of
34:43 knowledge you know this location that
34:45 we're at and we move to a new location
34:47 we simply put it all down and stake it
34:49 out again so we were dynamic for that
34:51 journey but then we became not so
34:55 dynamic down the street we've done this
34:58 all the way through history right isn't
35:01 it funny that when we're young we're not
35:02 quite sure what music would be like but
35:05 a lot of folks will hang on to their
35:07 teenage years of music they only like
35:11 the music that was made before they were
35:13 say 25 years old they cannot listen to
35:16 anything they just can't when someone
35:19 goes on a journey you've been on it's
35:21 very comforting
35:22 to you because you can see the full
35:23 ecosystem you know you can see the path
35:25 they're on but what if your kid or your
35:27 spouse or your relative or your friend
35:31 goes down a path that you've never been
35:33 down and when they come back to report
35:36 things maybe they're not the best
35:38 explainers you know and so now you're
35:41 kind of like whoa that's pretty kooky
35:43 man you really believe that a good
35:46 example of that might be David Ickes
35:48 reptilian theory that there are
35:50 reptilians that possess human beings and
35:52 that's how human beings get corrupted to
35:55 run the world into the ground so
35:57 everyone that q and on is after is
36:00 they're all possessed by reptilians
36:05 and so what if you had never heard of
36:08 that theory before you've only lightly
36:09 heard of it and they're trying to tell
36:10 you oh my god this woman said that a
36:12 sheriff pulled her over and when he he
36:15 got mad at her he's shape-shifted
36:18 what do you do with them they weren't
36:21 there you weren't there
36:22 okay outrageous claims right I have a
36:28 good friend of mine he is a genius and
36:32 very progressive but there are certain
36:35 theories that we can't discuss and it
36:38 it's always sort of it's actually not
36:41 that frustrating because he and I have
36:43 plenty of other things that we can
36:44 discuss that we enjoy but he's very meat
36:49 and potatoes with what he wants to
36:50 discuss we can discuss music and movies
36:54 in art and culture and sort of politics
36:57 as they exist we can even talk about
36:59 queueing on stuff he's really cool with
37:02 that but if I bring up flat earth
37:06 because when I was on my journey with
37:08 that I would bring it up at dinner and
37:11 boy he did not want to hear that there
37:15 he was just like that is [ __ ] stupid
37:18 and ridiculous and anyone who remotely
37:20 even goes down that path it should be
37:24 utterly embarrassed with themselves I'm
37:29 being nice I'm actually bur phrasing
37:31 great in my opinion we have to be
37:37 careful taking some of that tact because
37:41 what we are looking at is a mechanism in
37:44 the mind to explore a mechanism eken ism
37:47 in the mind that is willing to say well
37:51 I I've been told my whole life I'm a
37:53 $0.05 human being that has no soul by
37:56 the secular scientists that can't
37:58 conceive with such a thing and so this
38:00 is what I believe I'm limited to my
38:02 belief system those religious people
38:04 that come to the door well they're just
38:06 lost
38:06 they're just worshipping cart you know
38:08 comic books there's no spiritual ground
38:11 there's none oh right how sad we think
38:18 right now the other
38:21 flip side of this is that you know
38:24 genius and insanity can go hand in hand
38:27 the snake eating its tail that's what I
38:29 always think of when I think of the
38:31 circle of mental life if you become a
38:34 genius you could go insane because you
38:37 start to open up so many doors but you
38:42 can't make sense of it anymore
38:43 one of the analogies would be that what
38:46 if you were in some sort of prices right
38:50 you know gameshow set and it's not the
38:54 prices right but there's a bunch of
38:55 doors on a wall and you open one door
39:00 and jazz music comes up really intense
39:04 Miles Davis just you know jamming
39:08 super-dense music lots of notes and you
39:12 open up the next door ditz Mozart at his
39:14 most complex form next door next door is
39:18 punk rock you know The Sex Pistols a lot
39:22 of the most upbeat amazingly dense songs
39:26 it just keeps going and going and going
39:28 Skrillex and pop pop pop all the way
39:30 down and every time you can't close the
39:32 doors once you open them doors come off
39:35 in fact maybe they just slide over like
39:37 a Star Trek door so now you're being
39:39 inundated with countless notes that
39:43 belong to countless genres and you could
39:47 go nuts with the bombardment because you
39:52 can hear a jazz note every once in a
39:53 while that's saxophone pretty sure that
39:55 belongs to Miles Davis Miles Davis's
39:58 crew off to the side you'll hear some
40:01 screaming the comes from The Sex Pistols
40:04 but you can't hear the Sex Pistols song
40:07 you can't hear miles on his trumpet you
40:08 can't hear anything
40:11 discreetly and so you go insane so
40:15 that's why most of us naturally go down
40:19 one rabbit hole at a time you want to
40:22 study this at CERN Hadron Collider as it
40:24 relates to the Mendell effect you go
40:25 straight down that rabbit hole and you
40:28 don't pop out for 9/11 all of a sudden
40:32 again one of the exercises I do with
40:34 children that I mentor which happens
40:36 like once every five years or so when
40:39 all the stars align I know the parents
40:42 and I'm talking about more of an
40:46 academic perhaps vocational methodology
40:50 where we're learning skills that
40:51 actually pay the bills right but when it
40:56 gets to a kid that's about nine years
40:57 old I like to play games but you can do
40:59 this a little bit earlier but the kid
41:01 has to be able to count to ten you know
41:04 what a kid learns to count to ten it's
41:06 just sort of like singing the alphabet
41:08 it's just stuck in their brain as a
41:10 memory imprint and sometimes they'll
41:13 know kids sing the alphabet and not
41:15 discretely think of the letters they're
41:16 just singing the song right so what I do
41:19 is I get a kid and I say do you know how
41:22 to count to ten and they'll say sure and
41:24 they'll say do it
41:27 one two three four five six seven eight
41:29 nine ten and I said okay now listen to
41:32 me count to ten
41:34 and I'll say 1 2 3 5 4 6 7 10 9
41:42 look at me really funny well why would
41:45 you count like that that's wrong nicely
41:48 because I wanted you to feel what that
41:49 felt like in your brain when someone did
41:52 it wrong
41:54 technically speaking okay look at me and
41:58 it's like the very first time anyone's
41:59 ever done that to their brain depending
42:05 on the kids intelligence they're you
42:07 know the age and maturity I'll simply
42:08 say what if there was a situation where
42:11 that was the right way to count and that
42:14 way of counting was the way that you
42:17 solved the problem that was very
42:18 important in life and then they start
42:22 looking around the room and you can
42:23 start seeing them apply that little
42:27 mechanism that little algorithm on how
42:29 to switch things up a little bit I'll
42:33 typically do that right before an art
42:35 lesson of some sort and then we'll start
42:38 to you know draw things that are the way
42:43 they usually are like a house which is
42:45 usually a triangle on top of a square
42:48 but then we'll start looking at pictures
42:51 on the internet of really nice homes
42:53 that are designed by architects that are
42:55 say on Malibu beach or something and
42:56 I'll show them like the what is it the
42:58 Starck mansion on that island before
43:00 they blew it up in that one movie and
43:03 I'll say do you see any triangles they
43:06 say no you see shingles on top of the
43:10 house mm-hmm
43:11 nope do you see a chimney on top of us
43:14 well not really but what do you see like
43:18 well it kind of looks like a boat or it
43:21 kind of looks like I don't know
43:22 something different when I say yeah now
43:26 you're starting to see it so we learn it
43:29 one way as the right way because that
43:31 makes everyone say you know good job
43:34 Sally good job Bobby we obviously want
43:38 this skill within ourselves right to
43:40 look at things differently again most
43:42 people you religiously watch the show
43:44 are literally made of that DNA that's
43:46 why you're here
43:49 if you can get through an hour-long
43:50 episode then you have the attention span
43:52 to pretty much study anything in the
43:54 world you really do don't forget that
44:01 the most talented CEOs in the world
44:06 typically have and this is really the
44:09 long version of the approval formula
44:12 they will say no meeting should last
44:16 more than an hour and all of the points
44:19 being communicated in the meeting should
44:21 be communicated in bullet points that
44:23 does not mean the bullet points are
44:24 remedial or stupid or lightweight they
44:27 are exact exactly the opposite they are
44:30 super impactful to the point and it
44:33 stimulates the rest of the hour right
44:35 some folks say there shouldn't meaning
44:37 more than five bullets that we're gonna
44:39 talk about within this hour but gigantic
44:43 organizations run in these circles why
44:48 mention that and though this episode if
44:51 you're gonna be a person who explores
44:53 things and you probably need a method
44:55 that matches your I don't know mental
44:59 aptitude biology whatever but what we're
45:03 talking about in this episode is is one
45:06 if you are a person that's always on a
45:09 journey then you know you're surrounded
45:11 by people that are judging you from time
45:13 to time that don't respect your journey
45:15 they don't think you should be on the
45:16 journey if you're big enough to continue
45:19 listen to this episode and you know that
45:21 you have been the person that has been
45:23 very cynical of other people going on
45:25 journeys but you're interested in
45:27 changing because maybe something shook
45:29 you you know it's weird how that happens
45:32 right people would be like well I I
45:34 thought we all just die and turn into
45:38 dust and there's no spiritual realm of
45:41 anything but then they had a near-death
45:42 experience they floated over their body
45:44 and they looked down and they felt
45:46 wonderful and they felt the other side
45:48 and then they came back down to the body
45:50 like okay okay that's that means there's
45:53 something else going on here I saw
45:56 things in the room I was really there
45:58 when I came in I was passed in fact I
46:00 never was conscious in this room
46:02 I saw the whole room when I went back
46:04 and told the doctor this is what I saw
46:06 in that room they said that's exactly
46:07 the room to take you back there they
46:09 show it to you you're like Jesus how the
46:11 hell did I see this room when I never
46:13 was conscious at any point in the room
46:15 this has happened to people right I had
46:19 a friend of mine share a couple friends
46:23 of theirs that had this experience in
46:26 the last 5 10 years and they said
46:29 something she said something very
46:30 profound about her friends she said that
46:33 they died and came back to life
46:36 both of them did the floating routine
46:38 and both of them had the cynical view of
46:43 being alive like they survived right and
46:46 I had a partner of mine last year that
46:48 died but the bel-air Country Club and
46:51 was defibrillated and awakened and what
46:55 got heart surgery and he's fine today
46:57 hopefully he was totally different he
47:00 was very happy to be alive but then he
47:01 said when he was passed out he goes
47:03 there was nothing because I didn't see
47:05 anything I just blinked and I went out
47:08 maybe there's a different state of death
47:10 that causes this floating routine but
47:12 the guys that said they were resentful
47:15 of being forced to come back to life was
47:17 that when they floated they said they
47:20 were in the most blissful place they've
47:23 ever been in their life they were ready
47:25 to go instantly because of feeling that
47:29 comfort that love that warmth it isn't
47:32 interesting that they were having I
47:36 don't know if they had all five senses
47:38 but it sounds like they gained a few so
47:39 they probably had five that they may
47:41 have given up hearing for something else
47:43 right but they had a very specific
47:48 feeling and these two people as far as I
47:51 know don't know each other at all but
47:52 they both said the same thing and I've
47:54 never heard anyone say that before but
47:56 they resented coming back into a body
47:57 with injuries and with pain and with
48:00 bills and taxes and all that stuff right
48:03 when the doctor from the chemtrail lung
48:07 episode that that thing that went viral
48:09 online
48:12 took a bunch of people up because a
48:13 bunch of people don't want to believe
48:14 that planes do what they do and again we
48:17 can only speculate as to why you haven't
48:19 had any well we've had some people to
48:22 fact that we're not quite sure we
48:24 believe right one guy or one girl saying
48:26 one thing as to the cause we're not sure
48:29 we need to have that come out a couple
48:32 times for people who don't know each
48:33 other right be easy to hoax that
48:36 nowadays because the theories been out
48:38 there for a while it might be easy to
48:40 hoax it now and replicate that you know
48:42 so I said the same thing so the person
48:44 said but you know credentials are a lot
48:46 easier to validate these days but
48:49 someone could honeypot us away but I
48:52 guess they found out that this doctor
48:53 had had some taxes that he didn't pay
48:57 and said he said he's a tax evader now
49:02 let me give you two things one thing
49:04 about am one thing about me turns out
49:07 the doctor went out of the country for
49:08 an extended period of time and his
49:11 American taxes were due and he was
49:13 simply out of the country so he came
49:14 back filed his taxes paid him and he was
49:17 done that's it and I can't remember what
49:22 year to happen to me but someone or
49:26 sorry gonna there was a point in time
49:27 when the IRS sent me a tax return that
49:31 was completely filled out they said that
49:34 I owed them like twenty thousand dollars
49:36 right cuz that's how they do it
49:38 and so I called him and I said what's
49:40 this and I said well we haven't received
49:42 your tax return so we're just filing it
49:43 for you and this is what you owe it
49:46 could have been a scam think about it
49:47 but I don't think it was so I went in'
49:49 filed it and I've always had a business
49:51 and I'm always spending a tremendous
49:52 amount of money investing in my
49:55 businesses and people and equipment and
49:58 so when I took my legal taxes in and
50:02 filed them I think I got back a check
50:03 around $7,000 from federal so I went
50:07 from $20,000 I owed to $7,000 I got back
50:11 alright well what if that was
50:17 the fact I think you know this is what
50:18 it was they actually filed a lien
50:20 against me to pay that it was all in one
50:23 shot you get notified all of this crap
50:25 it's like this you know it is the Mafia
50:27 that it is right it's the intimidation
50:28 also their stuff right which doesn't
50:33 happen anymore it's interesting once
50:34 Aaron Russo and the Tea Party came out
50:36 they're like okay don't push it too much
50:39 unconstitutional so I forget everything
50:41 filed I called and I said how do I get
50:43 this lien off myself
50:44 right did you guys have put on there and
50:47 I didn't know this but they randomly
50:49 will file liens all over your County
50:52 with all these different agencies and
50:53 you have to they don't know they they
50:55 don't have any record of who they file
50:57 these with which is just insane and so
51:00 you have to make like you know three or
51:02 four dozen phone calls to see if anyone
51:05 has something on you and then you fax
51:06 them the sheet from the IRS saying look
51:08 this has now been removed right
51:11 luckily I found the group that had it
51:13 and got it resolved very very quickly
51:15 but if someone were to research my
51:17 background I don't even know if this is
51:19 in some records somewhere assume it is
51:20 they might go oh my god he's a tax
51:23 evader I moved I moved and I got super
51:28 super busy but then I did the right
51:31 thing and got it all worked out right
51:33 but what are those people trying to do
51:35 when they attack people they're trying
51:37 to keep the world the same trying to
51:40 keep everyone in a box and as I always
51:43 try to say they're the kind of people
51:44 that try to deny the future its
51:46 existence obviously there's no method to
51:51 do that futures gonna count no matter if
51:53 you like it or not it doesn't have to go
51:56 down to societal pathways that we've
51:58 been right meaning you know the world
52:03 becomes more immoral and we've got you
52:07 know various parts of the world that
52:08 still sleep with children take them as
52:10 wife's and before they're even ten years
52:12 old we don't have to accept that
52:16 [ __ ]
52:18 but what if you lived in a box what if
52:21 you lived in a box in the Midwest of the
52:22 United States of America and you you
52:25 know you have rules you know women half
52:27 the girls can get married at sixteen but
52:29 they have to have the approval from
52:32 their parents and you can't marry anyone
52:33 over 18 otherwise in statutory rape so
52:37 16 year old boy 260 no girl can get
52:39 married but then there's a point where
52:41 it's sort of illegal for them to sleep
52:42 together if there's any difference in
52:44 age and then but you've got a police
52:46 it's okay whatever it is you're good
52:48 with it and society's good with it you
52:50 don't have some 45 year old man sleeping
52:53 with a 8 year old but you're not paying
52:56 attention to anything because I wouldn't
52:58 say you personally but these people
53:00 won't pay attention anything and the
53:02 rest of the world's going Sharia law
53:04 then all of a sudden there's that knock
53:06 on the door because the rest of real
53:10 converted because they hid from society
53:13 they hid from reality and now everything
53:17 that they cherish is up for grabs but we
53:21 all want world peace right we do even
53:25 your pro-second amendment American
53:27 believe it or not if you really got them
53:29 sat down and calm down and said look if
53:33 there was a way
53:36 probably by God Almighty Himself for
53:40 everyone to become peaceful everyone
53:42 dropped acid on the same day and we
53:44 played nothing but really cool new-age
53:46 music and we could get everyone to love
53:49 each other and see the world from each
53:51 other's perspectives anything that's
53:54 doing harm to anyone a child and adult
53:56 whatever we all suddenly realize what's
53:58 going on
54:01 instantaneously man evolves out of the
54:04 need or desire for war we respect
54:06 boundaries you respect possessions of
54:09 other people we don't steal
54:10 we don't covet we respect even the
54:15 sanctity of marriage and even if we like
54:17 Jesse's girl we don't go for it because
54:20 we respect the feelings of the other guy
54:22 that would be torn apart
54:24 if you stole his wife or his girlfriend
54:27 [Music]
54:29 and you can say I'm not saying this is
54:32 everyone happen but if that could happen
54:33 would you agree to get rid of your guns
54:36 I haven't met a person that wouldn't but
54:41 we know reality don't we we have entire
54:46 groups of people on this planet that are
54:49 anywhere from one to maybe even you know
54:55 compare just compared to the most
54:57 intelligence groups of society we have
55:00 in this world of all races okay compared
55:03 to some of these groups in the world and
55:05 they're peaceful
55:06 groups of people they're not necessarily
55:07 violent some are but usually your most
55:11 primitive people are pretty damn
55:12 peaceful some of them are cannibal is
55:14 still unfortunately but they could be
55:18 10,000 years in the past maybe even
55:20 further back who knows and they exist to
55:23 this day and in the millions there's
55:26 nothing we're gonna do to advance their
55:29 brains right until we come up with that
55:32 matrix neo plug in the back of their
55:34 head that goes
55:35 I know kung foo right they're always
55:38 gonna be behind maybe they evolved from
55:41 peaceful to peaceful maybe maybe they
55:43 make the jump from 10,000 years ago to
55:46 just a couple days ago they can build
55:48 microchips and design cool things and
55:50 play the latest music to play better new
55:52 music and they just develop they skip
55:54 all that [ __ ] that Europe went through
55:57 that the Middle East has gone through
55:59 the fighting and the killing and the
56:01 land grabbing and the haves and the
56:03 have-nots formula that creates world
56:05 wars right maybe but why are they behind
56:10 there's a bunch of theories but I would
56:14 say that one of the most
56:15 the theories maybe even factual is that
56:18 they live in a box
56:21 they live in a box how are we ever going
56:25 to create that possible methodology to
56:28 help these people out well we can't live
56:32 in a box when we can't punish those who
56:35 live outside the box
56:36 even if even if our kids run off and you
56:38 know this happens if you're a parent
56:40 your kids are run off and start
56:41 worshipping something that is stupid you
56:44 know I have friends of all ages because
56:47 I have you know people who are in the
56:50 engineering world boys and girls a lot
56:52 more girls now which is really exciting
56:53 for me I have a kid and when I watch
56:58 what they post on Instagram and Facebook
57:00 it's all about drinking it's all
57:03 drinking I got friends of mine with you
57:05 know drinks and their profile pics
57:07 trying to prove to the world how mature
57:09 they are right no matter how you trace
57:12 it back right anyone who thinks that
57:15 stuff is maturity if someone who's
57:18 susceptible to marketing material now
57:22 I'm not saying that drinking is just 100
57:23 percent ridiculous all I'm saying is
57:25 that kids that try to prove themselves
57:27 through drinking as an adult after
57:31 you're 40 years old you look at that and
57:32 you go they're in that phase they're
57:35 destroying their liver they're
57:36 destroying their brain they probably are
57:38 compromising a lot of opportunities in
57:40 their life because they're drunk they're
57:42 partying all the time they're not
57:44 studying something by getting a
57:45 vocational skill that's employable and
57:49 you know there's nothing you can do you
57:50 can't walk up to them and say you know
57:52 this is stupid why are you doing this to
57:53 yourself you're gonna end up you know
57:55 trying to live in my basement all you
58:01 can do is live by example but people are
58:03 who are in denial and let's closed minds
58:07 they're not very useful in that formula
58:10 are they
58:11 they won't even acknowledge their kids
58:13 are doing what they're doing because
58:14 they don't want accept it and their kid
58:17 might reach out for help and they're not
58:18 there because in their brain they're
58:20 like you do something I don't approve of
58:21 and so instead of dealing with it I just
58:23 ignore it the worst thing about social
58:26 media is making you think you have
58:28 friends that you don't have following
58:30 people you've never met in your life
58:32 right and they don't talk like this on
58:33 the show so you know
58:34 concept of what's going through their
58:36 brain but they live an interesting life
58:39 maybe they have a byproduct it's really
58:40 cool to watch I've got some of these
58:42 friends we all do there's a guy in my
58:44 hometown I swear to God I will get these
58:48 weird invites and this is how it happens
58:50 from you know girls that are trying to
58:53 sell their bodies basically online
58:55 whether it's just look at me I'm pretty
58:57 or hey come watch me in some live chat
59:00 room or something like that I'll get
59:04 these invites and I was report to
59:05 profiles but my buddy's friends with all
59:08 of them so finally I was like how are
59:12 you friends with he's friends with
59:13 people in LA that I actually know but I
59:15 know he's never even been out here I
59:17 know he doesn't know these people so
59:18 I'll go and look and this guy's got
59:21 thousands he lives in my own town he
59:23 never leaves he's got thousands and
59:25 thousands of friendships with everyone
59:27 who's cute everyone who sells I'm a scam
59:29 who's cute he is really getting into
59:32 that formula right and he could do what
59:34 he wants with his life right for me it's
59:37 pointless anyhow I know you feel me this
59:40 episode it's kind of all over the place
59:41 but hopefully it is useful in all of its
59:44 corners I'm not sure what I'm gonna call
59:47 it but I'll put it in the stack if you
59:51 have been to deep thoughts radio calm
59:52 please go
59:53 it has audio and video again the audio
59:55 is iTunes and Google Play I forget to
59:59 mention air one small for those of you
60:00 who dig - Oh routinely and you get
60:02 through iTunes one of the cool things
60:03 you can do to help me out is write a
60:05 review inside iTunes believe they have
60:09 the same thing at Google the links are
60:10 straight on the website we do have a
60:12 lock Facebook group because everything
60:15 is moderated in that group you will
60:18 always get into the group we do monitor
60:23 like really bizarre individuals that
60:25 come in that seem to have like two days
60:27 worth of profile posts and so we don't
60:29 let them in but that's pretty rare I
60:32 also have a patreon page for those who
60:35 want to contribute anything is helpful
60:37 it's good base for cigars and eventually
60:40 will upgrade this camera to a true 4k
60:42 camera just to make the fixes that much
60:44 more sexy anyway take care of yourself
60:47 on someone else that I'll see
60:48 the next deep thoughts over now
