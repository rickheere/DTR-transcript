00:23 you
00:24 [Music]
00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts season
00:37 four ladies and gentlemen and splendor
00:39 is 4k finally just bought the bullet and
00:43 bought the camera today we're gonna open
00:46 this season with an episode about grey
00:49 aliens because over the last six months
00:52 or so I've seen enough that I think we
00:57 should talk about it in a different way
00:58 because you know I got all these alien
00:59 episodes and I even did an episode where
01:02 we sort of postulated the existence of
01:06 aliens
01:07 I mean of greys and just kind of took it
01:09 through a scenario of what if you saw
01:10 one but I just did another review and a
01:14 deep dive of the Roswell crash and new
01:16 Mecca in New Mexico reviewing all the
01:20 individuals that I believe are telling
01:22 the truth and I think for me personally
01:26 coming from a world where I said you
01:28 know these things don't exist I don't
01:32 exist I would articles about the power
01:34 of the myth that they exist how much it
01:37 imbues our military with a big bunch of
01:40 oh my god you know don't mess with the
01:43 military they got [ __ ] nine UFO stuck
01:45 in some warehouse and Bob Lazar is
01:47 having sex with all the portals but
01:50 after reviewing Marcel Jesse Marcel
01:56 senior Jesse Marcel jr. the corner at
02:00 the mortuary in town his account of a
02:05 woman that he met with who's his friend
02:07 and nurse from the hospital and that
02:09 they had these these breakfast together
02:13 routinely and that then she soon
02:16 disappears after this crash then she's
02:20 reported dead in England on some
02:22 maneuver you have all these housewives
02:23 that said my husband wasn't lying and he
02:28 said he saw something you have fathers
02:31 being put into ambulances on the last
02:33 moment that they you know they're I'm
02:34 some health issue they grabbed their
02:37 kids arms and say before going this
02:40 thing because we may never see each
02:41 other again I just need you to know that
02:43 [ __ ] was real I don't know why
02:47 and wearing all that stuff like where
02:49 they came from and all this stuff but I
02:50 saw aliens I saw spaceship it's real
02:53 1947 in Mexico all right you know I did
03:00 an opening episode for season 4 which I
03:04 I don't what the hell it's like one
03:06 reason why I got a new camera is because
03:08 the old one is starting to just have
03:10 problems with cards but it was called
03:12 the I'm gonna rerecord it right after
03:14 this one a different day but it's gonna
03:18 be called the religion of aliens and
03:20 it's going to show how people have
03:21 usurped this whole movement and then
03:24 overlaid on top of it mechanisms that
03:26 seemed to work for evangelical scumbags
03:29 right I don't mean the people I mean the
03:31 preachers that steal their money and say
03:33 they're praying to God but grace all we
03:36 can do is talk about what people have
03:39 said about them in terms of appearing
03:43 all evidence I haven't seen him
03:46 I doubt well I mean I don't know maybe
03:48 maybe I saw him at Christmas at one time
03:50 maybe some of you have claims of seeing
03:52 them doesn't matter if we've seen him we
03:54 got to interact with them to talk to
03:56 them
03:57 I dreamed or I had the experience that I
04:01 met one at Christmas we didn't really
04:02 talk about anything deep except for what
04:04 was in one of my presence and you know
04:06 here I'm 21 years old
04:08 having this experience but there's a
04:11 bunch of people trying to take this
04:12 movement and make it dark a lot of this
04:15 will be covered in the other episode but
04:17 let's just go through grace because I
04:20 have taken major deep dives over the
04:22 years on all the assertions of who they
04:25 are I'm not about you but I find it
04:28 extremely frustrating that well there's
04:33 two sides of the coin right there's
04:36 several two sides but let's do this
04:38 first side is they are good and good I
04:41 would throw in they're benign they're
04:43 not planning on do anything with us they
04:45 just were visiting and they screwed up
04:47 they pushed reverse while they were
04:49 going too fast and the four blew the
04:51 transmission and then we have Marcel
04:54 picking up stuff all over that guy's
04:55 ranch okay then there's this other side
04:59 that supposedly they're bad people
05:01 they're bad and the people is actually
05:02 very interesting because I just saw an
05:04 interview with someone claiming to be
05:07 from the military claiming to have
05:08 converse with them on a routine basis
05:11 and he said you know I call them people
05:15 I think that's important and the s and
05:19 well what is it what do they look like
05:20 he goes well they don't have these
05:22 gigantic eyes that you see in art they
05:24 have these much larger eyes than ours
05:27 they were fairly dark or whatever he
05:30 said super small features but he said
05:31 you know they're they're super refined
05:33 he goes their hands and their mouths and
05:35 their ears and all their limbs and
05:39 falange eyes they look beautiful
05:42 they're manicured through time I just
05:45 had a really funny idea I'm gonna jump
05:48 ahead to make a joke here but a lot of
05:50 theories have come out that these are
05:52 time travelers that they are us we have
05:54 inbred so much with ourselves we look
05:56 like these guys and that we're traveling
05:59 in time back now remember those folks
06:02 that do those those funny things where
06:06 they build crafts that they put on a
06:08 they're like kind of like fake airplanes
06:11 and they go up to a dock or port you
06:15 know and then they they all have a big
06:16 party and they push them off and they go
06:18 into the ocean sometimes they do parades
06:20 like that where people build funny
06:21 little vehicles and they're not meant to
06:23 be street worthy and then they have this
06:25 funny thing where they're drunk as a
06:27 skunk going through the crowds imagine
06:30 that the Roswell crash is one of those
06:33 that it was just some drunk thing makes
06:36 a time machine and then there's this
06:39 boat race you know the bed race or
06:41 whatever the hell the hot tub race and
06:43 here they show up and it all blows up
06:45 and they're just so embarrassed it's got
06:47 you know I beams just riding on it know
06:50 this but before we dive in completely
06:53 let's just review and for those of you
06:54 who've never taken a deep dive into the
06:56 Roswell crash but you've heard about it
06:58 let me refresh your memory
07:00 it's I believe late June something is a
07:05 big storm going on and something falls
07:07 out of the sky it is witnessed by very
07:11 few people
07:12 who knows of the military witnessed
07:14 anything
07:14 it seems that they didn't because they
07:17 didn't know it was there until the
07:18 pedestrians told them it was there they
07:21 reported as a flying saucer then picked
07:23 the thing up and then go and grab all
07:25 the newspapers and then released this
07:27 press statement that it wasn't a flying
07:29 saucer it was a weather balloon on the
07:31 pedestrian side you have an
07:35 archaeologist with his students several
07:38 miles away seeing this thing fall out of
07:39 the sky like a falling star but the
07:42 strong was too intense so he's like well
07:44 we'll go look at it in the morning
07:45 the rancher whose name escapes me here
07:48 I'm making an episode about this forgot
07:49 his name but he goes out and he finds
07:52 this 200 to 300 yard debris field
07:56 all these little scraps of stuff and
07:58 there's made of three different things a
07:59 very matte finished aluminum foil that's
08:02 sort of like that really thick aluminum
08:04 foil you'll get at some restaurants or
08:06 for industrial uses making an Apollo 11
08:10 lunar lander some black plastic that
08:13 looks like it's baked plastic so it's
08:15 fairly brittle nothing super out of this
08:19 world we could make it and then a bunch
08:22 of eye beams that are sixteenth of an
08:24 inch thick very tiny small slightly just
08:29 take a ruler an average ruler in America
08:31 I don't know what they look like and you
08:33 got a big meter stick what a pain in the
08:34 ass to live in [ __ ] Europe right now
08:36 you got your meter stick yeah it's I got
08:39 it it's in my quiver you know in America
08:42 we have feet
08:43 that's just great so so does England
08:46 take a ruler and turn it into an i-beam
08:49 by three rulers and turn into an IV
08:51 that's about the width of these i-beams
08:54 and these i-beams have writing embedded
08:56 in them in a purplish pink symbols that
09:01 Marcel this other guy we're going to get
09:03 into transcribed on paper it's beautiful
09:08 apparently no one owned a camera the
09:12 farmer goes out there sees all this crap
09:15 then he finds this crash vehicle the
09:19 crash vehicle and this is where I don't
09:21 even know if he got to the actual
09:23 vehicle because if hey if he had gotten
09:26 to the vehicle I think a story might
09:28 have been
09:28 a little bit more intense when he came
09:29 home to the missus but he reports this
09:33 to the police who then reported to the
09:35 military this Jesse Marcel comes out
09:39 he's a part of intelligence at the
09:40 Roswell basin for those of you don't
09:42 know what's going on here you have
09:43 Roswell Air Force Base which is a base
09:46 that specializes in secret aircraft and
09:50 it specializes in weather balloons
09:53 making top-secret ones that can go up in
09:56 the air and listen to shockwaves up
09:58 there that might be a result of a
10:00 nuclear bomb being exploded over in
10:03 Russia so Marcel he's a top dog
10:07 intelligence officer he knows what a
10:11 weather balloon looks like a thousand
10:13 percent right at the time we're talking
10:16 about 80 percent of weather balloons
10:17 weren't recovered they just fell
10:19 wherever they fell in the world and no
10:20 one went and got them but a couple
10:22 occasions you know there'd be some
10:23 secret hardware hanging off of them and
10:25 so they go get 20% of them but Marcel
10:28 gets out there and looks down at this
10:30 stuff and does not recognize anything a
10:34 weather balloon uses a very thin foil
10:37 that is mounted on paper and it's used
10:40 as either a target where the radars can
10:43 hit it and they can say oh that's where
10:44 it is then thus differential you figure
10:47 out this is where the sensors are
10:49 because we figure out the top is we know
10:50 the bottom is so he's seeing these three
10:54 pieces these three materials and he is
10:56 flipping out he's got a pickup truck he
10:58 fills the back of the pickup truck with
11:00 as much of this stuff as he can and
11:01 there's just tons of it I mean this must
11:05 have been they said was like a 30-foot
11:06 saucer so I mean it's got a pretty good
11:07 amount of this stuff but sparse and so
11:11 then he does two things when I'm not
11:14 sure exactly which order this is in I
11:16 believe the first trip that he made was
11:19 to his home where he has the son and his
11:21 wife he rushes in really early in the
11:24 morning and says you guys have to see
11:27 this because you'll never see it again
11:30 according to his son Jesse Marcel jr.
11:33 who became an ear nose and throat
11:34 physician surgeon what I understand
11:39 who told his story several times over
11:42 the course of 30 years and seemed to
11:43 stick to his story pretty pretty well he
11:46 said my father to my recollection never
11:48 said it was a flying saucer I never knew
11:50 to ask because who would write where's
11:53 this come from a flying saucer I mean
11:54 it'd be like someone giving you a you
11:56 know a wrapper off a Big Mac and you're
11:58 like was this come from a flying saucer
11:59 right if you don't have any concept
12:00 you're not gonna ask the question so he
12:03 shows him the thicker foil the black
12:06 plastic and the thinner are the end the
12:08 i-beam supposedly there's two types of
12:10 foils one's a little shinier but most of
12:12 it's the same his son never tries to
12:14 fold up the foil which is something
12:17 where to get to in the next visit it's a
12:19 very famous thing about the foil
12:20 everyone always talks about it I have
12:24 definitely heard stories about Marcel
12:27 jr. having actually kept some of this
12:30 and that he did play with the foil and
12:32 then it did have memory but I just
12:35 recently saw an interview when he was 71
12:36 at a podium for MUFON and he talked
12:38 about the book he's writing to get it
12:40 all down on paper and he said no such
12:44 thing but he's pretty damn consistent
12:47 with this story now in the background
12:50 you have tons of intelligence officers
12:52 that are picking crap up and they live
12:53 in Roswell right the whole thing is a
12:56 military base town okay so they're
13:00 telling their wives in secret that this
13:03 stuff happened and all these wife's came
13:05 out and he gave their recordings in fact
13:07 friends of wife's friends of wife's of
13:10 who were secretaries who were shown
13:11 alien bodies of these greys who then
13:14 later died mysteriously in hotels
13:16 registered under her sister's name they
13:18 got to a point where they were killing
13:19 people to cover this up but the second
13:23 group that Marcel senior said he brought
13:26 this material to and this is all part of
13:27 our evidence to have a discussion about
13:30 a gray because we have to say the only
13:34 event that I believe that that 100%
13:36 occurred is Roswell crash for me
13:38 personally and so we had to review what
13:41 we saw and what it would mean so Jesse
13:44 Marcel senior is supposed to be at his
13:45 house hosting a bridge game for those of
13:48 you who are not familiar with bridge
13:49 it's just a card game my grandparents
13:51 did this around me
13:53 constantly you have bridge parties
13:55 there's usually at least three if not
13:57 four if not five couples that come to
14:00 play because you have to play in pairs
14:01 of two so two against two so it's a
14:03 table of four I never figured out how to
14:05 play bridge but it's like yeah bet and
14:08 I'm gonna these bids you can get or
14:10 whatever and you keep points so they're
14:14 having this bridge game but senior never
14:15 shows up and so one of his buddy steps
14:18 in you're talking about all the
14:20 husband's and some of the wife's are all
14:22 and tell people over at the base they're
14:25 not thinking anything of it and get call
14:27 that every once in a while right well
14:30 they play several rounds and then all of
14:32 a sudden Jesse shows up to his house so
14:35 just he's supposed to be heading up the
14:37 bridge game I don't know if it's at his
14:39 house which I mean it's the same exact
14:40 location at a later time or what the
14:43 deal is but he was supposed to be
14:44 leading this bridge game and his buddy
14:45 jumps in to do the job for playing games
14:49 and eventually Jesse shows up with this
14:54 stuff in a box so he shows up and he
15:00 just comes in the door he says folks you
15:01 got to come see this
15:02 I got debris from a flying saucer and
15:07 everyone's like really a flying saucer
15:09 and he's like yeah come on let's go so
15:12 he gets him out there and they grab a
15:16 bunch and they bring it in and he says
15:17 they just took a few of these pieces out
15:19 because he had the whole back of this
15:20 pickup truck full of this stuff and so
15:24 the ask you old men who run it or in the
15:25 bridge game you know what did you see
15:27 and he says why I saw three different
15:28 things a really thick foil this black
15:32 plastic and these i-beams and he talked
15:37 about the writing you know these i-beams
15:38 have writing embedded in them okay one
15:41 of the one of the debunking things is oh
15:43 it's some tape that was bought from a
15:45 toy company and they finally showed
15:49 Marcel jr. the tape 30 40 years later
15:52 and he said it was a joke this tape was
15:54 flour tape and it was everything was
15:57 hollow inside the flour so is like an
15:59 outline of flowers like some photo Luna
16:02 for loon thing and he said it wasn't
16:05 anything like this
16:07 that I saw this was embedded in the
16:08 steel and it had sort of like a
16:10 petroleum reflection of a purple pink so
16:15 I was glad to hear that distinction
16:16 because what they what they have done
16:17 census and I'll get back to the story in
16:19 sec is they keep calling people up and
16:21 saying well you didn't see that did you
16:22 what you really saw was a weather
16:25 balloon a weather balloon how weather
16:26 balloon you saw tape tape tape tape just
16:29 trying to brainwash them through
16:30 repetition alright that's the most basic
16:33 form of brainwashing but this guy said
16:35 look I took the foil and he goes I
16:38 crushed it in my hand he says very thick
16:41 matte finish foil he says I let go and
16:45 it went back to the same shape now what
16:47 I have never heard until recently and
16:49 this interviews been out there for a
16:50 while so some of you have seen this
16:51 before as he goes it went back
16:54 instantaneously meaning by the time my
16:57 hand had flattened out it was it had
17:00 returned to its original shape so you
17:02 don't see it crawl back into its shape
17:05 slowly like some of this memory metal
17:07 that we have or if you you take certain
17:10 metals and you you mold it with
17:13 different levels of thickness you can
17:15 run electrons over it and it will
17:17 actually stimulate some movement and
17:18 you'll see these little you know these
17:20 little origami robots hop around or when
17:23 so happy it's like yeah mm-hmm it's all
17:26 gonna work out origami robots mm-hmm now
17:30 if they can make that stuff emulate the
17:31 muscles in a leg well then we got
17:33 something going here
17:34 but this guy was very matter-of-fact and
17:36 he goes the next day we show up at work
17:40 and Jesse brings in a box of the stuff
17:43 and it's got the i-beams it's got the
17:44 plastic it's got the foil we played
17:47 around with it for two hours he said no
17:49 big deal we're all and to Intel people
17:52 and said then we all went back to work
17:53 and then he said a few hours later he
17:56 said the word boom they came in and said
17:59 you can't nothing happened this was a
18:02 non-event so it never occurred you're
18:05 not to speculate on it or anything you
18:07 know nothing now most the people in the
18:08 room hadn't seen it they hadn't been
18:10 there then picked anything up but they
18:12 definitely play with Marcel's junk right
18:16 switch over to the corner I'll go a
18:18 little bit quicker on this one the
18:20 corner is called
18:21 by the military and says what do you do
18:22 to preserve a body really really fast he
18:26 says I don't know what your pathologists
18:29 want to do with the body versus gonna do
18:30 an autopsy or something you know what
18:32 are you trying to do you're just trying
18:33 to put it in the ground what are you
18:34 trying to do and they said well we just
18:36 need a really quick answer he goes put
18:38 it on ice get a really cold really
18:40 really fast you got to cool off the
18:41 inside bacteria you're gonna start doing
18:42 its thing and they said well do you have
18:45 any coffins this for kids and he said
18:48 well yeah I do have a few and he goes
18:50 okay we're gonna come by and pick him up
18:51 supposedly they came by and picked him
18:53 up I think that that last step occurred
18:57 so now he's really curious he's like
18:59 what the hell's going on has there been
19:01 a horrible accident when where kids got
19:03 hurt I'm he's freaked out so he goes to
19:04 the hospital on the base and he talks to
19:06 a nurse it's a friend it is he bumps
19:10 into her in the hallway and she's coming
19:11 out because she is sick and her eyes are
19:14 red and he's like what the hell's wrong
19:17 she's like you got to get out of here
19:19 you know this is this is I'll tell you
19:22 everything but this isn't a good time
19:24 not a good place of course he's
19:27 concerned he's like is there a big deal
19:28 going he's she's like I can't even talk
19:30 to you about this you know we do we do
19:31 breakfast I'll tell you the next
19:32 breakfast so reluctantly he waits until
19:37 the next morning or whatever and they
19:39 have breakfast and she is distraught she
19:41 doesn't look like she has slept she
19:45 passes notes across the table
19:48 it's drawings of little alien hands it's
19:51 drawings of all kinds of stuff his
19:52 body's a little as much as she could
19:54 remember she said she was assisting in
19:58 autopsy with two other physicians they
20:00 were all getting sick and when I was a
20:02 kid I thought it was sick because what
20:03 they saw was gross in the mountain and
20:05 later I grew up and said why would they
20:06 be sick their physicians and she
20:08 explained to him every time we cut him
20:09 open this sulfur is just part of their
20:12 body and it's really gaggy and gross and
20:14 it starts to consume the oxygen in the
20:16 room and you know we got problems so we
20:17 were kind of throwing up on a routine
20:19 basis after a while because it makes us
20:21 queasy so apparently I think they had a
20:23 couple a couple of breakfasts a couple
20:26 morning dinners and then she gets
20:30 transferred out of the base
20:32 and she says to him I'm gonna get
20:34 transferred I'm being transferred I
20:36 don't know where I'm going but when I'm
20:37 going I'm gonna write you a really
20:38 incidental letter just letting you know
20:40 where I am
20:40 and she makes true on her commitment I
20:44 think it was like three weeks or three
20:46 months later or whatever she says him a
20:48 little bit nine letters says hey how you
20:49 doing just once you know him at Fort
20:50 Bubba which I think was in England some
20:53 American base over there but then he
20:56 doesn't hear from her for like six
20:58 months and he's kind of concerned so he
20:59 puts in a request for information on her
21:02 and finds out she died she died in some
21:05 exercise with four other nurses and so
21:10 he his personal belief was that she
21:13 wasn't actually murdered she wasn't dead
21:15 she just was disappeared through some
21:17 accident so she could continue research
21:19 or what-have-you
21:19 maybe she was murdered who knows and
21:23 then you have all the wife's and then
21:25 you have all the kids who have
21:26 experienced deathbed confessions and
21:28 given great accounts of this whole thing
21:30 in terms of the actual crash itself just
21:34 a quick review
21:35 you have three aliens that were on this
21:37 ship the ship is embedded in the ground
21:40 a little bit blown outside again it has
21:43 to be enough circumference on the ship
21:45 with its thickness I'm gonna have you to
21:47 account for all the debris so it must
21:48 have been pretty damn big one alien has
21:52 burned up really bad you can't even
21:53 recognize it could be a human could be
21:55 an alien but except it's small looks
21:57 like a child the second one is very
21:59 badly injured and kind of you know
22:02 moving a little bit and one of them
22:04 appears to be perfect small family found
22:10 it absolutely serendipitously weren't
22:13 trying to find anything specific in the
22:15 desert they find it a little
22:17 eight-year-old boy went over and thought
22:19 that the alien was a puppet or some sort
22:23 of toy and so he sits down right next to
22:25 it and they're all sitting on these mats
22:27 like the they think that the alien that
22:29 survived put his buddies on these two
22:31 mats and he's sitting on one himself and
22:33 kind of a shiny mat right and so he puts
22:37 his hand his right hand on the left
22:39 thigh of this alien and it moves and
22:43 then the kid realizes it's a living
22:46 and freaks out jumps up runs behind his
22:49 father and just like little kids do when
22:51 they grab onto the thigh of a parent
22:52 they're looking and he's just terrified
22:54 he's having this burned into his memory
22:56 right you said his cousin had gone up on
22:59 the ridge and was kind of looking around
23:00 at the ship
23:01 his father is there what I believe is
23:03 uncle they're trying to speak different
23:05 languages to it if it's like oh yeah
23:08 it's really kind of funny obviously
23:10 doesn't know what the hell's going on so
23:11 a few minutes into that exercise the
23:13 archaeologists from the day before with
23:14 four students shows up he knows six
23:18 languages he stowed he's doing his thing
23:19 you can find the interview with this
23:22 eight-year-old kid as a grown adult
23:24 later on I know you you know I have to
23:26 deprecate it myself a little bit because
23:28 he is eight years old but I'll tell you
23:29 what I couldn't I can just I could do a
23:32 whole show on me being eight years old
23:33 and I guarantee you I am 98% correct on
23:37 all the things that happened to me when
23:39 I was eight so I have a lot of faith in
23:41 an eight-year-old kid and I would rather
23:42 hear from a kid that grew up that has
23:44 very little to to gain from it because
23:48 you have to understand Marcel jr. didn't
23:51 write a book until this century very
23:53 recently through whatever organ it may
23:55 be publish it through MUFON or something
23:57 and his father didn't write a book until
23:59 1978 his father kept it under wraps
24:01 until 78 but there hasn't been that much
24:03 money made on this thing okay and it
24:06 certainly didn't make an overwhelming
24:09 impression on the public that you had
24:11 your [ __ ] together you were a nut case
24:14 to a bunch of people that can't handle
24:16 it and then you were a hero
24:17 so the you apologists are like finally
24:20 someone saying something right this is
24:23 the information we have about the most
24:25 credible visit albeit accidental of gray
24:30 alien of three great aliens god bless
24:35 those that didn't survive as far as
24:38 those folks that were at the saucer a
24:40 Jeep shows up a redhead redheaded white
24:42 guy shows up with a another
24:44 african-american gentleman he said the
24:47 african-american was very polite and
24:49 courteous while the redhead guy was a
24:51 complete [ __ ] to them yelling and
24:53 screaming death threats and stuff forced
24:55 them all into their wherever the hell
24:58 Humvee had whatever
24:59 and took him away and the archaeologist
25:01 was really pissed off because he
25:02 approached from the south and his car
25:04 and everything was at the south and
25:05 they're forced him to go north he's like
25:06 look I can't go that way and of course
25:09 they told him to go F himself and the
25:11 kids said the last thing he could he
25:13 could remember seeing was looking out
25:15 the back window of their their home
25:17 vehicle and watching the archaeologists
25:21 screaming at the co that grabbed them
25:25 that's how he saw but he said by the
25:27 time they got to the road they had cargo
25:29 jets landing all kinds of vehicles
25:31 landing I mean it was an extraction
25:33 situation man okay why were they here
25:38 and who were they
25:39 if this alien was taken into the
25:44 military and they were able to establish
25:46 communication with it in which according
25:47 to Jesse Marcel senior who I do believe
25:51 I I know I've seen the video where he
25:53 was walking around the the crash site
25:56 and he was getting really teary eyed he
25:57 pretty much lost all of his teeth and he
25:59 was just saying I was right here and he
26:02 was right here and he couldn't speak
26:04 words but he was communicating with me
26:07 through thoughts and he simply said he
26:08 said I could feel this utter despair and
26:13 sort of just heartbroken nature about
26:18 him and he said you know okay I've it's
26:21 okay man he's like he was trying to calm
26:22 down Marcel senior according to this
26:25 story and he said I know I'm here and
26:28 the interesting thing is he said don't
26:31 worry nobody's coming for us I find that
26:36 interesting and then supposedly he's
26:39 picked up right so US military would
26:44 have been the one to pick him up
26:46 wright-patterson Air Force Base got the
26:49 vehicle with all of its debris it never
26:51 came off the plane and went into the
26:54 briefing room where Ramsey forced
26:57 ourselves senior to lie about it being a
27:00 hot weather balloon excuse me obviously
27:01 a hot air balloon weather balloon
27:03 the gentleman who packed it all up and
27:06 put it in the plane from Roswell to Fort
27:10 Worth stared at the vehicle as his pack
27:13 cos he said which weighed nothing went
27:15 into this other plane and took off now
27:17 in terms of the gigantic saucer I don't
27:20 know how you move that thing helicopters
27:22 or whatever definitely would not fit
27:24 inside of a fuselage of any modern plane
27:26 back in those days right talking 47
27:29 people
27:29 everything's prop planes to move it in
27:32 the middle of the night you know but who
27:35 could they have been what's the argument
27:38 for the existence of aliens what is it
27:43 well it's a big world it's round its
27:46 heliocentric and we're floating in space
27:49 and stars or stars they're really far
27:53 away they're just like our Sun but
27:55 they're really far away and around those
27:57 are orbiting planets and once you do
27:58 some basic math on it forget the Big
28:00 Bang [ __ ] you have trillions and
28:03 billions and good good you know
28:04 quadrillions times each other right
28:06 grains of sand surely there is going to
28:12 be some life-forms out there that's how
28:14 it gets inserted into the narration but
28:17 that's the heliocentric model which i
28:20 think has a lot of validity in terms of
28:22 making sense on paper right you have
28:27 your flat earth community that believes
28:30 in a firmament dome and it's supposed to
28:33 be God just on the outside of the dome
28:35 well hmm what's God doing sending these
28:42 things down oh there's a theory there's
28:46 the theory about it right these are
28:48 angels and then it went angels for a
28:51 long time until that got tired and they
28:53 couldn't sell any books based on that
28:54 and they said nope nope nope I'm gonna
28:56 reverse it they're demons and that's
28:59 playing out right now greys or demons
29:04 was that dr. Jacobs he does all this
29:07 kind of amateur alien abduction
29:10 interviews he says that the greys are no
29:12 longer a part of the sort of zeitgeist
29:15 of mankind and so they're all talking
29:18 about hybrids now you forget very few
29:21 very few grey stories anymore they're
29:25 stories about them being
29:27 found in the ground living in caverns
29:29 you know or their refuse their physical
29:32 waste is just everywhere it stinks and
29:34 they're just living in the ground
29:35 they're just like sleestaks from Land of
29:38 the Lost wouldn't it be funny if that
29:41 was true Atlanta they all lost was like
29:43 a prophecy absolutely horrible child's
29:46 show in the 70s then I watched probably
29:49 nearly every episode twice I just say
29:53 horrible is a I don't even remember a
29:56 single episode specifically but the
29:58 budgets were really low it's poor guys
30:00 right with fine earth you have all kinds
30:02 of wild things and flat earth is sort of
30:05 one of these things that it's not
30:06 heliocentric it's more matrix you know
30:07 it's more like it's a computer
30:08 simulation
30:09 or it's some very interesting construct
30:13 that makes no physical sense but it's
30:15 held together by God and he has given us
30:18 all kinds of life forms and it's time we
30:20 start bumping into each other right if
30:23 it's not God that built the firmament
30:24 dome well then it would probably be some
30:27 other species it could be us right just
30:30 like Truman Show
30:31 it could be aliens who have built it and
30:35 just like the Twilight zones they they
30:37 keep us captive in this cage it's big
30:40 enough that we don't notice the edge
30:42 then we get into cold waters and we have
30:45 ice barriers around us yeah maybe we do
30:47 come from a heliocentric world and maybe
30:49 we are on a heliocentric ball but we're
30:53 inside a little bubble we're inside a
30:55 big contact lens and they have the
30:58 ability to look at us shooting stars
31:01 yeah that's just one of them flying by
31:04 on one of their spacecraft of course
31:06 always comes back to some of the moon
31:07 but we can't derail this whole thing off
31:09 on flat earth right according to
31:11 everything that we have heard eyewitness
31:14 wise about these greys there is nothing
31:18 evil about them whatsoever zero if they
31:23 were evil the eight-year-old kids
31:25 sitting down next to this great alien
31:27 who put his hand on his left thigh he
31:31 would have just strangled that kid to
31:32 death or [ __ ] vaporized him or
31:34 whatever right act act boom right
31:37 according to Jesse Marcel scene
31:40 who did the interview I think in the I
31:44 don't know it was like 70s or 80s when
31:47 someone was videotaping and with like a
31:49 home video camera and he's getting teary
31:52 eyed about the whole thing it's like
31:54 what does this guy have to gain he's
31:57 lost most of his teeth he's like what is
31:59 he gonna do this is for the last million
32:02 dollars you know no and that's what's
32:05 interesting about all these people these
32:07 wives these kids I think probably 90% of
32:11 the people I've seen when I did research
32:13 on them they're not authors of any books
32:15 not these housewives right one poor
32:19 woman had a best friend who was a
32:20 receptionist at the base and she said
32:23 that she was or maybe the hospital but
32:26 she was invited in to take a look at the
32:29 bodies and they was very interesting
32:32 because she came back to her friend and
32:33 said you know well you know what did you
32:35 see and she said something very unique
32:37 which she goes well they wouldn't let me
32:39 go in and get really really close to it
32:42 but what they allowed me to do was to
32:43 stand in the door jamb it's about 15
32:46 feet away on a table and she said it was
32:52 there I saw it she went home that night
32:54 told her family at the dinner table and
32:57 then she was the next day someone
33:01 figured out that she saw it because
33:02 someone probably said well you know if
33:04 you shown this to anybody only how the
33:05 receptionist oh you [ __ ] idiots oh my
33:08 god so they get her and they threatened
33:10 her with everything or pinched in her
33:12 life killing her kids killing her
33:14 husband ba ba ba so she she doesn't
33:17 spread the Newton news anymore but she
33:19 has to go back home to her family and
33:20 say okay I told you these things but you
33:22 can't tell anybody I wasn't supposed to
33:24 see it and I wasn't supposed to tell you
33:25 in fact this event never occurred you
33:28 know you know that's the stuff right
33:29 your family members like geez if there's
33:31 a child which there were at least two
33:34 how do they grasp that you know Jesse
33:37 Marcel jr. said you know he said I had
33:40 no problem not talking about it to
33:41 anyone he goes it would come up and it
33:43 was I had just accepted that it had it
33:46 hadn't occurred because my father was
33:47 very Stern about it and he goes I had no
33:50 problems denying it until 1978 my father
33:52 started coming out with it and telling
33:54 me
33:54 personally on a private matter but this
33:57 receptionist checked into a hotel this
34:00 is like the Marilyn Monroe death right
34:03 or the Dorothy Kilgallen death checks
34:07 into this hotel under her sister's name
34:10 this is a woman you can I probably in
34:13 the 50s by then but they didn't say what
34:16 year she died this is her best friend
34:17 telling the story and getting really
34:18 choked up this old woman she was old as
34:20 my grandmother's before they passed
34:22 right in her 70s and she goes she was
34:26 checked in this hotel in her sister's
34:27 name and then died of a overdose because
34:32 that's believable so I personally
34:35 believe that there is ample evidence
34:37 that they are not evil right and you
34:41 know you could split her hair for years
34:42 want you know the damn word would never
34:44 tell you he's the devil
34:45 he just tend to be your friend yeah what
34:51 if he caught the devil with his pants
34:52 down you know and he can kill you in two
34:56 seconds hmm I'm thinking you don't catch
35:01 the devil crashing his spaceship with
35:02 his two buddies but now what
35:04 organization forms fairly quickly after
35:07 World War two the space agency known as
35:10 NASA now despite Verna von Braun's uber
35:14 success pardon the pun with the v1 of v2
35:19 rockets just hurling them all over the
35:20 place and killing people in England
35:22 indiscriminately with conventional
35:25 warheads it takes him quite a long time
35:29 to get a rocket - supposedly go into low
35:32 orbit and compete with Sputnik takes an
35:36 even longer time to build anything that
35:38 looks like Saturn 5 that would give us
35:40 the idea that we could potentially
35:42 travel to the moon which we didn't yeah
35:47 just about the time that the moon
35:49 missions are over like I say the ICBMs
35:51 were all ready to go which is what they
35:53 were really building but about five
35:56 years after ICBM show up we have this
35:58 thing called the Space Shuttle it's all
36:01 white its gleaming white when it was
36:03 first made and they realized they can
36:05 save like I don't know 70 thousand
36:07 pounds
36:08 or some [ __ ] by not paying the
36:09 censure censure central tank also turned
36:13 orange little Masonic homage perhaps but
36:18 then what starts happening we started
36:19 putting up all these satellites
36:21 supposedly I think most of them owned by
36:23 alphabet agencies to spy on us to spy on
36:26 our enemies you have geocentric
36:28 satellites that just sit there and hover
36:29 in one place because they're rotating
36:30 the same speed of the earth and you have
36:33 satellites that go in circles because
36:35 they're mapping stuff I think most
36:37 everything is a geocentric satellite
36:40 invented by arthur c clarke who wrote
36:43 2001 Space Odyssey and then we start
36:46 getting space stations supposedly right
36:50 space stations are interesting space
36:52 stations are incredibly faked on the
36:55 internet so NASA's got all kinds of
36:58 dudes on wires or rotoscoping the stuff
37:01 out sometimes we catch them grabbing
37:03 wires and people floating by on
37:04 harnesses I mean it's absolutely
37:06 laughable right there was a movie made
37:09 in 1978 released in 78 called the Close
37:12 Encounters of a Third Kind it was an
37:15 interesting fictional exercise in the
37:19 notion that these aliens not typically
37:23 not specifically noted as greys but they
37:26 were flying all over the United States
37:30 eventually Richard Dreyfuss this
37:32 character gets burned on one side of his
37:34 face looking out of his truck and he has
37:37 a big magnetic experience was all the
37:40 [ __ ] in his utility vehicle was going in
37:42 circles he's late getting to a job they
37:46 fire him and so he's like on his own his
37:48 wife thinks she's nuts because he starts
37:50 building pyramids and pyramids with
37:52 everything his mashed potatoes with clay
37:55 he's cutting out every single article
37:57 about UFOs and eventually you know his
38:00 wife is supporting him up to a up to a
38:01 point she eventually flips out the data
38:05 he starts building a gigantic wall in
38:07 the living room while the living room
38:09 and not the backyard God knows why she
38:11 takes off with the kids and and Richard
38:14 goes on a pilgrimage to find out what
38:17 the hell is going on bumps into another
38:18 woman who had a kid abducted by these
38:20 unseen alien
38:22 she's like I'm trying to find my kid
38:24 he's like I'm just trying to find out
38:26 what the hell's going on then we get the
38:28 famous bump bump bump bump bone and that
38:31 is a GPS coordinate to go to Devil's
38:33 Tower an old derelict column of a
38:37 volcano back when the Earth's crust was
38:40 a lot taller and the circumference of
38:42 the world was a lot smaller
38:43 dude expanding earth but they hide on
38:47 one side of that Devil's Tower they come
38:48 up with a fake epidemic scare everybody
38:50 away Richard in this woman in this
38:53 archaeologists are not an architect I
38:55 think it was what he was they don't buy
38:57 it they go around the side and they
38:59 start watching it one guy gets gassed
39:01 but he and the chick make it he gets
39:03 down he watches this amazing interaction
39:05 with the mothership and the military
39:08 sure enough what comes out is pretty
39:10 much a 1970s rendition of a grey the
39:15 female is really tall SuperDuper tall we
39:18 have no idea ten feet tall whatever very
39:19 lanky and the little little ones are
39:22 males Whitley Strieber picked up on this
39:24 when he wrote his book community in the
39:27 original movie Richard Dreyfuss somehow
39:30 makes friends very quickly with the
39:33 military and he says look I want to go
39:35 you don't see any this dialog but a
39:36 bunch of guys are dressed in red
39:38 jumpsuits given a little survival case
39:40 while all these like people who
39:42 disappeared in Bermuda Triangle are
39:44 popping out the little kid pops out goes
39:46 to his mom so they're bringing back all
39:49 these people safely they're not bad
39:50 people
39:50 not bad aliens alien people Richard goes
39:55 up into the ramp they all touch him and
39:57 they guide him into the ramp it closes
39:59 and he takes off roll credits that's how
40:01 the first version went it was later
40:03 extended to give it the DVD a little bit
40:06 of pizzazz and they showed the inside of
40:09 the trip inside and it was it was okay
40:14 it was alright but it's better to leave
40:16 it to your imagination right because I'm
40:18 dreaming us something that's appropriate
40:20 for my fascination and you're dreaming
40:21 of something is fascinating for your
40:23 appreciation but the more Hollywood
40:25 loses all of its talent it starts
40:27 getting pragmatic and returning
40:28 everything why Luke why Spielberg
40:31 everyone for that I don't know because
40:32 he's a genius
40:33 ready player one
40:35 excluded so the question is have we made
40:40 contact after the fact was the little
40:42 evening guy wrong when he told Marcel
40:45 senior that no one's coming don't even
40:48 worry about it
40:50 his bob lazar the guy that went to area
40:53 51
40:53 and worked supposedly in s4 we know he
40:57 worked in area 51 we don't know if he
40:59 goes to s4 but he said he's reverse
41:00 engineering antimatter engines and the
41:02 base of this saucer a pristine saucer
41:06 that didn't have any injuries on it
41:08 obviously it wouldn't be the same saucer
41:11 that would have landed in Roswell but he
41:14 also noted I believe the total number
41:16 was like nine others totaling 10 with
41:20 all kinds of different shapes and all
41:22 kinds of damage on them and stuff that
41:23 he never never checked those out maybe
41:26 he's there now and checking them all out
41:27 according to John Lear right but here's
41:30 my question for you I know it took a
41:32 long time to get there what would you do
41:35 if a siren went through my show all we
41:39 know is that they exist at that point if
41:42 you adopt this theory which I have okay
41:45 it's just my choice right you will hear
41:48 people talk about the fact that NASA has
41:52 well a NASA and the government I guess
41:54 you could say a military we don't know
41:56 who really really owns and operates
41:59 area 51's for it seems like there's
42:01 military dudes at the door but they
42:04 don't have to be military people that
42:06 anyone can control several presidents
42:09 supposedly wanted to go and visit and
42:11 were denied Jimmy Carter being one
42:12 eisenhower being another be very
42:15 interesting to see if Trump ever tries
42:16 to go like I said I met a woman from the
42:19 equivalent base in the UK and she said
42:22 tony blair who was the prime minister at
42:24 the time cannot get to her base without
42:26 permission
42:27 un-fuckin'-believable right you're the
42:29 president of that country and you can't
42:32 go somewhere in your own country because
42:34 there's something that's so secret you
42:36 as the commander-in-chief of your
42:38 country cannot see well how do you make
42:42 decisions that represent the
42:44 constituents which are the citizens of
42:46 your country if you don't understand all
42:48 of the threats and
42:49 applications of hidden technology and
42:51 relationships with extraterrestrial
42:53 beings absolutely unbelievable that that
42:58 is actually a true fact in the United
42:59 States of America as well
43:02 the story goes is that Jimmy Carter was
43:04 flying over that territory and said I
43:06 want you to land this in area 51 they
43:09 call down for permission and sit sorry
43:10 sir you can't do that now in the 70s
43:14 were a little more docile to things like
43:16 that but things are changing right the
43:20 real fear would be this these creatures
43:24 somehow have to make first contact
43:26 because of roswell they do they don't
43:29 leave their guys behind just like we
43:31 don't leave our guys behind unless
43:32 you're John McCain we go and pick up the
43:36 remains we go and pick up and rescue
43:37 anyone who's stranded in a foreign world
43:39 or country okay by the way this obey
43:44 shirt is they live it's not shepard
43:48 fairey who stole it
43:49 thank you John Carpenter even though you
43:53 were an [ __ ] two maybe three so they
43:56 are establishing a relationship with
43:58 these beings be they good or bad or and
44:00 different and we don't have information
44:02 to our commander in chief I think that's
44:05 a problem it allows people on the
44:07 internet to demonize these folks when
44:09 they're not bad people
44:11 I think that's [ __ ] I think that's
44:14 reprehensible no human on this earth is
44:18 better than another human being this
44:21 world doesn't belong to any one human
44:23 being more than it belongs to someone
44:24 else
44:25 despite the queen of England's real
44:28 estate holdings right this is our world
44:31 together if aliens have landed on this
44:34 planet that is information that every
44:37 single human being has the right to know
44:38 despite or in spite of what they might
44:41 do as a reaction to it now we can choose
44:44 as a as a race as a human race to
44:47 protect that being from crazy nut bags
44:49 in Topeka Kansas we want to kill
44:51 everything that's different than their
44:53 inbred single tooth heritage right I
44:55 don't think there's a lot of those folks
44:57 out there how many how many decades /
45:00 centuries are we going to go or where we
45:02 write books make
45:03 movies and television shows about
45:04 meeting aliens before we all come
45:07 together and say look we are not going
45:10 to freak out meeting an alien regardless
45:12 of how horrible they might be what their
45:14 intent is I doubt that there isn't an
45:16 ark left in the field of Stelling
45:20 stories about aliens but hasn't been
45:22 entirely covered by their conspiracy
45:25 theories television or movie right let
45:27 alone books and radio right it's all
45:30 been done we have analyzed everything
45:32 that they could be about from horrific
45:36 bugs that crawl the world and destroy
45:37 everything like alien or something or
45:40 what does it Starship Troopers that kind
45:44 of [ __ ] or the monolith that shows up
45:47 and prehistoric man and teaches us how
45:49 to use a bone as a weapon and to eat
45:51 meat to make our brains bigger and our
45:53 visual cortex is more accurate right
45:55 it's time that I think we start having
46:01 the conversation where you take away all
46:02 these stories about hybrids all this
46:05 stuff that what is it dr. Jacobs comes
46:07 up with that they're infiltrating us
46:08 coexisting with us intermingling with
46:11 our DNA yeah okay maybe that's occurring
46:13 that's fine that's that's other story
46:16 arc that's been explored but I doubt
46:20 since 1947 that those creatures that
46:23 landed here accidentally it seems have
46:26 evolved like they're different they're
46:29 physically different right yeah maybe
46:31 they've hybrid stuff together right bill
46:33 Cooper said that he saw vehicles going
46:36 into the ocean first I think vehicles
46:37 coming out of the ocean a vehicle going
46:39 into the ocean I think in like 1967 or
46:42 something like that and he got immediate
46:45 cue clearance and he was in there for 20
46:48 years and they came out and said man I
46:49 don't know I know what I saw I didn't
46:51 see any creatures but someone's flying
46:54 these things and they have super
46:56 advanced technology they're hiding in
46:57 the ocean which is a great place to hide
46:59 you think's he got a bunch of disks
47:03 information inside the military what I
47:06 find it fascinating is let's say go to
47:08 Google and turn up shirts on grey aliens
47:10 maybe grey alien autopsy or real photo
47:13 of a grey alien and you click images and
47:15 you
47:16 see just thousands of images of gray
47:18 aliens what's really funny to me as it's
47:23 quite possible that a few of those
47:25 photographs are real but they've been
47:28 leaked out by the military or leaked out
47:29 by someone and they're picked up and
47:31 copied and posted a hundred times but
47:33 military doesn't have any or whoever
47:35 this group is deep Staters or whatever
47:37 they don't have any worries it's like
47:41 well you can't prove that's real it is
47:42 real but you can't prove it and you
47:44 don't have any implications of what
47:45 they're doing in society right so I
47:50 think that's fascinating but as I
47:53 rewatched all the Roswell crash stuff
47:55 the other day it hit me differently than
47:59 its ever hit me in the past which is
48:01 holy [ __ ] these things are real they got
48:04 here they seem to make spacecraft out of
48:07 three different materials very very
48:10 interesting what does that do to my
48:12 heart and my soul right it's exciting
48:17 it's super exciting it kicks off that
48:19 huge frontier from my brain I'm sure
48:22 yours as well and some of you guys been
48:24 chasing this for 40 years but it kicks
48:26 off this notion of god damn it why can't
48:29 we find out any information about these
48:31 folks and why do I have to rely on
48:33 project disclosure stuff right why don't
48:36 have to rely on folks that wrote books
48:38 about it who are profiting from what
48:41 potentially could be an embellished self
48:43 manufactured story based on some real
48:45 facts isn't it interesting that when you
48:48 watch politicians they can only seem to
48:51 at least the bad politicians the ones
48:53 that are really stupid they can only
48:56 ever dupe folks that are stupider than
48:58 they are I say stupid very specifically
49:00 well the assumption is is that everyone
49:02 who runs all these deep Intel deep state
49:05 organization things are smarter than we
49:10 are
49:10 that perhaps they are smarter than the
49:12 average Joe now smart is two different
49:14 things right
49:15 jeopardy ain't smart jeopardy is just
49:17 your ability to memorize and repeat crap
49:19 on TV it has nothing to do with
49:22 deduction mathematics there is you know
49:25 theory development and that kind of
49:27 stuff perhaps some of the guests on that
49:29 show
49:29 those capabilities but that's not what's
49:31 being tested Alec Trebek definitely
49:36 regards himself as one of these smarter
49:38 human beings on planet Earth and one of
49:39 the most intellectual I think the guy
49:41 speaks like seven languages but again
49:43 that's not making him dumb or anything
49:45 but it's definitely just he has a really
49:48 good memory he's very good very adept
49:49 with foreign language assimilation so
49:54 he's you know he's got his he got it he
49:56 has his own game it's awesome but in
49:59 terms of individuals that work in
50:00 military organizations or Intel
50:02 organizations you have to be a person he
50:04 was evaluated against being able to
50:07 think for yourself very few folks at the
50:09 tippy top of the para Meridian stone on
50:11 this pyramid are capable of ever
50:13 thinking for themselves and they're
50:15 actually tasked with thinking for
50:17 themselves we need you to be autonomous
50:19 think for yourself Special Forces Delta
50:21 Force these are all guys that can do it
50:23 without anyone telling them what to do
50:26 very few of those folks write very
50:28 expensive assets so who puts the
50:31 lockdown on this information who would
50:33 do that
50:34 well information is power right as the
50:41 computer zero said in the 1975 movie
50:44 rollerball when Jonathan he was trying
50:46 to get some answers about who makes
50:47 executive decisions the computer said in
50:50 the middle of its self-destruction
50:53 diatribe it said knowledge is power we
50:59 all know that okay so you covet some
51:03 knowledge that makes you powerful that
51:05 makes you special you got one person
51:09 that probably wants to keep it secret
51:11 because that makes them special in their
51:13 own mind when they go to bed right
51:15 alright if that guy just happens to be
51:20 in charge and we have a bunch of folks
51:22 that grab the tail the person in front
51:24 of them in the organization they're used
51:26 to being compartmentalize perhaps they
51:27 do have fears of the unknown and that's
51:30 why they take orders really well because
51:32 they're like well mommy and daddy will
51:34 tell me what to do in this organization
51:36 that's what I have to have happen before
51:38 I feel secure enough to go to bed at
51:39 night right
51:41 all right so imagine the most amazing
51:48 coveted information in the world is
51:49 hidden behind those kind of people the
51:52 guy out front that'll shoot you if you
51:54 try to walk in the area 51 when he's
51:56 like a thousand times that kind of
51:58 person he's excited to talk his gun and
52:02 point it at you that's you made his day
52:04 you made his year oh my god you know I
52:05 got to I got to pointed my gun at son
52:08 when mommy really mm-hmm
52:11 why did you do that son cuz they say
52:15 import danger inside oh good for you
52:20 feel free I raised a really good boy one
52:24 thing Tim Burton did great in Mars
52:26 attack was the development of the
52:27 character Jack Black the actor Jack
52:31 Black I forgot what his fictitional name
52:32 was in the movie but he was a dude who
52:35 was in this sort of inbred trailer
52:37 family and he was just wanting to join
52:40 the military and as soon as the aliens
52:42 landed he got this job to protect the
52:44 summit between the aliens and the humans
52:46 and of course all hell breaks loose he
52:48 gets killed just like that boom
52:51 interesting right according to Bob Lazar
52:54 they actually do fly these vehicles and
52:56 operate them at night at area 51 he
52:58 brought John Lear there with his wife at
53:01 the time and they got caught by the
53:02 camel guys and of course they can't kill
53:06 anybody
53:07 John works there he knows everything
53:09 about them supposedly and John layers a
53:11 little too famous to to get murdered s4
53:16 supposedly you know where they keep them
53:18 now I think is interesting is I haven't
53:21 seen any Google Maps videos about s4
53:24 I've seen plenty about area 51 you know
53:26 and I'm gonna do an episode on that this
53:28 year apparently it was a place where
53:31 they tested hundreds of nuclear bombs so
53:34 if you look at area 51 on Google Maps
53:36 you still see the craters I think just
53:39 northeast of the base all over the place
53:42 now they may have smooth that out since
53:44 I saw that maybe I was looking at old
53:46 stuff but it's a very interesting place
53:49 definitely definitely exists it was
53:51 denied in its existence for a very very
53:53 long time
53:54 it changes the game if they really exist
53:57 it really does it doesn't get rid of God
54:01 at all
54:03 I don't maybe Jesus Christ but it
54:06 definitely doesn't get rid of God just
54:09 one more player in the game that's all I
54:11 want to stress that before I did my deep
54:14 dive into Roswell I want to stress that
54:19 before I personally took the deep dive
54:20 into Roswell and start listening to
54:22 folks that I believed to be telling the
54:24 truth that I have no motivation to lie
54:26 they're too old to hang on to all these
54:30 fictitional faction if you told a big
54:32 lie when you were I don't know in your
54:34 20s be really really hard to tell that
54:37 lie again without embellishment more
54:38 offering more details as you got older
54:40 then that'd be funny right I mean that
54:43 the details of like okay I think I would
54:46 you know I was having this emotion I
54:47 figured out you know a thousand more
54:49 words since I was 25 so I can now
54:52 articulate better about what I was going
54:54 through and what I think my mom and my
54:55 dad were going through that's cool but
54:57 to say all the sudden you know my father
54:59 said it was a UFO when I you know when I
55:01 initially told the story thirty years
55:03 ago he didn't say it was a UFO I don't
55:05 find that those problems in the hundreds
55:08 of interviews that they've done the
55:11 mortician
55:12 I read that before I watched his
55:15 interviews I read about the guy and the
55:18 dissenters about him and this whole
55:21 thing being real said he changed his
55:23 story a ton of times over the years I'm
55:26 like okay this is gonna be fun because
55:28 my episode was to prove that it had been
55:30 changed that it is a bunch of [ __ ]
55:32 and when I watched all of his interviews
55:35 which was probably about four really
55:37 good-sized interviews over the years
55:39 that dude is ironclad
55:41 he didn't change anything his deductions
55:45 about what he thought might have
55:46 happened developed a little bit but not
55:49 much I think maybe at the very beginning
55:52 maybe he feared that his friend got
55:54 murdered in England on this exercise
55:57 then later on he thinks it through and
56:00 he's like well maybe they just you know
56:01 got her off the grid obviously it's a
56:04 big deal if they're real huge deal
56:08 we as the citizens of this planet
56:11 deserve to know why they came who they
56:15 were you know it could be there's very
56:20 little information except for where they
56:21 are physically in the universe for those
56:24 of you who are flattered if yours
56:25 imagine we uncover some interviews with
56:30 this being which I don't know if
56:31 whatever would really speak but maybe
56:33 someone's translating the the you know
56:36 the telepathic communication or whatever
56:38 that we can trust maybe is there video I
56:41 think almost I haven't seen any videos
56:43 of these beings that I think is real
56:46 there's all kinds of beautiful CG stuff
56:48 that's done I haven't seen any things
56:50 that's realistic now there are some
56:52 photographs that I think that could be
56:55 real you know they're always taken
56:57 anytime the greys are taken in a real
56:59 ominous way that makes them evil-looking
57:01 gone that doesn't get into my brain but
57:05 what if they told you is flat earthers
57:07 you know you're we're round this world's
57:09 round all of them around we've been to
57:11 most of them this isn't what you think
57:13 it is but it's round that changes your
57:16 world right if they explain why is the
57:19 moon so huge why are crater is always
57:21 perfectly round and they say yeah well
57:26 your moon isn't what you think it was
57:29 those aren't craters falling stars on
57:31 what you think they are they start
57:33 explaining some things to us well what's
57:35 gonna happen it's gonna start taking
57:37 away power from universities that at one
57:41 point in time did their best to explain
57:43 the universe but then after a while had
57:46 more and more ignorant professors come
57:48 in that didn't want to do anything but
57:51 you know use their degree from when
57:52 they're frickin thirty years old or PhD
57:55 they get when they're thirty they want
57:56 to hang on to that knowledge until
57:58 they're 70 and 80 years old so we're
58:00 stuck in the [ __ ] past not being able
58:03 to get past stupid theories of the
58:05 universe we've had you know again like I
58:08 always say ether has been deprecated out
58:10 of the entire equation of why things do
58:12 what they do but there was that article
58:13 that recently I posted on Facebook page
58:16 that says yeah the pyramids can conduct
58:20 electricity
58:21 Wow I've finally figured that out but if
58:25 there's a safe way to travel that they
58:26 could just straight-up explain I find it
58:30 interesting that they supposedly
58:32 you know have three creatures two of
58:34 them died one of them lives with us for
58:37 however many years and probably I don't
58:39 know expires
58:40 who knows maybe they lived to be a
58:41 thousand years old I don't know what
58:44 this creature would eat that's the thing
58:46 but supposedly
58:48 we have access to this being but Bob
58:51 Lazar was needed to reverse engineer
58:53 antimatter engines at s4 so if that's
58:58 true which I'm not convinced that's true
59:00 but if it's true
59:01 then we never got that guy to tell us
59:03 how to travel through space how'd it go
59:06 back to where they're from if you think
59:09 about it our astronauts are really smart
59:11 guys and gals regardless if it's fake or
59:14 whatever they're not stupid they know
59:16 how to fly things right half of them are
59:18 ex pilots right probably less than half
59:20 now but anyway they could not build an
59:24 f-18 right they don't know how to build
59:28 rocket engines and you know turbine
59:32 engines and all that stuff they just use
59:33 those mechanisms to get around and
59:36 they're the best pilots so screecher
59:39 potentially didn't know exactly how
59:42 everything worked but the thing that I
59:45 find hard to believe with Bob Lazar
59:48 story is that he in his last interviews
59:51 were he was lamenting about how they
59:55 were speculating that these were
59:56 antimatter engines well you would have
59:59 to speculate if you caught one of our
60:02 f-18 pilots or RF what is it the Raptor
60:04 pilots or whatever in some foreign world
60:06 and they you know there's no animosity
60:09 we're not enemies he flew to another
60:11 planet he flew outside the dome and
60:13 landed on one of these islands that are
60:15 supposedly out there he's being treated
60:17 well and he's a little freaked out and
60:19 they're like what is this thing you
60:21 landed in you know we've never seen one
60:22 of these before and he's like ah well
60:24 it's a space it's a it's an aircraft so
60:26 spacecraft it's an aircraft and those
60:28 things on the side use a fuel that's the
60:32 stuff that's in the ground that you're
60:34 using for candle
60:35 you can refine that stuff and it turns
60:36 into a high octane fuel and it goes into
60:38 this pipe here in bah-bah-bah
60:40 I don't know exactly how all this works
60:41 but you can look at it you can reverse
60:43 engineer it if you're smart enough but
60:45 these provide thrust and the wings are
60:47 shaped in a way that cuts through air to
60:48 create a negative pressure straight up
60:49 and the fuselage bob-bob weapons all
60:52 this their stuff he could at least
60:53 explain it to a captor in the
60:58 theoretical way to help get us way down
61:00 the line when I imagine you're a grey
61:03 your spaceship blew up for some reason
61:06 some mechanical malfunction they're
61:09 still hanging on to the radar theory
61:10 it's just funny as hell we hit it with
61:12 the radar and it blew up oh really what
61:15 else can we hit with the radar and make
61:17 it explode oh nothing okay
61:19 yeah directed-energy weapons are a
61:21 little bit different than radar okay but
61:26 it blows up and it lands you know you
61:27 know they survive one of them survives
61:29 out of three now he says to myself don't
61:32 worry no one's coming and I have taken I
61:35 have accepted the fact that I'm stuck
61:36 here on your world if I have a wife and
61:39 kids friends I will never see them again
61:41 that's a pretty hefty thing to accept
61:44 don't you think all right
61:47 what if our top military guys said we'll
61:52 work with us work with us generally
61:56 describe what this alloys made out of
61:58 what's this plastic do they got the ship
62:01 they can just look at the other half of
62:03 the ship that's not blowing up and
62:04 probably reverse engineer the at least
62:06 on a piece of paper what the other half
62:08 would look like had it not exploded
62:10 right and say okay well isn't there a
62:14 way we can help you repair your ship
62:17 maybe the engines got tossed around I
62:19 don't know would seem that if if they
62:23 didn't have inertial dampers or
62:24 something they would have died just
62:25 simply on impact they would have went
62:27 splat right according to everyone who
62:29 saw the three aliens they said that one
62:32 was really burned up so there's a fire
62:34 some thermal moment happened that
62:37 consumed his body really badly his buddy
62:40 had injuries of which they have never
62:42 really describes them the bruises and
62:45 broken bones or is it fire I mean
62:48 we have to reverse engineer what
62:49 happened what are the hazards of this
62:50 vehicle you know can't we rebuild his
62:54 vehicle and say look how long does it
62:58 take to get home what do you guys eat
63:03 can you make oxygen on this thing
63:06 can you at least take a message home for
63:09 us maybe we say oh it's probably best we
63:12 don't let them know where we are because
63:14 they might come back with an armada to
63:16 change our world but why is bob lazar so
63:20 mystified about how these vehicles work
63:21 and do they have a bunch of different
63:22 propulsion systems if he's telling the
63:24 truth
63:25 nine vehicles nine one runs on rubber
63:27 bands and propellers and one runs on you
63:29 know Pez I'm thinking they probably have
63:35 a very similar mechanism of travel the
63:37 United States of America has its Air
63:39 Force runs on a particular bunch of
63:41 Declassified fuels and we now think that
63:44 they're using other ether abased engines
63:46 well the Russians probably have the same
63:48 thing
63:48 maybe we leaked it to the Russians maybe
63:50 they just figured it out for themselves
63:51 this is a natural progression of of
63:53 knowledge right this is where it gets
63:56 fascinating to me I don't think we
63:58 logically put things together I think
64:02 the things that I mentioned in last 15
64:04 minutes are things that I have never
64:05 seen on a sci-fi channel interview it's
64:08 all about perpetuating the myth and
64:09 perpetuating things that will sell the
64:11 television show a book a bumper sticker
64:13 but never anything it's like for us as
64:16 human beings with the notion that there
64:19 was at one point creatures from another
64:22 planet that made contact with us both
64:26 contact with average citizens in contact
64:28 with our special people I mentioned it
64:31 once before I'm one of my aliens
64:32 episodes but you have Stanley Kubrick
64:37 made a movie called dr. Strangelove as
64:40 well as the twilight zone called to
64:43 serve man and all the military people in
64:45 the room we're immediately you know will
64:48 knock him out of the air with nukes will
64:49 kill them will destroy them they're
64:51 invaders they're bad bad bad bad bad
64:52 before any intel has been gathered those
64:54 are fictional portrayals of military it
64:57 is my dire hope that we have some
65:02 people in command who are for the people
65:05 who are capable capable of thinking
65:12 rationally thinking for themselves and
65:16 simply saying they may not say it in
65:20 front of their CEOs their commanding
65:22 officers and say I'm gonna leak this
65:24 [ __ ] it's going out the door but I think
65:27 it is fascinating that if anything's
65:30 been leaked we are unaware of it other
65:32 than testimonies of people who saw
65:34 things right that has been leaked out
65:36 what we need is a physical piece of
65:39 proof piece of the i-beam piece of the
65:41 plastic piece of the metal my physics
65:43 teacher said that we can analyze these
65:45 things for their quantum frequency and
65:47 figure out that they are not from this
65:50 planet because all of our stuff vibrates
65:52 at a at a unified vibration or at least
65:55 within a Sigma 5 designation that says
65:58 this is all from here we have between
66:00 this frequency and that frequency on the
66:01 FM radio
66:02 it says earth right 106.5 to 106.7
66:06 that's earth great 88.5 well that's
66:09 that's Alpha Centauri right just some
66:12 food for thought people if you haven't
66:15 please go back and watch just watch
66:18 let's go to youtube and much where it
66:22 says Roswell witnesses and there's
66:25 actually a channel that unfortunately
66:27 debuts all of their videos with this
66:29 evil looking alien faces like their
66:32 bumper that's fine it's just some decal
66:35 that is their brand he or she or
66:38 whoever's putting that channel together
66:39 it's done a good job resurrecting a
66:41 bunch of these hotel interviews with the
66:43 people that were there sci-fi channel I
66:46 believe has the interview with the
66:48 person who did the bridge game if you go
66:51 back to my Roswell episode I just
66:52 recently clicked through some of the
66:54 links that I put down there
66:55 unfortunately the top two that I put in
66:58 the description which I don't remember
67:01 exactly which interviews those were but
67:04 that channel has been removed
67:06 isn't that interesting you know I can
67:08 understand an Alex Jones disappearing
67:10 the next day because of all is wild
67:13 crazy stuff accusations towards human
67:15 beings
67:16 but someone putting up an interview
67:18 about Roswell maybe a copyright strike
67:22 or something gets rid of the channel not
67:23 sure but these interviews are done by
67:26 organizations that want the information
67:28 out to MUFON and a bunch of other ones
67:30 right so do some research definitely try
67:36 to find the housewives and the kids who
67:40 watch their parents say look you know
67:42 this stuff was real now I will preface
67:45 one interview that I saw a one sort of
67:49 deathbed confession that I heard where
67:51 the individual was terrified of what he
67:54 saw and I think I remember if I remember
67:57 it right he told his kids I think there
68:01 was a son and a daughter because there's
68:02 enough there's a different son and a
68:03 daughter
68:03 they give really good interviews where
68:07 the son was able to get his father to
68:08 say things there in their workshop you
68:10 know like little covert conversations
68:13 but the daughter of the same family said
68:15 that her father admitted to her that
68:17 they were real as he was being loaded
68:18 into an ambulance and he died at the
68:20 hospital that night I think this was a
68:23 hospice confession and he basically said
68:27 they're creatures and they're terrifying
68:31 now that just probably means to me based
68:34 on all the other eyewitness claims but
68:38 he was personally terrified of what he
68:40 saw he is that group of people that
68:42 would panic if they saw an alien you
68:46 know I think we could probably say
68:48 safely that if you had a dwarf from like
68:52 Dungeons & Dragons or the Tolkien series
68:55 right burly not not what we would call
68:59 Worf in this world but a burly smaller
69:01 stout human being or what I'm sorry Worf
69:05 being or whatever that if we saw that
69:07 walk into Disneyland everyone would be
69:11 like whoa what the hell is that you know
69:13 all the Renaissance Fair folks would be
69:16 rushing up for autographs and you know
69:18 you're evangelical Christians would
69:20 probably run the other way
69:22 saying that you know I don't know the
69:23 Earth's coming and let the undone in the
69:25 next you know the the Second Coming is
69:26 here right
69:27 anyway so that's your first episode of
69:30 season 4 hope you dug it it's hard to
69:33 get all the juice out of the stuff but
69:34 it's the deductions for me that are
69:36 haven't been made before the connections
69:38 if this than that and if that not this
69:41 that for me is the rich rich fabric of
69:45 this discussion that is yet to be had
69:46 right I think you feel me if you haven't
69:52 been to deep thoughts radio calm please
