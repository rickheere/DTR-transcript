00:00 [Music]
00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts on this
00:36 beautiful summer day it is 80 plus
00:39 degrees out and let me just tell you
00:41 folks it has been a long time since
00:43 we've had any local warming it's so
00:46 funny and we're so fortunate they picked
00:48 this time of the century to try and
00:51 convince people the global warming was
00:53 real
00:53 right before the mini ice age what a
00:55 bunch of dumb [ __ ] swear to Christ but
00:58 today we're gonna talk about some other
01:00 things we're going to talk about NASA
01:03 coming clean because it's an extremely
01:05 interesting topic we want them to come
01:09 clean a lot of us thinks that think that
01:12 people need to be put in jail for lying
01:15 their entire lives some of us might
01:19 agree on some immunity for those that
01:21 have been forced by other agencies of
01:25 their alphabet agencies where their life
01:26 has been threatened their children have
01:28 been threatened their pensions have been
01:29 threatened etc etc I mean we look the
01:33 other way when financial informants who
01:37 have destroyed you know hundreds of
01:39 thousands of lives by stealing pensions
01:41 dealing 401ks we look the other way when
01:43 they they go scot-free
01:46 so I think we owe it to at least the
01:49 astronauts you know if we found out that
01:52 an astronaut was participating in the
01:54 hoax and really submitting their minds
01:59 their sorry their knowledge base in
02:02 order to further the hoax then perhaps
02:03 their immunity is limited in some
02:06 fashion but for those that were just you
02:09 know like a Gus Grissom that we're
02:10 trying to blow the whistle or someone
02:11 who was like Neil Armstrong it was very
02:15 religious didn't want to go meet his
02:16 creator having lied the entire time
02:19 maybe there's full immunity for those
02:21 folks but think about it let's say you
02:24 work at a convenience store and there is
02:26 an item that was right by the counter
02:30 right by the front door and it was there
02:33 you turned around you kind of heard
02:35 someone come in you thought they were
02:37 gonna stay and you turned around and the
02:39 items gone it's not a mystery they just
02:43 grabbed it you were looking the wrong
02:44 way you shouldn't put it on the counter
02:46 whatever
02:48 some random stranger took it doesn't
02:49 really matter you wanna you want to
02:51 catch them and you want to prosecute
02:52 them because they took your item now if
02:57 you worked at a target and you were deep
03:00 inside the store on the back wall and
03:01 you work an electronics you and you turn
03:03 around and there's that 70 inch
03:05 television you've been trying to pawn
03:06 off for the last year you turn around to
03:08 help someone 60 seconds later turn back
03:10 and the TV's gone then you have a
03:15 mystery on your hand you have a David
03:16 Copperfield moment you're like how in
03:18 the hell even if two guys came in to
03:20 grab it how could they have grabbed it
03:22 so quickly they got a mystery on your
03:24 hands you want to find the criminals
03:26 that took the TV but you want to find
03:28 out how the hell they did it so you can
03:29 put interrupter zhh in there to make
03:31 sure that it can't be done easily again
03:33 that day in September of 2001 we kind of
03:38 know the end result of what happened the
03:40 you know the towers came down a bunch of
03:43 other stuff happened it greenlit a war
03:46 in the Middle East it erased the
03:49 Constitution of the United States we got
03:52 to see who was a deep stator and who was
03:54 a true patriot anyone for touching the
03:58 Constitution was not a patriot those who
04:01 stood next to it and tried to blow the
04:04 whistle well they're the true patriot
04:07 but we need to figure out how they did
04:10 what they did how did they wire these
04:11 buildings to to be imploded basic
04:14 physics will tell anybody the pancake
04:16 theory is ridiculous as one floor hits
04:18 another floor there is a split second
04:20 insert of time as the resistance of the
04:23 previous floor pushes back and 110
04:26 floors you're going to have more and
04:28 more and more resistance with two impact
04:31 floors that are literally built to
04:33 resist the previous floors above it so
04:37 the building was designed not to
04:38 collapse period it was two and a half
04:43 inch glass will never in the history of
04:46 man glass resist 228 thousand pound
04:52 titanium rolls-royce engines but that's
04:54 what happened on that day and those
04:57 engines supposedly bounced off the glass
04:59 and then just weren't present only one
05:01 teeny
05:02 engine so small that a group of men
05:04 could carry it out like a casket to get
05:07 rid of the evidence very important it's
05:10 all [ __ ] the moon missions are
05:13 [ __ ] all these Rovers everywhere
05:16 [ __ ] but in this episode what we're
05:19 going to do is try to analyze the
05:21 logistics the PR the technology the the
05:25 political implications the pride
05:28 implications around the world of NASA
05:30 coming clean
05:31 I mean seriously we are sitting here and
05:34 as a community online and our goal is to
05:37 pound a 10-inch Tenpenny nail excuse me
05:40 right into the eyeball of all these NASA
05:44 people right that's sort of the analogy
05:46 of us complaining and complaining and
05:48 complaining and I had a really good
05:50 friend of mine I told the story a long
05:52 time ago when I was in the software
05:53 industry we had a newcomer I was one of
05:57 the founding you know I'm not the LLC
06:01 founding member but I was the first in
06:03 the first 20 employees and in terms of
06:07 development there was only like five
06:08 people helping the founder develop and I
06:10 was like the sixth somewhere in there
06:12 but I've been there for two years I had
06:14 you know contributed a gigantic portion
06:19 of the DNA I mean in terms of the guy
06:20 that programmed the product the next
06:22 person down that contributed unique DNA
06:25 I would say I was either second or third
06:27 I set this up for a very specific reason
06:30 because two years later we wanted to
06:32 port it to the Windows platform we'd
06:34 already ported it before this guy came
06:37 in but the code was not that great and
06:40 this guy was an expert so he's gonna
06:42 come in and speed up our Windows version
06:44 of the product and he had a huge pile of
06:50 problems he had to fix and he did fix
06:52 them he was amazing but he heard me
06:54 complaining about the product in general
06:56 this is irrespective of his
06:58 participation it wouldn't have anything
07:00 to do with his performance but he got
07:02 angry and he thought I was just some
07:03 punk-ass kid
07:04 some young like support guy or something
07:07 complaining about the product and so he
07:09 put out this this word to my boss I
07:12 can't stand this kid all he does is
07:13 complain and my boss
07:16 laughing is he's like man you have no
07:17 idea who you're talking about he's like
07:19 this kid made a gigantic part of the
07:21 product he is there to help you he does
07:25 submit the fix strategies but he's
07:28 unaware about how to do what you do so
07:31 he's excited about you being here and so
07:33 finally I go into his cube and he goes
07:34 man I thought you were just a pain in
07:35 the ass because I didn't realize you
07:37 were you know one of us you look so
07:40 young it doesn't seem like that's
07:41 possible and so he I'm a real good
07:43 friends but this is what we're doing we
07:46 instead of complaining about this I made
07:49 an episode about replacing NASA that's a
07:51 little bit different tense that is as if
07:53 some magical wand fixed the [ __ ]
07:56 problem that we have and then we move on
07:58 to create another agency and I will
08:00 remind listeners that up within the
08:02 month month and a half
08:04 max helped me sing replacing NASA Donald
08:09 Trump came out with space force let's
08:11 talk about manifest destiny men so how
08:14 do you logistical e breakdown such a
08:15 massive conquest well I think that the
08:20 first question is we have to figure out
08:21 what NASA means and what it means to the
08:27 world what it means to the United States
08:28 of America what it means financially in
08:30 terms of just economic health within the
08:33 world and what it means to us as a
08:34 public relations organization do we have
08:39 clandestine room space projects that
08:41 it's maintaining that are below the skin
08:44 it's a multi prong multi-layered
08:47 endeavor so if we wanted to come clean
08:51 we have to come clean on a level that
08:53 all those that are the highest level of
08:58 adversaries against NASA are satiated
09:01 that they have seen what they need to
09:04 see that reparations have been paid
09:07 these morally maybe some of it
09:10 financially all the way down to the
09:13 person that it believes up to that point
09:16 of coming clean that we did go to the
09:18 moon that we're have Rovers on Mars etc
09:21 etc then we have this sort of world
09:24 history problem because we will have
09:25 admitted that the United States of
09:27 America absolutely did not go to
09:29 the moon--and and that is just so
09:32 massive at this point in history
09:35 now imagine just fast forward five
09:37 hundred years and the kids are sitting
09:39 there going you know there's gonna be
09:42 there is going to be some sort of
09:44 catchphrase invented for the United
09:46 States of America similar to the
09:48 catchphrase that was pasted on to the
09:51 Native Americans Native Americans were
09:53 accused of two things that never that
09:56 weren't their ideas initially one was
09:58 scalping human beings the white man's
10:01 scalped the Native Americans how do we
10:05 know that well white men are typically
10:06 bald and there's nothing to grab ahold
10:08 of but you can grab ahold of a beautiful
10:10 mane of a Native American and be a total
10:12 jerk right and scalp him so they ended
10:14 up returning the favor the other one was
10:16 that when we showed up supposedly in the
10:18 1500s we didn't bring what we needed to
10:21 be here because we just didn't know the
10:23 environment they loaned us blankets they
10:24 loaned us all the supplies strategic
10:28 resources to survive and then eventually
10:31 they wanted it back and then we called
10:33 them Indian givers all right there's
10:36 gonna be a phrase like that for the
10:37 United States of America now what's
10:40 beautiful is we now have probably lured
10:41 in China we've lured in Israel Russia
10:45 has its own fibs and so maybe through
10:50 distributed distributed coming clean
10:54 strategy or way be we come clean in such
10:57 a technique in such a way that's so
11:00 clear and so easy but all the other
11:02 countries are immediately caught because
11:03 the same instrumentalities are used
11:05 against them and then there's not a lot
11:08 of name-calling but who gives a [ __ ] if
11:11 I lied to you every episode of deep
11:14 thoughts then I deserve whatever
11:15 name-calling I I earned from the public
11:20 right which is why I choose not to do
11:22 that so geez which area did we go for
11:25 first I think the very first thing I
11:28 would analyze is the economic impact of
11:31 pulling 22 billion dollars out of the
11:35 however many thousand employees are
11:37 inside the NASA apparatus obviously the
11:40 very best strategy
11:43 it's like a worst way to say that
11:44 obviously the best strategy qualified
11:46 qualifier is to simply repurpose the
11:51 objective and come clean in a way that
11:53 is if you come clean you become this
11:57 ESOP fable don't you you become the boy
11:59 that calls wolf so you would have to
12:02 absolutely liquidate everyone at the top
12:06 and in technically speaking prove to the
12:10 public that they simply inherited this
12:12 project from the 60s and 70s with all
12:15 these lies in place forced to carry the
12:18 lies fort so we don't necessarily need
12:21 to scarlet letter these individuals out
12:23 of working ever again but we perhaps
12:28 would not invite them to work in the
12:31 space agency and they would always be a
12:34 little bit marked that they were capable
12:36 of holding a lie every single day I know
12:40 some of you will want to put everybody
12:42 in jail it would just get extremely
12:44 messy at that point and you know if you
12:48 think that these people should go to
12:49 jail right away I would simply say you
12:53 may lack the empathy or the capability
12:56 to put yourself in a situation where you
12:59 are trapped into the lie and I'll give
13:02 you an example that I give people and no
13:04 one thinks this thing through the
13:05 example I'm about to give you I have
13:07 never heard ever repeated on YouTube I
13:10 think this is an original epiphany of
13:12 this show which is it has to do with a
13:15 satanic kind of sort of Eyes Wide Shut
13:17 rituals that occur out there so you're
13:21 this good guy you're this good girl good
13:24 lady whatever woman and you show up to
13:27 this party your friends invited you
13:29 unbeknownst to you it is a nice white
13:32 shut party that you keep going deeper
13:33 and deeper in this mansion you go
13:35 downstairs downstairs and you find
13:37 yourself at a [ __ ] weird-ass dungeon
13:39 room and it's intriguing it's it's
13:41 history you're looking at the room going
13:42 wow someone actually built this like
13:44 dungeon down here it's just like wow
13:45 what was this used for just asking
13:47 questions and then a bunch of people
13:49 come in they give you this mask and they
13:51 give you a robe and you're like oh wow
13:53 what's this this is kind of like you
13:54 know Eyes Wide Shut
13:57 but unbeknownst to you a child's Bart
14:00 into the room and they're put on an
14:01 altar the kid is not happy the kid is
14:05 screaming the kid is crying then this
14:08 crazy bastard comes up and starts you
14:10 know singing this Yale University
14:12 skullenbones druid [ __ ] [ __ ]
14:16 stabs his kids brought john podesta or
14:18 brother tony or both of them and they're
14:21 just killing this kid bloods coming out
14:25 of the kid it's going down some crazy
14:27 sculpture and it's falling into four
14:29 goblets and the four goblets are then
14:32 brought up into the crowd which is a
14:34 nice circle around this ritual and it
14:37 starts going in some clockwise fashion
14:39 until everyone in this room is given the
14:42 opportunity to partake of the blood of
14:44 this poor kid and you were down there
14:46 and let's just say you're not gonna
14:49 completely [ __ ] yourself when this
14:50 happens here comes the Goblet up to your
14:53 mouth I mean it's being given to you
14:56 split that way and they're like oh that
14:57 drink you've seen everybody doing this
14:58 and we make sure you're one of the last
15:00 and the rotations so that you've got ten
15:03 examples or fifteen examples before you
15:05 see it done four times fifteen or
15:08 whatever or five or whatever however big
15:11 this room is and you now have this
15:14 moment a big grown-up moment you know
15:20 that if you go if you were to scream and
15:23 run out of that room you're dead maybe
15:26 you have a wife or a husband you got two
15:28 kids maybe you have kids old enough that
15:31 they have kids you're in this goddamn
15:34 basement because you needed to star [ __ ]
15:36 somebody you needed to be with rich
15:37 people and now you have this goblet in
15:41 front of you and if you don't drink it
15:42 you're dead and you don't know how far
15:46 it's gonna go if you don't drink it do
15:47 they kill your whole family obviously
15:49 this would be some palacios place where
15:52 you've got Rothschild money and so your
15:55 big heroic arc of I'm gonna tell them
15:58 you know [ __ ] you all we'll do what you
15:59 tell me it ain't gonna happen because
16:02 you've surrendered yourself through your
16:04 own ego into this paradigm of money
16:09 worship or status
16:10 per class structure worship sort of just
16:12 being a human being well that's the
16:15 problem with these individuals like the
16:18 astronauts like the people that inherit
16:20 these organizations I mean just think
16:22 about it 1972 was the last time we
16:26 claimed to have gone to the moon well if
16:28 the person was there was a human being
16:29 in the I States of America was born in
16:31 1972 well now they be about 48 years old
16:36 all right 47 48 they take over NASA they
16:42 you know they study really hard they get
16:43 the economics the aerospace technology
16:46 in their brain they do really well and
16:48 they take over NASA and this ritual
16:50 happens to them not necessarily the
16:53 blood ritual but this idea that you
16:54 pulled into a boardroom and it's like we
16:56 are gonna now tell you information and
16:58 after this point this this chronological
17:00 line in the sand after this point if you
17:03 resist us we're gonna [ __ ] kill you
17:04 and your family so are you you on board
17:09 you're [ __ ] you're already on the
17:11 other side of this membrane that you
17:14 can't come back from I give you that
17:16 example so you guys can all calm down
17:17 with this you know and maybe I've even
17:21 violated my own code here but I do
17:24 believe that they're issues that we
17:26 would have to deal with in the immunity
17:29 process of carrying something that you
17:33 inherit forward now if you had an
17:36 opportunity to clear the air and do this
17:38 sort of thing and you chose to stay
17:40 inside the darkness that's a little bit
17:41 different but I don't think that that's
17:43 something that happens in the NASA
17:45 organization space exploration is
17:49 important if we are really inside of a
17:52 heliocentric model of the universe the
17:56 Milky Way and stars and all that good
17:58 stuff planets out there in our solar
18:00 system a bunch of galaxies out there
18:02 potentially other members of other
18:04 planets out there we don't want to throw
18:07 away every single person who has no idea
18:10 that this is not a scam or this is a
18:13 scam right we want to keep that mind
18:16 share by simply dividing up and trying
18:20 to figure out okay if you're over this
18:21 level of management then you've had to
18:23 have participated in the
18:24 folks hopefully it's so
18:27 compartmentalized and hopefully there is
18:30 enough real research and real stuff
18:31 being launched into space albeit maybe
18:34 for an alphabet agency or the government
18:36 or the military or something like that
18:37 they're being keep these people and not
18:39 worry about them and their integrity
18:41 hopefully it's just this thin layer at
18:43 the top historically that has always
18:45 been the case so financially someone is
18:48 going to have to figure out two things
18:51 what are we doing in NASA that is legit
18:54 and you and I can't answer that question
18:56 we don't know obviously Mars missions
18:58 I'm gonna tell you right now I don't
19:00 give a [ __ ] about Mars once the moon has
19:03 figured out I could start giving a [ __ ]
19:04 about Mars right now I would pull the
19:07 plug on every single thing up there just
19:10 pull the plug if there really are Rovers
19:12 I still wouldn't talk to them just pull
19:14 the plug on them there's nothing going
19:17 on up there of any value the moon is is
19:20 probably difficult to rationalize
19:25 spending money on but it's the nearest
19:27 object we have in space but again for
19:30 those of you who believe Project Blue
19:31 Beam and all that stuff ok fine we prove
19:34 it doesn't exist it's just a projection
19:35 that are not fine you're gonna get your
19:38 way too so don't even worry about it
19:39 I'm not gonna go down that path on this
19:42 particular episode so just as a as a
19:48 Nishal step I would create you know a
19:52 model over here which is the styrofoam
19:54 model of what NASA is today that's a
19:57 metaphor for those of you trying to get
19:59 you literal on this and on the right
20:00 side I would create a new agency perhaps
20:03 space force perhaps something else
20:05 independent but space force is fine with
20:07 me
20:08 and we're gonna have to figure out a
20:10 diagram all the compartments over here
20:13 this this top-down mastaba of NASA for
20:17 any compartment in the NASA realm that
20:22 is clean and in without deception you
20:25 can immediately be picked up and put
20:28 over into space force as well as the
20:31 bottom-line budget the business unit
20:35 budget the pl
20:37 / as well and we're gonna do that we're
20:40 gonna carry things over now there's
20:43 going to be probably compartments that
20:45 are have a minor level of of treason and
20:50 Sedition in them right and so we're
20:53 gonna have to have almost like a you
20:56 know a radiation bathing area in the
20:59 middle where we bring it to the center
21:00 and we disassemble it and we look at it
21:02 and we go okay well this is actually a
21:04 fairly legit compartment but there's a
21:06 PL thing here where we we routinely buy
21:09 toilet seats for twenty thousand dollars
21:11 a pop so this needs to come off and we
21:15 need to acknowledge that to the public
21:17 that this particular agency was you know
21:22 being victimized into some black op
21:26 thing but we need to comfortably write
21:30 down and be able to explain to the
21:32 public everyone within this compartment
21:34 had no idea that this was being added to
21:36 their piano so as we clean it off they
21:39 become clean move them over space for us
21:41 it's gonna be hard to speculate some of
21:45 this because we don't know after this
21:48 sifting occurs there's going to be a
21:50 pile of compartments departments and
21:54 money PL budgets they're going to be
21:58 completely sludgy black you know
22:02 prometheus news that it's going to be
22:06 either impossible to clean up and then
22:09 we have the individuals that participate
22:11 in that financial sludge in that
22:14 scientific hoax sludge and so that's
22:20 going to be the toughest toxic dump to
22:22 clean up perhaps then that is all lined
22:25 up for the the PR blitz that will have
22:29 to do the public to say okay these
22:30 organizations were pure deep state we're
22:32 going to blame it on the alphabet
22:34 agencies we're gonna grab a bunch of
22:37 people who are totally guilty of other
22:41 things they would they would have you
22:44 know they would have served life
22:47 sentences and perhaps killed Gitmo for
22:50 other things
22:51 we're just gonna put it on their backs
22:53 now if we just have black op projects
22:56 and there's a distinction here that's
22:59 one of the things that has to come clean
23:01 in the United States of America is
23:02 simply to say we have black budget
23:04 projects we do a public we got black
23:06 budget projects what are those well
23:09 those are technology tracks within the
23:13 cut within the country that build things
23:17 like the u2 the sr-71 the aurora that
23:21 weird space shuttle that goes up that
23:23 doesn't have any passengers in it we're
23:25 doing these things so that we can build
23:27 mechanisms to interrupt World War 3 to
23:31 figure out you know if we were ever to
23:34 come clean that Roswell was real and
23:36 that we actually do have alien neighbors
23:37 then I think that would open up a
23:40 tremendous budget and what's really
23:43 stupid I mean it just depends I mean
23:45 again I went in to disprove Roswell and
23:48 came out a complete believer and believe
23:50 me that ain't easy for me if the
23:53 government would simply say we have made
23:56 contact with aliens on these occasions
23:59 we've had them in captivity on these
24:01 occasions here are the photographs of
24:03 them there would be no problem funding
24:06 black ops [ __ ] forever but it would
24:08 wouldn't probably have to be black but
24:11 they hoard technology because we have a
24:14 petrodollar system so if we were able
24:16 figure out like I always say
24:17 anti-gravity systems they don't want us
24:20 to have that because then we wouldn't
24:21 buy oil there for our fake money
24:23 wouldn't have any value system demand
24:26 would go down it's all [ __ ] because
24:29 you can always figure out a way to
24:31 create a value structure in something
24:33 then anyway we've got to deal with this
24:36 full cleanup we would probably have to
24:39 hire psychologists psychiatrists various
24:46 therapists to handle maybe even full-on
24:51 general practitioners to figure out
24:53 what's going to happen when grandma
24:55 finds out we didn't go to the moon or
24:57 grandpa some people might just have a
25:00 goddamn heart attack because you know
25:03 let me give you an extreme example
25:05 to family members I'm making this up to
25:07 family members have disputed it out that
25:10 the munitions were real or fake one one
25:12 group believes it was real one group
25:14 believes it was fake as the Aussie man
25:17 said one guy says [ __ ] you know [ __ ] you
25:19 know [ __ ] you goes back and forth and
25:21 then one of them dies in fact the guy
25:24 that believes it was a hoax dies and the
25:26 guy that thinks it was real lives and
25:29 then NASA comes out 10 20 years later
25:31 and says yeah by the way we didn't go to
25:33 the moon and then that guy has it it
25:36 dies of cardiac arrest dies of a broken
25:39 heart dies of a stroke because he
25:41 realizes oh my god I wasted whatever
25:44 remaining years I have with this
25:45 relative who wrong a government Prussian
25:51 education system because it made me feel
25:54 patriotic I thought I was supporting my
25:58 country and I just lost 10 years with
26:01 perhaps his son perhaps his brother
26:03 perhaps his father he let it get to that
26:07 level well there's probably a lot of
26:10 that there's gonna be a lot of that I
26:13 know in my own family I don't know a
26:15 single person within my family who
26:17 thinks the moon missions were faked not
26:20 a one I also don't know a single one of
26:23 them it's done [ __ ] microsecond or a
26:25 nanosecond of research in it it's
26:28 hilarious but what's gonna happen to my
26:32 parents world who feels like they have
26:34 to toe official stories on everything
26:37 otherwise I don't know what's gonna
26:39 happen I if I can truth will consume
26:41 them or something right but that is the
26:43 huge psychological layer we're gonna
26:44 have to lean on the greatest minds in
26:46 our country to figure out scenarios
26:49 we're probably going to have to
26:52 beta-test hundreds of people bringing
26:56 them inside government buildings and
26:58 saying you know just explaining it to
27:01 them and saying look we need you to sign
27:02 this non-disclosure it's only gonna last
27:05 two years or how many years we think
27:07 we're gonna need to clean this mess up
27:08 maybe five years just to pretend five
27:10 years or when we tell you otherwise
27:12 right so it's almost like a warranty in
27:13 a car you know it's either every 15,000
27:16 miles or one year they'll be
27:18 sit them down and we carefully test the
27:22 methodologies of explaining it to them
27:24 we we tell them in a one track we say
27:26 how would you feel if you were told the
27:29 moon hoaxes were fake and we watch and
27:31 we listen and we look at the Democrat
27:33 demographics the male's the females the
27:35 different ages for every decade you know
27:37 from 10 to 20 20 30 30 40 etc the baby
27:42 boomers the guys that are still alive
27:44 may have been inside World War two you
27:47 know how does this affect them those
27:49 that are religious those that are
27:51 atheists those with technical
27:53 backgrounds those with no technical
27:55 backgrounds the housewife the guy that
27:56 worked his ass off his whole life both
28:00 worked their ass off their whole life
28:01 but you know I'm sorry you know what I'm
28:03 saying here
28:03 your schoolteacher based on the results
28:07 of those and peer achill tests we have
28:09 to be able to come up with the best
28:10 possible strategy like like a campaign
28:14 I got excuse me like a political
28:15 campaign ideally speaking to go back to
28:19 the financial bucket for just a split
28:21 second here we're dealing with about
28:22 twenty one point nine billion dollars a
28:24 year just going into the NASA
28:25 organization at sixty million dollars a
28:27 day all right we have to figure out a
28:31 way to maintain just for the sake of the
28:33 health of the economy of the United
28:34 States of America all those employees
28:37 and the same PL the same payroll all
28:41 that stuff you have to figure out what
28:44 percentage there's going to be
28:46 absolutely erased and reapplied
28:48 someplace else now twenty two billion
28:52 dollars for United States of America is
28:53 Italy squat money
28:55 it is truly nothing when it comes to the
28:58 kind of money that we spend you and I
29:02 want to preface this with saying we're
29:03 not going to have any huge financial
29:04 problems because the President of the
29:06 United States whoever that is could
29:10 easily sign an executive order that
29:13 would reallocate another 20 billion
29:18 start a completely different agency so
29:20 let's just say we're able to scrap 20
29:22 out of the 22 billion into a brand new
29:25 organization space force but the
29:27 president could come in and say I'm
29:28 going to double the employees I'm going
29:31 to subsidize aerospace
29:32 education kids from you know
29:34 kindergarten up are gonna learn physics
29:38 trigonometry geometry every single thing
29:41 Euclidean mathematics we're gonna
29:42 everything so that we have tons of
29:46 brilliant kids to fill these roles if
29:50 you think about it a kid who's 15 14 to
29:53 15 years old he's going into high school
29:56 which is now usually ninth grade here in
29:58 the United States if you simply said hey
30:00 are you interested in this program well
30:01 we'll pay for your college but the the
30:04 stipulation is right here inside high
30:07 school you're gonna have to roll in this
30:08 track you have to take physics all this
30:11 mathematics it's it's strana me
30:14 cosmology whatever we got access to at
30:17 that school and then we'll pay for a
30:19 four-year to a tenure to get you your
30:22 PhD we could start right away put money
30:26 into all the institutions that would
30:28 make this happen for us but when things
30:31 happen and change happens it freaks the
30:33 crap out of people which is why I would
30:35 want this to be as smooth as possible
30:37 now let's go to the cleanup of all of
30:42 the claims that were made by NASA from
30:46 its inception to the day that this
30:49 occurs there have been lies after lies
30:52 after lies we would need an a
30:58 independent believable group of people
31:01 and if I were the United States of
31:04 America government I would solicit
31:07 probably people like myself
31:09 jaren ISM mark sergeant Hall these
31:13 people that have some credibility and
31:17 with the listeners you know again some
31:20 of these people are some of these people
31:22 like again sergeant has been accused of
31:24 being a shill because he just seems to
31:26 have a [ __ ] ton of money to run around
31:29 with flat earth I have no opinion on the
31:30 subject just you know but you know what
31:33 I'm talking about youtubers who aren't
31:35 these you know silly Mythbusters right
31:39 Mythbusters is a complete [ __ ] silly
31:42 show it is there to propagate lies into
31:46 the mine
31:46 people Neil deGrasse Tyson shill he gets
31:49 paid to lie Neil was a Bill Nye the
31:54 douchebag guy the guy who's a [ __ ]
31:56 civil engineer actor pretending to be a
31:59 cosmologists pretending to be a
32:00 physicist pretending to be all this crap
32:02 it's all written for him and he
32:04 regurgitates it he tells your child that
32:07 when they look down they don't know what
32:09 gender they are so they can't be trusted
32:11 they can't be a part of this
32:12 organization they have to be outed but
32:16 we need to take people into whatever
32:18 surviving evidence that we have to
32:22 explain to them exactly how these frauds
32:25 took place with the death of Gus Grissom
32:28 and his two counterparts on the tarmac
32:32 of the Apollo 1 we need to figure out
32:35 exactly the human beings that determined
32:38 when he said the week before this thing
32:40 is a lemon and it's never going to be
32:42 it's never getting to the moon we need
32:44 to isolate exactly the people that
32:47 greenlit his murder we need to come
32:50 clean with the cyanide poisoning the
32:52 toggle switch that's been replaced the
32:54 day before the way he was murdered we
32:56 have to come clean but every single
33:00 thing inside NASA that was faked has to
33:07 be exposed if there is still a set
33:09 somewhere which there there obviously
33:11 probably isn't but if there are somehow
33:15 memorabilia that these people took
33:17 around you know let me keep that one
33:19 thing because I doubt that ever occurred
33:21 because just like Kubrick getting rid
33:22 all his stuff a 2001 to make sure people
33:24 didn't replicate things and again a lot
33:27 of that has been over exaggerated
33:28 there's a Kubrick exhibit that goes
33:30 around the world there's a lot of lies
33:32 where they tell you that say everybody
33:35 was murdered at a particular location
33:37 but goddamn there sure are a lot of
33:38 survivors [ __ ] hilarious so whatever's
33:41 left how we can improve that this
33:43 occurred imagine going from a person
33:47 that has really had acidic angst from
33:51 hanging on to the lie worried about
33:54 being murdered ready about their kids
33:56 being murdered worried about the money
33:58 being taken away and their kids dying in
33:59 some
34:00 [ __ ] being able to come out and not
34:03 only get it off your chest but to live
34:09 in the light that is the repair process
34:12 say Buzz Aldrin you didn't go to the
34:15 moon we know you didn't go the moon you
34:17 admitted it right to bart sibrel in the
34:19 back of the bookstore if you show us
34:21 anybody I'll sue you
34:22 oh really the legitimate evidence that
34:25 you took pictures of the earth through a
34:27 portal window and Apollo 11 if we show
34:30 that to anybody you'll sue Bart why
34:32 would you do that I mean if someone
34:34 stole my home [ __ ] videos of me
34:36 chilling out at a pool and I didn't show
34:38 my wiener
34:39 yeah go ahead [ __ ] show it to the
34:41 world I'll [ __ ] care it's what really
34:43 happened in the backyard of my uncle's
34:44 house when I was at his pool big deal
34:47 but if I was lying and I was the woman
34:50 next to me is not my wife or my
34:53 girlfriend and it's gonna expose the
34:54 fact that I'm a cheater then I might say
34:57 I'll sue you it's private property bah
34:58 bah bah buzz never went now may be
35:01 buzzes so 10 sheets to the wind with
35:04 dementia and Alzheimer's is uh
35:06 beta-amyloid czar all plucked out in his
35:09 brain he doesn't know but there's plenty
35:11 of astronauts to do plenty of NASA
35:14 employees that do okay it's going to be
35:17 a different tone if we do it right if
35:19 the probe if the public relations blitz
35:22 is done correctly we have a ton of
35:23 documentaries created by people like us
35:25 going in there and just busting their
35:28 balls in a polite way of course because
35:31 again the odds that we're going to be
35:33 talking to someone across the table that
35:35 is actually the first degree participant
35:38 of the moon hoax is pretty pretty rare
35:41 and again the big misnomer about any
35:44 hoax is that there are tens of thousands
35:46 of people involved in the hoax right it
35:49 I mean if you're saying I just can't
35:53 believe the moon hoax is real because
35:55 think of that means like ten thousand
35:56 people would have to be involved or
35:58 thousands of people have to be it's like
35:59 you're dumb you're dumb you're not smart
36:02 that is not a [ __ ] intellectual smart
36:04 question to ask because you don't know
36:06 jack all about compartmentalization what
36:11 were people seeing at these three
36:13 radio towers supposedly listening to the
36:16 Apollo 11 mission they're looking at
36:18 transmissions coming in do you think
36:20 they have anything to do with the hoax
36:22 why would they all those people that
36:24 that you know Houston Mission Control
36:27 what are they doing they're sitting
36:28 there looking at monitors puking out
36:30 numbers what do they know nothing
36:33 there's a few administration people at
36:36 the top and a bunch of CIA people
36:37 pulling this crap off and of course the
36:40 astronauts have to be involved in which
36:41 is why they looked so [ __ ] depressed
36:44 at their press conference they had lied
36:47 to the American people and they were
36:48 just sure it was a countdown until they
36:51 got caught as all the missions were over
36:53 in decades past they feel absolutely
36:55 hubris that no one's ever gonna find out
36:58 but eventually mr. astronaut
37:01 you're gonna meet God and that's when
37:04 you're gonna be a [ __ ] horse's ass so
37:07 you've got a chance if you're not dead
37:08 yet to clean up your act and if an
37:11 astronaut was murdered up in Ojai
37:14 because he told his buddies he was gonna
37:15 come clean at the 40th anniversary and
37:18 guess what he met his god not a horse's
37:21 ass he was murdered because he was going
37:24 to tell the truth that's the way to go
37:26 out guys
37:27 that's the way to go out and there's no
37:30 reason why you can't hold a press
37:32 conference and do a live stream on
37:35 YouTube a live stream on Facebook you
37:37 can do them at the same time you could
37:39 bring 20 cameras 20 different channels
37:41 to YouTube and Facebook and broadcasted
37:45 all over the [ __ ] world and no one
37:46 can come after you no one can come after
37:49 you you'd be free and clear and you
37:51 would clean up this entire planet
37:53 because there's a catch and we're gonna
37:56 go into this the last part we're not
37:57 quite there yet but there's a catch once
37:59 NASA goes clean everything gets to coke
38:01 go clean if he went on is real his next
38:06 endeavor would be to come clean
38:09 everything's got to come clean again
38:11 doesn't mean you don't have black ops
38:12 projects doesn't mean we don't develop
38:14 technology to protect ourselves or
38:16 create again interrupters for world wars
38:18 their acts of terror so what do we have
38:22 so far let's recap we do a gigantic
38:25 budgetary analysis of the various
38:27 compartments
38:27 of NASA and all related departments GPL
38:30 spinoff stuff
38:31 SpaceX spinoff stuff in the thousands of
38:35 companies that are attached and we
38:38 reassign it to a new agency probably
38:40 space force but something that's going
38:42 to have the sort of integrity by design
38:48 meaning there's so many checks and
38:50 balances there's so much transparency
38:52 that one's moved into this organization
38:53 you have a bunch of you know microscopes
38:56 and telescopes on you so that we can
38:58 always see what you're doing who you are
39:01 as an individual that becomes public
39:03 record just like when you become the
39:04 president United States a ton of
39:06 information about you becomes public
39:08 when your company goes public everyone's
39:11 salaries are published to the world you
39:13 want to find out what the CEO of Disney
39:15 makes just go look it up next up we have
39:18 the the sociological and psychological
39:24 experimentation to find out how the
39:26 human mind at this day and age and this
39:28 is a twenty and twenty twenty era would
39:32 wake up and handle this epiphany how are
39:36 they gonna handle it we're gonna be
39:37 joyous they're gonna be crying in their
39:40 beer well people double down on religion
39:42 will people get rid of religion will
39:44 they distrust their government or trust
39:47 them more I mean I would hope that if
39:49 someone comes clean you can trust them
39:51 more can't you especially if you install
39:54 checks and balances to make sure that
39:56 lying is very difficult moving forward
39:59 we don't want to lose the momentum of
40:01 the space program so we need to develop
40:04 a technique to double down and maybe
40:06 triple down a quadruple down on the
40:08 educational requirements to actually
40:10 accomplish what NASA was supposed to be
40:12 doing again start science education at
40:17 the second a child can look at a picture
40:20 and speak about it as when you start
40:23 introducing them to scientific theory
40:25 and what we've actually figured out of
40:29 course we think that there's a lot of
40:30 lies coming out of them about a lot of
40:32 things and again if you're a flat
40:35 earther this might be a little painful
40:37 to listen to because you're like dude
40:38 there's no [ __ ] you know plan
40:40 there's no planets there's no this
40:44 amount another thing well hey if that's
40:46 the case then Jesus even more reason to
40:50 come clean about everything
40:51 the third stage so far is to then debut
40:55 dozens and dozens and dozens of
40:57 documentaries where normal human beings
40:59 like us have a chance to ask every
41:02 critical question about the projects
41:05 that have been forged you know there was
41:08 I want to digress for one second about
41:10 the Challenger conspiracy there is this
41:15 conspiracy out there that the astronauts
41:17 of the Challenger they blew up in
41:20 January 28th 1986 all survived except
41:23 for one guy that may have perished just
41:24 due to old age because he was one of the
41:26 older guys on the ship and that they
41:29 have actually found them all over the
41:30 United States of America a lot of them
41:32 are proxies to NASA one has his own
41:34 supposedly as a company that serves NASA
41:37 one is a huge advocate that woman that
41:39 was McCully Erika Lee Kogan knew the
41:44 schoolteacher chick that she is now a
41:47 professor that is a NASA advocate and so
41:50 there's these photographs of these
41:51 individuals aged on the web supposedly
41:55 three of them used the exact same name
41:57 as the as their previous incarnation so
42:01 it's as if the Space Shuttle never has
42:03 anyone in it this thing blew up oh my
42:05 god these families think their relatives
42:07 have died but they haven't died because
42:08 they're on the ground because the whole
42:09 thing is a bunch of [ __ ]
42:11 and which makes sense if the Space
42:13 Shuttle was faked you know then you do
42:16 just launch this thing into space no one
42:17 worries about it exploding because
42:19 everyone's gonna be okay until it
42:20 explodes and then you're like oh my god
42:22 how do we do this when the Space Shuttle
42:26 lands and people get out of it it's
42:27 because you put it on the back of a 747
42:29 you get it up there and then you do
42:32 something to it to make it go quickly so
42:33 it lands now I've seen the space shuttle
42:35 to take off with Sally Ride Christine
42:38 McAuliffe was the woman's name and I've
42:40 seen it laying in the desert I think it
42:42 was 1988 or 89 when I saw it laying in
42:46 the desert and I heard the sonic booms I
42:48 looked up the thing was upside down and
42:51 it did this crazy horseshoe
42:54 came in and landed there were no jet
42:59 sounds you know I don't remember the
43:01 escort I don't remember the f-16 escort
43:04 I remember that at all
43:06 when this note was we were out there
43:09 with 850,000 people but let's just say
43:13 that that okay so the the Challenger
43:16 hoax might be this that came out and it
43:20 circled the world I just come back from
43:22 Hawaii where I watched I looked at the
43:23 tombstone of the astronaut that died up
43:25 there that was from Hawaii but now what
43:29 have we had debuts since then we've had
43:31 this technology debuted that they can
43:34 make artificial intelligent generated
43:37 faces the big famous one is Barack Obama
43:40 they took one of his speeches that he
43:42 made and used all these photographs of
43:45 him from different ages and simulated
43:50 him giving the speech with all of the
43:52 idiosyncrasies of his face which sounds
43:56 super duper complicated and you know
43:57 it's probably more complicated for the
43:59 geometry programmers than it is for the
44:01 actual isolating muscle tissue things
44:03 recently on Facebook they have
44:06 encouraged everyone to give a 10-year
44:09 side-by-side example of them aging and
44:14 all the sheep went out and posted that
44:16 what that is is one Facebook is called
44:19 face book it is to put everyone in the
44:23 world inside of a fish face recognition
44:25 system well the 10-year aging thing is
44:30 to provide the artificial intelligence
44:32 computers of the deep state and and well
44:37 probably just the deep state to figure
44:39 out how a face ages now imagine that
44:42 technology existed 20 years ago and the
44:46 space shuttle survivor conspiracy theory
44:48 is nothing more than an artificial
44:50 intelligence taking a photograph from
44:52 before and Ageing it if you're a white
44:56 guy the algorithm goes a little faster
44:57 if you're Asian guy it goes a little
44:59 slower if you're a woman changes of your
45:01 man it changes and so they generate
45:04 these fake pictures put it out there
45:06 with a nice story about all the
45:08 people but no one's walked up and met
45:11 these people really whereas we are
45:14 change.org I think that guy would go out
45:17 and find him and say are you really the
45:20 twin brother of this astronaut I think I
45:24 was in a previous episodes I was a
45:26 little bit more on the side of believing
45:28 that conspiracy and now I feel sort of
45:30 like a dope
45:31 oh my god it was just the [ __ ] AI
45:34 thing brilliant
45:36 hook line and sinker man if these
45:39 individuals are alive then we should
45:41 have students sitting in their class
45:42 especially the Kristy McAuliffe lady
45:43 who's supposedly a professor at some
45:45 University on the East Coast I don't
45:47 even care if she's just available any
45:49 one of these people are available you
45:50 just you know you work with them get
45:52 your camera on your phone welcome to
45:53 them and go hey are you really the twin
45:55 brother of one of these astronauts from
45:57 the Challenger yeah and you have the
46:01 same name it's like the landfill from
46:02 [ __ ] beer fest it's hilarious not
46:06 have you just called me landfill it'll
46:07 keep it clear
46:08 suppose a brilliant character swap in
46:11 any movie I've ever seen so there has to
46:14 be credible resources that basically
46:16 debunk this entire thing there are a lot
46:18 of folks that probably participated in
46:20 the moon hoax that would love to come
46:21 out you know I don't really want to name
46:23 any names but there's some very famous
46:25 people and special effects that may have
46:28 participated that are still alive to
46:29 this day one of his initials DT maybe
46:33 maybe those individuals participated
46:36 some people are probably going to hang
46:38 on to the lie simply to make sure that
46:40 they don't have to ever go back to their
46:42 family and admit that they lied so we
46:45 need a whole separate track of the
46:47 psychology of this thing to make sure
46:48 that people who participated in this
46:51 have a chance well we provide the best
46:55 accepted story and that story hasn't
46:59 fake but reasoning why this occurred you
47:04 know sometimes people have anxiety about
47:05 things and and you just sit down with
47:08 them and say well there's no reason to
47:10 have an anxiety over that and they'll go
47:11 what do you mean well just get it this
47:13 way pop up up a bar and they go oh yeah
47:15 so you don't have an anxiety will go
47:17 home and tell that person what you think
47:18 now tell them a digit that you love them
47:20 that you believe in them and
47:21 so their stuff and they do it and their
47:24 life is better but in their mind they
47:25 hadn't taken the thought far enough
47:27 forward so if someone has lied to their
47:30 family for 50 years about him being
47:33 involved with the conspiracy it allows
47:37 them to to get out with a
47:39 get-out-of-jail-free card hopefully and
47:41 again if anybody loves you they're gonna
47:44 work with you it's just that simple
47:46 even if you're no longer in their world
47:49 you've divorced or something like that
47:50 in that case you may not even care
47:53 then there's the spin why did America
47:57 fake the moon landings well as I covered
48:01 in 165 extensively and with which blows
48:04 me away I had a 20 20 minute monologue
48:07 prior to actually getting to the
48:08 substance of sort of the wound evidence
48:11 2.0 in 165 and it is almost 30,000 views
48:15 at this point it's about 28,000 views
48:18 which just blows me away
48:19 I commend people listening to that but
48:23 we were supposedly and it did occur we
48:27 are bankrupting Russia by creating this
48:30 space war which was very abstract from
48:34 any Cold War objective any Cuban Missile
48:39 Crisis situation it was extremely costly
48:41 what did it cost to put missiles in Cuba
48:44 well jeez one they don't have to be real
48:47 they're just tubes that you put over
48:48 there just to threaten them but I mean
48:51 you had missiles you had missiles so big
48:53 deal you put them on a boat you smuggle
48:54 them over to Cuba you line them up you
48:56 put them outside so that you tube planes
48:58 could take pictures of them you freak
48:59 out the United States of America you
49:01 give a cause to keep a fake war going
49:03 we're probably high five and Khrushchev
49:06 in the background you know the banning
49:09 of Cuban cigars in America is probably
49:10 the biggest loss of that whole Cuban
49:13 Missile Crisis or of Castro you know
49:16 using the deep state to take over his
49:19 country and then flipping the bird it's
49:22 pretty funny when you just to digress
49:24 for a split second there so Cuba makes
49:26 cigars they make some of the best cigars
49:28 in the world if you know well if you
49:30 like that sort of thing if you don't
49:31 like necessarily completely bold tastes
49:33 all the time
49:34 and we provide I mean if we were to turn
49:36 on Cuban exports for cigars and you can
49:40 bring back about $800 worth of cigars
49:42 now on a single trip so we do have that
49:45 ability today so it's people get legal
49:47 Cuban cigars all the time now but you
49:50 know all of Europe has buy Cuban cigars
49:52 forever China buys Cuban cigars
49:55 the just we're nothing to their we're
49:59 not nothing but we're definitely they're
50:02 not hurting they can't keep up with
50:03 world demand as it exists today so this
50:06 this embargo against their tobacco is
50:09 just bad math it's really sad I think
50:13 the most logical spin to tell the rest
50:18 of the world and one we would have I I
50:22 really don't know how to discuss the
50:26 issue of dealing with Russia and their
50:30 stop animation forgeries of being in low
50:33 orbit I don't know how I'm proud they
50:37 are about it
50:38 of course they hold a lot of the records
50:40 Sputnik and you know the first animal
50:43 space first man in space for Ford first
50:46 double mission in space first woman in
50:48 space first space walks you know I
50:50 believe they have the spacewalk record
50:53 as well but whatever
50:55 I don't know how proud they are I think
50:58 they're very proud people they are just
51:01 getting on their feet in a really
51:02 amazing way over there I mean Moscow is
51:04 is like Rodeo Drive
51:07 except today it's the size of a gigantic
51:08 city it's literally a little Dubai with
51:12 a bad winter but sometimes you just got
51:14 to do what you got to do you come clean
51:17 and other people don't come clean so
51:18 what but we say look we take the tack of
51:21 this they say look the Cold War had gone
51:24 on for too long people were worried
51:26 about a nuclear holocaust and that
51:30 needed to end and so America did
51:32 whatever it needed to do to make it end
51:35 and quite technically historically 1972
51:40 ends the Apollo 17 mission Vietnam war
51:44 goes about two and a half more years
51:45 it's over
51:47 and then by 1976 we have the beginning
51:51 of one of the golden eras of the United
51:53 States of America between 1976 and the
51:57 invasion of Kuwait / Iraq
52:01 America was it in just my own analysis
52:06 of looking back now that we know that
52:07 the roaring 20s weren't were the
52:10 whirling 20s it looks like after World
52:13 War Two you have this baby boomer era
52:17 but it was shorter lived because the
52:19 Korean War / police maneuver right it
52:22 was a war but we didn't want to call it
52:24 that because that requires a lot of
52:25 congressional oversight we were inside
52:28 the duck-and-cover era people were
52:30 worried about the nuclear holocaust back
52:33 then so between 76 in about 1990 the
52:37 United States of America I can't speak
52:38 for other countries we were in an
52:40 unbelievably positive realm and even
52:43 after that with the deep state trying to
52:45 push you know Bart Simpson be a loser
52:48 that's cool
52:49 grunge music which was you know go to
52:51 [ __ ] thrift stores and buy all your
52:54 clothes so that the people that actually
52:55 need to buy thrift clothes have to buy
52:57 the worst options because the rich kids
53:01 came in and bought them and patted
53:03 themselves on the back I still kids are
53:05 still doing this to this day you know
53:08 it's like I guess it's a free market but
53:10 if if I were to run all these
53:12 organizations it would be you need some
53:15 sort of a you know EBT card like the
53:19 welfare card or something to come and
53:20 even shop in this place because you're
53:23 destitute you're a homeless person yeah
53:26 let's get you a suit so you can go get a
53:28 job instead the [ __ ] rich kid comes
53:30 in and buys all that clothing and I know
53:32 some [ __ ] totally rich kids rich
53:35 intellectual 180 IQ kids that go in and
53:37 they still can't figure out what they're
53:38 doing but the internet blew up HTTP
53:41 protocols dropped on the world in the
53:43 early 90s and so the internet took us
53:45 through the 90s up until that day in
53:48 September 11th so the spin might be look
53:51 this was a way to end this Cold War you
53:55 know they and they technically give the
53:57 Cold War a lifespan way into the Reagan
53:59 era
54:00 I wasn't worried about the Russians my
54:03 entire childhood and my teens which
54:06 would be the mid to late 70s all the way
54:08 through the 90s there nobody gave a [ __ ]
54:10 about that no one said in America going
54:12 oh my god hope I didn't get killed by an
54:14 you know an atomic bomb even with the
54:18 movie wargames with Matthew Broderick no
54:22 one worried it was fun it was a game it
54:25 was all over obviously we would need to
54:28 go to a think-tank or create a
54:31 think-tank for everyone participating in
54:35 this coming clean strategy all the most
54:38 brilliant minds in the United States of
54:40 America would have to go into some sort
54:42 of resort warehouse business building
54:46 complex and we would need to simulate
54:50 this over and over and over again
54:53 hiring groups to pretend to be the
54:55 public playing devil's advocate to
54:58 everything that we're trying to do to
54:59 quash them and they're gonna have to
55:01 simulate resistance we're gonna have to
55:04 have someone fake with in the think tank
55:09 fake headline news both the broadcast
55:14 headline news internet headline news
55:16 newspapers magazines everything we're
55:21 going to have to roleplay forward all of
55:23 the implications that might happen for
55:26 movies for television shows as they
55:29 integrate the script into their scripts
55:32 you know the coming clean script I hate
55:35 to say script because it sounds
55:37 fictional if script does not have to be
55:39 fictional but what's going to happen
55:41 there's going to be comedians that go
55:43 into nightclubs and they're gonna run
55:45 jokes which is going to be a very
55:47 healthy byproduct of this admission
55:50 because everyone's gonna need to laugh
55:52 as quickly as possible but here's
55:54 another thing that we have to make sure
55:56 that we would manifest in this I believe
55:58 just riffing okay there needs to be a
56:02 demarcation line between the past
56:05 methods and the present methods the
56:08 public has to be able to believe a
56:10 thousand percent and we have to do
56:12 whatever we can to make this the case
56:13 and if the grey
56:14 Awakening is real and Cuba's real and
56:16 Donald Trump's cue relationship is real
56:19 and we're getting rid of all the
56:20 pedophiles and deep Staters and 5i
56:22 organizations that must take place and
56:24 if they are smart they would grease the
56:27 skids on this because it will help their
56:29 efforts considerably but we have to
56:31 prove to the our local population of the
56:34 United States of America and the rest of
56:35 the world that beyond this point of
56:38 coming true it's no longer going to be
56:40 possible to lie like this because
56:42 there'll be checks and balances
56:43 installed in these locations and we have
56:46 to be cynical about those checks and
56:47 balances for the remainder of our
56:49 existence you know you have a guy watch
56:53 a guy and a girl watches the guy and a
56:55 girl watches a girl you know it's like
56:56 it's like it's it's one of these things
57:00 where no one can be trusted so we
57:01 constantly have to check each other
57:03 there are experts out there that can do
57:05 this that can create systems where no
57:08 one can lie but we say look those those
57:13 methods of managing a giant population
57:16 are over they were naive they were
57:18 deceptive they were sinful we don't do
57:21 that anymore
57:22 do we have secret blackout projects yes
57:25 what kind are they or they're in this
57:27 division that division in that division
57:29 our enemy knows so why the hell not tell
57:32 the public yes we have aviation blackout
57:34 projects what is the what is the goal of
57:36 app to create high speed supersonic
57:40 aircraft to be able to fly around the
57:43 world in split seconds to be able to
57:46 survey that our enemies slash partners
57:50 in the world I hate to say enemies okay
57:53 oh maybe I should read act that that our
57:56 partners on planet Earth are doing
57:58 exactly as they say they're not building
58:00 underground you know systems to develop
58:02 horrible weapons they're not amassing
58:04 troops on the borders blah blah blah
58:06 let's just all get along
58:08 goddamn go figure such a revolutionary
58:11 idea I would be interested at the end of
58:13 a think tank experiment to see how long
58:16 we think the residual effects of coming
58:18 clean would take how long is it going to
58:21 take for a baby boomer to accept
58:26 that it didn't happen I mean bart sibrel
58:28 talked about a professor he that he
58:30 interviewed and he said what if Buzz
58:31 Aldrin came out and said it was all fake
58:33 and he said I would still believe it
58:35 because I saw it on TV and I would think
58:36 buzz has simply gone into a state of
58:38 dementia Alzheimer's and he's lying that
58:43 is the way the mind works a cowardice
58:45 mind will do that it can't accept that
58:47 we didn't go so it hangs on and hangs on
58:51 what's interesting we recently had a
58:53 listener come through that was lecturing
58:55 me about the fact that we did go and
58:57 then I just need to watch a few
58:58 cognitive science videos and sort of
59:03 basic psychology videos to figure out
59:06 how I'm a denier that we did go he is
59:10 obviously not dealing with in the issues
59:12 he won't he won't take on any of the
59:14 specific smoking guns won't even
59:15 remotely attempt to take on the actual
59:17 issues but for him he retreated like a
59:20 coward into these other mechanisms to
59:23 say well that person must be broken
59:25 because of this and it's so easy for me
59:26 to believe everything that that but I'm
59:28 told and I'm gonna go to my grave a
59:31 sucker and as soon as there's truth
59:33 after death you realized you wasted your
59:37 life and if you ever convince anybody
59:40 that we went who was previously
59:42 skeptical you will find out that you did
59:45 harm to your fellow man you broke common
59:48 law because you were coward now let's go
59:53 to the next gear why wouldn't they do
59:57 this I mean I think I've made a pretty
60:00 basic case for this why wouldn't they do
60:03 this say I have for some reason I have a
60:07 mysterious connection with Donald Trump
60:10 I'm able to sit down with him and
60:11 private and I pitch this whole thing to
60:13 him or he's messing around on YouTube in
60:16 the middle of the night he finds his
60:17 video and he's like oh that's cool let's
60:18 watch this boom seems like he watched my
60:20 other video about creating a Space
60:21 Agency on the side but he gets to this
60:23 and he's like mmm that does sound pretty
60:26 good and it probably would help my
60:28 movement I wouldn't be fighting this
60:29 whole Q&R moving all by myself well once
60:32 the government admits that it has
60:34 clandestine projects that then go public
60:37 as a an official story moon mission
60:40 why and again gus grissom
60:44 gus grissom was murdered with his two
60:47 counterparts that's big news men and you
60:50 better believe they are just three of
60:51 the folks that we know were murdered
60:53 there had to have been more just like
60:56 the JFK witnesses murdered because they
60:59 knew more happens all the time
61:01 south rich anybody it creates what we
61:04 call a cascade doesn't it it becomes
61:08 this fast replicating virus of truth and
61:12 then everything has to come out now
61:14 doesn't it so you would have to have a
61:17 bunch of military individuals that have
61:20 a clean background I mean you don't
61:22 actually have to have that if they're
61:24 willing to repent and come clean as long
61:28 as you're not the guy that wrote the
61:30 plan to create these false flags then
61:34 you're probably okay there's a method
61:35 for you to get out free and clear
61:37 without being you know lynched by a
61:39 bunch of people but most people don't
61:41 live in you know there's there's very
61:43 few humans on earth that live inside
61:45 this bubble but to illustrate this very
61:48 specifically you and I live in a world
61:50 where we don't have death threats death
61:52 threats are extremely powerful for some
61:55 people one there they're free to do call
61:59 someone up leave a voicemail best you
62:03 know you put a thug on somebody's
62:05 property and they they manhandle you a
62:08 little bit and depending on how you
62:09 interpret that you [ __ ] yourself
62:12 literally and then you know you're
62:15 you're putty in their hands they kidnap
62:18 your kid okay that's control now if that
62:25 were to occur then you have this
62:27 mysterious force out there of which you
62:29 have no orientation to who is doing this
62:32 well people way more powerful than me
62:34 because they're willing to separate
62:35 themselves from money to put this person
62:38 on my doorstep to put this person
62:40 calling me you know Stanley Kubrick
62:43 pulled clockwork orange' out of
62:47 viewership in England because he got
62:49 death threats this is a public about our
62:51 public record someone really hated that
62:53 movie
62:54 and so he wasn't gonna play any game so
62:56 it could air everywhere else but not in
62:57 England so when it comes to individuals
63:00 being hesitant about be about coming
63:02 clean who knows what they've been told
63:04 and who knows what their constitution is
63:06 it could be a very strong-minded man or
63:09 woman in military and the sciences and
63:12 the politics and recently they haven't
63:15 had any in fact they may have never had
63:17 a true death threat someone who calls up
63:19 said now you're on my list it's just a
63:21 matter of time before you're taken out
63:23 but maybe way back at the inception and
63:26 involvement in this project they had the
63:30 very meticulously detailed consequences
63:33 outlined to them
63:35 Michael Rupert claims that he was
63:37 brought to Washington DC and recruited
63:40 by an alphabet agency to handle the drug
63:43 trafficking of that alphabet agency here
63:45 in the Los Angeles area he declined his
63:49 parents were in intelligence he was just
63:53 going to become a police officer here in
63:55 Los Angeles I think eventually got into
63:57 narcotics I think and eventually he just
64:02 saw the damage of that importation of
64:06 drugs into the ghettos to destroy
64:09 societies and the violence that it
64:10 caused all the drive-by shootings and
64:13 gang on gang violence and finally he
64:15 blew the whistle rest in peace he
64:19 eventually killed himself about four
64:21 years ago four or five years ago so
64:23 people may be still hanging on to a
64:24 previous experience a previous
64:26 commitment to keep the mouth shut the
64:29 government itself would have to put
64:31 resources behind these individuals to
64:33 ensure that those threats never became
64:35 true to prove to them well first
64:38 investigate who would maintain such a
64:41 contract on someone absolve them and
64:44 give them immunity for those that are
64:48 still hanging on to the deep state
64:49 agencies that might retaliate against
64:51 anyone who is true we have to take our
64:53 military our four-star generals and
64:57 assign them to finding these individuals
65:00 and eliminating them putting them in
65:03 jail for those that can't be put in jail
65:06 we have to
65:07 verse the algorithm on them set them
65:10 down and say you okay you're part of
65:13 this cabal that threatens individuals
65:14 for telling the truth well this truth is
65:16 coming out you're now on our list we're
65:21 gonna know where you are at all times in
65:23 history we will be listening to all your
65:25 phone calls or communications if you try
65:27 to leave behind a device we will still
65:29 hear you so you're now on the list do
65:33 you understand do you have any questions
65:35 good you're obsolete man by the way
65:40 that's the name of the episode and
65:42 Charlie's on his coop sleep man I got
65:44 that wrong an episode just released I
65:47 said obsolete no I could take a burgess
65:49 Meredith episode we have to make sure
65:52 that people who have the information
65:54 that we need feel safe but the Cascade
65:57 is going to spread into other areas
66:00 right now what's awesome about this
66:03 concept is that if we could ever pull
66:05 off the true disclosure of the moon
66:07 missions and all the other fake Space
66:09 Research we might find out a couple of
66:11 interesting things one some of this is
66:14 real we do have a Space Station let's
66:18 just say we have been to Europa the moon
66:20 of Jupiter we did put a satellite on the
66:25 Titan moon of Saturn how exciting would
66:28 that be if we really were able to say
66:30 yeah we legitimately do that these
66:31 people could go in front of press
66:32 conference and say yeah we really do do
66:35 that we don't have any Rovers on Mars
66:37 but maybe we have one reconnaissance
66:40 satellite on Mars you know circling Mars
66:42 but we have unable to release the data
66:43 because we faked the surface of the
66:45 surface of the planet Mars but here's
66:48 the real information how exciting would
66:50 that be and then all these people have
66:53 been trying to tell the truth forever
66:54 can now have their day in the light
66:58 they're 15 hours of fame but we have
67:02 other moments right we have moments
67:05 prior to the moon missions we have all
67:07 the assassinations of the 60s it is time
67:11 to come clear come clean excuse me it's
67:14 time to come clean who killed JFK here's
67:16 what I didn't know according to a video
67:19 I watched it broke down the actual
67:21 report that was recently Declassified
67:24 about the JFK assassination x' they're
67:26 now saying that the first shot that went
67:28 through Kennedy's throat was from the
67:29 the bridge which had the railroad tracks
67:32 on it there you go you can't have your
67:35 official story G or Lee Harvey Oswald is
67:38 not the dude big surprise I mean again
67:41 who is crapping themselves that matters
67:43 in the world anymore
67:44 so some 80 year old guy our 70 year old
67:47 guys like oh good it's not you know Lee
67:49 Harvey Oswald I've been wrong my whole
67:51 life okay well then you know toughen up
67:53 there snowflake but doesn't matter what
67:56 matters is our kids get to hear the
67:58 truth and it's a it's an era past was an
68:02 intelligence agency that got completely
68:05 out of [ __ ] control but what other
68:08 things would cascade the reasons why we
68:11 start wars it probably cascade down hmm
68:15 well we're in a process right now where
68:16 a president is pulling us out of as many
68:18 war theatres as possible yes there are
68:20 secret missions going on in Somalia and
68:22 a bunch of other things going on all
68:24 these planes falling out the sky
68:25 suddenly in training exercises the
68:30 inside word is that supposedly the
68:33 previous president gave away our
68:35 security communications codes and so
68:38 foreign agencies are actually able to
68:40 control our planes drill through and
68:42 find out where people are at any one
68:44 point in time Chinese company created a
68:47 bunch of cell phones that were listening
68:48 to soldiers in the fields and so they
68:50 were able to find out where all of our
68:51 forces were and that were and sell that
68:53 information to people that could hurt
68:55 them it's a war out there you know it's
68:58 always going on but when you keep
69:00 everything secret that no one can help
69:02 you how many sitcoms I've told you this
69:05 guy this in season one half a dozen
69:08 times what's the format of a 25-minute
69:10 sitcom a character in the sitcom does
69:13 something feel scared hides it they hide
69:17 it for 10 minutes takes it well takes
69:19 five minutes to create the I broke the
69:22 vase I mean it was a there was a Fresh
69:24 Prince of Bel Air or I think someone
69:27 broke a vase
69:28 I broke a light or some [ __ ] and then
69:30 they glued it back together or they hid
69:31 it and then they lied about it and then
69:33 for 10 minutes it's the stress of the
69:34 lie with
69:35 nice subplot that's not related to the
69:37 lamp breaking and the moral of this
69:39 story in the last five minutes is that
69:41 they revealed the fact they broke the
69:42 lamp and it's one of these things why
69:44 didn't you just tell me it's okay we
69:45 would just replace it accidents happen
69:47 that's the average archetype of a sitcom
69:50 okay so we have a bunch of people who
69:53 have lied okay we're okay we're growing
69:57 up so now we're so much more grown up we
69:59 have been in the middle of a terrorist
70:00 war for now almost 20 years based on a
70:03 crappy event that was also orchestrated
70:07 by these deep Staters by this these
70:09 alphabet agencies by the tiny smidgen
70:11 within those alphabet agencies we have a
70:14 human trafficking situation it's all
70:16 around the world I mean can you believe
70:20 at this point in 2019 we are fighting to
70:22 get Jeffrey Epstein's court hearing a
70:25 public videotaped court hearing so we
70:28 can hear the charges so we can hear the
70:30 evidence and you have the Democrats
70:32 sitting there the demon Kratz they're
70:34 sitting there trying to hide all that
70:35 stuff because that's that's their game
70:37 that's what they do
70:39 so what else would come out what else
70:43 would come out and military okay so we
70:47 know that again
70:48 the military's is in large part from
70:52 what I understand fairly immune at times
70:56 and conspiracies where people are
70:57 selling you know m16s to drug cartels
71:01 and they get bags of coke in return they
71:05 bring it back to the ghetto and they
71:06 sell it or like a thousand to ten
71:08 thousand percent profit all right it's
71:10 the fast and furious project down there
71:16 people inherited that Holder was one of
71:21 the guys under Obama that inherited that
71:22 program and we might be able to give
71:24 that guy a pass but then he walked
71:25 around against you know giving speeches
71:28 against the Constitution he was even
71:30 throwing his own people under the bus
71:31 and the blacks are like animals and all
71:33 this other stuff
71:34 weird men but that particular day in
71:39 2001
71:41 it's stinks to high heaven doesn't it
71:44 we have neocon organizations that helped
71:47 instigate that and plan it we have
71:49 Rosinski use thankfully no longer with
71:51 us who helped design it
71:54 those would most likely be the next
71:56 targets they're probably things going on
72:02 in this world we have nothing to do
72:03 nothing no knowledge of right let's just
72:05 say Roswell is a true event which seems
72:08 almost hard too hard to say publicly and
72:12 they did recover a little you know et
72:15 guy let's say they kept him alive for a
72:18 little while I mean there's all kinds of
72:19 news about that we're now learning the
72:22 Hitler went to Argentina at this point
72:25 he went to Argentina we got photographs
72:27 of him down there they've done
72:28 documentaries down in Argentina talking
72:30 to everyone who took care of him back in
72:31 the day he really went there sorry for
72:34 all of you who want to believe he bet as
72:36 cyanide cows one was burned up in his
72:38 cot in some bunker the visual evidence
72:41 of that body is absolutely non
72:44 conclusive he was burned beyond
72:46 recognition whoever that body was was
72:51 Ava was his girlfriend and they went
72:53 down there got married had a kid who
72:56 might be Angela Merkel who knows he dies
72:59 in the early 60s his wife dies in the
73:02 late 60s they lived a full life we're
73:06 figuring that out a tremendous amount of
73:09 history that is used to manipulate the
73:11 world sympathies into giving away things
73:13 for free are now being revised the I
73:17 mean there have been I'll just be as
73:19 abstract as possible but there are
73:21 plaques that were on monuments claiming
73:24 history went one way that have been
73:27 silently pulled down redone and replaced
73:30 so there's such that the facts are no
73:32 longer what they were but people still
73:33 regurgitate the facts as it was when the
73:35 plaque was originally put on there
73:36 scientific analyses of claims no longer
73:40 pan out other stuff would cascade out
73:43 but guess guess what once you figure out
73:46 a method to tell the truth and and let's
73:51 say we grease this machine everything I
73:52 talked about P&L statements being
73:54 repurposed the psychological analysis of
73:57 how humans would respond to the truth
73:59 the PR blitz
74:01 the spins all this stuff once you get
74:06 good at it you can do it over and over
74:07 and over again now some things just
74:10 simply happen on this planet that are
74:11 absolutely evil done by evil people you
74:15 know there are people that do get upset
74:17 and walk in and kill a bunch of people
74:18 it happens I realize that but then there
74:23 are events that are you know false flags
74:27 used to be nobody got killed and now
74:31 false flags are blood baths they figure
74:34 out a way to to really create horrible
74:38 loss and then try to manipulate things I
74:41 don't know about you but I want to live
74:43 in a world but we can tell the truth to
74:45 each other it's important as a human
74:48 being to be able to do that once you
74:51 start living in a fantasy land well then
74:53 geez how can you keep track of your life
74:57 you can't you can't rely on anything
75:02 people can manipulate your country into
75:04 horrible forms of your company country
75:07 excuse me
75:08 socialism which is an ending a polished
75:10 version of communism it's never worked
75:12 anywhere in the world ever ever ever
75:14 countries are going bankrupt with their
75:16 universal health care we have health
75:18 care health crises going on in this
75:20 world that needs to be exposed
75:24 you know Alzheimer's my god been doing
75:28 more research on this recently and it
75:29 you know the guy existed in like 1906
75:32 when he found it mr. Alzheimer's and it
75:35 was fairly rare back in the day and it
75:38 was fairly rare because we didn't have
75:39 obesity you know now we have this whole
75:42 movement or plus-size models and all
75:44 that kind of stuff now there are people
75:45 who are big and they're always going to
75:47 be big they're big-boned and they just
75:49 have that that that configuration of the
75:52 human body and that's that can be a very
75:54 beautiful thing but we have kids that
75:56 are have no such predisposition
75:59 genetically that are now like I can be
76:01 super fat and it's in if I any anyone
76:03 says hey man you know you sure you're
76:05 okay with all that [ __ ] you don't fat
76:06 Shamy
76:08 all right well universal health care
76:11 should require that an individual room
76:15 healthy because we're all sporting the
76:18 bill of this thing which is why you
76:20 don't want that we have so much sugar in
76:23 the diet of mankind that are you know
76:26 everyone's in some form of insulin shock
76:30 insulin carries your sugar into your
76:32 cells your glucose you too much of that
76:37 crap that there can't be enough insulin
76:39 created to carry it into your cells and
76:41 so then you get insulin shock it's all
76:43 floating around your body but we can't
76:46 be honest with anything right we have
76:48 agencies well we have incomplete
76:49 divisions of medicine that are complete
76:51 [ __ ] we have draconian techniques of
76:54 trying to cure cancer with with science
76:58 that hasn't been updated in a patent
77:00 form since 1989 which was a minor update
77:05 which is you know chemotherapy but you
77:08 have courts and various states in the
77:10 United States of America that if you
77:11 don't put your kid through chemotherapy
77:14 which will kill your child or your
77:16 spouse they will I mean absolute [ __ ]
77:21 Orwellian deep state draconian manner
77:26 force your family member to ingest a
77:28 toxic chemical which is known for
77:32 killing its patients huge ninety plus
77:35 percentile rate of killing its patients
77:38 instead of trying vitamin C and b-17
77:40 cutting out sugars and meats getting
77:44 cured you know again there's all kinds
77:47 of technique the Gershom technique
77:49 it's amazing how brilliant we were in
77:52 the first decade of the 20th century
77:56 between 1900 and 1910 we really had it
78:00 figured out and because we figured out
78:03 how to cure it evil people figured out
78:05 how to cause I think NASA can come clean
78:09 NASA's never going to come clean by
78:11 themselves they're gonna need to force
78:12 to become clean because they're
78:13 absolutely terrified of what will happen
78:15 to their spoils as the results of coming
78:18 clean hopefully this little exercise in
78:22 thought presents several plausible
78:27 possibilities to actually execute a full
78:30 disclosure moment I can only speak from
78:33 being a citizen of the United States of
78:35 America one of the reasons why I love it
78:37 when you guys comment from your
78:39 individual countries and I'm telling you
78:40 I just want to make a very big point
78:42 here every time I read a comment or
78:45 someone says I'm in the UK I'm in
78:48 Germany I'm in Finland I'm in Australia
78:51 and then you give an update like a very
78:54 intelligent update I've never read one
78:56 that wasn't intelligent so far but you
78:59 see here we have these problems and
79:01 they're kind of like your problems we
79:02 have other problems and maybe we got
79:04 this working really well but you don't
79:07 we do and but it's still kind of fragile
79:10 or whatever those comments are just
79:12 weighted platinum it's for me it is a
79:15 great way for us to be the news to
79:18 combine information as you enlighten me
79:20 at times I can bring that information
79:22 out from the United States of America
79:26 we are currently one of the richest
79:28 countries in the world we have trillions
79:31 of dollars that are collected every
79:33 single year in taxes and if we could
79:36 simply get on a track of telling the
79:39 truth Americans should never have to pay
79:42 for college but the college
79:44 organizations have to be completely
79:45 redone they do now it's a private
79:48 industry out there to educate
79:50 individuals but if we simply put some
79:52 mandates down to say look like I've said
79:55 in the past your degree has to be
79:58 connected to a actual job if your degree
80:01 does not attach to a job you must be
80:03 completely explicit with those that are
80:06 buying that degree as you buy the degree
80:09 and they say look you're gonna get us if
80:11 you're gonna go for your PhD in Chicano
80:13 Studies there's no job there's no job
80:17 hey knock yourself out it's a free world
80:18 but you better be a rich kid you better
80:21 be married to someone who can carry you
80:22 your whole life because you'll never be
80:24 a earner
80:25 someone who goes into broadcasting or
80:28 medicine or chemistry or whatever those
80:32 are meat-and-potato jobs you can get a
80:34 job once you get those degrees if
80:37 nothing else you can become a teacher
80:40 but you're teaching a trade skill kid
80:42 who learns chemistry or something is
80:43 going to be able to become something of
80:46 all kinds of different proportions you
80:48 can you could manufacture things and
80:49 know how plastics you know mutate during
80:52 the process of being created you could
80:54 do all kinds of stuff
80:55 maybe invent something brand new that
80:56 replaces something that we should get
80:58 rid of the money that we create needs to
81:00 be spent for the overall goal of a
81:04 particular country if let's say that
81:08 nuclear power is still creating a bunch
81:10 of really toxic water and a bunch of you
81:13 know uranium rods or what have you you
81:16 know some sort of toxic byproducts that
81:19 we have to bury in the ground for you
81:21 know 9 and 1/2 million years before it
81:23 starts to starts to become less
81:25 radioactive and we need other forms of
81:28 energy there's this huge debate about
81:30 the 5g cellphone networks the 5th
81:33 generation of all those cellphone
81:34 networks it's going to toxify the world
81:37 on a level that's crazy now they're
81:39 supposedly you know gonna release cures
81:41 to cancer here to counteract this
81:44 cellphone liability that's out there and
81:47 again for those that have created videos
81:48 debunking 5g networks you need to go and
81:52 watch all the town hall meetings where
81:54 scientists come in from both the medical
81:56 industry and the technical industry
81:58 saying look we have case studies and
82:01 clinical studies proving that this type
82:04 of agitation of the human body through
82:06 tight frequencies does cause cancer and
82:10 a bunch of other horrible things
82:11 diabetes is one of the byproducts of
82:14 electromagnetism on the human body it
82:18 interferes with the production of
82:21 insulin from your pancreas it's bad news
82:26 and for all the scientists that pride
82:29 themselves on being evolutionists okay
82:32 well I can use it against you man went
82:36 millions and millions of years is almost
82:38 a paean sapien without any of this
82:40 bombardment of home networks of wireless
82:44 transmissions of height our attention to
82:48 our lines toxic GMO foods microwaves
82:51 that pulverize
82:53 food compounds into food elements that
82:55 are toxic you know again draconian
82:59 chemotherapy
83:00 let's make chemotherapy completely
83:03 obsolete let's put oncologist completely
83:05 out of business can you imagine going to
83:07 some medical conference and you've got
83:10 the safe five thousand oncologists
83:12 coming in to get sort of an update and
83:15 you walk up to the podium and you say
83:16 we're going to cure cancer this is the
83:20 cure everyone's gonna take it it's not
83:22 gonna exist you're all out of business
83:24 what do you think what happened
83:26 instantaneously they're going to go back
83:28 to their little breakout points and
83:30 strategize how to stop the cure of
83:32 cancer they're gonna strategize on
83:34 creating new forms of cancer that can't
83:36 be cured by the cure of cancer because
83:38 that's their job
83:40 pharmaceutical companies that make tons
83:42 of treatments for cancer are going to
83:44 put their billions and billions of
83:46 dollars behind the conspiracy to keep
83:49 cancer alive that's what living in a
83:52 world of lies turns into which is why
83:54 personally me I want to live in a world
83:57 of truth there are still plenty of
84:00 infinite mysteries in life you know we
84:03 haven't cured the common cold we haven't
84:06 cured the anomalies of love you know we
84:08 there's plenty of things the the
84:10 everything is great but you don't know
84:12 who you are you don't know what you want
84:14 to do maybe you did everything you
84:15 fantasized about doing in your life and
84:17 now you've got time on your hands you're
84:20 trying to find out how to get through
84:21 your midlife crisis we have plenty of
84:23 mysteries in this world god forbid we
84:26 turn into a society where we live in
84:30 sort of the golden era of the Greek
84:32 theater where we enjoy creating
84:36 beautiful stories that help us educate
84:38 each other through parables hidden
84:40 inside of plays you know I'm gonna cite
84:44 something because it comes to mind right
84:45 now I told the story once a long long
84:49 time ago I had made a friend with the
84:51 girl who was my dental hygienist and her
84:55 and I just became friends hung out a
84:57 little bit afterwards with her friends
84:59 and I even hung out with her fiance at
85:01 the time they're now married with
85:02 children and I finally met her husband
85:05 at a restaurant
85:06 and I just shook hands talked to the guy
85:09 and then she told me later on that her
85:11 husband said man that guy is really a
85:13 nice guy I mean he really is genuine he
85:15 was amazed then he met someone who was
85:17 genuine and nice honest all right why it
85:22 let's just say that's true let's say I'm
85:23 a nice guy why is that the case well by
85:27 the time my mind started becoming
85:29 cognitive reality whereby I could
85:32 remember most of the years of my
85:34 existence I was about six or seven years
85:37 old well that's right when America went
85:40 into the late 70s the second half of the
85:43 70s I got my formative years in the in
85:46 the 80s and even though it wasn't a full
85:49 cakewalk whatever I can tell you right
85:51 now the things that I experienced living
85:54 in tough neighborhoods were you know it
85:55 was like you had to fight your way home
85:56 that kind of [ __ ] in the end it made me
85:59 a better person I got to see this and I
86:01 never adopted the lunacy that was around
86:05 me if I happen to get into it but when I
86:06 finally got back to my little hometown
86:08 in Kansas again tiny town with ten
86:11 thousand people you don't have the
86:13 ability to be a jerk unless you want to
86:15 be completely ostracized from that
86:17 society and I can't name more than a
86:20 handful of people that ever accomplished
86:22 that you got along you behaved because
86:26 your parents would be told what happened
86:27 your grandparents will be told and
86:28 because you want the love from them you
86:30 behave and again whatever you feed grows
86:33 so if you feed your devious side you
86:35 become a devious bastard was igner
86:38 presence key kind of guy so by the time
86:41 I moved to California I had had a
86:45 training wheel program and a methodology
86:48 from some Norman Rockwell town that I
86:51 grew up in that kept me straight then I
86:53 moved to Southern California right here
86:55 but I moved in the northern part in
86:57 Ventura County the company I work for
86:59 you know we did turbo tax back in 87 it
87:04 was called Mac and tax back in the day
87:07 the people that I worked for were
87:09 exactly like me Ventura County is almost
87:13 well I would say Ventura specifically
87:15 but I worked in Camarillo so between
87:17 camry on Ventura which is about three
87:18 towns with Oxnard in the middle
87:21 people were good to each other
87:23 Oxnard was a big Latin based town and I
87:28 would I would walk to lunch every once
87:30 in a while you know I had to drive to
87:32 the center of the town but I walk around
87:34 everyone small because they'd have these
87:35 Mexican festivals and you know the the
87:38 you could learn a million things from
87:41 just the Mexican culture and how they
87:42 had at least all those wild slammed cars
87:45 that do the three will and stuff that
87:47 you know Snoop Dogg drove around with a
87:48 Warren G and all those guys they're made
87:51 in Oxnard that's one of the biggest
87:52 places on earth they make those and
87:54 they're just the most beautiful people
87:56 on planet Earth and you get inside their
87:58 family circles and you're like wow this
88:00 is this is the same as my hometown it's
88:02 just they're all from Mexico but they've
88:04 been here for 100 plus years and so this
88:06 is their territory and they welcome you
88:08 in there and they'll check you out a
88:10 little bit but they there was no gang
88:11 violence and there ain't that [ __ ] it
88:14 was great and so I got this nice
88:15 incubation I got to continue for almost
88:19 four more years in Southern California
88:21 with this truth it was just a part of us
88:24 we helped each other out you needed
88:27 something someone took their shirt off
88:28 their back and said here you look cold
88:30 and you're like well you look cold tuna
88:32 so I got it's okay you look sick and
88:34 cold you know so they give it to and
88:35 you're good we want truth we want that
88:38 beautiful frequency because think about
88:40 how much the human mind gets constrained
88:43 by living in lies and once again you
88:45 feed the ability to lie to exist you you
88:48 lie all the time because it becomes a
88:50 technique that you know no better
88:52 technique to do it or you think that
88:56 truth is for suckers what a sad epitaph
89:01 if that's true the Great Awakening is
89:04 about trying to find as much truth as
89:06 possible this episode is about getting
89:08 one of the stains in American history
89:11 exposed cleaned up and then building
89:15 literally what you might call a human
89:17 platform for our country to operate on
89:20 and then it's infectious what if we came
89:23 clean about the NASA hoax would Russia
89:26 have the ability to do their thing I
89:27 mean Vladimir Putin is not remotely
89:31 responsible for any of the crap that
89:32 they did in the 60s and seven
89:34 all right that they at least had the
89:37 wherewithal in 73 to say we we have
89:39 boosters way more powerful than yours
89:41 and we can't escape Earth's orbit so
89:44 hats off to the Russians I have a lot of
89:46 respect for that but what are the things
89:49 what other wars were orchestrated you
89:51 know we now know that the opium wars of
89:54 China or completely forced on them
89:56 because of this profiteering by the UK
89:59 not the citizens of the UK today
90:01 everyone in the everyone in the UK today
90:04 - maybe a few politicians they don't
90:08 engage in opium trade now they're just
90:11 normal human beings that want a
90:12 beautiful world for themselves the
90:14 worshipping of the king and queen well
90:16 that is naive but that is not the intent
90:19 is genuine they want to believe that
90:21 there are these King Arthur descendants
90:23 out there and that there are special
90:24 human beings they set your etc so they
90:26 hang on to that fairytale you know maybe
90:29 at an extreme case organiz organized
90:33 religion gets Dee organized we no longer
90:36 have these pedophile agencies that get a
90:38 blank check constantly you're raping and
90:41 and destroying the minds of children
90:44 constantly well you just you're the
90:45 church so you're okay with that you know
90:47 we're okay with you being okay with that
90:49 you've got an excuse well then it's no
90:51 no big deal I think you feel me it's a
90:55 beautiful day it's amazing
90:57 hopefully this episode reflects the
91:00 warmth that I feel here it's pretty
91:02 great anyway if you have mid to deep
91:04 thoughts radio com please go that's
91:06 where we offer two different feeds video
91:09 and audio those of you want to get into
91:10 the discussion we have a locked Facebook
91:12 group for those of you like Twitter for
91:15 your notifications there's a Twitter
91:17 account actually I just remembered I
91:18 need to post a couple notifications
91:20 there I don't think a lot of people
91:22 really want to view it at a location
91:24 that doesn't actually have the medium
91:27 capable of being viewed within the
91:28 platform itself but those who want to
91:31 tip and donate you want to buy me a
91:33 cigar indirectly we have a patreon page
91:36 the channels doing well it's growing for
91:39 those of you have ideas for episodes you
91:41 can comment in the YouTube channel and
91:43 the Facebook page just understand that
91:46 if you really really
91:48 really want your episode to be covered
91:49 and you have like five hours worth of
91:53 video that you want me to watch you
91:55 probably should watch the five hours of
91:56 video paraphrase it to me so I can get
91:59 in quicker and get the information just
92:01 imagine you're my producer at a
92:04 television show or a radio show I'm
92:07 locking in every single day doing three
92:09 hours or whatever it is I don't have
92:11 time necessarily to watch everyone's
92:14 ideas but what a producer will do is do
92:17 the research find it out and say these
92:20 are the these are the points and you
92:23 need to put your own spin on this of
92:25 course because it's your show whatever
92:26 it's not my show that sort of thing
92:28 because you don't want to be liable for
92:29 my opinions that's what I'm really
92:30 trying to say here
92:32 but pre-produced it as best you can and
92:34 I will do my best to get to it they're
92:37 moving along I probably have about four
92:39 videos that haven't been released so
92:42 thank you for joining take care of
92:45 yourself on someone else and I'll see
92:46 you in the next summer day over and out
