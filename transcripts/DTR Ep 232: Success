00:35 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:39 deep thoughts today we're gonna cover
00:42 success so let's think about this first
00:46 one second success actually brings up so
00:50 many different subjects because you have
00:53 some folks that live their life for what
00:56 they perceive to be the goal of success
01:00 and some of people some people actually
01:04 just evade it because they feel like
01:06 it's too stressful to achieve something
01:09 not too many people but the interesting
01:15 thing is is the definition of success is
01:17 just like a snowflake for everybody
01:20 right
01:21 completely different notion of what
01:25 success is for every human being so this
01:29 episode is for those of you who feel
01:33 angst every single day whether it be all
01:37 day or just a couple times a day because
01:40 in your mind you have achieved success
01:45 we're gonna we're gonna work on the myth
01:49 of what that is success let's look at it
01:53 you know I mean there's a million ways
01:54 to look at a lot of the subjects covered
01:55 on this show I always try to pick a
01:58 couple big course views on something so
02:02 that we can kind of like it's it's just
02:04 you know the the tiny vignettes of what
02:09 it could be are obvious and something
02:12 you can go down with
02:13 on your personal time right in terms of
02:15 a rabbit hole right but why cover the
02:18 subject before we jump in the obvious
02:22 reason is I want you to have as much
02:23 success as you can possibly have in your
02:25 life so in my travels success has taken
02:31 on several different meanings there are
02:36 the the weird ones that I actually was
02:38 raised into that there were the weird
02:42 precepts I had as a kid you know I never
02:46 really had being famous as as an ocean I
02:51 did think about doing things that might
02:53 make me famous but never ever for the
02:55 fame itself but I know obviously plenty
02:58 of kids that that live for that today
03:01 and you know you could never ever get
03:04 famous just wanting to be famous you
03:05 have to have a skill set you have to
03:07 have something that is interesting I
03:09 mean I can't say never ever but it won't
03:12 last and it's really not real once you
03:15 come up with something real to offer
03:17 Society right the other one is to get
03:22 rich right and rich when you're young
03:27 and sort of ignorant to what that means
03:29 it's you know buying a fancy house
03:31 buying a fancy car fancy things but then
03:34 once you have all those things you soon
03:36 realized that that wasn't a really
03:39 intense goal that wasn't a goal it's
03:41 really gonna make you happy and then you
03:43 realize money if nothing else buys you
03:46 freedom in a way right depending on how
03:50 you can adjust how much money you can
03:51 make in the time you're going to make
03:55 that money because at some point you're
03:57 successful and either you sit on that
03:59 money and invest it or you have enough
04:05 and you simply live comfortably that
04:09 everyone's always investing their cash
04:10 right some folks can never get enough
04:15 they love the hunt of making money they
04:20 like the money as well but overall if
04:23 given the choice of having the money or
04:24 the hunt
04:26 I know some folks that would take the
04:28 hunt over the money and then I think
04:32 there's the sane individuals that have
04:34 the best definition for success because
04:36 those other two aren't so good and
04:39 that's someone who is looking to create
04:44 a family looking to create a life that
04:48 is just beneficial to mankind they're
04:52 good to themselves they're good to other
04:53 people and they just live in perpetual
04:56 balance with the resources that they
04:57 have available they might sit on a porch
05:02 and watch cars go by my twittle some
05:04 would they might go fish
05:06 they might sit and read a book they live
05:10 a very basic normal life and they are
05:15 able to keep themselves in an ecosystem
05:17 with other human beings and such that
05:19 they're always enriching someone helping
05:23 someone who's down that kind of stuff
05:25 right and that's the contrast I really
05:28 want to bring up in this episode which
05:30 is I want to get down to the very kernel
05:34 of that feeling that if you're
05:35 struggling with success with whatever
05:38 definition you may or may not have right
05:40 you may actually feel like you haven't
05:42 succeeded but when I ask you what what
05:44 would you need to do to feel like you're
05:46 a success you have no clue happens all
05:49 the time don't feel bad but we don't
05:53 want to get the angst out of you
05:55 completely you know I feel like just
05:58 thinking about people's angst
06:01 there's this weird thing that we do as
06:03 human beings and that is to lust for
06:07 something that is sort of an enigma you
06:11 just feel like there's something better
06:13 out there the chances are that if you
06:17 are brought up in an area of the world
06:19 which is nice it is balanced like I grew
06:21 up in a really nice balanced community I
06:24 mean amazing community all my relatives
06:27 were in one town at one point I was so
06:30 lucky and I didn't know that there were
06:32 int there was any other combination for
06:35 quite quite a few years I was the one
06:38 moving away no one else moved away
06:40 but if you come from a really tight
06:43 community there's usually this really
06:45 weird thing that occurs that is not
06:47 exactly directly so associated with
06:50 success but it becomes almost a
06:51 precursor to whatever you end up doing
06:54 I'll give you an example I moved from
06:56 the Midwest to California I come to I
06:59 bounced around a little bit but I end up
07:00 in this little town called Camarillo
07:03 which is in the northern tip of Southern
07:06 California just before you head up to
07:08 Santa Barbara beautiful town
07:11 and I got into the old kind of 70s 80s
07:15 version of Camarillo and I say old
07:19 because now it's 2017 but it was just
07:22 bustling a lot of construction a lot of
07:24 great restaurants going in great but the
07:26 lot places were already there it was
07:27 really cool and I meet a bunch of great
07:31 kids who grew up on the same block
07:32 together and if they didn't grow up on
07:34 the same block together they grew up
07:35 within six miles of each other it's like
07:37 a Township right and what really blows
07:41 my mind all right is that you know I
07:46 live with a family try the guy that a
07:49 guy was kind of my age you I was in a
07:51 church community at the time he was in
07:53 love with the girl I had two brothers
07:56 down the street there was another girl
07:58 down the street who was part of the
08:00 group that we're in and now I think
08:03 every single one of them lives in Texas
08:05 because they went to Abilene Texas like
08:08 this Christian college there and they
08:10 all picked up their stuff from sunny
08:12 beautiful California with every amenity
08:15 you could possibly imagine from beaches
08:17 to amusement parks to art to music -
08:19 everything design and they all packed up
08:22 and they went to Texas and they stayed
08:25 and as a person from Kansas I thought
08:29 why the hell would you want to go to the
08:31 Midwest when you live in literally one
08:33 of the most gorgeous areas and Camarillo
08:35 just is at the tip of Malibu so when you
08:39 hit the coast and you start going south
08:41 I mean it's just a few miles and you're
08:43 Zuma Beach and that's where they filmed
08:45 plenty of the Apes finale right it's all
08:47 the most beautiful beaches on planet
08:49 earth the whole coast is amazing
08:52 and it's because their minds had a
08:55 pattern that they were bored with and so
08:58 they moved to a place that was
09:00 completely different and I did exactly
09:01 the same thing I love where I'm from but
09:05 California had you know palm trees and
09:07 great great weather I didn't have any I
09:10 don't have any allergies here I mean
09:12 it's just a it's a fabulous place plus
09:14 work-wise there's just infinite jobs if
09:17 you're willing to apply yourself so I
09:19 think that's cool and the people are
09:21 awesome of course all right why go down
09:27 that that little digression I bring that
09:31 to your attention because there's a
09:32 little seed in you depending on where
09:34 your angst is sort of vectored where
09:37 it's pointed right if you are sort of in
09:42 an unknown feeling where you're like
09:43 geez I don't like where I live I don't
09:45 know I feel like I need some rural town
09:47 somewhere doesn't matter if you're in
09:49 Europe or America or whatever and you
09:51 know there's a big city out there let me
09:54 throw you some words of caution about
09:56 that and give you some encouragement at
09:59 the same time this grass is greener
10:04 thing is always tempered by reality
10:07 right sometimes it is I you know it's
10:10 greener where you where you want to go
10:12 but I guarantee you're gonna be leaving
10:13 behind some green that you can't take
10:16 with you some things that you hold
10:18 cultural things you can't take with you
10:20 food you can't take your relatives with
10:22 you most of the time so let they're left
10:25 behind and you go to this new land and
10:29 it's plentiful this is exactly my life
10:31 right I came to California and and I
10:34 just really lucked out on a level that
10:37 was crazy I didn't have I just picked up
10:40 the right newspaper applied for the
10:42 right jobs and magic happen right but
10:46 now what I left behind was tough I left
10:50 behind all my family and the elderly
10:53 grandparents that I had you know which
10:55 weren't that elderly when I left but you
10:57 know there they were just approaching
10:59 entering their seventies about the time
11:01 I left no go back to see him a couple
11:04 times a year if I could
11:06 but they passed away they got sick and
11:08 they passed away and I wasn't there I
11:10 went to their funerals but no matter how
11:14 I sliced it I couldn't just be hanging
11:16 out I couldn't support them I couldn't
11:18 keep them entertained and so one by one
11:21 they expired and one by one I went to
11:24 their funerals except for one and that's
11:28 a huge price to pay depending on how
11:29 close you are to your families but
11:32 sometimes where you live just doesn't
11:34 have the jobs at least the ones that
11:37 you're interested in so you have to pick
11:39 up and move the one thing I want to get
11:42 into your brain before we really start
11:44 some more fundamental thoughts here is
11:46 that you know there's a reason why money
11:49 is called currency there's a reason why
11:52 currents wash up against banks right
11:56 banks are the moment when a current
11:58 stops for a split second they've picked
12:02 these terms for very specific reasons in
12:04 English language at least because money
12:08 has to continue flowing otherwise it has
12:10 no value to those who accumulated you
12:15 can't collect interest without moving
12:17 your money around you can you may think
12:19 in your brain it's in a bank but they've
12:22 taken your money and they've moved it
12:23 and did all kinds of different things
12:25 right sometimes some pretty crappy
12:27 mechanisms well you are a piece in
12:34 society that needs to move around if you
12:39 need change you could move around inside
12:42 your tiny community you could move a
12:44 little bar rule to your community go to
12:46 the big city or once in a while or maybe
12:49 if you do your math and if you look at
12:52 where you think you want to go or if
12:54 you're completely lost and simply
12:55 unhappy we're gonna get to that too
12:58 because I don't want you have any false
12:59 definitions of being unhappy and then
13:01 you run off and destroy your life but
13:04 you may need to pick up from where you
13:06 are and go to a more populated area with
13:08 better job prospects but let me just
13:11 throw this at you the amount of people
13:15 I've helped get jobs and re-engineer
13:17 their lives is in the dozens
13:20 what's fascinating about my
13:22 participation in their life is that when
13:27 I sit down with them like they're asking
13:29 for help and this is none of you guys
13:30 these are my close friends they have no
13:35 clue what they want to do now some folks
13:38 are smart they have no clue and so they
13:40 sit and they think about it and they
13:42 figure out where they need to be might
13:45 take weeks to figure out might take
13:46 months might take a couple years but in
13:48 the end they don't make any moves until
13:49 they know what they want to do but in
13:51 the meantime they are personally trying
13:53 everything they possibly can within
13:55 their area they're reading books they're
13:57 doing trade skills trying to program
13:59 trying to draw whatever whatever the
14:02 hell that might be but even after they
14:05 find it what's interesting is it's very
14:07 few folks believe that you need to plan
14:09 your life or that after you've had your
14:14 first plan at eighteen or right after
14:17 you graduate from college at 22 that
14:19 they don't feel like they need to plan
14:21 again it's just gonna work out and yet
14:25 sometimes it works out you know my big
14:27 epiphany when I came to California and
14:30 found work very easily and very quickly
14:33 was that I had this saying by the age of
14:36 19 I was saying this saying I said look
14:38 I think the motto of my life is survival
14:43 is easy success is a drag and what I
14:46 meant by that was when I came from the
14:49 Midwest they said if you didn't have a
14:51 college education
14:52 you simply were not going to be
14:54 employable at all ever in your life
14:57 you're gonna dig ditches or whatever
14:59 you're gonna die in a ditch well the
15:03 reality was that if you apply yourself
15:06 and well hell if you just go back a
15:09 hundred years in history nobody had
15:10 these degrees you know but that you know
15:13 you might think in your mind well the
15:15 skillsets and the jobs weren't as
15:17 complex as they are today yes you're
15:20 correct
15:21 Touche however do not forget the the
15:26 ability for a human being to teach
15:27 themselves without a college to get
15:31 books to get resources and learn
15:33 without walking into an institution and
15:36 you know creating accreting incredible
15:38 debt right so even though the jobs were
15:42 simpler doesn't matter men were simpler
15:45 the jobs are simpler and so they're able
15:48 to teach themselves that job now the
15:50 average IQ is a lot higher than well in
15:53 some respects and so they're able to
15:55 ingest much more complicated information
15:58 and get up to snuff right let me think
16:01 about it a cellphone is complicated to
16:04 configure for your average baby boomer
16:06 right so as a computer so when you think
16:10 about the kids that are helping their
16:12 parents they're doing all kinds of
16:16 complicated stuff on a daily basis and
16:18 so them jumping off into an employable
16:20 career is not that hard to believe right
16:24 but the point of what I'm trying to say
16:26 here at this particular level is that
16:27 you need to plan your life and I can
16:30 tell you right now it can be the most
16:33 fun thing you've ever done especially if
16:37 you've been again I'm going to beat up
16:38 this metaphor the pinball in the pinball
16:40 machine getting kicked around and bumped
16:42 around and flipped around the circuit
16:46 that you sit down and plan your life
16:50 you're suddenly taking back the reins
16:53 you're suddenly saying you know what I'm
16:55 not taking this anymore I mean you might
16:57 have to take it a couple more weeks or
16:59 months or whatever to you get your point
17:00 executed but in the end you see the
17:02 light at the end of the tunnel and you
17:06 have a goal that's what we need to get
17:09 you depending on where you are and again
17:12 if you're fine you just need a little
17:13 fine-tuning adjustments well you can
17:15 forget this state these areas their
17:18 course adjustments but maybe tuck it in
17:20 the back of your brain just in case you
17:22 find yourself in that situation or you
17:24 get the freedom to redesign your life
17:26 you're completely happy and you just
17:28 want to maybe start from scratch or can
17:32 you know start from scratch and
17:33 reorganize what you're already doing you
17:35 say look I'm in this business already
17:37 but I feel like it's kind of chaotic I
17:39 want to have it cleaned up from it's
17:42 like when you clean up your house right
17:43 you're not moving to a different house
17:45 you're simply just going
17:47 maybe rearranging the furniture hidden
17:49 glare off the TV from the front door
17:51 that's opening up letting the Sun and at
17:52 five o'clock you know you're just making
17:55 things better
17:56 refining things right but let's look at
17:59 what success is because as I mentioned
18:01 on several episodes you know I've lived
18:04 a very bizarre life and I still do I
18:07 don't have things that the guy across
18:09 the street has he might be looking to me
18:12 saying god I wish I was in that guy's
18:14 life we're looking at each other and I
18:19 think that what would happen is both of
18:22 us might try try out each other's lives
18:24 we'd want to keep certain aspects of
18:26 what we got from each other's lives but
18:28 in the end we might want our own life's
18:30 back I don't know what's important to me
18:34 is that people understand that the
18:36 simplest things of life can be the most
18:38 successful things in life but
18:40 unfortunately if you watch television
18:43 which is now Hollywood and television
18:46 together I hate to even say go to movies
18:48 I don't know that many people that go to
18:49 movies anymore but you're conditioned
18:52 away from thinking that that some of the
18:55 most amazing what might be referred to
18:58 as mundane things can be actually
19:00 incredibly rewarding now the other part
19:03 is is that you can work really hard
19:06 slave on something and succeed and you
19:11 love it you have this euphoric feeling
19:13 and you look around the rest of the
19:16 world who comes to see it or whatever
19:18 and and you think wow they can't even
19:20 they probably don't understand what I
19:22 just did I wish they did but it's just
19:25 too much it's too much to explain things
19:27 right you know every time I write a
19:30 script and people read it and they love
19:33 it they look at it and they go wow this
19:36 was 2 hours worth of reading at the
19:39 quickest and even though I enjoyed it
19:44 it's there must have been a tremendous
19:45 effort to get all this organized and get
19:48 it all to work perfectly inside the
19:50 script right and so they enjoy the labor
19:53 that I put into it but let me kind of I
19:57 want to pull back here for one second
20:00 and
20:01 suggest something that you guys have
20:03 probably already felt but let's say that
20:06 we have person a and person B and person
20:08 a works on projects they're very intense
20:13 projects that take a lot of time away
20:14 from family if there is one and then
20:20 person B just raises a family goes to
20:23 work has some great kids as a husband or
20:25 wife or what have you and they are more
20:29 of the spectator there down inside the
20:32 crowd that person a is up on the stage
20:34 and most the time now what's interesting
20:36 is they both if they both are successful
20:41 with what they're doing there's a
20:43 successful arc and crescendo to their
20:45 life sort of the first person gets
20:51 everything in a big boom right work
20:54 really really hard you're totally
20:55 isolated most the time you got your
20:57 business partners or what have you your
20:59 muse that that inspires you or what have
21:03 you your small feedback team and if it
21:06 if it succeeds all right there's a big
21:08 odd that it won't succeed so it was a
21:10 gamble if it succeeds you get this
21:13 horrendous rush of success and alkaloids
21:18 and maybe fame maybe money right you
21:23 work on an album or something
21:24 you know for a really long time
21:26 what-have-you person B is living a solid
21:31 life right they get up in the morning
21:35 they get the kids up they fight him to
21:37 get them dressed and fed and off to
21:39 school they go off to work they come on
21:41 they're pooped we got the kids they run
21:43 the whole ritual of food bathing
21:47 homework bed and then you get a little
21:50 bit of time to yourself and you go to
21:51 bed maybe got a spouse to share your
21:53 time with and to you it's this crazy
21:57 grind right you're investing in the long
22:00 haul of the entire algorithm of family
22:04 now deep down inside you know you're
22:09 building a family
22:12 you are building a family that will give
22:15 you incredibly almost I mean it may
22:19 always comes with trials and
22:20 tribulations but overall you're creating
22:22 a more guaranteed algorithm of success
22:24 as long as you enjoy your family the big
22:28 explosion of happiness that comes from
22:31 these type a people that are going off I
22:33 don't know mean type a is an anal but
22:36 just this first group of folks they get
22:39 it all in one giant Rush and they don't
22:41 get it every single time
22:42 the second group gets similar things
22:46 where some days are tougher than other
22:47 days if does you don't agree with your
22:49 spouse sometimes your kids going through
22:50 a bad stage or whatever but overall you
22:53 kind of get this average mean of
22:54 positivity so imagine it's the same
22:58 amount of energy
22:59 it's just stretched over time but in the
23:02 end the second group actually again if
23:07 there's longer kids stay alive right
23:09 they're able to have this family and
23:12 their grandkids and all these crazy wild
23:15 experiences were then they're not on the
23:16 hook anymore because as soon as the kid
23:18 gets out of college they should be
23:20 supporting themselves best they can and
23:23 then you kind of get to coast and
23:26 hopefully you got a decent enough job
23:27 that you don't run out of money or
23:29 something like that which unfortunately
23:32 happens more often than it should these
23:33 days so there are these two different
23:37 lifestyles and I really think that you
23:40 know there's a few hybrids in between
23:41 probably right but you have to make a
23:44 choice as to what life you want to live
23:46 and I think that you have to look at
23:50 your level of codependency for other
23:52 human beings before you make that choice
23:55 if you're fairly codependent and I don't
23:58 mean you know that is a derogatory thing
24:01 I just mean you understand you love
24:03 companionship you need to be socially
24:06 engaged you need a hug every day you
24:09 know you don't like sleeping alone
24:12 you feel like you have something to
24:14 share and if no one's around then you're
24:16 sort of just sitting there wasting away
24:18 doesn't mean you have to have a family
24:20 of 10 doesn't it doesn't mean you have
24:22 to have any kids
24:23 it just means you with
24:26 a companion well then you have to be
24:28 very careful about which life you pick
24:30 and if you want part if you want the
24:33 first category of really you know maybe
24:36 you're a writer maybe you're an inventor
24:37 or whatever the case might be but
24:39 whatever you do requires a lot of a long
24:41 time you're going to have to be very
24:44 strategic about your partner that you
24:46 pick and you're gonna have to
24:48 communicate with that partner and let me
24:50 give you some advice don't do not pick a
24:53 partner exactly like you without being
24:56 very careful the best partnerships I've
25:00 ever seen in my life are partners where
25:05 you have an individual who's just a
25:07 monster entrepreneurial person they make
25:11 pretty much most the money in the family
25:12 in the partnership and the other person
25:15 is perhaps an accountant a money person
25:18 someone who can help facilitate the
25:23 business or at least get out of the way
25:25 or provide the relief the mental relief
25:29 that this other person needs as a result
25:32 of working really hard one of the
25:35 toughest things you could ever do I'll
25:38 just put this little caution out and for
25:39 those of you are younger I wish I had
25:42 heard this information a long time ago
25:44 let me tell you if you want to be an
25:48 entrepreneur you have to be careful to
25:51 engage another entrepreneur as a partner
25:54 in your life meaning you know a partner
25:58 that you are in a relationship with that
26:01 you live with what have you because if
26:03 you bring two entrepreneurs together and
26:05 there's a definition of an entrepreneur
26:07 right you have your fully established
26:11 business person which is really a person
26:14 who's graduated out of being an
26:16 entrepreneur an entrepreneur is usually
26:18 I mean there's all kinds of definitions
26:19 for this for the sake of this particular
26:22 episode think of an entrepreneur and
26:24 this designation as someone who's
26:25 attempting to be successful in what
26:27 they're doing
26:28 once they're successful they only take
26:32 back the entrepreneurial designation if
26:36 they sell that business or they've got
26:39 it off to the side
26:40 they're diving into a brand new venture
26:42 but because every venture can suck you
26:44 dry all your money all your time you
26:47 could lose everything to lose your mind
26:49 or whatever you have to be careful
26:53 blending your life with another person
26:55 it's in this mode if you're both in that
26:59 mode the problem is is that you're both
27:00 having your patients pool ground down
27:02 you're both suffering off and on again
27:05 you could be really lucky that you're
27:06 really taking on a existing business you
27:10 really lucked out maybe your family
27:13 sells real estate you never got into it
27:15 then you become an entrepreneur you take
27:17 over the business and it's really all
27:18 it's all established you got a name
27:20 already established the paperwork
27:22 pipelines established whatever so that's
27:25 sort of just like taking over someone
27:28 else's business and not really being an
27:30 entrepreneur so that's why I can tell
27:32 you that the couples that I've seen
27:34 they're complementary to each other one
27:36 is an entrepreneur one works a
27:38 nine-to-five job that works a hell of a
27:41 lot better so you want to set your
27:43 foundation up properly before you try to
27:47 move too deep into something that's very
27:49 difficult now a lot of you were young
27:50 enough you haven't found your partner
27:52 yet and you're just hunkering down for
27:54 your own business that's a great place
27:56 to be trust me what I always tell folks
27:59 is today they tell you to be a child
28:02 forever you know you're not to really
28:07 engage your life until you're in your
28:09 30s and that's really kind of an
28:11 unofficial generalization but we have
28:14 manchild children now right I'm gonna
28:17 get pretty serious pretty quickly but
28:19 the but the guys really screw it up by
28:21 waiting too damn long to get their [ __ ]
28:23 together
28:24 so again just in setting up the
28:27 foundation for the success algorithm
28:29 here you know you can take risks if
28:33 you're really gonna go balls to the wall
28:34 in this first version here where you're
28:36 gonna be more isolated take more risks
28:38 you want to do that stuff in your 20s
28:41 for a couple reasons one you're young
28:44 and your energy levels are extremely
28:46 high when you eat food you don't get a
28:50 lot of you don't gain weight you can
28:52 just run it out your
28:53 calorie conversion of sugars in your
28:56 body or just at an all-time mine to
29:00 usually life cost a lot less when you're
29:02 younger you're willing to drive a shitty
29:05 car you're willing to live in a
29:06 one-bedroom apartment or a one-bedroom
29:10 studio or rent a room from someone's
29:12 house or staying in garage hell I rented
29:13 a garage for two and a half years when I
29:15 first came out wasn't my first thing I
29:17 did but when I got to Camarillo it was
29:20 it was converted into a home inside the
29:23 garage but you know not a garage door by
29:26 my bed my bed was a fold-out sofa you
29:29 know his family was gracious enough to
29:31 to refund my rent
29:33 when I was done I guess I'm gonna I'm
29:36 gonna give a prop out I said to do this
29:38 they'll have no idea I did it unless
29:41 somebody tells them but there's a
29:43 company in Oxnard California called the
29:47 wiggins forklift company and I I don't
29:50 know if they still own the place or not
29:51 but it's named after their surname but I
29:54 had a chance to live with the wiggins
29:56 for two and a half years in Camarillo
29:59 and they were some of the sweetest
30:02 people on planet Earth
30:03 and so you know and I say I got
30:06 fortunate I was fortunate and it was
30:08 interesting because it was right around
30:09 the time that I had been laid off from
30:13 work because the Texas company that
30:15 makes you know turbo tax had lost a
30:17 bunch of cash and had to lay us off the
30:20 day after tax day it was like April 16th
30:22 1989 two days later I got the my first
30:26 job drawing video games and so I lived
30:29 with the Wiggins for a couple years did
30:33 my video games then actually left that
30:36 industry for a really short bit went
30:37 back to the tax people for I don't know
30:40 how many months probably eight months
30:41 and then I moved to the Bay Area after
30:43 the the first recession of George Bush
30:46 Senior completely destroyed
30:48 California's sort of mini little silicon
30:53 beach down here in the Ventura County
30:56 area Simi Valley area but let's get into
30:59 it
31:00 let's get into the beacon that draws you
31:02 towards either a success that you think
31:05 you completely understand
31:07 which is great but we need to check it
31:10 you know is that ice ice cube said you
31:15 know check yourself before you wreck
31:16 yourself right he's absolutely right he
31:19 checked his life and he made it he's
31:21 falling up hills whole life really
31:24 talented guy because he planned his life
31:28 you know and I just talked about this in
31:31 the last episode this whole idea of you
31:35 know taking inventory of your mind and
31:37 making sure that what you have in your
31:38 mind is what you think you want is what
31:40 you put in there not someone else now
31:43 will tell you you can actually have some
31:45 wonderful moments by riding on a wave of
31:47 absolute [ __ ] you know someone you
31:51 know when I first moved to California
31:51 they said why did you move here
31:55 and I thought back and I thought well
31:57 you know my whole life every great movie
31:59 was paying homage to California it looks
32:03 amazing on paper when I looked through
32:05 the television set I said I saw the
32:07 video for the music the song I love LA
32:11 Jordan by the very famous writer your
32:13 name escapes me at the moment and you
32:16 know I saw commercials just one awesome
32:18 world after another in fictitious
32:20 settings and I guess that's why I'm here
32:23 and everything that I do is here it's
32:26 not where I live because I'm Way out of
32:28 the game from where I live right so
32:31 yours truly has been guilty of sort of
32:33 following these fictitious storylines
32:37 and promises of you know Los Angeles so
32:42 it can be beneficial but my big thing
32:45 was to create things you know people ask
32:48 me what what turns me on in the world
32:50 the most what motivates me the most
32:52 because I'm always talking about what
32:54 motivates other people and I just look
32:55 at them and I go I blow minds
32:58 that's what I want to do with my life
33:00 everything I do has got to have that
33:03 emotion of oh my god I didn't see this
33:06 coming and now it's here this is awesome
33:08 and you know I can tell you I'll make
33:13 things that millions of people's
33:15 millions of people have interacted with
33:18 a video game that goes up on yahoo game
33:20 that literally 60 million people play a
33:23 month down to I made a piece of software
33:28 for the local college near me for a
33:31 friend of mine and this this woman that
33:35 I was helping this poor woman had had
33:36 this job for 15 years she's 63 years old
33:39 and she's amazing
33:41 a woman who who was mastering a lot of
33:44 technology to do her job is really
33:46 interesting but when I got done
33:48 replacing that system she was using five
33:51 applications and a giant pipeline in a
33:53 circle this horribly manual error prone
33:56 to death and when I handed her the
34:00 solution she the first day she got
34:03 frustrated she thought she was kind of
34:05 confused because it was so simple she
34:07 thought for sure I hadn't forgotten a
34:09 something massive about what she needed
34:11 to do it took her a couple days to
34:13 figure it out after sitting down you
34:15 know and teaching her everything but
34:17 even though I showed her the paradigm of
34:18 it going from five pieces to one piece
34:20 from a hundred clicks to one click you
34:24 know you know a big facetious a little
34:26 bit there but dozens of clicks did one
34:28 click her having to think about things
34:31 and keep herself from making mistakes so
34:33 that she wouldn't lose her job was now
34:34 an automated process she still needed to
34:37 participate in the process of course I
34:39 didn't replace there anything but two
34:42 days later I came back to the office and
34:45 she was quiet she was looking right at
34:48 me and she said you know she's 63 she's
34:51 no dummy
34:52 right and she said you know I couldn't
34:57 conceive of how easy you made this and
35:00 I'm sorry I got a little testy there but
35:04 she goes this is amazing you know this I
35:06 didn't think this could be so easy she
35:08 kind of got choked up you know she got
35:11 really close to that kind of almost
35:12 crying in her mouth and her throat you
35:14 know and that's that's the other form of
35:18 blowing people away that's wonderful you
35:20 just blew away one person you did a I
35:23 did eight months of work to simplify
35:26 this woman's life for the rest of her
35:28 career she can now retire with this tool
35:30 it's a wonderful thing so thus that's
35:33 why I always say to you
35:34 you need to know the theme of why you
35:36 exist more than you need to know some
35:38 reward at the end of the tunnel the
35:40 rewards will come as long as you focus
35:42 on what it is you love to do right you
35:46 know I don't think anyone can like a
35:48 musician can't sit down and say boy I
35:50 want to be famous boy I want to have a
35:54 bunch of people worship me on stage I
35:57 want a lot of money you can't really and
36:01 then you all of a sudden sit down with
36:02 your instruments and write the best song
36:04 in the world then achieves all those
36:05 goals of the humble humble folks I have
36:09 met out of the rock and roll industry of
36:12 the mid-80s or the whole decade of the
36:15 80s who are unbelievably successful I
36:17 met a couple in the 90s they are humble
36:20 and they are super talented and it just
36:22 was a byproduct Fame and money was a
36:24 byproduct of their skill set now very
36:28 few folks let it get to their head and
36:30 very few folks can survive after they
36:33 let it get to their head because they
36:34 become obnoxious human beings we all
36:37 know the legacy handful of dubt you know
36:40 actors that do this the handful of
36:43 musicians that do this but they're known
36:44 for that because it's weird that they
36:47 ever got there that they couldn't
36:48 appreciate what they were what they were
36:50 given right the other thing I find is
36:54 that people who are worried about
36:55 success and who used that word to
36:57 describe their life and they try to take
36:59 action right they're trying to plan that
37:02 sort of thing sometimes you move a
37:04 little too quickly I am definitely a
37:08 person that for the first probably
37:10 thirty five years of my life I would
37:12 rush in pretty damn fast to something
37:14 I'd have an idea
37:15 and I wake up in the morning with having
37:18 never thought of this concept by
37:20 whatever to is three o'clock to 3:00 in
37:22 the afternoon or my evening I will have
37:25 this epiphany and I'll just jump in I'll
37:29 write the code I'll draw the artwork
37:31 whatever all the above and the problem
37:35 is is that probably 50% of time that
37:38 would work beautifully the other 50% of
37:41 the time I didn't plan enough and I
37:43 immediately ran into some fundamental
37:44 problem
37:46 that I didn't design around and so I
37:49 have to throw away almost everything I
37:51 did up until the point I found the
37:53 problem an important digression might be
37:57 so you could understand this process
37:59 just a little bit further when I teach
38:03 kids how to draw
38:06 you'll get usually most kids want to be
38:10 done as quick as possible to get the
38:12 alkylate and the dopamine rush of
38:18 approval from me the rush up I've done
38:21 I'm done and they literally have gone as
38:23 fast as they possibly can because they
38:25 want that little juice and you know at
38:31 first you might be encouraged to give
38:33 them a big thumbs up especially if
38:35 they've never drawn anything before and
38:36 their parents kind of concerned they
38:38 don't have an artistic bone in them
38:40 you're like oh my god that's amazing and
38:42 you might reinforce like that a few
38:44 times but very quickly after a few
38:47 reinforcements you need to start laying
38:49 down this notion that drawings take a
38:52 lot longer than a few seconds trying to
38:56 get it depends on what age the child is
38:57 but trying to get a nine-year-old to
38:58 draw one picture for one hour that's
39:02 tough right you have to do it next to
39:05 them
39:05 so they understand and you might end up
39:07 drawing next to them and taking a really
39:09 long time on one picture while they're
39:11 just sawing through paper we are the
39:15 same way as adults but just in a
39:17 different capacity especially when we're
39:20 talking about success we want to be
39:22 there already don't we I mean especially
39:24 if you start reengineering your life and
39:27 say you're mid-30s or above oh my god
39:30 you know I've been doing this forever
39:31 well in the end the truth of the matter
39:34 is is that you actually have more
39:36 patience than you did you do
39:38 we're number guards if you acknowledge
39:39 it or not you've got more patience to
39:42 plan better what I like to do with my
39:45 life at times is to take all the moving
39:48 parts and pieces and even you know just
39:50 the static pieces and parts that I have
39:53 access to maybe I make skill sets on the
39:55 left and you know people that I know
39:58 industries
39:59 I'm connected to and technology that I
40:02 understand on the right side and then I
40:04 start trying to bring them together do
40:06 the old Xanadu rock and roll in country
40:09 you know Osmond family thing right you
40:12 have to be over 40 get all that but I
40:17 bring it together and I find if there's
40:19 any commonalities and then what you're
40:22 doing is you're sort of doing alchemy
40:24 with what you're capable of engaging
40:26 with this life at this point in time and
40:30 you can whip up a whole formula to make
40:35 yourself happy and the chances are if
40:38 you really get your your pieces and
40:40 parts down you know it's like let me
40:42 give you more of an example so that you
40:44 you don't get lost in the metaphor let's
40:47 say you have the ability to craft things
40:51 and your craft with wood and you're a
40:55 painter maybe you're not a fine art
40:58 painter but you can do some nice things
41:00 with paint and over here you have a
41:05 bunch of stores downtown that sell those
41:07 kind of items but if your work wood and
41:10 paint them to look cool
41:11 or have some sort of functionality this
41:14 shop that's downtown can sell them so
41:19 the rookie would go and make a bunch of
41:21 these things and take it down to the
41:22 store and beg them to carry them but the
41:27 next step up from rookie a person who's
41:29 made the mistake before will go actually
41:30 down to the shop and say you know what
41:33 kind of stuff do you sell where do you
41:36 get your stuff from how much do you pay
41:39 would you be interested if I could make
41:41 this and you show them a drawing and
41:43 maybe it's ten different things you can
41:45 make I can really make anything that you
41:47 need but if you're but if you're paying
41:48 too much for that item or you think
41:50 there might be some sort of made in
41:52 America or mean whatever country you're
41:53 from bump to your sales if that's what
41:57 you could claim about it and you can say
41:59 yeah guy right down the street makes
42:00 them I can be that guy or I could be
42:03 that girl and they give you the thumbs
42:07 up and then you go buy your supplies
42:09 maybe you can you can sign some contract
42:12 or paperwork that'd be great
42:13 times when you're beginning you have to
42:14 take the risk without a lot of paperwork
42:16 and then you hone it out with those
42:19 folks you find out what works and what
42:21 doesn't work you shouldn't make a bunch
42:24 of these things you should make a couple
42:25 of these things take it down there and
42:27 see how they pan out create a demand
42:30 without losing a bunch of money in how
42:33 you're doing it today because what if
42:35 you made 20 and someone comes down there
42:38 and look setting goes oh my god you know
42:39 this is pretty cool but it's missing the
42:41 thing that I like that the other brand
42:42 has that you forgot the other thing and
42:45 it's something you can't add to it after
42:46 you make it and you go back down there
42:49 none of your stuff sold and the vendor
42:50 says you know well if you are the
42:52 retailer says you know if you had this
42:54 thing on there I didn't realize it was
42:55 on there when you brought yours in
42:57 didn't realize it was missing I could
42:59 have sold every single one of these and
43:01 you're like well I'm out of money and I
43:04 made all these wrong is that your saying
43:06 yeah I get angry you might blow up it's
43:09 not their fault
43:10 so again just start carefully but I
43:13 imagine this you start that relationship
43:16 and you make the right product and it
43:18 sells and doesn't sell like gangbusters
43:19 or anything but it sells pretty good
43:22 well obviously we've got the internet
43:25 out there now you can start perhaps
43:27 selling it also online probably not to
43:31 the market where the retailer is you
43:32 don't want to blow out their sales but
43:34 you get just sell direct if you can
43:37 master the retail and master the online
43:39 and really refine your product don't
43:43 leave it the same unless it's blowing up
43:45 on you like a pet rock or something but
43:48 if there's just more refinements you
43:49 making them better you make them out of
43:50 better material you reduce your cost you
43:52 find better places to buy your supplies
43:54 your paint your wood whatever then you
43:57 could go outside of the region where
43:58 that retailer has scope go to the next
44:01 city over next town over and you just
44:04 keep engaging retailers that sell this
44:07 thing that you make but you've already
44:10 developed it and honed it locally you've
44:13 kept your risk down you've excited
44:16 yourself maybe you took the product way
44:18 beyond what the competition does so now
44:20 you walk in the door and you've redefine
44:22 what success is to the retailer well I
44:25 make this thing already so
44:27 things okay wait check the size does
44:29 yours have this little widget on here
44:31 hmm what does that do well well you know
44:34 when you're doing this and that this
44:35 little thing handles this little
44:36 contingency it's a pain in the ass huh
44:39 no I don't I don't mind don't do that
44:42 well now they do all right well I'll
44:45 just leave like you know six of them
44:47 here you just sell them on consignment
44:49 I'll come back in a week we'll see how
44:51 you're doing come back in a week
44:53 hell four days goes by they've already
44:54 sold them they're calling you up because
44:56 you let the business card inside one of
44:57 them all right you see how it works
45:00 right but I'm not trying to make an
45:03 episode that's trying to tell you
45:04 exactly how to start a business what I
45:07 want to do is make sure that you
45:08 understand that the simplest things
45:10 could be the most wonderful things
45:12 because there's a bunch of people
45:14 telling you that you're not successful
45:18 and you know it's sort of frustrating
45:22 because they don't know you it's like me
45:26 telling you how to believe in God I'm
45:28 telling you what I believe in why I
45:29 believe it I might use an f-bomb here
45:31 and they get all passionate about it but
45:32 in the end I'm really not telling you
45:34 how to change your beliefs or form your
45:36 beliefs about God I'm just telling you
45:38 my own argument about it so someone
45:40 trying to tell you how to specifically
45:42 succeed yes an imperative you've got to
45:45 follow what I'm saying otherwise you're
45:46 gonna fail and that's that's being very
45:50 presumptuous about who you are as a
45:52 person I had an interesting experience
45:56 I'll say this without mentioning too
45:59 many proper nouns and names but there
46:02 are a bunch of groups in Los Angeles
46:03 that attempt to make your life better
46:06 and you join up to their groups and you
46:09 go to their classes and all this other
46:10 stuff and some of them help some people
46:13 and the same group doesn't help others
46:15 right but I went down for a friend of
46:19 mine and had a conversation you know I'm
46:20 just kind of as a guest of course they
46:22 always think you're gonna sign up
46:24 immediately and what's interesting about
46:27 it is that some people are missing
46:29 things in their lives that you're not
46:30 missing and so they don't understand how
46:33 you could possibly have this thing
46:34 already but they think that they're
46:37 broken and they're going to get it from
46:38 these classes and most the time it's
46:41 so rude rudimentary to their personality
46:43 that a class doesn't really help it's
46:45 just it's just a reality right but I sat
46:47 in this chair looks like conference room
46:50 chair and this dude starts talking to me
46:55 and he's one of the big kind of head
46:57 evangelists of this particular course
47:00 and he has no idea I do this show and
47:02 then I get really deep and cerebral and
47:05 then I don't have this average life
47:06 because he used to kind of talking to
47:08 people that are sort of lost in life I
47:10 guess I don't mean that in a bad way I
47:13 just mean they haven't found what they
47:14 want to do with their life he was one of
47:16 them and he found a lot of benefit from
47:18 this course so that's cool for him but
47:21 he kept talking to me and he was digging
47:24 and digging and digging and trying to
47:26 like surprise me with epiphanies you
47:28 know and I'm like I'm like well I have a
47:30 youtube shot at one point I was like I
47:31 got a youtube show and I got a episode
47:33 about that and I got episode about that
47:34 too I got set about this and then you
47:37 know of course on this show we go a lot
47:38 deeper than an average conversation so
47:41 it started to frustrate him that he just
47:44 couldn't find problems and you know and
47:50 and so he started going with absolute
47:52 generalizations to try and make me fail
47:54 in the conversation which is to say you
47:56 know do you is your life perfect you
48:00 know part of me just wanted to go [ __ ]
48:03 you dude and your stupid [ __ ]
48:06 lowbrow techniques of trying to make me
48:09 feel broken so I'll sign up to your
48:11 shitty class right but I kept my
48:15 composure but I did tell him I believe I
48:18 told him I said I can see what you're
48:20 trying to do here I said obviously
48:22 you're projecting your own problems on
48:24 me you feel like you're broken and
48:27 you've been trying to fix yourself for a
48:28 long time and you haven't fixed yourself
48:31 so your perception of everyone else in
48:33 the world is you're projecting the fact
48:34 that you think we're all broken because
48:38 you can't fix you you can't fix you
48:40 right so you're trying to you know you
48:41 know I'm saying and it kind of stopped
48:44 him in his tracks and he kind of kind of
48:47 you know gave it the 60 seconds of
48:49 courteous nodding and then
48:53 oh I gotta tuck this person I'll be
48:54 right back right and of course he's gone
48:57 but that little technique that that guy
49:00 was doing on me in this little class I
49:02 think happens a lot and again if you
49:06 talk to individuals that are successful
49:10 in their own mind you know we can always
49:12 dream up something better and that's a
49:14 good thing not a bad thing a lot of
49:16 times you'll run into people well like
49:19 if you ran into me right we're talking
49:21 right now
49:22 well I've succeeded in virtually
49:25 everything I've ever tried right
49:27 virtually but I can always dream
49:33 something else up and so if you meet me
49:36 at a smoke lounge or a restaurant or in
49:38 public or whatever and you start telling
49:40 me about your life like well you know
49:41 I'm really trying to figure this damn
49:42 thing out I got a lot of skills and I've
49:44 done a few things and I've even done
49:45 some things that are amazing I've
49:47 succeeded too but I'm sort of in a in a
49:50 rut
49:50 I've sort of been a writer's block of my
49:52 own life and I just may be talking to
49:56 you was this kind of shake things out of
49:57 me right of course I go after your
49:59 themes like I said you know I said well
50:00 what turns you on the most what makes
50:02 you get out of bed right a good
50:05 complimentary episode of this one is how
50:08 to get a job which is way back in season
50:10 one someone just commented on it said he
50:14 really liked it and I was like oh man I
50:15 haven't seen this episode in a long time
50:17 and I watched it and it's one of my
50:19 finer hours but if you run into someone
50:22 successful they don't try to tear you
50:24 down to build you up right now you know
50:29 I ran into a guy the other day who I
50:33 only see him about once every quarter
50:35 and I see him at this place and he will
50:41 show up drunk
50:43 not quite falling down drunk he still
50:46 drives his car which is really scary but
50:50 he comes and he's kind of slurry and
50:51 thing is is you look at him he looks
50:54 great
50:55 he looks really tighten in his clothing
50:57 he's a handsome gentleman not stupid at
51:00 all but he's drinking because then he
51:03 told me you know his life has been tough
51:04 about five years solid so he's drinking
51:06 I tried to get him onto cigars as I said
51:09 look why don't you save your money man
51:10 if you want to calm down and talk to
51:12 people I said you need social
51:14 interaction you know you don't need
51:15 drinking interaction right and I think
51:19 you know I haven't seen him since I was
51:20 hoping he stumbled back in and one way
51:23 or another but we talked and I know him
51:30 enough I've seen him probably four or
51:31 five times and had some very detailed
51:33 conversations about his life and his
51:35 skill set and he came back and even
51:39 though he's tipsy down by the time I got
51:40 you know got done with the conversation
51:42 and we're in the parking lot just kind
51:45 of saying goodbye for the evening and
51:47 he's looking right at me he's got the
51:48 biggest size man he staring right at me
51:50 and I'm just reminding him of who he is
51:53 because I know him that well and I made
51:56 some suggestions about you know we just
51:58 changed this one little thing here cuz
52:00 he's complaining that he's drinking too
52:01 much and I said fine at least you know
52:04 so why don't you just do me a favor and
52:06 try this other thing try at least coming
52:09 in and talking to some of us because
52:10 we've all been there
52:11 and when you talk to people who have
52:13 been there you know you know that
52:16 they've been there because there's just
52:18 a look and there's a phraseology and a
52:21 methodology and a tone to the voice of
52:25 whether or not you're talking of
52:26 someone's BS in you but what he's doing
52:29 is I believe he's trying to go for the
52:31 big lottery ticket the big payout at the
52:33 end of the day right thing is is if you
52:38 think about a lottery ticket formula to
52:41 life you're gonna do this one thing and
52:42 then you're gonna make a ton of money
52:43 and then you'll be completely out of the
52:45 game be able to do whatever you want
52:47 with life go wherever you want eat
52:48 whatever you want to do all those things
52:50 that the fancy car fancy house that's
52:53 asking a lot of the universe isn't it
52:56 that's almost like asking the universe
52:59 to balance a galaxy on the tip of a
53:01 needle yeah I guess it could happen but
53:04 probably not likely it's probably best
53:08 that one just hunker down find something
53:12 you love that generates money usually if
53:16 you love something again it's a little
53:18 tough if you play video games
53:20 all the time and that's what makes you
53:21 happy there are jobs where you play
53:23 video games you just need to look at how
53:26 much money you need and see if a QA job
53:28 a quality assurance job is going to get
53:29 you that kind of paycheck but maybe if
53:32 that you know makes you happy makes you
53:38 thrilled with life maybe I'll take the
53:40 studio apartment or rent the room from
53:42 somebody so you can play video games all
53:44 day long but I've rarely met a kid who
53:47 likes to play video games a lot that
53:48 doesn't have a side dream of creating
53:52 them of designing them right but they
53:55 don't think they can for some reason I
53:57 think there's a special gene pool and I
54:00 will say there's definitely a special
54:02 level of attention you must pay two
54:04 things to get there it's really funny
54:07 when I went back for some of my class
54:09 reunions back in my hometown there's a
54:13 lot of families there that there's
54:16 nothing special I mean there's special
54:19 things of course but there's nothing
54:20 like with the the standard arc of fame
54:23 and money and all these things that
54:25 doesn't happen in my hometown right but
54:28 I will tell you this I saw dozens and
54:31 dozens of my friends from high school
54:32 who never left the little tiny town that
54:35 I came from about big beautiful homes
54:38 every amenity in that house that you
54:40 could possibly imagine good intelligent
54:43 sort of rule of hiding children right
54:46 you have promising education and hobbies
54:49 they're going to go right into college
54:50 with the major they know about and they
54:53 didn't subscribe I think to the [ __ ]
54:56 and so they lived and live to this day a
55:01 wonderful life and I think that you know
55:06 with this episode it's sort of aimed at
55:09 two different groups of people you know
55:14 it all starts out with you're in the
55:15 group that is in angst about your
55:17 success that's the whole group within
55:21 that group there are folks out there
55:24 that I think should really rethink how
55:29 wonderful life is going to be if you
55:32 have this one-in-a-million thing
55:33 I think that you might want to resale
55:36 yourself the notion that there's this
55:38 lottery ticket out there waiting for you
55:40 again you can't you can't make the ac/dc
55:46 album back and black by sitting there in
55:48 the studio going we're gonna make a ton
55:50 up we're gonna make an album that makes
55:51 tons of money that's our objective here
55:53 hell no they sat down and said we want
55:57 to make the best rock and roll songs on
55:59 planet Earth I think that album has like
56:02 eight or ten songs on it but it's the
56:04 best rock and roll album of all time per
56:07 capita of each song and its impact on
56:10 society how many times you've heard it
56:12 in public there's none better and they
56:16 have reaped the rewards for creating
56:18 such an amazing out of course they had
56:20 great tunes before their great Tunes
56:21 after so obviously they're doing
56:22 something right
56:23 with the overall configuration of the
56:26 band itself but you don't get good at
56:29 anything if you're not focused on the
56:32 exact thing that you're trying to get
56:34 good at and how can you get good good at
56:37 any skill if all you're focusing on is
56:38 the external reward that is money as a
56:40 result of doing it you know I've seen
56:45 the tech industry what I that I've been
56:48 close to evolve like crazy and I've seen
56:52 folks well I've had my friends and
56:54 employees or a child you know you employ
56:58 them for a little while then they leave
57:00 whatever reason and you loop back with
57:02 them later hey how you doing man well
57:05 I'm totally into this
57:07 well why into that well because it is
57:08 the industry standard I'm gonna make a
57:10 ton of money I'm gonna get the biggest
57:12 paycheck for this and I'm gonna tell you
57:15 only a small percentage of people that
57:18 ever tell me that line ever really
57:20 succeed in that new industry and that
57:23 new thing because what they're doing is
57:25 is as they're trying to learn and focus
57:27 on what they're doing they're spending
57:30 too much time in their brain focusing on
57:32 the reward at the end of the tunnel now
57:35 sometimes I can be exactly what you need
57:37 right Tony Robbins teaches you to to
57:40 repaint in a remap positive and negative
57:42 and then where you're positive is you've
57:43 got to see the light at the end of the
57:45 tunnel I believe that's exactly what he
57:46 says
57:47 and use that as a beacon to do the right
57:49 thing right I want to live in a world
57:53 with a bunch of really happy people and
57:57 I think that the reality of the human
58:01 body is that you can't live in a
58:06 constant orgasm your whole life you
58:09 can't do it for a minute right your old
58:12 face can't stay on your face forever
58:14 you're going to have to come down to a
58:17 beautiful average mean of happiness that
58:21 is sustainable that is sustainable with
58:23 the amount of energy your body's going
58:25 to metabolize that of food and you know
58:28 what dopamine and adrenaline can drop
58:31 into your mind on a routine basis
58:33 there's got to be peaks and valleys
58:35 within your positive stream so you're
58:37 still you're still over neutral there's
58:40 gonna be these moments when you get a
58:41 little bump of positivity and yeah
58:43 didn't work well that's okay we always
58:46 just change our strategy and create a
58:48 new peak right you know I've been enough
58:52 households where the parents had tons of
58:54 kids five kids six kids and you look at
58:58 the whole room and you you know like
59:00 I've dated girls with beautiful families
59:02 and and there's always these back
59:05 stories on the way over to the first
59:06 meeting of the parents well you know
59:07 this sister was really strange here and
59:09 this brother was kind of weird there and
59:11 they have different fathers and and boy
59:14 that my parents used to fight a lot but
59:15 now they don't fight anymore and all
59:17 this other stuff they get all this back
59:18 story of the struggle of bringing
59:20 together this amazing family and so it's
59:22 all kind of dark and mysterious and
59:24 chaotic in my brain I don't know quite
59:26 how to greet anyone is anyone still
59:28 hanging on to the negativity I heard
59:30 when I first wasn't when I was driving
59:32 over here and I walked through the door
59:34 and of course people our best behavior
59:35 but if you're if you can read people
59:38 pretty good you know who's imitating and
59:40 who's actually on deck right and last
59:44 time experienced this the whole family
59:45 was amazing I mean every single person
59:48 was phenomenal loving the parents were
59:52 way past any of their troubles and just
59:56 a beautiful thing but in the back of my
59:59 mind I'm thinking wow
60:00 think of all the arguments and all the
60:02 turmoil of raising kids of all different
60:05 ages to get to this point and now
60:08 they're just on cruise control the
60:10 parents are sitting there and their 70s
60:12 just looking around the room going man I
60:14 made five great kids and they happen to
60:17 marry five great people and the
60:20 grandkids are all amazing grandkids you
60:23 know no one's perfect but they're
60:26 sitting in a level of success that I
60:28 think is just as complex as an
60:30 entrepreneur creating a business you
60:33 know some eBay or some PayPal or
60:35 something like that right the other
60:38 thing to remember is that luck has a lot
60:40 a lot to do with certain levels of mega
60:43 success right the the thing I you know I
60:49 bumped into a lot when I moved to
60:52 California was that you know I was 18
60:57 very quickly after I got here and again
60:59 I'm totally solo by myself no cash
61:01 coming in from the family to support me
61:03 anything like that and so I'm hanging
61:06 out with some of the most amazing
61:08 eighteen year olds I like I worked in
61:11 gym l racing
61:13 which is a racing course by Jim Hall jr.
61:15 in Ventura for a really short bit then I
61:17 got into the tax software I got the
61:19 video games so I'm hanging out with kids
61:21 that are set 18 years old they're
61:24 sponsored by you know Firestone and
61:26 Pirelli and all these crazy you know
61:29 race car manufacturers and then you know
61:33 I was hanging out with dudes that had
61:35 made a lot of money in software one of
61:37 my friends I rented a room from was
61:39 slightly younger than me so I meet him
61:41 just man I must be like three months
61:44 into being a teen this kid I met him on
61:45 his 18th birthday I went to his retail
61:48 store in Camarillo walked around his
61:50 software store when they used to sell
61:52 you know brick-and-mortar software and
61:57 he was closing deals sixty thousand
62:00 dollar deals with the military 80 1987
62:03 at just 18 years old he had a beautiful
62:07 car out front again I'm renting a room
62:09 in his house now his dad fronted him 25
62:12 grand to start
62:13 company belief and which is a lot of
62:17 money but honestly he parlayed that
62:19 thing up very quickly by himself
62:21 tenacious guy he eventually got into
62:24 video games
62:25 oddly enough learn how to program and I
62:29 think sold his company probably was from
62:32 shareholders but the rumor was he sold
62:33 it for four hundred million dollars
62:36 right so when I was 18 hanging around
62:39 these other guys that weren't taking no
62:42 for an answer when it came to life and I
62:44 sat there and when Jesus I got no excuse
62:46 not to do my very best to what I can do
62:48 right but it's a you know when you go
62:52 off on those worlds it's very tough to
62:55 live a normal life and you pay a huge
62:59 price when it comes to isolation and
63:01 again you could be married with ten kids
63:03 and feel utterly disconnected and
63:05 isolated because the trials and
63:07 tribulations that you're fighting on a
63:08 daily basis are so over the head of your
63:11 kids and maybe even over the head of
63:13 your spouse that you can't come home and
63:16 really feel like you've been hurt and
63:19 you won't dislike your spouse or dislike
63:22 your children because they don't
63:23 understand you're just going to need an
63:25 alternate third party place to go to
63:28 have that conversation and I've seen
63:32 several marriages in my lifetime go
63:35 belly-up because of this formula where
63:39 the husband or the wife they're hanging
63:43 out with in their business circles and
63:45 they go home and there's nothing that
63:46 their spouse can do to understand them
63:48 so they meet someone of the opposite sex
63:50 or whatever sex they prefer they start
63:53 engaging they start having like-minded
63:55 conversations and they you know what I
63:57 can't go home to my wife or my husband
63:59 anymore I got it
64:01 let's let's hook up let's do our thing
64:03 and they end up cheating on the side for
64:05 a little while and then they inform
64:07 their spouse that they're leaving them
64:08 and of course the kids are destroyed
64:10 depending on how old they are
64:12 and it's a rough ride and this
64:17 serendipitously happened a lot I think
64:20 in the 80s when you know being an
64:22 entrepreneur is one of the only ways to
64:24 really create any job
64:27 you know one of the other things I was
64:30 told and again you have to listen
64:33 between the lines when I was working on
64:38 my first video games which was a
64:41 subsidiary of Activision this guy showed
64:43 up at our studio which is a beach house
64:45 in Oxnard California and he wasn't
64:50 really related to our company in terms
64:52 of tasks and stuff we're doing he was
64:54 just a friend of someone and he was
65:00 probably in his mid 40s and he looked at
65:03 me and he said he was having some
65:05 existing talking to someone else in the
65:07 room but then he you know when someone
65:09 turns to you and finishes a sentence you
65:10 feel like it's all pointed at you was
65:12 one of those kind of moments and he said
65:13 you know I realized why should I work
65:16 eight hours for someone else when I can
65:19 work twelve hours for myself and right
65:23 off the bat at first I'm like oh yeah
65:25 sure man we should all work for
65:26 ourselves and edit it out right but what
65:29 I really didn't hear at the time at
65:31 whatever nineteen years old when I heard
65:33 this was you're working 12 hours a day
65:37 what he also didn't mention was every
65:41 day of the year
65:43 weekend's weekdays holidays right
65:48 there's no rest for the wicked' right as
65:52 they say there's no rest for an
65:53 entrepreneur that's on their own you
65:56 have to work around the clock constantly
65:58 because there's always some [ __ ] coming
66:00 up usually yeah it's not the truth for
66:03 everyone again some folks in my hometown
66:05 again we had tons of little businesses
66:07 we had a welding family we had a car
66:11 repair family car sales family they had
66:14 managed to work out over 20 30 years
66:16 a beautiful pipeline or they didn't have
66:19 to work on the weekends now the guy that
66:21 sold cars definitely had to sell cars on
66:24 Saturday and Sunday but then they just
66:26 build a workforce where they don't have
66:28 to do it personally I tell you that
66:30 because I want you to understand the
66:33 very depths of what this sort of bigger
66:37 than life success that you might be
66:40 angsting to try entails it's brutal
66:45 and I mean brutal
66:49 unless you're fortunate right but I
66:53 think that no matter how fortunate you
66:54 are unless you're just absolutely in the
66:56 right place at the right time
66:58 it's brutal enough that you'll say that
67:03 brutal is sort of the average feeling
67:07 you're gonna have right whatever you
67:10 would define as a higher struggle than
67:13 brutal is it's fairly familiar to you
67:18 you'll run into that realm as well
67:20 it's almost abusive you know I mean it's
67:23 like a brutal is pretty bad but you know
67:25 it's sort of a last-man-standing art to
67:29 really fight for it and I will tell you
67:32 that you know in my in my last couple
67:36 years I've learned something very
67:37 interesting that I thought I would pass
67:39 on to you just to give you kind of a
67:41 sort of an inside track to what you
67:43 might run into that you have not run
67:47 into yet I've met some people that are
67:52 extremely wealthy which obviously means
67:54 and they're self-made okay no one gave
67:57 them anything and they work their ass
67:58 off and of course there was a level of
68:01 success I should say luck involved with
68:06 their success they were at the right
68:07 place at the right time right doesn't
68:09 mean they didn't work their asses off
68:11 okay but they just had a kind of a
68:13 perfect mix of time and place and you
68:21 know I've worked with these individuals
68:22 to raise money for some of my own
68:23 efforts and there's an interesting thing
68:25 that they they kind of had this kind of
68:28 unwritten rule which is if you don't
68:31 have a bunch of money and I made a bunch
68:33 of money no matter what you've done with
68:35 your life they pretty much start
68:40 listening to you with the third strike
68:41 already in their head they look at you
68:44 and they say well if you're so smart
68:46 then why aren't you rich and at first it
68:50 sounds super kind of offensive you know
68:52 you're like what do you mean you
68:53 just because I don't worship money I'm
68:55 an idiot you know and when you really
68:59 think about it for a little while
69:01 there's a little bit of truth no matter
69:02 how cynical you want to be about their
69:04 opinion and their myopic focus on money
69:08 what they really tell you is money's
69:11 very hard to make it is and if they are
69:16 fortunate enough to amass millions tens
69:20 of millions hundreds of millions of
69:21 money they work their ass off for it and
69:25 if you're going to ask for their money
69:27 to be donated to your effort you need to
69:30 prove that you understand what you're
69:33 asking for because if you don't take it
69:36 away from their purse and risk it they
69:39 could give it to their family members
69:40 they could spend it on their own
69:42 adventure their own next idea it's not
69:45 your idea right and so there's this
69:48 interesting kind of come-to-jesus moment
69:52 with the worshipping of money and the
69:57 collecting of money you sort of exit the
70:01 old way of thinking we're just having a
70:03 family and that porch swing and some
70:06 wood you know fiddle on or Whittle on
70:10 you live in more of a mathematical world
70:13 which has very little emotion sure if
70:17 you succeed you're not a lot of good
70:18 emotion but let me tell you until you
70:20 succeed it's not neutral it's sort of
70:24 negative it's a struggle because it's
70:27 your job to be cynical about what you
70:30 think you're going to do you can be very
70:32 optimistic and create the reality
70:33 distortion field around yourself to get
70:35 things done and you should and the
70:38 reality distortion field for people that
70:40 are wealthy is one of a complete
70:44 productivity you can't walk into a room
70:47 with some folks in the world and say
70:48 that you can't do it or that it can't be
70:51 done because their entire life they have
70:55 neglected or I should say they have
70:58 refused to allow that opinion to be a
71:01 part of their life they're like you know
71:03 what I made my whole life out of
71:04 everything that was impossible so don't
71:07 tell me things are impossible and you
71:11 know what they're right you know I said
71:14 a long time ago on the show one of the
71:16 other themes that I love is to do the
71:19 impossible the people thing can't be
71:21 done I love it
71:22 and once you start thinking in your
71:24 brain that everything that people think
71:26 is impossible is possible
71:28 man it's a it's a great life you won't
71:31 always find the solution right away just
71:32 because you have that opinion but you
71:35 will pull things out of yourself that
71:37 you never thought you were capable of
71:39 doing and it doesn't have to be a big
71:43 giant multi-million dollar corporation
71:45 you're creating it could be as simple as
71:47 you are in that second category we're
71:50 living a wonderful life with your family
71:51 maybe that maybe right now you don't
71:54 even appreciate it but after listening
71:56 to this maybe you kind of put the pieces
71:57 together you know yeah you know what I
71:59 do have an awesome life I just thought
72:01 maybe there was something out there that
72:03 was better than what I already had but
72:04 you know confirming that it's not out
72:07 there or if it's out there it's not
72:09 worth the trouble maybe gives you some
72:12 solace but maybe the thing that you
72:15 think is impossible is something as
72:16 simple as your spouse is going to bring
72:19 you a very challenging piece of
72:21 information something that you wouldn't
72:24 think you'd be able to hear and tolerate
72:26 perhaps even stay with them somehow you
72:30 do and that becomes your defining moment
72:32 as a hero the decision you make under
72:36 pressure right maybe your spouse ran off
72:40 with a bunch of money and went and
72:42 bought something they weren't supposed
72:43 to buy maybe it's frivolous and stupid
72:45 maybe it's a business adventure that
72:47 they want to go out and do or maybe they
72:50 weren't faithful right that's actually a
72:55 really good one being unfaithful you
72:56 think there's no way I could ever hear
72:58 about my spouse being unfaithful ever
73:01 keep the relationship going obviously if
73:03 they want to leave they're gonna go
73:04 ahead and leave but if they're like oh
73:06 my god I slipped it's so stupid I just
73:09 feel awful and I now learn my lesson buh
73:12 buh buh yeah obviously you do it
73:13 multiple times you might want to
73:15 reconsider but don't let other people
73:18 infect your mind unless you agree with
73:20 it
73:20 I think about it very deeply right I
73:24 hope this show has stayed very
73:28 consistent with the notion that you know
73:30 my opinions are my opinions and you're
73:32 encouraged to to totally disagree and
73:37 love what you love that's completely
73:38 contrary to what I like and refree you
73:42 know reinforce yourself fortify right we
73:46 need the world to be happy we need the
73:49 world to be productive I think we need
73:53 the world to create things whether it be
73:55 people moments of happiness random acts
73:58 of kindness improve themselves or they
74:02 thought they couldn't improve themselves
74:04 you know it's just sort of a digression
74:06 along those lines we see all the time
74:10 especially on the internet folks that
74:11 are either born with disabilities or
74:13 inherent disabilities due to a tragic
74:15 accident or some illness maybe they lose
74:17 a limb a leg a hand something that they
74:21 think prior to that moment they couldn't
74:23 possibly continue life not having those
74:26 things obviously but the video that you
74:30 see in your you know your facebook home
74:32 feed is all about someone who either you
74:38 know they just they got there but they
74:40 went ahead move past it and were able to
74:42 continue life as if it didn't happen
74:44 they found different ways around it
74:46 right celebrate the tiny micro successes
74:51 that you have in your life every single
74:52 day the fact that you wake up in the
74:56 morning is one success brush your teeth
74:58 in the morning if you got all your teeth
75:00 well that's another little success if
75:02 your body is generally the size that
75:05 you're okay with or you're on your way
75:06 to the perfect shape that you want to be
75:08 well every day is a little tiny success
75:11 if your car starts in the morning that's
75:14 a success you collect your paycheck
75:15 that's the success if your child smiles
75:18 and laughs a true wholehearted laugh
75:21 that's a success right
75:26 don't worry about the big ones you
75:29 hunker down in something that you love
75:31 all that big stuff money and fame if
75:34 that's something that you think you're
75:35 interested in I assure you fame is not
75:37 something that you want go see my
75:39 episode on Fame money well I've seen it
75:43 corrupt absolute man I've seen it
75:46 destroy people's lives I've seen it set
75:49 standards higher than anyone could
75:50 maintain they blow it all and they lose
75:53 it I've seen them stock pilot and bank
75:57 accounts and they're just unhappy people
76:00 just grumpy all the time because in
76:04 their mind they worked super hard which
76:05 they are correct but there's always
76:08 somebody wanting to take it you know and
76:11 I as person whose need investment from
76:13 time to time I've been the person that
76:15 has to be the next person in line that
76:17 says well you know we're looking for
76:19 funds and you know if you're an investor
76:22 the night I hope that you've dealt with
76:24 the fact that we need you to part with
76:26 some of your money and I've made the
76:29 mistake of asking for too much money and
76:31 I made the mistake of accepting too
76:33 little money but it's always based on
76:37 the personality of the person that I'm
76:39 looking across the table at I hope you
76:42 feel me hope this was useful we could
76:44 probably do two or three parts on
76:46 success I just wanted to get the
76:49 fundamentals out the door so you can
76:52 take that moment of angst and and
76:54 instead of it just being a ball of inks
76:57 that is almost impossible to look in to
77:00 be able to zoom it up look inside it and
77:03 go you know what this whole ball of
77:06 angst I have is really just a bunch of
77:08 [ __ ] it doesn't really have any
77:11 substance it's really kind of an
77:13 ignition Tenny form it doesn't have any
77:16 direction it's just me thinking oh my
77:19 god you know I turn on the television
77:21 and I see these morons get these reality
77:25 shows and boy it looks like they're so
77:26 happy if you think anyone's happy on a
77:29 reality show wait a couple years and
77:31 going to tmz.com and see how their life
77:33 is being absolutely ripped apart by the
77:35 public
77:37 I can't go in public without having
77:40 photographs taken of them and the funny
77:41 thing is is that on average 99% of
77:44 people on reality shows or nobody's
77:46 before the reality show started and
77:48 there really nothing more than a nobody
77:51 afterwards they just become oddities for
77:53 reality you know for folks that want to
77:56 see other people suffer I guess before I
77:59 sign off let me do this one more thing
78:01 at you because it just occurred to me
78:02 it's very very important I've said it in
78:05 other episodes but since we're on the
78:06 subject that's repeated if you're really
78:08 successful there are some people around
78:11 you that will be in competition with you
78:13 and they won't really consciously know
78:16 they're in competition with you they'll
78:19 just resent the fact that you're
78:20 succeeding and they wish they were in
78:22 your shoes and sometimes they go through
78:25 stages where they resent you at first
78:27 and then they support you sometimes it's
78:30 the opposite they support you and the
78:32 more you succeed they resent you
78:34 sometimes folks will be in utter pain
78:36 and they think you're rolling in cash
78:38 and they want you to subsidize their
78:40 lives which doesn't fix anything right
78:43 being broke as I've said several times
78:45 on different shows is the mother of
78:46 invention it gets you to that next level
78:49 so if you live a balanced life you got
78:53 the softball games for your daughter and
78:55 the baseball games for your son sure
78:58 there's little microcosms of of envy
79:01 here and there keeping up with the
79:02 Joneses keeping up appearances and all
79:04 that kind of crap but if you think
79:08 that's bad go be a successful
79:11 entrepreneur sometimes they get thrilled
79:14 to share the experience with you and
79:16 sometimes there's this weird silence
79:19 where they're just saying god how can I
79:21 think hit that guy out of his success or
79:23 don't ever have to hear it again
79:25 you know it got to a point where before
79:29 I even went to my ten year anniversary
79:30 for high school I showed up well I had
79:34 already figured it out and I was like
79:35 okay the most annoying thing you can do
79:38 at a reunion is to go and talk about
79:40 yourself and it was funny because we had
79:43 a few people that did exactly that I
79:45 just walked up and said what are you
79:48 doing with your life and I was like
79:50 talking to Farva
79:51 from Super Troopers you start talking
79:56 and then like two words in your sins
79:58 they're immediately on top of you
79:59 telling you what they did because they
80:00 really just want to talk about
80:01 themselves right but luckily everyone I
80:04 know from my class mature it out of that
80:06 there's only a couple people really
80:07 living on that but you get to the point
80:10 where you you might succeed so much that
80:12 you'd really don't want to tell anybody
80:13 anything about what you do because you
80:15 don't make anyone feel bad just
80:16 depending on what they're doing and then
80:19 you have that great human being in the
80:21 world that just cheers you want they
80:23 love what you're doing they feel awesome
80:26 about what you do and they know that you
80:29 feel the same way about them right but
80:32 I've got friends of mine who have that
80:33 type B life where they have this
80:35 beautiful family this beautiful job they
80:38 live in a great area of the world and
80:40 they don't think that there is success
80:42 and so when you ask them what they do
80:44 they kind of have well you know what I'm
80:46 doing I'm just doing the old
80:47 nine-to-five bubble and they think that
80:49 they're a failure sorta sort of down
80:51 inside they feel like they they had the
80:53 sort of the skillset to be something
80:56 bigger than what they ended up and
80:58 they're not willing to celebrate the
80:59 amazing successes that they've had and
81:01 I'm always the guy that says well you've
81:04 got what I want and you think I've got
81:07 what you want I guarantee you we're both
81:10 full of [ __ ] right right we should be
81:13 happy for what we've been able to cram
81:15 into this little life of ours where we
81:18 get 80 years if you're lucky 100 years
81:20 of you're super lucky but I mean [ __ ]
81:23 even if you're lived to be a hundred I
81:24 don't know how much new [ __ ] you can do
81:27 after 80 I've got some friends who do it
81:29 but again if you're young you're in your
81:33 20s here and me it's time to go baby
81:36 it's time to go get going
81:39 roll with it take risks have fun don't
81:42 risk your life hopefully we get out
81:45 there and fail and pick yourself back up
81:47 and succeed and then fail then you know
81:50 whatever you got to do because by the
81:52 time you hit your 30s you're gonna
81:54 probably meet somebody you're gonna meet
81:56 someone and you're going to want to
81:58 start settling down
81:59 and if you haven't taken care of those
82:01 risks and and those successes and those
82:04 failures and all that good stuff before
82:05 you're 30 trying to do that from scratch
82:08 and your 30s is really rough but here's
82:11 the here's the beautiful part Paul
82:13 Harvey to the story if you have done
82:17 nothing but fail in your 20s but you
82:19 risked and you tried by the time you get
82:22 to your 30s you can continue going in
82:25 that algorithm because you have
82:27 mechanisms in your mind that work and
82:31 you're like now I could do the same sort
82:33 of thing this sort of entrepreneurial
82:34 risk thing but I don't have to spend so
82:38 much energy doing it because I know how
82:40 to work smarter so what took ten
82:43 calories takes one calorie now and I
82:46 know when to get in and then when to
82:47 pull out and I know when to plan I know
82:49 how long to plan so that with the time
82:52 and money I have left in my life which
82:56 would be your time around your family or
82:57 whatever your relationship you've got
83:00 enough time but there's a lot of
83:02 incredibly successful people they didn't
83:04 start anything until their late 20s
83:06 early 30s
83:07 so don't think that what I'm saying is
83:09 somehow an absolute there's no hard rule
83:12 about anyone succeeding in this world
83:15 there are actors that didn't act one day
83:17 until they were in their 40s and then
83:19 there's other ones that didn't act until
83:21 their 50s and they became household
83:23 words right all right there you go deep
83:27 thoughts radio calm for all the feeds
83:29 there's video if you're on audio audio
83:31 if you're on video YouTube and Vimeo
83:33 video there's iTunes Google Play and the
83:37 website for the RSS feed we have a
83:40 locked Facebook group just search on
83:42 deep thoughts radio and you'll find it I
83:45 think that's the URL actually I think
83:48 like I created a page for it and then I
83:50 created a group and I think page ate up
83:53 the custom URL let's just go to the
83:55 website click on Facebook if you want to
83:57 get in a lot of great folks it's about
84:00 80% shares from you guys and about 20%
84:04 from me so it's not just coming and
84:08 listening to a dude you know
84:09 indoctrinate you
84:11 so anyway take care of yourself and
84:13 someone else and I'll see you in the
84:14 next deep thoughts
