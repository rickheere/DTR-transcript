00:33 ladies and gentlemen walk back to deep
00:35 thoughts today I thought I would cover a
00:40 mentor of mine a friend of mine I would
00:44 say a family member of mine that I have
00:46 spent the last 20 years roughly hanging
00:50 out with a unit's partner Roger his
00:54 gentleman's this gentleman's name is Syd
00:56 Mead and I'm gonna keep this episode a
01:01 little different than my other episodes
01:04 and then it'll be hopefully extremely
01:06 clean because some of you might run into
01:10 this and you have no idea about this
01:12 show and what I'm trying to do here
01:14 most the time we learn about our
01:17 historical geniuses after they're gone
01:23 you read about them in history books
01:25 and you read about them through you know
01:29 biographies that people try to construct
01:31 out of you know hearsay and perhaps a
01:34 little empirical evidence maybe the
01:37 artist wrote something down was
01:40 videotape was interviewed and you just
01:42 sit there and watch it all and try to
01:43 you know put it all together
01:47 the beautiful thing about the present
01:50 and probably the future moving forward
01:52 is that now it's going to be much much
01:54 easier to document some of our masters
01:58 Syd Mead in my opinion is nothing shy of
02:01 a DaVinci everything he touches turns to
02:04 gold every
02:09 fictional everything you know from his
02:11 sketches to his paintings some of you
02:15 may or may not have had a chance to read
02:17 fictional pieces from him but he's a
02:19 brilliant writer I mean and just he
02:22 could write Downton Abbey and he could
02:25 write some futuristic dune you know he's
02:31 that amazing and so I wanted to share
02:35 with you because he just came out with
02:37 his own autobiography called
02:39 a future remembered and what's cool
02:43 about this book is that you have it
02:45 written by him and he constructed the
02:48 book so he's an artist so he laid the
02:51 book out and he had what you have to
02:54 know about said we're gonna go through
02:55 his career in short here the book has
02:59 all the all the details it's
03:01 unbelievable the amount of extensive
03:04 coverage on this guy's life that's in
03:06 this book and having known him for the
03:07 better part of 20 years I will say that
03:10 I have seen dozens and dozens of
03:12 presentations I've had the privilege of
03:14 looking through his vault several times
03:18 and this book has all of the stuff I've
03:22 seen in presentations which I was you
03:24 know took my breath away of like oh my
03:26 god really you know like what is this
03:28 how come I haven't seen this before and
03:29 I've known you for 10 years 15 years 20
03:31 years and then it has more so it's
03:35 pretty cool but Sid is different so Sid
03:38 need for those of you who don't know him
03:41 at all as an artist he's probably most
03:44 famous for his contribution to Hollywood
03:47 in little tiny films like Star Trek the
03:51 motion picture Tron the one made in 1982
03:55 and so you know a lot of his designs
03:58 from 1982 were actually put into legacy
04:01 and beefed up Blade Runner
04:06 aliens which is the second one short
04:11 circuit robot he has done more recently
04:15 Blade Runner 2049 Elysium Tomorrowland
04:20 and again he doesn't write the scripts
04:22 folks so he just makes the vehicles
04:26 makes the world what he turned into
04:29 Marlon by the way they told him we're
04:31 gonna make Tomorrowland it doesn't even
04:33 Disneyland look like you're rendering
04:35 it's so beautiful
04:36 I think they've truly dropped the ball
04:40 on that at Disney because I even had Bob
04:42 Kerr tell me by 2013
04:45 Tomorrowland would be unrecognizable to
04:49 2007 and I assure you that is not the
04:52 case it looks completely like 2007 gene
04:56 Winfield who built the cars for a Blade
04:59 Runner which is what Sid was originally
05:02 hired to do and I'll get through all
05:03 these stories as much as I can
05:06 he probably said it best when he said
05:09 what Sid designs is real it's not
05:14 something silly you could really build
05:17 it if you had the propulsion system
05:20 citizen designing just some toy to look
05:23 cool in your movie and just kind of
05:25 throwing up his hands and going yeah
05:26 whatever he makes it work 100% and Sid
05:31 is really healthy today he's 20 18 he's
05:34 won 1933 he's gonna turn 85 in July he's
05:39 as bright as ever and he is an anomaly
05:44 he is an anomaly as a human being and
05:46 I'm gonna get to some details here
05:48 because you know me I'm not exactly the
05:51 most impressionable guy I don't look for
05:54 ghost stories so Sid has very distinct
05:59 stages of his life which he describes in
06:01 his book in the massive detail one of
06:04 the cool things he did with this book
06:05 was he went back and you know how when
06:08 you well depending on your age if you're
06:10 my age you're in your 40s or over when
06:13 you heard about your hero there's
06:15 nothing you could do but just watch TV
06:16 and hope that someone covered your hero
06:19 little bit more today you go to
06:21 Wikipedia you go to IMDB you just go to
06:25 their website you dig into their life if
06:26 you're some stalker you know and you
06:28 just where you born and when he so much
06:30 who your parents and Papa but it's all
06:31 this stuff so what Sid did was he he did
06:37 it to himself in this book each chapter
06:41 it covers the span of his life and what
06:43 he ends up doing is saying we lived in
06:45 this house and so he uses Google Maps to
06:48 go straight down to his house he
06:50 captures the actual location he I
06:53 believe in some cases captured modern
06:55 photographs of these homes and he shows
06:58 you the old photographs and he shows his
06:59 family at that stage I mean it's it's
07:02 really just awesome it's just a
07:04 brilliant priceless thing that just
07:06 recently come out here so Sid was born
07:08 in the Midwest and because of his
07:11 father's practice and the church
07:14 believed he was a preacher he's moved
07:16 around a little bit
07:17 he was always an artist always always an
07:21 artist I'm not sure anyone had to tell
07:23 this kid to be an artist he did claim to
07:27 me that you know his mom was a huge
07:29 provider enabler to get the supplies and
07:32 just think that way which is interesting
07:34 cuz it's I've heard this several times
07:36 dad's out making money and mom's
07:39 bringing home the goods now to put this
07:43 in perspective in terms of how talented
07:45 this kid was at 3 there's a very
07:50 definite stage that kids go through when
07:54 discovering how to render what's in
07:56 their mind to paper using any type of
07:59 writing implement write and usually they
08:04 scribble for a long time when they want
08:07 to create their first human they'll
08:08 create a big potato head and then the
08:10 legs and arms come off the potato head
08:12 and then eventually discover all there's
08:15 a body to I started to start drawing a
08:17 smaller disproportional thing down below
08:20 because the face for a child is huge
08:21 right so the face and the head is always
08:24 drawing large if we get to cars and
08:27 houses and that sort of stuff it's
08:29 usually four or five
08:32 and it's usually pretty crude at the age
08:35 of three Syd was drawing people in cars
08:37 and for the most part he got the
08:40 proportions completely correct even if
08:42 they were cartoon characters he got them
08:44 correct so he was well on his way to
08:49 becoming a genius in this and because
08:52 again it was in the 30s we're talking
08:55 about him drawing in 1936 right during
08:58 the Depression not a lot to do so he
09:04 renders and renders and drawers and
09:06 drawers
09:07 he drew buses he didn't just draw a bus
09:09 but he drew a bus with curtains at the
09:11 windows and everyone hanging out of it
09:13 right by the time he got to his
09:15 mid-teens said me could render a human
09:19 being perfectly he could render a car in
09:21 perspective he'd even built a car out of
09:25 cardboard that would blow your mind like
09:30 I've seen it several times and pictures
09:32 I don't think he still has it physically
09:34 in real life but I look at it and it
09:37 looks like someone did a you know
09:39 injection-molded was a tamia model I
09:43 mean this thing looks phenomenal
09:46 so his perception what's really key
09:49 about Syd is that his ability to see
09:52 things in 3d developed very early in the
09:56 model that he did of this old Model T
09:57 car or something like that made the
10:01 difference in his brain so one of the
10:05 most amazing things about said is his
10:07 ability to see things in 3d in his mind
10:11 so Syd you know a lot a lot of times
10:15 you'll see like the Star Destroyers in
10:17 Star Wars and it's just covered in pipes
10:20 right so the someone built a primitive
10:22 shape it was very interesting and then
10:24 there's just pipes and stuff and you
10:26 talked to the guys that actually built
10:27 those models and like yeah man we were
10:29 cutting up every tester model in the
10:33 world cutting up you know battleships
10:35 and cars and just putting mufflers on
10:37 there and sawn them down so that you
10:39 wouldn't really know what they were and
10:41 just making gobbledygook on the outside
10:44 Syd doesn't do that I said can make it
10:48 look equally complex but if you go Sid
10:51 what's his pipe for he's like oh that's
10:52 the environmental system that's yeah oh
10:54 that's the power system you know she's
10:56 his power coupling right here this
10:57 charges it up so this thing actually has
10:59 enough power to get going he's always
11:01 been like that
11:02 said enlisted in the army I think he
11:06 sent to Okinawa he serves time he is
11:13 heavily celebrated comes back he goes
11:17 the Arts Center Arts Center is at the
11:19 time he went to Art Center it was a
11:21 little house
11:22 a collection of houses or something in
11:24 Pasadena and passes you now has built a
11:26 full-fledged college now Sid as he said
11:30 didn't go to Art Center to learn how to
11:32 draw I'm not sure Art Center really can
11:35 teach anyone how to draw I've actually
11:36 accidentally said that recently but they
11:40 teach you the process of being a
11:41 professional artist and that's extremely
11:44 important how do you manage yourself
11:47 how'd you become a professional well
11:50 they definitely put you next to people
11:51 that will kick your ass in terms of
11:53 illustrating and then you have to have
11:54 the gumption to say oh I see what you're
11:57 doing to create that reflection oh I see
11:59 what you're doing and so you learn the
12:01 cliches of design and they keep you
12:03 moving to the next level in Art Center
12:06 for those of you have never heard of the
12:08 place if I said you had a degree from
12:10 Harvard okay you know that your ability
12:13 to get a job and medicine or law just
12:17 quadrupled same thing with art centered
12:21 you've got a degree from Art Center you
12:22 have a higher chance of getting a job
12:25 you still have to bring the talent right
12:27 a lot of kids you know their parents
12:30 have money and they can pass the grade
12:32 to get through they never really
12:35 natively have anything magical but if
12:38 you're a normal person getting in and
12:40 using your portfolio to get through art
12:41 center you will have the skills to
12:45 dominate the planet
12:46 our Center also creates most of the car
12:49 designers in the world as I understand
12:50 it although think that's changing as the
12:52 internet proliferate style a little bit
12:54 better but after Art Center say goes to
12:58 Ford automotive company and you know the
13:03 real details about this are in the book
13:04 but the the story I've heard a couple
13:07 times from him is that he was at lunch I
13:09 believe and he had everyone had cubicles
13:13 and so he set up a bunch of his artwork
13:16 in his cubicle on the first day and the
13:22 he went out to lunch and so the head of
13:25 design came through you know I guess
13:29 saying hello to everyone looks into
13:30 since Cuban goes who's this who sits
13:34 here well that's the new kid sit he's
13:35 like have him pack up his stuff and
13:38 bring it to my office it's sort of how
13:41 the story goes and then he was
13:43 immediately made sort of a VIP designer
13:46 at the company and he ended up sort of
13:51 jet-setting around and really handling
13:53 special ops designs within for moto
13:56 company we're building up to the
13:59 Hollywood stuff cuz we're gonna get into
14:00 the anatomy of why what he does is very
14:03 very special I'm skipping over that
14:08 giving you a brief history of his life
14:11 which is covered in extreme detail in
14:13 this book a future remembered he then
14:17 breaks out after a few years and
14:19 realizes that he can make more money
14:21 working for himself go figure
14:24 right he is so freakin successful he
14:28 ends up buying himself a Mercedes
14:29 Goldwing which is in the car Eric's
14:32 writing the book I've actually written
14:33 in that car before he got rid of it and
14:34 Wow
14:36 he gets a couple contracts he gets a
14:39 contract with US Steel US Steel is the
14:42 same company that exists today it makes
14:44 American steel and what they hired SIDS
14:47 company to do which is basically Sid and
14:49 his partner as it said would render
14:54 fantasy worlds in the future using steel
14:57 you know thrust
14:59 visions into the mind of the populace of
15:02 how the stuff could be used it is one of
15:04 the most sought-after art collections
15:07 ever published in the United States of
15:09 America the u.s. SteelSeries people are
15:15 finding these things at swap meets flea
15:17 markets they are selling their
15:20 individual pages on eBay sometimes the
15:23 whole book you'll find that the most
15:27 influential designers in the world are
15:30 secretly trying to find every copy of
15:33 this series and I'm not even sure Syd
15:35 has all the series himself said made one
15:40 really important distinction in his
15:44 contracts very early in life which is
15:45 that you can have our a copy of the
15:48 final rendering via a photograph or
15:50 computer scan but you can't have the
15:52 original it's only a couple little
15:54 exceptions with them so we're gonna loop
15:56 back on this so don't worry in terms of
15:58 the composition and why it's amazing
16:00 you work for Phillips the company that
16:03 makes the televisions they made all
16:04 kinds of things I mean from coffee
16:06 makers to all kinds of stuff and Syd
16:08 just made everything look better by an
16:12 order of magnitude Syd stuff is so good
16:17 and so futuristic and so amazing that it
16:19 once you learned how he thinks and how
16:22 he designs and you don't necessarily
16:24 have to understand on a conscious level
16:27 you can see a Sid illustration
16:30 immediately feel it in your chest like
16:32 oh my god looks like Syd there are a
16:35 couple exceptions where I've actually
16:38 misunderstood a design that wasn't SIDS
16:42 and I actually tell you right now
16:44 because it's generally in the same era
16:47 Syd worked on 2010 a Space Odyssey with
16:51 Peter Hyams he did not work with Kubrick
16:53 on 2001 a Space Odyssey but when I see
16:57 the Odyssey design when I see the pod
16:59 designs and when I see house design it's
17:03 very Syd Mead looking it's very
17:06 interesting but it was not Syd mean the
17:07 other one that looks extremely Syd Mead
17:09 are essentially all the prop
17:13 and the fonts and the the number designs
17:18 of the movie rollerball from 1975 with
17:20 James Caan I thought that might have
17:22 been Sid Sid wasn't in the film business
17:25 during either one of those movies very
17:30 shortly after Bleuler ball he got in so
17:34 this sid is cranking out US Steel books
17:36 he's cranking out Phillips designs which
17:38 we wouldn't see because they weren't
17:40 necessarily published anywhere now he
17:42 has them that he puts in his
17:44 presentations and sometimes his books
17:46 but in swings the 70s he's going strong
17:52 in all these arteries he is generating a
17:54 piece of art a week I I think it was
17:59 trying to think what the exact size of
18:01 his normal renderings are but they're
18:03 they're about foot and a half by two
18:07 feet kind of renderings I think he was
18:10 doing four of these a month crazy
18:16 getting paid large in the 70s there was
18:19 a bit of a shift and then he got some
18:20 special projects where he was actually
18:22 brought on board to design luxury jets
18:26 for sheiks which were actually built
18:29 which was really cool so we're talking
18:31 about jets that if you were inside them
18:33 while they're flying you really wouldn't
18:36 know you're in a point Sid was brilliant
18:39 in that he looked at the fuselage and he
18:41 said look we want to destroy the
18:44 illusion that you're inside of a plane
18:45 so what we want to do is make sure that
18:49 through the angling of metal that we get
18:54 rid of anything that really feels like a
18:55 cylindrical tube and he did they even
18:58 put an elevator in this thing I believe
19:01 the number of dollars spent on one of
19:05 these planes was 450 million dollars
19:07 which includes the plane as well but the
19:09 retrofit was extremely expensive but
19:11 you're talking about full bedrooms
19:13 you know hallways to feel normal like
19:15 you're in a house it's pretty pretty
19:18 badass right he designed luxury yachts
19:23 he designed cruise liners Sid also has
19:28 had these moments where he's contributed
19:30 industrial design that was adopted but
19:34 not necessarily the project was created
19:36 so you have an example one of the ocean
19:39 liners that he participated in at the
19:41 time he was drawing ocean liners one of
19:44 the things that occurred was the
19:46 lifeboats are always put out to the edge
19:49 of the boat so you would walk by with
19:51 your loved one at the banister and
19:54 you're trying to look down and you're
19:55 looking right at a boat because that's
19:57 just where they put them and so Sid was
20:01 like that's ugly I don't want to sit
20:02 with my loved one looking at a boat
20:04 trying to look at the water right so we
20:07 get this idea this is where Sid just
20:08 takes it and owns it this is what we
20:10 have to do with our own brains and this
20:11 we have to do with our lives
20:12 he took the boats and hung them over the
20:16 walkway so as you're walking looking out
20:18 over the banister you don't realize but
20:20 the boats are against the ceiling tucked
20:23 away in these robotic arms they come out
20:26 and drop them down they just swing out
20:29 and drop it's brilliant
20:30 so Sid is aware of the entire experience
20:33 when he's designing and again we're
20:35 going it back to what he designs and how
20:37 he designs just a second year now Star
20:40 Trek the motion pictures the first time
20:42 he ever was brought into design and the
20:45 back story is is that the original group
20:47 was fired from the project so they were
20:51 just unable to you know move quick
20:55 enough reduce the risk what have you and
20:58 so Sid was brought in to design feature
21:00 again Sid didn't write the script and if
21:03 you actually watch the film there's a
21:04 little bit of criticism on it but it's
21:05 actually a pretty damn cool story I've
21:08 talked about it quite a quite a few
21:09 times but Vijay was just this amazing
21:12 organic thing they actually built a set
21:14 I think that was like 35 feet long that
21:16 they just pushed a camera through the
21:18 whole time or even bigger but that got
21:22 him into film and then a miraculous
21:25 thing occurs in 1980 to 1981 Sid gets
21:29 greenlit on two different cult classic
21:33 franchises in one year
21:37 this is just utterly phenomenal and then
21:40 he continues he continues getting in
21:42 Nicole classics but the first two he
21:46 gets greenlit on is tron which he series
21:49 with the French artist named Mobius who
21:52 just passed away 2009 unfortunately and
21:57 then he gets greenlit on Blade Runner
21:59 and this is where I'm gonna segue into
22:03 the way that Syd designs there's two
22:08 different things that Syd does that I
22:09 think initially that you should be aware
22:11 of that is sort of the the calling card
22:14 of how this guy does his magic the one
22:17 thing said religiously does on his own
22:20 is scenario so scenario means if he is
22:26 hired to design a car for instance this
22:28 is what happened with Blade Runner he
22:30 was hard to do cars because he was
22:32 famous for that he puts the car into a
22:35 world that the car looks proper so you
22:38 understand why the car looks the way it
22:40 looks so if it's a dirty kind of gross
22:43 futuristic car he just draws this on a
22:47 white piece of paper you may or may not
22:49 know why it's struggling to look pretty
22:52 and so what he does is he will just
22:55 write a story around it and so what he
22:57 ended up doing was looking at the script
22:58 and saying it's sort of this you know
23:02 kind of derelict version of LA from 2019
23:07 everything's upside-down
23:08 and so he just looked up he was pretty
23:12 familiar with San Francisco to begin
23:13 with but then he looks up pictures and
23:15 he starts just drawing or painting
23:16 excuse me these scenarios to put all
23:19 these cars in Deckard's cop car the
23:22 spinner jf Sebastian's armadillo car
23:27 that shows up a bunch of alert other
23:29 little ancillary cars that he designed a
23:31 Jean Winnefeld built and the story goes
23:34 is that CID starts turning in this
23:36 artwork to Ridley Scott and really
23:38 Scott's looking at going knowing that
23:40 he's really supposed to be just looking
23:41 at car design and he says well who told
23:44 you what the world looked like
23:46 and Syd just goes nobody I read the
23:48 script make complete sense to me so I
23:50 started designing these worlds around my
23:52 car so they would look you know better I
23:54 do scenario and Ridley was so blown away
23:57 he goes fine just keep designing can you
23:59 do interiors as well sits like [ __ ] and
24:03 so he ends up doing Jo Sebastian's
24:06 interior in fact if you see the original
24:09 renderings of Sebastian's interior it's
24:13 utterly phenomena I'll put him in the
24:14 episode for you they're all on the
24:16 website Sydney calm which yours truly
24:19 puts together for you he did Deckard's
24:22 apartment in several different angles
24:23 Deckard's apartment Deckard's bathroom
24:25 Deckard's hallways he designed the
24:28 tyrell corporation-- the big giant multi
24:30 mile high skyscraper thing looks like a
24:32 pyramid with a SCAP stone missing he
24:36 also likes to build things that are sort
24:41 of architectural accomplishments without
24:44 the public sort of understanding about
24:46 architects look out and go oh my God
24:48 look at that we can't do that but that's
24:50 cool I guess you could in the future
24:51 right so in 1982 in this movie releases
24:54 in December you have the one of the
24:57 Tyrell corporation things side buildings
25:00 is you have the skyscraper pretty much
25:03 at like a 20 degree angle or something
25:05 but it's massive and today we don't know
25:08 how to hold up a building that is nearly
25:11 a mile high that's leaning at a 20
25:13 degree angle but it looked cool and so
25:17 we did it and because this world is
25:19 serious and actors are being serious and
25:21 so on and so forth you know it's not a
25:25 joke it's a sort of a piece of
25:29 architectural inspiration and
25:31 engineering inspiration guys let's
25:34 figure out how to do this
25:35 wouldn't it be cool the other thing Sid
25:37 does before I move on to Tron is that he
25:40 is a master at using primitive shapes
25:43 but those of you don't know what that is
25:45 and for those of you in 3d you
25:46 immediately know what I'm talking about
25:48 Sid will use shapes that are sort of
25:50 your basic cone sphere cube shapes and
25:55 what he does is he will take basic
25:58 shapes
25:59 and sort of mix them together so that
26:02 may be a sphere we'll cut out of another
26:06 severe its shape it's like a negative
26:09 imprint inside of a different shape and
26:12 the best place to see the masterful work
26:17 that Sid does in primitive shapes is in
26:20 the movie Tron now I've talked about
26:22 Tron a little bit I could probably do a
26:24 whole episode on it
26:26 Tron comes out in August of 1982 same
26:31 development cycle because SIDS in and
26:33 out fairly quickly right the Tron comes
26:36 out and you have again two master
26:38 artists Mobius who put together
26:40 heavy metal The Magazine in heavy metal
26:42 the movie he worked on doomed from the
26:45 70s it was never made but just
26:48 brilliantly shaped Hollywood for
26:50 probably 20 years everyone stole his
26:52 imagery Mobius that is but when I saw
26:57 Tron and I think 11 years old it was
26:59 just prior to my birthday turning 12
27:02 I could see not [ __ ] I busted Ben 12
27:04 yeah I turned 13 later that year I sat
27:07 on the edge of my seat in real life
27:10 later I heard that you know when you
27:12 really want to write gripping moments
27:15 and scripts you have the audience on the
27:16 edge of their seat and I'm telling you I
27:18 was on the literal edge of my seat I saw
27:21 it two days in a row it was something
27:23 completely different it was something
27:25 completely gorgeous the storyline was
27:27 easy for me to understand as a
27:29 twelve-year-old
27:30 and yet it was rewarding up until today
27:33 it's brilliant film writing right but
27:37 inside the vehicle the vehicles
27:40 themselves in the inside these vehicles
27:41 and some of these locations brilliantly
27:45 show Syd's capabilities one of the first
27:49 things you see in the film was the tank
27:51 and you see a recognizers chasing a tank
27:54 and recognizers are these programs that
27:56 try to look for things that aren't
27:57 supposed to be there little recognizing
27:58 programs that are unauthorized but the
28:01 tank exterior was beautiful and smooth
28:03 and amazing had it own style to itself
28:06 and then inside the tank was one of the
28:10 most complex yet simple and beautiful
28:13 interior you'll ever see and the
28:16 interior had its own swivel point its
28:19 own three-dimensional swivel point
28:20 internally it rotated the the tank
28:24 operator at the same time it was driving
28:27 so you could actually fix yourself
28:28 inside and not have to be shaken up and
28:31 any gyro level I mean the SIDS brain was
28:35 just on fire but if you look inside the
28:38 inside of this tank it is built out of
28:40 the most primitive shapes you could have
28:42 picked out of a box of shapes but to add
28:46 more finesse to it okay Sid also design
28:48 all this crazy D caling all this texture
28:52 on top of these shapes that look too
28:54 computer esque but then not you know
28:57 you're you would think that if you
28:59 really did get teleported down into a
29:01 computer and there's people living there
29:02 and they call themselves programs it's
29:04 gonna be a little bit different and SIDS
29:05 differential between reality and fantasy
29:09 was utterly priceless ly perfect I mean
29:13 it really was a perfect example of how
29:16 this works similar to what he did with
29:18 Blade Runner right the light cycle one
29:21 of the most famous things to have ever
29:23 been created back in 1982 which spawns
29:27 so many video games it's ridiculous even
29:29 folks who never paid for the franchise
29:31 Syd's initial design was what actually
29:34 ended up happening in legacy he wanted
29:37 the writer to grab onto the bike and
29:39 fold into the bike his whole body call
29:42 it the lobster suit where you just
29:43 basically grab the handles and you
29:44 become part of the bike now that ended
29:45 up becoming what happened in legacy but
29:48 back in Tron 1 it was not possible to do
29:51 this with computer graphics and live
29:53 action so the bike that you see was sort
29:56 of this okay I got to build a
29:58 compartment around the person that about
30:00 and so the the three companies that were
30:03 hard to do the CG did a brilliant job
30:05 and his designs were just utterly
30:07 phenomenal one of the other things that
30:09 Sid did was they one of the programs to
30:13 have circuitry on their body and so Sid
30:17 came up with the circuitry on the
30:19 outside of Mobius a suit mobius did the
30:22 actual physical hockey suit that turned
30:24 into sort of leotards and hockey suits
30:26 which
30:27 silly today but it worked perfect I
30:28 believe Sid was the one that coined the
30:31 three squares with the square underneath
30:33 which is now the symbol for the
30:35 character Tron he did the IO towers he
30:38 did he actually did designs for some of
30:40 the characters which I think were a lot
30:42 more sophisticated it would have taken
30:45 away from him I think perhaps the
30:46 playfulness of Tron which cuz it was in
30:49 the 80s life wasn't so hard all the time
30:51 right so I think their their marriage of
30:55 Mobius keeping this organic beautiful
30:57 nature with SIDS super industrial design
31:00 was absolutely brilliant move ahead a
31:03 couple years you got two more cult
31:05 classics falling right in your lap one's
31:09 slightly more popular than the other but
31:11 one was the movie aliens now with aliens
31:15 you have James Cameron who's an artist
31:17 himself so you have a director that
31:19 could participate in the art and he's
31:21 actually a really good artist he's not
31:23 just an average you know scribbler so a
31:26 lot of the designs and aliens are
31:28 actually James as personal sketches
31:30 turned into reality but two things that
31:32 Sid did for that film or the the actual
31:36 mothership that the Marines are
31:37 traveling in I don't wanna get the name
31:40 of the ship Ron it's got a bizarre name
31:42 it's all on the website we've been able
31:43 to actually dig out a lot of the super
31:45 high-res scans of SIDS artwork and put
31:48 it on the website in the gallery section
31:49 so man if you want to see this stuff
31:51 beautiful we've even had to scale it
31:54 down just would take a million years to
31:55 load in your phone so get up and take a
31:58 look and it's sy d m EAD one of the
32:03 funny things Sid tells and during his
32:04 presentations which I'm very glad
32:06 happened was his father was unaware that
32:08 there were there was a female spelling
32:11 for Sid and there was a male spelling
32:14 for said the male spelling is si D in
32:17 America and the female spelling is sy D
32:19 well his father chose chose the Y
32:21 because it looked cool and I guarantee
32:23 once you see said signature you'll be
32:27 glad he got the Y instead it's really
32:29 cool
32:29 but the other thing he did in aliens was
32:31 the hibernation pods that the Marines
32:34 wake up inside of and you know with with
32:37 these kind of props would I have to make
32:39 sure
32:39 aware of as when an asset is being
32:41 filmed at a very close proximity
32:45 distance from the camera those assets
32:48 are real important they have to read as
32:51 did Disney would say meaning they have
32:52 to translate to what they're supposed to
32:54 be performing as an object as a gun or
32:57 whatever ship or vehicle right and SIDS
33:00 brain you know is just it was so primed
33:03 because think about it
33:04 this guy has been designing cars
33:06 professionally he's been in this fantasy
33:08 world of the US Steel series but he's
33:10 also been in the utilitarian world of
33:12 Phillips where he's been designing
33:14 coffee makers and all kinds of stuff so
33:16 in his brain it's always been a
33:18 functional imperative on top of his
33:20 designs in a lot of cases so cars have
33:23 to be functional TVs and coffee makers
33:26 have to be function on the US Steel
33:27 series he was able to go crazy and I'll
33:30 tell you one thing that is interesting
33:32 Frank Lloyd Wright was a very very old
33:34 man by the time Sid started getting into
33:38 US Steel series in fact I'm not sure he
33:40 was alive at that point but you'll see
33:42 you'll see Frank Lloyd Wright on What's
33:45 My Line on one of the episodes and he is
33:47 truly father time he's really really old
33:51 if you don't know about Frank Lloyd
33:53 Wright intimately what you'll learn
33:55 about him is that he believed that
33:56 architecture and nature should
33:58 seamlessly combine themselves so as
34:00 you're gonna build a house in the forest
34:02 it should be kind of difficult to see
34:04 the house and the forest it should blend
34:06 in the colors the shapes the finishes
34:08 should all use nature if you're gonna
34:10 build a house in the desert well then it
34:12 needs to take advantage of the clay and
34:14 of the cactus and of the mountain sides
34:17 that might be there Sid did several
34:20 renderings for US Steel where he did
34:23 this exact thing if he wasn't creating
34:24 like a floating city in space you know
34:28 where he could control every single you
34:31 know structure structural support or
34:33 whatever he was blending things in with
34:35 nature beautifully and he still does it
34:37 to this day now Sid will do a lot of
34:39 designs for things and films that don't
34:41 get adopted like I said with Tron and
34:43 the movie Blade Runner he actually has a
34:46 different gun for Deckard than the one
34:49 that was used right
34:50 after seeing the whole movie come
34:52 through I think that the gun that they
34:55 gave Deckard might have been more suited
34:58 for that film because they're doing kind
35:00 of a film noir this sort of old
35:02 detective gumshoe film and so the gun
35:05 that they picked was very 30s to kind of
35:08 go with the theme of the movie it was
35:10 still futuristic and SIDS was slightly I
35:14 think maybe too futuristic in that
35:17 particular case so sometimes he wins
35:18 sometimes he doesn't but when you do
35:21 have a film with sit in it it typically
35:23 does really well in the box office right
35:26 Tomorrowland excluded a 2010 Space
35:29 Odyssey which is 2004 you have a very
35:32 interesting thing occur you have a film
35:36 originally made by Stanley Kubrick and
35:40 Stanley had a very brilliant religion
35:45 with his set props which is I want them
35:48 destroyed second I'm done filming with
35:51 him get rid of him and the reason why I
35:53 think he did this was that if you ever
35:55 saw Forbidden Planet which always
35:57 mentioned on this show all the props
35:59 from Forbidden Planet were used over and
36:01 over and over again in B movies they
36:03 were used countless times in the
36:05 Twilight zones they would take the the
36:07 video footage straight out of her bidden
36:09 planet where the the flying saucer is
36:11 flying through space and they'd flip a
36:13 negative upside down so the ships upside
36:15 down just to kind of say well it's not
36:17 that ship but it's still that ship you
36:19 know the the costumes the laser pistols
36:22 they show up all over the place and
36:24 Stanley didn't want that so when Peter
36:27 Hyams was trying to reboot this
36:28 franchise to get to the second book that
36:30 arthur c clarke wrote for the franchise
36:33 they didn't have a model of the odyssey
36:36 anywhere and obviously it's on film but
36:39 Sid had to go into 2001 a Space Odyssey
36:42 and re-render the Odyssey and I think
36:45 they changed the scale quite a bit you
36:47 know Sid's just designing the ship but
36:49 when they actually inserted at one point
36:51 the people in the cockpit of the Odyssey
36:53 I think they got the scale horribly off
36:56 in one of the shots where it just would
36:58 have been a tin can for the for the
37:00 actual occupants
37:01 but what's the script for 2010 the
37:03 Odyssey is out in Jupiter that's where
37:06 it ended in 2001 and they got to start
37:08 from Earth again and get out there and
37:10 so they came up with the story of the
37:12 lien off this big spaceship which is
37:15 going to have Russians and Americans on
37:16 it at the time you know we have all this
37:18 propaganda about how to hate Russians
37:20 Wow
37:21 nothing's changed right and so that's
37:23 part of the tension in the script the
37:25 Hal 9000 was well known for being a
37:29 renegade computer that potentially
37:31 killed the astronauts in 2001 no one
37:33 quite knows and the story they also have
37:36 to have this this rescue was sort of
37:38 like man pod that you get into to go
37:41 from the lean off over to the Odyssey to
37:43 get inside and so SIDS task was creating
37:46 this this lean off he's tasked with
37:50 creating the pod he has to do the
37:54 command center internally and what you
37:58 need to know is that said will I think
38:01 on the particular lean off because it
38:02 was such a it was such an area of
38:05 freeform design like they were like Sid
38:07 do whatever the hell you want that looks
38:08 cool we trust you you did all these
38:10 other films he came up with at least
38:12 three pretty distinctly different
38:14 designs for things one of the assets to
38:17 trek back to Tron for a split second
38:19 that Sid did and I can't find a
38:21 photograph of this I have to figure out
38:23 where I could find this but he did an
38:24 original sketch of the laser or the
38:27 solar sailer excuse me and he was his
38:30 was very elaborate and intense and they
38:33 ended up taking mobius his version
38:35 because it was very simple like a
38:36 butterfly but so Sid you know he'll
38:38 design things and they don't get picked
38:40 up he just moves on you know he they buy
38:43 it from him they pay for it and they
38:44 just make choices you know so if any of
38:47 you are a little hurt that someone
38:51 didn't pick your design completely and
38:53 that you're your nemesis got it or
38:55 whatever your partner got it yeah you
38:57 know what happens to the best of us so
38:59 Sid did a lot of lot of other projects
39:01 the the other one that's really
39:03 monumental for me personally is
39:06 short-circuit some of you may have seen
39:08 this movie some of you were younger have
39:10 not seen it if you've ever seen wall-e
39:13 you have
39:15 those artists who design wall-e creating
39:17 a miniature version of the short circuit
39:20 robot now short circuit came on out of
39:24 thin air it was like a beautiful spec
39:26 script that Hollywood would never have
39:28 incubated by itself and someone wrote it
39:30 and it's about a robot that was sort of
39:34 the state of the art AI battle bot and
39:38 it ends up thinking for itself
39:40 you've seen this ripped off recently
39:41 with chappie much more intense way
39:47 Syd's work with Neill Blomkamp several
39:49 times so they're good friends but short
39:53 circuit was the first time that we
39:55 really had a robot that had been
39:58 beautifully anthropomorphised using
40:00 real-life mechanical equipment the
40:03 sensors that were the eyes the cameras
40:05 that were the eyes the belts that became
40:07 the feet and the body and the
40:10 articulation and what Syd ended up doing
40:12 that was utterly brilliant is he he one
40:16 of his huge contributions which is what
40:18 wall-e plagiarized almost literally was
40:22 that Syd realized that the eyes are a
40:24 very important part of emotional
40:25 expression so if you're going to have a
40:27 robot with eyes if any of you if any of
40:31 you remember Maximilian from Blade from
40:34 black hole
40:35 I think it's 78 I don't believe said
40:38 anything to do with that but that had
40:40 just a fixed sort of a Cylon looking
40:43 eyeball slot and so it was always
40:46 menacing but that's what that character
40:48 was supposed to be that robot was
40:49 supposed to be scary you know it was
40:52 like oh this is our friend oh yeah it is
40:54 right Robbie the robot never had any
40:57 facial expressions the most he could do
40:58 was kind of troll the stuff in his head
41:00 his voice was the only mechanism he had
41:02 to express himself so Syd looked at this
41:05 history and said look we got to make a
41:07 robot that can actually make your heart
41:09 melt because it's in the script
41:11 and so he used some deflectors like
41:15 almost like horse deflectors I forgot
41:19 what you call those things the blinders
41:20 horse blinders and he made them like
41:24 eyebrows over the top of the character
41:27 so like a Groucho Marx sort of
41:29 thing and so the the character was able
41:31 to kind of tilt his head down and his
41:33 eyebrows would you know hmm you know and
41:35 he had all the emotional expression
41:38 given to the robot team that actually
41:41 built this because there was no CG like
41:42 that back in the day right it was just
41:45 getting started now the whole time that
41:48 sits in the film industry CID will not
41:51 say he's in the film industries like
41:53 that's just an industry he is in the
41:55 film industry but it's not his
41:56 industries like he's not just a designer
41:58 now one of the things that occurred in I
42:01 believe both Blade Runner and Tron I
42:03 don't know if this happened in Star Trek
42:07 is that he invented his own title in
42:10 Hollywood and this is huge
42:12 and he actually got what we call plate
42:14 credits which is his name is up there as
42:17 the designer right next to the director
42:19 which is so huge which is futurists
42:24 designer and what's actually kind of
42:28 interesting about that today is that's
42:29 really SIDS patented copyrighted title
42:33 okay you know you're gonna have people
42:34 get all butthurt about me saying that
42:36 but that's actually the truth you will
42:38 actually have conferences now where it's
42:43 like a futurist designer conference and
42:46 all these other folks that do futurist
42:48 design are coming in with this title but
42:51 SIDS the first one and said invented the
42:53 title now Sid did tons of films after
42:55 this right he the only time Sid's ever
42:58 designed something that I think wasn't
43:03 budgeted properly for its actual
43:05 realization it gets only happened one
43:07 time was I think for the movie future
43:10 comp which if I remember right had
43:13 jean-claude Van Damme where he is
43:17 traveling to the future through this
43:18 sort of triangular port where he zooms
43:22 to the future and does something like
43:23 remember watching the movie being fairly
43:25 entertained but at the end of the film
43:27 he gets in a car and visits this house
43:31 and this car is really designed inside
43:36 of sort of a Blade Runner world and the
43:39 folks that built the car I don't
43:42 had anything to do with it it was all
43:44 budgetarily so constrained that the car
43:46 didn't match the world so he pulled up
43:49 in front of a house that literally I
43:51 could shoot that scene in probably over
43:55 300 houses in my hometown in shinnou
43:57 Kansas okay but this super futuristic
43:59 car pulls up and again I think the
44:01 finish was almost pure white and it just
44:05 was sort of out of its zone had nothing
44:07 to acid' nothing new what the guys that
44:09 built the car I'm sure that they just
44:11 they just ran on money to even put paint
44:13 on the thing right and of course these
44:15 are built on top of chassis zuv other
44:17 cars and that kind of stuff so that's
44:18 the only time his work has ever looked
44:20 kind of funky on camera but that's the
44:23 only time I'm aware of it but he has
44:26 done a Mars movie for because I want to
44:32 say invasion of Mars or Mars invasion
44:34 but it was a John Carpenter film where
44:38 he worked on a bunch of vehicles he has
44:40 done Mission Impossible equipment so
44:43 when Tom Cruise has to have this he has
44:46 a suitcase that builds a prosthetic mass
44:48 they can be pretend to be anybody wants
44:50 to be said comes in and does that on
44:54 Elysium he did the ecto skeleton thing
44:58 you know more recently he has done again
45:02 the Tomorrowland city design so anyone
45:04 who sees the film the film looks
45:06 beautiful in terms of its world I
45:08 haven't seen the film personally but it
45:13 looks gorgeous right he's done Vegas for
45:19 Blade Runner 2049 and so when you watch
45:23 Blade Runner the new one you know
45:25 there's some definitely good points in
45:27 the film that did not use SIDS work but
45:30 obviously it was heavily inspired by Sid
45:32 and but the Vegas thing is really
45:37 brilliant and the director did a really
45:39 cool thing where he actually physically
45:40 built the set and then flew camera
45:42 drones through the set so you could see
45:44 sits designs and the funny thing the
45:47 funny paul harvey about the website too
45:49 is and this is sort of SIDS thing is
45:52 that since a working artist still and so
45:55 when I always came to him and said look
45:57 let's let's get all this stuff up there
45:58 on your website so people could see it
46:00 and I said you know everyone else is
46:01 already scanning your stuff and they're
46:02 stealing all the revenue and all the
46:04 credit and they're selling advertising
46:06 around your stuff he was like well I'm
46:08 not done yet
46:08 you know feels like a greatest hits
46:10 album if we put all my stuff online and
46:12 I'm like so finally I this year I was
46:15 able to pull through and and and put the
46:18 gallery up and make it look beautiful
46:19 and really just get some eclectic stuff
46:23 up there such that you guys can see some
46:24 brilliant designs and high-res there's
46:28 still a lot more I mean he has done so
46:30 many renderings
46:30 he has a gallery that tours the world
46:33 called progressions and again you can
46:35 look on the website to find out where
46:37 it's going to be but it is stunning you
46:40 will go into a gallery okay where you
46:43 were going to see sit originals all
46:47 originals okay like the canvas the board
46:51 that he painted these things on he
46:52 really paints on these boards they just
46:54 do stretch canvas or anything and I'll
46:57 get into some of his techniques here in
46:58 just a second he also has a educational
47:01 series on no mancom which is G in O in G
47:06 G and oh em in this is the place I
47:08 lecture every once in a while so you can
47:11 buy a series of 4 DVDs that teach you
47:14 how he does what he does and he does a
47:16 painting from scratch over 4 DVDs the
47:20 primary content on every DVD is 2 hours
47:23 but there's an extra I believe hour on
47:26 every DVD so in the end you get 12 hours
47:30 of Syd Mead and let me tell you I have
47:32 sat next to this gentleman for again the
47:35 better part of 20 years and I've only
47:37 had maybe I think 2 hours out of 20
47:42 years of tutoring you just have to
47:44 essentially get it when you walk in and
47:46 go ok I see what he did there and see
47:48 what did there and so
47:52 you have an amazing if you're coming in
47:55 as a young artist you have an amazing
47:58 library to examine and what's beautiful
48:00 about Syd Mead is you don't have anyone
48:02 else in the world like him
48:03 you have amazing designers in the world
48:06 absolutely obviously you have silly
48:10 designers too like Jean Winfield said
48:12 you have designers that create things
48:13 that are just ridiculous so I just put a
48:15 pipe there for no reason again you don't
48:18 have to be nonsensical about your design
48:20 you can actually study engineering a
48:22 little bit and get a an amazing design
48:27 because you are designing against an
48:29 objective right if somebody said you
48:32 know hey we got to get the lunar lander
48:34 redesigned to look actually real not
48:36 built out of tent poles you would ask
48:39 the questions okay well what what is an
48:41 environmental system look like today
48:42 what's a booster rocket looked like
48:43 today we can't put the booster rocket
48:44 there because the engine will go up
48:46 through the living compartment that's
48:47 the problem with that design and so you
48:49 would put something together it's a lot
48:50 more realistic if you use the current de
48:55 prop to design the next one then you're
48:58 going to create something silly that
48:59 just simply couldn't exist like that one
49:01 they use but just to review kind of the
49:05 basics that you're going to learn from
49:06 these DVDs and again if you're an artist
49:08 who's interested in industrial design or
49:11 futuristic design for film you haven't
49:15 graduated until you've acquired his
49:18 content now again DVDs aren't really
49:20 popular anymore so nomen has everything
49:22 as a streaming solution just like
49:23 Netflix so you just sign up for their
49:25 service and you get everything stream
49:27 down getting old books is huge
49:30 Syd's books by the way I get asked all
49:32 the time online well do you guys still
49:34 have some of this book and they're
49:35 mentioning a book that was published
49:36 thirty years ago or even older and the
49:39 truth of matter is no a lot of times the
49:42 books because sit isn't in the book
49:44 business he will work with the publisher
49:47 to create a book he provides imagery
49:49 maybe some content a foreword to the
49:51 book says written so many forwards to
49:53 other people's books by the way it's
49:55 countless but they put together the book
49:58 they get it published they make you know
50:00 thousands of them and then they sell
50:03 them so the books the
50:05 you can get from CID directly from the
50:07 website is the century series so century
50:11 2 spelled with an S like the century
50:14 guard I think they have quite a few of
50:16 those left that you can get and again
50:18 CID signs everything so you know you
50:22 want to get a signature from a master
50:24 what you can write the books are made
50:27 out of non aesthetic paper so they will
50:29 literally last forever when I took the
50:31 courses from Edward Tufte the one of the
50:34 information design gods of the world he
50:37 will always show us a book I believe
50:39 that Galileo had published I think it's
50:42 what it is he passes it around the room
50:44 it's a book that's like 300 years old or
50:46 whatever it's like several hundred years
50:48 old and you're holding in your hand that
50:49 looks perfect still and he's like the
50:51 reason why this looks great great and
50:54 the reason why tough these books last
50:56 forever is that he prints on not a city
50:57 paper there was an era in the 20th
51:00 century where books were being printed
51:02 on a city paper and if you've ever taken
51:03 an old paperback book out of your
51:05 grandmother's bookshelf and you open it
51:08 up and all the pages are yellow and
51:09 crusty and they're just falling out of
51:11 the back the glue is crystallized that's
51:14 a city paper that's a crappy book that
51:16 will fall apart and so CID works really
51:19 hard to make sure all of his books hold
51:21 together I will say this much if any of
51:23 his art books fall apart you just take
51:26 every page that falls out and you buy a
51:28 frame and you just put it in there and
51:30 you put it on the wall and you'll have
51:31 one of the best art collections on
51:32 planet Earth we said his design watch
51:35 collections several wardrobe collections
51:38 I got a rain jacket in my house it's got
51:40 says signature all over it's just
51:41 amazing he's done surf a saree snowboard
51:47 designs for Olympic snowboarding people
51:50 you know some he's he's always up to
51:52 something he's on album covers he's just
51:54 he loves people he loves young artists
51:58 he will work with anyone who's
52:00 inspirational he tries to surround
52:02 himself with good wonderful people
52:04 they're very positive about life he
52:07 really wants this place to be a
52:09 wonderful place and before I move on to
52:13 some of his techniques here and his
52:15 methodology or how he paints which is
52:17 going to be very quick
52:19 a couple things about Sid that I think
52:23 have been amazing over the years they
52:25 ask him all the time the question of
52:27 what's your favorite project you've ever
52:28 been on and his answer is always the
52:30 same answer
52:31 and again he loves all the projects
52:33 trust me but Blade Runner is probably
52:36 the most fun I ever had because he was
52:39 invited in to do everything right he
52:42 could design the interiors the exteriors
52:45 the cars again props and so when he saw
52:50 the film I was like wow that's really a
52:51 lot of my thinking in that thing the
52:54 Tyrell corporation which is an icon in
52:56 the movie but he always talks about the
52:58 caveat with that that answer he says
53:00 look however because I got into
53:04 futuristic design because I wanted a
53:05 world to be inspirational remember this
53:09 is a guy grew up in the depression and
53:12 so he was trying to rid himself of that
53:17 right you know one of the reasons why
53:18 Snow White did so well 1936 was the rule
53:22 was in an utter depression spiral and so
53:25 that film was sort of hopeful for the
53:27 public at large and they could just sort
53:30 of disappear into a film it was one of
53:31 the first films with voiceover
53:33 synchronized with the characters in the
53:36 film by the way so when Sid says look
53:40 Blade Runner is probably my favorite
53:42 project by slim margin over the other
53:45 ones it is dark and he goes to kind of
53:48 worry about that I worry about the fact
53:50 that I may have inspired some dystopian
53:51 world and I don't want that to actually
53:54 be the case and so you know pound for
53:56 pound it's probably 99% futuristic
54:00 bright clean world that we all should
54:02 shoot for and Blade Runner is this one
54:05 little drop in the bucket which has now
54:07 been coined as future noir those of you
54:10 who are Blade Runner 1982 fans you owe
54:14 it to yourself to buy a book called
54:16 Blade Runner a future new war which is
54:20 just I forgot the gentleman's name
54:21 mentioned him on episode probably season
54:24 1 but this guy was hired at the very
54:28 beginning of the film to document the
54:30 entire creation of film and if you know
54:32 anything about blade run
54:33 it almost didn't get made three times
54:35 because they lost funding two times and
54:38 at once
54:39 at one point Ridley Scott was fired from
54:41 the film just like you know Steven
54:44 Spielberg was fired from Close
54:45 Encounters but both the guys did the
54:47 same thing and they just came to work
54:48 the next day and kept making their film
54:49 and eventually those that were trying to
54:53 threaten the director learn their lesson
54:54 the hard way right but the other thing
54:57 about said that just is utterly
54:59 fascinating and I'm sure he won't
55:00 mention this at all he has no means of
55:02 mentioning it in his biography so let me
55:04 give you a little biography of my own on
55:06 this gentleman if you watch this show
55:10 you're well aware of my deep exploration
55:14 into everything thinking science blah
55:16 blah technology or whatever and
55:21 theoretical science and existentialism
55:23 and all this really weird stuff that we
55:26 just don't talk about which is why I
55:27 made this show right what's fascinating
55:30 about Sid and the entire time I've known
55:32 him is that I will go and do a mountain
55:36 of research on something and I will have
55:38 had ten years of background before I did
55:40 that research and I'm just met this
55:41 pinnacle Gestalt of stuff that I have
55:44 access to in my brain I helped mentioned
55:47 it to said like well have you ever
55:49 thought about this this and this and
55:50 said I'll just be messing around the
55:52 office I'm moving around the house
55:53 whatever and he'll be like oh yeah you
55:56 know and did you know this this this
55:57 this and this and that and he just
55:59 starts in this fluent conversation where
56:02 I can tell somehow in the midst of all
56:06 this other constant working the guy
56:08 worked and his heyday he was doing like
56:11 12-hour days I think he's finally let
56:13 himself off the hook for that but he
56:14 would need lunch cuz he said lunch made
56:15 him tired and sleepy and so he would
56:19 work these amazing hours will somehow
56:21 between being up 12 hours a day and he
56:25 likes to work at least in the past you
56:27 like to work standing up because he said
56:29 that sitting down would constrain the
56:31 way his body moves and he is aware of
56:33 the geometry of his body and its ability
56:36 or inability to render a shape a line
56:39 you know on a piece of paper and I'll
56:41 get into that just a second but it seems
56:44 as if he is some Gnostic
56:46 where he just sits there in the whole
56:48 universe puts all the information
56:50 through CID well you know you want to
56:52 see the future well here it is woman
56:54 it's almost like every time you see CID
56:55 design you're like I don't know when
56:58 this is going to exist but it will exist
56:59 and it's gonna look just like that
57:01 they're going to build every Syd Mead
57:03 building he's ever design they're gonna
57:05 build every car he's ever design every
57:07 vehicle everything every his clothing on
57:10 his characters are utterly phenomenal
57:12 right
57:13 his nightclubs his homes that are stuck
57:17 in some crazy futuristic world or maybe
57:20 in the I don't know the Andes or some
57:23 polar icecap or something I mean he's
57:25 just done so many things that are so
57:28 phenomenal and I think that if man can
57:30 survive man we're gonna see all these
57:32 things come to fruition
57:34 there's sort of a roundabout way of
57:36 saying Sid's also an academic genius
57:39 absolutely an academic genius as far as
57:43 this technique goes he paints in
57:45 something called gouache which is a very
57:48 elaborate water-based paint it's not
57:52 watercolors like when you were a child
57:54 wash has the same versatility of say
57:57 acrylic and that you could paint a
57:58 canvas black and you could take a white
58:01 paint you know 15 minutes after you
58:03 painted it black it's dry you could dip
58:05 your brush in white and paint a white
58:07 line right down the center of that
58:10 canvas and it'll read perfectly it won't
58:12 blend in with the black it's perfectly
58:14 opaque and it's amazing so gouache I
58:17 don't know when the era of gouache was
58:18 famous what's strange is you don't see
58:20 other people using gouache that much
58:22 like Picasso or or Rembrandt or dolly
58:27 they're painting in oil most the time
58:29 right so Syd's kind of interesting he's
58:32 probably in world history quite
58:35 comfortably the gouache master of the
58:37 universe he really is
58:39 Sid starts off every project by
58:42 sketching sketching concepts and he
58:45 literally sketches you know hundreds and
58:47 hundreds I want to say thousands of
58:49 sketches before he gets to the point
58:50 where he actually sketches in black and
58:52 white what he wants to put on this
58:54 canvas again everything he does if he
58:57 has a choice is in a scenario so one
58:59 point he was
59:00 he was pressed to do a wheel cover or a
59:03 wheel design sorry inside of a tire and
59:05 that's all he was too hard to do so he
59:08 instead of just doing a wheel rendering
59:10 like you see from most artists today on
59:12 the websites he put two cars parked at a
59:18 futuristic party people arriving the
59:20 doors are open there's someone helping
59:23 you know escorting everyone down the
59:24 sidewalk to get to the party and the
59:26 party's kind of going off slightly
59:27 visible in the background if you looked
59:30 at the rendering you'd say well what was
59:31 this for insid just points at the wheel
59:33 and goes that that wheels what I'm
59:35 actually trying to demonstrate all right
59:38 that's the way he works he paints a
59:41 little mini version of his canvas first
59:44 and so he gets all of his colors down
59:46 then he paints the big one he makes us
59:49 all this colors when he's doing the
59:50 little one and then he uses those colors
59:52 when he's doing the big one so he has
59:53 all pre-prepared again methodology is
59:56 everything and simplifying the process
59:58 so that you live purely in the creative
60:00 realm of everything right one of the
60:03 things that Sid does and I've been
60:04 talking about a little bit in recent
60:05 episodes here but I want to make a
60:07 really fine point on this dedicated
60:08 episode to the master is that he
60:13 understands color he understands light
60:17 and he lives in a 3d rendering engine of
60:20 his own for any of you do 3d rendering
60:23 in your professional life you know
60:25 you're modeling something you're
60:26 texturing it you're putting your
60:28 materials on you're lighting it and then
60:30 you're constantly finagling the lights
60:32 to make sure it's got the warmth it
60:34 needs or whatever distinction it needs
60:36 right Sid is his own modeling
60:40 environment he's his own rendering
60:42 engine and you'll you'll maybe look at
60:47 one of his renderings and go well that's
60:48 pretty impressive but there's a lot of
60:49 people who have painted sort of
60:50 photographic level illustrations I would
60:53 beg to differ
60:55 in terms of since quality Sid's like two
60:57 or three orders of magnitude over
60:59 anything I've ever seen anywhere
61:01 including the gentleman Charles I forget
61:05 his last name that did the Star Wars
61:06 stuff that guy was also genius right but
61:09 when you see Sid paint a reflective
61:13 surface
61:14 this is where your mind blows the more
61:16 that you've ever tried to do this in
61:17 your your own life he will you know
61:22 where reflection is one thing if you
61:24 have a because a lot of times artists
61:26 will learn how to paint reflection on
61:28 Chrome or something but they have a
61:29 one-trick pony
61:30 palette that they use not Sid Sid
61:34 controls the time of day to be Magic
61:38 Hour a lot of times but he'll light it
61:40 up in a very clinical environment and
61:42 he'll paint chrome and reflective
61:44 surfaces and using an airbrush using his
61:47 hand he paints with brushes that are so
61:50 unbelievably tiny he's got brushes
61:51 there's just a single hair off the tail
61:53 of like a yak or a llama or something
61:55 right
61:56 and he will paint an image that's
62:00 perhaps again a couple feet by maybe a
62:03 foot and a half sort of canvas type
62:04 that's usually the biggest he gets if
62:06 even that you will paint so detailed
62:09 that when we scan it into a computer and
62:12 blow it up what he has in his home an
62:15 eight-foot wall that is one of the
62:17 renderings he did for Pebble Beach which
62:19 is a car celebration of all car design I
62:24 think for Ford I think if that's right
62:26 has he had a Cadillac in there as well
62:29 MIT was kind of like but anyway he has a
62:30 bunch of cars in this thing when we blew
62:32 it up to 8-foot tall the original being
62:34 18 inches tall you would struggle to
62:39 paint-by-number what you're seeing blown
62:42 up to eight feet because the detail is
62:44 so insane in the original rendering that
62:48 it's just it's breathtaking it's really
62:50 it's you look at it and your brain is
62:53 doing one of those things where you're
62:55 going I can't believe what I'm looking
62:57 at this should be a physical and
63:00 possibility to render this detailed at
63:03 18 inches he did a Mercedes logo in the
63:05 center of this painting which I think
63:07 when zoomed up to eight feet is about a
63:10 six inch logo I don't know what that
63:14 translates to when shrunk back down to
63:16 eighteen inches but it is utterly
63:18 microscopic on this the details you know
63:22 in a Mercedes logo is the three little
63:23 prongs in the center of around
63:27 circle right well each one of those
63:29 prongs has two different dimensions of
63:32 bent steel that come to a point and so
63:36 he is taking into account the reflective
63:39 surface of both of these surfaces in the
63:43 insight each one of the three spokes so
63:44 you have essentially six different
63:47 surfaces inside the logo plus the outer
63:49 circle which is its own two-dimensional
63:52 or three-dimensional to surface sphere
63:55 or circle it's just unbelievable when
63:58 you see the stuff in real life and I am
64:01 so rarely blown away in this world it's
64:04 almost depressing so I wanted one of the
64:07 reasons why I hang out people like Sid
64:08 is that I'm constantly blown away I went
64:11 over to his house and he has a new
64:12 rendering that he's gonna be debuting
64:13 here somewhere he's 84 years old you
64:18 wouldn't know it and he's painted this
64:20 gigantic building it's all I'm gonna say
64:22 but it has big giant flat surfaces on it
64:25 and they are a hundred percent
64:26 reflective and this is setting sort of a
64:29 desert II kind of scene and it's a
64:32 really complex lighting environment on
64:34 this building it's a very beautiful sort
64:38 of again five o'clock hour sort of time
64:40 but each side of the building has its
64:41 limited amount of light because it's a
64:43 cube I mean it's got like a building
64:45 right two buildings or cubes and so the
64:48 reflection off the side of this building
64:49 is just breathtaking just unbelievable
64:53 you're like god I can't do this at 48
64:55 years old and you're doing 84 so one of
64:59 the other things that Sid is that sort
65:00 of inspiration to us locally is that his
65:02 skill set just basically says stop
65:05 making excuses you want to do something
65:08 just do it right yeah it's gonna be hard
65:10 what the hell you know you think that
65:13 great Brendon earrings come out of an
65:15 hour's worth of work again to have Syd
65:18 Mead at his amazing talent work on a
65:21 painting for a week is a tremendous
65:26 amount of concentrated skill inside of a
65:28 rendering because what he could do in an
65:31 hour would blow your mind now to add a
65:34 little bit of lore and and true mythos
65:39 to the sky
65:40 he did two things in front of me that uh
65:43 Turley blew my mind to pieces in and one
65:47 he wasn't trying to do in front of me
65:48 and one he he bumped me and said watch
65:50 this he was drawing a human scent he
65:55 always puts a human next to structure so
65:57 you know how big they are so he defines
65:59 scale right something you learned
66:00 probably an art center but you know we
66:02 have our hands
66:04 I'm just holding up my hand in the video
66:05 here we have these two little bumps at
66:08 our wrist and then you have the five
66:09 fingers with the thumb you know three or
66:11 four fingers and a thumb and then the
66:13 other bump on the other side of the
66:14 wrist and that's sort of you know all
66:16 these little touch points are how
66:17 artists figure out to keep things in
66:19 proportion so most of us would ship a
66:22 little bit of the bump from the wrist we
66:25 kind of start doing the shapes the
66:27 fingers a little bit and then we do the
66:30 other bump on the other side it would
66:31 take several little strokes to pull this
66:32 off probably about ten years ago I was
66:35 sitting there watching him draw and he's
66:38 doing left right bicep left right
66:41 forearm and then he stops right at where
66:45 that little bump is in the wrist and in
66:48 one second probably technically speaking
66:51 a quarter of a second he goes Wham he's
66:54 on the other side of the wrist and in
66:57 that one stroke he is drawn all four
67:00 fingers and a thumb and he's back at the
67:02 other side and it's not some goofy hand
67:05 like most of us would draw or it was
67:07 like just a little bit above stick
67:08 figure and I'm an artist and you know
67:10 that still hands are like if you if
67:12 you're an illustrator hands were
67:13 something you had to get you had to get
67:15 figured out but this is in a really
67:17 beautiful organic shape it's very
67:19 natural hand shape so the guy's got like
67:24 supernatural capabilities all right one
67:27 of the other tricks he said he did in
67:29 school this is where he bumped me one
67:30 day there's like three of us standing at
67:33 his desk and his desk by the way for
67:35 those of you think you need to have a
67:36 bunch of fancy stuff his desk
67:38 since Star Trek is a door it's a flat
67:44 door and so he's got these two sort of
67:46 plywood boxes which I mean they're the
67:49 most crude if you just took plywood and
67:51 I said make you know a 36 36
67:54 inch tall maybe two foot wide bookshelf
67:59 out of plywood just just do it just
68:02 nothing fancy yes that's the two sides
68:04 of his table on top of that I think he
68:06 has a couple blocks that kind of level
68:09 this thing up about another two inches
68:11 some cut two by fours okay and then he's
68:14 got a door on top of that and the door
68:16 is a very flat door right doesn't have
68:17 any of the indentations there's no hole
68:19 for the knob or whatever it's been
68:22 filled in but he then layers that with
68:24 cardboard
68:24 you know sketch board and it's all taped
68:27 down to the board so that's his surface
68:30 by the way he's got two lights clamped
68:32 to it which he recently replaced his
68:35 fluorescent lamps with LED lamps and
68:38 he's very particular about the color
68:39 that's shown on to his surface to make
68:41 sure it doesn't bleed out his paint and
68:44 so doesn't look weird when the paintings
68:46 taken out from special lighting you know
68:48 so he's very meticulous about that so
68:50 this group actually was able to figure
68:51 it out but he bumps me and I'm looking
68:54 to my right Roger was doing something to
68:56 my right and he's like watch this he
68:58 gets a 8 by 10 piece of paper out of the
69:01 printer 8 by 11 or whatever and he draws
69:05 very quickly three boxes three squares
69:08 at different places on the piece of
69:10 paper and it's just all and what he does
69:12 is he goes he does all the vertical
69:13 lines first he goes bump bump bump bump
69:15 bump um then you go swimming print paper
69:17 no straight edge he did this with his
69:18 hand right in front of me and then he
69:22 gives me a ruler and he goes check it
69:26 out and I'm kind of going what and he
69:28 goes check if these are parallel with
69:30 each other and so I put the paper on the
69:33 edge of the table to make sure it's
69:35 lined up but the ruler on the line of
69:37 the edge of the table keeping it aligned
69:38 perpendicular and I'll be god damned if
69:41 all three of these boxes were utterly
69:44 perfectly congruent with each other in
69:46 alignment they were perfectly aligned
69:48 you know they're not aligned vertically
69:50 or horizontally but they're all parallel
69:52 all the lines are parallel and he looks
69:54 at me any kind of smiles and he was I
69:56 used to do it in school all the time too
69:58 it needs to blow away and my teachers
69:59 obviously it is the only time in the
70:03 entire time I've known this man he's
70:06 ever kind of boasted just a little
70:08 tiny bit like a micro boast meanwhile
70:10 he's turning in these godly you know
70:12 renderings of the universe and not
70:13 saying a word the guy is the most humble
70:15 dude on planet Earth
70:17 and Dustin inspiration to any of us who
70:19 think we were we've got the drop on
70:21 something right now Sid I have to just
70:25 throw a chess key out here I'm sure he
70:27 would say that he wouldn't be where he
70:28 is today without his partner Roger
70:30 servic it was an amazing human being
70:32 both these guys are just utterly
70:33 first-class humans just the sweetest
70:36 most generous guys you'll ever meet in
70:38 your life
70:38 so they're a team and they've been
70:41 pulling off magic for decades really
70:44 great so my advice to you is this if
70:47 you're an artist of any kind I think you
70:51 would I mean I guess if you're even
70:53 those cartoons you have a whole series
70:54 of cartoons on the website he's got the
70:56 hundreds of cartoons get onto the
71:00 website take a look at the books you can
71:01 get your hands on because they will
71:03 typically go out of print and then I
71:06 hear your you know email later on what
71:08 kind of please get that book and it's
71:09 like I we don't control that book now
71:11 some of them we do control the
71:12 reprinting of but our philosophy is
71:14 essentially when I create a new one
71:16 instead of an old one right at some
71:19 point I will create a book with Sid that
71:23 will cover a lot of this with my own
71:26 narration in there I think it just needs
71:29 to be told because a lot of times the
71:31 books are just simply exhibition pieces
71:32 which is great but there's a lot more to
71:35 it that has been covered in this
71:36 particular episode and no one's going to
71:38 ever see this in mass so get the books
71:41 you can get definitely grab a copy of
71:44 future remembered part one it goes up to
71:47 I would say a lot of the exciting stuff
71:51 that I've covered in this episode it
71:52 covers there will be a second part to it
71:55 when Sid does presentations to students
71:58 and other companies because he's flown
72:00 around the world to do presentations at
72:02 Apple and Lego and you know every single
72:05 car manufacturer in the planet to
72:07 inspire their designers to go to the
72:08 next level the one thing he does talk
72:11 about is the tech trap and it is the
72:15 trap by which you again you you buy all
72:18 the fancy stuff to be an artist but you
72:21 think that somehow having a better pin
72:23 is gonna somehow guide your hand to draw
72:25 a better picture and in the end you
72:28 really have to study what you study and
72:30 Sid went through all the traditional
72:32 phases of teaching himself the human
72:34 body teaching himself how vehicles are
72:36 put together
72:38 he didn't draw everything from like per
72:40 side perspective elevation drawings he
72:43 drew everything in 3d so that he could
72:45 always understand okay an axial oval
72:46 cars this you know this this distance
72:49 between two axles for this number of
72:51 years and car manufacture and then it
72:52 widened and then it shrunk and so he's
72:54 always paying attention to those things
72:57 the other thing that Sid is starting to
73:00 I guess you could say philosophize
73:03 during presentations today which is
73:06 extremely insightful is that because
73:08 said has been at the forefront of all
73:09 things technology and futuristic his
73:13 perception of where the world is going
73:15 in a very organic sense to say look
73:18 we're all headed like there's a bunch of
73:19 vectors of society right there we're
73:21 headed in this direction at the speed he
73:24 has really profound simple statements
73:28 about where we're going you know at this
73:30 particular phase one of the things he
73:32 told me recently which I'll finish up on
73:34 is I said you know cars in 50 years are
73:37 gonna be very ceremonial you may or may
73:40 not ever own one again because we're
73:42 coming up with all these auto drive cars
73:43 and you know why would you ever buy one
73:47 if you can always get a ride where you
73:49 need to go there goes the fuel problems
73:51 the congestion traffic problems go away
73:53 and your taxes go away on it now he does
73:58 understand intimately believe me he's a
74:00 car buff like he would believe a so is
74:02 Roger the amount of amount of
74:05 information these guys know about cars
74:07 is crazy but they they know that people
74:11 want the stylistic status of owning a
74:14 car now maybe that transfers into a
74:15 different industry where it's your
74:17 clothing or insurer eyewear whatever but
74:20 it maybe you can rent them fancy your
74:22 car who knows I think one of the most
74:24 underutilized areas of SIDS mind is his
74:27 vision on the future because you can't
74:30 get
74:30 a person that has focused more on the
74:34 future than cyd meet you really can't
74:36 you'll have various scientists and in
74:39 very regimented areas of thinking that
74:43 we'll know we're at artificial
74:44 intelligence is going perhaps were the
74:47 motor designs of the world are going the
74:49 conversion of gasoline to energy goes
74:52 but this guy is looking at the entire
74:54 planet because he always has right so we
74:58 have a living legend and 2018 if you can
75:03 get to any of his appearances get to
75:05 them but if you can get a signed book
75:08 all the books are signed either it's
75:11 either the book itself is signed or
75:13 there's an insert let's put in the book
75:16 either way
75:17 believe me it's it's utterly a priceless
75:19 piece of paper once you get it obviously
75:23 because there's so many books inserts
75:24 are becoming very popular with folks
75:26 because you know lining up all getting
75:29 all the books out of storage and lining
75:30 them all up for someone to sign actually
75:32 on the piece of paper in the book is a
75:35 little daunting and again he's a busy
75:37 working man so they they do really
75:40 beautiful inserts from time to time but
75:43 if you catch them out in appearance you
75:44 can bring your books and he'll sign them
75:46 live so I think he's keeping most of his
75:48 appearance in Los Angeles did is his
75:50 work schedule so you know you might have
75:54 to be here locally but if you had to buy
75:55 a ticket to come see him you'll never
75:57 regret it in your entire lifetime one of
76:00 the funny things about said is that when
76:02 he does show up but appearances like
76:04 comic-con or something like that his
76:06 line is around the block for people
76:09 trying to see him and get signatures and
76:11 there'll be a famous famous actor or
76:13 some other famous person sitting in
76:15 booths next to him and they basically
76:18 get the run off and that should tell you
76:20 a little something about the the kind of
76:22 people that recognize his talent and
76:24 again if you're in line the people that
76:26 you'll talk to are going to be some of
76:28 the most talented brilliant people you
76:29 to stand in line with famous people so
76:32 you have a signature from Sydney it's
76:33 interesting right more of a production
76:36 kind of person but it's phenomenal so
76:41 anyway I wanted to share this with you
76:42 guys because it's it
76:44 just one of those things it's very
76:45 invaluable on many levels
76:48 so hopefully enjoyed that if you have
76:52 mid to deep thoughts radio calm please
76:54 go deep thoughts radio.com
76:56 there's audio video locked Facebook
76:58 group and patreon is currently there's a
77:02 store page yeah we'll see if we can't
77:04 come up some more designs I'm just
77:05 struggling for time here if you've never
77:09 seen deep thoughts before the rest of
77:11 show is extremely different than this so
77:13 you this may be the only episode you
77:15 ever need to watch you may not need to
