00:00 [Music]
00:33 good afternoon ladies and gentlemen
00:38 today I am and welcome to deep thoughts
00:42 excuse me today is a little bit windy
00:46 which kind of sucks cuz it wasn't one of
00:48 the earlier today there's obviously no
00:50 clouds in the sky which is great
00:52 I was listening back to the episode that
00:55 I did with my buddy Dave on cigars and
00:58 I'm gonna encourage him to redo that
01:00 with me at a future time because it just
01:04 been a while since I did anything
01:05 interviewee and it was sort of spur of
01:07 the moment
01:08 no not like I did a very good job
01:10 personally like you did a much better
01:14 job at times but what I'm gonna do is
01:18 actually cover cigars where it is
01:21 trivial in a dedicated episode here and
01:25 then we will allow a specialty show to
01:29 kind of go a little bit deeper into
01:31 personal opinions and that sort of thing
01:33 before I get started into the basics of
01:36 cigars just one of the overviews of it
01:39 is that you know you know it depends on
01:43 how you grew up around them I think the
01:46 kids today grow up not around them at
01:48 all but it was still pretty rare for me
01:51 even in the 70s there was a dude who
01:53 work for my grandfather who at one point
01:56 in time owned a dealership where he sold
01:59 dodges he sold
02:01 dodging Chrysler's but he had an
02:06 employee named Perry
02:09 and it's a big black guy and I remember
02:13 just he was just as wise soul man
02:15 he was dressed sort of like the sort
02:19 like a 30s you know where he had sort of
02:21 a nice outfit on all the time with his
02:23 hat on my grandfather dressed the same
02:25 way but he always had a little tiny
02:27 cigar in his mouth like John Belushi and
02:32 I knew nothing about it didn't ask any
02:35 questions about it but the guy always
02:36 smelt like and he always had Chiclets
02:39 gum because before he would step up to a
02:40 client to sell them something he'd chew
02:43 on a few pieces of gum probably freshen
02:46 up his breath so to slip me the Chiclets
02:48 you know which I loved
02:51 seemed like he was 9 feet tall I have no
02:54 idea how big the guy was but he's just a
02:57 big sweet soul so that was my first
03:00 exposure to this and then really the
03:03 second time I ever got exposed to it was
03:05 when I smoked my first one and I was a
03:07 kid it was smoking cigarettes at the
03:09 time about between age of 8 and 11 I
03:12 smoked cigarettes like like a normal
03:14 adult as much as I could get ahold of
03:16 them Lucky Strike and Pall Mall super
03:20 long none filters the very tail and I
03:24 got into Winston filters and that was a
03:27 weird experience which is a very short
03:29 period of time but when I got a hold of
03:32 my first cigar I puffed on it and I
03:35 turned purple probably but all of us
03:37 were taking turns with this cigar don't
03:39 even know who the hell got the damn
03:40 thing but we're inhaling it we're
03:43 getting sick fast because it's
03:45 displacing our blood sugar levels so let
03:48 me dispel a few myths about my approach
03:51 to cigars
03:51 I don't spoke to be macho
03:55 I don't smoke to be a man necessarily I
03:58 don't think I necessarily look cool
04:01 smoking a cigar that's like one of the
04:03 dumbest things you could think there's
04:05 an extremely interesting history behind
04:07 cigars
04:08 obviously the Native Americans and
04:10 people in South America were rumored to
04:15 have been doing this again Native
04:17 Americans for sure further south
04:20 the history it's a little bit sketchy
04:24 when the sellers came over from Europe
04:26 for probably the tenth time they found a
04:28 whole culture here rolling up tobacco
04:29 Leafs and sticking them up their noses
04:33 puffing on them super long sticks and
04:38 I'm sure that they knew back in the day
04:40 that smoking tobacco made you mellow it
04:44 really mellows you out I don't know if
04:47 they inhaled it or not I assume so but I
04:50 know not a single individual that
04:52 inhales cigars I meet guys that seem to
04:56 be full of [ __ ] who said Heil cigars
05:00 meaning they kind of have a bunch of
05:04 other tall tales to tell
05:05 and it's seemingly like they it's really
05:08 funny the guys that say they inhale
05:09 cigars and there are a few you know I
05:11 know a few guys that can do it but
05:13 they're burly
05:16 golems you know but the guys that flip
05:20 into it and say oh yeah of course I do
05:22 or I used to or whatever you know they
05:25 just have a lot of other things that
05:28 they need jerk into which I don't think
05:30 are true and I don't think they have
05:34 done it because they they think they can
05:37 lie about it if you inhaled a cigar you
05:40 would be on your back fast so what's
05:44 interesting about cigars is that for
05:46 those of you who can appreciate a fine
05:48 wine you might look at a cigar if you've
05:51 never been around them or smoked them
05:53 and thank god these are filthy filthy
05:55 things and just think about it it's it's
05:58 20 times more intense than a cigarette
06:00 because I heard that one cigar has as
06:04 much tobacco in it as a whole pack of
06:05 cigarettes and there's 20 cigarettes in
06:07 a pack I used to believe that too
06:12 but there's nothing closer to a fine
06:14 wine in terms of tobacco use than a
06:17 cigar the same exact principles apply to
06:20 a cigar that apply to fine wine each
06:22 year a wine crop or us a grape crop
06:27 grows neither has a good crop or a bad
06:30 crop same thing with tobacco either
06:33 a good year or you get a bad year now
06:36 just like wine they will sell you the
06:38 crappy crop they have no choice but to
06:40 sell it perhaps at a discount with
06:44 tobacco well they may choose to sell off
06:48 a bad batch of Leafs off to another
06:50 reseller who might be able to use that
06:52 flavor profile to build the cigar the
06:54 tastes like what they're famous for but
06:56 a lot of times they'll just go into the
06:59 crappier cigars we're gonna get into all
07:01 this a cigar and a cigarette is almost a
07:06 complete opposite object from each other
07:10 cigarettes are made out of paper that
07:12 has been soaked in a goopy soup of
07:16 tobacco and again as I've always heard
07:20 it described to me by the anti-smoking
07:21 league and you know I couldn't name
07:23 these if I tried and I've never had a
07:26 name to me but when I was a kid and they
07:28 were really against smoking they said
07:30 the cigarettes have had 1,200 to 1,500
07:32 chemicals added to them for preservative
07:35 reasons addiction reasons you know
07:38 sitting on the shelf and not going stale
07:40 all these different things don't know if
07:43 that's true but it's a [ __ ] ton of weird
07:45 stuff when you pick up a cigarette and
07:49 you look at it you look down the barrel
07:51 and you see brown shavings inside that's
07:55 not tobacco I mean you're looking at a
07:58 little bit of tobacco but you're looking
07:59 at sort of a dusty gravy of tobacco on
08:02 top of paper or cardboard there are some
08:08 cigars cigarettes that have the
08:09 literally the paper classification of
08:12 cardboard inside the center now the
08:15 outer is obviously you know nice a
08:17 zigzaggy wraps that makes it nice and
08:20 light and dainty if you have a filter on
08:23 your cigarette then you have something
08:25 tent amount to compressed insulation
08:28 slightly more refined than the stuff
08:30 that's in the roof or the Attic of your
08:32 house but damn near the same a sort of
08:36 fiberglass mesh that is to catch the
08:39 carcinogens and the clouds that go into
08:42 your throat the bad stuff so what they
08:44 teach you
08:46 what ends up happening is that you suck
08:48 all the fibers down not all of them but
08:50 I a trace amount of those fibers down
08:53 into your lungs which essentially cut
08:56 you on a microscopic level and then you
08:59 put the sludge down in your in your
09:01 lungs because you're inhaling the
09:03 cigarette which again you're only
09:05 smoking a tiny percentage of actual
09:08 tobacco
09:09 if you've ever done studies you know for
09:11 fast-food restaurants and how much
09:13 actual beef they have in their food and
09:15 you find out it's like around 11% beef
09:17 and a Taco Bell Taco and the rest is all
09:20 a bunch of weird [ __ ] now that's
09:23 probably how you should view a cigarette
09:25 as well but this cigar right here the
09:29 drew a straight state Herrera esteli
09:31 these are my favorite cigars of all time
09:34 below $15 it's a hundred percent tobacco
09:38 the tobacco has been grown and handled
09:42 and fermented just like wine within
09:45 reason I mean we don't put it inside a
09:48 five gallon jug with a bunch of other
09:50 sugars and stuff but it's laid out it's
09:53 it's wetted down and it's dried and it's
09:57 hung and it's compressed it's picked and
10:00 sorted and it's compressed into big
10:02 giant bales and they wrap it up in these
10:04 bills and then they wash it down with
10:05 all kinds of water and it's one other
10:09 thing I can't remember exactly what it
10:11 is but do all kinds of wild fermentation
10:12 put it inside these these warehouses
10:15 where then it gets you know time to sit
10:18 and they pull it out they create these
10:19 big giant piles and then they rotate the
10:22 piles I mean it is incredible this cigar
10:25 as I am told is that at least 300 people
10:28 touch it and unless the cigar is machine
10:32 made that's true for almost all cigars
10:35 you haven't had 300 people touch of wine
10:40 so tell me which one's more nostalgic
10:42 which one is more of a creation of
10:45 mankind it's sitting right here in my
10:48 hand right
10:52 now cigars are very different from
10:55 various brands and various price
10:57 brackets and various regions of the
10:59 world Cuban cigars are completely and
11:03 utterly different than also other cigars
11:05 on planet Earth which makes it almost
11:08 unfathomably amazing that they are so
11:11 different every other cigar is called a
11:14 new world cigar it's non cubed it's all
11:17 over the place you can get Cameroon
11:20 wrappers made in Africa you can get
11:22 Kennedy kept wrappers made in America
11:25 filler all over the world then we'll get
11:27 to the anatomy here shortly the history
11:30 behind any one blend of cigar unless
11:32 it's some brand new blend can go back a
11:37 couple hundred years so you can see a
11:40 cigar released today
11:42 this is 1926 on it and it's not that the
11:46 cigar was made in 1926 unless you're
11:50 playing about three or four hundred
11:51 dollars for that stick what they've done
11:56 is they've gone back and they read the
11:57 recipe the blend for the 1926 and they
12:02 have real ended it for you so you can
12:03 taste it today now who knows they do
12:06 keep old cigars around forever so you
12:09 could have a blender smoke an old 26
12:11 taste it feel it out use the tobacco
12:14 today to simulate that flavor but it
12:18 would be just like trying to create a
12:19 bouquet from a red you know Cabernet
12:24 Sauvignon it's like a 1913 Cabernet and
12:27 someone has to pop the cork taste it and
12:29 kind of go oh okay that's that vintage
12:31 well case so so-and-so scrap blending
12:33 together with that crop will make this
12:34 taste you know blenders are some of the
12:37 most brilliant or I should say creative
12:41 and talented people that can memorize
12:44 things and figure out how things combine
12:46 they do alchemy in their brain right
12:49 let's get into how a cigar is created in
12:53 terms of after all of the steps of
12:57 fermenting the tobacco the tobacco is
13:01 divided up into several different groups
13:04 for its shade it's called
13:05 which it's going to become a rapper on
13:07 the outside on the inside it is
13:10 deveined you know you see a leaf it's
13:13 kind of sort of a thread that goes down
13:15 the center typically the vein has been
13:17 pulled out it gains any level of you
13:20 know notoriety in the leaf where it's
13:23 going to disrupt the rolling process but
13:26 a blender will take all kinds of
13:28 different crops from the from the
13:30 manufacturer or the grower that they
13:32 have access to and so imagine someone
13:35 says well we have eight different blends
13:37 coming in from the fields this year -
13:39 the wrapper which is grown completely
13:42 separate and so the blender will sit
13:45 there and decide the proportions just
13:47 like mixing a drink as much this you
13:50 know this much of this leaf this much of
13:52 that leaf one might be a very sharp
13:55 tasting leaf and so that's put in there
13:56 sparingly where others have a very heavy
13:59 good foundational tobacco flavor but
14:03 they have so many different flavors it's
14:05 ridiculous you know they've got sort of
14:08 your beanie vanilla your beanie coffee
14:09 they have leather flavors and wood
14:12 flavors and hay flavours straight-up
14:15 tobacco flavors
14:16 tari tobacco light tobacco it's it's
14:20 really I can't say limitless but it's
14:23 it'll keep you busy for several years if
14:26 you're trying to learn the profile of a
14:27 bunch of different cigars
14:29 once the blender figures out the
14:31 proportions they teach all the rollers
14:33 what proportions they need to use to
14:36 create the cigar of that year of that
14:39 particular vintage they're usually in a
14:41 warehouse they said at little tables
14:43 surrounded by tobacco leaf bundles and
14:47 bundles of different flavors right
14:49 usually it isn't one all all one flavor
14:51 but sometimes those sticks exist to
14:54 again most the time when the leaf gets
14:56 to the roller it's been deveined and
14:58 it's ready to rock and roll sometimes
14:59 they've got it you know do a little bit
15:01 of clean-up on the leaf to make sure
15:02 that it's going to roll up beautifully
15:04 the deveining of the leaf is really
15:06 important because it controls the
15:10 Oh of air through the cigar which we'll
15:13 get to you after we talk about how its
15:15 put together but imagine a stick inside
15:19 a cigar put up your mouth you pull on it
15:22 and you don't get any air through it and
15:24 that's this huge bummer because you buy
15:28 these things at the store you pay your
15:29 money you leave you drive home and even
15:31 if you figure out you know it's got a
15:33 block in it you may have a store that
15:35 sympathetic to a block and you may not
15:38 but regardless you've driven home and so
15:41 unless it's easy to get back there you
15:42 won't have a good experience so after
15:45 all the Leafs internally are prepared
15:49 cleaned up you're never gonna see it
15:51 you're gonna burn it you're gonna taste
15:52 it the roller rolls up the first bundle
15:57 of leaves so it'll be the center core
15:59 the filler and then you have to hold it
16:04 into that shape right whatever gauge
16:06 you're gonna do now the ring gauge of a
16:09 cigar is essentially like the ring gauge
16:11 you might have if you were to buy a ring
16:14 like this was your finger and so we
16:17 measure I believe in circumference of
16:19 millimeters so for instance a
16:23 ridiculously large gauge would be 60 H a
16:26 normal gauge might be anywhere from a 48
16:29 to 52 gauge the 58 starts getting really
16:32 intense the thicker the gauge of cigar
16:36 really doesn't mean a hell of a lot
16:37 you'll pay more money for it because
16:39 you're actually packing a lot more
16:41 tobacco inside the cigar but just
16:44 remember this ash is going to burn the
16:46 same exact speed it would burn
16:47 regardless of how thick your cigar is
16:50 and so some tobacco burns slow some
16:54 tobacco burns fast right so as I had it
16:59 communicated to me the binder which you
17:01 do not see the binder is underneath this
17:03 this outer coating which is we call the
17:05 wrapper it's usually a fairly Hardy leaf
17:08 that is part of the filler and it holds
17:12 the cigar into shape and so what happens
17:14 is I got these Leafs all cranked up in
17:17 the centre and they have to do it very
17:19 carefully not to create blockage and not
17:22 to create a tunnel
17:23 where you know if you were to look down
17:26 the center of a paper towel well you got
17:28 a bunch of stuff wrapped around the
17:29 outside but there's the hole down the
17:31 middle that we used to hold up the paper
17:33 towels well sometimes that can naturally
17:34 happen anytime you take something like a
17:36 leaf and roll it up if you get a hole
17:39 down the center
17:40 they call that a tunnel and that will
17:43 allow tremendous amount of oxygen to go
17:45 down the center of the cigar which will
17:47 utterly and completely destroy the
17:49 smoking experience because it'll burn
17:51 down the center faster than it burns on
17:53 the outside which means your stick can
17:55 be way down before you are done with it
17:58 they can burn literally in a few minutes
18:00 as opposed to a couple hours right so
18:03 once they get that core blend worked out
18:06 they put the wrapper down they roll the
18:08 whole thing inside the wrapper and
18:11 they've got this little mold that they
18:13 can actually push it into now not
18:14 everyone uses the mold but most of them
18:16 do where they push it into the mold
18:17 which has the ring gauge and reinforced
18:19 we are rolling a fifty-four gauge cigar
18:23 today is what they might say and so
18:24 you've got to get it to be this exact
18:26 diameter and you also have to have at
18:29 this exact length because they're
18:30 rolling a particular size once they have
18:35 it all together
18:36 I think they let it sit for a little
18:37 while they roll a bunch of them without
18:39 wrappers this is just a single person
18:42 wrapping and then I the way I've seen
18:44 I've seen it done several different ways
18:45 but the wrapper leaf is extremely
18:48 special it is grown outside of usually
18:51 direct sunlight there are a couple
18:53 exceptions in the world but usually it's
18:56 just a very delicate leaf it gets a
18:58 little bit bigger and it is the most
19:03 expensive leaf that they make because of
19:05 cosmetic reasons not usually due to
19:07 taste reasons there's this big debate
19:09 down going on as to whether or not
19:10 wrappers taste at all because there's
19:14 there are certain manufacturers that
19:16 think that wrappers have no taste at all
19:17 and it would seem that a wrapper
19:20 wouldn't be able to influence the taste
19:23 of a cigar too much because it's so
19:25 small such a small portion of the actual
19:28 tobacco because the inner core and the
19:31 and the binder are all made of the same
19:33 thing you're talking about at 98% flavor
19:36 profile
19:37 for the binder and the and the filler
19:39 and then just this tiny 2% that goes
19:42 around the outside but again it's chosen
19:46 because it is absolutely beautiful it
19:49 goes around the outside and then you
19:52 have a cigar with two openings before
19:54 you close it off and so one in gets
19:57 arbitrarily picked to be the open and
19:58 there's this guillotine thing that you
20:00 use to cut it down make it perfect but
20:03 then the backside is where the last part
20:06 of the training is for a cigar roller
20:08 which is to put the caps on the end and
20:11 caps are just little tiny circular
20:13 pieces of tobacco and it is it is really
20:16 the most fascinating thing because they
20:18 can roll a cigar extremely fast you know
20:20 just like anyone in a human an assembly
20:22 line learns all the tricks of the trade
20:24 when it comes to these wrappers you see
20:26 them slow down and just put this thing
20:28 on there and they're still very quick I
20:30 mean it would take us probably you know
20:32 10 minutes having never done it before
20:33 but these pros get in there and boy they
20:36 just tap tap tap tap and it's pretty
20:37 amazing but there are cigar brands that
20:41 put a single cap on there and they're
20:44 usually so small you can barely see them
20:45 this and has a triple cap and they you
20:47 just look at it and you just see I can
20:50 see three you know circles around the
20:53 end of this cigar which means it's a
20:54 triple cap and then they put it back in
21:00 the mold push it down
21:01 guillotine off the top make sure it's
21:03 good the there's people down the
21:06 assembly line which will check the color
21:07 of the cigar wrapper
21:10 now there's Herrera studies that are of
21:13 all different shapes and sorry she
21:16 didn't say shapes with shades excuse me
21:19 and what they try to do is when you buy
21:21 a box they don't want you to get a bunch
21:23 of mixed shades so you're worried about
21:25 you know the integrity of your cigars so
21:27 they tend to just pick them all out in
21:28 different shades and they'll put like a
21:30 darker group of cigars in one box
21:33 slightly lighter in another box but that
21:35 just keeps the the a congruent thought
21:40 when you open up the box that you didn't
21:41 get a bunch of weird random flavors but
21:44 again I don't think the wrapper
21:45 influences the taste as much as I
21:47 previously thought it obviously it comes
21:50 with a band
21:51 and that's what we call the wrapper on
21:53 the outside of the wrapper the bands are
21:56 obviously you know first and foremost
21:58 just to identify where you got the cigar
22:01 maybe some designations of its style its
22:03 name you know whatever they want to put
22:05 on there was a bunch of rumors carried
22:10 forward from the days of all that you
22:12 know rap that the bands were actually
22:13 designed to keep your the oils from your
22:16 finger touching the cigar in a way that
22:19 would perhaps affect its burn I don't
22:22 think that's the slightest bit true
22:26 unless of course we didn't bathe back in
22:28 the day and so you needed something to
22:30 keep the oil of your fingers off of the
22:31 cigar but cigars are based on two things
22:37 tobacco and fire and your oils from your
22:41 hands aren't gonna stop fire from
22:44 burning a cigar right unless you're just
22:46 dripping wet so just to review the blend
22:50 is where you have the filler it is the
22:53 core flavor of the cigar one of those
22:55 leaves is typically elected to be the
22:57 binder which is the thing underneath
22:59 this wrapper that you can see that holds
23:01 it together and the wrapper is merely a
23:04 cosmetic leaf on the outside to give it
23:06 its beauty and then the caps go on the
23:09 end they're all summated the wrapper and
23:11 you pretty much have a cigar once you
23:14 put a band on the outside now you may
23:16 have heard or you may not have heard
23:18 there's two different types of fillers
23:19 in the world short filler and long
23:23 filler it is as simple as what it sounds
23:27 like
23:27 the filler that is long filler is
23:29 usually a big long leaf a short filler
23:33 is usually the scraps that come off of
23:36 the big leaves as they're cutting them
23:38 up to make a perfect cigar and I don't
23:41 have really any knowledge about why they
23:44 make the certain cuts that they do they
23:45 have this beautiful circular knife which
23:48 I don't even know what you would say
23:50 besides it almost looks like a dish
23:52 that's been turned into a knife but
23:55 they're always trimming off a little bit
23:56 here a little bit there now the
23:58 difference between a short filler a long
24:00 filler is that in short filler
24:03 it could be little tiny chopped up
24:05 pieces and I mean just the size of a
24:07 postage stamp it could be 2 or 3 inches
24:11 but because there's more space in there
24:14 due to the fact that there's shreds of
24:17 tobacco it burns faster and so a short
24:21 filler burns faster it has a shorter
24:25 lifespan coincidentally all right but
24:29 what I want you to understand is that
24:30 the size of a cigar has very little to
24:34 do with how long it's gonna last when
24:36 you smoke it I can smoke a normal row
24:39 busto which is sort of a typical sized
24:41 cigar for two hours easy sometimes if
24:45 it's a Cohiba cuban cigar
24:48 I can locust I could mocha I can smoke a
24:52 cigar that's the size of this which i
24:55 think is a Toro and it'll last 45
24:59 minutes because it's all short filler
25:02 the experience between a long filler and
25:05 a short filler is typically pretty
25:07 obvious in that the higher quality
25:09 experience will be in the long filler
25:11 and you know that sounds may be
25:13 illogical because hey tobacco's tobacco
25:16 even if it burned a little quickly or
25:19 quicker what would be the problem with
25:22 the actual taste of the experience and
25:26 I'm going to tell you that the the way
25:29 that we smoke cigars and the way that we
25:32 nurture them through the burning process
25:34 affects greatly I think the flavor
25:37 profile on your tongue because you're
25:40 getting things burned into your mouth
25:41 either slow or fast you know there's all
25:46 kinds of foods that you eat if you eat
25:48 them really quickly it almost tastes
25:49 different you know it was like if you if
25:52 you smell a skunk and who's down the
25:54 street it stinks to high heaven but if
25:57 you get one who crawls under your house
25:58 it almost smells sweet as it's giving
26:00 you a massive headache right now in
26:03 terms of because I'm going to bounce
26:05 around some of the facts here to kind of
26:06 spread this out in terms of smoking a
26:09 cigar to taste it the best description
26:13 I've ever heard
26:15 I think might have been Brian Glenn from
26:18 cigar obsession I'm not quite sure but
26:20 the idea was to you're gonna pull on the
26:24 cigar and pull just means suck on it
26:26 right you're pulling air from the front
26:29 to the back the pull is measured in how
26:33 much effort does it take to pull air
26:36 through a cigar if you are pulling
26:38 really really hard to get anything to
26:40 come through your cigar then you might
26:41 have a block cigar and what you'll find
26:45 with the block cigar that's it's still
26:47 kind of functional is that you will bust
26:50 a lot of capillaries in your mouth like
26:52 you'll feel that tingly sensation like
26:55 you've been popped in the face or
26:57 something and you kind of taste
26:59 irony blood because you've been pulling
27:01 so hard on your on your cheek bones I
27:03 mean on your cheek flesh that it's a
27:06 little bit weird now that's a pretty
27:07 rare occasion last time I had this was a
27:09 Vegas cigar and it was just utterly
27:12 painful it's like smoking a really thick
27:15 sponge typically the pull that you want
27:18 is a pretty effortless pull now again if
27:21 you pull on it it almost feels like
27:23 you're just buck sucking on a straw then
27:25 someone probably rolled a tunnel down
27:27 the center of your cigar and you're
27:28 gonna have a bad smoke no matter how you
27:31 adjust it but a block like I said is a
27:35 couple different things that usually
27:36 happens most the time it's a stem that
27:40 didn't get pulled out of the leaf before
27:42 it was rolled into filler if you get a
27:45 stem you can do a few things or the
27:49 other I should say the other way it gets
27:51 blocked is that they simply crimp the
27:53 leaf so tight someone creates so like a
27:55 knot you know you take a chamois and
27:56 you're really twisted it's really hard
27:58 well they can do that to a leaf and you
28:00 can get through it you can't get any air
28:01 past that little twist that is in my
28:05 opinion sort of the worst block because
28:08 without a tool to cut through it to open
28:12 that back up you're gonna have an issue
28:15 and there's a tool called the perfect
28:16 draw which you can find online and it's
28:19 essentially a metal wire as I metal rod
28:23 about six inches long and it has some
28:25 teeth on the end very intense teeth that
28:29 you can push it in but it's barbed to go
28:31 not to go back the other way and so when
28:35 you want to unblock your stick you push
28:38 in the stick and you got to keep
28:39 rotating it so you can keep it centered
28:41 down the center because otherwise you
28:43 can come out the side of your cigar and
28:44 you've completely destroyed it until you
28:47 can maybe use perfect repair which is
28:50 the bottle of the glue that they used to
28:52 put the caps on which is a vegetable oil
28:54 it's adhesive and you can kind of make
28:57 it go down but at that point and you
28:58 really have gelled up the interior of
29:00 the cigar but what you can do is you can
29:03 feel the cigar and you can feel a hard
29:07 spot typically where that stick is where
29:09 that twist is and at that point again if
29:13 it's close to the band close to your
29:15 mouth you can push a perfect draw in
29:18 there and you push it in straight and
29:21 then you rip it out and it Yanks a bunch
29:23 of the tobacco out on the barbs and that
29:25 typically will grab either the vein or
29:29 it will break the vein in such a way you
29:30 can get air through if it's a twist
29:33 it'll typically just pull out a whole
29:34 lot of tobacco and that'll get you back
29:38 on on your feet if that does not work
29:41 we're gonna show you my guillotine here
29:47 my dad got me this is a guillotine
29:50 cutter it works just like the old French
29:53 guillotine and you just put your cigar
29:56 in there and you cut it down the other
29:58 one is a punch which is what I use today
30:00 you can get him on your on your key
30:02 chains and what I did was I created a
30:04 hole right down the center of the cigar
30:07 a punch is you just push it into a
30:09 little cookie cutter exactly like a
30:11 cookie cutter but it's about a quarter
30:12 inch circle you push it in you turn it
30:15 you pull it out and there's a little bit
30:18 of the tobacco missing which opens it up
30:20 with a guillotine when you're opening it
30:23 and we'll get to unblocking here in a
30:24 second the key is this because nobody
30:27 taught me this and this will really help
30:29 you out regardless if you have one two
30:31 or three caps the only cap you need to
30:33 take off to get smoking is the last cap
30:36 so when you have a guillotine cutter you
30:39 open it up you put the cigar in there
30:41 and you just put enough in
30:43 that the first cap is gonna get nipped
30:46 off even if your cutter isn't sharp
30:49 enough and you kind of just graze it and
30:51 the cap comes off and it doesn't look
30:53 that pretty pull on it
30:55 you'll find out it's wide open and
30:56 you're ready to ready to go the ends of
30:58 cigars don't have to be pretty the ones
31:00 that you're smoking from right now let's
31:03 say that this cigar was blocked right
31:05 from the very beginning I've never had a
31:06 Herrera still they ever be blocked and
31:08 there's nothing you can do you don't own
31:10 a perfect draw or you use the perfect
31:12 draw and nothing worked out the best
31:15 thing you can do to save your money is
31:17 to get a guillotine cutter and you can
31:20 after lighting it you can actually put
31:22 the whole cigar through the guillotine
31:24 like this and you cut the cigar directly
31:27 in half one side is gonna smoke almost
31:30 guarantee you it's gonna smoke perfectly
31:32 for the one that didn't smoke well you
31:36 not only have a half a cigar so you're a
31:37 perfect draw tool will almost go
31:39 completely through that other half is
31:40 you can do that a couple times see if
31:42 you can't free it up if you don't have a
31:44 perfect draw and you don't have anything
31:46 that's kind of pokey that you can put in
31:47 there be careful don't poke yourself you
31:50 can take the guillotine and cut it one
31:53 more time and smoke the other half just
31:56 realize the shoulder our cigar gets the
31:59 hotter it gets because this fire which
32:01 has a little cherry kernel in it is
32:03 going toward your mouth
32:04 closer that gets to your mouth and more
32:07 tobacco you're gonna taste the more heat
32:09 you're gonna have on your tongue and
32:11 you're gonna go from a cold draw on the
32:14 first half of your cigar down to a
32:16 really powerful almost tarnished tobacco
32:21 now lighting a cigar has a religion and
32:28 there's all kinds of religions on how to
32:30 light a cigar but no one told me until
32:33 really late was the Cubans just used big
32:35 lighters they don't give a [ __ ] they
32:38 invented cigars they just click them
32:40 boom boom boom and they just light up
32:43 one side it burns okay no big deal
32:45 I mean I've never seen him correct a
32:47 cigar but we'll get into that one second
32:49 today in America what we do is we use
32:52 these butane lighters that blow out a
32:53 really intense flame or two
32:55 or three flames or even four flames
32:58 because you can't sit around all day
33:02 usually nurturing the end of your cigar
33:05 you want the whole thing to light at
33:06 once and then you can start smoking but
33:11 they figured out very quickly when just
33:13 totally firing at the end of a cigar
33:15 some anomalies happen which are very
33:17 costly half the time if you blast a
33:20 flame right down the center of the cigar
33:23 you will like the center of the cigar
33:24 more than you like the outer edge when
33:26 that occurs you have something called
33:28 tunneling due to fire the cigars roll
33:31 fine but you've started a flame that
33:33 goes right down the center faster than
33:35 the flame that's going on the outside
33:36 and so you can burn up the inside of
33:38 your cigar too quickly so in order to
33:42 avoid this what we want to create is a
33:44 cone that points up we want the outer
33:48 edges to burn first and the sender to
33:50 catch up last
33:51 if you ash you should have a cone if
33:56 you're if you're doing right now I'm
33:58 national well quickly on this one but it
33:59 we're still he's always burned
34:01 beautifully so what a lot of us do is we
34:04 use butane lighters with one flame this
34:08 little teepee lighter I bought from my
34:10 smoke shop even though it looks massive
34:12 it only has one flame out the front what
34:17 you do is you take the cigar and you
34:18 draw a circle like a hula-hoop around
34:21 the outer edge you get the whole outer
34:22 edge of the front of the cigar red what
34:26 you don't want to do is put it directly
34:27 down the barrel of the cigar because
34:30 you're paying for every ounce of this
34:31 tobacco why burn it up too quickly so we
34:34 typically glance it off at an angle so
34:37 we just want to just glance it off and
34:39 you can rotate the cigar most the time
34:41 we rotate the lighter we're going a
34:42 circle if you watch a lot of my old
34:44 shows you'll see me doing this circle
34:45 all the time once you get a ring of fire
34:48 going on there you can pull it up and
34:52 then you might hit it diagonally down
34:54 the middle and you're sucking in air
34:56 which gets the cherry on the very tip
34:58 just barely lit and that way the outer
35:01 ring is going down faster than the inner
35:03 core and you will develop a beautiful
35:06 cherry that will balance itself out and
35:08 you'll get this nugget
35:09 a fire sort of at the at the raiser
35:13 point of the burn
35:14 now the raiser reference is if you take
35:18 a cigar and you turn it you can see that
35:21 the flame is going down the cigar at
35:23 different rates right mine is burning
35:26 just a tad bit wonky if you can see that
35:28 right
35:28 but overall her le Herrera still he
35:30 catches up I'm also smoking on a fairly
35:33 windy day which sucks
35:35 Wendy days suck for a couple reasons
35:37 let's say a bunch of wind is coming out
35:39 my face
35:40 well whatever side of the cigar is is
35:42 facing the wind it's going to get it's
35:45 just like if I blew on a fire you know
35:47 it's hotter so it'll burn down one side
35:49 of your cigar faster than the other
35:50 that's what you when you get canoeing if
35:54 you hold your cigar like this it's
35:56 burned out the top the bottom is
35:58 perfectly fine and you basically are
35:59 making a canoe out of fire the other one
36:02 is called tunneling which I said which
36:03 is burning right down the center the
36:06 other one is is that the smoke coming
36:08 off the end here that's what we call the
36:10 foot smoke it's some of the most
36:12 beautiful smoke you can smell and this
36:13 is where we think that the wrapper has a
36:16 beautiful kind of tone to it a smell to
36:19 it right you want to smell it you're
36:22 paying for right that's why smoke
36:24 lounges are really fun because you're
36:25 inside not only are you smoking your
36:28 stick but a guy can sit right next to
36:29 you and fire up a sixty dollar stick and
36:31 even though you're not tasting it you're
36:34 smelling it you're smelling the
36:36 second-hand smoke from his thing and
36:37 again it's not cigarettes secondhand
36:39 smoke which is full of a bunch of sticky
36:41 horrible [ __ ] right but now I'm gonna
36:47 show you a little bit of an error here
36:49 I'm gonna rotate this and you're gonna
36:51 see about right there in the video if
36:53 you're on audio it's about a and almost
36:56 a quarter inch too high on one side now
36:57 this will actually probably balance out
36:59 but I'm gonna do what's called a
37:00 correction you get up this look out here
37:03 and you just point it I usually do it at
37:06 an angle and I just pop it this things
37:11 having a problem the wind
37:13 and you'll see I've made it black that
37:16 black will then burn off and then my
37:18 next few inhales or my next inhales my
37:20 few next pulls and you ought to see it
37:23 turn gray so now it's a little bit more
37:25 even that's what we call correction if
37:28 this burns perfectly on all sides you
37:30 can rotate it and it just looks
37:31 perfectly level we call that a razor
37:33 sharp burn yes so if you ever hear that
37:36 that's a compliment to the cigar and its
37:38 composition but I digress a little too
37:42 much too quickly there how do you taste
37:44 a cigar well as a couple things if you
37:48 just pull on a cigar and you blow the
37:49 smoke out again you're not inhaling it
37:52 never goes down your throat that's the
37:53 thing you might have a little bit of the
37:56 mist and the smoke that kind of puts a
37:58 resin on the inside of your mouth which
38:00 is very slow and mild and you might
38:02 swallow a little bit of that that's
38:04 going down your digestive system not on
38:06 your lungs right again even if you
38:09 breathe the secondhand smoke from this
38:10 it's just pure tobacco now there's a law
38:13 of particulate that says the human
38:14 beings and all life shouldn't breathe
38:16 anything that they don't use to sustain
38:17 life so there's a bit of a risk that you
38:20 if you were sick or allergic to tobacco
38:22 you could get yourself into a health
38:23 issue but the FDA has gone from saying
38:27 you can smoke six cigars a day as long
38:29 as you don't inhale and you'll be fine
38:31 to six cigars if you do inhale you'll
38:33 have the first entry level amount of
38:36 cancer but they're always changing that
38:38 statistic but how to taste the cigar
38:42 here's what I was talking about before
38:44 before actually saying what it was
38:46 you're gonna pull on this you know a
38:49 cloud of smoke in your mouth and you're
38:52 just going to open your mouth and let it
38:54 flow out of your mouth so check this out
39:06 and then you lick the top of your mouth
39:08 with your tongue and like again the
39:10 flavor on this cigar is utterly
39:12 phenomenal in my opinion for for a $15
39:15 stick it's really like it's probably by
39:17 15 bucks with the new taxes we have here
39:19 in California but you can buy them
39:20 online boxes for a lot cheaper it's a
39:22 Jewish state Herrera Stelly the other
39:25 thing you can do is retro Hill which is
39:28 you can pull it in and then you blow a
39:29 little bit out your nose your nose has a
39:32 whole separate game going on and you can
39:34 get all kinds of wild flavors inside
39:36 your nose that you can't get just purely
39:37 by licking your roof of your mouth with
39:40 your tongue the other thing is the
39:43 cigars have at least three stages of
39:46 taste in most regards and we call those
39:49 the thirds
39:50 so the first third of the cigar has one
39:52 flavor the second third is a different
39:53 flavor and the last third has its last
39:56 flavor part of this sounds like magic
39:58 but when I really thought about it
40:01 over the years it's not magic at all
40:02 it's actually just the standard aging
40:05 process of the cigar when this is done
40:08 being rolled I got one side that's
40:10 capped one side that's wide open and so
40:14 I've got you know regardless of how it's
40:15 stored there's oxygen going in the front
40:18 aging that tobacco differently than the
40:21 stuff in the center which is protective
40:22 from both ends as opposed to one at the
40:25 very end which hasn't had hardly any
40:27 exposure to oxygen the other thing is
40:30 that the flame is going from the front
40:31 of the cigar to the back of the cigar so
40:34 the amount of tobacco that you can
40:37 actually get into your mouth the whole
40:38 cigar is acting like a filter the whole
40:40 time you're smoking so the closer that
40:42 the cherry the fire gets to your mouth
40:44 the less filtering is going on so a lot
40:47 of people who are longtime smokers as
40:51 soon as they have to take the band off
40:52 they smoked about the base of the band
40:55 leaving about an inch and a half and
40:57 they throw it away and there's a reason
41:00 for that
41:01 and typically it's only if you're sort
41:03 of a veteran smoker do you do this
41:05 because when you're beginner you're
41:07 paying 10 bucks for a stick you're gonna
41:09 smoke every damn inch of it right till
41:11 like the points burning your fingers but
41:14 in the first third of the cigar what I
41:17 have noticed unless it's magical
41:19 is that you get sort of a more ashy
41:21 flavor because it's sort of drier at the
41:23 end and that's usually lasted about half
41:25 an inch to an inch tops and then once
41:29 you cross that first inch you start to
41:31 getting getting into tobacco that is
41:33 less dry and it starts having really
41:38 sort of the profile that you're
41:39 expecting if someone said to you s has
41:42 got a really good vanilla bean flavor or
41:44 it's got a leather flavor or whatever
41:46 that's when it starts kicking in for me
41:49 my favorite part of the cigar is the
41:51 center third because it is for me the
41:53 most pristine version of what the roller
41:56 meant to give to me especially if it's
42:00 humidified properly which is usually
42:01 about 69 degrees or sixty sixty-nine
42:04 percent humidified it's usually the
42:08 Golden Rule around the world when hit
42:11 the last third he got the cherry pretty
42:14 close to your mouth and that's when you
42:16 start getting the heavier profile it's
42:20 whatever you were smoking but way more
42:21 intense this is the last third is where
42:24 you start to get that a little bit of a
42:26 loopy head feeling if you're not used to
42:29 smoking cigars or you happen to pick up
42:31 on a really tough cigar having said that
42:35 there are cigars there's a brand out
42:37 there called new world there's a very
42:38 dark Maduro wrapper it's almost like
42:40 blackest night do usually pretty small
42:43 but they will kick your ass and one inch
42:46 I have never been able to get to a
42:48 halfway mark of the New World Madero
42:50 it's just way too much my my buddy sold
42:54 a box of them once and I've never seen
42:56 more almost fully full-length cigars
42:59 sitting in ashtrays sitting outside on
43:01 the ground because everyone was like
43:02 look if you're smoking a cigar and you
43:05 get high here's what you do you eat a
43:08 piece of chocolate you eat some sugar
43:10 you can even take TSP of sugar just a
43:12 teeny tiny bit of sugar put it on your
43:14 tongue
43:14 drink it down with some water you can
43:16 even drink soda well it's bad for your
43:18 teeth and your body and it will reach
43:20 ability to you in about a minute 60
43:22 seconds you will go from needing to hurl
43:25 to being just fine the big advice on the
43:29 street is eat a meal before you smoke a
43:31 cigar I will tell you that
43:33 sweet things that you eat before you
43:36 smoke a cigar will really accent the
43:39 sort of rustic flavors of tobacco if you
43:41 eat a big steak with butter and all that
43:43 good stuff it's almost a complimentary
43:46 thing that you're gonna be smoking a
43:48 cigar if you ever get slightly addicted
43:52 to these it will be because you're
43:53 eating a meal and you know what the
43:55 pairing which they call you eating two
43:57 things at once will make you feel like
44:01 some people I've seen actually eat
44:03 dinner and keep a cigar on the table
44:05 which is because they're eating in a
44:06 patio or something I have never eaten
44:09 and smoking at the exact same time to my
44:11 knowledge but the other way to cut open
44:15 a cigar which I neglected was one of my
44:17 favourite ways of doing it which is
44:18 called a V cutter and V cutters are
44:21 these they look like guillotines but
44:23 they have a v-shaped blade in them they
44:27 also have a guide in them and such that
44:30 you could just push the cigar against a
44:32 V cutter you can't go through the cutter
44:35 so you actually could do it in the dark
44:37 without being able to see anything and
44:39 you'll cut it perfectly every single
44:40 time I bought a $90 V cutter seven years
44:46 ago and it's still as sharp as it was
44:48 the first day it seems today I have not
44:52 been able to keep a guillotine sharp for
44:54 more than a year ever I'll keep him but
44:58 it's like scraping off the end of the
44:59 cigar right the punch punches last a
45:03 long time I know guys that have punches
45:05 on their keechak keychains that are 25
45:08 years old it's still punch it up because
45:10 it's just it's not doing a very it's not
45:13 very abrasive to the blade to cut open a
45:15 cigar because you're just poking this
45:16 thing like a little cookie cutter now in
45:19 terms of what you're gonna taste and
45:21 what someone else says you're gonna
45:22 taste well there'll be about as accurate
45:25 as your friend telling you how a peanut
45:28 Buster parfait tastes or a steak of a
45:30 certain type dazed or a lobster taste
45:32 you have preferences that are different
45:34 than others so if you find anyone that
45:37 can give you tasting notes that's what
45:39 they call them that you agree with hang
45:43 on to that person because they can do a
45:45 lot of hard work for you spending a ton
45:47 money on cigars and they can find out
45:50 whether or not one is good or bad now
45:53 one of the things they don't tell you
45:54 about cigars but they tell you about
45:56 wine and it just baffles me this this
45:59 information doesn't travel better is it
46:01 just like wine where they have a good
46:03 year of grapes and then a bad year of
46:05 grapes but it's the same vineyard same
46:09 thing goes for cigars all right the
46:13 Harris delis are have been phenomenal
46:16 for for ages but about I'd say about
46:20 three years ago the tips which are
46:22 typically fairly a she in all cigars
46:24 except for Cubans which I'm going to get
46:27 into on the end here the tip of the
46:30 cigar was actually really buttery I mean
46:34 it tastes like a stick of butter coming
46:36 through tobacco utterly phenomenal was
46:38 like one of my favorite things about
46:39 lighting up or Herrera still he was the
46:42 last half-inch I don't know what was
46:45 causing that I don't know if it was the
46:46 blend I don't know if it was some weird
46:48 humidification I was dealing with but it
46:50 was gorgeous it doesn't happen right now
46:52 and that's alright
46:54 it changed it's still great cigar the
46:57 baccarat s-- they used to smoke baccarat
46:59 is the cigarette cigar I'm holding in
47:01 the thumbnail video of season one it's a
47:05 cheapy cigar you can get it for about
47:07 three dollars and fifty cents but five
47:09 years ago you could get the sticks and I
47:13 guess probably three years ago to you
47:14 get the stick and it was sweet it was a
47:18 sweet wrap around the outside so you put
47:19 it on your lips and it would taste like
47:21 someone rolled it in some Jolly Rancher
47:24 apple flavor was it that strong but it
47:27 was sort of like that flavor then the
47:30 internals of the cigar the filler of the
47:33 old baccarat s-- were just beautiful all
47:35 the way to the last puff very light but
47:38 nice definitely a short filler get about
47:40 45 minutes to an hour out of one I run
47:43 my mouth la slang in an hour out of
47:44 almost anything but about a year and a
47:49 half later it got real ended whatever
47:52 their source tobacco was to get the
47:54 baccarat stick started they no longer
47:56 have that tobacco anymore and so now it
48:00 is
48:01 not sweet on the wrapper and in the last
48:04 two inches of the cigar it is tari and
48:07 sort of I think and intolerable but they
48:12 again I've then again I've kind of
48:14 upgraded my smoking habits quite a bit
48:17 over the last year and a half as I've
48:18 been hanging out with guys that really
48:19 know what they're talking about now a
48:22 couple things before we go into Cubans
48:25 here the color of the wrapper is not
48:28 indicative of how strong it is it can be
48:32 indicative of how strong it is you
48:35 really have to ask the person because
48:37 again the wrapper is just a tiny tiny
48:38 part of the flavor profile but they
48:41 typically kind of mix the really strong
48:43 cigars with the darker wrappers just so
48:45 you have some indication but I smoke a
48:48 lot of cigars that are damn near black
48:50 and they are just as light as this in
48:53 fact some of them have very sweet
48:54 wrappers the eight five eight series
48:55 sun-grown wrapper or the natural wrapper
48:58 from point-a line is really sweet and
49:04 you know it tastes like a cigar but I
49:06 mean the wrapper is very sweet and it
49:08 doesn't hit me really bad and this is
49:10 where we're going to get into how you
49:12 pick your cigar when you walk into cigar
49:14 shop there is something called body and
49:19 there's something that called strength
49:21 the body is the flavor it is everything
49:25 associated with flavor and nothing to do
49:27 with how strong it's gonna be on your
49:29 blood sugar levels right the strength is
49:32 the power of the tobacco how much you're
49:36 gonna actually absorb when you're
49:37 smoking and that will determine how
49:39 loopy you get or lightheaded you get it
49:42 when you smoke I do not know a single
49:44 person that isn't a shop owner or a
49:48 cigar expert that really longs for
49:52 strong cigars strong cigars are for guys
49:55 have been smoking for a really long time
49:57 that just need a kick it's like a lot of
49:59 you guys that get into really spicy food
50:01 as you get older because you're just
50:02 simply tired of mild food you want to
50:05 have some kick you want to have it to be
50:07 almost like a challenge to eat the meal
50:08 right
50:09 same thing with strong cigars I do not
50:12 like strong cigars
50:14 I think it's [ __ ] I don't want to I
50:17 know I don't have any need to prove my
50:20 manlihood by getting sick right it was
50:24 funny as a lot of these guys who are
50:26 very seasoned smokers they will smoke
50:30 those big cigars but then they they will
50:34 report that they're sick and they didn't
50:36 like the experience and they will have
50:37 been smoking for thirty years so don't
50:40 believe the hype is all I'm gonna say so
50:42 when you walk into a place and they say
50:44 well what kind of sticks do you smoke
50:46 if you know a brand that you love go for
50:50 it
50:50 I would recommend a herrera steli if you
50:52 got a chance right the under crown is
50:55 pretty good too which is another Jewish
50:56 state stick the League of privada not
51:00 one of my favorite Jura States I think
51:01 it's a little too heavy and way
51:03 overpriced for the experience what you
51:06 want to say when you walk in is I want a
51:08 full body light strength cigar and they
51:12 should be able to hook you up with what
51:14 you're looking for now the the beauty of
51:18 it is is you might walk into a place and
51:20 the guy doesn't know anything about
51:22 cigars but he sells them you better know
51:25 your stuff before you walk into that if
51:28 you're stuck but you really want a cigar
51:30 in this the only place in town just look
51:32 at the wrapper and look for what's
51:34 called a Connecticut wrapper and without
51:36 knowing which one's a Connecticut
51:37 wrapper usually says it on the band or
51:40 on the box it's a really light wrapper
51:45 it's like it's sort of like the color of
51:49 maybe a light paper bag you would get at
51:53 the grocery store back in the day that's
51:55 usually connect your wrapper nine times
51:57 out of a 10 we're growing here in
51:58 America - those wrappers which is kind
52:00 of cool so if you get a Connecticut
52:02 wrapper you will typically have about if
52:04 you don't know what you're buying and
52:06 it's say under ten dollars you might be
52:09 dealing with a short filler which will
52:11 burn a little bit quicker which if your
52:12 new short fillers are great you don't
52:14 need to sit there for two hours and see
52:16 you figure out what you're gonna do for
52:17 two hours right I'll make a show when I
52:18 smoke almost exclusively except at night
52:21 I do work well that'll give you a
52:24 generic tip
52:26 about how to pick something out now
52:30 really super expensive cigars are which
52:33 would be anything over 20 bucks
52:35 you were almost unequivocally unless
52:38 you're getting scammed which is it
52:41 happens but mainly for Cuba Cuban
52:43 reasons you will be dealing with a long
52:45 filler and size will matter because it
52:49 will burn a really long time because
52:51 it'll be a long filler and it's super
52:53 long size now as I understand it you
52:57 know there's there's probably about 25
53:00 really popular recognizable sizes and
53:04 shapes that that you'll see in the
53:06 marketplace Churchill is made by Winston
53:10 Churchill it's a very long cigars one of
53:13 the longest cigars out there you have a
53:14 lance arrow which is a very thin cigar
53:17 which is very long in the land Sarah you
53:19 have a slightly different profile
53:21 because the wrapper plays a much bigger
53:23 role in the overall amount of tobacco
53:26 because it's really thin and really long
53:29 there the amount of wrapper on the
53:31 outside instead of being 2% of a cigars
53:33 composition might be 15 20 percent of
53:37 the cigars composition so it matters at
53:39 that point lanceros people either love
53:43 them or hate them and it's only for one
53:45 sort of lame reason in that keeping them
53:48 lit can be a chore if you're not steady
53:52 on your pulse because cigars will go out
53:54 if I put this cigar down right now at
53:57 this length and that amount of burn I
53:58 can come back tomorrow as long as I
54:00 haven't gotten it wet overnight or
54:03 something and I can continue smoking
54:04 this cigar now most people don't put out
54:07 cigars and pick them up the next day and
54:09 smoke them if you see that kind of habit
54:11 you're usually dealing with the rookie
54:13 or maybe on the complete flipside as a
54:16 total expert but because I've already
54:20 started smoking this I've already
54:21 started pulling a lot of the ash sit
54:23 through and into the cigar so it's best
54:27 that I go ahead and finish this because
54:28 tomorrow if I light it back up again I'm
54:30 gonna have that ashy flavor on top of
54:32 the flavor profile and because my mouth
54:34 will probably be clean cleaner from any
54:37 of the tobacco that I've been smoking up
54:39 to
54:39 this point on this particular session it
54:42 just won't taste that good but right now
54:44 I'm in the middle of all these flavors
54:46 cascading around and so continuing is
54:49 the way to roll trying to make sure I
54:51 got through all the basics here makeup
54:55 done a fairly good job let me tell you
54:57 my experience with Cuban cigars since
54:59 Cuba is getting freed up a little bit in
55:02 terms of ridiculous ancient State
55:05 Department sanctions the first time I
55:09 ever really started smoking cigars
55:11 I was actually selling them at a biker
55:13 convention in Laughlin Nevada I had a
55:18 couple guys come up to me and see if I
55:20 had any Cubans and I didn't of course
55:23 and I said no I said you know but but
55:27 our seeds come from Cuba and we've grown
55:30 them in the new world South America
55:32 Nicaragua Dominican Republic that sort
55:35 of thing and they just walked away it
55:37 was like it's kind of shitty what's up
55:40 with this Cuban thing and so I asked
55:42 people about Cubans all the time cuz I
55:44 didn't know I was like I never smoked
55:46 one is it really that intense and
55:48 someone would say you know no it's a
55:52 bunch of hype and then some people would
55:56 say oh yeah completely different
55:58 experience so I'm going to tell you the
56:01 truth about Cubans here I don't know
56:05 exactly know why this is such a profound
56:08 thing but Cuba is obviously its own
56:11 little island there but the shape of
56:13 this island the way the hills go up and
56:17 down and the precipitation that they get
56:21 and the soil that they have having grown
56:24 I guess tons of sugar cane for a while
56:28 as I understand it's totally different
56:29 regions on them on the island but I can
56:32 only assume that whatever was grown
56:35 there before has had a profound effect
56:36 on the way the tobacco tastes from Cuba
56:40 because the truth of the matter is a
56:44 Cuban cigar tastes almost entirely
56:48 different than all other cigars on
56:50 planet Earth and I mean it is almost
56:53 you know you still get a tobacco flavor
56:56 don't get me wrong but you get a taste
57:00 that is just my opinion it's just out of
57:03 this world and it's more of a subtle
57:07 profile of sort of a hashish tobacco
57:12 it's sort of we can get your leather in
57:15 your woods and your beans and all that
57:17 good stuff
57:17 but there's just this this predominant
57:21 mellow flavor on top of it which is sort
57:25 of a hash tobacco that's all I can
57:27 describe to you and I've smoked dozens
57:30 and dozens and dozens of Cuban cigars
57:32 I mean I've probably smoked over 150
57:35 Cuban cigars and probably have achieved
57:38 I would say 20 different bands brands I
57:44 should say I've smoked 1981 davit offs
57:48 from Cuba I mean you know incredible the
57:54 key is a couple things here if I flew to
57:58 Cuba tomorrow and I picked up a whole
58:01 bunch of Cubans and I flew back to your
58:03 house and I said dude I got us some
58:05 brand new Cubans and I lay them on the
58:06 table pick which one you want and we
58:08 smoked it now what's gonna happen is
58:10 you're gonna go oh yeah that is
58:11 different that is really different but
58:14 if I took those Cubans and I put him in
58:17 a humidor and properly took care of them
58:20 for at least two years and then came
58:23 back two years later nice I'd remember
58:25 these like oh yeah I remember those this
58:27 is pretty good smoked this one well
58:29 isn't it the same as the other one
58:30 mm-hmm two years old and you smoked it
58:33 completely different amazing flavor I
58:36 mean it's the it's a similar profile in
58:39 terms of its taste but it's gonna be
58:40 more mellow more amazing each year that
58:45 goes by now when you get the cigar - ten
58:49 years all right then you're talking
58:52 about a flavor that is really unlike any
58:59 flavor you'll ever get and I I dare say
59:01 you will never get this flavor in any
59:04 other cigar other than a Cuban
59:06 and that is what we call the medicinal
59:09 bouquet it's a sweet medicinal bouquet
59:13 which sounds awful right it sounds like
59:14 you're gonna be smoking a cough syrup
59:16 not the case why don't you taste it
59:20 inside of a Cuban you can get teeny tiny
59:22 hints of it and other cigars that aren't
59:23 that our new world but the medicinal
59:29 flavor is something that once you taste
59:31 it and you usually get it to a retro L
59:33 what I like to do with the Cuban that's
59:36 really medicinal is smoke it inside a
59:39 garage so I don't have any wind throwing
59:41 away throwing away all my beautiful foot
59:43 smoke I like to let it roll up my face
59:47 and kind of go up into my nostrils and
59:50 smell it and you can have the tiniest
59:53 gauge a 42 ring gauge Cuban it's this
59:58 probably no longer than you know your
60:01 half of your hand right
60:03 probably but from my thumb is up to the
60:05 top of my finger it'll smoke for an hour
60:08 and 45 minutes crazy and you will just
60:11 smoke this thing and if you if you
60:15 actually closed the garage door and
60:17 smoke it inside of a closed room that's
60:19 where you can get your garage to smell
60:21 amazing but you'll also just bathe in
60:24 this amazing Cuban flavor that you just
60:27 simply can't get anywhere in the world
60:29 right once you smoke a few Cubans if you
60:34 have the experience I'm talking about
60:35 here your really difficult to go back to
60:38 any other cigar but you will go back to
60:41 the old cheaper cigars and new world
60:44 cigars and believe me there's beautiful
60:46 new world cigars for us me but you use
60:49 that to wear down your palate away from
60:52 the beautiful Cuban flavor and you'll
60:54 come back a week later two days later
60:56 whatever and drag your Cuban out and all
61:00 sudden you get to have that unique
61:01 experience now most cigar shops that
61:06 have a lot of business to them unless
61:09 they're very special places they won't
61:12 have any aged anything inside their shop
61:15 besides the crappy cigar ain't selling
61:17 what's interesting about it is that
61:19 unlike a bad wine which I'm not sure if
61:23 this happens but I don't think you can
61:24 take a bad wine aged it and it becomes
61:27 good wine maybe you can I haven't heard
61:30 that happen before no one's ever told me
61:33 oh you got a shitty wine we'll just keep
61:34 it on the shelf for five years and then
61:36 drink it after that'll be amazing
61:37 but that's what can happen to normal
61:41 cigars that are a little too pungent a
61:43 little too strong when you just let him
61:46 mellow out for a little while again a
61:47 couple years it's amazing now a lot of
61:51 cigar shops that have boxes of cigars
61:53 unless again they're SuperDuper popular
61:55 by name they will be in that box if you
61:59 go to the bottom or you go to the box
62:01 and there's just a couple sticks on the
62:02 bottom you might be technically smoking
62:05 a stick that's two years old that's what
62:10 happens with my Harris till he's only
62:12 one place in town that sells them and
62:13 I'm the one guy that buys the most of
62:16 them so by the time I get to the bottom
62:19 of the box it's about a year and a half
62:20 later because they smoked other things
62:22 too you know the other big thing is
62:24 you'll hear guys say stay ashy there's a
62:28 big religion about the ash and how long
62:31 the ash can stay on the cigar before
62:33 falling off having talked to a lot of
62:38 guys that have smoked for decades and
62:40 decades and decades I will tell you that
62:42 none of them play the ash game they look
62:45 at that as a absolute sign of utter
62:47 rookie nasai I have to agree with them
62:51 to be honest now what we typically do is
62:54 try to let it get about half an inch on
62:55 there because it does hold the cherry on
62:58 real well and it keeps the keeps the
63:00 thing more razor sharp burn right but
63:03 some guys will try to hang on to this
63:04 Ash four inches and inches and inches
63:07 and then they'll post photographs of it
63:08 really long and hey man if that's fun
63:10 for you then just get into it and enjoy
63:12 because doesn't hurt anybody's
63:14 experience around you but I wouldn't
63:17 throw that out there as you're an expert
63:19 if you hang on to your ash I think it's
63:22 just something that kind of became a
63:23 game that people play in the end people
63:27 who try to play the ash game are covered
63:29 in ashes because they will hang on till
63:31 it till it drops on their lap
63:32 and then you you have this suit on your
63:36 body which you can't always completely
63:37 wipe off and you can also carry the
63:40 cherry with it and here comes this ball
63:43 of fire with the ash right I've got
63:45 scars on my body from firing guns and
63:47 smoking cigars at the same time and not
63:49 realizing the concussion from my gun is
63:51 not gonna ash off I didn't feel it but
63:54 it's on my arm it's burning a hole in me
63:55 and so I've got some loving scars from
63:59 from weaponry and cigars mixed together
64:02 now in terms of brands that you might be
64:05 interested in it's really tough there
64:07 are literally hundreds and hundreds of
64:10 brands that are folded under dozens and
64:14 dozens of manufacturers
64:16 cigar makers some of the there are some
64:21 that are just great staples out there
64:23 and there's some that are sort of blown
64:24 up a portion which is sort of sad
64:27 because they get more expensive than
64:29 more that people blow them out of
64:31 proportion because it's just a supply
64:33 and demand thing Rocky Patel
64:36 it makes probably some of the best
64:38 cigars in the world under ten bucks and
64:40 just around ten bucks or a little bit
64:42 over now Rock all brands make really
64:45 expensive versions too so I'm just
64:48 trying to give you some options if
64:49 you're starting out again I think
64:51 anything drew estates pretty good again
64:53 League of privada starts about seventeen
64:55 bucks where I live and I've had a couple
64:57 and yeah they're just not seventeen
65:01 dollars worth of my time I'll tell you
65:03 that right now
65:04 but drones are extremely popular but
65:08 Padron's are really popular like the
65:10 tequila patron you know it gets to a
65:13 point where it's such a it's such a
65:17 hyped up brand that you really have to
65:19 be careful with how much you pay for it
65:22 Boudreau makes some amazing stuff you
65:24 know $20 and over and they make some
65:26 great stuff down towards the $10 mark
65:29 wente is almost always an excellent
65:34 experience twenties are typically smoked
65:37 a little bit drier than other cigars
65:39 depending on where you buy them the
65:42 place where I smoke on a daily basis
65:44 likes all of his cigars very dry and
65:46 he's a
65:46 when teh addict 20 also makes something
65:50 called the oppa sex and the oppa sexist
65:52 the the the key brand reference and then
65:56 they have all different types of oppa
65:57 sexes the oppa sex is a really unique
66:00 experience they're usually about 20
66:02 bucks minimum usually about 30 bucks
66:06 just so that you know but it's like
66:09 smoking a fruitcake
66:10 it's got raisins in it and I mean
66:13 there's enough raisins in it but it
66:14 tastes like you're smoking a fruitcake
66:17 it's just kind of all kinds of wild
66:18 flavors and I know most of you would go
66:20 yuck that sounds gross but coming
66:22 through the overall signature of tobacco
66:24 all these wild flavors are tremendous
66:28 the other thing you can do to figure out
66:30 whether or not you like a cigar or none
66:32 is not to buy it but sit next to someone
66:36 who's smoking it and smell their foot
66:38 smoke or their exhale usually their foot
66:40 smoke and if you like the foot smoke
66:42 then the chances are you're gonna be a
66:44 lot more prone to like the cigar itself
66:46 a couple other great brands is punch
66:49 punch use it makes a pretty good brand
66:51 that I mean they make a lot of amazing
66:53 cigars down towards the $10 mark a punch
66:56 will get actually pretty darn strong
66:59 it's at least a medium to a full body
67:01 cigar or excuse me full strength cigar
67:03 it's in my opinion they've been fairly
67:06 monotone with body whatever signature
67:10 you get about an inch into the cigars
67:11 what's gonna be like all the way at the
67:13 bottom Macanudo is another great
67:16 Connecticut cigar to start out with
67:19 they're a little overpriced well I don't
67:22 want the over price but they're they're
67:24 nine to ten dollars here that used to be
67:26 cheaper before California got its extra
67:28 ridiculous tax on them but it is a very
67:32 solid stick it has a bit of what we call
67:34 pepper pepper you will find not in the
67:37 rarest le when you smoke a cigar and you
67:40 pull away and you let the smoke out and
67:42 your your mouth is ringing almost like
67:44 you bit down on a black pepper not
67:47 peppers as in you know chilies that you
67:50 might cook with but like a black pepper
67:51 when you start feeling that ringing in
67:53 your mouth as I'm told it's one of the
67:56 cheaper flavors that a cigar blender can
68:00 give you
68:00 so in terms of the cost that it takes to
68:03 create the pepper taste it's a lot less
68:07 but a Macanudo has got a beautiful
68:11 balance of just beginners low strength
68:15 cigar I mean you you would have to work
68:18 pretty fast to get yourself
68:19 high on a Macanudo and again the more
68:22 you smoke it quickly if your cigarette
68:24 smoker and you move two cigars you might
68:26 be prone to take drags way too often and
68:29 then that's just going to you know
68:31 increase your blood sugar level
68:34 displacement you might a little high
68:35 slow down eat some sugar get yourself
68:38 bounced out again always smoke on a full
68:40 stomach if you can even if you just
68:42 squeeze down a hot dog before you eat
68:44 before you smoke it's a way to go but
68:48 the Macanudo is a great one Romeo and
68:50 Juliet one of the oldest brands in the
68:51 world they make Cubans they make new
68:54 world cigars you almost can't go wrong
68:57 with a Romeo and Julieta until you get
69:00 around six bucks you get some gigantic
69:03 cigars for six bucks and the Romeo and
69:06 Juliet realm just know you're gonna have
69:08 less of a less body less variance you
69:13 won't get three transitions in the cigar
69:15 except to say towards the end the cigar
69:19 gets really usually really heavy so it's
69:21 a really strange thing that that Romeo
69:24 and Juliet it would almost be like sort
69:28 of like Piaget polo who makes a you know
69:30 $50,000 watch also makes a five-dollar
69:33 watch and you would kind of ask yourself
69:35 why do you even make this five-dollar
69:37 watch it kind of insults your brand
69:38 that's sort of where Romeo and Julieta
69:41 is because they're Cubans are utterly
69:43 phenomenal cigars just pick any one of
69:46 them and they're just you close your
69:47 eyes and pick any Cuban cigar in general
69:49 usually what I have found it be pretty
69:52 consistent is the following similar to
69:56 wine similar the more money you spend
69:59 the better the cigar the more that the
70:02 full body guarantee shows up for
70:05 business now again the cheaper cigars
70:08 will typically be randomly full-strength
70:11 cigars which will kind of put you off
70:14 your game you'd be like man I was gonna
70:15 get into cigars I smoked this $5.00
70:18 stick or $6 stick and I was so nauseous
70:20 it was gross just understand that would
70:22 be the same thing as you smoking or
70:24 sorry drinking a to buck chuck and
70:27 coming away with a headache because of
70:29 all the crazy you know aluminum aging
70:33 that they do or they know if you know
70:35 this about wine but real wine which is
70:38 pretty much $35 and over is always aged
70:41 in wood in a wood barrel under that they
70:45 do what's called aluminum barrel aging
70:48 where they take wood they burn it
70:51 they literally burn the wood and they
70:53 stick that burn wood just like out of
70:55 your fireplace not the ashes but the
70:56 logs itself they're all black they stick
70:58 it inside the inside the wine inside the
71:02 aluminum barrel it does a rapid fire
71:05 aging to make it taste woody then they
71:08 strain it trying to get out all those
71:10 toxins from the from the carcinogens
71:12 from the wood and in the end it's not
71:15 filtered very well and you get these
71:16 horrible headaches because your body's
71:18 just rejecting it completely diabetics
71:21 aren't allowed to drink wine under 35
71:23 bucks because the way that the sugar is
71:26 fermented and added to the wine is too
71:29 sugary in the end but they can they can
71:32 drink all day a $75 bottle of wine
71:35 without having any type of insulin shock
71:37 now let's say you get into this you dig
71:41 it but your loved ones they're like dad
71:44 or honey you smell like crap I don't
71:49 like your breath I don't like the way
71:51 you smell out that I can smell it on you
71:53 here's the bummer here's the bummer
71:56 about it when you're sitting next to
71:58 someone smoking in a smoke lounge you
72:02 will love the foot smell coming off
72:04 their cigar as long as they're smoking
72:05 something decent and they will enjoy
72:06 yours and they'll go buy your cigar
72:08 smoke it right in front you right after
72:10 you teach them that your foot smoke
72:11 smells great and the vice versa but if
72:15 you were sitting in there and you
72:16 finished your cigar and everyone else
72:18 stopped someone you've got an ashtray
72:19 next to you if you can smell the quaff
72:23 off the ashtray it's gross it's just
72:26 like an ashtray
72:27 for a cigarette it smells gross nothing
72:31 good about it at all what you need to
72:33 understand is that the ambient smell off
72:36 of your body can smell very ashy to
72:39 someone who didn't smoke with you that's
72:43 why you stink to them they have none of
72:47 the taste profile in their mouth in
72:49 their nose they're not getting anything
72:51 else out of experience remember we can't
72:54 taste unless we have functional nose
72:56 follicles that can do it right so we're
72:59 getting this huge profile in here and
73:00 they're not okay so if you got to reset
73:03 yourself for your family such that you
73:06 don't smell awful
73:07 I will warn you that there's almost
73:10 nothing you can do to get yourself
73:11 completely clear unless you were to
73:13 smoke perhaps like a Macanudo or any
73:17 type of Connecticut wrapper that barely
73:19 has any flavor on it that way you don't
73:22 have a lot of soot inside your mouth and
73:24 your nose but you're gonna have to come
73:25 home take a shower wash your hair switch
73:30 out your clothes depending on if you how
73:33 tolerant your spouse is you may have to
73:34 put those clothes directly in the
73:36 washing machine to get them away from
73:38 any other smell in the bedroom or
73:41 wherever the hell you keep your dirty
73:42 clothes you got to brush your teeth you
73:46 have to brush the crap out of your teeth
73:48 and most importantly double triple
73:50 quadruple brush your tongue remember
73:53 your tongue goes back quite a ways and
73:54 so all those taste buds are on the
73:56 literally the the little mound rep
73:59 before goes down your throat you need to
74:00 rub those things out with the toothbrush
74:02 my gag a few times you get rest that
74:06 crap out there if you look at your
74:07 toothbrush you're gonna see brown on the
74:08 toothbrush the bummer is you're enjoying
74:11 the flavor of all this and now you're
74:12 wiping it out of your mouth which is
74:13 just the price you pay sometimes but
74:17 there are two places that the smoke
74:18 hides that are a little tougher to get
74:20 to one is up inside your nasal canal
74:23 unless you've got a nasal rinse and
74:25 you're familiar with using that you're
74:27 gonna carry around a lot of the soot up
74:28 inside your nose but the one place
74:31 you're not going to be able to
74:34 clean out as your lungs you got a little
74:37 bit of dusts of this in your lungs what
74:41 you will find is if you can stay fairly
74:44 and if you eat a meal fairly soon after
74:46 you do all this other ritual you'll be
74:49 pretty much 90% clean but you got 10%
74:52 down inside your lungs if you do
74:56 something that makes you you breathe
74:58 fast people will smell it off of you all
75:02 right I'll let you imagine what that
75:04 could be you could be really close to
75:06 someone breathing fast and they're gonna
75:08 go whoa what is that smell that's
75:10 horrible you're lucky if your spouse
75:14 likes the smell of cigars all right you
75:17 know if your spouse smoke cigarettes
75:19 usually there's oh okay I could tell you
75:21 this I've dated people that smoke
75:23 cigarettes and they do not like this
75:25 small cigars it's just really
75:27 unfortunate cigars will mellow you out
75:31 they take your thought process that may
75:34 be agitated and it it harmonizes it into
75:38 a long wave is what I like to say so one
75:41 of the reasons why I enjoy smoking
75:43 cigars while doing this show is it helps
75:45 my particular visual memory mechanisms
75:47 really just smooth out I have like a
75:52 photo album of everything I'm thinking
75:53 about right there and new photos can be
75:56 introduced so they're Gnostic lis from
75:58 the universe to say oh don't forget this
76:00 don't forget that and it's really pretty
76:03 phenomenal when I do an episode without
76:06 some we're going to cigar which I do
76:07 every once in a while it's a little
76:10 tougher to keep my thoughts perfectly in
76:13 track if I get interrupted if I don't
76:16 get interrupted it's okay so for the
76:19 similar reasons that people smoke
76:20 cigarettes to get calm although that's a
76:24 more frantic you know quick pull on a
76:26 cigarette cigars will have its own
76:30 functionality right now the disclaimer
76:33 is obviously as I mentioned at the
76:34 beginning you can be allergic to certain
76:36 substances in your body and what that
76:39 means is your body's going to try to
76:40 reject it on the level it'll may make
76:43 you feel sick and it may actually
76:45 metabolize into something else
76:47 again anything that isn't indigenous to
76:50 your body is is potentially a carcinogen
76:53 right so you just need to smoke
76:56 carefully and see if it's having an ill
76:58 effects if you get rashes or something
77:00 or get really itchy or something you may
77:02 have an allergic reaction to tobacco you
77:05 may actually have allergic reactions to
77:07 some cigars and not to others because of
77:09 the way it's manufactured is a little
77:11 looser and it's just like a bad wine
77:13 gives you a headache and a good wine you
77:16 didn't have a hangover that's tremendous
77:18 right so you're gonna have to find where
77:19 your body is most compatible with the
77:22 cigar you know we have George Carlin I'm
77:26 sorry George Burns excuse me you lived
77:29 to be 100 I think he smoked up to about
77:31 96 you know when you get older you
77:35 really need all the oxygen you can get
77:37 but I mean living to 100 is pretty good
77:38 Bob Hope did the same thing
77:40 Castro smoked oh I think he was 95 96 he
77:42 lived to be 100 I think right so you
77:45 have all these guys Winston Churchill
77:48 these guys smoked dozens of cigars a day
77:52 and they did not drop dead of cancer so
77:54 there's any direct association it's got
77:57 to be related to your body's ability to
78:00 have tobacco in his bloodstream
78:02 and not cause any issues again
78:05 cigarettes are just packed with all
78:07 kinds of toxins you're smoking paper not
78:10 a natural substance right cigars will
78:14 become if you get into them they become
78:17 an item of you if it's a nostalgic
78:22 process but again if 300 people touch
78:26 the average cigar even it's a boy right
78:29 which is the super cheap cigar that you
78:32 can buy at the grocery store which is
78:34 pretty awful 300 people touch the cigar
78:38 then more people have touched a cigar
78:40 than any of the finest wines in the
78:41 world you know so they become sort of
78:45 little works of art in your brain if I
78:47 taste good then the whole experience is
78:51 homogeneous with itself right it's
78:53 beautiful now the other thing too since
78:56 I'm getting to the last couple inches of
78:58 this cigar that I'm gonna smoke
79:01 when I was a well you know sometimes for
79:04 this way you get a great cigar it tastes
79:06 great all the way down to half an inch
79:07 that's beautiful but a lot of cigars to
79:11 no fault of their own when they get down
79:13 to the last inch and a half the the
79:16 amount of tobacco again is really hot
79:18 which is not necessarily a pleasant
79:20 experience anymore the amount of Sun of
79:23 city intense doubling up of all the
79:27 flavor profiles can get sort of
79:28 unpleasant you know don't be afraid to
79:32 go ahead and throw it on the ground
79:33 because what'll happen is if you over
79:36 smoke a cigar where you kind of reach
79:38 the point where you're just doing it
79:39 because it cost you ten bucks or more
79:41 you will leave yourself with sort of a
79:44 negative experience at the end if you're
79:46 trying to quit go right to the bottom
79:47 and it will start kicking your ass and
79:49 you'll get out of it but when I first
79:51 heard about throwing away a cigar at the
79:54 band I was just so confused and now it
79:57 completely makes sense to me just
79:59 understand if you go all the way down to
80:00 the bottom you could be left with the
80:03 flavor you're not really that happy with
80:05 all right
80:07 as far as cosmetic changes to your body
80:10 I make it a habit to wash my face after
80:14 a day of smoking so every day before I
80:16 go to bed I just take soap and water
80:18 wash my face off completely all the way
80:21 down in my neck and all that stuff
80:22 because I don't like all that stood on
80:23 my skin because it can cause little tiny
80:25 pimples all over your skin not the kind
80:28 of pimples you have when you were a kid
80:30 but just these really words surface
80:32 pimples and if you continually allow
80:34 that to be on your face every single day
80:36 all the way through the night your skin
80:39 will start looking shitty so make sure
80:41 you cleanse your face in fact you'll
80:44 find out that I found out that that
80:46 little ritual before bed it makes me
80:48 more sleepy it's really interesting but
80:52 now the other thing that you can do that
80:54 you have to be careful women will tell
80:55 you this who smoke cigarettes is that
80:58 when you know people get Botox and Botox
81:02 injections to deaden various muscle
81:05 groups in their face so I said they
81:07 don't have any wrinkles in their face
81:08 right make some young supple looking
81:11 right when you pucker up and you
81:14 on a cigar right you are puckering a
81:18 bunch of muscles in your in your mouth
81:20 region which is one of the most complex
81:22 muscle groups in your face your factor
81:24 your whole body right you will build up
81:29 muscles almost like you build up your
81:31 biceps the only problem is is that if
81:34 you were to look at the anatomy of all
81:36 the muscles in your mouth
81:38 I'll especially on the exterior part
81:40 you're gonna have grooves between
81:42 muscles and so you'll start getting
81:44 crow's feet is what they call it right
81:45 around your mouth now women get that a
81:49 little bit faster than men with
81:51 cigarettes men can get it with cigars
81:54 just as well all right I've got a little
81:57 muscle on my lower left lip I think it
81:59 is that it indents when I pull on a
82:02 cigar now that didn't exist a couple
82:04 years ago when I didn't smoke and so I
82:07 tracked that in my own mind to make sure
82:09 you know if I were to ever start looking
82:11 like a dried up potato I would have to
82:14 make a choice as to whether I'm gonna
82:16 have revealed recover and whether I'm
82:18 gonna continue smoking at all right your
82:21 genetics will ultimately determine how
82:23 that affects you right but I think
82:25 overall get the smoke off your face
82:27 regardless and you'll you'll think your
82:30 lucky stars I know guys that smoke five
82:33 cigars a day and their face is just
82:35 covered with this crazy in human texture
82:39 and I think it's because they don't wash
82:42 their face and if you smoke that much in
82:44 one day you should probably wash in your
82:46 face three or four times a day so and
82:50 the other thing that men don't really
82:51 think about much which men women remind
82:53 us from time to time usually soaps are
82:55 pretty abrasive to your skin they take
82:57 away a lot of oils that should exist on
82:59 your face so you might grab a little bit
83:01 of your wife's you know face you know
83:04 skin lotion or whatever meant for the
83:06 face and we're even we're sure as you
83:07 face a little bit where you might have
83:08 dry skin because you're over washing
83:11 your face typically when you get older
83:14 your the oil on your skin will reduce
83:17 with age and so you'll need to add some
83:19 of that stuff anyway
83:20 so don't be stupid don't be all macho
83:23 sorry to look tough but
83:26 you know let that be a natural process
83:28 and that's something you accelerate
83:30 right I think that's about all I have I
83:32 wanted to put this in a really clean
83:34 episode I think I'm gonna ask my friend
83:37 Dave to rerecord the one that we did
83:38 together because it's just a little too
83:40 chaotic we're gonna groove on I always
83:44 forget when I'm interviewing someone
83:46 there's a certain tone that I have to
83:48 maintain that I didn't maintain in that
83:49 particular episode so we'll get that
83:51 reshot here anyway deep thoughts
83:55 radio.com for all the other shows that
83:57 aren't about cigars I thought I'm
84:00 getting enough questions about this I
84:02 want to make this laser focused on what
84:04 you need to know just get in and out
84:06 really quickly and make your decision
84:07 again you could try it and hate it you
84:10 could hate it and never try it at least
84:11 you'll know more information about it
84:13 because there's nothing more
84:16 emasculating than walking into a
84:17 situation or when smoking cigars you
84:20 have no knowledge of how these things
84:21 work because that was me about eight
84:24 years ago it was just like a pup and the
84:28 thing that was really craziest no one
84:30 sat me down and taught me anything it
84:32 really sucked the very first time I ever
84:34 learned anything about cigars was Brian
84:36 Glenn's cigar obsession show on YouTube
84:38 which is an excellent show as well to
84:41 get kind of the just thousands of cigar
84:44 reviews that he has now he has a palette
84:46 that's sort of off the charts in terms
84:48 of tasting things so if you agree with
84:50 what he says he tastes then and watch
84:53 all his guards but if nothing else you
84:54 learn a lot from him my buddy Dave is a
84:57 great show which I'll link down below
84:58 which he reviews unicorn's cigars that
85:02 you and I may never see in our lifetime
85:04 I did want to say just before I totally
85:08 Sun off here there are a really small
85:10 group of cigars even Cubans that are
85:12 machine rolled very rare I've only had a
85:16 couple from Dave and they're beautiful
85:18 they're just as just as great as other
85:20 cigars but there's nothing like a hand
85:23 rolled cigars period the machine rolled
85:25 cigars are usually pretty small engaged
85:26 ring gauge I haven't seen a really big
85:29 one so you know if you find one don't
85:34 totally crap on it could be a great
85:35 cigar but you know once you fall in love
85:38 with handmade things
85:39 you tend to stay with him right like I
85:43 said deep thoughts video calm for all
85:44 the feeds there's video if you're an
85:46 audio audio if you're on video your
85:49 audio choices are iTunes Google Play and
85:52 just the website to get the RSS feed
85:53 into your telephone don't try to go on
85:55 your on your desktop computer that won't
85:57 work your video choices are youtube.com
85:59 and vid me which is a brand new series
86:03 out there I tried v-mail but they want
86:05 to charge me a bunch of money so goodbye
86:08 v-mail anyway take care of yourself and
86:12 someone else have a good smoke and I'll
86:14 see in the next deep thoughts over now
