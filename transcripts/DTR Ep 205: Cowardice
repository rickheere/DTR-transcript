00:00 [Music]
00:32 good evening ladies and gentlemen good
00:34 morning good afternoon whatever time
00:38 frame you are in today I'm going to talk
00:41 about something I have observed my
00:44 entire life and I think it's important
00:48 that we understand it and perhaps if
00:55 you're stuck in the middle of a identity
00:57 crisis about who you are this might help
01:02 quite a bit but today is about cowardice
01:07 cowardice comes in so many categories of
01:10 life there's mental cowardice there's
01:13 physical cowardice there's integrity
01:17 cowardice and when you're young you'll
01:22 feel cowardice around you people who are
01:24 being that way maybe even fill it in
01:26 yourself when you get overwhelmed but
01:29 what I've kind of come to the conclusion
01:31 is well obviously when you get older you
01:33 can see it just like a stinky cologne
01:35 man you can just see it you can see a
01:38 cologne like that but the most classic
01:42 thing I've seen is that wherever a
01:44 person's cowardice is they typically put
01:47 on a show maybe it's only 50% of people
01:51 do this but I haven't had any problem
01:54 finding an infinite supply of these
01:55 folks but they put on a show that that
02:00 is where they are the strongest and you
02:03 know you sort of take on
02:04 responsibilities when you say you're
02:07 you're capable of withstanding something
02:11 and standing up to something
02:13 to be again something inside your mind
02:15 you willing to stand up for your eating
02:18 habits your religious habits or whatever
02:21 to the point where you're willing to
02:22 stand up to protect something in the
02:24 real world from a justice but in my
02:28 experience what I have in my life
02:31 experience what I have discovered is the
02:35 big it's really strange the bigger a guy
02:38 is a puts on a huge show of how tough he
02:44 is
02:45 and it usually just running his mouth
02:47 right there definitely folks that are
02:49 the whole package
02:50 thank God there's a lot of guys that run
02:55 their mouths and they are so amazing
02:59 when you just take the story of their
03:01 life and the story of their capability
03:03 and you just listen to the words coming
03:08 out of their mouths which is just their
03:10 visual perception of who they are
03:12 it's the persona that they've created
03:14 that they are trying to believe about
03:16 themselves and honestly there's nothing
03:19 wrong with creating something you want
03:21 to be and then you become that that's
03:22 fine as long as you become it as long as
03:25 every day you take a step in that
03:26 direction right the musician print so he
03:30 said you know I was a shy kid on my
03:32 basement making music and he goes I just
03:34 decided one day that I was going to
03:38 create the opposite persona and then act
03:41 out that guy then he goes eventually I
03:44 became that guy which is who I wanted to
03:46 be in the first place there's no problem
03:47 in my mind with you know ed being
03:52 towards it and understanding that you
03:54 understanding you have an actual issue
03:55 that you need to overcome like he
03:57 understood his issue right but if the
04:00 guy that bullshit's 24/7 and never takes
04:05 a step in that direction big tough guy
04:08 when he opens his [ __ ] mouth and it
04:10 really comes down to it nothing there
04:13 you know there's this joke going around
04:15 these days right for last 10 15 years
04:19 when someone says you know let me see
04:21 your man card I'm going to revoke your
04:24 man card
04:25 I think what's
04:27 the biggest danger and the reason why I
04:30 want to make this episode because
04:31 there's a lot of messed up people in the
04:33 world I don't need to make an episode
04:34 about every single one of them right but
04:38 this is a species that I've seen
04:40 recently around me where someone is
04:44 again just a badass with his mouth but
04:48 what it really comes down to brass tacks
04:50 and acknowledging the universe and you
04:54 know this world and he wants to complain
04:57 constantly about the world yet when you
05:00 bring him cause and effect models that
05:02 says well okay you want to fix this
05:04 shitty world right oh yeah well here's
05:06 one thing we got to start acknowledging
05:07 oh well don't you think that's just this
05:09 don't you think it's just that and he
05:12 pulls his [ __ ] panties up really high
05:13 over his bellybutton I'll tell ya I have
05:16 personally been surrounded by two types
05:18 of guys who are joint [ __ ] cowards
05:21 inside that run their [ __ ] mouth and
05:24 I [ __ ] hate him I absolutely hate him
05:26 one is the guy that you know every time
05:30 he recalls this history and what
05:31 happened he's just he's just the most
05:35 matter-of-fact you know I'll tell you to
05:37 go you know give you a chance and then
05:39 I'll tell you to [ __ ] yourself kind of
05:41 guy and every story is really super
05:42 grandiose and then what it really comes
05:46 down to it he's a pussycat you know
05:50 every time you see him interact with
05:51 someone in public it's oh ho thank you
05:53 I'm not that you should be an [ __ ]
05:54 right that's saying like I'm glorified
05:56 [ __ ] but when someone is doing them
06:00 injustice
06:01 you know they again they put on this
06:02 huge show and then eventually you find
06:03 out oh you you're actually a big [ __ ]
06:05 [ __ ] your whole life you've just been a
06:07 giant [ __ ] and you you talk [ __ ] in
06:09 front of your buddies that you're big
06:10 and tough but in real life you're
06:11 nothing so let you just be yourself
06:15 because we might come to rely on you
06:18 when we need some strength and you're
06:21 really just a hollow person right and
06:25 the second species I've seen and this is
06:28 all over the Midwest not very not very
06:30 dense but there's a couple guys the guy
06:32 devised 92 guns is typically the
06:37 antithesis of anybody that really knows
06:39 how to use them or would use them in a
06:41 I guess some post-apocalyptic situation
06:44 some Civil War situation there the last
06:46 guy that would be able to stomach
06:50 holding a gun and pointing it at another
06:52 human being in a dire situation to save
06:55 his own life or his loved ones or
06:57 someone else's life
06:59 the guns are merely there just to make
07:01 them feel kind of some artificial
07:04 security and what's really funny is when
07:07 you really meet a soldier who's seen the
07:10 [ __ ] when you meet people that have
07:11 lived really intense lives either a
07:13 gangbanger or mobster they are so humble
07:18 they are so relaxed because we've seen
07:23 it all and they've learned the [ __ ]
07:25 arc of a lot of that machoism you know
07:29 it was it was really exciting to watch
07:31 someone take someone's life on a movie
07:33 but the second they do it in real life
07:36 you know there's a couple moments I
07:39 think that you know you can rely on when
07:43 if you're there to see that your baby
07:45 come out of your wife or your wife you
07:47 know obviously is trying to see it but
07:49 as a male and stick with men you see
07:52 your kid come out of your spouse that's
07:55 a moment where God's right there and
07:57 says it see what I see what I was doing
08:00 there when I made this [ __ ] place
08:01 isn't that cool I mean do you feel your
08:04 responsibility because I'm giving it to
08:06 you I'm giving you this little
08:07 eyedropper responsibility now again if
08:10 you're out if you're out in the lobby
08:12 being a [ __ ] about it then obviously
08:14 you're not going to have this glorious
08:16 moment but I think the second one is
08:19 when you take a life when someone ceases
08:23 to exist in this world as a human being
08:26 and again the further away that that
08:28 happens you know if someone's about a
08:30 thousand yards out you take their life
08:32 and maybe you're not feeling it as much
08:35 but point-blank it's the opposite of
08:40 having a child into this universe but
08:42 that's when God goes you know I I told
08:45 you this wasn't supposed to happen you
08:48 don't get to take people out I get to
08:50 take people out
08:52 people who have done it in self-defense
08:54 feel horrible even when the other person
08:58 was being very clear I'm going to kill
09:00 you and you just between you and them
09:02 it's like pick your life for their life
09:04 that's it it's a heavy duty thing right
09:07 reason why I give you that digression or
09:09 that example is the guys that run their
09:13 [ __ ] mouth are the kind of guys that
09:18 never really really fallen a definitely
09:21 not experienced that kind of [ __ ] and
09:23 they they don't pay attention to what
09:25 they're saying and what it means they
09:28 might ask well why is this important
09:30 dude one I think that people who
09:33 [ __ ] themselves are really really
09:36 unhappy about looking in the mirror and
09:38 I think that they attempt to avoid a
09:40 mirror as much as possible they may be
09:45 able to create at adrenaline flow of
09:48 horseshit about themselves during a
09:50 conversation but the second is over the
09:53 crash that they have after that
09:55 bullshitting is very devastating to the
09:58 character I'm hoping that someone can
10:01 hear this who finds themselves either
10:04 directly in the middle of those kind of
10:05 examples of you're one of these kind of
10:07 guys but now you don't have to tell a
10:09 soul you never have to tell us so that
10:11 you were one of those guys and now
10:13 hearing my voice and listening to these
10:15 examples I'm hoping that you could dig
10:17 yourself out of that [ __ ] and cease to
10:19 become this kind of person what's
10:21 frustrating to me is you know there's a
10:24 lot of us trying to wake up in the
10:27 universe trying to find the folks that
10:30 are manipulating the population of this
10:33 planet and it takes some balls right it
10:39 takes some balls that take some
10:40 intelligence it takes a lot of
10:42 dedication you have to read things and
10:44 cross-reference things and if you read
10:47 both sides of an argument even though
10:50 you don't want the one that's kind of
10:51 trying to debunk your current thinking
10:54 and you work really really hard I know
10:57 that most of you listening or in this
10:58 camp then you you share your findings
11:03 with one of your
11:06 friends who's putting on that he's a big
11:08 badass and a guy turns into a big
11:12 [ __ ] [ __ ] right away and he starts
11:16 taking it he just writes blank checks to
11:20 terrorist organizations to military
11:22 industrial complexes to every single
11:25 entity that's involved that through
11:28 other smoking guns you know they're not
11:30 legit you know that they have a history
11:34 of doing things like this and you're
11:36 just trying to uncover the latest you
11:38 know murder mystery of what they're
11:41 doing and it's tantamount to take in the
11:44 situation on one level and reversing it
11:48 all the way back to the beginning just
11:49 kind of undoing it depending on the
11:52 setting of how these kind of escapism
11:55 things come out because that's what
11:57 they're trying to do they're trying to
11:58 escape the reality that something
12:01 negative is happening on their watch and
12:03 that they have to get off their lazy ass
12:04 and do something right let's talk about
12:09 what fuels this disorientation between
12:13 someone growing up as a child and having
12:15 no need to be anything you don't need to
12:17 be macho you don't need to be anything
12:19 you just be a nice kid right and then
12:21 getting to this point where they start
12:24 putting on this this cloak of deception
12:27 about who they really are and again they
12:29 did it to themselves first and then they
12:32 shared it with the world that's the way
12:34 it always works and they get false
12:37 alkaloids
12:38 it's like those [ __ ] guys that the
12:40 tattoo the Navy SEAL tried it on their
12:43 body and then they hang out at bars and
12:46 they get all these alkaloids for being a
12:48 badass when they haven't even enlisted
12:50 in the military you know they're usually
12:54 formidable guys but still they did not
12:57 become a Navy SEAL so it's a version of
13:01 that and they always have a ton of tales
13:04 about how badass they are that's the
13:06 only funny thing is that they they take
13:08 stories and they exaggerate the [ __ ] out
13:10 of them and they just retell them and
13:12 retell them and the idea is that what
13:15 they're saying is I wish I was Bruce
13:16 Willis and a fictional character right I
13:19 wish I was
13:20 you know Mel Gibson and in [ __ ] Mad
13:23 Max 1981 like they wish they were these
13:27 you know fabled fictional characters but
13:31 a coward is a cheat right the coward is
13:35 the person who subscribes to cheating
13:40 because you got to pay your dues to get
13:42 things in life right if you really want
13:43 to get them and so some point in their
13:47 youth telling a lie worked out for them
13:53 they told a little lie and someone gave
13:57 them something gave them respect perhaps
14:00 to give them some object in life but
14:02 probably disrespect and then that just
14:05 became the little tiny kernel that
14:07 rolled down the hill and turned into a
14:08 massive snowball and what's interesting
14:11 about it is that people get themselves
14:13 so wound up in their lies that they no
14:17 longer know what the [ __ ] truth is
14:19 until someone like me walks up to them
14:25 and says though you you know you think
14:28 you're you know you've said you're part
14:30 of our club guys that are real well we
14:35 got some [ __ ] that needs to get done
14:37 here come on let's go and the funny
14:41 thing is is right away they could tell
14:43 you've been there before this is like
14:47 the hundredth rodeo you've gone to and
14:49 what's funny about it is they've never
14:51 been to a rodeo but they've run their
14:53 [ __ ] mouth to the point that they
14:54 tell the [ __ ] planet they've done a
14:56 thousand rodeos with the big blubbering
15:00 [ __ ] and you can see it right away
15:03 that's what's funny even if they try to
15:05 say yes you're a mum in you immediately
15:08 know you can just [ __ ] smell it smell
15:11 the perfume coming off their dress and
15:15 you realize you got liability on your
15:16 hands now
15:19 for those that have been there there's
15:23 usually commonality with that group and
15:29 that is that none of us really said you
15:33 know we're trying to get involved with
15:35 this kind of stuff if you've had to deal
15:37 with some pretty tough situations it's
15:39 because you were forced into it and then
15:43 maybe you got good at it and then you
15:45 volunteered into it you a lot of times
15:49 will be forced into it as a kid for
15:52 reasons that have nothing to do with
15:53 your destiny or your life that helps you
15:57 develop skills for Manning up and
16:00 willing to make a sacrifice for what's
16:02 right in this world and you take that
16:04 darkness from your past someone forcing
16:07 stuff on you and you you do it for your
16:10 own reasons later on right and just an
16:13 example what I'm talking about is you
16:16 know you could be in a school system
16:18 like when I was a kid you don't hear the
16:21 new kid on the block constantly all
16:25 [ __ ] mangy douchebags come around try
16:28 to start fights with you right away and
16:30 so you got to fend all that [ __ ] off
16:33 usually the natives that are pretty well
16:36 rooted they don't mess with you they
16:37 just want to hang out so the kid you
16:40 might get forced into a lot of scuffles
16:43 and that just hardens you up but hardens
16:44 your soul of it lets you understand how
16:47 to stay calm in the middle of a
16:48 situation and then later on and you need
16:52 to man up and nut up to protect your
16:54 country well you've been here a couple
16:57 times right you go in the military you
17:00 get toys to play with you didn't have on
17:03 the playground but you know in the
17:06 waking up episode that I did in season
17:08 one it's all about that threshold of
17:10 pain and processing data and so we find
17:15 out something devious has happened in
17:17 the planet
17:18 it's not exactly the funnest thing to
17:19 think about you know in my experience
17:21 it's not that any all the guys want to
17:24 make sure the women don't have to deal
17:25 with this [ __ ] that's the truth it's for
17:28 you ladies to deal with it hats off to
17:30 you it's not that you're not equally
17:32 capable of doing it we just don't want
17:33 you to have to deal with it the men are
17:35 supposed to [ __ ] build the perfect
17:36 world and protect you just in case one
17:39 of the apples goes bad
17:42 so don't think that we're trying to
17:45 minimize your contribution you've got
17:47 kids to raise if that's what you want to
17:48 do and build a beautiful family and
17:50 since we come home with all the nicks
17:52 and scratches from being a war we'll
17:54 just need little kisses on those things
17:56 right but for men demand there's no
18:00 goddamn excuse in my opinion I don't
18:01 give a [ __ ] if you're some little
18:03 scrawny guy or you're some six foot
18:06 eight blubbering idiot I don't care
18:08 you're if you're alive and you're a male
18:11 you got [ __ ] beans and Franks between
18:13 your legs I don't give a [ __ ] if you
18:15 identify the [ __ ] sofa I don't
18:17 [ __ ] care if you got those bits
18:19 between your legs
18:20 you're expected to [ __ ] man up and
18:24 participate I don't care if you talk
18:28 like a woman I don't care this is our
18:32 responsibility our genetic
18:33 responsibility but what's funny for me
18:36 is that we can find a [ __ ] smoking
18:38 gun in this world and I can give it to
18:43 some people I know and they just turn
18:45 into the biggest [ __ ] cowards you
18:50 know they could be in the grassy knoll
18:52 in 1963 the day that Kennedy is
18:55 assassinated they could be standing
18:57 behind the gunman pointing a [ __ ]
18:59 sniper rifle at JFK they hear the pop
19:02 they see his head explode the cloud from
19:04 the [ __ ] rifle goes up and right into
19:06 their nostrils and they could smell it
19:08 they could say hi well you know hey I'll
19:10 see you later he loves good shot see you
19:12 later and then later on say well maybe
19:16 it was just an exercise maybe it wasn't
19:21 what I thought I saw because they're
19:22 [ __ ] cowards you know I feel like
19:26 that's how a lot of this [ __ ] happens in
19:28 the world is you have [ __ ] cowards
19:29 everywhere they see the crime they know
19:32 exactly who did it but no to save their
19:35 own bacon in their own brain
19:36 they let evil perpetuate right and then
19:42 one day the Nazis come for them and
19:45 there's no one left and the to add
19:48 insult to injury in my opinion it's the
19:54 these [ __ ] cowards want to sit and go
19:56 to public places and whine and [ __ ]
19:58 about how the world works about how it's
20:01 all an affair we have to sit and listen
20:06 to it and instead of enjoying our
20:09 evening and maybe watch a little bit of
20:11 television and sharing what's happening
20:13 today we got to listen to this whiny
20:14 [ __ ] sit there and [ __ ] complain
20:16 about the world offering no solutions to
20:20 anything or listening to their grandiose
20:23 if I was the bishop that was me I'd
20:25 [ __ ] be goddamn Rambo and Superman
20:28 [ __ ] combined and as soon as they're
20:31 out of that theater of exhibitionism
20:35 it's right back to [ __ ] ville now when
20:39 the world is good you can tell a big
20:42 tall tale tell everyone how you caught
20:44 the 400-pound salmon you can say how you
20:49 saw a UFO you can be the great frisbee
20:51 out of the Twilight Zone episode tell
20:53 tall tales because it doesn't matter
20:55 life is good you're just entertaining
20:57 we're enjoying your imagination about
21:00 how amazing you are that's fine but when
21:03 the world needs a few souls to step up
21:06 to the plate it's no longer funny to
21:09 pretend to be a soldier to pretend to be
21:12 a man because we really need those now
21:17 and right now what we're fighting is an
21:21 information war right I think a stroke
21:25 of the biggest stroke of genius for Alex
21:27 Jones is calling his website info
21:29 wars.com right now you know I don't
21:34 validate I don't know what to think of
21:36 that guy anymore split that way I have
21:38 nothing negative to say nothing positive
21:39 to say but he concerns me I think that
21:43 guy at least puts his money where his
21:45 mouth is if it came right down to it
21:48 Alex Jones would be at the forefront of
21:51 any battle battlefield I need go right
21:54 out with the rest of the soldiers I
21:56 truly believe that so hats off to that
21:58 guy but right now what is going to
22:01 change the world's information in our
22:03 brains transferring between wires over
22:06 YouTube over why
22:07 there's over podcasts through emails
22:10 through text messages through [ __ ]
22:12 through a picture picture is worth a
22:16 thousand words well apparently some
22:19 people again they could they could see
22:22 anything and they'll either think it's
22:24 CG if they don't want to believe it or
22:28 they get some stage thing and we have
22:30 plenty of dis info now that's using
22:32 computerized graphics to create fake
22:34 events so it's really tough right then
22:38 you have the people that are sitting
22:39 around waiting to be offended because
22:41 they use that as a little crutch to
22:45 never have to deal with [ __ ] reality
22:48 luckily I don't know too many these
22:50 people but you see them right sometimes
22:55 they will take their race their
22:58 bloodlines and if they don't want to
23:00 deal with the conversation they will
23:02 arbitrarily throw out bizarre self
23:04 accusations of their race I mean you
23:06 could be talking about a bunch of white
23:07 guys and some doodles say well it must
23:11 be my races fault and you're looking at
23:12 them going I was are you [ __ ] talking
23:14 about your race dude we're not even
23:17 having a race conversation here but
23:19 they'll throw that out there so they can
23:22 just you know it's like the flamboyant
23:26 male that throws themselves into a room
23:27 and some really intense outrageous way
23:30 just to get a [ __ ] a bunch of
23:34 sympathy all of a sudden it's just
23:39 reprehensible behavior in a public forum
23:42 in my opinion and what's really
23:45 interesting without getting into
23:46 tremendous specifics but there's a few
23:48 of you they're going to know exactly
23:49 what I'm talking about there's a big
23:52 movement I'm going to say in Los Angeles
23:54 area which is a big area which is Los
23:56 Angeles and all the surrounding counties
24:00 people starting to wake up and I can
24:02 only assume this is starting to happen
24:03 around the world but people are starting
24:05 to wake up to the notion that there are
24:09 giant parts of history that are complete
24:11 [ __ ] lies and I mean famous eras in
24:16 history that we're raised as kids that
24:19 there are institutions the goal
24:21 I'm saying that it happened this way and
24:22 there's no other way there's laws on the
24:24 books and say you can't [ __ ] question
24:26 this era of history but I'm telling you
24:30 right now it's crumbling at an alarming
24:32 rate those [ __ ] lies are falling down
24:34 at a huge rate but there are people who
24:38 have been rewarded for this history
24:43 they've always been able to walk in a
24:46 room and use this little part of history
24:49 to get a big [ __ ] sympathy card I
24:52 want to free this I want to free that I
24:55 want you to tell me how you like me so
24:56 I'm going to mention this how a
24:58 situation that I wasn't even [ __ ]
25:00 alive for is the reason why I get
25:03 sympathy from you for the rest of my
25:05 [ __ ] life like Native Americans walk
25:06 in and go hey you killed all my [ __ ]
25:08 ancestors but we don't even see that in
25:11 America they're probably ones that
25:12 [ __ ] deserve it right but when it
25:15 comes to you know Manning up and being
25:18 able to siphon you know some decipher
25:20 the data to siphon through all the facts
25:22 that are coming out or I should say
25:25 cleaned facts and be able to just look
25:27 at it objectively it's nearly impossible
25:30 to study the [ __ ] facts of half these
25:34 [ __ ] because they're just a bunch of
25:36 [ __ ] [ __ ] and it's super
25:40 aggravating you're like aren't we adults
25:41 here yeah well then what the [ __ ] is
25:44 your problem
25:44 well I'd still feel comfortable with
25:46 this oh why because it shatters the the
25:51 mechanism by which you have [ __ ]
25:53 stolen sympathy out of societies around
25:55 the [ __ ] world you don't have any any
26:00 self [ __ ] worth to say that I don't
26:03 want to be a goddamn chump I don't want
26:06 to mean you know if somebody said that
26:09 you got a key to the town because your
26:12 grandfather lied about creating some
26:16 invention and it gave your whole family
26:18 line a key to New York City now you're
26:20 walking around with the key you can get
26:21 a bunch of [ __ ] for free in New York and
26:23 it's all based on a [ __ ] lie and your
26:26 family just keeps passing this lie all
26:27 the way down so you can have this
26:28 privilege at some point I hope that it's
26:32 somewhere out of someone's vagina is
26:34 [ __ ]
26:35 hatched a person with a goddamn bit of
26:37 you know self-respect and says the buck
26:42 stops here I will no longer take a
26:44 reward that's not meant for me it's all
26:47 based on a [ __ ] lie
26:50 it's not that my family is a bunch of
26:52 bad people were a bunch of good people
26:53 but that one event that happened way
26:56 back then doesn't have anything to do
26:57 with anyone in our family line least of
26:59 all the [ __ ] that took the reward in
27:01 the first place but then you have a
27:04 bunch you have this other thing that
27:05 happens in life which is [ __ ] unite
27:11 bunch of these guys they end up hanging
27:13 out with each other after a while a
27:15 bunch of people who lie about everything
27:18 that they've ever [ __ ] done and they
27:21 all stick together so that way they can
27:23 tell the tall tales stories and pretend
27:25 how badass they are with each other
27:28 this happens everywhere happens as a kid
27:30 happens in your below ten your teenage
27:33 years your 20s or 30s your 40s in here
27:35 you have to make a choice what you're
27:37 going to surround yourself with because
27:39 it will infect you
27:40 you will begin to sensationalize your
27:43 own past women don't do this this was so
27:48 cool about shakes they don't they don't
27:51 need to tell that story I mean there was
27:53 never a joke when I was a kid about how
27:55 a woman lied about baking a cake that's
27:57 ten stories high but there's always the
27:59 funny joke about a guy lying about
28:01 bigger fishes because I guess the
28:05 genetic trigger there is that we want to
28:06 we have to impress our female in order
28:10 to to get sex or something right
28:13 in my travels what's interesting is the
28:16 people that really did do everything
28:17 that they say it's almost impossible to
28:20 find out that they've done it you could
28:23 be sitting right next to a war hero that
28:27 did you know hacksaw ridge that guy you
28:30 sit right next to the guy and you could
28:32 talk to him about life you could talk to
28:35 him for hours and hours about life and
28:36 you won you won't find out that he ever
28:38 enlisted in the military and you won't
28:40 find out that he saves 70 guys on a
28:43 ridge because they have integrity
28:48 but the liar can't wait to [ __ ] and tell
28:51 you how amazing they are because what
28:55 happens is is that the fabric of their
28:56 being is based on a bunch of lies and if
28:58 they do not save the lied and the
29:02 scaffolding that holds up their fake
29:04 [ __ ] image crumbles and so they
29:07 rushed from one conversation to another
29:09 to another until one of these guys walks
29:13 in is tired of the [ __ ] we're tired
29:16 of the lies the beating the wise old
29:20 souls that we are we know we're not just
29:22 going to walk up and accuse them of
29:23 being a liar because we understand we're
29:26 dealing with an overgrown child and
29:29 what's funny is we also know that when
29:31 you start confronting these cowards you
29:34 might get a physical reaction out of
29:35 them because they realize that the jig
29:38 is up and they really don't want the jig
29:41 to be up right so you just start
29:44 triangulating their conversation you do
29:48 what we call in psychiatric care a
29:52 reflection session first thing we do is
29:56 we reflect back everything that they
29:58 said that they they've accomplished
30:00 starting to create kind of an image a
30:02 structure of logic and because it's very
30:06 apparent that they're lying and they're
30:07 boasting you start to talk about the
30:12 missing pieces in the story and you try
30:16 to get them to explain the missing
30:17 pieces very quickly since they haven't
30:21 really experienced any of that [ __ ] we
30:24 haven't really done any of it they tell
30:28 bad lies you know if it was truly a
30:32 scaffolding analogy you know the lies
30:35 tend to come in now have fairly
30:36 fortified beams of steel but the problem
30:39 is is they need more beams before the
30:41 whole thing is going to stand up and the
30:42 light comes in made of bamboo right it's
30:46 just flimsy it's not well-thought-out no
30:48 one's ever challenged them before which
30:50 is why they continue to tell the lie and
30:52 you make them crumble right in front of
30:55 your very face
30:58 there's a great example of this in the
31:01 movie Unforgiven with Clint Eastwood
31:05 Morgan Freedman and this kid those of
31:09 you haven't seen the movie a young kid
31:10 goes and solicits Clint Eastwood's
31:13 character because Clint Eastwood's
31:14 character has a past it's just real it's
31:18 all fictional of course but the kid says
31:21 he's killed a bunch of people and then
31:23 he needs to kill this guy who kind of a
31:25 prostitutes face big reward out he said
31:30 will you help me and you know is okay
31:32 I'll I'll help you out but my buddy's
31:34 got to come which is Morgan Freeman's
31:35 character and they ride with this kid
31:37 for a while when they find he's blind
31:39 I mean he's not blind blind but he can't
31:41 see far away he's very nearsighted
31:43 and second the more that he talks about
31:46 having killed people it doesn't seem
31:50 like he you know what he took away from
31:53 killing a person was not what you take
31:56 away from killing a person his
31:59 descriptions are like comic book
32:01 episodes right and when he finally does
32:04 kill a guy he gives the whole thing up
32:10 because in the end he wasn't who he said
32:12 he had built himself up to be right and
32:15 what's interesting in this day and age
32:18 is that we don't have those scenarios
32:21 you know we're not looking to start any
32:22 physical war with anybody we kind of
32:25 more intellectual you become the more
32:27 informed that you become we have a very
32:32 good chance of solving all of our
32:33 problems in this planet through policy
32:35 changes now Europe whose let a bunch of
32:37 sanctuary cities form they're going to
32:40 have to have physical extraction it's
32:43 going to be a big United Airlines
32:44 extraction for those [ __ ] but as long
32:48 as America can keep these from appearing
32:50 in the United States of America we have
32:54 a good chance of just talking and
32:56 keeping physical confrontation wherever
32:58 happening
32:59 so what's interesting about that is that
33:01 we have created because we have at least
33:04 in this country no impending invasion
33:07 happening at this moment
33:11 these cowards get to live another day as
33:14 a coward they get to enable the negative
33:19 forces of the universe by writing them
33:22 blank checks constantly and again what
33:26 the most frustrating part of the whole
33:28 game is that they want to show up to a
33:32 rugby game and talk [ __ ] about how easy
33:35 it is to play rugby
33:36 they want to stand on the sidelines they
33:38 even want to you know be the ball boy or
33:42 whatever the [ __ ] it is and they want to
33:44 pretend like they're in the
33:45 second-string lineup of the team but the
33:50 second to coach says okay mr. tough guy
33:52 gets your [ __ ] ass out there grab the
33:55 ball and go up against a real rugby
33:58 player
33:59 oh all of a sudden they got a cramp in
34:02 their leg and all of a sudden you know
34:04 my you know my mommy's calling me and I
34:06 gotta go and that's the goddamn problem
34:10 because this ain't a rugby game this is
34:12 real [ __ ] life this is [ __ ] that
34:14 needs to change in the universe right
34:16 and every single time a guy writes a
34:19 blank check for a real situation that
34:22 needs to be dealt with on a mature level
34:24 they infect their pusseh fide friends
34:27 with the same thing or there's even
34:30 someone coming in who would be willing
34:32 to fight we wanted to take this
34:34 challenge on and I mean get the
34:36 information and pass it around and
34:37 investigate it because that guy's a
34:41 coward they he convinced them he
34:45 convinces them through a single
34:46 statement that it's nothing and then the
34:51 research ends so how do you know when
34:54 someone's really a coward I mean those
34:58 there there are examples like the rugby
35:00 thing that would be very apparent to
35:02 anyone watching right it instantaneously
35:05 no now of course there is an inverse
35:08 problem that I should probably just
35:09 mention real quickly which is you have
35:11 the gung-ho person who is always willing
35:13 to fight who's always going to get out
35:15 there and it's a knee-jerk reaction
35:16 without any research to go off and get
35:19 crazy and ruin the world in a bad way
35:22 right
35:23 they could still be good people it's
35:25 just they're very impressionable and
35:27 they just don't need a lot of
35:28 information but how do you know how do
35:31 you know someone's a coward in my
35:35 opinion there shouldn't be a man on
35:37 earth that is incapable of doing
35:38 research in any category of anything and
35:42 it doesn't mean that that some
35:44 information is going to be really really
35:46 tough to ingest unpleasant scarring even
35:52 but think about it I'm just going to
35:55 give you a very vivid example and I'm
35:57 going to give you a fictitious scenario
36:00 where it was portrayed on television
36:03 there was a series called true detective
36:06 and Woody Harrelson and Matthew
36:12 McConaughey right playing two detectives
36:15 it's it's ass one season long had its
36:19 own story in the second season had a
36:20 completely different story and I think
36:22 it sucked miserably so I didn't really
36:24 watch more than a couple of those of the
36:25 second season but the first season was
36:28 about two cops that were busting a child
36:31 trafficking cult in the south kind of
36:37 Louisiana bayou type area it's
36:40 masterfully written it's masterfully
36:42 acted and quite frankly the you know
36:44 Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson
36:46 were cousins
36:47 honestly they should have had Emmys for
36:49 this they didn't get him
36:51 it was unbelievably well done but it
36:55 came down to a point where they had a
36:58 videotape a videotape of some politician
37:04 yes having sex with a child a girl and I
37:08 think that there was even a maybe a
37:12 murder involved with that I can't
37:13 remember exactly the details but these
37:16 two detectives had to watch this video
37:18 and it was so horrifying as they
37:20 portrayed it in the fictional story that
37:23 it destroyed both of them now they kept
37:28 going but I mean when I say destroyed
37:30 for that moment of their life it was
37:34 really shitty
37:35 and this that because this kind of thing
37:37 is happening every single day we know
37:39 that child pedophilia happens all around
37:40 the world we know child trafficking
37:42 happens around the world right so who's
37:45 going to stop them a bunch of [ __ ]
37:47 cowards because there's two types of men
37:50 in this world there's the guys says not
37:52 on my watch you know I'm never going to
37:53 do anything phony if something happens
37:55 on my watch I'm just going to run away
37:57 they don't say that out loud of course
37:59 they're a big badass hit the [ __ ]
38:01 smoke lines they're a badass at their
38:03 [ __ ] gun range they're going to do
38:05 this they're going to do that oh there's
38:08 any risk to their own [ __ ] life well
38:09 no way man I got so much to live for you
38:12 know many [ __ ] tall tales I got to
38:13 tell still and then there's those of us
38:16 that simply say look I don't give a [ __ ]
38:17 what it takes I'm not going to be an
38:19 idiot about it you know I don't want to
38:20 walk right into the lion's den like a
38:22 [ __ ] but I'll burn the [ __ ] place
38:24 down I'll spread the information
38:27 regardless if it makes me look like a
38:30 weirdo or not it doesn't matter
38:33 and again we want to protect our ladies
38:35 from this kind of information they
38:40 shouldn't have to live this kind of
38:41 world and yeah you know some women will
38:43 be very dizzy and weird because they
38:46 never they don't have any clue that the
38:48 world is so dark just consider that a
38:51 bit of a blessing and one way you can
38:54 see that as mission accomplished your
38:57 kids going to be in the chair too
38:59 because they don't know the world is
39:01 crappy you have a boy well you're going
39:04 to have to initiate them into the
39:05 situation depending on what's going to
39:07 be likely their future
39:09 you know I've recorded an episode called
39:12 being a man three times and every time I
39:17 listen to it it's too disorganized
39:18 and I just thought it was [ __ ] I don't
39:21 know that I'll ever get it worked out
39:23 but I would say this is as close to that
39:25 episode as it should be you know we're
39:28 born genetically a particular way right
39:30 there's some [ __ ] down between our legs
39:32 and that's what determines what you are
39:33 in terms of just you know your
39:35 orientation where you identify well
39:36 there's five genders that I think I
39:39 might you know endorse but if your man
39:44 tell us even if you're a lesbian and you
39:47 want to come over and do this
39:49 job believe me you're welcome to the
39:53 club because you could out [ __ ] man
39:56 half the [ __ ] guys I know we've got
39:59 to toughen up this is a systemic problem
40:02 coward ism is a systemic problem by men
40:05 being raised by cowards
40:11 sometimes the fathers are so dominant
40:13 the kids the the sons become cowering
40:17 sons because they've always been scared
40:20 of dad you know dads has been a [ __ ]
40:23 crazy dude and you know plenty of guys
40:25 er I've got some friends of monitor
40:27 raised by alcoholic fathers and they
40:29 were very abusive and of course they
40:31 don't want to be anything like their
40:33 parents because their fathers because
40:35 that wasn't a good combination but
40:38 what's the biggest bummer the biggest
40:40 bummer is that we don't have any manuals
40:45 on how to raise kids and I tell you what
40:49 if raising your sons to have some
40:50 [ __ ] balls was ever taught you'd have
40:54 the military-industrial complex and a
40:56 bunch of [ __ ] bankers try to make
40:58 that illegal it is your duty as a man to
41:01 protect this [ __ ] planet it is your
41:04 duty to not be a coward as a man females
41:10 you know I would hope that you would be
41:14 able to take this and you know what the
41:17 woman that I know that listen to this
41:19 show or anything but cowards they're
41:22 anything but women look the other way in
41:26 the face of truth so I think we are
41:29 those guys that watch the show and those
41:32 supposed to make it I think we're very
41:34 privileged to have company of some
41:37 really great women in our circle and
41:42 that's not a suck-up and that's the real
41:44 deal but a lot of you ladies are forced
41:47 to raise sons by yourself and so I would
41:52 say you know what we don't do in my
41:55 circle of life we don't talk about the
41:57 word cowardice we don't
42:01 and I can tell you from being a little
42:03 kid when I was I have told the story in
42:05 season one when I was a little kid about
42:07 nine years old my mom just going to just
42:11 on a 100 mile trip
42:14 she told me you know finish what you
42:16 start and if that becomes a tough
42:20 obstacle for you then be careful what
42:23 you start so you know to finish
42:24 something that you would rather not have
42:26 started
42:27 she said finish what you start because
42:29 if you do that even if it's something
42:32 you didn't want to do I mean we're not
42:35 talking about crimes or self-mutilation
42:37 you'll learn something and she was a
42:41 thousand percent correct but she told me
42:42 at the age of nine and just that tiny
42:46 phrase from my mom which the
42:48 conversation may have lasted five to ten
42:50 minutes tops it changed my life it
42:53 became my work ethic you know probably
42:58 at some levels that became my sort of a
43:02 compulsive disorder you know at some
43:04 points in my life but you know I've
43:06 learned to obviously balance that out
43:07 for at least the last thirty years of my
43:09 life but even that little bit of
43:11 compulsiveness through my teenage years
43:12 it was everything and anytime I didn't
43:16 finish something I really regretted it
43:19 you know I've got some beautiful
43:21 paintings that I've done but I still
43:24 have in my house you know 95% of them
43:26 are done but I've got a couple of them I
43:28 painted the the front album covered a
43:30 purple rain and I got prints photo-real
43:33 and a lot of the environment around his
43:35 motorcycle the motorcycles photo-real
43:37 but I didn't finish all of the outer
43:40 externals of the of the album but the
43:42 last time my paintbrush touched his
43:44 eyeball get it perfect to put the little
43:47 tiny sheen on the tip of his eyeball I
43:51 was 16 years old and so now when I look
43:55 about look at it you know trying to
43:56 touch it in my 40s it just would not be
43:59 fair that is a time capsule from 16
44:02 years old and it's actually a time
44:03 capsule of of sort of Perpetual were
44:06 regret that I didn't finish that one
44:08 thing now because I got him right on the
44:11 bike perfectly I feel pretty good about
44:13 it but
44:15 the whole thing was a challenge to
44:17 myself to see if I could do it I'd never
44:18 done anything so complex in my life so
44:21 what I learned was that I can do
44:23 anything I put my mind to but now the
44:26 game is way way beyond acrylic paint on
44:29 a canvas right there's a video going
44:33 around of a group I think their name is
44:35 like white thunder or something like
44:36 that there's this group of folks that
44:38 are all ex-military and they're coming
44:41 out and they're realizing that wars are
44:43 created by bankers and it's you know
44:49 these kids are just fodder in the cannon
44:52 they get dismembered that have their
44:55 lifes destroyed by war and just because
44:59 there's a few metals that you can get
45:00 for fighting for banks it still
45:03 convinces folks that it's worth it again
45:06 it's the dagger of goodwill they carve a
45:09 dagger out of all of your goodwill of
45:11 your patriotism and then they stab you
45:16 with it and more you come home and with
45:20 some medical condition that they're
45:22 going to blaming on ALS let's just all
45:24 those WMD vaccinations that they inject
45:28 you with it makes you go [ __ ] batshit
45:30 crazy but you out there D you deserts
45:32 where you're sucking up a bunch of
45:34 radioactive isotopes and you have joint
45:36 pains to the rest your life which again
45:37 they're going to blame on something that
45:39 will keep them from being legally liable
45:41 liable for it they're going to blame it
45:43 on your genetic line because then it was
45:45 always part of your family and it's not
45:47 the military's fault that you have
45:49 shitty genetics but they don't have
45:51 shitty genetics if anything they've got
45:53 superior genetics they just got duped
45:55 like I said in the episode you know
45:58 being offended here in season two I
46:01 guess this might end up in season three
46:04 these cowards also use being offended as
46:07 a technique of defending their cowardice
46:11 they sit in the conversation you know
46:13 and and someone who's lying about who
46:15 they are as a person especially to
46:17 themselves and other people it's it's
46:19 the old metaphor painting yourself into
46:21 a corner because eventually they're
46:23 going to meet someone like me who
46:26 doesn't lie about anything
46:28 and we're going to have a conversation
46:33 because they're going to try to join the
46:35 club
46:36 the man club and all they're going to do
46:39 is they're going to put on you know
46:40 external behaviors that put them in that
46:43 man category trying to get into the club
46:46 I mean literally being a man is a club
46:49 and you know what on the inside is a
46:51 little rough and we all have different
46:55 duties because we have different talents
46:57 right you might have you might be a
47:01 strategic person that figures out how to
47:03 organize the forces to go do something
47:06 you might be the muscle guy you might be
47:09 the geek whatever every single role that
47:15 you can play in the game of life is a
47:17 valuable role you don't have to get in
47:20 some goddamn fistfight to be a man but
47:23 you got to stand for something right if
47:26 you don't stand for something you stand
47:27 for nothing that's the old saying and
47:29 that's the goddamn truth and that's why
47:32 I made the morality episode I think we
47:35 all be very surprised at how simple it
47:38 is to become an integral human being to
47:41 society it's actually very easy you know
47:44 there are there countless books written
47:49 perhaps a hundred years ago about
47:52 individuals that were trying to satiate
47:56 the rite of passage right they were
47:59 trying to determine am I a man yet and
48:04 as easy as that sounds sometimes it
48:07 ain't that easy to prove it to yourself
48:09 and that's why you know quote-unquote
48:14 primitive cultures have these rite of
48:16 passages moments right stick your hand
48:18 in a and a glove made of bullet ants you
48:21 know stand on a [ __ ] totem pole for
48:24 ten days you know whatever it is go kill
48:26 a lion or participate in the group task
48:29 of killing a lion
48:30 perhaps you're supposed to throw the
48:31 death blow perhaps you're supposed to
48:33 clean the animal whatever it is a lot of
48:35 cultures have figured out these
48:37 definitive moments in time you know the
48:39 Jewish people have Bar Mitzvahs
48:41 I think are fantastic because it is it
48:43 is if you've ever seen one they really
48:45 are a powerful mental moment for the
48:47 Jewish culture to tell their sons you
48:49 are now entering manhood and you have
48:52 responsibilities and you have principles
48:54 and you have integrity that you must
48:55 uphold as a Jewish person well you can
49:00 get confirmed in a Catholic Church and
49:02 they don't see [ __ ]
49:03 oh yeah there's all the commandments
49:05 you're not supposed to do but [ __ ] we've
49:07 already boiled those away by the time or
49:09 15 years old and to hear someone mention
49:10 them again it's just like in one ear out
49:12 the other one of the greatest things you
49:15 can you can gain out of being raised in
49:16 the Midwest is that you don't have the
49:19 giant city a pop culture putting all
49:22 this crap on you to distract you when
49:26 you drive between one town in another
49:28 town there's actually something called
49:29 country you're not in town anymore
49:33 you're not in any city limits you're in
49:35 country and so it's quiet and it's
49:38 focused and it's inish and it's
49:39 meditative to be out there you have a
49:42 lot of time to think to your think for
49:45 yourself to yourself and hopefully by
49:49 having elders from that area but they
49:51 have seen it all
49:52 if they didn't go to war themselves
49:54 personally they've got family members
49:56 who have and they will pass down the
49:58 true wisdom from those moments the part
50:01 that's [ __ ] and the part that's real
50:03 you know and you'll find out that
50:05 becoming a man isn't and getting rid of
50:08 your cowardice isn't necessarily a
50:12 switch that you flick and all of a
50:14 sudden you have some balls and all of a
50:16 sudden you know you're willing to draw
50:19 that line in the sand and say this is a
50:22 very fair line in the sand this is so
50:27 clear that no one should cross that line
50:29 with me with my people with my family
50:33 with my friends and no matter how hard
50:36 it is to enforce that line you will to
50:41 the best of your ability hey we all get
50:42 our asses kicked every once in a while
50:44 we do try the most valuable thing you
50:46 can have happen to get your ass kicked
50:48 and physically or mentally it's as long
50:51 as you don't
50:52 you know fight it and you accept the
50:55 fact you were defeated it's an amazing
50:57 experience to figure out where your
51:00 mortality lies you'll also figure out
51:03 how to not get your ass kicked the
51:04 second time either by avoiding the
51:06 circumstance becoming better at fighting
51:09 I'm going to tell you right now if you
51:11 know anyone who's a coward or if you
51:13 suspect you've behaved in these manners
51:15 recently there's nothing more
51:18 invigorating than flushing that from
51:20 your system there's nothing more
51:24 invigorating than saying you know what
51:25 I'm going to cease becoming a tall tale
51:29 and I'm going to become a real person
51:34 with real integrity it will make you
51:38 feel proud of yourself and you know it
51:43 doesn't have to be fighting World War 3
51:45 it could just be stop [ __ ] lying have
51:50 the balls to study information that you
51:52 have never allowed yourself to study
51:54 before now back to the ladies for one
51:59 second here as I'm telling you this this
52:04 episode as it occurs to me I'm looking
52:09 back on my timeline of growing up in the
52:10 Midwest and to you ladies out there and
52:13 I think that the ones that watch the
52:15 show are exactly the kind of females
52:17 that I was raised by and with there was
52:21 no
52:24 I would say : I'm going to say it this
52:26 way there was no lack of utter courage
52:29 and integrity in the females that raised
52:31 me I'm going to suggest that the females
52:36 that make up my hometown at least when I
52:40 was a kid especially my grandparents and
52:42 what have you they were more dedicated
52:46 and found it more easy to be who they
52:48 really were and to maintain those
52:50 principles of integrity and thus totally
52:54 avoid being a coward than perhaps the
52:57 males were and I would bet I would wager
53:02 that if you asked most of the men in my
53:05 hometown I would say that are 70 and
53:08 older which obviously they're
53:09 disappearing off the planet that they'd
53:11 probably tell you it was their spouse
53:13 that helped them maintain their
53:15 integrity because there's not in my
53:21 experience there's not a lot of
53:22 nonsensical pressure on a woman to
53:24 behave in a boisterous way women again
53:29 are not expected to go to the lake and
53:31 pull out the biggest catfish but the men
53:34 are so the men feel that pressure to
53:37 come back to the lodge the the club or
53:39 the restaurant the bar and tell a tall
53:42 tale because that's what they're
53:43 supposed to have complex and they
53:46 probably have more in common with
53:47 someone by saying you know I [ __ ]
53:49 tried that Jesus I caught this I don't
53:52 know must have been a you know six pound
53:54 you know I hooked this six pound fish it
53:57 jumped out of the water and flew you
53:58 know gloriously in front of me and I was
54:00 like oh my god it's the best catch of my
54:02 life and it got away and everybody else
54:04 in the room would say you know what
54:06 that's happened to me a hell of a lot
54:07 more than catching the fish so I know
54:10 exactly how you feel there's more
54:11 camaraderie with that a little bit of
54:13 humiliation than it is to tell the tale
54:15 that you caught the big fish and oh you
54:17 already skinned it and ate it which is
54:19 why you can't show anybody if oh man my
54:21 camera didn't work so I mean you know
54:22 that kind of [ __ ] right the Francis
54:26 Bacon I think one doth protest too much
54:31 the more you run your mouth about all
54:32 these amazing things that you've done
54:34 I'll tell you if you meet me I'm going
54:36 to think that's exactly the opposite of
54:38 what
54:38 you've accomplished in your life you
54:40 know I've said in several episodes
54:41 rebuilding the pyramid from the bottom
54:43 up and obviously I've kind of I've also
54:46 said that that it's robbing out a great
54:48 metaphor because we don't want to
54:49 capstone to the pyramid anywhere we
54:51 don't want to build pyramids in terms of
54:53 how to run society but I will say
54:54 whatever whatever physical model appeals
54:56 to you in terms of envisioning the power
54:58 structure in this world you know there's
55:01 a reason why we don't build houses out
55:04 of popsicle sticks because they're not
55:08 strong if every guy could build their
55:12 house out of either gigantic you know
55:15 fossilized [ __ ] trees or big I beams
55:18 we would because to us we want to have a
55:21 shelter that never falls down a goddamn
55:24 hurricane could hit the house our
55:26 tornado could hit the house ain't
55:28 nothing gonna shake it earthquake could
55:30 happen and the house just kind of shrugs
55:32 it off right that's what we would do so
55:37 why would we want to build society out
55:39 of a bunch of flimsy ass human beings we
55:42 know that the male's of this world are
55:44 being a feminized to being a feminized
55:46 with estrogen mimickers you know which
55:49 is you eat certain foods a lot of GMO
55:52 foods and it mimics estrogen and a man
55:54 and so it puts a Phi's the man it just
55:59 does the ladies if you want to marry a
56:02 man and you have a man be your husband
56:05 and raise your kids strong then you need
56:08 to be against you know estrogen
56:10 mimickers as well when you help the
56:13 family choose what food to eat you got
56:16 to put your foot down and say we're not
56:18 eating this [ __ ] cuz I don't want a
56:20 goddamn husband running around in my
56:21 [ __ ] dress while I'm gone and when
56:25 there's a noise in the middle of the
56:26 night I don't have to worry about who's
56:28 going to kick that guy's ass solve the
56:31 problem I want to get pregnant I don't
56:34 want to regret carrying your [ __ ]
56:36 genes in me but every effeminate male
56:39 that comes out they win they being
56:46 you'll see the vehm episode which has
56:48 actually been watched quite a bit but
56:50 they're the one
56:51 that get to push us around right who's
56:55 going to who's going to fight back
56:58 when there's no more males there's no
57:00 more men and all the men that are here
57:03 well you split them right down the
57:04 goddamn middle if you're lucky and half
57:06 of them are cowards and half of them are
57:08 ready to rumble again we have a very
57:13 coveted moment in time right now to win
57:16 every single dispute in this world and
57:18 we turn it back to its luster of do no
57:21 harm fairness with our mouths and our
57:25 minds but if we keep going decade after
57:29 decade letting cowards
57:34 contribute to the blank cheque writing
57:37 write every [ __ ] thing that happens
57:39 in the world they've got some pusseh
57:41 fight excuse why it's not the way it is
57:43 right I said I run and tell you how we
57:46 did go to the moon you know when these
57:48 false Flags happen man they just get out
57:50 their pin and write excuse after excuse
57:53 after excuse you could have smoking gun
57:55 videos smoking gun picture doesn't
57:57 [ __ ] matter
57:58 these [ __ ] cowards get in there and
57:59 they write everyone blank checks make it
58:03 in the world suck just a little bit more
58:05 second to second right I know you feel
58:08 me there's a lot of videos on YouTube
58:11 about sort of the effects of coward ISM
58:16 right but they usually come out at very
58:18 icy and very sharp I'm not sure that I
58:21 have personally seen something that is
58:23 systemic the black pigeon guy he's
58:28 amazing he gets the closest to this sort
58:31 of dialogue but he runs really short
58:33 very powerful videos I think his website
58:36 is black spit black pigeon speaks calm I
58:39 think he's worth a listen you want to
58:43 test your your constitution and you're a
58:47 guy look in the mirror make sure you're
58:50 comfortable who you are audit everything
58:53 that you say on a daily basis tall tales
58:55 that you've told your whole life because
58:57 you invented them when you were a child
58:59 and you just haven't found the reason to
59:01 stop telling them we've all done this as
59:03 a kid
59:05 you know sometimes your memory betrays
59:09 you and you'll have memories that you
59:12 you develop as a child some that
59:14 sometimes a dream could meld with
59:16 reality as a kid again I've shared the
59:20 one that I had as a child where I
59:22 dreamed so vividly that I saw a UFO in
59:25 my little town of Derby Kansas it's not
59:28 my hometown but it's one time I lived in
59:30 for three years and it was a broad
59:32 daylight observation I was like dusky
59:34 kind of early evening and I you know I
59:37 can still see it right now I can see it
59:39 like it happened yesterday and it was
59:42 this crazy thing and I all these people
59:44 in the town we're looking at it from
59:46 where I was and I was on my bicycle at
59:49 the time following it but all these
59:50 people were there just like it really
59:52 happened and I now have to assume that
59:58 that obviously didn't occur because that
60:00 would have been in the newspapers it
60:01 would be this recorded moment in history
60:03 they would have put the Phoenix lights
60:04 to shame I dream that and then I told
60:08 some of my friends at the time probably
60:10 not realizing that it was complete
60:12 horseshit and then I stamped it in my
60:14 brain as truth but I was wrong I was a
60:19 kid enjoying the big eyes from my friend
60:22 saying oh my god you really did see that
60:24 I'm like oh yeah totally so you might
60:27 have those kind of infantile things that
60:29 happen to you but when you're an adult
60:33 when you're an adult and you're making
60:35 new lucid records of your history
60:40 there's no excuse no excuse at all
60:45 that's it hopefully you found this
60:49 inspiring hopefully this will help you
60:54 segregate those around you into a group
60:58 and for those friends of yours that are
61:01 still struggling with this you know it
61:05 depends on what your patience pool is
61:07 I'm losing patience with all this
61:10 [ __ ] I don't really want to spend my
61:12 time around people who basically talked
61:15 and concentrated lies
61:18 constantly and allies just simply
61:22 portraying themselves to someone that
61:24 they're not they're interested in the
61:26 drama negativity but they're not
61:30 interested in taking that ability to
61:32 process negativity and put it into
61:35 actually doing research and figuring how
61:36 the world works
61:38 they've got religious paradigms they
61:40 crawl into they've got you know racial
61:43 paradigms they crawl into to be victims
61:45 to make sure that the conversation at
61:48 any point in time is halted right you
61:52 get a little too real with them boy
61:53 they're going to [ __ ] throw their
61:54 [ __ ] out there let's not be those
61:58 people okay let's be kind and
62:01 considerate let's not get emotional
62:03 about everything that's wrong let's just
62:07 sit down and talk about things to be
62:10 fair with the evidence could be true
62:12 could be false if you don't have proof
62:14 it'd turn out to slam down those
62:18 potential possibilities in any absolute
62:22 without proof one way or the other deep
62:27 thoughts radio.com for all the feeds if
