00:00 [Music]
00:32 welcome back ladies gentlemen the deep
00:34 thoughts today we're going to talk about
00:38 chemtrails again I made an episode in
00:40 season one that's entitled our
00:42 chemtrails real and what I'm going to do
00:45 in this particular episode is edit
00:46 together some of my personal photographs
00:49 of chemtrails to show you why they are
00:52 very real so if you're coming in on
00:55 audio and this is something that
00:57 interests you then please get over to
00:58 youtube and just search on deep thoughts
01:00 radio and you'll see my ugly mug and I
01:05 wear sunglasses just in case it's in
01:07 black and white if you haven't been over
01:08 ever
01:09 I watched a live broadcast from someone
01:14 I admire and it was sort of shocking to
01:20 see that this person had started off
01:23 understanding a lot of things about the
01:26 world and that it would seem that they
01:28 have completely gone down the path of
01:30 joining them so that he doesn't have to
01:33 wake up in the morning with any
01:35 imperative in his life and it is it's
01:42 saddening to me I've got an episode I
01:44 recorded which I don't know if it's
01:45 going to be out it's a season 3 thing I
01:47 keep in season 3 looking pretty much
01:49 like season 2 I'm gonna redo this intro
01:51 so I haven't even gotten to the point
01:54 I've done the redone the intro or
01:55 anything again I'm going to swap the
01:58 music at least but he went on and on and
02:01 on about how anyone who believes that a
02:03 lot of things in life are conspiratorial
02:09 meaning you know one or two people
02:11 conspiring against
02:13 others he essentially just sat on this
02:17 live broadcast and just one by one told
02:20 the world that there are no conspiracies
02:22 in the world and nothing to worry about
02:24 and there's a lot of them like get
02:29 behind him a little bit on but
02:32 kentrell's is one that I thought was
02:34 shockingly in his portfolio and then the
02:40 funny thing is he'll say you know I have
02:42 been researching this for four years and
02:45 therefore I completely [ __ ] know what
02:47 these things are and I've done this in
02:49 that nough searching this for you know I
02:56 would say researching and taking
02:58 photographs and interviewing pilots for
03:01 nine years at no point did anyone ever
03:06 shake up my belief that these things are
03:08 real and now we actually have the
03:10 director of the CIA we have NASA and we
03:13 have other organizations all coming out
03:15 saying that a geoengineering program is
03:18 being launched it is now starting and
03:20 it's going to be raining this reflective
03:22 shield in the sky to bounce back the
03:24 sunlight to help fight global warming so
03:27 that's in the press today national
03:30 normal press okay not fake news press I
03:33 mean they're all [ __ ] fake but
03:34 whatever and so you know we've had the
03:37 government of Germany admit that they
03:40 have an aerosol program they said it was
03:42 an experimental military weapon I have
03:47 lots of friends in China who are
03:49 indigenous Chinese people and domestic
03:51 American expats that live over there for
03:53 manufacturing reasons they have said
03:57 look we've watched you know Chinese
03:58 government is admitted manipulating the
04:00 weather for the Olympics which created a
04:02 monsoon that killed like 75 people which
04:05 probably means about 750 and so what
04:09 blows my mind is that anyone would ever
04:11 say that an aerosol program doesn't
04:13 exist when it's been completely
04:14 Declassified when geo engineers meet at
04:19 conferences and discuss the entire
04:21 application and use of these plus the
04:23 chemical compounds that are being
04:25 sprayed out of these
04:26 that we have you know picked up out of
04:29 the sky now what might be [ __ ] our
04:32 spin-off theories like Morgellons who
04:35 knows right we will be talking about
04:37 that on this episode so before we
04:40 totally go into all the photographs I
04:42 just want to say a little bit of the
04:44 metaphysics of why people cowered down
04:46 if you feel hopeless and incapable of
04:50 actually imposing change on the areas of
04:56 the world that you can't control right
04:58 if someone said your water supply is
04:59 fluoridated you should get fluoride out
05:01 of your water a couple hundred bucks and
05:03 your kitchen is secure for the rest of
05:05 you know for ten thousand gallons you
05:07 know you can just keep replacing the
05:08 filter you can put them in your showers
05:10 you can put them on the main line of
05:11 your house you can clean up the water as
05:13 frustrating as that is you still have
05:15 the mechanism to make it better if
05:17 someone proves to you how bad
05:18 pharmaceuticals are and GMO foods and
05:21 fast foods and all that stuff you can
05:23 simply stop eating it and stop taking
05:25 the vaccinations and stop going to the
05:26 hospital get murdered by an oncologist
05:28 straight okay but this guy is a very
05:32 special thing that we cannot easily
05:34 control dr. Russell Blaylock has taken
05:38 samples of this stuff being spread out
05:39 the back of planes and it's nano sized
05:41 machine made versions of aluminum barium
05:44 oxide strontium which is an isotope
05:48 straight out of a nuclear reactor and
05:50 again the the strontium could be picked
05:53 up by the atmosphere if things like
05:55 Fukushima are real if things like
05:58 Chernobyl are real the stuff gets just
06:00 pushed in the sky and when you grab
06:02 stuff out of the sky you're simply
06:03 grabbing minut amounts of stuff that's
06:05 been put up there right so I understand
06:10 if someone is they look in the mirror
06:13 and they go look I'm willing to do
06:15 anything to make the world a safer place
06:16 for myself for my wife for my children
06:19 with my husband or whatever and when it
06:22 comes to the sky being polluted what the
06:24 [ __ ] can you do you know you buy a bunch
06:26 of JDAM rockets and you know what is a
06:30 the tow missile whatever thing you can
06:33 shoot off your shoulders it knocks
06:34 planes out the [ __ ] sky you can't do
06:36 that
06:37 so you have to either stay inside when
06:39 it's happening or figure out a way that
06:43 through exposure of the conspiracy that
06:46 we get the world to wake up and say no
06:48 more planes are allowed in the sky if
06:50 they can't fly from point A to point B
06:51 without creating some sort of trail it's
06:54 it's more indicative of a contrail right
06:58 but what happens when conspiracy gets
07:01 revealed well initially the the
07:05 government agency that's doing it which
07:07 could be deep state could be some sort
07:09 of shadow government which is the same
07:11 thing they're doing it through some
07:14 weird lie that gets the government to do
07:16 it to themselves right most of our stuff
07:19 I believe comes out of San Bernardino or
07:20 San Diego I live in Huntington Beach so
07:23 when I see all of the trails coming out
07:25 of the desert over Orange County they're
07:27 all vectored back to San Bernardino
07:29 which is a very very heavily protected
07:31 base I've got family that have worked at
07:34 that base and you know again you get in
07:37 a black bus and you're [ __ ] driven
07:39 around for 30 minutes to try to
07:41 obfuscate where you are you get a bunch
07:43 of turns and stuff you can't figure out
07:44 where you are it's a different path
07:45 every day and there's a lot of secrecy
07:48 up there for some reason so where does
07:52 someone draw the line between they're
07:54 real and they're not real because as
07:57 soon as a conspiracy is revealed the for
08:02 lack of a better agent see chief
08:05 agencies the Army Corps psyops they have
08:07 over a billion dollars a year in funding
08:09 I think it's nearly 2 billion now and
08:11 they have a bunch of spin-off consulting
08:13 agencies that also contribute to PR
08:16 spending dreaming up ideas to to dilute
08:21 the evidence so that you can't find it
08:23 to give people who are going into the
08:24 cowardice phase of their life all these
08:26 scientific explanations as to why this
08:28 occurs all of a sudden now the problem
08:33 is is that if you are in your late 20s
08:36 or early 30s and below age wise that you
08:40 will know nothing else besides
08:41 chemtrails you will think the planes
08:44 make clouds that that you know this
08:48 chemical condensation between
08:50 temperatures
08:51 creates a nice trail behind the plane
08:52 somehow expands and creates a natural
08:55 seeding that makes clouds the vapor is
09:00 cloud that take on no hue of gray
09:02 because they do not absorb they're not
09:04 made of moisture for one thing and they
09:05 reflect light like a mother so the pure
09:08 white crystal bags of stuff floating in
09:11 the sky again Los Angeles California in
09:14 Orange County and Ventura County are
09:15 very intense targets for this because we
09:18 have a massive population around here it
09:20 also happens in the Midwest of my own
09:22 town right I've also tracked this on a
09:26 GMO Monsanto level in my hometown where
09:29 for 150 years my hometown was able to
09:32 grow soybeans and corn infinitely and
09:35 hay and if we don't do wheat in my
09:38 hometown that weeps further east our
09:40 further west excuse me in Kansas we're
09:42 on the southeast corner and it they
09:44 sprayed the [ __ ] out of my hometown all
09:46 the crops failed for four years straight
09:48 and Monsanto showed up with an aluminum
09:51 oxide resistant plant and all of a
09:55 sudden everyone had a really amazing
09:57 crop and they got to spray glyphosate
09:59 which is round up all over the crops
10:02 which then soaks into the [ __ ] food
10:04 which think it's distributed to the
10:05 world and now not only are you eating a
10:07 GMO terminated gene sequence but you're
10:10 eating glyphosate I was back from my
10:14 reunion a few years back it was pathetic
10:20 there was a whole Armada of jets flying
10:22 this grid over my hometown it's like we
10:24 don't have any International Airport
10:26 near my town my town is a hundred miles
10:29 away from the nearest domestic or
10:31 international airport I should have said
10:33 domestic so no one flies over my
10:35 hometown ever never has but now they fly
10:39 between ten thousand feet and twenty
10:41 thousand feet I mean the planes are
10:43 massive in the sky dumping this [ __ ] out
10:45 but they think that everyone from the
10:47 Midwest is so stupid they can get really
10:49 blatant like they used to do in
10:51 California my concern is that they have
10:54 found a way to apply so much pressure
10:56 that good soldiers of the world are
11:00 caving in and joining them you know it's
11:04 one thing for you to say
11:05 in your living room and go yeah but
11:06 maybe these things aren't what they say
11:08 they are baby Jesse Ventura is big giant
11:10 vagina is right that there's no reason
11:13 to fight back because you know if these
11:14 things were real then they would spray
11:16 him over Washington DC they wouldn't
11:17 spray him over all the politicians
11:19 because why would the politicians allow
11:21 us to happen it's like what politician
11:23 besides Trump is not a massive [ __ ]
11:25 [ __ ] you mean to tell me that Obama
11:28 gave you any [ __ ] inkling that he was
11:31 a man he let country after country
11:34 threaten us and he just kept moving the
11:36 line back you know Bush wasn't any
11:39 better so we need some grown-ups in this
11:43 [ __ ] world
11:44 we don't cower down you can take a break
11:48 all you want but if you sit at your
11:51 house and you start joining them or you
11:53 start you know just saying man I can't
11:55 figure out what the [ __ ] these things
11:56 are you know what's a Faraday in Tesla
11:59 both knew that ether existed and they
12:01 both gave up on trying to figure out
12:03 exactly what it was but they didn't
12:04 subtract it from their [ __ ] equations
12:06 Tesla's whole thing was based on
12:09 something that he couldn't figure out
12:10 what it was but he said it's there so at
12:14 a minimum you need to hang on to logic
12:16 and understand that just because you can
12:20 quote scientific process had read it out
12:22 of some [ __ ] Wikipedia page and feel
12:25 smart if you don't apply it to your life
12:27 and the problems of this world and
12:29 you're just blowing smoke up your ass
12:31 you're [ __ ] Neil deGrasse Tyson 2.0
12:34 and you're useless to humanity so there
12:40 used to be another show called MKULTRA
12:41 radio it's gone now but during that
12:44 particular show My partner and I Kyle we
12:47 went out and and my co-host I should say
12:50 I gotta be careful using the word
12:51 partner in this world my co-host we
12:53 conducted its many interviews as we
12:57 possibly could with pilots with anywhere
12:59 from a few thousand hours of experience
13:02 to 20,000 hours experience we
13:04 interviewed commercial pilots private
13:06 pilots and military pilots unequivocally
13:10 they said it's not us man it's not our
13:14 flights our flights do not make these
13:16 [ __ ] things as a matter of fact
13:18 one of them talked to us about the fact
13:21 that they have to take a class in
13:22 aviation school that is directly related
13:25 to contrails and how they create and the
13:28 the gotchas with flying behind other
13:30 jets if it's a real high condensation
13:32 atmosphere upon that particular day
13:35 because it's really cold and he says
13:37 that no point in the educational process
13:39 of contrails did they ever [ __ ]
13:41 mention this latest invention of
13:44 persistent contrails so how do you
13:48 figure how do you figure with all the
13:51 education from the 80s clear up into the
13:53 21st century control training never ever
13:57 talked about persistent contrails they
14:00 don't need to tell you something that
14:01 your plane never does right one of the
14:04 pilots I interviewed is about 10,000
14:08 hours and he said when I was really
14:09 young I started flying he says I would
14:11 one of the events that really took place
14:13 in his life was that he pointed over to
14:15 a plane that was shooting at railway
14:17 below them he goes we're at 35,000 feet
14:19 and this thing's at like 20 and it's
14:21 shooting this [ __ ] trail and I said
14:23 hey he's a co-pilot he goes what he
14:25 what's that and he's flying in a normal
14:27 commercial jet as a co-pilot and he said
14:30 that the pilot he was his 40s or
14:33 whatever maybe early 50s said you know
14:35 we don't talk about those planes oh
14:39 because they don't exist right mm-hmm
14:43 later on about ten years later as he's
14:46 flying a g5 back from South America he
14:49 has a plane that he can see in the sky
14:51 that is getting really close to his
14:55 plane and it's seemingly has this suit
15:00 coming out the back and it's so intense
15:02 you can see it at nighttime because
15:04 there's the moon was out I was flashing
15:05 on all the clouds from above and he
15:08 could see it and he calls down to ground
15:10 control and says I got this plane off to
15:13 my right and it's not showing up on my
15:14 radar
15:15 there's no Friend or Foe indicator what
15:17 is this thing no reply back from ground
15:19 control the plane turns off its lights
15:21 because uh you know speeds up and goes
15:23 about hundred I guess aeronautical miles
15:26 ahead of them and then it it as he is
15:30 the Justice vector to land at the air
15:32 port here in Los Angeles he gets behind
15:34 the thing he gets a callback that simply
15:37 says the following he's out of your way
15:39 now the lights had come back on and now
15:41 they're flying in the week of the trail
15:43 because it changed altitudes and he's
15:46 coming down for the landing so they're
15:47 kind of crossing each other's paths he'd
15:50 never seen anything like it in his life
15:51 at no point is he ever has he ever flown
15:54 in the path of a smoke trail coming out
15:57 of a plane never even seen it besides a
15:59 couple times you mentioned it to his
16:01 superiors who then told him to shut up
16:04 and let's keep track of how the
16:05 conversation went because I didn't
16:07 recall that for you guys in this episode
16:09 I never mentioned contrails or
16:12 chemtrails excuse me to him before I had
16:15 him deduce that that's what was going on
16:17 so I didn't feed his brain with the
16:21 concept and have him repeat it back as a
16:23 matter of fact he had never heard of the
16:26 theory of chemtrails he had just seen
16:28 these things and wondered what the hell
16:30 they were and the funny thing was even
16:32 after the interview which lasted an hour
16:34 he didn't really seem to have any
16:37 interest in looking at it but then again
16:39 you know he may have metabolized an
16:41 interest over time the fighter pilots a
16:45 retired fire fighter pilot that my my
16:47 co-host interviewed just kept saying
16:50 over and over and over again they exist
16:52 but they're not us they're not anything
16:55 commercial they're not us the other
17:00 commercial pilot that had $20,000 and it
17:03 was just about to retire he said the
17:05 same thing and it was interesting these
17:07 two people don't know each other but
17:09 both of them said it's not us isn't that
17:12 remarkable
17:13 so I think I'm going to tireless
17:17 chemtrails are real when I used to take
17:21 photographs of chemtrails it started in
17:23 2008 and what's very fascinating about
17:25 this is that if you started in 2008 you
17:29 saw the evolution on how these things
17:31 are sprayed it used to be really blatant
17:34 and I'm going to start showing some
17:36 photographs of my my neighborhood here
17:38 as it was gridded back in the day
17:42 absolutely gridded
17:44 they still shoot massive lines from time
17:46 to time but again with all these [ __ ]
17:48 coming out saying it doesn't exist they
17:50 can go back to these blatant techniques
17:52 because the disinformation is now
17:56 infiltrated people that were fighting
17:58 the war to get rid of these things right
18:01 and now they're like hey stupidity is
18:04 multiplying we've got evangelists for
18:08 the [ __ ] you know death of mankind
18:10 isn't this great
18:12 but now they spray in special techniques
18:15 they even spray multiple planes side by
18:17 side to create big giant blankets of
18:20 this stuff the trail almost combines
18:22 immediately right the buddy of mine is a
18:26 former flight attendant I took him out
18:29 on a day we just happen to walk out of
18:30 his house on a day here in Orange County
18:32 and the sky was [ __ ] plastered with
18:35 these things but it's all coming back
18:36 you know coming in from a vector over in
18:38 San Bernadino base and I looked at him a
18:41 night because he's not he doesn't fall
18:44 conspiracies at all and he knows that
18:45 I've talked about chemtrails a little
18:47 bit he's been and you know thousands and
18:48 thousands of flights in his lifetime and
18:50 I said look at those trails right there
18:52 I said does that match the the you know
18:55 the highways up there does this look
18:57 anything like the landing path of the
19:01 NIDA bases or sorry to the airports as
19:03 you know up because we got John Wayne to
19:04 the south we got Long Beach to the north
19:07 and 30 minutes north you've got lax I
19:09 said if all planes create these things
19:11 on a particular day because the
19:12 weather's a certain way then every plane
19:16 should be doing it and we should just
19:17 see the corridors up there in the in the
19:19 sky it should be literally look like a
19:21 teiko race car set in space right right
19:26 above our head but it's not that way on
19:29 days that this [ __ ] happens just stand
19:33 out there for 30 minutes to an hour and
19:35 keep looking for everything that's
19:36 flying over your head and the funny
19:38 thing is is that a bunch of planes will
19:40 be at varying altitudes so you just take
19:42 your camera and/or take your eyeballs
19:44 it's better if you have a zoom camera
19:46 and you'll notice that the size of the
19:48 plane determines its its altitude
19:52 I know fine planes exactly the same size
19:55 as other planes that are that aren't
19:56 farting out a single contrails particle
19:58 let alone these persistent contrails
20:01 right because I'm surrounded 10 minutes
20:05 to myself fact assignment net like eight
20:07 minutes to the south I got John Wayne
20:09 Airport about ten minutes to my north I
20:12 have long beach
20:13 I got long beach flights that fly over
20:14 and land for those of you listen to the
20:16 show you're for 200 episodes every time
20:18 you hear a flight flying over not a
20:20 helicopter but a flight it's going to
20:23 Long Beach and so I've got a corridor
20:25 right over my house
20:26 boom boom boom so the day that
20:29 everything is all packed up there I've
20:32 got planes coming in all day long and
20:34 they circle out there in the ocean and
20:36 come in a lot of them and some planes
20:40 are dumping out and the funny thing is
20:42 is like I've got photographs of c-130s
20:44 dumping out for massive trails out of
20:46 one point unbelievably massive trails
20:50 coming on the back of these planes it's
20:52 summertime the ocean itself is 75 to 80
20:56 degrees the water which takes a lot of
20:59 heat and I guarantee you when it's a
21:00 hundred degrees outside the thermals up
21:02 there are much warmer than they are in
21:05 the wintertime and if the sky will fill
21:07 up on a particular day but again plane
21:10 after plane flies by these trails and
21:14 they're not cranking out anything the
21:18 other thing is when you grow up in the
21:20 Midwest planes and jets are very
21:22 mysterious and especially in the 70s and
21:24 80s when I grew up there every time I
21:27 saw a jet fly over this is a big deal as
21:29 a kid you'd point use low heat stare and
21:31 you always see the little contrail in
21:33 the middle of the winter which is this
21:35 little tiny trail behind the plane and
21:38 when I went back for my reunion in the
21:39 middle of summer when the kid it was
21:41 100-plus degrees out every single day I
21:43 was there this guy is filling up with
21:45 these low altitude planes and why do I
21:48 know they're low altitude well they're
21:49 shitload bigger than the ones that are
21:51 cruising over at 30,000 feet because I'm
21:54 sitting there and there was a thirty
21:56 thousand foot er up there putting out a
21:58 little trail little tiny contrail and
22:00 these other things they're big giant
22:02 thick cotton clouds right these things
22:04 that are being sprayed out of these
22:06 chemtrail planes and that it can only be
22:09 achieved through low altitude to look so
22:12 massive in the sky right but now here's
22:15 where we get to the point where we can
22:17 start cutting through the [ __ ] of
22:18 them being fake or real how many's
22:21 photos to prove us to you
22:23 chemtrails fly in very intelligent
22:26 patterns when they are spraying the
22:29 stuff on us they are spraying it in
22:31 geometric shapes and there's a lot of
22:35 theories about why they do this but one
22:36 thing that they do is they will shoot a
22:38 line in the sky and you know again your
22:41 your person doesn't want to believe your
22:43 joiner of the dark side they'll say see
22:46 that's just a this is the persistent
22:48 contrails
22:49 then another plane flies up against that
22:52 trail and turns off the sprayer they fly
22:55 a trails directly to a perpendicular and
22:57 turn off their sprayer and continue
22:58 flying so now you have a tea in the sky
23:02 that is not going to happen that is not
23:06 going to happen if it's an organic thing
23:08 that's happening simply because of the
23:10 conditions in the atmosphere we've got
23:14 tea will be called tea bars we've got
23:16 Z's where two lines are sprayed and
23:19 someone comes in between and turns on
23:21 the sprayer when they hit the first bar
23:22 and turns off the sprayer when you hit
23:24 the second bar we have people that are
23:28 planes that turn off their sprayers and
23:30 did flight and they are hard stops
23:34 they're going to see a photograph as a
23:35 hard stop just right over my foot my
23:37 house and it's a square on the end it's
23:41 not a tapered you know hey I went inside
23:45 up a pocket of moisture and I created
23:47 this trail and then I'll said I'm out of
23:48 the pocket of moisture now and it's
23:50 super super low to the ground the other
23:53 huge thing is that when I Easter on my
23:58 old video game company I had several
24:00 employees coming to work every day both
24:03 I had a North office in a South office
24:06 and at one point we got up to about 30
24:08 employees about a third of them here in
24:11 Orange County and 2/3 of them up in LA
24:13 and I was obsessed with taking
24:17 photographs of these things I've got
24:18 thousands and thousands of photographs
24:20 and when I finally got my 50x zoom with
24:22 the 50x digital zoom
24:24 I was able to start taking photographs
24:26 of planes you know and getting the
24:28 pictures of their vertical stabilizers
24:31 and I would come inside
24:35 because it when you get into this you
24:38 get infuriated pretty quickly if you're
24:41 new to this right and that's why people
24:43 cowered down and join this dark movement
24:46 because it is infuriating because you
24:48 can't control your air very easily what
24:50 I'm gonna do put an oxygen scrubber
24:53 inside your house so that all the oxygen
24:55 guns in your house is like some nuclear
24:57 fallout shelter no you know what what
25:01 happens here is that they spray on a
25:03 particular day fill up the sky
25:06 unbelievable and again doesn't match any
25:08 of the flight corridors of commercial
25:10 flights
25:11 I believe I've got photographs of what
25:15 looks like a Southwest Airlines light
25:17 doing it which they have the very
25:18 patented orange and kind of purplish
25:21 blue paint job and but there's no
25:24 markings on the back like it's a taxicab
25:26 that's still yellow but they've painted
25:28 out you know yellow cabs logos it's like
25:30 an old cop car where they it's like the
25:32 Blues Brothers cop car where they've
25:34 painted out all of the you know police
25:36 enforcement logos but you can buy the
25:39 car with this the base coloring right
25:42 but what happens is my I would come
25:45 inside there was a point where I would
25:47 sort of mention these to my employees
25:50 are it's a happy chemtrail day when I
25:51 walk in the door and they would laugh
25:54 and I told him I said you know make sure
25:58 you take your vitamins make sure you eat
26:01 right because everyone's going to get
26:02 sick in this office about three days
26:04 from now two to three days from now and
26:06 they laugh two to three days later both
26:10 my North office and South office would
26:12 come down with massive colds flus
26:15 whatever is going around right and I'm
26:18 sitting back on Jesus Christ you know
26:20 how many
26:20 times that I got to predict they're
26:21 going to get all sick at the same
26:22 [ __ ] time before they just sort of go
26:26 what are you are you the guy bring into
26:28 some you know pathogen into the office
26:29 or something or is it coming from
26:32 somewhere else
26:32 but I wouldn't tell them every single
26:34 time so like I'm programming their
26:36 brains to get sick but it always
26:40 happened like I've said several times on
26:43 the show I've got friends in mind in
26:45 Hollywood that contribute heavily to all
26:49 things from the television and a lot of
26:51 them are Hermits they don't go out and
26:54 what I mean they don't go out they buy
26:55 all their food they stay in their house
26:57 they go in their backyard they mess
26:59 around they have their hobbies they
27:01 don't take walks they don't go down to
27:03 restaurants and eat they don't let
27:05 anyone come to the door besides maybe a
27:06 UPS guy dropping off a package and they
27:09 come down with the exact same ailments
27:13 as everyone else the other huge
27:16 indicated that these things are being
27:18 done intentionally and this is what one
27:20 of my interviews revealed was that
27:23 because one of the pilots had actually
27:25 been watching this for a long time and I
27:27 think he was he was very relieved to
27:29 have a conversation with someone for the
27:30 first time in his life where he could
27:32 just talk about it and he wasn't being
27:34 treated like he was a crazy person but
27:36 he said he was the one that really
27:38 locked down for me personally that these
27:40 things are being shot between 10 and
27:41 20,000 feet because he said look when
27:44 we're approaching our cruising altitude
27:46 he goes we have to go through these
27:47 things because I know specifically where
27:51 that zone is and then he said he goes
27:53 look pretty much between 10,000 and
27:55 30,000 some restricted military airspace
27:58 you know like the biplanes are all or
28:01 sorry or you know prop engine planes are
28:03 all down below that and you know private
28:05 jets go up to 40,000 45,000 feet but the
28:09 one thing that he stressed that he
28:13 argued with I guess with some of his
28:14 co-pilots over the years was that they
28:18 seemed across the same airspace within
28:21 seconds which allows them to shoot these
28:24 T's where there's one line that goes
28:27 over the other or they should these
28:29 figure at A's in the sky big giant
28:33 letter A's
28:34 and he said it's it's not permitted to
28:37 do that because it's not safe you can't
28:40 share airspace like that because some
28:42 idiot is going to run into another plane
28:43 you can't have close calls and not and
28:47 get away with it basically every time
28:48 the plane gets close to another plane in
28:50 the sky it's typically harvested and
28:52 reported and then the news every once
28:54 awhile when news is slow pick it up and
28:56 report a near-collision
28:58 and the sky right again I'll repeat the
29:02 fan experience I'll try to find the
29:03 photographs but I was filming a group of
29:06 planes that was coming out of San Diego
29:07 flying up the coast of LA dropping these
29:10 massive trails I mean massive trails
29:12 meaning probably a good hundred to 200
29:17 mile long trails and then I kept filming
29:20 them going from south to north south to
29:22 north and our coast is actually diagonal
29:24 so it goes in a direction kind of goes
29:26 from south east north west and then I'm
29:29 filming you know I'm taking these
29:31 photographs and then all of a sudden a
29:33 the same plane with the same markings on
29:36 the back that it flown up earlier was
29:37 coming back south along the border I
29:40 would assume to go back to where it came
29:41 from and it had no trail while it's
29:43 cousin with the same exact weird
29:45 markings on the back was cutting a
29:47 massive trail and again for your people
29:50 who cowered down and try to whitewash
29:53 this whole thing that doesn't make any
29:55 sense if the atmosphere is creating this
29:57 condition it will create that condition
29:59 for every single plane that has a heated
30:01 turbine it really doesn't matter what
30:04 fuel use right anytime something gains a
30:08 certain speed it has friction and the
30:15 faster it moves the more friction that
30:17 happens right it's very difficult to
30:21 shoot out you know cold air right that's
30:24 why we have air conditioners right we
30:26 have to metabolize the air so it's
30:28 SuperDuper cold air source and it's
30:30 heating up the whole way as it goes out
30:32 but a turbine is always hot as hell now
30:37 I want to say that in trying to uncover
30:41 the conspiracy of chemtrails there
30:46 we inadvertently probably created some
30:49 some untrue facts about when they
30:53 started and it has to do with the fact
30:56 that when society when a section of
30:58 society wakes up to conspiracy they will
31:02 typically record that the conspiracy
31:04 started when they personally woke up and
31:07 it's it's part of what keeps people up
31:10 at night when they wake up to how the
31:11 world is actually being manipulated by
31:13 all the banking institutions and
31:15 obviously their subsidiary corporations
31:17 and military industrial complexes right
31:19 because you wake up and you say oh my
31:22 god look how the military does this and
31:24 does that especially like not taking
31:26 care of our wounded soldiers that seems
31:29 like something has recently come out to
31:31 the you know in America as the VA s but
31:33 you go back in time and it has been
31:36 happening forever the second your
31:38 country has used you up as a soldier and
31:41 I mean all European countries America
31:43 they typically won't take care of the
31:46 vet they're done with you you you serve
31:49 the petrol dollar right luckily that's
31:54 changing in a huge way this year so the
31:57 back to chemtrails
31:59 the first group that really put millions
32:02 of dollars into researching this was the
32:05 group in Santa Fe that I mentioned in
32:07 the other episode a bunch of really
32:09 eccentric brilliant creative people who
32:12 can see things that other people can't
32:14 see because they're creative started you
32:17 know they're trying to paint the vistas
32:18 in New Mexico and there's this huge
32:22 Armada of plane spraying the desert and
32:25 you would only assume it's a test
32:27 because what the hell could they be
32:28 doing they can't really affect much of
32:29 the population and they can't they're
32:32 not really affecting any crops there's
32:34 nothing growing out there so it must've
32:35 just been messing around so they call
32:37 the Air Force and said look could you
32:39 guys lighten up a little bit because
32:41 we're trying to we live out here and
32:43 we're trying to paint the vistas and you
32:45 guys are blotting out the Sun which
32:46 completely affects the color powder what
32:48 we're trying to do here
32:49 you know because you least let us know
32:51 when you're going to do these maneuvers
32:53 so we won't waste our time driving a
32:54 hundred miles out to a Vista
32:56 to paint gray and the airforce tell them
33:00 we're not doing anything those things
33:02 don't exist so at that point you have
33:05 you know military branch telling human
33:07 beings they're not seeing something that
33:09 they're seeing they have pictures up but
33:12 they were the first group that went up
33:13 and got samples of this stuff and that's
33:15 where you got the barium oxide aluminum
33:16 oxide and fibers with desiccated red
33:19 blood cells in them now again a bunch of
33:23 that could be although I've seen the
33:26 interviews with the guy that did this
33:27 and and you know everyone could be a
33:30 show everyone could be a liar you know
33:32 they want to create this big distrust of
33:34 government thing right but enough people
33:37 have gone up that are angry and paid for
33:40 research people contributed their time
33:44 to researching this stuff but what
33:46 happened was is that the the overall
33:48 story was that these things started in
33:50 the late 90s because that's when this
33:53 group who put a lot of effort into it
33:55 started noticing them and they said that
33:57 well a few years before living in New
34:00 Mexico they were always able to paint
34:01 the vistas without any any you know
34:05 significant visual interruption right
34:09 but now I've watched a bunch of movies
34:12 that actually have trails in them now
34:17 there's a rumor that I will not
34:19 substantiate but there's rumors that old
34:22 movies are having them inserted in them
34:23 because they've got a way to get because
34:25 everything's digitally transmitted now
34:27 for Netflix and that kind of thing or
34:28 they're able to repress DVDs and
34:30 remastered them and they're putting in
34:33 chemtrails I have not seen any
34:36 significant proof that that's the case
34:37 but I've said like I've said before we
34:40 have them what we have them inserted
34:42 into CG movies for kids and why the [ __ ]
34:45 would you do that the turbo snail movie
34:49 massive chemtrails in the first act the
34:51 lego movie massive chemtrails why would
34:57 you put them in there why would you put
35:00 them in there you have to understand
35:02 people you know I work with effect
35:08 studios and when we
35:10 if a director sits over an animator
35:12 shoulder and says put this in you
35:15 there's a somewhere the executive
35:17 producer is hearing the money
35:18 clink out of their account into the
35:21 special-effects Studios account so
35:23 everything you put in these films you
35:24 have to pay for and if it's not critical
35:27 to the story why the [ __ ] put it in
35:29 there because you're paying for it you
35:32 know it's not the most difficult thing
35:34 to do especially the turbos snail thing
35:36 there's these you know particle systems
35:38 as you know someone dials in and just
35:40 literally select this and it makes a
35:41 cloud thing pop out and so you can have
35:44 you know model a plane make a particle
35:46 system right at the back end of the
35:48 plane or at the engines or whatever and
35:50 they fly over it sure seems like
35:53 someone's trying to bring wish kids and
35:55 to taking these things are real but now
35:58 here's the funny one you look at most of
36:00 the productions of the BBC it's almost
36:03 as if there is a conscious effort by all
36:06 the cinematic directors the the
36:10 directors other side of the other
36:11 directors of the shows to film as much
36:15 chemtrail activity as possible and all
36:18 their episodes take all the comedies of
36:21 the BBC you know IT Crowd and a bunch of
36:26 these shows and there's chemtrails
36:28 packed in the sky it is unbelievable
36:32 Reno 911 here in America tons of trails
36:35 in the sky but go watch something like
36:38 keeping up appearances this is a BBC
36:40 show made in the late 80s early 90s
36:42 there's no chemtrails in the shots none
36:47 right now if you watch The Muppet movie
36:49 made 1979 as I said before in previous
36:52 episodes there's a scene where Fozzie
36:54 Bear and Kermit the Frog are headed to
36:56 California and they pass Big Bird
36:58 walking down the street on old country
37:01 road and there's a chem trail from coast
37:03 to coast from like one horizon to the
37:05 other massive I don't know if that's in
37:09 the original VHS tape from the early 80s
37:12 if you got that movie go back and watch
37:14 it for me
37:15 you got a kid's copy or something
37:17 I had a buddy money as a massive Muppet
37:20 fan and I said could you please watch
37:22 this back for me and see if it's in
37:23 there he didn't have an old copy anymore
37:27 three amigos directed by mr. John Landis
37:31 the opening credits are shot against the
37:34 desert as they're kind of walking and
37:36 riding in on these horses and the trails
37:38 are all on the sky in the back but it's
37:39 a desert where they do you know a lot of
37:42 military you know pilot training so when
37:45 you have a jet that's doing afterburners
37:47 you will get amazing trail out of the
37:49 back of a jet when it's engaging these
37:52 you know super high velocity states of
37:55 the engine right so I've seen them in
37:58 old movies the artist known as Prince
38:02 did an interview on the BT Black
38:05 Entertainment Network I guess is Black
38:10 Entertainment Television or something
38:12 like that
38:12 it's famous you look up Prince
38:14 chemtrails and you can watch him do an
38:17 interview where he talks about how when
38:20 he was in Minneapolis Minnesota these
38:22 chemtrails he got this from Dick Gregory
38:27 one of his advisors Nick's a little nuts
38:30 nowadays but about 10 15 years ago Dick
38:33 Gregory was actually pretty phenomenal
38:35 but I think he's been used as a tool to
38:38 disseminate information that wasn't true
38:40 but then he tries to undo what he did
38:42 but Prince said look when I was a kid
38:45 these trails would go spraying over our
38:47 neighborhood and he goes about 30
38:50 minutes later everyone you could just
38:51 hear the neighborhood's start arguing
38:53 and getting really angry at each other
38:55 and he goes people would just lose their
38:58 minds a little bit that was in the late
39:03 60s early 70s Prince was born in 1958 so
39:08 it takes it way back so let's talk about
39:11 the mainstream press that's talking
39:14 about geoengineering chemtrails
39:17 literally chemical trails that are going
39:18 to be sprayed in the sky they call it an
39:20 aerosol program to create a reflective
39:23 shield of particles that will reflect
39:25 the sun's light and keep us from
39:26 suffering from global warming
39:30 well for any of you have done your real
39:32 research on global warming you'll know
39:33 it's nothing more than a carbon taxation
39:35 population control problem right so they
39:40 want to create carbon taxation so it
39:41 cost too much to live and you will not
39:43 multiply it because you have to pay for
39:45 every child until they get to 18 and get
39:47 their own allocation so global warming
39:50 as the what is ahead meteorologists
39:53 professor at MIT 10 years ago said you
39:55 know the amount of co2 in the atmosphere
39:56 is point zero five four percent in the
39:59 greenhouse gas layer which means there's
40:02 no co2 at all it's infinitely nothing
40:06 five hundred and fortieth of a single
40:08 percent all right so what do you what
40:12 are you protecting us against so the
40:15 idea that the governments are now saying
40:17 we're going to be spraying this in the
40:19 sky to defend you against something
40:20 that's not a problem means they're
40:23 spraying something in this guy for a
40:25 different reason okay but okay let's say
40:29 that you and I start a little uh start a
40:34 little company where we're going to
40:35 service this objective of creating a
40:38 shield in the sky to protect the entire
40:41 [ __ ] planet from every ray of Sun
40:44 that comes down okay so let's do a
40:49 little bit of basic science shall we
40:51 before we really get into this [ __ ]
40:53 because again this is normal news right
40:57 what's the hottest part of the the world
41:00 the equator right and again in the
41:04 heliocentric model they say the
41:06 regardless of the tip and the rotation
41:08 you know even though the Sun is 93
41:10 million miles away
41:12 it's sunrays are actually hitting us
41:14 parallel and that they're big excuse
41:17 while the equator is hotter than the
41:18 north and the south is because somehow
41:20 the curvature of the earth focuses the
41:22 beams down and Fries the center of the
41:25 earth more dinner fries the north in the
41:27 south which is complete and utter
41:30 horseshit right but you would want to
41:34 spray the equator more than anything
41:36 else in the world right because that's
41:37 where it gets hottest but now I want you
41:40 to think about this
41:41 think about how teeny-tiny a human being
41:44 / a big jumbo jet is in the world how
41:48 big is it get the whole world 8,000
41:52 miles roughly in diameter right the
41:54 circumference is 24,000 miles around now
41:59 let's take that into a three-dimensional
42:00 sphere how many cubic miles do you think
42:04 are in the world's atmosphere I don't
42:08 have it on me right now but I'll tell
42:09 you what it's a fucktown of cubic miles
42:11 up there in the sky and the more that
42:14 you take elevation you're expanding
42:18 infinitesimally but you're expanding the
42:20 circumference and the cubic mile is even
42:22 more so if we were to create a contract
42:26 agency we've got a bunch of jets and you
42:28 know they're a bunch of derelict jets by
42:30 off the the old fleets from national you
42:33 know brands out there like United and
42:35 whatever after we beat everyone up and
42:37 drag them off the plane we've got to
42:41 take the entire interior of the plane
42:43 fill it with a bunch of patented aerosol
42:46 units which we have got photographs of
42:49 that has filed in the Patent Office
42:50 under military designations and we have
42:53 got to spray every single square mile of
42:57 the world completely around top to
43:01 bottom right constantly constantly
43:06 constantly constantly with something
43:09 that's going to be sublight it stays up
43:11 there in the sky which is where the
43:13 theory of the nano-sized aluminum oxide
43:15 comes into play when it's really really
43:17 tiny the idea is that you can get it
43:18 over certain levels of the atmosphere
43:19 and it'll stay up there mmm remember the
43:26 photographs of the big thick trails
43:28 really close to the ground
43:30 remember the testimony from the pilot
43:33 that says look I fly over these things
43:35 constantly I flew to Hawaii into a 2013
43:39 November below me I saw a chem trail
43:44 pretty much headed all the way to Hawaii
43:46 the wyan citizens are very pissed off
43:48 about this by the way but the point I'm
43:52 trying to make is that it is technically
43:54 impossible
43:55 to impact even if you're willing to fly
43:58 these things at 60,000 feet which is
43:59 where you would have to fly these things
44:02 to get the particles to sit way up there
44:04 in the atmosphere right it's technically
44:06 impossible to use the entire world's
44:09 fleet kick everyone off the planes
44:10 higher United click kick everyone off
44:12 the planes punch everyone to face and
44:14 you got every single plane that we've
44:15 ever built that can do high altitude
44:17 flying and fill them full of these
44:19 aerosol dispensing machines and put them
44:22 up there in the sky it is impossible to
44:24 impact the amount of sun rays that hit
44:27 this planet it's impossible
44:30 the second you spray it in my clump up
44:32 fall down it hits a rainstorm falls down
44:35 we're not spraying them that high right
44:37 these commercial airlines are not
44:39 supposed to go much past 40,000 feet
44:41 this guy they're not built to do it
44:45 alright so what's this [ __ ] about
44:49 them spraying but a big shield around
44:51 the earth it's technically impossible it
44:54 is so technically impossible that to
44:57 even mention that that's a theory or an
45:00 objective that mankind is going to do
45:01 you'd be it would be spraying a shield
45:05 around Earth and building a Dyson Sphere
45:08 around the universe around the solar
45:09 system that's about in the same category
45:11 of impossibility but the current state
45:14 of technology that we have today
45:17 why do geoengineering groups exist with
45:22 aerosol programs as the forefront of
45:25 their objectives right every research
45:27 branch of the universe of our side of
45:29 our world of the University has a focus
45:32 right their focus is in aerosol programs
45:36 the geoengineering part of it now the
45:40 other side of the coin of the
45:42 accusations of those that have
45:43 capitulated down is that somehow there
45:47 are folks out there that love
45:48 conspiracies and you know again if any
45:53 of you have ever been in like you know a
45:55 fist fight of some sort and you've also
45:59 had a wonderful experience where you're
46:01 just out you know surfing or whatever
46:04 and you have you catch a really good
46:05 wave the amount of dopamine and
46:07 adrenaline that dumps
46:09 to your system when you're riding a wave
46:10 that you know you're sitting in the
46:12 ocean you're totally stationary and then
46:15 when you hop on a wave you're going
46:17 seemingly 2530 miles an hour within a
46:20 second it's an amazing experience right
46:23 plus you're one with nature out there in
46:24 the ocean but if you get into some sort
46:28 of altercation with someone or you get
46:29 all wired up and you're screaming and
46:31 you're yelling and pushing around a
46:32 little bit and it's all over you have
46:34 that same dump of chemicals in your
46:36 system and supposedly okay the
46:40 accusation is that for anyone who hangs
46:42 on to the visual evidence in the sky
46:44 like today there's not a single [ __ ]
46:45 trail in the sky today right
46:47 yesterday packed same exact weather
46:51 tomorrow would be the same thing will
46:53 either be binary it's either completely
46:55 [ __ ] packed for the trails or there's
46:56 nothing there's nothing because they
46:58 sprayed the [ __ ] out of us yesterday I
47:01 guarantee you if it's a natural
47:02 phenomenon it ain't [ __ ] possible to
47:05 have the whole sky agree you know into
47:08 one it all the multiple layers and the
47:10 pockets the air pockets up there and the
47:11 cold not pockets up there the thermals
47:13 will come off land and the the cold
47:15 thermals that come off the ocean fact we
47:17 should be seeing nothing but contrails
47:19 or you know persistent contrails the
47:21 second they hit land because they're
47:23 hitting or maybe they're over the ocean
47:25 and they stop overlaying because it gets
47:27 warmer now there's no logic to it at all
47:29 either they spray or they don't spray
47:31 right but the idea is that some some of
47:34 us are sitting you're getting off on
47:35 this or we have such precious [ __ ]
47:39 egos that we have to we have to release
47:44 videos that have the trend keyword in
47:47 the title and what's funny about it is
47:49 the people that are accusing this should
47:52 of all being fake make video after video
47:54 after video using flat earth and other
47:59 [ __ ] conspiracies in every goddamn
48:01 title of every video because what
48:03 they're really trying to do is get a
48:04 bunch of friends online you know it's
48:07 like this for anyone who really believes
48:10 that these things exist because they've
48:11 done their research they've taken their
48:13 photographs they've applied some logic
48:14 they've done ground interviews with
48:16 people which I know a lot of people have
48:18 done this all these steps right and
48:20 they're never going to let go they're
48:21 never going to let go man
48:23 if you said you know you could flick a
48:26 switch on your wall and they disappear
48:27 forever
48:28 and you will no longer get any notoriety
48:30 from chemtrail photographs videos
48:33 episodes and when you flick that switch
48:36 everything you've ever done and
48:38 everything you've ever gained from
48:40 talking about chemtrails goes away all
48:43 of us would go no [ __ ] problem flip
48:46 we don't give a [ __ ] what we want is the
48:48 world to be clean air to be clean we
48:51 want the cyclical illnesses to come
48:53 right after these things are sprayed
48:54 also in the summertime right in America
48:57 ten years ago they coined the summer
48:58 cold because everyone's breathing this
49:02 particulate which makes us sick I'll get
49:04 to that before we get out of here this
49:07 is a little bit of a duplicate of the
49:08 season one episode but I'm going at it
49:10 from a really the standpoint of being a
49:14 warrior for the world you know you got
49:17 to be one so Olga it's only going to
49:19 stop with global consciousness it's not
49:21 going to stop if someone makes the best
49:23 goddamn video on YouTube big deal
49:25 everyone's got to figure this [ __ ] out
49:27 you know but the other side of the coin
49:30 is if someone said you got to go up to
49:33 the biggest volcano you can get your
49:34 hands on and jump in and you die you're
49:38 dead I'm sure you might believe in
49:40 reincarnation all kind of stuff but what
49:41 you are today will cease to exist
49:44 but as a result of that sacrifice
49:48 chemtrails will go away forever and
49:50 nothing will ever replace them the air
49:53 will be clean for the rest of humanity
49:56 everyone I know would jump in that
49:57 volcano in a heartbeat this ain't some
50:02 technique to be popular you know we're
50:06 not sawing out videos on YouTube trying
50:09 to to do [ __ ] clickbait titles and
50:12 [ __ ] right so what does it make you sick
50:16 because a lot of people again there's
50:18 it's easy to disinfo some of the claims
50:21 because it's like cellphones creating
50:23 cancer you know they picked out the
50:26 elements of a cell phone that absolutely
50:27 do not cause cancer and then said look
50:29 how ridiculous this theory is when they
50:31 ignore the power supply completely right
50:34 there is and this is something I'm going
50:36 to repeat
50:37 probably a couple of times with season 3
50:38 here but there's something called the
50:39 law of particulates and that is very
50:43 easily explained as what we are supposed
50:45 to be breathing is exactly what our
50:47 bodies are designed to breathe which is
50:49 pure oxygen there's more to it than just
50:53 oxygen but we're supposed to breathe the
50:55 cleanest oxygen we possibly can right
50:57 that's why people get in these tubes to
50:59 stay young yeah one thought Michael
51:01 Jackson was crazy for getting in one of
51:03 those those kind of oxygen lung things
51:05 there's a lot of people in Hollywood to
51:07 do it and they look pretty good
51:08 apparently they're not that expensive
51:10 either but here's the thing if your body
51:13 cannot breathe pure oxygen then you are
51:18 malnourished when it comes to
51:21 oxygenating your blood which is a very
51:23 important process for the human body it
51:26 allows you to flush out toxins you know
51:28 drinking water is good too we have the
51:31 sky filled with all these chemicals we
51:33 are breathing things that are knocking
51:35 down our immune system it's knocking
51:36 down the power supply to the human body
51:39 because it's got to filter out this
51:40 particulate again studied Russel
51:43 Blaylock Svidler controls because he's
51:46 done the analysis of nano-sized aluminum
51:49 what you think the guy [ __ ] made this
51:51 stuff happen do you realize that you
51:53 can't get nano-sized aluminum easily in
51:55 the world you don't go down to Walmart
51:56 and buy it you know go on Amazon and buy
51:58 a bag of it the machinery that makes
52:01 this stuff is typically hoarded within
52:03 military industrial complexes with the
52:05 most security you could possibly put on
52:07 a building right and again we're not
52:11 sure who the hell is actually doing this
52:13 right it would appear as if military
52:16 organizations and the Air Force have
52:19 covert annexed hangers that do it
52:22 because of the woman that used to do it
52:24 in Oklahoma and then she moved to
52:26 Georgia after nine years of helping
52:28 supply these planes with barium oxide
52:30 and aluminum oxide coming in from
52:31 phantom vendors and having the
52:34 designation of privacy to the point
52:36 where she wasn't able to to check them
52:38 in she had to give them the pass at the
52:40 door to drive into the base but she
52:41 wasn't allowed to ask him you know how
52:44 much do I owe you for this and who are
52:45 who the [ __ ] are you right she said they
52:47 would move into the base go to these
52:49 private
52:50 hangers and fill up planes and I'm sure
52:53 she's a liar right I'm sure she's out
52:55 there opening for concerts and putting
52:57 her whole life on the line out there
52:59 just because it's fun she needs
53:01 attention right that's what the cynics
53:04 say that's what the people who have
53:06 joined them say so what happens is after
53:09 your immune system gets knocked down
53:10 what happens when your immune system
53:11 gets knocked down you catch what's going
53:13 around that's all it's not like they're
53:16 injecting flu in this guy it's just you
53:20 know technically they could probably
53:22 encapsulated in some fiber and you
53:24 breathe it you melt the fire bro you
53:25 catch whatever reason maybe if you don't
53:27 have to you just catch whatever is going
53:30 around look at all the people that have
53:33 slaved in coal mines over the years back
53:35 before machines we're doing most of what
53:37 you know them you know machines do now
53:39 what the men used to do personally they
53:42 had black lung and they got sick
53:45 constantly lived in a constant state of
53:47 sickness because of it the sacs in their
53:52 lungs are covered in soot even though
53:55 they might wear a mask in the more
53:57 recent century it's still all around
54:00 them constantly and they get sick it's
54:03 from the law of particulates but they're
54:04 breathing coal dust and dust dust and
54:06 everything else is down there it's bad
54:10 for you so we're in this big green
54:13 movement in the world right we're in
54:15 this big movement where it's like
54:16 cleanup all the the carbon in the sky
54:18 hey I kind of dig that personally I
54:21 don't like being taxed to global warming
54:22 but hey we should go to every single
54:25 plant and durable countries especially
54:26 and say that black [ __ ] coming out of
54:28 that smokestack has got to stop
54:30 otherwise we're going to stop it for you
54:32 right but if that's an objective of
54:36 mankind which is a noble one then why
54:39 would we allow claims to make clouds to
54:44 spray anything out of the back any
54:46 anomaly especially low altitudes that
54:48 could drift down on the people and this
54:51 goes to the geoengineering program
54:53 that's been announced when asked 10
54:56 years ago at the conference in San Diego
54:58 the geoengineering conference in San
54:59 Diego what do you think that the had
55:01 there been any tests
55:03 - say what aluminum oxide would do to
55:05 the population they said they hadn't
55:06 researched it yet dr. Russell Blaylock
55:09 retired neurosurgeon said I'll tell you
55:12 exactly what it does it goes up into
55:13 your nose goes right through your
55:15 blood-brain barrier and hosts itself in
55:17 your brain and we all know that
55:20 Alzheimer's and dementia patients have
55:24 aluminium accumulation in the brain
55:27 again when you grow up in a big city you
55:30 may or may not get the lineage of your
55:33 people in conversation because there's
55:36 too many people there's too much renewal
55:37 there's too much turnover there's too
55:39 many transient people if you never can
55:41 have a conversation about hey grandpa
55:44 tell me what the world was like 50 years
55:46 ago and tell me about your father and
55:49 your grandfather let's go back a hundred
55:51 and fifty years what was the world like
55:52 back then luckily your humble narrator
55:55 grew up in a tiny little town for 12
55:57 years and the heritage of our town is
56:01 everywhere it's in the architecture it's
56:04 in the businesses it's in the
56:06 educational system it is what you go and
56:09 listen to you know I used to carve wood
56:11 with my grandfather and we'd sit in this
56:13 room with guys from [ __ ] 90 years old
56:15 all the way down to 12 years old all
56:18 whittling away wood and talking about
56:20 the town a hundred years ago 150 years
56:23 ago and what people died of and what
56:25 they didn't die of and I will tell you
56:27 right now
56:28 in my personal history with my hometown
56:31 the first case of Alzheimer's that ever
56:33 showed up was in 1986 85 86 what else
56:39 also debuted into the world about five
56:41 years earlier aluminum cans aluminum
56:44 became this big recyclable thing you
56:48 know I happen to be part of a family
56:50 that had you know my great great
56:52 grandfather lived 101 and his father to
56:54 be 104 so we're where most families
56:57 would have the new generation every 15
56:59 to 20 years because people start having
57:01 kids around 15 back in the day my family
57:05 went 205 years with just two gentlemen
57:08 and so I get to have the information
57:12 about those individuals was because one
57:14 of them was fairly celebrated because he
57:16 was so
57:16 old and he was part of the Civil War he
57:19 did two tours in Civil War and so
57:21 presidents would write him letters and
57:23 he would get interviewed all the time
57:24 and so they constantly asked him why we
57:26 all what keeps you old what what's
57:28 what's been your health regimen how many
57:30 teeth have you lost that kind of stuff
57:32 right so the guy that lived to be 101 I
57:35 think he lost one tooth when he was
57:37 young during the Civil War what would be
57:41 the regimen if he was transplanted to
57:42 today I'll get that fluoride in your
57:45 system the byproduct of fluorine that
57:47 comes from making aluminum up until 19
57:51 was at 49 it was considered one of the
57:53 most toxic chemicals on planet earth but
57:54 by 1955 it was in all of our [ __ ]
57:56 toothpaste the funny thing that I I just
58:00 want to close on is this notion when you
58:03 find someone who's given up what they're
58:06 sort of a saying when they when they go
58:07 through all the conspiracies of the
58:09 world and they just throw kind of
58:11 lowbrow you know ankle-deep research on
58:15 every topic and they try to say it's not
58:18 this it's not this it's not this it's
58:21 all official story stuff right is that
58:25 what they're saying is is that the world
58:26 is pretty much perfect and that's an
58:30 it's kind of an absurd adjective but the
58:32 idea is they've got an excuse for
58:35 everything and making an official story
58:37 and I guarantee you the reason why
58:38 they've gone this route as it lets them
58:41 sleep at night that's why and again
58:45 that's why I always stress on this show
58:47 if you're doing research and you're
58:49 evangelizing some of the darkness you're
58:53 going to need a break you will because
58:55 you're just going to get overwhelmed
58:56 perhaps with the negativity or how you
58:58 interpret it it's not a feeling you want
59:00 to have it's not a thought you want to
59:01 have so just take a break but don't I
59:03 mean this is my this is my advice my
59:06 advice is don't join them and especially
59:09 don't go out and whitewash it now I'm
59:12 going to use a fictional example of
59:15 where being a teacher or being anyone
59:19 that passes information along is a very
59:22 dangerous thing and it's it comes with
59:25 the maximum amount of responsibility as
59:28 a human being that you could possibly
59:30 have
59:30 which is the following and I'm gonna
59:33 give you a fictional one is you're going
59:34 to laugh but just hang in there Star
59:37 Wars the movie fictional sci-fi obi-wan
59:42 Kenobi he trains Anakin Skywalker and it
59:45 can fell and went to the dark side he
59:48 got enough information to be dangerous
59:50 he wasn't stabilized mentally and
59:52 spiritually and so he was able to be
59:54 pulled away by the Emperor and becomes
59:56 dark and now the universe has to deal
59:59 with Darth Vader here comes Luke
60:02 Skywalker an idealistic 17 year old kid
60:05 learns about this villain and dedicates
60:08 his whole life to getting rid of the
60:09 darkness and of course the whole twist
60:10 that they're related
60:11 the problem with whitewashing all this
60:13 stuff and you know there's one thing to
60:17 say you're going to make a video where
60:18 you're talking about you're skeptical
60:20 you know you were totally on board and
60:23 now you figured out some other things
60:24 and it seems like it makes sense and
60:25 you're skeptical right and then there's
60:28 one thing to say it is definitely not
60:30 what you think it is it's all good and
60:32 it's all great when you become an
60:35 educator of any kind and you see
60:37 something go wrong you've taught someone
60:39 something and they took it the wrong way
60:41 and they start going down a really dark
60:42 path and then their brain they're not
60:44 going down a dark path it's a hell of a
60:48 thing to be responsible for that
60:51 catalyst of someone's life going dark
60:54 and you know part of the reason why you
60:58 know I wanted to get rid of the MKULTRA
61:00 radio show was that we started off
61:04 trying to expose as much as we possibly
61:06 could we got to the point we exposed it
61:08 all and then we got into the current
61:09 events stuff and I thought that we just
61:12 weren't doing enough research to really
61:14 validate the episodes and I didn't want
61:17 to have any part of it because we're
61:19 both too busy to really give it in
61:20 equality and so that's why I bring this
61:23 show on board because it allowed us to
61:26 go deeper into the subjects represent
61:29 both sides of the coin as much as
61:31 possible and sort of let you go off and
61:33 do your own research
61:35 you should still do that with chemtrails
61:37 for sure it is my personal belief
61:40 through all of the research that I just
61:43 described in the
61:43 so that I believe that they are
61:45 unequivocally real and it's just
61:48 straight logic for how they spray their
61:50 stuff all the claims for the alternate
61:53 theories of persistent contrails the
61:55 fact they don't teach pilots about
61:56 consistent consistent persistent
61:58 contrails I would imagine that today
62:00 honestly those classes that the guy
62:04 interviewed as a private pilot talked
62:05 about they're probably adding persistent
62:08 contrails to the curriculum at this
62:09 point I would imagine but this guy was
62:12 educated between 2000 and 2005 and he
62:16 said it didn't exist
62:17 the theory was not communicated to
62:20 pilots and he said look if this stuff
62:22 was at our level at 30,000 feet or above
62:25 because they'd have to teach us because
62:27 we'd be running into this [ __ ] and it
62:29 really [ __ ] up visibility because when
62:32 I was flying to g5 back from South
62:34 America because I had to change I didn't
62:37 to change my lane in in the air because
62:41 I'm flying behind this goddamn plane
62:43 it's barfing out this at night it's dark
62:47 when you hit this stuff it's dark and so
62:50 you got permission to move out of the
62:52 way the changes corridor I think most of
62:55 you are really dedicated to your own
62:58 research I really do believe that you if
63:01 you've even clicked on this particular
63:02 title you're a person who is probably I
63:06 would imagine 90% of people that click
63:08 on this have already heard of chemtrails
63:09 you've already done your research you
63:11 may or may not have taken a bunch of
63:12 photographs you may or may not have done
63:14 interviews on the ground with people
63:16 that have you know again thousands of
63:18 hours of research and the education
63:20 around this conversation but for those
63:23 of you who are brand new to it your
63:25 inquisitive your interested in it again
63:27 ghosts go look up Russell blade locks
63:29 videos on chemtrails because he's just a
63:31 really solid resource for the truth in
63:36 my opinion nobody wants this stuff to be
63:39 real nobody nobody's looking for a
63:42 subscription to their [ __ ] Channel in
63:45 this camp for bringing you darkness it's
63:51 not fun it's not fun to go out and think
63:53 about this if you want to see a pretty
63:56 good gallery of
63:57 chemtrail photographs go to one page
64:00 news.com I believe the rightmost
64:03 navigation is Kym trails if you just
64:05 mouse over it and click down you'll see
64:07 chemtrail gallery and it has thousands
64:11 of photographs in it from all around the
64:13 world and it'll start to sink in how big
64:17 this program is and some of you think
64:19 well it can't be real because that's too
64:21 big of a program believe me I understand
64:24 I think they've had decades to to
64:28 rationalize whatever they're doing and
64:30 to bring on the the dedicated you know
64:36 resources to make it happen so the final
64:40 question to answer it to attempt to
64:42 answer is why and again I have an
64:44 ellipsis ode on the question why the
64:48 problem with the question why when it
64:49 comes to chemtrails is we're not exactly
64:51 sure why it makes people sick people get
64:55 sick they go to hospitals they get
64:57 injected full of a ton of stuff I
64:58 guarantee you the pharmaceutical
65:00 industry just the over-the-counter
65:02 pharmaceutical industry makes billions
65:05 and billions a year from from these
65:08 trails being sprayed in the sky because
65:11 everyone gets the cold and they get what
65:13 they call the flu the advanced cold
65:15 again if you're suffering from an
65:18 ailment and you need your immune system
65:19 to help fight the suffering and the
65:22 infection or the cancer okay this stuff
65:26 in the sky is making it more difficult
65:28 for you to fight whatever you have so if
65:32 you're trying to get out of stage four
65:33 cancer stage three cancer or something
65:35 and you're breathing this [ __ ] it ain't
65:37 doing you any favors trust me so so now
65:42 there's two sides of this coin at this
65:44 point there's the conspiracy that's been
65:47 going on in on YouTube for twenty years
65:49 ninety seven to twenty seventeen twenty
65:52 years people been trying to expose
65:54 chemtrails keep getting told that they
65:56 don't exist now we have it in the public
65:59 press that they are now green-lighting
66:01 this global warming shield so you can
66:05 expect never to see the trail spray for
66:07 the global warming shield because it
66:09 will not be sprayed below forty thousand
66:11 feet
66:12 does anything below forty thousand feet
66:13 scale and on our head isn't it
66:15 so the guys very really high so you
66:17 shouldn't see any this stuff if they do
66:19 it but have they done any due diligence
66:21 on what the chemicals that they choose
66:23 to spray up there are going to do to
66:25 humanity when it finally lands in our
66:27 lungs I don't have any any evidence
66:32 whatsoever that they've done any
66:35 research the only time the question was
66:36 ever asked to my knowledge was in San
66:38 Diego place the same place they do
66:41 comic-con down there and the Geno
66:42 engineer showed up and said they were
66:44 going to spray luminol bauxite in the
66:46 sky
66:47 to protect us against global warming and
66:49 they were asked have you done any due
66:50 diligence on what this does to human
66:52 beings I said not yet so we should be
66:56 able to find that research right someone
66:58 has to contest dr. blank Russell
67:00 Blaylock's personal investigation and
67:03 personal medical knowledge about how
67:05 it's going to go up into our brains if
67:08 if alzheimer's has an accumulation of
67:11 aluminum which has been there the
67:12 evidence since 1985 my physics teacher
67:15 taught it in high school
67:17 Alzheimer's that is and the aluminum
67:19 accumulation in the brain then you
67:22 shouldn't be allowed to spray the stuff
67:23 in the sky should you just that simple
67:26 just that simple so I'll leave it up to
67:29 you but you know I I really just hate to
67:34 see someone get out there and whitewash
67:36 the whole thing and do it so [ __ ]
67:39 matter-of-fact man just just say don't
67:41 worry about it and they're [ __ ]
67:43 stupid and I read Wikipedia and
67:45 [ __ ] I have all the news on
67:47 planet Earth now I've got all the
67:48 science I need to know alright you're
67:52 just like you know one step from going
67:54 to a bathhouse with [ __ ] Bill Nye and
67:57 Neil deGrasse Tyson at that point on
67:59 that note I thank you feel me I think
68:02 that's it deep thoughts radio calm for
68:05 all the feeds there's video if you come
68:07 in on audio audio for coming on video it
68:09 is on iTunes as well again if you want
68:13 to watch season one and its pristine
68:14 perfect quality go to vid dot me and
68:19 your web browser look for deep thoughts
68:20 radio it's in the brain so
68:23 food category again I've got a special
68:25 agreement with them to let me put these
68:27 really long episodes because you don't
68:29 usually have the capability posting
68:31 anything over about 15 minutes without
68:33 their permission they've been really
68:35 great to me to allow me to do that it is
68:38 not as up-to-date as the YouTube channel
68:41 because now you want to keep YouTube
68:43 being the primary way to ingest the
68:46 content so I think it's a superior
68:47 service with great comments and stuff
68:50 there's a patreon account for those of
68:52 you who are interested in contributing
68:53 I'm going to be posting stuff into the
68:56 patreon account
68:57 I forgot that I need to fill that up
68:59 with a bunch of episodes and that sort
69:01 of thing I am going to create some
69:02 reward packages for patreon I finally
69:06 figured out kind of what I can do so
69:07 there might be some situations where a
69:10 one-time donation might get we could do
69:14 some Skype sessions personally for a
69:17 particular amount and I think that might
69:21 be kind of fun anyway
69:24 take care of yourself in someone else
69:25 then I'll see you in the next detox over
69:27 now
