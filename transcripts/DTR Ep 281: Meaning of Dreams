00:00 [Music]
00:34 welcome back ladies and gentlemen the
00:36 deep thoughts today I'm gonna do another
00:40 episode about dreams and sort of the
00:45 concept that dreams may or may not ever
00:48 have meaning it was interesting when I
00:51 was a kid you'd have dreams and it was
00:52 no big deal and well as a matter of fact
00:56 this actually gets a little bit weird
00:58 when I was a kid you'd have dreams you'd
01:01 have amazing dreams and the weird thing
01:03 is is that when you sat down at the
01:05 dinner table at night people would say
01:06 how was your day and you're supposed to
01:09 recall your your day as it relates to
01:12 your five-sense reality what didn't
01:16 happen was getting up in the morning and
01:20 sitting down for breakfast and someone
01:21 says how were your dreams and I think
01:26 that's weird
01:27 and variably I always had dreams but no
01:32 one ever asked me about them because
01:34 perhaps they didn't have dreams and
01:35 talking about dreams always sort of felt
01:38 a bit like talking about your privacy
01:43 you know your your I don't know your
01:46 sexual regiment or whatever it always
01:49 had a bizarre thing to it now there's an
01:54 amazing little correlation with what I'm
01:57 saying here in my mind with the show the
02:01 HBO show Westworld for those of you who
02:04 haven't seen it shame on you
02:06 go subscribe to either Amazon Prime or
02:09 HBO and get it
02:12 Westworld is a show based
02:14 on michael crichton's movie West's role
02:16 with Yul Brynner where they've created
02:19 this sort of amusement park with a bunch
02:23 of robots which they call hosts you are
02:26 the guests you go and live your fantasy
02:28 out in one of several worlds the show
02:32 launched on HBO with the Western world
02:34 was called skies called West world same
02:37 as a movie and things go south you know
02:41 relatively soon but at a nice slow pace
02:44 but there's one thing that they wrote
02:46 into the HBO series that I do not
02:48 believe was ever in the movie which is
02:50 that when a host stares that information
02:53 that they are not supposed to see they
02:58 can't see it they look at it and someone
03:02 will say well what do you think this
03:03 looks like and they'll say I don't think
03:06 it looks like anything because in their
03:08 brain they've had it blocked right now
03:11 again according to anthropologist and
03:15 you know our our visual cortex has been
03:19 genetically blocked there's a genetic
03:21 blocker that prohibits us from seeing
03:24 the other 90% of what we could be
03:29 processing in terms of incoming
03:30 information now maybe that makes us
03:32 crazy but LSD crawls right up your back
03:35 goes right over your visual cortex
03:36 padding and all of a sudden you can
03:38 start seeing geometry it's as if we've
03:42 been genetically patched not to see it
03:46 we're pretty goddamn close to being able
03:49 to do something like that today aren't
03:50 we budgin we were just genetically
03:53 patched you know and the families that
03:57 run the place can see and that's why
04:01 they all are related to each other half
04:03 the time right we're all related to each
04:05 other but you know I'm saying but why
04:07 isn't it that we don't talk about our
04:10 dreams on a regular basis
04:13 I'm either I'm the only guy on this
04:15 whole planet is having the most
04:17 incredible full sensory dreams and I
04:22 wouldn't say I've got all five senses
04:23 but I've got a bunch of him as far as
04:28 touch goes it's very touchy you know I
04:30 call pick up someone when I was in a
04:32 dream the other day where I to pick up a
04:34 girlfriend and and move her from one
04:36 place to another real quick
04:38 she was light as a feather and I felt
04:40 like little sort of bumps on my body
04:43 nothing like it would really be I was
04:46 holding someone in a dream with a lot of
04:49 people were all laying down and were
04:52 just having a moment and totally felt my
04:55 body wrapped around this person very
04:57 interesting but I could have the most
05:01 incredibly deep emotional realizations
05:06 and swings inside of a dream the things
05:08 that would make you cry if I turn them
05:09 into movies to the point of like you're
05:12 laughing your head off because it's the
05:14 funniest joke ever told in the room to
05:16 the best action movie and what's
05:21 weirdest I feel like I'm bragging about
05:23 my dreams and I'm I'm not I'm simply
05:26 saying this is what happens to me when I
05:28 go to bed at night it's going from one
05:30 reality to the other reality in because
05:32 I'm so aware of it I distinctly can wake
05:35 up and go okay this is what happens in
05:38 this reality that doesn't happen and the
05:40 other out reality and vice versa right
05:42 you get benefits and from both realities
05:45 right you can do things in this one you
05:48 can't do and the other and vice versa in
05:52 this reality I will say that all of the
05:55 senses are seemingly exponentially more
05:59 intense and more vivid when you go into
06:02 a dream realm for me personally you get
06:05 more subject freedom you get to move
06:10 around you can control the dream you can
06:13 fly you can even get loose it and start
06:16 controlling everything about it right
06:18 but I feel like the subject of dreams
06:21 what I'll ask you know every once in a
06:23 while ask some people in the room in the
06:27 clown jazz I go to and I'll say you know
06:28 if I can get something like that going
06:30 her to barbecue when smoking cigars and
06:32 I'll say well you know do you guys dream
06:33 and it's man it's like I'm asking
06:37 everyone to drop their drawers or
06:40 something you know me it's just like it
06:42 was like oh you know I don't get it it's
06:46 like it's like the hosts in Westworld
06:52 saying I don't think it looks like
06:53 anything you know and yet you know I
06:57 know I'm being a little silly because
06:58 there are research facilities around the
07:00 world that get into this very deeply you
07:03 know but I think my slant on this one is
07:06 to say we're gonna we're gonna update
07:09 some things about what I've realized
07:11 about my dreaming just because I'm the
07:13 only one here but the other half I'm
07:17 going to talk about this notion that
07:20 people want to find meaning in their
07:22 dreams and my particular journey down
07:25 that path because it's a definite
07:30 journey that you know seems to have very
07:33 quarantined groups of people that would
07:36 want to find out meaning in a dream and
07:39 people who simply study dreams and then
07:43 thus those of us are just people not
07:46 trying to do much besides share a few
07:48 notes right the first time I ever heard
07:53 anyone talk about a dream having a
07:55 meaning was probably in my late teens
08:01 when I first moved to California and
08:04 someone I worked with would be in fact
08:08 I'm not even sure anybody was talking to
08:10 me personally it may have been someone
08:12 talking to someone else and simply
08:14 saying well you know what that means
08:16 right you know I'm walking up to
08:17 conversation
08:20 I scream in and what was interesting
08:24 about the idea that somehow the idea
08:28 that you could buy a book and this is
08:30 what happened was I heard this notion
08:32 this concept that dreams could have
08:34 meanings okay because it's really not in
08:37 any of the movies that ever seen all
08:39 right an omen is usually something
08:41 happens in this world a black crow sits
08:44 on your your the end of your bed and
08:46 looks at you you know they're like
08:47 things that occur to you in the real
08:49 world all the superstitions of the world
08:51 black hat walks in front of you all that
08:54 kind of crap but this notion that
08:56 someone could tell someone else what
08:58 their dream means is interesting I know
09:03 that my dreams mock my reality therefore
09:06 one could say that dream means that you
09:10 are having this feeling that does happen
09:14 it does happen so dreams have meanings
09:17 that the ones that I first heard were
09:19 sort of just like opening a fortune
09:23 cookie well you know if you dream of a
09:27 white horse that means you're gone
09:29 you're coming into money soon I kind of
09:31 shed right now I shouldn't say it that
09:36 way because if you tell people what they
09:39 want to hear and they can believe it
09:41 though manifest it right they'll attract
09:44 it to themselves right you know what it
09:47 sounds like a crime but it's probably
09:49 not the doctors in South America that
09:53 use all kinds of trickery with chicken
09:56 parts and they pretend like they're
09:57 digging it out of your gut and they pull
09:59 it out they say you're healed the
10:02 skeptic Society guy with the big beard
10:05 those of this Cuban boyfriend which is
10:08 really strange because the kids like
10:09 what younger than him and even know if
10:11 this guy's still alive anymore he went
10:14 down there and and busted all these
10:16 people in the name of hey these are scam
10:19 artists they're stealing money from
10:20 people and these people are dying as a
10:22 result of their debt of their sicknesses
10:24 right now part of you goes whoa no wait
10:28 a minute yeah from the face value that
10:30 makes a lot of sense I wouldn't want
10:31 someone to scam anyone in the
10:34 but if law of attraction and bio
10:37 feedback therapy of believing that you
10:40 have acquired a cure of some sort or
10:44 you're being cured over time and
10:47 therefore you get into the hot springs
10:49 of you know South America and you grow
10:52 your pelvis back from having bone cancer
10:55 well who cares how you get it who cares
10:59 but what happens if you can't mentally
11:02 cure something out of belief well your
11:05 only hope at that point is that someone
11:08 gives you a shot or a pill or at least
11:10 convinces you that you're gonna have to
11:13 buy something like that and therefore
11:14 trade a commodity for it piece of gold
11:17 some fiat currency and one of those
11:22 organizations run by oh they're run by
11:24 crooks and so it might be one of these
11:28 things to get rid of even placebo
11:30 techniques of curing people I know I
11:33 just went off the rails there but it's
11:35 just interesting the idea that there's a
11:38 lookup book that says you dream of this
11:41 vision and this vision means this thing
11:45 is sort of silly in the realm of it
11:51 suggests that the god or gods that made
11:54 this place have this little I don't know
11:59 kind of Nintendo game that goes on now
12:03 if you see this in your dream it's a
12:05 bonus Billy make sure and step on the
12:08 heart because the Unicorn comes out and
12:10 farts rainbows so there's the more sort
12:14 of palm-reading version of dream
12:16 meanings where they're trying to give
12:19 you a frequency of law of attraction and
12:22 yeah if you hear what I'm saying you're
12:24 like [ __ ] you man
12:25 I like that other technique of being
12:27 told what my dreams are because my palm
12:30 reader knows how much I'm struggling in
12:32 life and I want to believe her and she
12:34 at least tells me what I need to hear it
12:36 makes me feel positive and my cure
12:38 myself I support you a thousand percent
12:42 thousand percent but now some folks will
12:46 go over to
12:47 psychiatrists or psychologists and they
12:51 will sit down and have reflection
12:53 sessions they'll talk about their dreams
12:57 Freud was really into dreams and what
13:00 the scientist will do is try to parse
13:04 the theme of your dream what if you're
13:08 always being chased in your dream chase
13:10 chase chase chase well there's got to be
13:13 a reason why you're feeling chased I
13:17 listen to some of my friends talk about
13:20 their lives and you know I've got
13:23 friends who live in hospitals not
13:25 because they're really sick but because
13:27 they're hypochondriacs it's a way to get
13:32 perhaps a social interaction I go to a
13:34 smoke lounge to talk to dudes and a few
13:37 chicks at these locations and it's a
13:40 little social interaction there right
13:43 I'm constantly meeting people so I
13:45 always have plenty of interaction but
13:47 you know when you need it you go get it
13:50 and some people live in hospitals they
13:52 like to call their friends and tell them
13:54 about the latest illness they have they
13:58 don't realize it perhaps but they're
13:59 talking about themselves being stressed
14:01 all the time and how they can't function
14:04 properly because they're stressed all
14:05 the time it becomes this crazy [ __ ]
14:08 dependency the endorphin of being in
14:12 trouble some people dig it they like
14:15 being in trouble there's criminals in
14:18 prisons all around the world and the
14:21 most the biggest bummer for them is that
14:25 they haven't had that feeling of
14:27 committing a crime in a really long time
14:29 so they'll volunteer to do something
14:32 really horrible in prison because they
14:34 just want to be alive right it's a
14:40 bummer so we got to work harder to
14:43 create more fulfilment in this world
14:46 about hurting people but I can tell you
14:50 then in my dreams if I am dealing with
14:55 an unsolved problem in the real world of
14:59 a particular subject matter
15:01 I will dream that thing in my dream and
15:04 it will go from sort of level it's like
15:09 a scale from one to ten slightly
15:12 frustrating dream is like a level one
15:14 where you know it's chill it's you know
15:17 the really intense going on but what
15:18 happens is I can never really quite get
15:20 where I'm going it's like a labyrinth
15:22 from the movie labyrinth it's just I
15:24 don't I can't find the wormed guy to go
15:26 hello some of you will get that
15:29 reference
15:30 level ten is I haven't had level ten in
15:36 a long time but I was a little kid I
15:37 used to have a level ten all the time
15:39 level ten is very kind of altered states
15:44 existence of where I am pretty much the
15:48 size of perhaps a human cell and I am
15:55 incapable of doing much besides having
15:57 consciousness in this grid of cells that
16:00 are constantly changing around me and
16:02 but I have the I have the consciousness
16:04 of a full-blown soul but I'm in that
16:08 prime mortal first splitting of myself
16:11 inside my mom right or something like
16:13 that it's I know it sounds intense
16:17 level nine was more terrifying I'm just
16:21 gonna arbitrarily make these happen
16:23 because I think 10 was sort of like the
16:25 you're in a Zen ish level of frustration
16:28 in all of these have this bizarre like
16:33 level 10 the reason why I put the level
16:35 10 and not this next one a level 10
16:37 occurs when you hear this next one you
16:38 really Jesus that sounds more like level
16:40 10 is that when you don't have a true
16:45 wiring to your five senses imagine like
16:48 you had five wires coming out of
16:51 yourself they're supposed to plug into
16:53 sight you know sound all your emotions
16:56 and what-have-you and they're kind of
16:59 just rubbing against things and in
17:00 various inputs from this weird thing
17:03 called a cell is hearing is going into
17:08 your site your site's going at a hearing
17:09 and your touch is going into something
17:12 else
17:14 you you know you're not really in any
17:17 harm's way you're not in trouble or
17:20 anything but you just can't be you can't
17:22 settle down it's very disturbing and
17:25 when I used to have those dreams what
17:27 would happen is I'd be laying in my bed
17:29 looking at the room and I have complete
17:31 you know that's my bedroom it's dark
17:33 whatever it's all purple and then as I
17:36 closed my eyes what happened would be
17:37 that's like the television would come
17:41 down to this other reality and I would
17:42 be in this other reality if I wise back
17:45 in the room but closed my eyes I'm back
17:47 and I could even just half closed my
17:49 eyes and the upper half of my lid is
17:51 would be in this weird world and it was
17:54 like it's a bizarre experience I haven't
17:56 had that in a really long time and as a
17:58 child I could not for the life of me
18:01 explain what was going on and it was
18:05 only as I got older that I was able to
18:07 parse it a couple times when I felt it
18:09 happening nowadays if it starts to
18:12 happen I wake back up turn the light on
18:14 and read a book and just shake it out of
18:16 my system it's a really bizarre you know
18:19 but level nine when I was a kid was very
18:22 personal it was one of them when I you
18:27 know I had to watch a lot of Star Trek
18:28 as a child which probably made my brain
18:31 a little bit it was just way way more
18:34 intense and I'm talking two three four
18:37 years old it was intense for me to try
18:39 to figure out why Captain Kirk was
18:41 fighting a lizard in Apple Valley it was
18:42 just bizarre the sets were always
18:46 strange weren't they they always look
18:47 like these clinical sets just polished
18:50 cement floors you could see the fact
18:53 that the walls have space on the bottom
18:55 like someone's wheeled it in the room
18:56 and as a child I don't know anything
18:58 about special effects or or Sound
19:00 Studios but I can tell I can tell us was
19:02 faked
19:03 because I know what my house looks like
19:04 and so my my brain I don't know what age
19:10 three or four or five somewhere in there
19:11 it created this room where I was
19:15 standing on a clean slab floor kind of
19:19 dimly lit like Captain Kirk's quarters
19:22 or they want to make it look sexy and
19:24 I've got
19:26 at least four posts kind like a soccer
19:29 ring around they've probably more it's
19:31 probably some bizarre shape but every
19:35 about two or three inches up is a is a
19:39 tight thinned wire a bit like the wires
19:42 you would find in those oil lamp
19:43 shipping in your corners in the 70s and
19:46 they're up about you know about every
19:47 three inches or so boom as far as I can
19:50 see the bottom maybe it's like six
19:52 inches off the ground the first one and
19:54 they're these beads hanging like a an
19:58 obelisk no like a abacus one of those
20:02 things where they're perfectly spaced
20:06 out and they don't move like maybe every
20:08 three inches on these wires actually I
20:12 think I had one where they were packed
20:13 you know it's like the scoring system
20:16 when you play pool and all I could hear
20:18 is my dad's voice and I can see through
20:21 the wires the room is much bigger than
20:23 I'm in it's it's probably 20 by 30 and
20:27 I'm in like a 10 by 12 maybe I was a
20:32 teeny kid so who knows maybe was a
20:33 little tiny thing but he's telling me to
20:37 come on to come with him come on man
20:39 let's go let's go gotta go he's he's got
20:43 his voice cone my dad was military so
20:46 you can imagine where that might have
20:47 come from but I can't get out of this
20:50 place and the second I try I break a
20:55 string and all these beads hit the
20:57 ground and now I'm in trouble my dad's
21:00 getting more angry and I can't get out
21:03 of this [ __ ] thing you know but it
21:06 never was a nightmare you know I've got
21:09 episodes where I talk about my
21:10 nightmares those are different then zazz
21:14 fightin dreams right where eventually
21:17 just to kind of recap for those of you
21:19 never heard it before he said this dream
21:22 with as a mannequin used to terrify me
21:23 you know when I first saw him adding him
21:25 without a neck without a head you know
21:26 it was the cut neck thing very popular
21:28 in the seventies I think that horrified
21:30 me a little bit because I had one they
21:35 pinned me down into bed but the
21:36 comforter up to my neck and covered my
21:39 bed with a porcelain
21:41 [ __ ] I'm like two or three years old
21:44 doing this my realm is all ornate and
21:46 amazing but this manikin woman is
21:48 hitting my bed with her weird hand and
21:51 going get out of bed get out of it so
21:53 I'm trying to get out but I'm underneath
21:54 the sheet as soon as I move the sheet
21:56 this comforter it's knocking over these
21:59 big clunky beautiful ornate pottery
22:02 train pieces and then she's yelling up
22:05 because I'm breaking that train and I
22:06 went on and on for God probably to the
22:09 age of three and seven somewhere in
22:11 there but at seven I just said [ __ ] this
22:15 man I'm not gonna put up with this [ __ ]
22:17 anymore and I threw the blanket off and
22:19 turn a fluid on top of her and sort of
22:22 stomped on her and everything and then I
22:24 went around the corner and Wonder Woman
22:26 was sitting in the in this side bathroom
22:29 that I didn't actually have my life with
22:31 my parents had a master bedroom they had
22:32 a side bedroom I thought that was so
22:34 cool they didn't realize you could have
22:36 more than one bathroom and at home then
22:39 I sat in her lap and she's looking hot
22:42 as hell and then her head falls out of
22:46 her hair and there's the neck and it's
22:48 like the end of a scary Twilight Zone
22:49 all I hear is this crazy laugh but still
22:52 I was like yeah all right that freaked
22:55 me out at the end Touche but I'm done
22:57 with your [ __ ] this dream ended which is
22:59 why I didn't attack you a second time
23:02 and from that point in the real world I
23:04 was stronger I wasn't gonna put up with
23:07 anyone's [ __ ] right to the best of
23:10 my ability and it's it worked I saw her
23:13 again once when I was 11 or 12 years old
23:15 and we had just a [ __ ] brawl at my
23:19 cousin's house in a dream because I was
23:22 sleeping at his house it's weird right
23:26 right so I mentioned that little
23:30 digression because we do get disturbed
23:35 by things and we get pleased by things
23:38 and it affects the overall story arc of
23:41 our dreams so but now that's a
23:47 mechanical premise a mechanical
23:52 cause-and-effect in your dream
23:54 and it may not really mean anything
23:59 someone can say well you know what that
24:01 means and I go what and they say well
24:04 you're stressed in real life
24:06 that's why you're having your stress
24:07 dream one through ten huh I guess you're
24:12 right but that's not really what we
24:15 would call a meaning right it's a cause
24:20 of a mechanical thing but maybe it is
24:23 what meeting means but what other people
24:27 are trying to do is incorporate
24:28 fortune-telling but try and incorporate
24:31 future events there are these folks that
24:36 have books and I went to the bookstore
24:37 probably in the early West late 80s when
24:40 I really started getting into dreamers
24:42 research books it's when I realized
24:45 there were dream clinics in the colleges
24:50 you know and colleges they want to know
24:53 what dreams are on a mechanical
24:57 biological level and you get a lot of
25:00 disinformation about this stuff the
25:03 whole REM stage of sleeping right REM is
25:07 random eye movement when and it's always
25:10 in Star Trek series Star Trek episodes
25:14 back in the day and you know you'll see
25:16 it all the time and shows where they I
25:17 think even stranger things at it whether
25:19 zoom in on a characters face and the
25:21 islands are going back and forth these
25:23 directors think it's so [ __ ] profound
25:25 these days it's a rim it's random eye
25:29 movement when they first postulated the
25:34 theory that all of your true mental rest
25:37 occurs during Delta phases which is when
25:42 you pass out of REM but all your dreams
25:45 occur during the REM stage they made a
25:50 lot of sci-fi episodes about it even
25:53 films that used incorporated this idea I
25:55 know that's not true right like I said
25:59 all the time and you're probably tired
26:00 of hearing it I dream in real time so
26:03 this morning when I was dreaming I had
26:06 to get up to go to a meeting
26:07 and you know I put my alarm just like
26:10 you a little bit ahead of time so I can
26:11 have like 15 minutes they're kind of
26:13 getting up and snooze a little bit my
26:15 reality going check my phone whatever
26:17 and this morning I was having just I've
26:21 had now for about four days straight the
26:25 most bizarre series of dreams which is
26:27 why I'm making this episode today where
26:30 I've got this place and it is
26:32 architectural II the same place and I
26:35 keep going to sleep at night without
26:37 doing anything special except for going
26:40 I'm going there right now you know but
26:42 even when I say I'm going there I've got
26:44 this hallway that's a part of the
26:47 structure that this world takes place in
26:50 and I just keep going back but this
26:56 morning I woke up and set my line five
26:59 minutes early five minutes you know from
27:01 five minutes news basically and I rolled
27:06 over and closing my eyes and boom the
27:07 alarms going off again
27:08 but I realized I had to add a five
27:11 minute in fact it wasn't even five
27:12 minutes it was probably just a quick
27:18 little you know fall back into that
27:21 realm messed around very quickly and
27:24 then POW it's five minutes later okay
27:26 but now how could dreams have meanings
27:31 what do we mean by meaning now we're
27:36 obviously plugged into the universe as I
27:37 lament in many many episodes so the idea
27:40 is that maybe there is more going on
27:45 than meets the eye
27:46 of course right we don't know exactly
27:50 where we are we don't know if we have a
27:54 creator or not most of us I think have a
27:57 hunch about that every premonition I've
28:02 ever had has been when I was completely
28:05 awake
28:07 huge huge things even verbalizing it
28:12 once to a housewife and then the event
28:15 occurs verbalizing it the night before
28:17 9/11 telling my girlfriend I think
28:19 something horrible is about
28:20 to happen and it's going to involve
28:22 planes I didn't say planes hitting
28:25 buildings I saw two commercial jumbo
28:28 jets fly in opposite directions in a
28:33 fully lit room with a white ceiling the
28:37 second after I said I feel like
28:38 something really horrible is about to
28:40 happen and I saw two planes do this they
28:43 go in like this just right about the
28:46 ceiling where I was the night before
28:48 9/11 how right I do explain it in my
28:55 time-travel episode but the idea is sort
28:59 of romantic one goes to sleep and again
29:04 like I always say always ask yourself
29:06 why do we have to sleep why do we all
29:11 have to why don't we have a biological
29:12 clock the standard answer for millennia
29:16 has been because you're tired of course
29:19 you've got to go to sleep can't you feel
29:20 yourself getting tired no I'm like yeah
29:22 but why am I getting tired if I sit on
29:26 my ass all day you know those are those
29:28 days every like one day a year you got
29:31 the day off you're not surrounded by
29:33 your kids or your wife or your husband
29:35 you got the day off to yourself and you
29:39 just sit around and you're a lazy mf'er
29:43 so why are you tired in twelve hours
29:47 usually right when you finally drag your
29:50 ass out of bed or are you tired at the
29:52 same exact time you just goofed off all
29:55 day your body you know this will be a
29:57 day when you're not sick you have no
29:58 injuries you're not that old well what
30:02 do you got to do you know like they'll
30:03 say that you have to go to sleep to file
30:05 away your long-term memory the long-term
30:09 memory databank cache buffer that you've
30:13 acquired all day oh really what [ __ ]
30:16 scientists figured that one out right
30:18 well what did you do did you map the
30:21 subconscious and the conscious together
30:22 like little electrons and you watch this
30:24 little data packet turns for happen you
30:26 watch the the backup Drive going no they
30:31 made that [ __ ] up it's a hunch and
30:34 have no problem with hunches okay that's
30:37 what this whole show is or it's a hunch
30:38 it's funny how you have that passed
30:41 around because it's dismissive right a
30:44 bad theory unchallenged becomes a
30:48 solution becomes disinformation becomes
30:52 the mechanism by which you close your
30:53 mind and you never open it back up again
30:55 I don't know how you can get any worse
30:59 than that
31:00 for society right so in my opinion if
31:04 you work your ass off on a construction
31:06 site all day you're working around the
31:08 house a lot you're fixing your car
31:09 you're vacuuming you're cleaning
31:11 sorting out the pantry the tool chest or
31:14 whatever yeah at night your body should
31:17 just go poof back right in that bed
31:20 intentionally I mean I could rationalize
31:22 that one but if you sit around you know
31:26 sometimes sometimes you'll be on
31:27 vacation yeah two days you get up you
31:32 take a shower if you'll totally awake
31:34 you feel wonderful
31:35 you put your shorts on your sandals on
31:39 your flip-flops or whatever the hell put
31:42 a top on off your girl grab your towel
31:44 you go down to the beach the pool and
31:46 you do nothing all day and you know that
31:49 the Sun will heat you up and make it a
31:51 little bit tired but in the end your
31:53 brain has this rhythm and so we're also
31:59 made out of all this double helix stuff
32:00 like I always say okay if the reason why
32:04 I'm going on about this is it seems like
32:06 there's a design intent and I was having
32:09 to sleep
32:12 everything sleeps we're wondering where
32:16 we are
32:17 well if our operating system continually
32:19 gets updated then perhaps there's
32:23 something that's bigger going on
32:29 meaning hmm
32:31 I have extremely vivid dreams I'll meet
32:34 prints and a dream and hang out with him
32:36 all night long I will make music with
32:40 that guy
32:40 I had a prince dream I had which I
32:43 didn't have a time when he was alive a
32:45 couple we were in a studio together
32:48 these other people it was like a normal
32:51 day like he's got his engineers and his
32:53 other musicians in there and but we are
32:55 hanging out this is not a day where he's
32:57 gonna be pounding out an album and he's
32:59 sort of there as a friend and he just
33:01 says to me he looks just like the badass
33:04 dude he is and he's like you know bigger
33:05 than life kind of guy he's sitting there
33:08 with the guitar and he's kind of looking
33:09 at me and he's like it's like what do
33:12 you want to do let's try to make some
33:14 music man you know or I'll try to help
33:17 you make something because you don't
33:18 need any help he goes okay well I goes
33:20 let me because I'm working on a bunch of
33:22 [ __ ] let me just play a few things I got
33:24 working in the vault here and you see if
33:28 you can do something with it sing to it
33:29 put another instrument on it so you can
33:31 get me over the hump of where this could
33:33 go
33:33 and he plays this amazing beat and he
33:37 starts playing the guitar on it you know
33:39 and I'm just like damn first I'm just
33:41 stunned I'm just stunned at the amazing
33:44 nature of this music another dream I had
33:48 was being at Paisley Park after he died
33:52 and there's a sound engineer and they're
33:54 going well we got a bunch of songs were
33:58 gonna release that are fully complete
34:00 Prince songs some songs need to be
34:02 polished where we got all of his lyrics
34:04 and everything and his various tracks we
34:06 had to clean up to figure out kind of
34:08 how he would have finished the
34:09 arrangement of this because we have more
34:11 tracks of just beats and grooves and so
34:15 we're not sure what to do with just
34:16 beats and groove so he starts playing me
34:18 and groove
34:20 and I started singing to it and you know
34:22 of course the one weird thing that
34:24 happens in dreams for me personally as
34:26 if I sing it to me it is like godly I
34:31 mean it is like angels singing it is
34:33 something so divine and so perfect when
34:35 I sing in a dream it's a weird thing I
34:38 never sing in a dream and it's like well
34:41 that was bad you know I'm I'm out of
34:43 tune or what am i singing what are these
34:45 lyrics what is this melody it's never
34:47 that it's always like an 11 to a 20 on a
34:50 scale of 1 to 10 but the meaning model
34:54 sort of implies a bit of sort of a dream
34:58 astrology right astrology really
35:03 insinuates and you know hey I haven't
35:06 had any success with this I don't anyone
35:08 who had anyone who has got people that
35:11 say they believe in it but then when I
35:13 asked them why they believed in it and
35:16 what are the huge proof positives they
35:18 don't really have anything for me it's
35:21 always a bummer why can't I find some
35:25 you know some person was like 160 IQ
35:27 they tell me how astrology works right
35:29 but it would seem that if there's a
35:32 meaning model then the universe has some
35:34 sort of ecosystem of sort of
35:40 inspirational decoding or even forget
35:45 inspirational sorry that's probably the
35:46 wrong emphasis and fastest we have these
35:54 implies that the universe is giving us
35:56 messages to figure out ourselves well if
35:59 you dream of this then it's the universe
36:01 saying you know maybe when you wake up
36:03 you should kiss your loved one if you
36:06 dream of this that means you don't need
36:08 to you need to take your life more
36:10 seriously or whatever go take a bath go
36:13 wash your car whatever right I had a
36:16 book I probably donated it because I've
36:17 donated a ton of my books in the last
36:19 five years because I just got too many
36:22 but it was full of a bunch of meanings
36:26 and you just it was like a dictionary
36:28 you just looked up objects and it gave
36:32 you the meaning of that object
36:33 and I thought well that's really weird
36:36 how could you possibly create a noun
36:39 based book because that's what it was
36:42 everything was a noun in there and
36:44 simply say if you see a tree it's maybe
36:48 I'm making this up okay maybe it's a
36:50 sign of wisdom the tree lives for a long
36:54 time it sees mankind come and go you
36:56 know if a tree is a thousand years old
36:58 criminy there's the Joshua trees that
37:01 are supposed to be 4,500 years old
37:03 they're 2,000 years older or 2,500 years
37:06 older than the fabled Christ of titus
37:11 flavius who really lived in Christ time
37:13 it's amazing right according to the
37:17 revised history of Egypt you're talking
37:19 about a tree that was born I don't know
37:22 within a thousand years of the pyramids
37:24 being completed that's pretty amazing
37:25 right it couldn't possibly be in my
37:29 opinion a generic situation of a tree
37:32 means the same thing to me as it means
37:33 to you but that's what these books
37:34 attempt to do but now what else do we
37:38 say about dreams in most cases it's
37:41 built out of your life experiences right
37:46 but then there's this weird wild card
37:48 that shows up the Joker card shows up in
37:50 that you once you can pull this thread
37:54 out of the sweater in terms of
37:56 conception like I said when I was nine
38:00 years old I saw a King Kong movie I
38:02 think the one where he's on the Chrysler
38:04 Building and then immediately dreamed of
38:06 a much smaller King Kong tearing up my
38:09 neighborhood like rampage those of you
38:12 mentioned rampage after that episode you
38:16 have to know right when I was saying I
38:17 was thinking about rampage which is a
38:19 video game where you're a bunch of
38:21 monsters just tearing the crap out of
38:23 buildings and competing for the most
38:25 damage the two-player game I believe
38:29 long before I saw Close Encounters of
38:33 the Third Kind but that was ever made
38:36 the toys in my room attacked me as a kid
38:39 at specifically four years old three and
38:42 four had these dreams of my toys coming
38:46 at me on the on the floor they never got
38:49 up over the sheets and onto the bed by
38:52 god they were right there next to my bed
38:53 and for me it was freaking me up my dad
38:58 showed me some scary movies when I was a
39:00 kid to my knowledge none of them were
39:04 toy related there was a little Tasmanian
39:10 African doll if you've seen that movie
39:13 and I forgot what it was it's just it's
39:15 this African warrior statue thing and
39:19 has a necklace on it and it's feeble is
39:21 don't take the necklace off because then
39:22 he comes alive and the wife loves the
39:24 necklace so she takes it off and there's
39:26 little son of a [ __ ] runs around the
39:28 house yelling this little you know
39:31 tribal chant and stabbing the [ __ ] out
39:33 of her she lives in the end but man it
39:36 takes forever to kill this thing that
39:39 freaked the [ __ ] out of me but it could
39:42 it be that the the creators of the
39:43 universe of predisposed certain iconic
39:47 symbols to mean something for all of us
39:54 I'm gonna say none so what's left I mean
39:58 I hate to just walk away from it but
39:59 think about it how could a I don't know
40:04 I'm trying to think of something that's
40:05 a profound now in any of my dream since
40:07 I remember them all you know I don't
40:10 have the I really don't have the same
40:14 dream people most the time they're a
40:16 certain group of people that I've been
40:18 dreaming about for the last four days
40:20 that are sweet wonderful people my
40:22 family has been in my dreams you know so
40:28 what I would say is the theme of my
40:30 world and when I dream is that one the
40:33 universe itself will renew randomly as
40:37 far as I can tell such that my mind will
40:41 create a place it could be a small city
40:44 I will probably consume four or five
40:49 city blocks some have really tall
40:52 skyscrapers I'm involved in where I'll
40:54 go up 50 stories if not higher to some
40:58 really cool office spaces up there
40:59 sometimes recently my my dreams have
41:03 been inside buildings that are about
41:05 three to four stories high like sort of
41:07 a big high school back in the you know
41:10 the old days when they built them up and
41:11 that flat
41:13 people are just wonderful and warm
41:16 everyone means everyone well seems like
41:19 we're always productive we're always
41:20 kind of doing something but I couldn't
41:21 tell you what it was it's like we always
41:24 have to go from one place to another
41:26 okay everybody let's go and you want to
41:28 use your car okay yeah sure
41:30 and the car comes with its own
41:32 difficulty sometimes I'm trying to find
41:35 some common denominator between people
41:38 that don't dream and people that do
41:40 dream and it it's not necessarily
41:46 because there's two common denominators
41:47 you could have that in my opinion you
41:49 could get to one of the common
41:53 denominators relates to why you don't
41:55 dream I mean you probably are dreaming
41:57 but you don't just don't remember it I
41:59 dearly hope that's the case the second
42:02 would be what would be the ramification
42:05 if you didn't drink
42:07 now in the Star Trek episode here's a
42:11 couple where rim sleeps not happening I
42:16 want to see it was Janeway but then
42:17 again I think I remember Riker having
42:19 the problems maybe it was next
42:21 generation I think it was one where
42:22 Janeway had an aliens on board her ship
42:25 and they were in some frequency that
42:27 couldn't be visualized and they were
42:29 messing with everywhere I co was the one
42:31 that had the dream where he was on a
42:34 table so I guess it was next generation
42:36 where he kept having like pains in his
42:39 body pains in his temple and it's
42:43 because they had devices hooked up to
42:45 their bodies penetrating their bodies
42:47 one person seemed to have their leg cut
42:49 off and reattached it was like because
42:52 the doctor figured that out so they
42:53 weren't quite dreaming something real
42:55 was happening to them right but the
42:57 ramification that they implied during
43:00 this episode is if you don't Rim you
43:02 know I have random eye movement which is
43:04 a very short period of your dream stage
43:06 according to dream clinics and you know
43:07 you got to believe in there watching
43:09 people on the videotape and compare
43:11 notes across the world that you simply
43:14 don't wake up with any sense of feeling
43:16 rested some people sleep really well and
43:21 they fall asleep very easily what I have
43:26 found is the people that fall asleep
43:27 very easily tend to be the people that
43:30 do not dream and I know this from having
43:34 girlfriends right I do not fall asleep
43:38 easily my brain absolutely never shuts
43:43 down it is a curse I've had since I
43:47 think I was I was literally I had just
43:51 moved to Derby Kansas as a kid it was
43:53 nine years old
43:55 I was having a lot of growing pains and
43:58 I grew very quickly as a child
44:00 my legs hurt my arms hurt it was like
44:03 everything was hurting and so that was
44:06 part of why getting to sleep was tough
44:08 but then it was just I don't know if
44:11 that kicked off my brain turned to deal
44:13 with the pain because Benny I I still
44:16 kind of remember it to this day you're
44:19 the weird thing happened when I was a
44:20 kid was that I was a little kid probably
44:23 from the age of like 7 - I don't know 10
44:27 I constantly had athlete's foot what
44:31 between my toes it's just a pain in the
44:35 butt I think they had just changed out
44:38 of cotton socks to polyester socks and
44:40 that's when your foot stayed wet all the
44:44 time something gross I was just dealing
44:46 with these things at night you know and
44:48 I think that just may have started
44:50 kicking my brain off I hadn't received
44:52 my encyclopedia or Wide World
44:57 Encyclopedia and so I was in my late 90s
45:00 and that's when I really started digging
45:03 into academia up until 9
45:07 I had no special anything I mean I was a
45:10 little kid I you know I had a
45:12 motorcycles a big deal a little bit of
45:14 you know hand-eye coordination there I
45:17 played video games really really well
45:18 like I play adults and kick their asses
45:20 when I was a little kid that was pretty
45:21 fun by the way just a UH digression
45:25 video games - kicking adults asses my
45:28 father and I used to play this
45:29 battleship game on the Intellivision
45:32 which was not like battleship the board
45:34 game it was like you had some continents
45:36 and you would make your destroyer or
45:39 your aircraft carrier whatever it was
45:41 and it was a point where I click the
45:44 right button and I got this debug mode
45:46 going and my ship was black all the
45:49 ships were colors and my ship was black
45:51 and I had an infinite range on my ship
45:55 remember I was stupid and I blew the
45:58 [ __ ] out of my dad's last ship and so I
46:01 won the game instead of holding back as
46:04 an adult and going holy [ __ ] I got this
46:05 thing into like debug mode
46:07 I got this like infinitely strong ship
46:11 really funny but that's last time I dad
46:13 ever played me cuz I just wiped him out
46:14 I can't say that any my friends I got
46:18 two friends that don't drink but I know
46:20 if we talk about it one is constantly
46:24 stressed cannot deal with their career
46:28 it greatly inhibits their life and even
46:33 though they're constantly in drama they
46:36 don't want it and I got another friend
46:38 it doesn't dream and that friend's cool
46:41 is a cucumber and I mean just as relaxed
46:45 as could be happy and maybe he's hiding
46:48 it on the inside but I doubt it but now
46:51 let's say that there was a mechanism of
46:53 the gods like a Zeus type God system a
46:56 Greek guy system where there are these
46:58 nouns that mean things
47:01 hmm well since we don't have a manual
47:05 down here that would mean that these
47:07 symbols are sort of a hush-hush secret
47:10 or psychic you and Nan thing where you
47:12 got to figure it out you had to figure
47:15 it out well what did you dream about
47:17 last night well i dreamed about a
47:18 unicorn taking a crap on an ice cream
47:21 cone
47:22 it had sprinkles on it and then i i swam
47:27 in the ocean till i found a gold coin
47:30 floating on the top of the ocean okay
47:33 well how did your life go in the next 10
47:35 days well you know I won the lottery and
47:37 got a great job I found a hundred-dollar
47:39 bill on the ground okay and then they
47:42 asked 20 other people who have at least
47:45 those nouns in their dream however the
47:47 scenario goes and they're like oh my god
47:50 unicorn poop that means gold coins that
47:53 means fortune okay someone writes that
47:58 down then it goes in this lexicon of
48:00 things that your dream means well I'm
48:04 gonna say that book hasn't been really
48:06 printed as much as I bought a book in
48:08 the late 80s that sort of has something
48:10 like that there's a difference between
48:11 having that book and have it a bunch of
48:14 people buy it start analyzing their
48:17 dreams and realizing oh my god
48:20 I turned about you know X minus Z equals
48:22 one two three and I looked it up in the
48:25 book and I'll be damned my whole life
48:27 went that route for those of you guys
48:31 that have played a video game for a day
48:33 you played World of Warcraft for a day
48:35 you played command & Conquer for a day
48:37 whatever it is you're playing then you
48:40 go to sleep could be one of these clash
48:42 of Clan games for all you know did you
48:45 go to sleep and you start dreaming they
48:46 met the mechanism of that game and it's
48:50 swapping like Groundhog Day that
48:54 typology of your dream is swapping I
48:57 don't know your your job goes into a
49:01 clash of clans thematic game system or
49:06 Warcraft game system and so you kind of
49:10 have reality mixed with fantasy and
49:12 you're going in this circle where you're
49:14 trying to solve a problem there's an
49:17 interesting piece of advice which I
49:19 completely agree with which is don't go
49:21 to bed angry especially at your spouse
49:24 or your boyfriend girlfriend whatever
49:26 your partner in life I think it's pretty
49:30 generic don't go to bed angry why is
49:34 that why is that a saying where did we
49:38 get sayings sayings are part of wisdom
49:44 sayings are usually because Society has
49:46 paid a price over and over and over
49:48 again and the wisest souls I paid
49:51 attention to these patterns and they're
49:54 trying to give us a little saying to
49:57 keep us from paying the price an
50:00 unresolved issue for me he turns into
50:02 some level of a frustration dream if
50:05 it's significant enough
50:08 I've got techniques in my consciousness
50:11 realm the super $0.05 realm that I use
50:14 to make sure I don't go to bed like that
50:16 as much as possible like I've said
50:19 several shows I will talk it out with
50:21 myself what do you think I practice
50:25 through these shows
50:27 but I'll talk it out I'll talk it out
50:29 loud and be like I'll talk to God you
50:31 know I'll be like what is the deal why
50:33 am I having this weird angsty feeling in
50:34 my chest is because I drink some coffee
50:37 at 10 o'clock at night is it the way I
50:40 wrote something on the Internet is it
50:43 something that I said to someone why am
50:47 I feeling this way and I will tell you
50:50 without exaggeration nine times out of
50:52 ten I can figure out what it is maybe
50:55 even higher and you know at some point
51:00 you go okay alright well that person's
51:02 asleep right now I need to really kind
51:05 of make amends or something or clarify
51:08 or or I'll just blow it off and go okay
51:10 well probably best I don't say anything
51:13 at all
51:13 could be that I just need to not drink
51:16 coffee late at night not your not eat
51:18 sugar late at night not eat too many
51:22 habaneros but let me go for some
51:25 low-hanging fruit it's biological the
51:30 amount of times and I've alluded to this
51:33 and I think I've put it on point a
51:34 couple times in previous dream episodes
51:36 but the amount of times that I have had
51:37 to I drink a lot of water before I go to
51:39 bed a friend of mine told me a trick
51:41 maybe for those of you who are
51:43 struggling to dream but you used to
51:44 dream he told me he said look your brain
51:47 really functions well when it's hydrated
51:50 so if you really really really want to
51:53 dream make sure you're super hydrated
51:56 before you go to bed but what does that
51:59 cause biologically it means you have to
52:02 pee okay the amount of times I've had
52:08 dreams go south while I have to pee in
52:12 real life and I don't know what I'm
52:13 asleep I'm in a dream everything will be
52:16 going great in my dream and all the
52:18 sudden my body wants me to get up and go
52:21 take a leak and I will create what my
52:26 dream does and this is what's
52:27 fascinating about your brain or wherever
52:29 where these systems come from it does
52:32 seem very proprietary to us right is
52:35 that it will create drama so intense I
52:40 wake up
52:41 okay I think I shared in episodes going
52:45 to air soon here that I had a dream
52:47 where then I'll go back to the other
52:51 thing just a second but I had the heater
52:53 turn on in my house and you know when
52:56 your heater turns on a blows the cold
52:57 air on you first until the heat gets
52:59 from the vent to you and then you feel
53:00 better but it was really cold I think I
53:03 might have my heater down to 67 which
53:05 means it has to be 65 to turn on and
53:07 that it will heat it up - I think 68
53:10 before it shuts off and my back of my
53:13 neck was exposed and my hair up pushed
53:17 up and in the dream it had a zombie
53:21 nibble at my neck its teeth were cold
53:25 and that's what the cold air was and I
53:27 woke up going oh and I immediately felt
53:30 the cold air on my neck and I was like
53:31 holy [ __ ] my brain just made a zombie
53:34 bite my neck not really bite but attempt
53:38 to bite it was just kind of freaking me
53:39 out a little bit because of cold air on
53:41 the back of my neck I haven't had this
53:45 happen in a long time and I would say
53:46 maybe a year so but one of the things
53:49 that was frustrating with this
53:50 over-hydration thing and what I do now
53:53 is I hydrate long before bed like three
53:58 or four hours before bed get a lot of it
53:59 out of my system like the you gotta go
54:01 to restaurant right away get that on my
54:03 system and I can sleep much better but
54:06 it would take it would my dream would
54:09 introduce family members or people who
54:12 were very close to me and create an
54:14 argument like a really bad one like here
54:17 I'm saying things I would never say I'm
54:19 kind of like writing inside of a robot
54:21 of myself like a John being at John
54:23 Malkovich sort of situation and I wake
54:27 up and I'm like oh I took a leak and god
54:30 I hated that just now because what
54:32 happened just now is that I said things
54:35 to people that I love but I would never
54:36 ever say never ever think but my dream
54:40 was saying I'm gonna do whatever I can
54:42 to get you up because this has reached a
54:44 point of you know pain in your bladder
54:47 whatever right
54:50 but if I hadn't connected those two what
54:54 would I what might have I had done I
54:56 talked to a psychic or someone who's got
54:59 that book and they're like this means
55:01 you have problems with your dad or you
55:03 have your problems in your girlfriend or
55:04 whatever I just had to take a leak all
55:08 right doctors psychiatrists when they're
55:13 missing the biological connection
55:15 they'll go off and earn another years
55:17 worth of sessions with you because
55:19 you're bringing all those juicy Oedipus
55:23 complex stuff to your psychiatrist why a
55:27 close family member
55:29 probably because it's the fastest way to
55:32 escalate the situation in a personal way
55:36 when I had the thing on my neck it
55:38 didn't go after any family member it
55:39 simply brought something freaky probably
55:42 from it was actually kind of funny it
55:44 was it wasn't like a zombie from Walking
55:47 Dead or most video games it was like a
55:50 there was one giving you a game that it
55:51 was a zombie like this but it was forgot
55:54 the zombie game somebody made it like 20
55:57 years ago and it was like a zombie
55:58 wearing a sort of 50 suit and it was
56:03 like a funny zombie game 3d maybe some
56:07 of you guys won't remember what it was
56:08 it's like this episodic kind of fifties
56:13 mashup zombie game it was like that kind
56:18 of guy so it was kind of funny he was a
56:20 big dude this thing was like probably
56:21 six feet tall we're conscious living
56:25 beings right so what I don't understand
56:31 is when we're awake we have a very
56:33 consistent five-cent system meaning this
56:38 you wake up and you're in this world and
56:41 regardless of your life being different
56:43 than mine and your challenges being
56:45 different than mine on a daily basis
56:46 your geography is completely different
56:48 some people wake up to bombed-out cities
56:50 some people wake up to skyscrapers that
56:53 reach into the sky
56:55 pristine and beautiful opportunity
56:57 everywhere but when we go to sleep into
57:00 a dream those faculties are very
57:04 proportional to our own abilities to
57:06 dream again some people don't dream at
57:10 all
57:11 how's that possible why is that is there
57:16 something in their brain of a just the
57:18 too much fluoride you know I have a
57:20 friend of mine that doesn't dream and
57:21 that person does not use fluoridated
57:24 toothpaste does not drink aspartame does
57:26 not a GMO very much I mean very very
57:28 sound Diet why in fact that person I
57:33 think ingest more sugar before they go
57:35 to bed that any human being I know so
57:38 there should be a lot of calorie energy
57:40 flowing around inside their brain I used
57:44 to date someone who had panic attacks
57:45 panic attacks were directly proportional
57:48 to the amount of sugar this person ate
57:50 she would wake up and her chest would be
57:53 utterly pounding and I'd wake up and
57:55 just put my hand on her chest and I'm
57:59 always super calm super low blood
58:01 pressure and I would just use this voice
58:05 and talk her down talk her down I just
58:08 feel that heart slow down and slow down
58:11 and then she'd go right back to sleep
58:12 but I could tell you I we completely
58:15 mapped out to sugar intake she was
58:17 smaller as a human being so her body was
58:20 making incredible use of the sugar as a
58:23 calorie energy but she didn't if she
58:27 didn't work out or spend that energy in
58:29 some way one right to her brain now I'll
58:32 probably have released an episode called
58:34 observed reality or observe
58:36 consciousness excuse me before this one
58:38 I'll make sure I do these two maybe in a
58:40 two-pack release and it gets to a point
58:46 where you start to if you start to parse
58:51 your brain this is actually super
58:53 important
58:54 I did that episode and when after I did
58:57 the episode my my mechanism to parse my
59:01 own
59:03 chronology of a thought process right
59:06 and its physical location and geography
59:11 in the room with me is it's fascinating
59:13 how this occurs so now every day I have
59:16 a thought i parse where it's coming from
59:19 and it's gonna sound a little weird but
59:23 right now as I am forming this show I
59:25 feel like it's gonna sound funny okay I
59:28 feel like the show is in my head I'm
59:31 using my memory to paint the chronology
59:34 of what I want to talk about and I'm
59:37 merely scrolling down the image in my
59:39 brain of what I want to talk about and
59:41 it's only writing the next few seconds
59:45 in front of the dream and so in front of
59:47 the vision right but I feel like it's
59:48 inside me right now I don't know if it's
59:52 a cigar I don't know if it's the way the
59:53 format is how my brain is working to
59:55 make a show but that's where it's
59:56 geographically located in my brain in my
59:59 body and my consciousness but as soon as
60:03 I finish the show
60:05 there'll be different times of the day
60:07 when I feel like a thought approaches me
60:10 from the outside of my my realm of
60:14 existence my sole existence it comes up
60:17 to me from my up to my face and then
60:21 pushes into me and if I accept it you
60:30 guys can start doing this maybe you'll
60:32 start to figure out that thoughts come
60:35 from places perhaps outside of ourselves
60:37 right when we talk about we talk about
60:39 possession as much as I think a lot of
60:43 people go and there's no such thing as
60:45 possession because possession is an
60:47 invention of religion and religions are
60:48 all fake even if you believe that Christ
60:52 totally existed you may not accept the
60:54 Catholic Church's you know take on him
60:57 the Western version of Christianity
60:59 versus the Eastern version of
61:01 Christianity which is completely
61:02 different about what everything means
61:04 same events but they have a completely
61:05 different take on it go study it what
61:09 what I have found in the last I don't
61:12 know I want to say last 72 hours of my
61:15 life
61:16 is how recent this discovery is for me I
61:19 don't know I know this sounds weird but
61:21 I am finding that drama is coming from
61:26 the outside to me and stability and
61:29 rational thought is coming from inside
61:32 me out meaning I translate it into words
61:36 are translated into actions and deeds
61:38 when I see well when I experience drama
61:41 thoughts they're extremely visual it's
61:45 like someone's going up and showing me a
61:47 picture and going doesn't that piss you
61:51 off and what I do today as I go you know
61:56 I can see if I bought into your [ __ ]
61:59 yeah maybe but you know what I'm gonna
62:01 do I'm gonna ignore you I don't really
62:03 think you're my thought I think you're
62:05 coming from somewhere else and I don't
62:08 think I won't accept that thought and
62:10 you know what's funny you'll go from cuz
62:14 it'll catch you and I'm telling you what
62:17 I've noticed is notice this is just
62:19 siren coming just a little footnote my
62:23 house is about half a city block from
62:26 the local hospital and so that's why we
62:29 get sirens it's not that I live in a
62:31 super dangerous neighborhood quite the
62:33 opposite but what I find with these more
62:37 dramatic influential visions I could
62:40 call them is they come at me like boom
62:43 boom those like something is trying to
62:47 rile me up you know it's like the
62:50 [ __ ] on the playground that goes you
62:52 don't let them do that to you and trying
62:54 to get you all riled up they want to
62:55 other people to fight so they can sit
62:57 and watch and have a good time there's
62:59 been a lot of sci-fi shows that have
63:04 this theme of and it's part of the
63:07 reptilian theory that David Icke goes
63:09 into but I'm gonna mention the movie
63:12 branded one more time because I'll
63:14 probably continue to heartbeat this one
63:15 once a season at least
63:18 the notion of possession is a little bit
63:22 different and then it's a complete usurp
63:24 ssin of your body and mind for their
63:26 deeds and so that's when you know the
63:29 Exorcist movie starts to occur I dearly
63:33 hope that's a very rare occasion but one
63:36 of the definitions I had of the devil
63:38 after I wrote this book when I was in my
63:40 early actually my late teens was that
63:44 the devil is probably not trying to make
63:46 you do big giant things like run a van
63:48 into a bunch of people the devil is
63:50 probably just whispering in your ear
63:53 getting you do the little things that
63:55 you shouldn't do bunch of little things
63:57 equal a bunch of bad things right it
63:59 could be just simply distracting you
64:00 away from your natural talents it is the
64:05 little Yago and your ear that tries to
64:07 make you think that someone's being
64:09 unfaithful to you or something right
64:11 when they're totally totally legit
64:14 they're not doing anything against you
64:16 at all or something right you have this
64:17 when you're a little kid usually you
64:18 have first relationships but I'll find
64:21 that you know at times will be this
64:23 little bombardment and lately I've just
64:27 been going no sorry sorry get out of my
64:31 way
64:31 get out of my way no you're not a part
64:33 of me you have nothing to do with me
64:34 just get away right and then what's
64:37 beautiful is what you were doing before
64:39 these stupid thoughts might have been
64:41 pushed at you is that you regain
64:44 complete compiz their composure and
64:46 control you just go about your life and
64:48 it goes from being oh I almost got
64:50 emotional for a split second and now I'm
64:52 totally fine because I did a conscious
64:54 rejection of what appears to be in feels
64:58 to be something external trying to
65:01 become internal their subconscious mind
65:04 gets validated as existing in modern
65:08 science and psychology and maybe it's
65:13 there maybe it's not there but there's
65:15 this movie called branded or any of
65:18 you've seen it you're know right where
65:19 I'm going fortunately our folks haven't
65:22 seen it it is a movie I believe filmed
65:25 in Russia it's sort of an indie movie
65:26 but it has a lot of really has two
65:29 things that make it sort of
65:31 not an indie movie it has some
65:34 incredible actors in fact the priest
65:37 from Exorcist who's actually now old he
65:40 was in dreamscape as well he's in there
65:43 as a broker for what appears to be at
65:48 first maybe the devil and turns into
65:50 aliens but also has incredible is an
65:55 incredible budget some people looked at
65:58 the special effects and said oh that
65:59 that's proof there's not a big budget
66:01 behind this and I'm telling you they did
66:03 these aliens exactly the way they should
66:05 have looked I don't think they spared
66:07 any experience whatsoever they met their
66:08 target hundred percent it's not on point
66:12 exactly what I'm talking about but the
66:15 way the movie goes the premise of it is
66:18 that and you have to have a setup
66:20 somehow so you want to go see it but
66:23 invisible to our to our eyes until you
66:26 can see it just like they live it's sort
66:28 of alien they live except they don't
66:32 look grossed these aliens are not some
66:33 weird you know H R Giger bladder
66:37 swimming in the air or something
66:39 the aliens are these really interesting
66:41 ornate shapes kind balloons that have
66:46 some organic nature to them they have
66:48 beautiful patterns on them they're
66:49 pretty they look like they've been
66:51 designed okay but their whole goal is to
66:55 distantly feed on the desires of man
67:00 just the desires of men they don't feed
67:03 on the acquisition of the desire what
67:08 does that mean there's one scene in the
67:11 movie I'll tell you that is something
67:14 that I think about when I think about
67:15 this sort of no interference pattern now
67:20 I should say at the same time there was
67:23 a Freedom of Information Act request to
67:26 the United States intelligence agency
67:28 for some paperwork and according to RT
67:32 comm which is a Russian based news
67:34 organization they leaked out
67:37 accidentally or released out the overall
67:40 mind control that I've been talking
67:43 about for years
67:44 we're cellphone towers are used to
67:46 manipulate the minds of human beings now
67:50 people who are familiar with cellphone
67:51 towers jump in this conversation ago
67:53 that's impossible the frequencies of the
67:55 brain and the frequencies of these
67:56 towers are completely different okay a
68:00 little little education on electronics
68:04 if you have something that runs on
68:08 electricity yes there's resistors and
68:11 capacitors and stuff that regulate
68:13 certain frequencies that are capable in
68:15 these circuits but you can change the
68:16 frequency of usually any radio frequency
68:18 device to either go really low medium or
68:22 really high and so they can simply
68:25 change the power that goes through these
68:27 systems to affect you as well a lot of
68:32 folks that are so sure about what are in
68:34 these microchips have no [ __ ] clue
68:36 what are in these microchips okay with
68:39 the one example I gave in my show
68:40 probably two years ago that I had never
68:44 seen any documentation talk about
68:45 Gnostic reality okay I mean I dragged it
68:49 out of the universe as an inventor
68:52 myself and the implications of this
68:54 someone could park a van outside your
68:56 house and hit you with a transmitter and
69:02 give you I think they could probably
69:04 only give you fairly obtuse feelings of
69:07 panic or calmness or whatever again if
69:10 they want to create another false flag
69:12 to the degree of the ones that we've
69:15 seen I just put a key word in the old
69:18 index there they could either make you
69:22 feel more terrified to give you more
69:24 trauma so they can program you more so
69:26 as you turn the TV to figure out what's
69:27 going on or they could make you feel
69:30 more calm if they're committing a crime
69:31 that they want you to accept and because
69:34 they have a global network of intentness
69:36 all around the world to facilitate your
69:38 phone this could be something that
69:41 explains why some of us might be
69:43 noticing various emotional things seem
69:46 to be coming from an external source
69:47 that's a little far-fetched but you know
69:50 just keep your eyes open for everything
69:52 so I'm telling you the branded has a
69:55 scene
69:57 it's a beautiful cosmetic scene it's in
69:59 Russia one of these beautiful old towns
70:02 that's kind of like a I don't know it's
70:05 like looks like it could be in France in
70:09 Paris and all these interesting little
70:10 cobblestone streets but there's no one
70:12 else in the street and there's this
70:13 woman it was pretty gorgeous and she has
70:16 this fat little kid who's like an
70:19 Augustus gloom kind of kid from Willy
70:20 Wonka the more modern one and the kid
70:24 wants an ice cream cone because there's
70:25 a guy selling the most delicious looking
70:27 ice cream cones and he keeps begging his
70:30 mother and begging his mother and of
70:31 course she's looking at her fat kid
70:32 going you know last [ __ ] thing you
70:34 need is another ice cream cone but he
70:37 begs and begs needs becomes a big pain
70:38 in the ass and so she caves in and he's
70:42 looking at this ice cream cone he slow
70:44 down time as I remember it and this
70:46 thing is attached to the back of his
70:48 neck it's like a little tiny balloon at
70:50 first literally like a balloon but it's
70:52 got a little checkered pattern on it the
70:54 checkered pattern matches the larger
70:56 alien that is floating above there's
70:57 going to consume what the boys about to
71:00 manufacture which is desire and the more
71:04 he looks at this that balloon gets
71:07 bigger and bigger and bigger fills up
71:09 when the bottom of his spine on his neck
71:11 right his vertebrae it fills up with
71:15 this desire in a second this is what's
71:17 brilliant about this movie
71:18 the second the kid gets the ice cream
71:21 cone and pulls it up to his mouth okay
71:24 the blue is reaching its apex of
71:26 inflation as soon as he takes a bite of
71:29 it it separates from his neck and that
71:32 balloon full of that desire floats up to
71:35 the mother alien and joins and it's like
71:37 oh I got some more it didn't stick
71:41 around for the consumption of the ice
71:43 cream because the desire is no longer
71:46 really there it's being satiated by the
71:48 ice cream interesting right one of the
71:52 most terrifying notions about possession
71:55 of an alien that we can't see I'm just
71:59 gonna lean on like maybe
72:03 I want to see the reptilian theory but
72:05 that goes all the way into like full
72:06 possession and shape-shifting also their
72:08 crap I don't buy any of that stuff but
72:12 if something was feeding off of our
72:14 desires feeding off of our incredible
72:18 emotions then what would that invisible
72:24 race attempt to do with men it would
72:29 attempt to create as many wars as
72:30 possible
72:31 what kind of wars you might immediately
72:35 envision World War three but you don't
72:38 want to kill all of your subjects right
72:40 you don't want to kill you wouldn't buy
72:42 a bunch of batteries to power something
72:45 and then hit them all with hammers and
72:47 destroy them you wouldn't want to put
72:49 them in a circuit that eats them up in
72:51 two seconds so you gotta go get more
72:53 batteries keep your batteries around
72:55 using your batteries okay so maybe the
73:00 war is we're talking about here are the
73:02 wars that have to do with the wars
73:06 between each other I'm convinced by a
73:10 particular group of people that you're a
73:12 racist and I figured out a way to get it
73:14 offended oh isn't that the name of the
73:17 game these days right you get butthurt
73:19 and more butthurt you get the more [ __ ]
73:21 you think you're gonna get from free cuz
73:23 you're extorting behavior out of other
73:25 people well you offended me I get
73:26 something for free men what our
73:29 politicians are doing right now who are
73:30 part of the deep state trying to get out
73:32 of this problem
73:32 they're going around and promising
73:34 everyone things but also promising them
73:36 and telling them how broken they are and
73:38 how destroyed they are because of
73:40 somebody else the haves and the
73:41 have-nots they're all trying to be false
73:43 robin hood's if your dreams are a
73:47 byproduct of your current thought
73:49 structure in your current adoption of
73:51 various paradigms then I think it's also
73:54 equally important that you manage the
73:57 ecosystem of your thoughts you have to
74:01 know where they're coming from maybe
74:03 their inner demons or whatever maybe we
74:06 have this inner child but I've referred
74:09 to several times in the Freudian
74:12 you know days of yesteryear maybe it's
74:15 just infectious between men we share
74:18 thoughts we do so if you got a guy
74:21 that's convinced you convince one dude
74:22 that he's been wronged and he gets with
74:26 people like himself because that's what
74:28 we do in this world all right maybe you
74:33 can easily infect and indoctrinate the
74:34 person sitting right next to you to
74:36 think that they are convinced one black
74:38 person that all their problems in life
74:41 have to do with you know things that
74:43 happened two or three hundred years ago
74:44 that they're living the same life their
74:47 grandparents lived and the reason why
74:49 life is hard is because of all those but
74:52 people are being racist I'm sure it
74:53 doesn't help we know it exists to some
74:55 degree in everywhere against everyone
74:57 right if you want to have wonderful
75:00 dreams I think you have to balance your
75:03 life and I think if you're not having
75:07 dreams my advice would be and this is
75:10 what I say to my friends when you go to
75:12 bed if you're a person that just hits
75:15 that pillow and you're out this is
75:17 really hard for you to do because a
75:18 you're getting hopefully fantastic sleep
75:21 hopefully get a shit-ton better sleep
75:23 and I get I get pretty good sleep these
75:25 days I mean I feel wonderful when I wake
75:27 up after these dreams especially I feel
75:29 like I want on a vacation it's crazy
75:32 one of the tricks I had just to finish
75:35 up on this note of trying to incubate
75:38 dreams if you don't have it right or
75:40 used to have them you don't have anymore
75:43 one of the rules I found and I think I
75:45 may have said this a long time ago which
75:47 is if I thought of things when I went to
75:49 bed that were real real people in the
75:52 real world real situations I could never
75:54 go to sleep even exciting things I'm
75:57 building a piece of electronics and I'm
75:58 [ __ ] there's a multiplexer work again
76:01 and palpable bond I'm trying to think
76:02 this thing through oh yeah yeah and then
76:05 my brain was the next thing well now I
76:06 got the multiplexer fixed out let's
76:07 figure out we're gonna build and did it
76:08 okay that keeps me up keeps me up all
76:11 night no matter how tired I am and then
76:13 in an hour somebody's like okay screw it
76:15 get up get up and go do whatever the
76:17 hell you got to do cuz I'm not playing
76:19 this game anymore
76:20 one time I thought of they had seen
76:25 Roger the rabbits way back in the day
76:28 which I did not like that movie but you
76:30 know just not my type of foam but I
76:34 thought about being in that cartoon
76:35 world because it kind of went in and out
76:37 of the cartoon world and you went in the
76:38 cartoon world in the end of the film or
76:40 something I can barely remember it but I
76:42 remember visiting myself in that cartoon
76:45 world and I went right to bed
76:47 I remember just falling asleep and
76:48 thinking holy crap once they disengaged
76:50 from real life things I can get all
76:52 complex and $0.05 attached to once I
76:56 stopped trying to attach to $0.05
76:59 thoughts poem I'm off to sleep it's
77:02 crazy and now because I have such visual
77:05 memories of the last four days of my
77:07 life and it's been going on for months
77:08 but this one's been going on for four
77:10 days straight I just like right now I
77:12 see the place that I've been going to
77:15 and so now I'm gonna go to bed I think
77:18 about that place I think about walking
77:20 down this hallway and it has nothing to
77:22 do with this super duper detailed
77:24 reality and so my body just goes to
77:26 sleep hopefully some of you are using
77:29 this episode to get to sleep the other
77:31 one is to think about something that you
77:32 want to dream about you may not make it
77:35 happen but you might dream of something
77:37 else be cool if I was there trying to
77:42 make it to five cents right
77:43 I just went to Hawaii this room about
77:45 being back in Hawaii well you might
77:46 attach too much to it because it's part
77:49 of your reality recently think of
77:52 something like Star Wars like I'm a big
77:55 star Wars fan let's just say it's okay
77:57 you're on the Millennium Falcon you're
77:58 flying somewhere you're in a tent to
78:00 wean you're doing something you can't
78:02 $0.05 to ant to wean because you've
78:03 never been there
78:04 maybe that helps let me know in the
78:08 comments section your experience with
78:12 this notion of dreams having meanings
78:16 let me know your successes your failures
78:19 let me know what you think it is let me
78:22 know why you think we go to sleep I
78:24 haven't had any of you really comment on
78:26 that and please you know if you're gonna
78:29 give me the textbook reasons why you
78:32 could save your breath
78:33 unless the next thing you're gonna say
78:34 is and this is why I think this is
78:36 [ __ ]
78:37 okay we're here to think about things we
78:40 never thought about before push open
78:44 more real estate inside our world our
78:46 dream house right I think you feel me if
78:50 you haven't been a deep thoughts
78:51 radio.com please go there's video audio
78:54 locked Facebook group and the patreon
78:56 page I am putting out a ton of these
78:59 things you know they say not to do that
79:02 because you'll over saturate your market
79:04 you know get fatigued again this show is
79:06 more like a series of books and you may
79:11 not want to read the next volume right
79:13 now because you're reading the previous
79:14 one I mean I have the time to continue
79:17 the book series don't worry about it you
79:19 know the video sits there at 89 views
79:21 okay you know that one wasn't any good
79:24 or you'll get back to it when you it's a
79:26 rainy day you got a real long drive and
79:29 you'll just listen to it you know for
79:32 any of you who do use iTunes I would
79:36 encourage you guys to get up and do a
79:38 review if you dig the show because
79:39 that'll help us get the word out you
79:42 know subscriptions they come and they go
79:43 it's really strange
79:45 people are getting unsubscribe left and
79:47 right so beware that if you do like to
79:50 show and you think I haven't made an
79:51 episode in a long time after this
79:52 episode make sure you're still
79:54 subscribed the bells get undone a little
80:00 footnote for you guys the qa9 episode
80:06 was unpublished without me I'm
80:09 publishing it it was put in unlisted
80:10 mode I'm not sure how that would be
80:13 possible I don't go back and visit old
80:15 videos like I don't go back and edit
80:16 them and mess with them as soon as I've
80:18 moved it into the audio side of things
80:21 and copied the URL over into the audio
80:24 feed podcast I don't touch it anymore at
80:26 all so we must be over the target in
80:29 some of these realms and you know take
80:31 care of yourself in someone else that
80:33 I'll see in the next dream called deep
80:35 thoughts
