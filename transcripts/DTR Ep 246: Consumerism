00:35 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:37 gentlemen on this extremely warm
00:41 December day it's probably like eighty
00:43 two or three degrees here in California
00:46 which in December it's always the big
00:49 question of if we're gonna get a really
00:53 hot spell you know it's crazy we they
00:56 talk about all this global warming
00:57 [ __ ] and you know at night here it's
01:00 been 41 degrees roughly and during the
01:03 day it's been 85 degrees so in one day
01:08 in one 12-hour eight hour period or
01:10 whatever our temperature wavered 45
01:14 [ __ ] degree he's right and everyone
01:16 thinks that the world is gonna end if we
01:17 go up a quarter of a degree unbelievable
01:22 anyway it's not what we're gonna talk
01:24 about today today I'm going to talk
01:27 about a subject that I know a lot about
01:31 you've seen the title already
01:33 consumerism or what some schools call
01:37 conspicuous consumption why talk about
01:41 this well if you've ever been addicted
01:45 to buying stuff or you have a relative
01:48 that's been addicted to buying stuff and
01:50 this is probably just shy of hoarding of
01:53 course hoarding is a whole different
01:55 disorder which we're all trying to
01:57 desperately understand maybe I'll touch
02:01 on that as well
02:02 I have my own theories but it's the
02:04 process of buying things to be happy
02:07 buying things to measure yourself by in
02:12 relation to the rest of
02:13 society buying stuff because you've been
02:17 sold something about what will make you
02:19 happy by commercials and usually it's
02:23 it's always portrayed as you know you're
02:26 buying a big thing a big house a big car
02:28 something with a gigantic loan and
02:30 honestly you know that does happen but
02:33 those of you who have suffered from
02:36 either having this addiction yourself or
02:39 having a loved one that you love and you
02:41 see them painfully spending every dime
02:43 they have running up gigantic you know
02:46 credit debts going bankrupt on a routine
02:50 basis just as quick as the state will
02:52 allow them to go bankrupt but any of
02:55 you've dealt with that this is an
02:57 important subject to you and I have to
02:59 say if you're if you haven't run into
03:01 this there might be some wisdom that you
03:04 could share in the comment section to
03:06 kind of figure out why you don't have
03:08 this problem and some of you won't have
03:09 this problem because you've been through
03:11 it and which is what I think I have I
03:14 don't really have any SuperDuper history
03:16 of doing this but I've had family
03:18 members and friends of mine who have
03:20 nearly destroyed their marriages their
03:22 lives as a result of this addiction and
03:27 I'll tell you what I haven't seen anyone
03:29 buy their selves into happiness and so
03:36 when someone says that to you hey you
03:37 know money doesn't buy happiness and of
03:39 course we're not talking about being
03:40 destitute not being able to pay bills
03:42 the alternate world to consumerism is a
03:47 beautiful simplistic comfortable
03:51 survival and don't mean survival as in
03:54 you know you're just getting the minimum
03:56 amount of oxygen to stay alive
03:58 no no I'm talking about that it's
04:00 definitely a neutral comfort zone
04:01 between being impoverished and can't
04:04 afford to eat all the way up to you know
04:09 someone being blessed to have millions
04:12 and perhaps even more dollars and
04:14 spending it on everything that they
04:16 thought they ever wanted and the the the
04:21 perspective I'm going to be able to
04:22 bring you is sort of your normal middle
04:25 America ability to spin
04:27 become indebted to banks and credit
04:29 cards and what-have-you
04:30 all the way up to my colleagues and
04:34 close friends and even people I've dated
04:36 who have millions of dollars and have
04:40 had you know hundreds of millions of
04:42 dollars to spend to try and make
04:44 themselves happy I've seen it I've seen
04:47 it personally I've dated it you know and
04:52 the interesting thing is is I think most
04:55 of them if they had the opportunity to
04:57 get on YouTube and make it an episode
04:59 like this they would do it because they
05:02 have learned the hard way that it
05:04 doesn't really say she ate their life
05:09 okay and the reason to talk about it is
05:13 the reason to understand a little bit
05:14 more than just the surface problems with
05:16 the whole thing and it's really tough to
05:19 initially approach the idea it really is
05:21 you're kind of going to use what can I
05:22 do I don't wanna sound preachy or
05:24 whatever and I don't wanna say a bunch
05:26 of basically stupid obvious stuff not
05:29 stupid obvious but just painfully
05:30 obvious stuff right you'd be surprised
05:33 that farmers are some of the richest
05:35 people in small towns but they make
05:37 millions of it they spend millions and
05:39 so it kind of balances out you know they
05:41 don't and you never really go up to a
05:42 farmers place and find some super lavish
05:45 home you just don't they've got to buy a
05:47 gigantic combines and millions of
05:49 dollars worth of seed and all kinds of
05:52 wild you know labor force and stuff the
05:55 cool thing about the Midwest is that
05:57 when we're kids
05:57 they read us these Prairie books or at
06:00 least they used to when I was a kid in
06:02 the 70s and so we got to hear stories
06:05 about you know what it was like to
06:08 settle the Midwest back in the 1800s and
06:14 when you hear these stories you hear
06:16 about families that are utterly
06:18 destitute they're a fish out of water
06:22 there there is no true civilization yet
06:25 you know they're you know freshly
06:27 acquired land unfortunately from the
06:29 Native Americans and their farming and
06:32 going through all their stuff right
06:35 you know the only sugar they see is a
06:37 couple times a year one that's one of
06:38 the kids birthday birthdays or it's
06:40 Christmas or something and someone goes
06:42 in and gets literally like a cup of
06:43 sugar
06:44 so I can make one cake you know it's why
06:46 they didn't die with you know missing
06:48 teeth and so you get this amazing
06:51 bird's-eye view of what made them happy
06:55 and you know there's all kinds of
06:56 stories that that lament about how
07:00 simplicity can be the most amazing thing
07:02 and that's what I think we've lost sight
07:06 of once marketing departments pretty
07:09 much in the 20th century really started
07:12 getting their claws into folks and it
07:13 existed in the 19th century as well but
07:15 it without newspapers and radio and
07:21 television and movies
07:22 you weren't it they were not able to
07:24 penetrate us on so many levels as so
07:28 many intervals right think about the
07:31 average amount of advertising a child
07:33 sees in a three-hour session on Saturday
07:35 morning watching cartoons and then
07:37 compare that to what perhaps a year's
07:43 worth of advertising might have been for
07:45 grown adults and say 1880 in the Midwest
07:49 the child would win the race in three
07:52 hours being told you got to buy this and
07:55 you got to buy that right and that sort
07:58 of brings me to the other subject which
08:00 is if you're a single person you're
08:03 fighting the battle by yourself you're
08:07 fresh out of perhaps your parents house
08:09 you've maybe finished your college or
08:10 you're not going to go to college or
08:11 whatever and you're just chilling out
08:13 and you kind of built up some dreams
08:17 right and we see our lives usually in
08:19 decades we see our 0 to 10 in our brain
08:22 and 11 to 19 in our brain maybe we split
08:24 11 to 19 right around 13 because you
08:27 start you know hitting puberty or
08:28 whatever then you see your 20s near 30s
08:31 in your 40s that's just how you divide
08:32 up your life to essentially file away in
08:34 your filing cabinet of your brain the
08:36 experiences that you've had so in this
08:39 particular video I want you to view the
08:43 the lusts that you've built for items
08:46 pre teen years your teenage years and
08:50 then your twenties because it is really
08:53 those first I would say 20 years where
08:56 you start to build up your biases of
08:58 what cars are gonna be your favorite car
08:59 what clothing is your favorite clothing
09:01 you know you do develop new ones trust
09:04 me but then you start dating people and
09:09 sharing your space with people and and
09:12 one of the big giant levels of
09:13 compatibility that I think people are
09:14 becoming aware of is how addicted to
09:17 consumerism is this potential partner of
09:19 mine and you really need to sink that
09:22 [ __ ] up because if they want it a lot of
09:25 stuff and your content it'll be a
09:28 nightmare it'll be a nightmare trying to
09:32 push it all together and then you
09:34 finally find your mate and then you have
09:36 children now if you match up with your
09:39 mate well and you guys are either both
09:41 very simplified or you're both total
09:44 crazy consumers then your children are
09:48 going to invariably be exactly what you
09:50 are but if you're out of sync with your
09:52 spouse or your partner and you happen to
09:54 have a child then you might really have
09:58 a problem because your child will either
10:00 emulate you and one of the parents will
10:03 feel like oh my gosh you know now I feel
10:05 broken there's two of them and only one
10:07 of me you know one of the biggest
10:09 problems in society is the parent has a
10:11 huge has a really bad habit a lot of
10:15 cases I see it in obesity and the parent
10:18 wants the child to be obese so that
10:20 we're all in this club together
10:22 alcoholism is another one parent doesn't
10:25 know how to really grow up so drinking
10:27 alcohol is passed on to the child is
10:29 this is what it means to be an adult but
10:32 I want to put this really early in your
10:34 brain in this episode which is the
10:35 following there's all this talk about
10:39 slavery in history slavery oh I was a
10:43 slave you were owned slaves or whatever
10:46 to the degree you are addicted to having
10:52 something that you really don't need to
10:53 have your slave to it and it will
10:57 consume your time your thought your
10:59 money your mind I mean it is just it
11:02 could be all-consuming now for those of
11:04 you who struggle with drug addiction
11:05 man you you know this better than anyone
11:08 but I would say consumerism as a drug a
11:12 hundred percent there's a trigger in
11:15 your brain there's fires when you buy
11:17 something and then when you have it it's
11:21 nearly impossible to get that trigger to
11:24 fire one more time now there are
11:28 exceptions but I'm gonna go through a
11:31 few these items just to make sure you
11:33 understand people who I know who had
11:39 things that are outrageously amazing
11:42 very quickly fell out of love with those
11:46 amazing things and no matter how many
11:47 times they bought another one or
11:49 experienced something it just didn't
11:52 work it did not make them happy let's go
11:55 through for you these things now I'm
11:57 gonna start big and we're gonna go small
11:59 because I think when I say consumers and
12:00 most people think about the big items
12:05 big fancy cars men like it and women
12:11 like them and women like them the more
12:14 expensive the car is the more expensive
12:16 it is to maintain it and a lot of folks
12:21 have chances to upgrade from very
12:24 inexpensive cars fifteen to twenty
12:26 thousand dollar cars up to 60 to 100
12:29 thousand dollar car or even more and
12:31 they are utterly and completely shocked
12:34 of what it costs to put a license plate
12:36 on the car to change the oil change the
12:39 brakes to deal with an accident
12:42 I dated someone I mentioned in a
12:46 previous episode I go into her house and
12:54 I don't know anything that's coming in
12:57 this experience
12:58 and I go over to her place and it's a
13:01 very nice place in a very nice
13:02 neighborhood but nothing you know
13:03 tremendously amazing and she says to me
13:08 you know could you grab a box out of the
13:10 garage for me and take it upstairs cuz
13:13 my back's hurting me we're doing a lot
13:15 of lifting I just moved into this place
13:16 I said yeah sure no problem
13:18 so I go in the garage open the door and
13:21 there's a Lamborghini hurricane 2016 or
13:26 2015 excuse me staring right at me
13:29 and I'm look at this girl going what
13:32 like she's a single girl she'd been
13:35 married before very young younger than
13:37 me and she's got this 230 thousand
13:41 dollar car and the garage and so I just
13:45 she kind of looks at me and she goes
13:46 yeah you know I'm a car snob I really
13:49 like nice cars and so I'm looking at
13:52 looking at her going yeah you know I
13:54 have a lot of friends or car snobs too
13:56 but they don't own cars that cost you
13:58 know a third of my house you know take
14:00 the box upstairs over the course of
14:03 several months we dated and turns out
14:07 she had been married to a very wealthy
14:09 man
14:09 it's very intelligent woman wonderful
14:12 person and she had had access to money
14:15 on a level that I would say honestly of
14:20 all the people have had the privilege to
14:22 sit down with and talk to more money
14:25 than anyone I've ever talked to and I've
14:26 talked to people worth half a billion
14:28 dollars and and even more but I mean
14:31 I've met billionaires but you just say
14:32 hi she hands and they go away or you
14:34 don't sit around talking to him right
14:35 very much but she had more access here
14:38 access to more money than than any of
14:40 the people I know intimately meaning and
14:43 a good deep friendship and she was the
14:46 most educational person I've dated where
14:49 she taught me things she had been around
14:51 the world countless times been in places
14:54 that none of us can get access to just
14:56 due to you know you need a lot of wealth
14:58 to even take one day a vacation there
15:00 and she wasn't a person that flaunted it
15:04 really she liked to wear nice things and
15:06 she had a nice house and stuff but she
15:07 was sort of done with because she'd been
15:09 there she was able to purchase anything
15:11 she wanted in the world at any point in
15:13 time travel anywhere she wanted to at
15:15 any point in time and she did she really
15:18 likes traveling and she's a very
15:20 strong-minded person which is great but
15:25 she had just moved out of a home that
15:27 was essentially almost I would say about
15:30 35,000 square feet in a very very posh
15:33 amazing place down here in Southern
15:35 California you know the house was valued
15:39 at nearly 30 million dollars it did not
15:42 sell for that because they just want to
15:44 get rid of it because they were getting
15:45 to worst garage downstairs had 24 24 car
15:50 garage I believe with every single
15:52 exotic car you could possibly imagine
15:54 down there and I mean everything it look
16:00 like a little mall I've seen photographs
16:01 of this place the house above was just
16:05 unbelievable she got chance to design
16:07 most of it turned out great so then I
16:12 started asking I said you know what was
16:13 it like to live in this place she said I
16:16 instantly hated it second we moved in I
16:18 couldn't believe I got a chance to
16:20 design it exactly the way I wanted to
16:22 based on a general floor plan and she
16:25 said it I never saw my husband she goes
16:28 it was so large I rarely ever went to
16:31 certain at you know areas of the house I
16:33 felt alone constantly it took to so many
16:36 servants to keep the place dust free
16:40 that she could never be alone in her own
16:43 home I mean she couldn't like just walk
16:45 out of the bathroom without a towel on
16:47 and go to her bedroom dryer you know and
16:49 dress slowly she always had to be
16:50 covered up she had to close the door it
16:52 was like being in a hotel on the place
16:55 she bought I don't know I don't know
16:56 maybe it's a 2500 square feet and she
16:59 felt cozy and it was great and you might
17:03 think well she had a Lamborghini okay
17:08 you're not supposed to put that many
17:10 miles on a Lamborghini unless you're
17:12 literally you know like a billionaire
17:13 who can just use these things up like
17:15 you know big shavers right you're
17:19 supposed to put no less you know on
17:21 average you're not supposed to put more
17:23 than about 2,500 miles on a Lamborghini
17:25 per year because they're very expensive
17:27 to fix even though the reliability I
17:29 guess in the last ten years has been
17:31 greatly enhanced one of the guys I
17:35 smoked with he's a 28 year old prodigy
17:38 who fixes exotic cars his whole family's
17:41 been fixing exotic cars for decades and
17:43 will we will sit and watch you know
17:46 exotic car videos and stuff reviews and
17:48 he just sits there and cringes and I'm
17:52 like well what's up with that car he's
17:54 like oh my god that car barely could
17:56 stay running and if coincidentally he
17:59 said most of the Lamborghinis from 2005
18:01 and back especially like the famous
18:03 Countach is and what have you because
18:05 keeping these cars running at all
18:07 throughout the years is next to
18:09 impossible you need to be shovelling you
18:11 know five to ten thousand dollars into
18:14 the cars like every year just to keep
18:16 the engine starting I mean it's just
18:18 really bad right but the interesting
18:20 thing about this friend of mine that I
18:24 was able to date for a little while she
18:28 she really kind of an indirect way said
18:31 you know at no point with all this stuff
18:33 was I you know absolutely thrilled she
18:34 loved traveling she loved seeing the
18:36 world that was probably the best part of
18:37 what she was able to do and they
18:40 traveled in in a really big way we don't
18:43 we're talking about probably a hundred
18:45 foot yacht for like three people that
18:47 sort of thing and it was a huge
18:49 eye-opener for me because I had grown up
18:51 as a kid in a world where as much as we
18:57 could as Midwesterners and it's like
19:00 normal human beings trying to sort of
19:04 have the finest things that we loved you
19:07 know so in the in the in the 80s one of
19:09 the biggest things was home theaters it
19:11 was your physical stereo to portray the
19:14 sound and then it was your TV and then
19:15 it was your VCR and it was you know beta
19:18 then super beta and VHS and super VHS or
19:21 whatever of course there was the laser
19:23 discs and the DVDs and that kind of
19:25 thing then the blu-rays etc I had moved
19:28 out long before DVDs came out but that
19:31 was the focus and then I moved to
19:34 California and I met
19:38 I'll just say some of my mentors who
19:42 were extremely wealthy people I went to
19:44 their house and you know I worked with
19:46 some of these folks for like 20 years
19:48 and I go to their house and they have
19:51 very nice things don't get me wrong very
19:54 nice things the only differences they'll
19:57 have like a Barcelona chair you know
19:59 made in you know the 40s and they still
20:05 have it and it's immaculate they take
20:08 good care of it
20:09 they have beautiful items in their house
20:12 that look wonderful but they bought them
20:14 very slowly over 30 to 40 years and they
20:18 treat them beautifully and I would go
20:20 into their laboratory where they create
20:22 imagery for film and the computers were
20:26 very nice but not always brand new and
20:29 you would think that if you're if your
20:32 game is to use art supplies or what have
20:35 you that you might always get the best
20:38 of the best and there was definitely
20:39 some areas where the best of the best
20:41 was purchased on a daily basis but you
20:43 would be much more subtle than you might
20:45 think and I'm gonna share with you one
20:49 thing that my my friend Syd Mead has
20:51 talked about several times in public
20:53 because he's a good man to to use when
20:58 you think about consumerism his partner
21:01 Roger is the same same way essentially
21:05 what they say is look what is the task
21:07 that's a hand here what we trying to do
21:09 and this is gonna be a business thing
21:10 but you can think about this as your
21:11 home thing as well because they they
21:14 carry the philosophy into their homes as
21:16 well the thing he's warned people about
21:19 is the tech trap and the check trap is
21:22 where a lot of men run off and spend a
21:25 tremendous amount of money trying to get
21:27 the best of the best of the best
21:28 thinking that somehow buying the most
21:31 fancy guitar the most fancy you know
21:34 wood woodworking tools and stuff and
21:37 tools you know just your average toolbox
21:41 is gonna make you a great mechanic it's
21:43 gonna make you understand things a lot
21:44 better and indeed you do need something
21:47 but I will tell you that the the sort of
21:52 amazing erotic thing is if you can buy a
21:54 really cheap tool and get it done yeah
21:58 it might break but hey at that point you
22:01 haven't spent that much money go get
22:03 another one
22:04 but maybe you never have to do that task
22:05 again but Sid is a painter he does
22:08 gouache painting which is a very
22:11 elaborate form of watercolors that is
22:15 not like watercolors when you and I work
22:16 it it's actually photo real paintings
22:18 and where he spends his money is on the
22:22 quality of the paint it was a very
22:24 specific brand he buys and there's a
22:26 very specific brand of brushes that he
22:27 buys and he spends a tremendous amount
22:29 of money on his fine brush brushes I
22:34 should say and they're made of you know
22:37 the tail hair of llamas and yaks and
22:41 stuff it's just so fine it's organic and
22:44 so it doesn't split badly he's got
22:46 brushes with a couple couple follicles
22:49 out of the end because he paints things
22:51 so teeny-tiny that when you zoom them up
22:53 two or three hundred times it would
22:56 still be difficult for the average
22:57 painter to paint it with any brush the
23:00 computers that he uses cuz he's also an
23:02 amazing Photoshop guy is just whatever
23:06 needs to be there his version of
23:08 Photoshop is the version of Photoshop
23:10 that does what he needs it to do and
23:12 regardless of Adobe updates a million
23:14 times he's like look I just need to fill
23:17 these shapes with colors I need to be
23:18 able to do some blurring some layering
23:20 and I'm done and honestly if any of
23:24 you've ever played in Photoshop you'll
23:25 know that despite the years and decades
23:28 of promised updates and and
23:30 what-have-you nothing's really changed I
23:33 mean I've used that tool for 20 years as
23:35 an expert and I'm telling you I use the
23:38 same tools that I've been using for
23:40 years right and you know when I inherit
23:44 files from young students they're still
23:46 using the same stuff there's no like oh
23:48 my god is I'm totally incompatible with
23:49 the way people are drawing in Photoshop
23:51 nope it's all the same stuff so he saves
23:55 a tremendous amount of money and he also
24:00 saves a tremendous amount of focus he
24:03 stays focused on what
24:05 he needs to focus on to get his job done
24:08 and just before I closed off the
24:11 professional side of this whole thing a
24:12 lot of times you'll buy the latest and
24:15 greatest things and they're absolutely
24:17 complicated and so you lose your art
24:20 into the manuals and the how the hell do
24:23 you do this suite of things I used to
24:28 write music a lot in the 90s and use did
24:30 a lot of contract work for video games
24:32 and for personal projects of people
24:34 weddings and stuff just some ambient
24:36 music for commercials all kinds of stuff
24:39 and I used use this protocol master
24:41 tracks Pro on the Macintosh it was very
24:45 simple black and white and you know it
24:46 was before the color interfaces and you
24:48 just load it up you'd MIDI everything it
24:50 saved everything it had all the
24:52 quantifying algorithms to kind of fix
24:54 problems and cut and paste in your songs
24:56 very similar to today and then they
25:00 stopped making that product and so I
25:03 would often got Pro Tools and
25:06 immediately things got really
25:08 complicated then of course sound
25:10 engineers you go to college they are
25:11 taught right into that product and so
25:13 they understand all the ins and outs
25:15 that make this thing happen
25:17 of course now we you know write music
25:20 with all the instruments in our
25:21 computers which is fantastic so it's
25:23 been resupplied but there was an
25:25 interesting thing that happened because
25:26 i upgraded i spent a tremendous amount
25:29 of money probably 50 grand upgrading my
25:32 instruments my mixing boards my software
25:34 carvings inside my computers my computer
25:37 itself all this kind of stuff and i got
25:38 absolutely inundated with what sid me
25:41 talks about which is the tech trap he
25:45 was 100 percent correct so and I heard
25:46 him say tech trap about 10 years later I
25:49 was like oh my god that's me and there
25:53 was an interesting interview with Prince
25:55 the musician somewhere in the 90s
25:58 and he was going through a very tough
26:01 transition where most of his work in the
26:05 70s and early 80s was all with the
26:07 multitrack recording we had to play it
26:09 all live and this is where he would
26:10 layer himself over and over and over his
26:12 voice his instruments all that good
26:13 stuff but by the time he hit 1999 album
26:17 and probably even controversy and then
26:19 all the way up to probably the early 90s
26:23 he was relying on software and I don't
26:26 know what software he used but he had
26:27 mastered it he mastered his beat
26:29 machines and sequencers and all that
26:30 stuff he was just cranking out music
26:33 left and right some of the best stuff
26:34 he's ever made right and then he
26:37 transitioned about the diamonds and
26:39 pearls album into playing everything
26:42 live again and I believe the interview
26:45 that I heard was essentially saying that
26:47 he said look I got so inundated with
26:49 trying to understand my software that I
26:55 said screw this I'm just gonna grab a
26:57 regular sound engineer with a mixing
26:59 board I'm gonna make them do all the
27:01 hard work I'm gonna play everything live
27:02 again like I did in the 70s and he
27:06 actually said something to the effect of
27:08 I really became a musician for the very
27:10 first time in the 90s where he really
27:12 felt like he was playing jazz like he
27:15 was really up to it sort of a
27:17 sophisticated level of music he kind of
27:20 looked back on his past even though
27:21 obviously he created amazing music in
27:23 the past like legendary songs he felt
27:27 like that was consuming a tremendous
27:29 amount of his time using the hardware
27:32 and the software to make what was like
27:34 Purple Rain look let's go crazy amazing
27:36 song right super layered super amazing
27:39 he plays most of all the instruments
27:40 about all of them but he started
27:43 surrendering that control to get back to
27:45 his roots to get back to his heart the
27:47 simplification out of consumerism for
27:49 him as a solution to his business gave
27:53 him the gift that he was always looking
27:55 for which is to play more like probably
27:57 his father who was a master pianist and
27:59 jazz player so I thought that was pretty
28:02 cool but I know for a fact whatever
28:05 software he was using in the 90s didn't
28:07 exist ten years later I mean the name of
28:09 the product existed but he would had to
28:12 he would have had to you know get the
28:14 next version and learn all the features
28:15 in the next version right well let's
28:18 come back to the home and let's just
28:20 take the algorithm while buying
28:21 something because of those of you who've
28:24 ever watched the show hoarders you've
28:26 seen this algorithm several times which
28:29 is this sort of you wake up board is
28:35 usually how it works which means you
28:37 might have a nine-to-five job and you
28:38 haven't really considered having a hobby
28:41 besides watching sports or you know
28:44 maybe interacting with your friends
28:46 which is great but your friends aren't
28:48 always available sports aren't always on
28:50 and even if they are on it's a it's sort
28:53 of a a single gender game right it's you
28:57 know a lot of wife's want to sit down
28:59 with their husband and watch you know
29:01 six hours worth of sports some of you do
29:03 some of you don't my travels it's been
29:06 very few females wanted to dedicate any
29:08 amount of time to that it'll be like a
29:09 championship game or some important
29:11 local rivalry game that you want to
29:14 watch but after that you know let's go
29:16 live life so like George Carlin said you
29:20 know America turned into a mall nation
29:23 everyone go went to the mall to be
29:26 entertained to look in the windows and
29:28 things you can't afford from jewelry to
29:32 like a Bang and Olufsen stereo system
29:34 that's going to run you know eighty
29:35 thousand dollars for your house for just
29:37 your front room and then you come away
29:40 with something that you can purchase
29:42 which is sort of in a lot of cases for
29:45 at least a man and I think it happens
29:49 for females as well addicted to Louis
29:51 Vuitton or something like this it's I am
29:54 successful enough to have these things
29:55 and it's a measurement of yourself
29:57 you've externalized your inner value to
30:00 an outer value system obviously very
30:04 quickly you either burn through your
30:06 savings and you lose imagine you buy one
30:09 believe that on bag that's a trip for
30:12 two to Hawaii for a week easily easily
30:17 the tickets the hotel stay you know
30:20 thirty five hundred to five thousand
30:22 bucks easy
30:23 boom so you have this leather
30:26 now Pena they go up in value you can
30:29 hold them forever so long as you don't
30:30 break them you can usually sell them off
30:32 and get your money back at a minimum
30:34 usually a lot more it could be a huge
30:37 sacrifice but what about places that you
30:41 don't like targets Fry's Electronics for
30:44 those of you who haven't been to America
30:46 we have this chain of electronic stores
30:48 called Fry's and boy do they have a
30:50 thousand things consequently one of the
30:54 most entertaining things I ever did in
30:55 England was walking to the the stores
30:58 the the sort of how the name escapes me
31:03 I'm sorry it's like they're their target
31:06 and walk around and look at all the
31:08 different products that was really
31:09 entertaining just as the mystery of what
31:11 things are called and what kind of
31:13 brands exist over there that don't exist
31:16 here you know it's trippy I got the
31:18 squirrel sitting about ten feet behind
31:20 me just in the middle of my yard just
31:22 playing around the leaves really funny
31:24 but what's the algorithm right you go in
31:26 and you see something that looks fun you
31:28 can mess around with and you buy it and
31:33 you're so excited at the concept of
31:36 having this as a possession and you get
31:39 home and what I find is that most people
31:43 rarely use the item very quickly that's
31:46 interesting let's say you go and buy a
31:50 really big purchase you buy a Les Paul
31:52 guitar from Guitar Center here in
31:54 California well you bring it home you
31:58 maybe you have an amp all set up some
32:00 software whatever plug it in and you
32:03 play a play play play play and then you
32:07 got to go eat dinner and you know you
32:08 got to get back into life a little bit
32:10 you got to go to bed you got to go to
32:11 work or school or whatever and you put
32:14 it back in the case and you just look at
32:15 you're like oh my god it's so beautiful
32:17 I got a Les Paul unreal and the next day
32:21 you try to get it out again and you play
32:23 a little bit more but unless you're in a
32:24 band unless you're writing music unless
32:27 you're trying to upgrade what you're
32:28 doing it's just this thing and
32:32 invariably the deathblow to you ever
32:35 learning how to play the guitar or
32:36 becoming a regular player
32:40 if you buy the little uh little white
32:42 mounts for your wall because you want
32:46 all your friends to know that you've got
32:47 a Les Paul and you want to be perceived
32:48 as this musician and so you hang it on
32:51 the wall and the second you hang
32:53 something on the wall is the last time
32:55 you'll ever play it it's unbelievable
32:57 all kinds these folks in LA and you go
33:02 you go in their house and you look at
33:03 the whatever it is the Cousteau guitar
33:05 the bass guitar whatever is on the wall
33:07 and you go so you play that oh well you
33:10 know I used to and you find out that
33:13 they played it for maybe five hours out
33:16 of the two years they owned it and when
33:18 they hung it on the wall it was
33:19 essentially the death blow now it's
33:23 funny about this whole thing is that you
33:26 will have watched perhaps a hoarding
33:28 show and again for those of you who have
33:31 never seen a warning show or really
33:33 never really heard about this concept is
33:35 that individuals who they buy tons of
33:40 stuff they bring it home and they put it
33:44 down and they rarely ever look at that
33:48 item ever and their house is usually
33:50 full of tons of sealed bags from their
33:52 favorite stores like Target or Walmart
33:54 or whatever it's usually fairly
33:56 inexpensive things but they buy so many
33:59 of these things they never have any
34:00 money they'll have like eight-foot piles
34:05 in their homes stacked literally to the
34:08 ceiling when they have to create
34:10 corridors you know walk through their
34:11 own homes right so I watch friends who
34:16 watch the shows and they'll they'll
34:18 agonize over this horrible pattern this
34:20 person has and how you know filthy their
34:23 homes are in a lot of cases but on micro
34:26 level they're doing kind of the exact
34:27 same thing they buy things they don't
34:29 need and they'll a lot of times by their
34:33 memories from the past and we're all
34:35 guilty of this I bought old classic
34:36 computers and you mess with them for a
34:42 little while you realize that they're
34:43 really ancient and you wouldn't really
34:45 spend any time with them people buy old
34:47 art re 2600 home console games the whole
34:51 console in the games and they'll try to
34:52 find a little adapter so that
34:53 see it on their flat screen TV and
34:55 they'll play it and then you know ten
34:59 minutes into their like this is really
35:00 sucky this is really bad I have a
35:03 relative of mine who bought the he
35:07 bought of sort of a carnival vending
35:09 machine where you put the little coin in
35:13 which is usually says like six flags on
35:15 and or what have you you put it in there
35:16 and you can pound out letters on the
35:18 outer rim of your name the date so that
35:21 you can take home kind of a relic from
35:23 the park but this person bought the
35:24 whole machine and then bought a bunch of
35:27 blank coins put it in the living room
35:30 now it's kind of a neat little thing to
35:31 have in living room if you just know
35:33 it's just a piece of furniture a little
35:34 bit of decor to make that thing look
35:36 great
35:36 and I guess you could say I've been to
35:39 this person's house but pounding out a
35:40 coin you know it was kind of interesting
35:43 but it's probably one of the most
35:45 unequivocal useless things you could
35:47 ever buy for your house and it was
35:49 definitely an homage to this person's
35:51 past because they really appreciated
35:53 their youth and when these machines were
35:56 in parks they loved it the moderation
35:59 you could do those things you'd be
36:01 alright but the idea is if you buy
36:03 something you're gonna be happy and
36:06 invariably that's never the case you
36:09 know if you're buying that the staple
36:10 items a good sofa good bed maybe a great
36:13 TV a good computer cuz you use a
36:16 computer a lot that's a little bit
36:19 different those are utilities for your
36:21 very existence in your own home I have
36:25 in the last year upgraded my vehicle and
36:28 I was fortunate enough to upgrade to a
36:30 very nice vehicle the previous vehicle I
36:34 had owned for gosh let's see nine years
36:39 and it started having a lot of engine
36:41 problems and it was leaking oil and it
36:43 was just it was on its last leg so I
36:45 needed to get a new car and I bought a
36:48 car that was probably four times as much
36:50 as my other car in the short term that
36:53 I've owned this brand new car that's I
36:56 think is phenomenal gorgeous and all
36:58 this other stuff I realized well if I'd
37:03 had my head out of my ass I probably
37:04 would have bought a car maybe
37:06 50% more than my other car I've had
37:12 someone scratched the hood
37:15 I've had someone rear-end me and then my
37:19 rear exhaust pipe another drunk guy run
37:24 into my rear left wheel I've had a giant
37:28 bolt or something pound my windshield
37:30 and put a three-inch star on my
37:33 windshield huge the worst impact I've
37:36 seen on anyone's car save an actual
37:37 accident and I'm sitting there going
37:40 geez I've owned you know I've always had
37:43 brand new cars since I was 18 years old
37:45 I started having the financial control
37:47 over my own life I had one car for five
37:50 years I had one car I still owned it's
37:52 25 years old and sexy 24 years old this
38:00 month and I've had one other car that
38:03 home for nine years and I got rid of it
38:04 and replaced it with this one I've never
38:06 had so many problems trying to keep my
38:08 car
38:09 decent this thing is a magnet for people
38:14 to [ __ ] run into right the car makes
38:20 me happy on one level I like getting
38:22 into a fine vehicle but now I know to
38:25 repair all this stuff that's gonna cost
38:27 me you know a good coin license plates
38:30 registration went way up still under
38:33 warranty it's running really well of
38:34 course it's only a year old but when it
38:37 does hit at 60,000 mile mark or it's
38:42 like it's a 10-year bumper to bumper
38:45 it's gonna cost a lot of money to keep
38:47 this thing going a lot of money the
38:51 tires alone are expensive the brakes are
38:54 going to be expensive and so I didn't
38:57 really think it through I had a very
38:59 fortunate financial situation last year
39:02 and I committed myself to this vehicle
39:06 as a mechanism to keep myself riveted to
39:09 my career and keep pushing forward so I
39:12 used it sort of as a psychological
39:13 pressure mechanism to say you got to
39:16 make this amount of money
39:17 this is your new responsibility and
39:19 you're gonna have two or three years
39:20 maybe even four years of great coverage
39:23 on your car so you're not gonna be
39:24 incurring that the lion's share of the
39:27 of expenses but now I can already tell
39:31 it's gonna take a lot to get this thing
39:32 back to the way it was when I drove it
39:34 off a lot because of all the morons
39:35 hitting my cars hitting my car but
39:39 here's the cycle I want you guys to to
39:41 know about and for those of you you're
39:43 probably over 40 and you've been through
39:45 this process if you've done this before
39:46 40 I'm gonna tell you you're you're
39:48 ahead of the game if you've never run
39:50 into this which I'm gonna mention a
39:52 group in LA that hasn't run into this
39:54 you have already programmed yourself to
39:57 win your whole life if you were in your
40:00 20s in the night in the 90s or older you
40:04 probably were swept away with some of
40:05 this consumerism because the malls were
40:07 just being built by the dozens and you
40:09 we had products on on the market that
40:11 we'd never seen before choices you know
40:13 it was like when I was a kid and you
40:15 wanted to buy a candy bar you went to
40:17 the store and man there was maybe like a
40:18 dozen maybe and now there's like five
40:21 dozen choices I so part of it is just
40:25 five let's try this one out let's try
40:27 that one out and it's every every genre
40:29 of everything computers telephones
40:32 everything right but sooner than later
40:35 you will come out of that coma and
40:38 understand that this stuff is never
40:40 really making you happy like you want to
40:42 be happy and so you start to realize
40:44 that the things that make you happy are
40:46 sort of damn near the free stuff
40:48 companionship you know you know a good
40:52 meal is a good meal
40:53 sometimes good meals it cost a lot of
40:55 money sometimes they don't it's one of
40:57 those things when you get to the end of
40:58 the month you don't any money left and
40:59 you're like damn we're all going you
41:01 look at your sushi billing you're like
41:02 Jesus okay I know I haven't figured it
41:04 out now one of the things that Americans
41:07 don't do as much as we used to is travel
41:09 and the main reason behind this in my
41:12 opinion is because we're we're dying of
41:14 microtransactions
41:15 buy something for a buck buy something
41:17 for five bucks you know this little apps
41:19 on your telephone right you know people
41:22 play games like clash of clans on their
41:24 telephones and they will literally pay
41:27 $10 to finish like the construction of a
41:29 little virtual building
41:31 in a game that is geared to destroy you
41:33 no matter how much money you spend you
41:35 could be a prince of Dubai and put a
41:37 million dollars into clash of clans and
41:39 you will get your entire village wiped
41:41 out by the next kid because that's how
41:44 they roll
41:44 they always punish you down so you have
41:46 to spend more money that's how the game
41:47 works right so in America we we start
41:51 becoming not necessarily xenophobic
41:54 which means you know afraid of people
41:56 outside of our planet we just don't have
41:57 the intimate knowledge because we can't
41:59 get there we can't afford it
42:01 and so we travel within the borders of
42:04 our own country if we travel at all
42:06 we'll go down the street you know when
42:08 you live in Southern California it is
42:09 tough to find places that will eclipse
42:12 you know the general quality of life the
42:15 weather is fantastic here we have a lot
42:16 of scenery and if you want to go to the
42:19 most beautiful beaches just drive three
42:21 miles that way you know but you can't go
42:24 off to Hawaii and various exotic islands
42:27 in the Bahamas and and get better better
42:30 views but that costs a tremendous amount
42:32 of money because it cost you two things
42:34 right it cost you to get to the vacation
42:35 but also you have to pay for everything
42:37 back here depending on how far you go
42:40 you gotta pay rent even though you're
42:42 not here you're you know some of you are
42:44 self-employed you simply will not earn
42:46 any money when you're not working so it
42:49 becomes an issue right but there's a
42:51 simplification phase that starts to
42:54 happen in your 40s where you start to go
42:55 look I don't need all this crap in fact
42:58 I don't want to have a house with all
43:00 this crap in it because you start
43:03 thinking well what man if what if I had
43:04 to move you know what if the economy
43:06 crashed or if you're a renter you know
43:09 your landlord doesn't want to rent the
43:10 house anymore and you had to pick up all
43:12 your stuff and leave well if you have a
43:15 simplified life that move might be a few
43:18 u-haul trucks or maybe even one u-haul
43:21 truck from point A to point B and you're
43:22 good if you own a whole house full of
43:24 stuff now you're renting a semi and
43:26 you're hiring a big moving company it
43:27 could be three or four thousand dollars
43:29 just to move down the street because you
43:31 have so much stuff you don't want to get
43:33 all messed up so you don't hire just
43:34 these starving students you need to have
43:37 really bonded workers that if they drop
43:39 your priceless thingy majiggy you have
43:42 to you have some liability to get it
43:44 replaced or
43:44 least financially get compensated right
43:46 my old show impaled to radio my co-host
43:50 and I Kyle we've talked about this at
43:53 length of the simplification of life
43:56 here's the beauty of simplification the
44:00 one thing that you get well you get two
44:02 you get two actually wonderful things
44:04 believe it or not the most important
44:06 thing is control you get control over
44:09 your life you get control over your
44:11 money and you start to understand that
44:13 you no longer get manipulated by
44:16 marketing like you used to in fact you
44:19 know for those of you who've pulled out
44:20 of television you know that you have d
44:23 consumer eyes yourself because you're no
44:25 longer being fed this algorithm of boy
44:29 if you don't have this you're not as
44:31 good as your neighbor you're not going
44:32 to be as happy as you possibly could be
44:34 before you die but the other thing that
44:38 comes with control is happiness you will
44:43 become extremely happy to be alive and
44:46 that's important right isn't that what
44:48 we're all trying to do find a perfect
44:50 balance you wake up in the morning you
44:51 have everything that you need you have
44:53 quality items for the things that are
44:54 imperative your strategic resources you
44:57 have more money to buy better food
44:58 non-gmo food non-fluoridated toothpaste
45:02 you can afford a water filter on your
45:04 whole house not just the front you know
45:06 faucet and you start to gain more health
45:11 more peace of mind and you start to you
45:15 start to undo this sort of subconscious
45:17 feeling that you're a sucker that you
45:19 can't control yourself someone else
45:22 controls you and it is a beautiful thing
45:25 but if you start experiencing this in
45:27 your 40s you'll definitely be happy but
45:30 one of us one of the interesting side
45:32 effects is that you start to regret ever
45:34 being in this game you start to
45:38 reimagine your 20s if you hadn't bought
45:41 into all this consumerism and your 30s
45:44 or what have you have you ever had a an
45:47 addiction to something that you spent
45:50 money on routinely routinely routinely
45:52 routinely for guys to smoke a lot of
45:54 Cuban cigars I guarantee there's a
45:57 moment in their life where they
45:58 they find themselves perhaps in a
46:00 financial tough spot and in their brain
46:03 they think wow what if I had all the
46:05 money back that I spent on Cuban cigars
46:09 and they start to realize cheese I would
46:11 probably have ten grand in the bank it
46:13 could be you're addicted to fancy
46:15 coffees and you start to look at you
46:18 know your bills you can't pain you
46:19 thinking jeez what if I had all the
46:21 money back for the cappuccinos and the
46:23 lattes and the espressos and you start
46:26 to think geez I would have six grand in
46:28 the bank just for this year pretty of
46:31 you use budgeting software like
46:33 QuickBooks or something like that there
46:35 quicken and they could tell you if once
46:37 you categorize all your expenses how
46:39 much you've blown when you're young
46:41 sometimes you don't understand that this
46:43 is what's happening to you
46:44 which is why I want to mention it now
46:48 I'm not saying that you shouldn't buy
46:49 nice things what I'm probably saying is
46:51 buy very nice things but by limited
46:54 amounts of them make them your strategic
46:56 resources the things that make you
46:58 really happy like a great bed is a good
47:01 one because you get a good night's sleep
47:02 perhaps you want to spend it on clothing
47:05 that's really high-quality clothing that
47:07 you don't have to replace every single
47:08 year because it rots away when you know
47:11 tied it disintegrates your clothing I've
47:15 been informed that tide is the most
47:18 volatile soap you can use on your
47:20 clothing
47:20 I have some friends that work in
47:24 high-end clothing stores and they they
47:27 say whatever you do never use Tide it
47:30 eats up the fabric it eats up the
47:31 threading that hold your clothes
47:32 together and you will have to replace
47:35 your clothing all the time now there's a
47:39 new generation that's coming about that
47:41 is I guess you could call it the Jen's
47:44 ears and in Los Angeles there's kind of
47:47 this movement I'm not sure how potent it
47:50 is today but I would say ten years ago I
47:53 weave up into these kids in their early
47:55 20s to mid 20s and they were wearing
47:58 clothing that was made a long time ago
48:00 they got it
48:02 not necessarily thrift stores in fact
48:03 someone might pay a lot of money to get
48:05 some of these clothing some of this
48:06 clothing but they refused to wear
48:08 expensive watches they refused to be
48:12 dead with anything that cost a lot of
48:15 money it was sort of this
48:16 anti-consumerism movement but I think a
48:18 lot of these folks are gonna take into
48:20 their 30s and they're able to travel
48:23 they're able to have nice things if they
48:25 want to buy a nice car
48:26 they conservatively look around to see
48:29 which cars are most reliable as well as
48:31 inexpensive or if they are expensive you
48:33 know what does the maintenance look like
48:36 are the previous owners of this
48:37 particular model happy with it isn't
48:39 have good consumer reviews and so we're
48:42 seeing kind of a turn that I haven't
48:45 seen in my lifetime in the Midwest
48:47 something really interesting happened in
48:49 the 70s which I was actually capable of
48:51 seeing because I had grandparents that
48:54 had one code of ethics and went up
48:56 bringing and again my grandparents were
48:58 10 years apart from each other meaning
49:01 on one side of my family my father's
49:04 family his parents were 10 years older
49:06 than my mother's family and so my
49:09 father's mother and grandfather grew up
49:13 through the Depression and boy did that
49:16 forever scar them in a way that said
49:20 only buy quality items only buy the
49:22 items if you need them and absolutely
49:25 positively use them up before you
49:27 replace them make sure they can no
49:30 longer function before you rationalize
49:32 getting a new one you don't need a new
49:33 one just because you want a new one you
49:35 need a new one because the old one
49:36 doesn't work anymore and then even my
49:39 grandparents that grew up see one of my
49:41 grandparents were born in the teens 1910
49:44 and 1912 my other grandparents were born
49:46 and I believe 1920 and 1923
49:51 both sets of them never got caught up in
49:55 this consumerism and I think it may it
49:57 may have been do part to the depression
50:00 but it also had to do with simply not
50:03 being inundated much by marketing and
50:06 one of my grandparents sets of
50:09 grandparents I should say had quite a
50:11 bit of money that was that was earned
50:13 through decades of previous generations
50:16 saving money and they had a lot of land
50:17 and they still do to this day even
50:19 though they're passed away but you went
50:21 to their house and they had just an
50:24 average television
50:25 average furniture and had to raise five
50:28 kids as well but he when the kids were
50:30 gone and they were just bathing in their
50:31 own annuities the house was normal all
50:36 the way to their death in their 70s and
50:39 then I watched my parents which were
50:42 kind of split down the middle one of my
50:45 parents is very conservative and again
50:47 doesn't buy anything unless it's
50:48 necessary and one of my parents was
50:50 really into buying the latest and
50:52 greatest things and eventually a drove
50:54 that drove them apart because there was
50:57 an incompatibility of consumerism and
50:58 the debt that comes with such a thing
51:01 and so it was all a very valuable lesson
51:03 for both sides of the fence and both of
51:05 them well obviously one of them just
51:07 continued their conservative regimen
51:10 while the other side learned their
51:14 lesson and calm down a little bit you
51:18 know and so I was able to see the the
51:22 sort of baby boomer generation walk
51:25 right into all the consumerism and get
51:27 eaten alive by it as well as all the
51:28 other baby boomer parents that were the
51:31 parents of my friends right and so what
51:34 I was able to see was that happiness was
51:36 in the more conservative realm of
51:38 thinking and spending and the one that
51:42 went often spent a tremendous amount of
51:44 money was in constant strife and carried
51:47 a bankruptcy it was embarrassing and
51:51 when you have to reset from scratch it's
51:54 it's an ass-kicker because you kind of
51:58 have that scar on your finances you
51:59 can't just go buy what you want the bank
52:01 rejects loans if you're applying to live
52:04 somewhere or work somewhere sometimes
52:06 they would care whether or not you've
52:07 ever bankrupt to see what kind of person
52:08 you are which is now a very horrific
52:13 thing today they always check and
52:15 there's certain government jobs you
52:16 can't have because they just look at you
52:18 and say well your person that doesn't
52:19 believe you should pay your debt to
52:21 society when you borrow money from banks
52:23 right again we have no love for banks on
52:25 this show but it's not you know as
52:29 corrupt as banks are it's still our
52:31 responsibility to
52:33 to spend our money wisely and not drive
52:36 up interest rates because we're
52:38 constantly making the banks eat our our
52:41 bad habits right through bankruptcies
52:43 right consequently you need to know in
52:45 America that the bankruptcy laws have
52:51 been rewritten in this country such that
52:53 it you really don't have the ability to
52:55 bankrupt like you used to so for those
52:58 who have been bank you know using the
53:00 bankruptcy mechanism to constantly
53:02 refresh every ten years or whatever
53:03 interval they can they can't run away
53:06 from it anymore like they used to
53:09 now if you want it through a business I
53:11 guess it's still pretty good you can
53:12 totally bankrupt and walk away from
53:14 everything but you'd have to create an
53:16 LLC of some sort to protect yourself and
53:18 then you'd have to somehow convince the
53:20 state of the country that you're able to
53:22 purchase everything that you need
53:24 through your company a lot of times
53:26 you'll pierce your own company veil your
53:28 corporate veil by buying products for
53:31 yourself that have no business being in
53:32 your business and then you can get in a
53:34 lot of trouble that way so you can no
53:36 longer to run away like you used to and
53:39 some people might view that as bat and
53:42 some people might view that as good Ross
53:44 Perot said something very interesting
53:45 when he was running for president in the
53:48 early 90s here in America he said you
53:50 know this guy's a billionaire three
53:53 times over and he said you know saving
53:57 up for what you want to buy is probably
54:00 more fun than actually buying the
54:02 product that you actually end up with
54:04 and when he first said that I was like
54:06 how can that even be possible and now
54:08 that I've done it several times he's
54:10 completely right you know I've owned the
54:15 c-124 cars I've owned four cars in my
54:18 lifetime three of them I've gone through
54:20 loans to buy the cars and one of them I
54:24 just paid cash and there was nothing
54:27 better than to be in an economic crash
54:29 of 2008 subprime loan [ __ ] and I
54:33 owned my car and so I could I could do
54:36 full coverage insurance I could do
54:38 liability insurance I'd never had a car
54:40 payment which was nice consequently I
54:43 got really bad treatment at the
54:44 dealership because I wasn't gonna
54:46 eat their loan gene Simmons of kiss
54:50 obviously he's done very well for
54:52 himself at a very early age with the
54:54 band Kiss and so he's had a lot of money
54:56 but at the same time he said look I only
54:59 buy what I can afford with cash and you
55:01 should do the same now again if you want
55:04 to buy a home or again a car sometimes
55:06 you don't have that kind of money
55:07 sitting around but if you can keep
55:10 everything else in your life that are
55:12 not these giant giant items which
55:13 usually cost an arm and a leg if you can
55:16 buy everything else your sofa your TV
55:18 with cash your computer whatever you
55:21 have no debt and let me tell you when
55:24 you go through a financial crisis you'll
55:26 thank your lucky stars that that's what
55:27 you did
55:28 consumerism is also important because
55:31 how many people really talk to you about
55:33 this subject you know it's a subject
55:35 every time you buy something you think
55:37 about the the wisdom of buying something
55:40 you know little tiny items no and that's
55:42 where we can in America today we're
55:45 sitting on Amazon and we're just buying
55:48 a bunch of crap we don't need malls are
55:52 starting to die in America thank God and
55:55 I don't want I don't want necessarily uh
55:59 home owned businesses to go out of
56:01 business but I wouldn't mind if a couple
56:02 corporations folded I wouldn't mind if a
56:04 few fast-food chains folded but they're
56:08 so cheap right when I go to my hometown
56:10 which I've talked about several times
56:12 one of the biggest problems is is that
56:14 Walmart has destroyed all the local
56:17 businesses because they can sell paper
56:19 towels for cheaper or food for cheaper
56:20 that's obviously sometimes paper towels
56:23 are paper towels but a lot of times food
56:24 is not always just food the organic
56:27 beautiful stuff that you can buy from a
56:29 local merchant or a restaurant owner
56:32 that believes in healthy food it's going
56:34 to cost more than the ones that are
56:35 fast-food joints so what if you saved
56:38 your money and didn't buy a bunch of
56:40 crap you didn't need then you could
56:41 afford to buy products from your local
56:44 community and this goes for everywhere
56:45 in the entire world keeping the money in
56:49 your neighborhood because it goes to
56:50 your neighbor and then they spend it on
56:52 another neighbor and then it comes back
56:54 to you because they buy your services
56:55 and the same money goes in a nice little
56:57 circle
56:58 well if you go to a big giant
57:00 corporation the money goes overseas
57:02 typically away from your country away
57:05 from your neighborhood you have choices
57:07 I don't know about you but when you wake
57:10 up with when I wake up with any type of
57:14 loan over my head its pressure it's
57:18 stress now you may be able to you know
57:21 comfortably pay your bills and you're
57:23 fine
57:23 but again when someone says oh my god I
57:26 think the bond market is gonna fall out
57:27 in 2018 because of George Soros betting
57:30 against everything you know succeeding
57:32 and you look at that loan on your house
57:34 your car or computer or whatever the
57:37 hell you're borrowing money for it
57:39 becomes a whole different headline in
57:43 your mind oh my god am I gonna lose my
57:46 ability to charge for my work right I
57:49 want you guys to have control over your
57:51 life I want you guys to be happy I want
57:54 you guys to be financially secure and
57:57 I'll tell you this some of you are gonna
57:59 listen to this and you haven't gotten
58:00 yourself in over your head yet and good
58:05 for you
58:05 hang on to whatever the hell you're
58:07 doing that keeps you in that status but
58:10 if you find yourself listening to this
58:11 and you're oh my god that is exactly my
58:13 problem it's okay it's alright because
58:18 one of the things you could do very
58:19 easily in this world is stop doing what
58:21 you've been doing right and again like
58:25 Ross Perot said why don't you look at
58:26 your entire household and say okay what
58:29 am i addicted to buying that I don't
58:30 need to buy maybe I don't go to the mall
58:32 all the time to buy anything I just go
58:34 to look it's your first detox out of
58:37 spending your money on everything and
58:40 every time you walk out of the mall and
58:41 you don't buy anything and in fact I've
58:42 had situations where I've been destitute
58:44 at times and I would go to these malls
58:46 and I would just look and I'd walk out
58:49 but a fries I walk around and I walk out
58:52 and the amount of euphoric feeling I
58:55 would have that I didn't buy anything
58:56 was huge
58:57 I felt I succeeded I feel like I kicked
59:00 whatever little habit I might have had
59:02 right I used to be addicted to buying
59:04 books god I would go to the bookstore in
59:07 geez I just come away with two or three
59:09 books constantly
59:11 most the time I had the time to explore
59:13 the books and read them cover to cover
59:15 but there was a point where I bought so
59:16 many books that I started having books
59:18 that I barely read any pages in and so
59:21 when I started realizing Jesus I gotta
59:23 buy new bookshelves to hold these books
59:25 and I haven't even read you know the new
59:28 ones that I bought I haven't read even
59:30 half of them and that was more
59:32 devastating to my personality and my
59:34 character than anything else so I just
59:35 said look let's just stop until we get
59:37 through these books and then this makes
59:39 sure that we actually need to read this
59:40 stuff in the first place and once you
59:43 find out that a lot of books are full of
59:44 crap anyway you you don't want to buy
59:47 them anyway
59:48 it's all pop science crap right a bunch
59:51 of lies about how the world works or
59:53 something but there's always a new scam
59:56 out there isn't there there's always a
59:58 new game that it will either play to
60:01 you're sort of keeping up appearances
60:03 algorithm which is you showing off to
60:05 your neighbors or your friends there was
60:08 a new version of that and then there's
60:09 ones that actually pull at your
60:11 heartstrings and I'm gonna probably take
60:14 a fairly unpopular view on this
60:16 particular one but I think it's one I've
60:17 seen it's consumed my friends there are
60:21 good people out there that love animals
60:23 and usually the people who love animals
60:26 are some of the most wonderful people if
60:28 not the most wonderful people you can
60:30 ever meet if you're a guy and you want
60:32 to find a good woman if she's willing to
60:34 take care of an animal she's willing to
60:35 take care of your ass and and likewise
60:39 they also have patience for things that
60:42 don't go their way cuz animals are wild
60:43 animals right but what's the game today
60:48 the game today is to rescue animals and
60:51 there's always an infinite supply of
60:53 them isn't there it's always an infinite
60:57 supply there's always a stray animal
61:00 walking around in public people will
61:02 pick these animals up and bring them
61:03 home and it's not that the person's bad
61:09 for doing this the fact they're showing
61:11 their their most inner empathy for a
61:15 living being and so they're essentially
61:18 proving to society you know I'm a good
61:20 person
61:22 but the problem is is that it's a scam
61:25 and it's getting more and more intense
61:27 and people are trying to adopt more
61:28 animals and they could possibly take
61:30 care of they start losing their own life
61:32 because they can't leave the house
61:33 because they've got six animals at home
61:35 when it gets to be a bad economy they
61:37 can't really afford to keep everything
61:39 fed properly when stress is hitting you
61:42 maybe the animal reduces their stress
61:44 maybe the animal increases their stress
61:47 but in the end everyone suffers because
61:50 everything gets out of moderation it
61:52 gets overwhelming anyone has ever dealt
61:55 with a veterinarian you know that they
61:56 sort of make up prices on the spot you
61:59 know I had a friend of mine who had a
62:00 cat had an infected tooth and she took
62:03 the the cat to the veterinarian and they
62:05 said well the cat needs to have the
62:07 tooth pulled and they need a shot right
62:10 away to get rid of the pain and they
62:13 wanted to charge her 850 dollars for the
62:15 shot all right and they wanted another
62:19 like six or $700 to pull the tooth and I
62:23 watched her say because we dropped the
62:26 pet off and we went and ate lunch he
62:27 came back and then this big bill was
62:29 sitting right there in front of her and
62:31 she essentially said you know I'm not
62:33 gonna pay that that's ridiculous you
62:35 know I will find someone else who will
62:37 do this for a lot cheaper and
62:39 immediately they 50% of the bill
62:40 immediately because they know their
62:43 margin on that shots probably what 15 20
62:45 bucks that's what they had to pay for
62:47 the shot and pulling the tooth secretes
62:49 that you know you require the skillset
62:50 of a doctor to do this properly so yeah
62:53 maybe that maybe the doctor who's
62:55 working you know 15 minutes to get the
62:57 tooth out of the cat is consuming maybe
63:00 you know if you paid them $200 to pull
63:02 the tooth and you multiply that times
63:04 the minutes in an hour they're making
63:05 you know 800 bucks in an hour moving to
63:09 the next animal the next animal right so
63:12 we have to be careful about what we
63:14 rationalize as well because sometimes
63:16 it's geared right against your humanity
63:18 and they're going to say look if you
63:20 don't spend this money your pet is
63:22 hurting and your pet is your child you
63:26 know buddy mine had a dog that died of
63:28 cancer very quickly and it's just about
63:30 the time that Chinese food came over
63:32 with the cancer in the food and his dog
63:35 absolutely just went from completely
63:37 healthy running around Havasu to dead
63:40 before the dog died he spent I believe
63:44 no less than nine thousand dollars
63:47 trying to help the dog not have pain and
63:49 all this other kind of stuff and of
63:50 course we all love this dog when this
63:52 dog passed we had a vigil before he
63:54 passed and I'm telling you 80 people
63:57 from around Los Angeles drove to this
63:59 house to pet him for the last time and
64:01 that wasn't including the burial but if
64:05 you've buried a relative you know that
64:07 the the bills are insane for all the
64:11 services and they try to sell you every
64:12 little thing they'll try to sell you a
64:14 car that's going to be passed out to
64:16 people who see your relative and they
64:18 want you know the stationery bill on
64:20 line would have been 60 bucks but they
64:22 want to charge you 600 bucks because
64:25 they're screwing you with your humanity
64:26 and your feelings so some of the
64:29 consumerism that you have to get away
64:31 from it's going to be a defensive play
64:33 on your part you're gonna have to
64:34 anticipate who's gonna be fair and who's
64:37 not gonna be fair and sometimes these
64:39 are things out of your control if your
64:40 pet gets sick then you know it could be
64:44 because consumerism lies you fed them
64:46 food that was deemed okay because they
64:48 have a really old brand that's been
64:50 around for 60 years but now that brands
64:52 buying their meat from China which has
64:54 carcinogens and it's so bad that your
64:56 pet dies but if you've saved money in
64:59 other consumer areas you could afford to
65:01 feed your food feed your dog better food
65:03 this is vicious cycle so I'm interested
65:07 because I'm interested in your opinions
65:09 because I think we've all dealt with
65:11 this some of us are dealing with this
65:12 and I think you I think we all have to
65:14 deal with it constantly because we need
65:15 things to live and you know I'm lonely
65:20 about a lot of you have become very
65:21 creative with solving this problem the
65:24 transformations in your mind that you
65:25 went from point A to point B or some of
65:28 you skipped over completely and I have
65:30 to say regardless of a group you're in
65:33 your lessons will help all of us and so
65:38 please if you can get down in the
65:39 comment section and kind of
65:41 help us all understand how you did it
65:45 and if you're stuck in it really badly
65:47 and you need some help then just you
65:49 know anonymously just kind of say what's
65:51 what's driving you nuts
65:52 are you having a problem maybe some of
65:55 us can get in there and help but I think
65:58 you feel me deep thoughts radio.com for
66:02 all the feeds there's video on YouTube
66:04 and Vimeo I forgot to mention this but
66:06 on vid me the the nice thing about that
66:09 is if you guys are interested in this
66:10 show we have very few views on the first
66:13 season of the show because I used music
66:18 from my music collection to open the
66:20 show and close the show and YouTube has
66:23 a problem with digital rights in foreign
66:26 countries so a lot of the videos are
66:27 blocked in foreign countries on YouTube
66:29 so if you go to vid me you're able to
66:31 see season one and its pristine
66:33 condition I even fix the intros on the
66:35 first twelve episodes because I didn't a
66:38 music at first and I had the wrong title
66:41 on I think episode 7 which is a
66:45 screenwriting episode I think the credit
66:47 says it's 8 or something like that it's
66:48 messed up so I fix that as well for
66:50 those of you want to listen to this in
66:51 your car it's on iTunes or Google Play
66:54 or you can just go to deep thoughts
66:55 radio comm and click on the RSS feed and
66:57 it will load up on your telephone your
66:59 favorite podcast listener there's also a
67:02 patreon account which folks are
67:04 contributing to so I want to say thank
67:06 you to every single person who's on
67:07 patreon
67:08 sometimes you asked me for a paypal
67:10 because you don't want to lose the
67:12 attacks that patreon puts on you I'm
67:15 going to be putting that up at some
67:17 point so just keep your eyes open on
67:20 that and you'll see a probably a PayPal
67:22 link at the top and you know it does
67:26 help help me put the show on you know
67:28 how to switch out computers which is the
67:30 main thing don't worry about cigar costs
67:32 that's something I can take care of very
67:34 easily here but at some point maybe this
67:36 camera dies or something like that I
67:38 just would love to report that you guys
67:39 made the show continue I think that that
67:41 makes it more of our show instead of my
67:43 show you know so anyway take care of
67:46 yourself and someone else and I'll see
67:47 in the next deep thoughts over now
