00:00 [Music]
00:33 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen it's a lot of my babalu it's
00:40 like a cameroon connecticut maduro
00:42 rapper twist as you can see today we're
00:45 gonna talk about crap science and you
00:50 know if you watch all the shows you know
00:52 I talk about this kind of stuff off and
00:54 on but I thought what we do is put down
01:01 our own science on top of it meaning how
01:05 do you define crap science because I'm
01:08 setting up the gear today and I'm kind
01:09 of excited it's a really beautiful day
01:12 Studios all clean the other thing
01:16 unattractive is the hose here which I
01:18 can probably put away because the little
01:20 dog that lived next door moved away and
01:24 if he started barking during the show I
01:26 just sprayed the tree in my yard and
01:28 that freaked him out the sound frickin
01:30 mountain he'd go inside it's really cute
01:32 but crap science crap science is here so
01:36 I'm gonna define it we should probably
01:39 come up with some levels let's just make
01:42 it up here let's just say there's a
01:44 level three I don't think we need to go
01:47 any higher than that the level three
01:49 will be the most pure florrum of crap
01:52 science our measurement will be this no
01:56 matter how many years decades and
01:59 centuries that you apply yourself to a
02:01 particular level three craft science
02:05 you will never ever find anything
02:07 because you were so full of crap but all
02:10 you're doing is reiterating [ __ ] in
02:12 your brain you're so off base from how
02:16 the mechanics of the universe work it
02:19 just won't work and we'll let level two
02:23 arrive when it arrives but level one
02:25 would be well you're sort of getting
02:27 warm or you're sort of warm or you know
02:30 what you could you could eventually find
02:33 the right path
02:37 because it looks like you're not so
02:39 completely indoctrinated and confuse
02:41 that you're gonna stick in this craft
02:42 science level 3 level 3 crap science
02:46 would be someone who's also so embedded
02:49 so invested in [ __ ] science that their
02:55 ego and their self-image and perhaps
02:57 their alkaloids from the outside world
02:59 they're Awards for what they've done are
03:01 so tied up in it there's nothing they
03:05 can do to pull out of it they have
03:06 thrown down the law in their own brains
03:10 now the saddest part is is that people
03:14 who believe that sort of thing like a
03:16 Neil deGrasse Tyson I don't know what he
03:18 believes a science guy who [ __ ] cares
03:20 I got read summer's script 24/7
03:25 but let's say a Neil deGrasse Tyson he's
03:26 got a PhD he's dr. grass Tyson deGrasse
03:31 Tyson whatever I don't you know he seems
03:36 pretty confident in his in his spiel but
03:39 I mean the guy walks in the room then
03:40 people just [ __ ] coward down because
03:43 they have no knowledge in his area of
03:45 expertise
03:47 you know yeah thing to his backup on
03:49 that guy his career he's not a hulking
03:52 people he didn't he's not known for
03:55 revolutionising a zero-point energy
03:56 system and now he's just [ __ ] around
03:58 on Zoolander 2 I simply go on Joe Brogan
04:02 go on some show and say you know what
04:04 guys I think we've had it wrong and I
04:07 think that you know I realized I just
04:09 learned what I was taught in school and
04:13 I was really good at memorizing things
04:14 and deducing things and so I got famous
04:17 for regurgitating a bunch of crap that I
04:20 really never checked out I never really
04:22 thought it through and said this doesn't
04:24 make any sense and when I decided it
04:27 didn't make any sense
04:28 I changed my loyalties in this world to
04:32 [Music]
04:33 you know an unadulterated avenue of
04:37 information and I've done my own
04:38 research now I've worked with people ten
04:40 times as brilliant isn't me you weren't
04:42 on TV and I realized that I had a bunch
04:46 of things mixed up and the most exciting
04:47 part is polish and I think I'm on the
04:49 right track
04:50 I figured out gravity was a push not a
04:54 pull and it's just opened up the entire
04:57 universe I figured out the universe was
04:59 made of electricity based on ether winds
05:02 and boom my brain exploded and now about
05:06 what is he in his mid-50s or so he gets
05:09 to start over he gets to start over in a
05:10 super exciting world instead of waking
05:12 up every day and some you know I gotta
05:15 pretend I know this and I got to reader
05:17 Tate that nope he's totally happy and
05:20 he's totally renewed so that's the
05:22 benefit of coming out of crap science
05:25 you're only getting alkaloids by other
05:27 [ __ ] idiot people so what so everyone
05:31 who's stupid literally in the audience I
05:33 mean you want to have a stupid filter
05:35 put it on an audience just say raise
05:38 your hand if you
05:38 neil degrasse tyson's write about all
05:40 the stuff that he says majority write
05:43 about everything he says raise your hand
05:45 if any one of you thinks that you know
05:47 bill nye the douchebag guy is a real
05:50 [ __ ] scientist second the hands go up
05:53 boom there you go there's your [ __ ]
05:56 idiots in the crowd not getting children
05:59 don't know anything they could have [ __ ]
06:01 parents who don't teach them anything so
06:04 we're not talking about kids we're
06:06 talking about grown adults you should
06:07 know better I thought I would take some
06:10 of the theories that I piss on in the
06:12 show as being fake and slow down slow
06:16 down talk about in a little bit more
06:17 detail for you those of you who aren't
06:20 into a lot of the science details this
06:22 might be a little boring but I think
06:26 that I can I'm gonna try to do my
06:28 Richard Feynman impersonation which is
06:30 to say I won't speak in a Brooklyn
06:32 accent but I'm gonna try to make this
06:36 understandable by everyone or for
06:37 everyone right the first one we want to
06:42 go at is the Big Bang as I always say on
06:47 the show the Big Bang was a wonderful
06:48 theory that loud housewife's in the
06:51 mid-60s direction say late 60s early 70s
06:54 to believe that they understood how the
06:56 universe was created and I say
06:59 housewives not to demean women I say
07:01 that because we had a balanced family
07:05 unit and the mothers took care of
07:07 children they had education they went
07:10 out and got amazing jobs after their
07:12 children started going to school taking
07:14 the bus but they were busy working on
07:18 kids they weren't
07:20 the men that went out and you know and
07:22 had no choice but to work and work and
07:24 work and become scientists and aerospace
07:26 people early in life so even our most
07:30 incidental minds at the time for that
07:34 stage in their life you totally
07:36 understand how the universe was created
07:38 and that feels good right
07:41 I do believe that once we do figure out
07:43 the fundamentals of the universe we can
07:46 explain it to each other through a
07:48 five-year-old I can whisper to my
07:50 five-year-old and he can walk across the
07:52 street or walk across the room and talk
07:53 to mommy and he'll say the right thing
07:55 on the other side of mommy will
07:57 understand whatever it is and vice-versa
07:59 I keep waiting for that five-year-old
08:02 prodigy kid to solve all our issues or a
08:06 girl I'm in there
08:07 Joseph Campbell was a philosopher / I
08:12 think anthropologist
08:16 who
08:19 studied the inception 'el mythos of man
08:24 what does that mean he went around the
08:27 world and tried to find the earliest
08:29 stories the man told himself about how
08:33 the universe works spiritual beliefs
08:36 burial beliefs right if you believe
08:38 there's life after death and you have to
08:39 have a model in your brain for what that
08:42 is you don't have to but everyone seems
08:43 to find one right so we know that the
08:45 indigenous South Americans before the
08:48 conquistadors came over and crossbred
08:49 with everyone they had their own belief
08:51 system they have originally had their
08:53 own belief system all the African
08:55 sectors had their different ones etc
08:56 etcetera right so he started doing
09:00 interviews and stuff very early in his
09:03 career and if you want to really he's
09:06 very he's very slow in his tempo when he
09:10 does his presentation so you have to be
09:12 prepared for that but he is a brilliant
09:15 man he's dead now he was a huge
09:17 contributor to Star Wars even though if
09:21 you watch Seven Samurai he will find out
09:23 that storyline was really old but he
09:27 helped George Lucas put it all together
09:29 those of us who write screenplays yeah
09:32 you usually get into Joseph Campbell at
09:33 some point but one of the best
09:35 presentations he ever gave and I don't
09:39 think that he actually did what I'm
09:41 about to do when I've always done which
09:43 is compared to the Big Bang I'm sure he
09:46 thought of it just didn't quite want to
09:49 get into the controversy of it in his
09:51 class I believe I had this correct and
09:54 then he said that South America had the
09:56 story and Africa had the story and that
10:00 is that when God before the universe was
10:03 created God was asleep and then God woke
10:08 up and when God woke up he exploded
10:10 which is what I got off a way to [ __ ]
10:13 wake up
10:15 he explodes and his body creates the
10:19 entire universe
10:22 now there's a difference between the two
10:24 stories but the difference only happens
10:26 after the explosion occurs and one part
10:30 of the story and one version of the
10:31 story the planets and stars already
10:33 exist and it's merely the life force
10:35 that is us that lands on these particles
10:38 called planets and stars and I really
10:42 feel sorry for our cousins that landed
10:44 on the star but that's how we were
10:46 created now the the revision to the
10:50 story is that everything the stars and
10:51 this planets and the moons and
10:53 everything and us came out of God so it
10:56 was all just sort of meant to be where
10:58 the exploded guts of God how beautiful
11:00 is that theory but that's one of the
11:04 earliest tales of mankind trying to
11:06 explain what the hell happened it's
11:10 actually depending on what year that
11:12 story was told and we don't exactly know
11:14 when the story originated to my
11:16 knowledge it's brilliant to think the
11:19 Sun would look at the stars and find
11:21 splatter instead of diamonds in the sky
11:25 you know I mean they said well that that
11:27 looks like when I dropped that bowl of
11:29 milk and it spidered on the wall and I
11:31 was a bunch of dots on the wall of milk
11:33 and I thought oh wow dots dots explosion
11:36 crash boom bam right interesting right
11:39 so now we got to jump into a little bit
11:41 of science now gravity is at the very
11:46 core of this argument the definition of
11:50 gravity
11:52 now crap science has gravity as a pull
11:56 phenomenon go look it up in Wikipedia in
11:59 2018 if you're a hundred years from now
12:01 then it's probably been corrected
12:02 hopefully but gravity is not a pole it
12:08 is a push and we'll get back to the push
12:10 in a second but scientists said oh you
12:13 know we understand that mass attracts
12:15 mass those laymen out there well it just
12:18 for me means if you put two bowling
12:20 balls together in space they're gonna
12:23 bang into each other they're gonna suck
12:24 towards each other if you put a marble
12:28 and a bowling ball well the bowling ball
12:30 is going to pull heavier on the marble
12:31 than the marble pulling on the bowling
12:33 ball but eventually they'll get together
12:35 a smaller unit is going to be
12:38 subservient to the bigger unit because
12:40 there's more pull supposedly the pulling
12:43 implies what and pulling implies that in
12:45 within the atomic energy of something
12:47 that there's this magnetic attraction
12:50 between them but that also suggests that
12:56 there's some sort of communication
12:57 between all mass and universe that
12:59 somehow this you know the mass in this
13:04 this little microphone stand here is
13:07 talking to the rings of Saturn somehow
13:09 is in testable as it might be they're
13:12 talking to each other they're exchanging
13:14 information about where they are and
13:15 thus creating some sort of sucking thing
13:20 a pole now we know that in all of our
13:25 research of slamming protons against
13:28 protons and giant accelerators we're not
13:32 finding any any evidence of that
13:33 whatsoever we still see gravity work we
13:36 see when things collide and they spin
13:37 off from each other
13:38 sure well like look at that a spiral
13:42 thing when you take a step back from
13:45 that as a objective scientists and you
13:47 go that can't be that can't be the case
13:52 and for those of you have dove deeply
13:55 into electrical universe you might be
13:57 thinking oh but it totally is it's an
13:58 ecosystem of Van Allen belts
14:01 communicating with the Van Allen belts
14:02 and they're all kind of holding each
14:03 other together ah I don't disagree but
14:07 you need to understand that's the other
14:08 theory okay one of the neat exercises we
14:13 do in science and again I don't blame
14:14 someone for going down the path and
14:16 looking at a Big Bang Theory and have
14:18 really quick exercise but at some point
14:20 instead of getting goo-goo-eyed over
14:23 your theory that is based on crap you
14:27 pull all that was cute but that doesn't
14:29 it doesn't work like that so this theory
14:31 is kind of stupid in the first place but
14:34 here's the way the Big Bang Theory works
14:35 for those of you who never had it
14:37 explained to you apologize for those of
14:39 you who are into this but you're gonna
14:40 like the rest of it
14:42 if all of the mass in the universe
14:44 pulled on it's one another maybe if you
14:48 had just two atoms in space you're gonna
14:49 start banging against each other then
14:53 what would be the overall eventualities
14:54 of the theory and a lot of this I want
14:57 to bring in this analogy because it's a
15:00 very important fun little analogy which
15:02 is you know when you get some sort of
15:05 equipment and it's got a bunch of knobs
15:09 on the front you're not quite sure what
15:11 the knobs are could even be software and
15:14 you start playing around with it you
15:17 want to know what a particular knob does
15:18 what do you do we all do the same thing
15:20 we turn away up and then we done way up
15:22 and way down because then we're hearing
15:24 the difference right because that allows
15:26 oh that makes it clear well that makes
15:28 it really muffled that's really weird oh
15:29 look at the base the base goes really up
15:31 the treble goes way up okay so the Big
15:34 Bang Theory is someone coming up with
15:36 the basic theory of a pole and hey you
15:41 know supposedly it was the theory is
15:44 credited to Isaac Newton being
15:46 occasioned by the fall of an Apple the
15:49 cartoon stories that he was hit on ahead
15:50 by an apple
15:52 it's kind of funny so he's sitting in an
15:55 apple orchard watching things fall
15:56 supposedly he's the first person to ever
15:58 think about it but then again he's
16:00 British so it's about a 99.9% chance
16:03 that story's a lie but they took it to
16:07 11 didn't they they turned up the knob
16:09 as far as they possibly could and said
16:10 well what would happen if everything
16:12 pulled on itself
16:13 well eventually would it be logical that
16:15 regardless of how large the universe is
16:17 at some point it would all pull on
16:18 itself and what I'll pull itself to a
16:21 single point in space-time
16:24 everything would be yanked back to some
16:26 center point which on average would
16:28 probably be about the last time this
16:30 ever happened because there would be
16:32 sort of like the center of gravity to
16:34 the universe you know from where the
16:35 original explosion occurred and their
16:38 theory but again the idea is that we
16:41 actually understand the dimensions of
16:44 the universe like we understand how big
16:47 it is you know there's all these
16:48 theories I've heard since I was a little
16:51 kid like I think by 1982 Michael told me
16:53 well they think the universe is the
16:56 shape of a shoebox with a sinking lid
16:58 and you just listening to this [ __ ]
17:01 going oh and even as a little kid you
17:04 know we can feel the truth a lot easier
17:06 you know obviously my uncle's just
17:08 repeating what he had heard from someone
17:10 else
17:10 and I'm just looking am I going well we
17:13 know that's [ __ ] you know if they
17:15 don't have any [ __ ] clue how big the
17:17 universes or what shape it's in they
17:19 don't just because your telescopes can't
17:21 see any further doesn't mean jack [ __ ]
17:23 all right by the way I meant to say the
17:28 other day that the amount of telescopes
17:30 that we have especially the the big
17:32 radar arrays in the desert especially
17:35 the vatican's project lucifer array the
17:39 lack of images that we see from these
17:41 telescopes is almost absolute now when I
17:44 was a kid and they started building
17:45 those things we used to get all these
17:46 pictures having just bought in all those
17:49 rags I told you about it at the airport
17:53 I'll not say anything buy an astronomy
17:55 magazine and just a deep-space crap
17:58 we're seeing is sort of the Sofia
17:59 project
18:02 so I don't know which is the real thing
18:04 that's the Hubble telescope I'd seen all
18:07 its crazy amazing [ __ ] so yeah that
18:10 stuff doesn't work or they're porting it
18:12 like usual but the idea is that this
18:15 mysterious force continues to work until
18:17 it pulls the whole universe into what
18:18 they call a singularity which is that it
18:20 is the teeny as tiniest little thing and
18:25 we're talking about it has according to
18:27 and this is where it gets romantic this
18:29 is where scientists goddamn it's amazing
18:32 the balls these guys have or the lunacy
18:35 they have or both where they tell us
18:38 that everything in the universe is
18:39 crushed down to a pinpoint in space that
18:42 is so teeny tiny it essentially defies
18:45 all physics because that's smart when
18:48 you're trying to prove your own
18:50 discipline that it has no mass it
18:55 occupies no space it is the most
18:58 infinitely small thing and it must reach
19:00 this pinnacle teeny tiny pinprick in
19:03 space-time before it can explode again
19:09 pulling and pulling because if you have
19:12 a pull model you don't need any external
19:14 force on anything and you perceive the
19:18 atom as pretty much the grand object in
19:22 the universe and if you start doing you
19:23 know subatomic physics you'll get into
19:26 quarks and nuan's and gluons and all
19:29 these crazy [ __ ] right the god particle
19:32 and then miraculously at the point of
19:35 absolute perfection when this thing is
19:37 compressed down to be absolutely perfect
19:40 and remember they're not theorizing any
19:42 air bubbles in it any warts on it it's
19:45 not a you know a bizarre medicine ball
19:49 thing it is a hundred percent perfect it
19:51 explodes and when it explodes
19:53 well this random chaotic universe
19:57 happens which is where the Big Bang
20:00 Theory completely defies itself oh this
20:05 perfectly symmetrical object explodes in
20:07 the most uniform mathematical way
20:10 possible but what we get is an absolute
20:12 random
20:13 universe out of it uh-huh yeah yeah no
20:18 one ran Mathematica on that little model
20:21 we have life right we seem to have
20:25 chaotic ever-renewing patterns in the
20:28 universe
20:30 Stephen Wolfram's research that we
20:33 probably have somewhere between two to
20:35 three unique particles in the universe
20:39 categorizations of ether winds and then
20:45 we get pure chaos pure Steve Jobs once
20:50 went up to stage when he was talking
20:52 about the iPod and maybe even just been
20:55 talking about iTunes I think was talk
20:57 about the iPod though maybe was talking
21:01 about the shuffle feature on an iPad
21:05 which is where it randomizes what you
21:06 hear on your iPod and he said you know
21:10 creating random numbers is really tough
21:11 it's been doing it for years and video
21:14 games and all kinds of simulation
21:15 software because it we discovered it's
21:17 really tough and when we put it on a
21:18 musical musical playlist
21:20 he realized that even if you have a
21:23 thousand songs an iPod you're hearing
21:26 the same song but then a few hours
21:30 and so he's like well we work really
21:33 hard to make it more random because
21:39 random ain't easy baby
21:41 right yeah I will tell you this one of
21:45 the first things I ever programmed in
21:47 high school I should say first but
21:50 probably the third the first term who
21:53 has to know that the second term project
21:55 I have a program for another person in
21:56 high school so they could pass class was
21:59 a poker game and I had to shuffle 52
22:03 cards from a normal deck of cards and
22:06 the amount of random features that were
22:09 in computers were pretty primitive I was
22:11 on an Apple 2 computer Apple 2 plus the
22:15 kid actually failed not because the
22:17 software didn't work right but because
22:19 my teacher could smell my code it was
22:22 funny but it's an eye-opener it's a
22:25 freaking eye-opener when you have to
22:26 really make sure that the user feels
22:28 like something's random so anyway we got
22:31 a random universe out of it we got a
22:32 chaotic universe out of it which means
22:34 that they're very theory itself or
22:35 ghosts of how much you want to mulch it
22:38 and modify it
22:39 it's not true the gravity ain't a pole
22:44 it's a push and that's the first thing
22:47 you learn when you come out of it and go
22:49 back to the original theory of gravity
22:52 when gravity is a push the theory
22:56 completely falls in on itself and
22:58 there's some beautiful regulators when
23:01 it becomes a push versus the pole and
23:02 appo algorithm you could actually
23:04 theorize the creation of a singularity
23:07 which in its it's infantile stage of
23:11 becoming a singularity you have things
23:14 like black holes that they use to scare
23:16 the [ __ ] out of all of you guys right Oh
23:18 a black hole is gonna swallow up the
23:23 universe it's gonna be a bunch of black
23:24 holes floating around the universe and
23:26 they're all gonna you know sub collect
23:30 to each other it let's let's take a
23:32 little diversion into black holes before
23:35 we get back to what would be the
23:37 limitations on a Big Bang Theory with a
23:40 push ether a model of gravity
23:43 is essentially creating negative
23:44 pressure pockets between e3o wins I
23:47 should say we used wind because it's a
23:50 theory that we can all wrap our minds
23:53 around it but most likely isn't
23:54 necessarily a wind but it is a ambient
23:58 three-dimensional force of moving
24:01 subatomic or I wouldn't even say atomic
24:05 but sub particle theory and we'll get
24:07 back to that but a black hole is said to
24:11 be theorized to be possible to exist
24:14 between a star that is four times as
24:17 large as our star that's the minimum
24:19 amount it would take to start creating
24:20 this black hole the singularity before
24:24 that if your mass one through mass three
24:28 point nine you're going to get a brown
24:30 dwarf neutron star this is going to
24:33 collapse but it won't be able to
24:34 collapse to the point where it can
24:36 swallow up the the actual verbal
24:39 reaction that is photons right when
24:41 photons try to come off of agitated
24:45 thermalized matter it's only has so much
24:47 force to wiggle itself away from its
24:50 source that's creating this reaction and
24:53 at mass four they've theorized on paper
24:56 that the photon ripple which is like you
25:00 know again when we throw a rock into a
25:02 pond the ripples are the photons so I
25:04 say go get me some ripples you look at
25:08 me really funny and that's when I that's
25:10 all it should feel if you're a physicist
25:11 and I say go out get me some photons you
25:13 can't harvest photons you can only
25:16 create them you can create control them
25:19 right I can control
25:21 Ripple's in a bucket of water with my
25:23 hand just keep tapping it and create as
25:25 many as I want sort of what an LED does
25:28 but it can go all the way up to I
25:31 believe amass 12 so 4 through 12 gives
25:35 us 8 units of size and once you go over
25:40 12 the mass of our star times 12 you
25:43 start getting such an explosion when it
25:47 comes together the theory is that will
25:48 just keep collapsing exploding like a
25:50 mini Big Bang now what's interesting is
25:53 both the Big Bang and black holes have
25:55 if you talk to decent physicists they
26:00 have atomic limitations the way that
26:04 they have actually started to dialogue
26:06 about this about 40 years ago that I
26:08 know of was to say okay let's take time
26:13 as a mechanism to study the physics of
26:15 what would be happening in one of these
26:17 bone-crushing pull theories of mass and
26:22 so they'll get down to the point where
26:24 they're dealing with a nanosecond of
26:26 time within the Big Bang so we you've
26:30 got to kind of theorize down to like you
26:32 know the last 800 nanoseconds of the of
26:35 the singularity creating a simple Ford
26:37 explodes but we can't get the physics
26:39 starts to break down we can't actually
26:41 allow particles to do this because we
26:43 know they don't because we look at
26:45 experiments in the laboratory as it is
26:47 above so - it is below but they just go
26:50 ahead with the theory well we'll figure
26:51 it out eventually I mean went over right
26:53 should even though nothing actually
26:54 matches reality we're making a lot of
26:56 money off this right for those of you
26:59 who know Douglas Adams it's a bunch of
27:01 majiggy I was talking to each other
27:02 about the answer just make it up
27:04 [ __ ] yourself so the black hole is
27:08 very similar the black hole starts to
27:10 create and it's funny because it's been
27:12 different a million times you know when
27:15 it first came out in the 1770s I believe
27:19 you know it was a ball that was going to
27:21 trap light and then it went to an
27:23 einstein-rosen bridge where it became
27:25 this funnel like in the movie black hole
27:28 by Disney back in 1978 you could drive
27:32 through it and we've seen that you know
27:33 every other movie is
27:35 it's got like a funnel and you're gonna
27:38 go into the black cone you're gonna pop
27:39 out in some other part of the universe
27:41 and the einstein-rosen bridge theory was
27:44 was invented because it sort of
27:46 throttles the problem of a crushing
27:48 bunch of mass energy when time ceased to
27:53 be an illusion created by perception
27:56 which is really the beauty of general
27:57 relativity they started treating it like
28:00 it really exists and it doesn't really
28:05 exist I know that sucks and your brain
28:07 you're like [ __ ] it does exist man I was
28:09 a child once so yeah you were but that's
28:13 just your perception man it's just your
28:17 perception so when they started playing
28:19 with space-time they started saying well
28:21 we can create all these dimensions of
28:23 wind [ __ ] is and this is where you start
28:27 to get wormhole theory and it's not like
28:30 a wormhole can't exist but the idea that
28:33 simply because mass hits a point where
28:35 supposedly the gravitational pull is so
28:38 heavy that it keeps photons within some
28:41 orbital loops such that no one can see
28:42 it outside of it now the thing is if you
28:44 got right up on a black hole and go
28:46 inside the event horizon it's gonna get
28:48 bright as hell really quick because all
28:50 of the ripples of photons are going to
28:52 be in this bubble it's gonna be super
28:55 bright when you get really close to it
28:57 by the time you're gonna get sucked into
29:00 it if it's truly a pull so all this mass
29:03 comes together and again the shapes have
29:05 changed but if we just get rid of the
29:06 einstein-rosen bridge sort of sci-fi
29:10 television funnel thing and go back to a
29:13 ball or what eventually was theorized in
29:16 the 80s which it becomes a disc it
29:17 really becomes like a flying saucer
29:19 looking shape because it's spinning the
29:22 inner
29:24 equator is the plateau it becomes that
29:27 that saucer-shaped edge and right on
29:32 along the edge something magical starts
29:33 occurring because this is where the
29:35 photon can't escape and this is where
29:38 physics got it's really funny they get
29:43 to a point where they create a
29:44 playground where they can [ __ ] about
29:46 absolutely [ __ ] anything and no one
29:48 can no one can argue with them Stephen W
29:53 Hawking can take it all the way the edge
29:54 and because he's brilliant at theories
29:57 on paper they started saying that you
30:01 know antimatter is created at the very
30:03 event horizon where mass and energy
30:05 it's very fundamental components or
30:08 ripped apart and antimatter starts
30:10 creating itself alright they could say
30:14 Teletubbies start creating themselves at
30:16 the event horizon and what intellectual
30:19 means do you have to argue the theory
30:21 against and and here's one of the
30:25 Bombers about science okay and it's it's
30:28 not necessarily a bad thing but let's
30:30 say you're enjoying your life you live
30:33 in these backyards like I do and you're
30:35 just having a good time with family and
30:36 friends and some dude comes around the
30:38 corner with a bunch of pocket protectors
30:40 and broken glass of tape on him and a
30:42 notepad there's a little you know so
30:44 [ __ ] iPad he's drawing on and he's
30:47 like oh my God he's theorized we've only
30:49 got five minutes to live and you look at
30:51 this guy going what oh my god it's
30:54 horrible it's horrible sky is falling
30:56 I'm Chicken Little
30:57 whoa he freaks out all your guests and
31:01 they all run home you know thanks
31:04 [ __ ] so what is this theory you have
31:07 well it's taken me years to come up with
31:09 this theory
31:10 five minutes goes by and [ __ ] happening
31:13 but now you got to go walk to all your
31:15 row all your friends that left your
31:17 backyard from the barbecue and go look
31:19 this guy was [ __ ] [ __ ] remember
31:21 you said five minutes and look it's fine
31:22 you go off you feel okay alright this
31:25 guy's full of [ __ ] and that's the
31:27 average science community today
31:29 look at me I'm important I'm the [ __ ]
31:31 nerd it's attention-getting [ __ ] it's no
31:36 different than the people who say
31:37 there's
31:38 but they can't predict a goddamn thing
31:40 so the big that the black hole theory
31:43 continues to evolve and again it's a
31:45 mini Big Bang really because eventually
31:48 what they say is okay I said that
31:52 there's limitation between 4 and 12 of
31:55 you take stars that are four times as
31:57 big as our Sun to 12 times as big as our
31:59 Sun and all by themselves eventually
32:01 they lose their atomic ability to be
32:04 stars and when they start to collapse on
32:06 themselves they don't supernova they
32:08 just become black holes that's the
32:10 theory so what you know that's not
32:14 exactly in a benign thing in space right
32:18 it's gonna have a huge gravitational
32:20 pull because we have this pole theory
32:22 going around and so it could drive by
32:25 one of our solar systems and it would
32:27 suck us up in two seconds eat our Sun
32:28 and [ __ ] a flash and our you know we
32:31 would literally earth would just
32:33 disappear in a matter of seconds if not
32:36 nanoseconds right rift apart
32:39 oh wow we've created a super villain in
32:42 the universe now but they continued the
32:45 theory and said well what if he had two
32:47 black holes to mass twelve black holes
32:50 bumping into each other what would
32:52 happen then now the true theory of this
32:55 is that if it does maintain a disk shape
32:57 of any kind its rotational speed would
33:00 be out of this world probably way faster
33:03 than the speed of light and some of the
33:06 bang into each other it's gonna be a
33:08 light show it's gonna be amazing
33:09 they're gonna combine they're gonna have
33:13 a mass 24 black hole and that theory
33:17 just keeps going and keeps going until
33:18 the harbinger of all you know Big Bang
33:23 Theory is going to be a bunch of these
33:24 things banging into each other but
33:27 someone has some balls in the late 80s
33:28 and early 90s to finally do the math on
33:30 this thing these black holes and said
33:32 you know what I don't think it's going
33:35 to do this I think the way that mass in
33:37 a pole model of gravity attracts itself
33:40 will start to create a funnel in the
33:43 center of this disk object so instead of
33:46 having nice bubble over the center of
33:48 our UFO it's going to create literally
33:49 like a cone going down and
33:52 the center and there should be one on
33:53 the bottom because it's equal top of top
33:55 and bottom physics are very fairly
33:57 unified in its behavior the mathematical
34:01 models that hold it all together and
34:03 then what's going to happen is it's
34:04 going to create a little funnel so see
34:06 everything that's vector down to this is
34:07 going to spew up and spew down way
34:10 outside of this black hole and it's
34:12 going to create some super-heavy
34:14 elements I think they were talking about
34:15 like helium 23 which is an extremely
34:20 heavy version of helium there's a lot of
34:24 theories about what what atomic elements
34:26 that would create it but very quickly as
34:29 soon as it created itself it would
34:30 diffuse itself back into the universe as
34:33 this heavy element just floating around
34:34 space because the velocity would be so
34:37 absolutely heavy the amount of distance
34:40 that stuff would travel at the top and
34:42 bottom it would be very difficult for
34:46 this mass to find itself again in the
34:49 universe again it's all just theories on
34:52 paper people so it's really interesting
34:55 about it is that the same exact science
34:58 the same exact theoretical physics that
35:00 it punched a hole in the black hole
35:05 would apply to the Big Bang 100% but now
35:11 what if gravity is a push not a pull
35:19 one our detailed episode on gravity go
35:21 look at it just look up gravity on this
35:23 channel and for those of you don't know
35:26 how to search on videos you go to the
35:28 channel on YouTube or you go to the
35:30 website deep thoughts radio calm you go
35:33 in the search field you type gravity on
35:35 YouTube you've got to click the channel
35:37 homepage then you get the search field
35:39 which searches within my channel and you
35:40 type the keyword you'll find it right
35:42 well what gravity I think really is
35:44 because it starts to solve all of our
35:47 freaking problems in physics it no
35:49 longer is a phenomenon is that we have
35:50 this stuff called
35:51 ether it is the only particle that
35:54 exists in the universe
35:55 period everything that you see is
35:58 nothing more than classifications of how
36:00 this stuff behaves right as I've said
36:02 several times on the show if I point to
36:04 a spinning vortex of water and I say
36:06 what is that and you go oh that's a
36:09 vortex of water and I said no it's just
36:12 water then you look at me and you're
36:14 like what you're just an [ __ ] I said
36:17 well you know what I'm asking you how
36:19 that behaves aren't going to be asking
36:21 you what is that
36:22 the what is that answers its water see
36:26 how it behaves it's a vortex and so
36:30 that's how we come up with protons
36:32 neutrons electrons everything in the
36:34 universe even a quark is all how this
36:37 stuff behaves how it spins in space I
36:41 wouldn't Engels itself from space such
36:44 that you can say that as a proton that
36:48 is a photon photons are more elusive
36:51 because again just like in the ripples
36:53 of water in a pond it's still water but
36:57 it's also ripple but you can't go get
36:59 the ripple and ripples only exist for a
37:01 certain amount of time why isn't the
37:05 universe completely white because we
37:07 can't get all of this the light being
37:10 created in space from every single angle
37:12 because it does cancel out it does get
37:14 weak and it does go away when we have
37:17 telescopes with bigger lenses and
37:19 cameras with better CCD bladders or
37:23 whatever they can
37:26 grab more light and then we see deeper
37:29 into space okay but we see gravity and
37:33 our Cheerios don't we when T Rios float
37:37 on the surface of your milk and your
37:38 bowl you'll see them go pink and they
37:41 attract to each other you put your spoon
37:43 in there sometimes and it tracks now
37:45 there's a water tension issue to that as
37:48 well but you'll see it go to the edge of
37:49 your bowl and hang on to the bowl edge
37:53 again a lot of that's water tension in
37:55 the curvature of the tension on the
37:57 water but a lot of it has to do with
37:59 relatively speaking in a 2-dimensional
38:01 Cartesian coordinate system a
38:02 2-dimensional plane gravity is able to
38:05 demonstrate itself right in front of
38:07 your face the earth attracts the moon
38:10 because the earth is blocking the winds
38:12 of the universe from its backside such
38:16 that there is a negative pocket of
38:18 pressure between the moon and the earth
38:21 and so the moon is forced because it's
38:23 getting hit from its back side and every
38:25 single 3-dimensional angle it can
38:27 towards the earth and the only place
38:30 where there's a negative pressure
38:31 meaning a little less push on the moon
38:34 is between the bone and the earth the
38:37 Earth rotates around the Sun because
38:38 there's a little less pressure between
38:41 the Sun and us and that's how everything
38:43 holds together and I wanted to say
38:46 publicly for those and I went down with
38:49 this in one of my episodes of Flat Earth
38:51 but
38:53 one of the false fundamental things you
38:55 start thinking about gravity is that
38:57 it's just air pressure that we're inside
38:59 some snow globe and it's the air pushing
39:02 down on us and that's what pushed to
39:03 earth the proof that that's not the case
39:06 is that when they take a glass container
39:08 or some plexiglass container so we can
39:12 see inside and you put a feather in
39:14 there and it goes to the bottom of the
39:16 container like well of course it does
39:17 because air pressure in the container is
39:19 pushing that feather to the bottom okay
39:23 it's inside a vacuum sealed chamber and
39:27 supposedly there's orientation down well
39:30 if we seal that chamber up then what's
39:34 holding the air down right so that's the
39:37 first proof that there's something
39:40 passing through the chamber there's
39:41 praying orientation to the bottom to the
39:43 Earth's surface right but then we can
39:45 easily vacuumed out all the air out of
39:47 the chamber and the feather still stays
39:49 on the bottom of the chamber it falls a
39:53 little faster because there's less air
39:54 to bump into as it's falling so the
39:56 feather will fall like a paper clip
39:58 inside a vacuum
39:59 that's so falling down that's because
40:02 ether exists ether is so teeny tiny and
40:05 moves at 50 times the speed of light
40:07 that it travels through the container
40:09 and pulls it down why is he getting
40:10 pulled to the bottom of the container
40:12 and why is the container holding to the
40:14 table why's the table holding to the
40:15 ground because the earth is displacing
40:20 all the ether pressure that would push
40:22 it off the surface of the earth because
40:24 the earth is got so much mass so much
40:29 current right spinning currents right
40:31 just like the drain in your water that
40:35 it is having more pressure push on it
40:39 down then they can push up to make it
40:42 levitate because the earth is so huge
40:44 the earth is still permeable to ether
40:48 meaning ether who can go straight
40:50 through the earth in all directions but
40:53 there's more pressure pushing down than
40:55 anything pushing up so it winds right
40:58 when you have someone arm-wrestle with
41:00 someone else well you still lose if you
41:04 lose right you still win if you win but
41:07 they're still pushing the loser is still
41:10 pushing back but their arm is pegged on
41:12 the ground right why is that because the
41:15 arm that's winning is a hell of a lot
41:16 stronger right a lot of you will know
41:20 that they have revealed off and on about
41:22 every twenty years that there's this
41:24 mysterious force that comes out of the
41:26 earth this mysterious anti-gravity force
41:29 that comes out of the earth but they
41:31 never they never explain it and it is
41:34 the it is two things it is the I would
41:39 say the dielectric energy force were
41:41 ethers coming down bounces off the earth
41:43 and comes back up it's very minimal as
41:46 most of it gets absorbed
41:49 and it's the other ether that goes all
41:51 the way through the earth and comes out
41:52 the other side it's very very light it
41:55 is the losing arm Russell person in this
41:58 equation
41:59 but how can a singularity exist and how
42:02 can a big a blackhole exist if it's all
42:05 a push on a black hole it makes a little
42:09 more sense that you could get something
42:10 kind of like that because you'd have a
42:12 bunch of ether around the black hole
42:15 there's still a bunch of stuff out there
42:17 in the universe and maybe a current can
42:19 get so intense that pretty much light
42:22 gets stuck in some orbital pattern but
42:24 again you go back to the liquid dynamics
42:28 of mass energy and you're gonna get this
42:31 dissipation thing that Stephen Hawking
42:33 talked about
42:36 but when it comes to a big bang oh now
42:38 you got a big problem how does all the
42:41 mass in the universe get compressed into
42:44 a singularity when you need the mass of
42:46 the universe /e throw winds to push it
42:49 into that spot in the first place
42:51 there's a lot of circular logic problem
42:53 here you can't have a bunch of stuff
42:55 outside of all the stuff that's inside
42:56 when they're supposed to be the same
42:58 exact thing pushing on this object with
43:02 the pull theory you can start to
43:04 compound the force because you're
43:06 bringing your accounting for everything
43:07 coming into this little tiny spot in
43:09 space and it can get stronger and
43:11 stronger and stronger because the force
43:13 is within that singularity it is
43:16 creating its own force when you go to an
43:18 external force of gravity you can only
43:22 put so much stuff in the middle so much
43:24 current could only so much current could
43:25 exist in the middle and then it's just
43:28 gonna sort of top out because how does
43:31 gravity work in a push model okay well
43:35 you certainly have a certain amount of
43:37 volume of displacement right so you have
43:39 a diameter volume of displacement it
43:41 could be a pretty weird-looking asteroid
43:43 it could be a perfect circle like the
43:44 earth but then there's the density of
43:48 the object that also controls that
43:50 permeability we talked about the feather
43:53 in the container and the fact that I'm
43:54 sitting in a chair if Earth was mostly
43:58 like a gas inside there's no plasma core
44:02 that holds off II throw winds then we
44:06 might be on sort of that fake moon
44:08 footage right we're all kind of floating
44:10 around right because there's still a lot
44:12 coming out from unto the bottom of the
44:13 earth and so we kind of weigh a pound
44:16 for every hundred pounds that we weigh
44:18 we're like Superman I could just jump to
44:21 the beach doesn't mean it's gonna happen
44:24 really quickly but it's like any one of
44:27 those video games where you kind of get
44:28 the flying feature a little bit of
44:30 gravity
44:32 but thank God planets are the way they
44:34 are now I'm tempted to call this the Big
44:37 Bang episode which I wanted to do but
44:40 here's the thing to go back to our crap
44:44 science meter if you believe in the Big
44:48 Bang and you believe that gravity is a
44:50 pole and not a push you can study it
44:52 your entire life you could live to be
44:54 200 years old and as long as you're a
44:56 closed-minded scientist who's trying to
44:59 impress the ladies with your pocket
45:03 calculator [ __ ] you're never gonna find
45:06 the truth because you're so off base and
45:09 there's a there's going to be a
45:11 singularity of humility once you finally
45:15 pull your head out of your ass and
45:16 figure out that gravity is a push and
45:17 not a pull
45:18 but when you get a bunch of trophies and
45:21 awards and alkalis and you get to speak
45:23 at various means and people like comic I
45:24 see so intelligent before believing the
45:27 wrong thing man trying to pry that out
45:30 of the hands of a scientist is the
45:32 heaviest form of gravity you'll ever
45:35 find right so an electrical universe
45:39 which I mentioned at the beginning of
45:40 the episode all of the paths of
45:44 electricity and anything is designated
45:46 as some sort of fundamental energy of
45:48 the universe is literally dictated by
45:52 these ether oil pockets of positive and
45:54 negative pressure the magnetic poles
45:57 that come out of things the
45:58 electromagnetic poles that come out of
45:59 things it's all controlled by the
46:02 various properties of ricocheting Mass
46:05 you know the Ricochet is you shoot a
46:07 bullet it hits something it bounces off
46:09 that's dielectric energy and then you
46:13 have your orbital patterns of behavior
46:15 which is where you get your electron
46:19 clouds you get your moon and your earth
46:21 your earth and your Sun one of the worst
46:24 things that happens in craft science and
46:26 it's it's sort of tough in the past but
46:29 now it's really easy with 3d software is
46:31 that all these three-dimensional
46:33 concepts have been portrayed as
46:35 two-dimensional objects in paper
46:38 diagrams and your science books so
46:39 everyone gets everything off because you
46:42 have an advanced intellect of man to
46:45 think in three dimensions
46:46 space unless you're a special-effects
46:49 person or you're dealing with a lot of
46:51 simulation software it's one of the
46:53 beauties that Stephen Wolfram's
46:55 application Mathematica has allowed
46:58 scientists to evolve their brains to
47:00 think of things in 3d but give you a
47:03 really funny story you know when my
47:06 close friends is Syd Mead s yd MEA decom
47:11 go check him out he's a futurist
47:14 designer he is designed movie after
47:16 movie after movie but he's also designed
47:18 objects he's done planes and yachts and
47:20 cars and television sets but he's done
47:23 Blade Runner Tron Star Trek aliens to
47:26 short-circuit robot on and on and on
47:29 Elysium Tomorrowland this guy's on fire
47:33 he did Las Vegas Blade one or 2049
47:38 he's a genius he paints in watercolors
47:40 he draws with a normal pin on paper and
47:46 one of the things those of us who are
47:47 close to him have figured out is that
47:49 Sid thanks in 3d Sid has played instant
47:53 3d applications in his lifetime but he
47:55 to my knowledge hasn't ever really
47:57 created a finished product of 3d meaning
48:00 hey I did my latest vehicle design in 3d
48:03 he has people like me that will do it
48:05 for him after he creates the top bomb
48:08 left right front back illustrations of
48:11 them right but as an industrial designer
48:15 I've seen people who are you know famous
48:19 for the exact same thing they're the top
48:22 four designers the top whatever
48:24 designers other movie designers like
48:25 Oliver shuru and they they'll look at me
48:30 and they'll go that dude has been
48:32 thinking in 3d since he was like I mean
48:34 without exaggeration in his early
48:36 probably late teens early 20s and it was
48:39 that perception that Sid had that that
48:41 ability for him to hold a model in his
48:43 brain in 3d and never forget I brought
48:46 that tube over the hood right if he was
48:48 designing the DeLorean and back to the
48:51 future okay he would remember where
48:55 every single switch in knob was you
48:56 could rotate it in 3d and he likes to
48:58 design things asymmetrically I mean he
49:01 left does not match the right top does
49:03 not match the bottom he loves that
49:04 because that's more organic and more
49:06 believable it is that method of thinking
49:10 that we really haven't quite gotten the
49:13 entire population to pop - hey people
49:16 think about things in 3d space because
49:20 we haven't advanced the minds of man
49:23 these scientists who do think in three
49:26 dimensions or don't are able to draw a
49:29 shitty little diagrams about how things
49:31 work and everyone believes it for any of
49:34 you've ever dabbled in astronomy I
49:36 guarantee you there was a moment from
49:38 your infancy to your adulthood when
49:42 someone finally told you you know that
49:43 diagram of the universe that they're
49:45 sorry the solar system they show you
49:46 with the Sun and the nine planets
49:49 yeah [ __ ] that Pluto being an asteroid
49:52 [ __ ] and they said well you know the
49:55 sizes aren't the same guys if you were
49:58 to draw the solar system at the scale
50:00 you would see it on a even a landscape
50:04 book you couldn't see almost all the
50:08 plant you see the gas giants but you
50:09 wouldn't be able to see much else and
50:11 even the gas giants you need a little
50:12 magnifying glass to see it on the page
50:14 you wouldn't be able to see Mercury
50:15 Venus Mars Jupiter sorry Mars wouldn't
50:19 be able to see Pluto at all
50:22 and there's that mindfuck where you're
50:24 like oh wow you're right things are a
50:26 lot bigger than I thought they were when
50:30 you have the Epiphany of how small
50:31 everything is in relation to other big
50:33 things in the universe
50:35 at least as they've theorized them and
50:39 do realize that I understand that I'm
50:40 I'm building this entire episode out of
50:43 the overall heliocentric model of the
50:46 universe it still has value regardless
50:49 if that's true or not right so I'm going
50:52 to throw one more thing into this
50:54 initial episode of crap science as we
50:56 got we're gonna keep a crap science vol
50:58 1 is the speed of light and its
51:03 stranglehold on the mind of man so the
51:07 speed of light is this very interesting
51:08 thing in the 20th century due to one
51:12 super plagiarizing wife-beating cousin
51:15 marrying dude named Albert Einstein I
51:19 promised 50 episodes ago I'd do an
51:22 episode on him and I'm very close to
51:24 going ahead and doing that if any of
51:26 you've seen Peter Sellers and being
51:28 there if you haven't seen that movie
51:31 being there watch it it's weird
51:34 and that's Einstein he sat as a clerk
51:39 and a patent office in Europe and saw
51:43 the geniuses of Germany and France try
51:48 to file a fee arete achill patents he
51:51 had his mind opened he denied the
51:53 patents ripped them off and just like
51:56 Joseph Smith creating his own religion
51:58 in upstate New York
52:00 that's Einstein you think oh that
52:04 couldn't possibly happen he's
52:05 peer-reviewed blah blah blah well yeah
52:07 he's being peer-reviewed against other
52:10 German and French designers other
52:15 thinkers when I mean hey think about it
52:19 if you hadn't heard of general
52:21 relativity special relativity or even
52:25 quantum mechanics and I right now could
52:27 teleport myself back to what is it in
52:30 1895 or whatever just with my layman's
52:33 knowledge of it right now I would
52:36 Albert Einstein in one year because I
52:39 could just plagiarize everything I've
52:40 ever heard I wouldn't have to completely
52:43 totally have all the answers and then I
52:44 could spend 40 years 50 years of my life
52:47 perfecting my [ __ ] and everybody
52:50 like he's so smart he helped invent the
52:53 nuclear bomb that's evidence he's a
52:55 genius
52:56 you like well he created a equals
52:58 mc-squared oh I know he didn't that's
53:03 more of the plagiarizing and again he
53:07 couldn't complete basic math in college
53:08 he had rosin and a three what two other
53:11 guys do most of his mathematics form so
53:15 how did he come up with equals
53:16 mc-squared
53:17 when if you put him in front of a board
53:19 with calculus he wouldn't know what he
53:21 was looking at that's just above ground
53:23 knowledge right but they did create this
53:27 energy equals mass mass equals energy
53:31 epiphany of what I think the people who
53:34 created the pyramids understood a long
53:36 time ago Wow what you're basically
53:40 saying in a very theoretical off you
53:43 skated way is that we're all made of the
53:45 same stuff you genius you now what is
53:49 the theory equals mc-squared what are
53:51 those things stand for energy equals
53:53 mass times the speed of light squared
53:56 okay here's my cigar man take it now
53:59 move this at the speed of light squared
54:01 go ahead do it take any object in your
54:05 house right now and your car and move it
54:07 at twice the speed hairs be light
54:09 squared go ahead and do it oh you can't
54:12 offend Jesus I guess you can't prove
54:14 that my theory is right how convenient
54:18 I sound really smart and you can't do a
54:21 goddamn thing to prove it speed of light
54:25 squared
54:26 that sounds really fast by the way
54:30 it's the speed of light times the speed
54:32 of light okay but he drops this equation
54:36 and then all of a sudden they realize if
54:38 they put a bunch of very chaotic in a
54:43 chaotic mass like uranium 234 and 235
54:48 into a container which we call well we
54:52 refine it to the point it's just as pure
54:54 as it could possibly be which is an
54:56 atomic particle with 234 to 235
54:59 bits and pieces electrons that it can't
55:03 hang on to itself it's constantly
55:06 emitting this radiation just ask Madame
55:08 Curie who died of it and if you compress
55:11 it Wow something happens again we're not
55:15 convinced that stuff ever actually
55:16 happened it may just be a theory on
55:18 paper and they just use TNT to blow the
55:20 [ __ ] out of everything all right but out
55:25 of that theory it says that if you try
55:28 to move any object to the speed of light
55:32 that you will run out of the amount of
55:34 mass required to push that object and it
55:38 can never achieve the speed of light
55:41 it's romantic isn't it that this would
55:45 be some byproduct of some energy to mass
55:47 conversion algorithm when I was in high
55:51 school I took physics and I know it
55:54 sounds lame but I had one of the most
55:55 amazing teachers on planet earth mr.
55:58 Goering which they would say Goering
56:00 which is funny he was a genius he was an
56:04 absolute genius he's still alive
56:07 but he gets to that point in the class
56:09 and I'd already had guess about seven
56:12 years of studying this on my own time I
56:15 lived in this stuff and
56:20 you know what I actually I talked to him
56:22 once about 20 years ago and I I was just
56:26 having the conversations checking in on
56:27 him because I hadn't talked to him in a
56:28 long time he didn't live in my hometown
56:29 he lived 17 or 27 miles away something
56:34 like that and he said you know the most
56:36 frustrating thing about you was that I'd
56:38 be trying to teach the class something
56:39 and you'd start reading the just off the
56:44 top of your head you start reading me
56:45 all the paragraphs other books that
56:47 you've read and it was like I couldn't
56:49 keep track I couldn't keep control of
56:51 the class because that was the most
56:52 funny and frustrating thing about you
56:53 but he goes the more I thought about it
56:55 after class it was pretty cool little
56:57 trick you know I'd only say that so you
57:01 understand how much I knew as a teenager
57:03 right this guy had been teaching this
57:06 stuff for 20-plus years probably almost
57:09 30 years now when it came to the class I
57:13 remember what he's teaching Eagles
57:14 mc-squared thing and he goes into the
57:16 limitation of this mass being able to go
57:20 the speed of light I dread just just had
57:23 crest over I don't even know what books
57:25 I was getting into or material I was
57:27 watching because there's no internet
57:28 they didn't have a giant book collection
57:30 at home stuff I had heard some talk and
57:34 some chatter about that just simply
57:36 being wrong and that by simply accepting
57:39 it on a piece of paper because someone
57:41 tells you or a black board all of our
57:43 brains get closed all of our minds get
57:44 closed so I raised my hand he's like I
57:49 know Christ here we go yeah and I said
57:52 well what if he's wrong
57:55 what if this entire equation is just an
57:58 equation just a theory and it's braum
58:00 and he got real pissed off because he's
58:04 like god dammit I have to teach this
58:06 theory the way it's been written into
58:08 the history books and you're gonna be
58:10 messing it all up with your question man
58:13 and then I believe I was watching some
58:16 interesting sort of home footage out of
58:18 some guys out of Cornell University some
58:22 theoretical physicists that essentially
58:24 had and I you know it's up there on
58:26 YouTube probably but Christ it was 15
58:28 years ago most people cancel their
58:30 accounts after a few years but they were
58:34 talking about a vortex and the fact that
58:37 when energy goes down into a vortex it
58:40 starts to spin faster and faster and
58:41 faster and they come up with a complete
58:44 theoretical model that proved using
58:48 electrical energy theories that have
58:50 been existing for seven years before
58:54 physics quote-unquote started to erase
58:56 all this stuff with their other theories
58:59 right so electronic theory is observable
59:01 and provable in a laboratory whereas
59:03 physics theory is just a bunch of [ __ ]
59:05 on paper for the most part per capita
59:09 and once I saw this lecture there's
59:11 these kids were just filming themselves
59:13 in their university in a classroom with
59:15 just like two or three of them they were
59:18 drawing these beautiful diagrams on the
59:20 board and talking about what we know
59:22 about how electricity works and right
59:25 before your very eyes you saw them prove
59:27 that things can travel faster than the
59:28 speed of light in addition Eric Dollard
59:32 I'll say his name over and over and over
59:35 you got to get into this guy he's an
59:37 amazing human being he's still alive I
59:40 hate to think he's as old as he is
59:43 because he has personally awakened us to
59:48 the masters of the universe the
59:49 electronic masters of the universe as I
59:51 always say Faraday - Tesla - Steinmetz
59:55 he built on video in 1988 and I believe
59:59 what's called the borderland group it
60:03 was uh I think it was in
60:05 los altos or palo alto are somewhere in
60:09 the bay area in his basement with a
60:11 couple other very astute gentlemen and
60:13 they did tons of experiments go look up
60:15 eric Dollard di e RI c do ll ard and
60:20 borderland it's a bunch of like VHS sort
60:23 of videos home you know camcorder videos
60:26 but one of the most brilliant things he
60:27 does is he creates a longitudinal
60:31 circuit on a table now to review a
60:36 transverse wave is like when you take a
60:39 rope and you flip it you know and you
60:42 see that wave go all the way down the
60:43 rope but again it's like oh that's like
60:45 a photon and then you have a
60:46 longitudinal wave which is when you take
60:48 a broomstick and you're holding one and
60:50 i hold the other and i go boom and i
60:52 punch it and you immediately feel it on
60:53 the other side there's no waiting for
60:55 the wave to get to you and so he
60:58 demonstrated very quickly that all the
61:00 electronics in the world operate on
61:02 transverse waves this delayed thing now
61:07 you all know that when you plug in a
61:08 string of lights Christmas lights to
61:13 your 60 second 60 frames per second
61:16 brain that light comes on that whole
61:19 string of Lights comes on
61:20 instantaneously but if you were to slow
61:23 down and shoot it with one of these
61:25 super high cameras super high-speed
61:26 cameras is doing a million frames per
61:28 second it's going [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] as
61:32 the electron VAT of valence the
61:35 stimulation of sort of the chainsaw
61:37 blade of the outer electrons on the
61:39 surface of this conductive wire that's
61:41 inside there it starts rotating all the
61:43 electrons so they like a chainsaw blade
61:46 just goes in circles around anything
61:47 that's conductive if you're touching
61:49 something as shocking you it's going in
61:51 a chainsaw blade technique on the
61:52 conductive surface that's why it's
61:55 conductive gold is really conductive
61:57 copper is pretty good two other things
62:01 aren't okay so he does a he hooks up
62:08 voltage meters he hooks up Oslo scopes
62:10 and he starts to study the time it took
62:13 for the circuit to transmit to the other
62:17 side of this other circuit
62:19 and they built these beautiful circuits
62:22 that are configurable and you could turn
62:24 them in one orientation and connect them
62:26 all together and you get a transverse
62:27 wave and then you turn them and connect
62:29 them together and you get a longitudinal
62:30 wave of electricity
62:31 I'm gonna forget exactly the the numbers
62:35 but I'm gonna get really close he does a
62:38 transverse wave circuit which is what
62:40 all your computers are made out of what
62:41 your phone is made out of what the world
62:42 is made out of and I think it was about
62:44 point eight to 82% this big of like
62:50 let's book that way so everything that
62:53 we're running all the equipment you're
62:55 seeing me on right now is all running
62:57 below the speed of light
62:59 sublight speed and the reason why is
63:01 that the valence the method of the of
63:03 the wave of electricity is in this
63:05 transverse wave which is slow but it's
63:07 also limited to the actual you know
63:09 resistance of the materials that we use
63:12 right resistors are things that slow
63:14 down electricity and slow down the
63:16 amount of electricity they can travel
63:17 over them right controlling the circuit
63:21 requirements the voltage requirements
63:23 are the components that are inside of an
63:25 electronic device right okay
63:27 then II reconfigures it to a
63:29 longitudinal wave and you can watch him
63:33 do it you can watch him do it on camera
63:35 okay then he runs the same exact test
63:38 it's essentially like light of light
63:40 bulb at the end of the table sort of
63:41 thing instantaneously in front of your
63:45 eyes he travels he makes that he doesn't
63:48 personally travel but he makes the
63:49 circuit complete itself 11 times the
63:52 speed of light right in front your face
63:56 now you would think that that would be
63:59 on the front page of every single
64:01 scientific rag in the world and that
64:04 post 1988 every single device in the
64:07 world would be built with longitudinal
64:08 circuits now it could be that we'd have
64:12 to work on cooling circuits because that
64:15 you know moving electrons at that speed
64:18 I don't know if it creates more thermal
64:20 energy or not maybe it would heat up
64:22 everything and melt everything but the
64:24 circuits were doing just fine on this
64:25 table
64:26 they look pretty meaty so it's it's
64:29 almost like the difference of using
64:30 silicon versus some tube technology
64:33 if you look it up you'll find that the
64:35 speed of light is measured differently
64:36 all around the world but because we have
64:38 this theoretical standard of how fast it
64:40 works we just keep reporting it is it
64:44 one hundred eighty two thousand feet per
64:46 second or something like that right
64:47 super fast now someone might contest
64:51 okay smarty-pants
64:53 you're talking about electrons versus my
64:56 shoe maybe Einstein is just simply
64:58 saying my shoe can't go the speed of
65:00 light yeah electron still is a noun in
65:05 one designation of Sigma five CERN
65:09 accelerometers Ignatians right so it's
65:13 not a ripple necessarily if you do study
65:18 ether model you'll start to find out a
65:20 disturbing truth which is everything is
65:22 a verb everything the old analogy that I
65:26 put forth in the gravity up was so which
65:28 I've never heard taught anywhere else is
65:29 that what I do point at that current in
65:31 the in the river and I do the whole
65:34 experiment with you what is that you say
65:36 it's a current I say no it's just water
65:37 but even if we both sit there and agree
65:39 yeah you're right it's a current but if
65:42 I put red dye a couple feet up the
65:43 stream here comes the red dye jump a
65:47 whole bucket of you know red stuff in
65:50 there you see it go down into the vortex
65:52 and then go down the river okay the
65:57 current stays right there but it is used
66:00 a renewing supply of water to create
66:02 itself right you can't get a drain in
66:05 your spinning vortex of water and the
66:08 drain in your tub to just stay there and
66:11 not move it's got to be moved it has to
66:14 have a resupply of water going down a
66:17 drain to exist and that's how the whole
66:22 universe works as is above so - it is
66:26 below for those of you who believe in
66:28 any model of the universe that is non
66:30 heliocentric you can't deny the way that
66:34 your drain works and your bathtub so if
66:37 you want to believe any other sort of
66:39 religious model of the world or whatever
66:43 I assure you that these rules work all
66:46 over this environment craft science
66:50 we've got to start in doing crap science
66:53 and we're not the first to start undoing
66:55 it even if we created a revolution as a
66:57 result of this episode we're sort of the
67:00 citizens down below the those that are
67:02 dedicated all day long to doing it but
67:06 now let's finish the episode talking
67:07 about the resistance towards crap
67:10 science why there is resistance to crap
67:13 science the benefits of crap science to
67:16 those who peddle it we try to make a
67:20 statement when we live right we do we
67:27 get born we live some people are humble
67:30 and beautiful and they just simply want
67:32 to contribute to their circle of life
67:34 their kids their loved ones maybe just
67:37 themselves and when they expire they're
67:40 like man that was a good journey I had a
67:41 really good time I ate some apple pie
67:44 once I went to Disneyland once that was
67:47 cool I got to see the benefits of a
67:48 bunch of creative people in science and
67:50 creativity and storytelling that was
67:52 kind of cool I met a girl once that I
67:54 fell in love with and then a boy that I
67:56 fell in love with maybe I got to end my
67:57 life with him at my side those are the
68:01 most balanced human beings on this
68:02 planet in my opinion those are the
68:05 moments that we Revere because something
68:08 wonderful is occurring your heart gets
68:09 involved the very substructure of I
68:11 think consciousness which is love swims
68:14 around inside all this ether will wind
68:16 right but now let's just say you're a
68:19 little awkward for whatever reason the
68:23 perfect storm happened and you're a nerd
68:28 you don't look maybe right for society
68:32 to accept you or maybe you're handsome
68:34 this can be but you just can't figure
68:35 out how to put clothes on you can't
68:37 figure out how to comb your hair but for
68:41 whatever reason the stimulation that you
68:43 get from a book of science is pretty
68:45 much the same stimulation someone else
68:47 gets from watching porn definitely
68:50 recommend the former over the latter
68:54 and when you start to talk about all
68:58 this stuff that you've memorized you
69:00 start getting alkaloids you start
69:02 getting rewards people start going well
69:03 in he or she's really smart i watch the
69:06 Jeopardy in an airport the other day
69:08 yesterday and it was interesting how you
69:16 only get a score on that show if you buy
69:19 into revised history and pop science
69:22 take a crap science in a lot of ways and
69:25 sure they have a lot of factoid things
69:27 that are absolutely true where is the
69:29 Nile who was president of this
69:31 particular time who wrote that book
69:32 that's all good knowledge you care about
69:35 that information
69:38 been every once in a while there'll be a
69:39 category about science and then you hear
69:41 a bunch of [ __ ] they get they're
69:43 getting money in the show they're
69:45 winning the show because they're willing
69:47 to answer the questions according to the
69:49 accepted quote-unquote facts of the
69:52 universe there are dozens and dozens if
69:55 not hundreds and hundreds of stories
69:57 where someone actually discovered what
69:59 was really going on in this world and
70:00 they were persecuted for it and sadly
70:05 it's in every category of life right
70:07 you'll find people that like Bruce
70:09 Lipton a prodigy medical student who
70:13 when he started to figure out that
70:14 everything well I shouldn't say
70:16 everything a lot of things that he
70:18 learned in medical school and he took it
70:19 to the laboratory and tried to prove it
70:21 he realized it was wrong
70:23 got excited that he had figured out that
70:26 that we were wrong took it to his ten
70:30 year professors who run the place and
70:32 said oh my god I got this we're gonna be
70:34 one of the most popular universities in
70:35 the world because I've uncovered that we
70:37 were wrong and with this new
70:39 understanding we can heal people
70:42 and he was let go from the University
70:44 and had to move to Guam there are
70:47 historical warriors out there who have
70:50 the open mind to question everything
70:53 that's ever been claimed in history but
70:56 there are 14 countries that won't let
70:58 you question certain parts of history
70:59 lest they put you in jail
71:01 so people have died in prison in Europe
71:04 because they simply had the balls to ask
71:06 a question others that didn't go into
71:09 history but didn't go into jail but they
71:11 went into hiding for 20 years recently I
71:14 think they popped out they're still not
71:17 invited to talk about what they've
71:19 discovered they've proven beyond the
71:21 doubt the scientific facts about the
71:24 claims of history in certain pockets
71:25 certain decades of our recent history in
71:29 the last hundred years
71:32 they're not being revered but they're
71:34 the smartest people on this planet when
71:36 it comes to thinking original thoughts
71:38 lobbying and doctor needed and really
71:40 trying to write down in a book what
71:43 really occurred and what really could
71:44 not have occurred in history okay I know
71:48 you can feel it already right what's the
71:51 difference between someone who becomes a
71:53 professor in a college having never
71:54 worked in the private sector and someone
71:56 who has to actually work in the private
71:57 sector and make things work all right
72:02 well if you're a theoretical scientist
72:05 in the academia world working as a
72:08 professor writing paper after paper
72:09 about theoretical possible truths one
72:13 you can't afford to have someone walk in
72:15 the room one day before you publish your
72:17 paper which is going to fulfill one of
72:19 your fiduciary responsibilities for the
72:21 university to provide alkaloids for the
72:25 University income for the University you
72:27 can't have someone walk in the last day
72:28 and go you know what you're completely
72:30 wrong all this pop crap science that
72:32 you're basing your new theory on is just
72:35 more crap who's gonna get attacked the
72:39 guy who wrote the shitty paper that's
72:40 going to perpetuate more lies or the
72:42 person's coming in saying you're wrong
72:45 there's only one of the people usually
72:48 walking in saying you're wrong and
72:49 there's a [ __ ] ton of people saying
72:51 you're that the other person who's wrong
72:52 is right hawking made a whole life of
72:56 this stuff I'm gonna give Stephen W
73:01 Hawking some credit though I'm gonna
73:03 give him the benefit of the doubt that
73:04 he actually didn't believe everything
73:06 that he was forced to write down or
73:08 maybe he had written down on his behalf
73:09 in some cases we don't know I saw david
73:12 blaine do a trick for him in the last
73:14 five years of his life and he seemed to
73:16 be very cognitive in the chair
73:18 david blew him away with a card trick he
73:20 smiled and we watched him use his his
73:24 apparatus to talk and he said amazing
73:26 David Blaine and you can hate that guy
73:30 you can love that guy but goddamn it he
73:32 is one of the most amazing magicians
73:33 illusionists to ever live doesn't mean
73:36 everything he's ever tried to spend that
73:37 impressive but god damn his street
73:40 tricks is closed hand magic is second to
73:44 none
73:45 some people get to a point when they
73:49 really want to be known for being smart
73:51 and I want to say that that's a fine
73:54 goal to have it really is but I have
73:59 close family members who are like this
74:01 who have literally like psychoses
74:03 related to the fear of being dumb and if
74:06 you so much as question anything that
74:09 they say you'll see them meltdown I mean
74:12 I've seen people utterly meltdown and
74:14 try to jump out of moving cars I'm not
74:16 joking because the word dumb was used
74:19 loosely towards one of their ideas being
74:23 delayed versus being enacted on I was
74:26 saying the idea was great but I think it
74:28 was done that they were going to delay
74:29 sharing that idea with the world pretty
74:33 innocent it's sort of a backhanded
74:35 support statement right I think you
74:38 should go for it man I think that's
74:39 brilliant I think it's dumb that you
74:41 would hold it back so we're done was
74:43 spoken this jump by the [ __ ] car
74:44 what's moving sorry I personally
74:47 experienced this psychosis at a ultimate
74:50 level
74:50 so almost almost willing to take their
74:52 own life being associated with that word
74:55 and any any any tense of any use of the
74:58 word bizarre I'm willing to bet that a
75:02 lot of folks would have the same
75:04 reaction who have built their whole
75:05 life's out of this academia world but
75:08 what happens when you have to live in
75:09 the real world and you have to make your
75:12 science quote unquote work in jelly's
75:18 theories [ __ ] man if you're just living
75:19 in paper well [ __ ] what do you have to
75:21 prove Eric dullard split it apart for us
75:24 and he said well you know what you can
75:26 make transverse waves work on circuitry
75:28 you can
75:29 that's what everything's built out of
75:30 it's a shitty way to move electrons
75:32 you should go longitudinal circuits but
75:35 you can make it work with your bad idea
75:38 certainly sells a lot more units of
75:40 electricity doesn't it how many cycles
75:43 of electricity do you pull from the
75:44 power plant in a transverse circuit to
75:46 render an image in 3d products a lot but
75:50 if you had a longitudinal circuit and
75:51 you're rendering the same thing oh
75:52 you're done you're done in one eleventh
75:55 of the time
75:58 it sounds like you're selling less
75:59 electricity doesn't it we know that
76:01 bankers and corporations that try to
76:03 control us do not want us to be smart
76:08 they're fighting us every step of the
76:10 way if you watch rollerball 1975 with
76:13 James Caan it did a whole episode on it
76:15 you should watch Jonathan II the
76:19 fictional characters James Caan is
76:21 playing is trying to find books that
76:22 tell him how the world really works how
76:24 executive decisions are made how the
76:25 structure of the upper management of the
76:27 world works
76:27 you can't getting the books because
76:29 they've been rescinded out of the
76:31 library and paraphrased to keep us
76:34 stupid
76:35 in exchange the corporation says well we
76:38 built a beautiful life for you why do
76:40 you need to know this information you
76:41 don't alright that's a philosophical
76:44 attitude towards knowledge for any of
76:48 you who have ever been loyal to
76:49 Microsoft Windows or the Apple operating
76:51 system you'll know how this goes
76:54 once Microsoft totally dominated the
76:58 operating system world with Windows 95
77:00 they may get Windows 98 out and it was
77:03 pretty much really solid didn't crash
77:05 much it was great
77:06 Apple was being run by Gil Amelio he was
77:09 destroying the company single-handedly
77:11 eventually Steve Jobs comes back and
77:14 says you know what I'll do two more
77:16 versions of this old operating systems
77:17 last version nine was the worst but I'm
77:21 gonna bring you my next operating system
77:22 I've been working on for nearly ten
77:24 years
77:24 and you're gonna love it when he
77:28 released OS 10 and no one paid much
77:31 attention to it Steve Ballmer said oh
77:33 it's just a warmed-over mock UNIX kernel
77:36 alright
77:37 but eventually version 2 came out 3 came
77:40 out in 4 came out 5 came out and all of
77:42 a sudden this [ __ ] started getting tight
77:45 now Microsoft had a problem they were
77:48 way behind the curve of the Internet but
77:51 that's what happens when you allow
77:53 someone to nominate knowledge they just
77:55 say well we're forcing everyone to buy
77:57 Windows if you want to run any operating
77:59 system on a Windows computer which is
78:01 97.5% at the time you don't have any
78:06 choices so [ __ ] you that's what they do
78:10 American car has got really crappy in
78:12 the 70s and in the 80s
78:15 well Japan came in and said we got
78:17 something called Toyota and Honda we're
78:18 gonna eat your [ __ ] lunch right in
78:20 front of you you know when we lost World
78:22 War 2 or sorry when we won World War 2
78:24 and they lost what war 2 their generals
78:26 on the boat outside of Japan and they
78:28 signed the treaty to give up to
78:30 surrender they said we're gonna take you
78:31 over by all financial means necessary
78:33 same byline of the Skull and Bones back
78:36 in 1834 both of them made it come true
78:42 trust we had a bunch of shells in our
78:44 government handing over everything that
78:45 we made
78:46 all right to get decent science out we
78:51 have to understand crap science we have
78:53 to understand the entire mechanism of
78:55 crap science people living in
78:56 theoretical models versus people living
78:58 in the real world if you want to sell me
79:00 the iPod 2.0 some amazing new invention
79:02 that does music and gives me a five
79:05 cents brainstorm session with my music
79:08 you're gonna have to make science really
79:11 work anyone has ever been sick with
79:13 cancer you won't pay attention to this
79:17 pop science crap science thing until
79:19 you're sick with cancer and you visit
79:20 your oncologist and they tell you that
79:22 okay you're gonna really hate all the
79:25 methods we have to cure you of cancer
79:28 once you go to the Internet and start
79:30 searching on b-17 and the Gershom
79:33 technique and thermal techniques and
79:35 vitamin C and all this other stuff all
79:37 these means that will absolutely cure
79:39 you of this stuff depending on your
79:41 stage of cancer course and your
79:43 dedication to the regimens you realize
79:48 you don't have to lose you here you
79:49 don't you peek your guts out and you can
79:51 get cured fully cured like no more in
79:54 your body at all but it's super sobering
79:57 when someone in your family dies the
79:59 cancer super sibling I think most of you
80:03 would agree that man on earth is a very
80:06 special creation well perhaps in the
80:12 next volume of this episode go after
80:14 evolution and there's something from
80:15 nothing theory it's a lot of my episodes
80:17 okay but if we're to preserve this
80:21 actual byproduct of man that is supposed
80:23 to be amazing we're gonna have to get
80:24 off our lazy asses and start taking an
80:26 active role in knowledge most of you
80:29 listen to the show you're doing it every
80:30 single day you're preaching to the choir
80:32 I'm trying to give you guys some more
80:35 sort of scientific thinking theories and
80:39 open-mindedness
80:41 to go on your own journey to bring in a
80:43 lot more disciplines than I will ever
80:45 cover on this show if I were to rebuild
80:48 this society from the ground up we're
80:52 gonna have to start thinking again we're
80:54 gonna have to start rejecting paradigms
80:56 of
80:57 striction because that's what academia
80:59 brings us is closed mindedness
81:02 not open-mindedness how many times have
81:06 you heard papers on you've read them in
81:09 magazines you've read them online where
81:11 they say there's all kinds of dimensions
81:13 to the universe no we're up to 30
81:15 dimensions the universe you're like man
81:16 that sounds really cool but when I walk
81:19 in the room when I go what do what do
81:20 they mean by dimensions of universe tell
81:22 me professor like well I don't know it's
81:25 just it's there out there
81:29 make sure you're not that guy you're not
81:30 that girl if you want to start passing
81:33 around these pop science theories of
81:35 dimensions of reality explain it to me
81:38 what do they mean you know if you read a
81:42 paper what's funny is you can read an
81:43 entire like four-page article in
81:45 Scientific American
81:47 dimensions of reality and at the end of
81:49 the article when you see the little that
81:51 little square little black squares is
81:53 that's the end of the article you have
81:55 no clue what they were talking about the
81:57 whole time
81:57 and you could have a PhD and all the
82:00 disciplines of that science and at most
82:03 you'll have some sort of apparition of
82:05 what they were talking about in your
82:06 brain that's sort of felt real I mean he
82:09 definitely use the standard jargon from
82:13 that era from our era you know I feel
82:16 like I'm smarter I've never had a
82:18 conversation where someone talks about
82:20 the dimensions of reality I'd have won
82:21 the last month talking to a very
82:23 brilliant man and he started well you
82:26 know we have like we're up to like 30
82:27 plus dimension is thirty three
82:29 dimensions you know that's very masonic
82:30 of you but when i said well what do you
82:33 mean nothing zero not even the first
82:37 inkling of what the hell he was talking
82:38 about but I'm willing to bet that
82:40 conversation happens once every two
82:42 weeks out of that guy does it makes him
82:44 sound smart he's already talking in
82:48 words that are sort of above the
82:49 intellect of most people but he doesn't
82:51 know what he's talking about he's doing
82:53 jeopardy what is thirty dimensions don't
83:00 be that person I think you feel me I
83:03 could talk forever on this subject I
83:06 love this subject if you haven't been to
83:09 deep thoughts radio Calm please go
83:11 there's a locked Facebook group there's
83:12 audio video and a patreon page take care
83:16 of yourself in someone else and I'll see
83:17 you in the next two dots over
