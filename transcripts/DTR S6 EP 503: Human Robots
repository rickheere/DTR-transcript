00:01 [Music]
00:14 so
00:19 [Music]
00:27 [Music]
00:33 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:34 gentlemen
00:37 it's a nice cool evening not too bad
00:39 still pretty warm in california during
00:41 the day
00:41 i hate moving this mic because it makes
00:43 all this i can't hear a thing but you
00:45 guys are all the bumps
00:46 and there's nothing more annoying than
00:48 when i'm watching someone else
00:50 [Music]
00:52 so i apologize if i bang the mic during
00:54 the episodes
00:56 so today we're going to talk about
00:59 quite frankly the literal question
01:04 are there human robots among us
01:09 the cage asked jack black
01:13 in their first tenacious d album do you
01:15 think there's
01:16 uh robots among us he says no
01:19 we don't have the technology anyway he
01:22 changes the subject
01:24 so your instinct might also be to say
01:27 that
01:28 but it was funny when he asked that
01:30 question it was such a
01:32 random question in the middle of this
01:34 album
01:35 of tenacious d i think it was released
01:38 around 2002
01:39 or so i actually saw him in concert i
01:42 saw a concert twice
01:44 once at blizzcon and before that um
01:48 on their maiden album tour
01:52 but i recently saw a
01:55 conspiracy video that was suggesting
01:57 this
01:59 and it was a gentleman who put together
02:01 kind of a collage of all of these
02:03 moments when you have celebrities
02:07 especially
02:08 and this is from sports celebrities to
02:12 newscasters and what have you and they
02:15 freeze on television
02:18 now sometimes i think it's just somebody
02:21 staring
02:22 off into the distance other times i
02:24 think it's like shaq
02:26 on some espn show he's just goofing off
02:30 then you have those folks that
02:32 disintegrate on camera
02:34 the woman that was reporting i believe
02:36 for the grammys she was outside
02:39 and she's all bundled up in this kind of
02:42 cashmere coat and she's she just
02:46 disintegrates on camera and every word
02:49 she said
02:50 was absolute nonsense and you just
02:53 wonder
02:53 like whoa is this woman having a small
02:55 stroke
02:56 what's going on here was it al roker
03:00 he did this freeze frame stare forever
03:05 that could be you're just tired as could
03:07 be and
03:08 you know you gotta stare at the camera
03:10 and maybe he's such a pro
03:11 he's been doing it for 35 plus years i
03:13 think and he's just
03:15 trying to look pretty for the camera but
03:16 he's also thinking about it again i hate
03:18 this job right now
03:21 there was a celebrity uh
03:25 sports guy and i i don't know from
03:27 sports i apologize but he was standing
03:31 getting makeup put on his face and the
03:33 dude was just frozen
03:35 and the makeups going on he wasn't
03:36 blinking
03:38 and it just seemed like uh
03:41 it was a little too much in the
03:44 paralysis
03:45 mode to look normal now there's a whole
03:49 half of this observation that is that
03:53 they are
03:53 mk ultra and that very well probably has
03:57 more
03:58 likelihood where they've gotten their
04:03 their trigger word they're being
04:06 programmed
04:07 and then the trigger word is spoken
04:09 again or the exit trigger word spoken
04:10 again and they
04:12 say whatever they need to say but that
04:14 seems like a lot of work
04:15 to be doing live on tv when's your
04:18 program beforehand
04:20 maybe there's some mandate there but
04:23 when i saw the
04:26 intro graphics for
04:30 the hbo series westworld
04:34 where for those of you haven't seen it
04:38 you see this i mean it's just a
04:40 beautiful theme song i mean
04:42 really the intro to all three seasons
04:44 regardless if you like the show at all
04:45 it's just
04:47 on a level of mastery it's artistic it's
04:50 functional
04:52 but they have this these robotic arms
04:54 and this was all stolen out of
04:56 fallout 4 by bethesda the video game
05:00 they actually successfully sued hbo for
05:03 stealing
05:04 this concept where they um they had da
05:07 vinci's
05:09 sorry leonardo da vinci means from
05:13 venice but leonardo's
05:17 man illustration where the guys got his
05:19 arms out you know
05:20 showing the proportions of men but they
05:23 strap this
05:25 basic infrastructure of a human being
05:30 into a unit and then they build on top
05:34 of the mechanics the muscle tissue
05:38 just using some sort of rubber ceramic
05:41 or whatever it might be
05:42 it's it's all white in the uh in the
05:46 intro because it was all white in the
05:47 video game and then once they build
05:50 on top of the bones all the muscle
05:52 tissues
05:53 they then dip it in this milk which
05:56 becomes the skin
05:59 and of course they never really explain
06:01 in westworld how it
06:02 goes from milk to flesh tone especially
06:05 with all the imperfections and what have
06:07 you
06:08 but you start looking at that even
06:11 though it's art
06:12 you start looking at it going wow
06:15 they could do what we're seeing in this
06:18 intro at least physically
06:20 they may not have everything else which
06:22 we're going to get into that would
06:23 construct a human being
06:27 my background is pretty good for giving
06:29 this a good run
06:31 i study electronics initially just as a
06:35 shady tree
06:36 electronics guy with my dad we fixed all
06:38 kinds of stuff
06:39 for money and then when i moved to
06:42 california i enrolled in a robotics
06:44 correspondence course believe it or not
06:46 because it was 1987
06:49 and studied electronics that way which
06:52 gave me formal electronics knowledge
06:54 and then in the last uh say four years
06:58 i jumped back in through arduino
07:00 raspberry pi
07:01 stuff and start looking at what's out
07:03 there
07:05 and of course it uh isn't that
07:07 sophisticated within those systems and
07:09 then of course for the last 10 years
07:11 we've all been monitoring boston
07:12 dynamics
07:15 uh for the last 20 years i've been
07:17 monitoring sony's progress
07:21 and so you can go to disneyland and
07:22 actually go to the what's called the
07:24 exploratorium which used to be the
07:27 mission to mars which used to be the
07:29 [Music]
07:31 future of tomorrow or something like
07:33 that
07:34 and they have the sony robot which you
07:36 can watch this pretty lame demo
07:39 of what it does which is basically less
07:42 than what a high school student does
07:43 with their arduino these days
07:45 but i've also been involved with various
07:49 software projects related to artificial
07:51 intelligence
07:53 so we have some fun here so
07:56 i know what you're thinking if you're
07:58 pretty technical person you're thinking
07:59 dude i've
08:00 i know you know if if you're like me you
08:03 might say well
08:05 i know how far ai has gone i know how
08:07 far boston dynamics goes why wouldn't
08:09 boston dynamics be making
08:10 full-fledged humans and yeah trade shows
08:13 have these
08:14 god-awful basically elaborate blow-up
08:18 dolls that
08:19 you know you'll hear this you'll see
08:20 this article and they bought the article
08:22 the company buys the article on the
08:24 front of whatever news organization
08:25 you're sucking down
08:27 and it's like you know just horrible
08:29 rubber
08:31 uh epidermis is on top of these robots
08:34 and they don't look
08:35 you know they remotely look human for a
08:37 split second until you really focus your
08:39 eyeballs and you're like
08:40 you know it's totally fake and then
08:41 their their movements are all horrible
08:43 and their mouths don't
08:45 it's just bad everything that's out
08:46 there's bets you might think
08:48 if this was possible
08:51 one of these companies would have
08:52 figured it out someone would have a
08:55 superhuman
08:56 and i mean really human-behaving robot
09:00 so since we don't that's case in point
09:03 this can't be done
09:06 all right how do
09:10 inventions like this occur though
09:13 there's usually two paths that they take
09:16 there is a steady
09:18 organic development within universities
09:21 within geeks at home who spin off
09:25 companies they use
09:26 maybe something else to make money and
09:28 they are engineering something in a
09:30 basement
09:31 and you have just this amalgamation
09:36 just like microcomputers right they
09:39 went from mainframes the size of
09:42 you know entire floors and this is just
09:46 even in the mid 70s all the way to
09:49 personal computers that started blowing
09:51 up in the 80s and as
09:52 gaming demands rose
09:56 and then eventually special effects rose
09:58 up microcomputers got a tremendous boost
10:01 all these video cards the gpus are used
10:04 to harvest bitcoins i mean
10:06 there's all kinds of pressure on the
10:08 industry to keep going keep going keep
10:10 going
10:11 and even then intel makes a chip
10:15 that's roughly about five to ten times
10:18 faster
10:19 than the chip you have in your computer
10:21 even though it's the same exact chip
10:23 and all they do is they internally clock
10:25 it slower and slower and slower
10:27 and then they're unlocking the clock
10:29 over the course of five to ten years so
10:31 you don't have to innovate a new chip
10:33 it's all hobbled by design and all the
10:36 geeks know this which is why they
10:38 overclock
10:39 quote unquote their cpus and their gpus
10:41 because they know it can handle more
10:43 they know they just need to work on
10:45 cooling it off
10:46 which is why you have liquid-cooled pcs
10:49 now
10:50 with the mac you don't get any options
10:52 it runs as fast as they let you
10:54 and there's nothing you can do about it
10:56 which is why windows software
10:58 can do more than mac software when it
11:00 comes to sheer power these days
11:02 and i'm a mac guy who's converted to
11:03 windows lately
11:05 the other scenario is you have a tesla
11:09 a person who is seeing more than
11:12 everyone else is
11:13 he or she is extremely enlightened
11:18 and they just i don't know whatever it
11:21 is
11:21 they see the patterns of invention
11:25 within the limitations of man
11:28 meaning man wants to make full-blown
11:31 replicant androids
11:35 first probably being more like data on
11:37 star trek next generation
11:39 and obviously getting to the nexus line
11:42 that the tyrell corporation created in
11:43 the movie blade runner
11:45 indistinguishable from men
11:48 these tesla characters there's a few
11:52 ways that they exist
11:53 and one is more rare than the other
11:57 one is that they're smart beyond
12:01 their technical prowess and they
12:03 understand
12:04 the forces of the world that would
12:06 descend upon them
12:08 should they invent something way beyond
12:12 what man understands as possible
12:15 meaning if any one of you create a
12:17 zero-point energy system
12:19 and you post it on the internet and you
12:21 prove it
12:22 your house will have more black suits on
12:24 it within minutes
12:26 than you could possibly imagine and i
12:28 mean minutes
12:30 they don't mess around
12:33 but if you're smart you do it like some
12:36 of the twilight zone guys who create a
12:38 robot in their basement
12:40 there's a great twilight zone this dude
12:42 creates a robot in the basement and he's
12:45 got this assistant he's been taking care
12:47 of him and he's so mean to her
12:48 there's a spoof on that and creep show
12:50 by stephen king
12:52 but what ends up happening is he tells
12:54 her she knows that when
12:56 he dies she inherits the mansion and all
12:58 of his money
12:59 so he's just persecuting her the whole
13:01 time
13:02 then he dies and uh there's part of his
13:06 will that he
13:07 she goes downstairs and opens his door
13:10 which then reveals this robot
13:13 which is i think robbie the robot with a
13:15 different head on him
13:17 and it's at first it's really kind of
13:20 dumb
13:21 and that eventually it takes on his
13:23 personality and he
13:25 he rules the house again and she's in
13:27 prison again he's a jerk
13:30 and so that's another technique which is
13:32 hiding in your basement and creating
13:34 this kind of stuff
13:36 now if you were the government that
13:38 would really really want this
13:40 and this is this is not counting
13:43 external intervention from perhaps
13:46 aliens you know it's what's really
13:49 interesting is the grays have been
13:53 categorized as robots which is really
13:56 funny because
13:57 if they are robots then all the fake
13:59 autopsies must suggest that they are
14:01 organic robots and therefore
14:03 just as good as what i'm talking about
14:06 but they never have had like the
14:08 clatto and gort relationship right
14:12 clatty was the human and
14:13 and the the erston steel and gort was
14:16 the robot
14:19 so if you were the government
14:23 or even you know a secret
14:26 rothschild trillionaire person who's
14:29 like
14:29 i want this find me the people who can
14:32 get it done
14:34 and money is no object you want a
14:37 billion dollars
14:38 whatever there's a billion dollars
14:40 whatever you want set up a facility put
14:42 it underground so no one can find it
14:45 and just whatever you want you got it
14:48 just get it done that's possible too
14:54 but now think about it this way
15:00 if you're making this in some covert way
15:06 you wouldn't want anyone else to know
15:07 you're doing it
15:09 so that's an easy concept right but what
15:12 if
15:13 you wanted to disinfo anyone else
15:17 as to what your maxim is in this
15:20 particular
15:22 realm of technology let's say you're the
15:26 united states
15:27 it's just an example
15:30 underground they i'm just going to make
15:33 this up
15:35 let's say they put aside 50 billion
15:38 dollars which should be enough to really
15:41 spike this project because they're going
15:43 to create it they're going to create a
15:44 replica they just are
15:46 they won't stop until they do if it
15:48 takes them 50 or 100 years they're going
15:50 to do it
15:52 so what they do to make sure that russia
15:56 china europe do not catch on that they
15:58 have advanced technologies
16:01 that can make this happen is that
16:03 obviously
16:05 anyone who touches a piece of technology
16:08 meaning they invented that would
16:11 that would be a staple to this replicant
16:14 project they swallow them up really
16:16 quick they invite them into the project
16:18 or
16:19 kill them off but you know inventors
16:21 typically
16:22 love the concept of having infinite
16:24 budgets
16:27 and they make a darpa
16:30 funded boston dynamics
16:34 which is just it's doing a good job but
16:36 it's not
16:37 funded properly it doesn't really have
16:41 um the goal of making humans humans
16:45 replicate humans and so that's sort of a
16:48 look we are making progress here but see
16:51 how far back it is from actual blade
16:53 runner replicants
16:55 meanwhile in a basement you have
16:59 this coming together slowly but surely
17:03 so i made an episode called building a
17:04 ufo long time ago
17:07 which by the way has become an extreme
17:09 tool for me in conversations with
17:10 friends
17:13 and i just put together logistically
17:16 how to make a ufo and i did a second
17:19 follow-up episode
17:22 which is space travel and i refer back
17:25 to it
17:26 i wish my blender skills have been where
17:27 they are today the graphics would have
17:29 been so much better
17:33 so how do you logistically break this
17:35 down
17:36 let's pretend this is our old deep
17:38 thoughts technique
17:39 again if we had deep thoughts university
17:41 somewhere in the planet this is what we
17:42 would do
17:43 just because you got to break down what
17:47 a human body
17:47 is well
17:51 there would be a few things we know a
17:53 ton about the human body don't we
17:56 now the human body has all kinds of
17:58 requirements
17:59 breathing blood all this stuff
18:04 i mean there's if you hurt the outside
18:06 skin it bruises
18:08 because you busted all the capillaries
18:10 and you've
18:11 maybe busted some veins inside your body
18:13 you're bleeding around
18:14 inside your body turning purple until
18:16 things heal up and
18:17 everything seals off or the veins die
18:20 and reroute
18:22 we're amazing amazing creation right but
18:25 if we're going to make a robot why would
18:26 we make it with any of those
18:27 dependencies
18:29 we sure as hell wouldn't make it eat
18:31 food
18:32 i mean we might make it capable of
18:36 taking in food and simply
18:39 mulching it up to the point it could
18:41 waste it out some normal orifice like
18:43 the human has but we wouldn't make it
18:45 dependent
18:46 on sugars carbohydrates complex sugars
18:50 fats so the first design charter is to
18:53 remove
18:54 all of the limitations and requirements
18:57 and dependencies that the human body has
18:59 i mean why put that in there it's more
19:01 work for no benefit whatsoever
19:06 now of course we all we will get to a
19:08 point where we discuss
19:11 the facsimile and the fraud that is
19:14 the epidermis and hair and teeth and
19:18 eyeballs and things that the people can
19:20 see
19:21 fingernails we'll get there
19:25 but initially we're going to make sort
19:27 of the
19:28 droney kind of robots that you end up
19:30 seeing in westworld season 2
19:33 which are just white beings that look
19:36 like maybe they were
19:37 dipped but they have more of an ecto
19:39 skeleton on the outside that is
19:41 sort of armor based i don't believe they
19:45 have any true
19:45 facial features but now what's
19:48 interesting about the whole thing
19:51 is that we have the schematics
19:55 of the human body we can make the human
19:58 body in all kinds of shapes and sizes
20:00 right
20:03 initially what is a human being i mean
20:05 the core
20:06 thing that is the human being would be
20:08 the bone structure
20:10 a brilliantly pre-designed pre-balanced
20:13 amazing thing obviously getting it to
20:16 balance and getting into
20:18 function is going to be our our
20:22 one of our milestones we're going to
20:23 figure out
20:25 we now have various plastics
20:29 and metals that can be put together
20:33 to react to electricity to function like
20:35 a muscle
20:37 you've probably seen if you're sort of a
20:40 youtuber
20:41 there are various metals that when
20:44 heated
20:44 and electrified little grasshoppers and
20:49 little
20:49 little fake you know frogs
20:53 they look like origami
20:56 you can take metals and forge them in
20:59 ways that their thickness varies and
21:00 when you heat them up they immediately
21:02 fold into a shape like a protein
21:05 very cool
21:09 so we would probably
21:13 not mess with the human skeleton meaning
21:16 we wouldn't redesign
21:17 any of the bones because if we redesign
21:21 a single bone
21:24 within the threshold of bone generation
21:25 in general right so we might take a six
21:27 foot five guy
21:28 in a five foot girl skeleton
21:32 and start to find where we have leeway
21:35 how big can we make a femur
21:36 how big do we make a pelvis and if we
21:40 make the pelvis that big
21:41 this is generally how big the upper
21:43 bones are
21:45 and there's going to be a huge key
21:46 helper in this whole thing which i'll
21:48 get to in a second
21:50 we know the muscle structure that goes
21:52 over the bones we know where cartilage
21:54 is
21:55 depending on what we're making this
21:56 thing out of cartilage
21:59 may or may not need to be as functional
22:02 as it as it is in the human body i mean
22:03 cartilage actually
22:06 wears away in your knees and your spine
22:08 [Music]
22:10 and your vertebrae so
22:13 what i'm talking about is the initial
22:15 step that would be the credits
22:16 of westwood figuring out a way
22:20 to at least build the human body we
22:22 don't have to worry about its
22:23 functionality just yet but we do want
22:25 muscle
22:26 groups and we do want a way to electrify
22:29 them
22:31 logically because we are going to have
22:33 to build an artificial nervous system
22:36 it's going to talk to every single
22:38 muscle group
22:40 we don't need blood we don't necessarily
22:42 need a heart
22:44 the way that the human body uses it we
22:47 would probably need a heart
22:48 to create a facsimile for perhaps a
22:51 doctor
22:51 putting a stethoscope up against your
22:54 chest and hearing the bump bump bump
22:57 or if you want to fall in love with
22:58 somebody and put your head on their
22:59 chest
23:00 hopefully they're emulating that they're
23:03 alive
23:04 warmth in the body would have to be
23:06 something we would have to simulate
23:09 but immediately if you're normal
23:12 you're going to think well dude the
23:14 thing that we can creates the brain
23:18 i mean kurzweil is up there in the
23:20 singularity project
23:22 just blowing smoke up everyone's holes
23:24 that he's gonna
23:25 create a computer brain and he's gonna
23:28 uh he literally believes he's gonna have
23:30 that complete
23:31 and and image his brain into a computer
23:36 interesting right but we have two
23:40 sort of secret weapons that can be
23:43 combined in my opinion
23:45 to sort through a tremendous amount of
23:48 the r
23:49 d relatively quickly
23:53 one of them is called big machine
23:54 learning
23:56 and the other one is called quantum
23:58 computing
23:59 and when combined depending on how
24:02 efficient
24:04 the programmers are
24:08 depending on how observant the
24:10 biologists are
24:12 and the neurologists because again we
24:16 don't have to create necessarily all the
24:19 complexities of the human body we just
24:21 have to create a facsimile
24:23 that's convincing
24:26 and let's put some parameters further
24:28 parameters on
24:30 uh the entire project general gen 1
24:34 was put that way now technically
24:37 speaking gen 1 would be
24:40 getting the being to come alive to some
24:44 definable degree
24:45 and let's just say it can't do anything
24:48 but
24:48 it's lying down on a table
24:52 and we've got the program
24:55 at the point where when we wake it up
24:58 it opens its eyes and it's registering
25:01 sight
25:02 and has microphones in the ear and we
25:05 could even construct something like the
25:06 hammer in the ear
25:08 and actually metabolize sound closer to
25:10 the way the humans do
25:11 it just depends but we would want that
25:15 being
25:16 to be able to speak
25:19 and again we could create
25:23 some sort of speaker in the throat
25:27 which would be some 1950s implementation
25:30 or it would always die like this or
25:34 we could labor to try and
25:37 recreate the vocal cord of the human
25:40 being
25:40 which sounds impossible right with our
25:43 current technology
25:45 but with big machine learning and
25:48 quantum computing
25:49 i think these insurmountable things
25:52 these unimaginable things
25:54 are now technically possible i'm not
25:56 saying it's easy
25:58 but what's interesting about those two
26:00 technologies being brought together
26:04 is that
26:07 we can have big machine learning observe
26:11 behaviors of all
26:14 definable behaviors and i mean if you
26:17 can
26:17 conceive of a pattern of behavior in any
26:20 way shape or form
26:22 big machine learning can be set up to
26:26 observe billions and billions
26:30 of examples and then as long as we know
26:34 how to
26:34 map what it's observing to an invention
26:39 that invention can be controlled by the
26:41 big machine learning programs
26:43 where by an artificial intelligence
26:46 writes the program for us when kurtzwell
26:50 started talking about you know imaging
26:51 his brain
26:52 into a computer and let me just
26:56 rewind for you so
26:59 i was on a movie project for three years
27:02 at least
27:04 solid man which was a film
27:07 that was stolen from us and became
27:09 johnny depp's transcendence movie
27:11 it's not johnny's fault okay
27:14 but it was about uploading your
27:16 consciousness into a computer
27:19 as well as i was sort of
27:22 under the covers for the tron legacy
27:26 project sadly i was not
27:29 allowed to get on the rewrite team
27:31 because that movie would have been a
27:32 help a lot better although casting is
27:34 what screwed it up but
27:36 yeah just to put a finer note on that
27:38 the guy that played zeus who's a great
27:40 comedic
27:41 british actor was sadly
27:44 horribly miscast and i think
27:48 that part of the movie when you go to
27:49 the nightclub and directly in the center
27:51 of the film
27:53 it just destroys the entire film and
27:55 tries to get back on track which it kind
27:57 of does
27:58 not that actor's fault he's an amazing
28:00 actor
28:01 he's now in that angel devil series with
28:04 david tennant doing a fantastic job
28:06 but if they really wanted to steal the
28:08 guy from the matrix
28:10 he was open for employment they should
28:12 have just hired that dude
28:13 but then it would have been a dead
28:15 rip-off of that guy because it would
28:17 have been the same actor so they
28:18 shouldn't have written such a character
28:19 but whatever
28:22 what i'm getting at is that in being
28:25 involved with these projects we sat
28:26 around
28:28 thinking about what it means to truly
28:32 capture the brain inside of a computer
28:34 now for those of you hardcore listeners
28:36 you know i believe in a soul
28:38 and not from some guilt trip uh god
28:41 complex i fear
28:42 the lord and jesus taking now my beliefs
28:46 are
28:46 one camp which involve
28:50 those characters and my technical belief
28:53 of how we come together is very
28:55 scientific
28:56 i think we have scientific proof that
29:00 well i should say by those of us who are
29:02 in pop science and we're not on
29:04 television and we're not stuck in
29:05 sitcoms and movies to popularize
29:07 ourselves
29:08 we have proof there's a spiritual realm
29:11 and spiritual realms don't exist without
29:13 souls they just don't and
29:14 so don't worry about religious
29:16 definitions of soul it's simply what we
29:18 call the organized energy that is your
29:20 true
29:20 indestructible consciousness your body
29:23 can die
29:24 infinitely and your soul never dies
29:28 you can't hide energy in the universe
29:32 so but let's just say for instance your
29:35 soul
29:36 has has taken advantage of the binary
29:39 system
29:40 of your neural net and at least at one
29:42 point in time there's
29:44 an instance of consciousness that
29:47 perhaps holds more than the soul has or
29:50 sorry as much as the soul has which i
29:52 doubt
29:54 but what i told my buddy who wrote this
29:57 film
29:58 i don't want to say his name so it
30:00 doesn't cause issues for him but
30:05 was that if we capture the brain it's
30:08 going to be
30:10 a mechanism by which we capture it by
30:13 design
30:14 without the complexity of actually
30:15 having to do the labor and i'll give you
30:17 an example that's more coarse
30:22 what if you wanted to create a mask of
30:25 a human being who's famous
30:29 while they're alive there's death masks
30:32 too
30:32 but you're not a sculptor but you want
30:35 to be known for creating these masks of
30:37 individuals there's all kinds of
30:38 hollywood special effects people from
30:40 the 80s who did this
30:41 in the 90s when our schwarzenegger was
30:44 in a
30:45 total recall back in the day several
30:47 masks of his face
30:49 were created what do you do you put that
30:52 plaster
30:54 all over their face that rubber plaster
30:57 actually put uh sorry you put plaster on
30:59 their face you put oil on their face you
31:01 put the plaster on you let it dry you
31:03 get a little air hole straws and that
31:04 kind of thing
31:05 tell them not to move and you have them
31:07 lean forward and it comes off
31:10 and there you've got the imprint of
31:12 their face every pore
31:14 mole eyelash eyebrow hairline it's all
31:17 inside the mask
31:19 now you just pour the rubber in there
31:21 and you've got at least
31:23 the casting of their face now
31:27 did you sculpt their face
31:30 no you did not you were able to use a
31:33 technology
31:34 that by design captured their face
31:38 so when i say capturing the brain by
31:40 design
31:41 it would have to be some really generic
31:45 iterative technology that could somehow
31:48 scan in 3d
31:49 the entire state of the human body
31:52 within a
31:52 nanosecond i would say would be a
31:54 comfortable increment of time
31:56 meaning instantaneously and therefore
31:59 the weather pattern of the entire body
32:02 is captured at once
32:03 you don't have to personally program all
32:06 the ones and zeroes
32:07 you don't have to do and we're going to
32:09 read this part and i'm going to read
32:10 that part and note
32:11 you cast the entire face at the same
32:13 time not the nose just once and then you
32:15 attach it to the ear
32:16 later on it's all at the same time
32:20 that is how i believe kurzweil
32:23 could capture the energy matrix
32:28 of the human body i just don't think we
32:30 have the technology to pull it off that
32:32 quickly
32:33 at least without probably killing the
32:35 human being but think about the
32:36 three-dimensional
32:38 mesh of the human body that's a lot of
32:40 data
32:41 all over the place just capturing the
32:44 brain
32:46 i don't think that quite gets it done
32:49 the big machine learning let's go for
32:51 the vocal cord
32:54 let's say we figure out how to
32:56 three-dimensionally capture
32:59 the movements of the vocal cord
33:04 to create the vowels and the consonants
33:06 that we use for any one particular
33:08 language
33:10 maybe it's cameras maybe it's some sort
33:13 of uh
33:15 ultrasound whatever captures the
33:18 three-dimensional shape and its
33:20 frequency of
33:21 morphing is obviously when you sing
33:24 i've seen a couple of videos that were
33:26 um x-ray machines where people are
33:27 singing you see their vocal cords
33:29 vibrate
33:30 extremely fast as long as this system
33:33 has a
33:34 iteration that is faster than the human
33:37 body moves
33:38 we will capture every single fold wiggle
33:41 mucus buildup dry area
33:47 and we'll be able to
33:50 model the vocal cord
33:53 then we put it through big machine
33:54 learning to start
33:56 averaging multiple vocal cords
34:00 through all the vowels through all the
34:01 consonants through any other
34:04 phonic that's coming out of the throat
34:06 you could do a guy beat boxing if you
34:08 wanted to
34:09 but you'd also have to track the lips
34:10 and the tongue all that data
34:13 right and you put it together such that
34:17 at least
34:18 the big machine learning algorithm goes
34:20 i know what you need to do with the
34:23 human
34:25 system to create a particular sound
34:29 now obviously the cavity inside of our
34:31 skull has to be replicated as well
34:33 for those of you who are sort of
34:36 either you are an anthropologist or you
34:38 are interested in such a thing
34:40 the evolution from hominid to
34:43 homo sapien where the missing link
34:47 is according to their definition of time
34:50 and carbon dating is supposedly 150
34:52 million years missing we have 32
34:56 different skulls before that point
34:58 and all the stuff after with hominid
35:00 right beside
35:02 man when homo sapien sapien showed up
35:05 the redesign of the skull from hominid
35:10 to homo sapien sapien is phenomenal
35:14 it's where we actually redesigned
35:18 the nasal cavity the brain cavity got
35:22 bigger
35:23 and suddenly we could speak
35:27 we could we didn't have to howl anymore
35:30 so when it comes to the theories of
35:32 being dropped off by aliens
35:34 or spliced with indigenous hominids to
35:37 create man based on some other genetic
35:40 there's a tremendous amount of evidence
35:43 to suggest
35:44 that that's what took place
35:47 so now let's take every other metric of
35:49 human behavior
35:52 and run it through the same process
35:56 starting with the most simple of simple
35:58 things
35:59 now again we would have to come up with
36:02 an imaging system
36:03 of electricity in every
36:06 every single faceted human body
36:09 let's just say we wanted to track what
36:12 it was like to lay down in a relaxed
36:14 form meaning we're not using our body
36:17 laying down is different than sitting
36:18 straight up right you're still using
36:19 muscle groups when you
36:20 sit straight up now technically when
36:23 you're conscious
36:24 conscious you're using muscle groups as
36:26 well which is why when they
36:28 hypnotize you and they say relax right
36:31 relax sink into your bed just figure
36:33 yourself falling into the mattress
36:36 you do you realize you're using a bunch
36:38 of muscles even though you're lying in
36:39 your bed
36:42 so let's just say they get some pretty
36:43 trained people to relax but you want to
36:45 track
36:46 the brain telling the finger to move up
36:48 and down
36:50 that sounds pretty trivial but there's a
36:53 ton of stuff going on
36:54 you know there's a certain part of the
36:56 brain the left side
36:58 sort of centers where my finger is
37:00 working on the right side
37:03 and so they map this human being
37:07 with special technology to be able to
37:10 three-dimensionally track
37:12 the transmission of data from conscious
37:15 thought to the finger
37:18 okay that would be like a one
37:22 one-off experiment to test whether or
37:24 not the technology is actually working
37:28 probably very crude at first
37:32 now how many of you know what motion
37:34 capture is
37:36 motion capture is the process of
37:39 putting a human being inside a motion
37:41 capture suit
37:42 or motion capture system they're
37:44 extremely cool nowadays and
37:47 very uninvasive
37:50 and you move around and there's wires in
37:53 some of the cases there's little dots
37:55 and the other cases you've been observed
37:56 and there's a new one now that you can
37:58 actually wear like a pager
37:59 and you just have some wires on your
38:01 body and i think it tracks like 11 hours
38:04 inside this little tiny box and you
38:05 bring it to your computer
38:07 and it tells you where all your fingers
38:09 were your arms your toes
38:12 uh probably doesn't track your actual
38:13 face which is why in
38:16 weta when they did the planet of the
38:18 apes remakes
38:19 they you know pulled this off course
38:21 avatar used it as well a bunch of things
38:23 benjamin button but now imagine
38:28 did you take the principle of motion
38:30 capture
38:31 and you build a full ecto
38:34 suit and maybe even a facial mask
38:38 of some sort it could be you're actually
38:41 wearing a camera as well like a headgear
38:43 or it's actually filming your face
38:45 with little dots suggesting where things
38:47 are even though dots are a little
38:48 primitive nowadays
38:50 because they can flat out know where
38:51 your where your mouth is i mean look at
38:53 all these cell phone apps that could
38:54 turn you into a bunny
38:56 it's tremendous
39:00 you build one that is tracking all the
39:02 movement of the body
39:04 but as an additional layer to it it's
39:07 tracking tracking
39:08 all of the electricity and it might
39:12 actually end up
39:13 triangulating electricity
39:16 what do i mean by that
39:19 let's say you know and the nervous
39:21 system is moving at a
39:22 massive pace right the computers can
39:25 move faster
39:28 or as fast as imagine imagine
39:32 imagine a new word imagine
39:37 you've got some electricity going down
39:38 your forearm to the finger
39:40 but it's embedded in some flesh
39:43 but you've got sensors all over the body
39:46 in this
39:47 incredibly detailed matrix this meaning
39:50 it's like the pixels on your telephone
39:53 are way more dense than the pixels on
39:54 your tv
39:56 something to that degree
39:59 a sub millimeter
40:05 sub micron density
40:08 and what it's hap what's happening is as
40:10 electricity moves through your muscle
40:12 tissues
40:13 these very sensitive um
40:16 milliamp little sensors are sensing the
40:19 electricity
40:21 one of them gets a little stronger but
40:22 since it's going through muscle tissue
40:24 and it's electrifying everything in all
40:26 directions
40:27 even perhaps a minuscule magnetic
40:30 pull is going around this little message
40:33 coming from your brain
40:35 it's almost like a hadron collider using
40:38 a sigma 5 algorithm
40:40 you can figure out where your
40:42 electricity is in your flesh
40:45 connect that to big machine learning
40:48 connect it i mean the suit might look
40:50 absolutely ridiculous it might be
40:52 that the suit might weigh a thousand
40:53 pounds it's on a harness and you're just
40:55 moving around the room while you're
40:57 educating the big machine learning
41:00 again basic functions first complex
41:03 functions later like dancing
41:06 maybe throwing a baseball whatever
41:09 but it is tracking and recording the
41:12 front
41:12 twos of these muscle groups that you're
41:14 replicating on your
41:16 replicant skeleton
41:21 it's not only saving how the messages
41:24 transfer from the brain to the muscles
41:26 but it's transferring it's saving
41:30 all of the other ancillary things that
41:32 are going on
41:34 standing up and are my example that i
41:37 didn't finish
41:38 the being is laying down it wakes up
41:41 perhaps at that point you just have a
41:42 conversation with it which was
41:44 dramatized in westworld you want to hear
41:47 it talk back
41:49 because you've mastered vocal chord
41:50 movement tongue movement
41:53 which would be just phenomenal you could
41:54 have different groups right
41:56 one group's working on the head working
41:58 on linguistics
42:00 the other groups working on sight
42:02 eyeball movements
42:03 it's all being tracked right others are
42:06 just working on
42:08 walking laying down getting up core body
42:11 movements
42:13 by triangulating the electricity we can
42:15 figure out what muscle groups are
42:16 actually getting the message
42:18 as long as we use human anatomy to
42:20 figure this out again
42:22 if we divert away from human anatomy
42:25 then we are resetting the complexity
42:28 of the game and that's something we can
42:30 do in a future generation
42:32 as we can use big machine learning to
42:35 suggest
42:36 you know what you could combine these
42:37 two muscle groups and get the same job
42:40 done
42:40 i figured it out
42:44 but if you want that being to get up and
42:46 lean up in the
42:48 table swing itself around so it drops
42:51 this legs over the edge of the table
42:53 it's got its palms on the edge of the
42:55 table it's going to do all the leaning
42:57 and moving and tilting
42:59 put those feet on the ground and stay
43:01 balanced
43:04 it's a super complex thing but to big
43:07 machine learning
43:09 it's uh at least playback wouldn't be
43:13 that intense now of course there's
43:14 anomalies if you captured
43:16 the movements of perhaps a 5 foot 10
43:19 male
43:20 it's probably a good idea that we would
43:22 make a 5 foot 10 skeleton
43:25 with all the muscle groups on it so that
43:28 we don't
43:29 um get things off equilibrium wise right
43:34 but that's why we want to track as many
43:36 multiple as many body types as possible
43:39 so the big machine learning can figure
43:41 out all the differential algorithms
43:43 for how to move the body
43:46 based on its size maybe we discover
43:50 it's one set of neural messages
43:53 works for any body type i suspect it's
43:55 probably very close to that
43:59 but i think that a six foot eight
44:01 basketball player
44:04 who has a longer distance to
44:07 have his brain talk to his feet and now
44:09 it's really really quick but we're
44:11 talking about nanoseconds so
44:13 you can slow down time i mean sorry so
44:15 you can slow down light with a
44:16 nanosecond man
44:19 it's going to be a longer message to
44:20 wiggle his toe
44:23 than a five-foot woman wiggly her toe
44:26 so we need to know these things
44:31 we can only rely on well with eric
44:34 dollard's help we could actually create
44:35 longitudinal circuits
44:37 and we could achieve faster than light
44:40 travel
44:41 to and from these organs can you imagine
44:43 that a being that is
44:46 got a neural system 11 times the speed
44:49 of light
44:51 i believe his little uh
44:54 laboratory in his basement was called um
44:59 borderland or something like that camera
45:02 exactly was about four or five guys
45:04 working in a basement filming this thing
45:07 but where does quantum computing come in
45:09 because i said quantum computing would
45:11 be a
45:11 huge part of this well big machine
45:14 learning
45:15 consumes a tremendous amount of
45:17 processing power
45:18 and we have a mount everest amount
45:22 of data to mulch
45:25 constantly to come to any bearable
45:28 usable conclusions
45:32 what are we told about quantum computers
45:34 today
45:36 i have a whole episode on quantum
45:37 computers if you don't know what one is
45:39 i explain it to you
45:40 with illustrations and all kinds of
45:42 stuff so definitely get over there and
45:43 take a look
45:44 just go to deepthoughtsradio.com switch
45:48 search on quantum if you know how to
45:49 spell it or computers if you don't know
45:51 a small quantum
45:53 but it uses the rotational
45:57 frequency of atoms to
46:00 guess solutions to problems
46:04 so as an atom rolls around several times
46:08 in a second
46:09 they're using that as a
46:13 as a projector into equations to quickly
46:17 come up with
46:17 the equation that the solution that
46:20 actually works through the equation
46:22 and if the equation has many solutions
46:25 then it will find all of them
46:26 as fast as possible
46:30 again i believe the analogy was that
46:33 once they stabilize 300 cubits
46:36 they will be able to have a computer
46:38 here on earth
46:40 that can conceive of every single grain
46:42 of sand on every planet
46:45 in the universe including all of the
46:47 star dust
46:48 that's floating around and whether or
46:50 not they get down to ether particle
46:51 counts
46:52 not sure if we have to go to a thousand
46:54 cubits once they can stabilize
46:56 50 to 100 accuracy
47:00 then it's no problem adding another
47:02 thousand
47:04 and that would be a number of
47:08 you know one to the power of two a
47:11 thousand times
47:13 it's a horrendously large number okay
47:17 so in order to get these big machine
47:19 learning algorithms to figure out the
47:21 human body
47:22 within our lifetime these quantum
47:25 computers
47:27 could be very useful now currently
47:28 quantum computers are
47:30 about a five to one percent error rate
47:34 meaning they i guess um they i couldn't
47:38 find the
47:39 a decent definition of what they
47:40 actually considered to be an error
47:43 but it would be probably losing track of
47:46 one of the atoms
47:47 that they're using to
47:50 create a qubit and there's several
47:52 different elements in the periodic table
47:55 that are very instrumental i think
47:58 sulfur was one of them but watch the
48:01 episode because i quote a few that are
48:03 in there
48:05 they have to be stable enough to isolate
48:09 and through electricity they can
48:10 actually freeze them
48:12 in a particular polarity meaning instead
48:14 of rotating constantly they can heal it
48:16 with a little bit of electricity and it
48:17 all stabilizes
48:21 but imagine that
48:25 probably even 50 stable qubits solves
48:28 our problem quite a bit
48:31 now what's interesting about it is that
48:32 most of us who look at darpa
48:35 boston dynamics uh robots
48:39 i always like to say darpa so you know
48:40 where it originated from
48:43 google funded them for a little while
48:45 and then pulled that because i think it
48:46 looked pretty suspect
48:49 is that we know that the they have the
48:51 dog
48:52 they have the mule which looks like a
48:55 cow
48:56 and they have the couple levels of
48:59 humans
49:00 one is humanoid thin and one's humanoid
49:03 big
49:04 right now they're pretty intense right
49:07 but every time you see them
49:10 uh initially they had the wire hanging
49:12 from the ceiling
49:13 like a tether to a vr goggles
49:17 for all kinds of different reasons they
49:18 didn't have to put the computer on board
49:20 meaning if it's falls over rolls down
49:22 the computer circuitry doesn't take the
49:24 impact
49:26 but two the big one was the power supply
49:29 running all those little servo servos
49:31 and
49:32 hydraulics and whatever they're using to
49:34 do what they're doing
49:35 takes a tremendous amount of power just
49:37 eat it up really quickly
49:41 now okay so you put that off to the side
49:44 that's what robots
49:46 have as a major limitation
49:49 okay well do you and i have a power
49:53 plant inside of us
49:54 i mean are we iron men do we have a
49:56 little little nuclear reactor a little
49:59 zero point energy system in our chest
50:01 nah i don't think i have a battery in me
50:04 anywhere
50:05 i mean i got scanned from my crotch to
50:07 the top of my head
50:08 it wasn't a duracell in there somewhere
50:11 so isn't it interesting
50:13 we have this amazing system that can
50:15 consume food
50:17 and water and we create
50:20 enough energy just like the matrix movie
50:22 alluded to
50:24 it was on point about where all bunch of
50:26 batteries inside this matrix computer
50:28 i can't imagine that was real and we can
50:32 do all kinds of stuff
50:33 i mean look at the entire world man
50:37 you look around in a big city man did
50:40 all that
50:41 and built the roads man built the
50:42 buildings you can't even see vegetation
50:45 in nice right
50:46 it's the it's the concrete city of the
50:48 universe
50:50 eiffel tower big giant buildings in
50:53 dubai and singapore
50:57 that didn't require any hardcore tesla
51:00 battery inside of us
51:02 so we got something going for us in this
51:04 food metabolation system
51:07 talk about ingenious but unfortunately
51:11 unless we can create a system to break
51:15 down
51:15 food and steal its
51:18 sugar calorie system and its fat calorie
51:21 system
51:22 and burn that in a way that can create
51:24 electricity
51:26 we're going to have to have a power
51:28 system inside of us
51:31 depending on the use of the robot well
51:33 you know
51:34 it would set off metal detectors unless
51:37 we can find a way to insulate it
51:42 we don't have to use metals at all we
51:43 could use ceramics
51:46 so someone's going to have to in the
51:48 team
51:49 create the power source for all this but
51:51 for now we don't care about it at first
51:53 we'll supply through a cable to the
51:57 outlet in the wall the power necessary
52:00 to make this happen
52:02 but now here's what's interesting about
52:04 human biology
52:06 and i wish i still have my microbiology
52:09 buddy
52:10 and my friend circle because i would
52:12 probably have thrown this by him
52:13 initially
52:16 what do we know about where
52:19 the energy is stored within the human
52:22 body
52:25 what organs obviously use
52:28 electricity quite a bit but what organs
52:32 are mainly distribution centers of
52:34 electricity and which organs are more
52:36 the receptors of electricity
52:40 i would have to guess that the brain is
52:42 the distribution center
52:45 but you know the heart's pumping
52:46 constantly your autonomic system of your
52:49 body's moving blood
52:51 your arteries actually undulate like
52:54 worms they move things through that's
52:57 why
52:59 a little footnote here there was a point
53:02 in my life when i
53:03 actually first started smoking cigars as
53:05 an adult
53:06 i just went over this guy's smoke lounge
53:08 and he actually has his own
53:09 line of cigars and i was trying to help
53:11 him sell them
53:13 but he was also being solicited because
53:15 this happens to smoke shops investors
53:17 always come into smoke shops looking for
53:18 rich people
53:20 and they try to tap him because they
53:22 were going to be making their own energy
53:23 drink
53:24 which was more like a like a chocolate
53:27 kind of drink i had some it was pretty
53:29 delicious
53:31 and i saw i sat down with them i said so
53:33 what makes your you know energy drink
53:35 better than somebody else's
53:37 i said well ours doesn't have any that
53:39 crap that's in monster
53:40 and uh red bull i don't know anything
53:44 about it at the time so i'm like
53:45 okay well lay it on me man what's the
53:47 problem you guys well
53:50 the active ingredient in both those
53:51 drink systems
53:53 and all their spin-off coffees and all
53:55 that stuff hardens your arteries
53:57 and that's why all these kids are dying
53:59 after a football game in high school
54:01 you pound these things so if you drink a
54:04 lot of energy drinks
54:06 you're hardening your arteries when you
54:07 harden your arteries they don't do this
54:09 thing they don't
54:10 undulate and keep the plaque off the
54:13 inside of your arteries so if you eat
54:15 crappy food
54:15 cholesterol and a bunch of other stuff
54:17 you'll get plaque
54:19 near your heart and those big fat
54:21 arteries keep your system pumping
54:24 and then at a particular time let's say
54:27 you got off the drinks
54:29 and now it starts to free up those those
54:31 little plaque clusters
54:33 and it moves into your heart and it can
54:36 kill you in a split second in your heart
54:38 attack in a split second
54:40 anyone with family members they got an
54:42 open heart surgery both my uncle my dad
54:44 got it
54:45 because i got my dad's heart uh my dad's
54:47 family's heart i have my mom's family's
54:49 heart that god
54:51 it's a it's a congenital thing it's just
54:54 they shouldn't be messing around amyloid
54:57 plaque clusters in your brain causes
54:59 alzheimer's
55:00 jeez we've had to do something with the
55:02 drinks and that's just what happens in
55:04 the brain
55:05 so our little robot you know if
55:08 he or she ate something we'd want to
55:10 just hold it in a container
55:12 maybe uh pulverize it using electricity
55:16 or some onboard chemical
55:18 and then they waste it out on a toilet
55:21 just like everybody else
55:22 they pee the water out the front let go
55:25 the other stuff out the back and so they
55:28 can simulate
55:30 the need to go the restroom now whether
55:33 or not
55:34 we have technology to metabolize the
55:37 energy out of
55:38 food is beyond my knowledge
55:42 i meaning i don't think that i've ever
55:44 read an article that claims such a thing
55:45 for a mechanical object
55:48 that would be nice wouldn't it but
55:51 what's interesting is
55:52 again our system
55:56 our body is using milliamps all over the
55:59 place to accomplish everything that we
56:01 accomplish all day long
56:03 it's a phenomenal system so i think the
56:06 charter of our little
56:08 project my massive project
56:11 would be able to attempt to create
56:15 a muscle group system that reacts to
56:17 that
56:18 minuscule amount of energy such that
56:22 if we did have to charge up our little
56:25 robot here to go out in the public and
56:26 mess with people
56:30 it would be a very generously small
56:33 system
56:34 operating on the same parameters of a
56:37 human being
56:39 but now let's jump into westworld season
56:42 one a little bit
56:43 episode one again if you haven't seen
56:48 at least the first season of westworld
56:51 you've robbed yourself
56:53 and you have a present waiting for you
56:55 if you like good science fiction
56:57 and i mean fiction meaning this stuff
57:00 has
57:01 sort of the principles of being possible
57:03 as opposed to science fantasy
57:05 sci-fi right star wars is sci-fi
57:08 blade runner science fiction
57:11 was science fiction
57:14 they had these behaviors which i
57:17 apologize the name escapes me they used
57:19 to be in the script
57:21 but it were these these little nuances
57:23 that they started to notice
57:25 when they would bring one of what they
57:27 called a host which is what they call
57:29 the robots
57:30 they were hosting the humans the guests
57:33 was what they called the humans
57:37 and they brought one in for maintenance
57:39 one of the prostitutes from the brothel
57:43 and she was sitting there by herself and
57:45 she's sort of in program mode which
57:46 means she does she's not talking and
57:48 being herself
57:49 you know narrating her character
57:53 and she went up and touched her lips
57:55 like this and she just pulls out
57:56 she's like oh my gosh like she's doing
57:58 something and the qa person's like what
58:00 is that
58:01 and he said oh that's the new thing that
58:03 ford put in there the guy designed these
58:05 things he put in these new things
58:06 he's a little vignettes of behavior that
58:09 they create themselves as a result of
58:11 being alive in that world
58:14 we do it all the time so
58:18 the there's the old um
58:24 story about the diamond versus the
58:26 kubrick zirconium
58:29 howdy can you tell the difference well
58:32 when you pull up
58:33 one of these rocks up to your magnifying
58:36 eyeball thing
58:38 a diamond has imperfections the cubic
58:41 zirconia
58:42 is perfect that's how you know it's fake
58:46 so part of our big machine learning
58:49 would be
58:50 after we master the basic functionality
58:53 of
58:54 our robot our replicant
58:58 we then have to layer on top of basic
59:00 functionality
59:02 the nuances of man
59:06 where do we have differences between us
59:10 because you know movie stars
59:14 how do we impersonate movie stars
59:18 well you know jack nicholson has those
59:20 crazy eyebrows and he's got that thing
59:22 you know
59:24 wendy give me the bed you know all the
59:27 impersonations you've ever seen george
59:29 bush impersonations donald trump
59:30 impersonations
59:33 they have things about them that make
59:35 them unique
59:38 sometimes people have physical tics
59:40 those are other things
59:42 we generally consider a tick a general
59:44 imperfection behavior could be
59:46 neurological it could be
59:49 psychological so we have to consider
59:54 at some point every nuance that we want
59:57 to address
59:59 and once we identify a nuance that we
60:02 want to address
60:02 we need to take the big machine machine
60:04 learning system that we've hooked up
60:07 and capture the behavior of as many
60:10 people as possible
60:12 now what's interesting going back to the
60:14 mocap
60:16 is that i'm i'm a blender artist okay in
60:19 3d right
60:21 mo camping has refined itself
60:25 tremendously
60:26 there's a brand new mocapping service
60:28 and the name escapes me at the moment
60:31 but what you can do is put yourself in
60:33 front of a green screen
60:35 or a single colored wall where you're
60:37 not wearing that color
60:39 and you can in fact you're supposed to
60:42 be able to upload like
60:44 videos of people playing basketball on a
60:46 court even that
60:49 and this system understands what is
60:51 moving and what is not moving and it
60:52 understands the human form
60:54 so well that it will send you back the
60:57 mocap
60:58 of all the human beings in that scene
61:01 including their depth
61:02 of field like or how far they are away
61:05 from the camera
61:07 and it captures all basic movements now
61:08 again it's not really capturing the face
61:10 yet
61:11 that i know of but that's an amazing
61:13 step up
61:15 so say you've got this crackpot team
61:18 that knows everything and when you meet
61:20 a true
61:23 uh i don't even know what you call them
61:25 geek is not
61:26 good enough like a true whiz kid
61:29 in a particular technology
61:33 they blow your mind man they'll go oh
61:36 well
61:36 you know what are you working on them in
61:37 and they'll be like oh i'm working on
61:40 this and they click a button
61:41 and something mind-blowing happens on
61:43 the screen you're like
61:44 what right those people exist
61:48 and they know how to harvest them
61:50 through mensa
61:52 through prometheus through caltech
61:56 mit oxford cambridge
61:59 all these places they know how to find
62:01 them they test well in school
62:03 that gets percolated up into a database
62:06 any kid that graduates high school at 12
62:09 as a candidate especially if they're in
62:11 his computer sciences
62:13 or robotics or both or electronics
62:17 so imagine this in addition to all of
62:20 our laboratory experiments to map the
62:22 human body which is a very specific
62:25 invasive operation forevers
62:29 guinea pig in themselves into the system
62:32 we can actually have a computer at some
62:34 point in the future on a separate team
62:37 once we figure out the touch points that
62:40 we want to
62:40 put into the big machine learning i'll
62:42 give you an example that just in case
62:44 that doesn't make sense to you
62:46 if you wanted to say figure out
62:50 the average range of a forearm
62:54 you could videotape a forearm and every
62:56 single conceivable maneuver that's going
62:57 to happen and what you're telling the
62:59 big machine learning is
63:00 this is the elbow this is the wrist is
63:02 where all the bones are
63:03 [Music]
63:05 on that's what you know about the these
63:07 parts of the body
63:08 the two bones in your forearm and how
63:10 they can actuate and turn
63:11 all the little phalanges and all the
63:13 little pieces
63:16 and then you tell the computer to just
63:18 watch and learn
63:20 what is possible is what is happening
63:21 what is not as possible as what is not
63:23 happening
63:24 so you get a positive and a negative now
63:28 what could actually take place
63:31 as it's putting all this together and
63:33 then with that fuzzy logic thing from
63:36 westworld you can say well you're more
63:37 than welcome to
63:39 try out different moves but you're not
63:41 to stress
63:43 the muscle tissue too much meaning
63:45 you're not allowed to break your own arm
63:48 and i think that it would be interesting
63:49 because we could definitely build bones
63:51 that would be
63:52 almost impossible to break you know if
63:54 you're trying to open up one of those
63:55 plastic envelopes you get mail in these
63:59 days
63:59 i mean it's hard to open them right the
64:01 old fedex bag which is now everywhere
64:03 just that synthetic plastic it's amazing
64:06 imagine making a bone out of stuff
64:09 i hope it goes without saying that this
64:11 being
64:14 would be extremely formidable like a
64:16 replicant
64:17 could beat the crap out of you you could
64:18 lift more than you can lift
64:20 can handle all kinds of things right
64:23 but you could have an ai watch
64:27 every single movie that has ever been
64:29 captured by man
64:31 they say learn what you can and if it
64:35 has a movie scene that's tough for the
64:37 computer to figure out your engineers
64:39 technically speaking
64:40 go into the software watch the scene
64:44 watch the big machine machine learning
64:46 metrics which is all the points that
64:48 it's going to be tracking
64:50 and upgrade the software and just oh oh
64:54 i get it yeah because you know that guy
64:55 walked by the other guy that confused
64:57 the system
64:58 so let's upgrade that system to keep
64:59 these two people apart
65:01 when they walk by each other even if
65:03 they have a lovemaking session
65:05 it doesn't lose track of whose legs or
65:07 who and whose body is who and all that
65:09 kind of stuff right
65:10 but all i've been talking about so far
65:14 is the base functionality of this being
65:17 within the project what is technically
65:20 possible
65:21 we're just executing raw commands to
65:24 give it the human capability of
65:26 movement of eyesight ear hearing
65:30 verbal communication perhaps a technique
65:33 to ingest food and excrete it
65:37 as a footnote to the epidermis
65:40 i heard this story from a good friend of
65:42 mine i think it was a sales guy
65:44 and a software company of mine
65:47 and he was in an elevator ride with
65:49 somebody somewhere in san francisco
65:52 i believe is where the story originated
65:55 in the 90s
65:57 and the story goes is that he was an
66:01 elevator ride with the old friend of his
66:02 it just was a coincidental thing and he
66:04 met his buddy and he was like
66:06 dude where you been man and it's great
66:08 what are you working on these days
66:10 and here's how you said the story he had
66:13 this satchel with him
66:15 and he opens up the satchel and he says
66:16 well i'll show you
66:18 and he pulls out this material
66:21 and hands it to my buddy and my buddy
66:24 grabs it with his hand and was
66:26 immediately freaked out
66:29 this was a like a like a quarter inch
66:32 thick
66:33 material that was artificial skin
66:38 and he said man he goes i freaked out
66:42 because
66:42 it felt so much like human skin it was
66:45 ridiculous
66:47 and he goes yeah man we got this
66:50 technology that can make skin
66:52 and it can be made biologically
66:53 compatible to human being
66:55 and we can grow this stuff now you know
66:57 more skin grafts and that kind of stuff
66:59 this was a long time ago man
67:02 never heard of this technology getting
67:03 out into the market
67:05 still hear about people getting injured
67:07 and having to do skin grafts which is
67:08 just a
67:09 horrific experience so in terms of
67:13 making the outside
67:14 human body appear real
67:17 now but i don't know about that
67:19 technology is can you make arm hair
67:22 head hair eyebrows can you make it grow
67:26 whiskers don't know
67:28 don't know at all with 3d printing
67:34 3d printing is there's two halves of 3d
67:37 printing and i watched a bunch of
67:39 tutorials and 3d printing was
67:41 starting to be rumored to exist
67:45 i don't know if this material can be uh
67:47 sorry these videos can be watched today
67:49 the very first one i watched was a total
67:52 geek
67:54 who had done some 3d modeling and he was
67:56 showing you how they can 3d print
67:58 molecules uh down to
68:03 you know i mean we know we've got all
68:05 different materials out there that's not
68:07 a big surprise but they were
68:08 essentially able to stack atoms together
68:11 to be whatever the hell they wanted
68:13 so can you imagine we're at the super
68:15 advanced level of the literally the
68:17 precipice of mankind's engineering in
68:19 our project
68:20 imagine taking human flesh with
68:24 hair follicles in it and literally
68:25 printing that stuff
68:27 where it's supposed to be literally the
68:29 direction the hair should grow
68:31 whether that follow the hair follicle is
68:33 going to be a whisper hair versus
68:36 the hair on your head or in your arm
68:39 or other places now obviously it goes
68:42 without saying there's got to be a
68:43 technology to attach the epidermis to
68:45 all these muscle groups
68:48 but i haven't gotten into personality
68:52 the actual true emulation
68:56 of the human condition
68:59 well this is the bane of all ai
69:02 programmers
69:05 but let's go back to our analogy with
69:07 molding the face
69:09 by design we get it accomplished by
69:12 mirroring
69:13 by design we don't sculpt a face
69:16 we put plaster paris on the face pull it
69:19 off and then put our artificial skin
69:22 inside the mold the skin takes the shape
69:25 of the molt no one was michelangelo
69:30 sculpting that thing out we simply
69:32 copied it
69:35 this gets to also the um
69:39 was it the jeff goldblum character in
69:40 jurassic park where he's warning them
69:42 he's like dude
69:44 you know just because you resurrected a
69:46 dinosaur doesn't mean you
69:48 understand what the hell you just did
69:50 and of course you made this really
69:51 insane
69:52 correlation with chaos theory
69:55 i guess at a real macro level everything
69:58 in the universe
69:59 folds into chaos theory so the human
70:02 condition
70:04 is obviously defined infinitely
70:08 by all the emotions that we can have
70:13 we have you know what we consider to be
70:17 the intangibles
70:19 anger sadness happiness
70:22 love being inquisitive
70:26 being indignant being entitled
70:30 that's when it's ample supply
70:33 being sympathetic being empathetic
70:37 processing environmental change
70:41 you're really hot right now you're
70:43 really cold right now
70:45 you're just perfect so
70:49 in that particular case and this has
70:52 been a long
70:53 um pronounced theory in artificial
70:56 intelligence
70:57 engineering which is when you take
71:00 a um sort of a turing test disciple
71:05 programmer in ai and you're trying to
71:08 create
71:09 some sort of like text-based application
71:11 the first turning test was
71:13 there was a wall in a room human beings
71:16 on one side
71:17 some human beings on the other side but
71:19 some of those uh inputs
71:21 and responses were coming back from a
71:23 program
71:25 the old program back in the 70s was
71:27 called lucy it was pretty good it was
71:29 pretty amazing
71:30 but if you could fool a human being on
71:32 the other side of the wall that it was
71:34 talking to a human being on the other
71:35 side of the wall
71:36 but it was actually an ai when you pass
71:39 the turn test
71:41 brilliant the story of turing is
71:44 actually
71:45 such a sombering tale and
71:49 you're surely thanks the project enigma
71:51 was a complete
71:53 propaganda piece which is why there's no
71:55 evidence that it ever
71:56 happened and there's no sense in
71:58 destroying his machine that cracked
72:00 project enigmas is the biggest telltale
72:03 sign the whole thing is a hoax
72:04 you would never destroy that machine you
72:07 would put it in the british museum
72:09 and say look how smart british people
72:11 are one of our dudes created this
72:13 and then we threatened him with chemical
72:15 castration because he was a homosexual
72:17 and he meant
72:17 he eventually took his own life if that
72:20 guy had done project enigma
72:23 he would not have been forced by the
72:24 courts to be castrated chemically
72:27 uh winston churchill would have signed a
72:30 the queen herself would have signed a
72:32 pardon for that guy
72:34 and uh the fact that he killed himself
72:35 as proof again that project enigma's
72:38 just a um comfort patch movie that was
72:41 fun to watch
72:44 but we would need a way
72:47 i think it was called reveries or
72:48 something like that westworld
72:51 it's gonna bother me until i look it up
72:55 but we would need a way to capture
72:59 these emotions
73:03 well what is an emotion the intangible
73:07 emotions let's just use love for a split
73:09 second
73:12 now the unfortunate thing is that babies
73:15 are born without the ability to
73:17 communicate
73:18 in any complex manner
73:21 now you ask a mother or a father we
73:23 definitely can look into their eyes and
73:25 their souls are
73:26 reading our souls and there's a
73:28 definitely a line of communication there
73:31 but if we really wanted to get down to
73:32 the nitty-gritty of what some of these
73:34 emotions require
73:36 then we have a
73:40 quantifiable pocket of time
73:44 in my opinion that is required to
73:46 incubate up
73:48 the concept of love hate sadness
73:51 whatever when you feel sympathetic
73:54 towards someone
73:57 you have to understand their situation
73:59 which means you have to live your life
74:01 to understand where they've got
74:03 themselves in their life such that you
74:05 would
74:06 give them some sympathy
74:09 now empathy is super complex compared to
74:12 sympathy
74:13 which is that you are vicariously
74:15 feeling their emotions
74:17 because again you've had similar
74:19 experiences in your life
74:21 you understand pain and suffering
74:23 therefore when you see
74:25 indicators the pain and suffering in
74:27 their expressions
74:29 you draw back on your own experience in
74:32 order to have it
74:34 so some of this emulation of human being
74:38 or human behavior excuse me requires a
74:40 past
74:43 introducing philip k
74:46 dick who understood this which is why in
74:50 his book uh
74:51 derandor's dream of electric sheep and
74:54 his contribution to
74:57 the memory track theories i think earl
74:59 hammer was the guy that actually did the
75:01 memory check episode in twilight zone
75:06 i could be wrong on that one but the
75:08 idea was
75:10 that if you're going to birth a robot at
75:13 a mature
75:13 age let's just say 35 years old 30 years
75:17 old somewhere in there
75:19 you want your robot to to exude
75:23 a physical appearance of the level of
75:26 sophistication they should be
75:28 at so if you were to make an
75:30 eight-year-old android
75:32 well then you could start with
75:35 uh less programming less memories
75:39 within that being because they could be
75:43 more naive
75:44 but if you're gonna birth someone who's
75:46 55 years old
75:48 give them a backstory that they were
75:49 some you know
75:52 mogul or a mother that's had four kids
75:55 and all that wear and tear of those
75:57 lives has to be pre-programmed into that
75:59 person
76:00 so that we believe the illusion
76:03 now the other technique would be to say
76:07 you want to um emulate say
76:10 for strategic reasons a politician
76:15 who's got power because you're going to
76:17 pull a scam on the people
76:19 then you would have to pick your
76:20 politician your sports figure
76:23 whatever and program
76:26 into that ai all of their attributes
76:31 now it just got way more difficult for
76:34 the team
76:36 who owns that particular part of the
76:37 game
76:40 can big machine learning help
76:46 it could help to the degree that we
76:49 could capture
76:51 the overall moments that contributed to
76:56 this ai and as i was about to mention
76:59 before
77:01 programmers have all come to the
77:03 conclusion after trying to create the
77:05 turing test
77:06 that to get it any more complex than a
77:08 turing test
77:10 which today is not hard to pass
77:13 you have to have a body
77:18 everyone comes to the conclusion when i
77:19 was in high school and getting into ai
77:22 on my own on the side which i was trying
77:25 to program
77:27 a system that could read all the
77:28 articles that i could feed it
77:31 and through big machine learning it
77:33 wasn't called that back then
77:35 it could predict what word should be
77:37 spoken after the word it just spoke
77:41 in order to retrieve information from a
77:44 human
77:44 or to perhaps regurgitate
77:48 something it had already learned
77:52 i just didn't have the computer power to
77:54 pull it off but
77:57 you realize in order to make a true
77:59 human you have to have the eyes and the
78:00 ears
78:01 you have to have all the senses of the
78:03 human body
78:04 at a minimum to take in
78:08 a histogram meaning data over time
78:12 to be able to come up with combinations
78:15 that would turn into something that
78:16 would emulate human behavior on a
78:19 psychological level
78:21 now one of the interesting ways that
78:23 this could be done
78:27 and this is a this would be
78:30 probably a 20 to 30-year experiment
78:34 would be to create an apparatus
78:39 that could be easily worn on the body
78:41 nothing too
78:42 invasive but be put on a human being
78:47 at the earliest age possible and it
78:50 would track
78:51 every single thing that the human being
78:53 experienced
78:55 they would have cameras somewhere near
78:57 the eye
78:58 microphones somewhere near both ears you
79:00 have to track both ears separately
79:02 in case they hear an explosion over here
79:04 it's much louder than it is in this side
79:06 of the ear
79:07 or chronologically it went you know
79:09 right left
79:10 and the sudden look suddenly look right
79:13 you would need to know that in order to
79:14 emulate it later on
79:19 and then we would take all the data
79:21 being processed
79:22 through the ear and through easy voice
79:25 recognition
79:26 transcripting figure out what was spoken
79:28 around them
79:29 what words they chose to speak
79:32 and probably create as many of these
79:35 people as you possibly could and keep it
79:37 on them
79:40 probably during every single moment of
79:42 their day
79:43 even in the shower during sex during
79:46 eating
79:47 everything you might actually
79:50 you know get into sort of that apple
79:52 watch technology where you're studying
79:53 their heartbeat
79:54 their blood pressure all that kind of
79:56 stuff to big machine
79:58 learn how a human being behaves
80:02 you want to capture this by design it's
80:05 probably a bad
80:07 choice of words but that's that's what
80:09 i'm going to say in this particular
80:10 episode
80:12 now neurologically speaking for those of
80:15 you
80:15 familiar with the chemical structure of
80:17 the human body
80:19 you very well know that the slightest
80:22 imperfection in the human body
80:25 can create dispositions in certain areas
80:29 but we know that killers at times have
80:31 had tumors inside their brains
80:33 which cause their brain to malfunction
80:36 we know that certain people have
80:38 congenital issues where certain
80:40 chemicals are in ample supply
80:42 too much so sometimes it erodes over
80:45 time
80:46 kids who are early diabetic patients
80:49 have certain you know frailties within
80:53 their system
80:55 so at the same time that this person is
80:57 wearing this equipment
80:59 they would have to be inspected
81:00 medically to the maximum degree
81:03 as often as possible without harming
81:05 them of course these people don't really
81:07 care about that
81:09 but the other thing would be the human
81:11 observation being fed back into the big
81:13 machine learning
81:15 for any of you have children you know
81:18 that if you have more than one child
81:21 the likelihood that two children are the
81:22 same is
81:24 negligible nothing maybe madagascar
81:28 twins
81:29 the super duper identical twins have
81:31 very similar characteristics
81:34 i dated a girl once who was a monogamy
81:36 twin
81:37 one of the first events i went with them
81:40 was to their father's birthday party
81:42 and the two twins had not communicated
81:45 with each other
81:46 but they went to the store and bought
81:47 the same exact card
81:50 for their father can you imagine two
81:53 different cities
81:54 they probably physically saw each other
81:56 maybe once every two months at a maximum
82:00 and when it happened my girlfriend at
82:02 the time turned around at me and said
82:04 oh my god can you believe that she goes
82:06 you know what this has happened dozens
82:07 and dozens of times in our lifetime
82:10 the whole family backed it up it was a
82:11 family of seven
82:15 wow so i think
82:18 quite frankly that where we are
82:22 with above ground technology in regards
82:25 to robots
82:26 is way behind our ability
82:30 to actually do it i think we have
82:33 technology
82:34 and capabilities way beyond
82:38 what is being shown to the american
82:39 people or the human i should say
82:41 the entire world to be honest but it
82:44 does take a tremendous amount of
82:45 financing
82:48 so i think that your individuals that
82:49 could do this would be definitely
82:51 any government with a fairly ample uh
82:55 yearly income but also
82:59 eccentric people who have a tremendous
83:01 amount of money
83:02 and desire to do it now
83:06 would this technology be spent on a
83:08 newscaster who reports the weather
83:11 no would it be spent on a sports
83:13 personality
83:15 doing some narration for a sports game
83:18 no i mean would they immediately try to
83:21 replace putin
83:22 probably not right that's that's way too
83:24 high profile person
83:26 uh they probably just you know put a guy
83:29 in some
83:31 job somewhere you know they you know
83:33 it's just like westworld where they
83:35 actually
83:35 reenacted especially in season two
83:38 the creation of these hosts
83:43 and they showed um dolores
83:46 who was one of the original
83:50 robots that they ever created and show
83:52 how she
83:53 had to learn everything and everyone was
83:56 fairly monotone at the beginning
83:58 and then through software upgrades they
84:01 ended up gaining
84:02 an indistinguishable personality from a
84:04 human being
84:06 but imagine you had a coarse version of
84:09 what i'm saying
84:11 now it's pretty uh it's pretty likely
84:16 okay that boston dynamics robots are
84:18 aimed
84:20 at a couple basic functions they're
84:23 going to get along just fine
84:24 with the human race understanding that
84:27 these are metal robots
84:29 one would be the thx 1138
84:32 police officers with the cattle prods
84:35 for the agenda 21
84:37 in game of 2030 for the reduced world
84:40 population
84:41 and it's it's maintained by very overt
84:45 humanoid robots that you can't possibly
84:49 injure in any way shape or form
84:52 remember their their big thing about
84:54 boston dynamics robots is that
84:57 even when they started creating the mule
84:59 which is the cowl-shaped
85:02 vehicle they kicked it and kicked it
85:04 they kicked it on
85:05 ice man and the thing corrected
85:08 its feet i mean that
85:11 you have to understand about that
85:13 capability
85:14 is that they've written a program that
85:17 incorporates
85:19 probably a tremendous amount of big
85:20 machine learning but also fuzzy logic
85:22 algorithms that can
85:24 calculate probability
85:27 and the processor power on those
85:30 onboard computers i've never done the
85:32 deep dive to find out what those things
85:34 are running on if you can even find out
85:35 you probably can't
85:36 it's a super mega processor because as
85:40 the thing starts to fall okay and it's
85:43 feeling its equilibrium it's got all
85:45 kinds of those uh jars in it that you
85:47 have in your telephone that
85:48 knows what orientation is so you can put
85:50 it up to the stars and see where it is
85:53 it's thinking so quickly that it's able
85:56 to create a whole new
85:58 set of calculations and destinations for
86:01 all of its limbs
86:02 and as the calculation either succeeds
86:05 or fails it's correcting again
86:08 to achieve the most probable outcome
86:11 to keep it upright and the fact that uh
86:15 when they first did it they could knock
86:16 it over eventually and then
86:18 eventually they couldn't knock it over
86:19 anymore scary
86:22 amazing scary amazing and then the
86:24 humanoids
86:25 same thing push kick hit it with the
86:28 huge bar not gonna reverse there's the
86:29 cg guys that create the funny
86:31 videos where the robots uh
86:36 getting back at the guys and beating
86:37 them up
86:40 the other use for the boston dynamic
86:41 robots has been
86:43 communicated to us which is they're
86:44 going to be used as replacements
86:47 for various personnel on the battlefield
86:50 so the mules
86:52 have been sold to the american public as
86:56 the vehicles that will carry supplies
86:59 for infantry people so radios ammo
87:03 gun replacements all kinds of stuff
87:07 but again in the theater of war and in
87:10 the theater of
87:11 civil discipline the programs
87:14 although very complex and very amazing
87:17 don't have to be
87:18 anywhere near the stuff that we've
87:19 talked about in this episode
87:21 to get extermination to happen and
87:24 there's the black mirror episode where
87:26 the
87:27 little black dog robot runs around and
87:31 with just very little technology on
87:33 board can exterminate the human race
87:36 very easily black mirror for me
87:39 is the most predictive programming
87:43 show that's ever been put on tv i don't
87:44 think it's a mistake
87:46 it's not every episode or anything but
87:48 it's definitely some of the episodes
87:50 especially the little robot one if you
87:52 haven't seen that go see it
87:56 now in terms of these things being
87:58 available today
88:00 like a true replicant it would all
88:02 depend on
88:03 how early these programs meaning
88:08 projects were greenlit whether or not
88:11 they've lost funding at any point in
88:12 time
88:14 and it would depend on any of the
88:16 hurdles they might have run into
88:19 but regardless they want to warm up the
88:21 public wouldn't they before you
88:23 see i mean how alarming would it be you
88:26 go to the uh
88:28 was it the electronics show in vegas and
88:31 they pull out a human being that you
88:32 can't even tell imagine the host
88:35 uh comes out on stage and starts
88:37 introducing one of these clunky robots
88:39 and
88:40 just like westworld i think it's like
88:44 episode
88:44 two or three you find out the host
88:49 is actually the project and you've been
88:51 duped the whole time
88:53 that would terrify humanity absolutely
88:56 terrify humanity you would have
88:57 legislative
88:59 policies passed immediately to say where
89:02 these things could be used where they
89:03 could be used whether or not they have
89:04 asimov's
89:06 you know prime directives to not hurt
89:08 man honor itself not do anything that
89:10 would
89:10 compromise the first two rules that sort
89:13 of thing
89:15 so can you imagine that all this
89:18 sort of clunky stuff that we see out
89:21 there is simply warming us up
89:22 intellectually for the eventual product
89:25 that'll be ready the day that they think
89:28 that we're ready to see the big product
89:32 the full-blown android human being
89:35 that starts taking on amazing
89:37 characteristics
89:40 now let's talk about social media being
89:43 fed into this project
89:45 i don't know if you know this but uber
89:49 for instance what they are doing
89:53 is trying to harvest all of our travel
89:56 data
89:58 to then replace the drivers with
90:00 driverless cars like the johnny cab and
90:03 total recall that's been communicated to
90:06 wall street as a reason to invest in
90:08 them
90:09 they are doing what westworld did to
90:11 marketing
90:12 in a fictional sense they're doing that
90:15 to automative cars
90:16 automated cars i should say so now
90:19 imagine taking
90:21 all those intangible emotions that we
90:23 said we had to put an apparatus a human
90:25 being and have them
90:27 live their life while we're tracking the
90:29 entire experience
90:30 putting it back inside the big machine
90:32 learning because once you have
90:34 a data set of all five senses especially
90:38 the biological function of the human
90:40 body with the heart where it was high or
90:42 low or whatever
90:44 so you know cause and effect models now
90:46 algorithmically as long as you can
90:48 conceive of the metric that needs to be
90:50 tracked
90:51 your big machine learning is off to the
90:53 races man and with the power of quantum
90:55 computing
90:56 oh my god it's it's potentially uh
91:00 instantaneous relative to man's time on
91:03 earth
91:05 but now think about this we're on social
91:09 media
91:10 we're posting our lives on social media
91:13 our frequency of visiting social medias
91:15 based on what's going on on social media
91:18 it could be that the uh just the data
91:21 that they're collecting right now
91:22 can sense boredom can sense the 80d
91:26 [Music]
91:29 sort of adrenaline dopamine drops in the
91:32 brain
91:34 when we design video games i teach a
91:35 neurological class for
91:38 students that i design myself which
91:43 game design based on the chemical
91:46 structures of the brain
91:47 so that you understand i can't make you
91:51 have the success
91:52 constantly right you know yeah you know
91:54 it was a head shot headshot headshot
91:57 shot that bore you to death waste out
91:59 your chemical
92:00 supply in your brain and you would
92:01 eventually just start canceling out
92:04 headshot because it wouldn't be special
92:06 but if i designed the game to have a
92:08 fairly good course
92:10 this complex being an arena where you're
92:12 fighting
92:13 and i keep the count of people down to a
92:15 certain algorithmic balance with that
92:18 space that's allowed i know
92:21 on average the probability of you
92:23 bumping into an enemy
92:26 i can even just listen to the game and
92:28 find out we had too many collisions in
92:30 the game there's too many head shots
92:31 going on in the game so we need to bring
92:33 the number down from 20 people in the
92:34 arena
92:35 to 15 and see how that goes and once the
92:37 little pops
92:38 start to go in cadence with the brain's
92:42 ability to manifest the chemical up
92:44 to drop it into your system to give you
92:46 that high i got you
92:48 and i can make you really addicted to
92:50 that game and that's why
92:52 all the coin op games from the 70s were
92:55 so
92:56 utterly brilliantly designed you have no
92:58 idea if you haven't studied games on
93:00 that level
93:01 uh why we don't have arcades anymore
93:03 just blows me away
93:04 they're social the games were amazing
93:08 uh made a lot more money they were cool
93:11 plus all the other facilities we could
93:13 put in these arcades today would be just
93:14 tremendous you could put sports in there
93:16 you could do
93:17 e-games no matter what it'd be really
93:20 amazing
93:20 plus you could download various games to
93:24 various units
93:24 as long as the controls matched a
93:26 particular game
93:28 you could do it you could do if you had
93:29 four controllers you could do gauntlet
93:31 or a bunch of
93:32 four player games right but i believe
93:35 that through social media
93:37 metrics analysis a lot of that
93:42 intangible human behavior could be
93:44 captured
93:45 between instagram twitter facebook
93:49 we got you and that's a little scary
93:52 don't you think it's even one of these
93:55 things where you post a photograph
93:58 of your family at some outing you're
94:01 doing a boating trip or whatever
94:04 imagine the photograph being able to
94:05 what one
94:07 steal the gps data out of the photograph
94:09 which gives them place in time
94:12 time of day whether it was sunny or not
94:14 sunny
94:16 it could read all the faces and find out
94:18 who everyone is
94:19 and then use your hey everyone's my
94:22 cousin my sister my aunt my friend
94:24 because you really want to load up your
94:25 social media with the full metrics of
94:26 everyone who's
94:28 genetically related to you and they
94:31 could literally
94:32 calculate oh there's a bunch of smiles
94:35 on everyone's face oh but that one guy
94:37 in the back is not smiling
94:39 oh we scraped his face and found out
94:41 that he's actually
94:42 not with their party but we grabbed all
94:45 his photographs too
94:46 and he actually murdered his wife later
94:48 that day you know i mean just
94:50 the level of metrics that they can get
94:53 out of social media today
94:54 is way beyond your comprehension unless
94:57 you have a very autistic mind
95:01 so i don't think this is out of our
95:05 reach
95:06 again covert programs was it the
95:09 bioshock game
95:11 if you've ever played that game you'll
95:13 see
95:14 it's uh just so that folks that didn't
95:16 play the game understand what i'm
95:18 talking about
95:19 you play this game and you find out
95:21 somewhere i think in the 30s it's the
95:23 storyline
95:24 some billionaire dude had a city
95:28 built under the ocean a whole city
95:30 because he was tired of humanity
95:32 tired of all the mouth breathers and so
95:35 he built this gigantic city
95:37 somewhere on the bottom of the ocean and
95:40 invited only the most brilliant
95:42 people artistic people scientific people
95:45 into his city and they all covertly
95:46 lived on the bottom of the ocean
95:49 but something went wrong and you're the
95:50 character to go down to figure out what
95:52 went wrong
95:54 and they eventually i think in the third
95:56 version it was a city in this
95:57 in the clouds
96:01 that's the kind of thinking that would
96:03 fund and create such a project right the
96:05 island of dr moreau kind of stuff
96:08 and all these crazy experiments
96:09 genetically splicing everything on
96:11 planet earth together to see what
96:12 happens
96:13 i guarantee you that was real um
96:16 they put those movies out to make it
96:18 fictional in your brain
96:20 so if someone came up to you and said
96:21 you know there's a real island that did
96:22 that and there is one island i forgot
96:24 it's off the coast of new york i think
96:26 but as long as they put out a piece of
96:28 fiction
96:29 then your brain goes when you're in the
96:31 conversation was oh dude that's a movie
96:33 don't that's stupid
96:34 no one ever did that that'd be horrific
96:35 right and because you have a moral base
96:37 you can't conceivable what they do right
96:40 uh deliverance was to scare you
96:43 out of the appalachian mountains because
96:45 the mena arkansas drug trade was landing
96:47 in those mountains
96:48 when everyone freaked out to explore
96:50 that area of the world
96:52 because that's where the drugs were
96:54 coming in that's why that movie was made
96:57 so seditious man
97:01 insidious anyway i hope you dug the
97:05 episode i would be very interested in
97:07 your opinions about
97:08 all these things especially if you have
97:09 any expertise
97:11 in any one of these fields perhaps a
97:12 field i didn't even mention
97:14 and uh but i think this this episode has
97:18 a value to you and that as you harvest
97:21 scientific articles keep your eyes
97:24 peeled
97:24 for those little articles that end up
97:27 used to be an
97:28 omni magazine they had the red pages and
97:30 the silver pages
97:31 it was called the continuum or something
97:33 well i think the silver ones were called
97:34 to continue i can't remember what the
97:35 red ones were called but they would have
97:36 these articles
97:38 and i'll give you an example in 85
97:41 i read it in one of the articles that
97:43 they were having
97:44 they had conquered jets landing
97:46 themselves
97:48 or being well actually ai landing and
97:51 both remote control landing
97:53 and then when that event happened in
97:56 2001 it was oh my gosh they can really
98:00 land planes remotely and was like yeah
98:02 it's been an article
98:03 15 years ago so those things are
98:07 leaked out every once in a while and
98:09 they just disappear
98:11 you'll hear people uh creating all kinds
98:14 of inventions i think there was a a
98:16 japanese guy that created this this
98:18 crazy
98:20 kind of fiberglass lattice that was
98:21 supposed to replace all the highways in
98:23 japan
98:24 because it was indestructible and you
98:26 wouldn't let them film the entire
98:27 process but you saw it's kind of like
98:29 westworld where they were
98:30 little machine arms were creating this
98:31 lattice of this
98:33 of this mesh that was then coated and
98:36 encased and it was super duper resistant
98:38 like
98:39 tree wood you know
98:42 many of you probably seen the invention
98:43 where they they create solid
98:46 tires for big trucks instead of being
98:49 inflated and blowing up and splattering
98:51 all over your car
98:52 these truck tires are solid yes they
98:55 weigh a ton
98:55 but when they run over nails and other
98:58 things
98:59 no big deal just crushes them nothing to
99:02 pop because there's no air in it
99:04 that's a genius idea some of you follow
99:07 the concept cars that are coming out of
99:09 the
99:10 manufacturers like mercedes and audi
99:13 and bmw they have the active skeleton
99:17 the car
99:18 you know changes and has like scales and
99:21 all of a sudden it's breathing i mean
99:22 it's just
99:23 nuts crazy stuff we have liquid steels
99:25 now self-repairing steels
99:28 just imagine all this happening and i'll
99:30 kick it off
99:31 i'll sorry i'll end it off on this one
99:33 note which is
99:36 if you wanted to make if you could
99:38 conquer a fairly
99:40 fairly humanoid character that has
99:43 uh fragility right has some weaknesses
99:45 in it
99:48 and then you know the story of like
99:49 wolverine you could create
99:51 one that is absolutely invincible
99:53 invincible
99:55 imagine someone standing in a crowd
99:59 that cannot be killed that cannot be
100:01 injured
100:03 maybe massive amount of electricity
100:06 could kill it maybe a massive explosion
100:08 could kill it
100:09 but unless someone's carrying a bunker
100:11 buster under their arm
100:12 that thing's gonna wipe out everybody if
100:14 it wants to
100:16 scary so it might
100:19 behoove us to put some brain power into
100:22 possibilities in this realm
100:24 and it might behoove you to think about
100:26 how much of your own personal life
100:28 you're posting online to people like
100:30 mark zuckerberg
100:31 who sell you out to cambridge analytics
100:34 do you realize that every single private
100:36 chat you've ever had with somebody
100:38 on social media and facebook has been
100:41 sold
100:42 overseas to a foreign country behind
100:45 your back
100:46 when he told you that your your privacy
100:48 was guaranteed
100:50 unbelievable and then he told the senate
100:52 that even after the app is uninstalled
100:54 from your phone they can still listen to
100:56 your microphone
100:58 you can go to jail immediately
101:01 it shows you who's working with who
101:03 right
101:04 when you tell a cop that you're a huge
101:07 drug dealer
101:08 and your car is full of a bunch of
101:10 cocaine or heroin or something
101:12 be the epic bust of the century and the
101:14 guy says
101:15 well you just get on home you know what
101:18 camp he plays in
101:20 he plays in that camp it's real simple
101:22 man
101:24 so anyway if you haven't been to
101:25 deepthoughtsradio.com please go it's
101:27 where all the links are i'll give you a
101:28 short bumper today
101:30 it's got all the video audio social
101:32 media
101:33 it's got to all renew all remastered
101:35 season one it has ways to donate
101:37 both patreon and paypal to everybody
101:40 donates thank you so much you made the
101:42 intro possible you made this whole year
101:43 possible thank you so much
101:46 take care of yourself and someone else
101:47 and i'll see you in the next deep
101:49 thoughts
101:49 over now
102:04 [Music]
102:09 [Music]
102:12 so
102:16 [Applause]
102:21 [Music]
