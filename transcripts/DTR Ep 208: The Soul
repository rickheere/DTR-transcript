00:00 [Music]
00:32 back to the car please and gentlemen
00:36 this very nice afternoon Southern
00:43 California so today I'm going to attempt
00:47 to talk about the sole smoking this
00:50 really bizarre Ford Elmo cigar which I
00:54 don't know if I've ever smoked before
00:55 heard about it my buddy smoked this
00:58 I usually don't so the sole how can even
01:02 have a conversation about the salt let
01:04 alone dialogue by yourself for one hour
01:06 or more well if you've watched every
01:09 single show of deep thoughts you know
01:13 that we've touched on the soul several
01:15 times some episodes quite a bit what's
01:20 interesting about it for me is that you
01:22 you know when you say soul you
01:26 immediately depending on how much you
01:28 thought about the subject you'll
01:31 immediately bump into people or have the
01:33 thought yourself of Christianity or
01:36 whatever respective religion that you
01:38 worship that Christianity usually is the
01:40 one that especially in America obviously
01:43 that there's been a lot of fictional
01:45 stories written around Christianity that
01:48 talk about the soul right you know it's
01:49 the whole story of Faust selling sewing
01:52 and soul to the devil and that sort of
01:53 thing right and so because we have so
01:56 much you know a fictional content around
02:00 Christianity with Souls
02:01 it's tend to connect I mean you give me
02:03 right okay what I have found is the
02:06 longer that I have mulled over this
02:10 thing soul spirit spirits the other word
02:13 again I've said in episodes two years
02:15 ago that it was going to use spirit not
02:17 soul because it is more generic to the
02:20 concept and doesn't attach itself to
02:22 other paradigms but in this particular
02:26 one I'm going to say soul because are
02:28 they going to make a better title for
02:29 the episode and it will help orient
02:31 people to the episode in general right
02:35 when you start developing a scientific
02:39 approach meaning non-religious approach
02:42 towards the idea that we are symbiotic
02:45 creatures like Jadzia Dax from deep
02:51 space 9 that we have this spiritual
02:56 configuration of some sort of force some
02:59 sort of energy maybe it doesn't have any
03:00 force and then you have your body and
03:04 then the mezzanine between the two that
03:07 we always talk about in it and you know
03:08 Buddhist monks talk about this Hindu
03:11 gurus talk about this this is nothing
03:14 new
03:14 I'm offering no insight into this I'm
03:17 just reminding you that they have
03:19 classified the mind as this sort of
03:25 again the point between your body and
03:28 your soul you can take drugs and mess
03:32 with your mind
03:33 right you can drink too much and not be
03:35 able to walk across the true room true
03:38 what the hell is that you can take acid
03:40 and have a trip right but what I want to
03:46 encourage you to start doing with your
03:48 life is to if you believe in a soul then
03:52 you can jump right in and it won't be
03:53 speculative if you think as you know
03:57 you're full of [ __ ] there's no soul you
03:59 die you're dust that's it if you're
04:02 coming at it from a scientific
04:03 standpoint that takes the latter opinion
04:05 then do me this little favor I want you
04:10 on a day-to-day basis moment by moment
04:12 basis almost second by second it's not
04:15 split second by split second study the
04:17 various layers of your consciousness and
04:22 what does that mean well if I burned you
04:25 with the lighter
04:27 you know that that's your body dimension
04:30 if i betray you as a friend I have hid
04:36 your mind but I may have also you know
04:41 when someone passes away let's just say
04:43 it goes down to your soul it gets deep
04:46 and you may blow that all off you may go
04:48 the kurtzweil bag of chemicals root okay
04:51 there is an experiment and it was told
04:55 to me as Aristotle's experiment I think
05:01 that you know these these things get
05:03 passed down and they get romanticized
05:04 but it doesn't matter you can do this
05:06 and it's phenomenal don't do this if
05:08 you're driving if the experiment was to
05:11 create this pluralistic universe from an
05:16 atomistic universe there used to be this
05:19 time and you know it's only written down
05:22 and it's when we look at the rituals of
05:25 man we think we see atomistic rituals
05:27 which is to say that the spiritual realm
05:29 and the body realm were all one it was
05:34 as if there was no transformation for a
05:36 man to have dialogue about the spiritual
05:38 realm versus this realm you know they
05:41 have the most of the Day of the Dead in
05:45 Mexico right celebration of all the
05:48 relatives that are passed and it's a
05:49 very it's a very finite moment around
05:52 Halloween that they pull out of the
05:55 archives of their history this ritual
05:57 and then they put it back inside most of
06:00 the year now they have little trinkets
06:01 and stuff to pay homage to this face all
06:03 throughout the year just like someone
06:05 might have a little pumpkin in their
06:06 house
06:07 from the pagan
06:10 side of things by the way if you hear
06:12 nails pounding and stuff it's because my
06:14 neighbor across the street getting a
06:15 roof replace a special roof episode but
06:22 this this story came to me which was
06:23 this he's supposed to close your eyes
06:27 and envision a perfect circle and once
06:33 you see that you then open your eyes and
06:35 someone gives you a writing utensil and
06:36 says now write down on a piece of paper
06:39 a perfect
06:40 Circle and when you can't you now know
06:44 the difference between this realm and
06:46 the heavenly realm in the heavenly realm
06:49 one can conceive of in your mind a
06:50 perfect circle perfect cube perfect
06:53 anything but in this world it is
06:56 exceptionally difficult to render the
06:59 perfection of heaven on earth so that
07:04 divided up the two and made people
07:08 understand you can't fully access the
07:11 spiritual realm that you can envision
07:12 just by closing your eyes later several
07:18 thousand years later we had man create a
07:22 fake narrative that their creator has
07:26 out sourced salvation to only a few men
07:29 in the Vatican apparently you have to do
07:32 a number of explicit favors for these
07:37 Catholic priests to get saved but what
07:41 I've noticed is in my own realm of
07:43 taking the soul and taking all the
07:45 religion out of it and just letting it
07:47 be a logical organ of my existence right
07:53 every moment of a day can be parsed in
07:59 the symbiotic manner where I say what am
08:02 I feeling right now you know because I
08:06 live in I don't know about you but I
08:07 live inside the chamber of my mind my
08:09 consciousness my mind's eye as they say
08:12 is right where my pine Neil Glenn is and
08:15 that's where my consciousness exists for
08:19 these eyeballs are very interesting but
08:23 I feel I feel a conduit within my head
08:28 I do yes I do have obviously sensors
08:32 that definitely tell me I've stubbed my
08:33 toe but isn't it strange how we still
08:37 feel that our bodies are fairly
08:39 alienated from our being I'll give you
08:43 an example that nearly every single one
08:45 of you have done and probably do on a
08:47 daily basis maybe not every night you
08:51 know when you crawl in the sheets under
08:52 the sheets in your bed
08:55 especially in the wintertime or if you
08:57 have a cooler room at night you start to
09:02 feel the fact that your body is a fairly
09:04 large object right your feet go all the
09:08 way down depending on how big you are
09:09 goes all the way down to the bottom of
09:11 your bed and if you get overheated what
09:14 do you do you stick a leg out from out
09:17 of the sheet to create a radiator to
09:20 radiate the heat out of your calf or
09:23 whatever it is until you kind of cool
09:24 off and you pull it back in oh my god
09:26 it's all toasty warm in there and you
09:29 just keep kind of going back and forth
09:31 anytime you were a little kid and you
09:33 created a fort but it wasn't big enough
09:36 for your whole body or you put your head
09:37 inside of a box and all of a sudden
09:39 you've got this kind of virtual reality
09:41 made of cardboard around your head and
09:44 it was a different world but your feet
09:46 are hanging outside this box but you can
09:49 give a [ __ ] about your feet it's a weird
09:51 thing how many of you can be in the cold
09:54 as long as you keep your upper torso
09:55 warm you can your legs can be out there
09:57 in the snow and it seems like it doesn't
09:59 matter seems like it's a whole separate
10:02 jurisdiction of responsibility and your
10:04 brains really you know almost just
10:06 barely responsible for its autonomic
10:08 blood supply that's about it you
10:10 probably understand what I'm saying here
10:13 we adopt a paradigm when we're young
10:15 that we are the total sum of our body
10:20 the five senses and we sort of walk
10:25 around carrying that around but in the
10:26 end I think on a second to second basis
10:28 you are feeling in parsing yourself into
10:32 little tiny pieces the little areas you
10:35 do know the difference between a smell
10:36 and a taste a feeling you know hearing
10:42 something versus seeing something you
10:44 understand the difference but you also
10:46 understand the beautiful marriage of all
10:48 these senses coming together you do and
10:52 that's the first step if I were to teach
10:56 a class on this on a college I would
10:59 spend you know first two weeks
11:02 creating experiments and examples by
11:05 which the students understand
11:08 that they already subliminally
11:11 understand that there are different
11:13 pieces of consciousness that they
11:15 interact with eat every second of every
11:17 day and hey you know when you go to the
11:19 movie theater your sense of touch and
11:23 sense of smell
11:24 go secondary to your sense of sight
11:26 sight and sound you know now if someone
11:30 brings up a big nice buttered popcorn or
11:33 opens up those Twizzlers or red vines
11:35 you're definitely going to get the sense
11:37 of smell and it all combines into this
11:39 nostalgia this pattern recognition of a
11:42 good time so later on when you bring
11:45 this [ __ ] home you smell and taste and
11:48 here you're all that same stuff you
11:49 start to feel kind of like you're at the
11:51 movie theater but not quite I dearly
11:54 hope that theater is rebound and I'm
11:59 working on something might make another
12:01 sector of life rebound but won't say
12:03 anything until we get it Rowand now it
12:05 took me several serendipitous decades to
12:08 get to the point where I could really
12:10 start to recognize in my 40s that I do
12:15 believe that I can sense completely not
12:18 only my soul and I'll give you I'll give
12:21 you the criteria of what makes me
12:22 believe it's my soul versus my body or
12:24 any bag of chemicals but the other one
12:27 is my connection to the universe once I
12:29 found it it was almost as if I found the
12:33 and I've been roaming around the world
12:35 it's apocalyptic everybody's dead I'm
12:37 the only one on planet earth and I find
12:38 a terminal and the terminal was sort of
12:42 like my soul and the more I put data
12:44 inning search data out that's going to
12:46 some make-believe database in the
12:48 universe there's no power hook to it or
12:50 know how this damn thing is working
12:51 seems like that's the connection to the
12:53 universe right yes
12:56 very obscure example here's my criteria
13:01 my personal criteria for what I believe
13:04 to be my soul it feels pure and it feels
13:12 100% mature
13:16 it seems to be the quiet voice inside me
13:19 that brings me solutions on a rare
13:23 occasion it will bring me a rhetorical
13:24 question sort of like that now why did
13:29 you do that are you should do this it
13:34 seems as if it's almost an elder of
13:37 infinite wisdom within me and the
13:41 frustrating part is that I feel like it
13:43 is me not being John Malkovich with ten
13:47 people living inside my head some guy
13:49 obsessed with his spunk and when I act
13:52 like well I'll put this way when I act
13:54 in any manner of which I regret and you
13:57 know for me it's the subtleties of
13:58 behavior here and there oh my god I
14:01 probably should have been more reserved
14:03 there or I should have been more caring
14:05 or whatever it's that voice it's that
14:08 feeling it's not only a voice but it's
14:10 just a feeling that has sort of
14:12 telepathy thought processes I keep
14:15 getting a Gestalt of a of an emotion
14:17 which is a full you know they say a
14:19 picture's worth a thousand words or the
14:21 word Gestalt is if you take that picture
14:23 and turn it into a giant information
14:25 packet however many words a picture is
14:27 worth infinite ten thousand whatever you
14:31 call that the gestalt it comes into you
14:34 as a pattern of like something you can
14:38 create a differential image of so you
14:41 have a feeling which is a bunch of
14:44 pieces of information built on
14:46 everything you take in your history your
14:48 five senses maybe some six ten to the
14:50 seventh whatever and then you take the
14:52 Gestalt from your soul which is the
14:54 exact amount of information and you slam
14:58 them together and whatever is left after
15:01 the cancellation either adds or
15:05 subtracts from the pattern that is where
15:09 I make my judgment as to whether or not
15:11 I'm happy with my behavior or not so
15:13 happy with my behavior sometimes it's
15:16 just neutral well I guess I could have
15:18 done that but I just chose the other
15:19 thing know our feelings right there's
15:23 the old saying you know stop and smell
15:25 the flowers right
15:26 all right I want you to attempt and
15:31 don't know obsess of course but attempt
15:34 to feel what you really feel and try to
15:38 give it some sort of three-dimensional
15:40 space model if you can meaning the
15:45 Asians for instance are very sensitive
15:49 to this and they always ask you what
15:50 your gut feeling they recognize as an
15:54 entire culture that your gut is where a
15:57 lot of information is stored your
15:59 intuitive gut and they map it to various
16:02 glands of the spine of your body and I
16:05 think that's beautiful one of the ways
16:07 you can really feel your consciousness
16:10 and how it behaves and it you know way
16:13 outside of any cellular tissue that had
16:15 you happen to be borrowing from the
16:17 universe at that one particular time is
16:18 deprive yourself asleep what does that
16:23 mean just stay up really late ones you
16:25 can fake this by getting up too early
16:27 and trying to stay awake let's just say
16:30 you're like man I never can get up at
16:31 five o'clock get up at five o'clock stay
16:34 in bed and stare at the ceiling even if
16:38 it's black in the bedroom and just try
16:40 to keep your eyes open and keep your
16:42 eyes on but get yourself comfortable at
16:43 the same time so your body's fighting
16:45 your will to stay awake and at that
16:49 point start to realize and start to feel
16:53 the physical 3-dimensional consciousness
16:57 that you have you're probably not
16:59 worried about the tip of your toes but
17:02 you're going to feel this if you're like
17:03 me you will literally feel some level of
17:06 consciousness almost falling out of your
17:08 head into the mattress and at times when
17:11 you fall asleep you will virtually feel
17:16 like your soul has fallen off a cliff
17:18 and it'll do like these dives but then
17:20 it comes back it's like roof oh my gosh
17:23 you're so weak because you eventually
17:25 you'll lose the ability to stay awake
17:28 it's a beautiful thing there's also just
17:33 a very basic thing you can do is anytime
17:35 you've had your emotional state
17:38 significantly change
17:41 either for the negative or for the
17:43 positive there's a weird almost what I
17:48 like to call like the saran wrap moment
17:50 where a reality that is very
17:52 three-dimensional and something you can
17:56 experience sort of shrinks and it comes
18:02 around you and it becomes very tight for
18:04 that moment and you're either in glee or
18:07 you're in horror and that is when you
18:11 feel much different about who you are as
18:13 a being it's almost as if you're going
18:16 through such a moment of trauma that
18:20 your soul goes I am going to show up a
18:24 lot more intensely than I have in the
18:26 past
18:27 to help you deal with this either you
18:30 won the lottery and you've got 120
18:32 million dollars waiting for your you
18:34 just to make the phone call and you're
18:36 like wow all that pain all that
18:39 suffering is gone oh my gosh I now can
18:43 travel the world write that movie write
18:46 that book get that girl get that guy
18:48 have ten kids whatever it is it's just
18:50 the pain of life just when wool right
18:54 and then there's the other half which is
18:58 somebody broke up with you or you lost
19:00 your job or my gosh you know Hillary
19:04 Clinton didn't get elected or you're
19:07 potentially about to get injured you're
19:09 in a car car wreck and you know slow
19:11 time slows down when the car wreck
19:13 happens and I think that's very
19:14 interesting this somehow through just a
19:18 and again you you could blame it on
19:20 adrenaline but I will tell you this much
19:23 adrenaline is not an airbag and airbag
19:28 was to do it pops in a fraction of a
19:31 second that's why it breaks your [ __ ]
19:33 nose and burns you up and break a rib
19:36 and I mean they're really brutal
19:38 depending on how you impact them right
19:40 luckily I've never had this happen to me
19:42 personally just at a conversation with a
19:44 buddy of mine today who had a very close
19:47 friend who's gets severely injured by an
19:49 airbag and the sad part was the impact
19:51 wasn't that big there
19:53 did most the damage on his body but it's
19:56 you know it's the it's the trade-off we
19:59 have right but adrenaline cannot in my
20:02 opinion and all the studies that I've
20:03 done on neural chemistry it can't dump
20:06 in and within you know 500 milliseconds
20:09 give you this amazing rush and slow down
20:13 time because the for time to slow down
20:14 for you what that means is that your
20:17 processor got really fast and it's over
20:20 cranking the camera meaning instead of
20:22 being 30 frames a second it's now doing
20:24 60 to 100 frames a second so everything
20:26 for you start slowing down what's very
20:28 interesting if you've ever been in a
20:30 situation of a car wreck and I've been
20:33 in a couple of these you actually have a
20:38 relative to you the speed that you're
20:40 going it's as this you don't really
20:42 speed up your brain can look at look
20:46 around inside this accelerated I should
20:49 say actually slowed down over cranked
20:52 camera phase and you can think
20:54 completely normal I had a kid once I was
20:57 18 I had my own car I bought one driving
21:01 home from work about 11:30 at night some
21:04 [ __ ] in front of me was stopped on
21:06 the [ __ ] highway there comes a kid
21:08 behind me 18 test driving a car having
21:10 just totaled one six months earlier had
21:12 told the story once but he hits me right
21:14 hits me he raced me on a pass which is
21:18 what got everything messed up and it's a
21:20 really windy road called the 118 which
21:22 is very dangerous in California no
21:24 visibility cars were coming so for some
21:26 goddamn reason like 11 o'clock at night
21:29 there was just seem to be a bunch of
21:30 cars out there so I probably should have
21:36 slowed down let him go
21:37 past me but I was already way past him
21:39 and so he was just sitting in my [ __ ]
21:41 blind spot and I'm eighteen you know my
21:43 skills are relatively good but I go
21:46 around him I slow down I don't hit the
21:49 car in front of me at all and those kids
21:51 lost complete control because he's
21:52 already was [ __ ] meaning well the
21:54 guy that owns the car is in the
21:55 passenger seat watching him total this
21:57 car but he starts losing control hits
22:00 hits my rear left quarter panel and I'm
22:04 not quite sure what part of the car it
22:05 was but he flies across the highway
22:07 a two-lane highway with orchards and the
22:11 orange orange orchards and the orchards
22:14 have about a one and a half foot Bank of
22:17 dirt before you actually get into the
22:20 orchard I believe it's for irrigation
22:22 damming anyway hits this thing and that
22:25 sends a car up in the air right so I'm
22:27 not looking to my left I'm going normal
22:30 he's barely bumped into me but he
22:32 described my back bumper and I'm
22:34 watching him in slow motion roll his car
22:37 over on its on its top
22:39 it's a 1976 Dodge Challenger lands on
22:43 the top but I'm watching you know that
22:46 he hit this dirt and so the dirt spit
22:48 clawed the dirt are coming off in front
22:50 just like a Hollywood scene but I
22:52 remember I'm thinking completely normal
22:54 it's as almost as if I just went into a
22:55 time capsule and I'm going really really
22:57 fast but I don't feel like I'm moving
22:59 quickly at all but in mine I live with
23:03 at the time had a head-on collision at a
23:06 intersection nothing serious but he was
23:09 probably got about 20 but he came home
23:12 and said my god time slowed down and I'm
23:16 look at him like this just happened to
23:17 me and he said my motherhood just
23:20 crunched right in front of me really
23:22 really slowly so this has happened to
23:26 multiple people those experiences and of
23:32 course there could be plenty of neural
23:34 explanations for why the brain can
23:35 suddenly in a state of hysteria speed up
23:39 right but again in terms of my personal
23:44 research and you know it's not as deep
23:46 as people with PhDs enter the course but
23:50 to dump a chemical cocktail in the brain
23:52 and get it to respond within a
23:54 millisecond is pretty pretty phenomenal
23:56 because this kid was probably in the air
23:57 no longer there Michael Jordan you know
24:00 but I'll tell you it felt like three or
24:02 four seconds to me these are the unique
24:06 moments in our existence we can start
24:09 feeling the difference feeling a 3d
24:11 space 3 oh sorry or three dimensional
24:14 disconnection with the body now again
24:20 well could come in and go that's just an
24:21 illusion created by the neural neurons
24:24 in your brain giving you a sort of more
24:27 scent a cloud sense of your existence I
24:31 think because there's so much data once
24:36 you start paying attention to these
24:37 unique moments you'll start to realize
24:40 there are dozens and dozens of moments
24:43 that you have lived with your entire
24:44 life that seemed out-of-body there are
24:49 people who listen to the show who claim
24:50 to astral project and again most people
24:54 full of [ __ ] when they say that as I've
24:55 said in comments because they never have
24:58 any decent examples right if you asked
25:00 your project okay come to my house
25:02 what what's on my bed what's in my
25:05 office I'm going to put a little trinket
25:07 out on the coffee table you're really
25:09 traveling the universe will come over to
25:10 my place but if you know where it is
25:12 tell me what I got there tell me never
25:17 any anything like that they just want
25:18 the alkylate that they're [ __ ] you
25:20 know aliens or whatever the reason why I
25:23 bust people's balls who make these
25:25 claims is that in order to get to the
25:28 truth with the capital t we've got to
25:30 get rid of the [ __ ] with a capital B
25:32 these [ __ ] that come in and
25:34 essentially for their own ego their
25:38 disempowering the entire group the
25:40 entire room to pay attention to a bunch
25:44 of [ __ ] that doesn't matter that never
25:46 really happens that never has any
25:47 clinical proof that it happens you know
25:50 if I said that I left my body at night I
25:52 would go figure out something you know
25:55 where the [ __ ] are these you know
25:57 bankers you know I mean I figure out
25:58 something that we can use right
26:00 near-death experiences
26:04 what's interesting about scientists
26:06 about near-death experiences because I'm
26:08 going to come at this the opposite
26:09 direction right
26:10 when I say near-death experiences almost
26:12 all of you've ever heard a story you
26:15 could write down right now before I say
26:16 it what you think I'm going to say and
26:18 you're probably 95% correct
26:21 so let's come at it from the opposite
26:23 direction for those of you who are sick
26:26 and tired of pop science this is for you
26:28 baby
26:29 scientists come in and they'll say well
26:32 you know
26:33 people say they see tunnels of light I
26:35 have nothing else light when they die
26:38 and if they have created this complete
26:42 [ __ ] theory all right just a guess I
26:47 mean cats off to them for guessing but
26:49 what does the scientists try to do when
26:51 anything gets outside of their ability
26:53 to put everything in a [ __ ] box or in
26:56 a nutshell they want it back in the nut
26:59 shell they want their their total lack
27:04 of dedication to science in general and
27:06 reality to be just enough for all of us
27:09 right yes there's an ice cream truck
27:12 that comes through the neighborhood I
27:13 live in an awesome place we just tell
27:15 you but they'll try to say that there's
27:17 a collection of chemicals that dislodge
27:19 from the brain during death and they've
27:22 they've arbitrarily claimed that these
27:26 chemicals will somehow splash on the
27:29 visual cortex giving it full charge to
27:32 give you a full RGB light that is white
27:37 and they'll say that any any state of
27:41 euphoria that you feel is merely your
27:43 brain trying to create some sort of
27:46 sedative for what your brain understands
27:48 is a traumatic moment of death seriously
27:52 seriously what I find interesting about
27:56 nerds cut blossom I've been one I've
28:01 managed them work beside them even if I
28:05 did manage them is that they end up
28:08 feeling very insignificant in the world
28:10 because the world itself ignores them
28:12 and this is where we get sociopaths this
28:16 is where we get crazy people that want
28:17 to watch the world [ __ ] burn to the
28:19 ground
28:20 somehow the world didn't give them
28:23 enough and so when you feel
28:26 insignificant what do you try to do you
28:28 try to get to the opposite you try to be
28:30 significant on the non nerdy world
28:35 you've got people claiming a bunch of
28:36 [ __ ] that they can't remotely prove to
28:39 you because it's fictitious astral
28:42 projection claims
28:44 so one side we got the hippie lies on
28:46 the other side we got the pop silence
28:48 lies pop science lies says hey before
28:51 you had this theory I couldn't define I
28:54 had complete control and jurisdiction
28:56 over your brain in this particular area
28:58 because Hey look at my look at my
29:00 memorize and repeat certificate I got
29:03 here called a degree there has to be a
29:06 group in the middle which is hopefully
29:08 us and says we don't have we don't pass
29:11 out trophies
29:13 we don't have degrees what we want to
29:16 have is our excuse me great
29:20 conversations where we think we actually
29:23 think and we're very very careful about
29:26 any conclusive theories that don't have
29:31 plenty of doors to continue the theory
29:34 or dismiss the theory now sure I'll make
29:39 an episode and I'll tell your gravity is
29:41 ether aways goddamnit that's what it is
29:43 in my brain I can see it in 3d a hundred
29:46 percent and I mean literally I can see
29:48 the macro to the micro it all completely
29:50 just clicks it's just beautiful
29:53 and considering that I've spent 30 years
29:56 trying to use the phenomenon model to
30:00 explain gravity it's interesting with
30:02 some kid that's banned I banned him off
30:04 the the YouTube comments he's unaware
30:08 that he's banned he just writes all he's
30:10 got Tim comments and I can only see him
30:11 in this one little portal where I can
30:13 see the comments of a banned person but
30:16 this kid is he is my God he's got neil
30:20 degrasse tyson's you know skid marks all
30:23 over his nose and he thinks Bill Nye is
30:25 a [ __ ] genius unbelievable it's Kai
30:29 but in reality he wants to live in the
30:32 Wikipedia definition of gravity which is
30:34 it was like that in the first sentence
30:37 the word phenomenon is the very basis of
30:39 what they've got out there all right
30:42 well when it comes to spiritual science
30:47 we don't have any right go to a church
30:51 and they will tell you just to have
30:53 faith it's there then you go up to the
30:56 science realm and they simply say
30:58 doesn't exist in your fool for thinking
31:00 otherwise well neither one of those
31:03 disciplines are ever going to get you to
31:05 do what I've just explained the first 30
31:07 minutes this episode which is chill out
31:09 slow down and realize you do not feel
31:16 guarantee you I don't care who you are
31:19 you do not feel like you are one entity
31:22 right now wherever you're sitting you
31:24 can feel you are this weird amalgamation
31:28 of a bunch of things all right you know
31:32 if you're not driving your car reach out
31:35 one of your hands as far as you can and
31:38 then touch something with the tip of
31:41 your finger and tell me you think like
31:45 think that that feels like that's inside
31:47 your brain anytime you have a head cold
31:51 it's the biggest pain the answer you got
31:53 a toothache or something like that right
31:56 ain't any pain it's in the cranium
31:59 region of your body it's the most
32:01 debilitating isn't it because your brain
32:05 is trying to liaison in my opinion with
32:08 this higher consciousness your soul your
32:11 spirit and when your brain and your body
32:15 especially your head is experiencing
32:20 pain pain is only the proprietary
32:25 classification of a certain amount of
32:27 certain type of energy that comes from
32:30 all your pain sensors in your body but
32:32 it also relies tremendously on
32:35 electricity to to take to report itself
32:38 in so if you've got a pinched nerve
32:40 somewhere it is the pill is the
32:43 debilitating as it could possibly be I
32:45 got a buddy of mine that had some
32:46 surgery for a hernia and the doctor
32:49 [ __ ] up and when he put staples into
32:52 his hernia the wall of his stomach he
32:55 accidentally pinched a nerve and my
32:59 buddy spent nearly a year with this
33:03 horrible horrible pain that not only
33:05 have been the problem their pain
33:07 obviously is you know you could have a
33:08 staple in your gut but you're feeling it
33:10 down the backside of your
33:12 llegar up your ass crack or whatever
33:13 right so it doesn't report exactly where
33:15 it's pinched but nearly destroyed his
33:18 life and it almost destroyed his
33:20 marriage he was definitely very cross
33:22 with his child and he eventually found
33:27 the number one nerve specialist in
33:29 America the guy went in and said this
33:32 [ __ ]
33:33 stapled one of your nerves I'm going to
33:35 undo this and within it was nearly an
33:38 outpatient surgery he was reborn and
33:44 this is an extremely brilliant human
33:46 being so in terms of him dealing with
33:49 the pain he tried to deal with it and
33:51 then eventually when he was reborn he
33:52 had to go to his wife and his kid and
33:55 say I am so sorry I have been this
33:58 monster but you have no idea what it was
34:01 like to have this constant artery of
34:03 pain going into my brain it was
34:05 short-circuiting my ability to be a
34:07 loving person to even feel like I was a
34:09 person they made him nearly feral you
34:13 know but when you don't have something
34:16 like that oh I should say this if you
34:19 ever vacillated between the two you have
34:22 some condition you pass the goldstone
34:23 everyone so he passed a kidney stone
34:25 every once in a while something else
34:27 that reports in you throw out your neck
34:29 you throw out your back don't you feel
34:31 like you're reborn when it's all over
34:33 and for young people eat right and
34:37 exercise otherwise you'll you will sadly
34:40 learn this lesson that most of us would
34:43 never wish on anyone but okay so I've
34:47 massaged your brain a little bit on how
34:49 to take inventory of who you are as a
34:51 person again it's three dimensional
34:52 space where do you feel like you are
34:54 with any one sense that you have the
35:00 intellectual side up is I want you to
35:02 tell me exciting the example I gave away
35:06 earlier in the episode here haven't you
35:08 ever done something and either before
35:12 you do it a voice inside you saying you
35:15 shouldn't do this you know that right
35:17 for any of you've ever been with someone
35:19 sexually that you shouldn't have been
35:21 with perhaps you don't have protection
35:23 and you're willing to have sex without
35:25 protection
35:25 some random stranger because you're
35:27 drunk or whatever or they're just so hot
35:31 you can't stop yourself
35:32 perhaps you're cheating on a
35:33 boyfriend/girlfriend a spouse whatever
35:36 it is you just told a white lie on the
35:38 telephone so you can create this space
35:40 in your life to have this moment you
35:43 know there's that little thing inside
35:44 you this is you shouldn't be doing this
35:47 an interesting thing is it seems to be
35:50 pretty damn mature and it just kind of
35:51 lets you do it it's like well here's the
35:53 Rope man there's more rope you're gonna
35:55 [ __ ] hang yourself a go ahead we'll
35:57 watch right and the fascinating thing
36:01 about is once the Truman Show movie came
36:03 out with Ed Harris and Jim Carrey you
36:06 you actually had the spectators outside
36:08 of his little geodesic dome that were
36:11 watching and enjoying his bad decisions
36:13 and it's almost that feeling you know
36:17 being John Malkovich had a really
36:19 complex version of that same thing I
36:21 believe Woody Allen had one as well
36:23 right but I want you to be aware of that
36:27 voice because the other thing is is that
36:30 after you do it your mind will also say
36:37 wasn't that foolish don't you feel silly
36:39 having done that now sadly I believe
36:43 that a lot of vaccinations today
36:45 medicines and poisons are able to
36:49 short-circuit the various neurons in
36:52 your brain I'm not quite sure how it
36:54 works although I have seen a
36:55 presentation once by a military
36:57 organization that was absolutely [ __ ]
37:00 balls out trying to destroy this in
37:03 mankind but to create these functional
37:05 robots that don't care you know you see
37:08 these videos online all the time
37:09 depending on what kind of videos you
37:11 watch where you know someone dies in a
37:15 car accident and they're walking across
37:17 the street and they get nailed by a car
37:18 they're not looking both ways typically
37:20 in third-world countries that don't seem
37:21 to [ __ ] teach you to look both ways
37:22 before crossing the street but there's
37:25 always someone that's about 10 feet away
37:28 walking about 1 mile an hour and I read
37:31 their phone they're [ __ ] around
37:32 whatever or just sitting at the bus stop
37:34 watching boom a body you know vaporizes
37:38 and there isn't a single goddamn
37:41 response out of these people they don't
37:43 seem to make a phone call to call 9-1-1
37:44 or whatever it is in their area they
37:47 don't seem to rush to see if the person
37:48 survived they don't they don't even gas
37:50 they go oh my god it was the worst thing
37:52 I'd ever seen in my life they're just
37:55 [ __ ] robots it's weird
38:01 so if you're not one of those people
38:03 then you are perfectly qualified to do
38:06 this analysis on that inner voice now
38:10 I've said on the policies of the
38:12 universe a few other episodes about the
38:15 universe that this is a program right
38:20 the universe is a program and it's
38:22 running perfectly every second of every
38:25 day right palm tree I'm staring at right
38:28 now never turns into a dinosaur or a
38:33 telephone pole or a TV it stays a palm
38:36 tree and it's following all the rules of
38:38 a bush the girls straight up and it's
38:41 called a tree you know it doesn't Vasily
38:45 I don't Vasily I don't for half the show
38:47 I'm not in Paris and I come back to this
38:50 patio it's following beautiful rules the
38:53 reason why I mentioned this is what if
38:55 the the very substrate of existence is
38:59 perfect because it can't be anything
39:01 other than perfect and your soul is made
39:08 of that perfectness because what else
39:11 could it be made out of if your soul
39:13 which is little subroutine inside the
39:15 master program of the universe somehow
39:17 had bugs in it we wouldn't exist
39:21 probably if I wouldn't hang on to your
39:23 body predicated on the idea that it
39:27 exists why does telling a lie always
39:31 make you feel like [ __ ] and telling the
39:33 truth oh god what a relief
39:36 you know sitcoms sitcoms have one basic
39:41 formula you want to be a writer for a
39:42 sitcom here's the secret sauce they
39:45 never [ __ ] teach you in sitcom class
39:47 in the first five minutes an incident
39:51 occurs
39:52 and the information that reveals that
39:55 incident is hidden and then it takes
39:59 approximately 15 minutes to reveal
40:03 totaling 20 minutes the problem and in
40:06 the last five minutes you have everyone
40:09 reconcile the mystery you know Fresh
40:13 Prince of bel-air
40:16 Will Smith breaks a vase that is an
40:20 heirloom to the family it's worth
40:22 $50,000
40:24 and obviously he's in trouble so he
40:27 hides all the pieces and parts and then
40:28 we go 15 minutes where everyone's
40:30 looking for the vase and a bunch of Lies
40:32 funny lies have been told to manifest up
40:34 the mystery to make it even more
40:36 outrageous and more crazy and in the end
40:38 he just says I'm sorry Andrew whatever
40:42 [ __ ] name was I broke the vase and she
40:46 just says well why didn't you just tell
40:48 me [ __ ] happens man I'll forgive you oh
40:51 my god I feel so much better and the
40:53 moral of the story is don't lie and we
40:57 as the viewer paid for the experience
40:59 while watching commercials during these
41:00 shows because we loved the tension and
41:03 release formula right that theme music
41:06 comes on oh man that's a warm fuzzy
41:08 thing could be cheers could be mash
41:10 could be whatever the hell you watch on
41:11 TV then the concealment tension tension
41:14 tension for 15 minutes as long as we
41:16 want to actually feel the tension we
41:18 want to feel longer than that in the
41:19 sitcom when it's supposed to be funny
41:20 and we're getting little pod little
41:23 capsules of jokes along the way in the
41:27 end ah man they wrapped it up
41:29 beautifully I'm watching cheers right
41:31 now with the buddy of mine we're
41:32 dissecting the hell out of the show and
41:34 it's one of the most masterfully written
41:36 shows out there crazy how beautiful this
41:39 thing is but that's our life in one way
41:43 that's the way our life goes you know
41:48 people that are [ __ ] starters a lot of
41:52 times is because their life is so
41:53 mundane the truth becomes a neutral
41:57 feeling doesn't feel positive it feels
42:01 neutral so let's go [ __ ] start they say
42:05 let's lie about something happening
42:06 let's be the devil and needful things
42:08 and just start [ __ ] and just watch the
42:12 [ __ ] place burn right here's what's
42:16 interesting let's take this back into a
42:20 metaphor that is typically associated
42:22 with souls and that is a religious
42:25 construct right what does religion do
42:31 I'll probably do an entire episode on
42:33 this religion says sorry animals like a
42:38 car wreck out there religion says that
42:42 God has chosen the most vile [ __ ]
42:46 humans on planet Earth
42:48 white male pedophiles to be the proxy
42:53 between you and God if you're Christian
42:56 and if you don't follow their rules
42:59 you're going to go to hell
43:04 God's a big [ __ ] by the way in this
43:07 format but if you I guess
43:12 bend over the altar enough they'll give
43:15 you a little bit of salvation and you'll
43:16 get to heaven alright but now what if
43:22 you are a symbiotic creature your true
43:26 being which is your soul can't be
43:31 imperfect it can't because it is part of
43:34 the universe and the only relative deeds
43:37 that you've ever done that are positive
43:39 or negative are based on the relative
43:40 rules of this particular existence that
43:43 you are punching into which is humanity
43:46 so right you die your body dies one your
43:52 body doesn't have any command over your
43:54 soul at all except that if you keep your
43:57 temple clean meaning you know your brain
44:02 is working well you're not you know
44:04 sucking down too many chemtrails I've
44:06 taken too many vaccinations you're not
44:08 eating too much toxic food your mercury
44:13 filled tuna
44:15 you have a great connection to your
44:19 spiritual being you're still that being
44:22 but you can be living in peril
44:25 you could be in a car accident and your
44:27 brain gets injured and so for the
44:29 remainder of this life you may or may
44:32 not recover from the injury right but if
44:36 the second that you die the only thing
44:38 that is left is your pure soul which
44:41 can't have any flaws in it otherwise it
44:44 would cease to exist what judgment will
44:48 be left right what judgment would be
44:52 left on your soul where your soul hasn't
44:55 done anything wrong your soul has been
44:56 sitting there the entire time you know
44:58 it for a goddamn fact that guarantee it
45:00 it's been telling you what to do right
45:02 it has been there to advise you here and
45:08 there it asks rhetorical questions why
45:12 did you do that even that was stupid you
45:15 know a lot of times us you know those of
45:19 us who were young and had lots of
45:21 relationships you know especially the
45:23 more you try to make them serious
45:25 variably someone will hurt your feelings
45:28 you know where they meant to or not
45:30 whether or not they're being devious or
45:32 not doesn't matter it's definitely not
45:35 what we wanted to hear it's definitely
45:37 not what we want to experience and maybe
45:38 we said something back we did something
45:42 maybe we broke something or something
45:43 like that second you do it maybe even
45:46 the milliseconds before you do it you
45:50 you know you're about to do something
45:53 totally stupid but you do it because in
45:56 your body is the child your body is
46:00 young and it's being chemically
46:03 structured to match sort of the overall
46:07 intent and wisdom of your soul but it
46:09 takes a while sometimes and perhaps it
46:13 is even a genetic bell curve
46:16 you know perhaps if your family's lived
46:19 a fairly privileged life and they've
46:22 been able to you know increase the
46:25 neural density of a brain and then they
46:27 spawn and then your brain as
46:30 comes in more dense than you have few
46:32 more circuits to process and you still
46:34 go through the same phases but you go
46:36 through them way faster than someone who
46:38 has lived in a family it has been
46:40 repressed from education from maturity
46:44 from whatever the situation is and they
46:46 come in with a brain that is not quite
46:48 as dense you know this this stuff about
46:51 genetic code is very provable and what's
46:56 interesting about the whole bell curve
46:57 thing there was a guy that came out it
47:01 was late 80s early 90s and he was
47:02 talking about the bell curve of
47:04 intelligence and he said there
47:06 definitely is a bell curve of
47:07 intelligence and it is related to you he
47:09 made the mistake of saying race and
47:11 that's not really that true what he
47:14 needed to say was it is related to
47:16 repression and oppression and it just so
47:20 happens that you can overlay in some
47:22 areas of the world where various races
47:25 due to racism have been repressed but
47:30 what's interesting about it is and this
47:33 is going to be just an arbitrary example
47:34 it doesn't have any scientific backing
47:35 it's not true necessarily but I'm just
47:37 going to give you an example let's just
47:39 say there's a tribe somewhere doesn't
47:42 matter what color they are but they live
47:45 a beautiful rewarding life in a
47:47 rainforest and a desert they know how to
47:50 turn the soil to create crops they know
47:53 how to hunt the animals to eat you know
47:54 how to protect themselves they are happy
47:58 they're not unhappy
48:01 maybe they suffer more slings and arrows
48:03 of famine and you know monsoons and that
48:06 kind of stuff because they don't know
48:08 how to shelter themselves against as
48:09 much as perhaps the rest of the modern
48:11 world but in that particular group of
48:13 people it might be that they don't have
48:18 terribly dense neural nets in their
48:21 brains because they simply don't need it
48:24 doesn't mean they're stupid doesn't mean
48:26 they're unhappy especially doesn't mean
48:28 they're unhappy I would assume that a
48:30 lot of these folks are way [ __ ]
48:31 happier than Ellison this whoo I got a
48:33 60-inch television world but if you live
48:37 in the dog-eat-dog world of the first
48:38 world or if you live in some
48:42 heavily repressed although very stressed
48:44 out world of you know the manufacturing
48:46 community of India the manufacturing
48:48 community of China you are developing
48:51 these really intense brains but it's all
48:54 under you know sort of duress but that
48:57 can still create an amazing human being
48:59 that then goes ah I figured out how to
49:01 escape boom I'm out of here right you
49:05 know this is these are the sort of the
49:06 basis facts the basic facts I should
49:10 probably say we're arbitrary migration
49:13 doesn't make any sense at all you cannot
49:16 take Neanderthals from one part of the
49:18 world and say oh look at their big brows
49:22 and look at their hairy backs let's just
49:25 move the yetis into you know downtown
49:27 Manhattan and we'll just teach him how
49:30 to go to the Opera you know when certain
49:35 factions follow you know codes of law
49:39 that are two to three thousand years in
49:42 the past and they're militant and their
49:44 violence and they teach you know anyone
49:48 to teach their people that anyone
49:49 different than them should die but what
49:52 do you do you go back and you blend the
49:54 two together right but once we create a
49:57 world where people live in a beautiful
50:00 simple happy world and I mean these
50:03 tribes are the people that used to be
50:05 Adam istic I'm willing to believe
50:06 there's plenty of atomistic tribes that
50:08 still exist really believe the spiritual
50:10 realm and the physical realm are the
50:12 same thing well we can't prove are some
50:17 of the tales that we've heard from
50:18 spiritual men in each one of these
50:20 regions of the world where you had again
50:22 Native American shaman some people say
50:24 Shaymin they said they saw the spirits
50:29 they said they you know they they
50:30 actually offer services where they can
50:32 actually tell the spirits what to do and
50:35 you know sometimes fairly immature
50:37 concepts that I don't know may or may
50:40 not be true but I just had an employee
50:43 who was a Native American and I was
50:45 again writing this movie but actually he
50:48 actually was I guess finishing it when I
50:49 first met him and he graduated from
50:51 Stanford mathematics he was not an idiot
50:54 but I said you know
50:55 maybe you can help me get some of the
50:57 research that I've been not being able
50:59 to get out of books out of Stanford
51:01 about Native American you know spiritual
51:05 beliefs that are sort of shrouded he
51:07 said i-gos you know he goes I I could
51:12 maybe take you half a dozen times to the
51:15 reservation that I go to and after they
51:18 trust you they might start revealing
51:19 things but he goes I can just tell you
51:21 right away but they believe you know you
51:25 said that one of the weirdest practices
51:26 that we practice is Native Americans and
51:28 the tribe that he belonged to which I
51:30 can't remember what tribe it was he said
51:32 that we hired shamans to to take spirits
51:36 that did not leave this realm due to
51:39 their level of evil and sort of being
51:42 unfulfilled you can't leave until you're
51:44 fulfilled that's sort of a Native
51:45 American belief which is great but he
51:47 said you keep reincarnating until you're
51:49 there or you're just stranded soul but
51:52 they I guess can can try and attach
51:56 these Souls to people and create
51:58 disorder in their lives maybe even death
52:01 and disease and accidents and all kind
52:02 of stuff and you're saying worshipers
52:04 you believe a very similar thing with
52:05 their principalities run by their
52:08 leaders you know but now some people
52:11 might say well dude you're just making
52:16 [ __ ] up because you can't understand how
52:20 to interpret all of the emotions that
52:23 you're going through all the senses that
52:25 you're going through maybe maybe but
52:29 here's the thing I would say that just
52:34 like most dissenting comments there is
52:38 there are two types of dissenting
52:39 comments in the world there are your pop
52:42 science people and those who are
52:43 memorizers and repeaters they tend to
52:45 knee-jerk dissent meaning they haven't
52:49 personally thought about the concept
52:51 that you're mentioning more than the
52:53 moment that you mentioned it but because
52:55 it hurts to think and they don't think
52:57 that often perhaps that you have a you
52:59 know they've got a block between their
53:01 processor and their their ears or
53:04 whatever the case might be they can't
53:06 think and so for them they understand
53:09 the dilemma that you've brought up
53:11 perhaps it even concerns them and they
53:13 need that dilemma to go away and so they
53:15 need you're sort of like just swatting
53:17 away you know be that's flying around
53:20 their face if they just relax the Beale
53:23 fly off but you have to have some
53:25 thought process to realize the bee
53:27 doesn't want to do anything with you
53:28 besides smell you to see if you've got
53:30 pollen on you in the second he realizes
53:31 a year of no benefit to his world he
53:34 flies off those and finds a flower I
53:37 have put a tremendous amount of analysis
53:40 into this for multiple years and I'm not
53:42 I honestly will tell you I don't know
53:44 when I started I spent a couple years
53:51 are about 2013 and 2014 really studying
53:58 sleep deprivation because again I'd read
53:59 this book it told me that a lot of the
54:02 experiments with sleep deprivation have
54:04 discovered that the longer that you stay
54:06 up eventually your left brain goes to
54:07 sleep your logical brain goes to sleep
54:09 and your right brain wakes up and that's
54:11 why a lot of creative people work at
54:12 night because there's this natural cycle
54:15 that your left brain is so [ __ ] anal
54:17 that it just follows the schedulers loop
54:20 it's it's ten o'clock we must go to bed
54:21 when your right brain goes yeah whatever
54:23 dude Joey I'll be out front here playing
54:26 on the computer painting on a canvas
54:28 whatever when you play with sleep
54:30 deprivation it's very interesting
54:33 because a lot of your anal paradigms
54:37 that you hung on to is you know the
54:39 stuff that you have to manifest as a
54:41 child to know where you are in the
54:43 universe right
54:44 the scariest thing if you're a parent
54:47 the scariest thing is the infection of
54:52 your child's mind and I will say that
54:55 this is just a layman's interpretation
54:57 of the information I've got out of
54:58 Stanford about this whole thing really
55:00 studied children's brains and some of my
55:03 friends were had their kids in this
55:04 stuff why I had a child of my own the
55:08 first five years are I don't know it
55:11 would seem four times more important in
55:13 the next five years and the next five
55:15 years for between five and ten are also
55:17 infinitely important around twelve your
55:21 kid starts to get to that right of that
55:23 that Jeanette
55:23 right a passage where they need to start
55:25 making decisions on their own I was an
55:28 early bird in that cycle you know my my
55:32 cultural sort of pop culture influence
55:35 as a kid as far as I can tell looking
55:38 back I spent a tremendous amount of time
55:40 by myself because I was an only child
55:41 and when I got moved around so much that
55:44 any friends that I may were very
55:45 short-lived you know everyone's whom I
55:48 got to live my hometown and eventually
55:50 come nice to my hometown but maybe Tom
55:53 and Jerry maybe The Jeffersons maybe
55:56 good times you know some some good
55:59 wholesome television shows which we're
56:00 not trying to push in morality always a
56:04 moral up to take at the end of the show
56:05 so by the time the world started getting
56:08 dark here and there I already had my
56:11 feet on the ground and I realized what I
56:14 wanted to be and what I wanted to live
56:15 by and that super duper help I developed
56:19 I believe personally but now imagine the
56:21 kids today I look at Facebook feeds all
56:23 the time one of the sickest things I see
56:26 because people don't usually take too
56:29 many pictures of their kids watching
56:30 television but it does happen every once
56:32 in a while but can you imagine anything
56:34 on television you let your kids watch
56:35 today I can't but the worst thing is
56:40 seeing a child hold a telephone an iPad
56:44 a tablet and thinking of how they could
56:49 bump into anything on the internet
56:50 that's out there right or play a little
56:52 game or something obviously not
56:55 everything is evil and not all parents
56:56 are bad so a lot of folks are doing this
56:58 and they are you know policing their
57:01 kids from Bad content I think we may
57:05 even be having a you know Renaissance
57:07 2.0 for the old value systems right but
57:12 I by no means believe that it's the
57:14 majority of society that's doing that I
57:16 think the majority of society is raising
57:18 a bunch of cable guys here's the TV
57:22 will you leave mommy and daddy alone
57:25 okay well then victory and then when the
57:28 kid gets all [ __ ] up starts becoming a
57:32 little bastard teenager now the parents
57:35 are blaming the child
57:36 why the hell can't you be a good child
57:41 even if they don't say it to the child
57:44 child's our children are empathic to
57:46 their parents right that's why I think
57:51 lying to a child is probably one of the
57:52 most fruitless things on planet Earth
57:55 I can't say I have any experiences of a
57:58 child reading actually sorry I actually
58:01 will give you a very vivid experience of
58:03 when my daughter did this but you know
58:06 when you lie to your kids about all the
58:08 fictitious things like Santa Claus and
58:10 Tooth Fairy and all that kind of stuff
58:11 you might be doing them a lot of harm
58:14 because they're looking at you going why
58:16 are you lying to me
58:17 and they feel it deep down inside
58:20 because their soul is connected to your
58:22 soul because you have some sort of Union
58:25 which is why you gave birth to them in
58:26 the first place or help conceive of them
58:29 it could be just simply tuning to them
58:31 because they happen to live with you
58:33 since the moment they're born my very
58:37 few times in my life that I ever get
58:39 access to my daughter and cuz I'd shared
58:41 custody and very you know very makeable
58:44 situation but I had to drop her off one
58:47 time with the buddy of mine who was
58:50 living with his girlfriend at the time
58:52 I'm not sure they were engaged maybe
58:53 they were and there was this weird
58:57 tension between my buddy and his
58:59 girlfriend not like the good news is
59:00 I'll tell you the Paul heart of you
59:01 ahead of time they're married to this
59:03 day they have two children and they're
59:05 very very happy but I think without
59:07 trying to create some sort of feel-good
59:12 story here I think that my kid did
59:14 something that actually made them bond
59:16 way more at a time when they needed that
59:19 extra umph to get over this
59:21 communication barrier they had because I
59:24 was on one side hearing the guy side of
59:25 the story and I could kind of see the
59:28 other side and I had some friends who
59:29 knew her on the back side I was very
59:30 good friends with both of them but you
59:31 know I don't sit around talking to her
59:33 about their relationship but there was a
59:38 moment when they were sort of it looked
59:40 like they're about to break up and
59:45 no one really had any opinions about
59:48 either one of them we didn't say that
59:49 we'd know and I don't think anyone felt
59:51 that they should be together or should
59:52 be a part we just didn't have opinions
59:54 about that kind of thing sort of felt
59:56 like wasn't our business right but my
60:00 kid was over there hanging out in their
60:03 environment and it was awkward they were
60:06 sort of awkward to be with because you
60:08 could tell that there was some
60:09 communication needed to happen either
60:10 one of them are big communicators at the
60:12 time but there was a point where they
60:15 were trying to trying to get my kid to
60:16 do something or maybe discipline her or
60:18 something I can't remember but they made
60:20 her mad
60:21 she's about I don't know six or seven
60:25 years old and my kid pulls out of thin
60:28 air and she got me in trouble this was
60:29 crazy she pulls out of thin air if she
60:34 goes he doesn't love you and you don't
60:37 love him and your guys are going to
60:39 break up and she storms off and then my
60:44 buddy my buddy contacts me like within
60:47 the day and he goes so what have you
60:50 been saying about us I'm like what are
60:53 you talking about he goes well what do
60:54 you must have said something in front of
60:55 your daughter I'm like okay I'm lost man
60:58 tell me what you're talking about he
61:00 said well your daughter said this and
61:02 there's no way in hell a little child
61:04 could have said that without being
61:07 programmed by an adult to his point I
61:09 would have thought I would have thought
61:10 the same exact thing but I turned to my
61:13 girlfriend when he was telling me this
61:15 and I said do you remember say anything
61:17 disparaging about the two of them and it
61:21 really I didn't say anything concerning
61:23 until there the night before their
61:24 wedding because when he said why he
61:28 wanted to marry her it was all clinical
61:30 it wasn't love it was she's domesticated
61:33 that's all he could come up with and
61:34 what it what it really turned out to be
61:36 was that he's he just he was a loving
61:39 guy and he just you know it's his first
61:41 relationship really and you know it was
61:44 disorienting for him to commit to a
61:46 marriage just like anybody had a little
61:48 bit of cold feet but he you didn't
61:50 really have any cold feet at all he just
61:52 acted weird around us and the three guys
61:54 that were his friends I'm one of the
61:56 three the three of us hive minded up to
61:59 like is he doing the right thing because
62:01 he seems really strange right me seems
62:03 like it's missing any of the Hollywood
62:06 versions of love that were accustomed to
62:08 seeing prior to a successful marriage
62:10 and the beautiful thing is he didn't
62:13 have that Hollywood [ __ ] and he made
62:14 it work which is kind of neat and again
62:16 they're happy as could be they have
62:17 great kids it's awesome now here's the
62:19 thing I I know I didn't program my kid
62:23 something resonated between the two of
62:27 them my kid felt it and said it and what
62:29 ended up happening was she got it she
62:32 immediately started crying the other
62:34 girlfriend and because her greatest fear
62:38 was exactly what my daughter had said
62:40 and the upshot was I picked up my kid
62:45 again you didn't tell anything right
62:46 when I picked her up she told me a day
62:47 later with him the day within 24 hours
62:51 and they ended up that night sitting
62:53 down and communicating for the first
62:55 goddamn time in the way that they needed
62:57 to communicate he was able to dispel her
63:01 worst fears his girlfriend's worst fears
63:03 and I think looking back it was one of
63:06 the most healthy things that ever
63:08 happened to them someone called their
63:10 [ __ ] bluff it was no seven year old
63:12 kid six or seven she was really young I
63:15 think that that has to do with sort of a
63:19 connection on the soul level my kid was
63:22 not indoctrinated with a bunch of crap
63:24 as a child I constantly taught her
63:27 science I taught her philosophy I taught
63:29 her everything so that she would have
63:31 the basics to then go off and become
63:34 whatever she wanted to be we feel like
63:37 we have best friends we feel like we
63:39 have quote unquote soul mates
63:40 I think that's an over optimistic
63:45 characterization of another person given
63:47 that we only need a couple people you
63:49 know I mean you know what do we what do
63:51 we meet in terms of sheer numbers of
63:53 people that we would consider living a
63:54 rest of our lives with I really doubt
63:57 that most people of that even 20 people
63:59 that they're like I want to marry you
64:01 right it's very few people that we
64:03 actually cross that line with and we
64:04 think outs let's do it now you may
64:06 consider every partner a partner to
64:09 marry until they do something really can
64:11 I guess it's not going to work out
64:13 I love them to death anyway you know I
64:14 won't go the whole distance but we'll
64:16 hang out for as long as this lasts right
64:19 but I think we're all connected and I
64:22 think that when you meet someone that
64:23 you've never met before and you feel
64:25 like you've known for your whole life
64:27 mmm there might be some proximity on the
64:31 other side that you've perhaps spent
64:33 life together at a different time you've
64:36 been friends before helped maybe even
64:38 brothers and sisters mother father
64:40 maybe you've been spouses before it just
64:43 happens there's nothing about a bag of
64:46 chemicals in a skull that's ever going
64:49 to make that really explain itself
64:51 someone might try to feed you a bunch of
64:53 [ __ ] of like oh you know your neural
64:55 patterns must be very similar and
64:56 therefore you're you sort of can finish
64:59 each other's sentences because you just
65:00 happen to be Kalinka Dinkley identical
65:03 with the trillions of cells you got in
65:04 your brain you just happen to have the
65:06 same configurations or enough
65:09 compatibility in your brain that it just
65:10 works out yeah maybe maybe but again if
65:15 you become aware of the way that you
65:17 feel things and how you feel them and
65:18 where you feel them you know
65:21 intuition intuition will be a whole
65:24 different bag of beans man your gut
65:27 feeling I guarantee you every single
65:31 person hearing me right now you have
65:33 compromised your gut feeling before
65:35 right and what happens a little word
65:38 called regret starts to enter your life
65:41 and again regret defined by me is
65:44 something that you are regretful for
65:48 that you can never change
65:51 you can never undo it it is a moment
65:54 lost in time it doesn't have to be
65:56 something cataclysmic but it can just be
65:58 cod you know why did I do that and it's
66:02 usually that moment when you go against
66:04 your gut and you know you had a good you
66:08 had a good partner that could have been
66:09 your husband or wife or whatever and you
66:12 cheated or or they weren't even you're
66:15 not even cheating it's just you had a
66:16 choice and you you went down a road of
66:19 lust that you knew is with the shallow
66:20 person but boy that gave you that
66:22 physical reward that you were looking
66:24 for
66:25 and we all know the physical rewards are
66:27 very short-lived and just an analogy
66:30 before I close this off a lot of people
66:34 struggle with their diet they get heavy
66:37 and they eat too much sugar too much fat
66:39 or something study this the next time
66:44 you eat the your favorite candy or
66:46 something right you're eating it and as
66:50 long as your mouth is chewing it up
66:53 especially this goes really well with
66:55 sweet things right you're chewing it up
66:57 and you're getting this incredible
66:58 you're almost sexual response from this
67:03 churning food in your mouth
67:04 boom boom boom oh my gosh it's just the
67:07 best thing you've ever had but then you
67:10 swallow it and you take a swig of
67:12 something especially water water is the
67:14 best one to do this with sushi is very
67:16 much like this for me I eat sushi and I
67:18 love it but the second I drink water
67:21 after it's as if I have never had any
67:24 sushi besides the horrible breath I've
67:25 got for few hours right but even if I
67:28 eat the favorite candy or something and
67:31 I wash it down with water it is as if I
67:33 have never eaten it and the high is gone
67:35 and the reason why I've been able to
67:38 tame my sweet tooth is I remember the
67:41 depression a teeny tiny micro depression
67:44 that happens the second that I take the
67:46 swig of water and it's completely gone I
67:48 think this isn't worth it that little
67:53 tiny high is not worth me looking in the
67:55 mirror the next day and caring around
67:58 the penalty of that tiny little moment
68:02 of happiness that sugar can do to the
68:05 neurons in your brain all right sugar
68:08 and cocaine have the same goddamn
68:10 addiction in your brain so does caffeine
68:12 right now some caffeine is based on low
68:15 sugar and some caffeine can come in a
68:16 coffee cup and you're okay so hopefully
68:22 this was useful for beginning the
68:25 lifelong course of discerning the
68:28 difference between your body your soul
68:30 and your mind feel the difference
68:35 because you can and you always have
68:38 you may just not have recognized it you
68:41 may have not had someone like myself
68:43 just call it out and say that's
68:45 different right right and again I did
68:49 this little experiment a few episodes
68:51 back about blocking the eye contact with
68:55 someone that's a real good example of
68:57 your soul sit with someone back to you
69:01 know the difference is Skype with
69:03 someone that you really dig and get a
69:07 perfect connection on the Internet
69:08 perfect monitor Skype with them and see
69:11 how that feels and then sit down with
69:12 them on a sofa look them right in the
69:15 face and tell me that isn't a shit-ton
69:16 better and what's really happening if
69:19 they're sitting across from you they're
69:21 not necessarily touching you you don't
69:23 necessarily feel the warmth off their
69:25 body but then being in the room with you
69:27 your soul proximity is all the
69:30 difference in the world
69:30 and once you're sitting right in front
69:32 of them reach up put your hand up there
69:35 and block out the eye socket without
69:39 sunglasses on and realize how much of
69:41 your spiritual connection disappears and
69:43 then pull your hand back and go wow
69:45 there really is a soul hope you feel me
69:50 deep thoughts radio.com for all the
69:53 feeds there's a locked facebook group
69:55 you're more than welcome to join again
69:57 your your Facebook profile has to have a
69:59 little bit of history before I let you
70:00 in that's the only thing
70:01 every post is moderated 99.9% goes
70:05 through repetition will be filtered out
70:10 if you posting someone else think as
70:12 both of you are racing to say that some
70:14 celebrity died which we don't do on our
70:16 site but you know what I mean there's
70:19 video if you are living in an audio
70:21 there's audio if you're coming in a
70:22 video your video sources are YouTube for
70:26 all videos however episode one like I
70:29 said sorry season one is kind of messed
70:31 up with copyright problems get to the
70:34 music I use at the intro if you want to
70:36 see all that unimpeded go to vid me
70:38 instead of com you type em e VI T IME on
70:43 podcast
70:44 there's iTunes and Google Play if you do
70:49 iTunes we could use a few more reviews
70:50 and
70:51 anyway I really appreciate you guys the
70:55 comments have just I swear to God D the
70:59 subscriptions go really really slow and
71:00 believe me that's that's good for us we
71:03 don't want to be on joe rogan show and
71:05 get you know 20,000 new subscribers and
71:08 then have to deal with you know 80% of
71:10 them bitching and moaning because we
71:12 happen to think for ourselves right so
71:15 it's good that we have a nice qualified
71:17 group of audience members they come and
71:20 they go so don't worry if the
71:21 subscriptions go down a particular week
71:23 sometimes I'll lose you know five
71:25 subscribers and then I get these
71:26 messages for folks oh my god what's
71:28 going on you should do a video on this
71:29 to get him back it's like hey it's
71:31 alright it they didn't realize it was a
71:35 variety show because I forget to mention
71:37 that every once in a while or it's just
71:39 not for them and that's totally fine but
71:41 everyone's been really great so thank
71:43 you so much take care of yourself and
71:45 someone else and I will see you in the
71:47 next key thoughts over now
