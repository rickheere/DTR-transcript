00:00 [Music]
00:34 welcome back to D thousand gentlemen on
00:39 this sort of brisk California morning as
00:44 you can see we are taking a you may not
00:47 know it but this is a user this is a
00:49 listener request and a quite a good one
00:51 at that I'm going to be putting together
00:55 a episode here on black mirror and going
01:00 through the actual episodes and drawing
01:02 some similarities between it and it's I
01:05 think inspirational predecessors plural
01:08 such as Twilight Zone and the other
01:13 series prior to Twilight Zone radio
01:15 series X minus one I've never smoked a
01:18 Camacho's cigar so far it feels like
01:22 this is made of like tissue paper some
01:26 one but this is gonna light like fuse
01:27 see what happens here by the way today
01:31 we hit six point three million minutes
01:34 listened which equals twelve years and
01:39 so I want to say a big shout out big
01:42 thank you to all of you who have
01:43 listened over the years this channel
01:46 technically for the first I don't know I
01:50 guess two years is that right I think
01:53 it's about two years we did a hundred
01:55 episodes of another show called MKULTRA
01:57 radio if you go all the way back to the
01:58 back you only be talking about this we
02:02 pulled that show for a number of reasons
02:05 one the world has started to wake up a
02:08 lot I think that
02:10 bloody information was just even though
02:13 we had a great time on the show super
02:14 funny super interesting we just grew
02:18 past the way that we would have either
02:21 dealt with the information or the way we
02:23 believe in that information today so we
02:25 sort of would need to rerecord nearly
02:28 every narrative there to keep it
02:30 up-to-date so my buddy Kyle and I were
02:33 90 minutes apart one way so it makes it
02:36 sort of unfeasible for us to there's
02:39 infeasible unfeasible for us to get
02:42 together without me driving 45 minutes
02:46 north him driving 45 minutes south and
02:47 finding someplace in the middle of the
02:49 record so it's always been about cigars
02:51 in backyards and so he has a beautiful
02:54 place up in Malibu and I have a really
02:58 cool place here Huntington Beach but we
03:00 might continue recording I have an
03:02 unreleased episode that we did last
03:03 summer we cut together recorded had a
03:06 good time and then I haven't had a
03:07 chance to edit the thing yeah pretty
03:10 good smoke off this thing so black
03:13 mirror thank you for being patient with
03:15 the intro it is amazing to me when this
03:20 happens and this is no criticism of
03:22 anyone when a show like black bear comes
03:25 around released in 2011 and I think BBC
03:29 four I think which is their more
03:31 experimental Channel over there I could
03:34 be wrong but I think that's what it is
03:35 and they aired I guess a couple years of
03:38 this with three episodes per season
03:41 which is nothing it's this wild thing
03:43 that they do they just put a little bit
03:44 of cash in America needs to learn how to
03:46 do this but it didn't really take off
03:49 and as I understand it
03:53 Netflix going around looking for
03:56 anything that had some grit to it right
03:57 went over there and I guess paid just a
04:02 tiny bit amount of money for it and
04:04 brought it to the United States
04:05 obviously probably a global release
04:07 re-release and all of a sudden we just
04:11 bumped into it right I didn't have
04:12 anybody anyone excuse me uh recommend it
04:16 to me I just found it on Netflix I
04:18 watched it and then all of a sudden I
04:20 was like oh my gosh this feels like a
04:22 Twilight Zone
04:23 and the very first episode unfortunately
04:28 doesn't have a twist in it really I mean
04:33 it does have a technical twist in it I'm
04:35 not going to be spoiling these episodes
04:37 for you so do not worry what I will be
04:39 doing is the
04:40 hopefully the ultimate set up for you to
04:43 go watch each and every episode but the
04:46 first episode is sort of not a good I
04:49 mean I loved it I thought it was
04:51 fantastic but and I'll get into reason
04:53 why here in a short second but the
04:56 second episode of season 1 is where you
04:59 really start to feel that the ingenious
05:01 nature of these writers and I don't know
05:03 anything about this show I don't know
05:05 who the hell is making these episodes
05:07 I'm sure now since season 3 especially
05:11 season 4 that we're in for a ride I mean
05:16 this is it's probably just a tremendous
05:18 amount of writers working on this stuff
05:20 I would love to take some of my
05:22 treatments and move them into black
05:24 mirrors which I'm actually gonna
05:25 probably attempt here in the next six
05:26 months but it's great I've shown it to
05:29 amazing people in Hollywood and it's
05:32 funny like okay so but my point was got
05:34 him all over the place here my point was
05:36 when these shows debut and they're
05:38 amazing and you know about them for two
05:41 years and your friends have no clue that
05:42 they exist and then you ask people that
05:45 are that always kind of this is no
05:48 critique of them but they pride
05:49 themselves on being the authority of
05:51 sort of edgy where scripts are because
05:54 this is my group of friends constantly
05:58 write stuff but they won't know the show
06:00 exists you're kind of like really you
06:02 know it would be almost almost like it's
06:09 1989 crew has I believe they'd released
06:14 their first time by then whatever I just
06:17 forget the years one year after Motley
06:19 Crue's released their first album and
06:21 starts to blow up all over the world you
06:24 go into someone from perhaps the 70s who
06:27 you know it's not stupid and you go if
06:30 you heard of this band Motley Crue they
06:31 go no what's that and you're just like
06:32 man where are you where are you this is
06:35 where it's happening
06:36 and this is gonna dictate the next 10
06:38 years of music you got to get into this
06:41 right so black mirror is a gym
06:45 first and foremost black mirror is the
06:50 name of your television when you turn
06:53 your television off it's a black mirror
06:55 right absolutely brilliant title the
06:58 opening sequence is sort of this tick
07:00 down of kind of synth little sounds and
07:04 it's creating the black mirror logo by
07:06 jumbling up some characters and then it
07:09 eventually cracks your television and
07:12 I'm just telling you when it's that cool
07:16 usually cool things follow for instance
07:18 when twilight zone came out you know and
07:20 you really listened to the intro and you
07:22 look up what the twilight zone is being
07:25 again like I said my last episode the
07:28 mezzanine between dream reality and
07:29 reality reality as we've defined it
07:31 today and Rod Serling you know put
07:35 together this idea that when you're in
07:36 that middle you can you can slip into
07:38 that kind of pseudo reality world where
07:41 things can happen that can't normally
07:43 happen right and I think that's
07:46 brilliant
07:46 utterly Britain so Black Mirror being a
07:49 little name of your TV especially with
07:52 all the predictive programming and this
07:53 show is all about prophecy and
07:56 predictive programming I think we're off
07:59 to a really good start here you have two
08:03 options when I do this show with this
08:05 kind of episode take some information I
08:07 think you really want to hear and hold
08:09 it to the very in like a dick or tell
08:12 you right at the very beginning so hey
08:14 guess what we're gonna go at this right
08:16 at the very beginning now the The
08:18 Adventures of Black Mirror could
08:19 potentially completely disagree with me
08:21 about where they got their inspiration
08:23 but I think it's very clear that they
08:28 eventually very quickly got to the
08:30 formula of The Twilight Zone which is to
08:34 have a really interesting set up that is
08:36 utterly gripping keeps you sort of on
08:41 your toes and they have a formula for
08:43 how they do it they have two different
08:45 layers of the formula
08:47 the first layer of a black mirror is to
08:51 take a piece of technology again this is
08:53 not necessarily the first episode and I
08:57 can't say well actually it is it is part
08:59 of the immediately part of the second
09:01 episode of the first season which again
09:02 we'll get into is you take either
09:03 technology or a social direction of like
09:08 societal development and you take it to
09:11 the next level of full evolution and
09:16 then they show you how dangerous that
09:20 could be for you so for instance I'm
09:24 gonna give an example of one they have
09:25 not done but we have cars that are
09:29 starting to drive themselves and they're
09:30 having all kinds of problems killing
09:31 people running into you know trash
09:34 trucks and all kinds of stuff but they
09:36 would write an episode where they take a
09:38 driving car go to the next level of a
09:41 driving car and then create some huge
09:44 twist as to what just a simple
09:47 technology of driving the car could mean
09:49 in a negative way maybe putting one
09:52 other attribute on it where you know I
09:55 mean I'm just gonna ride on the fly here
09:57 but imagine someone you know harvesting
10:01 body organs and they start taking over
10:03 people's you know auto drive the car
10:06 controls your locks it literally just
10:08 drives you to a new location and they
10:13 put you in a warehouse and kill you and
10:15 you're sitting there screaming pushing
10:16 against the windows but whatever reason
10:19 they the computer the car actually
10:22 content your windows and so you know
10:24 electronically and so they no one can
10:25 see you scream you know perhaps a child
10:28 in the back of a car sees it he tries to
10:30 tell their parents and their parents you
10:32 know say stop imagining things stop
10:34 making things up right and then what
10:38 black meter does beautifully is the
10:40 initial premise of what I just
10:41 fictitiously wrote was the car takes you
10:44 and gets you murdered somewhere what
10:46 black mirror does is the beautiful job
10:48 of what you anticipate at the end of
10:50 this journey is either they're holding
10:52 back it probably would hold it back to
10:54 the very end what's actually happening
10:56 to you but they'll flip it two or three
10:58 more times and so that
11:00 it rattles and unravels and unravels and
11:03 you know the the guy that did 6 cents
11:07 and unbreakable and you know all these
11:11 other scripts I forgot it I always call
11:13 him
11:13 Shyamalan ding damn I forgot his real
11:15 name he he did that what they call film
11:20 school ending and when ended up
11:23 happening I wasn't present during this
11:25 time period but after The Twilight Zone
11:27 got really popular I guess that became
11:30 sort of a little mechanism to create
11:35 because I mean you're in film school you
11:36 create a some sort of production once a
11:39 week for four years and you're not only
11:44 creating your stuff but you're helping
11:45 your friends create their stuff so
11:46 you're constantly on set constantly
11:48 filming and filming and filming and one
11:51 of the gimmicks to make it interesting
11:52 because they barely had enough time to
11:54 write a script and get it done was to
11:56 create this cool little twist on the end
11:57 and I guess that went on for decades to
11:59 the point it's called a film school
12:00 ending when it's done right it is one of
12:02 the most masterful things and most
12:04 entertaining things to watch you know as
12:07 with all patterns people get tired and
12:09 you know you don't want one trend to
12:10 last forever but it's been a while and
12:13 the Twilight Zone has mastered had
12:16 mastered this from 59 to 65 and I think
12:22 that there's a huge connection between
12:23 the two I just personally believe that
12:25 that they know and when I hear a pitched
12:27 between people they're starting to say
12:29 depending on how old you are this is the
12:31 Twilight Zone rebooted now what's
12:34 interesting about that is that the
12:35 Twilight Zone franchise has been
12:37 attempted to be rebooted several times
12:41 when the movie was made in the mid 80s
12:44 they simply took the favorite scripts
12:47 you know he had Spielberg and John
12:49 Landau or John Landis excuse me and they
12:52 picked their scripts and they did their
12:54 thing there was this horrific accident
12:56 that happened where a helicopter flew
12:58 too low and hit a support wired and
13:00 killed two children and a main actor and
13:06 but it wasn't writing new scripts then
13:10 unbeknownst to me it's been attempted to
13:12 be rebooted a couple
13:13 and people will come to me and say well
13:15 if you heard the didn't know the charger
13:16 reboot Twilight Zone and I don't watch
13:17 TV and somebody no no I didn't hear that
13:20 and it flops so this is the first time
13:24 that I personally having been a longtime
13:27 fan of The Twilight Zone series we can
13:29 go see my episode on Twilight Zone if
13:30 you dig that series that has made it
13:34 through the other beautiful thing
13:36 besides the kind of film school ending
13:39 as they call it is black Muir has been
13:43 able to master and I mean utterly master
13:46 a one-hour format and if you see my
13:49 episode on Twilight Zone you will you
13:53 will hear about the fourth season of
13:55 Twilight Zone that could not crack the
13:59 one our formula consistently there are
14:02 wonderful episodes in the one in our
14:04 formula but if you watch all of the
14:06 episodes in the one hour format you have
14:08 to buy the DVDs or this or the blu-rays
14:11 of the discs because they're not
14:13 rentable anywhere that I know of it's
14:16 really sad because there are some
14:17 amazing episodes in that one hour format
14:21 but you'll start to feel very quickly
14:23 that they simply lengthened the
14:25 technique of filming and what do I mean
14:29 by that well if you're an astute
14:31 filmmaker you will notice that in season
14:35 one or sorry all the other seasons other
14:39 than season four when someone say runs
14:42 out of a house to get in a car in a
14:43 Twilight Zone 25-minute format they cut
14:47 they cut really fast boom boom boom you
14:50 know the show I'm getting out of the car
14:51 show assuring getting out the house and
14:53 show them opening the ocean I'm sitting
14:54 in the seat it's a fast cut sequence to
14:56 keep the action moving quickly when you
14:58 go just season four you will see them
15:01 come out of the house run down the
15:03 sidewalk come around the car unlock the
15:05 door and sit down so they really
15:07 extended the technique of filming
15:09 without really filling in the gaps which
15:11 is why back in in the final season of
15:14 Twilight Zone they went back to the
15:17 half-hour form it thank God
15:19 so there's some kudos to to Black Mirror
15:24 and absolutely mastering one hour form
15:28 you know I should note that I'm the kind
15:30 of person that I really find it super
15:34 exciting when a script never slows down
15:36 and a lot of writers pride themselves on
15:41 almost it's almost like the theory of
15:43 the five food groups you know human
15:46 beings should not eat the five food
15:47 groups necessarily you know individual
15:50 nutrition varies for individuals and you
15:52 know this idea that's one size fits all
15:54 you gotta eat this gotta eat that guy it
15:56 was just a way to sell food in America
15:58 to exacerbate the the agricultural
16:02 markets and you know it worked for a
16:04 little while so the same thing goes for
16:06 writers some writers go well it must
16:07 have it must have this and it must have
16:09 that one of the things that some of them
16:11 really adhere to is the big gap you know
16:16 where it's not the robert mckee cap I
16:18 shouldn't say gap but it's the big okay
16:22 we're just gonna sit around and talk for
16:23 a little while we're gonna sit around
16:24 and dry for a little while and it's like
16:25 if it's important to the action to
16:27 understand that someone has moved from
16:28 say sunny California to you know North
16:33 Dakota during the winter and you need to
16:34 set up the environmental shots to say
16:36 look how their world is about to change
16:39 you know we went from you know wearing
16:42 shorts all day to six-foot snowdrifts
16:45 and spun out semis and you know just
16:49 brutal pounding weather that's important
16:52 but a lot of times writers just fill up
16:56 their act too and act threes with junk
16:59 depending on if you're in a three act
17:00 play or four I played so the other Paul
17:03 Harvey to this story is that Twilight
17:05 Zone was not completely original in its
17:08 film school ending Twilight Zone and it
17:12 took me a long time to find out this
17:13 information but I finally found an
17:16 article that discussed that Rod Serling
17:19 was a fan of X minus one and if you
17:22 listened to every single episode you've
17:23 heard this a couple times but one of the
17:25 most enchanting things you can get your
17:28 hands on I found mine at archive.org in
17:31 old archived mp3s that I'd have to pay
17:34 for and I believe I have all the
17:38 episodes
17:39 x -1 itunes sells it for like a buck 99
17:43 an episode so be resourceful see if you
17:46 can't find it for free but they are
17:49 radio shows and they have an intro prior
17:52 to x -1 was a show called i think space
17:56 2000 and it's a little bit different but
18:02 x -1 was a show put on the radio here in
18:06 the united states in the mid 50's
18:07 ok i think it would about three years
18:10 from 55 to 58 but it is there are little
18:14 short stories i think they're about half
18:16 an hour piece which means 22 minutes
18:18 usually and to put ads in there are the
18:24 ones i have actually have ads in there
18:27 like squid toothpaste that you don't
18:28 hear about anymore
18:29 Lucky Strike and Pall Mall cigar
18:31 cigarettes and but they created sci-fi
18:35 sort of interesting Twilight Zone things
18:37 and some of them are about you know mice
18:39 that come alive in a mice that gain
18:42 sentient thought and a nuclear test
18:45 laboratory and there it's a funny comedy
18:47 and others have little kids that are
18:49 playing with the aliens that have
18:51 invaded earth because they want to take
18:52 over Earth and little kids are being
18:54 duped by the aliens some of them are
18:57 about sort of a Space Odyssey David
19:01 Bowie line where it's in fact they have
19:04 one that is like Major Tom going out
19:06 into space and being lost in space you
19:09 know in that whole journey so so it's
19:12 giant standing on giant standing on
19:14 giant so if you want another full
19:15 ecosystem definitely go let's go watch
19:19 every single Twilight Zone you get your
19:20 hands on no you got to buy the fourth
19:22 season if you find it out there rentable
19:25 or sorry excuse me
19:26 streamable do let me know because I
19:28 would be interested in seeing the high
19:30 quality versions the cool thing about
19:32 Netflix Twilight zones is that they are
19:34 better than my DVDs I own all 43 DVDs of
19:38 the whole series X minus 1 try to get
19:42 for free but if you dig Black Mirror
19:44 that's your lineage all right you guys
19:47 will shut up get to the program 21
19:50 minutes of blabbering
19:52 I did a whole hour on the twilight zone
19:55 because there were 180 episodes
19:58 there's only a few dozen black mirrors
20:01 so far so that's one reason why I wanted
20:03 to set this up in that particular format
20:05 all right episode one it was aired in
20:10 December 4th 2011 I'm using my phone is
20:13 a little bit of a reference here for the
20:14 dates and the names it's called the
20:16 national anthem which is very
20:19 interesting it is about a princess
20:24 Suzanne who has been kidnapped out of
20:27 the royal family this is a fictitious
20:30 royal family and a fictitious sort of
20:32 duplicate of the British Parliament and
20:35 the British royal family so they talk
20:38 about a queen or something like that but
20:40 it's not Queen Elizabeth or anything
20:42 like that
20:43 they're very careful about that kind of
20:45 thing and so this princess is captured
20:49 and the ransom note comes in to the
20:53 Prime Minister but it's also going into
20:55 the entire public I believe it goes in
20:58 as a video as well it's in every artery
21:00 of social media and it essentially says
21:02 that in order to have her released alive
21:06 and uninjured the Prime Minister must on
21:10 video have sex with a pig live in
21:16 addition to that crazy-ass request is
21:22 are the rules and the rules are there
21:27 could be no attempt to fake this using
21:30 computer graphics using a stunt double
21:33 of any kind the camera has to be
21:35 positioned in a particular angle in the
21:38 room so that there's no methodology of
21:40 faking this and then the countdown
21:44 starts at the beginning of the episode
21:47 now I say there's no spoilers in this
21:50 and it is true spoilers are typically
21:52 you know I'm going to tell you the twist
21:55 at the end or something like that I'm
21:56 not going tell you any of the endings of
21:57 any of this stuff if I accidentally say
21:59 something I will edit it out before I
22:01 release this episode
22:03 but this special okay as either to
22:07 people who have already seen black mare
22:09 and we're all kind of going through a
22:11 reminiscent you know retro appreciation
22:14 for every episode or you're not likely
22:17 to have seen it anyway and so this is to
22:19 catalyze you into going to see it so
22:23 technically speaking the setups are
22:26 sometimes just as amazing as the
22:29 conclusion so the beginnings and again
22:33 if you haven't heard of this yet this is
22:35 one reason why you got to see it the
22:38 every episode I'm going to say is so far
22:43 has a just an amazing ending so even
22:48 though this doesn't really have a
22:51 necessarily the huge Twilight Twilight
22:55 Zone ending it has a great ending and
22:57 it's really cool but it is obviously as
23:00 you can imagine very very stressful when
23:04 a slip past the first one quickly
23:05 because it doesn't have the technical
23:07 formula that all the other episodes have
23:11 episode two was aired on December 11th
23:13 2011 just a few days later meaning they
23:16 all had this they had all these episodes
23:17 in the can in 2011 and it's where you
23:22 immediately realized that someone
23:24 spending some money the first episode
23:28 was pretty much just actors in rooms and
23:32 outside of renting a few props here and
23:35 there it was pretty much just a
23:37 straightforward episode of interest rate
23:40 episode 2 is called 15 million merits
23:44 and it said in the I would say a fairly
23:50 distant future because a society has
23:53 been reduced to a almost like a matrix
23:57 formula where not that that mean wants
24:00 in a matrix but they're all pedaling
24:02 bicycles like stationary bicycles to
24:04 create electricity and power for the
24:06 rest of the world to operate on and as
24:08 they pedal they stare at these flat
24:12 screens that then you know total up the
24:15 amount of merits that they get little
24:16 credit
24:17 it's as British I think it's probably
24:19 using merits where we would say credits
24:21 it's a virtual currency and it just goes
24:23 up so as you pedal it goes up and then
24:27 their life from the moment that they
24:29 wake up to the moment they go to bed
24:31 they're spending their merits to get all
24:33 of their privileges to do everything and
24:36 for food if they want to buy an Apple if
24:38 they want to buy a drink they are having
24:41 to spend their merits and they can sit
24:45 there and pedal harder in the same
24:47 amount of time so if they had an
24:48 eight-hour shift pedaling out it's not
24:50 really clear as far as I remember how
24:52 long they actually put a little
24:53 particular day you have to assume it's
24:55 like at least an eight-hour shift you
24:57 know this one room has a row on the left
24:59 and row on the right they spend some
25:02 money on this one
25:03 they spend some money on kind of
25:06 creating this this I don't know if you
25:11 want to call it any one particular type
25:13 of like dystopian future what have you
25:15 but it it's sort of sort of like a
25:17 polished shiny tyrannical world so it's
25:20 not like Brazil where everything's dirty
25:22 and strange and used and and kind of
25:25 hand-me-down stuff and no it's all
25:26 polished beautiful shiny but the
25:28 interesting thing is that the it focuses
25:30 on this black gentleman who is the main
25:33 character and he is just he wakes up in
25:39 the morning and his room is a bunch of
25:42 televisions turned into a wall so he
25:44 took a bunch of OLEDs screens with the
25:47 bezels in between them and make kind of
25:50 a room out of that except the floor I
25:52 think is the floor it is to get up and
25:54 he goes in the bathroom and which is all
25:56 kind of a little cubicle room and he's
26:00 got to pay for his toothpaste and he's
26:03 gotta brush his teeth and he sort of
26:04 gets ready right and then he goes out to
26:07 his bicycle and we're all kind of
26:08 confused at first right and he starts
26:10 pedaling and it looks like exactly like
26:13 the Nintendo Wii the world is sort of
26:16 like all the graphics in the video game
26:19 part of the pedaling process is very
26:21 kind of low poly symbolic references but
26:25 inside his room
26:26 there's something very interesting they
26:28 start playing advertisements and shows
26:31 four things that he has to endure so
26:35 he's constantly and I mean constantly
26:37 been bought being bombarded with
26:38 advertising and one of the things you
26:41 can spend your merits on are skipping
26:44 the ads and it's all done with hand
26:47 gestures in the room so he hand gestures
26:49 and says I don't want to watch this and
26:50 it charges him a little bit of money not
26:53 a lot but the microtransactions add up
26:55 right so he's in this world he's doing
26:59 his thing and the guy next to him is
27:03 some super fat obnoxious guy who was
27:06 very written that way and he's playing
27:09 the role perfectly he was very abusive
27:11 to the staff he's very cocky and strange
27:13 and what's really funny is he's peddling
27:15 all day and he's he's overweight which
27:17 is sort of the suspension of disbelief
27:18 you have to to add to the thing everyone
27:21 would be extremely fit in this world but
27:24 they managed to bring in this kind of
27:25 Opie guy and he's just there to provide
27:27 a little contrast to how sort of calm
27:30 and collected an intelligent our main
27:31 character is right but out of thin air
27:34 this beautiful brunette comes into the
27:38 room and and they don't totally blow out
27:40 her looks or anything so she's just one
27:42 of these women it's gorgeous without any
27:44 makeup sort of thing and she starts
27:46 paddling and he starts noticing her and
27:48 and he wants to approach her and he's
27:54 shy at first and I believe it's in their
27:58 mutual unisex bathroom that he catches
28:01 her singing and he finds out she has a
28:04 wonderful voice
28:05 and he already wants to talk to her
28:08 anyway and so he manages to strike up a
28:10 conversation whereby he tells her that
28:15 she has this beautiful singing voice and
28:17 that she should go on one of the shows
28:18 that they're forced to watch and this is
28:21 where the setup starts to end here you
28:25 have to acquire 15 million credits slash
28:29 merits in order to buy a ticket to the
28:33 show that's very much like American Idol
28:34 and it's the way for you to escape
28:38 bicycling so if you can become an inner
28:40 Shaner in this world you can have your
28:43 own show and he keeps telling her to do
28:48 it and she says look it's 15 million
28:50 credits it's gonna take me forever to
28:51 get those credits and by that time you
28:53 know nothing will be interesting no one
28:54 will be interested in me and this is
28:56 where he says well my brother died and
28:59 he willed me all of his credits and I
29:03 have 15 million credits and some change
29:05 I will give you 15 million credits as a
29:09 gift and I will I will give it to you in
29:12 the form of the golden ticket to go
29:14 beyond this show and audition and if you
29:16 make it you make it if you don't you
29:17 don't and she's like no way if I don't
29:20 win that will be a complete waste of
29:22 your hard-earned you know credit from
29:26 your brother and you and of course he
29:30 does it anyway and she goes on the
29:34 audition and that's where the setup ends
29:37 and that's where you have to watch what
29:38 happens and I will tell you that it is
29:40 worth every second of your time and they
29:45 twist it two or three times after that
29:48 point in a way that I don't think you
29:50 will predict the way this works if there
29:53 was there may even be I'm almost up to
29:55 four twists technically after that point
29:57 and you might guess one maybe if you're
30:00 really astute but you'll be heavily
30:02 rewarded by the rest and what's
30:04 interesting about this actor is that he
30:07 is now starting to become I've seen him
30:12 in a bunch of movies just put that way
30:13 since 2011 and what you need to know
30:15 about Black Mirror episodes is back in
30:18 the Twilight Zone days they drew from
30:21 some of the most amazing budding talent
30:23 in Hollywood as well as some super
30:26 anchored amazing actors even from the
30:30 silent movie days there's even one
30:32 episode where they give the custom
30:34 classic actors a chance to get on TV and
30:36 really show the world how amazing they
30:38 are but most of them are sort of
30:40 aspiring actors or sorry of these some
30:45 were actually
30:46 radio voice actors that did stuff but
30:49 you don't have a bunch of superstars in
30:51 Twilight Zone
30:53 unless you're paying attention the fact
30:55 that William Shatner was in two episodes
30:57 and he became Captain Kirk right Leonard
31:00 Nimoy's and a couple episodes I believe
31:02 he's definitely in one episode but he's
31:04 in - that was just Spock and so you'll
31:07 have and Sulu with the episodes I mean
31:09 it's crazy how they found all this town
31:12 and it turned into something so black
31:13 Mir has the same thing black mayor being
31:16 a British production has I believe
31:19 there's one exception with season two
31:21 but I believe that you're talking about
31:25 almost 100% British actors until Netflix
31:28 buys it and then they start diluting in
31:31 American actors which is really nice so
31:34 the two of us working together it just
31:35 feels good you know I don't like it to
31:37 be one way you know all the way one way
31:39 or all the way the other way so you're
31:41 gonna see a lot of kind of sort of
31:44 I wouldn't say no-name actors but you'll
31:48 see actors some of their very first four
31:50 dominant roles in this and all the
31:51 episodes okay gimme episode three which
31:55 concludes season 1 is called the entire
31:57 history of you and this is where we
32:00 start getting into the overall formula
32:03 and arc of black mayor writing which is
32:06 to take a piece of technology take it to
32:09 the next level and see how dangerous
32:12 that can be
32:14 in this particular episode you have I
32:17 think they call it the bean I think
32:19 that's what they're calling it but you
32:20 put these implants in where your eyes
32:22 record everything that happens in this
32:26 infinite memory bank that's also part of
32:28 it I guess the technology and then you
32:31 have a little tiny chrome one this
32:33 little tiny beautiful like teardrop
32:35 looking thing that has a little wheel on
32:37 it like a like the wheel on an iPod way
32:40 back in the day it doesn't really turn
32:42 you just put your finger on it at any
32:45 point in time you can take your life and
32:47 pause it and dial back and see what
32:50 someone said so if you were in a
32:52 conversation and some saying oh
32:53 definitely call this person and they
32:55 said here's their phone number 1 2 3 4 5
32:56 6 7 8 9 10 and you forgot you could go
32:59 back and rewind to the conversation and
33:00 push play and
33:04 this this becomes technology that is
33:07 then introduced into the ecosystem of
33:10 black mirror and then they can reuse it
33:13 over and over in different applications
33:15 to keep storage flowing so what ends up
33:19 happening in this one this is actually a
33:20 fairly simple setup
33:21 it's imagine if you had a relationship
33:24 with someone and you could and you're
33:28 you're suspicious of cheating and you're
33:31 recording everything and you get to the
33:34 point where you know what happens
33:36 without this technology today if you're
33:38 suspecting cheating out of thin air
33:40 which most often reflects your own
33:43 personal lack of control now if you've
33:47 been bitten once then being suspicious
33:50 of future violations is is usually a
33:54 fairly sound practice but if that you
33:56 haven't if your spouse or partner hasn't
33:59 done anything to you ever and you're
34:00 just starting to synthesize absences in
34:04 contact with oh my god he or she is out
34:06 with somebody else and you started
34:08 filling in the blanks then you start to
34:11 create a real dangerous environment for
34:13 yourself and you start to build up a
34:15 skill that you really don't want to
34:17 build up which is to assume constantly
34:20 in write history to tell yourself that
34:23 you know what another person is thinking
34:25 it's really I think it's probably
34:28 something we've learned how to do
34:29 because we do write or watch excuse me a
34:32 tremendous amount of fiction I can tell
34:35 you as a writer you will start to
34:38 develop this skill because that's your
34:40 job and you need to be careful about how
34:42 you apply to your life that's where you
34:44 have to have a good grasp of reality
34:45 when this kind of thing comes around so
34:49 this episode is about a relationship
34:54 that goes south because this technology
34:55 exists and I'll just let you watch the
34:58 rest of that season 2 really continues
35:03 right were season 1 left off in terms of
35:05 getting this formula together but they
35:09 waited two years to release an episode
35:11 in season two because they were kind of
35:13 refining the formula so it wasn't until
35:17 February 11th 2013 that they came out
35:21 with the next episode and again you only
35:22 had three episodes in the first season
35:24 so season two I think what happened was
35:28 they looked at their final episode of
35:30 season one and said AHA I think this is
35:33 where were you need to go piece of
35:35 technology it's advanced to the next
35:36 level and we see how dangerous this can
35:38 be so the first episode of season 2 is
35:43 called be right back and it's about a
35:45 young couple that moves into a new
35:48 neighborhood and the husband is killed
35:53 and of course that would be utterly
35:57 traumatic to a young couple I think
36:00 they're sort of in their late 20s early
36:01 30s and after the funeral a friend of
36:06 the spouse comes up and says to the wife
36:09 and says you know hey there's this new
36:11 service out there that you can buy that
36:14 will help you keep in touch with the
36:18 deceased your husband and it's a device
36:22 and it's a it's a service where she
36:25 literally can talk to the deceased and
36:28 she begins having conversations with her
36:32 husband just like a telephone call and
36:36 what's fascinating about this particular
36:38 story is it really gets at this sort of
36:40 human condition issue of if someone does
36:46 pass away because that's the end of the
36:48 set up for that episode I'm not telling
36:50 any more about it you have to watch it
36:51 you're still a bit slow this episodes a
36:54 little slower than the other episodes
36:57 but it gets at that thing if when you
37:00 try to undo the very principles of the
37:04 universe and perhaps if you're religious
37:06 God's Way /our way you're going to find
37:13 out why it has to remain the way it is
37:16 typically right and so this for me is a
37:21 beautiful story that gets into the utter
37:26 fabric of death and you know where do
37:30 you see these kind of stories
37:31 you know you saw you know Demi Moore and
37:34 Patrick Swayze with Whoopi Goldberg
37:37 together and the movie ghost way back in
37:39 the 80s and there's a little bit of that
37:43 sort of formula of dabbling in this sort
37:45 of mezzanine of reality where the person
37:47 doesn't cleanly die and you have a ghost
37:50 and you start dealing with it this is
37:52 more technically enhanced version of
37:55 that with a just an amazing finish on
37:58 this so that's what the that one is
38:01 episode 2 of season 2 is called white
38:04 bear and this is where I think we get
38:07 into some you know to say predictive
38:10 programming is very interesting because
38:12 predictive programming is sort of the
38:14 theory that someone would show you
38:15 what's going to take place and the
38:19 theory behind it is that if I show it to
38:20 you in any form or fashion you're more
38:23 willing to accept it even if you would
38:25 normally not accept it because you've
38:28 had a little bit of time to chew on the
38:30 theory so if someone said hey the NSA is
38:34 going to start spying on you says the
38:35 military commissions Act is is signed by
38:38 George Bush jr. and Rhee signed up by
38:40 Obama you're furious your fourth
38:43 amendment is now all of a sudden you
38:45 know usurped you'd be kidding me right
38:48 these are things that can't be changed
38:49 but once they show you a couple
38:52 television shows where this is already
38:53 happening you're kind like yeah that's
38:54 what they do
38:55 I don't mind right white bear has a very
39:00 complex script it's very action-packed
39:03 but it has to do with a woman that wakes
39:07 up who is sort of suffering from amnesia
39:11 and she starts to unravel her life and
39:15 she starts to have sort of people
39:19 attacking her and the population isn't
39:23 helping they're sort of super docile and
39:27 they just observe or they don't do
39:28 anything and they walk by usually you
39:31 know it'd be an event and you know
39:32 unfortunately the world is a bit like
39:34 this right I had a story told to me a
39:37 long time ago that New York and the 70s
39:41 got so violent in neighborhoods that
39:44 whereas in the 40s and 50s someone would
39:46 run out to help if they heard someone
39:48 screaming the people that ran out to
39:50 help would typically be murdered as well
39:52 and so it by the 70s people were told to
39:57 not do anything maybe call the cops tops
39:59 right obviously but by that time most of
40:04 the damage is already done
40:06 her this woman and her friend and I want
40:10 to I should put a she should have put a
40:12 shout out to beginning this guy Charles
40:13 Brooker is the guy that invented the
40:15 series and he is one of the writers he's
40:16 a very Rod Serling kind of guy so we
40:18 need to give out huge props to this dude
40:20 but this woman and her friend started to
40:23 trying you know unravel why is this why
40:26 is there this kind of docile group of
40:30 people and how is this even happening I
40:32 mean one or two yeah you can understand
40:34 that but how is the entire population
40:36 appearing to be unable to participate in
40:41 society like a normal society and what
40:44 they discover is that there is a central
40:46 transmitter that is using the television
40:49 sets okay to keep everyone sort of again
40:54 zombified docile and there is a
40:59 tremendous amount of evidence
41:01 scientifically that you know a
41:04 television hitting you at 60 Hertz per
41:06 second you know 60 frames per second
41:08 puts you in a suggestive state of
41:11 suggestibility put you in a state of
41:14 suggestibility excuse me and it will
41:17 kind of make you zombified how many
41:20 times have you pulled your cell phone up
41:21 you're like hey I just woke up in the
41:23 morning yawn stretch and you're like let
41:24 me just see what's going on on YouTube
41:26 or see what's going on on Facebook and
41:28 you put the phone in your face and
41:30 there's somehow very quickly this level
41:33 of comfort that you wouldn't normally
41:35 have and the whole thing is like you may
41:37 actually hate Facebook you may really
41:39 not want to watch YouTube except for
41:40 deep thoughts radio and 45 minutes
41:45 passes and it seems like it was about 10
41:47 minutes at best maybe even five minutes
41:48 and you find it difficult to put the
41:51 phone down psychologically but as soon
41:54 as you do you get this kind of
41:55 liberating feeling that's
41:57 oh my god that's like I broke free from
41:59 this problem and so you know they they
42:07 attempt to get rid of the transmitter so
42:11 it's a very basic script but it is them
42:15 continuing their formula of again
42:17 technology that is getting out of hand
42:21 and again these first few episodes I
42:22 should probably going a lot faster on
42:24 them because they're they're less
42:25 interesting than the final episode of
42:28 this particular season all the other
42:30 episodes after this point episode 3 very
42:34 quickly is an episode called the Waldo
42:37 moment and the Waldo moment is about a
42:40 sort of a CG a computer-generated
42:44 character that is X positioned in public
42:47 on screens and it's voiced over by a guy
42:50 in a van so you imagine a guy in a van
42:52 and the screen on the outside I believe
42:54 they do sort of a 3d treatment in
42:56 reality like you know that technology
42:59 doesn't quite exist but the actor that
43:02 is inside the van sort of like a Max
43:04 Headroom Max Headroom was they actually
43:07 lied and said the back bedroom was CG
43:08 generator but he wasn't ever using
43:10 filters on the actor with a bunch of
43:13 rubber prosthetics on his face to make
43:14 him look like he was generated by 3d
43:17 this particular one is a 3d character
43:20 and it's sort of this weird animated
43:23 character blue-faced kind of angry
43:26 little round creature and this
43:29 politician is out doing a campaign stop
43:31 in public and here comes the van and the
43:34 guy just takes a pot shot at the
43:35 politician you know saying he's a career
43:39 politician he's a bad guy and you
43:41 shouldn't vote for this dude and then it
43:43 evolved to the point where Waldo the
43:46 fictional character is now running for
43:48 office and saying just mocking the
43:50 politicians and saying you should run
43:52 for me because at least I have more
43:53 integrity you know I'm a cartoon
43:55 character you know I'm artificial and it
43:58 gets out of hand where the guy starts
44:01 winning the election and so the the
44:06 twists at the end are all about this
44:09 this sort of irony that you do have
44:13 until you know until the Donald Trump
44:16 character who is not part of a secret
44:18 society was actually been writing books
44:20 his whole life and making television
44:21 shows about how to be successful and
44:23 bring back the American dream until then
44:26 you had your Nancy Pelosi's your Chuck
44:28 Schumer's who are career politicians
44:30 raised by political families you know
44:33 they've only made like what does a Nancy
44:35 Pelosi has only earned maybe six million
44:37 dollars in salary from the United States
44:39 government in her entire term but she's
44:41 worth almost two hundred million dollars
44:44 because she's taken so many kickbacks
44:45 and she's from a rich family to begin
44:47 with so the finale is how this all
44:49 unwraps and this is less twisty but
44:53 still kind of the irony of today
44:56 now this is where this show starts to
45:00 have teeth
45:01 the this episode I believe in America on
45:05 Netflix was aired as the I don't know if
45:08 it was actually aired as a season two
45:10 finale I remember being on Netflix as a
45:13 season one intro and then being pulled
45:16 back and put into season two because
45:18 season three had its own rehash
45:22 re-engineering of the entire show to
45:24 really smooth out all of the formulas
45:26 and stuff so if you're gonna recommend
45:29 net sorry Black Mirror to someone on
45:33 Netflix I always tell people start at
45:36 this particular episode it's the fourth
45:38 episode of season two and it is called
45:41 white Christmas and it is a three-part I
45:46 think it's an hour and a half episode
45:48 every half-hour has a new story to it
45:51 and it is one of the most brilliant
45:54 freaking episodes this could have been a
45:56 movie all by itself but if you're a
45:59 black mirror fan you start to see this
46:01 technology start to pile up in terms of
46:04 wow this is sort of what there's this
46:06 there's this bizarre invisible bar that
46:09 is set where technology has kind of
46:12 gotten to this level okay those of you
46:16 who like Mad Men Jon Hamm hae mm he
46:21 plays a character
46:22 met and he is the central character one
46:26 of the central characters in here the
46:29 other dude his name is Rafe spall re fe
46:32 s PA ll very strange name he plays a guy
46:35 named Joe Potter in the episode and the
46:38 season starts out I'm sorry this episode
46:40 starts out where they're sort of in kind
46:41 of a cabin and the backstory in the
46:45 conversation very quickly is that
46:47 they're mutually working somewhere in
46:49 some factory or whatever and they're
46:51 they kind of have a day off because it's
46:53 Christmas and so this the the two of
46:55 them haven't talked for you know most of
46:59 the time that they've been together in
47:00 this particular cabin and this is the
47:02 day that jon Hamm's character sort of
47:05 breaks the ice and starts making a
47:07 Christmas dinner so you know pots and
47:11 pans are banging around early morning
47:13 the guy the other dude comes out rapes
47:16 character Joe you know and he's kind of
47:19 a introvert you can tell he doesn't
47:21 really like the other guy you could tell
47:24 the Jones character Matt and but this
47:28 guy is like Matt's this dude who really
47:30 breaks the ice you know he he's just
47:34 really good with people and so he starts
47:36 to just break this guy down a little bit
47:37 and goes come on man it's Christmas you
47:39 know what have you said a couple words
47:41 to me in the whole month we've been
47:42 together here
47:43 you need to just you know let's use this
47:45 day to get to know each other and it's
47:46 very endearing and very cool now what
47:50 ends up happening in the conversation is
47:52 the formula of this particular episode
47:54 is utterly brilliant in that I believe
47:57 jon Hamm's character shares two stories
48:01 about himself and then the Rafe
48:04 character map or sir me Joe
48:07 sure has one about himself and so for
48:12 any of you who've ever seen the
48:13 illustrated man way back in the late
48:15 sixties early seventies Cameron was made
48:17 it was using Ray Bradbury stories and
48:21 this guy with an illustrative body to
48:25 hobos traveling across to America and
48:29 across America and when he looks into
48:33 these dudes tattoos this whole big guy
48:36 the big guy looks back and misses you
48:38 know you better be careful looking into
48:39 my tattoos cuz they're all stories put
48:41 on me by this amazing sort of gypsy
48:44 woman who gave me these tattoos they're
48:46 not normal tattoos man and so he looks
48:49 into these tattoos and he gets you know
48:51 story after story summer sci-fi some of
48:53 them are just McCobb weird stories this
48:57 does sort of a treatment to that where
48:59 you get these three individual stories
49:01 and so the very first sub story that's
49:05 in here is the guy said you know because
49:08 it comes down to the point where you
49:10 know we're not perfect and so don't
49:13 worry about hiding your life from me man
49:14 I'm not perfect either and so he gives
49:17 up a story where he used to do a
49:19 consulting service where because of
49:21 these eye implants that you have from
49:24 season one they were able to he was able
49:28 to create a dating service where he
49:30 would help sort of gentleman without a
49:34 lot of self-confidence right he would
49:38 look out their eyes and he's at a whole
49:40 command center in his apartment and he
49:43 was able to help this kid say the right
49:46 things do the right things navigate a
49:48 party find the hottest girl strike up a
49:51 conversation with her and take her home
49:53 but there is a huge twist at the end of
49:57 that particular episode so everything
49:58 goes really brilliant and you're just
50:01 kind of reveling in this technology like
50:03 that would be really cool you know if
50:04 you you were nervous about going to a
50:07 big party and you had someone sort of in
50:09 the back of your head telling you
50:11 everything to say and if you look at
50:12 someone's face and you don't know who
50:14 they are this future world has a you
50:17 know a face recognition system software
50:18 this guy would find out where that guy
50:20 was in the company oh yeah that's the
50:21 CEO say hello to him his name is you
50:24 know John Doe and so you always look
50:26 like you got your craft together as you
50:28 walk around the room unbeknownst to
50:30 anyone else right the second story
50:33 debuts a brand new technology that is
50:36 then reused in future episodes which is
50:38 and he talks about having a service
50:42 where there is a really rich people
50:47 would have this little
50:49 pod put inside their temple for a few
50:51 days or whatever and you just live your
50:53 life and then you pull the thing out and
50:56 it's this little little rice bean thing
50:59 and you put it inside this little
51:00 capsule ated egg thing and you have a
51:03 duplicate of yourself inside this egg
51:05 and then the egg is taken to your house
51:08 and it is taught to take care of all
51:10 your needs in the home because it is a
51:13 duplicate of you it knows what how you
51:15 want your food created when you like to
51:17 get up it knows your relationships with
51:20 friends and as it accrues new
51:22 information its you so it has the
51:24 predisposition to to do everything that
51:26 you would want it to do and of course
51:30 the the twist that we can set up set up
51:35 this particular sub story with is that
51:38 the AI version doesn't at first it never
51:41 has a it never understands that it's an
51:44 AI at first it it thinks it's you and so
51:48 it gets angry at the idea being in a
51:51 prison handling you know the making of
51:54 toast and so there's a lot of resistance
51:56 and arguing and his service this initial
52:00 Jon Hamm character is to teach the AI
52:03 copy of you inside this little egg to
52:06 behave and accept it and enjoy it and so
52:10 that's the second story he tells in the
52:12 surface and of course there's twists
52:16 about how that whole thing pans out and
52:18 then when it finally gets to the other
52:20 dude he talks about a the reason why
52:25 he's there and the reason why I kind of
52:26 retreated from society to this remote
52:28 location to work and he describes a an
52:33 engagement that he had and I believe may
52:36 he may have even been married he's with
52:39 his wife and they are hanging out and he
52:42 is sort of that sadly going through that
52:45 stage that a lot of young men go through
52:47 where they get super confident with
52:50 their world and they really start to
52:52 lose the accountability to their spouse
52:54 they they get flip 'add and they think
52:57 oh there's no way she's gonna leave me
52:59 kind of behavior and eventually she
53:02 doesn't necessary
53:02 leave him run away but he gets the point
53:04 ease obnoxious and embarrassing in
53:07 public they go karaoking and he's an
53:10 alcoholic and so he's just really
53:12 obnoxious and they get home and he finds
53:20 in the trash bin a pregnancy test and
53:23 finds out that she's pregnant and of
53:25 course he's very happy that she's
53:27 pregnant but they he realizes that night
53:30 that she did this pregnancy test earlier
53:33 the day but she's been out drinking and
53:35 so he comes into her knees like hey
53:37 sweetheart you know I found this and
53:39 this is amazing why didn't you tell me
53:41 I'm so happy we're gonna live a lot
53:42 we're gonna have a beautiful life
53:43 together and make beautiful kids
53:44 together and she's not having it and
53:46 she's not having it because he's a drunk
53:50 you know and he's embarrassing and of
53:54 course he says well if you knew this
53:56 when why were you drinking today and
53:58 she's like because I'm not gonna have
53:59 this kid and he's like well come on
54:00 that's pretty selfish you haven't even
54:02 told me and she goes well it's not your
54:04 choice and he's like he gets angry he's
54:06 like it is my choice you know partly my
54:08 choice partly your choice let's talk
54:10 about this you know if you have any
54:11 reservations let's talk if I'm doing
54:13 something wrong I'll fix it and she's
54:15 like I don't want to do this and so he
54:16 gets really angry because he's that kind
54:19 of guy
54:20 any freaks her out and then you have
54:23 this new technology that's debuted in
54:25 the episode which is that you have this
54:26 ability to visually block someone
54:29 because everyone has these implant eyes
54:31 from previous episodes you can block and
54:35 then when you look at the other person
54:36 it's a it's been literally trace like
54:39 rotoscope doubt and you see this gray
54:41 blur and their voice is muffled and so
54:44 what's happening is he can't see her and
54:47 she can't see him but they can hear she
54:50 can hear him yelling kind of on a
54:52 mumbling nature and she can see him
54:53 moving around the room in an outline but
54:55 she can't communicate and of course he's
54:58 very furious that she has taken this
55:00 cowardly way out of the conversation
55:03 they're having so he I think he throws a
55:05 plant against the law and breaks it and
55:07 of course then she's like super freaked
55:09 out because he's going violent on her
55:10 and of course she gets in the car she
55:14 leaves he doesn't touch her of course he
55:15 hasn't beat her up or anything
55:16 but then he's trying to run after her in
55:18 the car neighbors are watching and he
55:21 loses contact with his wife and I think
55:25 they're married I'm pretty sure they're
55:26 right and so it's this horrible story
55:30 where he's trying to get communication
55:32 with his wife again and in his brain
55:34 she's pregnant so he's like what's going
55:38 on
55:38 the only other thing I'll tell you it's
55:40 not a giant spoiler it's a set up is
55:42 that he finds out that she actually had
55:44 the child and so he now knows you know
55:47 in his brain he's got a kid and so he's
55:49 trying to not lose sight and the block
55:52 carries down to the child too so he
55:54 can't see his child so then it all
55:56 resulted there's a amazing resolution to
55:59 that and then what they do is they take
56:01 another story line and they wrap all
56:03 three of them around another story line
56:06 that mega twists at the end okay on to
56:09 season three hopefully it's not like a
56:11 ten hour episode here
56:13 this one's called nosedive and this is
56:15 absolutely a massive predictive
56:18 programming thing that's based on some
56:21 something that's actually going to be I
56:23 think mandatory in 2020 in China this is
56:27 an episode where they take up an
56:28 application instead of just basic raw
56:31 hardware technology and it is about a
56:34 futuristic kind of near future world and
56:37 again for China it's supposed to be
56:39 mandatory in 2020 where society is using
56:44 an application to rate each other's
56:46 behaviors and you will have seen an
56:48 episode of Orville take this on as well
56:51 and again this is I think the most
56:52 predictive programming thing I've seen
56:55 on the show and it could be that the
56:56 show is usurped
56:57 to put out these predictive programming
57:00 things and again the whole point of this
57:02 is to get society warmed up to something
57:05 that they would otherwise not accept and
57:07 so the way it works is that if you're
57:11 out in public and you're driving your
57:13 car or you are in some merchants
57:17 relationship where you're trying to buy
57:18 a coffee or something like that and
57:19 you're either kind to the person in
57:22 front of you or not kind they can reach
57:25 you on this app a plus or minus based on
57:28 the amount of pluses you get a higher
57:29 score
57:30 based on the minuses you go down and
57:32 this app already exists in China as a
57:36 sort of a fun social media app and the
57:38 word on the street is that it's being
57:40 made mandatory in 2020 and what this
57:44 controls is one your relationship with
57:50 other people no one wants to be friends
57:51 with a low scoring person because it
57:53 brings your score down you want to to be
57:56 in a world where you're really popular
57:58 so it's sort of like TMZ turned into an
58:00 application right the frivolous stuff
58:02 and world is also included with things
58:04 that would be normal things so you know
58:07 at first you hear this and you're like
58:09 oh my gosh that sounds fantastic you
58:11 know we would get all these jerks to be
58:12 rated way down and all the good people
58:15 to be rated up the only problem is is
58:17 this extends into propaganda so if you
58:20 were to question 9/11 for instance you
58:22 might get a really low count because no
58:25 one wants to research the truth right
58:27 but if you're going to go along with we
58:29 landed on the moon you get a tremendous
58:31 push so if you are so this episode is
58:35 about a woman who is just your average
58:37 female living a life who happens to have
58:40 a celebrity friend and she is trying to
58:44 get her count as high as possible but
58:46 she has control issues right she won't
58:49 she kind of pops her top a little easier
58:52 than most people and so she ends up
58:55 getting invited to a wedding of a very
58:59 famous person who has suddenly liked her
59:02 connected with her on the app so she's
59:04 had this huge boost in popularity which
59:07 she's so ecstatic about so the setup is
59:10 is that she is trying to get to this
59:12 wedding and everything is going wrong
59:14 her flight goes wrong her rental car
59:16 goes wrong and as everything starts to
59:18 tumble her interactions with humans
59:20 starts to get really testy and strange
59:23 and she starts going down and down and
59:24 down now to add matters to this formula
59:29 what you do might get recorded on video
59:32 and then your identity goes out with a
59:35 Youtube viral video that you're a
59:36 complete jerk and that all sudden the
59:38 world starts voting you down or starts
59:41 voting you up so it's
59:44 it's a very testy situation and it ends
59:47 incredibly but it's there to warn you
59:49 about this technology coming out but it
59:53 also kind of predictively programs you
59:55 into accepting it it's definitely more
59:57 of a chick flick Netflix which is very
60:00 important for us guys that want the
60:01 girls to watch some of the more McCobb
60:03 dark episodes because they feel like
60:06 there's something going to come up for
60:07 them at some point so I've had friends
60:09 jump into season 3 episode 1 and kind of
60:13 get put off by the Legally Blonde sort
60:15 of style of this particular episode I
60:18 think that would be an unfair
60:20 characterization of the overall story so
60:22 definitely have a look now episode 2
60:26 season 3 is probably so far my ultra
60:29 favorite episode of the entire series
60:31 and it stars Kurt Russell's son and it
60:34 is about a gentleman who is sneaking out
60:37 of his house early one morning with this
60:39 backpack is passport and some money and
60:41 he is about to hop on a plane and tour
60:47 the entire world and so the setup is
60:48 that we see him going all around the
60:51 world Taj Mahal he goes to all these
60:55 Asian countries Middle Eastern countries
60:57 and ends up in England and I had never
61:00 seen him act before but let me tell you
61:02 if there ever was an Emmy for a little
61:05 tiny one-hour show this dude would get
61:08 it his name is Wyatt Russell which
61:12 knowing Kurt Russell he probably named
61:14 him after Wyatt Earp which is pretty
61:15 cool but what happens is he ends up in
61:19 England and he's his last leg of his
61:21 tour he's about to go home and there's
61:23 some weird thing with his mother his
61:25 mother keeps phoning his cellphone and
61:26 he keeps not answering it and we know
61:29 there's some tension between them and as
61:30 he snuck out we can only assume that he
61:32 didn't want to tell his mom that he was
61:34 leaving so we have some tension between
61:37 them some issue he's sitting in a cafe
61:40 in England and he's noticing a couple
61:42 kissing and he's like you know what I've
61:44 been on this whole trip I haven't had
61:45 any companionship let's get a nap
61:48 together a little dating app and they've
61:50 invented these dating apps in the show
61:52 you'll see them from time to time used
61:54 and he uses it picks out a girl meets
61:57 her
61:57 in pub as a great conversation with her
62:00 she's really playful and he's really
62:02 playful and so they end up hooking up
62:05 that night and the next morning they
62:08 wake up and they're continuing to kind
62:10 of learn about each other and what you
62:12 learn is that his father has passed away
62:14 due to Alzheimer's and the troubling
62:18 thing for him was that his his father
62:20 was his best friend he never really made
62:22 a huge connection with his mother and
62:23 now his mom is sort of out of sorts
62:27 because the father died and so he is
62:29 sort of avoiding this relationship with
62:32 his mom because he doesn't really know
62:33 her and they've never been close and I
62:35 guess you know it's just one of those
62:37 kind of stories so they do their thing
62:40 and he's now the next morning that
62:42 afternoon she goes to work he's just
62:43 trying to buy a plane ticket to go home
62:45 and he finds out that his credit cards
62:46 have been lifted you know someone has
62:49 cloned his card and spent all of his
62:51 money and he does have any money and
62:52 it's going to take at least a week for
62:55 the money to be refunded back into his
62:57 account so he can buy a plane ticket so
62:58 now he's kind of screwed so he contacts
63:01 the girl again and he says look you know
63:02 I got this problem it's all off camera
63:04 sort of stuff and she's really cute
63:06 about it and she says you know this is
63:07 got to be the lamest excuse for a second
63:11 hookup I've ever heard and he's like yes
63:12 you know you you you trusted me this is
63:14 awesome and he goes one of the funniest
63:16 lines at the beginning is he is you are
63:19 a top bird he goes I don't know what
63:20 that is but you're one of them and so
63:23 they go in and have a nice dinner
63:24 together and they're sitting on the sofa
63:26 and now he's got to earn a little bit of
63:28 money to buy the plane ticket faster
63:30 than this refund is gonna happen so he
63:31 brings up a second app that is sort of a
63:33 find a job app which violates all the
63:35 visas of foreign countries but he was
63:39 like an odd job app and I've actually
63:40 watched Border Patrol episodes on
63:42 Netflix that actually this app exists
63:45 it's pretty funny so they're just kind
63:47 of messing around he passes her the
63:49 phone and she finds a video game company
63:50 run by this Japanese guy that they've
63:53 basically bought this manor house this
63:55 big sorry kind of a small little mansion
63:57 to run their company out of and it has
64:00 like a bunch of dollar signs in the app
64:02 so he's gonna make a tremendous amount
64:03 of money and all he has to do is is play
64:06 test a game and he's gonna make money
64:09 and so he
64:11 goes to the facility and it's this
64:14 beautiful place all these employees
64:16 they're all stay d'art technology
64:18 they've got the little the little things
64:20 on a temple that you will have seen in
64:22 other episodes and they're not they'd
64:23 already monitor in front of them but
64:25 they seem to be typing on keyboards and
64:26 looking at something and he's kind of
64:28 like did they see the monitor you know
64:30 and she's not really getting a lot of
64:31 answers it kinda looks like Dumbledore
64:34 fin side and she takes him up to this
64:37 sort of beautiful white super clean
64:40 level of the mansion and they go into
64:43 this room and she says you know I need
64:45 your cell phone any other electronic
64:46 equipment you have because anything can
64:49 take photographs and stuff and he kind
64:50 of ribs her for being paranoid and they
64:53 go inside this room and she he has to
64:57 fill an NDA and then they start this
65:00 session where he's going to get this
65:01 little mushroom this little tiny button
65:04 put in the back of his neck that's going
65:07 to feed him the images and they have to
65:10 use this they put him in a chair once
65:11 they put this little mushroom in the
65:13 back of his neck and they have this
65:14 little bar that goes over his temple
65:16 where they used between the mushroom and
65:18 this bar they they inlay the software
65:21 that's going to make this experiment
65:23 take place and then she puts these AR
65:26 our minted reality circular patterns on
65:29 the table and runs this little game
65:32 which is a little whack-a-mole game and
65:34 so those patterns disappear and turn
65:36 into holes this little gopher comes out
65:37 first he's low-poly she does a couple
65:40 little upgrades and he becomes
65:41 photo-real he's freaking out he's like
65:42 oh my god this thing is so real and she
65:45 says look hit him just hit him yeah hit
65:48 him with your hand so it's like
65:49 whack-a-mole so he starts playing the
65:51 game it's over just as fast as it starts
65:54 he is blown away and she goes I think
65:56 you should go for the real experience
65:58 and he's like I'm game I'm game this is
66:02 awesome and so she takes them in to meet
66:04 the founder who's this Japanese
66:05 gentleman which is very traditional of
66:08 the big Nintendo and Sony inventors they
66:11 are there are these personalities out
66:13 there that make Metal Gear Solid what
66:14 have you and so they say the next part
66:18 of the game is that we have this upgrade
66:20 to your mushroom so they give them a new
66:22 program and they said they'd take them
66:25 out
66:25 this manor house kind of a look at a
66:27 haunted mansion that has been actually
66:29 used in one of the video games they've
66:31 scanned it and made it a part of a
66:33 previous game and he's like oh my god
66:34 this is the house she goes yeah we
66:36 scanned this and we put it in the last
66:38 game he's like this is awesome you know
66:40 so they get in there and it's like a
66:42 spooky old house and she says okay
66:45 here's the deal
66:45 you're just going to spend the night
66:48 here that's all you gonna do and
66:49 everything that you see is just in your
66:51 head nothing can touch you nothing can
66:53 harm you and the only thing we need to
66:56 establish is a safe word and he goes
66:59 what are you talking about she goes well
67:00 it no word that if you get too freaked
67:02 out you can tell me and I'll pull you
67:04 out of this simulation he's like really
67:06 you know he's like okay
67:07 why don't we just use the word stop and
67:09 she goes fine she goes here's an
67:11 earpiece put this in your ear so I'll
67:13 talk to you while you're in here and so
67:16 the setup is that he's in this house and
67:19 all he has to do is survive until
67:21 morning and a bunch of amazing things
67:26 take place and so that's the setup I
67:29 will tell you that I can't tell you
67:34 exactly what I mean by this next
67:36 statement but once you have finished the
67:38 episode re-watch it and re-watch it
67:41 until you get what actually happened in
67:44 this particular episode you will think
67:45 you've seen the whole show when it's
67:46 over but I surprise my friends all the
67:49 time with this episode I have seen this
67:51 episode no less than five times probably
67:54 a couple times more it is entertaining
67:57 from start to finish again Wyatt Russell
67:59 is one of the best actors out there I
68:01 think in Hollywood and I am eager to see
68:04 him do plenty more so that's a personal
68:09 favorite of mine the next episode is
68:13 episode three of season three and it's
68:16 called shut up and dance and the the
68:20 title is very misleading as to what's
68:22 about to occur here but the setup is
68:24 very simple and I'm just gonna give you
68:27 a really quick brief on this a young man
68:30 in his home with his sister in the other
68:34 room and the parents were kind of in and
68:36 out of the place it's pretty much just
68:37 lives with his mom
68:39 he does what many boys do and he goes up
68:43 to his computer at one point in the
68:44 night with his laptop and he watches
68:47 pornographic material and masturbates in
68:50 front of his computer and of course all
68:52 computers have NSA cameras installed in
68:54 them and so he is recorded at the
68:58 beginning of the episode he finds out
69:01 that his sisters actually taken his
69:02 computer out of his room and she has
69:04 been messing around on it getting it all
69:05 infected with a bunch of viruses and so
69:07 when he does this little ritual he finds
69:10 out that his sisters actually gotten the
69:12 software on there and someone
69:14 immediately pops on a computer and
69:16 starts blackmailing him and the way that
69:20 it works is that they create this chain
69:23 of events that he must do that you have
69:25 to go here and do this otherwise we're
69:26 gonna release this video and of course
69:27 he's young so he believes that the
69:29 damage of masturbating is going to be
69:32 horrific for his mother to see and
69:35 everyone so he goes along with it and he
69:37 finds out that he starts bumping into
69:39 other people who have been blackmailed
69:40 and if any of you have read the book
69:43 needful things by Stephen King which is
69:46 about the devil opening a pawn shop in a
69:48 in a little town and he has things that
69:51 are magical that you're you wouldn't
69:54 normally be able to get from your
69:55 childhood so he charges everyone a bunch
69:57 of money or he has them do little deeds
70:00 we started charges them no money and has
70:02 them do deeds to get this item and he's
70:03 creating havoc in the town because you
70:06 don't understand that when you do a
70:07 little thing it totally exacerbates the
70:09 situation you're unaware of
70:10 so everyone plays a part in this
70:15 blackmailing game and so it's a since
70:17 estable thing a lot of new people get
70:21 introduced the things that they have to
70:23 do get more and more outrageous and
70:25 intense and then there are super duper
70:28 twists at the end of this episode so
70:30 this is a fairly dark one but it starts
70:33 to make you think about how much you
70:36 would do in front of a camera your cell
70:38 phone your laptop your TV your video
70:40 game system with these cameras because
70:42 if anybody really did wanna blackmail
70:44 you blackmailing is always relative to
70:48 your perspective of yourself and the
70:49 persona that you want people to know
70:51 about you if you're committing
70:52 prime's it's a whole different thing
70:54 right but you know if you're cheated on
70:56 your wife or something like that you
70:59 know if someone said oh hey a guy
71:00 cheated on his wife and his wife found
71:01 out she divorced him you might go yeah
71:03 whatever but to you the person who may
71:05 have engaged in such a thing it's the
71:08 end of the world and so you would never
71:10 want to lose your wife and you get
71:11 actually lose access to your children
71:12 you become a douche to all the family
71:14 members so they they do they use
71:17 everything that you could possibly use
71:19 to get the motivation going in this
71:20 episode it's really tremendous so
71:23 episode four is called San juniper
71:26 juniperus and this is a very a very
71:35 complex episode when I watched it first
71:38 I was sort of like what the hell is
71:39 going on here and then it turned out to
71:42 be a really touching episode at the end
71:45 this is a chick flick one so if you have
71:47 a girlfriend that wants to see black
71:49 mirror or she doesn't want to see the
71:50 one that's really dark get it over to
71:52 San Junipero which is actually a
71:55 location or people go and I'm trying to
72:01 figure out a way to set this up that
72:03 won't completely ruin it for you but
72:04 what you find out is that there are this
72:07 is again a future near future technology
72:10 whereby people seem to be virtually
72:12 living in this matrix on purpose and
72:14 they go into this matrix and they visit
72:17 each other like an MMO video game but
72:19 it's obviously photo real this is this
72:21 is real as this world and a girl goes
72:26 into the game that is I guess it's a
72:28 game but it's it's a place and she is
72:30 sort of an awkward nerdy girl and she
72:33 ends up bouncing through this 80's club
72:35 they do an amazing job creating an 80s
72:37 Club in this particular episode but she
72:40 meets another girl and a guy but she
72:42 ends up really forming a strong
72:45 relationship with this black girl and
72:47 the black girls like this really
72:49 outrageous girl she's been there for a
72:51 long time she knows it like the back of
72:53 her hand but they keep making these
72:55 references to sort of circumstances that
72:58 aren't going on in the room and it just
73:02 kind of goes in one ear out the other
73:04 and people are kind of going oh okay
73:05 okay
73:06 like they understand these phrases that
73:07 you don't understand the the setup that
73:10 you should probably hear because if you
73:12 don't hear this you may not continue
73:14 watching the episode I watched it
73:16 because I had a profound respect for the
73:17 show but it was still tough getting to
73:19 the point I was like oh that's what's
73:21 going on and this won't ruin the finale
73:23 at all what you find out is that these
73:28 women in the real world and probably the
73:30 guys but we don't see any the guys back
73:31 stories is that they are actually in
73:34 assisted living homes and varying levels
73:38 of hospice so they are sort of
73:40 terminally diagnosed with whatever
73:43 particular illness that they have you
73:45 know some people could be a day away
73:46 from passing away some people could be
73:49 you know they don't know they could be
73:52 living in two or three years but they
73:53 still need you know 24-hour care so most
73:56 of them are incapacitated in bed some
73:59 aren't some can travel but it's very
74:01 stressful for them so you find out that
74:03 both these women have varying conditions
74:07 and it turns out that the black girl in
74:10 real life has a little bit more built mo
74:14 more mobility than the other girl and so
74:16 they make this pact while they're
74:17 visiting this world I'm gonna come see
74:20 you in the real world and so they
74:22 exchange information and that's really
74:24 where the story starts and so just know
74:27 that that's the setup that's what's
74:29 going on when you hear the weird phrases
74:31 at the beginning episode now you'll
74:32 understand it and it really begs to the
74:35 the risky formula of these writers which
74:38 I think I'm glad they took this risk is
74:40 that you really want to watch some of
74:41 these episodes twice if not again like
74:44 play test you need to see it three or
74:46 four times until you figure out what
74:48 really was going on the entire episode
74:50 I've I have friends that have seen it
74:54 and and they're not the kind of people
74:56 that watch things twice and so I will I
74:58 will
74:59 remind them I'll ask them questions
75:01 they'll say what did you see what did
75:02 you see what you see and then eventually
75:03 they go oh yeah oh my god it's more
75:06 amazing than I ever thought so this is
75:08 one that will I will save you the repeat
75:09 watch because there isn't a lot of value
75:11 to sing this one twice the fifth episode
75:14 of season 3 is called men against fire
75:16 and I've mentioned this episode
75:19 in the past I won't put a lot of pointer
75:21 because I revealed a little bit more in
75:23 my quick reference I revealed it in a
75:26 way that out of context you wouldn't
75:28 have it wouldn't be a spoiler but now
75:30 since we're on and I'm not going to go
75:31 as far as I went in a previous mention
75:32 of this episode but this is a again near
75:35 future time table where they have taken
75:38 the soldiers of the world and implanted
75:41 them with some artificial intelligence
75:42 that puts up a heads-up display so that
75:46 when they're in battle they can see a
75:47 lot of data that they would normally see
75:50 it's focused on a black gentleman who's
75:53 the soldier it's he's a British
75:55 character he does a great job and
75:56 there's a few famous actors in this that
75:59 you'll see from house of cards at least
76:01 one guy from house of cards is one of
76:03 the best actors and house of cards and
76:05 at least season one and two and there is
76:11 this plague on the world where they have
76:14 these I believe they call them like
76:16 cockroaches but they're sort of like
76:18 these weird zombie they're not quite
76:21 zombies as in the traditional sense of a
76:22 zombie they're kind of weird again they
76:25 look a bit like a rat and a human being
76:27 mixed together and these the world is
76:29 terrified of this this weird infestation
76:33 of these humanoids that seem to have
76:34 transformed somehow and so our main
76:37 character is a new soldier getting into
76:40 the enforcement of going out and finding
76:42 these nests of people and they're like
76:45 they'll be hiding in the Attic they'll
76:46 be they'll have taken over a building
76:48 and he's of course a gung-ho soldier but
76:53 something happens to him in the middle
76:54 of one of these invasions that are one
76:58 of these you know clearings of these
77:01 these rats or cockroaches wherever they
77:04 call them and he is approached by one of
77:09 these things with that like a almost
77:11 like a Doctor Who wand it was like a pin
77:13 with a bunch of science stuff on the end
77:14 with a little LED on the end and starts
77:16 to point this at his head and you know
77:18 right off the bat you're kind of
77:20 confused just you're kind of going these
77:21 things are really primitive weird kind
77:23 of feral creatures and Nelson they have
77:24 this technology in their hand and it
77:27 sort of messes up his brain he ends up
77:28 killing this thing that was doing it to
77:31 him because that's his job and
77:32 when he goes back into his normal life
77:34 he's not the same anymore his training
77:37 gets interrupted by these weird
77:39 screeching you know visions that hurts
77:41 his head it gives him a headache and
77:42 he's trying to figure it out and when he
77:44 starts figuring out is when this episode
77:46 starts to unravel and it will it's a
77:49 cautionary tale about trusting your
77:52 military to put artificial intelligence
77:55 in your brain that's all I'll say but it
77:58 is a fantastic episode very high-impact
78:01 crazy
78:02 the final episode six of season three is
78:05 called hated in the nation and it
78:07 features a Irish actress that was part
78:10 of Steve Buscemi episodes on HBO for
78:15 Boardwalk Empire but she plays a
78:17 character that is a crime investigator
78:20 for this mysterious string of deaths
78:24 that have been going on you know a lot
78:27 of you know that the bees of the world
78:29 have been struggling for their
78:30 population in the world and I am talking
78:32 about the insect the honeybee which is
78:35 an extremely important part of an
78:37 agriculture of the world it has been
78:39 said that if the bees of the world die
78:40 if we're unable to find a solution for
78:43 what they do
78:44 mankind might perish in a couple years
78:47 because we couldn't pollinate plants you
78:49 know the the bee lands on one plant and
78:52 carries the fertilizing pollen to
78:54 another plant and that's how they
78:56 procreate
78:56 so without something doing that playing
78:58 that role and there is nothing else that
79:00 plays that role on the regimented level
79:02 the bees do we would pass out we would
79:04 die to pass away so they find that these
79:10 people who have been killed so there's
79:15 this random string of deaths is that
79:17 they are they have suffered a sling and
79:20 an arrow on social media and this is the
79:23 what our main character figures out this
79:24 is the setup she finds out that the
79:27 hashtags of the world are starting to
79:30 correspond with the death so you have
79:33 like a rapper who made a racial
79:35 statement on a talk show and it trended
79:38 the tag trended against him and they
79:40 found that people were putting a hashtag
79:42 to kill the guy and all of a sudden he
79:44 dies and he dies in a really
79:46 serious ways not attacked by anyone and
79:49 they end up doing autopsies on some of
79:52 the bodies and what they find out is
79:54 that in this futuristic world the bees
79:57 have been largely wiped out and in order
80:01 to save the world these scientists
80:03 invented these nano sized bees that
80:05 actually little robots and they do what
80:07 bees do they build these beautiful
80:08 almost architectural beehives they look
80:12 like little apartment complexes they
80:14 self replicate they self repair and they
80:16 fly all over the world it's an
80:17 experiment that's going on in England in
80:19 this particular episode and one of the
80:22 little bees has been taken over to
80:24 burrow into the head of a human being
80:26 and explode or at least kill them right
80:30 so when they do the autopsies you keep
80:32 finding you know little carcasses of
80:33 these bees and like oh my god someone is
80:35 using these bees to kill people and so
80:37 they go to the facility where the bees
80:39 are being controlled and being created
80:41 and the of course the lead scientists
80:44 has nothing to do with that he's like
80:45 man I don't know what the hell's going
80:47 on this should be impossible once the
80:49 bees programming is interrupted the
80:52 software inside forbids any further
80:55 operation they should you know elect
80:57 themselves to die and get replaced and
80:59 then it should report that malfunction
81:01 to us and we should be able to repair it
81:02 so if this is truly happening then
81:06 someone is hacking into these bees and
81:09 so that's where the story starts for you
81:13 and it has twist after twist after twist
81:15 I have to apologize my neighbor's doing
81:18 a little bit of woodwork in the front of
81:19 his house Season 4 episode 1 it's called
81:23 the USS Callister another ultra
81:25 brilliant episode that has to do with
81:28 massive multiplayer online games sort of
81:32 being mixed with the movie Tron and so
81:35 what you find out it starts off with
81:37 this sort of Star Trek II episode where
81:41 the it's it's Star Trek it's a it's a
81:46 different universe on the USS Callister
81:48 but this kind of nerdy guy comes in and
81:52 it starts commanding this scenario is
81:53 like Captain Kirk chasin a villain he
81:57 isolate him in space and they have this
82:00 dialogue and eventually he he destroys
82:02 the ship and he's celebrated by all of
82:04 his Co Co commanders or Co whatever his
82:08 subordinates and then we flash into the
82:11 normal world where it goes 16 by 9
82:13 aspect ratio on your TV and he is
82:16 getting out of an elevator and he's a
82:17 total nerd having to push his way
82:19 through he's a very meek conservative
82:21 guy he goes into the company and his
82:24 badge doesn't work and the the
82:26 receptionist has given him crap about
82:28 renewing his badge and he finally gets
82:29 in you find out he's the CTO of a game
82:31 company and his partner in crime the CEO
82:35 is actually this very famous actor let
82:37 me get his name here Jimmy Simpson you
82:41 will have seen this guy in Carnivale
82:44 house of cards and Westworld he plays
82:47 the young newcomer to Westworld I won't
82:51 run who he really is
82:52 but he's that guy so what you find out
82:58 is there's this weird thing going on
82:59 where all the people in the office that
83:01 he has problems with because he's very
83:03 socially awkward or in his game he's
83:06 inventor of this game and that day he
83:10 has a girl knock on his door come in new
83:13 girl in the office and she is a engine
83:16 architect and she is just fawning over
83:19 the guy she's like you are the best
83:23 coder I've ever seen your code is
83:24 amazing I love your work you're the
83:27 reason why I want to work Karen seems
83:28 like he's kind of smitten with her his
83:31 CEO partner this Jimmy Simpson guy comes
83:33 in and he's like yelling at him for the
83:36 release date of the upgrade to the game
83:37 he loses track of the conversation then
83:40 he hijacks the girl and takes her on a
83:42 tour of the company and so immediately
83:43 he's like god dammit I lost this
83:44 beautiful girl to my [ __ ] partner and
83:47 so he is he is essentially unable to
83:50 warm up the conversation and tried to go
83:55 how far to go with this before ruining
83:58 this for you with a spoiler you find out
84:02 I'm just gonna end it right here you
84:04 find out that there's a reason why the
84:06 people in the office that have a problem
84:08 with him have
84:10 been essentially duplicated in his game
84:12 and the girl the new girl finds herself
84:16 in his game and she isn't having it okay
84:21 and so it's the plot of the people that
84:24 are stuck in the game as catalyzed by
84:25 this new girl who says I ain't putting
84:27 up with this [ __ ] they've all been
84:28 beaten down inside the game and so
84:30 they're willing to do it and they're
84:31 essentially in a way a duplicate of the
84:35 people in real world in this video game
84:36 and so he if he has a problem with
84:39 someone in the real world he goes into
84:41 the game finds their duplicate and then
84:43 harasses them and beats them up and
84:45 chokes them and that kind of stuffs it
84:46 gets it off his chest and he pops back
84:47 out but it's way more detailed than that
84:50 and it is endearing to the last drop so
84:52 I've seen this episode probably gosh
84:56 another five times and I continue to
84:59 show it to my friends in Hollywood in
85:02 fact I was able to sit down on Tuesday
85:04 this week and show it to Stephen Lewis
85:06 Berger one of my good friends and who
85:08 wrote and directed Tron and I said look
85:10 this sister Andre is the Tron 2.0 right
85:12 here and he had a good time with it he
85:14 was he was saying this is amazing he
85:16 loved the show he hasn't seen any other
85:17 episodes but yeah so this is a great
85:21 episode so the the second second episode
85:28 of season four is Archangel and it has
85:33 to do with the product that's called
85:34 Archangel whereby a parent can put in
85:37 those or take advantage of the eyes
85:40 those eyes that can be recorded and they
85:43 put a surveillance on their child so
85:44 they can start to see what their child
85:46 sees because it's a single mom raising a
85:49 kid and so she's worried about her
85:51 daughter seeing things but in the in
85:53 addition to the normal surveillance
85:55 technology she chooses to turn on the
85:56 option it's an experimental product it's
85:59 not in full swing in the world but to
86:01 tell her to block her child from seeing
86:04 things that she shouldn't see
86:05 so her child for instance grows up to be
86:08 kind of a young teenager and there's
86:11 obviously the kids on the playground
86:13 that show girls things they shouldn't
86:15 see like pornographic material on an
86:18 iPad and she's looking at it and she
86:19 can't see it so it's that block
86:21 technology from white bear
86:22 our certain white Christmas excuse me
86:24 and it's being used to block her vision
86:27 which sort of retards her maturity in
86:30 the world and so eventually that gets
86:33 disabled and she's a she's a teenager
86:36 and she gets into boys and so the of
86:40 course just like a lot of kids
86:42 she's fibbing about where she is and of
86:44 course the what ends up happening is the
86:46 mother agrees to stop spying on her
86:48 daughter because her daughter's like
86:49 look how am i growing up now you have no
86:51 right to be looking in my eyeballs and
86:52 she puts away the device which is like
86:54 this iPad but there's a particular night
86:57 where she loses track of her daughter
86:58 starts being paranoid and turns it on
87:01 and finds out that she's making love to
87:03 her boyfriend and of course that is a
87:05 horrific thing when your child is I
87:07 guess under 18 now the actors playing
87:09 this girl is well over 18 I think but it
87:12 ensues from there the fourth episode of
87:18 sorry the third episode of season four
87:20 is called crocodile and sort of a goofy
87:23 name it you know again when I name these
87:26 episodes on the show it really does
87:29 affect the success of an episode if I'm
87:31 too cryptic I dig you know the the
87:34 emails I got back from Steve Jobs for
87:36 the first couple years I was talking to
87:38 him we're like single words that says
87:39 he's famous for that something about
87:41 that amazing optimization of minimalism
87:44 and your communication it effectively
87:46 communicates what you need to hear
87:47 that's something I do so krokodil is
87:52 kind of a weird title for this but it
87:53 starts off with an episode where a
87:55 couple is travelling in a car they're in
87:57 these kind of snowy mountains somewhere
87:59 in Europe and they probably England
88:02 somewhere I can't recognize it they
88:04 accidentally hit a bicyclist I think
88:07 it's a bicycle and they killed a guy
88:10 on accident completely an accident but
88:12 instead of coughing up to the crime or
88:15 the the mistake I should say the
88:17 accident and telling the cops and trying
88:18 to get cleared they wrap up the body in
88:21 a blanket and throw it into this little
88:26 lake pond stream or whatever and then
88:28 they throw the bike into there and they
88:29 completely cover up their tracks well
88:32 fast forward I think it's like 10 years
88:34 the woman becomes a solid
88:36 rated arc architect and she she not only
88:39 has that she's got books and she speaks
88:41 on appearances she's somewhere in Europe
88:44 and doing some lecture and this guy that
88:48 she was with who I'd like to dimension
88:51 they had been drinking beer in the car
88:52 so it's probably didn't go the cops he
88:54 had actually cleaned up his act and
88:56 gotten off alcohol and he shows up to
88:58 her hotel and says I'm going to well she
89:02 said he says he gives her a piece of
89:04 newspaper clipping and says which he
89:07 says I did a printout because you know
89:09 in the future there shouldn't be any
89:10 paper newspapers so to make the drama
89:12 work he shows it to her and they had
89:15 found the gentleman's body ten years
89:17 later and they did the DNA makes and
89:20 they found out who he was and so they
89:21 were notifying the wife who had been
89:23 waiting they didn't know this two
89:25 backstory until this was all connected
89:27 that the woman never got remarried and
89:29 said my husband will be coming home
89:30 because he loves me and until his body's
89:32 found I'm not going to marry anyone else
89:33 so he feels so guilty
89:35 that she lost her life the second her
89:38 husband died he's like I'm gonna write
89:40 her a letter and tell her what happened
89:41 and this woman's like don't do that
89:44 we're in the clear you write that letter
89:46 they're gonna figure out where it came
89:47 from they're gonna find you then they're
89:49 gonna find me and I have a perfect life
89:51 don't do this but he resists and resists
89:55 and they have a scuffle and her suite
89:58 where she's speaking and she kills him
90:01 she doesn't mean to but it happens so
90:05 now she has to dispose of the body and
90:09 unbeknownst to her a gentleman outside
90:12 right at the time she had killed this
90:14 guy and everything settled down she
90:15 walks to the window to look out the
90:17 window and just kind of despair of like
90:19 oh my god what did I just do now I'm
90:21 involved with two deaths right even
90:22 though she wasn't driving the first car
90:24 there's an accident outside a guy who
90:27 steps in front of a pizza an automated
90:29 kind of Tesla Pizza truck and gets hit
90:32 and he's a I think he's a violinist or a
90:35 cello player and he breaks his arm and
90:38 so there's an insurance claim that's
90:39 being processed on the guy so this
90:41 Indian woman is the insurance adjuster
90:43 and she goes to him and interviews him
90:45 and they used this viewing memory thing
90:48 for one of the first episodes
90:50 and draws back what he remembered about
90:53 it he gives him literally a beer because
90:55 he walked by a brewery to help you know
90:57 exacerbate his memory and she doesn't
91:00 get enough information to really process
91:02 the claim which is how fast was this car
91:04 moving then he but he remembers a girl
91:08 in front of him that was also on the
91:10 scene so she does a pattern recognition
91:12 on that girl's face from his memories
91:14 gives her the test and you're not
91:17 allowed to not take the test it's a law
91:20 now in the world so she doesn't know
91:24 quite the information she adds a little
91:26 bit more data to it but then she and her
91:29 eyesight sees the girl and the in the
91:32 window which is our girl that just
91:34 murdered the guy so this insurance in
91:37 chester is now running around trying to
91:41 find out who this person is and
91:43 eventually she connects with our main
91:44 girl and that's really where the the
91:47 chaos begins so that's that particular
91:50 episode episode 4 of season 4 is called
91:55 hang the DJ and that's based on the song
91:58 hang the DJ way back in the 80s this is
92:02 about this is a brilliant episode about
92:04 a dating service that we we have these
92:07 dating services in the world where you
92:09 do these random sit downs with people
92:10 and so this is a an episode where people
92:16 come to a booth they sit down they have
92:18 these little pucks that have a computer
92:20 interface on the top and what they do
92:21 very quickly and during the date is they
92:24 they agree to look at how much time
92:25 they've been allocated to be together
92:27 you're a little confused at first cuz
92:29 you're like well that doesn't exist in
92:30 this world again take a little bit of
92:31 technology put it in dating and move it
92:33 forward and see what happens they put
92:35 their thumbprint on their individual
92:36 pucks they get the same readout in this
92:39 particular one I think they got 24 hours
92:40 together and so they quickly eat their
92:42 food they jump in these electric cars
92:44 that take them to these bungalows and
92:46 they could do whatever they want they
92:49 can consent to sex they can just hang
92:50 out together and they spend their first
92:54 night together I'll let you watch the
92:56 show to see what happens then they get
92:57 back on the electric cars to separate
92:59 cars and they get taken to two separate
93:01 locations and now they're waiting for
93:02 the next date
93:03 the next date the guy gets a year and
93:05 the girl gets nine months kind of
93:08 shouldn't be telling you this but you
93:09 know it's not part of the spoiling the
93:12 episode part of it but so now he's gonna
93:14 have three more months than she has
93:16 well this continues with the promise
93:18 that one day this artificial
93:21 intelligence that is watching everything
93:22 that happens and I mean everything that
93:24 happens any arguments they have if they
93:26 have sex whether they're good sex the
93:28 comments that each one are making behind
93:30 the back of the other person's all being
93:32 aggregated to find the perfect person
93:33 and what you find out is that they're in
93:37 this sort of dum da dum goth but this
93:39 walled off region of the world it's like
93:42 a West world but probably smaller where
93:44 they're having all these dates and
93:45 they're in there simply to find their
93:46 mate and once they find their mate they
93:48 get to leave and have a wonderful life
93:50 and there's testimonies of couples that
93:52 say it does work
93:53 don't worry because where does it might
93:55 get this is all worth it again living
93:58 with the wrong person rest of your life
93:59 is the worst thing in the world look
94:01 what the best person for you is the best
94:03 thing you could possibly happen so that
94:08 continues until things get a little more
94:12 interesting I'll just put it that way
94:14 but it's a it's a really really cool
94:16 episode as it really I think a very
94:19 positive ending to it and the final
94:22 episode 5 of season 4 is called
94:26 metalhead and this is actually very
94:28 interesting because they filmed it in
94:29 black and white and if you've ever seen
94:31 all the Twilight zones they're all in
94:33 black and white because RCA I had the
94:34 patent on color and they weren't sharing
94:36 it with anyone you had to pay an extra
94:38 premium to get color before that point
94:39 which thank God that was the case
94:42 because the Twilight zones are
94:43 absolutely endearing in black and white
94:44 so this is filmed in a more grayscale
94:47 black-and-white and there's been some
94:50 mysterious collapse to humanity and so
94:53 you have these three people in a car
94:55 driving in through this world that it's
94:57 just it's it's not necessarily decimated
94:59 with bombs or anything but it's sort of
95:01 deteriorated right and they are having
95:03 sort of this conversation about things
95:06 and situations that you don't quite
95:07 understand at first which is always
95:09 really intriguing to the mind because
95:11 you and then you remember all the things
95:13 you didn't understand as things unravel
95:14 in front of you
95:15 they start to explain themselves which
95:17 is always a good little resolve to the
95:19 mystery they're going out to find some
95:22 supplies to help someone who's sick
95:24 they've come to this warehouse where
95:26 they think those supplies exist but
95:28 they're very paranoid about something
95:30 that you don't know anything about
95:33 you're like why are they so scared you
95:34 know I mean if you played fallout 4 you
95:36 could imagine some of these scavengers
95:39 coming after them but you just don't
95:41 know and so they get in this warehouse
95:42 is very clean very well-kept and they're
95:45 just looking for boxes and eventually
95:46 find the box that they're looking for on
95:48 this top shelf and so they bring up one
95:49 of those sort of Home Depot portable
95:52 staircases and this guy gets up there on
95:55 the staircase and pulls out the box and
95:58 hands it down and doesn't realize that I
96:01 think what they call it dog it's this
96:03 little tiny Boston Dynamics robot thing
96:06 that in real life would probably be
96:09 about two feet it looks like a little
96:11 cockroach and it has its arms all folded
96:14 underneath itself and then when it
96:16 stands up it looks like a dog with a
96:17 cockroach body and you can see it as all
96:19 the stealth patterns of you know stealth
96:21 design and you can kind of see the front
96:24 head of its glass so there must be the
96:26 sensors underneath em and it immediately
96:29 opens up a little aperture in its head
96:31 like a little whale spout and spits out
96:33 this thing that then blows up and it
96:36 hits this guy in the face and it puts
96:38 these little pieces of metal in his face
96:40 it's not terminal doesn't kill him but
96:43 what you find out is that these little
96:44 tiny triangular pieces of steel have
96:46 little beacons inside them and once
96:47 you've been identified as a human these
96:52 robots seem to be killing human beings
96:55 and what you'll find as signals all the
96:58 bots in the area to look for you and
97:00 shoot you and so one of the little hands
97:04 has a little gun on it and it reaches up
97:05 and shoots the guy in the hit and so the
97:08 other two completely freaked out because
97:10 they know what's going on and they all
97:12 start running from this little dog thing
97:14 it starts to come after them so it ends
97:19 up with a single character surviving and
97:21 she is trying to dodge this thing she's
97:24 trying to to get back to her clan which
97:28 somewhere in the world off camera using
97:31 walkie-talkies a talk to them trying to
97:32 give them progress about her she's
97:34 trying to evade this thing this thing
97:36 can can if she were to hide in a room
97:39 for instance and be safe it just waits
97:41 out front you know it's like one of
97:42 those situations so what this does is
97:45 really talk to we got to be very careful
97:49 with things like Boston Dynamics robots
97:50 getting again like I said in my robotics
97:55 episode way back in season one you don't
97:58 need massive artificial intelligence how
98:00 9,000 AI to create a horrible situation
98:03 for the world where we could be
98:05 exterminated by these little robots some
98:09 of you may have seen the new clip on
98:12 YouTube which was a it was a fictional
98:15 thing generated for some show but it
98:17 shows how the swarm drones those little
98:20 drones that are about the size of pack
98:23 of cigarettes can fly around and if
98:26 their belly in this particular snare the
98:28 belly had a had a bullet in it so it
98:30 flies that figures out what your face is
98:32 and then it essentially bangs into your
98:35 forehead and shoots you with a single
98:37 round in your head and kills you so with
98:39 swarm technology they could wipe out the
98:41 whole planet and I think again the
98:45 episode I'm done talking about that but
98:48 just as a further subtext to this
98:50 concept if we were dying up a bunch of
98:53 viruses let's say are a virus that went
98:55 around some crazy things killing
98:57 everybody society would be not blaming
99:01 the government necessarily unless there
99:03 was proof the government invented it
99:04 which I'm sure they have but you might
99:07 be sort of empathetic to your government
99:09 and say oh god please help me please
99:11 give me food and water and then they
99:12 start you know you know figuring out
99:15 what your score is you know whether or
99:17 not you're a person who's against
99:19 manipulation and tyranny and so you're
99:21 just shot or if you get your food and
99:23 you can survive in some were docile
99:25 tyranny however what if you knew from
99:29 the very very get-go that it was some
99:33 shadow government actually exterminating
99:35 everybody and that as soon as they
99:38 exterminated most people whoever's left
99:41 it's many situations where you're gonna
99:43 behave because you know they can kill
99:44 you very easily with these swarms these
99:47 swarms have been utterly invented I've
99:50 worked in a facility for last year where
99:53 the swarm technology was being
99:54 programmed and you know you could be in
99:57 a room and you would have there's all
100:00 kinds of videos I'm on like this is not
100:01 secret knowledge but you could have ten
100:03 little tiny micro drones flying together
100:05 like a swarm of bees and they can fly
100:09 full bore at a human being and just dive
100:12 around you and then stop and turn around
100:14 come the other way because the
100:15 artificial intelligence is good enough
100:17 to do you know sort of pattern
100:21 recognition and get around you they can
100:23 also do pattern recognition find out
100:24 your human right you have a certain size
100:26 when you're a human you have certain
100:27 heat signatures when human they could
100:29 find a fioor child if you're a female if
100:30 you're a male so this is sort of an
100:35 interesting episode I think a lot of us
100:37 want to think that these writers are
100:39 sneaking in precautionary tales to say
100:41 this is why you need to stop this but on
100:44 the predictive programming side it can
100:46 simply be as horrific as this is this is
100:49 why you should fear your government and
100:50 do what they say and stop writing you
100:53 know emails against vaccinations online
100:56 and you should comply comply and comply
100:57 and the more they feed you GMOs and
101:00 vaccinations you're just going to keep
101:02 going down the tubes until you have no
101:04 genetic Constitution to fight back so
101:08 that is the review the very long
101:09 detailed review of Black Mirror and why
101:11 I think that each and every one of you
101:13 should see this again I I love all the
101:17 episodes on one level obviously I love
101:20 some way more than the others you will
101:22 probably be the same but this is some
101:25 great television so far so hopefully
101:27 season 5 will continue to blow us away
101:31 now they're making them every single
101:33 year they make them all in one shot they
101:35 release them all one shot on Netflix for
101:37 me it's worth the $11.99 or whatever it
101:40 is in the United States to subscribe to
101:42 Netflix to get this particular show boom
101:46 if you dig this show I'm just gonna give
101:48 you the short bumper since we're talking
101:50 forever go to deep thoughts radio.com
101:51 all the links are there audio video and
101:53 patreon I've pulled the PayPal since
101:56 it's not being used and a reason to fill
101:58 up the world with that kind of stuff
101:59 anyway thank you for joining take care
102:01 of yourself and someone else and I will
102:03 see in the next few thoughts over
