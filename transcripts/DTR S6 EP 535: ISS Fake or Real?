00:14 so

00:27 [Music]
00:35 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen
00:38 now miss dove back there with her
00:40 transparent eyelid
00:41 is trying to get a freak on so she might
00:43 be in the microphone for quite a while
00:45 but she's sort of soothing all right
00:47 folks
00:48 so many of you have been waiting for
00:50 sort of a
00:51 redo of the iss aka
00:56 international space station episode next
00:58 one we're gonna do is uh
01:01 jpl thanks to a listener who reminded me
01:04 you should focus on that for a whole
01:06 episode
01:08 so let's see here and you know i'll tell
01:10 you what
01:12 when we talk about things like the uh uh
01:15 the moon missions you know it's
01:19 much easier to pick that apart determine
01:22 what is real
01:23 what is fake and the international space
01:27 station is not one of those things
01:30 and we'll get into it so this this
01:34 idea of an international space station
01:35 supposedly originated back in the 50s
01:38 by one of the uh paperclip guys
01:41 and it wasn't von braun as you know von
01:44 braun
01:45 said look if you want to get to the moon
01:46 you got to build a space station
01:49 and once you get done with that you
01:50 gotta ferry fuel up to the space station
01:53 meaning store fuel inside of it and then
01:55 you got to build a rocket
01:57 that pushes a ship up there then that
02:00 ship will detach from the rocket
02:02 dock at the space station fill up with
02:04 the fuel and then drive straight to the
02:06 moon
02:08 that was the plan that's why von braun
02:11 did that on the disney channel in 56 or
02:13 so
02:15 and stanley kubrick used that model
02:17 slash arthur c
02:18 clarke used that model for the movie
02:20 2001 a space odyssey
02:23 that was the way you did it and then
02:27 nasa looked at that plan and went oh my
02:28 god that's like 100 years worth of work
02:31 we're not going to be able to do that so
02:34 we got a different idea magic special
02:37 effects
02:38 now let me just take a step back from
02:41 you
02:41 from all this sort of space stuff and
02:44 remind you
02:45 of a financial reality if you're a young
02:48 whippersnapper listen up because
02:50 this will change your life we have
02:53 things called
02:55 savings accounts and then we have things
02:58 called
02:59 annuities and the difference
03:02 is this you put a bunch of money in a
03:04 savings account well
03:06 your bank's going to steal a bunch of
03:07 money for service fees
03:09 inflation is going to steal the value of
03:11 the money which is your government
03:13 ripping you off
03:14 so savings account is in current day
03:17 times because we have been
03:18 such cowards and allowed the world to be
03:20 taken over by all these
03:22 crazies under the guise of not being
03:25 crazy
03:26 which is hysterical savings accounts are
03:29 the worst thing you could possibly have
03:30 as the only way to store your money you
03:32 need to pop it out put it into gold pop
03:34 it out do something else
03:36 i'm not a financial advisor by the way
03:39 but annuity is an awesome thing you own
03:42 a bunch of homes that you rent to people
03:44 you own a hotel which you have
03:46 occupants for nothing's easy in life
03:48 okay these things come with issues
03:51 you could have a dividend coming out of
03:52 a company because you own a great
03:54 company or a good piece of a company
03:56 that is your retirement mechanism
03:59 because it generates cash
04:01 it doesn't just sit there as cash
04:05 now of course it's terrifying to put
04:06 your money in anything these days
04:08 so i sympathize if you're like yeah well
04:10 you know and then gold you have to
04:12 convert to money if you want to spend it
04:15 the goal is a great mechanism in my
04:17 opinion i've done that myself
04:19 at times but why mention this little
04:21 economic lesson
04:23 because they knew when they did the moon
04:26 missions
04:27 eventually that was it was going to
04:29 catch up with them they honestly did
04:31 more moon missions than i
04:32 would have ever thought they would have
04:34 done now that i know the platform
04:35 which is seven attempts six successes
04:40 the third one was specifically designed
04:42 to not work
04:44 to gain the attention of folks back to
04:46 the missions right people started
04:47 calling and complaining after the second
04:49 launch
04:51 what's this crap doing on tv i love
04:53 lucy's getting pushed to the side
04:54 i don't want to see your moon crap
04:56 anymore so then apollo 13
04:58 corrected that little complaint
05:01 and everybody loved it all the way to
05:03 17. then the space shuttle comes around
05:07 which is a methodology of putting
05:09 payloads in space
05:11 because the game moved from
05:12 intercontinental ballistic missiles to
05:13 owning space
05:15 now i'm sure that the second that
05:18 sputnik
05:19 went up there and orbited the plans for
05:22 dominating space
05:23 in terms of low orbit objects was
05:26 definitely
05:26 immediately conceived of but without the
05:29 moon missions
05:31 being orchestrated and developing the
05:33 icbm backbone
05:35 you don't have a methodology to reliably
05:37 every single time you need to put
05:38 something in about 200 mile up
05:40 orbit or more geocentric about 22 000
05:44 all right but the space shuttle comes
05:47 around
05:49 space shuttle provides a mechanism to
05:52 routinely spend hundreds of millions of
05:55 dollars routinely
05:56 reusable object the only thing that
05:59 doesn't come back is the central tank
06:01 all kinds of plans were put together to
06:03 use that tank for a bunch of stuff
06:05 not a single plan ever went through as
06:06 far as i know
06:08 i mean those tanks would have been
06:09 amazing to
06:12 put some sort of attachment mechanism
06:14 together that's very aerodynamic so when
06:17 it launches no big deal
06:18 but you have you know dozens and dozens
06:20 of these gigantic tanks out there
06:23 imagine just clicking them together
06:25 clicking them together
06:27 built you know sense and propulsion unit
06:28 up there to keep them in orbit
06:31 and you could have built some gigantic
06:33 thing up there and then just
06:34 once you get it all welded together
06:36 click together and start penetrating
06:39 you know pre-made doors that are a
06:40 little thinner or whatever and you could
06:42 have made a pretty amazing
06:44 globular thing up there in space
06:47 so in 1984 i should say by 1984
06:52 this concept of an international space
06:54 station or sorry a space station excuse
06:55 me it wasn't considered international
06:57 until later
06:58 america wanted to create a space station
07:01 they put some designs together looked
07:04 considerably different and
07:05 measurably smaller essentially take out
07:08 most of the european contribution or
07:10 russian contributions excuse me
07:12 but a few of the european contributions
07:13 and you'd have about the size of the
07:15 84 design but for some reason and this
07:19 almost baffles me
07:20 they canceled it they didn't go along
07:23 with it in 1984.
07:26 but the concept had been you know
07:28 debuted
07:29 infected the mines and so you had to
07:32 wait
07:34 10 years for this thing to come back
07:35 around but in the meantime
07:37 the russians were like ah we'll be the
07:39 first ones to do it
07:40 and they put the mirror up there and the
07:43 mirror you know
07:45 fairly impressive little design you
07:47 watched it crash in the south park
07:49 episode which is where most people
07:50 learned it existed
07:52 but now let's say that you wanted to
07:53 build something but you didn't have as
07:55 much
07:55 uh didn't have all the money you needed
07:57 to do it
07:59 a good example of this is all the disney
08:02 parks
08:04 i don't know if you've ever been to a
08:05 disney park but if you have you'll
08:07 notice that every major ride has a
08:09 sponsor
08:10 over the top energizer used to do all
08:12 the space stuff
08:13 mars candy bar company used to do a
08:16 couple of the rides
08:18 but everything had a sponsor because
08:19 this ride these rides cost a tremendous
08:21 amount of money
08:22 just here in southern california when
08:24 they did the radiator springs expansion
08:26 which is the pixar movie cars being
08:28 expanded
08:30 into california park the
08:34 expansion was over a billion dollars
08:37 of money it's really enchanting as hell
08:40 and the uh the right at the end of the
08:43 park
08:44 where you're in the car it's actually
08:45 pretty cool so you know for ten years
08:48 roughly technically eleven
08:51 a group of people are putting together
08:54 the modules putting together
08:55 sort of like the basics of what this
08:57 thing would need to be
08:58 in order to accomplish anything and then
09:01 they
09:02 go out and get partners in europe japan
09:05 canada russia and they put this whole
09:08 thing together
09:10 on a paper and then there's going to be
09:14 three techniques of getting this thing
09:16 into space you're gonna have the space
09:18 shuttle
09:19 the russian photon rocket or proton
09:22 rocket as i was called yeah proton rock
09:23 excuse me and then the uh
09:25 the soyuz which is still used to this
09:27 day
09:29 now i'm giving you the foundation
09:30 because last episode i didn't i just
09:32 started talking about the things that
09:33 are very very suspect about this thing
09:36 so the way this thing comes together is
09:37 that you have several modules going up
09:40 that are all russian and all being
09:42 attached they said there was over a
09:44 thousand hours
09:45 of eva which means space walking
09:49 work they went up in about six month
09:52 increments
09:53 you've got robotic arms from from canada
09:56 again
09:56 which is what they've contributed to the
09:58 space shuttle program apparently
10:01 you have a japanese module goes up
10:03 towards the end there and they've got
10:04 their own little robot
10:05 arm there's this wild ass
10:08 robot that attaches to in most cases the
10:11 arm
10:13 i've watched several documentaries about
10:14 the various modules
10:17 we're not going to get into those
10:18 because it's just a nerd fest and
10:20 other videos that do a much better job
10:23 but obviously you know that there's
10:25 areas that are that were supposed to
10:26 have been habitat only
10:29 and then various science oriented
10:34 capsules the outside is
10:37 was ingenious in that they built it in
10:41 pieces that then
10:44 would get you to the next stage and then
10:46 when the new pieces showed up sometimes
10:48 they take a piece and move it to the
10:49 other side and expand it up and
10:51 so the vehicle would appear symmetrical
10:54 at the very very end it's symmetrical
10:56 it's
10:56 obviously approximately the size of an
10:59 american
11:00 football field just recently you know
11:02 thing comes to a close
11:05 and you know what's strange is they're
11:07 now
11:08 talking about canceling the project
11:13 apparently it has funding until 2025.
11:16 you guys are seeing all these feeds and
11:19 this is where we have
11:21 we're going to begin getting into the
11:23 potential that this thing is not what
11:25 they say it is
11:27 simply because the footage that we're
11:29 getting from this
11:31 object is
11:35 you know tremendously suspect to say the
11:38 least
11:39 now do i think we can put an object 250
11:42 miles up in the sky
11:44 yeah i do absolutely
11:47 and whatever your model of the earth is
11:51 there's something for each model of the
11:53 earth that accounts for something being
11:55 in orbit
11:57 up so you don't need to split hairs
12:01 the classic question about the iss and
12:03 the very first one and i have not been
12:05 able to
12:07 dismiss this because i was unable to
12:09 find the footage of it
12:12 is it the initial construction of this
12:15 monumental thing
12:16 by man in space again the mirror went
12:19 first
12:21 you know way back in the 60s there was a
12:23 module connection
12:24 thing that happened which is cool
12:28 supposedly i don't believe it but anyway
12:31 there's no footage of this thing being
12:32 put together
12:35 no footage and then you get all of a
12:36 sudden breathtaking footage of this
12:38 place
12:40 from a camera that no one can seem to
12:42 explain as well as
12:44 the camera in some of these shots looks
12:46 like uh
12:47 someone's hand holding it in space now
12:50 without a massive tether hooked to an
12:52 astronaut
12:53 in some suit uh i wouldn't be as far
12:56 away from this
12:57 space station as this dude appears in
12:59 these shots
13:00 because just one thing goes wrong and
13:02 you'd be
13:04 frank in 2001 a space odyssey floating
13:06 out to nowhere
13:08 so a giant portion of this gets put
13:09 together and again where's the footage
13:12 who would you be protecting from a
13:14 national defense
13:16 realm russia is involved in the project
13:20 america has involved the product europe
13:22 japan who's left
13:24 who's left that you wouldn't film this
13:26 because there's no
13:27 threat i mean everybody knows how this
13:29 thing's put together they traded modules
13:31 because they built
13:32 a module for the ground and they built a
13:33 module for space and then they would
13:36 uh because the russian
13:39 ports are a little bit different
13:41 apparently than our ports and europe's
13:43 ports
13:44 there's this little junction port it's
13:47 actually the most bizarre looking thing
13:48 because it actually
13:49 tilts down maybe there's more to that
13:51 than i i'm aware of
13:54 so they're involved everyone's involved
13:56 but yeah
13:57 no footage of it being built that's
13:59 suspect to me it just is call me
14:02 sensitive to history
14:06 but here's why this episode exists
14:11 because four to five years ago there was
14:14 a gigantic explosion in people being
14:16 very very interested in this
14:18 it is interesting how we all just sort
14:21 of
14:23 bump into a conspiracy we do our
14:26 research
14:27 even if you think someone's blowing
14:28 smoke in some of the videos because
14:31 they're trying to latch onto
14:32 legitimate stuff or trying to disinfo
14:35 the legitimate stuff
14:37 even the inner ci you're sitting there
14:38 going okay well that's fake but that's
14:39 definitely real
14:40 that means that what we're being told
14:42 isn't true
14:44 there was this event i don't know
14:47 two years ago three years ago where the
14:50 space station went in front of the moon
14:53 and some friends of mine in la who were
14:55 special effects guys got on top of their
14:57 building and
14:58 hooked up a telescope and recorded it
15:00 with a
15:01 camera and managed to snap that shot
15:04 you know for it flowing in front of the
15:06 moon and two or three different places
15:07 did it
15:10 so if you think it doesn't exist up
15:11 there in space i i
15:13 would challenge you to dispute how three
15:16 or four of my friends got the shot
15:19 that's only in front of the moon for a
15:20 split second so these folks had to
15:22 hook it up to high-speed cameras but
15:24 they that's exactly what they have
15:27 they have 60 frames per second 4k
15:30 cameras
15:31 because they're special effects homes
15:32 that actually do you know the principal
15:34 footage for various effects
15:36 so that's why these folks climbed on the
15:38 roof and did that now what's funny is
15:40 one of my buddies
15:41 who's just a consummate liar and he
15:43 doesn't realize he is
15:45 uh it's funny it's like he's kind of
15:47 dopey now because he's really old but he
15:49 just
15:49 flies through his teeth constantly and
15:51 we all just listen oh yeah okay
15:53 he's like i i bent down and i looked
15:55 through and i saw it
15:57 well obviously it's moving too fast for
15:59 him to bend down look through
16:00 and see it right so
16:05 that kind of stuff happens you know the
16:06 people want to be a part of something so
16:08 they just latch on to
16:10 well me too you know in the end you kind
16:13 of have about an eight-year-old inside
16:15 of an older body
16:16 and they manage to keep that that
16:18 necessity to be
16:19 in the in crowd it's just a weird thing
16:21 man
16:23 but now the footage which i'm going to
16:25 show in this
16:26 episode which is going to make it take
16:28 an extra day to edit but that's
16:29 going to be worth it if you were in
16:32 space you would obviously be in a
16:34 container
16:35 that because you are in a heliocentric
16:37 model you are falling
16:39 around the
16:42 ball of earth so it's just like if i
16:44 throw a rock and you see it fall
16:46 well imagine if i threw it so far and so
16:49 fast
16:50 that before it fell to hit the ground it
16:52 actually exceeds
16:54 the boundary of earth and so then it's
16:56 falling but then it's being grabbed by
16:58 the ether winds pushing on it
17:00 pushing on earth from all sides right it
17:02 just keeps
17:04 hanging onto the earth the whole time
17:05 until eventually those heathrow winds
17:07 catch up
17:09 and it starts to burn up in the
17:10 atmosphere as we've seen many objects do
17:13 the mirror being one of them so the
17:16 space station is you know roughly
17:18 hovering about 250 miles
17:20 its orbit diminishes of course and has
17:23 to be pushed back up
17:24 [Music]
17:25 but we do all these videos i say we as a
17:28 world
17:30 where these astronauts are up there and
17:31 they're talking to kids down
17:33 on earth and they get recorded you know
17:35 and they get put into
17:36 uh youtube and that's where we see these
17:39 things
17:40 but they make gigantic mistakes
17:43 and proving that this place isn't what
17:47 we think it is is only
17:48 really the beginning of the conversation
17:50 to be honest
17:51 and so we have to prove a couple of
17:53 these things
17:54 one of the classic things they do to
17:56 prove that they're in zero gravity
17:59 is to do a front flip on camera
18:02 and so they they do a front flip so they
18:05 know where their head is
18:07 if you back flip uh then you don't know
18:08 where your head is so if they do that
18:10 then they really feel safe
18:12 but one of the guys there's four of them
18:15 talking to some kids right so two in the
18:16 front and two behind them they stacked
18:18 them like that
18:19 and they're you know doing the floating
18:20 thing like this you know
18:22 and then they do this forward flip
18:26 and this guy ends up getting himself
18:28 caught on his
18:30 david copperfield harness and these
18:33 harnesses have been used
18:34 way back in the 1800s when people wanted
18:36 to fly and do peter pan type things
18:40 but he doesn't make it all the way
18:41 around easily
18:43 so the guy next to him sort of helps him
18:45 out and accidentally grabs the wire
18:49 attached to his left hip and the
18:52 evidence of this
18:53 is that the shirt that's underneath the
18:56 wire
18:56 pulls out in a triangle
19:00 proving that there was a harness there
19:03 it's brilliantly done i mean
19:04 we could do real-time wire erasing at
19:07 this point
19:09 why do you think photoshop offers you
19:10 the ability to subtract someone out of a
19:12 photo
19:13 because that algorithm is ancient now it
19:16 was used to it's still used every day in
19:17 hollywood to remove wires if wires are
19:19 necessary
19:21 which they are a lot of wires are the
19:24 color of the green screens but sometimes
19:27 that's not possible another big one
19:31 and i sure hope i can find all this uh
19:34 footage and i might
19:34 end up grabbing it from my old video i
19:37 can't find it
19:38 but there was a group of people
19:42 i think it was two guys and one girl
19:45 and the woman is over on the side
19:47 flipping
19:48 this little stuffed animal proving that
19:51 she's in zero gravity right
19:53 they always have this weird thing where
19:55 it's like
19:56 do something on camera that proves that
19:58 you're in zero gravity
19:59 that's the funny thing it seems
20:01 suspicious it seems just like just be on
20:03 camera would you
20:05 you know if you have a cool experiment
20:06 then do it but
20:08 if we're just trying to ask you about
20:10 the space station you don't need to be
20:11 sitting there messing around
20:13 because imagine imagine you're
20:16 watching the some award ceremony and
20:19 someone's going up there with the famous
20:21 envelope and they're cracking it open
20:22 and you're standing next to them but
20:24 you're flipping a
20:26 toy and over here watch me
20:29 don't watch that person with the
20:30 envelope watch me it's just it doesn't
20:32 seem like a professional format to be
20:34 distracting folks but this chick winds
20:36 up this
20:37 toy on the wire that's holding it
20:40 so much it starts to slide out in a
20:43 really weird angle
20:45 gaining its own physics there's another
20:49 shot where two guys are talking
20:52 to the camera there's a t joint behind
20:54 them
20:55 so between them is a
21:00 the tube goes down and then does a t
21:04 this dude flies by on a harness
21:07 not remotely
21:10 concealing the fact that he's wearing a
21:12 pretty heavy harness
21:14 with black straps and stuff
21:17 now having been close to all kinds of
21:20 wild productions in hollywood myself
21:22 and just study the the art itself i know
21:24 that that is a
21:26 on earth harness for special effects it
21:28 just is
21:30 now these first examples i'm giving you
21:33 are the ones that i think are legitimate
21:36 one other one internally which may or
21:38 may not be legitimate
21:39 because we could create it here in our
21:40 home is the famous shot where the guy is
21:44 trying to show you
21:47 that you can slingshot yourself down the
21:50 tube
21:51 you know just by hitting something and
21:52 pulling on it pulling on you just add
21:54 velocity and pressure and force to
21:56 yourself
21:58 you're in a weightless environment
21:59 there's nothing to slow you down
22:01 again just keep thinking about the moon
22:04 moon mission man
22:06 nothing to slow you down nothing to slow
22:08 you down
22:09 so then he grabs a door jamb
22:12 to the right of our perspective and he
22:15 disappears into a tube that's off to the
22:17 right
22:18 no big deal except somebody except
22:21 somebody slowed it down
22:23 and realized that the dude was going
22:24 transparent
22:26 before he went into the other realm
22:30 like he's on a blue screen or something
22:32 now we could do that to anyone in the
22:34 world
22:34 you could shoot a plate shot of your
22:37 like get a hallway like that and you put
22:40 your camera
22:41 on a tripod so you lock it down your mom
22:43 or dad walks down and turns into the
22:45 bathroom
22:46 so then we bring that into final cut
22:50 we take part of the frame before they
22:53 get there
22:54 and we put that off on its own layer
22:57 so when your mom or dad starts going
22:59 into the kitchen or into the bathroom or
23:01 whatever it is
23:02 you take that other plate and you put it
23:03 on top of them and you slowly fade it up
23:06 from zero opacity meaning totally
23:08 transparent to fully opaque meaning you
23:10 can't see through it
23:11 and you could create this little shot
23:12 and it circulated all over the world
23:14 that your mom or dad
23:15 is a ghost so even though that might be
23:18 a blatant situation
23:21 it may be a hoax brought in bush senior
23:24 in a wheelchair
23:26 to get between a command center and what
23:27 have you it looked amazing it looked
23:29 just like hollywood let me tell you
23:32 but he was at cape canaveral or sorry
23:34 houston sorry not cape canaveral
23:36 he's been houston eventually
23:40 and so you see all these crazy monitors
23:43 in the room
23:43 where he's getting his tour of nasa
23:45 houston right
23:47 and up on the screen is an astronaut
23:52 on the space station playing with a ball
23:56 except behind him is a
24:00 blue screen with a white grid on it
24:03 which allows the camera to engage in
24:07 what's called
24:08 augmented reality algorithms the grid is
24:12 there
24:13 as a bunch of markers so that if the
24:15 camera starts to move
24:17 right as long as that grid is relatively
24:19 smooth
24:20 meaning no imperfections the camera and
24:23 the mathematics that are looking at the
24:24 image
24:25 can calculate the distortion so that if
24:27 they want to put things
24:29 in the environment with him extra things
24:32 that don't exist
24:34 it's very easy these days i mean who
24:37 would have ever thought that deep fake
24:38 would exist to the accuracy that
24:40 that exists today and that you could do
24:42 it on your telephone
24:45 or do it in blender 3d or any product
24:46 out there it's very processor intensive
24:49 and there's a lot of
24:51 issues with lighting and what have you
24:52 but it's not that hard
24:55 around the time that bush senior is
24:57 pushed through this nasa
24:59 center
25:02 a bunch of that type of footage was
25:03 being broadcast to kids and all of us
25:05 here on the ground
25:08 and so it appears to
25:11 correlate with a lot of the stuff that
25:13 we were seeing at the time
25:15 so that makes it suspect right why would
25:18 you ever bring
25:19 virtual reality anything to the space
25:22 station for any reason whatsoever
25:25 you'd have to explain it now i bring up
25:28 the augmented reality thing
25:30 because there's a whole branch of
25:32 assertions
25:34 that these folks have
25:37 engaged in tremendous augmented reality
25:40 where
25:41 and this for me isn't as conclusive but
25:45 there's a
25:46 famous video and i was trying to
25:47 remember the context of the video but a
25:48 guy has a microphone
25:51 guys have watches and things and these
25:53 folks are
25:54 probably journalism they pick apart
25:56 every little thing that's moving around
25:58 and every time there's a communication
26:02 uh what i want to say pipeline burp
26:05 meaning the bandwidth between the space
26:06 station and earth
26:08 slops around right it's meaning the
26:10 compression algorithm is trying to make
26:11 up for missing pixels
26:13 meaning there's a bunch of juggling
26:15 parts of the image moving around
26:17 but these dudes jump on it see man it's
26:19 augmented reality and it's like
26:22 maybe maybe it's just a bad compression
26:24 thing like everybody who said that
26:26 a pupil that turned into a slit due to
26:29 compression algorithms and the early
26:31 internet
26:32 they kept accusing everyone of being
26:34 lizards that they were losing
26:36 their shape-changing capability
26:39 here these people are what be the funny
26:41 just this has occurred to me since i
26:43 last mentioned it
26:45 you have someone who's rested going on
26:47 an interview for a television show
26:49 like some sort of good morning america
26:51 and of course the algorithm
26:53 the bandwidth is bad the algorithm tries
26:56 to compensate
26:57 so you're getting slit things where
26:59 there's normally round pupils
27:02 but if you're talking about losing
27:04 energy to hold your form
27:06 i assure you it would be you know nicki
27:09 minaj at the end of a two-hour concert
27:12 jumping around that's where she's going
27:13 to start losing her her form and
27:15 sprout whatever you think she's got
27:17 underneath the hood there
27:19 it's not going to be some totally
27:21 well-rested moment where she's looking
27:23 great on tv it's just
27:24 it's not going to happen that way if if
27:26 you just take that theory and
27:28 use it against itself for me
27:31 part of me is just feeling very
27:33 fortunate that the lizard people thing
27:34 went away
27:35 like the reptilian theory if they're if
27:39 it's something there man people have
27:40 done the worst job ever
27:42 exposing it anyway now then we go
27:45 outside the space station for the other
27:48 type of footage the eva footage
27:52 this is where you're outside you're
27:54 you're doing some exercises to make sure
27:56 you know how to do it
27:57 now one thing i didn't know about the
27:59 space station was that
28:02 the robotic arm that canada built
28:04 actually has
28:05 a mount at its base and that mount can
28:08 actually attach all over the space
28:10 station so the little hand can reach out
28:12 and grab something holding itself in
28:14 place then they can undo the base
28:16 move it to a new location attach it and
28:18 then the arm can move around from that
28:19 location so
28:20 it's almost like an inch worm moving
28:22 around the um
28:24 moving around the space station it's
28:26 it's really brilliant then you have
28:28 a bunch of extra modules that aren't
28:31 encapsulated modules but they're sort of
28:33 like panels
28:34 that have giant supply containers on
28:37 them meaning
28:38 other bolts and containers and repair
28:40 things who knows
28:43 now the other one that surprised me when
28:45 i was reviewing
28:46 the composition of the space station was
28:48 that there's actually big thermal
28:50 dissipation panels
28:52 to supposedly exhaust the heat
28:56 from the space station
28:59 i don't get that at all at all at all
29:03 you were sitting in a very
29:06 terrifyingly cold location you know
29:09 couple hundred degrees below zero
29:11 fahrenheit
29:12 and so why would you need any assistance
29:17 venting heat where is all the seed going
29:19 to come from in the first place
29:21 i guess potentially they're talking
29:23 about that subatomic layer of
29:26 atoms that are up there that are are
29:28 moving so quickly that they
29:30 rate them at the super hot
29:34 you know temperatures of like 4 000
29:36 degrees celsius and things perhaps
29:37 that's what they're talking about but
29:38 then again
29:40 these dissipation panels you would think
29:43 if it was an if it was an all
29:47 attacking problem meaning the atmosphere
29:50 up there is going to
29:52 by the law of the thermodynamics the
29:54 third law of thermodynamics
29:56 hot always attracts the cold so every
29:59 single thing
30:00 up there should be getting bombarded
30:02 with this super hot
30:05 metal melting temperature
30:08 and so your dissipation panels would
30:09 have to almost be like a sphere around
30:12 the vehicle it would seem or at least
30:15 distributed evenly on all modules
30:17 that's not the case still very
30:20 interesting that that's something that's
30:22 on there
30:23 supposedly right and it should be
30:25 mentioned that the shape
30:26 of the space station that was seen in
30:29 the telescopes here in los angeles by
30:31 independent people
30:32 matches the shape of the object that's
30:34 up there
30:36 but when they're out there messing
30:37 around
30:40 there seems to be quite a few anomalies
30:42 going on
30:44 this is where we get into one of the
30:46 first
30:48 how did they do it conspiracies
30:51 which i think we need to safely separate
30:54 in our mind
30:54 the difference between what might be up
30:56 there that has that shape
30:58 it won't might be down here that is
31:01 being simulated to have that shape so
31:04 that they can
31:04 do whatever the hell they want so it
31:07 should also be mentioned
31:08 that even though you see the space
31:10 station in these telescope shots
31:14 if you wanted to create an illusion that
31:15 that actually happened
31:17 if you've ever known of well i'd say
31:20 monty python and the holy grail
31:22 quest for the holy grail they look for
31:24 camelot
31:25 and when they get there it's sure enough
31:27 in this shot
31:28 with this castle on a mountaintop and
31:31 then terry gilliam
31:32 who made the castle looks at the camera
31:34 goes it's only a model
31:37 and what they do is this forced
31:38 perspective thing right
31:40 the miniature of the castle
31:44 is much closer to the camera than you
31:45 think but shot in perspective with the
31:48 right light it looks like it's on top of
31:50 the hill
31:51 so if you wanted to fake a space station
31:52 flying by
31:55 i don't know exactly how you do this
31:57 thing you definitely need to make it
31:58 haul ass
32:00 but you throw it much closer to the
32:02 surface as a small object
32:04 that then looks like it's doing its
32:06 thing
32:07 now imagine you've got in los alamos
32:10 labs or
32:12 area 51 or something some really cool
32:15 fast propulsion system
32:16 because i've seen some drones man within
32:19 some of these laboratories
32:20 uh on video that are
32:24 unbelievable i mean they move extremely
32:25 fast they stop on a dime they move
32:28 so imagine one of these things having
32:30 some really cool propulsion system it's
32:31 going to go really quick but it's where
32:34 you expect to see it they throw it maybe
32:41 80 000 feet up or something like that
32:43 much closer
32:44 completes the illusion but nothing's
32:47 really there
32:48 so that's one way we can dismiss that if
32:50 we needed to
32:52 but the theory of how they're doing the
32:54 outside shots
32:57 is that they have a gigantic water tank
33:00 not the training one that you're aware
33:02 of but a much bigger one the training
33:03 one 6.5 million gallons i think
33:07 which is just gigantic if you watch the
33:10 training footage the only bubbles coming
33:12 off of
33:13 anything are the actual divers that are
33:16 in
33:17 diving suits with tanks and the whole
33:19 snorkel thing the astronauts
33:21 that are in the spacesuits that are
33:23 doing some exercise there's not a single
33:25 bubble coming off these guys
33:27 that's impressive so they have a little
33:30 system on them
33:31 now i think their oxygen is also a
33:34 supplemental oxygen
33:35 wire tube
33:38 that's painted white to look like
33:40 everything else it's off camera
33:43 but we think they might have a big giant
33:45 screen that is projecting
33:47 some image of earth the tank
33:50 has got some very very sanitized water
33:54 and there is a movement of
33:57 water and objects right water provides
34:00 resistance
34:02 depending on how fast you allow the
34:03 camera to run you could slow it down a
34:06 little bit
34:07 how many of you saw poltergeist from
34:09 1982
34:11 there is a scene where there's like a
34:13 ghostly character i'll put it in there
34:16 put in the video and that was shot
34:20 under water it was a ghost character
34:23 that had really flowing clothing you
34:25 know and it was shot under water
34:27 but then it was high conned and and
34:29 overlaid on top of the
34:31 the principal footage so it looked like
34:33 a ghost
34:34 icon just meaning whatever super
34:36 bright's the only thing that survives
34:37 the exposure change
34:39 and so then that bleeds on top of your
34:41 photo that is of a normal hallway
34:44 well why did they do that because they
34:46 wanted an angelic flowing
34:48 of the clothing
34:52 to just kind of flap in the wind you
34:53 know so
34:55 when our astronauts want to be messing
34:57 around opening a bag with some
34:59 instruments in it and
35:00 it's it's like moving around a little
35:02 bit it makes sense
35:05 to the uneducated eye the other one
35:09 is what we call water bubbles so the
35:12 chinese have their own thing going up in
35:14 space
35:15 when they do their space walks they have
35:17 made they're using the same technique
35:19 and they have blatant mistakes
35:23 so now imagine that you're going to pull
35:25 this hoax the way i'm talking
35:27 you build this huge tank you've got all
35:28 the lights you have a complete replicant
35:31 replica of the space station underwater
35:35 now just think about it you got a
35:36 football field size object so that
35:38 tank's going to be gigantic
35:40 but 6.5 million we double that to
35:43 potentially
35:45 12 million gallons you probably would
35:47 have enough space
35:49 now for those of you worried about light
35:51 refraction we're definitely going to
35:52 have to re
35:53 address that because if that's a screen
35:57 if well potentially any light that you
36:00 see
36:00 if the water were to get dense enough
36:03 and move around enough
36:04 you're going to get distortion in
36:06 objects you know you'd see that kind of
36:08 sort of thing happen
36:09 so it's going to have to be a very
36:11 stabilized
36:12 flow of water there's not going to be
36:14 any jetties
36:16 sitting on the side renewing that water
36:17 that water is going to have to be
36:20 sterilized in an off camera moment then
36:23 absolutely locked down from any
36:24 circulation whatsoever to make sure it
36:26 works right if this
36:27 if this hoaxy theory were to be true
36:31 the bubbles bubbles are seen
36:35 in multiple shots it's probably more
36:38 difficult to find it in 2020
36:40 especially with massive censorship and
36:42 video scraping
36:44 i'll do my best the best one i saw was a
36:47 chinese one where it was
36:48 most definitely a bubble on his blast
36:50 shield and it just hugged the
36:52 contour of his black shield and went up
36:54 and then flew off
36:56 and the american ones we don't see it as
36:59 often except we see renegade bubbles
37:01 which look like particles okay that are
37:04 flying off in various directions
37:06 i have seen them look more stable
37:09 meaning they're not changing their shape
37:11 that much and i've seen others where the
37:13 bubbles really kind of
37:14 real you know they're very tiny so you
37:17 really have an astute
37:19 eye on this thing other structural
37:22 engineers have asked a very important
37:23 question
37:24 now the space station is held together
37:27 by this
37:27 spine truss which is not inhabited by
37:30 anyone because it's much too small
37:33 but it's like a triangle trust as from
37:35 what i could gather from the images
37:36 and you know way off on the external
37:38 areas you have the solar panels that go
37:40 in both directions
37:42 and then in the center perpendicular to
37:44 the truss
37:45 you have all the modules hanging down
37:47 there with russia
37:49 on one end europe on the other and japan
37:52 attached to the end of europe's modules
37:56 now apparently there's 15 modules up
37:58 there and the goal was to have 20.
38:01 some of the modules over time have been
38:03 deprecated because they were duplicates
38:05 of other modules that other countries
38:06 came up with
38:08 and some were just waiting for funding
38:09 to get up there and get connected to the
38:11 system
38:13 the idea that you would leave a rover on
38:16 mars
38:17 and operate it for 20 years and then
38:20 the space station gets just gets
38:22 complete and you defunded in 2025
38:25 should tell you about how ludicrous this
38:27 thing is if it is ever defunded
38:29 it is because it has grown to be such a
38:31 mechanical liability
38:34 for the hoax side of things that they
38:37 don't want it there anymore
38:39 there would be no reason to
38:42 not continue to attach things to this
38:44 until it is the thing in uh
38:46 that luke bason movie right where it's
38:48 this gigantic spaceship
38:50 and that movie is named so horribly
38:51 something of a thousand cities or
38:53 something
38:55 valerion something like that what a bad
38:58 name oh my god
39:00 the movie's got so many cool things to
39:02 it too but the other one
39:04 are the astronauts now when you go back
39:07 inside
39:08 and you go look at the promo reel that
39:11 was invented i think about
39:12 94 or sorry 84
39:16 probably somewhere between 84 94. i
39:18 found a video which was the promo reel
39:20 selling the whole concept to congress
39:22 and probably the other countries
39:24 when they showed the interior of this
39:27 space station
39:28 it is generally the same exact shape and
39:30 same exact color scheme on the wall i
39:32 noticed because i then fast forwarded to
39:34 the one that
39:34 they claim is the one and it's the same
39:36 thing except
39:39 those complaints that we had made in the
39:40 first episode of this
39:42 that this place is a [ __ ] sorry for
39:45 the language
39:46 it is it is crap everywhere
39:50 constantly as if these astronauts are
39:52 just
39:53 incapable of being anything but feral
39:55 it's unbelievable
39:56 but the original design for that space
39:58 station looks just like
40:00 a netflix space station in some sci-fi
40:02 movie it was clean
40:04 it was organized and how they just
40:07 simply said oh yeah let's just attach a
40:08 laptop here laptop their laptop here
40:10 there's
40:11 you know i don't get it the other big
40:13 criticism is that they wear civilian
40:15 clothing while they're up there
40:18 big sweaters
40:21 um they don't have any
40:24 regiment for their hair so like my hair
40:28 really long hair i could just supposedly
40:30 go all over the space station floating
40:32 around whatever my hair's coming off you
40:34 know
40:34 because it does over time right
40:38 and someone else is talking to someone
40:40 else not about that
40:41 about it you know what a worry and all
40:44 sudden hair goes in my mouth
40:46 which is just even if it's your own hair
40:48 it's gross but let alone someone else's
40:50 hair growing your mouth
40:50 that's not nice plus
40:54 hair always comes out of everyone's head
40:55 constantly that's just the process you
40:56 just grow it back faster then you lose
40:58 it most of the time
40:59 and so you got little tiny hairs moving
41:01 everywhere clarence thomas my god
41:02 imagine that guy up there
41:04 but all your little hairs that people
41:06 aren't supposed to ever interact with
41:07 they're everywhere
41:08 [Music]
41:11 yeah hairs can also get into electronic
41:15 components
41:16 and create a short they can
41:20 they carry electricity if you got enough
41:23 going around
41:24 so that doesn't make any sense to me big
41:28 fibrous sweaters now every single time
41:31 you ever watch any space
41:32 travel show everybody on the ship is
41:35 wearing a jumpsuit
41:37 jumpsuits can be extremely comfortable
41:40 they're very protective you could put
41:42 different layers of protection on them
41:45 big dune suit or something like that you
41:47 know
41:48 so that seems completely suspect the
41:51 other thing is that when we see
41:53 the females and there's all kinds of
41:56 videos of
41:58 there's the blonde that washed her hair
42:00 there's the brunette lady
42:03 who will be in those group chats that
42:05 they do up there
42:07 and it's it's painfully apparent
42:11 that her hair has been spray hair
42:14 sprayed up to be gigantic
42:17 to create the effect for the little
42:19 kitties that they're in zero gravity
42:21 at no point could it just be like my
42:23 hair right now but perhaps just a few
42:25 fibers you know
42:26 kind of floating a little bit but
42:27 overall you don't want to look like a
42:30 clown do you
42:30 do you really want to look like a clown
42:32 seriously
42:34 why do we have hair nets as mandatory
42:38 you know clothing at restaurants for the
42:41 chefs for the short order cooks that
42:42 might have longer hair hell even if they
42:44 don't have longer hair half the time
42:45 they wear them
42:46 because we don't want hair in our food
42:49 and that's in normal gravity
42:50 let alone this stuff floating around so
42:54 that's suspect
42:56 now they do have to live a long time up
42:57 there but again do you need to make a
42:59 fashion statement
43:00 in space is that really is your ego more
43:03 important than a space mission being
43:04 safe
43:05 i don't think so doesn't make any sense
43:09 they could make these jumpsuits for the
43:10 girls differently than they make it for
43:12 the boys they could even have two or
43:13 three different kinds per sex
43:15 just in case someone's morbidly obese
43:17 and they want to actually pay the
43:19 the 2x price to push someone in space
43:21 whatever
43:22 make it comfortable for them but make it
43:25 controlled
43:26 you want to be in space you either have
43:28 to shave that head down or you're going
43:29 to have to wear something over your head
43:32 preferably you're going to have to have
43:33 short hair just sorry
43:36 we can't have this crap floating around
43:37 and little bonnet you're going to wear
43:39 on your head
43:40 it doesn't want to
43:44 contain a gigantic like a a gyna
43:48 hairdo right whoopi goldberg on freaking
43:50 star trek
43:52 because you're gonna need to move around
43:54 right what if you had an emergency
43:56 a fire and here you have this gigantic
43:59 hair
44:00 then you're contributing like the
44:02 burning bush to the whole puzzle
44:04 what if someone needs to come up behind
44:05 you to assist you in doing something
44:08 but your hair is in their face you're
44:11 slowing down the process of a rescue
44:13 you're slowing down the process of
44:14 accessing potentially another computer
44:16 because your hair is right in their face
44:19 no way on earth is nasa going to take
44:21 those risks in my opinion they're just
44:23 not going to do it
44:25 not because somebody goes out it doesn't
44:26 seem to bother anybody oh okay
44:29 but we'll just wait till it bothers you
44:31 and then this multi-billion dollar thing
44:33 in space
44:34 just i don't know explodes uh the space
44:36 program gets halted for five years
44:39 uh you know whatever no one's gonna take
44:41 those risks
44:44 so now the other thing is sort of the
44:46 funny funny joke of what the hell
44:48 are they doing up there all right now
44:51 see i had to put my hair up because
44:52 an 80 degree warm front is coming in
44:56 and it's blowing the wind
45:00 see i'm keeping the show on track by
45:02 taking care of my floppy mess here
45:06 now as i mentioned in my uh some recent
45:09 episodes
45:11 towards the end of last season a friend
45:13 of mine went off on a journey to try and
45:15 find
45:16 you know all the evidence of
45:19 fakery on this space station and one of
45:22 them had the brunette lady
45:24 doing a full tour of the entire capsule
45:29 and i would say apparently if i remember
45:31 right
45:33 the shot was fairly continuous
45:36 she is moving in all axis
45:39 of movement so x y z
45:44 not seemingly having any issues
45:47 and then it came to my attention of
45:50 some of the special effects that were
45:51 actually in 2001 and a lot of more
45:53 recent productions but they're reusing
45:55 the 2001 trick
45:57 which is when you want someone to float
46:02 100 in the center of a fuselage type
46:05 capsule right one of these
46:07 modules what you do
46:10 is you put the capsule on its side so
46:13 one of the sides is
46:14 up and one of the sides is down but then
46:17 you take the video camera which is your
46:18 full perspective of reality
46:20 and you shoot the things straight up and
46:23 so what ends up happening is these
46:24 individuals
46:25 fall into the capsule on a tether which
46:28 has got all kinds of
46:30 pulleys and computer-controlled systems
46:33 that know how much you weigh to the
46:35 ounce
46:36 and it makes sure that you don't suffer
46:37 any major adjustments
46:39 in your speed to look like you're
46:41 hanging on a wire
46:42 your harness is is really wrapped around
46:46 your body
46:47 underneath your clothing that you might
46:49 have on
46:51 so other than a violent stop it's not
46:53 going to be a huge thing for you
46:56 but we know that when you're hanging if
46:58 you're not wearing a space helmet which
47:00 is usually what hollywood puts you in
47:01 the scenario of
47:03 you know that there's a stress on your
47:04 face when you're looking down at a
47:06 camera
47:07 and you're actually upside down because
47:09 all that blood rushes from your feet to
47:10 your head
47:11 every vein in your head starts popping
47:13 out
47:14 so i can't say that i saw anything of
47:17 that nature
47:18 when this woman was doing the tour now
47:20 it's weird during this whole thing is
47:24 that
47:26 she takes you to the areas where
47:27 experiments are being done and it looks
47:29 like an absolute
47:30 joke i have seen kids science
47:34 fairs and gymnasiums with more
47:37 mechanical equipment doing more
47:39 interesting things than any of the
47:41 experiments i've ever seen in the space
47:42 station
47:43 almost like it's a party up there
47:47 to just mess around the other thing is
47:50 in your entire lifetime
47:51 what what's ever coming to your kitchen
47:53 or your car or in your hospital
47:55 that was figured out in space
47:58 whatever experiments they've been doing
48:00 up there where's the results maybe you
48:03 know maybe there's something there i
48:04 don't know
48:06 there's another video which is very very
48:09 telling
48:10 and you know the thing is is like once
48:11 you have a smoking gun
48:14 where you caught them lying then
48:17 you never can reset back to totally
48:19 believing what's going on
48:21 and this one video which i don't know if
48:24 i can
48:25 legally put it in this video but it's a
48:27 russian guy i think
48:29 he's doing a demo for his people and
48:32 he's showing how the bathroom i think
48:35 worked
48:36 and there was a little nut that was on a
48:39 panel
48:41 and he's trying to move this panel and
48:43 the nut
48:44 fell real time on camera you could hear
48:47 it hit the ground
48:48 and go and he's like oh man oh and he
48:51 looks at the camera like oh
48:53 now i think initially it's i just
48:57 dropped a
48:58 nut off of a screw off a fitting and now
49:01 i got to go find
49:02 it oopsy doopsy because that's what you
49:04 would do here on earth you know i
49:05 would say i had a you know car repair
49:08 youtube channel instead of this one and
49:09 i drop a screw or i'm doing some
49:11 electronics repair and you drop that
49:13 little nut down inside the computer like
49:14 ah [ __ ] you know
49:17 all right but i think the other thing
49:19 was that he noticed eventually in
49:21 microseconds that he just blew the
49:23 illusion of being in 3d
49:26 he blew the illusion that he was in zero
49:29 gravity
49:30 now how would they fake weightlessness
49:33 on camera
49:34 because they do these long interviews
49:35 where they're kind of you know bumping
49:36 around and stuff
49:37 well we know we could create some some
49:40 exorcist beds
49:42 where whatever they're they're actually
49:43 sitting on something and it's sort of
49:46 you know modulating everyone's butt and
49:48 so everyone's got the illusion that's
49:50 cool the chicks got her hair all hair
49:51 sprayed up
49:53 the dudes maybe have some augmented
49:55 reality object or a little fluffy thing
49:57 on a string
49:58 that you can't see all right you could
50:00 do those
50:02 one of the big theories is that these
50:04 modules
50:06 are have been specifically designed to
50:08 fit inside the fuselage
50:09 of a jumbo jet and we have
50:13 services that we know of called the
50:15 vomit rocket service where
50:17 they initially train astronauts on these
50:19 vomit rockets they still do
50:20 but you can buy a ticket on a vomit
50:23 rocket and
50:24 i'm not sure what the um the overall
50:27 altitude is
50:28 i've heard it's about a 60-second drop
50:31 now one in a matter of
50:34 nasa and astronauts and this important
50:36 endeavor could probably move that
50:38 ship even further up so that maybe you
50:41 get two minutes or whatever
50:43 but that this thing can drop down
50:45 everyone goes weightless
50:47 and then you know your weightlessness is
50:49 pretty steady
50:50 now when you see the the videos of this
50:52 uh the pedestrians doing this
50:55 they're trying to move as much as they
50:57 possibly can in the 60 seconds because
50:59 they're never going to get a chance to
51:00 do it again
51:02 maybe do four or five drops in a day but
51:05 that's it once they're done
51:06 they probably will never buy another
51:07 ticket so they're going crazy all over
51:09 the ship
51:10 and that's why so don't get that
51:12 difference between their
51:14 recreational use of zero g and someone
51:17 trying to stage
51:18 an event for the sake of
51:22 validating the iss but there was an
51:24 interesting video
51:26 where there must have been i think it
51:28 was damn near everyone that was in the
51:31 iss at one point it was like six to
51:34 eight
51:34 guys i don't know if any girls were
51:37 there probably
51:39 but they had this little microphone
51:40 they're passing around talking on right
51:42 they pass it around
51:43 pass it around which in itself
51:46 doesn't that seem insane you can put a
51:49 microphone in a room like the one on
51:51 this camera and everyone's going to have
51:52 their
51:54 voices heard haven't you done a
51:55 conference call with people is there a
51:57 super mic
51:57 on your chest no you're just talking to
51:59 your computer and it works fine
52:00 this is nasa okay they can they can
52:04 use microphones pretty good right but
52:07 they're passing around this microphone
52:08 and here's what was happening in the in
52:10 the
52:10 video you may have to go watch this
52:13 yourself because i don't want to get the
52:14 video struck
52:15 out of existence for copyright reasons
52:18 when they pass the mic to the dudes in
52:20 the center of this
52:21 crowd and then it's it's
52:24 uh faded on you would hear
52:28 his voice and then maybe a little bit of
52:30 background noise
52:32 not too much but when they pass the mic
52:34 to a dude right on the edge of this
52:36 capsule
52:38 and that dude talks but all of a sudden
52:41 you hear
52:42 what sounds like jet engines
52:47 it's a wild rumbling noise
52:50 and so the question is is why would that
52:54 be now nasa could make up a thousand
52:55 reasons they could say okay
52:57 uh you know the heating system went on
53:00 so that's what you're hearing
53:01 but then my heater never sounds like a
53:03 jet engine it just doesn't
53:06 but when would they have to fake
53:07 anything
53:09 when does the proof have to show up in
53:12 terms of
53:13 believable footage well it would be
53:16 an an organized event where you're going
53:19 to talk to people on earth
53:21 that's really it because every other
53:23 thing that we've talked about where
53:25 they're creating their own little videos
53:26 and then broadcasting it down
53:28 to earth those can be created in a
53:30 studio at whatever time interval they
53:32 want
53:33 and send it down to you the other thing
53:35 that i want to mention before we go too
53:37 much further because i'll forget
53:39 is that depending on your intelligence
53:41 depending on how much
53:42 anyone's ever tried to pull the wool
53:44 over your eyes
53:46 which i don't even know what that means
53:47 but uh apparently that's bad
53:50 there's just something kind of built
53:53 into these individuals
53:55 again what would an astronaut be in the
53:58 modern age
54:00 used to be that you had to be a top gun
54:02 pilot you were a gus grissom dude
54:05 you could watch him fly
54:09 amazingly uh perfect in a plane or you
54:12 could watch him
54:13 probably knock you out one punch at a
54:15 bar these are big dudes
54:17 all american guys cowboys and if you're
54:19 not from america you need to understand
54:20 there's sort of a code of ethic that
54:22 usually travels with these individuals
54:25 save any threats to their lives right
54:29 obviously they don't want to have a
54:30 situation where they're constantly
54:32 having to threaten this living crap out
54:33 of all these astronauts just to have
54:35 someone participate
54:37 russia not such a problem because
54:40 they're all for country
54:41 the hoax would be of course they do this
54:43 for mother russia you know it makes us
54:45 look good
54:47 in america all you gotta do is find
54:49 sociopathic nerds
54:51 folks that have had a hard time treated
54:53 like crap and now
54:54 just like danny devito in the episode of
54:56 taxi where he wants to get back at all
54:58 of his friends and at his class reunion
55:01 and he was afraid that becoming a cab
55:03 drive dispatcher wasn't going to be good
55:05 enough he sends a buddy off to play him
55:08 at the reunion
55:12 these dudes get to do the ultimate go to
55:15 space
55:16 we know the integrity of astronauts is
55:18 not that great because we had one of
55:20 them
55:21 a female try to kill another female at a
55:24 bar in florida
55:26 just because of some infidelity thing
55:28 all right that's that's pretty heavy
55:29 duty man
55:30 you cheated on me i'm gonna shoot you in
55:32 the head
55:34 but there's just something about about
55:35 at least 50 percent of the guys i saw
55:37 yesterday while i was reviewing a ton of
55:38 videos
55:40 these guys are telling you all about it
55:41 you either have a google-eyed person who
55:44 probably would believe anything and then
55:45 you have that dude it's just a
55:46 squirmy-wormy dude
55:48 there's plenty of them but now let's
55:50 talk about the design
55:53 of the international space
55:56 station i say that slowly so you'll
55:59 remember this is supposed to be
56:04 a capsule capsulized
56:07 station in space to study space
56:10 the most damning thing about this entire
56:13 situation
56:15 me it is the
56:18 smoking gun of all smoking guns that
56:21 this thing
56:22 is not what they say it is it may or may
56:25 not be up there maybe they used a prop
56:27 you know and threw it by this
56:28 the moon but let's just say something's
56:30 up there
56:32 the only window out of this place
56:36 meant for observation is pointed at
56:39 earth
56:40 not space one would assume
56:46 that there would also be that you
56:48 definitely won't want to look at earth
56:49 for sure
56:50 but you'd also have another one on the
56:52 opposite side remember what is the
56:54 millennium falcon
56:55 you could go down that tube and there's
56:57 a gun up there and
56:58 there's a gun down below so you can
56:59 shoot above and below the millennium
57:01 falcon
57:01 that made sense right come on guys just
57:04 just rip off from star wars you love
57:06 ripping off every other sci-fi movie
57:08 that exists
57:10 but you got this astronaut playing you
57:12 know
57:14 david bowie got his guitar
57:19 i mean it's great they get recreation
57:21 man you're up there going nuts in some
57:23 cabin fever environment so i understand
57:25 recreation i don't have any problem with
57:26 that whatsoever
57:28 but what's uh what's the other way right
57:31 what's the other way
57:34 well the moon is right there and
57:36 apparently with no atmosphere
57:38 oxygenated atmosphere
57:41 wouldn't that be an awesome thing what
57:43 if just imagine okay let's just say this
57:47 this gives you the lunacy of this entire
57:49 situation
57:51 let's say we wake up one day
57:54 and you look at your telephone you're
57:55 expecting a bunch of city politics
57:58 and you don't you see every rag on earth
58:01 talking about a giant mother ship that's
58:04 landing
58:04 on the moon and everybody can see it you
58:07 can
58:08 almost see it with your naked eye you
58:10 see this reflection up there at least
58:12 with your naked eye
58:13 guess who they can't call
58:17 to get a good image of this thing they
58:20 can't call
58:20 the international space station to get a
58:23 picture
58:24 into space because there ain't no
58:27 windows up there
58:28 pointing the other direction i was
58:31 hell-bent to find
58:32 any evidence of a telescope on this
58:34 thing
58:36 oh let's rewind here let's rewind here
58:39 right
58:41 you have supposedly in 1993 i believe is
58:44 the year
58:45 the hubble telescope is launched into
58:47 space there's no record of it launching
58:49 in the international database of
58:51 objects in space the only thing that's
58:56 in the database are space shuttle
58:57 missions to fix the thing because
58:59 it didn't work right can we borrow from
59:01 our mars mission thing
59:03 what's the mars mission model the
59:05 business model
59:06 pictures they're selling you pictures
59:08 right
59:09 all right so maybe
59:12 those hubble telescope images weren't
59:14 ready the sofia
59:16 system wasn't ready they couldn't find
59:18 anything interesting to take a picture
59:19 of with sophia
59:20 so then tubble can't work so create this
59:22 contingency that
59:24 oh you know we had a mechanical problem
59:30 all right guys but imagine that you
59:33 couldn't use a space station to look at
59:35 the moon
59:37 why not launch some really cool
59:40 super versatile hubble telescope upgrade
59:45 into space attach it to the top
59:48 of the um space station on some really
59:52 cool swivel
59:54 and then you can control that thing in
59:55 all all degrees i mean just look at the
59:58 b
59:59 17 bombers the b-52 bombers
60:03 they have that you know that turret in
60:04 the bottom which is awesome you saw it
60:05 in the movie heavy metal
60:08 let's get something going
60:11 the problem is is every single time they
60:13 commit to revealing
60:15 something about space then they have to
60:18 get a group of individuals to render
60:20 something in cg
60:21 so that you can believe that this is
60:23 actually working
60:24 or they'd have to use the observatory in
60:28 germany
60:28 which happened to release the same
60:30 footage of jupiter that sofia released
60:33 that then the hubble telescope released
60:35 all in the same day and that's when we
60:36 found out the hubble telescope was
60:38 probably
60:39 not up there and not what they say
60:40 because they've been faking it with a
60:42 system here on earth
60:44 so what is the space station if it
60:46 weren't if it weren't real
60:48 okay it might be real i don't know why
60:51 they're having such a problem
60:53 traveling without harnesses in my
60:54 opinion if i were working for nasa i
60:57 would have told
60:59 i would have suggested that the plan
61:02 that says the following
61:04 we are going to wear harnesses on camera
61:06 every single time we're on film
61:09 for the mere fact that it's a safety
61:11 protocol
61:12 for having more than two people in one
61:15 space in a zero-g
61:16 environment we want everyone to stay in
61:18 the same spot so
61:20 right there on the edge of the capsule
61:23 you just buckle in
61:24 and you chain yourself to you know your
61:26 partner next to you and they buckle into
61:27 the wall on the other side and
61:28 everybody's in place with the camera
61:30 chute
61:30 and these harnesses are in view now you
61:32 can use the harnesses to create the fake
61:34 zero g
61:35 environment but you're also blowing it
61:38 off
61:38 that it's necessary now they do have
61:40 these little
61:43 sort of plates on the ground where you
61:44 can stick your foot underneath
61:46 this plate to hold you in place
61:49 makes sense sounds good they can also
61:52 double as handles if you're
61:53 moving through the capsule really fast
61:55 but now let's think about this whole
61:57 idea of
61:58 that fun little thing they do all the
62:01 time where
62:02 they go zooming through the capsule
62:05 what happens if you miss the handle
62:10 you're hauling ass you're probably going
62:13 5 to 10 miles an hour
62:14 i'd say on a good yank to go through one
62:17 of these
62:18 capsules obviously you're getting you
62:21 get good with it
62:22 uh get better with it over time remember
62:25 they're
62:26 places of crap hole there are laptops
62:28 everywhere sticking out
62:30 there's just junk everywhere inside this
62:32 thing
62:33 and you're going to pull yourself
62:34 through this capsule at 10 miles an hour
62:37 what's going to stop you nothing the
62:40 atmosphere in there is very very light
62:43 it is oxygenated as earth is oxygenated
62:46 supposedly
62:46 they didn't want a pure oxygenated
62:48 environment apparently their oxygen is
62:51 generated through
62:52 burning various elements and releasing
62:56 oxygen into the system plus they also
62:59 metabolize all the co2
63:01 that the astronauts exhale in terms of
63:04 energy
63:05 well the solar panel should be able to
63:07 handle it
63:09 even just a nuclear module the nuclear
63:11 power plant module being up there would
63:13 handle it
63:13 really easily but okay so this guy's
63:17 gonna pull himself through and just on
63:18 that particular day
63:20 maybe he's had a little bit of uh vodka
63:24 and uh i don't know if they let him
63:25 drink up there or not
63:27 but for whatever reason he just makes a
63:28 mistake someone moves the laptop
63:30 that wasn't there and so the dude's
63:32 relying on the fact that this is an
63:34 empty area that he can move through but
63:36 now
63:37 some dude's bald head gets jammed into
63:39 some part of
63:40 a computer he bumps his head he totally
63:43 misses the bar and so he slams into the
63:45 wall
63:46 with his head at 10 miles an hour
63:50 now you have a medical emergency
63:53 a medical emergency on a space station
63:56 all right now what what are you gonna do
64:00 you realize the millions the tens of
64:02 millions and the hundreds of millions of
64:03 dollars it would take
64:05 to get this guy out of a of some sort of
64:07 brain swelling concussion that might
64:09 kill him the older you are the
64:13 longer it takes to heal now these people
64:16 are vetted for
64:17 amazing physiques and what have you but
64:19 a bump on the head's a bump on the head
64:20 man
64:22 so that seems suspect another
64:25 amazing spacewalk problem that i just
64:27 learned yesterday
64:28 which remember how i told you that
64:30 there's this theory that it's a big
64:31 water tank now if you
64:36 thought that sounded amazing to the
64:38 degree you think that sounds
64:40 ridiculous you're like oh my god this
64:42 guy's a total [ __ ]
64:44 one of the most dangerous situations
64:46 that occurred i think it was a french
64:47 dude
64:48 but this dude's doing a spacewalk he's
64:50 leaving the module
64:53 he gets out there and he starts to
64:56 report
64:58 that he has water coming inside of his
65:00 spacesuit
65:02 now for some reason they said some sort
65:04 of
65:05 bag they just gloss over the fact it's
65:07 some sort of bag in his
65:08 suit that's full of enough water that
65:11 this guy's helmet's starting to fill up
65:12 with water
65:13 and the dude's starting to drown in
65:16 space
65:17 and one of these guys made a joke it
65:19 wouldn't be funny how you know if you
65:21 died in space
65:22 by drowning it would be really strange
65:24 right
65:25 i think what happened was the seal on
65:28 his suit broke
65:29 the environment started to leak in on
65:31 his spacesuit and he was drowning
65:33 because
65:34 that's the environment that he's in we
65:37 just blow this stuff
65:38 off because we don't have a clue that
65:41 water is being used as the medium
65:43 to shoot all these outside shots
65:47 the other big one for a lot of you is
65:50 that when every time you see earth
65:51 in the shots from an eva exercise
65:55 earth is really super duper round
65:59 but they're only 250 miles up
66:03 so if you want to know how far they are
66:05 off the earth take 250 and divide it by
66:09 7 900 and then move the decimal place
66:12 2 to the right that's the percentage
66:16 distance off the surface of the earth
66:18 that they are
66:19 they're barely off the surface of the
66:21 earth which means it's going to be
66:23 super flat it'll just be a big disc and
66:25 it's not going to be super round
66:29 because they're near the equator as they
66:30 do this rotation
66:32 and it moves at 17 000 miles an hour
66:34 that number i always quote
66:37 now the interesting thing about the
66:40 space station
66:41 in terms of what is it really let's say
66:43 it was really there
66:44 i'm not convinced it's really there but
66:47 what if it was really there then what
66:48 would it be used for
66:50 but the most cynical idea i could
66:51 possibly come up with is it's a little
66:53 epstein island in space
66:54 that's why millionaires buy tickets to
66:56 go up and visit the place
66:59 as far as a low-hanging idea why they
67:02 wouldn't
67:03 really be there why they would need to
67:05 fake this
67:06 this rotating you know doll
67:11 that doesn't make sense to me why would
67:14 you have to fake anything
67:15 why would a guy fly by on a harness why
67:17 would the guy doing the flip have a
67:18 harness on his clothes and they
67:20 don't acknowledge that that's actually
67:21 occurring wow this fakery
67:24 i can't figure it out unless the thing
67:27 is simply not
67:28 there they did have something in the air
67:31 that flew by the moon my buddy's got
67:34 shots of it
67:35 so if that's if it's really there or if
67:38 it's not there
67:39 and this shot came through then they
67:40 figured out a way to move something
67:42 extremely fast through space for a brief
67:45 evening to convince everybody it was
67:48 there
67:50 i don't think i have any problem with
67:52 him figuring out how to do it even if we
67:54 can't
67:54 quite put our finger on it and i forgot
67:57 to finish my point about the structural
67:59 engineer
68:01 one of the structural engineers was
68:02 doing some basic physics on
68:06 what it would be like to create a
68:09 transverse wave of movement of energy
68:12 through the space station what that
68:14 means is
68:16 somebody bumps into a wall moves
68:19 stop stomps whatever and as soon as you
68:22 hit
68:24 a structure with force you have
68:26 transferred energy from your body into
68:28 the structure
68:29 and then that energy will move through
68:31 the structure and to the degree of the
68:33 structure is
68:34 grounded it will cancel the wave and
68:36 you're good
68:37 that's why skyscrapers do really well in
68:40 earthquakes and windy environments
68:42 because
68:42 they can always ground themselves to the
68:44 earth that they're
68:45 they're pounded into but when you're in
68:48 space
68:49 you're not grounded anything so one of
68:52 the guys asserted and i'm not a
68:54 structural engineer so i
68:55 do not know how to access this a
68:58 software or
68:59 simulation maybe if some of you are it'd
69:01 be great to hear your take on this
69:05 but what they theorized was that this
69:07 wave would simply just keep moving
69:08 around the ship and to the point it
69:10 would start to augment
69:11 with every other bump that's going on
69:14 compounding this wave to the point the
69:17 ship would tear itself apart
69:18 just by sheer movement
69:22 i don't know if i buy that i can see
69:26 where that could
69:27 have legs but i i don't know
69:30 now there was so there have been i
69:32 should say
69:35 moments where anomalies occur where
69:39 at one point the uh the
69:42 solar panels were being extended and
69:44 re-extended what have you
69:45 and it actually in the extending
69:48 sequence ripped apart like two things
69:50 got
69:50 caught together and when it moved it
69:52 ripped the
69:53 solar panel a little bit that was due to
69:56 apparently nothing hitting it but there
70:00 was a point where they said that they
70:02 thought that a space rock went through
70:07 one side of the capsule and they were
70:09 losing pressure and something was
70:11 leaking and supposedly they covered it
70:13 with some tape
70:14 and then eventually did an eva and
70:16 patched it from the outside
70:18 the problem with that theory that it's a
70:20 rock going through the space station
70:22 is it only pierced one edge of one
70:25 module
70:26 if a rock is traveling unrestricted in
70:29 space
70:30 and it made impact with the spaceship
70:33 it's going to penetrate all the way
70:34 through
70:35 in one vector go through one side and
70:38 through the other
70:38 instantaneously there shouldn't be a
70:40 point where you have
70:42 one hole in the capsule
70:46 because even if it went down the
70:47 lengthwise it would start ripping bodies
70:49 apart and turning people inside out
70:51 as it's going through and then it'll pop
70:52 out the other side
70:54 it's going so fast it's like a railgun
70:58 you've seen these ceramic pucks that are
71:01 shot through
71:02 you know one foot of lead and it turns
71:04 the lead into liquid
71:06 and the puck is still going it's worse
71:09 than that in space
71:11 remember though sandra bullock movie
71:12 gravity
71:14 with george clooney what is the premise
71:17 of that movie well you got a space
71:19 station in space
71:21 and a real meteor shower starts to come
71:23 in and just rip this thing to shreds
71:28 again my physics teacher told me in high
71:30 school
71:31 that at any one moment in time
71:36 the earth absorbs 100 million
71:40 little tiny meteorites per minute
71:43 100 million now it's it's a big ball man
71:45 it's huge
71:46 100 million sounds like a lot and it is
71:48 a lot
71:49 but that space station being up there in
71:51 any form since 1995
71:53 all the way till today should have
71:55 suffered many
71:57 of these penetrations once nasa figures
72:00 out
72:01 the frequency of these penetrations
72:03 sitting in space with a space shuttle or
72:05 anything doesn't make any sense because
72:07 at any point in time this thing should
72:09 be shredded by a bunch of microscopic
72:11 rocks
72:12 let alone a big one like the one that
72:14 flew in over russia
72:16 blew out windows and stuff
72:19 of course it's important to mention that
72:21 their defense minister said that that
72:22 was a weapon
72:24 of the essential intelligence committee
72:26 or agency excuse me
72:28 and who knows that footage is really
72:31 strange because
72:32 someone did an analysis of that quote
72:35 unquote meteorite coming in over
72:38 russia and if you watch the footage
72:41 someone slowed it down
72:42 and you will see even though this thing
72:43 is going mock something or other
72:45 something else accelerates even faster
72:48 behind it and hits that core and as soon
72:50 as that thing that was going faster hits
72:51 the core that's when you get the giant
72:53 explosion
72:54 where all the windows blew out and
72:55 everybody freaked out
72:58 so i don't know if that's a weapon that
73:00 the russians had to knock this other
73:01 thing out of the sky
73:02 or if it's a ufo protecting things don't
73:06 know
73:07 they later said they found the core of
73:08 that meteorite in some
73:11 river lake down the way so i should say
73:14 lake
73:15 but then you that's it it's like you
73:16 don't hear anything else about it and
73:18 it's like come on guys
73:19 it's tint amount to recovering a ufo and
73:22 everyone gets to know that it was up
73:23 there and
73:24 it was recovered and then that's it you
73:26 don't get to hear about it i mean that
73:27 thing should be in a museum somewhere
73:30 now it's hard to sometimes sort out the
73:32 fiction versus the fact when you have
73:34 movies that set a precedence for what
73:36 could happen
73:37 and then you try to apply a movie to
73:39 reality and then someone taps you on
73:41 their shoulder and goes
73:42 dude that's not even real superman
73:43 flying backwards around the earth and
73:46 faster than speed lights not going to
73:47 actually make him travel back in time
73:50 that was just a comic book relax but
73:53 again
73:53 using all the knowledge that i have from
73:56 school
73:57 and books they are always talking about
74:00 these
74:01 constant shower of microscopic particles
74:05 and big little rocks you know like you
74:07 know about the size of a marble
74:10 coming into earth's atmosphere now we do
74:12 have the van allen belts which will cook
74:13 a lot of that stuff
74:15 but okay so you start out with a chevy
74:19 a size rock and then it burns down to
74:22 a baseball and now it's coming at the
74:24 space station
74:26 and again there's a lot of space and
74:28 space just look up you know
74:30 it's it's hard to uh coordinate in 3d
74:33 space up there
74:36 so is the space station real or is it
74:38 fake
74:40 if it's fake then the whole thing is
74:43 just localized on earth and it's just a
74:45 money laundering thing
74:47 for all the countries involved you tell
74:49 every country look man you're going to
74:50 build this little module
74:52 you're going to allocate x number of
74:54 millions of
74:55 dollars towards this project to keep the
74:57 module alive it's your contribution
75:00 and you're going to put all that in your
75:01 back pocket you're going to send it to
75:03 your friends you're going to
75:04 fund black ops things so it's just this
75:06 nice little
75:07 layer of fiction that facilitates
75:10 whatever the hell you want to do with
75:11 your money
75:12 that makes sense and i talked to bart
75:15 sabrel during that interview
75:17 and if you guys remember it i think it
75:18 was season three
75:21 you know his theory was that that there
75:23 are several space stations
75:25 up there and that this is just a ruse
75:28 for our brain
75:29 to make us think that we're so you know
75:32 remedial but the
75:33 what we really have up there is like an
75:35 armageddon kind of
75:37 armada of space stations everyone's got
75:39 one and
75:42 you know they're fighting space aliens
75:43 and they're traveling around and they're
75:45 flying the space shuttle shuttle like a
75:47 like a f1 race car
75:50 up there i don't believe any of that
75:54 at all i think we are far less advanced
75:57 in space travel than we think i do
76:00 believe that
76:02 star wars stuff is up there and for
76:06 those of you
76:07 on the fringe
76:10 where you think that the space space
76:12 itself doesn't exist
76:13 and you think it's a it's a blanket it's
76:15 a shield it's
76:16 up there for maybe entertainment
76:19 purposes or it's the firmament dome or
76:21 whatever
76:23 all those theories do not negate put
76:25 putting something
76:27 up there that can go in a circle if
76:29 you're a flat earther you believe the
76:30 sun and the moon are floating on a
76:32 buoyant layer of atmosphere well just
76:35 imagine them throwing it up there
76:37 same exact methodology and so it's going
76:40 in a circle around the disc it doesn't
76:42 prohibit
76:43 things from occurring but even in the
76:45 heliocentric realm
76:46 there's plenty of questions left so
76:50 hopefully that gives you enough
76:51 information to kind of ask questions
76:53 there are reels and reels of this
76:57 footage that is definitely faked for
76:59 sure
77:00 of interviews with fake objects
77:04 harnesses everywhere there are bubbles
77:07 in space
77:08 on space mass that just contour exactly
77:11 the way a bubble would move up a surface
77:15 again if you have an object that is
77:18 you know a piece of dust on something
77:21 and it kicks off it's going to just go
77:22 in that straight direction
77:24 bubbles though will have its tension in
77:26 the water and it will
77:28 tend to try to adhere to whatever
77:30 surface is next to it
77:32 that's what we see it might be very
77:35 difficult for me to find that footage
77:36 nowadays
77:37 because again we've had several scrapes
77:39 of all the videos
77:41 and again if you see a video i will just
77:44 tell you go get a
77:46 if you want to grab evidence of things
77:48 you see online
77:49 go get a product i think it's called
77:50 wondershare it's what i use on my
77:53 computer to bring down my own videos
77:55 once they're encoded in hd i bring them
77:56 down as sd and then upload them
77:58 or actually 4k to hd excuse me and then
78:01 i upload them to bid shoot
78:03 get that software once you have the url
78:06 of a video
78:07 you just paste it in that product it's a
78:09 beautiful interface it converts
78:11 videos it does audio it has everything
78:13 it's an amazing product
78:16 and it'll yank it down for you it
78:17 updates constantly because the
78:19 the the way that they build the web
78:21 pages changes and so the way that they
78:23 encode the videos changes so they're
78:25 always updating it to make sure that it
78:26 downloads properly and it hasn't let me
78:28 down yet but definitely get that product
78:29 so you can grab all the videos and then
78:31 maybe
78:32 there might be a point where i'm calling
78:33 out to you guys to
78:35 use your libraries to send them to me so
78:37 i can make the best video that's out
78:39 there
78:40 but anyway if you haven't been to
78:41 deepthoughtsradio.com please go and make
78:43 a short bumper today because it's hot as
78:45 hell out here today
78:47 we have everything you need up there
78:48 make sure you go up and join bid shoot
78:50 it seems to be the
78:52 solid replacement for youtube without
78:53 any censorship or
78:55 upload limitations i just want you to
78:57 know that
78:58 gab.tv has a one gigabyte limit even if
79:01 you pay for the pro service
79:03 and that's not enough to upload even a
79:05 single video of deep thoughts
79:07 you'd have to watch it at a postage
79:09 stamp size and i simply won't do that
79:10 and i do not have the time
79:12 to cut every video in half or into three
79:14 pieces and say part one part two part
79:16 three
79:17 if any of you uh want to do that you let
79:20 me know
79:22 anyway take care of yourself and someone
79:23 else and i'll see you on the next deep
79:25 thoughts
79:34 over
79:37 [Music]
79:48 so
79:52 [Applause]
79:58 [Music]
80:03 you
