00:29 good evening ladies and gentlemen
00:31 welcome back to deep thoughts today I'm
00:36 kind of torn it's actually not so cold
00:37 out tonight and let's see see how cold
00:42 it is 57 a guy feels like summer out
00:45 here I want to talk about NASA that's
00:50 what I really want to talk about but I
00:53 think we can make it slightly more
00:55 psychological at the same time because
01:02 it's such an interesting experience
01:06 you know if I'll put it this way gosh
01:09 it's hard to put this into words right
01:11 at the beginning here I don't even know
01:14 I'm gonna call this episode so you know
01:16 more than me at this point
01:17 what would we be like as human beings if
01:20 we believed - all the [ __ ] that we
01:22 were told just all of it just everyone
01:25 tells the truth governments tell the
01:27 truth political parties tell the truth
01:29 corporations tell the truth individuals
01:31 tell the truth preachers tell the truth
01:33 well hold our world be like if we all
01:36 were complicit and followed the rules
01:39 and I'll tell you where we'd be 97 to 99
01:45 percent of us would be dead because they
01:49 would have already gotten rid of us one
01:51 way or the other other sterilized us or
01:53 you know so have any more kids well I
01:55 haven't even had any we'll see you've
01:57 already had too many you know the fact
01:59 that you exist means your parents had
02:01 too many well I'm only had one child my
02:03 parents reduced world population well
02:04 you know what they should have stopped
02:05 all those guns you don't need those guns
02:08 guns kill people all by themselves right
02:11 but let's just a maybe we give ourselves
02:15 a little bit of backbone it really won't
02:18 exist a globalist 70 thing to do with it
02:20 I mean seriously your backbone your
02:22 fortitude to continue being free as a
02:25 person wouldn't be allowed that's
02:28 because you could stand up against them
02:30 but I give an example of that and we'll
02:33 see if we can get this back on track
02:35 imagine you
02:38 I mean if those of you saw Downton Abbey
02:39 those of you seen any show like the
02:42 crown or any other royalty rich people
02:45 show some people no train Butler's not
02:53 there's that there's a chamber lady or
02:55 something like that that's the female
02:56 version of that but there's an etiquette
02:58 that you don't talk to the master you
03:03 know if someone were to regardless of
03:06 how intelligent they might be it lets to
03:07 say they're very intelligent person but
03:09 let's just say the Queen's in their
03:10 little office there and doing Queenie
03:12 things and her trash cans full or it's
03:15 that day where it's gonna get cleaned
03:17 out and for some reason she's in there
03:21 they you know current etiquette is you
03:22 wouldn't go in there she was in there
03:24 all that stuff should be done before she
03:25 gets in the room but if things were a
03:27 little bit different and nice and sweet
03:29 she would go in there being able to
03:31 empty the trash and say how was your day
03:34 I'm not here to have a giant
03:36 conversation I'm just going to ask you
03:38 you having a good day if you aren't and
03:40 maybe I can say well hope things get
03:42 better but you can't you don't because
03:46 poor people aren't supposed to talk to
03:48 rich people right the class structure
03:51 system the NASA thing for me is just
03:55 fascinating because for a lot of us when
03:58 we talk about NASA frauds and that sort
04:00 of thing it's all rooted in like moon
04:03 mission things right
04:07 ISS fake footage you know the Hubble
04:11 telescope not being entered into the
04:13 international database of launched
04:14 vehicles in space which is the database
04:16 that tracks space trash right that's why
04:20 the database exists where you launching
04:22 this thing what orbits is gonna be in
04:23 how is it gonna be up in there okay and
04:26 so you put all your astrophysics in
04:29 there for orbital decay and then
04:31 database gets recalculating really just
04:33 generally keeps up with where these
04:35 vehicles are expecting you know
04:37 cooperation with the space agency that
04:39 owns it case they move it up a little
04:41 higher
04:41 you know we've moved it from 180 to 200
04:44 okay thanks man you know updated in the
04:46 database right so there's lies
04:51 know that that's why we explore this
04:53 whole topic but now what else is NASA
04:58 represent to some people I just met a
05:01 really nice gentleman who has a past at
05:04 NASA I haven't talked to him and
05:05 interviewing him by any means but he's
05:07 very sweet guy very intelligent and it
05:11 you know I might be working with this
05:13 guy soon in a whole different capacity
05:17 and I realized that if I participate in
05:21 this project
05:23 they'll come a point where you know my
05:26 belief system of NASA and his belief
05:28 system NASA is going to - I wouldn't say
05:33 clash or conflict or conflict with each
05:35 other but there'll be definitely a
05:39 different level of respect for the
05:41 institution of course and so on and so
05:44 forth and then you want to make sure
05:46 that it's not a surprise that an
05:49 individual so if I ever do start working
05:52 with them on a daily basis I would have
05:54 to find the right time to kind of say
05:57 well you know dude I don't want you to
05:58 find this out through watching YouTube
06:02 videos or someone send you an email I
06:03 want you to learn it for me and that way
06:05 you can ask me any questions you want
06:06 and we'll go through it and I also want
06:09 to talk about probably more sexy topic
06:12 would be which you know I guess the
06:14 first agenda would be to really kind of
06:17 isolate the what NASA represents to an
06:20 average NASA fanboy because that'll be
06:23 the conversation and the elements that
06:26 you end up discussing if you're if
06:30 you're lucky or argue over if it's a
06:33 typical interaction depending on the IQ
06:36 of the person you're talking to but
06:39 what's interesting is you know there's
06:43 this moment I was talking to a friend of
06:44 mine and I I don't know if I actually
06:45 mentioned this in the last episode
06:48 there's a really really interesting
06:51 profound thing that happens when you
06:57 experience something and then I mean
07:02 like you're there
07:02 you are first
07:04 and I witness and then later on you
07:08 share that experience with someone and
07:10 let's say the event that you were at is
07:12 very profound and let's say that there
07:17 wasn't like a 911 which is super duper
07:19 complex right again I've had three
07:22 people tell me they saw the planes into
07:24 the building's and then when I the
07:25 second plane enter the building and then
07:27 when I said okay where were you standing
07:28 where were you looking all three of them
07:30 had to admit they were looking at a
07:32 television or they were looking down
07:34 they heard the explosion and looked up
07:36 and you know later they found out it was
07:40 a point you know it's like it's
07:42 interesting but a more simple event and
07:46 for me it's really the one where I'm
07:49 debriefed by these folks from NASA
07:53 really one guy you know I used the
07:55 formal word debrief it wasn't like hey
07:57 sit down man get your printer paper out
07:59 or whatever here's the slide show
08:01 nothing like that with two dudes one of
08:04 them very decorated super brilliant dude
08:06 and I don't know the background the
08:08 other guy but they both talked a great
08:12 detail to prove to me that they were
08:14 definitely involved with the Mars
08:16 project out of NASA in the Bay Area and
08:19 so I you know that happened to me in
08:22 1991 1991 men there's no HTTP protocol
08:28 there's no internet I mean there's an
08:30 internet but it's all text-based telling
08:31 that kind of crap I don't have any
08:34 access to it and the reason I mentioned
08:38 that is that you could go online and
08:40 look up some things or whatever not
08:42 available man but I will share that
08:45 truth at times and I'll just have people
08:50 right in the face it's sort of
08:52 metaphorically online especially and go
08:55 [ __ ] like what
08:58 [ __ ] anyone told you that I'm like
09:00 wow fascinating because it did happen
09:05 these people were celebrated within my
09:09 company because they came from NASA
09:11 meaning like super brilliant suit these
09:14 guys are super brilliant because they
09:15 came from NASA and I'm like yeah yeah
09:17 great
09:18 they totally sweet guys man as far as I
09:20 understood both of them resigned as a
09:21 result of being on a treadmill that
09:24 wasn't going anywhere and the one guy
09:27 got the other guy the job but at our
09:29 company but what's funny is the dude who
09:33 told me or ironic or interesting is that
09:35 the guy who told me all this details and
09:37 I heard this hole pass from all the
09:38 other upper management people but him
09:41 being a prodigy kid working in s at
09:42 least 16 and he held seven patents in
09:45 which he bragged to me about
09:49 he's expunged his entire past it's
09:53 interesting he sponged a lot more than
09:56 just NASA but it's just interesting he's
09:58 independently wealthy and I guess he
10:00 just doesn't care he just doesn't like
10:02 being online with information about
10:04 himself he doesn't need anybody else it
10:06 was an interesting thing and so you know
10:13 the other ones you know just having to
10:15 do with I guess the second tier of that
10:20 you know there's two experiences I
10:22 mentioned very briefly which I want to
10:26 mention again which is that at two
10:30 different occasions I had very close
10:34 friends of mine like best friends of
10:36 mine who knew I was into this kind of
10:39 thing and again I'm not into it because
10:40 I think it's great I'm into it because
10:42 I'm like really socks man right because
10:46 I didn't believe that it was fate in
10:48 1991 even after being told what I really
10:50 couldn't comprehend I mean it was like I
10:53 should have been able to totally digest
10:54 it the science was easy to understand
10:57 but the part I had an issue with was the
11:01 claim that a big organization like NASA
11:04 could lie and could pull it off right
11:06 and really up to 1991 you know the moon
11:11 hoax moon mission being a hoax was sort
11:13 of just like I don't know it was like
11:15 10% of me thinking about JFK being
11:18 assassinated by anyone other than we are
11:19 Lee Harvey Oswald just wasn't a big
11:21 priority to me on my in my life but
11:23 anyway I've had two NASA people dropped
11:26 in front of me and
11:31 they there was one was so subtle that I
11:36 barely remember our conversation but I
11:38 do remember getting that person to agree
11:40 with me but the one that was the most
11:43 loud the one that said he sits down in
11:49 front of me and I don't know how it came
11:50 out but the dude who paired us up my
11:53 good buddy it was at a restaurant he
11:55 says you know you guys need to talk
11:56 about this because he knows everything
11:57 about the moon hoax and the dude all of
12:00 a sudden looks away there's nobody over
12:02 there and he just goes well anyone who
12:05 doesn't believe in the moon missions
12:06 just a [ __ ] [ __ ]
12:08 like literally quote-unquote okay I'm
12:12 looking at the guy and I just gave him
12:14 you know a few little tidbits of what
12:18 would have been the case going back
12:19 putting a rover on the Mars all those
12:21 are the kind of stuff taking it some of
12:23 our gigantic telescopes and taking
12:26 pictures of the moon's surface
12:27 you know the disk arrays the digital
12:29 disk arrays telescope arrays in the
12:32 desert and you don't even know what they
12:33 could do looking at the moon I gave him
12:36 like three or four little things and
12:37 then he kind of kinda he's wandering
12:40 around like he's not supposed to talk
12:41 about this obviously but he kind of
12:43 looks around realizes he's in a
12:45 restaurant it's owned by the dude who
12:47 set him down so there's no covert you
12:50 know anything anywhere and I'm just a
12:51 Joe in front of him so he finally cracks
12:55 a grin and he goes yeah you're you're
12:58 right you know and this dude was a top
13:03 top clearance at NASA so it would be
13:07 like area 51 clearance but it would be
13:09 the equivalent of like Queen's clearance
13:10 Q clearance within NASA and so he knew
13:14 he knew it was [ __ ] he and it was
13:16 interesting that he knew because it you
13:20 know I don't even know what his position
13:21 was it was like we couldn't know so when
13:24 these events occurred I'm having
13:26 conversations with people who
13:28 immediately who are intelligent people
13:30 and good people who immediately rebuffed
13:33 this stuff I'm just like really history
13:37 but you know and so you know we're going
13:44 to be
13:45 I've I've recently had to go and I've
13:49 keep mentioning this in episodes because
13:51 it continues okay since the last time I
13:53 made the NASA waste episode I've had
13:55 more conversations about the Kubrick
13:57 involvement and what's interesting about
14:01 it is I discovered something very
14:03 interesting one even the most informed
14:08 geniuses about the moon hoax who have
14:11 done more field research than any other
14:13 people on earth we like they're in the
14:15 top ten people on earth still can't
14:19 divorce themselves from Kubrick being
14:21 involved so the avene are gonna go in
14:23 other rounds she's gonna try to actually
14:25 produce some paper proof of some things
14:27 we already know to be the truth but just
14:30 you know I listen to people and they'll
14:32 tell me that you know you're there they
14:36 don't know they never knew Stanley
14:38 Kubrick never knew the guy never met the
14:40 guy never work with him all the
14:42 information they have on the guy is just
14:44 purely incidental crap that was in the
14:45 newspapers and they behave as if his
14:50 daughter knows a lot less than they do
14:52 but who the hell is she she's an idiot
14:54 buhbuh bar she doesn't know anything
14:55 she's just protecting her dad or
14:56 whatever it's like you don't think we
15:00 talked about those psychological factors
15:02 right so for me you know when I talk to
15:07 Vivian she said look I've avoided even
15:09 remotely touching this moon hoax stuff
15:12 because you know I was with my father
15:15 all during these time tables that people
15:17 said he was often some set filming
15:20 mérida pause for the helicopter but she
15:23 said look man if if he was gone for more
15:25 than well me put it to you this way it
15:29 was a couple days you know he always
15:32 configured his film shooting such that
15:34 he was home for dinner and after she was
15:39 old enough to be on set which we know
15:41 she was in the movie 2001 a Space
15:43 Odyssey she was on the ark in our
15:45 department of The Shining
15:46 and she was around and the older she got
15:49 the more time she spent every single day
15:51 with her dad he loved her to death
15:53 she logged in they had just a really
15:55 cool deep partnership you know
15:57 if he had gone to America in June of
16:01 1968 to film the moon hoax which is a
16:05 new piece of information I've been given
16:08 then she would be there the family would
16:10 be there he traveled by boat because he
16:12 didn't like planes and so you don't
16:15 there was one night in her life where
16:18 she woke up and her dad wasn't in the
16:19 house at night and she threw a huge fit
16:22 she's a little kid doesn't understand it
16:24 was back within the hour but he'd gone
16:26 off to have a little meeting in New York
16:28 and this is about seven years old or
16:31 something like that I think but you know
16:35 so there was this there was this
16:37 knowledge that if I woke up on my dad
16:39 wasn't there I was going to have a big
16:41 issue it never happened again okay you
16:45 know there's some there's some I guess
16:48 extreme exceptions but when there were
16:51 as exceptions the only other exception I
16:52 know was that what during the filming of
16:54 Barry Lyndon they were there was a bunch
16:59 of IRA terrorism going on in in Ireland
17:04 and and so at one point there was about
17:08 I think a three week period where the
17:10 two were separated and she's with the
17:12 her mom and her sister and Stanley was
17:15 off filming but we know where he was he
17:17 was on the set of Barry Lyndon filming
17:19 and the moon missions are already over
17:20 okay so for twelve and a half years she
17:26 was at her father's side and if he's off
17:29 at some Air Force Base or some secret
17:32 base filming something helping them do
17:36 it then she's gonna be with him okay but
17:44 when I hear people make assumptions
17:46 about other people's credibility or
17:48 other people's knowledge bases it was
17:50 like your life wasn't your life I know
17:52 your life because it serves me to have
17:55 this belief about you it's it's a
18:00 mindfuck you know and then the shining
18:04 thing I'm down another round with a
18:05 friend of mine about the shining thing
18:06 and I've heard
18:10 from the comments almost verbatim and
18:14 you know queue keeps advancing this this
18:18 assertion that things mean things that
18:23 he wants you to believe that they mean
18:25 and once you're willing to buy someone
18:28 else's narrative about an event the most
18:33 average event in the universe can become
18:35 a conspiracy okay once you accept a
18:40 normal event as a conspiracy then you
18:43 can start introducing the second phrase
18:45 to lock down your kubler-ross effect
18:47 that you're right and everyone else is
18:49 wrong and you call it a coincidence
18:54 coincidence coincidence right so you
19:00 know the shining scene is a you know the
19:03 little boy Danny playing with his cars
19:06 on a carpet of a hexagonal pattern
19:09 stands a little tennis ball rolls over
19:12 to him from the evil room three to six a
19:15 three to seven the three to seven you he
19:19 stands up he's got an Apollo 11 sweater
19:22 on it's custom and he walks to room 237
19:26 and then something bad happens to him
19:28 and then jack goes up to check and he
19:29 finds the old hot babe and then the old
19:32 lady in the room okay
19:36 well the I just recently saw a
19:39 photograph of the launch pads for the
19:41 Saturn 5 and they're not exactly
19:43 remotely [ __ ] whether remotely shaped
19:45 like a hexagon but they're not exactly
19:46 like the carpet at all so we have been
19:50 told that launch pads and they show you
19:51 future launch pads that were very
19:53 hexagonal but they don't show you the
19:55 one - the Saturn 5 launched on precisely
19:58 and so they introduced the idea that
20:01 this is a conspiracy between the carpet
20:03 and the launch pad well that makes it
20:07 seem like a coincidence but it may not
20:11 even be the truth okay the Vivian was
20:14 assigned to find the carpet when she
20:17 brought all the samples back from London
20:18 her father very casually got off the set
20:23 walked in didn't
20:24 want to be reviewing carpet samples okay
20:26 well isn't a big conspiracy right he's
20:29 looking through everything she brought
20:31 back and she was disappointed that
20:32 everything is she picked he didn't like
20:35 okay if he wanted a hexagonal carpet
20:38 people he wouldn't have sent his
20:39 daughter into London to pick a bunch of
20:41 carpet samples that then he rejects and
20:43 it was like as she described it there
20:45 was a bit of like I gotta wait another
20:48 day to figure out what the carpets gonna
20:50 look like or whatever right in there the
20:53 art director said I'll just throw
20:55 something together he goes back to the
20:57 room with Vivian
20:59 this dude quickly creates a real
21:01 hexagonal pattern thing so you know 80
21:05 rushes it out to Kubrick and shows it to
21:07 him he's like yeah it's great good right
21:09 he's done the idea that it's a huge
21:13 [ __ ] conspiracy is only in the mind
21:16 of people that want to make it a
21:17 conspiracy therefore it's called a
21:18 coincidence and if you have a lot of
21:20 coincidences in your brain you think you
21:22 know this is a sign this is sign from
21:24 [ __ ] you know God or whatever rate
21:26 the sweater she's in the room Vivian's
21:30 in the room Italian family member is
21:34 angsting over what to knit because she's
21:36 been told to make a custom sweater
21:38 that's all she's been told so the big
21:40 debate went around the room of what to
21:42 knit and her boyfriend was in the room
21:45 and said you know what they just landed
21:46 on the moon a bunch of times why don't
21:47 you just do something in space oriented
21:50 so she puts this thing here what's the
21:52 collie and Ollie apart so she comes up a
21:54 little pattern and and stitches it
21:56 together but of course if you weren't
21:59 [ __ ] there you can make up a
22:00 conspiracy that this was all intentional
22:02 the Stanley's like make sure it's a
22:04 rocket t-shirt make sure it says Apollo
22:06 on it
22:07 those those events never occurred
22:09 Vivian's in the room but now that
22:13 becomes a another coincidence that
22:15 stacks up on a bunch of [ __ ]
22:17 coincidences before okay
22:20 then there's a room two three seven dari
22:23 it's a romantic number two hundred
22:27 thirty seven thousand miles is supposed
22:29 to be the average distance from the moon
22:32 to the earth well the average distance
22:37 to the moon is 200
22:38 38,000 miles average okay now when I
22:45 went to high school my teacher always
22:48 told us kids that once our car hits
22:51 225,000 miles that we are we've driven
22:58 to the moon
22:59 so 225 went to 328
23:03 so shit's wrong right okay
23:08 so is the key really the distance to the
23:11 moon or is it just close okay well let's
23:15 just say the moon varies let's just say
23:17 the closest that could be is 225 and the
23:20 farthest away it can be this is that's
23:23 probably not correct at all and the
23:24 first away it may be to 32 42 or simple
23:28 [ __ ] right okay so if you pick any
23:32 number between those two numbers someone
23:35 can assert that Stanley Kubrick in
23:37 trying to I think it was two one seven I
23:41 think was in the book so they added 22
23:45 it to Bay 237 you know this this
23:49 bothered Stanley his whole life in in a
23:53 jesting kind of way that you know it was
23:56 like he lost sleep over but he just got
23:58 annoyed by the assertion that he changed
24:00 the number intentionally into 237 as if
24:02 he had this grand scheme he was like
24:04 they told me not to use 2 1 7 which was
24:07 in the book so I'm busy I'm directing I
24:10 said [ __ ] it just make it whatever
24:11 number you know make it 2 3 7 look at
24:13 whatever not even sure if you picked the
24:16 number or not but the assertion that it
24:19 is a very specific number makes it a
24:22 conspiracy and then that conspiracy
24:24 becomes a coincidence as you coincidence
24:26 of the carbon which isn't true
24:28 coincidence of the sweater which isn't
24:30 true coincidence of the [ __ ] number
24:32 on the key isn't true now a friend has
24:37 brought something to my attention that
24:39 the movie Eyes Wide Shut supposedly had
24:43 a contract in place but if Stanley were
24:46 to die before the release of the movie
24:47 that the movie was to release on the
24:49 anniversary the 30th anniversary of
24:53 either the landing or the launch okay
24:57 well let's just look at the facts
24:58 they're so sure about this thing it
25:01 actually released on July 13th 1999
25:05 Paulo 11 launched on the 20th of July
25:10 hmm okay well let's look at the facts
25:14 here okay the Apollo 11 rocket launched
25:17 on July 16th three days after this
25:21 anniversary date okay
25:24 landed on the 20th well now our seven
25:27 days past the release date so again
25:30 false factoid no one bothers to look up
25:34 the fifth that's real easy on the
25:35 Internet
25:35 therefore the launch date or release
25:38 date
25:39 excuse me of Eyes Wide Shut is is not
25:41 it's close to but not on the 30th
25:44 anniversary so it's a false assertion
25:47 that becomes a conspiracy that there
25:49 becomes a coincidence which locks didn't
25:51 Stanley Kubrick okay we have to not do
25:57 this if we're gonna get to the truth
26:00 right
26:02 imagine that you're an astronaut you
26:11 don't go to the moon but you go into
26:13 orbit you look down on the earth it's a
26:17 brown ball then you go up maybe a couple
26:20 times different things Shuttle missions
26:21 whatever you're in the space station for
26:23 a little while especially if you're in
26:24 the space station let's say that thing
26:26 exists maybe in a different form than
26:28 that while we see what we're looking
26:31 down and then you get back down to earth
26:34 and there's a bunch of you who've done
26:38 it dozens and dozens of you've been into
26:40 little orbit 200 miles up now you're
26:43 looking around you're like you're having
26:45 conversations at the lunch table and you
26:48 say you know it's really weird unless
26:52 you do that little trip this place seems
26:54 flat unless you do that trip you would
26:58 think you're not moving in that weird
27:02 yeah it's almost like it's you'd
27:04 understand why they thought it was
27:06 why yeah that weird yeah okay that
27:13 little kernel incubates for 50 years
27:15 let's just say 45 years all right and
27:20 then someone s is like okay you know how
27:23 we're we've been caught lying about
27:25 going to the moon yeah it sucks then
27:27 yeah an idea oh yeah okay cuz we're
27:31 gonna do what if we could we can't beat
27:35 him at the facts we tried to create a
27:37 website which this this is the true fact
27:40 you know NASA has come up with at least
27:43 used to have web pages I don't even know
27:44 if they're up there anymore I've seen
27:46 them I've read them when they tried to
27:47 address converging shadows and just
27:51 everything that's a problem for them
27:52 which is now ten times the amount of
27:54 crap they put on their website and they
27:57 said well you know what are you doing a
27:59 court case when someone's got you dead
28:01 to rights you attack their credibility
28:08 someone's like okay I feel you but okay
28:10 how are we gonna get these these people
28:13 that are awake to lose their credibility
28:15 because we didn't go to the moon and
28:17 they know and they just get better and
28:19 better and better at figuring out the
28:20 facts well here's my idea you remember
28:25 you know how like all the astronauts
28:26 come back and they say would they travel
28:28 the world after they've been in space
28:30 that no matter how high they go up in a
28:33 plane you never see curvature because
28:34 you don't get 80 miles up and that kind
28:36 of stuff yeah but what if we were to
28:38 relaunch the Flat Earth thing what yeah
28:43 you know start a whole disinfo campaign
28:46 about Flat Earth well what do you mean
28:50 yeah well you know you know light
28:52 actually bends around the edge of the
28:54 earth and you can see things that are
28:56 you know on the other side of the curve
28:57 because the atmosphere refraction and
28:59 stuff like that why don't we just
29:01 leverage all that against them the fact
29:05 that because of the way the universe
29:06 actually works and not the phenomenon
29:08 gravity that's in the you know all the
29:10 science books the there is no sense of
29:14 moving whatever whatever thing they come
29:18 up with I think
29:19 okay let's just let's float this one up
29:22 and see if we can get some funding to
29:23 make this app maybe even hand it off to
29:25 another agency they'll take care of it
29:26 yeah sounds great and so they get that
29:30 that comedian artist guy to run around
29:33 incubating the thing they find they test
29:36 it on people on the Internet and of
29:38 course the people are gonna go for it
29:39 mark Sargent will go for it and believe
29:40 it a hundred percent by the guy that
29:43 just killed himself in the [ __ ]
29:44 homemade rocket bought it and died like
29:49 he doesn't he hasn't done the math to
29:52 figure out he didn't need to go up in
29:53 the [ __ ] thing personally you know
29:56 you need to build a rocket that can hit
29:57 80 miles in the sky at 80,000 feet 80
30:02 miles 80 times 5,280 feet okay and I
30:08 guarantee you if this place is round
30:09 you're gonna see it if you can't reach
30:11 that altitude do not launch and don't
30:14 stop developing you're rocking okay I
30:17 read some you know it's funny the
30:20 stupidities all over the place this guy
30:21 just friended me he's a mutual friends
30:24 people I don't know about the [ __ ]
30:25 guys I went to his web page and he
30:27 posted that poor guy who died in the
30:30 rocket and he said oh this guy this guy
30:35 was trying to prove something that
30:38 anyone can see in a hot-air balloon now
30:41 [ __ ] stupid even Neil deGrasse Tyson
30:43 as pop science was that dude is did a
30:47 whole episode on his show or at least
30:51 somebody's show refilled up a you know
30:52 beach ball of the world and he said look
30:54 you're not going to see curvature of the
30:56 earth in a [ __ ] plane it's not high
30:58 enough right but you got these people
31:01 yes you do man very good friends of mine
31:03 you're very brilliant Stoli cute the
31:05 cans like no you're seeing curvature of
31:07 the window if you're seeing anything I
31:10 looked at the cockpit oh you did I don't
31:12 know what's the shape of the cockpit
31:13 windows just making me wrong just put a
31:16 camera straight to the edge of one of
31:18 the windows and take pictures I did that
31:22 on a bunch of my flights and they're all
31:25 flat as a [ __ ] you know there's a
31:27 level man you're not going to see
31:29 curvature up there man there's not
31:32 enough curvature to register the
31:33 rods and codes in your eyes until you
31:35 get up there okay so the sucker punch a
31:40 bunch of people they really are
31:43 promoting divisive descent because they
31:46 understand the human beings are - I
31:50 don't know how to use a friendly word
31:52 here too much of a certain way to remain
31:55 friends while they disagree about
31:57 something you know with the resistance
32:02 to all this information can be so subdue
32:04 Mille I've talked about it a hundred
32:05 times but it's like when you want the
32:09 bad guy to go down it's almost like
32:13 you'll believe anything about the bad
32:14 guy right you know we have like them we
32:18 have politicians that are definitely
32:20 evil [ __ ] okay they are by
32:25 their own admission by their own
32:27 allegiance to globalism trying to
32:30 destroy all forms of freedom trying to
32:32 usher in socialism which is just
32:35 categorically failed in fact I read some
32:38 article today about a socialistic
32:39 community we generated here in the
32:41 United States and it completely imploded
32:44 but you don't need to go that far all
32:46 you have to do is look at sixties
32:48 communes imploding and you know
32:51 socialism doesn't work but the the thing
32:53 I'm trying to get at is it would be a
32:57 shame if for a lot of these super
33:00 corrupt people we would have to invent
33:02 things to get them prosecuted I you know
33:08 I sometimes wonder it's like um I don't
33:11 think God is gonna worry about any the
33:13 [ __ ] we do down here
33:13 I you know I mean there's staring your
33:16 fellow souls in the face is your is your
33:20 hell right you screw someone over you
33:22 meet them in the afterlife and like dude
33:23 I'm really sorry and I'm sure they don't
33:26 care at that point I do them I sell and
33:29 have an who cares but you know it's like
33:34 I think we have a good thing with the
33:36 awakening especially as it pertains to
33:38 NASA and the beauty of it is is that I
33:42 think that through my own show other
33:45 than the fact that I accused who
33:47 in episode 26 and probably one was a 136
33:53 somewhere in there the second one of him
33:57 being involved I don't know exactly what
33:59 to do with that besides take it down and
34:01 crunch all that out but I'll make the
34:02 episode kind of strange but I did put a
34:05 correction in there in the description
34:08 probably not good enough you know we'll
34:11 have to figure out what to do with that
34:12 but I'm big enough to hear you know a
34:16 logical chain of events and walk away
34:22 from something I believed previously
34:26 it's part of the process it's okay but
34:30 let's just say that we all agree that at
34:32 least the awakening movement that we
34:34 started way before QED ever existed no
34:37 he is very helpful even if he's a LARP
34:40 which nobody knows you know what what is
34:44 bothering me about that dude is he seems
34:48 to be capable of submitting what they
34:51 call cue proofs that he's with the Trump
34:55 you know group like he will do certain
34:57 things that seem like it's undeniable
35:00 for me the time he posted his thing and
35:03 it's someone else in the administration
35:03 posts very similar thing even Trump
35:06 himself 17 is all over Trump's world the
35:11 letter Q is all over trumps world so it
35:14 looks like you know they're they're
35:15 intermixed but the problem is who gives
35:17 a [ __ ] if he's in the administration I
35:19 don't give a [ __ ] if he doesn't know
35:20 anybody in the administration what I
35:22 care about is the constant [ __ ] claim
35:25 that something's gonna happen something
35:29 big is gonna happen that an indictment
35:30 is gonna turn out to be something
35:32 because right now all the people that he
35:35 has said besides maybe Epstein okay and
35:38 maybe a few you know random people in
35:40 the world the big criminals are still
35:44 free 100% 100% and you know every day
35:49 they live they get one day closer to the
35:51 grave and that means one more day that
35:53 they live on this planet spreading their
35:56 evil spreading their agenda
35:58 you got them nine ways to Sunday
36:00 they're just too [ __ ] to level
36:03 the playing field when it comes to
36:04 justice and that is is basically I don't
36:09 know a lesser life or a bigger line or
36:13 something like that you know we have to
36:17 form techniques of vetting the
36:21 information and being more skeptical
36:25 until we really have some hardcore stuff
36:27 now we can be very sure about something
36:29 or be you know siding with it much more
36:33 heavily and there's nothing wrong with
36:36 that you can say well like you know
36:39 someone comes if someone comes up to me
36:40 and says you know do you think Barack
36:42 Obama was born in the United States okay
36:45 here's how I process that well there
36:51 seems to be a lot more evidence that he
36:53 was born in Kenya than any other place
36:56 on earth
36:56 from his Harvard University exchange
37:00 student Kenya thing to his aunt saying
37:03 she was there when he was born to him
37:07 being in Kenya and saying his birthplace
37:09 on a recording took the president of
37:13 Kenya saying this is where Barack Obama
37:14 was born yeah it looks like technically
37:18 speaking wherever his mother got
37:21 impregnated may or may not have anything
37:23 to do with that area now the gentleman
37:25 that is is earmarked as his father in
37:28 Kenya most definitely is not his father
37:30 okay go look at his half-brother who is
37:33 extremely different than him his father
37:37 has completely different geometry and
37:40 you can't take everything that doesn't
37:42 look like the mother and give it to the
37:43 father you can't there's a Indonesian
37:46 cult leader that looks just like him
37:48 Frank Marshall Davis looks a lot like
37:51 him but what if it's none of them but if
37:55 we simply don't know it seems that
37:58 anyone knows anything about Obama is
38:00 killed instantaneously so the Rolling
38:04 Stone reporter that was killed by having
38:06 his car accelerator Jam and he hits a
38:10 palm tree in Los Angeles and just told
38:12 Szold car and dies instantaneous
38:14 this DNC whistleblower that was dad a
38:16 bunch of [ __ ] on Obama just was murdered
38:18 and no one seems to give a [ __ ] I mean
38:20 it's just like really ii did something
38:24 like that happens Donald Trump himself
38:26 should come out and say I am putting
38:29 every goddamned FBI agent that's
38:31 available on this case we will find out
38:34 who murdered this guy every surveillance
38:37 camera every single GPS net we will find
38:41 out who the [ __ ] kill this guy nope nope
38:44 just one more guy gets murdered yeah
38:46 it's just the way it works you know it's
38:47 like we're in the wild [ __ ] West and
38:49 the guy walked into pissed off you know
38:51 Wyatt Earp and he's got a bullet in his
38:52 [ __ ] head two days later for two
38:55 seconds later I guess another way to
38:57 look at this is for those of you who
38:59 watch Walking Dead Season 1 & 2 with
39:03 Shane
39:06 Rick's best friend there was this
39:09 duality and this is where we are right
39:10 now the apocalypse is truth and the old
39:18 world that was destroyed by this virus
39:21 and the TV series is the old guard at
39:24 the Palou seas and the Schumer's and you
39:28 know just the old garden in the first
39:31 two seasons I think it was the end of
39:33 the second season this guy who plays the
39:35 punisher now he was I should playing Lee
39:37 Iacocca and Ford versus Ferrari amazing
39:41 actor I love this guy to death I've
39:43 written something that's he should
39:44 probably play the character on he kept
39:47 trying to convince Rick look we have to
39:51 change our ways the world just
39:53 completely changed everything that used
39:54 to make the world work is no longer
39:56 working it won't work and if we continue
39:59 with these old methods we're going to
40:03 we're gonna perish we're gonna die
40:05 because we're not following Darwin's
40:08 most basic theory which is you know
40:10 survival the fittest ray and Rick kept
40:13 trying to take this high ground this is
40:15 this is beautiful writing so I'm not
40:16 criticizing the story at all
40:18 I'm actually accepting the story
40:19 hundred-percent and this was a very
40:21 powerful scene
40:23 Burak rick kept saying no no we have to
40:26 maintain society we have to
40:28 maintain things the way they were Rick
40:32 was wrong
40:34 Rick was wrong and it wasn't completely
40:40 wrong but the idea was that they had to
40:42 learn how to fight fire with fire now I
40:46 just told you that I don't want to have
40:49 a situation where we make up
40:50 conspiracies that don't exist simply to
40:53 you know pile more [ __ ] on the hatred
40:57 pool we might have for an individual for
40:59 organization that sort of thing because
41:02 these things are generally made of human
41:04 beings right that's what a corporation
41:05 is it's a piece of paper pretending to
41:07 be a human that employs real humans now
41:12 there are conspiratorial humans in these
41:14 organizations that are lying to us
41:15 taking our money and they don't give a
41:17 [ __ ] what happens to us they should be
41:21 discovered investigated prosecuted etc
41:25 etc America is being taught right now
41:30 this supposedly there's this swamp
41:33 cleaning going on and that it's gonna
41:35 take a really really long time to get it
41:37 done
41:38 meanwhile a bunch of people who have
41:40 lied under oath people who have violated
41:44 top-secret clearances from Hillary
41:47 Clinton to McCabe to Comey remember
41:54 author names this should be in jail or
41:58 at least tried and sentenced and will
42:01 let a judge figure out what the
42:02 sentences I mean jail is where you hold
42:04 it before they go to prison right before
42:06 the convictions turn into a sentence
42:08 right that's not what's happening what
42:12 is happening is that we're seeing the
42:15 world of seeing least in America the
42:17 reinforcements that there's two justice
42:20 systems while being told you know we're
42:25 gonna get rid of this whole thing it
42:27 would be so simple to try some of these
42:29 people now with mccabe he said they let
42:31 out let him off a lesser charge because
42:34 they're gonna pin him down for a bigger
42:35 charge he is a young man he could spend
42:38 the rest of his life behind bars but
42:39 also it's all been telegraphed
42:42 so he could run and hide somewhere I
42:44 don't know if John Wilkes Booth thought
42:48 it was crappy to live on an island
42:50 outside of England his whole life it
42:53 seemed like he didn't like his own
42:54 countries so maybe he enjoyed it so if
42:57 they go off to what I call billionaire
42:59 Island which is just a metaphor for a
43:01 place where you don't even know where it
43:03 is physically who knows who knows right
43:08 but it's demoralizing to us to see
43:11 injustice continue to go right you know
43:16 since you guys a few times it's one
43:18 thing to have a bunch of conspiracies
43:20 and the only people you talk to your
43:22 closest friends your allman your dad or
43:24 whatever and you guys can all disagree
43:26 about what's going on and you could
43:28 pitch a bunch of unsubstantiated claims
43:32 because it's only them and either they
43:35 don't care they do care if you go get
43:37 Kotter you won't [ __ ] but most the time
43:39 in those conversations
43:41 nobody wants to waste their life chasing
43:42 your conspiracies so you can claim a
43:44 bunch of weird crap and they're like oh
43:45 okay yeah sure you've been to Atlantis
43:48 we all get it but I'll tell you it's a
43:51 real difference to put your stuff out
43:52 there on the Internet in forms of a
43:54 YouTube channel because you're inviting
43:55 the world to watch it to critique it and
43:59 to check it and that's why on occasion
44:03 I'll completely flub a piece of
44:06 information or overlook something very
44:09 important and you guys are generous
44:10 enough to correct me in the comment
44:13 section
44:13 and so then I update my database you
44:17 know and like I've said it before I want
44:20 you to know I utterly cringe when I find
44:23 that I've been quoting something
44:24 incorrectly to you folks and one of the
44:27 ones that I've been saying incorrectly I
44:29 don't know probably a dozen times and I
44:32 think it was because my teacher quoted
44:35 it wrong because I have a really big
44:37 thing for numbers in my mind memorizing
44:40 them just as an effortless thing he had
44:44 said that Casablanca was released in
44:46 1936 and it was actually released in
44:49 1942 during the War which 36 is way too
44:54 soon for the narrative that's in the
44:55 move
44:56 to go and I never really put it together
44:57 actually I did angst over that going
44:59 okay well I guess German occupation was
45:00 going on prior to us being involved and
45:03 I thought you know maybe that's how it
45:05 way at work but it wasn't it was 1942
45:08 well that kills me it's like YouTube
45:10 won't let me correct the video and then
45:13 repost it within the slot that is the
45:15 video that's already been shared so the
45:17 URL changes if I reload it edited which
45:20 means I lose a bunch of statistics or it
45:22 starts to throw off the count of the
45:24 channel part of that reason for them is
45:27 so that you don't you know post a video
45:30 where you're telling everybody to go F
45:33 themselves everyone responds badly and
45:36 then you re upload the video saying how
45:38 much you want everyone to have
45:39 everything to think 1 in life and I love
45:41 you and then all the responses look like
45:43 they're jerks right so it's part of it's
45:45 just this accountability thing that's
45:47 why Twitter won't let you modify a tweet
45:49 they want to lock you in to everything
45:51 that you say so you can't get out of
45:53 your things you can't against AF you and
45:55 a bunch of you don't racist comments
45:58 everybody hates you and then you say I
45:59 love everybody you know as you modify it
46:02 it's funny how Facebook does that you
46:06 could just totally play with people but
46:08 anyway if we don't develop a process to
46:12 keep ourselves really high on the
46:14 integrity level of trying to spread good
46:17 information then you know whatever
46:21 heroes have been built up through the
46:24 course of the awakening can be taken
46:25 down overnight if they just sit and
46:29 harvest a bunch of beliefs that are not
46:31 true you know the other thing I want to
46:35 encourage you as we just kind of meander
46:37 around the NASA subject matter is that I
46:40 want to set the stage for you folks that
46:43 are interested in this content right now
46:47 NASA JPL are brewing another hoax the
46:51 brewing two hoaxes and we need to be
46:55 vigilant I've given you a hundred
46:57 different ways that we could examine
47:01 their performance and determine whether
47:04 or not it is real or another hoax that
47:07 guarantee you I will personally
47:09 activate a fleet of it doesn't even
47:12 matter if I get killed or whatever this
47:15 is gonna happen no matter what a fleet
47:17 of special-effects folks to analyze
47:19 every [ __ ] second of this footage you
47:22 know what's gonna happen anyway when
47:24 SpaceX faked their booster landing on a
47:27 [ __ ] barge in the Pacific Ocean
47:30 these special-effects folks came out and
47:32 just to have a stated that footage they
47:36 were like there's frames missing there's
47:39 composite techniques you can see
47:42 particle systems that they use in
47:44 various packages I mean they cannot hide
47:47 their hoaxes right but the moon mission
47:50 is like what a hundred times more
47:51 intense than anything that this barge
47:53 would have ever had and of course what's
47:56 gonna happen because the scripts already
47:58 the story is already written I'll tell
48:00 you the story is man goes to the moon
48:03 gets out of a shoe walks around no
48:06 [ __ ] problem you'll have a totally
48:08 ridiculous suit on that will not be able
48:11 to contain the amount of oxygen required
48:14 to be on the moon let alone fend off all
48:17 the temperatures they're gonna get back
48:18 in this vehicle
48:19 it's gonna tape back off and it's gonna
48:21 come home sleep safely no astronauts
48:24 will die and the process of going over
48:26 there same exact thing is gonna happen
48:28 with Mars same exact thing it's all
48:32 gonna be NASA never gets anything wrong
48:35 all right these people could be
48:38 introduced to the most infinitely
48:42 complex problem close their eyes tie
48:46 their hands behind their back and if it
48:49 required of throwing a dart and making
48:51 sure it bounced off 20,000 surfaces and
48:53 landed in a bull's eye otherwise
48:55 everybody dies you know they could have
48:59 it in their teeth they just blow it out
49:00 of their mouths and it will [ __ ] and do
49:02 everything perfect I mean the the
49:03 assertion of this company would they get
49:07 everything perfect and of course they
49:08 throw in Apollo 13 to make you think
49:10 it's it's not gonna be I think problems
49:13 could happen okay and then we had two
49:15 real Space Shuttle catastrophes because
49:18 that's what happens when you really do
49:19 it whenever they decide to have
49:23 this whole thing we have to just be
49:26 ready and we have to have a checklist
49:28 before they conduct their exercise and
49:32 again my videos I think are a great
49:33 example of exactly how to parse every
49:37 step of the way because they can't be
49:38 this lame crap where you know we we have
49:43 a blackout period in the launch we don't
49:46 get any recording of it traveling to the
49:47 moon you know we just get what they want
49:51 us to see what they have CG together was
49:54 all we ever get to see now we know that
49:57 the population that that wants to
50:00 believe is going to ingest this stuff
50:03 like crazy but imagine this imagine we
50:06 get our checklist together way ahead of
50:08 time and we tell our friends hey you
50:13 know what this is never gonna happen and
50:17 that's never gonna happen and these are
50:19 things that should happen just the whole
50:22 idea that again
50:23 you know I this is eating me up more and
50:26 more as just a great smoking gun thing
50:30 and we don't say it enough and I want
50:31 you guys to start saying this which is
50:35 they don't put Rovers on the moon and by
50:39 the way I call the spacex roadster a
50:41 rover a hundred times in that NASA waste
50:43 video and I apologize it confused half
50:45 of you very rightfully so but a rover
50:49 like the one they have on Mars should be
50:52 on the moon first test the platform but
50:56 they can't touch the moon they can't
50:59 touch it because they lied
51:00 six times about what happened on the
51:03 surface of the Moon and so may never go
51:06 back in any way shape or form because if
51:09 they go to the Sea of Tranquility no
51:11 according to this cue [ __ ] oh we went
51:13 one of the secret you know clandestine
51:16 space you know whatever dude whatever
51:19 watch you [ __ ] arrest want people one
51:21 person on earth before a line above the
51:23 [ __ ] went to the moon right really but
51:25 they could Lyanna Rover see a
51:27 tranquility is a gigantic flat area on
51:30 the moon it's that bait those big dark
51:31 spots you know is the smooth you know
51:35 Utah salt
51:37 what kind of land okay so put her over
51:40 there figure out a path
51:42 give yourself some you know wiggle room
51:45 land get that thing out and drive
51:48 straight to all six locations where they
51:52 said they landed on the moon and let's
51:54 just see you recreate all the footage
51:56 let's see you recreate all the craters
51:58 right again explain to me how the
52:01 surface is the same between four
52:03 missions two missions reuse two
52:06 different sets okay so once you make
52:10 that happen now again the only thing
52:14 that could possibly do that won't you
52:15 keep so they have a problem so if we
52:18 were to and I've said this once before
52:19 but if you if let's say they master how
52:22 to get there the challenge is getting
52:26 there it's gonna have to be something
52:29 that's off if you want to go up ahead of
52:31 time so if there are about to give you
52:33 is that they go there secretly put all
52:36 the stuff there that's supposed to be
52:37 there create all the rover lines you
52:40 know from the tyre marks and all that
52:42 good stuff put trash on the ground
52:43 whatever they have to do they recreate
52:45 the the photographs from the you know
52:49 the footage that they supposedly took
52:50 put the cameras there put the American
52:53 flags there all this stuff be funny of
52:55 the American flags because they're not
52:57 going to behave like they did in the
52:58 sets right but get it all prepped and so
53:02 when they go there Oh looky it's right
53:04 there very difficult to do very
53:08 difficult to do and the number one
53:10 reason is is that as they fake the set
53:12 itself faked where all the craters were
53:15 I mean they'd be created craters on
53:17 earth somehow it usually it's just
53:19 explosives in the ground okay well then
53:23 you have to recreate every single minut
53:26 crater on the ground which they could do
53:28 in a small mini sense yes you could say
53:33 micro sense but it's all the mountain
53:36 escapes in the background they can't
53:37 probably recreate unless they literally
53:41 recreate I mean down to the down to the
53:44 pixel from a particular view all the
53:47 photographs that they have up there
53:50 hmm so that's something you can put in
53:54 your bag of tricks you know when it
53:55 comes up you can just say look I don't
53:58 need to show you any footage for you to
54:00 know that it's logical for us to test
54:01 the platform at the inn the easiest way
54:04 it out you know let's look at the fact
54:06 that what is it
54:08 Greenland Iceland and a few other places
54:12 in the world have NASA Rovers and
54:16 they're up there I mean they say NASA on
54:18 them you see pictures of them all these
54:20 cameras set up but we tested it here on
54:23 earth first because why well we want to
54:26 find out if these these Rovers work all
54:29 right well how much money we spent in
54:31 here you mean to tell me Americans are
54:34 gonna be disappointed to see a rover
54:36 land on the moon they're gonna think
54:38 it's a waste of money especially if they
54:40 were to able to drive over to where all
54:41 these American flags have been put in
54:43 the ground all these kickstands from the
54:45 lunar modules I don't think anyone would
54:47 be the slightest bit upset that would
54:49 show that we're really going back to the
54:51 moon and this is the first step but they
54:54 don't Mars be kidding me something else
55:00 I'm gonna go on a little bit of a
55:01 tangent but bring us back to this
55:03 subject matter because there's this
55:07 there's this word we use utopia right
55:10 and it means different things to
55:12 different people at different times
55:13 different locations in the world would
55:16 definitely define it because it's a
55:18 proprietary word based on what we desire
55:21 the most right imagine the world after a
55:25 big reset a true reset well you know
55:29 maybe not even the entire world maybe
55:30 just the United States of America and
55:32 potentially citizens from other modern
55:35 countries might fall in line right they
55:40 might say hey we need to do that here in
55:41 Europe and whatever but whatever let's
55:44 just say United States gets its [ __ ]
55:47 together and gets rid of all these
55:49 organizations and it gets to the point
55:50 where it's sort of like gum there's a
55:54 great scene in the movie forward vs.
55:56 Ferrari which won't spoil the movie for
55:58 you at all but it's Christian Bale's
55:59 playing this driver and his wife history
56:02 but this beautiful
56:03 I don't know her name she's an
56:05 incredible actress the whole movies just
56:07 great I saw it twice second time the
56:09 other day but there's a scene where
56:14 there's some pressure between Christian
56:17 Bale and his wife the character of
56:18 Christian Bale and his wife and it's
56:21 that he's having a hard time making
56:23 money he races but it never really
56:25 yields any prize money and so they've
56:26 kind of always on always on the skids
56:29 and this IRS guy shows up to the wife
56:32 while he's off trying to race and she's
56:35 pissed off that he lied to her that they
56:37 were so upside down in the cash and so
56:40 just before he gets a job where he makes
56:42 like 200 bucks a day in the 60s which is
56:45 just phenomenal not of money he goes off
56:49 with Matt Damon's character to look at
56:51 this new car this GT 4 GT that they've
56:53 designed to start to beat Ferrari it's
56:56 the first time the cars just arrived the
56:58 first time he's gonna take it for a
57:00 drive and he runs off the night before
57:01 he drives the car and he comes back and
57:02 his wife looks out the window and sees
57:04 him go off with Matt Damon's character
57:07 who's Shelby and the next day she's
57:13 driving him just the two of them in the
57:15 station wagon and she starts saying well
57:18 where were you last night would you go
57:20 and do and he's kind of covering up
57:21 because he's not sure if he wants to
57:23 race for Ford and he doesn't want to
57:25 share it with her until he makes the
57:28 decision because he doesn't wanna get
57:29 her hopes up and you know go through
57:30 their dragger through more hell okay so
57:35 she is asking him and he's not
57:39 necessarily lying but he won't tell the
57:40 truth so she starts driving the station
57:43 wagon faster and faster and faster he's
57:44 like he's a racer and they're really
57:47 cool with each other so he was like hey
57:48 run really fast and she goes young going
57:50 fast what do you care
57:52 and she keeps going quicker quicker
57:54 until eventually she spends the car out
57:56 almost goes head-on with another car and
57:58 when they spin out the highlight of the
58:00 scene the conclusion of the scene which
58:03 is brilliant is that he finally comes
58:07 clean he like hey okay well he wants me
58:09 in a race but I haven't made the
58:10 decision yet so I don't want to bother
58:11 you with this drama
58:12 unless I make the decision and she goes
58:15 well does the job pay
58:16 and use yeah it's 200 bucks a day she
58:18 was you didn't say yes it was like well
58:20 yeah I'm not sure and he goes well why
58:23 are you so mad at me she says because I
58:28 just want you to stop lying to me it's
58:32 not pretending like you need to lie to
58:33 me when you don't you could have told me
58:36 we were upside down with the IRS right
58:39 when it occurred and everything would
58:41 have been fine
58:41 you could have come home the night last
58:43 night and told me that there was this
58:45 offer on the table and everything would
58:46 have been fine now regardless of what
58:47 you choose and I find it with Liars
58:52 that's a very big thing now he wasn't
58:54 necessarily lying at the time he held
58:56 back the IRS information which
58:58 definitely put him in the doghouse but
59:02 there's a point when you experience so
59:04 much conspiracy and so many lies with
59:07 excuses that at least you know we don't
59:10 have to agree on why they lie about
59:12 going to the moon we sell the
59:14 inspiration that it gave mankind we saw
59:16 like myself being super interested in
59:18 the space programs because I did think
59:21 we went to the moon and they followed up
59:22 with the real Space Shuttle that really
59:24 launched so hey man it I have things in
59:28 me that I consider assets of my
59:31 intelligence that were given to me by a
59:33 hoax so there's this weird irony of the
59:35 whole thing of me disliking the fact
59:37 that they continue to hang on to it but
59:40 I think there would be a point in the
59:41 release of truthful information that
59:43 we're all gonna get to that point where
59:45 it's like okay you know just tell me the
59:48 truth I'm not going to attack you I'm
59:52 not gonna do anything crazy in fact it's
59:56 like finding a bug in software it's not
59:58 a bad thing it's a good thing because we
59:59 fixed the bug and then it doesn't
60:00 disrupt millions of customers so just
60:03 tell me the truth so the we can go out
60:05 and joyfully reconstruct the world with
60:08 reality with what really can be done and
60:11 when mankind finds out there's an
60:14 obstacle to get to the moon we address
60:17 it and we get past it as a whole society
60:20 instead of a bunch of scientists
60:22 coveting what can't be done keeping
60:25 those barriers from mankind right the
60:30 one thing I think is interesting and
60:32 this is going to be sorry it's a little
60:33 political I've noticed something where
60:40 you know politicians typically do this
60:42 this bait-and-switch thing like like
60:47 what is it
60:48 bush senior telling us read my lips no
60:51 new taxes that's what he got elected on
60:53 and then of course you raise taxes you
60:54 know so these [ __ ] like constantly
60:57 write about what they are but I think
60:59 that the one that I like it Republicans
61:02 have done that type of lie where it's
61:04 like I'm telling you what I'm not gonna
61:05 do it I'm gonna do it the Democrat side
61:08 especially with this campaign that's
61:10 running in 2020 the amount of people who
61:13 have philosophically hated their voting
61:16 base you know they're misogynistic the
61:20 racist they don't believe in you know
61:23 pro-choice bla bla bla Lagaan they're
61:25 only gays getting married all this other
61:27 kind of stuff they've all said it
61:29 they've all been recorded saying it and
61:31 then they wants you to think that
61:33 they've had this big philosophical
61:34 birthing a rebirth to to have you vote
61:41 for them and you're not gonna be against
61:43 them sort of thing right the whole
61:45 Democratic Party you know was racist
61:46 up until this phantom data in the 70s
61:48 where they said oh we made this big
61:51 change okay that should be in Wikipedia
61:54 right shouldn't have a date and
61:55 something we celebrate for Democrats or
61:57 it's like yeah May 4th everybody changed
62:01 or April 1st probably a better date it
62:04 never happened it never occurred the
62:06 party got to a point where they realized
62:08 they had played their cards in the KKK
62:11 and they keep everyone segregated they
62:15 wanted the different water fountains and
62:17 they fought for the south and we keep
62:19 slavery all these things he fought deist
62:21 they fought the 13th amendments creation
62:25 and then they're the ones who create all
62:26 the Black Codes and the Jim Crow laws to
62:28 keep everybody persecuted you know even
62:31 if you were a free slave they do you had
62:32 no education so they baited the trap
62:34 surrounds these people really
62:37 technically remain slaves and so
62:42 that's an archetype that's out there and
62:46 as you know if we were to get our
62:50 fantasy situation where the world
62:52 rebirths at least in our region and I
62:56 you know I don't see this in any
62:58 arrogant way but it does seem that okay
63:00 for as horrible as America is supposed
63:02 to be from all these Democrats right
63:04 every person wants to live here that's
63:07 not in another first world country right
63:10 so Chinese people trying to push in like
63:12 crazy nice to be able to push in like
63:14 crazy Indian people trying to push it
63:15 like crazy all the Middle Eastern people
63:17 are trying to push in like crazy Canada
63:19 man they dig their place they're cool
63:21 Europe they dig their place England digs
63:23 in place but anyone who's in the
63:27 straights even a bunch of African people
63:29 are coming over and they're trying to
63:31 get the American gene we don't want it
63:32 to be missing when they get here right
63:34 and so I think that if we were able to
63:37 in America to you know got this FBI get
63:42 the see a gut vasa gut GPL got some of
63:46 these corporations that are trying to
63:47 control the press and you know advance
63:50 narratives to change the belief system
63:53 of Americans to vote a particular way
63:56 magic starts to occur imagine for
64:00 instance NASA goes NASA goes you know
64:05 just a mind-blowing thing or you know
64:07 nasty executives actually come out in a
64:09 press conference and say now that the
64:12 last astronaut has died
64:14 there's the truth we didn't go the
64:16 bubble blah everyone who works here had
64:18 nothing to do with it because we're all
64:19 brand-new employees and we're gonna do
64:21 there's a new website that we create a
64:23 new kind of wiki out there which is all
64:26 the fabrications what we've been able to
64:28 do all the true facts of all of our
64:29 satellite reconnaissance is all
64:32 published now the Orion mission that was
64:34 coveting of held in secret is then I'll
64:36 publish everything's out there then JPL
64:39 goes next there may be a bunch of
64:42 military spinning for black ops goes
64:44 third big ones big ones go and okay so
64:48 the public is now in this round with
64:51 like okay this is the time
64:54 if you want any understanding and
64:57 sympathy from the population you need to
65:00 go now for motor company GM GE all the
65:06 big networks Disney you know every one
65:09 of them now's the time to come clean
65:12 because if you wait another five years
65:14 ten years to come clean our patience
65:17 with you is gonna be over just like that
65:19 scene Ford versus Ferrari you know she
65:23 told her husband looked he'd be honest
65:24 with me
65:25 and the rest of the movie he was very
65:27 you know he disclosed everything as
65:29 quickly as he realized that she might
65:31 want to know and that fixed their
65:33 marriage she was cool so you know we
65:37 kind of need to fix our marriage with
65:38 our big organizations that are out there
65:43 you know we know that Adam Schiff as law
65:46 is sorry leaking everything that he
65:50 learns from secret meetings it's a it
65:53 should be an utter felony for him to
65:55 leak anything and Trump keeps accusing
65:58 him and Twitter of leaking and saying he
65:59 knows he's leaking okay well do you have
66:02 an FBI do you have any [ __ ] people
66:05 that can just watch where this
66:06 [ __ ] goes can you put a warrant
66:09 out on his phone calls and text messages
66:12 and everything because he's a huge
66:15 suspect in this crime which is leaking
66:19 internal information before it's been
66:21 fully figured out right plus he leaks
66:24 lies to to create disruption because he
66:28 serves as globalist overlords all right
66:32 well we need to see someone's people go
66:33 to jail well in fact we need to see
66:35 every single person who's guilty get a
66:38 sentence of some sort maybe one person
66:40 qualifies for probation maybe one
66:42 person's sentence is nothing more than
66:44 your kicked out a government service and
66:46 you have a Scarlet Letter on you no
66:48 because you rely you know in jail but
66:51 you'll never be revered the way that you
66:54 were when you rely okay you know I'll
66:59 close with this how many times when you
67:02 were a kid you did something that to you
67:07 you were
67:07 to die your parents were going to kill
67:12 you because you broke the window you
67:14 dented the car you whatever you burn
67:18 something you broke something or
67:20 whatever this has been the premise of so
67:22 many sitcoms it's not even funny
67:24 Fresh Prince of bel-air is I probably
67:25 five of these episodes one was simple as
67:28 breaking a lamp I think even the Brady
67:31 Bunch did that once right and if you
67:36 ever become a parent of a child and you
67:38 go through the full cycle of their youth
67:40 you know as a parent that you know your
67:45 kids not supposed to get drunk at a
67:46 party especially under the age of 21
67:49 especially when they're not around you
67:52 they could go off and get killed in some
67:54 DUI accident or all kinds of skip raped
67:57 whatever but you know that you want you
68:02 want to tell your kid look I mean here's
68:04 the the the sort of chicken egg issue
68:08 that we have with our children which is
68:09 the chicken and egg issue we have with
68:11 all these agencies which is you want to
68:14 tell your kid look you're not to drink
68:17 alcohol until you're 21 and you try to
68:20 tell them all the problems that they
68:22 could run into but some parents don't
68:23 even do that but what they don't tell
68:26 their kids half the time is well if you
68:28 do get drunk meaning if you if you go
68:32 against my will
68:33 you're to give me a call no matter what
68:36 here's your cell phone call me you're
68:38 not to drive home drunk you know to be
68:40 with other people drunk because of all
68:42 these things that could happen to you
68:43 and the reason why they don't offer that
68:45 typically is because that kind of says
68:49 it's okay to cheat on my rule hmm I
68:55 think there's probably quite a few
68:57 parents that are missing kids because
68:59 they forgot to give that second half of
69:00 the equation they did just rakonin lee
69:03 come down on their children so you do
69:05 that I'm gonna kill you Bubba kick your
69:06 ass the kid who hit me when I was 18 he
69:09 was 18 to all he could say after he hit
69:12 my car with his car was my dad's gonna
69:15 kill me he's gonna kill me kill me kill
69:17 me kill me he's all he kept saying
69:18 because six months earlier he had hit
69:20 someone else from behind and totaled
69:21 his car in the other car he was test
69:23 driving the car hit me with right so if
69:28 NASA thinks and if the government thinks
69:31 and if corporations think that all we're
69:35 gonna do is burn them to the ground
69:37 enslave all of them in a work camps or
69:39 put them to death or something crazy
69:41 right then they're never gonna come out
69:44 and say look I inherited this situation
69:47 I didn't creat right we're pretty sure
69:51 I'll give you a few examples we're
69:52 pretty sure that Bill Clinton inherited
69:53 the Mena Arkansas runways which is the
69:56 the runways that way up in Appalachian
69:58 Mountains that don't have any roads to
70:00 them to bring in the c-130s full of
70:03 heart heroin and cocaine he inherits it
70:05 as he becomes governor they have to make
70:07 sure he's a slimeball so he'll go along
70:09 with it and then there's accolades if
70:11 you do and there you go
70:13 Holden who was what is it he was the
70:17 Attorney General for Obama he inherited
70:20 the fast and furious guns for drugs
70:23 scandal where we're giving away m16s the
70:26 intelligence agencies we're giving away
70:28 m16s getting cocaine for $1 $2 value
70:31 which same m16 cost you five grand fully
70:34 loaded well we get five grams of coke
70:37 get 5 grand of cocaine at cost roughly
70:40 and then we move it for forty to
70:42 $100,000 and they make the liquid cash
70:44 in the background that funds all these
70:45 clandestine secret projects okay so you
70:49 inherited it's not your thing well I'm
70:52 pretty sure every single human being
70:53 that works for NASA and GPO and all
70:56 these other agencies and other
70:58 corporations where someone like the guy
71:00 that became CEO of Google the NDA guy
71:03 well he didn't make the place it he
71:06 creates project he wasn't part of DARPA
71:08 most likely Facebook whatever if
71:11 Zuckerberg were to leave and some guys
71:13 takes his place well he inherits the
71:15 whole thing and they can come out and
71:17 say look okay for obvious reasons I
71:21 didn't come out my first day and say
71:22 that this place is completely corrupt
71:24 because I don't know I was gonna kill me
71:25 but now since there's this climate and
71:28 there's this movement to be honest to do
71:32 one time clean up
71:34 okay to bring in federal auditors
71:36 whatever it takes right the people get
71:39 to walk through the place and see what's
71:41 going on now we're gonna come out I
71:45 think the only way that that could
71:47 surface would be for us to create kind
71:50 of a buzz it's a super idealistic thing
71:53 that most likely won't happen but I
71:55 think it's just something in the back of
71:57 our mind that again through chatter
71:59 through speaking miracles can happen you
72:03 know I'll give you an example that's a
72:05 little ludicrous but I bet there's a few
72:08 of you that have had this experience you
72:11 and your friends are clever you create a
72:17 few words a few catchphrases a few
72:20 gestures that are cool words to say
72:24 somebody invented the word stoked in
72:27 California in the United States of
72:29 America I'm so stoked that you're coming
72:31 over
72:31 meaning I'm really happy that you're
72:33 coming over whoever created that word
72:35 started using it in the public and
72:38 eventually the whole world starts to
72:40 learn it in 1987 when I first came to
72:43 California my buddy was teaching me all
72:45 the words that they say no one was
72:47 saying it in the Midwest at all at night
72:49 today seven I don't unless they were
72:51 doing it from California right but now I
72:53 can come back to Kansas is it go into a
72:55 little tiny country town with 10,000
72:57 people and I can hear someone go yeah
72:58 totally stoked you're here you know like
73:00 whoa that word got all the way into the
73:03 lexicon of the Midwest all right
73:07 so we start talking a little bit of
73:09 tolerance to expunge all these lies
73:14 without major penalty as a matter of
73:17 fact you know how many times you get a
73:19 plea deal because you're willing to turn
73:21 in the truth all the time plea deals you
73:24 know end up in someone else getting
73:25 prosecuted but if the head honcho comes
73:28 out and says look I'm gonna fully
73:31 disclose but I want to make sure that
73:33 neither myself or any of the employees
73:36 that inherited these clandestine secret
73:38 projects that's really tuned the same
73:41 words but just in case you don't know
73:42 what that word means
73:43 I wanted to go to jail they're gonna be
73:47 fully cooperating with everyone in fact
73:49 we've done a massive due diligence to
73:51 prepare press release we've made 10-hour
73:55 movies
73:55 declare a ball issues we're gonna
73:58 rewrite the history books and we're
74:01 going to also okay this is the cool part
74:04 about it
74:05 if NASA were to come clean and there's
74:08 60 million dollars a day doing you know
74:11 probably some great stuff and then some
74:13 fake [ __ ] okay so say you come clean on
74:16 your blue screen ISS crap the harnesses
74:18 or the composite work that's going on
74:20 now maybe SpaceX doesn't survive some of
74:25 their [ __ ] but you know I think
74:27 they're really doing some real launches
74:29 and some real supply missions some other
74:31 things that are legit but you know some
74:35 of them might take hits but maybe we
74:37 make it a hundred million dollars a day
74:39 because what we're really gonna do after
74:42 that is we reassess everything well we
74:44 say okay folks did we want to build the
74:47 ability to go interplanetary we're gonna
74:52 use the moon as a little platform once
74:54 we completely master getting to that
74:56 location back and forth we do put a flag
74:59 in the ground we do build a base up
75:02 there if it's even possible if it's not
75:04 possible then we'll wreath row
75:06 everything we'll figure out well maybe
75:07 we can't exist on other planets who
75:09 knows right and then we move it to Mars
75:11 and weari you know where you launch
75:14 everything get rid of the lies get paid
75:17 to go the truth route full disclosure
75:20 websites that report everything that's
75:23 going on
75:23 not the schematics of all how everything
75:26 works folks but just we built a new
75:29 motor and boy is it really powerful we
75:31 think it's gonna get us what we need you
75:34 know you remember those old contests
75:36 that used to have or you have a
75:37 thermometer on a piece of paper and then
75:40 you'd be fundraising and someone would
75:41 come and fill it up with red you know
75:43 marker well what if we built a design
75:47 just like a video game like civilization
75:50 when you have to go to Alpha Centauri
75:51 with this big rocket and you create all
75:53 these different habitat modules and
75:55 launch modules and also there's
75:57 but if NASA would come up with a
75:59 platform that they think will get us to
76:01 the moon it's a space station we're
76:03 gonna have ferry fuel up there maybe
76:05 it's not fuel maybe something else maybe
76:07 jet engines or rocket engines don't work
76:09 in space because there's nothing to push
76:10 off of ok let's come up with something
76:14 else and then as we invent these things
76:16 we address these like symbols of design
76:19 we fill it in well we could have it out
76:22 worked out we just don't have the you
76:24 know the launch vehicle worked out
76:25 whatever and it becomes this exciting
76:28 living gain that they tower world plays
76:33 maybe it's not the American flag maybe
76:35 it's like the world flag you know
76:37 whatever if everybody participates
76:40 anyway I think you feel me once I
76:42 realize that Eric episode but it's sort
76:44 of Vince some of the mortar between the
76:48 bricks that I think about between
76:50 episodes that I'm like Jesus I don't
76:51 have fit that in an episode so I thought
76:53 you guys might dig that anyhow if you
76:56 haven't been to deep thoughts radio calm
76:58 please go today I'll make a short bumper
76:59 it's got video links audio links it has
77:03 social media links as donation links it
77:06 has a store and it has the all new
77:10 remastered sees one so get up there
77:13 bookmark it get around make sure you've
77:15 seen all the episodes you dig because
77:17 there's a lot of stuff out there
77:19 I guess there's five hundred ten active
77:20 videos up there and you can download all
77:23 the mp3s to your device and listen at
77:26 your leisure
77:27 so take care of yourself and someone
77:29 else I'll see you in the next deep
77:31 thoughts over now
77:35 [Applause]
77:38 [Music]
77:41 [Applause]
77:45 you
