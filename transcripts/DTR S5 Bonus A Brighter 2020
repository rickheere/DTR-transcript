00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentlemen let's see today is I guess
00:37 it's technically just crossed over into
00:39 the Wednesday timeframe just a little
00:43 bit past midnight there's all weird I'm
00:48 taking a shower today I just woke up and
00:51 just started working so the my work
00:56 schedule is so insane right now that I
00:58 do not have time to sit and complete my
01:01 research on Tesla I know what I want to
01:03 do towards the end of the episode that I
01:06 already know but I want to research his
01:08 his sister a little bit more and I'm
01:10 listening to one of his books that he
01:12 wrote about himself it was published I
01:15 believe in 1919 but I don't leave you
01:18 guys hanging so you guys contribute a
01:20 ton to our social media contribute your
01:24 hard-earned dollars and so I did the
01:29 episode up there in Joshua Tree the
01:32 audio was just really rough and now I
01:36 can tell you what happened the audio was
01:39 horribly horribly destroyed by the wind
01:42 and I managed to get audition to through
01:50 a very very meticulous process to remove
01:52 the wind and not destroy the base and my
01:56 voice visitar sound like you're
01:58 listening it through some like string
02:02 can phone or something for those of you
02:06 looking at this in the normal feed
02:08 you're like what the hell you're talking
02:09 about you're gonna have to join one of
02:11 the one of the movements there go join
02:14 Twitter Facebook mine's calm or patreon
02:19 and you'll be able to see the link to a
02:22 episode called a resting-place I will
02:25 warn you it's a rough one only the
02:28 diehard people will tolerate the sort of
02:32 fading of my volume going in and out I
02:35 tempted to boost it
02:37 again because of my schedule is how to
02:39 get that thing powdered out there I
02:41 can't afford to do like six hours of
02:43 editing just a lot of things percolating
02:47 here so yeah I just completed a phone
02:53 call with him on my 29 year friends he's
02:58 like my big brother
02:59 and it doesn't matter for this
03:06 conversation he's black he has been my
03:11 rock he's in my entire life
03:14 it's late because I work for him he's
03:16 worked for me we've kind of gone back
03:17 and forth we both got a chance to do a
03:20 couple years at Electronic Arts together
03:21 which was just wonderful we started off
03:23 in the database industry together he's
03:26 just a lot of cool dudes on planet earth
03:28 the best big brother anyone could
03:30 possibly have I'm just gonna hop around
03:34 a little bit look into some cool stuff
03:38 I'll turn it into a normal sort of
03:41 theoretical deep thoughts I think
03:44 eventually here but I wanted to mention
03:47 a few things here you know if you know
03:51 that at least for the Digitas people
03:54 that you live with
03:55 right the different races that are part
03:57 of area you have no racial significant
03:59 racial bias against anything and your
04:02 neighbor because you grew up with them
04:03 or you've moved into those neighborhoods
04:05 at least early enough that you didn't
04:07 have a chance to have a bad emotion you
04:09 didn't let yourself get infected by
04:11 somebody else when you hear about racism
04:15 and people complaining about it you do
04:17 get that ping of like oh come on it's
04:21 not that bad right and then you see the
04:24 crazy [ __ ] [ __ ] going on right now
04:27 pardon my french you know my buddy
04:33 there's the white guy that gets murdered
04:35 in a hotel he's trying to hold his hands
04:39 up in this utter crazy killer cop and
04:43 I'm just semi said he was a [ __ ]
04:45 stone-cold killer
04:46 it's got like an m16 or something
04:49 pointed at the guy in the air 15 or so
04:51 the guy is drunk he is crying he is
04:54 trying to put his hands up he doesn't
04:56 know what he's never been in this
04:57 situation before the guy he's yelling at
04:59 him like I don't know I don't even wanna
05:03 compare em to you things it would be
05:04 even more insulting to any other example
05:07 I could give and he tells the guy that
05:10 crawled towards him crawl crawl as they
05:13 hands down thank you don't crawl with
05:15 your knees you crawl with your hands
05:16 when he brings his hands down to crawl
05:18 on the carpet the guy opens fire
05:22 they cut the camera because it must have
05:24 been the most gruesome thing I don't
05:28 even want to share what I would do to
05:31 that cop that particular guy no no this
05:35 is not a generalization at all well my
05:38 buddy mentioned that on the phone is I
05:39 don't even know if that's real it looks
05:41 so insane yeah I don't know either but
05:45 here's what I want to mention because I
05:49 just realized something
05:50 like it's worth sharing my buddy
05:54 I've known for 29 years we have shared I
05:59 think everything that we knew to share
06:02 we have been on projects together all
06:04 kinds my business is business other
06:06 people's businesses are personalized we
06:09 share our families you know this kids
06:13 were a little older mine so there was no
06:14 group connection there but um tonight
06:18 and probably one other phone call my
06:23 buddy is one of the most handsome guys
06:26 you'll ever meet
06:27 he's one of the most dapper guys always
06:29 nicely dressed
06:31 he's just shared with me just some of
06:35 his run-ins with police officers and he
06:39 told me he goes it doesn't matter if
06:40 they're water black because this is just
06:42 cop thing and yeah he's been they've
06:48 attempted to arrest him a couple times
06:49 cuz he had like he was driving a nice
06:52 car broad daylight went to he went to
06:57 Home Depot he said he wearing some like
06:58 just throw on clothes and he says I'm
07:01 pretty sure the cop thought I had
07:02 potentially you know stolen this car
07:04 great there me at my curly and I look
07:06 like I got like you know just paint your
07:10 house clothes on rain and luckily he
07:13 told some people to film him and the cop
07:15 backed up but still impound his car I
07:16 mean it'd be 500 bucks for really
07:19 nothing he said yeah a tiny bit of laps
07:23 on his registration sticker
07:26 it's a fix-it ticket man 15 bucks 35
07:32 tops right and you got to pay for it
07:33 right here's the thing when I heard who
07:41 I consider to be my family my brother I
07:44 mean like my brother brother telling me
07:50 about what he experienced and knowing
07:52 him and knowing that he does not provoke
07:54 any emotions of competitiveness like
07:58 like you know some people look really
08:00 mean hard he just look like a me
08:03 president he's as dapper could be well
08:07 spoke super educated super rich kid
08:10 hearing him recalled moment after moment
08:15 after moment I will never know what it's
08:18 like to be him by any means but now I've
08:22 just had an extra dimension hit you know
08:24 handed to me because this is someone I
08:27 love dearly and I never knew I mean I
08:32 would assume that something would have
08:33 happened to him in his lifetime but I
08:36 think you really just got to play goes
08:39 run out of time to tell you more so
08:41 everything right
08:42 I was definitely not a fan of the NFL
08:46 kneeling as it spread the first time
08:50 through and I think the thing that
08:53 frustrated me and I said in one of the
08:55 episodes I've said in two or three
08:57 episodes was that they were kneeling
09:01 more than they were talking and that now
09:04 I'm even more frustrated if that
09:06 happened because I'm like people are
09:07 dead now
09:08 we could have kicked this thing off four
09:10 years ago or whenever that happened I
09:13 was like that was like 2010 right here
09:15 solitary
09:16 2014 so naira can't remember we just got
09:20 some serious [ __ ] to fix prison systems
09:26 gotta get fixed nothing can be for
09:28 profit ethic trained cops got fixed the
09:32 police unions have got to be adjusted
09:35 where use lethal force is gonna be just
09:37 lethal force has to be decided as a
09:39 country hand it out across all 50 states
09:45 repeating myself for my black lives
09:47 matter episode but I just got the phone
09:50 call just now I was like dude I got a
09:52 record I don't make this one a dark one
09:56 so we're gonna move on I just want to
09:58 share that with you because it's like
10:02 they're trying to mangle our minds with
10:04 the perpetual illogical [ __ ] that's
10:09 going on right I I asked him today
10:12 because the friend of mine said
10:13 something right around this patio like
10:15 three days ago and he said something I
10:17 thought made sense and he goes because
10:20 the Atlantic thing right the Wendy's
10:22 thing seriously men shot the guy in the
10:26 back everyone's saying it was justified
10:29 he did go for a gun it looked like it
10:32 just happened to be a Taser that's a
10:34 move that can get you killed but once
10:36 you once you fail to get it once you
10:40 fail to grab a gun off a guy and you
10:42 start running the other way when all the
10:45 dick I did was fall asleep in line to
10:48 get food out of Wendy's who would have
10:50 ever thought if you just lose
10:52 consciousness in your cartr Wendy's in
10:54 line they're gonna be dead in ten
10:56 minutes yeah he resisted arrest and
11:00 other kind of stuff I know plenty of
11:02 people of all colors that when they get
11:04 drunk they get mad it's a biological
11:07 reaction people your body's under attack
11:12 and you're not rational but let me just
11:17 ask you this the scrawny white guy who
11:21 shoots him in the back 20 feet away
11:24 which if any of us did that we'd be in
11:26 jail for murder for sure
11:27 we'd be facing 10 to 20 years at least
11:31 doesn't matter what color that guy would
11:33 be right what if it was that dudes best
11:37 friend in line at the Wendy's I bet he
11:42 would have got him home he lived two
11:43 blocks away just nuts men okay let me
11:50 change the subject thank you for being
11:52 patient with me at least the audios
11:54 better sprinklers will go off next door
11:56 I believe I was at the ocean with a
11:59 friend of mine I've had a really
12:04 interesting couple two weeks in terms of
12:07 epiphanies and interesting things and
12:11 it's been a kind of frustrating I have
12:13 been able to have the time to really
12:14 record a good linear thought there and
12:18 because I kind of let myself be
12:20 constrained by the idea of the test left
12:22 so lastly I'm just gonna throw these out
12:24 before until we get that thing done so
12:26 you guys will have something so we can
12:29 share but went down to the beach couple
12:35 weeks ago with a friend of mine and you
12:40 know there's that beach sound bright
12:43 daylight Lilly afternoon great day
12:45 literally perfect day well the first
12:48 days that we're allowed to go on a beach
12:49 without our masks I'm yet to wear one
12:53 once but the waves do with the waves do
12:57 right they soothe you
13:00 it's a white noise sound it soothes you
13:04 a lot of places do that when I was up
13:08 there Joshua Tree by the time I
13:10 cancelled out the audio what you weren't
13:13 able to hear was the way the wind blew
13:15 through this pine tree and over these
13:17 rocks was making this sort of hum I've
13:20 never heard when they go home before the
13:24 ocean wave was so profoundly effective
13:30 in this tense weird world we live in
13:34 right where you're told that if you just
13:35 talk to somebody you know masks don't
13:38 protect you against viruses it's like
13:40 put
13:41 a chain-link fence to protect yourself
13:42 against mosquitoes we need you know
13:48 peace and quiet now and our souls don't
13:52 and oddly enough in the middle of this
13:55 crap I have found a lot of peace you
13:57 know so I said to my friend Carla she's
14:03 very existential as well I said what if
14:08 the sound of God's voice sounds like a
14:13 wave and he's talking to us right now
14:19 through that sound which is why it seems
14:22 to infect us soothes us and then a week
14:27 and a half later the winds going through
14:32 those hills up there
14:35 soothing we are a sense machine right we
14:42 have five senses at least bitter primary
14:48 like the five food groups well at Joshua
14:52 Tree I was looking at the stars on
14:54 Friday night Saturday night this is a
14:58 fair amount of light pollution over the
15:00 hills by Palm Springs but for the most
15:03 part it was about a 85% pretty black sky
15:09 and the stars are soothing aren't they
15:13 another since just my eyes seeing stars
15:19 soothed us
15:21 I made friends with gonna usually I
15:27 don't mention my friends names I think
15:33 this one's kind of significant because I
15:36 think her spiritual journey is extremely
15:39 unique she's an amazing person she was
15:41 amazing partner David but it's a woman
15:48 named Robin power and she dated Prince
15:50 for a couple years and was in his world
15:52 for way more than two years
15:54 and we just met and there's just a
16:01 spiritual awakening where she was
16:05 describing the fact that her partner are
16:11 like identical but not like anybody else
16:14 and so there's this you know obviously
16:18 there's a bit of a communication barrier
16:21 when you're not like other people
16:22 because you're more open-minded and
16:24 you're more enlightened and very serious
16:25 so we get to talking and she's just got
16:30 thousands of videos and thousands of
16:32 experiments she's an artist she's done
16:34 music you know she just does all kinds
16:36 of interesting things and he's a huge
16:39 part of it and he's like behind the
16:40 scenes and making it all happen he has
16:42 his own set of talents and and I just
16:45 felt like this amazing kindred
16:47 relationship over a phone over some
16:51 internet content sharing and that kind
16:53 of stuff and she had enough just an
16:57 amazing theory I forgot what this was an
17:06 alien race she had an amazing theory and
17:10 I make sure I get this right well I
17:14 can't I can't find the alien race it
17:16 kind of sounds like the Raelians but
17:17 it's different but it's a race of aliens
17:21 that is attributed to Atlantis or
17:27 lumeria
17:28 you know gets more of Atlantis but her
17:33 honor partner watched the episode on
17:36 alternate realities or parallel yeah
17:40 excuse me and she said you know does she
17:44 you know a new Prince and she's with him
17:46 when he's making that guitar that guitar
17:48 I put in the episode that when his his
17:49 Purple Rain guitar the very end of the
17:51 movie one it's like a like a Roman
17:54 column kind of thing and it just does
17:57 something to me and I realized that the
17:59 evie a pod in 2001 is is the identical
18:03 object it's from that world
18:06 and she said to me that the funny she
18:08 goes well you know what you are right
18:10 and I suppose I want a whole different
18:12 direction she's no no no no no she
18:14 wouldn't you're she names the alien race
18:17 and I hadn't heard that name before and
18:19 she goes you're from that race that made
18:24 Atlantis and you know when someone says
18:27 something really open-minded like that
18:29 you you're not supposed to say yeah
18:33 you know supposed to say oh of course
18:34 you're supposed to be oh you're crazy
18:36 and I'm not crazy great but coming from
18:39 her with her background which I just
18:42 scratched the surface on it's both of
18:45 them but she goes the thing that you're
18:50 seeing at least when you see his guitar
18:52 it's that place you're just calling it
18:55 up I just thought that was awesome you
18:58 know there's been some amazing movements
19:00 in the world where we start to look at
19:01 things a little bit differently and
19:03 what's funny about it
19:05 / interesting is that we know of times
19:09 in history when
19:13 man was in one place on planet Earth and
19:18 then other people arrived and the whole
19:23 world changes sometimes for the worse
19:25 sadly for the worse and a lot of cases
19:28 right but imagine the Egyptians they
19:31 built this phenomenal place I mean you
19:36 know just think about it this way with
19:39 Egypt we are looking at Egypt I'm gonna
19:44 say in my book with Graham Hancock
19:46 research and a bunch of other people's
19:48 research in the last 10 to 15 years
19:50 we're looking at a civilization that was
19:53 probably at their first peak more than
19:59 37 thousand years ago those pyramids
20:04 were built tens of thousands of years
20:07 ago by in my opinion by looking at the
20:11 hieroglyphs going all the way back to
20:13 iconic Arabic or iconic hieroglyphs
20:16 excuse me
20:18 all of these citizens were black painted
20:22 with that skin color brilliant master
20:25 artists and it didn't start lightening
20:27 up until you know much later in the game
20:32 the bust of King Tut oh my god look at
20:34 the guy anyway they were in their own
20:40 world and yes they did do the Valley of
20:42 the Kings and the Nile and that kind of
20:44 stuff but still they you know it's it's
20:46 not that far down when you really start
20:47 looking at the NAM even though the Nile
20:49 is gigantic who knows how far down they
20:51 went when they got chased out of their
20:54 area by getting invaded over and over
20:57 and over again they have nots just
21:00 couldn't handle that Egyptian Egyptians
21:03 had made it work they probably just
21:06 sailed down the Nile and that's where
21:08 you get the the now that broken up
21:10 tribes of the initial people who had pie
21:15 figured out how to our monix figure down
21:18 an electricity figured out obviously had
21:21 some pretty badass construction skills
21:23 that they never documented
21:27 you know these meteorites to make him
21:29 bomb it was just amazing we know all
21:31 these villages and New Guinea and Peru
21:33 and the homeless on jungles down south
21:39 at one point there's first contact and
21:42 it changes everything so the reason why
21:45 I mentioned that again is that seeing
21:52 God through the sound of a wave being
21:56 his voice he being a relative term of
21:59 course it's sort of a paradigm shift
22:03 from my brain has started opening up a
22:05 lot of stuff man what actually is going
22:08 on and where we are and where we can be
22:10 I will say that even though 2020 has
22:14 turned out to be the smelliest pile of
22:19 poo I've ever seen in my life people are
22:23 still extremely optimistic about how
22:26 this world is how this year's skis and
22:28 he's gonna end and I you know I can't
22:32 even shake the fact that I feel exactly
22:33 the same way I hope you feel the same
22:37 way too if you're a biblical Christian
22:42 person I should say I can't speak for
22:45 other religions in any massive detail I
22:47 apologize
22:49 then you know that there was a time that
22:51 it's fabled to have existed where you
22:56 know God was he was hanging out with us
22:59 almost all the time right like it wasn't
23:05 even a surprise God started talking to
23:07 you you certainly stood at attention and
23:10 started behaving but it was like he was
23:13 here all the time every time we find a
23:17 culture that we would call primitive
23:21 their extreme spiritual and what happens
23:25 to him we pound it out of them right
23:31 yeah for those of you know that I have a
23:34 different belief in the history of
23:36 Christianity again I can't stress
23:39 enough that I find the value in the
23:42 lessons I don't want to lose them and if
23:47 it really can I just tell you this like
23:49 this is a ludicrous example but if God
23:53 came down to me and said okay dude you
23:58 got me you got me I got your help this
24:03 is just fictitious so bear with me here
24:05 some people might see this example it's
24:08 fairly blasphemous but let's say God
24:09 says to me okay
24:11 the story of my son and all that stuff
24:14 was definitely a story but did you see
24:17 how it impacted the world for the better
24:21 Catholics unfortunately or what the
24:25 Catholic Church did but you know all
24:26 these other folks that managed to pull
24:28 out and distill the beauty of the
24:30 message I did that because that's a
24:33 mechanism to keep you my children close
24:36 to me I've told it several times over
24:40 several millennium the Egyptians had
24:45 Isis and Horus the Babylonians had
24:49 Ishtar and Nimrod the the Irish had kou
24:56 :
24:57 and on and on and on the Mormons have
25:00 Joseph Smith the messages might be
25:05 retold simply to keep some moral code
25:09 from the universe a truth code how to
25:13 honor everyone's space common-law right
25:20 but he says to me okay I'll make you a
25:22 deal I need you to set you believe in
25:27 Christianity box Taco Bell
25:29 front page of first page of Old
25:32 Testament to the last page of the New
25:34 Testament
25:34 I need you to say you believe and if you
25:38 say you'll believe what I'm gonna do for
25:41 the world is clean it out and juice it
25:46 up but you're gonna have to say that you
25:49 believe something you really don't
25:50 believe deep down inside and I've just
25:52 told you
25:53 and there's some truth in it obviously
25:56 some people really did exist some things
25:59 really did happen but just to me not
26:01 about me I would do it but the greater
26:07 good of mankind when those elders in
26:10 that church I went to Camarillo
26:14 told me that they didn't think Jesus
26:17 really existed but it was better that
26:19 they that we do believe he exists
26:20 because it stabilizes society I was
26:24 shocked I mean I inside that room I got
26:27 a PhD biblical professor from Pepperdine
26:31 I've got a PhD psychologist from
26:34 Pepperdine I have my preacher I've got
26:38 some other guys listening not not
26:40 contesting right you think some guy in
26:43 the room would go hey you know hey this
26:47 is not true it is all real not a single
26:51 one of them stepped on that guy's word
26:54 since he was telling me the Jesus most
26:57 likely didn't exist but it was better
26:58 that we believed that he did exist I
27:01 mean just to this day's blows my mind
27:04 thinking about it but God for me who
27:08 will certainly exist the afterlife most
27:10 certainly exists both from my experience
27:14 as a 23 year old trying to commit
27:17 suicide because I had a bad relationship
27:18 I lived a meeting Walt Disney at
27:21 Disneyland there's some other wild stuff
27:25 that's happened in my lifetime all of
27:27 which you've heard it's comforting the
27:35 parallel universe thing is super
27:36 comforting I mean wow I'm sure there's
27:40 bad places too but I have the sneaking
27:44 suspicion that you get what you asked
27:46 for if you are looking for everything to
27:51 be negative that's what your life will
27:52 be you know when I was a kid again
27:58 growing up in a small town the beautiful
28:00 thing about the small town is you get if
28:03 you have a decent memory
28:05 you get to see individuals go from
28:08 childhood to adulthood and you get to
28:11 see thousands of people do it and you
28:13 remember them all because you only have
28:15 10,000 people in your whole hometown and
28:19 buddy of mine and I've been comparing
28:21 notes and looking on this patio once a
28:24 week at least our high school reunion he
28:27 went to San Diego his class was only
28:30 like um about fifty people more than my
28:33 class so he has the same experience he
28:35 goes back to his high school reunions
28:37 and he just gets to see the ecosystem
28:40 where everybody went and their
28:42 philosophies either working out or not
28:43 working out the most popular kids turned
28:46 out to really have a hard time in life
28:48 and some of them crashed and burned
28:50 miserably the kids who were the misfits
28:53 became the most successful people the
28:56 pretty people mmm the fraction of them
28:59 stay pretty the awkward looking people
29:01 became really pretty it's very
29:04 interesting how that happens right but
29:07 one of the characteristics of this data
29:10 set that I have is that I get to see the
29:16 people that were very how do I put this
29:22 not necessarily negative but I you know
29:24 I have a friend of mine who in my
29:28 opinion uses hypochondria as a way of
29:33 getting attention you say hello to them
29:36 I got two or three friends like this you
29:39 say hello to them and they want to their
29:42 form of conversation with me isn't hey
29:44 how you doing you know how your work
29:48 how's your life whatever it's I had this
29:51 surgery I had this surgery had the
29:53 surgery just like you have to see man I
29:55 have I have varying levels of respect
29:59 for dermatology I had some clients of
30:04 mine 2003 and four same clients married
30:09 couple or couple or whatever it just
30:11 revealed the scam to me of dermatology
30:15 and skin care scam half
30:18 [ __ ] you do to get all this stuff
30:20 removed they keep telling you had some
30:22 bad cells on your face it's a [ __ ]
30:25 scam scam scam scam but I got a friend
30:31 who just talks about all these the
30:32 elements constantly got injured a couple
30:35 years ago can't shut up about it
30:37 can't is Natalia broken I am the day a
30:40 broken a.m. what do you want me to do
30:42 you're less attractive the more that you
30:44 constantly go through this stuff I don't
30:45 listen to you man it's all negative stop
30:49 going to the dermatologist and you're
30:50 gonna have less skin problems trust me
30:53 why would you believe a doctor who's
30:57 like you know it's like you need surgery
31:01 surgeons are the best doctors in the
31:03 world hands down they're the most
31:06 brilliant and most talented they're
31:09 truly trying to solve problems you can't
31:11 just cut people open for no reason it
31:13 happens exploratory back surgery is the
31:17 biggest scam on planet Earth - it's all
31:18 stress but I'm trying to get you know
31:22 these friends of mine to stop focusing
31:25 on the negative and stop trying to turn
31:27 that negativity into positivity because
31:29 it's never gonna happen
31:31 how's that ever gonna work right Prince
31:35 said a song called positivity which he
31:38 wrote right after the Black Album was
31:39 pulled off the shelf because they were
31:42 dark right and he made the song called
31:45 positivity which is rumored to be the
31:46 first song he wrote after the Black
31:48 Album was as per his request pulled off
31:51 the market but in that song he says son
31:56 I love sexy album which is one gigantic
32:00 continuous track back in the day you
32:03 bought the CD and you had to listen to
32:05 all one track fast forward the head if
32:07 you wanted to get to the next song but
32:09 you didn't know where those songs broke
32:10 great it says more lot more hard to love
32:14 than it is to hate I have an episode on
32:17 positivity I think in season one or the
32:19 website deep thoughts radio calm click
32:22 on the season one the different channel
32:26 and I mentioned this but now we're in
32:29 the middle
32:31 2020 and isn't this the truth then we
32:39 have folks that have been brutalized for
32:42 centuries and the hate needs to come out
32:47 you know the hate for the situation
32:52 we're talking today about the there's
32:58 the thing that's going on in Los Angeles
32:59 that you may have no knowledge of
33:02 depending on where you are in the world
33:04 but there's been a lot of tension
33:06 between the Mexicans and the blacks in
33:08 LA now Mexicans have always been coming
33:13 to America but since the DNC figured out
33:15 they're good voting base it's more now
33:20 hard-working people sweet people just a
33:24 great culture in the ones that want to
33:27 come up here they don't bring that
33:28 federales wrap up with them right
33:31 there's always bad apples in all
33:33 cultures so spare me any comments like
33:36 that but the interesting thing I told my
33:41 buddy was I said you know because I'm
33:42 here in Los Angeles area is that the
33:47 black culture since the late 70s when
33:50 all this crack cocaine was dumped and
33:52 the Crips and the Bloods were augmented
33:54 into reality and then rap was good and
33:58 then it was bad you know it's all
33:59 gangster [ __ ] right except for Hobson
34:02 guys [ __ ] you know if you haven't
34:06 done Hobson each Opie yes I in my dude
34:10 is deep thoughts and a rap the black
34:14 culture is tired it's tired man it's
34:19 been abused for a really long time
34:21 though they have it you know it has a
34:23 link to slavery but honestly to say that
34:27 their problems today are linked they you
34:29 know are based on the slavery it does it
34:32 injustice in my opinion to the actual
34:33 events that have taken place the last 40
34:35 years essential Intelligence Agency
34:39 filled it with drugs and then
34:43 private president private for-profit
34:45 prison agency infiltrated the music
34:47 industry and switched it all out of
34:49 classic rap which was don't do cocaine
34:51 get your life together
34:54 talk too much those kind of wraps right
34:56 there were fun all into celebrating and
34:59 glorifying drug use the gangster thing
35:06 the fact that Kanye West himself was
35:08 told after resurrecting a fake gangster
35:12 called jay-z he had done his career he
35:15 was done Connie
35:18 mixes up mixes up a new album and just
35:20 blows up his career he's like I want to
35:23 be a rapper and they're like you can't
35:24 you're not hard enough
35:27 the dude rapped about Jesus from day one
35:30 and put one top-ten album left another
35:34 album lover Adam who's been very
35:38 successful not being dark at least in
35:41 the traditional way rain he talks about
35:44 his emotions you know he talks about
35:46 stuff that you're not supposed to talk
35:47 about I really do believe that we
35:53 control where we go I said a long time
35:56 ago five years ago I said you pick your
35:58 next second so pick it well it takes
36:03 some thinking sometimes the knit you
36:07 have to think about how we think and
36:10 what I have to do is think about the
36:11 words that come out of my mouth
36:12 sometimes you know this show
36:17 this is what blows my mind I've said it
36:19 once before but more than once it has
36:23 allowed me to re-engineer myself and it
36:27 wouldn't be possible without two factors
36:31 one me having to listen to the episodes
36:34 twice writes I make him that take him in
36:36 the editing room and edit them all
36:40 pauses out clearing my throat or
36:42 whatever it's funny I sound perfect on
36:44 the on the final product but you know
36:47 I'll I'll eat some food and I come out
36:50 in an episode I got like flam because I
36:52 some dairy product or something like
36:54 that
36:54 you
36:55 anything gun but the that's probably
36:59 like let's say thirty percent of the
37:02 correction algorithm does me having to
37:04 hear myself and go god cut that out it's
37:07 you know stupid the seventy percent is
37:12 listening to you react to what I say and
37:17 you correcting me and you disagreeing
37:18 with me and but you're being kind enough
37:20 to stick around after you disagree but
37:24 even the ones that never come back they
37:26 still affect me you know I don't really
37:28 care if someone likes me
37:30 necessarily I gotta be true to myself
37:32 but if I'm too relaxed with what I'm
37:39 saying
37:40 don't source anything and I'm saying
37:43 well enough I get angry in an episode
37:49 [Music]
37:51 it's allowed me to check myself to see
37:54 where I'm going like it's a Titanic rate
37:57 or an Olympic you know I'm just kind of
37:59 guiding as long as big boat but what's
38:02 interesting about humanity is if you
38:05 really gain clarity on on an issue in
38:08 your own life but she's something you
38:11 don't like you can about-face overnight
38:16 like in a second you can just make a
38:18 decision I don't like this anymore
38:20 a buddy of mine yeah super intelligent
38:23 guy I smoked with them and he's always
38:29 interested in like the metaphysics of
38:32 the mind and and he really has done a
38:35 lot of self analysis and about three
38:38 years ago
38:41 his life was just not going where he
38:45 wanted it to go I'll leave out all the
38:49 specifics of course but he we have a
38:52 mutual friend between the three of us
38:54 there's a bunch of us in this area
38:56 they're all friends probably he doesn't
38:58 have us right they don't live here
38:59 they're coming in from LA Japan all sort
39:02 of places but we see him everybody
39:04 regularly attorneys from he or come here
39:08 and he got into a business venture with
39:15 one of our mutual friends and for
39:18 reasons that had really nothing to do
39:19 with them it didn't work out but he
39:23 tells the story that because our other
39:29 mutual friends with psychologists he's a
39:30 brilliant guy
39:32 it's Chinese guy all-american brilliant
39:36 dude he's affected me permanently in my
39:38 life I've passed on a lot of things that
39:41 his name's John but he was listening to
39:46 our mutual friend who's all better-known
39:49 kind of whining complain about life it's
39:52 been going on for a couple years was
39:54 three years ago where maybe two years
39:56 ago whatever it lasted for like years in
39:59 a funk right and so our friend John laid
40:03 into him this is the way a story is told
40:05 I wasn't there laid into him and I don't
40:08 know what he said this is kind of
40:09 material but he was just saying you know
40:13 what's wrong with you and he Dom boom
40:14 boom boom boom and John's like been
40:16 every recent psychologist and he did
40:17 part-time for a while helping prisoners
40:20 you know rehabilitate in the prisons and
40:22 so he's seen the dark side of light he's
40:24 in the positive part life but he read
40:27 our friend the right act and the way
40:30 that my friend responded was that he
40:33 just he's super smart right he's just
40:35 kind of like instead of fighting you who
40:38 so I'm talking from my friend he goes
40:39 instead of fighting you I'm just gonna
40:41 agree with you he goes you know what
40:42 because you're right and all this comes
40:46 trucks of criticism you got worked my
40:50 fringe is yeah you're right I need to
40:54 knock it off I'm being you know I'm
40:56 gonna I'm gonna pick a word here he
40:58 probably didn't say but it was sort of
41:00 when these things like how being a [ __ ]
41:01 you know it's like I'm being a whiny
41:04 person and I just need to get myself out
41:06 his funk and here's interesting thing he
41:10 cleaned up pretty immediately because
41:14 he's got that command over himself and
41:16 his life has been better ever since it's
41:21 no one's life is perfect but he is
41:24 definitely in a much better place today
41:26 and now he wants to make some changes to
41:30 his life he's done all kinds of stuff in
41:32 his life he has a life very similar to
41:34 mine in completely different disciplines
41:36 he's had all kinds of things in his
41:38 lifetime the reason why taya story is
41:41 that he's picking the positive seconds
41:43 next instead of the negative seconds and
41:47 it's so easy right now to be overwhelmed
41:51 with the negativity because typically
41:53 human beings you know the world's upset
41:55 about police brutality it's very real
42:01 and you know again it's a minor probably
42:05 less than 50% it's not way below 50% a
42:10 group of police officers are having this
42:13 issue where they're just gung-ho need to
42:15 pull their trigger you know the second
42:18 I'm gonna bet some are probably
42:20 absolutely perverts and weirdos where
42:23 they enjoy racking up a death count but
42:27 these the guy in Atlanta I'm gonna
42:30 assume the guy that pulled the trigger
42:33 shot the guy in the back from 20 feet
42:35 away
42:35 I wonder how macho he feels today with
42:41 no job what how macho he's gonna feel
42:45 when he goes to prison for killing this
42:46 guy I mean if he does he doesn't that
42:49 whole city's burn to the [ __ ] ground
42:51 I'll tell you what you know but we tend
42:55 to want to fix things right if you
42:58 walked out from your bed
43:00 room into your front room in some
43:01 chaotic situations going on in your
43:03 front room this is your home
43:04 you don't to be in a world of chaos you
43:07 know but it's interesting you know I've
43:12 got friends all over the place today you
43:15 know into these hardships because the
43:18 banks are taking advantage of all this
43:20 Co good stuff to stick us with all these
43:22 interest bills and stuff they may not
43:24 make you owe anything on your credit
43:26 card but they're just compounding the
43:28 interest on your cards just a criminal
43:30 activity right our governor least of my
43:34 state California has made it impossible
43:36 for ninety percent of businesses to open
43:39 up you pay the pay the bills right but
43:43 we're still on the hook for our bills
43:46 the [ __ ] how can you how can you mandate
43:49 from a government level that we can't
43:51 make money and then these banks get the
43:54 roll-up you know interest rates on this
43:57 by the way there's something weird going
43:59 on in the world right now at least in
44:03 the United States of America you can
44:05 tell me if it's going on in your area so
44:08 for Americans we have something called
44:10 4th of July I'm sure you're familiar
44:13 with it even if you haven't been here
44:16 one time but it's where we celebrate our
44:18 day of independence from Europe and
44:23 typically 30 years ago we had fireworks
44:28 and we go buy fireworks these little
44:31 stands and then have a little show in
44:33 front of our house or whatever harmful
44:35 harmless crap right you're getting
44:38 bigger and bigger but we have Mexico
44:40 just you know to ourself so in my
44:44 neighborhood all year round someone
44:47 lights off a mortar shell it's typically
44:51 like consumer mortars him the little
44:55 tiny ones you can buy this at the normal
44:57 places but this year oddly enough with
45:02 all this crazy stuff going on kovin on
45:05 top of BLM the ulema topic ovid whatever
45:08 my neighborhood
45:11 we have at least four different
45:14 locations within tenth of a mile where
45:17 I'm sitting
45:17 tenth of month nothing right across the
45:20 street behind the church
45:21 one house caddy corner this corner over
45:24 here and we have what's called little
45:25 Tijuana that's a Mexican neighborhood
45:28 one city block to my right they're
45:33 lighting off professional mortar shell
45:37 fireworks the other day two days ago my
45:41 buddy was sitting here with me and he's
45:44 sitting her talkin and all of a sudden I
45:45 see this gigantic light just lit the
45:49 whole neighborhood like it's this time
45:50 of day right if they'd gone off right
45:51 now my backyard would light up
45:53 completely like daytime and then it's a
45:56 giant boom report and the guys must have
46:00 lit off four in a row and they're just
46:03 tea and tea man they're huge ray and
46:06 it's been going on for like the last
46:07 three months at this ridiculous level
46:10 way beyond normal those things are
46:13 expensive right so it's going on and
46:16 going on I'm thinking this is weird I
46:18 mean I've been here 17 years like I say
46:20 never ever heard it like this before
46:23 then I'm reading one of the news outlets
46:27 can you remember which one and he said
46:30 why are a bunch of fireworks going off
46:34 in the United States this year and so it
46:39 has reached an epidemic level all across
46:41 the United States I guess that this
46:44 article was written it was an Orange
46:45 County article I'm sitting there
46:48 wondering like is this some is someone
46:53 passing out fireworks you know like to
46:55 create more shocking or more trauma in
46:58 our systems and I kind of dig fireworks
47:00 but today I was in my office and these
47:04 are these are commercial fireworks going
47:07 off inside a neighborhood so they're
47:09 allowed to [ __ ] you'd be I was I was a
47:11 programing tonight and I probably jumped
47:13 twice in my office because of massive
47:16 booms going on you know really strange
47:22 I've always told you guys that
47:27 the ruling class have been able to get
47:29 away with a lot of stuff because they
47:31 allowed us to prosper as they were
47:33 ushering in their change luckily to
47:39 their disadvantage they broke apart the
47:44 family in the 70s again like I said in
47:48 Episode two episodes back if your family
47:51 is still married today and you're over
47:54 25 you are an anomaly if your parents
47:58 are still married I don't care what race
48:00 you are people don't stay married
48:02 anymore there's always a reason to run
48:05 away from marriage when if you could
48:08 just get through it no matter how bad it
48:09 is within reason I guess you've become
48:12 amazingly strong it's like breaking your
48:14 arm your arm heals it's stronger the
48:17 bones think you might look strange but
48:19 it's really thick and resilient to
48:22 breaking again in that location right
48:25 well we are now abused kids the kids
48:30 that aren't abused are the ones out you
48:32 know protesting for bad things right
48:35 they're not paying attention to the
48:37 agendas and paying attention to what we
48:39 want
48:39 they're just I don't know they're rich
48:44 kids running around a bunch of them but
48:49 today our eyes are wide open because you
48:52 can see this stuff and so what's
48:55 interesting is is they're desensitizing
48:57 us in 2020 at an alarming rate for them
49:03 now for us it is tumultuous rate cutting
49:06 off our jobs keeping the pressure on for
49:09 us to pay the bills
49:11 unemployment man you can't even get them
49:13 to pay you anymore I got friends that
49:16 are owed months like a friends are
49:19 working or getting paid unemployment
49:21 means this is [ __ ] weird right but at
49:25 the end of this year unless some other
49:30 super cat
49:31 trophic thing occurs when you can better
49:34 believe that Gates and Burks and foxy
49:39 are all preparing second leave the virus
49:43 just guarantee it I'm sure they've
49:46 already engineered it to be even more
49:47 deadly and more toxic and more airborne
49:51 and all that stuff they're gonna call it
49:53 a mutation but it won't be it will have
49:55 been engineered before that's why gates
49:57 invested in the the tracking software
50:01 last year before
50:03 Kovac came out it's so in-your-face man
50:06 it's so in-your-face folks that don't
50:09 believe this isn't a setup I'm not
50:11 saying the virus can get you because it
50:15 can they can't get you let's be smart
50:18 but they're gonna lose potentially
50:22 because we're picking a better second
50:25 because we're looking at the chaos you
50:28 know I mean think about this if someone
50:30 walked up behind you there's some
50:32 funny-ass videos when people did this
50:35 with audio not the real thing but if
50:39 someone walked up behind you inspired a
50:40 gun by you not right by your ear but
50:43 just in the room with you when your ears
50:46 have been ringing for days but you would
50:48 jump right like I jumped when these big
50:50 giant sticks of dynamite blow up when
50:53 the sky rate eventually just like when
50:57 they train a hunting dog know if you
50:59 guys know about how they train hunting
51:00 dogs the ones that point you know their
51:03 tails will straight out and they're
51:04 looking right at the pheasant or the
51:06 quail or whatever and then they give
51:09 them the signal and they chase him out
51:10 of the bush they fly up in the air and
51:12 you pop them and then you eat them after
51:15 you know the buckshot out of their body
51:17 we're firing guns around dogs and they
51:21 don't flinch way that they train these
51:25 dogs and it sounds brutal but you have
51:27 to understand these people love these
51:28 dogs more than their children if you
51:32 hurt one of these dogs in the South
51:34 especially will go up against murder
51:37 charges and you know the flat put you in
51:39 prison rest your life here on these dogs
51:41 just see no in case you're not aware of
51:43 how much these dogs are
51:46 especially after the trains but what
51:49 they do is they the first day they don't
51:52 let them eat at least one meal so
51:56 they're a little hungrier than normal
51:58 right
51:58 you know what dogs are like you mean he
52:01 could feed him at one o'clock and put
52:03 down foot at two and they'll bite your
52:04 hand off you go for the food right
52:07 goodbye each other so we don't they can
52:11 be what they do is they getting really
52:13 hungry and they put up this delicious
52:15 food and the owner will stand over them
52:19 with the shotgun when they start eating
52:23 they fire the shotgun over their head
52:25 and at first they get freaked out and
52:29 run away and then they just sit and wait
52:32 for them to come back for the food and
52:35 then I meet a little bit and then they
52:36 fire their gun again but eventually the
52:39 dog ceases to run away from the food
52:42 because they're realizing I'm not
52:43 getting shot whatever that sound is it
52:45 has everything to do with me I'm sure if
52:50 any of you've been a soldier in war
52:51 which I have not it will become
52:55 ubiquitous the mortar shell comes in or
53:00 gun fires happening around you you still
53:02 have they still have their they're
53:04 trained to have their minds on
53:05 traumatized so they can continue
53:07 fighting the war and hopefully I guess
53:09 when for the good side right that's
53:12 happening to us right now in 2020
53:16 remember when they exhausted out of us
53:18 al Qaeda we weren't gonna be scared of
53:23 that anymore
53:27 so john mccain goes off and helps form
53:30 Isis president at the time armed them
53:35 fund them funded them including a bunch
53:38 of a bunch of other countries but aren't
53:41 necessarily Friends of the free world
53:44 then Isis
53:46 got wiped out by this current president
53:49 almost overnight and the reason why was
53:52 that we always had the chain we always
53:53 had the opportunity and the ability to
53:55 wipe him out in the first place but they
53:56 were kept around to keep that war on
54:00 terror going and there's people that
54:02 want to start a back up again we switch
54:04 presidents to the other side you'll see
54:08 war start immediately my buddy said he
54:11 goes because I mentioned to him I said
54:13 look George Soros who will do an episode
54:18 on him in season six or the probably do
54:20 it this summer to be honest a lot of
54:23 digging on-air Kay he's been overt about
54:26 starting a revolution for service not a
54:28 revolution excuse me
54:30 a civil war a race war and a Savoy
54:34 however you can get it he doesn't really
54:36 care if it's a black lives matter war or
54:39 LGBT war or any war he just wants it
54:43 because then he gets to reengineer after
54:45 the crisis right and he's just he's just
54:48 the kingpin of the dark side right he's
54:52 the Emperor from [ __ ] Star Wars right
54:56 Palpatine
54:58 I think Palpatine looks a little better
55:01 than George these days but I was telling
55:06 him that you know that this guy exists
55:08 you didn't know he was most people don't
55:10 and my friend said some immediately he
55:12 goes what's backfiring I said no you
55:16 don't even know exist but tell me do you
55:18 mean by that he goes he was almost the
55:20 protesters are white
55:22 he goes this country's coming together
55:25 in the middle of this whole thing is it
55:27 spread to Europe and yes there's chazz
55:30 areas right I want to mention a video I
55:35 saw I don't think I mentioned it in
55:38 Joshua
55:39 if I did I need to mention it again
55:42 because that video was horrible audio
55:44 wise this will go out to the general
55:47 public first video I saw on the first
55:51 day of the Chas movement in Seattle
55:53 Washington was a obese white woman
55:59 sitting in a kiddie pool again this
56:03 supposed to be a black lives matter
56:04 thing right let's focus guys let's
56:07 actually solve a problem let's talk
56:08 about the issues like I did there's one
56:12 voice right
56:13 there's obese white girl is sitting
56:18 inside of a kiddie pool it's kind of a
56:20 round rectangle it's pretty big actually
56:23 and another white girl has walked up to
56:27 her dressed in black wearing a black
56:29 skirt apparently doesn't any panties on
56:32 there's gonna be graphic but you need to
56:35 hear this because this is what's going
56:36 on this is where people just don't have
56:41 it together right she starts urinating
56:45 on this woman's face and she is there in
56:50 the pool to be urinated on I know if
56:54 it's an anti white privilege then I
56:56 don't know what it is it goes on forever
56:58 like this woman must have drink I don't
57:00 know a five gallon bottle of water to
57:03 pull this off if that wasn't gross
57:06 enough and it's in public okay
57:10 Seattle what the hell's wrong with you
57:12 men I supposedly have relatives up there
57:16 never been she gets done before this
57:21 woman can straighten herself out and
57:23 she's now swimming in it right to degree
57:26 she's totally naked this stream comes
57:30 out from the left side of a camera and a
57:32 man thinking that oh hey I have to go to
57:36 the bathroom and you know this is pool
57:39 urine as well I can't find the porta
57:40 potty and this is totally appropriate
57:42 public display I assume children or
57:46 somewhere in the region he starts
57:49 urinating on her and she's more than
57:52 happy
57:53 adjusts her body to get the full impact
57:55 of this guy Peter Hobson just came out
58:00 with a brand new tune called kumbaya and
58:03 in the lyrics he had the song done
58:07 before this happened but he talks about
58:09 perverts wanted to be peed on area in
58:12 the first verse I'm sitting there going
58:14 dude he's over he's like an Africa or
58:17 now he's over enough sorry he was in
58:19 Asia Thailand or something he's walking
58:25 with these elephants it's amazing video
58:27 he's walking with Elvis and these
58:29 elephants are like we're with him he's
58:31 the coolest dude in this whole jungle
58:32 and he's just doing his round it's just
58:34 phenomenal I posted on the Facebook page
58:36 I can't tell you how profound it was he
58:38 has a great line where he talks about
58:42 Biggie and Tupac getting killed and he
58:46 goes it's okay because with me you got
58:48 him it's like they're both back it's
58:50 like damn so on it yeah so we got these
58:53 I don't know man I mean call me
59:00 old-fashioned but I think we need to
59:03 have some morals in his planet I've done
59:06 the moral morali episode by the way it
59:08 was a trivia question on the Facebook
59:09 page about a year ago I said what
59:11 episode have I done twice but I didn't
59:14 realize I'd done twice and it was the
59:16 morality of the so there's two morality
59:18 episodes and I forgotten I already done
59:20 one apparently it was very important to
59:22 me right I'm always beating at the Bay
59:25 Area and I always have to kind of
59:27 qualify it again because local Bay Area
59:30 is what it is but it's infiltrated by
59:34 other Americans you're just there to
59:35 come take money and go home or send the
59:38 money back home or whatever they don't
59:39 give a crap about anybody locally give
59:41 about crap about the culture the city or
59:43 anything right what is probably
59:46 de-facto above Los Angeles and above New
59:50 York and above any other place in United
59:52 States the capital for homelessness
59:54 because there's a big virtue signaling
59:56 population there that you know likes it
59:59 I kind of like it don't like the feces
60:02 everywhere but they like though like
60:03 yeah did I tell you I gave a homeless
60:05 person
60:07 and we should have programs to help
60:09 people when I moved back down here I got
60:12 clients up there I went up there
60:14 probably told this one story three years
60:16 ago but it was an early morning thing
60:19 we're staying in Union Union Square in
60:21 this boutique hotel but we needed to
60:24 walk about and about five or six blocks
60:26 south tip of the client in San Francisco
60:29 it's it's beautiful place we're just
60:31 walking through it it's like this
60:32 amazing place and I get downtown right
60:36 on Market Street which is the diagonal
60:39 street that goes to the city famous tree
60:41 goes up to that TransAmerican Bank
60:44 that's the big pyramid you know it's
60:48 early morning it's freezing we wouldn't
60:51 got some donuts were walking there and
60:53 there's homeless dudes and you know
60:57 everyone's walking to work so they're
60:58 panhandling because it's a good good
61:00 time to get money makes sense to me okay
61:05 but I saw both days I was there and this
61:09 one particular visit was that parents
61:13 are walking their daughters through this
61:16 one area and these homeless guys
61:19 multiple okay
61:21 were yelling pedophilia statements at
61:27 the parents about what they'd like to do
61:28 the girls
61:29 I can't even repeat I could not repeat
61:33 what they said otherwise this video
61:35 would get banned and a lot of you would
61:37 never come back because it was so
61:39 graphic it would probably make Jeffrey
61:43 Epstein look like the Pope all right and
61:47 that little girl was hearing that I
61:52 don't even know what the parent would
61:55 say as a result of that comment because
62:00 it was so perverted that child no grown
62:03 woman should have to hear what this dude
62:05 when a couple guys were saying it's
62:09 infuriating that we have situations
62:13 where people get so feral there that
62:17 they're thinking those statements at
62:19 all willing to say it out loud and then
62:22 say it to a child like who would give
62:26 this guy money after he said what he
62:27 said and the level of passiveness to
62:34 allow that to happen without kicking a
62:35 guy in a job me I don't know you can't
62:39 because they're they're mentally ill
62:40 it's not fair my kid was going to school
62:44 in a really nice neighborhood
62:47 brand new neighborhood I mean the cement
62:49 still drying on the sidewalks the school
62:52 had just opened the brand new right
62:55 every brand new all the house is super
62:57 nice and just to be drove through the
62:58 neighbor to be like am i I live here any
63:00 second of the day right and in her
63:04 school there was like a little kid and
63:07 he was just a little bratty kid but like
63:11 my daughter was telling you the line at
63:13 Disneyland that this kid was saying
63:15 stuff doing she was kind of like what
63:18 does that mean you know it was the most
63:20 graphic stuff I've ever heard I mean it
63:25 matches with the homeless guy in in San
63:27 Francisco his kids
63:29 my daughter's age and they must have
63:31 been like I guess if they've been what
63:38 about 12 years old or something like
63:39 that so I hear this and I'm like it's
63:43 like a Friday night no I'm thinking
63:46 Monday morning I'm gonna be at your
63:49 school and I'm gonna be in the
63:52 principal's office I need to tell me
63:54 everything the kid said I made her tell
63:56 me it one more time in a car where at
63:57 all then in my mind says blah I'm so I'm
63:59 so pissed I can tell you so I go the
64:04 principal's office with the list of
64:06 stuff got these two kids expelled not
64:10 expelled I'm sorry
64:12 suspended one of them should have been
64:14 expelled but here's what was interesting
64:18 the little bastard that was saying on
64:21 the horrible stuff he had a little
64:23 co-conspirator with him his parents were
64:27 obviously having some serious problems
64:30 how this kid even learned this
64:32 in a civilized neighborhood child
64:36 protection care should have been called
64:37 on this house man
64:39 houses kid even though this unique he's
64:41 got a big brother like what's wrong with
64:43 this family right but I heard phone I'm
64:48 like I even ha described it was kind of
64:51 encouraging but unfortunate the second
64:55 kid who was not the originator he was
64:58 the co-conspirator 18 back to get up I
65:00 heard through the grapevine after this
65:03 whole thing happened that his parents
65:06 showed up the principal I printed out on
65:09 my computer
65:09 he gave a copy of what had been said to
65:13 my daughter to the other parents they
65:18 both got like three days off from school
65:20 but that parent took him home beat his
65:22 ass and I said you know how how could
65:27 you dare mention something like this to
65:29 another human being so his parents were
65:31 good I'm sure that kid turned out good
65:33 I'm just gonna guess that kid learned
65:36 his lesson he's probably telling a story
65:37 out some other YouTube chills someplace
65:39 else right when we let go of society it
65:44 falls like a break instantaneously now
65:52 many of you've dropped something and
65:53 broke it it was perfect as your phone
65:56 it's your phone it was perfect you
65:58 didn't want to drop your phone but when
66:00 you did the nature make it hover and
66:03 those guy cuz it was artistically
66:05 correct no it let it hit the ground it
66:07 broke the screen broke the phone broke
66:11 whatever was broker TV when you threw
66:13 the remote control because you're
66:15 playing Nintendo and you didn't mean to
66:20 society is just as fragile there's all
66:23 those objects there are people who are
66:29 lost they don't know be told what to do
66:32 they get that they get that little thing
66:33 inside then a little sentiment you can't
66:35 tell me what to do those people are the
66:39 most dangerous people in society
66:42 and not the guy who wants to be free
66:45 don't tell me what to do because I have
66:46 on following the Constitution I'm
66:48 following the laws I'm not messing with
66:49 you don't mess with me that's that's an
66:51 upstanding citizen of the world whether
66:54 he's religious or not just don't bother
66:58 me I don't bother you kind of thing
66:59 right but you know there's two
67:03 hemispheres to that right there's what
67:04 they do to the public and here's what
67:06 they do online it could be very more
67:08 online a very destructive online but in
67:10 your everyday meeting with the person
67:13 they're the most upstanding person on
67:15 planet earth right well doesn't he did a
67:16 great cartoon with goofy driving a car
67:22 but you have to remember it like well
67:25 doesn't he he was born in 1901 you know
67:29 he got to see cars become a thing from
67:32 nothing to cars and so they found out
67:36 that we all have that lead foot you know
67:40 when you're young you have lead foot if
67:42 you're a boy anyway and you drive crazy
67:44 until you start realizing you have an
67:46 accident or you start seeing other
67:47 people's accidents you start thinking it
67:49 through it was a cartoon you teach us
67:51 not to be a lead foot it's probably the
67:54 name of the cartoon but now the lead
67:57 foot is a-- is the ever brave keyboard
68:00 warrior you know some hundred and ten
68:05 pound guy it'll you know say a bunch of
68:08 stuff that if he did in real life he'd
68:09 be pounded into the dirt remember i'm
68:13 gonna mention this at least one more
68:14 time here when someone is bullied one of
68:19 two things occurs and believe me I've
68:21 had my share of being bullied okay I was
68:26 fortunate that I had a chance to stand
68:28 up because I had no other choice here in
68:31 a fight it's like being a prison you
68:33 just gonna throw down you're gonna have
68:36 to throw down here lies you're gonna be
68:38 beat up by everybody else you know so
68:40 you either fight your bully and you find
68:42 out immediately the bully isn't as
68:44 strong as he thinks he is and you start
68:47 juice and they start treating yours
68:48 respect you actually make some pretty
68:50 good friendships in that situation had
68:51 that happen a couple times one of my
68:54 best friends in the whole world we
68:55 fought
68:56 our first thing is we wrestled you
68:59 pinned my ass in a full nelson but still
69:02 we had a respect cuz I didn't back to he
69:04 you back that was cool anyway the other
69:06 side of the game is the guy that can't
69:11 muster fighting back happens it girls
69:14 too right when you become the loser to a
69:18 bully you either become one of two
69:22 people you become a sweetheart because
69:24 you know what it's like to be bullied
69:25 and you're nice to everybody and
69:27 sometimes you can overdo that and you
69:29 get bullied kind of passively you don't
69:32 get the promotions there's a great
69:33 episode of Star Trek with jean-luc
69:35 Picard and uh next generation where he
69:40 was a bit of a bully when he was a kid
69:41 in the Academy he was like a tough guy
69:43 get himself into bar fights and he gets
69:47 a chance to go back in time cuz Q tooks
69:49 takes him back q from Star Trek and he
69:52 skips a bar fight and then he goes back
69:56 to the future back to the president
69:58 instead of being the captain of the ship
70:00 he's like a low low level worker and he
70:04 was like what am i doing and this like
70:05 blue outfits like blue turquoise outfit
70:07 and what I do for a living is I guess
70:09 this crappy job on the enterprise and so
70:12 he's like okay okay I need to earn my
70:14 way up to being a captain again so he
70:16 goes up a Riker and a few other maybe
70:18 counts hurt or whatever he's like you
70:20 think you think how you get promoted you
70:22 know you think I could you know become
70:25 an officer at some point as brilliant
70:28 and they wrote the character record he's
70:30 just like you know I I don't really see
70:32 you ever becoming an officer and he's
70:34 like he knows he's captain in his world
70:37 right he's like why this is fine you
70:39 know you're you're just not very
70:41 assertive you're not forceful you don't
70:44 have that Gump gumption that it takes to
70:47 become an officer to deal with hardships
70:49 and tough situations and he realizes
70:51 because he didn't stand up against the
70:53 bully at the bar which was an alien you
70:56 stabbed him through the heart and he
70:59 actually has an artificial heart you
71:00 find out later that Picard has an
71:01 artificial heart or whatever
71:05 because of that moment didn't happen he
71:07 didn't get his character and I think
71:10 that right now we're all getting bullied
71:12 so much by this deep state passage in
71:15 221 crap out of Europe there were all
71:18 kind of sensing okay first thing needs
71:21 to happen in this country is that
71:23 America needs to take some humble pie
71:25 right and my friend mentioned some that
71:27 he's born and raised here but he said
71:30 you know we kind of have a racist
71:31 platform in America of course I'm kind
71:34 of going okay and I don't know if I
71:36 quite believe that okay go ahead but he
71:39 made a good point he said look he goes
71:41 everywhere you go in the world outside
71:44 of America he goes people are proud of
71:46 their countries but they don't typically
71:48 say things like we're the best country
71:50 in the whole world because America
71:53 raises their kids to say were the best
71:56 in the whole world all right
71:59 Constitution does speak for itself Magna
72:02 Carta didn't last 50 years Constitution
72:05 is 1776 pretty good right it's actually
72:12 a declaration of independence but you
72:13 know we've had a couple hundred years of
72:16 some pretty good pretty good
72:18 experimentation of freedom but we still
72:21 should be humble about it it doesn't
72:23 make us superhumans to the rest of the
72:26 world most countries you know to speak
72:31 two languages English is usually one of
72:33 them because you want to get along with
72:35 the universal language of the world
72:37 again I had a British person say
72:41 something really funny they said them
72:43 well if you if you want to speak your
72:47 own language then you should invent one
72:49 and speak it but basically insinuating
72:53 that they created English we just
72:55 descended from Europe and ended up using
72:58 it right so if you're full-blooded
73:01 German for instance then you're speaking
73:02 at British language as a German
73:04 descendent you know a sort of thing
73:05 right but I think he had a valid point
73:11 we are now seeing through black lives
73:16 matter that we need to fix
73:19 our situation as citizens within this
73:22 country for everybody because there's
73:25 plenty of white people I mean again last
73:27 year the white cops that killed white
73:30 people was 49 and the white cups that
73:34 killed black people was 19 this is
73:37 official data read at a black lives were
73:39 out when that was out of a thousand
73:42 fatalities during an arrest and it was I
73:47 guess unarmed who's 49 unarmed why
73:50 don't--why you 19 unarmed black on white
73:53 or why don't black excuse me so we got a
73:56 problems all over the place no one's
73:58 immune from anything right and guess
74:00 what having not lived in any
74:04 predominantly black community in my
74:05 lifetime I have seen more white guys
74:10 belligerent and angry has results with
74:13 ingesting alcohol than any other race on
74:15 this planet and so when I rewind the
74:18 Atlanta Wendy's thing I know plenty of
74:22 white guys I could I could name them
74:25 that in their past when they were
74:28 drinkers big drinkers must have have all
74:30 reformed out of it in fact probably all
74:32 of them but had they been that person
74:35 that fell asleep in their car as a
74:36 result of drinking too much and they're
74:38 two blocks from their house they're just
74:39 trying to get some food and go home they
74:43 might have been fighting the cops too
74:45 thinking what the hell are you doing man
74:47 I I I drank too much
74:49 DUI me if you need to or just let me
74:54 drive home just let me walk home just
74:56 get me out of my car just treat me like
74:57 a human being
74:58 right and yeah we have all these
75:01 technicalities right we have all these
75:02 laws that anything and everything could
75:06 be an arrest right if a police officer
75:09 wants to use a minor infraction as a
75:10 pretense to handcuff here okay
75:14 my friend was zip-tied having gotten
75:18 pulled over that that story I told you
75:19 about him driving to Home Depot to get
75:21 some stuff to fix up his home like a
75:24 Saturday morning or something he just
75:26 happened to wear his clothes he's gonna
75:28 work him he's driving a really nice car
75:31 cop obviously assumed that he had robbed
75:34 somebody of the car and he's going to
75:36 Home Depot cuz that's the first thing
75:37 you do have to steal a car
75:39 he zip-tied my buddy and was going to
75:42 process like an arrest when the only
75:46 infraction he was able to find was that
75:48 the registration sticker was a little
75:49 bit overdue
75:50 that's a fix-it ticket how many times
75:52 I've had that ticket personally in my
75:53 lifetime probably three times at no
75:56 point did a cop ever get to a point was
75:58 gonna arrest me had enough to even get
76:00 out of my car but my buddy gets pulled
76:04 out of car my buddy gets zip-tied so we
76:07 are now at a heightened level of
76:11 awareness you know again I forgot the
76:18 NFL guys know I always say his name
76:20 wrong so I'm not gonna say it wrong but
76:21 the guy would big fro right here's the
76:25 quarterback who took them took the knee
76:27 and stuff my criticism back when that
76:30 was happening was why aren't you using
76:32 your multi-million dollars instead of
76:34 going to Nike and having some symbolic
76:37 commercial made where we're trying to
76:39 figure out what it is what are you
76:41 talking about right because again it
76:42 wasn't explaining as well as it has been
76:44 recently right take your money and
76:48 create your own commercial if I can get
76:50 it for free by airtime for free send the
76:53 message on give those case studies today
76:56 we have case studies were coming out
76:57 constantly the fact that any white cop
77:00 is running around just half house won't
77:03 even intentionally you know going for
77:09 the arrests constantly and going for the
77:10 confrontation I don't understand it I
77:15 just don't get it right now let's create
77:17 some feel-good stories right in my
77:19 hometown I think I've told you the cops
77:22 bought us minors the beer and half of
77:26 what was because it was a small town
77:28 they knew our parents okay the idea was
77:34 they knew who had the booze at that
77:36 point because they body they know where
77:40 all the parties are there's only three
77:42 or four places they occur but if you
77:43 just do a loop and
77:45 20 minutes of my whole town they'll find
77:48 out where the parties are they know the
77:50 miners sorry they just look at the 1
77:51 million I know your jr. you're a senior
77:53 you're not in college yet you're not 21
77:56 yet and you know I have a friend that
78:01 totaled a car on the way home totaled a
78:04 car her car and someone else's car
78:06 parked in the driveway drunk out of her
78:09 mind police officer shows up her parents
78:12 show up and the police ever said just
78:13 just kidding
78:14 no sobriety tests it's a little town you
78:18 can do those things in a blue touch well
78:20 they couldn't zip tighter they kind of
78:21 beat the crap out of whatever right she
78:23 would have been belligerent for sure
78:25 probably cry and all kinds of stuff
78:28 right so I think the silver lining here
78:31 for 2020 my my buddy who's crushed by
78:35 these things because he's experienced it
78:38 never been and his voice now on again
78:39 vicariously loving him it it saddens me
78:44 a level that's different today and I'm
78:46 glad it did he's optimistic though about
78:50 2020 listen exactly know why I don't
78:54 know why hopefully we're not proven
78:57 wrong you can be in a prison because you
79:02 did something wrong right you know that
79:04 works you get caught you go to trial you
79:08 lose or you admit you did it and you go
79:12 to prison and you lose a bunch of your
79:14 freedom maybe the rest of your life you
79:15 do something really horrible but you
79:17 could lose a lot just being in when
79:18 these private for-profit prisons going
79:20 for six months like I said catch ten
79:22 years because someone forces you to be
79:24 involved in something that you shouldn't
79:25 be involved in you can be in a prison
79:30 because we're all being disingenuous to
79:33 each other inside you maybe you're a
79:36 racist but you're pretending you're not
79:38 well that's that's a lie you're telling
79:40 to yourself you can address the racism
79:42 inside you if there isn't he or you're
79:46 not racist and you're looking at this
79:48 going my god I don't get it and you can
79:51 either walk away from it and say well
79:52 hopefully they figured out those racist
79:54 people and the victims of racism they
79:57 figured out over there
79:58 I'm just gonna turn my own life over
80:00 here which denies the existence that you
80:04 belonged to a community this years
80:08 taught us that organizations like the
80:14 World Health Organization which has lied
80:16 to us from day one can destroy the world
80:22 they can do it because there's enough
80:25 people out there uneducated about things
80:27 especially a viral virology that they
80:36 just terrorize their minds and that
80:38 becomes a frequency that we have to deal
80:40 with you know I have a lot of respect
80:43 for people were terrified of this stuff
80:45 because that terror in their heart as I
80:49 mentioned in my first cancer episodes I
80:52 think I forgot to mention in my redo
80:56 your body is pretty primitive inside you
80:59 know it doesn't understand why you're
81:00 panicking well you let your frequency
81:03 get crazy and that's why you have to go
81:04 down to a beach and the God talk to you
81:06 through the waves got to that place like
81:09 Joshua let the wind blow over all these
81:12 rocks and this is wild like low whistle
81:16 so soothing
81:18 whatever your oasis is my father has a
81:25 routine I don't know if he does it
81:26 anymore
81:26 I've been with him in many years but
81:28 when I was a kid you take a shower in
81:31 the morning take a shower stand up
81:33 shower in the morning he'd go work real
81:35 hard
81:36 usually in something that would get him
81:37 dirty and then regardless he would come
81:41 home and take a bath and it was always
81:44 his routine you come home and I hear the
81:47 bath water running sit in there and take
81:49 a bath and it seems so alien to me now I
81:55 don't even remember the last time I took
81:57 a bath you know it's like it's not in
82:00 this you know now-now-now culture it's
82:03 like a bath would you that's gonna take
82:04 forever
82:05 also to keep my bathtub really clean
82:10 but I think he was you know he was
82:12 surrounding himself with a body of water
82:13 and it just was very relaxing and chill
82:18 and I think we need to maybe relearn
82:21 some of that methodology just find out
82:23 what calms you you get into it maybe
82:26 it's an album music maybe so I got a
82:28 real inch album or jean-jean something
82:34 whatever whatever calms your soul have
82:37 it close to you some people meditate
82:41 some people pray pray and meditate then
82:47 matter if anyone else agrees and your
82:49 thing I find cigar is a little bit
82:53 soothing although I'm not smoking hardly
82:56 as much as I used to
82:57 I might smoke twice a week now but those
83:02 of you concerned about my health I'm in
83:07 a situation and probably a lot of you
83:09 are too I think I mentioned this during
83:12 the kovat episodes where there's so much
83:18 negativity out there legitimate stuff
83:21 and maybe some illegitimate stuff that I
83:25 think we're all getting to a point
83:27 probably once a day especially those who
83:31 are so quarantine and that kind of stuff
83:33 you need someone to talk to you can talk
83:37 about nothing I think most the
83:41 conversations I'm having today it's like
83:45 if we sit out like some of the dudes are
83:47 coming to my place now since I don't go
83:49 to my smoke lounge anymore
83:51 and we're probably about 2 or 3 hours
83:53 you know and it's it's at least third to
83:57 50% of the time we go through the
83:59 current events so we kind of yeah right
84:01 god what's going on ba this is nuts that
84:03 it uh and then the second half is like
84:05 you know stories about tell me about
84:08 when you open the music store what was
84:10 that like tell me about being a stuntman
84:12 tell me about your high school reunion
84:17 this is just anything I do when you grew
84:19 up you know what did you do in high
84:20 school was cool and we're all kind of
84:24 just having a good time talking about
84:25 nothing I'm not sure if this would have
84:31 happened
84:31 I had all this crazy chaos not happened
84:34 right and I want to acknowledge because
84:38 some of you made a valid points and I
84:39 tried to talk about this a little bit
84:41 with the Joshua tree thing but for those
84:44 of you haven't seen that episode and
84:45 tolerated it you know you guys are
84:49 concerned about the conspiracies behind
84:51 all this stuff that's going on
84:54 I've got a picture of the video of
84:58 George Floyd being arrested and he has
85:02 hair on his head it's you know really
85:05 tight you know black guys like really
85:08 short haircut but he definitely has hair
85:12 and then when he's being leaned on he's
85:16 got a clean shaven head and now we're
85:20 all going what the [ __ ] like how did
85:22 that happen right but here's the thing
85:24 I wanted to say to you folks which is
85:27 you know yes
85:31 people need to like the anons then you
85:33 go out and dig and dig and dig until
85:34 they prove something's fishy right again
85:38 like I said one of my most liberal
85:39 friends and Hollywood send me an email
85:42 and said why haven't you told me this he
85:44 says this thing's a setup for a race war
85:46 he's like believes zero conspiracies in
85:49 the world will fight you tooth-and-nail
85:51 about any conspiracies you might want to
85:53 believe he's got an answer for
85:54 everything and he's telling me a red
85:56 pill thing blows my mind this is this is
86:02 what happens when you abuse the society
86:04 it wakes up and you can't even not take
86:08 the red pill nowadays in most cases
86:10 right some people are still hanging out
86:11 holding on I should say but if stuff
86:15 happens this year that's rumored to
86:16 happen and we'll all be forced into your
86:19 drinking water the reason why I'm not
86:24 going to put a tremendous amount of
86:27 effort into this is one I'd rather make
86:29 that episode about Tesla to be honest
86:31 but two it really doesn't matter to me
86:35 personally I have to be careful how I
86:43 say this
86:43 so did you elaborate so you understand
86:47 completely my position so I think at
86:51 this point at least 35 40 people are
86:55 dead today as a result of the George
86:58 Floyd incident let's say it's a complete
87:01 conspiracy and that dudes a lot of
87:03 somewhere or they kill them off I think
87:04 they would kill anybody participating in
87:07 such a thing because
87:08 that dude shows back up alive someplace
87:10 else the damage to very wealthy people
87:15 that are in control will be absolutes
87:18 and they don't take risks like that
87:20 remember when LBJ was with his mistress
87:24 and the Mexican maid saw them kiss at
87:28 her house he's kissing his mistress I
87:32 looked down the hallway and that maid
87:33 saw this happen and he goes oh oh and
87:36 his mistress said oh don't worry about
87:38 her she doesn't even speak English and
87:40 LBJ said we don't take risks like that
87:44 and so a Secret Service guy took her and
87:49 killed her so I think George Floyd if he
87:53 exists as a human being he's probably
87:54 been liquidated by these people he could
87:57 have been told a bunch of things oh
87:58 don't worry about it we're gonna chew
87:59 this palacios mansion clip private
88:02 island
88:04 they don't take risks like that they may
88:06 have taken risks like that with John
88:09 Wilkes Booth back in the day we have
88:12 plenty of it and she died on a highland
88:14 outside of england having written his
88:16 family until he was in his 70s back in
88:19 the states but what's you know listening
88:24 to my friend especially today I wish I'd
88:26 had that conversation with him a month
88:28 ago or whenever this thing went down the
88:32 issue is real and we really need to fix
88:35 it so for me fighting each and every one
88:40 of these things it has its pluses and
88:48 minuses you know I will tell you that
88:50 one of the things that I'm getting an
88:52 instinct about which is me being totally
88:55 incorrect
88:56 maybe it's totally true George Soros
89:00 turned in his own people to the Nazis
89:03 for 15 cents a piece right there's an
89:05 audio interview of him admitting this
89:07 and saying well someone else would have
89:09 done it so I did it became he doesn't
89:13 look Jewish to me you know it looks like
89:14 a Nazi to me but anyway I'm some friends
89:18 who were Jewish to say you look
89:19 situationally
89:21 I have a lot of Jewish friends and they
89:23 look nothing like that guy not a single
89:25 molecule on that guy's face looks like
89:27 any of my friends faces right like a
89:29 family who were Jewish you know through
89:33 marriage
89:33 nothing like that guy but there's been
89:37 three black males that have been found
89:41 lynched basically hung from trees in the
89:45 last week and a half I believe the
89:48 number is two in California and one in
89:50 Texas I'm just gonna make a prediction
89:53 that well they might they might find
89:58 people who did it or whatever we'll see
90:01 could be someone depressed between
90:03 suicide but usually there's a letter if
90:06 that length stirs usually a lot of other
90:07 signs that they've been roughed up but I
90:10 wouldn't put a pass on one like George
90:12 to have that organized to catalyze the
90:15 situation that concerns me I'd even say
90:21 it it's just my instinct with that
90:22 situation everyone needs to take a chill
90:26 pill right we have an opportunity
90:30 outside of super nefarious people doing
90:35 more nefarious stuff which we know it's
90:40 gonna happen this year I'm sure they've
90:44 been trying every single day of the year
90:47 but they are definitely gonna try to
90:51 assassinate the president United States
90:53 and I'm sure he knows that and I'm sure
90:55 his detail knows that but it's probably
90:59 DEFCON whatever the highest one is right
91:01 I mean it's it's and that's gonna cost
91:05 if they were ever to succeed it would be
91:10 it'll make BLM right it's looked like
91:12 nothing right but you know I got friends
91:17 of mine who are predicting like you know
91:22 911s no no evidence but just predicting
91:27 it and I hope this kind of thing doesn't
91:31 happen
91:33 let's as I close let me just remind you
91:36 of the movie I reviewed in my men and
91:40 black episode which is the Close
91:43 Encounters of the fifth kind dr. Steven
91:45 Greer theory that we do choose our own
91:49 seconds and we can actually infect
91:50 others around us with those seconds and
91:54 maybe as perhaps the Mandela effect
91:57 reveals the universe is very organic
92:01 very organic for each and every one of
92:04 us in that we can pierce into a parallel
92:07 reality
92:08 that's better than one that we're in
92:10 right now everybody else who dials into
92:14 the negativity they stay in this
92:16 universe they stay in the one that's bad
92:17 with all the crazy stuff going on no one
92:21 ever finds a solution for anything so
92:25 let's concentrate let's take the whole
92:29 deep thoughts radio crap crew and go to
92:32 the better one
92:33 they're just contributing positivity
92:37 into our own lives personally loved ones
92:40 random people try to find solutions for
92:44 things instead of letting the negativity
92:46 manifest again a protests without a
92:50 message is worthless a movement without
92:55 demands is worthless
92:58 someone lamenting about policies that
93:03 technically don't need to exist you know
93:07 they're not part of the solution like
93:08 there was this recent thing passed the
93:09 United States I mean it's a good thing
93:11 but my friends who were a part of this
93:14 group are just laughing and they're
93:17 posting about it which is this the
93:21 Supreme Court ruled that you cannot fire
93:23 someone due to their sexual orientation
93:26 which I'm pretty sure that was illegal
93:28 before they passed this thing but you
93:31 know you know how it is if they want you
93:34 out of a company I'm never gonna say
93:36 they want you out because you're gay
93:37 they're gonna say because you're not a
93:39 good worker then you know fake a bunch
93:41 of crap about you and in that case it
93:43 could be racist you don't still like
93:45 your race and they're gonna just
93:46 say things bad about you they're going
93:48 to set you up to fail the promote you
93:50 too you can't handle the job which is
93:52 one of the most classic ones they
93:54 promote you give you a race and then
93:56 overwhelm you to the point you fail but
94:01 my friends in the LGBT world our are
94:05 basically saying this is absurd like
94:07 this has always been illegal you can't
94:09 discriminate against someone and if you
94:11 could ever prove that they'd let you go
94:12 for that reason you would always get
94:14 reparations for the retaliation against
94:17 your irrelevant lifestyle I mean like it
94:22 doesn't matter what we do as long as we
94:24 do our jobs right I mean to say our
94:25 lifes are irrelevant but you know so
94:28 it's a virtue signaling move to try and
94:31 create more support for a group of
94:33 people that really don't give a crap
94:35 whether you live or die
94:37 they're just first you're singling to
94:39 get your vote is it is the theory of it
94:43 fantastic yeah of course but again you
94:47 know evil people will do evil things and
94:50 it doesn't matter what the laws are
94:52 that's why they're evil you know it will
94:56 find a loophole not get rid of you
94:59 they'll fake financial Cataclysm and lay
95:02 you off you know I remind you too
95:05 because this has happened to me it's
95:08 illegal for a company to my knowledge at
95:10 least in the state of California to do a
95:12 formal layoff because they get some tax
95:15 relief by laying off they also have to
95:18 pay some penalties you know and through
95:20 medical medical Cobra programs or they
95:23 have to still kind of support you a
95:24 little bit on the outside or give you
95:25 some options it cost them a little money
95:27 to lay you off but they can't
95:28 immediately fill your position after
95:31 they've laid you off because they've
95:33 said to the state this position can't be
95:37 can't be sustained anymore because TV we
95:39 don't have enough money or the the job
95:41 doesn't need to exist right I was
95:45 involved in a company in 2018
95:49 or I was trying to help this guy get his
95:51 company resurrected just witness he just
95:54 never saw me as an executive which is
95:57 fun but he put a guy that's never built
95:59 a company before in charge of this
96:01 company who ran it straight into the
96:03 ground everybody hated the guy his staff
96:07 didn't even staff keep calling me sit
96:09 who was his guy he's your boss
96:11 yeah he's never called me he ran the
96:13 company so into the ground that a year
96:16 later after I got hired they had to
96:18 layoff 60% of the company there was a
96:21 fair huge huge staff right but then they
96:26 immediately tried to hire me back to do
96:28 the exact job I was doing as a
96:30 contractor but that was against the law
96:33 as far as I know
96:35 because Electronic Arts was always
96:37 really good about they had their own
96:39 legal department right they're like
96:40 seven attorneys at least and you weren't
96:42 pointing in the year and they would say
96:44 we can't leave often bring you back it's
96:46 illegal you have to go to their college
96:49 to learn to be a director and a manager
96:52 so again evil people will do evil things
