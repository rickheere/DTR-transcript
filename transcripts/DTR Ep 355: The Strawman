00:00 [Music]
00:34 hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome
00:36 back to deep thoughts on this very rare
00:42 sunny day here in Southern California
00:44 it's not usually as bare as that is but
00:48 lately we've had so much rain it's been
00:50 crazy slowed down the show but we're
00:54 back on track
00:55 hopefully not a single cloud in the sky
00:58 not a single plane leaving a cloud in
01:01 the sky well the kids do unless planes
01:04 make clouds right today we're going to
01:06 talk about something that's been
01:07 requested for a couple years and I've
01:10 mentioned it a little bit in other
01:12 episodes now some of you're gonna know
01:15 exactly what I'm talking about and
01:17 there's gonna be part of you that go
01:20 what are you talking about adjust my
01:24 levels there it's a little bit better
01:27 let's go at it now everybody he already
01:29 knows that's just you can get behind me
01:33 and sit in those and those stage seats
01:36 because you're gonna be the authorities
01:38 on this but let's break it down to
01:41 people that don't know what if I told
01:44 you that the second you were born but a
01:47 few things were to a few things occur no
01:50 matter who you are on planet earth one
01:53 you're immediately sold to the monarchy
01:56 of this world for zero dollars your
02:01 parents aren't compensated at all but
02:03 you become immediate property probably
02:05 most likely of the Queen of England in
02:07 most regions of the world so that
02:11 happens second thing that happens is
02:13 that you become the executor on a
02:17 fictitious corporate entity that is
02:21 called your person and your birth
02:24 certificate accomplishes both of these
02:28 things if any of you have your birth
02:31 certificate available most birth
02:34 certificates are contracts of ownership
02:38 that's why you have to have one I mean
02:41 simply recording when someone was born
02:43 all right should be in a database
02:46 somewhere to be able to call the
02:47 hospital
02:48 gets duplicated four or five times just
02:49 case the hospital burns down I think the
02:52 hospital in Wiesbaden Germany that I was
02:54 actually born in has been rebuilt if
03:00 you're a mysterious pop politician
03:03 you're your birth hospital's burned down
03:06 of course but if you look on this piece
03:08 of paper you will find your first middle
03:12 and last name I guess some countries
03:15 don't have middle names but you'll find
03:18 your name in there in all capital
03:20 letters and when they they the people
03:24 who developed legal legalese the
03:27 language by which they write contracts
03:29 in one of the distinctions in legalese
03:32 is that legal entities are always
03:35 written in all caps now recently I'd say
03:42 in the last 50 years or so it's very
03:44 common to have an alias
03:46 established at the beginning of a
03:48 contract which essentially can be a
03:50 mixed case so you could say client
03:53 refers to dot dot dot someone's name or
03:58 a particular company name and then from
04:01 that point on the contract when clients
04:02 mentioned it's referring to the legal
04:05 entity and that makes a lot softer in
04:07 case you have a gigantic corporate name
04:08 because you're supposed to write
04:10 corporation if it's a corporation so if
04:13 you had the United States of America
04:14 Corporation that's a big mouthful you
04:17 could just simply say territory country
04:20 whatever you want smaller word in there
04:21 and so what is this person all about
04:24 this legal entity that is your person
04:26 that even as a baby you're responsible
04:29 for that person and you might think well
04:31 that's not really true because you got a
04:33 guardian and your parents it's like mmm
04:35 well they have executor executive you
04:38 know rights on top of you as well up to
04:41 a point but think about it if you go in
04:43 as a 12 year old and shoot a clerk at a
04:46 drugstore your parents aren't going to
04:48 jail they'll be very angry and they'll
04:51 be shunned by society for raising a
04:53 [ __ ] but you're gonna go to juvie
04:56 whatever the maximum punishment is for
04:58 you as a child as what you're going to
05:00 stuff
05:01 and the way that they can arrest you is
05:04 because you have attached yourself to a
05:07 person and your actions go back and
05:10 forth right anything that you do it
05:13 becomes the the de facto log of your
05:16 person more than that your person is
05:20 obligated to do things go to school
05:23 you're supposed to do when you earn
05:26 money report your money it's all tracked
05:29 by your serial number which is your
05:31 social security number in America I
05:33 don't know what they call it overseas
05:35 one of you can chime in and let me know
05:37 but we have a serial number and every
05:41 time you earn money the serial number
05:43 tracks how much you earn which then
05:44 allows the old Jekyll Island 13th
05:47 amendment or 16th amendment scuse me in
05:49 1913 to drag your money out in taxes if
05:53 there's laws passed in your local region
05:56 or in your federal entity country your
06:01 person must follow those laws because
06:03 you are signed up into the corporation
06:07 that is your country your state your
06:09 local district but what is a corporation
06:12 what is that now some of you form
06:14 corporations to run businesses some of
06:17 you have a general idea let's break it
06:20 down when you form a corporation in
06:25 America we have three different types we
06:28 have a limited liability corporation an
06:31 LLC we have an S Corp and we have a C
06:35 Corp and those are the three levels
06:37 going up from bottom a C Corp would be a
06:40 gigantic corporation like a Walt Disney
06:42 an S Corp is sort of your buddy with
06:44 about 50 employees or so and your LLC
06:47 could be you and your brother your
06:50 sister whatever starting a little
06:52 clothing company now depending on your
06:55 state if you had zero fee for creating
07:01 an LLC you live in Delaware Texas Nevada
07:07 I'm not sure which ones are free anymore
07:10 but if you had a free corporation
07:13 that you could create you should always
07:15 create one for yourself if you're in any
07:17 type of business especially an LLC
07:21 because what it allows you to do is you
07:24 create the separate entity outside
07:26 yourself just like the person that
07:27 you've signed up to from your birth
07:28 certificate with your little social
07:30 security not a serial number on it
07:31 use our birth certificates don't have
07:33 our social security numbers on it we get
07:35 it later after birth from the Social
07:38 Security Administration whatever but you
07:42 create a fake person your corporation
07:47 gets an EIN number which is exactly like
07:50 a social security number except it's a
07:52 little shorter and it's meant for
07:53 corporations it allows you to track the
07:56 taxes for your corporation as a separate
07:59 entity
08:02 why were these things created well if
08:07 you're Steve Jobs and you and Steve
08:09 Wozniak and you create Apple and then
08:12 one of you dies and then the other one
08:14 dies how do you manage Apple the company
08:18 how does it have an identity outside of
08:21 its founders well corporation allows it
08:24 to have its separate identity it is
08:27 considered by all means a per person of
08:29 certain of sorts right easy for me to
08:33 say now when it comes to liability and
08:35 taxes it's very interesting well it's
08:39 not a mystery to you that you creating
08:42 are committing a crime you're gonna have
08:44 to pay for that crime we're gonna go to
08:47 jail you're gonna pay a fine or both
08:49 maybe capital punishment if you do
08:51 something horrible right but a
08:54 corporation the reason why they call it
08:56 a limited liability corporation and then
08:58 the S and C have factors of the same
09:01 thing is that your corporation has its
09:06 own little veil it itself is responsible
09:10 for the crimes that it commits your GE
09:15 and you dump a bunch of toxic stuff into
09:18 a pit I tend to think their corporations
09:20 were initially created to commit crimes
09:23 because there's a veil there's this
09:25 barrier between
09:27 you and the actual corporation how many
09:32 times have you seen a CEO go to jail for
09:34 what the corporation did it's not as
09:37 common as it should be right the
09:40 individuals that create these
09:41 corporations know exactly what they're
09:42 doing but now when a corporation earns a
09:46 bunch of money that usually before 1913
09:50 paid the taxes of the country that it's
09:53 in once 1913 came around the sixteenth
09:57 amendment was falsely ratified which
09:58 created the IRS which which moved taxes
10:02 from the corporations down to the people
10:04 then they were able to collect a whole
10:06 lot more money the corporations had
10:08 already been written out of the tax code
10:10 so they had tons of loopholes tons of
10:12 deductions and it all went down to the
10:14 people and that's when you have
10:17 corporations reporting zero income or
10:19 zero yeah zero profitability again Apple
10:24 Computer back in the early 2000s had
10:27 grossed forty three million dollars
10:30 forty three billion dollars excuse me
10:32 with a B but only reported forty three
10:35 million dollars I mean somewhere in that
10:37 realm a profitability how's that
10:40 possible well one they have all the
10:43 payroll so forty forty three billion or
10:46 so let's just say forty to make it easy
10:48 forty billion comes in they pay several
10:51 billion out of their employees they're
10:52 also doing a bunch of purchasing for
10:55 computers and real estate and R&D
10:58 research and development all that gets
11:01 written off all the meals all the cell
11:03 phone bills every single thing that they
11:05 do utility wise gets written off and so
11:09 by the time you have to file your taxes
11:11 it's zero and that's why you know
11:14 chasing Donald Trump's taxes just shows
11:17 you how stupid people are his company if
11:22 he has a normal CPA a certified public
11:26 accountant doing his taxes that
11:28 certified public accountant is has taken
11:31 an oath to get these the smallest
11:35 taxes the lowest taxes possible at the
11:38 highest deductions for any one of their
11:39 clients
11:40 you me or a giant corporation that's
11:43 their oath and so by them actually doing
11:46 that correctly you have a bunch of
11:48 ignorant Democrats that say that he
11:51 should be paying tons of taxes no if you
11:53 want people if you're if you're a
11:55 [ __ ] idiot and you want everyone to
11:57 pay taxes because you don't understand
11:58 the sixteenth Amendment let's just say
12:00 that much then you would want to give
12:02 the corporate money to the people
12:05 because the people pay a hell of a lot
12:07 more taxes than a corporation and so
12:10 it's the way to tax the money the most
12:12 and that's what Donald Trump has done
12:13 and that's what Apple's done and
12:15 everyone does it if the corporation were
12:18 to pay taxes it's a lot less ok but a
12:24 corporation is created for essentially
12:27 two purposes one it's a veil of
12:29 liability anything that the corporation
12:31 does the hurts people is blamed on the
12:34 corporation and the people can just walk
12:35 now there's a an exception there that if
12:39 you commit personal fraud then there's
12:42 something called piercing the corporate
12:43 veil they can get through that barrier
12:45 and come after an individual personally
12:47 it almost never happens because the
12:50 corporation could always absorb the
12:52 responsibility in some sort of wording
12:54 on a piece of paper right but the second
12:58 reason why these things were created was
13:00 the corporations are different than
13:03 humans in one particular way if I gave
13:06 you a hundred thousand dollars for doing
13:08 something for a year and let's say you
13:11 could find maybe $5,000 in deductions
13:13 maybe ten thousand dollars inductions
13:15 maybe that's your standard deduction
13:17 then you know that you have to pay taxes
13:20 on the ninety thousand dollars is left
13:23 okay if you have a corporation an LLC in
13:28 your name and you'd had me pay your EIN
13:31 number instead of your social security
13:33 number and there's nothing illegal about
13:34 that if any employer says that they
13:36 won't pay your EIN number take them to
13:39 [ __ ] court because it's [ __ ]
13:41 there's no problem for their accountant
13:43 there's no extra work they have to do
13:45 they simply write a different number
13:46 down instead of your social security
13:48 number they write your EIN number and
13:50 they pay your corporation and you get to
13:52 battle it out with the ire
13:54 if you make a bunch of mistakes I've had
13:57 friends of mine that had corporations
13:58 and tried to work for various companies
14:00 and they said oh no we won't pay your
14:01 cooperation they have to it's like when
14:04 you go to pick up your your car from the
14:06 tow company and you want to pay them in
14:08 pennies because they're [ __ ] they
14:09 have to take your legal tender they
14:11 absolutely have to that's what you call
14:13 the sheriff and they come down there's
14:14 always videos of those people doing that
14:15 right you could pay in $1 bills they
14:18 have to take your money but when you
14:21 have a corporation what ends up
14:22 happening is is you give them I will put
14:25 this way if I paid your corporation a
14:27 hundred thousand dollars now you have a
14:29 lot more options when it comes to
14:31 deductibles and so now instead of ten
14:35 thousand dollars in deductibles you
14:36 might be able to put down forty or fifty
14:38 thousand dollars in deductibles well
14:41 poof that goes out to the companies that
14:43 you pay your cellphone your rent your
14:45 car if as long as it's mostly devoted to
14:48 what you're doing for business a lot of
14:51 those have been changed recently but
14:52 then your tax deductible also went up
14:53 your standard deduction went up but
14:55 anyway you would only pay on what's left
14:58 and then you're only paying your
15:00 personal taxes on fifty thousand dollars
15:03 worth of income because you cut a check
15:04 from the corporation to yourself and
15:06 that's your income so corporations allow
15:09 you to take a lot more deductions allows
15:11 them to be a liability barrier for what
15:14 the corporation does so if you make a
15:16 mistake as a human being you're building
15:18 something you're trying to put an
15:21 extension on someone's house you're in
15:22 construction you screw up accidentally
15:24 well if you have a corporation boom they
15:26 can only see the corporation you can
15:27 file bankruptcy and get out of it but if
15:30 you just did it as a general contractor
15:31 they can lean your house your car
15:34 garnish your wages all kinds of stuff so
15:37 that's one of the reasons why they do it
15:39 now for the average person who's trying
15:40 to do their very best constantly and you
15:42 never gauge in fraud then you're really
15:45 gonna run this thing smoothly but
15:47 there's a lot of people that create
15:48 corporations run them until they're
15:50 belly-up BK out and then create another
15:52 corporation and just keep doing that
15:54 over and over again there was a family
15:56 in my hometown where that's what the
15:58 father did the father would create a
16:00 corporation make some money buy all this
16:02 kids brand-new cars and then bankrupt
16:05 the place and then he'd pray another
16:07 corporation
16:08 and this guy just had a way of bleeding
16:10 it out these kids always lived in the
16:13 best houses with the best amenities they
16:17 didn't turn out so great but anyway
16:18 there's a method for that but now back
16:21 to the straw man I wanted to give you
16:23 that background so you understand this
16:24 person that is you the person is not a
16:29 corporation the person is just a legal
16:31 entity a product
16:33 someone has purchased you someone has
16:36 been given you actually and so when
16:38 you're born you have to represent your
16:41 person every time you go to get a
16:44 driver's license pay a traffic ticket
16:46 which what's being summoned into court
16:48 is your person not you personally as a
16:53 human being now those of you have done a
16:57 deep dive on this you will have seen
16:59 court hearings where individuals go into
17:01 court and try to lecture the judge about
17:04 this whole concept and they say look I
17:06 am NOT that person I am a free human
17:08 being and therefore I'm not going to pay
17:10 this fine I'm not going to go to jail
17:12 and really quick they learned that that
17:15 doesn't work so you're handcuffed and
17:18 they get all the penalties probably a
17:21 few more and it doesn't work so that's
17:26 where I want to jump over the argument
17:29 that's here which is that there are
17:31 individuals that believe that we need to
17:33 get rid of the person and I'm I think
17:37 that there are different things that
17:39 need to stop we need to make sure that
17:42 there when you're born that this entity
17:45 person thing is not some hidden
17:47 paperwork that is shrouded in in
17:51 misdirection when you were born your
17:55 parents need to be given this legal
17:57 entity that says this is your child this
18:01 is what your child's responsible for at
18:03 the various ages you know at 18 they
18:05 could they assume complete ownership of
18:07 themselves until then there's maybe
18:10 another breakdown but what we need to
18:14 stop doing is saying immediately your
18:16 property of anybody else you're not
18:20 you're your own entity you
18:22 responsible for yourself and you own
18:23 yourself okay
18:25 now what we can do and it's this is what
18:29 actually occurs but again it's it's a
18:31 lot more intense I think people
18:33 understand you need to join a country
18:37 because without joining the country you
18:40 can't benefit from the mutual spoils of
18:43 all of us coming together to donate our
18:45 money in which is called taxes right and
18:48 it actually is donations compared to
18:51 that when you really compare it to the
18:52 Constitution it says it's voluntary
18:54 right but we actually have armies and
18:56 police and fire fire stations and
19:00 ambulances and it's all networked into
19:03 this entity that is the United States of
19:06 America Corporation now I've said it
19:08 several times on the show way back in
19:11 the day but it's always important to
19:13 remember this Washington DC just like
19:16 the Vatican is its own sovereign country
19:18 hmm what's that mean well when you go to
19:20 Washington DC you're no longer in the
19:22 United States of America I mean
19:24 technically you are because United
19:26 States of America is around the other
19:29 entity but you're standing on sovereign
19:31 soil that belongs to the United States
19:34 of America Corporation so let's look at
19:38 that what's in Washington DC well the
19:42 President of the United States is in
19:43 there the Capitol buildings in there
19:46 with all the different branches of the
19:48 executive order of our country so the
19:52 Senate and the house the legislative the
19:55 judicial you have the Supreme Court very
20:02 important distinction here so imagine
20:05 that the highest order of court that we
20:07 have is is not inside our country it's
20:10 in a sovereign country called Washington
20:12 DC District of Columbia hmm Columbia hmm
20:20 what the [ __ ] is that right what is that
20:24 well Columba Columbus the Statue of
20:30 Liberty Columbia Pictures
20:34 another Statue of Liberty lady right
20:36 it's all related it's related to an
20:39 order out of Europe that actually is the
20:43 collection of money changers as I've had
20:47 it described to me Columbus is Columbus
20:51 is I forgot how it breaks down but it's
20:53 something of the Dove and so it is an
20:58 entity that has been around this point
20:59 it there you know remember the money
21:01 changers were the ones that pushed out
21:03 the Masons so once you control the money
21:05 it doesn't matter what you know once the
21:07 Masons essentially became less coveted
21:11 because man started figuring how to
21:13 build buildings and water wells and that
21:15 kind of stuff they had to up their game
21:17 but unfortunately for them the money
21:20 changers came in and realized how fiat
21:23 currency worked and they took over the
21:24 world
21:25 money's power anything that has value
21:29 especially the way they do it which is
21:31 creating it out of thin air I mean
21:33 imagine that they figured out how to
21:34 take one bar gold and turn it into ten
21:36 bars of gold being one is the principle
21:40 and nine which are fake fractional
21:43 reserve banking
21:43 so the Statue of Liberty is Queen
21:48 Semiramis also called Queen Ishtar and
21:52 she is the the dove symbol Christopher
22:00 Columbus is not his last name he is the
22:03 one who conquered the United States on
22:05 behalf of this cartel when princes die
22:10 was murdered they put you know Statue of
22:12 Liberty hand holding a flame above where
22:15 she died on the overpass on the top
22:18 saying we did that that's us
22:21 Columbia Pictures again has the Statue
22:24 of Liberty in there it's a different
22:26 looking lady
22:26 but you realize it's the same pose
22:28 holding holding there you go we fly into
22:31 that flame right well my buddies created
22:33 the first one of the first animations of
22:36 color of that logo so when this place
22:39 was formed for some reason even though
22:42 it's all Masons that form that place
22:43 right there pentagrams on the street
22:45 configurations pyramid
22:47 there's an owl which is the advisor to
22:49 Queen Semiramis and the capital
22:51 buildings directly in the belly of the
22:52 owl
22:53 I mean it's freaky the Statue of
22:56 Liberty's finished in 1885 the
22:58 Washington Monument finished one year
23:01 later delayed only because they ran out
23:02 of stone during the Civil War supposedly
23:06 I mean that's like 20 years away I'm not
23:08 sure how that all works out but it's an
23:11 obelisk right which is an Egyptian
23:13 symbol how does that happen
23:16 you know the Egyptian symbol was you
23:19 know 50,000 years old and we built one
23:23 here in the United States as our
23:25 Washington Monument Kennedy's murdered
23:27 in this weird kind of triangle pyramid
23:30 Street configuration in Dallas and off
23:32 to the side of where he's murdered just
23:34 around the grassy knoll is a obelisk
23:37 from the Masons commemorating his death
23:41 saying we did that the white knights
23:43 right and we get to off on a tangent but
23:46 I need you to understand that the
23:47 underbelly of everything that's sort of
23:50 the foundation of this country is wonky
23:52 as [ __ ] now when you read the
23:55 Declaration of Independence and the
23:57 Constitution and you look at some of the
23:59 behaviors that were initially this
24:02 country you know in terms of there's two
24:07 things that were seriously unfortunate
24:09 one is obviously slavery back in those
24:12 days you know from when Europe viewed
24:16 Africa they taught their people that
24:19 these individuals because they didn't
24:21 have the science that Europe had weren't
24:23 human beings and could be sold bought
24:25 and sold thanks to the Obama
24:27 administration they're now selling them
24:29 again in Libya the other one was that we
24:33 simply carried over the sort of
24:37 oppression of women so the suffrage
24:40 movement continued clear until the 20th
24:43 century
24:43 eventually we popped out of that and of
24:46 course there were several stages of
24:48 getting people to accept blacks as
24:51 completely normal human beings thank God
24:54 we got past that in the 60s right but
24:58 the Supreme Court is inside of
25:00 Washington DC
25:01 the Supreme Court belongs to the United
25:04 States of America Corporation which is
25:06 not America
25:07 it is a separate entity that is the
25:11 legal entity that is this country but
25:15 it's ruled on by people that don't exist
25:17 in the country right okay it's kind of
25:21 like who's on first right have you ever
25:24 wondered how someone could reinterpret
25:26 the Constitution of the United States in
25:28 a court of law when it's beautifully
25:31 written in the Constitution freedom of
25:34 speech is the freedom of speech the
25:36 right to bear arms is the right to bear
25:38 arms but we still have to do all kinds
25:41 of weird [ __ ] this fake assassination
25:44 attempt on Reagan which is really to
25:47 send that guy a signal because what was
25:49 he doing he was investigating the
25:51 Federal Reserve he sent off as far as I
25:53 know three dudes to figure out of all
25:55 the money we pay the Federal Reserve in
25:58 outstanding debt how much of our money
26:01 goes towards the principal debt meaning
26:02 what you really borrowed and how much
26:03 goes towards the interest and his dudes
26:07 came back and as I've heard it reported
26:08 several times from several sources they
26:11 told him well President Reagan we
26:14 haven't paid on the principle of our
26:15 debt since around 1952 to 54 somewhere
26:18 in there we're gonna have to go deeper
26:19 to figure out exactly when it cut off
26:21 but we haven't paid on it for decades
26:23 well it took this kid Hinckley who was a
26:27 mental institution patient patient who
26:30 was only let out on weekends to have
26:31 lunch and dinner with his parents and to
26:34 get him wherever Reagan is and of course
26:37 he pulls out this peashooter and starts
26:39 just firing in the air Brady is shot in
26:42 the temple and then we got the Brady
26:45 Bill which is that we all have to wait
26:46 seven days to buy a weapon now I can say
26:49 just knowing people that have had better
26:51 loose cannons and they're just dangerous
26:55 human beings the Brady Bill definitely
26:57 protects us against that layer of crazy
26:58 or someone's just out of their mind and
27:01 they want to buy a gun to shoot somebody
27:02 that's that is a decent mechanism the
27:06 unfortunate thing is that's a fraction
27:08 of a percent of people that are you know
27:10 going out to get a gun to come back and
27:12 shoot somebody
27:14 and so most of us are penalized when we
27:18 just want to get this thing taken care
27:19 of you want to go to a gun show you want
27:21 to buy a gun go home with it and just
27:24 have it right away
27:25 but you know the Democrats have been
27:27 coming for guns for a very long time
27:28 because they're deep state operatives to
27:31 the max right again this is no mystery
27:34 to most of you if they disarm America
27:36 the whole world goes to [ __ ] and I know
27:39 that sounds super arrogant to anyone not
27:41 not living in America but the second
27:44 displaced topples and there's no one to
27:46 come save Europe from absolute
27:49 reverse-engineering tyranny and monarchy
27:52 it'll be thx 1 and 3/8 before you know
27:55 but we'll go through this Orwellian
27:56 phase first which will make the
27:58 Inquisition look like a day at
28:00 Disneyland but how are they able to
28:03 interpret the Constitution of the United
28:05 States that means Claire Isabelle
28:08 because they don't belong the Supreme
28:10 Court does not belong to this country
28:13 they belong to the District of Columbia
28:15 and they are they are following by laws
28:18 that go with the corporation what's a
28:22 bylaw all right how many of you've ever
28:26 played Monopoly at someone else's house
28:29 and there's that that corner square
28:34 which is free parking some houses play
28:37 it the way the game was actually created
28:38 it's simply free parking there's no
28:41 penalties nothing special happens the
28:45 way my family plays it is that every
28:46 single penalty that you have to pay
28:48 unless the card says give it to the bank
28:50 you pay it to the center of the board
28:56 when anyone lands on free parking that
28:58 person gets the whole pot in the center
29:00 you get a whole ton of cash and then you
29:02 get to blow up your hotels and
29:03 essentially win the game most of time
29:05 well how does that work you go to pool
29:09 parlors in America I'm not sure what
29:12 happens overseas you go to a pool parlor
29:15 in the United States and it'll be just a
29:20 normal pool parlor or they'll have a
29:21 little sign on the wall that says ball
29:23 in hand ball in hand is
29:26 ups the game a little bit inside that
29:28 pool parlor if you say I'm gonna hit
29:30 this ball into that pocket and you miss
29:33 the ball completely with the cue ball
29:35 it's ball in hand I means the other dude
29:37 gets to pick up the cue ball put it
29:38 anywhere in the whole board he wants to
29:40 and that means don't miss your ball dude
29:43 I come in here with some basic skills
29:45 otherwise you're gonna lose constantly
29:48 how does that work it's because you have
29:51 proprietary rules that go with wherever
29:54 whatever region you're in bylaws are
29:57 completely invented rules that you can
29:59 create for your corporation you can say
30:04 one of your bylaws could be you're not
30:08 allowed to wear hats inside otherwise
30:11 this penalty occurs to you maybe it's
30:13 you get fired and when you join the
30:15 company they have a whole sheet a
30:17 contract that you sign with the company
30:19 that you agree that this is the way that
30:22 you're gonna operate within their
30:24 corporate grounds right you have to
30:27 surrender your cell phone because it has
30:29 a camera on it Apple does this all the
30:30 time because they don't want pictures
30:32 being taken of their R&D you could make
30:35 them up to whatever you want
30:37 I used to write bylaws for a particular
30:41 eighties rock band
30:42 because everyone had different things
30:46 that they thought should occur on the
30:47 bus when they're setting up in the green
30:50 rooms and it involved someone could
30:53 drink wine hear beer there one person
30:55 wanted to be completely alcohol free and
30:57 so you had I had to write these bylaws
31:00 to keep everybody happy and quarantined
31:02 away from each other if they didn't want
31:04 to have exposure to the other person's
31:06 requests well I've never read the bylaws
31:11 of the United States of America
31:12 Corporation I'm not sure how one would
31:14 get ahold of those things but the
31:16 Supreme Court justice has guarantee it
31:19 they rule from this higher podium in
31:23 their brain this sovereign land called
31:25 Washington DC down on us which is why
31:28 they can say well I know you have your
31:32 Constitution you peasants right you
31:35 worked forever to get your version of
31:36 Magna Carta established in this country
31:38 but immediately as they saw
31:40 part of protection for all the
31:41 politicians that no they're just as
31:44 corrupt as [ __ ] hell right they want
31:47 this corporate veil around them to
31:49 protect them from what they do now I'm
31:52 not sure how it works when you become a
31:54 senator or a House Representative or
31:55 someone who works in DC whether or not
31:58 you your person has been adopted by the
32:02 Washington DC corporation I wouldn't
32:04 think so because you can still get
32:07 charged if you kill somebody if you
32:09 speed but there's all kinds of weird
32:10 hidden laws out there that no one seems
32:12 to know about most people in Britain who
32:17 are not woke let's just say they're
32:20 completely unaware that it is impossible
32:21 to charge anyone in the royal family the
32:24 Windsor family with any crime of any
32:26 kind so present Prince Andrew who's been
32:30 caught at Lolita Island with with a girl
32:32 who then shows up with Bill Clinton who
32:35 then shows up with Eminem the rapper
32:37 she's just like this little sex puppy he
32:42 can't be charged for knew that the other
32:43 weird relative that's always down in
32:45 Monaco throwing huge parties or he's
32:47 [ __ ] he makes Charlie Sheen look like
32:50 he's taking a nap that guy could never
32:52 be charged for anything that he does you
32:54 can't press charges against the Queen
32:56 now the president United States has very
32:59 similar protection and only impeachment
33:02 or this other section eight a 25th
33:06 amendment thing could touch the
33:09 president you know if he's mentally
33:10 insane like Woodrow Wilson ended up or
33:13 he's committed a crime like well
33:16 actually you know impeachment sort of
33:19 anything they want to have a problem
33:23 with right like Bill Clinton getting a
33:26 bj in the White House it's not really a
33:29 crime it's maybe morally repugnant to
33:33 people that believe in monogamy and when
33:36 you're married to a Hillary Clinton got
33:38 to give the guy a break what the dude's
33:40 a rapist you know he exposed himself to
33:42 Jennifer flowers you know there's almost
33:45 30 women that went up against this guy
33:47 and all 30 lost and then Hillary
33:50 supposedly spent a bunch of time you
33:52 know chasing him out of the country
33:53 threatening their lives just ask Anthony
33:56 Bourdain how about you know how that
33:59 works or mini-me
34:01 who happened to tweet about being chased
34:04 by her thugs or having news or
34:06 information on her and then boom they're
34:07 dead crazy got to be careful right so
34:12 where did this person thing come from
34:13 and can we live without a person hmm
34:19 that's where I want to really focus in
34:22 this episode because we we tend to you
34:28 know we well I think most sovereign
34:30 human beings and people that are awake
34:33 sovereignty is something you understand
34:35 now when I was a kid they could have
34:36 said sovereign to me every five seconds
34:38 and I wouldn't know what they're talking
34:39 about if they said well you know it's
34:40 you being free and even as a child I'd
34:42 be like I don't understand man I kind of
34:44 do everything I want yeah I got a
34:47 bedtime you got to go to school but what
34:51 do you mean sovereignty right so as an
34:53 adult you truly understand it when you
34:55 feel yourself being repressed anytime
34:58 you have to go through one of those
34:59 drunk driving lines in your hometown
35:01 it's so frustrating it's a total Nazi
35:04 checkpoint you haven't committed any
35:07 crime but you're being detained from
35:08 your right to drive right as you
35:10 followed all the rules you pay your
35:12 registration on your car you pay for
35:15 your driver's license and all of a
35:16 sudden they're going to treat you like a
35:18 criminal
35:19 looking in your face getting in your car
35:22 and of course a lot of these stops lead
35:25 to other things someone could be
35:28 completely sober but they're putting a
35:29 flashlight in there and they see dope or
35:31 whatever and they're pulling you over
35:32 something completely different
35:34 it's a it's a weird blurry line now
35:37 overall in America just to take a little
35:39 pit stop there we do have some
35:43 interesting protection the cops
35:45 typically can't do some very logical
35:49 things like hang outside bars now I've
35:52 actually recently heard in the last
35:53 month this is starting to happen in
35:55 Huntington Beach we have a huge DUI
35:57 problem and Huntington Beach and it's
36:00 partially by the citizens who live here
36:02 but mostly from folks who are coming to
36:04 the beach to get all lit
36:07 and then they you know they get busted
36:09 when they go home but we're not supposed
36:12 to be able to sit outside bars which for
36:14 me sounds pretty damn logical right you
36:16 see a guy stumbling out of a bar and he
36:19 gets into a car drive away and it's just
36:20 like pop before you even get the keys or
36:24 pray before you get the car in reverse
36:25 we got you because we want to keep you
36:27 from killing people right if your
36:30 vehicle registration expires in the
36:34 United States they do not send cops to
36:37 your house to seize your car you're
36:40 actually able to drive for I have a
36:42 friend who drove for almost a year and a
36:43 half on an expired tag and just they
36:47 happen to always miss the cops
36:49 unbelievable had this person been pulled
36:52 over they would have technically had
36:54 their car seized with a daily fine for
36:56 30 days which would have been really
36:59 expensive plus they prosecuted up to a
37:02 year in jail and they have to pay all
37:04 their fines for the for the tag itself
37:07 before they can actually get the car so
37:09 you know it could be a lot worse let's
37:11 just put that way but at some point when
37:14 people participate in society do we need
37:18 to know who someone is and then how do
37:20 we charge someone with a crime if they
37:23 truly do commit a crime
37:26 we have voter fraud going on like crazy
37:29 in the United States of America and so
37:30 folks are pushing for a voter ID the
37:35 voter ID is obviously required before
37:38 you vote now when I went and voted down
37:39 the street for the last presidential
37:42 election in the last senatorial election
37:44 I put my driver's license out there and
37:50 the ladies I got it on tape man she said
37:52 I don't need that
37:53 oh well two times ago I remember this
37:58 dude bringing in his it's a Mexican guy
38:01 bringing this old grandpa Mexico you
38:04 didn't speak English and he said us his
38:05 first time voting in America and it's
38:07 like really once you prove he's the
38:09 [ __ ] citizen first but there was no
38:11 need for proof he filled out a
38:14 provisional ballot which means you can
38:16 just fill in your name and your social
38:18 security number da da da we can get
38:19 social
38:20 security numbers when you're not a
38:21 citizen so the voter ID is extremely
38:24 important
38:25 what if someone murders someone well we
38:29 need a methodology to be able to put
38:34 these people in jail to hold them give
38:38 them due process and then if they lose
38:40 in a court of law because they're found
38:41 guilty got to put them in prison so the
38:44 thing I always focus on is this I did an
38:47 episode on politics I think it's in
38:50 season one
38:51 maybe it's in season two but I did this
38:55 desert island analogy where I built it
38:57 up from scratch saying what if we were
38:59 all stuck on a desert island and it's a
39:00 big island it's got enough for interior
39:02 crop growing and fishing on the coast
39:05 how will we bring this whole thing
39:07 together such that we could be a
39:08 homogeneous community because you know
39:10 that fishermen are going to need things
39:11 different than the farmers in the center
39:13 so when you harvest resources to give
39:17 them what they need right so your your
39:19 fishermen are gonna need things to make
39:21 Nets they're gonna need things to make
39:22 boats you need you know irrigation
39:26 mechanisms internally plows animals all
39:29 that kind of stuff for the center and
39:30 maybe you have a limited amount of
39:32 resources that grow out of the ground so
39:34 you have to get organized and create a
39:36 government if there's a dispute you need
39:39 a chain of command that goes okay I know
39:42 you fishermen are really upset but you
39:46 have some votes that's good but we had a
39:48 monsoon come through and destroy all the
39:50 crops in the center so just so you know
39:53 we have no crops going right now you
39:56 still have the ability to fish and even
39:57 though you're delayed from getting your
39:59 upgrades we've got to get the crops
40:01 going again we're going to starve to
40:03 death
40:03 do you understand and hopefully the
40:05 fishermen go alright god damn it you
40:08 know maybe we can take our other hours
40:11 when we're not fishing and come inland
40:12 and help you guys set that up quicker so
40:14 we can get our boats quicker
40:15 sounds great and we'll commit to the
40:18 farmers helping you build your boats as
40:21 soon as you help them get the irrigation
40:22 working because there's obviously a time
40:24 of day when they don't need to work boom
40:26 solutions so if you go all the way back
40:32 - sort of your Adam and Eve type stage
40:36 of life right you've just got a really
40:38 small group of people obviously there
40:40 would be no need for this person but the
40:43 second show you hit a hundred thousand
40:44 then a million then 10 then a hundred
40:47 then a billion you've got some issues on
40:50 your hands right Fenny have you been
40:53 following the crime that happens all
40:55 around the world by people crossing
40:57 borders illegally and committing crimes
40:59 on the other side because hey man it's
41:02 not their country it's not their people
41:04 if someone's a serial rapist well they
41:08 don't want to blow it in their hometown
41:09 they want to be able to come home and
41:11 remain that two-faced hero I'm a great
41:14 guy I give money to the kids but they've
41:17 got this rape fetish right and so they
41:18 go across the border and they commit
41:20 this crime and then they cross back over
41:21 the border and it's as if they don't
41:23 exist anymore
41:24 if our country doesn't have a duplicate
41:27 of all the person data out of Mexico and
41:29 I don't mean to pick on Mexico but I'm
41:31 just giving you an analogy then or
41:34 vice-versa even then how they gonna
41:36 track one of our guys coming to their
41:37 end committing a crime and going back
41:39 and vice versa it's extremely difficult
41:41 and then add an ocean someone coming
41:44 from over the Pacific someone coming
41:46 over the Atlantic
41:47 as long as I got a return ticket they
41:50 can deal this crazy [ __ ] and then go
41:51 back home hmm
41:54 now imagine you've got a bunch of people
41:56 named mr. Smith like right out of the
41:59 matrix it's John Smith - John Smith's
42:04 create two different crimes one guy
42:05 steals a pack of cigarettes and the
42:08 other dude murders a family of five now
42:11 they're in the legal system but they
42:12 don't have a person they don't have a
42:14 serial number hmm they're both are
42:18 brunette guys unfortunately they're both
42:19 meaning they're both the same not that
42:21 they're brewing it but they're both six
42:23 feet they both weigh 185 and maybe
42:26 they're born in the same year how the
42:29 hell are you gonna tell these guys apart
42:31 well that's the guy with the red mole on
42:33 the side of his cheek oh okay so the guy
42:36 knows that's the way he's being
42:37 identified so he's in jail he scrapes
42:39 all that off and it's gone ah [ __ ] who's
42:42 who I use the guy with a scar where it
42:44 was one you don't want that nightmare
42:46 on your hands and so there has to be
42:48 something that identifies us
42:50 individually so we can have a society
42:52 what we don't need is to be sold to
42:55 someone there's any notion that anyone
42:58 owns your person that's a whole
42:59 different argument now there are there's
43:02 another thing that usually comes along
43:05 with this conversation and has to do
43:08 with what's called maritime law it's a
43:12 very fascinating thing because it showed
43:14 up a long time ago when we were actually
43:17 fighting wars in the sea let's say that
43:20 Britain went down and kicked Spain's ass
43:24 let's just say that and if you're from
43:26 either one of those countries I
43:27 apologize for picking you picking on you
43:28 guys
43:29 but I think that that has occurred in
43:30 history so we can talk about it when
43:33 they wanted to settle the dispute they
43:37 the British wanted to settle it on their
43:39 terms right their laws applied and in
43:43 their brain to Spain and Spain wants to
43:44 settle it on their terms and so how do
43:48 you do that how do you get Spanish
43:51 people the king and queen of Spain or
43:54 the generals of the the proxy the
43:57 representatives of these individuals to
43:59 operate on British terms well the way
44:02 they used to do it is they would they
44:04 all agreed in the civilized First Rule
44:07 countries at the time but if you were on
44:09 the deck of a ship and the flag that was
44:12 flying on the mast was Great Britain
44:15 then you were under maritime law of
44:18 Great Britain but if you crossed over to
44:20 the other ship and you were in a Spanish
44:21 ship with the Spanish flag flying you
44:23 were in Spanish maritime law and so when
44:25 you negotiated a treaty you better be on
44:28 your ship if you want to get your way
44:29 there have been several millionaires who
44:33 have tried to live on boats because they
44:37 then can be in their own and their own
44:40 mind their own maritime law they create
44:43 their own country they run their own
44:45 custom flag and they say look maritime
44:48 laws honored all around the world and so
44:49 as long as I don't get off this ship
44:51 onto land
44:52 I am always under my own command and if
44:55 I say I don't have to pay taxes to the
44:57 IRS that I don't have to pay taxes to
44:59 anyone
45:01 there was a big and you know who knows
45:04 what the truth is but there has been you
45:07 know accusations to people like L ron
45:08 Hubbard who started Scientology being
45:11 off on his boat and he looked at the tax
45:14 code you know and he was furious about
45:16 the way that the he probably understood
45:18 that the IRS actually says voluntary
45:22 voluntary taxes from the citizens and he
45:24 was like look I don't want to pay those
45:28 taxes it's voluntary and you are just
45:31 using your brute force IRS agents to
45:34 chase me around now I second you form a
45:36 corporation you're definitely under the
45:38 veil of corporate taxes and you better
45:40 have a good CPA so you can write off all
45:42 your income it is possible to build an
45:45 environment with the corporation whereby
45:47 as the executive officers you don't have
45:49 any real bills at all you pay yourself
45:51 piddly squat because the corporation
45:54 itself can pay for all your food all
45:56 your amenities everything yeah as we
45:58 know from Al Capone you can't touch the
46:01 IRS it is enforced by the Secret Service
46:04 of the United States of America believe
46:06 it or not I've said this story before
46:09 but I want to repeat it again there have
46:12 been individuals that have done this
46:15 again there's a guy named is a family
46:17 that's named Green and I believe it
46:19 actually had an e on the end but I don't
46:21 quote me on that but he was a
46:22 meatpacking company here in America and
46:24 they ended up making hundreds of
46:27 millions of dollars and I think at one
46:29 point in the 70s they imagined managed
46:32 to amass I think near a billion dollars
46:34 in assets and so they started a bank I
46:38 think in Colorado and the son who was
46:42 just starting to take over his father's
46:43 business we then took over his father's
46:46 business it was a three generation
46:47 company he said that they got a visit
46:50 from the Secret Service right away and
46:52 the Secret Service said well if you're
46:55 gonna dabble in banking at your level
46:57 because of the power of fractional
46:58 reserve banking which is legal in the
47:01 United States of America you're going to
47:03 be able to parlay your 1 billion into
47:05 essentially 10 billion dollars in assets
47:06 9 going out in fractional reserve
47:09 banking methodology and you still have
47:11 the one in the bank they don't want any
47:14 comp
47:14 petition you're not allowed to be a
47:16 competitor with the banking cartel and
47:18 so they swooped in and said you're gonna
47:23 let us manage your bank let us manage
47:26 your money and if you don't like it then
47:28 you're gonna have a lot of problems
47:30 maybe even a accidental death or two hmm
47:34 we know that less than 10 years ago I'm
47:38 actually sorry maybe it's about 15 years
47:40 now they've been precious coins sold
47:43 online as legal tender some people have
47:46 tried to create their own legal tender
47:48 coinage to made out of gold coins
47:51 they're really worth a lot of money so
47:53 that you could operate your own currency
47:55 outside of the United States currency
47:58 Secret Service descended on them raided
48:00 their coin companies and it was over
48:04 even though it really is legal tender
48:07 because gold has value and you weigh it
48:09 and you go against market prices and
48:12 boom you have a currency if we were all
48:16 willing to adopt some rare commodity as
48:21 currency we could do it what do you
48:23 think bitcoin is right Bitcoin was
48:27 utterly terrifying to the cartel so what
48:31 did they do they watch to see how it was
48:33 gonna go legalese to see if it was gonna
48:35 collapse on its own and then they moved
48:37 in with massive regulations there's a
48:41 great documentary on Netflix about this
48:43 and the guy Ted from Bill and Ted's
48:45 Excellent Adventure I forget his name
48:47 he's a huge proponent of Bitcoin but now
48:51 there's like dozens and dozens and
48:52 dozens of bitcoins but they swooped in
48:55 they regulated it and took it over
48:57 completely we are legally and completely
49:00 controlled by these individuals and our
49:04 person which is our straw man our fake
49:07 sort of made-up entity of ourselves this
49:10 duplicate of ourselves and the legal
49:11 body of the world is what we are
49:14 accountable for because we have a
49:16 consensus in this planet that that's the
49:18 way the world is going to work but again
49:21 before you get completely you know
49:24 pissed off about this and there's some
49:26 people that really follow this
49:28 at a detailed level they followed every
49:31 single day and they try to they try to
49:34 fight it they fight they follow the
49:36 court cases where people go in and and
49:38 try to say you know I'm not gonna do
49:41 what you tell me you know [ __ ] you I'm
49:42 not gonna do what you tell me it never
49:44 works out they end up broadcasting
49:47 usually the court case somewhere online
49:49 so that people look really really crazy
49:51 who do this you know there are I don't
49:56 know it's something that you wouldn't
49:58 want to do unless you could get the
49:59 entire world to move into this whole
50:01 thing the tea party here in the United
50:03 States of America because I will always
50:06 remind you guys was over 3,000 former
50:10 IRS agents as I had it communicated to
50:13 me started the tea party and said look
50:14 taxes are voluntary we figured it out
50:17 we're no longer paying this crap and so
50:21 immediately the place was co-opted sarah
50:26 palin got in there just showed up to one
50:28 of their meetings and she was already
50:31 running with mccain and so she was
50:34 considered a loony this mom of five up
50:37 in alaska who's never seen you know one
50:40 moment of reality which isn't true and
50:42 they just said this is a cuckoo group
50:45 then they started that the thing that
50:49 people would say all the time when when
50:52 I was watching it which was you know
50:54 getting tea-bagged it's just like as I
50:56 said in the episode way back in 2014-15
50:59 I said you know if anyone looked up what
51:01 the hell that meant it'd be funny to see
51:04 the expression on their face when they
51:06 got caught saying it to their kids so
51:09 what is the motto of this show the model
51:11 of this show is always rebuild society
51:14 from the ground up so let's say that cue
51:17 and on is real we do get full
51:19 transparency with our government even
51:21 though we are completely spied on which
51:23 is a violation of the Fourth Amendment
51:25 of the Constitution we learn about FISA
51:28 courts and we sure up all the laws so
51:30 that even though they get a copy of
51:31 everything nothing is looked at unless
51:33 there's a search warrant for that
51:35 information all right would we still
51:38 keep
51:39 this legal straw men I know a lot of
51:43 people that wouldn't want to have a
51:44 straw man for sure but then again I'm
51:47 not sure how we would ever operate as a
51:50 society if I were to go 150 miles an
51:54 hour down the freeway and I just bump a
51:58 car I'm fine I keep going but I bump a
52:02 car and they oversteer go crazy or it's
52:05 a really massive transfer of energy and
52:08 they go in front of a semi and a family
52:11 of four is absolutely obliterated by a
52:14 bus by a semi and I am now responsible
52:17 for killing four people don't you want a
52:20 method to come after me and all I have
52:23 to do is say I'm not a person and you
52:25 know [ __ ] you done this sovereign you
52:28 know militia guy that's not gonna fly if
52:31 you're a relative of these people or you
52:32 have empathy for anyone else's life
52:34 right so what do we do to reinforce this
52:38 person so that we actually have some
52:41 means of identifying each other well
52:44 typically in the United States of
52:46 America the only thing we have is your
52:50 driver's license the driver's license
52:52 requires two forms of identification to
52:54 give it validity so you just can't get a
52:57 driver's license out of thin air
52:58 typically you have to have your birth
53:00 certificate and then again one other
53:01 form of identification a lot of times
53:05 it's your social security card or some
53:08 other institution that's vetted who you
53:09 are Linnell a driver's license comes
53:14 with the picture now at least they're
53:16 looking at me and going well you have
53:18 the same name maybe even the same
53:20 birthdate of some other guy that's
53:22 killed a family of four but I can look
53:25 at this driver's license and realize
53:27 you're not even the race of the person
53:29 that did that because we have the maybe
53:32 the traffic-cam of this person then I
53:35 get to be free instead of being
53:37 incarcerated for someone else's crime
53:39 it's a tough one right when I hear the
53:43 the petition from individuals who hate
53:48 this straw man person relationship that
53:51 we have with our country with the war
53:53 old most of it just has to do with the
53:56 fact that I am NOT your property even
53:58 though I might have this person I'm not
54:00 your property but if I agree to live in
54:03 a country then even if we don't we
54:07 obliterate the Washington DC we get rid
54:09 of its sovereign designation the town is
54:12 renamed - you know maybe I don't know
54:16 white house alley or whatever or just
54:20 becomes you know some state name it's
54:23 just called Washington we take off the
54:24 DC we remove the sovereignty that it has
54:28 well you still have to sign up to
54:30 whatever country that you want to live
54:33 in France operates different in the
54:36 United States different than the UK
54:37 different than Scotland Ireland Iceland
54:39 Australia Africa South America right
54:42 Asia so you have to pick what what
54:48 country you want to live in do you want
54:49 to live in a country that has a
54:51 popularity app that's forced on you then
54:54 you probably want to live in China you
54:56 want to live in a country with no
54:57 extradition and then you go to the 5i
54:59 headquarters which is New Zealand they
55:02 can get they can take extra tight you
55:05 there's no laws that allow it to happen
55:06 so you can sit there and be a rapist
55:09 from a different country and you'll be
55:11 in there now they may decide to charge
55:12 you for what you've done in a different
55:14 country but they as I understand it are
55:19 unable to move you to that country to
55:21 serve your time out or you did your
55:23 crime that's why a lot of pedophiles in
55:25 the United States of America go and flee
55:27 to these other countries because they're
55:29 I guess more lenient on this sort of
55:32 thing right is it your Roman Polanski's
55:34 right but once you sign up let's just
55:37 say we got rid of the bylaws of this
55:39 United States of America Corporation hmm
55:43 we have to solve for two problems right
55:45 away the Constitution of the United
55:48 States has to be reaffirmed by the
55:50 people this is the the the general Ten
55:53 Commandments the 10 bill of rights plus
55:55 it's amendments and I think we should
55:57 look at the 16th one very carefully
55:58 before we continue with that one well we
56:02 at least say the Constitution as it was
56:04 initially initially written the Ten Bill
56:06 of Rights is what we're willing
56:07 to adopt as our modus operandi as
56:10 citizens of that country of this country
56:13 of America that I'm sitting in right now
56:15 you don't like it that's fine you apply
56:18 someplace else and you move there you
56:20 better another language and you better
56:22 have a decent skill set that they need
56:23 otherwise you won't get citizenship
56:26 right
56:26 the bummer of the world is this because
56:31 we have bad apples which is created by
56:34 horrible education now it's created by
56:38 horrible vaccinations that rot kids
56:41 brains and you know again they've got us
56:44 from cradle to grave
56:45 right they give the kids vaccinations
56:47 which ruin their minds their ADHD they
56:50 can't focus their lifes get screwed up
56:52 now they push dope on all the kids and
56:54 then they start [ __ ] up their life
56:57 because they can't pay attention because
56:59 they've been genetically altered this
57:01 medication which is dope gives them some
57:04 form of like solace their brain kind of
57:07 calms down they feel like normal people
57:09 when they're on drugs but then they're
57:12 tired all the time I don't want to do
57:14 anything with your life education is
57:15 still almost impossible because you
57:17 can't go to school high out of your mind
57:19 and pay attention to anything that
57:20 they're teaching you and so when you go
57:23 right onto welfare you're Bernie Sanders
57:25 program or you're Cortez program then
57:29 you just become sort of a mouth-breather
57:31 right you have very little value to
57:33 society you want to try to find a spouse
57:36 good luck your spouse is probably
57:38 looking for security but any spouse is
57:41 looking forward to a partner that's
57:42 going to participate this is the whole
57:44 world's been re-engineered to be a
57:46 two-income household you're gonna have
57:48 to bring your half and if you can't
57:50 you're gonna be single living with your
57:52 parents forever so your parents kick
57:54 your ass out so we now have a
57:57 contingency of every population that
58:01 can't behave some people get beat up by
58:04 their parents because the parents are
58:05 having a hard times they take it out on
58:06 their kids and their kids beat their
58:08 kids if someone can't get partners of
58:11 the opposite sex
58:12 they start turning into rapists and so
58:16 all of this all of this are a giant
58:19 portion of this straw
58:20 man is in place so that we can handle
58:22 those people so we know where they are
58:23 physically we can go apprehend them put
58:26 them away it's it's our choice as a
58:28 society to do that to other people and a
58:33 little village well we'd probably just
58:35 kick them out of the country kick them
58:37 out of our little area right our little
58:38 village we'd say you're no longer
58:40 welcome all the guards that guard every
58:42 entrance to our village have your face
58:45 and name and printed in their minds
58:48 somehow and you're not allowed in so you
58:51 better know how to hunt and cook and
58:53 build the shelter otherwise you're just
58:55 gonna die out there which is where we
58:57 really got this thing called groupthink
58:58 right which one I probably didn't
59:00 episode on that eventually so the straw
59:03 man entity was formed because society
59:07 grew now what's interesting for me
59:10 having grown up before electronic
59:12 surveillance was essentially a part of
59:15 all societies right we have cameras
59:17 everywhere now and I think most of you
59:20 who follow the internet know that these
59:23 cameras have caught criminals that would
59:25 have normally gotten away this this
59:27 actor who recently faked his own beating
59:31 and blamed it on a bunch of white
59:32 supremacist individuals I mean talk
59:35 about scumbag the only reason why we
59:39 figured out that this was all a ruse was
59:41 that one he cut the guys a check for I
59:43 think thirty five hundred bucks
59:44 [ __ ] brilliant but we got him on
59:46 camera buying the ski masks we have him
59:48 on camera doing the attack itself with
59:51 no Mack Magga hats on so we knew the
59:53 whole thing was a lie all right what if
59:58 we didn't have the surveillance state it
60:01 sucks right it sucks that we've had our
60:03 Fourth Amendment compromised in most
60:06 cases now again if you have your own
60:07 convenience store you're in a public
60:09 place
60:09 filming you is fair game walking down
60:13 the street you're in a public place sort
60:16 of fair game if you're out in public and
60:17 someone points a video camera at you
60:19 there's a bunch of disputes about
60:22 whether or not that's legal or not but
60:25 if you're in your own household well
60:26 then it's your own household your TV
60:29 which has a camera and it shouldn't be
60:30 filming you and you don't want to your
60:31 phone shouldn't be listening to you and
60:33 it shouldn't when
60:34 you don't give it explicit permission to
60:36 listen to you but they still do it don't
60:39 think write Facebook is listening to you
60:41 even after you delete the app on your
60:43 telephone isn't that unbelievable and we
60:46 allow it to occur he admitted it in a
60:49 Senate hearing but that's what happens
60:51 and he wasn't immediately incarcerated
60:53 put in jail and their company frozen
60:55 until they stop violating the Fourth
60:57 Amendment now the operating system
61:00 companies just to go down that rabbit
61:01 hole for one second they absolutely know
61:04 when someone is listening to a device
61:06 because they are now giving voltage to
61:10 that part of your phone and sending it
61:12 to a listener an event handler that's
61:14 going in a big loop and then shipping
61:16 that data out through the Ethernet port
61:18 or wireless port that you have on your
61:20 device so they could absolutely stop
61:23 this the the latest Macintosh operating
61:28 system Mojave has a new security feature
61:31 that essentially designates permissions
61:33 per device so if you want to have a
61:36 device service your hard drive you have
61:39 to give that application permission to
61:41 look at your hard drive if you want it
61:43 to you want to do audio conferencing
61:45 with an individual through software you
61:47 have to grant microphone permission to
61:49 the application or the you know the web
61:52 browser application to be able to do
61:54 that so you sort of have a lot more
61:55 control when you're in your desktop
61:56 computer on a Mac currently I can't wait
61:59 to that hits Windows 10 when you're a
62:02 really technical person with computers
62:04 like myself you automatically know how
62:08 invaded you are and it means something
62:12 different to someone who's technical
62:13 because there's a technical person we
62:15 know how to solve that problem again
62:17 Mojave seems to at least be taking the
62:19 first steps to solve that issue now spy
62:22 software spy software I think it
62:25 operates in a hidden mezzanine inside
62:28 your operating system it can do anything
62:30 it wants to do look at your microphone
62:32 look at your camera and it's below the
62:34 operating system's ability to monitor so
62:36 you do have methods that they can get in
62:38 and take everything off your computer
62:40 they can technically control the router
62:45 outside your house to give you like
62:47 double bandwidth that you wouldn't
62:49 normally have if they want to yank down
62:50 your hard drive and then when you've run
62:52 monitoring software to see how much how
62:54 busy your hard drive is it won't
62:57 necessarily report it you just notice
62:59 your computer's getting slow but maybe
63:01 they do at four o'clock in the morning
63:02 when you're asleep when they drag your
63:03 hard drive down at night at some massive
63:06 upload rate if I were to take everyone
63:08 that I've ever heard in these town hall
63:11 meetings who know a lot more about this
63:14 straw man than I do
63:15 and some of these are exhaustive
63:18 research programs that people have spent
63:19 ten plus years dissecting all the
63:22 legalese of the straw man if I brought
63:25 them all into a room and said look how
63:27 are we going to have a society without
63:28 this stuff I am yet to hear one
63:32 presentation that after they tell you
63:34 how you're being sold off to the
63:36 monarchy of you know Europe Western
63:39 Europe of how they're gonna solve this
63:41 problem and let us have a society now
63:44 someone up in Montana or Alaska that's
63:46 living in the hills they they literally
63:48 hunt everything that they eat they use
63:50 berries they live like Native Americans
63:51 they're looking at us going well it's
63:54 real simple you just need to do what I
63:57 do but when you live in Los Angeles
63:59 which has you know roughly 25 million
64:02 people with all the neighboring cities
64:05 combined neighboring counties combined
64:07 then you're looking at it going well
64:09 there's a big problem here plus we're
64:10 letting in foreigners illegally to
64:13 control our voting to control how much
64:16 money gets bled out of the system for
64:18 free insurance all these other problems
64:21 then you're going to have to come up
64:24 with some mechanism to identify
64:25 individuals discreetly so that you can
64:28 even track a metric a real simple
64:30 analogy would be your that Alaskan dude
64:33 you're that person in Montana and every
64:38 day you leave your log cabin and you go
64:42 out and do your hunting but someone's
64:44 watching you casing your joint for a
64:47 couple days they're super hungry they're
64:49 out there in the middle of the woods to
64:50 and they realize that you go north of
64:52 your place two miles where all the deer
64:54 and whatever antelope roam right and
64:57 they sneak in your house they don't
65:01 break anything but they take your food
65:03 they take maybe just some of your food
65:05 they take some of your water all the
65:07 stuff that you've been working hard to
65:08 supply yourself with resources and then
65:11 they go back out in the woods and they
65:12 munch on it and they've got a little
65:13 tiny shelter out there that keeps them
65:15 out of harm's way for the most part but
65:18 you come back and your resources are
65:19 gone that's a little tiny analogy of
65:21 what it's like to have folks that are
65:24 untrackable how would you know who's
65:28 coming in your glog cabin you're gonna
65:30 have to go north two miles and then
65:32 backtrack around the side and pincer
65:34 maneuver this person to figure out who
65:35 the hell it is right and then what do
65:37 you do with them hmm well let's take you
65:41 back to the 1800s there's no law in
65:44 those areas in fact the Louisiana
65:46 Purchase hasn't occurred and so it's
65:51 basically law of the jungle right when
65:54 the Mormons headed west they left the
65:57 United States of America America to live
65:59 in this region that's now called Utah
66:00 well it was in America when they moved
66:03 out there it was eventually purchased
66:05 and called America all the settlers of
66:08 Deadwood if you watch that show on HBO
66:10 and study the history of it if you buy
66:12 the DVDs there's a lot of amazing
66:14 documentaries inside the DVDs you'll
66:16 know that they got there and it was
66:18 sovereign land it was the Native
66:20 American land it's where custard I think
66:22 but the dust but if you committed a
66:27 crime well the people got together and
66:28 decided what your punishment was well
66:32 imagine that taking a french fry was a
66:35 capital punishment they got to kill you
66:37 for stealing someone's stuff if you look
66:41 at a lot of the street justice that is
66:43 filmed in Asia South America Africa they
66:46 don't [ __ ] around man
66:47 you steal they cut your fingers off they
66:49 cut your entire hand off I've seen
66:51 unfortunately at least half a dozen
66:54 videos I think it's mainly in Africa
67:00 I've seen guys get their hands chopped
67:02 off it's it's intense
67:05 I mean imagine that you lose the
67:07 instrumentality of one of your hands
67:09 because you stole something well one
67:11 that's a pretty good deterrent from
67:13 stealing but
67:14 Jesus Christ that person was young and
67:16 stupid maybe they actually have a reason
67:19 to be stealing because they have no food
67:21 at all when you have no food you go
67:22 feral meaning your rationale for other
67:25 people's empathy goes away I've had
67:28 friends of mine in the course of their
67:30 life tell me stories about being
67:31 homeless and one of my friends ended up
67:35 being homeless in Los Angeles in the
67:37 last five years and nobody knew it
67:39 because they didn't want to really admit
67:41 it to anyone
67:42 they had no cellphone because their cell
67:44 phone program had you know expired they
67:46 had no money so they weren't able to
67:48 text anybody saying could you please you
67:50 know help me a couple bucks something
67:53 and one of my friends walked into a fast
67:58 food restaurant and they told me look I
68:01 just started screaming at them to give
68:03 me food because I was so starving I
68:05 couldn't think straight well here we are
68:07 you know spending six dollars on a
68:09 coffee and this person was looking for
68:11 three bucks to buy a Big Mac we are a
68:14 world of Plenty aren't we we just don't
68:17 distribute it well we allow corporations
68:20 to come in and cut down you know
68:23 rainforests destroying the oxygen
68:26 machine that keeps us alive and then we
68:28 want to talk about how the climate
68:29 changes hope really mm-hmm
68:33 out of all the things I've ever
68:34 mentioned on the show that we would have
68:37 to re-engineer or modifier analyze I
68:41 think the straw man person issue is
68:43 probably one of the most complex
68:46 gut-wrenching problems to solve and you
68:51 know that doesn't make me happy because
68:54 that's an issue I think it has to do I
68:58 think the solution would be something on
69:00 the order of we need something to
69:02 obviously identify everyone to figure
69:04 out what country you belong to what laws
69:06 you must obey because you're in a
69:09 particular country when you do cross
69:11 over a border just like maritime law
69:13 you're assuming the laws of that country
69:15 so if it's ok to do something United
69:18 States but not ok to do it in Mexico and
69:20 I cross that border I need to understand
69:22 what laws have increased on me so that I
69:25 don't violate those laws right sure as I
69:28 won't steal
69:28 anything anywhere I go outside United
69:31 States again I think the button on this
69:33 whole thing to fix this whole thing has
69:36 to do with education obviously we know
69:40 that education is sparse in the majority
69:44 of the world hell even the first rule
69:46 country of America we've got a horrible
69:50 educational system it used to be
69:53 unbelievable used to be the example to
69:55 the world of how to educate your people
69:59 and now it has been infiltrated you know
70:01 Charlotte is Ruby I'll always mention
70:03 her her book the deliberate dumbing down
70:05 of America was a bunch of agenda hatched
70:08 in Europe to destroy America and they
70:11 got their way and they're still getting
70:13 their way right big giant corporations
70:15 are moving into small towns and
70:17 destroying all the business and these
70:19 people in these small towns don't
70:20 realize it and they they're so happy
70:22 they get these corporations in they're
70:24 not realizing well soon as you get a
70:26 fast-food joint all the local
70:28 restaurants start losing customers once
70:31 you get a big giant department store
70:32 that's selling paper towels and toilet
70:34 paper cheaper than everybody else all
70:36 the little tiny department stores or
70:38 grocery stores got a business department
70:39 stores got a business shoe stores go out
70:41 of business clothing stores go out of
70:42 business but they're so happy the goal
70:46 on Facebook and like that cooperation
70:47 yay they've been taught to worship their
70:51 demise well once you do that you break
70:56 society at it's very core foundation and
70:59 once you break the foundation you create
71:03 people that are going to eventually
71:06 potentially end up committing crimes and
71:10 that's where the straw man has to swoop
71:12 in so we can track people committing
71:13 crimes against the rest of humanity if
71:16 we were to fix this problem then we
71:20 could probably lighten up a little bit
71:22 on how we how much surveillance has to
71:25 occur but we have entities that report
71:30 themselves to the society that we live
71:33 in as news organizations and they're no
71:36 longer news organizations they're
71:38 private for-profit organizations go see
71:40 my episode on profit news
71:42 and they inject in us the divide they
71:46 make us hate each other
71:47 they carry the deep state agenda
71:49 directly to the people they create
71:52 personalities but then are worshipped
71:54 because there's some identification that
71:57 we have with this person so I'm gonna
71:58 say they're gay and so they like the gay
72:01 person who reports the news they don't
72:04 and they don't listen to the message
72:06 they just have this identity with this
72:07 other person and there's straight people
72:10 to do the straight thing right this dude
72:11 looks like the kind of guy I like to
72:13 play pool with so whatever that guy says
72:15 I'm gonna I'm always on his side and as
72:18 long as that guy for 80% of what he
72:21 reports on the news is legit he can feed
72:24 you 20%
72:25 that's the divide it's a huge problem
72:28 that's why we have to make sure these
72:30 organizations go completely out of
72:32 business and I don't think there's one
72:33 that exists today that has any massive
72:36 popularity that we should keep they all
72:39 should go out of business
72:41 askew says we are the news as I said in
72:46 the profit profit news episode you know
72:49 we are now relying on essentially all of
72:52 us being journalists reporting back to
72:55 society through YouTube Twitter Facebook
72:58 what's actually going on in your local
73:00 territory now it used to be that you
73:03 could say well I live in a town or a
73:05 city and all I have to do is pay
73:06 attention to my town in my city all
73:09 right problem is the deep state is
73:11 trying to swoop in in that level
73:13 changing and destroying your town then
73:16 you might say well I live in this thing
73:17 called a state so I just got to protect
73:19 my state well we know that doesn't work
73:22 because states can be huge like
73:23 California where the northern half of
73:25 California believes a completely
73:26 different philosophy than Southern
73:28 California hmm do we just keep dividing
73:31 up States until we have little tiny
73:32 states and it's you know we have like
73:34 4,000 stars on the American flag because
73:36 we've divided it up so much that we're
73:38 kind of all alike in our little areas
73:40 sounds like a bad solution next up is
73:45 your country
73:45 all right we're building a wall on the
73:48 southern border of America because we
73:50 have drug cartels
73:52 trafficking people trafficking drugs
73:55 I'm bringing in a bunch of folks that
73:57 are undocumented so that we can't figure
73:59 out what we need to where we need to
74:01 allocate money to take care of things we
74:04 can't control our immigration at all
74:06 because okay well what is the legal way
74:09 to get into America
74:10 well you apply before you know you you
74:13 prove your case that you have talents
74:14 that we need and you go through a
74:16 10-year process to get your green card
74:18 roughly it's a little faster for other
74:21 countries well we can't operate like
74:23 that that's that's basically organized
74:25 chaos right but if you want to engage in
74:28 any level of this sort of checks and
74:32 balances then you're gonna have to
74:34 create some form of paper entity that is
74:38 you so we can track you you want the
74:41 spoils of a country even as a indigenous
74:44 born in the country citizen then they're
74:47 gonna have to figure out okay you know
74:49 Mary Smith lives in this particular
74:51 house and this particular community and
74:53 she has this much income she has this
74:56 much wasn't this this number of children
74:59 and she's gonna need some resources here
75:02 and therefore her insurance or whatever
75:03 how do you track it if you don't have
75:06 some methodology of tracking it so I
75:08 just wanted to open up the conversation
75:09 this is obviously just an introductory
75:11 course there is a tremendous amount of
75:13 legalese that goes with the person that
75:15 you should explore if this is something
75:17 that's interesting to you I would be
75:20 interested in any of your comments for a
75:22 solution if you know of a different
75:24 country that has a different methodology
75:25 than America or if your country operates
75:28 differently than what I've described
75:30 please mention that if it works really
75:31 well for you guys keep in mind how big
75:35 your country is there's some countries
75:36 that are smaller than you know Los
75:38 Angeles you know and so they can use
75:41 different solutions that wouldn't work
75:43 in a country with 350 million people
75:45 plus China is up to 1.4 billion how do
75:49 they manage their people it's a big-ass
75:52 country it's physically bigger than the
75:54 United States of America it's a
75:56 difficult difficult pill to swallow and
75:59 solve the problem at the same exact time
76:02 I think the one thing that we do
76:04 ourselves and injustice on is to run
76:06 around saying freedom liberty and
76:09 poverty these three words and we don't
76:12 have a definitive definition of what
76:16 those things mean I think it would be
76:18 interesting that if the law books and
76:20 every country simply have one page in it
76:22 right and you open it up and it says do
76:24 no harm and then every time you come
76:27 into a court of law there's a gradient
76:29 of how much harm you did to someone else
76:31 and then there's the punishment for that
76:33 gradient it's sort of how it works but
76:36 then we've split murder into a million
76:39 different categories because there are a
76:41 lot of different circumstances of which
76:43 that could occur you could be defending
76:45 yourself in your own house you could be
76:47 a starstruck lover who caught your
76:49 spouse sleeping with your best friend
76:51 and then you go crazy and you got a gun
76:53 and you shoot them both and now you're
76:54 gonna plead temporary insanity
76:57 then there's the premeditated murder
76:59 where someone's like I fell in love with
77:01 somebody else I'm gonna murder my spouse
77:03 so I can collect on their insurance
77:04 policy and go move off with my lover
77:06 instead of just getting a divorce
77:08 I think the the last statement I want to
77:12 make is that running a world of eight
77:14 billion people roughly is a job that
77:19 nobody wants people do have those jobs
77:23 they inherit the hundreds of years if
77:27 not thousands of years of built up law
77:30 to try and govern this but as the world
77:33 continues to populate those laws become
77:36 more and more difficult to enforce as
77:37 cultures differ around the world
77:39 you know we've got areas of the world
77:42 where you can kill your spouse and it's
77:43 okay you just say she committed adultery
77:45 and you can kill your spouse and there's
77:47 no crime going on there that's your
77:49 legal right it's insane you can force
77:53 your daughters to get circumcised what
77:57 it's going to take thousands of years to
77:59 pull this off we as the people have the
78:02 ability to get in and maybe modify
78:04 what's going on if we can find some
78:05 egregious problems but I think it's
78:09 going to be just like religion if you
78:11 all belong to the same religion you're
78:12 gonna interpret it differently because
78:15 it's complex and it's metaphorical and
78:17 it's going to be really really difficult
78:19 to get everybody in your congregation on
78:21 the same page
78:22 for every page in the Bible is just say
78:24 before everybody dies we don't like to
78:28 think of it being that complicated but
78:30 it is that complicated am i defending
78:33 the person well to an extent yeah
78:37 because I don't know how to do it any
78:38 other way do I think that all the
78:40 surveillance and ownership should still
78:42 be there hell no when I hear of a crime
78:45 that occurs and I think you know like we
78:48 had a plane disappear in a Malaysian
78:52 plane that disappeared everybody with
78:55 the right mind goes they know where that
78:57 plane went there's no place on planet
78:59 earth where a plane is flying especially
79:00 a commercial airline where there aren't
79:02 you know a dozen satellites that know
79:04 where that thing is I mean if there's a
79:07 blind spot in the world I don't think
79:09 any military would allow it to exist
79:11 because that would be an invasion point
79:13 for everybody in that region you could
79:15 launch a whole Armada of planes in this
79:18 blind spot and it could come right at
79:20 America right and all of a sudden
79:21 there's 50 blips and they're all
79:23 distributed so it's really difficult to
79:24 knock them out of the sky I don't think
79:26 those places exist so I think those
79:28 those crimes are bigger than we
79:31 typically allow it to be I say that
79:36 allow it to be in our minds right we
79:37 don't want to believe that the world
79:38 could have a whole airline that
79:40 disappears that happened and we forgot
79:44 about it hmm
79:46 jeez don't leave your first world
79:48 country because you could end up on
79:50 these planes and you could vanish it's
79:52 horrible right anyway let me know what
79:56 you think in the comments this is a
79:57 tough one if you haven't into deep
79:59 thoughts radio.com please go that's
80:02 where you can switch feeds from audio to
80:03 video there's a locked Facebook group
80:05 which is awesome there's a patreon page
80:07 in case you want to donate to the the
80:09 movement just pays for my cigars and
80:12 other things helps me pay for 4k cameras
