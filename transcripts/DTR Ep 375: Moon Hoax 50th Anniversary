00:00 [Music]
00:34 good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and
00:36 welcome back to deep thoughts today's
00:39 kind of sunny but it's kind of chilly
00:40 too so I bundled up just in case
00:43 something whips in there and gets kind
00:46 of cold that's your weather update for
00:51 Southern California April 30th 28 2019
00:57 gap still not even used the same 2019 so
01:00 2019 it is going to be the 50th
01:05 anniversary of a bunch of [ __ ]
01:09 in all fairness 1969 was a great year I
01:13 mean an amazing year I was born so but
01:19 just before that the month before that
01:21 they engaged in an ultimate lie on July
01:26 19th the lie became legendary the actual
01:32 real launching of the Saturn 5 which
01:36 kicked off a narrative that one side of
01:38 mind out of sight and it became out of
01:41 mind in terms of the evidence of what
01:44 was going on they were able to tell you
01:47 slash us for decades anything they
01:52 wanted to anything they wanted to so
01:57 this year is gonna be a bit of a push
01:59 they've been doing it sort of in spurts
02:02 it seems because the internet is surging
02:04 where one week I see a million Apollo 11
02:10 commemorative things you know everyone
02:12 get excited get excited it's the 50th
02:14 and then the kind of sub you know
02:18 subdues a little bit and I'm still
02:20 waiting for the next push it seems like
02:21 they've kind of relaxed a little bit
02:23 I mean if I was the PR firm I wouldn't
02:25 do anything major at all I mean but
02:28 they're but they're working for NASA if
02:30 I was NASA I would recommend holding off
02:35 until perhaps two weeks before the event
02:37 if you're going to throw a big fest
02:40 we'll advertise it locally don't worry
02:42 about it in a global level because again
02:45 the world no longer believes this crap
02:48 as I think as a whole I think you know
02:52 anyone who hates America
02:55 they don't believe it just because they
02:57 hate us because they know that there's
03:00 lies being told I mean just think about
03:03 living in America and knowing that we
03:07 went to war somewhere in the world and
03:10 then the only way that we know what's
03:13 going on in the war is that fake news
03:15 reports on it
03:17 right I mean I just mentioned this but
03:21 it's funny because I just kind of
03:22 leapfrog something from one episode to
03:24 another but you've got CNN who got
03:28 caught you know on top of a building I
03:30 believe in Los Angeles or Atlantic City
03:32 or wherever their headquarters might be
03:34 I think it was LA though but they put
03:36 these palm trees up there and they
03:37 pretended they were in Baghdad during
03:41 the Desert Storm invasion way back in 91
03:44 I think that's when that happened okay
03:48 and so imagine being in Baghdad and do
03:54 you know that they're not there and so
03:55 you see Americans come in and
03:57 rationalize destroying your country and
04:00 then you watch the news and it's
04:03 absolute Hollywood and you're like oh my
04:06 god these people built a set and said
04:09 they were in our city and if you just
04:11 look at the set you know in their minds
04:13 it looks silly and stupid in wrong and
04:16 so the rest of the world has this
04:19 education that America uses fake news to
04:22 advance all of its narratives if someone
04:25 from outside the United States continues
04:27 to watch it and watch it watch it and
04:29 listen to all the words being spoken
04:30 they could deduce just instinctively
04:33 that the military-industrial complex is
04:36 feeding in previous you know
04:38 incarnations the press okay I mean it's
04:42 still happening trust me it's still
04:44 happening see if I could survive without
04:46 this extra Jack here
04:48 so imagine that the rest of the world is
04:51 looking at us and thinking that oh my
04:53 god these people are not only stupid
04:55 because they believe this fake news
04:57 stuff but the government itself is
04:59 devious and maybe even have someone who
05:02 has sympathy for the citizens being so
05:05 stupid I don't know how you do it but I
05:06 guess someone could right and so then
05:10 here comes this moon thing that's gonna
05:11 be coming up the 50th moon anniversary
05:14 and they're gonna try to you know
05:16 probably keep it fairly localized you
05:19 know and there'll be certain partners
05:20 overseas part of the five eyes fake news
05:23 that'll carry the story just as sort of
05:26 will give them we're gonna do the
05:28 American fake moon landing thing as if
05:30 it was really yeah yeah you know but you
05:32 know what they're gonna carry our crap
05:33 too okay all right well we'll talk about
05:37 our cosmonauts they'll talk about
05:39 whatever so it's coming and as soon as
05:43 it's gone you know July 19th is the date
05:46 July 20th you won't hear a thing about
05:50 this it'll be as gone as quick as it
05:52 comes because they don't like the
05:54 pressure of the analysis of what they
05:58 did we may even see a clamp down on
06:02 information getting gagged as we get
06:06 closer to the 19th either temporarily or
06:08 permanently you know this is there was
06:11 this huge threat that YouTube was going
06:14 to remove or banned channels with
06:18 conspiracy content now that would remove
06:22 probably 30 to 40% of all the content on
06:27 YouTube so it'd be very difficult for
06:29 them to do that and still maintain any
06:32 relationship with the Internet as a
06:34 whole not that they give a [ __ ] because
06:36 their costs would go down as well but
06:39 there's only so many like cute puppy dog
06:42 videos and you know otters playing
06:44 around with rocks videos that we can
06:46 watch
06:47 eventually we need some substance in
06:49 there
06:50 I think the cue movement alone would
06:52 probably come up with something pretty
06:53 interesting but what's fascinating to me
06:57 right now and this is sort of a McCobb
07:00 fascination
07:01 is that there might be people who are
07:04 alive today who will be murdered by the
07:07 19th simply because they have the right
07:11 voice they've got the right audience
07:13 they're making changes when they speak
07:15 maybe they're an astronaut maybe there's
07:17 some sort of engineer some
07:20 administrative person who knows
07:22 something has the piece of evidence
07:25 would be a credible witness if they came
07:28 out and said you know what guys this
07:29 whole thing's fake and heads of state
07:33 keeping alive the 22 billion
07:36 dollar-a-year facade known as NASA will
07:40 most definitely spend whatever money
07:42 they need to go harder the vaccine
07:43 Pharma killers right the people that
07:46 kill doctors and pediatricians against
07:49 vaccinations whatever gang that is and
07:51 they'll chase you down and kill you
07:54 so it's sort of like when you look at a
07:56 hurricane and you see a gigantic you
08:00 know cat 3 or 4 with definite you know
08:06 obligatory cat 5 coming and you sit
08:09 there and you look at it going to me
08:10 coming towards the coast and no matter
08:13 what happens you're thinking to yourself
08:15 jeez there are people alive right now
08:18 that in 24 to 48 hours as soon as this
08:21 thing hits the coast
08:23 someone's gonna punch out they're not
08:26 going to heed the warnings they're just
08:29 gonna simply be in the wrong place at
08:31 the wrong time and due to the hurricane
08:34 not any other circumstance but do the
08:36 hurricane they'll be dead and that's a
08:39 sad thing that happens right well part
08:44 of me believes that July 19th as related
08:46 to the Apollo 11 anniversary is going to
08:49 create that situation now for those
08:52 hardcore listeners you know that I have
08:54 a habit of watching and marathoning
08:56 classic shows on television from the
08:59 past to harvest their DNA you know why
09:05 were they why was mash so catchy and
09:08 then looking at the culture and the
09:11 population at the time well we know
09:12 where we at war died uh in case of mash
09:15 we were
09:15 Vietnam War so it was sort of a way for
09:18 everyone to kind of see something but it
09:19 was Korean war back in the 50s with some
09:21 overlaid on top of the Vietnam War and
09:24 it was brilliantly cast written and
09:26 always stuff and then there was cheers
09:27 Cheers was that great you know show that
09:31 was on top of a yuppie era of the 80s
09:33 it's unfortunately responsible for a lot
09:37 of demoralization of society where you
09:40 know you take a guy Sam Malone this
09:42 character who's sleeping with tons of
09:44 women and edited out anyone who wants a
09:47 relationship is played off as frigid and
09:49 and stupid great then he have Fraser
09:54 which is much more innocent much more
09:56 beautiful and they just play up the
09:58 neuroses of these characters just giving
10:01 you a little bit of the reason why I go
10:02 into these things but I've been watching
10:04 Arrested Development for a second time
10:06 turns out I never finished season four I
10:08 don't know how they released the
10:10 episodes but they didn't have them all
10:12 up there when I thought I was finished
10:13 with it but Ron Howard is a big part of
10:18 this I think he maybe even directs it I
10:20 guess but he narrates it and he
10:24 eventually becomes an actor in it in
10:25 season four which is really cool I'm not
10:30 a big fan of all his work
10:32 I thought solo was awful the biggest
10:35 problem with solo is that the actor who
10:38 plays on solo smiles throughout the
10:41 entire movie and as a director I can't
10:43 even understand how Ron Howard didn't go
10:46 hey guy stop [ __ ] smiling you know
10:49 Han Solo doesn't smile except to tell a
10:54 lie or to get in the girl's pants right
10:56 so if you're not doing those two things
10:58 then you're not smiling but the actors
11:01 like I'm playing on so and he's so happy
11:03 and this is just rookie rookie actor
11:05 move rookie director move but Ron Howard
11:07 is not a rookie so I don't understand
11:09 how that was possible anyhow in wrested
11:15 development because he directed Apollo
11:17 13 he's part of the the Klan to keep the
11:20 hoax alive right they have part of the
11:27 Skid it was where Jason Bateman's
11:30 character Michael gets an opportunity to
11:34 meet Ron Howard playing himself and his
11:37 I don't even know if that company's real
11:39 I think it's a fake company that they
11:42 put in the show I don't know what his
11:43 real company's name is but it's this
11:45 building town in LA he's got this you
11:47 know movie production place and he
11:53 eventually meets with Michael who he
11:56 wants to get the Bluth family story
11:58 which is the fake family in that series
12:00 series is really funny by the way
12:03 yeah season four is a little exhaustive
12:05 because they get too many narratives
12:06 going in too many directions the
12:08 characters are all off on their own
12:09 universe and it's a little it's a little
12:11 exhausting for the mind to track all
12:13 that all of it it's like you're not
12:15 gonna have a problem you're not gonna
12:17 have a problem tracking the narratives
12:18 but you're just exhausted going up and
12:20 we're over here oh now we're over here
12:22 so tonight I'm gonna smoke a cube with
12:25 my buddy we're gonna get to season five
12:27 so that'll be all new territory but he
12:30 brings him into his office and he has
12:32 this Apollo lunar lander the limb
12:35 replica in his office and he's like you
12:38 want to go on the limb too you know
12:40 talking oh yeah sure and so there was a
12:46 couple interesting things that happened
12:48 that they did one the lamb inside looks
12:51 much larger than anything that went to
12:54 the moon so because they're able to fit
12:56 two guys really comfortably in this in
12:58 this thing looks like some of the
13:01 control panels I don't know they don't
13:05 look real they look very Hollywood which
13:07 is funny I mean the whole thing is
13:08 hilarious it's a comedy but he he
13:11 asserts in this show that they didn't
13:16 have the technology to land in 1969 so
13:18 the whole thing was a fake but later on
13:21 they did land on the moon but I've heard
13:24 this line of [ __ ] several times the
13:29 the big hole in that kubler-ross
13:32 [ __ ] attempt to get out of the fact
13:34 that it was all fake from 69 to 72 is
13:37 that nothing changed there were no
13:41 major epiphanies from 1969 to 1972 the
13:45 f1 boosters remain the same everything
13:48 was the same rote memory there's no
13:50 battery innovations right I mean
13:52 everything that makes this whole thing a
13:54 bunch of crap stayed exactly the same
13:57 for three years they baked it into
14:01 Arrested Development so that's how
14:05 clever they are with the campaign to
14:08 keep you thinking that it's true to just
14:10 drop it in drop it in and drop it in it
14:13 could be that a particular show simply
14:15 mentioned several times how we went to
14:17 the moon well you know we go to the moon
14:20 then they can also get into a lot of the
14:22 quote unquote science religion shows
14:25 like Cosmo and a bunch of other stuff
14:27 which pump all that other crap I won't
14:29 even repeat it and they'll do he was
14:32 something on the Apollo missions they
14:34 tapped into Nvidia video card company
14:36 and had them do a complete
14:39 reconstruction of one of the biggest
14:43 smoking guns that we didn't go which is
14:46 Buzz Aldrin coming down a ladder that
14:49 photo and so Nvidia shows this image and
14:54 it was really pathetic cuz they're
14:55 showing you this image and immediately
14:56 you look at it you're like let's see gee
14:58 that's not real and so then this guy
15:01 from Nvidia is like did you know this
15:05 isn't a real photograph this is you know
15:07 rendered in art you know more like yeah
15:09 we [ __ ] realized it was not real it
15:12 looks like a cartoon and you've also
15:15 erased everything in the in your image
15:17 that is the smoking gun and the real
15:19 photograph where there was all kinds of
15:22 lights on Buzz so light is a light is
15:25 not being cast on Buzz's he's backing
15:27 down the staircase and supposedly Neil
15:29 Armstrong is filming him and because
15:32 there are so many lights on this set you
15:35 have hot spots all over Buzz's outfit
15:38 you have it on the heels of his plastic
15:40 booties that he puts over his shoes you
15:43 have even hot spots on his clothing you
15:47 can take it into Photoshop and adjust
15:49 the contrast and all of a sudden you
15:50 start to see the concentration of light
15:53 in spherical distributions which is
15:55 coming from a lightbulb there's just
15:58 these kids who are CG experts man it's
16:00 crazy but so the guy from Nvidia is
16:03 rotating this graphic just telling you
16:08 like a brainwashing exercise what you're
16:11 seeing what you're seeing what you're
16:13 seeing and it's it was funny because it
16:18 was coming from a tone of voice that was
16:20 very defensive yet not completely
16:24 convinced or not completely convincing
16:27 excuse me as if the guy was a shitty
16:30 liar and he had been told okay we need
16:31 you to do this because it was fake and
16:33 this is probably one of the worst
16:36 smoking guns which is not but it's this
16:38 is this photographs a big problem for us
16:40 that we need you to dispel this with
16:42 your Nvidia card technology bla bla bla
16:45 and you know the only people that can
16:48 really lie to you and convince you that
16:52 they're lying to you or people that are
16:54 slightly smarter than you are on average
16:57 and we hate to accept that because we're
17:02 thinking any one of your lies is pretty
17:04 stupid
17:04 it's like know there are stupid people
17:06 who lie I mean and you immediately sense
17:09 it but then there are people that lie
17:12 and they're good at it
17:14 they're politicians they're CEOs they're
17:17 whatever
17:19 some scumbag salesmen that comes to your
17:21 door there's like mr. Sun showed up for
17:24 work today
17:25 holy cow yeah where's Elder this is
17:28 great so what do we do during this 50th
17:33 anniversary some of us might consider
17:37 ourselves you know super activists
17:39 against the moon landings
17:41 I really doubt there's that many people
17:42 out there I do not view myself that at
17:44 all I find it a fascinating thread in
17:48 the sweater and honestly I find it a lot
17:53 easier to talk about when it comes to
17:58 major conspiracies because again I don't
18:00 see it as I mean again Gus Grissom and
18:03 the other two guys they were murdered as
18:07 a result of this conspiracy
18:08 there's no way to overlook that and
18:10 that's a serious thing we have to think
18:12 think about and we have to assume that
18:15 potentially other people were murdered
18:17 because they found out about things
18:18 because back in the 60s when these
18:21 gangsters came into power they were
18:23 killing everybody that killed a
18:24 president a president's brother to black
18:28 leaders and then started injuring
18:31 anybody who was in Nixon's way and
18:34 that's what we know about we know that
18:36 LBJ killed everyone whoever found out he
18:39 had a mistress so they were just gun
18:42 slinging [ __ ] back in those days and
18:45 we can't assume that they're a lot
18:46 different today I don't think the amount
18:49 of deaths related to this kind of thing
18:53 is is as political as it used to be Seth
18:56 Rich was murdered we know because he
18:58 leaked DNC emails to WikiLeaks we know
19:02 judge Scalia was murdered because Bill
19:05 Clinton told Loretta Lynch I'm gonna
19:07 make a route make room for you you're
19:10 black you're female you're smart we'll
19:12 get you in there and of course that was
19:14 short-circuited but Scalia was murdered
19:16 and cremated before his family had any
19:18 chance to say hey he didn't want to be
19:21 cremated so there's still a little bit
19:24 of those shenanigans going on we haven't
19:28 heard to my knowledge any of the
19:32 youtubers being murdered right Alex
19:35 Jones is still kicking Roger stone still
19:37 kicking
19:38 mark dice is still fun I mean jeez if
19:41 anyone's gonna kill anybody even those
19:43 [ __ ] mark is like amazingly up their
19:47 butts every single day I mean so we'll
19:52 see you know I think I'll exchange the
19:55 shows it lost its value not every single
20:02 person's on his show the McKnight guy is
20:05 pretty cool and some other folks are
20:09 really cool but I mean Alex himself is
20:11 he's done he's absolutely done I don't
20:14 see that guy ever getting up to any
20:16 level of popularity again his crazy
20:19 [ __ ] persona it's just it's over man
20:22 like you can see past it now it's almost
20:24 like when you know Robin Williams god
20:27 bless him had a stick on stage where he
20:31 would go absolutely berserk on stage
20:33 he's high on cocaine and it was amazing
20:36 but eventually we got Jim Carrey we got
20:40 a bunch of other folks very similar to
20:41 him and they they didn't copy him
20:43 necessarily but they had their own
20:44 shtick and so we kind of matured out of
20:48 Robin Williams thing and one of the
20:50 reasons why he was fairly depressed
20:52 towards us his death was that he
20:55 couldn't he couldn't engage an audience
20:57 like he used to
20:59 diehard fans always went and always
21:01 loved him but he didn't have that
21:04 ubiquitous I can make the world laugh at
21:06 the drop of a dime thing won some of his
21:11 comic comedy was just intellectually
21:13 over most people's heads sometimes so
21:16 this moon mission thing we have two
21:18 strategies we can do with the 50th
21:21 anniversary we can turn the screws on
21:24 them really really hard which is sort of
21:28 like going up to a bully and egging him
21:31 on they're more powerful than us they
21:35 got more money they have intelligence
21:39 agencies that work for them that are
21:41 notorious for breaking the law and
21:43 committing capital crimes like murder
21:48 John Podesta called somebody to get
21:50 South Ridge murdered Bill Clinton called
21:53 somebody to get judge Scalia murdered
21:57 and that's amazing right I mean none of
21:59 us have a black book of people that will
22:02 go just kill someone on a dime but you
22:04 got to pay for it but then again we
22:07 don't belong to churches that have death
22:11 and sacrifice as our as our communion
22:15 with our D monistic Overlord now the
22:20 second option is that we go quiet let
22:23 them have their fun and then July 20th
22:27 we drop our bombs to basically take back
22:31 the narrative not fighting the giant PR
22:33 machine that they are
22:35 that's another option I think what we've
22:38 done on this show alone in terms of
22:41 combining the comments from listeners
22:43 and then creating more smoking-gun
22:45 episodes against the moon landings hoax
22:49 the evidence has been more powerful than
22:51 anything I've seen online I really
22:54 honestly think that the folks that have
22:57 come in again I just had more I'm having
23:01 for a weekly conversations with
23:03 individuals related to the battery
23:05 situation for the limb and for the
23:08 outfits with people I know here in
23:11 Huntington Beach people that are
23:13 transient smokers that come through the
23:15 the lounge I mean it's weird you know
23:18 have someone come through a lounge where
23:20 they're they're an engineering expert
23:22 that you've never heard of before and
23:25 they'll lay down you know they'll talk
23:27 about things and we'll let them know at
23:29 the lounge hey you know we're we're
23:31 conspiracy folks and you know they're
23:33 like okay
23:34 and so we bounced around the moon thing
23:36 and then based on someone identifying
23:39 themselves as an engineer of any kind we
23:42 just asked them to give us their opinion
23:44 about things and we'll say in 1969 did
23:48 you know of a battery that could operate
23:51 some sort of oxygen tank mechanism /
23:57 cooling unit I mean it starts to get
23:59 really ludicrous nowadays when you think
24:01 about it the amount of [ __ ] we bought
24:03 back in the day and and for decades is
24:06 mind-blowing but we talk to them about
24:08 batteries we talked to them about air
24:10 conditioning and heating systems and
24:11 they just start to cave but they start
24:14 to go oh my god how did I not see that
24:16 my whole life I recently at a
24:19 conversation with a friend of mine who
24:21 was talking about well what was in the
24:23 backpack
24:24 of the astronauts and I said well at a
24:29 minimum you've got two different
24:31 machines it would have to be in the
24:33 backpack one oxygen tank because there's
24:38 no there's nothing in space that you're
24:41 gonna be able to scrub like we have Navy
24:43 SEALs that go down in the ocean and the
24:45 scrubs the oxygen out of water
24:49 okay that makes complete sense it's
24:53 phenomenal
24:53 we have gills for our soldiers
24:57 so again Apollo 11 it's a fairly quick
25:00 mission Apollo 17 much much longer those
25:05 of you are scuba divers how long can you
25:08 dive on a tank and then imagine a tank
25:11 that is in a zero pressurized
25:15 environment okay don't know if that
25:19 matters but I think it might matter with
25:21 the way that things flow a lot of people
25:22 have been talking about how rubber seals
25:25 do not do not function in a vacuum makes
25:30 complete sense freezing a rubber seal
25:34 and then heating and rubber seal it's
25:36 gonna cause massive problems with the
25:38 seal and again if I have a seal that's
25:40 in my neck of the suit I'm wearing and
25:45 my back is to the shadow and my front is
25:48 to the Sun and there's no atmosphere in
25:49 this thing then that means this is 280
25:55 let's just say 200 let's give them 80
25:58 degree correction on that 200 degrees on
26:00 the front of my face and negative 200 on
26:02 the back of my neck that rubber seal is
26:05 gonna be all whacked out because it is
26:07 in two different climate zones all in
26:10 one shot but also in the backpack
26:14 outside of the system is providing
26:16 oxygen you have a system that is
26:20 claiming to be able to heat and cool a
26:24 single suit with two different
26:27 objectives keep the back warmer because
26:33 it's in the cold and your front colder
26:35 because it's in the Sun there's no
26:38 system on the planet that exists in 2019
26:41 that has even been remotely designed to
26:44 accomplish that task because here's the
26:46 problem let's say you walk out and
26:49 you've got a suit that does the front
26:51 colder and the back warmer and then you
26:54 start to rotate your body well now your
26:56 arm is the hot part you know my left
26:58 shoulder is really hot because it's in
26:59 the Sun right shoulder is all freezing
27:00 because it's in the shadow
27:02 how do you rotate the necessity of the
27:06 environmental system one of the
27:08 listeners reported in and said that the
27:10 first test that they ever did with those
27:11 suits was in the desert and they said
27:14 that it was a hundred and sixty degrees
27:16 in the desert and the astronauts started
27:18 passing out
27:20 well according to NASA that's a hundred
27:22 and twenty degrees cooler than what the
27:25 astronauts went through on the moon's
27:28 surface but now let's give them the
27:32 benefit of the doubt and say that
27:33 somehow the whole suits going up to 250
27:36 degrees Fahrenheit and then all you have
27:39 to do is cool it all the way down to
27:41 what seventy-two something like that I
27:43 don't remember any astronaut saying oh
27:46 my god it's really hot in this suit or
27:47 oh my god it's really cold in this suit
27:49 they never talked about it they weren't
27:51 supposed to talk about it the script was
27:54 either to marvel over the environment
27:55 which was barely mentioned okay and then
27:58 you have the objectives of the day is if
28:00 these guys are so business as usual the
28:03 being on the [ __ ] moon is not a big
28:05 deal well I'm so professional I'm a
28:07 professional pilot and I just keep keep
28:10 my eyes on the road my eyes on the road
28:12 okay after about a thousand hours of
28:14 flying it's just like driving a car when
28:16 you're 25 you really don't care anymore
28:18 it's not special like it was when you
28:20 were fifteen but being on the moon
28:24 really being on the moon I think that
28:29 would be it would be difficult for
28:32 Houston to keep these guys on track
28:33 because someone's gonna just flip out
28:35 someone's gonna be on that moon go I
28:37 know I saw this in training at the Sea
28:40 of Tranquility simulation where area 51
28:44 exists but this is really the moon I'm
28:49 really here I'm really staring at the
28:51 Earth from far far away and there is
28:54 nothing you can do to make me shut my
28:55 mouth this is phenomenal I think it was
28:59 Apollo 16 or 17 they burned out the
29:02 camera by pointing it at the Sun and
29:04 then played golf and saying you know
29:06 tiptoe through the tulips or whatever
29:09 they sang some unbelievable sure they're
29:14 on the moon
29:15 sure yeah cuz that's what you're gonna
29:17 do if you burned out the camera and blew
29:20 your mission for being recorded you
29:22 still stay on target you still pay
29:24 attention and you still have your mind
29:27 blown the entire time you're there
29:29 because no astronaut went back twice so
29:32 have the six times that they did land
29:34 supposedly on the moon twelve human
29:36 beings stepped on the moon and saw it
29:39 for the first time in human history then
29:44 you have six guys orbiting the moon
29:47 waiting for them to come back up none of
29:50 it really happened but that's the story
29:54 their reactions don't make any sense in
29:57 my opinion now you're hearing me talk
30:00 about a lot on the show how life
30:02 imitates art and we've touched on this
30:05 several times in moon episodes but we
30:08 need to at the at the 50th to think
30:11 about the thought process that people
30:13 who've bought into this conceal the hoax
30:17 thing which is essentially a human being
30:21 deciding to spite humanity it's a human
30:26 being deciding to really deviate from
30:29 the objectives of your creator as it's
30:33 laid down through even do no harm
30:35 common law and you choose for the
30:39 religious metaphor a demonic satanic
30:43 objective of lying to the people it's
30:48 lying to the entire world to let's make
30:50 sure we're very clear about this we're
30:54 in a global world now because of the
30:55 Internet so when NASA says something
30:57 happened that didn't happen like
30:59 pictures of fake black holes then
31:02 they're lying to the entire world
31:03 they're misguiding the entire world
31:05 they're misguiding the the youth of the
31:07 world and again what would be the
31:12 penalty of lying to a child now for the
31:16 sake of Santa Claus and Easter bunnies
31:19 and all that stuff we tend to overlook
31:23 that fabrication I have a whole episode
31:27 on Santa Claus way back and I think
31:29 season two fairly proud of that that
31:32 episode could be in the season three I
31:34 can't remember but when you misguide a
31:37 child on a scientific basis meaning that
31:39 their entire academic life will be
31:41 inverted in a satanic way gravity is a
31:46 pole not a push there is no ether when
31:51 everything is made of ether you know
31:52 there wasn't a big bang but it you know
31:55 that you're saying there was a big bay
31:57 you know so it pollutes our ability to
32:01 gain personal strength personal
32:04 enlightenment to get to the next level
32:06 how many science fiction movies are we
32:08 gonna watch where they they go on and on
32:10 us to say well if you know mankind can
32:14 survive its own aggression its own
32:16 nuclear holocaust thoughts or world war
32:19 thoughts and you're like you know we
32:21 could totally get past this in like a
32:23 decade if we could just kill every
32:25 single deep state [ __ ] out there
32:27 who keeps feeding this and every Bill
32:30 Nye the douche bag guy and neil degrasse
32:31 tyson people who run around towing these
32:35 fake agendas this fake science the CERN
32:40 Hadron Collider is 90% complete [ __ ]
32:43 looking for big bang attributes and
32:46 other crap it's like please guys I
32:50 didn't want big nerdy toys to play with
32:52 but lying to the people you're gonna get
32:55 caught you're gonna get caught and we're
32:59 dying to hear at your tribunal your
33:02 excuse for going along with the crowd
33:04 because now you have been warned now you
33:06 have been told that we know you're lying
33:08 if you're too stupid to know that you're
33:11 completely screwed up well then you
33:13 shouldn't have the position that you
33:14 have you're a steer at a college of
33:16 absolute morons patting each other on
33:19 the back but all you are is a physical
33:22 metaphor to the mind of man holding us
33:24 down with your stupidity but I think
33:27 that people who are involved in the hoax
33:30 and there's really just two types of
33:32 people who are involved with the hoax
33:34 people who are so incapable of thinking
33:37 for themselves that they can't get past
33:40 science where observable reality doesn't
33:42 match any of their theories and so they
33:44 just simply go along with it their tail
33:46 grabber and then you have your person
33:51 who is clever enough to find out it's a
33:53 hoax but their whole strategy is to say
33:55 well I'm involved with something covert
33:59 something clandestine and therefore I
34:02 must be important because these evil
34:04 people who have been doing these
34:06 clandestine secret projects against
34:08 humanity forever are choosing me I must
34:16 be special then maybe at your Kissinger
34:20 level you're I don't know somewhere up
34:24 there somebody goes well we have to
34:26 instigate art to get society to move
34:31 forward the problem with that theory is
34:36 that it's a lie and we know that they're
34:42 not really interested in society
34:44 imitating art and getting there because
34:46 no one is green-lighting any true
34:48 research to get to the moon we haven't
34:50 been there in 50 years I mean you know
34:52 what 48 years or whatever 47 years no
34:57 one's been there as a healin well Christ
35:01 if you could get there in 1969 with
35:03 ColecoVision you know Simon Says
35:08 technology then we should be able just
35:11 to be there for lunch
35:13 honestly hunter grin you should be able
35:16 to get to the moon and nothing flat
35:18 there should be a vehicle that flies us
35:20 to a spinning wheel and then from the
35:22 spinning wheel we take a smaller craft
35:24 to the moon
35:25 there should be bases there factories
35:28 there we should be living in the bowels
35:29 of the of the moon if there if there's
35:32 you know at least a couple miles worth
35:34 the surface there but we've never been
35:36 there so it's what's funny about this
35:40 whole thing is that when I tell people
35:41 that we didn't go to the moon didn't if
35:44 you've done it you've heard this as well
35:46 they'll say well I you know I had a
35:48 buddy who asked me recently you know do
35:51 you think we not didn't go to the moon I
35:53 said
35:53 we didn't go not happy about that but I
35:56 don't think we went and he said well you
35:59 know I'm with you on that I mean I'm
36:01 open to that but I just can't resolve
36:04 the fact that I think that there would
36:06 have to be thousands of people in on it
36:09 in order to keep the light going I will
36:16 tell you a couple things I mean I did a
36:18 whole episode on this one I don't
36:20 believe really but there was a ton of
36:22 people involved with the moon hoax back
36:25 in 69 to 72 as much as you might think
36:28 mutton almost everyone involved with the
36:32 moon landings quote-unquote we're
36:35 looking at instruments looking at
36:36 readings and the only thing that had to
36:38 be done to make sure that those people
36:41 believed that it was real was to fake
36:42 their readings keep that satellite up in
36:45 space nice and updated so that it
36:47 simulated the the moon hoax and I think
36:51 it's funny that arthur c clarke who
36:53 really put the the first inception 'el
36:56 idea about a geocentric orbit satellite
37:01 which you know i mean come on we give
37:05 away way too much credit when when
37:08 there's a situation where nothing has
37:10 ever been done in a particular industry
37:11 because it doesn't exist and then that
37:13 industry forms and then people come up
37:15 with this low hanging fruit [ __ ] and
37:17 you're like oh so-and-so invented this
37:18 and so thought well hey man a
37:20 five-year-old what I figured it out in a
37:21 few minutes if you just involve them
37:24 with the project right because there's
37:26 the low-hanging fruit stuff that happens
37:28 to get the industry going but anyway but
37:31 we come up with that which can then
37:34 perform a lot of very similar things but
37:37 the satellite that needs to simulate the
37:39 Apollo 11 just has to be over the you
37:43 know where the moon is so it has to go
37:45 fast enough so it stays when the moon is
37:47 so as the Earth rotates it's always
37:48 coming down from the moon that's all
37:50 they had to do it's not easy but they
37:53 did it what's more fascinating about the
37:57 thousands of people involved with the
37:59 moon hoax is that NASA and probably the
38:03 various intelligence agencies that
38:05 protect NASA and the
38:06 whole hoaxes of stealing 22 billion
38:09 dollars a year out of us and that's just
38:12 the Declassified amount of money right
38:14 is that we probably have more people
38:16 involved with the hoax today would do to
38:19 simply psychological conditioning of
38:22 these individuals to feel a sense of
38:23 purpose and importance and intelligence
38:25 as a result of being involved with the
38:28 moon missions slash now the new fake
38:31 Mars missions so you imagine imagine a
38:35 situation where you graduated in some
38:37 aerospace technology you're a smart
38:40 person for sure not intelligent but
38:43 you're smart you could repeat things
38:46 you've memorized
38:47 whoop-dee-doo but you feel great and
38:50 you're making 120 to 200 thousand
38:52 dollars a year maybe you're 25 years old
38:55 you can fly places and do things and
38:58 smoke hundred-dollar cigars do whatever
39:00 you want your family thinks you're
39:03 amazing right you report home that
39:05 you're in aerospace and they're so proud
39:08 of you you work a GPL you work at NASA
39:12 you work at SpaceX you mean to tell me
39:16 that if you brought these people aside
39:18 and said oh by the way this is all fake
39:20 we're not really going you mean to tell
39:22 me either someone is gonna throw away
39:24 all that alkyl aid in order to tell the
39:27 truth especially in a sociopathic nerd
39:30 who has been waiting their entire life
39:33 to be important because they're not what
39:35 they think is pretty no way no way man
39:41 they're gonna hang on to that status
39:44 bump forever
39:47 and if you try to threaten that status
39:49 bump they will go into cool the Ross and
39:51 they will never get out of anger ever or
39:55 they'll they'll get with a bunch of
39:57 their kind and laugh it off and go about
40:00 their business you know what if they
40:02 care where nobody did them so I think
40:06 there are literally thousands and
40:08 thousands of people who are involved
40:10 with sustaining the moon hoax but I
40:13 would say let's say there's 10,000
40:15 people I think that's probably pretty
40:16 high but it's probably around there
40:19 if there are a thousand 2,000 people
40:23 actively posting and sustaining the moon
40:25 hoax the individuals that are actually
40:29 feeding them their propaganda is
40:32 probably much less maybe 1% who would be
40:37 the individuals who know we don't go to
40:39 them we didn't go to the moon that we
40:40 don't go into space at the time that we
40:43 say we do well probably all the
40:46 astronauts probably the upper
40:50 administration of both NASA and JPL for
40:53 sure but then it would be the corrupt
40:56 intelligence agencies that work for the
40:58 five eyes and slash the big bankers the
41:01 people that own the corporations that
41:02 will make the money when they buy new
41:04 rocket engines or whatever now Rockets
41:10 go into space we see that all the time
41:12 again SpaceX is a retro landing boosters
41:17 is probably all still complete [ __ ]
41:19 there's never a crowd of human beings
41:22 watching those things land and the third
41:24 one that lands out in the ocean is
41:25 absolutely laughable ok for anyone
41:29 involved with SpaceX or what have you
41:31 you know that might think that oh you
41:33 know we get those boosters ship back to
41:35 SpaceX we're not building new ones so
41:37 where the hell are they coming from well
41:40 you could probably have those boosters
41:42 land with parachutes potentially get a
41:46 little bit bummed up so I would say if
41:49 they come back into SpaceX to be reused
41:52 then just look at the damage on them see
41:54 if they look like they landed softly and
41:57 again I never invite us the skeptics in
42:01 to see these boosters land what would it
42:03 take a thousand dollars maybe maybe even
42:06 less than maybe 500 bucks fly me from
42:08 California to Florida was I gonna run
42:11 360 for 100 bucks put me up for a night
42:14 at some motel I don't even need a hotel
42:18 so swanky motel let me Ober over to the
42:23 landing site let me bring this camera my
42:26 cell phone and maybe fly five of us out
42:30 there a couple grand I've got a couple
42:31 grand
42:32 to have a bunch of people finally see it
42:35 and dispel the fact that SpaceX is a
42:38 facade I mean they're launching those
42:40 those Falcon rockets and stuff I mean
42:42 those things do grow up people watch the
42:44 rocket go up they just don't see the
42:45 Boosters land if there's that you know
42:51 what is it the the platform that it
42:55 lands the third one lands in the ocean
42:56 alright we'll get me on a boat so I can
43:01 see it with my own eyes because I don't
43:04 think it's possible I think if you even
43:06 land that thing on the platform in the
43:08 middle of the ocean the ocean is
43:10 absolutely chaotic and nuts and SpaceX
43:13 will never ever be able to predict the
43:15 ocean wave you know tipping so even if
43:19 you landed on it it should fall over
43:20 because the thing's gonna go you know
43:22 it's gonna it's not gonna happen that is
43:26 where I believe the people are today
43:28 that are maintaining the lie and again
43:31 you just have a bunch of people who are
43:33 young and personable who are believing
43:35 this stuff because it gives them status
43:37 and money now I'm in an episode which I
43:41 think is extremely important it's called
43:42 NASA selling doom and right now in 2019
43:47 there is just countless articles coming
43:49 out saying how there's gonna be a
43:51 meteorite
43:52 you know shower hitting the earth and
43:55 it's gonna be horrendous they'll be big
43:56 meteorites that land which is a little
44:00 concerning because when the meteorite
44:02 went over Russia that exploded and bust
44:05 a bunch of windows and supposedly landed
44:07 in some ice-covered lake many miles away
44:11 from where you saw it in the sky the
44:13 what is it the Defense Minister of
44:15 Russia came out and said that is a CIA
44:18 weapon you know what I heard that I was
44:22 interesting is what a what an exotic
44:25 accusation why why accuse a foreign
44:29 country if it's just a meteorite isn't
44:33 that weird
44:34 I meat would be like us having a bunch
44:36 of tornadoes in the Midwest and it
44:38 happens to kill a thousand people in
44:39 Oklahoma City or something and suddenly
44:42 Trump just goes it was Putin and it was
44:44 a weather manipulation thing
44:47 really you're gonna start a world war
44:49 potentially over a storm that killed a
44:52 thousand people and this thing in Russia
44:54 I don't think killed anybody
44:56 busted a [ __ ] ton of windows all right
45:02 so maybe they know something we don't
45:04 know I mean we as the citizens of this
45:06 country if they have something like that
45:10 then there's a little bit of a concern
45:12 because how would they fake a strike
45:15 from space kinda in a way that you would
45:18 never be able to identify it even in the
45:21 video so let's say you're seeing a
45:24 meteorite come in and you're in San
45:27 Bernardino which is sort of up in the
45:29 hills overlooking LA and so you have
45:33 this perfect shot of this thing coming
45:34 in all it has to do is stay on fire
45:37 enough that you can't identify it before
45:41 it hits the ground or maybe right when
45:43 it hits the ground some warhead
45:45 detonates now the thing is is that a
45:49 warhead should not be nuclear in nature
45:53 because I don't think a meteorite would
45:56 ever create radiation signatures like a
45:58 bomb that's like a nuclear bomb does so
46:01 you need some super conventional thing
46:03 it's not going to blow up just because
46:05 the outer outer shell this thing is on
46:07 fire but the thing in Russia looked very
46:10 very convincing as a non missile thing
46:13 it looked gigantic there was a point
46:16 when it exploded in you know broke
46:18 windows so now let's take a step back
46:21 from the fiftieth anniversary and but
46:25 keep our eyes on it and think about this
46:28 some of you may actually have a history
46:31 within your family within a circle of
46:33 friends
46:34 well this exact thing has occurred a lot
46:39 of times religious cults actually create
46:41 this situation where you have a family
46:43 member that runs off with a religious
46:44 cult and I don't mean to attack any
46:46 religion necessarily but they run off
46:48 into some group it could be a business
46:51 cult and you tend to lose your family
46:55 member because again every cult tells
46:57 you to hate your family that's what they
46:59 do
47:00 so if you end up going in not hitting
47:03 your family now some people have family
47:05 problems they've had their whole life's
47:06 and so it's just because they maintain
47:08 that opinion after they go in doesn't
47:11 mean that that group had anything to do
47:12 with it but there are points where
47:13 people have perfectly good lives they
47:16 have a self-image issue they sell flow
47:19 there would have you and then the cult
47:21 says you know why you hate yourself you
47:23 hate yourself because your father's
47:24 horrible your mother's horrible bump up
47:26 up up ah and so then they pushed
47:28 everybody out and the cult gets a little
47:30 leader I mean gets a little person in
47:32 there work for them and potentially
47:33 raise money and volunteer all their life
47:36 to the cult now we haven't had a Jim
47:40 Jones thing or Hari Krishna thing in a
47:43 really long time where these sorts of
47:45 organizations infiltrate families and
47:48 really destroy them for at least a
47:52 little um I haven't had that in a while
47:54 and I'm talking about America obviously
47:56 because I have no knowledge of other
47:57 country so I apologize to my outside
47:59 listeners you fill in the blanks there
48:04 but now let's just say that we as a
48:07 group let's say that we're all on a
48:10 family all of us we're all related to
48:12 each other and a few of our members of
48:14 the family go off and do this one person
48:17 convinces a cousin and a niece and a
48:19 nephew and an uncle and now it's like
48:20 geez out of 20 of our family members
48:22 we've lost four to this cult and we have
48:28 to sit there and go oh [ __ ]
48:29 well let's acknowledge a couple things
48:32 the cult obviously has some stick some
48:35 spiel that they're giving these people
48:37 some pitch that they're giving these
48:39 people that must be really convincing
48:40 and so if we wanted to repair the
48:44 situation we know that the last thing we
48:46 can do is go in and abduct these people
48:48 and bring them home physically abduct
48:50 them and bring them home it's not going
48:52 to work we also know that if we were to
48:54 go in and say hey you're involved with
48:58 this horrible cult you know I watched
49:01 some videos on YouTube read some
49:03 articles about this cult and they've
49:05 they are notorious for doing this and
49:07 destroying families blah blah blah
49:10 that's not going to work either
49:13 so what the hell is our option will be a
49:17 case-by-case basis wouldn't it one
49:21 because cults typically keep you away
49:23 from your family members and the reason
49:27 why they do that is they don't want any
49:28 rational thought to reintroduce itself
49:31 into the person who's stuck in the cult
49:32 and so they'll tell you ahead of time
49:38 you know what's going to happen right
49:39 your family members well they don't
49:42 understand what you're doing they're
49:45 dumb they're ignorant maybe they're not
49:47 even done they kind of be careful with
49:50 the whole thing and they're like but
49:52 they don't understand the genius of what
49:55 we're doing and so you don't want to
49:58 talk to them yeah because they're gonna
50:00 potentially be really negative and acing
50:02 and if you do talk to them just wait
50:03 just wait they're gonna say something
50:05 horrible about us and if they know that
50:07 they've got some vulnerabilities they
50:09 may actually cite the vulnerabilities to
50:10 the person who's in the cult such that
50:14 they anticipate everything you know well
50:18 they're gonna say that we're crazy and
50:20 bah Papa Papa and so the here comes the
50:23 family member talking lucidly to them
50:24 and of course those that attempt to
50:26 dispel the value of the cult will be
50:29 immediately earmarked as these people
50:31 that are negative get rid of them
50:34 and you double down on getting rid of
50:35 anyone around you that is against your
50:38 new belief system I'm talking about them
50:40 of course all right the only way you can
50:45 really pull this off if you have a
50:46 chance in hell it's to stay close to
50:50 them in any way you possibly can really
50:54 close to them support them in their
50:56 decision to join the cult as much as it
50:59 might boil your blood or make you want
51:01 to puke because imagine what a reverse
51:06 psychology technique that might be the
51:09 cults telling them to hate their family
51:10 members because their family members are
51:12 one responsible for all of their
51:14 confusion demise and anger but to that
51:17 they're going to come back and say bad
51:18 things about the cult well what if you
51:22 come back and you say good things about
51:24 the cult
51:26 well I'm glad you found something you
51:27 really believe in that's super cool and
51:29 he wants you to tell me about what your
51:31 cold beliefs and maybe I'll join you
51:33 just play them but now isn't that a
51:36 tough thing to do and then how do you
51:40 peel them away so you don't lose them
51:42 you stay close to them you watch them
51:45 evolve through this and usually you know
51:48 again a cult has some very positive
51:51 truthful things that they will bring in
51:53 there until you know someone says I
51:56 should sleep with your kids and then
51:57 you're like oh okay can't think for
52:01 myself right now the other thing is that
52:06 they create these very touchy subjects
52:09 such that if you touch it you
52:12 immediately deemed a combatant and so
52:17 the problem is is let's say we do that
52:18 little technique with someone who's
52:20 stuck in aerospace and they're again
52:22 getting all the accolades they ever
52:23 wanted in life all the status and ego
52:26 from being involved with the fake space
52:28 program and you come in you go oh you
52:32 know you're still friends with them you
52:33 played that game well and maybe you come
52:37 in you go well you know what I I'm like
52:40 you you know I'm really I'm really
52:44 astonished that people believe we didn't
52:46 go to the moon and so I'm wondering if
52:50 maybe you'd help me debunk their things
52:55 maybe we could just be my expert and
52:57 they're like oh my god I get to be an
52:59 expert holy [ __ ] you bet man because I'm
53:02 all about status and ego it's my only
53:05 way of getting value in this life and so
53:08 you throw things out them slowly and
53:11 maybe even throw one that's like the the
53:13 Sirach right when you see the antenna
53:16 shadow going up on the seat rock you
53:18 suddenly realize that little fold in the
53:20 rock is not a fold at all it's actually
53:22 it's actually an antenna shadow on there
53:25 so you both laugh and you're like ha ha
53:28 see how stupid those people are they
53:29 think we didn't go the moon because of
53:30 this rock and it's just a shadow and
53:31 they're so dumb they can't even see it
53:33 well I fell for it until I saw the
53:35 larger picture so you gain some
53:38 credibility with them
53:39 then you throw them the moon buggy which
53:44 has a dummy in it you throw them things
53:47 like well what battery system would they
53:49 have used you know what kind of battery
53:52 system do they use inside the spacesuits
53:53 because hey a Tesla can't get more than
53:56 280 miles maybe 300 miles and it's the
54:00 latest and greatest battery system on
54:01 planet Earth so I'm just trying to I'm
54:04 trying to nail these guys who say that
54:06 the stuffs fake what air conditioning
54:08 system did they use inside the suits
54:09 such that you know in the Front's 280 in
54:11 the backs negative 280 how did they get
54:13 balanced out you know I'm just trying to
54:15 get rid of these guys over here I'm on
54:17 your side one by one they get things
54:20 they can't solve and even if they can't
54:25 solve it you don't say oh well maybe
54:27 they're telling the truth maybe we
54:28 didn't go you never say that
54:29 let them say that first because even if
54:32 they go into a kubler-ross denial phase
54:35 and they go well I don't know how that
54:37 worked but obviously it worked in the
54:40 back of their mind they'll chew that up
54:43 while they're going to bed at night
54:44 they'll chew it up when they're in the
54:45 shower and eventually the virus of truth
54:47 will start to building them a seed of
54:49 truth now we only have 4000 subscribers
54:52 to this show so if we had a million
54:57 subscribers to the show I could say the
54:58 words one of you knows someone in
55:01 aerospace that believes we went to the
55:04 moon and they still get their paycheck
55:05 from that that artery every day I can't
55:10 say that right now I don't think anyone
55:12 watching this show is married to or
55:14 dating anyone in aerospace I just don't
55:16 think that's don't have enough people to
55:18 claim that maybe you know someone you
55:21 can use this technique towards them but
55:24 right now we don't have enough people so
55:26 we're just a silent majority talking to
55:29 each other majority of 4,000 the wait is
55:34 weird how we have 4,000 subscribers but
55:37 a show might only get watched 500 times
55:39 it's really strange that's a pretty low
55:41 percentage of the entire bunch you know
55:44 I'm debating about how much pressure to
55:47 put on before the 19th quite frankly
55:49 I've got a friend of mine who wants to
55:51 put down a huge bomb
55:52 before the 19th but she might have
55:55 changed her mind I don't know it just
55:58 depends on how much pressure a person
56:00 wants to put on themselves but I think
56:02 right after it might be interesting now
56:06 we know that YouTube has actively D you
56:12 know D circulated all the conspiracy
56:14 videos and I'll give you an example
56:16 episode 165 which is my most popular
56:19 moon hoax video although some are
56:23 getting you know still doing fairly well
56:26 it's a 28,000 views it's almost a 29,000
56:31 views that's quite a bit for this
56:34 channel for sure this is my most watched
56:35 video but here's the thing it hit twenty
56:39 eight thousand six months ago when
56:42 somebody did something in the video
56:43 wasn't circulation somebody posted it
56:46 somewhere now maybe that organic link to
56:49 the video has run its course it's now
56:52 buried in some pagination on a page so
56:55 it's really far away but it coincided
57:00 with the announcement that YouTube was
57:02 going to get rid of conspiracy videos
57:04 and essentially what it is is it would
57:07 never put it in your recommended feed it
57:10 would never put it in your home feed now
57:13 I've got two or three channels in
57:16 YouTube and I will change channels you
57:22 know which has a different user name and
57:24 all that stuff because they force it on
57:25 you right I would never do that if I
57:26 didn't have to both soon as I changed my
57:29 own channel that I'm in a different
57:30 account right different user account now
57:34 if I go into YouTube and I search on an
57:36 exact title of my video I immediately
57:38 find it if I go into Google I
57:39 immediately find it if I know DTR EP and
57:42 then say 44 I'll see my old while video
57:46 show up what I never see in my home feed
57:51 nowadays I could watch a hundred moon
57:54 videos your home feed is supposed to be
57:57 an algorithm that shows you more videos
58:00 like the ones that you've seen I never
58:02 seen my own stuff and what's funny is
58:05 I've got accounts where I've liked a few
58:08 my own videos and they never show up so
58:13 there they are censoring us and gagging
58:15 us right because we know that the news
58:18 is completely fake and I mean fake on a
58:21 level that's ridiculous right we know
58:24 that they don't care about the truth
58:26 they're not trying to censor lies away
58:30 from people they're trying to censor
58:32 fakeness to the people so we don't have
58:36 to search any further to know what the
58:38 game is the game is lies lies lies lies
58:41 lies as the 17 guy says the letter 17
58:48 dude you don't get the flack unless
58:51 you're over the target all right again
58:55 all the videos that we post that have a
58:57 Britannica link below them or a
59:00 Wikipedia link below them are definitely
59:03 truth videos that have been giving the
59:06 lie underneath them that's what that's
59:08 for let me give you propaganda while
59:10 you're looking at the truth but does
59:12 that mean everything that's in these
59:13 videos are all true no we're trying our
59:15 best man we're trying our best to figure
59:17 out what part of what we've seen is
59:19 completely fake and exactly how it was
59:21 faked etc etc right we're not trying to
59:25 be jerks and I'm going to tell you a
59:27 little story I heard and perhaps you
59:30 guys have the links to this and the
59:33 person's name because I heard it I
59:36 watched a video 10-15 years ago not even
59:41 15 years ago on YouTube when it was
59:43 first birthing this is when Google had
59:46 their video channel that could not
59:48 possibly take off and it was simply
59:50 because the engineers did a horrible job
59:52 laying the whole thing out they had the
59:54 backbone perfectly in place and why I
59:57 mean they bought youtubes they don't
59:58 need to do anything else but the reason
60:02 why Google bought YouTube is to control
60:04 the truth to control the narrative
60:07 that's why it was purchased by them but
60:10 there was a story that I guess you could
60:15 call it leaked I don't know where an HBO
60:19 female HBO documentary filmmaker was
60:24 approached by a secret division of the
60:27 military and she said that they invited
60:32 her to a meeting in a mobile home or
60:37 some mobile unit it was just on the side
60:41 of a highway I think as she described it
60:43 but she was invited in and she was shown
60:48 a notebook and the notebook was full of
60:53 pictures of aliens and I can't remember
60:58 if she said it was gray aliens or
61:02 whatever I don't remember but she said
61:06 that we she was shown like this giant
61:08 notebook of all these photographs of
61:09 saucers and aliens and da da da da and
61:12 they told her we we have looked at your
61:15 work we like the way you do what you do
61:17 and we want you to crack this story
61:20 you're gonna break it to the world these
61:25 are some of the pieces of evidence that
61:26 we have available to you to make your
61:29 documentary what do you think
61:31 and the story goes is that she went back
61:36 to HBO and it was like oh my god this is
61:39 gonna be amazing far as I understand it
61:41 she was in Los Angeles and she brought
61:46 it to her people
61:47 they're totally excited so she agrees to
61:50 do it cause back her contact and I it
61:56 would assume that she was invited back
61:58 for a second meeting because she went
62:00 back to this location to have the second
62:02 meeting and somewhere between the last
62:04 phone call she had with these
62:05 individuals and trying to go to that
62:07 location again they decided against it
62:09 and they she said it was just like one
62:12 of those movies where she goes back to
62:13 the location and the trailer is gone and
62:15 no one's answering her phone calls
62:17 anymore don't know if it's technically
62:20 true but that isn't that interesting now
62:24 it could have been a bunch of crap could
62:26 have been them feeding her a bunch of
62:27 fake stuff just to see if she would buy
62:29 it
62:31 could be it's a big tall tale that
62:33 someone invented and because we can't
62:35 find individuals we can't verify
62:37 anything who knows but that story's
62:40 always stuck with me because it's just
62:42 unique at some points we need someone
62:50 like the 17 guy to come out and reveal
62:54 these type of hoax hoaxes I guess now he
63:00 was asked the 17 guy was asked if we
63:02 went to the moon and he said yes but he
63:07 said the same thing that Ron Howard said
63:09 in Arrested Development
63:11 for the most part didn't go in 69 but we
63:14 went later with a secret space program
63:18 alright now we know that presidents are
63:21 not allowed to land in area 51 so matter
63:25 how much security clearance you might
63:27 have you could have Q clearance and you
63:32 wouldn't go wouldn't be allowed on the
63:33 on the the grounds of wright-patterson
63:36 Air Force Base special hangars that have
63:38 UFOs in them or area 51 it has
63:40 supposedly UFOs in s for all that stuff
63:44 I'm still trying to figure out what s
63:46 four might stand for that's Bob Lazar is
63:48 big claim right I'm toying with this
63:51 this UFO thing for a split second
63:53 because it starts to reveal some of the
63:56 layers of concealment and vulnerability
64:00 that we have as human beings how many of
64:03 you raise your hand would want to
64:06 believe or what sorry would want to be
64:08 shown the evidence that aliens exist on
64:10 this planet or have been here there's
64:14 that old comment I forgot the guy's name
64:16 but he said somehow in the 50s I think
64:18 he said we have the technology to send
64:20 et home that's a pretty interesting
64:24 quote maybe the guy was being verba or
64:28 you know arrogant in his knowledge of
64:32 science you know I don't think the
64:35 individual well actually I'm not sure
64:37 how much aerospace this guy had as a
64:39 backer he may be SuperDuper expert I
64:41 can't remember but he was fairly senior
64:44 guy it was
64:45 it was you know noted as saying this
64:48 aliens have been used as a secondary
64:51 mechanism to confirm the moon landings
64:53 by saying that obviously the moon has
64:56 aliens on it and that's why we didn't go
64:58 back because they said don't come back
65:00 this is our place
65:02 that's one of the recent ones hatched in
65:04 last five years it's been going on for
65:08 for more than years and that but there
65:09 was a book written about it and I
65:11 covered that one of my previous episodes
65:14 what's interesting about the moon
65:16 landing thing and an individual's
65:19 journey in this wild ride which is the
65:24 moon hoax is that I have not heard a
65:27 person other than Joe Rogan he is the
65:31 only human being I know that came out
65:33 with the truth that we didn't go and
65:35 later again when he monetized his show
65:38 and got it into mainstream media he
65:41 flipped but it's you know when he talked
65:43 to Alex Jones about it again I think you
65:46 could see in his face he isn't
65:49 completely convinced we did go it looks
65:51 like he's still kind of going do you
65:54 think we went do you really think we
65:55 went I mean he had that whole sort of
65:57 tone which really warmed my heart I
66:00 think you could look at Joe Rogan and
66:02 know that the guy is a pretty stand-up
66:05 dude I mean he he knows where his bread
66:09 is buttered as they say so he's got a
66:12 probably in his mind do what he needs to
66:15 do but if I were him I would if I
66:21 genuinely believed genuinely believed
66:22 that there was a level of valid
66:28 skepticism about it I change I changed
66:32 my tune
66:32 you got your show hey they could D
66:36 syndicate him and try to yank his
66:40 funding or whatever but he's got power
66:43 now he's got juice if he went off the
66:45 air with one channel he could start
66:47 another channel in a different service
66:49 it's not going to limit his freedom of
66:51 speech he'll be back on the air he'll
66:54 probably get much higher ad revenue as
66:56 well because he'll be totally in charge
66:58 it's kind of like the guy that made what
67:00 is it Mike judge you made beavis and
67:03 butt-head he said he never made any
67:04 money of any major amount doing Beavis
67:07 and Butthead it's when he created the
67:11 other cartoon which alludes me right now
67:13 the name of it it's the sort of
67:15 white-trash guys
67:18 cartoon but then he did office space and
67:21 he's got tons of tons of ways he makes
67:24 cash now but he could be himself that's
67:26 the cool thing I think too that we have
67:29 to probably brace ourselves for a battle
67:33 if we ever were to get to a point where
67:37 at least American citizens who believe
67:39 in the moon landing or to reach 50% of
67:42 dissent where they're like you know what
67:44 I don't think we did if it reached that
67:47 point where 51% in climbing because the
67:50 snowball is going down the hill and
67:52 getting bigger and bigger which is
67:53 happening right now there would be most
67:57 likely the standard techniques of trying
68:00 to assassinate the messengers to somehow
68:03 inject a level of doubt in the validity
68:07 of what people have to say against their
68:10 official narrative you know I
68:13 interviewed bart sibrel who have a lot
68:15 of respect for and you know he and I
68:18 don't believe all the things that's
68:20 exactly the same I think we believe the
68:23 the moon hoax stuff the same but he's a
68:25 very different person than me which is
68:26 very cool but the very first time I ever
68:30 mentioned him to a colleague of mine in
68:32 Hollywood the first thing that came out
68:36 of his mouth was oh yeah that guy you
68:39 know that guy is really weird you know
68:41 that guy and he was sort of trying to
68:42 insinuate there's something wrong with
68:44 Bart Bart's a dude that is an open book
68:50 I mean he's not trying to hide anything
68:51 about his life he has published hundreds
68:55 of videos about his whole life what he's
68:57 done you know like he's does commercials
68:59 and and little short features and all
69:02 kinds of stuff I mean he's just he's his
69:04 own man does his own thing but people
69:06 try to assassinate his character which
69:10 you know
69:11 part of it was a denial process with a
69:14 person I'm talking to because they don't
69:16 want to go there I have friends of mine
69:19 that believe almost every single
69:21 conspiracy on planet earth but when the
69:25 moon thing comes up man they run the
69:27 other way they run the other way they
69:29 change the subject and I don't try to
69:32 fight them or anything you know I just
69:33 let them I just oh that's one of those
69:35 subjects you're not ready for I'm not
69:38 the guy to pound it into you it's a it's
69:41 an heirloom to their history it warms
69:44 their heart it's an accomplishment of
69:47 man that they don't want to let go of I
69:50 get it
69:51 believe me I get it some people more
69:53 sensitive than others you know it is my
69:58 hope that before the 50th anniversary we
70:00 have as little collateral damage as
70:02 possible you know Buzz Aldrin's looking
70:06 really old nowadays I can't explain the
70:10 video where he's talking to a child
70:13 who's eight years old the little girl
70:14 asks asks him why haven't we been back
70:17 in 50 years and he says that doesn't
70:21 sound like a question from an
70:23 eight-year-old that sounds like a
70:24 question from an adult that gave it to
70:26 you but the reason why we haven't been
70:27 back is because we didn't and you're
70:30 like okay well buzz is on record several
70:33 times saying things that are completing
70:35 criminais ting you know he said again
70:37 supposedly Jerry anism has this video
70:39 but they have wiped this video off the
70:40 internet in a way that you cannot find
70:42 it period if any of you can find this
70:45 you want some homework to make me
70:47 absolutely static find me the clip that
70:51 I have seen multiple times of my own
70:53 eyes where Buzz Aldrin is on live news
70:57 with some little tiny news organization
71:00 I think it was Arizona or something like
71:01 that but he was coming in from a
71:03 satellite and they were asking him about
71:05 the Mars missions and one of his closing
71:07 statements was well you know when we
71:09 figure out how to go to the moon it'll
71:11 be a lot easier to get to Mars and the
71:14 new staff would what what do you mean
71:18 and people try to say that you know
71:23 some people have seen it and they're you
71:26 know they're still for the moon mission
71:27 and so what they say is oh he just made
71:31 a mistake he said the wrong thing then
71:33 you go ok how do you reconstruct that
71:35 sentence to make any sense at all
71:37 besides the moon itself where else could
71:40 we possibly go in space that would make
71:42 it easier to get to Mars no where
71:45 supposedly we're going to the ISS so we
71:49 got 200 miles up to 50 somewhere in
71:51 there all right he said it and he meant
71:55 it god bless him for slipping I hope
72:02 he's alive on July 19th I really am but
72:05 I have my doubts and they could if he
72:08 passes away in his sleep between now and
72:10 the 19th and no one's gonna question it
72:12 at least an official narrative even me I
72:15 mean I'd be coming on well he looked
72:17 pretty bad I mean he look pretty old
72:18 look pretty weathered if something
72:21 happened he had a heart attack a stroke
72:22 he had an aneurysm in the middle of
72:24 night well you know it's technically in
72:27 the books it's technically something a
72:29 guy of his age could medically
72:32 experience
72:32 I hope he's alive I hope all the
72:36 astronauts alive and I hope somebody has
72:37 the guts to say that they're gonna read
72:40 the speech has been prepared for them
72:42 and they walk right up to that podium on
72:44 live television and they say well you
72:47 know I'm here to tell you that I never
72:48 stepped on the moon I don't know about
72:50 all these other guys but I never stepped
72:54 on the moon and if they had a partner or
72:57 two other guys that they are with they
72:58 go and I was with that guy and that guy
73:01 the entire time that I was supposed to
73:03 be on the moon but I wasn't I was in
73:05 Hawaii I was in low orbit or whatever I
73:08 was in a jumbo jet and they chopped the
73:12 mic and they go on with life now let's
73:15 say if that happens gosh if the Lord
73:20 exists it'd be so awesome to see that
73:22 happen right and the other two guys
73:26 could come up to the podium ago I don't
73:27 know what he's talking about I was there
73:29 I got all my accolades and life all set
73:31 up my pension is being threatened if I
73:33 say anything the other guys like you
73:34 know what keep your money keep your
73:36 Saint and money keep your devil money
73:38 I'm gonna go meet my god and I'm not
73:41 gonna I'm not gonna have to tell him
73:44 that I held a secret away from my fellow
73:47 man his creation my entire life he's not
73:51 gonna go out like a sucker you know one
73:54 of the greatest confirmations that we
73:55 didn't go to the moon has happened in
73:57 2019 and 2018 when China said they'd put
74:01 a rover on the moon and sent us back
74:03 dirt clod photographs of the moon's
74:07 surface
74:07 it's absolutely hysterical absolutely
74:12 hysterical does it remotely look like
74:14 the moon that NASA forged in 1969 with
74:18 all little craters everywhere none of
74:20 that there's like a couple couple
74:21 craters but they're real smooth and
74:23 weird China has helped us out and
74:26 because NASA endorsed and the United
74:29 States of America endorsed China's two
74:31 landings on the moon that that confirms
74:36 that they went along with their hoax to
74:39 keep their own hoax protected Israel's
74:43 satellite didn't land and the only photo
74:47 you got from Israel's thing was this
74:49 composite shot in Photoshop where they
74:51 had this horrible model of the moon
74:55 surface which just to scale if you look
74:57 at the moon and look at this this fake
74:59 surface they've put together with the
75:02 lily Israeli flag and stuff in the
75:03 foreground and you know they said they
75:05 got this one shot before it hit the
75:07 moon's surface it's all fake it's all
75:11 completely fake it looks fake
75:12 give me a break and I have to say about
75:18 anyone who participated in moon hoax is
75:20 listening from the original 60s and 70s
75:22 missions but I have to say hats off to
75:26 you guys for at least making the thing
75:28 look believable up to a certain point
75:30 the forged moon surface was brilliant
75:34 you know too bad you use the same set
75:36 twice and two different missions but I
75:38 know that's not your problem that's a
75:40 budgetary constraint or some sort of
75:42 time table constraint it heads off hats
75:47 off man the place look like the thing I
75:49 look at when I look it through my
75:50 telescope so I think you feel me we have
75:55 an interesting year ahead of us again
75:57 July 20th all this will be over we won't
76:00 have to worry about it we'll go back to
76:02 the zero-sum game of us trying to shake
76:06 out more evidence and I'm sure that this
76:08 year we're going to come up with some
76:10 more concrete evidence as to what's
76:12 going on I am sorry that I don't have
76:15 enough time to go out and do interviews
76:17 like a lot of other YouTube shows where
76:19 I get you know someone on the horn and
76:20 we have a conversation about air
76:22 conditioning systems or battery systems
76:24 or rote memory systems to be able to
76:27 really prove beyond a shadow of a doubt
76:29 that this stuff is crap but you know I
76:33 think the the number of smoking guns we
76:35 have is just off the charts and it
76:37 increased dramatically over the last 12
76:39 months so to all of you who have been
76:41 contributing in the in the comments
76:43 sections about this hoax I can't thank
76:48 you enough it has it has increased the
76:51 integrity of my conversation a million
76:53 fold we're trying to talk about paper
76:57 mache rocks or you know cross hairs
77:00 disappearing in Hasselblad shots was
77:02 always something that someone could
77:03 overlook the air-condition battery thing
77:06 is the new smoking gun of smoking guns
77:10 it is a white-hot butter knife you know
77:14 cutting through butter super simple
77:16 super simple so keep that in your quiver
77:19 if you have conversations if you know
77:22 someone your family or again you are one
77:24 of these people that have commented and
77:26 we actually have some pretty good
77:27 empirical evidence in the comments if
77:31 you have other outside world you know
77:34 Wikipedia like pages to simply talk
77:37 about the science of air conditioning
77:39 the science of battery technology that
77:41 we could reference as a mere moment of
77:45 proof then please provide those links
77:48 I'd say go get them fast
77:50 right after you see this video because
77:52 they're gonna watch this video most
77:54 likely some Intel guys gonna watch the
77:55 video and try to
77:56 after those pages and make modifications
77:58 they've recently said that the Earth's
78:01 atmosphere actually stretches around the
78:03 moon goddamn is that insane I mean wow
78:08 what what new platform of [ __ ] you
78:13 know science are they trying to launch
78:15 to hide the fact that this isn't true
78:17 and again flat-earthers you're like of
78:19 course it is it's inside the dome you
78:20 know well you may be right who knows man
78:24 so you know it's it's incredibly
78:30 fascinating so again for those of you
78:33 who are carrying the flag thank you very
78:35 much if you have a minute deep thoughts
78:38 radio.com please go that's where all the
78:40 feeds are so becoming on video you can
78:42 change the podcast podcast you can go to
78:44 video there's a locked Facebook group of
78:46 some of the coolest people on planet
78:48 Earth
78:48 Twitter page in case you like to get
78:50 your notifications and that technology
78:52 there's two methods to donate to the
78:53 show patreon and PayPal so enjoy that
78:57 and there's a new link to season one
78:59 remastered we need 4000 hours to be
79:03 consumed of season one before it can be
79:05 monetized I do want to get it to that
79:06 level got a hundred videos in there just
79:09 turn on the ads and forget about that
79:11 channel but they are much much better
79:14 they're losing on average five to ten
79:19 minutes of of smoking and and me sitting
79:23 there just thinking so I am compressing
79:25 the the videos quite a bit the audio
79:27 levels are balanced better now and so
79:30 it's it's a lot easier to watch let's
79:33 just put that way and again some of
79:35 those videos are banned in Europe so if
79:36 you're coming in from Europe and you
79:38 haven't seen your you're at Deep thought
79:40 a holic go ahead and subscribe to that
79:43 channel it's got twenty-one subscribers
79:44 right now I'm hoping it you hit over a
79:46 hundred here real soon again it's not
79:49 going to grow after it hits 100 it will
79:50 just be those those hundred episodes but
79:55 if we can get it over that hump then I
79:56 can turn on the ads so anyway take care
79:59 of yourself and someone else and I'll
80:01 see you in the next deep thoughts over
80:03 now
