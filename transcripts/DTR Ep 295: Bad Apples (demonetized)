00:00 [Music]
00:33 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen today I thought we would talk
00:40 about bad apples
00:44 sounds like why why the hell what are
00:48 you talking about dude we all know them
00:51 for sure but so the theme of the show
00:56 forever has been to rebuild the world
01:00 from the bottom up all right when you
01:04 rebuild that means there was something
01:06 already there and you're gonna rebuild
01:09 it which usually means some form of
01:12 demolition real reorganization
01:16 reevaluation we're gonna find out what
01:20 rules we plan on following as a society
01:23 if we even pick a rule like common law
01:27 do no harm well we have to figure out
01:29 what that means and how to enforce it
01:32 you all know this but why did we have to
01:37 rebuild it how did he get a lot of whack
01:40 was it strictly a lack of understanding
01:43 and an organic problem that was created
01:46 by society for sure those things have
01:48 occurred right what we didn't know we
01:50 didn't know cigarettes were lethal now
01:54 given the lack of sickness related to
01:56 cigars it's interesting the cigarettes
01:59 I think did start of becoming almost
02:02 eugenics program you know let's take it
02:04 does not make it out of tobacco let's
02:06 make it out of paper and then let's
02:07 start putting in chemical after chemical
02:08 after chemical I think The Killers
02:11 probably knew that particular one
02:13 was getting more lethal by the second
02:16 the citizens didn't understand so they
02:18 sucked it down until we've had an
02:20 epidemic of deaths related to it right
02:23 but there are things that we have done
02:25 to accidentally hurt ourselves all right
02:27 fine this episode is about the other
02:31 thing that happens the bad apples now
02:37 wouldn't it be difficult to make an
02:40 episode about bad apples I mean is there
02:42 really that much to talk about
02:43 yeah there's bad apples and everything
02:46 right hmm well I think that we need to
02:51 specifically explode this notion of a
02:55 bad apple we need to analyze how they
02:58 occur where they occur and what you do
03:01 when you find one because I think it's
03:04 going to be sort of an advanced course a
03:08 300 level course in your PhD of
03:11 rebuilding this planet if you ever get
03:13 the chance to do so it's an upper in
03:16 concept thing when we start exploding
03:20 the concept when you talk about human
03:23 bad apples we know what they are a lot
03:26 easier than how they were made don't we
03:31 a lot of times they're bad apples out
03:34 there and we have no idea how they were
03:35 made how did Dick Cheney [ __ ] become
03:37 this you know a lot of the bad apples we
03:40 refer to on this show as sociopaths
03:46 people who see themselves different than
03:49 the rest of the population
03:50 which in some cases isn't hard and
03:53 therefore they operate outside of the
03:56 distinctions and the laws that are held
03:59 together by the masses which they do not
04:03 see themselves a part of the sociopaths
04:06 of the world and there are several
04:07 species of them is that you because of
04:13 their neurotic nature because of their
04:17 lack of integration with society they
04:19 tend to inherit focus now if our
04:23 celebrity a celebrity might focus simply
04:25 because they are
04:26 focusing out of a desire to reach goal
04:28 but some folks don't have the choice
04:31 right
04:33 they are usually odd people though in
04:37 the first layer the first layer are the
04:39 outcasts you have and I am not
04:43 criticizing any of these individuals I
04:45 will mention I really think that they
04:48 have had troubled childhoods in one way
04:52 or another they weren't accepted one way
04:54 or the other and that caused an
04:55 isolation to occur and thus potentially
05:00 a sociopathic behavior now some people
05:02 will go into this and come out of it
05:05 right and I mentioned a couple of these
05:09 before but we're in the middle of bad
05:11 apples here right now there are many
05:16 more than three categories but the three
05:19 that I recognize are the outcasts the
05:23 ass-kissers and the engineers social
05:28 engineers in your al cast group you
05:31 might have someone like a Rudy Guiliani
05:34 who may have turned a new leaf recently
05:37 hopefully a Condoleezza Rice both
05:42 extremely intelligent human beings
05:45 Condoleezza Rice is nothing short of a
05:49 prodigy but she's also very left brain
05:53 she's the concert pianist but in the
05:55 left brain way not oniy I wrote my own
05:57 Sonata
05:58 sort of thing and so once you're very
06:02 left brain you can be brainwashed very
06:04 easily because you you get your
06:06 alkaloids through hanging onto paradigms
06:08 right you Rudy Guiliani
06:12 I don't know lost his hair pretty fast
06:16 has a little speech impediment doesn't
06:19 have anything to do with his quality as
06:21 a human being or his ability to think
06:25 in ingenious manners became an attorney
06:31 I'm willing to bet there's a little
06:33 ridicule there there's a little bit of
06:34 isolation there now sometimes these
06:37 people have no idea that they're being
06:39 ridiculed they're so innocent in sweet I
06:42 don't know
06:43 I think Condoleezza Rice as I've read
06:46 graduated high school like sixteen years
06:48 old she's a prodigy child so she looks a
06:52 little awkward you know in one realm
06:55 she's very beautiful in another realm if
06:57 you compared all the other Malibu girls
07:00 she's not you know meeting those
07:01 requirements who knows how she was
07:04 treated but when you're smart I can just
07:06 simply tell you from experience you can
07:08 become an outcast because you know
07:12 things it just happens right now your
07:17 ass kissers are interesting they
07:20 typically grow up in very disciplined
07:22 families and when they go into their
07:25 private sector lives they always need
07:27 someone to tell them what to do your
07:30 colon pals your your other generals and
07:36 I'm just trying to give a really good
07:38 one
07:39 Cullen Powell is a really good one
07:41 there's a lot of benefits and to being
07:44 told everything to do especially if what
07:46 you're told to do seems to be overall
07:48 the right thing in the end you're like
07:50 man I didn't even know but I did this
07:52 and I got an alkylate imagine an actor
07:55 an actor reads lines off a script and
07:58 someone comes up to the layer and says
08:00 you're so amazing as the hero and it's
08:02 like the whole concept for the hero was
08:05 in the in the mind of the writer who
08:07 could be the director or the producer or
08:09 just a plain writer the actor just is
08:12 either handsome or beautiful and was
08:14 reading lines getting the credit for
08:18 being Luke Skywalker or Indiana Jones or
08:22 whatever now of course if there's a lot
08:24 of sequels those actors will through
08:27 saying the lines become the embodiment
08:30 of those characters but your engineers
08:33 are you're Donna Rumsfeld's you're Henry
08:38 Kissinger's
08:39 your dick chaney they have a lot of
08:41 brain power that is being wasted for
08:44 whatever reason they get it they get the
08:47 world as they need to get it and then
08:49 they have their own biases their own
08:51 prejudices maybe maybe one of us maybe
08:54 one I'm just trying to be functionally
08:56 sound when it comes to the population
08:58 maybe one wants to save the economy and
09:00 they just become myopically focused to a
09:05 point where human life doesn't have the
09:08 same connotation that it did prior to
09:12 them having these epiphanies or maybe it
09:14 never did
09:15 maybe they always saw the the bloodline
09:18 of mankind just as a straight-up
09:22 functional thing you know so we have
09:27 been blessed in my opinion and I
09:30 certainly certainly hope I don't have to
09:31 eat these words I will if I have to but
09:36 we have a phenomenon going on in 2018
09:39 started in 2017 called queue and on who
09:43 according to him
09:44 preferably owe him a ton of bad apples
09:48 have been discovered trying to overthrow
09:50 the United States government in just
09:54 unbelievably blatant and then in some
09:57 cases unbelievably covert who's stealing
10:03 our uranium to give it to people that
10:05 would threaten us with it later using
10:09 nuclear disarmament as a mechanism to
10:13 steal billions of dollars to the tune of
10:16 half a billion
10:18 sorry half a trillion dollars straight
10:21 out of the taxpayers money foundations
10:25 that are paid for play so you get a high
10:27 level of status in the government and
10:31 then you can use it you know this in
10:35 rumors go back as far as what was it
10:39 Truman Truman extorting money out of
10:41 people so they can get paid for their
10:43 services for World War two and the idea
10:47 is that oh I'm gonna make a bunch of
10:49 people millionaires and billionaires
10:52 as the president United States but I get
10:54 nothing but this pittance and the answer
10:59 is well you don't have to make all these
11:00 people
11:01 super duper rich but it will happen if
11:03 you want to create a goddamn war and you
11:05 got to feed half a million to a million
11:07 and a half soldiers and move them all
11:09 over the world yeah there's gonna be
11:10 companies that are gonna form out of
11:12 thin air and they're gonna make a ton of
11:13 money on this but hey why just don't
11:15 start a war [ __ ] and then you want to
11:17 have this big jealousy bubble and you
11:19 won't do extortion
11:23 bribes so I will tell you that if you
11:30 adopt the notion of bad apples being
11:33 sociopaths and and put them in the
11:35 category of your prodigy child that was
11:39 treated poorly as a kid if they kind of
11:42 got to the point where they said you
11:45 know screw all you people you treated me
11:47 badly the year now my enemy I will
11:50 destroy you
11:50 that's Obama's big thing right he had a
11:53 drop of black blood in him and he is now
11:57 hating all the white men and his
11:59 brothers who are from Kenya are
12:01 pitch-black and they're like no clue
12:03 what it's like to be really
12:05 discriminated against okay then you have
12:09 your ass kissers the guys that have to
12:11 be told everything or otherwise they
12:14 don't know what they're doing usually
12:16 those people become military or finance
12:20 you know some sort of person that never
12:23 makes a decision for themselves
12:24 some of them pretend like they do which
12:26 is really funny and then you have your
12:29 social engineers your uber geniuses that
12:33 are just nuts just [ __ ] crazy
12:36 compared to our standards of life and
12:38 it's sort of one of these things like
12:41 the the threshold between insanity and
12:44 brilliance they live on that threshold
12:45 every day of their lives right once you
12:49 can see the world through those three
12:51 filters when you're evaluating what you
12:53 believe to be bona fide bad apples in
12:56 society it'll help you deal with your
13:02 resolution
13:04 of their existence on this planet but
13:07 we're in a state now well we have to
13:09 find the bad apples we do if we don't
13:15 then this is going to repeat forever and
13:18 ever and ever and it may repeat forever
13:19 and ever and ever
13:20 anyway right but at least we'll know
13:25 what's going on and where you can build
13:28 automated systems to find them right
13:31 what we want to do is fix things by
13:34 design I'm gonna give you an example you
13:38 know that we'd most of us in the world
13:42 live on a fiat currency system meaning
13:43 it's not backed by anything it's all
13:46 made up banks just literally put digits
13:49 into a computer and make money out of
13:52 thin air it doesn't exist
13:55 you stay poor they stay rich because
13:57 they have the privilege by simply
14:00 knowing where to type in the digits to
14:01 create money from nothing
14:03 we call it quantitative easing in this
14:06 country now you guys have heard of scams
14:14 back in the day there was a movie office
14:16 space which did a reprise the love it's
14:18 the one like it was the second Superman
14:20 of the third Superman Richard Pryor
14:22 Richard Pryor was a hacker and you know
14:25 there's when you have billions of
14:27 transactions happening every day if you
14:28 can siphon off a fraction of a penny
14:31 then you can and deposit that into
14:34 account
14:34 eventually the fractions add up to money
14:36 and over the course of ten years you
14:38 might be able to come away with a
14:39 million plus dollars no one notices
14:43 because it's a fraction of a percent now
14:46 those scams are long over all right
14:48 anyone pulling that scam is just kidding
14:51 themselves but how would we fix that
14:53 problem it only happened in America that
14:58 I know of in the 70s may have
15:00 technically happened the 60s by thing it
15:01 was mainly a 70s early 70s scams like
15:04 three guys got together I think 73 or
15:06 something like that but we diluted our
15:09 money so much that they were then buying
15:13 things with thousands of dollars of the
15:16 United States money
15:17 when we used to buy it with tens of
15:19 dollars what do I mean okay so my
15:25 grandparents used to brag that they
15:27 could go out to dinner in a movie for
15:28 about 15 cents 15 cents you can fit that
15:31 in your pocket right in a couple coins
15:33 two or three coins diamond or nickel
15:35 whatever three nickels depending on you
15:38 know dinners the dinners a dime and then
15:40 movies a nickel I mean Jesus isn't that
15:42 sound awesome but what have we done well
15:47 the game that we keep playing to make
15:49 people rich is that we don't play it but
15:52 we allow it to be played around us is
15:54 that they keep inflating money meaning
15:58 they keep dividing it and dividing it
16:00 and dividing it to the point where all
16:02 kinds of skimming scams can occur now if
16:08 you wanted to take one penny from my
16:10 grandfather and whatever 1932 he's
16:16 courting my grandmother they're going
16:19 out for fifteen cents and I still a
16:21 penny from my grandfather don't you
16:25 think he'd notice because what is that
16:27 in today's money today it cost about
16:29 thirty bucks to go to the movie theater
16:31 it would cost you anywhere from 40 to 60
16:33 bucks California to go to dinner so I'm
16:36 stealing about a $10 note out of my
16:39 grandfather's wallet he's gonna notice
16:44 but today if he was still alive and
16:47 spending the nearly hundred dollars for
16:51 the evening
16:51 and I stole a penny of his wallet or
16:55 pocket or whatever changed or he's never
16:57 gonna notice I could say Oh quarter
16:58 twenty five times that amount of money
17:00 right so if we ever replace our money I
17:03 wrote a paper on this ten years ago I
17:05 think that deflating our currency count
17:08 is absolutely mandatory it doesn't
17:14 change how much money you have in any
17:16 way shape or form it just means that a
17:18 Penny's worth a hell of a lot more now
17:20 your current printed currency and coins
17:22 would not be eligible for this deflation
17:27 we'd make all brand-new units
17:30 but imagine instead of making $100,000 a
17:33 year you make $1000 a year instead of
17:37 paying $150 for a fabulous dinner and a
17:43 movie or whatever a theater ticket
17:46 you're back to a nickel for each one of
17:49 those things 15 cents for the whole
17:53 night
17:54 now by design anyone siphoning fractions
17:58 of a penny off of a transaction at a
18:00 bank board the bank's going to notice
18:02 real fast right because a fraction of a
18:05 penny is a [ __ ] ton of money when you're
18:07 deflated down to decent levels the
18:12 carpool lane of California if you're
18:16 driving it and you get caught it's three
18:19 hundred and forty one dollars first
18:23 thing I think of when I see that $1 is
18:26 how much that $1 worth when the entire
18:29 states penalties are tallied it's a [ __ ]
18:33 ton of money I bet you probably not
18:36 worth a million a month because I
18:37 thought we have a million violators a
18:39 month but it's probably worth several
18:40 hundred thousand I bet we have a hundred
18:42 thousand violators in carpooling a month
18:45 all the highways in California sure
18:48 they're not everywhere what's out there
18:51 so how do you fix a bad apples by design
18:54 about apples typically have one thing in
18:57 common is that's their source of
18:59 Education the source of their surname
19:01 the source of their relationships it's
19:06 very very rare that a bad apple will
19:08 simply manifest out of thin air and go I
19:11 was a good person and now I'm a piece of
19:12 [ __ ] that destroys society no they have
19:16 comrades they have leadership they have
19:18 mentorship they engage in a certain
19:22 philosophical study that is either pro
19:26 or against life in general freedom in
19:30 general the Constitution in general if
19:33 someone's running around thinking that
19:34 they are utterly prosecuted by one way
19:37 or another they're gay and they think
19:38 the whole world hates because they're
19:40 gay they're not white and they
19:42 that there's white privilege and they're
19:45 being repressed okay well you can see by
19:50 design their preferences and their
19:52 biases for what needs to be fixed and
19:55 what is okay and then we can take those
20:00 biases study what we believe to be the
20:03 true problems of this country and see if
20:06 we actually need that help right you
20:10 know America we're a melting pot right
20:13 I mean Europe's only recently become a
20:16 true melting pot where they're pushing
20:17 each other together again we're never
20:20 gonna agree on what needs to be fixed in
20:22 general but a bad apple is someone who
20:26 is serving the few to benefit the few at
20:32 the expense of the masses
20:34 right of the mini the bad apples happen
20:40 in your work on your neighborhood in
20:43 your neighborhood when you walk down the
20:45 street of your favorite town you'll have
20:49 people that are jerks and people that
20:50 are nice luckily the state of affairs at
20:55 least where I've been in life most
20:58 people are nice even cities like New
21:00 York that are rumored to be so brutal
21:03 you know you kept hearing like a lot of
21:05 the first comedians of the world came
21:06 out of New York stand up and a lot of
21:09 the stand up of the world was like we're
21:10 tough or mean and you know you don't
21:12 talk to anybody in this and believe me
21:14 there are areas in New York where you
21:15 know I wouldn't just walk down a street
21:18 at night but the weird thing was is that
21:21 as I started meeting New York friends of
21:23 mine they had the biggest hearts on
21:26 planet Earth they were the most loyal
21:28 they were the most stand-up they're
21:31 lifers I mean we're literally family
21:34 members and so I'm sitting and looking
21:35 at it and they come from the toughest
21:37 neighborhoods in New York and I'm
21:39 sitting there going why do you guys or
21:43 how are you so nice but you guys tell me
21:46 that where you come from is so mean
21:48 are you literally going back to Cali you
21:51 know you're escaping New York because
21:52 you're nice I
21:55 smokin smoke lounges well smoke lounges
21:58 have lots of people from New York come
22:00 through because New York is so [ __ ]
22:02 upside-down right there what is it
22:05 they're DEA or Attorney General's like
22:07 some [ __ ] woman-beater for Christ's
22:09 sake but I meet them and they're the
22:11 nicest most intelligent like wise people
22:15 like New York makes wise people but
22:17 anyway I go there twice in like the last
22:20 10 years how the time in my life and I'm
22:25 not really playing the tourist thing I'm
22:26 really there on business I'm walking the
22:29 streets at night I mean I went out at 11
22:32 o'clock at night in Manhattan you know
22:33 I've taken subways down to Little Italy
22:36 in Brooklyn and middle of the evening
22:39 and it's like I never fear for my life
22:41 you know I'm sure I could make that
22:45 happen unfortunately but we have areas
22:48 of the world that breed wonderful people
22:51 we have areas of the world that seemed
22:53 to breed the demise of humanity we have
22:59 folks that come from places in the world
23:01 where it's more functional you know like
23:03 New York for me my experience with my
23:05 friends from there from my visits there
23:07 and I sat down interview people when I
23:09 was there I said oh what's the deal with
23:10 this your town being known to be so dark
23:14 and I'm here and it's like you guys are
23:15 it's not like Disneyland or anything but
23:18 it's it's like it's more calm the people
23:23 are more like kind of minding their own
23:25 business in a really healthy way but if
23:29 I needed help I could talk to people and
23:31 I don't ask cops for a lot of help
23:32 because they're very busy right you
23:35 don't they're not tours guides for New
23:37 York you need help though you know
23:40 they'll help you just be good to him
23:43 because they they take a lot of [ __ ] on
23:45 a daily basis but anyway like I said I
23:48 lived in the Bay Area for 12 years holy
23:51 [ __ ] these people walk around a lot of
23:54 them I'm trying to be so smart and so
23:57 deep and so spiritual and there's sort
24:02 of anything but it's weird I'd sit in a
24:06 restaurant eating food
24:08 I'm paying a lot of money for the
24:10 experience or I'm not paying a lot of
24:11 money doesn't matter and these guys
24:14 would be protesting outside then they
24:16 push into the businesses and they go
24:17 table to table you know asking you the
24:23 most confrontational [ __ ] you could
24:25 possibly imagine
24:26 you know if someone asks you about your
24:30 opinion on abortion for instance or do
24:32 you think Jesus Christ exists
24:34 holy [ __ ] you have a 50/50 chance of
24:37 answering it according to their crazy
24:40 eyes looking back at you are you do are
24:46 you a Republican are you a Democrat
24:48 it's just polarizing things but no one
24:51 has any business walking around
24:55 instigating because it's just gonna you
24:57 know it's gonna cause problems right I
25:00 think the barrier breeds utter delusion
25:03 in a lot of cases but there's the
25:06 functional layer of the berry the
25:08 Silicon Valley layer which is heads down
25:11 inventing making things happen making
25:13 the world better so you got that layer
25:15 at the same place of the layer where you
25:19 have again I've never seen more gay
25:21 bashing in my life in San Francisco but
25:25 it's known in the United States of
25:26 America is one of the capitals of
25:28 tolerance for homosexuals how's that
25:31 possible
25:32 those two exists in the same exact place
25:35 it's an interesting training camp when
25:37 you go to it because your sister you
25:39 have no real opinion and you go on you
25:42 go in that into that region and you see
25:44 these people hating these other people
25:46 but there's nothing wrong with these
25:48 other people and you're looking at these
25:49 people are hating and you're like well
25:52 you're saying you're so righteous and
25:53 good and you're going to heaven or
25:55 whatever and these people aren't these
25:58 people are nice these people don't
25:59 bother me but you're [ __ ] annoying me
26:02 I'm trying to eat a goddamn piece of
26:03 pizza and you're up in my face my point
26:08 for mentioning this is that there are
26:09 regions of the world that tend to build
26:11 into their boring [ __ ] lives
26:13 strife they live for these political
26:17 agendas right I mean think about it and
26:20 Tifa
26:22 the biggest [ __ ] bunch of [ __ ]
26:24 the most fascist goddamn group of people
26:27 that have existed since the [ __ ]
26:29 Nazis right absolutely positively the
26:33 living incarnate of [ __ ] fascism
26:36 calls themselves anti-fascism because
26:40 they're idiots they're just [ __ ]
26:41 morons right there are states where
26:46 those organizations thrive because their
26:49 society is I don't know not so goddamn
26:53 smart and so they're breeding ignorant
26:56 right it's usually some [ __ ] weird
26:59 cult II person like a George Soros
27:01 that's like just trying to upset the
27:04 applecart trying to destroy freedom to
27:07 bring in fascism socialism and laughing
27:12 the entire [ __ ] way how stupid these
27:14 people are if they're the cause you know
27:19 we have I think rehabilitated out of a
27:22 lot of the the situation I'm about to
27:25 talk about but it's still true to some
27:27 extent and the people the local leaders
27:29 understand this is a problem in there I
27:31 think making a lot of headway fixing it
27:34 but you know when the secret alphabet
27:38 agencies of the world needed a bunch of
27:40 liquid money obviously they brought all
27:42 the drugs into areas they wanted to
27:45 destroy the ghettos the ghettos were
27:49 taken by surprise it's a weird formula
27:51 bunch of dudes make millions if not
27:53 billions of dollars reselling cocaine
27:56 and heroin and weed and all those other
27:59 stuff at the lower level the local
28:02 citizens are fighting over corners they
28:04 build up two gangs one red one blue to
28:09 really take care of this jurisdiction
28:11 battles to further destroy the community
28:15 to further get them to kill each other
28:17 and so the community that wasn't raised
28:22 in this you know the older generation
28:24 we're looking at these kids go what the
28:26 [ __ ] are you doing you're complaining
28:28 about everyone else out there who is not
28:31 us hurting us were the only people who
28:33 killed my grandchild
28:35 us and were you getting those drugs
28:38 anyway are you the one going down south
28:41 to bring that well don't you ever think
28:42 about where you're getting it and the
28:44 guys just looking at a stack of cash
28:46 going I don't give a [ __ ] what you say
28:47 old man I didn't have this yesterday I
28:50 have it today and what I'm able to do
28:53 with my life is so much bigger now
28:54 because I got the stack of cash [ __ ] you
28:56 and your kid right as though it was
28:59 probably 94 the the absolute summit of
29:04 this era in Los Angeles right so the
29:07 complexity of a bad Apple is so
29:11 multi-dimensional you can make one out
29:12 of thin air
29:13 it was simply dangling money in front of
29:16 them it's horrendous so we have systemic
29:22 problems that create bad apples and we
29:25 have well I think it's always a systemic
29:29 issue for a lot of cases but when you
29:32 get to your social engineers I don't
29:35 think they're necessarily beaten as
29:37 children I just think they're really
29:39 smart and they're SuperDuper bored and
29:42 of course once they're recognized for
29:45 having a certain level of aptitude they
29:48 are pulled into these other
29:49 organizations right there's a lot of
29:53 parents that are super excited when
29:54 their kid shows academic brains right
29:58 who wouldn't be
30:00 what does that mean as a parent well
30:02 your kid's gonna do really really well
30:04 hopefully doesn't always mean that but
30:07 you know most times it does all right
30:10 what you don't know is the second your
30:12 kid shows some exceptional aptitude
30:16 especially if you get put in a private
30:18 school you get into a gifted program
30:21 they take some tests you'll find that
30:24 these mysterious organizations that
30:26 you've never heard of approach you with
30:29 scholarships and all kinds of stuff
30:30 you're like Dan this is awesome my kid
30:32 is going to get the top education in the
30:34 world and you wouldn't be wrong that
30:36 they're gonna get a really good
30:37 education what you don't know is how
30:40 that education is going to be applied a
30:43 lot of times genius children come out of
30:46 pretty average parents
30:48 for whatever reason it just happens the
30:50 parents are good people but they're just
30:52 average people have good meat and
30:54 potatoes kind of jobs nothing wrong with
30:57 that they created a beautiful world
30:59 they're probably geniuses at different
31:01 things but the kids will disappear into
31:04 these organizations and pop out maybe
31:09 bad apples but maybe not a bad apple
31:12 that is intentionally doing anything
31:14 like you're two Psychopaths
31:18 categorizations which is basically
31:20 you're you're persecuted genius who has
31:24 always been ostracized maybe they're not
31:26 attractive maybe they're just so ahead
31:28 of their their counterparts in school
31:31 that they there's just so much jealousy
31:33 that they can't get it done and then
31:35 there's the social engineers not those
31:37 two maybe just they're the ones that are
31:39 please tell me what to do
31:41 maybe the child's aptitude is more left
31:44 brain than right brain maybe it was
31:46 going to be right brain maybe it was
31:47 right brain as soon as they get inside
31:49 these upper educational institutions
31:52 depending on the needs of those who are
31:55 in charge of the planet at any one
31:57 particular time developed completely in
31:59 exclusively out of bad apples the child
32:02 may be groomed to be left and not right
32:06 brained which is functional logical I've
32:10 had several conversations in my lifetime
32:12 with scientists and physicians or
32:17 scientists that do surgical work who
32:21 develop surgeries who perform surgeries
32:24 and is amazing how sort of non-emotional
32:30 they are about life the loss of life and
32:34 you know they've got a good rationale
32:35 they're like look I can't focus on the
32:37 emotional side of things in fact it's
32:38 it's bred out of us and medical school
32:40 not to get attached to our patients you
32:42 see that dramatized all the time and
32:44 shows like house and of course the big
32:48 twist is that they did let their
32:50 emotions get involved and stuff amen I
32:52 don't know what's the what's the best
32:54 way I would imagine skates by case basis
32:56 but sometimes they have humanity bred
33:00 out of them
33:01 so that they may serve more efficiently
33:04 we've heard countless rumors about how
33:06 we are referred to either as sheep when
33:09 it comes time to follow or cattle when
33:13 it comes time for us to be slaughtered
33:14 in war the people who stay home from war
33:18 the Sheep the people go out for war the
33:19 cattle in the eyes of those who control
33:22 us right hopefully those that are about
33:24 to lose that control so where do we have
33:28 control over about apples ourselves
33:30 right it's one thing to know the the
33:35 several dimensions that can come that
33:37 can create a bad apple sustain about
33:39 Apple and identify about Apple but what
33:43 can we do as a society to slow down
33:49 their growth slow down their
33:52 multiplication and proliferation in
33:55 society right because we want to we want
33:56 to make sure that bad apples are pretty
33:58 hard to create and we want to
34:01 essentially make them stick out like a
34:04 sore thumb right you look at a whole
34:06 audience you put like a hundred thousand
34:08 people on the biggest stadiums in the
34:10 world and they just stick out like neon
34:12 lights that's what we want now when
34:15 there's a lot of them in society it sort
34:19 of turns into almost like that that
34:21 situation where a particular animal over
34:23 populates and they open up hunting
34:26 season right there's too many deer
34:28 there's too many wolves there's too many
34:31 whatever and they'll release the hounds
34:35 they'll release the hunters and they
34:36 will hunt those things down till they're
34:38 just barely in existence and then
34:40 everyone pulls back and they can
34:42 multiply right I would say that right
34:45 now in 2018 we are at a level of high
34:53 proliferation about apples what is
34:57 changing according to Q and on and you
35:00 know I would say this even if Q none
35:02 were not completely legit which I think
35:04 he is 100% legit he is doing such a good
35:07 job identifying the true open source
35:10 paper work on people that have
35:13 then against the people for their own
35:15 reward serving their masters in Europe
35:21 that it's going to be a lot of work it's
35:28 going to be you know like you're coming
35:31 to a yard that hasn't been mowed and a
35:33 here and it's got vines over growing a
35:36 dead stuff everywhere and you're gonna
35:38 be you're gonna make it look better for
35:41 it pretty quick but you're gonna be at
35:42 it to make it look like a Japanese
35:44 garden you're gonna be at this game for
35:46 ten years cleaning up the mess and then
35:49 you have to say how the hell did it get
35:50 this way how did someone walk away from
35:52 this yard to let it get so bad and you
35:55 have to analyze all those all those you
35:58 know historical mechanics that allowed
36:00 that to occur right I can't speak for
36:04 other countries at all but in America we
36:07 have had several things that have
36:11 contributed to the disconnection between
36:14 parents and children first and foremost
36:18 this fake you know I guess it's a real
36:23 movement based on a bunch of fake
36:24 history where the Rockefellers wanted to
36:27 get the females out there into the
36:29 workforce and tax them again telling a
36:32 female that having a child and raising a
36:34 beautiful family that's for suckers you
36:36 know you really want to define yourself
36:39 you go out and become his some sort of
36:41 industry worker and you know all these
36:45 fables stories about women being
36:47 repressed not having jobs being home and
36:49 barefoot and pregnant I'm gonna do a
36:53 show on What's My Line and we're gonna
36:55 prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that
36:56 that is just complete [ __ ] if you
37:00 need if you need a precursor to how
37:03 powerful women were and how employed
37:05 they were and how brilliant they were go
37:08 look up what's my line just say that
37:11 into YouTube it's don't get it confused
37:13 with the comedy show whose line is it
37:17 totally different what's my line means
37:18 what's my job
37:19 it started 1951 or so and it went to
37:23 1968
37:25 women were 50% of the panel panelists
37:29 and women were 50% of the guests both
37:32 famous and non famous and you will see
37:35 that women did all kinds of amazing jobs
37:39 all the way into their 80s there's a
37:41 woman that's on there that jumps off a
37:43 diving board and 90 feet up in the air
37:45 and lands in a blow-up pool I was a
37:51 belly flop and that was entertainment
37:54 because she worked at a grocery store
37:56 and that was the entertainment to get
37:58 someone into the grocery store to buy
37:59 food and this 80 year old woman is
38:03 jumping off a diving board landing in a
38:05 pool I mean give me a break
38:07 there's mayor's women at run but
38:10 continued complete battalions of
38:12 military you have hypnotists you have
38:16 engineers you have women that are rocket
38:18 designers for Lockheed Martin the list
38:20 goes on and on and on bouncers there's
38:25 one woman in there is probably a 65 year
38:28 old bouncer at a local bar in the
38:30 Midwest all right but what happened was
38:34 is when this movement to get women to
38:38 work as quickly as possible came about
38:41 and when they told them that raising
38:43 children was [ __ ] well one that did
38:47 reduce the population of this country
38:48 because a lot of people would seek
38:50 opportunity instead of building a family
38:51 I think in the 70s and 80s that was
38:53 pretty much the smaller group of folks
38:55 but what did the women want to do
38:57 quicker I watched this happen my mom was
39:00 one of them right I got lucky though I
39:01 got raised so I was probably about I
39:04 don't know six or seven if you get a kid
39:08 to six or seven and you participate
39:09 their life I think you can relax a
39:13 little bit but the moms want to have
39:15 these children and immediately work like
39:18 it is [ __ ] three months old and is in
39:21 some day care that's the game these days
39:23 in America and half of its because
39:27 they've also been taught they need stuff
39:29 you got to buy a house you got to buy a
39:31 car you got to buy that big TV you gotta
39:33 buy a sofa you gotta buy this gonna have
39:34 a full functioning [ __ ] guest room in
39:36 your house
39:37 which are like twenty-two years old it's
39:39 like are you kidding me
39:40 won't you relax a little bit you know
39:44 have a kid and just have enough room for
39:46 you your spouse and all the amenities in
39:49 the front room in the front part of your
39:51 house you need we have more kids will
39:53 bunk them up in one room I have a
39:55 two-bedroom place not a four-bedroom
39:57 place reduce your need for income so you
40:00 can raise your children novel goddamn
40:04 idea don't worry about you know it's the
40:08 other big one is I'm just gonna beat up
40:11 the family for a little bit because it's
40:13 [ __ ] today it is as creating a bunch
40:16 of shitty kids I think it's starting to
40:19 get better but I think it's only gotten
40:21 better because we've noticed these
40:23 things but I I've got friends that are
40:24 or acquaintances I should say that are
40:27 doing this you know one of the reasons
40:30 why divorce is so huge in this country
40:32 is that one we dramatize it on
40:35 television the second something goes
40:36 wrong it's the grounds for breaking up
40:38 in divorce it's just always the case
40:40 right never fight through anything right
40:43 but the other big problem is is that
40:46 people are trying to check off a
40:48 checklist when it comes to a spouse well
40:52 I just need this I don't want have to
40:53 worry about where love's coming from
40:54 check not paying attention to whether or
40:57 not they have any compatibility at all
40:58 with their partner you know these
41:02 gigantic weddings that people have okay
41:06 if you're rich and you got money set
41:08 aside go for it if you were not rich
41:11 amen you'd only be blowing a bunch of
41:15 goddamn money on a big way well this is
41:17 my wedding and Nana these girls all
41:19 [ __ ] wound up and and again it's just
41:21 magazines and [ __ ] on TV and and they're
41:25 gonna jump forty to sixty grand on a
41:26 wedding I mean it's just
41:28 it should just sound [ __ ] ridiculous
41:29 right that's 40 to 50 grand or 60 grand
41:33 or whatever that could have been yours
41:35 through a donation so you can start your
41:37 life so you do not have to work and
41:39 leave your child in the hands of someone
41:41 that ain't you it doesn't matter if your
41:43 kid has a really good upbringing with
41:45 someone else it ain't you and it needs
41:47 to be you there needs to be a bond
41:50 between
41:50 parent and child there does because
41:53 it'll pay off huge in the end but what
41:57 is compatibility these days oh they like
42:00 Game of Thrones - mm-hmm
42:03 they love McDonald's at 2:00 in the
42:06 morning - were so compatible he owns all
42:10 the Coldplay albums - mom okay
42:14 guys do it - men has nothing to do with
42:16 your compatibility you want to know how
42:17 to get compatibility figured out between
42:19 the two of you here's two exercises real
42:21 quick for ya from your uncle mark get a
42:24 piece of paper for both of you sit
42:26 across from the table such as you can't
42:27 see each other's writing define love on
42:30 a piece of paper define it he defines it
42:33 you define it write a bunch of keywords
42:34 down say whatever you want type an essay
42:36 it doesn't matter fact if you type an
42:38 essay and he's got four words that's
42:42 pretty good sign is a might be a
42:44 difference I don't know but compare what
42:46 you think love is right some people
42:48 don't give a [ __ ] about love sometimes
42:50 it is all about a functional marriage
42:51 that's even easier to be honest I know
42:55 what your kids are gonna turn into
42:56 besides robots but here's another the
42:59 second test is this new piece of paper
43:01 catcher define love he's paper fold in
43:04 half you can't see your as you can see
43:06 is now write down your purpose for being
43:10 alive why are you here on this planet
43:14 what are you what are you living for why
43:17 do you get up in the morning what's it
43:19 all about on your deathbed what is going
43:23 to have been your purpose and then
43:27 compare notes and you know what do it
43:31 with the third person in the room
43:32 because that's very that's where you you
43:36 can't [ __ ] the answers right in fact
43:39 assign the third person to grade the
43:42 similarity between the answers scary any
43:46 right but but but we both drink dr.
43:51 pepper or not Pepsi hmm that's why
43:55 divorce proceedings happen so soon right
43:59 and what I'm talking about is that
44:01 Colonel definition of why you exist
44:04 right yeah sure you're gonna either grow
44:08 a part or grow together but again if
44:10 your trajectory is defined by your
44:12 definition of love and your definition
44:14 of your reason why you're on this plane
44:16 is very similar you won't grow apart
44:20 yeah you know if your person hates
44:23 sports and they love sports well you're
44:26 already looking at two trajectories that
44:27 are going different directions but maybe
44:29 you don't care maybe don't care and
44:32 that's good that's how you're compatible
44:33 right your supplementary yin and yang
44:37 it's all good
44:39 the family is the very first step of all
44:43 human beings either being raised or
44:47 being abandoned now let's just say to go
44:51 down this thing here you're looking at
44:53 this lecture and maybe you're like well
44:56 Jesus if I've been a bad apple if I had
44:59 some bad upbringing and I had some
45:01 things upside down and backwards you
45:03 guys still got a couple things upside
45:04 down backwards the main thing is is that
45:08 to recognize at a later date and make a
45:11 change and go you know I I was Saul from
45:15 the Bible I was a serial killer of
45:17 Christians and then I saw the light and
45:22 then I became Paul a person who saved
45:25 Christians lived for Christians so I can
45:32 tell you personally having dug myself
45:34 out of several bad behaviors in my
45:37 lifetime personal ones really not ones
45:40 that really affected other people much
45:41 you know again I grew up in a household
45:44 where cynical comments were sort of made
45:46 funny it was like everything was sort of
45:49 a stand-up comedy like a linear ooze
45:51 kind of thing but not in any
45:53 tremendously constructive way and so I
45:56 had to undo that I had to recognize I
45:58 had that enemy I had to look around and
46:01 go hey you know I'm effecting people
46:02 incorrectly according to my own
46:05 standards then I had to focus and
46:08 develop methods to stop doing it and it
46:12 worked
46:13 I'm still working I work on every day of
46:14 my life so bad apples we make them
46:21 through abuse and we make them through
46:23 neglect and in some cases they just
46:26 happen right but even you're geniuses
46:29 you're your social engineer bad apples
46:35 it's still probably a neglect algorithm
46:39 they're really smart they're not have
46:42 any problem being accepted
46:43 probably they they're more handsome it's
46:48 like they're they have everything
46:51 they've been in complete control of
46:53 their life
46:54 for whatever reason they get off on the
46:57 drama of control of others if you just
47:02 think about it put yourself on their
47:04 shoes for one second take like a Henry
47:07 Kissinger all 900 pounds of him today
47:10 okay so that guy is really smart
47:16 speaks perfectly good English without
47:18 any accent he puts on the fake German
47:20 accent accent as we've been told by
47:23 several individuals who've had
47:24 full-blown normal fluid conversations
47:26 with the guy but he puts on the German
47:27 accent for some goddamn reason
47:29 or whatever that accent is but someone
47:34 comes up to you your whatever age and
47:39 they said you know what we've been
47:40 listening to you talk to people have you
47:43 got a blog a vlog and they're like I
47:46 think you have some pretty good ideas if
47:50 this problem in the world and you're
47:51 gonna beat you have been chosen to
47:53 participate and architecting this thing
47:56 and the more promise you show the more
47:58 we're just gonna release control to you
47:59 and have you deal with it because we're
48:01 busy with some other stuff really well
48:05 how many people were talking about it
48:07 and they go well the world more
48:12 specifically at this exact moment in
48:13 time the relationship between the United
48:17 States and the Middle East as it relates
48:20 to earning money and creating
48:22 opportunity for Europe the bankers not
48:26 the people of Europe
48:27 they're sheep and cattle remember but
48:30 they're not calling them that yet in
48:32 your conversation and so you feel
48:35 privileged perhaps to be invited in on
48:39 this thing
48:39 you're being celebrated for your
48:41 intelligence didn't you want to always
48:44 have your intelligence validated at some
48:46 point most people do don't you want your
48:49 life to matter what if what you did
48:54 everyday mattered police officers they
48:59 must wake up every day if they're in a
49:03 area that can use their help they're
49:06 solving crimes they're answering
49:09 domestic violence problems they're
49:11 catching drunks on the road they should
49:14 wake up every day and go god damn it if
49:16 without us there's chaos you know
49:19 there's bad apples and police
49:20 enforcement as well of course some
49:24 precincts incubate it especially if they
49:27 have Attorney General's or scumbags
49:29 who'd be women or they're pedophiles who
49:35 are mayor's in gun-free zones which are
49:38 unconstitutional at face value right but
49:42 there are people out there that create
49:43 cures people do surgeries on people they
49:48 save lives and so it matters they get
49:50 you know physicians get this thing
49:52 called we call god syndrome but they
49:55 think they can accomplish anything
49:56 and they end up dying their little
49:58 Cessna plane because they thought that
50:00 taking lessons was just something for
50:01 suckas but you start getting rewarded
50:05 and at first it starts off pretty
50:07 organic and okay you know or what we're
50:09 talking to the Middle Eastern leaders
50:11 and weren't seem to be kind of into what
50:14 we're talking about and then oh my god
50:16 site a starts pissing off side B and
50:19 everything goes to [ __ ] chaos and
50:20 you're like it was so easy guys
50:23 all you had to do was follow this little
50:26 guideline and everything was gonna be
50:28 great and so someone walks in and goes
50:32 hey how you doing you know like I well
50:34 you know what's going well for the first
50:36 two years until this [ __ ] talked to
50:39 that household
50:40 to each other off and I finally realize
50:42 I'm dealing with a bunch of children and
50:44 then the guy goes yeah they really do
50:46 act like sheep don't they they do they
50:51 go well there's always Plan B any plan B
50:56 what might be we force him that's what
50:59 we do we can do that yeah that's what
51:03 armies are for oh yeah okay so how do we
51:07 do this okay well you know we do is
51:09 we're gonna take it's gonna take about a
51:10 year to incubate up we're gonna convince
51:12 their people to fear their people and
51:15 they have the biggest army so we're
51:18 gonna also convince that leadership to
51:20 follow our plan of course once we have
51:22 that locked in place because we do
51:23 control them we're gonna have them smash
51:26 the [ __ ] out of these people and that's
51:28 going to open up the financial
51:29 opportunity to steal other oil other
51:31 resources or whatever and give it to us
51:34 and we're the third group or the C group
51:36 that's how your paychecks getting paid
51:40 interesting will he deserve it anyway
51:42 they wouldn't do what I say I said right
51:47 and so when it comes twelve months later
51:51 they think you'd incubate it up all the
51:54 propaganda to make a hey B or whatever
51:56 the equation is and it's shocking all
51:59 night a bunch of champagne comes in the
52:04 boardroom where you are
52:06 the big giant hundred inch televisions
52:09 there with HD war 8k monitor full
52:13 surround sound you're getting everything
52:15 you're getting every camera of every
52:17 freaking Tomahawk missile guided missile
52:21 you're the best show in town you have
52:25 gone from being a normal good person to
52:28 about Apple potentially right
52:31 none of this war is based on reality
52:33 it's based on some preconception about
52:35 how people should behave who should be
52:37 in control where the opportunity should
52:39 spread but you've had bias formed in
52:42 your mind by this other party you've
52:46 been defied you've been validated in
52:48 your intelligence which means that
52:50 there's this artificial knowledge in you
52:54 that they should behave according to you
52:56 but they're sovereign human beings but
52:58 in your mind they're not anymore they're
53:01 cheaper their cattle one of the two and
53:04 you've been converted life is so complex
53:07 isn't it when one groups thinks they
53:11 have it right the the fear is that they
53:16 want everyone else to be right like them
53:19 do no harm
53:21 that's why it's so beautiful and so
53:23 simple common law you ask yourself well
53:30 I've been validated I think I'm pretty
53:33 smart these are my standards for me but
53:37 maybe it's not the standards for them
53:39 unless you've walked in their shoes for
53:41 a really long time you wouldn't know
53:43 what it's like to be them it's hard to
53:47 imagine that some of the repression that
53:49 goes on around the world is something
53:51 that someone actually would ever want
53:52 and I think we understand that there are
53:54 definitely huge lists of things that no
54:00 human being wants to experience you know
54:04 and I'll throw in one that's a little
54:06 crazy but just just so we have a little
54:08 bit of contrast here of do no harm and
54:11 how you would think that that you could
54:15 answer that question really easily of
54:17 course no one wants that to happen I'm
54:19 gonna say it my own bias but there are
54:21 people that achieve a level of I think
54:25 mental instability where they mutilate
54:28 themselves physically in order to bring
54:35 pleasure because they're addicted to the
54:36 the high of the mutilation young kids I
54:41 think ten years ago really into the
54:43 slashing thing they cut themselves
54:46 sometimes it's just to get attention a
54:48 lot of times it's to get attention but
54:50 sometimes they'll just do it and quiet
54:51 and hide the scars and they don't want
54:53 anyone to know it's a personal thing
54:55 right but every single thing that one
54:58 could do to oneself physically people do
55:00 it on a daily basis because we have lost
55:05 connection with each other
55:08 they would get it from somewhere else
55:11 that's stimulant if they just simply had
55:12 choices but in their mind they don't
55:14 have choices we know they do but they
55:18 don't think they do if the second
55:21 someone colors our hair orange and we
55:24 disassociate from them because we think
55:26 orange hair is stupid
55:28 that's stupid you know someone's gay all
55:34 right maybe you don't agree with that
55:35 lifestyle but do you really have to
55:37 excommunicate the person they're not
55:40 hurting you right I suppose they could
55:42 they could come after but that's a
55:43 different type of person that's a
55:44 one-in-a-million person who's crossing
55:47 lines it's just as bad as rape in the
55:49 heterosexual world right but of course
55:51 the substrate is how are we supposed to
55:55 be you know and we get these groups that
55:59 get militant about being accepted they
56:03 want to force you to accept them they
56:05 get more chaotic as time goes on and
56:07 they are actually hurting themselves
56:09 they get bad education Zoar no education
56:11 they don't work they want to have
56:14 welfare forever they want to suck off
56:16 the dole Europe is very kind with their
56:18 citizens and providing welfare it's sort
56:23 of like the thing I've mentioned several
56:25 times where the parent messes up the kid
56:27 by ignoring them or whatever the kid
56:30 can't sustain life they can't pay rent
56:31 or anything like that so the parent just
56:35 keeps shoveling money into their child
56:36 so that the neighbors don't know that
56:39 they the parent have messed up a child
56:41 because it's part of your report card in
56:46 society well how your kids right that's
56:50 why when people have really stable
56:52 amazing humble brilliant children we
56:55 look at them and we say wow that
56:58 individual that mother that father
57:00 really has their stuff together the kids
57:04 are off you know getting duis and
57:07 running into pedestrians and killing
57:08 them yeah not so much for that parent
57:12 right but it happens don't take any
57:14 offense if you've had these things
57:15 happen to you sometimes kids just run
57:17 away from you sometimes again we get
57:19 sucked into the system and we're
57:20 terms of everything that I've said you
57:23 don't necessarily need to persecute
57:24 yourself just understand you were a
57:28 victim of it and you can make big
57:31 changes sometimes it feels like it's too
57:33 late usually isn't but sometimes you
57:35 can't rush the fix right you just have
57:38 to be consistent have patience and maybe
57:45 it works itself out you know sometimes
57:48 we have bad apples all over the place
57:50 all over the place we don't want to
57:53 create witch hunts our job would be to
57:57 one paralyze the problem to start
58:02 engaging our kids start talking to them
58:03 get into their day realize that even
58:06 though their children to them their
58:08 problems are just as big as your
58:09 problems I've said this recently another
58:11 episode okay we don't always have to
58:17 Lynch about Apple it just depends on how
58:21 invested they are in their deeds we know
58:24 politicians that are walking around
58:25 right now our ex politicians heads of
58:29 state heads of agencies that are super
58:32 bad apples and are engaging in extremely
58:34 I want I don't want to say nefarious but
58:38 I just did but you know evil [ __ ] and
58:40 they're committed to that until their
58:42 last days and perhaps those are the
58:44 folks that go off to Gitmo I think there
58:48 are plenty but aren't like that they're
58:51 just lost they need alternatives to what
58:55 they're doing and sometimes it could be
58:57 a hug sometimes it could be a phone call
58:59 you know I was you know just thinking
59:02 about you man I didn't want to send some
59:03 [ __ ] text through Facebook I just
59:06 wanted to to see how you're doing make
59:11 the difference in the world they're just
59:12 like oh my god you know thanks for
59:15 calling oh yeah life is weird you know
59:18 it if you know they're in a bad place
59:21 maybe the phone call isn't about what
59:22 are you doing right now so they have to
59:23 kind of dodge bullets like well maybe
59:25 they just got out of jail in probation
59:27 and they don't want to talk about it so
59:28 you just focus on something that's just
59:32 basic talk about your past maybe you had
59:35 when things were good be a distraction
59:38 in a good way
59:39 enable them to remember when things were
59:42 better that's what they need to be
59:44 focusing anyway right I just think there
59:48 are mechanisms to undo bad apples that
59:49 aren't completely destroyed they can
59:51 heal themselves turn back into a good
59:54 apple right I think you feel me
59:59 it's just dawned on me the other day
60:02 because I feel like we have a lot of
60:07 stuff to clean up and a lot of different
60:08 angles to come at it from right yeah I'm
60:14 into deep thoughts radio Calm please go
60:16 there's audio video locked Facebook
60:18 group and a patreon page take care of
60:22 yourself and someone else and I'll see
60:23 you in the next deep thoughts
