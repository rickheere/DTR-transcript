00:02 [Music]
00:23 you
00:24 [Music]
00:34 good afternoon ladies and gentlemen
00:36 welcome back to deep dots this is a nice
00:40 so I'm like a bunch of crackling noise
00:42 here like the old lady at the movie
00:45 theater
00:46 I know lady I don't know next time we'll
00:49 be an old man
00:51 usually it's both of them together it's
00:54 early Saturday afternoon here fairly
00:58 decent weather I'd say 67 70s somewhere
01:01 in there
01:01 but it's gonna drop like an anvil here
01:04 in about two hours so I'm enjoying the
01:06 sweet spot of the day as you can tell we
01:10 are going to discuss well maybe we can
01:14 I'm not sure exactly how I'm gonna title
01:16 this maybe I should keep it clear and
01:20 just say is this heaven pretty sure it's
01:23 not but I think we should analyze
01:26 something because I think it has a
01:28 profound effect on who we are as humans
01:32 it sort of relates to my promise series
01:34 you know the alien promised the Flat
01:36 Earth the promise which is that we we
01:39 sort of look for these moments of relief
01:44 the salvation moments well it sucks
01:49 right now but it's gonna get better in
01:52 the future
01:52 solid just tolerate this and eventually
01:55 it'll be okay I want to open up open up
01:59 the episode with just the notion that I
02:01 definitely think there's two hemispheres
02:04 to quote a bad you geometric metaphor to
02:10 reality due to the fact that this mortal
02:13 coil seems to be born and then obviously
02:17 it goes through various stages and ends
02:22 but we have all kinds of evidence that
02:26 people continue to exist the sort of the
02:29 soul continues to exist I mean there's
02:32 just too much evidence to overlook it
02:35 now for those that control this world
02:37 they don't want you to think that
02:39 because they're in control of you and
02:41 the more that you buy into the limited
02:43 paradigms of which they've gained
02:45 control over then you're completely a
02:47 serf
02:48 a slave to their system right now within
02:54 certain concepts of thought we do
02:57 believe that we are still controlled
03:00 when we are here let's say you buy into
03:02 a soul in the afterlife and God and
03:04 angels and whatever then you wake up
03:07 every day and you know taxes you wake up
03:09 every day and you got to pay money which
03:11 is a result of calorie energy invested
03:13 in a job rewarded a monetary units that
03:17 then you have to give up to eat sleep
03:19 and have some fun so you kind of sit
03:22 there and go well you know you know I
03:24 don't have access to heaven right now
03:26 guys so I'm gonna live in this world and
03:28 in this world I'm a slave sometimes it's
03:32 interesting to pretend to be something
03:36 different in order to understand the
03:38 possibilities of actually being
03:40 different I said it specifically that
03:43 way with a brutal haiku so you'll think
03:48 about it this way what if I came up to
03:52 any one of you and you're in a fairly
03:54 decent stage in life meaning you feel
03:58 comfortable with yourself whatever age
04:00 you are whatever level of maturity you
04:02 are you're good and you could be in a
04:06 dire situation in fact this might have
04:08 more impact if you feel like you're in
04:09 the wrong job and wrong position in life
04:12 but I come up to you and I give you two
04:14 blessings I make you immortal which
04:19 means you cannot be hurt Mack truck hits
04:23 you you're just like the thing in the
04:25 Marvel movies it just wraps around you -
04:29 you have no need to eat or excrete
04:33 you can but you don't have to yeah we
04:37 haven't had the ice cream truck in an
04:38 episode for a while give it all the kids
04:42 diabetes mm-hmm it's a mind-fucking song
04:47 isn't it so I make you immortal and I
04:50 remove your need to consume what
04:53 benefits do you get there
04:55 well let's overlook the fact that you're
04:58 concerned now that you're gonna outlive
04:59 all your relatives and your kids and all
05:01 that stuff
05:01 let's put that aside for a second let's
05:04 just say you're a single person single
05:06 female single male y'all right you knew
05:09 you were going to have all your
05:10 relatives pass before you because
05:12 they're older than you so you're good
05:13 but now you can do whatever you want you
05:17 will never be hungry as far as sleep I
05:21 don't know let's say you don't even have
05:22 to do that you can jump out of a plane
05:25 while it's going yeah you'll just splash
05:27 on the water down below hit the earth
05:29 and you get up brush yourself off you'd
05:32 be alright be like Wolverine right you
05:34 can get shot and nothing happens
05:37 I don't know if it sinks India you pick
05:40 right but now what advantage do you have
05:43 being immortal there's a great Twilight
05:47 Zone that's about this phenomenon where
05:49 a guy is a hypochondriac total [ __ ]
05:53 lives in some apartment in New York with
05:55 his wife and he has over the doctor back
05:58 in the days when the doctors would make
05:59 house calls and he is so sure he's all
06:03 [ __ ] up and he the doctors like one of
06:05 my healthiest patients you know this is
06:07 all psychosomatic he goes you would tell
06:10 me that because you want me to die you
06:11 want me to suffer and he's like oh my
06:13 god you know so it takes he goes talks
06:15 to the wife out in the front room he's
06:17 like in here your husband's really
06:18 healthy this is all in his head here's a
06:21 prescription she goes oh I don't know if
06:24 he'll take these pills and he go no
06:26 these are for you it helped ease the
06:29 nerves of dealing with this [ __ ] so
06:31 doctor leaves he's chastising his wife
06:34 because he's a hypochondriac and what do
06:36 you know the devil shows up in his room
06:38 the devil character I think was in a
06:41 couple episodes but he's absolutely a
06:43 fantastic actor big chunky guy and he
06:47 coerces this guy into selling his salt
06:49 now the guy's not stupid he knows he's
06:51 selling his soul he knows this is the
06:53 devil he's like you know I want to be
06:56 immoral again there's a couple a couple
06:59 Twilight zones where this is the case
07:00 deals with the devil but immediately
07:05 what I always say would happen is that
07:08 you get tired of yourself you get tired
07:11 of life you get tired of now this guy
07:13 was obviously extremely
07:14 short-sighted in this episode he didn't
07:16 become he didn't go after you know
07:19 something in the arts or the sciences he
07:21 didn't try to become a better person he
07:23 just tried to nickel-and-dime his life
07:25 but regardless of how much you're
07:28 willing to participate in your
07:29 immortality there would be this point I
07:32 think where you would get tired of all
07:35 of your thoughts you would get tired of
07:38 well people dying around you for one
07:40 thing
07:40 but even if everyone lived you know the
07:42 Q continuum which I always reference in
07:44 I guess the first three seasons pretty
07:46 heavily trying not to do it so much in
07:48 season four we get to a point where you
07:54 need to renew you do right so when I ask
08:01 you is this heaven
08:04 what do I mean well again I can't vouch
08:09 for the world after this one when we die
08:14 and our soul moves on I'm not sure again
08:20 got some pretty good indicators got some
08:22 pretty good people come up to me or dead
08:24 and talk to me I know it sounds nuts you
08:27 know if uses your first episode in here
08:30 you might want to go see the episode on
08:32 afterlife if you want to hear that story
08:33 in great detail that's the one I know
08:37 it's it's in there it's in a bunch of
08:38 episodes as you guys know so I'm just
08:40 try not to bore you guys to death you've
08:41 gone back to uh or you continue watching
08:43 and you've seen all the episodes but
08:47 there appears to be an ecosystem of
08:49 being alive in a human body which is a
08:52 very finite structure and then going on
08:55 to something that is completely free of
08:57 any tangible instrumentalities as they
09:02 would say in Forbidden Planet 1956 but
09:06 there seems to be a recycling of
09:08 reincarnation phase again kids come into
09:13 this world sometimes way beyond their
09:17 years completely articulate before three
09:20 years old and then some that are dumb as
09:24 a bag of [ __ ] hammers for the rest of
09:25 their life unbelievable
09:27 and it doesn't seem to have any
09:29 association with the family line
09:31 right so you have like a family of gum
09:33 bees you know and they'll pop out a
09:35 genius and you got a family of geniuses
09:38 that pop out of Gumby you know gonna be
09:40 the nice Monty Python reference for
09:42 those of you who need to know it's the
09:45 age of the soul that seems to be
09:46 different now whether or not a soul or
09:49 we get to say hey I want to
09:52 intentionally go into this time frame
09:54 and I want to be born into a family just
09:56 like this I don't know Shirley MacLaine
10:01 Warren Beatty's older sister she started
10:05 a new age movement or at least joined a
10:07 New Age movement and used her popularity
10:09 to produce it in the 80s
10:11 and it was very interesting because when
10:15 I first heard it I was sort of you know
10:17 like a brand-new Christian and at 18
10:20 years old but even before that I think
10:23 I'd heard of it and it just seemed like
10:24 I hadn't hadn't had any thoughts in this
10:26 area of my life she had and obviously a
10:29 bunch of people that followed her had
10:31 these thoughts which is the following as
10:33 I understand it okay but she says that
10:36 if you're poor you've chosen to be poor
10:39 and if you are rich you have chosen to
10:41 be rich if your life is easy you've
10:43 chosen to be on a lower level of
10:44 difficulty if you're choosing if your
10:46 life is really difficult you've chosen
10:48 that for yourself what does she mean
10:51 well as I understand it and and at first
10:55 I thought she was crazy and now it
10:57 almost seems like a logical Epiphany of
11:01 reincarnation and again for the
11:03 Christians that just want to slam the
11:06 book shut go ahead and slam it shut go
11:08 ahead and push stop if it's really
11:09 bothering you because I don't want to
11:11 offend you we're way beyond and this
11:14 show basic religious and basic man
11:18 controlling man apparatus right the
11:21 paradigms that need to be flushed down
11:23 the toilet so if you want to go on to
11:26 the next level of thinking hang on and
11:28 we're gonna have some fun right
11:29 hopefully but once you start
11:33 contemplating infinity and especially
11:35 again Gene Roddenberry's invention of
11:38 the cue character the Q continuum from
11:41 from next generation episode one in 1987
11:45 with jean-luc Picard and the team this
11:48 character didn't exist in the original
11:50 script because he was supposed to have a
11:52 one-hour pilot and I believe it's CBS
11:55 came to him and said we need to our
11:56 opening pilot it's not two exact hours
11:59 about 45 minutes per hour combines about
12:01 an hour and a half with advertising
12:02 consuming the other half-hour but he
12:06 refused and refused and refused and
12:09 finally they cornered him and they said
12:10 you know we're not airing this show with
12:11 that to our intro and he's like alright
12:14 so he takes the script this woman wrote
12:16 that he loved he thought she was the
12:18 number one pick and obviously she did a
12:20 great job as well her name escapes me he
12:23 sat down and wrote the cue character and
12:25 wrapped up the entire next generation
12:29 series with this character him testing
12:32 mankind to say I don't know if you're
12:34 worthy of being a part of this universe
12:37 because you seem to always gravitate to
12:39 war sort of that later down the line
12:42 Fifth Element psyche it's it's an old
12:45 theme in film writing but as that
12:50 character continued they loved the
12:51 character and the actor that played the
12:53 role and so he continued to mature the
12:56 storyline all the way up into Voyager I
12:59 can't remember if he was in enterprise
13:02 it's just a brilliant character played
13:05 by a brilliant actor and like most
13:08 things in the early Star Trek's before
13:10 JJ Abrams started burning babies and the
13:15 Star Trek franchise this was amazing but
13:19 it really got you to think about
13:21 infinity and thinking about whoa okay so
13:24 you get your dream you get to live
13:25 forever
13:26 you're visited by God and God says you
13:28 know don't worry man you you live
13:29 forever I can't stop you from living
13:31 this is just the way it is technically
13:34 speaking were a part of each other I
13:37 have my own version of consciousness you
13:38 have yours and so does everyone else
13:40 maybe God says there's only one of us
13:43 and I'm just playing you in an earlier
13:45 stage right now and I am the last one
13:48 you know I mean how horrifying is that
13:50 right but Shirley MacLaine's
13:54 movement is sort of where I organically
13:59 got myself when starting to really
14:01 contemplate reincarnation because you
14:05 get to these points where there's just
14:07 logic gates that start to turning and
14:09 you start going well you know this world
14:12 changes so if we all live forever but we
14:15 can also procreate that we're gonna have
14:17 too many people on the planet really
14:18 really fast so we need to die because we
14:21 have a limited amount of real estate
14:22 wherever the hell we are right there's a
14:25 drinking game someone's going to start
14:26 where I say the word planet I'm gonna
14:29 hate to contribute to your liver
14:30 exploding but you know what I mean
14:34 limited amount of real estate but we can
14:36 procreate alright that's not gonna ever
14:40 work so we have to die in this form I
14:44 can die is something I don't want anyone
14:46 of you to think as a true it's basically
14:50 like a true finality about to finish my
14:52 sins
14:52 we are butterflies that come out of
14:55 worms and the butterfly goes off to be
14:57 perhaps another worm again maybe some
15:00 cycle I don't know if a fen and Infinity
15:03 truly exists in the physical form my
15:06 brain can not can really conceive of
15:08 that my brain actually can only
15:11 theoretically conceive of the
15:13 mind-numbing concept that numbers go up
15:14 forever they go negative forever and
15:17 they're divisible forever right
15:19 remember bitcoin was sold to you because
15:22 it had a fixed number of bitcoins any
15:25 one of them out there but then when they
15:26 added divisible fractional ownership
15:29 they then screwed it up with an infinite
15:31 infinite supply it's no longer any
15:34 better than just a fiat currency so
15:37 don't believe the hype until someone
15:38 locks when illnesses no no no there's no
15:41 infinity model on our currency why they
15:46 haven't decided to do like a fixed
15:47 amount of currency for everyone who
15:49 joins a currency I don't know
15:51 right say there's tens out 10,000
15:55 bitcoins created for every human being
15:57 that joins the Bitcoin ecosystem and if
16:01 someone stops trading in it you reduce
16:04 it by ten thousand you know something
16:05 like that it's really strange anyway
16:06 back to you Shirley
16:07 clean so you're on the other side your
16:10 soul I'm I'm really hoping okay that we
16:15 have a tremendous amount of
16:16 accessibility to information on the
16:18 other side does be a bummer to have all
16:20 these you knows where dinosaurs a bunch
16:22 of [ __ ] is Erik to be right you know
16:24 I like to have that answer I think I
16:27 have the answer now but you know be nice
16:28 to just have it definitively there right
16:31 but now you would be in a different
16:34 state of mind and I'm gonna give you an
16:37 analogy I was given about God
16:40 probably in 1990 and it was the
16:44 following when we're trying to conceive
16:47 of God viewing time and viewing us from
16:51 his vantage point and again I say he
16:54 just felt a lack of a better gender
16:56 right I think - my youth minister was
17:01 copying someone else's story but he said
17:03 envision a train car like a train and
17:07 let's just say for the sake of
17:08 simplicity has five cars on him that
17:12 River represents five decades of life
17:14 and you're gonna get into the car
17:15 eventually here when you stop at the
17:17 next station and go into your 60s so
17:18 don't think this is like somebody's only
17:20 lived in 50 years but you are a
17:22 passenger on the train when you're
17:25 standing there you're looking straight
17:26 ahead at the next door on the other car
17:29 and it takes you ten years to get to the
17:31 door to go into the next car okay God is
17:39 looking down on the cars with no tops on
17:42 them so guy can see the whole thing at
17:45 once so time for God in this analogy is
17:48 instantaneous and a hundred percent
17:50 whatever God would focus on is where his
17:53 eyes are going and he can pay attention
17:54 to something that you need he can look
17:56 ahead to protect you he can look back
17:59 and enjoy whatever you've done to make
18:02 yourself interesting right now who knows
18:05 how much of your life you keep in terms
18:07 of your recognition on the other side
18:11 again you know Walt Disney hanging out
18:14 at Disneyland
18:16 the only park he ever participated in
18:17 building says volumes for me
18:21 personally you know there's this whole
18:24 thing with the the movie poltergeist
18:25 which I think is extremely interesting
18:27 this notion that you have essentially
18:30 the ability to stay on earth after your
18:34 body passes it's like maybe it's an
18:38 option maybe there aren't hard rules you
18:41 pass and you're sitting there looking
18:42 around like all those movies where you
18:45 know people don't see you anymore but
18:46 you're there but some of us with open
18:49 minds and long hair I don't know what it
18:50 is we have the antennae and they come up
18:53 to you and go you know pop brewer's over
18:54 there once you go say hi that changes
18:56 things because that's a very specific
18:58 thing isn't it it's someone staying in
19:02 their previous identity as a human being
19:05 even though they're obviously no longer
19:08 human being now they're no longer human
19:12 being in physical form but they may be a
19:14 human being in Soul form and spiritual
19:16 form maybe there's not a big difference
19:18 between us as Souls and us as human
19:20 beings god I hope so there may be that's
19:25 silly thinking again it's just to
19:29 briefly digress into an example here any
19:33 of you you play video games and you play
19:35 a game for a long time it's really hard
19:36 but then you download cheat codes and
19:38 you get into god mode and now you can
19:40 slaughter everything instantaneously
19:43 it's fun for about 10 to 15 minutes and
19:46 then you tend to never need to play the
19:49 game again because you've just had it
19:51 completely at your fingertips so my
19:54 concern is that life may need to protect
19:58 itself from ever reaching that God level
20:01 because if you were to be a spirit
20:04 whether you be in human form or a
20:06 free-flowing soul form and you get to
20:09 the point where there's like I've done
20:11 it all right the Q continuum you've done
20:14 at all you've had every conversation but
20:15 in every nook and cranny in the universe
20:17 there is nothing that's a mystery you've
20:20 even dabbled in creation yourself you
20:23 don't get bored of the options that you
20:26 have available right be like living in a
20:29 town where the movie theater has one
20:30 movie there's one restaurant that serves
20:32 one meal you know I'm saying right
20:35 and you know maybe it doesn't drive you
20:36 crazy if you not known multiple choices
20:38 maybe that's just some droney existence
20:41 it's okay relative to your previous
20:43 knowledge right but now if you're a
20:47 spirit and this is an ecosystem by which
20:50 you know you're sort of like you're
20:52 popping out of your body and how he's
20:54 vision you know it's like and this is
20:56 based on some information I got from a
20:59 friend of mine in Ireland she was
21:01 telling me she takes care of hospice
21:04 places and she said when someone dies he
21:07 should there's two things that always
21:08 happened in hospice she goes the room
21:10 will smell like really clean plastic
21:12 just instantaneously but you think when
21:15 a body passes away it loses bodily
21:18 functions clean plastic could be last
21:20 smell you'd get she says everybody talks
21:22 about it she said to a lot of us get the
21:26 sense that the family of the person is
21:28 in the room instantaneously even workers
21:31 that are atheist to get this feeling and
21:35 so when you're in a community of people
21:39 that are constantly dealing with the
21:40 transformation of human soul held down
21:44 by the mortal coil and then being freed
21:46 and then these other folks arriving it's
21:49 it's very enchanting on several levels
21:52 it speaks to an ecosystem right well
21:55 we're gonna go down and watch grandpa
21:57 we're gonna you know greet grandpas soon
21:59 as he passes or whatever and again I
22:02 think this happens under all
22:03 circumstances so you know if there's
22:05 some tragic sudden death or something
22:07 it's probably extra like this right and
22:10 they're bits of fake videos online
22:12 people using special effects to insert
22:17 visions of people after deaths have
22:20 occurred
22:20 I would I would stick with your personal
22:24 witness eyewitness situations and your
22:27 friends that you can trust right but
22:31 your past and these folks are there it's
22:36 probably customed to your personal
22:38 desires right if you wanted to meet your
22:40 family probably meet your family if you
22:42 don't really know your family but you
22:44 have a bunch of heroes who have passed
22:46 maybe they greet you you know
22:48 favorite musician hurt whatever some
22:50 scientist or something maybe your old
22:52 buddies you know and I'm sure that you
22:56 have the option to wait for them as well
22:58 the other big question which is related
23:02 to the train analogy is when you pass
23:06 you know time is definitely in reality a
23:12 true illusion as a as a I would say
23:17 something tangible but it is something
23:20 that we conceptualize because we do know
23:22 that things change States I was a lot
23:26 smaller when I was a baby and I'm going
23:27 to be a shrink 'old up old dude at some
23:30 point hopefully when I pass away okay
23:33 this show has a beginning middle int you
23:36 get me when we go into the other realm
23:38 it's hard to conceive if you really need
23:41 to tangibly hold it in your mind right
23:44 but it might just be as simple as this I
23:46 simply tell you oh yeah when you get to
23:49 the other side really you know we don't
23:51 have any concept of time yeah you could
23:54 sit around and nitpick your existence
23:56 and say well I was talking to this
23:58 person in the morning as a soul and then
24:01 I talk to that soul person second but
24:04 there's no clocks there's no day and
24:05 there's no night you know I don't know
24:08 if what I'm saying is actually true but
24:10 it's less tangible because there's less
24:13 instrumentalities right this reality
24:15 that we have and so if you're not
24:18 looking at the earth and maybe there's a
24:21 lot of other places as well I don't know
24:23 let's just stick with where we are and
24:25 you see time you see the beginning of
24:29 man or however that occurred divine
24:32 creation divine creation with some UFO
24:35 you know splicing in there whatever you
24:38 might find an era that is very
24:41 interesting and to you personally go ala
24:43 but I think I'd like to do this let me
24:44 just get sort of a middle America
24:46 mom-and-pop I don't want to be stuck
24:49 there you know you know terrified to
24:51 travel so let's make sure they have a
24:54 reason to move around you know let's
24:56 look at their lives somewhere we think
24:57 it's going to go I want to be their kid
24:59 don't care if I'm a boy or girl
25:01 let that be random maybe if they want a
25:05 boy we'll just go ahead and do that
25:06 maybe it's out of your control
25:08 but you insert yourself in time and
25:11 there's just a general algorithm that
25:13 you can run that says this is probably
25:15 gonna be about this stuff you could live
25:18 your life one way like if I stayed in my
25:20 hometown I don't know exactly what I
25:23 would be doing but I might have stayed
25:26 on level four
25:28 yeah with the economy bouncing up and
25:31 down hell maybe it's 11 I don't know but
25:33 what I did end up doing by moving from a
25:35 very secure home town to the to the west
25:39 coast at 17 I barely need any money in
25:43 my pocket it was very tough at times
25:46 right the sacrifices I made from a
25:51 normal life for this life are massive
25:53 and they're permanent you know I've lost
25:56 opportunities that my friends had that
25:59 they took advantage of but they look at
26:02 me and they're like wow I would have
26:03 loved to live some of that life and I'm
26:05 looking at their life going I wish I'd
26:06 live theirs right but the shirt Lee
26:08 McClane idea remember she follows to
26:11 have her ideas looking down I do believe
26:14 that there's some sensibility to the
26:17 notion that we could pick where we start
26:20 our lives now I know what some of you
26:24 might be thinking well that makes no
26:26 goddamn sense at all because of one
26:28 specific reason children are born into
26:31 absolutely horrid conditions some people
26:35 become the son of Sam
26:36 they start abusing animals because
26:39 they're beaten by their parents
26:40 neglected by their parents whatever they
26:42 got some bad genes because mom and dad
26:44 were drinking the night that they were
26:46 conceiving who knows right who would
26:51 ever pick that hmm well what's
26:55 interesting about some of the fictional
26:57 takes on this especially the twilight
27:00 zone
27:01 it helps talking about the gentleman
27:03 that was a hypochondriac who sold his
27:05 soul to the devil in some twist of fate
27:09 here he was trying to get well nobody
27:12 constantly was saying he was sick
27:15 his the very next time you see him after
27:18 he sells his soul he's at a subway and
27:20 he stand next to a bunch of people and
27:23 as soon as the train comes by he throws
27:25 himself in front of the train trying to
27:28 kill himself but he knows he's immortal
27:29 and so happens as it tears up his suit
27:32 and then he collects from the insurance
27:33 agency who comes to his house and the
27:36 insurance agents are literally lined up
27:38 in the hallway all paying off near-death
27:41 experiences because he keeps doing crazy
27:43 [ __ ]
27:44 well eventually he gets to a point where
27:47 he's bored to death of life because he
27:49 can only conceive of in this sort of
27:52 limited intellectual you know spectrum
27:55 of this fictional character he can't
27:57 conceive of again learning how to play
27:59 piano all the stuff that Bill Murray did
28:01 in Groundhog Day which I think would be
28:03 your bare minimum but even if you do
28:05 that you couldn't reach a point where
28:07 you're bored to death of at least what
28:09 you can do on this planet you're gonna
28:12 need to travel the Stars or figure out
28:13 what all that is out there to probably
28:15 have a new paradigm of existence that's
28:17 entertaining right there was another
28:20 character and Hitchhiker's Guide to the
28:23 galaxy in the last two books who was an
28:26 immortal and Douglas Adams thought it
28:29 through the writer and he's created a
28:32 character that travelled the universe
28:35 and insulted every being in the universe
28:39 in alphabetical order and so he
28:43 eventually finds our main character
28:45 Arthur Dent and insults him he just
28:49 lands in a spaceship comes out insults
28:51 them so the reason why I give you these
28:53 examples is very specific you would be
28:57 mr. nice guy eating your ice cream and
28:59 all this other stuff up to a point and
29:01 then you'll become the bad guy there's a
29:04 lot of video games out there where they
29:07 give you a choice and again I always
29:10 lean on the ones that I play fallout 4
29:13 by Bethesda which I think released and
29:17 was a 2015 you have three different
29:20 scenarios at the end of the game it's a
29:21 really long game it's a huge world and
29:24 usually if you talk to someone who's
29:26 still playing it to this day
29:28 they all have the same story well I
29:31 handed it you know in those three
29:32 different scenarios I could see what was
29:34 going on then I got bored and I killed
29:37 everybody in the game now the game
29:39 actually keeps some key characters alive
29:41 all you could do is shoot them and they
29:42 kind of kneeled down and you can
29:44 continue shooting them but they'll never
29:45 die and then they heal up and your buddy
29:47 next time you come through town but we
29:50 see human beings doing this all the time
29:53 going after the dark side well why do
29:57 that because they're bored men they're
30:03 bored so why does the slum Dogz of India
30:06 exist why don't why would anyone want to
30:10 be born a Haitian child that the Clinton
30:13 Foundation comes and kidnaps and sells
30:16 you into some organ harvesting thing or
30:18 some sex trafficking thing because
30:22 they're bored
30:22 believe it or not now the other more
30:26 matrix version of this which I'm going
30:27 to stay away from in this episode but I
30:29 want to acknowledge it is my version of
30:31 the NPC prior to the most romantic
30:35 version of the NPC which is your sort of
30:37 your media puppets and your Paulette
30:39 political puppets my NPC version is this
30:43 is sort of like a West world where we
30:45 don't have the outside human area and
30:48 the inside Android area we have it all
30:50 mixed together and I'm not saying
30:53 anyone's androids I'm just saying their
30:55 biological puppets to create the
30:58 fictional tension that the Greek gods
31:01 used to do and the proverbial Clash of
31:04 the Titans Stadium you know you just put
31:07 little pawns down there and and you're
31:10 real and then they introduce a bunch of
31:13 fictional monsters and characters to
31:15 create tension in your life so you have
31:17 some reward mechanism right so you're
31:19 like oh that was hard but then I I
31:21 succeeded you might be competing against
31:24 another full living soul bound symbiotic
31:30 human or you might just be dealing with
31:32 an AI who knows right but now what's the
31:36 point of the episode is this heaven
31:39 hmmm does it sound like I've really
31:41 addressed the question well I've hinted
31:46 at this in other episodes and I want to
31:53 put it like a super-duper fine point on
31:55 it which is what if everything I've said
31:58 is the way that it is and what does that
32:01 mean I just realize you can see the
32:03 camera on me if you know as a human
32:09 being that this is a temporary finite
32:11 life you're born you live in you die
32:13 that maybe you get to 130 if you're some
32:17 super lucky person living up in the
32:19 hills and you have no challenges in life
32:21 but help maybe you die as a young kid of
32:24 some you know GMO cancer but you enter
32:28 back into the the beautiful green room
32:32 of life which is where your soul goes
32:35 hey you created by your family in fact
32:37 you may even meet family you never knew
32:39 you had you know so you're up there and
32:42 as soon as you cross over into that room
32:45 the memories that you didn't have access
32:46 to as a human being because of this
32:49 constraint of this mortal coil right it
32:52 all comes back to you maybe you have a
32:54 different name and the other world
32:57 alright so you're chilling out and you
32:59 pick where you're gonna go we're going
33:01 to your spider a human you're on planet
33:03 Earth planet xenon whatever and let's
33:06 say you could retain that knowledge
33:08 you're gonna come back and you're gonna
33:09 remember oh yeah you know one of the
33:13 reasons well I think I'm starting to
33:16 suspect one of the reasons why children
33:18 cry so much when they are born is that
33:23 they potentially remember the blissful
33:26 nature of where they came from and yeah
33:30 they're they're interested in this
33:31 universe I don't really know if all the
33:35 assumptions about a child's ability to
33:37 see clearly here clearly that sort of
33:40 thing is an issue but we know they can't
33:42 walk they can't hold their head up
33:44 initially they can't communicate
33:48 effectively they're getting hungry
33:50 they're getting tired and it must be an
33:53 extreme
33:53 frustrating thing the more you have a
33:57 grasp of where you were could be that if
34:02 your soul is new which again I'm not
34:05 sure we're souls we come from if that's
34:06 the case it could simply be a lack of
34:09 experience that makes you knew you're
34:10 infinitely old but you never been a
34:12 human before you've been digging on
34:14 being in sex for a while right but you
34:17 come into this world you shake off all
34:19 of the knowledge that you have all the
34:21 blissful answers that you have and you
34:23 might even just wake up every day and
34:25 you just continually realize that you're
34:28 forgetting who you are as a baby and
34:31 eventually you forget so much that you
34:34 accept who you are because that's all
34:36 you can remember is being a human being
34:38 now what's my name again
34:40 oh yeah that's my name and the name
34:42 sucks Wow where do I live again well at
34:46 least that's good you know but what if
34:50 you could keep it full lucidity and
34:52 again we think there's people little
34:54 kids that have kept their their
34:56 faculties for whatever reason they're
34:58 well within their kind of five to twelve
35:01 realm and they're telling their parents
35:03 look I used to live over there that's my
35:05 my old village over there there go yeah
35:07 and they take the kid over there and the
35:09 kids like yeah that's so so so and so
35:12 stone so that's my father ba ba ba you
35:13 know ask him they lost their kid and
35:15 they they ask the people in the village
35:17 and they're like yeah you mean that soon
35:19 oh my god you know there's a real famous
35:22 one from Mexico when I was a kid and the
35:25 most recent one I've mentioned was a kid
35:27 in England sometimes they get a bunch
35:29 right and sometimes they get more than
35:33 you would get if you hadn't been telling
35:35 the truth to some regard likes forty to
35:38 sixty percent it's pretty damn accurate
35:39 when it comes to saying I've never left
35:42 this house because I'm a child and I'm
35:45 telling you that on the coast there's a
35:47 big red you know light house with the
35:49 red house and there's a you know there's
35:52 a basement that has a pool table in it
35:53 and there's two girls three boys
35:55 indebted ah they may not remember the
35:57 names properly
35:58 maybe they hybrid the neighbor with the
36:01 family or something like this but
36:02 they're pretty damn accurate but if
36:04 that's it
36:05 think about it
36:07 do you go through some form of symbiotic
36:10 relationship of the physical being in
36:11 this ether based universe you live a
36:15 finite life your soul it doesn't have
36:19 any relationship in terms of its
36:21 dependency and strategic resources to
36:23 exist with anything this universe
36:25 actually provides to be physical quote
36:29 unquote
36:29 right but through the brainstem and the
36:32 pineal gland it attaches to this life
36:35 force feeds it gives it consciousness
36:37 you can have this temporary run because
36:41 in this world things have a beginning
36:43 middle and end it's what you need
36:46 because if you knew everything you would
36:50 need to not know everything right that's
36:53 the whole thing about being reincarnated
36:55 I think we need to reset as I've said in
36:58 several shows my question is let's
37:01 contemplate for a second we don't forget
37:06 we just keep coming back like Groundhog
37:10 Day or especially the twilight zone that
37:13 Groundhog Day was based on where a guy
37:14 wakes up in a court and he's being
37:17 sentenced to the electric chair but
37:21 everyone in the room reshuffles so the
37:25 judge one day is his death row inmate
37:28 buddy on the next day is his attorney on
37:32 the next day he just keeps waking up as
37:36 soon as he's burned up an electric chair
37:38 he wakes up in the defendants chair then
37:43 he's sentenced again and he just laughs
37:45 and he's trying to short-circuit that
37:46 thing he wants the the nightmare to end
37:49 how would we change our lives if we knew
37:53 this was the way it works that's the
37:55 point of the episode I think human
37:59 beings wait around for something to
38:01 happen
38:01 but then again I think that human beings
38:03 think that we have this ultimate goal
38:06 maybe we don't right maybe there is no
38:10 ultimate goal maybe it's just be alive
38:13 have an experience learn something new
38:15 and with every single variable that's
38:18 going on in this universe what
38:19 is like I mean Christ forget universe
38:22 just this plane of existence that we are
38:25 in think about the infinite variables a
38:30 piano only technically has 12 notes it's
38:33 spread out into several octaves there's
38:35 only really 12 notes well it served us
38:39 pretty good at the record industry and
38:42 trivial producers will cannibalize other
38:46 songs and make it feel like there
38:48 actually is a huge problem with the
38:50 limitation of notes but when you follow
38:52 a true master musician like a prince or
38:55 someone or a Mozart you're you start to
38:58 understand that there are ways to get
39:00 around the reuse of old music well we
39:04 don't have 12 notes in this plane of
39:07 existence we have trillions upon
39:10 trillions upon quadrillions times each
39:13 other squared of options you were born
39:18 into a physical place you born into a
39:20 different body with different parents
39:22 different food supplies different
39:24 technologies you live in you know a
39:27 place where it's hard to live or you
39:29 live in a place it's easy to live you
39:31 have the intelligence to get a job in
39:34 the you know boomer bus cycle that
39:36 global banks allow you to have it's just
39:40 tons and tons and tons and one life you
39:42 feel totally loved in another life you
39:44 don't feel that loved at all and you
39:46 know you're born without a family that
39:48 you can relate to and then you make your
39:50 own family because you marry and you
39:51 have some kids I don't need the previous
39:54 weirdos that took care of me when I was
39:56 a kid I made my own family right and we
39:59 we live according to our standards
40:02 whatever that is right I talked to a
40:06 brilliant guy at my smoke lounge a
40:09 couple days ago and just a treat he is a
40:15 real-estate economist and in Orange
40:18 County California for those of you don't
40:20 know we're we're a wild bizarre prime
40:24 market area of the world everyone wants
40:28 to live here all the time
40:29 no matter where you're from in the world
40:31 they buy houses here
40:33 and so we are insulated in the
40:35 real-estate market from a lot of the
40:37 economic vacillations that the world
40:42 bank's push on us right but he you're
40:47 gonna get a kick out of this for those
40:48 of you who have seen all the episodes
40:51 because I just gave this example this
40:54 real-life example of a friend of mine in
40:56 the San Francisco area when I was really
40:59 like South Bay Palo Alto area but I'm
41:02 working at this pharmaceutical company I
41:04 got this buddy he's probably about 20
41:07 years older than me but he invites me
41:11 over to dinner cuz he and I were just
41:12 chumming around constantly even though
41:14 you know lunch like five days a week
41:15 together and he's like you should come
41:17 meet my wife and we'll eat some dinner
41:19 and I did and and he explained to me at
41:21 the dinner table because he's lived in
41:22 this teeny tiny apartment with most
41:24 nothing in it and I was like wow your
41:27 chick is really cool they live in a
41:28 place with nothing here and he goes well
41:30 what we do is we save up for a year and
41:32 a half to two years and we go to these
41:35 crazy islands and the Pacific where all
41:38 we do is fish we sell some of the fish
41:41 to the market we take the fish that we
41:43 need to eat and the day repeats and we
41:46 live there for a couple years at a time
41:48 because you don't really need much money
41:50 to exist I think he was saying it's
41:52 something like $35 a day just to rent
41:55 the place where he lives but he's also
41:56 selling fish so he's offsetting whatever
41:58 savings he brings there but my friend
42:02 told me this analogy goes well happier
42:04 have you heard the fishing story and I
42:08 was like well I don't know you're
42:09 talking about Jesus and the fit no no no
42:10 talk about that he tells me the exact
42:12 same story because the guy that fishes
42:15 was his fictional version of it the guys
42:18 fishing does what my buddy's doing again
42:21 he catches enough for himself and his
42:22 wife and his family or whatever sells
42:24 the rest to the market and he's good to
42:27 the end of the day but this person from
42:30 the Western world comes up to this
42:32 character and says well have you ever
42:34 thought about getting up a little bit
42:35 earlier and fishing a little bit longer
42:37 and then selling more of that fish to
42:40 the market such that you have a little
42:42 bit more money and then maybe you can
42:43 save up that money and buy a boat and
42:45 get a crew and you could just bill
42:47 empire of fishing in this area now what
42:50 is the guy selling him so even this
42:53 [ __ ] paradigm of work work work work
42:55 work it's the disease of mankind right
42:59 now and so I looked at this guy and I
43:03 said because we're on the same
43:05 wavelength completely and I said you
43:07 know I just did an episode where I said
43:09 that this guy met into BRR and he talks
43:12 at his uber guys too I said the dudes
43:14 moving back to the jungles of Vietnam
43:15 because he's sick and tired of the bay
43:17 area and he said you know they only made
43:20 $2 to 50 cents a day but they enjoy
43:22 their lives and they get to see their
43:23 family all day long they work together
43:25 and I said I think the world is is under
43:32 the misconception that we're super
43:33 intellectual and that working constantly
43:39 is somehow this big achievement in the
43:43 development of mankind now if your work
43:46 is something that you love you're in the
43:49 right zone right provided you can
43:54 provide for yourself right but most of
43:57 us work for some sort of corporation now
43:59 sometimes you can work corporations
44:01 owned by a single individual that you
44:03 respect it's all good that tends to be
44:07 the ones that I gravitate to in my later
44:09 years if it's not my own but when I said
44:14 this thing about us being sort of a fake
44:18 intellectual he immediately said yeah
44:21 isn't it right and this guy is very very
44:23 successful he sees you know giant real
44:28 estate deals constantly in Orange County
44:29 so he's he's hobnobbing with some folks
44:32 that are moving and shaking as it would
44:35 be to the standards of today right I
44:38 think that if we were to wake up
44:42 tomorrow and realize that this is a
44:46 cyclical thing you reincarnated this is
44:51 what you have access to as a physical
44:54 being again we can't claim to know all
44:58 the details of what it's like to be on
45:00 the other
45:01 I think we have evidence of all kinds of
45:03 things on the other side those have
45:05 taken DMT trips and meet beings made of
45:09 light meeting sort of you know alien
45:13 feeling beings help maybe that's who we
45:16 are wearing on the other side who knows
45:17 right we're trying to survive this world
45:20 with the most the highest sense of
45:24 accomplishment and I think with the
45:26 level of happiness that is whatever we
45:30 feel like makes us happy right you know
45:32 we're all different in our definitions
45:33 of what US you know what food tastes
45:36 good with food tastes bad and what's
45:37 considered a rewarding into the day
45:39 right you know I think that we well one
45:44 I think it's very difficult to do what
45:46 I'm saying till week up the next day and
45:49 go wow this is a cyclical thing and I
45:51 can relax a little bit take a little bit
45:54 of the stress off this whole idea of
45:57 working you know twelve hours a day
45:58 because somehow that makes you a better
45:59 human being well I would say it makes
46:02 you a better human being necessarily
46:03 maybe you've had some issues in the past
46:05 and that is a regiment that shakes those
46:07 six any of the procrastinating anomalies
46:10 out of your life but we live too fast
46:15 which just like Roy batty and Blade
46:18 Runner dr. Tyrell says to him look
46:23 McKenna the burns twice as bright bryant
46:25 burns half as long and roy you have
46:27 burned so very bright haven't you and so
46:33 you know again i give those little
46:35 hometown analogies right about what it's
46:38 like to be in a small town and the
46:40 beautiful nature of moving slower it is
46:43 instantaneously recognizable when i go
46:46 back to my hometown in case you're
46:48 wondering it like it look did you go on
46:50 about your hometown a lot why don't you
46:51 just move back shut up already right the
46:55 what ends up happening when you live
46:56 thirty years in one place like i've
46:58 lived here in fact i've lived at this
47:00 particular location longer that i've
47:03 lived any other place in my entire life
47:04 because I've always been forced to be a
47:06 little transient right I now have family
47:11 friends here that if I move back to the
47:13 Midwest
47:14 I won't be able to it'll be difficult to
47:17 come and see them and it would be rare
47:19 and I'd rather be in their lives at the
47:22 drop of a dime I can go just drive to
47:24 their house hey there's an event tonight
47:26 there's an award ceremony or there's a
47:28 movie to premiere I'd rather have that
47:30 close-knit Fame with the friends that I
47:33 have here now if they move on in life
47:35 they pass away or they move on in life
47:39 or what have you then maybe I would
47:41 consider such a thing but again the
47:43 resources that I need to live my life
47:45 are here the challenge well is for some
47:49 of you that live in these nice slower
47:51 communities whether it be in Europe or
47:53 wherever you are in the world America I
47:57 envy the fact that you can live this
47:59 more balanced calm life you can go earn
48:02 your your money the inequality of money
48:06 that is created by the bankers doesn't
48:08 get a hold of you meaning the father can
48:10 go and earn one paycheck and pay for
48:13 everything the family needs you know the
48:15 big scam was you know in the 70s this
48:18 inflation of our money happens so
48:21 quickly that the value of the dollar
48:23 went down and that's why the females had
48:25 to go work because it simply started to
48:26 crumble but we didn't understand thing
48:28 about economics so we let it happen to
48:30 us right but when you live in the big
48:32 city or by a big metropolitan area I
48:36 think you know right away the second you
48:39 get in your car and you get stuck in
48:40 jammed traffic and you look at the rat
48:42 race well maybe we have sold ourselves a
48:46 bag of [ __ ] right maybe this isn't
48:48 really worth going home and bragging
48:52 about right which I think the bragging
48:55 thing ends about the age of 30 right you
48:58 realize the rat race sucks and you want
49:00 out of the rat race right but the other
49:02 big thing that comes with this notion of
49:04 is this it you know this is heaven
49:07 meaning there is none is how we treat
49:13 each other I think you know one of the
49:17 biggest epiphanies that I think would
49:18 shock the entire universe would be if
49:21 all of us learned that there's only one
49:24 of us so when you mean to someone else
49:26 and you feel bad about it because you
49:28 act
49:28 to Ramin to yourself if time isn't a
49:31 constraint for the soul then there is no
49:36 birth of a soul it's just we're seeing
49:40 ourselves at different stages because
49:42 time technically speaking in any sense
49:46 of its definition is infinitely
49:47 divisible like the number set
49:49 well there's infinite levels of us
49:52 growing but even if there is a huge
49:59 number of souls in this universe whether
50:02 it be infinite or a lot whether there's
50:05 a machine that cranks them out
50:07 God's like you know pulling a little bit
50:08 off guard himself off and just thrown it
50:10 into the universe whether that's the
50:12 case it would probably relate to the
50:16 afterlife as to how we would treat each
50:19 other in this life I gave an analogy
50:23 even of ten episodes ago about being in
50:25 traffic in Los Angeles and the fact that
50:27 you could flip the bird at somebody
50:30 perfectly someone who doesn't have
50:32 tattoos all over their face and as a
50:34 seasoned citizen of a big city you know
50:37 you'll never see him again
50:39 so go ahead be a jerk because you'll
50:42 never see anyone again in your mind as a
50:44 human being that's what you think and
50:46 then you flip to the other side you
50:48 realize oh my god I have access to
50:50 everyone at the same exact time what is
50:53 hell well help would be how did you
50:55 treat people when you were a human being
50:56 in this particular cycle of your
50:58 infinite Q continuum life do you need to
51:01 say you're sorry to a few folks I
51:04 definitely would especially just my my
51:09 critique of other human beings while I'm
51:11 driving
51:11 they have no idea I'm critiquing them
51:12 but I cast aspersions on their ability
51:16 to drive sometimes like we all do it
51:18 right but if we understood that we're
51:21 gonna see everyone after this world
51:22 would there ever be a serial killer
51:25 would there ever be some sort of crazy
51:28 leader the current commits genocide what
51:32 a warlord be so easily bought off if you
51:36 said okay we're going to give you and
51:37 yours three generations of a tremendous
51:40 amount of money and hey as long as you
51:42 can educate
51:42 kids with that money they might be able
51:45 to hang on to it for 30 generations but
51:48 don't hold your breath your kids will be
51:49 stupid if everything's given to them
51:52 right but we're gonna give you this
51:54 money and you're gonna go over to the
51:56 tribe next to you you guys are 99.9%
51:59 carry the nine almost infinitely exactly
52:02 genetically the same but I've
52:03 indoctrinated you to believe that
52:04 they're stupid and you're smart or it's
52:07 just simply the price you have to pay in
52:09 order to get this short term burst in
52:11 your life but the human being that
52:15 you're talking to this warlord wherever
52:18 they are
52:18 Afghanistan Africa wherever some
52:21 gangster in America and they look at you
52:23 and they go go [ __ ] yourself what I'm
52:29 gonna I'm gonna do this on your behalf
52:31 as some mercenary for your [ __ ] bank
52:33 or [ __ ] and then when I go to the other
52:35 side I'm the one staring all these
52:37 people in the face and even though
52:41 you're the one that paid me I was the
52:43 guy that compromised my sensibility of
52:45 right and wrong so I could get a
52:47 short-term gain for this tiny little
52:49 journey now a fundamentalist might
52:52 simply say yeah but what matters
52:56 maybe they chose that difficult path
52:58 maybe they chose to be murdered by the
53:00 tribe that murdered them take the
53:02 Shirley MacLaine thing and push it to
53:04 the max right that's sort of what she
53:05 says so is anyone accountable for
53:08 anything we would need information from
53:11 the other side and to really I guess to
53:15 really have a sensibility of the do's
53:18 and don'ts but now here's the thing the
53:21 notion of right or wrong is and I sort
53:27 of have an episode that are very proud
53:28 of called good and evil which you should
53:30 go listen to if you dig this kind of
53:32 conversation I think it's back in season
53:35 one can't remember it's a very
53:38 fascinating biological thing that's
53:41 happening and you know potentially it's
53:43 all soul driven I don't know again when
53:46 the agents Asians say you know how's
53:49 your gut feel about the decision you're
53:51 going to make I think that's a reference
53:54 to the soul more it is than a reference
53:55 to
53:56 the body why does that feeling occur you
54:02 ever think about that
54:03 what good and bad really I mean good and
54:08 bad you might be able to boil down in a
54:10 really remedial understanding that would
54:13 say to you oh it is based on your
54:15 personal gain or loss you know I get
54:20 this if I do this and I'm greedy and I'm
54:22 a human being and I'm feral and that's
54:24 why I have a sense of right and wrong
54:26 but I think everyone who listens to this
54:29 show and I think most of the beings on
54:31 in the universe they reach a point where
54:37 right and wrong is the definition of new
54:40 ones it is the definition of nuance
54:44 isn't it hurting someone's feelings well
54:50 the only reason why you would be
54:51 concerned about hurting someone's
54:53 feelings is that you empathetically
54:54 understand what it's like for your
54:55 feelings to be hurt if you envision
54:59 yourself stealing something out of
55:01 someone's house you go over to your
55:03 friend's friend's house so you don't
55:04 have a really stupid super strong
55:06 connection just yet
55:07 it's your buddy that has the super
55:08 strong connection and you're looking
55:10 around their house I mean there's just
55:11 trinkets everywhere that you would love
55:13 and you take one now you consider taking
55:16 one you realize that that person may
55:20 love that thing and you envision if you
55:25 have a moral base then discovering that
55:27 it's missing and having their heart
55:29 broken even if to you it doesn't make
55:32 any sense I do think that there is an IQ
55:35 rating that is related to your
55:40 sensibility of those things and a lot of
55:42 cases but you can have folks with super
55:44 low IQs that are just good people
55:46 because they can't conceive of being bad
55:48 and then you have your low IQs that
55:50 can't conceive of being good they have
55:52 no sense of right or wrong right when I
55:55 was at Electronic Arts there was a
55:59 famous scenario where these guys at
56:02 Electronic Arts would have like cubes
56:04 with tons of stuff very valuable models
56:08 and things and there was a guy
56:09 there one a the Bay Area award for the
56:12 coolest cube right but the guys would be
56:17 like Star Wars fans and they would have
56:19 all the little Star Wars characters that
56:22 they got out of the 80s and they collect
56:24 them and buy them and stuff would start
56:28 going a start started going missing and
56:31 so at one point one of the guys had his
56:35 little Yoda character stolen it just was
56:38 missing and it just so happened that his
56:41 cube had a camera on it that was part of
56:43 the security system say went to security
56:46 he had the camera roll back and it was
56:49 the cleaning staff right the immigrant
56:51 cleaning staff that came in and we
56:55 watched a mother
56:56 they brought their little kids with them
56:58 right bad combination the kid wanted the
57:02 toy and so the mother without even
57:03 thinking took the Yoda doll and just
57:06 gave it to the kid not realizing that
57:07 things probably two or three hundred
57:10 bucks because it'll make it anymore it's
57:12 limited edition it's got the the better
57:14 of the better thing on his little cloth
57:15 thing on it right that person couldn't
57:19 conceive of the frustration of having an
57:22 item stolen but perhaps they said in
57:25 their brain these are the Habs where
57:27 they have nots we have a socialistic
57:29 mindset and we're going to take from the
57:32 rich and give to the poor don't know
57:35 don't know exactly what was going on
57:36 there but there was no sense of right
57:39 and wrong so there's a point where you
57:41 advance up to a point where you would
57:44 never do that because you understand the
57:46 dimensionality of the crime right this
57:50 is why we have to educate the entire
57:51 world I mean all solutions in this whole
57:54 planet is up to education but now let's
57:58 jump off on education with the the
58:01 realms of which we discussed several
58:02 times on this show all the cerebral
58:05 stuff that's more advanced right you
58:09 know that if you were to go to Harvard
58:12 Yale Princeton Stanford UCLA Berkley
58:17 grab all of their stuff Oxford Cambridge
58:19 you grab all of their academic
58:21 enrollment
58:23 options meaning every class that exists
58:26 at these universities and you lay it all
58:28 out and you take an average conversation
58:30 like the one that we have on this show
58:32 which again for us is an average
58:33 conversation contemplating VAT of which
58:37 is barely discussed in society I'm gonna
58:41 take a guess maybe Berkeley
58:45 maybe Stanford will have these
58:48 existential classes where they get into
58:50 the the deep-rooted possibilities but
58:54 the classes I have actually talked to
58:58 people about attending at various
59:00 bizarre universities that are more
59:02 open-minded and it's a bizarre is a good
59:04 thing the teachers have to write their
59:07 syllabus to the class I've done this
59:09 several times myself
59:10 you have to tell the university what
59:12 you're teaching because they have to
59:14 make sure you're gonna actually give
59:15 some sort of beneficial by-product at
59:17 the end of the at the end of the class
59:19 or lecture or whatever you're doing
59:21 there's usually a paradigm limitation
59:25 because the class has to in the eyes of
59:29 the University it has to come to some
59:31 crescendo of pay off aka value which is
59:36 why you attended the class in the first
59:39 place
59:40 wait think about it you study history
59:42 what sector of history we're gonna study
59:44 we're gonna study the 1900s in America
59:47 okay so you got 1800 to 1899 you're
59:52 gonna know everything that we deemed to
59:54 be significant and relevant to today or
59:56 whatever in those timeframes maybe just
59:59 studied the Civil War for a year but now
60:03 realm we're dealing with unknowns and
60:05 that's very atypical of any academic
60:08 institution right you might say well you
60:14 know dude there's theoretical physics
60:16 classes yes there are now what you are
60:19 studying in theoretical physics class
60:21 are the theories that are now a finite
60:27 postulation by either a single human
60:30 being or group of human beings that
60:33 theorized something out of thin air
60:34 which is fantastic they have studied a
60:37 to a point and you may be invited as a
60:40 student of a class like this to write
60:44 thesis in a particular direction this is
60:47 usually where you get your PhDs but
60:48 think about you got to stay in school
60:50 for you know six years before you can
60:53 even enroll in a PhD level class and so
60:57 what about those first six years you're
60:59 really gonna battle through those first
61:00 six years to just have your mind open
61:02 for the very first time this should be
61:05 taught in grade school in my opinion
61:07 where you have a class that you simply
61:10 prove to the institution and society as
61:14 a whole that you have contemplated a
61:16 particular concept to the point of view
61:20 understanding the theories that exist
61:22 today up to this point regarding what
61:24 you're talking about and then you were
61:26 able to use your intelligence coupled
61:29 with your smartness right the first
61:31 stage would be learning what had been
61:33 done and that's your smartness right
61:34 memorize and repeat stuff then your
61:37 intelligence is going to get involved
61:38 with a causality model of why these
61:41 things are related and you will test it
61:43 out with your intellectual capacity to
61:46 say do I agree you were taught that a
61:50 red shift in stars star light indicates
61:53 that it's going away
61:54 if you see a blue shift it indicates
61:56 it's coming close to you well that's the
61:58 theory right Einstein propagated that
62:02 theory now so that's how we determine
62:03 whether or not the universe is expanding
62:05 or contracting whether something's going
62:07 away at a particular speed it's you know
62:10 quasar in the edge of the universe
62:11 the edge of the perceivable universe
62:14 going you know two times the speed of
62:16 light away from us but nothing supposed
62:18 to be able to hit you know warp 1 hmm
62:22 the reason I mentioned the academic side
62:25 of this discussion is because we is
62:28 because kind of hate saying that is due
62:31 the fact that we need to I think create
62:36 a paradigm sort of a virtual classroom
62:39 in our brains such that when we find a
62:43 like-minded person that is willing to
62:45 have these advanced discussions about
62:46 what could be again not needing a
62:51 tangible breadcrumb trail to something
62:55 that you can hang on to right this
62:57 microphone I can touch it's got
62:58 physicality to it well we can have a lot
63:01 of discussions about the the analog
63:03 signal that comes up to this microphone
63:05 that makes us feel comfortable because
63:08 it really exists in our minds right but
63:11 if I say how do you explain a ghost how
63:14 to explain seeing someone who's recently
63:17 passed talking to you hmm
63:21 and later you find out they've passed
63:22 right you didn't know ahead of time what
63:24 do we do then
63:26 well we're taught I think by those that
63:31 research nothing and know everything the
63:33 classic example of sort of the pining
63:37 pining to be truly human and
63:39 intellectual people on this planet that
63:42 if we can't live in some super tangible
63:46 paradigm of thinking and existence that
63:49 we are the ones that may be in extreme
63:53 forms were chastised but if nothing else
63:55 we're no longer compatible with these
64:00 individuals unless we dumb down out of
64:02 that advanced thinking and I always say
64:05 advanced in 2018 because it is an
64:07 advanced form of thinking to think in
64:09 the intangible on a routine basis you
64:12 still get up put your shoes on you know
64:15 go live your life so you have to be
64:17 living in the tangible realm up to a
64:19 point but I think that most of you who
64:22 listen to these particular episodes and
64:24 you get off on it it's really
64:26 stimulating your brain a lot of the
64:28 comments that come in from time to time
64:30 are oh my god I've been thinking about
64:32 this for a really long time never found
64:34 anyone else that just brazing Lee gets
64:37 out there and talks about it and
64:38 endorses it makes me feel comfortable
64:40 for having these thoughts that I can't
64:44 tell my spouse I can't tell my kids
64:45 can't tell my friends because they'll
64:47 think I'm cuckoo right think about the
64:50 average development of the university
64:55 you know the work comes out of the Greek
64:58 history
65:00 well at some point someone said you know
65:03 what I know some stuff you know some
65:05 stuff he-she whatever they know a bunch
65:08 of stuff and you know we sit around and
65:10 break bread and talk but it's all based
65:14 on our friendships right we only get to
65:15 have the information and have this great
65:17 conversation if we are sharing
65:19 friendships wouldn't it be nice to have
65:22 an arbitrary place we could go where
65:25 regardless if we have a pre-existing
65:27 relationship with each other we can
65:29 enroll and sit down and meet new people
65:31 and get you know lessons on engineering
65:35 mathematics biology whatever and so the
65:39 university is created okay so we've done
65:43 that once it's the method by which we
65:47 educate each other don't forget the the
65:50 little tiny towns in the Midwest when
65:53 they were conquering the United States
65:54 of America god bless the Native
65:57 Americans but even you're struggling
66:00 farmer trying to find a plot of land get
66:04 the the deed to the land they Tillett
66:07 they put the crops down all this other
66:09 stuff you had an era in American history
66:14 where there were no schools because the
66:16 settlers were like I'm gonna teach you
66:18 I'm your mother I'm your father whatever
66:20 typically the moms had the the arduous
66:23 task of raising the kids and educating
66:25 them at the same time but a lot of
66:27 people just learned their trade skill
66:29 kids just grew up and you had a farm
66:31 they learned it from their fathers who
66:33 learned it from their fathers etc etc
66:34 the girls learned how to cook by
66:36 learning it from their mothers and
66:38 mothers and mothers and mothers but
66:39 eventually they had these little farm
66:41 schools sometimes they cannibalize the
66:44 church so five days a week it was a
66:47 school and then two days a week it was a
66:49 religious institution we are now at the
66:53 Great Awakening right well what does
66:56 that mean does it mean watching a bunch
66:58 of conspiracy theory videos or videos
67:00 like this and then trying to remember
67:03 this stuff so when you apply it to your
67:05 life when you wake up in the morning
67:07 you've got some enhanced vision of you
67:11 know
67:12 how to live your life maybe change the
67:14 way you live your life simplify your
67:16 life hopefully and get more out of it
67:20 that's only gonna work for so long we
67:23 are in my opinion in the awakening we
67:26 are without school we are the settlers
67:29 that are simply passing it between each
67:32 other in extremely informal manner and I
67:36 think we need to start the conversation
67:38 about how we can institutionalize these
67:42 moments now there are great institutions
67:46 whether or not you believe in their
67:47 stuff or not there's mufon and you know
67:50 UF ology stuff there are David Ickes
67:53 crowd which go to see him personally for
67:55 whatever he believes and again hopefully
67:58 everyone's taking what they can absorb
68:02 and keeping their mind open to things
68:03 they can't to understand the
68:06 institutions and schools need a booming
68:09 economy because that's what kept the
68:11 settlers from creating these
68:12 institutions right away now the church
68:14 typically there was a band of churches
68:16 that wanted to spread Christianity
68:17 because it's a control apparatus right
68:19 so you know it took a while for the
68:22 Catholic Church to infiltrate America
68:25 and build you know big giant beautiful
68:28 buildings that were called cathedrals or
68:30 whatever churches of Christianity of
68:33 Catholicism excuse me we don't have a
68:37 method of doing this easily right now
68:40 right you know you guys watch videos
68:43 banners show up I got a little bit a few
68:46 pennies and that kind of stuff there's
68:48 patreon pages for various followers but
68:50 it pretty much you know you would need
68:52 he would need millions and millions of
68:54 people contributing to this before
68:56 you're gonna get ancillary cash that
68:57 someone's gonna part with to try and
69:00 formalize this but a physical building
69:03 is old school right we're all online now
69:06 so how did the awakening occur I know
69:10 we're kind of off the track but if you
69:12 dug the first hour of this conversation
69:14 then and you want it to perpetuate and
69:17 mature and you want other people's
69:19 opinions to be involved what do you have
69:21 to do at a minimum you must discuss it
69:25 with someone
69:27 again take the subjects that you're very
69:30 intimately
69:31 I think curious about because you will
69:34 have a lot of unresolved issues in your
69:37 brain like there's folks that when I
69:39 first started the show there were a lot
69:43 of requests from people to talk about
69:45 the afterlife
69:45 I mean requests I am dealing like I get
69:49 these messages i am dealing with a a
69:53 fear of death a fear of the afterlife
69:57 but i also haven't thought about it a
70:00 lot so do you have anything related to
70:03 this subject matter night and i
70:04 eventually made the episode i made a
70:05 series of episodes that i think are
70:07 valuable there have been at least two
70:13 folks that were regular viewers of this
70:17 show and my previous show in kilcher
70:19 radio that eventually said you know what
70:21 i could do this and they made their own
70:23 shows and just fascinating in fact I
70:28 want to give Jed big big props because
70:33 he has a fantastic show it's just GED
70:37 which I believe are his initials but
70:39 he's all over history he lives in
70:41 Scotland and he is just he's really just
70:45 owned his life and made it just was
70:48 already cool to start out with but he's
70:49 really just augmented himself in so many
70:52 ways and he's carrying a whole narrative
70:54 in his realm he's sort of I think a very
70:58 skilled mythbuster that I can actually
71:02 support you know it doesn't matter if
71:05 you agree with him or not he will get
71:06 you to think and that's all we're trying
71:08 to do right right at this point we're
71:10 part of the wakening is to blow the dust
71:12 off the machinery and get the thing to
71:15 to move so I think that one of the
71:18 analogies you could draw from like The
71:19 Wizard of Oz is that when they found the
71:21 Tin Man you could see he had a previous
71:24 life but he was frozen because he had
71:27 rusted and he was saying oil can oil can
71:30 you know and they finally got the old
71:31 cannon spritzed him up a little bit and
71:33 all of a sudden he started moving and
71:35 then all sudden he was alive again but
71:36 then he was in a second tier of his life
71:39 which is to say you know what he wanted
71:43 a heart right or something like that I
71:44 think the lion wanted courage
71:46 the Scarecrow wanted a brain so as we
71:49 wake up we're getting oiled we're
71:52 shaking off this debilitating paradigm
71:55 adoption which is the rust in our system
71:59 right in the next 10 to 20 years
72:04 hopefully there's a change in society if
72:07 we can get these globalists the [ __ ] off
72:09 our backs right
72:10 the problem with globalists is they're
72:12 typically complete [ __ ] sellouts as
72:14 human beings right they'll sell their
72:16 country out they'll sell you out to sell
72:18 your kids out yeah give those kids
72:19 vaccinations let them eat cake right
72:22 full of a bunch of GMO [ __ ] right
72:24 but once we get them to disappear in the
72:27 in the the oligarchy and the aristocrats
72:31 of the world that think they know best
72:34 but they don't have any idea what it's
72:36 like to be you they don't have any idea
72:38 what it's like to struggle like you
72:40 their one-size-fits-all solutions for
72:44 life will eventually boil off and then
72:50 we have to take control well it's not
72:53 like we're gonna get a call or some text
72:55 on our telephone it's all yours guys go
72:58 for it no you're gonna have to do what
73:01 France is doing you're gonna have to
73:02 rebel away from the paradigms that are
73:05 controlling you and communicate with
73:07 each other most likely beforehand and
73:10 we're going to have to formalize somehow
73:15 what we're talking about in these
73:16 episodes so that we can figure out the
73:20 ecosystem of who we are right let me
73:24 close on this idea you have an example
73:26 of the benefit of one of these changes
73:30 if we got what we were looking for some
73:34 eccentric billionaire said you know what
73:36 I dig this I'm gonna put up some money
73:39 I'm gonna take care of your salaries and
73:41 all this I just uh find a little place
73:42 in Orange County California or wherever
73:45 in the world this person is they want to
73:47 contribute
73:49 and go get the people with the knowledge
73:52 go get people that can run experiments
73:54 based on your hypotheses and we said
73:59 okay and they say well what would be
74:01 your first thing that you would go after
74:02 right you know we can toss it up we can
74:06 make divisions right if you want to have
74:08 a zero-point energy system because you
74:09 want to get rid of oil companies you're
74:11 gonna draw a lot of attention and
74:12 they're gonna try to kill everybody off
74:13 it's just gonna happen all right so
74:16 maybe that's a covert little project on
74:18 the side but one of the ones we could do
74:20 related this episode is to figure out
74:23 whether or not we are symbiotic creature
74:25 whether or not we have evidence and I
74:28 think obviously I think we do but how
74:31 will we how would we put it in a bottle
74:36 so to speak such that a person who's
74:38 randomly coming in off the streets could
74:42 see what we have done in terms of
74:45 research and be convinced fairly quickly
74:47 there's something to this right
74:50 Ian if I had this surveillance video
74:52 from it was either end of 2007 I think
74:55 it was in a 2007 a Bing a Disneyland and
75:00 walking from the bank directly to Bob
75:02 Gurr in I guess I don't know if it's
75:06 Tomorrowland or fantasy land the Nemo
75:08 ride just straight to the guy and I had
75:11 that on video that'd be a great piece of
75:14 evidence to say look you see I'm not
75:16 bullshitting you this happened even
75:17 those witnessed by four different or two
75:19 other people besides he and I but who
75:23 knows who knows if there are other folks
75:26 in the world that have already done
75:27 these tests they've already done this
75:29 research and I know there's tons of
75:30 books out there it's only so many hours
75:32 in the day for any one of us to consume
75:33 it all and to report back on it but
75:37 think about it are we even trying I mean
75:42 we know that there are people that are
75:44 devoted to this kind of stuff but we
75:45 also know there's a lot of folks that
75:46 make money off of people because they're
75:49 con artists maybe deep down inside they
75:51 believe this stuff is real but they got
75:53 to make a living and so they they do
75:55 what was Michael J Fox his character did
75:58 in the movie frighteners which is Peter
76:01 Jackson's
76:02 one of Peter Jackson's first films which
76:04 is just brilliant if you haven't seen it
76:05 and what he does is he actually can see
76:08 the dead and he falls around funerals
76:13 and uses agents from the other side to
76:18 to possess a house and then he's the
76:21 Ghostbuster that comes in and cleans out
76:24 the the the ghosts with the ghosts are
76:26 his friends and so he's got a little
76:27 scam going there but he runs into a
76:30 really bad bad dude who's Jake Busey
76:34 playing this character I love Jake Busey
76:37 I wrote a film for Jake hmm
76:40 he doesn't know it but they did but the
76:45 other exciting thing is if you
76:49 understand there's people way smarter
76:50 than you way smarter you may be they're
76:54 not equal to you in every single way but
76:56 they're way smarter in the areas that
76:57 you want to know information the super
76:59 exciting notion is what if you hired
77:01 them with these objectives you need a
77:04 very exhaustive interview process of
77:06 course right but you hire them and you
77:09 give them money and you give them
77:10 resources you make them come up with a
77:11 plan about how they're gonna do it what
77:13 equipment they would use what
77:15 theoretical interviews they might use
77:16 psychology physiology science whatever
77:22 it would be fascinating right to see
77:24 some discoveries in these areas where
77:27 society isn't ready as a whole because
77:29 again they're not ready the internals of
77:33 the body the human body were hidden by
77:35 Christianity for thousands of years they
77:40 said you can't open a human body because
77:43 that's against God
77:44 well the Jewish culture was opening up
77:47 human bodies and the Arabs were opening
77:49 up human bodies and learning how it
77:50 worked and saving lives so we were the
77:53 last ones to the game which is why when
77:55 you study all of your Anatomy none of
77:58 the body parts are in modern English
78:00 right I think in man's religiously
78:05 controlled paradigms and maybe just
78:09 plain old secular shortsightedness we're
78:12 doing the same thing to ourselves in a
78:14 lot of cases not you
78:15 you guys are the hope of the universe
78:17 quite frankly right but I'm hoping and I
78:21 don't get much in the way of you know
78:23 responses in the comments section I do
78:26 when I don't but I mean it's it's a
78:27 single percentile rate of comments and
78:29 maybe you guys are doing it but the idea
78:32 is this are you having conversations
78:36 about this kind of stuff are you talking
78:40 to your loved ones about this kind of
78:42 stuff how are you doing with those
78:44 conversations do you have a friend or a
78:47 spouse or a child that is open to these
78:52 discussions if you're a new parent and
78:54 your kids are starting to talk and
78:56 they're starting to ask that question
78:57 why why why do you take the time to
79:01 explain things to them do you say well
79:04 sit down for a second all right so
79:07 you're gonna go to school you're some
79:09 child who's interested in science and
79:12 you're like they want to know about the
79:13 fundamentals of the universe and you're
79:15 like okay well probably the most
79:17 fundamental concept we should discuss is
79:18 gravity right I know a lot of you guys
79:21 don't think it exists but no how the
79:23 [ __ ] you explain how I'm held to the
79:24 ground that's what I call that stuff but
79:28 you know I taught my daughter the wrong
79:30 theory of gravity when she was 9 years
79:32 old thinking I was teaching her the
79:33 right theory which is mysterious force
79:37 you know it's mysterious property where
79:39 matter can pull against matter like
79:40 there's some exchange of information and
79:43 and material substance between the two
79:47 which is complete [ __ ] see but you
79:50 want it you know your kids gonna go to
79:51 school and learn all of these things
79:52 that are claimed to be figured out right
79:57 you go to a church and they tell you the
79:59 whole [ __ ] thing is figured out God's
80:00 figured out the AFT place figured out
80:02 and they got the whole rulebook of
80:04 what's gonna send you to hell too which
80:05 is really funny right but today if I had
80:08 a newborn asking me the same thing or
80:10 I'm mentoring a little kid and their
80:12 parents are totally cool with this sort
80:14 of conversation I'd say well this is
80:15 what you're going to learn in school and
80:17 you're more than welcome to go down that
80:19 path and try to figure out how you might
80:21 prove that to be true because it hasn't
80:23 been proven it's a phenomenon right
80:25 gravity is a phenomenon but if you study
80:27 you throw models of gravity it's all
80:29 explained
80:29 equal amount of sense that this one does
80:32 in terms of the factors of results you
80:34 put this amount of force in you get this
80:36 sort of thing right I would like to hear
80:39 how you guys are dealing with this on a
80:41 day to day basis because I think it will
80:45 be your successes and failures and my
80:47 own success successes and failures in
80:49 communicating with other human beings
80:50 that will deduce the final I shouldn't
80:57 say final there's no final but some of
80:59 the more productive methods of having
81:02 these conversations with other human
81:03 beings such that we can advance the
81:04 whole thing right the the great
81:06 awakening that's happening right now is
81:08 I think more pointed at human beings
81:12 understanding banking and how banking
81:14 controls politics and how politics
81:16 controls us playing a simple you know
81:19 Wars or a byproduct of those those three
81:23 factors but the spiritual ecosystem of
81:26 us right this idea of whether or not
81:28 this is it this is heaven and he goes in
81:31 this big circle again how many wars
81:34 would you fight how many arguments would
81:36 you have if you saw the full system I
81:39 mean imagine imagine having an argument
81:41 with somebody that you you love but
81:44 you're gonna shoot it out with them and
81:45 you say well in the next life you know
81:48 you can go screw yourself you know or
81:52 you know we're gonna see each other
81:54 after this so why are you being so mean
81:55 you know maybe if you believe there's
81:59 one soul you're like why would you do
82:00 this to yourself
82:01 you know why would you cheat on yourself
82:03 why would you lie to yourself to get
82:05 this little thing this little short-term
82:07 thing in this life well I thought you
82:10 were more into the you know massaging
82:13 your soul up to some super ascended
82:15 level of goodness are you on the the God
82:19 mode right now where you want to just
82:20 shoot everybody up because you've never
82:22 done it before some ludicrous example of
82:26 life but imagine we started dialoguing
82:29 about the daily challenges of life based
82:32 on our belief system that is completely
82:35 different than what we believe it is
82:36 today and hey I might be completely full
82:38 of [ __ ] on everything I've said in this
82:40 episode but you know why it's
82:42 interesting
82:43 because I haven't anyone had haven't had
82:45 anyone talked to me about this kind of
82:46 stuff it's interesting I mean I have
82:49 just I should say this I am extremely
82:52 privileged beyond your input personally
82:54 to have close friends of mine that are
82:57 super open-minded but when I start
83:00 talking about us potentially being a
83:02 symbiotic being between a soul on a body
83:04 and this ecosystem which I've done
83:07 several times and conversations the
83:09 amount of silence that occurs right
83:11 after I pitched that first sort of
83:14 treatment out there
83:16 it's almost unanimous it's staggeringly
83:19 deafening the silence because what is
83:23 going on in my friends brains I think is
83:26 that they've never had the thought
83:27 before and so one I probably sound kooky
83:30 to a bunch of them so like oh Jesus
83:33 where the hell you going man we were
83:34 just watching f1 on television and
83:36 somebody died and we had a conversation
83:38 about you know the families that are
83:41 mourning that death or whatever someone
83:44 might walk in the room and say they lost
83:45 someone right what if you believed that
83:51 we were an ecosystem when you die as a
83:54 human being you go on to this soul based
83:55 world and then you lose someone but you
84:01 ultimately believe in this recycling
84:03 system you've seen the proof we have
84:04 done our due diligence over the next 20
84:06 years
84:07 all right so 2038 we're sitting pretty
84:11 we have maybe some evidence we can show
84:14 people does that make losing a loved one
84:16 any easier of course not you miss what
84:20 they were and you in you if you're going
84:24 to continue living your life it's going
84:26 to be decades and decades and decades
84:27 before you get a chance to go the other
84:29 side yourself and see them again but
84:34 that's the beauty of life isn't it it's
84:36 the beauty of loving each other it's the
84:38 beauty of exactly what we are and I
84:42 think if we were to get to that point of
84:44 realization where we believe in this
84:46 system and then we lose someone and use
84:50 natural causes to right your
84:52 grandparents do pass away at some point
84:53 right
84:55 think of the level of thought and
84:58 maturity you could achieve and the
85:00 pioneering in your brain that can happen
85:03 if instead of thinking oh my god did
85:06 they just turn into ashes and it's over
85:09 but you say no I believe they go on and
85:12 they recycle well there's a bunch of
85:15 different feelings and perceptions and
85:18 advancements probably if you're like me
85:20 in your own consciousness if you believe
85:22 that and then maybe you find solace in
85:26 that you find a lot more peace in that
85:28 or maybe you find a whole closet full of
85:32 emotions that you've been hiding in the
85:35 closet that when you open it up it
85:36 bursts out on you and you get very
85:38 emotional and you have that kubler-ross
85:41 thing right you go into like this anger
85:43 denial like negotiation and acceptance
85:45 and eventually like okay I do believe in
85:49 this afterlife thing because I've had X
85:51 number of experiences or I believe
85:53 people that say they have okay so I got
85:56 to come to terms with this wasn't the
85:59 end of that that being that I loved so
86:01 much right I think you feel me it's a
86:04 long-ass episode my hope with making
86:07 episodes like this is really based on
86:11 giving you personal strength and
86:15 perspective based on your beliefs not
86:17 exactly mine I've given you mine with as
86:20 much sincerity and honesty as I can
86:22 possibly muster with as many examples as
86:25 possible and coming at it from different
86:27 angles
86:27 hopefully representing a bunch of you
86:29 who have different angles because I
86:31 think personally once you have an open
86:33 mind one you'll never get butthurt again
86:36 right if you have an open mind but to
86:41 you know I don't know if you're like me
86:43 but you can get distracted with your
86:46 emotions right happens to everybody
86:49 you're having a great day everything's
86:51 just going great you've maybe got a
86:52 project you got to finish or you're
86:54 working on or you're starting and you've
86:56 had a really good night's sleep you've
86:57 had a good meal everything's great and
86:59 then a text message comes in and some
87:03 bad news may not be bad news directly at
87:06 you but someone is suffering in your
87:07 life
87:08 and you're like oh my god and now you
87:09 can't think clearly it's taking away
87:12 from what you're doing now this is
87:14 something we sacrifice for each other
87:16 and it's an honorable thing I'm not
87:17 saying we shouldn't do that but you'll
87:20 have this thing that happens now a lot
87:22 of times those little things if you're
87:24 like me those things are happening to
87:26 you by by your own thoughts you get in
87:31 some form of contemplation I think that
87:35 once you can develop an acceptable
87:38 open-minded platform of thinking right
87:41 what we have in this world is a
87:43 close-minded platform of thinking when
87:45 we are children we are taught to accept
87:47 paradigm after paradigm after paradigm
87:49 in order to exist I'm hungry what how do
87:53 I get rid of this feeling in my gut here
87:55 have some food boom right wow that works
87:58 great so I'm gonna accept the fact if
88:00 eating it does this and it makes me feel
88:02 better right one of the groups of people
88:06 in this world that I think benefits from
88:10 having a really tough job as our law
88:13 enforcement around the world I'm
88:15 obviously talking about the good guys
88:16 not the couple bad apples and make
88:19 everyone look like [ __ ] when you meet a
88:21 cop that's been on the beat for 10 years
88:25 plus you know obviously a tougher
88:28 neighborhood but even in the a nice
88:30 neighborhood
88:30 there's always something going on some
88:32 domestic violence situation it's based
88:34 on someone's drinking too much or having
88:36 financial problems or all the above and
88:39 these individuals have dealt with it and
88:42 you meet them and then you're sitting
88:45 down in some room discussing your
88:48 problems or yeah whatever someone's kind
88:51 of problems in life and the law
88:54 enforcement person sitting there just
88:55 chill as could be cool as a cucumber and
88:59 why are they cool as a cucumber because
89:02 they're looking at you going I respect
89:04 the fact that you have you have a
89:06 massive emotional response to this thing
89:08 that's bothering you and you know
89:10 sometimes it's big enough that everybody
89:11 can get shocked by it but in a lot of
89:14 cases they're like they just reach over
89:16 and touch you and they're like you're
89:18 alive
89:19 you woke up today isn't that good isn't
89:22 that great
89:23 you know I buried two people last night
89:26 one was a car wreck one dude just died
89:29 in his living room I had to watch people
89:32 mourn of the sudden losses of
89:34 individuals or they put people in jail
89:37 because they're strung out on
89:39 methamphetamine or some you know heroin
89:42 or something and they're watching their
89:44 lives go from productive and and
89:47 rewarding with no limitations about what
89:49 they could do with their lives and now
89:52 they're crawling into this cave where
89:54 they may never escape I lean on people
89:57 like that theoretically right I don't I
90:00 mean I have some friends of mine er in
90:02 law enforcement or were in law
90:03 enforcement but I lean on people like
90:06 that you know the wise souls from my
90:08 hometown you know the farmers or the
90:10 just sort of the cowboys that that have
90:14 had tough lives right when you realize
90:17 you bring you nothing but petty crap and
90:19 they've seen a bunch of heavy-duty stuff
90:22 a soldier coming back from a war they're
90:24 an incredible example of the same thing
90:27 you can learn a lot about your
90:30 priorities when you stimulate yourself
90:34 intellectually to this level of the
90:37 fabric of your existence if you care
90:39 about it right some people don't care
90:40 and they live in bliss and God bless
90:42 them they don't necessarily need to wake
90:44 up
90:44 they'll just be the happy shoe repair
90:47 guy baker or whatever right but if you
90:50 care that means you're still listening
90:53 then I think we need a methodology right
90:56 we need something to give ourselves some
90:59 empirical data as best we can possibly
91:02 share it with each other and it will
91:05 give us more peace and more solace in
91:08 our lives right I always believed in an
91:12 afterlife I don't know what I never
91:17 really felt like it was anything that
91:19 Christianity had ever come up with even
91:21 when I was a Christian it's just sort of
91:23 like that seems boring as hell sitting
91:25 in a sitting a castle with walls and a
91:27 gate right build that wall heaven built
91:30 it okay you have this
91:33 hell and damnation you know pit of fire
91:35 [ __ ] to manipulate me while I'm on
91:38 earth right but I you know I sound like
91:44 a broken record I apologize but the
91:46 second Walt walks up to me and tells me
91:48 to go over there boom no more worries
91:51 about the afterlife whatsoever right I
91:54 mean if anything I'm just kind of like
91:56 oh I hope I haven't done anything wrong
91:58 in this world that will make it
91:59 difficult for me but I doubt it I'm all
92:02 about saying I'm sorry if I offended
92:04 someone to the point I would need to say
92:05 something right but I no longer fear for
92:10 your life either but I know that this is
92:15 a very unique experience that I think
92:16 should be cherished every second year
92:19 live right again like I've said in
92:21 episodes two seasons ago I don't think
92:25 that those that invest in us from the
92:28 other side would be a god by himself or
92:31 God in the spirits that love you your
92:34 family members and all that stuff I
92:36 don't know if they care what we do with
92:40 our lives whether or not I think they
92:41 overall would want us to be happy no
92:43 matter what but I think that they do get
92:46 off on us being extraordinary human
92:48 beings and that does not mean you're
92:51 famous as defined by mankind you can be
92:55 an extraordinary mother and no one knows
92:58 until they meet your kids and your kids
93:01 are just high-quality people again
93:03 anyone who raises great kids is a great
93:06 person doesn't mean if your kids go off
93:09 the beaten path and embarrass you that
93:11 somehow that means that you've done a
93:13 bad job sometimes it just happens okay
93:15 and sometimes they rebound and they come
93:17 back I want to put a little statement
93:21 out then I hope she's watching I can't
93:24 remember the woman's name but she gave
93:26 us a comment in the YouTube channel
93:29 saying that she feared that being a
93:30 stay-home mom meant that she was somehow
93:33 an ordinary person may be less than
93:36 everyone else or something like that I
93:37 think that was the gist of the comment
93:39 now she had resolved the fact that she
93:41 was special but I want to give a huge
93:44 shout out
93:46 to the women that have had will one the
93:49 ability to stay at home and raise your
93:51 kids but also the devotion to do so you
93:56 ladies are the fabric of the universe as
94:00 we know it on earth right now for the
94:02 dads obviously dads have the the brutal
94:06 the brutal world of go out and make the
94:08 money no matter what you can't you can't
94:10 stay at home usually right you have to
94:13 be distant from your kids because you're
94:16 going off and working what have you a
94:17 lot of moms are stuck in that situation
94:19 too so it just doubles the amount of
94:22 alkaloids I think you can give a woman
94:23 who's got to do both sides of the game
94:26 dads are often minimized in this world
94:29 but then again that's why we have really
94:31 thick skin that's why you know we are
94:35 more stoic on average and that's why we
94:38 have I think a lot more distance to
94:40 travel to be empathetic towards the
94:42 universe I hope this episode was
94:45 interesting for you guys
94:47 let's dialogue shall we right for those
94:51 of you who listen to me on podcast and
94:53 rarely ever come to YouTube you don't
94:55 have an account on YouTube but you come
94:57 in and you register an account simply to
94:58 leave a comment i SuperDuper appreciate
95:01 that that means a lot to me if you
95:03 haven't been to deep thoughts radio calm
95:05 please go there's audio and video so if
95:07 you want to change formats take this
95:09 into your car you're more than more than
95:11 welcome a lot of you have that I think
95:13 it's called a YouTube red account where
95:15 you're able to download these into your
95:16 telephone and watch them without using
95:18 your digital minutes on your phone
95:20 definitely don't cost yourself any money
95:22 the podcasts are typically I think about
95:27 50 to 60 Meg when they're compressed
95:30 what I do just for those of you are
95:32 interested the show is obviously being
95:33 recorded in stereo on this mic it has
95:35 left and right sensors in here but in
95:38 order to make it smaller on the podcast
95:41 I mix it in mono which is why my voice
95:45 is in the center of your car or in the
95:47 center of your head if you're wearing a
95:48 headset so I do that simply to make it a
95:50 little bit smaller for you guys there's
95:54 a lock Facebook page it is I think a
95:58 really fun place to be
96:00 we post a lot of funny stuff on there
96:01 that is based on you know so the
96:06 rhetorical ignorance that we've we're
96:08 all in when we believe something that
96:10 was a little silly but it's a it's a
96:12 good community everyone's really
96:14 friendly with each other so if you're on
96:16 Facebook and you're sort of bored to
96:18 death and you want some fun stuff in
96:19 your home feed definitely click the
96:22 Facebook link on deep thoughts radio.com
96:23 and get yourself join to the group
96:26 there's a patreon account for those who
96:28 want to donate on a monthly basis I will
96:31 say that as of 2018 fall so I guess when
96:34 winter excuse me I'm trying to put some
96:37 more behind-the-scenes stuff on there
96:39 and so what I'm doing is about 80% of
96:42 the episodes I'm able to post them the
96:45 second that they go into encoding on my
96:47 interface and so as soon as it comes out
96:50 of encoding the folks on patreon can see
96:53 it early up to three days early before
96:57 it ever gets released to the YouTube
96:59 public feed so it's actually on YouTube
97:01 it's just unlisted but I hope you're
97:04 having a good day
97:04 hope this was healthy let me know what
97:07 you think take care of yourself and
