00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen
00:37 it is uh technically thanksgiving in
00:39 america although it's
00:41 one in the morning i want to put out
00:44 there before we get into this episode
00:46 that i am
00:47 aware that we're going very cerebral
00:50 right now and i will be getting back to
00:54 some more of those fun episodes
00:56 where i pick a really super interesting
00:58 topic and then
01:00 deep dive with lots of pictures and that
01:03 kind of stuff
01:04 but we're kind of in the middle of this
01:08 weird phase
01:12 where we're dealing with a a societal
01:16 tug-of-war and what i'm trying to do is
01:19 equipped us
01:20 with conversation rationale
01:24 thought process so that you can find
01:26 what you believe
01:27 in the midst of all this chaos so as you
01:30 have conversations in the
01:32 near future which i think will be very
01:35 pivotal
01:36 to our future you'll have me
01:40 contributing my little touch points but
01:42 then you'll have
01:43 more importantly your take on things
01:46 again i think it goes without saying
01:50 do your own research come up with your
01:52 own solutions
01:54 make up your own mind again if i see
01:57 anything that frustrates you as i always
01:59 say
02:00 it just means that you're more equipped
02:02 with your own beliefs
02:05 and what a transition that was
02:09 this episode is called poisonous beliefs
02:12 and it is very involved believe it or
02:15 not this isn't going to be
02:16 just talking about things that are very
02:18 harmful that we absorb into our
02:20 character
02:21 but sort of the process the platform
02:24 that needs to be created
02:26 to activate
02:29 that virus in our system
02:33 it's almost like an aab binary weapon
02:37 the belief system poetically is the b
02:41 but a is going to be the architecture
02:44 underneath
02:45 the belief system that activates it
02:48 you're probably going okay what are you
02:49 talking about dude
02:52 well what would be a poisonous belief
02:55 poisonous belief at its fundamental
02:58 definition would be doing harm
03:01 a lot of times the
03:04 poisonous belief harms ourselves we
03:07 believe something is something
03:09 good for us something we should do to
03:11 ourselves or not do to ourselves
03:14 and it ends up in our demise our
03:16 deterioration our
03:18 lack of happiness getting ourselves
03:22 into our own demise as i like to say
03:26 but there's a architecture underneath it
03:29 now i'm one of those old-fashioned guys
03:31 that
03:33 rightfully acknowledges two biological
03:36 genders the key word is biological
03:41 there are only two biological genders
03:44 you might have a bunch of mental genders
03:47 but there's only two biological
03:50 so if i wanted you say i'm a bad nwo guy
03:54 i want you to start fracturing your mind
03:58 because what i really want you to do is
04:00 one be super unhappy but two i don't
04:02 want you to procreate
04:03 i want that to be as difficult as
04:05 possible
04:07 but what i what i've kind of deduced is
04:09 if i can get you to look in the mirror
04:11 and not recognize what you are
04:14 then i gotcha for as long as you
04:17 maintain that
04:19 mental illness to not be able to know
04:22 who you are
04:23 i mean physically know who you are we
04:26 all kind of wonder who we are
04:27 psychologically and spiritually i have
04:30 to teach you
04:32 a new paradigm of thought
04:35 and i have to give you a lots of hooks
04:39 that what i'm teaching you is necessary
04:42 that
04:43 harm is being done where harm is not
04:44 being done
04:47 because do harm again applies
04:50 to from you to yourself from you to
04:53 others
04:54 from others to you and others to others
04:59 there are so many of each one of those
05:02 categories i think i'm just going to go
05:04 through a few
05:06 but we're in the epidemic of
05:11 new belief systems that are completely
05:13 acidic completely poisonous to your
05:15 future
05:15 that are based on perceptions of other
05:18 to other harm
05:20 you were doing something bad to somebody
05:22 else you could be saying
05:24 a word that has been deemed off limits
05:27 you could be addressing someone
05:28 traditionally as we have addressed
05:31 each other for tens of thousands of
05:34 years
05:35 and now all of a sudden that's bad and
05:38 he's mentally ill people
05:40 now if you have a friend that likes to
05:42 be called mr strawberry and you don't
05:44 mind calling him mr strawberry well then
05:46 you just go right ahead
05:48 i'm not talking about that but before we
05:51 get totally into the details let's pull
05:53 back for one second to
05:55 identify an archetype of
05:58 sort of what's going on in our time
06:00 frame right now
06:02 it used to be if there was someone on
06:04 your block
06:06 up in your business they were pretty
06:09 rare
06:10 the old lady that's always looking out
06:11 her window to see when you came home
06:13 from work and and she was cheated on you
06:16 know 30 years ago so
06:18 every time your schedule varies she
06:20 wants to tell your wife that you're
06:22 probably doing what her ex did
06:26 she's a [ __ ] starter as they always say
06:29 and that was rare there was one in uh
06:33 beetle no not beetlejuice edward
06:34 scissorhands
06:36 the religious lady who just thought the
06:39 second coming was around the corner
06:41 everyone's a demon
06:43 and she was a weirdy today
06:47 that archetype is
06:50 trying to become the norm everyone's up
06:53 in your grill
06:54 constantly you gotta wear a mask
06:58 you gotta keep six feet from people
07:00 can't have too many people in your house
07:02 this is the new one
07:04 but before that it was you can't use
07:07 you know just recently and it's still
07:09 overlapping with the one we have now
07:11 sir ma'am boy girl
07:15 mr mrs she he
07:19 all these things are trying to get
07:20 deprecated with the
07:23 new social programming from europe
07:27 and those who are pushing it in europe
07:28 aren't serving the european community
07:30 either
07:31 they're serving the nwo the agenda 21
07:35 slash agenda 2030
07:37 individuals that want to organically
07:39 depopulate the world as much
07:41 much as possible when there's nothing
07:44 that can stop their plan
07:46 or their their scenario
07:50 of having to wipe out the planet in some
07:52 catastrophic
07:53 stroke of something they are never going
07:56 to get
07:58 the world convinced about this lunacy
08:02 in such a way that we will go from 7.5
08:05 billion approaching eight
08:07 down to below 500 million in perpetual
08:10 balance with nature as the
08:12 georgia guidestones say
08:15 so you can most likely vouch that
08:18 regardless of where you live in the
08:19 world
08:20 you are feeling this invasion in your
08:22 life
08:23 your social media if you have any and
08:25 you look at your
08:27 your posts of your feed of everyone
08:29 else's posts
08:30 there's got to be a few people in there
08:32 if not a lot of people in there
08:34 who are trying to tell you how to live
08:35 your life you will get phone calls from
08:38 long term
08:38 long long-lost friends and they'll make
08:42 little salutations to you and ask you
08:44 how you're doing but before the call is
08:45 over
08:46 they're engaging in your business
08:50 your absolute private business
08:53 what's interesting is is that these
08:55 recent four years have revealed a
08:57 tremendous amount of bad behavior and
08:59 humanity
09:00 at the upper upper level of
09:04 control royal families engaging in
09:07 pedophilia
09:08 celebrities and bankers engaging in
09:10 pedophilia human trafficking all these
09:12 different things but those same people
09:14 that are so worried about you wearing a
09:16 device over your face
09:17 which does nothing more than give you
09:19 brain damage
09:21 does not protect you against what
09:22 they've been told that it protects you
09:24 against
09:26 they don't care about those other things
09:27 at all in fact a lot of my friends
09:30 who are in that camp are pooh-poohing
09:34 that that ever
09:34 happens in the world doesn't matter how
09:37 many pedo circuits are busted
09:39 doesn't matter how much evidence we have
09:43 they don't want to believe it so that is
09:46 a
09:47 a poisonous belief they won't allow
09:49 inside their system
09:51 which would actually save lives
09:54 rescue children rescue women that are
09:57 being
09:58 trafficked around the world as unpaid
10:02 slavery prostitutes
10:06 i don't know about you but when i think
10:08 about my past
10:09 all the way back to my first memories of
10:11 being alive
10:14 because i am here now my past
10:17 does sort of feel like a dream
10:20 and it feels like a dream on many levels
10:22 one because i don't
10:24 think the human mind is capable of fully
10:26 reconstructing
10:27 like brainstorm the movie every single
10:30 sense you had you know like you might
10:32 remember very vividly something that
10:33 happened to you when you were four
10:35 but we don't have the ability to smell
10:37 the room
10:39 to roll our hands through the carpet i
10:41 mean we have a memory of maybe how
10:43 it felt on a dopamine level but we don't
10:45 have a feeling of what it really feels
10:47 like on the
10:48 underside of our hand as well
10:51 because every decade gets worse and
10:54 worse and worse
10:55 you go back and you realize the world
10:57 was a better place we weren't so
11:00 mean we weren't so worried about being
11:02 so hard all the time
11:05 and gosh darn it a boy was a boy and a
11:07 girl was a girl
11:09 no one was talking about this other
11:10 stuff and you can like each other
11:11 however you want to like each other
11:13 boy boy girl girl one guy likes both one
11:16 guy likes to dress
11:17 like a girl i mean whatever you're still
11:19 acknowledging two biological genders
11:22 which is something i want you to repeat
11:24 so that's why i repeat it
11:27 so without the foundation steps
11:30 the societal pressures which we're going
11:33 to get to
11:34 how those get to us because this is how
11:36 you can take control of your life
11:38 on a level that's like i don't know it's
11:41 almost like you were obese and no one
11:43 ever told you that sugar
11:46 is partially responsible for that eating
11:48 lots of fatty things
11:49 is partially responsible for that not
11:52 exercising might be
11:53 might be a way that you would rather get
11:55 rid of the weight
11:57 the movie branded of which i've probably
11:59 mentioned three times in five years
12:02 is an epic example of
12:05 how they make decisions to destroy the
12:07 world
12:08 it's part of the plot of the film and
12:10 within
12:12 15-20 minutes you'll see the scenes i'm
12:14 talking about i'm pretty sure
12:17 but it was filmed in russia it was very
12:19 interesting it's got
12:20 some famous american actors
12:23 lead guy does a great job it's a great
12:25 film it's indie
12:27 but it's really well made it's all about
12:30 a guy who was in charge
12:32 of pr marketing
12:36 and
12:39 in combination on a back room there was
12:42 uh there was a reveal of the guy who
12:45 played the priest from
12:47 exorcist one the guy that was dressed to
12:51 look old
12:51 who in this movie actually is old like
12:54 he was in the movie dreamscape as well
12:56 he's been in a bunch of stuff
12:57 but anyway he goes to a boardroom and
13:00 tells all these ceos of various
13:03 fast food companies that we're now going
13:06 to sell
13:06 fat anyone who got a problem
13:10 with that and they just all sat there
13:12 like drones and shook their head
13:13 and then all of a sudden there were
13:15 commercials on tv or incredibly obese
13:18 people were
13:19 the center stage individuals
13:24 okay that is
13:29 an exaggerated version of exactly what
13:32 happens to us
13:34 because all of our press all of our
13:38 media in general from magazines to
13:41 websites okay everything that's printed
13:44 the books and all your famous bookstores
13:46 if it's not in the new age
13:48 section or someone published it
13:49 themselves
13:51 it's being controlled by a conglomerate
13:53 of editors
13:54 who have marching orders
13:58 and marching orders can come two
13:59 different ways marching orders can be
14:01 very specific where you involve the
14:03 editor in the conspiracy to to
14:06 essentially perform autonomously
14:10 you know you say this is what we're
14:11 trying to do make sure everything goes
14:12 that direction
14:13 yes sir poof they do that but then
14:16 there's an indirect method
14:17 which is also very popular which is you
14:20 keep
14:21 the people who are making the giant
14:23 decisions of the world off-site
14:25 because everything's electronic now here
14:27 comes a book manuscript
14:29 it's a touchy subject well make sure you
14:31 send it to headquarters in europe
14:33 some dude the united states is like okay
14:36 sends it off and they just make edits to
14:38 the book and they give you any excuse
14:41 necessary as an editor in america as a
14:43 sub editor
14:44 that person just wants to get the book
14:46 on the shelf to make more money and get
14:47 to the next book
14:48 they're not going to sit there and
14:49 question the ethics of the changes
14:52 and so things get modified
14:55 what are the other methods they get to
14:57 us to program
14:58 us television and film television which
15:02 is now largely through the internet
15:04 so just always count that into
15:06 everything i'm saying
15:08 but they'll start creating emotional
15:12 connections to these narratives
15:16 remember the show breaking bad for those
15:19 of you didn't see it
15:20 it's very simple the bad guy was the
15:22 good guy the good guy was the bad guy
15:24 they reversed the polarity of what you
15:26 should be thinking
15:28 and when the good guy would suddenly
15:30 start catching the bad guy
15:32 which was the brother-in-law it was a
15:35 sheriff or a cop or something
15:36 and you wish that guy to fail so that
15:39 the bad guy could keep going
15:41 because all the humor and all the turns
15:43 and all that breaking bad
15:45 uh theme where if you haven't seen the
15:48 show it's like
15:49 something will be going bad and then
15:51 they actually turn it
15:53 one step more negative
15:56 the negation of the negation as they say
15:59 in writing school
16:01 so you're when you see things like that
16:04 you're getting
16:05 emotional payoffs dopamine payoffs in
16:09 your mind
16:10 for sort of like pulling the old handle
16:12 on the old
16:13 one arm bandit lots of dopamine
16:16 traveling in your brain because what
16:17 happens with that
16:18 you might win if the three registers or
16:20 more come up
16:22 with whatever you're looking for
16:24 cherries whatever
16:27 well they can set you up with enough
16:31 you know narration indicators that you
16:34 know oh my gosh this is gonna happen
16:35 it's like a guy ritchie movie right
16:37 guy richie writes some of the greatest
16:39 collisions of characters
16:41 in movie history he literally collides
16:44 them together
16:45 sometimes but you're like oh [ __ ] he's
16:48 gonna that's gonna find that person that
16:50 body and he did that thing wrong and
16:52 then poof something extra bad happens
16:56 and you're getting a dopamine rush
16:59 whatever's going on during a dopamine
17:02 rush
17:04 is what your body wants you to continue
17:06 repeating
17:08 there's very instinctual things about
17:09 how the human body is programmed
17:12 let's just say your body is a
17:16 just a machine that's entertaining your
17:18 soul
17:20 and it's still instinctual it still
17:21 needs to learn because perhaps when we
17:23 were first here we didn't have
17:25 uh you know the internet and iphones and
17:27 that kind of thing so we're roaming
17:29 around planes we're finding new animals
17:31 new creatures
17:32 new insects new fruits and vegetables
17:34 whatever
17:37 and we try things and if they work out
17:40 you eat something and it feels makes you
17:42 feel good it makes you no longer feel
17:44 hungry
17:45 it gave you some energy maybe it gave
17:47 you a hallucination when you kind of
17:49 needed one
17:50 whatever maybe you just felt victorious
17:53 because
17:54 you swung a bone and you knocked out a
17:57 bore
17:58 and then you killed it and then you ate
18:00 it and everyone else ate it and my gosh
18:02 you're now responsible for feeding the
18:03 whole village
18:04 you're you're cherished all these great
18:07 things everything positive that occurs
18:09 in your life is a dopamine drop
18:12 and that is where your mind will start
18:15 to say okay whatever you just did
18:16 keep doing it which is why when we do
18:20 things
18:20 that are called bad habits that
18:22 manufacture
18:24 dopamine which is anytime you are happy
18:27 with the payoff
18:29 you are going to be encouraged by your
18:31 subconscious
18:33 to do it again if not your consciousness
18:37 now your consciousness is something you
18:39 can obviously
18:41 listen to in your mind you know i
18:43 shouldn't be doing this but i'm gonna do
18:44 it anyway
18:45 that's your consciousness your
18:47 subconsciousness is
18:49 hey you're just sitting on your sofa and
18:50 i got bored right now what should i do
18:52 in your subconscious like
18:54 remember that thing we did let's do that
18:55 again
18:59 how do you think serial killers become
19:01 serial killers
19:03 engaging in heinous events
19:07 because for whatever reason
19:10 probably because they were abused when
19:12 they were young they were the victim
19:14 and when they kill someone else now
19:16 they're not the victim anymore
19:18 that is all they really care about
19:21 now if they're doing something else to
19:22 get the rocks off well then you just
19:24 keep compounding
19:25 the payoff and they'll go back for more
19:30 and they don't care about anybody else
19:32 it's not about anyone else it's about
19:34 them
19:36 everything has a foundation
19:39 which is why when you want to get
19:40 control of your mind
19:42 you've got to go back and take inventory
19:44 of what you think you've learned over
19:46 time
19:48 i used to say you know 400 episodes ago
19:52 one of the things you have to do is take
19:54 everything that you think you believe
19:57 and just like a hoarder show put it on
19:59 the front lawn
20:00 you're going to make three piles
20:04 things do you believe things you don't
20:06 believe
20:08 and the stuff you're still deciding and
20:10 typically that center pile is the much
20:12 bigger pile
20:13 where you're evaluating what you believe
20:16 but now inside your house which is a
20:18 representation of your mind
20:21 you're going to build a pantry
20:24 so the shelves on the left is what you
20:26 believe set of shelves on the right is
20:28 what you don't believe
20:29 and in the center is a
20:33 a little chopping block area a table
20:36 where all the things are that you're
20:38 going to be evaluating
20:40 one way or the other one of the reasons
20:43 why i
20:44 you know routinely mentioned
20:48 certain things that i know that
20:50 aggravate some people and it's
20:51 absolutely not to aggravate anyone
20:54 is to try and reduce the aggravation
20:58 for instance some of you believe the
21:00 world is flat some of you believe the
21:02 world is round
21:04 we really really really
21:07 need to make sure that as we engage what
21:10 we believe
21:11 that we're not trying to take a crap on
21:13 other people
21:15 who believe the opposite thing
21:18 i don't know anyone who's believed flat
21:20 earth their entire life
21:23 so if that's true i think that's true
21:28 then you were once a globe person as
21:30 well and you just simply
21:32 saw some things that made you believe
21:35 that there's no indication there's no
21:37 proof
21:38 that it is a globe because nasa says
21:41 that every picture of earth from space
21:43 has to be a composite
21:45 image made from high altitude images
21:52 i understand but look at religions
21:56 no matter how you parse the religion
21:59 within christianity i don't even know
22:01 how many divisions of christianity there
22:03 are
22:03 thousands i assume each one of those
22:06 divisions
22:07 has been taught that their tiny
22:10 interpretation
22:12 is the only way to get to god and
22:14 there's no other way
22:15 you walk across the street to another
22:17 church you were going to hell
22:20 wow that's some hubris right
22:24 we take on these generalities
22:27 that we believe that whatever makes us
22:30 happy makes everyone else happy
22:32 i mean how could it not make them happy
22:35 well very simple have you ever gone to
22:37 dinner with someone who hates the food
22:39 that you wanted to eat the most tonight
22:41 you wanted italian but someone else that
22:44 you're with
22:45 doesn't like italian typically happens
22:47 when you
22:48 either have a large group of friends or
22:50 your associates that you work with or
22:52 hopefully your friends as well
22:54 and someone's like man i just ate
22:57 italian like four days in a row it's not
22:59 that i don't love it but if we could
23:01 not eat that or maybe we could go get
23:03 pizza or it doesn't feel too italiany
23:07 maybe get a barbecue pizza or whatever
23:09 it doesn't not going to taste like
23:10 naples right
23:13 you accept that in instantaneously
23:17 well of course people don't like me but
23:20 in other genres of our mind we
23:22 typically think that everyone else
23:24 should be like us
23:25 even if you're very intellectual and you
23:27 may not ever vocalize that
23:30 but now let's just say your iq is about
23:32 130.
23:35 i'm gonna i'm gonna guess that
23:38 everyone watching this show is about 130
23:40 at a minimum
23:42 minimum it only goes up from there
23:44 especially if you can habitually watch
23:46 this stuff
23:47 and it's you're tolerating me is half
23:50 the iq boost
23:52 but let's just say we take that down 20
23:55 30
23:55 40 points or even lower
24:00 now that perception of everybody wants
24:03 what i want
24:04 and everyone needs to behave the way i
24:06 want to behave
24:08 gets to ludicrous levels
24:12 now imagine let's just take an example
24:14 here a mathematical example
24:17 of how crazy this new age
24:20 transformation is going
24:23 how many people are in the world how
24:26 many people
24:27 of perhaps the largest group would
24:29 consider themselves
24:30 one group of people i guess it'd be
24:33 china about 1.5
24:34 billion india would be 1.2 1.3
24:39 now is there any major similarities
24:40 between china and india
24:42 not really and we like that we like to
24:45 have chinese culture we like to have
24:47 indian culture
24:48 even if china is communistic they've got
24:50 some
24:52 wonderful gifts for the world and so
24:53 does india
24:55 well look at all the other countries i
24:57 mean europe's blowing smoke up their own
24:59 hole
24:59 thinking that you know getting rid of
25:01 all the borders and unifying the
25:03 currency
25:04 is going to make everyone want the same
25:06 thing it's not going to do that at all
25:10 but some kids in america
25:14 very low vibration people
25:17 very susceptible to suggestibility
25:21 they're lost they don't know who they
25:22 are their parents have been torn apart
25:25 by the economy
25:27 perhaps their parents and them have bad
25:29 educations
25:31 and no trade skills whatsoever
25:34 and so they're looking for something
25:35 they're looking for something to give
25:37 them
25:38 some grip in this world like i want to
25:40 be useful to this planet they say to
25:43 themselves
25:45 and here comes an agenda 21
25:48 belief system hey you want to feel
25:51 special
25:52 yeah okay did you know you're not a boy
25:56 what did you know you're not a girl what
25:59 yeah you're neither one of those things
26:01 and you know what the man's been keeping
26:03 you down
26:06 really uh have you ever gone to
26:09 comic-con
26:09 yeah okay what did you wear when you
26:11 were there i wore a furry suit
26:14 well that's what you are you're a furry
26:16 yeah i am
26:18 and the funny thing is is the goal is to
26:21 lock you
26:22 in puberty lock you way back in your
26:26 teens
26:26 so that you never mature up like an
26:28 adult it's the peter pan principle right
26:32 keep you down keep you down inside your
26:33 mind but you can never achieve any of
26:36 your goals because
26:36 maturity is what's required
26:40 so they get these kids strung out on
26:42 these
26:43 utterly fantastical bizarre
26:48 almost like a science fiction movie plus
26:50 a comedy
26:52 plus i don't know brave new world all
26:54 mixed together
26:55 some insane objective to entrance the
26:59 world to change the world
27:02 and these kids always privilege white
27:05 kids
27:05 always if anyone else can get in that
27:07 group they're just emulating privileged
27:09 white kids
27:10 and those are your antifa kids your blm
27:13 kids
27:15 that don't understand life whatsoever
27:19 don't have any history low education
27:23 they just are they've mutilated
27:25 themselves
27:27 and now they've made a mistake and they
27:29 look in the mirror and they're like oh
27:30 man i screwed up
27:32 but some guy's like no you didn't you're
27:34 doing great
27:35 oh really yeah you know that little tiny
27:38 dime-sized
27:39 area of your cheek you didn't tattoo you
27:41 should go get a tattoo there today
27:43 get a pentagram oh yeah that'd be great
27:47 i mean you're already unemployable well
27:48 it's a little more ink you know
27:52 but what they actually believe
27:53 mathematically in their mind
27:56 is they're going to convince every every
27:59 chinese person every indian person every
28:02 russian citizen
28:03 every middle eastern person
28:07 to come on board man because this is so
28:09 good
28:11 they actually want that holy war
28:14 to exist it was a setup
28:18 and it was a spike and a slam
28:21 they were lost and so they're looking
28:24 for anything
28:25 to make wrongs rights and this is their
28:28 own opinion of wrong not my
28:30 opinion of wrong i mean hey man if you
28:33 decorate yourself
28:34 and you put all kinds of crap in your
28:35 head to make yourself look like an
28:37 animal
28:38 and you're good with it i don't care
28:41 you'd be my buddy i don't care
28:44 just don't try to change me
28:47 if i ask you to try to babysit a bad
28:50 habit that you see me doing
28:52 then by all means step in every single
28:54 time i do that bad thing or start ebbing
28:56 towards it
28:58 but we're not giving people permission
29:00 to change the world
29:02 have we done this before
29:05 where acidic belief systems infiltrate
29:08 the children of the world
29:09 the privileged children of the world
29:11 because there's
29:12 really a couple different types of
29:14 privilege but
29:15 one of the definitions which is never
29:17 defined by the press
29:20 is you have way too much money you don't
29:22 need to work either your parents are
29:23 paying your bills
29:24 or for whatever reason you're renting
29:27 that 200
29:28 a month room and you make about a
29:30 thousand dollars a month
29:32 from whatever unemployment or universal
29:34 income
29:35 or the coffee shop if you can open it
29:40 let's say you gotta you got money you
29:41 gotta answer everybody all your bills
29:42 are paid and you know you're just
29:44 wandering around wanting to know
29:46 gee i'd really like to get expensive
29:48 things but i guess i have to wait for
29:49 some rationale
29:51 some architectural rationale to to
29:54 loot and pillage my town
29:59 so i'm going to go back to an era where
30:01 i wasn't
30:02 i was only partially alive during this
30:05 era but
30:06 it's something that i've interviewed my
30:07 buddies about who were
30:09 in the pocket man and that would be the
30:12 hippie movement of the 60s
30:14 now i don't have any knowledge about
30:16 hippie movement outside the united
30:18 states of america
30:19 one of my guys is from the east coast
30:21 one of my guys is from the west coast
30:24 one of my guys was not born inside of
30:26 any religion
30:29 and one of my guys was born mormon into
30:32 the mormon religion and then he pulled
30:34 out of that whole thing and now he's
30:35 pretty agnostic
30:37 okay i asked them about the hippie
30:40 movement
30:41 because it was a wild about face within
30:44 the last hundred years maybe i should
30:47 say 150 years
30:48 of american history because even though
30:52 you know hard times conquering this
30:54 continent was rough
30:55 right and a lot of horrible things
30:58 occurred in doing so
31:00 after things had generally stabilized
31:04 men were hard because that's just what
31:06 the journey had
31:08 in store for them to conquer this place
31:11 and even if you were a son or a grandson
31:14 of the last generation to really fight
31:16 it out you still had new wars that were
31:19 coming online
31:21 and you had very stoic parents because
31:24 no one had any time for emotions
31:26 if you wanted to get emotional you'd be
31:28 very upset
31:30 but what was the movement both my
31:33 buddies came from families with money
31:36 i think one came from family with lots
31:38 of money and one came up
31:39 with pretty good money they were trying
31:41 to convince these kids
31:45 to just deny everything that was
31:47 commercial
31:50 to deny all of the sort of
31:53 nuclear family concepts that we had put
31:56 together
31:56 even though most of them ended up in a
31:58 nuclear family
32:00 that they created by themselves but both
32:03 gentlemen pulled out of the hippie era
32:06 in haste and
32:09 it's not like they had anything
32:11 tremendously bad to say about it but
32:13 they knew
32:14 right away that what they did was they
32:16 pulled out a weird subset of behavior
32:19 from the good
32:20 set of behavior and immediately saw
32:23 that humanity doesn't really work well
32:26 and what's strange is at least one of
32:28 them would probably push the red button
32:30 to convert the world to socialism today
32:34 but i asked him about communes
32:37 because they kept mentioning it i lived
32:38 in a commune once
32:40 and i really only asked the question not
32:42 out of any
32:44 goal to pull something out of them
32:47 that i you know i wasn't trying to fish
32:49 for something or mine something out of
32:51 them but what they both
32:52 said was the same thing in two different
32:54 conversations probably a couple years
32:56 apart from each other to be honest
32:59 and neither one of them even though they
33:00 know each other
33:03 engaged in this activity together
33:06 i'm giving this example because they
33:07 were poisoned with a belief system
33:11 they were given a foundational platform
33:14 of socialism even though it probably
33:16 wasn't called that back in those days
33:18 just called the hippie movement
33:20 and then they practiced it and it failed
33:25 now i think they believe that with
33:26 perhaps the internets
33:28 it'll be better this time hilarious
33:32 if anything the internets should be
33:34 teaching them that brazil
33:36 and venezuela are knee-deep in socialism
33:40 and it is a horrid horrid existence down
33:43 there
33:44 in venezuela you can pay for a full tank
33:47 of gas
33:47 by giving the guy a cookie
33:51 there's i watched the documentary where
33:52 the guy did it and the the american that
33:54 was there was like or
33:55 i guess it was the new zealand guy he
33:57 was like did we just pay with that with
33:59 the cookie he's like yeah
34:00 he says all the gas is free and so these
34:03 guys can't make any money so the only
34:04 thing that they do is they take anything
34:06 you bring them
34:08 it's fantastic but there's gas shortages
34:12 in a country that has plenty of
34:14 all the very tough oil to refine oil
34:18 but both of my buddies said this they
34:20 said they built a commune
34:22 i don't know where i need to figure out
34:24 the locations
34:26 and they all agreed to do a co-op you
34:29 know to work together or someone they're
34:30 all going to work together to clean
34:32 clothes to cook food
34:33 to build fires do whatever they need to
34:35 do continue building the commune itself
34:38 and within a couple weeks only three
34:41 percent
34:42 of everyone involved continued working
34:44 and the other 97 percent
34:47 sat around lazy these kids had never
34:50 worked in their life so it wasn't like
34:52 they were coming off an assembly line
34:53 going man i just need to brag relax just
34:56 give me a couple weeks to kind of
34:58 acclimate and all this other stuff nope
35:00 so one of my buddies said okay this is
35:03 not this is not the way it's supposed to
35:04 be
35:05 he was one of the three percent
35:08 goes off it creates another commune with
35:11 the three percent
35:12 and then anyone else who wanted to join
35:13 them they told them about the previous
35:15 experience they said look if you turn
35:17 into those 97 percenters
35:19 then you're out of here oh yeah i would
35:21 never do that i'm i'm a workaholic blah
35:23 blah blah blah blah blah
35:26 and then it happened again and that's
35:28 when my buddy left it
35:31 my other friend told me a similar story
35:34 he also told me a story the second guy
35:36 told me a story that he thought that
35:39 the communes were crap because what
35:41 would happen is the most pretty people
35:45 would run the place almost overnight the
35:48 good looking guy who could play the
35:49 guitar
35:49 i guess that was a big thing back then
35:51 and then the girls would just fawn over
35:53 him
35:53 and of course best looking guy gets all
35:55 the best looking girls
35:57 thus alienating everybody else
36:01 i thought it was interesting that that
36:02 had probably been 50 years
36:04 well not probably 40 years since
36:08 he actually had physically experienced
36:09 this and it still bothered him to this
36:12 day now back in the 60s we may not have
36:15 understood
36:17 where that idea came from
36:21 now we know that foreign governments
36:24 can do things to you and i mean
36:27 you not just america america could do it
36:30 to you you could do it to america we
36:31 could do it to other people
36:34 and you infect this group that can sit
36:36 around and listen to you
36:38 talk because why because they're
36:41 privileged
36:42 not to have to work or they're so
36:45 incapable of working because perhaps
36:46 they don't have any employable skills
36:49 you can have a skill on monday and as
36:50 soon as it becomes pretty obsolete for
36:52 whatever reason i mean you gotta nut up
36:54 and go find something else you do
36:56 there's always something out there that
36:58 you like to do someone will pay you for
37:00 it
37:01 so the generic thing about belief
37:03 systems is they're typically
37:05 created by the elders of a community to
37:08 accomplish a goal
37:09 they're not just invented out of thin
37:12 air
37:12 they always have a goal christianity's
37:16 main goal was to get rid of what was you
37:18 know
37:19 the reason why there's one god an
37:21 atomistic belief system as opposed to
37:23 the pluralistic system that was there
37:25 before we had idols
37:27 was that you couldn't get everyone on
37:28 the same page if you worshiped
37:30 idols well my god says i don't have to
37:32 do that my guy says i can do this
37:35 so they wanted to muscle it all into an
37:37 atomistic way of belief
37:39 so that they could then hurt us and
37:41 control us
37:43 i once had it told to me and i think
37:45 it's a it might be more of a
37:48 symbolic truth but it makes sense
37:52 that religion allowed families to exist
37:54 religion allowed societies to
37:57 finally put some stakes in the ground
38:00 stay in a location
38:01 work together have some morals so no one
38:03 has to worry about somebody doing
38:05 something bad to someone else
38:06 you don't murder you don't steal you
38:08 don't cheat on your
38:10 wife you don't lust after your buddy's
38:12 wife jesse's girl you know
38:15 that makes sense to me i don't know how
38:17 it actually technically took place and
38:19 who went first
38:20 and second that kind of thing
38:23 as a village would interact with another
38:25 village sometimes it'd be a positive
38:27 experience sometimes be a bad experience
38:31 what is unfortunate is that i think
38:33 instinctually over time
38:35 when you had a group of people that
38:37 looked very different
38:38 than another group of people probably
38:42 more aligned with uh it could be
38:44 physical stature you could have some six
38:46 foot eight people
38:48 they're all six foot plus or more
38:51 interacting with some pygmies that are
38:53 you know three and a half feet uh five
38:54 feet
38:55 and then there's just oh look i can i
38:58 can break this one you know
39:00 but i think unfortunately pigment
39:04 in our skin is probably one of the
39:06 things that
39:07 made us feel extremely different from
39:09 each other
39:10 but as the different groups collided i'm
39:14 sure there were people that reacted
39:16 badly
39:17 and tribal wars started occurring
39:20 and so you built up this
39:23 unfortunate prejudice against
39:27 anything that's different than you
39:29 because it never works out on average
39:32 now what i just talked about could be
39:35 and i think very much is a subliminal
39:38 instinct within the programming
39:40 of the human genome
39:44 now let's just say there's 50 more of
39:46 those
39:48 50 more instinctual touch points in the
39:51 human mind
39:53 that if activated will categorically
39:57 divide
39:57 man and so
40:00 if you are orchestrating an agenda 21
40:03 you're trying to divide and conquer the
40:05 planet
40:06 meaning if america was
40:09 following the constitution if we didn't
40:11 have these scumbag democrat
40:13 governors shutting down their you know
40:16 states and making everyone go bankrupt
40:17 well they go out of vineyards and they
40:19 get their hair did and they do other
40:20 things
40:22 if we were under one party
40:26 just use the constitution man it's
40:28 simple no one's gonna touch anybody if
40:30 that thing is enforced
40:33 okay then we become damn near invincible
40:37 as a country
40:38 you would have to get your nukes over
40:40 here
40:41 to destroy us without us stopping those
40:44 from getting here
40:47 well that's exactly what folks that are
40:49 wanting to control the world
40:52 understand better than we do so
40:55 it's sort of like you know you're in the
40:58 80s
41:00 and you can go to a party no problem
41:03 there's a party down the block
41:04 can you hear it yeah let's go join it
41:06 okay and you go in the 80s and as
41:09 you know as long as you don't have a bad
41:10 reputation in your neighborhood they're
41:11 like oh my god
41:12 you live down the street right yeah amen
41:14 you mind if we join you no problem
41:18 okay so that goes for a long time and
41:20 it's great you invite your neighbors
41:21 over it's wonderful
41:23 and then all of a sudden you get i don't
41:26 know
41:26 some skinheads some prejudice group
41:31 and they're like let's go to that party
41:34 oh oh here's how we're gonna play it you
41:35 act really nice for the first uh
41:38 ten minutes and you keep looking at me
41:40 wherever we are keep looking at me we'll
41:41 spread out
41:42 and then we're just gonna start brawl
41:44 and we're gonna start busting stuff and
41:46 breaking things
41:48 and how's that even possible because
41:51 we're just letting anybody in because we
41:53 trust each other
41:55 we get a few of those going on
41:58 in a neighborhood and you know what's
42:00 going to start happening
42:02 parties are going to be surrounded by
42:05 bouncers
42:06 no one's going to be allowed in
42:07 invitations are going to go out now
42:09 because you don't want any of those
42:11 people there
42:12 and now the organic flow from neighbors
42:14 is not allowed anymore
42:16 hey you know we're down the street we
42:17 just heard you guys you mind if we come
42:19 in they're like no
42:21 but why i mean you know well it's
42:23 because we let some people in once and
42:25 this crazy stuff happened one guy died
42:28 but we're not that kind of oh yeah we
42:29 can't we don't have time to figure that
42:31 out right now
42:31 come back tomorrow during the day we'll
42:33 have a conversation and maybe after that
42:35 you can go to the party
42:37 that's a tiny example of what's been
42:39 going on in a global level
42:41 between countries our youth
42:44 is being programmed to destroy
42:48 their country to destroy their own lives
42:53 they don't understand
42:56 the implications of many of the
42:58 doctrines that they're being told
43:01 i'll give you a for instance
43:04 what if somehow we got to the point
43:06 where universal income is the way that
43:08 everyone makes their money
43:10 and very few people work and do anything
43:14 okay how does food get prepared now
43:17 oh yeah a bunch of people raise food
43:20 either plant or animal it gets all diced
43:24 and sliced up and then it's trucked to
43:26 your
43:26 grocery store and then you gotta get
43:28 someone to stock it for you keep it pay
43:30 all the bills
43:31 build a building etc etc
43:35 all right those people don't need to
43:38 work anymore
43:40 society starts to collapse people start
43:43 to die
43:46 well why aren't we learning this lesson
43:48 right now because that's where we're
43:49 headed that's what they're trying to do
43:52 it's because only a few people are doing
43:54 it
43:56 but now how is a country organized
44:00 you got the people on the bottom
44:03 politicians on the top
44:06 depending on your country maybe you're
44:07 still playing make-believe and you got a
44:08 king and queen up there
44:10 regardless same thing they just
44:14 want to create a narrative
44:17 that is believable that
44:20 this teeny tiny group of mentally ill
44:23 people
44:24 or very young immature people with no
44:27 history
44:28 no wisdom of any kind their parents or
44:31 carbon copies of them
44:32 just aged more then the media puts a
44:36 magnifying glass on
44:37 them if 10 of them show up the media
44:40 films it to make it look like a million
44:42 people showed up
44:44 so when they throw a vote with dominion
44:46 voting machines
44:48 you might actually believe that that's
44:50 real
44:52 and then they change your government
44:54 they change that constitution they
44:56 change
44:57 those protective clauses that keep you
45:00 in a safe place they drum up and
45:04 increase
45:06 the most microscopic laws that are
45:08 impossible to enforce
45:10 because it's they make the law so
45:12 complex you can't know
45:14 the law now right now
45:18 in huntington beach california because
45:19 i'm in orange county california
45:22 they have
45:25 there's been a rumor okay that there's a
45:27 10 o'clock
45:29 10 p.m curfew in all of california for
45:32 this thanksgiving dinner thing
45:35 now what has not occurred is any
45:37 notification on our cell phones
45:40 any little pamphlet that's been held uh
45:42 handed to our homes
45:44 and so if you don't watch tv like me
45:47 you may never know that this exists i
45:50 have friends that are business owners
45:51 calling around trying to figure out if
45:52 it's real
45:55 but you can't be ignorant of the law if
45:56 the law is never communicated to you and
45:58 by the way these aren't laws
46:01 these may just be like i don't know some
46:03 ordinance or something
46:05 but regardless if you impose a
46:08 restriction on human beings
46:10 you got to tell them first you can't
46:12 just pull someone over and go all right
46:14 there's a curfew and you're like well
46:15 how on earth were i supposed to know
46:16 that
46:17 you didn't you could we do amber alerts
46:19 in california
46:21 based off a girl named amber that was
46:23 abducted and killed
46:25 so anytime a child is abducted and
46:28 somebody knows
46:29 and they rifle it into the police
46:32 and it's meant to happen like in seconds
46:34 after it occurs
46:35 we will get amber alerts all the time on
46:37 our phone
46:39 with the make and model of the car some
46:41 information about the suspect
46:43 and everyone's looking around for them
46:48 i believe i have the numbers right but
46:50 great britain is now
46:52 enforcing and i think canada as well of
46:55 course canada is just a
46:57 condom on the phallus of england
47:02 probably australia as well god bless you
47:05 guys who are
47:06 fighting to fight down there but they
47:08 have over 50
47:10 mentally ill identifications
47:13 that are being enforced on other
47:16 citizens
47:17 so some poor 80 year old woman who
47:21 may or may not own a tv she might just
47:23 be building puzzles
47:25 sipping tea and coffee
47:28 she's never been notified about any of
47:30 these things and she's old she can't
47:31 remember anything
47:34 but there's 50 over
47:37 of these mentally ill genders that
47:40 you're supposed to
47:42 remember such that if somebody is in
47:45 front of you
47:45 wearing something that's supposed to put
47:47 them in one of those categories
47:49 and you refer to them as a mr or mrs
47:52 or a miss you get a ticket
47:56 okay let's take the queen of england and
47:59 angela merkel let's wire a shotgun to
48:02 both their heads and say
48:04 okay merkel you're enforcing 72
48:08 identifications in the eu otherwise you
48:11 get a ticket
48:12 i mean they don't usually give it as i
48:14 understand it but that's the law
48:16 england you're over 50. so both you
48:18 ladies
48:19 we're going to give you a chance
48:22 you can you can take all day if you want
48:25 but you have to name the 50 plus in
48:26 england
48:27 and you have to name the 72 in europe
48:29 because ignorance of the law is no
48:31 excuse and you're
48:32 you're enforcing this on your people
48:35 detaining them destroying their lives
48:37 giving them you know robbing them of
48:39 their money
48:41 go and if you don't get it we're pulling
48:43 the trigger
48:45 nobody would live nobody in the whole
48:46 world could pass that test
48:48 probably not even the author of the bill
48:50 could remember them all
48:53 maybe you get 25 right but you still got
48:56 another 25 in england
48:57 and another 50 to go roughly in europe
49:01 how is this even possible that a
49:03 ludicrous thing like that
49:05 is being enforced you're worried about
49:07 how to address a person
49:10 but down the street the sharia law court
49:13 just
49:14 murdered some woman because they wanted
49:16 to
49:18 a little girl just got castrated by her
49:19 father
49:21 a 78 year old guy is marrying a
49:23 seven-year-old
49:25 plans on having another big family which
49:27 means he's going to be
49:29 raping that little girl for years you
49:32 have to
49:33 believe in the rationale of the belief
49:35 system
49:37 in order to take it into your heart and
49:39 soul
49:40 you do so now what do you believe i mean
49:44 what do you really believe
49:47 is um let me ask you a question okay
49:51 there's this big thing about hurting
49:52 people's feelings right
49:54 that's one of the exacerbated
49:57 fake emotions that has been injected
49:59 into the human lexicon
50:02 being offended i have a whole episode on
50:05 it and what i say is that
50:06 that belief system does that belief
50:09 doesn't exist that emotion
50:11 doesn't exist all that's existing is
50:13 you're angry
50:16 that's the only thing that really exists
50:20 so we're worried about hurting other
50:21 people's feelings
50:24 we are being told to do the wrong thing
50:27 in some cases in order to insulate
50:29 someone else's feelings
50:31 well if you believe in a creator of any
50:33 kind
50:35 and you know the guy that i always say
50:39 to you folks as the god that i believe
50:42 in
50:42 i actually think that almost every
50:44 single biblical punishment that's been
50:46 documented by man
50:47 will not be anything that that being
50:50 will
50:51 have had anything to do with ever i
50:54 think we create our own hells
50:57 but let's say you meet god and you have
50:59 a record of doing the wrong thing for
51:01 humanity the wrong thing for your own
51:03 personal life
51:04 perhaps you've corrupted your kids your
51:05 friends your families your spouses
51:07 whatever
51:08 in order to make sure they don't get
51:09 offended based on these human constructs
51:11 of
51:12 what is offended in the first place
51:15 does god care that you offended someone
51:19 as long as you followed what you believe
51:21 to be your god's
51:24 suggested behavior which i think is
51:28 doing no harm to others
51:31 now again harm doing no harm
51:34 was pretty easy to define back in the
51:37 day but they've made it so cerebral and
51:39 advanced it up so much
51:41 that now it's anything and they love it
51:44 like that
51:45 political correctness is a moving target
51:47 on purpose
51:48 so that you can never ever win
51:52 it always hurts no matter what you're
51:55 always in trouble no matter what
51:58 now they've tried to get man scared of
52:00 man
52:01 and they phoned it in and these mouth
52:04 breathers are
52:06 propagating this carrying this they
52:09 can't feed their families they can't pay
52:10 their mortgages
52:11 their car is about to get repo repo'ed
52:14 and they're worried about
52:16 the common cold but let me ask you this
52:19 other god question before we move on
52:23 let's say you're in a car with your
52:24 buddy and
52:27 something happens both of you die in a
52:29 car accident
52:30 doesn't matter whose fault it is both of
52:33 you
52:34 you're dead now you're going to go meet
52:36 god
52:38 no if you're existential maybe you're
52:41 god and you'd
52:42 still be able to get this wisdom from
52:44 this example do you think
52:48 maybe maybe this happens but do you
52:50 think you're going to evaluate
52:52 your performance as man in this
52:53 temporary vessel you had
52:55 control over for a little while with
52:58 your body next to you
53:00 are you going to go up there with all
53:01 the people that ever
53:03 interacted with you to tell tattletail
53:05 on you
53:06 do you think it's going to be that
53:08 juvenile is it going to be grade school
53:10 again
53:10 it's going to be the daycare center
53:12 again well he told me a poopoo head you
53:13 know
53:15 i'm thinking not i'm thinking you're
53:17 gonna get a nice
53:18 personal interaction with god to assess
53:21 anything that you
53:22 feel like you want to assess perhaps
53:24 assessment isn't even part of
53:26 dying you're just like well welcome it's
53:28 like a prodigal son situation
53:31 the guy that took all the inheritance
53:32 and got some tna and
53:35 blew all the money came back to his
53:36 father and the father was so happy to
53:38 see him he slaughtered the biggest bull
53:42 and it was the it was the other sun it
53:45 was actually good but
53:47 lost a little bit that said hey hey hey
53:49 why are you slaughtering a bull for that
53:51 guy he was the jerk that took half of
53:53 our money
53:54 and he said look dude you got your half
53:57 you do what you want with it
53:58 he's not getting another half but my son
54:01 is back
54:02 the one i love he's my offspring
54:05 he's your brother stop being a douche
54:11 i think that's a story more about god
54:13 than about man but if we could learn
54:15 something from that story
54:16 hey i think our life will be a little
54:18 bit better
54:20 one of the ways to look at this is that
54:23 there are
54:24 extremely specific
54:27 archetypes that are underneath the
54:29 belief system
54:31 that are aimed at specific groups
54:34 but there are archetypes that are aimed
54:36 at everybody
54:38 because let me tell you
54:41 here's one of the funny things and
54:43 people have picked up on this over the
54:45 last four years
54:48 if everyone
54:51 capitulated to all of this general
54:54 neutral stuff
54:57 overnight we all said fine that's great
54:59 72 in europe 52 in england or whatever
55:02 it is
55:03 absolutely and everyone memorized them
55:05 and no one ever got that wrong
55:07 oh well then the tension's gone there's
55:10 no more fighting between us
55:11 now we're starting to unite again guess
55:14 what
55:15 they'd come up with something else
55:18 they would come up with something else
55:20 for those that are so concerned about
55:22 racism
55:24 all right let's take that just a couple
55:26 steps further
55:29 um pick a race any race we'll pick a
55:32 black race
55:34 everyone else on earth is eliminated off
55:37 the planet
55:38 everyone else who's here has some black
55:41 blood in them
55:42 because that's according to chuck d and
55:45 that's what makes you black
55:46 any ounce of black indian you're black i
55:49 think he's right
55:50 that's how we classify it okay so
55:53 everyone else who's pure
55:55 out of that pigmentation they're gone
55:58 now what happens well malcolm x talked
56:01 about
56:02 when he was a kid he was a light-skinned
56:03 brother
56:05 he got crap for being light-skinned
56:08 oh so now we're going to have the shades
56:10 of black that are going to have to fight
56:12 out you're not going to be a shadist
56:15 you're too dark you're too light
56:18 you have something other than black
56:20 blood in you can't prove it but i can
56:22 tell
56:23 you're lenny krevitz okay so all mulatto
56:27 people are then the second that are
56:28 eliminated
56:31 now the rest of the blacks look at each
56:32 other and go the africans are really
56:35 dark and they're looking at us white
56:36 they're the black guys over here
56:38 in america which they call white
56:42 now you're not black enough or you're
56:44 not brown enough well okay
56:46 i guess the lighter brown black people
56:49 are going to have a lot more access to
56:50 education and weaponry
56:52 so they're going to destroy all those
56:54 super dark people
56:56 probably come up with some either
56:58 reprise a bunch of the old
57:00 slanderous names
57:03 and now we get down to a one shade race
57:08 and this could be any race i'm just
57:10 using blacks
57:12 okay now what's going to happen
57:16 well some people have blue eyes who are
57:18 black and some people have brown eyes
57:20 that are black
57:23 so even though you're lighter you've got
57:25 the white man's
57:27 blue eyes in you you got to go it's all
57:30 blue eye you guys are going
57:32 see where we're going right but
57:34 eventually we turn into who's too tall
57:36 who's too short
57:38 who doesn't have enough hair who has too
57:40 much hair
57:42 they will continue to go to the next
57:44 level
57:45 which is why none of this works why
57:49 the party of tolerance is the most
57:52 untolerating people
57:54 they're always the inverse of what they
57:57 think they are because they are low
57:58 vibration
58:00 low educated people antifa
58:03 is a fascist organization they will
58:06 march down the street
58:08 talking about no justice no peace and
58:11 then they attack a black person
58:14 because they're building people with
58:16 them too i mean it's just nuts
58:18 we are seeing their brains their
58:21 dysfunctional brains
58:23 in cities destroying their own property
58:27 their own communities and
58:30 everyone seems to forget the one percent
58:32 movement that happened about 10 years
58:34 ago in wall street remember when they
58:35 all
58:36 went down there and made tents and they
58:37 were so profound
58:39 their lattes and their cell phones
58:42 what was that movement about it was
58:45 about them
58:46 believing that one percent of the world
58:50 owns the whole place and 99 are stuck at
58:53 the bottom and can't do anything to fix
58:55 the problem
58:56 except for convert to socialism
59:00 but they all shop at amazon walmart
59:03 all the big brands gotta have their
59:04 nikes gotta have all their corporate
59:07 stuff so they're shopping out of the one
59:09 percent
59:10 blaming the one percent for having the
59:11 money that they made when they could go
59:13 to the bomb and pop shop oh but they
59:14 burned that down that's right
59:18 what is this whole thing in 2020 doing
59:22 it's making banks and corporations
59:26 massively rich massively rich
59:30 if you thought bezos was rich today
59:33 it for every month this goes by that
59:35 guy's adding zeros on his paycheck
59:38 because everyone's ordering everything
59:39 on amazon
59:41 why because you're terrified to go into
59:44 a store
59:45 you're taught that if we wore masks this
59:47 thing would be over by now
59:50 doesn't matter if you do as a matter of
59:54 fact there's no logic in it at all
59:56 if you went to a store where everyone's
59:58 wearing it
60:00 and you don't well they're protected
60:02 you're not hey you're the one at risk
60:04 nope this common cold has a 14 day
60:08 gestation period because that's what
60:09 colds have
60:10 right we've all had colds before you
60:13 know it creeps up on you slowly over
60:14 time
60:15 if you don't get enough sunlight take
60:16 your vitamins eat right
60:20 but they're worried that you're going to
60:21 pin it down to a particular retailer
60:24 it's impossible to pin it down to a
60:27 retailer
60:28 you can't if you get mail delivered to
60:31 your house and you believe the stupid
60:33 well is it mit harvard medical
60:36 experiments where they say they got
60:38 kovid to live on a surface for like
60:40 some ungodly amount of hours or do you
60:43 get your mail within 24 hours well
60:44 that's well within the
60:46 proverbial envelope of time
60:49 that they said kovac could exist on a
60:50 surface which is all lie
60:54 those conditions don't exist in the real
60:56 world
60:57 the world is being torn apart by all
61:00 this
61:01 crazy brand new belief system
61:04 a system that wasn't broken in many
61:06 cases
61:08 is being broken the stuff that was
61:10 broken and perhaps is broken
61:12 it definitely isn't getting fixed
61:15 because of these people because they
61:18 in well the controllers invent games
61:22 that can never be won we had a gigantic
61:26 example of this after 9 11.
61:29 we had a boogeyman created out of a
61:32 conglomerate of agents
61:34 for a particular alphabet agency who
61:37 made a database
61:40 of their agents they created an
61:43 army called al qaeda who george bush jr
61:46 would often refer to as its clinical
61:48 name alcia
61:52 he was always having a conversation on
61:53 air force one or in the backyard
61:56 using the proper um intelligence
61:59 description of them and so you come out
62:02 and say it
62:03 just like joe biden was talking about
62:06 this
62:06 comprehensive voter fraud system in the
62:09 room before he walked out and repeated
62:11 it
62:12 i got a buddy of mine who does that all
62:13 the time he's in his 70s and if we
62:16 would do a presentation together i would
62:18 say look you're not supposed to say that
62:20 we're not allowed to admit that
62:21 you oh oh okay now he'd already been
62:23 told 20 times but he's old so he's
62:25 forgetting
62:26 and what did he do walk around the
62:27 presentation third thing out of his
62:29 mouth is the secret thing he's not
62:30 supposed to say
62:32 we never got in trouble but that's just
62:34 because the people
62:36 who told us not to tell anybody probably
62:38 never found out that we admitted it
62:41 but they created al qaeda it was the
62:46 random group of guys that hates us and
62:49 so we're starting to fight this war that
62:50 can't be fought because you can't find
62:52 the enemy
62:53 when we had al-qaeda fatigue john mccain
62:57 flies over the midwest or sorry middle
62:59 east excuse me midwest of the middle
63:01 east
63:02 over to syria and elects a brand new
63:05 group of people
63:06 one of trump killed and created isis
63:10 brand new name totally funded they were
63:13 stealing
63:14 supposedly billions of dollars worth of
63:16 oil out of northern syria and then
63:18 finding probably turkey to sell it to or
63:20 whatever
63:21 probably all lies brand new enemy
63:26 religion depending on where you live
63:30 is either beneficial to you or not
63:32 beneficial to you
63:35 if you're involved in any type of
63:36 religion where you commonly think about
63:38 exterminating another religion probably
63:41 not doing much for you
63:43 if you can be involved in religion and
63:44 compartmentalize it to your life
63:47 you're probably okay it's just for you
63:51 maybe your wife or husband believes the
63:52 same thing maybe your kids grow up to
63:54 believe the same thing
63:56 but maybe they don't but it's between
63:58 you and god
64:00 at a minimum again they're not going
64:03 with you
64:04 to go into the room to be evaluated if
64:06 you believe in such things
64:09 god would need no testimony from another
64:10 person for he would know it all
64:13 so if someone's going to speak on your
64:14 behalf it's a pointless exercise
64:17 god already knows you're half he knows
64:19 both halves
64:21 he doesn't need to get both sides of the
64:23 story he is both sides of the story
64:26 it's funny because you know i've talked
64:28 to a psychologist one time
64:30 at a church of mine because he was a
64:32 psych professor at pepperdine
64:35 and he just offered me a session i
64:36 thought man because i was reading tons
64:38 of psychology books
64:40 you know i used to play darts together
64:41 at his house and just had a really good
64:43 friendship with him and he really helped
64:46 me
64:46 resolve some anger issues with my
64:48 parents
64:49 which was very minor but it was still a
64:51 pimple that needed to be popped you know
64:54 but i have plenty of friends here in
64:57 california
64:58 both just friend friends that are just
65:00 little normal people going to
65:02 psychiatrists and i've got some
65:03 celebrity friends that have done it
65:06 but what typically happens in these
65:07 sessions
65:09 is that a person doesn't understand why
65:11 they behave a certain way
65:13 why they have certain thoughts that they
65:14 have
65:17 it's going to be a slight digression on
65:19 that meeting with god but think about it
65:21 you go up there with maybe a bad record
65:23 here and there
65:24 hopefully nothing horrid even if you had
65:28 a serial killer
65:29 past you go up there and you're like i
65:32 don't know why i
65:34 needed to do this but i felt like i did
65:37 and so i did this horrible thing to a
65:39 bunch of people
65:41 he's the ultimate psychologist
65:44 except where a psychologist will sit and
65:47 listen to you and write it
65:48 write notes down and suggest things to
65:50 you and use various techniques on you to
65:52 get you to hear your own voice
65:53 and charge a lot of money per hour god
65:56 doesn't do that
65:57 if god exists he or she would know it
66:00 all
66:02 well you know it was really this this
66:05 this this this all triggered together
66:07 that's how you became that killer i knew
66:09 you were going to be that way
66:11 and there was nothing that was going to
66:12 stop that except for me intervening
66:14 which i don't do
66:16 so don't worry about it we'll do better
66:20 next time
66:22 but next time might be exactly the same
66:24 way
66:26 you are your soul you're not your mind
66:29 you're not your body
66:31 i don't know is whether or not a serial
66:33 killer actually
66:36 is happy a lot of the time
66:40 i tend to think not which is why they go
66:42 out to try and
66:43 get a new dump of dopamine and do
66:45 something bad again
66:47 so hopefully if you came back you would
66:48 stick to your guns with being happy
66:50 happy
66:51 and not run off doing something nuts
66:55 so how do we stop this
66:59 problem i think that we're all figuring
67:02 it out
67:03 and the big part is to divorce
67:06 yourself from social media
67:10 again if you're trying to find people
67:11 like yourself maybe that's how you
67:13 quarantine
67:14 it down but you keep a little bit let's
67:16 just say you wanted to
67:17 know what other deep thought listeners
67:19 are thinking
67:20 so you at least quarantine it to just
67:22 one little place you go you don't go to
67:23 your feed you don't
67:24 get rid of all your friends off social
67:26 media just get rid of them
67:28 unless there may be part of that click
67:30 where you find like-minded people
67:34 what's the other thing you can do
67:37 turn off all mass media
67:41 your tv can stay on you can watch a
67:44 bunch of puppy dog videos on youtube
67:46 watch your favorite movie on whatever
67:48 movie service you're using
67:50 but i think that most of us in 2020 are
67:53 viewing old shows
67:54 completely different than we used to
67:58 we can see the indoctrination and how it
68:00 was turned on and how it was ramped up
68:03 i mean you know i just mentioned her in
68:06 the previous episode but
68:07 watch leave it to beaver or my three
68:10 sons
68:11 or whatever show brady bunch or whatever
68:14 and then just watch cardi b
68:16 watch a reality show
68:19 and just feel the difference in
68:23 the emotion that they're expressing in
68:26 the show
68:27 the goal of the moral base what was
68:30 leave it to beaver's whole thing
68:33 it was a standard archetype that went
68:34 all the way up to
68:36 the fresh prince of bel-air right it was
68:39 somebody did something wrong at the
68:40 beginning
68:41 they hid it then there was the
68:45 slow reveal and then poof at the very
68:48 end
68:48 it was i know i shouldn't have done that
68:50 but it was a moral uptick at the end of
68:52 every episode to make you feel better
68:54 brady bunch same way
68:56 fresh prince of bel air the same way
68:59 it really clicked with me when i watched
69:01 uh it was a fresh prince
69:03 episode where they broke a lamp at the
69:06 very beginning of the episode and then
69:08 tried to hide it this has been done
69:10 several times and cheers and a bunch of
69:12 other stuff
69:13 and then of course at the end they got
69:15 more trouble for hiding it than for
69:17 breaking it
69:18 moral uptick don't lie just if something
69:22 bad happens admit it
69:23 all right what's today
69:27 was a breaking bad make meth
69:30 never follow where it goes to hurt
69:32 people who take it
69:34 feel really excited about the meth maker
69:37 and his buddy
69:38 the cop that's starting to get onto
69:40 their path well let's wish him all the
69:42 harm because we don't want this
69:44 negative luciferian character
69:48 to be stopped if you're awake
69:52 then you get a privileged title
69:58 and i think you can call yourself one of
70:00 a couple things if not both
70:02 which is you're an elder of your village
70:07 which just might be your house the other
70:10 one
70:10 is has a little bit of an extra skill to
70:14 it
70:15 which is what i call the chieftain the
70:18 chieftain
70:19 only you know if you're a chieftain
70:22 which is if you envisioned yourself on a
70:25 remote island you're part of the lost
70:27 cast right and you're on a remote island
70:29 and you got nothing you got whatever
70:32 was in the wreckage and then you look
70:34 back at the island and you can see some
70:36 things look like they're edible
70:38 you can see some wildlife in there okay
70:40 gonna figure out how to kill those
70:42 things
70:42 if you envision yourself as a person who
70:45 would take charge
70:47 and build the society protect the women
70:49 protect the children
70:51 hunt we're going to divide up
70:55 tasks and of course there's some women
70:57 out there that'll
70:59 hunt like crazy but whatever you
71:01 identify
71:02 as in terms of your capabilities you
71:05 split off into those groups and you are
71:07 just one that's going to work with
71:08 people you know that people are
71:09 different
71:10 you know you're going to deal with a lot
71:11 of psychological conflicts
71:14 but you're ready for it you're going to
71:15 keep steady and calm and cool
71:18 but as an elder you've got libraries of
71:20 wisdom
71:22 you know the difference between [ __ ] and
71:24 shinola like they sent into the jerk
71:26 right
71:28 then you're a chieftain as well but let
71:31 me give you another
71:32 upgrade that only you know
71:36 and that would be you're also an
71:39 architect of society
71:42 i don't think we get to that level
71:44 without a lot of study
71:46 if you're watching this show regularly
71:48 you probably are an architect
71:50 you may have never been given the job
71:52 yet
71:54 but you could come in and the way one
71:57 good way to think about or one easy way
71:59 to think about and being an architect
72:01 of humanity would be either look at the
72:04 robber barons that wrote
72:05 magna carta about a thousand a.d or look
72:09 at the forefathers of america who wrote
72:10 the constitution
72:12 you know bizarrely they're all masons
72:14 for some reason but perhaps even the
72:16 masons weren't so corrupt back in those
72:17 days don't know
72:19 seems strange it does but you could
72:22 write a constitution
72:24 you could write a declaration of
72:25 independence by yourself
72:28 because you understand you could write
72:29 the bill of rights
72:31 because you understand the
72:34 causality connections with a lack of
72:38 freedom
72:39 you know how subtle freedoms can be
72:42 eroded and you know how blatant
72:44 freedoms can be eroded you understand a
72:47 judicial system of being accused of
72:51 something
72:52 there's an evidentiary phase of
72:55 discovery then there's a trial
72:57 there's witnesses you get equal
72:59 representation on both sides meaning
73:01 someone goes up to the box to talk
73:03 for the prosecution you get to be a
73:06 defendant you get to ask the same
73:08 whatever questions you want to that
73:09 person if you're at those levels
73:14 then i think that you are extremely
73:16 equipped to evaluate
73:18 everything that you serendipitously
73:20 absorbed throughout your life
73:23 and then you can conduct a massive audit
73:25 on your own system
73:29 there are certain things in life that
73:31 feel like
73:32 well they were described as being very
73:34 liberating
73:36 you know for my friends that who figured
73:39 out that they were gay
73:41 and perhaps lived in areas of the world
73:43 that weren't accustomed to that
73:46 let's say 80s 90s but they moved to an
73:49 area where it was much more accepted
73:52 than they were liberated because they
73:55 didn't
73:56 feel like in their own mind that
73:57 everybody was sending darts at them
74:00 they usually move to a big city where it
74:01 doesn't matter what you are no one pays
74:03 attention to you
74:04 so sometimes that can just be the food
74:06 that you're looking for
74:09 if you look a certain way talk a certain
74:11 way whatever
74:12 nobody's like jumping from you
74:16 that could be liberating if you're in a
74:18 job that's not really taking advantage
74:20 of your skills
74:22 you took it because you needed the cash
74:24 or maybe it's your first job and you
74:25 haven't quite found that other job yet
74:29 you know in your heart of hearts every
74:32 day that you're alive
74:34 you're more than this and so you go home
74:38 and you keep churning on that
74:39 other skill that's really your your love
74:42 of your life
74:43 and you transition into it and you're
74:45 liberated man
74:47 what was it uh the lead singer of huey
74:50 lewis
74:52 there's so many actors and singers i
74:54 should just say it this way but the huey
74:56 lewis guy forget
74:57 is that his name yeah he was like a
75:01 landscape guy before he got his first
75:04 album out the door
75:05 the uh the baker tom baker who played
75:09 doctor who
75:10 in the 70s for a long time he was a
75:11 construction guy he was like building a
75:13 building
75:14 and then he said i got to go and do this
75:16 audition and then poof
75:17 he becomes one of the most famous sci-fi
75:19 celebrities in
75:20 bbc history well i could be you
75:24 just think if you were to reset your
75:28 brain
75:29 to a common law practice
75:33 what'll end up happening is in my
75:35 opinion is what will bubble to the top
75:37 of your
75:38 cauldron will be all of this
75:41 crazy and then you can just
75:45 wipe it off the top into the trash can
75:49 and there you are you have the most
75:51 perfect stew which is your brain
75:54 your belief system not hurting anybody
75:57 once you purify your mind
76:01 and i do this ritually i mean i do this
76:03 system ritually i study everything i
76:05 believe
76:06 as much as i possibly can day to day
76:09 but once you do it and you live in it
76:11 you live in the purity of your mind
76:15 as you run into other paradigms through
76:18 other people
76:20 you have a perspective that's so much
76:22 more clear
76:25 you know one of the things i noticed and
76:27 it's just interesting when i used to
76:30 be on twitter before they suspended us
76:32 for revealing event 201 to
76:34 jim acosta's feed which was the
76:37 event i just pushed send and boom i was
76:41 immediately banned i would look at
76:44 people's replies to things
76:46 that are very heated of course that's
76:47 all twitter is is a divide and conquer
76:49 platform which is why no one should be
76:51 on it
76:53 i would see these diatribes these like
76:55 huge monologues from people that are
76:57 just stating the most
76:58 trite repetitive stuff
77:02 and what wasn't being said was anything
77:06 really conclusive anything truly inter
77:09 introspective and so what i would do is
77:11 get up there and put in
77:12 just a sentence half a sentence
77:16 and i knew that that reply was was uh
77:19 getting people to look inside themselves
77:21 so a lot of people will see it
77:22 and they can't make any sense out of it
77:25 because they're still stuck
77:26 on stupid they're still stuck on the
77:29 divide
77:30 and trying to spread it around as much
77:32 as possible
77:33 there are a lot of people at the end of
77:35 the day whether or not they realize it
77:36 or not in these other groups
77:38 that are keeping a tally in their mind
77:40 of how much they've destroyed society
77:42 today
77:43 and they sleep better the more that
77:45 they've done it
77:47 i was in a parking lot yesterday for
77:49 lunch because i had to stand outside
77:53 and i parked my car and i go up to this
77:56 window and where i'm
77:59 standing there's a bar like a sports bar
78:03 it's now all outside a tattoo parlor
78:07 and my smoke shop and this place i eat
78:13 and there's a bunch of dudes out middle
78:15 of the afternoon
78:16 and this guy is yelling and screaming
78:18 from a car behind me
78:21 and i'm kind of like you know i'm
78:22 walking in you know you don't hear
78:23 things until you really focus
78:24 because i'm just parking my car and then
78:28 over the next 10 minutes this guy was
78:30 yelling at somebody
78:31 over by the tattoo parlor i don't even
78:34 know who he was yeah because he said
78:35 some guy in a yellow hat and i looked
78:36 over i couldn't see anyone a yellow hat
78:38 but all these like bikers these big
78:41 badass tattoo guys
78:44 the guys that own the shop they're just
78:45 sitting out there smiling
78:47 listen to this guy and this dude is on a
78:50 roll
78:51 standing next to his car
78:54 yelling at somebody calling him all
78:56 these names but i
78:57 turn around to order my food and there's
79:00 a father's son right in front of me
79:03 it's a little nine-year-old kid right in
79:04 front of me he's all bundled up
79:06 little mask on his face and he's just
79:10 looking at this guy
79:11 and i just saw myself as a kid right
79:13 there
79:15 he's seeing stuff that uh it's probably
79:17 healthy for him to see
79:19 but he kind of looked up at me for a
79:20 split second and i just looked at him
79:22 and i smiled i don't have a mask once
79:23 you see my face
79:25 i said whatever you do i said don't ever
79:27 be like that guy
79:29 and i saw his eyes he just went yeah
79:31 it's kind of what i was just thinking
79:33 you know
79:35 so we you know his dad's right there in
79:37 front of big old dude
79:40 no stranger danger there and i just uh
79:43 i'm watching the kid i'm watching him
79:45 suck all this down you know
79:48 and finally i just you know we're saying
79:50 something else you know
79:51 just like oh my gosh this is nuts isn't
79:53 it yep yep
79:54 i said what's what you're really seeing
79:57 right there is there's a problem inside
79:58 him
80:00 all that stuff he's saying a bunch of
80:02 filthy
80:03 horrible stuff man turns out the kid
80:06 actually wasn't the son of the guy in
80:07 front of me
80:08 his dad was one of the owners of the
80:10 tattoo parlor shop so i know the kid's
80:11 scene quite a bit probably
80:14 but i just said you know you're really
80:15 hearing about all of his broken stuff
80:17 inside of him
80:18 and i liked it that i had the
80:20 opportunity to say that because when i
80:21 was a kid
80:23 adults saying stuff like to me that to
80:25 me changed my life it changed my
80:27 perception of everything
80:29 there was a relative in my family and i
80:31 think this was a false assessment to be
80:33 honest before i say this
80:34 one of my relatives my mom was talking
80:38 about this relative and she said you
80:39 know
80:40 i don't think he likes himself
80:43 that's why he behaves the way he behaves
80:46 now as i got to know him a lot better as
80:48 i got older i think that again was a
80:50 false assessment or maybe it was that
80:51 phase of his life that i have no
80:53 information on to this day
80:55 but that kind of thought process to go
80:58 wow
80:58 people actually don't like themselves it
81:00 was such a shocking
81:03 twist in my brain i didn't think that
81:05 was possible
81:06 how could you not like yourself and then
81:09 i've met
81:10 several people since then who do not
81:12 like themselves
81:14 you know i got a good friend of mine who
81:15 will tell you to your face how much he
81:17 hates himself
81:18 and i don't really understand that at
81:20 all
81:21 like if you were really that bad dude i
81:23 wouldn't be your friend
81:26 and you wouldn't have the hundred friend
81:27 100 friends that love you and rely on
81:29 you daily that you never let down so
81:31 what what's your big thing
81:34 i used to say and i i probably still do
81:36 but
81:37 i haven't had to say it in a while but
81:38 you know if you're raised to believe
81:41 something whether it be religion or
81:42 something else
81:44 and you continue to just swallow what
81:46 your parents shovel down your throat or
81:48 society shovels down your throat
81:50 and you complete a couple decades with
81:52 that belief system inside you
81:55 regardless if there's any truth to it at
81:57 all
81:58 you are almost genetically prohibited
82:01 from ever shaking that belief in its
82:04 entirety
82:05 because once you start once you actually
82:07 shake off a belief system
82:09 there's something that happens and that
82:12 is
82:12 what if you were deceived as a kid into
82:14 some type of religion that was bad
82:17 and then you wake up and find out wow
82:18 that was a bad religion
82:22 if you can come to complete closure on
82:24 that something will happen
82:26 you won't bad-mouth that religion in
82:29 a really super negative way
82:34 you hear me talk about george carlin a
82:35 lot i think he was mentally broken
82:38 by the catholic church he had a very bad
82:41 experience going to the catholic schools
82:43 in brooklyn
82:45 so his routine on stage was
82:48 there's a there's a little segment he
82:50 does on it that is the most hateful
82:53 black oil version of him
82:56 but it's only about that everything else
82:59 he can make fun of in a positive way
83:01 but when he goes on when he went onto
83:03 religion it was horrid
83:05 he's still hurting inside he didn't
83:07 resolve it
83:09 which is why he projects what's inside
83:11 himself
83:13 so we know about religion we know that's
83:16 an easy one everyone who isn't in
83:18 religion
83:19 in a very hell and you know it was a
83:22 hell and brimstone kind of way
83:24 fire brimstone excuse me
83:28 you can look at it much more objectively
83:30 and just say yeah well that
83:32 that group of people is really worried
83:34 about all these things all these
83:36 punishments they've got god down to
83:38 an abject [ __ ] who's just sitting down
83:40 there going
83:41 what else can i burn which is all
83:44 wrathful
83:44 crazy crazy human you know if if there
83:48 was a human on earth
83:49 that had all the despicable behaviors of
83:52 god that has been documented in the
83:53 bible
83:54 you wouldn't be his friend you would be
83:56 like that dude's nut student and
83:57 just don't even get next to him because
83:59 if you say the wrong thing he'll try to
84:00 set you on fire
84:04 but at the same book they'll tell you
84:05 the truth that he's infinitely
84:07 patient and forgiving and you can't have
84:10 both men
84:10 you can't have both infinite
84:14 infinitely forgiving why does hell exist
84:17 again
84:18 if there's infinite forgiveness oh but
84:20 you gotta follow these rules that
84:22 man will hand down to you you know it's
84:24 like strange right
84:27 we are a being that's trying to figure
84:28 this thing out
84:32 we don't have a right and i don't know
84:35 if we'll ever get anything right
84:38 you have to obviously get rid of the
84:41 individuals
84:43 who are manifesting this divide globally
84:48 they love religion because they know it
84:50 just takes a
84:52 just a little eye dropper in the ocean
84:54 to get the ocean to fight itself
84:57 they know that and so they do it they're
85:00 pouring buckets in
85:02 where they know there's love they can
85:05 create divide
85:07 but they've now come after the subatomic
85:11 behaviors of man they're trying to get
85:14 your autonomic system
85:16 the one that makes you breathe the one
85:18 that makes you walk the one that keeps
85:19 you alive when you're asleep
85:22 they want that thing to rebel against
85:24 you
85:26 they want to divide every single thing
85:29 that's joined
85:30 except themselves what's the motto of
85:33 the show
85:35 the motto of the show is rebuilding
85:37 humanity from the bottom up
85:39 that's why i do so many of these
85:40 episodes
85:42 but there's two ways to look at that if
85:45 you believe it
85:47 and you're a contributor you're just as
85:49 much a contributor as i am
85:51 in fact i would always give probably
85:52 more credit to people i don't even know
85:54 who watch the show
85:56 seeing what i mean and and paraphrasing
85:59 in a much easier container
86:03 but we have the organic growth out of
86:06 societal problems which is the best way
86:09 to do it
86:11 and then we have the more militant
86:14 violent sudden transformations in human
86:17 society
86:19 known as revolutions known as civil wars
86:22 known as world wars there's a
86:25 there's a divide in the belief system
86:30 right now the group that is causing the
86:32 problem for the world
86:34 including their subjects is a very very
86:37 tiny group of people i don't care what
86:40 you believe
86:41 i promise you the media has put a
86:43 magnifying magnifying glass on these
86:45 problems
86:46 on these individual groups made of
86:48 almost no one
86:49 to make you think that antifa is a 1
86:52 billion strong army
86:54 the blm is a 1 billion strong army
86:58 we can address any of their concerns
87:00 intellectually
87:02 without fair violence without their
87:05 killing without their prejudice their
87:08 intolerance
87:09 and their fascism
87:13 but as long as they're on the streets
87:14 fighting we can't have a conversation
87:17 can we
87:19 and we know that 90 percent of these
87:22 quote unquote members are there to steal
87:25 stuff out of stores
87:26 under the umbrella that they're
87:28 protesters
87:30 we know that for a fact we want to deal
87:33 with this as soon as possible with the
87:35 least amount of
87:37 conflict between us
87:40 what's the best way well the best way
87:42 would be to find out a way
87:44 to calm these groups down to to get them
87:47 to
87:48 list their demands and see what we can
87:49 do
87:52 now we'll probably throw out most of
87:54 them because they're probably unfounded
87:56 now what if there's some good stuff in
87:58 there i guarantee
88:00 you you know as i've said unification of
88:02 the police
88:03 methodology within a particular country
88:06 should be
88:06 absolute so i'm in alaska like i said
88:09 should have the same treatment as
88:10 someone in florida
88:13 substitute your country with the two
88:14 farthest regions
88:17 from each other and you understand what
88:19 i'm saying
88:21 because here's the thing during
88:24 revolutions let's just say
88:28 the problem is is that this the members
88:31 of the revolution
88:33 who are usually doing most of the
88:35 fighting are in a fight or flight
88:37 state of mind until it's over
88:41 and we know just go watch my left brain
88:43 right brain
88:44 episode that during those phases we
88:48 don't think very clearly
88:52 meaning we don't make good choices
88:56 the dictators that have risen up over
88:59 time
88:59 hopefully that's the right word arisen
89:04 arose coming to power
89:07 they have typically been made of the
89:10 gullible masses
89:11 because what could a dictator possibly
89:13 convince
89:15 but a gullible mass they can't
89:18 convince the intellectuals of a
89:20 particular society to go along with them
89:22 so guess who has been traditionally the
89:24 target of those groups
89:27 all the smart people
89:30 it's so bad that you know this this
89:33 firebombing of dresden
89:35 in germany believe that's in germany
89:40 you may have had hitler call it in
89:44 could you please bomb dresden that's
89:47 where all my resistance is
89:50 mao he just killed him pol pot
89:53 just killed him mussolini just killed
89:56 him
89:58 anyone who will uprise against you will
90:00 get killed
90:01 what is china doing they're using the
90:02 social credit system
90:04 to essentially kill off a person's life
90:09 house arrest if you write a single
90:11 article about legitimate corruption
90:12 within their country
90:15 i'm sure at their higher levels of the
90:16 ccp
90:18 they view themselves as hey this is a
90:20 team effort
90:21 we are engaging in criminal activities
90:25 but it's for the greater good
90:27 just you don't understand all the big
90:28 picture stuff so shut up
90:32 hmm poisonous beliefs
90:37 there are so many flavors inside the
90:39 vending machine of poisonous beliefs now
90:41 that you will probably have to depending
90:44 on how strong-minded you are and how
90:46 centered you are as of today
90:49 you're going to be living in a constant
90:50 defense mode
90:52 for a while hopefully not forever
90:57 meaning every day you get up as someone
91:00 starts to tell you you've done wrong or
91:02 did you hear they passed the new law
91:05 you know the one in scotland i guess got
91:07 passed where the kids can now tell on
91:09 their parents
91:11 at the dinner table you know that
91:12 parents say something offensive
91:15 and the scottish court system is going
91:17 to take a kid's word over his parents
91:21 whoa whoa unbelievable man
91:25 um i can't wait to hear the first cases
91:27 it's going to be horrific
91:29 it used to be that your mind was your
91:31 own domain you could do whatever you
91:32 wanted with it
91:33 and only you know maybe your spoken word
91:36 but i even think your spoken word was
91:38 protected i mean our first amendment's
91:39 our first amendment and again as we say
91:41 on this show
91:44 one of the things one of the reasons why
91:45 i always tell you guys that if you're
91:46 angry at someone
91:50 you probably should
91:53 practice arguing with them by yourself
91:57 because if you don't you're going to say
91:59 stupid things that you might regret the
92:01 second your mouth
92:02 produces the word so get it all out of
92:05 your system
92:07 but now we're getting to a point where
92:08 surveillance
92:10 has infected your children in scotland
92:13 your children are little security
92:15 cameras now
92:16 and what do they know about all the all
92:19 the contextual circumstances of
92:20 everything that you say
92:23 they're getting you to fear what's
92:26 inside your head
92:27 as being a crime that they're going to
92:30 find a way
92:32 to persecute you for prosecute you for
92:36 charge you for it wow
92:39 again i think if i called every single
92:42 one of you in january of this year and i
92:44 said
92:46 what if the world health organization
92:48 phoned in that the common cold
92:50 was suddenly more deadly than everything
92:52 else in the entire world and they told
92:54 everyone to stay inside
92:55 not work to fear each other you couldn't
92:59 be close to each other you had to wear a
93:00 mask on your face which isn't
93:02 scientifically capable of protecting you
93:03 against what they're telling you
93:05 is a danger do you think they could pull
93:09 it off
93:11 and what's crazy is and this is just a
93:14 guess on my part is i think most
93:16 intellectual people would go no way
93:18 i mean you know some people would do it
93:19 but not the masses the masses won't do
93:21 that i mean everyone has to work
93:23 everyone has to feed their kids and boy
93:26 were we wrong
93:29 but what if i called the same number of
93:31 people as a control case
93:33 outside of our group
93:36 i might have got a whole bunch of thumbs
93:38 up
93:39 well there was no way for me to conduct
93:41 that exercise because one i didn't know
93:43 it was coming and two
93:44 i don't probably know a lot of those
93:46 other people
93:48 so we all got surprised and it's still
93:50 going strong
93:52 it's going crazy strong the lockdowns
93:55 in this latter part of 2020 are worse
93:58 than the initial ones unreal
94:03 so if you see the wisdom in this episode
94:06 you're definitely going to want to
94:07 paraphrase it better than i put it over
94:09 an hour and whatever
94:11 30 minutes or so you people are the key
94:16 to reboiling this
94:20 refiningness and getting it out to
94:24 your next of kin that will listen to you
94:26 the folks that are like you
94:28 so we can continue turning the message
94:30 down to a single sentence a single word
94:32 something and maybe start affecting
94:35 change
94:37 to a more stable method of existing
94:41 thought police used to be a pretty
94:42 indirect crime in this world
94:45 it no longer is it's a blatant ritual
94:49 and i don't think that anyone can
94:51 survive that system
94:54 ever ever ever ever
94:57 and i'm just going to repeat this again
94:59 i would love to have
95:00 here's a little homework for you in the
95:03 comments down below
95:05 tell me if you've ever seen thx1138
95:09 and as a little bonus tell me if you've
95:12 ever seen rollerball 1975.
95:16 if you can't write yes you need to get
95:18 to at least the first movie
95:21 study it based on where we are today
95:25 and the vectors of where we are going
95:27 from today
95:29 in thx 1138 you're looking at a fascist
95:32 world
95:35 the cops are god but there's going to be
95:38 a point in the movie
95:39 where the main character is going to
95:43 talk to jesus
95:46 in that movie and it's not going to be
95:48 what you think
95:50 so think about boston dynamics creating
95:53 all these robots
95:55 all these robots around the world and
95:57 what is it saudi arabia now they're cops
96:00 or they're little cops you know
96:03 it's going there but watch the movie
96:06 let me know what you think if you've
96:08 already seen it let me know what you
96:09 think
96:10 and i will say this if you haven't seen
96:11 it in 20 years which is a high
96:13 likelihood
96:14 go re-watch it with your new mind
96:18 and then ask yourself even though it's a
96:19 fictional film one we know predictive
96:21 programming is one of their
96:23 most coveted techniques of
96:26 talking to each other they love to throw
96:29 it in our face
96:30 it also helps us to absorb the absurd
96:34 because we've already seen it once
96:35 before it's not such a shock to the
96:37 system
96:38 when we find ourselves in that system
96:42 but re-watch it again let me know what
96:45 you think
96:47 and if you haven't been to
96:48 deepthoughtsradio.com please go
96:51 please bookmark it just in case crazy
96:53 continues
96:55 we're doing well so far i think at this
96:58 point
96:59 the shadow bending on the channel has
97:01 reached a point where they've pretty
97:02 much capped us
97:03 under 5 000 and they just won't let it
97:06 get over five thousand
97:08 so do me a favor if you dig the show
97:11 promote it somewhere where you think it
97:13 might get absorbed well
97:14 my recommendation is to find an episode
97:16 that contextually addresses what one of
97:18 your friends is talking about
97:20 and say you know what you're just
97:21 talking about this this dude did this
97:23 episode
97:24 he's a weird guy he's in black and white
97:26 that helps him find it by the way
97:28 and say watch this let me know let's
97:31 have a discussion
97:32 but on there we have video audio social
97:35 media
97:36 an all new remastered season one a store
97:40 and uh two places where you can donate
97:43 to the show
97:45 we've had some pretty generous uh paypal
97:48 transfers recently so thank you so much
97:52 in the credits by the way if you go over
97:54 25
97:55 on any method of donation and one one go
97:59 then your color your name is
98:02 it's going to be sorted to the tippy top
98:04 of the credits and you're going to be
98:05 orange-ish kind of
98:07 whatever color it's not orange not going
98:10 to go masonic on you
98:12 but anyway until the next episode take
98:14 care of yourself and someone
98:16 else and i'll see you in the next deep
98:17 thoughts over now
98:32 [Music]
98:38 [Music]

98:50 [Music]
98:55 you
