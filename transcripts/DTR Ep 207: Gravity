00:00 [Music]
00:32 welcome back to detox ladies and
00:34 gentlemen today we're going to talk
00:35 about as you can see a subject that
00:38 maybe some of you have absolutely no
00:39 interest in but let me try to entice you
00:41 here there's a lot of people out there
00:43 that are saying the ignorant [ __ ]
00:45 phrase gravity goes in exuse moon yeah
00:49 all right I want to make a big
00:52 distinction here because we're going to
00:53 go through it we're going to go through
00:55 a lot of different stuff related to
00:57 gravity and I'm not sure it's going to
01:00 last an hour we'll see what we can do
01:02 but a person sitting in the chair will
01:06 say that they they don't believe gravity
01:09 exists and gravity doesn't exist and
01:11 that kind of [ __ ] you're like are you
01:12 [ __ ] kidding me what do you think is
01:15 holding your ass to that chair when you
01:18 get on a weight scale what are you
01:20 measuring I'm going to tell you what
01:22 gravity is today you will know what
01:26 gravity is today and it is not my idea
01:29 it was discovered by absolutely Brainiac
01:32 people and for those of you watch every
01:34 single episode I do apologize this is a
01:36 gigantic repeat from a sort of a
01:41 digression that I go into in various
01:42 episodes but this time around we're
01:44 going to stick with it because that way
01:47 I can just refer to the gravity episode
01:49 and we can move on in future episodes
01:51 I'll have to go through it a bunch of
01:52 times right what people are trying to
01:55 say is that they don't think that we
01:59 understand what gravity is and that what
02:03 they've been told about what gravity is
02:04 they disagree with that is what they're
02:07 really trying to say when they say well
02:10 gravity doesn't exist if you say gravity
02:12 does
02:13 you have nothing you don't have the
02:15 previous two kind of insinuations in
02:17 your mind and you have no knowledge of
02:21 science probably of anything at all even
02:24 scientific method of where the [ __ ] you
02:26 are and that's fine you can be
02:28 blissfully ignorant about stuff but if
02:30 you reach the point where your lips need
02:31 to move and you have to say this
02:33 statement gravity doesn't exist then
02:37 you're probably at the point where you
02:38 should have someone explain it to you so
02:40 you can understand what it is and move
02:44 on with life you know at the most
02:48 fundamental level gravity is a force
02:51 right something is exerting force on
02:54 mass which we're going to get into all
02:57 the nuances of what that is because we
02:59 can't just say the basic stuff this will
03:02 all be simple to understand trust me but
03:06 the one reason why gravity has remained
03:09 obvious kated meaning hidden it's true
03:12 beauty is that if you could harness
03:16 force as a human being you could create
03:19 perpetual motor engines it's bad enough
03:22 that in America we stopped doing
03:25 hydroelectric power plants in the early
03:28 70s because the power company said Jesus
03:30 Christ this stuff is free no one's going
03:33 to pay money for something that is
03:34 generally free once they subsidize the
03:37 creation of a dam with turbines in it
03:39 and there's all kinds of cool [ __ ] now
03:41 that doesn't even stop the water it just
03:42 takes advantage of Rapids and shakes it
03:45 we could put these little units on the
03:47 coast of every single beachfront
03:49 property so far out that no surfer is
03:52 going to bump into it so far out that
03:54 you don't to worry about it's low enough
03:55 and the ground is deep enough that no
03:56 ship Jolla will bump into it but the
03:59 second that man can harness force
04:02 because man has a complete understanding
04:04 of gravity because it's going to go out
04:08 of the basic gravity that you and I
04:11 experienced and it's going to excel in
04:13 two models by which we could orchestrate
04:16 the gravity there are big reasons why
04:19 this has been obfuscated but this
04:21 episode right here is going to tell you
04:23 exactly how it works and I'm going to be
04:25 stealing from Eric
04:26 Dollard who steals from all the masters
04:29 of the world right faraday - Tesla's I
04:33 always say when you go to physics and
04:35 high school today
04:38 they say that gravity is a mysterious
04:40 force by which mass pulls on mass wrong
04:46 mass does not pull on mass and never has
04:51 so all of you who've patted yourself on
04:54 the back you got a little bruise for how
04:55 [ __ ] smart you are on your back
04:56 shoulder blade which is none of my
04:58 listeners they're wrong and you're wrong
05:02 don't believe it has nothing to do with
05:04 anything
05:05 the reason why they've been able to
05:06 create this shitty theory and hang on to
05:09 it is that no one thinks beyond the
05:13 basics and all of the literature that
05:16 Eric Dollard has been we oh [ __ ] Eric
05:19 dullard in my opinion so much he
05:22 deserves a [ __ ] bronze statue
05:23 somewhere in the world because he had
05:26 the he had the fortune of growing up
05:29 extremely brilliant and then he had the
05:31 intelligence to do tests and stuff
05:33 that you know proving the fact that he
05:36 could make light he can make an
05:37 electronic circuit on longitudinal
05:39 circuit travel 11 times the speed of
05:40 light in 1988 in a basement you know he
05:44 wouldn't resurrect at all of the the
05:46 books of all the geniuses that really
05:48 discovered electricity to tell us
05:51 exactly what gravity was at all we did
05:55 was we allowed this [ __ ] guy Einstein
05:59 to come into the equation get built up
06:01 just like we do all things into a way
06:05 beyond his intelligence sort of Peter
06:09 Sellers being their [ __ ] guy and then
06:12 he could say anything he could he could
06:14 just be a [ __ ] idiot and say
06:16 something he wasn't an idiot but he
06:18 could say anything and it became law I
06:20 don't know if he's the shill I don't
06:22 know if he's a fake Shakespeare where he
06:24 really isn't a brilliant guy like like
06:26 Peter Sellars and being there and they
06:30 inserted the narrative that got rid of
06:32 all these clues on how we can create for
06:35 you energy systems perpetual motors all
06:37 this good stuff right and I'm bitching a
06:40 little bit
06:40 let me just get out of my system there
06:42 is a fundamental particle in the
06:44 universe it does not require a fabric to
06:48 exist it brings its own payload into the
06:51 infinite void that is the infinite is
06:55 that is our container and it is called
06:58 an ether all particle it has no
07:01 electrical charge electrical charge is a
07:05 higher level concept that is imposed
07:07 upon behaviors of energy right and
07:11 apparently as tests have revealed ether
07:16 appears to be densely everywhere it is
07:20 not infinitely packed right it's not
07:22 packed like you know some salt cube it
07:26 flows it flows like wind in the universe
07:29 it has been tracked several times like
07:32 several people the two most notable
07:35 people that tracked it were about 50
07:36 years apart in age one was Faraday and
07:39 the other one was Tesla and both of them
07:41 tracked it at 50 times the speed of
07:43 light but the behavior of ether is a
07:46 chaotic evenly distributed when
07:50 undisturbed wind particles are flying in
07:54 all directions they probably bounce off
07:56 of each other at some point but at some
08:01 point ether winds create currents for
08:07 those of you who have gone down to a
08:09 river and you look down at a current and
08:11 your relative says you know you're a
08:13 little child and your relative says if
08:15 you ever get into a river be very
08:17 careful about those little vortexes in
08:19 the water you know it looks just like
08:21 your dream you're so your tub drain at
08:23 the end of the drain of all the water in
08:25 your tub right spiraling and they say
08:28 those currents are really strong and
08:30 they can drag you down and drown you now
08:32 if I take you down there today and I
08:34 show you a current in the water and I
08:36 point at it I say what's that then you
08:40 go that's a current and I look at you
08:43 and I go it's actually just water
08:45 it's just water it's behaving in a
08:49 particular manner by which you classify
08:51 as a current but if you put your hand
08:53 into it you're not gonna pull out cotton
08:54 candy you're gonna get wet but because
08:59 of its particular behavior its vortex
09:01 shape it's gained force isn't that
09:05 interesting well if you pick a little
09:06 bit of water up you know put your hand
09:09 in the calm water about ten feet back
09:10 from the current and you put you put it
09:12 in your hand it's just water it's benign
09:14 it does nothing but make you wet
09:16 moisturizes you but you walk up ten feet
09:20 and put your arm in a big current and
09:21 start yanking you down you get in it
09:23 you'll drown potentially right that's
09:26 pretty interesting but what causes a
09:28 current to exist right if water is just
09:31 flowing down a beautiful trough there's
09:33 no currents water bumps into something
09:37 and start spinning it starts creating a
09:39 trajectory just like when you play pool
09:42 and you put the you know the cube stick
09:45 a little bit to the left boom you hit it
09:48 starts Crete in English on that ball
09:49 starts spinning usually there's a rock
09:52 if you go underneath the bridge it's
09:54 usually the suspension beams that are
09:56 holding out the bridge and going into
09:57 the water water spouting off it starts
10:00 twirling because that's what it does it
10:03 starts influencing all the other water
10:05 particles and it starts twirling a
10:07 current as a macro thing it is a
10:10 gigantic collection of God knows how
10:14 many ether particles that are behaving
10:16 in a certain way but you can recognize
10:18 atomic mass quote-unquote as water and
10:22 then you put a behavioral model on it
10:24 and then it's a current you put an
10:27 intellectual model on that and it
10:28 becomes a danger see how that manifests
10:32 up from nothing it's not really nothing
10:34 but it's just fundamental particle but
10:37 this is about gravity but we have to
10:38 understand ether we must bring ether
10:40 back into the classroom it is a thousand
10:43 percent real and it was only theorized
10:46 away by lazy [ __ ] who are working
10:49 for JP Morgan working for energy
10:52 companies that were trying to hide the
10:53 very fundamental fabric of what we have
10:55 as a universe to make sure that you're
10:58 not able to go
10:59 around them you're not able to conceive
11:02 of an antigravity machine because you
11:04 don't understand what gravity is because
11:06 it's been obfuscated hidden we're gonna
11:09 we're going to pierce that veil today
11:11 again I apologize before I go through
11:13 this example again because I've given
11:15 the example dozens of times on various
11:16 shows gravity is nothing more than the
11:21 negative pressure created between two
11:25 objects that I want you to think of
11:27 these objects as currents in your mind
11:28 okay earth is a current it is a
11:33 collection of infinite you know
11:35 seemingly infinite numbers of particles
11:38 that all comprise microcurrents right
11:41 every electron Neutron proton photon
11:44 everything Neutron it's all currents
11:47 that it is the way that the water is
11:49 moving that we classify those currents
11:51 of ether winds as something of a higher
11:55 construct a higher thing you've got a
11:57 bunch of little tiny Legos even if I
11:59 gave you that tinyint the tiny Lego
12:01 right the one that's super duper small
12:04 you'd obviously be able to go in linear
12:06 dimension but if I give you one that's
12:07 got two segments it's only one high one
12:09 wide you can start creating life with
12:12 just that little tiny Lego well that's
12:15 what an ether a particle allows in this
12:17 universe so at all twirls together and
12:20 creates at Earth we are a part of Earth
12:23 the Sun has its own plasma ball and its
12:26 own fusion exterior and it's its own
12:30 object but because the earth and the Sun
12:33 are made of the exact same thing that
12:35 the rest of the universe is made out of
12:37 when the II throw winds fly around the
12:39 universe and they hit their own kind and
12:43 it really just comes down to they hit
12:44 they they hit each other because they
12:48 have the same size right no one really
12:53 knows an ether a particle looks like we
12:54 have to assume that it is as infinitely
12:57 dense as it needs to be to become
13:00 something that you could touch right the
13:02 idea is if you had something that you
13:05 know everyone who buys a really thick
13:06 sweater you could pull it really hard
13:08 for directions and you could drop sand
13:10 beads between the between the threads
13:12 right
13:13 because it's not quite as dense but we
13:14 have to assume that ether particles are
13:16 good enough to bump into each other so
13:18 once that starts occurring which is just
13:20 basic physical model universe okay
13:23 what's beautiful about this is it's a
13:25 physical model that you can put in a
13:26 computer and as soon as you simulate
13:28 ether in the universe you immediately
13:30 see gravity happen immediately and you
13:33 would immediately once you have a little
13:34 bit of gravity you start to have orbital
13:39 behaviors okay
13:42 we start giving you all the
13:44 classifications of energy that we know
13:45 all right
13:46 ether comes at the the Sun from all
13:51 directions evenly from all directions
13:54 but ether is used to being unimpeded
13:56 right it just moves all over the place
13:59 but when it bounces off something a huge
14:02 collection of its own currents all tied
14:05 together and tangled together it starts
14:08 creating there starts to be less ether
14:13 in the universe at a particular location
14:15 because where it would have went from
14:17 point A to point B it stopped at C and
14:19 bounced back to point a and this is best
14:22 illustrated by something you know you
14:23 have done if you're twenty years old
14:25 you've definitely done it you've been in
14:26 a very windy parking lot field sports
14:31 stadium outside it'll be football
14:34 whatever and you have a friend that
14:37 you're walking up against usually as
14:39 someone you're attracted to and it's
14:42 cold usually a little bit but the winds
14:44 blowing you all over the place you know
14:46 and of course you have gravity yanking
14:47 me down you're on your feet but we can
14:48 ignore that particular factor for this
14:50 example but you start walking towards
14:51 each other now ten feet away you don't
14:54 really feel each other
14:55 there's still time when on your chest
14:56 trying to win on your back same thing
14:58 for them when you get within 12 inches
15:00 of each other you now can sense each
15:02 other's presence on a pressure level
15:05 their back is blocking the chaotic wind
15:08 that would normally have hit you in the
15:09 chest and your back is blocking the
15:11 chaotic wind that would normally hit
15:12 them in the chest if you had a pressure
15:14 gauge that was very sensitive and you
15:18 pushed your arm out to your left and you
15:20 took a temperature reading or pressure
15:22 reading of the at ambient wind and air
15:25 pressure
15:26 would be higher than if you put it
15:29 between your chest at say six inches
15:31 when you're six inches apart from your
15:33 mate because you've created a negative
15:36 pressure this is how wings work on jets
15:38 people the shape of a wing creates a
15:40 negative pressure on top of the wings
15:42 such that at a particular speed if you
15:45 put a streamer on the top of the wing
15:47 the funny question they always ask in
15:49 physics is if I tied a bunch of
15:50 streamers to the top of a wing and we
15:52 flew what direction would the streamers
15:54 go and everyone says straight back
15:57 because they see that well no they
16:00 actually go straight up because of the
16:02 design of the wing all right it creates
16:05 a negative pressure on the top of the
16:07 wing that's how flight happens but
16:08 somehow we have our heads up our ass
16:10 when it comes to normal physics of how
16:12 the universe works right what's
16:15 interesting is if someone might split
16:16 the hair go yeah man but you're talking
16:18 about oxygen your piercing oxygen with
16:22 the wing of a plane that's different
16:24 than this fake ether wind stuff you have
16:26 know as it is above so2 is below macro
16:32 emulates micro micro emulates macro
16:36 honestly the wing is a macro the micro
16:40 behavior that is gravity is just
16:42 produced by the smallest unit of mass
16:46 that has ever been identified so let's
16:49 loop back on this because we're going to
16:50 talk about weightlessness and we're
16:53 going to get into these gravity waves
16:55 that they say they've discovered and
16:56 we'll get into Einstein's whole
16:58 spacetime relativity thing which I did
17:00 touch on a recent episode but we're
17:01 going to quickly go by the repeat of a
17:04 recent episode and we will get into some
17:08 of the more detailed stuff that I don't
17:10 talk about let's say that you wanted to
17:13 make a 60-ton rock totally weightless
17:18 it's not inversely affected in that will
17:22 fly up into the air and disappear into
17:24 the sky that's a whole different
17:25 mechanism but let's just say we wanted
17:29 it to be like a balloon with a perfect
17:32 amount of helium in it that it doesn't
17:33 float away it doesn't go up it doesn't
17:35 go down you know it's like when you've
17:36 had a balloon
17:37 from the from the circus or something
17:38 for a week it starts to kind of just
17:40 hover in the air right well we could
17:42 make rocks do that too we could make
17:44 anything do that why is the rock being
17:47 held down gravity is this super weak
17:50 force but somehow there are 60 tonne
17:52 rocks in the world right 100 ton rocks
17:53 the pyramids are made out of 2.3 million
17:56 of these things right the great pyramid
17:59 just by itself the estimates are two
18:03 point three to two point five million
18:04 rocks and goddamn that's phenomenal
18:07 right how do they move all this stuff
18:08 into place
18:09 how'd the Coral Castle build his thing
18:12 alright I'm going to tell you how easy
18:14 it is I'm not going to say and I know
18:16 exactly how it's done perfectly but this
18:19 is the this is the goal that if we were
18:21 to sit down a bunch of scientists this
18:22 is what our goal would be we have to
18:26 resonate the rock somehow so it's that
18:30 the ether o winds that are actually
18:31 slamming into the top of the rock
18:33 without anything slamming against the
18:35 bottom of the rock because earth is
18:37 blocking the wind that would come up to
18:39 the bottom so if we could balance the
18:41 amount of ether winds that that we're
18:44 pressing on top of the rock and the same
18:46 you throw in to push on the bottom we
18:49 get that thing to be floating in the air
18:51 now yes there are factors that are the
18:54 oxygen pressure and all that kind of
18:56 stuff but I will tell you the reason why
18:58 that's being held to this most likely
19:00 heliocentric ball is because the ball is
19:03 blocking what would normally be pushing
19:05 up and keeping it equally floating in
19:07 space right if we could just get the
19:10 ether winds to go through then the ether
19:13 winds would have no effect on the
19:15 vortexes of ether all mass that exists
19:18 that makes the rock visible to us right
19:21 it has been a heavy suspicion of mind
19:24 that the way the Coral Castle guy was
19:26 able to move his rocks around and I
19:29 think this is perhaps and he said that
19:30 he figured out how they move the rocks
19:32 back in the pyramid days is if you take
19:35 a rock and you resonate it you vibrate
19:37 it with electricity at a particular
19:40 frequency you are going to be able to
19:43 allow the rock to breathe and it will
19:47 become permeable
19:49 - ether wins meaning the ether winds
19:51 will go through it more than it bounces
19:54 off and then it loses its weight it
19:59 loses enough of its weight that's all
20:00 you need is enough of its weight that
20:02 you could push it around with some
20:03 strong guys the Coral Castle guy was 110
20:06 pounds people and yet he built this
20:09 frickin castle out of coral rock from 30
20:15 to 60 tons a rock
20:18 it took cranes to put on the back
20:20 flatbed trucks the truck would be driven
20:22 up to his facility made the guys go
20:24 around the corner while he pulled the
20:25 rocks off by himself they would leave he
20:28 had them in place the next morning and
20:30 he used pulleys to kind of just do some
20:31 final adjustments but the rock always
20:34 had this mysterious brown box attached
20:36 to it which had wires that went into
20:38 this little warehouse where he had this
20:40 crank wheel which creates electricity
20:42 with magnets it was all based on some
20:45 very specific frequencies and there's
20:47 been some great documentaries that map a
20:48 lot of his symbology in his castle to
20:51 the sonic lodges and some of the Mason
20:54 ideas that maybe this was a something
20:58 that someone figured out through
20:59 serendipitous may be using meridians out
21:02 of the earth and figuring out the
21:04 electricity did come out of the bowels
21:05 of the earth and created this this
21:07 bleeding of ether Oh winds out of the
21:10 surface of the earth and when they push
21:11 a rock over this crevice it became
21:13 weightless and as the radiant shift
21:15 underneath the earth because the plasma
21:18 core shifts and the tectonic plates do
21:20 kind of break apart and let the stuff
21:22 out and there's that it's gone they were
21:25 able to say well remember when the power
21:28 was coming out of the earth and made the
21:30 rocks weightless we can simulate power
21:34 we can channel power we just got to
21:36 figure out what frequency makes
21:38 particular materials weightless now I do
21:41 think that the the catch with the
21:43 pyramids and the Coral Castle is that
21:45 limestone and granite rock were
21:49 susceptible to this technique and coral
21:52 rock was obviously it's extremely porous
21:54 rock it probably has the same principle
21:57 it is susceptible to electrical
21:59 stimulation with sacred geometry
22:02 frequency's you know when you put sand
22:05 on top of a black rectangle and you
22:07 vibrate it with sound it starts making
22:09 beautiful shapes okay you can do that
22:11 invisibly on a rock potentially right
22:14 all they're doing is making sure that
22:17 the ether winds that are trying to
22:18 bounce off of the currents that do make
22:22 up the rock no longer have compatibility
22:26 because he's taken the currents that are
22:28 the energy cycles of electrons neutrons
22:30 and protons inside this thing and he's
22:33 shaking it in such a way that the ether
22:34 winds pass through it and it becomes
22:38 weightless Faraday was quoted as saying
22:42 after I believe 40 years of research but
22:45 he was not able to figure out what ether
22:47 all particles are but he said I don't
22:51 need to know how and why a steak dinner
22:54 tastes good I can just eat it and enjoy
22:56 it so he goes I would have preferred to
22:59 have figured out what he throw winds are
23:01 well you throw particles are but I don't
23:02 really need to figure it out I can just
23:04 obey and build physical models and
23:08 machinery based on my knowledge of it
23:11 now no one contests the brilliance of
23:14 Nikola Tesla I will eventually do an
23:17 episode on him 100% I'm going to Episode
23:19 on Eric Dollard as well Nikola Tesla
23:23 measured it proved that it exists and
23:27 then Einstein who is a you know we have
23:33 to give him potentially some credit here
23:35 but you know the only thing I design is
23:37 really credited with is the atomic bomb
23:40 and it is it is actually pretty well
23:46 asserted that you know he was a patsy
23:48 for the blame game on the nuclear bomb
23:51 and that it wasn't necessarily his
23:53 equals mc-squared thing that actually
23:55 jostled everyone's belief system into
23:57 energy as mass and masses energy I think
24:00 it was well understood before he wrote
24:01 it down he just happened to create a big
24:05 flawed formula that actually ended with
24:08 that assertion because his formula
24:11 doesn't allow anything to travel faster
24:13 Istria light it is not
24:14 rekt hell according to him a photon
24:17 can't even [ __ ] exist it's ridiculous
24:20 but let's talk about these gravity waves
24:24 gravity waves technically being
24:26 discovered is sort of a lowbrow
24:28 discovery I mean it is for me you know
24:32 I've heard this repeated over and over
24:34 and over again by really brilliant
24:35 friends of my weekend hope they've
24:36 discovered gravity waves like yeah so
24:40 what the [ __ ] is that
24:42 it's a quantified stream of gravity
24:45 waves of a force that is the weakest
24:47 force in the universe that holds it all
24:48 together I mean you know we see gravity
24:50 all the time I got gravity waves on my
24:52 pants for [ __ ] sake right big deal but
24:57 then what they try to do is say because
24:59 personai said gravity waves are going to
25:02 exist you will discover them some point
25:04 anything else person a theorized is true
25:09 imagine someone's racist and they come
25:12 up some scientific theories to things
25:13 that are completely [ __ ] unrelated to
25:15 each other the way we run science today
25:18 well then then I guess whatever
25:21 assertions they want to make about a
25:22 particular race are true because
25:24 everything else they said was true
25:25 they're so smart right gravity waves
25:29 exist regardless of what anyone thinks
25:31 gravity is but the ether particle model
25:35 of the universe is absolutely perfect it
25:39 is that truth with a capital T it is
25:42 flawlessly possible to simulate this in
25:46 a computer if you had enough memory to
25:48 hold a bunch of particles it is a
25:49 hundred thousand percent capable being
25:54 modeled and the beautiful thing is it
25:56 doesn't really have any notion of
25:58 positive electron charges those are just
26:02 behaviors that are being classified now
26:05 the only mystery we have which is sort
26:08 of a chicken and egg mystery with the
26:10 universe in general is to say if you had
26:12 this container of some sort where you
26:16 have ether particles swimming around in
26:18 a chaotic wind and again you're the one
26:22 question we have to ask is if it was an
26:25 infinite container why wouldn't all the
26:26 ether particles diffuse
26:28 infinitely and just start swimming away
26:30 from each other you know eventually
26:32 that's a theory for another day and what
26:34 I'm trying to work on right now I'm not
26:35 trying to work on it I am working on it
26:37 right now I will share once I figure out
26:39 the best possible way to explain it a
26:41 gravity wave is nothing more than a
26:44 quantified meaning a captured part of
26:48 the universe where we simply measure the
26:51 effects of gravity that's it it's it's
26:56 tantamount to saying okay we're going to
26:59 look in that river with that current
27:01 it's got force it's just water that's
27:03 moving in a particular way and we
27:04 recognize that for us as a current and
27:06 the particular argument of gravity waves
27:08 we're simply saying II throw particles
27:10 move in a particular current that
27:12 creates force that is so recognizable
27:15 that we call it gravity because it's
27:17 helping to construct things in the
27:19 universe that we can recognize with our
27:21 eyeballs right but it's as if we could
27:24 take a kind of a shoebox snapshot or a
27:26 cubic snapshot of the water that's in
27:28 that river creating that current and we
27:30 point down at what we look at and we're
27:32 saying look see that current little
27:34 tornado of water that's a gravity wave
27:38 honestly it is a current is a gravity
27:40 wave somehow it means more to the
27:43 scientific community if they can find it
27:44 on a more macro scale in the universe
27:46 but it's sort of absurd we can see it
27:49 down here anybody who's doing you know
27:53 tests for aerodynamics you're looking at
27:57 gravity waves people turbulence there's
27:59 nothing more than a sub classification
28:02 of gravity thermal dynamics it's all
28:05 based on you know my new classifications
28:08 very specific classifications of gravity
28:10 and how various particles which are made
28:12 of currents of ether ol energy
28:15 manipulate each other and bounce off of
28:17 each other it's very important it's
28:19 extremely important that we understand
28:21 how these things work if we're going to
28:22 achieve flight we're going to make an f1
28:24 car go one mile an hour faster on
28:26 average it's all important if we want to
28:30 protect ourselves from tornadoes bill
28:32 tornado-proof houses well we'd have to
28:34 know how tornado tries to rip [ __ ] apart
28:36 so we can build structures that can
28:38 fight those forces and make them moot
28:40 but Einstein had the
28:42 this pool table remember the pool table
28:45 back in the 70s and early 80s where they
28:48 had painted this beautiful grid on it
28:49 and they put this ball in the middle
28:51 which is uh you know the Sun sometimes
28:53 they don't put the ball in there and it
28:54 just has a vortex down like a current
28:57 and they roll that cue ball or whatever
29:00 and it goes in this circle and
29:02 eventually kind of you know it becomes
29:05 subservient to the curvature of the
29:07 table and then goes down the chute of
29:09 course while that experiments happening
29:10 the II throw gravity is actually pushing
29:12 on the table itself your problem with
29:15 air pressure being purely gravity
29:17 soliciting for the flat earthers and I
29:19 sort of spoke too quickly in one of my
29:21 episodes about Flat Earth and didn't
29:23 really put this together because I'd
29:24 seen experiments that kind of proved
29:25 that the situation is that when you
29:28 remove all the air from a chamber like a
29:30 glass box and you put a feather in there
29:33 and a paperclip you know with oxygen in
29:36 there the feather falls a little slower
29:37 when you turn it upside down the
29:39 paperclip falls real quick because the
29:41 paperclip is more dense it has more
29:44 gravity pushing on it but air starts to
29:47 play games with the you know the lack of
29:51 gravity pushing on a feather it weighs
29:52 less right the feather weighs less than
29:54 the paperclip and so you can immediately
29:56 tell the paperclip is disturbing more
29:59 ether winds and therefore is heavier the
30:01 feather doesn't but then the feather has
30:03 an added extra obstruction which is the
30:06 thickness of air
30:07 once you vacuum it all out they tend to
30:09 fall at the exact same rate up and down
30:11 when you keep rotating the cage
30:12 well what's making it fall if there is
30:15 air pressure is all of gravity its ether
30:19 winds because II throw winds will go
30:20 right through the roof of the building
30:22 right through the glass and it will bang
30:25 into the currents of the energy that do
30:26 make up the feather and the paper clip
30:28 for anyone who's played marbles it's
30:31 very interesting who knows the exact
30:34 shape of an ether particle but you sort
30:36 of have the fundamental understanding of
30:38 what an ether a particle system is now
30:41 if a particle can hit a particle you
30:43 have a very interesting physical model
30:46 that immediately shows up in your mind
30:47 you have a ricochet and once you have a
30:51 ricochet you start getting current
30:56 nobody really knows how dense ether
30:58 particles are probably Faraday and Tesla
31:00 did I do not have that information at
31:01 this point in my life it's pretty dense
31:05 but it's obviously not some sort of
31:07 sludge like we don't walk around the
31:09 world kind of feeling like we're walking
31:11 through water but when you're in water
31:12 all of a sudden you feel that sludge you
31:14 know if we were to build a baby pool out
31:17 of honey
31:18 that's three feet deep and you try to
31:20 walk them even harder right the more
31:23 that the substrate that you're moving
31:25 through is dense and also can reflect
31:28 and deflect and ricochet ether all winds
31:31 the more it becomes a inhibiting force
31:34 for you as well for anything that tries
31:37 to move through it we see it all the
31:38 time remember light refracts through
31:41 water that means water is dense enough
31:43 that even a photon which is probably a
31:47 verbal reaction of ether all winds of
31:49 ether 'el fabric it bends but it has
31:55 such a forward momentum that it doesn't
31:57 wiggle around like a vein inside the
31:59 water it just basically bends its vector
32:01 once it starts hitting that substrate it
32:03 alternates the vibrational frequency of
32:06 the photon in a very consistent way and
32:08 that it goes in a new direction but if
32:12 we were to be able to build a pool of
32:14 water out of various salts right where
32:17 you have salts going to float on the top
32:18 you know they put it inside them sort of
32:21 pools that are used for physical therapy
32:23 so people float more it might Bend one
32:27 way through the really salty water and
32:29 then as soon as it hits more pure water
32:31 down below it might Bend again because
32:33 each one of them is going to have a
32:34 different effect on the overall
32:36 frequency of the verb that is a photon
32:38 so let's move on to some more
32:40 interesting stuff about gravity if you
32:43 can understand for a second that gravity
32:45 is nothing more than a throw winds being
32:47 obstructed then all of a sudden you can
32:49 start doing experiments now the way that
32:53 I've been told by Eric Dollard that II
32:55 throw winds are discovered is that you
32:56 take a big long wire to be it needs to
33:00 be like six feet to 12 feet long like an
33:03 antenna off your car and moving that
33:06 through the oxygen and
33:08 a room you're able to feel the
33:11 electrical disturbances in the wire and
33:13 pick up
33:14 II throw winds again Tesla was so had so
33:19 proven that ether exists okay
33:22 he created the Tesla tower from 1917 to
33:24 1927 and drew power out of the [ __ ]
33:29 thin air which is all full of ether
33:32 right when JP Morgan said what are you
33:36 doing he said well this is the most
33:37 amazing thing we can grab power out of
33:39 the sky and then I can use my Tesla
33:41 coils but you know every time a coil
33:43 wire goes around it doubles the power of
33:45 the original coil of the previous quo
33:48 and so he could coiled it down to give
33:50 it some substance threw it into the
33:52 bowels of the earth and drew up from the
33:54 bowels of the earth part of the plasma
33:56 stream that is at the center of the
33:58 earth and created infinite power boom
34:01 that's exactly what the pyramids did in
34:04 Egypt using conductive limestone on the
34:07 center of a pyramid and non-conductive
34:09 limestone on the outside and use red
34:12 granite and all of the caverns that
34:14 people walked in to stream it outside
34:16 and down into the the the plateau which
34:22 was you know classified as being taller
34:25 than the pyramids themselves the Great
34:27 Pyramid is about 455 feet tall that's a
34:31 [ __ ] don'ts like almost 50 stories high
34:33 but the foundation it's on is supposedly
34:37 taller and that that mirrors exactly
34:40 what we do with our skyscrapers and when
34:42 we pile drive big giant beams into the
34:44 ground when the soil is not so sturdy
34:46 the mathematics is if you're going to
34:48 build a ten story building you drive ten
34:50 story pylons into the ground and one
34:54 sits on top of the other and it a ver
34:56 ajiz the tilt and the weight
34:57 distribution on the surface it's exactly
35:01 what they did with the pyramids and the
35:02 plateau is full of honeycomb chambers
35:05 that carry water so they could move the
35:08 power around the plateau and if you
35:09 needed water you just put a stick in the
35:11 ground that was conductive and you could
35:13 bring power straight out and light a
35:14 light bulb so anywhere in Egypt while
35:16 the Giza Plaza please a plateau
35:19 you could get power you get lights
35:21 that's why the pyramids don't have any
35:23 you know torch marks on the walls
35:25 because they could just turn on power
35:26 anywhere they were that's how Tesla was
35:30 able to fill his laboratory with light
35:31 without having light bulbs you've had
35:35 ionized plasma gas most likely and his
35:39 ceiling and somehow he could control its
35:41 creation and consumption into probably
35:44 thermal light energy energy in such a
35:46 way it was safe for everyone in the room
35:47 oh I didn't hit any of his equipment
35:51 have a power cable in the wall because
35:55 he just projected the power directly
35:56 into the unit he just needed to
35:59 oscillate ether in such a way that it
36:03 stimulated the conductive surface of all
36:06 of his circuits prevent the perhaps of
36:07 his power sources again all of his [ __ ]
36:09 was confiscated because no one was
36:13 allowed to know how this dude walked
36:14 right around the power companies but
36:17 let's say that we did understand that
36:18 II throw winds are gravity then I mean
36:25 especially if you started learning that
36:26 in grade school what you should because
36:28 a grade school kid could understand this
36:29 [ __ ] once you draw a diagram on the
36:31 board then we could start thinking about
36:35 all right we're not quite sure exactly
36:38 what East where particles are just like
36:40 Faraday said but we don't have to we can
36:42 manipulate and figure out methodologies
36:44 to change its behavior at any one point
36:47 in time what happens if you could build
36:50 a little machine that could use maybe
36:55 electromagnetic fields electric Mag
36:58 electromagnetism excuse me to manipulate
37:01 the field of energy around a particular
37:03 unit what does that have to do with
37:07 gravity hmm well if everything's made of
37:10 the same stuff and that's pretty much a
37:12 certainty in the universe no matter who
37:13 you're talking to if it's all made of
37:16 some fundamental particle and you're
37:19 manipulating anything in the universe at
37:21 all especially in some sort of current
37:23 right you're creating some sort of force
37:26 fields of energy around a particular
37:28 object and you are starting to play with
37:30 the interaction of the
37:32 II throw winds with the mass that's
37:34 inside the field I saw a video a long
37:38 time ago
37:39 rod more than 10 years ago on YouTube
37:41 technically probably about 12 years when
37:43 I really started waking up but I wasn't
37:45 really I wasn't aware of ether all
37:47 theories I had discovered air Dollard
37:50 but it looked like and I've said this
37:52 several times on the show this is one of
37:54 the major sources there was a there was
37:56 someone who created a documentary
37:58 collage if you will a montage if you
38:02 will of lectures that have been given
38:05 from about 1960 to about 1965 66
38:10 somewhere in there where professors in
38:12 every major university were illustrating
38:16 to their students how we could
38:17 theoretically create anti-gravity
38:19 machines and it all dealt with the
38:24 manipulation of electromagnetic fields
38:27 why electromagnetic fields well it's one
38:30 of the things that is pretty easy to
38:32 create I mean we're not going to be
38:33 talking about the efficiency of energy
38:35 being used we have to put a lot more
38:36 energy in then is going to be
38:39 monetizable by what you create right you
38:42 mean you could move a rock from say you
38:44 know the back of your backyard to the
38:47 front of your backyard or front yard
38:48 excuse me by using energy but you may
38:51 take you know gigawatts to do it so it's
38:53 not feasible in our maybe layman's take
38:56 on the whole thing but that's not
38:58 important yet we can make it more
38:59 efficient later we might be able to find
39:02 better ways of manipulating the ether
39:05 ones around an object at a later date
39:08 using better techniques right but what
39:13 happens if the earth / the humans on
39:16 earth start gaining full control over
39:19 gravity and what if we can flip the bit
39:24 and make it economical now I'm going to
39:27 get into Stan Myers at a different
39:28 episode he's used hydrogen out of tap
39:30 water to achieve great methodologies of
39:33 creating energy for virtually nothing
39:34 again this is not an exercise in trying
39:37 to create you know a sustainable model
39:41 just yet but this is to get it reignite
39:44 hopefully you're thinking such that you
39:45 can make
39:46 get down that path right we ship a lot
39:49 of things in the world right well what
39:53 if you could ship things around the
39:54 world with anti-gravity put them on some
39:56 skid just like Boba Fett it was trying
39:59 to take stealing consoles frozen body
40:02 Carbonite block yeah looks pretty cool
40:05 right that little you know skitter
40:08 whatever the hell they call it that sand
40:11 vehicle that obi-wan Kenobi and Luke
40:13 Skywalker used to get from point A to
40:15 point B haulin ass on the desert floor
40:18 pretty cool right people with spinal
40:22 injuries that can't walk well what are
40:25 they fighting they're fighting gravity
40:27 gravity wants to yank them to the ground
40:29 what if we could strategically
40:31 manipulate their body such that they had
40:34 they only weight as much as their legs
40:36 could take the physical therapy could be
40:38 this amazing thing to say well we're
40:39 going to put you in this bodysuit make
40:43 you damn near weightless and as you move
40:46 around the room you know overtime will
40:49 reduce the amount of anti-gravity that's
40:51 around your body
40:52 hopefully not disturbing your DNA and
40:53 all that good stuff and you can
40:54 manipulate your muscles back into health
40:58 exactly tailored to what your injury
41:00 requires let's say you know we don't
41:03 seem to work on any stem-cell research
41:05 and so this is the only way you're ever
41:07 going to walk it just has to be the way
41:09 it is the benefits of anti-gravity is
41:13 actually pretty phenomenal but one of
41:15 the biggest ones is that we could avoid
41:19 things I hate you could get out of
41:24 harm's way we wouldn't be stuck in
41:27 traffic buying oil if we could attach
41:30 the machines that create the
41:31 anti-gravity run a vehicle then we could
41:33 have computers move us from point A to
41:35 point B and nearly split seconds but we
41:39 aren't there anymore are we we don't
41:41 talk about this anymore do we because
41:43 one scientist said a long time ago that
41:45 a third ether doesn't exist it didn't
41:49 really offer jack [ __ ] for proof his ego
41:52 made him do it at the most fundamental
41:56 level
41:58 but I would contest that perhaps those
42:01 who watch Tesla damn near destroy the
42:04 energy market which is a multi trillion
42:06 dollar market right oil electricity
42:08 right what I have found difficult in
42:13 explaining gravity to other people is
42:14 that we have so many slots in our mind
42:17 right when I was a kid they made
42:19 telephone number seven digits long
42:20 because they determined that the human
42:22 mind has a an innate ability to memorize
42:27 seven individual symbols at once
42:29 associated with a master symbol meaning
42:32 your name's John and I am trying to
42:36 member your phone number I don't
42:37 remember the area code because we didn't
42:39 travel as much back in the day we didn't
42:40 have pagers [ __ ] up all the area
42:43 codes running out of phone numbers we
42:44 didn't have cell phones giving every
42:47 single individual human being its own
42:49 telephone number so it was easy and
42:52 because you lived in a small town or
42:54 whatever town you lived in your area
42:56 code was always the same and your prefix
42:58 was usually the same and all you really
43:00 had to kind of memorize was the last
43:02 four digits when you try to get people
43:06 to imagine in their mind this notion
43:10 that everything is nothing more than
43:12 orbital patterns right vectors slash
43:16 vortex and slash currents of the same
43:19 exact stuff again a current is made of
43:23 water ether is the water current as any
43:26 designation you want to give to whatever
43:29 you're looking at right to break it down
43:31 even further this just just occurred to
43:33 me
43:34 you've gone to the probably a rushing
43:37 river and there's you know there's
43:39 Whitecaps and someone will talk to each
43:42 other well how's the river today oh it's
43:44 great man the Whitecaps are great
43:45 they're not too big not too small and so
43:48 you're also taking water that is hitting
43:50 an object frothing up some oxygen in it
43:52 creating a lot of bubbles that turns
43:53 white and we call that white caps we
43:55 want to talk about the surf on the edge
43:58 of the coast we don't want a lot of
44:00 white caps we want just beautiful
44:01 crashing waves and we have waves what
44:05 are waves
44:06 well there's little waves there's little
44:07 bumpy waves there's gigantic pipes in
44:09 Hawaii that are 50s
44:11 hundred feet tall and we try to get on
44:14 surfboards fiberglass currents and we
44:17 ride the water currents at all the times
44:20 any way you can classify water in any
44:23 way shape or form you are engaging in
44:25 the exact intellectual scientific
44:27 process that we need to use for ether
44:29 ether is the most fundamental water in
44:32 the universe it is not as dense as water
44:35 it is not as easy to hold in your hand
44:37 as water but it is nonetheless what
44:41 everything is made out of the other sort
44:45 of stipulation with the way that we view
44:46 mass is that we think of things in
44:48 quantifiable packets like atoms you know
44:51 if I said Neutron virtually every
44:54 scientist in the world thinks of it as a
44:56 ball of energy a sphere an electron is
45:01 always portrayed as a sphere of negative
45:03 energy to my knowledge the only esoteric
45:06 demand we have in conceptual physics is
45:08 a photon because it was theorized by
45:11 Newton to be a particle and then it was
45:13 later proven to be behaving more like a
45:15 wave which is why the shadows on the
45:17 ground of my patio our furry at the
45:19 edges whoopty do whoopty do could be a
45:25 particle that moves in a wave you never
45:28 hear that theory but you you get the
45:30 sense that you've actually engaged in
45:32 the exact intellectual process and the
45:35 scientific demands that it will take to
45:37 understand the entire universe but
45:40 everything out there is just a bunch of
45:42 orbiting ether particles that
45:45 serendipitously most likely came about
45:47 due to their serendipitous collision
45:49 with each other creating all these
45:50 various minut currents that eventually
45:54 coalesce to create what we are today now
45:58 I'm not talking about I'm leaving out
46:01 the notion of who did it I'm leaving out
46:05 the notion of where it all came from
46:06 that is for you to philosophically
46:07 decide for yourself right whether or not
46:10 there's a central consciousness on a
46:12 different plane that's manipulating this
46:14 stuff or whether or not you know it's
46:18 full evolution something from nothing
46:20 idea you know I'll throw you about a
46:23 very existential
46:24 concept that you can if you're if you're
46:27 having a problem problem ingesting what
46:29 I'm saying right now not on a technical
46:30 level but on a spiritual level think
46:32 about it this way this is going to be
46:35 counterintuitive based on the
46:37 indoctrination that you have had to this
46:38 date but what if ether particles are
46:40 nothing more than the actual particle
46:42 that is consciousness and so God a
46:49 centralized consciousness of the
46:50 universe merely thinking things into
46:52 creation the substrate of his
46:54 consciousness is the eco particle and so
46:57 when he says let there be light he
47:00 controls that [ __ ] he creates the
47:02 reaction that is a photon could be even
47:05 subliminal to God he just feels it and
47:07 thinks it into happens and all of the
47:09 the details of what his thought is his
47:12 autonomic to him just happens I won't
47:16 belabor that but that just will give you
47:17 a little bit of an idea of how
47:18 existential this whole thing could be my
47:22 only frustration with the soul theory is
47:23 I didn't understand it a long time ago
47:25 when I wasted 10-15 years of my life
47:28 developing unified theories of my own
47:30 teaching my child that you know gravity
47:33 was mass pulling against mass and how
47:35 much of a mystery that was I completely
47:36 [ __ ] my kid on accident because I
47:39 didn't have a better model of the whole
47:41 thing a more simple model it's totally
47:43 simple to understand I have friends that
47:46 claim that they have friends like I
47:49 would say close what I call my closest
47:51 family friends I'm not related to them
47:53 but they are famous in technical ways
48:00 you know not just for building computers
48:03 really fast but really technical matters
48:05 and they have been approached by friends
48:08 who are fans of theirs and taken them to
48:11 dinner and they are supposedly a very
48:14 deep projects in governmental research
48:17 and they have said on many claims and
48:22 this is what's interesting to me because
48:24 listening to the conversation to me it
48:26 almost sounds like someone's
48:27 bullshitting my buddy but the assertion
48:30 is that you know the United States
48:33 government at least in its military you
48:36 know groups probably sort of a
48:38 maybe an area 51's for Los Alamos labs
48:41 wright-patterson Air Force Base whatever
48:43 that they have developed anti-gravity
48:45 capabilities consequently I do not
48:48 believe there's any claim of ripping it
48:50 off from alien spacecraft but everything
48:54 that Bob Lazar talked about about
48:56 anti-gravity actually maps and mirrors
48:58 the ether model 100% we'll get into that
49:02 before I close out here but he has said
49:06 that the it's funny because the marvel
49:09 sci-fi for Ironman is actually an
49:12 externalization of a project that was
49:14 actually done which is taking mercury
49:16 and you know electrifying it and putting
49:19 it in sort of a spinning vessel and
49:24 because it when it spins and it carries
49:26 a charge in a very three-dimensional
49:27 manner because it is mercury it is able
49:30 to create an antigravity situation now
49:32 supposedly they've moved way past that
49:34 long time ago which is why that can be
49:37 pushed into science fiction and a movie
49:39 but in the end all they're talking about
49:43 doing is creating an electromagnetic
49:44 field that can be manipulated in such a
49:46 way that things become ant weightless
49:49 that are attached to it or encapsulated
49:50 within it it's very fascinating now Bob
49:55 Lazar if you're not familiar with him he
49:58 is the gentleman that was very famous in
50:01 the late 80s early 90s for saying that
50:03 he worked at s4 and worked on one of
50:06 nine recovered UFOs
50:09 I've watched Bob Lazar as I've said
50:12 several times and very shows I've
50:13 watched him in many lectures talking for
50:16 45 minutes to an hour plus and I with my
50:19 knowledge I've not but not been able to
50:21 discern much that seemed that
50:23 interesting but the one thing that he
50:25 repeats all the time is essentially how
50:27 the internals of the particular craft
50:29 that he worked on which is a
50:30 saucer-shaped craft that has no damage
50:33 on it whatsoever
50:34 he said there's other ones that look
50:36 like they've been hit by missiles look
50:37 like they've crashed into Mountains or
50:39 whatever because the money works on is
50:41 as pristine as as any of them they've
50:43 ever recovered
50:46 he said that what they've been trying to
50:47 do is reverse-engineer meaning figure
50:49 out how the hell these engines work
50:51 inside this disk now even if the guy's
50:54 bullshitting he's very very creative and
50:57 seems to be really right in line with
50:59 what an ether ol motor would be inside
51:02 of a vehicle but according to him and
51:06 you can look this guy up there are three
51:08 to four units I think it's three though
51:10 is a triangle formation in the base of
51:12 this saucer where these sort of these
51:15 canisters these sort of cylindrical
51:17 canisters are hanging from these
51:19 actuated arms that can be moved and
51:21 inside this thing but the size of the
51:24 large beehive is the antimatter motor
51:27 according to him again that may be a
51:29 guess you know but part of the theory of
51:33 antimatter is that if you can create a
51:35 motor of antimatter where you can
51:37 actually contain antimatter and not lose
51:39 it and you could move mass between the
51:43 state of mass and antimatter an
51:44 antimatter the conversion between the
51:46 two releases a tremendous amount of an
51:48 exhaustible energy and then you can
51:50 harvest that to do things that are way
51:52 beyond our capacity with you know your
51:54 average decent you know the sized
51:57 Duracell battery right but he said that
52:00 the way that the craft works is that
52:01 these hanging pods lean that they turn
52:05 and they lean and they point in a
52:06 particular direction all in unison and
52:08 that they point towards the direction in
52:11 which they want the ship to go and he
52:15 has described that they create what's
52:16 called a gravity bubble and it creates a
52:19 negative pressure where there is no
52:20 gravity and the ship following the path
52:23 of least resistance will simply fall
52:25 into this this wave in front of the ship
52:28 it's almost like a surfer right now when
52:32 I came up with my unified theory back in
52:33 the 90s it was based on wave theory and
52:36 creating these sort of graduated energy
52:41 waves in the universe which seems like
52:44 it is sort of similar to this but it's a
52:46 little less it's a little less wavy but
52:48 this technique creates a way that the
52:51 ship rides on indefinitely well that
52:55 would be an antigravity motor according
52:58 to him doesn't really have to be but
52:59 to say it is creating a electromagnetic
53:05 field in front of the ship easily
53:08 piercing the the actual metal of the
53:10 ship disturbing and basically forcing
53:15 the ether out of the way and saying
53:17 there's a air pocket let's just say a
53:19 void pocket of ether meaning there is no
53:22 ether in that pocket or I would say a
53:25 lot less than the rest of the
53:26 surrounding area and it goes pop right
53:31 into that spot and the assertion is
53:35 basically that you could create this
53:36 wave keep it going for a really long
53:39 time and the ship would just continually
53:40 build up speed now whether or not the
53:43 ship tops out at a particular velocity
53:44 who the hell knows that's up for theory
53:46 but what's interesting is what he is
53:49 saying completely mirrors 100% the
53:52 knowledge of ether winds all right now
53:55 they say that gravity is the weakest
53:57 force that we know of in the universe
54:00 at least one of them and so some people
54:04 go well if they say it's so weak then
54:05 how the hell did we held down on planet
54:07 earth the reason is is the earth is so
54:10 massive compared to our size get the
54:13 amount of u-thor winds that it blocks
54:14 from the bottom of the earth or we're
54:16 sitting right now I'm you know like on
54:18 the other side of the planet that what
54:20 is left pushing me down does not crush
54:22 me doesn't squish me like a bug this is
54:25 it what I feel right now is the
54:27 combination of all the surface surface
54:29 elements above me which is oxygen and
54:31 various other chemicals above me being
54:33 pushed down by the ether and pushing me
54:36 to the ground honestly you know exactly
54:38 how weak the forces just sit down and
54:41 feel the pressure on the top of your
54:42 body that's exactly how powerful it is
54:45 when you displace it this much now if
54:48 you take the earth and you double its
54:50 size you're going to get squashed
54:52 because now the amount of ether winds
54:55 pushing on you is now much more intense
54:58 now the other thing we need to make a
55:00 distinction on is this notion that
55:02 supposedly the earth
55:03 even if you adopt you throw winds that
55:07 it somehow is absolute in its blockage
55:10 maybe it is maybe it's not maybe I'll
55:13 of ether does penetrate the earth
55:14 through ricocheting off its core and we
55:17 do have this phantom force pushing up
55:19 and we've definitely track that many
55:21 many times in science there is a special
55:23 force that goes up against gravity and
55:25 that might be the little bit of leakage
55:27 through the earth or that may be the
55:29 effect of what happens at the center of
55:31 an atom or the dielectric wave bounces
55:34 off the core of an atom it's the
55:36 magnetic orbit wave and we get
55:39 electromagnetism
55:40 right people like to assert for Flat
55:43 Earth and you know when you hear it it
55:46 sounds romantic and then I hear it
55:47 repeated by people and I'm like it would
55:49 be nice for me to hear someone say this
55:52 theory and then have an additional
55:55 scientific theory that compensates for
55:58 this ether wind which I think is
56:00 undeniably the truth when they say that
56:03 water cannot bend water always seeks a
56:07 level no it doesn't it absolutely does
56:14 not seek a level it seeks unification
56:18 with the force that is pushing on it
56:21 that is what you're seeing so when
56:25 someone says there's no way that you
56:26 know that the water doesn't fly off
56:28 earth well yeah of course the earth
56:32 doesn't spend fast enough to throw the
56:33 oceans off because it would have to spin
56:36 so quickly that it's going to counteract
56:38 the actual ether all force on the earth
56:41 but here's the thing this this thing
56:43 wasn't made in a day all right and if it
56:46 was it was made 100% the way it is and
56:49 therefore it's completely balanced if
56:50 you're biblically you know bound our
56:53 predispositions but if you're willing to
56:55 let God create things with science water
56:59 can be grabbed and pushed down to any
57:01 shape that the object is now planets are
57:05 round okay because that is the what
57:09 happens when you equally push on dynamic
57:12 mass dirt soil chemicals of all kinds
57:16 from all sides due to this you know this
57:20 current that is creating this blockage
57:22 of ether if Earth was the shape of a
57:26 pair
57:27 we would merely look at you know water
57:31 would be a little bit more dense where
57:33 earth was more capable of blocking ether
57:38 winds where it was less capable of
57:39 blocking ether winds the water would be
57:41 more shallow but it would Bend around
57:45 the shape of a pair it would I think
57:50 those in the know know exactly what
57:53 gravity is if you were say the
57:57 benefactor of control over society and
58:02 let's just focus on the monetization of
58:04 that control
58:05 obviously there's tyrannical control as
58:07 well and you were to educate 20 people
58:12 maybe 50 with the [ __ ] knows a small
58:15 number of people when compared to the
58:17 overall population of the world whatever
58:19 that is and you set them down and you
58:22 say look here's the deal we have to keep
58:25 control over society because have you
58:27 ever seen a you know the video of
58:30 [ __ ] fighting at a Denny's at 2:00
58:33 in the morning
58:34 those are that's the option right we let
58:38 those people do whatever the [ __ ] they
58:41 want and they'll tear down the planet
58:42 it'll be they all become Raiders and
58:45 fallout 4 right the [ __ ] that you
58:47 have to [ __ ] exterminate on the
58:49 planet before you can ever have any
58:50 peace and so this is way more intense
58:54 than us making another trillion dollars
58:56 for our quad quadrillion dollars Swiss
58:58 bank accounts and it's a philosophical
59:02 bias that they have so this is what has
59:04 to happen who knows that that's what
59:06 actually has to happen maybe we could
59:08 all get along right but you take these
59:10 key individuals you educate them up on
59:15 what energy has been sold to the people
59:20 to be a unit of power that must be
59:23 purchased by the people from the
59:26 controlling elite and that's just the
59:29 way it is power companies that are
59:32 subsidized by local tax dollars to be
59:34 constructed or immediately handed over
59:35 to gigantic other guard coal monopolies
59:39 to sell you your power
59:41 there's all this [ __ ] about you know
59:43 how monopolies are not allowed in the
59:45 world but you know what I don't have the
59:47 choice where I buy my power and my power
59:49 is not sanctioned by the government in
59:51 terms of costs so I live within the
59:54 tyrannical model of a monopoly that
59:57 controls all the energy that powers this
59:58 place that powers this camera right now
60:01 right but they tell these individuals
60:04 this is the cover story and this is what
60:06 it really is and your job should they
60:10 could pay these people 100 million
60:12 dollars a year wouldn't be anything to
60:15 the amount of profit they make by
60:17 keeping these people in place but they
60:20 said your job is to oversee the creation
60:23 of academic books you are to look into
60:27 all research centers you are to review
60:29 every single peer-reviewed paper that's
60:31 trying to get into a scientific magazine
60:33 you were to oversee the engineering
60:35 teams of gigantic companies like Toyota
60:37 and who knows what else right that's
60:41 making engines that run things Boeing
60:43 rolls-royce all these people to make jet
60:46 engines and rocket engines and you're to
60:48 enforce the ignorance that we have
60:51 worked so hard to instill on the people
60:56 and everywhere you go in that you know
60:59 these people go in the office complex
61:01 it's got pictures of Oppenheimer and and
61:04 Einstein and all of [ __ ] sellouts
61:07 that helped create the cover story that
61:09 is the [ __ ] understanding of energy
61:11 and the obvious gated phenomenon quote
61:14 unquote of gravity there is a reason why
61:17 you're not taught this as an option
61:19 there's a reason why no options are ever
61:21 taught in school about anything there's
61:23 one way you might find a little bit of
61:26 fluctuation with foreign countries but
61:30 overall there is one way to be smart and
61:33 if you don't follow their pre sanctioned
61:35 technology you cannot achieve an
61:39 academic reward and if that's what you
61:43 care about will [ __ ] then you've got to
61:45 please the crowd and the crowd doesn't
61:47 put a lot of effort into anything
61:48 besides memorizing and repeating
61:50 complete [ __ ]
61:53 this is what's beautiful about the era
61:55 that we're in we're in the probably one
61:58 of the first Renaissance moments in
62:00 history where we are capable of waking
62:05 up in every single sector of thought
62:07 from spiritual thought to scientific
62:10 thought philosophical thought mechanical
62:13 fide spiritual thought existential
62:16 thought we're in a sweet beautiful age
62:20 and I will tell every single one of you
62:22 can hear my voice if we are able to
62:25 affect change on the knee these douche
62:27 bags that have been controlling us
62:28 forever with their paranoid
62:31 schizophrenia about how they're going to
62:34 lose everything that they don't deserve
62:35 in the first place if we can affect
62:38 change then you can tell your
62:41 grandparent your grandkids and their
62:43 grandkids forever and they'll continue
62:45 to repeat the story that you and your
62:48 family male/female old young whatever
62:51 that you were part of the movement that
62:53 woke up the world let's be that
62:57 generation let's be that generation
63:01 let's dig deep
63:02 hopefully this episode got you to a
63:04 point where you'll no longer ever say
63:06 that gravity doesn't exist what you can
63:09 say as gravity is not what we're taught
63:10 in school at this particular 2017 moment
63:14 mass does not pull on mass unless it is
63:19 physically connected the amount of
63:22 physical force models that you have to
63:24 understand you completely understand the
63:26 universe once you adopt what the Masters
63:30 of electricity figured out a hundred and
63:33 fifty years ago all right it's a handful
63:37 of vectorial forces just understand how
63:40 a bullet ricochets off of a surface and
63:43 you will have virtually all of the
63:46 knowledge you need to completely
63:48 understand out everything exists it's
63:51 all just a bunch of classifications of
63:53 currents think about water think about
63:56 how it behaves think about how we have a
63:58 hundred ways that we say water is a
64:00 different thing that's all the universe
64:03 is people
64:05 just understand that thinking if you're
64:08 not used to it could be a painful
64:10 experience you get tired the more that
64:14 you have to think in a manner that you
64:16 are constantly being bombarded with
64:17 concepts that you don't quite understand
64:20 more you use your mind and think it
64:23 starts to become euphoric it starts to
64:25 become almost sexual the way that you
64:27 feel when you think and it becomes your
64:30 preferred pastime we need to get to that
64:35 state as well now when I put a tiny
64:37 digression into the end of this just
64:39 before I sign off because someone asked
64:40 me to talk about this I talked about in
64:43 a Bigfoot episode that there are
64:44 potentially interdimensional you know
64:46 beings and that's sort of a
64:48 tongue-in-cheek assertion on top of what
64:50 I believe to be a fairly ridiculous
64:51 theory these things exist but someone
64:55 said well what do you mean by another
64:57 dimension and you'll if you watch all my
65:00 episodes you'll understand that I do not
65:01 believe that they're actually
65:02 necessarily physical different places in
65:05 the universe I just feel like dimensions
65:08 are the way we measure what we're able
65:10 to see within a set of data so our
65:13 eyeballs can only bring a certain
65:15 frequency of awareness into our brain as
65:20 electrical signals therefore I can
65:21 recognize the fact I got a computer in
65:23 front of me a camera etc right if
65:26 something is in existence but it doesn't
65:30 one collide with my body like some
65:32 mysterious force you know or so I could
65:34 feel someone touching me all the time
65:35 but they I can't see them be disturbing
65:37 right there could be several different
65:40 frequencies of this ether or wind by
65:43 which we cannot recognize and we know
65:45 x-rays exist
65:46 infrared light exists and we don't
65:47 necessarily see those right we can see
65:50 their effects on other things radiation
65:52 we don't really see but goddamn we can
65:54 feel it right just think about the fact
65:57 that there could be life as that is
66:01 being brought into existence or
66:03 sustained by the same exact model that
66:06 we are sustained but for whatever reason
66:09 due to frequency not proximity really
66:14 but frequency and it probably is a
66:15 proximity thing in a physical model it's
66:17 able to
66:19 vibrate and exist it's current could be
66:22 exactly on top of another current but
66:24 they're unable to interact with each
66:26 other due to their methods of vibration
66:29 and so that's how you can have
66:31 interdimensional life that is exactly
66:34 where we are right now and you know it's
66:37 kind of a foolish assertion that they're
66:39 here exactly where we are if there's
66:40 other planets that you know we could
66:42 have four or five infinite you know
66:45 planes of existence where there's two
66:47 solar systems right on top of each other
66:48 but you can't see them and they can't
66:50 hit each other so that you don't notice
66:52 they're there so dimensions are just
66:55 man's proprietary way to say we're going
66:58 to classify everything that moves like
67:00 this in this dimension
67:02 and everything that moves like that is
67:04 in a different dimension every time I
67:06 hear someone say oh my gosh you're
67:08 scientists they got the dimensions up to
67:10 like 32 really
67:12 how about infinite how about since we
67:17 know that frequencies are infinitely
67:18 divisible and infinitely macro that
67:22 there's infinite dimensions we don't
67:25 really need to worry about it okay I
67:27 don't know why we would do research we
67:28 don't we don't understand our current
67:30 dimension that we can see with our own
67:31 physical eyes but perhaps someone has a
67:34 good reason anyway hopefully that helps
67:39 and hopefully hopefully you fill me in
67:41 this episode I'm tired of the argument
67:44 I'm tired of people just arbitrarily
67:47 saying that gravity doesn't exist with
67:49 absolutely no no follow up with saying
67:54 well you know I know there's two
67:56 theories of gravity there's the popular
67:58 book theory which is mass pulls against
68:00 mass which is classified in Wikipedia as
68:02 quote-unquote a phenomenon in the first
68:04 sentence and then there's this ether
68:06 model that was you know discovered by
68:08 the smartest men that have ever lived in
68:10 our last 200 years and they said there
68:14 was a thorough Winton's that created
68:15 gravity and I know both those theories
68:17 and I say it doesn't exist in here's why
68:19 that's what I've never heard so there's
68:22 no smoking gun with Flat Earth by saying
68:24 water always seeks a level that's
68:25 complete horseshit that's complete
68:29 horseshit
68:30 don't be one of those people
68:31 if you want to contest that then you
68:33 need to come up with a third theory that
68:36 takes into account everything upset on
68:37 this episode deep thoughts radio calm
68:40 for all the feeds I will say at this
68:43 exact moment I am figuring out the for
68:46 some reason iTunes is not updating
68:48 manually so I'm trying to figure out
68:50 exactly what that deal so I can update
68:51 it physically manually but d-plus radio
68:54 calm as the YouTube feed if you want to
68:57 see a video of this whole adventure or
68:59 it also links you off to the podcasts if
69:03 you want to get it there so again if
69:04 you're trying to listen to it on your
69:06 mobile device just access the website
69:08 from your mobile device if the little
69:09 looks like a speaker wave icon for RSS
69:12 feed you can use iTunes or Google Play
69:15 let's the other two places just remember
69:16 search on deep thoughts radio and you'll
69:18 find it anyway thanks for joining me
69:21 I'll see in the next episode take care
69:23 of yourself and someone else over and
69:25 out
