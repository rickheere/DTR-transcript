00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentlemen today's episode is wanted to
00:34 hurt me drop the other day and I thought
00:39 since we're in this climate that we're
00:41 in in the world it's actually extremely
00:43 valuable to to really start calling out
00:47 the esoteric
00:49 for those of you who work really hard in
00:52 your life in every category your you
00:55 work hard on yourself you put a lot of
00:58 effort into your relationships into your
01:00 family your kids your job your belief
01:04 system you do lots of research whatever
01:10 you will undoubtedly have felt this
01:14 entire episode but may not have been
01:17 able to put it into words
01:18 in a way that you can again weaponize
01:20 what you're doing to basically say this
01:23 is what I do leave me alone and by the
01:26 way if you don't do this you should ask
01:28 yourself why and don't try to control me
01:33 because I do what I do it's gonna be
01:38 what I call effort shaming look at the
01:43 climate of the world there's a bunch of
01:47 individuals that apparently can't think
01:49 for themselves they prefer not to think
01:52 for themselves because it's in their
01:55 mind it's sort of like Easy Street the
01:57 whole way if they pretend like they
02:00 don't know speak of the language that
02:02 you speak and someone has to translate
02:04 and help them put their pants on fill
02:07 out a form at the DMV whatever it is if
02:11 eating right and exercising makes you
02:13 look good and I don't mean hard abs and
02:17 arms forts New York rap just generally
02:19 healthy right we all fluctuate but you
02:22 don't I mean the difference between
02:24 being abusive to yourself versus sort of
02:27 staying within the average mean of
02:29 humanity
02:31 you're bad if you do that if you take
02:35 care of yourself and they're good
02:39 they want to just let it all go if you
02:42 choose your political affiliations which
02:45 are very strategic right we no longer
02:46 are party affiliates we are individual
02:49 affiliates and even that can fluctuate
02:50 day to day week to week at least you're
02:54 trying to figure out the background of
02:55 these individuals what makes them tick
02:56 do they have any history of being
02:59 nefarious or untruthful nebula' t'v you
03:06 do your research for anyone conspiracy
03:10 that you might listen to and may be
03:12 adopted to your regiment of belief you
03:14 do your research you've figured out
03:16 you'd used logic you perhaps tap into
03:19 some science here and there to validate
03:21 what's technically possible you go talk
03:23 to people that are way smarter than you
03:25 in those arenas to confirm your
03:27 suspicions you dedicate hours and hours
03:30 and hours you study history you study
03:34 revised history first which is what
03:36 we're all taught and then you go back
03:37 with the guts to piece it all together
03:44 to apply logic to history which some
03:48 people just might blow that up and say
03:49 well history's not logical well you know
03:51 there's a lot of wars that have been
03:55 started by some pretty frivolous claims
03:59 you look at yourself on a psychological
04:01 level if you have a family or a
04:05 relationship you're looking at sort of
04:07 the mini sociological level the micro
04:11 sociological interactions and what's
04:15 interesting about a family and
04:16 especially even just a relationship
04:17 before you build a family is the things
04:19 that you adopt into your relationship
04:21 can greatly affect your relationship
04:26 both in a good way in a bad way and the
04:29 fun of life is making the mistakes in
04:31 correcting and getting it right and know
04:34 that you've been down the street of
04:37 getting it all wrong you've been there
04:39 your human being it's okay and then
04:43 there's the the folks that go down that
04:47 road and whatever reason there was never
04:50 any vision of being anything
04:52 in life at all no goals no nothing
04:55 what's happening right now
04:57 is that if you put effort into something
05:01 if you gain a dimension if you become a
05:03 higher vibrational human being then the
05:08 classic haves and have-nots algorithm of
05:11 mob rules king of the jungle will start
05:19 to attack you because you're making them
05:22 feel bad one of the first stories I ever
05:26 heard of a buddy of mine who had worked
05:30 at the NS a long long time ago probably
05:33 in the 80s he said that he joined the
05:36 NSA and that he was so excited I don't
05:40 even know what they would do back in
05:41 those days but he said that he worked
05:43 really really hard and they took him
05:45 aside and said um what are you doing
05:49 what do you mean I'm doing my job trying
05:53 to do it the best I can he like this is
05:55 a government job I know you came from
05:57 outside but you need to slow down and
05:59 calm down because we have a tempo here
06:02 at work and you're fast-paced idealistic
06:05 approach to everything is making us look
06:06 bad because you're turning in way more
06:09 results than we do and we want to keep
06:12 it down here so that we don't end up
06:13 working you know our fingers to the bone
06:17 and you know honestly on one level
06:20 there's probably some sage advice we
06:22 work too much in this world so effort
06:25 shaming is in all kinds of categories of
06:30 life and I'll just give you a few
06:31 examples we're into a ton of examples
06:32 and explain this so that again you can
06:35 weaponize the defense mechanism in
06:37 yourself to say no it's okay if I choose
06:39 to have effort and if you're gonna try
06:42 to control me with your doctrine I need
06:44 to see that you've put in the same
06:45 amount of effort that I've put in so
06:48 that you can discuss the issue
06:51 you know campaign for a particular law
06:54 to be passed or to be revoked the change
06:58 the way my kids learn how to learn
07:02 subjects in school how many vaccinations
07:05 my kid needs to take
07:07 you know that if you're watching this
07:10 show and you're a habitual watcher we
07:13 are those who put in a tremendous amount
07:17 of our personal time that could be used
07:19 for other things you know I mean just
07:22 think about I've personally recorded and
07:24 I think that in your own way you have
07:26 equal if not more than the time I've
07:28 spent researching and talking about this
07:31 in your own way but I'm up to like five
07:34 hundred and thirty episodes every one
07:37 average is about an hour and a half
07:38 apiece so think about it
07:41 750 hours of broadcast time not the time
07:47 takes to record edit all this other
07:48 stuff and then the tens of thousands of
07:51 hours of taste to research this stuff
07:52 have conversations with you folks you
07:55 still don't get it all right but you
07:57 work on it and the show is the evolution
08:00 of the thought process I've got shows
08:01 that say things I don't even believe
08:02 anymore it's like a tattoo tattoo it's
08:06 your it's your life story but right now
08:11 we have we have the low-hanging fruit
08:14 things that you can ignore someone has a
08:16 belief system about how all humans on
08:19 earth should eat perhaps they're
08:21 vegetarian perhaps they're big
08:22 meat-eaters you're on one side of the
08:24 fence and the nice thing about those
08:26 belief systems is that you can do your
08:29 thing and they can do their thing and
08:31 you know very seldom do you ever you
08:34 know swing swords against each other
08:36 it's just your own doctrine but then
08:40 they like I said they start changing the
08:43 school systems they put you know
08:45 transsexual pole dancers and the
08:47 libraries of schools to teach kids
08:50 something transgender guys reading books
08:54 to kids in schools I have anything
08:57 against trans sex change sexual guys but
09:00 I don't think sexuality should ever be
09:02 something that is brought up in school
09:04 kids need to gets all at different
09:07 levels different paces different parents
09:08 different maturity levels different gene
09:10 pools some some schools are sorry some
09:13 families are very religious and they
09:15 don't talk about that kind of thing some
09:17 are very liberal and probably run you
09:20 adult material on TV while kids are
09:23 walking by my mom's like doing a selfie
09:25 of herself you know trying to catch a
09:27 wife or Anthony Weiner sending himself
09:29 to a fifteen-year-old now your frettin
09:32 affect the public we have this gigantic
09:36 surge of socialism virtually no human
09:41 being on earth sits at home and thinks
09:43 about social socialism as that option in
09:46 a vacuum right doesn't make any sense
09:49 I'm gonna get the whole world to
09:50 contribute everything into a pool of
09:52 resources and some body of people are
09:56 going to figure out how to distribute it
09:57 appropriately to all the different races
09:59 and all the different continents and
10:01 islands and whatever because that just
10:04 seems [ __ ] now it just seems like no
10:06 one has that capability yet in this
10:08 planet we don't get along enough we
10:10 don't agree enough nobody in Europe can
10:15 effectively handle all these different
10:18 regions Al Gore's ridiculous movie gets
10:23 taught in schools as fact when all of
10:25 his predictions have failed still make
10:28 taught as fact and your kid if you turn
10:30 them over to the state which I
10:32 understand everybody has to my kid was
10:34 not in normal schools thank God she got
10:38 through all her formative years before
10:41 their junk really started hitting her
10:42 SuperDuper hard but I'm not just
10:46 fighting for my kid I'm fighting for
10:47 everybody's kid and that's not to sound
10:49 righteous it's just humanity is humanity
10:52 all slices all different factions around
10:57 the planet some need education so they
11:00 get out the warring mindset some need
11:02 education so they can figure out how to
11:05 be empathetic towards other human beings
11:07 so I'm just need to crawl you know but
11:11 we need to figure out how to allow
11:12 people to be in jungles and not bother
11:14 them but if they procreate too much
11:16 they're gonna about into the other
11:18 worlds which is why waiting forever to
11:21 see what happens is probably dangerous
11:25 but socialism is something that of
11:27 course we all know we beat it up it's
11:30 the controlling
11:32 bankers who got our money valued by a
11:35 cell of a barrel of oil and pain when
11:38 total control so they start infiltrating
11:41 the political systems through agenda 21
11:43 they're working with non elected
11:45 officials to change everything and it's
11:47 funny about this / ironic not really
11:50 funny is that you know I started
11:53 preaching this thing before kovat and
11:58 for any of you that were out there
12:00 questioning whether or not I was crazy
12:03 believing people that have been telling
12:04 me things about agenda 21 you are seeing
12:07 agenda 21 like the curtain has been
12:12 pulled back by Toto and there it is
12:15 right unelected people as well as
12:19 elected people who are on their payroll
12:21 are shutting down their states forever
12:24 you know states that barely have any
12:26 population density we have to have a
12:30 position by which we can defend effort
12:34 what is the socialistic view of money
12:36 distribution alright well if you work
12:42 really really hard as a kid to get
12:46 educated you go to school you go to
12:49 advanced schools like colleges and you
12:51 get SuperDuper educated it wasn't easy
12:54 for you to get educated
12:56 it wasn't easy on two different levels
12:58 one perhaps your family scrimped and
13:01 saved and didn't go on vacation so that
13:03 you could go to college perhaps you took
13:06 out a bunch of student loans just so you
13:08 could go to college because your family
13:10 couldn't pay for like mine but you get
13:13 that degree and you're one of the few
13:17 kids that gets a degree and something
13:19 that you want to do for the rest of your
13:20 life at least the first giant phase of
13:23 your life okay
13:26 so you build a you go work for somebody
13:28 else you get mentored and and
13:30 apprenticed up in that position you test
13:33 your theories you realize you've got
13:35 some secret sauce
13:37 eventually you break out and find a
13:39 client and you start your own company
13:41 and you work really really hard you're
13:43 working 12 to 14 hour days
13:45 but you're working seven days a week you
13:48 no longer go on vacations like you used
13:50 to because you can't because there's no
13:53 time you got to keep the company going
13:55 the economy's never reliable always be
13:58 closing right the ABC rule you work
14:01 really really hard but that other family
14:06 didn't prioritize school perhaps he
14:10 didn't have the gene pool or the brain
14:11 cavity to even notice that that was
14:14 important maybe they could be working
14:17 but they don't work and so they go on
14:19 welfare of some sort living off food
14:22 stamps living off socialism they don't
14:26 make enough money to pay for any
14:28 insurance so they get it all free from
14:30 the state meanwhile you're slaving to
14:33 pay your premium and the end of the day
14:38 this effortless body of people think it
14:42 is fair to steal your money that you
14:47 earn by working really really hard and
14:50 that you know there's the funny mean
14:52 going around it says you know this
14:53 hasn't gone around for a while because
14:55 of all the [ __ ] that's going on now
14:56 but the whole thing was there's not
15:00 enough there's not enough of other
15:02 people's money to finance socialism
15:05 because if you adopt it then you become
15:08 lazy and there's just not enough money
15:11 what is it would it be the point of the
15:13 whole planet existing think about a
15:15 creator creating our species to see some
15:18 experiment happen to incubate the soul
15:20 to the next level and then all the
15:22 sudden let's just say we pulled it off
15:25 the whole planet we don't get Gene
15:27 Roddenberry's world we get Bernie
15:28 Sanders world everyone fails to get a
15:33 job like him until you're 40 and then
15:36 you just meander around your job talking
15:40 about and complaining about the fact
15:42 that you don't have enough of other
15:44 people's money their effort translated
15:47 into cash their brain power that's
15:51 advanced creating amazing things earning
15:55 a big income they see you with things
15:58 that they wish they had
15:59 so they try to shame you now the one
16:04 thing that's interesting it's sort of
16:06 the fringe of this theory here is that
16:12 let's say that you do a mass let's just
16:15 put a number on it you make a hundred
16:16 million dollars but the time you pass
16:18 away you get a hundred million large in
16:21 the bank
16:22 okay now you pass away you've done your
16:29 best to teach your kids some things but
16:33 they're different than you they have
16:34 different ambitions than you if they
16:35 were raised perhaps in Hollywood they
16:37 may not be Michael Douglas wanting to
16:39 follow his father Kurt Douglas or Jeff
16:41 Bridges wanting to follow his father
16:42 into it right
16:45 and so they depending on how you
16:48 distribute your cash they go off and buy
16:51 the nice house a nice car they're
16:52 inheriting the whole thing government
16:55 doesn't get to take take half of it
16:57 anymore and so they got the big Bentley
17:01 SUV they got the five million dollar
17:04 home ten million dollar home they are
17:06 just traveling around the world going on
17:08 vacation the entire time and so people
17:12 pointed those kids calling a trust fund
17:15 babies and they hate on them like crazy
17:17 they've got a ton of them in Orange
17:18 County California okay that means should
17:23 they not be allowed to spend their
17:24 parents money what you don't know is
17:28 that they live very marginalized lives
17:33 they don't have I mean you could you
17:36 could get a little box in the mail from
17:39 Amazon that's something that you wanted
17:42 in your house it's under 50 bucks and
17:45 you open it up and you could enjoy that
17:50 object under 50 bucks more than these
17:53 folks can enjoy a Bentley SUV because
17:57 you know what if they crash that Bentley
17:59 or get stolen they can just go buy
18:00 another one and any car that exists they
18:03 can just have it ten million dollar
18:05 Bugatti custom-made for them they can
18:07 have it
18:08 no effort like Ross Perot said saving up
18:12 for something you want to buy is
18:14 sometimes the most fun you'll ever have
18:18 gene Simmons says as well don't buy
18:21 anything you don't have cash for he
18:24 definitely was fortunate he had some
18:27 brilliant ideas and some really good
18:30 talent and three other guys he could
18:31 create a great franchise for but think
18:34 about that people that I've worked with
18:39 over the years three decades I've been
18:41 in business and I'm gonna repeat just a
18:44 couple little things here because it's
18:48 very valuable to understand I'll tell
18:50 you sort of a project I was involved in
18:53 once in my lifetime
18:55 my business partner was a very
18:57 successful guy in Hollywood he had made
19:01 millions in his lifetime but because of
19:04 the 2008 debacle he lost it all
19:06 never never pointed the the blame at the
19:11 right people for that was interesting
19:13 but we got into an investment well we
19:17 got in a situation where we needed an
19:18 investment in our company he and I put
19:21 quite a bit of money into it before we
19:23 met this guy but one of the reasons that
19:26 we consistently had a problem with the
19:28 investor is that my partner who had been
19:31 blessed to be paid a lot of money per
19:35 day for what he does he just kept
19:38 treating the investor like well you've
19:40 got money you should just cut us a check
19:42 you should just kind of sum million
19:44 dollars you should just do that and it
19:47 just kept aggravating and pissing off
19:49 the investor which inadvertently
19:50 affected me because when it came down
19:53 for him to demonstrate a lesson to my
19:58 partner I got the lesson too but he said
20:01 something really brilliant it took him
20:03 forever to get to this point if he had
20:05 said this on the first day it would have
20:06 really helped us out but maybe it took
20:08 him a while to find the words because he
20:11 was consistently frustrated this is a
20:13 man that worked his tail off had made
20:17 this is just his words he had made a
20:19 hundred million dollars in his lifetime
20:20 he probably had about 70 around 70 left
20:24 and he said you know let me just tell
20:28 you something about money he's totally
20:30 frustrated at this point something had
20:32 been said across the table like you
20:34 should just write us the checks and you
20:36 should stop paying us just barely of
20:39 money to exist I mean this guy was boy
20:41 it was a good businessman but he did
20:44 pinch us hard to the point he created
20:45 animosity between us where did he put a
20:48 grand in it it would have really kept
20:51 the heat off but anyway he randomly not
20:55 pay us to it was just weird but
21:01 he said I made most my money in the 80s
21:05 which was a couple decades before we had
21:08 this conversation and he said making
21:10 money is really hard it's very difficult
21:14 because if it was easy everybody would
21:16 be rich at least all the smart people
21:18 would be rich and he goes I know
21:20 brilliant people who have never been
21:22 able to earn another dime after their
21:24 lucky run with whatever they did to make
21:26 their money and you got to know that's
21:28 usually how it works it's very very rare
21:32 that people have these monster companies
21:35 like a Charles Schwab or Larry Ellison's
21:37 Oracle it's very very rare that you
21:40 create those machine machines which is
21:41 why those companies they're worth tens
21:43 of billions of dollars up to like a
21:46 trillion dollar market caps because
21:47 they've worked really really hard and a
21:49 bunch of other people you know obviously
21:50 work together to make these things
21:51 happen
21:53 but once he said that I brought that
21:55 lesson to you guys way back in the day
21:58 never repeated a couple times but it's
22:01 sort of at the core of this discussion
22:04 when I was in the video game business
22:07 something became apparent which was that
22:10 before I got in the video game business
22:12 as a kid I mean I started programming
22:15 games probably around 14 small ones at
22:18 my home and then by nineteen I had
22:21 created one no but that we sold
22:23 subversion master Tronics and it took us
22:27 months and months and months I don't
22:29 even remember how many months I think it
22:30 was about a year we worked on this thing
22:33 I'm just drawing 14 hour 16 hours a day
22:38 coder was coding everything but when I
22:42 got to Electronic Arts you know the the
22:45 average time to make a game was two
22:47 years Ultima Online oh my god I mean
22:50 probably took a decade to make that game
22:54 that's playing the beta in 94 and we
22:57 didn't release it to 98 which is four
22:59 years and they had been working on it
23:00 for several years before that just
23:02 waiting for the technology to catch up
23:04 with the concept there's great YouTube
23:06 videos on that game but you'll see
23:08 someone play a video game in the focus
23:11 groups or you'll see them out in the
23:12 wild you know
23:14 and they'll just you know play a game
23:16 and it's like you know some gigantic
23:20 game that cost 100 million dollars to
23:22 make took a team of like 50 people three
23:25 years to make it and kids will just
23:27 consume it in a couple of weeks and then
23:29 when everyone's what's next you know and
23:31 you see that nothing wrong done right
23:33 that's just the way it happens but what
23:35 it teaches you is how much it takes to
23:37 create great things that sometimes don't
23:40 turn our great by the way
23:41 but even when a masterpiece is created
23:44 people get tired they move on well what
23:49 happens when we really try to work hard
23:50 on something sometimes when you're on
23:54 the project of your dreams you cannot
23:56 work hard enough you hear these stories
23:58 a lot with Hollywood you know people get
24:01 on movies and they just they look around
24:03 on this this Star Wars thing is gonna be
24:06 pretty cool right yeah I think it's
24:08 really gonna be like landmark okay
24:10 nobody knows this exists it's never been
24:13 released before nobody knows it's gonna
24:15 be amazing but imagine trying to sit on
24:17 that franchise for three years looking
24:20 at the principal footage come together
24:21 in special effects and like this has
24:24 never been done before this is amazing
24:27 and they had to sit up and they're they
24:29 got you know scenes finished two years
24:31 in the kind of a year to work on it then
24:35 it's gonna debut these bands that make
24:38 these one-hit wonders right have no idea
24:41 it's gonna be a one-hit wonder until it
24:43 gets played at a club and all sudden
24:45 everybody moves to it and they look at
24:46 it and going this is a big thing so
24:48 let's get playing on the radio all the
24:49 time it's huge but now someone comes up
24:54 to you after you've had this one in a
24:56 million chance thing and they try to
24:59 take your money through all kinds of
25:02 different means you've seen this happen
25:04 to all kinds of people right was MC
25:05 Hammer made thirty million dollars in
25:07 about two years and he was broke two
25:10 years later unbelievable
25:12 people siphoned it off of him and if you
25:17 won't give it to them willingly and lose
25:18 it like he did to his friends and family
25:20 and a bunch of hangers-on they start
25:23 that next game on you well don't you
25:25 think you've made too much money
25:28 Barry Sanders argument what how much are
25:31 you worth Barry like I don't know you
25:33 filtered it what he siphoned off tens of
25:38 millions of dollars to his wife guy owns
25:40 three or four homes he looks like a big
25:42 outie $160,000 out he means that he's
25:45 rolling in it repaired to us that dude's
25:47 rich they keeps trying to convince
25:50 everyone that he's the guy that gets to
25:53 have it you're not to have it or
25:54 whatever bar like if he's worth fifty
25:57 million dollars then it's a hundred
25:58 million dollars where it's been for any
26:02 of you've ever taken at one point in
26:04 your life you've gotten your body to
26:05 look amazing and you really like you
26:08 didn't eat all the sugary food you
26:09 worked out all the time you went through
26:11 pain you wanted the food but you didn't
26:13 eat the food you want to stay in bed but
26:16 you got up went to the gym or you worked
26:17 out however you did and you make
26:19 yourself look amazing and then you're
26:20 going public and there's a lot of people
26:21 that are appreciate you who are single
26:24 then there's some people that are not in
26:27 shape and they kind of look the other
26:28 way or they do something to tear you
26:32 down I'm willing to bet there's quite a
26:34 few of you who watch this show because
26:37 you are extremely informed and because
26:39 you do redo your research and you test
26:41 it you don't just do research and say I
26:44 did my research and everything I think
26:45 is true you've tested it you've tested
26:47 it by yourself you tested with other
26:48 people and but someone will eventually
26:51 call you like a know-it-all and then you
26:55 look at your record gonna be like I
26:57 would never say that about myself but
26:59 you know what out of all the times that
27:02 we've argued about what should happen
27:04 had you done what I learned from
27:06 somebody else who you you accredit that
27:08 to me being a bully to you telling you
27:10 what to do in the end it was just me
27:12 learning from someone else I had already
27:13 made the mistake he would already made I
27:15 got this better advice I took the advice
27:17 I changed my life it became better at
27:19 past it to you you ignored it you failed
27:21 and then you wanted to chastise me for
27:24 trying to help you and later on of
27:28 course someone else tells them the same
27:29 exact thing and they immediately adopted
27:31 in Wow they win for the first time in
27:33 their life and you can't get any credit
27:34 for it getting it acknowledged just put
27:38 that way credit is whatever
27:41 that happens too right we have so much
27:45 HR going out around the world right now
27:46 and the interesting thing is is that the
27:49 most there's two types of hatred in the
27:51 world
27:52 there's experienced hatred meaning you
27:56 have experienced something the defacto
28:01 makes you hate something that's the only
28:05 bona fide hatred I think they could
28:08 possibly exist I would hate to say it
28:10 should exist because I don't want anyone
28:12 to feel that emotion in their life
28:14 you need to get that out of your brain
28:16 if you hate something like just kind of
28:19 figure out a way to not have to process
28:22 that on a daily basis especially but I
28:24 understand things happen the second tier
28:28 of that whole thing is that someone
28:30 tells you to hate something and I'm
28:34 assuming it's almost no one who listens
28:35 to this show but we know who they are
28:38 they're the effort shamers no research
28:42 don't know anything I hate say Donald
28:45 Trump he's got all these he's a racist
28:46 he does all these things and then when
28:48 interviewed to come up with the itemized
28:50 list of things why someone's wrong or
28:54 someone's right they just they have
28:56 nothing they just have a feeling they
29:00 got rewarded perhaps in public for being
29:03 with people just like themselves
29:04 effortless people and so they just hate
29:08 it's strange there's also at least in my
29:13 and my circle of friends and family that
29:17 I've had my entire lifetime I know
29:20 friends and family that have worked
29:22 extremely hard and they don't have well
29:26 I there's some that have worked really
29:27 really hard and lucked out there in the
29:29 right place right time got the money the
29:30 economy didn't crash they're able to
29:32 secure their funds and some sort of
29:34 investment those it's almost nobody I
29:36 know very lucky people very talented
29:41 worked very hard got it
29:43 yeah some people made legendary films
29:45 that I know and what they did was they
29:48 said I know this is probably a one-off
29:50 moment in my entire lifetime so instead
29:53 of buying a ridiculously expensive
29:55 palsun car and a bunch of shots keys
29:57 they put all the money in average things
30:00 and they still live that beautiful life
30:03 today because they're a little home they
30:04 bought for 36 grand is now worth 4
30:07 million because they bought it downtown
30:09 LA you know those kind of situations
30:11 then we have the well there's different
30:18 generations right so older generations
30:20 were able to follow all the rules if
30:22 their savings account and all their
30:24 investment vehicles before anything
30:26 really got cyclically insane
30:28 they took average jobs not the jobs that
30:31 they wanted to do their life goals
30:33 perhaps they I know some people that
30:34 have no big dreams and I have some
30:37 people that dreamed about mundane jobs
30:39 so that's cool for them you love what
30:42 you do man you have won the game but
30:47 because I'm an entrepreneur just can't
30:49 stop doing it I've got tons of friends
30:52 male and female young and old and we
30:56 have we get together and we talk and
30:58 dinners and cigars and whatever phone
31:02 calls and we talk about being rich and
31:07 then being broke being rich and being
31:09 broke and so we live we have the bruises
31:14 we have the scars we have the tears you
31:17 know but in the end you know what's
31:22 interesting about that last group is
31:25 that we can die at any point you know
31:29 it's like we did it we did it
31:31 we've had our successes or failures
31:33 everybody wants to end on a success but
31:36 in the end if you've done everything
31:37 once that you ever wanted to do - maybe
31:39 a couple extreme goals you're at peace
31:43 with your soul you really are you know
31:47 but how many of you cringe is the very
31:51 first time you heard that your kid could
31:53 get a trophy for losing something they
31:57 lose a sports game they get a winner's
32:01 trophy and the trophies are specifically
32:03 all the same size so that the winners
32:05 who worked extra hard to learn how to do
32:08 whatever they did they they're not
32:12 allowed to get a big statue but I mean a
32:14 big trophy I should say they're not
32:16 allowed to get that because it's gonna
32:17 be the other kids kids feel bad common
32:21 core common core is passing record of
32:25 amount of abject morons not their fault
32:28 not their fault they've been taught
32:31 poorly the reading of writing and
32:34 arithmetic that they're supposed to
32:36 learn was never taught to them in any
32:39 decent discipline because it was all
32:41 these transvestite reading courses it
32:46 was think about sex think about what
32:49 gender you are try to cross over if you
32:51 can well this other weird [ __ ] in school
32:54 it doesn't matter anymore I mean ever
32:56 you know it's like [ __ ] you should just
32:57 experience in life schools not they're
33:02 clinically a hundred years ago to teach
33:06 you how to pick your personal
33:10 preferences in school you are to take
33:15 the tools from school and go out and
33:18 find out what you want to do play around
33:20 have a summer off right kids get no time
33:24 off nowadays and that's where all the
33:27 imagination happens if I hadn't been let
33:30 go from school and Kansas was I'm not
33:33 May 25th I think was when you got out of
33:36 school even in Massachusetts when I went
33:38 to Massachusetts for two years it was
33:39 still into May you're out you get all
33:43 June all July and all August to yourself
33:45 as a kid and no babysitter's rear latch
33:49 key kids but there's no babysitter's
33:52 during the day there's always a couple
33:55 stay-at-home moms they usually keep
33:57 track of you because you had to eat that
33:59 was the cool thing so they always had
34:00 you by the short hairs when you uh if we
34:04 had any short hairs back then yeah it's
34:06 a combined visit and the moms are always
34:08 super engaging at that age because some
34:10 of them are just really cool why not
34:12 most my friends Mother's were just
34:14 wonderful people and just always full of
34:16 wisdom because when were strong and they
34:19 respected the fact that they were
34:20 allowed to stay home
34:22 they knew that being a mom was a job
34:23 well into itself I'm working is good too
34:26 and I think most of them went to work
34:29 just as the kids you know gotten to like
34:31 their own middle schools as junior high
34:34 but you're not allowed to make anyone
34:38 uncomfortable with your decisions for
34:41 your life I can understand if you're
34:44 trying to run around imposing your will
34:46 on other people but the very first time
34:49 I saw this as a child was the was at
34:54 Harper Harper Valley PTA was the movie
34:56 right PTA was parent-teacher Association
35:00 I think and it what it did and I don't
35:04 know how long this has been around in
35:06 the invasive way that it showed up in
35:08 the 70s but the way it showed up was
35:11 that schools usually just ran the school
35:13 the way they wanted to run it I don't
35:15 remember having any teacher
35:17 parent-teacher conferences when I was a
35:19 kid you know my parents didn't go to
35:21 school find out how you know amazing I
35:24 was there on crappy I was until a little
35:26 bit later but the parents started
35:28 getting in there and you got some people
35:30 that you know they it really came down
35:36 to like the the woman that was
35:37 subservient shouldn't have been but was
35:41 forever cultural reasons or you she had
35:43 a diamond a husband who knows they but
35:46 they would taste a little bit of
35:47 authority and they go absolutely berserk
35:51 trying to tell the school how to do
35:53 everything in the schools
35:56 the parents actually learned how to
35:58 complain to the upper district overseers
36:02 who really were just lazy people
36:04 I mean honestly my god I remember I
36:07 remember the names they were super rich
36:10 people my hometown lived in the nicer
36:12 neighborhood the nicest neighborhood
36:13 excuse me in the nicest most modern
36:15 homes and we're like how does that
36:17 person make their money oh there there
36:19 on the teachers cancel and you know
36:24 probably making six six figures and the
36:27 80s you know so they're just cleaning
36:29 house man home my hometown like a fancy
36:32 house super fancy house but it cost a
36:35 hundred thousand dollars you
36:36 rollin like Beverly Hills to my hometown
36:37 100 grand most homes were about 35 to 50
36:41 grand imagine that you could pay for
36:44 your house in two years unbelievable but
36:48 they would start threatening this group
36:50 above that would then start passing the
36:53 threats down to the schools and so the
36:55 school start modifying themselves to
36:57 accompany these parents and it was a
36:59 teeny-tiny fuse burning in the 70s and
37:02 then by the time you got to the end of
37:03 the 80s and especially in the 90s people
37:07 who knew nothing about education were
37:08 driving schools was a Charlotte is
37:12 Herbie wrote the book about the
37:14 deliberate dumbing down of America it's
37:17 very important to remember she said her
37:19 father was the skullenbones guy I showed
37:22 she's very forthright about that her
37:25 book is gigantic it's like a physically
37:28 large book and it's pretty damn thick
37:30 but she talked about some paper bag I
37:33 think she said around 1973 she worked in
37:36 New England and this European
37:41 conglomerate came over and brought a
37:44 whole new regiment of how American
37:47 children were gonna be educated and she
37:50 was calling what the hell is this and
37:53 what was really interesting about it and
37:55 I haven't pieced it together on the show
37:57 for you but if you read her book the
37:59 deliberate dumbing down of America just
38:02 go watch a video of her describing the
38:04 book and you won't have to buy the book
38:06 Charlotte is Irby she talked about the
38:12 redesigning of America and the
38:14 destruction of America and every single
38:17 thing she said is now a part of agenda
38:21 21 so approximately 18 years later in
38:24 nineteen well actually no 20 years later
38:26 in 1993 159 countries sign it and now
38:31 we're watching it we're watching it live
38:35 you know what we're watching right now
38:37 an analogy would be if you've ever seen
38:40 Star Trek and you see someone teleport
38:42 into the room right and you see all that
38:43 smoky apparition turning into a human
38:45 being and then finally the human beings
38:47 there
38:48 we're in the early phases of the
38:49 transporter beam coming in of agenda 21
38:53 except it's all around us it's on our
38:56 Capitol Hill right the Senate just voted
38:59 to allow the FBI to spy on your internet
39:02 traffic without a warrant
39:04 okay Fourth Amendment Fourth Amendment
39:07 if it was a person I've not only been
39:09 stabbed in the back they've been stabbed
39:11 in every conceivable spot that you could
39:14 fit another so the only reason why they
39:15 stopped stabbing it was they can't find
39:17 a place to stick a knife and deep enough
39:20 to actually touch flesh that's the
39:22 Fourth Amendment right now in the United
39:24 States of America she talked about how
39:27 they were going to destroy the Midwest
39:28 that little problem for them because the
39:32 Midwest hangs on to ways that work and
39:37 produce great kids smart kids good
39:43 people a good moral basis ain't no one's
39:46 perfect
39:47 and again you slip out of the Midwest
39:50 and remember there's areas of America
39:53 they kind of get lumped in with the
39:54 Midwest that aren't the Midwest the two
39:57 hillbillies that shot the black guy yes
40:00 he did rob the house the night before
40:01 they got him on video camera robbing a
40:03 house and he went back to that house the
40:05 second day and that's when they chased
40:07 him down wasn't punishable by death they
40:11 blew it blew it blew it stupid
40:15 so the point of this episode gets at the
40:20 genesis of your life so let's just say
40:24 you know when we're born in this life I
40:26 think reincarnated we are not allowed to
40:28 remember our previous life to avoid
40:31 going insane but I think there's might
40:34 be a reason why babies cry you know we
40:36 might be literally remembering our
40:39 previous life looking around going oh my
40:41 god how my child again Jesus I sure hope
40:45 there's a little break in between but if
40:47 we just come right back you know and it
40:50 just wears off on you you're okay I'm
40:52 figuring this out again hell for all we
40:55 know we're a different creature and so
40:57 we're looking at you know like that
40:59 Twilight Zone episode where everyone has
41:00 the weird
41:01 cases and the trying to do surgery on
41:03 the woman that the gorgeous woman and
41:04 they see her gorgeous again I'm like I'm
41:07 so sorry the surgery didn't work you're
41:09 not like us but anyway you're born
41:13 unless say you do keep a little bit of
41:14 your faculties for a few minutes
41:18 well you already lived let's say you
41:20 lived a good life 80 to 100 years fairly
41:24 successful well if you look around and
41:29 the world is like a agenda21 world a thx
41:33 1 3 8 world and you're looking around
41:34 going oh my [ __ ] god half the people
41:37 in this room were robots my parents look
41:39 terrified to be in this room because the
41:41 robot I don't know may look like it
41:43 might attack em or did just attack them
41:45 or might attack them on the way home or
41:47 whatever and so you're trying to assess
41:51 your potential journey in this vessel
41:54 and if you wake up into a world where
41:58 effort is only to benefit somebody else
42:03 not you
42:04 which is what agenda 21 is your slaves
42:08 seriously you are slaves in that plan
42:11 you will only do things that will serve
42:16 somebody else who doesn't have any of
42:19 the restrictions that you have if you
42:21 get a microchip they don't have one if
42:24 you have to take vaccinations they don't
42:26 have to take them your to work create
42:30 whatever they want and just let's remind
42:33 ourselves don't go too dark here but we
42:37 know that there's human trafficking in
42:39 this world right now it's a big problem
42:42 and what allowed that to occur well a
42:44 lawless upper class they can do whatever
42:49 they want we're seeing it right now we
42:52 have seen in the last three and a half
42:54 years in America don't know about any
42:57 other country maybe you could chime in
42:58 we're really interested if there's any
43:01 examples of this in your country I know
43:03 that there's some judges in England a
43:06 part of parliament and they were
43:10 pedophiles had over 500 cases then they
43:12 allowed the guy's sister
43:14 to preside over his case and then he
43:16 dismissed it we know preachers have done
43:20 this to kids all over the place and they
43:22 just get shuffled around all the you
43:24 know no one ever sees any money or
43:26 damages for what they've done the kids
43:28 are already destroyed half the time but
43:32 now we've gotten wind of some super
43:34 duper uber dark stuff in a world where
43:38 Americans can still have guns where
43:40 we've got giant armies we'd stop bad
43:44 guys supposedly these pedophiles are
43:48 everywhere in this world now you wake up
43:53 in a new kid's body and you look at the
43:56 world and it's it's not lawless for you
44:02 it's lawless for them and you with your
44:07 knowledge for the for however many days
44:09 you might be able to preserve your
44:11 previous knowledge just as an example
44:13 here you are praying that you are an
44:18 ugly kid because if you're a cute kid
44:24 then you're just meat for these people
44:28 and your end will probably be very soon
44:32 and your end will be very painful
44:35 because that's what they do because when
44:38 you have everything that's what these
44:42 people are they have everything
44:44 you mean jacob rothschild saw house he
44:49 couldn't buy an island he couldn't buy a
44:53 person he couldn't buy either by force
44:56 or by consent when you have everything
45:01 all the time well then you will
45:04 indefinitely this has been a trend fall
45:08 in love with the taboo that which you
45:11 are not supposed to consume literally in
45:14 some cases is what you will gravity to
45:18 and what if it's just a science
45:23 I was talking to a friend of mine he's
45:24 very very experienced in Hollywood he
45:30 worked in Hollywood for 25 years if not
45:32 longer started on the bottom ended up
45:35 pretty close to the top he's not done
45:38 yet but he's there and he said you know
45:41 I have seen people change a hundred
45:46 times in Hollywood
45:47 they come in really good people they
45:50 have dreams they've got it all lined up
45:52 they're dudes and they're don'ts they've
45:54 been warned about all the things that
45:55 could happen to them in Hollywood both
45:57 as a psychological thing of you know
45:59 ignoring their fans their family to
46:01 doing taboo things and he said it's
46:05 funny the some of them always make it to
46:08 that dark side and it comes back to the
46:15 extortion of how your effort will be
46:18 applied to your success these people
46:22 will come in some cases with nothing
46:24 more than an ambition like a bad
46:26 American Idol audition they're tone-deaf
46:28 but they they're really good people and
46:30 they really want to succeed they'll do
46:32 anything it takes to get educated on how
46:34 to sing in tune they'll lose weight if
46:38 they need to they'll do whatever it
46:39 takes but way before that opportunity
46:42 ever gets defined to them the
46:43 methodology to get what they want is
46:45 ever defined to them they get approached
46:51 and someone says I can get you where you
46:54 want to be as long as you do this for me
46:56 and it will normally be a formula where
47:02 they're going to offload a bunch of
47:04 effort on your back they're not gonna
47:06 have much effort they're going to get
47:08 out of you what they want and then as
47:10 soon as you lack the capability of
47:14 giving them the results that they want
47:16 either by will or by an exploration of
47:19 your popularity your talent base tops
47:22 out and there's no more they can assign
47:24 you because you can't get any further
47:25 you're gone done boom you're out you
47:29 ever wonder why they used to tell you
47:32 that females have about them
47:35 a 10-year lifespan in Hollywood if
47:37 they're famous but a male has a whole
47:40 lifespan right
47:41 look at De Niro and I'm not associating
47:46 these people with Janeiro's behavior but
47:48 like a Nic Cage he's pretty cool right
47:50 but he's he's been going forever all
47:53 these actors for Stan they're all these
47:56 folks can go forever when was the last
47:59 time you saw Heather Locklear in a at a
48:02 movie or meg Ryan in a movie you know we
48:05 even Reese Witherspoon's sort of in and
48:07 out here and there certain females who
48:10 age extremely like a Sigourney Weaver
48:12 she's just got she's always had a mature
48:14 presence so she got older she just grew
48:16 into her base talent that we expect from
48:19 her I don't know if Britney Spears
48:22 thinks she's gonna be performing you
48:23 know brand new tunes 20 years - no but I
48:26 can guarantee it most likely won't occur
48:27 unless she reinvents herself but we're
48:31 down here and we're not in that room
48:35 it's interesting to look at extremes in
48:37 Hollywood - then pull it back to our
48:40 world and our world it's all about guilt
48:48 tripping you for being informed how many
48:55 times I mean I mentioned a little bit of
48:56 this in my last and corona episode but
48:59 how many times have you been involved in
49:03 a conspiracy for years you know 9/11 is
49:05 a good one my level it's coming back
49:07 strong like I just had another I've had
49:09 a conversation every day about 9/11
49:11 probably last six days and I've only
49:15 brought it up once in those six days
49:17 other people brought it up to me and
49:19 they're just you know they're finally
49:21 just reprocessing the information and
49:23 they're like oh my god you know how'd
49:27 they ever believe it but then you go out
49:30 and you'll have some conversation and
49:33 it's not brought up by both people that
49:35 are asleep much anymore you know but
49:39 something will drop a different
49:40 conspiracy will drop that you've got a
49:42 lot of information on and you're ashamed
49:47 but you know in your mind the amount of
49:50 effort you put into that belief system
49:53 was not easy you were not happy to find
49:56 out name that information like I
49:59 definitely enjoy setting the record
50:01 straight about the moon but I am not the
50:04 slightest bit happy that the moon
50:06 missions didn't occur at all I wanted to
50:09 go to the moon I still do
50:12 who doesn't maybe if it's safe if we can
50:14 get there safely and come back home
50:16 safely be great why wouldn't you want to
50:19 step on Mars if you could do it safely
50:22 you can definitely come home it's like
50:24 Total Recall right what I want to
50:28 encourage you to do is to think this
50:29 through a little bit I think the first
50:33 stage is to figure out what is it in
50:35 your life that you have put a lot of
50:36 effort in which is routinely minimized
50:40 marginalized by those who don't put any
50:42 effort in anything the hot topics in
50:46 2020 would be a lot of things associated
50:51 with the thick ovid planned emigrate
50:56 vaccinations are something that people
50:57 have been researching now for a really
51:00 long time I'm a little upset that
51:01 someone didn't blow the whistle a little
51:03 harder when I was raising my kid but
51:07 again she didn't get the 76 shots the
51:10 kids are supposed to get today in this
51:12 scene so I mean just think about all a
51:16 little mercury droplets in your kid and
51:18 not supposed to have any in child
51:19 vaccinations but again flu shots have it
51:22 no matter what in anything that's like
51:25 kind of global like that could be put in
51:28 a kit and it's just insane right but the
51:31 theory is is that if they're vaccinated
51:33 they can't catch what you have so so
51:36 take your chicken pox vaccination and if
51:39 I got it you're good you should laugh it
51:41 off you should laugh at me and say man
51:43 you should have got the vaccination I
51:44 don't have it and I'll go hey it's just
51:47 a little thing you don't want as an
51:48 adult's my maternity shingles whatever
51:52 some of this I just recently mentioned
51:55 the whole masks fiasco the lies about
51:59 how a virus can live us
52:01 the human bunny for like hours and out
52:03 like 27 hours to some insane thing it's
52:07 so much crap the I'm sure I'm sure MIT
52:10 or Harvard Medical was able to create an
52:12 experiment where they were able to keep
52:14 an RNA strand functional for a really
52:18 long period but I'm telling you they're
52:19 a hazmat cleanroom I guarantee you it's
52:24 not some average convenience store test
52:29 by the way I need to correct a mistake I
52:32 made in a previous episode I think I've
52:34 said it several times now I was off by a
52:37 factor of 10 and it's because my buddy
52:41 told me all the wrong numbers you don't
52:44 the hospitals that diagnose you with
52:46 kovat don't get $1,300 they get $13,000
52:50 you don't get $3,900 if you die in the
52:54 hospital you get $40,000 so they're
52:58 making over 50 grand off of a patient if
53:02 they they lose you and they put that on
53:05 your desk certificate so just a little
53:06 correction their massive incentive right
53:10 and supposedly it's coming out of
53:12 Medicaid or something like then so you
53:15 need to assess what you're fairly
53:18 well-informed about and it's it's okay
53:20 to come up with a few of your passions
53:22 and kind of realized well you know I did
53:24 take too many people's word for our
53:25 maybe not too many but you say take a
53:27 lot of people's word for that maybe I
53:29 should go look that up again and
53:30 reconfirm just literally when you're
53:32 open you do get overwhelmed because you
53:35 hear a lot of stuff and you'll get into
53:38 his pattern or all guilty of it we're
53:39 like oh I doesn't surprise me that
53:41 doesn't surprise me the problem with
53:43 that is you might be letting in
53:44 something as a truth and you haven't
53:46 done any research plus there there are a
53:49 ton of things that I've been trying to
53:50 warn us all about which is the things
53:53 we've heard they're super outrageous hey
53:55 maybe totally true we may want to hold
53:58 off on some like frazzled drip video
54:01 thing until we hear some credible person
54:06 that we know who says perhaps they've
54:07 seen it they're scarred by it or
54:09 whatever and then we're gonna go okay I
54:10 don't need to see it I can see it in
54:12 your face
54:13 you sure it was ill early okay alright
54:16 hey dude I don't need to see it
54:17 I don't would be seeing something maybe
54:19 tell my child lay my head on my pillow
54:21 right for me personally I want to see
54:23 some non graphic stills from it so I can
54:28 see their faces and see the poor kid
54:30 that was supposedly in the video but
54:33 after you assess the things that you are
54:35 really certain about and things that
54:37 you're still debating you'll find that
54:41 it's actually fairly productive in
54:42 conversation to say okay well those two
54:45 things I'm not sure about I've heard
54:49 from some people I really trust that's
54:51 real I need to go and verify some of
54:54 that stuff because they censor the
54:56 internet now it's extremely difficult to
54:58 get some of the information that people
55:00 have seen though I've seen it in the
55:01 video has taken down and so it's never
55:03 gonna be shown again it is frustrating
55:05 the utter hell out of me that people are
55:10 saying you know constantly posting
55:14 videos or at least articles about videos
55:17 that are banned on YouTube now it's it's
55:20 okay in my opinion do to acknowledge
55:22 that of course we're being censored we
55:24 should talk about that but immediately
55:27 go to [ __ ] shoot calm and find the
55:29 video and pass that link around don't
55:31 give up wench people said oh my god I
55:33 want everyone to see play indemic just
55:36 on the front page of [ __ ] shoot
55:37 featured on the front page hey if it
55:39 slipped off the front page
55:40 sorry I'm playing Demming in the search
55:42 field boom there's like 15 copies of it
55:44 up there okay don't give up and you know
55:49 just don't just tell us about censorship
55:50 tell us about your show us what you got
55:52 so definitely make that a habit because
55:54 that's silly we won't bid shooting you
55:57 credit for what they're doing which is
55:59 protecting the First Amendment again
56:02 I've heard some people tell me oh but
56:03 shoot censoring and I I don't know that
56:05 that's anything other than real mega
56:08 hate speech right so you can't have in
56:10 my opinion an easily digestible like
56:14 super racist video up there calling for
56:17 people's death because of their race and
56:19 let that go I mean you know I don't know
56:22 maybe there's a way of preface in the
56:24 video with some generic you know
56:26 thumbnail
56:27 okay if you click this you're about to
56:30 watch some seriously racist stuff so you
56:32 should know this before you click this
56:34 you know so free speech but you read
56:37 forewarn no one should be loading a web
56:40 page and seeing a snuff film someone
56:43 being killed without you knowing what
56:44 you're getting into it's just not fair
56:46 to your brain some people can't handle
56:48 that and no matter I'll tell you one
56:52 that shocked me that the day it was a
56:54 compilation video of like people having
56:57 a bad day and there are routinely
57:00 fatalities in these compilations and I
57:03 watch Amelie to figure out like how easy
57:05 is it to get caught up in a traffic
57:07 accident walking across the street wrong
57:10 because it does improve your your
57:13 defensive autonomic system but it was a
57:16 I don't think this will be that dramatic
57:20 for me to tell you seeing it was was a
57:24 surprise man
57:25 it was South America kids kids and
57:30 adults were all swimming in this river
57:32 there was a little dock there and there
57:38 was a guy at the end of the dock I don't
57:40 know how old the guy was I don't think
57:42 it was it wasn't a child or anything
57:44 could have been an elite team too maybe
57:47 thirty year old guy but you never know
57:48 it's kind of far away and he got chomped
57:54 by an alligator or crocodile or
57:56 something and it was so violent and so
57:59 fast there was no there's no blood but
58:05 just seeing this human being he was
58:07 looking at the family members and
58:09 whatever friends and he's probably just
58:11 having a great time and all sudden boom
58:13 he's having what most likely what was a
58:16 fatal experience with this creature I
58:19 mean it was shocking so sometimes you
58:23 don't need to see things you know I'm in
58:27 an episode a long time ago first season
58:30 I want to say it's like 15 or something
58:33 like that which I remember when I
58:35 reiterated season 1 I was dating someone
58:38 at the time and
58:39 I sort of created it because of the
58:42 results of dating this new person and
58:44 she I don't think she was criticizing me
58:48 really but she was kind of I think she
58:53 was trying to get me to relax a little
58:55 bit
58:55 and I probably was a slightly different
58:58 person
58:58 five years ago and she just says you're
59:01 so intense all the time which is sort of
59:04 strange to me because I'm like well yeah
59:08 certain subjects come out on the table
59:09 we're talking about them I'll get
59:10 intense about that but then two seconds
59:12 later I'm making a an inappropriate joke
59:15 I'm we're all laughing right so I mean
59:16 it's like I'm sort of like you know it's
59:19 um it's like listening to classical
59:22 music or opera or something right well
59:25 the music goes slow it's in those unpack
59:27 I have a BAM and that was then slow
59:28 again it's like it's nice it's variety
59:30 you know it's like I am his neighbors
59:32 and all the time I have no emotions you
59:34 know it's like screw that but I made
59:36 this episode called being intense and at
59:39 the time she was watching the shows and
59:42 so I got back over her place and she's
59:44 like I watch that episode today about
59:47 being intense I said oh yeah I'm like
59:49 smiling at her she goes that was for me
59:53 wasn't it well not really but now you
59:57 understand hopefully you watched it's an
59:59 hour-long episode of me telling you why
60:03 it's okay to be intense and intense also
60:06 transfers to effort right it's not to be
60:10 intense to shock everybody in the room
60:12 that's a horrible regiment no one should
60:14 try to do but it was that sometimes you
60:21 can't achieve greatness without
60:25 incredible amounts of effort I just
60:30 watch I just finished today I started
60:32 watching it yesterday an hour 25 minutes
60:36 something like that special on Stanley
60:38 Kubrick a man that I
60:45 I don't know he's like he's a great that
60:48 I absolutely never got a chance to meet
60:50 whatsoever but I am a like many people I
60:55 am a huge like it's hard to say if I
61:00 just said I'm a huge fan of his
61:02 that does not remotely describe the
61:04 emotion that I feel when I look at his
61:05 work he was and will remain probably for
61:11 my lifetime
61:13 the most intense filmmaker in history so
61:18 far and there's been some amazing
61:21 directors out there but he was like Babe
61:26 Ruth not with the critics initially he
61:30 made films that people simply couldn't
61:32 understand initially 2001 a Space
61:34 Odyssey was fairly panned when it came
61:36 out and now it is an epic accomplishment
61:39 in science fiction filmmaking
61:41 you know Clockwork Orange was banned in
61:44 England a little Larry Barry Lyndon was
61:48 utterly pan mainly for its length it's
61:54 playtime was over three hours I don't
61:57 know that I've ever seen the movie all
61:58 the way through I'm gonna be watching it
62:01 this month anyway the guy meticulously
62:06 thought-out
62:07 every single scene he ever filmed before
62:10 he ever got to set and then he said once
62:14 he no matter how much he ever thought a
62:16 scene through the second that the cast
62:18 member the person that he actually found
62:20 to take the part which he spent a
62:22 tremendous amount of time trying to find
62:24 the right actors he said everything
62:28 changed the second that light hits an
62:30 actor he wouldn't even light a room
62:32 without the real actors and the real
62:34 costumes he just said you can do a
62:36 stand-in all you want to light the room
62:38 but it never works and so soon as the
62:40 actor comes in their skin tone is
62:42 different the air is different the
62:43 costume wears differently on their body
62:45 and so the actors especially with Barry
62:50 Lyndon they talked about
62:52 two days of lighting a scene so you have
62:56 you know Class A actors sitting in a
62:59 room for two days no acting it just
63:04 sitting there just sitting there for
63:07 hours and hours and hours just a lot of
63:11 scene and that is perfect he didn't
63:15 believe in getting what's called
63:16 coverage which is a lot of different
63:17 angles of the same shot you know move
63:22 the camera around you have all these
63:23 different choices when you're editing he
63:25 just said I know what angles I want the
63:27 scene to happen so he would take that
63:30 time of resetting up the camera every
63:32 single time and he would just shoot up
63:37 to a hundred and fifty takes just to get
63:39 one take utterly perfect and what was
63:42 interesting about it was that they said
63:46 that once he got the right shot you
63:49 could see it on his face he just
63:52 realized oh my god I got it and he would
63:54 smile then he would always acknowledge
63:57 it to the actors and to the crew the guy
64:01 effort effort effort it creates
64:06 perfection it creates greatness and it
64:11 is really really sad when we poopoo in
64:15 any avenue of the world there's always
64:20 this question about why we're here why
64:23 did God put us here
64:25 if you believe in a gun you have
64:28 believed in something man it was created
64:31 somehow I mean even if it's been here
64:33 the whole time
64:35 and even if you don't believe in
64:38 anything the the self-assigned goal of
64:46 mankind I think should be very similar
64:48 to the that of a divine creation theory
64:51 which is that I believe we are here to
64:53 improve ourselves as much as you
64:56 possibly can just imagine you know I
65:00 talked about in my my alternate
65:04 realities or parallel realities
65:06 gives me episode I get the distinct
65:09 feeling that this this reality that I
65:10 see these four or five different ones I
65:13 see all the time that those worlds are
65:17 really beautiful one person commented
65:20 that they actually see a darker place
65:23 and maybe that's an echo of the past who
65:26 knows the idea is if if let's just do
65:30 this as much as I might believe that I
65:34 have certain things under ramps I'm a
65:36 wise soul or whatever an old soul
65:39 I'm still riddled with a maturities for
65:42 sure for sure and so I see these other
65:47 worlds and they instantly have this
65:49 peaceful feeling or everyone in that
65:52 world is on the same page for their
65:56 individuality I never see a fascist
65:59 world in fact I rarely ever see people
66:01 other than the cars sometimes integrate
66:05 but when I get the distinct echoing
66:07 feeling of is that I'm not qualified yet
66:11 to be in that world because I'm not
66:15 mature enough to be in that world but
66:17 it's almost like a bait you know if you
66:20 get your crap together you can take your
66:22 pick of these five places you can go but
66:25 you can have to be on your best behavior
66:27 well it's very interesting about that
66:29 and I might be completely full of it but
66:32 we know that you know it depends on how
66:35 old you are and where your where your
66:36 life has been when you get around good
66:40 people most of us if we're not
66:44 Psychopaths we adapt to the better world
66:50 because it's just natural usually bad
66:53 behavior is a protest it's to get
66:57 attention and if you had attention then
67:01 there was no need to protest and people
67:03 are excited and genuinely loving you
67:07 interested anything that you're
67:08 interested in and if you change your
67:10 mind they don't there's no repercussions
67:12 they're interested in your change well
67:14 that's cool really you're gonna change
67:17 from the piano to the guitar that's
67:18 awesome
67:19 well let me know when you have somethin
67:22 to hear you know something to play off
67:24 I'll come to listen to you and I know
67:26 you won't be perfect so don't worry
67:27 about it
67:27 you know instead of being fearful of
67:29 practicing the piano and writing a song
67:31 in front of other people if they're if
67:33 you realized everybody in the room was
67:35 for you you would have this amazing
67:37 freedom to express yourself to put
67:41 effort in you know and if you succeed
67:45 there's no one shaming you out of it
67:47 how dare you play the piano better than
67:49 me I wanted to play piano tonight I
67:52 didn't have the patience to put into it
67:54 so he'd hate hate hate hate ad
67:56 you know the whole shame game should be
68:02 synonymous with another word shame in
68:07 well in traditional sense shame is
68:10 obviously a legitimate thing you have
68:12 done something wrong and in order to
68:17 remind you for a little while that you
68:20 did something wrong so that you won't do
68:22 it again
68:23 shaming typically happens like that you
68:28 were being to your sister and you
68:30 cheated on your wife you skipped an
68:34 episode of deep thoughts no serious
68:37 stuff but today shame is really all
68:41 about bullying I'm going to thought
68:45 police you into my behavior system being
68:50 a person the shaming person in this new
68:54 bully sense of the thought police thing
68:56 is that I want you down on my level you
69:00 know and because we can't unlearn things
69:04 without a lobotomy you physically and
69:08 mentally cannot make yourself as
69:14 unprogrammed and is blissfully ignorant
69:17 as these other people and so the
69:23 interesting thing is is that you know I
69:28 mentioned this to you a few times but I
69:30 have a joke with a friend of mine we
69:31 call it the God facts
69:33 God facts initially was a joke because I
69:37 thought about making a movie called God
69:38 facts which is that some type of Jim
69:41 Carrey character before he went nuts
69:42 maybe a Richter vase could do it but the
69:46 dude wishes for God facts and what that
69:50 does is anything he wants a metric on he
69:53 simply tells the world who here who just
69:57 put above the head you know it just
69:59 happens or he doesn't actually say I do
70:00 but he says who's killed someone in this
70:02 room and got away with a murder maybe a
70:05 movie theater a baseball stadium so
70:07 there's a ton of people downtown New
70:09 York whatever and then all of a sudden
70:11 he starts seeing like an old lady you
70:13 know a 13 year old kid I mean just like
70:16 you know just non predictive things and
70:18 he's seeing you know the gun facts of of
70:20 this person I'm gonna figure out a plot
70:22 for it but that's the mechanism the
70:24 premise of it but what was interesting
70:28 the god fact that we didn't have until
70:30 Kovac came around so there's any silver
70:32 lining at all maybe this who was an
70:36 effortless human being doesn't put any
70:40 work into anything if they do they just
70:43 pick a little niche they stick with it
70:45 and they stay ignorant to the entire
70:46 world and then they allow themselves to
70:48 be they primitively strike being blamed
70:52 themselves slashed shamed themselves for
70:55 having their own thoughts they
70:57 preemptively just bend over stick their
71:00 head in the sand and let all the bad
71:02 things happen in the world and then of
71:04 course eventually they will be on a
71:08 train somewhere getting tattoos on their
71:10 arms complaining right and I'm making no
71:14 fun of the situation I happen in the
71:16 past but these folks will be will find
71:19 themselves in a similar situation
71:20 getting vaccinations with chips and
71:23 florists and tattoos and they're gonna
71:27 go crazy they're gonna get depressed
71:29 they're gonna go mentally ill before
71:31 their time I have a really bad time on
71:33 the way on and imagine you're okay you
71:37 know again when I think about the whole
71:42 health regiment thing that's going on I
71:43 keep having this vision lately and I
71:45 mention it
71:46 times two friends and I've said this a
71:48 long time ago to you folks but at one
71:51 point in 1989 to 1990 I visited this
71:54 hospice kind of assisted living place
71:56 right and it had people that were dying
71:59 in there and I had people that were
72:00 fully functional but I was assigned to a
72:03 woman that was in I think 92 93 years
72:05 old she was perfectly fine she got up
72:10 and dressed herself every day she was a
72:13 decent shape very alert and it was
72:15 almost like um she didn't need me as
72:18 much she didn't believe I was her son
72:20 you know she was in suffering for
72:22 dementia Alzheimer's or anything I don't
72:25 know when she died but then obviously I
72:27 was 30 years ago since she's passed now
72:29 the woman there was three beds in this
72:31 in this room the one in the middle I
72:34 believe was 86 and she was wheelchair
72:36 ridden very mentally apt didn't think I
72:40 was her son but she couldn't walk
72:43 whatever happened to her took her legs
72:45 from her and then there was the third
72:48 bed and it was a 74 year old woman
72:52 beautiful woman and they took really
72:56 good care of these women I have to say
72:58 of the horror stories I've heard this
73:00 was one of the best places was in
73:02 Camarillo California but she was a
73:05 vegetable they said she was suffering
73:08 from Alzheimer's she never spoke they
73:12 did her hair her makeup every day he had
73:15 blush perfectly applied really super red
73:19 lipstick and a beautiful dress on she
73:21 was full-bodied I mean she wasn't skinny
73:23 or anything she wasn't fat or anything
73:25 she was just like a woman and I used to
73:28 sit and talk to her very briefly it's
73:33 kind of strange I didn't know what to do
73:35 I mean I today I would talk to her I
73:36 probably read her books today but she
73:38 sat there with her eyes open on the bed
73:40 in a full dress all by herself and it
73:47 was heartbreaking and they had a piano
73:50 on the breakroom
73:51 might after I revisited with the ladies
73:54 went on to the break room and I got on
73:56 the piano and I was writing tons of
73:57 music at the time so I would just play
73:59 for
74:00 at least an hour just read just
74:02 practicing my own tunes and you know I
74:05 think I wrote some pretty beautiful
74:06 stuff but anyway then I would find the
74:09 women in that break room we thought I
74:10 was their kid and when they would look
74:14 at me these gigantic eyes and they'd be
74:16 like oh my gosh you came to visit me and
74:19 just improv I just sit down and put my
74:21 arm around these women and give them
74:23 hugs and say yep how the heck are you
74:26 and I find out who I am you know in find
74:29 out I was their son I was somebody else
74:33 seeing the health regiment
74:35 literally in a room the oldest woman had
74:39 the best health because she didn't buy
74:40 into all of the artificial stuff I don't
74:44 know their regiment but again the
74:48 younger they got the more mentally
74:50 disturbed they were
74:53 and it's like we have to decide whether
74:58 or not we're gonna build us a world out
75:00 of a society of we have to decide what
75:04 kind of planet we want to live in you
75:07 know the do-nothing self-proclaimed
75:08 righteous people to contribute very
75:11 little to society besides hate which is
75:15 a destructive cancerous force or we go
75:19 get the prosperity that we've already
75:21 had on this planet they're trying to
75:24 take it all away folks again right now
75:28 it's it's really sort of uh I don't even
75:33 know how to put it I would like to say
75:35 like an intellectual war for freedom at
75:37 this point and you know it we could
75:41 argue down here on the on a citizen
75:44 level but if we don't take care of who
75:46 we elect and one night Australia got rid
75:50 of their Fourth Amendment they told all
75:53 their police officers that I can now go
75:54 inside homes and just raid them happen
75:57 like three or four days ago they did it
75:58 in the middle of the night just removed
76:00 a giant portion of their rights that's
76:04 all it takes man that's all it takes
76:06 I mean what if this is like logical
76:11 craziness here and this has been
76:13 suggested by other people and I can't
76:15 remember I feel like a comedian said and
76:17 maybe George Carlin said it but somebody
76:18 said something like this before but it
76:20 was kind of a funny logical joke which
76:25 was very simple what if the politicians
76:27 that brand had to lock in their their
76:31 opinions with the people their
76:34 constituents the people that voted them
76:36 into office they had to say if they said
76:38 they were kind of over new taxes than
76:41 they are prohibited legally for voting
76:43 for new taxes and if they want to change
76:46 their platform they can change it on
76:48 their next election they can reapply
76:50 with the people and say I have decided
76:53 that there are some good uses for new
76:55 taxes we're running out of money because
76:57 of some other things that we're doing
76:58 either we have to get rid of those other
77:00 things over you got to raise our taxes
77:01 just by a little bit and it's gonna
77:03 raise X amount of dollars because if we
77:05 have X the number of citizens and you
77:07 know if you approve of this I've got the
77:09 right to go and raise taxes up to this
77:11 level still could be a big propaganda
77:13 game what if swearing the constitution
77:18 of your country is something that all of
77:22 them have to sign up for you can't
77:23 violate the constitution of whatever
77:25 country you're in those are just an
77:28 alien bore rights you know I'll have to
77:29 touch them you can't touch them a much
77:34 higher court voted in by perhaps I would
77:37 say a unanimous vote to change the
77:39 constitution of your country it's kind
77:43 of absurd but we don't do that do we we
77:47 elect people that say one thing and then
77:49 destroy their cities San Francisco's
77:51 destroyed Hawaii I don't even know how
77:55 Hawaii is gonna survive this go good
77:56 thing they have not banned tourism but
78:00 they said you have to quarantine before
78:02 you go into that state but they're part
78:03 of the Union and they're creating
78:05 outrageous requirements well they I
78:08 think their numbers are something like
78:10 60% of their income is on tourism well
78:13 if you own a luau company over there
78:18 you're done you got no money so how do
78:22 you pay your Rinnegan how do you pay
78:24 your bills let me keep the power on how
78:26 to keep your internet on how to keep
78:27 yourself on how do you feed your
78:28 children when you're not allowed to make
78:31 money oh here's your twelve hundred
78:32 dollar check enjoyed that in Hawaii you
78:35 probably eat you know for a week it's
78:40 amazing these states key voting blue
78:42 it's like governor I think was a
78:44 two-year term so why just changed once
78:48 just do two years a what could they
78:50 possibly destroy in two years at the
78:51 Blue has a disturb for you completely in
78:53 all the years that you keep voting blue
78:56 but to get back to my initial point is
78:59 that the one thing that kovat has done
79:01 is given us a God fact we now know which
79:06 one of our friends and family members
79:07 are bullies thought police bullies we
79:12 now know which mayors senator
79:15 House representatives and governors are
79:18 agenda21 shells we know we know exactly
79:22 who they are now they have defied all
79:25 logic again kovat supposedly okay with
79:32 all this $50,000 per patient incentive
79:35 to lie on a piece of paper has only
79:37 produced 88,000 people in the United
79:41 States passed away it changes all the
79:42 time so you know I've got a little app
79:44 on my computer that keeps it in my view
79:47 so I don't quote it too badly often I
79:49 make an episode but you're supposed to
79:52 starve to death you're supposed to have
79:55 all of your rent deferred which means
79:58 you have 100% accountability to pay it
80:01 but you can't your politicians are
80:04 saying you can't work I'm in California
80:06 and even though my Huntington Beach
80:09 California is the national news every
80:10 single day it doesn't matter the
80:13 businesses are still freaked out to open
80:16 so they can't make any money so they're
80:18 not gonna pay for my services from all
80:21 businesses all walks of life
80:23 everything from Hollywood Hollywood shut
80:25 down
80:27 I got scripts sitting on you know agency
80:31 desks waiting to be evaluated but no
80:34 one's coming in to work but it's nice
80:37 now that we've had a bunch of people
80:39 show their true colors now we have to
80:43 campaign very diligently and very
80:47 carefully to some people reiterating
80:50 that behavior to say look this made no
80:53 sense from the very very beginning
80:55 influenza kills more people than Co good
80:57 any day of the week but we didn't panic
81:02 and shut down the world like h1n1 killed
81:06 something like 45,000 people in America
81:11 didn't shut down the whole country
81:14 didn't shut down the world kitty yes we
81:19 and she is check her out right in the
81:21 camera good
81:23 is anybody cat and she's the sweetest
81:25 thing you know I've been saying it for
81:28 probably three
81:29 years this thing that I hope you repeat
81:32 if you believe it which is you know in
81:38 my experience personally my more liberal
81:41 friends have a regiment and the regimen
81:44 is research nothing therefore know
81:47 everything and so what I say in
81:51 conversations when I hear propaganda
81:54 right off TV out of someone's mouth as I
81:57 look at them and I just go well you know
82:00 there you go I said that's the research
82:01 nothing know everything theory and look
82:04 at me really funny because I'm calling
82:06 them out but I'm not really you know
82:07 calling them names or anything
82:08 using friendly words to remind them I
82:11 can tell you how to research anything I
82:15 did the episode the other day on NASA
82:17 right and God bless the listener who
82:20 commented but he said you know I could
82:23 just it's that old thing you know it's
82:25 that I always say to you guys it's the
82:28 he took that attitude in the comment
82:31 he's like oh you just so don't
82:33 understand how Rockets work in space and
82:36 you mentioned ether instantaneously I
82:40 know that person has researched nothing
82:42 hasn't thought it through its barnes and
82:45 noble facts all the way men all right
82:48 well I guarantee you I could take that
82:50 person aside quarantine them into some
82:52 academic Mensa test and they're gonna
82:55 come up zeros men debate they may do
82:58 pretty good on Jeopardy we're memorizing
83:00 a repeating crap but a second I give my
83:02 IQ tests where they have to discern we
83:04 think they'll fail miserably and what do
83:10 you want in this world what do you want
83:12 is the fabric of the universe that we
83:14 know which is planet Earth we want
83:18 people engaging effort now I will
83:20 definitely tell you and repeat something
83:22 that all those senators who listen to
83:23 the show know quite well which is that
83:26 we do overwork ourselves in the modern
83:28 world we have been duped to by
83:30 corporations to feel guilty if we don't
83:33 take our work home you know our kids
83:35 come home with piles of homework it's a
83:37 strategy to keep your kids away from you
83:40 so I think I said it a long time ago
83:43 if you want to protect your family unit
83:46 and you can't afford private school then
83:49 what you should probably do and it's
83:51 going to take more effort on your part
83:52 but it'll yield more family time is that
83:56 stay up to date with your kids
83:58 classes and I know something that's hard
84:00 because maybe you know they're learning
84:02 some mathematics you never learned or
84:04 whatever but whatever you can do call a
84:06 family member that's good at it and
84:08 neighbor who's good at it and get all
84:10 the homework together and all the adults
84:13 do all the homework make the kids watch
84:16 make the kids try to explain to your
84:18 kids but if they don't get it
84:19 don't worry do all their homework for
84:21 them that I'm handed in
84:23 so come tell anybody kids are gonna be
84:26 like yeah cool man and now let's go
84:28 watch TV let's go have dinner together
84:30 let's sit and talk to each other
84:32 let's do do karaoke in the living room
84:34 together whatever you want to do take a
84:36 walk go to Disneyland for the night
84:39 whatever you can do have family time
84:42 don't let these schools rob you from
84:43 your kids and some of you know you'll be
84:47 incredibly shocked at the stuff your
84:51 kids are being taught at the same time
84:52 rates is probably good you stay engaged
84:54 I would love to have a kid today because
84:59 I would keep the kid clean I just met a
85:01 father who was visiting the house party
85:04 were having across the street and he's
85:09 he's 41 years old and he said I have
85:11 three kids and none of them about
85:12 vaccinations and I was like wow I mean I
85:17 just said where's your cape man you're a
85:18 superhero dude he's like I can't afford
85:21 to keep them and you know private
85:24 schools so I just sit on them make sure
85:26 they get what they get but imagine
85:28 raising a kid now with an open mind you
85:30 know all the paradigms of indoctrination
85:33 you got your kid for you know probably
85:36 the first five years at least at home
85:37 and so you work on them make sure they
85:40 understand some some basic concepts of
85:43 the world some but simply the mechanisms
85:46 of how things are taught to them I think
85:49 go to school and you know they're pretty
85:51 clean for the first couple couple weeks
85:54 but you want to ask him what happened in
85:56 the day because if they start
85:57 in transvestites to teach your kids
85:59 stuff you need you need a little whistle
86:03 there and get you kid out at school or
86:04 get somebody in trouble yeah it's
86:06 different I want to say it's different I
86:09 haven't seen this but there are people
86:13 that do change their genders and they're
86:14 totally normal people for you know all
86:19 intents and purposes and so they they're
86:21 not the exhibition kind the rupaul kind
86:24 that are coming in just being a
86:26 spectacle it's nuts and this shit's
86:29 happening in like conservative states
86:31 supposedly just blows my mind to pieces
86:34 and what's funny is I you know I have a
86:36 few friends that are gay and I talked
86:39 about that is this am I like being an
86:41 old man here thinking this is nuts and
86:43 they're like no that's insane like okay
86:46 all right it's our opinion whether it's
86:49 right or wrong deli God knows but again
86:55 if you don't want that in your kid's
86:57 life someone's gonna come around and
86:59 shame you for it oh you hate all the
87:02 transvestites like no no people that
87:04 watch an ex-girlfriend of mine at one
87:06 the RuPaul show okay do I hate her
87:11 no no hey being on the show hell no
87:13 there's an adult having an adult show
87:16 when it bears an adult time slots and
87:18 there you go it's you know it's a free
87:21 world but I think what's interesting is
87:24 is that um you know things get confused
87:27 about freedom of speech and I guess it's
87:31 probably just freedom of speech and
87:34 maybe some of the umbrellas of religion
87:37 but you can have some pretty evil stuff
87:40 in freedom of speech you get some pretty
87:41 evil stuff and the freedom of expression
87:43 and that sort of thing in religion
87:45 there's st. Mystic churches that believe
87:47 in human sacrifice okay so when the
87:51 doctrine violates the Ten Commandments
87:53 and the Constitution United States
87:55 giving you two spectrums of thought
87:56 there yeah you know these can't exist no
88:00 wonder all those milk cartons get full
88:02 of kids faces and how the AMBER Alert
88:04 happens yes sometimes it's the ex-wife
88:07 or the ex-husband but kids disappear man
88:11 and it fits the regimen of a church then
88:14 you know what do you think Jeffrey
88:16 Epstein got was kids from was this some
88:19 guy gave Jeffrey Epstein triplets 12
88:21 year old triplets as a gift nuts
88:27 freedom of speech well you know what we
88:32 I think have decided as a society but
88:34 it's not talked about too much is that
88:38 there's freedom of speech but you can't
88:41 necessarily go to a kindergarten school
88:44 and start tourette seeing a bunch of bad
88:45 words we're talking about a bunch of
88:48 adult mature topics you can't express
88:51 your shelf self showing a bunch of war
88:53 movies you know the Baghdad highway of
88:57 death to children you know that's not
89:00 free speech stuff there are places where
89:03 you can show that content to people that
89:05 want to watch it and they can tune to a
89:07 channel they can watch a YouTube channel
89:08 and just all that crazy stuff but it
89:12 doesn't mean that you can tell any human
89:14 being on earth everything that's in your
89:16 brain at all times
89:20 but it's one of those furry areas where
89:22 people are kind of like Wayne and Kane
89:24 and can impede on things it's like now
89:26 if I say that you can never say it ever
89:29 to anyone ever even if they want to hear
89:32 it no that's not freedom of speech
89:35 anyway thank you family on this one I
89:37 want to do this episode's been on my
89:39 phone for probably three months I just
89:43 wanted to get sort of an angle I know I
89:44 moved around a little bit there but it
89:46 is a multi-dimensional issue that we're
89:48 dealing with here you I don't know I
89:52 mean I one of the old analogies I used
89:54 to give you probably in season one and
89:57 I'll close on this topic is any of
90:00 you've ever played a video game that was
90:03 hard and there was I remember my cousin
90:08 girl she utterly killed miss pac-man
90:12 killed I mean high scores every frickin
90:16 game she's like 12 years old but we took
90:18 her down to play Donkey Kong once the
90:21 stand-up arcade game and I think most of
90:23 you remember the level with all the
90:26 little little bouncy pads that you could
90:31 run as all girders the whole thing was
90:33 girders and it was this insane level of
90:35 just jumping all these girls you had
90:36 everything perfect and it was so
90:39 extremely difficult
90:41 I don't know how much money she spent on
90:43 this game but she was a pro she took it
90:47 really seriously I've never seen her be
90:49 more serious and it was interesting to
90:51 see the quality and her character come
90:52 out our Jean started activating in her
90:55 it's like or smart do it do it do it and
90:58 I was standing next to her when she
91:01 finally got it through and the whole
91:02 room just came unglued and I think she
91:05 was like 13 14 years old something like
91:07 that and she never felt better in her
91:10 life at that point she was celebrated by
91:13 everyone in the room for her
91:14 perseverance her a hand to eye
91:16 coordination but now think about it what
91:20 if it was one of these loser trophy
91:22 games well you tried you tap the yeah
91:26 you'd have the joystick and you hit the
91:27 button so you automatically get to the
91:28 other side she would walk away from that
91:31 game and never ever play that game ever
91:33 again because they didn't bring her any
91:36 rewards to herself personally and to the
91:38 people around her appreciated her
91:40 perseverance effort is how we become
91:44 human beings in my opinion think about
91:49 how life kissed your ass every single
91:51 day was just talking to a friend of mine
91:53 today I just said life doesn't care she
91:56 goes yeah you're right and I said you
91:59 know the second you tell life that it
92:01 should be fair it laughs at you and it
92:04 says it's always been fair and that's
92:08 the anything could happen the good and
92:11 the bad can happen but you know one of
92:14 the one of the Christian phrases that I
92:16 think people who are even Christian but
92:18 everyone else has heard the phrase too
92:21 is the old phrase god helps those who
92:23 help themselves and that's a phrase we
92:26 really don't like to hear and think
92:29 about because why what does that phrase
92:33 mean in the end effort effort effort
92:38 effort Will Smith you know made this
92:43 video I mentioned it a long time ago he
92:44 made a video on one of the most
92:47 incredibly compelling videos he maybe
92:49 got out of Scientology I don't know but
92:51 he said you know the blame game doesn't
92:54 help anybody
92:55 this is you know what the blame game
92:57 does it says it wastes all of your time
92:59 because he says you can't blame anybody
93:02 and fix something in your life so
93:05 someone breaks your heart
93:08 you could blame that person all you want
93:10 is that gonna put you in another
93:11 successful relationship no in fact it
93:14 probably postpones it way beyond your
93:17 need to blame the person cuz you're
93:19 damaged goods you're just feeling weird
93:21 and you just kind of gotta go well
93:23 there's a lot of fish in the sea men
93:24 there's 7.5 billion people on this
93:26 planet you've probably only dated an
93:29 infant infinitesimal amount of them and
93:32 you think that you've lost your soulmate
93:34 already at like 16 18 20 to 30 maybe did
93:39 find a really good candidate but if it
93:43 didn't work out then that's just all
93:46 that happened I just didn't work out and
93:50 yeah you know when you're in the first
93:51 couple weeks of a broken heart know this
93:53 is gonna make any sense but time will
93:55 fix that whole thing and when you find
93:57 the next person that blows away that
93:59 person that broke your heart oh my god
94:01 it's like that other person never even
94:03 existed but you had convinced yourself
94:05 and I've be speaking from experience
94:06 trust me that that person was it and now
94:11 you may end up never thinking about them
94:14 ever in in your entire lifetime you had
94:17 a broken heart but you're like oh yeah
94:18 oh yeah I did date that person that's
94:20 weird we were talking about getting
94:23 married we were even engaged at one
94:25 point I even think about them anymore
94:27 hmm
94:29 well life goes on anyway I know what you
94:33 think and if you have better ways of
94:36 defending us who have effort as a
94:41 regiment of life

94:46 deep thoughts radio calm please go
