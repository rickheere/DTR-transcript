00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:37 gentlemen so today we're going to
00:39 conduct a very interesting multi-level
00:42 experiment you're going to be aware of
00:44 some of the experiment and you're not
00:46 going to be aware of the other elements
00:47 of the experiment this episode is gonna
00:50 be called that day that's all we're ever
00:54 gonna call it I'm gonna talk in a very
00:58 metaphorical way about that day it might
01:03 take some of you just a few seconds to
01:05 know what I'm talking about others will
01:07 get it right away
01:08 there's a day in the history of anyone
01:11 alive I would say after the and I mean
01:17 cognitively anyone born say 1990 or
01:22 before this day has changed your life
01:28 consciously you were conscious on the
01:31 day that it occurred on the day that
01:34 they happened for some of you you were
01:38 born either after 1990 before this day
01:43 and you could barely remember it or
01:46 you're born after the day and you know
01:51 no other world before this day this day
01:56 is very very important because it is a
02:00 multi-layered day it is the peak of what
02:04 can happen when a people fall asleep for
02:11 decades
02:12 when they're willing to accept a
02:14 marginalized existence in this world
02:16 meaning their sovereign rights yeah
02:21 they're not so conscious of them and
02:25 therefore they get taken away and let me
02:29 give you a silly analogy that you can
02:30 tell other people imagine you had a
02:33 pretty pretty dense house lots of little
02:38 things maybe you're a collector you've
02:41 got crystals or or pottery or dolls or
02:45 star wars figures or whatever but you
02:49 have all kinds of collections in the
02:50 same house so you have just thousands of
02:53 knickknacks and you have this sort of
02:56 coming and going of perhaps neighbors
02:59 and friends or whatever help assistance
03:03 and they all gradually remove items from
03:10 your house that are not in plain sight
03:13 they remove an item that's deep inside
03:16 of a shelf that's sort of in the shadows
03:18 they find a box and they open it up and
03:21 they just simply take something out of
03:23 it you still see the box you don't see
03:27 into the shadows but before you know it
03:30 a couple years agos buy or maybe even a
03:33 decade and it comes time for you to move
03:36 to a better location or maybe you just
03:37 want to rearrange your home you built a
03:40 new extension onto your house and you're
03:42 thinking man I want to get all these
03:43 things that I can't see everything
03:44 that's in the box is everything stuck in
03:46 the shadows and I want to get him over
03:47 to this other room so I can see them and
03:50 all of a sudden you realize they're gone
03:52 because you weren't paying attention and
03:56 then part of you says well I don't want
04:00 to have to pay attention that much my
04:01 god I mean I shouldn't have to inventory
04:03 my entire house just to make sure I
04:05 still possess what I possess those of
04:08 you who live in homes like me you
04:11 probably have a garage a couple boxes in
04:13 there of old things I don't go through
04:16 my old boxes and that's the way our
04:20 Constitution is handled that's the way
04:24 our rights are handled
04:25 in 2018 amazing things are already
04:31 happening and we're just at the tip of
04:34 the iceberg but a lot of what allowed
04:37 this day to occur continued long after
04:41 this day and even grew more complex and
04:45 more acidic to freedom but for the very
04:50 first time in probably 60 some years a
04:56 change is occurring in the United States
04:59 of America it is a beautiful change and
05:03 it is something that is spreading across
05:05 the world as long as it is unimpeded
05:11 you're gonna see things this year that
05:14 you couldn't possibly imagine if you're
05:16 an average citizen and for those of you
05:18 who are fully awake it's the it's the
05:21 year you've been waiting for so the day
05:24 that day I get questions from time to
05:27 time to comment about that day that
05:30 occurred in the past let's review what
05:35 that day contained and this is going to
05:36 be metaphorical because apparently the
05:42 social media corporations that allow
05:45 this information to be posted on their
05:48 web sites have decided to join the
05:52 opposing force of freedom they have
05:56 decided to aid in Abed those individuals
06:00 that don't want you to have your freedom
06:03 they are part of the problem and in a
06:07 way they're employees as well as their
06:09 heads of state should all be charged
06:11 with the violation of this country's
06:14 First Amendment I'm gonna give you a
06:17 quick example when you rent property or
06:19 you apply for a job there are laws that
06:23 guarantee regardless of your race or sex
06:27 at least those two they cannot deny you
06:31 the job of course if there's a job for a
06:35 male model you probably couldn't get it
06:37 if you were a female and vice versa
06:39 but outside those very exceptional
06:42 probably fairly balanced hiring
06:45 regiments no one can stop you legally
06:50 when you open up a corporation inside
06:53 the bound bound arees of the United
06:55 States of America you must abide by the
06:57 Constitution and no policies that you
07:02 can develop otherwise can be implied and
07:06 overridden on to that Constitution
07:10 meaning you can't forbid freedom of
07:13 speech technically speaking within a
07:15 freedom of speech Constitution country
07:19 some of you will remember about half a
07:23 decade ago a couple that was gay went in
07:30 to get a wedding cake made by a person
07:34 who was religious in a Christian way and
07:36 that person decided I am NOT making you
07:39 this cake because I do not sanction what
07:41 you were trying to do which is to get
07:42 married and the ACLU came in and that
07:47 couple sued the bakery a judge swung a
07:51 gavel and said you have to go against
07:53 your religion and make this cake for
07:56 these people that I believe is
07:58 unconstitutional in itself forcing
08:01 someone to do something they don't want
08:02 to do should always be constant
08:04 unconstitutional in a free-market but
08:08 you can see how in one standard they
08:10 enforce it to the nines another standard
08:13 we all look away but the year we have
08:17 always been waiting for is upon us the
08:20 year that we take over and bring back
08:23 balanced freedom the year that we
08:27 educate our kids about having lost that
08:30 freedom and what we have to do to make
08:32 sure that it sticks out worse than India
08:34 atrocity ever glorified in history but
08:38 we're just at the tip of the iceberg a
08:39 lot can happen
08:41 our current leaders who are trying to
08:44 affect this change may be compromised
08:47 physically and we will have to pick up
08:51 the baton and continue running they take
08:54 down one of us we need two of us to
08:56 stand up and own it if they take down
08:58 those two then four of us have to get up
09:00 we need to absolutely crush their bones
09:03 when it comes to trying to hold us down
09:07 with money and shills and people who
09:11 will sell out people who are supposedly
09:14 so mentally fragile they consider
09:17 themselves the disenfranchised the
09:19 snowflakes that day the world changed
09:24 the whole world and ridiculous policy
09:27 still exists as a result of that day
09:29 ridiculous laws exist ridiculous
09:33 executive orders exist in the United
09:36 States of America that day changed the
09:40 way that we are allowed to communicate
09:42 between each other in this world our
09:45 privacy is gone me traveling to you and
09:49 you traveling to me is impeded we must
09:54 grovel and pay money to get back some of
09:58 the freedoms that we used to have on
10:00 that day three structures in New York
10:05 City were obliterated one structure
10:10 outside of Washington DC was damaged and
10:17 four aircraft disappeared we are told
10:22 that nearly 3,000 people disappeared or
10:27 were at least removed from this world
10:30 prior to that day there was no imminent
10:34 threat communicated to the public of any
10:37 kind even though the gentleman who was
10:40 accused of orchestrating the event had
10:43 been mentioned in government travels
10:46 there was no outward
10:50 mass media notification that this person
10:55 might be just about to do something of
10:59 course all that narrative is actually
11:01 untrue to begin with which might be why
11:05 the MSM didn't want to touch it but
11:11 there was a gentleman by the name of
11:12 Bill Cooper who broke the story you see
11:17 this person who was accused of
11:18 orchestrating the event was supposedly
11:22 hunted by our top individuals in our
11:27 government that are supposed to be able
11:28 to find people and incarcerate them
11:31 capture them eliminate them now this
11:36 individual was an asset of our country
11:39 he had been an asset of our country
11:41 since he helped fight the Afghan war
11:44 holding back the Russian invasion of
11:46 Afghanistan there's plenty of videos of
11:49 him holding a walkie-talkie a satellite
11:53 walkie-talkie orchestrating attacks in
11:57 the end the person who does this is
11:59 trying to effect change within the
12:01 paradigm of what they believed to be
12:03 right he was a rich kid
12:05 a very very rich kid he wanted to do
12:08 something wanted to have some fun and
12:11 someone someone offered him the job of
12:14 being the point of contact between our
12:16 country and Afghanistan which was in his
12:21 native world he leapt at the opportunity
12:24 to be important so in the 70s he became
12:30 a hired asset of the United States of
12:32 America the division of which I will let
12:35 you look up but before that day bill
12:41 Cooper was one of the only people in the
12:42 world to put together the fact that our
12:44 military and all of our intelligence
12:46 were unable to find this person
12:48 but then a news network which is
12:53 probably most likened to that of a
12:58 fraudulent news network was able to
13:03 gain access to him fairly effortlessly
13:05 and interview him and this is where they
13:09 began to prime the pump of predictive
13:12 programming for this day putting him
13:15 sort of in the lexicon waking up the
13:17 consciousness of this country and
13:18 perhaps the world to say remember this
13:21 guy he's a little radical we're telling
13:25 you that he's radical his answers to the
13:28 questions weren't exactly that radical
13:30 but the precursor to the interview that
13:33 breaks between the interview and the
13:35 exits summary of the interview branded
13:39 him a chaotic person who would do just
13:42 about anything for his cause and this is
13:46 when Bill Cooper stepped in and said in
13:47 one of his nightly podcasts he said they
13:53 are preparing something they will be
13:57 only acronym des des I should say
14:00 abbreviated prior to the event they
14:04 killed bill Cooper if you don't who that
14:09 is he's an individual that said that he
14:12 was on a naval ship I believe in the 60s
14:16 I think it was 67 ish and he said that
14:20 he was standing on the deck of the ship
14:22 performing his guard duty this will make
14:25 you roll your eyes a little bit
14:26 depending on what you where you come
14:28 from but there's sort of an interesting
14:33 summary to the end of this story as well
14:35 other than his assassination to cover up
14:39 events that we're going to precede this
14:42 day the bill Cooper said that he saw the
14:47 ocean open up and the black of night and
14:50 I want you to think about the notion led
14:54 only by moonlight and dimly so a
14:59 gentleman standing on the deck of a ship
15:00 and looking out and seeing a orifice
15:05 about the portion of an eyeball opening
15:08 up it's deep the water is now going down
15:12 into this slit and he said vehicles
15:17 left the ocean and flew into the sky
15:19 with no noise whatsoever
15:21 and there were multiple of them two or
15:24 three he is utterly in shock and he is
15:28 stunned before he could call out back to
15:33 the command central as I remember the
15:35 story it happened again except they're
15:37 coming out of the sky
15:39 they would have peered that different
15:41 ones were going back in just swallowed
15:45 up into the ocean no splash no nothing
15:49 silent he calls into the central command
15:53 inside the ship and says guys I just saw
15:55 something really strange the ship was
15:58 like well we just tracked something
15:59 strange and within a few hours the ship
16:02 was visited by helicopter dropping off
16:05 individuals and black suits that said
16:08 you're not to tell anyone any of this
16:10 and they swore everyone who was involved
16:13 to a gag order
16:16 but eventually bill was pulled into this
16:20 program that monitors such events and he
16:24 spent probably the better part of three
16:26 decades inside this program researching
16:29 things reading things being told things
16:31 and after he popped out in about 1995 he
16:36 said I may have been duped the entire
16:40 time saved the initial event that I saw
16:42 what I saw could have been our stuff
16:44 could have been out of this world but it
16:46 that first part definitely happened
16:48 because everything after that was simply
16:49 told to me or I was shown photographs so
16:52 he's an eccentric individual and for
16:56 whatever reason seeing that as a young
16:59 man as a soldier opened his mind he was
17:03 no longer looking at things as it was
17:06 being as they were being dictated to him
17:07 he was inaugurated into an organization
17:11 that said the world isn't what you think
17:12 it is and once you open up that critical
17:15 thinking you can never close it unless
17:17 someone hit you on the head or gives you
17:18 shock treatment and a bunch of chemicals
17:20 to burn out your brain you will always
17:21 be lucid once you become lucid less
17:25 toxicity and age robbed you of that
17:28 the day before that day a very
17:31 interesting thing happened because Donna
17:33 Rumsfeld came out and announced to the
17:35 public that the Pentagon had lost 2.2
17:38 trillion dollars the initial number was
17:41 four point four trillion dollars and to
17:45 put that in perspective I think the
17:47 whole military operations since 2003 has
17:52 cost Americans about what two to three
17:56 trillion dollars so this was a big
17:59 amount of money and on that day that
18:01 investigation was completely erased
18:04 because one of the structures that were
18:05 that was struck at all the investigation
18:09 papers put on that side of the structure
18:10 intentionally such that when it was
18:12 struck in it burned all the
18:15 investigation paperwork was lost and the
18:18 law firm that was actually investigating
18:22 in air quotes was in a building in New
18:24 York that also met an early demise the
18:29 building that suffered no direct impact
18:34 that caused the other two much larger
18:37 buildings to have a problem our leader
18:41 was visiting a group of school kids he
18:46 was out of the pocket when the event
18:49 kicked off an aircraft supposedly
18:52 impacted a structure in New York City
18:57 supposedly filmed by a film crew
19:02 covering some incidental work by I
19:04 believe a fire department the public
19:06 recalls it incorrectly in terms of
19:08 seeing the footage of this film crew the
19:12 public thinks that we have that footage
19:14 right away
19:15 especially now since it's been many
19:17 years since this day the truth of the
19:19 matter is is that we didn't get that
19:21 footage for a couple days because I
19:23 remember waiting for it waiting for
19:26 something approximately an hour later
19:30 allegedly another aircraft drops out of
19:33 the sky and hits the second structure it
19:37 is dramatic
19:38 it is a shock and awe moment if there
19:41 ever was one but interestingly enough
19:45 out of all the individuals I've ever met
19:47 that said they were there and that they
19:49 saw these events occur especially the
19:51 second event when I truly pinned them
19:54 down to say did you actually see it with
19:57 your own eyes they said well yeah I was
20:02 downstairs watching it on a television I
20:04 was in my house watching it on a
20:06 television I am personally yet to meet a
20:10 person who witnessed this this vehicle
20:15 in this guy impact the structure they
20:20 all think they did because they want to
20:22 be a part of the heroic archetype of
20:24 this story in one way and I I don't mean
20:27 to criticize it's not a criticism at all
20:29 it is simply if you endured the horror
20:32 of that day and you survived you've got
20:34 to give yourself some merit some credit
20:39 the closer you are to an event like this
20:41 the more shocking it is to your system
20:43 and if you can survive with a steady
20:47 mind then you have succeeded in one way
20:49 or another so hats off to you once each
20:55 structure had suffered the initial
20:57 strike things started to happen sounds
21:03 started to come out of the basement of
21:04 these structures sounds that are very
21:07 indicative of explosives booms and roars
21:14 big plumes of clouds coming out of the
21:17 bottom of these structures out of every
21:19 single opening and orifice just pouring
21:22 out smoke here and there people unseen
21:25 attempted to report this information
21:27 some of the recordings of their
21:30 eyewitness testimony have survived the
21:34 huge sweep of organizations that went in
21:38 and said if you film this we demand your
21:41 footage we demand your camera we demand
21:44 your hard drives your memory cards
21:47 whatever you used we demand it and we
21:50 will censor it and give it back to you
21:53 and that's how a lot of things were
21:56 erased further south and the westerns of
22:00 DC area a similar situation occurred at
22:05 least as in the official story a vehicle
22:09 supposedly struck a structure same type
22:13 of vehicle and supposedly hit two other
22:15 structures north in a fourth situation
22:22 we have a vehicle that landed in
22:27 Cleveland Ohio was taxi to a specific
22:31 hangar not owned by the airport in which
22:35 it was a part of individuals were taken
22:40 off the plane and the plane then left
22:43 and then it was reported that this plane
22:46 never landed and that this heroic
22:49 situation occurred where the occupants
22:51 of the plane
22:52 decided to fight back and when they did
22:55 the individual who had taken over and
22:57 commandeered the plane flew it
23:00 erratically one report said upside down
23:03 and it was said to have crashed into a
23:06 tiny sliver in the soil of which has
23:10 been later confirmed as already existing
23:12 two years earlier by the farmer that dug
23:14 it no wreckage nothing indicative of
23:18 what we have seen in recent events in
23:21 2018 with a plane that was knocked out
23:28 of the sky to eliminate one informant we
23:32 have seen aircraft that have crashed
23:35 into mountains we've seen it there are
23:39 tail sections and engines
23:41 there's always engines big giant
23:44 twenty-eight thousand pound titanium
23:47 engines you can't get rid of that you
23:52 could you could let it drop straight out
23:53 of the sky you get to put a rocket on
23:56 its back and push it into a wall and
23:58 they're still going to be recognizable
24:00 debris in one case in New York they said
24:05 they found such a
24:06 such an engine but when examined it
24:08 wasn't there nearly the size that needed
24:11 to be and wasn't made by the
24:12 manufacturer
24:13 that made the engines and the other
24:15 vehicles the initial impact to the
24:19 building in Washington DC left a very
24:22 round hole in the side of the building
24:25 and penetrated three interior rings or
24:28 two interior rings the external ring and
24:29 then two others very similar to an event
24:32 that we had seen in the 90s when once a
24:36 Lobaton Milosevic had his house hit by
24:40 other weapons the drop out of the bottom
24:44 of planes that are launched from
24:45 submarines that are launched from
24:48 destroyers the first eyewitness in
24:52 Washington DC said he saw a missile with
24:56 wings
24:56 it was very adamant about that and that
25:00 he was outside the building when the
25:02 event occurred when he was interviewed
25:05 four hours later he said he was inside
25:07 the building changing his location and
25:10 that it was most definitely a certain
25:13 brand of airline that he absolutely did
25:19 not mistaken at supposedly four hundred
25:24 and fifty miles an hour what the side of
25:26 this thing said I challenge you to stand
25:30 on the ground and have ten of these
25:33 vehicles fly by with different paint
25:35 jobs on the fuselage and you're
25:38 literally a ground level and you're
25:39 seeing these things fly eight up eight
25:41 feet over the ground or one foot over
25:43 the ground at 450 miles an hour I put
25:49 you in a little safe bunker but you need
25:50 to read which one went by in each one of
25:54 the instances and I'm willing to bet you
25:56 can't do it now we don't need to recall
25:58 every single event of the particular day
26:00 because we know how it went don't we the
26:03 second structure impacted fell first
26:05 the first structure impact fell second
26:09 and a third structure in New York that
26:12 was never hit by anything fell into its
26:16 own footprint
26:18 to most likely a very orchestrated
26:21 process all three the structures were
26:25 able to fall into their footprint as if
26:30 they had no structure underneath them
26:32 holding them up the structure in DC well
26:38 it had some additional help because
26:43 prior to the actual event that is
26:46 officially recorded in history they had
26:49 a I should say an event that occurred
26:53 five minutes before which compromised
26:57 the structures integrity set fires to
27:00 the building and was most likely
27:04 responsible for a few fatalities
27:06 internally and they were responding to
27:09 this other event in that building five
27:11 minutes before the official story event
27:15 that happened to it now the bummer of
27:18 this day and there are several bummers
27:20 at this day is that science will tell us
27:25 that that day could not have occurred
27:27 the way that we witnessed it to have
27:29 occurred as related to the official
27:32 story we witnessed what occurred nothing
27:36 can take that away we did not witness a
27:39 structure in DC and all of the
27:43 eyewitnesses save those who are really
27:45 paying attention on that particular day
27:47 none of which I've hourly met we all saw
27:51 it through the eyes of a television feed
27:53 which means that what we saw was
27:57 manipulated and changed before we saw it
28:00 the individuals that orchestrated this
28:03 were exceptionally brilliant people most
28:08 likely sociopathic people who are
28:10 willing to trade their own valor their
28:13 own demented demonic valor among each
28:17 other for the ultimate drop of dopamine
28:22 and adrenaline that any human being has
28:26 ever experienced in their life for if
28:29 someone can be happy to see such a thing
28:31 occur
28:32 we can scientifically say they are
28:35 without conscious conscience they are
28:39 without any belief in a God other they
28:43 can't conceive of what's after this life
28:45 or they simply have dabbled in a little
28:48 bit and decided there's nothing after
28:50 this or they believe in a completely
28:56 different story that undoing life
28:59 undoing freedom is going to be rewarded
29:03 in that afterlife by entities that
29:09 typically we do not endorse the question
29:14 of who exactly did it would probably fit
29:18 in a dossier it would fit in a large
29:21 document if you knew all of the truth of
29:23 who was involved in this event of that
29:26 day it would imply and implicate excuse
29:30 me a lot of people who never get in
29:34 front of a microphone who are never
29:36 interviewed by anyone and who are
29:39 extremely loyal to the byproduct of that
29:42 day and therefore keeping it a secret is
29:47 not a problem their entire life is a
29:51 secret their entire existence is that
29:56 devotion and it always has been
29:59 they don't have to learn how to keep a
30:01 secret they are a secret for most of us
30:05 honest people which is 99.999% of the
30:09 world we live in truth every day because
30:12 we don't like cancer we don't like that
30:15 feeling of angst and holding in a lie
30:17 but that remaining percentage that
30:21 fraction of a fraction of a percent of
30:23 individuals that are raised in these
30:25 certain families they don't have to keep
30:28 a secret because they never talk to
30:29 anyone about it who doesn't already know
30:31 about their secret it's only secret to
30:34 us because we don't know what they do
30:35 but we have endorsed and glamorized
30:39 organizations that keep themselves
30:41 hidden don't we haven't we up until
30:45 probably the last 15 years as the
30:47 awakening has started to accelerate we
30:51 now know them to be more diabolical and
30:54 more evil than we ever thought they were
30:57 and now we know that they actually have
31:01 posed a threat to us ever since they
31:04 conceived of themselves ever since they
31:07 chartered their life to oppose ours
31:11 there's a great movie by Pixar called
31:13 bug's life and I used to talk about this
31:15 a lot in season 1 and it's a good time
31:17 to remember this movie and if for those
31:19 of you who missed it this won't spoil
31:22 anything for you you're not probably
31:24 likely to go back and watch an old 3d
31:27 cartoon the Pixar snuck out a great
31:32 story and it's been told several times
31:34 but I actually think but for my money
31:36 bugs life pound-for-pound tells the
31:40 story more accurately than any sort of
31:44 OnPoint movie I've ever seen which is
31:48 that there are millions and millions and
31:51 millions of ants all living their little
31:55 lives
31:55 living good lives being honest to each
31:58 other in this particular story and that
32:02 a few grasshoppers which are bigger and
32:06 definitely capable of conquering an ant
32:09 one on one come in and start killing and
32:13 pillaging and wreaking havoc on this ant
32:16 community and then the ants cower down
32:19 to the grasshoppers the grasshoppers
32:23 actually aren't that smart they're smart
32:26 enough to impose their muscle they're
32:31 smart enough to take advantage of the
32:35 good nature of these ants to convince
32:38 them to surrender all their sovereignty
32:41 and all their rights but eventually by
32:44 the end of the film obviously the main
32:46 character realizes that there are a lot
32:49 more ants than there are grasshoppers a
32:51 lot more and they fight back and they
32:54 win
32:54 you've seen this in three amigos you've
32:57 seen this of all kinds of films Tron
33:00 uprising was another example which was
33:03 cancelled because it was bringing this
33:06 archetype to every one's knowledge that
33:09 the few can you know they're sorry the
33:11 mini can defeat the few the blue can
33:13 defeat the red after this day there were
33:18 a couple other events that were
33:20 synthesized into existence that
33:22 continued to erode our ability to travel
33:26 freely you don't have to get undressed
33:30 partially to get on to an aircraft all
33:34 because of fake events that never
33:36 occurred an individual is supposedly
33:40 fiddled with his shoes and did a
33:43 piss-poor job of pulling off the event
33:46 but that one person that one person
33:51 changed the entire planet how many
33:55 billions of times has he have human
33:57 beings been asked to take off their
33:58 shoes as a result of that fake event the
34:02 event that occurred which was never
34:04 supposed to succeed but was supposed to
34:05 inject into our world the necessity to
34:10 take our shoes off another fake event 27
34:16 men were accused in London New London
34:19 England of bringing on liquids onto a
34:25 plane that could have destroyed the
34:27 point I was up the night that the story
34:30 broke the 27 was then reduced to seven
34:33 the seven were detained and the seven
34:37 were released because it never happened
34:39 but it happened in a foreign country if
34:41 you're an American it didn't happen in
34:43 our country who paid the price well
34:47 around the world you can no longer take
34:50 a certain amount of liquid onto a plane
34:53 they don't care about what they're
34:56 trying to proverbially protect you from
34:59 they only care about conditioning us
35:02 into giving up our rights in the name of
35:05 some Liberty
35:07 giving up freedom which is the same
35:09 thing as the freedom that is taken away
35:12 I had to explain to me by an individual
35:17 he said you know the difference between
35:19 freedom and liberty and I said it's the
35:20 same thing and he goes no because
35:22 Liberty is freedom from your government
35:24 and freedom is just freedom as a result
35:29 of this day if you really think about it
35:33 millions of people in this world no
35:35 longer exist a couple at least they are
35:41 gone they are dead as a result of this
35:45 day but there are tens of millions of
35:48 people who are suffering grave
35:50 consequences as a result of this day and
35:54 I'm not talking about people have to
35:56 take off their shoes all of a sudden I'm
35:57 talking about people who have had their
35:59 countries destroyed their schools their
36:03 hospitals that roads their bridges
36:04 destroyed accused of being involved with
36:08 this day when they had nothing to do
36:10 with this day and their leadership had
36:12 nothing to do with this day regardless
36:14 of their leadership would have thought
36:16 the day was good or bad they had no
36:18 direct involvement unfortunately a bunch
36:21 of good souls have been convinced that
36:25 the souls that aren't involved should be
36:28 punished and should be killed and should
36:30 be destroyed as a result of that day
36:32 sold a bill of goods that if you don't
36:36 understand a particular human in this
36:39 world then they are part of the group
36:42 that made this day happen and it's
36:44 better that you eliminate them out of
36:47 complete confusion instead of taking the
36:50 risk that that language that you can
36:51 understand might be trading information
36:54 that'll make that day happen again now
36:58 when you first start waking up to that
36:59 day most of you have probably completed
37:02 a decade at least full consciousness of
37:05 that day being fraudulent and we
37:07 mentioned it all the time on the show
37:08 but this particular video we're gonna
37:11 leave out its name you get swept away by
37:15 all the factual anomalies meaning things
37:18 that you were told that happened on that
37:20 day the
37:20 you find out scientifically are probably
37:22 impossible all kinds of countries were
37:26 involved in that day outside of our
37:28 country one of the narratives that's
37:31 going on is that the individuals that
37:34 were said to have participated as the
37:38 drivers I should say of the vehicles all
37:43 had their identification map back to a
37:45 particular country which is well-known
37:47 for oil exports when investigated we
37:52 found out that at least 51% of these
37:56 individuals were alive and well as
37:58 identified by the official narrative and
38:02 so the government simply said well their
38:05 identification was confiscated and used
38:08 by other individuals so right away 51 to
38:13 60 percent of these individuals are
38:14 completely mysterious to us because the
38:16 faces and names that were offered to us
38:19 as the individuals who participated in
38:21 are not those individuals because
38:22 they're alive and well no one seems to
38:25 care for anyone that was really involved
38:28 you can probably guarantee yourself they
38:31 have been eliminated from this planet as
38:33 a matter of a contingency to make sure
38:35 that they never show up anywhere else
38:37 being filmed by someone and to make sure
38:40 they don't run their mouth about what
38:41 they know to help us piece together the
38:43 puzzles puzzle pieces to see what
38:46 actually did occur in the end it's it's
38:51 a situation like this there are so many
38:55 smoking guns that prove that the
38:57 official story of that day did not
38:59 actually occur that all you need as an
39:02 individual is one one that convinces you
39:05 that what you were told
39:07 didn't occur and then you can move on
39:09 with life as of this year 2018 where
39:14 you'll finally have the individuals and
39:16 the groups largely revealed we've had
39:20 the governments and the institutions
39:21 within those governments who are
39:23 extremely corrupt identified
39:26 and now it's the slow process of
39:30 building the case against them such that
39:34 when they are tried they are not tried
39:36 in a normal courtroom with a jury that
39:39 can be coerced and programmed to give a
39:44 testimony of favorable results to those
39:47 criminals that we pull them into what's
39:52 called a military tribunal a military
39:54 trial where there is no jury where the
39:58 facts must just be analyzed the verdicts
40:01 handed down in the incarceration or
40:04 capital punishment is served for those
40:08 of you wondering why the criminals that
40:09 we know exist in this country that I'm
40:12 in right now have not been charged
40:14 that's what's going on the case is being
40:17 built to make sure there's no jury these
40:22 individuals have committed such
40:24 egregious crimes of treason there's an
40:28 old tactic that's been used for
40:30 millennia and that is if you're going to
40:34 build a criminal organization one of the
40:37 things you have to make sure is that
40:38 anyone is then on the team is
40:40 compromised that you have some dirt on
40:43 them such that if they want to run their
40:47 mouth you release that information on
40:49 them and discredit them but you don't
40:53 really want to get to that point so you
40:54 let them know that you've got that dirt
40:56 on them and they tend to behave absolute
40:59 we can assume that once these
41:01 individuals are involved they're
41:03 compromised right but we tend to think
41:06 of it as a single individual a person
41:10 who's compromised but this type of event
41:13 is such a big event and requires a level
41:17 of suspension of disbelief that is so
41:20 intense if you have just the smallest
41:24 level of intelligence whether it be
41:29 physics or engineering or both
41:30 metallurgy Aeronautics explosives when
41:35 you have knowledge in those areas just a
41:37 basic amount you have a big giant
41:40 through
41:40 coming out of a big sweater and it's
41:42 it's big enough to put two hands on it
41:44 and yank it's big enough to tie it to
41:47 the hitch of your truck and drive off
41:48 and then Ravel that sweater and that's
41:51 what's occurred it's not just an
41:53 individual who knew what happened that
41:55 day it's other countries that with
41:57 Armada of scientists that could pick it
42:00 apart and how do you get them to be
42:02 quiet you involve them you work out a
42:09 deal you say if you're willing to keep
42:12 your mouth shut you can be involved in
42:15 this and you can benefit from this
42:16 economically and socially the economic
42:21 benefits are pretty straightforward
42:22 whatever resources we can gain as a
42:25 result of this day which is usually the
42:28 energy that we use the substance we use
42:30 to create energy in this world and make
42:31 a lot of money you're gonna get it out
42:34 of disk and out discount you know but
42:37 more popular to these organizations and
42:41 these countries or at least the corrupt
42:43 factions within these countries they get
42:46 control and how do they get control
42:49 because that day gave the impression
42:54 that we aren't safe and we are allowing
43:00 Liberty to go away which is the freedom
43:04 from your government we're allowing the
43:06 governments to swoop in and take control
43:09 giving up in the end the pure commodity
43:14 that is freedom now all of us have our
43:18 different stories about that day I will
43:22 share two personal experiences that I
43:25 have had that provided a magnifying
43:30 glass on two of the smoking guns that
43:36 many of you already know about but it's
43:40 better than someone telling you that
43:42 they saw a YouTube video or they saw
43:44 some article and then regurgitating it
43:47 back to you right so this is these are
43:49 two events that occurred to me heard to
43:52 me excuse me
43:53 but I want to share I've had a very
43:56 close friend who was very close to the
44:00 architect that designed the structures
44:04 the two tallest structures that were
44:07 involved in this those structures were
44:10 so tall that one of the chief questions
44:12 asked by all of those that had to
44:14 approve the structures was what happens
44:16 if a vehicle that flies impacts the
44:19 structure how do you guarantee that this
44:22 won't have a horrible catastrophic
44:25 cascading effect on the structure thus
44:27 bringing it down in the architects said
44:31 we design this structure with that in
44:33 mind the designer designed this
44:37 structure to survive five direct impacts
44:41 from the largest vehicle that flies in
44:45 the air at that time fully loaded and
44:48 with both fuel and passengers which is
44:52 only 75 pounds less than the actual
44:57 impacts that occurred let's rewind that
45:01 so you can understand a single point of
45:04 contact not multiple points of contact
45:06 but the same exact spot would have to or
45:10 sure it was actually designed to survive
45:13 five vehicles back-to-back one two three
45:17 four five now think about that
45:21 I took me a while to say didn't it
45:23 they're never gonna come in that quick
45:26 but it could survive five direct impacts
45:29 into the same location yet one not fully
45:35 loaded aircraft supposedly flew at
45:40 speeds that are not possible at sea
45:44 level
45:45 hit the structures and they fell
45:48 freefall the architect proceeded to
45:51 continue with his answer elaborating
45:54 these structures are so absolutely
45:56 strong that you could pick it up if you
45:59 were a giant and shake it and put it
46:01 back down and it would be 99.9 percent
46:04 exactly as strong as it was
46:06 provided you could reattach it to the
46:08 ground properly as it was before you
46:10 shook it that's how absolutely strong
46:14 those structures were built that's a
46:16 first degree witness asking the
46:20 architect the question elaborating on it
46:23 for 15 to 30 minutes and concluding the
46:27 conversation and I know the individual
46:30 first degree who had the conversation
46:33 second event that occurred to me I was
46:37 at a television set as a guest of the
46:42 host who hosted the show on this show
46:46 they were building aircraft three of
46:49 them because anything that flies
46:52 anything that leaves the ground and then
46:55 under its own propulsion is a flying
46:58 vehicle the FAA has to certify that
47:02 vehicle before any attempt to fly occurs
47:05 to ensure that the occupants or occupant
47:08 / pilot of the vehicle is going to be
47:11 safe to a certain minimum degree I was
47:16 eating lunch with two of these
47:17 individuals from the FAA we had a little
47:21 tiny table at this set we're outside
47:24 it's a beautiful summer day it's nice
47:26 and warm I'm the fifth wheel because on
47:30 the other side of the table are two of
47:31 the world's most celebrated stunt pilots
47:35 who have done everything crazy stunt
47:39 flying of prop planes the guys that get
47:41 out on the wings and stand there and
47:43 crawl around guys who switch planes in
47:46 mid-flight I mean these guys know
47:48 everything about planes they started
47:51 having a conversation with each other
47:53 about that day they said what do you
47:55 think about that day and they all kind
47:59 of looked around and they looked at each
48:00 other and things got a little somber a
48:02 little strange and those eyeballs that
48:05 went back and forth between essentially
48:08 top guns individuals that know more
48:12 about aviation and most people in the
48:14 world and it was strange to me because I
48:18 was completely asleep
48:20 the official story was all I knew about
48:22 that day and it wasn't until about a
48:26 year later that I had any level of
48:28 awakening and I had completely forgotten
48:30 this conversation until much later but
48:33 they looked at each other and it was
48:36 that look of like are you asking me this
48:39 question because you don't believe what
48:41 happened that day or asked me that
48:43 question because you know something they
48:46 regarded grown men I think they were
48:50 probably in their late 40s early 50s and
48:53 there was this weird stare at each other
48:56 it was interesting I'm being very quiet
48:59 I don't say a word because I don't know
49:01 anything other than what I was told on
49:03 television and one of the stunt pilots
49:05 said well you know the week after that
49:08 day I went and rented time in a
49:12 simulator a flight simulator and I
49:16 dialed up the vehicle that was supposed
49:17 to have accomplished the second impact
49:19 on the structure now I attempted 11
49:24 times to pull that off and not only was
49:29 it well he basically just said it wasn't
49:33 he was not capable of pulling off the
49:36 maneuver and he's one of the best pilots
49:37 in the world and he just got commercial
49:40 flight time as well just so you know
49:43 that's his main job as I understand it
49:45 he was very quiet very muted when he
49:48 said all this it wasn't excited wasn't a
49:51 guy that tells the eight-foot eight-foot
49:54 fish story right and the FAA guy that
49:58 started the conversation paused then he
50:01 said yeah me too he quoted how many
50:05 times he tried it was over half a dozen
50:07 times it was nearly eleven times he says
50:11 I couldn't do it either and that's
50:14 pretty much where the conversation ended
50:16 it was a way of four guys talking to
50:19 each other and saying something smells
50:21 bad now more recently in the last five
50:26 years probably last two years to be
50:29 honest journalists
50:31 individuals that want to investigate the
50:33 true facts of a story have made phone
50:35 calls sort of a double blinded
50:38 conversation with pilots and said how
50:41 fast can you go with sea level in this
50:43 particular type of plane not referring
50:45 to that day whatsoever acting like a
50:48 student of the art of aviation and then
50:53 they called several individuals and
50:54 recorded the conversation which was then
50:57 turned into a video that was posted
50:58 online every answer was that you can't
51:01 do it you can't get over I think the the
51:08 amount that was the maximum the speed I
51:10 believe was quoted at Sundberg between
51:12 250 to 275 nautical miles per hour
51:15 because the air is too thick and so the
51:19 student / journalist said well what if
51:23 you wanted to what if you just threw
51:27 down the throttles and you say go go go
51:30 especially what if you use the momentum
51:33 of falling from a higher altitude down
51:35 to the lower altitude could you could
51:37 you pull it off then and the answer came
51:40 back unanimously you'd rip the wings off
51:43 you'd rip the wings off the plane would
51:45 disintegrate and there's no way that
51:46 this could have occurred this could
51:49 occur I should say which to us means it
51:51 couldn't have occurred now for those of
51:54 you are very familiar with that day
51:55 you're gonna have a little angst in your
51:58 body right now if not a tremendous
51:59 amount of angst in your body and it's
52:01 going to be driven by one thing which is
52:04 come on dude talk about all of it talk
52:08 about my favorite smoking gun that day I
52:10 have to apologize my neighbor is working
52:13 on something on his house and so he's
52:15 using a grinder in his backyard I'm
52:17 gonna mention two more things for sure I
52:20 might mention more but one can sit in
52:25 contest science right because what a
52:27 science turned into in this world
52:28 science has turned into theoretical
52:30 science in most cases it's the most
52:32 glamorous because like I've said many of
52:34 my other science-based episodes you can
52:37 tell yourself anything on a piece of
52:39 paper you can event complete different
52:41 paradigms of existence on a piece of
52:43 paper you don't have to prove anything
52:45 no one's allowed to touch you oh they
52:47 can criticize you and peer-review your
52:49 paper and what-have-you but you don't
52:51 have to prove anything so someone could
52:54 come in and come up with another theory
52:56 on paper as to why all the things that
52:58 we know the architects and engineers
53:01 with PhDs and all relative technologies
53:04 have said is impossible that day you can
53:07 contest it can't you
53:09 the answer is yes you could contest it
53:11 you can contest that two plus two equals
53:13 four how many lights do you see they ask
53:17 per card taken from 1984 there were
53:22 three individuals who witnessed the
53:24 event who filmed the event over a body
53:28 of water from a very safe distance and
53:31 as these events unfolded in New York
53:35 City they celebrated they jumped up and
53:39 down on top of their vehicle a van and
53:44 they celebrated each time an impact
53:47 occurred but they extra celebrated each
53:51 time that the structures fell they were
53:53 reported to the authorities they were
53:55 detained and then they were released at
53:58 that point it was just a suspicious
54:00 group of kids all in their 20s filming
54:04 this with video cameras celebrating each
54:06 event and you could you could say to
54:09 yourself well they're just deranged
54:11 children who celebrate in the loss of
54:14 others and those kids are out there but
54:16 then those kids went home to their home
54:18 country which is not the United States
54:20 of America they were interviewed on a
54:23 television show that's very similar just
54:25 something you might see on MTV and they
54:27 were questioned about why they were
54:30 celebrating this event and why they got
54:33 arrested in the first place and one of
54:36 them said on national television aired
54:38 across the world and recorded on many
54:40 DVRs and republished on YouTube that
54:46 they were there merely to document the
54:48 day to document the event that is a
54:51 smoking gun of admission not a smoking
54:53 gun of science it shows that they had
54:57 foreknowledge of the event
54:59 their employment was linked back to a
55:02 very similar type of corrupt
55:04 organization in their country that we
55:06 believe was involved on our side of the
55:08 fence
55:09 it's a smoking gun that doesn't require
55:11 any scientific method to contradict the
55:15 interesting thing is that our fraudulent
55:19 news organizations did not cover it in
55:22 any detail never became a front-page
55:25 story never became the the grounds of
55:28 for a gigantic investigation they were
55:32 allowed to return to normal life being
55:37 sort of participants in one way or
55:40 another
55:40 I don't believe personally that they
55:44 actually participated in the mechanics
55:48 that made the a day occurred necessarily
55:50 perhaps they were but they wouldn't have
55:51 to have been to be completely guilty of
55:54 the day's events later the vehicle was
56:00 commandeered obviously as part of the
56:04 apprehension of these individuals and it
56:06 was tested and the forensics evidence
56:09 came back glaring the vehicle that they
56:12 were standing on top of was definitely a
56:14 part of the day for the substances they
56:16 found in the back of this vehicle tested
56:19 positive for what might be the chemical
56:22 structures that participated in the
56:24 ultimate demise of these structures it
56:27 was linked back to some company that had
56:31 also had its CEO flee the country before
56:37 that day or soon after but there's a
56:41 fourth one that's always stuck in my
56:43 head and it was reported in a film that
56:45 was very very popular that its name has
56:49 the implication of available coinage
56:54 let's just put it that way
56:56 ancillary coinage and they reported that
56:59 a silo was demolished within a
57:05 comfortable amount of time prior to this
57:08 day and I think it was just loosely
57:10 insinuated that perhaps that was a test
57:12 and I don't believe that at all having
57:15 come from the Midwest and entered silos
57:18 for greeneries and a bunch of other uses
57:21 facilities they're empty they're big
57:25 giant empty buildings if you needed a
57:29 place to stage this operation if you
57:31 needed a place to put together the
57:33 actual substances that were used for
57:35 this particular day that would have been
57:37 at a beautiful staging area when it's
57:42 over
57:42 you simply demolish it and you erase the
57:45 staging area
57:46 if you demolish it then the chemicals
57:49 that would be traced back to this
57:51 particular day we would be all over the
57:55 place in an explained way because the
57:57 structure was actually brought down by
57:59 those chemicals hmm technically probably
58:03 not the case but it would be enough that
58:06 someone could insinuate a and you found
58:08 these chemicals that's what we used in
58:10 part in theory on the periodic table of
58:13 chemicals can do this kind of thing
58:15 let's say you shouldn't worry about it
58:18 so then the whole thing splits in half
58:22 for those of you are angered about that
58:24 day eats a little you know hole in your
58:28 heart I would beg you to let that go
58:31 don't let their event do any more harm
58:34 to you genetically and mentally than it
58:37 already has be free of it let it go what
58:41 time really exists then now that's the
58:44 only time that really exists oh you can
58:46 theorize about events that you've had in
58:48 your past because you have this database
58:50 in the universe that you can access will
58:53 let you remember your past but you got
58:56 to move on you got to live in the now
58:59 here are the facts most likely about
59:02 this particular day this is the split
59:05 and two situation the first thing you
59:08 need to come to grips with and you you
59:11 should be able to sleep at night the
59:14 individuals that participated in this
59:15 particular day will most likely all get
59:18 away scot-free from us
59:22 they will exit this world without any
59:24 penalisation of their existence as you
59:28 know I've theorized several times about
59:30 what happens after this life
59:32 none of us officially know there are
59:35 some pretty strong indicators that there
59:37 is a phase after this life and there's
59:39 probably a phase before this life and
59:41 it's probably been a phase that's been
59:42 going in a loop ever since we conceived
59:45 of this particular existence whether or
59:48 not there are penalties on the other
59:49 side of this phase we don't know maybe
59:53 it's a game maybe it doesn't matter what
59:55 we do because it just goes in a big loop
59:57 and you get taken out one way one time
60:01 you get taken out another way any other
60:02 time maybe you're killed by a criminal
60:04 maybe you just pass away out of old age
60:08 we've said in several episodes on this
60:11 show that you have to have evil to no
60:14 good
60:15 well if there's any accolade to these
60:19 people whatsoever is that they have done
60:21 a beautiful job heightening our
60:22 awareness of good for they have forged
60:25 their souls out of pure concentrated
60:29 evil if they are to pray for anything
60:32 after this life it is that God does not
60:34 exist that there is no real measure of a
60:39 soul that you can merely do whatever you
60:42 want to do in this world and die and be
60:45 forgiven and come back and you can be
60:47 just as much of a bastard in your next
60:50 life is you were in the previous one I
60:52 think most of us would like to believe
60:54 that there is something very strong and
60:56 very definitive about behaving like that
61:00 as soon as one passes and that there's
61:02 somehow some justice on the other side
61:04 there are various religions that believe
61:06 if you commit such crimes on society
61:09 that you are damned for several
61:12 iterations back to this world who knows
61:15 but they are going to get away scot-free
61:18 they will if nothing else the
61:22 individuals who participated in this
61:23 that are commonly named as participants
61:26 in this they were old when this whole
61:27 thing occurred and it's been several
61:30 years since this occurred right over a
61:32 decade in a few years it will be too
61:36 decades and they'll be dead they'll be
61:40 dead through natural causes but even if
61:43 you drug them into some penitentiary
61:46 some sort of incarceration perhaps even
61:49 humming them at the end of a Gallo they
61:52 lived most their life the way they
61:53 wanted to live it they've had all this
61:55 spoils of deceit and ill-gotten gains
61:58 that you could possibly gain out of this
62:00 world if Christianity has any bearing on
62:03 what happens after this world then the
62:06 next phase of their life is going to be
62:09 one of unimaginable torment maybe that's
62:15 right I don't know but the other half of
62:20 this day is to itemize what has happened
62:24 since this day that needs to be reversed
62:27 the lunacy the craziness the war and the
62:32 death the rationale to hurt another
62:35 human being I should say rationales we
62:40 have to do what we can to undo the
62:45 infectious ideas that came out of that
62:47 day I was completely and utterly swept
62:52 away by the next 12 months after that
62:54 day of wanting to retaliate on who they
62:59 told me was responsible for that day
63:02 there was an individual I mentioned in a
63:05 previous episode who lived in the
63:07 neighborhood I lived in he had a big
63:10 truck big old American truck and he put
63:14 two gigantic American flags just behind
63:17 the cab preceding the you know the back
63:20 bucket area of the truck but he also put
63:24 two signs on his car one in front of the
63:27 radiator and one behind the glass of his
63:31 cab how he backed up I'll never know and
63:33 the signs read two words Newcombe and he
63:39 drove around and people honked and
63:41 screamed and yelled were all very happy
63:43 to see that truck
63:45 and I was so swept away with the
63:47 propaganda of that particular day that I
63:49 completely at the time was a hundred
63:54 percent behind the guy a hundred percent
63:56 I had several employees on that day
63:59 several and I I would say I had a day of
64:05 poor judgment now that I look back and
64:07 in this very small circle my employees
64:10 probably about four of them I've voiced
64:14 such an opinion of what to do with these
64:16 people and one of my employees
64:20 contradicted me and challenged me and
64:23 said I don't think you know what you're
64:26 talking about and it wasn't that he was
64:29 aware of the of day's events by any
64:31 means he just simply saw through the
64:34 barbaric transformation of American
64:36 consciousness to retaliate almost
64:40 nonsensically and he said you don't know
64:42 who did this and you shouldn't run off
64:46 to hurt other people until you do know
64:47 who did this and I didn't call him the
64:52 bad word or anything but I likened him
64:53 to people that have been traitors to our
64:55 country and some years later I don't
64:59 know how many years later I would say
65:00 probably about ten years later I had the
65:04 fortunate opportunity to reconnect with
65:06 him through some online thing and I
65:09 apologized to him and it wasn't that he
65:12 had come around to the the true events
65:15 of that particular day but I said you
65:18 know you were right and I was wrong
65:20 I leaked a kind of cheap solution and
65:29 you kept your you kept your mind in
65:31 check so I complimented him on that and
65:34 so I feel much better about that
65:36 particular day for me the other day that
65:39 happened it is safe to say that that day
65:43 contained a tremendous amount of
65:45 mistakes in possibilities that were
65:48 caught on national television mistakes
65:51 that were actually brought up by anchors
65:53 who were covering that day 24/7
65:58 videos that were presented to the world
66:00 that were the gigantic glaring effect
66:03 problems that they had created that day
66:06 and we moved on because no one wants to
66:08 have those thoughts in our mind right
66:10 most of us are sick and tired of seeing
66:12 that day recalled on videos we don't
66:17 want to see the pictures of it anymore
66:18 we're tired of it a lot of you have
66:21 given up looking at it because say you
66:23 do know what happened that day and you
66:24 have decided to move on and that's
66:26 probably the best thing to do but it
66:29 would seem that the individuals who are
66:30 at a high level of authority there were
66:34 not a part of this day are having their
66:37 day today and they're having their day
66:40 every single day this year and a lot
66:44 last year and they're preparing but
66:48 let's let's recall a similar archetype
66:52 because it's something that I think that
66:54 we have to emulate how many times have
66:58 you seen the victim of a crime forgive
67:03 someone who has taken someone from them
67:07 someone who has removed a family member
67:09 perhaps greatly harmed them before they
67:14 took them out of this world
67:16 heinous things unforgivable things
67:19 and yet the family members who lost that
67:22 person you have to remember that day
67:24 every day that they wake up they wake up
67:26 into a nightmare of sorts they've had
67:30 their children removed their spouses
67:32 their fathers and their mothers they
67:36 find somehow the way to go into the room
67:40 with that individual have a discussion
67:42 and forgive them we don't necessarily
67:45 have to forgive but what these
67:47 individuals always say usually is that
67:51 nothing I can do to the other person who
67:54 did this to me
67:55 did this to my family member or friend
67:57 will ever bring back my family member or
68:00 my friend and they know that waking up
68:02 in a state of hatred is going to ruin
68:07 whatever days they have left in this
68:09 world the only thing they can do is can
68:12 you're living if there is an afterlife
68:14 then these individuals will see that
68:16 loved one again in some form or fashion
68:17 right all that was undone on that day
68:22 will never come back into existence the
68:25 way it was even if we built the
68:27 structures exactly the way they were
68:29 when they existed prior to that day
68:33 they'll never bring back the human souls
68:35 put them back in their bodies we can
68:40 only hope that a lot of the I'd say
68:43 recent events of last decade where they
68:45 forged these events and say that people
68:47 were removed from this world that
68:48 weren't we know that people were removed
68:52 from this world on that day we know for
68:54 a fact but let's just hope that a good
68:59 portion of those reported to have gone
69:01 were simply fabricated into existence in
69:03 the first place let's hope regardless
69:05 the day happened hundreds of people are
69:09 no longer here so what can we do about
69:12 it we can bring back critical thinking
69:16 we can bring back critical thinking as a
69:19 result of that day and use that acidic
69:22 moment in time to increase our critical
69:24 thinking or we can use fun things to
69:27 bring back critical thinking a large
69:30 portion of this shows intent is to do
69:32 just that to use positive things to
69:37 bring back critical thinking to increase
69:39 the lucidity that these days ever occur
69:42 again and they do occur again don't they
69:44 and small little events we find that
69:48 actors pretend to be witnesses pretend
69:51 to be victims we find rosters of people
69:56 that are supposedly removed from this
69:57 planet later appearing at other events
69:59 right in our frightened plain sight the
70:03 tip of the iceberg has been exposed as
70:06 of February 2018 the corruption the
70:11 power of the few the Grasshoppers we
70:15 need to realize that where the ants you
70:17 know we just need to rise up fight back
70:20 in a lot of cases there are are
70:23 alternatives to the tyranny that is
70:25 being imposed
70:26 you don't have to engage in certain
70:28 levels of physical inspection if you
70:30 don't want to if you feel so inclined I
70:34 would suggest that you take every
70:35 alternative you possibly can to avoid
70:38 that conditioning for your mind and to
70:40 pass it on to your fellow citizens in
70:44 some cases it might be fairly disruptive
70:46 in other cases it'll just pull you out
70:49 of the mix and you can go on with your
70:52 life a little bit more free as you might
70:55 have been before that day occurred right
70:57 there are events in history that are
70:59 taught to our children whether they be
71:01 accurate or false in which we say this
71:04 thing happened and we have to make sure
71:07 it never happens again there are dozens
71:10 and dozens of those things alive and
71:13 well today that are still occurring and
71:17 we need to do what we can in my opinion
71:21 to undo those things so that they stop
71:23 occurring and that the acceptance of
71:27 them being perpetrated on men are undone
71:30 our forefathers did a pretty good job in
71:33 America of figuring out some very
71:35 generic ways of saying these are the
71:38 rules by which we should live by derived
71:40 from again
71:41 documents out of Europe we have to
71:44 preserve those ideas we have to preserve
71:49 those ideas as they are enacted on us in
71:51 our society bar none because they were
71:56 they were developed over thousands of
71:58 years of suffering Magna Carta did not
72:01 come out of thin air it was at great
72:07 risk to those who drafted it in the
72:09 first place I'm sure people died trying
72:12 to get it enacted and I know that
72:16 millions of people have died protecting
72:18 it whether I mean you know forget all of
72:22 the the wars that shouldn't have been
72:25 fought the wars that have been fought to
72:27 preserve it and protect it and to
72:29 duplicated like software over here in
72:31 the United States we fought a very long
72:35 war in this country
72:38 protecting it today a war isn't all
72:42 fought with guns today a war is fought
72:46 with the mind you know this I have an
72:50 episode that is about life before this
72:53 day go look it up life was good before
72:57 this day that when we're talking about
73:00 it is possible to reset the world back
73:03 to the way it was prior to that day but
73:06 has been romanticized over and over
73:09 especially on television but the world
73:12 has changed and it can't be put back in
73:15 the bottle the only problem is we have
73:17 created a perpetual level of systemic
73:19 damage to a large part of the
73:22 consciousness of this planet due to that
73:23 day and here's what I want to propose we
73:28 talked about the millions of people who
73:30 no longer exist on this planet because
73:32 of the wars that followed up this day
73:35 rationalized by that day the thing that
73:39 keeps them alive is to say well we know
73:43 that day was conducted by individuals
73:46 that were corrupt if we don't tell the
73:49 other side that we know that and we
73:51 simply say don't be angry at us anymore
73:55 we're gonna go back to the way it was
73:57 that won't work because it does nothing
73:59 to repair the lives that we have
74:02 destroyed as a result of that day at a
74:05 minimum there are two things that we
74:06 have to do as the people who allowed our
74:10 organizations that govern us to conduct
74:13 such an event we have to acknowledge and
74:16 expose 100% in the public eye and the
74:20 mass eye that we do know that this was
74:25 not what it was said to be but the
74:29 individuals that have been accused of
74:30 that particular day and not the
74:32 individuals that really orchestrated it
74:34 in the official narrative we have to
74:38 publicly say the country by which the
74:41 identification is all routed back to is
74:43 now being accused of being a participant
74:47 in my research I don't have any proof of
74:50 that whatsoever
74:52 it was almost a patsy identification
74:55 source of the individuals that didn't
74:57 turn out to be from that country to
74:59 begin with because they're alive and
75:00 well in many cases right until i see
75:03 evidence to the contrary i think anyone
75:05 peddling that story is either
75:07 misinformed or they're part of the
75:09 disinformation that keeps that day from
75:13 being resolved i think that needs to
75:16 change but now how do you repair the
75:19 damage i think that the number one thing
75:23 that we can do to repair the mental
75:25 damage is to acknowledge it to those
75:27 that are suffering as a result of being
75:29 attacked
75:30 due to that day but we damaged way more
75:33 than their minds didn't we we damaged
75:35 their worlds we damaged their
75:36 communities the amount of bombed-out
75:38 cities in their region of the world is
75:43 almost too great to count those
75:47 facilities need to be replaced and
75:51 rebuilt under the guise that this was
75:54 wrong to destroy it in the first place
75:56 but at the entire time that we're doing
75:58 it we have to say we were not involved
76:01 with destruction of this this was a much
76:04 higher gain that was being played about
76:07 individuals that are now the hunted as
76:09 of 2018 so which is why we have to
76:12 preserve those who are hunting them
76:15 essentially we have to make amends and
76:17 we won't persuade large portions of
76:22 these individuals who have nothing else
76:23 to live for their economies are bad
76:27 their land is tough and hard they don't
76:30 like waking up in their region of the
76:33 world for many reasons which is why
76:34 they're friendly into countries that can
76:36 provide subsidies we allow the world to
76:39 be all unbalanced sort of as this prime
76:42 directive notion that we're not to
76:44 intervene in other countries but the
76:46 problem is we have intervened never the
76:49 show Star Trek after next generations
76:52 Gene Roddenberry introduced the prime
76:54 directive saying we're not to touch a
76:56 world until they've achieved warp speed
76:59 traveling at the speed of light once
77:00 they reach that they're now dabbling in
77:02 the galaxy and they must join
77:05 rest of us in the galaxy that can do the
77:06 same thing but what happens when they
77:09 accidentally pollute they get discovered
77:13 the mass gets pulled off the phasers are
77:17 discovered and the communicators are
77:19 discovered and their ships are
77:20 discovered in orbit what do we do in
77:22 that fictional show we do everything we
77:25 can to undo our knowledge or their
77:28 knowledge of us well we can't do that in
77:31 the real world can we the reality is is
77:34 that if we ever did that in real life as
77:37 portrayed in the Star Trek series there
77:40 would have to be some hastened
77:42 integration of that knowledge to say
77:44 well we do exist we mean you no harm
77:48 and when you achieve warp speed which
77:51 now you can make it your objective to do
77:52 so we will not give you technology to do
77:54 it you must learn it on your own we're
77:57 here with open arms and peace will
78:00 provide projection protection to you in
78:02 the meantime
78:03 so rest easy we won't participate in
78:06 your political events we won't tell you
78:08 what clothes to wear or how to behave
78:10 but we're here to help when the time
78:13 comes well for these countries and these
78:16 individuals that have been harmed as a
78:18 result of this day on behalf of us
78:20 through these corrupt factions that we
78:23 allow to occur right we now have to
78:27 intervene we now have to make amends
78:29 somehow it's going to be costly so
78:33 there's a mental element to it we have
78:35 to stop being so sure of ourselves we
78:39 have to take the Newcomb sign off of our
78:41 cars out of the inside of our brains and
78:44 you know I've talked to many soldiers
78:46 who've spent more than a decade over
78:48 there in firefights they've lost their
78:53 loved ones
78:53 their their buddies or their loved ones
78:56 and they have a different opinion
78:59 because they said these people are
79:01 really violent and they really fight and
79:04 they really have taken away invaluable
79:07 assets from my life being probably other
79:09 human beings more than anything we've
79:11 taken an arm they've taken a leg they've
79:13 taken eyesight hearing they've injected
79:17 PTSD in some of our
79:18 people but we have done all the same to
79:21 them tenfold haven't we the thing is is
79:24 we can't fight it out right we can't
79:28 fight more Wars to fix the problem and
79:32 for some people that's very frustrating
79:34 it's a less-is-more sort of thing now
79:37 the good news is is is that currently in
79:41 this month individuals are alive and
79:44 well or participating on all levels for
79:48 any of you who have been monitoring a
79:50 certain individual that's been posting
79:52 online very interesting cryptic messages
79:54 on a fairly weekly basis if this
79:58 individual has any merit in any
80:00 connection to what's really going on
80:02 which I believe this individual has
80:03 proven beyond a shadow of a doubt they
80:05 do have some connection a lot more is
80:08 happening to fix this problem then we
80:11 know about even those who think you
80:14 completely understand what he is saying
80:17 it's more our job as citizens I believe
80:22 is to pause the effects of that day to
80:27 the best of our ability it can be the
80:32 way that you get on a plane it can be
80:35 little surcharges in the bills that you
80:37 pay at your house that have been
80:38 injected as a result of that day for
80:41 some of you it's monitoring the politics
80:43 of the violations of our Constitution in
80:47 your respective countries as a result of
80:50 that day changing your mind about how
80:53 you perceive of this stuff is step
80:55 number one if you can effect change on
80:57 society that starts to remove these
81:01 layers of tyranny then that's your
81:02 second thing if you have children it's
81:05 good to raise them with the full
81:06 knowledge of what that day meant and
81:11 what it means to you when they're ready
81:13 right don't try to pull a four-year-old
81:15 and tell them all about how the world's
81:17 a spooky place they don't have the
81:19 faculties to understand that whenever
81:21 you determine they've got the the
81:24 ability to have an opinion to hold in
81:27 their mind one thought it gives any
81:30 dimension to what's
81:32 what is today's life you can start
81:34 explaining how we got here take time to
81:37 explain what it was like before that day
81:39 because that should be very powerful
81:41 they may not be able to conceive of a
81:44 world more free than that day but you
81:47 know your kids taken off their shoes and
81:49 watching mommy and daddy take off their
81:52 shoes and their belts and their jackets
81:54 and pulling every single piece of
81:55 equipment out of their luggage and
81:57 getting inspected it might be nice to
81:58 say you know kid before you were born it
82:02 wasn't like this when there was a day
82:05 where it all changed and we're trying to
82:08 get back to that day and whenever you
82:10 want to ask me a question about that
82:12 your old man's here to explain to your
82:14 mom's here to explain it to you now some
82:17 of you might be saying or thinking yeah
82:21 but there are people out there that will
82:23 continue trying to create these days to
82:26 put us back in the box that's why we
82:30 have to affect major change in our
82:33 governments and our institutions that
82:36 participate in supposedly trying to
82:38 prevent these days there are more good
82:41 people out there than bad people and
82:44 again there's so few people that are
82:47 willing to do this that if you took a
82:48 television and every pixel on your
82:50 television whether it be an 80 inch
82:52 television or whatever if you said every
82:55 pixel on this screen that is white are
82:59 the bad people and every pixel on the
83:01 screen that's not turned on it's black
83:02 by the good people I doubt you can see
83:07 the pixel of the dark people because
83:10 there are so few of them but when you
83:13 create a pyramid structure of control
83:15 over society all you need is the last
83:18 particle on the top of a eight mile high
83:21 pyramid to be corrupt before the whole
83:24 thing gets infected from the bottom up
83:26 what we call a systemic problem right so
83:29 it shouldn't be that hard to find a
83:31 single particle on the top of a
83:33 structure that points directly to that
83:36 particle right this isn't a needle in
83:39 the haystack necessarily you just keep
83:42 following up following up
83:46 it's not all about the money it's all
83:48 about the control when I tried to teach
83:53 people and when I do try to teach people
83:56 when they asked me you know will where
83:58 are these people where is the particle
84:00 and I just say just keep asking who runs
84:05 that organization and then who runs that
84:07 organization whether it be a banking
84:08 organization or government organization
84:10 or some other organization just keep
84:14 asking who runs it who runs that who
84:16 does that person report to who is that
84:18 person report to and when the org chart
84:20 tops out its the org chart that's above
84:23 that that's not written down anywhere
84:25 that has all the culprits you track
84:30 their money you track their lives
84:32 if anyone sealed their records to
84:34 conceal where they came from that's a
84:36 good sign I'm not talking about tax
84:39 returns who are they friends with who do
84:42 they mingle with doesn't mean a person
84:44 who shakes a hand with someone is
84:46 associated with that person photo-ops
84:49 happen all the time for people who are
84:50 powerful and good its the
84:54 decision-makers for those of you have
84:55 ever done sales before in your life
84:57 who do you want to talk to you to close
84:59 the deal you want to talk to the
85:01 decision-maker you don't give a crap how
85:03 powerful or how intense someone is in a
85:05 sub department if they don't make the
85:07 decision to purchase the product that
85:09 you're selling or the service that
85:10 you're selling it's really a matter of
85:13 lobbying that lower individual to have
85:16 the opinion that when asked by the
85:17 decision-maker should we buy this they
85:19 say yes I trust that person I like the
85:22 service and they go okay I'm factoring
85:24 that into my risk assessment as to
85:26 whether or not to buy the service of
85:27 this product well the control structure
85:30 is that on top of us are exactly the
85:31 same I think you feel me should be a lot
85:35 of comments from you guys there really
85:37 should be so I anticipate that I'm
85:42 anxious as of this month the censorship
85:46 is is getting pretty thorough
85:51 I was notified this morning that a
85:56 artery of truth out there recently
86:00 received notice that incriminating
86:03 evidence against some recent events that
86:08 was posted on a social media website
86:11 let's just leave it there was actually
86:14 removed or forcibly removed before that
86:18 artery was allowed to be viewed by
86:20 anyone else I want to leave you with one
86:23 last thing I want you to repeat over and
86:25 over and over again to your family
86:28 members to your feeds anywhere you have
86:31 a feed don't you know don't injure your
86:33 job or anything don't go on LinkedIn and
86:35 start posting crap anywhere you have
86:38 either anonymity or a group of people
86:41 you trust or just an average
86:44 conversation with someone else in this
86:46 world in most modern countries if
86:48 there's a crime committed and a person
86:52 has has knowledge of the crime and
86:55 obstructs justice by concealing the
86:59 evidence of the crime in any way shape
87:02 it can be construed in a court of law
87:04 you didn't tell a police officer you
87:06 didn't tell someone and again I know
87:08 that there are circumstances where you
87:10 can't trust certain law enforcement but
87:12 I think that's a very small case at this
87:16 point we don't need to necessarily
87:21 contact law enforcement about things
87:23 when you contact each other about these
87:25 things create the viral awakening that
87:27 we keep talking about right with those
87:30 that aid in two-bed criminals get
87:33 similar charges that the criminals get
87:36 the criminals typically get the higher
87:39 incarceration timeframes right I had an
87:45 acquaintance that was not a friend of
87:49 mine but an acquaintance that it was
87:50 introduced to me once it was a female as
87:52 a matter of fact she was in the back of
87:54 a car when some guys that she were she
87:59 was hanging out with went inside and
88:01 robbed a bank
88:03 they came back into the car this is this
88:06 is according to her story of course I
88:07 don't think she'd had the balls to go
88:09 inside but she said she stayed in the
88:11 car didn't know what was going on
88:12 whatever
88:13 the gentleman that did the crime
88:15 received twenty to thirty years one guy
88:18 got twenty one guy that got twenty seven
88:21 but the girl in the back of the car got
88:23 nine years nine years in prison she
88:30 didn't
88:31 as far as that well they didn't get away
88:32 with anything for one thing she hadn't
88:33 done it before as far as I know she got
88:37 nine years so any employee or owner or
88:42 board of directors that infringed on two
88:46 things if you have a country that
88:49 protects freedom of speech then that's
88:53 the first violation and that should be
88:54 probably one of the most paramount
88:56 violations of the country you live in
88:59 again if I were to rent a property to
89:01 you I cannot say that you can't have
89:04 this property because you're a certain
89:05 race or you're certain gender they're
89:07 organizations that protect you against
89:09 someone behaving like that
89:11 same thing goes for the First Amendment
89:15 but when we post incriminating evidence
89:18 somewhere inside someone else's
89:21 corporation that is governed by a
89:24 constitution that that corporation is
89:26 benefiting from in its existence right
89:29 they are aiding and abetting the crime
89:32 that they are censoring against
89:34 currently because it's not happened
89:37 before in America I can't speak for
89:39 other countries or sort of taken off
89:41 guard and we're not going the full legal
89:44 route that we should be going to go
89:46 after these corporations and say well
89:48 you have two choices either go out of
89:52 business immediately shutting down your
89:55 company and liquidating all of your
89:56 assets or you have to allow freedom of
90:00 speech all right now there is one
90:03 freedom of speech that is illegal in the
90:05 United States of America and it's a very
90:07 different thing and we call it hate
90:09 speech in America
90:11 let's need speech in other countries as
90:13 well but like I said there's something
90:15 called assault someone threatening
90:19 someone else's safety someone saying
90:21 something that can be easily construed
90:23 as doing harm to the other person that
90:27 is illegal and that is something that
90:30 can be censored because it is a crime it
90:34 is assault that has been captured in
90:35 social media postings someone who
90:38 threatens the safety or well-being of
90:40 another person do damage or to kill that
90:44 can be removed and that's what we should
90:45 do and then we should obviously go to
90:48 the individual who's making those
90:49 threats and press full charges to
90:52 correct their mental state and if they
90:54 are unwilling to comply then they can be
90:56 incarcerated if they are insane they can
90:59 be put in a hospital maybe rehabilitated
91:01 but nothing else taken out of the cycle
91:04 of population right so we don't have any
91:06 more of this
91:07 the only uniqueness in this would be to
91:10 say if you believe someone to be a
91:12 criminal and you say if they are
91:15 criminal I hope that they are
91:17 apprehended by the law
91:19 that's not assault that is your opinion
91:21 that they should that was your opinion
91:23 that they're guilty and it's your
91:24 opinion that they should suffer the
91:27 normal judicious judicial system in some
91:30 cases without a jury because they have
91:32 great you know they have committed high
91:34 treason but if an event occurs and
91:39 commercial profit organizations are not
91:43 covering the facts of the day and you
91:46 believe you have uncovered evidence that
91:48 is contrary to what they're saying or
91:52 offers a different story of what
91:55 happened because it's not being covered
91:56 at all no alternative narrative is being
91:59 discussed and you believe you have proof
92:01 you are 100% within your rights to
92:05 publish those results if you well I
92:10 should say this in the meantime until we
92:12 gain consciousness and a law firm has
92:14 the balls to go after these people
92:16 someone has the money to pay the law
92:18 firm the law firm itself says you know
92:20 what if this continues we'll be out of a
92:23 lot of the work that we
92:25 and so in order to defend our own
92:28 self-preservation we need to step in and
92:31 probably smack these guys down hopefully
92:34 both will occur you can get your own
92:36 domain in your own website use WordPress
92:39 and start publishing what you want on
92:41 your site don't commit assaults just
92:46 report the facts as you know be
92:49 objective but if it gets censored there
92:52 is no there's no out and saying that
92:57 well I was told to break the law
93:01 therefore I broke the law so an employee
93:03 engaging in censorship at a lower level
93:05 has no immunity whatsoever in committing
93:09 a crime which in this country is
93:12 violating the First Amendment so I would
93:15 say the censorship that's going on today
93:17 in some cases is illegal and punishable
93:21 by whatever would be the punishment for
93:26 violating the Constitution of the United
93:28 States which as far as I'm informed is
93:32 some of the highest crimes you can
93:34 commit in this country equal to murder
93:38 okay
93:39 I think you feel me if you have minute
93:43 deep thoughts radio Calm please go

93:47 lakh Facebook group there is patreon for
