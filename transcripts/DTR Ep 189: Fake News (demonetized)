00:28 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:30 deep thoughts today we are going to talk
00:34 about fake news and I'm almost tempted
00:38 to call it real news and reverse the
00:40 whole thing and try to be clever but we
00:43 want people who are interested in fake
00:45 news angles and perception to find the
00:48 keywords so we'll keep it fake news
00:50 here's what we're gonna do on this
00:52 episode and here's what we're not going
00:53 to do in this episode firstly what we're
00:58 not going to do is really focus on any
01:00 specific events in history where we know
01:04 it was fake news I will talk about a few
01:07 events that are more indicative of the
01:10 species of how fake news is processed
01:15 but we'll wrote what we're gonna do is
01:17 look at what news is the value of news
01:23 in your life in your circle of life why
01:27 you watch it in the first place what are
01:29 the desires and gains that you have in
01:32 engaging in such a thing and then we're
01:35 going to look at institutions that
01:37 started off good but once a profit
01:42 margin was introduced into the mechanism
01:44 of news they lost their minds the
01:49 corporation's lost their minds and the
01:52 individuals that work inside the
01:53 corporations lost their minds to money
01:55 and greed some it was quite direct and
01:59 some of it I think virtually all of it
02:01 today is very indirect fake news it's a
02:07 big concern right we know their [ __ ]
02:08 tons of it all over the world now it's
02:12 really tough to honestly refer an
02:15 article to a friend or to some Facebook
02:17 page or to speak about it in some
02:19 YouTube channel because my god you know
02:23 you're not there that's really the the
02:26 crux of it you're not there so you can't
02:29 confirm anything and what's interesting
02:32 about that is that you have friends that
02:35 you don't quite
02:36 either and all they're doing is telling
02:38 you what happened at their house on
02:41 Saturday night between the time of 7:00
02:43 and midnight let's dial back news news
02:49 is interesting what's the news
02:51 right that's how you ask it in a
02:53 paradigm what's interesting about
02:55 quote-unquote news is that it feels a
02:58 little bit different than someone
02:59 telling you in your personal life what
03:01 happened around the corner there was an
03:04 old you know catchphrase or axiom you
03:07 know that was like what's the news man
03:10 what's the good news and you would greet
03:12 each other like this in the 70s and then
03:15 it kind of went away and it was sort of
03:17 interesting at some point there was an
03:20 abstract between or I should say a
03:22 divide between a human being telling you
03:25 what happened and someone on television
03:27 telling you what happened the
03:28 credibility was on TV and your friend
03:32 was to be questioned or not believed or
03:34 yeah whatever at least that's how I've
03:36 experienced it now the richest
03:41 information I get today consequently is
03:43 from the human being and first up from
03:46 someone who I believe has a an
03:48 incredible level of perception on
03:50 reality they are consistently correct in
03:54 their observations as it relates to what
03:57 I see with my own eyes but what did man
04:01 do before the news to begin with because
04:03 it's very important to understand that
04:04 before we put any value on truth in news
04:08 as well as fake news well early man
04:13 didn't really have any concept for a
04:15 plane of existence cities way way over
04:18 there and then they had their city here
04:20 right the very first tribes that existed
04:23 got comfortable in a jungle got
04:25 comfortable in a lush desert you know
04:28 with like palm trees in one area and
04:29 desert in the other area but wherever we
04:32 settled our first incarnation is homo
04:37 sapien we only knew where we were and
04:41 you got to remember that because that is
04:42 the first lesson in the you know
04:46 perception of reality / news 101
04:49 you had the halo of your of your
04:51 eyeballs as far as you could see and as
04:54 far as your brain was capable of
04:56 conceiving of objects and events and
04:58 timelines quote-unquote in your eyesight
05:02 your frustum were you able to perceive
05:05 anything it's so important that you
05:08 remember that the reason why I say that
05:10 is that you might be returning right
05:12 back to that so we got to know where we
05:15 started because you might end up coming
05:16 back to something like that the future
05:18 right okay at some point tribes gained
05:22 enough population gain enough real
05:25 estate that they then start setting up
05:27 in different areas and think about you
05:30 got a tribe that actually reaches out
05:32 and creates a city next door so they
05:35 know they've created a sister city next
05:37 door there's another waterhole over
05:39 there there's more fruit over there and
05:41 how they kind of have a caravan a trade
05:43 Caravan that goes back and forth between
05:45 the two cities hey we got a little more
05:48 fruit this year well we got a hell of a
05:49 lot of water and so they trade back and
05:52 forth but imagine the first city that
05:55 didn't expand it maybe got big but it
05:59 didn't expand and somehow someone walks
06:02 out of the forest dressed a little
06:04 different looks a little different maybe
06:06 they have a spear maybe have nothing
06:08 neither bone in the nose whatever and
06:11 the other people looking at him like oh
06:13 my god you just materialized that I'm
06:15 nothing and of course there's this
06:18 disorientation to perceive that there's
06:20 actually a world outside of your world
06:23 fast-forward a little bit and they
06:25 figured out a way to communicate either
06:28 with hand gestures etc perhaps even a
06:33 seedling of their past was responsible
06:35 for this other tribe going out so their
06:37 languages are very similar but they you
06:38 know at some point they learn how to
06:39 communicate with each other and you have
06:42 for the very first time a real sense of
06:47 information that came from a for a far
06:49 away place to you predicted what was
06:52 there said you know basically I
06:54 predicted but describe what was there
06:57 they bundle up a bunch of supplies and
07:00 they go to the other location and
07:01 they're welcomed at the other location
07:03 and wow this person brought news of
07:06 their village far away of their group
07:10 far away and let's just had a little bit
07:14 of romance to it because it puts in a
07:16 spin a purpose and value to news one guy
07:24 goes to the other side trucks across and
07:27 my god he finds the most beautiful
07:29 female he has ever seen in his life and
07:31 she agrees he is the most handsome male
07:35 and they get married they have tons of
07:38 children and life is good and his entire
07:42 life and her entire life and even their
07:45 kids they go on and on about how
07:50 important it was that someone brought
07:52 them news that this other place existed
07:55 now let's introduce a little variable
07:57 here for several centuries people go
08:04 back and forth and because they are
08:06 good-hearted they don't war they discuss
08:09 what they see in different locations
08:12 they go out and Scout waterholes and
08:14 they work with their local politicians
08:16 and chieftains to figure out how to
08:18 distribute things evenly and life is
08:21 good and then perhaps one of the groups
08:27 breeds this devilish gene pool known as
08:32 greed and they find a massive waterhole
08:35 and I mean a good one and the waterhole
08:38 attracts livestock of all kinds so the
08:41 hunting is good the water is big enough
08:43 that fish exist and plenty the water
08:47 isn't salty like the ocean so it could
08:49 be drink immediately and someone says
08:54 man this is good but that village that
08:57 tribe that discovers this great pool of
09:00 resources is not as big as the other
09:02 tribes and they kind of feel intimidated
09:05 maybe they're short in stature but they
09:09 realized that once they gain all these
09:10 resources something changes
09:13 there people are so weak all the time
09:16 like North Korean soldiers right they
09:20 eat all the time over a couple
09:24 generations man the kids start getting
09:25 bigger and with nourished mind comes a
09:31 higher intelligence perhaps just
09:36 pretending to scrounge and have those
09:38 resources at their beck and call they
09:40 end up selling tons of fish tons of
09:43 livestock they always have fresh water
09:45 and so their banks fill up with money
09:47 they go from being cellular one to being
09:51 Verizon from the bottom to the top but
09:55 the rule that the tribes actually agreed
09:58 upon was that once something is
09:59 discovered its shared among all of the
10:02 people because the more fortunate tribes
10:06 perhaps have facilitated the growth of
10:09 this teeny tiny tribe that may have
10:11 started out you know a dozen como
10:15 sapiens and and they turned into two
10:16 dozen and three dozen but when they
10:18 discovered this great resource it became
10:20 thousands the other tribes get
10:23 suspicious and they come to the the new
10:26 budding tribe and they say have you
10:28 found a new way to make do with what you
10:32 have or have you found something
10:35 just recently that's allowed you to
10:39 expand the way that we see you expanding
10:41 I mean look at you guys you have
10:43 everything and the chieftain has
10:46 convinced his tribe to lie given them
10:53 some
10:55 rah-rah story about the preservation of
10:58 their kind perhaps they're all the same
11:01 species but for whatever reason they
11:03 they're the red makeup people they're
11:05 the red clay people all the other tribes
11:08 are some other color and so they all lie
11:12 now the chain of news the chain of truth
11:15 the chain of perception chain of reality
11:18 and all the above has been injured why
11:22 would anyone lie in that village because
11:27 there's technically profit in it
11:29 there's gain in it they visit the other
11:34 villages after they put on their poor
11:37 man's clothes they visit the other
11:38 villages and they realize how much that
11:40 people are struggling to eat to have
11:43 clean water to have any form of currency
11:46 to buy things and they think they're
11:49 lucky stars every day they go home and
11:51 for the first generation that works are
11:53 very hard to harvest and capture
11:56 everything at that new resource and they
11:59 could say well I toiled to make all this
12:02 up and I killed all those animals I work
12:04 ten hours while the other village
12:05 workers only work four so I earned it
12:09 but as that population grows and
12:12 offspring are created the offspring
12:15 don't have to work as hard as their
12:16 parents because the blen their parents
12:18 have amassed a lot of wealth to begin
12:19 with they could pay someone else to do
12:21 the job for them but there are more
12:23 people so there's less there's less work
12:26 per individual they don't have to work
12:27 so hard and then it turns into what we
12:30 have today which is individuals that say
12:33 while I was blessed to be given this
12:34 wealth and now I wake up in constant
12:37 fear of being taken away from me how
12:40 does this apply to news I think there's
12:44 a direct correlation news was expected
12:48 to be a hundred percent truth when it
12:54 first started and who God knows when it
12:56 first started we don't really know
12:59 probably tablets made of stone made of
13:03 mud advanced to some sort of paper
13:08 obviously the printing breasts came
13:10 around changed everything and now of
13:13 course electronic medium has created
13:17 television has created the internet etc
13:19 etc you all know the game now there have
13:23 been so many acidic weird formulas
13:25 attached to news it's going to take me a
13:27 little while to get to each and every
13:28 nook and cranny of it all right but the
13:31 first one is the perception that we wake
13:34 up insecure about our perception of
13:36 reality we're insecure we wake up and
13:40 it's not just enough information to know
13:41 what's in your bedroom what's in your
13:43 bathroom which in your front room how
13:44 your kids are how your spouse is doing
13:47 well that's your car got ripped off in
13:48 the middle of the night it's not enough
13:50 for some reason do you need more and the
13:56 only reason why you think you need more
13:58 it's because someone has told you a tale
14:04 about another far-off land or another
14:06 far-off place that's important to you
14:11 and so you feel like you have to dial in
14:15 to the world because you no longer see
14:18 yourself as a human being in a home you
14:20 see yourself as a tic-tac on the surface
14:24 of a giant globe at least some of you do
14:28 and you see yourself as this Savior of
14:33 reality you need to know what's going on
14:37 in Indonesia and Pakistan and Russia and
14:41 Ukraine you have to know what's going on
14:44 at the EU in Africa and South America
14:46 you have to know even though you have no
14:49 vocational ability to impact those zones
14:52 in the world you don't know anyone in
14:53 those regions you have no money to
14:55 donate you have no time to donate you
14:58 don't understand the geopolitical
14:59 relationships between countries
15:02 you feel like you got a no because
15:05 knowing where the [ __ ] you are ain't
15:06 enough when it probably is now I'm not
15:12 sure if newspapers I'm sure this is the
15:16 case but I'm not sure when especially
15:19 but the idea of getting a news
15:22 paper something printed without some
15:25 sort of advertising in it that must be a
15:28 long time ago right
15:31 what were their first incarnations of
15:34 news and what is the difference between
15:37 news and knowledge well it's an
15:42 interesting conceptual distinction right
15:44 if I if you don't know the Greek and you
15:48 know it's back that's a 100 AD 100 BCE
15:51 excuse me and here the Greek have have
15:54 plagiarized the living [ __ ] out of the
15:57 Egyptians but they've taken it further
15:59 they've earned some alkyl aids because
16:01 they've taken it further they've been
16:02 able to describe it in a way that most
16:04 of Europe can understand it and here
16:06 comes a book and is teaching you
16:09 Pythagoras theorem teaching you some
16:11 geometry in one way that is news to your
16:15 mind about how to do that that this is
16:17 even something that you can calculate
16:18 and it's news of how you could use that
16:21 methodology to improve your construction
16:23 capabilities or design capabilities or
16:26 just think clearly but there comes a
16:29 point in time when you know all of the
16:31 things that you really want to know that
16:32 is your core critical mass to operate in
16:35 life you're able to make a living you're
16:37 able to protect your children and then
16:40 the thing that comes left the thing that
16:42 is left excuse me is current affairs
16:48 what's going on how did we get addicted
16:52 to current affairs in my mind the only
16:57 way that current affairs budded was when
17:01 the unexpected happened to a particular
17:03 society taxes were raised raiders came
17:08 in and pillaged perhaps they didn't take
17:11 over the city but they really damaged
17:13 the city
17:15 and I'm sure the aristocratic
17:19 allegorical monarchical layers needed it
17:25 you know figured out first way and we
17:26 should probably get some word from that
17:28 city over there whether or not anyone
17:30 dislikes us or that country over there
17:33 and then they were able to protect them
17:35 selves right now we'll say in history
17:39 there's a very interesting thing that's
17:41 happened in history happened with the
17:43 Native Americans quite a bit as per
17:45 their own emissions if you were to try
17:48 to send someone to the city next door
17:50 and their job is to figure out what the
17:54 sentiment is towards your city to figure
17:56 out whether or not there's any plans to
17:58 take you over or bottle you or do
18:00 whatever and you ask the question in the
18:04 wrong manner you will create perhaps a
18:09 lie what do I mean by that well the way
18:14 to really get the information is to not
18:17 allow the city that you're going to to
18:20 know that you're there to get the
18:21 information about your city you merely
18:24 live there you mingle you have normal
18:26 conversations about everything the price
18:29 of bread how life is going how the
18:32 weather is
18:33 you never ever say anything about what
18:36 you're trying to extrapolate out because
18:39 the second you do you insert the
18:43 question Oh what do you mean what do I
18:47 think of the other city what do you
18:49 think of the other city what do you
18:50 think in that place I never really
18:52 thought about it should I have an
18:54 opinion yeah I don't know maybe and then
18:57 the person has to make an opinion the
18:59 suspicions there and someone goes well
19:02 if I really have to think about it
19:04 yeah maybe I don't like them you know I
19:06 never thought about before someone asked
19:08 me the question I didn't care
19:10 see how subtle that is someone might
19:14 find out that you're a paid informant of
19:17 what's going on and if they don't kill
19:20 you they feed you [ __ ]
19:23 well they say well you know for a price
19:26 I'll I'll get you have ten opinions I'll
19:29 get you the opinion of that guy over
19:30 there
19:31 okay here's your gold I think I can feed
19:35 him crap the first film I wrote was
19:39 about Native Americans and it's kind of
19:41 the old history and I hate a Native
19:45 American element in it and I started
19:47 getting the old books written in the
19:49 late 1800s Early 1900s and a lot of
19:53 historians were saying look you know we
19:54 thought we were getting really good
19:56 information on the Native Americans but
19:57 when they started getting compensated
19:59 for their knowledge about their race one
20:04 they didn't went to all the white men
20:05 anything so they weren't getting
20:06 anything then they get started getting
20:08 paid for it and they thought well
20:11 someone probably told them the truth but
20:13 a lot of folks said tell them lies and
20:15 take their money and because we had you
20:18 know obviously strangled them into
20:20 ridiculous reservations when it was
20:22 their land to begin with
20:23 they took any money they could get or
20:26 products or whatever and so this moment
20:31 when a straight line of total truth and
20:34 news starts to fray is super
20:38 multi-dimensional and that is just an
20:40 organic fray of truth an organic
20:44 corruption there's a principle of
20:47 mankind called the haves and the
20:48 have-nots it is probably the most acidic
20:54 corrupt thought that any human being can
20:57 have it does exist in many forms and in
21:03 the way of injustice for sure but what's
21:09 interesting is is that when you travel
21:12 the world when you see these other you
21:15 know communities in the world you see
21:18 people without anything and they don't
21:21 know it and they love their lives
21:23 there's been several documentaries on
21:26 Netflix where some documentary filmmaker
21:29 will go to the most remote village of
21:31 the Philippines most remote village of
21:33 Argentina Brazil out in the forest you
21:37 know and there's some of the most kind
21:40 wonderful happy people they just they're
21:43 packed with smiles the whole time Africa
21:46 pack with smiles I'm sure they had their
21:50 disputes and what-have-you no war from
21:52 time to time
21:54 but overall they're pretty good but once
21:59 you teach them that they're missing out
22:02 you infect their mind that what they
22:07 have which is plentiful or I should say
22:09 is enough to sustain them every single
22:11 day without any pain
22:12 got any disproportionate hunger yeah
22:15 plenty shelter they can dominate the
22:18 Predators in their area there's plenty
22:22 of males and females and the ratio it's
22:26 good but reporting what happens around
22:30 the world to an individual area starts
22:33 to get into this corruption of thought
22:35 how do you watch a sort of documentary
22:40 special on Monaco and you live anywhere
22:44 else on planet earth and you don't see
22:46 the craziness of money being spent in
22:49 that little country I am unaware of a
22:54 country that spends more money and has
22:56 more money than that little retreat for
22:58 the elite ensure there's a Rothschild
23:00 mansion here and no sex goes Berg you
23:04 know castle over there not a whole city
23:10 right so part of this news element can
23:15 be related to your overall inspirational
23:17 arc of gosh look at those famous people
23:21 in Hollywood you know all those stories
23:22 of actresses and actors in the 40s 50s
23:25 who migrated to Hollywood even 30s and
23:29 20s to because of the tale of what was
23:33 there and thank God some of them did
23:35 because we got some incredible actors
23:37 because of it
23:38 right so there's a positive element to
23:41 it for sure
23:43 but once you can lure mankind to
23:46 anything that isn't real or the real has
23:53 a quantity and so you can take the
23:56 overflow and trick them you got an issue
24:01 you got a problem on your hands as it
24:05 applies to news well
24:07 you have some information that people
24:09 want to know perhaps as a sports score
24:12 something incidental something
24:14 entertaining and once you have them you
24:18 can do all kinds of things with them
24:20 force them to watch advertising force
24:24 them to read about articles that are
24:26 anything but healthy for their mind
24:29 there's an analogy and give you about
24:32 Los Angeles at any one time in Los
24:35 Angeles there are 1 million actors
24:37 looking for work and that's a very
24:40 specific number now there's only you
24:43 know on any one given day there's about
24:45 a thousand to ten thousand jobs
24:47 available and a lot of those are closed
24:49 auditions where you can't get in unless
24:50 you have an agent and a career so once
24:53 you start dividing the number of jobs
24:54 available by 1 million you start getting
24:57 the percentage of your chance of getting
24:59 a role and so there's a lot of
25:03 predatorial companies that try to sell
25:06 the fantasy of succeeding to people that
25:09 have obviously no talent that don't have
25:13 a grasp of what's going on they've been
25:14 they're unwilling to go to acting school
25:16 writing school or anything right they
25:18 just feel entitled to win just like
25:20 those tone-deaf folks that go on
25:22 American Idol back in the day so a lot
25:27 of these folks get lured into kind of
25:30 peripheral jobs that aren't good for
25:33 them the porn industry promises these
25:37 girls if you just have one video under
25:39 addition to my buddy and then he you
25:41 know he produced this movie and the guys
25:43 just like on the absolute fringe of
25:44 doing anything incredible but when
25:49 you're looking at going back home with
25:50 your tail between your legs or trying
25:53 that's how they're getting a lot of
25:54 these people into these horrible things
25:57 photoshoots they shouldn't do getting
26:00 hooked on drugs just that's simple
26:03 get them hooked on drugs to ease the
26:05 pain of losing but to get them to do
26:08 things they shouldn't do and it does
26:10 produce a little bit of cash form right
26:12 so in the news can lure you in the
26:15 reason why I mentioned this analogy when
26:16 the news can lure you in for one thing
26:18 but sell you a bunch of other stuff
26:20 it's sort of that algorithm and that
26:23 other stuff is starts to reveal I should
26:27 say their agendas so let's get into fake
26:32 news what do we mean by fake news hmm it
26:39 was different different species nowadays
26:40 write fake news from all the right left
26:45 paradigm brands were really news that
26:50 was sent from sort of those who control
26:56 any one particular country you know
26:59 Eisenhower warned us about the military
27:01 industrial complex because it was taking
27:05 over the way that America was run and
27:08 then there's a lot of three-letter
27:10 acronym agencies that do the actual
27:13 dirty work or actually brainstorm the
27:16 more sophisticated agendas and it used
27:20 to be perceived back in the day as
27:22 dominance of America over other
27:24 countries and so we go we wrote blank
27:26 checks to all of these covert secret
27:29 societies that Kennedy talked about
27:32 because we thought well it's for the
27:34 greater good of America you know screw
27:36 those commies those chinks those Japs is
27:39 whatever's right and then we realized we
27:42 had been had the agenda was to create a
27:46 pyramid structure within the country
27:49 such that there was going to be a very
27:51 small group of folks at the top that
27:53 were all European and I say that
27:56 regardless if they live in America and
27:58 were born in America they see themselves
27:59 as citizens of Europe and they always
28:03 will see themselves as citizens of
28:05 Europe they do not actually have a
28:06 molecule in their body of American pride
28:11 they have family you know blue bloodline
28:14 Brighton and America went from a dream
28:17 of an actual destination with sovereign
28:20 rights and alienable rights as the
28:22 Republic dictates and the Constitution
28:24 enforces to a business with a dun and
28:30 bradstreet listing right every single
28:33 country
28:34 I'm sorry every single state city town
28:36 province whatever in America has a
28:40 corporation attached to it and that's
28:43 because it's turned into a corporation
28:46 there's people at the top making all the
28:48 money and all of us slaved down below
28:52 and the system is designed to ensure
28:55 that we are not capable of ever rising
29:00 to their level
29:01 not through intelligence and especially
29:03 not through financing and slowly over
29:06 time you guys know that once leaders
29:09 rose up outside of the paradigm of
29:11 political control
29:13 they were co-opted you know Martin
29:18 Luther King was co-opted and then
29:20 murdered Malcolm X was co-opted and
29:22 murdered before Martin Luther King bad
29:27 substitutes were put in for those two
29:29 men you know the white folk in America
29:32 well we're willing to worship
29:33 politicians and celebrities so where
29:37 were easy to control we didn't even we
29:40 didn't perceive the need to have an
29:41 outside leader of any kind because we're
29:45 so stuck in yesterday paradigms right
29:49 sadly one of the yesterday paradigms has
29:51 to do with trusting human beings but
29:54 news in America because I don't know
29:56 anything about the news in other
29:57 locations really took off when it got to
30:02 the printing press right newspapers and
30:05 there was something called journalism
30:07 and journalism was this checks and
30:10 balances where several individuals would
30:12 check a claim it was a one person one
30:16 person was never capable of saying this
30:18 is true and it got printed you had to
30:21 have multiple sources multiple
30:24 eyewitnesses and then it started to
30:28 affect the way that businesses could run
30:34 Standard Oil Company I forgot the the
30:36 woman's name but Santa Doyle company was
30:38 taken down by a woman in the 1890s who
30:42 said this is a complete monopoly this
30:44 has got to be broken up
30:47 and she was a victor but she wouldn't
30:51 looked at it and once they realized the
30:54 power of an individual which was
30:55 something that they they had realized
30:57 this back in the Greek Theatre days
30:58 right when Greek theater writers used to
31:01 use their plays to influence the people
31:03 against the politicians then the
31:06 politicians would have the army kill the
31:08 actors kill the writers you know that's
31:12 what TMZ is right now you know TMZ and
31:14 all the paparazzi inquiry or Enquirer
31:17 magazine star magazines they're all
31:19 there to make sure that when celebrities
31:20 gain the power to talk to the people
31:23 that they are marginalized beyond
31:26 measure and now we're inside something
31:29 I'm going to talk about a little later
31:30 which is called pre censorship that rod
31:33 serling the inventor of Twilight Zone
31:35 told us about let's go back to the
31:36 newspaper so gentlemen I believe his
31:40 name is William Randolph Hearst and he
31:43 is known for being the first unequivocal
31:47 lying newspaper printer they categorized
31:52 his form of journalism as yellow
31:54 journalism because what ended up
31:56 happening was as they realized that
31:58 whatever they printed a newspaper the
32:01 settlers of America would read it and
32:03 believe it and then spread it and it
32:07 went on for decades and decades and
32:09 decades like this we didn't they spread
32:13 it then someone wrote a lie on accident
32:18 and it's spread and he create a little
32:21 bit of chaos then they realized oh my
32:24 god that was just something we had to
32:25 retract off the front page because we
32:27 thought it went one way but it actually
32:29 went the other way and they realized
32:32 well that's an interesting phenomenon
32:34 you mean when we print anything people
32:38 believe it and it creates hysteria or
32:41 creates calmness there's the Hearst
32:47 Castle Castle down by the coast in
32:50 California out there in Monterey and
32:52 people go there and they pay money to
32:54 walk around his castle you were walking
32:56 around a castle that was paid for by
32:59 fake news
33:01 you're celebrating and financing the
33:03 furthering of the idol-worshipping of
33:06 the first mogul of fake news not
33:11 unbelievable Orson Welles ended up
33:14 hating the Hearst family they're doing
33:18 what they did there's a lot of
33:20 speculation that they played a role in
33:22 destroying his career eventually but he
33:24 was a definitely a care a contained
33:27 giris person to get along with if you
33:29 disagreed with him but he was a genius
33:32 but yellow journalism played a huge role
33:35 in the establishment of the 16th
33:38 amendment in the United States of
33:40 America which for us is the formation of
33:42 the Federal Reserve and the
33:44 formalization of taxing the citizens in
33:48 a way that is unconstitutional although
33:50 in their tax code for legal reasons it
33:52 says voluntary right it didn't get
33:55 ratified which means passed in enough
33:57 states to be actually turned on but
34:00 while senators are being held at
34:03 gunpoint in their respective states and
34:06 some respective caucuses to sign this
34:09 thing one there was no journalism on
34:12 that event even though they protested in
34:14 the streets later and saying we we
34:16 didn't vote for this we were held at
34:18 gunpoint
34:18 Hearst got on the back of a train with
34:23 Taft and with Woodrow Wilson and went
34:26 all around the United States and a
34:28 caboose PR blitz telling everyone that
34:31 the 16th amendment was ratified and
34:34 everybody I guess was happy I don't know
34:36 because it was a Robin Hood formula 16th
34:40 members promised to tax corporations and
34:42 rich people but they had already written
34:44 the tax code to make sure that they
34:45 weren't going to get taxed they had
34:48 corporate shelters plenty of loopholes
34:50 my god the loopholes in 1913 were the
34:53 size of you know a black hole the people
34:57 got socked in the past right away but
35:01 William Randolph Hearst what he did was
35:03 he had a you know some money his father
35:05 was a yo C Deadwood the series his
35:07 father was actually a silver and gold
35:09 miner so he gave his son tons of cash
35:12 they bought some big papers
35:14 some big papers but what ended up
35:15 happening by 1913 he had an empire of
35:19 newspapers he went in every small town
35:21 he controlled the majority as I
35:24 understand it the majority of United
35:27 States newspapers and so if you wanted
35:30 to get anything to happen you had to pay
35:32 off Hearst
35:33 like on the side you had to pay him off
35:36 now meanwhile he's selling newspapers
35:38 and he's selling advertising in the back
35:40 of newspapers in addition to help pay
35:43 the bills right it was an opportunity
35:45 right in a way an advertisement is news
35:50 right well I didn't know they had this
35:51 new product my gosh I mean I can buy
35:53 this elixir and I grow hair on my face
35:56 but that is the definitive moment in
35:58 American history where the news was
36:02 probably permanently corrupted because
36:06 the richest people in the world had just
36:08 taken over America through a coup de
36:10 Gras absolutely destroyed us and so that
36:15 was the name of the game but they had
36:19 this problem they still had this
36:20 resisting force called journalism and
36:23 journalists and this went on according
36:27 to an interview with Rod Serling in 1959
36:30 which you need to just look up Rod
36:31 Serling interview there's only one on
36:34 YouTube it persisted as a problem until
36:40 the mid 50s and by the mid 50s
36:42 you had television evolving to replace
36:45 newspapers
36:47 although newspapers were always
36:49 perceived as the way you get the
36:51 in-depth story of what's going on but
36:53 when you know the network started in
36:55 America what you have to understand is
36:56 it was like community service television
36:58 there was a camera downtown and people
37:00 went and stood in front of it and
37:01 juggled and tap-danced right and it took
37:04 a while to establish the network's
37:06 on-air and to get a formula and there's
37:09 only so many broadcast hours in the day
37:10 at night it went to a test pattern and
37:13 then it went to fuzz that's where you
37:14 see the multi movie poltergeist in 82
37:17 right but Rod Serling talked about
37:20 something very powerful in 59 and he
37:21 said that they knew that they couldn't
37:25 censor a journalist
37:27 because that's against the Constitution
37:30 of the United States and that's against
37:32 sort of the the backbone of what these
37:35 institutions are known for in terms of
37:37 their value proposition to humanity
37:39 right bring me truth
37:41 what rod started talking about was pre
37:45 censorship pretty censorship is to find
37:49 sort of one of two things sort of a
37:52 [ __ ] or a sellout
37:55 looking at both you just went pay dirt
37:58 right but you find someone who believes
38:01 all the doctrine that they are told and
38:02 then you again you treat them like
38:04 mushrooms to put to keep them in the
38:05 dark and feed them to [ __ ] right and
38:07 what they ended up doing was censoring
38:09 the ability of anyone's intellectual
38:11 capacity to see the truth now the
38:14 problem was is that they had individual
38:16 news agencies in all the different
38:18 regions of the world and about a hundred
38:23 years before rods era there was a little
38:29 agency created called Reuters
38:31 yeah I'm unaware of exactly the sort of
38:35 infrastructure that boy ders had in 1850
38:38 but it was an organization founded in
38:40 large part by the Rothschilds and if you
38:45 think about it because you either walked
38:47 outside and accepted reality for what
38:49 you see or you felt like you needed to
38:53 read a newspaper you felt like you
38:55 needed to talk to people or in our era
38:57 watch television look at the Internet
38:58 back in that day waters was tent amount
39:04 to a reality beam of of all existence
39:09 right they would write a story pass it
39:12 around the world as best they could
39:15 cross 1850s we're not quite stringing
39:18 telegraph wires across the ocean but
39:22 they attach credibility to their brand
39:24 and for a while there you just report
39:27 the absolute truth you have to report so
39:30 much truth to keep the illusion going
39:32 and then you can sneak [ __ ] in there
39:34 right I can't remember when The
39:38 Associated Press came about but that was
39:40 another organ
39:41 season founded by independent
39:44 journalists trying to report the truth
39:46 now I'm not sure if writers ever meant
39:48 to do anything but formalize the yellow
39:51 journalism that Hearst mastered over
39:53 here I don't know the by the mid 50s but
39:58 1950s here in America Rod Serling had
40:01 identified that getting the truth out
40:02 was going to become more and more
40:04 difficult due to this pre censorship
40:05 mechanism he invented the series
40:08 Twilight Zone to sneak truth through
40:11 metaphor and themes out of his science
40:14 fiction show because he what he
40:17 understood was that current affairs are
40:19 important but the overall theme of the
40:21 invective humanity and morality is more
40:25 important anything at all when you have
40:28 morality you have safety right obviously
40:34 that's a very subjective concept but
40:36 thou shalt not kill
40:38 that's pretty good starter right don't
40:40 steal from people don't watch out
40:44 Walking Dead I think that's one of the
40:46 commandments but then the news started
40:49 moving into the 60s and this is where
40:53 you know I've mentioned this a couple
40:54 times but this is all in one shot which
40:56 is nice right Marshall McLuhan was a
40:58 philosopher that was really studying
41:00 what he coined as medium or media that's
41:06 his invention his characterization of
41:09 what we have today and what he said in
41:13 what he warned about was the the
41:15 information is not as dangerous as the
41:17 way that the information is brought to
41:20 us and what he was really talking about
41:23 this guy nearly lived a hundred years
41:25 but he had gone from the newspaper day
41:29 to the radio day to the television day
41:31 he had seen it all and what he realized
41:34 was that the credibility and
41:35 infiltration into humanity the more rich
41:39 the medium became it became more a
41:42 priority in someone's life right when it
41:45 was just newspapers now there's some
41:47 guys that read newspapers most people
41:48 didn't when I turned into radio where
41:51 mom can be cutting carrots in the
41:53 kitchen
41:54 and dad can be cleaning the car out in
41:56 the front but you could have the radio
41:58 on and hear things well then it became
42:00 even that much more ubiquitous when it
42:03 turned into a television radio station
42:05 oh my god just looking at people moving
42:07 in a box was the the gimmick which we
42:10 can't recognize it's less than a hundred
42:12 years old people your eyes the people in
42:15 the early 50s were still betting on
42:17 whether or not television would continue
42:19 obviously it took off with the internet
42:23 is the amalgamation of all things
42:25 written text audio news and video news
42:29 and what do we have today we have a new
42:32 addition which is virtual reality
42:35 virtual reality kind of sucks right now
42:38 it does the headsets are horrible wait
42:41 till they become photo real and the
42:44 processors become quantum processing you
42:48 will have infinite processing power and
42:49 you will have incredible resolution
42:53 thank god help us after that but it was
42:57 the sixties in the 70s that transformed
43:00 news from a more sterile cold news to
43:04 what sort of the anchorman 2 was all
43:08 based on the movie the comedy it turned
43:12 into 24-hour fluff news that turned into
43:14 a mechanism by which advertising was
43:17 sold as a primary mechanism for paying
43:19 for everything because the newspaper you
43:22 actually give some money away and even
43:25 the newspapers had to rely on classified
43:27 ads and various advertising in the back
43:29 to pay for the entire production but
43:34 Marshall McLuhan said something very
43:35 interesting he said look because he
43:38 watched news go from having some
43:41 barriers and having some standards we
43:44 don't report these sorts of things
43:45 because it doesn't really matter to the
43:47 rest of world you know back in the 50s
43:50 and 60s you know according to my
43:52 research they didn't report about a
43:54 woman being you know gang raped in the
43:57 park down the street because that was
44:00 her private business and there she's
44:02 already been raped there's very little
44:03 you can do they might talk about a
44:05 rapist that is on the loose and
44:07 he's committed some crimes but the
44:09 details of the crimes the identity of
44:10 the people was never released because we
44:13 had some standards in this world but
44:16 they didn't report you know a Central
44:19 Park raping in Chanute Kansas there's
44:24 nothing we can do about it it doesn't
44:25 help our life but now it's the way to
44:27 scare everyone and make everyone look
44:29 just like rubbernecking on the highway
44:31 right the marshal made a very
44:34 interesting observation about how news
44:36 had gone totally acidic because vietnam
44:38 war was going on while he was just
44:40 blowing up in the mid to late 60s it was
44:43 a great 1968 interview with Marshall
44:45 McLuhan and playboy if you can look that
44:48 up if you can get to the end of that
44:50 interview in one sitting
44:53 you have earned an alkyl aid to because
44:58 it is deep and it is thick okay but what
45:01 he said was this he goes look the reason
45:03 why news is so acidic and so horrible at
45:06 least on one level is that when the
45:07 advertising comes on to tell you
45:09 Palmolive and whatever you feel so good
45:13 and so safe with Palmolive it is the
45:16 teddy bear that you run to to get away
45:19 from all this Vietnam War stuff right
45:21 these horrible embedded videos of bodies
45:24 being blown to pieces now I want to beat
45:29 up something very specifically for the
45:31 newcomers especially and it has to do
45:32 with broadcast speak there's nothing
45:36 more condescending and disingenuous then
45:40 broadcast speak right when someone talks
45:42 to you like this or Wolf Blitzer that
45:45 [ __ ] guy from CNN Jesus Christ if you
45:48 want to see just the epitome of vomitus
45:54 communication styles go watch Wolf
45:56 Blitzer talk he talks like no other
46:01 human being on planet earth and it's his
46:03 shtick and people actually tune in to
46:06 have this sort of you know it's almost
46:10 like a voice box 1.0 out of a timing
46:14 Sinclair computer in 1975 trying to talk
46:16 to you right that's what Blitzer
46:21 but anytime you have someone talking to
46:24 you like a Salesman
46:25 like a broadcast news person you need to
46:30 stop them if they're right in front of
46:32 you and say stop talking to me like that
46:34 I'm a human being
46:36 talk to me like a human being stop
46:39 trying to pretend like you're a part of
46:42 a bigger institution that has rules
46:43 right what's kind of interesting is
46:47 there's a guy in the UK I really like
46:49 and I think he's very genuine and very
46:51 realistic all Watson and he reports for
46:54 Alex Joneses show info wars.com but Paul
46:58 has bought into this almost
47:00 inadvertently this broadcast speak he's
47:02 sort of a mix between Wolf Blitzer and
47:04 homo broadcast speak and he feels like
47:06 that's I believe he feels that that's a
47:08 legitimate of his content and instead of
47:11 just speaking normally I hope he can
47:15 just chill out a little bit and just be
47:18 Paul you know but we need to turn off
47:20 any information coming at us through
47:24 these mechanisms of tonal deafness right
47:30 because those people aren't real it's
47:33 it's almost like the movie they live out
47:35 of 1985 by John Carpenter with the
47:38 Ronnie Piper
47:39 Barney pipe Piper r.i.p my brother you
47:43 put these glasses on you can see the
47:45 aliens that have infiltrated earth and
47:47 you see all the advertising that's
47:48 actually a bunch of subliminal words to
47:51 teach us how to do what we do right if
47:53 you could just sense broadcast speak if
47:56 you can sense salesman speak
47:59 you've got the glasses that they hadn't
48:02 they live but it's just inside your head
48:05 you don't put anything on don't listen
48:09 to it and you know what be kind but if
48:14 you have the power to turn that [ __ ] off
48:16 around your friends and family just grab
48:20 the remote and say look when I watch
48:23 friends when I watch Game of Thrones or
48:26 whatever being how old you are and I see
48:30 people talk like actors and it's it's
48:32 the it's the sitcom
48:34 key way of communicating I accept that
48:36 because I am watching a form of
48:38 entertainment and it's sort of
48:40 vaudeville on television but when I'm
48:42 trying to figure out what the hell's
48:44 going on in the world I don't want
48:45 anyone talking to me in some bizarre
48:48 robotic voice and just point at the
48:51 screen and see look at them listen to
48:53 them they don't talk to us like we're
48:55 normal human beings they're talking to
48:56 us and almost a condescending voice tone
49:00 and that in a subliminal way puts them
49:03 at some professor level and we're at
49:06 some student level constantly so I don't
49:09 think you need anything more than just
49:10 that little litmus test to find out who
49:13 you're gonna listen to and who you're
49:14 not gonna listen to but what makes
49:16 Suffolk news today let's take a major
49:19 brand we won't talk about any one brand
49:21 so you'll get pissed off you know think
49:23 about a brand that you recognize as your
49:25 brand for getting news and hopefully you
49:29 surprise me you don't have a brand
49:30 that's shitty but if it's one of the big
49:32 three letter
49:34 you know acronyms out there you know
49:36 some countries still allow their
49:38 government to finance their their major
49:41 news source it's a government extension
49:44 of their military-industrial complex of
49:47 their political Parliament's and that is
49:50 [ __ ] crazy unbelievable that they
49:54 they know that everything being spoken
49:56 on television is directly been censored
49:58 by their monarchy by their politicians
50:01 by their military industrial complex
50:04 they know and they think they've got
50:07 some freedom which is hilarious
50:09 at least we try to get it keep an
50:11 illusion over here right but the news
50:14 organizations that have come to the top
50:16 which is very interesting because the
50:17 two big ones that are perceived as left
50:20 and the right paradigms of choice and
50:22 pretty much most their cousins they're
50:24 less than 30 years old I mean they the
50:26 actual brands are less than 30 years old
50:28 it's only less than 25 years old but
50:31 what are they what do they sustain
50:33 themselves on the one these the pre
50:36 censorship that Rod Serling talked about
50:38 - they saw the living [ __ ] out of
50:40 advertising so he saw it on television
50:42 and they saw it on the Internet could
50:46 you imagine if television ads
50:48 as bad as internet ads you know these
50:52 stupid galleries of you know they're all
50:54 lies at the bottom of a page they say
50:56 they've got a gallery of one thing and
50:58 it's not there at all they even show you
51:00 a thumbnail that you'll never see if i
51:01 zoom to a picture of if that kind of
51:04 crap was on television I think it would
51:06 expose a lot of the ridiculous nature of
51:09 news to begin with right but now they
51:13 build up something new they built up
51:14 personalities pretty much in the 50s it
51:18 really started but you have these
51:20 individuals that are the people that you
51:22 grow to trust I got the the quote wrong
51:26 and I want to thank the listener
51:27 Francis Bacon was the individual who
51:30 said I think one doth protest too much
51:34 love that line which basically means if
51:36 you lament about something a lot that
51:38 means and you say this is the way you
51:40 are you're exactly the opposite you know
51:43 fair and balanced use you can trust all
51:46 that kind of stuff hmm don't be evil you
51:50 know okay but now there is there are
51:54 direct relationships between news
51:56 organizations and political arteries of
52:01 information if you want to stay in the
52:04 White House you got to not piss off the
52:06 White House if you want to stay embedded
52:08 in the Pentagon you've got to keep the
52:10 Pentagon happy
52:11 and let's just say everyone's are better
52:13 than the Pentagon putting on is happy
52:15 with most folks but in the end the
52:18 Pentagon you want depending on has other
52:20 opportunities and so you Lobby to get
52:23 further embedded and get further
52:24 information inside the Pentagon and they
52:27 could be good and just give it to you or
52:28 the Pentagon could have a general or
52:30 Colonel that just looks at you and says
52:32 what are you gonna give me for this
52:34 right but I'll tell you what ends up
52:37 happening here at some point these
52:40 individuals measure the amount of trust
52:43 that the people give them it's not based
52:46 on real truth but they just measure they
52:49 go well how what kind of load CD ham
52:51 with your with your viewership they say
52:54 well you know and this guy's on it's
52:58 unbelievable he can say anything and
53:00 people believe him eight
53:01 percent she says something it's about
53:05 69% not too bad and they go okay well we
53:09 got some events coming up here they're
53:11 gonna be really hard to digest and you
53:14 know we're it's an inside job so what we
53:16 really got to do is figure out a way to
53:18 keep you know look over here a little
53:21 misdirection so when it comes to let's
53:26 see September 11th let's just say we
53:30 need your and it's between the the times
53:32 of like 8 o'clock and say 11:00 in the
53:35 morning and if you could hold them all
53:37 day it'd be great but it's gonna be a
53:39 lot of tough information coming out but
53:41 we need you to do is just to have that
53:44 guy your most trustworthy assets on on
53:48 the air keep them the whole day make
53:53 sure you're ready to give them what they
53:55 need to stay calm within themselves
53:57 because we're gonna get have a lot of
53:59 tough information we're gonna give you a
54:01 lot of feeds from cameras gonna be
54:05 coming in so just have your your media
54:07 center ready for all these alternative
54:10 views of the day as shippin to you
54:14 satellite we're gonna be running in with
54:16 VHS tapes quarter-inch tapes Ram drives
54:20 whatever get ready and they're able to
54:26 orchestrate things it's beautifully
54:30 beautifully orchestrated evil there's
54:34 nothing special about a reporter
54:36 reporters an actor they don't research
54:39 [ __ ] they don't ever go out and actually
54:41 do anything by themselves besides maybe
54:43 stand out during a riot or a hurricane
54:46 or some [ __ ] but they don't ask any
54:48 questions any real questions but they
54:53 get worshipped right today we actually
54:58 have one journalist out there that is
55:01 the air of one of the families that was
55:05 directly supported and financed by the
55:08 Rothschilds when he went to you after
55:12 you got done you know being silver spoon
55:15 he did his internship at one of the
55:18 three-letter intelligence agencies and
55:21 then became the number one anchor the
55:25 number one celebrated personality on one
55:27 of the news agencies you couldn't you
55:32 couldn't come up with a more convincing
55:33 story about a single individual going in
55:38 to be a reporter for a national news
55:39 organization than that organization he's
55:42 part of an elite family Rothschild
55:45 connected I mean 100% their family got
55:48 rich because they were financed by the
55:50 Rothschilds from the 1850s - today -
55:53 today he goes and gets trained by the
55:58 one organization that is single-handedly
56:01 responsible for destroying this country
56:03 and we're undoing that today which is
56:05 great
56:05 and then he goes into a major news
56:09 organization and he doesn't have to cut
56:11 his teeth man he doesn't go off and
56:13 report hurricanes for two years he goes
56:15 straight to the front of the line
56:17 because grandma's got juice but when he
56:22 meets all the social demographics that
56:24 you know is of the age right I mean the
56:29 if they could construct an infiltrator
56:32 or a reporter that could sway people by
56:36 hand like an Edward Scissorhands type
56:38 situation they couldn't get a better
56:41 result in this student but what happens
56:44 to a news organization that has to pay
56:47 its bills if you want to create your own
56:50 news organization how would you do it
56:51 right you gotta pay the bills you can't
56:55 just make you know a twenty thousand
56:58 person staff and bet all around the
57:02 world and have all these credentials and
57:03 be able to fly and edit you know shoot
57:06 and edit and report without billions of
57:09 dollars of investment
57:11 well the actually silly way to do it
57:14 which would probably work better than
57:15 what goes on is to have the government
57:19 allocate a certain amount of funds to
57:21 fund independent news organizations
57:24 without any involvement with all kinds
57:26 of laws about
57:27 you know conflicts of interest and
57:31 what-have-you and the people vote
57:35 whether or not that news organizations
57:36 doing a good job and if they get voted
57:39 out for a line everyone loses their job
57:43 and a new organization is funded that's
57:47 a little silly but that's that's one way
57:50 to do it but the other way to do it is
57:51 to sell advertising and the interesting
57:55 thing is there's plenty of advertising
57:57 out there that's decent what's
57:59 interesting about Europe is that Europe
58:01 has had advertising in a bulk chunk
58:06 format for quite some time I think
58:08 they've lost that format now but there
58:09 used to be a time when you had 20
58:11 minutes ads and then you'd watch the
58:13 whole show complete and then 20 minutes
58:14 adds but the ads were they had had more
58:17 integrity you'd actually sit and watch
58:18 him because it was kind of perceived as
58:20 news well there's that new product oh
58:22 yeah there's the new Mustang or whatever
58:25 right but as long as the news
58:27 organization is doing well and the real
58:30 news is bringing in the eyeballs and
58:32 it's selling ads everything's great but
58:37 the second that there's a bump in the
58:38 road and the ads the numbers go down
58:43 then you might actually pull a few
58:45 tricks out of your are out of your
58:48 sleeve right I think I mentioned this
58:51 once before but since we're on this
58:53 there's the series on HBO it's long gone
58:56 it was carnival it's about a carnival
58:59 that goes around it's an amazing two
59:01 season stretch it's it's probably one of
59:04 those perfect things ever created on
59:05 television but they have this time when
59:10 they can't seem to find anyone to come
59:12 to their their carnival and so the guy
59:15 that League guys Sampson pulls all the
59:19 tricks out and they create a bunch of
59:21 like they create a big bunch of oddities
59:23 and stuff using all kinds of props and
59:25 stuff and it's sort of like a gag night
59:28 to get everyone to come and see it and
59:30 that's what happens with organizations
59:34 when they're in dire straits when
59:37 they're having a problem I guarantee you
59:39 car dealerships that are having
59:41 really bad time making ends meet man do
59:44 they ever pull out every single stop in
59:46 the book swapping tires in the back
59:47 after they sell the car screwing people
59:51 in all kinds of claims that the cars
59:53 have features that they don't have now
59:54 we've got protection agencies not a
59:56 little bit better at helping out on that
59:58 jewelry stores that will say they're
60:00 gonna clean your jewelry after you pick
60:02 it out of the the case and they go and
60:04 swap the diamonds in the back and this
60:07 is what happens with news news goes
60:09 crazy when they can't pay the bills
60:12 there's more murder there's more rape
60:14 there's more stuff that doesn't relate
60:16 to your reality when you wake up we have
60:19 news organizations online that are
60:20 absolutely insane they're completely
60:23 fake 100% all they're doing is selling
60:25 advertising around fake news articles
60:27 the headlines of the news articles are
60:29 written to just create curiosity lacking
60:32 the words to conclude what the articles
60:34 actually about they start off with
60:36 ridiculous raises like you won't believe
60:39 what so-and-so said don't click that
60:41 [ __ ] just do me a favor right and
60:45 then we have trusted names that have
60:47 been out there forever and they're lying
60:48 their asses off nowadays and what is
60:51 their defense their defense is they
60:53 there's no way that a news agency can
60:56 apologize for telling lies and survive
60:58 you just can't yeah it's not like a
61:02 marriage where you can say you know
61:03 honey I just slept with your sister but
61:05 I won't do it again you know you might
61:07 have a chance in hell of surviving that
61:09 but a news agency can't survive that and
61:14 so now their big thing is they'll say
61:18 that if a person says a news article is
61:20 fake their defense is you just don't
61:22 like the truth Wow
61:24 that's doubling down on the sin of lying
61:27 to society right it means that those
61:32 organizations are so committed to their
61:36 process of lying that they just don't
61:40 give a [ __ ] anymore and it's it's the
61:43 reason to shut them down and with all
61:48 due haste right it is the reason to stop
61:51 watching them crush their viewership
61:54 I know what some of you're saying you're
61:55 saying well hey man there are people out
61:58 there that still believe that [ __ ]
62:00 yes you are correct the only thing I can
62:04 tell you that that warms my heart about
62:07 these individuals is that it's not a
62:09 sustainable model right you can't
62:12 [ __ ] yourself every single day of
62:14 your life and actually sustain life yet
62:18 can't and so they are sort of in their
62:22 own death spiral believing in [ __ ]
62:25 because let's face it this country since
62:29 the assassination of John F Kennedy has
62:34 gone utterly downhill with Shelley
62:37 [ __ ] presidents or in one case I
62:40 think a president that thought he was
62:41 president for a little while and
62:42 realized his vice president was the
62:44 president and suddenly it's as if the
62:49 Train it's been on this [ __ ] rail to
62:52 hell has jumped the tracks sprung wings
62:56 turbine jets have come out it's been
62:59 encapsulated and something can exist and
63:01 you know zero gravity and no atmosphere
63:04 and we are we are often a totally
63:06 different vector only bummers we have to
63:10 take all these idiots with us just
63:13 imagine right
63:15 imagine the news on any one particular
63:18 day if you if you're not driving your
63:20 car just close your eyes and say think
63:23 about it I switch on a new news program
63:26 and every single person I'm listening to
63:29 is talking to me like the dude I'm
63:31 listening to right now just like a
63:33 normal human being and they're allowed
63:38 to have an opinion
63:39 they're allowed to observe they're
63:42 allowed to be normal when something's
63:44 funny they can laugh when something's
63:46 sad they can cry normal human beings and
63:52 they can insert a bunch of you know
63:56 qualifications and say well we have been
64:00 trying to figure out what's going on
64:01 right here we heard there was an
64:02 explosion whatever we don't know exactly
64:04 what's going on because we only have one
64:07 witness were not sharing that
64:09 information because it could be
64:11 inaccurate right you know if you Nev you
64:16 been in business there's the whole thing
64:17 of someone asking you what price you
64:21 charge before they've told you the scope
64:24 of their project and they always do that
64:26 this [ __ ] wormy bastards that do that
64:28 right to say you know like if someone
64:31 call you hey do you build houses yeah I
64:32 do well how much is it to build a house
64:35 well what are you you know you're
64:38 looking for a 2,000 square feet 5000
64:40 script well I just want to know how much
64:41 it cost before I decide just hang up the
64:45 phone on those people just hang it up
64:47 you're awful human beings right well the
64:51 problem is is you can even have a good
64:53 person on the other side the phone cuz
64:56 misunderstanding of the process works
64:57 and as soon as you tell what price they
64:59 can't get that price other head and the
65:00 same thing goes with the eye witness of
65:02 one you can never redo it that's why
65:05 front page news is so incredibly
65:08 damaging when it's a lie because no one
65:11 reads the retraction seven days later so
65:14 how did we conclude this it's get long
65:17 here's what I suggest I want you to take
65:21 inventory in your life of how goddamnit
65:23 important all this [ __ ] is in the
65:25 first place and in the way that you find
65:28 out how important it is is ask yourself
65:32 when have you been utterly surprised in
65:35 your life at a point where it was just
65:37 oh my god you know soldiers came into my
65:40 house and you know held me at gunpoint
65:42 and I didn't know what was going on
65:44 how does someone getting raped 3,000
65:48 miles away from you affect you
65:49 personally do you really need to drag
65:51 their entire family into the press and
65:53 know their names and send them a letter
65:55 so they can't close off the can't get
65:58 closure on the event you really have to
66:01 know all the gory details of how you
66:03 know George Michael died do you really
66:05 have to know is it your [ __ ] business
66:08 right if they're dead they're dead
66:11 unless you have a machine that can bring
66:13 dead people back to life without any
66:16 weird you know Pet Sematary problems
66:19 then they're dead
66:20 and you obviously hope that the locals
66:24 will take care of any wrongdoing
66:31 now I'm as guilty as anybody and wanting
66:33 to know what's going on in the world
66:35 looking at the big picture but I think
66:39 that in if I could teach a class on such
66:43 a thing I would say show me that you
66:45 appreciate the life around you first
66:47 show me that you're plugged into what's
66:49 going on right in front of your face if
66:50 you have kids
66:52 show me that you're paying attention to
66:54 them first and then we can graduate into
66:59 a 200 class where we actually start
67:01 worrying about Foreign Affairs about you
67:04 know the state next to you about the
67:07 state that you live in because
67:10 understanding the news requires that you
67:12 have a vocation to understand it right
67:15 people will pass around all this
67:17 [ __ ] about you know the economy
67:19 crashing and yes there's plenty experts
67:22 online to do this really well but
67:24 there's a lot of folks that will pass
67:25 that misery and that negativity around
67:28 but they have no idea how money is
67:29 created in the first place how it has
67:31 any value when you say IMF a BIS or the
67:35 World Bank they have no idea what you're
67:38 talking about but they got an opinion
67:40 because they want to feel smart I know
67:44 you feel me I just I wanted to put a
67:47 finer point on the subatomic meaning of
67:50 what news is and this foe level of
67:54 importance it is twerked for our lives
67:56 in this idea that suddenly you know my
67:59 English teacher in Kansas is a
68:00 globalists and she's totally aware of
68:03 you know and and needs to know whether
68:06 or not Italy is going to you know halt
68:08 EU expansion it's like we're all insane
68:12 a little bit it's time to sober up man
68:16 less is more I could do a part two on
