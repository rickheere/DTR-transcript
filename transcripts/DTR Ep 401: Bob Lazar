00:28 welcome to season five ladies and
00:31 gentlemen it's I think it's August 22nd
00:34 here about to pop out the new season I
00:37 got at least 12 episodes in the queue
00:40 I think all of them night episodes but
00:42 hopefully they they've got the goods
00:45 hope you guys dug the new intro I worked
00:47 on that quite a bit I got so much extra
00:50 footage from what I was putting together
00:53 so what I'm gonna do with the season 5
00:55 intro because intros are kind of you
00:59 know the music is always gonna stay the
01:00 same but the I'm gonna keep tweaking it
01:04 from time to time so you're gonna see
01:06 that intro change as I push myself
01:09 through some more visual effects and
01:11 there's just some things I wanted wanted
01:14 to do which I wasn't able to kind of
01:16 push it all together plus I want to tap
01:17 a few friends of mine and see what they
01:19 come up with so we'll make that fun I'll
01:23 be kind like the Simpsons you know and
01:24 it starts it's it's always different now
01:26 it's like it'd be different every single
01:27 time but it'll be different on a nice
01:30 surprising interval so I had some fun
01:34 with that and what what a season 5 intro
01:39 with a flying saucer B without an
01:41 opening episode about a gentleman who
01:45 said he worked on secret UFOs and a
01:50 secret base called s4 a gentleman by the
01:55 name of Bob Lazar and so you know I've
02:00 been thinking about this guy and wanting
02:01 to cover him for a long time and then
02:03 just miraculously last year they came
02:06 out with a documentary arm which I saw
02:08 this year and you know I have this
02:12 obviously a soft spot for the subject
02:15 matter because like most of you who
02:16 would love to believe that we have
02:18 neighbors in the universe to also have
02:25 have completed this this communication
02:29 the thing where we found each other in
02:32 the universe it's exciting
02:37 isn't it that that would be the
02:39 storyline now I followed Bob since I
02:45 heard of the guy which is probably in
02:47 the 90s on television shows you know I
02:51 was there with everybody else then when
02:53 YouTube came out a lot of old footage
02:55 from the 90s like you know interviews
02:57 with him and town hall meetings you know
03:01 with a whole group of people and so I've
03:05 been on the Lazar bandwagon I listen to
03:09 his buddy John Lear talk at length I
03:12 think John Lee are certifiable I think
03:15 that he is a bad sign up if he is not
03:18 crazy and he could be either one I think
03:23 that I watched the whole Bob Lazar
03:26 documentary and I thought well man this
03:27 is like totally even more real than I
03:30 thought before but then I started
03:34 thinking logically as we do on this show
03:37 and a bunch of stuff doesn't make sense
03:40 so what we're gonna do is we're gonna go
03:44 through the official story of this guy
03:47 they're gonna ask some serious questions
03:49 about this dude because I think there's
03:54 something extremely endearing about
03:55 Bob's character right he's not one of
03:57 these dudes who exudes any need to have
04:01 attention even if that's what he does
04:03 need he doesn't give off a single quaff
04:07 of that vibe his story is generally
04:12 stayed the same from the very beginning
04:15 I think that I've heard him say that you
04:20 know we're gonna get into it but that of
04:23 the ships that he witnessed in this
04:25 secret bunker which is underneath a
04:28 mountain sort of like the mountain side
04:31 it's just like James Bond man you know
04:33 the the doors are painted to look like
04:34 the mountain and so when they fall back
04:37 all of a sudden there's an opening and
04:39 then you go inside and the only reason
04:41 why those doors exist is because at some
04:43 point you need to take the craps out as
04:47 I first heard the story from him in the
04:50 night
04:50 I tried to find this document is but a
04:55 lot of his old videos have been wiped
04:56 out and in place of those old videos
05:01 there is the new documentary new
05:03 document it's almost like they cleaned
05:06 up the story of this guy to push it out
05:09 there we know that there's been this
05:12 buzz on the internet for last 5 to 10
05:15 years for those people who were paying
05:18 attention to von Braun's secretary from
05:21 1978 up when he died the story about a
05:25 fake alien invasion to unify the world
05:28 because at this stage freedom is
05:31 starting to poke its head up like the
05:34 the rose bush that's growing out of the
05:36 nuclear waste of our current society and
05:40 so they need to kind of pull us all
05:42 together so why not brush the dust off
05:46 of people like Bob Lazar clean up the
05:49 story but there's counter theories to
05:53 that idea as well because if they really
05:55 wanted to blow the dust off this guy and
05:57 clean him up someone would find some of
05:59 the records of his existence beyond the
06:02 one entry in the Los Alamos labs
06:04 phonebook well we'll get into that as
06:07 well so Bob Lazar is born on like it's
06:12 January 26 1959 he's currently 60 years
06:16 old
06:17 the documentary actually opened up a lot
06:22 more information about his past that I
06:24 didn't know anything about which was his
06:25 utter obsession with jet engines and
06:30 that he actually had this car that he
06:35 would take to events and it would have
06:37 the jet engine in the back and you know
06:39 he'd do a little stunt driving it and
06:41 what-have-you I didn't know anything
06:43 about that at all
06:44 and I didn't know anything about his
06:46 current business which is making
06:47 fireworks which is cool if you go into
06:51 his I Wikipedia it says that he's a film
06:53 processor not sure exactly what category
06:57 film processing he's in I don't care
06:59 quite frankly
07:02 I never heard about him engaging in
07:05 illegal acts like running a brothel and
07:08 getting busted in the early 90s he
07:11 literally as a felon can own a gun can't
07:15 vote he's a felon but he only had to
07:18 serve like 150 days in community service
07:21 so in terms of obeying the laws of this
07:26 country of ours he perceives himself
07:30 outside them he's not a Hugh Hefner
07:34 so maybe just the sheer the this year
07:40 high of being around women and everybody
07:43 being accessible maybe that was part of
07:45 it like he's his own doctor Detroit you
07:49 know have you ever seen that dan Aykroyd
07:51 movie there is a weird psychological
07:56 thing for me because the uncle I always
07:58 tell you guys about that taught me
08:01 everything they look similar they have a
08:05 very similar appearance and so for me
08:08 there's part of that it's just that vibe
08:10 of integrity and amazing brilliance the
08:13 same kind of things that bob lazar knows
08:16 and studies they're the same exact
08:18 things that my uncle studied and taught
08:22 me so the story as it goes is that you
08:26 have because we have to kind of jump
08:28 around in time to get this thing to
08:30 match the way that Bob talks about his
08:32 own life and then we have to go back and
08:36 then do the research on his claims
08:40 because what it's what happened to this
08:42 whole thing I believe that the first
08:45 official kind of outward facing step
08:49 that Bob did was he went to a guy named
08:51 George Knapp K and a P P George Knapp
08:55 was a I think he still is but he was a
08:59 kind of an investigative journalist for
09:03 the Las Vegas TV station klas and he
09:07 said I'm about to break something I've
09:11 been working at this special facility
09:14 which is a spin
09:15 of area51 called s4 I've been working on
09:20 this UFO and it has an antimatter engine
09:26 that is far beyond anything mankind has
09:28 ever conceived of or created in our
09:31 current era the materials of which the
09:34 ship were made out of completely beyond
09:36 anything that we've ever messed with the
09:39 propulsion system is using an element
09:42 115 which we haven't synthesized yet
09:44 because systems of the early 90s we
09:47 don't understand antimatter that well
09:50 and there's nine craft and total eight
09:53 other craft that I didn't work on he
09:57 calls his craft because it was uninjured
09:59 and it looked cool the sports model the
10:03 initial testimonies I heard from him out
10:07 of his own voice with his own face was
10:09 at the other eight were injured in some
10:11 way shape or fashion they had been shot
10:13 down they had mechanical functions
10:16 whatever the case might have been they
10:18 were all damaged and his was perfect
10:22 first time I ever heard him talk about
10:24 walking out to this craft he said that
10:27 he wasn't allowed to look at the other
10:31 craft he did out of the kind of corner
10:33 of his eye but now he never seems to
10:35 mention those sort of militant the
10:38 circumstances around his employment but
10:41 he goes this george knapp guy he says
10:43 look I'm in trouble I think I'm about to
10:46 get fired I want to bust this store
10:49 story wide open so I'm gonna take you
10:52 around to some places where you can get
10:55 clearance to verify that I do work at
10:57 these facilities or have work for these
10:59 facilities are gone through these
11:00 facilities to get to where I go and then
11:03 we'll do like a shrouded interview you
11:07 know where he is shrouded in a shadow
11:09 which they made him sit in a Bronco and
11:11 they filmed him and he gave his
11:12 testimony that he was doing this and
11:15 they broke it on you know the news one
11:17 evening seemed like it was live then of
11:22 course he does get fired and so now he
11:25 doesn't give a crap and now he
11:28 goes on camera starts telling the whole
11:31 story everything I just told you the
11:35 George Knapp guys like well you know I
11:37 don't know if I believe this guy yet so
11:39 let me do my investigation I don't know
11:43 when they found his name in the Los
11:44 Alamos lab phone book
11:48 the big thing about that is that you
11:51 could be a mail guy
11:52 it doesn't say Bob Lazar physicist
11:56 it just says pop Lazar and a number
11:59 supposedly Knapp talked to people that
12:01 said at the Air Force Base or wherever
12:04 he took off to go to area 51 which is in
12:08 a plane supposedly with no windows for
12:11 the passengers and they said oh yeah
12:12 that guy works at area 51
12:14 ok so George is pretty convinced and
12:21 then they they arrange the sort of coup
12:25 de Gras to his integrity which is to do
12:27 a lie detector test now I have heard and
12:30 coast to coast am I'm pretty sure in the
12:35 early 2000s that Bob Lazar was given
12:39 literally nearly three dozen
12:42 lie-detector tests but in the
12:44 documentary and all the recent stuff
12:46 I've seen he's only had one lie-detector
12:49 test and it was the testimony of the
12:52 dude who gave him the test where he said
12:55 look I don't know if this guy really
12:56 works on UFOs but he thinks he does
12:58 because he gave no physical indication
13:00 that he's lying all right and we all
13:05 want Bob to win we want him to win yes
13:08 prove that you have this background that
13:12 you went and did this and then prove to
13:14 us that you truly worked on the UFO
13:21 but now let's let's break for a second
13:24 on this idea because there are people
13:26 who are great storytellers most of them
13:30 are authors writers Michael Crichton's
13:32 I mean if they took the story of
13:35 Jurassic Park for instance finding an
13:38 amber encapsulated mosquito with the DNA
13:43 of a dinosaur in it and then told the
13:44 public that they are now set the sizing
13:46 dinosaurs and some far-off island
13:49 somewhere and they had done it and they
13:52 push this rumor out there I think most
13:55 people due to the fact that it has
13:57 credibility it has a scientific theory
13:59 to it but laymen especially not maybe a
14:03 microbiologist or someone who knows
14:05 genetics genetic engineering maybe they
14:07 would be like you're ridiculous that'll
14:09 never work
14:09 but the layman's going to believe it so
14:14 I'm here to tell you that I haven't
14:16 heard a single thing from Bob Lazar that
14:20 I wouldn't credit someone in his era
14:23 being born in 59 going up through it
14:25 growing up through a great educational
14:27 system the 60s and the 70s which means
14:29 Bob graduates high school roughly in
14:31 1978 the school systems were fantastic
14:35 the creativity that they taught was
14:37 fantastic the science that they thought
14:38 was fantastic there's a reason why my
14:41 uncle had the same level of intellectual
14:43 prowess I mean you know just legit
14:45 science so we can't rule out of my
14:51 opinion the fact that Bob could just be
14:53 one of the most creative and brilliant
14:56 people in his field of fiction we know
15:01 he built you know turbine cars turbine
15:04 vehicles we know that he understands a
15:05 tremendous amount of science due to his
15:07 United nuclear company he's just a
15:13 gadget guy no matter what it's true he's
15:16 the gadget guy I mean the guy can build
15:17 fireworks and he could film process
15:20 whatever the [ __ ] that means so he's
15:25 he's gifted but now what do they say
15:28 about this guy because we're gonna dig
15:30 deeper now he claims to have a physics
15:34 degree from
15:34 MIT and Caltech now he has proof that in
15:39 1970 which I don't quite understand are
15:43 in the 70s I should say he went to a
15:45 Pierce junior college in Los Angeles
15:50 okay I'm a junior college kid as well
15:53 that is why I do not have a degree I
15:56 went to college as a mirror recreational
15:59 thing almost almost paused my career in
16:03 the early 90s to go off and get a degree
16:04 and was talked out of it by my second
16:08 cousin he was got a PhD in chemistry and
16:10 he said why waste your time doing that
16:11 and he goes I wasted 10 12 years of my
16:14 life in college and I lost all those
16:17 beautiful years he goes don't do that
16:19 you already know how to do what you do
16:20 just keep doing it keep educating
16:23 yourself which was a stunner I thought
16:26 that guy would be yeah great get your
16:28 degree and hope he's like don't waste
16:30 your life here and merck pharmaceutical
16:33 for a couple decades he's a genius so I
16:38 was like okay fine I'll stick to my guns
16:40 and it was very good that I did because
16:42 what happened to my life literally that
16:45 year was utterly phenomenal Caltech is
16:48 in Pasadena California MIT is in
16:52 Cambridge Massachusetts I lived in
16:56 Massachusetts for two and a half years
16:58 and my father and I would routinely go
17:00 on little drives on the weekend because
17:02 he's a photographer
17:03 we just drive by the Harvard and Caltech
17:06 and I'm sorry MIT excuse me and I was I
17:09 you know I love science and so going by
17:11 these institutions even though I could
17:13 barely conceive of what they were I knew
17:16 that they were the top schools in the
17:17 world and I would have been an MIT kid
17:19 not a Harvard kid it Caltech I mean
17:24 Caltech is huge I mean around here it is
17:29 the number one tech school in the world
17:31 bar none so let's review he says he has
17:38 degrees physics degrees no less from the
17:40 top tech schools in the world meaning
17:41 the curriculum by which you have to
17:44 study to get degrees at these schools is
17:46 of the utmost complexity
17:50 except what's the problem the problem is
17:55 is the only proof and so what is the big
18:00 cover story for him not having proof he
18:02 went to these two top tech schools I
18:04 mean a degree from each one of them
18:08 unbelievable the claim on this student
18:11 first let me just tell you if someone's
18:13 gonna tell a bold lie and he and I I
18:16 mentioned this episode a lot but in the
18:17 Twilight Zone series go look up frisbee
18:21 the great frisbee I think it was what is
18:23 the title the episode is it's an old man
18:25 who owns a convenience store who
18:27 perpetually lies about all the degrees
18:31 he has he had it I think he had his his
18:34 degrees up to like 36 degrees or
18:37 something like that 30 to 36 degrees and
18:39 all these things no matter what you
18:41 mentioned he invented it and he broke
18:43 all the world records etc etc it's a
18:45 fantastic episode is where the Robert
18:51 are served
18:52 Rick Gervase movie about a world that
18:57 didn't understand a lie that's where
18:59 that episode was lifted from it's also
19:02 where the end of Mars attack was lifted
19:04 from with the harmonica
19:05 he had a harmonica he played and it
19:07 would freak out the aliens and the
19:10 aliens in Mars attack would listen to
19:13 what was it I want to say Roy Orbison
19:16 but it may not be that but that that old
19:18 country song that blew up their brains
19:20 right anyway if you were a person who
19:26 needed to sort of validate yourself in a
19:28 scientific way those are the two schools
19:31 you would lie about if you really
19:33 understood where the two best schools in
19:35 the world would be you'd say now okay if
19:42 you're going to go to school how does
19:46 this work how does your undergrad work
19:49 for years and if you were accomplishing
19:53 a degree in less than four years there
19:56 are going to be people on campus who
19:57 remember you graduating faster than four
19:59 years in your undergrad
20:01 now in the notes that I find online I
20:04 don't know which degree he said he got
20:06 you know whether one was an undergrad
20:08 and one was his graduate degree I don't
20:10 have that information but we're gonna
20:12 cover it because what your graduate
20:14 degree usually take usually takes about
20:16 three years and two if you're really
20:19 aggressive so he says that they erased
20:22 his records and technically speaking
20:25 when they say they have no records of
20:27 you doing this and no records of that
20:28 okay so you get rid of records that just
20:31 means they formerly didn't write it down
20:32 they got rid of any papers that said
20:34 they wrote it down that's not enough to
20:37 disbelieve someone in his particular
20:39 situation it's very cleverly stated as a
20:43 matter of fact by these institutions to
20:45 remove liability should they be caught
20:48 in the lie but now let me ask you and
20:54 this just happened to me in the last 24
20:56 hours of studying this and rethinking it
20:58 through I think he's lying about both
21:01 degrees and I tell you by I
21:04 unequivocally think he's lying about
21:05 both degrees
21:07 doesn't mean he's not a genius and that
21:09 he wouldn't be solicited by someone but
21:11 we're gonna get into how he got into
21:12 this program in the first place which is
21:14 also rather difficult to believe how
21:18 many of you went to college four years
21:22 four-year college one if you go to a
21:25 four-year college you don't usually go
21:26 to a junior college first if you could
21:28 get capable of getting in to MIT and
21:30 Caltech the one a couple things are true
21:34 you don't need a junior college unless
21:36 you're doing it as a teenager simply to
21:38 get some prerequisites all worked out
21:40 you can get some credits going now just
21:45 so that you know a Harvard Law degree
21:46 today costs five hundred thousand
21:49 dollars one of my friends sent his kid
21:51 in he got his to greet graduate top in
21:54 his class I don't know what a physics
21:56 degree cost at MIT and I don't know what
21:58 it would have cost in say 78 let's just
22:02 say comes right out of high school go
22:04 straight into MIT I am willing to bet
22:07 that that degree you could buy a
22:10 Corvette for $8,000 so
22:14 his family would have had to have
22:16 coughed up a lot of money I'm gonna say
22:20 at least a hundred grand to get him the
22:22 tuition fees to go through MIT that
22:25 doesn't account for because he would
22:27 have been there when I was there if he
22:29 went off to MIT first he would have been
22:31 there in the early 80s right when I
22:33 moved there it would have been extremely
22:36 expensive to live there boss does not a
22:39 cheap place okay
22:44 so in you know any of you who've sent
22:47 your kid off to college or any of you've
22:48 just been there and your parents were
22:50 with you you know there's a lot of
22:51 logistics going on you've got to get a
22:52 place to live you have an address and if
22:56 you spend four years in an educational
22:58 institution yeah there weren't cell
22:59 phones and there weren't cameras around
23:01 everywhere but you would take a picture
23:03 of being there you take a picture of the
23:05 campus you take a picture of your
23:07 friends and you would have friends from
23:09 college you always do where's bob lazar
23:14 his friends I mean I don't give a [ __ ]
23:17 if the dude says I was in arid and I
23:18 didn't have any friends that's [ __ ]
23:20 I have spent my entire life hanging out
23:23 with the jocks on one side and the mutts
23:25 in the middle where I live belonged and
23:27 the Nerds on the Left friends with all
23:31 three groups I know that every single
23:33 one of these folks has a best friend
23:36 from these institutions at least one at
23:39 least one why isn't he pulling those
23:42 people into the documentary and saying
23:44 well this is Bob he went to MIT as well
23:46 there's his degree Bob do you remember
23:48 me his name's Bob I shouldn't use that
23:50 but Dan you know Dan hey Dan got a
23:53 degree in physics as well he was right
23:55 there beside me here's a photograph of
23:57 he and I at our graduation what happens
24:00 when you graduate let's say one of two
24:04 things has occurred here his family came
24:07 up with whatever money it cost seventy
24:08 five hundred grand to get him to MIT and
24:12 then he graduates he gets a degree in
24:14 physics well what happens when that
24:16 happens you get a book you get your gown
24:19 you get your tassel you get photographs
24:22 taken of you your family comes out to
24:24 see you graduate your relatives know you
24:26 graduated the whole family wouldn't know
24:28 all your friends would know I are you
24:31 gonna not tell your friends you went to
24:32 MIT seriously in four years you never
24:35 took any pictures and maybe claims you
24:37 went to Caltech first just apply
24:38 everything over it's absurd that he has
24:42 absolutely no personal records of ever
24:44 going to MIT and that nobody ever
24:46 remembers him that either institution
24:48 the CIA can't kill every single person
24:50 who saw a student at a particular
24:52 college they wouldn't even know who
24:55 remembered the guy professors professors
25:00 would have records of these of these
25:02 prodigy kids coming through the school
25:04 obviously Bob Lazar according to his own
25:07 claims is a prodigy he would have sailed
25:10 through my physics teacher in high
25:12 school remembers me 100% he said I was
25:17 his number two student of his whole
25:18 career number one did Google Maps port
25:22 from Windows to Mac my physics teacher
25:25 thinks he invented it so that's why he's
25:26 number one but whatever but my fit my
25:29 physics teacher twenty years after no
25:31 [ __ ] yeah well at least 20 years after I
25:33 had walked out of his class for the last
25:35 time I sat on the phone with the guy and
25:38 he's remembering multiple events in
25:40 school I remember the first time I asked
25:43 you about black holes remember the first
25:44 time we talked about Eagles MC squared
25:45 you were such a pain yes he remembers me
25:49 nobody remembers Bob Lazar you don't
25:52 have any professors who were in their
25:54 20s or early 30s who are still alive
25:56 today we could talk to you I know people
25:59 died but damn Bob is not that old Bob is
26:02 60 years old today their professors were
26:06 probably 10 to 15 years older than him
26:07 which means today the only 75 years old
26:10 not dead somebody should remember this
26:13 guy I mean you give him a point but
26:15 don't let that slide where was his
26:18 address but you have some mail from
26:21 those areas I don't you have something
26:22 you know when I went to Boston here's
26:24 something about Boston you need to
26:25 understand it's a tourist trap of
26:28 tourist traps it is the is the Lexington
26:31 bridge foundational land that this
26:33 revolution was fought on from you know
26:36 the first shot that's shot on the
26:38 Lexington bridge to the last time we
26:39 kicked people out in 1812 it's a law
26:42 Worman he would have pictures with him
26:45 next to the Minuteman the Ironsides
26:48 someplace beach pictures whatever he
26:50 would have gotten out and done some
26:51 stuff no evidence at all now somebody
26:55 said again this is just absolute hearsay
26:58 but somebody said look in Los Angeles I
27:02 remember taking Bob to Caltech to drop
27:06 him off at school okay
27:09 well I used to go to Stanford all the
27:10 time I never was a Stanford student so
27:15 maybe you went to Caltech rewind all
27:18 those claims that we just made for MIT
27:19 and put them against Caltech you went to
27:22 the number one science school on this
27:26 thing we call Planet Earth and you have
27:29 no evidence you have no diploma papers
27:31 you've got no pictures of ever being
27:33 there you have no friends from Caltech
27:35 that remember you it's I think a
27:38 physical and mental impossibility that
27:41 he has degrees from either one of these
27:43 places and has nothing to show for it
27:45 zero they pointed a camera at him during
27:48 a documentary
27:51 he didn't say okay come on back come on
27:53 back to my room you know he moves a
27:55 couple books away pulls out his degrees
27:57 and shows them to the camera none of
27:58 that ever happened here's a photograph
28:00 one two three of me in Massachusetts
28:03 over four years okay here's a three-year
28:05 degree graduate degree from Caltech
28:08 can you really get to graduate to
28:11 undergrad degrees no you get one's got
28:13 to be a graduate degree one's got to be
28:14 an undergrad you just have to have it
28:15 that way
28:16 MIT definitely acknowledges Cal Tech's
28:19 degrees and Caltech definitely
28:20 acknowledges MIT degrees so you would
28:22 stair step up but now some people say
28:24 okay I got you I got you but he's in a
28:29 phonebook at at Los Alamos labs and the
28:33 answer is definitely yes he is I don't
28:38 think anyone carries around the name Bob
28:41 Lazar it's it really what's great about
28:44 his name is that la ZAR is an extremely
28:49 unique name so finding it in a directory
28:52 is great evidence that some
28:55 happened but now how does he get
28:59 involved with this incredibly covert
29:01 project well the truth in matter is is
29:04 that if you were a star student one
29:07 everybody would remember you again
29:09 okay there'd be dozens of people that
29:11 would know Bob Lazar was the kid who
29:13 just burned through school like you know
29:16 a hot iron through butter
29:18 you get remembered for those kind of
29:20 things he said he met teller
29:24 William teller the duty invents the
29:26 hydrogen bomb and that teller said
29:30 you're a genius
29:31 you're great we need some new minds
29:33 because we've stalled out on this
29:34 project can't tell you what it is just
29:36 yet but you'll find out and I'm gonna
29:38 get you through all the security checks
29:41 and we're gonna evaluate your brain a
29:42 little bit further and I'm gonna get you
29:44 into this s4 project one this means that
29:47 tellers walking around with s4 knowledge
29:49 and alien knowledge and all this other
29:50 stuff now tell her he says he doesn't
29:58 remember Bob but he was kind of gentle
30:00 about he was like you know I'm not
30:01 saying I'm an old man so I don't
30:03 remember everybody I mean I'm famous so
30:04 what can you do man you meet people and
30:06 you don't remember but now think about
30:08 it tell her this is like us having a
30:11 conversation with teller mr. teller I
30:16 understand if you don't remember putting
30:17 your pants on I understand if you don't
30:20 recall what you had for breakfast and
30:21 it's evening today I understand those
30:23 kind of like slips and thoughts right
30:26 but nothing about it how many times do
30:30 you think about the fact that human
30:32 beings are supposedly in contact with
30:34 aliens and we have nine of their ships
30:36 and you found a guy that you thought was
30:40 appropriate to push into the program to
30:43 study the antimatter engines of the best
30:46 UFO we have you don't remember that
30:50 so if Teller did participate in Bob
30:56 lazarre's progression and introduction
30:59 into this program then
31:04 he's lying if you did definitely line
31:08 you don't forget that kind of stuff
31:10 long-term memory for people losing their
31:12 short-term memory due to Alzheimer's or
31:13 dementia you remember your long-term
31:15 stuff you don't remember anything that
31:17 happened recently
31:18 case in point my grandmother who passed
31:22 away of dementia she had to mention her
31:25 son some sort I never saw her have
31:27 dementia because when I walked in the
31:28 door
31:29 I'm long-term memory she called out my
31:32 name immediately we had a great time
31:34 blah blah blah okay but those who took
31:36 care of on a daily basis said man she
31:38 didn't know where she was half the time
31:39 short-term memory okay so Bob bounces
31:43 through now according to Bob and this
31:45 george knapp he does investigations on
31:47 him he bounces through I guess you had
31:51 to be evaluated area 51 and then you get
31:53 pulled into s4 I don't think that there
31:55 were any tasks that Bob talked about at
31:57 area 51 that really mattered to him
32:01 other than maybe test-flying some of
32:02 these things which means they have to
32:03 open those gates up fly the ship out get
32:07 it over to s4 somehow quietly and then
32:10 just using the controlled airspace
32:12 they're flying it up and down and moving
32:14 it around the the reason why they
32:21 procure this guys that recently he said
32:24 this is a new twist I'd never heard in
32:27 the past that they mothballed the
32:28 project every 10 years so they put all
32:30 these vehicles away wait for technology
32:33 to grow up a little bit wait till mines
32:35 grew up a little bit I mean the man can
32:37 you imagine in the middle of this
32:38 horrible vacuum of Education you're
32:40 waiting for anyone to get smarter she's
32:42 at the mothballs thing for a thousand
32:44 years the current rate we're going right
32:46 but back in Bob's day education was good
32:50 so he supposedly spins if he's a okay so
32:56 normal normal time period don't forget
32:59 the Pierce junior college he goes to so
33:02 we got to add that on to the add that on
33:06 to the credit system that he's going for
33:08 and I don't think MIT or Caltech is
33:09 gonna recognize Pierce junior college
33:11 credits so if he spent two years in that
33:13 I don't know how many years they said
33:15 they don't say
33:17 you got to add that in so let's say
33:20 Pierce junior college never happen which
33:22 we actually have proof that that
33:23 happened okay maybe did in junior high
33:26 high school who knows you got seven-year
33:28 track if you don't get out early you
33:31 have a seven year track to get a
33:33 four-year degree in a three year degree
33:35 alright so he's in this program for a
33:38 very short period of time meanwhile his
33:41 whereabouts are pretty well accounted
33:45 for because he's building these turbine
33:47 jet vehicles so that pretty much when
33:52 you film him at some event with the
33:53 turbine jet vehicle well he's got to
33:55 have time to build the damn thing and
33:56 he's got to have time to drag it out
33:59 whereas he got all this time to go get a
34:00 degree let alone two at the two most
34:03 formidable scientific colleges in the
34:04 world I'm just saying
34:06 [ __ ] explained it to me man we're
34:08 sitting around hey Bob sitting right
34:10 there I give him this much crap and say
34:12 look dude if you're legit then we're
34:15 just not looking in the right places and
34:17 you've been looking in the wrong place
34:18 for 30 plus years George and a person in
34:21 front of me I'd say look man how do you
34:23 account for all this missing time and
34:25 why aren't you able to apply basic logic
34:27 to this you're an investigative
34:28 reporters is your job to have this kind
34:30 of mind right so we sort of have him at
34:34 home
34:34 Hilton these things he's famous for it
34:37 got lots of footage of him with all of
34:39 his cool inventions again the guy is
34:41 smart okay probably certifiably a genius
34:45 in the areas of that he has talked about
34:49 this information whether he fictional II
34:51 made it up I mean Robert Heinlein made
34:52 up Robert Heinlein theorized the nuclear
34:57 bomb before it ever had take that ever
34:59 been blown up and supposedly the
35:02 government came to him and said how do
35:04 you know about this because the
35:06 Manhattan Project was a complete covert
35:09 project we know what occurred because
35:13 the bunch of people that worked for the
35:14 place 10,000 employees or something like
35:15 that they've all given their testimonies
35:18 all these women and men they all you
35:19 know that really did exist but they
35:22 arrested Heinlein sort of detained him I
35:24 should say to ask him how the hell did
35:26 you know this so it's brilliant people
35:29 out there that could think up things
35:30 that
35:31 might be true may not be true who knows
35:32 right it's good entertainment if nothing
35:35 else right he says he goes through this
35:37 apparatus and being there is actually a
35:39 very difficult process it's not like all
35:42 fun and games according to him which is
35:43 very interesting but it also provides
35:46 constraints on his storytelling if he
35:49 ever gets cornered on a detail he can
35:50 just simply say I didn't have that
35:51 information well you would think he'd be
35:54 fairly compartmentalized so that's not
35:55 also not hard to believe but again I've
35:59 heard him say with his voice the camera
36:01 at his face that he was led into this
36:03 facility the very first time and again I
36:07 never heard him explain how the doors
36:08 work to s4 until recently in this
36:10 documentary I'm glad he said something
36:12 because I was like how does how do the
36:14 satellite photos miss this you know not
36:18 that that you know the map people would
36:19 not help conceal it he says he's led
36:22 into this this warehouse in the side of
36:26 a mountain and I think the first time he
36:29 said it he said he literally had the
36:31 ropes that you would have like a movie
36:32 theater and a carpet that went straight
36:35 up to it and he's walking up to it and
36:38 he's literally he tried to look sideways
36:40 at the other eight vehicles which can he
36:45 described as damaged initially didn't
36:48 say anything about that as documentary
36:49 he walks up to this vehicle and again
36:51 there is no explanation for how they got
36:56 the door open how you climb in the thing
36:58 how do you go from the middle chamber to
37:00 the bottom chamber where these
37:01 antimatter engines are those are a
37:04 little you know doorbell on the outside
37:06 I mean no explanation of them if you've
37:08 heard that you've heard more than I've
37:09 ever heard and I've watched probably
37:11 without question eight hours of this
37:13 guy's interviews and presentations and
37:16 people following up on those
37:18 presentations right well I want to
37:21 clarify too I mentioned the dr. Stanton
37:24 Friedman I've been saying Stanton
37:26 thinking it was his last name I forgot
37:28 that his last name was Friedman so it's
37:29 actually dr. Friedman that I talked
37:32 about who was who died wanting to
37:36 believe Bob but not believing Bob
37:38 totally and again Stanton Friedman for
37:41 me is probably one of the most
37:43 rock-solid UFO
37:45 in the in history he was really cool he
37:50 really kept everything low-key his
37:52 optimism was always governed which is
37:56 good so Bob again without describing how
38:00 he gets in this vehicle obviously the
38:03 insert assertion would be that someone
38:05 else had figured out how to open the
38:07 thing up that maybe if you capture it
38:09 the aliens open the door and there's
38:10 like hey don't shut that door you know
38:12 put something in there and they will
38:13 keep the door open as if the superior
38:15 technology would be unable to circumvent
38:21 any methodology we would use to control
38:23 it right I mean if it's super duper
38:24 powerful you put like an eye beam in
38:26 there and it just crushes it you know I
38:27 don't know who knows right apparently
38:30 according to the Roswell crash you have
38:34 some fragility in the vehicles so what
38:38 is the science behind this vehicle
38:39 according to Bob Lazar well he says
38:42 there's three hanging antimatter engines
38:45 in the lower section arranged in a
38:48 perfect triangle which makes I guess
38:51 geometric sense these hanging sort of
38:57 cylindrical pods have antimatter engines
39:00 inside them of which Bob has never
39:03 claimed to understand how they work and
39:05 he said that's truly the big mystery is
39:08 to how this next thing I'm about to talk
39:11 about which is this element 115 would
39:14 influence these hanging antimatter
39:17 engines right what I don't understand is
39:19 is the following I mean unless you
39:23 literally have the alien there talking
39:25 to you and somehow and syncing your your
39:29 descriptions of hey I speak alien and
39:31 you speak English and we're using tell
39:33 telepathy to communicate somehow they're
39:35 able to discern the phrase antimatter
39:39 I'm skeptical that an alien would come
39:41 up with the exact same description of
39:44 matter in that realm maybe man listen to
39:47 it went oh you know what he's talking
39:48 about he's talking about blue paint you
39:49 know so without opening these pods and
39:52 looking inside of them which would be
39:54 the first thing you'd want to do is
39:55 dismantle one you know sorry remove one
39:57 of these hanging
39:58 from the vehicle which means you'd have
40:00 all the assembly mechanisms to take it
40:02 apart which I don't think he ever
40:04 claimed that they did you'd have to take
40:06 the cover off and you'd have to look
40:07 inside and see what's inside there in
40:10 the center of the second floor you have
40:13 this half dome and any of the under the
40:16 half dome which is a very important
40:18 shape according to Bob you have this
40:21 little slice of conical vertically
40:26 sliced 115 now what's interesting about
40:31 this is that two Bob's credit 115 didn't
40:36 exist in the in the physical realm when
40:41 Bob broke this story in the late 90s
40:42 earlier ladies early nineties excuse me
40:45 since then in 2003 they were able to
40:48 synthesize a little tiny bit of this
40:51 stuff but according to Bob and his
40:54 journey through this product project
40:58 excuse me they said that they had
41:00 manufactured or been given acquired 500
41:04 pounds of 115 115 as bob has described
41:10 it because he's the only one that really
41:12 gives it any mystery is that it is a
41:16 very difficult element to create because
41:22 of its it's sort of like saying if you
41:26 were to balance a rock on the tip of a
41:30 needle you have to get it just perfect
41:33 for that to ever occur you know it's
41:35 possible as long as the needle can hold
41:37 up the rock you can make it actually
41:39 happen but you have to find out of a
41:40 random object you have to find its
41:42 perfect center point and get it to work
41:43 right 115 on an atomic level is supposed
41:47 to be so difficult to stabilize that it
41:50 wants to be 113 114 or 116 118 is
41:55 supposed to want to move around once you
41:57 get it you have one of the most stable
42:00 supernatural elements that's ever
42:02 existed now all of the elements in the
42:07 tin the periodic table of chemistry is
42:10 based on its atomic
42:12 count and so synthesizing 115 in
42:16 microscopic subatomic levels or atomic
42:20 levels I should say like he said he goes
42:23 look you can create one or two atoms of
42:25 this stuff that doesn't constitute what
42:28 he was playing with he was playing with
42:30 billions of atoms of this stuff it's
42:32 left us that he could hold it right
42:34 according to Bob and it's sort of a
42:37 little sketchy but you put a little bit
42:41 of electricity through this thing and it
42:43 starts to create sort of a river of
42:46 ether all energy which is what
42:50 everything's made out of sorry Bob but
42:53 it goes in an arc arch throughout the
42:58 body of this vehicle and goes down into
43:00 those antimatter engines and it
43:02 essentially creates a it would be like
43:06 you've got some still water at the top
43:09 of a hill and the waterfall that's going
43:12 to go down into a super slide and spin
43:14 it around and move around it shouldn't
43:15 have enough energy to do that but with
43:17 115 you get this amazing release sort of
43:23 symmetry with the universe in that it
43:26 creates a pole once you create a pole of
43:30 ether old matter you get what he calls a
43:34 gravity wave because it's going to
43:36 affect what we call gravity which is the
43:38 collision with ether right for those of
43:41 you are still hanging on to pull gravity
43:43 and the phenomenon of gravity go see my
43:45 episodes on gravity go see my episode
43:47 called my ether journey all my ether
43:50 episodes so get up-to-date as to how the
43:52 universe really works and then what Bob
43:54 is telling you will even be more amazing
43:59 but these hanging pods then according to
44:03 Bob the ship actually flies with its
44:05 belly towards wherever it's going but
44:08 they also can swing at a 45 degree angle
44:11 and create the the waves to either side
44:14 of the vehicle which is why you actually
44:15 can have the left and right movement not
44:18 the most powerful configuration because
44:19 when they go left and right you don't
44:22 get this
44:24 sort of
44:25 the analogy might be crossing the beams
44:27 as the Ghostbusters would say you get a
44:30 harmonic amplification when all three of
44:34 them can go together when they can cross
44:36 their beams and take their lesser waves
44:38 compound compound them you get one big
44:41 wave out of the bottom of the ship's
44:43 you're creating this gravity well where
44:45 there's no ether in this bubble either
44:48 to the side or below now how they talk
44:52 about it being able to go up just
44:55 straight up I don't get how that works I
44:57 don't think his designs actually work
44:59 that way because you can't start pumping
45:02 an ether all you know or I should say
45:05 we'll see use his term gravity void
45:08 straight up through the compartment
45:10 where these aliens are supposedly
45:12 sitting in these three seats without
45:14 killing people above because you're made
45:16 either you can't have something mess
45:17 with your supply of what you're made out
45:19 of right so I never heard of any
45:23 explanation as to how that works that's
45:26 just sort of been left out of the puzzle
45:27 so left right and down works great now
45:30 if you can rotate the vehicle up and
45:32 then just go with the bottom towards
45:35 whatever star you're going to or planet
45:37 that makes complete sense based on his
45:39 theory now the and I modeled my UFO in
45:44 the intro after his model I took some of
45:47 the curve out of the belly of it as I
45:49 thought look better that way but the top
45:52 appears to have what most people confuse
45:55 and this is according to Bob which I
45:57 thought was great confused as Windows
46:00 but they're actually sensors to tell the
46:03 vehicle where it is in the star map of
46:06 the universe which is interesting so B
46:08 what's strange about it is is that he
46:10 says it travels with its belly towards
46:12 wherever it's going but the sensors are
46:15 on the other side of the vehicle
46:16 pointing at the star map the other way
46:18 so you'd have to have technology that
46:19 would drive you away from what you're
46:21 trying to get to it's just bizarre right
46:25 so I don't sure he's quite thought all
46:26 this this design out now since his
46:31 initial
46:34 a reveal of this 115 and this is what I
46:40 would understand
46:41 so this documentary was probably made
46:43 you know it takes a while to shoot of
46:45 documentary maybe 2017 and then you know
46:49 some in 2018 edit it throw it out the
46:51 door and now he's been all over the
46:52 place and again when you search on
46:53 videos of Bob Lazar you find 98% the
46:57 documentary and you can barely get back
46:59 to his old lectures the documentary
47:02 filmmaker whose name escapes me it's the
47:05 sort of the tattooed bearded hipster guy
47:08 he does his big drama during the
47:11 documentary where he's doing you know
47:13 speaker phone calls at his the school
47:16 house he's staying at and he says I have
47:18 called all these physicists around the
47:20 world about 115 and they said that this
47:25 is impossible to make and blah blah blah
47:27 okay well I went on a big 115 journey at
47:31 my smoke lounge all of us sitting in the
47:32 room we're looking at videos all about
47:34 1:15 and 2003 they synthesized it since
47:40 then they've made it over and over and
47:43 over again through different techniques
47:44 so by the time this documentary was made
47:48 the phone call that he said he made in
47:50 all these physicists he talked to you
47:51 would have said yeah we're making it
47:53 we're making it right now we may not
47:54 have five hundred pounds of this stuff
47:55 but we make it it's not a it's not
47:58 theoretical element anymore it really
48:00 exists so how the hell did they get the
48:03 science off in the documentary oh
48:05 because it's mysterious and a
48:08 documentary has angles right so where
48:11 does this thing end initially in the 90s
48:13 for Bob Lazar well I've heard him talk
48:16 about this four or five times and he
48:18 never mentions the names of people that
48:21 were there but but John Lear son of the
48:24 learjet family one of more than one son
48:27 who believes that every single bump on
48:29 the moon is a Space Station by the way I
48:31 mean you kept all this are I swear to
48:35 God if you took a picture of a kid with
48:36 bad acne and colored it black and white
48:39 and gave it to John Larry he'd think it
48:41 was the moon he'd show you where all the
48:42 moon bases word it's like nah it's just
48:44 my kids face but he takes John Lear out
48:47 there
48:48 his wife up on a hill in the groom
48:52 Valley area overlooking the base on a
48:55 particular day because he was given the
48:57 test flight schedule and they are seeing
49:01 things and they're filming things lit
49:03 things well there's all kinds of wild
49:05 drone technology being developed at Los
49:07 Alamos labs there's been Declassified
49:09 you can see it these drones fly at
49:12 amazing breakneck speeds man just right
49:15 angle turns I mean it's phenomenal what
49:17 they've been able to do so he's showing
49:21 it to them he said he missed he missed
49:25 personally one of the biggest maneuvers
49:26 that happened because he looked a way to
49:28 get his camera the camel guys show up
49:31 you know the guys that take care of 51
49:33 security and they are really pissed off
49:36 that he's there that he's brought
49:37 pedestrians with them non-military
49:39 individuals they all get arrested but
49:42 then they're rested in the military and
49:44 then they all kind of let go because
49:46 Lear's famous Bob Lazar is part of this
49:49 program and just as a favor they don't
49:51 arrest his wife the way the story goes
49:54 is that you know and you have to
49:58 understand meanwhile he's running a
49:59 brothel at the same time he because like
50:01 right after this whole thing breaks open
50:04 he gets busted for this brothel thing
50:06 and you know technically speaking
50:08 imagine them throwing the brothel thing
50:10 on him to make his life hell and he had
50:12 nothing to do with it but he knows he
50:14 can't fight the system so he agrees that
50:17 he did run it he didn't run it and he
50:19 does this under 50 days community
50:21 service which doesn't seem like the
50:23 proper conviction for such a crime he's
50:27 a felon so they erased his ability to
50:29 vote to have a gun all that kind of
50:31 stuff it could be a could be a sting
50:34 operation on him not really a sting but
50:36 a frame job excuse me so Bob is then
50:41 told that his this is a bit personal but
50:45 it was out there that his wife was
50:47 cheating on him basically like you want
50:50 to hurt us we're gonna hurt you boom
50:54 John Lear has taken massive interviews
50:56 at his house with the hell's that
51:00 organization I forgot the name of it
51:01 it's a other UFO organization which does
51:04 a lot of interviews I apologize for not
51:06 remembering the name of it but anyway
51:07 they interview him and he talks a lot
51:09 about Bob's whole journey and Bob had
51:12 kind of gone into hiding at the time he
51:15 really wasn't hiding he's doing his
51:16 United nuclear thing wherever he lives
51:21 bob says you know bob describes a bunch
51:24 of stuff that we already talked about he
51:25 does confirm that they were the ones
51:26 watching this together just the three of
51:28 them I think he was the one that
51:30 revealed the the wife cheating thing not
51:34 his current wife okay
51:35 I think they're married the one that's
51:39 in the documentary again if the any of
51:42 this is wrong it just comes off the the
51:45 interviews about this guy one of the
51:48 interesting things that John Lear talked
51:51 about was because the big question for
51:53 Bob was did you ever see an alien
51:57 because that would amp up the story
51:59 you're gonna lie about a new thing if
52:01 you're lying about this whole thing's
52:02 let's see where you go with this
52:04 according to John Lear he said that it
52:06 one day he was walking down the corridor
52:10 for point A to point B he's not supposed
52:12 to be looking left and right ever
52:14 you're compartmentalize completely down
52:16 to your your physical journey between
52:19 point A and point B and that he looked
52:21 into a window which had that security
52:24 glass you know with the barbed you know
52:26 crosshatch wires in it he said that he
52:29 saw two guys this is this is second
52:32 person I think Bob actually recently was
52:35 asked this on either Joe Rogan or
52:39 somewhere else I saw a recent interview
52:40 with him but they he said he said I saw
52:43 two guys in a white coats like lab coats
52:45 with a being that looked like a great
52:50 alien sort of creature but it wasn't
52:53 moving and it seemed to be almost posed
52:56 in that would anyone believe this so he
53:00 thought okay maybe they're just
53:01 designing beings that might fit in the
53:04 vehicle seems like a stretch that
53:07 be sitting there going okay let's give
53:09 them almond eyes and little fingers like
53:10 why the hell would you care a little
53:13 person it's a little being that fits
53:15 inside this really tight space on the
53:17 second floor the primary floor of the
53:19 vehicle itself okay so he doesn't jump
53:23 off on that which is probably good for
53:25 him but Bob talked about that the more
53:29 that the story kept going and going it's
53:31 sort of the one thing that I thought
53:33 evolved in the story meaning he didn't
53:35 say it initially but it became a
53:36 cornerstone of future interviews 10 15
53:39 20 years after the fact based on the
53:42 year 1990 was that he was brutalized
53:49 psychologically and the way that they
53:52 describe it is that where he describes
53:54 it was that they would hit him in the
53:57 back hit him in the chest with a like an
54:00 m16 while other people were in the room
54:03 Fr sorry excuse me I'm missing one step
54:05 they gave him an injection which sort of
54:07 affected his neural state could be a
54:10 truth serum could be something else like
54:12 that but they're hitting him in the
54:14 chest and telling him that he never saw
54:16 anything they never did anything he was
54:18 never here just trying to erase his
54:20 memory through this sort of trauma
54:23 MKULTRA mechanism right being attacked
54:26 physically is never a normal event
54:28 unless you've grown up in that world of
54:31 some abusive environment where someone
54:33 hitting easily you know whatever I'm a
54:35 boxer hitting me is lo big deal I'm not
54:37 losing my mind because you hit me but in
54:39 him 16 but in the chest would definitely
54:41 one leave a mark and to wake your ass up
54:45 and so he said this was a therapy that
54:48 happened to him every single day that he
54:50 went there which is why he started grew
54:55 disgruntle with the whole process
54:57 because for him according to his own
54:59 words I'm paraphrasing he didn't he
55:04 didn't feel the need you know I mean he
55:07 shared with his wife and John Lear but
55:09 he didn't feel the need to run out and
55:10 tell the world like he did eventually
55:12 after supposedly being cut from the
55:13 program but after he's caught he does
55:17 get kicked out of the program
55:18 sort of one of these things that there
55:21 has to be a repercussion this is how I
55:23 interpret it there has to be a
55:25 repercussion for bringing your friends
55:26 out there you have to lose your
55:27 privilege pass to appreciate your pass
55:30 it's not clear whether or not they
55:32 wanted to completely click kick him out
55:34 of the program or if they had a simply
55:36 thought they get exhausted all his
55:38 research capabilities he wasn't going
55:39 anywhere at the project I don't know he
55:42 never talks about that part of it now
55:46 the interesting thing with Bob is that
55:47 he can claim at any point in time that
55:49 he is stepping on the security clearance
55:54 of the project meaning if someone
55:57 corners them like me hey tell me how you
56:00 got in the vehicle tell me you know
56:03 besides looking at things just without
56:06 touching anything
56:07 did you ever open up an antimatter
56:09 engine did you ever get one removed how
56:11 did you guys do that what tools do you
56:13 use tell me more details about the
56:15 inside of this thing besides this little
56:17 story about 115 the story about 115 is
56:20 the kind of stuff that physicists make
56:22 up for their PhD thesis to get their PhD
56:26 you know well if we could do this maybe
56:28 we could do this and that would be great
56:30 and here's we can make spaceships and
56:32 anti-gravity with this element but it's
56:35 all just academia it's not reality so
56:38 the only difference is you take it into
56:40 reality by making a claim then everybody
56:43 wants to believe in this which there are
56:44 tens of millions of us that are
56:46 extremely interested in the UFO story
56:49 again I should say none of the
56:54 skepticism I have for Bob Lazar affects
56:57 my personal belief of Roswell then again
57:01 I went in trying to disprove Roswell I
57:03 was so eager you have to understand man
57:07 I was so eager when I started my
57:09 research on Roswell I I was like I'm
57:11 gonna stuff this story up everybody's
57:13 but I'm gonna prove through sheer logic
57:16 that Roswell never happened and I found
57:18 myself utterly incapable of shaking the
57:23 story every one of the I - I was test
57:26 eyewitness testimonies people who were
57:28 either wife's or best friends of the
57:30 people that saw stuff as a second tear
57:31 down
57:32 all their stories were very legit you
57:35 know old lady's crying on camera that
57:37 weren't selling a book or a t-shirt
57:39 didn't have a convenience store with an
57:41 alien on the front just terrified of
57:44 what they saw either personally or what
57:47 happened to their friends so now Bob
57:50 works for his United nuclear company he
57:55 has been busted a couple times or at
57:57 least one big time that took three years
57:58 to resolve between 2003 2006 he got
58:01 busted for bringing in some propellant
58:05 for his fireworks that he's not supposed
58:11 to have in the United States so he got
58:12 busted for that you know what I don't
58:18 understand is 2003 is two years after
58:22 that day in 2001 where bad people were
58:28 thought to exist and not the government
58:30 doing it to us right so bringing in an
58:34 explosive that's not supposed to be here
58:37 in the United States seems like a
58:39 stretch that he would be able to get
58:43 free from it that's what I'm trying to
58:44 say I'd be like oh my god you know
58:46 you're bringing in stuff that could be
58:47 used to do some serious mass damage you
58:50 know I don't know I don't know I don't
58:52 know what the substance was but he got
58:54 busted and he they paid a seventy five
58:56 hundred dollar fine or something like
58:57 that John Lear in one of his interviews
59:03 he said that bob was back in the project
59:08 because he had disappeared out of John
59:10 Lear's circle of communication according
59:13 to the documentary that has never
59:15 occurred he's never gone back into the
59:16 program well if you weren't in the
59:18 program to begin with and never going
59:20 back in seems like a logical logical
59:24 place you'd be you never been there no
59:27 you're not going to invite it back into
59:29 place you've never been so that's an
59:33 hour of the recap my immediate concerns
59:36 about his story but now let's go to the
59:41 next tier of what could have occurred
59:46 it's on one level it's a bit of a
59:49 stretch those of you who are super Bob
59:51 loyalists I understand how this might
59:53 rub you the wrong way but listen to me
59:54 for a second because you have to
59:56 understand I'm a fan of Bob myself if
59:58 nothing else I'm a fan of the story the
60:02 115 story I think that's brilliant the
60:04 antimatter engine thing it's brilliant I
60:06 mean it's brilliant fiction if it's fake
60:09 so well let me throw this out there to
60:12 begin with because it's a real short
60:14 sentence of what this could possibly be
60:17 now according to Bob as a Joe Rogan
60:22 interview he said that two things that
60:25 were interesting I didn't see him say
60:27 the second thing I'm about to say but I
60:28 saw him say the first thing he said that
60:31 when the question came up as to where
60:33 they got all of these vehicles and he
60:35 said every single one almost different
60:36 which man that begs a question is it
60:39 nine different civilizations is it like
60:41 you knew him over the course of the
60:44 years that they built this vehicle and
60:46 the fenders change and the headlights
60:47 change and the interior changes and the
60:49 logo changes just like some you know
60:51 Plymouth Fury or something some Chevy
60:54 Ageing over the years
60:56 it's weird but he claimed that one of
60:59 the rumors that was going around his
61:00 friends and you know so here's the other
61:02 question like how do you talk to your
61:03 friends in a world where you're not able
61:04 to look left and right you're not
61:05 supposed to be talking to your friends
61:07 well friends do you have were they right
61:10 I should say too there was a guy who did
61:13 the background check on Bob that was
61:14 supposedly located during the
61:16 documentary and he said yeah I did the
61:18 background check on Bob Lazar that's a
61:21 fairly decent piece of little evidence
61:23 there I don't want to miss some of these
61:25 key points but he said that these
61:27 vehicles were rumored to have been
61:29 discovered in an archaeological dig
61:32 that's cool
61:35 I don't know how all those sort of digs
61:37 would be missed
61:39 you know by pedestrians today you
61:41 realize if anybody finds something like
61:43 that today everyone has two phones with
61:46 them I mean two cameras on one phone you
61:49 snap at the shot you put it up on social
61:50 media
61:51 yeah they got methods of of wiping that
61:54 stuff clean but I mean we have darknet
61:55 we have all kinds of people download to
61:57 their hard drives put them on RAM
61:59 it would be nearly impossible to get rid
62:01 of a photo that was legit today so I
62:04 guess they're lucky they got all these
62:06 things a long time ago then I read I
62:10 think in his wikipedia or something that
62:13 he claimed that supposedly mankind has
62:16 had a relationship with these aliens for
62:19 more than 10,000 years all right we can
62:25 barely track 7,000 years ago let alone
62:28 ten so I be interesting to find out you
62:31 know generally where that theory would
62:35 land again just rumor on top of rumor
62:38 but now this is a military thing this is
62:44 what's always rubbed me wrong about the
62:45 entire story and one of the reasons why
62:48 I was initially skeptical of any story
62:50 of any UFO anywhere in history including
62:53 Roswell according to current day 2019
62:59 august disclosures Russia China all of
63:07 Europe England India Australia all these
63:13 other countries have never captured a
63:17 UFO there are no rumors I am aware of
63:20 and enlighten me if you know I don't
63:23 mean to be an idiot but I've never heard
63:24 Russia say oh yeah we've got UFOs - oh
63:27 and by the way here's a picture of one
63:29 Russia seems to be coming clean on
63:31 everything they've ever seen so if if
63:35 this was a PSYOP you got two different
63:39 scenarios at least that could be true
63:42 bob is one of them they forged this
63:45 story he's really good at it the guy who
63:47 gives the maybe they teach Bob how to
63:49 get through a lie-detector test which is
63:52 not likely you know would have to be
63:54 that that guy was in on it as well which
63:56 there's no indication that he is the
64:00 Bob's holding on to this whole thing to
64:02 make it look like to the rest of the
64:05 world not only is America completely
64:07 formidable with its amazing military not
64:11 too
64:13 minimize any other military okay but we
64:16 got alien [ __ ] we got alien stuff when
64:18 we've been yanking all kinds of fiber
64:20 optics and you know microchips out of
64:23 the technology velcro which is a really
64:25 funny thing because it occurs naturally
64:27 in flowers but isn't that a nice
64:31 psychological weapon for our enemies we
64:34 got alien stuff you can't do anything
64:36 about it or Bob is harvests from some
64:44 meeting somewhere they do put him in a
64:46 program but it's 99% chemicals being
64:51 injected in him gun butts jammed in his
64:54 chest and through almost but maybe they
64:58 even build a prop for him maybe they're
65:01 just using technology they know he's
65:02 never seen so to him it's alien and they
65:06 inject in his mind a completely truthful
65:08 story that he worked on a UFO but it's
65:11 all crap now the lights he sees in the
65:14 sky their drone technology you know
65:17 again drones are something you could buy
65:19 today but again I've seen videos online
65:22 of a warehouse with these amazing like
65:26 spitting drones that are working on
65:27 using propulsion systems I've never seen
65:30 before little bitty little engines who
65:34 knows maybe you know and a light in the
65:36 sky can be really tiny but seeing
65:38 gigantic you know maybe they've found a
65:41 way they're like hey man we got this
65:43 alien invasion plan but we don't quite
65:44 have it up there but what we could do is
65:46 trick one or two people into thinking
65:48 this stuff is real if we just
65:50 orchestrate it correctly so Bob is
65:52 getting programmed with an illusion he
65:55 believes it's real like you know is that
65:57 bill Cooper said that you know he saw
66:00 what he saw off the side of a ship in
66:02 this late 60s like 67 he said he saw
66:05 spaceships leave the ocean and then come
66:07 down into the ocean and he said that was
66:09 real everything else I saw after that
66:11 might have been faked who knows but we
66:18 have to accept the fact that maybe Bob
66:20 was conditioned to believe this stuff
66:24 MKULTRA is real
66:26 they paid reparations to some of the
66:28 people that were harmed by the project
66:30 this this secret clandestine project to
66:33 create men cheering candidates that will
66:35 go berserk and shoot people but what if
66:39 you didn't make him a violent person you
66:41 just used the technology to inject
66:43 fiction you make him think he got his
66:46 degrees at Harvard and Caltech but he
66:48 has no proof that he ever went there not
66:50 even for himself you can't produce any
66:53 alumni that remembers him that's
66:56 impossible it's just impossible you know
67:01 in and I'll just give you you know it's
67:04 like nobody forgets me in high school
67:07 it's just high school man I mean when I
67:10 went to high school is three years
67:11 junior sophomore junior or senior right
67:14 I was a whiz kid at the computers I was
67:17 a whiz kid of physics and astronomy trig
67:20 geometry and geometry I was extremely
67:23 good at algebra bored the [ __ ] out of me
67:25 but whatever I touch to turn to gold it
67:28 was it was like they remember me because
67:30 I was the special kid they may not like
67:34 me I don't know but it was it's just the
67:40 fact that this guy would put me to shame
67:43 he would put me to shame in and the fact
67:46 that nobody remembers him I got a
67:48 problem with that the other thing is
67:50 that they pulled him out of thin air
67:51 recently hear the buzz on the internet
67:57 and all different realms a chain 4chan
68:00 all these other social media YouTube
68:02 channels is that there we've literally
68:06 been warned that the deep state will try
68:11 to fake this alien invasion thing so if
68:15 you were going to release let's just say
68:19 that the let's just say that the
68:21 sightings because everybody has a
68:23 cellphone now the sightings of UFOs are
68:25 actually at an all-time low now I've
68:27 read reports that it's completely
68:29 opposite but it's like okay people in
68:31 Africa have 4k phones now if everyone's
68:35 if the sightings are going up then where
68:37 is all the footage right it should be
68:40 better
68:40 than any footage we've ever seen the
68:42 only stuff I've seen is 3d art students
68:44 doing tracking 3d tracking shots like
68:46 that one I did pull on the UFO in the
68:48 backyard it's no big deal you can mask
68:51 out a a building so that the UFO goes
68:55 behind the building goes back and forth
68:56 and also their stuff it's it's just
68:58 trivial special effects that you can do
69:01 with a laptop all right and free
69:03 software called blender 3d ok but I've
69:08 been involved with enough public
69:10 relations situations that you know when
69:16 they release a movie I've been on two
69:20 different projects where I've been in
69:23 movie studios where we're talking about
69:25 how to create a campaign around a film
69:27 to raise the awareness of the subject
69:31 matter of the film whether it's
69:32 transhumanism or downloading your brain
69:37 to a computer or whatever to put out
69:40 articles by articles set up fake
69:42 websites to get the consciousness of man
69:47 up on these things including like fake
69:49 leaked videos of things like when Tron
69:52 Legacy came out there was a comic-con in
69:54 San Diego and the leaked trailer of Tron
69:58 Legacy was a Disney employee filming the
70:03 trailer inside comic-con and
70:05 intentionally filming it intentionally
70:07 leaking it out to the to the web
70:09 everybody rushed in because it was a
70:11 secret thing you weren't supposed to see
70:13 it was all set up
70:14 it was brilliant so if you want to make
70:18 a bunch of people believe that this
70:20 alien thing is actually going to occur
70:22 you do anything you can to push it in
70:25 the consciousness of man including
70:26 resurrecting Bob Lazar now maybe that
70:29 documentary happened completely
70:30 organically the guy that directed it
70:32 which I think he did a great job I mean
70:34 it was a great documentary so no I don't
70:37 have any any you know bad feelings
70:41 towards the head at all man I don't have
70:43 any bad feelings really towards Bob it's
70:45 just there's some explaining to do as
70:49 Desi Arnaz would put it the other thing
70:52 about
70:53 the documentary was that there's this
70:57 ongoing question that keeps going to Bob
71:00 and I didn't realize it but it went all
71:03 the way back to 92 early 90s let's put
71:06 that way like second or third interview
71:10 supposedly Bob admits to somebody maybe
71:14 George Knapp or somebody and this is
71:17 what's kind of hard to believe that he
71:19 snuck out with someone 15 now in the
71:24 documentary what was fantastic about his
71:26 description of the 115 is he talks about
71:28 how they layered a bunch of little disks
71:31 up and then they shaped it like a cone
71:33 they laid it like a cone and then they
71:36 slice it down to sides to create sort of
71:39 a slice of a cone and that's the proper
71:42 shape to then control the natural
71:45 polarity of 115 as it reacts to sort of
71:49 the piezo effect you take a crystal and
71:52 you harmonize like electrical waves
71:55 towards it and it will start exuding one
71:57 frequency so if 115 has a piezo effect
72:01 that's going on but according to Bob it
72:05 actually messes with ether all winds
72:07 thus creating gravity bubbles you know
72:10 gravity is ether pushing on things and
72:13 having negative pressure between things
72:15 then it makes sense it was brilliant and
72:18 I saw that I was like whoa Touche Bob
72:22 the Bob sat in the documentary and said
72:24 we don't know what gravity is okay so
72:29 you got a degree from MIT and a degree
72:31 from Caltech and you've never heard of
72:35 Tesla's lamenting about ether and that
72:39 it exists he proved it was 50 times the
72:41 speed of light all the way back to
72:43 Faraday saying the same exact thing eric
72:45 Dollard in the late 70s was able to
72:47 verify it again using a wire in the RCA
72:50 Navy
72:51 radar laboratories this guy has no
72:54 knowledge of that but he's got these two
72:56 degrees with G's that's how smart you
72:59 get going to those two institutions and
73:01 I'm glad I'm in my backyard so here's
73:04 what's weird for me
73:06 he's told people that he at least
73:10 somebody that he brought some 115 out of
73:12 this project one according to all of his
73:17 lamenting about how much he was
73:18 strip-searched and pounded in the chest
73:20 by guns I mean he would have to have one
73:26 taking the most coveted substance on
73:28 planet earth and what he shoves it up
73:31 his butt how does he get out of the
73:33 place I mean when you go to prison they
73:34 make you squat and cough right to see if
73:38 you got anything in your cavities your
73:39 vagina your anus whatever they figure it
73:42 out so I guess prisons the average jail
73:45 cell down the street before prison even
73:47 occurs has more security than this s4
73:49 place I don't know how did he get it out
73:51 of the system is it a really teeny tiny
73:53 bit don't know but he tells somebody
73:56 this very coveted thing I got some of
73:58 the 115 out of this place and that
74:01 person doesn't keep the secret that
74:03 person leaks it all over the place such
74:06 that an average reporter investigator or
74:08 whatever you want to call him journalist
74:10 asks him in an interview in the early
74:12 90s I heard you got someone 15 a place
74:14 and he you know you won't talk about it
74:16 okay
74:18 now because he was asked the same thing
74:22 during the documentary we'll get back to
74:24 the documentary one second but let's
74:25 look at the logistics of that claim and
74:28 in the documentary they have raided his
74:32 little shack that's part of his United
74:36 nuclear group and of course he's saying
74:40 look they're looking for the 115 but
74:43 this is 2017 2018 whenever they're
74:45 shooting this thing okay so let's do
74:49 some math 1990 takes 10 years to get up
74:52 to 2000 takes another 10 years to get to
74:54 2010 and oh seven more years 27 years I
74:59 assure you I assure you if the group
75:05 that takes care of these spaceships and
75:07 the secret bunker in s4 which is a
75:09 mountain secret bunker just like you
75:12 know dr. evil from you know
75:17 Austin Powers right they would have
75:21 descended on this guy
75:22 again that he was asked the question in
75:23 the early 90s they would have descended
75:26 on this guy in epic proportions if they
75:33 could not find this 115 but thought he
75:35 took it they would put him back in
75:38 custody and they would interrogate him
75:40 and threaten him with his wife's life
75:44 with his friend's life with his own life
75:46 with his whole future he just being the
75:48 brigade forever right I mean he would
75:50 disappear off planet Earth until he
75:52 coughed up this one 15 he said look your
75:53 whole life was over as of right now
75:56 until you show us this well 15 nosis
75:59 thing seems to have occurred and why
76:02 tell everybody the most coveted thing on
76:04 Planet identity if I took 115 that place
76:06 whoo I don't know who I would trust with
76:09 with telling that I'm sure would bubble
76:10 up out of you you need you'd have to
76:12 tell somebody maybe if you're one of
76:13 those kind of people Bob doesn't seem
76:15 like he's one of those kind of folks but
76:17 I guess he was but during the
76:20 documentary they have this weird place
76:22 in the center of the documentary where
76:23 he asked the filmmaker to go out into
76:26 the woods they gather up all the phones
76:29 and put him out there so the stupid
76:30 thing was they went to where they were
76:31 going to be and then took the phone
76:33 someplace else and buried them in a box
76:35 and you know would have to go way far
76:38 away from that location before the
76:39 military wouldn't be able to find it but
76:41 supposedly he they insinuate I'm putting
76:48 in what I think that they were trying to
76:49 say that he actually buried this 115
76:53 somewhere out there in the middle of
76:55 nowhere okay why you wouldn't film it
77:02 and then do that stunt
77:04 it blows me away you want us to believe
77:07 you got this coveted stuff
77:08 and then you could probably just take
77:10 some graphite and it spray-painted pink
77:13 or whatever and who the hell's gonna
77:14 know you know it's it's going to be some
77:19 little prop that makes everybody believe
77:20 they didn't go that far but they
77:24 supposedly gave a video testimony that's
77:26 also being hidden on
77:28 you know drives again if the military
77:30 thought this stuff existed and he
77:32 thought that the documentary guy knew
77:33 and the crew knew oh my god you go up to
77:36 one of those guys cameraman you just say
77:38 look how much you're worth what do you
77:40 mean how much you have in the bank oh we
77:42 already know you're worth nothing okay
77:44 how's this how's that cameraman job
77:46 working out for you not so much okay
77:48 here's what we're gonna do we're gonna
77:52 give you ten million in cash it's been
77:54 an hour you want it's not gonna be
77:56 reported to any SEC not gonna be
77:59 bothered by it it's just gonna exist in
78:00 your in this bank account there's a
78:01 black credit card you can use to consume
78:04 it and we're gonna make sure that you
78:07 never want for a job and if whatever job
78:09 you want we'll go find it for you you
78:12 ready to talk about where you buried
78:13 this stuff boom they got it there's a
78:17 million ways and that's not even a
78:19 threatening methodology right that's
78:20 they wouldn't even give the groom lake
78:22 family that on the copper mine that they
78:25 stole all the land from to make area 51
78:27 they wouldn't even pay them more than
78:29 four million dollars for the land so
78:31 they're probably gonna go the violent
78:32 route which is what they did to that
78:34 family now let me tell you if you guys
78:37 well you guys probably didn't see the
78:39 other show in kilcher radio i was able
78:44 to break a story about the groom lake
78:46 family I guess four years ago now on my
78:51 other show because the family I know one
78:54 of the proxy members of the family and
78:56 they told me that the courts had gagged
78:58 them from telling the press that all
78:59 their land the remaining land that they
79:01 had was going to be eminent domained
79:03 under the obama administration a lot of
79:06 that happened under his administration
79:07 they're gonna steal the land the land
79:09 was valued at at least 30 plus million
79:12 dollars that they were only going to be
79:13 given for and again the the US courts
79:17 the federal court said you can't tell
79:19 anybody were [ __ ] you great right but
79:22 now one part of bob lazar story
79:26 correlates with the groom family story
79:30 this is interesting i want to leave you
79:32 on it a little up note here to make sure
79:33 you don't think I'm some complete cynic
79:35 on everything the family said but over
79:39 the last
79:40 God 50 years the woman that told me this
79:44 was in her late 60s early 70s I didn't
79:50 know how old she was it spent quite a
79:52 bit of time with this woman over a
79:53 couple years she said that the family
79:56 would wake up in the middle of the night
79:58 with black suit people and military
80:02 people pointing guns at their faces so I
80:06 wake up in bed and there's an m16 right
80:09 at their face they did it to the
80:12 children they also did this little
80:17 maneuver they hit him in the chest with
80:19 the guns and told them what they are
80:24 supposed to do you know you're to get
80:26 out of here we're gonna kill you if you
80:29 don't leave
80:30 basically scaring them off their
80:32 property they also demolition demand OHS
80:36 the copper mine that this family was
80:37 using to earn a tremendous amount of
80:39 money not quite sure how that works
80:41 because I think copper strip mined which
80:43 means it's a big open cavern so I don't
80:45 know how you messed that up but
80:47 supposedly got blown up and and
80:50 eradicated so they couldn't make any
80:52 money off of it without spending more
80:54 money than the coppers worth to set it
80:57 back up again so I think that's very
81:00 interesting that that story was told to
81:03 me way before I ever heard Bob Lazar
81:05 tell the story about being hit in the
81:06 chest with a gun I think Bob also said
81:10 that he was the logistics of getting to
81:12 s4 was that he would fly to area 51 in a
81:16 blacked-out window
81:18 jet of some sort maybe a cargo jet don't
81:21 know and then he was then marched out of
81:25 the jet on a tarmac street to a bus that
81:28 also was blacked out and that the bus
81:29 would travel to s4 and he'd spend the
81:33 day there or whatever it seemed like he
81:35 said it was a daily thing that he would
81:37 come back the other route and then fly
81:39 to some other Air Force Base and then go
81:41 home I mean that rate you're traveling
81:44 for I would imagine a couple hours each
81:47 way two times a day so it's a very very
81:51 interesting story
81:53 to recap I've been a fan of Bob's for
81:57 ever ever since I saw it today I'm a
82:00 little more skeptical about the
82:02 logistics of his claims of having all
82:04 these degrees it doesn't surprise me at
82:07 all that if he did get those degrees
82:08 they were able to erase the records thus
82:10 the educational institutions and all the
82:12 places he formerly said he worked says
82:15 they have no record of him working there
82:18 it's a very legalese kind of statement
82:20 isn't it but again I got photographs of
82:25 the two and a half years I lived in
82:26 Massachusetts tons of them tons of them
82:30 supposedly no one pointed a 35
82:33 millimeter film camera at him the entire
82:35 time he was in Cambridge Massachusetts
82:37 going to college for either three or
82:39 four years I would think that you would
82:42 go to probably MIT first and Caltech
82:46 second for one reason and one reason
82:48 alone Caltech is better than MIT by a
82:51 margin both of them are phenomenal
82:54 schools but Caltech is Caltech is a
82:58 place where they utterly harvest the
83:01 students into these type of projects
83:03 sure MIT is is the same sort of thing
83:06 but in Massachusetts school systems are
83:10 when I was going to school there I mean
83:12 I flunked seventh grade because it was
83:13 so difficult and I had to make up a
83:16 class in eighth degree when I moved back
83:18 to my own state of Kansas but you know I
83:22 hurry I'm acing all the other classes
83:24 after that and not all of them put you
83:27 know ones I loved it was a plus or a a
83:31 but yeah so I would think that if you
83:34 started your 4-year degree at Caltech
83:37 you would go get your graduate degree
83:38 from the same exact school why do I move
83:40 across the country if you're already at
83:43 the best school in the world doesn't
83:45 make any sense
83:46 and again we have to come up with the
83:48 money to pay for his education the only
83:52 other way to go to school without paying
83:53 for education is this somehow your
83:55 academic record is so hot meaning
83:59 amazing and phenomenal that these
84:00 schools are going to put you through a
84:01 scholarship okay you mean to tell me
84:04 again proof
84:07 you have no paperwork of having gone
84:10 through a scholarship program wouldn't
84:12 that be the talk of the town don't don't
84:15 you have in your life some kids that
84:17 have gotten scholarships and it's a big
84:19 deal the kid is so smart they got a
84:22 scholarship I don't care if it's a
84:23 soccer scholarship or an academic
84:25 scholarship this guy wasn't a soccer
84:27 players that would have been his IQ I
84:29 think we have proof regardless of how
84:33 you want to spin this thing the Bob
84:36 Lazar is an extremely intelligent person
84:40 extremely intelligent so no one will
84:44 take that away from him that's his
84:46 that's his MO he's always been brilliant
84:50 and he's also a doer when you see him
84:56 show off a jet rocket engine vehicle for
85:02 entertainment for money again I don't
85:03 know how he does that and goes to
85:04 college at these two different locations
85:05 to the same exact time that's that's
85:08 impressive man really impressive he is
85:12 also in that gray zone of legalese right
85:15 if he truly created a brothel which he
85:19 pleaded guilty to did his time for one
85:21 450 days of community service
85:25 then he's sort of one of those guys
85:29 what's a common denominator of scam
85:31 artists they're one of those guys they
85:36 have lots of those little things in
85:37 their past my hometown some of the
85:40 richest guys ever go through my hometown
85:42 that were sort of fly-by-night people
85:44 meaning either they grew up there and
85:46 they were I was kind of quiet but they
85:48 always had tons of money there driving
85:49 the best cars the kids always had the
85:50 best cards they're going bankrupt every
85:52 year off some new LLC that they've
85:54 created their scam artist they ganged
85:56 the system we've had a few of those all
86:01 right so sometimes that's just a
86:03 methodology of these individuals don't
86:06 know I'm not accusing Bob of being you
86:09 know some dirty person or something like
86:13 that but it's it is interesting that he
86:15 he makes a decision where he's like this
86:17 is illegal I'm gonna do it
86:21 you know when you go to court they try
86:23 to attack your character if this guy
86:26 ever went to court fighting this issue
86:27 they just bring up those two cases of
86:29 the explosives and the brothel and he'd
86:34 be done before going into a prove you
86:36 lived in Massachusetts for three to four
86:38 years I commuted know it's like so I
86:43 hope you enjoyed this episode I wanted
86:45 to do a daytime episode for the first
86:47 episode of season five you're gonna run
86:50 back inside and work on the intro
86:51 editing that thing together
86:52 I've got again at least 12 night
86:55 episodes probably be a ten episode not
86:58 ten nine episodes in two day time
86:59 episodes I think I've lost three
87:01 episodes due to beautiful final cut
87:04 saying it imported movies checked them
87:07 pulled out my card check the video it's
87:09 in the computer and then the next day I
87:10 come back and it's missing so I don't
87:12 know thanks Apple if you haven't been to
87:18 deep thoughts radio.com it's been
87:19 spiffed up it looks good on mobile looks
87:21 good on your computer it's where you can
87:24 find all the episodes I recently made
87:27 some changes I finally bit the bullet
87:29 and unlisted all of the season 1
87:33 episodes from this particular channel
87:35 because they have a lot of copyright
87:36 issues the gun control episode was
87:38 banned worldwide if that ever gets
87:41 banned worldwide again in the new
87:44 channel i created for season 1 where
87:45 it's all remastered brand new intro
87:47 brand new icons actually season 2 has
87:53 got brand new icons but check out all
87:55 the pauses and also their junks clean
87:57 them all up balanced all the audio
87:58 levels definitely go to the website to
88:00 see season 1 the links at the top if you
88:02 just want to dive into the channel
88:03 itself
88:04 no one banned to me no one took those
88:06 down against my will
88:07 if you've embedded them around the world
88:09 or link them to your facebook page
88:11 they're still gonna work
88:13 they're just unlisted you can't find
88:14 them in the search [ __ ] shoot now has
88:17 one two and three as of this recording
88:22 season four is gonna maybe take a little
88:24 longer because they're all for 4k
88:26 episode so I'm gonna see if [ __ ] you
88:27 will accept a 4k video I don't think it
88:29 does I think it has a 1080p
88:33 that's the case I've got a post process
88:36 all the videos down from 4k into 1080p
88:38 and then upload them all that's gonna
88:41 take a year but the website has two
88:45 options for video both the YouTube and
88:47 the bit shoot hopefully a bit shoot
88:49 sticks around so it's actually a great
88:51 platform bright tea on turned out to be
88:54 a just a giant turd is absolutely
88:56 censored by design so I have no love for
89:00 that platform there's two options for
89:02 your audio basically your your mac in
89:06 your android are all taken care of so
89:08 you get the links up there there's two
89:09 social media sites
89:10 there's the twitter which i just post
89:13 the feeds to the videos i don't do much
89:16 tweeting but we have a lock facebook
89:19 group which is a great group of folks it
89:22 does I will say that we've had some
89:24 folks get perturbed about the content
89:27 that's up there all I gotta say is you
89:30 know get some sad for your butt cuz it's
89:33 a fun place to be man everyone's really
89:35 tolerant of each other besides a couple
89:37 naysayers there's a couple ways to
89:41 contribute to the channel financially so
89:44 we have patreon which a lot of folks use
89:47 we have PayPal which no one's ever used
89:49 a bunch of people ask for it I put it up
89:51 there no one ever uses it the attention
89:53 of raising money for the channel is to
89:56 bring on some other individuals you know
89:59 the fantasy would be to support myself
90:01 100% for the channel which I'm not
90:03 holding my breath but it would be nice
90:05 to have another enough revenue to get
90:07 folks to help me edit these things maybe
90:09 do a little bit of fun stuff on the side
90:12 again like I said there's the link for
90:15 the season one channel on YouTube which
90:17 is a different channel if you're
90:19 searching on anything deep thoughts
90:20 radio just search on DTR and then EP for
90:24 episode and then whatever keyword that
90:26 you want to search on but in the website
90:29 we have a search field now just search
90:31 on whatever turns you on
90:32 there's a bunch of categories there so
90:34 I've taken a first pass at categorizing
90:36 a lot of videos I'm going to be probably
90:41 introducing another category over the
90:42 next six months which is demonetised so
90:45 every time YouTube refuses to monetize
90:47 my videos and I mean they they D
90:49 monetize the weirdest stuff man it's
90:51 weird but I'm turning off the attempt to
90:54 make it monetized and then I'm putting
90:56 in parentheses at the end of the title
90:58 do you monetize so for those of you like
91:00 to read between the lines of what the
91:02 deep state doesn't want you to
91:03 understand look for demonetised I'll
91:06 make that a category on the website over
91:07 the next six months it's a very
91:09 meticulous process of me going through
91:11 450 episodes and looking at which ones
91:14 are demonetized then going to the
91:15 website and check in the checkbox to put
91:17 in that category so it'll take a while
91:20 but anyway hope you have a lot of fun
91:22 with season 5 I should be a good ride
91:26 till the next episode take care of
91:28 yourself and someone else and I'll see
91:29 you in the next deep thoughts over now
