00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentleman I realized two things the
00:35 other day one this is the very first
00:38 time in history of the show I don't have
00:40 a backlog of episodes yeah right cool
00:43 and two there was one show just the
00:46 other day where I forgot to welcome you
00:47 guys so you guys should welcome you
00:50 twice so I'm having dinner with a friend
00:54 and we're talking about you know just
00:59 all of the reactions from Americans that
01:02 we experienced it used to be you know
01:06 you would only experience the reactions
01:08 of people in your local neighborhood and
01:10 because of social media you get it all
01:12 over the place no way I got a new tattoo
01:15 today check this out I got I asked my
01:21 hair band you can see that it's mr. Sid
01:26 needs signature we want to get that for
01:29 years and I thought if I got it before
01:32 he passed he might think that's a little
01:33 strange because he didn't have any
01:35 tattoos so I waited till afterwards no
01:38 he has finally signed his last work but
01:41 I was talking about the episode of you
01:45 know intellectual hatred and my friend
01:48 was like well you know what it is she
01:52 said you know all these kids they're
01:53 just so coddled in this country today
01:56 that they have no perception of anything
01:58 and she said very specifically we're
02:02 going to embed a little bit of the
02:04 Iranian situation in here you know it's
02:08 not an hour's worth of that stuff unless
02:10 I really just wander around or recall
02:13 history or something like that which has
02:15 its value and maybe I'll do that episode
02:17 at a different time I just feel like
02:19 there's much better sources on that go
02:21 to red pill page it's the dudes just kid
02:25 you know with four current news the guy
02:27 is really great I don't agree with
02:28 everything he believes in and he seems
02:32 like he believes in the project Looking
02:33 Glass being some futuristic technology
02:35 or at least he knows how to get good
02:36 subscriptions by
02:38 egging that on and I celebrate him
02:40 hundred percent if you do go over to his
02:43 channel from this channel comment that
02:45 this channel sent you over that ways
02:48 helps bring some folks back this way my
02:50 friend she said you know the reason why
02:54 kids would buy that this general do that
02:58 they killed is a martyr is a good guy
03:02 which is all the left dis oppressed in
03:04 the world it's just trying to pump this
03:07 guy episode was like literally Captain
03:10 Kangaroo man passing out candy at a
03:12 parade man you know and there's some
03:15 kind of vacillating ones in the middle
03:17 they think that they're just so ignorant
03:21 to think that trumps gonna be like yeah
03:22 World War three and by the way there
03:24 wouldn't be any World War three because
03:26 I guarantee you ain't China or Russia
03:29 are gonna throw down for that country
03:31 need no one in that area like Iran
03:33 leadership right the Iranian people were
03:35 I think just as cool as anybody in the
03:39 world is from everything that I've seen
03:40 they're fighting every single day and
03:42 that general dude killed what 2600 of
03:44 them just recently in the last month
03:46 this guy's a barbarian but the reason
03:50 why some you know I don't know you're
03:53 preparing capri pants wearing you know
03:56 lot a kid soy boy can sit and blog it's
04:00 his favorite you know Starbucks is
04:04 because that kid has never ever in his
04:08 or her life ever lived in a world where
04:13 that kind of shit's going on you know
04:16 that general dude was a boogie man so
04:18 bad that I heard a report you know one
04:23 of the citizens said look when I was a
04:26 kid they used to say that that guy would
04:28 come and get me if I didn't behave like
04:32 whoa could you imagine there's someone
04:35 in your government that you're so afraid
04:37 of he's a boogeyman as a child damn
04:42 how many little kids who heard that line
04:45 - you know next day slept the first
04:48 night of sleep in their life so the
04:52 other reason I want to make this episode
04:53 is that I do come from an American
04:55 perspective and a very friend about it
04:58 I want to thank you guys I I can't even
05:01 tell you how much I love comments that
05:05 say I'm coming to you from Ireland I'm
05:08 coming to you from some other countries
05:10 UK Germany wherever you're coming from
05:13 and you contribute your personal
05:17 perspective of your ear because that's
05:18 what I don't have is I don't have a
05:20 really deep rooted you know especially
05:24 from someone who's maybe 30 or above and
05:26 I don't mean to discount any was younger
05:28 because some of you folks are geniuses -
05:30 so you're probably in that camp as well
05:32 but especially the older that you are
05:34 you've got like you know decades of
05:37 feeling and experience one about your
05:39 own country but then again sort of the
05:41 overall feeling towards America and
05:43 that's that that's literally the cream
05:47 on the top for a guy like me to hear
05:50 that sort of thing so if you're in a
05:52 foreign country and you bless me with
05:53 your time you know find a reason to
05:57 comment on one of these videos this
05:59 should be a pretty good video to give me
06:01 some perspective from your area but I do
06:03 get folks you know rarely but you know
06:07 and it's it's a just criticism and I
06:11 don't even care if you're not right
06:12 about things that you're assuming that
06:14 we're thinking if you think it
06:16 perceptions everything I used to tell
06:18 people that you know it's like it
06:20 doesn't matter if you think you're being
06:21 nice and everybody disagrees with you
06:23 they disagree whatever you're doing is
06:26 obviously rubbing them the wrong way
06:28 maybe you don't give a crap because you
06:30 think they need to grow up or maybe
06:33 you're trying to make alliances and you
06:34 just can't get it to work you know but I
06:37 thought that you know what I'm not
06:40 talking about our Constitution honoring
06:44 Americans I'm talking about the other
06:47 group the group that falls for
06:50 everything George Soros funds follows
06:52 for all these you know
06:55 racist Democrats who created this
06:58 fantasy moment in the seventies I'm
07:00 gonna say that a lot this season because
07:01 it's something I need you all to
07:03 remember and repeat no event in the
07:06 Democratic Party history happened in the
07:09 70s where they changed they woke up one
07:11 day and they bought ten million dollars
07:13 worth the press and said look we
07:15 realized we got it wrong bah blah blah
07:17 blah blah no what they figured out was
07:20 their party was disappearing and they
07:23 had angered so many people on all sides
07:27 of the fence man Martin Luther King used
07:30 to used to march down DC he was
07:33 surrounded by every race plenty of white
07:35 people right there going this needs to
07:37 end
07:38 and there were all Republicans all of
07:40 them and so they realized you know all
07:43 they care about is keeping their evil
07:44 regime going they're globalists you know
07:47 regime going and this country wasn't
07:49 founded with the Democratic Party that
07:51 happened in the 1800s the early 1800s
07:53 this this party created itself I believe
07:57 in the same decade think it was 1830s I
07:59 hope I have that right at the same time
08:03 the skullenbones came into this country
08:04 the same time that you know Andrew
08:07 Jackson the president Andrew Jackson was
08:09 fighting the bankers this was all a
08:12 cabal from the very very beginning super
08:14 racist again creators of the KKK
08:17 they fought slavery being abolished like
08:22 there's three measures that were passed
08:24 and I think two out of three all
08:26 Democrats voted against freeing the
08:28 slaves and the last one like two percent
08:30 managed to pull their head out of their
08:32 butt but then by 1959 they're still
08:35 voting against desegregation okay this
08:39 is about coddled Americans so what do I
08:43 mean by coddled well there's all kinds
08:49 of ways of approaching it and I think
08:50 every single decade the amenities of the
08:53 coddling of American sort of lost
08:58 children changes in increases it
09:02 compounds from the previous decades you
09:04 get to keep everything that you've got
09:06 in the same 90s and then you get to keep
09:08 everything in the
09:09 mm and they get to keep everything in
09:11 the teens now we're headed into the
09:13 2020s okay I knows what's gonna happen
09:17 here hopefully this process ends very
09:20 abruptly here in the next say five years
09:22 or so let's just go at monetary things
09:26 which isn't what's interesting about
09:29 this I'm gonna give you a monetary view
09:31 of how the amenities of these coddled
09:34 children increased and even though it
09:37 seems a little off base from say
09:40 something that's important it isn't
09:42 because it is setting in place
09:45 mechanisms in the mind remember I had
09:48 this I have an episode called
09:51 technologies of the mind and what it's
09:52 about is the globalists using
09:56 technologies of the mind belief systems
09:58 in indoctrination cursors in culture to
10:01 drive it straight into your your cornea
10:03 very right through your brain but what
10:07 I'm talking about what the materialism
10:09 will be relevant here soon in the 70s in
10:14 America it was just as basic as you
10:19 could have it you had a nice house or
10:22 you didn't yeah a nice car but you
10:24 didn't or maybe had one and not the
10:25 other the home was usually you know a
10:29 family room a kitchen and had your
10:32 bedrooms if he had a bigger house she'd
10:34 have a living room one of my favorite
10:38 houses we ever lived in I guess the
10:39 living room is kind of a joke in America
10:41 it's where you put the kitchen table
10:43 that no one ever eats had and the room
10:45 is usually kept immaculate and no one's
10:48 ever allowed to go in there touch
10:49 anything it really was silly but if you
10:53 had a television you only had one
10:54 usually if you had a telephone mmm maybe
10:59 you'd have one wired in a bedroom but
11:01 that was pretty rare in the 70s in the
11:04 Midwest at least maybe wasn't so much in
11:05 the coastal regions because I wasn't
11:08 living here at the time but everything
11:10 was like if you had a game system an
11:14 Atari 2600 or an television or a Cliquot
11:17 vision or something it sat in the front
11:19 room
11:19 and it was for the entire family with
11:23 that one TV if you had a stereo it was
11:26 that one stereo maybe you had a radio in
11:28 your bedroom but that's about it
11:30 households grew up with rules and Men
11:33 you know your ass was in in back inside
11:37 the house at a certain time especially
11:38 when it was dark outside your mom will
11:40 go on the doorstep and yell your name
11:42 when you had about 120 seconds to get
11:46 your ass in there otherwise she's gonna
11:47 send your dad out to get you and so we
11:50 just behaved when kids would approach
11:54 adults in the 70s you had respect even
11:57 if it wasn't your parent and you know
12:00 out of an entire town at about 12,000
12:02 where I grew up and I did move around a
12:04 little bit but you know even the radius
12:07 little kids still had respect for adults
12:10 and the reason why was that it was
12:13 pretty easy to follow the kid home and
12:15 tell the parent that they had done
12:17 something wrong and regardless if the
12:19 parent was rich or poor the poor wanted
12:25 to say well their attitude was sort of
12:28 like this I might be poor but I'm not
12:31 uncivilized and I'm not my kids are not
12:34 going to be uncivilized they are going
12:35 to respect you and so it was just a
12:39 really nice last decade of I think utter
12:43 perfection in this country now the
12:46 eighties were pretty damn good too which
12:49 is really where the game consoles thing
12:51 started the 80s were interesting it was
12:54 sort of a for me my perspectives a
12:58 little bit weird because it's where I
12:59 went through my transition from my you
13:02 know my grade school into my middle
13:04 school so I was awkward as a kid you
13:06 know what trying to find me what the
13:07 hell I'm gonna look like and and that
13:09 sort of thing I was also stuck in the
13:11 Midwest I was also very poor I was poor
13:14 in Massachusetts I was poor in a Midwest
13:16 I am but when I finally got back to my
13:19 hometown about 13 at least I have my
13:21 family around me so it was a different
13:24 different perspective but my little
13:26 hometown was that thing I just told you
13:28 times 10 you behaved because our town is
13:32 so tiny
13:33 that you you would be turned in
13:35 instantaneously it was so bad once I was
13:38 walking home with my cousin it was the
13:42 guy have since disowned he's just a
13:44 little bastard I swear to god he's just
13:45 he's just never ceased being an [ __ ]
13:47 but he threw a rock at a church window
13:50 inside of a door and I'm just like this
13:53 totally innocent kid I mean I was like
13:54 ridiculously innocent and I'm looking at
13:57 this whole thing he broke the window and
13:58 I'm staying out she says he starts
14:00 running because he knows how to be a
14:01 criminal right he starts run and I'm
14:03 just standing there and the preacher
14:06 opens the door and he's like you know
14:09 you come here a little minute look I
14:11 didn't do it he did it that kid running
14:12 down the sidewalk right there did it but
14:15 I don't know why my cousin was walking
14:17 home with because he didn't live in the
14:18 area I don't know what the deal was
14:20 anyway I got hauled in taking down I
14:23 mean it calls my mom and then you know
14:25 he wouldn't buy your mom to pay for the
14:27 window or whatever I don't even know
14:28 what happened to it I think she told him
14:30 look it's not my kid trust me my kids
14:33 like the straightest lace kid the world
14:35 and you you're not gonna extort money
14:36 out of me just cuz he was standing next
14:38 to subdue SHhhh bag what she turned on
14:40 my cousin or not I don't know but you
14:42 behaved is what I'm trying to get at but
14:46 then we get to the 90s and things
14:50 changed at home well one personal
14:53 computer started to explode
14:55 and pretty much by the late 80s everyone
14:58 you know who wanted a computer in their
15:00 home had one and it wasn't uncommon for
15:03 at least two rooms to have a computer
15:06 but they were really really expensive I
15:09 mean my first computer I bought in 89
15:11 was I think no sorry it was them right
15:14 because my company always provided a
15:16 computer for me but the first one ever
15:18 bought and it was 91 and it was a 2vx
15:22 Macintosh was thirty seven hundred bucks
15:26 Jesus I would spend thirty seven hundred
15:28 dollars today there's something else
15:31 started occurring those game consoles
15:34 started to appear in every single kid's
15:37 bedroom maybe there was one out front
15:40 but every kid had one in the bedroom so
15:42 he had two or three different brothers
15:43 just depends on their age brackets
15:45 there's usually two in the
15:46 because they can't you know agree on
15:49 what games to play and most of them are
15:51 single player in the first place all
15:54 right then
15:55 kids will start getting computers each
15:57 kids getting a computer well that starts
16:00 upping the game in America where you're
16:03 expected to have these things from your
16:05 parents I can't even imagine my my dad
16:09 buying me a computer like I said when I
16:11 got my first computer in the 80s that
16:13 was my property my buddies dad wanted
16:17 from RadioShack
16:18 it was like a it was I don't was a cocoa
16:21 to computer ballpoint pen printer a
16:24 cassette player and the cables to hook
16:27 to a monitor I think is worth 500 bucks
16:31 but I think my dad's buddy had rebuilt
16:34 his engine at our house a station wagon
16:36 engine which I got to see which is
16:39 really cool I think he just sold to my
16:41 dad for 50 bucks just does it thank you
16:44 I was my first computers 50 bucks but
16:47 before the 90s was out think about the
16:51 difference between entering the 90s
16:52 where hmm Super Nintendo comes out
16:55 starts replacing a lot of pcs but a lot
16:59 of kids wouldn't double down on the PC
17:00 side of things and parents were supposed
17:03 to be supporting their kids you know
17:06 because the kid's gonna want a computer
17:07 at least at 1415 years old and you know
17:10 the cheapest PC at the time was at least
17:12 1500 bucks but most kids want the better
17:14 video card the better sound card so
17:17 these machines are hitting 2500 bucks
17:19 easy but they also want the console in
17:23 their bedroom
17:23 and what do consoles require well they
17:26 require it depending on which one you
17:28 had a bunch of cartridges for 25 30
17:31 bucks by the time the decade was over
17:34 these things are $40 an average PC game
17:37 was always 39 bucks okay
17:42 that's a huge improvement in the list of
17:46 amenities of a kid in America but about
17:50 96 97 cell phones start to come in did
17:54 your first analog flip phones then you
17:55 had some digital candy bars I'm sure
17:58 those things were just rotten our
17:59 bodies some parents some would actually
18:05 spin that on their kids but not many you
18:07 have to understand around 1988 in the
18:09 Bay Area
18:10 you know Silicon Valley my Netcom email
18:13 address cost me forty five bucks a month
18:17 and that didn't guarantee me any
18:20 connection to the Internet they didn't
18:22 provide a modem service I had to have a
18:23 different modem service on top of that
18:25 which was like 70 or 80 bucks a month
18:28 okay well those amenities started going
18:30 into the house it really didn't take off
18:32 until the 2002 thousands by 2010 let's
18:37 just say now video games cost 70 bucks
18:41 Computers smile you know get one for
18:44 1,200 up to 30,000 but the parents are
18:47 always on the hook for this stuff mom I
18:49 deserve a phone that cost $700 at the
18:52 time I deserve a cell phone package I
18:56 deserve the game console
18:58 I deserve you know 30 games that cost 70
19:01 bucks apiece the game consoles now
19:03 anywhere from 400 to 500 dollars when it
19:06 first comes out this was all just
19:10 standard operation so the parents are
19:13 now out thousands of dollars a year and
19:15 I mean thousands of dollars a year
19:18 because the amenity pool in this country
19:21 went up today how crazy is it phones are
19:26 now 900 to 2500 dollars depending on
19:30 which ones you're buying I doubt many
19:32 parents buy the top in one but you're
19:34 always gonna buy one it's 5,000 bucks
19:35 yeah you can add a line onto your
19:38 existing line for your 40 bucks
19:40 computers well they're still extremely
19:44 expensive you know maybe get your kid
19:47 the $1,200 one but you know what if
19:49 you're going to the store your kid's
19:50 gonna whine and complain that I need the
19:52 one that's $2,000 they gotta carry it
19:56 around now they have to have iPads - or
19:59 tablets this is negating clothing you
20:04 know various bragging rights we got to
20:07 go on certain vacations so we can brag
20:09 on Monday and this is just you know you
20:13 don't
20:13 love me if you don't get me these things
20:15 and this doesn't include birthdays and
20:17 Christmas in this country birthdays and
20:21 Christmas are a translation of how much
20:23 does your parent really love you because
20:25 if you don't get a bunch of stuff and
20:28 you have to go to school and your
20:29 friends say well what did you get and
20:31 you have to say nothing or some crappy
20:33 stuff well then you from that degenerate
20:36 family and you're you know you should
20:38 hang your head in shame hmm now
20:43 meanwhile let's go back to the 80s and
20:47 this run this again a little faster on a
20:50 different metric okay
20:53 well around 1980 and I heard Lionel
20:56 nation quote this completely wrong just
20:59 recently was shocked me this is why
21:01 stayin in school is cool man and really
21:04 when you want to save your awake you
21:06 just need to have a really good memory
21:08 and then listen to everything you can
21:09 get your hands on and then go do your
21:11 research to make sure what you're
21:13 listening to is true or false but he
21:16 brought up the fact that the Iranians
21:18 and the seventies had detained I can't
21:21 remember exactly how many over a hundred
21:23 of our folks for 444 days a little over
21:29 a year and a half right around of your
21:32 kness okay so these you know I remember
21:39 this the hostages were detained held and
21:42 there was all kinds of you know t-shirts
21:45 it would say you know [ __ ] Ron and you
21:47 know had like t-shirts I think even
21:49 Eddie from Iron Maiden had a piece of
21:53 artwork like that or someone drew
21:55 something like that but it was always
21:56 you know you know hey - Ron hey Ron
21:58 they weren't torturing our folks I don't
22:00 think but it came time for the election
22:04 late 79 80 and George Bush Senior is on
22:10 record flying to Iran he's running for
22:15 vice president the inside scoop was that
22:19 Iran was ready to let these hostages go
22:22 they were really tired of all the
22:23 pressure and the you know the
22:25 worldview on them for doing this but
22:30 George Bush Senior flew over there and
22:31 negotiated for them to be released just
22:33 the second after Reagan got in office I
22:38 think as Lionel ination said the part he
22:41 got correct was that within an hour I
22:44 believe of Nick of Reagan taking office
22:47 we got the phone call and all these
22:49 folks are coming on so other than that
22:53 from 1980 I mean once the Vietnam War
22:56 ended by 1975 which oddly wasn't
22:59 discussed much around me which is really
23:02 really strange I mean it ended and we
23:05 didn't you know we had soldiers coming
23:06 home but there wasn't like any dinner
23:08 table talk about oh my god you to hear
23:10 about songs oh he's totally crazy now or
23:12 did you hear about so they came home
23:13 safe I don't remember anyone coming home
23:16 but I know that well as I grew up in the
23:18 80s I learned about the guys that came
23:20 back from Vietnam
23:21 so there were tons of them and they just
23:24 didn't talk about it was really strange
23:25 so it straight into disco fever and
23:28 heavy rock and roll you know we had van
23:30 Halen popping up in the late 70s but by
23:34 the 80s you have from 1980 pretty much I
23:37 guess until 89 but now I guess all the
23:41 way oh sorry I'll be up to 90 because
23:42 the Desert Storm thing happened just
23:45 inside the next decade the 80s had
23:48 nothing at no point was American lifes
23:55 threatened on a daily basis when we woke
23:57 up yeah we knew about the Cold War with
24:00 the Russians but that had all devolved
24:02 down to us believing that every time
24:06 they want to wipe their but they're
24:07 standing in a line you know it's a mile
24:09 long just to get some toilet paper and
24:11 it's like that was heavily exaggerated
24:13 because there were only a few places in
24:14 Russia that actually had that problem
24:15 but they were suffering you know
24:19 tremendously because the regime was
24:21 utterly bankrupt and they couldn't keep
24:23 the place open and we know that because
24:24 it's not that way anymore
24:26 that's quite opposite Bounty's Moscow
24:29 looks like I don't know it's an odyssey
24:32 of money at this point if you haven't
24:34 watched a little documentary on Moscow
24:36 in the last two years
24:37 do yourself a favor watch one
24:40 if Moscow looks like a gigantic Rodeo
24:42 Drive now it looks like Dubai it has so
24:46 is anyone Street probably has ten
24:49 million dollars with the cars parked on
24:51 it at any point in time
24:52 is nuts right it's very it's for
24:56 gangster I think still in the business
24:58 sense but not gangster and maybe the
24:59 violence sense so in 1980 1990 nothing
25:03 man
25:03 and what that afforded Americans at the
25:07 time was that we were waiting for the
25:08 American Dream to trigger for all of us
25:11 than our teens this is where we got the
25:14 Yuppie craze in the in the 80s here in
25:16 America yuppies were successful people
25:21 BMWs whether it was a 320 I was the car
25:25 of choice in you you know California was
25:28 was loving it and digging it in when I
25:31 got out here I was in the middle of just
25:35 a mecca of success everything was
25:37 successful when I got here in 87 with
25:39 the Republican governor the
25:41 entertainment industry was utterly
25:42 booming the real estate market was
25:45 booming I got any industry you wanted to
25:49 get into I mean everyone was happy it
25:51 was crazy how happy everybody was I've
25:54 said several times and again I'm gonna
25:56 mention this video there's a video out
25:58 there that says something about the
26:01 1980s and it's a kid walking into a
26:03 7-eleven with the video camera because
26:05 that was also an amenity that showed up
26:07 for families and it keep it's just
26:09 filming people in a 7-eleven and you
26:11 just get the sense of how happy we were
26:15 I mean it was like and we think that's a
26:17 defect today I think that's what's
26:18 really sad you know what you're not hard
26:21 I don't know maybe today what wasn't
26:25 back in those days so what happens in
26:28 the 90s well we had a tiny distraction
26:31 in the early 90s which was Desert Storm
26:34 obviously as a result of Saddam Hussein
26:36 invaded Kuwait but what we need to
26:40 remember about that is that Saddam
26:42 Hussein one was an asset of ours okay
26:45 that's why Donald Rumsfeld goes over and
26:47 shakes his hand and sells some chemical
26:48 weapons which then he uses on the Kurds
26:50 and we're completely immune from this
26:52 liability but he calls the State
26:55 Department he says I want to invade
26:58 Kuwait because it's land that was taken
27:00 away from my country and we're gonna
27:02 claim it because there's also a lot of
27:04 oil reserves on it and those are ours
27:07 the State Department told him ok
27:10 go for it so he invaded obviously it was
27:14 a very quick invasion they immediately
27:16 started tapping the oil wells they
27:18 immediately started taking over things
27:20 now we don't know what actually happened
27:22 over there because we have caught so
27:24 many I guess you could call them early
27:26 early jinhwan crisis actors going into
27:29 the Senate and lying about torturing
27:31 which has now all been exposed that we
27:34 don't know if they did anything
27:36 horrendous you know war doesn't make
27:39 people crazy but usual it makes people
27:40 crazy because someone's fighting back
27:43 against you and that starts to rot your
27:45 mind and then reaping and pillaging is
27:47 sort of like synonymous with pulling a
27:49 trigger when they're just sitting there
27:51 going oh my god you're here what you
27:52 know I'm sure some of you people fought
27:55 back for a little while but anyway he
27:56 rolls over that place then the Saudis
27:59 call the State Department and say what
28:02 the hell did you just do he says you
28:05 gave him permission yeah well it's not
28:08 it's not you like yeah well that just
28:10 bolstered his his play in the Middle
28:13 East and you just gave him a ton of oil
28:15 that's our product and so now we're
28:16 gonna be in some pricing battle with
28:18 this guy get him out of there oh okay
28:22 and who the hell knows what they did
28:23 after that they must have called the guy
28:25 okey please leave you know Kuwait and
28:27 he's like what you kidding me gave me
28:29 permission this is a big operation
28:31 what do you mean pull out and of course
28:34 bush senior bombs living crap out of him
28:39 and then we roll in there for the 48
28:42 hour invasion
28:43 we don't go to Baghdad why because he's
28:46 one of our assets he's safe we have the
28:48 highway of death which is sort of the
28:51 see Saudis we really hurt him bad see
28:55 Kuwait we really hurt him bad see this
28:56 horrible highway you know and I'm sure
28:59 horrible things happen I don't know but
29:00 it's Desert Storm I remember I was at
29:02 work
29:03 and it was really interesting with this
29:05 Jewish guy they didn't look Jewish at
29:08 all was really weird but he said he's
29:09 from Israel big guy he's the guy that
29:11 got his blood taken at a blood drive bus
29:16 and right when I was walking in with my
29:19 girlfriend he ended up going into
29:20 convulsions because he was so amount
29:21 nutrition for meeting couple of noodles
29:23 every single day washing it down with
29:25 Mountain Dew poor dude he nearly died he
29:30 was gone with for three weeks and then
29:31 he came back and he had all that crap
29:34 was out of his cube he used to keep big
29:36 big pyramids of cup of noodle and then
29:39 the cans that he had already considered
29:40 as early was a grown man it's strange
29:42 but he comes running in the room and
29:44 he's so thrilled to death that were
29:46 attacking Saddam Hussein I just thought
29:49 that was kind of weird it was like
29:51 overly jovial as opposed to mild you
29:54 hear what's going on okay and he does
29:55 her storm alright but after that nothing
30:01 1991 to 2000 we are living in a
30:07 distraction called the Internet birth
30:10 with the HTTP protocol so I'm in the bay
30:13 area for most of that decade for nine
30:15 years of that decade and I'm in the
30:18 video game business for the most of that
30:19 time and I'm watching you know I'm
30:25 feeding these kids these games right and
30:27 one way or another
30:29 now I'm self-employed before a majority
30:34 of that time through being a contractor
30:36 and so you know I only have the
30:40 amenities that I can afford which was
30:41 pretty much everything I wanted but
30:44 seeing kids walk around with what I had
30:46 when I was making tons of money it was
30:48 really shocking news like you know it
30:50 did take a while but I mean I would go
30:52 over to my friends houses and they had
30:53 little brothers and stuff and every kid
30:55 had him to snez in their room a Super
30:57 Nintendo in the room was like really is
31:00 that is that that an inexpensive I don't
31:02 remember what those things cost but
31:05 America did not grow up with threats
31:08 over their heads of any invasion from
31:11 anywhere but he bombs being dropped from
31:14 anywhere
31:15 then we cross over into the next decade
31:19 and we have kids very similar to the
31:22 beginning of Vietnam now what was it
31:25 technically I guess 63 64 where these
31:29 kids were coming out of them 40s 50s you
31:32 know the early 60s and they're running
31:34 into this jungle war and they're shocked
31:37 you know yet nineteen year old kids that
31:39 have never seen anything like that in
31:40 their life and all of a sudden it's like
31:41 here's a gun and you're gonna find out
31:44 what your dad did in World War two
31:46 except there's no roads so that you're
31:48 just in jungle 24/7 some of my friends
31:52 who are ex Vietnam vets they always get
31:54 really pissed off when they see platoon
31:57 movies and stuff where these kids are
31:59 walking on roads or like man I was there
32:01 for three years and we never stepped on
32:02 one road it was jungle jungle jungle you
32:05 know you know that that interesting
32:08 story you know I heard was like we would
32:11 take a hill and we'd set up and we dig
32:14 little holes and put our stuff in the
32:16 little holes and whatever and then we'd
32:18 be run out of that the next week and
32:20 then you know two months later we'd take
32:22 it back and they had you know upgraded
32:25 the holes yeah it was like everyone was
32:27 sharing places in Vietnam is just
32:30 atrocious war right but of course that
32:33 day in September 11th happens 2001 and
32:37 all the sudden the party's over
32:40 the neo-cons had decided to create this
32:43 inside job attack which you know again
32:46 we're still blaming other countries for
32:48 that kind of thing and it's like are you
32:49 kidding me right look you'll see my
32:52 episode called that day if you want to
32:55 see an episode on the day of September
32:59 1st for September 11 scuse me but then
33:03 we now see something ultra horrific you
33:09 know again because most of us believed
33:10 everything for at least a first couple
33:12 years I believed it all for two and a
33:14 half years until I saw micro Rupert's
33:17 video on 9/11 and then all of a sudden
33:20 it started changing for me now Michael's
33:22 position was that the war was I'm sorry
33:24 that that attack on that day was by the
33:26 individuals that were claimed to be
33:28 those in
33:28 vigils but that it was all boiled in
33:31 from the inside then later of course we
33:34 all realized if anyone from outside this
33:38 country helped they were just doing some
33:41 neocon a favor
33:42 you know but now you have a weird split
33:45 in psychology there are some kids
33:48 because they crash the economy in 2002
33:51 to make sure that no one had a future
33:53 you had to go into the military if you
33:56 were underprivileged right if you if you
33:58 were literally at the wrong age to
34:00 become an engineer in the 90s and get
34:04 yourself a job where you can you don't
34:05 have to go on a list but say you're just
34:08 turning 16 17 18 around 2001 and at a
34:12 couple of years they crash the economy
34:14 you come out you got no money your
34:16 parents have no money and you need to go
34:18 somewhere and so you join the military
34:19 it's all a setup
34:21 okay but now you have parents of the
34:26 kids that don't have to go because
34:27 they're so young they now feel burdened
34:31 no one ever talks about this they feel
34:35 burdened because society has turned dark
34:39 and again like Nick Rockefeller told
34:42 arizo eleven months before 9/11 there's
34:45 going to be an event and it is going to
34:48 catalyze a war that will last a hundred
34:50 years what they what he told him bad
34:54 news right and again we just shut this
34:56 down with latest president so the
35:00 parents feel like in order to distract
35:02 their kids from a war-torn terrorist
35:06 filled world at this point right the TSA
35:10 shows up at the airports you know as
35:12 I've had it communicated to me no
35:14 airport in the United States of America
35:15 has to accept the TSA but they love the
35:19 paycheck when you go to Hawaii it's
35:22 different man you walk through door
35:24 jambs you don't get all patted down I
35:26 mean they have those people there like
35:28 they always did if you look really
35:29 suspect yes they do profile you because
35:32 that's what they're hired to do I mean
35:34 my god you mean to tell me you that a
35:36 bank guard doesn't profile every person
35:38 in his brain as soon as they walk
35:40 through the front door
35:41 yeah what if a guy comes in with a ski
35:44 mask on and a bulge in his in his trench
35:47 coat okay well if that bank guard looks
35:52 at that guy as a liberal you know
35:55 blowhard you're not allowed to to stop
35:58 him because you're being prejudiced
36:00 against people in ski masks wanting to
36:01 do withdraws and you know now there's no
36:04 exception with their methodology of
36:06 course we profile people now profiling
36:10 is ridiculous in this country now right
36:13 they will just take I've got so many
36:16 friends that are black and they'll just
36:17 say look man I can't get through I got
36:20 friends who are brown I mean obviously
36:23 black people are brown too but like they
36:25 kind of could pass for Arab but they're
36:28 Mexican and so they said yeah they
36:31 always pull me aside cuz I look Arab
36:34 yeah it's out of control right now
36:36 totally out of control but the parents
36:39 started loading up the kids with
36:40 distractions and of course marketing
36:43 departments do a great job making sure
36:46 the kids who can't afford it always have
36:48 it and so again it's the Jones me thing
36:51 you go to school and all the kids are
36:53 wearing that that t-shirt or that those
36:55 pair of shoes or whatever the jewelry
36:57 whatever and now it's a cell phone
36:59 I always skip beepers because I I forget
37:03 they even existed but yes we had those
37:05 beepers in the 90s and beepers weren't
37:09 that sexy D kids from what I remember I
37:12 had one like everybody had one at in
37:16 their 20s but you ended up paying for it
37:17 you know wasn't like parents really feel
37:19 like their kids needed beepers but I
37:22 remember that well this thing's just
37:25 evaporated didn't they it's like they
37:27 don't it's like they never existed it's
37:29 really funny but what starts happening
37:31 in the first decade of the 21st century
37:36 we get the first through social media
37:41 right we get first book and that's
37:45 obviously a DARPA project that was
37:47 transferred into that corporation
37:49 through the ink you tell dude so DARPA
37:52 could cancel their project and now we
37:54 have this
37:55 again fake straw man who's in charge
37:57 which is why they create movies about
38:00 Facebook they're trying to rewrite
38:02 history away from what really occurred
38:04 to create that company they always do
38:06 that
38:07 Benghazi how many people saw the
38:09 Benghazi movie they tell you that the
38:12 Ambassador died inside the embassy of
38:17 smoke inhalation well go look at the
38:19 video they dragged the guy all around
38:22 that town they tortured him with cow
38:24 prods electrical cow prawns they just
38:27 dragged his body behind I think a
38:28 motorcycle or something this guy died as
38:33 far as I could tell a horrific death and
38:36 Hollywood dishonored his suffering by
38:39 crediting this [ __ ] movie that he
38:42 just died peacefully in smoke inhalation
38:44 which is like suffocation horrid but
38:48 they do it to protect those that are
38:50 responsible which is basically Hillary
38:52 Clinton and Barack Obama because they
38:55 were doing a stinger missile
38:57 swap out of that particular area to get
38:59 all the guns over to Isis you know they
39:03 make two movies about Steve Jobs and
39:04 basically take a few moments and this
39:07 guy's entire 57 year life or 56 year
39:10 life and make entire movies out of just
39:13 the most you know infinitesimal
39:16 embarrassing moments of his entire life
39:17 imagine that any of us had that happen
39:19 to us right all of us have regretful
39:22 moments oK we've said things that are
39:25 horrible or you know like with Steve
39:28 it's really strange because you have and
39:30 this is this is almost right up the same
39:33 alley of coddled Americans you have at
39:35 least 12 guys that help build a
39:37 macintosh computer they were taught by
39:40 Steve that you could accomplish way more
39:42 than you ever thought you could but
39:43 you're gonna have to have someone push
39:45 you really hard the guy Steve got in
39:47 masseuses he had a grand piano brought
39:50 in had someone play classical music to
39:51 them the guy was loading them up with
39:53 tons of amenities any food that they
39:54 wanted anything that they wanted but he
39:56 pushed them really hard and there's at
39:58 least two nerds I don't even know their
40:01 names are who have done little
40:02 documentaries about Steve and they just
40:04 take a giant dump on Steve constantly
40:06 you know what's ironic about it
40:09 they get these interviews and make money
40:11 off of Steve you know one they have a
40:14 stock options okay they make tons of
40:18 money off the fact that Steve taught
40:19 them how to do that how to get more out
40:21 of themselves and they still like a
40:24 typical Bay Area [ __ ] person take a
40:26 [ __ ] on Steve as you know in spite of
40:30 all the things that you gave them
40:31 there's not a single kind word from
40:33 these couple guys most of them don't do
40:36 that most of them enjoy their giant
40:38 warehouse full of Ferraris so we get
40:42 social media social media starts to
40:44 bleed back into society
40:46 now we've always had a piece of this in
40:49 society but it started to go to like a
40:51 much more intense level which is you
40:54 know coffee shops have always been
40:55 around coffee shops turned into diners
40:58 who turned into sort of like these
41:01 Starbucks now that you can go and chill
41:02 out and you got some Wi-Fi and that kind
41:04 of thing so that thing starts to explode
41:05 at the same time which is where we start
41:08 getting blogging the newspaper reporters
41:12 and columnist go from print into these
41:14 coffee shops that start you know waxing
41:18 poetic from their laptop
41:20 well it's something interesting about
41:22 that it's sort of like a virtual reality
41:25 you have a home where all your stinky
41:28 laundry is and where the bills are
41:30 piling up piling up and then you have
41:31 this coffee shop you kind of walk in the
41:34 door and you create your own world who's
41:41 bad who's good and of course you're
41:44 getting tips and cues from people your
41:46 respects I guess then you start creating
41:48 your own little world online a persona
41:50 an extra persona guess persona in the
41:53 real world then you got a persona online
41:55 hmm well what do we have happen when the
42:00 internet finally gained a grip on things
42:02 we had all these trolls show up people
42:06 that had no method no requirement excuse
42:08 me to identify who they were and we
42:12 still can do this today of course but it
42:14 was really really bad I mean there was
42:15 until like Facebook I mean you really
42:18 could just be you were expected not to
42:20 be yourself
42:22 and when Facebook said oh I can help you
42:25 brag about your life homeboy you really
42:27 wanted to be you and get it all on your
42:29 face of your friends right but before
42:32 the decades over we get a new president
42:36 we lose you know Bush jr. so again I
42:41 will go to my death bed thinking that
42:44 that guy never wanted to be President
42:46 for a day I think he just wanted to
42:49 chill out and do his thing but it was
42:50 two pieces dad on one level and you know
42:54 probably doesn't mind being in the
42:56 history books he's far more intelligent
42:59 than he behaves on TV I do think he's
43:03 got issues you know he used to be
43:05 alcoholic used to be a coke addict when
43:08 it was a massively rich kid he's not
43:11 ugly so you know but in the end mm-hmm
43:15 married a decent woman and you know Bush
43:18 the bush green kids all have issues
43:19 unfortunately I think everyone's calming
43:21 down now so it's cool but we get this
43:24 run for 2008 and at first it was as I
43:31 understand it the Bilderberg Group told
43:33 Hillary Clinton in May
43:34 she's the pic and so in a and entitled
43:39 methodology she didn't run much she
43:41 didn't stop much all throughout the
43:44 summer 2007 but Obama pounded the
43:49 concrete man this dude was everywhere
43:51 and well I can't remember if I honestly
43:56 can't remember who was first one I don't
43:58 know if that was the bikini Palin thing
43:59 I gets kind of sketchy I think it's part
44:02 of my dark history I try to block out
44:04 anyway by August the Bilderberg Group
44:07 told Obama you're the pick Hillary's out
44:10 Hillary gets pissed they give her the
44:13 State Department job she wires her
44:15 foundation directly to the State
44:16 Department and a pay-for-play situation
44:18 and the rest is history
44:20 secret email server you know tons of
44:22 classified stuff going out due to
44:25 WikiLeaks and Julian Assange we know
44:27 more of what happened today than ever
44:30 before
44:31 but now we've got this weird situation
44:34 where we see crimes not in the sense of
44:39 like September 11th were you know
44:42 physics was actually absolutely denied
44:45 right physics was denied to bring down
44:47 the World Trade Centers you know we just
44:49 had this crash of this Ukrainian airline
44:53 in Tehran right Tehran which they think
44:58 it was accidentally shot down by their
44:59 own people thinking that it was a plane
45:01 coming in to bomb the missile field
45:05 which was just after the airport so here
45:07 comes this plane right right over and
45:10 they think someone just shot it out of
45:12 sky oddly enough there was like I don't
45:16 know almost 40% of the passengers were
45:18 Canadian like why are there so many
45:22 Canadians in Tehran it just blows my
45:24 mind but let's look at the rubble of
45:27 Tehran when that plane hit the ground
45:29 it's all over the place got a tail fin
45:32 you got engines you got plane parts
45:34 people parts all this stuff big chunks
45:37 of the fuselage well you don't have any
45:39 of that the Pentagon you don't have any
45:41 of that honestly don't have it really at
45:44 Ground Zero you have an engine that that
45:47 a witness said was pushed out of the
45:48 back of a white van and then Shanksville
45:53 hilarious flight 93 is nowhere to be
45:56 found
45:57 recently the farmer said that hole in
45:58 the ground I cut it a couple years
46:00 before this whole event occurred but up
46:01 stole the shut up the corner for 93 said
46:04 I never saw any blood samples body parts
46:06 or anything but I had to rule over how
46:08 everybody died okey so that was sort of
46:14 like you know really tough for US
46:18 citizens to deal with in America because
46:20 we were like can't you see this doesn't
46:23 make any sense I mean just take high
46:24 school physics and you're gonna find out
46:26 none of this is possible but but by the
46:29 time the Democrats took over now we're
46:32 dealing with weird agenda things civil
46:36 war kind of stuff or it's like hey black
46:40 person hey all of your ailments are
46:42 because of the white folk a white person
46:45 you should not populate because you have
46:47 too much privilege a Mexican's you
46:49 should just own America you know your
46:52 race didn't exist when Christopher
46:54 Columbus came over here but now that
46:56 you've been created by you know mixing
46:58 with Europeans like a lot of other folks
46:59 in America and how it's just something
47:01 yours crazy weird things but our
47:08 president that we now know Barack Obama
47:10 was a complete trader complete and utter
47:13 traitor he was handing this whole
47:15 country over to Europe that was his goal
47:18 to hand it over to the EU you know the
47:22 just so you know in October of 2016 that
47:27 right yeah October 2016 Obama signed
47:33 over the control of the American
47:34 Internet to the International ICANN
47:36 foundation ICA in in I am now getting
47:40 emails from a European Organization
47:44 telling me what I have to do to to
47:48 legally own my domains which is to keep
47:50 all my information up-to-date it's
47:52 pretty easy I lived in the same place
47:53 for 17 years pretty simple but I got
47:57 friends of mine that recently moved for
48:01 various emergency reasons and so their
48:03 domain information is out of date they
48:06 are old so they don't have all their
48:08 login information they don't even
48:09 understand what the hell I cants talking
48:11 about and so all the sudden now normal
48:14 people are in violation of European
48:17 control oh okay we're now finding out
48:22 John McCain you know went over to the
48:24 Middle East and helped found Isis
48:27 there's reason to believe that he was
48:29 actually also delivering you know
48:31 uranium samples from the uranium one
48:34 cell that Barack Obama and Hillary
48:38 Clinton granted which sold twenty four
48:40 point nine percent of our uranium to a
48:43 Canadian company which was then bought
48:44 by Putin no one has any problem with
48:48 that so we have seen this
48:53 this whole thing get incubated up and it
48:57 is it is a very interesting thing there
49:01 I'll tell you this much so I'll give you
49:03 a really bizarre analogy there are
49:06 receptors in the human body all over the
49:09 human body that are designed to take
49:12 various chemicals because that's what's
49:14 supposed to go in that particular part
49:16 of your body okay so anything that comes
49:20 in tries to go into the receptor it's
49:21 not supposed to be there it's not
49:23 compatible physically and so it bounces
49:24 out and gets washed away by the immune
49:27 system or it finds its spots someplace
49:28 else so take that analogy and overlay it
49:31 on to the United States citizens these
49:34 decades and decades of prepping the kids
49:37 to constantly tell a child well you
49:40 don't have a you know a Playstation in
49:43 your bedroom when you should really talk
49:45 to your parents about that because all
49:46 kids deserve Playstations in the
49:47 bedrooms and of course all that gives
49:48 away yeah of course you're good parent
49:51 goes I don't know maybe if you get all
49:55 straight A's at school there's only
49:57 gonna be one in the whole house I don't
50:00 necessarily want to play it so you can
50:01 keep in your bedroom but if you got
50:02 brothers and sisters that you're gonna
50:04 have to share and you're gonna have to
50:05 work that out I hear any you know
50:07 arguing for any length of time I'm gonna
50:10 take it and throw it in the trash or
50:11 sell it to the kid next door so you
50:13 gonna be screwed so you better learn how
50:14 to you know negotiate and get along but
50:18 these kids have worked groomed to be
50:22 receptors for this agenda to create all
50:27 this dissonance meaning descending
50:33 against Authority you know by the time
50:37 you got to the 90s little kids would
50:39 tell you to go [ __ ] yourself it was
50:41 amazing and they feared nothing and half
50:45 of its because when they go home they're
50:46 like my parents don't pay attention to
50:48 me at all so you're telling me that if
50:49 you ring the doorbell and tell my parent
50:51 that I've done something bad that
50:52 they're suddenly gonna care they're
50:54 gonna tell you to go [ __ ] yourself too
50:56 because that's who I'm being raised by
50:59 why because the parents realize that the
51:03 job opportunities started going away the
51:06 pay
51:06 raises started going away stock options
51:09 that you might have at your company all
51:10 they figured out how to screw you out of
51:11 that remember when I first well a long
51:15 time ago I told you about all game
51:17 companies that were ever successful in
51:19 the 90s would offer profit sharing with
51:22 their employees I mean every single one
51:24 I know of little tiny ones you own part
51:26 of the company anyway because that's
51:27 just the way it worked but Blizzard used
51:30 to do it Electronic Arts used to do it
51:32 Activision used to do it you made a
51:33 great game you got a huge chunk of the
51:35 profits now they're making hundreds of
51:38 millions and you're making maybe a few
51:40 hundred thousand but that's a whole buy
51:42 a whole house if you made one game
51:43 really well and people did but by the
51:47 mid 90s even Electronic Arts started
51:51 doing they did a two step process it was
51:52 like someone figured it out and then
51:54 everybody did it they said okay well
51:56 instead of having Department centric
51:59 bonuses meaning if your department did a
52:02 good game and the other department
52:03 didn't you got a big check and they
52:04 didn't first step was to pool the whole
52:07 company together and what was very
52:10 unfair about that is that again a lazy
52:12 person will always be lazy if they think
52:15 well that group over there's got all the
52:17 good games we don't need to work that
52:18 hard just push it out it destroyed the
52:20 integrity of the company itself until
52:24 there were no bonuses oh you had this
52:28 401k and you could always buy options
52:31 all the time but you never got him
52:33 anymore for free when you get a little
52:35 tiny bit maybe on a good year but I was
52:38 at I was there at EA when we hit the
52:40 first billion dollars nothing to happen
52:42 to my paycheck then I was there we hit
52:45 three billion and you know I got a bonus
52:48 but it's cuz I was so high up in the
52:50 company it was just standard bonus for
52:52 my position not because anything great
52:53 happened in the company it is part of
52:56 your employment contract right so now
52:59 we're sitting here in 2020 a super duper
53:03 bad guy has been eliminated out of this
53:07 world and you know how it works you know
53:09 it's it's just exactly like what is it
53:12 Charlie Chaplin said he goes as long as
53:14 men die Liberty will prevail
53:18 and it's because you know the guys who
53:21 run the world do die at some point I
53:23 believe me they're trying to conquer
53:24 that problem too but the fact that you
53:28 have news organizations like CNN the
53:34 Communist news or the news network
53:35 having them bolster up this guy as being
53:43 a hero blows me away that you don't have
53:47 the very next day or the very next
53:49 minute or hour after that all of the
53:52 listeners going what are you talking
53:54 about
53:54 you apologize that's ridiculous we can
53:59 go and count the guys casualties in fact
54:02 I saw some video it was inside another
54:04 video where someone had basically said
54:06 that they're trying to assess how many
54:10 deaths the sky is related to slash
54:12 orchestrated and they're still counting
54:15 because there's so many claims against
54:17 this dude but I mean it is a huge number
54:21 and it's Americans it's Europeans it's
54:24 Kurds it's all the different groups in
54:28 the Middle East it's bad but now what do
54:32 we always talk about on the show because
54:34 I just said it in the canceled culture
54:36 episode which is the kids who are
54:39 protesting and trying to change the
54:42 country now it's the point of our First
54:44 Amendment is to be able to descend
54:47 against your country if our descent I
54:49 should say against your country if you
54:51 don't like what's going on that's your
54:53 privilege that's what the First
54:54 Amendment grants you and we have a
54:57 Second Amendment to protect a first in
54:58 case anyone tries to take away that
55:00 right okay great but we have a boatload
55:05 of crazy Democrats who have a ton of
55:09 followers who don't know anything about
55:11 anything it's funny like I said it can
55:12 interview a Democrat and well they have
55:14 so many opinions but man once you start
55:16 asking the key players of the world you
55:18 don't know anything and then they'll
55:19 tell you to your face I don't follow you
55:22 that stuff well then shut the [ __ ] up
55:24 would you because you know no offense
55:26 here man but you're trying to effect
55:27 change on our country trying to
55:29 undermine our Constitution but you don't
55:32 even know what the
55:33 Constitution says let alone all the
55:35 agendas that are aimed at it and the
55:37 individuals that you're supporting that
55:39 are championing the destruction of the
55:41 Constitution so that you lose the right
55:43 to be who you are the greatest facade
55:47 the greatest ally and the greatest
55:49 misunderstanding by those that feel like
55:51 they're the chosen ones is that they're
55:54 not the chosen ones that's the the
55:58 hilarious inside joke that is created by
56:02 this bizarre hubris of these kids which
56:05 is you're not on the list
56:07 when they depart the world you die it's
56:11 just as simple you're not on the list
56:13 so stop defending the destruction of the
56:15 world if you think the world shouldn't
56:17 have you in the world where you can make
56:19 a decision about whether you want your
56:20 stay or not but you know it's kind of
56:25 cowardly to run away from something you
56:26 could affect change too that would make
56:28 it positive
56:29 if socialism comes around then we're
56:33 gonna have this bizarre you know sort of
56:35 bait and switch algorithm that's going
56:37 to occur which is socialism promises
56:40 everything right why not say anything
56:43 and then just do whatever you want
56:46 afterwards remember George Bush Senior
56:49 read my lips no new taxes and then the
56:51 dude raised taxes
56:53 Wow didn't you get it but but a Democrat
56:56 will say oh that was a Republican and
56:58 you're like okay Obama lied every single
57:01 time you ever talked about his health
57:02 care program telling you you keep your
57:04 doctor you can keep your plant you
57:05 couldn't do either thing and your
57:08 premiums went up 4x from the day that it
57:11 was first offered horrific you know I've
57:15 dealt with startups so many times it's
57:18 this I've lost count let's put that way
57:21 but I have been in situations where
57:25 someone is trying to pitch a product and
57:27 they haven't really thought it through
57:29 and there's an investor who's a good
57:32 person who's willing to trust the
57:34 individual who is pitching the product
57:36 and this the scenario is a very sad
57:38 scenario for everybody involved but the
57:43 person who is like I just really want to
57:45 have my own business and be successful
57:46 accessible they will literally say to
57:49 themselves and sometimes admitted to
57:50 people like myself well you know we just
57:53 need to get the guy's money and then
57:55 once we get the guy's money we will have
57:57 enough time with that money to figure
58:00 out all the things that we can't answer
58:01 right now
58:03 all right well investors don't give you
58:06 money on those principles on those on
58:08 those objectives they're like no you get
58:11 your crap together because I want every
58:13 dollar I give you to go towards the
58:15 solution now it might be that you know
58:17 you need to build a part and you haven't
58:19 figured out exactly all the Rd on how to
58:21 do it you need to pay for it
58:22 but you're an expert at that and I will
58:24 pay for this variable within the
58:26 business model but some people have no
58:29 business model at all I've been inside
58:30 of startups in the last 12 months we're
58:34 very good friend of mine is trying to
58:35 raise money for a project and the weird
58:38 thing is I was on like I don't know a
58:41 dozen phone calls with very famous
58:43 think-tank people and I'm totally
58:46 confused about what the hell we're doing
58:47 I'm supposed to be hired as a writer and
58:49 everybody kept saying okay well what is
58:52 this product look what do what are we
58:53 doing here exactly well you know it
58:55 could be anything and it was like
58:58 whatever you want it to be you know it's
58:59 like that is not what you say if the
59:03 Duke could think up his own gig he's not
59:05 gonna share it with you unless you can
59:07 use you to realize it better and so I
59:11 see this at the adult level and I see
59:14 that the kid level but the the true
59:20 oxymoron in the country that's really
59:22 causing this is we have the worst
59:23 education we've ever had we have super
59:26 expensive degrees that are unemployable
59:28 and so every kid in America just so that
59:32 you know is getting sort of a lowbrow
59:35 version of what we used to get when I
59:36 was a kid which was the American Dream
59:38 propaganda you can be anything that you
59:41 want to be which is obviously the truth
59:43 in any country doesn't have one of these
59:45 generals in it any free country any men
59:48 just work really hard and you can get
59:50 anything to happen build up your skills
59:51 and all that kind of stuff right but now
59:55 the kids graduate high school
59:57 graduate college maybe and they don't
60:01 know anything they don't know how to get
60:03 anything and because of the internet all
60:07 those little mom-and-pop stores that
60:09 people thought they could start they
60:11 can't start anymore because this place
60:14 is being turned into an Internet
60:16 shopping spree right it's all amazon.com
60:19 there's an amazing series of videos that
60:22 are probably some of you have seen them
60:24 it's about abandoned malls some of these
60:29 guys have over a hundred thousand two
60:31 hundred thousand subscribers and all
60:33 they do and I don't mean to minimize
60:35 what they do but it's interesting they
60:38 go to these old malls they find them
60:40 they go to them nine times out of ten
60:43 they're completely abandoned every once
60:45 in a while to be a couple functioning
60:47 stores out of like 50 stores and they're
60:51 showing you the ramifications of online
60:54 shopping and I thought it would be
60:58 because Toys R Us is actually coming
61:00 back which as a you know I never went
61:02 there much cuz my family was broke when
61:05 I was a kid and by the time I got old
61:07 enough I there's nothing in the store I
61:08 really want but it makes me happy the
61:12 kids can go find things that are really
61:14 educational or creative right Legos or
61:17 whatever it is right but they're coming
61:21 back to the malls but I thought how
61:23 funny would it be or ironic or as a
61:25 demonstration if you had a good retail
61:28 successful retail place you take like a
61:30 twenty by twenty room out of your retail
61:32 space like say the size of like a super
61:34 Walmart or something and you put
61:36 everything in there behind Plexiglas and
61:40 it says there's just barcodes everywhere
61:43 and this is your internet shopping area
61:46 in the store but it behind the Plexiglas
61:49 is all the fun stuff the toys and the
61:52 Legos and the books and all that stuff's
61:55 behind glass and it the examples to say
61:58 you can't touch any of this stuff oh
62:01 maybe there's some screenshots that are
62:04 printed out but it shows you how
62:07 unengaging and how uninteresting
62:11 in how uninformative it is to shop
62:14 online and so what's happening and we've
62:18 all done this you go to the retailer you
62:21 find their product that you like and
62:22 then you go online and buy it because
62:26 the retailer is selling it to you for
62:27 something ridiculous price I just had to
62:29 buy a roll of copper foil as part of
62:33 fixing my laptop well at the local store
62:37 it's 25 bucks and someone is already
62:40 like pulled off the first six inches and
62:43 rounded up because I don't know what the
62:44 hell they're doing and I try to find all
62:47 the other ones sort of on a clean one so
62:48 I can get the you local retailer the
62:50 money they're all messed up the guy
62:52 won't knock down any price on this thing
62:53 I'm like look at least a foot of this
62:55 thing is destroyed you want to pay full
62:58 price for this protect it a little bit
63:00 better would you I found online for 11
63:02 bucks now the only reason why one online
63:06 is because I have to get a bunch of
63:07 components the store doesn't carry
63:08 because they can't afford to carry
63:10 absolutely everything on planet Earth
63:11 like really fine copper wire and SMD
63:16 rectifiers they don't sell any SM DS at
63:18 stores that only sell like the normal
63:20 diodes with the the you know the depends
63:22 out of them or I should say the wires
63:25 I bought some epoxy at the store high
63:29 high temperature epoxy it was like this
63:32 stuff melts so probably about a hundred
63:34 degrees you couldn't you couldn't glue a
63:35 handle on to a coffee mug before it
63:38 would fall off it was just absolute crap
63:40 so no one in Orange County carries it I
63:43 got to go online we're all guilty of
63:45 this thing but this is destroying the
63:50 retail outlets which then destroy a ton
63:52 of people's dreams and because the
63:57 second tier of what's going on is sort
63:59 of the globalism issue and there
64:01 definitely has to be adjustments to
64:02 society but we make something really
64:06 cool if I make an invention here in the
64:08 United States of America and I patent it
64:10 and I get it made by myself or by people
64:13 in America and the Chinese see it well
64:16 Chinese has a whole US a whole
64:18 documentary on this they have a whole
64:19 division in their government that is a
64:21 sign to stealing IP
64:25 that's what they do alright so they
64:27 knock it off over there and they ship it
64:30 in and they're a complete violation of
64:32 copyright you go to the retailer and you
64:34 try to protest they're here to say we
64:35 have to take it up with them we don't
64:37 know that this is illegal you have an
64:39 injunction this is we can't sell this
64:40 well not yet
64:41 what do you think that lawsuits gonna
64:43 cost you you know
64:44 let's see your your startup is only
64:47 making maybe twenty thousand dollars a
64:50 month but your lawsuit over there's
64:51 gonna be two million bucks and they're
64:53 winning every day over you so far a
64:56 little bit of comfort we're losing our
64:58 destinies and these poor kids and I do
65:02 say poor kids even though they're
65:04 annoying is [ __ ] all men but not being
65:08 taught the Constitution they're not
65:10 being taught all the villains of the
65:11 world right you know I haven't been to
65:13 school in 30 years but I have to say I'm
65:16 willing to bet if I were to reset you
65:18 know going through some like the movie
65:21 toy and I'm shrunk down to a little kid
65:22 and I go through I don't know seven
65:25 through senior year I'm pretty sure I'm
65:27 never gonna get taught in one Tesla and
65:29 compound interest but the other thing
65:31 I'm never gonna get taught is about
65:32 Mount Saint Tong and Stalin and Pol Pot
65:35 and all the Mussolini's and in Hitler's
65:40 maybe I'll learn Hitler right because
65:41 there's an agenda by learning about that
65:43 guy but they never tell they probably
65:45 won't tell me at the same time they're
65:46 telling me about these folks that
65:47 socialism was first to go and grab was
65:49 second and then tyranny and a dictator
65:51 came third but what is the what's the
65:55 irony of the Democratic Party they keep
65:59 calling Trump a dictator they keep
66:01 saying Trump hangs out with dictators
66:02 because he's trying to solve problems
66:04 with these dictators she's a dictator in
66:08 China he is Eve said he's gonna be
66:11 president till he dies well that sounds
66:13 pretty much like a dictator to me so
66:16 what makes him different than Kim
66:17 jung-ho
66:18 well makes him different than Putin
66:20 Putin said he'll be president till he
66:21 dies too until he hands it over okay
66:25 what's the difference those are
66:28 individuals that the Democrats will
66:30 support through various means meaning
66:33 they will support Putin because he's
66:34 supposedly the bad guy obviously won't
66:36 support kim jeong-hoon because he's been
66:37 taken over by the
66:38 clowns of America which is a reference
66:41 to another alphabet agency but just like
66:44 Rick Gervase said during the Golden
66:49 Globes he goes to Tim Cook he says look
66:51 your virtue is signaling through your
66:53 new Apple streaming service but you're a
66:55 company that has your phones made by
66:56 slave labor in China so kind of shut the
67:01 [ __ ] up and you're literally exploiting
67:05 people in a foreign country so that you
67:07 can make ridiculous profit margins on
67:10 these phones guarantee you any of the
67:12 phones you get from Apple I would
67:14 imagine that they're $2,500 phone at the
67:17 absolute maximum and I'm willing to bet
67:20 I'm nearly doubling the price of what
67:23 they're getting it for cost I would say
67:26 the core parts inside of $2,500 phone
67:28 probably run Apple 150 bucks labor
67:32 nothing nothing at all and who's the big
67:37 virtuous ailing signaling corporation in
67:39 this planet Apple alright again how the
67:44 Board of Directors rationalizes this
67:47 this move is ridiculous obviously
67:49 they're trying to tell the Board of
67:50 Directors hey this is great we have a
67:52 bunch of fanboys for reason a and so
67:55 they buy our products over here for
67:56 reason B but there we've bound them
67:58 together right they feel like if they
68:00 have an iPhone they're standing up for
68:03 the world you know it's like are you
68:05 crazy
68:06 it'd be interesting to take and run a
68:09 contest to find the biggest Apple
68:10 fanboys on planet earth right and then
68:14 they get that guy that does the singing
68:16 karaoke and he ripped off my friend
68:18 Robert Llewellyn with his show carpool
68:20 but he doesn't see any karaoke in the
68:22 car
68:23 right so it's carpool karaoke thing take
68:25 that guy and send him over to the sweat
68:30 factories in China send him over to the
68:34 prison camps in China where people get
68:36 their organs harvested against their
68:38 will I haven't watched the whole process
68:42 horrify this guy with what he is so sure
68:46 there's a big feather in his cap with
68:49 the big G OD when he dies
68:51 I mean there was a documentary made by
68:56 Vice where this older journalist went to
69:00 North Korea before Trump was in office
69:02 of course it was the access to evil at
69:04 the time and he spends quite a bit of
69:07 time over there and he sees the fact
69:09 that all the males are conscripted into
69:13 military service so every single one of
69:16 them knows how to work a gun knows how
69:18 to drive whatever vehicles they have
69:20 it's all ancient stuff it's no threat to
69:22 United States but there's nothing like a
69:24 hand-to-hand combat training there's
69:26 nothing like being able to use a gun
69:28 being a dagger all that stuff and they
69:31 may not you know they're not remotely as
69:32 weltering desired military in modern
69:34 world but he then comes back over to the
69:38 southern South Korea and there's a scene
69:41 where he looks around and he kind of
69:43 whispers to the cameras something to the
69:44 effect of if not exactly he goes he goes
69:47 man if they came if they decided to
69:49 invade South Korea this place would fall
69:50 in a day and his mindset is to say none
69:55 of these kids know how to fight none of
69:57 these kids know anything about hardship
69:59 and just across the DMZ are some of the
70:02 most hardcore Asian guys on planet Earth
70:06 right this is something that should be
70:08 recognized about China as well
70:09 China has a tremendously huge army and
70:12 they haven't fought a war against anyone
70:14 else for quite a while we'll take the
70:17 Nanking Massacre and give it special
70:21 treatment which was then being taken
70:24 over by the Japanese and to say one of
70:28 the weirdest things about World War two
70:31 history is that you will go all the way
70:33 through American school and you will
70:34 never be taught about the massacres of
70:36 Nanking and if I say that word and
70:39 you're like well I don't know what
70:40 you're talking about don't feel bad but
70:43 then go up on YouTube and watch a
70:45 documentary that's at least over 45
70:47 minutes and I will say you need to be a
70:51 person with a strong stomach because it
70:55 will leave you with visions that you
70:58 know unless you abuse animals it will
71:02 leave you with visions that will haunt
71:03 you
71:04 for a long time what happened in Nanking
71:08 utterly blows away anything that
71:10 happened in any concentration camp
71:12 anywhere and that's no joke and that's I
71:15 know what I'm saying it's a big claim
71:17 just go watch it and the weird thing is
71:19 they took photographs and they took
71:21 movies and you know it was you just
71:25 don't even know what happened to the
71:26 Japanese something just crawled into
71:29 their brain they all became savages and
71:31 what's strange about is that now that we
71:32 know Japan in the modern world it really
71:35 doesn't make any sense
71:36 you know but supposedly there was a
71:38 general in the Japanese army that was
71:42 very very brutal and they now attribute
71:45 a lot of this mentality that made
71:49 Nanking possible to this guy really one
71:54 you know sort of training them to think
71:57 that Chinese people weren't even human
71:59 is one of the root one of the theories I
72:02 should say and that you know you could
72:03 do anything you wanted with them that it
72:05 was just was unbelievable so a lot of
72:10 the darkness from our past isn't taught
72:12 to Americans in general and so of course
72:16 we also have the although it's
72:18 completely different and it probably
72:21 since this cue and on guy started
72:22 posting in late 2017 we have an
72:26 awakening that is measurable that is
72:29 unbelievable and so now we've got again
72:32 tons of YouTube channels that are trying
72:34 to keep it real and that's super healthy
72:37 for us because now we're starting to
72:39 learn about the propaganda that we have
72:41 heard you know this whole thing of
72:43 hating Russia just really pisses me off
72:46 and I didn't I did an episode called
72:50 fake enemies and they demonetized it
72:52 because in that episode I said look you
72:54 know and I had a good friend of mine he
72:56 was very smart and I said she was
72:58 complaining about the fact that you know
73:00 Trump talks to Putin and it was this
73:01 whole hate Russia hate Russia thing and
73:03 I'm sitting there going look look why do
73:05 you still buy into that 1980s and Beyond
73:09 propaganda about Russia it's not the
73:12 1950s anymore Khrushchev is not the
73:15 president anymore
73:17 they're on the other side of the world
73:19 we don't mess with them they don't mess
73:22 with us and that's the truth but now
73:24 they're being blown up again like this
73:26 cold war thing was literally restarted
73:28 the second that Trump got in office and
73:30 now they're blaming you know again the
73:32 Russians for throwing the election I
73:34 mean what a crock of crap again let's
73:37 just say I've said this a recent episode
73:39 but just think about it you're here and
73:42 you're a Democrat you're here in your
73:44 Republican what ad on Facebook's got to
73:48 change your mind and people like to run
73:50 that theory Williams the undecided on
73:52 the fence it's like they're gonna listen
73:55 to Donald Trump talk they're gonna
73:56 listen to Pelosi talk and aoc talk and
73:59 shift talk and they're gonna make their
74:00 decision about what party they want to
74:01 be involved in they're gonna watch
74:03 Elizabeth Warren collect millions of
74:06 dollars in Harvard educational professor
74:10 fees claiming she was part Cherokee you
74:14 know as I've been told by my Native
74:16 American friends you can't test for
74:17 Cherokee blood because it matches other
74:19 other Native American factions but she
74:23 comes up 1024 which is nothing so she
74:27 lied and then she doubled down the line
74:29 making some infomercial buy house she
74:31 had her blood checked and the blood that
74:33 she came with positive for at one
74:36 thousand twenty fourth which is nothing
74:37 is some Peruvian Fang way down south
74:40 which is obviously an irregularity in
74:43 the blood that happened to match someone
74:45 else
74:45 she's as white as a ghost but no one's
74:49 gonna change your mind if you're stuck
74:51 on those issues the candidates
74:53 themselves will change your minds and
74:54 that's the only way it works you know I
74:58 haven't heard anyone say that Russia
74:59 hacked into George Soros is voting
75:03 machines I haven't heard that I haven't
75:04 any decent claims at all about how it
75:06 works but I hear it on both sides of the
75:07 fence on t well we know that Russia did
75:10 this it's like no you don't know and
75:11 you're full of [ __ ] and you're just
75:13 pandering to the agenda so just from one
75:19 American to everybody else in the world
75:22 we do have our utterly delusional
75:25 coddled people who are
75:29 a lot of them are being supported by
75:31 their parents having never had a job you
75:33 know everybody goes through hardships
75:35 and you need your parents everyone some
75:37 lot of kicking if you still got them and
75:38 it can still help you that happens and
75:40 that's a whole different scenario
75:42 you're trying right you were on top and
75:44 then on bottom whatever but some of
75:47 these kids and it's honestly it's not
75:49 their fault that they're uninformed that
75:51 they're under undereducated they have a
75:53 massive debt
75:55 you know the was it the impeachment
75:58 trial I think has cost us well when they
76:02 added up all the fake dossier paying and
76:05 all this other stuff trying to frame
76:06 turnout for something you never did
76:08 plus the the Buller investigation I
76:11 think we're up to 150 million dollars of
76:13 taxpayer money being spent on these
76:15 [ __ ] democratic-led agendas and then
76:20 you take all of their salaries which
76:22 start at 147 I think and go all the way
76:25 up I mean I don't even know what the
76:27 highest person is paid they're not doing
76:29 anything for the country at all right
76:30 they're not they're not voting for
76:32 anything I mean you know they recently
76:34 put forth a vote for this trade
76:37 agreement we have which with Canada and
76:39 Mexico because they absolutely have to
76:42 but when you add it up you're probably I
76:45 would assume 300 million dollars or so
76:48 wasted with this party that's 3,000
76:53 college degrees that could have been
76:54 paid for in full 3000 they could have at
76:59 least given these kids a chance say okay
77:01 we're gonna wipe away all your debt in
77:03 fact we're gonna even wipe off the
77:04 interest before we wipe away your debt
77:06 therefore you don't have a hundred
77:08 thousand dollar loan you actually got a
77:09 sixty thousand dollar loan and so we're
77:11 gonna pay for four thousand degrees but
77:16 what is the promise from the same party
77:18 oh we're going to pay for all this stuff
77:21 free medical coverage free education
77:24 free free free free free which is you
77:26 know immediately in the trillions of
77:28 dollars won't you start adding it up and
77:30 even even if we got price breaks you're
77:32 probably at a few trillion money we
77:35 don't have but the country is is sort of
77:38 like the the Conservatives with
77:41 is really at this point it takes nothing
77:43 to be a conservative if you were a
77:45 normal Democrat in America right now you
77:49 would be considered a conservative from
77:52 these radical aoc nut banks right but
77:55 you just say the Constitution is
77:57 directly in the middle between right and
77:59 left because it doesn't have any bias it
78:01 is you have these inalienable rights
78:02 because this country was found on a
78:04 republic meaning if the whole country
78:07 voted against the freedom of speech you
78:10 still have it because this is where the
78:13 Constitution works you get these rights
78:15 because you're alive
78:16 well we tolerated crazy to see if it
78:20 would blow over some of a blue over you
78:23 know like black lives matter seemed to
78:25 calm down a little bit again with Candis
78:28 Owens with the black suit project and
78:31 the walk away hashtag walk away it has
78:34 had a significant impact on this
78:36 craziness here but we still have you
78:39 know all of our climate change horseshit
78:41 you know and you know Greta oh my god
78:44 you know the the fact that these folks
78:46 fall hook line and sinker for this chick
78:48 it just blows my mind right but now
78:52 we're starting to fight back the
78:54 president has started to fight back the
78:55 intelligence agencies and the heads of
78:58 the DOJ are starting to fight back so we
79:00 have an attorney general fighting but
79:01 fighting back we have durum fighting
79:02 back and reporting to the AG so we have
79:06 I think that's correct we have quite a
79:09 few voices on the internet that didn't
79:11 exist two or three years ago I mean
79:13 there's guys out there I've had the show
79:15 for five years I am so [ __ ] it
79:17 totally ganked by their censorship is
79:20 unbelievable I just posted on the
79:22 Facebook group kiss you guys don't have
79:24 a subscription to that I will get ten
79:27 subscriptions in a day and the next
79:29 morning nine of them are gone if not all
79:31 10 of them are gone today I was like
79:35 refreshing my feed and it was like five
79:38 people gone and I was like holy [ __ ] you
79:40 know but the stats on the statistics I'm
79:43 blowing up like in terms of the amount
79:45 of video watch this movie ever started
79:47 this movie this channel has been watched
79:49 45 years right
79:52 so you add up all the minutes on just
79:54 you
79:55 245 years I've at least got I don't know
80:00 I conservative estimate probably half of
80:04 that in podcast that you could add to
80:06 those 45 years and so the show is
80:08 getting watch like crazy the average
80:10 watch time used to be in low 20s and now
80:15 it's the high 30s meaning the average
80:17 video gets watched 38 minutes now before
80:19 someone pauses to go do something else
80:21 and then come back and watch the second
80:22 half but we're fighting back now and so
80:26 the other thing I want to communicate
80:28 because I was just hearing about you
80:31 know just just hearing the reactions and
80:33 reading tons of reactions online about
80:35 this whole Iranian situation because
80:38 everyone gets all you know worried about
80:40 World War 3 and it's just not going to
80:41 happen they don't want it
80:42 the reason why I rom will never do it is
80:44 because it will force a regime change
80:46 one we would win that war and we win it
80:50 mostly from the air and it would
80:53 probably result in simply us kneeling
80:56 there their regime which is illegal I
80:58 think but you know it would happen in
81:01 World War three I mean because we didn't
81:02 in that [ __ ] as soon as possible right
81:04 and I don't think Russia would want any
81:06 of that craziness to happen so they'd
81:07 probably Lobby in there and go you just
81:08 need to defuse this thing which is
81:11 probably what actually ended up taking
81:12 place but you know there's a bunch of I
81:16 even have one of my listeners post he
81:19 listed a whole list of things the
81:22 previous leaders to trump have done to
81:25 create this horrible situation that
81:27 America's in and then he blamed Trump
81:29 for them I was like what the [ __ ] is
81:31 wrong with you men right so I get to go
81:35 to your family tree and every [ __ ]
81:38 scumbag in your family tree I get to say
81:39 there's probably only just a few of them
81:41 right but I believe everyone up your
81:43 family tree for every bad apple that
81:45 ever ended up if you blame me for what
81:47 my cousin did and the life
81:49 you would never talk to me again ever
81:50 you guys such a scumbag well no one does
81:54 that so don't do it the Trump [ __ ]
81:56 sake man but I gave an analogy and I
82:00 want every American to give this analogy
82:02 and if you see what I'm saying and
82:05 you're not from America then god bless
82:06 you you can repeat this too
82:08 since okay the sixteenth amendment in
82:12 America which was passed in 1913 and for
82:15 those of you don't from are familiar
82:16 with our Constitution I totally get it
82:17 this is where they took over our money
82:19 and made a Fiat 1913 we don't make our
82:23 own money anymore but it's all fake
82:25 right it's stupid it's fake we should
82:27 make our own fake money the Federal
82:28 Reserve that we have over here is a
82:29 private for-profit bank as soon as that
82:32 happened skullenbones moved in I mean
82:34 Taft the president before Woodrow Wilson
82:36 who got it falsely ratified he was a
82:38 skullenbones he's a first skullenbones
82:40 president
82:41 they created the clowns of America and
82:43 so that was all skullenbones for 40
82:47 years you could be at the top of that
82:48 organization unless you're part of all
82:49 bones now we've had so many Skull and
82:52 Bones presidents ridiculous what they
82:55 did was the falling and I always give
82:58 this analogy think of Thor's hammer
83:00 Chris Hemsworth's prop from the movie
83:03 there's a big lump of steel a one-in and
83:06 there's that leather handle that goes
83:08 back right it's all steel but it's you
83:10 know got a leather grip on it here's how
83:13 America has rolled since 1913 which
83:17 means world war one world war two Korean
83:20 War Vietnam War Desert Storm and all
83:22 those [ __ ] has been going on since
83:24 2003 all of it the bankers because of
83:29 the complicit presidents that ran after
83:32 that picked out since 1954 mother
83:36 Bilderberg Group but don't think that
83:38 you know Roosevelt was a complete
83:39 [ __ ] chill guy get rid of everybody's
83:41 gold and send it over to the Europeans
83:44 through this [ __ ] to Fort Knox which
83:46 is named after Philander Knox and not
83:47 this Navy admiral they give you this
83:49 [ __ ] story oh but you they grab the
83:52 handle the European bankers grabbed the
83:54 handle and they look at things in the
83:57 world that need to be destroyed so they
83:59 can take over South America Africa and
84:02 Eurasia the Middle East and they take
84:06 that handle and they smash the big metal
84:09 part on the end of the handle which is
84:11 America the flag all the bodies of all
84:15 of our men and women isn't is the hammer
84:19 on the end and they smash the world
84:21 with it BAM buh-bam so when people look
84:25 up at what hit them
84:26 what's up there an American bomber an
84:29 American fighter
84:30 what's shooting at them through the door
84:32 an American soldier all these folks are
84:35 trying to do the right thing as soldiers
84:38 trying to protect our country but the
84:41 bankers instigate just like investors
84:43 right investors create investments they
84:45 don't wait around for people to come to
84:46 them and say he had an idea it's not
84:49 shark tank in the real world they make
84:52 things happen they invent medicines to
84:55 make you sick and then they buy the
84:56 hospitals to treat you they teach a
84:59 woman that she has to be lying down on
85:00 her back to have a kid otherwise she
85:02 might die but that causes breach and so
85:05 now everyone has to have serious
85:06 Assyrian when the natural way to have a
85:08 child is to squat the best if you squat
85:10 in a pool of water they invent things so
85:16 we have been the butt of this whole
85:19 thing the entire time now is if we had
85:22 another Bohemian Grove going the
85:26 bilderberg selected CFR trilateral
85:28 commission president like Obama like
85:31 Bush like Clinton like his bush senior
85:35 you know Reagan was duped I think I
85:39 think he's an actor I think he tried to
85:40 do the right thing but they shot him to
85:42 prove dude you're not in control so shut
85:46 the [ __ ] up and we'll run the show
85:48 you're vice president he's the one in
85:50 charge
85:50 he's a Bushman guy ran the CIA randomly
85:54 out of thin air
85:55 in 74 for 11 months and puked on the
85:57 Chinese President or whatever was so
86:03 just understand that we are trying to
86:06 put our sorry Trump is really really
86:09 really trying to get the handle out of
86:11 the bankers from now on you think him
86:15 pulling the troops out of Syria was easy
86:17 it's easy to give the command but all
86:20 the all the shields inside the
86:22 government I'm talking the
86:24 military-industrial complex we think
86:26 might have had a silent coup
86:29 and you just didn't hear about it
86:31 meaning they got rid of all their little
86:33 shills inside now Tripp is trying to
86:36 draining the swamp what did you think
86:38 was gonna happen did you think it was
86:40 all gonna be some cake in a tutu moment
86:43 some peaceful Accord well Pelosi it's
86:46 time for you to leave and put these
86:48 handcuffs on because you're gonna take a
86:49 trip to Cuba not the cigar Cuba but the
86:53 Guantanamo Bay Cuba no it's not the way
86:58 it works they're fighting back and
87:01 they've got nothing absolutely nothing
87:04 so they're trying to keep nothing going
87:07 forever remember the Russian collusion
87:09 was the nothing burger well that's
87:11 exactly what it turned out to be nothing
87:13 burger all that dossier [ __ ] all faked
87:16 by a guy who's that [ __ ] washed-up
87:18 alcoholic mi6 dude Jeff so we're in a
87:21 really tumultuous stage in this country
87:24 but the good news is we are now doubling
87:28 down on our Constitution like never
87:30 before
87:30 the value of the Constitution has never
87:33 been so apparent to so many citizens of
87:35 the United States probably since I don't
87:38 know I don't know where we actually lost
87:40 grip with our Constitution we didn't
87:42 care about it anymore it may be because
87:44 of great decades like perhaps the 80s
87:48 you know I don't know maybe the
87:50 distraction of the 90s would you have
87:52 the Internet explosion maybe the 2000s
87:54 where it's kind of like oh we need to
87:57 have the Fourth Amendment permanently
87:59 violated I don't know what we do about
88:02 the Fourth Amendment in this country how
88:04 didn't if i sat down with with donald
88:06 trump right now the biggest question i
88:09 want to ask the guy is what are you
88:12 gonna do to restore the Fourth Amendment
88:14 he's dropping I know you're listening to
88:17 all my phone calls I know you're
88:19 grabbing all my text messages and all my
88:20 emails I know you want that information
88:22 because it allows the second you stop
88:25 looking at all that stuff well then in
88:26 your brain everyone's colluding against
88:28 you so this is basically the modern
88:30 stamp tax I get to look at every piece
88:32 of paper in your house because if you're
88:34 gonna cabal against the queen or the
88:36 king that's we're gonna do you're gonna
88:38 write down your plan and then we'll find
88:40 it because we have to put a little stamp
88:41 on every piece of paper
88:42 that's that's a real thing back in
88:44 history go look it up the stamp tax it
88:46 will blow your mind
88:47 that the citizens of England allowed
88:50 there to be a stamp tax you know I think
88:54 man is actually fairly a fairly
88:57 terrified creature
88:58 I think we're scared constantly because
89:03 there's always some bully you know I
89:06 think that it's it's interesting you
89:10 know we want to protect ourselves and
89:13 our our loved ones from from bad
89:16 experiences but you ask any kid that had
89:20 to grow up in fistfights and you have
89:22 something a lot bigger than you coming
89:24 at you and you're not sure what's gonna
89:26 happen and even though you're young and
89:27 you have this outlet forever sort of
89:29 thing and you get punched by someone
89:32 who's got a fist as big as your head you
89:35 will rethink your life a little bit and
89:38 once you get you know dominated it'll
89:42 it'll change your mind a little bit
89:43 about like okay you know like LL Cool J
89:46 he got really buff because there was a
89:48 attempted murder on his mother and his
89:50 grandfather his house and so he was like
89:54 he was 12 or something he read his book
89:56 you'll find all about this stuff but he
89:58 got really buff because he was like I am
89:59 never going to be caught unsafe again
90:04 unable to defend myself right well you
90:09 know there was a point you'll see old
90:11 movies where effect what was I was
90:13 looking at the Maltese Falcon movie
90:17 right and if you haven't seen that movie
90:20 it's about a Maltese Falcon statuette
90:24 thing it's a little Black Falcon it's
90:26 about the size of a vase with flowers in
90:29 it and it was for whatever reason was a
90:32 guy chased it for 17 years I think is
90:34 the number Humphrey Bogart plays a
90:37 detective who's got a woman that comes
90:39 in and doesn't malign a crap about
90:41 something and he kind of senses that
90:43 she's full of crap but there's all this
90:45 back and forth between Humphrey Bogart
90:47 and the local police because they know
90:50 he's up to something
90:51 they think he's maybe up to some shady
90:53 stuff people end up dying in the movie
90:55 and the
90:56 to him and they try to muscle him a
90:57 little bit but he muscles back the cops
90:59 and the interesting thing is is that in
91:02 that era of the 30s I think it was in
91:06 the 30s
91:08 cops were good overall right at least it
91:11 rate on TV as being you know a
91:12 law-abiding the police officers and
91:15 today you could never push a script like
91:17 that because you know you lip off to a
91:19 cop and there's no one looking because
91:21 they have little cam on his chest we'll
91:23 just do whatever the hell he wants
91:24 because he he's making his own judgments
91:26 as to whether or not you're being a dick
91:28 you know and so sometimes we might even
91:31 support that kind of behavior because
91:34 you have to fight fire with fire
91:35 sometimes but all that's gone all that's
91:40 gone nobody trusts anybody and so you
91:46 know it's it's you know I was funny
91:49 because I have friends running for the
91:52 Senate and one of the interesting things
91:54 about that process is that they're going
91:56 to try and corner my friend on issues to
91:59 try and get them to piss off enough
92:01 people that they won't win that's gonna
92:03 be the game and we've talked about this
92:05 a little bit in other episodes but think
92:07 about it if the subject of say abortion
92:09 gets brought up because that's always
92:11 thing and of course if you're remotely
92:13 conservative you're pro-life ER but
92:15 there's always conditions to pro-life
92:16 you know they're not insane there are
92:19 reasons why they might support it in a
92:23 really contingency situation but you
92:25 know people killing a nine month old kid
92:28 after it's born in Virginia is just
92:29 insane right but what they'll try to do
92:32 is get you on that edge and one of the
92:36 tactics back is simply to say look pick
92:39 any church in America any church in
92:42 America give this analogy over one small
92:44 but this is really important okay cuz
92:46 this will really show you the frailty of
92:49 the human mind go to the front pew of
92:52 any church we have you're really
92:54 enthusiastic goers right because they're
92:56 sitting right in the front rows no one
92:57 is sitting in front of them and you know
93:01 pick a subject pick a subject in the
93:03 Bible and go how do you interpret this
93:05 you know letter to Corinthians where
93:07 Paul says that women said
93:09 shut the [ __ ] up and talk to their
93:10 husbands before they're allowed to talk
93:12 to the church okay most of us think that
93:15 that passage was inserted even if it was
93:18 inserted we think it was because women's
93:20 education was so subdued that perhaps
93:23 you know it might be best if they did go
93:26 through their educated husband it's a
93:27 it's a timely thing at best doesn't
93:30 apply to today well if you're a woman
93:33 and especially got a Mormon Church women
93:36 can actually preach there's a few you
93:38 know divisions that allow that to happen
93:39 and you go what do you think about that
93:41 is it wrong is it wrong that you're not
93:45 supposed to be up there and it says
93:46 right there and then you Testament not
93:47 supposed to be up there and just
93:50 you'll start dividing just one person
93:52 down yet you'll ask him to was Genesis a
93:55 hundred percent literal that all those
93:59 things happen because it retails the
94:01 first story a couple times and you know
94:03 man is first the animals and animals are
94:05 first and man okay which ones right and
94:09 they'll start disagreeing down the Pew
94:12 okay but then you go look
94:14 can you still come by here next Sunday
94:17 and worship God together and feel good
94:19 and sing him and all that good stuff
94:20 oh yeah sure yeah it's like okay then
94:24 you know how the world works down we're
94:27 not all on the same page as much as we'd
94:29 love to be on the same page let's say
94:31 that all these crazy Democrats are going
94:32 if y'all get pushed out of office and
94:35 the only ones that are left are your
94:36 normal Democrats that just have a little
94:38 bit of a liberal thinking process power
94:40 to them you know we it's good to see
94:42 both sides of all fences right the true
94:45 racist ones are gone the normal ones are
94:48 left like you're like our relatives are
94:50 usually not radicals they're just just a
94:53 little bit left that's all okay can we
94:56 coexist can we be together in one
94:59 country can we be together at the dinner
95:00 table can we celebrate Christmas and
95:02 Thanksgiving and all these other place
95:04 these are their holidays of course we
95:06 can but you know just getting towards in
95:10 this episode you know one of the things
95:12 this most frustrating as a citizen of
95:14 America and I have no claim over any
95:16 other country
95:18 and I say it all the time which is that
95:21 it happens on both sides of the fence
95:24 but what's interesting is is that what I
95:27 see from my perspective living in
95:30 Southern California and smoking in a
95:31 lounge which has tons of guys coming in
95:33 now and again we're mostly conservative
95:35 here but we're not crazy
95:37 we're not coke brothers enthusiasts
95:39 we're not Carlyle Group enthusiasts you
95:43 know we're not you know Halliburton
95:44 lovers they Tibbett to just stand on the
95:49 Constitution that's what we do and so
95:51 that gets everyone generally in the
95:52 conservative style on the same page
95:54 really quick while they'll just say most
95:57 people start to probably last three
96:00 years that I know if you say well what
96:02 party you're part of and they go yeah
96:03 well I'm not really part of any party
96:05 and then I say them well me neither I'm
96:07 usually I'm just really a
96:08 constitutionalist they go yeah exactly
96:10 that that's what I am constitutionalist
96:12 you know left or right anymore you're
96:13 standing dead center it's awesome
96:15 do no harm that's really the basic law
96:17 of the world but what happens with my
96:20 left friends that are more of the
96:21 concerning left is that they're standing
96:25 on top of scene in headlines they'll
96:29 believe in climate change and I say well
96:30 how what's the percentage of co2 in the
96:32 greenhouse gas index they have no idea
96:35 not a clue and when you tell him I just
96:38 recently told a friend of mine who I
96:39 love her to death and she just looked at
96:41 me and shook her head she didn't say
96:43 anything she just looked at me shook her
96:44 head I was like well you can't deny
96:48 what's true I got my information from
96:50 the head meteorologists at MIT okay this
96:54 guy wrong he's got a PhD in this he's
96:56 been teaching it for over 30 years is he
96:59 wrong no he's not cuz he's backed up by
97:02 everybody else that says this is
97:03 [ __ ] man-made climate change oh yeah
97:06 it's called chemtrails it's called
97:08 geoengineering
97:09 it's called stratospheric aerosol right
97:13 you want to know why force just burn up
97:15 in the middle of nowhere
97:16 well human beings are light in the match
97:17 of course let's not forget that
97:20 Australia they Kim calm who's turning to
97:23 a complete commie I don't what the
97:25 hell's wrong with this dude he posted
97:27 the fake picture of Australia burning
97:29 which is the whole island burning with
97:31 cotton
97:31 sorry mountain ranges and volcanoes in
97:33 this picture that do not exist in real
97:35 life the reality was it's it's a
97:39 significant portion but it's down by
97:41 Queensland it's this little strip down
97:43 there well we got three of you that are
97:45 in Australia who are some of our
97:46 greatest contributors our listeners came
97:49 back and said yeah I called around and
97:51 everyone's asking me why they're worried
97:53 about me when fires I'm like the fires
97:55 are by human they're not not even in my
97:58 area I don't know if it was the listener
98:00 or a friend of mine someone just
98:02 recently told me that they called their
98:04 friends in New Zealand and said can you
98:05 see the fire smoke coming over New
98:07 Zealand they were like no we are you
98:09 okay weird the whole place is on fire
98:11 well just as a little digression so you
98:14 could put this in your little quiver of
98:15 facts
98:17 aluminum oxide sprayed inside chemtrails
98:19 again confirmed by dr. Russell Blaylock
98:22 retired neurologist and Dane and all
98:25 these other guys that study it Dane is
98:27 the one that broke this story as a
98:28 matter of fact I keep forgetting his
98:30 last name just look up Dane chemtrails
98:32 you'll find his website dues he's a
98:35 scientist who was twenty to six hundred
98:38 acres up to Shasta Mountain Mount Shasta
98:42 he proved that the acidity of all the
98:46 plants on his 2,600 acres was going from
98:49 like negative six point three to six
98:50 point seven to zero once that happens
98:55 you got a huge problem all the plants
98:58 start dying from within systemically
99:00 begin plants drink from the roots up and
99:02 so when you screw up the soil you screw
99:05 up what they're drinking and they start
99:06 dying from the inside out
99:08 well light it on fire see what happens
99:11 if any of you've ever burned a
99:13 tumbleweed and for those of you have it
99:16 let me tell you all about them there's
99:17 this crazy bush and they naturally die
99:21 and hardened into this kind of weird
99:23 driftwood but their Bush it's really
99:26 strange they get hard as a rock if you
99:29 were to take one of the tumbleweeds and
99:31 break one of their branches off and look
99:33 down inside of them it's - it's a it's a
99:36 hollow inside
99:37 and so when you light them on fire it's
99:40 an amazing thing you know I told this
99:41 story once before when I first came to
99:43 California we used to always go to the
99:45 can do bonfires and stuff but we'd bring
99:48 wood or we'd find real wood but we heard
99:52 this party going on once probably tenth
99:55 of a mile down the beach they're all
99:57 yelling and screaming but they're it's
99:59 totally black down there we're like what
100:00 the hell and we got our fire started
100:03 normal campfire and we heard from this
100:07 guy I was like can we have some of your
100:08 fire and we're like yeah great yeah come
100:12 on over we're all like teenagers and
100:14 this guy comes with a 10-foot radius I'm
100:18 not even kidding mint tumbleweed he had
100:20 it on his head
100:21 absolutely gigantic and he just tipped
100:24 his head down that sinks 10 feet so it
100:27 starts to burn on fire and then he's
100:29 hopping down the beach and it was the
100:30 funniest thing seeing this ball of fire
100:32 hopped down the beach and then just
100:33 before it burns him he throws it onto
100:35 this pile and they had made I don't know
100:37 15 20 foot pile of a bunch of
100:40 tumbleweeds and they had this roaring
100:42 flame up into the air I don't know 50
100:46 hundred feet just blazing hot tornado
100:48 and then nothing because it it all
100:50 burned up so if you're looking up and
100:55 you see tons of chemtrails over your
100:56 area and then you have a forest fire
100:58 well guess what one causes the other is
101:01 it man-made
101:02 yes it's man-made if they spray over
101:05 your area and get rid of the clouds then
101:07 whatever happens as a result of that
101:09 spring is man-made they can also spray
101:12 in curry clouds they can also spray in
101:14 augment hurricanes
101:16 I think dr. Judy woods has talked about
101:20 this but a lot of people have talked
101:21 about this and so they are rushing to to
101:25 create fake statistics or real
101:29 statistics with fake mechanisms
101:31 artificial mechanisms so they can get
101:33 this carbon taxation thing in before
101:37 anyone like Trump and the US military
101:39 who is now not against the Constitution
101:42 to get them to pass all this stuff I'm
101:46 getting right now in my house you know
101:48 carbon taxation email credits I've done
101:51 such a good job you're so good with your
101:53 you know carbon credits you know I want
101:57 to just tell these guys to go
101:59 themselves but you know if I sent the
102:00 email back that wanted us go anywhere
102:02 but if I made a phone call I'm talking
102:03 to some poor person on this other phone
102:05 there's no idea about agenda21 or the
102:10 fact that this stuff's all fake but
102:12 people always love a crisis they do you
102:16 know they want to they want to there's
102:17 this weird thing it's very golden oh
102:20 we're a little off track but this is
102:22 just all important stuff you've seen
102:25 this in your lifetime and maybe you've
102:27 even done this in your lifetime without
102:28 make it well but one you have to because
102:31 you have to inform people about bad news
102:33 sometimes but if let's just take away
102:36 the ones that are personal right so then
102:38 your family's passed away and you've got
102:39 to pass the information around it's some
102:42 outside thing and you go well have you
102:45 heard of this you're walking in a room
102:47 and maybe you get attention or maybe you
102:49 don't get attention but the second
102:51 you've got really bad news to talk about
102:53 and you're the most informed bad news
102:54 person in the room well what happens you
102:58 become the center of attention don't you
102:59 well what happened next
103:01 what what happened this fact this fact
103:03 this fact that's why when I make these
103:06 shows I don't want to you know milk
103:09 agendas everybody rushed online to say
103:12 who's posting again I could have done
103:14 that everyone is you know I probably
103:15 have like a ton of money in the bank and
103:17 ton of subscribers I got to meet my god
103:20 one day and I'm not gonna do it that way
103:22 right
103:23 so if you guys make a lot of requests
103:25 for something I'll do it to serve my
103:28 audience because you're interested maybe
103:30 you don't have time to research things
103:32 so I'll go grab that information but I
103:34 cringe every single time I make an
103:36 episode that I believe is looks like
103:38 clickbait just bothers me I want to
103:42 stand up on its own you know level of
103:45 information integrity if you will so I
103:48 think climate change has a lot of that
103:49 action you know you don't wanna report a
103:52 bunch of horrible stuff
103:54 but I have heard friends of mine say
103:56 things that aren't even true right they
104:00 will say things that are like well have
104:01 you heard of this crisis and it's some
104:03 absolute bunch of [ __ ] and it's even
104:07 sometimes it's there I've gotta hate I
104:11 can't even say one cuz often to one of
104:13 my friends but there are things that are
104:15 being propagated as like this super
104:18 urgent thing and we'll so I give you the
104:22 archetype of the conversation which was
104:24 thing gets reported as the most critical
104:26 thing in the entire world that no one's
104:28 paying attention to and then we said
104:31 because I'm sitting in a room with a
104:32 person that worked on the solution and
104:34 has experienced the solution several
104:37 times I said well that's not really a
104:38 problem because the man has invented
104:39 machines to fix that problem
104:41 and the other person said no no no those
104:45 machines have never been invented
104:46 they've never been turned on anywhere in
104:48 the world and it's like I don't want to
104:51 disagree with you because I love you but
104:53 yeah they have and it's been around for
104:55 probably thirty years but in the last
104:57 twenty years it's so good it's not even
105:00 an issue anymore you know we don't have
105:02 them in our country because you know
105:03 this crowd we're talking about I don't
105:05 know it's just like so it's interesting
105:08 you gotta have to bite your lip a little
105:09 bit anyway I I definitely hope this
105:13 conversation will help provide some sort
105:16 of one guy's perspective of his country
105:18 from the outside again if you can chime
105:22 in from your country and tell me what
105:24 you're experiencing and what you're
105:26 seeing the evolution especially if
105:27 you're around 50 years old there's a
105:30 great area of compatibility we had
105:32 another comment today and I don't have
105:33 my phone on me so I don't know
105:34 everybody's name but another gentleman
105:37 came to our channel and he said a great
105:39 comment for me personally he said yeah I
105:43 think it was on intellectual hatred he
105:47 said you know I have lived a very
105:49 similar life to you but I lived it in
105:51 Reverse I was in California as a young
105:53 person up to about 25 and now I believe
105:56 he's in Missouri so I moved from Kansas
105:58 to California you know I'm 17 but you
106:03 know it's the same kind of spread and so
106:05 he was saying that he was seeing what I
106:06 was talking about
106:07 in Missouri and which was in this
106:10 episode you have to watch it if you're
106:11 interested in that kind of subject
106:12 matter but it just it it's so powerful
106:15 for me to hear either a myth dismissed
106:18 or a rumor confirmed from your local
106:23 area so the more you're away from the
106:25 United States you know one I'm
106:27 interested really in two things one of
106:32 them is your perspective of the United
106:34 States and perhaps maybe there's two
106:36 sets of all the data
106:37 it's your perspective and then it's your
106:39 neighborhoods perspective you know it's
106:40 like I don't think you know maybe this
106:43 I'm playing someone from Europe let's
106:44 just say they might say I know you guys
106:47 aren't crazy but our country thinks
106:49 you're crazy so those two different
106:51 perspectives are real important and then
106:53 it's like whatever subject we're talking
106:55 about your perspective of your own
106:57 country and then your country's
106:59 perspective of your country and where
107:02 you might have some anomalies or stuff
107:03 because again you know the bummer is I
107:05 don't have the cash to fly around the
107:07 planet and really learn these things
107:08 firsthand so that I can do shows and say
107:10 oh my god I can have one of you sitting
107:12 right next to me and get you know do an
107:13 interview with you guys yes there's
107:15 there's oome and those kind of things
107:17 but there's a there's a whole different
107:20 game when I get to live in your area for
107:23 a month or something I get to see things
107:24 and you to me around and go see that
107:26 right there you don't say you're from
107:27 America this place they love you over
107:29 here that stuff has a lot of value so if
107:33 you can load up the comments I'm totally
107:35 interested and again we've not had too
107:37 many folks join the Facebook page
107:41 in the recent months so I would
107:45 definitely say that we've got a really
107:47 good group up there and that way you get
107:48 to that as we close out this episode is
107:51 to go to deep thoughts radio.com again
107:54 this is the hub of the show who is the
107:56 website so you have a search field to
107:58 look up anything that's on your mind
108:00 just put a word and you'll be amazed
108:02 sometimes there's episodes out there
108:03 because it also searches the description
108:05 in the keywords so you might find
108:07 something that you're looking for but
108:09 there's a category list of all the
108:10 episodes knocked into categories I have
108:14 a new category list which is demonetized
108:15 on youtube so you can get a chance to
108:17 see what they won't allow sometimes it's
108:19 just the name of the episode I use
108:21 if I use war they just you know it's all
108:24 it's all [ __ ] [ __ ] because if you
108:26 really think about it I watch everything
108:29 on TV through like for instance you can
108:33 watch shows now with ads right and all
108:36 of you know that right you can go to
108:37 Amazon Prime and you can watch a bunch
108:38 of shows that you normally have to rent
108:40 but you just agree to watch him with ads
108:42 well I mean goddamn they're like murder
108:45 shows and you know like even friend
108:48 which is a great fun Syfy show which I'm
108:50 gonna do it do an episode on it's got
108:53 you know
108:53 well kinds of crazy rotted bodies and
108:56 just amazing stuff it's actually a
108:59 really funny amazing show that everyone
109:01 needs to watch but so they monetize the
109:05 world monetizes everything those saying
109:07 advertisers are on YouTube like give me
109:09 a break right anyway so we have two
109:12 video feeds right now which is YouTube
109:14 and [ __ ] shoot make sure get a [ __ ]
109:16 shoot account it's more important to get
109:17 a [ __ ] choose account then you
109:18 subscribe to this channel [ __ ] shoot
109:20 just to support them we are coming on
109:23 two bright T on but again it's going to
109:24 take hundreds of views before I get my
109:26 next fifty videos and whatever they
109:29 don't help now we have all the
109:31 podcasting links you'd ever need we have
109:34 again three social media so we've got a
109:36 locked Facebook group get in have some
109:38 fun
109:38 we have Twitter which is starting to
109:41 pick up some steam I do comment every
109:43 once in a while and then we have mines
109:45 calm which is the new First Amendment
109:48 free speech zone it's better looking
109:51 than Facebook definitely would recommend
109:54 just getting an account that got a
109:55 really beautiful app on your phone I
109:56 mean it's really sexy so you know it
110:00 takes care of business we have a few
110:02 ways to donate to the page so we've got
110:04 the one-time PayPal methodology and we
110:06 have patreon what patreon gets you is
110:08 the episodes before everybody else and
110:10 in most cases it's right now we're
110:14 operating about ninety-five percent but
110:15 on a bad month it might be eighty five
110:17 percent if I'm trying to rush episodes
110:19 out real quick I will say that you know
110:21 for everybody who subscribes to patreon
110:24 which I thank you very much
110:25 most people don't click over early or
110:28 anything they just wait for things to
110:29 come out naturally so that's kind of an
110:31 interesting thing so I appreciate all of
110:32 your contributions
110:34 the other thing under the like donate
110:37 link which doesn't create any revenue
110:39 whatsoever is the brave browser and the
110:41 Backblaze backup software so definitely
110:44 switch to braze switch your search
110:45 engine to Google from Google deductr go
110:48 and then you'll be completely free of
110:50 anyone tracking your matrix about where
110:51 you want in it's guilt-free and it's way
110:54 faster than chrome the chrome was way
110:56 faster than Firefox it's fast because it
110:59 cuts all of these trackers out of your
111:01 life
111:01 all these autoplay videos it just kills
111:04 them it's beautiful you won't find any
111:07 season one on this channel because it's
111:08 all been remastered so there's a brand
111:10 new channel out there it's got no
111:12 advertising so you get the whole first
111:14 season with no advertising it's all been
111:16 edited all the audio levels have been
111:18 fixed in some cases I've cut damn near
111:21 ten minutes out of an episode because I
111:23 was sitting there thinking and I just
111:24 kept the camera rolling without editing
111:26 in so that's much much better
111:28 there's a store up there with two new
111:31 shirts for season five their UFO based
111:34 shirts one shirt comes in just one
111:37 t-shirt configuration the other shirt
111:40 says I like UFOs and it's got the UFO
111:43 from the backyard in there that one is
111:45 in all kinds of different formats so you
111:48 can get a hoodie you can get a t-shirt
111:50 and stuff so I'm gonna turn them off at
111:53 the end of the season and see will be
111:55 able to get them I am gonna be trying to
111:56 generate some new ones that are just
111:58 gonna be up there at all time so
111:59 probably a lot different than just a
112:01 deep thought shirt because I just want
112:02 to create shirts that are cool that I'd
112:04 like to wear and something that when you
112:06 put on someone's gonna ask you you know
112:10 what is that you know so that the two
112:12 new shirts have the UFO at like a
112:14 diagram schematic angle one of them has
112:18 the branding on the back one of them has
112:20 nothing on the back but in all cases
112:22 someone's gonna ask you what the hell
112:23 that sure it's all about and you get a
112:25 chance to introduce them to deep
112:26 thoughts and then you know hey
112:28 regardless if they subscribe to the show
112:30 at all you get a chance to start talking
112:32 about the cool things out there when
112:33 someone says well what the hell is deep
112:35 thoughts radio you can just go well it's
112:37 a show or it encourages you to think
112:39 about what you believe about all things
112:41 you know and it's like what subjects
112:43 does he cover and then you just start
112:45 going off so
112:47 is what I do personally when I sit down
112:50 have a cigar with some button I mean
112:52 it's interesting like one of the
112:54 scenarios that's hilarious and I hope
112:55 you guys experienced this too is I'll
112:58 sit down at my smoke lounge and there's
113:00 a new guys coming all the time they just
113:02 smoke one stick they're in town for one
113:03 week they're gone they're on vacation
113:05 they're getting away from the family or
113:06 they're on business for a week or
113:08 whatever and someone will be you know
113:11 calling them to leave they're supposed
113:13 to go upstairs to talk to some other
113:14 dudes and as soon as I start talking to
113:16 them I just find the niches they're all
113:19 old episodes
113:20 these guys are riveted for an hour or
113:23 two making excuses while they're not
113:25 coming home it's hilarious so that can
113:27 be you two and you guys have some great
113:29 things to share so anyway on that note
113:32 take care of yourself and someone else
113:34 I'll see you in the next deep thoughts
113:35 over now
