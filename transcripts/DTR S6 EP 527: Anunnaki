00:14 so

00:27 [Music]
00:36 welcome back to deep thoughts man
00:39 so this is a message i'm putting at the
00:41 end of the episode which i'm going to
00:42 cut and paste to the beginning
00:44 of the episode as i feared
00:47 the the content of the anunnaki
00:51 is uh i think extremely boring
00:54 extremely insulting to anybody who
00:58 who would ever have a definition even a
01:00 mild definition of a god
01:02 so this episode's pretty rough and it's
01:04 pretty truncated
01:05 towards the end i'm going to
01:09 try and pat it a little bit at the end
01:10 here but just be aware
01:12 this is not a normal episode when i
01:15 started doing the research
01:16 on it it's so chaotic and so weird
01:19 and everyone's in disagreeance about
01:22 almost every single
01:24 interpretation of this from the official
01:25 to the unofficial
01:27 that this episode reflects that lack of
01:30 unity
01:31 within the archaeological community
01:33 anthropological community
01:35 so i do apologize in advance i hope you
01:38 dig it
01:40 it is not freezing out that's the
01:44 best thing about it for me it's 51
01:46 degrees man i feel like i am absolutely
01:49 sitting in the bahamas all right let me
01:52 preface this episode
01:54 right off the bat because i don't want
01:55 to get him get anyone angry he's coming
01:57 to this episode
01:58 for say college preparation or what have
02:01 you
02:03 this will be hopefully
02:07 not a messy review of the sumerian
02:11 anunnaki bloodlines of
02:15 anu and the journey
02:19 and that's gonna we're going to i'm
02:21 going to attempt to do
02:23 a to do justice i should say
02:26 to the official i think consensus
02:30 on anu and his wife
02:34 creating the anunnaki a new and key
02:37 creative naki and
02:41 then we're going to switch gears at some
02:43 arbitrary point when we get done with
02:45 that first thing because we'll digress a
02:46 little bit to discuss this
02:49 to get over to zechariah sitchin's
02:53 version of the anunnaki which
02:57 boy if it wasn't complicated enough i
03:00 would say
03:01 this dude at least makes it tremendously
03:03 interesting
03:04 i got a huge my father stick ready to go
03:09 it's one of my favorite 10 sticks on
03:10 planet earth
03:12 so what's interesting about this i just
03:14 want to give you a preface of how this
03:16 show came together
03:18 because what's funny about it is i was
03:19 watching some other video on something
03:22 completely different i can't even
03:23 remember what it was
03:24 and they started talking about the
03:25 anunnaki and then they
03:27 said of course they they look like
03:29 norwegian people they had blonde hair
03:31 and blue eyes
03:32 and they're really tall and all this
03:34 other stuff and then you
03:36 just do a little bit of research into
03:38 this whole story and you find out it's
03:39 sort of a mediterranean
03:41 sumerian babylonian region of the world
03:45 and there's no talk of this blonde hair
03:48 blue eye thing that i was able to find
03:50 at all
03:51 so so then i'm confused i'm thinking am
03:54 i looking at the right thing is that
03:56 am i looking for the nephilim what am i
03:57 looking for lumerian people like
04:00 did i get confused and so i keep reading
04:04 through this
04:05 information and watching videos and
04:07 little videos and super long videos and
04:10 and and i actually refused to watch any
04:13 history channel crap
04:15 but i did notice one thing that they're
04:16 doing in youtube if you aren't the
04:18 history channel
04:20 you get a annunaki link at the bottom of
04:22 your video linking over to wikipedia
04:24 unbelievable but if you're a history
04:26 channel boy you're just bona fide
04:27 totally true
04:29 which is nuts because you ca
04:32 when i scrubbed the playhead through one
04:35 of the history channel ones you could
04:36 tell they were saying the same thing as
04:37 the other ones that are
04:39 supposedly made by normal citizens of
04:41 which
04:42 can't possibly tell the truth only the
04:44 big tech can tell truth right
04:46 such a fraud right but then i started
04:48 getting over to other articles that were
04:50 sort of in the mezzanine between this
04:52 sitchin world and the sort of scholarly
04:57 archaeologists and they said that's you
05:00 know some
05:01 basically the internet's run off with it
05:02 sichuan was first sitching just died 10
05:04 years ago
05:06 and like october early october in 2010
05:09 to the 6th of the 9th i can't remember
05:10 how the number was turned in my head
05:12 but anyway interesting stuff so i've got
05:14 a little
05:15 app i use the microsoft to-do list
05:19 anytime i'm doing notes i hate
05:22 taking notes and having to read from
05:23 them because i think it blows the
05:24 cadence and i
05:26 i feel like only when it gets to be like
05:28 a
05:31 sacred geometry of chaos do i ever need
05:34 this
05:35 the family trees that i downloaded for
05:37 this particular
05:39 set of gods you could say was so
05:42 incredibly complex not in the fact that
05:46 there's probably
05:48 at least probably 20 names on average
05:50 well
05:51 architected annunaki family tree
05:54 but it's all the interpersonal
05:56 relationships between them all because
05:57 they almost all have
05:59 something going on between them so it's
06:00 like game of thrones
06:04 the other thing that i will preface this
06:06 with is that
06:09 because of all the pre-dynastic research
06:13 that i've done in the last you know five
06:15 years
06:18 and because i've been able to stand on
06:20 you know
06:21 the shoulders of giants like graham
06:22 hancock and
06:24 other people that he's brought in plus
06:25 the people did the was it the egyptian
06:28 code
06:29 or the pyramid code we know that any
06:33 suggested year by archaeologists or
06:35 anthropologists
06:36 is either a guess
06:41 or it is strategically positioned in
06:44 their
06:44 faux history to make sure that whitey is
06:46 always on top of everything
06:50 and i just simply don't believe it i
06:52 just don't believe any of the years
06:56 and quite frankly mud cuneiform tablets
06:59 have always given me
07:01 major major doubt even as a child
07:04 looking at this
07:05 probably more subliminal as a child but
07:07 just looking at it going
07:09 what is this again well these are mud
07:10 tablets sweetie
07:12 okay and that little indents are all uh
07:16 uh you know phonetic language yeah yeah
07:18 okay
07:19 and um i would use simpler terms back in
07:22 those days but i'm just kind of like
07:24 what stops them from creating this
07:25 language getting a bunch of mud
07:29 pounded it into the mud drying it out in
07:31 a particular way
07:32 that will satisfy whatever carbon dating
07:35 system you have
07:36 which you cannot date mud you just can't
07:39 okay
07:39 you can go get mud from some other
07:40 location and say
07:42 you know well this was when the earth
07:44 were down 50 feet and
07:46 whatever i also didn't know that this
07:49 ties into planet x theory
07:52 well the gifts just keep giving so let's
07:54 get started
07:56 so this story came together because the
07:59 sumerians
08:00 started to think existentially
08:04 and therefore they they needed to start
08:07 accounting for
08:09 the gods now i want you to remember
08:12 something about the invention of a god
08:15 in terms of
08:17 man doing this ritual and this is kind
08:20 of sad for me because i could probably
08:21 create a whole episode called the
08:23 invention of god
08:26 this is
08:29 is let's say i want to get you to do
08:32 something
08:32 that you don't want to do that will
08:34 benefit me in some way
08:36 it could be totally a selfish benefit
08:39 where i want you to
08:40 fix my car or i just want you to stop
08:43 being a
08:43 douche bag in my neighborhood and being
08:45 too loud and staying up too late
08:47 i don't want you to take your prettier
08:49 face and come after my woman
08:51 something now if i ask you to do it
08:55 you could still be a douche and keep
08:57 doing it what are you gonna do about it
08:58 we're gonna do about it right
09:00 however if i can go off a little a few
09:03 of the elders of the village and
09:05 we sit down and go okay you got that guy
09:07 yeah there's a bunch of those bastards
09:09 yeah and they're coming in from that
09:10 other norwegian place
09:11 we're all like six foot eight okay so we
09:14 got to do is
09:15 i got an idea we're going to say
09:18 that this universe of which you know
09:20 we're all been sitting around going who
09:21 made this thing
09:22 we're just going to answer the question
09:24 what yeah we're just going to answer the
09:25 question
09:26 we can't do that why not man they can't
09:29 prove it's not true
09:30 and i bet we can get most of everybody
09:32 else because you know let's just face it
09:34 we have invented books and writing yet
09:36 but everyone else will follow it
09:40 and over a period of time
09:43 guilt and obligation
09:46 will hopefully supersede a lack of
09:49 immorality due to a low iq
09:52 in fact i think we can use their low iq
09:55 to get them to believe it even more
09:58 and after a few decades oh my god this
10:00 will be the standard
10:02 but we will be the guys that write it
10:05 and once that gets hatched
10:09 wow oh wow do you have control over
10:12 society
10:14 and you know probably starts off with
10:16 some good stuff
10:17 and then it turns into some bad stuff
10:20 hence the catholic church and children
10:24 when i look at this story and i look at
10:27 the different interpretations of the
10:28 story
10:29 the different scripts that go off at
10:31 different problems it reminds me a lot
10:33 of kukolan
10:35 kukolin is the jesus christ of ireland
10:38 invented around 2500 bc which precedes
10:42 this stuff so this stuff goes back
10:45 much much further i guarantee it
10:49 but you had so many preachers and
10:52 priests of the celtic world
10:54 writing their little you know
10:56 soft-backed book about ku khalin
10:58 it's like when star wars finished
11:01 hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
11:03 paperback books were written about star
11:05 wars
11:06 when george lucas had to prove every
11:08 single one of them to not mess with his
11:10 universe you know
11:12 and that's what happens to these
11:14 situations if you don't have a catholic
11:15 church
11:16 to come after you if you start doing
11:18 that kind of stuff but as soon as that
11:20 fractured
11:21 then you get mormonism you get joseph
11:23 smith running around saying that you
11:24 know what he
11:25 jesus came to america's and they had the
11:27 wheel and
11:29 and steel and a bunch of stuff they
11:31 didn't have
11:33 and so you get that those weird
11:35 adjustments
11:36 this feels extremely hodgepodgy as if
11:41 it became almost a form of entertainment
11:44 to the point of like someone coming back
11:46 to the fire and saying
11:47 well then what happened and then what
11:49 happened i mean there's an infinite
11:51 amount of time between these people and
11:52 us
11:54 and so within what happened someone's
11:55 just willing to tell a story which is
11:57 where more siblings are born
11:59 more story extends uh subsequent stories
12:02 have very little do with the initial
12:03 story sometimes
12:05 it's messy which i'm just sharing
12:09 so you're going to get different uh
12:12 years on this
12:14 but the the way that this
12:17 probably should best be told
12:20 is the mother and the father
12:23 the yin and the yang of the universe and
12:25 their creation story
12:28 you have the description of the universe
12:30 and this
12:31 now i'm just gonna i'm not gonna say
12:32 much more about this but just imagine me
12:35 being a huge ethereal science guy and
12:37 hearing this
12:38 story of creation it's just beautiful
12:40 man
12:42 prior to us existing in anything
12:44 existing
12:45 their story is that there was a huge
12:47 body of water
12:49 flowing in the universe in a chaotic way
12:54 one half of the water was fresh water
12:57 and that's
12:58 signified by the man apsu the yin
13:01 then you have tiamat who's his wife
13:04 who's known as the salt water
13:07 when these two split apart we have
13:11 creation
13:12 she's known as the dragon he's known as
13:14 the human
13:17 so when they split apart and come back
13:20 they have her body comes down and
13:23 becomes
13:24 the earth and when they did this they
13:27 created
13:28 all of the younger gods their children
13:34 and what's interesting is is that uh
13:37 there's this constant theme
13:39 within this story which is that the gods
13:42 are extremely inferior intellectually
13:45 they're making mistakes perpetually
13:48 which means they are anything but gods
13:51 because they seem to lack the maturity
13:54 of an average adult today
13:56 which you know depends on how long these
13:59 people live back in those days
14:00 as to how when they write what they know
14:03 they can't exceed a certain level of
14:06 wisdom
14:07 and one of the overall themes is they
14:09 keep making children
14:11 and the children are too loud and too
14:13 boisterous
14:14 and so apsu kills all of his kids
14:18 so absu and tiamat
14:22 have a child they have several children
14:25 but anu
14:26 is their prized possession son he's not
14:29 a firstborn he's a second born
14:32 and he inherits through probably a level
14:34 of maturity
14:36 the skies he's known as the sky god
14:39 now this gets mistranslated i guess i
14:41 mean you know depends on who you believe
14:43 sitchin or other folks
14:46 sitchin took it so far that it's like
14:48 crazy but he'll translate that to
14:50 ufo people and really honestly the story
14:54 does talk about everything being in
14:56 space and eventually earth was created
14:58 and you know their estimation of when
15:01 this was first
15:03 written down the first person i heard
15:05 was
15:06 2375 bc inside the first scriptures
15:10 there's a story of them
15:11 coming to earth and making earth 400 000
15:14 years ago
15:15 then 450 i heard it in different source
15:17 and 500 in a different source
15:19 so generally in that area anu was
15:23 initially called
15:25 and anu is sort of the
15:29 all powerful god like we have today
15:34 except there would be no brothers and
15:35 sisters and other gods
15:38 what they did was they created an
15:39 ecosystem of
15:41 children all ancestral children because
15:44 remember back in those days
15:46 incest was a very common thing in terms
15:50 of
15:50 any royalty the pharaohs were all
15:53 ancestral
15:56 and apparently i guess their uh
15:57 congenital issues never arose
16:00 so that you know they didn't uh
16:02 co-mingle with other
16:05 families and so they i guess were able
16:06 to avoid it
16:09 so key is known as his wife
16:13 and they also say is consort now
16:16 i had a different source say that it
16:20 she was known as unto
16:24 and that the two of them coming together
16:25 and having kids made the anunnaki
16:29 the interesting thing about the anunnaki
16:32 physically
16:34 and there's no there's no mention of
16:35 their height and their size until we
16:38 get to homo sapien human
16:41 so they're just all kind of big and
16:43 gaudy
16:45 but they have five fingers and one thumb
16:48 and there's lots of artifacts to this
16:50 effect
16:52 their offspring were known as the utiki
16:56 eight he was at utu kki
17:00 their children on well anu with his
17:02 children
17:04 in lil and enki
17:07 form the trio that rules the heavens
17:11 at that point anew himself in the
17:13 scripture
17:15 they say he nearly disappears in the
17:17 scripture but every time he's mentioned
17:18 it's in some
17:20 extremely regal super god-like
17:24 realm and that he believes that he
17:26 should be
17:28 in the heavens where he was when he was
17:31 just fresh water out there
17:33 because he needs to be impartial and
17:35 allow the world to develop the way it
17:37 develops
17:38 and obviously that's an analogy to the
17:41 way that
17:42 if you must process god unless he comes
17:45 down and talks to you
17:47 now there are several iterations where
17:52 they keep having children and then they
17:53 hate their children and they destroy
17:55 them
17:56 just crazy and tiamat
18:02 is one that actually ends up striking
18:03 down a huge group of them
18:06 not all of them and so the
18:10 the remaining group of them
18:13 work together to try and figure out how
18:17 to
18:17 fight back and so they start fighting
18:18 back and fighting back until they
18:20 realize they can't fight back anymore
18:22 they're getting their butt kicked left
18:23 and right because tiamat's creating
18:26 monsters
18:26 to go get them
18:30 and then that that story segues into
18:33 like
18:34 three or four different versions of that
18:36 to the point where almost the uh
18:38 the nephilim are created as a monster
18:41 race to
18:42 destroy these folks and and then
18:44 eventually they end up creating
18:45 human after the nephilim seemed too
18:48 barbaric to keep around
18:50 but we'll loop around if this is totally
18:53 confusing
18:54 welcome to my world but it all settles
18:57 down to this dude named marduk
19:00 murdock is kind of a pimp man he
19:03 understands what's going on he's like
19:04 look guys
19:05 he goes to all his buddies who tried to
19:07 rebel against tmat
19:09 he says let me go talk to her we
19:12 obviously have to join her we can't beat
19:13 her she's kicking our butts
19:16 so let me kind of gather up our desires
19:18 our demands
19:20 our wishful thinking we can't really
19:21 demand anymore because we lost
19:23 let me see what i can do so they
19:26 say fine dude we don't want to talk to
19:28 her we don't want to get killed
19:31 this is where we get the inky in lil
19:34 saga where they create the servant class
19:38 marduk actually gets to kill tiamat
19:42 he shoots her with an arrow and kills
19:44 her
19:45 they said that her tears before she hit
19:48 the ground created the
19:50 euphrates river and this is when
19:52 tiamat's body becomes the earth
19:56 there's a guy named kingu who is
19:58 tiamat's assistant
20:00 and apparently without any major
20:02 description there's something called the
20:04 tablets of destiny which i guess are
20:06 tablets that are more like
20:08 magic tablets that if you write
20:10 something on them
20:11 that destiny occurs he is imbued
20:14 with the tablets
20:19 they also kill kingu because he's uh
20:22 he sides with tiamat and they
20:26 form humans out of the earth of her body
20:29 and the clay or the body of kangu and
20:32 the clay
20:33 from the earth which would probably be
20:35 construed as tiamat so tiamat and kingu
20:38 actually are the dna in which man is
20:39 made out of
20:42 marduk turns into his own religion
20:45 and they pretty much said that every
20:47 other god from that point ford was made
20:49 from mardoch
20:50 dna and this is where we get the
20:54 agapa agapa
20:58 as the first human and we are stripped
21:01 this dude was stripped of his more
21:03 uh his immortality and it's just a guy
21:07 one dude they're testing it out instead
21:09 of making a bunch of them
21:10 letting him get all rambunctious and
21:12 procreate too much and
21:14 overpopulate the world potentially
21:16 create global warming
21:17 which is in this story absolutely
21:20 hilarious
21:21 he's given a lot of abilities
21:25 this agup guy or dapa excuse me adapa
21:31 hate it when i make a mistake like that
21:34 adapa
21:35 which i'll show you some pictures of
21:38 he's traveling across
21:39 i guess the mediterranean or something
21:41 don't know and the wind is starting to
21:44 the wind's starting to get crazy and
21:45 eventually blows so hard
21:47 and knocks him off his boat and he falls
21:49 in the water
21:50 and it really pisses him off and so
21:53 with whatever power he has he stops the
21:56 wind
21:56 for seven days
22:00 and apparently anew who's supposed to be
22:02 way up in space and not paying attention
22:04 at this point
22:05 is a little perturbed how dare you
22:09 not make you know stop the wind we need
22:11 wind for lots of things
22:14 and so anew demands that he
22:17 gets an explanation from adapa as to why
22:20 he stopped the wind
22:22 of course adopt was like oh my god i
22:24 don't live forever man
22:26 i'm in trouble so he
22:29 gets approached by this guy named ia
22:33 who's just as bad as uh iago and
22:36 othello and he starts feeding up a bunch
22:39 of crap about what to do what not to do
22:42 now ia knows this is so good because
22:45 this is so true
22:46 that anew is probably going to offer him
22:50 some fruit and some food from his table
22:54 and even though he was created without
22:59 in without immortality
23:02 by marduk ia is afraid that
23:06 he's going to eat from the fruit of the
23:07 new and then he's just gonna gain
23:09 immortality and so he tells adapa hey
23:13 man
23:13 don't eat the fruit that's kind of bad
23:15 etiquette
23:17 essentially it boils down to don't do
23:19 much don't accept any gifts
23:22 bring anew maybe some textiles you know
23:25 some
23:25 some clothing and so then
23:29 adapa does his visit not pretty
23:31 uneventful
23:33 and he goes about and lives his life
23:37 he's just kind of a fisherman hunter
23:39 just kind of chills out
23:40 no responsibilities no mention of a wife
23:42 or kids
23:44 at least anything i read i mean who else
23:47 would he have sex with
23:48 he's the only human and then sort of
23:51 randomly
23:52 we're going to hang up that story
23:54 because you know the writer
23:55 isn't the same dude writing this story
23:57 and we get this
23:59 atrocious god where the word atrocity
24:03 comes from for sure and this is where we
24:06 get the story of
24:08 noah atrocitus
24:12 is told to build a boat it is the same
24:15 story of noah
24:16 supposed to get in his boat and it's
24:19 gonna be a bad flood
24:20 rumored to be about 2100 bc
24:23 and uh it's the same old thing everybody
24:27 gets wiped out he's on his boat it's got
24:28 a bunch of animals on there
24:30 done deal by the way the years
24:34 on these stories are pathetic i mean
24:36 it's like they'll say
24:37 well we think it was told between 2100
24:39 bc and
24:40 1645 bc
24:43 now at this point in the story
24:46 the mesopotamians start inheriting this
24:49 story and what's really strange is they
24:50 say that
24:52 for this to be real because these
24:55 tablets are dug up
24:56 and are discovered in 1947 the same time
24:59 they're
25:00 hatching the dead sea scroll
25:03 things which i believe are complete
25:05 fraudulent things
25:08 it just was something that needed to
25:10 happen to re-galvanize the church at the
25:12 time
25:14 and i know that'll be heresy to people
25:16 those things are old
25:17 okay whatever maybe they are
25:22 but in this region i mean i was told it
25:26 was egypt
25:26 they dug these things out but you know
25:28 sumerian babylonian mesopotamia
25:31 they create a story where 14 humans are
25:34 created
25:35 seven men seven females and they start
25:38 procreating
25:39 which is a kind of a cool thing it's a
25:41 little bit better than the story of
25:43 eden where we're hearing that um
25:46 there were the other people that they
25:49 joined when they left
25:50 eden and he's like you know
25:54 how did this how the other people create
25:56 be cr you know how are they there to be
25:58 joined right
26:00 but like always they make too much noise
26:02 and then uh
26:04 they're ceremoniously slaughtered again
26:06 you're not talking about a god
26:08 talking about an absolute categorical
26:10 hack
26:12 because they always have to have fire
26:14 and damnation they always have to have
26:15 punishment
26:16 they always have to have some
26:18 consequence within a religion
26:20 because that's the purpose of the
26:21 religion is to scare man into behaving
26:26 no religion written by man negates any
26:30 real creator of some kind at all
26:33 at all but to think of all this stuff
26:37 that was written ahead of time
26:39 teaching the elders of the future
26:42 you think we stand on shoulders of
26:43 giants they were standing on shoulders
26:46 of pre-religion giants
26:48 virgin births being you know very very
26:50 common i don't hear of any virgin birth
26:52 in this story whatsoever so that was
26:54 kind of refreshing
26:56 it's been a long time since i got
26:58 through gilgamesh and all that stuff
27:04 what is apparent to me with this
27:07 storyline
27:08 of the anunnaki as it is traditionally
27:11 told through the bonafide
27:13 quote-unquote archaeologist
27:15 anthropologist or whether it's not much
27:16 in archaeology besides finding
27:18 cuneiform tablets
27:21 is that this is an absolute chaotic
27:24 hodgepodge story
27:25 which really starts to
27:29 lose its value because it is so
27:31 absolutely chaotic and illogical
27:33 it is so utterly repetitive and humorous
27:37 and that they were like uh you know
27:39 there's a few twilight zones that were
27:41 that were done multiple times the
27:43 guardian angel that comes down and
27:45 protects uh
27:47 carolyn burnett carol burnett said her
27:49 name
27:50 and then protects this other guy and
27:52 then there was a dude
27:54 mr best who played a hillbilly and he
27:56 had two episodes every summer so
27:58 you cannibalize yourself this story is
28:04 just over and over and over again
28:07 but one of the documentaries i watched
28:09 said that they're
28:10 despite this being huge there's no
28:12 temples or anything that
28:14 really certify this story not like
28:17 if you were to visit earth today and
28:19 someone
28:20 were to walk up to an alien and say hey
28:22 we had this god that came down
28:24 jesus and tell the whole story to the
28:27 alien
28:28 well this alien could at least walk
28:29 around the entire planet and go
28:31 oh wow there's churches everywhere
28:34 respecting jesus so
28:35 that must have been real
28:39 i mean they would have to have the
28:40 foresight to to doubt it
28:42 they'd have to see something different
28:43 oh well we we get these everywhere we go
28:45 sort of thing right
28:47 so what's funny about it is is that when
28:49 zachariah
28:51 sitchin who's a russian dude comes
28:53 around with his version of this
28:55 reinterpreted story
28:57 i don't see anyone could criticize this
28:59 guy whatsoever
29:01 because he is giving you a much more
29:04 linear
29:04 meaningful story as crazy as it probably
29:08 is
29:08 and it defies all logic of of the
29:11 universe and
29:12 by the way sitchin's version of the
29:13 story definitely goes with round earth
29:16 you know normal cosmology
29:19 so if you're a flat earther you just
29:20 throw the whole thing out
29:23 which i don't blame you but this is
29:26 where sitchin's story turns into planet
29:28 x
29:30 and it all comes out of a book that was
29:32 written
29:33 that talks about this planet nibiru
29:38 it's like nibiru n-i-b-i-r-u
29:43 which is part of the planet x theory
29:44 right
29:46 it's essentially the entire foundation
29:49 of planet x is sichen's version of the
29:52 anunnaki no longer are they
29:56 out in the heavens like a cute continuum
29:59 guy controlling everything
30:01 they are stuck on a planet called nibiru
30:05 now i didn't see anything mentioned
30:07 about
30:10 a sun called nemesis no mention of that
30:13 at all and the stuff that i reviewed
30:15 but we know that's part of planet x
30:18 and i did a whole episode on planet x if
30:19 you're truly interested in my opinion on
30:21 that
30:22 but we're going to review it a little
30:23 bit here because it's right in front of
30:25 us
30:27 now this whole planet x thing was
30:29 pitched in
30:30 2012 to 2014 that some
30:33 channeling person that's how we find out
30:38 all the information about atlantis and
30:41 and uh
30:42 lumeria and those kind of things
30:45 but there's a mini solar system that
30:47 comes into
30:48 orbit uh what comes within our orbit
30:52 within our solar system every three
30:55 thousand
30:56 or so years they live on
30:59 nibiru and apparently the
31:03 ridiculous story is that they had an
31:05 environmental catastrophe
31:08 and so that they came to earth to steal
31:12 our gold and that they created the
31:16 nephilim first
31:17 to mine the gold but they were moronic
31:19 and big and
31:20 sort of hominidy there's even a picture
31:23 or someone painted with two heads
31:25 because they wanted to say like a
31:26 monster-ish kind of thing and then they
31:28 got rid of all them
31:29 and they really sat down and said okay
31:31 what were all the problems with the
31:32 nephilim
31:33 well one they were as big as the
31:35 anunnaki which was a physical problem
31:37 keeping them
31:38 in check because they could fight back
31:41 so they instantly make man about a third
31:43 the size you look at most of the
31:47 tablets that have the mud art which are
31:49 ironically really tiny
31:52 the way that art is created is they keep
31:53 stacking up little pieces of mud
31:56 on top of each other that's how they
31:57 create the reliefs it's not like
31:59 egyptian reliefs where they're carving
32:00 it out of stone or pre-dynastic stuff
32:02 right
32:03 now you have to have a huge lack of
32:06 cosmology knowledge
32:07 a huge lack of any physics or anything
32:10 and really have to be just devoid of any
32:12 logic in your brain to swallow this next
32:14 part
32:15 so their solar system is going to swing
32:18 two hours
32:20 now let's just think about this for a
32:21 split second earth goes around
32:24 the sun supposedly once every year
32:28 i mean i've been here a few years seems
32:30 like that's the case
32:32 and if this story were correct and
32:35 they're swinging through
32:36 because their solar system is swinging
32:38 through our solar system
32:40 i'm thinking that's a pretty fast orbit
32:43 probably at least as fast as the earth
32:46 takes to go completely
32:47 around a star at 93 million miles away
32:51 at its center all right
32:56 so technically speaking they would only
32:58 be here a few
33:00 months out of the year and then they
33:02 wouldn't see them again for another 3000
33:04 years
33:05 that's the physical reality of the story
33:08 if you believe in
33:09 normal cosmology however
33:12 the story is that when nibiru gets
33:15 really close to earth
33:16 they hop off their planet fly over here
33:19 with some spaceships
33:20 and start doing this genetic engineering
33:23 to take our
33:24 gold because they really super duper
33:25 need it in their atmosphere
33:27 gold being propped up as this special
33:31 element that can do something that all
33:33 the elements and the
33:35 periodic table can't do which is sort of
33:37 utterly absurd but whatever
33:39 it is a very stable thing it's very
33:41 conductive and that kind of thing
33:44 but they're able to get thousands of
33:46 years of evolution
33:48 done and tested even to the point where
33:51 they had
33:52 a problem where the
33:56 children the humans had so messed up the
33:59 earth
34:00 that they melted the ice caps of course
34:01 this is a more
34:03 recent addition to the story because
34:04 that is the propaganda they're putting
34:06 on us right now
34:07 and that they had to get in their
34:08 spaceships and fly into space and sit
34:10 there and hover for a little while
34:12 to uh you know let it all kind of dry
34:15 out
34:17 as if that would take a couple days to
34:20 accomplish right
34:21 it's just like they would have to be
34:23 here for
34:25 hundreds of thousands of years to pull
34:26 this thing off i mean it's just
34:28 the most ridiculous thing i've ever
34:30 heard in my life
34:32 again if you've never been to any other
34:33 episode and i mentioned this
34:35 if you have genetic splicing
34:37 capabilities people you've got fusion
34:39 capabilities therefore you could take
34:41 dirt or even fecal matter and turn it
34:44 into gold
34:45 you could it wouldn't be very efficient
34:47 energy conversion-wise but you could
34:48 definitely do it you could move around
34:50 atoms
34:52 and move around the atomic components to
34:53 atoms and fuse them together
34:55 if you had that knowledge of genetic
34:57 engineering for sure
35:00 it's a lot i mean we know how to create
35:02 gold from anything
35:04 it's just it makes no sense because it
35:06 takes so much energy to do it
35:08 but if we needed gold to survive as a
35:11 race
35:12 trust me people work double shifts it
35:14 would get done
35:16 we'd pedal bikes until we got it done
35:18 right
35:20 now where these individuals turn into
35:22 blonde hair blue-eyed nordic people
35:25 is i couldn't find it all i heard was
35:27 the claims
35:28 i watch videos with claim after claim
35:30 after claim with absolutely no source
35:32 whatsoever
35:35 and so it's just kind of like
35:36 heartbreaking to
35:38 try to put this together now what i
35:42 find kind of strange about the anunnaki
35:44 story
35:45 because if we go back to the original
35:47 sort of lore of the whole thing
35:49 if you follow the game of thrones times
35:52 10 down to the bottom of the official
35:54 story
35:55 they have this this final moment where
36:00 and this is part of situation story too
36:02 that they
36:03 they finally say okay we got all the
36:05 stuff we need from you now
36:06 there's no gold harvesting and
36:08 atmosphere fixing in the real one
36:10 sichuan put that together and sitchin is
36:12 accused of reading sentences
36:15 out of context he's accused of um
36:19 reading sentences and putting a period
36:21 at the end
36:22 when i i thought you look at cuneiform
36:25 stuff and you're like i don't see any
36:27 periods or
36:28 anything so you know can you blame the
36:30 guy
36:32 but they leave behind not only a human
36:34 race but they finally realize okay we
36:36 got to give you enough knowledge to
36:38 build run your own world
36:39 so we get a bunch of engineering
36:40 mathematics reading language all this
36:42 other stuff
36:43 except those pre-dynastic people who
36:45 built the uh vassal boxes who forgot to
36:48 write anything on them
36:49 and so that you know later was etched by
36:52 essentially
36:54 bad graffiti people but they try to say
36:58 that there's
36:59 a race or sorry excuse me like almost
37:02 disciples
37:04 ish and i i don't mean to there's no
37:06 strong connection with christianity here
37:07 whatsoever don't get uh
37:08 don't get that confused but they leave
37:11 behind
37:13 a group of people to run the earth and
37:15 that they're always supposed to be the
37:16 ones running earth
37:18 and what's really weird about this is
37:21 that
37:24 the amount of protection about the story
37:26 of anunnaki
37:28 on the deep state big tech platform of
37:30 youtube
37:32 is really strange why do you care why in
37:35 the hell would you care
37:37 if i talk about anunnaki or someone else
37:39 talks about i'm sure
37:40 as soon as i post this video down below
37:42 is going to be a wikipedia
37:44 post because i'm not the history channel
37:48 actually the the 12th planet book was
37:50 written in 1976 so i apologize doesn't
37:53 go back that far
37:56 now let's review for a split second the
37:58 theory that maybe these cuneiform
38:01 mud tablets were simply placed there
38:04 by present-day people to be then later
38:07 discovered and read and that sort of
38:09 thing
38:10 actually because the story is so
38:13 awful in terms of anything related to a
38:17 premise
38:18 a story a beginning a middle and end
38:22 the uh the interesting thing about it is
38:24 that you would think that if anyone were
38:26 to
38:27 create this story and insert it to
38:29 create some sort of faux history
38:31 that it would have a much more unified
38:35 purpose to our life
38:38 to perhaps challenge christianity or to
38:42 take a religion that's out there and
38:44 establish it a little bit more
38:46 in history and
38:50 it's absolutely
38:53 not doing that it is too chaotic
38:56 too partial and
39:00 too discombobulated to be read as a
39:02 story
39:04 with any level of sort of meaning it's
39:07 almost like reading the politics of a
39:09 really
39:09 screwed up family because there's just
39:13 you know some basics when you talk about
39:15 a god
39:17 and i tell you what if you're christian
39:20 there is no better story to read
39:22 than this gobbledy goop to reaffirm your
39:25 belief in christianity
39:27 because that story is as clean as a
39:28 whistle absolutely the new testament is
39:32 compared to this and even the old
39:33 testament seems like a beautiful
39:36 you know collection of stories that have
39:38 meaning and significance to our lives
39:40 you can get truth out of it that applies
39:42 to your life
39:43 whereas if you read the story of anu
39:47 and tiamat and
39:50 who again has a bunch of different names
39:53 eventually you do spawn out of this
39:55 whole thing ishtar
39:58 who we knew we know today queen ishtar
40:02 slash
40:04 sumerimus queen samaramis who's the
40:06 statue of liberty
40:07 she is the colombia movie records or
40:11 movie
40:12 logo they worshipped that
40:15 her owls who were the advisers to her
40:19 get snuck onto the crazy illuminati
40:21 dollar bill
40:23 there's crazy owl statues and
40:27 bohemian grove
40:30 but what you don't have in the story
40:32 i'll just make
40:33 this clear unless again you know some
40:35 other
40:36 chapter and i wouldn't be surprised if
40:38 someone told me they they drove
40:39 corvettes at some point
40:41 i mean just nothing surprises me it's
40:43 just oh i make up a story okay get some
40:45 mud yeah let's do it baby
40:47 okay but there was no
40:51 real nefarious behavior and a matter of
40:53 fact the second that any
40:55 race i guess started to sing and dance
40:58 and
40:58 and enjoy themselves well the gods hated
41:01 them immediately they made too much
41:02 noise
41:04 okay well how big is the universe how
41:07 big are the heavens
41:08 that i knew would be annoyed by them
41:11 maybe just
41:11 has really good hearing i don't know but
41:14 to have this genetic capability
41:16 of manipulating life itself
41:20 but you just can't get anything right
41:22 hmm
41:24 and there's no story of where the water
41:26 came from
41:27 i guess it's just sort of an is but it
41:30 has salt and it has
41:32 fresh water together which is obviously
41:35 probably an anomaly for their timetable
41:37 to go
41:37 why is rain always fresh and the ocean
41:41 is always salty i doubt they understood
41:44 evaporation
41:45 other than if you spill some water it
41:47 dries up
41:48 but in terms of its sort of osmosis
41:52 that happens that's why anyone telling
41:54 you that we're running out of fresh
41:55 water
41:56 i mean the lack of just logic you have
41:58 to have in your brain not to believe to
42:00 believe such a thing
42:02 what you do get rid of rain when is rain
42:04 going to turn salty
42:05 how's that even possible if it was
42:07 possible it would have already happened
42:09 it rains constantly we just don't
42:11 capture it very well
42:13 that's all i'll tell you this i was
42:16 planning on this episode being really
42:18 fun
42:19 and interesting i thought i was going to
42:20 get into ufo stuff i thought i was going
42:22 to find out these uh
42:24 these individuals that are sort of these
42:27 norwegian people
42:28 that would be kind of funny but i found
42:30 nothing
42:32 zero now let me just venture off into
42:36 some sort of related or one related
42:39 issue that is very interesting
42:40 which is this
42:44 a parent and i'm trying to find the
42:46 exact location if i find the exact
42:48 location
42:49 the sentence will remain in the video
42:51 and i'll show you on the screen
42:53 which is where in south america they
42:55 claimed
42:56 to have statues of bearded
43:00 people which are always sort of
43:03 eastern orthodox looking priests
43:07 and again south america well all the
43:09 americas they didn't have facial hair
43:12 which is sort of interesting but they
43:14 didn't have facial hair so when you see
43:16 facial hair
43:17 then you know you're looking at someone
43:18 who has seen someone else
43:21 from a different area now again
43:24 thousands of years you got even if you
43:26 had a little boat you can always sell
43:28 across the coast
43:29 you just follow coastlines coastlines
43:31 and it's going to get real cold at some
43:32 point
43:33 but so you you know here comes spring
43:35 and you're like okay this is when the
43:36 world is the warmest
43:38 in the northern hemisphere this just
43:40 starts sailing
43:42 and somehow they make it to the americas
43:44 and they go over the european
43:46 area or they go through the african belt
43:51 and again there is
43:54 more and more evidence i just keep
43:56 running into between episodes that the
43:58 oceans were a lot lower at one point
44:02 and so maybe the journey was a lot
44:04 easier and totally different you know
44:06 i'm sort of uh thinking about doing
44:10 an episode on atlantis and lumeria all
44:12 in one
44:14 because i don't think there's enough
44:15 time to do it like this one falls apart
44:17 pretty quickly
44:20 what really fascinates me is the sort of
44:23 uh
44:24 allure uh in p certain people's minds
44:28 about this story
44:30 it is like finding a fictional
44:35 story which must be exciting it must be
44:37 exciting if you
44:38 truly have all of the knowledge that
44:40 these tablets are actually authentic
44:43 and this story was told and shared and
44:45 this is what these people believed
44:47 from that perspective i guess
44:50 that's sort of exciting look how
44:54 primitive the humans were who created
44:57 this story
44:58 that they created the most inferior
45:01 examples
45:02 of any god that has ever been
45:04 prophesized
45:06 ever right now i will tell you that some
45:08 folks
45:09 try to get off on the notion that this
45:12 story was a precursor
45:14 to the old testament story of the
45:16 creation of of
45:18 god through genesis they get off on the
45:22 idea that they did have a flood story
45:25 in the area and for me the flood of noah
45:28 i don't believe noah ever existed i mean
45:30 i think that's just uh
45:31 again what won't you believe if you
45:34 believe in noah
45:34 you know don't tell me you believe it
45:36 out of guilt i mean that's why the
45:38 world's going to [ __ ] in the hand
45:39 baskets because everyone's believing
45:41 everything that everybody tells them
45:44 you should feel guilty oh okay i do man
45:46 how guilty do i feel
45:47 do i feel like uh uh i told a little fib
45:50 guilty or should i like i cheated on my
45:52 wife or i killed my neighbor guilty
45:54 how guilty do i feel you know the story
45:57 of noah
45:58 is a is a story about a god that can't
46:01 get it right
46:02 i mean god our you know well i shouldn't
46:06 say our
46:06 i should say our christian american god
46:10 is really really flawed gets pissed off
46:13 all the time you've heard me say this
46:15 100 times
46:16 i don't like that definition i feel like
46:19 if you're
46:21 if you're going to actually well if you
46:23 believe for any moment of your life
46:26 as a soul that you're going to stand
46:28 before the creator
46:29 and you're going to say man i love what
46:31 you did with flooding the earth and
46:33 stuff
46:34 and you're just looking at this being
46:36 that knows
46:37 everything right absolutely
46:40 everything that could be known is known
46:43 by this being if you're eating the
46:44 ultimate one right
46:46 and you're sitting there going i think
46:48 it was really cool when you made that
46:49 big mistake
46:51 tell me about some of your other
46:52 mistakes god i got a little time here on
46:54 my hands
46:56 you would know right away the second you
46:59 get in the presence of god
47:00 the believing in all these flawed
47:02 stories all these angry moments of god
47:05 all this hey kill your son to prove you
47:07 like me
47:08 whoa if your neighbor was substituted
47:12 for god and almost all these stories and
47:15 then i told you the story
47:16 and they said what do you think of your
47:17 neighbor you would not come up with
47:20 angelic
47:21 stuff all right you would not come up
47:22 with perfection
47:24 you come up with like what the hell's
47:25 wrong with your neighbor he came over
47:27 and made you
47:28 kill your son i mean you didn't he
47:29 called it off at the last second because
47:31 he's a sick weirdo
47:33 and that's the way you like you proved
47:35 that you believed in your neighbor's
47:37 existence i mean
47:38 who the hell is that guy we need to get
47:39 that guy on some pedo list or some crazy
47:43 killer list or maybe he can go to jail i
47:45 mean like
47:46 come on and this is god
47:49 well let's let's set that standard as
47:51 high as we can right
47:54 see the interesting thing when you study
47:55 like native american
47:57 belief systems it's very beautiful
48:02 it's very balanced with nature and you
48:05 have
48:06 a story that feels like you could
48:08 believe it
48:10 christianity you know at least new
48:12 testament wise uh
48:14 pretty clean story a lot of the old
48:16 testament pretty clean
48:18 subtract all that cancerous reaction
48:22 anger world destruction stuff and you
48:24 got a pretty good little story
48:26 you know and it's not like you read um
48:28 about you know king solomon and you're
48:30 seeing god everywhere
48:31 it's just the story of that dude
48:34 whose life provides lessons but i
48:36 guarantee you
48:38 any one of our lives that's even mildly
48:41 lived
48:43 has the same lessons
48:47 it does because we can i can either you
48:49 will just use me as an example telling
48:51 my life story
48:52 which pretty much is a show right i've
48:55 done stupid things you can learn from
48:57 and i've done some smart things you
48:59 could learn from well you're the same
49:00 way
49:01 if we reverse the tables and you told me
49:03 your story
49:04 i'm gonna i'm gonna get it you know or
49:07 i'll see
49:08 my own likeness in you because
49:11 oh yeah totally i did that too wasn't
49:13 that a doozy
49:14 you know yeah oh yeah thought i was
49:17 going to marry the first girl i met when
49:18 i was 12. you know
49:20 one of those kind of things i thought
49:23 the job was going to last forever
49:24 i thought the economy was just going to
49:25 be good forever i thought world leaders
49:28 told the truth
49:28 i thought mass media told the truth
49:32 so let me ask you why do we believe this
49:35 stuff in the first place
49:38 for those of you who who have partaken
49:40 of my screenwriting
49:42 series which is very very few of you
49:47 i told you way back at the beginning
49:51 that my writing teacher robert mckee
49:55 opens every class with the phrase or at
49:58 least the sentiment
50:00 that man needs story we need it
50:04 partly out of just the fact that we live
50:08 in a loop
50:09 of our life and we need escapes
50:13 because it gets boring good stories
50:17 will have you looking at the world
50:19 differently looking at humanity
50:21 differently looking at yourself
50:23 differently
50:24 and you might make changes to yourself
50:26 because
50:27 you believe in something the star wars
50:30 franchise for instance
50:32 has a good example of that because it
50:34 has heroes in it
50:37 and they
50:40 will help you vicariously live through
50:42 the hero
50:44 which as a symbol to you
50:47 will have you either being good or bad
50:50 right your average gangster kid
50:52 wants to be bad they want to be scarface
50:55 they want to be in a situation where
50:57 they are
50:58 you know chainsawing a guy in a shower
51:00 they want
51:01 they want to be the guy with the the big
51:04 over and under machine gun and say hello
51:06 to my little friend they dig that that's
51:07 that's
51:08 uh sort of what they they think if they
51:10 get that strong then no one will mess
51:12 with them in their
51:14 in their area of life because it is
51:16 threatening
51:18 if you live in a better neighborhood
51:19 well then you want to be luke skywalker
51:22 you want to be maybe one of your
51:24 favorite heroes whatever that is i'm old
51:26 so i won't name
51:27 any more heroes with the story of the
51:30 anunnaki
51:31 it's almost devoid of anyone you would
51:33 ever want to be
51:35 everyone's a conniving backstabber
51:38 a new who's supposedly this heavenly god
51:41 is just so
51:42 short-tempered he makes inferior beings
51:46 and then he kills them over and over and
51:50 over tmat does the same thing murdoc
51:52 marduk
51:53 does the same thing it's just does
51:56 anyone know how to do anything right
51:57 at this realm if that's being a god i
52:00 don't want to be one
52:02 ever because i have more wisdom and
52:04 intelligence
52:05 and i know my limits you know i wouldn't
52:08 try to
52:10 synthesize a a living being together if
52:12 i didn't know what the hell i was doing
52:14 but why do we as human beings
52:18 strive for this stuff one i think that
52:22 if you like your world you like
52:25 the way the economy is going you like
52:27 the way your friend circles work your
52:29 family works your job works all that
52:31 good stuff
52:32 you like yourself in the mirror then
52:34 you'll tend to want
52:35 stories that probably complement your
52:38 life but
52:39 it's so funny that when life goes well
52:41 we tend to retreat away from our
52:43 escapes you don't need to see
52:46 we don't need to go to church as much
52:48 inside your mind you tend not to pray to
52:50 god as much
52:51 when life is good if you're smart you'll
52:54 say thank you
52:54 but even then you're like hey you got
52:57 everything
52:58 right in my life right now god and i'm
53:01 just gonna say thank you and i'm gonna
53:03 maybe go to church once every sunday
53:05 nothing wrong with that
53:06 and then um you go back to your loop
53:10 the second life gets hard my god you
53:13 can't ask for enough
53:15 you just can't but you also look for
53:18 escapes
53:19 i told you a long time ago that uh i
53:22 learned in school
53:23 in my screenwriting school
53:26 that uh was it snow white released in
53:29 1936
53:31 by the disney organization became
53:34 extremely popular because it was in the
53:36 middle
53:36 of the depression and even though
53:39 there's nothing for anyone in terms of
53:40 solutions in that movie
53:42 it is an escape to a beautiful world
53:45 that
53:45 is perfect it has drama there's
53:48 positives and negatives and that kind of
53:49 stuff but
53:51 compared to soup lines and suffering
53:54 being hobos and homeless people because
53:56 your government's messed everything up
53:58 because they're
53:59 doing a deal with the devil it was great
54:03 and now we're seeing those kind of
54:04 things mandalorian the
54:07 series on tv i won't ruin anything for
54:10 you but
54:11 if you haven't heard that season two
54:13 ended really well then you've been under
54:14 a rock
54:16 i recommend if you like science fiction
54:18 and if you especially like star wars and
54:20 you haven't seen
54:21 every single episode of mandalorian
54:24 find a way to do it and then when you
54:28 and be very careful because don't go on
54:30 youtube
54:31 and look for stuff because they're going
54:32 to spoil it for you really quick
54:35 but if you're able to just you know
54:38 close your ears and your eyes
54:39 get to these just rent disney plus for
54:42 one month and just binge watch this baby
54:44 from start to finish
54:46 there is a reaction to the final episode
54:51 which has never been done in hollywood
54:54 history
54:55 meaning the videotape reactions of
54:58 people on youtube which is why you do
54:59 not want to go to youtube to see this
55:02 are so stunning that as a writer
55:07 john favreau or favreau i don't want to
55:09 say his last name exactly
55:12 i always hear favreau then i hear people
55:13 say favreau like god i hate to meet the
55:15 guy
55:16 the first question i'll ask the guy
55:17 who's like how do i say your last name
55:18 right no one will beat that guy
55:22 for probably another hundred years
55:25 because there's one thing about copying
55:27 his writing style
55:28 and there's another one where you do it
55:32 for the first time
55:33 and i know that in when you learn
55:35 screenwriting
55:37 the only other moment in history movie
55:39 history was in star wars and empire
55:40 strikes back
55:41 and this is not indicative of the ending
55:43 of matadorian whatsoever
55:46 but when darth vader tells luke
55:48 skywalker that he's his father
55:50 the world shook you know that was a
55:53 first
55:54 but it was sort of a macabre piece of
55:56 information you know
55:57 i'm your nemesis and i'm your dad very
56:01 freudian
56:03 the brilliance but the reason
56:06 why this will make more sense to you
56:08 when you hit the final episode if you
56:10 haven't already seen it
56:11 be very careful in the comments please
56:13 not to run it for everybody
56:15 in fact if you haven't seen mandalorian
56:17 don't read the comments just in case
56:20 because i want this to be wonderful for
56:21 you
56:24 after you finish it i want you to
56:27 think about the times that we're in
56:31 and when anything good happens we're
56:33 just
56:34 feeling it from our souls up
56:37 but i'll you know what i'll backtrack
56:39 i'll backtrack to the trailer
56:41 to the force awakens which was a
56:45 a pile of poo the trailer
56:49 was off the charts i got very emotional
56:52 with the trailer and i'm sitting there
56:54 going my god i am being emotional to a
56:56 trailer this is impossible it's never
56:59 happened in my entire lifetime
57:02 and it was the fact that they narrated
57:04 the thing perfect because they said
57:06 light was going to beat the dark
57:09 if you've been a conspiracy person for a
57:11 while and you've studied agenda 21
57:13 especially 2020 which we never thought
57:15 would ever happen
57:18 it's that that's the mode we're in right
57:20 now if you're into like saving humanity
57:23 there are a bunch of folks out there
57:25 ceremoniously trying to destroy it
57:28 so the theme of the trailer was way
57:30 better than the movie
57:32 the movie never accomplished the
57:33 trailer's guarantee
57:36 what i'm not convinced of is the
57:38 following and i think i've tried to
57:40 explain this a few times but i might be
57:42 a little bit better with the words in
57:43 this particular episode
57:47 my concern is this if man
57:50 continues to believe any fiction
57:54 as being true that i believe man
57:57 has essentially chained himself
58:01 to his own demise
58:05 and here i am a fictional writer
58:08 i want to screen write screenplays that
58:10 i write
58:12 when they are viewed as a film to be
58:14 construed as fiction
58:16 with beautiful truths in them
58:19 that will make you look at it from your
58:22 perspective
58:24 from your judgment table not
58:27 adopting the film as your religion and
58:30 viewing everything from the perspective
58:32 of fictional characters
58:35 having said that i do believe
58:39 that man is very immature very
58:42 very immature which is why these
58:45 institutions continue to exist and
58:47 continue to be
58:49 the only way several humans
58:52 millions if not billions of them can
58:56 find
58:56 any paradigm in their soul to clean up
58:59 humanity to clean up the world to tell
59:01 the truth
59:01 to have morality i still hear my friends
59:05 talk about you know
59:10 i hate to be expressing any judgment
59:14 whatsoever
59:14 because i don't mean to judge anyone
59:17 it's just i haven't seen benefits come
59:19 out of
59:20 a lot of these types of behaviors but
59:23 i'll hear people talk about
59:25 maybe going to a party where a bunch of
59:27 crazy stuff is occurring
59:29 and they're telling the story as if
59:31 there's some huge
59:33 wonderful thing about this thing
59:36 when if they were to continue that
59:38 behavior for any length of time after
59:40 the party
59:41 they might chemically lose their life
59:43 they would probably be ostracized by
59:45 most of society
59:46 and they would be you know sort of the
59:49 reason why
59:50 the fabric of humanities is unraveling
59:53 before our very eyes you know
59:56 the worshipping of possessions is why
59:59 most of this stuff is happening
60:00 almost categorically you know it for a
60:02 fact only an insane
60:04 person might do negative things for
60:07 no money there is an interesting
60:09 character in um
60:10 stephen king's the stand
60:14 i can't remember the dude's name it was
60:15 played by max headroom
60:17 the actor when they did the television
60:19 series which i thought was actually
60:21 excellent i had just finished the book
60:23 for the first time about two years
60:24 before the
60:25 tv show happened so i was like oh this
60:27 is gonna be a night because the shining
60:29 television show was just awful just
60:32 awful so miscast and i like the actors
60:35 that were in there but you can't take a
60:37 comedian
60:38 actor off that that airport show and
60:40 make him jack nicholson you just
60:42 can't you can make jonathan winters play
60:45 the devil i mean
60:46 unless he's funny it's not going to make
60:48 any sense right
60:50 but this character in the book the
60:52 underbridge 1500 page plus version
60:55 was a pyro he was insane
60:58 and the devil in the book which is a
61:02 the story is really simple in the stand
61:04 if you haven't read it
61:05 the devil well there's a huge virus that
61:07 kills off 99
61:08 of the world and apparently there's no
61:11 uh
61:12 reality besides the united states in
61:13 this story
61:15 all the devil worshipers go to vegas and
61:18 all of the guy worshippers go to
61:19 colorado
61:21 and then eventually colorado has to make
61:23 a pilgrimage to vegas
61:25 to fight the devil it's a very long
61:28 story
61:29 but on the way this sort of crazy dude
61:33 is called
61:34 to uh to vegas but he's sort of
61:37 destroying things on the way there
61:38 because he just can't stop
61:40 and there's some pretty pretty insane
61:43 stuff in the underbridge version i don't
61:44 know if it's in the
61:45 shortened version but yeah he gets into
61:49 some really
61:50 weird stuff it's not for the average
61:52 person
61:54 i would say if you're a person that
61:56 doesn't swear in
61:57 in life and you don't like being exposed
61:59 to bad things don't read the story
62:01 because it's
62:02 wow but i have to say that looping back
62:05 on
62:06 babylonian sumerian cuneiform
62:10 writings in mud as i was studying
62:13 egyptology
62:15 that was heavily documented that these
62:19 uniform tablets were recording the kind
62:21 of minutia of life
62:22 you know a merchant selling someone furs
62:25 or
62:26 doing a barter deal it was the
62:28 mathematics and the ledger of
62:30 transactions and all that kind of stuff
62:32 now one thing
62:33 starts to kind of ebb up through all of
62:36 this for me personally which is
62:39 you know there's there's wild
62:41 conspiracies that are like um
62:43 the pyramids were built in the 1800s
62:46 and again the people that do massive
62:49 stone work
62:50 in the 21st century still can't explain
62:53 how
62:53 virtually all of it happened which i
62:55 think is interesting so
62:57 us having those skills in 1800s would be
62:59 um
63:00 quite amazing and again you'd be talking
63:02 about
63:03 decades and decades and decades of the
63:05 1800s and the fact that people were
63:07 actually
63:07 there documenting the digging out of
63:10 egypt
63:10 that theory is just absurd
63:14 but you go back further and you're like
63:16 okay are any of these cuneiform tablets
63:18 real the
63:19 sumerians in the babylonian history
63:21 based on anything real or someone trying
63:23 to insert something for a reason
63:26 on one side of the game they make the
63:29 sumerians
63:31 slash babylonians look uh very
63:34 intelligent
63:36 they have interesting stories again like
63:38 i've mentioned several times in episodes
63:40 where they said that
63:43 this has been so long since i read it
63:44 but it it stuck with me that they said
63:47 that
63:48 every few hundred years these beings
63:51 would come out of the mountains
63:53 never said spaceships or anything
63:55 strange or chariots made of
63:57 fire or whatever but they would come
63:59 down to the civilization
64:00 and get rid of the leadership and then
64:04 establish new leaders to fix everything
64:06 and then they'd go away for a few
64:07 hundred years until it got bad again
64:09 they come back down and replace it
64:11 what's interesting about that story as a
64:14 as a contrast to this anunnaki
64:16 gobbly goop is that that story at least
64:20 makes sense
64:21 doesn't it even if they were beings from
64:24 space that set us up
64:26 and then sort of kind of moved into the
64:28 hills to kind of watch us
64:29 right just knowing that i mean seriously
64:32 if you don't have any mode of travel
64:34 and you just say we're gonna live up on
64:36 this mountaintop and we'll just take
64:38 little spaceship trips home or whatever
64:39 we're doing
64:41 maybe just living a good life who knows
64:44 you know
64:44 no one can reach you because no one can
64:46 climb those mountains because they don't
64:47 have the technology yet
64:49 second they do well you're gonna have to
64:50 live someplace else further away
64:52 as long as you got a mode of
64:53 transportation hell maybe in the
64:55 background they are traveling in
64:56 spaceships
64:57 for those of you believe in a dome earth
65:00 it's always been alluring to me that um
65:03 these could be the dome owners setting
65:06 us up in some petri dish
65:07 to watch us do our thing
65:10 even if there's a god and there's a
65:12 firmament and we're inside some dome
65:15 he's conducting an experiment then
65:18 there's that lady from
65:20 was it the tinker website that called
65:23 her mother and said that this is all a
65:24 matrix it's all a big mind experiment
65:28 and then she you find her dead in the
65:30 back of a car with no
65:32 no cause of death no toxicology problems
65:34 whatsoever
65:36 and they're like what the hell happened
65:37 and supposedly she was gonna move a
65:39 bunch of her money from her tinker
65:41 pakistani
65:42 company i think it was pakistani
65:46 to this other sort of ai research
65:49 department
65:50 and the weird thing is i read her i read
65:53 her background
65:55 and she came to orange county to go to a
65:58 conference and then went to san
65:59 francisco where she actually ends up
66:00 dying in the
66:02 i think the sort of san jose area
66:05 makes you wonder right it makes you
66:08 wonder if uh
66:10 if you found evidence of something if
66:13 someone would
66:14 say okay that's just too much you got to
66:16 come with us and we'll just
66:19 render your body dead or we'll put a
66:20 body double in there or whatever because
66:22 they got big technology or whatever
66:25 or they just kill you one of the two
66:29 how many of you watch star trek and when
66:30 they bring a primitive up to the
66:32 enterprise and you just think oh my god
66:34 how awesome would that be
66:36 for some reason you're in the right
66:38 place at the right time and you see some
66:39 humanoid alien
66:41 doing something and they look at you
66:43 like oh crap well you got to come with
66:45 us
66:46 you're going to dig it but you got to
66:47 come with us so you're going to miss
66:48 your family and stuff
66:50 on one level you're you're dying inside
66:52 the other side you're
66:53 you're on fire with excitement and
66:55 curiosity
66:58 what i don't know about this anunnaki
67:00 story
67:01 is if take if you're a christian think
67:04 about this
67:05 i can't speak for any other religion i
67:08 think it'd be pretty
67:09 easy to probably describe islam and the
67:12 muslim foundations but
67:14 let's just say christianity and you meet
67:16 someone who knows nothing about it
67:19 it's very easy to tell that story and
67:21 it's very easy to map it back to a
67:23 purpose to the person you're telling
67:24 to the degree they believe you you know
67:26 you're born with original sin and
67:28 and we've got to go to these other
67:30 humans to
67:31 to who have the divine right to sanction
67:34 heaven to us and
67:35 uh you got to get baptized you got to do
67:37 this you gotta do that and
67:38 then you go to heaven pretty simple it's
67:41 a p
67:42 it appeals and applies to your life if
67:45 you believe it
67:46 that makes sense to me but imagine
67:49 you're back in this time
67:51 where this convoluted mess is being
67:55 written on a daily basis right you can
67:57 just tell it's just being written
67:59 every new generation is just extending
68:00 the story down further and further
68:03 and if you were trying to say to a
68:05 friend
68:06 do you know who created the universe no
68:08 man tell me
68:09 okay here's some salt water and some
68:11 fresh water and then you know they
68:12 kept screwing up left and right
68:16 and you're just kind of going okay uh
68:19 i'm here now and you're here now and uh
68:21 apparently they're not here now
68:23 so how does this apply to me now oh it
68:26 doesn't it's just sort of a you know
68:27 it's like ford prefix telling the story
68:29 of
68:30 the beginning of the universe and the uh
68:32 what is it the
68:33 restaurant at the end of the universe
68:37 and he tells this funny story about how
68:39 it's like a
68:40 it's like a conical bath and you take
68:42 the plug out and you fill it full of
68:43 sand you take the blood
68:44 take the plug out and it drains out of
68:47 the plug and then
68:48 you film it you film it you see and then
68:50 you thread the filament backwards and
68:52 then you play it backwards
68:53 and all the sand comes spinning up out
68:55 of the drain
68:57 and arthur dent goes is that's how the
68:59 universe started and he goes
69:01 no but it's a good it's a good
69:03 conversation starter
69:04 isn't it like oh god so
69:08 for that reason it appeals to me zero
69:11 i don't know why it appeals to
69:13 anthropologists other than just to maybe
69:15 say
69:15 we're discovering what these people
69:18 think
69:20 when you look at egyptology or at least
69:22 the dynastic period
69:24 of belief it all makes sense
69:27 gods have purposes gods do things for
69:30 you so you can make it over the river
69:31 sticks i mean it
69:33 it's an ecosystem that makes sense
69:35 annunaki
69:36 no ecosystem planet x well that fails
69:39 every single test of logic
69:41 one could apply to the brain and the
69:44 thing is is you don't want to be so
69:45 invested in a belief system
69:47 that even though it doesn't work out at
69:49 all on paper you're still hanging on to
69:51 it because you've made too many posts on
69:53 social media saying you believed it
69:54 before you really realized didn't make
69:56 any sense
69:57 it's sort of funny because
70:00 you know there's this sort of joke
70:02 online which is social media
70:04 is the wrong place to start working out
70:06 your personal problems you know
70:08 it's the wrong place to to share your
70:11 most
70:13 intimate problems before you have a
70:15 resolution for them you know if you were
70:16 a drug addict and you got away from it
70:18 then you could post how you did that and
70:19 that might be interesting or
70:21 or you know if you're hurting and you
70:22 just need people to call you
70:24 probably if they're your friends and
70:26 they can't call you
70:27 text them don't post on social media
70:31 so we get this this weird phenomenon
70:33 where we've invested in
70:35 so many of our statements and we have
70:37 this weird knowled
70:39 weird feeling in our mind like a person
70:42 online
70:43 will go back and read every single
70:45 social media post you've ever made
70:47 and then construe this opinion about you
70:49 that could be
70:50 hypocritical or contrary to yourself you
70:53 know
70:55 thus deeming you sort of unfit to be
71:00 married to be employed because you're
71:02 just a chaotic mess
71:06 so maybe shedding some of that stuff and
71:09 and just saying you know this is what i
71:10 say because
71:11 you know my my policy with things like
71:13 flat earth
71:14 is that you know i never even thought
71:17 about it until
71:18 eric dube put out his video and then a
71:20 bunch of friends of mine and we were all
71:21 kind of like yeah you know there's some
71:22 of that and there's these tests and
71:24 it really looks like there's some
71:26 compelling evidence that
71:28 some of the science that tells you it's
71:30 the other way around
71:31 earth it doesn't pan out with some of
71:34 the laser tests unless there's something
71:36 about the earth we don't know and now
71:37 light bends the atmosphere we don't know
71:39 whatever and so but my policy is
71:43 try to believe it for a i probably did
71:46 i think like four weeks where i really
71:49 took it into my mind i just okay i'm
71:51 just gonna go out every day and think
71:52 about this place being flat
71:54 and just think about what that means to
71:56 me like how does that change
71:57 anything in my life and it did change
72:00 things if i were to continue believing
72:02 it
72:03 i still find it a very romantic theory
72:05 and i respect people who
72:07 invest in it it's gone very quiet
72:08 because again no one can prove it
72:11 and the need the things that need to
72:13 happen to prove it
72:16 apparently have not been done you know
72:17 like filming a
72:19 a um a gyroscope
72:23 in the dashboard of a plane
72:27 seems like it'd be pretty easy fly from
72:29 london
72:30 to cairo for the pilots that have come
72:32 out and said that the
72:34 that the um horizon never rotates
72:37 and that would mean you're on a flat
72:38 earth because it should rotate because
72:40 you have changed horizon levels
72:42 from when the gyro was spun in london to
72:44 when you land in cairo
72:45 you've tilted your orientation to to
72:49 london
72:50 okay if you're gonna go on the bbc and
72:52 say that
72:53 then get out your iphone okay and at a
72:56 minimum if you're really bad at it just
72:57 take a picture at the beginning and take
72:59 a picture at the end and say look it
73:00 didn't change no one's gonna believe it
73:01 because you did videotape it
73:03 so go buy yourself an 800 camera that's
73:06 got enough
73:07 camcorder time on it to record the whole
73:09 journey
73:11 bring your batteries or whatever you got
73:12 to do plug it into some
73:14 power supply in the cockpit and film it
73:17 start to finish let's see it and then
73:19 we're all going to go whoa
73:21 that's that's crazy where is that
73:23 nobody's got it you don't have to go to
73:25 nr to go with that piece of evidence
73:27 i haven't seen it so i think that's
73:30 about all i got for this particular
73:32 episode i do apologize for being kind of
73:34 messy or very messy
73:38 i gotta let it go through because that's
73:40 the story of the anunnaki in my opinion
73:43 but again so many of the interpretations
73:45 change
73:46 i don't know how that occurs i guess the
73:49 the tablets
73:50 what what is hard about the story is
73:52 that they're written in this cuneiform
73:54 and i wasn't able to find a source that
73:57 just translated them i guess into the
73:59 closest approximation of english
74:01 so that one could read through them as
74:04 clearly as possible but then you have to
74:05 trust the translations as well
74:08 so it's just a mess anyway
74:12 if you like better episodes watch the
74:13 other ones and go to
74:15 deepthoughtsradio.com just bookmark it
74:18 it's got everything on there you need
74:20 there's some new items in the store
74:21 so go take a look at those other than
74:23 that take care of yourself and someone
74:25 else and i'll see in a much better
74:26 episode of deep thoughts
74:27 over and out
