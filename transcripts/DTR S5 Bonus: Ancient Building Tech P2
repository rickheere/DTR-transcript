00:30 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentlemen
00:33 i almost had the mic problem my uh
00:36 i got everything plugged in but the
00:37 little power clip on the side of the
00:40 computer was screwed up
00:42 so this is going to be the final part of
00:44 the uh
00:46 at least the summer 2020 of ancient
00:49 building tech
00:51 i imagine if you know new stuff comes
00:53 out and there's tons of stuff out there
00:55 especially with this brian forrester guy
00:58 i will be making other episodes i don't
01:01 know if i'll call it the same thing
01:02 maybe i should that way it's all one big
01:04 suite
01:05 of episodes you can just binge watch at
01:08 a future time
01:12 definitely um just
01:15 amazing revelations that i think that
01:19 we're almost not prepared to
01:21 process in our brains
01:26 the second portion
01:29 because i watch two hours of a seven
01:31 hour video
01:33 it's really six hours and 50 minutes so
01:36 there's five
01:36 hours left in the
01:40 information is going to make up this
01:41 last episode which uh of this particular
01:45 uh run of the episode probably last one
01:47 in season five
01:49 so we're gonna cram about five hours of
01:52 stuff into this one
01:54 which should make it much more exciting
01:55 and fast paced
01:57 but i really want to encourage you guys
01:58 to think about
02:02 what this really means as we go through
02:05 this because
02:06 uh for those of you listening on podcast
02:09 there's going to be like the first part
02:12 lots of photographs
02:13 from his presentations a few that i'm
02:16 going to find
02:16 you know just as i
02:20 digress i'll go grab other photos i
02:22 don't know if i'm going to digress in
02:23 this one but
02:24 his photos are so well done that you
02:28 really don't need to search on much else
02:31 outside of his
02:33 as outside of his purview so we're going
02:35 to cover a few things i just want to get
02:37 out this plate
02:37 the places that he covers we're going to
02:39 cover balbeck
02:41 which is uh just outside of beirut in
02:44 lebanon
02:45 we're going to go over to mexico a lot
02:48 of
02:48 inca aztec mayan things are built
02:52 and then we're going to go to easter
02:54 island
02:55 and then we're going to come back to
02:57 egypt just as i suspected
03:00 he did gloss over the pyramids he
03:03 mentioned him a little
03:04 bit in his first section but he ends up
03:05 coming back now his video if you watch
03:07 it
03:08 which is again six hours 55 minutes or
03:10 somewhere in there
03:12 there are some editing flubs at the end
03:15 it's like he got tired
03:17 of editing his own stuff and trust me i
03:19 know all about that
03:20 so he missed a couple of his mistakes
03:22 but he does exactly what i do
03:24 which is he messes it up he pauses and
03:26 then he
03:27 redoes it he just forgot to cut a few of
03:29 them out then there's a few glitches
03:31 where he ends up repeating
03:32 as soon as he gets to mexico he ends up
03:34 repeating about a 10 minute clip twice
03:37 and so you end up hearing the same
03:38 things over and over again
03:40 probably not bad for muscle memory
03:45 but again as we go into this i want you
03:48 to open your mind
03:49 first so that you take this in you know
03:51 last one was sort of uh
03:53 hey let's come over here and then we'll
03:55 all explore this together but now that
03:56 we've
03:57 we know about brian forrester's
04:00 approach the really
04:03 amazing part of his approach is that he
04:06 is looking
04:06 at ancient builders
04:10 from in his estimation 12 000 years ago
04:13 which is around 10 000 bc
04:15 again there's a lot of people out there
04:16 that take it back a lot further than
04:18 that
04:19 he's not opposed to it but he has a
04:21 whole theory about
04:23 the galaxy as a whole
04:26 and because he's mainly a an
04:29 archaeologist
04:30 and i don't know how much he has with
04:32 cosmology i think he's very mystified by
04:35 folks that took shots in the mid-1950s
04:38 and then people who built books on that
04:40 and he's definitely selling some books
04:42 so we're gonna give you his theories at
04:44 the end of this episode
04:46 about what he thinks might have reset
04:48 mankind something
04:50 obviously did
04:54 but we have a civilization on earth
04:58 a long time ago
05:02 they had achieved
05:06 a bizarre mix of technology
05:10 they seem to lack any expression of art
05:15 it was always form function and shape
05:20 now that doesn't mean they didn't create
05:21 a few statues here and there
05:23 that could be dated way back because
05:25 they have statues in egypt that are made
05:27 of
05:29 1200 ton rocks put together
05:34 they have colossus statues that have
05:36 been blown apart
05:38 that you know any one piece you could
05:40 barely move and it used to be all
05:42 together
05:42 and massive we have a culture that
05:48 you know evolved sort of
05:51 you know like we know our
05:54 group of humanity grew which is to
05:57 discover
05:58 engineering which means you have to
06:00 discover mathematics first
06:03 and then you must have the ingenuity of
06:04 the homo sapiens sapien to build tools
06:06 to solve problems that you can conceive
06:09 right how do you build a borehole drill
06:12 if you don't perceive the fact that you
06:13 need a borehole in the first place
06:17 you know what do you do to evolve to
06:18 that point well
06:20 you bore bore bore war bore by hand
06:23 maybe
06:23 you know some chisels or some
06:28 sticks inside mud and you start to
06:30 figure out you can
06:32 you know control water
06:35 control sunlight maybe create a little
06:37 optic to to catch a star in a particular
06:40 hole in your
06:41 in your home probably all mistake to
06:44 begin with it all
06:45 serendipitous moment that then starts to
06:47 gain a strategic
06:48 approach as time moves on as wise people
06:51 come and go
06:54 and it's odd that they would achieve
06:56 such a massive amount of technology
06:59 we're talking about pythagoras theorem
07:01 pi
07:03 every single thing the greeks
07:04 rediscovered they had already discovered
07:07 everything they had figured out ways of
07:10 moving
07:11 rocks and it just blows the mind
07:16 imagine having the technology to create
07:18 something that we've only invented in
07:19 the last couple hundred years which is a
07:21 circular bore
07:22 saw with diamond crested tips you get to
07:26 that point but you haven't figured out
07:28 a vcr he hadn't figured out a car he
07:30 hadn't figured out
07:31 combustion engines wow
07:37 the consciousness of man maybe was a lot
07:39 more sound or maybe it wasn't
07:41 technically man
07:43 or maybe it is men but we are
07:44 technically something that we don't even
07:46 understand
07:47 and perhaps these structures were simply
07:49 built
07:50 very simple very devoid of art which
07:53 then
07:53 calls back to another culture he calls
07:56 back to another planet
07:57 to keep everything clean we're just
07:59 going to provide you
08:00 with utility to exist
08:04 you won't know because your primitive
08:07 versions of them
08:08 meaning us our ancestors you would walk
08:11 around and just
08:12 like waking up in a dream it's just
08:14 there you know did you wake up as a
08:16 child
08:17 and when you were born and then walk
08:18 outside and go what are these cars doing
08:20 what are these things you know
08:22 what's that thing in the sky you know
08:23 what no you just accepted
08:28 later art was added well sophisticated
08:31 society
08:33 usually always incurs art
08:36 art is a huge part of all things
08:39 storytelling is a huge part of any
08:41 sophisticated culture
08:43 you know my writing teacher i think has
08:45 made the point that
08:46 that he learned from others that
08:50 any creature with a consciousness
08:53 a true sentient consciousness i think
08:56 therefore i
08:57 am descartes kind of things need stories
09:01 to role play in the mind what a human
09:04 being
09:05 may or may not become
09:08 so we have evidence of
09:11 inventions that blow the freaking mind
09:16 and then we have sort of a bizarre
09:20 absence of things that we find
09:23 important imagine thinking
09:28 that i'm going to give you a little
09:30 tidbit from the end here
09:31 you know the bible goes back about 4 500
09:34 bc
09:35 and that's where a lot of scientists get
09:37 all angry with biblical people
09:40 and you know it's just when that book
09:41 started being written and so if you just
09:42 want to negate everything that happened
09:44 before that that's your choice
09:46 doesn't bother me whatsoever
09:50 but perhaps the previous culture
09:55 evolved for tens of thousands of years
10:00 and got to a point where they didn't
10:01 like art
10:03 what about all the you know cave
10:04 paintings in france
10:06 about the peruvian desert stuff
10:10 i mean some of these paintings have been
10:12 dated you know just
10:13 it's all probably bs about when these
10:16 things actually occurred but they've
10:17 been pushed back
10:18 tens of thousands of years
10:23 and there's going to be a theory that
10:24 i'm going to drop later on about
10:28 why they think we might have been truly
10:30 cavemen
10:33 and their theory has to do with we
10:35 weren't cavemen and then we were cavemen
10:37 and then now we're no longer anymore but
10:39 could you imagine us getting to a point
10:41 where we no longer needed art
10:44 perhaps it is that uh like there's a
10:46 star trek episode for voyager
10:48 where they stopped by this planet and
10:50 they're trying to get back home to earth
10:52 for those of you know the series they're
10:53 about 80 years from earth due to an
10:55 accident at the beginning of the first
10:57 show in the first season now they're
10:59 hauling ass back
11:02 but they bump into a world that is that
11:04 trades stories
11:08 as the highest commodity in the world
11:10 they trade art because they have been
11:11 around for so long they've heard all
11:13 their stories and they want news stories
11:16 i don't know sounds strange
11:20 and then to go into this obsessive art
11:22 after
11:23 this non-art phase it's weird
11:26 to go into i don't know the
11:30 more delicate ornate creation of things
11:33 when before we could move
11:35 800 ton stones
11:38 dozens and dozens of them this balbeck
11:41 place
11:42 it's b-a-a-l-b-e-c-k
11:46 it is about a hundred acres it's huge
11:50 and what's nice about it is a lot of the
11:53 surrounding areas are privately owned so
11:55 anyone who wants to come to research can
11:56 hang out and there's not a guard you
11:58 know saying don't look at that don't
11:59 look at this
12:01 which you'll experience in great
12:03 quantity
12:04 quantity in egypt and you'll experience
12:07 it just a little bit
12:08 in south america there's a gigantic
12:11 stone
12:12 that is actually frozen in time that is
12:15 a
12:15 thousand ton stone and it's still
12:18 connected to the ground
12:21 and i believe there's some damage on one
12:23 side that they believe that may
12:26 be responsible for it being abandoned
12:28 but
12:29 all of these giant structures that are
12:31 abandoned
12:33 caused the archaeologists to lean back
12:35 on this idea that there was something
12:36 that reset the
12:38 the time for man and
12:41 brian forrester is one hundred thousand
12:43 percent twelve thousand piece
12:44 uh one thousand years ago ten thousand
12:46 bc which we'll get to his own theory at
12:48 the end here
12:53 so baldback is a region obviously
12:56 lebanon sort of area
12:59 outside of beirut it was heavily
13:01 contested
13:02 right it's a it's a
13:05 marine based land mass so
13:08 you know trade routes it's just easy to
13:11 live on the coast because you've got the
13:13 benefit of inland
13:15 uh vegetation animals plus you've got
13:17 fishing
13:18 trade routes you see a commerce
13:21 that goes there so it was fought over
13:23 for
13:24 literally at least a thousand years
13:29 and so it suffered all kinds of damage
13:34 the romans oddly engaged in some of
13:38 their
13:38 biggest construction in that area
13:42 that they didn't do anywhere near rome
13:46 columns that are taller than any other
13:48 columns they ever constructed
13:50 and it may have been strictly because
13:52 they were super duper influenced by the
13:54 megalithic structures
13:56 that they discovered the gigantic
13:59 foundational stones
14:03 now the stones aren't uh
14:06 there's two main types of stones
14:10 and one of them is right there it's it's
14:13 part of the local
14:14 region it's kind of a limestoney thing
14:18 and again this is all like seven out of
14:21 a
14:22 a system of one to ten it's a seven so
14:25 you have to use
14:26 very very
14:29 hard materials to etch it
14:32 to break it and we're talking about an
14:35 era where
14:36 in the the pre-roman
14:40 construction we're looking at most
14:43 likely
14:45 8 000 years before the bronze age
14:48 bronze of course being very very
14:52 light in its ability very soft
14:56 but then you have these sort of red
14:59 granite pillars
15:01 and what's interesting about them is
15:03 they stick out like a sore thumb because
15:04 there's nothing like it
15:06 so the limestone ones that are 800 tons
15:08 a piece i mean there's
15:09 just dozens and dozens of these things
15:12 creating the foundation
15:13 of both the mesa of the plaza floor
15:17 but it's also the foundation of these
15:20 buildings
15:24 there's no sign of these things being
15:25 dragged around
15:27 the land is covered with lots of
15:28 vegetation it's very hilly
15:31 so if they were going to excavate you
15:34 know some pathway into this local area
15:37 it should be very evident
15:40 trees the old theory of rolling rocks on
15:44 you know telephone poles doesn't work
15:47 out with a thousand ton rock
15:50 but 800 ton rock it doesn't work it
15:52 would totally and utterly obliterate
15:55 the tree but then to even do that you're
15:58 gonna have to do it on a prepared
15:59 surface it's got you can't be going
16:01 uphill downhill uphill down
16:03 you're gonna have to cut a straight path
16:04 and hopefully a little bit downhill
16:06 from where you're pulling this thing in
16:08 the first place and the land is
16:10 just extremely hilly
16:14 but the red granite pillars are
16:18 another it's probably the closest thing
16:20 that these individuals
16:23 who built these big structures that then
16:26 the romans built on top of and the
16:28 romans put a tremendous amount of effort
16:30 into this area
16:31 so they built some gorgeous things on
16:34 top
16:34 but you immediately can see the
16:38 rocks that go on top of the big rocks
16:40 and this is his entire
16:42 theme of the seven hour videos he shows
16:44 you the rocks down below
16:45 and the rocks up above rocks down below
16:48 are
16:49 mind-blowingly gigantic no mortar
16:52 they're interlocked
16:53 in most cases you can't put a human hair
16:56 between
16:57 these gigantic rocks of course in machu
17:00 picchu you have a tremendous amount of
17:01 interlocking rocks that just
17:03 makes the brain blow up it's crazy
17:07 but with the rocks above you see that
17:09 they were actually cut for something
17:10 else
17:11 they it's like they had a purpose like
17:13 it was a machu picchu type
17:15 thing maybe not as randomly cut but
17:18 they're just sort of stacking them up
17:19 and stacking them up and this is most
17:21 likely
17:22 due to the massive amount of
17:25 contested ownership of the area right
17:28 but the red granite in this area
17:32 uh the geologists from you know
17:35 the area and from here that would go
17:37 over there they said look this red
17:39 granite the closest quarry for it is in
17:41 as one
17:42 egypt which is about a thousand miles
17:46 away
17:48 the granite pillars
17:51 are anywhere from 15 to 20 feet tall
17:55 i think he undershot it by about 10 feet
17:58 with some of these gigantic pillars
18:01 and maybe he was just referring to the
18:03 slide he was looking at but
18:04 they're all one piece like over in petra
18:09 except these things are utterly gorgeous
18:12 i mean
18:13 they just you know they they're they're
18:15 beveled at the bottom they come up
18:18 they swell then they taper off and have
18:21 this beautiful ornate stuff on the top
18:23 all one piece and it's extremely clear
18:27 that these
18:28 things were mounted and spun on a lathe
18:32 absolutely uncontested perfect symmetry
18:36 unlike the ones in petra that have a lot
18:38 of scratch marks on them
18:40 these are perfectly polished
18:44 and what he said was he goes look we've
18:45 had engineers come with us and he says
18:48 he happened to have an engineer on this
18:49 particular trip it's his first trip to
18:50 balbach
18:51 and he said look this dude said you know
18:55 we 200 years ago we would cease to have
18:58 the technology to create
19:00 one of these pillars but he goes 2 000
19:03 years ago
19:04 no way no way which is specifically
19:07 referencing when the romans got there
19:08 and started doing what they were doing
19:11 there are hundreds and hundreds
19:15 of these pillars that have
19:19 fallen down and what the romans
19:22 attempted to do and i guess some of the
19:24 local restoration by architects uh
19:26 sorry by maybe archaeologists is they
19:29 took you know some pieces and they kind
19:30 of figured out
19:31 okay i think maybe these fell together
19:33 and so they reassembled them
19:35 these modern cement modern techniques to
19:39 put them back together
19:42 he found a few of these columns which
19:47 were about i'd say based on him being
19:49 let's say six feet he looks like he's
19:51 pretty tall
19:52 i'd say he's a little bit over six feet
19:55 it's at least a seven foot diameter on
19:58 one of these pillars that had fallen
19:59 over
20:02 and he was standing next to one that was
20:04 fairly
20:06 white so it might have been a limestone
20:08 one he
20:09 you know points he was like look the red
20:11 granite ones are 100
20:12 from a previous era previous technology
20:15 but these white ones maybe they were
20:18 created by the romans
20:19 but he has a you know a right angle
20:23 ruler with him and he's just pushing it
20:25 up against this thing and he's like you
20:27 know you move it up and down he goes
20:28 there's not a single blemish on this
20:30 thing
20:31 other than the weathering but he goes
20:32 you don't have any
20:34 indentations you don't have any reliefs
20:36 out he goes this thing is
20:38 as close to laser perfect as it could
20:41 possibly be
20:43 and how can you do that without some
20:45 sort of circular saw
20:47 without some sort of advanced technology
20:49 which only today
20:51 we have a chance of doing
20:55 now we also know that the romans had a
20:58 superior formula for concrete
21:00 and i think that even to this day we
21:02 don't quite have exactly what they had
21:04 where it was like a concrete that
21:06 was so pulverized and so amazing that it
21:08 almost
21:09 could be mistaken for a marble
21:13 so then he finishes with ball back and
21:15 you really need to see
21:17 his slideshow i'm going to obviously be
21:19 cutting in some of his slides here and
21:21 you definitely i'll link it down below
21:22 so you get a chance to see it
21:26 the repetitiveness the consistency of
21:28 his theories are
21:30 sort of undeniable you will have an area
21:33 a ball back that is again a
21:34 hundred acres so it's phenomenal um
21:37 you just need to see it and it looks a
21:40 little bit like grease it looks a little
21:42 bit like the parthenon here and there
21:43 but it's much more destroyed
21:46 but you'll have a wall that looks like
21:48 it's very man-made bunch of
21:50 clunky blocks that aren't you know
21:52 fitted together properly someone just
21:53 stacked them
21:55 and also you have an 800 ton stone
21:58 perfect
21:59 just unbelievably smooth perfectly
22:01 mitered edges
22:03 90 degree angles and you're like okay
22:05 there's no way in hell
22:07 but whoever did the rest of this work
22:08 did this one unless the guy fell out and
22:11 hurt his head
22:12 but the amount of craftsmanship that the
22:15 romans added
22:16 was uh probably some of the finer
22:19 craftsmanship i've ever seen
22:21 roman architects so if you ever went
22:23 there you would probably be observing
22:25 at least three different cultures you'd
22:27 be seeing the unknown culture that we're
22:30 still trying to figure out who they were
22:32 than the in-betweens
22:34 which don't have much in the way of art
22:36 and then you have the romans showing up
22:38 doing a lot of their classic structures
22:42 but fairly close by is a place called
22:44 biblos
22:46 and biblos is a sort of a roman
22:49 marine marina
22:53 fort that's there apparently biblos
22:55 means
22:56 uh the book which is why
22:59 the bible is called a bible
23:02 it's derivative of biblics at least
23:06 you know that's one of the theories uh
23:09 you know he's pretty cautious about some
23:11 of that stuff
23:11 could be someone with a play on words
23:13 but it makes sense to me
23:16 but now in this particular little thing
23:19 it's a pretty boring shot when you first
23:21 see it and you're just kind of like okay
23:22 it looks pretty humid he's like look
23:25 biblos
23:26 is interesting he goes pretty much
23:29 all of it looks very very man-made
23:31 extremely small blocks compared to the
23:33 stuff over a ball back
23:36 but then there are these
23:40 i would say about 10 inches maybe 8 to
23:43 10 inch diameter
23:46 red granite pillars that are
23:50 inserted in the wall sideways
23:53 sort of like taking the place of a brick
23:55 and then it has more all around it and
23:57 it
23:57 kind of looks strange it's kind of like
23:58 when you you cut up uh
24:01 hot dogs to make that little beans and
24:03 frank thing it looks kind of strange
24:06 but of course
24:09 it yearns back to as one
24:12 what's strange about the bilbo's thing
24:14 for me is that
24:16 in balbeck you have
24:19 gigantic pillars uh that are just
24:22 formidably gigantic
24:24 and then you have both in length and
24:25 both in diameter
24:28 and then to have these really small ones
24:30 it's very strange
24:34 so something to look at and there's
24:36 definitely you know here and there's
24:38 these gigantic stones of the interlock
24:40 and they don't have any mortar
24:42 and on top of them you see some shoddy
24:44 work
24:45 with mortar it's really strange
24:50 but now we're going to go over to mexico
24:53 and it's essentially most of the land
24:56 north of peru
24:57 that he's talking about but it's it's
24:59 currently today what is recognized as
25:01 mexico which
25:02 is all the way down to the uh the end of
25:04 the gulf there the panama canal and that
25:05 kind of stuff
25:07 this is where you get um again more
25:11 honesty in my opinion from the locals
25:13 now there's still some confusion down
25:14 there and of course we're just trying to
25:16 make the best assumptions but what they
25:21 have is obviously several different
25:23 types of pyramids down there and i think
25:25 he's
25:25 i've now bounced into some of his other
25:27 videos he definitely needs to do more
25:29 detail
25:31 but you have essentially a bunch of
25:34 structures built out of
25:36 basalt which i guess is some volcanic
25:38 rock
25:40 with some bucketing rock mixed in i
25:41 don't know if bath salts about gank rock
25:43 or not
25:45 but you have um names for these temples
25:50 and i forgot one of the names one of the
25:52 names was built three times and it's
25:56 sort of a lower
25:57 you know stair-stepped pyramid you guys
26:00 have seen these things and i'll show you
26:02 the pictures
26:02 inside the video but they were pretty a
26:05 pretty uh upfront about the fact that
26:08 hey we even named it after what we did
26:10 we found it we built it then we built it
26:12 again as each leader came in they kept
26:13 stacking rock more and more
26:16 but what's interesting about that if you
26:17 really were to role play that in your
26:19 brain as i
26:20 said it and you hadn't seen the
26:21 photographs yet
26:23 you'd probably think well the foundation
26:25 then just like every other photograph
26:27 this guy has the foundation would be the
26:28 big bronx and then on top of that you'd
26:30 have little rocks and lit rocks
26:32 and you're not completely wrong except
26:34 there's one
26:35 exception with these temple slash
26:38 pyramids
26:39 of mexico the stair
26:43 steps they go up the center and you've
26:45 seen these 100 times in
26:47 movies you know indiana jones type
26:49 movies especially
26:51 those seem to be gigantic rocks
26:54 with a lot of precision
26:57 along the way up the staircase you have
27:02 two to three ton stones sort of ornating
27:05 every
27:06 plateau that they end up creating
27:09 it's very interesting there are rumors
27:12 that uh when mexico city was
27:15 um well okay so one part it's not a
27:18 rumor
27:18 one part is a rumor we know that this is
27:21 the spanish conquistadors who were
27:25 having you know had christianity as a as
27:27 their foundational control mechanism for
27:29 the mind
27:30 they came over and immediately started
27:33 to destroy things to then install
27:34 churches
27:36 and i don't know how they deduce this
27:39 but
27:39 the locals have constructed
27:42 this very elaborate model of one of
27:46 their temples
27:47 where they claim and again this is just
27:50 a model and a room
27:52 i don't without seeing any evidence of
27:54 this personally i
27:56 find hard to believe this can be made
27:58 it's a fairly gigantic temple
28:00 built sort of pyramid-y but sort of
28:02 plateau pyramid-y like they do
28:04 and then they built an enclosure over
28:05 that and one over that
28:07 and one over that with air gaps between
28:09 the walls
28:10 such as you could walk around i mean
28:12 we're talking about even the roof blocks
28:14 not portraying any sort of mechanism to
28:17 hold up the roof with you know giant uh
28:19 bath salt or volcanic rock
28:22 so that many that may actually be
28:23 wishful thinking
28:25 in some some regards there
28:29 but if that was true it would have been
28:32 right next to the
28:34 uh the great pyramids of egypt
28:36 deprecated only a little bit because it
28:38 would be
28:39 several tens of thousands of years after
28:41 the pyramid so we have to give the
28:42 pyramids the uh
28:44 the og badge of honor
28:47 of being way ahead of the rest of of
28:49 civilization
28:52 now what's interesting about um the
28:55 americas
28:56 in general is that
28:59 when we came to america um
29:02 from europe if that's you
29:06 we didn't find the wheel anywhere
29:10 which is really odd sophisticated
29:12 societies building things with no wheels
29:17 the uh
29:20 northern americans were known as it was
29:22 known as ashland at this maybe
29:24 a a a romanticized story
29:29 but they were trying to say that the
29:30 northern americas were ashland it was
29:32 derived from the
29:33 possible inhabitants from atlantis who
29:36 fled
29:37 after potentially a flood kicked them
29:39 off their land
29:40 right but there's a place called tuslin
29:44 where they have these atula warriors or
29:48 atlantean warriors which was named by a
29:52 fictional writer that may have been
29:54 dreaming up things
29:57 and so you start to get some artistic
29:59 impression they're
30:00 probably one to two ton stone stacked up
30:03 on each other and then they're cut into
30:04 these warriors
30:06 there were rumors that the
30:08 [Music]
30:09 uh that the statues are holding like
30:11 laser weapons and that kind of stuff and
30:13 i guess when the locals told them no no
30:15 no it's not one of those if you pay
30:16 attention to
30:17 the little waist area where there's a
30:20 hand
30:22 they had managed to build a
30:26 crossbow with about a 14 inch arrow
30:29 and that was fairly prominent in the
30:30 area and
30:32 that's what that was but the other thing
30:35 that makes it a little bit difficult
30:37 in this region is that in the mexico
30:39 region is the earthquakes also
30:40 contributed so you have the spanish
30:41 kikistores coming over
30:43 destroying things in the name of
30:44 christianity and then you've got
30:46 obviously normal environmental wear and
30:48 tear then you have routine earthquakes
30:51 also shaking things apart and
30:54 part of the part i'm skipping that i
30:56 watched in that
30:59 second two-thirds was that he did cover
31:01 machu picchu
31:02 again and did reveal that
31:06 within machu picchu of those amazing
31:08 interlocking walls that
31:10 there are tons of stones that where the
31:12 walls have actually kind of pulled apart
31:15 and so the interlocking isn't working
31:18 anymore
31:19 however which would require uh they were
31:22 estimating
31:23 you know massive earthquakes in order to
31:25 displace these
31:27 these stones because they're so gigantic
31:30 but what it
31:31 the nice thing is it allows us to look
31:33 inside
31:34 the wall to confirm that these walls are
31:36 not only amazing on the outside
31:38 they're amazing all the way through and
31:41 there are parts of south america where
31:43 they have reconstructed a wall
31:48 with rocks that are sort of trapezoidal
31:50 when you look down on top of the mean
31:52 the backs are a little shorter
31:53 or a little little thinner less wide
31:57 than the front and so they stack up all
31:58 the fronts to look like
32:00 the ancient construction of the you know
32:04 pre-incas whoever they were but it's all
32:07 fake on the backside so they put mortar
32:09 in the back and mud and sand and stuff
32:11 to fake it but there are
32:16 probably one of the most amazing areas
32:18 uh
32:19 or things he revealed about this um sort
32:22 of mexico area
32:24 were these what he calls um
32:27 out of place artifacts and what that
32:30 means is they have found something that
32:32 is most definitely
32:33 handmade amazing and there's one that's
32:36 like a
32:37 all i can say is for those of you who
32:39 have seen like square
32:40 bolts where the head is just square
32:45 it looks like a gigantic
32:48 sort of plug with a very
32:51 rectangular head on it with these kind
32:54 of
32:54 wave lines carved in it looks artistic
32:57 but that
32:58 could be for a big screwdriver for all i
33:00 know right and then this gigantic you
33:02 know
33:03 sort of where the rivets would be it's
33:05 not rivets but it's something else but
33:07 it looks like a gigantic plug
33:09 and it looks at least like a ton based
33:11 on everything else he's estimated
33:15 and it's like a cool three and a half
33:17 feet tall
33:19 his wife's standing next to it she's
33:20 five four and it's huge
33:23 and it's precise again and it's complex
33:26 it's not just like
33:28 you know a cut here and there
33:31 so there's a couple of those there are
33:34 some areas where
33:36 inside some of the um
33:40 less fantastical looking things where
33:42 you have sort of a
33:44 um a reconstructed town where they've
33:46 just basically dug out all the
33:48 the dirt so you kind of start seeing
33:50 where the walls were you know it's not
33:52 as emotional as say machu picchu which
33:54 has gigantic reconstruction
33:57 and we still have what the incas did on
33:59 top of the pre-incas
34:01 there are these round
34:04 sort of uh basins next to each other
34:07 usually come in pairs
34:08 and they're beautifully circular and you
34:11 know the locals are like these are just
34:12 used for
34:13 grain and then other locals who are more
34:16 sophisticated are like no no they're
34:18 used by green used
34:20 to grind grain during the day and
34:21 they're used for astronomy at night
34:24 now the bummer about the claim about it
34:27 being something celestial
34:29 is that they didn't really explain how
34:31 it worked i'd love to get in touch with
34:33 this guy and do some 3d work for him so
34:35 that when he does his presentations and
34:36 has a theory
34:38 we can reconstruct the methodology
34:40 because two little holes and
34:41 side stones down below would have to
34:43 take some sort of mechanism to
34:46 you know put a staff in there to see
34:48 what the hell you're looking at
34:50 and then he has what he calls the uh
34:53 obsidian
34:54 artifacts and this is obsidian glass
34:58 that is
34:59 found from a volcano okay so it's a
35:01 local resource
35:03 not a big thing there however
35:07 we have uh slides
35:11 of a little vos it's probably
35:15 about four inches tall maybe three
35:16 inches in diameter
35:18 and it is definitely a spun object
35:21 on a lathe and it is symmetrical
35:24 and it is beautiful it looks like
35:25 something you would get from tiffany's
35:27 today it's black glass
35:29 it's just utterly utterly gorgeous
35:32 beside that on the wall with behind this
35:34 glass case are these other
35:36 black discs made of the same stuff
35:39 also absolutely precise looks like a
35:41 little cd
35:42 in fact it looks like a honestly it
35:45 looks like a tiny 45 record
35:47 except for the label would be in the
35:48 middle imagine that
35:50 size of a 45 label being knocked
35:52 completely out
35:54 tremendous and imagine you go and you're
35:57 looking at things and you're you're not
35:59 putting two and two together
36:00 because you're not a geologist you're
36:02 not an archaeologist an anthropologist
36:04 you're looking at things going
36:06 uh there's a glass face there whatever
36:09 and you're missing the whole point
36:11 you're missing the fact that we don't
36:12 know how the hell they made these things
36:14 the technology to spin that thing while
36:16 it's hot
36:17 because you see people blow glass with
36:19 those with the rods they do it all by
36:21 hand
36:22 well you know it is sometimes stuff can
36:24 look very symmetrical but when you put a
36:26 little
36:26 micron ruler there it's not symmetrical
36:30 but this stuff is beautiful amazing
36:34 he also goes to this case in the same
36:38 place and i don't this was black but it
36:41 didn't look glassy to me maybe it's
36:43 still the obsidian glass
36:45 but imagine a very
36:49 small um
36:52 reel-to-reel case so for those of you
36:55 who know
36:56 reel-to-reels back in the 70s especially
36:58 the kind that they would use for
37:00 big um big recordings back in the day
37:03 once they started getting multi-track
37:04 recording
37:05 you have a tape that's about an inch and
37:08 a half to two inches thick right
37:10 big fat tape and then you have the reel
37:12 to rail that's recording everything
37:13 that's going on
37:14 so take that reel the reel and shrink it
37:17 down to about a
37:19 four to five inch diameter
37:23 across and still leave it about an inch
37:26 and a half
37:27 thick well it's there's a case of these
37:30 these sort of real-to-real things
37:32 sitting in this
37:34 glass case and again you might look
37:35 getting a big deal
37:39 but he just happened to have a
37:40 mechanical engineer with him
37:42 and he goes dude how how would we make
37:45 these today i mean
37:46 and you know he's like well this so you
37:48 can look down in the case
37:50 so you see them from top down so you see
37:52 these kind of like real to real things
37:53 there's nothing in them right of course
37:55 and they have a hole directly to the
37:56 center there's your leg okay
37:58 and then he gets down and uh looks
38:00 through them
38:01 you know so you can see the center part
38:03 of it and he's like these things are
38:05 perfect
38:07 this is definitely a machined object
38:08 it's definitely spun on a lathe there's
38:10 no way you can create this kind of stuff
38:11 by hand
38:13 okay just you know something food for
38:16 thought man you know it's crazy
38:20 also in mexico city you do have a
38:22 gigantic statue
38:24 which i guess is bath salts and you know
38:28 it's two pieces it's and the biggest
38:30 piece is a big square
38:32 sort of etched looks very mayan sort of
38:35 thing
38:36 and it's gigantic and it sort of is in
38:39 the middle between oh my god there's a
38:40 big giant stone here that is sort of
38:42 you know monolithic or megalithic from
38:45 that era
38:46 but but it's a statue of a character so
38:49 that actually is art
38:50 so is it that the statue was made out of
38:53 the block
38:55 that was brought for a particular reason
38:57 don't know
39:00 and the the reals are in the uh halapa
39:04 museum
39:05 just just for the fact here then he
39:07 moves over to easter island
39:10 and easter island has seen a lot of
39:11 action in the last 10 years right
39:13 they're finally digging out those heads
39:15 and for those of you don't know what
39:16 easter island is or you've heard it
39:17 you're
39:18 like okay i can't remember what that is
39:19 where the easter bunny lives and the
39:21 answer would be yes
39:23 it's 2 000 miles off the coast of peru
39:27 in the pacific ocean now i have a
39:31 mandela effect it was off the coast of
39:33 africa but it's probably just my bad
39:35 memory
39:37 but the easter island thing is you know
39:41 i mean i want to break down the anatomy
39:43 of this because easter island is a great
39:45 place to do it because this has happened
39:46 to every place that i've named
39:48 and that everybody ever visits
39:52 when you have an exotic location like
39:55 easter island again
39:56 two thousand miles away from the nearest
39:58 coast
39:59 it has stones that are made of i mean
40:02 if heads that are made of stones that
40:04 are more than twelve thousand miles away
40:06 you know when you have something like
40:08 that you're going to have a lot of
40:09 television shows
40:11 that i want to go there and film and
40:14 they're going to
40:15 have producers that may do a good job
40:18 bringing folks that know what's going on
40:19 there and they may do a horrible job
40:22 but when they get back in the studio and
40:23 they start cutting the show
40:25 wherever they've screwed up science
40:26 because they'll do research after they
40:28 filmed everything
40:29 they'll either voice it over and fix it
40:31 or they'll go with some sensationalized
40:33 theory
40:35 but they're always looking for solutions
40:37 and they don't really care if they get
40:38 it all wrong
40:39 you know i have seen recently in the
40:42 last five to ten years
40:43 obviously the uh the footage of them
40:45 totally digging out
40:46 several of these heads which apparently
40:50 all the heads face inward all the way
40:53 around the
40:54 island and but there's seven of them
40:57 that face out to the ocean
40:59 didn't know that personally i thought
41:01 they all looked like they were going
41:02 outward
41:05 there's all kinds of theories about
41:06 easter island you know over
41:10 harvesting you know they got the
41:11 population out of control they ate all
41:13 the indigenous land
41:14 uh you know food from the land killed
41:16 all the animals forgot to breed
41:19 it seems strange that they have the
41:20 capability of of
41:23 living there but not the brilliance to
41:25 sustain it but you know how it works
41:27 look at today our generations are
41:30 forgetting everything because they just
41:31 keep getting dumber and dumber as they
41:33 move forward right
41:35 hopefully there's you know plenty of
41:37 hope and the exceptions
41:39 but we have a pre-polynesian
41:43 group of people that run easter island
41:45 and then you have the polynesians that
41:46 show up
41:47 and then you have i believe a dutch man
41:49 that shows up in the 1700s
41:52 and there's so there's this evolution of
41:54 what's going on
41:57 what's interesting about the heads is
41:58 that the heads are used to sort of
42:01 measure okay where'd the rock come from
42:05 what did the face facial structure uh
42:08 look like
42:09 because you have polynesians that have a
42:11 very uniform look
42:12 for the most part i'm sure they can see
42:14 more than we can see
42:16 but overall there's a certain look to a
42:18 polynesian person
42:20 and then until you see someone else's
42:24 appearance let's say you're polynesian
42:26 and you can't grow a beard
42:28 well you may not think beards exist and
42:30 then you see a bearded dutchman
42:32 show up and you're like oh my god what
42:33 the hell's up on you what's that on your
42:35 face you know
42:36 and you won't create any sculptures to
42:39 account for
42:40 the bridge of the nose being european um
42:43 facial hair that kind of stuff so these
42:45 heads are actually way more interesting
42:47 than they first appear
42:50 i would say artistically speaking that
42:53 they are the most
42:54 primitive of any recognized
42:58 sculpture on planet earth they're very
43:01 very
43:02 you know basic i don't see anything
43:05 terribly ornate
43:06 with any of the heads that would
43:07 indicate mastery technology
43:10 i think that you do have stones that are
43:14 from very far away
43:16 and you could be just simply dealing
43:18 with a situation where
43:22 the stones are brought there with the
43:24 anticipation to build something
43:26 and they're not used for that and
43:29 eventually they're carved into these
43:30 faces
43:31 who knows right
43:34 now the other thing that's interesting
43:36 is a lot of the basalt
43:38 heads that are built that are carved
43:41 there
43:42 aren't from far away the interesting
43:44 thing is they're under water
43:46 50 to 300 feet and so
43:50 the idea that anyone was able to labor a
43:52 quarry under ocean
43:54 water is pretty hard to believe and so
43:57 you have this theory
43:59 that the oceans were potentially 360
44:04 feet
44:05 lower than they are today thus allowing
44:07 atlantis to exist
44:09 thus when a fills up for some reason
44:13 you lose previous locations and this
44:16 would explain a lot of the stuff that
44:17 graham hancock
44:18 has uncovered off the coast of japan
44:21 there are cities under water so this
44:24 most definitely was the case that
44:26 land was a lot uh more exposed
44:31 now the other thing that he talks about
44:32 which is utterly phenomenal and i
44:34 it's something that with the i don't
44:37 know
44:37 how many the tens of thousands of pages
44:41 i've read about cosmology and my
44:42 research since the early 80s as a kid
44:46 you're never told that in a perfect
44:49 solar system
44:50 and i don't even know if this is exactly
44:51 true but it sort of makes sense
44:53 let's say you had this lower system that
44:55 we live in today
44:58 form naturally without any interruptions
45:00 from the outside
45:02 part of the galaxy or the universe or
45:03 whatever and i know a bunch of you are
45:05 going to be typing in two seconds there
45:06 is no space hey dude i did that episode
45:08 first on the internet
45:09 period let's just say it exists okay
45:14 the earth is tilted around 23 degrees
45:18 well here's what's fascinating in the
45:20 second five hours
45:23 he shows you
45:26 structures that if the world hadn't
45:28 tilted
45:29 23 degrees these structures would
45:32 perfectly
45:33 predict summer equinox winter equinox
45:36 where the sun's going to be
45:38 blah blah blah and it seems to be off
45:41 23 degrees as if in a perfect universe
45:45 spun up however this thing occurs earth
45:48 was straight up and down
45:51 and these structures were built aligning
45:54 with the sun
45:55 the moon and the stars and then
45:57 something happens and boom
45:59 it turns around and this is where we get
46:02 into
46:04 the initial theory we're going to loop
46:07 back
46:08 onto the pyramids before this is over
46:11 so plato we all know if you studied
46:14 atlantis to any degree we know that
46:15 plato wrote about atlantis
46:17 and these were rumors that he had heard
46:20 that were potentially thousands of years
46:22 old
46:23 potentially ten thousand years before he
46:26 was born
46:27 just oral history moving down talks
46:29 about this
46:32 but we have this weird situation that
46:36 we know through bones especially from
46:39 carcasses in siberia that megafauna
46:44 like saber-toothed tigers
46:48 woolly mammoths those kind of things
46:50 disappeared very quickly
46:52 yet their population were in the
46:54 millions
46:55 the one thing that's very interesting is
46:57 is that um i didn't put this together
46:59 until recently is that
47:00 the mayans are revered for the fact that
47:04 their
47:05 you know their written language their
47:07 symbolic language some of the most
47:08 ornate in the world
47:10 if not the most ornate script scripting
47:13 in the planet
47:14 but they seem to have elephants all
47:16 throughout their
47:17 symbolism their icons their language
47:22 but there's no elephants on the in the
47:24 americas
47:26 and so i heard that first and this is
47:28 where you'll have two pieces of
47:29 information and your brain takes a long
47:30 time to go but
47:32 wait and it kind of connects them
47:33 together right
47:35 and some of you already know this so
47:37 you're like oh yeah that's really weird
47:39 you know when did that happen
47:41 okay well you go to los angeles tar pits
47:45 los angeles tar pits are all about the
47:47 woolly mammoths that are down at the
47:49 bottom and
47:50 they're found all over the place right
47:52 and they're you know this is where you
47:53 get a lot of like
47:54 dinosaur sort of theory being confirmed
47:56 but you're really finding a creature
47:58 that's only 12 000 years old
48:00 still an amazing situation but they're
48:02 not dinosaurs okay
48:04 but in siberia they have thousands of
48:08 of megafauna that have been caught
48:11 especially wooly mammoths with
48:13 undigested
48:14 food in their mouth and in their bellies
48:18 is if they were flash
48:20 frozen
48:23 now what they typically will theorize is
48:26 that they have fallen down inside a
48:28 crevice
48:29 or as tenacious d calls it the crevasse
48:32 and they freeze except that in
48:35 my observation of these
48:39 uh examinations you don't have broken
48:42 femurs and broken bones and things
48:44 which would be a result of some sort of
48:48 you know big fall but maybe it's a
48:49 little fall who knows and you see it all
48:51 the time where
48:52 elephants get their self stuck in pits
48:54 and things like that
48:56 but there was a book written in the 50s
48:59 called
49:00 1950s called cataclysm
49:03 and it theorized that 9 500 bc
49:06 which you know at the 2000 we've already
49:08 lived you're getting right
49:10 close to his 12 000 um
49:13 bc theory
49:17 did some sort of comment or something
49:19 entered our solar system
49:22 for those of your uh planet x people get
49:24 your bong out and start smoking
49:26 but here comes the comment it comes
49:29 through
49:30 and it is so gigantic and so violent
49:33 that it actually yanks all the planets
49:35 and
49:36 weird axes
49:40 and they they attribute the asteroid
49:43 belt between
49:44 mars and jupiter to this and the
49:45 asteroid belt between mars and jupiter
49:47 which
49:47 you know we have to take nasa's word for
49:49 it existing
49:50 seriously because there's no way to
49:51 really see it easily
49:54 it's such a massive ring it is the
49:57 orbit between mars and jupiter it's
50:00 massive
50:00 and to deposit that much
50:04 matter in a ring
50:07 it's uh you know all combined that ring
50:10 should should be as big as the sun and
50:13 just be a big rock it'd be some huge
50:15 thing
50:18 you know so it's a grain of salt on that
50:20 one
50:22 but then the one of the contributors to
50:24 the cataclysm book
50:26 came out with another book which was um
50:29 cataclysm phobia or something like that
50:31 and she took it to the next level
50:33 saying that because of this thing that
50:36 occurred
50:37 and they almost write it you know like
50:39 they've got some secret book of
50:40 knowledge or something like that
50:43 but because of the world turning where
50:45 you have essentially
50:46 you know cold goes to hot hot goes to
50:48 cold things are getting flash frozen
50:51 just like you know we've had this happen
50:53 in the midwest in the last 10 years
50:55 they're kind of exercising their hard
50:56 capabilities or whatever they're doing
51:00 you know where cattle just freezes
51:02 standing up
51:03 but the woman started the idea that
51:07 after 12 000
51:09 or 10 000 bc that we had to crawl into
51:12 caves to simply to survive because
51:14 of the vegetation being so destroyed by
51:16 this
51:17 cataclysm now
51:20 you know the only thing i could possibly
51:22 imagine would be
51:23 you would have to have fairly super
51:26 unaffected areas of the world for anyone
51:28 to survive at all and petra is actually
51:30 interesting because it's
51:31 down in that you know ravine between the
51:34 rocks
51:35 maybe that's a natural way to survive
51:37 things plus it's fairly equatorial
51:39 so not a problem right
51:42 but the idea that you've got snow cover
51:44 outside
51:46 for a particular tribe that is never
51:48 experienced snow before
51:50 and they're somehow finding you know
51:52 vegetation growing underneath that they
51:54 can sustain their bodies with
51:56 you know i'd have to read the book to
51:57 figure out kind of what she was thinking
51:59 with that
52:01 but her whole theory is that after about
52:03 6 000 years passes
52:05 around 6000 bc excuse me you have the
52:08 rise of civilization
52:10 because it's a renaissance instead of
52:11 being an initial
52:13 rise of civilization
52:16 you know there's this theory that's been
52:18 you know heavily deprecated now that we
52:20 came out of a single female in the
52:22 and the africas some prehistoric lucy
52:28 and it simply could be that that was one
52:30 of the most lush locations
52:32 on the planet such that we were able to
52:36 survive the cataclysm now
52:41 there's another book earth under fire
52:46 i'm not even gonna try to say this guys
52:47 dr paul something earlier
52:51 his theory is uh
52:56 i i don't know how this this works again
52:59 it's
52:59 sort of leaning on a bedrock of
53:03 it would always be like writing a book
53:04 about atlantis but your key
53:06 witness is a person channeling an alien
53:09 from
53:09 you know outer space or something like
53:11 that but this theory was that um
53:14 you know one
53:19 when i say this i say this and i i want
53:21 to laugh out loud
53:24 because everything i'm about to say is
53:25 completely absurd absolutely everything
53:27 i'm about to say
53:28 not a part of it every bit of it right
53:31 that our galaxy doesn't have a black
53:33 hole in the center
53:34 insert last track it has a
53:38 pulsar in the middle insert second left
53:41 track
53:42 and if this pulsar routinely
53:45 on some epoch you know
53:48 blows out this gigantic wave
53:52 of plasma
53:56 just all throughout the galaxy in all
53:58 directions
53:59 and then obviously a little spibble of
54:01 it hits earth
54:03 and i would it would have to be a
54:04 microscopic spibble
54:06 from the center of the galaxy okay
54:09 one it would take a tremendous amount of
54:12 time
54:13 to get here it wasn't isn't the galaxy
54:16 the number always changes so i will tell
54:18 you what i was told in high school
54:20 that if you were to travel across the
54:22 diameter of our galaxy
54:24 it would take something on the order of
54:26 like 210 million light years
54:29 okay so this whole bs about it being
54:32 some cycle and all happens automatically
54:34 it would have to
54:35 go with an electrical universe model
54:37 which whatever
54:38 then the pulsar disappears then the
54:41 black hole disappears
54:43 gravity is a push on a pole
54:46 which is the truth but they called it
54:50 the galactic super wave
54:52 you know you have to have a really cool
54:53 name for your car grease lightning baby
54:56 so then forrester put a book on top of
54:59 that where he really endorses that now
55:01 i think what's interesting is attaching
55:03 yourself to crazy to get your book off
55:05 the ground is unnecessary
55:07 simply write about what you observe
55:10 he has proven to be on the shadow of a
55:11 doubt that an electrical well excuse me
55:14 a very high temperature 2000
55:16 celsius plus wave of heat
55:20 has destroyed things around the world
55:21 petra's got burn marks
55:23 um around the machu picchu area of peru
55:27 they have some burn marks but egypt is
55:29 just
55:29 cratered with gigantic waves of of
55:33 really
55:34 super hot something rather
55:37 but the other thing is is that they
55:39 don't realize or recognize
55:41 that the earth has a plasma core so
55:44 brian forrester
55:45 sitting there believing probably the
55:47 nickel iron theory
55:49 which makes no sense because it lose
55:50 magnetism uh 6500 degrees fahrenheit and
55:53 therefore
55:54 the poles don't make any sense but if
55:56 you just fill it with what the sun's
55:57 full of
55:58 which is what the moon's full of oh my
55:59 gosh you have an ecosystem and it's
56:01 called electrical
56:02 universe theory and it's what the
56:04 pyramids are based off of
56:06 it's what tesla's thing was based off of
56:08 and probably the dude from coral castle
56:10 okay i won't go into it again
56:14 but they're playing with electricity
56:16 they're building pyramids all over the
56:17 place they're you know who knows what
56:19 was going on with the previous
56:20 construction
56:21 in the americas but just
56:24 in egypt okay they're starting to
56:28 siphon out of the ground a potentially
56:32 limitless supply of plasma because as we
56:35 use our plasma
56:37 the sun is injecting it on a subatomic
56:39 level on an ether level
56:41 and so we're never going to run out it's
56:44 an ecosystem
56:46 right if you had 10 people in the room
56:49 and you were all sat in a big circle and
56:51 you brought so much
56:52 change with you and maybe even paper
56:54 money and you just keep buying from each
56:56 other and going back and forth and go
56:58 does the money ever disappear no it
57:00 never disappears you can't hide energy
57:02 in the universe and so this is the
57:03 theory but because man
57:05 runs out of resources constantly we tend
57:08 to
57:08 impose those theories on the physics of
57:11 the universe and there's no such thing
57:15 so let's say they're constantly building
57:18 i mean there are
57:19 hundreds and hundreds of bent pyramids
57:22 regular pyramids
57:23 their pyramids bigger than i believe
57:25 than the giza plateau
57:27 pyramids like the great pyramid but
57:29 they're they're deconstructed
57:33 what forester gets into is the idea that
57:37 these
57:37 pyramids overloaded
57:40 they simply brought too much electricity
57:42 up and you know how siphons work
57:45 now when you're siphoning water from a
57:47 tank
57:48 using a hose and you're pulling on it
57:50 and you're blowing water out
57:52 then it's limited by literally the
57:55 diameter of the hose that's your maximum
57:58 you can put more pressure in it and get
57:59 more out more amperage
58:01 but when you don't have a hose when you
58:04 have an open
58:06 aperture to the center of the earth
58:08 right how big is the pyramid compared to
58:10 the center of the earth which is
58:11 probably a figure eight
58:13 surrounded by a van allen belt in the
58:15 internals
58:16 this is the natural way the electricity
58:18 flows you're gonna get a lot more than
58:20 you can handle
58:23 so what i would love forester to do is
58:25 to document
58:27 the direction of the blast
58:30 and then map all the pyramids everywhere
58:33 on planet earth and see if
58:35 in one particular day all these things
58:37 networked
58:38 one particular day it just said okay you
58:41 want it i'm going to give it to you
58:43 boom and you get a trillion volts of
58:45 electricity out of the ground
58:47 which then melts all the pyramids
58:51 he was saying that i don't mean all the
58:53 way to the ground but the
58:55 the encapsulating limestone
58:58 just blows off could technically
59:01 evaporate
59:03 it's not it's it's strong to carve
59:06 but it's not strong for electricity to
59:07 liquefy
59:10 now we you would think you would see um
59:12 some very intense
59:14 evidence of such things maybe erosion
59:16 helps don't know
59:19 but he starts going back to egypt and
59:22 you know it was some pretty interesting
59:23 stuff because
59:24 you know for me personally just seeing a
59:26 bunch of stuff from the valley of the
59:27 kings and
59:28 the valley of the queens and never
59:29 thinking about
59:31 more than what i'm being taught his
59:34 assertion which i think has a lot of
59:38 good rationale is that
59:42 this stuff was discovered by the
59:44 dynastic period
59:45 individuals and he said that you know
59:48 look at a lot of the paint work
59:50 in the valley of the kings and the
59:51 valley of the queens
59:53 it's a lot of it's just a paint that's
59:56 been applied to a flat wall
59:58 and then drawn on that are hieroglyphs
60:03 and that looks like someone found it
60:06 didn't want to disturb it because it was
60:07 made by the gods but we're going to
60:09 paint on it
60:10 and we're going to turn these into tombs
60:11 somebody goes i mean i would like to be
60:13 buried here you know
60:16 so you know walt disney for instance
60:18 died without knowing he was going to die
60:19 in 1865
60:21 but he was a carlsbad canyon fan which
60:23 is why
60:24 the pirates of the caribbean are modeled
60:26 after the carlsbad canyon
60:28 but now imagine he knew he was going to
60:30 die and he goes look i'll just be buried
60:31 in the girls back can you
60:32 and they go yeah yeah sure whatever uh
60:34 to kind of hide your body and stuff but
60:36 okay we'll work it out whatever
60:37 so if you knew these places exist you
60:39 get yourself buried there
60:42 but he suggests this theory by showing
60:44 you
60:45 that there's definitely sort of
60:48 a straight line of construction
60:52 from the valley of the queens and
60:54 there's another one on the other side of
60:55 this
60:56 mountain for the valley of the kings
60:57 coming down towards the valley of the
60:59 queens
61:00 and when he did this little aerial shot
61:02 it's not terribly great but he goes look
61:04 it looks like these two things might be
61:05 connected with underground caverns
61:07 because he's been in the caverns
61:08 underneath the giza plateau
61:10 he's like trust me man he was only went
61:12 four stories down
61:15 but it was almost like 300 feet because
61:18 every store is like 60 feet it's not
61:19 like
61:20 us building a 12 foot to 14 foot story
61:22 on a building in our time frame
61:24 but he was told that he only got to the
61:26 fourth level underneath the plateau
61:28 and the locals said yeah there's 10 more
61:30 down below
61:32 amazing right he also went
61:36 back into the sphinx now i covered most
61:38 of this in the first
61:39 episode about the water erosion
61:42 about the possibility of chambers inside
61:44 of the sphinx
61:45 he did show a new slide where he walked
61:48 around the back of the sphinx
61:50 with his guide and he took this grill
61:53 off the back of the uh
61:56 of the sphinx itself and there was a pit
61:59 that black as night
62:00 where you could climb down in it you'd
62:02 have to be pretty small guy to do it but
62:04 there's something there
62:08 but he shows you that you know in front
62:10 of the pause
62:13 of the sphinx you have a wood deck now
62:17 all of a sudden and he said you know
62:19 that's uh
62:20 because he said this is me talking on
62:22 his behalf he said that
62:24 they were told that um by the
62:27 local guides that that is actually not a
62:29 plank to protect anything it's because
62:31 they're now
62:32 excavating underneath the paws and they
62:34 don't anyone to know
62:35 so they put that on top to hide what
62:38 they're doing
62:40 interesting now he also shows
62:44 you know some of the abandoned obelisks
62:46 and i guess
62:47 one of the biggest abandoned structures
62:51 on this planet is a 1200
62:55 ton obelisk which severally most likely
62:58 seen in different
62:59 specials but i don't know that i ever
63:01 heard there was 1200 tons i mean that is
63:03 just
63:04 it's just massive man and it doesn't
63:07 appear to have any structural issues a
63:09 lot of them will break
63:10 you know but some of them are actually
63:12 perfect you just don't know why they
63:13 were abandoned
63:16 sometimes they'll dig down and find out
63:17 that the the
63:19 limestone that they're going to be using
63:22 to create this
63:23 has a horizontal crack across the entire
63:27 structure
63:27 from some sedimentary issues they find
63:29 out that this thing will never hold
63:31 together because it's cracked
63:33 and it's just a basic maybe even a water
63:36 weight it was underneath there
63:37 but i will show you one slide the heat
63:40 just glossed over man
63:42 unbelievable it was it's it's hard to
63:45 describe it has a pyramid on top it's
63:47 lying on its side it's a big rock
63:49 it looks to me to be somewhere in the
63:51 neighborhood of like
63:52 10 to 12 foot rectangle
63:55 okay but inside the rectangle just like
63:58 an old man who does the uh the carving
64:01 inside a block of wood to create a
64:03 chamber inside you know like a sphere
64:05 or something it's got sort of um
64:08 like a pagoda like a know a little room
64:12 inside there but on top is the most
64:13 precise
64:15 freaking pyramid ever it just looks out
64:18 of place it looks like it was built
64:19 yesterday
64:20 you know so i don't know why he just
64:23 glossed over that
64:25 so this particular
64:28 seven hour thing the summation of it is
64:32 actually twofold so you you have this
64:36 profound understanding
64:39 that all over the world you've got
64:40 gigantic stone
64:42 construction which blows the mind
64:45 with sort of more recent stuff built on
64:48 top
64:49 in every case nobody knows who the
64:51 previous people were because it is so
64:53 far
64:54 back that everything's been erased by an
64:56 event
64:59 now for my money he's onto something
65:01 with the burn marks
65:04 which appear to be in a lot of places
65:07 now we also know that kelming
65:11 er is a process by which you can trap
65:13 fire
65:14 and get super duper hot things to occur
65:18 but it doesn't mean that a cataclysmic
65:23 super wave came from space and burned
65:26 everything up
65:28 but the one the the burn marks i saw
65:31 in south america look like it could have
65:34 been some experiment
65:35 in cooking things you know for those of
65:38 you that
65:40 i'll just give an example i read an
65:43 article
65:44 25 years ago 30 years ago talking about
65:46 pizza sometimes
65:48 leaves your mouth like captain crunch
65:50 all stringy
65:52 and they said that you need to
65:53 understand that in the layers of
65:55 crust on a pizza
65:58 it can store like 400 degree
66:00 temperatures for a very long time
66:02 because of the way it's layered
66:04 so that's kelm technology anywhere
66:05 you've dealt with blowing glass
66:07 firing pottery you know that with you
66:09 know
66:10 just some wood and a shaped stove
66:13 without electricity or anything else you
66:14 can get to thousands of degrees so
66:17 it's not like they couldn't have lumped
66:19 rocks together not realizing what they
66:20 were doing and then they score some
66:22 things
66:23 but that doesn't explain the stuff in
66:24 egypt where these
66:26 statues appear to be blasted apart
66:29 knocked down you know rock will explode
66:32 sometimes because it has
66:34 air bubbles in it that then boil and
66:36 then pop you know there's that very
66:38 special rock that at least in america
66:41 it's white and it's very porous
66:44 it's very swiss cheesy and when you're
66:46 boy scouts or cub scouts they'll teach
66:48 you
66:48 don't never use that rock to build a
66:51 fire because it
66:52 explodes plenty of you heard logs
66:55 explode in the fire
66:57 so you know who knows exactly how all
66:59 this stuff happens
67:01 but we have a gigantic part of our
67:05 history that is simply missing
67:08 and what's interesting is we don't have
67:10 anything beyond
67:12 that that we've discovered so what's
67:14 interesting about that is we have this
67:16 laser-focused
67:18 question that we can ask globally
67:21 who built these structures
67:25 who built them in americas who built
67:27 them on africa
67:29 you know turkey has some amazing things
67:31 as well
67:33 there is stonehenge stonehenge for me
67:35 has been so manipulated
67:37 so changed only a british person is
67:40 hanging on to
67:41 any theory of what the hell that is but
67:43 it was there in a different location in
67:45 late 1800s
67:46 and then 1954 they started to move the
67:50 stones and reconstruct them
67:51 doesn't mean it wasn't what it was but
67:54 then you have these creepy druids show
67:56 up and go no it's definitely ours it's
67:57 like oh it's definitely yours huh
68:00 oh totally we're just all druid devil
68:02 worshiping crap
68:03 okay you know don't watch me i'm making
68:05 a joke
68:06 but how come when it was a pile of rock
68:08 over there the druids never showed up
68:11 you know and why haven't you built a
68:13 bunch of these things
68:15 since then you don't have to build them
68:16 out of gigantic stones but where all
68:18 your druid churches look exactly
68:19 stonehenge
68:20 before stonehenge existed 1954 is pretty
68:22 late in the game man
68:24 you know but either earth is still
68:26 already been made buck rogers had
68:27 already been made
68:30 so i i just don't have any real interest
68:33 in stonehenge at all it'd be like you
68:36 know the pyramids removed from uh the
68:37 giza plateau to havasu california and
68:40 it's like oh
68:40 when should i worship them here because
68:41 this is where they were built and it's
68:43 like
68:44 but we have something here and it's just
68:46 getting better and better and better
68:47 we're
68:48 we're at the infancy of the whole game
68:50 which is interesting
68:52 any one of you hearing my voice that has
68:54 the ability to travel in this world
68:57 at least after the american election
68:58 when the world will suddenly lose covid
69:03 you will be able to if you would like
69:06 to get involved with these programs to
69:08 to just go there on your own just get a
69:10 ticket and go
69:11 there's nothing i'm seeing from brian
69:13 forrester that looks
69:15 impossible he's buying plane tickets and
69:18 he's going places
69:20 now it did down on me that he said that
69:21 he had been to machu picchu 68 times and
69:25 i didn't really think about that
69:26 until i thought wait a minute how old
69:28 are you most people would only go once a
69:30 year if you were going every if you went
69:32 twice a year
69:33 then it would take you 34 years to go
69:36 there he's not that old i mean he's
69:37 definitely in his 50s but
69:39 um he must be counting every day that he
69:41 goes to bed and gets up and goes
69:43 back to the location so i guess that's
69:47 uh
69:48 it i'll just say this much for my
69:50 credibility
69:51 if i bought a uh a two-day pass to
69:54 disneyland i would not tell you that i
69:56 went there
69:56 two times this week i would say i went
69:58 there one time for two days
70:00 that kind of thing the interesting thing
70:04 about these locations
70:07 is that you have a lot of very caring
70:11 archaeologists today that aren't linked
70:14 to a museum they're not linked to a
70:15 government agenda
70:16 a historical agenda that all they want
70:19 to do is just dig
70:20 down very gently and think about all the
70:23 digital photography we have think about
70:25 all the
70:26 the subterranean sonic indicators we can
70:30 we can paint a picture of what's in the
70:31 ground before we dig anything out and
70:33 just goes okay
70:34 there's that wild statue we can see it
70:36 right there it's got a face on it
70:39 doesn't appear to be anything in the
70:41 ground at all not a
70:42 not a hair that's coming up on this
70:44 radar for three feet so we can
70:47 fairly aggressively go down at least two
70:49 and a half feet we want to slow down
70:51 um you know and we could dig this stuff
70:54 out and try to find out who the hell we
70:55 are
70:57 but it's ganked by local agencies
71:01 government agencies i mean i guarantee
71:03 you the arabs will never want to admit
71:04 they found the pyramids
71:07 as if somehow it's going to divorce them
71:09 from being from the area or being a part
71:11 of the dynastic era
71:13 of egypt it doesn't it just says look
71:16 you found
71:17 some pretty cool stuff here for some
71:20 reason
71:21 these people got wiped out let's all
71:24 work together
71:26 so yeah so if you're interested
71:31 i want to seed your brain that you could
71:33 buy a ticket
71:34 you want to go call someone like a
71:36 forester to get all the
71:37 good you know this is where you can go
71:40 this is where you can't go put this on
71:41 don't eat that
71:42 you know you have to wear this over your
71:44 face or whatever it is don't talk to
71:46 those guys talk to those guys
71:48 get all that put together bring your
71:49 money whatever
71:51 and you can contribute whatever
71:52 expertise you have
71:55 it's all about connections it's about
71:57 spending time there taking photographs
72:00 looking around trying to make things you
72:01 know see if things
72:03 can connect the amount of evidence that
72:07 high technology was used it's just it's
72:10 just conclusive
72:11 absolutely conclusive there's something
72:13 there
72:14 and let me let me just close with this
72:16 idea
72:20 what if
72:23 and there's a couple ways i could pitch
72:24 this movie story at you
72:28 but let's say that you saw
72:31 something super intelligent in the sky
72:33 it's dancing in front of you and it
72:35 appears to have talked to you
72:37 you know it seems like you were it means
72:39 like i'm not hunting the beach right now
72:40 i'm staring in the direction that the
72:42 beach is at
72:43 three and a half miles away it's ocean
72:45 okay so say i see something while i'm
72:46 filming a show and i'm like okay move
72:48 right move left and it's doing
72:49 everything that i say
72:50 and then it hauls ass out of my screen
72:54 then all of a sudden cairo calls the
72:57 press
72:58 and says we just had an unidentified
73:00 flying object
73:01 embed itself into the ground
73:05 at giza
73:08 and you know it seems to have buried
73:10 itself down so we're going to start
73:12 you know trying to dig down and figure
73:14 out what this thing is
73:16 no more energy is coming out of the hole
73:18 now i
73:20 think i've had this personal experience
73:22 with the object i talked to it it did
73:23 what i asked it to do it answered
73:25 questions or whatever right the stephen
73:27 greer thing am i going to sit here in
73:31 huntington beach
73:33 or am i going to cairo because i had an
73:35 experience
73:37 maybe i'm the the key master
73:40 to getting this thing to come out of the
73:41 ground so i got to make phone calls i
73:44 got to figure out who's going to believe
73:45 me
73:47 if i had this camera maybe i'll flip it
73:48 around and i get proof right can be
73:50 filming the ground won't really do any
73:51 good but uh
73:53 you hear what i'm saying so if any of
73:55 this appeals to you on that
73:56 that sort of subatomic spiritual level
74:02 then maybe there's something out there
74:03 for you
74:06 anyway i hope you dug that i have
74:08 totally enjoyed this
74:10 i want to go way further than than this
74:14 so we'll perhaps just continue this
74:16 particular
74:17 theme as time goes on and then
74:21 see if we can come up with some
74:22 different epiphanies but if you haven't
74:24 been to detoxradio.com please go
74:26 it's all spruced up it has
74:30 two two video two audio
74:34 four or five social media nowadays with
74:36 parlor
74:37 it has an all new remastered season one
74:40 there's a couple ways to donate thank
74:41 you for
74:42 every single human being that parts with
74:44 the penny of your hard-earned money
74:46 uh the stores uh definitely got a lot
74:49 more traffic recently
74:50 so definitely get your season five stuff
74:54 i'm going to be creating sort of a
74:56 series of shirts that are going to
74:58 sort of be retro um
75:01 shirts for those of you who've been here
75:02 a really long time so you'll be able to
75:03 get a season one shirt two shirts for
75:05 sure just some big og shirt
75:07 and then we'll go on with uh season six
75:10 okay and just just just a little
75:13 footnote here
75:14 because i'm getting a lot of people
75:15 asking me about the tesla thing or do
75:16 you need help what's wrong you know what
75:18 i'm like okay
75:19 here's how the tesla's episode's
75:20 breaking down didn't know this when i
75:22 first started
75:23 i was given a lot of coveted
75:26 diagrams with his handwriting not the
75:28 originals but scans that are just
75:30 unbelievable right it's like literally
75:31 him writing
75:32 how to build towers and things so
75:35 there's that portion of it which is
75:38 fairly understandable
75:39 you know it's it's actually he kept
75:42 things very simple he makes it easy for
75:43 people like
75:44 us to understand he's doing all the hard
75:46 work then there's his life story which
75:49 is sort of his childhood and where he
75:50 was and all that kind of stuff
75:53 which he has an autobiography up to 1919
75:56 and then you have to take it
75:57 with different sources up the other you
75:59 know remaining years until he passed
76:01 away like a 43
76:03 and then you have the just
76:06 metric tons of patents that this guy
76:08 came up with
76:09 and what i have discovered is that his
76:11 patents
76:12 are going in a vector he is going in a
76:16 direction
76:16 they all seem to butt up against each
76:18 other i haven't reached the
76:20 the end of it because i'm dissecting you
76:23 know various
76:24 patents i'm not going to be overwhelming
76:27 folks with
76:28 [Music]
76:29 electronics electrical theory will be
76:32 basically there to sort of make it all
76:34 make sense we've definitely got to go
76:36 through his tesla tower we've got to go
76:37 through the invention of the tesla coil
76:39 what he
76:40 you know was intending on that so it's
76:42 just a tremendous amount of stuff
76:44 tesla created the modern universe and
76:47 there's no way that we can just do a
76:49 little
76:50 yeah he's a pretty guy you know he
76:51 counted his uh how many times he walked
76:53 around a building before he would eat
76:55 see you later can't be like that we got
76:57 to give him some serious juice
77:00 so that's why it's taking a little bit
77:02 longer but that's why i'm satiating you
77:04 in the meantime hopefully
77:06 anyway thank you for your patience love
77:08 you guys to death
77:10 take care of yourself and someone else
77:11 and i'll see you in the next deep
77:13 thoughts
77:14 over now
77:17 [Applause]
77:24 [Applause]
77:30 [Applause]
77:37 [Applause]
77:42 hey
77:54 you
