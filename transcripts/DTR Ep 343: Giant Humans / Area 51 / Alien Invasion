00:00 [Music]
00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen sorry I'm doing a bunch at
00:40 night I know they look like crap when
00:42 they come out not that much of
00:43 environment around the video part but
00:46 the audio is good hopefully so I have
00:48 this you know that feeling I get this
00:50 feeling when I need to create an episode
00:53 and and I got a whole list of episodes I
00:55 want to do but a ton of them needed a
00:57 bunch of research right but some of them
01:02 unfortunately they are sparse for
01:06 information and so I thought I would
01:10 maybe plow through a bunch of them and
01:12 we'll just make sort of a variety show
01:14 within this particular episode because I
01:18 go to my smoke lines like I always say
01:19 to you guys and for those of you don't
01:21 know what I'm talking about it's
01:24 basically a place where you smoke cigars
01:26 and the guys have a humidor with all
01:28 kinds of cigars in there and you go Inez
01:31 sit down and most these humidors slash
01:34 smoke lounges in the world it's usually
01:36 got a 20 TVs and there's a bunch of
01:38 people watching sports and a bunch of
01:40 dudes trying to be as manly as possible
01:42 and it's just like a feeble effort in
01:44 the first place but mine is special
01:48 extremely special it is essentially it's
01:53 a different flavor than deep thoughts
01:54 but it is a conspiracy smoke lounge and
01:59 yes we talk about stuff as if it's
02:02 totally real and we're some of people in
02:05 the room will completely believe it's
02:07 real and others will be just like are we
02:09 really having this conversation you know
02:11 but it happens but we are open-minded
02:15 and we don't get up each other's ass the
02:17 only thing we get up your ass about in
02:19 that place that we don't ever get in
02:22 your face ever but after you leave the
02:25 only criticism that that ever arises and
02:28 it's usually fairly constructive is it
02:30 will say that dude wasn't ready that
02:32 dude wasn't ready to see his face when
02:34 we start talking about that he just
02:35 started drifting off you know many of
02:39 those experiences I've shared with you
02:40 guys so and then you know a lot of times
02:45 stuff that we cover on this show
02:47 including your comments by the way just
02:50 so you know you're at the lounge too so
02:52 when you guys share something cool or
02:54 say a really cool statement I will be at
02:57 the lounge sitting there and you know
02:58 the subject matter will pop up and I'll
03:00 go hey you know one of my listeners said
03:02 this this and this you know it you know
03:04 it ranges from just someone with an
03:07 academic background in something all the
03:10 way over to something where one of you
03:15 is in a different part of the world and
03:17 you're reporting in that's very
03:19 important and so I bring empirical data
03:22 straight into these folks brains then we
03:24 kind of just put that in as a maybe and
03:27 then as we see it on TV we're like oh my
03:30 god that that's exactly what that person
03:32 said so when I say we even though it's
03:36 me on this episode every single time it
03:39 is definitely a group effort but some of
03:43 the subjects I've been wanting to cover
03:44 that again there's just a handful of
03:47 evidence although it is fantastic
03:49 evidence we really just have to sit and
03:51 speculate about the rest of it you know
03:54 I think it was season 3 so 201 episode
04:00 201 is about Bigfoot I think that's the
04:03 right number and you know again I don't
04:06 really have or maybe it's 200 I don't
04:08 have a big interest in Bigfoot but when
04:11 I parsed it on this show all these
04:13 logical things about mating rituals and
04:15 the vulnerability of a female pregnant
04:18 the vulnerability of a female carrying a
04:21 child that is not ready to move having
04:23 to build the nest having to find you
04:25 know male and female having to find each
04:26 other which you know they don't have
04:28 harmony calm right er me calm they got a
04:31 yell and scream the fact that Bigfoot's
04:35 are hominids so hominids can only howl
04:37 it'd be a really loud you know mating
04:41 season let's just put that way and of
04:44 course you know in order to cover up any
04:47 logistical conflicts with biology there
04:51 now interdimensional beings you know
04:52 they just [ __ ] evolves and evolves
04:54 and hey I don't mind some really fun
04:56 entertainment so I don't have anyone
04:59 anything against anyone
05:00 I just would I wouldn't support anybody
05:05 in a beer fight and if I can you know
05:07 cantina brawl trying to throw down that
05:10 it's real right you're on your own but
05:12 but one of the things that comes with
05:15 sort of your morph and I want to say
05:17 fringe but not fringe because it's
05:19 untrue fringe because it's not being
05:21 reported the notion of giants used to
05:28 walk this planet now for those of you
05:31 who've never heard this before man that
05:34 that can really throw you off you don't
05:35 have any reference in your mind when I
05:37 say giant we're talking probably the
05:42 shortest full-grown person would be
05:45 about eight to nine feet and the
05:48 speculation and the claims go all the
05:53 way up into 20-foot beings even 25-foot
05:57 beings never heard much beyond the
06:00 25-foot threshold and if you study it
06:05 what you'll study is that the Native
06:07 Americans when asked were a lot of these
06:10 structures were coming from but they
06:12 would find the settlers at some point
06:14 and I think this is really primarily in
06:18 the like I would say early to mid 1800s
06:24 they'd say well you know the giant
06:27 people built this stuff and they say
06:29 what are you talking about they say well
06:30 they came here before us and there's
06:32 there's whole graveyards of their of
06:34 their bones of their skeletons and so
06:38 they take all these you know academics
06:41 from Europe to these locations they'd
06:43 excavate them and take them away and
06:47 then document them in books under the
06:50 heading of the Smithsonian and then
06:54 they'd lose them all transport them
06:56 probably Europe or whatever now the
07:00 books exist okay now whether or not some
07:04 anthropologist is trying to create
07:06 another paleontology thing where you
07:09 know we're believing in something again
07:10 it's not being pushed by anything out
07:12 there
07:13 but there's some interesting
07:15 correlations there's one interesting
07:16 correlation with my personal childhood
07:18 back in Kansas and when they started
07:21 breaking down the anatomy of these giant
07:24 human beings and again carnivals have
07:26 had big giant skeletons or bodies that
07:32 hadn't fully decomposed that they would
07:33 transport around in these wooden caskets
07:36 and they'd be on display they've been
07:37 embalmed and they were definitely tall
07:40 human beings but nothing taller than the
07:42 tallest human being that walked this
07:44 earth which also he came to my hometown
07:47 at one point my grandmother stood next
07:48 to him that eight-foot guy they're not
07:51 9-foot guy or whatever he was right and
07:54 we got basketball players that are big
07:56 big now but one of the physical
07:57 characteristics that they said which
08:02 triggered something in my brain from my
08:04 past was they said that these one that
08:07 they look like Homo sapiens sapiens so
08:09 like they had fully articulated skulls
08:11 they mean they could talk right they
08:14 could do their syllables and but they
08:18 said that they had two rows of teeth in
08:22 their head and you can just look it up
08:24 on the internet and find pictures of
08:26 this but I had a kid in my hometown it
08:28 was anything but a giant but then again
08:29 he was a child I think I was four four
08:32 or five years old my four through six
08:35 somewhere in there and they used to you
08:37 know I don't know about you and you were
08:39 a kid but when some kid had a weird
08:41 thing he'd be a little star for his
08:44 weirdness right he little you know a
08:45 good celebrity and so this kid had two
08:48 rows of teeth on the bottom and the top
08:50 and they pushed him around and I don't
08:53 know who this kid was I I have to assume
08:55 he moved away because I only saw this
08:57 one time but they said you know show him
09:00 your teeth man show him your teeth I can
09:02 still see it to my to this day and I
09:03 remember looking inside this kid's mouth
09:04 and he had two rows of [ __ ] teeth
09:06 baby teeth but he still Adam now there
09:11 was talk about I guess you neutralized
09:15 the back row surgically killing the buds
09:18 but you have to let the baby teeth fall
09:20 out then you neutralized the buds and
09:21 then you only get your permanent teeth I
09:22 guess was the thing this kid was trying
09:24 to say in so many words but then the
09:26 question you know you
09:27 want to scientifically just start to
09:29 approach this and say okay well you know
09:34 as long as the body is engineered to
09:36 handle itself then big beings could be a
09:41 reality now the the instant thing that
09:46 pops up in my mind about this claim
09:48 although there is again if you look it
09:51 up online you'll find there's actually a
09:54 paleontologist or sorry goddamnit
09:56 there's an anthropologist who believes
09:57 in Bigfoot and he's the one that's
10:00 essentially tried to connect these two
10:02 together even though they're two totally
10:03 different species of being but he has
10:06 some logic to it but he's the one that's
10:08 actually scanned in these books from the
10:10 Smithsonian he's highlighted the you
10:12 know passages and he's showing it to the
10:14 audience and he's asking the audience
10:15 he's like you can read this right you
10:17 know here's the cover and he I think he
10:19 even passes one around the audience and
10:21 he goes look these are real and they're
10:23 old and this was documented so I am not
10:25 making this up this is this is like
10:29 mind-blowing right but now here's the
10:33 here's the sort of rub for the rest of
10:36 us again when you study dinosaurs okay
10:40 and you find out all the chicanery that
10:43 went around from the late 1850s all the
10:45 way to the end of the century of the
10:48 19th century and you start to realize
10:51 that again the two guys that's basically
10:54 launched paleontology were complete
10:55 [ __ ] frauds but everything today
10:57 looks like all of their simulated
11:00 skeletons they're making it up
11:02 they were completely faking it and we're
11:03 caught faking it right so they don't get
11:06 to be real just because you want them to
11:08 be real just because you mistakenly you
11:10 know got your heart wrapped around it
11:12 brontosaurus right the logic behind
11:16 dinosaurs not existing doesn't have to
11:19 go all the way to you know trying to
11:22 find the bones today and of course they
11:24 dig up [ __ ] all the time but then when
11:25 you study the digs and study the people
11:27 that dig them up they seem to know
11:29 exactly where they are before they dig
11:30 them up as if they're being placed
11:31 there's several companies in the world
11:34 big one in China big one in Canada that
11:37 advertise that they will come to your
11:38 location
11:39 just set them free on your land
11:41 and they will install a skeleton
11:44 wherever you want it they'll install it
11:46 into a mountainside those start on the
11:48 ground they'll do any type of species
11:51 that you want as big as your money can
11:53 afford they'll put a brontosaurus in the
11:54 [ __ ] ground
11:55 right and so no one can really trust the
11:58 digs but the number one reason why you
12:02 want to question dinosaurs ever existing
12:05 is because man has excavated gigantic
12:09 amounts of soil out of the ground and no
12:11 culture on earth has reported dinosaurs
12:15 existing or finding these things who
12:18 have dug tremendous amounts of soil out
12:20 of the ground we're today you can just
12:22 you know walk right back in those
12:23 locations where they dug the pyramids of
12:25 Egypt you can you can go to the pyramids
12:29 all throughout South America and they'll
12:31 just go there's a dinosaur there's a
12:33 dinosaur they're just everywhere right
12:35 they also tend to make them very
12:37 Hollywood locations right but man used
12:42 to save teeth right when man would kill
12:45 a beast they pulled the teeth out and
12:47 you know you go South America you got a
12:48 bunch of cannibalistic [ __ ] and same
12:50 thing in Africa we probably all were
12:52 cannibalistic at some point
12:53 unfortunately but imagine them finding a
12:56 giant skull a gigantic tooth a gigantic
12:59 skeleton of some sort they would have
13:01 dug the thing out of the ground they
13:03 would have had the king's throne made
13:04 out of some Triceratops skull they would
13:08 have but they didn't would you go to
13:11 Africa and everything that they kill
13:13 becomes part of their their God system
13:17 you know same thing with the Native
13:18 Americans no the Bison was a religious
13:21 entity when you kill one you had to use
13:24 every single piece of it otherwise you
13:26 were blasphemous to mother earth okay so
13:31 here's the thing the story goes is that
13:35 the Native Americans at minimum and our
13:38 region of the world this may have
13:39 occurred in other places please chime in
13:41 if you've heard in other locations I
13:42 have not heard it articulated in other
13:44 areas other than anthropologists will
13:47 say that cultures will have these
13:49 beliefs and giant humans that preceded
13:52 them right without any evidence of all
13:54 at all right
13:55 now again a skeleton only lasts so long
13:57 without very careful preservation it
14:00 just deteriorates right fossilization
14:03 well there are some people that don't
14:05 believe it actually occurs but I've seen
14:07 trilobite fossils in Kansas versus you
14:10 know forgot someone as a kid and so you
14:12 know the fossilization is that you have
14:14 a bone there so sort of hard body that's
14:18 organic as it decomposes in a very swamp
14:22 ridden sediment the way I have way have
14:27 it explained to me is that a a certain
14:30 portion of the organic matter dies and
14:32 you know atomizers or floats away or
14:34 what-have-you in stone and it's primal
14:37 form what goes into that location hold
14:39 still like a mud and there's each one of
14:41 the things bubbles out undisturbed by a
14:44 foot or a roaring river or anything like
14:46 that there's zero movement in this
14:48 process it swaps out just like the
14:51 Petrified Forest here in America that
14:54 [ __ ] exists I've been there okay
14:56 you have quartz trees man okay it does
15:00 exist right you silicon-based trees but
15:06 let's just say all these dudes from
15:08 Europe came and dug up a bunch of
15:10 skeletons well America is a huge place
15:14 at the time that these things were
15:15 supposedly being dug up out of the
15:17 ground and shipped back to I guess
15:19 Washington to be analyzed and then
15:22 shipped over to Europe to be lost they
15:25 don't have the ability to explore the
15:27 majority of America's soil just an
15:30 infinitesimal amount of railroad track
15:32 had been laid down even after they got
15:34 the whole Santa Fe Railroad to go
15:36 coast-to-coast there's still 98% 99% of
15:41 the United States which doesn't have a
15:42 railroad or a road so you would think
15:45 that just digging a hole for your your
15:48 basement in the Midwest or whatever
15:51 you're gonna bump into old graves of all
15:55 kinds of stuff right I mean it happens
15:58 you know Native American settlements are
16:00 bumped into all the time but we haven't
16:04 found a gigantic pit of these gigantic
16:07 of creatures hmm it would seem logical
16:11 that we would know again a body out
16:15 there in the woods for a couple hundred
16:17 years is going to be gone now
16:21 to make matters worse about this giant
16:23 human thing because some of you might be
16:25 yelling out dude there's all kinds of
16:27 pictures all over the internet of these
16:28 things mmm I think there's a [ __ ] ton of
16:32 photoshop out there right in this day
16:35 and age if you can see a color
16:37 photograph what is it being taken with
16:40 and some dude sitting there with 35
16:43 millimeter Nikon es or whatever cranking
16:47 over the film does he have like a
16:48 Polaroid camera a 110 camera at the
16:51 little flashbulb and the little slider
16:53 thing no they're being taken with
16:55 cellphones
16:56 if the event is occurring in the modern
16:58 age right and I don't give a [ __ ] where
17:00 you want Planet Earth it's a cell phone
17:02 taking that picture even if you have a
17:06 regular 35 millimeter simulated digital
17:10 camera it has a movie feature in it and
17:12 someone is going to take a movie of a
17:16 gigantic [ __ ] skull or you know a big
17:19 skeleton that's you know 25 feet long
17:22 they're gonna do it it's gonna be like
17:24 meeting a UFO all right and finding a
17:27 UFO right but that never happens so
17:30 anytime you see these photographs online
17:32 you just bear with me that they're
17:35 probably fake now if you see old
17:37 photographs in 1800s it's a little
17:40 little better but these are every claim
17:42 out there that's outrageous we have to
17:44 be very good about taking the photograph
17:45 into Photoshop blowing out the contrasts
17:49 looking for anti-aliasing algorithms
17:51 that someone has sewn something in that
17:54 wasn't there before because it is
17:56 extremely difficult to take a photo from
17:58 one source and paste it into another
18:01 source and keep all the gamma ratings
18:03 the same all the brightness levels the
18:05 same they're very very spectrum of
18:07 grayscale changes and so experts can
18:10 figure this stuff out now there are
18:12 methods of washing things out there's
18:14 usually a trace of some [ __ ] in there
18:16 and so be careful and those are
18:19 technical terms
18:21 now in terms of them being large I know
18:26 we have a wide range of community here
18:29 which I absolutely adore I love it
18:31 we have globe people and we have
18:33 flatterers people I highly respect both
18:35 camps I don't think either camp is
18:37 completely proving their point right
18:39 glow burs haven't created a video of
18:42 flying over the Antarctica nor I
18:44 continue a shot of leaving Earth's orbit
18:47 so as some choppy thing these photos of
18:50 Earth from space is hilarious I think
18:53 Daniel posted an awesome one in our LOC
18:55 Facebook group which was a shot of how
18:57 big Earth is when you're standing on the
18:59 moon fake shot from NASA and then this
19:02 other fake shot of the the shot of the
19:04 backside of the moon towards the earth
19:06 and it's like massive the earth is huge
19:09 and and you know the moon is like big as
19:12 well someone just did some math and they
19:14 didn't get the math right it's just so
19:15 bad so again and then you know Flat
19:20 Earth you got to do your stuff you got
19:24 to find that one conclusive thing that
19:26 every human being on earth can do you
19:27 know hold a glass of water like this and
19:29 then jump up and down and spin around
19:30 and then that thing happens we need it
19:33 that that intensely right but let's just
19:38 go with expanding earth my favorite
19:41 theory that is completely provable
19:43 mathematically the earth is being
19:45 injected with plasma energy from the Sun
19:48 it is what is in all celestial body guts
19:50 including moons and this causes the
19:54 outer crust which is the dry part that
19:56 we stand on to expand that's why all the
20:00 continents when you shrink all the
20:01 oceans they all connect on all sides no
20:03 Pangaea drift that's complete [ __ ]
20:05 by the way I learned that the Boston
20:07 school system I don't know if that's
20:09 true but it was a mainstream article has
20:12 switched to the Peters projection map
20:14 globe if that is the case when I went to
20:17 school in Boston that's where I passed
20:19 sixth grade and failed seventh grade I
20:21 feel the seventh grade like Andre the
20:25 Giant taking tattoo from Fantasy and
20:28 [ __ ] body slamming up against his
20:29 knee
20:30 that's about if it failed seven degrees
20:32 was horrible
20:33 but they're good I mean they are really
20:36 scientific in that in that state once
20:38 you hit seventh-grade boy
20:39 it is a rude awakening if you're not
20:42 paying attention I'm not sure I'd like
20:44 to do it like a forensics test as to why
20:46 I was so bad in the tests I couldn't
20:47 figure out what was on the tests my dad
20:49 helped me once because I start breaking
20:51 home like five FS right and he's like
20:56 you know what's wrong you're really
20:57 smart what's up like I don't know man I
20:59 can't figure out what's on the test and
21:00 so for a whole nine week period he would
21:04 drill me on everything especially in
21:07 biology and bio biology and seventh
21:10 grade was about four times more
21:12 complicated than my biology and in high
21:15 school that just puts it in perspective
21:18 dissecting a frog for a month versus
21:21 dissecting a frog for a day and
21:23 dissecting all kinds of stuff dog sharks
21:25 and pig heart or cow hearts and pig
21:28 eyeballs and also their [ __ ] high school
21:30 was one day but he helped me out and you
21:33 know the thing he didn't do was ask the
21:36 teacher what was gonna be on the test we
21:38 study I got aced half this test and then
21:40 there was like this other after the test
21:41 and I'm going where the [ __ ] did this
21:43 come from am I going through some growth
21:45 spurt of complete autism I can't figure
21:47 out what the teachers saying I came back
21:49 to Kansas we took a bunch of classes for
21:52 I took a took one class actually English
21:55 for my seventh grade and then just
21:57 started acing everything again I was
21:59 like what the hell I digress go to
22:02 expanding earth the science of expanding
22:06 earth is it the earth when all the
22:07 continents were together and oceans
22:09 weren't present in any major shape or
22:12 form which coincides with some research
22:14 the Germans did a German group of
22:16 scientists did this reverse engineering
22:19 the age of the ocean by reverse
22:21 engineering the amount of salt that's in
22:23 the ocean and just simply saying you no
22:25 matter dying in the ocean like fish
22:28 increases the salt levels plus their
22:30 waste products and all that kind of
22:31 stuff so when you reverse engineer they
22:32 said the oceans can't be more than 65
22:35 million years old now we know that we've
22:37 been utterly and completely lied to
22:39 about how long man has been on this
22:40 planet completely and utterly lied to
22:43 right they got this fake ice age thing
22:47 to create this barrier in your brain
22:49 that says what we definitely didn't live
22:51 past the Ice Age Ice Age ice is ice age
22:54 right now again there's equatorial you
22:58 know regions where the ice ages weren't
23:01 supposed to touch but still I think it's
23:03 yes ice probably gets a little bigger
23:06 every once in a while but this idea that
23:07 it encapsulates the world how the [ __ ]
23:10 is this happening right I mean they
23:12 think because big boulders rolled and
23:14 all this other crap they think it
23:15 happens any glaciers or glassy as they
23:18 exist they grow and they shrink they
23:20 move around but if the world was 1/4 the
23:23 size that is 1/4 the displacement of
23:26 etheral winds which means is 1/4 the
23:28 gravity that we have today
23:29 now again unlike the moon missions were
23:33 50-pound astronauts all of a sudden
23:37 become Clark Kent and [ __ ] float like
23:40 Superman you don't float on the moon ok
23:43 you don't your little kid doesn't float
23:45 because they weigh 30 pounds your dog
23:46 doesn't float because it's a chihuahua
23:48 it just weighs less I could drop an
23:51 envelope or this cigarette cigar and hit
23:53 the ground instantaneously right I mean
23:55 it would you know fall like Galileo was
23:57 the whole thing right ok
23:59 well these creatures may not have had
24:02 the crushing pressure on them right and
24:06 so a larger species of human being may
24:10 be possible you know the larger
24:14 dinosaurs if dinosaurs truly existed ok
24:17 this would explain their migratory
24:21 cycles from going from the warmer
24:23 regions and the wintertime to go into
24:27 the colder regions in the summer time
24:30 just like the Shoshone Indians did right
24:33 and Neal Adams has a really cool theory
24:35 that if dinosaurs did exist and they now
24:37 turn into largely either slithering you
24:40 know dragons
24:42 was it the Komodo dragon or whatever
24:44 little monitors or lizards or whatever
24:47 the ones that used to migrate because
24:50 they had to became Birds and because as
24:53 the continents pulled apart they got a
24:55 water barrier and it was just the one
24:57 that could kind of flap their little
24:59 wings and get across and eventually they
25:01 over millions of years figured how to
25:03 fly so they could continue to migrate
25:05 using you know the Van Allen belts
25:09 signal the electromagnetic signals of
25:12 Earth because there's a there's a
25:15 there's a pole going at the top and in
25:17 the bottom and bought the top and in the
25:18 bottom right and they just I guess they
25:20 fly against it and they fly with it on
25:22 particular time of year but big human
25:25 beings could potentially exist because
25:28 of the lack of gravity now they still
25:32 might weigh what we weight today but
25:34 they're just much bigger trying to get
25:36 to 180 pounds they might be twenty feet
25:38 right on a biological level you have to
25:41 keep in mind the fact that their hearts
25:43 have to pump fluid all over their bodies
25:46 the big debate as to whether or not I
25:48 think it was a brontosaurus in the first
25:50 scene of Jurassic Park would be capable
25:52 of standing up on its hind legs
25:54 I told Spielberg not to do it because it
25:57 doesn't have enough power to pump blood
26:00 through its entire body to the head
26:02 right with a lighter gravity system well
26:08 that could be possible so I'm in the
26:10 midst of recording last night
26:12 [Music]
26:15 unbeknownst to me even though I have
26:16 checked the weather I still when it's
26:19 supposed to rain it's completely blue
26:21 sky right now and not a single cloud in
26:22 the sky not a single plane dropping
26:24 clouds in the sky all of a sudden I
26:27 heard this brilliant ambient pitter
26:33 patter and I was like oh the hell's that
26:36 it really felt strange because I had so
26:39 not planned on it raining so I know I
26:43 was in the middle of the wrap-up about
26:46 giant humans and just to make sure I
26:51 don't repeat myself too badly you know
26:54 the big thing is they said they found a
26:57 bunch in the 1800s
26:59 but then they said well then we haven't
27:04 found any sentence really gotta take the
27:07 Photoshop images online with the big
27:09 grain of salt because there's no video
27:11 to back them up and every single device
27:12 that's taking photographs today has
27:14 camera on board I mean you're talking
27:17 about the iPhone coming out in 2007 and
27:21 we still had cameras on phones probably
27:24 three years before that so there's no
27:26 excuse why these recent claims of giant
27:30 skulls and you know you have these
27:32 archaeological digs these dudes hanging
27:34 out I'll put a few in there we should be
27:36 able to visit them but they don't exist
27:38 because it's all [ __ ] did I have a
27:40 kid it's you know in school when I was
27:42 young with double row teeth sure did do
27:45 we have gigantic human beings and might
27:47 be carrying this recessive gene we
27:49 definitely have giant human beings it's
27:52 coming from somewhere now you have to
27:53 know that some countries are
27:56 experimenting with the DNA of their
27:58 people I believe that I have read at
28:03 least a couple articles about growth
28:07 hormones being used in Asia to sort of
28:10 break this stereotype that they're short
28:12 people and you know I think naturally
28:15 speaking it's all [ __ ] anyway I mean
28:18 I suggest definitely regions of the
28:19 world where people are sure there's
28:20 white people in Europe that are short
28:24 they're always short but doesn't stop
28:27 them from being badasses and amazing
28:28 people so I think we need to not worry
28:32 about that so much
28:37 but the other part of this episode was
28:39 just simply to go after some things that
28:41 don't have tremendous I think things of
28:47 interest that have any substantive
28:48 evidence for them right and then whether
28:52 the other thing that's been haunting me
28:54 and just trying to create the episode
28:55 they're not haunting me in any negative
28:57 way is this area 51's for thing so I'll
29:02 make this episode about those two things
29:04 because I think we're going to top out a
29:06 little over an hour after I'm done here
29:07 you know we there's there's I don't know
29:11 a couple hundred hours worth of
29:13 documentaries that have aired on
29:15 television regarding area 51 but if you
29:19 watch them it's the same thing rehashed
29:22 and rehashed and rehashed at most you
29:26 have some night photography with
29:28 lights that kind of dance around right
29:31 Bob Lazar makes a bunch of claims of
29:34 being arrested with John Lear from the
29:37 Learjet company and his wife that he was
29:40 working there that was working in s4 so
29:43 let's just review real quickly area 51
29:48 was the area of land that was set aside
29:54 to do massive above-ground nuclear
29:56 testing
29:59 there are pock marks if you look on
30:01 Google Earth of north of the actual base
30:03 that's semi blocked on Google Maps you
30:07 know kind of goes through this word
30:09 phases again I don't think there's
30:10 anything going on at these locations
30:11 anymore because we've we've discovered
30:15 that they exist you know I mean I think
30:17 that things are happening but it's very
30:19 we'll get into the business model I
30:21 think what's going on there but I didn't
30:24 know until I did a big dive last year
30:27 that this was a big site for testing and
30:30 one thing you have to understand about
30:32 protecting this land is that the testing
30:36 you know caused a major surge in cancer
30:39 in this country you got fallout dropping
30:42 all over the place
30:43 soldiers just getting blasted by this
30:45 stuff so the the phenomenon of animals
30:52 like cattle getting mutilated where
30:55 their mouths and their butts have been
30:56 removed and they blamed it on great
30:57 aliens this is where you know people who
31:01 believe in those kind of things and a
31:04 very I would say effortless way they
31:09 don't need any evidence they just hear
31:11 it they're like oh yeah man UFOs man
31:13 come on you really think great aliens or
31:17 anybody coming in from outer space it's
31:19 like hell I wonder what's in the ass of
31:20 a cow in a mouth you know no this is the
31:25 government harvesting the soft tissue at
31:29 the mouth of a cow that has eaten grazed
31:33 food that has been radioactive for years
31:36 and then they want to see the
31:38 differential between the mouth and the
31:39 anus just figure out what is being
31:41 observed
31:42 and then they can do mathematics to
31:44 figure out what the average human being
31:45 might be consuming it's that simple but
31:50 area 51 gets eventually blocked off this
31:52 air force gates the air force base
31:54 excuse me he gets built and then we have
31:58 the testing of top-secret aircraft like
32:03 the u2 the sr-71 what was it the F 19 or
32:11 whatever was the one that testers did
32:12 you know the the stealth fighters the B
32:14 twos all this stuff now as I understand
32:17 it all that all of the designs come out
32:19 of various locations
32:21 obviously Lockheed Martin Boeing any one
32:26 of these Raytheon all these incredible
32:28 companies with all these skunkworks
32:31 organizations inside the
32:34 wright-patterson Air Force Base is sort
32:37 of the central hub for the evaluation of
32:40 those concepts wright-patterson does its
32:43 own research as I understand it right I
32:45 know I don't have any deep-rooted
32:48 sources in these areas whatsoever but
32:51 I've just seen a ton of videos where it
32:54 kind of got out of cuckoo land and every
32:56 time it seems to balance out that
32:59 ecosystem gets noted and it's very
33:02 consistent so why not right
33:06 we know that the materials from the
33:09 Roswell crash were routed through Fort
33:13 Worth Texas and then up to
33:15 wright-patterson Air Force Base there's
33:17 too many people that saw what happened
33:19 the one guy that traveled with the
33:20 debris to Texas watch to get loaded on a
33:23 plane that goes to wright-patterson Air
33:25 Force Base saying that none of it was
33:26 taken off the plane and yet these guys
33:28 are in there doing a press conference
33:30 about materials that came from this
33:32 crash okay Bob Lazar is the only human
33:39 being that I'm aware of that has ever
33:41 mentioned this other location as for
33:44 even when people have interviewed his
33:47 friends and confirmed that he worked at
33:49 area 51 which again the whole thing
33:51 could be such an easy PSYOP right that
33:54 they only only have it as a hearsay
33:58 rumor that s4 exists now s4 is supposed
34:00 to be south of area 51 you know I don't
34:05 know why Google Maps couldn't have that
34:06 figured out either I mean you know if
34:09 Google Maps Google Maps could have the
34:11 two different ways it could cut and
34:12 paste normal terrain on top of something
34:15 and then you wouldn't have any suspicion
34:16 that it's there this is just a wheat
34:18 field er that's just desert or it would
34:21 have a nice shrouded you know gouge on
34:23 but a square love saying that but any
34:29 time you approach area 51 what happens
34:31 you get the camo dudes on you and
34:33 there's tons of videos of this they are
34:35 on your ass like bugs on gas right now I
34:39 mentioned every once in a while for
34:40 those of you don't know I used to have a
34:41 radio show called MKULTRA radio and that
34:46 was from 2014 to 2015 we did about a
34:49 hundred and twenty five shows 100 proper
34:53 shows by hundred three proper shows and
34:54 then twenty five shows what we call real
34:57 or [ __ ] which has been lifted into
35:00 several shows on YouTube but one of the
35:04 coolest things we did journalistically
35:06 speaking is that we realized that we
35:08 knew people who owned the groom copper
35:13 mines in area 51 so there's a family
35:17 that owned all that land and the
35:19 government pushed in of course and
35:21 eminent domain the land and so right
35:25 away they lost you know a gigantic
35:27 portion but there is a copper mine I
35:30 think it's to the east artists of the
35:33 West there's a copper mine there tons of
35:35 copper still there when the family was
35:38 like look we don't mind leaving just
35:40 compensate us for the land including the
35:43 copper that's in the ground that
35:45 obviously you can excavate and make you
35:48 know billions off of and so the
35:51 government again this is back in the day
35:53 when you know they were complete [ __ ]
35:56 balls
35:56 they said no [ __ ] you we're not giving
36:00 any money get the [ __ ] off the win they
36:03 this is for me getting first-hand
36:06 testimony from these individuals
36:08 some of the second-degree but this is
36:12 from family members of the family they
36:16 said that and one person who was there
36:20 they said that they would wake up and
36:22 there were black black ops dudes in the
36:26 room in their house completely filled up
36:27 every room poking him in the chest with
36:30 guns and trying to [ __ ] scare them
36:32 putting pistols and their kids faces be
36:35 talking children under under seven or
36:38 eight this is your old government right
36:40 now already the land has been seized in
36:42 a way that they didn't get true payment
36:45 for what might be in the mineral rights
36:47 of those land the land area but when
36:49 they realized they weren't in a move the
36:52 government put a bunch of commandos into
36:56 the mine and blew the [ __ ] out of it so
36:59 that it couldn't be used basically
37:01 saying that you know look you're never
37:03 gonna be able to drill now because I
37:04 don't know you know
37:06 and so they destroyed the ability to
37:09 easily recapture or continue capturing
37:12 the copper in there and eventually
37:14 during Obama's administration big
37:18 [ __ ] surprise the whole place was
37:20 lifted off of them for like I don't know
37:23 it was in the single millions
37:26 single-digit millions at a low
37:28 single-digit millions when the the most
37:31 egregious si doubt that well the most
37:35 egregious estimate was in the twenty to
37:38 thirty million range but only because
37:40 the copper mine had been destroyed the
37:41 copper mine not been destroyed you'd be
37:43 dealing with hundreds of millions if not
37:47 higher so it is unfortunate that this
37:51 place is so enforced by complete
37:55 [ __ ] I mean our government has more
37:57 money than [ __ ] God and they can't
37:58 compensate this family properly it's not
38:00 like they're gonna turn into the Sultan
38:01 of Brunei's and run away and you know
38:04 invade America from some other foreign
38:06 country like why not just keep the press
38:09 completely unaware of what's going on
38:11 make a really good deal and then be done
38:15 with it have you area 51 don't be
38:17 [ __ ] right but you know I don't know
38:20 I mean it you know
38:21 most makes me feel like and this is just
38:23 a character chair of the situation that
38:26 you know your your Stanley Kubrick sort
38:30 of dr. Strangelove generals that are all
38:33 just gung-ho and they're just little
38:34 kids have been playing with Tonka cars
38:36 their whole [ __ ] like they never grew
38:37 up that's where you get the total pricks
38:39 or you get these executive guys that
38:42 just go huh [ __ ] it man we'll just take
38:43 it you know and it's that kind of
38:44 [ __ ] running the show but just know
38:49 that the family that owned that place
38:50 owned the land got completely royally
38:53 screwed and the cherry on top happened
38:55 during the Obama administration the
38:57 family was actually gagged from saying
39:01 anything and I guess to finish my point
39:02 we had em kill two radio boomin you know
39:05 is airing on kxr Z radio in LA and we
39:12 got to break the story first we actually
39:14 broke the story first as to what was
39:16 going on because we got a notice about
39:18 seven days before the gag was gonna be
39:20 lift and so we just popped that [ __ ]
39:23 knocked anyone cares nothing was paying
39:25 attention this poor family but s4
39:28 according to Bob Lazar is the location
39:30 in which there are at least nine crashed
39:35 UFOs of all different designs most of
39:37 them having suffered some external
39:41 damage of course if they had the Roswell
39:44 saucer there then that's blown out from
39:46 the inside so who knows right there's
39:50 not a lot of confirmation from anyone
39:52 but then what is the Alou or very 51 the
39:56 idea is it's a location that you could
39:58 go stand up on a really high summit
40:01 which they've locked all this [ __ ] off
40:02 nowadays and you can see sort of the
40:04 third act of Close Encounters of the
40:07 Third Kind you know the mothership comes
40:09 down the little tiny Scouts come down
40:11 and then you can see a light show now
40:15 it's most likely occurring if you look
40:17 at a Los Alamos labs and a few other
40:21 places that have been videotaped you
40:23 start realizing their propulsion systems
40:25 that they have they do have these little
40:28 teeny tiny robots with all kinds of
40:30 temporary very quick burning fuel
40:33 systems where are these
40:35 they're sort of like drones but they're
40:37 more rocket based more fuel based and
40:41 boy they can move around a room
40:43 SuperDuper fast right
40:45 my last startup that I had for a year
40:48 and a half we actually ended up renting
40:51 a space in the warehouse where the
40:53 oculus rift was it was invented
40:55 supposedly but they say and this was the
40:58 location where the the and this is not
41:03 classified or anything but you know the
41:04 little tiny drones that are you know
41:06 about the size of a deck of cards or
41:08 smaller they were studying swarm flying
41:12 technology so you'd have about you know
41:14 you'd have a grid of these things you
41:16 could have a three-dimensional cube of
41:17 these things or just a you know a little
41:20 fleet of them in a in a two-dimensional
41:22 square and they would fly at you and fly
41:25 around you and so that technology is
41:29 being developed as well so part of its
41:31 just simply having an area in the world
41:35 where you protect the space above -
41:37 right so you put all your own geocentric
41:39 orbit satellites just directly above
41:42 plus you fly plenty of military patrols
41:46 up there and so no foreign government
41:48 can look at your area now it's a very
41:54 tall order because you can also look
41:56 sideways can't you right so for instance
42:00 if China were to put up a or Russia were
42:04 to put up a geocentric orbit satellite
42:05 over Los Angeles with the right optics
42:08 and the right time of day it is my
42:10 belief that could clearly look over at
42:12 area 51 at various times a day but if
42:16 you fly at night then you have even
42:18 further issues with trying to capture
42:23 what's going on there right but what
42:25 could be the maximum use of that
42:29 facility okay so at some point
42:33 manufacturing is occurring whether or
42:35 not they have manufacturing facility
42:36 there's at night or not it doesn't
42:40 appear that there's any type of
42:41 manufacturing which means whatever is
42:43 there has to be either dragged there on
42:45 the ground or transported through the
42:49 air
42:49 by maybe even flying the vehicle
42:51 directly there now do we have top-secret
42:54 planes out there I think unquestionably
42:57 we do the one that's you know
43:00 romantically captured on camera all over
43:04 the Internet and again it's sometimes
43:06 they're decent you know footage
43:08 sometimes it's completely fake which is
43:10 the flying triangle which is I think
43:13 typically referred to as Project Aurora
43:16 you know the sr-71 supposedly started
43:19 flying in the early 60s the specs of its
43:23 in 1989 when they actually revealed it
43:25 to the world were largely improved from
43:28 63 so it's not like what it was able to
43:30 do and 89 was happening in 63 but
43:34 obviously if anyone had seen that
43:37 vehicle just land out of thin air in
43:41 1965 at some local airport I think that
43:45 at least 50% of the people watching that
43:48 thing land if they didn't see human
43:49 being in the cockpit would assume that
43:51 that was some sort of UFO because it was
43:55 like nothing else is black and all the
43:58 stealth technology in it - although
43:59 generation 1.0 so you know flying a
44:04 triangle using very very different
44:07 propulsion systems would definitely make
44:10 any one of us feel like it's a UFO just
44:12 immediately it doesn't look like
44:13 anything that we know but the
44:17 interesting thing is if you ever seen
44:18 the movie battle Los Angeles I used to
44:21 think it was called battle for Los
44:22 Angeles
44:23 maybe that was a Mendell effect the
44:26 special effects team and the writers did
44:28 a brilliant job making a fleet of UFOs
44:31 that ran off of hydrogen that was being
44:33 sucked out of the ocean so I was just
44:34 using hydrogen out of the water and then
44:36 converting that and flying around so the
44:39 propulsion systems made complete sense
44:40 on earth it wasn't like an antigravity
44:42 system it was actually you know burping
44:46 this propulsion underneath which I
44:50 thought was just utterly brilliant that
44:52 movie for having some corny actors here
44:55 in there I think the lead guy whose name
44:57 escapes me just did a brilliant job I
45:00 actually bought that movie
45:01 I know by movies that often these modern
45:04 ones anyway
45:05 and let's let's dovetail into a recap of
45:08 where we might be with an alien invasion
45:12 storyline because this one is something
45:14 I always just kind of keep my ears
45:16 perked out and I the comments are pretty
45:18 regular
45:19 throughout throughout a month I'll get
45:20 at least one person that mentions this
45:23 idea that the military will try to
45:26 create a globalist one-world government
45:27 from the threat of you know alien
45:31 invasion you know what would be the base
45:35 cuz I heard it a whole episode on this
45:36 so if you if you dig that that whole
45:38 idea definitely go see that episode
45:41 just look up alien invasion on the
45:43 channel so there's this rumor from John
45:46 Lear especially there's a bit of a
45:48 cuckoo I'd love to think he's not a
45:50 cuckoo but he's the kind of guy that oh
45:52 yeah I went to the moon no problem and
45:54 we see bases on the moon also the [ __ ]
45:56 okay dude show me and he's pointing it
45:59 like [ __ ] bumps on the moon going see
46:01 that that's obviously if I can you know
46:03 military-industrial complex on the dark
46:05 side the moon you're going dude there's
46:08 nothing that looks like anything right
46:09 you take a picture of [ __ ] Earth it
46:12 looks like intelligent beings created a
46:13 bunch of buildings and roads right but
46:16 anyway the idea that the military twenty
46:21 years ago at least has mastered
46:27 Holograms that are completely
46:29 indistinguishable from reality has been
46:31 claimed several times John layer talked
46:33 about a situation where he was invited
46:35 to a military briefing a little bit hard
46:38 to believe especially he was up there
46:39 running his mouth and he said the colon
46:41 Powell walked onto the stage I think it
46:44 was colon Powell maybe that was the
46:45 voice one but some guy walked on the
46:47 stage like completely photo-real said he
46:48 was going to show them some technology
46:52 instead of walking off stage the
46:54 character just disappeared and everybody
46:57 went whoa wait a minute what the hell
46:58 they were like that's our new technology
47:00 it's a new holographic technology now
47:04 having worked in fine pitch LEDs fine
47:10 pitch direct LED technology and being a
47:11 3d specialist in that technology
47:14 meaning that's what I did I made that
47:15 [ __ ] 3d and a two-dimensional plane and
47:21 then studying the whole you know a Tupac
47:24 and do and Michael Jackson false
47:28 Pepper's Ghost Holograms to show up at
47:30 these concerts it's not a hologram folks
47:33 its Pepper's Ghost it's it's projecting
47:36 it on glass only 45% of the theater can
47:38 see it maybe they've improved it a
47:40 little bit but they can never charge a
47:42 ticket for that attraction specifically
47:44 because half the audience or more can't
47:47 see the effect
47:48 Japan's been doing these amazing
47:49 concerts with their animated characters
47:52 doing the same thing for years but a
47:55 true hologram means that everyone can
47:58 see it in the room you can see it from
47:59 your pride proprietary angle right so if
48:03 I'm over on the right I see the left
48:05 side of the beam someone on the left
48:06 it's gonna see the right side of the
48:07 beam and it's opaque meaning no light
48:10 can go through it so they're not
48:11 transparent like a ghost and the only
48:14 technology I have ever heard rumored to
48:17 exist is a system by which lasers burn
48:20 air and what it is is there's a laser
48:23 that shoots in one vector and another
48:27 one shoots in another and where they
48:28 cross over the stimulation of the air
48:32 becomes essentially toxic to the air and
48:35 burns it at that point you have a tiny
48:38 cloud of air that is white and then a
48:42 third projection laser puts in RGB color
48:45 on that little dot and if you could do
48:48 that a high enough resolution at a fast
48:50 enough frame rate which for the human
48:52 eye would need to be probably around
48:55 we're not quite sure but it's like
48:58 between 80 and 120 frames per second per
49:00 eye which in this case is gonna go into
49:04 both eyes both times at all times I
49:07 should say then you're gonna get a
49:08 pretty decent hologram right there are
49:11 theories that the people who say they
49:13 saw planes in New York although if you
49:16 rewind all that footage it's a
49:17 completely different story if you listen
49:18 to eyewitnesses eyewitnesses who watched
49:21 the first plane at the World Trade
49:22 Center claimed it was a tiny plane a
49:25 small plane not a big plane but they did
49:27 say a plane
49:28 he flew directly into the World Trade
49:29 Center now that plane would not have
49:31 penetrated the outer crust neither would
49:34 a big giant 757 most of it would have
49:37 been either hanging out of the building
49:39 or falling down on the face we didn't
49:41 see any that right
49:43 but there's claims that you know 9/11
49:45 use the technology to stealth a missile
49:49 I don't think anything was necessarily
49:51 there yet everyone I've ever talked to
49:53 is yet to tell me they saw it with their
49:57 own two eyes and when you ask them you
50:00 know and you really interview them where
50:01 were you where were you I was in the
50:03 restaurant down below watching on TV I
50:05 heard it but I didn't see it you've got
50:08 two things that have to happen for this
50:10 alien invasion thing right you have to
50:11 have things that you see in the sky if
50:16 they want to be complete crazy with this
50:18 thing they would attack the ground like
50:21 literally lasers or something you know
50:22 shooting buildings which you can
50:24 reintroduce your weapons of natural
50:26 destruction and I forgot to mention the
50:30 weapons of natural destruction episode
50:31 that the hurricane benefits our global
50:35 warming right so people are going for
50:37 global warming and climate change I just
50:39 read an article the day after I recorded
50:41 the episode saying oh hurricanes are
50:43 getting bigger and bigger these days and
50:45 that's proof the global warming is
50:46 happening you know they call it climate
50:48 change to get away from the reality of
50:50 their original line of horseshit
50:54 but like man the world's like it in in
50:56 12 years thank you Cortes get back in
51:00 the small bus now at some point in this
51:04 alien invasion thing you're gonna have
51:06 to introduce in my opinion some craft
51:09 that are so gigantic that you sort of
51:11 have an Independence Day moment and
51:13 that's going to require technology that
51:16 we have absolutely no knowledge of at
51:18 all we can speculate they might have
51:20 some anti-gravity system but imagine the
51:22 energy required to move a gigantic
51:26 football-field-sized object in the sky
51:28 or three or four times bigger or maybe a
51:31 mile long you hear these reports in the
51:34 Midwest that you know vehicles in the
51:36 dark with very minimal light have moved
51:39 you know everyone over
51:41 particular community and there's some
51:43 claims of footage of it and they're like
51:46 man this thing covered my whole town and
51:47 my town is a a Township you know it's
51:51 like a six mile square thing so it had
51:54 to be gigantic all right you know far be
51:58 it for me to tell them that they're not
51:59 seeing that but at some point during a
52:02 Lee invasion I think you also need to
52:03 come up with a landing procedure and
52:06 you're going to have to produce highly
52:09 intelligent beings that actually leave
52:11 the craft and they're going to have to
52:14 be a typical of any human being in a
52:17 suit and so you're going to have to
52:20 create sort of hybrid humans really
52:23 bizarre creatures which is what bob
52:26 lazar supposedly speculated to his buddy
52:30 John Lear so what's cool about Bob at
52:34 least even if he's a hoaxster because he
52:37 hasn't gone too far off the deep end
52:38 he's been very careful about what he's
52:40 talked about in terms of propulsion
52:42 systems he just basically says there's
52:44 an element that they have discovered in
52:46 alien spacecraft and when putting
52:48 electricity through it it warped space
52:49 and when it warped space it gives
52:52 propulsion but the other time he's
52:54 talking about antimatter engines that
52:56 hang down below that when pointed
52:58 integer it's a particular direction they
53:00 converged their waves of energy and that
53:03 creates the warping space so he's got to
53:05 get his story straight about you know
53:07 which one of these systems he's going to
53:09 marry himself to but if the if they were
53:11 really really smart and if I were
53:15 running the program let's just put that
53:16 way I would say okay we're gonna make
53:18 this a I don't know 20-year invasion
53:22 program in terms of program is something
53:25 on paper that we're actually executing
53:27 right and for the first you know five
53:32 years it's just going to be things seen
53:35 over major cities and it should be one
53:39 of a peaceful nature but have a little
53:41 bit of ambiguity to potentially freak
53:44 out all the religious people of the
53:45 world such that they are clamoring to
53:48 join the deep state in order to be
53:50 protected the religious implosion on
53:53 this planet would be
53:56 a thing a sight to see
53:58 wouldn't it they've actually they've
54:01 actually got the Pope's that keep going
54:03 through the Catholic pedophilia
54:04 institution to now soften their their
54:09 stance on life from other planets and
54:12 they've said now okay yeah probably does
54:14 exist probably life does exist out there
54:16 for those of you think that low birth is
54:19 a conspiracy to get rid of God that
54:22 would be part of that plan right but you
54:25 know you just put lights in the sky that
54:27 move very intelligently you do it in
54:29 such a way that maybe it is the hologram
54:31 technology because the hologram
54:33 technology would work in the dark as
54:35 well as the light as a matter of fact
54:36 because it would be the byproduct of
54:39 well but this way if it were the
54:41 byproduct of that burning air technique
54:43 which that that invention does exist
54:47 then it would be it would just be a
54:51 Christmas tree in the sky and it would
54:53 be a typical of a vehicle that would
54:56 probably normally be created because
54:58 we'd have to say oh the whole
54:59 exoskeleton of the UFO is lit because of
55:02 the energy system blah blah blah which
55:03 is why you see all sides of the thing in
55:06 the middle of the night whereas in
55:09 reality it would have dark spots if it
55:10 wasn't lit in light spots if it had a
55:12 light on it right I will say that I have
55:14 definitely seen these brilliant kind of
55:20 UFO there they're floating UFOs that
55:24 humans have made and it's really
55:26 brilliant I mean they've done like
55:28 inflatable things that look like UFOs
55:30 don't think even landed in the Superbowl
55:32 at one point or something but they look
55:35 very convincing if you don't know it's a
55:37 hoax right especially if it was being
55:40 filmed and you couldn't hear the
55:41 propellers that are actually making the
55:44 vehicle fly right but in terms of you
55:48 know a ship landing and creatures coming
55:51 out you then you'd have to go look and
55:52 see if you know the military's been
55:54 hydrating a bunch of humans with other
55:56 species on this planet to create
55:58 bizarre-looking you know almond eye
56:00 creatures and therefore you know can you
56:03 talk to can you raise them and give them
56:04 intelligence can you raise them and make
56:06 them think that they're aliens
56:08 and so they come out and they speak a
56:10 weird language that you've taught them
56:12 that you've created and it didn't have a
56:16 negotiation with them right they land on
56:18 the White House lawn and get out and go
56:21 in and talk to whoever's president at
56:22 the time but that would be extremely
56:26 powerful optics for the world right but
56:30 your huge problem with the whole thing
56:32 is that they wouldn't be just landing
56:35 like like with the Day the Earth Stood
56:37 Still right they only land in America
56:39 and a baseball field in Washington yeah
56:42 they'd land at the Kremlin they land in
56:45 Shanghai they laying all over the place
56:48 and if it's America creating this
56:52 conspiracy you'd have to get all the
56:55 other countries to go along with you and
56:57 I don't think that these countries want
56:59 to take a risk that another country has
57:01 developed all the technology for the
57:03 platform with assurances that nothing
57:05 will go wrong because if this went wrong
57:08 then every country would realize that
57:11 their that their country is a bunch of
57:13 [ __ ] liars and so I don't think that
57:16 it's going to be something we'll see in
57:18 our lifetime I don't think they're gonna
57:19 pull that trick so when I used to rap up
57:23 when I went into area 51 and researched
57:25 everything it was really a bore fest of
57:28 bore fests right the only thing that's
57:30 exciting about those regions are the
57:32 rumors created by people you say they've
57:34 either worked there or have observed
57:36 something but I don't think I've seen
57:38 anything on tape you know recorded I
57:41 should say that speaks could the calls
57:45 out to an unquestionable alien
57:47 technology even if the things that these
57:49 craft are doing superfast maneuvers hey
57:53 man we've got some pretty badass
57:54 technology we need to assume that that
57:57 illusion can be created by normal man
58:01 again it's just a lightens in darkness
58:03 flying around really quickly what if
58:05 they had a little machine that created
58:07 ball lightning and they know that as
58:08 soon as ball lightning exists a big
58:11 plasma ball or a small plasma ball it's
58:13 gonna be bright as the Sun right and
58:15 they know once they burp this thing out
58:17 of the machine it hits the atmosphere
58:18 and goes four thousand miles an hour I
58:20 wonder
58:21 action well you can just turn that
58:22 little gimmick on any time you want and
58:24 it's not really a UFO it's just
58:26 something that's really shocking to the
58:28 mind only because you impose on it that
58:31 is actually a man-made vehicle and not
58:33 just a national phenomenon
58:34 of the universe right and again don't
58:38 forget that a plasma ball would utterly
58:40 and completely reflect all radar off of
58:44 its surface because nothing can
58:45 penetrate a ball lightning I guarantee
58:47 it that's why there's silver that's why
58:50 they're chroma SH if they spin fast
58:52 enough they turn into a disc and so all
58:55 of that is just incidental to our
59:00 existence
59:00 so hopefully this episode had a little
59:03 variety for you guys and didn't OD too
59:06 much on one thing I've got a pretty big
59:09 list of these topics that I'll probably
59:11 start covering in a 50/50 split
59:14 hopefully the the weather predictions
59:17 will be a little more accurate so I
59:19 don't have to jump off in the middle of
59:21 the episode that was pretty damn
59:22 hilarious I take provisions for rain
59:25 every episode maybe not today because
59:28 it's completely blue up there so I have
59:30 towels that I quickly throw on all my
59:32 equipment and drag it inside I was only
59:34 halfway through my cigar what a bummer
59:36 so anyway if you haven't been to deep
59:38 thoughts radio.com
59:39 please go there is audio and video in
59:42 case you want to change feeds there's a
59:43 lock Facebook group patreon page and a
59:45 Twitter account so get up there if you
59:48 want to jump on the social media and
59:49 start participating in the conversation
59:50 it's it's huge I can't tell you I mean
59:53 if people just started combing through
59:55 out the comments on all the videos I
59:57 think you would find a lot of extremely
59:59 enlightening perspectives resources
60:02 books that are being referenced and
60:04 unfortunately the one thing I just don't
60:08 have time to really jump into is if
60:09 someone says oh have you read this book
60:11 and you know your narrator schedule is
60:16 as packed as life can be packed so it's
60:19 it's almost impossible for me to pull
60:22 aside a book and read it so at most I go
60:24 get the Cliff's Notes from it and try to
60:26 incorporate it into episodes but most
60:28 the time I can't even get a holy s--t
60:29 books so I'd be broke if I tried to buy
60:31 every book that everyone recommended to
60:33 me
60:34 so unfortunately if you have a reference
60:37 and it's in video or audio form I can
60:40 put that in the background while I'm
60:41 doing something else and then I get the
60:43 information that your you're wanting to
60:45 send to me
60:46 so anyway take care of yourself with
60:48 someone else and I'll see you in the
60:49 next deep thoughts over now
60:51 [Music]
61:00 you
