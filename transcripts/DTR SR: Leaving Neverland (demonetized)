00:00 [Music]
00:32 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:34 deep thoughts today I thought I would do
00:38 a special report there's also been a
00:40 request for it on the Facebook page
00:43 we're gonna do a special report on this
00:45 Michael Jackson documentary on HBO
00:52 it's called leaving Neverland and it's a
00:57 two-parter it's four hours long then you
01:01 put a disclaimer up here if you want to
01:03 see this show and you haven't seen it
01:04 you don't want to hear any spoilers push
01:08 pause change to a different video come
01:11 back when you're done so this one is a
01:14 very interesting situation because we
01:16 have a legacy and that's a double
01:21 entendre we've got Michael Jackson who's
01:24 a legacy and then we have our own path
01:27 with this particular situation I got a
01:33 racoon back there or somewhere so I
01:37 think out of the three hundred and
01:40 seventy plus videos that I've done up to
01:42 this point I think at some point I
01:44 defended him in one of my videos and you
01:51 know for those of you who are listening
01:52 on and you don't have HBO you're not
01:55 gonna see it but you're just interested
01:57 in listening to this maybe you want to
01:58 get a little set up in a preview the
02:00 whole thing this show is about two
02:03 gentlemen who were very young kids who
02:08 impressed Michael Jackson Michael
02:11 Jackson took them into his camp so to
02:16 speak and gave them the world that he
02:19 had but then when it came time for
02:24 nighttime he figured out a way to get
02:29 the kid isolated from the parents
02:31 according to these two gentlemen I
02:33 should say according these two guys got
02:36 them away from their parents and the
02:38 parents are also confirming this in for
02:40 me
02:40 we're gonna talk about those of you who
02:42 think this is still an attack nobody
02:47 wants to believe this let's get that out
02:48 of the way right away nobody wants to
02:51 believe Michael Jackson was a pedophile
02:56 but it starts off with two different
02:59 guys telling two different stories they
03:01 are never in the same room together
03:03 it does seem like maybe they've met I
03:06 don't know
03:10 but definitely the same documentary
03:13 they're grown men now they're extremely
03:16 successful people at least I would say
03:19 the minimum level of success is
03:21 successful one of them is extremely
03:24 successful and he really did it himself
03:29 he and his parents did themselves and
03:31 obviously the buzz around the kid that
03:36 he was Michael Jackson's friend
03:38 obviously opened up massive doors I
03:40 don't know that the documentary really
03:42 went into the exact doors that Michael
03:44 opened by making phone calls at night
03:50 when at the ranch that never never the
03:54 Neverland Ranch and in countless hotels
03:57 and and when I say there's something
04:00 that happens at the ranch according to
04:02 this well according to those that went
04:06 there are hundreds of rooms and it's a
04:09 little bit of an exaggeration but there
04:11 are hundreds of rooms on that property
04:13 it's 2,700 acres with all kinds of
04:14 different properties but you're probably
04:17 talking about easily a dozen locations
04:20 maybe two dozen locations where this
04:24 stuff would occur it was almost as if if
04:27 a room had ten houses and they were by
04:30 themselves for a week they would make it
04:32 a point to go into every single room
04:34 just to check it off the list like
04:35 little kids but let's pull back before
04:40 we get into the details I mean I'm not
04:41 gonna get in any of the explicit details
04:43 you can watch the show for that stuff
04:46 I'm finding my own emotions to be
04:50 extremely unique about the subject
04:52 matter because you know I bust people
04:53 balls all the time on the show you know
04:56 Joe Biden touching little girls in the
04:59 White House oh my god when a [ __ ]
05:01 creep that guy is right but honestly Joe
05:07 on the videos has never accomplished
05:10 anything that Michael has been accused
05:12 of perhaps he has some outside source
05:13 where he gains his hubris that he is
05:16 untouchable one would assume you check
05:20 his passport for a Lolita Island visits
05:23 but maybe that's just as far as that guy
05:25 takes it he's just a creeper it seems
05:29 hard to believe right you go that far
05:31 but you don't go the whole way what you
05:33 do it all the time every time and you do
05:35 it in front of their parents you do it
05:36 in front of people to point Jeff
05:37 Sessions swatched your hand because
05:40 you're doing it too much but anyway
05:43 let's go back to Michael Michaels case
05:46 is so utterly unique I'm not sure we
05:50 have another Michael situation now for
05:54 those of you who never liked Michael he
05:56 was in your generation you're too young
05:58 this might be a little difficult to
06:00 understand I don't know who to name in
06:05 the modern era you do realize if
06:08 someone's born in the year 2000 they're
06:10 19 years old this year oh wow yeah some
06:14 of us are old but all of us who loved
06:18 Michael loved the music that he put
06:22 together we realize Michael Jackson was
06:24 a was a complete package this kid was
06:26 phenomenal as a child so you have the
06:28 first ten years of his fame is something
06:31 to just marvel at a little tiny kid
06:34 doing James Brown moves and singing
06:36 adult quality emotions within a song
06:41 then you have him doing his album off
06:45 the wall where he splits up from his
06:46 brothers and goes solo my god there are
06:50 songs in that album that will never
06:52 cease to be musical magic and of course
06:56 there's Michael's contribution there's
06:58 Quincy Jones contribution and all the
07:00 players that contributed to all the
07:02 songs
07:03 but what's wild about Michael and you
07:06 know when you get into the music into
07:07 you find out that there are bands that
07:09 write their own stuff and then you find
07:13 out their project bands that write none
07:15 of their stuff you know but Donna's
07:18 never written anything of her own at
07:22 least not her formative albums her good
07:25 albums it's all purchased from people
07:27 all right it's entertainment okay
07:30 all right Elvis never Whitney his songs
07:31 either Elton John never wrote any of his
07:34 lyrics but he wrote all the music so hey
07:36 if it's fun we all work together and
07:38 collaborate no problem
07:40 it is super impressive when a prince
07:42 comes along and he does everything plays
07:44 all his own instruments sings all of his
07:46 own and writes his lyrics sings them all
07:48 and in these and keys that no one
07:50 [ __ ] plays in and he's just
07:52 tremendously unique it's amazing
07:54 then Michael just Thriller and that's
07:58 when a I don't know an aftershock wave
08:03 enveloped the world with this guy you
08:07 know every way to world record because
08:08 of every single song hit the top ten
08:12 incredible he lives the entire 80s
08:16 almost inside the thriller envelope and
08:20 then he comes out with I'm bad which was
08:25 kind of interesting because in thriller
08:27 all those songs match Michaels
08:29 personality by the time he gets to I'm
08:31 bad we're all going yeah you are bad I
08:34 mean not bad me any bad but bad meaning
08:36 good like Run DMC said but he's not
08:39 exactly the big alpha male that he was
08:42 trying to play in this stuff and you
08:43 know sort of was like Michael you don't
08:45 have to do that you can just be this
08:47 cool person with the higher wesley
08:49 snipes to stand next to you to make you
08:50 macho you know but again another big
08:54 album tremendous number of like
08:56 blockbuster songs and the guy was just
08:59 untouchable I think about his music is
09:03 that every single song has just this
09:06 feeling of magic and the Jackson 5 added
09:08 to it was as if this group of humans
09:12 were ordained by the music gods to to
09:16 whenever they wanted to make music the
09:18 most heavenly melodies came down
09:20 whatever this guy was trying to
09:22 accomplish was always accomplished even
09:24 the scream album or the scream single
09:29 was had it's phenomenal qualities to it
09:33 it appears as if Michael had his stage
09:36 where or should say years make it easier
09:40 to understand where he was engaging this
09:43 a maybe was forming his methodology and
09:46 then it goes all the way to probably the
09:50 2000s probably about 2005 or so where he
09:57 is finally pulling out of this sort of
09:59 danger zone but we're all sitting here
10:04 going oh my god
10:07 we've been defending this guy because we
10:09 love him we love what he does he brings
10:11 us happiness he brings us emotions the
10:13 music that he sing he's in the way that
10:14 it's written the way it is played the
10:16 lyrics if you get into lyrics it makes
10:18 you feel wonderful it makes you feel
10:19 like the world has some hope but
10:23 underneath is a really broken dude with
10:26 Michael there's this there's this weird
10:29 caveat to the guy what happens when we
10:34 hear about pedophiles a priest of all
10:37 things touching children well there's a
10:41 distinct difference at least on the
10:44 surface that we think we're seeing which
10:46 is that Michaels entire childhood was
10:49 non-existent you realize we saw him
10:53 perform at five years old with his
10:55 brothers and he had the James Brown
10:57 moves down he's saying amazing he was
11:00 just on target so five years old well
11:05 what do you think happened did he think
11:06 he was living a normal life until five
11:08 and one day goes hey brothers I've been
11:11 listening James Brown mind if I sing no
11:13 the job was on those kids the second
11:16 that they could walk it's a very similar
11:19 behavior like Tiger Woods dad did it
11:21 Mozart's dad did it these parents that
11:24 push their kids into talents and they
11:26 kind of hate their parents for it
11:28 they don't necessarily have the same
11:29 exact emotion we have because it's a job
11:34 it turned out that Michael ended up
11:35 loving being on stage you said it
11:37 several times you could just live on
11:38 stage if he could he'd be the happiest
11:41 dude on planet earth one because he'd
11:42 never be alone now why the guy ever
11:45 stopped touring I don't know if that was
11:47 his opinion when we think about a priest
11:50 a Joe Biden and we were talking about
11:53 people that grew up you know although
11:56 they may have been abused or whatever
11:57 they still had a chance to get out of
12:00 this because they had a normal maturity
12:04 maturation thing happened and then they
12:09 chose to go there now some people might
12:14 think that that's all [ __ ] that it's
12:16 just a cover story for a guy wants to be
12:19 a perv well I don't know how long you
12:22 could pretend being a kid and spend 24
12:24 hours a day running around with little
12:25 kids pretending to be kids just so you
12:27 could do something with them later
12:28 that's inappropriate I don't have that
12:31 in me I know about you Jesus just even
12:34 if I had noble intentions at all running
12:36 around all [ __ ] day 365 days out of
12:39 the year spinning you know thousands of
12:43 hours on the phone with each one of
12:45 these kids but now here's where I'm
12:48 trying to check my own brain am i
12:52 pulling punches with Michael Jackson
12:53 am I not willing to criticize him as as
12:57 much as I would criticize others I'm
13:00 still analyzing I just finished it I
13:01 mean it's taking me about three days to
13:03 get through the the four hours of the
13:06 show because my life is busy and I'm
13:08 just like okay I'll watch like half an
13:09 hour here an hour there two hours there
13:12 it's riveting it's riveting I just had a
13:17 friend of mine send me a text and are on
13:22 Facebook and he said you know hey Joe M
13:24 from Twitter who's a part of the Q team
13:27 he makes all those videos the Q promote
13:29 says you know Michael Jackson was always
13:32 innocent and they framed him because he
13:35 wanted out of the cabal of the music
13:36 industry and we know that there's a high
13:41 chance that Michael Jackson was killed
13:45 and that that doctor that was accused of
13:48 killing him was truly in the kitchen
13:49 making a sandwich having sedated Michael
13:52 with the drug he did use I forgot the
13:56 name of it sounds like proof and all or
13:59 something like that when I was you know
14:02 here at 2009 I was in this house and the
14:05 death of Michael Jackson was announced
14:09 then the immediate live news was
14:11 covering the fact that the LAPD had a
14:14 tape of two people running away from the
14:16 house on surveillance and then the LAPD
14:18 lost it okay now it could be that these
14:23 people found out he was a pedophile
14:25 found out he was untouchable in court
14:27 because the people just won't believe it
14:29 and they just determined to do a capital
14:32 punishment maneuver but I've talked to a
14:36 few people in the music industry and in
14:39 the celebrity industry and there's
14:41 definitely it happens in the movie
14:43 industry a death of a celebrity is worth
14:46 hundreds of billions of dollars and with
14:49 the Michael Jackson it's worth tens of
14:51 billions of dollars well I don't know
14:56 how expensive you think a hit is in this
14:58 world but let's just say an average hit
15:01 you know or some puts a contract on his
15:03 wife or a business partner is fifty
15:06 thousand dollars to have a nice clean
15:07 situation okay well if you're standing
15:11 on top of the pile of money the
15:13 potential pile of money if a celebrity
15:15 dies like a prince do you pay ten
15:19 million dollars to get it done
15:20 absolutely covertly sure why not that's
15:24 good you're gonna make a I think the the
15:26 Jackson franchise made one point 1
15:29 billion dollars within twelve months of
15:31 his death of course record companies are
15:35 siphoning off everyone involved
15:36 siphoning it off it's worth a tremendous
15:40 amount of money to kill these people
15:43 it's one reason we have to get the world
15:45 straight now people but let's get into
15:48 the notion that this is a hoax because
15:51 this is what you know I wanted to finish
15:55 this for our documentary and have
15:58 holls I could talk about well that
16:00 doesn't make any sense this doesn't make
16:01 any sense and look how look how he looks
16:04 you know disingenuous on camera i look
16:06 at the mom it looks like they're lying
16:10 well if these people are lying that it
16:14 is the most elaborate hit piece I have
16:18 ever seen it would it would put the moon
16:22 hoax to shame
16:23 it really would in terms of people and
16:27 maybe not the technology but the
16:28 individuals lying about it there's more
16:31 tell signs and the press conference
16:33 after the Apollo Apollo 11 mission then
16:36 there is in this for our constant video
16:43 so one of the kids is from Simi Valley
16:45 and one of the kids is from Australia
16:47 one of the kids was about nine years old
16:50 one of them was five years old now the
16:53 molestation didn't start for a couple
16:55 years on the five-year-old but it got
16:58 pretty intense pretty intense for those
17:03 of you who are grimacing and the the
17:05 unknown is getting to you right now let
17:07 me just let me just say one thing that
17:10 didn't occur but one time for a very
17:13 split second if you take all the
17:17 testimonies of these two dudes Michael
17:20 did not engage in penetration sex with
17:23 these kids except for one attempt with
17:27 one of the kids and it didn't work and
17:32 they stopped and basically pretended
17:35 like nothing happened and went back to
17:36 their old ways there you go it's as far
17:40 down as I'm gonna go on that rabbit hole
17:43 but you have these kids that are then
17:46 you know there one of them was a dancer
17:50 who imitated Michael he's the Australian
17:52 kid the second kid in Simi Valley one
17:57 well he got into a commercial with
18:01 Michael Jackson the Pepsi commercial he
18:03 really didn't who Michael was he wasn't
18:05 enamored with him but he's the one that
18:07 did the commercial where he snuck into
18:09 Michael Jackson's
18:10 dressing-room was trying everything on
18:12 and Michael catches him and as soon as
18:15 Michael saw the kid he was just
18:17 mesmerized by him and this is the kid
18:21 that had the mock wedding when he was
18:23 nine years old
18:24 he actually has a little box of rings
18:27 that has the wedding ring in it as well
18:31 as other rings that he had to earn
18:32 through doing things with Michael and it
18:34 was all a game he was in on it they
18:36 wouldn't bought the Rings together and
18:38 they said that they were for females and
18:41 that the kid was there because his
18:42 fingers were the same size as the girls
18:44 and so this when you see the trauma of
18:48 him just trying to hold the Rings it's
18:51 amazing it's powerful but these parents
18:56 the I should say the mothers the mothers
18:59 were always the ones that were with
19:01 Michael the fathers were in there and
19:03 out of there but they didn't they had to
19:05 go earn the money and so they typically
19:08 and the mothers eventually you know
19:09 hustled like crazy to get their sons
19:11 career so hats off to both of them but
19:16 unfortunately both of them now have to
19:18 live with the fact that they trusted
19:21 this situation which was obviously
19:23 unorthodox but because Michael behaved
19:26 like a child and he was extremely
19:27 vulnerable probably for real he had
19:31 enough adult mind to conceive of this
19:34 and go for this and I don't understand
19:37 the whole thing with why the little boy
19:42 thing it just that just seems so
19:44 unbelievably bizarre I could see a guy
19:47 go and well I lost my childhood so I
19:49 want to sleep with little girls cuz I
19:50 wish I you know I mean like now little
19:52 little girls but like you know I didn't
19:55 get to have my first kiss at whatever he
19:57 thinks the age might be that's all boys
20:00 but in order to create this as a hook so
20:04 let's just say they hired one of us to
20:07 create this as a hoax you are talking
20:10 about whole families being the most
20:13 incredible actors on planet earth right
20:14 all the brothers the sisters the wives
20:19 obviously the parents again none of the
20:22 fathers were interviewed one of the
20:24 fathers that are
20:24 he passed away and he hung himself man
20:28 there's no talent this guy what hung
20:30 himself had they never met Michael
20:31 Jackson he had some bipolar issues but
20:36 you never know they left him back in
20:39 Australia and started living in the
20:40 United States to follow the kids career
20:43 and they just never came back
20:44 permanently it was sort of over I never
20:47 really talked about a divorce but when
20:50 the last kid needed to move on because
20:52 he was of age and he had some
20:54 opportunities in a different area I
20:56 think was back in the United States as
20:58 soon as the last kid left the father
21:00 hung himself that night these mothers
21:03 went through the full anger denial
21:06 negotiation and acceptance both when
21:11 they were talked out of you know
21:14 allowing their kid to sleep in his own
21:17 room by himself versus sleeping in
21:19 Michaels bedroom and this I don't know
21:22 if it was all serendipitous like it just
21:25 happened to work out but because Michael
21:27 had turned it into a pattern it doesn't
21:32 seem like that it seems like maybe it
21:36 was a mistake the first time for
21:41 instance the the first kid he goes over
21:43 who's five he has an older sister that's
21:45 it's I guess actually sorry he doesn't
21:48 come over till you seven his sister's
21:49 ten and so Michael said you wonder if
21:54 they sleep with me I've got a loft above
21:56 my bed so they go around the staircase
21:58 and we're all facing the same TV and
22:00 they could stay up up there together
22:01 brother or sister I'll stay down below
22:03 and the mom was like okay all right and
22:07 they ended up never leaving his bed
22:11 watching movies cartoons eating candy
22:14 whatever and they all just crash on the
22:16 bed and nothing occurs and that
22:18 establishes the first archetype of hey
22:21 this is okay and he's a he's a grown man
22:25 but he's also incapable of acting like
22:29 an adult so it's sort of like maybe the
22:32 12 year old brother who's hanging out
22:35 with his younger brother and sister
22:37 and that's the amazing illusion that he
22:40 put on him and quite frankly it might be
22:42 exactly who he was and so this is how he
22:46 was able to ride the razor's edge in the
22:49 parents consent model and of course the
22:51 parents are down the hallway and you
22:54 would imagine if your child was getting
22:56 touched in a strange way that your child
22:58 might respond and say something scream
23:02 leave you know Phil at least say
23:06 something the next day which would be
23:08 too late anyway but Michael didn't make
23:11 any moves right away he established
23:13 trust he started talking to the kids and
23:17 sort of brainwashing the boys and saying
23:19 look you know you shouldn't trust
23:21 anybody especially women I think that
23:23 was weird I never heard him having a
23:26 major problem with his mother he always
23:27 quoted having major problems with his
23:29 father before it being a hoax again it
23:37 would be so much coaching over over
23:40 probably months if not years to get
23:43 everyone to be able to draw on their
23:44 emotions and sob through this process
23:48 and I don't know about you for the men
23:52 out there and I don't know if anyone
23:55 listening has ever experienced something
23:56 like this with a family member or
23:58 someone else it wouldn't be easy to
24:03 admit this to the world
24:06 and that's what happened these guys
24:08 could admit it to themselves they could
24:09 admit it to their parents because when
24:11 Michael start getting busted in 93 and
24:13 getting charged for this stuff the
24:15 parents immediately went to the kids
24:16 said whoa
24:17 Kate wait a minute did you ever get
24:18 touched no no way no way they got
24:22 interviewed they testified on his behalf
24:25 the parents and the kids the parents
24:28 testified because the kids told their
24:31 parents that nothing happened and so the
24:35 parents like yeah I didn't think so but
24:36 I just you know I have to ask and so
24:39 when the kids defended him because
24:41 Michael told them very deviously
24:46 and perhaps ingeniously for his own sake
24:50 that if the police ever found out that
24:54 any of this occurred he would go to jail
24:57 and they would go to jail and so these
24:59 little kids are like I don't go to jail
25:00 I didn't know Michael had so many
25:04 apartments all over the place he had one
25:06 called the hideout in Westwood exactly
25:10 sure where the hell that is around here
25:12 he had his ranch he had little
25:18 apartments here and there and so these
25:22 kids were always invited and then it
25:24 started turning into this well one of
25:28 the tools that he used were was this
25:32 Neverland Ranch because the ranch was so
25:36 phenomenally created that even the
25:39 parents were in utter shock and awe the
25:43 parents were finding their inner child
25:45 and then you have this Michael Jackson
25:47 guy who acts like a child hanging out
25:50 with their children and so they're in
25:52 Fantasyland it is it is such a place of
25:56 wonder that you're kind of willing to
25:59 suspend to suspend any disbelief that
26:01 this isn't real and so it was a
26:04 seductive thing I would I would wager
26:10 that he had no idea that it was going to
26:12 have such an intoxicating effect on the
26:14 adults thus provide a little lubricant
26:18 pardon the pun between the kids and
26:21 their parents and in establishing this
26:23 trust when it turned into hotels or
26:29 these penthouse suites slash condos
26:32 downtown then the the technique of
26:37 creating this illusion I guess every
26:38 place he ever stayed it was always blown
26:41 out with amazing everything memorabilia
26:44 cartoons you know you could eat candy
26:47 anything you wanted you just you if you
26:49 walked into his theater and his house
26:51 and Neverland all the concessions free
26:54 everything's free how that got even
26:57 weighed 400 pounds I don't know
26:59 but then he would take the kids shopping
27:01 and he would buy them anything they want
27:05 they said he'd say get a shopping cart
27:07 and fill it with whatever you want he
27:10 would call these kids at their house
27:11 every single day he gave the kids fax
27:15 machines and he had fax them all kinds
27:17 of you know handwritten letters and then
27:19 they'd fax something back usually it's
27:20 only the boy though if the sister
27:22 answered the phone he'd only talked to
27:24 her for you know 30 to 60 seconds and it
27:27 was just get your brother get your
27:28 brother get your brother but he also
27:29 established these really close
27:31 relationships with the mother's trust
27:34 Trust trust imagine having a one hour
27:38 conversation with Michael Jackson where
27:40 he's vulnerable he's crying on the phone
27:42 he feels alone he's telling you he wants
27:45 to come back to your house I mean this
27:46 guy went to Simi Valley constantly and
27:50 spent the night could you imagine
27:52 pick your favorite star and then they
27:56 started staying with you
27:57 it's every kid's dream when you have a
28:01 movie star that you like or some sort of
28:03 celebrity that you like for them to come
28:05 and hang out with you I don't care if
28:07 it's Michael Jordan or whatever LeBron
28:10 James any of these people Johnny Depp
28:13 coming in at your house and genuinely
28:18 hanging out your house for you you know
28:20 having the barbecue doing the sleepover
28:23 he's there the next day and then the
28:24 next day they stays for a week anything
28:26 you need he just pays for it it's
28:29 surreal and because life has its
28:32 pressures it's an escape well geez
28:35 imagine you were making just enough
28:38 money to scrape by Michael comes into
28:40 your house and starts paying for food
28:41 and all the entertainment and all those
28:43 burdens that you had as a parent you're
28:45 gone you're intoxicated so I don't think
28:50 it's a hoax as much as I would love for
28:53 it to be a hoax
28:54 now what blows my mind is that he never
28:58 touched Macaulay Culkin maybe he knew
29:01 Macaulay Culkin was too famous to touch
29:05 he never touched Corey Feldman
29:07 supposedly I'm waiting to see if Corey
29:09 pops on this or
29:12 Macaulay Culkin they may just choose to
29:16 never say that they were molested thus
29:18 maintaining a stronger position in the
29:20 public eye well he never touched me but
29:24 after each one of the kids the Simi
29:26 Valley kid and the Australian kid had
29:28 their run with Michael and there was a
29:31 one occasion when Michael asked the
29:33 Australian mother I want to keep your
29:36 son for one year I will take him around
29:39 the world I will teach him how to dance
29:41 I will introduce him to everyone I will
29:42 blow up his career the other kid was
29:46 interested in filmmaking
29:47 which he ended up doing both of them did
29:49 it and and the way kid ended up being
29:52 one of the most famous choreographers in
29:56 the world and he I think he kind of did
29:58 it all by himself with his mom he's in
30:01 syncs choreographer he's Britney Spears
30:04 kr4 choreographer he's supposedly
30:07 handling every creative element of
30:09 Britney Spears most famous tours which I
30:12 assume may be stage design everything
30:14 and he's a workaholic and he you know
30:17 both guys are married both guys have
30:19 kids and you know they lied to their
30:25 parents and they lied to their well they
30:28 lied to the press they lied in court and
30:29 they lied to their wives and eventually
30:33 the kid from Australia just started he
30:36 had so much both of them have massive
30:38 PTSD and eventually the kid from
30:42 Australia just he got really really
30:44 famous he got a feature film project
30:48 with a pretty big budget and he just had
30:52 a mental breakdown it became utterly
30:57 insurmountable to reconcile what
30:59 happened to him and thinking about it
31:01 happening to his kid and he cracked and
31:04 that's when he went on television and
31:08 started telling his story and then the
31:09 other guy saw it on television and had
31:13 his wife watch it and he goes yeah
31:14 that's what happened that happened to me
31:17 too and you know I I can't I really
31:22 can't begin to fathom
31:24 being married with a wife and having two
31:27 in mid-stride tell my wife want allied
31:31 to her but to have to admit that this
31:34 kind of thing up because it's it's
31:36 emasculating even thought happened to
31:37 you when you were a kid it's still
31:41 emasculating to have to say that and you
31:45 know psychologists will probably tell
31:46 you that you know kids do things well on
31:48 the sleepovers I've heard a hundred
31:50 stories about this they experiment they
31:53 mess around but in the end those are
31:54 kids on kids right so they're being
31:56 goofy and they may only try one thing
31:58 once or whatever and then they're over
31:59 that's different this is an adult with
32:03 the kid with adult equipment it makes it
32:08 different but that gets to this this
32:12 quagmire where I remember the lawsuit in
32:16 the in the early 90s 1993 I remember the
32:18 lawsuit riah merging in the mid-2000s
32:21 and you know when in 1993 Michael looks
32:25 relatively normal kinda looks like it's
32:30 bad to her you know and so you're
32:35 watching it and you're kind of thinking
32:37 well he is really strange I think that's
32:38 what he did is Oprah interview I believe
32:43 when he started having the problems in
32:45 the 2000s that's when he really had done
32:48 somewhat surgery on his face that he
32:50 started to look like an odyssey he had
32:52 lost so much weight that that also made
32:55 him look strange I have never seen and I
33:00 have not been able to really bring
33:01 myself to watch the Michael Jackson
33:04 movie they made right after he died part
33:07 of it was it hurt because I didn't
33:11 really know anything about this other
33:12 situation but - I didn't want to be
33:16 propagandized about the guy no one's
33:19 touched Prince they have not made a
33:21 movie about him I'm sure they're trying
33:23 to I work with one of princes formers
33:26 from her producers for about a year off
33:28 and on he was interested in one of the
33:31 products I was making one of the three
33:34 dudes that took him through his whole
33:36 career
33:38 are we pulling punches with Michael
33:41 Jackson and if we are why I think the
33:45 number one reason we pull punches with
33:48 him as we loved him before any of this
33:51 was even suspected he had made an
33:56 imprint on our souls and let's just say
33:58 I mean this is rumor you got to go
34:00 pregnant way back in the Billie Jean
34:01 days and this kid was raised over in
34:03 like Switzerland or something and he
34:06 attended this kid to tend to the funeral
34:08 kinda looks like Michael if there's a
34:11 child of Michael out there I would
34:13 assume that that would be revealed at
34:16 this stage because the family would know
34:19 and why not why not come out and say
34:22 you're Michael Jackson's kid and get
34:24 Jermaine to do a little press conference
34:25 or something like that because he has
34:28 three children I think they're all
34:31 coming from different sources although a
34:33 lot of people think that the youngest
34:36 son does look like him
34:38 why wouldn't contribute his DNA to the
34:41 process is beyond me yeah you like to do
34:45 this weird [ __ ] okay at least drop some
34:46 stuff in there so I think that you know
34:50 are let's just say maybe 1985 is maybe
34:54 where he started doing this kind of
34:55 stuff I think it's probably before that
34:59 little five year old definitely was
35:02 around the smooth criminal days which I
35:04 believe is the bad album right and so
35:07 he's done all this contribution to our
35:09 life he's given us all these songs in
35:11 these videos and we've had all this
35:13 stuff and now we don't want to believe
35:14 that the good guy the ultimate good guy
35:17 is a bad guy Elvis Presley was able to
35:21 punch out without any major rumors about
35:24 anything super strange he definitely
35:27 slept with more women than his wife or
35:29 Healy's did something with him we've got
35:31 him on tape admitting to certain things
35:33 but he's a stud he was very ill when he
35:37 died and so okay he left us way too
35:42 early
35:45 everyone said he was a gentleman
35:49 just a tennessee boy as michael started
35:53 becoming a physical oddity because he
35:55 kind of considered his body i guess a
35:56 canvas of some sort it definitely opened
36:00 the door to believe almost anything that
36:02 could be thrown at him
36:04 if this is true which boy this video
36:08 looks extremely true I'm Beatrice ed to
36:11 see a debunking video on this whole
36:13 thing the kid Wade did come back and try
36:17 to sue the Jackson family for money but
36:21 they threw the case out because of
36:24 statute of limitations but this kid has
36:27 no problem making money in fact I would
36:30 assume that whatever financial goal he
36:33 might have for himself besides maybe
36:34 billions of dollars he could hit it he
36:37 could hit tens of tens of millions of
36:40 dollars easy because he's so talented
36:44 not sure exactly what the Simi Valley
36:47 kid does today I don't know it looks
36:55 like these two gentlemen are being
36:56 extremely honest but what are the other
36:59 reasons why we pull our punches well I
37:03 think part of it is that a lot of us
37:06 defended him we just thought come on if
37:10 somebody is Jackson was gonna touch
37:13 somebody I always felt that Corey
37:16 Feldman would have definitely been one
37:18 of those kids one because Corey says
37:20 he's been molested by more than one
37:23 person in Hollywood the the one name he
37:26 did drop is a guy that's you know fled
37:28 to Mexico I don't know whatever happened
37:32 to that guy know if he got extradited or
37:34 whatever I getting statute of
37:35 limitations I think in America is four
37:38 years for any type of molestation
37:40 how convenient but you did have this
37:44 movement in the 90s oh my god where
37:47 people were psychologists or
37:49 psychiatrists were hypnotizing kids and
37:52 then doing that that leading technique
37:56 of the interview to get the kid
37:59 to accuse their fathers usually as
38:01 always daughters accusing the fathers of
38:03 having molested them when they were
38:04 young and these poor dads you know we're
38:08 like what are you talking about it you
38:10 mad at me or something you know and they
38:13 would destroy lives they store their
38:15 fathers lives I'm sure there's a couple
38:17 in there that are true or even half or
38:19 whatever [ __ ] I don't know but this was
38:22 a game this was a game to to a bunch of
38:26 as I remember hearing a document it
38:29 eventually in the end cuz it disappeared
38:31 this technique disappeared out of the
38:32 common you know news feed which was that
38:35 the psychiatrists were in league with
38:37 attorneys and everybody was going to
38:39 drain everybody of money interesting so
38:45 you know I will have to eat crow the
38:52 more I accept this thing I'm in the I'm
38:55 in the kubler-ross acceptance phase
38:58 right now it will take a tremendous
39:02 amount of additional information and
39:04 it's gonna take I almost think proof
39:09 it's gonna have to take like video proof
39:11 or something else
39:14 to make me believe that these two
39:18 gentlemen cuz they're the only two that
39:20 know whether this is right or wrong then
39:22 coming out and telling I mean here's the
39:24 thing here's the thing these events of
39:27 them telling their parents telling their
39:29 one kid told his brother first and then
39:32 they needed to tell his why because his
39:34 wife is standing right there and then
39:35 later that night he had to tell his
39:36 mother and all these people recalling
39:38 these events okay one all those people
39:39 would have to be Liars which means
39:41 they're the most amazing actors I've
39:44 ever seen in our documentary which I do
39:45 not believe they're actors I believe
39:46 they're truly telling the story and then
39:51 this this other guy from Simi Valley
39:54 sees the the other guy wait go on TV and
39:58 he's doing the same thing in his
40:00 household when both of them had
40:04 exhibited major behavioral problems the
40:08 older that they got and coincidentally
40:10 after their first Born's
40:12 occurred so in order to to disrupt and
40:17 dislodge that truth it's going to be
40:22 rough I will say it right now I know at
40:29 least one very very famous person who is
40:34 going to be really struggling with this
40:36 I assume that that process has already
40:38 occurred or it's occurring right now as
40:40 this videos out there I almost I
40:43 couldn't possibly reach out and and
40:46 bring up the subject but there are going
40:51 to be stars of all calibers super
40:54 struggling with this it depends on if
40:57 they're pervs themselves of course we
41:01 don't want to believe that our heroes
41:02 have this potential one to have anything
41:05 wrong with them at all but two to take
41:06 it to that level of wrong now in
41:11 Michael's mind I'm I would put a lot of
41:15 money on a on a bet that if we put him a
41:21 truth serum in the guy and had him on a
41:23 lie-detector test and we simply said do
41:27 you think you were hurting these kids
41:29 I'm willing to bet he would say no I we
41:33 were enjoying ourselves so I mean they
41:35 were happy we did it in every single
41:37 room and my my you know Jolly Rancher
41:41 ranch right and we did it in all the
41:43 places we ever went around the world we
41:44 did it you know thousands of times and
41:48 except for one event where it didn't
41:51 work and he was I hate to even [ __ ]
41:56 say it this way he was good to stop ok
41:58 never tried it again I'm sure he thinks
42:02 he was that they were loving just as
42:05 much as he did I think that's you know
42:06 in the in the case of the sycophant
42:11 mindset of rape you know that you are
42:13 dominating another human being and their
42:15 suffering is your I guess you know what
42:18 a rapist gets off on this is kind of the
42:22 opposite polarity
42:23 your lease for Michael this you know you
42:28 mix the two together and you have
42:29 horrific situations which is more your
42:32 Lolita Island thing but I don't think we
42:36 can write Michael any blank checks as
42:39 much as we might be able to explain it
42:41 to ourselves there's that TED talk where
42:43 the woman got up and was trying to
42:46 explain pedophilia and it went around
42:49 the web and you know of course it sounds
42:51 like this woman is trying to make it
42:53 okay
42:54 not necessarily okay for everybody to
42:57 run off and do it but when it occurs
42:58 were to be like oh I'm sorry you're
43:02 having problems but now what if it just
43:07 occurred to me to say this what if
43:10 someone's having the fantasy of doing
43:11 that and they have the wherewithal to
43:15 tell someone oh I got these I'm having
43:17 those visions too and I've never ever
43:19 touched a kid in my life but I need help
43:21 how what do we do there in the between
43:24 there in this sort of purgatory between
43:26 heaven and hell they haven't done
43:28 anything wrong it's like maybe they go
43:30 to heaven or thought sins you know if
43:34 they do touch anybody well then they get
43:36 punishment on the other side I've never
43:40 heard of anyone doing that each one of
43:43 the kids found themselves being invited
43:46 back into Michael's camp and finding
43:49 another kid had taken their place
43:51 eventually I think I can't exactly run I
43:57 think Wade had a kid named Jordy replace
44:00 him and I think that the other gentleman
44:03 which I don't know why cameras name and
44:05 Macaulay Culkin replace him and it would
44:08 I would have loved to have seen the
44:10 timeline and some sort of graphic so my
44:11 brain could remember it it did seem like
44:13 there was some sort of overlap but then
44:15 again he was so obsessed with each child
44:17 each time he committed himself that it
44:20 seems like there's not enough room in
44:21 his schedule to put a second kid on the
44:23 barbie right because if you're the the
44:28 mother said that
44:32 well you know the he would talk to these
44:34 kids for like seven hours straight on
44:36 the telephone
44:36 could you imagine the phone bill back in
44:38 the day and then if you're a parent or
44:43 your person you're an adult and you just
44:45 want to get to the point where you're
44:46 like this can never happen again well
44:49 then we're like okay what do we do I
44:51 don't think too many celebrities are
44:54 going to ask to be with your child in
44:56 bed besides Michael Jackson obviously if
45:00 that request would ever come about your
45:03 child gets isolated away from you and
45:05 you there with that celebrity you you're
45:10 the hair on the back your neck will step
45:12 a stand-up now because of the story of
45:15 Michael Jackson and there's this weird
45:18 thing you know - I mean this brings up
45:23 so many different scenarios that you
45:25 don't hear about what you don't hear
45:27 about is a I mean there are cases of
45:30 this but I know I know one celebrity
45:36 personally very personally I mean I know
45:40 this person I've been to his house we've
45:42 totally played music together and done
45:44 all this other [ __ ] and he was young he
45:47 was actually yeah I knew him before he
45:50 was 18 and then I knew him after was 18
45:52 and he was involved in a situation where
45:57 he was he had been sleeping with a woman
46:01 in her 30s and the case was put out
46:08 there that she was taking advantage of
46:10 him if you knew this kid he's a good kid
46:14 he's a normal guy he loves sex just like
46:18 any kid this was just a conquest he
46:21 definitely is not sucking his thumb
46:22 curled up in some [ __ ] ball somewhere
46:24 okay he's telling his buddies I am and I
46:27 tapped that trust me
46:29 hurry now he's not psychologically
46:31 damaged okay but you don't hear about
46:34 this algorithm from a woman to a little
46:37 boy you said I don't hear about it
46:39 telling you this might sound crazy but
46:42 every little kid
46:44 there's a normal like heterosexual boy
46:46 when you're young probably nine and up
46:49 once when your sexuality starts kind of
46:50 peeking into the to the reality and your
46:52 friends are all starting to experiment
46:54 and then you know boys start talking to
46:56 each other I mean I don't think I
46:58 discovered my sexuality well the things
47:03 all right I'd already played with girls
47:04 before I ever play with myself but I
47:07 remember I remember being taught how to
47:09 do that by one of my buddies it was just
47:11 like you ever do this I'm like what's
47:12 that and it was when you do this oh you
47:14 can do that oh yeah okay I'll let you
47:17 know man and we're all like wow that
47:19 works
47:19 I could totally solve my own problems
47:21 now try to keep that ism symbolic is
47:25 possible in the conversation so that the
47:28 the vividness doesn't make you want to
47:30 hurl in your mouth too late men have
47:36 always been portrayed it's it's funny
47:38 when I was a kid
47:39 the one cartoon that was always showing
47:41 up as a kid and it was sort of kind of
47:44 confusing to me was this the caveman
47:46 with the stick and he hit a girl on the
47:49 head I think this was in several movies
47:50 too I think it was even in Ringo Starr's
47:53 movie and it was his caveman movie and
47:56 it was in I believe history of the world
47:59 part one but once the the scenario was a
48:03 caveman hits a woman on the head knocks
48:06 her out and he drags her away and you
48:08 know I guess you're assuming something
48:09 is going to happen it's his woman now
48:12 that's the way I always thought these
48:14 kind of things were going to occur adult
48:16 man or older guy whatever because we're
48:19 all programmed to procreate right we're
48:20 the conquerors were we have to go out
48:23 and kill things to eat you know I mean
48:25 we stopped we just stopped that process
48:28 do you realize that do you realize that
48:32 in America you went out and hunted your
48:36 food probably until like hell I don't
48:39 know 1920 and you know a lot of people
48:43 kept going all the way into the middle
48:44 of the 20th century because they live
48:46 down in the Ozarks or whatever you went
48:49 out and you hunted a boar you hunted
48:50 your venison you raised livestock and
48:53 had to slaughter it
48:57 and now we just go to the grocery store
49:00 so that alpha gene that gene that was if
49:03 you didn't have a husband that was
49:04 strong you needed to live in a village
49:07 where you're you know your beta male
49:10 could go out with the alpha males and
49:13 kill the Beast in fact you could be an
49:15 alpha male but you just didn't have the
49:16 body to back up your your instincts and
49:20 so you had to be out there with other
49:24 people to survive and so this this carry
49:27 straight into sexuality what what still
49:31 blows my mind is okay you miss your
49:33 childhood Michael okay great why boys
49:37 you know something happened with his
49:39 mother I never heard him spending much
49:42 time with his mother he's always in a
49:44 studio peeing in a cup and and you know
49:47 hanging out with his brothers and being
49:48 around guys guys guys guys you'd almost
49:50 think he'd be more of a heterosexual
49:52 because that was what he didn't have
49:57 it's the mystery to conquer you know not
49:59 to conquer and aggressively but just to
50:02 kind of solve the mystery I mean if you
50:03 lived in a particular area of the world
50:05 that was beautiful and but you only knew
50:07 your little tiny area but you could look
50:09 over the hill every time you got up to a
50:11 high place and be like I'll have
50:12 something really nice over there a guy
50:15 just wants to go look at that stuff
50:17 secure it explore it and then bring the
50:21 family over there whatever expand your
50:23 own empire take over more land the
50:28 circular logic back to your own sex for
50:30 me will remain a mystery especially
50:34 especially in the case of pedophilia I
50:38 don't know if one can claim but it might
50:42 be possible to theorize as ludicrous as
50:46 this might sound the the silver lining
50:50 that might come out of this um some sort
50:53 of maturation benefit for Humanity might
50:59 be that we sort of wake up to this whole
51:01 thing we stop making excuses we stop I
51:07 mean we you know those of us live in LA
51:10 Angeles and I've had the privilege of
51:13 working with extremely talented people
51:14 who are very dedicated yes when you're
51:17 in the room with these people you will
51:20 stare across the room and just as a an
51:22 academic entrepreneurial standpoint you
51:27 are marveling at this human being that
51:30 yeah they might have been in the right
51:31 place at the right time but the amount
51:33 of skills that they had to manifest to
51:36 get that opportunity to trigger is
51:38 really amazing and the more that they
51:42 accomplish like a prince the dude was
51:45 punished by being locked in his fully
51:48 furnished basement of his father's house
51:50 with the piano and sleeping quarters and
51:52 all that kind of stuff but he practice
51:53 on the piano is just you know whatever
51:56 and his father was a jazz musician so
51:58 when he hears his son playing he doesn't
52:00 go down and stop him you can't have any
52:01 fun he's like good practice that piano
52:04 so he just got familiar with it and he
52:06 moved on to the next thing and the next
52:07 thing and the next thing that eventually
52:09 creates volumes of albums that are so
52:12 incredibly unique from each other it's
52:13 mind-blowing and if you like that type
52:16 of music he makes or made it just
52:20 eclipses all the other stuff that's
52:22 coming out of the jukebox that's just
52:24 sort of like cut and paste and the other
52:27 thing you'll notice when you meet people
52:29 that are um that have had these
52:31 incredible lives and I know good half
52:35 dozen of them we're from a young age 18
52:39 or up some of them were younger than
52:42 that that I know they were so famous
52:44 from such a young age and still famous
52:47 to this day that they didn't have to
52:49 mature were you and I ever getting our
52:52 ass kicked by by the world and having to
52:54 to learn how to compromise our desires
52:57 they didn't have to do that they could
53:00 be babies they could run any I don't
53:04 like this yeah you know I want this to
53:06 be different and people like yes ma'am
53:08 yes sir whatever you want because
53:10 they're starstruck and they got the
53:11 money to back up whatever they won
53:15 Michael quite frankly might be the most
53:21 famous person that has lived in my
53:24 lifetime so that star power was like
53:29 really immeasurable and it created that
53:34 reality distortion field around him well
53:38 the more of amazing insights that these
53:40 both these guys that are in the
53:42 documentary contribute to the
53:44 documentary and obviously to us via the
53:47 documentary is that that tug of war
53:52 between you know when the abuse starts
53:57 occurring they don't know it's wrong but
54:01 they also love this guy on a level that
54:03 is like any one of the kids of that time
54:06 it's okay to love Michael Jackson before
54:09 he started doing this especially if you
54:12 didn't know he was doing this hey that's
54:15 just humanity it's just what we are
54:16 you're being deceived and so this guy
54:20 would show up at a concert show up at a
54:22 location an airport a hotel a restaurant
54:24 he'd go shopping and people are like
54:27 losing their minds outside anything you
54:31 want you can have one because probably a
54:34 lot of people give it to you but two he
54:38 can afford it you have an extremely
54:41 close for close friend of mine who was
54:42 hired by Michael in two different
54:44 occasions and we're talking about
54:47 getting a phone call Michael wants to
54:50 see you you know they were not quite his
54:54 generation was two people work together
54:57 and they say well the limousines come
55:01 into your house there's gonna be a plane
55:04 waiting for you to get from there to
55:05 there there'll be a helicopter getting
55:06 you from there to there and it's just
55:08 like this fantasy world you get in this
55:10 car and you're VIP the whole way when
55:13 you stay with him it's VIP and then you
55:15 fly all the way back VIP even if you
55:19 have a lot of money it's still out of
55:22 his [ __ ] world it really is and
55:26 imagine a child trying to reconcile all
55:28 this in their mind we're teaching our
55:32 kids to want to be famous and I know
55:34 that you know I say I give examples all
55:38 the
55:38 time that our celebrity based examples
55:42 of creativity and I also did an episode
55:45 on Fame which sort of enesta sizes
55:48 vaccinates you against this notion that
55:50 Fame is anything in life you should ever
55:53 go for it you really if you are still
55:56 trying to be famous in this world
55:59 you got to stop just do what you love
56:04 and if Fame comes with it then fine you
56:08 know I heard an interesting admission
56:10 from Bennett Cerf he's one of the
56:13 gentleman's he was he was a big
56:17 publisher back in the 30s 40s 50s and
56:20 Beyond he would gave us the the
56:22 dictionary one of the first printed
56:24 dictionaries back in the day surf
56:27 publishing he talked about being on
56:30 What's My Line and he was let he was
56:32 interviewed I think in 1968 after the
56:34 show was cancelled the year before it's
56:38 only like a four and a half minute
56:39 interview but I guess there's like four
56:40 parts to it so it's it's fascinating to
56:42 hear him talk about it but he he was
56:44 just a gentle man and his wife and kids
56:50 and also their stuff and he said you
56:51 know I won't lie to you he goes I loved
56:54 being famous from that show he goes
56:57 anywhere I went people knew me they want
56:58 to shake my hands they wanted to to buy
57:01 me dinner or something a guy who was
57:03 loaded he didn't need anything but of
57:04 course you can't turn that down when
57:05 someone wants to get you something it's
57:07 it's rude and they want to go home and
57:09 say they bought somebody a drink or
57:11 someone a dinner or whatever but he
57:16 admitted it and he gave a really lucid
57:18 definition of it and he said you know he
57:20 said it in a way that for probably one
57:23 of the very first times I've ever heard
57:25 anyone admit they loved Fame but that he
57:29 didn't let it really get to him as a man
57:31 he didn't go home to his wife
57:32 differently didn't go home to his
57:33 children differently and if you have to
57:37 accept the fame for something that
57:38 you've done that would be a great
57:41 example to go listen to it took these
57:45 kids I guess they're grown men and I
57:47 shouldn't say that took these two
57:49 gentlemen who are in this documentary
57:52 you know years to deal with I would say
57:56 quite technically decades it seems like
57:59 it took both of them two decades to
58:01 admit it to their family that these
58:03 things occurred and they were in the
58:05 epicenter of it all they were the ones
58:07 that were going a little bit bonkers as
58:10 a result of sort of the PTSD of the
58:13 moment I mean imagine we don't really
58:17 have I mean some of you have dealt with
58:18 this right and I'm not looking for any
58:22 of you to admit this in the comments
58:23 section so don't feel any obligation for
58:26 me I'm not trying to push anybody in
58:29 this area your life is your life and
58:31 it's your business none of my business
58:34 but you know when something happens like
58:37 I remember events when I was a little
58:40 kid I met Vince when I first moved to
58:41 California some of them just
58:43 photographically amazing
58:45 but imagine committing or participating
58:48 in this abuse for over you know probably
58:52 just shy of 10 years apiece and then
58:56 it's 20 years ago you start having your
58:59 own kids you start thinking through your
59:00 own actions and and sort of what could
59:02 happen to your kids and you start trying
59:04 to reconcile the frustration of the
59:06 whole event and then he dies of course
59:08 like it was a 2009 he dies and you then
59:12 you kind of put it put it to bed well
59:14 maybe I don't have to say anything for
59:15 the rest of my life or maybe I can say
59:16 something now because he's dead
59:19 both these guys tried to hold it in
59:22 tried to deny it and it started eating
59:25 them alive
59:28 there's probably other things in our
59:30 lives that have occurred that aren't
59:31 that deep that intense or maybe it's it
59:36 maybe it's as intense but it's not as
59:38 sexually explicit of course and we need
59:43 to purge who knows it really made me
59:48 think about I've had a lot of
59:51 conversations recently with close
59:53 friends of mine about just sort of being
59:57 an open book with your life and not
60:01 lying so you have to hang on to the lie
60:03 and try to figure out what did I say
60:05 oh my god you know I've never lived that
60:09 life I've never had to live that life I
60:11 mean I guess I've been lucky super lucky
60:14 they talked one of them said you know
60:18 when you tell when you hold this stuff
60:20 in you have to hold this lie in and
60:22 because they had to constantly defend
60:24 him up to a point they it starts to you
60:31 know re-energize that horrible acidic
60:34 ball in their chest that they're hanging
60:36 on to this big act of deception I can
60:40 only begin to fathom what that might be
60:44 like I just even start going towards the
60:48 empathetic mindset of what they might be
60:51 going through it just it's so intensely
60:53 vile that I mean hats off that they've
60:57 been able to reset their lives to the
61:00 extent they have and I'm sure both of
61:02 them will be dealing with it for a while
61:03 it seems like the one of the guys from
61:05 Simi Valley he's still dealing with it
61:08 he was extremely articulate about that
61:11 and just I don't know I think by them
61:15 sharing their experience they have
61:18 helped us deal with the little things
61:20 that we deal with so now as we close off
61:25 here there I'm gonna bring up a weird
61:30 analogy for you a will that weird
61:32 comparison for you if you've chronically
61:37 listen to my episodes which I'm sure a
61:38 lot of you haven't because the subject
61:40 matter is gonna draw people in that have
61:41 never seen this show before
61:42 maybe shadow bending doesn't kill it
61:45 first I've told you guys the Statue of
61:48 Liberty is a gift from France right
61:50 remember that it was complete in 1885
61:53 it's really the bankers of Europe trying
61:56 to stamp America with ownership now we
62:01 have and they also wrote they wrote the
62:04 saying there's you know give us your
62:06 tired your weary trying to create a
62:08 migration from Europe to break the back
62:10 of America and you know lo and behold
62:14 that brought us some of the best DNA
62:17 we've ever had
62:19 they fought you know gangs in New York
62:21 [ __ ] happened and then they we kind of
62:23 got along some people are extremely
62:26 proud about going through Ellis Island
62:27 now now technically speaking if the
62:32 Great Awakening were to reset the world
62:35 all this Masonic [ __ ] needs to go away
62:38 doesn't it we don't want that symbology
62:40 all over the place secret societies just
62:44 determining where our streets are you
62:46 know Washington DC's all got these
62:48 pentagrams and pyramids and owls the
62:50 Owls are the assistant to the Queen
62:53 Semiramis Queen Semiramis or Ishtar is
62:55 the Statue of Liberty Columba Columbia
63:01 Pictures same thing well technically
63:05 speaking I don't know how we leave all
63:08 that stuff up if we were to really clean
63:11 the world off so you you reset society
63:14 you say we rewrite our Constitution and
63:16 get Europe their constitutions updated
63:19 so that tyranny and weird [ __ ] over
63:20 there doesn't happen anymore
63:22 how do we keep all these symbols of
63:24 control worshiped technically speaking
63:28 as much as it would make me feel strange
63:32 I think they need to be disassembled or
63:36 maybe redone in a way that completely
63:39 erases this this worship statue
63:44 liberties in ghostbusters man
63:51 ghostbusters 2 right okay we love the
63:57 Statute of Liberty it's a thing that
63:59 when people see it they cry but
64:01 technically it's a symbol of control and
64:05 not a good one okay I made my point now
64:09 let's go back to Michael Jackson there
64:12 are radio stations right now I'm pulling
64:13 his records never to play him again
64:16 we'll see if it holds but now I have all
64:20 these memories of Michael Jackson's
64:23 music and you know technically in my
64:26 brain I could say okay let's just say
64:28 that he didn't touch anyone from 1985
64:30 and back
64:31 to his birth and so all that music
64:33 thriller off the wall and his Jackson
64:36 five stuff I can still listen to it
64:38 because it was the innocent Michael that
64:40 wasn't touching kids and everything
64:41 after that we throw it away because it
64:43 is part of the lesser era of his
64:46 existence culturally speaking depending
64:50 on how old you are
64:51 and I would say probably um you know I'm
64:55 probably one of the youngest people but
64:57 again they that guy conquered the world
64:58 at all ages for the rest for his entire
65:00 life right so he's showing up in the
65:03 2000s and little kids are just running
65:05 up to him so I think this his span of
65:08 people worshipping him and people aren't
65:11 gonna believe this and people aren't
65:12 gonna watch this documentary that's
65:13 that's what's also going to take place
65:16 we struggle this we struggle with this
65:19 same sort of thing with religious
65:21 saviors that never existed and and we
65:24 can't reconcile it because we built our
65:26 whole life around our saviors and so
65:29 we're still stuck in these paradigms and
65:30 this is where kids get left with
65:33 churches and they get molested by
65:35 preachers and because these preachers
65:38 are just like Michael Jackson they're
65:39 untouchable they're they're God's voice
65:42 they are the authorities on heaven
65:44 they've created this extortion ISM thing
65:47 where it's like because of original sin
65:49 you got to go through a church to get
65:50 the God and if you don't go the church
65:52 you're gonna go to hell and fire
65:53 brimstone all these [ __ ] stories
65:55 right something we also need to let go
65:57 of that's my opinion
66:00 you'll feel extremely liberated when you
66:02 when you can do that and you don't have
66:04 to hate all the lessons that these
66:06 churches bring you just acknowledge it
66:09 for the sweet wonderful thing that it is
66:11 it's a story it's a parable it's a pity
66:13 a savior that teaches you in parable is
66:16 a parable himself but with Michael he's
66:20 very real
66:21 he's extremely real hmm I don't sit
66:27 around playing Michael Jackson music at
66:28 my house everyone swim although I get
66:31 off the wall out that's the you know
66:35 working day and night those kind of
66:36 songs hmm sometimes Billie Jean oh come
66:39 on after I haven't heard it for five or
66:42 ten years and
66:43 as soon as that bassline comes in man it
66:47 just has this emotion brings you back to
66:50 all these times when you know I was
66:52 living in the Midwest and we didn't have
66:54 Disneyland and and surfboards and lush
66:58 palm trees everywhere it was cold and
67:00 dirty and not you know we did make a lot
67:03 of money so everybody was kind of
67:04 struggling but we ended up loving each
67:06 other instead of worshipping celebrities
67:08 too much you know he's Michael Jackson
67:12 gonna be erased hmm well I have my
67:19 doubts and the reason why I have my
67:20 doubts is that we have former presidents
67:22 who were complete rapists who are still
67:25 making money at speeches still able to
67:28 show up in public societies looked
67:32 completely the other way when women were
67:36 raped
67:38 we have famous film people who have
67:42 admitted to taking the virginity of
67:46 young teenage girls some went into exile
67:50 for decades and came back we have famous
67:53 film people that have married their step
67:55 kids and they're still okay Michaels
68:01 dead now those people are still alive
68:03 and they're still collecting a paycheck
68:08 you know I think this is I think that
68:12 the leaving Neverland if it's true and
68:15 it certainly looks like it is if it's
68:18 true it is probably one of the most
68:22 monumental cultural bombshells that I
68:25 have ever heard of let alone personally
68:28 experienced in my living room not more
68:30 than a couple hours ago when I finished
68:32 the series there are lessons to be
68:35 learned in all situations right I'm not
68:39 even sure what the lessons are exactly
68:41 we know some low-hanging fruit lessons
68:43 but men I think there's some pretty
68:47 hefty lessons that are yet to be
68:49 discovered
68:51 triage by our brain and embedded into
68:55 our value system
68:57 yeah no one has any qualms or um I think
69:02 doubts about whether or not this should
69:04 have taken place or should should
69:06 shouldn't have taken place we all know
69:07 that's not allowed we don't do this to
69:10 kids but it's us accepting the fact that
69:14 one of our heroes may be former heroes
69:18 now did this all the time thousands of
69:23 times with different kids what it's just
69:28 coming to mind right now is that there
69:30 was the things is that the documentary
69:33 didn't seem to cover which I don't know
69:35 if it's true or not anymore I know I
69:37 have quoted as being true because it was
69:39 presented to me as truth is that one of
69:41 the kids fathers extorted money out of
69:43 Michael and I remember being in the car
69:46 in the bay area and they played the
69:48 audio tape the guy left with his
69:50 attorney it was a voice voicemail an
69:54 answering machine thing and the guy says
69:56 I know Michael didn't touch my kid but
69:58 don't you think it's worth twenty-five
69:59 million dollars if we accuse him of it
70:02 so that is something I heard with my own
70:05 ears from the guy's mouth there was the
70:08 the kid that I think was accused he came
70:11 into Michael Jackson's Neverland and he
70:14 claimed he had cancer and then it was
70:17 later Dean he didn't have cancer so that
70:20 seems like it was a scam and they tried
70:22 just I guess that was the kid that made
70:23 the ten million dollars or something
70:24 like that I don't that's the same kid I
70:27 was saying father same kid I don't know
70:29 the maid that said she caught Michael in
70:33 the shower doing something sexual with
70:35 little boy and then there's the same
70:37 maid I think said that she saw him
70:39 showering with the boy
70:41 of course not dressed they supposedly
70:46 got her to admit she made it up so
70:49 what's going on I mean it was she paid
70:50 off to say she made it up and she's
70:52 actually telling the truth it's that
70:56 reasonable doubt they keep inserting in
70:57 everyone's mind right the jurors from
71:01 his 2005 hearing on a camera when it
71:05 actually concluded someone in that realm
71:07 they were interviewed after the fact
71:10 television and you know these old ladies
71:12 said that the the defendant or I guess
71:15 the mother of one of the kids was being
71:18 very angry at the jury she pointed a
71:23 finger or something at the juror and she
71:25 said boy when she did that to me I was
71:27 gonna stick it to her you don't point
71:29 your finger at me okay maybe the mother
71:32 is really angry because she knows that
71:35 this happened to her kid and so because
71:36 she's not being pleasant she loses in
71:39 court so I am interested in your
71:43 comments obviously this will draw folks
71:46 in that are just going to be you know
71:48 Michaels innocent forever hey you're
71:52 listening to the voice of a guy that
71:53 wishes he was completely innocent and
71:55 that these guys never existed and that
71:57 the only thing we had as an accusation
72:00 was nothing more than an accusation with
72:02 no evidence you know no ability to
72:06 synchronize two different guys with two
72:11 different experiences with him and again
72:14 I in the conclusion of the documentary
72:17 it was pretty apparent that they hadn't
72:19 met each other but when you listen to
72:20 their detailed descriptions of what took
72:22 place in this bedroom there were very
72:25 specific things that I don't think a lot
72:28 of people do in this world and
72:30 especially with kids and so there's
72:33 story sync perfectly and so it seems
72:38 like the odds of that being fraudulent
72:41 go down quite a bit but what is the
72:46 kubler-ross stages right anger denial
72:51 negotiation then acceptance well there's
72:55 going to be people stuck on those first
72:56 two for the remainder of their life
73:00 lives so yes I don't like to have that
73:04 kind of stuff
73:05 rattling rattling around inside my mind
73:07 you know I think that's all I've got
73:11 we'll do a super-short bumper there's a
73:14 website deep thoughts radio calm
73:16 everything's up there that's all you
73:19 need to know take care of yourself and
73:21 someone else and I'll see in the next
73:23 deep
73:23 it's over now
