00:02 [Music]
00:23 you
00:24 [Music]
00:34 good evening ladies and gentlemen and
00:36 welcome back to deep thoughts I realized
00:40 for some of you it's good morning we're
00:43 such as globalist are we so as you can
00:46 see today today finally we're going to
00:49 do a dedicated episode to the lunacy of
00:53 global warming which has been rebranded
00:57 climate change why well why the [ __ ]
01:01 does Hillary hide a bunch of [ __ ] on an
01:03 email server because they're all [ __ ]
01:05 criminals right today's weird it's gonna
01:08 glow me gloomy outside and I started
01:10 thinking about I thought I can't
01:13 remember if I've actually done a
01:14 dedicated episode to global warming I
01:15 mean you hear me talk about it quite a
01:17 bit on the first three seasons but now
01:21 it's a really good time because the
01:26 elite of the world the elites ain't a'no
01:29 sticks [ __ ] bags are all getting together
01:32 and now they are formally rolling out
01:36 just like they always [ __ ] do all the
01:39 [ __ ] they've already been doing that
01:41 they said that we were [ __ ] crazy if
01:43 we saw it occurring like chemtrails in
01:45 the sky right now I can't say that every
01:49 single thing that you know we see on the
01:51 internet it's true you know Bill Gates
01:54 it was an article about him supporting a
01:57 group that is going to try and create a
02:01 control volcanic explosion to blow a
02:03 bunch of [ __ ] in the sky to reduce
02:05 global warming temperatures now I know
02:09 nerds get really [ __ ] arrogant about
02:11 what they can do but controlling the
02:15 volcanic explosion or a volcanic
02:19 explosion of something of an existing
02:21 volcano or something that's just so many
02:24 hundreds of years beyond where we are
02:26 right now that's like [ __ ]
02:28 terraforming right yeah we're gonna land
02:31 on Mars and create a atmosphere now I
02:34 want to be upfront with you one of the
02:39 greatest resources I have ever found on
02:41 this subject matter is a movie called
02:44 the great global warming swindle
02:47 it was a group of filmmakers documentary
02:50 filmmakers that had found the first six
02:52 IPCC scientists that the UN hired to try
02:58 and staple this climate change thing
03:01 into reality all six of them sued to
03:05 have their names pulled out of Al Gore's
03:07 list of people that said that he was
03:09 writing that documentary is worth its
03:13 weight in gold or diamonds or rubies or
03:17 emeralds whatever is the most valuable
03:19 commodity on this planet that's how
03:22 valuable that documentary is inside it
03:25 you have one of the leading
03:26 meteorologists professors at MIT one of
03:29 the cofounders of Greenpeace one of the
03:31 top patent holding climate
03:33 climatologists at NASA and about three
03:37 other folks that are just known for
03:39 being world experts couple of our really
03:42 introverted nerds you also have a
03:45 defector at a Margaret Thatcher's
03:47 Department in the 70s and the margaret
03:49 thatcher's you know the prime minister
03:51 government of england when the whole
03:54 thing was hatched and he has seen it for
03:57 40 years
03:58 he said now you've seen it for 50 years
04:00 but he will tell you right on right
04:03 inside the film where it all came from
04:06 at least from the European side of
04:09 things now what's interesting is is with
04:12 all agendas with all scams they
04:17 originate on paper usually a decade or
04:21 so before they actually get debuted into
04:22 public this was around I think almost 20
04:29 years before it actually became a Kyoto
04:33 agreement draft before it started
04:35 becoming climate change [ __ ] taxation
04:37 carbon taxation so let's cut to the
04:41 straight cut to the chase excuse me
04:42 right away global warming now call
04:48 climate change because it ain't global
04:50 warmin is 100% about depopulation of
04:55 this planet it is about creating a
04:58 taxation system that will tax
05:00 a parent from having a child everyone
05:04 who's [ __ ] broke doesn't have kids
05:05 right
05:06 because kids cost money that's the
05:09 overall agenda we know that they have
05:13 been concerned about the population
05:15 explosion at least overtly since they
05:18 built the Georgia Guidestones it was a
05:21 pace who or who built them but to recap
05:26 the first commandment in these 10
05:28 commandments of which 2 through 10 you
05:30 could probably live with pretty good but
05:32 the first one is reduce the world
05:33 population to 500 million and balance
05:37 with nature they can maybe see a
05:40 perpetual balance with nature but the
05:42 idea is 500 million people from 7.5
05:45 billion is about a 98% reduction a
05:48 little higher well if you think that
05:50 they're not if you think for a second
05:52 that they're not going to start with the
05:53 maximum you know amounts are if you
05:57 don't want to have to kill first Born's
05:58 because they started at 500 million
06:00 they're probably gonna start about 150
06:04 that's my guess
06:05 they don't have to deal with this
06:07 problem for a while maybe 250 if they
06:09 think they can truly control the
06:11 reproduction of humans maybe they will
06:15 but regardless were way over 99% now 99%
06:19 of the world dies hmm did you imagine a
06:24 world built out of these [ __ ]
06:26 like they're the only ones that get to
06:28 go to the other side and they're so
06:30 happy Obama and John Kerry and the
06:33 [ __ ] king and queen of this and that
06:35 and this Eyes Wide Shut [ __ ] heads yeah
06:38 we're gonna cuss a lot in this one so
06:40 just brace yourself I'm sorry but no one
06:44 would be willing to get their hands
06:46 dirty on in any way shape or form they'd
06:48 all be [ __ ] around on each other
06:50 constantly screwing each other they're
06:52 just incapable human beings they are
06:54 truly the B Ark and they think they're
06:57 the a Ark right they're the phone
06:59 sanitizers and the executive marketing
07:01 people and all this other stuff right
07:03 but they're even below the most menial
07:07 thing you could possibly define
07:11 all they're good at is being
07:12 manipulative devious
07:15 well concentrate a world of that
07:17 thank God would just pull the goddamn
07:19 plug I don't need to see what happens
07:21 here is the foregone conclusion I didn't
07:23 make mankind and come up with these
07:25 [ __ ] but the question is where did
07:28 it originate and according to this
07:30 individual that worked for Margit
07:32 Thatcher his hypothesis which i think is
07:36 fairly fairly apt here is that the coal
07:40 miners of England for those of Americans
07:42 coal was one of the core methodologies
07:46 of creating electricity for England in
07:49 the 70s and many decades before that
07:52 this was extremely important but England
07:56 had an issue on a labour party or
07:59 whatever don't know what the deal was
08:01 but the coal miners weren't getting
08:03 treated very well and so they rebelled
08:06 by going on strike and not taking coal
08:09 look at black lung I mean you know I
08:12 don't even know that the plethora of
08:14 issues these guys must have dealt with
08:17 but here they are a vital part of the
08:19 society and they're being treated like
08:20 dirt literally right so they went on
08:24 strike they brought England to a
08:26 screeching halt I personally don't know
08:29 if what losses occurred as a result of
08:31 that but if there weren't losses the
08:33 Margaret Thatcher wouldn't been pissed
08:35 off I'd say that much but she walked
08:37 into her I don't know her little house
08:41 there on the street this dudes in there
08:43 and she says I want you to kill coal
08:46 however you possibly can so find me an
08:49 alternative power source with these this
08:51 resource is no longer needed and I'm
08:53 going to essentially [ __ ] over every
08:56 single family that just thought that
08:58 they should be treated decently now I
09:01 want to rewind this for just one second
09:04 these people that dig coal the
09:07 old-fashioned way
09:08 drilling holes into mountain sides and
09:10 their pickaxe and [ __ ] out and using
09:12 jackhammers and all this other stuff
09:14 breathing in this stuff living a shorter
09:18 lifespan living a more difficult
09:21 lifespan before they die because they're
09:23 sick
09:24 somehow that wasn't enough for Margaret
09:27 Thatcher and her controlling you know
09:32 group of monarchs above her they needed
09:35 to somehow give a little bit more or
09:36 shut up and just do their job now I
09:40 think most normal people that listen to
09:42 me understand how unbelievably
09:46 self-centered and just scummy that is
09:50 these this is the kind of person we're
09:54 talking about that would set up there
09:56 and she's just the bottom of the barrel
09:58 I mean she is actually sorry you know
10:01 how we're gonna orient this thing but
10:02 she is just entry-level scumbag eree
10:06 so this man continues to discuss the
10:10 fact that they wanted to figure out a
10:11 way to demonize coal now for obviously
10:14 an additional decade you have a problem
10:17 where it is the only resource available
10:19 but we started getting into nuclear
10:21 power plants but those things are very
10:23 dangerous and take a tremendous amount
10:25 of time to create so wasn't a quick fix
10:31 now I tell you guys that I marathon
10:33 shows one because they're super
10:35 entertaining but two because I learned
10:36 from the writing and I have now seen
10:39 global warming references in Cheers
10:44 which was but I think about the early
10:46 80s to the early 90s and it had dropped
10:49 in Frayser the sequel the spin-off
10:52 sequel with Kelsey Grammer I've seen it
10:54 in Star Trek 15 years before Al Gore got
11:01 on a stage and lied to the entire world
11:04 what's the theory of global warming and
11:08 if anyone says climate change you change
11:10 it back to global warming in the
11:12 conversation because that is the
11:16 indicator of the lie they changed the
11:18 name because the name they initially
11:19 gave it was not working out so much for
11:25 him the theory is that man in his Oh his
11:32 evilness to be on this planet is
11:34 creating carbon footprints
11:37 our cars our factories the method of our
11:41 electricity but but wait a minute did
11:46 you pick the power methodology that your
11:51 society uses I know I didn't I didn't
11:53 get a choice did I pick the type of
11:57 engine that goes into my car well not
12:01 really I mean now they give me sort of a
12:02 hybrid option but they want to [ __ ] me
12:05 with a really huge price on it right you
12:09 know they haven't got the batteries up
12:10 to a level where you know you can really
12:12 travel long distances so pure electrics
12:15 really kind of out of the question
12:17 so who's getting blamed for what right
12:21 this is say they're true to say that
12:23 they're right but they're not but let's
12:26 just say that they're right whose
12:28 [ __ ] fault is it right I don't make
12:30 the choice in whether or not it's a coal
12:32 plant down the street or an oil plant or
12:34 a gas plant I don't personally make the
12:38 decisions about the smokestacks that are
12:41 sitting in China just barfing out this
12:42 [ __ ] 24/7 oh one night so it happens to
12:45 be a country that's completely absolved
12:46 from any recognition of this [ __ ]
12:49 story in the first place
12:50 India being the second company country
12:52 that doesn't have to acknowledge any
12:54 form of climate reform what's the theory
13:00 the theory is is that we create too much
13:02 co2 in the atmosphere and that it's
13:07 making the world get hotter because it
13:10 contributes to the greenhouse gas layer
13:13 index okay and what that is is that's
13:17 probably best imagined as a piece of
13:19 paper with a list of chemicals that are
13:22 in the greenhouse gas layer that
13:25 contribute 100% to the sun's rays not
13:28 escaping its roots reflection off the
13:32 surface of the earth right so sun rays
13:34 come down hit us and they bounce up
13:37 supposedly I mean lights are visible
13:39 everywhere right and but this cloud this
13:42 layer of chemicals keeps it in right mmm
13:46 now what you need to remember it's
13:48 called the greenhouse gas layer index
13:50 index has an index cards right every
13:54 card is another chemical and it's
13:55 percentage of contribution to this
13:57 overall box which is called the
13:59 greenhouse gas layer index so they say
14:05 that co2 is the big [ __ ] problem all
14:09 right let's get inside that box and get
14:11 this problem solved right so you open
14:13 the box
14:14 yeah sure is a [ __ ] ton of chemicals in
14:18 this thing all right all right
14:20 so you find co2 and you pull it out now
14:22 the first field we're gonna have on this
14:24 little recipe card inside our indexes
14:26 how much is in the greenhouse gas layer
14:30 index of all the chemicals in this box
14:32 what's the percentage of co2 up in the
14:36 atmosphere it contributes to the warming
14:39 of the earth well according to the
14:44 meteorologists professor at MIT in the
14:47 movie great global warming Swindell and
14:49 a few other guys in there it's point
14:53 zero five four percent of a single
14:56 percent hmm well how do we figure out
15:00 what that is that's like seems like
15:01 nothing it's because it is nothing so if
15:06 you go one decimal place you know into a
15:09 number you put the polar decimal to the
15:11 left and your point one that's one tenth
15:14 that's what we call that first digit
15:17 well what do we have on our greenhouse
15:19 gas layer [ __ ] card for co2 we got a
15:22 zero no we're not even there yet aren't
15:25 even starting to measure this yet we're
15:27 in a tenth we go in another decimal
15:30 place that's a hundredth no so now we're
15:34 5/100 of a single percent we got a four
15:38 in here too oh that's like that's
15:41 another 10x oh it's in there for one
15:43 thousandth okay to make this easy for
15:46 you take a dollar bill in your brain
15:49 there's two ways you can express the
15:51 dollar bill a piece of paper says the
15:53 dollar on it or you can get a hundred
15:54 pennies but we need to come down to one
15:56 percent so we can start getting a
15:59 concept
16:00 how much co2 is in the greenhouse gas
16:03 layer well right away you got 99 pennies
16:04 on the tabletop and you're like well
16:07 [ __ ] what is this other stuff made out
16:08 of what we'll get to that in just a
16:11 second here first let's find out how
16:15 much co2 is in the greenhouse gas layer
16:17 because they're saying there's so much
16:18 it's a big ass problem right hmm but
16:24 really look like this much contribution
16:26 to the overall formula here let's find
16:29 out so it's one five hundred and
16:31 fortieth of a single percent all right
16:36 so we got to take this pin e1 pin E and
16:39 we got to cut it into 540 little pie
16:41 slices well Jesus it's not very big in
16:44 the first place by the time you get your
16:46 microscope the microscope out and you
16:48 get some I don't know some really
16:50 interesting equipment to try and create
16:52 a little pie slice of a penny that's
16:54 five hundred and fortieth of a pie
16:55 meaning we have to have 540 slices of
16:57 this penny all even so we can pull out
17:00 one little tiny invisible slice which is
17:06 the entire amount of co2 and the
17:09 greenhouse gas layer index but that's
17:12 the whole world's contribution to the
17:15 co2 gas layer it's not man's version
17:17 most of the co2 in the world comes from
17:20 rotting fish in the sea it comes from
17:23 volcanoes that just constantly burp all
17:26 of our you know excrement and and gas
17:30 passing from cows to human beings all
17:32 that stuff that's a little bit so that
17:36 little teeny slices everything that the
17:39 world contributes when a volcano erupts
17:41 you're talking about the amount of co2
17:43 going the air is astronomically huge you
17:46 can't stop it okay and it is way beyond
17:50 a single year's contribution of normal
17:52 co2 releasing so how much does man
17:57 contribute of this little teeny infinite
17:59 slice of a penny hmm well Al Gore is
18:03 insane [ __ ] lying puts it about 12%
18:07 that's the highest anyone's ever had the
18:11 balls to suggest
18:14 what do real scientists say hmm maybe
18:18 two and a half percent at the highest
18:22 hmm two and a half percent a 545 percent
18:28 of a whole 100 percent the way I like to
18:34 say it is if you had a big you know 100
18:37 inch 4k television or a k television I
18:40 don't care how many pixels you want to
18:42 put in that thing and I leave it black
18:46 but it's on and I turn on pixels and
18:50 that super hybrids monitor that
18:52 represent the amount of co2 that man
18:54 contributes you would have to get really
18:58 close to that monitor to find the pixel
19:02 maybe in a complete blackness of a
19:05 theater you might be able to find the
19:06 pixel because it's nothing man controls
19:11 nothing when it comes to the greenhouse
19:13 gas layer index so with that teeny tiny
19:17 bit of the penny what about all the
19:19 other chemicals that are up there well
19:23 they're about the same amount you're
19:26 still gonna have 99% of that first penny
19:28 that you've cut up left after you count
19:31 for all the other chemicals that are
19:33 known to be up there so what does all
19:36 the other copper made out of right we
19:37 what is the other 99.9% of the
19:40 greenhouse gas layer made out of it's
19:44 the evil thing called water okay how
19:49 many of you have been to a humid area in
19:51 the world
19:53 you talk about it mm-hmm was really
19:57 humid oh my god and you complained
19:59 nearly Jesus that was not comfortable
20:01 well why don't you like humidity well
20:03 just sticks to you and then all that
20:04 heat sticks to you and you just can
20:06 never get cool okay
20:10 but then you hear people that live in
20:11 deserts and the desert people say what
20:13 you say well how hot is it there because
20:17 my sisters in Houston at 88 degrees but
20:19 it's a hundred percent humidity so she's
20:21 dying what's happening in Lake Havasu
20:25 oh it's 114 the humidity is zero right
20:31 so 114 they're out there on a boat
20:35 chillin out drinking beer whatever
20:38 they're outside they're functional
20:40 because it's a dry heat so the the wind
20:44 comes by and it's hot but it doesn't
20:47 stick to you making you extra hot water
20:52 is the number one incubator of heat I
20:55 mean it I would say it captures it right
20:59 it's a beautiful substance we need it so
21:03 what is the big fear about co2 well Al
21:07 Gore lies his ass off you know I opened
21:12 up an episode of Maine on MK ULTRA radio
21:14 about global warming and I said it's not
21:16 the guy that told you the global warming
21:18 was real is the same guy that told you
21:21 he invented the internet kind of funny
21:24 right so his fake assertion and his big
21:28 lie that I know I I could only imagine
21:31 if there's a group of folks they're
21:32 gonna make trillions of dollars off this
21:34 they've done all the fake science for
21:36 him and handed it to him and all he does
21:38 is stand up there like a robot and do
21:41 his little speech he postulated and
21:46 suggested that he had proof okay
21:49 hopefully you see the contradiction and
21:51 irony of these statements that there was
21:54 a huge surge in co2 because of man and
21:57 then heat surge it surged after very
22:03 important that you know that that's his
22:04 claim co2 first
22:07 warmth second the reality is is that he
22:12 went first then co2 and second and why
22:16 is that well we've we've recorded that
22:19 in ice for hundreds of thousands of
22:22 years yes you have silly people in every
22:26 sector of climatology that will refute
22:29 at times ok depending on who you're
22:32 listening to what I'm about to tell you
22:33 but prior to global warming being a scam
22:39 against society to create carbon
22:40 taxation of which you know we're paying
22:43 it
22:43 it's insane America is paying it the
22:48 electric companies love it it's an extra
22:51 [ __ ] bunch of [ __ ] right if
22:54 anybody goes to jail at some point every
22:57 single executive in the world who's
22:59 contributed to collecting carbon
23:02 taxation should go to jail not for a
23:04 life it's just enough to send the
23:06 message you do that [ __ ] again
23:08 you know fingers are coming off next
23:10 time okay but the reason why heat comes
23:13 first and co2 comes second is that heat
23:18 we're talking infant testable amount of
23:20 degrees it's what makes life so the fish
23:26 procreate a lot more the trees procreate
23:29 a lot more we procreate a lot more and
23:32 then eventually fish start to die we
23:39 produce a lot more byproducts all living
23:41 beings do because there's more of us and
23:44 there's these infinitesimally mean
23:46 fractioning of a fraction of a fraction
23:47 of a percent increase and these levels
23:51 that we're talking about here right
23:53 there's a book out there called the
23:55 Almanac and it when I was a kid it was
23:59 held up as literally tome of an Oracle
24:02 because it's usually right and it is the
24:05 summation of some of the greatest
24:07 thinkers that go unnamed farmers and
24:12 just simple people that paid attention
24:13 to patterns wrote it into a book such
24:16 that when they need to
24:18 grow crops and rotate and no other
24:20 weather is going to behave there are
24:23 tons of patterns in the Almanac that
24:25 make predictions that are usually a
24:26 hundred percent correct well many of you
24:30 know but some of you don't that in the
24:32 1870s Europe and pretty much north the
24:36 northern hemisphere of the world
24:37 suffered from something called the mini
24:40 ice age there's a river in England
24:43 called the Thames I don't think I don't
24:46 think it freezes today if it does it's
24:49 very short-lived the Thames froze and
24:52 not just a little bit of ice on top it's
24:54 so thick several years in a row that
24:58 they actually had festivals on the ice
25:01 they did paintings and drawings of
25:03 people on the ice and then it warmed up
25:08 again and it all went away but that
25:10 cycle doesn't happen anymore it was a
25:13 freak thing well the Almanac spans
25:17 depending on how you parse the data up
25:20 to about three thousand years back they
25:21 keep adding and adding more information
25:23 as they find new records in China in
25:25 other parts of the world but this thing
25:29 that they saw happen in 1870s they
25:33 looked at the Almanac and said yeah this
25:34 seems to happen every hundred and fifty
25:35 years is called a mini ice age just uh
25:38 you know time when things fall below 32
25:41 degrees Fahrenheit zero degrees Celsius
25:42 and things freeze over well we are now
25:47 as I've told you several times I told
25:49 you way before this became a big press
25:51 issue because I learned from smart
25:53 people that we were going to be headed
25:55 for a mini ice age in 2020 now I don't
26:01 know what they thought they were doing
26:02 when they started calling it global
26:03 warming I think what they thought was
26:05 they could scare us into carbon taxation
26:07 and full approval very quickly and when
26:10 they didn't they realized oh [ __ ] we're
26:12 up against the mini ice ages coming so
26:14 let's change the name then change the
26:16 narrative from global warming to climate
26:18 change right well as much as I'd like
26:22 the world to be about seventy-five
26:24 degrees every single day maybe 78 it
26:28 changes so climate change is
26:31 like saying existence well of course
26:36 climate changes of course kind of idiot
26:39 are you if you think that that's a
26:40 [ __ ] profound statement in the first
26:41 place so that's where we're headed but
26:47 in this movie the great global warming
26:49 swindle you have a NASA scientist who
26:52 refers to what would occur if we had
26:55 something called global warming now what
26:58 you need to remember about this movie is
27:00 that in 2003 we had several sunspots and
27:04 when the Sun has sunspots we get heated
27:08 up here on earth extra just a little bit
27:10 extra I'll explain that a little bit
27:13 later I don't forget so when this movie
27:16 was made they refer back to a warming
27:19 cycle that occurred and they describe
27:21 generally the reason why there's nothing
27:25 to do with mankind okay but this
27:29 gentleman from NASA said look if you had
27:32 global warming we wouldn't have
27:34 hurricanes as much as we do we wouldn't
27:36 have tornadoes because that is a cold
27:38 front slamming against a warm front the
27:42 more globally warm we are both top and
27:45 bottom
27:45 meaning winter never really shows up
27:48 neither with all these hurricanes but
27:50 what's going on right now hurricanes are
27:53 off the [ __ ] chain aren't they crazy
27:55 you know I don't know what what the
27:57 deals with America we don't hear about
27:59 hurricanes hitting Europe or India or
28:01 Japan it just always hits the United
28:04 States it's like some really weird thing
28:06 man poor Cuba the Dominican Republic and
28:12 all these little Puerto Rico and all
28:13 those places out there they get
28:15 clobbered so global warming would calm
28:21 the world down that's not what we're
28:23 seeing so just remember that one so what
28:27 makes the world hot what is causing the
28:30 issue well there's a natural mechanism
28:33 that's that's happening which I'm going
28:35 to talk about the Sun and then there's
28:37 now this geoengineering [ __ ] that's
28:39 going on and we need to probably stand
28:44 up and
28:45 have some [ __ ] heads off okay because
28:47 we deserve to breathe clean air we do
28:50 man you can know off you can mess up all
28:53 the food at the grocery store and I can
28:54 buy it from someplace else you can
28:56 poison my water and I can put a filter
28:58 in it or not drink your [ __ ] but
29:00 when you [ __ ] with my air you're backing
29:04 us into a corner aren't you well get to
29:07 how they do that right after we cover
29:09 the Sun which I don't mean to surprise
29:12 anyone in the episode it's a thing that
29:15 makes us hot okay the Sun is a gigantic
29:19 plasma ball what is plasma well if you
29:24 need to think about it in the visual
29:25 terms it's a black ball of energy that
29:31 is moving so fast it's ether winds that
29:34 are moved I'm still moving at they're
29:36 close to 50 times the speed of light
29:38 velocity and they haven't slowed down to
29:41 orbit and become what we classify as
29:44 atomic energy but the sun's crust is
29:50 colliding with all of the matter of the
29:52 universe
29:52 plus other ether and so it is combusting
29:56 on the crust but the center of the Sun
29:58 believed in not is black it's black as
30:02 night because the stuff that's in there
30:04 hasn't decided what it's going to be
30:06 that's like a stem cell of electricity
30:08 if you will or stem cell of atomic
30:10 anything right atomic energy an atomic
30:13 matter exactly the same thing one is
30:15 moving slower and one is moving quicker
30:17 okay and it's all still related to the
30:20 style of movement right if you're an
30:22 electron then your style of movement is
30:25 never to be seen but if you're a would
30:28 particle you never know right someone
30:30 can carve you and do a little duck if
30:32 they want to but we have something
30:34 called sunspots how could there be a
30:37 spot on the Sun right you ever get spots
30:40 on your light bulbs that only happens
30:42 one way who the hell threw something on
30:45 the light bulb right you're blocking the
30:48 light that's coming from inside the
30:49 light bulb right
30:52 the surface of the Sun is millions and
30:55 millions of degrees the inside of the
30:57 Sun is probably zero zero Kelvin 360
31:01 degrees below zero Fahrenheit okay so
31:06 what happens is sometimes the surface of
31:09 the Sun starts to swirl and when that
31:15 happens it lets out this inner energy
31:19 which can become very volatile to us in
31:22 terms of friction because it's moving so
31:24 quickly it's like a little you know hose
31:27 spraying at you now the Sun rotates
31:29 right we watch this in all kinds of
31:32 films and at times you will see the if
31:37 you really look at some of these filters
31:39 that they put on the Sun the density of
31:41 the stuff swimming on the outside which
31:43 has been proven by the modern
31:44 cosmologists you study electrical the
31:46 electrical universe everything is
31:49 swimming on the surface of the Sun
31:51 exactly like electricity swims inside
31:54 those plasma balls and you can buy the
31:55 thrift store you put your finger on them
31:57 right there's a wormy nature to the way
32:00 electricity controls surfaces and that's
32:03 exactly what we see in the Sun at times
32:06 it looks like there's half of the Sun
32:09 that you can look directly into the
32:11 bowels of and there's nothing there
32:13 sometimes it looks like stars which I
32:16 love that line from 2010 Space Odyssey
32:18 oh my god it's full of stars which is
32:22 referencing Jupiter of course
32:24 so when sunspots occur which are fairly
32:28 cyclical they warm us up more sunspots
32:34 the more we get warm it's a little
32:35 temporary burst of warmth when they shut
32:38 up and don't show up then we get a
32:41 little cooler and that's the stage that
32:43 we're now so how could we be getting
32:47 warmer and have problems with our
32:51 climate if the Sun is sort of off it's
32:55 just in its normal mode
32:56 there's no sunspots per se
33:01 the answer to that is that they have
33:03 they we don't know exactly I don't know
33:07 if it's again your pace sewers or
33:12 whatever your families that are worried
33:15 about losing control of their empire
33:16 because there's too many of us and
33:19 eventually France ingo take it anymore
33:23 you know that kind of thing as it's been
33:26 described by people who have been deeply
33:27 involved with the project without even
33:29 knowing it
33:31 NASA yep NASA that Luciferian [ __ ]
33:39 group of liars right and I don't mean to
33:41 say every employee is that way I mean
33:43 you're talking about probably 99.9%
33:45 carry the nine quite a bit of the
33:47 employees are just nerds would think
33:49 that this [ __ ] is real they're they're
33:53 proof is not in the pudding half the
33:56 time right but there are NASA hangars
34:00 places where they keep planes and jets
34:02 on Air Force bases in the United States
34:04 of America and these planes are being
34:07 loaded up in these hangars with two key
34:11 chemicals at least two key chemicals one
34:15 is barium oxide which is a salt and one
34:18 is aluminum oxide which is basically
34:20 pulverized aluminum then these planes
34:22 are flying up into the air and they're
34:26 kicking out these gigantic white trails
34:29 now I've covered chemtrails a number of
34:33 times so if you have any doubts about
34:35 the validity of chemtrails
34:37 well right now they have now said that
34:40 they're going to be doing exactly what I
34:41 just told you so if you want to say that
34:43 I'm a [ __ ] tinfoil hat person I
34:45 suggest you read some of your liberal
34:47 news about how they're gonna turn on
34:49 this just happened last week this is
34:51 December of 2018 in the last week they
34:55 said they're going to be spraying this
34:57 [ __ ] in the sky to block the Sun to keep
35:01 us from getting too warm hmm well you
35:06 should know that once they start
35:07 spraying this stuff over us we all get
35:09 sick immediately the law of particulates
35:11 starts to have a problem
35:14 and we're not breathing pure oxygen for
35:16 breathing this crap
35:20 Russell Blaylock dr. Russell Blaylock
35:22 the retired neural surgeon has been
35:27 given samples that people have scraped
35:29 out of the sky with their private planes
35:31 and he has analyzed at an electron
35:33 microscope and he has confirmed that
35:35 this has been made in a laboratory
35:38 because it's nano sized particles
35:40 meaning you don't get natural particles
35:43 of aluminum at this tiny tiny level
35:48 he said that when you breathe this stuff
35:51 into your nose and here this is this is
35:54 his field of expertise the way that our
35:57 brain is sits inside of our skull is it
36:00 sits on top of the bone inside but the
36:02 bottom half of the brain has something
36:04 called the blood-brain barrier this is a
36:07 very coagulated layer of blood that is
36:11 designed to block us from ingesting
36:15 toxins into our bloodstream that get
36:17 into our brain because our brain is
36:19 obviously a fairly important little
36:20 mechanism to liaison with our soul right
36:24 but this stuff gets through right at the
36:28 apex of your nasal canal just draw a
36:30 line back about an inch from where the
36:33 bridge of your nose starts between your
36:35 eyeballs aces that will go straight into
36:37 your brain well aluminum in the brain
36:40 has been an age little problem that is
36:44 the cause of dementia and Alzheimer's
36:47 why because it accumulates in your brain
36:50 we got a huge surge in Alzheimer's about
36:54 10 years after we adopted aluminum cans
36:56 and aluminum this and aluminum net and
36:58 our cooking supplies my little hometown
37:00 again I've said this a couple times we
37:03 saw a first I saw my first Alzheimer's
37:06 patient in 1986 my physics teacher came
37:11 in and explained it to us explaining the
37:13 aluminum phenomenon he explained that
37:15 the elderly are starting not to use
37:17 aluminum products anymore because they
37:19 don't want to accumulate this [ __ ] and
37:20 go out with a perfectly healthy body but
37:23 a brain that's it's toast right so why
37:26 do they spray us with chemtrails
37:28 and we know that chemtrails are full of
37:30 a lot of other crap that literally is a
37:32 biological experiment with patented nano
37:35 systems in it using a piezo effect which
37:39 is essentially you ingest a crystal they
37:41 hit you with a beam of particular energy
37:44 and the crystal starts procreating these
37:47 tubules into your system which is then
37:50 recognized as Morgellons disease not a
37:53 real living creature but it behaves
37:55 enough like that to be called living
37:59 definitely something you shouldn't have
38:00 in your body okay but we'll just stick
38:04 with climate-related Kim trailing well
38:08 one I've seen chemtrails make storms too
38:11 I've seen Kim Charles earase storms
38:14 fascinating now my grandmother the one I
38:18 mentioned a previous episode that was
38:19 the teacher on her refrigerator for at
38:22 least a decade if not two she had this
38:24 clipping from 1955 where a bunch of
38:29 biplanes had flown over Kansas and
38:33 seeded a storm so she was a climate
38:38 change you know climate control
38:41 technology out of the 50s why she hit it
38:44 up there I can only imagine it's because
38:46 I'm been destined to bring you this
38:47 information I mean how bizarre is that
38:49 right why would a schoolteacher care
38:52 well today we know that China erased all
38:56 the storms off over the Olympics before
38:59 they hosted the Olympics causing a big
39:01 monsoon that killed like 1,700 people
39:03 down when we know that you can actually
39:06 hire folks for about $150,000 they'll
39:09 spray the sky over where your wedding is
39:12 and they'll race any storms to make sure
39:14 you have good weather so for anybody who
39:17 wants to deny that this [ __ ] exists well
39:19 they're just stupid
39:21 so should really really piss you off if
39:26 you're in any coastal region that's
39:29 getting hit by a hurricane and there's
39:32 no talk ever ever ever of erasing the
39:36 [ __ ] storm before it hits the coast
39:38 at least at least knocking it down
39:41 now someone might say oh but you're
39:43 talking about liability and government
39:44 hates liability and pah-pah-pah amen
39:47 okay we see satellite evidence that
39:52 they're juicing these babies up so let's
39:54 have some let's try it let's just try to
39:57 raise some of these storms right a whole
39:59 brigade of cargo jets jumping whatever
40:02 the [ __ ] they got to dump into these
40:03 things to get rid of it and they should
40:06 nip it in the bud when the thing is like
40:08 a little tiny tropical storm you know
40:11 you know I'm sure people can theorize
40:13 that you know you'll create um you know
40:15 a category ten and kill the entire world
40:18 I'm not convinced try it try it on a few
40:22 benign ones out in the Pacific you know
40:24 but there is a gentleman his last name
40:27 escapes you his name is Dane he is
40:29 notorious if you look up chemtrails Dane
40:32 you're gonna find his name I'm still
40:36 like on the fence about this guy but he
40:40 has demonstrated that the amount of Kim
40:45 trailing up by the polar ice caps I
40:50 don't know about the solar other sorry
40:52 the southern Antarctica caps I you know
40:55 they never seem to mention that at all
40:57 isn't a little weird but the northern Qi
41:01 device that's up there we're gonna talk
41:03 about glaciers here in a second it's
41:06 like they're adjusting the Jetstream by
41:10 adjusting where the moisture and the
41:12 heat is using these planes and it's
41:15 fairly resilient right the jet stream
41:17 likes to hold in a position it's got a
41:20 lot of a nurse show let's just put that
41:22 way it likes to stay where it is okay
41:26 well Danes done some pretty damn good
41:29 research he's got a PhD I believe you
41:31 contributed to the creation of solar
41:33 panels back in the day that's one of his
41:34 hoorah moments I believe he owes over
41:37 3,000 acres of land up against Mount
41:40 Shasta they've gone up into Mount Shasta
41:42 and taken samples of snow because it's a
41:44 great way to see what's in the
41:46 atmosphere because they're seeing a ton
41:48 of trails over his land he says it's 65
41:50 times over the legal limit of aluminum
41:53 oxide
41:55 in the snow then that snow melts and
41:57 becomes water that's insult to you the
42:01 crops all over his land are dying he
42:04 employs several PhD level botanists who
42:07 take care of his land when they try to
42:10 figure out what the hell was wrong with
42:12 his land and there's a bunch of people
42:13 complaining about this around the world
42:16 they did the pH balance measurement of
42:19 the soil below the plants and they found
42:22 out what should be negative 6 in the
42:26 acidity level of the soil the nitrate
42:29 levels it's almost alkaline zero well
42:33 you need negative six what makes it go
42:36 alkaline ah aluminum I think I told you
42:40 guys that my little hometown is
42:41 converted to GMO as my buddy told me who
42:46 lives right next to these farmers I mean
42:48 out his backyard is a bunch of slave
42:50 fields he said for four years they had
42:53 horrible crops the Monsanto moved in and
42:56 sold them an aluminum resistant seed and
42:59 goddamn it if they didn't just grow the
43:01 best crop ever and I was back from my
43:04 reunion and I watched them just painting
43:07 the sky with these trails and this is a
43:10 little hometown a hundred miles from any
43:12 major airport in the country okay
43:16 there's no reason for a big jet to be
43:18 flowing up flying over my hometown where
43:21 you could read you know the side of it
43:23 is you're 100 miles away from any
43:25 approach at that point when I was a kid
43:29 seeing a plane
43:30 singing jet excuse me was a very big
43:33 deal because they were so rare and yeah
43:36 I'm sure they've increased the overall
43:38 population of jets in the sky I don't
43:40 know why because the Jets can hold a lot
43:41 more people these days but let's just
43:43 say that occurred this was insane these
43:45 things were painting white lines over
43:47 and over and over so I believe with
43:51 Danes information and my hometown farmer
43:54 information it's the same exact story
43:56 aluminum resistant seeds was there big
43:58 aluminum epidemic going on here but what
44:03 Dane demonstrated in several of his
44:05 presentations is that they have sprayed
44:08 on
44:08 top of the jet stream such the jet
44:11 stream moves over and when they realized
44:14 they could do that they started
44:15 controlling where this thing went
44:17 now do the elite of the world want us to
44:20 have a full-blown Ice Age if those
44:22 things even exist probably not right
44:25 because they own land and they live in
44:26 this world to all they want to do in my
44:29 opinion is melt the caps enough that we
44:33 can pass some photographs around and
44:34 scare everyone into carbon taxation and
44:36 as soon as all of it's signed they stop
44:40 [ __ ] with the weather ice caps go
44:43 back and they claim victory to the
44:46 people that they solve the problem and
44:49 they created the problem in the first
44:50 place didn't they now anyone who's
44:54 interested in the hoax of global warming
44:58 you've probably already realized that
45:01 for the average person who is again they
45:04 have no purpose in life according to
45:06 their own definition they do but they
45:08 haven't found they haven't found it yet
45:10 so they're usurping Al Gore's [ __ ]
45:13 story and run him with it because it
45:16 gives them a purpose you know these
45:17 people you know these [ __ ] people
45:19 it's like they're the they're the people
45:21 at every three or four years they tell
45:23 you that they're taking this supplement
45:25 and you should take the supplement and
45:27 there's this way you should live your
45:28 life because they're living that way
45:29 before years later they don't own a
45:31 bottle that's [ __ ] in their house and
45:32 run to the next dependency you know
45:36 horribly ignorant human beings
45:37 unfortunately as their designation but
45:41 they'll tell you that there's a bunch of
45:42 scientists there's conclusive proof well
45:44 there's a billion articles online
45:46 everybody who knows anything about
45:47 climate is on board with Al Gore you're
45:50 the idiot mm-hmm what you'll find is at
45:54 the Middle Ages were they experienced a
45:58 several years over a hundred years of
46:01 heat that is way beyond where we are
46:04 today and the world flourished so if
46:08 you're a scientist and you want to get
46:10 money how you do it well you don't have
46:13 a job do you usually don't have a job
46:17 this you're in a private Institute
46:18 funded by some crazy billionaire or
46:20 somehow you're kicking out a product
46:22 people buy which is very rare you got to
46:25 get grants and loans you're begging your
46:28 whole life you're a serf your whole life
46:31 because you won't get out there and get
46:33 a [ __ ] real job make a product okay
46:36 well when you have to beg what are you
46:40 doing and you got a big brown stain
46:42 around your face don't check because
46:44 you've been brown those and like crazy
46:47 when the when the word went out that if
46:51 you're struggling for funding and I mean
46:52 you want to make a documentary film you
46:54 want to be a scientist splitting atoms
46:56 or whatever if you can write a thesis or
46:59 a pitch a grant proposal and put global
47:03 warming in there and Express how much
47:05 you're willing to [ __ ] take whatever
47:07 you do with that money and then have at
47:09 least a byproduct off to the side that
47:11 says the global warming is real you got
47:14 mass massive infinite funding because
47:16 you're helping them now what's really
47:19 funny is the second that they contribute
47:23 to the overall non stop taxation meaning
47:27 it can't be reversed any more because
47:28 it's all been signed up the [ __ ] and
47:30 doctrine ation machine starts up the
47:34 people that were funding those
47:35 scientists those piece of [ __ ] people
47:39 that will sell their own [ __ ] world
47:41 out to make a buck they're clipped
47:45 immediately there's no more funding you
47:48 just gave us what we needed you dumb
47:50 [ __ ] and now we're gonna take all the
47:53 money and keep it to ourselves
47:55 you'll never see anything your family
47:57 will die under taxation you think we're
48:01 gonna let you procreate you're nuts you
48:05 backstabbed your own people that's
48:07 something we reserved only for ourselves
48:08 the ruling class say remember the movie
48:12 The Matrix 1999 there's a little Guido
48:16 guy from risky business and you know
48:21 Neil pops out a little thing and they
48:24 clean him all up and they teach him
48:25 about the matrix and he's totally into
48:26 it and then you know was it Morpheus you
48:31 know played by Laurence Fishburne
48:32 teaches him how to do all the superhero
48:35 moves and
48:35 just about to win they're just about to
48:38 win in this Guido [ __ ] beautifully
48:41 played by that actor by the way he [ __ ]
48:43 him all over right
48:44 he sells out the whole bunch tells him
48:46 tells the you know that was a mr.
48:49 Smith's where everything's gonna be so
48:51 he can get back into the matrix because
48:52 he hates living inside that that ship
48:55 it's such a brilliant twist because it
48:57 does make sense that someone would go I
48:59 don't want to be out here in this crappy
49:00 world I love the matrix well every
49:05 single scientist on planet earth that
49:07 takes money anybody not just a scientist
49:11 a movie director whether it be a little
49:15 Schmo that makes a documentary you never
49:16 see or someone like that the Pacific Rim
49:21 guy who injects global warming into let
49:23 allows global warming to be injected
49:25 into a script he has no choice if he
49:27 wants to make a movie he's gotta let him
49:30 revise the script there Guido against
49:34 humanity the whole lot the whole planet
49:37 right now it's gonna be really hard for
49:39 them to counteract the mini ice age
49:43 that's going to do what it's going to do
49:45 and there's going to be very little man
49:47 can do to stop it
49:49 save making a volcano explode you know
49:54 formalizing the entire Amada of jets
49:56 that have been spraying us for god knows
49:58 how long but at least since the late 90s
50:00 you know a lot of people have a problem
50:03 believing that the chemtrails are real
50:04 or that they're at all dangerous because
50:06 that was a Jesse Ventura and his chilly
50:10 little fake conspiracy show the guy sold
50:15 out man the guys completely sold up I
50:17 think he's crazy too but he's completely
50:19 sold out at this point he said well you
50:22 know the stuff spraying over Washington
50:23 DC so why would these senators allow
50:26 themselves to get sprayed if it's so
50:28 deadly I don't think it's deadly I think
50:32 it just makes you sick in terms of
50:35 losing your mind well do you really
50:37 think Maxine Waters as more than maybe
50:41 one functioning synapse between her ears
50:44 I don't think so and I think a bunch of
50:47 them are exactly the same
50:50 hopefully with the changes that are
50:52 happening in the Great Awakening at some
50:54 point we need the United States military
50:57 where these bases are to just do the job
51:01 kicking NASA's ass by using the moon
51:04 hoax is probably the best way to
51:07 reappropriation get them to move right
51:10 if NASA hangers get shut down because
51:12 NASA gets exposed for being a fraud
51:14 which you know I'm gonna breathe deeply
51:16 until that happens those hangars have
51:18 got to shut down any one of you and
51:21 military or taking it taking you know
51:23 inventory of things coming in to bases
51:25 and going out of bases where these NASA
51:27 hangars are that's how the first woman
51:28 figured out what was going on she knew
51:31 it was very mach side she knew it was
51:32 aluminum oxide but when she asked them
51:34 where the hell are you coming from and
51:36 who are you they said oh no no we work
51:38 for NASA or aerospace you can't ask us
51:42 any questions about who we are
51:44 hmm lovely right but now let's let's
51:50 look at it from their perspective I'm
51:54 gonna remind you you guys who are
51:56 hardcore listeners have heard this
51:57 before
51:57 I apologize for saying that all the time
51:59 for the new listeners you gotta
52:01 understand I don't want them to think
52:02 that I've sniffed too much aluminum good
52:06 friend of mine who remains nameless he's
52:11 an expert in energy not scientists but
52:16 you know he's like any of us if we
52:19 devoted last 10 years of our life to a
52:20 particular subject matter you get to
52:21 become a bit of an expert and he's so
52:24 much of an expert at it that he was
52:25 invited to speak at a function and in
52:30 the room is a Rothschild the young son
52:34 that goes around and claims that Mars
52:36 comes before earth which I've heard a
52:40 couple times it's really strange how
52:42 that weird mistake gets repeated was the
52:45 Mandela effect or something out
52:46 something we don't know right but he was
52:51 in there to talk about electric cars so
52:55 he begins his presentation he is
52:59 surrounded I think he said in like a
53:00 horseshoe
53:02 Able's he's given the presentation very
53:04 small group of super elite people he was
53:08 no more than ten minutes into his
53:09 presentation before the rotschild kid
53:10 said you know what I don't know why
53:11 we're talking about electric cars I give
53:13 a [ __ ] about your cars well we really
53:15 need to be strategizing in this room is
53:17 depopulation because the world's getting
53:19 too [ __ ] populated and then everyone
53:22 in a hurry to cover their face and brown
53:29 stuff jumps into the conversation and he
53:32 loses his presentation completely he
53:34 said they then spent the next several
53:36 hours talking about nothing but
53:37 depopulation so what are the theories of
53:40 depopulation I mean what to do about it
53:42 right cuz it's happening I mean we're
53:44 getting overpopulated by some countries
53:47 overpopulation always has to do with IQ
53:51 level of the human beings that are doing
53:52 it soon as you get a high IQ you slow
53:56 down yeah low IQ you [ __ ] like bunnies
53:59 because you can't think of anything else
54:00 to do or be it's a cultural thing some
54:03 [ __ ] culture thing why people used
54:05 to do it right every sperm is sacred
54:07 remember that other meaning of life
54:08 right so they've done the math and they
54:12 said this is an exponential curve and
54:14 they are right 100% right they said well
54:17 in a hundred years it's going to get so
54:19 [ __ ] out of control that we're gonna
54:21 have to get draconian on humanity and
54:24 literally pick people and kill them or
54:27 create some logan's run world where at
54:28 30 you're dead hmm all right so that is
54:33 a problem so their ideas to say look man
54:36 yeah Al Gore's a dick nobody likes him
54:39 nobody likes him in the entire world
54:42 there's not a single person that likes
54:43 the guy especially it was masseuses that
54:45 he chases around in his robe but you
54:49 know so he gets rich he's formed blood
54:51 and gore that's a company name of his he
54:53 also has the the Chicago climate
54:56 exchange CCX
54:57 it's gonna deal in climate exchange
54:59 stocks and so I've actually had an
55:02 [ __ ] telling me this at a party
55:04 un-fuckin'-believable guys a complete
55:06 [ __ ] it kisses up to everyone who will
55:08 keep his pho status in check but his
55:12 thing is about well this guy didn't know
55:14 anything about the
55:15 the taxation against population but
55:16 these elitists will say much people will
55:20 get rich because they do on every one of
55:22 these sort of paradigms that we invent
55:23 fine but we have to stop this this
55:28 overpopulation of the world okay but
55:33 there's a problem with the theory that
55:35 carbon taxation is we're going to take
55:37 care of depopulation there's two well
55:40 there's at least two regions of the
55:42 world that are out of [ __ ] control to
55:44 population China and India I have
55:48 nothing against Chinese people I have
55:49 nothing against Indian people know I
55:51 love their food I love their culture as
55:53 much as I know about it right but
55:56 they're unable to stop the
55:58 overpopulation in these areas they are
56:01 exempt from all global carbon taxation
56:06 they're exempt from the Kyoto agreement
56:09 which was to instantiate environmental
56:13 controls to reduce the carbon footprint
56:15 around the world well then we haven't
56:19 solved the problem have we we've only
56:21 given the advantage to two groups of
56:23 people that are [ __ ] out of control
56:26 right so the whole thing falls on its
56:30 face America doesn't need to depopulate
56:33 Europe definitely doesn't need to
56:36 depopulate Europe is depopulating by
56:38 design now at the same time some people
56:43 if you try to bring this up some people
56:44 get in your face and they will you know
56:47 get smug with you and of course when
56:49 they're starting to lose the argument
56:50 and it's like you backed them into a
56:52 corner but it's kind of funny you back
56:54 them into an intellectual corner of
56:56 which they have no intellectual capacity
56:58 in there and so the faroe crap they
57:00 throw at you just sounds more and more
57:01 insane as time goes on but they'll say
57:06 oh so I think so you think oil is the
57:08 best thing you think that we should all
57:09 be you know have gigantic carbon
57:12 footprints no one's hip to the
57:14 depopulation things you rarely ever hear
57:16 anything about that the answer is no so
57:21 usually what I get into a debate with
57:22 someone I can see they're kind of
57:24 frothing and they're looking to be right
57:25 they're gonna they know they're gonna
57:26 slam-dunk me with Al Gore's
57:28 no portfolio of the most ignorant
57:32 ignorant things any human being has ever
57:33 said I say look okay right off the bat I
57:37 believe in a zero-point energy system I
57:40 believe we have probably hundreds
57:42 hundreds of designs for these things
57:44 that just simply been bought off and
57:46 patented and then put on a shelf or they
57:49 killed the people that knew how to do
57:50 these things and so I believe in
57:53 zero-point energy systems I don't
57:55 believe in any substance being taken out
57:58 of the soil of the of the earth and
58:01 burned I don't believe in fission
58:04 reaction nuclear power plants either I
58:07 also want my air to be as clean as
58:09 possible save the sweet smoke from a
58:12 nice punch cigar yeah I don't want to
58:15 see a factory bar fan out a bunch of
58:17 black smoke I don't want to see a car
58:19 choking me to death because it runs on
58:21 some [ __ ] 1995 diesel engine I don't
58:25 want any of that to occur but I also
58:27 don't want my kids kids kids running
58:30 into this carbon taxation problem and if
58:32 they have a bad economy at one point
58:34 because it's engineered by these
58:35 oligarchy [ __ ] okay then no one can
58:39 afford to procreate and the bloodlines
58:42 end our only hope is that our bloodlines
58:46 continue to go and what we have learned
58:48 get synaptically passed down through
58:50 genetics and they take care of their
58:52 mind and they keep the keep the
58:54 challenges on their psyche and they
58:56 evolve into the next super species of
58:59 mankind right but what about power hmm
59:04 didn't we solve this problem of coal
59:07 burning power plants versus oil burning
59:09 power plants versus fission nuclear
59:12 power plants some of you might be saying
59:15 well yeah solar panels and wind farms
59:17 okay let me give you a big big secret
59:20 there the reason why you're allowed to
59:22 have solar panels and wind farms is
59:26 because it's a shitty way of creating
59:27 electricity hey it's better than some of
59:31 the alternatives and sometimes you can
59:32 put one of those windmills in a really
59:35 nice place on a farm and it totally
59:36 takes care for the takes care of the
59:38 farm that's cool but big giant wind
59:40 farms
59:42 me a break we don't need any of this
59:43 [ __ ] not one of them you don't need any
59:46 solar panels you don't need any freaking
59:48 windmills what do you need well outside
59:51 of hydroelectric which is pretty awesome
59:52 of which America refuses to build
59:56 anymore right we're buying cheap energy
59:58 clean energy from Canada because they're
60:00 not idiots right but the oil companies
60:03 and electrical companies refuse hydrogen
60:07 hydroelectric dams and plants to be
60:10 built whether something called the
60:13 geothermal plant those of you who've
60:17 done some research in it and still
60:19 believe in global warming you might
60:20 believe that they are too toxic to
60:23 operate so what does the geothermal
60:25 design come from and I'm going to share
60:28 with you the information I got from an
60:31 older gentleman who was who believes in
60:35 climate change
60:36 believe it or not but he told me a very
60:38 interesting story about these geothermal
60:40 planes and you see this covered in I
60:43 believe the initial zeitgeist movie to
60:47 give you a perspective of a well
60:48 operating geothermal planet built
60:50 correctly which we're going to get into
60:52 here one geothermal plant provides as
60:56 estimated in the zeitgeist movie again I
60:59 haven't done the numbers I don't even
61:01 know how I would do these numbers but it
61:04 provides 4,500 times the amount of
61:07 energy that the world needs just with
61:09 one we repeat that so if you said a
61:13 hundred percent is all the energy you
61:15 need on a particular day according to
61:18 some of the calculations one highly
61:22 functional geothermal plant can provide
61:25 4,500 times what we need on a daily
61:29 basis so take one unit that's all we
61:32 need multiply times 4,500 that's a lot
61:36 of energy right so what is this thing as
61:39 I've had it communicated to me in the
61:41 1950s when the nuclear duck-and-cover
61:45 era was hitting us when everyone was
61:47 worried about these nuclear bombs going
61:48 off around a particular region thus
61:51 hobbling the electrical grid the United
61:55 States Mint
61:56 Terry commissioned Caltech the probably
62:00 the top university in the planet in
62:01 Pasadena California to come up with a
62:05 design of a plant that needed really no
62:07 fuel no oil no coal no nuclear fission
62:12 simply relied on things that already
62:14 exist in the world to metabolize heat I
62:16 can you know you have hydroelectric
62:21 which is you have a dam of water falling
62:23 over a cliff and you make them hit
62:25 turbines and the turbines using AC
62:27 current mechanisms rotate and create
62:31 electricity okay great
62:33 pretty sure it's AC once we figured out
62:37 how to turn a turbine we're like okay
62:38 what else turns a turbine
62:39 when turns a turbine that's what that
62:42 thing is it's just same sort of little
62:44 turbine engine but it's up there using a
62:46 wooden wheel to turn it okay so
62:50 geothermal said now heat is the key heat
62:53 boils water boiling water turns turbines
62:55 where is there heat in the in the world
62:58 naturally hmm well solar panels are a
63:02 completely different technology uses the
63:04 friction of the sunlight to create the
63:06 the stimulated balance of electricity
63:09 around a conductive surface but it's
63:12 really inefficient they're getting
63:13 better but they're still [ __ ] which is
63:15 why we're allowed to buy them but they
63:19 realize there's something called
63:20 volcanoes hmm now there's volcanoes that
63:24 have popped and they have a big top like
63:26 your kid draws them or you make the you
63:28 know vinegar and baking soda thing for
63:31 grade school but there's a lot of these
63:36 Vince that haven't popped ever and
63:38 they're not gonna pop for a really long
63:40 time but they still have you know magma
63:44 coming up to the edge of the crust of
63:46 the earth and we can drill down to them
63:49 and put tubes down there with water in
63:53 it use a natural heat in the rock way
63:56 before we get to liquid magma right lava
64:01 the rocks that hold the place together
64:03 are really hot they're so hot that when
64:06 you touch it with water it boils
64:08 immediately
64:09 so Caltech did this brilliant design of
64:12 a geothermal plant tap and to evade
64:15 normal heat of the crust of the earth
64:17 and boil water turned turbines
64:20 clean as a whistle you're great but if
64:23 you go look out geothermal plants and
64:24 their drawbacks because there's several
64:27 of them in existence they're
64:28 experimenting with them they built them
64:31 simply to prove to the people that they
64:32 can't be used but not really trying to
64:34 make it work now I'm going to give you
64:37 an analogy that are given another
64:38 episodes but if you're brand new here we
64:40 go
64:41 how many of you seen a test tube it's
64:44 been boiled to create a chemical
64:47 reaction
64:47 you're breaking bad moment right well
64:51 how's that work you get a tube that goes
64:54 down and it comes back up and it's got a
64:57 closed bottom to it right because if you
65:00 left the bottom open what would happen
65:02 whatever you put in would fall out okay
65:05 or if something was toxic at the bottom
65:07 it would come up so again as I've had it
65:11 communicated to me the original
65:13 schematics of a geothermal plant ran big
65:16 giant pipes down to this mantle that's
65:18 really hot and either was capped or it
65:21 turned right back around and came back
65:22 up but it was always sealed like when
65:25 you look underneath your sink you see
65:26 that you know drain pipe that goes and
65:27 does a little S curve right well same
65:29 thing but it came all the way back up to
65:31 the top you put clean water down in
65:34 there that's not hot it boils it comes
65:37 back up super steamy turns a turbine you
65:39 could put the turbine anywhere in the
65:40 pipe where it's the sweet spot infinite
65:43 electricity all day long the only thing
65:45 you have to do is build a good turbine
65:47 to make sure that if it runs 24 hours a
65:49 day it's not gonna suddenly explode
65:51 right but what have they done they put
65:55 the pipes down there with open ends now
65:59 they're bringing up all the heat but
66:00 they're also bringing up so Furyk acid
66:02 had a bunch of other toxic stuff that's
66:04 down there we're all this you know
66:07 primal use exists now they're saying to
66:11 you well we can't build geothermal
66:13 plants after all at any level of
66:15 capacity because to clean up the
66:18 chemicals that come up is so costly we
66:20 lose money
66:21 oh god guys look like you're gonna have
66:23 to continue burning fossil fuels hahaha
66:27 right so there is a lot of concern that
66:31 the administration that's in the White
66:33 House right now is not buying into all
66:35 this [ __ ] you need to understand the
66:38 balls it takes to go against all this
66:42 lunacy around the world with this
66:44 ridiculous easily debunked bunch of crap
66:48 about how much co2 is in a greenhouse
66:50 gas layer index there is much there is
66:53 as much percentage-wise co2 in the
66:56 greenhouse gas layer index as there is
66:58 oxygen on the surface of the Sun there's
67:02 a little bit I guess so how do we handle
67:06 the depopulation problem without getting
67:08 draconian do we look the other way until
67:10 there's a big problem and then we seem
67:12 like the idiots obviously not right the
67:16 rule can probably contain several
67:19 billion more people without having a jug
67:22 any problem now certain countries are
67:23 gonna go tits up quicker but China is
67:26 largely uninhabited
67:28 it's the eastern coast where Beijing and
67:32 Shanghai are that has the super duper
67:34 dense population but you start going
67:35 west it's beautiful it's like it's like
67:38 the Midwest of the United States of
67:40 America
67:41 Mongolia all these just gorgeous
67:43 landscapes so they have barely started
67:45 to build in the 2/3 majority of their
67:48 western region of that country India I
67:52 am a little bit less informed about
67:54 exactly the density so not quite sure
67:58 exactly what their plans are but what is
68:02 the number one thing that slows down
68:03 population and makes people happy at the
68:05 same exact time education what kind of
68:10 education education about population
68:11 control well that may not hurt to pass
68:15 that around a little bit but I say the
68:18 best thing in the world to slow down
68:20 population and this is no mystery this
68:22 is not my invention his destiny you give
68:26 a person destiny and they start to think
68:30 different
68:31 about whether or not they want to live
68:33 their whole life I mean their whole life
68:35 having 20 kids right
68:37 you know decade after decade of having
68:41 new children taking care of them and
68:43 never having a life of their own now I
68:47 will say that it can happen so quickly
68:51 that meaning destiny you teach someone
68:53 about destiny it could be that they
68:55 never have any children okay but how
68:58 does population ramp up and I got a
69:01 whole episode on depopulation I'm just
69:02 going to give you the cliff notes right
69:03 here because I think it's important the
69:07 you know yet takes a man and a woman
69:10 sorry about all you other 71 genders or
69:13 whatever it is yeah 71 goes there 73
69:16 right knee you so it takes a fully
69:19 functional heterosexual male and female
69:21 to be interested in having copy it you
69:24 know copulating having sex if they have
69:27 one child
69:27 they've depopulated by one because ii
69:30 made one that's what my parents did
69:33 aren't they activists i tell you what
69:35 well if you have two kids then you're
69:37 just maintaining population right mom
69:39 dad gave two that are counted four and
69:42 that's if they live a full life right
69:44 once you have three you've added one
69:46 everything over to your adding now
69:50 against some regions of the world need
69:51 to [ __ ] like bunnies they do France
69:55 their population is supposedly reducing
69:58 an alarming rate most of Europe is
70:00 reducing at an alarming rate so I would
70:02 say that region of the world could stand
70:05 making three kids at least two but
70:09 probably three kids for the next several
70:11 hundred years is to repopulate to the
70:13 levels that they were at maybe 100 years
70:15 ago America well we have some definite
70:20 densely populated areas I think that 350
70:24 million is pretty good for us two per
70:27 family is pretty good and that's what
70:31 climate change is all about that's what
70:33 the carbon taxation is all about you'll
70:35 have enough carbon credits to have one
70:36 child well thank you
70:40 thank you ruling class but unless you're
70:45 wealthy the carbon taxation is going to
70:47 run out on your second kid you kind of
70:50 be able to have it but in terms of
70:52 paying for it you're gonna always be out
70:53 of pocket if they get their way which
70:55 they haven't gotten their way completely
70:56 when it comes to the utility bills that
70:58 you would use for for people living in a
71:01 house land of course when your kids a
71:03 baby and they're taking a bath in the
71:05 frickin kitchen sink right but as soon
71:07 as they start butchering become about 10
71:09 years old start consuming a average
71:11 amount of food taking an average amount
71:14 of showers using an average amount of
71:15 electricity now they start to become
71:18 visible on the radar of this climate
71:22 taxation third kid you're gonna need to
71:25 be rich you're gonna need to be rich
71:28 because no no allocation will be left at
71:32 all even a child even just running bath
71:35 water and a sink will be registerable in
71:38 your bank account your penalties right
71:41 because it's not only going to be you
71:43 know what's gonna happen is this the
71:46 reason why there's a Chicago climate
71:48 exchange the CCX founded by Al Gore and
71:52 some other folks is that let's say I
71:55 don't want to have any kids ever well I
71:58 have an allocation that's very easy for
72:01 about a kid and a half so I have been
72:04 allocated credits to my person well
72:08 you're a family that wants to have a
72:09 second child so you need a way to buy
72:13 credits so you go to the stock exchange
72:15 and you buy my credits from me every
72:19 month I don't know how it works really
72:21 but you get to have that other kit
72:23 you're still paying for it because if
72:26 you don't have the tax credits then you
72:28 get a penalty and how do we know
72:30 penalties ramp up right if you drive in
72:33 LA and you drive in the fast track Lane
72:35 and you forget to call in or use the
72:37 website to pay for your little five
72:40 dollar charge it'll be 50 bucks to 100
72:43 bucks in a month and a half [ __ ]
72:45 complete completely illegal [ __ ] if you
72:48 ran a small business and charged that
72:49 much interest for anyone that walked
72:52 into your store and didn't pay the bill
72:53 they put you in jail but there let the
72:56 other person sue you not the state of
72:58 California it's important that we have
73:01 the real conversations isn't it if we
73:04 could never have the real conversation
73:05 about what's really wrong then we're
73:07 never gonna solve any problems if the
73:11 concern is population control then
73:13 that's the cassettes the conversation we
73:15 need to have because there's not going
73:19 to be much of a difference between the
73:20 draconian control of population which is
73:23 just basically hauling our old people
73:25 and killing them or you know you had too
73:27 many kids in your house and they just
73:29 kill the baby right one they figure out
73:30 it exists and this world where you can
73:34 have kids and it's right in your face
73:36 and you're being repressed with this
73:39 carbon taxation we need to have
73:42 philosophies that we accept as human
73:46 beings there's been countless errors in
73:49 man's history where they over harvest
73:52 the area where they live right they cut
73:54 down all the trees and all of a sudden
73:56 they all die because the trees were
73:58 producing fruit and vegetables and
74:00 whatever they turn the land too much and
74:03 it can't grow anything this has happened
74:05 over and over and over again
74:07 these are things we need to teach
74:10 religions that say that every sperm is
74:12 sacred yeah we got to cut off fiction at
74:16 the beginning right so for those of you
74:18 hang on to these ancient human religions
74:21 which are based on you know the morals
74:23 are based on really good allegory but
74:27 this idea that you should procreate
74:30 constantly because that's what God wants
74:32 well that was just invented so that one
74:34 particular region of the world could
74:35 dominate another particular region of
74:36 the world right so it had its use at
74:40 time since how Europe came into
74:42 existence every sperm was sacred up
74:45 until the point of the fall of the
74:46 Catholic Church and then you could wear
74:48 condom if you were a different religion
74:51 I said we're gonna talk about the ice
74:53 caps
74:54 so wherever there's ice and again the
74:58 North Pole has no big continent up there
75:00 with the South Pole does that's why we
75:02 get all of our information from regions
75:04 that are like that
75:06 but we have report after report that
75:09 they're melting off at alarming rates
75:10 and at the same exact time from
75:12 different scientific communities very
75:14 legit sources they say the ice caps are
75:16 getting bigger than they've ever been in
75:17 the world they've growing faster they've
75:19 ever grown then you'll see those
75:21 pictures online which are just like
75:24 little memes right from this group so
75:28 it's hard to sift out who's telling the
75:29 truth and who isn't you'll see these
75:31 videos for all those those ice shelves
75:33 keep falling into the ocean that people
75:35 just crying in their beers you know
75:37 whatever at night ice forms on one end
75:43 and falls into the ocean on the other
75:45 end because it's a migratory object okay
75:48 so if you want to film part of the ice
75:52 that is falling into the ocean and then
75:55 narrate that in a way that it says
75:57 global warming is real look you got to
76:01 go to the other side and watch it freeze
76:03 but you can't see freezing right
76:06 freezing happens slowly over time
76:07 whereas the thing that falls off is a
76:09 big action-packed movie so it's easy to
76:12 manipulate the minds of people by
76:15 filming one side of an ice cap and not
76:19 the other side Mother Earth is an
76:21 amazing amazing being she will always
76:25 recover she will always make it right
76:30 can mankind destroy the world well of
76:32 course but mainly destroy it in a way
76:35 that we can't survive not in a way that
76:37 the earth won't survive there it's just
76:40 like yeah whatever you're a barely a
76:42 fungus that I allow to live on my
76:45 surface right we don't need our air
76:48 polluted we don't need scientists that
76:51 haven't consulted with us the majority
76:52 of the world that 99.9 percent of the
76:54 planet to say we're gonna block your Sun
76:58 big newsflash you're made of Sun you're
77:02 made of ether a particles you're made of
77:04 what comes out of the universe and hits
77:06 you you're constantly renewing construct
77:09 I mean it's like you're just the
77:14 classification of the swirl in the water
77:16 like I always say look when I point at a
77:19 currant and water I say what's that and
77:21 you have two choices in your answer you
77:23 can say that's a currant it's a spinning
77:25 vortex of water like the one in your
77:28 sink the one in your bathtub the one in
77:29 your toilet and I can be an [ __ ] and
77:32 go no it's actually just water yeah but
77:34 it's spinning in that way so that's why
77:36 we call it this other thing it's like
77:37 you're spinning in a way that's why I
77:39 call you human being this Mike is
77:41 spinning in a way that's why I call it a
77:43 Mike if you cut off what this stuff is
77:46 made of your pituitary gland won't make
77:49 vitamin D and vitamin D is in every
77:52 recipe of keeping a humanity healthy you
77:57 take vitamin D out doesn't matter how
77:59 much other crap you put in there you're
78:00 getting sick that's why Russians and
78:03 anyone who lives north the northern half
78:06 of the northern hemisphere they take
78:08 kids and putting them in front of
78:09 tanning machines to stimulate the
78:11 pituitary gland to give them vitamin D
78:13 because you can't take a supplement they
78:15 make the supplement but if you take it
78:17 you're kidding yourself you got to get
78:18 your ass out in front of the Sun one
78:20 hour a day on your face that's the way
78:22 to keep really healthy that's why those
78:24 beach combers are really healthy that's
78:26 why I see tons of homeless people but I
78:28 never see them wiping their nose cuz
78:30 they're sick it's interesting I'm sure
78:33 they do get sick but I'm just saying and
78:35 the beach we have a lot of people that
78:37 if you're gonna be homeless want to be
78:38 homeless on the beach right they're just
78:42 hungry they're a little crazy because
78:45 anyone to talk to they seem pretty
78:47 healthy pretty rugged
78:49 there's a guy in India says he hasn't
78:51 eaten food and like what 30 years or
78:52 something he just sits in the Sun all
78:55 day hmm
78:57 who knows if he's sneaking a sandwich on
78:59 the side I don't know so there it is one
79:02 big episode the ties together the basics
79:06 we have a job to do and it's to control
79:09 our growth on this planet it's a real
79:13 job we need to do it but to lie to get
79:16 it come on come on
79:19 the two biggest countries in the world
79:21 that are overpopulating have no
79:23 obligation for any of this so even if
79:25 you bought into the lie technology to
79:29 get this done it's not going to change
79:31 China it's not going to change India
79:33 right a big smokestacks were a problem
79:38 for the health of all human beings and
79:40 like this whole doomsday thing of
79:43 Inconvenient Truth by Al Gore then we
79:45 would go to China and Indians say we're
79:48 gonna give you about a month to turn
79:49 those things off and if you don't we're
79:53 gonna nuke you from space man it's all
79:55 going down there's gonna be sorties over
79:57 your [ __ ] country until all your
80:00 factories are [ __ ] ash but it's not
80:03 happening right because it isn't that
80:06 isn't that doomsday that's a fictional
80:09 construct that we keep believing would
80:13 it be interesting if every country on
80:14 this planet was charged with a mission
80:16 charged with a book report they have to
80:19 write about their country and the book
80:21 report says how are you going to handle
80:25 population growth in your country take
80:28 whatever you have and multiply it times
80:30 100 how are you going to handle each
80:33 stage of every half billion people that
80:36 you add to your country where you're
80:38 gonna house them how you gonna feed them
80:40 turn your report in let's do next week
80:43 China India we're really looking forward
80:46 to your report you have to show
80:48 indicators of how fast you're populating
80:50 indicators of and programs that you're
80:52 doing to try and reduce population and
80:54 again they're given women's cell phones
80:56 in India to have hysterectomies to make
81:00 sure they can't have kids all right they
81:03 get a hundred-dollar crappy little flip
81:04 phone and they give up their chance to
81:07 ever have kids that's one of the
81:08 programs that's going on in India I
81:10 don't know if that girl's 18 years old
81:13 could you imagine her waking up in five
81:15 years when the phone is completely
81:16 useless and she wants to start a family
81:18 and no one will marry her because the
81:20 culture says well I want to have kids
81:21 every guy's like I want to have kids you
81:23 took the phone I'm not gonna marry you
81:24 it's what we have to get serious about
81:26 decent programs right anyway I hope you
81:30 feel me interested in your comments
81:32 bound to pissed off some people watch
81:34 the down arrows on this one we have to
81:36 keep it real which is why if you haven't
81:39 been to deep thoughts radio Calm please
81:41 go there's audio video lock Facebook
81:44 group and a patreon page take care of
81:47 yourself
81:47 someone else and I'll see you in the
81:48 next deep thoughts over now
