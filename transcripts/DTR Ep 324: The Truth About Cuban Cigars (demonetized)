00:23 you
00:24 [Music]
00:34 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:36 deep thoughts today is going to be a
00:41 special little episode for those who are
00:44 interested for those who aren't you're
00:47 not going to watch this so it's going to
00:49 get probably very limited views but it
00:53 might be one of the most valuable
00:54 episodes if you are curious about Cuban
00:57 cigars and especially if you're addicted
01:00 to non Cuban cigars I've mentioned is
01:04 just a little bit of this in my cigars
01:08 episode there we go
01:12 as I smoke this beautiful H upman from
01:16 kuba
01:19 so cigars aren't for everyone I'm gonna
01:23 recap just a little bit about cigars in
01:26 general just in case you're new because
01:28 you could be interested in this and
01:30 you've never smoked a cigar in your life
01:31 and you're like okay wait I only have
01:32 the basics here I won't make you take
01:35 the full prerequisite to get the good
01:37 information on Cubans but I'm going to
01:41 dispel myths about new world cigars and
01:45 dispel myths about Cuban cigars it's
01:48 mostly going to be dismissing the
01:51 overall benefits of new world and
01:56 dismiss the myths about how average or I
02:03 don't know incidental Cuban cigars are
02:07 for those of you who get it you're gonna
02:11 be enjoying this hopefully and probably
02:13 potentially learning information about
02:15 how to age your Cubans a little bit more
02:17 now the first thing that people think
02:19 about and if you're like me you're
02:22 taught that tobacco of any kind when you
02:26 smoke it when you set it on fire and you
02:28 pull some of the smoke into your mouth
02:29 you were gonna die of cancer
02:31 instantaneously well in today's culture
02:36 I'm not sure you can even remotely track
02:38 where one catches cancer curing it well
02:41 go see my episode on cancer to hear
02:45 several techniques that have worked
02:47 extreme
02:48 well for friends of mine and
02:49 second-degree friends of mine
02:51 b-17 vitamin being the most powerful one
02:55 that is just utterly cleared out my
02:58 friends cancer from stage four breast
03:01 cancer to prostate cancer to just every
03:06 form of cancer it's amazing but there's
03:10 a lot of regiments you have to add to
03:12 whatever you're doing it's basically
03:13 less is more you won't lose your hair
03:15 you won't puke your guts out and you'll
03:17 be well most likely but there there's a
03:23 sad myth about cigars which I bought up
03:26 until probably G's 2010 and that is that
03:31 cigarettes and cigars have any
03:33 similarity whatsoever
03:36 now again depending on your health
03:39 depending on your allergies two things
03:42 you know tobacco in general could be bad
03:45 for you so you need to do your own due
03:47 diligence I have been I've had a CDC
03:52 report share with me that said that
03:53 people that smoke cigars once a day has
03:56 6% less cancer than those who didn't
03:59 smoke at all isn't that interesting if
04:01 that's true it's related to stress but a
04:06 cigarette is not tobacco is not tobacco
04:10 is not tobacco let me say it again
04:12 you think you're smoking tobacco which
04:15 is smoking just a tiny tiny amount of
04:17 tobacco they can't grow tobacco fast
04:22 enough to supply cigarette smokers with
04:24 tobacco and so they made a thing out of
04:29 paper and insulation from your ceiling
04:32 to substitute for that that problem so
04:36 you know when you get a cigarette it's a
04:38 it's a white paper on the outside okay
04:41 well that's not tobacco you know the
04:43 filter isn't tobacco and even though the
04:45 filter seems like it's really strong and
04:48 put together you're sucking on four or
04:50 five of these a day or 20 of these a day
04:52 or 40 of these things a day a to packer
04:55 you're sucking the particles from the
04:57 filter down into your lungs which shred
05:00 your sacs
05:01 which the little things that metabolize
05:03 oxygen into your bloodstream but the
05:07 stuff inside you think about the brown
05:09 stuffs tobacco right no the brown stuff
05:12 is paper you have this syrup that they
05:16 create which is full of an amazing
05:19 amount of chemicals to give you the same
05:20 toxic high okay they give you a toxic
05:23 guy that a tobacco leaf burning in your
05:27 mouth would give you naturally and so
05:31 you are burning all these chemicals
05:32 they're trying to guess strain it out
05:34 with a filter but you can still buy pall
05:36 mall Lucky Strike with no filters and so
05:40 that's why you die of cigarettes plus
05:43 major difference between cigars and
05:46 cigarettes you inhale cigarettes you do
05:48 not inhale cigars
05:49 if anybody's inhaling cigar they're
05:51 typically a former smoker usually like a
05:54 cigarette smoker and they're very heavy
05:56 smoker such that when they pull on one
05:58 of these they don't die I know folks
06:01 that smoke you know five a day ten a day
06:04 and they can't take a single puff on one
06:06 of these and let it go down their lungs
06:07 because they will cough up their guts
06:09 okay the Native Americans are the ones
06:13 that that conceived of this the Chiefs
06:16 used to smoke you know tons of this
06:19 stuff they lived ripe old ages etc most
06:25 of the celebrities in the world that got
06:26 a chance to smoke anywhere for between
06:29 10 15 and 20 cigars a day lived to be a
06:32 hundred okay so the only thing you need
06:35 to be you know a little careful with is
06:38 that there's a law of particulates in a
06:41 human body which means don't inhale a
06:44 little bit inhale yeah you know we all
06:46 hang out at campfires and we don't catch
06:48 cancer we we ride trains and we don't
06:51 catch cancer you know so you can breathe
06:53 a little bit in there I just want to set
06:54 that up so that you understand taxation
06:56 against cigarettes that's immediately
06:58 applied to cigars as a bunk argument
07:01 okay now for those in vaping
07:04 you got to be crazy you know all the
07:06 flavor chemicals are extremely bad for
07:09 you and you get I think 40% to 300% more
07:15 tobacco in your system so I don't know
07:19 and they inhale so it's like a big kind
07:21 of portable hookah you know so just you
07:25 know keep that in mind if you start
07:27 feeling bad back off any of your habits
07:29 until you start feeling good get an idea
07:31 of what's going on
07:32 now that the disclaimers out of the way
07:36 Cuban cigars
07:38 there are Cuban cigars and there are new
07:42 world cigars
07:42 new world cigars simply means it wasn't
07:45 made in Cuba that's all it means a lot
07:48 of families deserted Cuba and took the
07:50 seeds and moved them to South America
07:54 the continent Nicaragua Dominican
07:59 Republic but they grow tobacco all over
08:01 the world don't they we grow a bunch of
08:04 the Americas but they grow it everywhere
08:08 in the Indonesia Malaysia China I think
08:11 even Africa wherever you can make a crop
08:13 happen they'll grow the rugged crop
08:16 which is tobacco but not all tobacco's
08:21 equal the shape and the island alone in
08:26 Cuba gives Cuban tobacco an advantage if
08:31 you know what you're looking for within
08:34 Cuba you have tons of farms growing
08:40 Cuban tobacco and most of it's all
08:44 harvested together and all cigars are
08:47 crafted out of the various tastes of the
08:50 Cuban tobacco that's there and you
08:52 should know that in Cuba an average
08:54 citizen like myself could grow a
08:56 backyard full of tobacco I could harvest
09:00 it and sell it directly to one of the
09:02 state centers so just like Americans
09:05 take all of their recycling and go to
09:08 recycling centers to get paid same thing
09:11 goes for the Cuban tobacco that is not
09:14 grown by the big growers because there's
09:15 gigantic growers but even with in queue
09:19 there's a specialty when Fidel Castro
09:22 gain control over Cuba in the early 60s
09:25 he was obviously a cigar enthusiast the
09:29 average amount of cigars that he's
09:30 rumored to smoke a day is about 18 and
09:33 again he almost made it 200 folks but he
09:36 had commissioned a cigar called the
09:39 Cohiba
09:41 Cohiba is the most highly counterfeited
09:45 cigar in the world
09:46 I have probably seen as many
09:50 counterfeits as I have seen legitimate
09:52 cigars legitimate Cohibas I should say
09:55 and their Cohibas black bang Cohibas
09:58 which are utter floor slop that's not
10:00 the same thing if you're Cohiba isn't
10:03 costing you $30 American you're probably
10:08 nowhere close to a rule Cohiba
10:10 although counterfeits will sell all the
10:12 time for $75 that kind of thing you want
10:17 to get the box crack it open you know
10:19 look at the serial numbers on the
10:21 outside we'll get to all that stuff but
10:23 the farms that grow Cohiba tobacco are
10:26 not shared with any of the other cigars
10:28 so that in itself is why it is the most
10:31 premium considered one of the most
10:33 premium cigars out there they're well
10:36 constructed they're beautiful and they
10:38 taste great now new worlds again can be
10:43 made from anywhere they could have any
10:46 quality of tobacco but here's the thing
10:51 yours truly started out with new world
10:53 cigars as almost every single person in
10:56 America has to because we've got this
10:58 beef with Castro old white guys have a
11:02 beef with Castro Europe and the rest of
11:05 the world is not in this demented grudge
11:07 holding the [ __ ] game and so they can
11:09 all start off with Cubans what's
11:12 interesting about being an American and
11:13 starting off in a new world stash and
11:17 again there's thousands and thousands of
11:19 new world cigars because anybody who's
11:21 not Cuban giving you know growing it and
11:23 harvesting it in Cuba
11:25 it's not Cuban right the amount of
11:31 cigars in the new world realm that
11:34 tastes anything like a Cuban you could
11:36 probably count on one hand and it's only
11:40 a hint of what Cuban cigars taste like
11:44 but now what's interesting is you in
11:46 America you have this crazy hatred for
11:50 Cuban cigars by people who all guess
11:53 what they've never smoked a Cuban in
11:55 their life are they've puffed on one new
12:00 world cigars are tent amount to like a
12:03 sledgehammer in your face usually they
12:07 are not necessarily poorly made by any
12:10 stretch of the imagination they're not
12:12 made of bad tobacco it's just the taste
12:17 profiles are very loud in a lot of cases
12:21 now a lot of times it's difficult to
12:24 tell tell people the difference between
12:25 the New World and the Cuban smoke but
12:28 having just told you it was very loud
12:29 smoke now they make a Macanudo 's and
12:32 that kind of stuff that's very very
12:34 light a lot of people call it air
12:36 because you smoke the cigar and it's so
12:37 light that you don't really get the
12:42 sense that you're smoking a cigar until
12:44 maybe the very end but most people have
12:48 been inundated their entire life with
12:50 the concept of wine and perhaps
12:53 champagne wine champagnes and liqueurs I
12:57 should say to the wines especially where
13:02 you get your grapes makes a big
13:04 difference right how those grapes are
13:07 prepared how they are stored where
13:12 they're stored in you know wood barrels
13:14 or gonna have half and half aluminum
13:16 wood barrels all aluminum whether or not
13:19 the barrel was on the edge of the
13:22 warehouse versus the center it all makes
13:25 a difference right then when it's
13:28 finally bottled how the bottle is stored
13:30 what temperature's is it stored at and
13:33 there's a million religions around that
13:35 whole thing the craftsmanship of any
13:39 cigar in the
13:39 world that is not necess I am made and
13:43 there's some great machine made cigars
13:44 out there let me tell you especially on
13:46 the Cuban side it's as meticulous as
13:49 wine if not three or four times more
13:53 intense than wine I was told and I
13:57 believe this is very true because I've
13:58 heard it from multiple sources the
14:00 number only goes up that the average $5
14:03 cigar still has an average of about 300
14:07 people that have touched the tobacco and
14:09 moved it before you get a chance to
14:12 light it on fire and put it in your
14:13 mouth
14:15 now perhaps for a Cohiba or something
14:18 very special and eclectic maybe the
14:20 number goes down a little bit but then
14:22 you talking about the the crafters the
14:25 blenders and those that contribute to
14:27 its construction are probably the best
14:29 in the world so yeah you know it's like
14:32 having a thousand Ford Motor Company
14:34 mechanics touch your car or you know a
14:37 dozen Lamborghini guys touch your car
14:39 it's a little bit different right but
14:42 here's what I have discovered when you
14:46 get into new world cigars you were
14:47 talking about drastically different
14:50 taste profiles almost an out of control
14:53 mechanism of trying to control strength
14:56 versus body meaning strength is how
15:00 powerful the cigar hits you and
15:02 displaces your blood sugar levels
15:04 whereas body is the taste it's that's
15:08 what everyone's going for they're trying
15:09 to figure out you know whether or not
15:11 the cigar is one-dimensional meaning
15:13 from the second you light it to the
15:14 second to finish it it's the same exact
15:16 taste all the way down which is
15:18 technically almost impossible I think of
15:19 Macanudo pulls out pretty good but then
15:23 you have the fact that the tip has been
15:24 open for a while it's putting out how it
15:26 was stored and so the first interest
15:28 show so is usually a little dry a little
15:31 ashy and then as soon as you get to the
15:33 center point you're getting the master
15:36 blend whoever designed this cigar that's
15:38 exactly the taste they wanted you to
15:39 have as you move down close to the band
15:42 you start getting the the cherry the
15:46 fire starts getting close
15:47 everything starts heating up and you can
15:49 get some fairly intense sort of syrup
15:54 Tarr intense flavors and that's where
15:57 you get all of your strengths if there's
15:58 gonna be strengthen the cigar it's gonna
16:00 be down towards the bottom here but what
16:04 I had was you know probably about four
16:07 or five years of smoky new world cigars
16:09 and enjoying myself right because I
16:11 didn't know any better there are people
16:14 on YouTube that are famous for reviewing
16:18 your world cigars
16:19 I had a show there's two like six or
16:23 seven videos up there it's called real
16:24 time cigar review I'm reviewing new
16:27 world cigars but the mortar hum Gatton
16:31 cigar lounges and talked to people that
16:33 smoked I realized that my opinion is
16:35 really of little value to anyone because
16:37 all of our taste buds are different but
16:42 you have folks that are new world cigar
16:44 buffs I mean they'll smoke a junior $2
16:48 50 cent cigar all the way up to maybe
16:50 $100 overhyped new world cigar and
16:55 anytime someone mentions Cuban cigars
16:57 they take a big [ __ ] on them now some of
17:02 the times they take craps on Cubans
17:04 because they can't get them and so you
17:06 hate what you can't have that way you
17:08 don't you have no problem sleeping at
17:10 night I guess hugging your pillow the
17:12 second reason that I think people crap
17:14 on Cubans is that they're used to the
17:16 big giant loud flavors in their mouth
17:19 the two buck Chuck's if you will and
17:23 they when they drink a fine wine or eat
17:27 some fine food they can't taste it as
17:31 much because their taste buds are so
17:35 just abused by new world cigars that it
17:38 doesn't make an impression now I will
17:42 say that one thing that does occur with
17:44 at least men I don't I've never heard a
17:46 woman admit this but my men and my
17:49 family have said this as you get older
17:51 you can't get to a point where your
17:54 taste buds and your smell just simply
17:58 vanishes about 75 or so you'll just eat
18:01 texture I dearly hope that doesn't
18:04 happen for me
18:04 but it might
18:06 in that particular exclusive case if you
18:09 had a milder cigar it might not register
18:14 at all you know in the system you know
18:18 the guys will like spicier food the
18:20 older that they get because their taste
18:22 buds one you get tired of all the other
18:25 sugary crap but you need that you
18:29 appreciate that that that rush of spice
18:32 and maybe your adrenaline that pops into
18:34 your bloodstream as a result of feeling
18:37 like you might be dying you will also
18:40 have folks that incubate ignorance on a
18:45 level that's just unbelievable with
18:47 cigars it is almost like The Heretic
18:49 days of you know accusing people of
18:52 being witches and taking them out and
18:53 killing them and I'm just gonna throw
18:55 this in there before we jump into all
18:57 the details on the Cuban side the two
18:59 giant myths about cigars in general that
19:02 I see guys just [ __ ] all over themselves
19:04 they feel like their major cigar experts
19:07 and theirs I'm gonna tell you right now
19:08 if if you know anyone who's against
19:11 these two things you're dealing with a
19:13 rookie of mammoth proportions okay no
19:17 matter what they've said about cigars
19:18 up to the point of pissing themselves on
19:21 these two issues you can just subtract
19:23 it out of your life just to get rid of
19:25 all of their advice because they don't
19:26 know what the [ __ ] they're talking about
19:27 and they're unable to think for
19:29 themselves basically right one is that
19:33 there is a it's really funny it's only a
19:39 big concern I think too because there's
19:43 two sides of this game there's something
19:45 called mold and there's something called
19:46 plume and they get often confused a
19:50 moldy cigar as if you've seen mold in
19:53 your life it's usually very dark it's
19:56 very green and it starts to consume the
19:58 cigar like if you got some mold right
20:00 here it'll start digging into the cigar
20:02 it's a living organism right and then
20:06 there's plume which is a powdery white
20:09 dust that you will get on your cigars
20:11 and those that are in the know will look
20:15 for plume I consider that a benefit and
20:17 they'll avoid mole
20:20 and only because the the mold destroys
20:24 the actual cigar it destroys the
20:26 integrity it'll break your wrapper and
20:27 you'll be smoking you know and a bunch
20:29 of smokes coming out the middle of your
20:31 cigar but guys will get online and the
20:35 see plume and call it mold all the time
20:38 and again you can just wipe plume off if
20:41 it's really bothering you right I've
20:43 never heard of anyone getting remotely
20:44 sick from plume ever like I was fine and
20:48 then ice touch the plume and I turned
20:51 into a pot and I came out and I was you
20:53 know it was a Body Snatcher or something
20:57 right and a complete [ __ ] [ __ ]
21:00 right but regardless you're going to
21:04 burn it you're going to burn it and and
21:07 ingest the byproduct of the tobacco
21:10 which is going to be 99.9% of whatever
21:12 happens depending how much mold you have
21:13 in your cigar yeah
21:14 I don't smoke moldy cigars I don't buy
21:16 moldy cigars I've never known anyone
21:19 besides a gas station or kind of a
21:21 convenience store that sells them
21:23 they've ever seen moment pictures of it
21:27 online so plume hey if it bothers you
21:32 just wipe it off and smokey right
21:35 actually guys 100 all our cigars throw
21:38 it away because some douchebag online
21:41 has got a show who freaks everybody out
21:43 about how key you got my point the
21:47 second one is dying off slowly but again
21:52 if you've been following a guy on
21:53 YouTube that tells you that the second
21:56 one is bad again you're dealing with the
21:58 rookie why fill up your life with those
22:01 people why listen to them even if
22:03 they're extremely articulate we'll get
22:04 to that in a second but the other one is
22:06 if you aged a cigar or you have a cigar
22:10 that looks like it's fairly dehydrated
22:11 but you touch it and you squeeze it and
22:13 it's okay but it's just like wow the
22:14 wrapper is really you know fragile on
22:17 this thing I need to make sure that it
22:18 when I punch it when I cut it it doesn't
22:21 explode when you smoke it on with the
22:23 wrapper to unravel that kind of stuff
22:26 and it has to do with what my buddy and
22:30 I are now dubbing called baptizing a
22:32 cigar
22:33 some people call it dunking what you do
22:36 is you take the cigar before you cut the
22:38 top off right so it's all sealed up nice
22:40 you run some faucet water hopefully
22:42 filtered if you can do it and you know
22:45 you get the water to go straight down
22:47 and not some gigantic tidal wave okay
22:50 just enough to create a nice little
22:51 stream but you take your cigar you put
22:55 it under the water hold it there for six
22:56 seconds and then you pull it out then
22:59 you turn the water off and you go to
23:00 wherever the hell you're gonna smoke
23:01 your cigar give it about sixty seconds
23:04 before you start plowing into the thing
23:06 opening it up and a couple things will
23:09 dawn on you very quickly within sixty
23:12 Seconds your cigar is pretty much dry a
23:14 couple little specks here and there but
23:17 you also know that the wrapper totally
23:20 came alive it totally hydrated it's
23:22 beautiful I'm almost at a point where
23:24 yeah I could dunk every single cigar
23:27 that I have you know but you have guys
23:30 on line that know [ __ ] all about cigars
23:32 but they really want to put off the vibe
23:34 that they know about cigars and they'll
23:37 take shits on this whole technique and
23:39 they'll say that you're destroying the
23:41 cigar that's the that's the dumb [ __ ]
23:44 proof that whoever you're listening to
23:47 has no concept of basic physics or
23:49 anything right now what did I just do I
23:54 put at the end of the cigar into my
23:57 mouth well I don't know about you but
23:59 even on a dry day anything I put my
24:02 mouth gets wet all right hold the jokes
24:05 for later so by the time I get done with
24:09 this cigar and any cigar that I smoke
24:11 the first 1/2 inch of this cigar is
24:15 gonna be soaking wet why because I put
24:18 it in my mouth every time I pull on it
24:20 right a little bit different than a
24:22 cigarette because cigarettes are lit
24:24 gone within you know a few minutes
24:27 cigars gonna last you hopefully an hour
24:30 to two and a half hours depending on
24:32 what you're smoking and how much you
24:33 feel like you gotta pound the thing if
24:36 you just came out of rush hour traffic
24:37 it'd probably go down to about 45
24:38 minutes but I have smoked nearly 40-year
24:42 old cigars I've watched my buddy smoke
24:46 nearly hundred-year-old cigars aged
24:48 Cubans and these are the techniques that
24:52 the experts of the world use when you
24:57 like to stick after you baptize it you
25:01 will notice it's super rich and
25:03 beautiful if you were to take one that
25:06 was baptized the one that wasn't and you
25:07 do this you know this one is experienced
25:11 the one that wasn't baptized is
25:12 extremely dry sorry for those on podcast
25:15 I always forget you can't see my hands
25:17 but it brings it back to life and it's a
25:19 beautiful thing and what's what's
25:23 interesting is it's like I hate to do
25:25 this to you guys but I get the analogy
25:28 of people that are against guns 99.999%
25:33 of the time anybody who's pissin and
25:35 moanin about a Second Amendment to
25:36 protect the first you go have you shot a
25:38 gun no dumb there no one should ever
25:42 shoot guns okay you big [ __ ] so you
25:45 hate something you've never tried yeah
25:46 and I suppose you hate a bunch of food
25:48 you never tried to write it could
25:50 someone get this [ __ ] little kid out
25:52 of here you know we're trying to run a
25:54 country so the big boys are here right
25:56 same thing goes for cigars in general
25:58 these stupid little rules that people
26:00 put together so they could be fo x PERTs
26:03 is hilarious right take a poop and relax
26:06 okay
26:07 but why do people smoke cigars in
26:09 general well there's two factors to it
26:12 typically for the personal self the
26:16 social elements off the chain you know
26:18 like you meet people and have you know
26:21 you'll just build lifelong friendships
26:22 in cigar lounges or other places where
26:25 people smoke but the personal reasons
26:28 are typically the blood sugar level
26:30 adjustments so it calms you down you
26:32 know if you give you're a little
26:33 stressed out and the second one is the
26:37 taste and I know ladies those of you who
26:40 do not smoke cigars or you never smoke
26:43 cigarettes or what have you or anyone
26:46 who has an experience that you hear this
26:47 tasting and you're like oh right yeah
26:49 because your breath smells awesome after
26:51 you smoke a cigar it is a very weird
26:53 thing that if I sit next to an ashtray
26:56 full of cigar ashes
26:58 it I gotta go throw it out because the
27:01 pungent ash smell from the remnants of a
27:05 cigars gross to me it's just so
27:07 disturbing to my presence right when I
27:11 do smell someone else's breath and I
27:14 haven't smoked from cigars it's gross
27:18 it's weird the ashy smell that you have
27:21 on your body after you smoke is really
27:23 odd sometimes gonna be okay sometimes
27:25 not Cubans it's a little bit better in
27:27 my opinion but you know when we taste
27:30 the cigar I mean the way I learned how
27:32 to taste is actually pretty effective
27:33 there's two sides to it
27:36 you take a puff and you slowly let the
27:39 smoke fall out of your mouth now with
27:41 Cubans you get a whole different thing
27:43 going on the other one is too retro hell
27:45 through your nose now with new real
27:48 cigars because they are so loud and so
27:50 young and immature in my opinion because
27:53 they're hardly ever aged it's just a
27:56 it's like being dunked underwater when
27:58 you do a retro you know that Bernie
28:00 knows feeling horrible with the Cuban
28:04 that has been aged five years or more
28:07 again we're gonna get into Aging in a
28:10 second here you're dealing with the
28:13 finest tobacco flavors that you could
28:17 possibly isolate and so retro creates
28:22 just an absolute kaleidoscope of flavors
28:25 and almost fourth-dimensional experience
28:28 I mean you'll you'll sort of journey
28:31 throughout the universe when you're
28:32 doing this or you go right to where they
28:33 harvested the tobacco in the first place
28:36 I know it sounds a little strange but
28:38 I've smoked tons of new worlds and never
28:41 really had any religious experiences you
28:43 know with taste it's going yeah that's
28:45 pretty good that's all right and then
28:47 you get into a Cuban just like an
28:50 average Cuban that's five years old or
28:52 so I spoke to four year old Cuban the
28:53 other day that was as good as a 20 year
28:57 old Cuban it's just phenomenal so
28:59 sometimes you just get a perfect batch
29:00 right but when you taste a cigar or
29:04 pretty much anything but a cigar is an
29:06 amazing thing
29:07 you actually have if you pay attention
29:12 a chronology of how your body is is
29:14 registering the flavor so you have the
29:16 walls of your mouth you got your tongue
29:18 and then you have your nasal canal that
29:20 is all contributing to a dimensional
29:21 experience in your brain now this sounds
29:24 a little bit heavy but once you think
29:26 this through then you have the
29:27 experience you will be on another level
29:30 with folks so I want to do this episode
29:33 how many of you are familiar with
29:35 amputees feeling phantom pain they've
29:38 lost a finger a leg and arm or whatever
29:41 but they still feel the limb there and
29:44 it takes a long time to educate the
29:45 brain that it's not there anymore right
29:47 some people claim they feel it for the
29:48 rest of their lives right well when you
29:51 do have your body especially your taste
29:53 buds and your nose your brain is
29:56 creating a three-dimensional image
29:58 inside of your soul whatever the hell we
30:01 are made out of of the information
30:04 that's coming in in a dimensional sort
30:07 of hologram inside your your senses
30:09 inside your mind inside your little
30:11 Malkovich room in there so when you pull
30:15 in smoke from a Cuban especially and
30:19 again Cuban we are going to be dealing
30:20 with super fine brush strokes in the
30:25 painting your new world cigars is kind
30:28 of like you know you're you're like 2 or
30:31 3 months old you can barely hold your
30:33 head up and you got a big brush and
30:34 you're just doing bam bam [ __ ] to a
30:36 canvas that's a new world cigar it's not
30:39 the end of the world that that's the way
30:41 it is but it is truly drawing with the
30:44 crayons that have the flat side on them
30:45 right in order to get to this stage
30:49 before I totally dive down into this
30:51 more existential side of the tastebuds
30:55 the way I talk to folks that come in to
30:58 buy cigars at my buddy's shop is I say
31:00 look if you've been smoking new worlds
31:02 forever
31:03 and you want to go find yourself a Cuban
31:05 with somebody need to understand that
31:07 you're probably going to need a few days
31:10 off of the new worlds because you're
31:14 going to be so maladjusted to various
31:18 super loud flavors that in order for you
31:20 to even taste the basic splendor of a
31:23 Cuban you're going to have to wash that
31:25 out
31:25 you know again it would be if you're
31:28 kind of a binge drinker and you only
31:31 drink vodka brand vodka and I hand you a
31:34 $300 bottle of wine or champagne and I'm
31:38 saying okay slow down this is you know
31:41 30 bucks a glass okay take your time
31:45 now just sip a little bit smell it
31:47 smelling in your nose and let it come
31:49 out of your mouth before you even drink
31:51 it it's gonna take a while to come off
31:54 that coolers Lite regiment to get over
31:57 to like a Rothschild wine of some sort
32:01 right same thing was a cigar going from
32:05 New World to Cuban you got to pull out
32:07 so that you can understand the
32:09 brilliance of what's going on here one
32:12 of the things that I think is strange
32:13 and it it's not always the case because
32:15 there's a lot of perversion out there
32:16 but a lot of really good people who are
32:19 very wealthy and variant smart when they
32:23 gravitate away from what the public
32:24 likes I'm always interested I'm always
32:26 like I'm not like I don't have to join
32:28 us on [ __ ] Eyes Wide Shut party but
32:30 you know it's like fine dining well what
32:33 do you think is fine daddy maybe they're
32:34 completely full of crap but a lot of
32:37 times you'll find out that oh yeah
32:38 they've been through the swill or maybe
32:41 they've avoid the swill their entire
32:43 life and they eat the finest stuff in
32:44 the world for me a cubed cigar is right
32:47 up at that level right so you're gonna
32:49 have a bunch of flavors that come out of
32:51 your mouth and you're gonna have a bunch
32:53 of flavors that you could add by doing a
32:55 little bit of retro about your nose
32:57 which is essentially pulling the cloud
33:00 you do not inhale and then just breathe
33:03 out your nose and it all go straight out
33:05 your nose take your time on that one
33:07 because a big giant cloud of smoke can
33:10 burn a little bit at first so you can
33:13 just let little tiny puffs out of your
33:14 nose the other technique that I
33:16 absolutely love with Cubans is when I'm
33:19 letting it out of my mouth and those of
33:21 you smoke weed you see this all the time
33:23 on album covers let a little bit in your
33:25 nose
33:26 okay just little puffy smells and you
33:29 will get this incredible 3-dimensional
33:31 sampling your mouth your nose and then
33:34 your mouth to your nose it's very
33:36 interesting I have not found you
33:39 rewarding in the slightest to do all
33:42 three with any new world cigar you know
33:46 probably the most expensive new world
33:47 cigar I've ever smoked is 80 bucks right
33:51 I've smoked I've smoked the davit off in
33:53 Cuba in the late eighties cost me 300
33:57 bucks it wasn't worth it no matter how
34:00 good Cuban cigars are it just wasn't
34:03 worth it
34:04 the other nice thing about Cuban cigars
34:06 is that you can pretty much close your
34:07 eyes and pick up any stick that has the
34:11 body and the strength that you're
34:12 looking for now I don't know anyone on
34:16 planet earth that wants zero body okay
34:18 everybody wants a hundred percent body
34:20 which is flavor when it comes to
34:24 strength you'll have folks that are you
34:27 know mild medium and and heavy right
34:30 just got to figure out for yourself it
34:32 usually has to do with your body size
34:36 but I know a little pipsqueaks to just
34:39 love sticks that would put me on my back
34:41 you know I'm just not into it now again
34:45 if you're brand new to the scars and
34:46 you're watching this episode if you ever
34:47 get sick smoking a cigar just bring some
34:50 candy with you some chocolate or
34:53 something or drink a soda you just need
34:55 a little bit of sugar in your system
34:56 within a minute 60 seconds you should be
34:59 okay so don't let that get you and if
35:02 you are having that issue you have one
35:04 of two things you're doing that you may
35:05 want to be careful with one you've got a
35:07 heavy cigar in the strength realm and
35:09 you probably shouldn't buy that stick
35:11 again you should whatever you're buying
35:12 it from you just say look man I'm not
35:13 interested in strength just body the
35:16 other one is you could have sort of a
35:17 medium strength cigar but you're puffing
35:20 too fast
35:21 so you're just inundating your saliva
35:23 with the tobacco which then goes into
35:25 your bloodstream and starts to make it
35:27 be a little easy right now you hear a
35:31 lot of weird rumors about aging cigars
35:33 and I'm gonna link to my one of my best
35:37 friends on the planet Dave who calls
35:40 himself the dude as well we created two
35:42 shows on YouTube and called ourselves
35:43 the dude and we got together and
35:46 high-fived but he is a I think a world
35:50 expert in Cubans and I mean he's
35:53 a guy who does videos in two locations
35:56 he lives in two different places but I
35:59 think that one of the many I have to
36:05 leave this name out for reasons but
36:08 probably one of the most celebrated
36:12 cuban experts by the rest of the world
36:15 thinks that his palate my buddy's palate
36:19 is one of the best in the planet and
36:21 they work together all the time let's
36:26 put that way so when you're watching his
36:29 videos if you're interested in cubans he
36:32 is a master at this stuff and I mean he
36:35 studies Cuban cigars like hawking
36:38 studied [ __ ] theoretical physics
36:41 right but he really gets into it except
36:43 my buddies correct and his assessments
36:47 but one of the things that comes around
36:50 is aging cigars with new world I don't
36:53 know if there's a hell of a lot of
36:55 reason to get past maybe five or ten
36:57 years typically what happens is you get
37:00 a cigar and just like a wine it has
37:03 tannins in it which can make it kind of
37:06 sour and kind of heavy right and the
37:11 more that you age it these things calm
37:14 down and neutralize completely out of
37:15 cigar but you have to follow some
37:20 special rules when you're actually doing
37:22 the aging process in a nutshell you have
37:27 temperature and humidity RH relative
37:29 humidity which is the humidity within
37:31 the device of which you're actually
37:33 humidifying these things there is there
37:37 there have been and there are humidors
37:41 around the world cigar shops around the
37:43 world where people store millions of
37:45 dollars worth of cigars of their clients
37:47 and of their own stock and they age them
37:50 just like just like wine except in the
37:54 in the cigar realm they don't make the
37:55 cigar it's a it's the interesting thing
37:57 imagine me buying a ton of wine off some
38:01 some vineyard in Northern California and
38:04 then I hang on to it I
38:06 and then I sell it you know this happens
38:08 especially on Rodeo Drive
38:10 but with cigars it's the same way so
38:13 they buy all these Cuban cigars then the
38:15 agent for five 10 15 20 30 years and of
38:20 course the price just goes up and up
38:22 because the stick is now this priceless
38:25 experience that you had to wait 30 years
38:28 to have this taste happen inside your
38:30 system I don't know of any new world
38:32 cigar that can last that long and
38:34 actually have this experience maybe
38:36 there is but they never make it that far
38:37 do they because they're cheap II little
38:39 sticks right so you'll read some
38:41 articles you watch some videos online
38:42 it's a you can't age a cigar beyond 10
38:45 years beyond 10 years it's completely
38:46 pointless the stick turns into basically
38:48 paper and that is one of the critiques
38:52 that you will find from someone who is
38:54 new world and Cuban swapping it within a
38:57 single day so they're blowing out all
38:59 their taste buds with this new world
39:01 thing and then they're trying to
39:02 appreciate a fine woman it doesn't work
39:05 that way you got a you know get off one
39:08 and move to the other for several days
39:10 and then change right no full disclosure
39:13 I can smoke a new world on a Saturday
39:16 and smoke a Cuban on a Sunday and get
39:18 all the beauty of it right but then I'm
39:21 slowing down my mind and realizing you
39:23 know what I'm looking for here and you
39:24 can do exactly the same thing what
39:27 happens with aging cigars and we'll get
39:29 into temperature and and humidification
39:31 in a second is that you you're allowing
39:36 the inside of the cigar to ferment right
39:38 cigars from it just like wine and they
39:41 get stronger and stronger as they
39:44 ferment and then they calm down well
39:47 there's a weird roller coaster ride that
39:49 can happen on a cigar where you might
39:52 aged a cigar five years smoked one on
39:55 your box ago yeah you know it won't be
39:57 like that but I mean it will just be
39:59 like okay I don't really feel the big
40:01 difference in this and then you'll let
40:03 it that box go another five years
40:05 pick another stick up smoke it and be
40:07 like oh wow that's amazing
40:09 that's exactly what I'm looking for but
40:11 then you hold on to it for another five
40:12 years take a stick out and you're like
40:13 these are great dude have one and you're
40:15 both going whoa what happened you think
40:18 your box is screwed
40:19 but you wait another five years now
40:21 instead of twenty year mark
40:23 boom it blows up again that's not five
40:27 ten five ten but there are these cycles
40:29 where it will it will get sour and then
40:32 we'll get totally mild and awesome and
40:33 they can get they can get sour again I
40:36 think most of the time cigars that are
40:39 aged pass the sweet point typically
40:42 continue to ride out that sweet point
40:47 for a really really long time now you
40:49 can get cigars that are made in you know
40:52 pre embargo Cuban 1940s that our mind
40:57 blowers and you can get one that's just
40:59 paper that has nothing to it it just
41:02 depends on how it was stored and the
41:05 tobacco of the year it was you know
41:06 rolled you know when you're a kid you're
41:09 told that wine aged is better and then
41:12 you get older and you start seeing these
41:14 oxygens at tiffany's of someone
41:16 auctioning off a four hundred year old
41:17 bottle of wine and when you're young and
41:20 you see that you're like oh my god when
41:22 they open that for $100 or four hundred
41:24 year bottle of wine and drinking it must
41:26 be amazing and then you find out most
41:29 wine connoisseurs know it's just swill
41:33 inside after four hundred years whatever
41:35 was in there yeah so you're just buying
41:38 a you know an interesting relic from
41:40 time so far we don't have aged cigars
41:45 that are 400 years old but hidden my
41:47 buddy is smoked one that's at least 100
41:50 years old and he set some pretty amazing
41:52 experiences but the more you understand
41:56 the families that put these cigars
41:57 together you will have more than just
41:59 the taste in your mind you'll have this
42:01 history in your head right but okay you
42:05 know what we do with food right we put
42:08 food in the refrigerator
42:10 to slow down the aging process on food
42:12 to keep it for a lot longer
42:16 well cigars are exactly the same way the
42:19 hotter our cigars the more it's going to
42:22 rapidly ferment and age humidification
42:25 is an augmentation of that aging process
42:30 as it relates to heat so hot and
42:33 moist is going to eat something a lot
42:35 faster than colder and moist or colder
42:38 and less moist right so there is a
42:42 family and I the names gonna escape me
42:44 here starts with an S I don't want to
42:48 say it wrong I'll link my buddy's video
42:50 in here so you can see the interview
42:51 with the gentleman who discovered it but
42:53 it was a father-son duo the father had
42:57 actually figured out a way to age Cuban
42:59 cigars in a way that he paralyzed in
43:01 sort of stasis mode the cigars aging
43:05 velocity so he can keep him for a lot
43:07 longer it also turned out that this
43:09 process started creating combinations
43:13 chemical combinations in the cigar that
43:15 make them taste amazing now I'm gonna
43:18 give you some centigrades
43:19 because this is how they do it in Europe
43:22 where this was actually invented the
43:26 optimal temperature for a long term
43:29 storage is about 12 degrees Celsius 10
43:33 to 12 somewhere in there I think 10
43:38 degrees Celsius is 50 degrees Fahrenheit
43:40 because that gives you a little bit of
43:41 an of an idea a lot of humidors like my
43:45 buddy's humidor he can't get it below 14
43:48 degrees Celsius which i think is about
43:49 59 degrees but still you know that's
43:51 pretty cool on the humidification side
43:57 you bring down humidity to below 70
44:04 usually can store it at somewhere in the
44:08 mid 60's again see my buddy's video for
44:10 the details on this which I'll link
44:12 below but you store it like that and it
44:17 starts to slow things down it also gets
44:19 rid of any bugs that are inside the
44:20 cigar because you have these little
44:21 weasels little weasel bugs and get in
44:24 there and they will burrow hole holes in
44:27 the cigar and when you start smoking it
44:28 it's like it's like a cartoon right you
44:31 puff it and it's like smokes coming out
44:32 everywhere the cigar is gone
44:34 so these little beetles that sometimes
44:38 get into cigars it's very actually it's
44:40 I think it's more rare than anything it
44:42 paralyzes their growth because it's too
44:44 cold for them it's not moisture for them
44:46 and they die now you hear that factories
44:51 will actually freeze the cigars right
44:53 after they make them to make sure that
44:55 if there's any bugs in there any any
44:57 molds of any kind that it gets paralyzed
44:59 to death and that way there's no damage
45:02 to the cigar and when they warm it back
45:04 up and ship it out it's ready to go now
45:07 don't try this at home until you've
45:08 really studied how to do that the
45:10 freezing thing because you could I've
45:13 had a buddy of mine who destroyed a
45:14 whole batch of cigars by putting him in
45:17 his roof freezer and I'm not sure he did
45:18 anything other than just put him in his
45:19 freezer and then they turn into old ice
45:22 cream all the crystallization right but
45:26 before you when you want to migrate it
45:28 out of long-term storage to the point
45:30 you're gonna smoke it they raise the
45:33 temperature and they raise the humidity
45:35 to like 72% humidity not quite sure I
45:41 think it's room temperature yeah it's
45:43 room temperature on the temperature side
45:46 of things and they let it sit the four
45:49 to six weeks before they smoke it just
45:51 allowed to kind of grow back into this
45:54 reality it's sort of like all those
45:55 sci-fi movies and people come out of
45:57 stasis that kind of groggy right you got
45:59 to give a cigar four to six weeks before
46:01 you start puffing on it now before you
46:04 think this is hocus-pocus you have folks
46:09 like my buddy who have taken one out of
46:13 cold storage take them one out of this
46:16 cold storage to warm process and then
46:19 one that's been sitting there at room
46:21 temperature the entire time and he will
46:23 smoke between them to figure out whether
46:25 or not there's a flavor profile
46:27 difference and do it with other
46:28 connoisseurs and say you know what do
46:31 you think and they have unanimously come
46:35 back and said wow this one that was cold
46:37 that you allowed to warm back up the
46:40 taste is measurably above the other
46:43 cigars
46:45 all Cuban of course right now what I've
46:50 noticed with cigars and a lot of things
46:52 that people enjoy is that they just
46:55 simply love cigars so much that it
46:57 doesn't really matter the state of the
46:58 cigar for them to totally get off
47:02 smoking it and for a person like that
47:05 you obviously want to celebrate their
47:07 love for the stick but at the same time
47:11 you want to be a little bit careful
47:13 about where you get advice from
47:14 obviously because you don't want to mess
47:16 up you know some vintage cigars that you
47:19 have so if you're if you're a person who
47:23 absolutely loves something then you know
47:26 a lot of this meticulous aging is not
47:28 something you're concerned about because
47:29 you could pick up a three-dollar stick
47:31 and just be like on in heaven right god
47:33 bless you
47:34 you're lucky once I got bit by the aged
47:39 Cuban it made everything else pale in
47:43 comparison
47:43 I smoked no world's now simply to rotate
47:47 my palate through different flavors
47:49 since then when I get back to an aged
47:51 Cuban it's you know bellissimo right so
47:57 what are some of the flavor differences
47:58 and rant in here for a long time here so
48:03 with a Cuban you're going to get for the
48:07 younger Cubans this is a very young not
48:09 aged Cuban here you're going to get hey
48:15 distinct leather tobacco and usually on
48:19 a young one that's about it but it's a
48:23 very subtle amazing thing and and the
48:25 the the quality of those flavors will
48:28 vary depending on the humidification of
48:30 the cigar so if you have a nicely
48:32 humidified cigar for instance you will
48:35 for any of you who you know grew up
48:38 anywhere near the Midwest or a saddle on
48:42 a horse that's what I always think of
48:44 every time I smoked a good Cuban you
48:46 will have a saddle that is old and warm
48:49 you know it was polished at one time it
48:52 was all nice and lacquered up real nice
48:53 but this one's been ridden by grandpa
48:56 for 30 years and it's all like it's like
48:58 suede but
48:59 this way when it was originally made
49:01 right so that's what a young Cuban
49:04 reminds me of is sort of that worn in
49:07 flavor and it's not bad at all
49:10 it's a great nostalgic thing the
49:14 properly humidified Cuban will have more
49:18 of that supple just beautiful in its
49:22 peak leather it's not brand-new
49:25 cellophane wrapped leather it's a nice
49:29 sort of just absolutely manicured
49:31 perfect flavor that you'll get again
49:35 it's subtle but my the the biggest
49:39 flavor that I think that people miss and
49:41 it took me a while to understand it
49:43 is something that a I think a genius min
49:48 Ron knee he's a Chinese man who lives in
49:52 Hong Kong he is the I think he is he
49:56 wrote probably I think he wrote the only
49:57 real book that's been endorsed by the
49:59 Cuban government on all the Cuban cigars
50:01 there's a he he's been working on the
50:04 second edition which the first book is a
50:06 book and the second edition is supposed
50:08 to be a ton of books so we'll see if he
50:10 gets it out the door but he I think was
50:15 the one that coined the phrase medicinal
50:17 now this is gonna sound weird but they
50:20 will say this one has a strong medicinal
50:24 flavor
50:24 now medicinal shows up and something
50:27 that's at least four to five years old
50:29 about four or five years old you start
50:31 getting the hint of this medicinal thing
50:32 and I'll try to do my best to describe
50:34 it 10 years 15 20 years you start
50:38 getting massive medicinal flavor
50:40 now the hell is medicinal doesn't that
50:43 sound awful the best way for me to
50:47 describe medicinal flavor is that again
50:51 if you think about what I was saying
50:52 about the three-dimensional image that
50:54 you get in your brain when you're
50:56 blowing out smoke and smoke has an
50:58 extremely unique texture right it's not
51:00 like eating pudding or a strawberry
51:04 shortcake or your favorite lasagne
51:06 that's all over the place
51:08 splatting around side your mouth and
51:10 your brain can't really create an image
51:11 of it because it's just like if that's
51:12 the slot
51:13 in your face that's that's making you
51:14 have this feeling with a cloud of smoke
51:18 again you will blow it out and it will
51:21 literally cry najuk chronologically coat
51:23 the side of your mouth out the door now
51:25 go up your nasal canal strike your nose
51:28 you know follicles that contribute to
51:30 your taste and then go out your nose and
51:32 then if you keep rotating this in and
51:34 out you have all this amazing detail
51:38 that you can get out of these flavors
51:39 right but smoke has usually one profile
51:44 that in different places in your nasal
51:46 come out in your mouth will give you
51:47 different flavors and again mine are
51:49 different than yours so it's hard for me
51:51 to tell you but I've sat in a room
51:53 enough that I now can tell you that
51:54 there's some definite commonalities
51:56 between two human beings now my buddy
51:57 and Dave and I we have very similar
52:02 taste bouts and so he will say something
52:05 I'm like oh my god yeah yeah it's that
52:07 and the vice versa right the medicinal
52:10 thing is sort of like those Easter eggs
52:14 used to get when you were a kid with
52:15 candy in them like random crap in them
52:18 the medicinal bubble that you'll get
52:21 inside your smoke it's sort of an extra
52:24 little dimension Aged are going to get
52:26 your hey you still going to get your
52:27 leather tobacco flavors but inside the
52:30 medicinal thing you will have but at
52:34 first will seem like a medicine weird
52:37 medicine flavor you know who the hell
52:39 likes medicine flavors when rolled up
52:42 inside this it turns into what we call
52:44 the bean now the first couple months I
52:48 was smoking with my buddy he'd say oh
52:50 there's that beanie flavor in there and
52:51 I'm thinking beans like I think refried
52:54 beans bean salad like last thing I want
52:58 to taste in a cigar is a bean he's like
53:00 oh no no no it's not like that it's like
53:03 a vanilla bean a sweetness and as soon
53:06 as he said that I was like cuz I'm a
53:08 huge vanilla fan there was this epiphany
53:11 the medicinal flavor is typically sort
53:17 of this interesting sweet bubble that
53:22 you can parse depending on how you
53:25 exhale
53:26 so if you just take a big puff and blow
53:28 it out really fast which is a lot of New
53:30 World smokers by holding a average cloud
53:33 of smoke right so nobody deal but if you
53:36 take in an aged Cuban ten years or above
53:40 and it's got that medicinal thing to it
53:42 which almost all of them do you can take
53:44 that medicinal flavor one you don't have
53:47 to puff so much smoke in because then
53:49 you can study it and have this flavor
53:51 but I don't know if any of you've eaten
53:53 a quail egg on a sushi or something like
53:55 that I know it sounds gross but it's
53:57 actually awesome you pop it on the roof
53:59 of your mouth there's no taste to it at
54:01 all it's just like silk it's like a
54:03 honey silk it's amazing same thing
54:05 happens with a medicinal cloud is that
54:10 you rotated out your nose you rotate it
54:12 in your mouth vice versa and so you have
54:14 all these different techniques of
54:15 actually tasting the same exact thing
54:17 and you'll realize so much about your
54:20 taste buds that when you transition to
54:22 food or drink in any other realm you are
54:26 so much more educated about how your
54:28 body tastes things right now sometimes
54:33 that sweetness inside of the medicinal
54:37 bubble has like a Fig Newton like that
54:42 sweet Fig Newton cookie you will also
54:44 get sometimes black licorice when I
54:47 smoked the I forgot the name of them
54:50 those Italian cigars that Clint Eastwood
54:52 smoked and the good the bad the ugly
54:55 they're actually room-temperature cigars
54:57 you don't have to store them and
54:58 humidification they're tapered at both
55:00 ends they're really long and they made
55:01 out of Kentucky it's almost like
55:04 barbecue tobacco it's really interesting
55:08 so the Italians used to buy well they
55:10 still do they buy Kentucky Barbara
55:13 sorry a Kentucky tobacco bring it over
55:15 to Italy and they roll it up and they're
55:16 really really inexpensive you're
55:18 supposed to cut them in half and then
55:19 smoke the two halves but they're fine
55:22 just smoking one side to the other those
55:25 have a massive black licorice flavor to
55:28 them in my opinion once you get bit by
55:33 the medicinal flavor it will be believe
55:38 it or not
55:39 the flavor that you seek out the most
55:41 and if you don't have a source for aged
55:44 Cubans it will become what we call the
55:47 unicorn flavor
55:48 unicorns are obviously very rare in this
55:51 universe right so when someone brings
55:54 you an aged Cuban you will get excited
55:57 as long as this person knows how to you
56:00 know age it like I was saying now the
56:02 other thing about smoking cigars in
56:04 general but most definitely Cuban cigars
56:07 is you see how we're outside and what I
56:11 the foot smoke coming off the end of my
56:13 cigar is just kind of floating away
56:16 that's not how you typically want to
56:18 smoke a Cuban cigar you want to be
56:20 inside someplace preferably with very
56:22 controlled airflow and having very
56:26 little airflow
56:27 last thing you want to do is pay you
56:29 know $20 $20 or more for a cigar and
56:32 every time you puff it you know smokes
56:36 just flying away from your face you want
56:37 the room to fill up with the smoke my
56:41 buddy and I smoked in his garage and we
56:44 hotbox it right we close the door except
56:46 for in summertime but in summertime that
56:49 winds usually pretty still so we'll
56:53 smoke you know a couple sticks and then
56:55 you know break to go to the restroom and
56:57 come back into this garage having had
56:59 the door remains sealed the entire time
57:01 and the smell in the room is one of the
57:04 most amazing smells it doesn't smell
57:06 like any of the flavors you're getting
57:08 off the cigar it's a separate smell it's
57:11 in the room and it is if you could put
57:14 it in a bottle you could make a ton of
57:15 money but even in summertime when a
57:19 really nice stick comes around we'll
57:21 shut that damn door and sweat it out
57:23 with these sticks you know now the one
57:28 thing that happens in the New World side
57:29 of things just to kind of again dismiss
57:31 some of the myths on that side is that
57:34 folks will and I first discovered this
57:38 in alcohol I'm not a drinker really but
57:41 you'll have people that want to seem
57:44 posh right and so they come into a bar
57:48 and they demand this name-brand
57:52 all hold her head up high like they are
57:55 drinking the best [ __ ] on planet Earth
57:58 the the big one was padrone patron
58:02 excuse me the tequila right I have an
58:04 old story where a friend of mine was in
58:06 a bar and the lead singer of creed came
58:09 in and made a huge stink about how he
58:12 only drinks Patron tequila as if that is
58:17 like some super duper top-shelf choice
58:21 he's making when there's a there's like
58:24 thousands of tequila's out there you can
58:26 choose someone I can blown the bottles
58:29 and [ __ ] same with whiskey's and
58:30 Bourbons you know if you know the name
58:33 off the top of your head and it's in
58:34 every single bar you're nowhere close to
58:36 top-shelf you're nowhere near that that
58:38 find liqueur or liqueur that you might
58:41 be drinking right same thing goes for
58:44 cigars in the new world especially
58:47 Cubans honestly have to say the Cubans
58:50 are so consistent as long as the person
58:53 who got them and brought them back from
58:55 Cuba didn't abuse them get the box seal
58:59 that will have you write you loud to
59:02 bring back several hundred dollars worth
59:04 of Cubans now I think it's like eight
59:06 hundred dollars with the Cubans you can
59:07 bring back in your luggage which is what
59:09 happens with the you know the sticks
59:11 around here but there are some gigantic
59:14 brands in the new world realm where
59:16 people swear up and down by them and as
59:19 soon as you know anything about cigars
59:21 especially if you've delved into this
59:23 Cuban side of things and you start
59:25 enjoying what I believe to be the finer
59:27 side of life and the Cuban experience or
59:30 starting the cigar experience you'll get
59:32 back to some of these new worlds that
59:33 are selling for twenty thirty dollars
59:35 forty dollars a stick and you're like
59:37 you guys are idiots like you are smoking
59:41 essentially coal sticks patting yourself
59:44 on the back like you know anything about
59:46 cigars in fact some of the more
59:48 expensive cigars out there in the new
59:50 world realm are such pepper bombs like
59:54 you'll smoke it in your whole mouth is
59:56 like tingling pepper is one of the most
59:59 inexpensive cliche things to have a
60:03 cigar be dominant
60:04 right now you might get a little pepper
60:06 out of Macanudo but it's it's
60:08 beautifully balanced as an additional
60:10 flavor and not the dominant flavor but
60:13 there are but this way there's a brand
60:16 of cigar out there that sounds a lot
60:18 like patron and it's there nicely made
60:24 but I mean I haven't had one that I
60:26 thought was worth 10 bucks you know so
60:30 if you're brand new to cigars and you
60:33 don't you have your face blown off and
60:34 you want a new world because that's all
60:36 you can get ahold of get a Macanudo and
60:39 just worry free smoke it slowly and to
60:42 build up your rapport again don't hail
60:44 okay
60:45 second you inhale a cigar in most cases
60:48 if you want it you're like a cigar or
60:50 cigarette smoker before it's it'll it'll
60:54 set your lungs on fire so it's a
60:56 beautifully self-regulating art but
61:00 there's a brand of cigarette there
61:02 called Fuente and it's the Fuente family
61:06 and they make probably the finest new
61:10 world cigars on planet Earth their top
61:13 brand / line of cigars is called the
61:16 Opus X and they have several different
61:18 Opus X configurations that I mean
61:21 several they have a Blue Label
61:24 Opus X that is my personal favorite on
61:28 that but honestly any Opus X except for
61:31 the super heavy ones or I don't like a
61:33 lot of strength they're all pretty
61:35 remarkable they have a line of
61:38 inexpensive point a is called the eight
61:41 five-eighths
61:41 I believe there's four different sticks
61:44 inside the eight five eight realm some
61:47 have like the Maduro wrapper which is
61:49 the darker wrapper they have a lighter
61:51 Connecticut wrapper they've got the I
61:53 think it's called the Cameroon the green
61:56 one and another variation of kind of a
61:59 medium one they're all lightweight
62:01 cigars
62:02 one of the biggest misnomers that was
62:05 heavily documented at the turn of the
62:07 20th century from the 18th or from the
62:10 19th to the 20th century
62:11 it's about 1910 or so was that all
62:14 cigars were dark back in the day
62:17 and they weren't all heavy so there's
62:20 this total misconception that a dark
62:22 cigar is going to hit you in the pants
62:24 right now
62:26 some are intensely powerful when they're
62:30 dark and I mean like you can't I can't
62:32 get through an inch of some of these
62:34 cigars the fuente a 5/8 which you can
62:38 get online in a box probably around four
62:40 to five bucks if you bought a box if you
62:42 get them out of a store then anywhere
62:44 from about eight fifty to ten bucks in
62:46 California
62:47 usually closer to 850 I could smoke up
62:50 all day if I had to right because
62:52 they're not heavy the the other nice
62:57 thing is it's just like when you eat
62:59 food how many of you have to eat out
63:02 every day you know you have a lunch
63:04 either your work at home like I do or
63:05 you're you just have to you have to
63:10 leave your company and go out to eat and
63:11 then you have these restaurants and
63:12 you've eaten at all of them and you're
63:13 like god I just don't want to eat any of
63:15 these restaurants anymore that same
63:18 thing happens to your cigar lines so my
63:22 way of combating that in the eating
63:24 realm is to eat it a couple places for
63:27 several days in a row maybe even four or
63:29 five weeks in a row and then when I
63:30 switch it's a special thing and I don't
63:32 go back to the previous one for another
63:34 two or three weeks and then rotating
63:36 through in that realm same thing with
63:38 cigars it just depends on sort of your
63:41 preference of course I personally don't
63:45 like to smoke to amazing aged Cubans in
63:50 a row like two days in a row because it
63:53 is such an amazing experience for me
63:55 personally that to do that every single
63:58 day would eventually get to the point
64:01 where it's not special
64:03 until you back off for a month or so and
64:06 you come back - it'll be a mind-blowing
64:07 experience again I'm in the sweet spot
64:09 on this cigar man it is beautiful
64:11 there's no medicinal flavor whatsoever
64:13 but it is it does have a bit of a
64:15 sweetness to it at this stage
64:17 a chap men are just fantastic steaks
64:21 the taste is almost guaranteed to be in
64:24 a Cuban cigar right I say almost because
64:28 there's there's obviously folks that
64:30 aged cigars improperly I haven't ever
64:35 smoked a cigar right out of the box that
64:37 didn't have a wonderful Cuban go start
64:41 of the hey tobacco flavor like this one
64:42 I'm smoking right now it's just
64:43 fantastic the reason I'm telling you
64:46 that is that you might go and try to
64:48 confirm this information with some of
64:51 your buddies who smoke a lot if you get
64:53 a knee-jerk reaction that Cubans suck
64:56 you can almost always do a little bit of
64:59 poking and prodding around in their
65:01 history and say well what do you smoke
65:03 and they're usually either one of two
65:07 hemispheres you're smoking really cheap
65:10 new-world cigars which the cheaper you
65:12 go the more you get the pepper bombs and
65:14 you're really strong tobacco stuff
65:17 tobacco flavors or you go there smoking
65:20 the higher-end stuff and which is also
65:22 very loud but probably has a lot of good
65:24 body in it and when they switch over to
65:26 the subtlety of a Cuban they don't get
65:29 it for anybody who's like a Macanudo
65:32 addict which they're out there and
65:35 they're pretty expensive cigars because
65:36 they are so well constructed they just
65:38 burn perfectly right go see my cigar
65:41 episode for the anatomy of a cigar and a
65:43 lot of the terminology and what-have-you
65:45 but they're able to move into Cubans and
65:49 experience it typically so the younger
65:52 you are I think the more that you have
65:54 the ability to taste things more
65:56 profoundly you know I'm in my 40s and I
66:00 still taste of Cuban beautifully so I
66:02 think that it just depends on your
66:04 palate of course but you know with cigar
66:08 smoking especially if you hang out
66:10 lounges or around guys who have smoked
66:12 for a long time you know there's this
66:14 clicky thing that can happen with any
66:16 any devotion like that and then people
66:21 say oh you don't want to like that you
66:22 got to like this you know sports teams
66:25 the television shows - what actress is
66:27 hot or whatever it's important that if
66:31 you're going to get into this and
66:32 especially spend the money to be in it
66:34 because it's a devotion right you're
66:36 gonna have to probably unless you're
66:37 really wealthy sidetrack something else
66:40 in your life that cost money to have
66:42 this experience on a routine basis
66:44 ashle on a day-to-day basis and like I
66:47 said in my initial episode on cigars the
66:50 biggest thing that goes on is that
66:52 regardless of how much your closest
66:55 friends smoke they typically will not
66:58 tell you anything about how to do
67:00 something quote-unquote right until you
67:03 screw it up in front of them it's a
67:04 weird thing you know I like to think
67:06 that if you invited your buddy to go
67:09 fly-fishing and he's never been
67:11 fly-fishing that you would have the
67:12 decency to explain it to your friend
67:14 before they try to get out there and
67:16 catch a fish with one of the most
67:18 complex methods on planet Earth right
67:21 so again if you're worried about the
67:24 basics go over to the cigar episode I'll
67:26 definitely put it down in the
67:27 description so you can find it maybe
67:29 I'll do that a little hot link in the
67:30 side the video I never do but that'll
67:34 get you through the basics so that the
67:35 terminologies there the steps are there
67:37 you know how to pick a cigar for
67:39 yourself as there this is the episode
67:42 you watch to understand the investment
67:44 of a Cuban cigar right now once you
67:48 figure out what your palate is and what
67:50 you like whether you like the medicinal
67:51 flavor or not or the bean flavor or the
67:54 hay or the leather or all that stuff
67:55 right once you figure out what you like
67:58 and you find a source to get your Cubans
68:03 especially you guys in Europe you're
68:05 super lucky we've got a couple listeners
68:07 one in I think Edinboro one in Glasgow
68:12 and one in England I'm not sure what
68:15 city he lives in but we have folks that
68:17 can just walk into stores and buy them
68:19 all day long my buddies cigar review
68:22 page slash YouTube channel he also has
68:28 instagram and that kind of stuff if
68:29 you're into that stuff but if you want
68:31 to hear whether or not a cigar is living
68:36 up to the hype
68:37 inside the Cuban realm or not he's a
68:40 fantastic resource he even has videos
68:43 andhe secton counterfeit Cohibas
68:47 now with the counterfeiting just to kind
68:50 of end this on sort of a technical note
68:53 the counterfeiting is just like money
68:56 if something has a really high value it
69:00 gets counterfeited if it doesn't have a
69:01 high value it doesn't get counterfeited
69:03 so one of the beautiful things about
69:05 finding sort of a Cuban cigar or even a
69:08 new world cigar that's sort of under
69:10 that two buck chuck theory and for those
69:11 of you don't know what that means there
69:13 was a a line and I can't remember it's
69:18 called Charles something-or-other and he
69:22 had us he had a bunch of wine he over
69:24 made a bunch of wine in the I believe it
69:26 was the 90s
69:27 maybe the 21st century but I think it
69:29 was in the 90s anyway made a bunch of
69:31 wine couldn't get rid of it they threw
69:34 it out for $2 a bottle just so happened
69:36 the vintage was impeccable amazing
69:40 so everybody rushed out and bought all
69:41 this wine up because they were getting a
69:43 $2.00 bottle of wine it was probably
69:45 worth 30 bucks doesn't happen a lot but
69:49 it happens every once in a while well
69:51 that happens in cigars as well you will
69:53 find some little sleeper wear and it's
69:57 again it's just like the vintage of a
69:59 wine so a cigar made in 2004 could be
70:02 awesome but a cigar made in 2005 by the
70:04 same company has been rebranded they had
70:07 some hurricanes they've had to import
70:09 tobacco from a place they don't normally
70:11 mix their cigars with but in their
70:13 cigars with and it tastes like crap now
70:15 what's nice is is that in my lifetime
70:18 drinking wine I no longer drink it
70:20 anymore but I used to be into it like
70:22 every other person who's into it the
70:26 drastic difference between vintages was
70:30 ridiculous like I the finest wine I
70:32 think I ever had that was below 30 bucks
70:34 was a it was a Cabernet and it's in a
70:38 California vineyard and I just going
70:40 blank on this but the 86 was
70:42 unbelievable
70:43 I stumbled into it the 87 was awful he's
70:48 seven was tannin full of tannins and
70:51 gave you a big headache and it was just
70:53 awful and so it really killed it like I
70:56 never went back to that brand with a
71:00 cigar you typically will not have this
71:03 complete disaster if and even if it's
71:05 got a bad harvest either they won't
71:07 release the cigar in general which is
71:09 very
71:09 or the blend is actually pretty decent
71:11 on a Cuban side of things new worlds
71:14 I've had I had a cigar and I'll leave
71:19 the name out because they may fix this
71:21 and I might meet them one day or
71:23 something but it was the stick that if
71:25 you ever see my season 1 thumbnail I've
71:28 got this stick in my hand and at the
71:31 time I was making season 1 it's like a
71:34 vanilla flavored wrapper it's crazy and
71:38 it's not covered in anything it's just
71:40 it ferments that way it's it was
71:41 beautiful and I smoked box after box to
71:44 that stuff and then about 2 or 3 years
71:46 later when it got SuperDuper popular
71:48 they had must have had a problem because
71:50 they started turning into tar sticks and
71:53 it was just gross the second cigar I
71:56 filmed in my second season it started
71:59 off with like a buttery tip and it was
72:01 just amazing and then it turned into
72:03 like this ashy thing now it's kind of
72:06 halfway between what it was and what it
72:09 is you know in between the bad one and
72:10 the good one so they're kind of
72:12 recovering but that's the excitement of
72:15 finding a really nice cigar brand that's
72:17 it's awesome and you can go in just like
72:20 in a winery you can go into a humidor
72:22 and experiment with cheaper cigars if
72:27 you really want to get under 10 bucks
72:28 and you try it out once you find one
72:29 that you like be smart enough to get a
72:31 box of them and put them away right now
72:34 when it comes to counterfeit Cubans
72:36 especially the Cuban government wants
72:39 you to have Cuban cigars they don't want
72:41 you to buy some crazy new world knockoff
72:43 of their smoke a lot of smoke shops will
72:47 say you a counterfeit cigar you'll take
72:50 it home you'll smoke it you're halfway
72:52 through and you realize this ain't no
72:54 Cohiba and you come back to the
72:57 proprietor and they'll say yeah but was
73:00 it good you know and it might be it
73:03 might be way better than a normal new
73:06 world cigar so it's kind of half between
73:07 New World and Cuban the the idea is that
73:12 he sold you an illegal cigar in America
73:14 so there's no place you can really go to
73:15 say you bought a legal product and say
73:17 you're a part of the crime right which
73:19 is such a ridiculous notion right again
73:21 it's sort of like Amsterdam's drug rule
73:23 we can actually import them in from Cuba
73:26 and smoke them but if you import them in
73:29 and sell them to anybody boy you're in
73:30 jail right it's nuts right so but all
73:34 the boxes from Cuba have a a green sort
73:39 of looks like a money type design label
73:42 on it that actually closes off the box
73:44 lid so the box is sealed but this labels
73:47 underneath the wrapping on the box to
73:50 make sure if you open this thing this
73:51 seal is gonna break on that seal they've
73:54 got a little holograph background and a
73:56 big number on it and you can go to the
73:58 Cuban I forgot the name of the site Dave
74:01 talks about all the time did you go to
74:04 the site at Cuba and the Cuban
74:05 government typed this number in and they
74:07 able tell you what's supposed to be
74:08 inside that box and it is amazing how
74:10 many times that label is forged you'll
74:13 pop it open you're looking at what you
74:16 think is the box that Cohibas but you
74:18 look up the label and it's supposed to
74:20 be a chapman's or something totally
74:22 different right
74:23 now one of the other ways you can get
74:25 Cubans that's a little unorthodox and
74:27 there's some student versions of this
74:31 for those of you travel to Mexico they
74:35 will have a location like a as I'm told
74:40 a bar and inside the bar is a little
74:43 cubic ten-foot place and there's a guy
74:46 there with a bunch of tobacco and he is
74:48 rolling Cuban cigars
74:49 in Mexico the way they talk about this
74:54 is that the Cuban government owns the 10
74:56 foot by 10 foot space that this person
74:59 is working in technically I don't know
75:00 how they pull it off paperwork wise
75:02 seems a little silly you can say that
75:03 but they'll roll roll these sort of
75:07 Mexican Cuban cigars now I've smoked
75:10 dozens and dozens of these things it's a
75:12 very interesting smoke it is by no means
75:15 the traditional flavor that you get from
75:18 a Cuban cigar but it is also much
75:22 improved over new world cigars so it's
75:25 sort of this in-between cigar between a
75:28 typical Cuban proper cigar an annual
75:31 cigar there's also places in foreign
75:34 countries this
75:35 doesn't happen in America because of our
75:37 stupid embargo but I think Canada does
75:40 this there's a bunch of places in Europe
75:42 that do the same exact thing I do not
75:43 believe that they have this weird we own
75:46 the land underneath your feet thing but
75:48 people will buy big bundles of Cuban
75:51 tobacco and they will roll it in your
75:52 backyard
75:53 it's interesting I don't well I guess
75:56 you could do it literally rent them for
75:57 our party so if you have any friends
76:00 traveling abroad outside the United
76:03 States of America they are allowed by
76:06 law by American law now to buy I think
76:10 it's eight hundred dollars worth of
76:11 cigars which in some countries that
76:14 wouldn't be a lot of cigars and some
76:16 countries would be a ton of cigars so if
76:19 you're interested in getting Cubans and
76:20 don't wanna and you're in America you
76:23 can have one of your friends if you have
76:25 a friend that's a flight attendant they
76:27 can easily go into the duty-free shops
76:29 and grab your box or even just a few
76:30 sticks make sure if they're not bringing
76:33 it back in a box that they at least
76:34 bring it back and some cellophane bag
76:36 and then the cellophane bag is and
76:38 stuffed inside some you know
76:40 rough-and-tough suitcase or in a pocket
76:42 or in a backpack or something where it's
76:44 going to get messed around because every
76:46 time a cigar is bumped you run the risk
76:49 of breaking the wrapper and once you
76:51 break the wrapper you could run into
76:53 situations where you'll have again a
76:55 little site chimney other side of your
76:57 cigar the chimneys can be fixed a couple
77:02 different ways you can hold it like a
77:03 flute and literally like pinch the hole
77:05 with your finger every time you take a
77:06 drag if it's closer to the band that's a
77:09 pain in the ass they do make this
77:10 adhesive the same exact I think it's
77:13 some sort of vegetable oil that's it's
77:19 like it's the use of that they use in
77:21 the cigar rolling plants all around the
77:23 world to get the the wrapper to hang on
77:25 and to seal that's how they put the caps
77:27 on right you can buy that in a little
77:31 bottle a little dinky bottle it's about
77:33 half the size of a cinnamon bottle and
77:35 you have to shake it up because it's got
77:37 a sedimentary thing and it you shake it
77:39 up shake it up shake it up you pull it
77:41 out and it's got a little brush just
77:42 like a fingernail polish brush and you
77:44 just brush right over the hole or if
77:47 your wrappers come off you go underneath
77:48 the wrapper and it's
77:49 like glue just put it back down works
77:51 great one of the other things you can
77:54 run into that I don't believe I covered
77:57 in my cigar episode maybe I did but it's
78:00 important for Cubans especially because
78:03 you don't typically know where the
78:05 Cubans come from again if you have a
78:06 friend that goes to Cuba or goes to a
78:09 really nice cigar shop and they're
78:10 taking a direct flight back right they
78:12 didn't buy on the first day stay two
78:14 weeks and then come back to you they
78:17 your your humidification in the cigar
78:20 and the dryness of a cigar can
78:22 contribute to it it becoming so blocked
78:26 from the opening to your to your cap or
78:29 your putting it in your mouth that
78:31 you'll have a block stick in my
78:34 experience when you get a block stick in
78:35 the New World brand you're most oftenly
78:38 dealing with most often dealing with a
78:40 branch like a part of a leaf like the
78:44 stem of the leaf is in there or just
78:46 some objects inside the stick and that's
78:49 a big bummer because it's very difficult
78:52 to correct that problem besides cut your
78:54 stick in half and hoping that one of the
78:55 two halves is not blocked with the Kuban
78:59 if you get a blocked cube then it is 99%
79:02 of the time simply due to its
79:04 humidification and its dryness or / or
79:08 wetness right be a lot of moisture in
79:10 your cigar you basically have water
79:12 molecules blocking the pull the pull on
79:15 a cigar should be effortless I mean it
79:17 should be just like like you barely have
79:20 anything obstructing your breath also
79:24 you until you at least get down to like
79:26 this last third here the smoke should be
79:29 very cool inside your mouth if it starts
79:31 getting really hot and your cigars
79:32 barely burned any you might have a
79:35 tunnel and that's very rare and a Cuban
79:38 but when they roll up those leaps
79:40 they're rolling them in a roll and so
79:42 you can get a little hole inside the
79:45 cigar it's a very rare situation when
79:47 fire goes right down that hole and
79:49 there's very little you can do to stop
79:52 that from burning all the way down to
79:54 where the hole stops right it most
79:57 likely only goes you know maybe a third
79:59 horrible situation two-thirds down the
80:02 cigar
80:03 when you have gone to the labor
80:06 especially in America to get a hold of a
80:07 Cuban cigar you probably want a little
80:10 stick or a little this little tool we
80:14 just want to made in Orange County and I
80:16 can't remember the freaking name of it
80:17 but they're little the little metal rods
80:20 with little razor blades on the end and
80:23 they're jagged towards the pullout so
80:26 it's like an arrowhead very meticulous
80:29 little tiny things but I think once
80:31 called like cleardraw or something like
80:33 that but you if you have a totally block
80:36 stick and you thinking man I can't do
80:37 this my mouse hurting because I'm
80:39 pulling on this thing too much I've got
80:41 a good opening in my cigar you
80:42 guillotine like maybe if you did a punch
80:44 or you got a little hole in there you
80:46 did a V cut and it's it's hard I always
80:49 get out the guillotine and you go ahead
80:50 and chop off you know any tapering on
80:53 the end of the cigar just to make sure
80:54 I'm not struggling with just the tip
80:57 right but you take these little sticks
81:01 these little they're metal and you have
81:03 to be very careful you just push it
81:05 directly in the center of the back of
81:07 the cigar and you need to kind of rotate
81:09 it to make sure you don't go sideways on
81:12 this little this little poker because if
81:15 you go sideways it'll pop out the side
81:16 of your cigar and you've gotta mend it
81:18 really with that glue stuff and but that
81:21 point you've kind of destroyed your
81:22 cigar a little bit but as you're pushing
81:25 it in you just rotate to make sure you
81:27 keep even if you start going off just
81:29 pull it back and kind of readjust it you
81:32 get it all the way till it's at the
81:33 little handle and they're very carefully
81:35 very slowly you pull it up and it's
81:38 gonna take a bunch of this cigar not a
81:41 bunch but it'll take a fair amount of
81:43 the cigar tobacco in the center of your
81:44 cigar and pull it out with poker if
81:47 there's some obstruction in there and a
81:49 new world cigar it typically brings the
81:51 branch with it or whatever is in there
81:53 but sometimes if you are in a rush you
81:58 have time to reunify it and clean it up
82:00 inside your own humidor this is a
82:03 technique to get around it so you get a
82:06 few tools to help you out I think it's
82:09 called perfect draw that's what it's
82:11 called the one made in Orange County a
82:12 year
82:14 but sometimes you'll be you know what
82:17 you want to do is if you get a cigar and
82:19 it's blocked like you got a box and you
82:21 pull one out and it's blocked sometimes
82:23 it's just that stick very rarely it's
82:25 the whole box but at that point you want
82:27 to get it into your humidor if you want
82:31 just normal average humidification and
82:35 temperature you just let it go room
82:36 temperature and you put at 69 degrees
82:40 humidification to about 72 72 is
82:44 starting to become really really popular
82:45 just so that you know 69 was sort of the
82:48 well you know each cigar needs probably
82:51 a little bit different humidification so
82:52 in the middle 69 is good the reason why
82:56 I'm making this video is because once
82:58 you get into it and you get into the
83:01 subtleties of Cuban cigars all those
83:04 dudes that told you that Cubans suck
83:06 they're still your buddies but you don't
83:09 go to them for any more advice right
83:11 because they're hooked on Coors Light
83:13 they hate micro breweries you know they
83:15 would prefer a Big Mac over a burger you
83:20 cook in your backyard you know it's just
83:22 that kind of dude and there it's okay if
83:25 they're that way it's just if you want
83:27 to have something that's more meticulous
83:28 you're spending the kind of money that
83:30 it takes to smoke cigars want to have
83:32 the best experience on planet Earth and
83:33 if you're tenacious you can really find
83:37 unbelievable sticks between ten and
83:39 fifteen dollars American
83:41 so translate that to your currency there
83:45 is a lot of Taxation on cigars because
83:46 they get blamed for being cigarettes any
83:49 item that's a luxury item most countries
83:52 create taxes on those items it's just
83:54 the way to remember the Tea Tax right
83:55 tea is probably the cheapest flavor
83:59 additive to water on this planet and to
84:02 have that cost a lot of money is sort of
84:04 the funniest thing on planet earth right
84:06 you know when you go to a a restaurant
84:10 my buddy used to own a restaurant and
84:12 I'd ask him well I said well how much is
84:14 it to get like a large coke like what
84:16 does it cost you syrup and water and all
84:18 that stuff and he's like about eight
84:19 cents so he goes that's where I make a
84:21 lot of my money is people drinking you
84:23 know something with their meal I said
84:25 what does it cost 40 you know that's
84:28 free
84:28 he goes it takes barely any tea and I
84:30 make a gigantic fat of it and he goes
84:33 maybe a penny or is the biggest drink
84:36 you can possibly get all of so the
84:39 Cubans you want to get your money's
84:40 worth then you know I hope this was very
84:42 useful for those of you who have sort of
84:44 been sitting on the fence you haven't
84:46 smoked in Cuban but you'd really like to
84:48 to know whether or not it's it's worth
84:50 your investment I think it is a hundred
84:53 thousand percent I wouldn't start out
84:56 with a Cohiba because you want that to
84:58 be one you want it to be an authentic
85:00 Cohiba and you want that experience to
85:03 be very rewarding and I think that going
85:08 in and you know it's like there are you
85:12 know there's cameras out there that cost
85:13 a ton of money but you wouldn't want to
85:14 buy it on your first camera because you
85:16 won't appreciate its features men even
85:18 know how to use them same thing with a
85:20 Cohiba right
85:21 I barely smoked a Cohiba you know
85:23 because I find that my mind is
85:26 consistently blown by anything that's
85:28 just simply aged this is not your
85:32 typical deep thoughts episode so if
85:34 you're new to the show that branching
85:36 out do the opposite other episodes is
85:38 going to seem very disorienting if you
85:41 have any further questions
85:42 quite a couple places you could go one
85:45 obviously if you ask me a question in
85:46 the comments section I'll do my best to
85:47 answer your question but if you really
85:51 want to get a super duper expert opinion
85:54 about something definitely go over to my
85:56 buddy Dave show and watch his videos ask
85:59 him questions he's always available to
86:01 answer your queries same thing with his
86:04 Instagram and again he can save you a
86:08 ton of money if you find that your
86:10 palates are similar because he is
86:13 incredibly accurate in my opinion anyway
86:16 if you have them into deep thoughts
86:17 radio.com please go there's audio video
86:19 a lot Facebook group and a patreon page
86:22 the shop is also still there my shirts
86:25 are still available out there pretty
86:27 interesting need to come up with some
86:28 new designs we've got one I'm dreaming
86:31 up right now which would be kind of fun
86:34 I think
