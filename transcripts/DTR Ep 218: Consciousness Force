00:00 [Music]
00:33 afternoon ladies and gentlemen welcome
00:36 back to D Foxx I mean I guess it's good
00:38 morning and good evening too right yes
00:41 the dilemma of that salutation is
00:43 traveled the universe so I got to
00:49 thinking something I love to do and I
00:53 thought up this idea of several episodes
00:58 ago based on some research I did in 2013
01:05 where I tried to model the universe as
01:09 if consciousness is an actual force in
01:12 the universe an intractable force of
01:17 which its behaviors are also entirely
01:19 unknown to us although we might be able
01:21 to derive a little bit about them
01:25 through observing things if you wanted
01:30 to track the mass of the universe and
01:31 the form of energy then there's all
01:34 kinds of methodologies to do that you
01:38 could see a big portion of it you could
01:41 hear a big portion of it you could
01:43 measure with devices that you can see
01:46 what you can't see you know electron
01:49 flows over the valence of a piece of
01:51 conductive metal you can't see it you
01:54 know a lot of us have been shocked at
01:55 our lifetimes because it didn't look
01:57 like it was dangerous until you touched
01:58 it but if you want to track
02:01 consciousness first and foremost the
02:04 paradigm of doing so is almost one in
02:08 which your mind
02:09 utterly rejects the concept what
02:11 consciousness what are you talking about
02:13 conscious
02:13 this is not a forest consciousness is
02:15 really just sort of this theoretical
02:17 model man but think about if I said to
02:20 you okay here's an infinite amount of
02:23 money into the amount of resources you
02:25 must track consciousness not electrons
02:29 that might contribute to the symbiotic
02:33 relationship we have with the
02:34 consciousness in this mortal coil but
02:36 the actual consciousness of the universe
02:38 which is essentially in a way maybe me
02:40 saying I need you to track the soul of a
02:43 human being of an animal maybe you start
02:47 killing animals and you watch this see
02:49 if a little piece of energy comes out
02:51 something you can see see if it alters
02:53 some fabric of the universe such as you
02:56 can say well I can't see consciousness
02:58 but I'm watching a change in the book
03:02 holographic universe and the first half
03:04 of the book he talks about a lot of
03:06 college experiments that had people
03:09 willing themselves onto machines and
03:12 changing their performance changing how
03:14 pachinko balls might fall down the bed
03:17 of a you know pachinko pachinko field
03:20 and it's all random but they had the
03:23 class concentrate to the left
03:24 concentrate to the right the natural
03:27 bell curve of random falling is to
03:28 create a bell curve at the bottom they
03:30 month they mainly find themselves dead
03:32 center well in that particular
03:35 experiment you know according to this
03:38 book you know they in the 60s they did a
03:43 lot of these experiments and they proved
03:44 that there's a bunch of different layers
03:47 to the universe and then it sort of just
03:49 disappeared when Europe moved in
03:51 according to Charlotte is Ruby in about
03:53 1973 to shut down our education system
03:56 to blind us to give us a gigantic
04:00 injection of Prussian education systems
04:03 where you're just bred to obey but now
04:06 what if the universe was really run by
04:08 consciousness you know there's a there's
04:12 one of the first big sci-fi movies to
04:15 really make its mark on the universe is
04:18 the and there's Forbidden Planet 1951
04:21 but in terms of living completely off
04:23 world and being serious and sort of a
04:26 science fiction
04:27 enter you have a movie called Forbidden
04:29 Planet with Leslie Nielsen believe it or
04:31 not as the main character and just a
04:34 star-studded cast it's the cast were
04:35 Robby the Robot debuted and part of the
04:40 plot of this movie is that the previous
04:43 race that lived on the planet that man
04:45 discovered had developed an instrument a
04:48 computer factory of power supplies and
04:53 all these different things and they
04:55 turned it on and it allowed them to
04:57 transfer their consciousness into
05:00 creation such that they didn't need the
05:02 bodies anymore what they called
05:04 instrumentalities to control the world
05:07 and what ended up happening was the
05:09 their consciousness went so nuts because
05:12 it had never been free outside of a body
05:14 and so instead of just coexisting in
05:18 that realm there all their fears and
05:21 anxieties and all that stuff started
05:23 manufacturing things like monsters and
05:27 so we have to unravel a mystery in the
05:29 middle in addition to that story set up
05:32 there's a big mystery as to what's going
05:34 on on that planet so when we think about
05:37 the fact that we have this sort of
05:39 restrictive world the way that we view
05:41 the world today is that we are this
05:44 entity of which accepts information from
05:47 the rest of the universe and so we are
05:49 the receiver of the universe if there's
05:53 a bush over there well I am receiving
05:55 its frequency its energy its
05:57 consciousness and to itself on to me I
06:01 in object-oriented programming I'm an
06:04 object it's an object and we have this
06:06 sort of medium we can exchange now what
06:09 if one of the secrets to the universe is
06:14 that we are more of an eye than a beam
06:20 think of the irony of all the AI
06:23 symbolism you've ever seen in the
06:25 universe right what if we our eyes what
06:29 does that mean well our existence is
06:34 based on our ability to perceive our
06:36 existence and our consciousness is
06:39 essentially the schematic
06:41 workshop and says if philosophy allows
06:44 me to expand what I can see that I can
06:48 see it and therefore it becomes real to
06:51 me there is no out there it is merely
06:57 that I'm in an infinite pool of energy
07:00 and I perceive into existence what I see
07:05 it's very similar to when you close your
07:07 eyes at night in bed what do you see
07:11 well you sure as hell don't see where
07:13 you are right you're seeing what you've
07:19 where you've been you know you might see
07:22 a relative you might see a car you might
07:24 see anything candy
07:27 weird acid trips but you won't see
07:30 something but you can't conceive of most
07:33 likely not until you take acid but now
07:37 what if something like that was true how
07:39 would it change the way that you operate
07:41 in the world on a daily basis well I
07:44 would say this much in terms of being a
07:47 victim of the universe that would change
07:49 wouldn't it whatever you're experiencing
07:52 is what you're perceiving and because
07:53 you buy into a paradigm that you're out
07:56 of control then you tend to maybe enjoy
07:59 the Bliss of a roller-coaster ride on a
08:02 daily basis right what happens when we
08:04 get into rollercoaster will we get
08:05 strapped in and we write it that's what
08:11 we like
08:11 take control please I'm really tired of
08:13 controlling reality now imagine the
08:16 reason why we have to sleep is really a
08:19 matter of being on all the time and I
08:22 know a lot of people say well duh that's
08:24 what sleep is you got to rest but have
08:27 you ever been in a conversation with
08:29 someone that you really admire and read
08:32 a client you're trying to close the deal
08:34 or you're talking to someone famous or
08:35 whatever you're you're the girl you guy
08:37 you want to date or whatever when you
08:39 get done you feel exhausted I mean it's
08:42 like your soul was doing exercises or
08:44 something what if the larger part of
08:47 that is that in order to be alive one
08:51 has to perceive it into existence
08:54 there's nothing out there right this is
08:58 all an apparition now the sad part would
09:01 be if this was true then maybe you're an
09:03 apparition in my own mind or hey you
09:05 know so it you know maybe we're in some
09:09 neural net where we can exchange the
09:12 notion of being in the same place but
09:15 I'll get back to the communal thing in a
09:16 second because we still could be
09:18 individuals and there were hive minding
09:21 this thing together but there's a lot of
09:24 us that are studying dreams right we're
09:25 trying to figure out what the hell
09:26 dreams are why do dreams exist why do we
09:29 have them why don't we have to go to
09:31 sleep makes no sentence your body's
09:34 99.9% active when you're asleep so why
09:38 do I actually have to fall asleep can I
09:40 just rest a little bit what I feel like
09:43 crap if I don't get it
09:45 what are they you know why do we get
09:46 loopy then what are dreams made out of
09:50 well okay so if you're awake and I'm not
09:53 sure what the difference would be
09:54 between being awake and being asleep but
09:58 perhaps being awake is merely turning on
10:01 more of your senses your ability to
10:05 perceive and receive and translate and
10:08 convert and create is 10x what you can
10:12 get in a dream but when you go to sleep
10:14 you still got the meter run you know but
10:17 it's at a quarter mass tenth of a mass
10:20 and so you actually have these
10:21 experiences but because you're not
10:23 actively putting your mind into creating
10:26 continuity in your movie every few
10:29 minutes of changes changes your limbs
10:31 are turned off which is why your limbs
10:32 barely work what do you dream of people
10:37 that you know places that you know well
10:42 because that could be something that you
10:43 held inside your mind when you were
10:45 awake and so there's residual
10:46 frequencies in there that are sort of
10:48 being sorted out and in the end the that
10:52 of what you are perceiving and turning
10:54 into consciousness
10:54 maybe this again this fabric force never
10:58 turns off why would it but you don't
11:02 have yourself completely turned on you
11:05 know if you had ten microphones you got
11:06 one on nine of
11:07 were turned off what I think is
11:10 interesting is that we are living in the
11:12 in the rule of threes and if you're in
11:15 film there's all kinds of rules of three
11:16 they're pretty interesting but the rule
11:18 of three for living beings tends to be
11:21 that you're awake one-third of the time
11:22 or two-thirds of the time and asleep
11:24 one-third of the time and there tends to
11:28 be a first third is to go out and get
11:31 everything done you need done in this
11:32 world the second third is relax and
11:35 contemplate what you did in the first
11:36 third and then the third third the final
11:40 third is one of absolutely disengaging
11:45 from reality there's a lot of you who
11:49 are religious and you believe in prayers
11:52 now I will get into prayers for a second
11:55 this is what this section is going to be
11:57 about but I'm not sure how they work
11:59 either you know there's this kind of
12:03 diametrically opposed opinion about
12:05 prayers and that if your loved ones
12:07 dying in bed and your other friend their
12:10 loved ones dying in bed and yet both
12:12 pray hell you could even pray more your
12:15 relative dies their relative lives it
12:17 would seem as if you're trying to really
12:19 create a cause-and-effect model your God
12:22 cares more about one of you than the
12:24 other or maybe it's the completed verse
12:25 and the one who dot is the one that gets
12:27 to go to heaven first and that's the
12:29 privilege you know depending on what
12:30 religion you believe but I will tell you
12:35 and if you go back to my I guess the
12:37 season two on Law of Attraction
12:40 it's a big deal it's very very real
12:44 people talk about prayers working and I
12:46 think because they've just had a
12:48 dialogue in the comment section and I
12:50 really don't think that there's a
12:51 difference between Law of Attraction and
12:54 prayers and there's been a tremendous
12:57 amount of religions created where they
12:59 insinuate that Law of Attraction is the
13:01 way things work Shirley MacLaine she is
13:07 the older sister of Warren Beatty she
13:10 invented sort of this New Age religion
13:11 in the late 80s early 90s where she said
13:17 look we in the other side and before we
13:19 reincarnate back
13:20 to this world we pick exactly what we
13:24 want to do we pick the difficulty level
13:27 and that's what we do and I don't know
13:31 why there's any benefit to knowing that
13:35 because if that was the case if you
13:38 don't have a mechanism to alter your
13:40 your current frequency and your current
13:43 experiences then knowing what how this
13:45 whole thing works even if she was
13:46 completely true doesn't really you know
13:49 offer much value so I haven't been any
13:51 of her courses she wanted to eat dinner
13:54 with a friend of mine recently which is
13:55 kind of funny but what we need is a
13:58 mechanism of understanding who we are
14:00 today and I'm not saying this is
14:02 anything definitive but I thought that
14:05 just try to crack the egg of maybe okay
14:10 this whole thing is different than you
14:12 think and I'm sure I'm not the first one
14:14 to see this stuff right what keeps
14:17 coming back to me as a frequency of
14:19 truth you know when you think something
14:21 and you get that kind of sour feeling as
14:24 I kind of broken sprocket feeling in
14:26 your chest like and it's not right it's
14:29 not evil it's just not right and then
14:31 you think of another thing in Ellison it
14:33 flows through you like the best cold
14:35 drink on a hot summer day the idea that
14:39 consciousness is a very active force and
14:42 that we are made of it and therefore can
14:45 actually control it it's something that
14:48 keeps reoccurring for me I don't know
14:49 why and I don't think that it's going to
14:53 be easy to try and track this but how
14:55 would you track it well I think that you
14:59 could track it by keeping your eyes open
15:01 and starting to pay attention to what
15:02 occurs and stop writing blank checks and
15:05 making everything that happens for you a
15:08 coincidence one of the things that
15:11 happens to me a lot and I mentioned in
15:12 an episode a long time ago which is when
15:15 you're talking and you use a fairly
15:17 distinct word and then wherever you are
15:21 the television the internet wherever you
15:24 are someone next to you uses the exact
15:26 same word now with a person next to me
15:28 it makes a little more sense because I
15:30 could have infected them or they could
15:31 have infected me with that choice of
15:33 words and we're
15:34 but a pre-recorded television show the
15:37 de Saron Dippet ously been given a start
15:39 point right you push play on that flick
15:41 you push play on HBO go and you're
15:43 forging into an episode of Deadwood or
15:48 West world or something like that and
15:50 then all of a sudden the word you just
15:53 shows the fate of your friend in the
15:55 room comes out and again we're not
15:56 talking about little tiny words you
15:58 might say word like infrastructure you
16:01 know sudden infrastructure comes out I
16:03 was just at my buddies yesterday for
16:04 lunch and I can't remember what word I
16:07 said but I said it and then POW was
16:09 right there in a youtube video that we
16:11 were watching and I was talking about
16:14 subject a and in the video was talking
16:16 about a completely different subject I
16:18 mean completely different subject
16:20 matters and this word pops out I said
16:22 well that happened again and it seems to
16:25 happen to me all the time as if is a
16:27 little part of my brain that is sort of
16:30 dictating almost literal repeats of what
16:34 I'm doing so as I make a word happen
16:37 boom someone says it around me and again
16:39 you know it happens at the smoke lounge
16:43 that I'm at when we watch something at
16:45 night and I'll call it out to my buddies
16:47 I'll say well this is really weird and
16:50 then eventually it has happened so many
16:52 times they're probably three or four
16:53 times that one guy who's very
16:55 inquisitive and very smart he he
16:58 remembers everything and he's like
17:00 because this is really crazy you know
17:03 and it one of them was a proper noun it
17:05 was like you know talking about Ellen
17:09 burr I think or something like that a
17:11 Raymond Burr excuse me talent it's his
17:13 brother remember so if we're to parse
17:19 this if were ever to figure this kind of
17:20 thing out I think one we have to open up
17:22 the paradigm that this could possibly
17:23 happen to us or that week sorry probably
17:26 the opposite right now the other thing
17:29 that I've done quite a bit of research
17:30 on and what I when I say research I
17:33 don't do research like go out and read
17:35 Wikipedia and read some [ __ ] book
17:37 what I'm doing is what da Vinci does
17:39 which is to sit down and use
17:42 just start theories from scratch and use
17:45 the geometry and the mathematics that
17:47 are not up for negotiation and then
17:52 start to parse what this could mean in a
17:54 different light right I give you an
17:56 example there and I've said this I
17:59 believe in the first or second episode
18:01 which is that the human skull is a very
18:04 interesting device because we have this
18:07 superstructure that holds us together
18:09 which is our bones right there's
18:11 beautiful little cartilage joints that
18:13 keep everything from seizing up and so
18:15 we stay pliable my jaw can move you know
18:17 my skull plates don't fuse together
18:20 until it's time but if you think about
18:23 your eye sockets for instance we look at
18:27 eye sockets and we say well they're
18:30 round because your eyeballs are round
18:31 your eyeballs are some of the most
18:33 amazing things in the goddamn universe
18:36 you could look at a galaxy and I think
18:39 the average eyeball on a human being is
18:40 more impressive than the most impressive
18:43 galaxy could possibly see right you have
18:46 this round object which is at this
18:49 multi-layered almost firmament dome lens
18:51 thing in it right it sits inside this
18:54 round socket the bed in which it sits on
18:59 has all your rods and comes your retina
19:03 which catches all these frequencies and
19:06 turns them into chemical electric
19:08 electrical chemical stimulation which
19:10 then routes completely around the back
19:12 of your head onto a upside-down and
19:15 backwards slice of cheese it's five
19:18 layers deep that is your visual cortex
19:21 which of which only 10% is being used
19:24 because there's this line of cells on
19:26 the first layer that for all intents and
19:30 purposes looks like a genetic blocker
19:34 someone looks like they intended to stop
19:38 us from seeing more being enlightened
19:42 right well what could we be seeing with
19:46 the other 90% it's not what this episode
19:49 is about but perhaps the other 90% leads
19:53 us to seeing shockers to seeing auras
19:55 seeing the actual effect of
19:58 consciousness on what we can track which
20:01 is energy light and perhaps a bunch of
20:06 things that are not trackable by
20:08 instruments today so where does my
20:11 research come in because what I told you
20:13 the clinical understanding of how an
20:15 eyeball works well there's something
20:18 very interesting about research that
20:21 they've done in observing something
20:24 versus not observing something when they
20:28 really started getting deep into quantum
20:29 physics and setting packets of energy
20:32 and you're getting down to this idea
20:34 that there's little Quantum's and they
20:36 started shooting light and shooting
20:38 lasers and observing the experiment and
20:40 not observing the experiment they
20:42 noticed that when they observe the
20:43 experiment it's a little bit different
20:45 than when they don't observe it being
20:47 human beings looking at the experiment
20:50 you don't hear about this anymore but it
20:53 was a big deal in the 80s when I was
20:54 just devouring books on the subject
20:55 right well what does that suggest my
21:01 eyeballs have been taught to me as a
21:03 device that receives information that's
21:07 all I'm Todd okay if you study Eric
21:10 Dollard in Tesla one thing you'll
21:12 understand is that our dollar reminds
21:14 you that the way that we are taught that
21:17 we're have access to little electrons
21:20 the gun from The Electric Company to
21:22 wire into your house and make things
21:23 turn on is that you buy a unit of energy
21:25 and then you use it up but you go back
21:26 and buy more and use it up there is no
21:29 concept in our brain that we could
21:31 create a device in our houses
21:32 it is 100% capable of metabolizing out
21:36 of the ether and using a Tesla coil of
21:38 some particular size and infinite amount
21:40 of electricity now what ever talks about
21:43 that well what if your eyeballs have
21:46 been talk to you almost in an inverse
21:49 formula yes they do have electricity to
21:52 your visual cortex and that's how you
21:54 see them that's why if you lose your eye
21:55 you lose your sight in that particular
21:58 eye socket but let's take the notion of
22:02 observing something changes it if
22:05 there's any truth to that at all and I
22:07 haven't personally done those
22:08 experiments but I've heard
22:09 in read several papers on it then that
22:13 would suggest that something is coming
22:14 from our eyes constantly almost like a
22:17 laser out of our eyeballs towards the
22:19 object that we are perceiving we are
22:21 essentially changing the state of the
22:22 universe
22:23 wherever we look the holographic
22:26 universe is all about this consciousness
22:29 perhaps being these energy waves that do
22:32 resonate off other things and then
22:34 changes the state changes the formula
22:37 changes all the numbers that are then
22:39 subtitled into another total now what if
22:42 we look at a skull and a photograph and
22:45 there's no more tissue and it's just
22:48 pure bone and study the cavernous
22:51 container of which holds the eye and if
22:55 you have studied a radar dish you study
22:57 anything that centralizes and catches
22:59 waves if you have a little dish on your
23:01 house for DirecTV or something like that
23:03 you know that a concave shape well pitch
23:08 everything that comes in in multiple
23:10 directions towards the center it's this
23:12 beautiful thing that occurs what if
23:16 there's some sort of element to that and
23:18 again the eye shape of the skull isn't
23:20 exactly shaped and pointed in the
23:24 perfect direction to do this but but
23:25 maybe there's a little bit of a secret
23:27 in this you know I haven't run any
23:28 computer simulations on it and I don't
23:30 mean to assert this as a as a bonafide
23:32 theory but imagine that the way that
23:34 energy falls into your eye socket is
23:36 then projected out from the eye socket
23:40 energy that hits you know goes to the
23:42 front of your skull bounces off the back
23:44 of your skull and comes back out you
23:47 know again you might question well if it
23:48 can go through your skull then it should
23:50 bounce off the front of your skull and
23:51 never go in who knows I don't know if
23:54 anyone's taking the skull and hit it
23:56 with sound waves and watch the way that
23:58 sound bounces into the skull and perhaps
24:00 out the front of the skull just simply
24:03 showing the acoustical of properties of
24:05 a human skull you know when we were more
24:09 I think amoebic in in formation there
24:12 was a bottom and there was a top so I
24:14 talked about in the evolution episode
24:16 the back is exposed to the elements the
24:18 lights coming down perhaps you know
24:21 sediment coming down on you and so you
24:23 all of this sort of strong backbone your
24:25 belly is weak your belly is always open
24:27 this is where you kill many animals
24:29 because it's where the weakest trait a
24:32 crocodile for instance its belly is
24:34 weaker than its back and so when we
24:36 become upright human beings have the
24:38 spine down the back they can take a lot
24:40 of abuse but man you get gutted in the
24:42 front you're gone all right of course
24:44 below our rib cage we're always
24:46 susceptible to being killed right but
24:50 how many of you have heard that little
24:52 secret that if the fob that you use to
24:54 unlock your car is low on power if you
24:57 put it to your temple or some people put
25:00 it to their chin it can reach the car in
25:03 the parking lot and then lock it it can
25:05 open the garage door and what we've
25:08 discovered is is that it resonates using
25:10 the shape of your skull and it focuses
25:13 the beam straight towards your car so
25:16 they say look at your car put your
25:17 followed to your temple and pop it and
25:20 there goes the [ __ ] door I've done
25:24 this several times after I found out
25:25 about two years ago and my jaws on the
25:28 ground once that occurred to me I
25:31 thought oh my gosh the human body is an
25:35 amazing acoustic creation in addition to
25:38 everything else that it does well if you
25:42 go over to the Hindu side of things and
25:43 you talk about chakras and you go to the
25:45 Egyptians and the Buddha's Buddhist
25:47 excuse me and you talk about your glands
25:50 catching sort of the spiritual energy
25:53 you know the temples in Egypt are
25:55 ridiculously humanoid you know they've
25:58 built the chamber of the mind the
26:00 chamber of the chest the gut and then
26:03 they start splitting the temple into two
26:04 segments at the end with one of the
26:06 wings going off in an angle symbolizing
26:09 the walking leg of a person they were
26:11 totally into this the pillar count in
26:14 the chest cavity is the same count of
26:17 either male or female chest you know how
26:20 many ribs we have they were completely
26:23 into this chakra it begs the question of
26:28 whether or not the Egyptians could see
26:30 more perhaps their visual cortexes
26:31 weren't genetically limited
26:34 maybe we organically grew them
26:36 for some reason maybe the people that
26:40 had the limit were more brutal and less
26:42 sympathetic and they killed the people
26:44 that were who knows it's safe to say
26:47 whoever built the pyramids that race is
26:49 gone or diluted so badly
26:52 we don't have pyramids anywhere in the
26:54 world or anyone trying to build them
26:55 right but what I want you the reason why
26:59 go through this exercise with you is the
27:03 human body may just be this beautiful
27:06 orchestrated frequency catching device
27:09 and this is not going to be a big
27:10 surprise for a lot of you who've already
27:11 studied this kind of thing we went
27:13 through the whole thing with you know
27:16 the DNA being shaped like an antenna
27:17 long hair has been documented now by the
27:21 military to be a more consciousness
27:26 awareness device where they had Native
27:29 Americans that were used to track
27:30 enemies because they had long hair and
27:32 they wouldn't cut it as a matter of
27:34 their religion was they also used the
27:37 Navajo to speak on radios because the
27:40 Germans didn't know anything about
27:41 Navajo language right and not the
27:44 Japanese I guess but how many of you
27:48 have studied the golden mean right the
27:51 Fibonacci pattern and you look down at a
27:54 plant like a cactus or something and you
27:57 know it's rose petals of everything it's
27:59 everything is in a rotational spin and
28:02 you look at that you go wow you know
28:06 everything seems to have a spin to it
28:09 remember my episode on ether inside of
28:12 gravity the gravity episode excuse me
28:14 where everything is a current currents
28:16 are a natural thing that happens when
28:18 you have a pretty damn dense set of
28:21 particles that are all compatible with
28:23 each other in size which means they can
28:24 hate each other if you want your River
28:27 go down the water go down a river excuse
28:30 me it's pretty uniform you know there's
28:32 waves and stuff but you don't see your
28:35 current spinning vortex until the water
28:37 hits a rock it's the coastline it's the
28:40 support beam of a bridge and it begins
28:42 to spin well as it is above so too it is
28:47 a below right so you actually have this
28:49 then algorithm and because of vortex you
28:52 know goes to this mathematical
28:55 condensing process would actually gains
28:57 velocity and it's it's its area of spin
29:02 starts to shrink when you look at an
29:04 area graph this is what we see an
29:08 organic life that life that tends to
29:13 metabolize itself has a Fibonacci
29:15 pattern of some kind now when it's
29:18 compressed inside of a leaf with the
29:20 leaf is starting to constrain it in a
29:22 plain existence you start having the
29:24 Fibonacci pattern pop out and when a
29:27 vein will split when a branch grows a
29:29 sub branch there's incredible
29:32 consistency in the fractal patterns of
29:34 life now man shapes things right the
29:39 awning thing whatever the hell this
29:41 thing is over my patio man has cut down
29:44 trees which grew naturally using these
29:46 Fibonacci patterns and we've now cut it
29:49 shaped it painted it you know or maybe
29:51 maybe there's a little you know termite
29:54 resistance stuff on it and then they
29:56 nailed it together bolted it together
29:57 and so for now this organic mass no
30:01 longer has this life energy flowing
30:03 through it like it did before life as we
30:05 would track it and it's going to be this
30:08 thing until it gets knocked down and
30:10 reconstituted into dust and then it goes
30:12 off and gets recycled right you know
30:16 human beings died are we going to the
30:17 ground we get cremated whatever we get
30:19 recycled our bodies get recycled but
30:23 what about the force that made us exist
30:25 does that go away
30:27 no no one even can test the fact that
30:30 the physics around you and I forget a
30:32 bunch of the bat pop science physics
30:35 unless I'm making fun of the physics
30:38 intercepts in any my episodes I'm
30:39 talking about the physics that perhaps
30:40 we haven't discovered or the physics
30:43 that is not up for interpretation
30:46 especially the mathematics that
30:48 contribute to the overall behavior of
30:51 collisions and ricochets and all that
30:53 kind of stuff right so we let's go to
30:56 the next level years because if we talk
30:58 about you know the physics and
31:00 mathematics of the world and we're
31:01 talking about how things
31:03 sort of bump into each other and you
31:05 know if you've got these crazy pop
31:08 scientists trying to tell you that
31:09 there's actually you know gravity which
31:14 pulls you know mass pulling against mass
31:16 when there's nothing like that at all
31:17 the most that could happen is the
31:19 illusion of a pole created by a bunch of
31:21 pushing right but the mass that makes us
31:25 up manages to get in some sort of
31:28 intelligent configuration by which I can
31:30 talk it goes into the mic gets recorded
31:32 you get to hear later right you're all
31:34 familiar with that
31:35 but now consciousness how would it
31:39 genetically be different than sort of
31:42 inorganic matter as much as you might
31:45 say a plant exists and that sort of
31:47 thing it is organic because for us we
31:50 classify mass differently if it happens
31:53 to host what we would term as life what
31:58 if we stop saying life and we say
32:01 consciousness in place of life it would
32:06 certainly change the profile of most
32:09 vegetarians and vegans right this idea
32:12 that you can put your pillow head down
32:14 your pillow at night and say I am not
32:15 killing things oh yeah you are yes you
32:19 are you know you know and again I don't
32:23 you do whatever you want whatever works
32:25 for you if you die early because you
32:28 choose a bad regiment of food I guess
32:32 that little thought pattern will
32:33 disappear with you you know but we say
32:36 okay if a just a morally split this
32:38 because we're going to take the
32:40 different view of it as consciousness a
32:42 lot of people will say if a plant bears
32:45 fruit it has dropped an apple and the
32:48 Apple is just going to simply die on the
32:49 ground so why not eat it where's the
32:50 Synod net right well all that is in my
32:54 mind is an accelerated version of what
32:56 happens when a cow has a calf and then
32:59 we raise it and it's going to die too
33:02 just like the Apple the only difference
33:04 is we're going to hasten that death by
33:08 eating it right I'm sure it's a bummer
33:11 you got a you got a heap what's on this
33:13 planet but the creators who put this
33:15 place together
33:17 seem to have made an ecosystem of food
33:20 for everything else on the planet we
33:22 don't go out and read the riot act to a
33:24 mountain lion for eating the bunny right
33:27 and supposedly we have gained so much
33:29 sentient self-awareness that we
33:33 shouldn't want to do that anymore it's
33:35 kind of funny to me but anyway but if
33:38 you replace it with consciousness then I
33:42 think death means a completely different
33:43 thing to you when you use Plato as a
33:48 child or clay as an adult and you craft
33:50 something out of it and you have a
33:52 choice when you're done crafting it
33:54 Plato you just let it dry most people
33:57 don't let it dry because it kills the
33:58 play-doh you squeeze it back into a ball
34:00 stick it back in the can done with clay
34:04 you have a choice you stick it in the
34:06 kalam and fire it or you destroy it and
34:09 you go back into creating another thing
34:11 with the clay there's no guilt there's
34:14 no problem it's this creative process
34:15 and you keep getting better and better
34:17 at the process right a couple things to
34:21 parse here if I held up a big ball of
34:24 clay and I said what is this you're
34:25 gonna tell me it's clay just like I've I
34:28 said there's a still water in a pond
34:31 what is this stuff and can I hold up on
34:33 my hand I drop it and hold it up manage
34:35 iviewgle it's water okay I take you to a
34:40 current and a river
34:41 it's very formidable it's like some one
34:43 foot diameter vortex that's spinning
34:45 like 2 or 3 feet down into the into the
34:48 riverbed and I say what's that you're
34:50 going to go well that's a current be
34:51 careful man it'll kill you all right if
34:55 I take the clay and I mix it and I and I
34:58 push and prod it and all of a sudden it
34:59 becomes a pitcher that you put you know
35:02 watering or a cup or something I say
35:05 what's that and you'll say well that's a
35:07 pitcher that's a cup and I could say to
35:09 you know it's actually clay it's
35:12 actually clay the only difference is
35:15 when you fire it it's not going to be
35:17 anything but what it is and if you break
35:19 it well it's going to have to be ground
35:21 back down to become anything else and
35:23 I'm not sure you can take dried clay
35:26 fire clay it's been thermalized and
35:28 hardened and make it pliable again I
35:31 you can crush it up back into dust put
35:32 water back on it it's okay I don't I
35:34 don't know if that's possible but
35:37 obviously whatever makes us up we get to
35:40 keep ourselves for a little while we're
35:42 borrowing this you know collection of
35:44 energy particles which could just be
35:47 again a bunch of ether wind caught in
35:49 some vortexes we get to borrow it for a
35:51 few years few decades maybe a century
35:53 for lucky and then we go back into the
35:55 ground but if we were to say the
35:58 consciousness is what we really are
36:00 we're not our bodies then we don't fear
36:05 death as much as a person who thinks
36:09 this is it an atheist person who
36:13 believes in heaven and hell in this wild
36:14 Judgment Day this [ __ ] Marvel comic
36:16 of the universe right all right it
36:20 doesn't mean that this is this life
36:21 should be trivialized it doesn't mean
36:23 that anyone should go off and just kill
36:24 people willy-nilly there's one thing I
36:26 forgot to mention in the episode the
36:29 last episode in which I talked about
36:31 this and I cannot remember which one it
36:32 is but you know I have a suicide episode
36:36 way back in season one which has been
36:39 fairly effective for some people that
36:40 have gone through this whole thing but
36:42 you know in that episode I tell a story
36:44 about when I was I think about 23 years
36:46 old and I you know I attempted to kill
36:50 myself in a very funny kind of way and
36:54 the one thing that happened to me that
36:57 I'm not even here in the episode I was
36:59 very clear about I was sitting on I was
37:01 living in a studio apartment and I'm
37:03 sitting on the edge of my bed and I got
37:04 about three feet between my bed and a
37:06 sliding glass door to my patty on the
37:08 first floor
37:09 got TV in front of me my kissing to the
37:11 right closet bathrooms again it's a
37:13 20-foot square and I remember the floor
37:16 just dropped out I drink a pretty good
37:20 handful of sleeping pills which is
37:22 hilarious because it was the worst
37:23 tasting shut up Leonard took one gulp
37:25 bone threw it all away it was the
37:26 coolant I was like god this is stupid
37:28 really stupid and I learned this huge
37:32 lesson which has stayed with me for the
37:33 rest of my life you know once you have a
37:35 kid you can't play those games anymore
37:37 right
37:40 for sure I'm sitting on his bed and this
37:44 floor drops away and the conscious
37:46 thought I had that came into me at that
37:48 point which was sort of given to me from
37:50 outside is essentially if you die right
37:53 now this is where you're going and it
37:57 wasn't a fire-and-brimstone thing it was
37:59 a void and it was it was almost sort of
38:04 a cautionary thought that said it's not
38:07 that you won't live again it's just your
38:10 opportunity to live again might be a
38:13 long time from now and what I'm about to
38:18 say is my inference on top of this
38:20 statement 100% that last statement was
38:24 an inference my deduction and my sort of
38:27 thought process of what it meant but the
38:29 message was clear if you do this this is
38:31 where you're going to go and it was like
38:32 this bottomless pit if you've ever seen
38:34 the movie Time Bandits at the very end
38:36 they're running around on this maze and
38:37 there's like this bottomless pit around
38:39 the maze which is always sort of a
38:41 terrifying concept right but I got this
38:44 kind of distraught the feeling which
38:46 said it takes a lot of effort to get you
38:50 into this form which I don't know why
38:54 that would make any sense
38:55 but that's the kind of feeling I got and
38:57 it's one of these things if we work hard
38:58 to get you here and it could be just the
39:01 lineage of my family and their
39:02 consciousness form saying come on now
39:04 we've made a lot of great choices to
39:06 make sure you look the way you look at
39:07 the brain that you have we've been
39:09 nurturing every step whispering in your
39:11 ear there's all these wonderful things
39:13 we have planned for you and if you give
39:16 up on us just like giving up on a
39:17 business venture but if you've been have
39:19 been in a business with somebody and
39:20 they got a partner that gave up boys
39:22 very few things in life that's more
39:24 frustrating than that because you have
39:26 to pick up the slack right it just gave
39:29 me this feeling that being alive in this
39:31 particular form is a coveted experience
39:33 that requires effort requires a whole
39:36 history of your family you know what's
39:39 fascinating about every single one of us
39:41 is that you have a family tree now most
39:44 of us are related to each other less
39:47 than 200 years back we have a cousin we
39:50 have a relative that is together that's
39:52 why when they always feed you that line
39:53 of bull
39:54 your little Bhama and George Bush are
39:56 cousins that's the cabal it's like well
39:59 they went back 15 goddamn generations to
40:02 get these guys related to each other
40:03 give me a [ __ ] break at some point
40:05 that's going to happen for every single
40:07 one of us 15 is actually really far back
40:11 there all right that's almost negligibly
40:13 saying you're a human and he's a human
40:15 so you're related if you can get it in
40:16 four generations back or six generations
40:19 back then you really are damn near
40:21 cousins you could you could say you know
40:23 we might even have a part of our body
40:25 that looks the same but I did an episode
40:28 on existentialism in season two I am
40:31 fairly proud of that episode
40:33 one of the things that occurred to me
40:34 just sitting on this patio I didn't plan
40:36 anything like I never do which is what
40:40 if the greatest secret of the universe
40:42 is that you participated in its creation
40:43 and you participate in your own destiny
40:45 but no one's ever told you this episode
40:50 is sort of the metaphysics behind that
40:52 assertion to say recognize that
40:56 consciousness could exist we obviously a
41:01 lot of us think it does exist because we
41:02 have this added extra ability to think
41:06 therefore I am sort of experiences but
41:10 the rocks over there in my garden don't
41:12 seem to be writing too many novels or
41:14 screenplays or software they're not
41:17 doing too many episodes on YouTube so
41:19 there's a definite difference between
41:20 the collection of energy that is holding
41:23 that thing together and the collection
41:24 of energy that's holding me together
41:27 organic life is usually some sort of
41:30 designation with not only its its
41:32 biochemical signature but its ability to
41:35 manipulate and metabolize energy in a
41:38 sort of food source becomes extrusion
41:41 waste product format in that realm a
41:46 flute would be a living being because
41:49 you blow air into it you channel it to
41:51 create a sound and then it exhausts out
41:52 the music interesting right when you
41:58 take acid sometimes you get this
42:00 overwhelming appreciation that just
42:02 happens to you which is that you start
42:05 seeing everything that is classified as
42:08 Organic having a much more profound an
42:11 equal role with human beings biblical
42:14 folks might not see this as clearly as
42:16 other folks but if I had to ask you you
42:21 know I put this machine on you it's
42:23 going to take your life if you get
42:25 answer wrong and all I'm asking you to
42:27 do is listen to your soul listen to your
42:30 consciousness listen to the frequency of
42:32 right and wrong and you're more than
42:34 welcome to say out loud anything
42:37 eventually when you check the checkbox
42:39 and you say my final answer then we
42:41 judge you so you can play around as much
42:43 as you want until you give me your final
42:44 answer and I ask you which one do you
42:47 think has been on earth longer plants or
42:50 animals just give it a big thought
42:54 especially if you're a vegan or
42:55 vegetarian tell me do you think a
42:57 rosebush came after a saber-toothed
42:59 tiger did a fern come before dinosaurs
43:02 or after dinosaurs did dinosaurs even
43:05 exist we should do an episode on that
43:07 shouldn't we if plants are truly the
43:11 first level of consciousness that we've
43:13 ever had because they can metabolize
43:14 energy in the universe just like we do
43:18 the reason why we feel so righteous and
43:21 eating them and killing them and mowing
43:23 them and all this other stuff is because
43:25 they don't talk to us on a level that we
43:28 can understand now some people are big
43:32 into green thumb botanists and they were
43:34 the plant people and they talked to
43:35 their plants and then plants are healthy
43:37 and then they miss a couple weeks of
43:39 talking to their plants providing all
43:41 the same nourishment that the plant
43:42 normally gets and the plant starts to
43:44 wither and then they talk to it again
43:45 and it starts to spruce back up for
43:49 those people they have no problem
43:50 understanding what I'm saying again
43:52 there was a I should look this guy up
43:54 again but there was a famous King and
43:56 our Duke or something in the Europe that
44:00 came to the conclusion that life and a
44:03 plant it's just a sacred his life and a
44:05 human being and he refused to tend his
44:07 garden and so he had you know six-foot
44:10 grass everywhere as the rumor went but
44:13 everything just got super overgrown and
44:14 he kept saying look the more that it
44:16 over grows my kingdom the more that I'm
44:18 convinced that I am right
44:20 this stuff isn't live and I have no more
44:23 right to kill it than another human
44:25 being now what do you eat I'm not sure
44:28 but I think that even if you subscribe
44:30 to biblical creation alien creation or
44:33 evolution creation you have to put us as
44:36 a fairly recent invention I mean that's
44:39 official science all right official
44:40 Sciences we are one of the last things
44:42 to be created it's very interesting by
44:45 whatever means you might adopt if you're
44:50 religious then it becomes even there's
44:51 an even another moral dilemma on top of
44:53 it to say did God personally choose us
44:57 last and if he did then why did he
44:58 choose us last and where do we rank in
45:00 the system
45:01 of course religions will always make you
45:02 think you know human beings are a number
45:04 one and I would say that the way that we
45:06 communicate is pretty superior to
45:10 everything else that's out there right
45:11 plenty of animals out there to seem to
45:13 be very intelligent as well
45:15 we don't speak dolphin and you know
45:18 gorillas are still learning sign
45:19 language one of the experiments I did
45:22 that I think I mentioned in one of the
45:23 episodes but since we're on this is good
45:25 to plagiarize my own stuff and kind of
45:27 put it into a focal point so you guys
45:29 can start experimenting with this
45:31 yourself and there's nothing more fun in
45:34 my opinion and to hear some concept and
45:37 then see the world in a completely
45:39 different light maybe forever maybe for
45:44 a couple days you know having pioneered
45:47 this in my own brain in 2013 I will say
45:49 that I haven't been able to maintain
45:51 this on a daily basis but I used to go
45:54 to the beach and I eat this food across
45:58 the street and I come across the street
46:00 with my little book and I was just
46:01 literally observing and writing and
46:03 connecting dots and all this other stuff
46:04 from months on end I had to take a break
46:07 after my game company had to shut down
46:11 and I came up this concept that you know
46:14 consciousness may be the overwhelming
46:16 part of the universe that we are
46:18 actually more interested in because
46:20 we're made of it again nothing terribly
46:23 profound about that but what I started
46:25 doing is I'm sitting on the beach and I
46:27 would start sitting on the beach
46:28 anywhere from one o'clock to 3 o'clock
46:30 and I would sit there for so many hours
46:33 that the
46:33 Kru would move in you know people that
46:35 came with their drum circles and other
46:37 stuff and so what I ended up doing was
46:39 saying everywhere I see human being I'm
46:41 just going to put sort of that matrix
46:43 kind of cloud of energy where they are
46:46 and my brain I try to subtract out the
46:48 physical form the arm heal and all that
46:51 kind of stuff and if you were to put it
46:54 in a computer simulation you would
46:55 essentially render the world which you
46:59 would might say the inert mass in the
47:01 universe does you know the stairs the
47:03 ground all that stuff chairs and then in
47:06 a very glowing color start to portray
47:09 energy as the human forms and then just
47:13 you know give it a little bit of what
47:15 they might call stick-to-itiveness right
47:17 there's a little bit of tension almost
47:20 like when you bring two two drops of
47:22 water together and they start saying
47:23 they sort of married each other and they
47:25 start sharing their their outer tension
47:27 and they become one water drop it's like
47:29 when you see a water drop go down glass
47:31 right it starts blending with all the
47:32 other water drugs so when I would see
47:34 two lovers walking down they'd be
47:37 connected a father and a son or father
47:39 and a daughter mother son mother
47:40 daughter all these things friends
47:41 shaking hands giving each other a hug or
47:43 something like that the drum circle
47:44 which then uses the cadence of sound to
47:48 synchronize their brains to come
47:49 together for this mutual experience
47:51 right it was pretty fascinating
47:54 realization but now let's take that in
47:58 your brain reduce this down to
48:00 consciousness sort of clouds and then
48:04 say to yourself well how do we sort of
48:10 transmit energy or transmit knowledge
48:12 between us now obviously we can use our
48:14 bodies and these phonetic words I can
48:17 say something you hear it Yury
48:19 metabolize sort of this this messenger
48:22 protocol which is English language into
48:27 perhaps even your proprietary language
48:29 what if you're watching me from Denmark
48:31 and you don't speak English on a daily
48:32 basis but you understand it and so
48:34 you're translating it into your thought
48:36 process it's just like the Internet you
48:39 know using tcp/ip protocol you're
48:42 transmitting information and perhaps
48:44 even a
48:45 some encrypted binary but when it gets
48:47 to your desk and it goes on your
48:49 computer your phone your laptop your
48:51 tablet and it looks like a picture of a
48:53 walrus if you look at the data stream it
48:56 doesn't look back like that at all
48:58 so how I'm gonna loop back to the
49:01 original the original assertion which is
49:03 perhaps we are perceiving everything
49:05 into existence and it doesn't really
49:07 exist but then that calls into question
49:09 are you a unique person or am i unique
49:13 person are you perceiving me in your
49:16 life and I'm really not there I think
49:19 I'm here but wouldn't you assume that I
49:22 would say that anyway I love the concept
49:25 that macro matches micro as it is above
49:30 so - it is a below so - it is below I
49:33 love that notion because it simplifies
49:36 the overall ecosystem of everything in
49:39 the universe everything goes in a loop
49:41 it is only perceived as macro and
49:44 there's only perceived as micro it is
49:47 the same stuff you know you can take a
49:50 small object of marble hold it in your
49:53 hand hold it as far away from your body
49:55 as you possibly can and but you're like
49:56 boy that it really is a marble and then
49:58 you can hold that thing as close as you
50:00 can on your eye maybe you can put a
50:01 little magnifying glass thing in your
50:03 eye and look at it Jesus looks like a
50:05 whole universe inside that day pretty
50:08 interesting right but everything is made
50:11 of perhaps a bunch of particles
50:15 what if consciousness organizes itself
50:18 in a very similar manner I like the
50:21 model of the neurons inside of a human
50:23 brain a sticky cell that is unique to
50:25 all the other cells in your body that
50:27 shape like little suitcases that divide
50:29 during mitosis right you've heard me go
50:33 on and on in the show about how neurons
50:36 replicate due to overuse I won't repeat
50:39 that now imagine that we are organized
50:42 somewhere in this universe and some did
50:43 you know infinitely dense compacted form
50:46 in which we have a very similar
50:48 situation and the big concept that has
50:53 really dawned on me and I think it's
50:55 because the scientists of the world have
50:56 started to use
50:57 this term more often educate me
50:59 personally on it which is this notion of
51:02 information that transfers from point A
51:04 to point B now when I say new and email
51:08 I'm typing up a bunch of symbols you get
51:11 saved as a text file the text file gets
51:13 shipped in bits over a wire gets
51:15 rewritten into a text file then your
51:17 device reads the text file shows it to
51:19 you and then we transmit our information
51:21 chatting is the exact same way okay if
51:25 the universe flows like water which I
51:30 believe it does that's where you get the
51:32 spinning vortex that's where you get a
51:35 thorough vortex is turning into
51:36 perceivable atomic designations like
51:39 protons electrons neutrons even photons
51:42 photons might be a slightly different
51:44 thing let's break on that for one second
51:47 your electron is supposed to stay in its
51:49 orbital pattern the dielectric and
51:52 magnetic forces bang into each other and
51:54 where they collide there's
51:55 electromagnetic force and that is where
51:57 you have an electron but it stays pretty
51:59 localized to its overall gravity well
52:01 but a photon is amazing a photon is sort
52:05 of a transverse wave of reaction you
52:08 know it's like when you take your
52:09 bedsheet and you flip it and you see
52:11 that wave go down your bedsheet or you
52:13 take a rope and you flip it it goes down
52:15 there
52:15 imagine that the apex of the curve being
52:18 simply what we would recognize as a
52:20 photon when you study LEDs one thing
52:24 that's interesting about our LEDs work
52:25 as you've got a electron coming off of a
52:29 particular surface and it is kicking out
52:32 of itself the reaction that becomes a
52:35 photon of which you can see most likely
52:38 you're viewing me right now through an
52:40 either an oh le D or an LED if you're
52:43 seeing me right will imagine there's
52:46 some similarity between our human
52:49 consciousness creates information
52:51 packets and transmits it from one person
52:53 to another now there are two types of
52:57 waves that we really recognize in the
52:58 universe and I talked about this before
53:01 but there is an interesting realization
53:05 which is there's a transverse wave that
53:08 takes time to travel it's the wave
53:10 you're
53:11 surfboard jumps on and you take time to
53:15 get to the shore transverse waves can
53:18 take you out to the ocean kill you
53:19 but there's something called
53:21 longitudinal waves longitudinal waves
53:24 it's like when I hold a broom pole made
53:26 of wood you hold it on your end and I
53:29 jab you with it one inch and
53:32 instantaneously you feel on your end the
53:35 information is transmitted immediately
53:37 from my hand to your hand immediately
53:40 because everything is so dense it's a
53:43 cause and effect model that just happens
53:46 what I think is interesting is and we've
53:49 talked about it before but people will
53:51 sense things are happening in the
53:53 universe or our planet I should say a
53:56 father might sense his father or mother
53:59 might sense what's happening to their
54:00 children or their or their spouse
54:02 someone that you love some that you may
54:05 actually have a genetic connection to
54:07 because when you are in love with
54:10 someone or especially when you've given
54:12 birth to someone you have this wild
54:15 connection with them you ever think it's
54:20 interesting how Mother's seldomly
54:22 families it happens but it's not as
54:24 common as men walking away from the
54:26 family somehow a man can get to a point
54:29 where he can rationalize I don't like my
54:32 wife I don't like my kids or a donee not
54:34 anything personal against them but I'm
54:35 overwhelmed I just got a split when you
54:38 get all these kids without fathers but
54:41 the mother always sticks around and
54:43 there always seems to be this well
54:45 understood the very very seldom analyzed
54:48 connection between a mother and a child
54:50 well what if okay going back to our
54:54 consciousness model the information that
54:57 traveling between a mother and a child
54:59 has always been on because they shared
55:01 nine months of establishing this
55:03 frequency this connection this
55:05 essentially consciousness cable this
55:09 Ethernet cable if you will between the
55:11 two of them you know I was in a car
55:15 wreck in when I was 18 years old I was
55:18 fine I described it just a few episodes
55:20 back my mother called me that night and
55:22 left a voicemail on my voicemail while
55:25 while the accident was being cleaned up
55:26 she's calling my apartment and leaving a
55:28 voicemail when I got home she said I
55:30 just got this really weird feeling I
55:31 wanted to make sure you're okay
55:33 immediately I thought of Elvis's mother
55:35 calling him when he was in a car
55:37 accident and this has happened a bunch
55:38 of times when Mother's know what happens
55:40 to their child they just get this
55:42 overwhelming feeling well even though my
55:44 mom at the time was 1800 plus miles away
55:48 she seemed to get the message virtually
55:51 instantly if it was a transverse wave it
55:54 must have traveled quick but it seems to
55:57 be a second something happens to me she
55:59 realized it now there are also examples
56:04 in my personal life where it would seem
56:05 that the people I'm dating people on the
56:09 love with or relatives or friends or
56:12 whatever they don't know anything's
56:14 happened to me at all until I walk in
56:17 the room and when I walk in the room boy
56:18 I read my body language they're feeling
56:20 me if I'm trying to push a smile on my
56:22 face it ain't work and they know and
56:26 because they know I'm pretty much an
56:27 open book dude they'll go is everything
56:29 all right
56:30 it's sort of a very cool thing about the
56:33 universe
56:33 if you dig this show then we're alike
56:37 most likely at least in some very
56:39 important areas sure you might be a
56:42 Christian and I don't believe in that
56:43 but doesn't matter we're both going for
56:45 the same thing which is a better world
56:47 is it important that we see these higher
56:55 end concepts that you know that may be
56:56 true may not be true I think the answer
57:01 for me and maybe for you is that we sort
57:03 of owe it to ourselves to ask the
57:05 questions to see if something's there
57:09 and let me ask you this question how
57:12 many times have you read sort of
57:14 anthropological studies about past
57:17 civilizations and you hear about this
57:19 atomistic era where spirituality and
57:21 humanity were essentially one the tribe
57:25 said yeah we can see that those who have
57:27 passed and that's why we develop rituals
57:30 of praying to them and sacrificing food
57:32 to them right again
57:33 the Egyptians would put food trays out
57:35 and as the food deteriorated which we
57:37 call rotting
57:38 they believe that the spirits that are
57:41 pure consciousness are eating somehow
57:43 the life force that's actually in the
57:45 plant and that's why all food
57:47 deteriorates that might be true that may
57:49 not be true but it's interesting that
57:52 they live sort of this unified life
57:55 between the two realms and of course
57:56 today there's no such unification
57:59 whatsoever you know some of you might
58:02 believe in ghosts but even the folks
58:03 that I talked to that believe in ghosts
58:06 it's usually an abstract person it's not
58:08 your family member that's coming back to
58:10 visit you now I've got plenty of friends
58:11 of mine that have said that relatives
58:13 had come back and said something I've
58:15 had that experience myself my
58:17 grandmother died you know at 12 o'clock
58:20 noon and she said I'm I'm I'm on the
58:22 other side and I'm okay I just want you
58:23 to know and then two o'clock that
58:25 afternoon my mom calls and says that she
58:27 died I'm a person who has never seen a
58:31 ghost in my life you know and she wasn't
58:34 a ghost in my room or anything but she
58:35 was sort of in my mind's eye when I was
58:37 waking up in the morning very
58:39 interesting right well if I have any
58:41 connection with anyone on planet earth
58:43 that would be with my grandmother's more
58:45 than anyone else I want to also mention
58:48 before I close up here that you know
58:50 that the end goal of mankind has always
58:54 been to live forever right we don't want
58:56 to die
58:56 and some folks aren't so into that but I
59:00 think most people are we worried about
59:02 being narcissistic when we say certain
59:05 things but I don't really think that
59:06 that some I don't think that's a
59:09 paradigm of judgment in the other realm
59:11 I don't think there's any sense of that
59:12 arrogance especially if you're reduced
59:14 out of this world where the metrics by
59:17 which you would define narcissism no
59:20 longer exist if you're in pure spirit or
59:22 form where you where do you come up with
59:24 these specifics about how you're
59:27 behaving right how are you an arrogant
59:29 soul you know I don't know that works
59:31 maybe as possible but two things I want
59:34 to throw at you before we in this
59:36 episode one I guess I'm trying to figure
59:39 out what you want to talk about first
59:40 what if it takes a little while to
59:41 become human again whatever reason
59:43 there's a limited amount of vessels and
59:45 maybe the infinite amount of souls or
59:46 whatever maybe there's just some other
59:50 job on the other side or whatever but
59:52 if it's a coveted experience to get into
59:54 any one body then you have to make this
59:59 one count because it's a rare thing it's
60:02 like you know when you go traveling
60:04 around the world typically unless you're
60:06 independently wealthy but even if you
60:08 are you've got other responsibilities
60:09 you have to get back to you travel to a
60:12 special location and you want to see
60:13 things but you have a limited amount of
60:15 time and no matter you know you know
60:19 let's just say you're going to live one
60:20 year in Cairo to study the everything
60:23 Egyptian you're going to go to the the
60:25 Valley of the Kings you're a biggies
60:26 you're going to go to a bunch of temples
60:27 up and down the Nile you realize that
60:30 you have a limited amount of time in 365
60:32 days to get all the information because
60:34 this place took tens of thousands of
60:37 years to create you're not going to get
60:40 it all and because we've lost a lot of
60:42 the actual history of who did what when
60:44 and how you are trying to develop
60:47 theories using current theories and
60:49 trying to make your own theories and
60:50 observing I know you feel me but this is
60:53 our life as well this is our incarnation
60:57 of who we are to try and battle the
61:00 elements every single day to accomplish
61:05 something to to give our identity extra
61:10 shots keys right you know people get
61:12 trophies when they're in high school and
61:14 junior high for doing things maybe in
61:16 college as well but the trophy is the
61:19 sort of college diploma that you did
61:21 something well your life is just a
61:23 gigantic collection of those moments
61:25 we're also all in different places in
61:28 the universe which is obviously this
61:31 world for most of you can hear my voice
61:32 and so we have different challenges we
61:36 have different physical challenges
61:37 mental challenges family challenges
61:40 geographical challenges so if you love
61:44 your life some of you're not so happy
61:45 with your lives but every day that
61:47 you're alive you go to the next stage
61:48 you have another day one of the greatest
61:53 things about the movie office space
61:55 written by Mike judge not the show
61:58 called the office but the movie called
61:59 office space is the guy that was all he
62:02 cared a lot about his job he cared about
62:04 pleasing other people
62:06 and so he capitulated constantly until
62:08 he was hypnotized to not care and the
62:11 hypnotist dies in the middle of the
62:13 frickin hypnotism thing I was walking
62:14 around the world for three or four days
62:16 not giving a eff about anything right
62:18 and he suddenly became happy for the
62:22 first time in his life since he was
62:24 probably a kid it's a fictional
62:26 character but I guarantee you my friends
62:29 that I see super duper stress they get
62:31 so stressed that what they end up doing
62:33 is almost coveting and protecting the
62:37 negative frequencies that are destroying
62:39 their life and because they think about
62:41 the negativity they think about the loss
62:42 they think about where they'd rather be
62:44 in a negative way not a positive way the
62:47 law of attraction which might just be
62:49 the built-in gift from the universe
62:52 which is why prayers work to an extent
62:55 right
62:56 if you don't reset every once in a while
62:59 and let go you might be unhappy for a
63:03 really long time until you can have it
63:05 forced out of you until you pass away
63:06 and you know you hear me talk about acid
63:09 every once in a while on the show I've
63:12 been told it's very clean out there and
63:14 easy to get but it's not what the people
63:16 who provide me with a few doses I've
63:19 taken in my lifetime say but hopefully
63:21 that's the case I would say be very
63:23 careful I don't condone anyone taking it
63:26 from anyone because I don't know who
63:27 they're you might who you might be
63:29 getting it from the one thing that
63:31 happens when you do this is Larry Hagman
63:33 said and played junior and the guy on a
63:38 I Dream of Jeannie he said look you know
63:42 once I took it I stopped fearing death
63:44 and I started knowing that love is an
63:47 actual force in the universe
63:51 now consciousness would be if anything
63:55 the substrate of which love hate anger
63:58 fear all those things might be realized
64:00 in some form sure you can inject the
64:04 chemical in a person's body and you can
64:05 get them to feel totally groovy man or
64:08 you can inject the chemical and make
64:09 them you know feel like the hairs on
64:11 their arms or monsters you know it can
64:13 happen but that's all you're what you're
64:15 doing there is just messing with your
64:16 vessel it is trying to
64:19 communicate and make sense of the
64:22 information that might travel in your
64:24 consciousness right your car works
64:28 perfect when you take it off the lot
64:29 then eventually [ __ ] starts breaking
64:32 well is that is the car with the car
64:35 that way when you drove it off a lot no
64:36 what needs to happen to make the car run
64:38 again when you replace that belt
64:40 replaced that hose pop up same thing
64:44 with the human body
64:45 same exact thing right you know today I
64:49 was driving home from my office in LA a
64:51 big [ __ ] thing I don't know what it
64:54 was a rock or a bolt or something the
64:57 car was changing lanes and they kicked
64:58 up this thing and it must have been
65:00 massive because of the stars it's on my
65:02 windshield now brand new car is about
65:06 three inches in diameter with a big you
65:09 know dime shaped impact zone it was big
65:11 and I'm so [ __ ] pissed off you know
65:15 and it's not the guy's fault I ran over
65:17 it it just is on the highway somehow you
65:19 know it's the 405 who the hell knows
65:20 what it is and my partner called me up
65:22 he's like how you doing man you know and
65:24 I just saw him a few hours ago and he so
65:25 I said well I caught a rock on my
65:27 windshield you know and he knows my
65:29 car's brand new and he goes you know he
65:33 goes the good news is is that the
65:35 windshield stopped it from hitting you
65:36 which would have killed you and this
65:40 guy's seen everything he's 70 years old
65:41 and I said I said I said how dare you
65:44 try to make me think of this as a
65:46 positive thing I want to be pissed off
65:48 about this but in the end he was right I
65:51 was blessed that this thing did not fly
65:54 into my face and kill me because the
65:55 thing was actually big enough to damn
65:57 near go through the windshield and punch
65:59 me in the face you know if it didn't
66:00 kill me it would have left a mark I'll
66:02 tell you that much right and I have
66:04 heard of folks driving on the 405
66:08 specifically and things falling off the
66:10 back of trucks hitting the ground
66:11 bouncing up to the windshield and
66:13 killing them and a friend of mine who
66:15 had witnessed this once and it was just
66:16 terrific
66:18 so it's it's the way it's the way we
66:22 perceive it is the way that it eats us
66:24 alive or does it lead us alive I could
66:27 buy a new windshield you know it's like
66:30 I got the money falling out of my ass
66:31 but I could get that fixed
66:33 that's all right but if nothing else I
66:34 get to wake up tomorrow I get to go to
66:36 bed tonight I get to make this episode
66:38 after such a thing occurred I don't want
66:42 to have had that happen but guess what
66:44 you know six months from now whatever
66:46 once fully repaired you know months in I
66:49 could tell the story about how I got my
66:51 new car and Christ I've had a summons
66:53 scratched the [ __ ] out of the front some
66:54 kid rear-ended the [ __ ] back of the
66:56 car at some coffee shop and I got this
66:58 [ __ ] rocking the windshield all
66:59 within six months I just got rid of a
67:02 car I owned for ten years I never had I
67:05 only have one person back into me at the
67:07 last month that was it busted my
67:09 headlight consequently it's the same
67:12 intersection where it happened to me in
67:14 a previous car too it's like it's just
67:16 like one block over from where I'm
67:17 sitting right now people just put their
67:20 cars in reverse and not looking behind
67:21 and backing up apparently that
67:24 intersection is like a Bermuda Triangle
67:25 of confusion or something oh I forgot
67:28 something at home let's just back up to
67:30 the house right really weird life is
67:33 different now that it used to be right I
67:35 think one of the lures of expanding our
67:38 consciousness in this particular realm
67:39 is to say look life is tough for now a
67:42 little bit more than it was 20 30 years
67:44 ago guarantee when you get a job keeper
67:47 for 50 years retire with your pension
67:48 and go I just met a police officer from
67:51 Los Angeles he's just about to finish
67:53 his 30th year he's only 50 years old and
67:56 he's going to retire he's going to move
67:58 to Hawaii because he can he's one of the
68:01 last guys I know that I've been able to
68:02 enjoy that formula
68:04 all right so most of us aren't in that
68:06 formula if you are thank your lucky
68:09 stars don't [ __ ] about your job it's
68:11 the way things used to be
68:13 but if you're stuck in the rat race like
68:16 most of us you're starting businesses or
68:18 taking a second you know making
68:19 sacrifice which keep companies alive
68:21 you're bouncing to a job that you feel
68:23 is more of a transitional job than the
68:25 one you're going to end up with hey it's
68:27 a part of the video game that isn't the
68:29 most fun to play but at the end of the
68:31 battle you're going to win some gold get
68:34 some Chomsky's maybe there's a purple
68:36 drop on that thing and it's going to be
68:38 worth it in the end in closing I just
68:41 want to say this if someone could take
68:44 you to the other side temporarily
68:47 and show you that maybe Shirley MacLaine
68:50 has something on reality and you could
68:53 say okay here's the thing your
68:55 consciousness you know that now right
68:57 any like yep
68:59 I see my consciousness I can feel it I
69:02 see yours and I can feel yours
69:03 and I can feel everyone else's as well
69:06 let me say okay you got two choices here
69:08 you can study consciousness for however
69:13 long you want
69:13 there's no time in this world right I
69:16 wanted to see something about time so I
69:18 renig on the last thing I'm gonna say
69:20 I'm gonna close with time but they said
69:23 do you look I can put you down in the
69:24 human body on this beautiful blue marble
69:26 called planet Earth or this firmament
69:28 dome whatever you like to believe that's
69:30 fine and you can live a life and you're
69:34 probably the top in amount of years you
69:36 can lives about a hundred years you know
69:38 in certain circumstances you might be
69:40 able to get to like 130 like these these
69:42 anomalies in the universe but for the
69:44 most part you live to be 80 to 100 years
69:46 if you make it to 80 you've won I'll
69:49 just say that much right now alright but
69:53 the caveat to this pitch is that you're
69:56 going to go through peaks and valleys
69:57 you know you're going to have a life
69:59 that's good depending on what time we'd
70:01 send you down there you're going to be
70:02 in a boom or a bust cycle you're going
70:05 to be in a great economy with a great
70:06 government not been run by you know
70:09 criminals or you could be in the Middle
70:13 Ages where the average lifespan is 36
70:16 you have to work a lot a lot harder
70:19 you got this choice do you want to sit
70:21 up here with us or do you want to go
70:23 down there with us or the other part of
70:25 us right you may choose to stay up in
70:28 the Celestra realm for a little while
70:30 but eventually like the the Q's and Star
70:32 Trek you're probably going to go down so
70:35 you can forget everything one more time
70:36 believe in Santa Claus believe in magic
70:39 we even believe in a religion whatever
70:41 it is so before you go down you know you
70:46 know that you're buying into this
70:48 potentially positive negative world but
70:53 they tell you look you won't appreciate
70:54 anything if you don't experience a lack
70:57 of freedom you can't appreciate freedom
71:00 see how you feel really
71:01 even though that your consciousness and
71:03 your longer having the aches or pains
71:04 you're floating around the universe and
71:06 so this heavenly realm where all
71:08 knowledge is available you can talk to
71:10 anyone that's ever existed your
71:12 grandfather your grandmother whatever
71:15 eventually you'll go down maybe that's
71:19 what we're doing you know I suggested a
71:22 little bit of this in reincarnation
71:23 right time there's been a recent comment
71:28 someone got into the time-travel episode
71:31 made a really cool comment which is
71:33 we're all talking about the fact that
71:34 time doesn't exist there's only the now
71:36 and I couldn't agree more we're all
71:38 disputing at times the ability to travel
71:41 through time as a scientist you might
71:43 say well time is an illusion created by
71:46 state changes in the universe lunchtime
71:50 doubly so right if we are nothing if we
71:56 are doing nothing more than perceiving
71:57 all of this into existence mean we're
72:00 pushing out to the universe what we
72:02 think we see instead of taking it in
72:03 just as a just as a theoretical
72:05 postulation right time travel may be
72:09 simply you changing your perception to a
72:13 different time to a previous state and
72:15 we don't do it because perhaps we have
72:20 adopted this train that only goes in one
72:22 direction forward and we don't believe
72:25 that we can go backwards so we don't
72:27 even try there's a great movie with
72:30 Christopher Reeve which you know this is
72:33 a Mandela factor on him we all say
72:34 Reeves I was actually watching an
72:37 interview by Richard interview by Dick
72:41 Cavett with Richard Pryor talking about
72:43 how much he loves the Superman series
72:47 and he was actually by saying he loved
72:50 the Superman movies they put him in the
72:51 third Superman movie which was really
72:52 cool but he says Christopher Reeves in
72:56 the interview but anyway Christopher
72:57 Reeves was in a movie called somewhere
72:58 in time and he wanted to fell in love
73:01 with a woman in a painting it was a life
73:03 under seventy five hundred years before
73:05 he was alive and he asked his professor
73:08 at the college you know how would I
73:11 travel in time and I forgot how the
73:14 dialogue beautiful
73:15 we worked out but it worked out such
73:16 that the guy said well what because the
73:21 one room I've heard is that you have to
73:22 get rid of everything that that is
73:24 belonging to this world dress yourself
73:26 in the the garb of that era and then you
73:29 need to chant to yourself or somehow
73:31 convince yourself that you're in that
73:33 time just tell your consciousness that
73:36 you're there and you will wake up in
73:38 that realm and that's exactly what he
73:40 did he laid down on his sofa I believe
73:42 and just kept saying what year it was
73:44 what year it was and then eventually
73:46 this miraculous thing happened that's
73:48 the premise of the first act and the way
73:51 that the movie works out one little
73:53 spoiler is that he accidentally had a
73:56 penny in his pocket from the current day
73:58 and he's having this wonderful time with
74:01 this woman he ends up meeting her ruling
74:03 her she loves him he loves her they're
74:05 going to live their life whatever year
74:07 it was and he pulls this damn penny out
74:10 of the suit that went back with him and
74:13 it's like 1980 or something I don't
74:15 remember what the year was and he all of
74:17 a sudden goes oh my god and he remembers
74:20 where he came from and consciousness
74:22 projected him back and he was instantly
74:25 back in his living room devastated that
74:28 he had traveled through time back home I
74:30 can't remember if he's able to go back
74:33 or not but he definitely tries but he
74:36 was so out of sorts by having fallen in
74:39 love with her and he's so regretful that
74:40 he came back he couldn't get this regret
74:42 out of his mind and so he was having a
74:45 hard time trying to go back that's all I
74:48 remember in season three what I'm trying
74:51 to do is sort of check her between the
74:53 super cerebral and sort of the super fun
74:56 so I've had a lot of people private
74:58 message me and say man I need some more
75:00 of the cerebral stuff that's what
75:02 attracts me to your show so when I go
75:04 back and forth as a variety showing you
75:06 know do a bio on a movie and then come
75:08 back and do something about
75:09 consciousness it's a very conscious
75:11 effort to do that I'm getting a
75:14 tremendous amount of suggestions what
75:17 I'm trying to do is get through this
75:18 huge backlog of episodes that I've
75:20 recorded sometimes I have to put them in
75:24 the editing Bay and listen to them and
75:25 see if they came out okay I've got
75:27 probably three or four episodes I'm not
75:28 sure
75:29 never going to release because I don't
75:30 know if they have any quality to them so
75:31 I got to put them in and drop them in
75:32 and see if I didn't completely flub it
75:36 as I always say I hope you felt this
75:39 episode deep thoughts radio.com for all

76:11 did that me is another video source of
76:14 which you can watch all the episodes
76:16 it's a little bit behind YouTube but you
76:19 can't watch the first season unimpeded
76:21 in case you're new and you start to go
76:22 back on YouTube and there's all kinds of
76:24 weird you know issues with copyright and
76:27 kind of stuff most of them play but
76:29 again 52 episode 52 is completely muted
76:32 not sure how the hell that happened
76:34 sometimes when you upload a video
76:36 they'll say we'll remove the offending
76:38 song out of your video and leave the
76:41 rest of the audio and for some reason
76:42 that service doesn't work very well on
76:44 YouTube and pins I guess to take away
