00:02 [Music]
00:14 so
00:17 [Music]
00:35 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:36 deep thoughts
00:38 today i'm just going to cover something
00:40 that is uh
00:41 [Music]
00:42 sort of etched out of the episode about
00:45 the moon hoax how they did it uh which
00:49 by the way is
00:50 the most single most successful video
00:52 i've ever made
00:54 it's really surprising me um but that's
00:57 totally cool a lot of great new folks on
00:59 board
01:00 and boy the comments are
01:04 if you could just get maybe 200 pages of
01:07 comments of the ones that we've been
01:08 having
01:09 you could just publish them into a book
01:11 and it would be entertaining just to
01:12 read
01:14 it's amazing so today's episode is about
01:17 dealing with the fact that we didn't go
01:19 to the moon
01:21 because it's weird
01:24 we have folks that just
01:28 piss themselves when they think about
01:31 the fact that there's a group of people
01:32 out there that believe we didn't make it
01:33 to the moon
01:35 so i'm going to just take my own bias
01:37 personal subjective stab at this because
01:39 it's all i can do
01:41 because i run into a few of these folks
01:43 and again in my
01:46 experience especially just watching the
01:48 comments
01:49 online we're at about
01:52 i don't know 85 90 85 95
01:56 i don't know i haven't really counted
01:57 but it seems like almost everyone
01:58 understands we didn't go
02:00 and they're okay with that and they're
02:02 not militant and they're not
02:04 trying to put astronauts in jail
02:08 they're just like hey yeah you know i
02:09 understand the circumstances were
02:11 this that and this and we didn't go we
02:14 wanted to of course we wanted to
02:17 did a bunch of great things get created
02:18 in the meantime trying to do what we
02:20 were doing
02:20 sure we live with those inventions to
02:23 this day
02:25 but what's interesting is uh you know
02:26 when you meet one person
02:29 who says they don't they think we went
02:31 to the moon and you
02:32 you just ask some questions well why do
02:33 you think that blah blah blah and
02:35 they'll give you their
02:36 take on things but then and then you go
02:40 on you don't really have a pattern in
02:41 your brain of what those people
02:43 how those people think and then
02:46 you bump into like this last
02:49 week this video isn't even at a week and
02:51 it's it's climbing up on
02:54 4 000 views just whoa
02:58 and i got a bunch of i got a bunch of
02:59 episodes that aren't obviously moon
03:02 based and
03:02 i'm a little scared to release them
03:04 because i'm like oh [ __ ] i got a whole
03:06 group of followers that are interested
03:09 in this kind of thing
03:10 so i'm going to have to work on my
03:12 themes and that kind of thing so i'm
03:14 just going to be checkering
03:15 ones that are typical neural episodes in
03:18 with the ones that are moon episodes and
03:20 other
03:20 sort of episodes of that nature
03:24 so but this is actually something i
03:25 wanted to talk about for a long time and
03:26 it just occurred to me because
03:28 we probably had about four or five
03:31 folks that really were bent out of shape
03:33 one guy got so rude i had to
03:36 i had to kick him out i had to get i had
03:37 to gag him off the youtube channel
03:40 because he's like you know cursing
03:44 at me personally and i'm just trying to
03:45 say dude just
03:47 lay it out man lay it out one guy was
03:49 like you just tell me what
03:51 back you want me to debunk and all
03:52 debunkers like watch the video
03:54 [ __ ] and just
03:55 take your [ __ ] pic jesus christ i
03:57 gotta watch my own video and then say
03:58 okay
03:59 that right there what do you think about
04:00 that one right there what do you think
04:01 of that one you know
04:02 so what's interesting is not everybody
04:06 who thinks
04:06 we did go is a jerk or anything
04:10 that's why it gets it it angers me a
04:12 little bit or irritates me i should say
04:15 when someone gets in there and they're
04:16 like i'm representing the
04:18 fat boy scouts that think we went to the
04:20 moon and you're like
04:22 hey man a lot of people think we went
04:25 and they're not like you
04:27 so relax but there is a
04:30 pattern in people who think we went to
04:32 the moon
04:34 the simplest fact about them is they
04:36 don't think for themselves
04:38 and now they may think for themselves uh
04:42 i don't know i'm gonna they may think in
04:45 terms of
04:46 engineering solutions maybe like they
04:49 can string facts together in their brain
04:50 and go okay well because of that this
04:52 a equals b and everywhere but they don't
04:55 think for themselves in a political
04:57 manner
04:58 they worry about being on the in crowd
05:02 last guy i met face to face
05:05 who heard that i thought we didn't go
05:08 and he
05:08 definitely thought we did go he hadn't
05:11 contemplated it
05:12 he's uh 45 years old he hadn't
05:14 contemplated his whole life that we
05:15 hadn't gone it was as if
05:17 every moon hoax episode on tv every
05:20 youtube thing every conversation had
05:22 never occurred in his life
05:24 when i started asking him about some of
05:27 the facts of
05:28 of the missions the facts you know we've
05:31 lost everything
05:32 lost the original footage i mean god
05:34 damn could you
05:35 can you imagine the bigger [ __ ] bunch
05:38 of [ __ ]
05:39 lie we lost the original footage of all
05:42 the moon missions
05:43 or at least apollo 11. yeah as i'm sure
05:46 it's moving around a lot right guys
05:48 right you know you haven't learned
05:50 anything from hollywood storing things
05:51 in iron mountain and
05:52 that is just a bold face lie to hide
05:55 some
05:56 fragility in the evidence that that
05:59 footage
06:00 that film the canister film ever left
06:02 the planet
06:03 but a bunch of these folks seem to be
06:06 sort of wearing a jersey in their mind
06:10 of raw raw nasa and if you think about
06:14 it
06:14 you know when you have something like i
06:16 hope i don't get lost in this point but
06:18 it's
06:19 when you have something like nasa and
06:20 you're like eight years old
06:23 to you it is sort of like the same
06:27 mystery and wonder as something like
06:30 your favorite sci-fi movie
06:32 you're stuck at home reading books
06:35 watching tv
06:36 and you're looking at nasa really far
06:38 away you weren't there when it
06:40 formed right now for those of you who
06:43 have family members who were a part of
06:44 it
06:45 you are [ __ ] like your ability to pull
06:48 your head out of your ass is probably
06:50 almost impossible now we've got some
06:52 people in the comments that have said
06:53 that they
06:54 were able to become lucid after the fact
06:57 and that their proximity to nasa was
06:59 actually a
07:00 benefit to understanding that we didn't
07:03 go
07:03 and there you go give the i think for
07:06 myself trophy to that dude
07:08 because that was hard trust me uh
07:10 sitting on the outside
07:12 just looking at space shuttle posters
07:14 and that kind of stuff getting that you
07:16 know the
07:17 the moon uh what is it the moon poster
07:19 on the side of your wall when you were a
07:20 kid you could get this moon poster in
07:22 the 80s and it was uh some fake shot of
07:24 the moon and then earth was in the
07:25 background
07:26 and you could get it up eight feet you
07:28 know by 10 feet put it on the side of
07:29 your wall so your bed was like up
07:30 against the moon
07:31 it was pretty cool but it's this fantasy
07:34 thing it's this oh my god nasa can do
07:36 anything and human beings really are
07:38 going to get to the george jetson era
07:40 quicker than we thought i will be flying
07:43 around in a car there will be no more
07:44 roads or the roads will be for peasants
07:46 right
07:47 the other assumption by these people
07:49 which if we were more sensitive we could
07:51 add the little extra thing of
07:53 which is so insulting they actually
07:56 think that we
07:57 want to live in a false world that we
08:00 get off on it
08:01 they think that we're the people that
08:02 don't get anything done that we're just
08:04 the people that sit around
08:05 and complain about things well the two
08:08 guys that debriefed me in 1991
08:11 were two former employees of nasa one
08:14 was seven
08:15 patents related to satellite technology
08:18 he had worked there since 1976 as i
08:20 understand as a prodigy child
08:21 right after he graduated high school at
08:23 16 years old
08:25 his buddy i don't know anything about
08:26 him other than work for the mars mission
08:28 both of them ended up working for the
08:29 mars mission
08:31 i'm an engineer i'm a doer i've done
08:34 more
08:34 unique things in my life than anyone
08:36 i've ever met
08:38 i don't think we went i didn't like the
08:41 fact
08:42 that we didn't go it's just that when
08:45 the world
08:47 tells one lie or you find one lie in the
08:49 world by a certain group of people
08:52 then you tend to think that maybe this
08:54 is something that they do for a living
08:55 maybe it's something that they do to
08:57 extort money out of people
08:58 us right our government at the united
09:02 states of america became
09:05 incredibly corrupt at a pace which was
09:09 next to no other time in history as soon
09:12 as the bullet went through
09:13 jfk's upper right
09:17 part of his brain lbj's in the back
09:21 huddled down in his car with his
09:23 walkie-talkie a lot of people didn't
09:25 think that he was there because usually
09:26 the president and the vice president
09:27 aren't allowed to be in the same place
09:28 at the same time
09:30 unless it's some really formal location
09:31 like the white house or something
09:33 or some campaign stop but he was there
09:37 and that's the foundational period where
09:39 this whole project was
09:41 announced it would have been interesting
09:44 to see if
09:45 kennedy had had two terms would he have
09:48 gone along with the hoax
09:50 would have been interesting wouldn't it
09:52 but back to the people that
09:54 think we went and their butt hurtness
09:58 i don't know i don't know how much
09:59 sympathy i have for a grown man not to
10:01 figure it out
10:03 you know there's an instinctual thing
10:05 about straight masculine alpha males
10:08 it is difficult for us to see weak
10:12 males it is especially a guy pretending
10:15 to be alpha
10:16 who's obviously a beta can't think for
10:19 himself
10:21 you know and this there's just in my
10:23 personal experience
10:25 i've met two people that tried to rebut
10:28 the moon hoax one
10:29 the uh near half a dozen people i've met
10:33 that work for nasa who
10:34 are trying to cover it up again i had
10:37 two folks
10:38 debrief me literally across the lunch
10:40 table
10:42 they told me nothing but everything that
10:44 they knew
10:45 and then in next 25 years goes by
10:48 and i met you know someone who's got
10:51 massive clearance at nasa
10:53 he's a friend of a friend and they push
10:55 him down in front of me and they go you
10:56 two should talk or they push me down in
10:58 front of them
11:00 and i've had this experience uh two very
11:03 vivid times at least
11:05 where the guy was like you know and he's
11:07 looking around like this can't get can't
11:08 make eye contact with me right
11:10 guys probably 10 years older than me at
11:12 least and he's like anybody thinks we
11:13 didn't go to the move just a [ __ ]
11:14 [ __ ]
11:15 quote unquote and i'm just sitting there
11:18 looking straight at the guy
11:20 like well blam i mean last time i did it
11:23 i talked about the fact that we have
11:25 telescopes that should be able to take a
11:26 picture of all the moon landing areas
11:29 and you know map them so we can see them
11:32 nasa's now faked that evidence and the
11:34 lunar landers are now four times as
11:36 large as they normally would be
11:39 but i said that to one guy and he just
11:41 laughed he just immediately laughed and
11:43 he as well there's that
11:46 and then we started having the
11:46 conversation about the fact that we
11:48 didn't go
11:49 this guy has an asset badge in his
11:50 pocket
11:52 just immediately flips no problem can
11:54 have that conversation that happened one
11:56 more time
11:57 different person same scenario name
11:59 calling
12:00 i mentioned a few things and then pow
12:04 sadly none of those things have occurred
12:05 since i started the show which would be
12:07 awesome but it's not about us winning
12:10 and then
12:10 losing or something like that right it's
12:12 not a tit-for-tat much [ __ ]
12:14 what's i think for me what it's about is
12:16 getting on the same page of lucidity so
12:19 that we can move on to the next subject
12:21 i mean do you realize that we're still
12:23 debating something that happened in 1969
12:25 to 1972
12:27 really you know was mark hamill in star
12:30 wars i don't know geez some people think
12:32 it was
12:33 ted turner i don't know we can't get on
12:38 with the program don't you want to go
12:39 the moon i want to the moon i think it
12:41 would be cool
12:42 i don't even need a man to go to the
12:44 moon quite frankly i want to send out
12:46 some robots we got all these amazing
12:48 robots jumping around
12:51 the guys that i run into today and i've
12:53 never run into a female that has any
12:54 problem with believing
12:56 that we didn't go to the moon but i
12:57 don't i don't by the way i don't walk
12:58 around with a big sign on my chest
13:00 saying did you
13:01 you know what happened they've been
13:02 lying to you i don't say anything at all
13:06 it's always someone else bringing it up
13:09 but women cave really really quickly
13:11 because they don't care it's not part of
13:13 their
13:14 chest right but the guys that care
13:19 my my they do remind me
13:22 of your sort of
13:25 eagle scout kind of guy followed all the
13:29 rules
13:30 their pins and badges and ropes and all
13:34 that kind of stuff on their gear was
13:35 because they did what they were told
13:37 and they got good at it they're not bad
13:39 people none of these people are bad
13:40 people
13:42 but they'll get angry about what you're
13:45 saying
13:46 and they also try to engage in
13:47 censorship they'll
13:50 sort of play out their own fears to you
13:52 projecting and saying
13:54 well don't tell anyone else this
13:58 unless you look like you're crazy it's
14:00 like oh well that's what they're worried
14:02 about
14:03 they're worried about looking crazy
14:06 again the integrity of truth with the
14:07 capital t in the universe has no value
14:09 to them because to them
14:11 every day is a battle and a struggle to
14:14 get to the next stage
14:15 of whatever accolade
14:18 reward whatever right and again let's
14:22 loop back to the family members
14:24 for the family members the sons and
14:26 daughters of folks that
14:27 participated in the apollo project
14:29 because they did participate in a nasa
14:32 project
14:33 and i think that they initially fear
14:35 that
14:36 we're saying that that didn't occur it's
14:38 like no the iq of your relative is
14:41 probably
14:42 solid and intact and it wasn't
14:45 their responsibility because they were
14:47 compartmentalized that the end product
14:49 simply went into low orbit
14:51 and the lunar lander was duplicated on a
14:53 sound stage
14:55 and you know alphabet agency folks
14:58 hidden inside you know nasa or you know
15:01 astronaut outfits with gold-plated
15:03 things you can't see who they are
15:06 that has no bearing on your family
15:08 member
15:10 but their family has been telling
15:11 everyone that their family did something
15:13 that no other family member
15:15 did which is still true
15:18 you were selected to work on probably
15:20 one of the most covert aggressive
15:22 scientific projects
15:24 since the manhattan project there's
15:27 accolades to be had
15:29 you know at some point in the history of
15:31 being a human
15:32 each individual has to figure out their
15:34 self-worth
15:36 and they have to isolate things inside
15:39 their mind that says
15:40 this is true therefore i have well i
15:43 have value to the universe right
15:46 self-worth for some people it's a talent
15:49 they uh they are the people that
15:51 participate directly in the apollo
15:53 missions they
15:54 they're a scientist they're a
15:55 mathematician for others they might play
15:57 a
15:58 game of golf or paint on a painting
16:02 paint a canvas excuse me but for a lot
16:04 of folks that have problems with the
16:05 moon hoax
16:07 somehow they have connected themselves
16:08 to this event
16:10 now for those who are family members of
16:11 those who participate in the apollo
16:13 projects and all the other projects
16:14 before that
16:15 it's a very simple equation it's a very
16:17 simple cause and effect model
16:20 their family member who they're related
16:22 to
16:24 participated therefore those genetics
16:26 come down to them
16:28 and hopefully they've done really well
16:30 in the world themselves and they go look
16:32 the reason why i do really well is
16:34 because my family's got a lot of smart
16:35 people
16:36 in it and did i tell you that one of my
16:38 relatives worked on the moon so you
16:39 should take all your clothes off right
16:40 now and jump in the sack with me
16:43 or pay me more money at the company that
16:45 you know i'm potentially getting hired
16:46 at right
16:47 they sit around at bars sit around at
16:49 smoke lounges reciting all of the facts
16:52 that they've been told out of coffee
16:53 books
16:54 but they go on and on about the mission
16:56 details
16:58 and people in the room that don't have
16:59 the ability to remember they don't care
17:03 those people look like geniuses just
17:06 reciting things
17:08 again go back to the fake intelligence
17:10 episode and realize
17:11 at best they are impersonating a smart
17:13 person
17:15 now for those that don't have family
17:16 members involved with the project
17:18 it's a real interesting thing it's a
17:21 real interesting thing to figure out how
17:25 people get attached to this i would
17:28 assume that anyone who was attached to
17:30 the moon missions
17:32 just absolutely by sitting in your
17:33 living room or being
17:35 again younger than me and reading some
17:37 book and find you know just having this
17:39 attachment to their chest
17:41 that's what happened it's a little
17:44 baffling to me
17:45 to be honest i might imagine that they
17:46 would be astonished republican
17:48 in this country but then again the last
17:51 guy i met
17:51 was uh it's so funny i was in a public
17:55 place with this individual in two
17:57 different occasions
17:58 and one they had um a guy
18:02 who was bagging on trump
18:05 and this person immediately caves
18:10 to sort of get along with this guy
18:14 and i don't know what his political
18:16 opinion is
18:17 personally but it seemed fake
18:20 his caving and his it seems like he just
18:23 panders to whoever's in the room
18:25 it's kind of weird and then we were at
18:27 lunch together and the subject of the
18:28 moon came up i don't even know how that
18:30 came up man i
18:31 did not mention it personally to my
18:34 knowledge
18:35 and he went into the
18:39 really you're that you're a crazy guy
18:42 younger than me
18:43 younger than me and i thought wow that's
18:45 unbelievable like
18:47 i'm on the very cusp of you know the
18:49 seven years old if i want to say i
18:51 started my linear thinking at seven
18:53 that's 1976 so that's four years after
18:56 the moon missions
18:57 so how's a guy who didn't get there
19:00 until the 80s
19:03 so i don't know sold and convicted to
19:08 believe in the moon believe in nasa in
19:10 general right has no employment history
19:12 with nasa whatsoever
19:14 when mentioning some of the smoking guns
19:18 never heard of them before and he didn't
19:21 have his eyes widen you know most of us
19:22 would have somebody if somebody said hey
19:24 you know what
19:26 is this conspiracy and you know
19:29 good conspiracies allow you to look at
19:31 the observable world
19:32 and just judge it for what it is right
19:35 just look at the footage and say okay
19:37 hey man if you take the
19:38 moon footage and speed it up to 2x it's
19:40 real time
19:43 okay what do you think that's one sixth
19:45 gravity what are you nuts
19:47 but to some people it's again it's like
19:51 they are
19:52 the not the political not the
19:55 political reporter
19:58 npc but sort of the mpc that's like
20:01 westworld
20:03 they're the androids you know and they
20:06 simply look at you and say oh it doesn't
20:08 look like anything to me
20:11 and it's interesting but the world's
20:13 waking up
20:14 and that's why i'm sort of making this
20:16 episode is because of the preponderance
20:18 of people
20:19 that are very positive and have given
20:21 their own brilliant observation
20:23 and path to waking up to the moon hoax
20:27 it's powerful it's powerful to watch
20:30 these people talk about it and you're
20:31 like my god
20:32 in some of these comments there's at
20:33 least half a dozen comments
20:35 of over a hundred comments where people
20:37 have experienced things at a much deeper
20:40 level
20:40 they could make the episode about it
20:43 being a moon hoax at least
20:45 it would be very convincing to someone
20:46 like myself
20:49 one person mentioned you know having a
20:53 family member deep in the project and
20:56 having to go to all the events after
20:59 the moon landing because there were
21:01 celebratory things happening
21:03 and each each and every time they went
21:05 back for these celebratory events and
21:07 more
21:07 faux evidence was you know blown up or
21:11 passed out or talked about
21:13 they just started looking at it and
21:14 going oh my god this stuff
21:16 looks fake and that's a lot of bart
21:18 sabrell's thing when he said
21:19 his father was in the air force and they
21:21 sent out a booklet
21:24 that he then i think took apart and made
21:26 you know a big collage on his wall
21:29 and he said that once he saw a
21:30 documentary in the 80s
21:32 about a gentleman who worked at the
21:35 highest level documentation on the
21:36 apollo project and he
21:38 knows that we didn't go and he's
21:40 explaining it and he said bart said i
21:42 saw that special
21:43 and then i walked in there and looked at
21:45 my pictures and i thought
21:48 it looks fake all of a sudden you could
21:50 finally see all the anomalies and the
21:51 color
21:52 correction problems that they weren't
21:54 able to do you know between the soil and
21:56 the background and that kind of stuff
21:58 but the number one thing that i
22:01 run into with people that are supposedly
22:03 debunking especially like the guy that i
22:05 had to
22:06 boot out of the comments section is they
22:09 won't
22:10 view the material and
22:14 review it as we have said look
22:17 the guy in the buggy the moon buggy
22:21 doesn't move
22:22 i rewatched a bunch of that stuff
22:23 thinking maybe i had that wrong
22:25 that is a astronaut suit that's been
22:28 inflated probably full of some
22:30 minor padding or something and it is
22:33 just
22:34 on this thing whether it's a miniature
22:36 or not it did there's certain shots that
22:38 really look like it's a miniature
22:41 others uh look like it might be real
22:44 size
22:46 there was a guy who i saw a video where
22:49 a gentleman had a lot of experience with
22:50 dune buggies in general
22:51 and he said you know the the tail
22:55 they kept coming off the tires he goes
22:57 that was one one gravity because the
22:59 arc of that is not at least bit
23:04 freed up by the lack of gravity i mean
23:07 one sixth gravity man
23:09 seriously you want to know how how
23:12 little 1 6 gravity is just imagine you
23:16 get paid
23:18 10 bucks an hour and only give you 1 6
23:20 of it okay
23:22 you are not getting slightly the
23:23 majority of the money
23:25 and these rooster tails coming off the
23:28 back of this
23:29 these tires would be probably in the air
23:31 for quite a while
23:32 just sit there and kind of gotta you
23:35 know wait for
23:36 gravity to pull me down that'd be the
23:39 case
23:40 in every situation if it is truly
23:42 one-sixth gravity
23:44 right i think gravity for a planet can
23:47 be calculated by its diameter
23:49 against ethereal winds so
23:52 you know if the plasma inside the core
23:55 of the earth
23:56 it swims around right so you're going to
23:58 have maybe some
23:59 pockets where things get through and
24:01 this is where you have meridian lines
24:03 inside the bowels of the earth as well
24:05 as ether could be hitting the outside of
24:07 the plasma ball inside the crust of the
24:08 earth and then
24:09 it could you know make it turn make you
24:12 know it could skim the surface and then
24:14 bounce out at a different place
24:15 you would have variable gravity all over
24:17 the earth like we see
24:19 right but what i haven't experienced
24:21 okay
24:22 is sitting down with someone i mean this
24:23 would be a great experience
24:25 again they do this to joe rogan
24:26 unfortunately the poor guy didn't have
24:28 the science background to
24:30 to back it up if he knew as much science
24:32 as he did in mixed martial arts he would
24:33 be kicking the living [ __ ] out of
24:34 everybody who lies to him
24:36 that we did go i think he thinks i mean
24:39 only thing i can assume is that one of
24:41 two things has happened to joe rogan
24:45 someone has basically given some advice
24:47 saying if you want to sell your show
24:49 into syndication you got to get off this
24:51 conspiracy alex jones crap because they
24:53 became friends at one point
24:54 you're never going to make your millions
24:55 of dollars but if you do get off this
24:58 train train that is the moon hoax train
25:01 will get you syndicated we'll get you
25:03 rewarded and you can move on
25:05 maybe that was it or maybe
25:08 and this happens in celebrity circles
25:11 and again if you don't have a big
25:12 background to to fight back
25:14 then you're just gonna have to take it i
25:15 mean it's okay
25:17 he's not you know i don't think he's
25:19 trying to commit any sins in the worlds
25:21 of the
25:21 people i mean if he became a shill and
25:25 and took the first deal maybe right
25:29 but people will will claim that they
25:32 have super high clearance or something
25:33 like that they're from the state
25:34 department or whatever
25:36 and they'll come up to joe at some event
25:38 and say hey you know i heard
25:40 you don't think we went to the moon well
25:41 i can assure you we did
25:43 and it just wasn't the way that you
25:44 think and
25:46 joe's like hey man i don't want to fight
25:48 you know i'm just trying to be funny on
25:50 a microphone get people to think a
25:51 little bit
25:51 about some cool subjects with graham
25:53 hancock okay dude
25:55 we went to the moon right and he needs
25:58 he would need something else for him to
26:00 cross back over the line
26:02 right i've never had someone sit down
26:04 and just
26:06 do to me what i do to other folks which
26:09 is once someone wants to know like
26:11 they're excited they're like man
26:13 you know how do we how why do you think
26:14 we didn't go to the moon and i'm like
26:16 okay well
26:16 you got some time yeah sure cut that
26:18 cigars light it up let's get you going
26:20 and then boom boom boom boom boom right
26:23 pictures on my phone
26:24 we got a tv usually we're blasting some
26:26 youtube videos
26:28 just giving analogies in the room get up
26:30 and do physical analogies
26:31 you know so people can understand how
26:33 ludicrous this whole thing is
26:35 the big one again you guys can say to
26:36 your friends is look
26:38 the average distance to the moon which
26:40 has changed quite a bit i apologize but
26:42 if i
26:43 i use the 237 one 237 000 miles of an
26:46 elliptical orbit of the moon which
26:48 doesn't seem elliptical at all to me but
26:49 anyway
26:50 if you divide a ceiling floor to ceiling
26:53 like an average wall eight foot wall
26:55 by centimeters just it works out really
26:58 well with centimeters
27:00 you have 237 centimeters from the bottom
27:02 of the floor to the top of your ceiling
27:03 to represent
27:04 a thousand miles for every centimeter
27:07 from the bottom of the
27:09 floor to the ceiling man has only been
27:13 proven to be two millimeters off the
27:15 ground which is 200 miles
27:16 that much i think we've proven so they
27:19 want you to believe
27:20 that in the very first time they
27:21 attempted they went from the bottom
27:23 this is apollo 8 and i think 10 all the
27:26 way to the moon circled the moon and
27:28 came all the way back
27:29 safely right safely every single time it
27:32 works
27:34 what baffles me is sometimes folks have
27:36 engineering backgrounds
27:37 and they know better but they're using
27:39 their
27:41 their blubbery beta level personality
27:45 to keep the defense up right but no one
27:48 has sat me down and just
27:50 debunked it now back in 2005-ish
27:53 when bart when i finally first saw bart
27:56 sabrell's movie
27:57 and went through it nasa had a debunked
27:59 page
28:01 and i remember spending quite a few days
28:03 inside the debunk page
28:07 it was awful it was so awful that i
28:10 don't think the pages exist anymore i
28:12 don't know
28:13 i have a relative that builds that site
28:15 but there's something called the smoking
28:17 gun and i might
28:18 end up making an episode a cold smoking
28:20 gun but it has to do with
28:22 once you see it you can't unsee it right
28:25 when one thing is a hoax everything is a
28:28 hoax now imagine let me just let's give
28:29 an analogy of
28:31 of uh an example of this now
28:34 there was a footage i put inside of the
28:37 the episode 311 which
28:41 was i think i can't remember what what
28:44 mission it was
28:45 where supposedly a guy walked onto the
28:47 set picked up some debris and walked off
28:49 the set
28:50 now one of you said that that was a fake
28:52 and that a guy who did it
28:54 confessed as to its
28:57 fakeness and so i wrote back fine
29:01 link me the video that you say this guy
29:03 faked it
29:04 because i have an intimate knowledge
29:07 base of all the tools he would have used
29:09 to make it
29:10 um and so we'll just look at it you know
29:13 and i said that maybe someone had faked
29:14 it but
29:15 i've seen the fake is really good
29:19 because somebody
29:20 said that they and i've looked at other
29:21 footage as well of that exact shot
29:24 and i thought that they had captured the
29:26 partial shadow in the shot but maybe it
29:27 is a fake that's cool
29:29 if it is i apologize for putting it in
29:30 my 311 episode
29:34 but let's just say that that wasn't a
29:35 fake but that was real
29:37 then you got a problem right you got
29:40 something that happened on camera
29:41 that's a problem now the one thing i
29:43 forgot to put in my 311 episode is the
29:45 flag
29:46 flopping around the vacuum of space
29:48 right
29:50 and i didn't i wasn't a you know
29:53 cognitively alive when this was
29:55 occurring so i didn't see the fact that
29:57 in each one of the moon missions they
29:59 made a ceremony out of putting that flag
30:00 in the ground
30:01 and saluting earth supposedly right from
30:04 this
30:05 moon set but every single time they
30:08 stood next to the flag well they're
30:10 obviously creating
30:13 a little bit of turbulence in the in the
30:15 room the wind
30:17 and so the flag would respond most the
30:19 time it responded i guess this
30:21 occurring according to an interview i
30:23 just saw of another guy
30:24 who had crawled out of the interview or
30:26 sorry crawl out of the
30:28 excuse the moon mission validity
30:31 in an interview with bart sabrell
30:34 but he said on one of them a guy swung
30:36 his hand and boy that flag just went
30:38 woof
30:39 and did a whole belly flop
30:42 in the middle of the vacuum space and
30:44 again this is where they say
30:46 that feet that are far away from the
30:49 pole or supposedly banging the pole and
30:50 the kinetic
30:51 energy transfers up into the pole and
30:54 manages to kinetically transfer
30:56 into cloth i mean seriously any of you
30:59 guys that are
31:00 just even minor scientists please debunk
31:03 that
31:04 for anybody who has any problem cloth
31:06 does not have a lot of kinetic transfer
31:09 capabilities it might have a transverse
31:10 wave that you could inject by putting in
31:13 a tremendous you know transverse wave
31:16 push at the very beginning like when you
31:18 take your bed sheets you ever taken your
31:20 your uh comfort on top of your bed and
31:21 you whip it
31:23 you know even as a housewife that that
31:26 transverse wave dies super fast and it
31:28 barely hits the other side
31:30 with the same momentum it's like a
31:31 quarter to a fifth of the momentum on
31:33 the other side
31:34 because cloth does not transfer kinetic
31:36 energy well
31:37 okay anyway when you see a smoking gun
31:42 it's over the official story gets
31:46 chucked out the door
31:48 the moon missions have so many smoking
31:50 guns
31:51 you know the portal doors and this is
31:54 something i mentioned and i lost my
31:55 point
31:56 in 311 which is you have a two-foot door
32:00 and a three-foot white astronaut never
32:03 any photographs or movies
32:04 of them coming out of that hole
32:08 one of the other big super smoking guns
32:10 is that they never took a video camera
32:12 ever ever ever and started a shot
32:16 and turned it towards earth and then
32:19 turned
32:19 pulled pulled it back why because they
32:21 could not possibly fake that inside of a
32:24 rectangular studio building so six
32:27 missions
32:28 successfully land on the moon and not a
32:30 single astronaut takes the camera and
32:32 points it at the earth
32:34 oh and they'll probably give you some
32:36 aperture burn out the film [ __ ]
32:38 excuse
32:39 well if you can film any part of the
32:41 moon's surface
32:42 with reflection you're talking about
32:44 more lumens
32:45 slash nits coming off that baby than it
32:48 would ever be coming off of the uh
32:51 off the earth ever right
32:54 fact the amount of shots from the earth
32:56 of the earth
32:57 are minimal because they are so hard to
32:59 fake because you have to have a high-res
33:01 negative
33:02 of the earth to then splice in
33:05 to the negative right in the hbo show
33:09 westworld one of the funniest
33:10 things in the first episode is that they
33:12 stumble on a photograph
33:15 that is of the outside world and a woman
33:17 standing in what looks like new york or
33:19 san francisco
33:20 the nice modern building in the
33:21 background some traffic going by and
33:23 she's smiling
33:24 it's like a little five by seven or
33:26 three by five probably three by five
33:29 and the rancher who is uh
33:33 dolores father finds it and he sits in
33:35 his rocking chair
33:37 on the porch looking at this thing
33:38 because it didn't look like anything
33:40 like he's ever seen before
33:41 and for some reason he can see it
33:44 he shows it to his daughter and she says
33:47 the line
33:48 well it doesn't look like anything to me
33:51 hmm he stays up all night looking at
33:53 this photograph because for him that was
33:55 a deal breaker
33:56 it was a smoking gun that wherever he
33:58 was there was another place
34:02 and it harkened to the code in his in
34:04 his
34:06 robotic origin
34:09 that his whole world's a facade but let
34:12 me ask you guys
34:13 in the second half of this thing
34:16 are there lies that we should tell
34:20 to protect the uh the integrity of the
34:23 world
34:25 what if we had a epic battle with angels
34:30 and demons we're just sort of the fodder
34:32 in between but i mean angels start
34:34 dropping out of the sky
34:37 demons are crawling out of the bowels of
34:38 the earth or whatever
34:40 i hate that analogy but whatever they
34:42 get here and they're just
34:44 having at it it's not judgment day
34:47 it's just something this is just they
34:49 have to do this and now humans on earth
34:51 unequivocally know that there are angels
34:55 and there are demons there's a god
34:56 there's a devil
34:58 that everything we read in the bible is
35:00 true wow
35:02 but we go maybe a century after this
35:04 event
35:06 and we realized that the quality of life
35:08 just deteriorated
35:09 considerably why because man lost choice
35:14 now all those rules about do and don't
35:17 well they mean a hell of a lot more
35:18 don't they
35:21 the john podesta pedophile the joe biden
35:24 pedophile
35:25 they now look at their deeds and they
35:27 say oh my god i'm going to hell
35:29 i better repent i better never ever do
35:31 this i better confess to the world
35:33 that's who i am
35:35 one case one of those gentlemen murdered
35:37 a little girl with his brother
35:39 so 100 years the 100-year anniversary of
35:41 the war ending
35:43 we look around and go man this is turned
35:45 into a miserable place
35:47 yeah obviously i if there was a god i
35:50 doubt that uh
35:52 this would be allowed to continue but
35:54 just for the sake of an analogy that's
35:57 crazy makes a point will we ever start
36:00 concealing the truth of that so that we
36:04 could get back to a world where
36:05 we can make choices again we didn't know
36:10 the exact rules of the universe but we
36:13 did have we do have a sense of right and
36:15 wrong
36:16 right all these people have sense senses
36:18 of right and wrong
36:19 they do my concern about this
36:23 is that if we have a subspecies of human
36:25 beings and that is what they are
36:27 they cannot think for themselves to put
36:30 the pride of these things
36:32 over the integrity of truly
36:35 existing in the world as it is there
36:38 better be a good goddamn reason
36:40 while that's occurring and you know
36:44 who knows we haven't been privileged
36:47 with
36:48 the global truth of all minds in this
36:52 world history right we think that
36:54 there's zero point energy systems all
36:56 over the place but we haven't been able
36:58 to
36:59 um learn about them like we learned
37:03 the multiplication tables when we were
37:05 kids
37:06 a lot of people worry about you know
37:08 great aliens
37:10 and what their objectives might be and
37:13 the more this
37:14 election in 2018 goes by i really i just
37:17 think about john carpenter's they live
37:20 and i i'm almost convinced that every
37:23 single
37:24 elected democrat is a is one of them
37:27 at least the top super pac i mean
37:29 doesn't pelosi look
37:30 just exactly like that woman that
37:33 ronnie piper found in the grocery store
37:36 with his glasses on
37:37 oh you're one of them the lies and
37:40 deceit and evil
37:41 in some of these folks is just
37:44 astonishing
37:45 right they call good people bad people
37:49 i saw an ad run i'm just going to
37:51 digress for a split second because we're
37:52 trying to talk about the integrity of
37:54 the human being here towards the end
37:57 i've seen democratic political ads on
38:00 youtube as i'm trying to surf through
38:01 videos doing research and it was every
38:04 single thing that donald trump has
38:06 actually delivered
38:07 they said that it hadn't been delivered
38:10 like tax cuts
38:12 supporting the veterans something that
38:13 the democrats didn't do and and the
38:15 previous
38:15 republican administrations like everyone
38:17 before trump
38:18 up to maybe kennedy right
38:22 but they took every single thing that
38:23 trump has accomplished
38:25 said that it hadn't been accomplished
38:27 and that if you didn't vote blue
38:29 then none of this was ever going to get
38:31 accomplished well that'd be amazing for
38:33 the idiot that believed that ad
38:35 that's someone who couldn't possibly
38:37 possibly
38:38 be paying attention to their reality
38:40 some young kid or something right
38:42 just turned 18 and can vote or something
38:45 and then of course once
38:46 if they were to go blue they'd just turn
38:48 around and say see it's all done
38:49 we already did it because trump did it
38:51 right and they'll just
38:52 it's like that scene in uh dragon slayer
38:56 right where they finally kill the dragon
38:58 and the king
38:59 stands on the dragon he's like this
39:00 frail guy that can barely walk and he
39:03 stumbles up on top of the dragon and
39:05 some you know
39:08 dude reads off this declaration about
39:11 how the king killed the dragon when this
39:12 was a kid who did it right
39:15 that's the scum of the earth man those
39:17 kind of people
39:18 but now donald trump loves saying that
39:20 we landed on the moon doesn't he
39:23 i think in his position one he may
39:26 believe it i don't know that he cares
39:28 much about
39:29 science on that level i'm sure he cares
39:31 about the end objective and that kind of
39:32 thing
39:33 and you know quite frankly if we ever
39:36 have been to the moon
39:39 it may have been through completely
39:41 different means of some secret
39:43 you know space program right but then
39:46 that's sort of uh something we can't
39:49 debate
39:50 because we the people don't have any
39:52 knowledge of it whatsoever we have
39:53 probably never seen a rocket that can do
39:55 it a ship that can do it
39:57 we've never seen a photograph of anyone
39:58 on the moon
40:00 personally if that ever occurred
40:04 and again the study of the van allen
40:06 belts which there's a couple commenters
40:08 saying
40:09 they'll just kind of come in and say
40:10 well those things don't exist or they're
40:12 not that intense and then they'll walk
40:13 off
40:15 it's like the guy saying tell me any
40:18 point about the moon hoax that you think
40:20 is makes it fake and i'll tell you how
40:22 it's
40:23 actually true go ahead tell me and i'm
40:26 sitting there going
40:28 just do it yourself man just get
40:30 microsoft word
40:32 i mean youtube lets you post these
40:33 massive comments you can post
40:35 pages and pages of comments right all in
40:37 one post right
40:39 but the other thing too is go make your
40:40 own video dude
40:42 if you're the massive debunker well then
40:44 i
40:45 guarantee you'll have four times the
40:46 views i get if you can prove that we win
40:49 in fact why don't you go in your
40:50 backyard and build the [ __ ] and
40:51 go right
40:52 jesus nasa is one employee short if you
40:56 think we went and you think
40:57 you know how we went right
41:00 you're the smartest person in the world
41:04 so funny i have one rather close friend
41:07 who
41:07 uh thinks we went and uh
41:11 he's a very unique case we can
41:15 talk about it and he's very friendly
41:17 he's very friendly about it he knows
41:18 that i think we didn't go
41:20 and he knows that i know that he thinks
41:22 we did go
41:23 he doesn't have anything but like let's
41:27 just say that the conversation needed to
41:28 be one hour to discuss
41:31 the evidence against the moon in a rapid
41:33 fire manner right
41:35 he might have five minutes of rebuttal
41:39 so out of all the topics that can be
41:40 mentioned he only knows of about five
41:42 percent
41:43 of the uh complete debunking
41:46 claims that have been you know piped
41:48 into him from nasa oh well i heard this
41:51 because of that you know you can't see
41:52 stars because the aperture of the camera
41:54 and he's a big camera guy right
41:56 and so i think that's interesting
42:00 the other thing is that he bottoms out
42:01 super duper fast
42:04 and he'll say to me
42:08 that he's religious well you know i'm
42:10 religious and i believe in
42:12 aliens and so he
42:16 he has absolutely bought hook line and
42:18 sinker the that there's aliens on the
42:20 moon
42:22 and so i look at this individual and i
42:24 say you know obviously he's a sweet guy
42:25 no problem there he would do anything
42:28 for you that kind of guy right really
42:30 true blue
42:31 good friend but he loves fiction
42:35 he loves fiction there's other things
42:38 that he worships that are very fictional
42:40 and it's great he has made himself a
42:42 really wonderful human being
42:44 by believing all this fiction
42:47 religion makes people good people in
42:50 some cases
42:51 and all they're believing in is fiction
42:53 all right
42:55 is that you really want to disturb that
42:56 guy's
42:58 path in life you want to make him
43:00 cynical does you want to make him wake
43:01 up the next day he's drinking a fifth of
43:03 vodka because he realized we didn't go
43:04 the moon and the whole world's different
43:06 than he thought
43:07 that guy in my opinion is never going to
43:10 be prepared for the truth
43:12 and that's this his challenge and so
43:14 what he has done brilliantly
43:17 is not rock the boat for his
43:19 consciousness
43:20 he knows he can't handle it i will say
43:23 that he is also
43:24 to his credit not a person who uses his
43:26 religion to tell others
43:28 that they're going to hell okay
43:30 sometimes you run into those folks too
43:32 well
43:33 you know i'm going to tell you how it is
43:35 and i because i have all the coveted
43:37 knowledge that
43:38 that that determines whether or not you
43:40 go to heaven or hell
43:41 i'm really important in your life and
43:43 you know you if you make me angry i
43:44 won't even tell you what's going to get
43:46 you to hell
43:47 right there's those people we've all met
43:49 them right
43:51 just because someone gets older doesn't
43:52 mean they actually grew up
43:55 that's something i learned as a really
43:57 young age
43:59 and it was sort of
44:02 confusing to me you know it was like
44:05 i was like nine years old i'm looking at
44:07 people in their 30s and then they're
44:09 kind of
44:09 they're children they can't deal with
44:11 anything or deal with a lot of what life
44:13 throws at them
44:16 and part of me is just going how is that
44:18 possible
44:19 how is it possible that you've been on
44:21 this earth so long
44:23 and you're not using your time to enrich
44:25 your
44:26 your pool of information your ability to
44:29 think for yourself and
44:31 to deduce things and
44:34 you know later you find out that you
44:36 know your formative years are extremely
44:38 important between 0 and 18
44:40 at least the united states of america
44:42 when you have to go out and get a job
44:43 typically you can choose to go earlier
44:46 than that but
44:46 at 18 you're going to get kicked out
44:48 you're going to at least go to college
44:50 but at some point you have to pay the
44:52 bills right and at that point
44:55 i think a human being goes into stasis
44:59 they slow down their academic prowess
45:02 because they're busy they're trying to
45:04 work
45:05 if they learn anything it's to do their
45:07 craft better so they can make more money
45:08 and get promoted
45:10 you know some folks have children and
45:13 you know your average
45:14 stay-at-home mom god bless you guys i
45:17 hope your trend
45:18 blows up in this world trust me
45:22 you're busy with children and maybe you
45:25 don't
45:26 use youtube and and conspiracy videos to
45:29 keep yourself
45:30 entertained when you get a moment to
45:31 yourself right maybe you're getting a
45:33 mani pedi or something right
45:34 whatever you can do to recharge your
45:37 battery from taking care of children
45:40 i understand that right i am
45:43 from the midwest old school where
45:46 virtually everyone's an alpha male and
45:50 we
45:50 view things that a man is responsible
45:54 for protecting his family
45:57 and one becoming the best human being
45:59 you can be obviously but then in the end
46:00 to protect your family
46:02 and i think that information
46:05 is part of the protection system and so
46:08 you have information that needs to be
46:10 protected from your family
46:12 and you have information that needs to
46:13 be brought into your family
46:15 protection information let's talk about
46:17 that for a split second
46:19 let's say dad went off to vietnam and
46:22 saw a bunch of horrific stuff
46:24 he needs to protect his family from the
46:26 horrors
46:27 that don't need to be spoken about at
46:29 the kitchen table
46:33 there are you know i don't know if it's
46:35 still
46:36 a big booming industry anymore but
46:38 pornographic material
46:40 that perverts everything about a human
46:43 being's brain
46:44 right about what partners actually want
46:46 in this world
46:47 you know it just it gets crazy but they
46:50 have to protect their kids
46:51 from bad content that will corrupt them
46:54 i think it also needs to go down to pop
46:56 science we need to keep our kids away
46:58 from
46:59 any lecture at school that talks about
47:01 you know climate change slash global
47:03 warming [ __ ]
47:04 right it's a complete [ __ ] facade the
47:08 smartest people
47:09 on this planet including you know the
47:11 head meteorologist at mit
47:13 knows it's fake and has said as much
47:16 right so we have to
47:19 keep our kids at home as long as we
47:21 possibly can so we teach them
47:24 and then when they go out into the
47:25 public schools and hopefully get into a
47:27 private school
47:28 you've got to monitor what your kids are
47:29 learning so you can counteract any bad
47:31 information
47:33 so that's part of what a parent has to
47:34 do and mothers do this as well of course
47:38 but then there's information that your
47:39 kids need
47:41 when you think about your child or some
47:43 even someone else's kid you don't have a
47:44 kid yet you're going to have kids
47:45 whatever you never had them but you
47:47 understand this paradigm
47:50 you don't want your kid to be physically
47:52 abused in any way shape or form
47:55 if you have a daughter you don't want
47:56 her to get in you know the wrong boy or
47:57 get in the wrong party and get
47:59 into some bad situation uh but at a
48:03 minimum level you don't want your kid to
48:05 come back you know some
48:06 crazy religious person and telling the
48:09 whole family they're going to hell i
48:10 have a cousin that did this
48:11 she went out and married a guy who's
48:14 very
48:15 christian very religious like one of
48:17 these families that lives out in the
48:18 woods
48:18 and they just think that you
48:22 you just slip over this line and boy
48:24 you're going to hell
48:26 so we have to protect the minds of our
48:28 kids
48:30 we also want their eyes wide open right
48:33 now
48:33 the moon mission is a great way to teach
48:35 your kids i think
48:36 unfortunately okay that sometimes
48:40 lies are told and again
48:43 this could be a lie that's told because
48:46 we were trying to bankrupt the soviet
48:48 union we were trying to
48:50 conceal a missile program into a space
48:53 program
48:54 i don't think there was a single
48:55 employee at nasa and i really mean this
48:58 a thousand percent
48:59 i don't think there was a single
49:01 employee at nasa
49:02 that was working on the apollo missions
49:04 and all the previous missions that
49:05 didn't want to go to the moon
49:08 of course they wanted to go why wouldn't
49:10 they right
49:11 it's a hell of a thing to start digging
49:14 into this rabbit hole and finding out
49:16 that it wasn't what you thought it was
49:18 that it was a lie you may actually go
49:21 through
49:22 the full kubler-ross thing anger denial
49:24 negotiation and acceptance
49:27 i can't remember really being upset at
49:29 all
49:30 i was fascinated i was fascinated that
49:32 this thing was
49:33 forged for those that can't believe it
49:37 obviously they're still stuck in anger
49:40 maybe they tap into denial
49:44 and what's interesting is sometimes
49:45 these folks are very
49:47 very successful in their personal lives
49:49 you know their business lives
49:51 and so they think that hey i have a way
49:53 of thinking and that way of thinking is
49:55 very successful for me
49:56 and so i have a way of thinking about
49:58 the moon missions i have a way of
49:59 thinking about those people who think we
50:00 didn't go
50:02 and i don't feel good about those people
50:04 because they're forcing me to go through
50:05 something that's
50:06 going to make me angry i don't like to
50:08 be angry i don't like to be in denial
50:10 i don't like to debate the facts of my
50:12 life and i don't have to accept it in
50:14 the end because i'm my own human being
50:17 and that's the real truth of the game
50:18 yeah you don't have to believe
50:20 it doesn't really you know bother me
50:22 that much i think that being rude in
50:24 public about it
50:26 is where i draw the line to where again
50:29 you're not going to get an invitation to
50:30 the next meeting
50:31 if you can't you know debate sensibly
50:34 about things
50:36 something occurred to me i keep
50:37 obsessing on i think which is one of the
50:40 weakest links
50:41 which is when the the is it the limb
50:45 the the module at the top of the lunar
50:47 module that pops off and comes back up
50:49 to rendezvous with the capsule and go
50:51 home
50:53 and again it has this teeny tiny
50:54 two-foot aperture
50:56 to crawl through right and supposedly i
50:59 guess maybe they can take their suits
51:00 off and go through with their human
51:01 bodies that would work great
51:03 but i am unaware okay of any mission
51:08 where this device was put in low orbit
51:11 in earth
51:11 orbit 200 miles up and they tested
51:15 at all the little retro cone rockets you
51:18 know you see this thing do these
51:20 it's it's absolutely right out of 2001 a
51:23 space odyssey for any one of you who
51:25 haven't seen 2000 space odyssey all the
51:27 way through
51:27 i want you to get into that film
51:31 look at the pod that they created
51:34 in the film where the uh the occupants
51:37 of the odyssey would go outside to fix
51:39 things or move around
51:41 and the way that it turns and spins and
51:43 does all of its rotation
51:44 with a model that's i think mounted on a
51:47 plate of glass
51:48 or robotic cameras or something
51:51 it's exactly how this unit moves when
51:53 it's rendezvousing with this capsule
51:54 with the background of the
51:56 the moon rotating right which is that
51:58 big giant clay model they made
52:00 they didn't know this thing would work
52:01 they didn't know that those little cones
52:03 were
52:04 ever going to work properly and so you
52:06 have a device that has never been tested
52:08 once not once before apollo 11.
52:14 well now as bart sabrel said
52:18 when they made the 747
52:21 they had at least 30 years of aviation
52:24 in their pocket before they started
52:25 making this plane
52:27 it took three more years
52:30 to get finished meaning a 13-year uh
52:33 design span to get this plane working
52:35 this jet
52:36 we already had other jets right and it
52:39 took over 160 attempts to get it off the
52:42 ground
52:43 so you fly down a runway and you try to
52:45 pull up the rudders and
52:47 nothing happens you can't get off the
52:49 ground you don't have enough thrust
52:50 there's not enough lift in the wing
52:51 design
52:53 but this unit left the moon's surface
52:56 and rendezvoused and it looks exactly
52:59 like a fictional movie made by stanley
53:01 kubrick
53:02 all right doug tremble is one of the big
53:04 guys that worked on that film
53:06 there's a whole story behind doug
53:08 trumbull and
53:10 once 2001 space odyssey was over
53:13 he was very very confident in himself
53:16 and one of the greatest criticisms of
53:17 meeting this gentleman is that he would
53:19 never
53:20 give you the time of day one director
53:23 was trying to hire him for his movie and
53:25 he went inside the office and he was
53:27 trying to talk to the guy he had a
53:28 meeting
53:29 and he took a phone call after a phone
53:31 call every 30 to seconds
53:33 to two minutes and was never paying
53:35 attention to the director and finally
53:36 guy just walked out of the room and said
53:38 you're not the guy to work on my film
53:40 you don't give a [ __ ] my project even
53:42 exists
53:44 and so it's very interesting what would
53:46 make someone so
53:48 amazingly confident obviously talent
53:52 but i think that contributing to the
53:55 apollo missions would
53:56 be huge and you know you could
53:58 contribute to 2001 a space odyssey
54:00 and not do another thing and walk off
54:03 and start making movies and usually
54:04 all that stuff that's on the moon hoax
54:06 that's my technology
54:09 if any of you've seen a 2001 space
54:11 odyssey one of the beginning
54:13 scenes in the kind of second half of the
54:15 first act is
54:16 the pin that's floating the guy had
54:19 fallen asleep in his chair and this
54:21 beautiful pin is floating in the air
54:24 and this stewardess comes up really slow
54:26 and grabs it
54:27 and puts it in his pocket and the way
54:30 they did this special effect is a big
54:31 giant sheet of glass and they'd stuck
54:33 the
54:33 pin to it and they're just moving the
54:35 piece of glass which is absolutely
54:37 brilliant
54:38 right and so the pod
54:41 is a more three-dimensional rotational
54:43 object in the movie and it's rotating
54:45 and turning and stopping
54:47 exactly the way that this module comes
54:48 up to the
54:50 to the capsule to go home that for me
54:54 is just a massive smoking gun why
54:56 wouldn't they take this thing in low
54:58 orbit
54:58 push it out and say okay we're not even
55:01 going to get in it we're just going to
55:02 use a big wire
55:03 and we're going to use a little remote
55:06 control controller and see if these
55:07 little
55:08 retro things work because this thing has
55:10 to work because if it can't
55:12 dock if it misses you realize if that
55:14 thing were to miss
55:15 the door and then just start going off
55:18 you're never going to get it again
55:19 especially those little
55:20 those little retro rocket things on the
55:22 outside don't work
55:24 it's really hard to talk about this and
55:26 not get into some of those situations
55:29 i have met folks that believe we went to
55:30 the moon that can lament on
55:32 about any special effect you want to
55:34 discuss
55:35 i'll tell you how exactly how they did
55:37 it and then you go okay great
55:39 look at this footage right here of
55:40 apollo apollo 11.
55:43 oh oh well that's real well it looks
55:45 exactly like the other footage
55:46 right one of my closest friends in
55:49 hollywood
55:50 who is legendary for a lot of amazing
55:53 special effects
55:54 when we've started uh hanging out at his
55:56 house
55:58 he he is the ideal guy that
56:02 believed he went to the moon because he
56:04 was
56:06 he is intelligent and he's able to have
56:07 a conversation about it
56:10 and so he
56:13 uh over the course of i think maybe six
56:16 months or so
56:17 we had we had a couple really good
56:18 sessions and he respects me dearly which
56:21 is
56:22 a big benefit of course for me but i
56:25 remember
56:25 i don't know we probably had two
56:27 evenings together
56:29 and we're working on some properties of
56:30 his at the time
56:32 and i came like third or second or third
56:34 time or whatever
56:35 and he always made these drinks for me
56:38 and he's a master at making in manhattan
56:40 i'll say that
56:41 and he said so he looks over his little
56:44 island in his kitchen this beautiful
56:45 town house he had
56:47 he just looks at me and the first thing
56:48 he said on this this other visit he goes
56:51 so
56:52 we never went to the moon i said no i
56:54 don't think we did
56:56 you know and he goes he goes i've been
56:57 all over this thing since last time we
56:59 met and he goes you know me
57:00 i know all these special effects are
57:01 done he goes once i started
57:03 taking my 40-year support 40-year
57:06 portfolio
57:07 of special effects and this guy's
57:09 legendary for his special effects
57:10 and started looking at all these shots i
57:13 saw it all
57:14 because it goes first thing i noticed
57:16 was all the light sources on all the
57:18 images from the moon he goes
57:19 i can't believe i didn't see it before
57:22 no one had suggested to me to even look
57:24 right i mean so again yours truly
57:29 you know i i hate to ever say
57:32 you know anything that's remotely like
57:34 i'm so special you should believe me
57:36 more than you should believe your mother
57:38 your father or whatever
57:39 i hate saying anything like that right
57:42 um
57:43 you know when alex jones said he talked
57:44 to the q team oh my god this poor
57:47 bastard i swear to god he really he
57:49 really blew it not getting on the q
57:51 a don project regardless of what that
57:53 guy is i think he's extremely real
57:55 nowadays
57:56 i don't know i don't know why he lied
57:57 about the moon thing but i don't know
57:58 why trump lies about it either
58:00 it's just it's just one of these things
58:02 maybe they just go look
58:04 it's better that we just keep this going
58:05 because of my shift like we're not gonna
58:07 we're not gonna tell the world that nasa
58:09 lied about the moon missions on my shift
58:10 because that's gonna undermine
58:12 the confidence in government at a time
58:14 when the government's having the deep
58:15 state cleaned out
58:17 right so let it happen 10 20 years from
58:20 now
58:20 and i think it will at some point right
58:22 but i've been super fortunate
58:25 i am interested in all things
58:29 all things right and i think a lot of
58:30 you are too and it's a curse it's an
58:33 absolute curse it's more of a curse in
58:35 my home where i've got
58:37 you know a bunch of guitars i got but i
58:39 got still got kind of remnants of my
58:41 music studio hanging out i'm like oh my
58:42 god i
58:43 really want to make some music but i've
58:45 got movies to write and i've got
58:47 other technology to invent and innovate
58:49 and it's tough to walk around but i also
58:52 want to kick back and enjoy an episode
58:53 of frasier you know i want to just find
58:56 out how great writers write
58:58 perfect comedy you know i can speak for
59:00 myself and that for any of you and i
59:02 doubt anyone made it to the end of this
59:04 episode who still believes we went to
59:05 the moon
59:06 but if you're open-minded enough to get
59:10 to the
59:10 this particular point let me just tell
59:12 you i'm not here to piss on your parade
59:14 man
59:15 you're looking at a guy that really
59:18 really really
59:19 wanted to believe that we went but you
59:21 know what when i finally came to terms
59:23 the fact that we didn't go a whole
59:25 nother thing happened inside my soul
59:26 which was like
59:27 all right let's go let's do this right
59:30 don't you want to do this
59:32 do you believe what man can i think we
59:34 can
59:35 we just need to start being really
59:36 honest with ourselves about it
59:38 let's not set a 10-year deadline i mean
59:40 i know that a uh
59:42 what is it a a goal without a deadline
59:44 is a dream
59:45 i understand that perfectly well
59:48 i'm a doer i want to get things done i
59:51 think that
59:53 you know one of the i think that
59:56 statement a goal without a deadline is a
59:57 dream
59:58 is really for someone who is just
60:00 getting into their goals
60:01 it's brand new to them i don't know you
60:03 know i've gotten some goals in my
60:04 lifetime but i've never really
60:06 strategically sat down and said
60:07 i'm gonna do something new that i've
60:09 never done before
60:10 write your first movie that'll kick your
60:13 ass boy
60:14 but once you've done it the mindset
60:17 that is fruitful every single day for an
60:20 organization like space force or
60:21 something like that right would be
60:24 everyone involved every single day
60:27 wants to be finished every single day at
60:29 the end of the day
60:31 meaning if you want to go to the moon
60:34 then everyone involved at the end of the
60:37 day
60:39 their goal is to figure it all out and
60:42 as long as that's your
60:43 daily regiment and your daily internal
60:45 goal
60:47 it doesn't matter what the actual
60:48 deadline is because everyone involved
60:51 wants this thing finished as soon as
60:53 possible
60:54 because let's just say that we develop a
60:57 vehicle
60:58 that can get to the moon looks nothing
61:00 like a saturn v it uses anti-gravity
61:02 it's got a
61:03 infinite energy system inside of it
61:05 whatever
61:07 well the second we step out on the moon
61:10 safely
61:10 we're not being killed by radiation and
61:12 heat and cold and all that stuff
61:15 and we roam around we get back in and we
61:17 come home
61:18 now what we've got a whole multi-century
61:22 millennial
61:23 plan for the moon we want to build space
61:27 stations right we want to build
61:28 a place where we could send human beings
61:30 to live safely do a lot of
61:32 experimentation
61:33 what is the moon what is that place up
61:35 there what made all these
61:37 perfectly symmetrical things we've been
61:38 calling craters you know
61:40 maybe we find out it's completely lethal
61:42 to be there
61:44 we step out on the moon and we just some
61:46 meridian plasma
61:48 invisible force comes out of the moon's
61:50 surface
61:51 creates a little crater looking thing
61:52 and fries one of the astronauts and
61:54 we're like oh my god
61:55 i guess you're not supposed to touch the
61:56 surface because as soon as you touch the
61:58 surface
61:58 it digs a little streamy hole it goes
62:00 straight down to the plasma core and
62:02 then out comes the plasma
62:04 spout like yellowstone and kills the
62:06 astronaut
62:07 which is why we got to send robots up
62:10 there first
62:10 right rovers i want to see it in my
62:14 lifetime
62:15 i do for all of us that that were
62:19 too young to see it and remember it as
62:21 children
62:22 our whole thing was well eventually
62:24 we'll go i mean i completed the 80s
62:27 looking at you know popular science
62:29 magazines scientific american magazines
62:31 tons of books on the subject matter omni
62:34 magazine which was always selling some
62:36 ticket to the moon it was really funny
62:38 how many times have we seen people sell
62:41 tickets to orbit the moon
62:43 i think elon musk is trying to pawn that
62:45 [ __ ] off right now
62:47 with the spacex company how many people
62:50 the russians have sold tickets no one is
62:53 gone
62:54 no one is gone oh interesting
62:58 i mean these these billionaires that buy
63:01 these you know
63:02 what does it does 250 million dollar
63:04 tickets
63:06 did their money does their money ever
63:07 get transferred anywhere does it ever
63:08 sit in escrow
63:09 is it just one of these here's your
63:11 golden ticket and get out of here now
63:13 because it's never going to happen tell
63:14 your friends
63:15 we named a star after you if you're a
63:17 truther
63:18 you know you live in this sort of um
63:21 conflicted universe a little bit it's
63:23 becoming a lot easier
63:26 you're trying to find the truth in all
63:28 things
63:29 you're trying to redevelop sciences to
63:32 be true
63:34 you're trying to figure out the social
63:36 structure and
63:37 substrate of humanity so that we can
63:39 understand why we
63:40 are so easily gullible into hating each
63:43 other
63:44 you're trying to figure out everything
63:46 does your toothpaste have fluoride that
63:48 rots your pineal gland in your teeth
63:50 you're trying to figure these things out
63:52 does a microwave actually pulverize
63:55 food compounds into food elements that
63:56 become toxic in your body
63:58 but as you're trying to safeguard
64:01 yourself first your family next
64:03 and the world third
64:06 you have this group of people who are
64:09 unwilling to go through any stage of the
64:10 kubleros effect
64:12 and they are your obstacle
64:15 they are the inertia of the universe
64:18 that stops the molecule from shaking
64:20 from the idea going to the next brain
64:24 because their butt they're children
64:27 in my opinion we all have a little kid
64:30 inside of ourselves right
64:31 we almost all of us do right i'm not
64:33 sure i was ever born with one but
64:35 i can go to disneyland and have a good
64:37 time
64:39 that probably makes me a kid i see
64:42 through all the commercialism that's
64:43 been wrapped around every single
64:44 ride and i see walt disney do i ever see
64:47 walt disney
64:49 but uh you know it was uh written in the
64:53 bible that
64:53 christ told us to be childlike
64:57 and i think there's some point in the in
64:59 the bible in the new testament where he
65:00 says
65:01 obviously where he's pointing at a kid
65:03 and he tells someone you know be like
65:05 that kid
65:06 and it's a very interesting thing to say
65:08 that because it's a very risky thing to
65:09 say that right
65:11 what you're saying don't mature don't
65:13 grow up i don't think that's what he was
65:15 saying
65:16 or the writers of the book
65:19 they're saying don't lose your goal of
65:23 ideology of optimism
65:27 everyone knows that well there's that
65:30 saying right
65:32 life's a [ __ ] and then you die i hate
65:35 that
65:36 saying more than you could possibly
65:37 imagine
65:39 because that is spoken by someone who
65:41 lost their inner child a long time ago
65:43 right they had a bad stage in life
65:47 and they died or they saw people die or
65:49 whatever they think that's the way it
65:51 goes
65:51 and so they demonize every moment that
65:53 they're alive
65:54 that their suffering is just what it is
65:57 it has to be suffering
65:58 and you can never get out of it and then
66:00 you die
66:01 well i think most of us at least in our
66:03 30s or 40s we have one person from our
66:06 childhood from high school whatever
66:08 that has no clue what that means
66:11 they lived a charmed life they had great
66:13 parents a great world
66:15 they've had a great job they had the
66:17 family
66:19 maybe the wife stays home the entire
66:20 time i got a buddy of mine from the game
66:22 industry i got him in the game industry
66:23 a long time ago
66:24 he has lived one of those great lives
66:26 now he struggled with his job and from
66:28 time to time because the game industry
66:29 is
66:30 up and down constantly but he always
66:31 lands on his feet he's landed on his
66:33 feet recently
66:34 plenty of money in the bank he's
66:36 accomplished a tremendous amount of
66:37 things he's worked on all kinds of
66:39 name brand video games
66:43 if i walked up to him and said life's a
66:44 [ __ ] and then you die he would look at
66:46 me like what's wrong
66:47 are you are you depressed is that why
66:49 you're telling me that
66:50 right he knows i would be projecting my
66:52 own internal loss
66:55 towards him i don't feel it's like that
66:57 way at all
66:58 but i i i worry
67:02 that folks that can't explore the moon
67:05 hoax information that just the smoking
67:07 guns after smoking guns
67:09 that they believe that if they were to
67:11 believe one fact
67:13 one smoking gun about the moon missions
67:15 not being real that they believe the
67:17 world turns into life's a [ __ ] and then
67:18 you die
67:20 and it's not the truth at all you know
67:23 when you're a kid don't you remember
67:24 your well some of you don't but
67:26 i think the majority hopefully of you do
67:28 you had a great time when you were a kid
67:32 for all of its bumps and scrapes and
67:34 bruises you had a really good time when
67:36 you were a kid
67:37 whatever you did and then you look back
67:40 on that and we reminisce right
67:42 like oh god it was so fun to be in high
67:43 school it was so fun to be whatever
67:45 whatever age was your favorite age
67:48 but you you know all good things come to
67:50 an end is what they say too
67:53 well it's no doubt that life brings you
67:57 you know sour grapes every once in a
67:58 while but that's why you can enjoy the
68:00 bowl of cherries every once in a while
68:02 because you know i just think that we
68:05 have to have the courage
68:07 to grow up and we do not have to
68:10 demonize everything simply because
68:12 something didn't turn out to be
68:13 the way we were told the way we thought
68:15 it was going to go
68:16 right i hope you feel me on this episode
68:19 a lot of the comments are similar in
68:22 archetype
68:23 which is great
68:27 they will say they'll start off with a
68:28 line that says something like
68:31 what did it for me was boom boom boom
68:34 regardless of their education whether it
68:37 be a massive education someone's walking
68:38 around with a phd in
68:41 astrophysics or something or they're
68:43 just
68:44 a guy that works on carburetors all day
68:46 or a housewife that's raising
68:48 four kids there's something that they
68:51 see in the presented evidence of the
68:53 moon landings that makes them go
68:55 what yeah i don't think so
68:58 and that's the little thread in the
68:59 sweater that they pull and once they
69:01 pull it out the whole thing unravels
69:03 and you know again they might go through
69:04 various stages of emotional distress
69:07 but eventually they they come to grips
69:10 with it and the only thing that's really
69:11 frustrating
69:12 moving forward is that nasa hasn't been
69:15 reorganized to cease the line
69:18 like nasa could simply say hey
69:21 we're not on mars we're not circling
69:23 mars
69:24 we're not going to the moon anytime soon
69:27 it's just not our objective
69:28 not because we can't right you know they
69:31 can't but
69:32 they just stop lying right i think
69:35 i think as as human beings if you've
69:38 ever experimented as a child with
69:40 telling a fib
69:41 you realize right away you're creating a
69:44 very intense burden for yourself to
69:46 remember the lie
69:48 just remember okay well how did i how
69:49 did i say that and i got to say it again
69:51 this person heard me say it the first
69:52 time so they remember
69:53 everything because they think i was
69:54 lying and so their ears perked up while
69:56 my mind was trying to get away from the
69:58 lie
70:00 and eventually you cease lying because
70:03 it's a pain in the ass and so i don't
70:06 know
70:08 personally i mean if i were to be the
70:09 director of nasa
70:11 one of the very first covert meetings i
70:13 would have with my staff is to say
70:15 we have got to pull out of all these
70:17 lies that we're telling
70:19 we will find other ways of getting
70:22 funding
70:23 and doing things for the space program
70:26 and for humanity
70:27 that's not going to involve telling lies
70:30 right
70:31 but you know what would be the uh what
70:33 would be one of the number one projects
70:35 they would do
70:35 they would do a zero point energy system
70:37 project but now they have all these
70:39 bankers looking at them going
70:41 uh uh we value every monetary unit in
70:44 this planet
70:45 off of a barrel of oil that's
70:49 changing a little bit you know these as
70:50 countries are stockpiling gold and
70:52 there's the rumor that we're going to
70:53 switch over to gold
70:54 whatever until we do that switch
70:59 we can't disturb the energy system of
71:02 the world
71:03 it's got to be oil right it's a big
71:06 business
71:07 i have an episode called replacing nasa
71:09 i believe that's what i called it
71:11 and that's real important you know but
71:14 which is funny i think about about a
71:15 month after that episode released
71:17 uh donald trump came out with space
71:20 force
71:20 i thought that was poetic i'm sure
71:22 there's no connection whatsoever but
71:24 isn't that interesting there's a stream
71:25 of consciousness in the world that goes
71:27 you know and i mentioned this i didn't
71:29 give it a name but i said there needs to
71:30 be a military branch
71:32 of the space program and then the
71:34 present united states
71:35 a month later says it pretty cool right
71:39 that division of the space force doesn't
71:40 have to lie about anything except to
71:42 maybe
71:43 maybe push a little bit of propaganda
71:45 about our missiles our
71:46 bombs whatever technology that we have
71:49 to
71:50 to short-circuit wars from our enemies
71:53 who might say oh [ __ ] they've got that
71:56 well then either we have to have it or
71:57 we should just back off
71:59 politically diplomatically in the world
72:01 so that we don't create
72:03 animosity with that country i don't know
72:06 not the way i operate but i can
72:07 understand if they do it
72:09 if you're a person who believes went to
72:10 the moon don't you want to go back
72:13 and what excuses are you buying as to
72:16 why no other country's been able to put
72:17 a man on the moon
72:19 what excuses are you buying that america
72:22 can't go back to the moon
72:23 i mean we did it six times and it was
72:25 flawless
72:27 flawless only apollo 13 which has less
72:29 than a paragraph of information about
72:30 what the explosion was on the outside of
72:32 the capsule
72:33 that you know jeopardized the entire
72:35 mission which is all bunk
72:37 but whatever don't you want to go back
72:41 i do i want to be there for the first
72:43 time i want to see it
72:45 i want it to be so well oiled that it's
72:48 just a ticket you can buy
72:50 maybe it's 10 grand maybe it's 100 grand
72:52 but you could go
72:53 and you can get a spacesuit and you can
72:55 walk around on the moon
72:58 look at me mom no hands right if you
73:01 haven't been to deepthoughtsradio.com
73:02 that is the jump off point for this show
73:05 and really that's important if you want
73:06 to either do one of two things you want
73:08 to switch formats you want to have it in
73:09 your car as a podcast
73:12 or you want to get into some
73:13 conversations on our locked facebook
73:15 group
73:16 it grows steadily again we've had a
73:19 tremendous uptick in subscriptions for
73:21 season four
73:22 so that's very cool um there's there's
73:25 the patreon thing out there i
73:28 i only leave it up really because
73:32 it's in a lot of my bumpers and some
73:34 folks want to donate
73:35 it goes up and down you know sometimes
73:37 it's really funny the
73:38 dollar amount i think it just dropped i
73:40 think i lost about two people which is
73:42 really weird
73:43 i put out the most popular episode
73:46 that's been out there and i lost two
73:47 two patreon folks you know helps buy
73:50 cigars whatever
73:51 again the revenue off the channel i'll
73:53 just be very transparent with you guys
73:56 the average monthly take on youtube is
73:59 dollars um it says on my little
74:03 app that i'm up to twenty seven dollars
74:05 this month so that's the uh
74:07 it's almost doubled i mean that's cool
74:09 right i mean not doubled but it's uh
74:11 fifty percent higher than it was before
74:13 so that's interesting but those numbers
74:14 go back down right so it's estimating
74:16 if you keep this traffic up for the next
74:18 28 days this is what your paycheck is
74:20 going to be
74:21 and so they i think it has to get to 100
74:23 bucks before they actually shift it into
74:24 my account so it takes four months
74:28 well sorry it takes five months on
74:30 average for me to get
74:31 a buck out of the channel so it really
74:33 doesn't uh
74:34 register much but you know these cigars
74:37 are about uh
74:38 these these are about five bucks a piece
74:40 i bought a box of these for 110 dollars
74:43 25 sticks in the box so you know a
74:46 little bit of revenue
74:47 helps provide the uh the stinky stick
74:50 here
74:51 for anyone interested in cigars you
74:53 don't smoke them
74:54 definitely see my episode on cigars it's
74:56 not watched that very much
74:58 that very much and i'm probably going to
75:00 do an episode all about
75:01 cuban cigars this year so if you have
75:04 any interest keep your eyes out for that
75:06 episode coming out
75:07 regardless thank you for coming thank
75:09 you for supporting the show i appreciate
75:11 every single one of you whether you
75:12 believe what i say or not it doesn't
75:14 matter
75:15 take care of yourself and someone else
75:17 and i'll see you in the next deep
75:18 thoughts
75:19 over now
75:25 [Music]
75:34 you
