00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentlemen on this beautiful Sunday
00:33 afternoon it's about 90 degrees outside
00:37 last week it was in the low to mid 50s
00:40 and that just tells you how much man can
00:46 survive and giant swings of heat and
00:50 here we are worried about global warming
00:53 [ __ ]
00:54 it's the icebergs man today we're gonna
00:58 talk about something I'm gonna call old
01:00 America and this is sort of reminiscent
01:03 sort of an extension episode to the
01:06 episode on life before 9/11 but I
01:10 thought I would take a more meticulous
01:11 dive instead of just just covering the
01:14 sort of highlights of the way it was
01:17 this will be a tale for young people to
01:20 hear sort of how we used to live our
01:23 life and it'll be sort of a Renaissance
01:27 ash nostalgic moment for folks that are
01:30 my age or older which would probably
01:32 start start really hitting you 45 and up
01:37 but the overall goal and arc of this
01:40 particular show is to to maybe think
01:45 about whether or not we had it right at
01:50 various times in society and I will
01:54 preface that by saying not maybe
01:57 everything right but certain things
01:59 right it certainly felt like we had
02:02 everything right a couple times as far
02:04 as I can tell but I'm also going to dial
02:08 back and start from eras that I
02:10 personally did not live in using my
02:14 relatives and some of my friends who
02:18 grew up in those decades prior to my own
02:23 inception because there there are things
02:29 that we can reverse-engineer from their
02:31 shock and awe of their life and the
02:35 changes of this world right and even
02:37 though this is going to be oldham
02:38 it really is sort of a generic archetype
02:43 of anyone living in any other country
02:45 you could do your episode on this you
02:48 know this is what England was like oh
02:49 yeah and this is Australia or wherever
02:51 right Europe not to exclude any other
02:57 zone in the world what's really strange
03:00 about America as I understand it as I
03:03 have tried to dissect and in reform
03:08 history based on one the published
03:11 history of America which is god-awful 80
03:15 percent revised history and then sort of
03:18 eyewitness recollections of history that
03:22 are much different and usually in some
03:25 cases much more primitive and simple and
03:28 beautiful and in other ways more
03:30 outrageous and horrible so you know
03:34 history is written to to put in fanciful
03:38 stories that never happened to make
03:40 things look better and then it's revised
03:44 to conceal criminal activity and the
03:47 unthinkable right so when in the late
03:51 eighteen hundreds in America we were
03:54 capturing newborn children at a
03:56 particular age like they would be taken
03:58 from their parents there at the ripe age
04:01 of like six or seven or they would be
04:03 taken from their parents at Birth put
04:04 into foster care kind of Oliver Twist
04:06 little orphanages then when they get to
04:09 work age that you put on a train shift
04:12 off to some factory worked literally to
04:14 death that's something that we conceal
04:19 and so then people get misunderstandings
04:22 about child labor laws you know and then
04:24 when a child who's 7 years old wants to
04:26 help pick up the leaves around the yard
04:28 you got some you know idiot neighbor
04:32 calling the police
04:33 because the kids working and then that
04:37 same idiot neighbor will call the police
04:39 when the kid grows up to be completely
04:41 entitled and a piece of [ __ ]
04:44 you know it steals from them because
04:46 they can't get a job because they were
04:47 never allowed to work to develop a work
04:49 ethic you know well today tell you the
04:54 furthest I can personally go back based
04:56 on a sort of history of families and
05:02 then the stories because there's I grew
05:05 up in the Midwest so I heard plenty of
05:06 little farm stories and Prairie stories
05:08 not only from books that they might read
05:11 us when I was young which definitely
05:13 happened but also from the farmers from
05:17 the family members who want to let us
05:18 know how long they've been in Chanute
05:20 Kansas where I'm from you know what it
05:24 was called before it was called that
05:26 how'd this whole railroad community came
05:28 about with the Santa Fe Railroad line
05:30 and then we'll migrate into the 20th
05:35 century but in the 19th century which is
05:39 the 1800s you have you know that the
05:44 first thing to remember is you have no
05:48 amenities really the amenities you
05:50 create the amenities you have or the
05:53 amenities that you create and to there's
05:55 something very fascinating about the
05:59 settlers that moved into America now you
06:02 know we know that the Native Americans
06:04 were here first and that their tale of
06:07 disappearing has been largely messed
06:09 with we'll get to that in a sec here
06:11 because it's it's sort of simple and
06:13 dark but to take the Europeans who were
06:16 in Europe potentially living in
06:19 full-fledged cities with amenities
06:23 running water and transportation and
06:26 science okay
06:27 and then the folks get to America they
06:31 come over here you know I have two
06:33 strands of family I have one that came
06:34 over in 1630 and then when that came
06:37 over in the early 1800s two different
06:39 families came over in early 1800s so two
06:42 came over in the 1600s and two came over
06:43 in 1800 respectively different the same
06:47 side of the families or have the two the
06:49 two different groups so they experienced
06:51 a completely different lifestyle but
06:56 when they got to the Midwest
06:57 you know I have quite a few German
07:00 relatives like 3/4 pretty much German I
07:04 think the fourth that I have is half
07:05 German half Welsh or something but I
07:08 don't have the the family that's you
07:12 know your Phil Collins head my family is
07:16 more like Dick Van Dyke blood you know
07:18 but they came here and they they came to
07:20 the Midwest in Kansas and I think that
07:23 having observed Germany as an adult
07:26 there was a reason because rolling hills
07:29 and Germany and rolling hills in Kansas
07:32 are very similar so they finally get to
07:33 the point where it feels like their
07:35 world and of course there's giant
07:38 mountains and both countries but they
07:41 get there and they settle and they're
07:42 becoming farmers brutal winters brutal
07:47 summers more brutal because we don't
07:50 have super easy ways of heating shelters
07:54 and cooling shelters especially cooling
07:56 cooling was nothing magic cooling was a
07:58 matter of standing in the shade and
08:00 hitting yourself with like a paper fan
08:02 you know we're talking no electricity
08:05 because for a giant swab of my history's
08:09 life both sides electricity wasn't a
08:11 commodity you could just buy you have no
08:14 hope about making it so it's important
08:18 about this and I know it might sound
08:20 almost ridiculous this episode so far
08:22 but the idea is to say what is the daily
08:24 life of an American in the 1800s in the
08:27 Midwest right because the East Coast was
08:30 very well developed the amenities came
08:34 over quickly because the European
08:37 aristocracy didn't want to go without
08:39 what they have you know it's like going
08:40 on on a camping trip with your color
08:42 television your flat-screen television
08:45 and your cell phone and every in your
08:47 hot spot in your your laptop that's sort
08:51 of how the the oligarchy came over the
08:54 Masons came over with all their stuff
08:56 but in the Midwest she had nothing and
08:58 there was you know it's rhyme from so
09:01 there's a beauty to this what happens
09:06 when you are without power at your house
09:09 there was a little
09:11 to this and the end of the movie Cable
09:13 Guy where you have cage from Tenacious D
09:17 who's playing a little bit role at the
09:19 very end when the television goes out at
09:22 the very end and there's nothing else to
09:26 do cage takes a book and opens it and
09:28 picks it up and he starts reading and
09:30 it's just hilarious that that's a simple
09:32 thing that happens now we used to live
09:34 in that pocket or if you weren't working
09:37 you're usually sleeping and what you fit
09:40 fitted in between was essentially maybe
09:42 you went to church if you had one when
09:46 you had a book it was it was the movie
09:50 to open up the pages and read it and the
09:53 beautiful thing about a book as opposed
09:55 to a movie is if we watch you know Thor
09:59 Ragnar off or whatever you sit down and
10:02 watch it I sit down and watch it and
10:03 when we look at it someone else is
10:05 deciding the imagery for us Industrial
10:08 Light and Magic what uh whatever right
10:11 but when you read a book
10:13 I see Gandalf one way you see Gandalf
10:16 the other way and as much as Tolkien
10:17 might describe what Gandalf looks like
10:19 and he did do it I'm just an amazing job
10:23 describing this guy because I painted
10:24 the end off as a kid before I saw Ralph
10:27 Bakshi's Lord of the Rings and we're all
10:31 deciding it's it's the same it's amazing
10:33 how well he did but there are plenty of
10:36 interpretations from a book that you
10:38 simply create in your mind to complete
10:44 the picture and someone else is creating
10:46 a different image so that gives you an
10:49 idea of the primitive nature and the
10:51 benefits of less is more sort of
10:53 mentality okay today you can go to the
10:57 grocery store I mean if you want to eat
11:00 chicken tonight you just buy chicken you
11:01 want to beef beef you want to be
11:03 vegetarian knock yourself out if you
11:05 want a big tub of ice cream you want
11:07 special velvet whatever cupcakes there's
11:15 nothing that's gonna stop you nothing
11:18 that's gonna stop you you're gonna be
11:19 able to find everything you ever wanted
11:21 if you had a ton of money you could buy
11:23 an expensive car
11:25 regular car you could take bus to get to
11:27 work you can do these things you can
11:29 walk in the Midwest in the 19th century
11:33 you don't have a lot of choices because
11:36 you have to you know usually hunt your
11:39 own animal half the time you have to
11:42 build your house I mean the funny thing
11:45 is is that men knew how to build a house
11:47 you just had that knowledge you couldn't
11:49 be a settler if you didn't know how to
11:51 lay a foundation and then build a house
11:53 on it and that's why a lot of these
11:55 places fell down over time because they
11:57 didn't have you know big concrete slabs
11:59 and reinforced Rou bar in there so was
12:04 just wood on a level floor on a level
12:07 you know piece of dirt and of course
12:10 over time the earth shifts and these
12:13 things fall apart
12:14 when you watch Deadwood on HBO set in
12:17 South Dakota Deadwood South Dakota you
12:20 know it's a fictional it's sort of a
12:22 fictional recap of what actually
12:24 happened there but one of the things
12:26 that I always thought the entire time is
12:28 when the when the sworen character talks
12:31 about probably season 2 about having
12:33 built the place but there's bare hands
12:36 that's why season 1 you start to go you
12:39 know it's a fictional comment but the
12:41 real surgeon and the real people that
12:43 did it they did they they cut down trees
12:45 they they cut them they planed them and
12:48 they built all their boards right it's
12:50 phenomenal I don't think there's a guy
12:53 out there who considers himself a male
12:55 an alpha male that doesn't want those
12:57 skills a lot of you actually have those
13:00 skills that I have a lot of house
13:01 builders in my family I you know took
13:04 woodshop a couple times we built a
13:06 corner of a house and I was about it I
13:08 think that's a bummer that I don't have
13:11 more knowledge to do more with that but
13:15 the average household was a very simple
13:16 household
13:17 no one was weak because you couldn't be
13:22 male/female didn't matter young old
13:24 didn't matter you could not be weak you
13:27 couldn't because you had to get up first
13:29 thing in the morning and you had to
13:32 start working before the Sun came up and
13:35 the interesting thing was that the girls
13:38 had their
13:38 things that they did and the boys had
13:40 the things that they did and of course
13:41 you got a tomboy every once a while that
13:43 wants to jump over the fence and get out
13:46 and help sometimes you just have to for
13:49 all this
13:50 Rockefeller [ __ ] about women dying
13:52 in childbirth before they so graced us
13:55 with you know $15,000 births and
13:58 hospitals putting us in the most
14:00 compromising positions on planet earth
14:01 to deliver a baby out of a uterus which
14:03 now has resulted in c-sections women
14:06 created children constantly without any
14:10 problem
14:10 the amount of Midwestern family shots
14:13 with ten to twenty children is very very
14:18 common very common mothers would start
14:23 between the age of 14 and 16 the
14:25 husband's were 16 to 18 a couple years
14:28 ahead
14:28 usually they cranked him all out she was
14:31 usually done by 30 early 30s then they
14:35 had their kids I had them and they used
14:37 them to work agriculture there's still
14:40 many places in the world that do this
14:42 India South America Eastern Asia I often
14:48 talk about you know when we start
14:50 reading started having books read to us
14:52 when we were young in school in Kansas
14:55 you know the whole thing about getting
14:57 sugar it was such a big deal several
15:01 books several stories about hey it's
15:04 going to be someone's birthday and so
15:05 the father goes into town to buy just
15:07 enough sugar to make the one cake I
15:11 didn't I don't remember even hearing
15:13 about cookies it was just a cake and it
15:16 wasn't a gigantic sheet cake you know it
15:18 was like maybe a eight inch dual layered
15:22 cake or something you didn't get that
15:25 much and I'm I'm willing to bet that if
15:28 we ate the cake from the 1800s we would
15:31 kind of go whoa that's pretty sour it's
15:33 pretty flowery right I'm willing to bet
15:35 the amount of sugar that they put in
15:37 those cakes didn't have to be that much
15:38 because they weren't drinking coke are
15:39 all day long and eating Twinkies right
15:42 but life was tough there weren't a lot
15:46 of inventions the law was sort of
15:48 sketchy
15:49 you had your Hatfields in you're McCoys
15:53 and Salina Kansas fighting over who's
15:57 heard was whose and that's when they
15:58 started branding Cal's to make sure that
16:01 if you stole a cow you couldn't get that
16:04 brand off the cow man it was burned into
16:06 their flesh the families that couldn't
16:09 survive perished they usually didn't
16:13 have the means to move away they just
16:16 came out here and perished lucky ones
16:20 maybe lived next to a railroad and got
16:22 to go back east to enjoy the softer
16:24 amenities of the world right and before
16:28 I go too much further in this story
16:29 every single one of you that can hear my
16:32 voice has at least the recessive gene of
16:36 these tough hombres these tough human
16:40 beings that have done all this otherwise
16:41 you wouldn't exist your mom's side of
16:44 the family has it and your dad's side of
16:45 the family has it now you could be
16:47 called for the last hundred years or
16:48 whatever and a lot of that's gone into a
16:51 recessive mode but you can shock it back
16:56 into reality but America was a sort of a
17:01 lawless weird you know law of the jungle
17:06 decade in decade out world until
17:10 probably we're hitting the the late
17:14 teens early 20s where the railroad was
17:18 able to spread the amenities of all
17:20 kinds cars and and supplies and you know
17:25 lumber could come from one side of the
17:26 world and go complete the other side of
17:28 the world and vice versa
17:30 once the takeover of America sadly from
17:35 the Native Americans was complete then
17:37 the amount of overall war that just
17:41 messed with you know the daily living
17:44 and daily migration to the West had
17:47 settled down just to put a fine point on
17:50 the Native American knowledge that I
17:53 have you know it's it's one of these
17:56 things where you can study it for
17:58 decades and still feel like maybe you
18:02 don't know a single thing the
18:05 18 knowledge that I think feels more
18:09 correct to me about the Native American
18:12 massacre and sort of genocide of their
18:15 people and on this continent is that you
18:19 have sort of a and I don't mean to
18:23 scapegoat this but you know I guarantee
18:27 and my family didn't have anything to do
18:29 with this conquering conquest here you
18:34 have the conquistadors but are coming in
18:37 from Spain and they were just some
18:41 violent violent human beings and they
18:45 couldn't have done what they did without
18:47 being violent but they also had
18:49 technology that was sort of supernatural
18:51 compared to what the native people here
18:54 had you know horses didn't exist here
18:57 obviously gunpowder guns swords did not
19:04 exist and so imagine that power of being
19:09 able to quickly move in with a cavalry
19:11 and attack someone who's on foot you can
19:15 run as long as you you're not burn as
19:16 much as you want the Native Americans as
19:18 I have been told did not have any
19:20 semblance of the wheel they move things
19:24 on sleds and you'll see this from time
19:27 to time in historical pieces what they
19:30 want you to believe is that there was an
19:32 accident that influenza and smallpox and
19:36 various other light-weight illnesses for
19:38 Europeans got into the bloodstream of
19:41 Native Americans and that is the reason
19:44 why most of them died seems a little
19:47 convenient doesn't it but when you look
19:50 at the conquistadors having swept across
19:54 South America and and the massacres of
19:56 South America are extremely well
19:58 documented and when they come up into
20:02 sort of your California Arizona New
20:05 Mexico area today and they swept up and
20:09 then started heading east again they're
20:11 looking for the city made of gold which
20:13 is obviously a city made of clay that
20:16 when the Sun hits at a magic hour
20:19 it looks gold and so there was a Trent
20:21 lost in translation thing which I can
20:23 only imagine made them infuriated enough
20:25 to kill even more people you look at the
20:28 Shoshone Indians massacred by the
20:30 Mormons nearly 500 people were massacred
20:36 because the Shoshone Indians used to go
20:38 in this big circle this big nomadic
20:40 circle so winter winter time they'd go
20:42 south summertime they'd go north but
20:45 because we had moved in and cut them off
20:47 from this rotation they're sitting up
20:49 there in Utah in the wintertime trying
20:52 to survive and again like I've said
20:55 another episodes it's sort of like the
20:56 the wasp nests that's frozen they can't
20:59 move you could pet a wasp in a in the
21:02 wintertime if you can find him and they
21:06 were murdered and then it's covered up
21:09 and I met the the great-granddaughter of
21:13 the only surviving woman from that tribe
21:17 she was one of the most beautiful women
21:20 I've ever met in my life
21:21 and she's pure blood native-american so
21:25 it's there's almost this anxiety as an
21:27 American with the tale of the Native
21:29 Americans and the fact that I'm sitting
21:31 here on soil that not only was well you
21:34 know the native Native folks were the
21:36 Native Americans you have your Aztecs
21:38 that you know work sort of a hybrid of a
21:40 friend of mine as an Aztec and he talks
21:42 about it at length of them being sort of
21:44 a hybrid the Mexican culture is a hybrid
21:48 but the real SuperDuper native folks in
21:52 in all my research are the Native
21:54 Americans there's a lot of Mexican
21:56 citizens that are almost they look pure
21:58 blood Native American right I personally
22:01 believe they ended up going up the coast
22:04 of Alaska and over into Asia I don't
22:07 think it came the other way because if
22:08 that was a case for me most of Eurasia
22:12 would be Asian and not Middle Eastern
22:15 and sort of this kind of Russian mix
22:18 between Asian and white people
22:20 definitely at this point they're totally
22:22 different races you know genetically
22:24 speaking it's amazing how this stuff
22:26 happens right but there's a ningke's
22:28 that you almost can't take ownership for
22:29 it like I can't take ownership for what
22:32 happened there and
22:33 so the people that did it are gone
22:35 they're totally and completely removed
22:37 from this planet there's not Spaniards
22:41 over in Spain they can say my ancestors
22:44 did this necessarily I mean there's so
22:45 many generations gone and who knows what
22:48 happened to the so the land pirates that
22:50 took this place right
22:52 but obviously America had the civil war
22:54 and I won't belabor that because I'm
22:57 gonna make a sort of revisionist history
22:59 episode I think I've done one a long
23:02 time ago but I'm gonna put together a
23:03 much better one but what I'm really
23:06 looking at is the transformation of
23:08 prosperity and the consciousness of
23:11 Americans how do we keep going and how
23:14 do we reinvent ourselves because the
23:16 next fun era of America you know is
23:21 probably about the time that Charlie
23:22 Chaplin started making movies about 1915
23:25 you know this guy was just a phenomenal
23:31 storyteller filmmaker he was a pantomime
23:35 of sorts he made so much money back in
23:40 those days it was utterly astonishing I
23:42 think he actually had ratcheted up his
23:44 salary to ten thousand dollars a week
23:47 and then when he took over and made his
23:49 own film companies making like a hundred
23:50 thousand dollars a week in the teens and
23:52 20s I mean my grandmother in nineteen
23:55 forty two decades later was making like
23:58 40 bucks a month so that's Charlie
24:03 Chaplin was a baller right and he
24:05 remained a good guy right what's
24:07 interesting growing up in the Midwest
24:09 and the 70s which is my first decade of
24:11 life is that anytime that you think
24:17 about a decade in your brain the
24:21 layman's thing that we all do when we're
24:22 young is thinking okay if I was going to
24:24 make a movie set in 1975
24:29 that I would go look online for all the
24:32 props and objects made in 1975 and I
24:35 would fill a whole house with 1975 but
24:38 obviously that's not the way it works a
24:40 household in the Midwest especially
24:42 because they respect you know the
24:46 lineage of their families they'll have a
24:48 kitchen table that was made in 1850 I
24:51 used to have a kitchen table in my house
24:52 made in 1850 from a family member so you
24:58 you have a household full of decades
25:01 worth of goods in your home in the 70s
25:04 because of a couple things one like I
25:07 said the family member builds something
25:09 even though it's not the most pretty
25:10 thing in the world it is something that
25:12 your great-grandfather built and so man
25:13 you're literally sitting on the geometry
25:15 decisions of a relative it's really cool
25:18 right but the other thing that was
25:21 possible is that we weren't in this
25:23 planned obsolescence that we are today
25:26 and so we actually had a radio that
25:29 would last a hundred years we had a lamp
25:32 that would last I mean geez I we don't
25:35 even know when some of these lamps are
25:36 gonna be needing to be destroyed because
25:39 there's still one hundred percent
25:40 perfect to this day yeah you might redo
25:42 a few of the wires here and there but if
25:44 you look at the gauge of a wire that
25:47 that comes out of one of these lamps
25:49 from 1930 these kind of arts and crafts
25:51 looking things these art deco pieces it
25:55 will take thousands of years before this
25:58 wires going to lose any of its
26:00 conductive properties and so maybe the
26:04 the the rubber insulation which in the
26:08 back in the day was a lot of it was
26:09 cloth with rubber kind of spray on it or
26:13 something
26:14 stuff will last forever so in the 70s in
26:17 the Midwest you have sort of a poorer
26:19 community they can't afford to go out
26:22 and buy a bunch of stuff but the other
26:23 thing is that the community wasn't
26:24 convinced by any stretch of the
26:26 imagination that buying this
26:28 obsolescence from current products was
26:32 better than hanging onto your your
26:33 grandfather's you know the what is it
26:38 the Apple peelers your grandmother's
26:39 grater maybe your grandmother's in the
26:44 you know blenders and there's this whole
26:47 reprisal that's been going on for a
26:48 couple decades where people actually
26:49 spending a lot more money buying
26:51 products that are mocked after designs
26:54 from the 40s and 50s and even the 30s
26:59 because you get quality out of it right
27:02 it's really nice as we think about
27:05 rebuilding America sort of in that you
27:08 know yep make America great again it's
27:11 not going to be just a bunch of
27:12 immediate policies that will fix the
27:14 economy affects education fix health
27:17 it's going to be reengineering the brain
27:19 of an American citizen to stop for a
27:23 second take some inventory over what it
27:25 was like to make quality products right
27:28 and I've got an episode called the
27:30 American Way which focuses on this
27:31 planned obsolescence I don't want to
27:33 completely regurgitated episode but that
27:36 is a big giant part of it and that's
27:38 what it was like when I was growing up
27:41 the the other big thing that comes with
27:47 that is is that poverty it's a it's a
27:50 very interesting thing when we move to
27:53 say coastal regions with a lot of money
27:55 and again you have that coastal house
27:58 like I just recently mentioned with the
28:00 Bentley and the Aventador and the big
28:03 beach that's there's what have you you
28:06 start setting your bar of minimum
28:09 happiness at these sort of infinite
28:11 levels that don't make any sense when
28:14 those folks get the bills to pay for all
28:16 those toys they have a bad day and it
28:20 doesn't matter if they are a billionaire
28:22 or just a millionaire they have a bad
28:25 day when that bill arrives when I go
28:29 back to the Midwest and visit my friends
28:32 there's this amazing beauty of they
28:37 don't care about how fancy stuff is they
28:41 just want it to be functional and the
28:44 beautiful thing is I can assure you and
28:46 there's a lot of you who do this too I
28:48 do this as to my my to the extent I
28:51 possibly can you realize it's not
28:55 necessarily the stuff that's making you
28:57 the slice but happy it has the
28:59 performance function can your can your
29:01 kitchen oven make something hot enough
29:04 to consider it cooked yes does the roof
29:07 leak no you know does the closet hold my
29:11 clothes yes do you have a coffee table
29:15 yep now what they're not asking
29:18 themselves is does my oven cook it as
29:21 fast as humanly possible is it as pretty
29:24 and as shiny as all the stuff I see on
29:27 television does my house have an extra
29:30 2,000 square feet that I don't need does
29:33 my closet door have a really shiny
29:35 mirror on it
29:36 I don't really ask these questions and
29:39 in my opinion they shouldn't just live
29:44 just be when you go back in your mind
29:48 and you think about all the things that
29:49 matter in life very very very seldom do
29:53 you have an isolated moment by yourself
29:56 that is your grand Epiphany of Boyde my
30:00 whole life was this moment here by
30:03 myself
30:04 not a single soul knew that it happened
30:05 and I and you didn't tell anybody that
30:08 it happened because it was such an
30:10 isolated moment of wonder it's great now
30:12 there are exceptions to that you know
30:14 you can defeat a demon in your life an
30:18 addiction or something like that and
30:21 you'll have those beautiful moments for
30:22 sure but overall it's usually the birth
30:25 of a child getting married getting
30:28 engaged kissing someone on the lips that
30:31 you love giving getting getting a hug
30:33 when you haven't had one or whatever
30:35 arriving back home after being deployed
30:37 at war and never knowing if you're gonna
30:38 ever come home it's usually an
30:42 interaction with another human being
30:44 that makes life have that purpose you're
30:49 a giver and you're you're a nurse or a
30:51 doctor or a fireman or a police officer
30:54 or anything you just serve coffee and
30:56 that just makes smiles happen you know
31:02 when I think about old America there's a
31:06 sort of a suite of things that come into
31:08 my mind
31:09 this sort of cloudy image this Gestalt
31:11 of of what that means to me and there's
31:14 a certain yearning I have to say I hope
31:18 that Gen Z you know the kids that are
31:20 being born today they're really really
31:22 young kids are going to reprise this to
31:24 a great extent which is to say this
31:29 globalism thing of having to get all
31:31 your [ __ ] made from another country has
31:32 got to end it has to end because you're
31:37 gonna have to have jobs that keep you
31:39 employed and your children and their
31:41 children children they're gonna have to
31:42 have something that keeps them going and
31:45 there's just something beautiful about
31:49 something that your country can create
31:51 for itself you know China makes a lot of
31:55 stuff today and regardless of whether or
31:57 not they're getting paid properly or
32:00 being able to sleep or sorry being able
32:02 to like complete eight-hour days and go
32:03 to sleep and have the life there has to
32:06 be a tremendous amount of pride that
32:08 they are building a giant portion of
32:11 every object in the world right now this
32:13 is their heyday and I think every single
32:17 country that can hear my voice has had
32:19 their heyday or something great happen
32:22 hopefully your countries in that ad but
32:24 America is having to rediscover it there
32:27 very few objects that are made in
32:29 America today over the last 20 years
32:32 that I can say very specifically it's
32:35 been going on forever but over the last
32:36 20 years there's been several attempts
32:38 to say our products made in America they
32:41 put a big giant you know badge on there
32:43 with an American flag kind of shrunk
32:45 down and you you're almost shocked as an
32:49 American citizen you look and you go oh
32:50 my god really someone was able to make
32:51 something in America our current
32:54 president really understands the overall
32:59 ecosystem of mental health that comes
33:01 with that label because people want to
33:05 feel like they're useful you know one of
33:09 the sad things I see happening in at
33:14 least in America I won't say anywhere
33:16 else probably does other places too is
33:18 that older people get to a point
33:22 where they they're crossing this
33:26 threshold of being worried that they
33:28 don't have any value and so there is
33:33 this interesting little twist some of
33:36 them just concede and give up and go
33:38 into retirement and they sort of allow
33:41 the system to take care of them some of
33:43 them are happy with that result some of
33:44 them are not happy with that result but
33:46 there I think is probably over 51% of
33:50 them who are hitting I would say 70 they
33:54 start to realize subconsciously if not
33:57 consciously that man I got a get out of
34:00 bed and do something with my life
34:02 because if I don't I'm dying and I'm
34:05 gonna tell you right now retirement is
34:07 the fastest way to lobotomize yourself
34:11 fastest way it lobotomize is your soul
34:14 if you're a man it emasculates you if
34:17 you're a woman I don't know I don't know
34:19 how to it just makes you feel insecure
34:24 about yourself and so if you are so
34:27 privileged to stop working as a man date
34:30 you must find projects and a brand-new
34:33 job an eight-hour day job you have to
34:36 because you have to be solving problems
34:39 with your brain otherwise you will die
34:40 of dementia your brain your body the
34:44 whole thing it says if you don't use
34:47 this then I guess we don't need it so
34:49 I'll just let it go and you know doing
34:54 this show and then the MKULTRA radio
34:56 show for two years before this and
34:59 getting detoxified off all the aspartame
35:02 and fluoride and all the other crap that
35:04 I was ingesting at the time losing 20
35:07 pounds plus which had only temporarily
35:10 had put on but still my mind has never
35:14 felt more invincible since I've been
35:16 alive and I always was afraid I'm not
35:20 deeply afraid but a little concerned as
35:22 a young man that geez you know when do I
35:24 start losing my mind and at this pace my
35:27 brain will be even twice as intense ten
35:29 years from now but I've seen to get back
35:32 on point over my in my direction here
35:35 I've seen folks that there's there's two
35:38 sides of the coin I've seen I work with
35:40 a lot of gentlemen that are much older
35:41 than me 20 years older 30 years older
35:44 and I've seen them kick into high gear
35:47 and try to take on a tremendous amount
35:50 of burden that even if they were 25 and
35:54 a brainiac they probably couldn't handle
35:57 but they're older and they don't quite
35:59 know where to draw the lines anymore
36:01 they look back at the these illustrious
36:02 careers that they've had and like man I
36:04 could do some stuff done some stuff and
36:06 so they keep piling stuff on a piling
36:08 stuff on until they break and then the
36:10 break makes them really insecure because
36:12 they are thinking oh my god I am getting
36:14 old so old I can't do what I need to do
36:16 for a living and it's not true they've
36:18 just overburdened themselves out of a
36:20 panic to feel useful for those of you
36:23 who have relatives that are older or we
36:27 either beat your grandparents or your
36:28 parents like if you're my age it's very
36:32 important that you don't destroy the
36:35 value of what your parents are trying to
36:37 do what I mean by that well if your
36:41 parent is trying to help you out in a
36:43 very traditional way that they used to
36:45 help you about when you were young and
36:46 you're sitting there in your 40s and
36:48 you're going mom dad why are you doing
36:51 this like I'm a grown man at this point
36:53 I'm a grown woman at this point I don't
36:55 really need you to babysit me like this
36:58 what's probably occurring is that they
37:01 are having this this moment where
37:03 they're trying to just be useful to you
37:06 in traditional manners that they
37:07 understand maybe they are an old dog and
37:10 they haven't learned any new tricks so
37:12 the method by which they help you is the
37:14 only methods that they understand I want
37:18 to just kind of say that so it heightens
37:19 your sensitivity to tolerate what might
37:22 be a little bit comical to you right so
37:28 far I've seen this more than I've
37:30 experienced this my parents are still
37:32 very lucid folks all my grandparents are
37:35 gone I was very fortunate that my
37:37 grandparents were very observant in
37:40 their later years they weren't trying to
37:43 really you know intervene or contribute
37:47 in any major way other than to
37:48 in their eyes and ears and just listen
37:50 to what their grandson was doing that is
37:53 also part of the older way of of America
37:58 we didn't overburden our citizens so
38:01 much right a woman usually went to work
38:04 usually unless she had a large family
38:06 but you know the the housewife that
38:08 totally sat around yeah you know in my
38:11 hometown maybe it was it was over 51%
38:13 but it wasn't probably over 60% a lot of
38:17 women just you know they just had their
38:19 children and then they went into the
38:20 workforce they went either got their
38:23 degrees had their children then use a
38:25 degree or they had their children early
38:27 then got the degree and went off and did
38:28 something or they didn't have to get a
38:29 degree you know the degree today
38:31 obviously has it's almost comical when a
38:37 an employer says must have this degree
38:40 yeah if you're a doctor and you're gonna
38:43 start cutting people open and
38:44 prescribing medicine yeah you need to
38:46 have a degree but there's so many jobs
38:48 out there that are so remedial that a
38:51 degree is is nice but won't we look at
38:54 the experience of the individual first
38:55 right but I want to bring up something
38:59 that is it is almost hard to understand
39:03 which is and I don't mean it to
39:05 understand as the concept of it but to
39:09 really perhaps that's not a good word
39:11 perhaps it's to decipher the truth of
39:13 what really was and that is the overall
39:17 sort of tone and gullibility and
39:21 sweetness of humanity in each decade of
39:26 say the 20th century
39:28 so the 1900s right it's it's trackable
39:34 in America because of Hollywood and
39:37 television now we all know that some of
39:40 these virtually you know the majority of
39:43 these have a character church spin on
39:45 things right so Leave It to Beaver was
39:48 not the way every household was in
39:49 America right plenty of dysfunctional
39:52 homes and so on and so forth what that
39:54 was was sort of a beacon to say it could
39:56 be this good if you watch this show and
39:58 start to manage your situations like
40:01 this
40:02 Tisha's sort of sitcom right I find that
40:05 films are where it started to get a lot
40:08 more gritty and a lot more close to the
40:12 reality of each one of the decades and
40:14 there's two hemispheres to this and it's
40:16 a very comical to go back and look and
40:20 I'll give you probably I'll give you the
40:23 three hemispheres that I recognize that
40:25 I think all of us do this without
40:28 discussing it with each other which is
40:30 you have Hollywood silver screen films
40:33 which came first you know first silent
40:36 then talkies now talkies was where I got
40:39 serious because silent you couldn't
40:40 quite carry reality the way that it was
40:42 everything was over acted and you know
40:45 the makeup was outrageous to to read on
40:47 these black-and-white cameras by the
40:49 time you got to the 30s you got movies
40:51 like Casablanca 1936 Humphrey Bogart
40:55 Ingrid Oh Ingrid Bergman amazing
41:00 masterpieces of film and I and again my
41:02 teaching at Robert McKee screenwriting
41:04 teacher Robert McKee he'd to sex this in
41:06 his first introductory class for an
41:08 entire day and it is utterly shocking
41:12 and overwhelming as a storyteller you
41:16 could be a layman walking in this show
41:19 with no background in Hollywood and your
41:20 job will be on the ground by the time
41:22 he's done dissecting a movie that was
41:23 made you know 80 plus years ago the
41:28 mastery that these people had the
41:29 bastard that the directors and the set
41:31 designers had is actually even more
41:33 insanely brilliant than the brilliant
41:36 actors that carried the characters as I
41:39 said in the screenwriting episodes the
41:43 interesting thing to know about the
41:44 American society in 1930s was that today
41:47 if you were to be hired to do a script
41:50 you in a full script a full script
41:52 treatment which doesn't really happen
41:54 anymore but you read 120 pages because
41:56 each page is to equal a minute that's
41:58 how quickly we consume a page when we
42:02 read and when we when we actually read
42:04 it out loud you know translate action
42:06 and paragraphs into actions on the
42:09 camera right but Casablanca I believe is
42:12 about a hundred and seventy six pages
42:14 long the script
42:15 but it was acted in under a hundred
42:18 minutes why is that significant it's
42:22 significant because we used to talk
42:26 faster we used to think faster and no
42:32 one had any problem keeping up with the
42:33 dialog this wasn't some stylistic thing
42:37 that it was like oh my gosh have you
42:38 gone to the movies today they talk super
42:40 fast oh really let's go do it okay and
42:42 we're all learning how to talk fast no
42:45 wasn't some weird pig latin version of
42:47 english it was normal English but now
42:50 what happened to Americans right after
42:53 the the 30s well they start
42:55 experimenting with fluoridating water in
42:57 the mid 40s became standard and I can
43:01 what 1954 and all that went down the
43:04 tubes write everything down and now it's
43:07 120 pages for 120 minutes that's just an
43:12 average man but the interesting subtext
43:16 of everything made back in that era is
43:17 the loving nature of man and sort of
43:22 what was capable of being sold if you go
43:25 watch gone with the wind which is a you
43:28 know a 19th century story in the 20th
43:30 century you it is the number one
43:34 grossing film per capita in the world
43:36 now we'll say it's been released over 40
43:39 times globally so they keep re releasing
43:41 the film and keep putting more money in
43:42 that bank account for that particular
43:44 film but it earned that place in history
43:49 before the 21st century ever got here
43:52 and Star Wars and Titanic and Avatar
43:55 have not been able to displace the
43:57 per-capita inflationary adjustment for
44:01 the amount of money that film is made
44:02 why do I say that because people
44:05 ingested that film because they felt
44:07 like it connected with their soul it
44:10 connected with the reality that they
44:12 were living so that could tell us
44:13 something about you know what was it
44:17 about that film that connected saying
44:20 the word dam made the word famous
44:24 frankly my dear I don't give a damn
44:27 oh boy it was a moral code that was
44:31 shattered by saying that on film and
44:33 then daring to circulate that film to
44:36 the public
44:38 interesting interesting
44:40 one it happens every day today other you
44:43 know but today it's like how can you saw
44:46 a person's body into little pieces on
44:48 camera to outdo the previous saw film
44:50 that already did that right that's where
44:53 we are today we're so winning great we
44:56 make fun of old gangster movies back in
44:58 the day because when somebody were to
45:01 fight it was more realistic like today
45:03 today's fighting when someone got shot
45:05 they just oh grab her side didn't you
45:08 know fall down there's no blood if there
45:09 was like a little tiny bit of Hershey's
45:11 chocolate that was put on their mouth
45:14 then Alfred Hitchcock comes by and blows
45:16 the doors off when a woman is
45:18 assassinated in her shower with a knife
45:21 again all Hershey syrup going down that
45:24 drain when you look back on old movies
45:27 from old eras and everyone seems goofy
45:31 and if you're at least 45 or older and
45:34 you had a fairly decent relationship
45:36 with your grandparents I was fortunate
45:38 again one of my grandparents was 10
45:39 years older than my other grandparents
45:41 so I had this interesting sort of
45:43 difference between the two my parents
45:46 grandparents are born 1910 and 1912 they
45:50 were depression kids and that they both
45:54 my parents both our grandparents grow
45:56 through the depression but one of them
45:57 grew up through the depression and their
45:59 teens and the other one grew up in the
46:01 depression in their 20s for the ones
46:04 that were trying to survive in the 20s
46:06 and raise at least one of my uncle's
46:09 during that era its guard them on a
46:13 level that never went away as I've said
46:17 several times we had the decibel problem
46:21 in America where we'd over well the
46:25 theory is that we over harvested our
46:28 lands sucked all the nutrients out
46:30 hadn't figured out how to rotate
46:31 different crops in to replenish the
46:34 nutrients and you know like if you take
46:36 cotton over and over and over again the
46:37 land the the soils dead
46:40 so they wrote eight different things I
46:41 forgot what they put in there maybe like
46:43 a subway beam or something on top of
46:45 that but they rotate the crops to keep
46:48 the soil good but when the soil can't
46:50 grow anything that becomes a dirt field
46:53 and when you have the normal wind storms
46:55 that come through the Midwest it's
46:57 creating those desert storms that you
46:59 see in the Middle East where you've got
47:02 a huge insane storm of nothing more than
47:05 wind and sand and dirt now a lot of you
47:09 are going to start seeing the 1929 crash
47:11 and everything I've talked about in
47:13 terms of the horrendous cause of these
47:15 situations but I just want to really
47:17 focus on even though folks had gone
47:20 through the Depression when you see
47:23 those old World War two movies you will
47:26 see a bunch of goofy guys doing sweet
47:29 things to each other and there is a
47:31 rapport between a male and a female
47:34 there's the things that they would never
47:36 do on a first date in the 1940s 1930s
47:39 you know yeah we know that the rules
47:42 were broken somewhere in the United
47:44 States of America but the overall
47:45 outward arc of what was acceptable
47:48 behavior was policed right on the silver
47:50 screen you could see it and then we got
47:53 television right television introduces a
47:56 whole new scenario where most of the
47:58 sitcoms were you know what is it George
48:00 and Gracie George Burns forgot Gracie's
48:04 last name excuse me but you have the
48:09 honeymooners and you have a cynicism
48:11 there and a wittiness there and you have
48:13 some grit that comes in and out and then
48:16 you have a sub culture a sub microcosm
48:19 of cultural input which are commercials
48:22 on TV now if you want to get really
48:25 granular you go down to the commercials
48:27 or are the ads inside newspapers you
48:31 look back in the 19th century and you
48:34 see a lot of snake oil being sold
48:35 literally in newspapers right all kinds
48:39 of tonics that we're always going to
48:40 cure something all these inventions that
48:43 you could you know massage your head
48:45 with women work these advanced corsets
48:48 there were machines that shook your
48:49 belly for a hundred years to say just
48:52 shaking your belly
48:53 we'll shake free they fat inside your
48:56 fat cells and you'll get thinner I
48:58 remember these things as a kid in
49:00 various basements various houses of my
49:04 family members when America had
49:07 cigarettes sold to them I think that
49:08 that is just one of the best things to
49:10 look at in terms of wow they were
49:14 smoking these things it you know if you
49:16 smoke cigarettes a couple packs a day
49:19 you definitely noticed health problems
49:21 in your life and you also stunk like
49:23 [ __ ] imagine going from never smoking
49:26 cigarettes in your household to everyone
49:28 smoking cigarettes in the household
49:29 you're trying to make out with your wife
49:31 or your husband trying to get in close
49:32 proximity conversations you're smoking
49:34 at the dinner table because you're
49:36 trying to eat their Cheerios and they're
49:38 sucking down sucking down dad's or mom's
49:41 cigarette smoke that [ __ ] sticky
49:45 horrible cigarette smoke they were
49:48 gullible because they were good one of
49:52 the most entertaining films I was raised
49:55 with or factors to I'll give you two the
49:59 first two sci-fi movies I believe The
50:01 Day the Earth Stood Still was made in
50:02 1951 I had it memorized wrong as 49 he
50:07 it is 51 anyway you watch that movie and
50:11 you have this sort of this really dapper
50:14 alien guy looks like a human being who
50:17 shows up and you have a household where
50:20 he kind of goes in where they're living
50:21 in this sort of this brownstone in
50:24 Washington DC he rents a room and
50:27 there's all kinds of rules about how you
50:30 behave and one of the women who had this
50:32 little boy who starts becoming
50:36 interested in the alien guy his mom's
50:39 going out on a date and it's very formal
50:41 and they all everyone dresses up to look
50:43 really nice and they're gonna be backed
50:44 by a certain time and could you watch
50:46 him and I'll trust you with my kid and
50:48 that that uh and there was no concern
50:53 about the crazy you know Podesta
50:55 brothers that would molest your child
50:56 today it just didn't happen right then
51:00 you have the second film that is sort of
51:02 out of this world literally which is
51:03 Forbidden Planet I believe is 1956 this
51:06 is the
51:07 the movie that Gene Roddenberry based
51:10 Star Trek on when you look at the antics
51:14 that are in this film as the comedic
51:17 pieces you start to realize how utterly
51:19 innocent we were as a society at least
51:23 in America in the 50s you know Leslie
51:26 Nielsen any of you like naked gun shows
51:28 does Lee Nielson plays a normal
51:30 theatrical role in this movie with some
51:33 comedy in there but it's it's very light
51:36 there's a scene where the chef who
51:39 actually is an actor it was in the first
51:41 Twilight Zone ever made he is trying to
51:46 smuggle somewheres in his back pocket
51:49 he's got his kitchen gear in his back
51:50 pocket and they they run a little gag on
51:52 I'm where they're using this this truck
51:54 with a big magnet on it to move a bunch
51:56 of stuff out of the ship and they're
51:57 setting up shop on this new planet and
51:59 Leslie Nielsen you know does a little
52:01 signal like nail him and the guy tries
52:04 to walk off and they turn on the magnet
52:06 and then he gets pulled up to the magnet
52:08 he's hanging from his butt and it's like
52:09 oh my god let me down you know
52:11 everyone's laughing it's like an old
52:14 sailor movie you know they're stuck on a
52:16 ship or stuck in a submarine or
52:18 something there was an innocence about
52:20 us because we hadn't completely
52:22 corrupted our brains and this is the
52:26 part that kind of sucks today is because
52:28 we are so hard today and this is a lot
52:31 of stuff I had talked about with you
52:33 know life before 9/11 episode there's a
52:37 little scene of capturing lightning in a
52:39 bottle
52:39 and you can't write you can't do that
52:43 it's a verbal phenomenon that happens
52:46 and you can't put it in a bottle there's
52:50 the old saying you know No Country for
52:52 Old Men talked about this phenomenon and
52:56 that really gets to sort of the
52:59 byproduct of looking back and being
53:00 cynical that your time that you grew up
53:03 in is no longer around anymore it's
53:05 going to go away and then you look at
53:08 how the youth of today especially Gen X
53:10 where were the remake era of of history
53:16 and and there's two sides to it I want
53:18 to open your mind to in case this isn't
53:20 complete
53:20 into you the folks that are remaking
53:24 these films destroying Star Wars
53:28 destroying Star Trek I mean utterly
53:31 destroying these franchises with
53:33 horrible scripts
53:34 that's Gen X because they don't have a
53:39 bone of creativity in them and like it's
53:43 been expressed in several different
53:44 shows on TV and movies this entitlement
53:48 that you want everything and you want it
53:49 now you don't want to have to work hard
53:51 for it you just want it right now
53:55 bettan work now gen z appears to be sort
54:00 of subconsciously getting it's like that
54:02 theory i introduced in one of the
54:04 episodes back where i said maybe
54:05 old souls come and go like cyclical
54:09 trains so for a little while we have to
54:11 harvest the the brand-new souls that are
54:13 just lost right there the remake souls
54:17 and then you do get this new train that
54:20 comes and it's like okay if you stick a
54:22 century and you divide it into three
54:24 sectors three quarters you get two
54:28 quarters of old one quarter of new
54:30 because they do anything else you can't
54:32 handle 50/50 that's too much that's too
54:34 many ignorant self entitled souls now
54:38 obviously if you follow politics and
54:40 snowflakes you we do have a fairly
54:43 publicized group that are very small
54:45 that are sort of concerning a lot of us
54:51 that have succeeded in life because we
54:52 look at them we go my god the amount of
54:55 engine tree engineering of your soul in
54:56 your mind that needs to occur is so vast
55:01 and so great they may not be able to
55:04 pull it off in their lifetime which is
55:07 why i think suicide rates are fairly
55:08 high today Elvis Presley Elvis Presley
55:13 hits the airwaves shakes his hips too
55:16 much on the Ed Sullivan Show they found
55:19 them from the waist up but that sort of
55:21 let the cat out of the bag didn't it of
55:24 course we had Little Richard be a Chuck
55:30 Berry the predecessors to Elvis
55:33 Little Richard is now finally getting
55:35 his credit to having really invented
55:38 what we know as rock and roll and I'm
55:41 very very happy that that is now
55:43 starting to come about I think it was a
55:46 wasn't it Michael Jackson bought his
55:49 entire catalogue and gave it back to him
55:52 fantastic whoever did that I think it's
55:55 Michael for my exploration of American
56:00 history 30s 40s and 50s
56:03 were very very similar in terms of
56:07 hanging on to that moral base and
56:09 hanging on to hey it's not like we
56:12 haven't been to World War One World War
56:14 two there's still some dudes like my
56:16 great-grandfather who lived a hundred
56:18 and one he made it to the 30s and was in
56:20 the Civil War twice it's like these guys
56:23 didn't know what the Shi T looked like
56:26 right but they chose not to bring that
56:30 stuff home to the best of their ability
56:32 there's always an exception to the rule
56:34 so I'm a little 1% that has horrible
56:36 PTSD slash shell-shocked and they have
56:39 to deal with that
56:39 there's just bad circumstances sometimes
56:42 right but the overwhelming majority of
56:45 the American population was hanging on
56:47 to the American idea which is now
56:49 referenced as the American dream with
56:52 the American dream / the American idea
56:54 is not just one thing that is churning
56:59 day-to-day to keep it going
57:01 it is a multi-dimensional set of
57:04 principles set of you know outward
57:08 principles towards the country inner
57:10 principles towards yourself and your
57:11 family how we court each other is huge I
57:17 got an episode on chivalry did extremely
57:18 well with a lot of the listeners
57:21 especially the female listeners they
57:22 really appreciated it I got a lot of
57:24 personal comments about that because the
57:28 ladies are ready the ladies are ready to
57:32 bring back chivalry and I think that if
57:36 the guys really think it through
57:38 they'll want it too because it used to
57:41 be a lot more honorable and beautiful
57:43 and
57:44 simple you got more for your bang and
57:49 fathers and mothers felt much more
57:51 comfortable back in the courtship days
57:53 with who their sons and daughters ended
57:56 up marrying because there was a process
57:59 sons and daughters stayed more connected
58:02 to their parents back in those days you
58:04 know you didn't like today in America my
58:06 god if your kid hits 16 they're sort of
58:09 starting to disappear from your
58:10 consciousness after college they
58:13 disappear for a few years until they
58:15 realize around 25 that you do know some
58:20 things that they need to know they start
58:22 seeing you in the mirror yeah maybe I
58:24 should go back to figure out where I
58:25 came from so I can figure out where I'm
58:26 going right in the 60s everything
58:29 changed everything blew apart you had
58:34 probably a good 30 to 40 percent of the
58:37 population of America experimenting with
58:39 all kinds of drugs taking the shackles
58:43 off of the morality of sex and finding
58:47 out that you know because I have some
58:49 friends of mine that lived through this
58:50 era in a very deep deep way they went to
58:54 the communes they took the drugs they
58:56 toured with a dead they worked for the
58:59 dead and what they sort of distilled
59:03 down to me was that when they did open
59:06 up the physical and it was never as
59:08 intense as I've never had anyone tell me
59:10 it was as intense as the movies make it
59:12 out to be where there's people having
59:14 sex with everybody all the time and
59:15 these communes I asked my friends about
59:17 that and they said well you know it was
59:19 a lot more free-flowing that is today
59:23 but it wasn't much wasn't much more
59:25 intense yesterday but the big thing was
59:29 that well you know they couldn't see an
59:31 immediate damage to themselves by
59:32 experimenting but they still did have
59:34 the kind of moral base from their
59:36 upbringing and if you really want to
59:38 parse it first one second you have to
59:40 think about it like this the kids that
59:42 were really experimenting in the 60s
59:44 we're the ones that could leave their
59:45 house at 18 years old and go to college
59:47 so you're not talking about 12 year olds
59:50 experiencing the 60s like the 20 year
59:53 olds in the 60s there's two different
59:55 populations going on here
59:56 you know Prince was born in 1958 so was
59:59 Michael Jackson so both of them entered
60:01 the 60s as children they weren't running
60:04 around you know painted in fluorescent
60:08 paint taken acid in some commune right
60:11 and that probably protected them caught
60:14 a bit so we got these amazing things out
60:15 of them you know we did have the blight
60:18 on society which was the Vietnam War
60:20 going on the United States of America
60:21 and that really set everybody on edge
60:26 what the kids saw made a lot of the
60:31 worst situations of World War one pale
60:33 in comparison because in World War one
60:35 you had a definitive enemy that you
60:38 could find in Vietnam you had a farmer
60:40 during the day and a vehicon warrior
60:43 during the night shouldn't have been
60:45 there right pointless war just to make
60:47 us take money out to the European cartel
60:51 it was part of the exchange the LBJ gave
60:55 the bankers for killing his running mate
60:57 in the 60s we had assassinations as a
61:00 means of as a means to an end for the
61:03 shadow government that is now the deep
61:05 state that has been completely exposed
61:08 JFK's murdered MLK's murdered
61:12 RFK is murdered Malcolm X's murder
61:17 I miss quoted the exact technicality
61:22 Mixon was running for president and had
61:25 the opponent shot after a stomp at a
61:31 particular state I forget the
61:33 gentleman's name because he's kind of
61:34 obscure in history but he was shot in
61:35 the gut like Larry Flynt and he became
61:37 paralyzed from the waist down and he
61:39 dropped out of the race that's how Nixon
61:41 I believe was re-elected so nasty stuff
61:46 was going on now because we weren't
61:49 really totally conscious to all this
61:52 stuff you know
61:52 Hunter S Thompson was conscious to this
61:54 kind of stuff and a bunch of sort of
61:56 beatnik brilliant intellectuals of the
62:00 time we're aware of what these
62:02 assassinations meant and who was
62:04 probably doing them you know John Lennon
62:07 eventually became very aware of what the
62:09 CIA was doing and he was putting his
62:14 life on the line going after them in
62:15 every interview and eventually they
62:17 arranged for him to be shot just outside
62:19 of the building he was living in again
62:23 how Yoko Ono continued living that
62:25 building blows me away
62:25 when I went to New York for the first
62:27 time someone said okay we're gonna go
62:29 where John Lennon was murdered I was
62:31 like okay and they pointed this stair
62:33 step exit back exit and then they go
62:36 yeah and you know Yoko owns his building
62:38 and she lives on the top floor I don't
62:40 like really you want to get outside your
62:43 house every single day and see where
62:45 your husband was murdered it blows me
62:47 away
62:47 heavy Constitution that woman but in the
62:50 Midwest there was something very
62:51 interesting going on because the Midwest
62:54 doesn't have this close proximity sort
62:58 of feeling of engagement with all of the
63:00 shenanigans that went on in the 60s they
63:04 don't feel super close to coastal
63:06 regions so it's agriculture in the
63:09 Midwest is sort of like meat and
63:11 potatoes kind of world you got the
63:12 railroad that keeps most the towns full
63:15 of business you know you have a major
63:17 highway that goes through your town with
63:19 all the truckers and all the people
63:20 traveling by it your little shops and
63:22 it's all going well education well it's
63:25 sort of a reading writing and arithmetic
63:27 world and so you had great engineers
63:30 coming out of that art was a mandatory
63:33 subject matter both in the arts of
63:37 rendering so painting drawing that kind
63:40 of thing all the way up to playing an
63:42 instrument so that really gave the mind
63:45 a three-dimensional exercise and opening
63:47 up left brain and right brain
63:49 obviously the 70s as I always talked
63:52 about on the show between 75 and 85 the
63:56 beautiful the kids that were born in the
63:58 40s and 50s created all these amazing
64:01 films between 75 and 85
64:03 cream-of-the-crop kids and I would say
64:06 good 40% of them had dropped you know
64:09 probably 50 to 100 trips on acid opening
64:13 their mind to what could visually happen
64:15 but some didn't you know I don't think
64:18 George Lucas was a big druggie I don't
64:21 think that Steven Spielberg was a big
64:23 druggy but the people that they hired to
64:27 make of their films did I can I know a
64:30 lot of them they absolutely did so it's
64:32 not a mandatory thing to be an amazing
64:34 film contributor but it definitely
64:36 didn't hurt the system again we didn't
64:38 have cocaine in the world at that point
64:40 in the mid-70s obviously explodes starts
64:45 to dominate the 80s and the former crack
64:47 cocaine I'm gonna tell you guys a an
64:50 interesting crack cocaine story I knew
64:54 you guys like what
64:55 but the is a band out there that is
65:00 amazing
65:01 names Steel Panther and the lead singer
65:05 I believe his name is Ralph sands as
65:07 saying Z and he is very forthcoming
65:11 about this information and it's sort of
65:13 a rags to riches story so I think it has
65:16 value for everyone to hear this kind of
65:18 thing but this sort of I think it opens
65:22 up the non urban citizens of the world
65:26 to understand how prolific and
65:28 destructive crack cocaine can be to your
65:30 life right it's not a huge problem right
65:32 now in in a lot of the role I've talked
65:34 to cops in LA who have retired
65:37 thirty-year cops and LA have been all
65:39 around during the 80s and 90s and first
65:41 obviously ten years of this century and
65:45 they say crack use down is down drug use
65:47 is down considerably and there always be
65:50 a little surge of this and we'll surger
65:52 that but they said it's much safer in
65:53 Los Angeles than it's ever been but I
65:57 the very first day I met the band Steel
66:02 Panther I was with my buddy Bobby
66:04 blotter and he's a drummer for rat and
66:06 he he called me one night was really
66:09 kind of funny it was a Monday night and
66:10 I had stayed up all night from Sunday to
66:14 Monday and he calls me up and he's like
66:16 what are you doing man I said I was just
66:18 about to say I'm about to go to sleep
66:19 and he was come daily I said why because
66:22 I'm gonna play with Steel Panther
66:23 tonight Emily who is still Panther and
66:25 he goes at the time they didn't create
66:26 their own music no they got three albums
66:27 of their own stuff and it's brilliant
66:29 and it's satire and it's it's hilarious
66:32 it's one of the most talented metal
66:34 bands
66:34 to ever exist let alone be playing music
66:37 and making music to this day so he tells
66:40 me it's like it's at the time they were
66:41 singing you know all the traditional 80
66:43 songs and they do funny stuff in between
66:45 the songs and and he tells me about this
66:48 and it just sounded awful I go online
66:50 I'm looking at videos and of course the
66:52 videos don't capture the audio very well
66:54 and I'm like hmm and I just thought you
66:56 just had this feeling you know when you
66:58 get that feeling of like you just need
66:59 to do this this is going to be a good
67:00 moment and so we were going to the Key
67:04 Club which has now been destroyed by
67:06 jay-z
67:06 the self righteous ignorant cheater who
67:09 tries to tell you how the world should
67:10 be the Key Club was awesome back in the
67:13 day on Sunset Boulevard and they go
67:14 there and I park my car and rendezvous
67:16 with Bob out front we pushed all the way
67:20 to the back to the green room and there
67:22 Steel Panther getting ready putting the
67:24 other gear on right two of the guys have
67:26 really long hair and two of them don't
67:28 so they were prosthetic you know kind of
67:30 wig hair with headbands to hide all the
67:31 stuff and I hadn't seen him play yet and
67:35 so I'm meeting them and I say hi you
67:39 know we're having a conversation and
67:41 then I would go out to the to the sit
67:45 down and the way that Steel Panther used
67:46 to do it back in the day and they still
67:47 probably do it to the stage they will
67:49 hide celebrities from the 80's rock
67:51 bands in the audience and then they pull
67:54 them on stage as a surprise and then
67:56 they'll usually collaborate and you know
67:58 so I'm like Tommy Lee's daughter played
68:01 or I think tiny daughter sister thing
68:03 cuz his daughter played once that night
68:06 he was gonna be pink singing and Bobby
68:08 playing the drums on the little cameo
68:09 they're gonna do sweet child of mine so
68:12 we're watching so sorry we go out to
68:14 this little suite in the front there so
68:17 then they they opened the concert by
68:19 playing Van Halen's Panama and my brain
68:22 is just popping because it sounds
68:24 identical they play a small backup track
68:27 but Ralph can sing just like David Lee
68:31 Roth I mean everything the super high
68:33 squealy stuff and it's just tremendous
68:36 they do all kinds of songs from the 80s
68:37 and it might you know and Satchel the
68:39 guitar player his real name escapes me
68:41 at the moment he's one of the best
68:43 guitar players in the world I'm watching
68:45 this and my mind's blown Bob gets pulled
68:47 up pink
68:48 I met backstage is going up there and
68:50 singing and so I'm just like oh my god
68:51 this is amazing
68:52 TMZ filmed it and so then it's over Bob
68:58 leaves and so now I am going to go back
69:01 and meet these guys again cuz now I got
69:03 to tell him how amazing they are course
69:05 they already know and they don't really
69:07 need me to say anything and so one of
69:08 the guys that was there I mean a ton of
69:10 folks there was Jamie Lane was there
69:12 from warrant the Nickelback lead singer
69:14 was there and so I'm falling a
69:17 Nickleback guy and we're going back
69:19 there and immediately satchel comes out
69:22 and he stops him and he says I'm just
69:25 watching the Nickelback guy go through
69:26 this and crazy experience so he's
69:28 already had his entire career he is done
69:30 the grunge era is over but I have this
69:33 massively talented lead singer in front
69:35 of me he stops at you and he goes you
69:37 are one of the best guitar players I've
69:39 ever seen in my life
69:40 and such as like cool man he just walks
69:42 off because he's just that kind of guy
69:45 we get back in there and we bump into
69:48 Ralph's lead singer I probably should be
69:51 calling him by his stage name but I
69:52 can't remember the [ __ ] it is but anyway
69:54 so I have this moment where I got Ralph
69:58 on the right and the Nickelback on my
70:00 left I understand in the center and no
70:02 one's bothering us there's a bunch of
70:03 people in the road but no one's
70:04 bothering us and he comes to the Ralph's
70:06 and he goes he goes dude he goes first
70:10 question he goes do you really do David
70:12 Lee Roth like do you do the screen the
70:14 squelching thing that he does and
70:16 Ralph's like very humble do the whole
70:18 band is mega humble and Ralph goes yeah
70:21 yeah I do it he goes because like we
70:23 have a backup track but you can't hear
70:24 it you know and he goes do it do it
70:28 right now and I was like man I just got
70:31 off my day job you know and he's like
70:33 and do it and so Ralph goes wolf and
70:36 sends out this huge squeal just like
70:39 David Lee Roth right in front of me and
70:40 I'm just like god damn some amazing and
70:43 so the next question comes out of the
70:45 Nickelback guy and he goes he goes you
70:49 and I are about the same age she goes
70:50 money be a little older than me he goes
70:51 how do you how why weren't you a huge
70:55 hit in the 80s I mean your talent is
70:57 crazy a good-looking guy what's going on
70:59 how did you not get discovered
71:02 and Ralph was very forthright humble and
71:05 he just crack cocaine and the Nickelback
71:09 guy laughs thinking he's telling a joke
71:11 because the band tells jokes constantly
71:13 right and I was sitting there and I
71:15 don't know anything about this backstory
71:16 and so I noticed that Ralph sent not
71:18 laughing and the new Quebec guy goes are
71:21 you kidding me are you serious he goes
71:24 yep I think goes well what's your story
71:27 man and he said well I think I got the
71:30 numbers right he said I took my first
71:31 hit of crack cocaine at 23 years old and
71:33 he goes I don't remember much of my life
71:36 until I was in my late 30s and I met the
71:38 woman who's now my wife it's a total job
71:41 story with this guy and he goes you're
71:44 kidding me he says no and he goes she
71:47 pulled me out of this stuff we formed
71:49 this band and which I don't know how
71:51 they met the met each other I should
71:53 probably look that up but now that you
71:56 know when I met him everyone was doing
71:58 very well financially they all bought
72:00 their homes they were doing this tour
72:01 between Los Angeles Vegas and San Diego
72:04 going in this little triangle and just
72:06 cleaning up but they were working on
72:08 their first album at the time and so
72:12 hearing Ralph tell a story was a little
72:15 shocking and it took a few years for me
72:17 to completely contemplate what the hell
72:19 was happening because as a I guess a
72:23 Caucasian guy here in America we don't
72:26 have I don't personally have any friends
72:28 that got you know hooked up on crack
72:29 cocaine I didn't have any friends that
72:31 have friends that have told me the story
72:32 about this kind of thing and now I'm
72:34 looking at this really handsome dude
72:35 who's I believe at the time he's about
72:37 43 and I'm I'm thinking yeah this guy is
72:43 actually better-looking than David Lee
72:45 Roth and why wouldn't he have been
72:50 successful and that was the reason and
72:51 so it really got to the point where when
72:55 we allow these modifications to society
72:57 you know it out early destroyed the
73:00 ghettos right it destroyed the ghettos
73:02 everyone that couldn't sell drugs was
73:04 taking them in a lot of cases and then
73:06 you have of course these families like
73:08 you know dr. Dre's family that's keeping
73:10 clean ice-cubes families keeping clean
73:11 and they're breeding these amazing kids
73:14 out of the ghetto
73:15 so you do have these stars these you
73:18 know diamonds that come out of those
73:19 horrible situations but have we not lost
73:23 okay
73:24 the standards of old America Ralph would
73:29 have been discovered in his 20s right
73:33 now obviously with every tragedy like
73:35 I've said several times NWA main have
73:37 never happened at least the way that it
73:39 did it wouldn't have been hey we're
73:41 getting roughed up by the police and you
73:44 know we're we're being forced to become
73:47 a band to make money because selling
73:49 drugs for eazy-e
73:51 wasn't going to continue who's gonna die
73:52 selling drugs like I said in other
73:54 episodes right what's interesting about
73:57 what's going on right now is that we
73:58 have the idea that has a lot of
74:03 globalists dust on it which is obviously
74:06 freedom but it it really goes back to
74:09 the heart of how we live what we need to
74:12 be happy has been lost it has been
74:16 veneered and coated and painted over and
74:19 over and over with these sort of sort of
74:22 fairy tales of what makes us happy which
74:25 is money and possessions anything that
74:29 matters today almost doesn't really
74:33 matter today right never mattered 6070
74:36 years ago right we have a presidential
74:41 movement in America that is starting to
74:43 have infect other European countries as
74:45 our president travels around Europe
74:48 there other countries that are going
74:49 yeah we remember this too where you
74:51 remember when boom and bust cycles were
74:55 75 years apart from each other not six
74:58 to eight years apart from each other and
75:00 now the youth of today is rebelling and
75:03 a lot of nonsensical ways because they
75:06 have no idea what to do and of course
75:09 those of us that are more centered from
75:11 these older errors are looking at these
75:12 snowflakes in complete disgust at a 1-1
75:16 level you can blame them another level
75:19 you kind of have to go well yeah I get
75:21 why you're that way I do and if you had
75:24 grown up in my era
75:25 you wouldn't be snowflakes you wouldn't
75:28 be
75:29 week trying to trying to dumb society
75:33 down to take care of your meekness
75:35 there's an old saying from the Bible
75:38 right that says the meek shall inherit
75:39 the earth
75:40 and what's really fascinating about that
75:45 is that's really sort of a massive
75:47 insult to those that feel like they are
75:51 part of that group
75:52 I used to say 20 years ago yeah yeah you
75:55 go ahead and inherit the earth I'm gonna
75:57 I'm gonna go to heaven right you take
76:00 care of this I'm gonna go where there's
76:01 no limitations and you're willing to
76:04 accept that because you're meek they're
76:08 not willing to have the full infinite
76:09 spectrum of what your soul is capable of
76:11 doing because you're meek we don't have
76:14 in this day and age a few things anymore
76:18 and hopefully it's coming back okay
76:20 there's a lot of there's a lot of actual
76:22 signs that is coming back so I shouldn't
76:24 I'm not trying to be cynical but we
76:26 should teach our children not to be meek
76:29 the lessons that we choose to teach our
76:31 kids should be geared at making sure
76:33 they're not meek and how do you do that
76:35 you you essentially you hear these
76:36 phrases like nut up it's for females and
76:40 males right stop being weak stop
76:44 complaining
76:45 life is hard tough [ __ ] that's the way
76:49 it's been for everyone all the time
76:51 throughout time because regardless of
76:53 what the standard of life is it's been
76:55 tough but it did in terms of employment
76:59 and retirement it was a lot better 50 60
77:03 years ago because we had standards that
77:06 we were desperately trying to hang on to
77:08 but as soon as the globalists got in
77:11 there and started messing with our
77:12 educational systems marketing
77:14 departments really put you know went
77:16 full bore on telling you that what you
77:18 had wasn't making you happy you had to
77:20 get this new thing which has been going
77:21 on for hundreds of years it greased up
77:25 your palms to the point you couldn't
77:26 hang on to anything that was actually
77:30 good for you it was pried out of your
77:32 mental capacity to hang on when you go
77:35 to the Midwest one of the things that
77:37 you will see are if you go to it was a
77:40 lot of the towns in the Midwest
77:42 you will see these old homes that were
77:44 built after World War two sort of during
77:46 that baby boomer era and even some built
77:48 before that but they'll be these little
77:51 tiny homes that are about 900 square
77:52 feet and you will ask and variably some
77:57 questions about Hughes to live in those
77:58 homes and they will tell you that there
78:00 were families of four or more in those
78:03 homes and you're leaking housing
78:04 impossible right 900 square feet that's
78:07 what's a two-bedroom yeah it was now not
78:13 trying to get us back into sardine cans
78:14 but there was a time in least in America
78:18 in the Midwest when people were content
78:19 with the bare minimum the chances are we
78:25 won't go back to the bare minimum unless
78:27 we let the globalists win right the
78:30 other one is really related to my
78:31 episode on the American Way which is
78:34 this letting corporations you know
78:40 factor in obsolescence and everything
78:43 I'm gonna put this in here because
78:46 there's no other good place to put it in
78:47 here I've made this sort of rant about
78:50 Apple Computer three times and I've
78:53 never released it because it just gets
78:56 to the point where it's it's way too
78:58 meandering and the factors change so
79:00 much day to day that you just wouldn't
79:03 have value after six months but you've
79:06 been lied to for a very very long time
79:08 about the obsolescence and all of your
79:11 devices and this goes over to at least
79:13 the Android platform
79:14 not so much Windows it's very
79:16 interesting but Apple came out and said
79:18 that they are deliberately slowing down
79:19 your mobile devices meaning your iPads
79:22 and you're essentially anything runs on
79:26 batteries okay by saying that if they if
79:29 they don't slow down your battery then
79:31 your battery life is going to go down
79:34 and so they slowed down the processor
79:35 cycles to supposedly not make your
79:37 battery explode or whatever it is right
79:38 used to have a I had the first titanium
79:41 laptop Apple made and the battery got to
79:44 be about two inches thick
79:45 when it was initially about half an inch
79:47 thick but it's a lie how you know it's a
79:51 lie because my iMac
79:55 doesn't run on batteries and my iMac and
79:58 my old desktop power mat are Mac Pro's
80:03 don't have batteries in them I may have
80:06 little clock batteries but they don't
80:07 have a supply battery but every time
80:10 they security patch or give you a new
80:12 operating system what happens a computer
80:14 loses about 20% of its performance Apple
80:19 Computer needs to be utterly gutted with
80:23 a class-action lawsuit of massive
80:25 proportions to the extent that if you've
80:28 ever bought an Apple product ever in
80:30 your life okay say past at least the
80:34 year 2000 and you experience this
80:36 ceremonious degradation of the speed of
80:40 your device and androids again do it too
80:42 then you should get the full purchase
80:45 price credit at least if not full
80:47 hardcore cash back for that device
80:51 there's some prorated thing where it's
80:53 like you know after the first year they
80:56 start patching you down but all Apple
80:58 has to do is recompile all the operating
81:00 systems for the native processor that's
81:02 in your phone and stopped this BS and
81:05 then you would find that your computer
81:08 that's 10 years old
81:09 all of a sudden is a rocket you probably
81:13 can't go back 20 years your processor
81:14 has limitations but the operating
81:16 systems do have sort of composite layers
81:18 that they created but that stuff's not
81:19 been Girton not been greatly enhanced
81:21 for ten years all they try to do now is
81:24 infect your operating system with social
81:27 media because that's the spying
81:28 mechanism that's why OS 10 if it has 100
81:32 new features 99 of them are all social
81:34 media notifications and social media
81:36 spying on your computer this
81:39 obsolescence is the other thing that we
81:42 as a society have to get rid of out of
81:45 our thought process and Europe you got
81:47 to do it too
81:49 other than amenities that you were used
81:51 to today that don't that didn't exist
81:53 say in the 30s 40s 50s you would not
81:57 regret I'm willing to bet going back to
82:00 the era where my grandparents grew up
82:02 but they didn't worry about having
82:04 enough money save the depression of the
82:07 30s right
82:08 having worries about putting food on the
82:11 table a shelter over your head some form
82:13 of retirement savings all my
82:16 grandparents got to their retirement
82:20 years with hundreds of thousands of
82:24 dollars in the bank account and they did
82:26 not I have one relative that that did
82:28 have quite a bit of money because their
82:30 father worked really really hard and
82:31 managed to buy a lot of land at the
82:33 right time and and farmed it and got oil
82:36 out of it so I do have one side of
82:38 family that never ever worried but the
82:40 other side was totally normal totally
82:42 normal like anybody else made you know
82:45 average wages here and there but just
82:46 save to save save and why were they able
82:49 to save because they didn't get caught
82:51 up in this micro transaction world that
82:53 we live in today you gotta have the new
82:55 thing kind of the new thing I have a new
82:56 thing I got friends here in their 80s
82:58 right now they don't have to have the
83:00 new thing I go to their house it is
83:04 enchanting to be in their house it's not
83:06 it there's some I got Barcelona chairs
83:09 made in the 30s and I've got a sofa made
83:11 in the 70s and I got a TV made a year
83:13 ago so they do upgrade but they just do
83:16 it at a logical pace it's based on a
83:20 critical need not just some fad need and
83:24 I'm telling you they got it right they
83:28 got it right and again you could have
83:31 your laptop and your cell phone in a
83:33 world of say nineteen fifty five you
83:35 could the final thing that we have to
83:39 preserve is the moral base that we lost
83:42 what is acceptable what isn't acceptable
83:44 a lot of our addictions today are based
83:48 on things that we don't want to give up
83:49 but they're not good for us are they we
83:52 have to make decisions about what world
83:54 we want to live in
83:55 so the Gen Xers that can hear me they
83:57 have kids yeah you could mulch this data
84:00 your own way do your own research come
84:02 up with your own idea of what this could
84:04 be
84:04 and then maybe tell your kids maybe you
84:07 can't save your kids maybe you can only
84:10 save your grandkids and your grandkid
84:13 wants to play an instrument you buy it
84:14 for him or her let him get into it if
84:19 you're 35 and over then all this
84:22 crazy stuff that's happened to the world
84:24 has happened on your watch and the baby
84:27 boomer parents missed it in most cases
84:29 they missed it so it's up to us it's up
84:33 to us to own it and do something about
84:36 it most of it's probably just education
84:40 it's just education as an old person
84:43 what do you need really you know do you
84:46 need a tremendous amount of money in the
84:47 bank you know if you're sitting on a
84:49 million dollars and your retirement is
84:51 only going to cost you five hundred
84:53 thousand - do me a favor would you take
84:56 ten thousand dollars and spend it wisely
84:58 on one of your kids and if you don't
85:00 have any kids and you got that money do
85:03 whatever you can it's not just about
85:04 transferring money to a bank account you
85:06 want to actually convert it to something
85:07 that is tangible they don't give kids
85:09 money because they'll just spend in the
85:10 wrong way but again little instrument
85:12 here a little thing there Prince the
85:14 musician Prince spent tens of millions
85:17 of dollars they estimate in over the
85:20 course of his lifetime potentially a
85:22 hundred million dollars giving
85:24 instruments out to kids all over the
85:26 United States of America he converted
85:28 what he knew is a very rewarding pastime
85:31 creating music and he put his money
85:33 where his mouth is and secretly did it
85:35 so no one knew you know I contribute
85:38 most of time my effort so I take my
85:41 money when I painted the kids ramp
85:43 across the street it wasn't that I
85:45 wanted to give him a sexy-looking
85:47 skate ramp that was part of it because I
85:50 hated seeing this ugly-ass thing that
85:51 was there but the big thing was I i sat
85:54 out front with a notebook and a pat a
85:55 pad and pen okay watching him do his
85:57 thing
85:58 drawing up concepts then I had him come
86:00 up to me and he barely knew me at news
86:02 parents really well
86:03 his parents are outside most the time
86:05 watching I said okay you're the client I
86:06 am working for you now the kids like
86:08 what that blue is mine I said okay these
86:11 are some ideas I have for your ramp do
86:13 you like this oh yeah totally cool why
86:15 don't you do this this okay and I make
86:17 changes and worked on it for about a
86:18 month i perfected all out then I said
86:21 when can I get your ramp because I'm
86:22 gonna need it for a couple weeks and hit
86:25 some rails and some other little ramps
86:26 and so he's like okay so I pulled it
86:28 back he round this patio I drew it and I
86:30 designed it when I gave it to him and it
86:32 was not anything for me other than to
86:35 say
86:35 making a kid understand something it was
86:37 free and I had him come back and help me
86:38 put the base coat on a lot kind of he's
86:40 participating in it right and it's his
86:42 design so when he shows it off to his
86:44 friends to an extent there's a lot of
86:46 logos on there and stuff that were all
86:47 his idea
86:48 it's my artwork but who cares he got to
86:52 see the process happen you got to see
86:54 someone give him something out of thin
86:55 air and it's the way you hand down a
86:57 methodology to somebody else so if you
87:00 can do that I guarantee you will have
87:02 immense satisfaction from that process
87:05 in your life so try to find something
87:09 cool like that that you can do and take
87:10 some time figure it out you want to do
87:12 it right away but if you can do
87:13 something you know don't be the as it
87:15 was a Steve Jobs said I don't want to be
87:17 the richest guy in the cemetery
87:18 I would suggest following that to a tee
