00:28 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentlemen today we're gonna discuss
00:35 something called universal basic income
00:39 with the specialization in minimum basic
00:42 income so if you're like me you've heard
00:48 socialists online at rallies promising
00:53 everyone a universal basic income people
00:57 like Bernie Sanders especially who has
01:00 definitely lived off the dole of the
01:02 people his entire life and it always
01:07 seems to be inside these pushes for
01:09 socialism you know which can have
01:13 various forms over it
01:15 communism you know for one and when you
01:20 hear about you know this idea you go
01:24 what is that what is universal basic
01:26 income and they'll say well you know
01:27 every single month every confirmed
01:31 citizen of a particular country gets X
01:34 amount of dollars a month regardless if
01:38 they do anything and for those of us who
01:41 work our asses off for our money
01:43 it seems very counterintuitive but one
01:51 of my good friends who I'm in a little
01:55 project with he's extremely well
01:59 informed in so many aspects of society
02:06 and how things are formed he was
02:10 preaching this on a phone call to me on
02:11 a conference call before we're starting
02:13 a bigger conference call and I was
02:15 surprised there come out of his mouth I
02:17 was like what do you mean you know I've
02:20 been an entrepreneur my whole life and
02:21 earning money since I was a little kid
02:23 and I'm like what do you mean you're
02:25 gonna take away this this motivation to
02:27 work mother of invention that's what
02:29 creates all goodness and life and he
02:33 said you know he goes I thought the same
02:36 thing when I first heard this I was
02:38 like what person in the right mind would
02:40 ever go for this and then he started
02:44 getting into it and he definitely
02:46 prefaced what he was saying which I'm
02:48 gonna preface as well this doesn't work
02:51 yet it doesn't work yet there's no one
02:54 who has solved no country that has
02:56 solved for all the problems that this
02:59 system creates immediately so we don't
03:05 have this figured out just yet but I
03:10 will tell you that having made the Star
03:11 Trek episode and Gene Roddenberry's
03:14 world which is our ultimate first goal
03:16 of you know changing what we have now it
03:19 seems like it's part of the game it's
03:22 just we have a problem we've a lot a
03:26 bunch of corrupt people to gain power in
03:30 the world I'm not talking about rich
03:32 people I'm talking about corrupt people
03:34 some of them make themselves rich
03:36 through corruption there's a lot of good
03:39 extremely wealthy people in this world I
03:43 don't know if it's a majority or not so
03:46 don't don't think I'm saying what I'm
03:48 not saying but here's the very first
03:52 argument for this which hit me pretty
03:56 good I wouldn't say a ton of bricks but
03:58 at least half a ton of bricks which is
04:02 that it takes away the stigma of being
04:04 on welfare these social programs that
04:09 help you when you're down and out really
04:12 leave you with the stigma it leaves you
04:15 with a stigma to the outside world and
04:17 it leaves you with a stigma probably
04:19 more impactful to yourself if somebody
04:22 said okay let's give you take yourself
04:25 for one second because you will
04:26 empathically get this I think very
04:28 quickly and again there's different
04:31 models to this and we'll explain this in
04:33 a second but you have this overall
04:36 theory of of universal basic income and
04:40 then you have something called
04:42 guaranteed minimum income GMI and then
04:45 you have minimum basic income
04:47 MBI
04:49 we're gonna be focusing on the one that
04:52 takes care of social programs such as
04:55 welfare and unemployment now what if
04:58 every single month you made a thousand
05:00 dollars and again that's not that's
05:03 jack-shit and in this world today but a
05:05 thousand bucks sort of keeps you out of
05:07 the ditch right those dozen bucks might
05:09 get you a month at a hotel or motel it
05:16 again keep you out of the ring keep your
05:18 cold keep you on the heat each a little
05:21 bit of food you're not going to be even
05:22 great but you won't starve to death it's
05:25 12 grand a year again that's not enough
05:28 to stay in California very easily but
05:34 now everybody gets this stuff everyone
05:38 gets it so now you don't get food stamps
05:45 anymore you don't get welfare anymore
05:47 you never need to apply for unemployment
05:50 I mean you you may need more money but
05:55 you're gonna have enough money to
05:57 survive you may not be able to keep your
05:59 house and being able to keep your big
06:00 car again there's mother of invention
06:03 that's still available where you could
06:06 live in this country for $1,000 a month
06:10 you know there's lots of places in the
06:12 Midwest you could do it I don't know if
06:16 there'd be a differential for Southern
06:18 California would almost seem like you
06:21 know you start ganking the system people
06:22 start claiming addresses that they don't
06:24 live in to get the higher wages so it's
06:26 never been given a variable amount of
06:30 money so now when you think about where
06:34 you are in life you will always have
06:38 this money if you go and earn more money
06:40 then it's just more money it's more
06:42 slush fund that you can put into other
06:44 things go back and get some school buy
06:48 some things that you want save it it's
06:51 not taxable that's the other big one but
06:55 it gets rid of this thing where someone
06:57 could ask you or or somehow put it
07:01 against you that you've been on welfare
07:03 in your lifetime or you're currently on
07:05 it you wouldn't have to necessarily get
07:09 any unemployment it would usually all
07:11 these individual programs all these
07:13 assistance programs and I don't know a
07:14 bunch of them cuz I've never been on any
07:16 of them besides unemployment at times it
07:20 all goes away and the other thing that
07:23 happens which is very very interesting
07:25 and I've definitely known about this one
07:27 is that I know that there are social
07:30 programs out there where you'll get a
07:32 little bit of assistance from the state
07:34 from the government or whatever but if
07:36 you earn one penny there in the time
07:39 that you're getting this assistance they
07:41 removed all the income so see you're
07:44 making a thousand dollars a month off of
07:46 some welfare program of some sort and
07:48 you go out and earn ten bucks and they
07:51 find out that you earn ten bucks they
07:53 pull the whole grand so now you're down
07:56 nine hundred and eighty dollars a month
07:58 because you tried to go out and get a
08:01 job and better your life if you weren't
08:03 allowed to add it to the welfare
08:07 Universal income models let you keep
08:10 that income regardless of what you earn
08:12 you simply earn it on top of that money
08:15 now there have been countless studies
08:17 okay where they try to go at universal
08:22 income both the minimum and the
08:23 guaranteed models and try to figure out
08:25 what would happen if we turn these
08:28 things on in modern Western societies
08:30 now you can just ask the French how much
08:33 they like it the yellow vests protesters
08:35 to go out every weekend in Terre Paris
08:37 they're not real happy with it all right
08:40 Brazil at the country that is like in a
08:44 bloodbath
08:45 24/7 as of 2019 they have it to now
08:50 working out not working out double not
08:52 working out Canada is play with it a
08:54 little bit hasn't turned it on I I think
08:59 I have read in the last year that a lot
09:02 of regions that have turned it on I
09:03 found it really disrupted Society some
09:09 of the stuff that you will see the sort
09:11 of universal income explained and really
09:15 quickly or what have you
09:17 when it comes right down to some of the
09:19 more susceptible areas of of abuse they
09:26 just they start doing I don't want to
09:30 say doublespeak but they kind of double
09:31 speak and triple speak I mean they just
09:33 go into nonsensical statements of which
09:36 have circular logic problems and they
09:40 just go on to the next thing it's really
09:42 funny I just thought really funny
09:43 animated one today now one of the big
09:47 things is that if you gave someone this
09:49 kind of money then would they sit at
09:51 home and do nothing
09:53 well Universal income is never supposed
09:56 to be so high that that is very easy to
09:59 do but I will tell you regardless if
10:02 you've ever done it every human being on
10:05 earth needs a sabbatical at some point
10:08 in their lifetime I've had them forced
10:10 on me through recessions right when I
10:12 lost my game company I just do my
10:15 clients disappearing I mean my some of
10:17 my clients were other game companies
10:18 right they were using me to create the
10:21 type of games that they didn't create
10:22 you know as I've said several times I
10:25 got phone calls from best friends of
10:26 mine from the game industry with 20-year
10:28 pedigrees shutting down their companies
10:31 I'm he's just and and they weren't
10:32 failing that was the crazy thing it was
10:34 just money was just evaporating just
10:37 like the 29 crash like what am i cutting
10:41 friends companies his company was called
10:42 airplay they created a genius game where
10:46 he could play along any type of sporting
10:48 game on your phone live making
10:51 predictions about what was gonna happen
10:52 and it was brilliant it was successful
10:56 it was growing it was blowing up and
10:59 their investors just got clobbered by
11:02 this fake subprime loan scandal thing
11:04 and shut the doors I got a call December
11:08 I think it was probably December 2009
11:12 and he said we're shutting our doors
11:14 where they said if we paid you up on
11:17 everything I said yep you know sorry
11:19 buddy if I had known you know I would
11:22 have lowered my rates a little bit and I
11:23 go look nothing what I've helped we
11:26 don't have payroll we'd have rent but
11:29 now imagine this situation
11:30 with universal income I think they had
11:33 about 50 employees now if everyone's
11:35 pulling down 50 grand a month you know
11:37 combined then maybe when a company dips
11:41 really hard they could all go back to
11:43 their homes you lose the office everyone
11:45 kind of agrees the benefits just just
11:47 vanished or whatever but they could hold
11:50 the company together until the economy
11:51 rebound and their clients rebound some
11:54 of you sitting in your living room have
11:56 some great ideas well maybe this could
11:58 just few Liam you literally
12:00 strategically go I'm gonna move into a
12:01 hotel I may have my laptop and I don't
12:05 know a camera and I'm gonna do whatever
12:06 I do to make money it might open up some
12:09 opportunities but one of the biggest
12:12 concerns was that you know there's a
12:15 stereotype that all homeless people use
12:19 the money to go buy alcohol drugs
12:22 tobacco and that's all they do now
12:28 we know and it does occur in certain
12:31 circumstances mostly due to depression
12:33 is why these things occur but is
12:37 actually a very low percent the people
12:40 that do it so what this would do is keep
12:43 people from starving to death and if you
12:45 see a homeless person talking to
12:47 themselves I guarantee you it's
12:49 malnutrition it is not them necessarily
12:52 being crazy now I am sure that someone's
12:55 been mentally ill and that caused them
12:58 to be homeless but I don't think that's
13:00 the majority of people I don't the
13:03 sabbatical is huge because what happens
13:05 what it's a sabbatical and I mean that
13:07 you basically lose your job and you
13:10 spend like a minimum of six months just
13:11 figuring out who you are in the middle
13:13 of your life it's not necessarily a
13:15 midlife crisis whatsoever it's quite the
13:18 opposite it's a midlife identity
13:23 clarification moment it's not even an
13:25 identity crisis I mean you might find
13:27 out you've been pretending to be someone
13:29 you're not but that's every time you
13:30 figure out something like that the
13:32 beautiful thing is is that you see
13:34 you're becoming more happy with yourself
13:36 every second it's interesting I don't
13:40 want you guys to lose any of your
13:42 possessions and your comforts in life
13:43 but if you do get
13:44 pushed into an unemployment situation
13:47 make sure you take the time to figure
13:49 out who you are and what you want what
13:51 your goals are whether or not you need
13:52 more education to get those goals watch
13:54 all my episodes on how to get that kind
13:56 of stuff going right now the other thing
13:59 about a lot of these welfare programs is
14:03 they can be ganked by people who aren't
14:06 citizens well every universal income
14:09 model is based on proving you're a
14:11 citizen Wow
14:13 for those of you believe in border
14:15 control and not giving away all of our
14:17 hard-earned money through you know all
14:21 these assistent things might be a really
14:23 good first step you know some of the
14:27 other things that they've done
14:28 statistics on statistics on is they look
14:33 at the average companies in America and
14:35 they've done you know incredible studies
14:37 from from groups that go in like the
14:39 Bob's from office space and they found
14:43 that only 33 percent of employees are
14:45 actually productive at work eighteen
14:48 percent hate their jobs and the rest of
14:52 them are just simply physically
14:54 president work but don't do anything so
14:58 the 33 percent keeps everyone employed
15:02 so now imagine those people that hate
15:06 their jobs the 18 percent or so have
15:08 $1,000 a month well maybe they could
15:12 pull back but one maybe they wouldn't be
15:14 some miserable because they have a
15:15 little bit of ancillary income but they
15:17 might pull back and go get the education
15:19 that they need with the extra money or
15:21 pull out and look for a better job
15:23 that's more suited to what they really
15:24 want to do and thus be happy and be a
15:26 part of the 33% which if you shrink to
15:29 18 maybe the productive part of society
15:33 would grow now again if this was to be
15:38 deployed in any country where you never
15:40 had this option before the sort of let's
15:44 all take a break thing might occur it
15:47 might be this weird bell curve in the
15:49 chronology of this deployment such that
15:52 everyone he goes geez you know if you
15:55 live in the Midwest Tennessee Kentucky
15:57 cans
15:58 somewhere in there where you can live
15:59 off $1,000 a month because your rinse
16:02 only 400 and this is all non taxed so
16:05 you get the whole thousand bucks and
16:06 somehow you just know how to cook and
16:09 scrimp and you got a garden and you go
16:11 fish for your food or whatever hunt then
16:14 maybe you can live off thousand you just
16:15 take take a year off maybe two years off
16:18 just to sort yourself out but eventually
16:19 everybody usually gets to a point where
16:21 they need to be productive in society
16:23 and they'll end up sometimes people go
16:26 off and create products that they they
16:28 just did because they like it they're
16:30 like I'm never gonna work in the coal
16:31 mine anymore I'm just gonna go home and
16:32 be a carpenter and then all of a sudden
16:34 people want to buy their tables and
16:36 chairs and they're like oh my god I'm
16:37 making so much money off my hobby which
16:40 is not my career and I have Universal
16:43 income in case I get sick or whatever
16:45 now I secretly think that universal
16:48 income since we do have so much
16:51 corruption in the world and it seems to
16:52 be being being pushed by the absolute
16:55 bonafide corrupt politicians in this
16:58 world like unanimously being pushed by
17:02 horrible people that this isn't in the
17:06 21st century in the early first quarter
17:09 of 21st century this isn't meant to help
17:12 anyone this is meant to be a
17:13 bait-and-switch wolf in sheep's clothing
17:16 that's what I think can we make it work
17:20 if we could all become intelligent and
17:21 get on the same page and be empathetic
17:23 towards other people's suffering which
17:24 means you're burdening other people with
17:26 your existence meaning you're not
17:27 working sure if we could solve for all
17:29 those problems we'd be fine but we can't
17:32 here's one of the rubs and there's many
17:35 but here's one of them and again let's
17:37 just be really straightforward no one on
17:41 planet Earth has figured this out the
17:44 smartest people in the world haven't
17:45 figured this out the only thing I can
17:47 think of is the only thing that they
17:49 figured out is that they can control the
17:50 living [ __ ] out of us with this sort of
17:52 thing but now imagine you have a
17:55 distributed portfolio of income invested
17:58 in things right why do you do that
18:00 because if one thing crashes you have
18:02 other things that might be doing well
18:03 other sectors you invest a little bit in
18:05 tech a little bit of precious metals a
18:07 little bit of this a little bit of that
18:10 well the current distribution of welfare
18:14 programs believe it or not provides a
18:16 little bit of security for citizens that
18:18 needed because in order to change any
18:21 one area of welfare or supplementary
18:26 income unemployment lobbyists and
18:29 politicians and state officials and
18:31 federal officials and you all have to
18:33 agree on how that change is going to
18:35 take place
18:36 and believe me you touch those programs
18:38 you're going to have the people up your
18:39 butt really quickly like your Social
18:41 Security reform would be one of the most
18:43 difficult things to do rather than
18:46 extending the age come on suddenly they
18:48 seem to be able to push that one through
18:50 so there's a little bit of reinforcement
18:53 one goes away one's still there if
18:55 everything comes down to universal pipe
18:58 if either guaranteed or minimum income
19:01 then all they have to mess with is one
19:03 thing and it could all be destroyed or
19:07 it could end up destroying a country
19:09 because they can't afford it how many
19:12 politicians do you know right now who
19:15 are guaranteeing all kinds of crazy [ __ ]
19:18 okay they're telling the blacks today
19:22 that as long as you have I guess I know
19:24 they're gonna have like a meter on your
19:25 skin you know it's gonna be a DNA test
19:28 or something they're gonna give you 40
19:30 acres and a mule basically reparations
19:33 right again who's gonna pay for that you
19:36 know can if I prove that I wasn't in the
19:38 country by the time that all this
19:40 happened or my my family did the same
19:42 exact thing do I get immunity from
19:44 sacrificing my taxes into this if some
19:47 guy comes in from Kenya thirty years ago
19:51 or even a hundred years ago there was no
19:54 slavery does he get no income from this
19:56 whole thing I mean they've been
19:57 promising just crazy crazy [ __ ] the was
20:02 Elizabeth Horan came up with some fifty
20:04 trillion dollar thing recently to do
20:06 something Bernie Sanders like we'll just
20:08 pay for everything okay you've seen this
20:13 happen it's what these scumbags do to
20:16 get votes from morons to get into office
20:18 and just like all the politicians before
20:21 Donald Trump promises never kept
20:24 right and more so than promises never
20:26 kept you have liars lying 24/7 in I just
20:30 mentioned in the previous episode but
20:32 Obamacare was nothing but a huge [ __ ]
20:36 deception every single thing this guy
20:40 said that this would be was the opposite
20:42 it's just like Satan worshipping right
20:44 everything's twisted backwards opposite
20:47 by the way
20:49 I've severed a conversation with a
20:51 friend of mine and we were talking about
20:54 the fact that the word bad in the 80s by
20:59 Run DMC was made popular by Run DMC you
21:02 know bad was not bad being but bad but
21:05 bad being good and it started the
21:07 reverse polarity in our brains of
21:10 changing symbology what was bad was good
21:14 and what's the sameness do exactly that
21:16 does it matter if you don't believe in
21:18 that [ __ ] you're not a Christian I'm not
21:20 a Christian necessarily I believe some
21:22 of the doctrines fantastic but they do
21:25 and they do their thing and then
21:27 interesting so what is the goal what is
21:32 like some of the other globalist goals
21:34 of universal income you've been hearing
21:38 this thing and this is just absolutely
21:40 [ __ ] hilarious okay think about this
21:43 the redistribution of wealth theory it's
21:48 the Robin Hood theory you get to sit on
21:50 your ass while the people work hard and
21:52 then you say your money is my money
21:53 right it's like a bomber run around
21:55 saying you didn't build your own company
21:57 boy I don't have enough expletives to
22:00 give that guy for saying that it's like
22:02 this POS you know lied about everything
22:07 in this entire life to get everything he
22:08 has well of course he's completely
22:10 deluded about what it takes to make
22:11 anything occur right so who will tell
22:15 you that we should redistribute all the
22:18 wealth more often than not ironically
22:22 bizarrely rich people rich people tell
22:26 you that we should redistribute the
22:28 wealth and we should go to a socialistic
22:29 system the amount of multi
22:33 multi-millionaire Democrats who preach
22:36 this stuff is on
22:38 real remember Pelosi should be worth
22:41 around eight million dollars if she
22:44 could keep every penny she's ever earned
22:46 since she's been in office in the early
22:47 90s and I heard she was a silver spoon
22:50 snob when she was a little kid but let's
22:54 just say she's not that him she's earned
22:57 eight million DOS well the chick is

24:09 same thing if this by the way they're
24:11 paid for it by the tax dollars of the
24:13 English citizens is really funny the
24:15 chick owns a double-digit amount of land
24:18 on this planet and she receives the
24:19 dividends of the taxes of that land from
24:22 countries and banks that she owns the
24:24 Windsor you know Queen Elizabeth and
24:26 they're still giving her as of 2001 it
24:28 was like 44 million pounds of years

24:33 million pounds in 2019 or more why are
24:36 they paying any money that family's more
24:38 wealthy than you could possibly imagine
24:39 but it's just another stupid tax on
24:42 people that want to worship dinner

25:06 give a [ __ ] whether or not you sink into
25:08 the ocean or not I have faith in you to
25:12 be your own country but these rich
25:15 people never distribute their wealth
25:17 right
25:18 I've lived 50 years on this planet
25:20 roughly okay in my lifetime the only
25:24 thing I've heard recently wanted Donald
25:27 Trump doing all kinds of philanthropy
25:30 forlán through P celebrities doing it
25:33 Prince doing it like George Michael
25:35 doing it the gentleman that paid for all
25:39 the college degrees of all the all the
25:43 black kids in that black college amazing
25:46 right that's a real amazing human being
25:49 okay I haven't heard of a rockefeller
25:53 ever doing that I haven't heard of any
25:55 they have like Rockefeller Foundation's
25:57 but we put our money in those
25:58 organizations and then they distributed
26:00 oh crease them it's a non-profit
26:03 it's your money where are the
26:06 Rothschilds that liquidate their entire
26:08 savings and just say look we have more
26:11 money than we need we're gonna we made a
26:13 standard for ourselves we're keeping a
26:15 few billion dollars but we're giving
26:17 away a trillion we're giving away 50
26:19 trillion we're paying off everyone's
26:21 loans everywhere on planet Earth
26:22 it's gonna be a thousand years of
26:24 prosperous Rothschild living enjoy
26:29 taking them from you know the horrible
26:32 Satanists that we think they are right
26:34 up there - totally angelic empowering
26:37 the world never happens does it it never
26:41 happens but those are the people that
26:43 fuel socialistic programs as socialistic
26:46 transformations of countries for one
26:48 reason to control us to control you one
26:55 system where everyone has to suck up to
26:58 the state for absolutely everything no
27:01 independence no sovereignty
27:04 common-law well whatever the state
27:07 determines was common law at that point
27:09 what is suffering well I don't know ask
27:11 the state what is education I don't know
27:14 ask the state what happened in history
27:16 oh I don't know ask the state when it
27:20 comes to redistributing the wealth and
27:22 you ask people inside these Universal
27:24 income models this is where it gets
27:25 really cloudy really quick because what
27:29 do they say they say well tax the rich
27:30 more MORE why I mean yeah there's some
27:36 trust fund babies out there you could
27:37 make a case for they inherited all their
27:39 money but come on that's what their
27:40 family earned in the past gave to their
27:42 kids and this if you're jealous you're
27:44 jealous but it doesn't mean I get to
27:46 take away their aventador just cuz
27:48 they're sixteen years old and they can
27:49 afford it amen
27:52 it's what their family earned if they
27:55 want to hand out a bunch of stuff to
27:58 their kids they will they're destroying
27:59 their kids lives for one thing it's like
28:02 a Turkish prison right pull someone in
28:05 give them everything they want for ten
28:07 years straight then kick them out
28:08 they're absolutely destroyed they don't
28:11 know how to care for themselves they've
28:12 lived the most lavish world they could
28:15 possibly live in just like coming to
28:17 America Eddie Murphy's world the first
28:19 act it's a Turkish prison for him it
28:21 wasn't a prison but if you lived in that
28:24 world will you if you're a man you get
28:25 all the women that you want if you're a
28:27 woman you'd all the men that you want
28:28 your food is amazing your amenities are
28:31 amazing and then you kick them out after
28:33 ten years that's what they used to do to
28:36 their enemies that's what it took as
28:39 prisoners it's not what you it's not
28:41 some horrible spot in South America and
28:43 somewhere in prison it's a palace well
28:47 that's what these rich people do to
28:49 their kids when they hand out all that
28:50 money they destroy them I've seen it
28:56 happen to friends of mine who were
28:57 famous actors they turned 18 they got
28:59 the trust fund completely [ __ ] gone
29:02 and 18 months these kids are utterly
29:04 broke and nobody wants to hire them
29:06 anymore but now this is where
29:11 we have to look at the fabric of society
29:13 a little bit I have told you several
29:16 times in old episodes about the friends
29:19 of mine who were in their 60s and 70s
29:21 who lived through the hippie era and
29:25 they were hippies one was way more of a
29:29 hippie than the other one but both of
29:32 them tested the idea of the commune this
29:37 place where a bunch of people get
29:38 together they pick out a plot of land
29:39 and they say we're just gonna live off
29:42 the land we're gonna be here we're all
29:43 gonna work together someone's gonna give
29:45 food someone's gonna get water someone's
29:47 gonna get everything else wash the
29:49 clothes feed the kids whatever it is
29:51 we're all gonna distribute all these
29:52 tasks in every single scenario the
29:59 highest amount of people that
30:00 contributed after about 45 days was 3%
30:05 that's the highest these are two
30:08 different guys that were in two
30:09 different areas of the world
30:12 experimenting with the common thing had
30:14 the exact same thing happened now these
30:15 are a lot of young kids but they're
30:17 they're very privileged white kids doing
30:20 this there's kids of all races there but
30:23 overall it's it's predominantly America
30:25 and the 60s right who have the ability
30:29 to run off and do these kind of things
30:30 right so what's interesting about it is
30:34 that at least in one case one of my
30:36 friends said look we realized that this
30:39 was happening and so the 3% said screw
30:44 all these other folks and I don't know
30:46 you know I don't know what the numbers
30:47 are but they went off and created
30:49 another economy and they said look we're
30:52 gonna make rules as soon as you don't
30:54 contribute your kickdown all right so
31:02 they won't offer created another one and
31:03 then each person that you know from the
31:06 97% that are starting to disintegrate
31:08 because they realize they're a bunch of
31:09 losers right so as some of them migrated
31:13 around they came to this new one and the
31:15 guys said look as soon as you don't
31:18 contribute if you go 24 hours and you
31:21 don't contribute you're at
31:23 here are you good with that yes oh yes
31:26 oh my gosh couldn't believe it I can't
31:28 believe anyone would ever do that
31:29 blah blah blah they built up another
31:31 mass of people when right back to the
31:35 same old number 97 3 the other 3 left
31:40 never came back to a commune
31:41 the funny thing is is those 3 percent
31:43 went off to be extremely professional
31:45 folks let them have Oscars and you watch
31:47 their movies and I watched their movies
31:48 when they were kids and what we were
31:50 kids right but they worked really really
31:52 hard because they realized that there is
31:55 a fabric of of the unit of the society
31:57 on this planet that are simply a bunch
32:01 of good-for-nothing losers okay they
32:05 simply don't see that they are burdening
32:07 other people with their existence now
32:09 this is something low you know
32:10 centralized to late 60s early 70s sort
32:12 of behavior I don't know if this exists
32:15 in 2019 who knows what would happen
32:16 there are there are plenty of functional
32:18 communes in the world but they you
32:22 should usually don't have that many
32:23 people and they usually have super high
32:25 IQs and they're doing something else
32:27 with their time they're doing a research
32:28 or what have you - you're not just
32:30 living out in some Indian Reservation or
32:34 some other location right now the other
32:38 model which is sort of fascinating is
32:42 that you know I can't do the math right
32:44 off my head but I would say well you do
32:46 a little bit of math let's just say we
32:49 took all of America 350 million people
32:51 split it in half so 150 million of
32:54 actual adult working individuals people
32:58 of adult age they can get this minimum
33:01 universal income we give them all $1,000
33:05 a month and then what do they do they
33:07 have to spend it okay
33:10 well that creates an economy that
33:12 creates currency right goes into
33:13 currents washes up against banks right
33:16 and all that great terminology they use
33:18 in banking all right in America that
33:24 would be at least I don't know 150
33:28 billion dollars a year well that goes in
33:32 a big circle they estimate that over
33:35 eight years in
33:36 America if they were to give all working
33:39 adults this Universal income at $1,000 a
33:42 month that they might be able to raise
33:45 the GDP up to 12% sounds interesting and
33:50 again you can always make numbers lie
33:53 you can make numbers tell the truth it
33:55 just depends on who's pushing this thing
33:58 again the thing that really concerns me
34:00 about this thing is that you didn't have
34:04 Cyprus that did this I believe in 2013 I
34:07 don't know when Brazil started doing
34:09 this but they've started to do this and
34:10 it doesn't look like the videos that I
34:12 see coming out of Brazil are individuals
34:15 that are getting any equivalency of
34:17 $1,000 of their money per month and
34:20 again if your money isn't worth much
34:23 then there's a there's a bit of an issue
34:25 the question of inflation was itwas and
34:30 has been brought up several times
34:32 against a universal income model for me
34:36 it seems very dangerous on that level
34:38 but what's funny is everybody who's into
34:41 this that's when they start going to
34:42 their jibber-jabber you know they start
34:44 going into their frontier gibberish if
34:47 you are familiar with Blazing Saddles
34:48 and you start to try to pay attention to
34:51 a sentence everything that they've said
34:53 about universal income up to that point
34:55 makes sense and then I'll suddenly get
34:56 to this and there they're like look over
34:58 there and they run over you know run
34:59 away but it all comes back to this total
35:03 of it's not an issue with universal
35:08 income they have one of the studies I
35:11 read was they were just say baby boiling
35:14 all these numbers down and then they
35:15 really talked about paragraph to
35:17 paragraph about how this could go this
35:18 way or the other thing at the very end
35:20 the conclusion was but we think it won't
35:23 happen
35:24 we don't think inflation is even
35:26 possible in this and I don't know how
35:29 that's that's the case because the rest
35:32 of the economy still goes right the if
35:36 let's just say America generates I think
35:38 we generate about three and a half
35:39 trillion dollars a year in revenue
35:42 corporations people all together right
35:46 Universal income wouldn't remotely be a
35:51 might be a fraction of a percent still
35:53 of all the income going in circles so
35:55 that income is still subjugated to
35:57 whatever the economy is doing if we got
36:01 into a war the problem is is that the
36:04 war might might make you spend a
36:08 tremendous amount of money and then
36:10 you're quantitatively easing if there's
36:12 another scandal in banking what the hell
36:14 is gonna stop that from screwing up all
36:16 the economy and again if you have
36:18 another crappy president like the woman
36:20 you had previous to the one we have now
36:21 and they serve the bankers like all the
36:24 presidents back to kid Kennedy rakin
36:27 these last good dude and after that it
36:29 was a hell on wheels
36:31 serving the bankers serving the elite of
36:34 the world or whatever we're not free of
36:37 any of that stuff
36:38 so then what happens to a thousand
36:40 turned into two thousand into whatever
36:41 don't know now the definition of minimum
36:46 basic income is if you simply drew a
36:49 line that says look this is poverty
36:52 wherever country whatever country you're
36:54 in proportional how much money you get
36:56 the minimum basic income is supposed to
36:59 go up to and just above poverty now of
37:03 course there are plenty of individuals
37:05 that are looking at the numbers and
37:06 going well geez we need to bring it up
37:08 to a middle-class level of living such
37:13 that you simply don't have to work you
37:18 know what's funny is is that it's such a
37:24 depending on your your personality
37:26 depending on you think what you think
37:28 your personal responsibilities are in
37:29 the world it's a fun thought because
37:33 Universal income seems almost like a
37:35 monthly lottery if I said to you what
37:39 you vote for something where you didn't
37:40 have to work ever again I mean jeez
37:43 initially you're like well yeah of
37:45 course you just impulsively boom yeah of
37:47 course and then you slow down and you
37:50 regain your faculties and you look at
37:52 society and look at your kids and you
37:54 look at the world and you look at the
37:55 accomplishments of your country and the
37:57 innovation of individuals that did
38:00 things because they were broke and there
38:02 were no well
38:03 programs back in the day of any of any
38:06 level right and they became amazing you
38:09 know again I've mentioned this several
38:12 times what I just listened to a tenor to
38:14 interviews from Little Richard Little
38:17 Richard was washing dishes at a
38:19 Greyhound bus stop and he was singing
38:23 like 2d fruity and all these other tunes
38:25 that he was sort of writing he'd been
38:26 kind of playing with the lyrics since he
38:28 was a kid and it was that level of
38:30 poverty that got him to start to pursue
38:33 his music in fact he went into music
38:36 came out washed dishes and then went
38:38 back in James Brown James Brown talks
38:41 about it all the time he's like look I
38:43 was broke married with kids I was
38:45 singing at a church leading the band and
38:48 I started taking the you know the the
38:52 beats that we were developing in the
38:54 church and started putting mature lyrics
38:56 on it and then Kapow we have the
38:58 godfather sold a lot of broken families
39:02 they created a lot of amazing people now
39:04 we have some people that were spoon fed
39:07 a lot of cash and they actually turned
39:09 out to be okay as well some good some
39:12 turned out to be good some turned out to
39:13 be pretty evil you know I don't know I
39:18 didn't pursue my dreams because I was
39:20 broke as a kid you know I you know by
39:23 about 13 years old I started working
39:25 professionally with a w-2 and so I took
39:28 care of a lot of my I took care of all
39:32 my elective objects and like my
39:34 strategic resources was still being
39:36 provided by my father and my
39:38 grandmother's and that sort of thing
39:39 like eating and shelter I didn't pay for
39:42 that stuff but by the time I was 18
39:44 really technically 17 I was paying my
39:48 own way full room and board everything I
39:50 was out working my butt off but you know
39:53 I was fortunate to have skills that paid
39:55 the bills and so I didn't really get
39:58 close to poverty at any point in time
40:00 but I can tell you you know I have been
40:04 as close to penniless and in my adult
40:06 life as anybody can get use my
40:09 unemployment up use some savings up used
40:11 up some inheritance at one point in my
40:13 life and the phone rang I kept
40:17 skills sharp and got a great job I don't
40:21 know I don't know what I would do if I
40:23 had enough money to sit around and be in
40:25 the middle class seems scary now we do
40:31 have again as we've mentioned in several
40:33 episodes and season four and some that
40:36 are coming up here in five that we have
40:40 a bit of an issue with education right
40:43 education is the way that we're going to
40:45 get past all of our woes boy the curve
40:48 is now I should say the the deficit we
40:53 have in education is so deep that we're
40:57 going to have to work really really hard
41:03 just to get back to the average mean of
41:06 America in 1955 now one of the little
41:13 segments they go through and they talk
41:15 about how feasible is it to turn on
41:17 universal income because they need to
41:19 find a bunch of money now again the
41:25 catch-22 the paradox a loop that you
41:29 have with this entire problem is is that
41:31 if you gave people a bunch of money you
41:35 would have less income it less
41:37 additional income in some cases by
41:41 giving someone two grand a month or
41:43 three grand a month or whatever puts
41:45 them in the middle class they will not
41:46 go and generate that 10 grand a month
41:48 that they would have they had a
41:49 necessity to get a job because it's it's
41:53 most likely the case that with most
41:56 people's average to above-average
41:58 intelligence they won't be able to find
42:02 jobs that are paying as low as even a
42:06 guaranteed minimum income the other
42:07 model think about the innovation that
42:12 will never occur because no one has the
42:13 mother of invention anymore that's
42:16 paramount to your culture blowing up
42:21 what they talk about is you know cutting
42:24 a bunch of other programs to pay for
42:26 this sort of thing well in America we
42:28 could probably just cut unemployment
42:30 cut welfare and all the different types
42:34 of assisted programs as long as the
42:37 amount of money that you get give to a
42:39 person who needs it is equivalent to
42:41 that income now what I don't know is how
42:45 they handle children I've never heard
42:46 anyone addressed the child thing but now
42:50 imagine this we all know people that
42:54 gink welfare this has been going on
42:56 since it was invented once it's usually
43:02 only controlled by the females because
43:04 they have the uterus and they make
43:05 children but once you can teach a person
43:09 on welfare that if you have a child you
43:11 get an extra credit of welfare payments
43:15 welfare food stamps and all this other
43:18 subsidies they will go out
43:21 I've known hundreds of cases of this ok
43:24 where women will have as many children
43:27 as possible so they're they're rolling
43:30 in cash now imagine a child a baby's
43:34 also allocated $1,000 just simply
43:36 because it exists in it's a citizen ok
43:39 what stops a ghetto person of any color
43:44 of any place and they're all over the
43:46 place of all races ok this is not a
43:48 racist thing at all why wouldn't they
43:52 have you know eight kids and then it's a
43:55 grand a month
43:57 why wouldn't they we have to find a way
44:01 to regulate that and let me tell you
44:03 that has never been regulated that I
44:05 know of maybe you have some information
44:07 I don't know again I can't claim
44:10 anything in foreign countries I simply
44:12 don't know my personal perspective comes
44:16 from my personal life experience with
44:18 this coming from a really really small
44:20 town where I definitely saw people
44:22 living on Social Security you know every
44:27 town typically has a large area of the
44:32 center of the town which is sort of your
44:33 middle class and it varies here and
44:36 there depending on if there's two income
44:37 household and up in the 70s you only had
44:39 to have one so the the mom worked after
44:41 the kids were in school
44:43 they were doing really well put money
44:44 away going on vacations I could kind of
44:46 good stuff but we always had our we had
44:49 our small country club little area where
44:52 the people are more wealthy their homes
44:54 are bigger still that way to this day
44:56 and then we have literally the opposite
44:59 two corners strips along the edge of
45:01 town which are incredibly destitute I
45:05 mean you could probably rent a house
45:07 there for $100 a month
45:09 if 100 150 a month you will not be
45:12 living large okay and your house is
45:14 going to Creek and and your neighbors
45:16 are gonna be you know suffering like you
45:18 are so on one side of the game you're
45:22 like well good this universal income
45:24 will allow people to spruce up their
45:27 lives a little bit yeah they're you know
45:29 one generation might have a bunch of bad
45:31 habits if someone is already an
45:32 alcoholic because they've been suffering
45:33 so long it might feed the alcoholism and
45:36 we're gonna lose that person a little
45:37 earlier because we're enabling it mm-hmm
45:40 not sure you can do anything about that
45:43 second tier would be your new generation
45:46 could potentially escape that area
45:49 because they don't have to be there
45:51 because they got the income with a low
45:53 education okay well if they can live and
45:56 perhaps there's other programs in there
45:59 there's always this sort of gray area
46:02 with universal income where you know
46:06 they say that in the minimum model you
46:11 typically have to take a test where
46:13 excuse me sorry the minimum all you
46:15 don't have to take the test they call it
46:16 a means test the guarantee model you
46:19 have to take a means test which means
46:21 typically you have to prove that you
46:23 need the money and then you get it
46:25 that's if you're completely unemployed
46:28 maybe you're going back to school they
46:30 usually force you to go to school you
46:32 know you can enroll yourself and a lot
46:34 of these programs but they have to be
46:36 accredited classes they get our trade
46:38 skills attach them careers attach them
46:40 etc etc obviously you know those are all
46:43 theoretical things that if we could if
46:47 we could figure that out you know most
46:49 the colleges would be defunded and shut
46:51 down because they're teaching crap you
46:53 know megatons a crap
46:56 so when I come in it from my own opinion
47:00 you know having spent I guess you could
47:03 say the majority of my pre 17 life in a
47:06 little country town in the middle of
47:08 America I've seen suffering I've seen
47:11 suffering with you know five kids you
47:14 know we're sorry three kids and two
47:15 parents where they will take any job
47:18 that is that is paying any money the
47:21 kids will take jobs the second they can
47:23 and they're very appreciative of their
47:24 jobs but unfortunately in some cases you
47:28 know what you know it's it's kind of a
47:30 duality of a pre-existing debt that they
47:33 can't pay off or someone gets sick
47:36 that's that's usually the one that kills
47:38 the family in the Midwest because
47:39 they're eating shitty food they're not
47:41 paying attention to a lot of other
47:43 health risks because they're being told
47:44 by the state that a lot of things
47:46 healthy that aren't healthy and it can
47:50 take the whole family down they don't
47:51 have insurance because they can't afford
47:53 the premiums and we can't get these
47:55 things wrangled you know what's crazy is
47:59 that we allow for insurance to be a
48:01 private-sector thing and I know that
48:03 that's going to go counterintuitive to
48:05 the Obama thing the Obama thing was
48:07 private insurance companies underwriting
48:10 federal policy and so that's why the
48:13 premiums have quadrupled since they
48:15 started it's insane it's insane coverage
48:18 right but if you created the same risk
48:20 pool management model which is insurance
48:23 at a federal level and simply said look
48:26 you can buy this policy where you're all
48:28 in a big three hundred fifty million
48:30 person pool screw all these private
48:32 companies we're gonna provide this hey
48:34 if you want to buy their private policy
48:36 you're more than welcome to pay it but
48:38 the one we pay the one you know the
48:39 insurance we give the Senators the
48:41 congressmen and the president and all
48:43 the administration people on the hill
48:44 which is this amazing insurance which
48:46 pays for everything no co-pays under
48:48 percent coverage if you know you're
48:51 having brain surgery you don't even need
48:53 to worry it's all paid for and you get
48:54 the best doctors in the world take that
48:57 program and spread it across the entire
48:59 country without a bunch of promises that
49:01 are broken we can't get to in this
49:05 country that model because we have
49:09 people
49:09 fighting for this old you know banker
49:12 designed model which is Obamacare once
49:16 we can just take that thing and cut the
49:17 head off and burn the body and it's gone
49:20 and we can start from scratch and it's
49:21 basically you know everyone might pay if
49:24 everyone paid a hundred bucks a month
49:27 the amount of young people paying for it
49:30 wouldn't get sick and again if we clean
49:33 up the water clean up the air clean up
49:35 the airwaves start educating on health
49:38 get people what's what's good for them
49:41 then the amount of people getting sick
49:43 will vanish considerably and so we'll
49:47 have all this money just sitting there
49:49 waiting for the one person who gets
49:50 cancer the one person that has some
49:53 congenital problem that manifested
49:55 through multiple generations and we can
49:57 take care of them like like we do our
49:59 vets I've said it several times in the
50:03 episode I've said it several times for
50:05 other policies in the world we have too
50:08 much corruption in the modern world in
50:11 the Western world to remotely touch
50:14 anything that is centralized in terms of
50:17 control and strategic resources for
50:20 human beings we have too much so this
50:24 stuff is all going to be translated into
50:26 a bait and switch situation promise one
50:30 thing screw them with another it's just
50:33 going to take place that's my humble
50:36 opinion there was a point let me just
50:40 give you the sort of the opposite model
50:42 the non handout model there is a point
50:47 and for those of you a longtime
50:49 listeners you know in the 70s in my
50:52 little hometown Chanute Kansas okay my
50:56 hometown was okay 1977 let's pick a year
51:01 we had so many independently owned
51:05 companies and businesses in my hometown
51:08 everyone was moving the money in a big
51:10 circle I've told this story long time
51:14 ago I'm gonna tell it again now there's
51:17 the old adage it's a little anecdote
51:20 about how money can work and how it
51:22 should work
51:23 specially in a small town an outside
51:27 businessman comes into a small town goes
51:29 into the hotel he says how much does it
51:32 cost to stay for a week here
51:34 this story's like in the eighteen
51:36 hundred's right guy they own the hotel
51:38 says 50 bucks guys ok you mind if I go
51:43 take a look at the room before I agree
51:46 he says sure he puts his $50 bill down
51:51 on the counter and goes upstairs to
51:53 check out the room very quickly the
51:56 hotel guy takes that money runs it down
52:00 the street and gives it to someone he
52:02 owes 50 bucks to let's just say a food
52:05 service that person owes someone else so
52:09 the debts paid to the hotel for 50 bucks
52:11 the food service guy had his truck break
52:14 down and he owes the cart repair guy 50
52:17 bucks he takes the 50 bucks down in the
52:20 car station car repair place pays that
52:22 debt off and the cart replay repair
52:25 place owes the the dry cleaners for his
52:29 uniforms 50 bucks
52:31 he takes it over to the dry cleaners
52:32 pays out the 50 bucks now the dry
52:35 cleaner owner is just a single dude he
52:38 owed the hotel 50 bucks for some reason
52:40 he takes it back to the hotel owner
52:42 gives him the 50 bucks says we got a
52:44 paid right we're good yep thank you so
52:47 much for paying your debt now the $50 is
52:50 sitting on the counter again at the
52:51 hotel the dude comes downstairs and says
52:54 you know I'm actually gonna stay with a
52:57 friend I just remembered takes this 50
53:00 bucks and walks out the door so the
53:04 hotel's
53:04 debts paid the food places paid off the
53:08 car places paid off the drycleaners paid
53:11 off and the money just went in a big
53:13 circle everyone got it paid off
53:16 that's how money is supposed to occur in
53:19 a closed-loop system in a country in a
53:23 state town and among the people the
53:28 second to introduce foreign exchange
53:32 with other countries the money can leave
53:35 your country and now
53:36 come back and anytime that will help
53:39 your country how many of you have heard
53:42 that we've got it's it's not as high
53:44 anymore cos China's selling it off but
53:46 China had loaned us like one and a half
53:47 trillion dollars in money I think it's
53:51 down quite a bit now because they've
53:53 been selling off all their notes getting
53:55 out of US currency that's a problem my
53:59 little hometown thrived in 1977 at least
54:04 electronic stores we had you know it's a
54:07 little tiny town with like 12,000 people
54:09 we had two ice cream places you know
54:11 plus Dairy Queen we had like four
54:14 grocery stores we had Main Street was
54:17 just packed with businesses on both
54:19 sides of the fence shoe stores and
54:21 cowboy
54:23 you know clothing stores and all kinds
54:24 of restaurants and you know we had our
54:27 drug stores and hotels and all this
54:30 stuff tons of it all booming the
54:34 psychiatrists removing the
54:36 chiropractor's from Kumi everything was
54:38 booming because the money went in a
54:40 beautiful circle all day long everybody
54:43 was paying it off it was great until
54:46 Walmart moved in technically moved in
54:49 1975 but it took a took a little while
54:51 to start having an impact by the mid 80s
54:54 ten years later you know I'm stupid
54:56 about this whole thing I worked for them
54:58 for 11 months Sam Walton was alive when
55:00 I was working for him it started to hurt
55:04 businesses because why would you buy
55:07 shoes downtown at the shoe store that's
55:11 been there for 50 years when you can go
55:13 get him at Walmart for cheaper there
55:16 shittier she was at Walmart made in a
55:18 foreign country but it was cheaper when
55:21 you're broke that's what you do
55:23 electronics
55:25 we had a very famous electronics store
55:28 my hometown had everything you ever
55:31 wanted it was just magical to go into
55:33 this place with everything just
55:35 beautifully set up demo rooms and all
55:37 this other stuff every guy in town would
55:38 outfit their home the guy was booming
55:41 and money music stores and all kinds of
55:45 stuff grocery stores grocery stores
55:47 would last to go because Walmart
55:50 expanded that shut down the first
55:51 building they built that I worked at and
55:53 built a superstore outside of town and
55:55 now they had a grocery store everybody
55:57 is so happy to be buying [ __ ] food from
56:00 Walmart letting their local grocery
56:03 stores with healthy organic food go out
56:05 of business it was an IQ test that my
56:09 town is still failing I mean they get an
56:11 F Plus every day if I'm not figuring out
56:14 this bottle and now Walmart is owned by
56:18 Europeans
56:19 thus they replace the Americans start
56:22 with the illuminated son and they farmed
56:24 out all the products to either India or
56:26 China or some other foreign country
56:29 Mexico South America nothing against all
56:32 those countries but if you want your
56:34 country to succeed you're going to have
56:35 to buy your own products it's just the
56:38 basic thing so when you think about when
56:42 I think about the destruction of America
56:44 and again Charlotte is Irby talked about
56:46 being briefed on this in the early 70s
56:49 her father was a skull and bones guy and
56:51 she did not agree with his doctrine she
56:55 wrote a beautiful book called the
56:56 dumbing deliberate dumbing down of
56:57 Americans she said there was a universe
57:00 sorry European could glamour that came
57:02 over she was in New England at the time
57:05 I don't know if she's still alive to
57:08 this day I think she is but they told
57:11 her how they were gonna dismantle
57:12 Central America which was the root of
57:14 all the values and systems that keep our
57:17 country together and they they did it
57:21 they succeeded and now we have to undo
57:24 it I don't know what a universal income
57:28 would do to a teeny tiny town because
57:30 that for me is where I take most of the
57:32 models of the universe that are proposed
57:35 in any country around the globe and I
57:38 take it to my little hometown I go what
57:39 would it do to my little hometown maybe
57:43 it would help maybe it wouldn't
57:45 now I know that there's a little bit of
57:48 a a centrifuge that can help little
57:53 hometowns which is honesty and integrity
57:56 because alone town you can't run your
57:59 mouth you can't backstab people more
58:02 than maybe a couple times before
58:03 you're literally ostracized you're
58:07 banished from the town because no one
58:09 wants to help you no one wants to be
58:10 with you your family is a Scarlet Letter
58:13 around your neck you're screwed but as
58:18 soon as you comes a big-city man it's
58:20 the opposite thing it's who can you
58:23 screw today because you know you can
58:26 because you can screw people and be rude
58:29 to them steal from them whatever and
58:31 you'll never see them you know and I'm
58:34 just I'm digressing a little bit into
58:35 the fabric of our society today to
58:38 reflect back on these these sort of
58:42 Robin Hood models because they don't
58:45 believe they work due to corruption
58:47 right in the big city just in case you
58:52 don't live in one when I'm sure that
58:53 most of you do but if you don't if you
58:57 were to leave your phone in my hometown
59:00 at a restaurant on the table out on a
59:03 park bench as long as somebody saw you
59:06 and knows who you are
59:07 well there's Fred over there he's with
59:09 this thing and then like an hour later
59:11 they fine or a day later they find the
59:13 phone on the on the bench or or a
59:14 waitress finds your booth and you've
59:17 left your phone on the seat they know
59:19 who they serve they know exactly where
59:21 to put it and you know where to call to
59:24 ask it other than my phone there and
59:25 you're like oh yeah you left it right
59:26 here
59:27 okay well I'll actually stay up a little
59:29 later so you can come down and get your
59:30 phone or you can call them at their
59:32 house and you'd be like if you meet me
59:33 done your restaurant like I need to use
59:35 my phone it's the only thing I gotta be
59:37 like yeah okay I'll go down there at
59:40 2:00 in the morning open it up and give
59:41 you your phone I like that in the big
59:44 city is it you leave your phone and a
59:46 nightclub at a restaurant what's wild is
59:50 the very next person that finds that
59:52 object is a goddamn thief it's it's
59:55 almost like the universe is balanced
59:58 that way in a big city you almost never
60:00 have anybody it brings it to you and
60:02 when it happens and I've had it I left
60:04 my wallet once at a at an ATM in the Bay
60:09 Area of all places and is dude grabbed
60:14 it and I forgot how he contacted me
60:17 but he was an old guy in a pickup and he
60:20 was like a Midwestern dude had moved to
60:22 the Bay Area and he had ethics and he
60:24 brought it back it was amazing but that
60:26 is SuperDuper rare SuperDuper rare man
60:30 how does that mean you know it's perfect
60:33 in little towns no no no but I mean if
60:34 you get your [ __ ] stolen in a little
60:36 town it's almost always some juveniles
60:38 male doing it what's really sad and I
60:43 hope it changes over time is that here
60:46 we have this thing called the internet
60:47 right we're all able to communicate with
60:48 each other globally technically speaking
60:52 the way that keywords trend online right
60:56 press covers this every once in a while
60:58 what was it Clinton body count as the as
61:00 of the recording of this episode is the
61:02 number one tracking are trending phrase
61:05 on the Internet how wild is that man but
61:09 what we haven't been able to do because
61:11 all social media at this point this
61:14 popular is controlled by the deep state
61:17 there's no real attempt to bring
61:20 together any one of these concepts to
61:22 spread it to the point where we can get
61:25 to where we need to go now Universal
61:27 income is being spread trust me that's
61:29 being spread because it leads to
61:31 socialism which leads to overall control
61:33 and socialism is sort of communism and
61:36 sheep's clothing right but we need to be
61:39 having global discussions one of the
61:42 most intelligent things I heard in one
61:43 of the presentations trying to describe
61:47 any form of universal income are the
61:51 cultural impacts on this concept there
61:56 are certain countries that would jump on
61:59 this and certain countries that would
62:00 not jump on this because they have pry
62:03 they realize this would be just an
62:05 undermining of the human condition and
62:07 so they'll resist some countries are so
62:10 broke they can't do it some people are
62:12 so rich where do you start begin like my
62:17 old co-host used to say to give you sort
62:19 of a perspective of how double-standard
62:22 the world is you have the Catholic
62:26 Church which is gigantic right the
62:29 number one real estate owner in the
62:30 world
62:31 I think that's true besides McDonald's
62:33 they have an ungodly amounts of money I
62:38 would estimate trillions of dollars in
62:42 real estate treasure possessions of all
62:44 kinds but need time there's a giant
62:48 tsunami that kills 280,000 people you
62:52 will never ever see a fleet of c-130s
62:55 come in with you know the Vatican on the
62:59 side or the Pope on the side or whatever
63:01 dropping off blankets and food for
63:04 anyone it never happens what happens the
63:07 Red Cross does it well who supports the
63:10 Red Cross we do so these super filthy
63:14 rich organizations which preach all of
63:16 this Jesus like a behavior are anything
63:20 but
63:21 christ-like can you imagine if Christ
63:24 showed back up on earth oh my god would
63:26 that not be the best thing ever
63:28 provided he's real but say he comes back
63:31 he goes straight to he just appears
63:33 inside the Vatican with the Pope sitting
63:36 on a throne in the snake room down the
63:38 Viper Room down in the basement right
63:41 what just that just the prospect of that
63:45 would be so amazing I think the Pope
63:47 which is light on fire the second he
63:48 shows up into the room but let Majan you
63:52 know we have a catastrophe and it's the
63:55 precursor to Christ's showing back up on
63:57 earth and now we have millions and
64:01 millions of people hurt for whatever
64:02 reason meteorite whatever tsunami
64:05 earthquake whatever and he says work you
64:12 get off your asses were liquidating all
64:15 this we're liquidating every single
64:18 thing in this place and you were going
64:20 to spend every last dime and you're
64:22 gonna sell this building everything goes
64:24 because we're gonna save humanity
64:27 because that's what I did when I was
64:28 here I bathed the feet of prostitutes
64:34 healed lepers you know you know it's
64:37 funny you read that book and you're like
64:38 okay is his intentions were pretty clear
64:41 and if you tell me that you believe this
64:43 guy is real
64:44 and this is the way you behave nuts nuts
64:50 right so part of the part of the
64:54 systemic issue that is never discussed
64:56 is why is everybody poor why is there
65:01 poverty everywhere why is a you know the
65:05 majority of the world at about an 85 IQ
65:09 or lower why is that education I mean
65:16 give me a break you're gonna set tell me
65:18 that that's expensive not really you
65:22 know when I was a kid we we would get
65:25 our books for school you know you get
65:29 you had to go get your books from the
65:30 class and you know this big giant thing
65:32 of books with you you push you know push
65:35 them in your locker and you grab it
65:36 enough books out so you wouldn't have to
65:38 be them to be late between your trips to
65:39 classes if you happen to have a class
65:41 next to your locker then you'd unload
65:43 and reload it's like your little gun of
65:45 knowledge but what were the books the
65:47 books were purchased upon on every five
65:50 to ten years and you'd open up the first
65:52 flap of the book and inside you'd have
65:55 to write your name because this was your
65:57 book but you would also see all the
65:58 previous students that had the book
66:00 before you okay so the school invested
66:03 in the book if it runs ten years and the
66:05 books I don't know I mean they get a
66:07 discount because they're a school rain
66:08 they're subsidized by the state but even
66:11 the book was 50 bucks 50 bucks to teach
66:13 me French physics statistics probability
66:16 whatever English it goes for 10 years I
66:20 mean that's a profit right there in
66:21 terms of the GDP of a particular country
66:26 yeah we're gonna have to have one course
66:29 for a tribe in Africa versus course for
66:33 some folks in this and the slums of
66:35 India vs. Liverpool versus New York
66:39 versus LA in Kansas and China sure
66:42 everyone's at different levels so we got
66:45 to write a bunch of different books at
66:46 different levels we have to like in
66:48 education to what they already know you
66:50 know how do I talk about things on this
66:53 show I do analogies constantly a lot of
66:56 great teachers work through analogies
66:57 even if they're just
66:58 friends and not professors they'll say
67:00 well you know what it's like it's like
67:01 this boom boom boom boom are you saying
67:02 you're like pow but if they're a good
67:04 teacher they'll look you in the face and
67:06 they'll know something about you and
67:09 they say you know you know I used to
67:11 work at Walmart yeah yeah well it's just
67:13 like Walmart but it's this that's how
67:15 you were in the stock market and you're
67:16 like oh my god totally get it this Steve
67:20 Martin said it's a profit deal so
67:23 education is what is going to actually
67:25 fix all of this stuff you know and one
67:30 of the big questions was that well
67:32 people actually continue working in
67:34 ditches and sewers and all these jobs
67:36 that are perceived as being super bad
67:39 you know before the Mandela effect
67:41 changed to Eli Whitney was if you take
67:45 the childhood I had or he was a black
67:47 guy they pick cotton and figured out how
67:50 to he watched his hand and he figure out
67:52 how to make a cotton gin you know
67:54 pulling this stuff off he saw the
67:58 problem
67:58 so often that he fixed it again it's not
68:01 that way anymore it's a white guy from
68:03 Yale and never picked a bale of cotton
68:05 in his life so what about the guys that
68:10 do the jobs the guys and gals that do
68:13 the jobs that are sort of the jobs that
68:16 nobody wants to do who would be the most
68:19 qualified person to innovate those areas
68:22 of work and to profit from the
68:27 innovation they are you know if you were
68:31 some aristocratic silver spoon kid and
68:34 you want to put your name on the world
68:36 and you wanted to fix trash collection
68:38 you know trash collection is actually
68:40 pretty cool right live we got these
68:41 big-ass trucks that are gigantic and
68:44 they have these robot arms that come out
68:46 and grab it and throw the trash in it's
68:48 pretty cool somebody innovated that a
68:50 little bit probably could take it ten
68:52 steps further but what would you do you
68:54 would hire trash guys who knows how
68:59 smart they are maybe they're maybe their
69:01 utter geniuses but because they're still
69:03 pining citizens or whatever this is the
69:05 only job they can get maybe they're a
69:06 doctor you know I once had a massage
69:10 from a woman
69:11 and we got to talking afterwards and she
69:14 had moved here from China she actually
69:15 was visiting from China on a work visa I
69:18 said well what did you do in China she
69:19 goes I'm a doctor I said what kind of
69:22 duck she goes why I give birth to babies
69:25 so he said you're a full doctor right
69:28 yeah oh yeah yeah yeah series this chick
69:30 with a PhD she I said how many babies
69:33 you deliver she's hundreds I probably
69:34 done 450 she was pretty young at the
69:36 time okay she's she's doing what she
69:39 could do legally in this country because
69:42 her medical degree isn't transferable
69:44 over here I think she did really well
69:47 because I only saw her a couple times
69:49 you know part of the part of what is
69:54 being revealed especially by someone
69:55 like Candace Owens is this reverse
69:57 racism I don't want to get in a big
70:01 racism conversation but there is reverse
70:04 repression too which is to say if you
70:07 ever touch a particular job in your
70:09 lifetime then you are never to go over
70:12 what that kind of person that kind of
70:15 person would ever do you know in my
70:19 lifetime I'll give you a little I'll
70:21 give you a little hint how bad it is
70:22 right in my lifetime I have done many
70:26 many professions especially going to the
70:28 video game industry you know you start
70:30 off in tech support you do QA then you
70:32 get into being Associate Producer
70:33 there's two three levels of that and
70:35 then you move into if somebody dies in
70:40 the industry you can become a
70:41 full-fledged producer or you quit and
70:43 start your own company like I did and
70:44 you can do whatever the hell you want
70:46 but what's funny is as I reach back out
70:49 into the private sector because I wanted
70:50 to solve problems that weren't my
70:52 problems I wanted to work with groups of
70:54 people that I didn't hire I didn't have
70:55 to be the CEO all the time and chase the
70:57 money I just wanted to create great
70:59 things I bring my resume in there and
71:02 I've get this weird reversed
71:05 discrimination which was oh well you
71:09 used to do that now what do you do
71:12 and it was sort of like this this
71:14 attitude towards well you've already
71:16 done that and we're not gonna let you do
71:18 that anymore and I'm like what are you
71:20 talking about I mean wasn't that clear
71:22 but you know in the
71:24 in the interviews for these companies
71:27 you know I would sit there and I would
71:30 go well how long have you done your job
71:32 and how many years is you get to do that
71:36 job before someone takes it away from
71:38 you because you've done it too much I
71:39 got friends in the game industry have
71:41 been producers for damn near thirty
71:43 years and they are sought after because
71:45 they know how to do it really really
71:47 well they're still thriving industries
71:49 right and again if you're in the game
71:51 industry past a certain age they start
71:54 taking a crap on you which is why all
71:56 the games suck today rates why Hollywood
71:58 struggling to fur meet Universal income
72:02 is sort of like GMO foods but just in an
72:04 episode earlier today where I mentioned
72:06 a lot of this stuff hopefully I can
72:08 checker this release was something else
72:10 more interesting and more diverse but
72:13 it's tampering with the very
72:14 fundamentals of humanity with the most
72:20 corrupt officials ever in the history of
72:23 man running the running the world and so
72:29 I don't trust it I don't mind the
72:32 concept but I don't trust it and I'll
72:35 give you an I give you another thing is
72:37 I got a little bit more room on my stick
72:39 here one of the areas where I have a
72:44 motion to there's two sides to I'll give
72:46 you my opinion of the bureaucracy and
72:50 then I will show you an example where
72:51 it's ludicrous we know that when you
72:56 have to go to a state or country in your
73:00 federal level to get anything done to
73:03 process a piece of paperwork it can be
73:06 excruciating because you're behind all
73:08 these barriers and barriers and barriers
73:10 and why why governments littered
73:13 themselves with people that are only
73:15 left-brain with low IQs and I don't mean
73:18 to piss on anyone in particular but I've
73:19 run into plenty of these people and you
73:21 have to it baffles me why they don't
73:24 want super innovative people well they
73:25 can't pay them the money that they
73:27 deserve okay so it's one big problem but
73:31 now in America you have a fixed amount
73:34 of money as a particular citizen that
73:36 you must pay into
73:38 unemployment insurance every year now if
73:41 you make over a hundred thousand dollars
73:42 a year you can end up paying that off by
73:45 about mid-year like if you made a
73:49 hundred and thirty thousand dollars a
73:51 year in America you're done paying your
73:52 your unemployment insurance usually
73:55 around May June all right
73:57 you don't to pay any more your income
73:59 goes up it's kind of cool but I have
74:02 personally paid unbelievable amounts of
74:05 money into my unemployment insurance at
74:09 times I've been unemployed and I take
74:12 the break and I'm looking I'm developing
74:13 a new business you know one case I
74:15 developed a multi-million dollar
74:17 business by myself with one well sorry
74:19 with one other guy but just two of us
74:21 doing this and you know we use that
74:24 money to build up our contacts to get
74:27 everything in order to pay off the first
74:30 steps of the corporation of setting up
74:33 the phones of building a brand building
74:35 our websites you know and just closing
74:38 the first deal and getting the first
74:39 paycheck where again once you get the
74:41 paycheck you're an employment goes away
74:43 that's fine with me but in America you
74:46 only get your unemployment insurance for
74:48 six months and then they cut you off if
74:52 you're in a recession in Congress votes
74:54 for it
74:54 they'll extend your unemployment okay
75:00 but where'd the rest of my money go if I
75:04 were to get from now on for the day from
75:06 today to the day I die because there's I
75:08 forgot how many you have to go a year
75:11 something like that you're eighteen
75:12 months something like that before I can
75:14 apply for it again sort of thing right
75:16 but if I did it as as often as I could
75:19 between now and the day I die
75:20 I probably would make back all the money
75:23 I put into it if I go from now to 80
75:26 years old right that's weird
75:30 what if there is just a condition where
75:32 it's difficult to find a job for
75:35 whatever reason individuals need to be
75:38 able to get the money they put in if
75:41 someone you know people my hometown they
75:43 work for 20 years they put in their
75:45 money and then Elias six months of their
75:48 unemployment six months but they put 20
75:51 years in
75:52 well there's a bunch of people working
75:54 put new money in the system so they're
75:57 not out of money they just I don't know
75:59 what they do with it they siphon it off
76:01 they spend it they transfer it around
76:03 they buy bombs or whatever it is this is
76:06 the type of weird bureaucratic sort of
76:09 passive corruption that happens with
76:12 their money the second you get taxed and
76:14 it disappears I don't know I think it's
76:18 a 90 percentile rate that will that your
76:22 money will be spent unwisely and against
76:26 your wishes it's just a factor of the
76:30 world anyway it's something to think
76:34 about
76:35 I'd be very interested to hear if you
76:37 live in a country that has it whether
76:40 it's been successful if you've ever
76:42 studied it let me know what you think if
76:46 you live in France I don't know if I
76:49 have anyone from France I don't think
76:50 anyone's ever chimed in from France but
76:52 if you know people from France ask them
76:54 and relay it to us somewhere in the
76:57 YouTube comments and the LOC Facebook
76:59 group what have you it shouldn't be a
77:03 goal of any society or any planet on
77:06 earth to do this kind of thing unless we
77:10 have fully achieved our sort of gene
77:14 roddenberry world where corruption is
77:17 simply impossible at any mega level any
77:20 global level you're always gonna have
77:23 somebody stealing something at some
77:26 local level your buddies gonna borrow
77:27 ten bucks and never give it back and
77:29 when you ask for about three what ten
77:31 dollars you know that's gonna happen but
77:33 if we can't handle this huge broad
77:36 stroke thing then I think we need to
77:39 pause before we get a little excited
77:42 about this fake lottery ticket that's
77:45 going to come in because someone's got
77:46 to pay the bill the last thing we want
77:50 to do is is deter super successful
77:54 people from building businesses that you
77:56 could work for by taxing them to death
77:58 right oh and by the way one of the big
78:02 avenues that they think they're going to
78:03 use to fund this kind of thing as
78:05 taxation boy could you imagine once I
78:09 heard that in one of the analyses I was
78:11 like Jesus this is so corrupt it is so
78:16 aimed at being corrupt first we have the
78:18 most corrupt politicians doing this and
78:20 they're mentioning climate change and
78:22 climate taxation as a method of paying
78:23 for it so it's like we'll give you a
78:27 little bit of income if you let us take
78:28 away all your children if you let us put
78:31 our thumb on your really hard you can
78:33 have this thing for a little while until
78:35 until we got you completely controlled
78:37 and then we're going to take it away and
78:38 we'll just start you know correcting
78:42 that human meat grinder that was in Pink
78:44 Floyd the wall if you haven't been to
78:47 deep thoughts radio.com
78:48 well that's the coolest place to be
78:51 there's a search field there's a
78:53 category section there's links to our
78:56 video options which is currently YouTube
78:59 in bit shoot bright tea on never came
79:01 through they still can't take more than
79:03 10 videos and you have to do this I mean
79:07 really it's it's like a self censoring
79:09 platform the design is so atrocious they
79:11 shouldn't have opened the service until
79:12 they could figure out how [ __ ] you did
79:14 it I mean someone from Bright Young
79:16 should be making a call at [ __ ]
79:17 shooting going how the hell are you able
79:18 to take infinite videos because we can't
79:21 you know your audio choices are easy
79:25 Android and Mac Windows whatever all
79:29 support it just click the links it'll
79:32 take you right to the feeds social media
79:34 we have one really super interactive
79:37 group of people which is in the lock
79:39 Facebook group just know that when you
79:41 apply I have a little question for you
79:43 so say something human if you don't say
79:46 something human I might if I'm feeling
79:49 really happy that day take a look at
79:51 your profile and see if you're human
79:53 otherwise I block you and you're out for
79:55 life so if you interested in
79:57 participating in true dialog that's the
80:01 place to go I do have a Twitter account
80:02 for this channel currently you know it's
80:05 funny I was in a conversation with the
80:08 think tank of guys and this we got a
80:10 dude visit the conversation he was a
80:13 total expert in this and he's like
80:14 Twitter his dad he goes no one's using
80:16 Twitter he said
80:18 everyone's search engine in the world is
80:20 Google the second most popular search
80:23 engine is YouTube and Google owns both
80:25 of them it says Facebook is your number
80:30 one social media platform no one's been
80:32 able to dis dislodge then remember they
80:34 knocked out my space my space killed
80:37 Friendster you know unless there's the
80:41 revolution unless kim.com delivers his
80:44 big you know advertised social media
80:46 platform there won't be any competition
80:49 for a really long time if they regulate
80:51 the thing which I'm gonna make an
80:52 episode on it will Forge them into the
80:57 standard utility cause what people don't
80:59 understand there's a couple ways to
81:02 donate to the page one you can just
81:04 watch the videos but the second one is
81:07 patreon which is it lightens up quite a
81:11 bit during the summer time and as I've
81:15 said a hundred times there's a brand new
81:17 channel for season one there's two ways
81:21 to get that it's all been reality all of
81:24 its been read it now the podcasts are
81:26 all the same so I'm just if you want to
81:28 hear what it was like and hear the music
81:30 the way I wanted it to be the podcast is
81:32 the way to get the season one in its its
81:35 entirety off my website which they can't
81:36 censor thank God just give them time but
81:40 there's also a link directly to the
81:42 channel off the website again if you go
81:44 to the website and you watch any the
81:45 season 1 stuff you're guaranteed to be
81:47 watching what I want you to watch but a
81:52 lot of the videos were completely locked
81:53 out of Europe so you may have never seen
81:55 probably at least 20 videos the season 1
81:58 if you live outside the United States
81:59 especially in Germany there's a store
82:04 link which I haven't done anything with
82:05 I apologize but our viewer ships hanging
82:09 on the shadow banning is definitely
82:12 affecting the channel hugely I mean the
82:15 subscriptions are are pathetic and again
82:20 the people that have had I think the way
82:23 it's working is the people who have a
82:24 lot of interaction with the videos are
82:28 getting unsubscribed if they click the
82:30 bell the bells on the clicked
82:32 that I getting any notifications but a
82:34 lot of people are coming back saying I
82:36 was completely unsubscribe from your
82:37 channel I thought you disappeared
82:38 because everyone's anticipating the
82:40 channel getting turned off at some point
82:42 [ __ ] shoot is 1080p it looks like it's
82:46 doing really really well I don't think
82:48 they can take 4k but who cares still
82:50 looks good I mean you're not coming for
82:52 my my groovy smile but anyway appreciate
82:57 you all appreciate the conversation
83:00 please get involved the conversation if
83:02 you're having any thoughts and opinions
83:04 if you have suggestions for episodes let
83:07 me give you the manual to get your idea
83:09 into a show you need to become a little
83:12 producer you need to research it a
83:14 little bit for me I would say create 10
83:17 bullets which are the highlights of the
83:20 information that you have researched for
83:23 me again a producer doesn't just hand a
83:26 book to the the person who's doing this
83:28 show and go hey if you read this book
83:29 you're gonna have a great episode I'm
83:31 look at you like really they can get
83:33 time to read a book you should come see
83:35 all the books that are stacked up that I
83:36 need to read that people have sent me
83:38 for free it's crazy I owe everybody you
83:41 know the courtesy of really knows and I
83:43 can get to them so you interpret stuff
83:46 you know I've got a few great people who
83:48 are giving me you know miles of things
83:50 to read and I just don't have the time
83:53 so if you get in there and go boom boom
83:55 boom and you might give me page
83:57 references so if I do have to dive into
83:59 a 400 page book or some 10 hour video on
84:02 YouTube you got me some time codes where
84:05 I can go in and see the gist of what's
84:06 going on believe me I will get it and if
84:09 I am truly in entrapped by your idea
84:13 your suggestion I will most likely
84:15 consume 50 to 100 percent of everything
84:18 you give me because it just girl I mean
84:20 I'll take it to my smoke lounge for
84:22 further discussion so that's the best
84:25 way to get big ideas to me but a lot of
84:28 you just have one sentence for those
84:30 probably dozen individuals who I've
84:33 called up by name or at least I've we've
84:35 linked up somehow you know I did the
84:37 video because you suggested it great
84:40 suggestions agree suggest and more
84:42 simple and profound it is the better
84:44 like this was just
84:45 Universal income I asked a friend got
84:48 interested did some research combine all
84:51 my previous experience and boom we have
84:52 an episode and on the subject of
84:55 episodes until the next one take care
84:58 yourself and someone else and I'll see
85:01 you in the next deep thoughts over now
