00:00 [Music]
00:33 welcome back to D thoughts ladies and
00:35 gentlemen today's a beautiful day it's
00:40 about five o'clock it's sort of an early
00:44 summer day in spring which usually means
00:47 it gets cooler at night that's probably
00:49 the only big difference in California
00:50 between a real summer day that stays a
00:52 little warmer at night a little more
00:55 Breeze in the spring in California your
00:59 motorcycle is going by its HP for those
01:02 of you never been to Huntington Beach
01:03 California a lot of hot rods a lot of
01:09 you know Harley riding we got guys in
01:13 their 70s driving $350,000 57 Chevys
01:16 that they've redone with everything and
01:18 imaginable and then we have the young
01:20 kid driving by an Aventador but today I
01:24 thought we would discuss previous lifes
01:27 and to make sure you understand I'm
01:32 gonna come out this very lightly but
01:35 with some sort of epiphanies that have
01:39 started to sort of be undeniable in my
01:43 own life I recently like what four
01:44 episodes ago I said I don't have any
01:47 experiences or previous lifes and on one
01:51 level that's true and on another level
01:52 it's not completely true but it's one of
01:57 these things of we don't talk about that
02:00 I mean there's certain institutions
02:02 which rely on it heavily like
02:04 Scientology has a whole science behind
02:06 it whether or not you believe that or
02:09 not but I'm not a Scientologist I'm not
02:14 any religion as you guys know one of the
02:17 commenters made a beautiful comment and
02:19 I have to acknowledge him he said
02:22 because I've listened to about 200 euros
02:24 and he goes you always talk about how
02:26 you don't believe in Christ we get it so
02:29 I'm gonna definitely try to pull back
02:31 from that one I do want to make one
02:32 episode about the whole history of that
02:35 whole thing I've embedded it in several
02:38 episodes and Hodge podgy ways I think
02:40 it's
02:40 would be valuable to have it just being
02:43 episode all about that but that's not
02:45 going to be this episode so what do we
02:47 do in this world with a lack of true
02:51 research and knowledge and science in
02:53 areas in the mainstream education
02:56 there's there's always a good university
02:58 out there that does it foreign countries
03:01 outside the United States of America
03:02 have had the guts to research it at face
03:06 value it does suck when you start seeing
03:11 the military game where someone says
03:16 let's tell the Americans we have this
03:19 capability so they'll fear us and then
03:22 you get a lot of weird stuff you do you
03:24 get a lot of bizarre things that may or
03:28 may not be true you know remote viewing
03:29 I am still not convinced it works if
03:34 remote viewing works especially the way
03:36 that the trainer's say it works then
03:38 we're all just one class away from being
03:40 able to do it okay when someone in your
03:45 family you know go to the class get the
03:48 capability come back and say oh my god
03:50 this is the most amazing thing in the
03:51 world you should do it too and then of
03:53 course you'll do it because it's
03:54 validated you know you say okay I'm
03:57 gonna take a deck of cards into the next
03:59 room I'm gonna flip over one of the
04:01 cards and you just simply remote view
04:03 what the card is that doesn't happen and
04:09 so you know but I've seen all the
04:13 documentaries about all of them but I've
04:14 seen a ton of documentaries on it but he
04:17 might bought a course on it and so I did
04:22 an episode on it of course but with this
04:25 previous life thing it's very
04:26 interesting
04:28 my observable reality push to create
04:33 this episode has really occurred to me
04:36 probably in the last eight months and I
04:39 gave away just a little bit of it and
04:40 one of the episodes where I probably
04:42 sound like a crazy person this will
04:44 hopefully make it sound a little bit
04:46 more contextual
04:49 and this is gonna sound nuts but maybe
04:52 this is the way we all have to start
04:54 because there's no school behind it
04:56 there's absolutely no science behind it
04:58 I mean in proving that this actually
05:01 occurs it's easy for someone to
05:02 hallucinate a story and tell you that
05:07 that's who they were again in my
05:09 lifetime I have without exaggeration I
05:13 think the number is close to six like
05:15 half a dozen women have told me that
05:17 they were Nefertiti back in the day and
05:20 I'm sitting there going really geez get
05:23 in line man there's a ton of you trying
05:25 to be this perceived important female
05:28 one the funny thing that the soul
05:30 remains a gender bound entity mm-hmm not
05:34 sure I believe that for sure we all stay
05:36 men or we all stay women maybe we do
05:39 maybe the Y in the X chromosome is
05:41 related to our souls who knows but I
05:45 have had people tell me that they have
05:47 switched sexes as they go back and forth
05:49 I have a close friend of mine who has
05:51 done a tremendous amount of research in
05:54 this and absolutely wholeheartedly
05:55 believes they have tracked down at least
05:58 a few of their past lives and hate for
06:01 them it might be something that has been
06:06 always apparent since they were children
06:08 maybe I guess I'm a little more
06:11 skeptical if they go into an institution
06:13 and suddenly find out that this happened
06:15 when the institution is based on that
06:18 very belief because think about it if if
06:21 you are a human being that could recall
06:24 your previous life fairly accurately
06:25 like some of these little kids have done
06:28 and I believe those kids are legit man I
06:31 really do there's just no way that these
06:34 kids could do what they do without
06:37 having some real-life connection again I
06:39 believe in reincarnation for all the
06:42 reasons I noted in my reincarnation
06:43 episode basically what you need to know
06:47 about my belief is that you can't hide
06:49 energy in the universe and because you
06:53 can't the idea that you could die is
06:55 pretty ludicrous sure your flesh and
06:58 bone can go back to ashes and
07:00 become any number of things you know
07:04 some people are having their ashes
07:05 squished into little diamonds little
07:07 yellow urine colored diamonds little odd
07:10 that were our colors P maybe that's an
07:15 additive but the one I saw didn't say
07:18 you could be any color you wanted to so
07:21 here I go
07:24 one of the things that and this is going
07:27 to sound silly one of the things that
07:31 makes me teleport to another place
07:34 almost instantaneously is food really
07:42 strange when I lived in the Midwest and
07:46 of course I am eating hamburger steaks
07:50 I'm eating hotdogs and whatever and you
07:54 know barbecue this barbecue that chicken
07:57 steak ribs all that kind of stuff I grew
08:00 up in the explosion of produced food of
08:04 processed food excuse me
08:06 so there was a lot of manwich and all
08:09 that kind of you know white trash kind
08:10 of food you know the ingredients have
08:13 only gotten worse and worse over the
08:15 years so when I moved to California I
08:19 got a chance to eat a lot of different
08:21 cultures in the Midwest you pretty much
08:25 eat maybe there's an Asian restaurant
08:27 they'll be like an Italian restaurant
08:29 but it's made from Midwestern people so
08:31 it's really just not Italian you know I
08:34 lived in Massachusetts for two and a
08:35 half years I visited pizzerias by guys
08:39 from New York and so I was able to eat a
08:42 lot of very authentic stuff and you know
08:45 old mobster looking Italian restaurants
08:48 at times but when I eat Indian food my
08:54 first came out here and ate Indian food
08:55 I have to say the I don't know when I
09:00 first ate papadum I think I'm saying
09:03 that correct it's this it's this must be
09:07 like a batter and it has some like I
09:10 think it's oregano or something or other
09:13 in it
09:14 and they just pour it out on a on a hot
09:18 plate it turns hard like a cracker very
09:21 super thin fine cracker when I eat this
09:27 especially if I haven't had it for a
09:30 couple weeks I have an utter
09:34 teleportation of being in India and it
09:40 is really strange because it's extremely
09:43 powerful and it has taken hundreds of
09:47 times of having this happen to me eating
09:50 this in fact the restaurant that I go to
09:52 here in Southern California the guy used
09:55 to bring that all all the time because
09:57 he used to make it and keep it back
09:59 there heated up and now I don't think he
10:01 makes it unless you asked for it
10:03 and now it kind of comes out a little
10:05 oily because it's brand-new it's kind of
10:06 like a fresh tortilla chip you know has
10:09 a little bit of oil in it but the other
10:12 Indian food doesn't do it for me like
10:16 papadum and because the ingredient in
10:21 poppadom is and other cultures and other
10:23 foods and I'm not getting that
10:24 teleportation effect necessarily with
10:27 other foods I could do with this it's
10:30 starting to grow on me it's starting to
10:31 be a little strange I have never been to
10:33 India have I seen a fair number of
10:36 documentaries yeah I mean maybe in terms
10:40 of full-length 60-minute documentaries
10:42 maybe a dozen and a half my whole
10:44 lifetime so I don't know and you know I
10:47 haven't been riveted to them like oh my
10:49 god I've got to go there I mean I would
10:51 like to go there but more because the
10:54 papadum and not the the documentaries
11:00 when I am in these Indian restaurants a
11:02 lot of them play the Bollywood stuff on
11:04 the street host that Dali would be
11:06 interesting but they played Bollywood
11:10 stuff from the 5060 70s sometimes the
11:15 ultra-modern stuff and so my mind is
11:19 trying to parse this why is this
11:20 occurring I'm not a very impressionable
11:22 person I don't have I don't have a
11:27 the type of mind where someone comes up
11:29 to me and starts selling me Amway or
11:30 herbal life and all the sudden I see my
11:33 whole financial future solved and all
11:35 that kind of stuff
11:36 I'm extremely cynical about that kind of
11:38 stuff and yet this has an a profound
11:42 effect on me
11:43 technically what happens is I put in my
11:46 mouth and I eat it I'm chewing it up as
11:49 soon as that those flavors start to hit
11:50 me it is if my visual forum is replaced
11:56 by pretty much the same exact vision of
12:00 the same exact village it feels back in
12:05 time but not like Stone Age I don't know
12:09 there's no indicators and I have not
12:11 enough knowledge of India to know what
12:13 decade that what it might that it might
12:14 be I'm not seeing cars I see a kid
12:19 that's the other weird thing I see this
12:21 kid walking by me and there's a house to
12:24 the right it's pretty much it's pretty
12:26 dusty place kind of a tan to wean look
12:30 to it and if I'm right the kid is sort
12:34 of swatting a brush earning more than
12:39 anything a cow in front of him now I
12:41 know from from just light research that
12:45 they in some areas of India worship the
12:47 cow I do know that but you have to
12:51 understand I haven't fixated on that
12:52 much so I wonder does this have
12:57 something to do with a real event a real
13:00 past of mine where I am going back where
13:03 this trigger of because the thing is is
13:08 if you break it down technically
13:09 speaking this is what we have to
13:10 understand and those of you who ladies
13:14 who've had kids and and we have we all
13:17 have what I'm about to describe but
13:19 there's some profound version of this
13:22 for pregnant women where you will eat
13:25 something and it absolutely takes you
13:27 back to your childhood again we all have
13:31 this I have smells and tastes from the
13:35 70s that will nail me like eating a Fig
13:37 Newton
13:38 his pure 70s for me men I don't know
13:41 what it is it's just but that makes
13:44 sense to me I have a lot of imprinting
13:45 in my mind from back in those days but
13:47 let's break down this pump it down for
13:49 one second here because we're trying to
13:51 get to a science that we might make a
13:52 little bit of sense and not just be some
13:55 hallucination of mine and it could be
13:57 who knows it's unbelievably profoundly
14:00 identical and it happens a hundred
14:05 percent at the time what happens when we
14:08 eat something we have our taste our
14:13 smell that creates a flavor the third
14:15 dimension of those two but everything is
14:18 being translated into electrical signals
14:20 and sent back to the brain to process
14:21 the reality that is the sense of taste
14:25 smell and touch those three things
14:29 cascading back over your brain
14:32 potentially of your pine Yolen and
14:34 potentially out to the universe as a
14:36 query might be returning a result that
14:42 is your previous life or someone else's
14:47 life if we have if we are truly the same
14:50 being there's only one soul in the
14:52 entire universe which is the easiest way
14:55 to achieve infinity a single object that
14:58 can appear in all space and time do you
15:00 have infinity in all regards how many of
15:02 you are there infinite there's another
15:08 issue when it comes to history have you
15:13 ever I mean you know think about it
15:17 you were born in a particular decade I
15:19 think most of people alive today
15:21 probably don't go back much further than
15:23 the 30s and anyone older than that is
15:27 probably not watching this show but you
15:32 have that part of the history of your
15:34 geographical location the years that you
15:36 were born you have that empirical
15:39 knowledge it is your life you were there
15:41 to the degree can remember it there you
15:44 go that's how much lucidity you have for
15:47 your own memory of history and then we
15:50 have been inundated by
15:52 tons of movies tons of television
15:54 History Channel stuff period piece
15:58 movies if you're a big reader you can
16:02 read potentially back seven thousand
16:08 years you know and again depending on
16:12 the actual age of Babylonia and the
16:14 Egyptians you might be reading parables
16:18 that are a hundred thousand years old
16:20 you never know the prodigal son like I
16:21 said is an Egyptian hieroglyph so you're
16:25 you're hearing the echos of previous man
16:28 as a mankind going back millennia but
16:34 times a hundred sometimes potentially
16:38 and so we have archetypes in the
16:43 hundreds of thousands if not millions
16:45 inside our brains meaning story patterns
16:48 that are over you know told over and
16:50 over and over that big question and I
16:54 don't I haven't released the episode yet
16:56 get that out before I get this one out
16:57 of essentially who are we you know
17:03 there's the question of who you are in
17:05 the immediate presence which is usually
17:07 noted by a couple generations over who
17:10 you are feeding into the immediate
17:13 memorable rules that your family might
17:17 pass down to you or you might inherit
17:19 through just listening to conversations
17:20 or knowing about the history of your
17:22 family but then it becomes that sort of
17:25 mystery of like damnit I really I really
17:28 want to know what my relatives were like
17:30 further and further and further back and
17:32 and you know I've got some friends and
17:34 do my relatives know their relatives
17:36 chances are if you're the same race and
17:39 you come from the same area of the world
17:41 yeah they probably did believe it or not
17:44 and it's probably not even a
17:45 mathematical mystery that when you take
17:48 10,000 people from Africa and you start
17:52 going back and back and back and back
17:54 you're starting to condense the
17:56 population tremendously of the 10,000
17:58 you might get down to a hundred and then
18:00 you split it up
18:01 you know geographically over whatever
18:02 area they came from and they're gonna
18:04 know each other
18:05 the same thing for us Europeans and
18:07 Asian's and all the other races Latin
18:10 folks down down south but the other
18:14 thing that I have discovered which is
18:16 really odd for me is that you know for
18:19 those of you who are hardcore listeners
18:21 viewers and you have delve delved into
18:25 my dream series I've talked a lot about
18:28 how I study my dreams and I have been
18:30 studying them like crazy I've been
18:32 having some serious epiphanies about at
18:37 least the way I dream and so the the
18:40 areas in which I dream the physical
18:42 locations which are obviously all made
18:44 up I think you know I'm not traveling
18:47 the world in my dreams I'm not finding
18:49 myself in India or Russia or Asia I'm
18:52 always in some sort of bizarre hybrid of
18:57 current reality so for me I'm not seeing
19:01 any necessarily older places I've been
19:07 in my dreams except a select few but
19:13 what's interesting about the Select view
19:15 is that they are very realistic and very
19:18 different than my other dreams and I
19:21 don't know if I just drink that you know
19:23 the right amount of water took the right
19:25 medicine before I went to bed I don't
19:26 know what the deal is you know I took
19:27 the right sea b-17 before I went to bed
19:30 or something like that there was a dream
19:33 that I shared a long time ago where I
19:35 woke up in this kitchen it was like a
19:38 50s kitchen
19:39 it was very blue it's like a baby blue
19:44 color I haven't asked you my parents if
19:46 this place exists I should but my
19:49 grandmother on my father's side was in
19:51 there and she was one of the closest
19:52 people in my entire life she just got me
19:55 on a level that to this day is I feel
19:59 very privileged that we had this
20:02 connection and she has passed since 1993
20:06 so Harry I'm seeing her it was probably
20:08 10 years ago in my dream and so she was
20:13 there and I was like oh my god it's my
20:15 grandmother you know and she was so
20:17 realistic it was it was much different
20:19 than
20:20 almost all my dreams and I told her I
20:22 said look what are you doing here
20:24 grandma and I realized all sudden my
20:26 voice is a tiny voice I was like a
20:29 little kid now the voice sounded like it
20:32 was probably between four and six
20:34 somewhere in there and I said you know I
20:39 can't remember what she said back to me
20:42 but I told her I said I give this
20:44 gigantic hug and I'm hugging her like it
20:48 would be like her standing in this patio
20:50 right now and I'm hugging her and I'm
20:53 telling her I said grandma you're you're
20:55 not in my world anymore
20:57 and I I'm kind of crying a little bit
21:01 you know but I'm not crying such that I
21:03 can hear my cry I'm just feeling it I'm
21:05 feeling that cry feeling of like damn I
21:09 get to hug her one more time now my
21:12 belief system she's around me whenever
21:14 she wants to be around me she can
21:16 influence me whenever she wants to
21:17 influence me that's what I call my
21:19 intuition I think those that are passed
21:21 live in the intuition that's what it is
21:23 why do females have more intuition on
21:25 average than males because females are
21:27 more plugged in to the right brain of
21:29 the universe and the spirituality and
21:31 the nurturing of life itself and so of
21:36 course females pick up on that that
21:38 frequency and I would suggest any of you
21:41 that are mourning over a loved one being
21:43 passed I want you to remember what I
21:47 said okay because this is my opinion but
21:49 I will tell you that if you embrace this
21:53 opinion you're opening a door for them
21:56 to come through if you don't have this
21:58 opinion then you're keeping the door
21:59 closed because of perhaps in my opinion
22:02 naivete and you're shutting off a
22:04 beautiful communication with those who
22:06 pass imagine you're on the other side
22:10 and I mean there's been a hundred movies
22:14 that portrayed this I think one was
22:17 called always with Richard Dreyfuss
22:21 wasn't him he was a pilot that would fly
22:24 over it's a fictional character but he
22:26 would fly over forest fires and dump
22:29 that goo on the fire and he died in one
22:32 of his runs
22:33 but he was engaged to this woman of his
22:36 dreams and so he comes back into her
22:38 life because he doesn't want to leave
22:40 and she does it falling in love with
22:43 another guy and he's watching the whole
22:44 thing happen but he's trying to talk to
22:47 her he's trying to I think he's trying
22:51 to become reborn somehow he's trying to
22:54 figure out how to do this but I believe
22:57 that if you shut them off if you think
22:59 that they're truly gone and if you're
23:00 good with that and that's fine if you're
23:02 totally good with that and some people
23:03 you don't you don't want to have any
23:04 communication with they were a bad
23:06 relative a bad friend and fine cut them
23:09 off if you're struggling with that loss
23:13 of someone keep your spirit open keep
23:16 your your antenna open to feel perhaps
23:21 their contribution to your life but I
23:25 will throughout a particular day if I'm
23:29 listening to old music that's that's
23:31 another huge one I have visions of the
23:34 70s of being in places that I don't know
23:37 if I've really ever been my parents took
23:39 me all over the place when I was a kid I
23:41 mean they were pretty active traveling
23:44 and within the United States I mean they
23:46 did a lot of European traveling that I
23:48 got to do but I don't remember any of it
23:50 right but it's almost as if I have
23:54 epiphanies of the past and the present
23:56 all at the same time sometimes probably
23:58 the future a little bit more than the
24:01 past traveling in a particular area in
24:04 the world like I this is what I said in
24:06 the previous episode like if I'm
24:07 traveling in Los Angeles for instance
24:10 I'm just driving around for a meeting or
24:12 something and I'll start looking at you
24:14 know various intersections sometimes the
24:17 triggers more at night sometimes it
24:19 actually triggers more at dusk I don't
24:22 know I think most of my dreams are at
24:24 dusk a lot of them I've had very few
24:28 bright daytime dreams but I have
24:29 actually had them I wasn't sure I was
24:31 having them until I remembered one where
24:33 I was in a house that was seemingly in
24:37 in India to be honest and it was next to
24:42 a body of water and the house was sort
24:45 of old and it was made of
24:47 at some point had some stucco on and
24:50 some white stucco and I remember it had
24:52 this beautiful view out to the beach and
24:55 a wave about ten feet tall just gently
24:59 washed into the house and of course it
25:02 was a bad thing because it was very
25:04 heavy and destructive and we're all
25:06 trying to we're trying to like sensibly
25:08 get to cover we're not terribly
25:09 panicking but we're like oh geez
25:11 we gotta get out of here but I'll be
25:14 looking at a corner in Los Angeles
25:17 there's Sam stuck at an intersection and
25:18 there's like some big t-joint thing
25:20 going on and there might be like a diner
25:22 or something in front of me very
25:24 modern-day diner maybe it's 20 to 50
25:28 years old something like that the pans
25:30 and or something like that and I'll be
25:32 looking at it and all of a sudden my
25:34 mind does a full overlay of what this
25:37 will look like 50 years from now maybe
25:41 75 years from now it's not flying cars
25:44 or that kind of stuff but what ends up
25:48 happening in my vision is that it looks
25:52 like we have really done ourselves a
25:54 solid like we figured stuff out the
25:57 architecture is a bizarre mix of sort of
26:00 a Art Deco atomic era futuristic look
26:05 not terrible not like I mean not
26:07 terribly advanced to the point where you
26:09 feel like I'm in a different world which
26:10 is why I won't go much further than 50
26:12 years I don't see car models but I
26:16 definitely see vehicles traveling in the
26:18 area and it seems like the other thing
26:22 that ends up happening when this little
26:24 vision occurs and it kurz all over the
26:26 place I'll be driving down the highway
26:27 on the 405 in Orange County and this
26:30 happens in the highway like the what
26:33 ends up happening is the highway gets
26:34 really manicured the the landscaping
26:37 gets really amazing and it's just in my
26:40 mind's eye it's just like this little
26:41 overlay that happens it's very strange
26:44 but the immediate feeling I get and I
26:48 have this all over LA I don't know what
26:49 the deal is with LA it's like I'm gonna
26:52 be the caretaker of this joint out of
26:54 the Overlook Hotel you know without
26:56 chopping my friends up and little pieces
26:58 go see The Shining if you're real
27:01 from that comment mm-hmm but it's always
27:05 a very peaceful sort of it would be the
27:10 feeling you might get about a week after
27:12 you win the lottery if you calm down
27:14 through your foreo phase or your
27:16 surprise phase and you're just like oh
27:18 my god now I could finally do what I
27:20 want to do with my life or whatever your
27:22 your epiphany might be and so the reason
27:28 why I want to make this episode is that
27:30 I feel like these have collected enough
27:34 inside of me that I'm now skeptical of
27:38 what the hell this really is is it you
27:41 know everyone's talked about daydreaming
27:42 but daydreaming when you're a kid you
27:46 know I mean it's like anything you could
27:48 daydream about being a rock star your
27:50 daydream about whatever being in a
27:52 spaceship you know what it's gotta be
27:54 something sort of out of this world
27:56 because otherwise people won't
27:57 necessarily call it daydreaming you're
27:59 just thinking if you're thinking about
28:01 well should I do my homework should I
28:02 apply for that job that's really sort of
28:05 just thinking daydreaming is where it
28:07 goes sort of sci-fi a little bit doesn't
28:09 it I guess one of the just as a little
28:14 small digression on daydreaming
28:17 my mom's era and she had this - I don't
28:22 think she's ever really talked to anyone
28:23 else but I have and I've heard this be a
28:27 very common thing for people born in the
28:29 40s little girls would if they reached
28:34 that sort of point where there's a
28:36 little bit of resistance between their
28:38 parents and themselves you know they
28:41 don't want to follow the rules they
28:42 maybe they do follow the rules but they
28:44 don't want to they had this this
28:47 daydream of being rescued by this royal
28:52 family and that they were actually a
28:53 princess and they're gonna be pulled out
28:56 of that world you know which is all
28:57 those fairy tales that we hear you know
28:59 it's probably it's probably such a such
29:06 an old archetype created by monarchies I
29:09 mean think about it what if what if
29:11 America had a
29:12 an insane monarchy which is any monarchy
29:15 running our country you know pretending
29:18 to not have any power of course which is
29:20 such a joke it would be pretty common
29:22 for a kid to think well maybe I'm a
29:24 prince maybe I'm a princess or whatever
29:26 and you run off and you have a better
29:29 life it's just like it's the old lottery
29:31 ticket model of course now princess has
29:36 a completely different meaning in 2019
29:39 then there's the question of linear time
29:43 so I have had people friends of mine
29:47 tell me that they remember the future
29:49 lives that they're gonna have to me that
29:53 that makes a lot of sense as being a
29:56 potential could happen thing and again
29:59 if you really you know unfortunately we
30:03 have to adopt paradigms to structure our
30:06 thoughts don't we how was life occurring
30:11 to you well I woke up earlier today and
30:14 then I went out and had some lunch and I
30:16 came back and I worked about 15 feet
30:18 from here in the Sun and then I decided
30:21 to go and do an episode came back 15
30:24 feet this way and time is passing as I
30:27 am experiencing my day what is time well
30:30 it's an illusion created by the fact
30:32 that my mind can recall previous events
30:35 previous states of the universe states
30:37 of my being I was hungry that I ate and
30:39 I was full I'm still pretty full I smell
30:44 nice and flowery than I smoked a cigar
30:46 for us we're stuck in perceivably linear
30:49 time I don't know how to get back to my
30:52 morning it'd be awesome if I could I get
30:55 a lot more episodes done if I could do
30:57 that but once outside of the three
31:01 dimensional $0.05 body and understand
31:03 there's more senses than that but let's
31:05 just go with that for now I might be
31:08 able to be in two places at the same
31:09 time two XY T's if that's the case then
31:15 chase there's no limitation as to who I
31:18 could be and where I could be it but let
31:22 me throw at you a little monkey wrench
31:24 in this notion of
31:26 our previous lives and I've had one
31:31 friend of mine tell me that even this
31:33 isn't a limitation for them in almost
31:37 all the cases I only have one friend and
31:39 I'm sure there's thousands of people
31:41 that that have this other thing so I'm
31:42 not trying to be naive here the previous
31:46 lifes are usually earthbound life's I
31:49 personally I've only had a couple dreams
31:53 in my entire lifetime where I really
31:55 felt like one one of them was absolutely
31:58 certain to be on a different planet and
32:00 I was just flying in on a ship and
32:04 potentially I was by myself and the
32:08 level of detail in this dream was
32:11 astonishing and I mean wow I was flying
32:16 into a planet that had these told us
32:19 once before but it had these bamboo like
32:22 trees except instead of being a single
32:25 bamboo coming up from the from the
32:28 ground it was like I don't know maybe 30
32:32 40 of these things and they must have
32:34 been the cross-section on one of these
32:36 bamboo things must have been I don't
32:40 know could have been almost a football
32:43 field across and very green and they
32:46 didn't have the little slats that you
32:48 see up the up normal piece of wood like
32:54 that so if it's all green and they were
32:56 all kind of clustered together coming up
32:57 to make the trunk of a tree and there
33:00 was they were they were sharing the
33:02 ground down below and so down below it
33:04 turns and goes flat to the ground and
33:08 I'm coming in on a ship and I have got
33:10 clouds just above my ship but they were
33:12 kind of sparse so it was a good day but
33:15 it was cold as hell and I remember the
33:16 glass in my ship was sort of frosted
33:20 over the condensation between my breath
33:22 against the glass and the coldness
33:24 outside and I'm I'm not controlling the
33:27 ship it seemed to be doing its own thing
33:28 and I must be geez I would say 10,000
33:34 feet up or more and I'm looking down at
33:36 these gigantic things it's a whole new
33:38 world and there was more
33:39 fog down at the very bottom so I
33:41 couldn't really see absolutely the floor
33:44 of this planet that was kind of kind of
33:46 like you could see between the clouds a
33:48 little bit so it wasn't like totally
33:49 100% covered up the lighting was
33:53 unbelievably realistic
33:55 it was definitely had a bright Sun and
33:57 it was it was like a sunny morning
33:59 coming into this misty covered planet of
34:02 these gigantic tree clusters of bamboo
34:07 very interesting so aside from those
34:11 types of dreams
34:12 most people always remember being a
34:15 human on earth and you know it's
34:20 interesting when schizophrenia kicks in
34:22 people want to be very famous people you
34:24 know for some reason in a particular era
34:28 people want to be Winston Churchill
34:30 it's the joke and of course Hollywood is
34:32 romanticized that up a little bit but
34:35 it's truthful
34:36 I mean people multiple people in the
34:38 world at times have one to be Winston
34:40 Churchill and you can only imagine that
34:41 what they're doing is they're seeing
34:42 Winston Churchill in the romanticized
34:45 revised history being the most one of
34:50 the most profound leaders of world war
34:51 ii / england now it's kind of coming out
34:54 he was sort of just a very moral man
34:56 with all of his aches and pains and
34:59 pluses and minuses that we all have but
35:03 why do all those females keep telling me
35:04 they're Cleopatra that means that
35:06 Cleopatra probably Cleopatra - but
35:09 Nefertiti when effort titties bust as we
35:12 have romanticize to us a beautiful woman
35:17 she was so beautiful she commanded the
35:21 attention of the Pharaohs hmm if you had
35:24 to pick want to go for the gusto in the
35:28 movie altered states they surfaced the
35:30 fact that a lot of people become when
35:34 they get into pretty developed levels of
35:37 schizophrenia they will have had no
35:39 history of being Christian but they will
35:42 believe that they are Christ David Icke
35:47 went through a phase where he thought he
35:49 was Christ and I think in 1989 I read
35:50 that famous interview he had
35:53 okay so something's happening where
35:55 people I mean that's a heavy thing
35:57 you're talking about being the Son of
35:59 God if you're a male but a lot of people
36:03 have schizophrenia they're not from my
36:05 brief research into that over the years
36:08 they're not saying they're gonna
36:10 necessarily save the world and bring the
36:13 second coming and all this good stuff
36:15 there just simply feeling like that's
36:18 who they are
36:21 it may just simply be a state of
36:24 euphoria I don't know what are the some
36:27 of the techniques that go backwards
36:29 probably the most widely accepted
36:31 methodology if you're into this sort of
36:33 thing is to do hypnosis you're
36:36 hypnotized and if you think about it the
36:42 many of you are familiar with Twilight
36:45 Zone the show on TV that brought Serling
36:47 created the twilight zone is the zone
36:51 where you are between a conscious state
36:54 and an unconscious state that is what it
36:56 is that's why he says he lives in the
36:58 mezzanine between the two and anything
37:01 can happen because you're partly in a
37:03 dream world and you're partly in a
37:06 quote-unquote real world so as you were
37:09 hypnotized you were literally being
37:12 placed into the twilight zone now they
37:16 used to tell you that when when I was a
37:17 kid
37:18 hypnosis is really it only works on
37:22 those who want to be hypnotized those
37:24 who need something to occur to make them
37:27 feel special if you talk to people who
37:32 are professional hypnotists and their
37:34 level with you they'll tell you yeah you
37:36 know most of it is just someone doing
37:40 what they want to do and because they're
37:42 in the envelope of hypnotism when it
37:45 occurs especially those public guys you
37:47 bring a bunch of people together and you
37:50 know the most brilliant one is they make
37:51 two people talk to each other in Martian
37:52 talk that's one of my most coveted
37:56 experiences watching that whole thing
37:58 but they've always wanted to do
38:00 something that they wouldn't normally do
38:02 and because they can blame it on the
38:04 hypnotism they just go for it
38:08 they have those key words those trigger
38:10 words well you're gonna touch your nose
38:12 every time I say pop and then they do it
38:16 I've heard one guy say that they'll
38:19 follow it to the tee because they don't
38:21 want to they think that not doing it
38:22 makes them broken that everyone should
38:25 be able to be hypnotized and so you're
38:27 gonna follow through on the commands not
38:30 because it's really making you do it but
38:31 because it makes you correct and right
38:35 now we know that hypnotism is a very
38:38 dangerous place to go because the
38:41 hypnotist can suggest things to you and
38:44 sort of guide you along the way the
38:48 other thing about recalling a previous
38:50 life is it's tough I just told you my
38:54 story about eating papadum and and
38:56 having these this actually this
38:58 reoccurring flash to something that
39:02 looks like India the kid in front of me
39:04 is definitely from India he's got the
39:07 skin colour he's got the genetics so I
39:11 don't have any sense of my body when it
39:13 occurs I don't look down and find myself
39:15 an old man I don't have any inclination
39:19 of Who I am personally but now what
39:23 would be the if we're trying to take it
39:26 one step into the scientific realm how
39:28 do we verify that what we're talking
39:30 about is real or fake how do we do it
39:34 we're simply seeing something okay
39:39 well the reason why I did a little bit
39:42 of diversion into the dreamworld before
39:44 getting to this last seconds half of
39:46 this thing as we know we dream if you do
39:50 dream certain doctors say we all dream
39:54 and some of us don't remember it I could
39:57 believe that but it's almost like one of
39:59 these
40:00 was it Confucius or whatever you know if
40:03 the tree falls and no one's there to
40:05 hear it does it make any sound if you
40:07 dream and you don't remember it doesn't
40:08 really have a profound effect on you
40:10 maybe maybe done so if someone were to
40:13 be hypnotized and they're in this
40:16 beautiful freeform
40:19 moment of consciousness then they could
40:21 simply be you know pulling something
40:26 together as a tapestry of all their
40:27 previous experiences or even hearsay
40:30 experiences I heard someone did this I
40:32 read the book Troy and so now I'm gonna
40:34 think I'm Troy I've heard I've seen
40:37 Nefertiti's bust and she's so beautiful
40:38 and it's so enchanting and it's such a
40:41 mystery but I'm gonna gravitate to being
40:43 her you know I'm sure it's happened but
40:47 I don't here I've never had a personal
40:49 friend of mine say oh yeah man I was Ted
40:51 Bundy I was Jack the Ripper
40:54 I was Hitler you don't hear anybody
40:56 really calling up those those people as
41:00 their targets it's always something
41:02 enchanting rewarding in most cases now
41:06 people who are chronic studiers of this
41:09 they who believe that they have previous
41:11 lives I definitely have heard folks
41:15 talking about life's that were built out
41:20 of sheer misery and they they tend to
41:25 create recreate original sin in a way
41:28 because they'll take on a bit of Karma
41:31 but of the I can't remember which one
41:34 believes it but there's one form of
41:35 Karma that says that if you mess up your
41:37 children and you and your family are
41:40 punished for seven generations well that
41:43 sucks you have nothing to do with that I
41:46 mean again if God wouldn't do it then it
41:50 probably doesn't exist and why would God
41:52 do that to your kids of all things right
41:55 you're an [ __ ] and so your kids are
41:57 gonna be suffering give me a break
41:59 that's just asinine thinking but it is
42:02 definitely something to motivate man to
42:04 behave because what you want your kids
42:07 to go through that hell no well then
42:08 behave okay why is the fire and
42:13 brimstone thrown at us and Christianity
42:15 and a bunch of other religions because
42:17 they want you to behave it gets rid of
42:20 law of the jungle and technically
42:22 speaking we need those things we do you
42:27 know the secular atheists of the world
42:29 started eugenics about 1900 in a very
42:32 formal man
42:33 again Planned Parenthood before was
42:37 called Planned Parenthood was a eugenics
42:39 organization and so their methodology
42:42 was to simply say if you're an
42:44 undesirable based on the I guess the the
42:48 elite definition of normality they'd
42:51 simply sterilize you female or male then
42:55 your gene pool doesn't go any further
42:57 and they just they just go on with their
42:59 life at least you're eliminated out of
43:01 the gene pool so instead of law of the
43:05 jungle where someone's caving
43:08 everybody's heads in he misbehave
43:10 cutting the heads off or whatever I just
43:12 make sure you can't procreate but the
43:16 previous life thought process where
43:20 you're carrying forward previous life
43:24 ailments you know I think that a lot of
43:28 us that go through life and you
43:31 philosophize as to what the hell we are
43:32 on this planet you know the soul the
43:36 soul is continuing to being reincarnated
43:38 and what-have-you
43:40 you might well that's funny because I I
43:44 made an episode that said is this heaven
43:46 and a lot of you said no this is hell
43:53 okay probably if you feel that way your
43:59 vision of what you should be
44:01 experiencing is drastically different
44:02 than what you actually are experiencing
44:04 maybe you're on the valley you know and
44:07 you've got to get up on that hill the
44:09 peak but someone could have typed in
44:12 that kind of comment and the very next
44:14 day met the most amazing person in in
44:16 their life that they're unbelievably
44:18 compatible with and they're in heaven
44:23 never to be alone again never to be
44:26 marginalized by another human being they
44:29 are celebrated for everything that they
44:30 love and so their opinion changes we
44:35 have children that are born that take
44:37 their families to nearby villages nearby
44:40 towns sometimes a little bit further
44:42 away but usually not that far away
44:43 that's the weird thing
44:44 and they'll say yeah
44:46 live here and that family does this and
44:49 that and this and that and they'll get
44:50 about 80% of it right
44:52 you're cynic will say well they got 20%
44:55 wrong it's like anything over 21% is
45:00 starting to see is starting to prove a
45:02 clairvoyant capability of seeing
45:05 whatever they're talking about
45:07 meaningful randomness is about 21% if I
45:11 held up a deck of cards and I said tell
45:13 me what suit this is you know you're
45:15 gonna get 21% correct if you have no
45:17 clairvoyance whatsoever if you have an
45:20 ability to read my mind then you're
45:22 gonna get over 21% and I got that from
45:25 the Stanford center that was testing
45:29 children for psychic abilities and they
45:32 said look when kids are born they're
45:35 like 45% as they get older they lose
45:38 that capability by 4 or 5 years old
45:41 they're done by 8 they're fully clean
45:43 and it's always been my belief since I
45:48 heard that that this is what children
45:50 need to survive they have to be psychic
45:53 when they're born because they have the
45:55 inability to communicate and so they're
45:58 gonna have to read your soul to feel
46:01 loved and feel belonging but now what if
46:06 you ride that kid on the very minimum
46:10 this is a bit of a digression but we'll
46:12 move around here what if the kid got
46:15 just the bare-bones minimum love minimum
46:18 nutrition shelter whatever to survive
46:22 but they live in that crib in a
46:24 completely sort of independent way
46:28 instead of a communal world they live in
46:30 sort of a sterile solo world and maybe
46:36 they've grow up to be a little messed up
46:38 maybe they're not messed up maybe
46:40 they're all unbelievably independent you
46:43 know my father had a rule very quickly
46:46 after I came home from the hospital if I
46:47 cried in my crib he wouldn't let my mom
46:50 coming in and hold me because he said
46:53 he's got to learn he's got to learn one
46:56 he can't manipulate us but two
46:59 this is the way the world is no one's
47:01 gonna come and hug ya just cuz you cry
47:03 and I think that that had a profound
47:06 effect on my ability to be a very strong
47:09 person just a suspicion can't prove it
47:13 what other evidence do we have of life
47:16 before this one previous lives well
47:21 oddly and I cannot remember the names
47:25 and the places for this but I think a
47:26 lot of you have heard heard about this
47:28 when they would do organ transplants
47:31 well they still do them right when they
47:33 do organ transplants on people some
47:34 people claim to have gained the skillset
47:38 of the other person usually art is the
47:42 way this is most realized and someone
47:45 didn't have any art capability
47:46 whatsoever they got some sort of liver
47:49 transplant heart transplant I think it's
47:51 more typical with heart transplants but
47:53 all of a sudden the person has the
47:55 capability of drawing as they're
47:57 recovering in the hospital they start
47:58 cranking out drawings in one particular
48:01 case and again who knows if this is real
48:05 because it's television
48:06 you know producers will go for anything
48:08 to make their so amazing Here I am
48:10 repeating it but they showed a drawing
48:13 that someone created in a hospital and
48:17 they were they were an adult and they
48:18 were given a child's organ and they drew
48:24 a drawing and the contributor the the
48:27 parent of this child who oversaw of a
48:31 donation of the organs saw the drawing
48:34 and said my God my child made that same
48:37 drawing and they put them you know
48:39 together and it wasn't identical
48:42 identical but geez it was like 90% the
48:46 same thing and so no scientists might
48:50 just simply say yeah well there's
48:52 genetic markers or what have you there's
48:55 something else going on but if you think
48:56 about it if you go with the singularity
49:00 project the kurtzweil project where
49:03 we're just a bag of chemicals eventually
49:05 we'll be able to download our
49:06 consciousness into a computer it doesn't
49:10 account for a heart
49:12 or any other organ in the body besides
49:14 the brain itself being able to carry the
49:16 chemical configuration that is memory
49:20 however if a particular organ is driven
49:24 by not just an electrical matrix in the
49:27 brain and your nervous system throughout
49:29 your body but that that organ has to
49:32 have a connection to a soul remember
49:36 when you procreate when the sperm
49:39 pierces the egg there's the division and
49:41 then very quickly there's that little
49:43 heartbeat but boom boom boom it's like
49:46 but dump it dump it dump it dump it
49:47 don't write well the heart is most
49:52 definitely the point when scientists
49:53 except for Democrats of course say that
49:56 you actually have life and if you
50:00 extinguish that heartbeat you are
50:02 killing a life and thankfully for the
50:06 Democrats there's no proof of a soul and
50:08 so they can just kill off kids at nine
50:11 months right
50:12 you'd have a soul - you're out of your
50:14 mother's womb that little tidbit if it
50:18 is true the people gain these things
50:20 from transplants of course there's a
50:23 bunch of horror movies where you know an
50:25 arm gets transplanted and it's trying to
50:27 strangle the guy that gets hit and you
50:28 trying to kill everybody I'm talking
50:30 about that one although kind of freaky
50:32 right
50:33 don't want to get a heart from some
50:35 serial killer
50:36 it ebbs towards the soul and once you
50:41 have the construct of a soul in your
50:43 scientific tackle box toolbox then you
50:49 will have the platform that you need to
50:52 really discuss a life before this one
50:56 and a life after this one now here's the
50:59 big question I have for anyone in this
51:01 realm especially those who are developed
51:04 believers of such things do you really
51:09 want to stack up every previous life
51:10 into this one I would say well maybe if
51:17 everything you've been previous to this
51:20 life has been congruent with the one
51:22 you're trying to live right now perhaps
51:24 meaning
51:26 you're a theoretical physicist who
51:29 believes in ether you're trying to parse
51:32 whether this is flat around every what
51:35 stars are where we are all that kind of
51:37 stuff and in your previous 20 lives you
51:41 have been the same exact scientists
51:44 doesn't matter if you're male or female
51:46 you're pushing that genetic thought
51:49 forward your soul has refined sequel
51:56 queries to go out and find that data in
51:59 the universe and obviously the universe
52:01 knows the answer to all that it exists
52:05 therefore it is perfect so maybe you
52:08 want to carry that for it because it's
52:09 standing on your own shoulders you
52:13 probably have a lot of friends from
52:15 those previous life's maybe you have a
52:17 little Oppenheimer buddy or maybe you're
52:19 friends with Tesla at home and volton
52:21 and Faraday and all those guys and all
52:24 the ones that are unnamed that
52:25 participated Madame Curie all these
52:27 brilliant people it's a little sub-game
52:30 to this crazy thing we call living and
52:34 being in this form of a body my
52:38 suspicion is this about life even though
52:41 it is extremely precious and one
52:45 shouldn't toy with it terribly but what
52:51 if it was sort of in the bigger picture
52:54 what if it's like well you know do it do
52:58 what you want really we have rules
53:00 because people you shouldn't be
53:02 interfering with someone else's game if
53:04 someone's trying to play the long game
53:05 you shouldn't hurt them or do them harm
53:08 because you're messing with someone
53:10 else's solving right it'd be it's almost
53:12 like this okay so take West world the
53:15 show on HBO where humans come into a
53:17 Western world and they're you know what
53:21 are they in the 1870s or so right and
53:23 they're allowed to kill the hosts and
53:26 you know rape and pillage and do
53:27 whatever they want go on treasure hunts
53:29 have a good time but you're not allowed
53:31 to mess up another guests run
53:35 you're not allowed to go over and push a
53:38 guy off a cliff I mean that could happen
53:40 in that world right people should be
53:41 dying in West Village out of sheer
53:42 accidents but you're not allowed to do
53:46 that because that's their sovereign
53:47 space but you can do whatever you want
53:51 with your life pierce yourself up tattoo
53:54 yourself up be a loser being amazing
53:59 whatever it's up to you men we don't
54:03 like to think about it being like that
54:04 do we again those who grow up to be
54:06 sociopaths because they've been treated
54:08 poorly by society often reach that point
54:11 of who cares you know some folks you
54:16 know I put it this way we have a
54:17 definite definition of what a human
54:20 being is supposed to look like in this
54:22 world depending on where you are in the
54:24 world depending what race you are
54:26 culture you're in but within those
54:28 condos constraints you're supposed to be
54:30 a certain way it's just the norm X
54:34 amount of productivity but when someone
54:37 is abused by fellow citizens of that
54:41 particular area or if they happen to
54:43 move away and get it you know bad
54:45 treatment from someplace else it doesn't
54:47 matter they get to a point of futility
54:49 they mutilate themselves some of them
54:53 horrendously bad because they're kind of
54:57 at a point where their life has turned
54:59 into a pointless exercise at that
55:02 current state of their life that current
55:04 stage that year that month that day
55:05 they're thinking why why why even
55:08 continue everything I try doesn't work
55:10 what if they could be lay down on a sofa
55:13 regressed and find out that the life
55:16 they were just prior to that life was
55:20 amazing and someone might suggest well
55:25 you know what that's not just a picture
55:28 of your past that is a picture of your
55:30 soul in the past and guess what you
55:34 still got access to that soul it is you
55:37 is so you it's more you than your body
55:40 is you so don't lose hope you come from
55:45 a long line of doers
55:47 now for whatever reason the parents that
55:50 you got the friends that you've got the
55:52 life that you got maybe all those other
55:53 things are great but you just stumbled
55:55 around the wrong way the economy is
55:57 shitty and so you maybe get back on
56:03 track with just that notion but what if
56:06 we were trying to prove this in a
56:07 laboratory the hell would we do well
56:11 what's really strange is these little
56:13 kids that seem to get a tremendous
56:15 amount of stuff correct about where they
56:17 lived in the previous life well
56:19 technically speaking if we were
56:21 scientists that weren't trying to again
56:23 control knowledge because it gives too
56:27 much power to the people we would have
56:30 probably already acknowledged in a
56:32 scientific realm in schools and colleges
56:34 and books that weren't in New Age
56:37 sections but in academic sections that
56:39 this really does occur but it's very
56:41 rare in a way life after death is sort
56:45 of proof of life before death isn't it
56:49 what was it Houdini told his wife you
56:52 know if there's any method whatsoever
56:54 for me to come back and talk to you or
56:56 communicate with you I will do it and I
56:59 believe that she was later asked whether
57:01 or not something happened and she said
57:02 no John Lennon said he would float
57:05 across the room as a white feather I
57:08 think that's correct
57:09 I have a friend of mine here in Orange
57:14 County
57:14 her stepfather who was for all intents
57:18 and purposes her father had passed away
57:21 of cancer a couple years ago and
57:25 whatever the case was in their
57:27 conversation they said I will come back
57:31 as a white butterfly well those little
57:33 teeny tiny ones you know and so I was
57:37 very good friends with her still him for
57:40 at least a year
57:41 before this event occurred where he
57:43 passed and you know he suffered for
57:45 about two years so by the time he was
57:47 out you know we're kind of in that kind
57:50 of purgatory of well least he's he's in
57:53 a better place you know he's not he's
57:54 not hurting or whatever but obviously I
57:56 never met the gentleman but she and her
58:00 mother were very
58:01 very you know sad because he left right
58:04 he's a great man
58:06 no sooner did this guy pass and I'm not
58:09 exaggerating
58:11 to my knowledge I have never had a white
58:13 butterfly in this backyard
58:15 I've had other butterflies but they've
58:18 always had lots of paint jobs on him
58:19 pretty large butterflies like I was at
58:22 the Meadowlark butterfly something like
58:25 that anyway it was a little white
58:28 butterfly however while I was working on
58:30 the ground I mean I think I had just
58:34 completed a phone call with her and his
58:36 little dudes over there flying around
58:38 you know and then she said that with her
58:41 mother and her and they're not I mean
58:43 they're religious but not you know not
58:46 insane I mean not like evangelical
58:48 preaching it everywhere they go carrying
58:51 their Bible in their hand there's
58:52 nothing like that but they said that she
58:55 said that as soon as she came out of the
58:56 hospital she went through a certain
58:59 states I think I mentioned this once
59:00 before but she came out of the hospital
59:01 I mean he just passed upstairs comes out
59:05 of hospital she says soon as I exited
59:07 the door jamb I got this euphoric
59:09 feeling that everything was okay Wow
59:15 because this hit her very very hard a
59:17 few days later and even the
59:19 anniversaries are still hard but she
59:22 said then there was the white butterfly
59:23 her and mother were walking they take
59:25 little vacations together because we
59:26 have all these little cool beaches to go
59:28 to they take these vacations or they go
59:29 on walks together and butter this white
59:32 butterfly will be hop hopscotching
59:34 the shrubbery along the way of their
59:37 walk
59:39 they don't have ghost stories they're
59:41 not psychic people I mean they don't
59:44 have any other claims of fame in this
59:46 sort of paranormal realm so i 100%
59:51 believe it I know I don't know if where
59:54 she lives they're more prone to exist
59:56 but again what I'm looking at here
59:59 besides my computer showing me the sound
60:01 wave of this conversation we're having
60:03 in the camera I look at nothing but
60:06 nature you know I've got green all the
60:09 way around me and so this is a haven for
60:12 little butterflies to do their thing
60:14 and by the way this was in I believe
60:18 October a couple years ago 2017 I don't
60:23 know how much butterflies white
60:24 butterflies manifest in October it was
60:27 still fairly decent probably like it is
60:29 today about 71 73 degrees so it wasn't
60:33 like winter so when I see any form of
60:38 evidence that there is some sort of
60:41 existence of life after death then I
60:44 have to endorse the notion that we have
60:48 obviously souls before you can't believe
60:49 reincarnation and it only goes one way
60:51 you guys has to go both ways what's most
60:54 believable to me are folks that tell me
60:56 stories about previous lives who are
61:00 otherwise extremely stable human beings
61:03 they don't have a tremendous amount of
61:06 other wild stories in that realm it's
61:09 not that those folks aren't telling the
61:10 truth it's just for me it's easier to
61:13 believe the person who for instance as
61:18 an analogy again my buddy's father was a
61:20 test pilot in 30s and 40s and on his
61:24 deathbed and I believe the 70s I think
61:28 actually he wouldn't have necessarily
61:30 had to die in his 70s but he went on his
61:31 deathbed he pulled his son aside his son
61:35 is extremely famous special effects
61:38 Gruber here in Los Angeles I mean really
61:40 famous yeah and he told his son he goes
61:44 look I have held this from you your
61:46 whole life but I'm gonna tell you now
61:48 one time I was up flying and I can only
61:51 imagine like super high altitude flying
61:53 around that timeframe the 40s or so
61:55 would have been maybe 60 or sorry 40,000
61:58 feet probably but I have no idea but he
62:01 said this round craft came up to my car
62:04 or rep told him to come up to my jet and
62:06 had strobing lights around the entire
62:08 outside of this vehicle it was like a
62:10 saucer very flat very flat like a
62:13 pancake and maybe give it a couple
62:16 inches of thickness and it was toying
62:20 with me and he goes I couldn't do
62:22 anything because if I tried to do any
62:24 evasive maneuvers the craft I was in was
62:27 not capable of doing anything at
62:28 altitude in that speed and so I was
62:31 terrified and it finally flew off and
62:33 didn't touch me but it was so close it
62:36 was like it was about to touch my wing
62:38 which would have killed me so I will
62:41 tell you that people who tell stories
62:43 like that which is a lot of the Roswell
62:46 people too did the same exact thing they
62:48 waited to their deathbeds to say
62:50 anything that's huge isn't it isn't that
62:53 huge
62:53 you're they have absolute absolutely
62:56 absolutely absolutely validated
62:58 themselves for being of the highest
63:03 level of integrity we can ask for in a
63:06 human being can't isn't it the case so
63:09 some folks have told me those previous
63:11 life stories and they have those those
63:17 attributes / I don't know they have that
63:24 shyness about the story now there is a a
63:32 method in a practice out there where
63:34 again people believe that they are
63:38 suffering the slings and arrows today
63:40 because of things that they have held in
63:41 the past things that they've done in the
63:43 past like they need to repent sometimes
63:46 again I I was touching out earlier in
63:49 this conversation but sometimes you will
63:52 try that go up fort of this way I've
63:55 been I was in Silicon Valley when the
63:57 internet exploded and I was pretty much
64:00 in software the second that people
64:02 started getting personal computers you
64:05 know I was in it so early that people
64:08 were rejecting mice you know connected
64:11 to computers they thought that CD trays
64:12 were coffee cup holders I mean that's
64:15 how early I got into this when I'd say
64:17 push any key to continue they go or
64:19 where's the any key I mean I'm not
64:20 joking and so I've seen friends of mine
64:24 with a thimble of my knowledge turned
64:28 into multi-millionaire simply because
64:29 they stepped in the right place and the
64:31 world at the right time sign up to the
64:33 right company the company goes public
64:34 they make tremendous amounts of money
64:36 and they never really learned anything
64:38 about their art they just happen to be a
64:40 part of a company there
64:42 really blew up and good for them you
64:44 know but then you'll live a life where
64:47 you have been at the right place at the
64:48 right time you think you're innovating
64:51 absolute state-of-the-art technology
64:53 that is an imperative it's an obligatory
64:55 moment in time and it will happen you
64:58 have the best product in the market and
65:00 for whatever reason the team that is
65:02 trying to market this product to the
65:05 company to the world excuse me and you
65:07 know make it take off as a popular
65:09 product so we can all get paid for our
65:11 ideas it just fails and so when this
65:16 happens to you four or five times in
65:17 your life you're like geez what did I do
65:19 in a previous life if you know that I
65:20 can't get this pay off and then some of
65:23 you might think this other thought that
65:27 I have every once in a while which is
65:28 well if I had won the lottery at 18
65:32 years old and won a hundred million
65:34 dollars whatever the payoff is I get a
65:36 hundred million dollars I could almost
65:39 guarantee you this show wouldn't exist
65:40 and it wouldn't exist for two different
65:43 reasons one I probably wouldn't be in
65:45 this house at this particular time with
65:47 any desire to do this but to all the
65:51 things I've learned over the years that
65:52 I put in episodes I probably wouldn't
65:55 have learned them so it's one of these
65:58 things of like what do you want to be do
66:00 you want to be rich and lazy it
66:03 definitely sounds appealing when you've
66:04 had a really long stretch of hard work
66:08 you've had some a lot of successes and
66:11 failures but you're kind of like I need
66:13 a break I need a break you know that a
66:14 lottery ticket sounds really good but in
66:18 the end after especially seeing and I've
66:22 talked about this several times on the
66:23 show seeing people with lots of money
66:25 that didn't buy into the money but
66:27 normal homes kept their old car they
66:31 could do anything they could go anywhere
66:32 in the planet live anywhere and they
66:35 just decided to stay normal and stay
66:38 hunkered down in their intellects in
66:40 their creation the perfectionism only
66:43 got better over time not worse they've
66:47 taught me a valuable lesson what's also
66:50 interesting about the notion of being
66:52 Nefertiti which is interesting or Jesus
66:55 Christ or
66:55 Winston Churchill or something like that
66:57 is that especially for the Nefertiti
67:00 people the end of course it probably
67:04 goes without saying that the people who
67:06 claim this are usually very I don't know
67:10 very sensitive people very high I was
67:14 Nefertiti you know it's never like yeah
67:17 no I think I was an effort to D why is
67:18 that well because I remember everything
67:20 about that era I remember my husband it
67:24 was a pharaoh I remember the workers I
67:26 had this friend of my servants you know
67:28 it's never any details it's just I was
67:30 famous but they're jumping back
67:34 potentially and again there's fake
67:38 history then there's real history one
67:41 actually has a lot of pseudo facts and
67:43 one has almost no knowledge at all right
67:44 real histories like empty but they're
67:48 jumping back a minimum of like three to
67:51 five thousand years with even official
67:53 history with no recollection of anything
67:55 in between so why would an individual
67:59 remember something that far back and not
68:02 the one they were last a part of I mean
68:06 if I met a person who was like Queen
68:08 Elizabeth and I sat down with her and
68:10 she's like yeah I'm pretty sure I was a
68:13 plumber but I was a guy I had like eight
68:17 kids and I've tracked it down I lived
68:20 over here in England you know in London
68:22 a long time ago and I hated my relatives
68:26 you know my role relatives today which I
68:28 wasn't related to back then because I
68:30 was repressed and I hated the stamp tax
68:32 and I hated all his other stuff and
68:34 she's going on and on honestly that'd be
68:37 easier to believe because who I mean
68:41 maybe maybe that's the kind of fantasy a
68:43 world the person has but just you know
68:47 transposing from the haves and the
68:48 have-nots would be a little more
68:51 believable but it's always the have-nots
68:52 becoming the haves I am poor and
68:55 insignificant today in my own mind and
68:57 so I'm becoming the most amazing
68:59 amazingly celebrated females in world
69:03 history
69:05 a little instant band-aid on whatever
69:07 ego problems you might have right now
69:10 what isn't a sin not that any of this is
69:14 a sin but one is not a problem is to
69:16 fantasize purely as a game in your mind
69:19 that you were someone very noble such
69:22 that in this world you are more noble
69:25 you make those noble choices you simply
69:27 ask yourself what would I have done back
69:29 in those days
69:29 Mark Twain wouldn't have done that and
69:32 Tesla wouldn't have done that
69:33 you know Gandhi wouldn't have done that
69:35 and so you you portray yourself better
69:37 in this life there are reasons why these
69:41 individuals are heroes to us at least in
69:44 the fictional realm but just in closing
69:47 think about the fact of how taboo the
69:51 paranormal is we don't talk about it do
69:54 we no one wants to go into a room well
69:57 hey guys let me tell you about my
69:59 previous life I've now recalled two of
70:02 them back-to-back I know exactly where
70:04 by my soul migrated through this world
70:07 and I'm working on the third you know in
70:09 about a week or two I'll have the third
70:11 one figured out nobody does that
70:13 and so because we don't the the more I
70:21 would say factually prone experiences
70:25 are not being discussed by anyone so my
70:30 question for you guys is have any of you
70:32 thought you had a previous life and how
70:38 did it start and the ones I guess I'm
70:41 more interested in would be those
70:43 without a sofa and a hypnotist what were
70:48 the first indicators that you were like
70:50 you know I had this thing or maybe you
70:51 work one of those little kids that grew
70:53 up in thought you lived in a different
70:55 town when you date in the Midwest
70:58 there's there is something very
70:59 interesting that happens and I don't see
71:03 kids in the big city doing this at all
71:05 but in the Midwest we have graveyards
71:08 and graveyards are typically very I'm
71:14 gonna say religious but not in a
71:16 Christian or any other way they're very
71:20 ordained respected locations where you
71:24 go and you can sit down in front of the
71:26 tombstone you can bring new flowers or
71:28 whatever they liked on their tombstone
71:30 you can sit down and just have a
71:31 conversation now it's a bit of a
71:33 ludicrous geographical thing to do that
71:36 but it's one of these things if well I
71:37 don't know where you are in this big
71:39 universe but if I come back to your
71:41 tombstone I'm assuming that this
71:43 location is as good as any to ensure the
71:46 highest probability that you're
71:48 listening to me which again may be
71:50 stupid maybe the last thing anyone wants
71:51 to do is hang out at their tombstone
71:53 it's almost like you got a little a
71:55 little little button there you know the
71:58 one that you click before you go into a
71:59 gated house as mr. Jones there you know
72:02 maybe it's that kind of thing but when
72:05 you like I've dated at least one
72:08 individual from my hometown after I left
72:10 my hometown and you know her and I would
72:13 go out and visit the tombstones of our
72:16 relatives and some member like really
72:19 pop a you know polished really easy to
72:21 get to places and some of them are
72:23 absolutely in the boonies and I mean
72:26 only the churches and the families know
72:30 that these these cemeteries are there
72:32 and you get in them and they're they're
72:35 beautiful like someone's mowing them
72:37 someone's taking care of them big giant
72:39 tombstones in some cases sometimes
72:41 little tiny little plaques you know you
72:44 know I had seen my grandparents my
72:48 father sides tombstones before their
72:50 little flat ones because they're in a
72:52 cemetery where they have to be able to
72:53 mow over all of the tombstones and my
72:57 grandfather was part of the Masons in my
72:59 hometown and I never knew that and
73:03 there's a little Masonic Lodge which
73:05 I've taken a picture of at times very
73:08 beautiful little red brick building
73:09 two-story it's at least two stories but
73:13 I never do that and so he has his you
73:16 know the little whatever the thing is
73:18 with the gian it's a little forgot the
73:20 hell you call it thing and so my
73:24 grandmother stume stone had a pentagram
73:26 on it because that's I guess what the
73:29 wife gets if she had known
73:33 that probably it was symbolizing she
73:36 would never have that on her tombstone
73:38 but you go back and and you sit down you
73:41 look at that and you're like oh my god
73:42 there's a bit of history there right
73:43 there on the tombstone I never knew
73:45 about it's interesting so again if
73:52 you've had this experience please share
73:54 again we're we're just scratching a
73:57 little pain off of this thing that's
74:00 gonna reveal underneath it these onion
74:01 layers that are coming off but again you
74:04 know it's hard people will link me over
74:06 to videos sometimes that are just so out
74:08 of this world you know I try to watch
74:11 him and try to be as objective as
74:12 possible but you know when someone
74:17 starts pulling out a Bible to tell me
74:19 how the world works it's like okay go
74:22 for the parables go for the lessons that
74:24 were passed down from thousands of years
74:27 before even the Old Testament was
74:28 conceived and you know those are the
74:31 things we should listen to remind
74:33 ourselves of the behavior of Christ is
74:36 very important for us to know how gentle
74:39 and beautiful and nurturing we can be
74:40 with each other it's very important but
74:45 you have a lot of Fred Rogers in this
74:46 world too that have the same exact
74:48 capability so I think there's knowledge
74:53 everywhere and everyone and again you
74:56 may not figure out 99 percent of your
74:58 world but that one percent
75:01 it could be profound with one comment in
75:06 one place the right time right place you
75:09 could touch ten thousand people so again
75:12 I know we just scratched the surface of
75:16 this this is sort of not your super deep
75:18 dive with a bunch of wild evidence but I
75:20 thought I'd share my own personal
75:21 experience with that just in case it it
75:25 it brings together something in your own
75:28 life that you can share with us thank
75:32 you fill me if you have mitt of deep
75:34 thoughts radio calm please go it's where
75:36 audio video exists a locked Facebook
75:38 group a Twitter feed and a patreon page
75:41 for those who want to contribute to the
75:43 tips
75:45 it's about all I have for you today take
75:48 care of yourself and someone else and
75:49 I'll see in the next deep thoughts over
75:51 now
