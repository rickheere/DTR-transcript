00:14 so
00:19 [Music]
00:27 [Music]
00:35 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen
00:38 i'm trying to set the new so we'll see
00:40 i'm actually using my computer to render
00:41 some images
00:42 while i record it's got plenty of
00:44 horsepower to do it because i think
00:45 recording doesn't do much
00:47 so we'll see hopefully everything stays
00:49 in sync
00:51 so today is another one of those days
00:52 where i am
00:55 trying to i don't know exude
00:59 thought processes that i've had
01:02 and i think i've got an angle here that
01:04 is rather interesting to me
01:06 hopefully it's interesting to you you
01:09 know
01:11 i mean as you can see this is going to
01:12 be called colliding realities
01:15 different than parallel realities which
01:18 i did an episode on
01:21 and there's an inf there's a difference
01:24 about
01:24 how i want to approach this with your
01:26 minds
01:28 so it's it's so cold it's 44 degrees so
01:31 i'm making smoke without smoking
01:33 i should just fake it right it's one
01:36 thing to sit
01:37 around and think about things like
01:39 parallel realities you'll read an
01:41 article
01:42 in a magazine but it's really just a
01:45 philosophical
01:47 mathematical argument on a piece of
01:49 paper for a physicist
01:53 and so it's kind of always over there
01:56 it's never
01:56 where you're sitting i have
02:00 two things i want to bring to your
02:02 attention
02:03 to center you in the center of this
02:06 discussion
02:09 that might change the way you sort of
02:11 perceive this which is the following
02:14 if you've ever been touched by the
02:15 medela effect then for the very first
02:18 time in your life
02:20 a parallel reality or some distortion in
02:24 reality something around the fabric of
02:26 reality
02:27 suddenly hits you such that you're like
02:30 oh my god this isn't just a theory
02:32 anymore i'm sitting in the middle of it
02:33 doesn't mean any of the papers you've
02:34 ever read or articles you ever read or
02:36 people rumored about it were right
02:40 it just means maybe something occurred
02:44 around 2013 where we got a distinction
02:48 between
02:48 what we remember being taught as kids
02:50 and what we remember experiencing
02:53 and what is today so what's the
02:56 difference
02:58 i will tell you that for me the mandela
03:00 effect
03:01 you know is either taken seriously by
03:02 individuals or it's
03:04 pooh-poohed by individuals right
03:08 the smartest people i know on planet
03:09 earth have them
03:12 big ones one of the prodigy kids that i
03:16 worked with for the last 10 years she's
03:18 now just
03:19 just turned 18 but she was around eight
03:22 when we started talking
03:23 at least this kid is so brilliant that
03:28 you could talk to her for hours and
03:29 hours and hours as a
03:31 person who is 20 30 years older than her
03:34 and
03:34 you wouldn't notice it
03:38 you can throw anything and she'll grab
03:39 it
03:41 she has a phenomenal memory she is
03:44 smarter than most adults and when i say
03:46 most adults we're probably talking about
03:48 95 percent and up of adults
03:52 doesn't mean she doesn't have you know
03:53 kid characteristics and that kind of
03:54 stuff but she's brilliant
03:56 and when i mentioned the mandela effect
03:58 to her she had already been down the
04:00 rabbit hole because
04:02 here she is when i talked to her about
04:04 the mandela effect it must have been
04:06 i don't know what uh 2016.
04:10 so four years ago so she would have been
04:11 14. she just come
04:13 out of that childish phase where she's
04:16 you know one of her biggest complaints
04:17 to me was i have to pretend to be stupid
04:20 when i'm around my friends
04:21 because they're not like me it was one
04:23 of the
04:24 sort of a subliminal depression
04:26 depressing thing that she had to get
04:27 through but she we got her through it
04:31 she's gonna love getting older but she
04:33 swore up and down she's like look
04:35 i just got out of this phase where
04:37 berenstein bears were read to us as kids
04:41 and now i'm hearing it's barren stain
04:44 she because i guarantee you was
04:45 berenstein just a few years ago
04:49 which technically she's talking about
04:51 being about 8 years old to 12 years old
04:54 because you'd have to dial back to
04:56 apparently what we all seem to believe
04:59 i mean i don't have any fixation on this
05:00 number but around 2013
05:04 consequently when the certain hadron
05:06 collider hit its high acceleration
05:08 impacts we got this
05:10 weird thing but we got a lot more than
05:14 that
05:16 eli whitney as i said was a black guy my
05:19 entire life he was
05:21 also linked to my great grandfather
05:25 louis allen john who i guess he's my
05:28 great great
05:30 who had an invention based on
05:33 the cotton gin but when i was in uh
05:37 i pretty sure it was uh actually third
05:40 grade
05:40 because i went to half a third grade in
05:42 this one particular school my hometown
05:46 he was taught to me as irony a black man
05:50 who picked cotton understood how they
05:52 used to use branches
05:54 to wrap up the cotton in a branch and
05:56 pull it off and put it in the bag and he
05:58 said geez why don't we just create a
05:59 machine
06:00 that attacks a cotton tree and rips all
06:03 this stuff off
06:05 now he's a white guy for meal
06:08 okay when i asked a 74 year old friend
06:12 of mine
06:12 and a 58 for your friend of mine in the
06:14 same exact room i said what do you guys
06:16 because i said if you're the mandela
06:17 effect they said no
06:18 i said what do you remember about eli
06:20 whitney because they go what is it and i
06:22 said well let me give you an example
06:24 i'm in a big studio with a bunch of led
06:26 screens it's just
06:28 unbelievable laboratory and these dudes
06:30 looked at me
06:31 the younger guy was further away my
06:33 other buddies in the middle i'm about 10
06:35 feet from him
06:36 in unison they both said well all i
06:38 remember was he was a black guy
06:42 that's 74 years of age and that person
06:45 was raised all around the world he got
06:49 the same education
06:50 and the other guy i have no idea what
06:51 his background is but both guys are
06:54 legendarily brilliant people validated
06:56 by everything they've ever done
06:59 and they saw it differently as well
07:04 so what's the big difference there why
07:06 am i bringing that up
07:08 well it takes those outside theories and
07:11 it puts them puts you right in the pilot
07:12 seat
07:15 it makes it so that when you're driving
07:16 down the street you're kind of looking
07:17 around going oh my god is this
07:19 you know is this reality what i think it
07:21 is
07:22 is it a multiverse but instead of
07:26 worrying about the
07:28 higgs boson particle which most likely
07:30 doesn't exist
07:32 and worrying about whether or not the
07:34 universe is going to fly apart or not
07:38 what i want to get us to start doing is
07:41 and i'm sure many of you do this start
07:45 looking at everyday reality at the most
07:48 minute subtle
07:50 ways and i want you to look at it in
07:53 every dimension of reality that you can
07:56 discern because you might start noticing
07:59 other things
08:00 that are potentially as engaging as the
08:03 mandela effect not
08:04 necessarily like it at all when i
08:07 started waking up
08:09 in 2003 to this event in
08:13 september 11th i remember
08:16 trying to show some of my family who are
08:19 very close to me
08:20 hey look at this video this is crazy you
08:22 can see this you can see that look at
08:23 all this evidence da da
08:26 and i remember watching them and today i
08:29 can give you an analogy which is
08:31 again the hosts in westworld would which
08:34 is the robots
08:35 they would look at something from the
08:37 outside world because they were
08:38 programmed not to see it their response
08:40 was always it doesn't look like anything
08:43 to me
08:43 they just couldn't see it they were
08:45 programmed not to see it
08:47 but that's sort of how my relatives were
08:49 responding
08:51 to unequivocal evidence that at least
08:53 the official story wasn't right
08:57 and that started shocking me because i
08:58 was like wow
09:00 either you're just really stupid as a
09:03 human being
09:04 or you have a very very soft
09:08 consciousness they can't see something
09:10 that contradicts your narrative
09:11 that you had injected in you from the
09:13 media
09:16 maybe you're a pussycat maybe you're
09:17 terrified of the world and if you
09:19 acknowledge anything that's different oh
09:21 my gosh
09:23 gonna be a problem so i kept
09:26 so that's that shook me i had this one
09:30 session in this house
09:31 probably you know damn near 15 years ago
09:36 and i'm just showing videos like i
09:37 showed the squibs coming out of the
09:39 buildings i showed
09:40 physics denying this being a possibility
09:43 just
09:43 all kinds of stuff i didn't have the
09:44 stuff i have today
09:46 and just kept watching and it it
09:49 transitioned from me being interested in
09:50 them
09:51 waking up and teaming up with me to use
09:55 their intellect
09:57 to fill in the blanks that i don't see
09:59 right i mean it'd be best if
10:01 10 of us work together on a rabbit hole
10:04 than one of us
10:05 right that's why there's a lot of good
10:06 youtube channels where there's three or
10:08 more people
10:09 and you know one guy goes in one
10:10 direction girl goes another one etc etc
10:13 right
10:15 then we kept moving forward in time with
10:18 my relatives especially
10:20 and there might be you know
10:23 differences in in political philosophies
10:26 whether or not you should change a
10:27 country to be socialistic or keep it to
10:29 be capitalistic
10:32 and different subjects i mean just just
10:34 hundreds of subjects and i kept seeing
10:37 them differ which is fine
10:40 but then when i would listen to their
10:42 rationale
10:44 it was amazing how they were absorbing
10:47 well i would say this much i
10:48 probably used the wrong word there they
10:50 would come back to me with this
10:52 it doesn't look like anything to me
10:54 mentality
10:56 unable to see what
11:00 everyone else is not having a problem
11:01 seeing
11:03 i thought man that's really weird
11:06 and in a particular night and this is
11:08 probably damn near
11:10 10 years before i started this show
11:13 don't remember
11:15 i started having this little voice in my
11:17 head like one of those little celestial
11:19 voices where you're kind of like you
11:21 know who am i talking to
11:22 man you know or am i listening to i
11:24 should say but this
11:25 heavy instinct which said two things
11:30 one you're all right don't worry about
11:33 anything
11:36 you are in one reality and they are in
11:39 another reality
11:40 and you are merely sharing these
11:43 meetings that you have
11:46 when you get together have you ever had
11:50 the
11:50 just the basic situation where you've
11:53 been in your house
11:54 well especially in 2020 you've been in
11:56 your world for quite a while you got
11:57 your stuff
11:58 whatever that is your tvs your keyboard
12:01 your guitars
12:02 your art supplies whatever it is you're
12:04 doing your backyard
12:08 and then you go to someone else's house
12:10 and it feels like a new world
12:12 their house is different it can be
12:15 totally cool could be totally mingy
12:17 whatever but you're kind of like wow
12:19 this is like a little adventure away
12:20 from home
12:22 definitely happens when you vacation but
12:23 you you pre-meditate in your mind that
12:26 vacationing is something that's going to
12:28 introduce something totally different
12:29 the further you go away from home
12:31 like when i went to hawaii for the first
12:33 time man talk about another dimension
12:35 man i went through the old airport
12:38 where you know elvis and don ho went
12:40 through
12:42 and so i felt the entire time like i was
12:45 in
12:45 a different planet with humans wonderful
12:49 experience
12:50 when you travel to a foreign country
12:52 it's massively like that
12:54 the more observant you are of course
12:58 but you can do it within the states with
13:00 whatever country you live you
13:02 travel across the country to visit your
13:05 parents visit a buddy
13:06 whatever and what we
13:10 i think failed to recognize
13:14 is there might be a bigger game going on
13:15 when we travel from place to place
13:19 if the human consciousness can truly
13:21 forge
13:22 a proprietary reality around you because
13:26 the human mind is a proprietary reality
13:30 it projects electricity and thought and
13:32 frequency
13:34 out into the universe
13:37 but it has a limited range of influence
13:41 a sphere around the human body who knows
13:44 the radius
13:46 but you start to create this reality and
13:49 you start to love it
13:51 that's why a lot of folks don't like to
13:52 travel they like where they are
13:55 they feel comfortable where they are
13:56 maybe they have some subconscious fears
13:58 of
13:59 the unknown little xenophobic
14:01 precautions
14:03 but i don't think we really recognize it
14:06 for what it is i think we simply say
14:08 it's just because my country makes homes
14:11 like this and roads like this
14:12 and traffic signs like this and we
14:14 typically buy these cars and wear those
14:15 clothes and listen to this music
14:18 and so we just chalk it up to a big
14:20 difference
14:21 in the commodities that we purchase
14:24 it's interesting when you go to an
14:25 amusement park and you just just
14:28 leap into a ride disneyland is a
14:31 fantastic example
14:34 there's rides there's worlds right so
14:36 tomorrowland fantasyland and frontier
14:38 land and
14:39 [Music]
14:42 adventureland now star wars land
14:46 what's interesting is to me the more
14:48 patina
14:49 that one of those areas in the park has
14:51 the more that you can feel the
14:53 underlying genetics of the individuals
14:55 that manicure the place that created the
14:57 place that thought it up
14:59 it's not just a bunch of corporate
15:01 brands on rides
15:03 the deeper you understand walt disney's
15:05 intention
15:06 for the universe you don't see those
15:09 brands you're just like yeah whatever
15:11 that's modern day defaming and defacing
15:15 of a of a great man and a great
15:18 imagineer
15:20 plus him hiring like minds to continue
15:23 the circuitry and of course every ride
15:27 was built by
15:29 brilliant people tons of them
15:32 but you go into pirates of the caribbean
15:34 you immediately get swallowed up into
15:36 its environmental influences
15:38 it's different but could there be more
15:40 than just the paint
15:42 the sculpting the animatronics
15:45 the water could it be
15:48 that because disney as an as an empire
15:52 hires individuals who are definitely
15:54 drinking the kool-aid
15:55 and i drink to kool-aid too in that
15:57 particular realm
15:59 again disneyland for me is the one that
16:00 really touches my heart because that's
16:02 the one that walt
16:03 made that's the only one he ever saw
16:07 but you're in there
16:10 and you're in a different world it
16:12 starts to feel different
16:15 there's a there's in fact there's two
16:17 portions of that ride
16:18 one of the portions is a cave less
16:21 intimate
16:22 less feedback because human beings don't
16:23 live in caves anymore at least i don't
16:26 but once you turn the corner and you go
16:28 through the little portal
16:30 you get into the pirate scene you get
16:32 into the little town and now it's
16:33 starting to have things that we have
16:36 make-believe homes pirates that are like
16:39 human beings
16:40 not skeletons they're singing songs
16:43 you've got donkeys singing you have
16:46 people being auctioned off you know
16:50 and there's just this weird cozy bizarre
16:53 thing that's going on inside that
16:55 influence
16:56 well if you think about it it's built by
16:58 people who are trying to create an
16:59 illusion and it's maintained by people
17:01 that absorbed the illusion because it
17:03 was already built when they got there
17:05 so everyone's consciousness
17:08 goes through different phases of course
17:10 when you work there for a long time it
17:11 all becomes
17:12 machines that have to be maintenanced
17:15 but you'd be surprised man the people
17:18 that are very
17:19 intense disney workers are absolutely
17:22 embedded
17:23 in the good part of the franchise
17:27 i've got more than one friend who
17:30 usually works there
17:31 now it's all on hold i just asked our
17:34 well i'm sorry a guy i met today that
17:35 works there
17:37 i said why is disney world open
17:38 disneyland's not and he goes our
17:40 governor
17:42 and now they're going through like their
17:43 second round of layoffs just nuts man
17:48 i got friends that are sous chefs
17:50 friends that used to do security a
17:52 couple friends that used to do security
17:54 but they're exceptionally wonderful
17:57 people like their hearts and souls are
17:59 exactly the kind of people
18:00 that have walt met them himself he would
18:02 hire them
18:04 i think the shift in thinking that i'm
18:06 trying to get
18:08 acknowledged here because i think some
18:10 of you already do it
18:11 if you're not doing it it's a real
18:13 interesting twist on your day
18:16 you know we get up we get cleaned up we
18:18 get in our cars we go places
18:21 we're always ingesting realities
18:25 now what are the elements at play
18:28 when discussing realities colliding
18:32 meaning what variables change
18:35 what variables exchange data which
18:38 variables cancel out other variables
18:41 i'm going to put a graphic that i'm
18:42 going to make on screen
18:44 of sort of my vision of in my brain of
18:47 how this works
18:48 it's going to be a silly couple planes
18:52 of reality or maybe multiple ones
18:54 colliding with each other story lines
18:57 that might be projected on a 2d plane
19:00 but i want you to think about the
19:02 earth's surface
19:05 it doesn't matter what shape you think
19:06 the earth is
19:08 you will be at any one point in time
19:12 at an xy longitude latin latitude
19:15 coordinate on the surface of this place
19:17 we are on
19:20 i'm in one place you're in a different
19:21 place
19:23 and we simply chalk up reality to hey
19:25 we're all in the same reality
19:27 and i'm over here and you're over there
19:29 you have your stuff i have my stuff i
19:31 have the way i think you have the way
19:32 you think
19:33 and of course the human mind's unique
19:36 perception
19:37 of reality is built out of all the
19:39 experiences that we had
19:41 at least since we were born
19:45 probably several influences before we
19:48 were born
19:49 if reincarnation is a real thing which i
19:51 think it is
19:53 i don't think it's linear i don't think
19:54 you just simply die and get reborn i i
19:57 don't believe that i think there's
19:58 there's logic to a green room
20:02 break between lives to assess what you
20:06 just experienced perhaps when you come
20:08 back you could start right after you
20:10 died and go into a new
20:12 baby but there would be nothing
20:15 preventing you from going back in time
20:16 going forward in time changing planets
20:19 whatever so i know that there's a lot of
20:23 variables and possibilities at play when
20:26 thinking about
20:26 what is your perception of reality hence
20:30 you can't
20:33 put forth in my opinion this theory of
20:36 parallel realities or colliding
20:37 realities
20:39 which i'm gonna say colliding is a
20:40 little bit different than the parallel
20:44 until we can kind of dismiss everything
20:47 that's
20:48 incidental in our perception of
20:51 everything now there was a show
20:54 on tv called fringe
20:57 it is an amazing show i believe it has
21:00 five seasons it is worth a purchase on
21:03 dvd
21:04 it is truly a gem that i do not know how
21:08 this didn't become a household word
21:10 for everybody not just the ones that
21:12 bumped into it
21:13 the acting's fantastic the writing's
21:15 fantastic it's funny
21:17 it's sad it's romantic it is a huge
21:21 techno technological
21:24 series the writer is beyond brilliant
21:28 he borrows very little in a way that you
21:31 can feel him borrowing
21:35 he borrows so subtly from other things
21:38 that it's not like reading a stephen
21:39 king novel where the guy ripped off
21:41 at least 50 of everything he wrote from
21:43 a twilight zone
21:45 you just see it now stephen king did
21:48 come up with some of his own ideas that
21:49 were
21:50 obviously fantastic but in his later
21:53 years he was ending novels
21:55 like it didn't matter anymore strange
21:58 but what fringe
21:59 deals with is a collision and realities
22:04 and they really exhaust
22:08 what factors could be at play
22:11 in their version of this collision they
22:13 have a counterpart like the
22:15 the dark star tracks you know spock with
22:17 a beard i think not you know
22:20 you have a counterpart on the other side
22:22 could be a good person could be a bad
22:23 person
22:25 but there's a lot more at play which i
22:27 won't ruin the series
22:28 for but that creates the tension
22:31 when these literally it's not a
22:35 doppelganger it's like a
22:37 copy of them and the other universe
22:39 starts to interact with the other
22:41 universe
22:42 it's a very specific technology that
22:45 creates
22:46 the problem a very specific event that
22:48 shouldn't have occurred that occurred
22:51 that gets the whole thing started it is
22:53 brilliant i mean the evolution of it's
22:54 fantastic and i will tell you this
22:56 fringe
22:56 ends better than any
23:00 series of its kind it it really has a
23:03 real ending and not one of these up
23:04 we're just done making
23:06 fringe shows so we're just going to end
23:07 this right not like uh the way that
23:09 westworld ended in season three
23:10 nope it ran out of money the elite
23:13 actress is really strange in real life
23:14 we're tired of dealing with their crap
23:15 so we're done
23:17 what would be the variables that you
23:19 would be concerned about colliding
23:22 well i can tell you right away the ones
23:24 that you'll be concerned about are the
23:25 ones that affect you very specifically
23:28 but that's a big big bucket of
23:30 possibilities
23:31 big bucket of variables
23:34 you have two specific
23:37 categories of what's considered your
23:39 life when it comes to a collision
23:42 you have your outside external world
23:45 that is where do you live
23:47 who do you know what book did you read
23:49 when you were a kid who invented the
23:50 cotton gin
23:52 blah blah blah then you have a really
23:54 super important one
23:56 which is you personally your physiology
24:00 your mental capabilities you're feeling
24:02 secure today
24:04 do you feel secure the next day if the
24:06 collision were to occur
24:08 then there's the basic question of am i
24:12 talking about
24:13 an event in history which shouldn't be
24:15 occurring but is occurring
24:16 due to some invention or is this a
24:20 natural ecosystem
24:21 of all reality the message i got
24:25 when i was dealing with the conflicting
24:28 thoughts of
24:29 how the hell am i seeing what i'm seeing
24:33 and they don't see it you know there's a
24:34 picture of the beam
24:36 that was cut at a patented angle in one
24:39 of the world trade centers after they
24:40 fell
24:41 that angle of the beam is patented by
24:44 the family controlled demolition
24:46 controlled demolition was the first
24:47 group of people allowed on the pile
24:49 of the world trade centers after they
24:51 went down before the alphabet agencies
24:53 roamed around
24:54 for the the other stuff to put fake
24:59 red boxes on the ground right or the
25:01 black box excuse me which are actually
25:02 red
25:04 so you're looking at something that's
25:06 pretty conclusive
25:07 that this organization participated in
25:09 that event
25:11 the beams were cut in perfect
25:14 uh sizes to fit on flatbed trucks well
25:17 that's what that family does they
25:18 figured that out a long time ago when we
25:20 just cut the beams
25:21 at exactly the length that will fit on a
25:23 on a vehicle
25:25 of course several of the beams were
25:27 twisted and turned
25:28 and thrown 800 yards because that's what
25:30 happens when things fall down they
25:32 they eject from the center
25:35 it's just air pressure man but i'm
25:37 showing people this stuff
25:39 people who are supposed to be smart
25:42 people if you ask them how smart they
25:43 were oh my gosh boy they
25:45 they'd have to rewrite the iq scale for
25:47 how smart these people are
25:49 but the message i got that was just some
25:52 instinctual little wind in my mind was
25:55 this is natural and this is just what
25:57 happens
26:00 now have you ever seen a situation where
26:03 i'm gonna change the subject on
26:05 you're gonna think but i'm gonna bring
26:06 it back to this
26:08 let's go to the some of the small
26:11 multi-celled bacteria
26:14 that we see amoebas especially there's a
26:17 good one
26:18 but any one of those just you know just
26:21 over single cell creatures
26:25 and they have a little membrane that
26:26 makes up their body
26:29 and sometimes that membrane will be
26:31 pierced by a laboratory experiment but
26:33 sometimes they're
26:34 injured they're bit by another being
26:38 and that internal
26:41 cellular structure or even if it's a
26:43 single cell the mitochondria starts to
26:44 leak out
26:46 and that can be part of a procreation
26:50 or i should say evolutionary injury
26:52 where
26:53 as it leaks out and heals up it creates
26:55 a limb
26:58 it's almost as if you were to say the
27:00 interior of the cell
27:01 is one reality and the outside region is
27:04 another reality
27:05 and it's leaking out into this reality
27:08 it's pushing its way in
27:10 due to an anomaly that broke the
27:13 membrane
27:16 well what if that sort of model
27:20 is sort of what we're dealing with right
27:22 here except it's organic
27:24 it's normal maybe it's not normal
27:28 and because of messing with electricity
27:32 in the form of a collider could be a
27:33 form of a bunch of things
27:36 i mean could you imagine this is a great
27:39 little
27:39 premise for a sci-fi movie that's sort
27:41 of like old
27:44 the second we created the telegram here
27:47 we are stringing electricity
27:48 all around the surface of the earth to
27:50 transmit telegrams
27:52 eventually what to turn into turns into
27:54 the telephone
27:56 then what's that turn into it turns into
27:58 radio
28:00 then it turns into television then it
28:02 turns into
28:04 big time communications for military
28:07 then it turns into internet
28:11 and now we have saturated the surface of
28:13 the earth like a borg
28:14 planet and now with 5g coming out
28:19 in a couple years when the high band
28:21 goes live we're all gonna get
28:23 migraines and vertigo and puke our
28:25 brains out as a hundred
28:27 billion hertz of little teeny tiny
28:32 millimeter waves it's between a
28:35 centimeter and a millimeter depending on
28:37 how they turn it up
28:38 gonna be beaming all over the place out
28:40 of every single
28:42 traffic or street light with a little 5g
28:45 on top
28:47 as each broadcast technology evolves and
28:50 becomes more and more powerful
28:52 perhaps this could be the mechanism by
28:55 which we are
28:57 because it's moving what it's moving
29:01 electricity it is creating
29:04 polar waves of electricity your cell
29:07 phone
29:08 creates a polar wave around the phone
29:12 one goes one way one goes the other way
29:14 just like the vanilla belts coming out
29:15 of planet earth
29:17 when the cell tower wants to talk to
29:19 your phone it is
29:21 piercing that wave creating a binary
29:24 chain
29:25 of ones and zeros and nulls and so your
29:27 phone knows it's getting a call
29:29 it's digital it's fast it's amazing
29:33 electricity is another way of saying
29:34 what
29:36 it's an upper construct of ether and if
29:39 ether
29:41 is the bedrock of our universe
29:44 and it's a bedrock in two different
29:45 perspectives
29:47 in my opinion ether is the bedrock by
29:51 which
29:52 all spiritual energy liaisons to be in
29:55 this world
29:56 anything intelligent with consciousness
29:58 in this world
30:00 is a life force from this
30:03 perhaps parallel but it might be very
30:06 nebulous on the other side who knows
30:08 but it pierces in and becomes a dog a
30:10 cat a human being
30:12 anything that's alive perhaps
30:14 everything's alive
30:16 we don't need to worry about that right
30:17 now plant life is alive
30:20 but as we start stirring the pot
30:24 on the surface of the earth
30:26 [Music]
30:27 we could be ripping a hole in the
30:29 membrane of what we have traditionally
30:31 understood
30:32 as reality
30:36 what happens when you got a trash bag
30:38 full of liquid
30:40 and you accidentally drag it through the
30:41 house and that bag isn't
30:44 completely sealed you got crap all over
30:47 the floor
30:48 stuff leaked out from the inside to the
30:51 outside where it wasn't supposed to be
30:53 a little bit of a mess well
30:56 what if this is organic and what if this
31:02 thing that we don't think is tangible
31:04 right we don't think emotions are
31:06 tangible
31:06 you can't put love in a jar keep it
31:09 reality in a jar necessarily
31:12 from we're thinking about the fabric of
31:14 reality
31:16 it is the jar men but as we ramp up
31:19 whatever we're doing
31:22 if we if we did break the seal
31:25 it just gets more chaotic and more
31:27 chaotic and more chaotic
31:31 some people believe that the world is
31:33 becoming more evil
31:35 some people believe the hadron collider
31:37 people are
31:39 those kind of people because again they
31:41 they worship shiva
31:43 uh what is it the goddess of destruction
31:47 they held those weird rituals they made
31:49 those videos
31:51 uh they were really bizarrely
31:54 just bizarre i'll just say that much
31:56 look like pretty weird
31:58 maria bronovich kind of stuff but who
32:00 knows
32:02 but now here's what's interesting
32:03 interesting about the mandela effect
32:05 it came a bunch of things were
32:09 labeled as mandela effects and again
32:10 it's named after nelson mandela because
32:13 when he died in 2013 a bunch of people
32:15 remember him dying
32:16 in 19 well in the early 90s i guess when
32:19 he was first put in jail he was only
32:21 there for a little while and then he
32:22 died in prison
32:23 i don't have that memory but if you do i
32:26 totally respect the fact that you do
32:28 just like you may have thought eli
32:30 whitney was a white guy
32:31 the entire time and you think i'm kind
32:32 of weird for thinking he was a black guy
32:35 and you know there's a lot of excuses
32:37 about oh you just got the other black
32:39 inventor
32:39 mixed up with that guy um
32:43 both those guys were represented at the
32:44 same time i learned about
32:46 eli now it might be that we just say
32:50 listen to his name it's not really a
32:51 slave name but i don't think that's
32:53 accurate because
32:54 by that time we were trading names
32:58 we weren't kunta kente anymore you know
33:00 they were taking
33:02 regal names
33:05 if he was who i thought who i was raised
33:08 for him to be was a very intelligent
33:09 dude
33:10 i came from intelligent family
33:13 but we have this moment in 2013
33:17 where we had the surge in the mandela
33:19 effect and then what happened
33:21 a bunch of fake stuff came out you know
33:24 people were being jerk offs with it
33:26 because they were trying to muddy up the
33:28 water with it
33:29 fresh prince of bel-air for instance
33:31 recorded two versions of the song
33:35 and decided to go with a more optimized
33:37 version knocking out verses and
33:38 rewriting things
33:40 even the music itself got more refined
33:42 by jazzy jeff
33:43 as i understand it and so someone
33:45 released the
33:46 the unapproved version and so no see you
33:49 know so i used to remember it and
33:51 well it could be that way i guess but
33:53 yeah it could be that way it could be
33:54 that you know one reality the other one
33:56 got approved and the one
33:57 we like today never got created but i
34:00 think that's some trickery
34:02 but uh anne rice not remembering what
34:04 she called interview with
34:06 the vampire or interview with a vampire
34:09 whichever way it is
34:10 she was interviewed for 10 years plus
34:11 all the people who made the movie with
34:13 her
34:14 all saying it the way that it's not
34:16 today i mean
34:17 how is it that the author of the book
34:19 can't remember how it said
34:21 luke i'm your father being recreated by
34:23 mark hamill and
34:25 the dude who plays darth vader's voice
34:28 for 30 plus years
34:30 and then all of a sudden it's no i'm
34:33 your
34:34 father which does make more sense to me
34:36 nowadays
34:37 but it took me a while but we don't have
34:41 unless you're following in and i'm
34:42 unaware we don't have
34:46 another big surge of these things it's
34:47 almost like we took inventory of what
34:49 splattered into our universe from
34:51 another one
34:52 thank god it's nothing big that's the
34:54 cool thing
34:55 it's not like up as down down as up and
34:58 north south south you know all that kind
34:59 of stuff
35:00 to the point where we're crashing our
35:02 cars because
35:04 yeah i mean imagine you wake up one day
35:06 and the red light means green and the
35:07 green light means
35:08 red i mean if you watch some crash
35:11 videos online you'd be
35:13 helping to defend that position because
35:16 people just run red lights like it's
35:17 candy
35:18 it's just nuts but what is the theory of
35:22 parallel realities in general i've been
35:25 looking at this stuff since i was
35:26 probably in early
35:28 well just before i was a teenager i'd
35:30 say
35:32 you read papers they're interesting you
35:34 know i used to get tons of tech
35:36 magazines when i was a kid
35:39 and you know you'd have these
35:40 interesting uh models where there's a
35:43 bunch of bubbles
35:45 the movie brainstorm goes with the
35:46 bubble theory
35:49 but that was a bunch of bubbles for an
35:51 individual's life but you know they'll
35:52 say like
35:53 this sphere that is our universe
35:56 is just one universe and then there's
35:58 another sphere another sphere so
35:59 sometimes it's a bunch of neighboring
36:00 spheres
36:02 sometimes it's once we started realizing
36:04 the fourth dimension
36:06 we started to acknowledge the fact that
36:08 these could all be on top of each other
36:11 and simply vibrating at a different
36:12 frequency
36:15 thus sharing the space you know it's
36:18 that old
36:20 thing you find out when you're young and
36:22 if you came up with this before someone
36:24 showed you this
36:25 then you have a nice iq
36:29 when i was a kid there was this anomaly
36:32 there's a name for the paradox and i
36:33 cannot remember what the hell the name
36:34 of it is
36:35 but you push your two fingers together
36:37 but you don't touch them
36:39 and then in your brain you zoom up so
36:41 there's a bunch of space between it
36:43 and you push them close together and you
36:45 keep zooming up but your fingers
36:47 when you think about the divisibility of
36:49 numbers
36:50 should never technically touch because
36:52 you can always from from a
36:54 perspective zoom in the reality is that
36:58 you have to be shrinking
37:00 and i think that your velocity has to
37:01 continually accelerate
37:03 infinitely for that to be the case
37:05 you'll start living in an utter
37:07 paradox of existence but since they do
37:10 touch
37:12 we have at least
37:15 i guess you could say proof that our
37:18 fabric of reality that we
37:19 coexist in with our souls
37:23 does have a finite unit
37:26 of size and i think that's the ether
37:28 particle
37:29 it could be the ethero particle small or
37:31 has something else smaller it could be
37:33 that there's four or five different
37:34 ether particles that have different
37:36 shapes and spin different ways
37:37 but for now for me it's probably sphere
37:40 since that's the easiest most natural
37:42 shape the universe creates
37:45 and hence because it is a sphere through
37:48 perhaps
37:49 billions of years of being clobbered in
37:51 some vacuum
37:54 however this stuff came to be whether it
37:56 was uh just an is or not
37:59 you have this thing you can rely on when
38:01 you think about how things could be put
38:03 together
38:04 so there wouldn't be technically
38:06 speaking unless
38:08 something very different is occurring
38:10 this ability to layer realities
38:12 infinitely
38:13 however you might be able to layer them
38:16 to an extent where everything that is
38:18 absolutely possible
38:20 everything that could be calculated is
38:22 accounted for
38:23 and the reason why is you have this
38:26 finite limit
38:28 which is because your fingers can touch
38:30 we know it's not infinite
38:32 in terms of possibilities another thing
38:35 to think about when you think about the
38:37 colliding
38:38 realities is
38:42 we like to keep things simple in our
38:44 mind because we're human beings
38:46 and so you might just think two
38:47 realities colliding together
38:49 how bad could it be that's what i love
38:52 about time travel movies and any movie
38:54 that talks about
38:55 multiple dimensions they only go to two
38:58 because they know that
39:00 the audience has a really hard time
39:03 understanding anything more than two
39:05 when the movie movie inception was
39:08 released
39:09 what was phenomenal about inception and
39:12 i don't mean to insult anyone here
39:14 but i will just tell you quite honestly
39:18 my more intellectual existential friends
39:22 love that movie they may not love the
39:25 writing and and
39:26 whatever what are the actors but they
39:29 really like the concept of it which
39:31 it i don't even know how many realities
39:33 they ended up creating in that
39:34 particular movie but it's like half a
39:35 dozen at least
39:37 for me i think they limited it
39:39 brilliantly they gave you enough that it
39:41 would
39:42 sort of make you hurt but then stopped
39:45 and then simplified some of the
39:46 realities visited them very
39:49 infrequently so you didn't have to lean
39:52 on
39:52 let's say it was six realities i don't
39:54 know which how what the number is but
39:55 they didn't
39:56 make you have to memorize six super
39:58 detailed schematics
40:00 each reality seem to have half
40:03 substance in it so the first reality has
40:06 a very detailed reality second one has
40:09 half that
40:10 content third half the half half the
40:12 half half the half so by the time it's
40:13 at the end
40:14 the last one just does like maybe a
40:16 flick of a button that you gotta
40:17 remember
40:19 my friends who are more simple god bless
40:22 them
40:24 they will tell me they hate that movie
40:26 and not because of the acting and the
40:28 writing
40:28 but because of its complexity there's
40:31 something to be said for a beautiful
40:33 mind that is
40:34 simple it's a it's a blissful thing to
40:37 exist in
40:39 so what if i am
40:43 on to something in this and we want to
40:46 go ahead and explore this
40:47 and again it's not my idea
40:50 colliding i i did some research before i
40:52 did the episode to see
40:53 sort of where people's theories on
40:57 colliding realities exist very minimal
41:01 everything seems to really go towards
41:03 parallel now if you have some
41:04 information about
41:06 a good book or a good video that really
41:08 talks about this please link it below
41:10 please please please but now
41:15 let's compare one way we might teach
41:17 something and another way that we might
41:19 actually observe it
41:21 what if the reality is is that this is
41:23 sort of um
41:26 extremely chaotic but okay
41:29 that not one reality is colliding with
41:32 your reality but
41:34 billions and trillions and quadrillions
41:36 etc
41:37 to the power of the same
41:40 so every single second that you choose
41:44 what you're going to do
41:45 you're like you know sort of one of
41:48 those
41:48 funny houses at a carnival you're in the
41:50 hall of mirrors
41:52 and every time you take a step remember
41:54 when you're in the hall of mirrors you
41:54 ever been in one of those where there's
41:56 a bunch of mirrors
41:56 i saw a really cute video the other day
41:58 where our daughter was trying to lead
41:59 her father through
42:00 one of these things in broad daylight
42:02 and she's slamming into windows and
42:04 he's doing the same thing but you feel
42:06 like every step you take you're
42:07 disoriented because
42:09 you're getting reality reflected back to
42:11 you so many different ways in the hall
42:13 of mirrors
42:14 that you're like it doesn't even matter
42:16 which one you're in
42:18 you want to get out of that place to
42:20 re-establish something far
42:22 more linear where you don't have reality
42:24 reflected back to you more than a couple
42:26 of times when you're in the bathroom
42:29 but if this were true and we were able
42:30 to uncover
42:32 perhaps a device that could sense this
42:33 sort of thing perhaps just
42:35 observing reality and logic if anyone
42:39 really tore reality using a hadron
42:42 collider maybe someone defects out and
42:44 says okay here's the deal that's what
42:45 we're doing we're not looking for a
42:47 higgs boson that was a bunch of crap
42:50 we're not looking for big bang because
42:51 that never happened what we're really
42:52 doing is
42:54 yanking a reality down to this one to
42:56 see what would happen
42:58 and even though this thing is 17 miles
43:01 around
43:02 or kilometers i guess you could say
43:05 biggest machine man's ever made by the
43:07 way
43:08 we're only bringing in like a teaspoon
43:10 of some other reality
43:12 and we turned it on and we did it and
43:15 now we're not going to ever do that
43:16 again until we figure out all the data
43:18 what's the damage that we did and all
43:21 they did was they mixed up potentially
43:23 if that
43:24 rumor was true i'm not convinced you
43:27 know some berenstain bears eli whitney a
43:29 bunch of other little things
43:32 it does seem strange right that someone
43:34 would theorize that the hadron collider
43:36 had this profound effect on our reality
43:41 but it only brought in like children's
43:42 books and you know
43:44 a guy invented a cotton gin in america
43:47 my other question is i think i read this
43:50 once but for those of you in different
43:51 countries in america
43:53 what were the mandela effects for you or
43:56 did you not have any was it just an
43:58 epiphany for america
44:00 but if we were to teach this most likely
44:03 it would evolve
44:04 right we would go into a classroom in
44:07 our deep thoughts university
44:09 and we would draw a two-dimensional
44:11 plane tipped up on its side
44:15 and then another plane tipped up on its
44:17 side maybe coming in at a 90 degree
44:18 angle
44:19 so you kind of have a plus sign of two
44:21 planes
44:22 and at the point of impact you have
44:26 potentially an infinitely small moment
44:29 where the two collided
44:31 and information traded places
44:34 but because it's an infinitely small
44:35 collision
44:38 because the plane has no dimensions
44:40 really
44:41 you need a third dimension to really get
44:42 volume so we get a cube
44:45 out of a plane
44:48 maybe uh there's some weird thing going
44:50 on
44:51 you're getting little pushes and prods
44:54 here and there
44:55 ever had any intuition in your life
44:58 ever have some epiphany of a story and
45:02 all sudden it fleets and goes away what
45:04 if that is nothing more than you
45:06 acknowledging
45:07 one of the impacts and isn't it
45:10 interesting
45:10 if you're creative when you go to bed
45:12 and you put your head on the pillow when
45:13 you relax your mind
45:15 and you divorce yourself in this reality
45:16 because your eyes are closed
45:18 you're going into the twilight zone the
45:21 stage before dreaming
45:23 you'll hear a song you should write down
45:25 you hear a joke you should write down
45:27 you get a premise of a movie you should
45:29 really write down
45:30 you laugh at a joke because you thought
45:32 of something funny
45:33 but you know if you don't get up and
45:35 write it down
45:38 it's in one ear and out the other don't
45:40 even remember it the next day
45:42 you might remember god there was
45:43 something funny i laughed about the
45:44 other day what was it about
45:45 and you search your mind and unlike
45:48 anybody
45:48 anyone who told you a joke that day if i
45:51 told you a joke
45:52 even a one-liner and you're like oh man
45:55 that's so hilarious
45:56 and then the next day i said what was
45:57 that one-liner i told you you would at
45:59 least
46:00 be able to come up with some of the dna
46:01 that was about something what was that
46:03 thing about the guy
46:04 and the d you'd have something if you
46:06 couldn't explicitly remember why you
46:08 laughed
46:09 but these little moments these little
46:11 gems these quote unquote ideas
46:15 which people feel like come from the
46:16 heavens sometimes
46:18 if you don't grab them like the
46:19 butterfly net and hold on to them and be
46:22 careful to them write them down before
46:23 they disappear
46:24 they're gone i told you the other day
46:27 about
46:29 the holographs that i've or holograms
46:32 that i have heard
46:33 uh theorized to be created and again one
46:36 of them is
46:37 very above board i believe which is
46:39 burning air
46:40 two lasers go in a direction
46:43 in a room and when they hit each other
46:47 they end up burning the air molecules
46:49 instantaneously at a microscopic level
46:52 and then another laser projects onto the
46:55 burn packet of
46:56 air thus creating light and because it
46:58 is a burned
47:00 combustion in the room at a microscopic
47:02 level
47:04 it's opaque so you can't see through it
47:06 and that's supposedly how they're
47:09 trying to create those holographic
47:11 tables that you see in all the sci-fi
47:13 movies so that the military can have
47:15 you know something spin around
47:19 all right let's take that in your brain
47:22 two things colliding create a state
47:25 of which you can finally see the laser
47:29 lasers in general any of you have seen a
47:31 laser at an amusement park
47:33 you got one in your house you're trying
47:34 to make it visible
47:36 you know that when you shine on the
47:38 ground to get your cat running around
47:40 you don't see the path from the laser
47:42 beam
47:43 pointer to the ground unless
47:47 someone's smoking a big fat cigar in the
47:49 room or you got a smoke machine
47:50 or you're outside and it's foggy then
47:53 you can see it
47:55 well let's play this back and look at it
47:57 from a century standpoint
48:00 why do you see anything at all you see
48:03 something because of vibration
48:05 in the in the soup of ether the ripples
48:09 in the pond when you throw the rock into
48:10 the pond and ripples come back
48:12 in a perfect circle
48:16 those ripples hit the rods and cones in
48:18 your eye
48:19 and manifest an electrical pattern that
48:23 gets beamed back to your brain upside
48:24 down and backwards and your brain sorts
48:26 it out so you can see something
48:28 why do you see colors well different
48:30 frequencies registers different colors
48:32 and
48:34 thank god human beings have agreed on
48:37 what color palettes are
48:38 for the most part there are some color
48:40 blind folks out there
48:42 which i think is very interesting we
48:44 have color blind folks
48:46 i don't think anything's wrong with them
48:47 they might actually be seeing more who
48:49 knows
48:50 they don't see uh perhaps vibrance but
48:52 they might see hues you know you never
48:54 know or contrast way better than we do
48:56 never know
48:57 so it's all these things working
48:59 together that are creating any form of
49:01 your senses
49:02 if i touched your hand with my finger
49:06 well you your brain which is inside your
49:09 head is telling you
49:11 that there's they have a holographic
49:12 representation of your body
49:14 inside your brain that actually touched
49:16 you way down there in the tip of your
49:17 finger
49:18 but you don't actually have a brain in
49:19 your finger your brain is telling your
49:22 consciousness
49:23 that you have instrumentalities
49:26 usually ten fingers and ten toes and
49:28 some torso and arms and legs
49:30 and it's happening at exactly where i'm
49:32 touching you
49:34 we know from amputees they still feel
49:36 their limbs for quite a while
49:39 all right what is the very fabric of
49:42 this universe is nothing
49:44 more than a bunch of collisions giving
49:46 us the
49:47 impression that we have a universe
49:50 what is the big problem with conceiving
49:52 of the universe
49:54 well the big problem is we can't
49:57 understand it it seems to be infinite
49:59 we're looking out at the sky and it's
50:00 like how far does that go
50:02 the thing i mentioned in the day in an
50:04 episode which is well
50:06 how do you keep everything from floating
50:07 away that's why they created this
50:10 pull gravity theory which is a
50:12 phenomenon
50:14 well if you have a container what's a
50:16 container made out of
50:18 but what if all that doesn't matter
50:19 because this is all an illusion
50:22 created by a bunch of colliding energies
50:24 let's just call it energies
50:27 definitely not probably at the huge
50:30 upper construct of electrons and atoms
50:33 it
50:33 must go way down below that
50:38 but here we are this super construct
50:41 as a human being within this crazy
50:44 mishmash of colliding
50:48 dimensions of existence of colliding
50:51 energies
50:52 forces
50:55 when someone tells you that you know
50:57 your emotions don't exist
51:00 the interesting thing about when someone
51:02 tells you that these things are real
51:05 is that when you dream like i've been
51:07 saying
51:10 or you don't have to dream you don't
51:11 have to go all the way into a theta
51:14 state or you know whatever frequency
51:18 that you want to blame on dreaming
51:20 you can sit here and daydream they dream
51:24 all the time
51:25 those things that you want that you
51:26 don't have
51:29 you know what you would do if you had
51:30 that car or that girl that guy or that
51:33 money or whatever
51:34 you can dream right away inside your
51:36 brain
51:40 and you can see it pretty real inside
51:42 your brain without jumping into a dream
51:45 but how's that possible how's it
51:48 possible that you have this capability
51:49 of having this little
51:51 synthesizing you know reality machine
51:53 inside your brain
51:56 i don't know sure seems to me like it's
51:59 all made of the same thing
52:00 isn't it but merely because we climb
52:03 into this suit
52:05 as douglas adams would say this monkey
52:07 suit
52:09 and we are temporarily human for one
52:12 particular
52:13 blip in our existence this one's real
52:17 and everything else is fake
52:20 really
52:23 uh let me give you another thought
52:26 process
52:28 you're with your lover
52:31 and your lover does something really
52:32 wonderful perhaps they just say
52:34 something to you
52:36 they say something to you they just
52:37 light you on fire
52:39 in a good way they make you feel loved
52:43 they make you feel aroused for whatever
52:45 reason
52:47 what's interesting about arousal is that
52:50 you know that you know there's the old
52:52 saying about the anticipation of the
52:54 kiss
52:55 sometimes more intense than the actual
52:56 kiss itself
52:58 but sometimes it's that perfect someone
53:01 just saying this simplest little thing
53:04 which says i love you and when we get
53:06 home
53:07 i'm tearing you apart and it's just an
53:09 amazing feeling but it's almost
53:11 nothing you could say in front of your
53:12 preacher and they wouldn't even know
53:14 what you're talking about
53:16 subtleties all right well
53:20 you're in this body and what's the
53:22 difference between
53:23 your imagination for something you could
53:26 imagine something and feel wonderful
53:29 there are folks that claim that they
53:31 study before they play the lottery
53:33 and imagine that they've won like the
53:36 guys that practice
53:37 basketball free throws for real life
53:41 and then a group that goes home and
53:43 imagines for hours
53:45 inside their mind that they're throwing
53:46 swish after swish after swish
53:49 and then the third group which is the
53:50 control group that doesn't either they
53:52 don't practice and they don't imagine
53:55 when they bring the three groups
53:56 together obviously the ones that really
53:58 practice hard they're the best
54:00 but the second group is just right
54:02 behind them and the third group is just
54:04 fumbling all over the place
54:07 the human body is a high degree of
54:10 of what we are acknowledging as
54:13 realities
54:14 they always tell us we have five senses
54:16 right and of course they make movies of
54:18 like sixth sense and they'll
54:20 write articles like you know can you get
54:22 in touch with your sixth sense and
54:24 it really limits your mind's perception
54:27 of reality well i guess i only have five
54:30 i shouldn't even look for anything else
54:32 but those who are open-minded in this
54:34 world
54:34 tend to have more paranormal experiences
54:37 than any other group on planet earth
54:40 why because they're truly enlightened in
54:43 my opinion
54:44 they see more that is the definition of
54:47 being enlightened
54:48 that's why it blows my mind that people
54:50 don't talk about dreaming much
54:53 i mean how many out of eight billion
54:56 people roughly on this planet
54:58 how many are having vivid dreams every
55:00 night
55:01 like i said in a previous episode i
55:03 interview my friends about dreaming
55:05 and it's interesting those that don't
55:06 dream uh it's pretty bland
55:09 conversation of course but those that do
55:13 dream
55:14 will suddenly light up because they're
55:16 like oh
55:17 are you going to talk about dreaming oh
55:18 gosh you know i had this dream
55:21 it's uh 4 17 in the morning so people
55:24 are starting to wake up here
55:27 but they get into dreams and they'll say
55:28 things right off the bat they'll one of
55:30 the most common phrases i get out of
55:32 people
55:33 who remember their dreams or or they
55:36 don't typically remember their dreams
55:38 but they have a few doozies and they'll
55:39 the what's funny is the archetype of
55:41 them acknowledging their dreams
55:43 is nah i don't dream that much you know
55:46 well there was this one dream and then
55:48 they go it was just like i remember just
55:51 like it was yesterday
55:52 so the funny thing is they negate
55:54 themselves with this almost
55:56 self-deprecating sentence
55:59 and then as soon as they remember that
56:01 one dream that they remember the second
56:03 dream the third day and the fourth dream
56:04 and they remember
56:06 usually a nightmare is something that
56:07 someone can remember and it's usually
56:09 when they were a little kid
56:11 and sometimes it's really silly things
56:15 sometimes it's very vivid i'm gonna
56:19 recap something with you guys and the og
56:21 listeners bear with me there's a point
56:23 to me repeating this
56:26 i've done so many episodes i feel
56:27 obligated to prove i don't have
56:29 alzheimer's
56:30 or that i'm biting my own content
56:32 without acknowledgement
56:35 i i started my dad scared the crap out
56:38 of me when i was a kid he thought it was
56:39 funny he was a really young father
56:41 so by the time i was four he was just
56:43 27.
56:45 but for whatever reason man i don't know
56:48 just immature i think but he'd let me
56:50 watch a really scary movie
56:52 from back in the 50s to like that little
56:55 [ __ ] african doll with the knife that
56:57 ran after that woman in the 70s and then
57:00 then he would try to recreate it that
57:02 night for me so i would be an absolute
57:04 horror
57:04 and so i started having tons of
57:07 nightmares as a kid
57:09 my toys coming after me this word
57:11 mannequin chick attacking me
57:12 and this stuff went on from at least the
57:14 age of probably
57:16 three or four all the way up to seven
57:18 when i finally just said i'm
57:20 i'm done with this and i defeated this
57:22 recurring mannequin
57:24 chick that was always terrorizing me
57:26 here's the thing
57:28 the reason why i'm bringing them back up
57:29 again is i'm starting to suspect that
57:31 that
57:32 might have really augmented my mind
57:35 and it really i think made me very
57:37 independent as a human being because
57:39 when you're in these
57:40 nightmares who's not there i don't
57:43 remember
57:43 anyone telling me you tell me if you've
57:45 had this archetype you have a nightmare
57:47 it's reoccurring and dad comes in and
57:49 saves you in your nightmare mom comes in
57:51 and saves you and your superman comes in
57:53 and saves you in your nightmare
57:54 i've never heard that if you've had that
57:56 experience please share it
57:58 because i never had anyone help me in my
58:00 dreams
58:01 i'm on my own hey kid get tired of this
58:04 crap
58:05 you've been dreaming about this broad
58:06 for three to four years
58:09 hey you have to nut up and kick your ass
58:11 that's exactly what i did
58:13 and i remember in real life i went from
58:17 allowing kids to bully me allowing kids
58:20 to lead me
58:22 to being oh gee
58:25 you know just like i run my life you
58:27 want to be with me that's fine we're
58:28 going to do what i want to do
58:29 i guarantee you this will be interesting
58:31 you don't go screw yourself get out of
58:33 my face
58:34 that's just the way i was by the time i
58:35 was nine years old i was a little baller
58:37 man
58:39 dreams are super important your
58:41 imagination is super important
58:43 and this reality is super important to
58:45 be put side by side and i want you to
58:48 measure
58:50 and acknowledge if you agree with me
58:56 that these are semblances of them of
58:58 each other
59:00 you simply have reduced states of
59:03 sensory input because
59:05 one you one occurs inside your body
59:08 and so you got this vessel that will
59:10 report hey that's really hot you're
59:12 burning you know
59:13 and the other one you don't have any
59:15 feeling inside of a dream i am unaware
59:18 of really feeling tactile things i think
59:21 the times that i have felt something in
59:22 my dream perhaps something was touching
59:24 me in real life
59:25 i told you guys once that i had a dream
59:27 of being in this room
59:29 and a zombie came up and breathed on my
59:32 neck
59:33 and i knew he was in the room i thought
59:35 it was kind of funny
59:36 because in my dreams when a monster
59:38 shows up nowadays i just say uh
59:40 i'm gonna rip this dude apart if i need
59:42 to but let's just see what he does and
59:44 that's what i did i
59:45 i remember lying down i was kind of
59:46 smiling in my dream and
59:48 i felt him come up to me and i could
59:50 just hear his gurgling
59:52 throat and he was like and he was like
59:54 whatever it was and
59:56 i thought well let's see if he bites me
59:58 because i i think i went lucid
60:00 to the point i was like i want to see if
60:01 i can feel this dude and what i felt was
60:04 a super cold breath on my neck
60:07 well i immediately kind of like giggled
60:10 and squirmed or whatever and i woke up
60:13 and i found out that my neck was exposed
60:16 to the room and the room
60:17 unfortunately was like out here 44
60:19 degrees it was really
60:20 i don't know wasn't 44 but it's really
60:22 cold and then i turned the heater up and
60:24 went back to bed
60:26 we i think have
60:30 plenty of empirical evidence right
60:31 before our very eyes
60:33 that potentially this reality is a
60:35 massive collision
60:36 of not just the stuff that's tangible to
60:38 all of our machines today
60:41 but of a whole bunch of different
60:45 elements of acknowledgeable reality
60:50 what do i mean by that well obviously we
60:52 have some tangible mass we're dealing
60:54 with here
60:55 but but you know if i ask you
60:59 what is the what do you want out of life
61:02 you know ask you that question what do
61:04 you want in life what's your purpose in
61:05 life
61:08 you know i just watched an interview
61:09 with little richard on david letterman
61:11 way back i guess from the 90s
61:13 maybe it was the 80s yeah it's probably
61:14 the 80s
61:16 he said i want to get famous because i
61:17 wanted to buy a big cadillac some dude
61:19 in my town had a really long stretch
61:22 red cadillac and that's why i wanted to
61:24 get famous just to get my cadillac
61:27 now he was saying that because he had
61:29 evolved as a man
61:30 and got to a point where he realized
61:32 that was not the most important thing in
61:33 the world
61:34 most folks say to some degree in some
61:39 form of communication i want to be happy
61:42 and if i can make other people happy at
61:44 the same time i'm making myself happy
61:47 then i have won the jackpot of life
61:51 okay well what is happy
61:54 i mean what is it here's a jar put happy
61:56 in there go ahead do it for me
61:59 guarantee you ain't a car it's not a
62:01 house
62:03 that might play host to your happiness
62:07 but unless you're doing something
62:09 interesting with those devices
62:13 you're not going to be happy if you have
62:15 ever been
62:16 really wealthy in your life and now
62:17 you're much more down to reality you're
62:19 living within your means
62:22 and you're totally thrilled to death
62:24 with
62:25 virtually nothing in your life very few
62:27 possessions you got a good roof over
62:29 your head
62:30 you got transportation you got decent
62:31 food
62:33 and you're just so happy you can sit by
62:36 the fire and open a book and just crawl
62:38 into charles dickens men or whatever you
62:40 like
62:42 you'll realize this as you get older the
62:44 more subtle things in life are what it's
62:46 all about
62:48 and if we could just get our kids as a
62:50 digression statement here if we could
62:52 just get our kids to realize that when
62:53 they're young oh my god just like how
62:55 rich our kids would be
62:56 monetarily speaking but also spiritually
63:00 it's funny when you date one of the uh
63:05 things you went into the more you get
63:06 older and and one of the beautiful
63:09 things that can happen is
63:11 as you're younger you're thinking about
63:12 oh if you're a dude and you're straight
63:14 you like girls
63:16 then you're like oh gosh i gotta find a
63:17 girl that doesn't want more stuff that i
63:20 can afford to give her
63:22 those that try to supply the one that
63:26 wants everything well they end up very
63:28 unhappy broke and divorced typically
63:30 as you get older you will run into
63:35 partners that you would potentially pick
63:37 who are still
63:38 on that childish thing they're still
63:41 trying to get that one payoff
63:43 and so neither one of you can be happy
63:44 because nothing is really tangible and
63:48 real right
63:53 i bring that up just to massage your
63:55 mind into the appreciation of the
63:57 subtleties
63:58 of our existence because that's a theme
64:02 i think in trying to acknowledge what is
64:04 reality
64:06 i think to get back to the core subject
64:10 here
64:12 the big question i have for myself and
64:14 now i'm going to be observing things a
64:16 little bit differently as i kind of go
64:17 through this
64:18 experiment i wanted to share it with you
64:21 so we can
64:22 start doing this if you're not already
64:23 doing it perhaps you're the guru on it
64:25 and i'm
64:26 i'm your student is to look for
64:30 sort of atypical
64:33 turns in the script now you're going
64:36 down the street and all of a sudden poof
64:37 something different happens
64:40 it doesn't mean a car accident or
64:41 anything but you're in the streets not
64:43 real but i mean
64:44 life is going one way you think your
64:46 life's going to turn out one way
64:47 and then suddenly poof something changes
64:50 you have an epiphany
64:51 you have an enlightenment it could be
64:54 enlightenment through something good
64:55 could be an enlightenment through
64:56 something bad you have a near-death
64:57 experience and so you pop out and all of
64:59 a sudden you can see
65:01 roses everywhere i have a good friend of
65:03 mine
65:04 that i mentioned earlier this year
65:08 in season five he had a stroke last year
65:13 and you know he was out of it for a
65:15 while he was completely out of it for
65:17 several months
65:18 meaning he doesn't remember those months
65:20 even though we all came to visit him
65:22 might have been the medication not sure
65:25 now he's completely kicking butt and
65:26 taking names man and he
65:28 took his rehabilitation seriously and
65:29 he's walking now
65:31 it's fantastic because he was in bad
65:33 shape man
65:36 he is now looking at the world
65:39 completely different
65:41 he is now more interested in the subject
65:43 matter that we talk about
65:45 he's not prepared at all to to really
65:47 ingest what we talk about
65:49 because he's off on the official science
65:51 thing he calls me up and just starts
65:54 going in these it's very endearing and
65:56 wonderful but he starts telling me all
65:58 about
65:59 you know black holes and the big bang
66:01 and all this other stuff as if i'm not
66:02 an expert on it already which is really
66:04 funny
66:04 and he knows i'm an expert on this stuff
66:06 so i'm sitting there going
66:08 dude okay hey i don't want to hear this
66:10 crap it's all propaganda
66:12 you should really if you want to have
66:13 your mind really blown watch a couple of
66:15 my episodes and then go research this
66:17 stuff and then
66:18 find out he's a huge tesla fan but he's
66:21 sort of one of those
66:22 tesla groupies that doesn't want to get
66:23 into anything that tesla actually did
66:25 he just wants to seem intelligent
66:27 because he likes tesla god bless him
66:29 but that's the truth but that near-death
66:33 experience for him
66:36 it woke him up it completely woke him up
66:40 we don't want to have to necessarily go
66:42 through those experiences to see
66:43 something wonderful occur
66:45 in my opinion again
66:48 if we had a good university
66:52 one on planet earth because i don't know
66:54 if there is one
66:55 on planet earth where we could bring in
66:58 the meticulous
67:00 build a true curriculum we would need
67:03 buildings i mean we would need
67:06 divisions of research and then we would
67:09 have yearly summits or maybe every you
67:11 know quarterly summits to bring
67:13 hemispheres of thought together that
67:15 don't typically come together
67:17 to see if there are correlations and we
67:20 should expect that there aren't any
67:21 correlations such that if we find one
67:24 maybe something interesting is going on
67:26 right
67:28 and i'll give you kind of a what if
67:31 and then we'll get back on this thing
67:33 but this is again
67:34 more of an exercise of opening your mind
67:38 to the possibility of what reality is
67:42 and and abstracting it tremendously
67:45 to what it might truly be because again
67:48 my
67:48 human minds are very finite and we
67:51 typically only feel comfortable if we
67:53 live well within the means of what
67:56 logic loops we have learned by ingesting
67:59 tons of
68:00 mind-numbing close-minded paradigms
68:04 but what if something is atypical as
68:08 we are searching for indications of
68:10 colliding realities
68:12 we want to see mandela effects happen
68:15 organically under the microscope
68:19 that's metaphorical of course and again
68:21 if somebody at the hadron colliders
68:23 figured out a way to crack it because
68:25 they truly are geniuses and not a bunch
68:26 of people living in the 60s science
68:28 that'd be great but imagine we
68:32 increase our enlightenment we increase
68:34 the
68:36 the particle per million that we can
68:39 view with our human eyes without
68:41 microscopes without machines
68:43 and we start to see a lot more in the
68:45 universe
68:47 well the minute we can start doing that
68:49 we can start isolating more variables in
68:51 the universe
68:52 and thus distill from the universe far
68:55 more
68:55 invention and creativity than we ever
68:58 thought possible before
69:01 for instance what if this exercise
69:04 in a university that's properly
69:06 organized with
69:07 with true charters and thought where
69:09 people are coming into rooms
69:11 understanding leave everything that you
69:13 learned
69:13 from birth at the door and bring
69:17 everything into the room that you learn
69:18 while you were here
69:20 and with like-minded individuals who
69:21 carry that discipline outside the
69:23 university
69:25 and suddenly a bunch of us are in some
69:29 weird little conversation
69:31 we keep stringing things together you
69:34 know we're talking about colliding
69:35 realities and then we start talking
69:36 about the fabric of the universe and
69:38 how this could be created through again
69:41 collisions and things that make up sight
69:43 collisions of things that make up sound
69:45 and touch and emotion
69:46 and consciousness and then suddenly poof
69:49 we've got a zero-point energy system
69:52 figured out because all the sudden
69:56 how to harness the energy right out of
69:58 the universe becomes
70:00 so obvious because we lifted off
70:04 all these onion layers of control
70:07 of stagnation for me it's just
70:11 a frontier that is absolutely phenomenal
70:14 interesting
70:15 amazing and what's nice about this
70:18 entire discipline of thinking
70:21 is that it keeps you young it doesn't
70:24 matter how old your physical body is
70:27 we know that thinking and solving
70:29 problems
70:30 and investigating and connecting and
70:32 deducing
70:33 is what creates new brain cells flushes
70:36 out the old ones
70:38 can you imagine you ingest some
70:42 vaccination
70:43 which numbs your brain
70:46 and therefore you don't make any new
70:48 brain cells so whatever you got when you
70:50 got that vaccination
70:53 it's done whatever you got to what you
70:55 got
70:56 and so thinking becomes more difficult
70:59 becomes self-defeating
71:00 becomes depressing but you get into a
71:04 really cool university of thought
71:08 where you come in imagine us i'm in my
71:10 50s right
71:12 you get the older folks like myself
71:15 with you know a whole range of folks but
71:18 you
71:18 it won't matter how old you are that's
71:20 the nice thing so if you're young and
71:22 you think like this
71:23 and man you've already won let me just
71:25 tell you
71:26 but we bring in kids that haven't
71:28 thought this way but they have this
71:31 desire to see more
71:35 they have this sort of pent up tension
71:37 in their soul because
71:38 they are more open-minded and thus they
71:40 are getting these little
71:42 montages and collages of epiphanies and
71:45 inventions but they don't know how to
71:47 sort it out
71:49 and they walk into our little club of
71:52 thought
71:53 and it's like there it is kid there's
71:56 all the cognitive sciences you could
71:57 ever use to continue expanding your
71:59 brain
72:00 and there's a division for dreams over
72:02 there there's a division of ethereal
72:04 sciences
72:04 there's a zero point energy wing over
72:06 there there's a supernatural
72:08 over there i mean it's just on and on
72:10 and on
72:12 and they're coming in fresh they're
72:13 coming in young they're going to turn
72:15 into a professor at this college
72:16 because instead of stagnating at a
72:18 university as a
72:20 lazy 10-year professor they know that
72:23 the job
72:24 entails continually evolving they expect
72:27 to be teaching something different in
72:29 five years and then five years from that
72:30 may be something completely different
72:32 maybe they transfer between divisions
72:34 because they're like you know what
72:35 i was in the ethereal division and we
72:37 had the zero point energy
72:39 advancement so i followed that
72:41 advancement to the zero point energy
72:42 division
72:43 to to help
72:47 aren't universities partly
72:52 exhilarating and partly incredibly
72:54 boring
72:56 you know my kid's a teacher and she said
72:59 something brilliant
73:00 a few months ago and we talked about it
73:03 she said that you know
73:04 i'm i'm very knowledgeable and i'm very
73:07 engaging to my students but she said i
73:09 can feel when i go in and observe a
73:11 senior teacher
73:13 they have their shtick they have their
73:16 their method of evolving
73:19 you know one link to the other link to
73:21 the other thing to pass the knowledge
73:23 on to the kids and she says that's what
73:26 i have to develop and i will develop
73:28 she's developing it every day of course
73:30 but she's
73:31 going to evolve her ability to become
73:33 the greatest teacher she can possibly be
73:35 in her lifetime
73:38 and this is her like second year
73:40 teaching
73:41 this is phenomenal that she's uh already
73:43 on to that and i didn't say anything
73:45 she just did it by herself that's cool
73:48 she's got a bright future
73:50 but i've been to you know colleges where
73:53 i've spoke
73:55 you know berkeley and uci
73:58 and a bunch of other ones
74:02 and i've been into engineering schools
74:04 and they do have divisions that create
74:06 interesting projects for kids that are
74:08 just phenomenal some great schools don't
74:10 mean to say anything disparaging
74:11 i'm not qualified to say anything
74:13 disparaging but what i never
74:15 feel having and i never went to harvard
74:18 or sorry excuse me i never went to
74:19 stanford
74:20 to go to school but when i would talk to
74:24 individuals that do talked to some of
74:27 the
74:28 professors there they were always
74:30 working on something interesting but
74:31 they weren't
74:33 ever mentioning a situation where a
74:35 division a separate division
74:37 would work with their division to get
74:38 something done i'm sure that happens
74:42 that should be the way it is structured
74:44 from the very beginning
74:46 i think one of the kisses of death that
74:49 happens to a university and i only
74:50 realize this
74:51 much much later in life as if a
74:54 particular university becomes famous for
74:56 a particular discovery
74:58 they hang on to it like it's you know
75:01 money and if the theory gets deprecated
75:05 in time
75:06 they will put money in to bully you
75:09 out of your theory you know someone
75:12 asked me if i had discussed string
75:14 theory
75:16 and my string theory background was a
75:20 very when it came out i bought two or
75:22 three books on it because i was involved
75:23 in this book club where i was getting
75:25 at least a book a month and i would
75:27 always buy two more
75:31 but the literature on it was very
75:32 minimal
75:34 and i read through it and i thought well
75:37 for me i was getting a
75:39 very strong vibe of this is simply not
75:42 the way it works
75:45 it seemed like a very creative solution
75:49 to explain things which i think is a
75:52 beautiful thing
75:52 maybe we'll find out there's some
75:54 element of it i do think there's
75:55 elements of it
75:56 that are probably playing a role in the
75:59 universe
76:00 in terms of how things vibrate into
76:02 existence
76:04 but that dude was so attacked by the
76:08 academics of his time i remember
76:12 i was a big subscriber of scientific
76:13 american at the time
76:15 and just the hit pieces on this guy was
76:18 really unprecedented and immature and
76:21 unfortunate
76:22 that it was like uh we don't like you so
76:24 you're out of here
76:25 not proving anything just simply
76:29 criticizing this guy
76:31 i think we have to break that mold
76:35 what are some of the other things that
76:36 might be participating or sorry might be
76:38 indicators of a colliding universe
76:41 well we know that we have moods
76:44 that we get in right sometimes we get in
76:47 moods where
76:49 it seems almost spontaneous uh like we
76:53 have
76:54 an angry spell something could be
76:57 colliding with our universe to affect
76:59 our
77:00 our our chemical structure in our brain
77:04 let's just give you an example of why
77:06 this could be the case
77:09 let's say that the universe collides and
77:12 changes
77:12 an atom or two or a million in your
77:16 arm then you get that little flicker in
77:18 your muscle and you're like wow that's
77:20 crazy look at my muzzle man it's
77:21 flickering all by itself
77:23 and you just swap whatever yeah but now
77:25 let's say that happens inside your brain
77:28 oh we don't want that kind of stuff
77:29 happening inside of our brain right
77:31 your eye your eyelid you know flickers
77:33 like that or something out of thin air
77:36 probably the cell phones are what was
77:39 the deal with the texas
77:41 tower shooter
77:44 the guy's at the texas university and he
77:46 gets up on a tower and he's got this
77:48 i think an m1 rifle and he is just sharp
77:51 shooting people on the ground they
77:52 didn't even know where the hell the guy
77:53 was
77:54 until someone went oh my god it's a dude
77:55 up there
77:57 and when they got rid of him and did an
78:00 autopsy on his body
78:02 he had a tumor pushing on his brain
78:06 and this has been something that we have
78:07 seen several times people are
78:09 gigantic people with people who are
78:12 sometimes small
78:13 there's all kinds of things when you get
78:14 little tumors in your brain
78:17 it's pushing on your mechanics it's
78:18 changing things
78:20 okay well that's very in your face
78:23 but at least that gives you a little
78:25 cause and effect connection in your
78:26 brain
78:27 i mean in your brain we're all talking
78:28 about brains here but it gives you a
78:30 cause and effect connection model
78:32 of don't mess with that thing
78:36 because that's your liaison mechanic
78:40 that your soul is trying to use to
78:42 create a consciousness
78:44 consciousness so you can enter this
78:46 reality and survive
78:49 and not be a sharpshooter of people but
78:51 if you ever woke up one day and you feel
78:53 depressed for some reason
78:54 outside of any you know thing that
78:57 they're holding us down for
79:00 some days you'll feel totally euphoric
79:03 and some of you might think it's your
79:04 coffee or the lack thereof
79:07 but there'll be a moment when all that's
79:08 taken care of and you just kind of
79:10 feel weird or the funny one is that when
79:14 i was in the midwest everyone had a
79:15 barometer on their wall
79:18 you know the air pressure and there's a
79:22 lot of wisdom that we have lost about
79:24 barometers and barometers were huge
79:26 it would tell you whether i was going to
79:28 be human or not with a low pressure
79:30 system over the house
79:31 it could rain but there was also
79:35 as i remember it a lot of links to human
79:37 behavior
79:39 you know they say that a full moon makes
79:40 people change their behaviors
79:43 well in my opinion the reason why crime
79:45 goes up on a full moon is that the
79:46 criminals can see what the hell they're
79:48 doing
79:48 i think that's one of the things i've
79:50 never heard asserted and i thought
79:51 that's a pretty stupid
79:53 or shallow perspective on that thing
79:56 perhaps the moon being full and
79:59 projecting a bunch of light
80:00 maybe creates more impacts who knows
80:04 what if just a little bit of chemical
80:06 structure in your body is getting
80:07 changed every once in a while
80:08 radically because it's impacting occurs
80:12 all the time
80:13 it occurs in every xyz in your body
80:15 constantly
80:17 why do some people have premonitions
80:21 what would be a premonition it's a
80:22 prediction of the future
80:25 okay so impacts are occurring constantly
80:28 if you've ever seen a star trek episode
80:29 where you've got some vortex or some
80:32 wormhole where they're trying to get the
80:34 voyager back to
80:35 earth a little faster it's it's an
80:38 einstein-rosen bridge
80:40 you go through this thing and you jump
80:44 like a hyperspace and a fold in the
80:47 universe you get to travel
80:49 much further distance and a shorter path
80:53 okay so what if this collision
80:56 system is merely opening
81:00 up a perceptive whole where
81:03 the consciousness energy from that
81:05 future not the event itself
81:07 none of the light particles or anything
81:09 from that future event are coming
81:10 through the hole and going into your eye
81:12 thus being registered in your in your
81:14 real visual cortex
81:16 but you have this mind's eye view of
81:18 what's going on
81:23 well let's just take my little
81:24 premonition before 9 11.
81:26 i told my girlfriend i'm sorry i keep
81:28 repeating this it's gonna
81:30 sound more interesting in this
81:31 particular example but i thought
81:32 something bad was about to happen
81:34 and then i saw planes and i said i think
81:37 it has to do with planes
81:38 the night before man f
81:41 you know i don't need attention i got
81:43 plenty of tension in the world i want
81:45 less attention
81:45 okay if an event like that occurs
81:50 which it did the next day how many
81:54 souls were screaming
81:58 at that event hence consciousness
82:02 screaming people going oh my god
82:06 let alone the people that may have
82:07 perished that day
82:10 so the impacts are occurring creating
82:12 these vortexes because that's what
82:13 impacts do
82:14 that's all ethereal matter stirs around
82:16 the universe and creates
82:18 slower moving constructs that we call
82:21 atoms
82:22 in this particular case i was sitting in
82:24 a bed just really relaxing my mind
82:27 approaching the stage where i'm going to
82:30 get into twilight zone
82:32 and all these voices are screaming
82:35 so the tiniest aperture from the next
82:37 day
82:38 opens up and all this consciousness
82:41 comes streaming to me
82:43 and even a scream of ten thousand souls
82:46 let alone
82:47 a billion souls that screamed that day
82:51 it just is a little tiny infinitesimal
82:54 eye drop
82:55 that falls into my world and it has
82:58 enough
82:59 information that i'm able to discern it
83:02 being bad
83:03 and then because the press
83:07 showed us these videos of planes that
83:10 was part of the consciousness stream
83:11 and part of the packet transfer to me
83:14 and all i did was take it in
83:16 didn't know where to put it and i
83:18 blurted it out in words
83:20 very important man when you think you
83:21 have a premonition to get it written
83:23 down
83:24 oh how i wish we would have had cell
83:26 phones with cameras on them i would have
83:28 done a selfie video and said that in the
83:30 camera
83:31 and then with my consciousness now
83:35 and it would have been this amazing
83:36 thing for all of us to witness
83:39 so that for me is just scratching the
83:42 surface of this theory
83:44 that perhaps this is a
83:48 big cluster of realities
83:51 it is impacting potentially at every
83:53 point in space and time
83:56 it could be that if i was standing 10
83:58 feet back i would have got a different
83:59 message tonight than the one i got
84:00 sitting right here
84:02 but let me give you like a ridiculous
84:04 one
84:06 i sit in the same place on my patio
84:08 every time i do an episode i've been
84:09 doing it for five
84:10 plus years in fact this
84:13 little porcelain thing that used to be
84:15 in the intro
84:16 has been sitting in that same spot for
84:18 so long that there's a stain underneath
84:21 it and so i know exactly where to put
84:22 that i'll move it around a little bit
84:23 when friends come over
84:24 but when i want to know where my chair
84:26 goes i put the porcelain thing back over
84:28 at the stain it's a little round
84:30 rectangle on the bottom
84:31 and another chair comes back so far
84:33 because the camera's got to fit in there
84:35 and i'm always at the same place the
84:36 entire time i do these
84:38 episodes and i'm smoking tobacco
84:42 not paper with goo on it and a filter
84:44 but real tobacco
84:46 unchemically treated
84:49 and so my mind is is got a really
84:52 low wave or yeah it's a low wave it's a
84:56 low sine wave that's what tobacco does
84:58 to you it smoothes out your brain
85:00 and it makes you very philosophical it's
85:03 an amazing thing the conversations you
85:04 have in a smoke lounge that you'll never
85:06 get anywhere else
85:08 but let me just give you this idea have
85:11 you ever had a chair
85:12 in the house that you bought and it was
85:14 a leather chair
85:17 doesn't have to be a leather chair but
85:18 leather chairs the best ones to talk
85:20 about this
85:21 it's essentially anything with a cushion
85:22 pad in it
85:25 and you sit in that chair so much and
85:27 everyone else sits in a tube
85:29 but if it's just you know it's grandpa's
85:31 chair and grandpa's butt
85:33 as a size and his butt pad
85:37 pushes down on the cushion and even when
85:39 the grandpa's not there after 10 years
85:41 you can see grandpa's butt right there
85:42 in that chair
85:44 don't sit in a chair it's grandpa's
85:45 chair your butt's not big enough for
85:47 that chair
85:49 or if you do sit in and you're like oh
85:51 this is all like you know
85:53 it's all shape for butts
85:57 what if me sitting here on this on this
85:59 patio
86:01 is ceremoniously through repetition
86:05 training this particular part of the
86:07 universe to be a siphon
86:10 that if there's any consciousness
86:11 participating in this show
86:14 gifting me with epiphanies as i'm
86:15 talking to you which many have occurred
86:17 on the show
86:20 that this is sort of like a a little
86:22 temple you know
86:23 the the wave comes in and it trains this
86:26 area right here
86:28 to be the area where ideas come from my
86:30 buddies come and
86:31 we smoke together on the patio they have
86:34 the greatest time of their life
86:36 and having a real conversation when my
86:38 buddies comes over
86:40 it's a little less now since it's really
86:42 cold out but he'll say you know it's so
86:44 nice to have a real conversation for a
86:46 change because the guy's super smart
86:48 and everywhere he goes it's you know
86:50 politics or something else
86:52 trivial and trite and we talk about
86:54 everything the bible we talk about
86:56 reality and dream everything we talk
86:58 about on the show
86:59 i get to practice on him it's pretty
87:00 funny he is responsible for several
87:02 episodes at this point
87:05 hyper narcissism was his phrase
87:09 well think about all the temples that
87:11 are out there in the world
87:13 where special things occur because
87:15 tibetan monks are sitting there thinking
87:17 about reality
87:19 they make their home on the top of a
87:20 hill isolated away from the rest of the
87:23 congestion
87:24 of thought the trite is filtered out
87:28 and they're going deeper into the self
87:31 but then any other human beings on
87:33 planet earth
87:33 plus there's dozens and dozens of them
87:36 resonating
87:38 with some grand enlightened guy
87:41 running the joint per temple what's a
87:45 big principle of kung fu
87:47 controlling the chi which is merely a
87:51 chinese equivalent of what we call ether
87:54 when they're doing all those hand
87:55 gestures before they do the fight
87:59 they're charging their body with the
88:01 energy of the universe such that when
88:03 they throw the first punch
88:05 it's got the energy of the universe
88:06 stuffed in their body waiting to come
88:08 out
88:09 in a fist punch or in a one-finger
88:11 push-up
88:12 or they're using their fingers to
88:14 penetrate leather
88:16 punch a rock in half whatever they're
88:18 doing right
88:20 we don't acknowledge their
88:24 thousand multi thousand year tradition
88:27 as having any reality odds those crazy
88:29 guys up in the hill
88:31 isn't that convenient well you don't
88:33 have to learn anything because you just
88:34 pissed on them yeah i don't think you do
88:37 that
88:39 some of you have moved around the world
88:42 i've never asked one of our listeners
88:43 who's over in china
88:45 but maybe maybe uh part of his journey
88:48 was to
88:49 feel another culture to learn something
88:52 that wasn't taught where he grew up
88:54 for those of you who've moved around a
88:55 lot you let me know if you've ever
88:57 traveled to another culture and then
89:00 just been blown away
89:02 by just the incidental knowledge that
89:04 was there
89:05 so anyway this stuff is really
89:07 interesting to me hopefully you found
89:09 this uh
89:10 a good exercise for your mind please
89:12 chime in
89:13 please let me know what part of this you
89:16 dig
89:17 a part of this you might have
89:18 experienced
89:20 elements of collisions things that you
89:23 might have observed that could be a
89:24 collision
89:26 those little weird switcheroos that
89:28 happen
89:29 introductions of information which you
89:31 would have otherwise
89:32 never experienced anyway i think that's
89:36 about all i got for that
89:38 like i always say please go to
89:39 deepthoughtsradio.com and bookmark the
89:41 website just in case we get pushed
89:43 around by some big tech censorship
89:46 we'll always be up on bid shoot that's
89:48 the other equivalent of the video
89:51 there's an app for your phone by the way
89:53 and i think you can broadcast it to your
89:54 tv too
89:57 but anyway we have two video two audio
90:00 some social media
90:02 all new remastered season one a store
90:05 a couple ways to donate to this uh
90:07 movement it's been very very helpful for
90:09 those of you who have been
90:11 surrendering your hard-earned dollars i
90:12 hope i'm earning
90:14 every dollar for those of you who have i
90:16 just so appreciate it for those that
90:18 can't and you're just gifting me with
90:20 your presence
90:22 equal appreciation to you too anyway
