00:21 [Music]
00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentlemen on this beautiful day right
00:34 about 75 man I've waited forever not to
00:39 put a jacket on to do an episode today I
00:42 want to talk about something that I
00:43 guess it takes a little while you know
00:45 sometimes your mind to burp up a concept
00:48 you feel the frustration of it it's kind
00:51 of a comedian to do right they find all
00:53 the things that drive us nuts and make
00:54 jokes about them thank goodness I think
00:59 I'm gonna call this forced inhumanity
01:01 and I think you know you won't be
01:06 attracted to that title necessarily but
01:08 as soon as you hear what we're talking
01:10 about for any of you who consider
01:12 yourself to be awake or holistic and
01:19 you're sick and tired of people putting
01:21 stuff on you
01:22 this episodes for you so what is this
01:26 about this episode is about the lunacy
01:31 that is going on where the overwhelming
01:35 ignorance human beings of the world a
01:37 small slice of which I think are stupid
01:40 meaning they've been told where to find
01:43 the facts and they simply refuse and
01:45 when you refuse you move from the
01:48 ignorant pile to the stupid pile but
01:51 let's just say that you're a regular
01:53 watcher because this title is not that
01:55 enticing right so you're not gonna click
01:59 through if you know that I usually
02:01 deliver something we're thinking about
02:03 hopefully it's my goal so you're awake
02:07 you know all about toxins you know all
02:11 the things that they push on us
02:12 to make profit and then of course they
02:15 have engaged the social mores and the
02:18 social virtue signaling to protect their
02:22 industries pharmaceuticals shitty food
02:26 you know wireless technology
02:29 vaccinations all this stuff
02:35 and you know you and I know that it's
02:38 like look this stuff isn't good for us
02:40 Florida in our waters not good first
02:42 microwaves are good for us aluminum
02:44 shoved into the pores of our armpits so
02:47 that we don't sweat isn't good for us
02:50 eating a bunch of dead toxic food isn't
02:53 good for stress isn't good for us
02:56 homework for our kids isn't good for
02:58 them school is opening up really early
03:02 in the morning so your kid never has any
03:03 sleep not good for them kicking them out
03:07 at 2:30 in the afternoon so that you
03:09 have all your your daily schedule
03:13 completely interrupted because you got
03:14 to go how were you gonna work where you
03:17 can go I have to get off work and pick
03:18 my kid up they're not old enough to
03:20 drive I can't I've got five kids and I
03:22 can't afford to buy every one of them a
03:24 car etc etc not good for them you don't
03:28 get to meet your kid because your kid is
03:29 buried in books and as common core
03:33 teaches them how to be a [ __ ] and you
03:36 didn't you never learn common core you
03:37 can't even help them with their homework
03:39 you're supposed to vaccinate them with
03:41 28 vaccinations before they're 10 years
03:45 old a huge huge margin of them go into
03:50 convulsions the night of their
03:52 vaccinations and end up brain-damaged
03:55 which is then covered in a legal action
03:58 called autism autism is then blamed on
04:01 your genetics by rogue scientists who
04:04 are literally selling your kids down the
04:06 stream mentally damaged incapable of
04:10 attracting a mate incapable of spawning
04:14 so they can make a profit
04:17 pharmaceutical companies which are
04:19 gigantic can but camp campuses that take
04:22 a billion dollars or more to get a drug
04:25 through to take basically an herb from
04:28 the world that if you just eat it will
04:30 give you exactly the same indication as
04:33 they're synthesized herb with all the
04:36 side effects that kills you which takes
04:38 all kinds of clinical studies why do you
04:40 need clinical studies because it kills
04:42 people
04:42 that's why GMO foods which were created
04:46 and shoved into the food supply and nope
04:49 got notice no one got a pamphlet any of
04:52 you remember aleem this crazy GMO
04:57 Frankenstein goddamn thing that was put
04:59 into potato chips in the early 90s it
05:03 literally said on the bag might cause
05:04 loose stool I ate it I don't know if
05:08 Luce really itemizes the experience I
05:13 had I had a gut that went into cramps I
05:16 mean it was like I caught the flu for an
05:19 evening wireless technology
05:24 well wireless technology had been around
05:26 for a little while before cellphones you
05:29 know really made it a big deal but now
05:32 we've done a third generation network
05:33 fourth generation networking now we're
05:35 about to have the Holy apocalypse of
05:38 human extinction dropped on us called 5g
05:42 we know how the medical industry works
05:44 right because a lot of ignorant and
05:46 stupid people go well that was a danger
05:49 they wouldn't put it out there oh really
05:52 really mmm there's a profit margin in it
05:55 and they won't do it they won't go get
05:57 profit because they worry about you I
06:02 don't think so
06:03 have you ever been to any of the
06:05 neighborhoods in LA or in your
06:07 respective areas where all the
06:09 SuperDuper rich people live cell phones
06:12 don't work that well and you know why
06:14 they want their houses on the absolute
06:16 fringe of those towers I have friends in
06:20 LA and the surrounding communities and
06:23 where all the celebrities live their
06:25 cell phone reception sucks
06:27 I've got rich friends in Orange County
06:31 on these beautiful homes they can't get
06:34 a wireless router to work in their house
06:36 because their walls are anywhere between
06:38 a foot and a foot and a half thick
06:40 cinder blocks filled with sand stuccoed
06:45 such that RF waves do not penetrate the
06:48 home to make them ill water supplies mmm
06:54 water supplies that fluoride in them
06:56 don't they in a lot of places around the
06:59 world especially in America fluorine
07:02 which is floor
07:03 was considered an absolute toxin the
07:05 government paid out tons of you no
07:09 health harming lawsuits as the end of
07:13 the 40's because of all the people that
07:15 were exposed to fluorine during the
07:17 World War two rapid construction of all
07:20 of our war vehicles they were dumping
07:22 barrels underneath the San Francisco
07:24 Golden Gate Bridge the Army Corps of
07:26 Engineers telling us that the barrels
07:28 will last 50 years or so and then
07:30 they're going to deteriorate by the
07:31 salts and then they're just going to
07:33 simply diffuse into the water and four
07:35 years later or five years later in 1954
07:38 it was starting to be introduced into
07:41 our water supply as a medicine okay as
07:46 I've said several times in several
07:47 different shows they way you this I
07:49 could you go into a clinic for any
07:51 anything a cold the flu a broken arm
07:55 whatever because they want to find out
07:57 how much you weigh why do they do that
07:58 because they have to regulate the dosage
08:01 of any medical regiment they send you
08:03 home with to go to the pharmacy to get a
08:05 painkiller to get an antibiotic based on
08:07 your size and weight but nothing
08:10 stopping you from drinking infinite
08:12 water I know five foot one girls that
08:16 drink four times the water is a six foot
08:18 five guy over medicated with this docile
08:23 drug that rots your bones that rots your
08:26 brain that rots your teeth called
08:28 fluoride people ask me well if fluoride
08:32 is bad then why do dentists recommend it
08:34 I'm saying because it rots your [ __ ]
08:35 teeth that's why and what does the
08:37 dentist make money on a bunch of clean
08:39 healthy teeth nope
08:40 yours truly has been to the dentist I
08:43 think one time in 20 plus years almost
08:48 25 years I buy all the same equipment
08:51 that they have except for the polishers
08:53 and that kind of stuff but he's
08:55 electronic toothbrush use a hand
08:56 toothbrush I got the scrapers I tracked
08:58 my own plaque you know don't do it
09:01 unless you know what the hell you're
09:02 doing be careful I do have good teeth
09:06 but maybe you would have good teeth too
09:09 if we could get rid of all the
09:11 pollutants that go inside your mouth
09:14 osteoporosis and women
09:16 I mean God knows that rots it gathers up
09:19 in your pineal gland displacing your
09:21 pineal glands entire functionality which
09:23 is your connection to the universe okay
09:25 it's called the third eye in every other
09:27 country that studies such things because
09:32 they realize that there's a proxy
09:35 between you and the universe through
09:37 your third eye the Egyptians who built
09:39 the pyramids of which we still don't
09:41 understand how that works worship the
09:44 third eye gurus worship the third eye
09:47 these guys lived to be 100 40 years old
09:49 dudes who live off sunlight for 30 years
09:51 and now don't eat any food third eye
09:53 third eye right in the Western world you
09:57 were taught you know the opposite Dogma
09:59 theories about how your body works I
10:01 mean take a look at the Christian Church
10:03 they didn't allow anyone to look inside
10:05 the human body for thousands of years
10:08 you know at least I guess a 1.5 thousand
10:11 years right fifteen hundred years
10:13 because it was something they didn't
10:14 want you know it was God's domain you
10:16 don't get to play in God's domain
10:18 meanwhile the rest of the world that
10:20 believes in a third eye is looking
10:21 inside the human body constantly but
10:24 they teach you that the way that the
10:26 human body and soul and the universe
10:27 work is all hocus-pocus it they're all
10:31 so proportionately ignorant the more
10:34 they buy into that Dogma it's
10:35 interesting so what this episode is
10:38 going to focus on are these various
10:40 technologies and movements of climate
10:43 change being one aka formerly global
10:46 warming that's all based on [ __ ] if
10:49 you want a big breakdown of that I have
10:51 an episode called global warming go take
10:53 a look at it
10:54 breaks down all the science we're gonna
10:56 repeat a little bit of it here of course
10:57 but the real linchpin of this episode is
11:00 the fact that the ignorant are forcing
11:02 it on the informed and would say it's
11:05 just fascinating about I mean just think
11:07 about all these protest groups that are
11:09 out there in America right now not the
11:11 ones in Europe that I think are probably
11:13 doing the right thing and the ones that
11:15 Hong Kong that are doing the right thing
11:16 defending their freedom in America we
11:20 just have droves and droves of ignorant
11:23 human beings that you know comically are
11:28 sold
11:29 that they are part of a movement to stop
11:32 a particular thing from happening when
11:34 that's exactly what they are phenomenal
11:37 is it any surprise that you know 5g
11:40 let's talk about 5g first right
11:43 we had a gentleman report in I think on
11:47 the Facebook page he installs 5g and he
11:52 said look I've been to the 5g training
11:54 and it goes he said look after I install
11:56 one of these little 5g transmitters /
11:59 receivers on a light pole you know a
12:03 traffic light pole which is where
12:05 they're gonna hide a bunch of them
12:06 he says they took they tell us look you
12:09 have to be 10 15 feet away from the
12:11 thing before it's powered on because it
12:14 can kill you
12:15 oh that sounds safe that sounds so safe
12:19 any of you who study electrical
12:22 frequencies knows right away that if you
12:25 were to take a little tiny wave at a
12:28 very fixed frequency and beaming at
12:30 something and then take and you know so
12:32 it's losing its its amperage seems
12:35 harmless in a laboratory when you just
12:37 have one of them in the room and the
12:39 average distance is at least a hundred
12:41 feet away like any the mouse is okay
12:43 they take another one and another one
12:45 and another one or another one and
12:46 pointed at the mouse all those
12:48 frequencies will compound until that
12:49 mouse is being torn to shreds death by a
12:52 thousand needles as they used to say the
12:56 5g hasn't been approved by the world has
13:01 it been approved by the citizens of the
13:03 United States but a corporation is going
13:05 to put them all over the place all over
13:06 the United States of America supported
13:09 by our president right and it is going
13:14 to rot the human form it is not going to
13:18 increase your health I assure you but
13:22 they're going everywhere because
13:24 everyone needs fast internet we have to
13:26 beat the Chinese and the internet of
13:28 things boy if you wanted to beat the
13:30 Chinese give them the oppression we're
13:32 gonna put ours everywhere then get them
13:34 to put theirs in first and you'll see
13:36 them go from 1.5 billion straight down
13:39 whenever they whenever they decide to
13:43 recognize that their citizens are dying
13:45 which you know by air pollution we know
13:48 that that concern isn't terribly high in
13:50 in mainland China there a tour de force
13:54 there are communists ik country but do
13:57 what they want at the top and they say
13:59 well if we have to pay some prices down
14:00 below so be it unfortunately the the
14:05 grand experiment of freedom the United
14:07 States of America is just as ignorant
14:09 and about to do the same exact thing
14:14 little kids getting cancer should give
14:17 you an indicator of how screwed up the
14:19 world is something is systemically wrong
14:22 in the in the environment of the child
14:23 if they get cancer and I'm not
14:25 necessarily blaming the parents because
14:27 again what sort of degrees do you need
14:30 to develop the most basic cognitive
14:33 cautionary measures for your household
14:37 to ensure that your child isn't gonna be
14:40 sick you're supposed to be able to go to
14:41 the grocery store and trust what your
14:43 kids eat you're supposed to be able to
14:45 feed them tap water and it's supposed to
14:47 taste good and it's not supposed to have
14:48 a medicine in it but nobody does that
14:50 right but fluoride is in all the water
14:53 that's out there and what's interesting
14:55 is the 5g thing
14:57 aka cellphone technology right you sit
15:00 in your bedroom you're trying to
15:02 download a video or whatever and there's
15:03 that completion bar I mean I think we
15:05 honestly have it pretty licked with 4G
15:07 5g is a way for the deep state to invade
15:10 every single object in your house to
15:13 know when your battery's low and your
15:15 remote control to just know all kinds of
15:17 stuff about you you walked into the
15:19 living room you walked into the hallway
15:20 you walked into the bathroom you flush
15:22 the bathroom toilet so much water was
15:24 you know consumed you have these
15:27 ingredients in your house they'll know
15:30 absolutely everything about you if you
15:32 thought it was a little bit bizarre to
15:35 go to Amazon and they go to Facebook and
15:37 find Amazon ads for exactly what you
15:39 looked at on on Amazon and Facebook
15:43 excuse me you haven't seen anything yet
15:46 wait till it permeates every single atom
15:49 of your life they'll know what shirt you
15:53 have on
15:54 they'll be able to study the heat
15:56 signature of your crotch in your pants
15:58 ago they wear the jeans today I mean it
16:01 just goes infinitely and you're going to
16:03 put on a bunch of wearable technology
16:06 thus bringing the the electrical field
16:09 that disturbs your genetics that will
16:12 control how you can relax how your brain
16:16 functions your brain tighten needs to be
16:18 able to talk clearly with all of the
16:20 organs in your body if it wasn't bad
16:23 enough that we're putting ionized
16:25 processed food into our body called fast
16:28 food or processed food and then
16:31 fluoridating the water by putting a
16:33 bunch of other you know habitual things
16:35 addictions that we have into our body
16:37 alcohol whatever it is into our body
16:41 disrupting our body's normal
16:43 functionality weights you wear all this
16:46 technology all over your body you can't
16:49 make a creature out of electromagnetic
16:52 nervous system right and then put a
16:56 bunch of electricity on your body and
16:58 have that body work well it's just basic
17:01 math right a crude example would be you
17:07 have a garden hose like the one I always
17:08 film right because it's sitting here I
17:10 use it to water down my lawn what would
17:12 be as if I you know I don't know put
17:14 marbles in it but little bee bees in it
17:17 whatever and I kind of stick to the
17:20 walls of the hose i buy jabot with the
17:23 knife every once in a while I'm
17:24 disturbing the very integrity of this
17:27 device - supposedly gain some big
17:30 benefit of knowing how much water goes
17:32 through it or whatever making the water
17:35 blue just so it's entertaining when I
17:37 water my lawn without your body that's
17:41 your body on a bunch of electricity a
17:43 bunch of watches and other devices that
17:46 have severe electromagnetic fields cell
17:51 phones we're not supposed to put them
17:52 right against our skin says that in
17:54 every manual inside the phone but of
17:56 course even I haven't even looked that
17:58 up I don't know where the hell that is
17:59 inside the manual I'm sure it's like you
18:02 know off you skated and a bunch of
18:04 legalese but three quarters of an inch
18:06 away from your flesh is
18:08 the is the minimum amount of distance
18:12 you're supposed to put between a cell
18:13 phone but every single person puts up
18:15 right against their ear boiling the
18:17 mitochondria behind the ear which is why
18:19 a lot of people are getting little
18:20 cancers inside their face it's why
18:22 people have salivary cancer and die
18:26 women who are all healthy right there
18:29 maybe think a healthy late in life so
18:31 there's still kind of chubby but they
18:32 put the cell phone right inside their
18:34 little sports bras they jog for hours
18:36 and then right there they get a nice
18:38 little lump there's so much empirical
18:42 evidence of this my kid who wasn't quite
18:44 sure dad was telling the truth went did
18:46 a report on it in college
18:47 sent me all the photographs sent me a
18:49 report and it was more stunning than I
18:53 ever thought my buddy's wife died of
18:57 this stuff exactly where she put the
18:59 phone on her boob she got a lump they
19:02 screwed up the biopsy and then a year
19:05 later it had crawled all over her body
19:07 and a couple years later she died
19:10 married for 38 years they still should
19:13 be together right now
19:15 she should have outlived him because of
19:18 their age difference a couple years plus
19:20 she's a woman anyway but nope she's gone
19:24 he had to rebuild his life in his 60s
19:27 that's a rough gig man that's a rough
19:31 gig all taken out by technology but
19:33 we're not allowed to blame the
19:34 technology are we you're not allowed to
19:37 blame the vaccination which puts the
19:40 majority of the content that goes into
19:41 your body is aluminum and mercury
19:45 mercury shreds your brain aluminum
19:49 SuperDuper bad to have in your body
19:51 super duper Ben only way to get it out
19:55 efficiently is a literally a
19:59 detoxification dialysis of your blood or
20:03 you got a tube going out and the tube
20:05 going in and it goes out it goes through
20:06 a machine the machines ripping all this
20:08 stuff out and then it puts it back in
20:10 your body clean and then you can't you
20:12 still got it still in your head you
20:13 still have it in various nooks and
20:15 crannies in your mind and your body but
20:17 now think about the math of this whole
20:19 argument
20:20 a sector of the world goes [ __ ] crazy
20:23 absolutely crazy buys into all this [ __ ]
20:26 that they have no knowledge of and
20:29 simply because a profiteering scientist
20:31 or businessman person whatever tells
20:35 them that this is good
20:36 writes a bunch of feel good articles
20:38 blames a bunch of crap that has nothing
20:40 to do with anything right there was a
20:41 woman recently uh it was she's sixteen
20:44 years old she's in Puerto Rico she
20:47 spends an entire day outside in the
20:50 sweltering Sun her whole back bubbles up
20:52 really bad she got second-degree burns
20:54 but being outside too [ __ ] long what
20:58 do they do they spin it as some goddamn
21:00 climate change thing like the Sun in
21:01 Puerto Rico is like super hot now
21:03 because of global warming give me a
21:06 break the person neglected the basic
21:10 physics of being in the Sun you know me
21:14 I love the Sun I'm in the Sun all the
21:16 time I got a tan year-round because of
21:18 this show I believe we're made of ether
21:22 and I think the best way to get injected
21:23 is to get sunlight okay I'm not dying to
21:28 cancer I don't have any skin cancer I
21:31 come from a place where they calls
21:33 rednecks why do they call this rednecks
21:35 because we spend I don't know 10 to 14
21:38 hours in the Sun working on fields yeah
21:40 they were shirts and stuff flannel put
21:43 the Hat on but we got rednecks because
21:45 we've been burned and hey we don't have
21:48 huge oncology clinics in the Midwest
21:50 where every farmer comes in just
21:51 crawling with some you know Doon you
21:54 know poppy face and stuff no we're okay
21:58 we're okay
21:59 my died of heart attack is reading too
22:01 much butter or something else but that's
22:04 not related to the Sun people were
22:07 sunscreen all the time well there's tons
22:08 of studies that prove that sunscreen
22:10 turns into a pure carcinogen on the
22:12 surface of your body once it's exposed
22:14 to sunlight so you take it out of the
22:17 bottle in a laboratory and it's fine
22:19 expose it to sunlight which is what it's
22:21 supposed to be protecting you from that
22:24 turns into a toxin I think most of you
22:27 know your epidermis your skin has pores
22:30 in it right
22:31 rub that crap on your face you got that
22:34 stuff going in your eye sockets in your
22:36 ear and your nose in your mouth how many
22:39 times have you tasted accidentally your
22:42 sunblock you got a little you know cut
22:45 on your arm going right in your
22:46 bloodstream yeah that's great that's
22:49 great
22:50 because hey we evolved here right
22:53 because either evolution protected us
22:56 from the Sun or God gave us the natural
22:59 sunscreen somehow nope nope actually
23:02 either one of the sciences that you
23:04 believe whether we are created or
23:05 evolved we didn't have any of this stuff
23:08 in our system and we managed to create a
23:11 population problem with without that
23:13 technology the other big one which is a
23:16 funny meme online has to do with the the
23:19 whole idea of vaccinations there's a
23:23 couple groups in the world that don't
23:24 vaccinate one of the the Quakers and the
23:28 Amish they don't do it and one that I
23:31 just recently found out which is a big
23:33 contention in upstate New York is the
23:35 Hasidic Jews don't do it either
23:37 what are they dumb no they're fine
23:41 they're smart they're protecting their
23:43 children and the idea is that the meme
23:46 is you know if you don't vaccinate your
23:49 kids then my kids gonna get sick wait a
23:53 minute isn't the theory but if you
23:56 vaccinate your kid your kid can't catch
23:57 it so you think you're the super smart
24:00 parent not any one of you listening but
24:02 your neighbors I think that they're
24:04 super brilliant injecting all this
24:06 permanent destruction of their child's
24:09 brain of your child's aggression you
24:12 know the world requires right now more
24:14 than ever that your child be extremely
24:16 aggressive about finding jobs about
24:19 getting educated about looking for
24:20 opportunities about getting back up
24:23 after being knocked down because right
24:25 now in this world
24:26 everyone's getting punched in the pants
24:28 everyone constantly it's never gonna
24:30 stop
24:31 not for your lifetime exponential change
24:34 is going to go on for the next 50 to 75
24:36 years and a hundred years from now the
24:38 whole landscape of what we do for a
24:40 living is going to be completely
24:41 unrecognizable from what we have right
24:44 now so
24:44 we're creating a bunch of these kids
24:47 that lack the agressor gene why are
24:50 these kids turning into snowflakes or
24:52 why are they snowflakes they lack the
24:54 gene to fight back because of these
24:56 vaccinations and this horrible food that
24:58 keeps them malnutritioned all this
25:00 vegetarianism hey yeah you can kill
25:04 cancer like a mofo with vegetarianism
25:05 you know it has its purpose okay if you
25:09 live in a beautiful perfect world where
25:11 you don't need to be aggressive sure do
25:13 it but the studies in India alone prove
25:15 that the the sex the very few sex of
25:18 India that don't eat meat
25:19 which they teach in America everyone in
25:22 India doesn't eat meat that's absolutely
25:23 hilarious but the few sects that don't
25:25 eat meat are SuperDuper peaceful they
25:28 live in forests and jungles and they
25:30 just they go to church every day and
25:32 they're totally cool a lot of the monks
25:34 live up in those the wild Tibetan
25:37 temples super-earths NH well you have
25:40 you live in that world and knock
25:41 yourself out go do it because you can
25:44 watch out for your pancreas watch out
25:47 for all your complex organs in your body
25:49 because eventually when your body's
25:51 going to be trying to look for the
25:52 protein the recombination protein that
25:54 the cow created from a grass right goes
25:58 into your body and it you won't have any
26:02 if you don't eat it you won't have any
26:04 and then it's going to cannibalize your
26:05 own internal organs to procreate to do
26:07 mitosis so many people have gone into
26:11 that movement have pulled out now and
26:13 said man I was never more sick and
26:15 depressed and lacked energy than when I
26:17 was a vegetarian again I'm not saying
26:21 you have to eat that much meat I've told
26:23 you guys several times on this show I
26:24 talked to one of the most healthy
26:25 looking 70 year old men who was a PhD
26:29 physician nutritionists in this field
26:33 and I said look how much meat do you
26:35 need to eat and he says well about a
26:37 deck of cards I mean you get a piece of
26:39 meat that's the size of a deck of cards
26:41 all 52 cards right little bicycle box
26:45 eat that once a week make sure it's
26:48 corn-fed not toxified and you'll be okay
26:53 well think about that that means six
26:55 days of the week you can be a vegetarian
26:57 one day a week you consume a deck of
27:00 cards of beef and you'll have the
27:01 proteins that you need to rebuild your
27:03 body remember you're made of proteins
27:06 okay and this [ __ ] that hold the
27:08 purest protein the worlds in a in a in a
27:12 plant
27:13 okay the plant gets consumed by the cow
27:17 the cow changes the proteins into his
27:20 proteins right if a cow had the same
27:22 proteins as a plant guess what the cow
27:24 would be he'd be a [ __ ] plan proteins
27:28 are half of your chromosomes DNA's the
27:30 other half of your chromosomes DNA are
27:32 the building blocks proteins are the
27:35 schematics of what to build so when
27:38 someone tells you you're almost like a
27:39 earthworm that's because the Legos that
27:43 build a Millenium Falcon are the same
27:44 Legos that build a Star Destroyer it's
27:46 the same pieces Lego the company in
27:50 Copenhagen does not create special Legos
27:54 so you can build these other things they
27:56 know that fundamental shapes will get
27:57 you anywhere you need to go so the
27:59 nucleic acid chain ACTG
28:02 is in everything that has DNA but your
28:06 protein patterns are still a gigantic
28:08 mystery to the normal medical world so
28:13 play out this scenario with me for a
28:14 split second you're with your spouse
28:16 you're the woman you're the man doesn't
28:19 matter if you're a woman this should
28:20 even be more intense but if you're a man
28:22 you're also the protector either you
28:27 plan it or it simply happens you get
28:30 pregnant as a couple right the wife gets
28:34 pregnant despite what the globalists
28:37 will tell you about men getting pregnant
28:38 it's not gonna happen in your lifetime
28:40 but a woman gets pregnant now you carry
28:43 this child but you want this child you
28:46 carry this child and you go holistic man
28:49 you eat only organic food you stay away
28:52 from wireless technology maybe you even
28:54 move up into the hills so you get away
28:56 from everything you could possibly
28:57 disturb your child's growth in the womb
29:00 because you know that as the baby is
29:01 teeny teeny tiny anything that messes
29:05 with the formation of a child can
29:07 systemic ly blow up into a bunch of
29:08 horrible things okay
29:11 you're successful you're successful you
29:14 have a bouncing baby that's amazing
29:18 whatever weight it should be it's what
29:19 it is birth is perfect you squat in a
29:24 pool of water and the two of you have
29:26 this beautiful experience with your
29:28 birth mother or doctor or whatever who's
29:30 with you and the baby floats up to the
29:32 daddy and it's just in a warm thing of
29:35 water it's no crying it's no crying you
29:37 separate you know you pinch off the bill
29:39 cooke or cut it out to clean up the mom
29:41 everything is great is there pain sure
29:45 there is pain but come on you have a
29:47 child now it's pretty NOSSA thing and
29:50 now all of a sudden you try to take your
29:55 child to a pediatrician try to get into
29:57 some preschool or kindergarten K through
30:00 five and they ask you have you
30:04 vaccinated your child's and let's just
30:08 say you weren't aware of this was going
30:11 to occur and then all of a sudden what
30:15 they want to do to your child is stick a
30:17 bunch of needles in your child and put a
30:20 bunch of private for-profit vaccinations
30:23 into your kid I mean they want to put
30:27 the second your child's board they they
30:28 try to jab these needles into the thighs
30:31 of your kid both of them into the bone
30:33 marrow and give them vaccinations the
30:35 minute they're born I was totally asleep
30:39 when my daughter was born but I tell you
30:40 man I wanted to [ __ ] kill this woman
30:43 the second she touched my kid with the
30:45 needle I mean I wanted to commit murder
30:47 it was like what are you doing to my kid
30:51 and I it was almost as if God came down
30:55 and said well you blew that one and my
30:59 kid turned out okay she managed to fight
31:01 off all that stuff but again she's still
31:03 young who knows where all that stuff
31:05 goes in the end right and it's way worse
31:09 today my kid did not have the gigantic
31:12 regiment that you're supposed to do
31:14 today we didn't have schools that
31:16 mandated it at all her whole life time
31:19 she didn't have to have any of that
31:20 stuff but today it's different game
31:24 but now why do they want to give your
31:27 kid all this stuff but it's a
31:30 multi-tiered problem why your kids
31:33 getting vaccinated the first tier is
31:36 that a corporation wants to make money
31:38 and they've been making initially cures
31:41 or you know over a hundred years ago for
31:44 things like polio which gave a bunch of
31:45 people polio and killed them then they
31:49 thought well why will we cure patients
31:51 because that gets rid of our customers
31:52 so let's go into treatments and that
31:54 took a little while to find things to
31:56 treat and we'll just overlook the fact
32:00 that maybe they participated in the
32:01 spread of the problem in the first place
32:03 right it's it's better for them to
32:04 spread things that they can treat but
32:07 that's a little devious and dark for the
32:08 mind a wrap you know to wrap around and
32:11 then they found preventive care
32:14 somewhere in the 80s someone hatched
32:16 that thing took about a decade more to
32:18 really get it going but vaccines
32:21 preventive care mandated to every single
32:26 person was their dream that they never
32:28 go out of business but how you gonna get
32:30 such a chaotic crazy toxic thing
32:33 mandated how do you do that hmm well
32:41 they looked at the legalese and realized
32:43 that there probably weren't going to get
32:44 such a thing created on a federal level
32:46 so he went down to the state level they
32:49 tried to find the most corrupt
32:51 politicians they could possibly find to
32:53 just simply pay them off but there
32:55 weren't a lot of takers so stage two was
32:58 to get a bunch of ex pharmaceutical
33:01 lobbyists a pharmaceutical specialist
33:03 and loyalists to pharmaceuticals in
33:05 general and people that will take a
33:06 paycheck for anything and dress them up
33:10 get their hair cut get him you know
33:12 teach him how to become a politician and
33:15 stick him right into office and they
33:18 became governor's senators house
33:23 representatives everyone's taking a
33:26 paycheck so now you have this legal
33:31 thing that's possible it's not there yet
33:34 because they realized that the second
33:36 half of the equation was too
33:38 it's the public that this was gonna be a
33:40 good thing because how do laws get
33:42 passed they get voted on okay well
33:45 that's gonna be a little tough how do
33:48 you tell someone well you could catch
33:50 check-in chicken pox and be fine maybe
33:52 you have a couple little blemishes the
33:54 last four ten years or so but by the
33:55 time you're 25 all that stuff's usually
33:58 melted away into your skin and then you
34:00 have a great antibody that you created
34:02 yourself because you've got a full-blown
34:04 case of chickenpox but somebody made a
34:07 chicken pox vaccination
34:09 weaker incompatible with what you'll end
34:12 up bumping into in your adult life which
34:14 will turn into shingles which is
34:15 extremely painful and typically keeps
34:19 coming back and keeps coming back right
34:21 well we know that news is not real I can
34:26 tell you and I've told you guys before
34:28 articles on the front pages of
34:30 newspapers websites are all purchased by
34:33 private companies we see all these you
34:35 know Instagram influencers buying
34:38 articles in their front hot mom and earn
34:40 bikini 55 years old post you know
34:43 photographs on her end so it links
34:45 straight to her Instagram somebody
34:47 bought that article to drive her
34:50 business so that she could get you know
34:52 sponsorship to have a business okay
34:56 that's not the end of the world right
34:58 and you know whatever I'd probably
34:59 rather have that than a bunch of death
35:01 death death death death but they tend to
35:03 check her right death something nice
35:06 death something nice but what they did
35:09 to do is put trauma in there I have a
35:11 whole episode on trauma news this is
35:13 where they shock your brain with a
35:15 horrible article such that when you read
35:17 about something good happening
35:19 vaccinating children you feel good and
35:21 you have lonely attached to that is a
35:23 bright spot in your day oh they're
35:26 fascinating children that's great so
35:28 they build up this hysteria in all 50
35:31 states timed perfectly they're buying
35:34 gigantic PR ad runs they're buying fake
35:38 articles about fake situations maybe one
35:42 kid dies of something very very unique
35:44 they pump that up and tell you there's
35:46 an epidemic measles epidemics mumps you
35:50 know
35:51 whooping cough all these things that
35:52 have been completely eradicated from the
35:54 Western world being perpetrated and
35:56 pushed up as if everybody's got it if
36:00 you push a pediatrician hard enough and
36:01 you say look you can get my kid that
36:04 vaccinations for measles the second that
36:06 you can produce the death certificate of
36:09 these kids personally and the second
36:12 that you prove to me that you vaccinate
36:14 your own children with this stuff and
36:15 the pediatricians will pull back and
36:18 yeah yeah yeah right you know I don't
36:19 really know that that's true I just hear
36:21 that today and we sell the [ __ ] out of
36:23 these vaccinations because it makes
36:24 profit for the clinic all right don't
36:28 forget how profit works people you buy
36:30 something for five bucks and you sell it
36:31 for fifteen and you get to take the ten
36:34 dollars that's profit minus your
36:36 expenses and believe me it's profitable
36:38 why do you think all the drug stores
36:40 around the world
36:40 put these you know yard signs out in the
36:42 front you know flu shot we got the flu
36:44 shot
36:45 we got the measles shot we got
36:46 everything shot shot shot-shot-shot
36:49 was a 60% of the weight of a shot is
36:51 aluminum the other part is mainly
36:54 mercury mercury is something called
36:56 thimerosal it's supposed to be a
36:57 preservative so you can keep a shot on
36:59 the Shelf forever I don't want to shot
37:02 this bone on the Shelf forever first of
37:03 all but second of all if it's going to
37:06 damage the brain of me or anyone I
37:09 shouldn't have an enemy ever but what do
37:12 they do the CDC said well we've pulled
37:14 thimerosal out of kids vaccinations
37:17 okay flu shot is immune to that it's not
37:20 a vaccination it's a flu shot so you
37:22 give your kid a flu shot boom you're
37:24 gonna probably catch the flu until
37:26 you're gonna write your brain for the
37:27 rest of your life and you have a fully
37:29 healthy body but your brain is gonna be
37:31 bonkers you'll just be sitting there
37:34 drooling if you think I'm exaggerating
37:37 you're listening to a guy that used to
37:40 take care of old ladies at hospice
37:43 joints and I've seen it the younger ones
37:46 are the most sick the older ones are
37:48 still walking around dressing themselves
37:50 and having full-blown conversations they
37:52 don't have dementia they don't have
37:54 Alzheimer's but the lower down you go
37:56 and they're there most likely all dead
37:59 the older ones at this point otherwise
38:01 they'd be a hundred and thirty years old
38:04 they are forcing the ignorant masses are
38:07 forcing an inhumane existence on the
38:11 rest of us and it's every single aspect
38:14 I think of our measurable lifes right
38:17 and if we keep going down this
38:20 totalitarian tiptoe you think that you
38:24 have a domain in your life that is all
38:25 yours well in my house they can't tell
38:27 me what to do oh really really it'll get
38:31 there you can't stop electromagnetic
38:35 waves going into your house you can't
38:36 stop it
38:37 5g will penetrate your home you can't
38:40 stop it these trails in the sky it
38:44 happened to correlate with all my
38:45 friends getting sick right I take C and
38:47 B 17 I eat well I keep hydrated I'm
38:51 walking into rooms or everyone's
38:53 coughing up a lung and they all get sick
38:55 at the same exact time even to two
38:57 groups of people that don't know each
38:58 other and don't touch each other we get
39:00 sick at the same time like I used to
39:02 tell you 2008 to 2011 I was obsessed
39:07 with taking photographs of chemtrails
39:09 and what I would notice is that when
39:12 they were starting to spray in October
39:14 and November
39:16 like horrendously bad in Orange County I
39:18 mean ridiculously obvious that these
39:21 things are not commercial flights I go
39:24 into my office with my employees and
39:26 they knew I was into some of this stuff
39:28 some of my employees were secretly into
39:29 this stuff I'd say start taking your see
39:32 everybody because you're about to get
39:33 really really sick and they'd laugh and
39:35 then they'd all get really really sick I
39:37 mean bad taking time off from work I'm
39:40 losing money out of my company and
39:41 they're not having any fun with their
39:43 life because of the stuff the
39:45 particulates that threaten their immune
39:47 system and then again you're not
39:49 catching necessarily flew out of the sky
39:50 you're just catching whatever is going
39:53 around because your immune system has
39:54 been compromised go see my episodes on
39:57 chemtrails now take there's no there's
40:01 only like two but I mentioned them often
40:03 right GMO foods we can't get a company
40:09 or I should say this let me rephrase
40:11 that we can't get a state or federal
40:13 order slash law
40:16 to mandate the labeling of the toxic
40:19 toxic food supply known as genetically
40:22 modified organisms something again that
40:25 was never clinically tested properly if
40:27 you couldn't replace all the goddamn
40:29 food in the world with this horrible
40:31 [ __ ] then I want a clinical study that's
40:34 like 50 years I want to know birth rates
40:39 I want to know death rates I want to
40:43 know everything that studied in the
40:44 clinical study know this stuff was put
40:48 in our food supply as a big oh you
40:50 remember the Zinfandel grape you know
40:52 the skins a little bit stronger so it
40:54 survives weather better completely GMO
40:57 great without what's great right alcohol
41:01 it tastes good you're not dying are you
41:03 it's like well hmm you don't know you
41:06 don't know if this stuff kills you in 20
41:08 years and you're 40 years old are you
41:11 good with checking out at 60 and you're
41:14 just an absolute vegetable at 60 right
41:17 you can't remember anything your eyes
41:18 don't work you repeat yourself all the
41:20 time to your to your family is that that
41:24 we want to go out it's not the way I
41:26 want to go out but what happened at the
41:29 same time GMOs snuck into our food
41:31 supply have said this a couple of times
41:33 when I say it again birth rates went
41:35 down considerably people women not being
41:38 able to have children went through the
41:41 roof and these clinics where they do all
41:44 this in vitro where did we get Octomom
41:47 that chick I guarantee you suckin down
41:50 tons of GMO every day of her life even
41:52 to this day but I guarantee she did it
41:54 before she had birth problems now other
41:56 genetic congenital birth problems sure
41:58 but the statistics prove this went
42:01 through the roof in the 90s and it's
42:02 still a big problem today
42:03 it created a spermicide in the females
42:07 their abuse ystem thought that the male
42:10 sperm was an invader what else happened
42:14 when GMOs came online that were really
42:16 finding out in the 21st century
42:18 everyone's guts are being rotted by this
42:20 stuff so probiotics came to the rescue
42:25 now we have a whole other industry to
42:27 counteract the effects of GMOs
42:31 and for those of you they're still
42:34 struggling with the concept that a
42:36 corporation would not have your best
42:38 interests at hands your your cancer
42:40 oncology Center has your best interest
42:43 in hand you you think that these places
42:44 have people in them that care okay and
42:48 you might even work for these
42:50 organizations or have work when these
42:51 organizations like I care okay what the
42:53 tippy-top people don't care right and a
42:56 lot of cases the people that are owned
42:59 and run these pharmaceutical companies
43:00 any one of these companies make cell
43:02 phones they're chairing they're telling
43:03 the shareholders because they're
43:05 obligated to and this product might
43:07 actually kill people but what's the
43:09 formula the formula is the same at the
43:11 CDC the FDA if it only kills you 28
43:15 years later
43:15 well everyone listening to this
43:17 conversation will be retired in 20 years
43:19 they don't care I'll be gone some other
43:23 generation is gonna have to deal with it
43:24 and guess what I will have I will have
43:26 to help my family by taking a bunch of
43:28 blood money to create a summer home
43:31 experience to send someone to college
43:34 it's basically a big fu to you well they
43:38 put money in their own pockets how many
43:41 of you heard that cigarettes were good
43:43 in the 20th century right and again I
43:48 smoked cigars
43:49 they're pure tobacco no chemicals added
43:52 don't smoke acid cigars we don't inhale
43:54 George Burns smoked 15 to 20 cigars a
43:56 day lived to be a hundred Castro did the
43:59 same thing led to be 99 or a hundred or
44:01 whatever the hell it's a different
44:03 product okay but cigarette is made up
44:06 paper goopy chemicals between 750 and
44:09 1,500 chemicals in a cigarette the
44:12 filter alone is made of a bunch of
44:14 insulation which shreds your lung sacs
44:17 creating massive absorption of all of
44:20 these horrible chemicals you're not
44:21 smoking what you think you're smoking
44:23 plus you inhale it you try to inhale a
44:26 smidgen of this cigar I you'll be
44:29 coughing your head off I watched a guy
44:30 that a big tough guy came into this one
44:33 clowns and he's like I [ __ ] like like
44:36 okay here's a Cuban cigar one of the
44:37 mildest things you could possibly smoke
44:39 one second coughing up his lungs and in
44:42 these women you
44:43 two women were smoking with them two and
44:45 there look at him going you idiot stop
44:47 inhaling you know you're not these guys
44:50 here smoke all day long and they can't
44:51 inhale so don't don't try to do it tough
44:53 guy
44:53 it's really funny he's a sweet guy but
44:57 they used to tell people on television
45:00 the doctors used to tell people that
45:02 smoking cigarettes was good for you
45:05 doctors used to tell mothers you don't
45:07 want to have a big baby come out of your
45:08 vagina will smoke a bunch of cigarettes
45:10 and you'll get that eight pound kid
45:12 healthy eight pound bouncing baby girl
45:14 or boy down to like six pounds maybe
45:17 it'll be lucky and get a preemie and
45:19 you'll cut the whole nine-months cycle
45:20 short brilliant brilliant believing that
45:25 they have changed from back then to
45:28 today right they've got more technology
45:31 and mental technology and real
45:34 technology to hurt you and get away with
45:37 it than they have ever had in the
45:39 history of the world but we have these
45:42 groups the things that think that things
45:44 have changed but Democrats believe that
45:47 they changed in the 70s from being one
45:49 of the most patently racist political
45:52 groups in history to being the opposite
45:55 and you go when do you think you changed
45:58 what day did you celebrate this big
46:00 change because it never happened
46:02 we have utterly crazy running around the
46:06 world pushing in on all of us the next
46:09 gigantic one which is so subtle so
46:12 subtle the it's almost as if the this
46:16 movement which I'm going to mention
46:17 which is climate change
46:18 formerly global warming until they
46:21 realized the world was cooling because
46:23 there's no sunspots going on right now
46:25 that's the cycle okay instead of pushing
46:29 it in everyone's face they realized it's
46:31 a slow boil and how its boiled into all
46:34 kinds of movies television shows I just
46:37 watched
46:38 regrettably I was in a room that forced
46:41 me to watch the Pikachu movie there's a
46:45 little scene in the movie where this
46:47 action-packed things happen it's a
46:49 horrible movie by the way I mean talk
46:50 about bullring
46:52 for instance I liked the Angry Bird
46:55 movie believe it or not I thought that
46:57 was actually very well written not my
47:00 kind of movie I thought was excellent
47:01 Pikachu horrible but there's a little
47:03 action-packed scene where something's
47:07 happening the grounds falling away and
47:08 Pikachu's running with the kid and
47:10 there's a little line in there that goes
47:12 rank right Gosling right he plays the
47:15 Pikachu he's like oh my god how could
47:17 you not believe in climate change just
47:20 just insert it in the film Pacific Rim
47:24 about 2/3 the way through blame global
47:28 warming climate change how much is this
47:33 stuff just inserted into the narrative
47:34 but what's that whole movement about
47:37 it's about carbon taxation
47:39 what's carbon taxation sounds weird
47:42 sounds like hmm well taxes are theft
47:46 okay so taxes is someone stealing your
47:49 money for things that they're going to
47:52 put it to of which you have no vote how
47:56 could you possibly say I'm gonna elect
47:58 an official that's one vote for you one
48:01 vote from you for an official and then
48:04 they're gonna vote on tens of thousands
48:05 of things for who knows they have no
48:08 term limits in the House and the Senate
48:10 so did you really have the ability to
48:13 say not this that not this not that no
48:16 you don't I mean we have props props are
48:19 always taxes never vote for a prop
48:20 because it's always taxation right
48:23 carbon taxation is designed to do one
48:26 thing and that's depopulate the world
48:28 that's what it's about
48:30 because when it gets all turned on and
48:32 this is something we need to be actively
48:34 fighting in conversation actively
48:36 fighting politically it's gonna cost too
48:40 much to have a second child unless
48:43 you're rich hmm who really really
48:47 propagates this stuff the rich they
48:52 propagate all this stuff because they're
48:53 never going to have any problems paying
48:55 for their kids in fact they may just get
48:58 allocations because they're politicians
49:00 but you don't get and everything you do
49:04 talk about that to italian terry and
49:06 tiptoe i talked about early in this
49:08 episode do you think you have
49:09 that's free let me ask you this if
49:12 you're in the knighted States of America
49:13 do you own your house I mean do you
49:14 really own it can you just pay for it
49:16 one time and then you don't have to pay
49:19 anymore no taxation on your house
49:21 property or anything no you lease the
49:24 land from the state royal state real
49:28 estate it's all a big ancient law system
49:32 to make sure that the people never own
49:34 anything because these other people are
49:36 bigger and better than you and if they
49:40 want your land and you've paid up all
49:41 your bills they have something called
49:44 eminent domain to steal it from you and
49:46 give you rock-bottom prices now let's
49:50 just let's just go through the basic
49:52 science of climate change okay a bunch
49:54 of co2 in the air they can't figure it
49:56 out well first and foremost you need to
49:59 remember all organic life like plants
50:02 like the stuff I'm surrounded with use
50:03 co2 to exist and what did they make they
50:07 make a little tiny substance that humans
50:10 use called oxygen so it's a fairly
50:12 important ecosystem that we have here
50:14 but the assertion is is that man has
50:16 created a bunch more co2 okay the amount
50:21 of co2 in the greenhouse gas layer index
50:23 which is every chemical up there in the
50:25 sky that creates warmth on earth because
50:28 you could take hairspray and do that and
50:31 it's not in the index right it's only
50:32 the stuff that can trap heat 99.9% of
50:36 all that stuff is water the only part
50:39 that co2 is point zero five four percent
50:42 as 540 eighth of a single percent is co2
50:47 and that's all the oceans giving off
50:50 tons of you know co2 from rotting fish
50:53 that's volcanoes cow farts my farts
50:57 that's before you introduced industry
51:00 cars or any of that stuff of that teeny
51:04 tiny percent right take a penny out of a
51:07 dollar cut it into five hundred and
51:08 forty equal slices if you could even see
51:11 that with a naked eye that's all the co2
51:13 in the dollar that is the ecosystem of
51:15 the greenhouse gas layer index we
51:19 contribute maybe 1.5 to 2.5 percent
51:23 of that tiny invisible sliver if one
51:28 volcano pops a year and there's more
51:30 than one that pops every single year the
51:32 amount of co2 put out by a single
51:34 volcano eclipses man's entire
51:36 contribution for the year several times
51:39 over it's an absurd assertion the
51:43 science does not prove it out it is
51:45 completely ridiculous when they hatch
51:47 this whole thing we were coming off of
51:49 the 2003 hot spring because the sunspots
51:52 on them on the Sun these areas that
51:56 create huge coronal mass ejections and a
51:59 lot of warmth towards us were in plenty
52:02 and then they all start shutting up
52:04 because it's in a cycle and now we're
52:06 going into a cold phase this last summer
52:10 summer last year was extremely short and
52:12 extremely cool I am now at the tail end
52:15 of July and right now it's already 71
52:19 degrees and it's 6:45 at night 2003 when
52:24 I first moved here it was probably about
52:27 75 to 85 degrees at this point and every
52:30 single day that I lived here for about 4
52:34 weeks in July in 2003 it was over a
52:36 hundred degrees I don't remember last
52:40 day we had an actual 100 degree day and
52:42 Huntington Beach it happens in Los
52:44 Angeles and the deeper desert areas but
52:46 right here it was warm as hell in 2003
52:48 because of sunspots I know it's a huge
52:52 stretch for those climatologist
52:54 to actually acknowledge that the Sun is
52:55 the main culprit for our heat but indeed
52:58 that is the case people so I always tell
53:01 you look education education education
53:04 is the solution to all of these
53:06 misconceptions but the problem is is
53:09 that we still we still don't have the
53:13 foundational sciences in the average
53:16 human being at least in the United
53:17 States I can't speak for any other
53:18 country ok at least the United States
53:21 reading and writing and arithmetic is
53:24 barely ever achieved by a single citizen
53:27 in this country anymore and that's not
53:30 exaggeration whatsoever the amount of
53:33 people that can't spell they can't speak
53:35 correctly
53:36 can't write an email without a bunch of
53:39 transposed words and misspellings is
53:40 off-the-chain people that can barely do
53:43 their multiplication tables
53:45 it's almost unanimous nowadays with
53:47 early graduates or I should say I should
53:50 rephrase that young graduates the kids
53:55 coming out of school today you know
53:58 every child no child left behind it
54:01 really is every child left behind
54:03 because they keep pushing them through
54:04 their graduation phases so they they so
54:07 it's a big success story these kids are
54:09 failing miserably and so they just keep
54:11 lowering the bar to get to the next
54:13 class these kids are graduating with
54:17 resumes that look like they were written
54:19 in crayon verbally the arts have been
54:23 defunded horrible and you know again the
54:27 left and the right at least up until the
54:30 last election in this country were the
54:33 same party they were the same party now
54:37 we have what looks like for the very
54:38 first time sort of a centralist
54:42 president that is you know he runs under
54:45 the right ticket but you know what are
54:46 you gonna do you have to run under the
54:47 opposite ticket of the the other guy
54:49 because you won't get any funding if you
54:51 run as an independent or a Green Party
54:52 person you can't win in those other
54:55 parties because it's all rigged so maybe
54:58 we have a little bit of a reprieve but
55:01 let's go back and finish up the analogy
55:03 of your kid getting vaccinated think
55:07 about it you're trying to protect your
55:09 child that's your job as a parent the
55:12 pharmaceutical companies have bought all
55:13 the PR to make you believe that it's
55:16 introducing a synthetic into your child
55:19 is your way of giving your child the
55:22 best possible chance of a future Wow
55:27 what do you not trust God do you not
55:29 trust evolution it doesn't matter what
55:31 school of thought you come from but if
55:32 you're religious oh my god
55:34 you need to tap your religious
55:37 Providence to ensure that you don't
55:41 vaccinate your kid just simply say my
55:43 church doesn't allow go become a Quaker
55:45 go become a Hasidic Jew convert whatever
55:47 you got to do so that when that form
55:49 in front of you and they say your child
55:51 can't go to school you say oh yeah they
55:53 can I'm just a Quaker you know I'm a
55:57 mama SH person whatever processed food
56:01 let's let's hit this and again I've hit
56:03 this several times but I want to attach
56:05 all of this to the causality model of
56:09 why this exists so that you can counter
56:11 the causality with your own judgment and
56:14 your own intelligence because it doesn't
56:17 take a hell of a lot of intelligence to
56:18 figure this out many of you know the
56:22 basics of wild animals they do not eat
56:27 dead animals what do they tell you when
56:30 you I think I think it's uh I think it's
56:33 it's one of the Bears that responds I
56:35 think it's the grizzly bear that will
56:37 respond to this but if you pretend to be
56:38 dead a lot of times animals will move on
56:42 because they they know that if they eat
56:45 dead animals it's bad for them it's a
56:47 genetic code over however many years
56:49 that they have evolved the mechanical
56:53 reason for that is that dead things are
56:55 ionized they're dead they're not living
56:57 anymore they're not moving anymore and
56:59 when you put stationary objects in your
57:02 body the reason why you don't eat
57:03 cardboard is because it doesn't it
57:06 wasn't it's not alive it maybe was alive
57:08 in some pulp tree at some point but it's
57:11 not alive anymore see it don't eat it we
57:14 don't eat bark off a tree there's a
57:16 reason for that it doesn't taste good
57:18 and that taste indication is your
57:21 genetic programming to make sure that
57:23 you know what is healthy and what is not
57:24 healthy your body is constantly moving
57:28 transmitting electricity all over your
57:30 body to communicate with every cell in
57:32 your body constantly constantly now I
57:36 want you to go to your local convenience
57:37 store whatever country you're in and
57:39 maybe you have a country that doesn't do
57:41 this but in America if you go to the
57:43 7-eleven and you - if I go to any
57:47 drugstore and try to find edible food it
57:52 is if you know how bad processed food is
57:56 for you and then you look at what you
57:58 have in terms of options to eat out of
58:00 these places - say you're starving to
58:01 death and you just have a couple
58:03 Sonia that you begged off the street and
58:05 you're gonna try to go into one of these
58:06 places to get food and I think about it
58:08 everything that you see it's like Ace
58:12 Ventura walking into the room with all
58:14 the dann animals you know trophies
58:16 everywhere from what does Ace Ventura to
58:19 where he does this look where he just
58:20 goes into this screen because to him
58:23 that was blasphemy killing all these
58:25 animals well same thing you go into your
58:27 local convenience store a drug store
58:30 which again it's not a place you should
58:31 try to eat but it should be possible to
58:33 get something real every once in a while
58:35 they'll have little baskets of fruits
58:38 and vegetables but those are all GMO
58:40 aren't they because why they're gonna
58:42 sit there on that shelf for a really
58:43 really long time they got to be GMO
58:45 because no one buys healthy food at
58:48 those places they're going to get their
58:49 box of chocolates or whatever to eat
58:51 their you know process Doritos and
58:55 Fritos and all these things that have
58:57 probably been you know on the shelf for
59:00 a ridiculously long amount of time we
59:03 have a you know a Trader Joe's here in
59:06 town several of them right and generally
59:08 there's some amazing food you can get a
59:10 Trader Joe's so I'm not completely
59:11 knocking it but if you were to go in
59:14 there and say how much of this is GMO
59:16 one they can't answer the question but -
59:18 how much of its processed GMO it might
59:24 even be the Hun GMO bit processed so
59:26 it's sitting there on the shelf like a
59:27 box of crackers if it can sit on the
59:30 shelf for three months and be fresh when
59:32 you open it it's not for you men it's
59:35 not for you now there's exceptions to
59:37 some of this right where you have like
59:39 dehydrated berries or dehydrated food or
59:42 you know beef jerky that's been
59:44 dehydrated beef and treated or whatever
59:46 yeah it's what the Native Americans used
59:48 to do all the time they should show any
59:49 Indians knew all about them you know
59:52 work from the land and they knew how to
59:54 dry things out so they could have food
59:56 in the winter time that's what
59:58 greeneries were all about back in the
60:00 day right so if you're gonna live like
60:02 that you're good but how is it okay how
60:08 is it that all of these stores have all
60:10 of this unedible food one it was a slow
60:13 boil right
60:14 it went from all-natural stuff come
60:17 GMOs stuff you could even eat a whole
60:19 thing of chocolate little tiny Donuts 30
60:22 years ago and it might have
60:24 preservatives in them there was the
60:26 whole Twinkie scene in ghostbusters
60:28 we started putting this stuff in the
60:30 food to make it last longer on the shelf
60:32 and it was like you know when you ate a
60:35 Twinkie
60:36 okay 1983 or whenever that movie came
60:38 out 85 whatever you know when you ate a
60:41 Twinkie that you weren't necessarily
60:43 feeding your nutritional side of things
60:46 so you're like I'm gonna eat good the
60:48 rest of the day but I'm gonna eat this
60:49 Twinkie I'm gonna eat this guy scream
60:51 whatever it is right but down how do you
60:55 do that first part of the day how do you
60:57 get healthy food the first part of the
60:59 day well if you go into third-world
61:02 countries this is what's interesting
61:04 everyone's always poopoo in third-world
61:06 countries so they're poor they don't
61:08 have 65 inch televisions and 5g and
61:11 whatever broadband fiber optics in their
61:14 house well they they harvest their food
61:18 every single day from non-gmo sources
61:19 use their other backyards and they treed
61:22 trade things vegetables and fruits and
61:25 meats and all kinds of good stuff and
61:27 it's all fresh every single day they
61:29 have a ritual in third-world countries
61:30 that go down and buy what they can fix
61:33 and eat that day and then they go back
61:35 down the next day you had a fresh round
61:37 of food first part of their day is
61:40 pretty good now what's interesting about
61:43 those individuals is that if you were to
61:47 give them some of the crappy food that
61:48 we eat but that you but they can prepare
61:52 the fresh and it's amazing but if we
61:57 gave them any of our processed food any
62:00 of our desserts and all that kind of
62:03 stuff to a third-world person who eats
62:05 fresh food constantly there's gonna be
62:08 an interesting side effect that they're
62:09 going to have right in front of your
62:10 face they're gonna eat this stuff half
62:13 the time it'll be way too sweet they're
62:14 gonna spit it out and throw it down go
62:16 oh my god or it's gonna taste good
62:19 they're gonna have this euphoric
62:20 experience of eating all this
62:22 crystallized super processed sugar but
62:25 then later they're going to notice their
62:27 body having all these problems
62:30 within within probably four hours
62:32 they're gonna sense it sugar in general
62:36 I never mentioned sugar like I should
62:38 sugar pure concentrated super processed
62:42 sugar is an inflammatory sugar is an
62:45 inflammatory anyway so let's say that I
62:49 got that hose right there let's say
62:50 that's your artery your vein leading up
62:53 to a capillary down from a capillary
62:55 which metabolize this oxygen into your
62:57 blood supply turning it colors or
62:59 whatever okay and now I start putting
63:04 something I start doing something to the
63:07 hose that makes it so boil up the whole
63:09 wall of this hose starts to swell up
63:11 what ends up happening well you ever put
63:14 your thumb on the end of a hose when you
63:16 just have an open hose so you can spray
63:18 it further into your yard
63:20 you're creating a pressure point which
63:22 makes it spray farther well the first
63:25 thing that happens when you have
63:26 inflammatory things in your body is you
63:28 get high blood pressure because just
63:31 like the hose if you put your finger on
63:33 it it starts compressing things where
63:35 your heart's gonna pump at the same
63:37 exact boom every single time but now
63:40 it's pumping through tighter and tighter
63:42 arteries and veins in your body your
63:44 organs themselves can start swelling up
63:48 and eventually you can get organ failure
63:51 because that's not good for you my blood
63:55 pressure takes away eyesight if any of
63:58 you've ever and this happens in your 40s
64:00 I can I can actually end up doing this
64:02 to myself because I don't need a
64:04 tremendous amount of sugary stuff but if
64:07 I go out I'm on the beach and I and I
64:10 this it's really hard to orchestrate but
64:12 let's just say I eat something super
64:14 sugary and then I try to look at
64:15 something to read it especially my
64:18 computer my eyesight is freaked out for
64:24 about 30 minutes to an hour because it
64:26 is trying to function my rods and my
64:30 cones are trying to function is trying
64:31 to send all that data back to my visual
64:34 cortex think it's processed in the
64:36 imagery everything that swells changed
64:39 to the shape of your eyeballs changes
64:42 the fluidity of your body
64:44 it's not good for you so what do we do
64:46 to finish up this episode what do we do
64:49 five jeez come on people
64:52 5 G's coming now I can't kill you with
64:56 the needle most likely no matter how
64:58 much I damage your body and poke and
65:00 hurt you with the needle sitting there
65:02 poking you probably very difficult
65:04 I could probably poke it in your neck
65:06 and your carotid artery and you still
65:08 live but if we brought in 100 people to
65:11 hit you with needles and you're gonna
65:14 start bleeding to death moderation is
65:16 how we take in a bunch of things we're
65:18 not supposed to take in you know like I
65:19 will I will eat from Dairy Queen
65:21 everyone small cuz it was part of my
65:22 childhood and the ice creams like the
65:24 best ice cream in the world in America
65:26 but then I wait months and months and
65:29 months before I ever do that again but
65:31 if I went and did it every single day I
65:33 don't know maybe I'd be dead already
65:36 you know who knows I'd have medical
65:38 issues I guarantee you and I'd be really
65:40 fat on camera makes it trust me man but
65:44 we're not gonna get 5g in moderation are
65:46 we you know they're trying to moderate
65:51 vaccinations right well don't get them
65:53 all at the same time get them slowly you
65:56 know there's this weird thing where our
65:58 our president United States right now is
66:03 you know there's a rumor that his son
66:05 got too many vaccinations and he may be
66:08 mildly autistic I'm not sure that that's
66:11 true
66:11 it's just something they say so what
66:15 they're doing now is saying well get him
66:16 all slowly and he still says well yes
66:18 I'm vaccinations are good no
66:21 vaccinations are good just that's my
66:24 opinion we were built properly from the
66:28 very GetGo can you get sick and die yeah
66:33 you can you can't get sick and die which
66:37 is why all the other things I've
66:39 mentioned and I'm missing the majority
66:41 of all the toxins in this world it's in
66:45 the 190s episode called toxins on this
66:49 show
66:51 if you just purify your life again you
66:57 can't control the quality of your air it
66:59 still planes up there leaving big giant
67:01 trails in the sky you can't control the
67:04 purity of your water unless you
67:05 specifically buy water without fluoride
67:07 or put filters on your house and you
67:10 can't control the air waves because 5g
67:12 networks are gonna be absolutely
67:13 everywhere if you put wireless networks
67:16 in your house and I have one in my house
67:17 I put it completely on the other side of
67:19 my house if I sit in my bedroom with my
67:22 phone it loses the internet over and
67:24 over and over again because it's so far
67:25 away i'm i i'm i would normally complain
67:29 about a service that could reach cuz my
67:31 previous router had no problem but now
67:33 I'm kind of happy now I'm kind of like
67:35 yeah a little less electromagnetic shed
67:37 on my body cool you would have to be
67:40 fairly wealthy to protect yourself a
67:43 hundred percent and the the one thing
67:48 that no one wants to ever hear and
67:49 believe me I don't want to hear it as
67:51 well is you actually have to move
67:53 physically to totally get rid of it
67:56 unless you're willing to build a Faraday
67:58 bunker house like my friends and Laguna
68:00 yeah that would actually do it well but
68:02 then you're gonna get out in your car
68:03 and drive around in that world getting
68:05 plastered by all these 5g routers how do
68:11 you win the only thing we can do is to
68:16 pass around the information constantly
68:18 and I'll tell you for anything I'm
68:20 mentioning on this particular show there
68:24 are studies from groups all around the
68:29 world that are proven everything I'm
68:30 saying to levels that are so much more
68:33 alarming than what I've told you it's if
68:37 you've never done the research you need
68:38 to brace yourself right now with 5g you
68:41 got you so you have a bunch of doctors
68:44 going into town hall meetings saying we
68:46 don't want the center and our
68:47 neighborhoods 4G is already causing
68:49 diabetes leukemia attention span
68:53 problems and children etc etc and
68:56 there's a whole gigantic litany of
68:57 things and these people are reading
68:59 medical journal publications to the town
69:03 hall meeting people
69:04 but what are the town hall meeting
69:06 people doing like mark Adela we're gonna
69:08 lease our building here at Town Hall and
69:12 we're gonna lease all of our traffic
69:14 lights to these cellular phone companies
69:16 and we're gonna make an extra million to
69:18 two million dollars a year off all the
69:21 leasing fees which thing goes into what
69:23 oh my jetski my summer home all this
69:26 other stuff and let's not overlook the
69:33 fact that sadly at least in America a
69:36 bunch of our politicians are some of the
69:38 dumbest human beings that have ever
69:40 spawn on this planet it's just a sad
69:45 fact it's a sad fact if you want to get
69:49 into an official government agency you
69:52 have to swallow all the blue pills
69:54 constantly because if you were lucid you
69:57 would be a loose cannon in those
69:59 organizations you'd want to make change
70:01 you'd want to de floor date your water
70:03 immediately if you had half a brain
70:04 that's not gonna be allowed they're
70:08 gonna kick you out they're gonna harass
70:09 you whatever can't do that so they've
70:13 infected society with all of this dogma
70:16 and we're sitting around just pretending
70:19 like it doesn't exist I am actually
70:24 concerned about 5g and I'm concerned
70:28 that what's going to take place the
70:31 unstoppable phase of what's going to
70:33 take place is that these things are
70:35 gonna get installed everywhere across
70:37 the United States and children and
70:41 elderly people are gonna be the first to
70:43 suffer the problems of this diabetes
70:45 should probably skyrocket but of course
70:48 they'll run a bunch of propaganda into
70:50 the news to give you an alternate reason
70:52 why
70:53 diabetes is skyrocketing well diabetes
70:55 skyrockets because there's a lot of
70:56 sugar and stuff well that's a very
70:58 legitimate thing corn syrup right and a
71:00 bunch of other derivatives of glosses
71:04 right sucrose all that stuff
71:09 so they'll believe that while the 5g is
71:11 actually the one that's disrupting your
71:13 insulins ability to wrap around sugar to
71:16 process in your body
71:17 well Alzheimer's is a malfunction of
71:21 various things in the brain okay so your
71:24 brains trying to behave normally but
71:26 it's getting bombarded by 5g well now
71:31 your brains got problems so imagine you
71:34 and I eat healthy all the time but
71:36 because we're constantly irradiated by
71:38 this stuff we're no longer able to enjoy
71:41 our lives we've got to move away from
71:45 the place that we've fought to live in
71:47 which has all the opportunity that we
71:49 use to earn money to have to live out in
71:52 the boonies and hope you can get a job
71:53 working from home with a wired internet
71:57 connection right if you have to live in
71:59 an uncomfortable environment where it's
72:02 really cold in winter time and really
72:04 hot in the summertime all because the
72:07 only option you have to stay healthy is
72:09 to get away from all this technology and
72:10 crazy GMO foods except you down the line
72:15 right so you won't find me especially
72:19 the longtime listeners know this for a
72:20 fact I rarely weigh in on things that
72:23 are alarmist that makes you you know
72:26 worried about your life because I don't
72:28 think stress is something that we should
72:31 have there in my opinion there are ways
72:35 of dealing with all of this stuff in a
72:37 calm cool reaction or you know way which
72:39 is one getting educated although it can
72:43 make your blood pressure go up because
72:44 you get infuriated at the ignorance II
72:46 of the world you know the but the first
72:49 thing you can do is protect yourself
72:50 personally if you have a family you you
72:54 know your kids don't care they'll do
72:56 whatever mom and dad says but you got to
72:57 get your spouse on board so the two of
72:59 you can work strategically to protect
73:01 your kids if you're on the cusp of a
73:03 relationship that you think might turn
73:05 into a family relationship it's probably
73:08 an extremely good idea that you test
73:14 these waters ahead of time what do you
73:16 think about this what do you think about
73:17 that and it may be that your spouse goes
73:19 look I really don't know anything about
73:21 it but I don't mind if you take the lead
73:23 on that and I'll just follow your lead
73:25 boom but I would be it'd be very wise I
73:30 think to sit down and have that
73:31 really close eye to eye contact there
73:33 you go look I don't want to make you
73:36 concerned because I'm your protector
73:38 especially feared the dude and you can
73:40 say it's important to me that when I say
73:45 something because some of these things
73:46 I'm gonna say that are bad for us you're
73:48 gonna be right on board no problem but
73:50 when it comes to vaccinating our
73:51 children you need to trust me again do
73:55 you believe in God do you believe in you
73:57 evolution because you're an atheist
73:58 scientist either way we survive without
74:02 all this crazy technology for the 99.9%
74:06 of the time we've been on earth
74:08 regardless of what theory you subscribe
74:10 to introducing all the synthetic stuff
74:14 to make a bunch of corporations profit
74:16 just mention mention cigarettes back in
74:20 the day being propagated as SuperDuper
74:23 healthy no one tells you cigars are
74:25 healthy and no one ever has told you
74:26 cigars are healthy right but I did blow
74:29 past one thing I want to bumper this
74:31 thing with I apologize stress is a huge
74:33 deal
74:34 stress is a hard one to identify
74:38 sometimes because it creeps up on you
74:40 again we all have some form of PTSD
74:42 which is something that's bothering you
74:45 of which you don't really have a
74:47 conscious awareness of so when you feel
74:51 the muscles in your body tense you get
74:54 sore shoulders and you haven't been
74:55 lifting anything you know if you work
74:57 out then that's why you've got that
74:59 issue help a friend move that's what you
75:00 have that issue you have sex for the
75:02 first time in a year that's why you have
75:03 that issue okay but if you're feeling
75:06 your body gets SuperDuper tense and
75:08 something's on you something is
75:10 demanding more of you than you feel
75:13 healthy with it's important at times to
75:16 take inventory of what's going on in
75:17 your life for those of you with kids and
75:21 I don't know how to solve this
75:22 particular problem because again my kid
75:24 had this while I was asleep
75:26 it didn't have a quite as bad as I've
75:27 heard it rumored today but the child
75:29 with a tremendous amount of homework is
75:31 a is a child that's going to most likely
75:34 have a very broken life in several areas
75:37 of personality development bonding with
75:41 the parent etc etc
75:44 there are a lot of alternate schools out
75:46 there in every district and I have seen
75:49 them personally where you can pull your
75:50 kid out of public school and put them
75:53 into schools to get the same exact
75:54 funding where the kid doesn't have
75:57 either any homework or a very light
76:01 amount of homework a couple of my
76:04 friends have gone through homeschooling
76:05 now and sorry it's not it's not the
76:09 parents teaching and they go off to
76:10 special schools they get all their
76:12 homework they take it home and they work
76:13 for several weeks they bring it back in
76:15 and these are some of the smartest
76:17 people I know on planet earth now of
76:19 course those of you who know that social
76:21 interaction is important you have to
76:23 make up for that in a different way but
76:26 I want you to check yourself when it
76:27 comes to stress because you know you can
76:31 you can strategically engage in stress
76:33 and you'll survive fine where you're
76:36 like okay I'm gonna take on this project
76:37 it's going to be this long in time and I
76:41 know what I'm gonna get out I've got
76:43 goals I'm not even gonna let it go
76:45 beyond a certain point and that's one
76:48 way you can manage your stress levels
76:50 but be careful your body doesn't
76:53 understand what's going on half the time
76:55 your physical body so when you're
76:58 stressed your body thinks you're being
77:00 attacked and it will do weird things
77:02 trying to help you out while you're
77:05 being stressed out and attacked so
77:07 that's why you want to make sure you
77:08 really take inventory of anything that's
77:10 causing that sort of emotion in your
77:11 body so anyway I hope you feel me on
77:14 this one I wanted to connect all of
77:15 these things to the lunacy of ignorant
77:18 people forcing this crap on us or
77:21 allowing this stuff to happen to us
77:23 there probably isn't any immediate
77:25 solution other than just simply be aware
77:27 of it so that when things start going
77:28 wrong in your life you know how to take
77:30 evasive action quickly either to protect
77:32 yourself or your loved ones it's
77:35 important to the degree you're a
77:37 valuable asset to this world which I
77:39 think you are if you have them into deep
