00:00 [Music]
00:32 good evening ladies and gentlemen
00:35 welcome back to deep thoughts I'm
00:38 debating today I am debating doing a
00:43 show on addiction are doing a show on
00:46 people worshipping let's do a show on
00:50 addiction it's going to be a little
00:53 tough for me because I believe I have my
00:57 addictions for sure but my addictions
01:00 are I think it would be slightly
01:04 different than the ones that people are
01:06 most concerned about which are the ones
01:08 that are more outrageous and I'm you
01:11 know I have not put much thought into
01:13 this I did an episode a couple years ago
01:16 about alcoholism and I've had some great
01:21 feedback from that and was really
01:22 touched that people least a couple guys
01:25 had seen it and sort of pulled out of it
01:28 but addiction is like this little
01:31 monster that's everywhere in it for some
01:34 of you the cigar I'm addicted to you
01:38 this is the Herrera
01:40 estel√≠ that you see at the Drew Estate
01:42 cigar that you'll see in the intro for
01:44 season three it's responsible for a lot
01:48 of good episode so hopefully it doesn't
01:49 fail us today every single time I've
01:52 ever heard of a story of an individual
01:54 telling me when they became addicted to
01:56 something I listened carefully I perked
02:02 my ears up because I had always heard
02:05 stories about how addiction removes your
02:09 control what was it the heavyset girl in
02:12 Dixie Chicks who I think has lost all of
02:15 her weight she said that her father or
02:19 stepfather poured cream into her cereal
02:25 when she was a little girl and said you
02:27 know taste this and she ate it and it
02:31 was obviously super duper massively
02:33 sweet and she said from that point
02:36 forward I ate food because it
02:40 represented this bonding moment with my
02:42 stepdad and the obviously the sugar
02:44 triggers from the taste of the food you
02:48 know that's the story I've heard one
02:49 time but it was so impactful to me I
02:51 listened and I was like wow I don't
02:55 think I look at a bowl of cereal anymore
02:57 in my life without they get about that
02:58 story that's the curse of like my memory
03:00 now let's think about it very
03:04 analytically here I'm going to parse a
03:06 few hairs being addicted is something
03:10 that's good for you no one ever
03:12 complains about being addicted to
03:15 something that either is destructive to
03:17 you or bothers others well those are the
03:20 addictions that we are most concerned
03:22 about right nobody wants an annoying
03:26 person in their life and we don't want
03:29 to have friends and family losing
03:32 control although I apologize for last
03:35 couple episodes being windy it's the
03:37 Santa Ana winds here in SoCal what's
03:40 interesting is I don't hear any of the
03:43 noise that you hear when the wind hits
03:46 the mic and it takes a lot to make this
03:48 microphone have wind the back to
03:52 addiction here Tony Robbins is a great
03:59 resource for breaking addiction and I'm
04:03 going to give you the gist of what he
04:04 does but you need to listen to him to
04:08 get the actual SuperDuper techniques
04:11 because what he has our several
04:15 techniques for different individuals to
04:17 use and so it takes hours and hours and
04:20 hours to find the one that he's talking
04:21 about that matches you
04:24 but the main goal of his mechanism is to
04:30 say you got positive and negative
04:32 backwards in your mind that's where
04:35 addictions come from that you don't like
04:38 but addictions aren't just these little
04:41 childhood things that your parent gives
04:44 you and your little kid you know I have
04:47 a family member of mine that is the only
04:49 obese person in our family and the
04:52 reason why he is obese is that when he
04:55 was young his parents were older and
04:59 working and so in order to pacify him
05:02 they gave him money to go buy food you
05:08 know it's obviously turning to candy so
05:11 those are those those are moments that
05:13 are innocent little moments that turn
05:15 into lifelong dependencies and
05:18 addictions and then you have the more
05:22 there's at least two other stages to
05:25 this and again I am just pulling this
05:28 out of my butt so I mean forgive me for
05:30 not being more clinical about it I
05:32 thought if I if I put it on if I
05:35 researched it on the internet and got a
05:37 bunch of 12-step programs in my head
05:38 then I would be doing the show a
05:40 disservice and perhaps touching on
05:43 something that is not in those whatever
05:47 formal stages of addiction there's at
05:51 least two other areas where I think that
05:54 addiction happens one is fairly trivial
05:57 that to understand and one is a little
05:59 more complex to understand but you know
06:02 one of them is the chemical reaction
06:05 you're putting a food in your mouth
06:09 our drug and it's having a profound
06:12 effect on your neurology on your
06:16 dopamine your adrenaline and when you
06:20 start messing with the frequency of
06:22 those two chemical supplies and they've
06:27 got it all figured out by the way I mean
06:29 they got a completely figured out
06:30 there's biorhythms of these chemicals
06:33 being in being depleted in
06:37 it's really a depletion algorithm 100%
06:39 so they spiked it which creates a
06:42 depletion which creates pain now it's
06:47 safe to say that the human body has been
06:48 perfectly designed if it works perfectly
06:55 now if a father and mother are toxified
06:58 during conception if the mother toxified
07:02 the child during gestation the
07:06 nine-month gestation and again this is
07:08 not about bad moms and bad females
07:11 because how the hell can we it would be
07:14 so difficult to protect our women in
07:18 this world from toxins you could never
07:22 go out to eat you'd have to make every
07:24 meal fresh you have to make sure that
07:26 everything you get from the world is
07:28 from a reliable source it's a filter all
07:30 your water I mean it it would just be
07:33 it's very very tough and we don't know
07:34 what the latest chemical is it's out
07:36 there she couldn't wear any makeup
07:38 couldn't brush your teeth without the
07:40 stuff that's out there using hair
07:42 products the toxins are everywhere and
07:46 you know what's interesting is I think
07:48 it was the first Batman made 1989 that
07:51 the movie with Tim Burton directing that
07:54 had the it's the combination of
07:57 chemicals that really kill you and I
08:00 believe that there's a lot of you know
08:02 truth to that they just they just said
08:05 that chlorine in a pool mix with
08:07 sunscreen instantaneously creates a
08:11 carcinogen right on top of your skin
08:12 super bad for you
08:14 so let's separately just fine but if a
08:18 baby is taken care of from inception to
08:21 birth and there's no toxification there
08:23 in some jungle somewhere but I think
08:26 that the neural chemistry in that mind
08:28 is prepared to have a normal life at a
08:33 minimum but let's just think of a
08:36 perfect frequency right a little sine
08:38 cosine wave in front of your face and it
08:43 seems to be in perpetual balance it just
08:45 hums like a note
08:49 and then we eat sugar we drink a power
08:54 drink we do something it's not it's not
09:01 illegal yet right run even up to
09:03 marijuana or booze or anything like that
09:05 and then it starts to process you know
09:08 as the wave starts to undulate
09:10 starts to go through some strange
09:12 behaviors now the body has always been
09:14 designed one way which is when it's in a
09:17 perfect condition there's no pain and
09:19 when it changes there's pain and that's
09:25 how you know that something's wrong with
09:26 you the reason why mosquito bite each is
09:29 is that the mosquito bite makes your
09:32 skin swell and it's breaking down the
09:36 travel of blood through your epidermis
09:39 and it needs you to scratch it to rub it
09:43 such that you can stimulate the blood
09:45 flow from point A to point B over the
09:46 swollen area where your cells are
09:49 starting to try and repair the bite
09:51 right and that's just being alive
09:56 obviously a power drink is just as
09:58 intense as alcohol on one level harder
10:02 arteries that's why both you know Red
10:05 Bull gives you wings it's all a big
10:07 [ __ ] joke in your face it hardens
10:09 your arteries and you'll have a heart
10:11 attack but no one's going to say you had
10:12 the heart attack because of Red Bull it
10:15 was invented in European nightclubs
10:17 because they wanted a stimulant to mix
10:20 with it the depressant of alcohol so
10:22 that you would drink more at night it's
10:25 really made for mixing drinks this is
10:27 why when you drink it by itself it
10:28 tastes so [ __ ] horrible it's because
10:32 it's supposed to be mixed with something
10:33 else and diluted but then there's
10:37 spirits alcohol destroys your liver
10:42 destroys your brain by but it basically
10:45 destroys your entire body by thinning
10:47 your blood toxifying your blood because
10:50 it removes and displaces the pure oxygen
10:53 in your blood supply which is why you
10:54 get loopy in your head but that little
10:58 loopy nose can be kind of fun right it
10:59 makes life sort of a cartoon takes the
11:01 edge off for sure
11:04 and what's interesting about it is if
11:07 you think about it if you could take the
11:10 edge off without toxifying your body no
11:12 one would be up your ass about it right
11:14 oh well you know they've had a really
11:16 stressful week or whatever yeah they
11:18 should do that one thing get a massage
11:20 or watch their favorite television show
11:22 or whatever now obviously all legal
11:25 drugs are the kind of drugs that give
11:28 you X amount of differential change to
11:32 your body right now you can drink a lot
11:35 really fast and get totally shit-faced
11:36 right where do we put those other things
11:41 you can ingest that really rip you apart
11:45 those are called the illegal drugs
11:48 cocaine heroin marijuana and you know
11:53 it's sort of a natural way to get to
11:55 what you would get through alcohol
11:57 obviously it doesn't destroy your liver
11:59 and people don't typically get super
12:02 angry by adjusting it because it doesn't
12:04 Rob the thickness of your blood nor the
12:07 oxygen supply in your blood
12:09 there's all these conflicting studies
12:12 about marijuana which is really tough
12:13 for me because on one hand you'll have a
12:16 bunch of reports about hemp oil killing
12:19 cancer cells cells another one you'll
12:21 get is stories about you know the
12:25 government essentially taking over the
12:30 genetic purity of marijuana and you know
12:35 sliding something in it's not good for
12:36 us you'll have you know studies that
12:40 were done in the 80s in the 70s saying
12:42 it can't hurt you at all and a more
12:44 recent studies saying that it can really
12:47 put ant trails in your brain and rip you
12:49 up for me even if you know I have no
12:53 experience with the hemp oil thing but
12:55 I've heard people say it does miracles
12:57 so if you're suffering from cancer you
12:59 might want to research all alternatives
13:01 see my episode I believe 17 on cancer
13:03 but my only concern with any type of
13:06 drug that takes away your sharpness is
13:09 that get your life completely on
13:12 autopilot before you roll down that path
13:15 because
13:15 you need everything that all your
13:18 faculties to see opportunity and to
13:20 build skills in most cases now there's
13:23 again there's a handful of like you know
13:26 musicians and whatever you an artist
13:27 perhaps that can use this stuff and it
13:29 augments what they're doing but if
13:32 that's the case then you better be
13:33 really good at what they do because
13:35 that's going to be your probably the
13:36 limitation that you're going to run
13:37 under right with the big drugs right
13:41 I've never done heroin I'm not even sure
13:43 I've ever been in the same room with
13:44 heroin if I have I was unaware of it I
13:48 carry cocaine twice 1 I put it on my
13:51 tongue which made my tongue totally numb
13:54 for about probably 10 inches down my
13:56 throat it was like I was trying to eat a
13:59 fish hole and the other one was I
14:03 sniffed a tiny line once did nothing
14:06 give me whatsoever oh man how did you
14:08 feel good I'm like nothing man
14:10 don't eat it but Opium's opiates coca
14:18 leaves you know I've got friends of mine
14:21 who do coke who have done coke I should
14:23 say who've said it brings made them
14:25 really mellow and other friends that get
14:28 totally high as a kite so I can't quite
14:32 figure out that drug in terms of the
14:34 heroin they always say you're chasing
14:35 the dragon and it's the first trip that
14:40 you take you get to ride the dragon and
14:42 then I guess the way it goes is that
14:44 every trip you have after that you can
14:45 you can never get them back
14:48 I'll say acids a very similar situation
14:51 although you know acid is not addictive
14:54 you know you may want to do it once a
14:57 year but that's not because you're
14:59 addicted to it physically you're just
15:01 interested in the experience and
15:02 expanding your mind and taking what
15:04 you've learned in the last 12 months and
15:05 throwing it into the projector and
15:08 seeing it bigger inside your brain
15:10 perhaps you become more spiritual and
15:13 you would love man more and it just
15:16 helps you connect the dots a little bit
15:18 better
15:20 now when I was in the Bay Area ecstasy
15:23 exploded MDA exploded while I was here
15:26 in SoCal and up in the Bay Area we had
15:29 lots of deaths for just bizarre
15:32 overdoses from these rape drugs rapes
15:35 are huge in the barrier when I was up
15:37 there you know San Francisco for those
15:41 of you don't know all those south of San
15:44 Francisco for 12 years very interesting
15:48 place so there's that second-tier up
15:53 drugs our bodies have completely
15:59 different abilities to resist drugs all
16:05 right if we don't understand that about
16:07 drugs then we're going to judge others
16:09 the way we would judge ourselves and
16:11 that is not going to work you can't say
16:15 well I'm not addicted to it so you
16:16 shouldn't be you shouldn't say that
16:18 because it doesn't work like that I have
16:23 dated girls who have families that are
16:25 alcoholics all of them including the
16:27 girl of course you don't know that when
16:28 you're dating them if you realize they
16:30 have the gene that one doesn't get
16:32 hungover in the morning which is bizarre
16:35 I'm very glad that I get hung over
16:38 because that kept me from becoming an
16:39 alcoholic but they also can just drink
16:43 and drink and drink it takes forever for
16:45 them to get the slightest bit drunk
16:47 but there might also be something that's
16:50 been probably fairly untracked which is
16:53 your genetic ability to deal with life
16:56 and I don't mean that as a criticism
16:59 because let me throw you a lifeline when
17:02 it comes to that sort of criticism as
17:04 I've said several times on the show on
17:07 different episodes we're not built for
17:10 this sort of life this faux intellectual
17:14 you know level that we've been able to
17:18 bring ourselves to and maybe legitimize
17:20 is not the way that our genetics are
17:23 currently predisposed we're supposed to
17:26 be very relaxed we are supposed to men
17:30 supposed to get up and hunt get the food
17:31 bring it to the ladies
17:33 perhaps in some cultures the men cook
17:35 the food as well I would definitely be
17:38 one of those the big barbecue going let
17:41 the ladies have the children raise the
17:44 children I mean you think about it you
17:45 you carry the child it's in you know
17:48 it's 50% intellectually your property
17:51 but 100% your physical property you've
17:53 made it with your flesh and blood and
17:56 it's up to the man to feed you and
17:58 clothe you and shelter you that's the
18:02 that's the primal crow Magnum
18:05 methodology that we're probably more
18:07 genetically predisposed to do so now you
18:09 throw people into these high-velocity
18:12 societies and a bunch of stuff happens
18:15 strange I've known several women in my
18:19 lifetime say probably three which four
18:22 what about to say I think is high who
18:25 are unable to drive on the highway
18:27 because they get too much anxiety from
18:30 getting in the car and driving sometimes
18:33 they're really petite people and cars
18:35 are always built bigger than them and so
18:37 they can never really see the mirrors
18:38 properly they're nervous and if you
18:40 think about it I Drive a car and I'm a
18:44 grown man so the car feels normal to me
18:46 but if someone said you got to drive
18:47 this this m1 Abrams tank to work every
18:51 single day and you you know you're
18:52 inside this box and you're looking
18:54 through video cameras and a slit you
18:57 know a man would get nervous trying to
19:00 get out of the driveway and not run over
19:02 the the cars parked around the house and
19:03 kill a child running across the street I
19:05 mean it would just be crazy so you take
19:08 society being overgrown and
19:11 disproportionate to the genetics of
19:13 mankind and you might understand why
19:16 people get really full of anxiety you
19:20 know small people have to be very
19:22 careful in eating sugar you just can't
19:26 just you know a peanut Buster parfait
19:28 and expect to sleep well at night
19:31 because your body will metabolize that
19:34 into energy and energy if not expelled
19:36 through physical labor will turn into
19:37 thoughts and just an overall jitteriness
19:41 which if you don't have explained to you
19:43 while you're feeling that way will start
19:46 to wander right
19:47 little tiny nuggets of thoughts that are
19:49 bad the little thread in the sweater
19:51 that's bad
19:54 you'll start pulling it out just as a
19:56 matter of addiction and you'll start
19:58 manifesting weird realities that don't
20:00 exist well if you could put something in
20:05 your body in your bloodstream to numb
20:06 yourself out it quiets the voices in one
20:11 way or another right the last category
20:14 that I think is a major category I think
20:18 used to be really rare and I no longer
20:20 than gets rare I don't have any real
20:23 numbers and I'm not sure anyone else
20:24 does but there are individuals who for
20:31 whatever reason genetically they are
20:34 wired to be very uptight somehow lines
20:40 crossed they're compulsive could be
20:45 today it could be the millions of shots
20:47 that people get but I have friends of my
20:48 there my age or older that can't sit
20:51 still in a chair friends of mine they
20:56 can't stop talking it's almost as if
20:57 they believed if they'd stop talking
20:59 their mouth will stop working or and
21:00 it's Douglas Adams used to say and you
21:03 can see why they would like any type of
21:05 drug to calm them down how many times
21:07 have you guys seen those episodes where
21:09 someone is suffering for it on internet
21:12 the guy did suffering from Parkinson's
21:14 he's shaking horribly he's unable to
21:17 speak and he get they give him a huge
21:21 shot of weed like a big bong shot and
21:28 within a couple minutes the guy is
21:31 completely relaxed he can hold his hand
21:34 out and it doesn't move I saw one the
21:38 other day it was just absolutely
21:39 touching the guy stopped shaking and
21:43 then he said I could talk wow this is
21:49 unbelievable and then he said can we go
21:53 to lunch I would love to just go to
21:56 lunch and talk because
21:59 I don't go in public much because I
22:01 shake too much I can't feed myself no
22:04 one can really feed me without great
22:07 labor and even if I'm sitting there and
22:09 it all works out I'm having a good day I
22:10 can't speak but there are some people
22:13 that don't have Parkinson's that just
22:15 simply have this really tight wiring
22:18 you've probably met one person like this
22:20 and for whatever reason they're that way
22:24 we don't yeah I don't think there's any
22:26 room for you know blaming them now you
22:29 do know folks that whatever reason you
22:32 believe that they were normal and they
22:34 became a Tweaker they got strung out and
22:36 then they behaved like this they're
22:38 tight they're wound up the can't hold
22:39 still maybe there's still a little bit
22:41 higher or whatever but until you can
22:45 certify that they were completely normal
22:47 prior to getting addicted
22:50 maybe the addiction was a result of the
22:52 only way they can quiet themselves so
22:55 that's the other extreme now when I talk
22:58 about the second tier of this whole
23:00 thing with people that feel stressed
23:04 there is essentially the environment
23:07 that can be too stressful like I said
23:09 you're you're from one of the ones I see
23:13 I've seen a couple times in my lifetime
23:15 or people that have emigrated up from
23:17 Mexico the females especially who have
23:22 had wonderful lives in Mexico their
23:23 relatives have right and so they're used
23:27 to this calm beautiful world it's really
23:30 more in balance with humanity and then
23:33 they get sold the promise that the big
23:35 cities got every got all the money which
23:37 it does technically speaking but it was
23:41 all like a ruse they were sold on
23:45 something they really didn't need but
23:48 they come up here and then they get
23:50 freaked out but they don't admit they've
23:52 got freaked out and so they try to bluff
23:54 but in the end it kind of comes out in a
23:56 really strange way so the reason why I
24:00 mentioned this other other area here
24:02 this sort of second-tier to the second
24:03 tier is that you know a lot of this
24:08 addiction is either you're trying to get
24:12 an X
24:12 - hi you're already happy with life you
24:14 just want to go up higher that's usually
24:17 how it starts how many people you know
24:20 live in the past right they can't listen
24:23 to modern music
24:25 they can't ingest anything that's modern
24:28 and it's not because they dislike modern
24:30 music I mean there's a million reasons
24:31 to dislike modern stuff but it's just
24:35 what they remember his life was easy in
24:37 life was good when they were young and
24:40 they want to go back cuz in the end you
24:44 know you're with your family members
24:47 that are perhaps now past but nothing
24:49 nothing else
24:50 you didn't pay all the bills you had a
24:52 community around you that you built into
24:54 that you grew up into that was safe even
24:57 if there's a couple andriy people in the
24:58 neighborhood but sometimes life can get
25:01 really rough depending on how much you
25:03 bite off - meaning depend on how you
25:06 turn the corner and what you find there
25:08 you could be with someone you think is
25:11 wonderful for you and they turn out to
25:12 be horrible for you I want you to go
25:15 back to the sine-wave that we talked
25:16 about the very beginning this beautiful
25:19 frequency that is you well think about
25:23 how many things can interrupt the
25:26 beautiful flow and balance of that
25:28 algorithm things that have nothing to do
25:31 with you things that are just an
25:34 attribute of society and all you want to
25:37 do is get back to the beautiful
25:38 frequency that you were born with
25:41 whether perhaps you achieved at one
25:43 point or perhaps that you see in other
25:46 people if you're born in a bad situation
25:49 think about it you would only know the
25:51 bad situation maybe what's normal for
25:53 you is a nightmare for others but
25:59 eventually you join society and you
26:00 start to compare stories and you start
26:02 to remap in your brain what was good and
26:04 what was bad how many of you have a
26:07 predisposition that your parent gave you
26:10 your parent was a particular way it
26:12 wasn't really a good way not to see you
26:16 about your parents about person by any
26:17 stretch but they had a bad habit and you
26:21 had that bad habit now because you maybe
26:23 have a genetic trigger or weakness to it
26:25 I think that happens to all
26:27 with us but they start behaving a way
26:29 that their genetics deals with society
26:31 deals with the sign of the time sort of
26:33 thing you know whatever is going on
26:34 right now in society and you tend to
26:38 grab that you grab a hold of it because
26:40 when it's done in front of you hundreds
26:42 of thousands of times a day so it
26:44 becomes the norm becomes how you react
26:46 to stress or whatever and then later you
26:50 start to meet other people and date
26:51 around you start to go by gosh I I've
26:54 got this attribute I need to stop if you
26:58 can stop it or slow it down considerably
27:01 you can go on live with life the little
27:04 frequency that used to be really smooth
27:06 well it's not quite pristine anymore I'm
27:09 not sure any of us really have a fully
27:11 pristine frequency but what if you're
27:14 not able to subdue it what if life was
27:19 great but then you get hit by a Mack
27:20 truck as a metaphor something amazing
27:25 happens to you that shouldn't have
27:26 happened to you something bad now we
27:30 never worry about the times when we get
27:32 the big job promotion or the great
27:34 opportunity we get our break in life we
27:39 just take it and run but man when you
27:43 get knocked the F out by something bad
27:49 it's hard to deal with it right but you
27:54 want to re you want to fix yourself and
27:56 move on well if you can fix it then you
27:59 fix it but if it's going to take a
28:01 little while and you're going to have to
28:03 eat crow or you're going to have to just
28:05 be in someone else's crap that has
28:07 nothing to do with you you didn't do
28:09 anything you perhaps you're married with
28:10 kids and your spouse walks out on you
28:13 and I mean walks out you don't even know
28:15 where they worry where they are anymore
28:16 you can't chase them legally because
28:18 they left the country disappear as far
28:20 as you know they're dead but it deep
28:24 down you know they're not maybe they
28:25 left you a little note and now you have
28:28 really a lack of resources to deal with
28:31 what you're responsible for so you you
28:34 got hit hard
28:37 the interesting thing about addiction
28:38 for the chronically addicted is that in
28:42 most cases they all have a story right
28:45 and I'm not saying this is a bag I'm not
28:50 saying you're a bad person if you have a
28:51 story because there are reasons why
28:53 things begin sometimes I've had friends
28:57 of mine that have had really bad
29:01 childhoods parents that didn't love them
29:05 parents that told them that they
29:07 literally should have aborted them and
29:10 they pulled through they didn't get
29:12 addicted to anything they just lived and
29:16 dealt with the psychosis of being
29:18 rejected by someone that should have
29:21 unconditionally loved them and I've had
29:24 friends of mine that lost their jobs and
29:28 committed suicide with spouses and
29:31 children being left in their wake
29:35 young kids but their self-worth was
29:41 never restored after a corporation that
29:43 they should have known didn't care about
29:45 them cut them off but they didn't have
29:48 one they didn't tell us that they were
29:51 feeling so down and two we didn't know
29:55 how critical it was to jump in and
29:57 really grab them by the shoulders and
29:59 stare them in the our eyes and give them
30:01 a hug and say we're here with you until
30:04 you you know well we're here with you
30:06 forever but we're going to be here with
30:08 you in a very special way until you get
30:11 back up on your feet what's really
30:14 strange about the last 12 months of
30:16 Facebook is that suicide is becoming a
30:22 big deal a lot of people are pulling the
30:27 trigger on themselves just happened in
30:30 my hometown that guy that everyone
30:32 thought was okay sitting out behind his
30:35 house with the gun in his hand two
30:39 police officers come up to him who know
30:41 him because it's a small town and
30:43 they're they're not quite sure what to
30:44 do
30:45 I don't know if he is violent violent
30:49 towards others violent towards himself
30:50 they're trying to talk him down
30:53 unfortunately in a small town I think
30:55 that there's not there's not a lot of
30:58 experience with massive depressions so
31:03 you know a cop walking up on a
31:05 pedestrian in that situation depending
31:09 on their age there's not a tremendous
31:11 amount of wisdom there whereas if you
31:13 come to the big city and buy time you're
31:14 30 years old you've seen it all men but
31:18 they try to get the gun out of his hand
31:19 one of the officers even tried to tase
31:22 him and he missed and the the gentleman
31:28 turned the gun on himself and killed
31:30 himself that's the extreme right one
31:34 side offense we have people that are
31:36 able to deal with it or they're not
31:38 challenged on the other side offense you
31:41 have people that have almost never not
31:44 known a challenge they've never had
31:46 their life be normal and so the resolve
31:52 there is some people take their lives
31:55 and some people don't
31:57 addiction is also something that happens
32:00 with people that I think are very
32:01 isolated you could actually physically
32:05 live with someone else but if the
32:07 interaction level is in high and of a
32:09 certain level of quality the individual
32:12 still feels completely isolated and
32:13 alone and that's where the drinking
32:17 starts so the drugs start it's hard as
32:21 far as I understand it's pretty damn
32:23 hard to do heroin without someone
32:24 finding the tracks on your body cocaine
32:29 yeah you can hide it up to a point but
32:31 it does show itself in various physical
32:35 traits you get nervous you get all up
32:39 you know wound up sometimes you get the
32:43 sniffles you know weed well you know
32:49 you're pretty wiped out when you're on
32:51 it your eyes change alcohol you can
32:54 smell it smoking you can smell in
32:58 general
32:59 I could never hide cigar addiction trust
33:02 me one thing that I have discovered and
33:05 seen happened several times for folks is
33:09 that addiction because it is the result
33:13 of isolation you're in a bad situation
33:15 and you have no one you could talk to
33:17 you that you believe matters how many
33:22 times if you call your parents and your
33:24 parents said you know it's all going to
33:26 be ok and you're a great person and
33:29 dadada and you don't care about their
33:32 opinion it does not mean you don't love
33:35 them dearly it's just the validation
33:38 that you're looking for it needs to come
33:39 from someplace closer to what you're
33:42 struggling with so sometimes a friend
33:45 their opinion can mean more than your
33:48 own flesh and blood the opinion of a
33:51 loved one well there's nothing more
33:53 intense than that because it is the
33:56 person we have chosen to approve of and
34:00 to have them approve of us unfortunately
34:03 we pick partners sort of with a
34:06 willy-nilly bizarre process don't we
34:09 because it's almost like this this
34:15 juxtapose of logic and that we want to
34:20 find that person quickly but if we're
34:22 really to find someone that's really
34:24 good for us it should take quite a while
34:25 don't you think
34:27 now some people are really lucky and I
34:30 cheer them on and I'm envious in a very
34:32 positive way like good you know when I
34:36 see a good couple together I get really
34:37 happy because I'm like good make babies
34:40 make happy babies educate them have fun
34:43 teach them about what's really important
34:45 in life because whatever you think is
34:46 important seems like you got the secret
34:49 sauce I do not have the secret sauce but
34:55 let's go into other addictions because
34:56 they're multifaceted aren't they there
35:01 are people who twirl their hair
35:03 addictively pick their skin addictively
35:09 once you find out that sex feels good
35:11 well your if you have an addictive
35:14 personality or you're in a particular
35:16 zone in your life a particular isolated
35:18 time in life where you're not feeling
35:21 wonderful and you've got this little
35:23 freebie thing you can do by yourself or
35:25 with somebody else or you could pay
35:26 someone else to do it you might just
35:31 gravitate to that we talked about on
35:34 this show how we resonate with other
35:36 human beings and there's obviously a
35:38 tremendous amount of truth to that I'll
35:42 give you some examples you used to swear
35:46 a lot and you managed to fight it
35:49 managed to for the most part beat it
35:53 you'll swear that much anymore and then
35:56 you travel someplace back to your old
35:57 buddies your old girlfriends or whatever
36:00 and you they're swearing a lot for
36:03 whatever reason you see a movie this
36:04 wears a lot do you hang out which is
36:06 random people that swear a lot all of a
36:08 sudden as a matter of tribalism and
36:11 perhaps legacy habits all that hard work
36:15 is flushed and you come away from that
36:17 world swearing no it's not that you
36:21 can't go back to your old ways and get
36:23 rid of it but for that time you're
36:25 almost embarrassed that you're swearing
36:27 so who you hang out with is important it
36:33 is important if isolation is essentially
36:38 the kernel moment in time when addiction
36:41 can start whether you be in a crack
36:45 house or something or you're with a
36:46 bunch of people you know doing meth in
36:49 the end that you're with people that are
36:51 probably individually isolated in their
36:54 own brains and you're all together and
36:55 the only thing that you know beyond the
36:57 drug that feels good is that you're with
36:59 a bunch of people that seem to
37:00 understand you and your isolation is
37:03 what is you what you have in common your
37:05 pain is what you have in common and so
37:10 it begins
37:11 but I think you know it's very few of us
37:13 that have probably been in those kind of
37:14 those sort of tribal situations most of
37:19 us if we if we develop an addiction
37:20 we're by ourselves
37:22 and again as nothing to do with being
37:24 physically by yourself it's just in your
37:28 brain somehow they're unable to express
37:31 yourself in a way that anyone can really
37:32 hear you they don't reply back to you in
37:34 any way that makes you feel like you're
37:36 being heard could be that you're trying
37:39 to protect your family and friends from
37:42 what you're dealing with if you're a
37:44 father for instance at least in the
37:46 traditional sense of say the 70s or
37:48 before in my home town it was years to
37:54 two times in the day when people would
37:56 drink the rich people in my little
37:58 hometown would have five o'clock hour
38:00 and they collected their cocktail hour
38:02 everyone had a minibar in their house it
38:05 was unbelievable who barely drank had a
38:08 big beautiful bar like a real bar inside
38:11 of his house but he would just sip wine
38:14 maybe once a night maybe but he had a
38:17 whole bar full of everything you'd ever
38:18 want he didn't drink it those are from
38:22 his just the days when he was in his 20s
38:25 he was a doctor so he had money it's no
38:27 big deal
38:28 buying that stuff but the more you sneak
38:31 things that you think you shouldn't be
38:33 dealing with the more that you start to
38:34 impact the your view of yourself
38:37 right almost everyone has ever been
38:39 addicted and realized that that's
38:42 something that's going on in their life
38:43 you start to self critique you start to
38:46 feel bad about yourself and it's the
38:50 unfortunate thing is you do it in a way
38:52 that is hard to shake and what's
38:58 interesting about addiction is that you
39:00 sort of serendipitously fall into it I
39:02 mean what's so difficult about taking a
39:05 drink what's so difficult by eating too
39:08 much now doing illegal drugs well it's a
39:12 little bit difficult to get a hold of
39:14 them sometimes and then you find your
39:15 little supplier and then it's ah oh now
39:18 I have my constant stream of whatever
39:20 the illegal drug I'm taking but what's
39:24 really fascinating is that it's
39:26 difficult to get out easy to slip in
39:29 difficult to get out
39:32 because your original pristine frequency
39:35 of thought and existing in this universe
39:38 as other by been subdued to a longer
39:42 frequency and you're taking depressants
39:44 or it's been super duper energized and
39:49 now you live in this completely excited
39:52 almost Richter scale of an earthquake
39:53 inside yourself and that is what makes
39:57 you feel good you know perhaps if you're
40:01 more into the excited state of being
40:03 then it's a distraction it's almost a
40:06 chemical distraction from life's
40:09 interference algorithms as you've
40:11 defined them the comedian Woody Allen
40:17 who obviously has lived the life that
40:19 some people approve of and lived a life
40:22 to some people have a lot of criticism
40:25 for but prior to his site last 20 years
40:30 of living when he was living back in the
40:32 60s and 70s as this award-winning
40:34 creative writer and comedian and
40:36 director and actor he was very upfront
40:40 about going for psychotherapy for those
40:45 of you are a little nostalgic about the
40:46 past whether you live through it or not
40:49 one of the greatest series on YouTube
40:52 you can watch our interviews with Dick
40:54 Cavett he he interviewed all the Masters
40:57 and their primes even some of the
41:00 Masters like Groucho Marx in his last
41:03 decade of life and they're very
41:07 revealing interviews because one
41:08 interviews aren't these boring pre
41:11 rehearsed questions and answers like
41:14 they are today like if you watch Jimmy
41:16 Kimball or even the last probably 10
41:19 years of Johnny Carson all those
41:21 questions are rehearsed all the guests
41:23 know what questions are going to be
41:25 asked they pre approved of the answers
41:28 any time you see Bill burr tear it up on
41:30 a late night show he has brought his
41:33 comedy routine to the writers of the
41:36 show and they say well if you asked me
41:37 this question I can lead into this bit
41:39 and it'll seem like I'm just whimsically
41:42 writing this on the fly but the guy
41:44 spent months writing that
41:46 taking it on the streets testing it
41:48 little tiny nightclubs and then he says
41:50 it on you know send my live television
41:53 and you think he's just this he's
41:56 obviously a super talented guy but it
41:58 makes it look like he's writing it on
41:59 the fly I'm sure he's very funny on the
42:01 fly but I'm sure it's a little more blue
42:03 the Woody Allen talked about
42:05 psychotherapy and he was a very young
42:08 man visiting a psychologist but he's
42:13 also very intelligent man and so what he
42:16 realized was that he needed to
42:18 constantly find someone to talk to to
42:21 remove the isolation in his life so he
42:23 could hear his own words get a
42:25 reflection session and then perhaps hear
42:29 some cause and effects associations of
42:32 what he's revealed in his session you
42:34 know it's not really the the the goal of
42:40 a psychologist to tell you what to do
42:43 because then become liable for their own
42:46 evidence the reason I mention this is
42:49 that I want you to be aware of your
42:52 isolation when you're dealing with your
42:53 addiction now sometimes you have the
42:56 privilege of just saying I don't want to
42:59 be isolated anymore I've got great
43:00 friends great family I'm just going to
43:02 schedule more time with him but the
43:04 reality is is that there's two things
43:07 some of you are not in a position to
43:09 just go and turn that on now my
43:12 recommendation is trying to find a place
43:14 that you can go to talk to others but a
43:16 lot of times those are bars those are
43:18 restaurants you know not everyone likes
43:22 cigars so you don't have a smoke lounge
43:24 you know but there's yoga there's
43:27 perhaps a gym you know some of that
43:29 stuff costs a lot of money you can
43:32 usually find a friend at a beach a park
43:35 something parks a little weird nowadays
43:37 because they've been used for so many
43:39 nefarious things but usually there's
43:41 some Club you can get a become a member
43:43 of but there's all there's also Facebook
43:47 with your old friends that you can have
43:49 conversations with but let's say that
43:51 you take my advice and you find some
43:54 beautiful places to talk to people
43:58 but you still have to come home at night
44:00 and again regardless if your house is
44:03 full of family and spouses and all that
44:05 good stuff you can still have a lot of
44:08 little micro POC pockets of isolation
44:11 right and what are you going to do when
44:14 you're in that little pocket well the
44:17 second thing you can do which is perhaps
44:19 the way that I have escaped addiction in
44:22 any chronic way is give yourself a
44:27 project give yourself a project that
44:31 overwhelms you that's fun that's a
44:33 complete fun project for you it doesn't
44:37 have to be associated with money what I
44:40 have discovered is in a lot of cases
44:41 people that think that their pastimes
44:44 won't generate money because they
44:46 haven't generated money you just got to
44:48 do it long enough and something comes
44:50 around right I like thinking that's one
44:54 of my addictions for a long time I have
44:58 just been filling up dozens and dozens
44:59 of notebooks with all kinds of stuff
45:01 that the day I die if my family has the
45:06 wherewithal to look through and read
45:07 what I wrote down it's going to be
45:10 interesting it'll be a bit like you know
45:12 prints leaving behind perhaps a thousand
45:14 songs and a vault that no one's ever
45:16 heard some were going to be shitty songs
45:19 that no one likes and some songs are
45:21 going to be so good it's going to
45:24 confuse prints fans of why he didn't
45:25 release the song I created deep thoughts
45:28 because it gave me a chance to say okay
45:31 I think what I'm thinking is valuable I
45:34 would love to hear other people's
45:35 opinions about what I'm thinking and so
45:40 I started cranking out these episodes
45:41 and by God you guys showed up you know I
45:48 got a little bit of a Kickstarter from
45:50 my previous radio show in kala to radio
45:53 with my co-host Kyle but my first big
45:58 boom was doing a moon hoax episode and
46:03 then the second gigantic boom was
46:05 stepping into this arena of Flat Earth
46:07 was interesting I had no freaking
46:11 idea the community was out there for
46:13 flutter no idea at all so when I'm here
46:17 talking to you on this patio I'm not
46:20 inside being isolated and as soon as I
46:25 go inside I've got G's brand-new
46:27 business I've been working on and a
46:31 million other little projects and so
46:34 even though I'm isolated I have things I
46:37 can do with my time and because I choose
46:41 my projects regardless of how difficult
46:44 they get there's usually more positive
46:46 than negative and the only way to take
46:48 the negative and make it positive is to
46:50 work harder on the project so if I get
46:53 stuck I just work until I'm unstuck you
46:56 know if you have an addictive
46:58 personality what's interesting about
46:59 using it that power for good is that you
47:04 can you have a tenacious quality about
47:08 you that can dig into something and hang
47:10 on to it forever that's just you know in
47:12 one way you're viewing it right and so
47:15 why not create a project for yourself
47:19 get into it perhaps it's just a tiny
47:21 little hobby you know I don't know what
47:25 hobbies exists anymore you know it when
47:27 you go to say Aaron brothers or Michaels
47:30 which is a couple art supply stores here
47:33 in California Michaels is typically full
47:35 of older women or their grandkids who
47:40 are trying to learn what grandma used to
47:43 do when I was growing up in the Midwest
47:47 you know was I had my engineering
47:49 computer engineering
47:50 you know video games stuff when I was a
47:52 kid I've sat at home and wrote software
47:54 I wrote paint applications and I made
47:56 musical keyboards and video games I was
47:59 always working on a video game I have my
48:01 school projects that I had to do I get
48:03 other kids school projects because they
48:04 didn't know how to do them I would go
48:06 shoot guns with my relatives on occasion
48:10 I go fishing I was a lifeguard so I
48:14 would do that job I painted a lot
48:19 so it's always something to do there was
48:20 no time for this addiction thing you
48:22 know the whole thing was always this
48:24 this rumor I had read about Prince when
48:27 I first started getting into him I
48:29 realized he and I had sort of this this
48:32 commonality which I think a lot of us
48:33 have which is when you get into projects
48:36 if you can get ones that people can
48:40 understand for one thing I mean like you
48:42 understand a painting you may not
48:44 understand how difficult it was to write
48:46 a paint application on a computer with
48:49 32k and you you know you're able to make
48:52 fonts work when there were no fonts you
48:55 know they might look at that go well
48:58 that's kind of neat I don't know where I
49:00 would use it but but you show them a
49:02 painting of Marilyn Monroe and they're
49:03 like oh my god that's amazing that's
49:05 great
49:06 but the thing I learned about Prince was
49:08 he said that he would work all night as
49:10 a kid because he was making music from
49:11 like the age of 12 and up he'd spend all
49:14 night making a song and getting it all
49:17 right playing all the instruments
49:18 recording it mixing it all that good
49:19 stuff he'd bring it to his friend the
49:21 next day who worked on it for an hour or
49:23 two
49:24 got bored got tired and went home
49:26 because the mom you said so my prince
49:28 would walk around the next day with the
49:30 tape and eventually Prince got a song
49:33 called soft and wet to play on the radio
49:36 in Minneapolis Minnesota well he worked
49:39 his ass off did that and then I got his
49:41 first record deal made for you which he
49:44 stuck soft and went on he didn't like
49:47 addictions for two reasons he said one I
49:49 lose control because control is the only
49:52 way I have any fun in this world because
49:53 my projects slash music so I was
49:56 practicing all the instruments couldn't
49:58 be accomplished when he was you know
50:01 drunk or high the second thing was he
50:05 had no time it no time to smoke a bowl
50:09 and be out for four hours the other
50:13 thing I've seen with addiction which is
50:15 sort of a bad news good news scenario
50:20 has to do with the feeling of utility
50:22 futility you feel like you've messed up
50:26 your life so much that you can't get out
50:28 of the situation you can quit drugs and
50:31 it wouldn't make any difference so you
50:32 stay in the
50:33 whatever your addiction is that's the
50:37 bad news but it's not real news it's
50:40 fake news about yourself you meet people
50:44 that have pulled out of it and they've
50:48 they've done something we have a
50:50 listener I'll let him reveal his own
50:53 name in this particular situation but
50:55 he's pretty upfront about he's had
50:56 documentaries made about himself he was
50:58 homeless for quite a while but he liked
51:02 to draw and when he was sitting there he
51:06 just drew so he may Panhandle for a
51:09 little while but you know he's got his
51:11 little thing out there please any
51:12 donations you can do but he'd sit there
51:14 and he'd draw and eventually someone saw
51:18 what he was doing and I think he sold
51:19 one and people started once he sells one
51:23 he makes more money than he made you
51:25 know per hour begging for change or
51:27 whatever and so he started putting these
51:30 drawings out for people to see and
51:33 eventually he got known for being this
51:36 incredible artist and today he's doing
51:38 album covers he's doing all kinds of
51:41 cool stuff that he dug himself out he
51:45 took us isolation and turned it into not
51:48 just a hobby but a career and I I dearly
51:54 hope that he gets discovered but really
51:57 smart amazing people with all the
52:00 opportunities in the world noticed him
52:03 and now he's like them so if you were to
52:07 ever talk to him about being down and
52:09 out and thinking that you couldn't pull
52:11 yourself up you know from your by your
52:13 bootstraps he would talk you out of it
52:16 because you couldn't deny it you look
52:18 I'm right in the face and even if you're
52:19 like man I'm not an artist you just look
52:22 at you with loving eyes and say but
52:25 you're something there's something about
52:27 you that's amazing your genes didn't
52:29 make it this far unless you were amazing
52:31 and that's the honest truth like I said
52:33 many many episodes ago when I teach
52:36 classes I tell them all in the class
52:39 before we get started and I don't care
52:43 if we run the ghetto you're all special
52:46 every single
52:46 one of you you have to be otherwise your
52:49 jeans wouldn't have made it this far
52:52 think of all the battles and the wars
52:54 and the suffering and the victories that
52:57 your ancestors have truly experienced I
53:02 mean we like to talk about how America
53:05 you know fought through the Native
53:07 Americans and cook East the doors and
53:09 all those wars from Europe and stuff to
53:11 get to where we are today some of that
53:12 very bad some of it heroic but Europe
53:18 Europe has seen 50 times the amount of
53:21 wars if not a thousand times the amount
53:23 of wars that we've seen over here same
53:26 thing with Africa same thing with Asia
53:28 in Eurasia and Russia and hey what if
53:33 you know your skill and you don't like
53:35 it anymore you're bored of it hmm well
53:38 the good news there is that you've
53:39 proven that you have the genetic
53:41 capability to have a talent in the first
53:43 place so just use the the overall arc of
53:49 your abilities to switch careers the
53:54 never too late never too late
53:57 one thing I love in Hollywood is to find
53:59 new actors which is an androgynous
54:02 reference to male and female that became
54:06 actors in their 40s 50s and 60s
54:09 perhaps they were unemployable the way
54:12 they looked in their 30s and 40s for us
54:14 they had no acting skills but they go to
54:16 a few courses they realize they've
54:17 always had a native talent for it and
54:19 they get in that movie or that
54:22 television show because they look the
54:25 part what's amazing to look up is you
54:29 take your favorite sitcom that went for
54:31 like anywhere from you know 5 to 25
54:36 years and there's a few that have gone
54:38 there for a long time look up all the
54:41 actors that have been on there for a
54:42 while and find out what they did before
54:44 they got the job being what they are
54:47 today and a lot of them Oh have
54:49 pedigrees that go back 10 20 years
54:50 they've done a lot of stuff since but
54:53 some of them only did that show or a
54:55 couple pieces before Steven
54:58 Carrie the lead singer of journey even
55:04 though I don't agree with his opinion of
55:05 the ownership of the franchise today he
55:10 was nothing before he became the lead
55:13 singer of journey and now I would say
55:16 there's nothing that can remove him from
55:18 the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame of
55:20 creating some of the best music we ever
55:22 heard in the late 70s and throughout the
55:25 80s journey was a phenomenal band in its
55:30 native form those of you who like Doctor
55:33 Who look up Tom Baker from Doctor Who
55:37 the gentleman that did I think nine and
55:40 a half years of Doctor Who and they
55:44 consider him the guy that really locked
55:46 down the character there was three
55:47 Doctor Who's before him and he's the one
55:50 that made it fun and whimsical and
55:52 unpredictable but what was he doing
55:54 before he became Doctor Who some of you
55:58 noticed some of you don't he was a
56:00 construction worker he literally was
56:04 building buildings and then going off to
56:06 auditions and finally made it and he
56:10 went from zero
56:11 according to societies you know
56:14 scorecard of people who worship
56:17 Hollywood to hero I'm going to tell you
56:20 right now if you don't pick up on this
56:22 already your age has nothing to do with
56:23 that he was not a young tyke becoming
56:27 Doctor Who he was a man becoming Doctor
56:31 Who who was going to support him here he
56:36 is building buildings and he's telling
56:39 people yeah I'm trying to be an actor
56:40 well who's who's hearing that story and
56:43 going oh yeah you totally will because
56:45 this job says actor all over it doesn't
56:47 it you know but he believed in himself
56:52 and he wouldn't did it or he just kept
56:54 trying right the other big one is that
56:57 you know they say you know you when you
56:59 join a a for instance they always tell
57:03 you know the first thing you got to do
57:04 is stand up and say your name and say
57:05 you're an alcoholic
57:06 and I've not met a person who thought
57:09 that was a bad idea whether or not they
57:11 continue
57:12 going to AAA or not is irrelevant but
57:17 the the thing that society never tells
57:20 you is that sometimes when you kick an
57:23 addiction it takes a while now we've all
57:26 had those friends that just stopped
57:27 drinking they stopped smoking they
57:29 stopped doing whatever it is that they
57:30 were doing got work for them and maybe
57:34 you're one of those cold-turkey kind of
57:35 people what I have found is in many
57:40 cases the cold-turkey people they never
57:43 find themselves looking for advice on
57:44 addiction they just kick it to ass and
57:47 they walk away but sometimes we need a
57:50 little bit of time sometimes maybe a lot
57:52 of time but the interesting thing about
57:55 admitting you have an addiction I think
57:57 psychologically is that you get to step
57:59 outside the bubble of your addiction and
58:01 look at it from outside and that's a
58:05 very powerful perspective because it
58:10 allows you to analyze it from a
58:11 perspective but up until that point you
58:15 weren't able to do it it gives you more
58:18 faculties more analysis more data I
58:23 think it's interesting that we talk
58:25 about all the world's overpopulated from
58:26 time to time but then we talk about how
58:28 isolated we are would seem that if we're
58:33 anywhere near an overpopulated state
58:35 then finding other people to talk to be
58:37 very simple I've been approached by at
58:40 least over the last three years with my
58:43 other show especially I would say least
58:45 three males that were not in America who
58:50 had addiction issues and life issues and
58:55 they would write me these beautiful
58:56 messages through Facebook and I would
59:00 engage them as much as I could
59:01 unfortunately sometimes they catch me
59:03 when I'm really really busy but the
59:05 interesting thing happened for all three
59:06 of them just telling me a stranger about
59:12 their addictions about their suffering
59:15 they self corrected and they came back a
59:19 couple months later and said you know
59:21 what I'm sorry I I sounded weak which is
59:26 obviously not how I interpret any of the
59:27 information I interpret that as strength
59:29 quite frankly but they said you know
59:32 just me telling you I got to see my own
59:34 words and I decided that that's not the
59:39 way I wanted to be and so I stopped and
59:42 honestly all three of them stopped
59:45 almost miraculously even if I took them
59:47 two or three months to stop that's
59:48 that's in it that relative to your life
59:51 and time that's phenomenal
59:57 that's super quick isn't it I made a
60:01 habit a really long time ago too and
60:04 I've said this a lot recently but I'm
60:06 going to give you sort of a reminder
60:08 because I've said everything about to
60:09 say in previous episodes I made it a
60:13 habit when I was young to worship those
60:16 people that were in places I wanted to
60:18 be but when I say worship I don't mean
60:21 everything that they did I mean what
60:22 they did right I paid attention to and
60:25 honestly I didn't pay attention to other
60:26 things I'm the kind of guy that will
60:33 grow very fond of say a rock band when I
60:36 was young and but one thing I didn't do
60:40 was put in the effort into finding out
60:43 what their names were in the band I
60:45 didn't put any effort into finding out
60:48 what kind of guitar they play or drums
60:50 that they play where they live or where
60:51 they're touring next I just really loved
60:55 their music and let it inspire me you
60:57 know when I moved to California is 17
61:00 years old totally by myself nowhere to
61:05 run
61:06 how to take care of my own life which I
61:08 had for whatever reason been able to do
61:11 prior because of the bizarre child that
61:13 I had I was working at Walmart in the
61:16 electronics section and this new rap
61:18 artist showed up because I was heavy
61:20 into rap about the time I would say
61:24 Run DMC came on the on the charts and I
61:28 started noticing rap and you know they
61:31 were sort of late comers when it comes
61:32 to New York but for me it was brand-new
61:35 but all these guys were older than me by
61:38 at least 10 years and so was not quite
61:40 accessible in my brain that their talent
61:43 and success meant that I had a chance at
61:46 being successful with my talents and
61:49 then I noticed a new artist in a movie
61:54 called Krush groove I think it was right
61:57 the guy walked into Russell Simmons
62:01 you know fictitious company in the movie
62:05 it was LL Cool J his name is James Todd
62:09 Smith ladies love cool J James Wright
62:14 and he does this little song called
62:16 radio and it was like whoa that was
62:18 dense that was completely different than
62:21 the style that I'd seen out there it was
62:23 aggressive
62:24 he was manly and then you know I got the
62:29 Krush groove soundtrack so I found out
62:31 his name of course they timed it
62:33 beautifully with his first album
62:34 releasing radio and radio was kind of
62:37 goofy you know it was a good he was
62:40 always good about being you know fun
62:42 because that's what lyrics were back in
62:43 those days it wasn't about calm women
62:45 names and bragging about killing people
62:48 so I became a fan and then I found out
62:52 the guy's only a year and a half older
62:53 than me
62:54 and that was huge for me I was like whoa
62:58 this kid was making it like 16 17 years
63:01 old when I finally met him and work with
63:05 him for a year and I've maintained I
63:08 would say a very strong acquaintance
63:11 level with them to this day you see the
63:14 guy and he's utterly and completely
63:16 focused and driven for everything that
63:18 he does he is not ever resting on his
63:22 laurels he's never he's never isolated
63:26 in a way that you know I would like I
63:29 don't know him to this depth but I would
63:31 imagine he's got plenty of things he
63:32 does either goes to the gym he's
63:34 learning his lines he's acting he's
63:35 helping his five kids succeed he's
63:38 visiting his home half the year and does
63:39 you know there's in LA for the other
63:41 half to film a show in CIS LA they came
63:44 up with a second album
63:45 just before I came to California bigger
63:47 and Deffer and it was bigger and Deffer
63:52 it was amazing we didn't think he could
63:53 touch his first album and he absolutely
63:54 blew it away unbelievable but he had a
63:58 song on this album called breakthrough
64:00 and in the entire song it's one gigantic
64:03 verse no brakes he never mentions the
64:05 word breakthrough which I think was
64:07 ingenious but the song you don't have to
64:11 listen to the original song you can just
64:13 find the lyrics for it take a look
64:14 through it but you find out what drove
64:17 me personally but the song is all about
64:20 struggling to succeed and the way that
64:23 people treated him when he got famous
64:25 and when he got successful and just the
64:29 way he observed life and observed people
64:31 who had kind of given up on their lives
64:33 people who had gotten stuck in addiction
64:35 and he essentially used his male gene
64:41 his responsible male gene and what he
64:44 believes to be the responsibility of a
64:46 man and said you know men don't do this
64:49 men fight through all this [ __ ]
64:53 obviously if you've slipped and if
64:55 you're stuck in something is I don't
64:56 mean to you know heap any criticism on
64:59 you whatsoever
65:00 quite the opposite but that said in me
65:04 in motion my attitude towards adversity
65:11 when I looked at how much I was going to
65:13 devote myself to something it was
65:15 maximum when I said how much am I going
65:18 to polish something in the time that
65:20 I've got available what kind of critical
65:22 I am I going to use to look at the work
65:24 that I'm doing
65:24 it was maximum constantly one of the
65:29 greatest moments of my life was to be
65:30 able to tell him that that's the impact
65:33 he had on my life and of course look at
65:35 me I don't have any you know urban black
65:38 appearance to myself so I'm coming in
65:41 there
65:41 long hair telling this guy you know how
65:47 much he impacted and he just looked at
65:48 me and he goes you're the reason why I
65:50 made the music in the first place to
65:52 touch people so let me leave you with
65:55 this idea
65:57 one of the coolest things you can do
65:59 after you kick an addiction is to use
66:02 your amazing intimate knowledge of the
66:04 process to help others kick their
66:07 addictions and what's interesting is as
66:10 you start to see yourself and everyone
66:12 that you help because you are using your
66:14 knowledge to help others at the same
66:16 time you are I would say galvanizing
66:19 yourself against a relapse doesn't mean
66:22 it won't happen I got plenty of rocker
66:24 buddies in mind that you know they made
66:27 their five platinum album was popped out
66:29 and found it very very difficult to deal
66:32 with the fact that just a year ago they
66:35 were able to fill up auditorium with
66:37 20,000 screaming fans and the next year
66:39 they're you know clean carpets it's the
66:44 true story man and they did go to the
66:47 bottle in some cases they lived perhaps
66:50 a decade inside that bottle trapped and
66:56 then the unthinkable came about which is
66:58 that people wanted to see them again
67:00 they wanted to see that old band on
67:03 stage again and they they seemingly went
67:06 from it's over forever this sort of
67:10 destructive rhythm that they had allowed
67:14 to infect their perfect rhythm and they
67:17 had it ripped away from them and they
67:19 went back to their perfect rhythm of
67:20 being back on stage and maybe it's not
67:22 twenty five thousand people maybe it's
67:24 ten thousand some of these guys go to
67:26 big rock festivals and there's 50,000
67:28 and all 50,000 people are jumping up and
67:32 down and screaming to their music and
67:33 the coolest thing about it is two-thirds
67:35 of the crowd are the age of their
67:37 children or younger when the biggest
67:40 thing a musician has to deal with is the
67:42 fact that they think they created
67:43 amazing music which they obviously they
67:45 did but the No Country for Old Men
67:48 algorithm gets ahold of them and they
67:50 think well geez the kids came and
67:51 appreciate real music anymore they have
67:53 to have the music auto-tuned which isn't
67:56 true
67:57 you're absolutely never ever ever too
68:00 old to change your life for the better
68:02 ever don't ever buy any [ __ ]
68:06 otherwise trust me
68:08 let me tell you it's you know it's one
68:10 thing to hear advice
68:11 some positive information from someone
68:13 that perhaps hasn't proven that their
68:14 advice really works if you're listening
68:17 to my voice you're listening to an
68:20 authority on the process either I have
68:22 done it six or seven times myself I mean
68:25 I've had careers where I mean I'll just
68:28 go through them with you I've been a
68:31 professional programmer of all different
68:33 kinds of programming all right I had to
68:36 relearn completely different language
68:38 it's right you know when I was was I was
68:43 24 years old making about 85,000 dollars
68:48 a year in the early 90s which was a lot
68:50 of money back in those days and I wanted
68:52 in my industry was disappearing is being
68:54 replaced by the internet but I had a
68:56 standard of living that required about
68:58 you know 75 to 80 thousand dollars
69:01 minimum white spent every single night
69:05 working four to six hours a night after
69:07 work learning the Internet
69:09 but I was also an artist I'd already
69:11 already had drawn and designed video
69:14 games professionally for Activision so I
69:17 had this programming background I had
69:19 this strong art background but I took
69:21 all my programming skills and I moved
69:22 them into Internet languages and that
69:25 took all my art skills and I moved him
69:26 into Internet art skills and so in one
69:29 job switch I took a little bit of a pay
69:33 cut but I got a lot less
69:35 responsibilities which was nice and I
69:36 just moved straight over and kept my
69:39 income at the same time I'm contracting
69:42 Electronic Arts and this time I was
69:45 being paid to do a little bit of
69:47 programming but a lot of game design
69:51 playing games and critiquing how the
69:53 physics engines were working it
69:56 eventually that built up into a
69:57 reputation I got called in to make the
70:01 music for video games because we ran out
70:03 of resources the resources we had so I
70:06 became a professional score composer for
70:09 video games right after that I got into
70:12 just walk straight into the sound
70:14 effects packages for video games and
70:16 we're talking about you know console
70:20 versions of video games mobile versions
70:22 of video games the little advanced game
70:24 boy used to
70:25 just back in the day then I started
70:27 making scores for those little game boys
70:29 because they had a bunch of limitations
70:31 so I had to write music or I couldn't
70:33 play two notes at the same time but they
70:36 wanted these big anthems that you know
70:38 go long with Madden I did the soundtrack
70:40 for Madden for a gameboy advanced and
70:44 toy soldiers and a bunch of other cool
70:47 games I taught myself screenwriting
70:50 I've been able to write for some legends
70:52 you know the projects don't get greenlit
70:55 sometimes because other factors but
70:57 there's no reflection on my ability to
70:58 write sometimes I'll just write a script
71:02 and surprise the buddy and go boom I
71:03 wrote the sequel to your phone boom
71:05 there you go and if nothing else then I
71:08 got the skills and I get called off to
71:10 meetings to talk about these things
71:12 eventually I got into helping to
71:15 incubate films finding the money finding
71:18 investors working on the scripts working
71:22 on some of the conceptual art because
71:23 I'm an artist eventually I got to
71:25 engineer gigantic things like e-comm
71:28 which to this day runs on my base
71:30 architecture I can see I just go to the
71:32 site and look around like wow all the
71:34 same directory structures are there the
71:36 same flows are there it's probably all
71:38 been reprogrammed but I didn't program
71:41 too many lines of that particular thing
71:43 but I was the one of the chief designers
71:44 with one other guy we're paying some
71:47 company two and a half million dollars a
71:48 month to do the engineering and they
71:50 didn't know what they were doing but
71:53 this street smart coder came in and
71:55 schooled him with another street smart
71:57 coder neither one of us had degrees in
72:00 computer science but I've been able to
72:03 take a hobby that I've had since
72:06 childhood
72:06 working in electronics because my father
72:08 was really smart in electronics and now
72:11 I've been able to engineer hardware and
72:14 I've been able to write software for a
72:16 buddy of mine who created a an LED hat I
72:19 was able to write all of his
72:20 microcontroller software and just give
72:22 it to him I was supposed to get points
72:25 in the company but he's still struggling
72:28 with that venture himself but if I'd
72:31 ever said I was too old to do something
72:33 you know you had to get in early my
72:35 buddy who became the legendary rock
72:37 a drummer he told himself at 16 years
72:42 old that if he wasn't famous by night by
72:44 18 years old excuse me he would be he
72:48 wouldn't have a chance he actually
72:50 bought a guitar first didn't like it his
72:53 buddy had a drum set that he didn't like
72:54 and so they swapped instruments his
72:56 buddy became a fantastic guitarist and
72:58 he became a fantastic drummer weird
73:01 right they switched instruments and then
73:03 there were lifes were launched everyone
73:07 that you admire in the world you should
73:08 look up their entire history yeah some
73:10 people were lucky Steven Spielberg - got
73:13 the right skills with the right father
73:14 to help him incubate his his eye for
73:17 film but by the time he was in his early
73:19 20s he was already a man he was doing
73:22 man-sized jobs within studios and of
73:24 course he became an amazing director
73:26 okay so that guy's an exception but I
73:30 tell you what 98% of everyone you admire
73:33 struggled up to the point they had
73:35 success and perhaps they struggled after
73:37 they had their success and then they
73:38 rebound you don't have to be in
73:40 Hollywood or some fancy career to have
73:43 all those paths for yourself keeping
73:46 yourself busy such that addiction well
73:48 your addiction will be your job you'll
73:51 be married to that sector right you got
73:52 yourself your family and your job some
73:56 of you are blessed to have a good self
73:57 and a good family addiction only swims
74:00 into your life because the job thing
74:01 isn't working out mmm okay your family
74:06 did something before you were born all
74:08 of your family members and then let's
74:10 just say you look back at your your
74:12 immediate family your mom and dad maybe
74:14 you can't find something in there that
74:16 you admire but I guarantee you keep
74:17 going back back and back they fought
74:20 they succeeded they won and that's what
74:23 you're made out of you know there's an
74:26 old analogy of Darwinism that's pretty
74:28 interesting it's not really Darwin but
74:30 if you put 10,000 people in some
74:32 playoffs some bowling playoff and you
74:35 say you can only advance if you win the
74:36 game
74:37 you can't advance if you lose one match
74:40 well one person out of 10,000 will win
74:43 that tournament and they will have never
74:44 lost because that's just simply the way
74:48 that it works
74:49 while all of you are that person hey we
74:53 all are we're all the person we're
74:55 everyone that existed up to the point we
74:57 were born one because they're still
74:59 alive so if you doubt your ability to
75:02 get out of something don't you just
75:05 haven't made the decision to do so but
75:08 you can do it right now if you want and
75:09 hey even if you reduce just a little bit
75:12 that's a success too how many of you
75:15 have grown up drinking soda and it was
75:19 delicious you went to Disneyland you
75:22 went to your favorite amusement park you
75:23 went to a concert you went to a picnic
75:25 and they just had Coke your family
75:27 always had my father always had lots of
75:29 soda in the house right when you're
75:31 young you can drink that stuff and your
75:34 teeth won't completely right away
75:35 immediately and you won't be necessarily
75:37 obese unless you're adding more stuff to
75:39 it but eventually your metabolism
75:42 catches up with you it slows down you
75:43 start putting on weight maybe you get
75:46 overweight or something well just cut
75:49 down on the soda drink iced tea it's got
75:52 a flavor try not to get it all sweetened
75:55 up but even if you reduce just a little
75:57 bit you've taught yourself you've got
75:59 what it takes to get out of this mess
76:01 you just have to keep going keep turning
76:03 it down keep replacing it with something
76:05 else so hope you feel me hope this was
76:07 useful exploration of your own mind I'm
76:11 always talking about how we're trying to
76:12 rebuild society with this show you know
76:16 I try to come at things from experience
76:18 of my own and authority in a particular
76:20 subject you know it's all one dudes
76:24 opinion right I'm not sure that
76:27 authority is something that really
76:28 exists I'm not sure that someone has you
76:31 know pure knowledge I don't know because
76:33 we we may be living in a different
76:34 frequency every single person may be
76:36 living in a different frequency I'll
76:39 give an example before we sign off here
76:41 what if people who think the world is
76:44 flat by living in a frequency that's
76:47 different than yours but they are able
76:49 to see you in your realm and you're able
76:51 to see them in their room goes back and
76:54 forth but they see it as flat all the
76:57 evidence they're looking for they see
77:00 but you're living in a world where it's
77:02 a heliocentric globe
77:03 and when you look at the world you see a
77:05 globe but because you can see and
77:08 communicate with friends that are in the
77:10 flat world you're totally confused while
77:12 they don't see what you see and vice
77:14 versa
77:15 maybe for some folks physics is
77:18 different and 9/11 could actually happen
77:20 the way the official story described it
77:22 for you your physics are completely
77:24 different it's impossible it has to be a
77:27 demolition pre-arranged spree
77:29 orchestrated a false flag but in their
77:31 world its official story for their world
77:34 they watch them a group Magruder report
77:36 which is the you know the video of JFK
77:39 being assassinated and they don't see
77:41 the the guy holding up the black
77:42 umbrella giving the signal for everyone
77:45 to pull the trigger for then there's
77:47 only a couple bullets and not all the
77:49 bullets that went through the windshield
77:50 hit the curb and all the other shots
77:52 that happen they don't see any of that
77:55 because in their world it doesn't exist
77:57 so maybe the trials and tribulations
78:00 that you're dealing with other people
78:02 don't experience that your happen to be
78:05 in that particular frequency and this
78:08 could be where my episode on dream
78:09 scaping comes in where you can dream
78:11 your way out of this issue when you go
78:13 to sleep perhaps you can change the
78:14 world you wake back up in or perhaps
78:18 it's just a law of attraction you change
78:21 your frequency and then you resonate
78:23 back with the world that is more easy to
78:26 manage who knows it could be a lot more
78:30 going on in this world than we know it
78:33 could be a lot more malleable which is
78:35 why we have Mandela effects let's just
78:36 say some people was always that way for
78:40 you it wasn't always that way but
78:41 there's a group of us and a group of
78:43 them and we sit at the table going Jesus
78:46 is really weird James Earl Jones thinks
78:49 the line was Luke on your father to this
78:51 day but it wasn't there's no on your
78:53 father
78:54 hey bizarre deep vows radio.com for all
78:58 the fees there's video if you're an
78:59 audio audio if you're on video video you
79:02 have two choices youtube or vid not me
79:05 the dummy is about five episodes behind
79:07 only one day if not 10 but the cool
79:10 thing about the dummy of season 1 is in
79:11 its pristine condition someone really
79:14 recently asked him about the theme music
79:15 of season 3
79:17 in the comments what music do I like
79:19 he's like this doesn't really seem quite
79:20 like you you're not wrong if you want to
79:23 see the music I listen to
79:25 or hear the music you listen to go watch
79:27 all just the first you know 30 seconds
79:30 of all the episodes in season 1 and you
79:32 know that's from my catalogue my
79:34 personal catalog which is very very
79:36 different but that's the kind of music I
79:38 dig what I the reason there's two
79:41 reasons why I've gone with royalty-free
79:42 music at the beginning of the show one I
79:46 don't want anyone gagging my videos
79:49 right when I use the soundtrack and the
79:51 first season Europe and the several
79:54 countries in Europe will refuse the
79:56 video to play sometimes I won't really
79:59 won't let you play it on a mobile device
80:01 but I'll let you play it on a desktop
80:04 computer in Europe it's really bizarre
80:05 so I wanted to get rid of that problem
80:07 first and foremost second issue was I
80:10 turn on you know light monetization so
80:13 ads that roll on top of the video for
80:15 the SuperDuper popular ones that let a
80:17 pre-roll go because they're old I figure
80:20 what's what's the deal I'm getting only
80:21 a few folks if you're really interested
80:23 in the topic you'll push through a
80:24 little five-second ad or whatever it is
80:25 right I've collected a hundred and five
80:28 dollars off this show I probably made it
80:31 another hundred dollars in season two
80:33 but I didn't have my Adsense thing set
80:35 up so there's a there's a sunset clause
80:38 in the ad model that you don't get to
80:40 keep your money if you don't collect it
80:41 within a certain amount of time but I
80:42 got all that set up now so they make
80:45 about fifteen to thirty bucks a month
80:47 maybe we'll see how that works for
80:50 podcast you have iTunes Google Play if
80:52 you don't want to go through eating one
80:54 of those devices just get your mobile
80:56 device with your favorite podcast reader
80:57 installed I use podcast addict as I
81:00 always say on my Android just go to the
81:02 website and click the RSS feed link
81:03 either clear at the bottom or the icon
81:06 and lower right and it will tell your
81:08 phone what to do we'll have all the
81:10 episodes if you have any problem let us
81:12 know on the locked Facebook group just
81:13 look up deep thoughts radio it's a lock
81:16 group we do vet your account for
81:19 activity so if you get your if your
81:24 account is a few years old and you only
81:26 belong to a few groups you know like say
81:27 under 50 groups you're automatically and
81:30 don't worry about
81:30 if you're a member of like 800 groups
81:33 and your name is unpronounceable and
81:35 you'll have a couple photos on there
81:36 then I'm not gonna gin so far so good
81:40 hope this was valuable please you guys
81:44 are the authority on this probably more
81:45 than myself so let's load up the
81:47 comments with as much guidance as we
81:49 possibly can
81:49 he'll link other videos that are great
81:51 things that helped you give us your
81:53 scenario where you're able to pull out
81:54 of it anyway take care of yourself in
81:57 someone else and I'll see you in the
81:58 next key thoughts over
