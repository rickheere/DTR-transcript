00:11 [Music]
00:14 so
00:19 [Music]
00:35 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen for the first time in five
00:39 years i am filming in an alternate
00:41 location in my backyard because it's a
00:43 very windy day today it's extremely
00:44 beautiful and warm walked on the beach
00:46 today
00:47 and right around this corner
00:51 is get this little quarantine area where
00:53 it's one tenth of everything else is
00:55 going on around here
00:57 so you might get a little bit of wind in
00:58 the mic but uh should be
01:00 fairly controllable so i got a lot of
01:03 exciting subjects coming
01:04 your way for sure today's subject
01:08 is just one of those subjects which i
01:11 find near and dear to my heart
01:13 because i see it being the flaw of
01:15 others
01:16 around me i debate myself on whether or
01:20 not to engage
01:21 it ever and it's about getting credit
01:25 for what you do it's a weird
01:28 thing it's uh
01:32 you know there's some things that are
01:33 just blatant in your face how to manage
01:36 certain things and then there are things
01:39 like
01:41 getting credit for something but this
01:43 could apply to you
01:44 to help your life get better in terms of
01:46 managing your own desires for such a
01:48 thing
01:49 or we're gonna flip it
01:52 and we're going to talk about
01:55 letting other people get credit and
01:57 making sure they get credit
01:58 and managing people who need to always
02:00 get credit for things
02:03 it can be very nauseating it can be very
02:07 boring it could seem like the priorities
02:10 of the situation are upside down when
02:12 someone really needs a bunch of credit
02:14 but it's a weird thing isn't it isn't it
02:16 weird that we need
02:17 credit for things sometimes you know
02:21 like i did that that was me i did that
02:25 and you want because you toiled
02:28 typically all right i guess we're
02:29 jumping in here
02:31 i don't want to jump in just uh like a
02:33 cannonball into the
02:34 swimming pool but when you are doing
02:38 something
02:39 that is fairly extraordinary
02:42 for your particular history of things
02:45 that you have done
02:46 and this i want you to think about this
02:48 as a little kid
02:50 your your son or your daughter who are
02:52 doing something amazing
02:55 and then you doing something amazing
02:58 let's say your 30s 40s 50s
03:00 you realize every every passage of time
03:03 that happens every decade that goes by
03:05 that bar of what is amazing gets bigger
03:09 and bigger and bigger right well i did
03:10 this when i was young and then i did
03:11 that when i was this and
03:14 so it when you blow things away
03:18 you notice something you notice
03:20 something very in particular and i think
03:21 this is a big part of
03:24 why credit seems to really be desired
03:29 in a particular setup and it goes like
03:32 this
03:33 while you're working extraordinarily
03:35 hard you are noticing that the rest of
03:37 the world's not working that hard
03:39 at least in your perception now it's not
03:41 that they're not working eight hours a
03:43 day it's just you're working 12 and
03:44 you're working
03:46 in some area of creation that is
03:49 tumultuous
03:50 it is unforgiving it is super demanding
03:53 you may be perhaps doing something that
03:55 no one
03:57 has ever done in world history or you're
03:59 doing something that maybe
04:02 no one in your family has done
04:05 no one in your community has done
04:08 maybe in your country and it's all of
04:12 these elements that tend to
04:14 stack up whereby a person
04:17 wants to get credit because
04:20 when you establish yourself as a capable
04:23 person of any
04:24 discipline right you tend to have
04:28 doors open up and it's a beautiful thing
04:32 people be like oh that's the smart
04:34 person get them in here they're the
04:36 first person on the list at our party
04:40 because we want to learn smart things we
04:43 want to know what they're working on
04:44 next
04:46 why are celebrities celebrities
04:49 they have some that are just rich and
04:52 because they have money they have power
04:54 and people will invite them to milk them
04:56 but when they're not rich
04:58 or they weren't rich before we like them
05:01 because they can
05:02 portray fictional characters inside the
05:05 silver screen we like them
05:06 where they can write and perform a song
05:08 that blows our mind
05:10 etc etc a tesla
05:13 who invents things that we can barely
05:15 conceive of i mean do you realize
05:18 how mind-blowing tesla was just as a
05:20 small digression i want you to think
05:21 about this for a split second
05:23 we understand today radio waves because
05:25 we were raised with radio waves
05:28 but this dude created radio waves
05:31 created an antenna to receive those
05:33 waves modulated those into information
05:35 packets such as he could create
05:37 a remote control car in the 1890s
05:41 with instruction sets about how to turn
05:43 stop go backwards forwards
05:45 no big deal today but he's the first guy
05:48 in the world to do it and everyone's
05:50 just like yeah whatever
05:51 might go down a radio show and get one
05:52 of those
05:54 he invented the unconceived
05:59 tesla was a man that liked to get credit
06:03 but he seemed to in my research there
06:06 seemed to be a trigger for him wanting
06:08 credit
06:09 he didn't need to walk out and say look
06:11 at me look at me that's einstein's game
06:14 invent nothing steal everything take
06:16 credit for all
06:17 tesla would only want credit it would
06:21 appear
06:22 if someone else was about to take credit
06:24 for his accomplishment
06:27 or if someone was walking up to him this
06:29 is a big one for all of us right
06:32 let's say that you have done some
06:34 amazing things in your life
06:36 maybe several amazing things in your
06:38 life but you only need one you only need
06:39 one amazing thing for this
06:41 to occur let's say you worked in a
06:43 particular discipline
06:44 of some sort and life goes
06:48 by you're still an expert at that thing
06:51 oh it might have evolved a little bit
06:53 but you know you know
06:54 about 10 minute refresher course you'll
06:56 be back up on everything
06:58 and you were really good at whatever
06:59 that thing was i don't want to keep it
07:01 as generic as possible so you can see
07:02 that thing that you know that you have
07:04 in your brain
07:05 and then you get in a conversation and
07:07 someone starts to
07:08 sort of meander around in their lost
07:12 consciousness with the subject matter
07:13 that you're an expert in
07:16 and so you're sitting there going oh i
07:17 get it this person doesn't know what i
07:18 know and doesn't know that i'm an expert
07:20 in that
07:21 so we'll let them ramble on for a little
07:23 while until we help them
07:25 clarify what it is they prepare to want
07:28 to know i mean you don't even know what
07:29 they want to know
07:30 so you have them talk and then you
07:33 feel like you should validate yourself
07:35 to them in the conversation well
07:37 funny you should mention that is how you
07:38 go you know and you're like i used to do
07:40 that for like 20 years
07:42 in fact i was one of the first people to
07:44 ever do that
07:46 oh really now at this point you'll have
07:48 a fork in the road with the individual
07:50 you're talking to
07:52 this happens at the cigar lounge all the
07:54 time
07:55 you will have someone have an ego
07:58 problem
07:59 and so what ends up happening is you
08:01 tell them that you're an expert in
08:03 something
08:03 and they they absolutely did not walk
08:06 into this room to find an expert
08:08 they wanted to be sort of the hearsay
08:10 expert
08:11 and so they'll just kind of look off
08:14 find a reason to talk to someone else in
08:15 the room
08:16 happens all the time in all the time
08:19 and that's usually your guy in the late
08:21 40s up
08:23 is that kind of fragile little diaper
08:26 bottom
08:26 person right what i find is the kids
08:30 that are
08:31 really interested in and digging in and
08:33 finding out everything that you know
08:35 to add it to their own quiver of
08:37 knowledge
08:38 are all your sort of 20 to 30 guys
08:43 maybe some 40s really hungry in the 20s
08:46 and
08:46 30s they're idealistic they understand
08:49 that
08:50 hey they want to accomplish a bunch of
08:52 cool things in life and so hey if i can
08:54 bum off
08:55 bump some information off some old dude
08:57 smoking a cigar
08:59 let's do it and maybe i'll even change
09:00 my mind maybe i'll double down on this
09:03 venture maybe that guy will tell me
09:05 something that goes
09:06 oh really okay all right maybe i'll
09:09 factor that in
09:09 as i make a decision about where i want
09:11 to major in college or where what job i
09:14 should apply for that sort of thing
09:17 i tend to be very i mean that that's
09:19 rarely occurred where i'm
09:21 actually guiding someone career-wise
09:23 without them soliciting before that
09:25 service
09:26 because you know i don't know the whole
09:27 story right but there's a weird thing
09:30 you can see the credit system and don't
09:33 get it
09:34 confused what's going on in china you
09:37 can see the
09:38 the need for credit in little kids faces
09:42 and maybe you have a pretty vivid memory
09:43 of your childhood and you're like oh
09:45 yeah i remember when
09:47 you know my best friend tried to claim
09:49 that he did what i did
09:51 or she did what i did and then or my
09:54 brother my sister
09:55 tried to take credit for what i did and
09:58 when you do something wrong
09:59 you don't mind someone taking credit for
10:00 it right which is this weird thing i
10:03 mean this is what i'm trying to get to
10:04 with you guys which is
10:06 if we don't want to suffer from this and
10:09 if we don't want to be triggered by
10:10 someone
10:11 seemingly overdoing it
10:15 then we have to understand the emotion i
10:18 will tell you that when i got into the
10:19 game business
10:22 actually me back up one step so you know
10:25 i got in the software business first
10:28 working on turbo tax in 1987.
10:31 and it seemed like that product was
10:34 super appreciated
10:37 no matter who called up on tech support
10:39 phone call because everyone had to do
10:41 tech support when this tax season came
10:42 around
10:43 except for maybe the super hardcore
10:44 programmers which were not going to be
10:45 good talking to the customers
10:47 but almost everyone everyone else and i
10:50 was
10:50 ambidextrous in that realm so anyway i
10:53 was
10:53 that's how i got hired then i went to
10:55 development three months later and then
10:56 just circled around for support
10:58 which i always thought was great because
11:00 i got to talk to customers and find out
11:01 what the hell they liked about the
11:02 product
11:03 but it seemed like turbo tax which was
11:06 going under two different names at the
11:07 time
11:08 was going was being appreciated like
11:10 people were having their minds blown
11:12 with this product
11:12 oh my god i can't believe i just
11:15 whizzywig
11:16 on the screen it's 1987. it prints
11:20 perfect tax forms they don't look weird
11:22 they don't look computerized
11:23 it's phenomenal blah blah blah now fast
11:26 forward a couple years i get in the
11:28 video game business
11:29 first thing i do is draw then uh
11:33 you know about three years later i get
11:35 into electronic arts
11:38 and there was this interesting thing
11:40 that we noticed which was
11:42 you will make an amazing game you will
11:44 work
11:45 two to three years on a game some games
11:48 don't do that i mean electronic arts
11:50 by 1993 you got games that people bring
11:54 in the door that are pretty much
11:56 finished we just need to polish them out
11:57 maybe do some level design and they're
11:59 done in six months
12:00 someone else has already worked maybe a
12:02 year or two before they brought it to us
12:04 so in our brains it's only six months
12:06 old then there are other games
12:08 that take years and years and years to
12:10 create
12:13 and then you will see a kid play the
12:14 game in a test
12:16 session and you know they're just like
12:20 anywhere from 12 to 25
12:25 and they just play your game like yeah
12:27 it's okay it's all right
12:28 whatever it's pretty good yeah you know
12:30 it's like hundreds of people have slaved
12:32 over this thing
12:34 it must be the same thing when you you
12:36 create a film you've got a crew of like
12:38 300
12:39 people and someone says yeah you're an
12:42 avatar
12:42 it's okay sorry you know it's like it's
12:45 this landmark movie
12:47 that makes more money than god and yeah
12:50 you know whatever you know there's an
12:52 interesting thing when you
12:54 uh any of you have known about people
12:56 that work in amusement parks they always
12:57 tell you hey man when you go behind the
12:59 scenes of an amusement park
13:01 you lose a lot of the magic of the park
13:06 it's just a true thing but at the same
13:08 time you
13:09 start gaining new metrics of
13:11 appreciation which is oh my god look at
13:13 how
13:14 you know uh space mountain's actually
13:16 put together when the lights come on
13:18 i've been on space mountain once where
13:20 something
13:21 happened and the ride stops i mean i
13:23 think he's going 30 miles an hour at
13:25 least
13:26 and it just stopped really quickly and
13:27 the lights came on
13:29 and i got to see what it looked like
13:31 inside and it was
13:33 like a bluish gray paint
13:37 and it was [ __ ] and span i was towards
13:39 the bottom
13:41 of the tank that it's inside this bubble
13:42 that it's in
13:44 and i'm looking around it's just
13:45 phenomenal right
13:48 so it's a lot of times when you get into
13:50 games uh you lose the magic of the video
13:52 game like
13:53 you're definitely done playing it by the
13:54 time it releases
13:56 but there's so much appreciation for
13:58 like when you see a great film and you
14:00 look at
14:01 what is it the marvel in game you know
14:04 one and two
14:05 once you understand special effects you
14:07 understand these the writers the
14:09 producers the actors the agents how much
14:11 the agents have pissing matches for who
14:13 can be on camera the most
14:14 da you're just amazed these things ever
14:18 come together
14:18 you know it's really phenomenal so
14:21 there's credit that needs to be
14:23 given for the sake of employment and
14:26 validation
14:28 to get higher levels of employment right
14:31 take a professor
14:34 very traditional job whereby
14:38 you accelerate through
14:42 a particular university you get the
14:46 perhaps highest degree you could get
14:48 you start writing papers it starts
14:50 releasing
14:51 okay great based on the reception of
14:53 that particular paper
14:56 some other college with more money might
14:58 look at what you've done and say
15:00 let's get that guy into harvard let's
15:02 get that guy into cambridge oxford
15:04 uh stanford yale whatever
15:09 it'll also reflect on how you get grants
15:13 grants for free money and never pay it
15:15 back you're supposed to yield something
15:17 but sometimes that that doesn't even
15:19 happen
15:20 okay the weird thing is is if you don't
15:23 have a little bone in your body to
15:27 promote yourself you could be this
15:30 amazing person
15:31 and no one's ever going to notice and on
15:34 one level
15:35 not a gloating level at an ego level but
15:37 on a confidence level and a sheer
15:39 mathematical
15:41 kind of itemization of what you're
15:43 capable of doing you must let the world
15:45 know what you can do
15:47 and if you're like me you've got this
15:50 anti-ego thing it just makes you want to
15:53 puke
15:54 now i can play with you guys and act a
15:56 particular way whatever
15:58 you know i'm this guy i'm really this
16:00 dude right here
16:01 there's some other emotions like i said
16:03 in a previous episode recently
16:05 yeah you know you don't you don't get to
16:07 see me in every single scenario but
16:09 i'm not much different than this but
16:11 i'll come into a room
16:12 i'll come into the smoke lounge or
16:14 something and if you were sitting there
16:15 smoking
16:16 i might have like a funny quip out of my
16:18 mouth just to shock the entire room
16:20 i like that kind of stuff it's
16:22 entertaining it's a non-sequitur shakes
16:23 up your brain
16:24 hopefully i can make you laugh now i
16:27 want to tell you a story about
16:28 working at electronic arts and i said
16:30 this a couple times out of context of
16:32 this exact
16:33 subject and i think it'll be much more
16:35 impactful for you today
16:37 and potentially useful for you in an
16:39 employment capacity
16:41 which also applies to universities right
16:44 so i consult around the hallways of
16:47 electronic arts for six years i'm
16:48 working at other companies
16:50 i've got my own company i'm in and out
16:52 just doing little jobs
16:54 and then i activate full-time in 1999
16:58 like april 1st to be honest
17:02 and i get just battlefield promotions
17:04 everyone's quitting within this online
17:06 division i just keep
17:07 uh assimilating all their employees to
17:10 the point where
17:10 it blew up huge so i got this big ass
17:13 department 55 people
17:15 plus i'm in charge of two other
17:16 divisions which is pretty much the whole
17:18 floor
17:19 uh past the elevator which is a big
17:21 skyscraper
17:23 so probably like 70 80 people at some
17:26 point
17:27 but here comes the new knowledge
17:30 that aol our partner in this online
17:33 ea.com division has lied to their teeth
17:36 in the contract saying that they had 20
17:38 million consecutive players a month
17:40 and that was going to be the basis of
17:41 our online gaming platform
17:43 and they only had two gross
17:46 negligence within a contract i don't
17:48 know why we didn't sue them to death
17:50 but instead they start laying off for
17:53 the very first time in electronic arts
17:55 history
17:56 both studio people where i started and
17:59 the online division where i am now
18:01 now we've got people in in the company
18:05 that don't do anything okay they just
18:09 walk around and talk that's all they do
18:12 it is unbelievable
18:13 you'd pin them down everything that they
18:16 did was just a phone call away and
18:17 they're not even senior people they're
18:18 not vps or anything
18:21 so there was three big layoffs the last
18:24 one was everyone but like a few dozen
18:26 people and that's the one i got clipped
18:27 in
18:28 i ended up working back in studio
18:30 westwood studios
18:32 in vegas so i was flying from san
18:34 francisco to vegas two or three times a
18:35 week
18:36 which i love because westwood studios
18:40 with castle and sperry just
18:43 just a fantastic company but here comes
18:46 the all these layoffs
18:49 and it comes down to that last batch of
18:50 folks and
18:52 through the grapevine i heard this one
18:55 dude and a few
18:56 people like him were kept on
18:59 and i was sitting there thinking to
19:00 myself okay i know everyone i mean i was
19:03 there when
19:04 it was a 20 20 man team
19:07 you know it was my team was the whole
19:08 team and then they ended up hiring
19:11 other vps to build other groups of folks
19:14 and this one guy was just he's a very
19:16 nice person i don't mean to be
19:18 disparaging to him and i'll never say
19:19 his name on the episode of course
19:22 but he managed to stay on because he
19:24 went around talking to everyone
19:26 constantly and i and dropping
19:30 you know this is what i've done this is
19:31 what my department is what i've done is
19:33 the department's done
19:34 and by the time they came down to laying
19:37 people off he had programmed their
19:38 perception of him
19:40 because the higher-ups don't know what
19:41 anybody does they don't even understand
19:43 the technology
19:45 they only understand at a basic level
19:47 they were like oh that guy we got to
19:49 keep that dude
19:51 now here's the funny thing after laying
19:53 off all the doers
19:54 the funny part was
19:58 there was no one left to do any work
20:00 well
20:01 imagine that problem we got a bunch of
20:04 stuff we need to get done oh
20:06 yeah well you know there's no one for me
20:08 to call anymore because you laid them
20:09 all off
20:10 well i thought you you keep telling me
20:12 how great you are
20:14 uh you know once you just roll up your
20:16 sleeves and get it yeah well you know
20:18 sort of kind of
20:18 hey look over there any guy who runs
20:20 away because he doesn't know how to do
20:21 anything
20:23 everything that this guy knew was all
20:24 theoretical and there's there's power
20:27 and theoretical management you know it's
20:30 like i'm sure a lot of people didn't
20:31 understand how the
20:34 saturn 5 was put together before under
20:35 brown bronze like hey dude
20:37 just uh pass me the checkbook and i'll
20:41 get it done
20:42 all right great but no
20:46 let's say you're a good employee let's
20:48 say you really do know your stuff
20:50 but you're a normal human being and you
20:51 don't walk around bragging about
20:53 yourself constantly
20:55 now there's a couple ways to pass the
20:57 information around that i think is very
20:59 very uh productive and you're not going
21:01 to get a bad
21:02 stigma about you walking around going
21:04 hey do you see what i did you know
21:07 one i think it's extremely important
21:10 that you understand if you're in any
21:12 type of technical job
21:13 and this could be special effects to
21:15 programming you need to be priming
21:18 yourself to be
21:19 a manager if you really want a safe
21:23 batch of skills that can last for the
21:25 rest of your life
21:26 you do because being a worker bee past a
21:29 certain age
21:30 is pretty much impossible the main
21:33 reason is is as you get older
21:35 i mean unless you're willing to live in
21:37 us in a one bedroom
21:39 or just you're willing to rent a room
21:42 past 50
21:43 keeping your overhead absolutely at a
21:45 student level
21:46 no one's going to hire you why hire you
21:49 you're old
21:50 if your physical appeal is part of the
21:52 job definitely you're not going to get
21:54 hired because i just take one look at
21:55 you and go yeah that's exactly what i
21:57 want i want this place to look like a
21:59 bowling alley
22:00 nightclub where old ladies are here to
22:03 you know do their thing it's brutal it's
22:05 stupid it's unfair
22:07 trust me i'm not condoning that behavior
22:10 but we all know that's what happens
22:12 but if you're sort of normal
22:16 uh a person past 40 hey your car is a
22:19 little nicer
22:20 your home's got some more stuff in it
22:21 because you've been collecting stuff
22:22 your whole life
22:24 and so eventually your rents more
22:28 your your cost of living is more and
22:30 they don't want to pay for it
22:32 because they can go get the kid fresh
22:34 out of school
22:35 thinking in their mind the kids better
22:37 than you but he's not but whatever
22:38 they'll take the hit in productivity
22:41 because he's way cheaper
22:42 he's a fourth of what you cost so
22:44 management is a great transitional thing
22:48 to move from uh from being a worker into
22:51 a manager
22:53 well how do you make that transition you
22:55 might think this is an
22:56 off-topic situation but it really has to
22:59 do with
23:00 you making sure that the higher is up if
23:02 it's not your own company
23:04 and you have to worry about anything
23:06 your hires up
23:07 need to understand what you do
23:12 and they want to see a couple things
23:13 they want to see you accomplish
23:14 something
23:15 quickly so they want prolificness they
23:18 want to see you
23:20 help others uh on the team
23:23 you may not be in a position to have
23:24 others listen to you or they may not be
23:26 a they may not be a part of your your
23:28 job or whatever
23:29 so you do the best you can but your
23:31 communication skills
23:34 aka you're reporting upwards
23:38 what you do regardless if they ask you
23:40 to do this
23:41 you need to have a regimen and you need
23:44 to figure out sort of the dna of your
23:46 bosses to see if
23:47 okay i shouldn't do this this kind of
23:49 boss wants an update every morning
23:52 or the end of every day this kind of
23:54 boss wants it once a week
23:55 this one wants it once a month this one
23:56 wants it once a quarter
23:59 even if they don't ask you find out what
24:01 the hell they're willing to tolerate
24:03 usually no one has a problem with weekly
24:06 updates or a bigger increment so weekly
24:09 monthly quarterly no one has any problem
24:11 receiving that
24:14 but they need to understand a couple
24:17 things in your
24:18 in your report they need to know
24:21 where you fit inside the progress report
24:24 are you a manager already
24:26 who's just telling them what all the
24:27 employees did
24:29 because eventually that might come back
24:31 to
24:32 to bite you so if you are mentoring your
24:35 employees you are getting them over
24:37 the humps you are training them all that
24:39 kind of stuff that needs to be reflected
24:41 in your notes
24:42 you're going to get credit it's going to
24:44 go into their brain to say wow
24:46 that that woman or that man over there
24:49 is very
24:49 uh critical to our business now
24:52 sometimes things get so
24:54 tumultuous that uh they have to
24:57 let you go but it's strictly financial
24:59 but at least when you're walking out
25:01 with your box of stuff
25:03 you don't feel so bad because you're
25:05 like hey everyone's getting clipped it's
25:06 just we're running out of money
25:08 it's just that simple the department i
25:09 was in was
25:11 expendable reducible that sort of thing
25:15 and there will be sometimes lunacy
25:18 and that you'll have employees that
25:20 reported to you
25:21 already and they think they can manage
25:24 those people or those people can manage
25:26 themselves and they soon find out within
25:28 30 days 60 days
25:30 that they really needed to keep you but
25:32 of course now their ego is involved in
25:34 making the wrong decision to get rid of
25:36 you
25:37 so they they stick with their bad
25:39 decision to prove that they weren't
25:41 wrong
25:42 this kind of crap happens all the time
25:43 and this is stuff you can go get a
25:46 phd in business school and no one's
25:47 going to tell you this stuff i'm telling
25:49 you right now
25:51 this is stuff you only get if you have
25:53 experience
25:55 what i'm trying to do in this episode is
25:58 one go after the psychological
26:01 uh frustrations that we might have
26:02 wanting credit and then trying to figure
26:04 out exactly when we should pull that
26:06 card out
26:07 and two to fortify you within any type
26:09 of
26:10 employment that you might have by using
26:13 the passive methodology of letting
26:17 someone know that you did something
26:18 amazing
26:20 now let me give you the uh
26:23 the standard little lesson of
26:26 using the reference me
26:29 i and we
26:32 it's usually ir or are we right
26:36 there was a famous situation at
26:37 electronic arts where we had this
26:40 i'll just say this guy named frank and
26:43 uh
26:44 his wife was an actress in hollywood
26:47 and there was a lot of uh sort of
26:50 groupies
26:52 at the producer level on electronic arts
26:54 where they always wanted to get close to
26:55 someone who knew someone
26:56 so they could have a golf game with a
26:59 famous person or go to dinner with the
27:01 famous person
27:02 you know it's just you know it's not
27:04 like we all don't want to do those
27:05 things
27:06 if they come around but to artificially
27:08 stimulate it when no one cares if you
27:10 live or die
27:11 it's usually ridiculous so we had this
27:14 guy
27:14 and his wife was an actress and
27:16 apparently his wife was supposedly on
27:18 episodes of frasier but i just
27:19 re-watched
27:20 fraser a couple years ago and i could
27:22 not find any woman to qualify for this
27:25 particular role but i know she's in
27:27 there somewhere
27:29 so he meets one of the big producers out
27:32 of ea
27:32 and that dude gave him a job he has no
27:35 experience
27:36 in video games whatsoever but he gets a
27:38 super senior job
27:40 again he has no experience he has no
27:42 idea he doesn't play video games it
27:44 would be just as bizarre as walking up
27:45 to a
27:46 taxi cab driver and going you're gonna
27:48 run my company you know
27:50 it's not he's not a bad guy or anything
27:51 but this dude was a bad guy
27:54 the first phase of his life was in the
27:55 bay area and what he would do
27:57 is sit in his cube i'm just giving you a
27:59 character profile so to understand why
28:01 the
28:02 rest of the events took place and why
28:03 you never want to be like this guy
28:06 but he would sit in his cube and he was
28:07 talking really loud in his phone right
28:11 and he was saying in his cube really
28:15 loud
28:16 how stupid everyone else was in the
28:19 department
28:20 so here are these people these kids who
28:23 are geniuses right
28:25 geniuses in design geniuses actually we
28:27 didn't have too many coders in-house but
28:30 genius artists and and they just been
28:32 through the machine
28:33 several times this dude's never made one
28:35 game in his entire lifetime
28:37 first day on the job he was saying that
28:41 he was the best i guess
28:44 unbelievable so he made enemies really
28:46 really fast right
28:48 well then he transfers to los angeles
28:52 nobody wanted him in the bay area that's
28:54 for sure so now he goes down to los
28:56 angeles with a little bit of time
28:59 on his record in the bay area and you
29:02 know how that works when you
29:04 start at a new location doesn't matter
29:06 what job it is you could be a teenager
29:08 working at
29:08 dairy queen anyone that was hired the
29:11 day before you
29:12 seems like when you walk in you you
29:14 pavlonianly think they were there
29:16 forever
29:16 and you find out two weeks later they
29:18 were there a day before you
29:20 so when he comes in to la he looks like
29:23 he's a super senior guy
29:25 but he was a blowhard up north and he
29:28 was a blowhard
29:28 down south then ea creates ea.com
29:32 or sorry e-a-l-a excuse me and they
29:35 moved everyone into
29:36 playa vista now this guy is condensed
29:39 with a bunch
29:40 of other geniuses
29:43 but he's still playing the game that he
29:45 is just
29:47 what is it the cat's pajamas he's given
29:50 a huge presentation
29:52 about what his team was working on now
29:55 this whole presentation he's saying
29:57 i i i i
30:00 now once in the presentation with his
30:03 team in the room
30:04 is he acknowledging the fact that he
30:06 works with other human beings
30:09 he's not a programmer he's not an artist
30:10 he's not a designer and he's a shitty
30:12 producer
30:14 so what could he possibly be eyeing in
30:16 this project besides coming to work
30:18 collecting a deep six-digit figure
30:20 because somebody upstairs
30:22 um someone up north wants to uh be on a
30:25 hollywood set which i
30:26 i'm willing to bet never occurred for
30:27 anyone as a result of this guy
30:30 guarantee it because once i got deeper
30:34 into hollywood and i was like so your
30:35 wife was on frasier big deal
30:37 that's probably the first and last job
30:39 this lady ever had
30:40 because they just eat up women like
30:41 crazy and if a woman survives that
30:45 flash in the pants moment she becomes
30:47 legendary and we all know her name
30:48 because she's a household name
30:50 the fact that i watched the whole series
30:51 he couldn't figure out who she was
30:54 pretty good sign that was just a 15
30:56 minutes of fame
30:59 anyway one of my best friends in the
31:01 whole world
31:02 has to write an elevator with this guy
31:05 and my friend
31:06 has a policy and this might sound silly
31:10 but he's told me this several times he
31:11 said you know i have a policy i never
31:13 call anyone any names
31:14 i never have my whole life i just looked
31:17 at him when he told me that i was like
31:18 man you've had a really blessed life
31:19 then
31:20 i'll call you exactly what you are if
31:22 you start to cross
31:23 lines man start to betray the team or
31:26 betray me
31:28 you'll definitely hear what you were at
31:29 that finite moment in time i don't mean
31:31 to say you're that your whole life
31:32 because everyone can rehabilitate but
31:34 i'm not that skilled but he gets in this
31:38 elevator with the guy
31:40 this is my buddy apparently
31:43 he tells the story he stops the elevator
31:45 with the stop button
31:47 having just heard this presentation
31:48 because my buddy's really good about
31:51 passing out uh credit where credit is
31:54 due
31:56 and he turns to the guy and the guy's
31:58 like whoa whoa what's going on and he's
31:59 like
32:00 he says i just watched you give a
32:03 presentation
32:06 taking credit for over a hundred
32:07 employees activities and you never said
32:10 we
32:10 and you never gave anyone any credit for
32:12 anything because i just want to tell you
32:14 i think you're an [ __ ]
32:18 call the guy name right and it was like
32:20 honestly speaking
32:22 uh other than maybe him having choice
32:25 words for politicians
32:28 between you and i right if he were to
32:30 call you or something in real life he
32:32 doesn't do it
32:34 and that guy i guess you know got all
32:35 huffy puffy with him we'll screw you man
32:38 now the guy got fired eventually and
32:40 when he got fired this frank guy
32:42 it was like there was an email a bulk
32:44 email
32:46 of the age of aquarius that this guy
32:48 lost his job
32:49 you know i wish him well but i also only
32:52 wish him well if he can get rid of his
32:55 super acidic personality right that's an
32:58 anecdote about a dude taking way too
33:00 much credit
33:02 now i don't personally have his side of
33:04 the story
33:06 i just know he doesn't have any
33:09 technical skills
33:10 in that area now he everyone who's smart
33:13 could thing things up but his behavior
33:16 in the cube
33:18 up in the bay area telling every his
33:20 first week on the job
33:22 with a blank resume for video games
33:25 saying that everyone in this place is a
33:27 bunch of idiots
33:28 when they're cranking out billion dollar
33:30 products right
33:32 a few million dollars to create billions
33:34 coming in the door
33:36 i mean give me a break walmart walks in
33:39 electronic arts at its peak in say 2000
33:42 to maybe 2001
33:45 we would make a video game and we'd have
33:47 all the big retailers come into the
33:49 company i think we have this little
33:51 showroom where you can play all the
33:53 video games or whatever platform you
33:54 want
33:55 walmart would walk in and buy six
33:57 hundred thousand maddens
33:59 in one setting target five hundred
34:01 thousand
34:02 boom boom before those retailers walk
34:04 out of the room we've already gone
34:06 double platinum and that's before
34:08 gamestop that's before all the little
34:10 guys come in and buy their copies
34:12 that's not even including two or three
34:14 years worth of sales to the store
34:16 online so to say that the kids that
34:20 are paying everybody's bills including
34:23 his paycheck
34:25 are somehow incompetent it was just an
34:27 amazing
34:28 um defective nucleic acid chain let me
34:32 tell you
34:34 but now let's regress back to childhood
34:37 let's think about this for a second if
34:40 you're a parent of any kind
34:42 a grandparent a parent you raise your
34:45 little brothers and sisters or you got a
34:46 neighbor that's got a little kid
34:48 and you're involved you know that
34:52 there's this amazing moment when a kid
34:54 creates
34:55 a drawing with a bunch of crayons
34:58 it doesn't look like anything but to
35:00 them
35:01 it's a work of art and they've brought
35:03 it to you
35:04 and maybe they're saying mommy daddy
35:07 look at what i did
35:09 and it's a moment where your child is
35:11 using instincts inside their body
35:14 nobody said hey why don't you go off and
35:16 draw me a drawing
35:17 and then immediately come and tell me
35:20 how good it was that you did this
35:22 and get credit from me right that's what
35:24 i'm telling you to do go draw
35:26 then come get credit for me and then go
35:27 draw something else and let's just keep
35:28 this going until you fall asleep
35:31 you never say that but every kid does it
35:34 you did it most likely when you were
35:36 little okay
35:39 so it's something that's built into us
35:42 isn't it
35:43 why the hell do we want that we want
35:46 acceptance
35:49 we want to know that we're doing things
35:50 right
35:52 we also want to impress people
35:56 imagine that you're a tiny little kid
35:58 and you're really kind of trying to
35:59 impress
35:59 mommy and daddy with your drawing you
36:02 know it goes from scribbles
36:03 in a kind of a little snowstorm and then
36:05 it turns into
36:07 a big potato head with arms and legs
36:10 coming off the one thing so the face
36:12 is on the potato head and the arms and
36:13 legs come off of it
36:16 then your child has that epiphany where
36:17 they realize there's actually different
36:18 segments to the body
36:20 because they see a stick figure perhaps
36:23 it evolves
36:24 the kid's always looking for the next
36:26 thing to get your approval
36:28 now i will tell you in my own travels
36:32 my experience was a little bit different
36:35 i don't remember that phase as much
36:38 bringing something to mommy and daddy
36:40 and doing it
36:41 one because i think that i had
36:45 grandparents around me that were
36:46 reinforcing me
36:50 automatically and so i i wasn't in a
36:52 deprivation
36:53 standpoint i'm thinking that's how it
36:55 went
36:58 but like i've said several times
37:02 by the time i was nine i was drawing and
37:04 painting
37:05 at you know high school upper high
37:08 school level
37:10 uh skill sets and so what was happening
37:12 for me is that i would go to school
37:15 draw paint do whatever or my private
37:17 painting class when i was nine
37:19 it's the only formal training i ever had
37:21 before uh middle school and
37:23 high school and so i was getting tons of
37:27 accolades at school i was winning
37:28 contests
37:29 uh i mean it was like girls like me
37:31 because i could crank out whatever the
37:33 hell anybody wanted
37:36 i would paint bars when i was 14
37:39 15 years old i paint iron maiden
37:43 album covers on walls and huge banners
37:47 for the movie theater downtown
37:48 on giant sheets you know so i was always
37:51 doing something crazy i'd paint a
37:52 business uh
37:54 just just a ton of stuff i got to roam
37:56 around school and do
37:58 christmas decorations on the walls or
38:00 you know just a ton of stuff okay
38:02 so that automated society towards me
38:06 didn't need the parents to say a word
38:08 which is good because they didn't
38:12 now i'll tell you a a funny story
38:15 because there's a little twist to this
38:16 thing
38:17 let's say that you make the decision in
38:19 your life at some point
38:20 to not go and solicit credit you're
38:23 going to live in the shadows and enjoy
38:25 living in the shadows
38:27 and your reward will simply be that
38:30 people
38:30 enjoyed what you created and for
38:32 instance you could write a book under a
38:34 pen name you could create a movie under
38:36 a pen name
38:37 whatever it is create a piece of artwork
38:39 something an invention
38:42 and just happy that people ended up
38:44 using it okay
38:46 it's very big of you first to do that
38:49 i should say you know in to the degree
38:51 you can actually hang on to that
38:52 regiment your whole life
38:54 you are a special human being you really
38:56 are
38:57 now i had a situation where i
39:00 had and i mentioned this a couple times
39:02 but i figured out how to create murals
39:04 on the ground or on hard surfaces
39:07 using black cat smoke bombs
39:11 very specifically that brand because all
39:12 the brands
39:14 don't yield the color that the outside
39:18 ball actually says and even black hat
39:20 has a few colors that go the different
39:21 way
39:22 but that's okay and so i got it into my
39:26 head to
39:27 do the statue of liberty on a
39:29 racquetball i'll put the picture in the
39:31 thing for those of you on the
39:33 podcast but i i
39:36 totally planned this out now my hometown
39:38 in kansas i'm flying in from california
39:40 to do this i'm using my money i bought a
39:41 case a bottle uh
39:42 bla of sorry smoke bombs have the kids
39:45 help me sort it out so they're all
39:46 involved it's really cool
39:49 and so the next morning i actually
39:50 called the newspaper and i said hey i'm
39:52 going to be doing this mural
39:53 on the racquetball one of the
39:55 racquetball things
39:58 i guess that's what it is you've seen
40:00 these things 100 times
40:02 once you come down and take some
40:03 pictures it'll be cool get the making of
40:05 it and then you'll get the whole thing
40:07 well the brilliant newspaper didn't come
40:10 down
40:10 until much much later like days later
40:13 but i'm painting the statue of liberty
40:15 and it's like um
40:17 i think the minimum height was like nine
40:19 feet high so it was
40:20 kind of hard and they're they're you
40:22 know these things are on fire so you
40:23 have to
40:24 and they have false uh
40:27 they have duds that actually blast the
40:29 fire out on your finger so it goes
40:31 through the wall and starts just
40:32 blasting your fingers so
40:34 by the time you're done creating a smoke
40:35 bomb mural
40:37 you've got holes in your fingers i mean
40:38 for real it's bad
40:40 and you've got so much sulfur in your
40:42 lungs it's hilarious but
40:43 some of us really love that smell
40:47 so here's the funny part this is
40:49 hilarious
40:50 i told the newspaper who i was to come
40:52 down and film it but they didn't
40:54 but they come down a couple days later
40:56 and what they find out is that the park
40:58 manager some guy in town poor dude
41:02 he was pissed off that i had pain i had
41:05 used fire
41:06 to burn this mural on the cement
41:09 surface which had this really thick
41:11 coating of gray paint
41:12 that was used to i guess be a better
41:14 surface to bounce a tennis ball off of
41:16 and i you know etched it away with this
41:19 fire
41:20 so he puts out this notice we're gonna
41:22 find out who did this and
41:24 that person's gonna pay for repainting
41:26 this thing
41:27 now the reality is that once the rain
41:29 comes it's gonna
41:30 knock all the ash off and yeah there'll
41:33 be a little bit of a mark but
41:35 whatever but it was a statue of liberty
41:39 i think it was the year 2000 people
41:42 driving by in their trucks honking horns
41:44 they are loving this they kept coming by
41:46 it just kept getting bigger and bigger
41:48 it was a statue of liberty's head
41:49 before i realized she was queen samaras
41:51 but whatever
41:52 but now get this this is freaking
41:54 hilarious
41:56 my junior high school art teacher
42:00 mr bush now good dude
42:04 we had told him that we did this
42:07 and he thought it was funny but he goes
42:09 so this is summer time it's about a few
42:11 weeks
42:12 uh well i guess it's about uh geez two
42:15 months before school is gonna start up
42:16 again
42:17 so school starts up again he's in class
42:20 and he sent us this email
42:21 to let us know that this happened it was
42:23 utterly hilarious one of his students
42:25 well
42:25 the the the class started talking about
42:27 man do you see that mural down
42:29 now the thing oh man that was crazy and
42:31 you know they still can't find who did
42:32 it because whoever did it's going to
42:33 have to pay
42:35 apparently some kid in class said oh
42:38 i did it and the whole class just went
42:41 oh my gosh you did it he's like oh yeah
42:43 i totally did it and did it now he
42:45 doesn't realize it's made with smoke
42:46 bombs he thinks it's made with paint
42:47 which is really funny
42:49 i don't think that was ever quite
42:50 revealed
42:52 but my teacher is looking at this kid
42:53 going oh my god this kid just took
42:55 credit for
42:56 the thing that mark did all right so
42:58 he's cool he's a totally dapper he's
43:00 retired now
43:02 so he takes the kid back in the back
43:04 room and he goes
43:05 okay here's the deal i'm not going to
43:08 tell anyone that you're lying
43:10 but a former student of mine did that
43:13 and uh i know you didn't do it
43:15 and i don't know whatever happened past
43:16 that point but i just thought it was
43:18 really funny that this poor kid
43:19 you know was in the back room getting
43:21 called out by the teacher
43:23 but now it was interesting for me that
43:27 you know credit wasn't the game at all i
43:29 wanted everyone to get a
43:30 sort of a great you know 4th of july
43:33 bump
43:34 emotionally i wanted to test out the
43:35 technique for the very first time in a
43:38 giant format
43:39 i had done i think the year before
43:42 no actually in 1998 i did a giant mural
43:47 in front of my buddy's house that was a
43:49 dollar bill
43:50 where i redesigned it but it was on a
43:53 you know kind of a cement
43:54 ground you could only see it if you got
43:56 up on a ladder sort of thing so
43:58 but i got heat stroke that day oh my god
44:00 it was so rough i had a headache for
44:02 hours after that but the
44:05 the bicentennial or the whatever the
44:07 statute liberty thing
44:08 was a real interesting moment for me
44:10 because it never came out that i did it
44:14 you know eventually i let some years
44:15 pass i started because facebook didn't
44:17 exist but eventually i
44:18 i posted it here and there no one gives
44:20 a crap right which is good
44:22 i didn't care but everyone loved it
44:25 that was cool and a kid liked it so much
44:27 he took credit for it
44:28 you wouldn't take credit for something
44:30 that you didn't respect
44:32 right you wouldn't be like oh i'm the
44:33 one that crashed the car into the
44:35 parked car and left it there and walked
44:37 off i mean no one takes credit for that
44:39 kind of stuff
44:40 so i thought it was kind of a double
44:42 whammy a little bit of an education for
44:44 me personally
44:45 now let's rewind time
44:48 out in this episode to say
44:52 we i think have established pretty
44:54 convincingly
44:56 the credit is something that kids that
44:58 we want as children
45:01 we want personal credit for it there is
45:03 a
45:04 personal validation
45:07 that you've developed techniques that
45:09 are worth hey that's really good you
45:11 know pat on the back
45:13 we also know that it is used as a
45:14 vehicle to get approval from
45:16 people we're super young
45:20 it's people getting
45:23 approval for
45:26 our parents for love when we want
45:29 friends
45:30 we might show them something really cool
45:32 and they want to be your friend because
45:33 you're
45:34 constantly cranking out cool stuff
45:37 that's cool
45:39 so as you see this game continually
45:42 played in an adult
45:44 realm you have to just monitor
45:47 exactly how it's being applied to a
45:49 situation
45:50 to understand the intent of that credit
45:54 i think most people will tell you that
45:56 as you get older
45:58 it's best to let someone else give you
46:00 credit
46:01 than for you to extort it out of them
46:05 one of my biggest gripes with president
46:07 trump
46:09 was his need to constantly tell you how
46:12 great he was
46:14 now i'm not bashing that guy's overall
46:16 performance i'm just telling you that's
46:17 one thing that
46:19 never felt right with me because i've
46:20 decided not to be that kind of person
46:24 and it's unnecessary right if you save
46:27 the free world let's just say that's
46:28 your accomplishment as a political
46:30 leader
46:32 which didn't happen but at least it
46:35 hasn't happened yet today's inauguration
46:36 day
46:37 then you don't need anyone to you don't
46:40 need to tell anyone how amazing you are
46:42 people just will do it for you they'll
46:43 build statues of you they'll
46:45 carve your face in a mountain it just
46:47 happens
46:49 and that's true greatness so
46:52 as an adult when you see people
46:56 try to get credit for things and try to
46:59 link themselves to other people who are
47:02 amazing that's one of the biggest ones
47:03 in la that is
47:05 gross and i try to manage it on this
47:07 show which is
47:08 if i told you i know if knew a famous
47:10 person
47:11 i'm not going to tell you there's no
47:13 value to that unless i've done something
47:15 with the famous person
47:17 that is equally impressive
47:21 right just knowing someone oh i met
47:23 someone so
47:24 you know i met um
47:28 kelsey grammer who played frasier i met
47:30 him at the
47:32 bel air country club i was waiting for
47:34 my car and he's standing there to my
47:35 left all by himself taking off his
47:37 golfing gloves
47:38 and i look over him and he's looking at
47:39 me he's got this kind of smile on his
47:41 face and he goes
47:43 he goes he's like hey what's going on
47:45 and i said
47:46 i know you and he laughed and then he
47:49 came over to me and asked me how my day
47:51 was and
47:52 i was kind of bummed that i was waiting
47:54 to get my car to leave it'd be nice to
47:56 meet him when i can sit and chat with
47:57 him but that was just me meeting him but
48:00 i did nothing with the guy
48:02 just it was a it was a happenstance
48:04 situation okay
48:07 but if i meet all these celebrities and
48:08 help build their brands and help them
48:10 get jobs on snl
48:12 or or debut a product or something well
48:14 then that's something
48:15 i can tell you but i don't need to tell
48:17 you
48:18 in a way that i need you to acknowledge
48:21 oh well that's so amazing that's so good
48:24 you did that
48:25 i'm just telling you just in case it
48:28 helps validate a conversation between
48:30 the two of us or some interesting thing
48:31 we're talking about
48:32 but that's it but a lot of people will
48:35 name drop
48:36 as you know as if you know i don't know
48:39 it is weird like if i went back to my
48:41 hometown
48:43 this is my assumption there's going to
48:46 be some people
48:48 that if i were to be this big name
48:50 dropper and boom boom boom
48:52 they're gonna one if they're mature i
48:54 think they're gonna find me very
48:55 obnoxious
48:57 some people are gonna be those folks
48:59 that are just like tell me another story
49:00 tell me another story and they really
49:02 are cheering for
49:03 my life and all that kind of stuff
49:05 that's a probably really slim group of
49:07 people
49:07 probably a younger group of people even
49:10 if they have an old body
49:11 they're a little younger in the head so
49:13 you got to feel that out and maybe
49:15 entertain but eventually you will start
49:18 getting
49:20 nauseated with the game if you have a
49:22 modicum of maturity
49:24 in you what am i doing well my whole
49:26 life is dropping names constantly
49:29 people i met that don't even return my
49:30 phone call i mean it's like you know you
49:32 don't even know him anymore it's like
49:34 all right if it's pertinent to the
49:35 conversation someone mentions that
49:38 name oh my god i love this person i
49:41 think he or she is fantastic this or
49:42 that
49:43 you can go you know it's funny man i
49:46 used to
49:47 know that person and used to do this do
49:49 that
49:50 that i think works so one of them is a
49:53 mechanical
49:55 sort of resume validation which is to
49:58 ensure
49:59 those that could employ you those that
50:00 will part with money
50:02 understand your capabilities and then
50:06 there's the vanity side of things which
50:08 is perhaps you're just telling a story
50:10 to entertain at
50:11 a room maybe something amazing happened
50:15 i'll give you one as an example this was
50:17 kind of funny
50:18 i think i may have i think i told this
50:20 once one time in a previous episode
50:23 i had you know regular meetings with l
50:26 cool j
50:27 in my north office in la and culver city
50:30 one time he comes in and every time you
50:33 meet this guy
50:34 uh he's got to get off the shoot for his
50:36 ncis la show
50:38 so we would literally wait you know a
50:39 couple hours while he's
50:41 finishing shots and he drives straight
50:43 from there to our place
50:45 and of course he's starving to death and
50:47 he's a very health-conscious person
50:49 he's a monster man and he had this
50:52 i think it was an orange a gigantic
50:54 orange
50:57 and he's starving and so he comes in he
50:58 sits down and we're showing the progress
51:00 i'm always the guy shown in the progress
51:02 and so i'm busy i'm working on the
51:06 presentation
51:08 you know after a while you know that guy
51:09 is so professional it's just no big deal
51:12 but he was eating this orange and he was
51:14 tearing apart this which was massive
51:16 and he has these huge hands anyway and
51:18 so he's tearing apart this orange and
51:19 just feeding himself and i'm thinking
51:21 it's totally normal because
51:23 it's an orange man he's starving to
51:25 death good choice in food right
51:28 well then he leaves it's cool we're
51:30 going on about our day
51:32 it's real late at night and then we're
51:34 we always do kind of a little jam
51:36 session afterwards
51:37 at the time and my employees were like
51:40 god did you see how he ate that orange
51:44 i was like what do you mean oh my god
51:47 he just devoured that orange it was so
51:48 huge and he just ate that thing in like
51:50 60 seconds and i was like oh i didn't
51:53 have the ability to pay attention to
51:55 that but that orange moment
51:57 was like an inside joke it was just it
52:01 was an
52:01 impressive thing that he did not
52:03 anything else and but they kept talking
52:04 about the orange man for
52:06 weeks after that right so there's a
52:08 little entertaining anecdote
52:10 that you might drop if you have
52:12 something that's related to the
52:14 situation you're not trying to get
52:15 credit for
52:16 being with the person who's really
52:18 accomplished in this world
52:20 now the one that i have found that's
52:21 really
52:23 weird because i'm going to give you two
52:24 stories
52:27 i'll give you a story at bel air country
52:28 club i think i've said this once before
52:31 but
52:32 we were being introduced my buddy and i
52:34 richard taylor knight we had this
52:35 led 3d theater thing all worked out
52:38 ready to go
52:39 now we just needed investors so we're
52:42 introduced to a few folks
52:44 and we end up going to bel air a lot so
52:47 we're getting
52:48 introduced this guy whose name happened
52:49 to be frank as well different type of
52:51 friend
52:52 and frank was just kind of a he's an
52:55 interesting guy
52:56 he he really knew his stuff really
52:58 really well but when you meet someone
53:00 you know as an investor you always got
53:01 to treat him like a snake oil salesman
53:03 or a
53:04 shyster just to make sure you uh
53:08 you make him fight for it and
53:11 everybody knew richard's background
53:13 because he was a famous director
53:14 he was on tron
53:18 but now this nobody knows really who i
53:20 am and no one seems to be asking
53:22 why am i there which i just thought was
53:26 kind of strange so usually we do little
53:29 you know roundabouts to say what's your
53:32 background why are you here what are you
53:33 responsible for in the company
53:36 at the time i was the ceo and my buddy
53:40 was
53:41 not really wanting to take the cto
53:42 because he wasn't i was that too
53:44 so he was more like the visionary and it
53:46 was great
53:48 but i remember so we sat down for lunch
53:51 and there was like a
53:52 big pause and so i said uh
53:55 somehow i was introducing myself to
53:57 frank across the table
54:00 and i wanted to just tell him how i
54:02 built zero g games and made
54:04 you know made quite a bit of money in
54:06 that and so i just
54:09 sort of said hey you know my name is
54:10 mark blah blah blah shake his hand
54:14 i said you know my background is this
54:16 and i built this company and we had this
54:18 revenue stream blah blah blah and this
54:20 guy actually looks across the table and
54:22 goes
54:23 something like uh i'm i'm sure you're
54:26 really important
54:29 just like that kind of being an [ __ ]
54:30 you know
54:32 with frank you were you would be like
54:34 the star of the
54:36 of the week and then the next week you'd
54:38 be
54:39 nobody you'd lick his feet you know i
54:41 mean like it was just
54:42 weird how he would behave i think he had
54:44 some serious
54:45 you know behavioral issues so sometimes
54:50 you try to establish yourself and you
54:52 get those really crappy
54:53 responses back but now there's an
54:57 indirect one
54:58 that you might run into in your lifetime
55:01 and if you guys have other scenarios
55:02 please document them in the comments
55:05 or if you've had the same scenario and
55:07 it's important to you think we might
55:08 learn something
55:09 most definitely take some time out and
55:11 put it down below
55:13 there was a point in my life in my 20s
55:15 and 30s
55:17 where i had managed to gain the trust
55:20 of very very serious people
55:24 people that do not just create they
55:26 basically
55:27 they don't need any friends and so when
55:30 they take you in their circle
55:32 and they recommend you to their people
55:36 it's a big deal in your brain because
55:39 you know you gain
55:39 credibility with individuals you know
55:42 and
55:42 my one name drop in this area is steve
55:45 jobs
55:47 so i had won this guy over on my
55:49 personal
55:51 communications with him that led to
55:55 you know my personal communications with
55:57 him had gained enough credibility that
55:58 it ended up
55:59 where i was negotiating a deal between
56:01 ea.com and apple for two years
56:04 so it was interesting how that
56:05 manifested into something very real
56:08 plus a bunch of other stuff he tried to
56:10 hire me twice and i was a [ __ ]
56:12 and was trying to protect my 50 people
56:14 at ea because my boss
56:16 was threatening to lay them all off
56:17 which he eventually did
56:19 but he got fired in the first round
56:22 they got laid off he got fired it was
56:24 nice
56:26 the other one is that there are various
56:28 folks in hollywood that are very tough
56:30 to get to
56:31 they don't want any friends and i gained
56:33 their trust
56:34 and became extremely good friends to the
56:36 point where one of them said to me he
56:38 goes i only have two friends and one of
56:39 them is dead
56:40 and you're the other one so it's huge so
56:44 you get entrusted
56:45 and then you realize that what you're
56:46 discussing is are are
56:48 things that are phenomenally deep and
56:51 complicated and result in either big
56:54 blockbuster films being created or
56:56 big giant you know tech deals being made
56:58 in the background
57:01 so then it's obvious usually
57:04 to you as the individual that as you
57:08 gain other opportunities of the same
57:10 kind and you're trying to establish
57:12 your professionalism if someone's
57:16 willing to read your resume
57:17 they may gain all that really quickly
57:20 and
57:20 you're off to the races i've been in
57:22 think tanks where it's like
57:24 when i get introduced the guy running
57:26 the think tank introduces me and there's
57:28 barely anything for me to say after that
57:30 just hi how you doing but there will be
57:33 people like that guy at bel air who
57:35 would never read a resume
57:37 didn't really you know it was like we're
57:39 all seventy
57:40 three seventy year olds in the company
57:42 at the time like one was 71 he was 70.
57:45 and uh he just didn't like
57:49 that was weird you know he would say
57:50 weird things like he had just married a
57:51 woman that was
57:52 39 years old he was 70. and he would
57:55 make jokes at dinner going well you know
57:57 i want mark to take over after i die
58:00 and the whole you know i'm sitting there
58:01 going like he hasn't talked to me he
58:03 said i'm going to say this joke he just
58:05 says that you know we're all laughing
58:06 our asses off so i couldn't figure out
58:08 was this guy like me or not like me man
58:11 turns out you know they don't think he
58:14 likes anybody including himself
58:16 unfortunately because he he did earn
58:17 that
58:18 ability but i've had to at times and
58:21 it's been
58:22 successful sometimes and been totally
58:23 unsuccessful other times
58:26 to mention some of these folks i've
58:28 worked with to say yeah
58:29 you know i gain this trust from this
58:31 person sometimes if they know that
58:33 person really well it clicks and then
58:35 you get
58:35 automatically validated up to that level
58:38 and then you can pull back from ever
58:39 having to say another thing about
58:40 yourself
58:41 and you just get back to business
58:43 because it's not about
58:44 the old stories and the old stuff i mean
58:48 there were there were moments in my
58:51 startup
58:52 with the uh led theater project
58:56 where i have a partner or some you know
58:59 someone involved in the company you know
59:01 they were kind of walking back from
59:02 lunch and then they go
59:04 well how well did you know steve you
59:06 know they really wanted to know how many
59:07 times were in the same room with the guy
59:09 what did you do
59:10 they were they were interested but
59:12 somehow on a public forum they didn't
59:14 want to
59:14 expose that part of my life just in case
59:18 maybe it was what amazing i don't
59:20 understand it
59:21 they're willing to have all those
59:22 conversations on the side
59:24 very strange but here is where i think
59:28 the rubber meets the pavement with this
59:29 particular episode
59:31 especially in a professional capacity
59:35 if you have figured out what you love to
59:37 do and you want that to be your career
59:41 and you've done it before especially if
59:43 you haven't done it before it could even
59:45 be more frustrating
59:46 you know you've gained all the
59:47 credibility from those who do what you'd
59:49 love to do and all you're trying to do
59:51 is get an invitation into the club
59:53 that's the hollywood problem man you can
59:56 hover around hollywood it's like all the
59:58 sperm trying to get into an egg man
60:00 it's crazy you're just sitting there
60:01 banging on this egg trying to find a
60:03 little opening
60:04 and i swear to god when you find it it's
60:06 eureka
60:07 and things start to roll it's just crazy
60:09 you become another life form you know
60:12 the thing that no one ever tells you
60:15 your mother your father your uncle
60:17 never tells you is that you have to
60:21 maintain a certain velocity
60:25 as you are dropping your mad
60:29 science and your credibility on
60:31 individuals
60:33 because what can happen is you'll be in
60:35 some session
60:37 i see this all the time i met a girl
60:38 who's in her early 30s
60:40 the other day and my god she was just a
60:44 train wreck of dropping names and trying
60:47 to get stuff
60:48 and then the more you let her talk about
60:50 just incidental things you start to
60:52 realize
60:52 oh this person has a serious
60:55 self-perception problem
60:56 meaning she's so insecure she keeps
60:59 talking
61:01 waiting for some but for me to do
61:03 something to give her validation
61:04 so that she feels comfortable and can
61:07 stop
61:08 saying these things right and then i
61:10 watched your social media for a while
61:12 and it was really bizarre
61:13 some of the comments um it's really
61:17 inappropriate stuff it's kind of haunted
61:18 forever
61:20 so it you know my my
61:23 opinion on how to you know distribute
61:26 your
61:26 qualifications to get credit
61:30 for what you're capable of doing would
61:32 be like this
61:34 if you do it in paper form or website
61:36 form you know your resume is online
61:39 maybe it's your linkedin maybe it's your
61:41 own.com
61:43 that's probably the best way to do it
61:45 because then the person
61:48 viewing your capabilities can ingest
61:52 at their own will at their own rate it
61:54 could be two o'clock in the morning
61:55 they're naked in a
61:56 in a robe they're getting to do it
62:00 however they want to do it that's the
62:02 least impactful
62:04 or yeah you know disruptively i should
62:06 say
62:07 that you can get the information to them
62:09 a lot of them will want the paper resume
62:12 now depending on your type of career
62:14 like my career has been all over the map
62:16 i've done like five
62:18 distinctly different careers in my
62:20 lifetime at least
62:22 and so at that point maybe for the
62:24 particular venture you're in
62:27 you create a resume that only links to
62:30 all the things that are relative
62:33 to what you're doing with just minor
62:36 mentions
62:36 of being in the other companies and then
62:38 when you give it to them
62:40 or email it to them you explain this
62:42 isn't my full resume
62:44 this is the part of my resume that
62:45 matters you're getting credit
62:48 you're getting validated and this will
62:50 determine your salary this will
62:52 determine your position
62:53 whether or not sometimes you're even
62:55 kept in the venture whatsoever
62:58 but now there are anomalies right
63:02 there are anomalies where you'll have a
63:04 person
63:06 like my business partner which i can i
63:08 can't say i ever figured this guy out to
63:10 be honest i worked with him for
63:11 a year and i just never could figure
63:14 this guy out
63:16 sometimes they my my business partner
63:20 frank
63:20 he would exhibition me in front of other
63:23 people
63:25 it was crazy we'd have a huge group of
63:27 like the academy of arts uh
63:29 in film and they're looking at the
63:30 technology and he'd be like this is mark
63:34 and just lay out my whole thing and just
63:36 you know it was like it was my dad
63:38 bragging about his son
63:39 sort of thing and then a week later it
63:41 was like
63:42 i wasn't fit to take out the trash and
63:44 then a week after that i was
63:46 you know tesla again in his brain it was
63:48 just the most bizarre
63:49 sort of bipolar adhd attention span
63:53 deficit
63:54 issue it's really strange so
63:58 you know having two parents it's okay so
64:00 the one thing that's defective in my
64:01 gene pool
64:02 i've noticed it's a defective gene i
64:04 don't know
64:06 how this happens maybe it's probably
64:08 social not
64:09 not genetic but i had two parents that
64:12 were
64:13 in competition with me the more i
64:15 succeeded
64:16 one of them would silently passively
64:18 aggressively destroy
64:19 all my stuff like destroy the history of
64:22 my capability of my
64:23 accomplishments physically destroy
64:25 drawings and stuff
64:27 just weird and then one the other one is
64:30 very
64:30 um very in your face
64:35 you're wrong you're wrong you're wrong
64:36 because i read in an article that you're
64:39 wrong
64:40 has no science background or no no
64:43 background in anything that you're
64:44 talking about
64:45 so they don't have any experience
64:46 they're talking out their ass but in
64:48 this person's brain
64:50 they have to be the winner constantly
64:53 which shows extreme immaturity doesn't
64:56 matter how old your body is
64:58 it's just a joke so when i
65:01 had parents like that what was very
65:03 interesting was
65:05 i never it was the anti-force
65:09 of uh trying to take a drawing to mommy
65:13 and daddy because
65:15 one of them would go that sucks doesn't
65:17 look like anything you know i mean
65:18 that's the kind of person one of them
65:20 was
65:20 and the other one would just go yeah
65:22 that's great
65:24 it's really good and then later my
65:27 they take my drawing out and burn it you
65:29 know i mean it was just some weird thing
65:31 i'm not sure what causes that bizarre
65:34 thing
65:34 it's as if they can conceive of being
65:38 more impressive themselves and so they
65:43 they hate the fact you're successful
65:47 it's a weird thing so depending on what
65:50 realm you're in you could have
65:53 business associates that are like my
65:55 parents
65:57 and i will say that there are situations
65:59 where if you can't win the person over
66:03 and this person is either your peer or
66:05 your superior
66:08 you don't have a you don't have a fit
66:10 man
66:11 it's never going to be good ever
66:14 they're going to mess with you until
66:16 they kick you out
66:18 or cause a problem they may
66:21 in some cases i i haven't really ever
66:23 seen what i'm about to say
66:24 actually take place i have heard rumors
66:27 of this sort of thing where someone will
66:28 mess something up
66:29 and then they've already deviously
66:31 planned how to blame it on you
66:35 there's the whole thing of uh this is
66:37 kind of remotely related but a lot of
66:39 you know about the scam that companies
66:41 pull on you and it's it's it's a hideous
66:44 thing they do
66:46 they will give you a uh a promotion with
66:48 a raise
66:50 and what they're trying to do is promote
66:52 you into your uh
66:54 inabilities so they can fire you
66:57 like ah could that person ever handle
66:59 that job no okay promote him into that
67:00 job
67:01 and just start taking notes about how
67:03 they're screwing everything up
67:05 if you're clever and they've completely
67:08 miscalculated you
67:10 they'll just keep promoting you and
67:11 promoting you until
67:14 they coo you out of the company could be
67:17 the entire time they're promoting you
67:18 you're actually kicking ass and taking
67:20 names that's not what they're looking
67:22 for they're looking to get rid of you
67:23 they're looking to take your salary and
67:25 add it to theirs at the end of the year
67:27 with the big fat bonus
67:29 so be aware you have to pace yourself
67:34 let them find out what your what you've
67:36 done in the past
67:37 i will tell you this the most incredible
67:41 geniuses that i've ever either known
67:44 personally or known
67:45 about virtually never
67:48 ever attempted to get a credit one point
67:52 in time
67:53 the fact like ron sterling the guy that
67:55 invented and wrote most of the twilight
67:57 zones
67:58 i'm personally unaware of that guy ever
68:01 being in an interview and
68:02 tooting his own horn you know people
68:05 would say things to him
68:06 they'd say well you know they'd
68:08 introduce them on a show right certainly
68:10 pop up
68:10 a bun he just kind of smile and go yeah
68:12 that was me yeah
68:13 anyway i don't think i've ever heard
68:16 steve jobs say a single word
68:18 about how amazing he was stanley kubrick
68:22 i don't remember him ever seeing
68:23 anything
68:24 remotely associated with how amazing he
68:26 was
68:29 and surely these individuals understand
68:31 how amazing they are
68:33 especially when they do something
68:34 amazing but i think that like prince who
68:40 you know he did have his moments where
68:42 he got frustrated where people were
68:44 you know shania o'connor was given
68:46 access to his song nothing comparish to
68:48 you
68:49 which he wrote for the family which is
68:51 an album that you should
68:52 own if you like that kind of music
68:55 but it was only in when his music was
68:57 getting given to other people
68:59 and they were getting famous and no one
69:00 was mentioning prince he was like hey
69:02 dude i
69:03 just by the way i wrote that song it's
69:04 now number one around the world
69:07 so tesla
69:10 tesla didn't have a need for credit
69:13 until people started giving credit away
69:15 for the radio
69:17 he's like well that guy's using like you
69:18 know 50 some of my patents or some
69:21 maybe 100 something patents of mine to
69:23 create that invention
69:24 so just be aware that without me
69:27 actually inventing all that technology
69:29 that guy wouldn't have any
69:30 accomplishments in your eyes
69:32 i think it is extremely valuable
69:35 to know about the greats of the world
69:39 and how they dealt with these issues so
69:41 that you will personally
69:44 sort of have a reference model it's
69:46 almost a lookup table for you
69:48 what situation are you in what goal
69:51 you're trying to accomplish
69:53 who was in a very similar situation you
69:56 look at their bios you look at how they
69:58 did or didn't take any credit as far as
70:00 i can tell
70:01 the greats rarely ever took credit and
70:04 they were still
70:05 able to remain the top of their game
70:09 now typically there's a self-employment
70:12 aspect to that quality when you're
70:15 self-employed
70:16 you get to be as amazing as you want to
70:19 be and it doesn't matter if anyone
70:21 gives you a chotsky or anything like
70:23 that
70:24 when you work for a company then you
70:26 have to keep everyone informed as to
70:28 what you're doing at a pace that again
70:31 doesn't exceed your modesty
70:35 meaning like oh you seen as you know you
70:37 don't want to have this conversation
70:38 behind your back where you're someone in
70:40 your company is going
70:41 uh you know joe over there yeah you know
70:44 how many times he tells me
70:45 how amazing he is you know your
70:48 accomplishments if you give a report to
70:51 your
70:51 higher-ups it shouldn't have any
70:54 adjectives about
70:56 your amazingness let them write those
70:59 adjectives about you
71:00 but let's say that you took some source
71:02 code and somehow you rewrote it over the
71:04 weekend or
71:05 guided your employees with some epiphany
71:07 that you had
71:10 and it made the code four times faster
71:13 and so
71:15 you you're definitely going to write in
71:17 your in your status report
71:19 well i was able to get the code to run
71:21 you know four times as fast
71:23 and so really proud of the team
71:26 believe me adjectives are going to come
71:28 your way when it comes to
71:30 your annual review to someone having a
71:32 conversation about you they're going to
71:34 be like yeah
71:34 dude that woman really just
71:37 knows how to kill it they're they're a
71:40 staple
71:41 they're a column in this infrastructure
71:44 of our company
71:46 there's any layoffs they're one of the
71:47 last people you get rid of
71:49 but as a manager let me just close with
71:52 this little tidbit
71:55 you need to make sure that if you're the
71:56 one actually doing a lot of the work
71:59 in addition to your employees which i i
72:01 recommend always being a manager with
72:03 your hands on
72:04 because once you become a hands-off
72:05 manager one you
72:07 personally lose connection with the
72:09 actual problems and when you get into
72:11 conversations with
72:12 other managers or maybe you're pulled in
72:14 for a weekly meeting or something
72:17 and someone says well why haven't you
72:18 fixed this problem and if you go
72:21 i don't know let me go ask my coders how
72:23 this works uh
72:24 you're starting to get on the chopping
72:25 block which is why you want to stay
72:27 involved
72:28 to the point you're like well we have
72:29 this you know binary uh
72:32 i don't know ascii conversion thing
72:35 that's
72:36 the the code module we got had no
72:38 documentation so we're still trying to
72:40 figure it out because we're cutting edge
72:42 whatever blah blah blah some something
72:44 in something that shows that you
72:46 understand what's going on
72:48 i'm bringing you these episodes because
72:51 this is stuff nobody no one ever talks
72:55 about
72:56 and this is key to your survival
73:00 and if you are young enough that you i
73:03 know you're going to run into these
73:04 issues
73:04 but you haven't yet run into these
73:06 issues you will know that these are gold
73:08 bars you're getting out of these
73:10 episodes
73:11 that you're going to have a plan
73:14 where no one else has a plan you're
73:17 going to have
73:18 a fundamental understanding of
73:21 credit because i gave you those examples
73:23 of the little kid
73:24 walking up and saying hey mommy daddy
73:26 see what i did you're going to
73:28 understand this is a fundamental
73:30 instinct of mankind that is only being
73:33 perpetrated
73:34 at older and older age brackets and more
73:37 and more complex situations
73:41 i think my advice in the end would be
73:43 let other people write your
73:46 amazing epitaph of each project that you
73:48 do
73:49 don't try to write it yourself anyway
73:52 hopefully that was helpful to you
73:54 and on that note if you haven't been to
73:55 deepthoughtsradio.com please go
73:58 especially during these interesting
74:00 times
74:01 definitely bookmark the web page
74:02 somewhere in your web browser
74:04 and i would also recommend using brave
74:07 browser with duckduckgo search engine so
74:09 you can get the actual results that
74:11 you're looking for
74:12 i recently converted a friend because
74:14 he's watching me on my computer because
74:16 i'm showing him pictures and stuff and
74:17 he's like what is this browser you're
74:19 using and what does duckduckgo and i was
74:20 i told him so then two days later he's
74:23 on his phone he's like dude the research
74:25 results are
74:26 totally different than google i said
74:28 yeah and
74:29 duckduckgo does not track any of your
74:31 behavior and neither does brave
74:33 so it's awesome even though it's based
74:35 on the chrome engine
74:37 adreno chrome engine they're not
74:40 tracking anything that you're doing so
74:41 you're being spied on just like anything
74:44 with the the routers of the world that
74:46 steal all of our traffic and that kind
74:48 of thing but at least this private
74:49 company isn't going to gather up your
74:50 stuff and sell it to
74:51 cambridge analytics so that's good but
74:54 on the website we have all the video
74:56 all the audio all the social media we
74:58 have an all new remastered season one on
74:59 its own channel
75:02 we have a store with two shirts left two
75:05 brand new ones for season six
75:07 with the all-new um deep thoughts radio
75:10 university that shirt's going to stay up
75:12 there forever
75:13 and we also have a couple ways to donate
75:15 to the channel
75:17 i will definitely say i never thought
75:19 that that would ever
75:20 make a difference in any big way on my
75:23 end but it actually does
75:24 it actually does when at the end of the
75:26 month i can transfer 100 bucks here
75:27 there
75:28 so for any of you partying with cash i
75:31 super appreciate it
75:33 hopefully i'm tickling your fancy as
75:35 they say
75:37 but anyway take care of yourself and
75:38 someone else and i'll see you in the
75:40 next deep thoughts
75:41 over now
75:53 [Music]
76:08 [Applause]
76:13 [Music]
76:19 you
