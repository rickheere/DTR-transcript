00:00 [Music]
00:33 geez welcome back to deep thoughts I
00:38 just been an hour and a half
00:42 fighting apples excuse for a company
00:46 trying to get my final cut to import
00:49 these films I can put about three on a
00:51 memory stick before I have to drag them
00:52 off onto the hard drive but Apple swear
00:59 to god it's a carcass of what it used to
01:02 be but that's not we're gonna talk about
01:06 we're gonna talk about a hybrid theory
01:13 that I've been towing with that I am
01:15 going to call God epochs about God
01:22 because this is exactly we're talking
01:24 about an epoch because I need a
01:25 measurement of time that might coincide
01:29 with some of the history that we've seen
01:32 this is sort of a wishful thinking
01:37 what's the theory this is my theory it's
01:42 a lot about the brontosaurus our once
01:45 was taught a very interesting thing
01:46 about the stock market and I don't even
01:48 know if this is true but that the
01:52 investors of the world yes the scumbags
01:55 that run the world
01:56 but even this makes sense for folks that
01:59 aren't scumbags that they rotate money
02:04 out of a hose into sort of a pie-chart
02:08 potential things to invest in what does
02:13 that mean
02:13 imagine you had a pie and you had
02:17 various industries tack yeah you know
02:19 heavy industry like mining and building
02:22 and are actually probably just minerals
02:25 and then you did have construction and
02:27 whatever food just make a whole
02:30 kaleidoscope of everything that you
02:32 could possibly invest in on a
02:33 sector-by-sector basis right so we have
02:37 all these pies kind of like Trivial
02:38 Pursuit and like the hour-hand
02:44 on your clock the hoses money goes in a
02:48 circle and it's pretty wide spray right
02:51 so you could be spraying two industries
02:53 at the same time you're you're ramping
02:55 up funding on one and you're pulling out
02:58 funding on another and then it goes in a
02:59 circle and at first I was like well why
03:03 didn't I would anyone do that you know
03:05 and they said well because you'll never
03:08 know if a business is successful if she
03:10 continually dumped money into it to keep
03:11 it going
03:12 the sales staff will never have any
03:14 motivation to sell because their
03:18 salaries always get paid there's no
03:20 threat we won't know if your products
03:22 good because no one will have to charge
03:25 a competitive price for it so you would
03:30 you know I don't know you could just do
03:32 all kinds of crazy stuff if someone
03:33 continually pays the bill you know what
03:35 I mean
03:35 all right so I haven't been able to
03:38 shake that idea when it comes to our
03:40 world
03:43 when you look at our world it could be a
03:46 couple different eventualities for those
03:50 of you who believe in God's incredible
03:54 participation levels in our world you
03:57 believe in Jesus Christ and all the
03:58 stuff I think this is really aimed at
04:03 your group for those that simply believe
04:06 in a creator without any man-made
04:09 religion it's probably less for you
04:13 for those of you who are atheists this
04:16 probably doesn't have a lot of value
04:18 except to listen to the theory and
04:20 perhaps put it in your quiver of ways it
04:24 probably is not you know and I'll give
04:26 you an example if someone starts talking
04:29 about determinism within religion the
04:33 notion that God has everything written
04:34 down in a book you know a lot of us come
04:38 to grips with the fact that that means
04:40 that there's no [ __ ] reason why
04:43 should we should exist you know if God
04:45 can write it all down and calculate
04:47 every possible hand a poker that could
04:49 ever exist based on every single mental
04:52 and physical variable then he need not
04:55 create a casino a house or a player what
05:00 would be the point to see it happen but
05:02 now I want to see it happen well why you
05:05 already know the outcome of every single
05:06 game see it's just I wouldn't want to
05:10 [ __ ] waste my time with that if I was
05:12 him what the hell was my little Theory
05:15 mean well my theory is based on the
05:17 theory of economics which is to simply
05:19 say maybe God shows up every epoch I'm
05:26 just picking that because epochs as I
05:30 have researched then you will hear
05:32 people talk immediately just say there
05:34 are 2500 years boom then I hear people
05:38 say we have no actual idea how long an
05:41 epoch is give me 2700 years could be 26
05:46 50 yeah all I'm talking about is sort of
05:50 a point of reference where someone might
05:52 say Oh God we're light-years away from
05:54 that right what if
05:57 shows up and really participates in the
06:01 function of the world it's not you know
06:06 like he's sitting in your bathroom when
06:08 you get there in the morning yeah but
06:11 what if he did you know hold rallies but
06:15 if he did walk around his hands come out
06:19 of the sky that freaked the [ __ ] out of
06:22 me I'll tell you that much
06:23 well let's just say on some level he's
06:26 participating an interval perhaps it's a
06:29 very short interval perhaps he never
06:31 really shows up physically but he
06:34 participates in our minds a bit like the
06:37 monolith from 2001 a Space Odyssey and
06:40 abused us with understanding basically
06:43 slips acid into over drinks I bet God
06:47 could make some really good acid but
06:50 then he says okay I can run my own show
06:55 and yes I could play army with all of
06:58 you humans down below but I really
07:02 respect the fact that life has to have
07:07 its own journey I've given you
07:10 intelligence as I understand it myself
07:13 right people forget this old saying you
07:16 know it takes one to know one
07:18 so you know it's really sort of a
07:23 paradoxical thought for those of us that
07:26 are sort of in-between organized
07:28 religion and atheists atheism we have
07:31 just God in the center and we're not
07:33 sure how he works we're trying to figure
07:35 it out right we're pretty certain how
07:37 some parts of the way he does this thing
07:39 works and then we just totally confused
07:42 right but what could you do but create
07:44 something in your own image right how
07:48 would you really I mean you could create
07:51 lesser creatures in not in your image
07:55 but if you want to go straight up to the
07:57 absolute pin to ultimate of what you
07:59 could do I think it'd be tough to
08:01 conceive of something that's far greater
08:02 than yourself not that it can't be done
08:05 but I think it'd be tough
08:07 you know you look at sea animals oh my
08:12 god the amount of diversity in Siena
08:15 Moses
08:16 I think someone told me once it's
08:19 something like you know ten to one
08:22 overlaying creatures because land is so
08:25 brutal you can't hide in three
08:27 dimensions in land right so you can't
08:30 have an animal floating at a thousand
08:34 feet that doesn't have wings but even
08:37 birds get tired after land all right but
08:40 you can't just have creatures living in
08:43 three dimensions in our in our above
08:46 soil world there's no ecosystem I mean
08:50 there's no food up and you know ten
08:52 thousand feet right so the reason I
08:55 mentioned that is that God and and us
09:00 must have something seriously in common
09:04 you know
09:05 we are frail when we are born yet we
09:08 dominate this planet doesn't that make
09:12 you think a little bit different about
09:15 your existence I mean [ __ ] a horse is
09:19 born and within 30 seconds it's walking
09:23 right I think the majority of creatures
09:27 can completely exist on their own as
09:29 soon as they're born think about little
09:32 tiny Turtles think about fish their
09:34 parents aren't sitting around coddling
09:36 them like bears do their Cubs sure a
09:40 domesticated conversion of a wild animal
09:42 such as a cat or a dog they definitely
09:45 have to take care of the litter their
09:46 borings you know furless and blind and
09:50 yeah we are to me oh you know we're
09:52 really fragile it's a wonder we made it
09:56 it sort of beckons to the notion that
09:59 there's some sort of divine programming
10:03 that keeps us from dying off and I know
10:06 that Darwinism folks will say oh that's
10:10 just survival of the fittest
10:11 okay keep going back keep going back
10:14 keep going back at some point you might
10:18 have some barbaric hairy
10:21 if that's where you think we came from
10:24 but think about the village of these
10:27 animals whatever our primate if you
10:33 believe in that horseshit beginnings
10:35 where they'd have to have some form of
10:37 protection some form of like camaraderie
10:40 to get together we're gonna protect
10:42 other people's Young's not just our own
10:44 now again where things are peaceful like
10:47 penguins they don't have a bunch of you
10:50 know natural predators where they go to
10:54 lay their eggs right so you don't have
10:56 polar bears and penguins living in the
10:59 same place boy those polar bears if
11:03 they'd ever moved down there did the
11:05 South Pole holy [ __ ] they would just
11:07 gorge they personally be responsible for
11:11 the extinction of the penguin what if
11:14 they could live down there but so the
11:17 idea is that there's an interesting sort
11:20 of awakening going on in 2018 not
11:23 whether or not a persist or not we're
11:24 all hoping we're praying for the best
11:27 people don't fall back asleep again but
11:31 somehow they can't use technology to
11:34 steal our consciousness or kill us off
11:37 right sure is a [ __ ] ton of shows on TV
11:42 where everyone's getting whacked
11:43 there's predictive programming there
11:45 when worries about it's like okay we
11:47 just finished like a 10 year run of
11:49 [ __ ] zombie shows movies we still
11:52 have you know Walking Dead meandering
11:57 around AMC but Westworld we just have a
12:04 bunch we have a bunch of shows there was
12:07 a black mirror season finale of season 3
12:11 where everyone dies not everyone but a
12:15 bunch of folks season 4 you had a
12:21 post-apocalyptic world it makes you
12:26 wonder you know if we woke up enough to
12:28 take a mount what happens but it almost
12:32 seems like too
12:33 there's a little precedence for the
12:36 notion of the good guys being in the
12:41 right place at the right time over and
12:43 over and over again we'll have to finish
12:46 this year to figure it out you talk
12:48 about the people that walk around say
12:50 the end of the world is coming on this
12:52 show every once in a while I think for
12:55 those folks they are elated at the
12:58 notion of the end of the world and it's
13:01 really simple it's super duper simple
13:03 one they're ignorant enough to think
13:05 that they are completely saved in the
13:08 eyes of God that they are sinless they
13:10 have followed all the [ __ ] rules that
13:12 pedophiles wrote down for us back in the
13:14 day so they've done all that they stand
13:19 around usually accusing a bunch of
13:21 people being sinners and going to hell
13:22 which sort of counter balances their
13:25 salvation but think about it you have
13:30 $60,000 in credit card debt and you
13:32 think the world's about to end because
13:34 you you finally picked up the Bible and
13:36 you read revelations and you're probably
13:40 coked out of your brain anyway so there
13:43 you go it's gonna end your bills will
13:48 never be due because God's gonna pay off
13:51 your loan that backache that extra
13:55 hundred pounds you're carrying on your
13:56 body yeah won't even matter let's go get
13:59 another piece of cake hell yeah
14:00 the world's about to end really nice day
14:05 if it did Tuesdays I could never get the
14:09 hang of Tuesday's Arthur Dent says but
14:13 what if God was coming back and perhaps
14:16 not in a visual way again or maybe he
14:20 would but he'd be a homeless guy walking
14:21 down the street walk around T and ask
14:25 you for a sandwich just like that song
14:27 Prince wrote what if God was one of us
14:30 and you got that choice and you look at
14:32 him you're like I got money not for you
14:37 I don't think God plays games like that
14:40 it seems strange right the more of a
14:43 devout Christian that you are I would
14:46 have to assume having left that religion
14:49 a long time ago but still respecting its
14:51 its teachings I don't know how my
14:56 Christian friends exist in this world
14:59 right why aren't there I'm just asking I
15:05 mean you know geez for my devout
15:07 Christian friends how do you know about
15:09 Tony Podesta Hillary Clinton Obama Bill
15:13 Clinton and Jeffrey Epstein and all
15:15 these CEOs and all these creeps that are
15:20 involved in in all this horrible stuff
15:22 like you can just be war in your head
15:25 you could just be sexual orientation and
15:28 a bunch of other things that might have
15:30 a religious connotation to it or some
15:32 other counter directive but when it
15:34 comes to touching kids where's God all
15:40 right this gets to Stephen Fry's old
15:42 theory where's God if they truly do
15:48 sacrifice kids in some Eyes Wide Shut
15:49 party where's God I heard a funny
15:54 trailer to some show the other day or
15:56 something or it said the greatest trick
15:58 on man is making man think that God was
16:01 ever real and the show says something
16:04 like the only one that does exist is the
16:07 devil it's like whoa that's [ __ ]
16:11 heavy right we're gonna F on this one
16:13 good no no why I put the word God in
16:16 there now I'm saying the f-bomb but
16:19 imagine you really do believe
16:22 fanatically religion Christian religion
16:25 let's just say because again I'm in
16:26 America I don't have a lot of access to
16:28 other religions Jewish people right here
16:31 pretty few and far between but as I deal
16:33 with them they're pretty casual they
16:36 don't get in that hell damnation thing
16:38 or guilt so you know I guess there is
16:44 potentially like this little envelope
16:46 around yourself where you feel like you
16:48 have salvation
16:50 as a bubble okay so you're protected
16:53 right but now you start seeing crazy
16:57 spread like a virus across the continent
17:00 that you live on i don't care where the
17:03 hell you live you see modern culture
17:05 come in you see hollywood come in you
17:07 see TV shows come in trying to confuse
17:12 your kids on every single conceivable
17:13 level of everything as to what is who
17:16 they are is of being whether or not
17:17 their wiener means they're a boy or not
17:20 whether college is good you know I was
17:25 just baited into watching Silicon Valley
17:27 the show and I watched season our
17:30 episode one excuse me it's a little slow
17:32 for my brain but one of the things
17:34 that's in theirs is a kind of a joke
17:36 about a guy talking about a TED talk
17:38 telling you how how and why you should
17:40 not go to college and it's a comedy and
17:43 I guess the social justice warriors are
17:45 looking at this show you know they can
17:49 they're watching you know Citizen Kane
17:52 or something but the dude is right I
17:54 mean everything that whoever wrote that
17:55 they're completely right about the
17:57 serfdom that comes with college and the
18:00 false promise of anything to educate
18:06 yourself right but everyone's being
18:09 infiltrated by this tiny minority this
18:11 it's truly like a teeny tiny drop of
18:14 blood that's been injected in you with
18:16 the virus and unlike a virus that gets
18:19 to grow by itself you get to see you get
18:21 to put the energy into the virus to see
18:23 if it's gonna grow inside you you get to
18:26 feed it it's bringing out put it in the
18:28 light let it photosynthesize whatever it
18:31 needs to grow you really have the choice
18:34 turn off the TV stop watching those
18:36 films boycott actors that tend to always
18:39 find themselves in one of those agendas
18:43 whatever you got to do right
18:46 so seems like God is really giving us a
18:49 tremendous amount of freedom like pretty
18:53 much infinite freedom if any of this
18:57 Lolita Island thing with Epstein and the
19:00 Clinton family potentially the Podesta's
19:04 if they
19:09 if they really did what they did and you
19:11 know he was charged 40 counts of it Bill
19:15 Clinton's got tons of pictures of him
19:17 with weird younger women some of them
19:19 under 18 at times mmm hello by the way
19:27 somebody said that you know Trump is a
19:30 big Epstein fan as well and that's
19:34 complete horseshit the story was is that
19:36 he was invited one time to go to some
19:37 party Trump shows up goes around back
19:40 and finds out that his young daughter
19:43 Epstein's young daughter was holding
19:46 this massive party with a ton of really
19:48 young girls and Trump actually was noted
19:51 as saying I would never let Ivanka do
19:54 this this is wrong these girls are way
19:58 too dolled up and he left but of God did
20:04 come back what would be the sign you
20:08 know your your more kind of lowbrow
20:11 individual who is just cliches sort of
20:14 1920s or 1930s Dust Bowl hillbilly would
20:20 they always come up with this hell and
20:23 damnation thing well fire I will rain
20:25 down from the sky and the dueling banjo
20:28 will just [ __ ] play all day right
20:32 [Music]
20:33 I'm gonna put all my money against such
20:36 a thing and again we're not talking
20:39 about the endgame we're not talking
20:41 about God showing up for the final coup
20:43 de Gras I think I'm talking about the
20:45 notion that this might be a cycle that's
20:48 been going on for a really long time
20:49 right a really long time
20:55 because it seems that the world gets a
20:57 bunch of [ __ ] right and then we get up
20:59 on it's like we can't get anything right
21:02 it's interesting art seems to show up in
21:06 music in sculpture and painting and just
21:12 the way that we understand each other we
21:14 seem to be left brain and right brain at
21:17 the same time like the fully ascended
21:19 Egyptians
21:21 or even the average citizen seemed to be
21:24 brilliant I mean think about this
21:27 the pyramids were built we don't know
21:29 how far back but probably at least 39
21:33 thousand BC which puts it over 40,000
21:37 years ago and then we had these peasants
21:43 living in Europe and during a plague
21:47 living in feral states dying because
21:50 rats carried this disease think about
21:53 every time we move somewhere and settled
21:56 it's not like we're that Star Trek you
21:59 know where we take a Star Trek crew we
22:02 take a shuttle down you have all your
22:03 cool [ __ ] with you right you got a
22:04 tricorder and pop a bob oh I just have
22:06 rations and stuff no but it would seem
22:10 that if we were ever capable of building
22:12 a power generator that is a pyramid it's
22:16 built with the exact same specifications
22:18 in terms of materials and overall
22:21 composition back in the Inca Aztec days
22:24 right their pyramids are the same thing
22:26 it has a super conductive internal rock
22:30 a very resistant non conductive out of
22:35 rock built on giant plateaus you know I
22:38 don't know if the if the South American
22:42 natives which are not Spanish or Mexican
22:44 I don't know if they actually built them
22:47 on aqua ravines or if they were in the
22:50 catacomb of water through their plateaus
22:51 the Egyptians did and they were first
22:54 you know crazy for those of you might
22:58 believe in the flat earth still all
22:59 right dome owners people who are
23:02 conducting the social experiment that is
23:04 our world for those of you think about
23:06 it as a matrix in a computer you know
23:09 I've never said it but I'll say if it is
23:12 a computer simulation the only thing
23:15 that protects us in a computer
23:17 simulation is anything that would make
23:19 us call the creators of the game and
23:21 complain as long as we don't call and
23:23 complain or petition then they don't
23:28 care do what you want
23:30 we built the game you can you can grow
23:32 and you can die and you can resurrect
23:34 you can
23:35 you can die and you can resurrect you
23:36 can make multiple characters different
23:37 classes different races different
23:40 alliances right when I think about this
23:45 notion of God coming back in some cycle
23:48 another thing occurs to me which is is
23:51 there a point where man builds up this
23:55 pressure this hivemind pressure where at
23:59 some point it just pops and we're not
24:02 gonna take this [ __ ] anymore just like
24:03 the movie Network and I'll give you a
24:06 biological reality to this which is the
24:08 flu influenza as I had it taught to me
24:13 back in the day every human being on
24:15 earth carries many flu viruses but there
24:18 are they are inactive non deadly but
24:24 that when a population over populates
24:26 and we become in close more close
24:31 proximity with each other and we have
24:34 maybe nutritional problems with our
24:37 appetites you know we're not we're not
24:40 capable of fighting off infections the
24:45 closer we get the closer that the flu
24:47 viruses of a particular strand see each
24:49 other and when they get too close they
24:52 activate and kill the host you see this
24:56 all the time with the bird flu bird flu
25:01 activates when Birds overpopulate when
25:03 they land in various regions and
25:05 seasonal cycles if they bumped shoulders
25:08 too much with each other it activates it
25:10 kills for approximately two weeks then
25:12 deactivates and the population has been
25:16 reduced as I've told as I've had it told
25:20 to me they do not have the flu does not
25:22 have the ability to fully extinct a
25:25 society well think about that
25:27 [Music]
25:30 something builds and then it pops and
25:34 it's built to reset the balance of
25:38 nature well alright so that's a
25:41 biological thing think about a mental
25:43 thing think about a spiritual thing the
25:46 archetypes of life are everywhere right
25:48 those of you who study the golden mean
25:50 you know it's everywhere
25:51 it's freakin everywhere okay so what if
25:54 there's some sort of builded mean of
25:57 consciousness where we get it to a point
25:59 where as we go down into the spiral the
26:04 pressure builds the acceleration builds
26:08 and at some point we just simply go look
26:10 man you had enough of this
26:13 yeah me too right it's like when Ajax
26:16 was running from the baseball Furies
26:21 there's buddy says I don't think I'm
26:23 gonna make it couldn't run anymore and
26:26 Ajax is good SiC and running from these
26:29 wimps he turns around kicks all their
26:33 asses it's great it would seem that an
26:37 ass-kicking may have just been pulled
26:40 out of the can here in the United States
26:42 of America we can hope that what we read
26:46 is true certainly seems to correlate
26:48 with the news if you read it right
26:49 without a much interpretation either you
26:53 don't need to lie to yourself and change
26:54 the meaning of words to get exactly what
26:57 we're being told is happening behind the
26:59 scenes doesn't guarantee us that the
27:03 replacement crew has any or I should say
27:09 is flawless and will not make the same
27:11 mistakes here and there I tell you what
27:15 I don't know I mean corporatism is the
27:18 thing we're all worried about right your
27:22 watch rollerball in 1975 with James Caan
27:24 that is a pure simulation of what the
27:27 world could be like where corporations
27:29 take over the planet
27:31 but it would seem that the stuff that we
27:35 are seeing in the great awakening of
27:37 2018 is anything but corporatism but
27:40 then again in stage 2 is in here yet
27:42 stage 1 isn't over
27:43 you just never know but sovereignty and
27:46 freedom and individual rights seem to be
27:51 the emphasis and if you maintain that it
27:55 will in the air I should say by design
27:59 it will expose the archetypes of
28:03 corporatism which is that you know
28:07 dangerous shitty products are created
28:11 marketing departments collude to make
28:14 you desire something you do not need and
28:17 then you buy it you very soon usually
28:22 bored to death of it but you've
28:26 surrendered your cash into a banking
28:29 cartel vestment banking cartel corporate
28:33 cartel and into individuals that will
28:35 simply create another Lolita Island
28:37 someplace else and do the stuff they're
28:39 not supposed to do who would have ever
28:42 thought that one of the byproducts of a
28:46 surveillance society has kicked off by
28:48 9/11 designed to spy on us right would
28:55 have caught just a ton of pedophiles but
28:59 sort of backstabbing politicians who
29:02 sellouts so their whole country for
29:06 their own personal gain because that's
29:08 what we're seeing it's unbelievable if I
29:11 made an episode where I just simply
29:13 tried to name all the sellouts and maybe
29:16 one sentence about how they did sellout
29:18 so let's say one person's name and how
29:20 they sold out this should be two hours
29:22 long so people have criminal records
29:25 that are so [ __ ] long it could
29:27 probably read them take me like ten
29:29 hours to even remotely explain what they
29:31 did the former president United States
29:36 ran on a campaign of Hope which is
29:39 basically hey we don't have to define
29:41 anything that we're gonna actually
29:42 accomplish you just sit there and hope
29:44 you [ __ ] wan just hope oh you're on
29:47 food stamps now you lost your job we're
29:50 maintaining seven theatres of war we're
29:52 killing people doing regime change we're
29:56 signing away all the sovereign rights of
29:57 our country to some European [ __ ]
30:01 thing right what's fascinating about it
30:04 is I think that for some folks paying
30:07 attention to especially some of the
30:09 developments and again just get all pop
30:12 in our face
30:13 doesn't look like it now yet I think
30:16 it'll be fascinating even if it were to
30:18 pop even if this were just a simulation
30:20 of some sort within the simulation it's
30:24 making people think I think that's
30:25 awesome and that's why I think it's not
30:27 fake because you don't want to if you're
30:30 if you're a magician for instance and
30:34 you have a lot of sleight of hand and
30:37 it's
30:38 it's 1840 and nobody knows anything
30:41 about sleight of hand up close coin work
30:45 you know the shell games the
30:49 misdirection all had good stuff the last
30:52 thing on [ __ ] earth you would ever
30:54 want to do is teach everyone in the
30:56 world about these things and then try to
30:58 do your show in Vegas it just wouldn't
31:00 work everyone would go well yeah you're
31:03 just okay I see you're trying to make me
31:04 look this way while you're doing that
31:05 yeah you know I see where you hit the
31:08 coin and up your sleeve or behind that
31:10 finger and I never quite see your
31:11 handles look strange because you're
31:12 gripping something on the back side of
31:15 the hand that I can't see why the hell
31:17 would you do that you wouldn't not even
31:20 remotely would you do that okay well
31:24 that's what's happening right now and
31:25 it's being accused as being fake so you
31:29 know to me but the idea of God coming
31:33 getting us on the right track either to
31:37 begin with or again and it'd be
31:41 interesting to parse how that would be
31:43 done that's the interesting thing how
31:44 would that work
31:46 pinkie gift our brains like I said he
31:49 could walk on the earth like I said
31:51 maybe he could publish a full-page ad
31:54 for an infomercial on TV whatever it is
31:57 I think a lot of us would be paralyzed
32:01 with the notion that he exists and have
32:03 it confirmed but then he would leave
32:08 let's just say he gets a star on this on
32:10 the right page he doesn't split hairs
32:12 right isn't coming and say oh you know
32:15 you're at night and you and your wife or
32:18 doing this or you and your husband are
32:19 doing that and you know and anything
32:24 just stop right there but anything you
32:26 could think of as some micro sin that's
32:29 going on maybe maybe he goes through all
32:32 that rigmarole and but I think that it
32:36 would probably be the most blasphemous
32:40 stuff maybe he simply says
32:46 I'm taking a bunch of you with me so
32:50 here's the bus get on so he takes all
32:55 the bad people with him but he does with
32:58 them who knows but he knows that just
33:02 removing these souls from this place
33:06 that we are will allow the rest of us
33:09 that can't conceive of what they did
33:11 because we're good people
33:13 we just sort of naturally balance back
33:15 out again in society right now we have
33:18 an issue and I don't think anyone wants
33:22 to acknowledge it I've mentioned it once
33:25 I don't remember
33:26 my last 20 episodes but we have an
33:30 epidemic of horrific stuff that's been
33:33 going on on planet earth for god knows
33:36 how long
33:37 only God knows how long right we know
33:41 what needs to stop and it looks like it
33:45 might stop it's gonna take a while even
33:49 at the first you know thousand top
33:51 agents that do this are knocked out of
33:54 planet Earth this is talking about
33:56 trafficking human beings molesting
33:59 children selling children any of that
34:01 kind of stuff right sacrifices do to
34:04 religions that need to be eradicated
34:06 from the planet because they're built on
34:09 the destruction of mankind all right so
34:14 say we clear off the crazy super mega
34:18 rich individuals that creates job
34:22 openings right that creates the
34:27 battlefield promotions who's going to
34:29 get those positions now with rich people
34:31 hey you don't have to have a replacement
34:34 for the Home Shopping Network Jeffrey
34:35 Epstein in his pedophile Island you
34:37 don't but someone else will be rich and
34:41 it depends on how they influence their
34:43 brain as to whether or not we recreate
34:46 the monsters that we just labored to get
34:48 rid of how do you like the war on drugs
34:50 folks all right those who say they're
34:54 fighting the war on drugs are actually
34:56 the operating agents of
34:59 the drug importation and selling so it's
35:04 a self protecting thing right we've
35:08 never been able to put a dent in drug
35:10 sales anywhere in the planet we just
35:12 have it because that's how three-letter
35:16 alphabet agencies fund themselves right
35:19 they sell drugs for money and use that
35:23 as liquid cash it's untraceable
35:25 they will buy guns at a low price that
35:30 are illegal to be given to a natural
35:31 citizen and they sell those across the
35:33 border and they get megatons of drugs
35:37 that they can sell at a million times
35:41 the value of the gun they just gave away
35:43 this kind of stuff happens but let's
35:47 just say but clean all these folks out
35:50 well if we still have all these liberal
35:53 agendas out there that
35:58 individuals aren't really right in their
36:00 head and we formalize protecting being
36:04 mentally insane instead of putting them
36:07 in hospitals or quarantine quarantine
36:10 them in their own world such that they
36:13 can live a full life as they wish but
36:17 then they don't really influence anybody
36:18 they expire and that's it okay it could
36:24 be a pedophile it could be a guide
36:26 things he's a turtle right 50 years ago
36:32 if someone someone's kid thought they
36:36 were a turtle
36:38 after pre-adolescent h they would be
36:43 committed until they were brought around
36:47 or until they died some late age
36:49 happiest could be in a mental
36:52 institution today it'll become a gender
36:55 identification in the EU right part of
36:59 it is do no harm right when you think
37:02 we'll the guy thinks he's a turtle's not
37:03 do anyone any harm it's like really does
37:05 he hold down a job but he's live off of
37:08 social pensions you know Social Security
37:12 does you live off of welfare because
37:14 don't wanna [ __ ] hire a guy who
37:16 thinks he's a ninja turtle or whatever
37:19 it's not the kid can take it off and he
37:22 simply wears it at night hey no one's
37:23 worried about that do what you want
37:25 just don't bring sex into it and start
37:27 again luring children with your turtle
37:30 costume at night right but we have a
37:33 situation where we have this sort of we
37:38 have taken freedom of speech and we have
37:41 pushed it to the maximum extreme which
37:44 is probably a valuable exercise for us
37:46 especially if you're a weak yeah but the
37:50 problem is is like don't you pull back
37:54 every once in a while like I've used an
37:56 analogy on the show 100 episodes ago
37:58 where you know when you buy a new piece
38:00 of stereo equipment back in the day
38:03 they're really anything a piece of
38:05 software and you bring up a big master
38:08 control thing back in the day was a
38:10 bunch of knobs and you you don't know
38:14 what it does so you grab the knob it's
38:18 on zero you're listening to music and
38:21 you turn it all the way up and you
38:23 listen to what happens oh [ __ ] that got
38:25 loud back down oh that made a really
38:28 weird echo that flange did I lost the
38:31 radio station I liked get back on that
38:34 radio station okay I you know I'm
38:38 harping on the the biggest problem I
38:42 think that we have outside of our money
38:44 system being completely messed up but
38:46 the money system is a very calculated
38:47 thing with a very calculated left-brain
38:50 fix
38:51 ready to go all right some form of the
38:55 blockchain some form of some virtual
38:57 currency could be put in place we could
39:00 base it on precious metals blah blah
39:01 blah but the thing that's not cut and
39:05 dry is our mental attitude towards each
39:09 other
39:11 our mental attitude towards being an
39:15 adult and being a child what you do as
39:17 an adult with adults and what you do as
39:19 a child with children and then this this
39:23 cross-pollinated realm where you're a
39:26 father your mother and you have children
39:28 you're an uncle your aunt you have
39:29 nephews and nieces you're single and you
39:34 have neighbors kids that you protect and
39:37 then there's the weirdies the fraction
39:40 of a percent of the people on this
39:42 planet who makes adult behaviors with
39:46 children behaviors that needs to perish
39:50 that process needs to stop whatever's
39:54 infecting the mind of an individual to
39:56 get to them to that level it's got to be
39:58 neutralized well again it's like all
40:03 this topics we talk about on this show
40:04 nobody sits around talking about this
40:06 really other than to say I don't get it
40:08 man
40:09 if you're normal you're just like
40:10 completely [ __ ] mystified how does
40:12 this happen
40:14 alright you know we used to think that
40:18 there was a sector of society especially
40:22 if you studied Catholic Church that is
40:24 more prone to do this to children that
40:28 may actually still be true but boy I've
40:30 got plenty of stories in my own personal
40:32 friends circles where they've had
40:34 problems with people that were just as
40:36 on the outside just as normal as anyone
40:38 they're married to the opposite sex so
40:41 I'm not sure there is any one group of
40:44 people that's more prone to did this and
40:45 I'm by no means remotely an expert of
40:50 any kind expert would be three or four
40:53 times higher than what I am right I'm
40:56 just an observer just like you but I
40:58 will tell you that you know as an artist
41:03 who has to do plenty of research online
41:05 so what happens if you're an artist and
41:07 this a lot of you will have this
41:11 experience you're hard to create some
41:15 artwork and you'll go on google and
41:19 you'll search you click images as soon
41:22 as you do that no matter how much
41:24 security you have
41:25 or safe filtering you have on stuff
41:28 slips through and you're like holy [ __ ]
41:32 when did we get to this level right you
41:36 will search on something completely
41:37 benign and you will find unbelievable
41:43 extremes of human interaction physically
41:45 sex right all of us have seen porn
41:49 usually if you haven't then you're the
41:53 winner
41:54 seriously I've had my whole run of that
41:58 crap as a young man I've talked about it
42:02 from time to time but we have websites
42:04 out there that have no protection you
42:07 can be a eight-year-old kid and
42:11 accidentally type in the URL or
42:13 intentionally type in a URL or a search
42:15 algorithm and you can find stuff so many
42:18 websites out there bait-and-switch safe
42:21 content
42:21 - really intense content and the child
42:26 in some cases will run into these sites
42:29 that are like hey I got some fun videos
42:31 for you here click over here and then
42:33 you got the gateway length it's kind of
42:36 soft porn and then you didn't that soft
42:38 porn site has the super hardcore crazy
42:39 [ __ ] and then a fad is like all your
42:41 snuff films or people getting your heads
42:43 to cut off right there's no protection
42:48 all right one of the executive orders
42:51 that the President of the United States
42:52 just signed in December of last year has
42:56 resulted in the closing of several sort
43:00 of dating sites where people find each
43:02 other because they're holding these
43:05 sites responsible for what happens to
43:07 the people who use the service so
43:09 Craigslist for instance used to have
43:12 some dating thing on there and they
43:14 would connect people well we've had
43:18 dozens and dozens of kids get murdered
43:19 and killed and disappeared we have
43:22 plenty of open unsolved mysteries in the
43:25 United States of America due to
43:26 Craigslist because they baited people
43:29 baited little kids you know that we're
43:31 like oh you don't like your mommy daddy
43:32 don't you well yeah you know what if I
43:34 sent you a plane ticket or a
43:36 I guess it's usually a bus ticket right
43:38 because you have to have any ID
43:40 these kids go off and disappear alright
43:43 I'll meet you at the Burger King so
43:45 that's progress that's progress as much
43:50 as it sucks that we have the [ __ ]
43:53 weirdos to mess it up for everyone
43:54 really thought let me throw you another
43:55 one how many of you get spam right yeah
44:01 there's a big war on spam kinda but I
44:05 guarantee you they could ban domains and
44:11 ban IPs and they do they do do this but
44:14 they could do a hell of a lot better job
44:16 right but what happens as soon as you
44:19 sign up for free email from someone they
44:21 sell your email to someone they read all
44:24 your email they sell your friends email
44:27 list so you're like hey man I don't want
44:29 to be on any spam list I don't to be
44:31 associated with any political [ __ ]
44:33 or sex [ __ ] but you have that one
44:36 friend you meet at a party and they're a
44:37 business person they have a legitimate
44:39 business want to be involved in but he
44:41 also have a Gmail or they mail their
44:43 girlfriend like some Anthony Weiner dude
44:45 and he's sending pedophile pictures off
44:48 or sending pictures of himself to a
44:50 minor right and through two degrees of
44:53 separation your email is now in the
44:56 batch imagine getting indicted and
44:58 having to show up in court simply
45:00 because you did a business transaction
45:01 with someone this is where we are today
45:04 right why not an executive order that
45:07 says if a website tries to put a virus
45:09 on your phone it's illegal the reason
45:13 why I'm doing this digression is very
45:15 specific and it is this we're gonna have
45:18 to start looking at the systemic causes
45:20 of this stuff because God may not show
45:22 up 100% but maybe God is inspiring
45:25 thoughts like this anyway and just
45:28 saying
45:30 I give you the complete domain to do
45:34 whatever you want to do don't I
45:36 you could swerve your car into traffic
45:38 oncoming traffic and kill a whole family
45:40 of five
45:41 you could you could be that [ __ ] or
45:43 that [ __ ] crazy person I allow you to
45:46 do that
45:48 but you don't do you imagine being
45:52 someone who and again a lie strip or
45:54 godless it's fine but imagine ever
45:56 meeting your creator and you're you're
45:58 standing up for I don't know freedom of
46:01 speech in the realm of sex online you
46:05 don't want to have anyone stop a porn
46:08 site from existing because a min you
46:11 know it's like I have a problem meeting
46:13 other people so I need this stuff and I
46:16 don't have to click through age
46:17 verification thing are you telling that
46:20 to God just imagine that that's just the
46:23 funniest thing for some Supreme Being
46:26 it's like I am making human beings to
46:28 prosper I'm not making human beings that
46:31 that you can sacrifice them in any
46:34 metaphor of the meaning of sacrificing
46:38 them didn't have to be some huge devil
46:42 worshipping thing but you know you get
46:46 your kids strung out on a bunch of fatty
46:50 foods and you don't do anything as a
46:52 parent because you're fat and you're
46:53 like I have a whole family of fatness
46:55 and and it makes me feel like I'm in a
46:59 club and I don't look in the mirror and
47:01 feel bad cuz my kids are fat too but
47:03 then your kid dies at like 25 or some
47:06 goddamn heart attack and you cry like
47:09 someone else did it other than yourself
47:11 you did it you know not as good whatever
47:15 we have to take responsibility okay
47:18 the other reason I bring this up is even
47:24 if God came back
47:26 and it's not the end of times he's not
47:28 taking all the souls somewhere because
47:31 they're already there right as soon as
47:33 you die your soul takes off man you're
47:34 not sitting in some goddamn grave
47:36 waiting for a [ __ ] Judgment Day but a
47:39 load of [ __ ] right how many people
47:43 existed before that stupid theory came
47:45 around what happened to them well I got
47:47 an excuse for that too all right
47:51 whatever but here's the thing
47:54 what if talking to God is nothing more
47:57 than a beautiful rhetorical conversation
47:59 of responsibility he asks you no
48:02 question that you don't already know the
48:04 answer to except these questions have a
48:07 lot more impact on your relationship
48:10 with him
48:12 in universe whatever god that's what I
48:16 call him they simply says look did you
48:19 not know that children could find this
48:21 content
48:23 well yeah what was your opinion about
48:27 that does a First Amendment right make
48:33 it okay for you to [ __ ] with my perfect
48:36 creation well no then why did you allow
48:41 it to Kentucky children what did you
48:44 actually do does it have to be your
48:48 child for you to care well you know
48:51 freedom man and he knows right at that
48:56 moment at all times that you know you
48:58 [ __ ] up you look the other way
49:00 maybe you perverted yourself and hey
49:03 we're all flawed in some way shape or
49:05 form when and if a Great Awakening were
49:08 to occur and whether or not it has
49:10 anything to do with a celestial being I
49:14 think that we should probably check
49:17 ourselves to simply say have we
49:19 exhausted all of what we know about
49:21 right and wrong you know when you look
49:25 at Wars do you write a blank check well
49:30 once are good as long as my preacher
49:33 tells me they're good I used to visit a
49:35 church and Hermosa Beach and again I
49:39 said this probably hundred episodes ago
49:41 but the idea was that I'd read the
49:42 pamphlet when I went in and it would
49:45 have these nice you know prayers that
49:49 you could say for folks in the church
49:51 that we're dealing with something
49:52 illness loss of life or something and
49:55 that was beautiful I thought you know we
49:57 do need to put our minds around this to
49:59 send them our love and all that good
50:01 stuff then they would need flip over and
50:03 it would start justifying wars going on
50:05 all in the sense of religion all of it
50:10 either we're protecting the Israelites
50:11 or we're protecting Christians being
50:14 persecuted in the world and it was sort
50:16 of a backhanded prayer to say kill those
50:20 other people right vision guide coming
50:25 in sitting down grabbing the pamphlet
50:27 looking the preacher in the face and he
50:29 just goes who wrote this
50:33 who approved this well I was this sent
50:37 in my house right I think a lot of us
50:40 would love to see God go visit his
50:41 houses all around the world
50:43 do a little reckoning right I don't
50:47 think we're doing much I should say
50:50 prior to this awaking I don't think we
50:52 have done much to take care of the world
50:56 to do we know is right versus wrong and
51:01 that's a very dangerous thing I know
51:03 right Here I am almost ironically
51:06 repeating the virus which is you know
51:10 inquisitions and Crusades were all based
51:13 on one group they can they had it all
51:16 figured out they run around killing and
51:19 I'm not talking about any violent
51:20 activity at all I'm talking about one
51:23 making a personal choice starting with a
51:25 man in the mirror is Michael Jackson
51:27 would say and trying to say okay if I
51:30 don't pollute my mind with this content
51:36 I change as a human being like I've keep
51:38 going on and on - or if you turn off
51:40 your TV your world becomes amazing and
51:42 Steve Jobs always refused to have a
51:45 television in his house for a long time
51:47 before he got married like us married
51:50 the first time and finally had his
51:53 family he didn't have a sofa because he
51:55 said what do you do on a sofa you
51:57 sitting you do nothing I think that's
52:00 brilliant okay so you start with
52:03 yourself you hopefully get your words
52:07 all Smith down such that you can
52:09 communicate the value of what you've
52:11 done for yourself especially if anyone
52:13 to buyers the quality of your life you
52:15 say well you know what's strange I'm not
52:17 trying to preach at your anything but I
52:19 am gonna preach what I do to the world
52:22 and if you think that's good then you
52:23 listen this is what I do I don't do this
52:25 that this I don't personally own a sofa
52:28 me alright but now think about you know
52:34 an organization shutting down a dating
52:36 site in fact there was another dating
52:37 site that I never heard of it was like
52:39 all this is national news you know or
52:41 his site was seized by the FBI and its
52:43 advertisers were seized by the FBI
52:47 all of the negativity in the world that
52:48 was simply removed by those gestures and
52:52 that's pretty militant that's pretty
52:54 intense it'd be nice if we could just
52:57 simply behave and go you know what you
52:59 know I'm gonna make this website for
53:00 adults and it's gonna have some sort of
53:02 front door and so perversion at least
53:05 has to be vetted strictly to adults now
53:10 it doesn't mean the perversion can
53:11 continue but if we have a chance to
53:15 reset how do we not [ __ ] it up again
53:18 right let's say God comes down this is
53:21 the Age of Aquarius right isn't that the
53:23 next epoch it goes from from Pisces to
53:26 Aquarius something like that and he
53:29 resets it and then he leaves and it
53:31 takes a couple generations 60 years or
53:33 so and it starts to going into fables
53:36 that he really was here was here and we
53:38 start forgetting maybe that that's where
53:39 we got the information maybe that's how
53:41 he works but maybe not but the next
53:45 generation goes yeah you know God was
53:46 here I guess you know whatever yeah we
53:49 went to the moon once way mm-hmm you
53:51 know growing up in the Midwest you know
53:56 yeah you have these gigantic families
53:58 it's they were very close to each other
54:00 and there's a bunch of them still there
54:02 so they're super close to each other and
54:04 they don't have all this rebellious
54:07 [ __ ] but is the more you get to the
54:11 city-slicker realm of the world you have
54:13 all this rebellion in the Midwest you
54:17 will have white-trash families that
54:19 binge-watch city-slicker stuff right
54:23 it's pimps and hoes and whatever yeah
54:27 it's funny when I went to the Midwest
54:28 this last this year the amount of white
54:34 guys trying to be bangers and other
54:38 cultures all trying to be bangers all
54:41 trying to be hard all trying to pretend
54:43 like they live in LA they were this
54:46 character of Los Angeles well Los
54:50 Angeles had this little flash and the
54:52 pan of about a decade of super crazy
54:57 behavior
54:58 hiim in East LA has calmed down
55:01 south-central has calmed down it has but
55:07 it's being kept alive by this infection
55:11 of the mind but it's hard to correct it
55:15 right we know that there's a lot of
55:19 touch points for influence on society
55:22 you have one of the funny ones is that
55:25 you have women today that are really
55:28 trying to date safe and marry safe
55:30 everything's safe safe safe and you know
55:32 after about 20 years of that crap
55:34 they're like who are you like why did I
55:38 marry you I don't get it yeah maybe I'm
55:40 comfortable whatever but Jesus I'm
55:42 [ __ ] dying every second I'm alive and
55:45 then you have the girl that likes the
55:48 bad boy right it almost never pans out
55:51 ever ever pans out they usually die the
55:54 barren of any children and or if they do
55:57 they got 15 you know baby daddies and
56:01 life just sucks and the funny thing is
56:05 the ironic thing is is that those that
56:08 go back to the 1950s sort of nucleus or
56:11 nuclear family I should say you got a
56:14 mom and dad and you got some kids the
56:16 boy got the girl whatever doesn't matter
56:18 what the combination is and you sort of
56:21 loved each other and behaved and respect
56:23 each other and you communicating with
56:25 your children so they didn't run off and
56:26 become these little bastards they didn't
56:29 have this super rejection phase of their
56:32 life or they hate their parents I mean
56:33 today is in the big city it's almost a
56:36 common standard that a kid around 13 14
56:40 start slipping off to their parents in
56:42 ways that would get your ass beaten I
56:44 mean you know not drunk parent bloody
56:47 beating but just you know you know you
56:49 definitely gotta talk into your dress
56:51 smacked while we're the other and you
56:54 get back into line right but usually
56:56 that didn't have to happen in the
56:57 Midwest right where I came from people
57:00 just behaved oh my god
57:01 what a goddamn
57:04 amazing thing right the thing is this
57:09 well I'm trying to get out is I think
57:12 it'll be embarrassing regardless of what
57:16 you believe in a religious realm again
57:18 atheists probably stop listening already
57:20 but if you're still paying attention I'm
57:22 sure you're laughing your head off but
57:24 the idea is if God were to ever come
57:25 back in any way shape or form we have a
57:28 choice of how we meet him we meet him
57:32 with our heads hand hung low and our
57:34 tail between our legs knowing that we
57:37 didn't do anything to make the world
57:39 better even though we knew exactly how
57:41 to do it does let me run off and kill
57:44 people that do bad things no no no okay
57:47 fix yourself influence your friends and
57:49 family with a nice example of who you
57:52 are perhaps lobby for control over
57:56 things that are systemic to all the
57:59 problems that we have just bring up the
58:01 conversation I have brought up to my
58:04 closest male friends this notion of you
58:08 guys have all seen a porn site right
58:11 yeah and we're watching YouTube right
58:13 now we're all happy about all these
58:14 pedophiles getting nailed right right
58:17 and we don't like that right right
58:19 even a bunch of guys don't have kids
58:20 right either they're too young and they
58:22 haven't had him yet or whatever and then
58:25 I look and I'm gonna say okay we get rid
58:26 of all these guys now what Arnel the
58:30 porn sites wide open then we have movie
58:34 after movie after movie glorifying war
58:36 like I said in season one I have a
58:39 friend a friend that went to war to get
58:45 his kill count from a video game to be
58:48 real
58:50 he struggles every single day but the
58:53 fact that he did kill people now but he
58:57 was influenced by a videogame to run off
58:59 and do that
59:00 I've got episodes where I talked about
59:01 how the military infiltrated the video
59:03 game business to make this happen how I
59:07 met a woman from some secret base in
59:09 England who sent me a hundred and
59:10 thirty-six page questionnaire about how
59:15 do we get kids to lust for war within
59:17 videogames like what really by the way I
59:23 have searched for that email and I've
59:25 got all the emails from that era and
59:27 either I don't know how to find it
59:29 or I can't find it really interesting my
59:34 suggestion is to meet your maker as a
59:38 pioneer of what your maker would want
59:40 the world to be and again it's not gonna
59:45 probably be through means of some
59:47 militant action it's it's going to be
59:52 well I here's the way I'll put it to you
59:54 I think that if you try to accomplish it
60:00 through some mental tactic again self
60:04 family work world whatever order you
60:07 want to do it in you know you could have
60:09 epiphanies that help you in different
60:12 realms right
60:13 you will have so much success in doing
60:16 this that there won't need to be
60:20 anything violent that occurs you know we
60:26 can't control what they might try to do
60:27 to us if we start shutting down their
60:29 party sure maybe they try something
60:32 militant against us and then we're
60:34 simply defending ourselves but I think
60:37 that if the Internet has proven one
60:39 thing it is that just simply
60:41 communicating is enough to really affect
60:46 any change that we think might need to
60:48 happen if you're utterly and completely
60:51 or you know people that are utterly and
60:53 completely addicted to the things that
60:54 I've mentioned and you feel like you
60:56 have control like I don't like kids
60:59 I like older women or older men or
61:03 whatever okay all right maybe you have
61:05 no risk of turning into one of these
61:10 individuals but perhaps what you could
61:12 do is simply say but you're right you
61:15 know
61:15 I don't want my nephew Bernice to ever
61:18 find this stuff or someone else I love
61:20 children I would want any kid to find
61:21 this until they're mature enough to take
61:23 care of it why do we have legal limits
61:25 for drinking alcohol legal limits for
61:27 smoking tobacco right legal limits for
61:31 voting because there's a certain level
61:35 of maturity that will help you determine
61:37 how far to take it whether or not you
61:39 should get into it and you know I think
61:41 that in the end every single thing that
61:44 you want is a regimen in life should
61:46 come with some sort of explanation well
61:48 why would I want to vote well because if
61:50 you don't this is what can happen that's
61:52 a special interest groups they could
61:54 just over one on the voting booths with
61:55 their special interest people and then
61:56 you find yourself living in some
61:58 dystopian you know Orwellian universe oh
62:02 okay that makes sense yeah so it's
62:04 important that you understand that if it
62:06 says Patriot Act is probably without you
62:08 know getting rid of the corrupt
62:09 politicians it's probably anything other
62:11 than patriotic if it says net neutrality
62:13 is anything other than net neutrality
62:14 right they always named things
62:17 nefariously and the opposite symbolism
62:19 of what they are perhaps that'll change
62:21 right but does anyone ever explain the
62:25 ramifications of
62:27 binge drinking on your first beer what
62:31 cocaine can do you on your first line
62:33 what perhaps obsessing on porn can do to
62:37 you
62:37 I was pretty I was pretty I don't know
62:43 free to listen to everyone you talked to
62:46 me I was always fairly inquisitive as
62:48 you might imagine with my friends and I
62:49 don't remember anyone telling me
62:51 anything
62:52 it was always home we get to do this
62:54 what is this oh the thing that weren't
62:56 forbidden from doing oh okay I think one
63:00 of the most endearing things that occurs
63:02 in my life is in the rare situations
63:07 because it'll happen where say for
63:10 instance a porn is mentioned in a
63:13 conversation and there's a female in the
63:16 room or I'm talking to a female in some
63:17 way shape or form they're mentioning it
63:20 because they've dealt with problems of
63:22 it or something like that what
63:23 boyfriends or whatever and they don't
63:25 have any experience with it or you know
63:29 we know people lie but you can tell
63:31 certain people just absolutely turn
63:33 purple with the slightest you know
63:36 mention of the subject yeah yeah that
63:38 person actually doesn't have any
63:40 experience with that how awesome you
63:43 know meeting a kid who doesn't lose
63:45 their virginity at 12 you know it's nice
63:47 it's like oh you waited till you found
63:49 someone you really liked and you were
63:50 over 18 unbelievable I'm not judging
63:54 it's just nice that people do wait
63:56 everyone so well now I've kind of feel
63:58 like that's starting to happen and again
64:01 I'm not saying one thing is right or
64:03 wrong I started way too early as I
64:06 either mentioned in an episode that's
64:07 coming up or I've already mentioned
64:10 episode that's been released the
64:13 ramifications for everything but we
64:16 hardly ever tell each other about that
64:18 stuff do we and I think that one thing
64:21 that drives this whole thing is that if
64:23 you don't have a love in your life that
64:25 is productive you're dangerous
64:28 right I kept myself busy as a kid with
64:33 art music computer programming and I was
64:38 always creating creating creating
64:40 by the time I turned 17 graduated high
64:43 school I was in California by myself in
64:45 my car on a crazy adventure I was doing
64:49 things with grownups and it was fun and
64:51 they were fun and you know so what do
64:55 you do if you're a bored child
64:57 that is looking into a telephone 24/7
65:00 24/7 and your [ __ ] parents are like
65:02 here's your phone Jimmy and they take
65:04 all these goddamn snapshots of their kid
65:06 looking at a phone and put them on
65:09 social media isn't that funny but older
65:11 my kids so smart they could figure out
65:13 an iPad oh really
65:15 really was that like a it was like a
65:17 Mensa society admission test no that was
65:19 like brain-dead [ __ ] you gave your kid a
65:22 brain-dead device with the brain-dead
65:23 app on it yeah you know your kid knows
65:25 how to click fruit and be a fruit ninja
65:29 Wow Jesus aerospace industry here we
65:34 come right and five years like you never
65:37 get off your phone pay attention to your
65:39 mother when she's talking to you it's
65:40 like well dad mom you gave this to me
65:45 right in fact you set the expectation
65:47 that I get I don't know 400 to $1000
65:51 devices every two years because that's
65:53 what I'm entitled to plus you pay the
65:55 subscription fee for my cell phone you
65:57 play my playstation or xbox subscription
66:00 you buy the Xbox you buy all my games
66:02 that are 80 bucks apiece it's uh but I
66:05 always tell you how much that game
66:06 sucked that you just gave away eighty
66:08 bucks
66:09 very lucky I didn't go through this
66:11 personally with my kid or with myself in
66:14 any significant way but it happens right
66:17 it would seem that we have been left
66:20 alone to [ __ ] up this planet pretty bad
66:23 it would seem that a lot of folks are
66:25 sick and tired of this [ __ ]
66:27 what can we do can we do something
66:31 personally to make things better
66:34 obviously the answer is yes we can do a
66:36 bunch of stuff
66:39 but now let's just in closing here let's
66:41 let's put this into some cool scenario
66:44 right about schools and air cools near
66:47 have you ever had anyone come into a
66:49 room that was just full of wisdom and
66:52 they had like you were bored to death as
66:56 an uncle it was a neighbor it was
66:58 somebody maybe you met a rock star or
67:00 whatever the hell you dig and they came
67:02 in and they just maybe had a couple
67:04 things with them it looked good and for
67:08 whatever reason the moment was
67:09 captivating and it changed your entire
67:11 opinion about everything it was easy it
67:15 was comfortable and it changed your life
67:20 that's what we have to figure out how to
67:23 do with others is to simply say hey kids
67:28 are you bored and like hell yeah we're
67:30 bored well how'd you like to do
67:34 something really really cool son that
67:37 will become a permanent part of your
67:39 character of your vocational skills and
67:43 hey you can take it as far as you want
67:45 to take it and the way you take it is
67:48 way different than I'm gonna take it or
67:49 I have taken it right again the arts are
67:52 a beautiful place to start
67:55 preoccupies you but any skill on earth
67:58 anything they can get into I know a
68:01 bunch of you that have kids that you
68:03 know of where they never had a book in
68:06 their life they picked up Harry Potter
68:07 or whatever and they just sort of binge
68:10 reading like oh my god and after a while
68:13 you know for a first maybe five books
68:15 like what do you read what do you read
68:16 my kid did this god she devoured
68:19 hundreds of books big-ass thick ass
68:22 books right it was it's my policy with
68:25 her as I said look as long as you finish
68:27 the book I'll go get you the hardback
68:29 we'll go to Barnes & Noble I'll give you
68:32 a budget and you if you can get 50 books
68:35 for whatever amount of money I'm gonna
68:37 give you honestly to myself I said
68:39 there's no limit just read the books you
68:41 know we limited she was kind of self
68:43 regularly done about five books but she
68:46 would just mow through them and I'd ask
68:48 her the endings and the middles in the
68:50 beginning
68:50 and she knew him it's great kept her
68:55 away from crap we have to reinvent
68:59 society remember the theme of the show
69:01 is to rebuild society from the bottom up
69:04 if what I think is occurring in 2018 is
69:10 very black and white is actually
69:12 occurring then for me it feels like this
69:15 is probably one of the most exciting
69:17 times to be alive
69:18 ever ever
69:22 this is like potentially potentially
69:25 history book level stuff as long as we
69:27 don't get cock-blocked by the idiots
69:31 that do the things that they do and
69:33 because of all this cascading
69:36 compounding positivity
69:40 still needs to become an eventualities
69:41 out of cases but it looks like it's
69:43 going in that direction here
69:46 it feels godly and that's what's
69:50 inspired this whole notion in my brain
69:52 of like
69:54 then it just go downhill in the United
69:56 States of America
69:57 you know the skullenbones arrived in the
70:00 1830s we fight a good fight but then we
70:04 lose in 1913 they take three or four
70:08 decades to take over the give us
70:10 horrible decade after decade after
70:12 decade but we have a couple little
70:14 moments where we pop out there's a baby
70:17 boomer thing they beget in the Korean
70:18 War and we go into the nuclear area we
70:21 go into Vietnam we pop out we have a
70:23 good 15 years but then it just gets
70:25 attacked by all these social programs
70:28 and social programming and all kinds of
70:31 shows on television and movies and
70:34 culture and music right and we've just
70:38 had enough right there's only so many
70:42 decades we can eat shitty food and
70:45 continue doing it we want to change and
70:47 the trend is be healthy be smart love
70:52 each other I figure out how to pull all
70:53 those things off right protect the
70:56 innocent
70:56 it's probably one of the biggest ones
70:59 people are becoming more spiritual now
71:01 than they ever have and I don't just
71:03 mean the cooks that walk around trying
71:07 to upstage everyone in the room with
71:09 their previous life experience you know
71:11 and there's people who do that people
71:14 who mention their previous life
71:15 experiences that they believe they've
71:16 had one that don't do that but there are
71:19 people that just don't want to listen to
71:20 anyone else and those are the scumbags
71:22 we got to just go you know whatever
71:24 you're not invited to the next party by
71:26 we pack your [ __ ] and go go find your
71:29 [ __ ] other psychic friends you want
71:31 to listen to you only your story in life
71:32 right
71:33 had a friend bring me a really funny
71:36 story by going to a retreat and a woman
71:38 was there and it's all ladies and they
71:41 everyone was really cool and they're all
71:44 varying ages I mean it was like from
71:45 like the early 20s all the way almost to
71:48 80 years old I won crunchy woman was in
71:52 there and every time she talked it was
71:55 apparent and she wasn't listening to
71:57 anyone else's story she would just it's
72:01 there was a there was a character the
72:02 Kristen Wiig played on Saturday Night
72:04 Live where she was always topping
72:05 everyone she'd circled her here
72:07 and questions like this and the likeness
72:10 was of that type of attitude and I've
72:14 had you know acquaintances of my own
72:17 that I have met that are very much like
72:20 that they got their life has completely
72:23 [ __ ] up I mean calling me ball on
72:27 their [ __ ] brains out on the phone
72:29 but but they had no humility and always
72:34 would tell me how to live my life
72:38 sitting there going wait a minute
72:41 you can't manage your life for five
72:43 minutes without crying and doing drugs
72:45 but you're gonna lecture me about my
72:48 life which is pretty [ __ ] amazing
72:51 pretty great right now give me a break
72:54 that's the kind of stuff that we've
72:56 allowed to manifest through all this
72:59 sort of I don't know pasta fiying our
73:04 entire plant there's some video right
73:06 now that it's been promoted on YouTube
73:08 for I don't know three or four days
73:10 about crying you know and it's not hey a
73:15 good cry is a good cry man and I've had
73:17 some [ __ ] amazing cries I've talked
73:19 about on the show reuniting with old
73:22 girlfriends where we're not going to get
73:23 back together anything but there were
73:25 unresolved issues and all I needed to do
73:27 I was holding a 20-year cry and I bawled
73:29 my brains out and I felt awesome and it
73:31 went away
73:32 yeah sure there's a place for crying
73:34 sure absolutely don't cry
73:36 so that was huge for me right but
73:38 they're trying to cultivate this you
73:42 should cry all the time and you should
73:44 extort out of your [ __ ] family all of
73:46 this aid because you just can't get your
73:49 life together right you never nut up and
73:52 become an adult there's no mother of
73:54 invention to solving your [ __ ]
73:56 problems it's just burden burden burden
73:59 it's just like where you walk all life
74:01 dies behind you right we have got to
74:05 [ __ ] get rid of this right and you
74:08 can't get rid of it by telling someone
74:09 knock it off necessarily my family it
74:12 works but if you go well why don't we
74:17 just take a break from all that you know
74:21 pity party you got going on and let's go
74:23 over here and you know you like to do
74:25 that one little thing when you're crying
74:27 you know you make things out of your
74:29 tears well you don't have to use your
74:31 tears we can actually use you know
74:34 something else over here and you can
74:36 actually make something productive with
74:38 your life being control distract
74:42 yourself it's positive right when you do
74:44 that you feel positive okay well how
74:46 about you fill your life with a bunch of
74:47 positivity you know again the I
74:52 mentioned just recently in an episode
74:54 about going to boot camp it's like
74:56 that's where you do it
74:57 that's where little boys show up to
75:00 become men and whether or not they're
75:03 brainwashed or not at the end they
75:05 certainly know how to behave if they
75:06 don't drop out you know I would imagine
75:08 that the dropout rate in the military
75:10 and boot camp is a lot higher than it
75:13 used to be but maybe that's wrong I
75:14 don't know hope not our young men and
75:18 women enjoy a little bit of structure in
75:21 their life hopefully don't send them off
75:25 for stupid Wars and you don't hurt
75:26 inject them with crazy [ __ ] but you
75:31 shouldn't have to go join the military
75:32 to get such training right your parents
75:34 should not up and get in there and make
75:35 it happen you know our parents aren't
75:39 our best friends they're our parents
75:40 you only get one set of both friends
75:43 will come and go BFFs will come and go
75:47 if you're a mom you're way better than a
75:50 best friend if you're a father your way
75:52 best than the best way better than a
75:54 best friend right you just are a brother
75:57 a sister you know but if all you can be
76:02 is a best friend well a lot of us call
76:04 our best friends our brothers and our
76:06 sisters right anyway I bounced around
76:09 this one for quite a while and that was
76:11 pretty pretty jumbled hopefully you saw
76:15 the connections between things it's a
76:19 touchy subject to tell someone to nut up
76:21 it's really touchy how dare you how dare
76:23 you tell me to nut up take
76:26 responsibility for myself it's got a
76:29 politician that says that you'll pay my
76:32 rent I think I like that plan a lot
76:34 better they
76:36 that's coming to an end folks let me
76:41 know what you think in the comments if
76:43 you haven't been already go to deep
76:45 thoughts radio com that's the
76:48 source for all things deep thoughts
76:51 there's an audio podcast down there
76:53 there's the video there's a lakh
76:56 Facebook group and there's a patreon
76:57 page I've had a few of you asked me for
77:00 t-shirts and of course this is going in
77:03 a video so this will come and go in
77:05 terms of its availability but I've been
77:07 thinking about some for a long time some
77:11 of them are redos different phraseology
77:15 on ones I have seen so I put a couple
77:20 out there I'm probably gonna link them
77:22 from the website so you guys can get
77:23 them yeah there's a profit involved but
77:26 honestly it's just a matter of I think I
77:29 would like this for myself I took the
77:33 suggested retail prices they gave me and
77:35 I reduced it quite a few dollars for the
77:38 quality of shirt that's there so it's
77:39 not a huge huge cash cow or anything
77:43 like that but I thought it'd be cool
77:45 again I want to upgrade to a 4k camera
77:46 like that'd be cool it's just a lot of
77:49 low light stuff we can do and need
77:51 things that might come out of that but
77:56 anyway take care of yourself and someone
77:57 else and I'll see in the next two deep
77:59 thoughts
