00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentlemen okay it's 52 degrees out here
00:36 I wasn't aware of how freezing cold it
00:40 was until I decided to go ahead and pump
00:43 on these out I tend to be doing these
00:45 and then going to bed because they get
00:47 really nice and tired so you know you
00:50 guys I've been doing episodes of all
00:53 kinds right and you know it's as you
00:58 might guess it's not easy coming up with
01:00 interesting new topics and so you know I
01:06 mean I go after the ones that you know I
01:09 find all over the internet because those
01:13 are interesting as well you know flat
01:14 earth and dinosaurs and moon hoax and
01:17 ghosts and all that kind of stuff
01:20 part of me likes just having some
01:23 subjects that are just ours you know
01:26 just our little way I think the dream
01:27 episodes are fairly original but here's
01:30 what's interesting this episode I think
01:34 I'm gonna call it how we don't think and
01:39 what that means is we are so regimented
01:43 in our existence that we don't even
01:48 notice it and I was reading up on some
01:52 real esoteric things and you know we
01:57 talked about being in the matrix every
01:58 once in a while done at least two
02:00 episodes directly on the matrix then we
02:04 have the flat earth community and within
02:07 the flat earth community you have
02:08 several different flavors of Flat Earth
02:09 you have dome firmament dome Flat Earth
02:14 you have purely ice-barrier flat earth
02:17 with other continents on the other side
02:18 of that rim and then of course you have
02:22 heliocentric you have me expanding earth
02:25 which is something I got off Neil Adams
02:27 and then again the more I look at it the
02:30 more it just is for me just completely
02:32 undeniable something occurred to me the
02:36 other day that
02:37 you know here's an example of where
02:39 we're debating whether or not we're in a
02:41 ball or a flat disc or some other
02:44 gigantic ball but in terms of our use of
02:49 the ball it's just the disc sort of like
02:54 if you put the contact lens down on top
02:56 of the earth but the earth is you know
02:58 hundred times bigger but now let's say
03:02 it's a flatter thing and let's say it's
03:05 God flutters here's something I've never
03:09 heard really brought up and if you've
03:12 heard it and you got a good video on it
03:14 please link it down below but it goes
03:16 something like this there's a lot of
03:19 debate out there what's interesting
03:23 about it is I see debates on Flat Earth
03:25 which are very compartmentalized and I
03:29 like those better meaning they're not
03:32 citing a pre-existing documentation
03:37 they're just simply going outside and
03:39 looking but I saw another video it was
03:42 posted on the big ten posted on the
03:46 Facebook page and it was a guy who was
03:50 talking about the elliptical orbit of
03:52 Earth around the Sun and his point was
03:57 that an ellipses changes the velocity of
04:00 the body that's on the ellipses you
04:03 can't go the same speed and achieve an
04:06 ellipses because if you're going in the
04:07 same speed you'd have a more perfectly
04:09 circular orbit and so his contingency
04:13 was that any speed at even 1% or a
04:18 percent of a percent would so change our
04:22 speed that we would liquefy that that
04:25 everything would be thrown off of Earth
04:27 again there's a couple problems with
04:30 this whole thing because he cited
04:33 Einstein's relativity a screw in stein
04:35 you never thought up anything but the
04:40 idea is we're talking about earth on
04:42 like some pool table you know where
04:46 there's other relative gravity out here
04:48 just like on earth right
04:50 so for instance if I'm a waiter and I'm
04:53 holding a bunch of glasses on him on a
04:56 tray and then I just move really fast
04:58 and turn all the bottles are gonna go
05:00 off to the side and that's because it's
05:03 relative to this planet right the planet
05:06 is the one causing the other force of
05:08 gravity and I'm creating a differential
05:10 and of course the glasses obey the
05:12 bigger force which is the earth and not
05:14 me but in terms of a body moving in
05:17 elliptical orbit what's what's the force
05:21 that's gonna liquify us what's the force
05:22 that's gonna throw us off we're sucked
05:25 down to this freaking ball do tooi throw
05:28 winds just like bubbles and water again
05:32 if you have a bubble can't exist in
05:33 water it's exactly the same exact thing
05:36 water is space the bubble is earth it's
05:40 just we have more solid stuff on the
05:42 inside of our bubble and our water is a
05:45 lot more refined so that could pass
05:50 through us and not hit us tremendously
05:53 the little bit that it does hit us is
05:54 where we get the weak force of gravity
05:57 but the guy crawled into official
05:59 science provided by agencies he doesn't
06:03 trust to prove a point that in my
06:06 opinion is utterly ludicrous if there's
06:10 a way that you can re-expand us so I can
06:11 totally get into it I'm into it let's
06:15 let's go back to how we don't think
06:18 think about the surface of Earth whether
06:22 you think it's flat I think it's round
06:24 this is not gonna be a Flat Earth
06:25 episode necessarily but this is going to
06:26 get us into the realm of how we can
06:29 understand the paradigm adoption that we
06:34 adopt even in our dreams but especially
06:38 when we wake up I think I told you guys
06:40 when I was a kid I used to dream I was a
06:43 molecule and that was my frustration
06:46 dream I would go to bed and I was
06:47 literally like a like a human cell
06:50 packed in with a bunch of other human
06:52 cells and I was so bizarrely
06:55 insignificant and trapped it was that's
06:57 where I got my frustration and I'm like
07:00 you know 3 4 years old
07:03 but look at the surface of the earth
07:06 okay what do we have here we have some
07:10 pretty random looking continents don't
07:13 we just so happens they all fit together
07:17 on all sides there's no Pangaea drift
07:19 it's all expanding earth right here's
07:22 the problem - dying expanding earth even
07:24 if you're vested in some other thing I
07:27 can take a globe of the earth okay and
07:31 peel its skin off you know maybe before
07:34 they put it on the cardboard globe that
07:37 you're gonna have in your library I take
07:38 that geometric skin and I cut out all of
07:41 the continents and then I can push them
07:45 all together and make a soccer ball on
07:48 all sides
07:49 no oceans it all fits together very
07:53 little changing of the shapes of
07:55 anything okay
07:58 how can you adopt anything other than
08:01 that I mean it just does it
08:02 but now the assertion is is that we're
08:06 in a very important place and we have
08:08 this snow globe over us because God is
08:12 right on the other side just looking
08:13 down through that little thing right
08:16 because we need to feel important
08:18 because humans have ego that's but I
08:20 think a lot of this comes from hey man I
08:24 think it's a round ball and it's
08:26 expanding due to ether winds an
08:29 electrical universe plasma injection
08:31 from the Sun somehow I managed to
08:34 maintain my belief in God a thousand
08:37 percent talk to God all the time I don't
08:41 need Jesus at all I don't need that
08:42 fictional story I take from it what is
08:46 good I leave behind what is the tooth
08:48 fairy in Santa Claus there we go
08:52 but if this is a divinely created place
08:56 here's what I find so interesting and
08:59 this is something I have never heard
09:00 mentioned the shape of the continents
09:03 aside from working far as expanding
09:06 earth are completely random there's no
09:09 rhyme or reason we don't have a
09:10 hexagonal continent around continent a
09:13 rectangle continent
09:14 a triangle continent nothing looks like
09:18 it is intentionally created unless you
09:22 talk to Slartibartfast rate vo it's a
09:26 still of making fjords so there's this
09:32 idea that we have this container around
09:35 us and this perfect you know dome over
09:40 the top I guess it's glass or it's a
09:42 force field or whatever it's a water
09:44 bubble alright but then you suggest that
09:47 there's something underneath to hold all
09:49 the stuff down below all the lava and
09:51 crazy stuff down below oil alright and
09:55 obviously plasma energy right if this is
09:58 a firmament dome you got explained Tesla
10:00 and I mentioned this stuff 90 times in
10:02 every episode so that you just barf it
10:05 out when you talk to friends you need to
10:08 know what Tesla did in Colorado Springs
10:10 it is the pivotal point where that
10:13 gentlemen figured out the earth has a
10:15 plasma core and that he could siphon it
10:17 off and give us free energy forever
10:19 because if we get to the next stage of
10:22 energy that's probably who we should
10:24 start at least right
10:26 but now let's just say it's sort of like
10:29 a a pool with dirt in it and something
10:34 electricity I don't know maybe the maybe
10:37 the Christmas light plug is right down
10:38 in the center of this pool and all Tesla
10:42 did was sort of siphon off the power off
10:45 the extension cord to the rest of the
10:47 flat disk thing right but I look at
10:52 other things that gods created the
10:54 Fibonacci pattern which seems to dictate
10:57 so much of our creation look at a mantis
11:01 look at a I don't know anything a wasp a
11:05 human being a bunny rabbit a dog there's
11:08 all kinds of wild symmetry there's
11:11 nothing sort of I mean I'm gonna say
11:15 this and I'm gonna qualify it but in
11:18 terms of the geometric decision making
11:20 of the shape of our continents it
11:24 doesn't appear to have anything super
11:26 divine or designed
11:28 that would match any other living being
11:30 that reside on these continents and that
11:34 seems strange so this is sort of like
11:37 God's old you know days when he was a
11:40 young kid and he was playing with mud
11:43 and making mud castles and all that kind
11:45 of stuff and he was just like okay I'm
11:46 done with that but I'm gonna leave it
11:48 there
11:48 it's totally random then I'm gonna get
11:51 down to business I'm gonna start
11:53 creating Fibonacci pattern plants and
11:56 trees and algae and bushes and roses and
11:59 cactus and all that kind of stuff then
12:01 you know okay well those things are
12:02 rooted into the ground they can't move
12:04 around and they don't have the best
12:07 conversation so you know I bet they
12:09 would but so he starts what he started
12:12 doing I don't know maybe he starts with
12:14 single-cell amoebas plays around with
12:17 that whole thing gets the whole
12:18 heartbeat thing going figures out his
12:20 little Frankenstein you know starting
12:22 point and then starts just you know
12:25 pulling together cells and then you
12:27 start to see something that looks divine
12:29 life right plants for me are very
12:32 divinely created everything that's alive
12:35 on this planet quote-unquote is divinely
12:37 designed in my opinion fish and birds
12:40 and everything right it's just my hunch
12:44 that if this was divinely created as its
12:49 container and it was it was that we were
12:53 supposed to be as close to God as we
12:57 could possibly be without him
12:59 intervening in our life and taking away
13:01 choice you know she has to abstract
13:04 himself away a little bit because if we
13:06 knew all the rules and you know what
13:09 have you we might be automatons you know
13:13 we'd be so scared of breaking the rules
13:15 that we wouldn't really be who we need
13:18 to be all right cool but then it would
13:22 seem strange that he would leave behind
13:26 even the faintest chance that man could
13:30 find the container right because you
13:34 know for all he knows
13:38 the Vikings could have made the decision
13:40 to go south instead of North so here
13:44 they are hauling ass down the coast to
13:47 get to the bottom of Africa and they
13:49 just go let's go out there right we have
13:52 the sea figured out poof they go over or
13:56 whoever goes out there and then let's
13:58 just say and of course he's if it's the
14:01 firmament dome he's made the ocean super
14:03 cold he's made that continent extremely
14:06 formidable has an altitude so it gets
14:08 even colder than the North Pole by sixty
14:10 degrees Fahrenheit but what if that's
14:13 what we did we went down there and of
14:16 course there's evidence that that
14:18 continent wasn't covered in ice at one
14:19 point it was actually fully greened
14:24 which you'd have to explain but man had
14:28 ago went straight for the dome now we're
14:31 in the 21st century according to the
14:33 Flat Earth theory the government went
14:36 down there with what was it Colonel Byrd
14:39 that his name but we went down there and
14:43 we've explored it now we've signed a
14:46 treaty in 1954 getting all these
14:48 countries to say no one goes down there
14:50 without permission well at that point in
14:53 the theory of Flat Earth
14:55 we have rediscovered unequivocally the
14:58 edge of the dome then you have to decide
15:01 what you believe is on the other side is
15:04 that the edge and then there's another
15:05 ocean a tropical and you have continents
15:07 outside of that maybe is it literally
15:11 Doong Doong Doong Doong like the cyclope
15:15 dia britannica talks about they found a
15:16 wall wouldn't a jig be up the second
15:20 that one human being knocks on that
15:22 thing is God gonna be literally on the
15:24 other side go don't tell anybody you
15:26 know don't you go sign a treaty and just
15:28 kind of keep everybody out of here you
15:29 know I had to scare the Nazis off
15:31 because they were down there before you
15:32 bla bla bla bla I keep thinking that if
15:36 this was a god thing it would be
15:40 impossible to go against his will and
15:42 find the edge there'd be no chance of us
15:48 finding the edge
15:49 because if you think about it we have
15:52 how many billionaires in the world now
15:53 thousands of billionaires how much money
15:56 would it take just sit there and go okay
15:59 I'm in Japan I'm in China I'm in America
16:02 I'm in Russia let's build a vehicle they
16:08 can get over any terrain and you can
16:10 build it as big as you want it I got
16:12 money
16:13 here's a billion dollars you can get in
16:16 this thing and you can just drive and
16:19 you're gonna go straight to either the
16:20 South Pole with the flag or you're gonna
16:23 bump into a wall and then it's got
16:26 internet it's a driving house why isn't
16:30 that occurred no-one's ever questioned
16:33 in my experience the shape of the
16:36 continents as it relates to a divine
16:38 creation situation now in my book I
16:42 don't know obviously how this whole
16:46 thing began I know it wasn't a big bang
16:48 but we're here and one of the ways we
16:52 don't think is we don't think in terms
16:54 of is like I've said in a few episodes
16:56 the universe simply is it had no
17:00 beginning it will never end
17:02 what we have is quantifiable stuff that
17:06 can hide in the universe our perception
17:08 of light and electricity is merely ether
17:11 winds being designated as those things
17:14 so the ether oil stuff doesn't pulverize
17:18 into smaller particles because it is the
17:20 smallest particle traveling on a
17:22 constant speed of 50 times the speed of
17:24 light
17:25 roughly whatever that speed is it is
17:27 constant it never slows down if it
17:31 ricochets off another piece of our ether
17:32 will matter and ricochets at exactly 50
17:35 times the speed of light if it goes into
17:36 orbit it's 50 times the speed of light
17:38 if it vortexes out of another funnel
17:41 it's still 50 times the speed of light
17:43 even though vortex is supposed to be
17:45 able to create more acceleration in any
17:50 substances caught in it but then what if
17:58 and this is what's interesting to me
18:00 about how we don't think because it was
18:04 the was a recent definition I read of
18:06 sort of some matrix theories about how
18:09 we wake up mixed in with a little bit of
18:12 multiverse theory this is all just fun
18:15 brain exercises this isn't meant to be
18:18 taken tremendously serious but it could
18:20 actually be a hundred percent true
18:23 there's a lot of you that probably had
18:25 the thought or you've read about it I
18:27 obviously read about it and dream this
18:29 up by myself but the idea is that we
18:32 wake up and when we wake up the universe
18:35 is created for us personally and as we
18:39 go to bed it goes away and we turn into
18:42 a sub universe where we need to rest and
18:44 so you know it's like the holodeck on
18:47 maybe 20% of its power so you don't get
18:49 the full hardlight you don't get full
18:52 instrumentalities your fingers and your
18:54 arms and your hands and every once in a
18:58 while it might overload a little bit in
19:00 that area you take all the energy then
19:03 you create your hands for one little
19:04 scene then you're just floating around
19:07 but what if that's the case what if
19:10 these experiences that we're having and
19:15 the shape of the countenance which it's
19:19 I'm going to negate this in just a
19:20 second but what if the shape of the
19:22 continents were merely this
19:23 serendipitous perception of discovery by
19:26 mankind we perceived lands so we saw
19:30 land and then we had a tiny experience
19:33 with water and then we imagined oceans
19:38 and oceans existed and the coastlines
19:40 are merely the overall consensus of
19:43 man's experience inventing this world to
19:47 create the shapes that are the
19:49 continents now the thing that I think
19:53 contradicts that 100% is that man had no
19:57 perception of Africa and South America
20:01 butting up against each other if you
20:05 study expanding earth and realized that
20:07 a lot of the foliage on all the
20:09 coastlines that connect with all the
20:11 coastlines even
20:12 the Pacific you get the same exact trees
20:14 in California that are over there in
20:16 China and so there definitely has been
20:19 you know more I would say evolution
20:23 where you have more migratory evolution
20:25 where animals like the panda bears over
20:28 there in China and Japan and then we
20:31 don't have him over here on the North
20:33 North America and that could be from all
20:36 kinds of different circumstances where
20:38 bears from Russia you know bred with
20:42 federal polar bear and managed to make a
20:44 panda bear hello fine oh right
20:46 but we adopt so much of our reality from
20:49 the previous day's experience and what's
20:53 phenomenal about you know when you have
20:56 a kid there's a point where your child
20:59 will start to really track reality and
21:06 you could put your finger up there and
21:07 move your fingers around and your kid
21:09 will start looking at your fingers I
21:12 remember when my daughter was born she
21:15 was tracking everybody in the room she
21:17 literally look at me look at her mom
21:18 look at the doctor and she's just been
21:21 out of the womb a few minutes and the
21:25 pediatrician was like that's a really
21:28 good sign your kids really looking
21:29 around completely he knows where she is
21:31 and doesn't know it was like it was
21:33 freaky because as the eyes move around
21:36 that's you know the eyes are the gateway
21:37 to the soul and so when my kid was
21:40 looking around I just thought oh geez
21:42 you know or how long have you been alive
21:44 because you look like you're you know
21:47 totally taking this in without the
21:48 ability to to talk about it we have a
21:52 nine-month gestation in on average
21:55 inside of our human mothers and I always
22:00 wonder about the evolution of the mind
22:02 as it relates especially in my opinion
22:06 to the symbiotic soul you're inside your
22:09 mom it's not necessarily you know it's
22:13 the real world technically speaking but
22:15 you're not really you know you're not
22:16 out yet and then of course she's talking
22:20 and she's eating and she's having all
22:21 kinds of experiences on the outside
22:23 which you're kind of getting on the end
22:24 side but we're slowly sitting there
22:27 building a perception of our body while
22:30 in the womb
22:30 man what's this you know I got this
22:32 thing on my face what is this thing on
22:34 my face it's just like a dog chasing its
22:36 tail it doesn't realize that's a part of
22:38 the dog's body but at some point you
22:43 know we might when we start moving
22:45 around inside of our mothers and kicking
22:47 and all this other stuff we're starting
22:49 to learn we own this mass we own this
22:51 body that we have and then of course
22:56 freedom which is such a such a
23:01 fundamental programming of the human
23:05 mind that the ruling class the
23:09 douchebags the deep state who want to
23:12 remove that from us
23:16 are so narcissistic they haven't figured
23:20 out that you know remember the very
23:24 first time there's probably three
23:26 moments I think when we really
23:30 understand and feel the power of freedom
23:34 now there's the little kid in the mall
23:36 you'll see this all the time when your
23:38 child figures out how to crawl they
23:40 start crawling all over the place when
23:42 they figure out how to walk they start
23:43 walking all over the place and you know
23:45 you see that at the mall where the the
23:47 parent lets go the kid you know they're
23:50 right there but the kids looking at this
23:52 mall going oh my god lights and sound
23:56 and colors and people are happy because
23:58 they're buying things and and the kids
24:00 just walking everywhere and of course
24:02 the parents trying to make sure they
24:04 don't walk out the door go down the
24:05 escalator fall through some railing but
24:09 you can see the happiness and the kids
24:10 face right how about when you ride your
24:14 first bike the freedom tricycles are
24:19 pretty good you know big wheels when I
24:21 was a kid were pretty pretty great but
24:24 they just had a speed threshold they
24:27 kind of made it alright this is good but
24:30 I really like a bicycle because that
24:32 thing goes four times as fast as my
24:33 tricycle right away first time I
24:37 balanced on a bicycle
24:38 I wrote down this old country gravel
24:41 road it was it was unbelievable the
24:47 amount of the feeling I had it wasn't
24:49 just the accomplishment but there was
24:52 something about you know Steve Jobs
24:54 always said you know the bicycle he
24:56 studied you know what's the what's the
24:58 least amount of energy for the most
25:01 energy out that the human body can do to
25:02 travel and it was a man riding a bicycle
25:05 then you drive your first car
25:08 it's amazing you got your own car man
25:11 the thing goes fast you can you know
25:13 there's a little bit status on top of
25:15 that but still it's just being able to
25:17 go where you want when you want the
25:18 first time you get to drive outside of
25:20 your hometown as a teenager because you
25:24 get to go to your friend's house that's
25:25 like you know 30 40 miles away and even
25:28 though you've done it a million times in
25:30 your parents car not you're in charge
25:32 that freedom and then I think when you
25:35 get your first place use your first
25:37 apartment that's a good feeling it's
25:39 just amazing right you go to the store
25:41 and buy your first hangers your first
25:43 ironing board all those basic things or
25:45 trash can all that stuff you need
25:48 freedom interesting right do we really
25:52 think about those touch points often and
25:55 what does it mean that that stuff is
25:58 built into us you know nobody told me
26:01 when I was a kid over him when you start
26:03 balancing this bike and you start going
26:04 down that road it's gonna be the most
26:07 amazing experience of your life nobody
26:09 ever says that effect if anything your
26:12 moments loaded up with 50 thousand ways
26:15 you can kill yourself the second you do
26:17 balance the bike when I think about the
26:20 flatter thing which I didn't intend on
26:23 talking about fire through as much as
26:24 I'm doing right now in this episode but
26:26 one of the ways I perceive the
26:28 possibilities of Flat Earth is to think
26:30 of myself in that Truman Show movie
26:33 where it is a flat earth but except it's
26:36 just a town instead of the whole world
26:38 and you're now in ed Harris's little
26:43 room which is the moon and you can go
26:47 outside and see the city outside and see
26:50 this you know again this dome
26:52 the ground and then you know you think
26:56 of like West world West world sorta has
26:58 a flat earth island a disc of an island
27:02 where all these little parks are of
27:04 course West world's the one that we saw
27:05 first there's going to be different
27:07 zones if they carry the book and the
27:10 initial movie through but I think about
27:13 okay so you're on the outside looking in
27:15 now and what would you feel would you
27:20 feel like let's just say you live 40
27:22 years of your life inside this earthdome
27:26 and you've swallowed it because of
27:29 course you would like everybody did less
27:32 you're told it's a ramp ball and you're
27:33 told that we have things in orbit and
27:35 that that did that but let's just say it
27:37 never happened it was all just a cabal
27:40 the people that you call Jesuits well
27:43 what's so strange about them they're
27:45 priests that don't want you to believe
27:47 in God and just think that's really
27:48 funny but okay let's just say they
27:51 weren't really priests they weren't
27:52 really necessarily an earthly secret
27:56 society they were actually the Ed Harris
27:58 secret society they were the dome owners
28:01 just trying to keep you from noticing by
28:05 selling you this fiction why can they
28:09 get a lot of people on board because
28:10 that's the story they're like hey you
28:12 know what we're in this container and
28:15 it's better that man doesn't find out
28:18 that we're in the container because if
28:20 they do then they're gonna feel like you
28:21 know the their captured it's going to
28:26 destroy society over time so we need to
28:29 make you know we need to fund space
28:31 program space sci-fi television shows
28:34 movies we need to get a bunch of neil
28:36 bill nye the douchebag guys to act out
28:40 all this stuff and the place is getting
28:43 a little were populated based on our
28:45 resources that were willing to allocate
28:46 for the domes so we need to have a bunch
28:48 of depopulation stuff so we've got this
28:50 little program agenda21 we're gonna kind
28:53 of reset things a little while that'll
28:54 give us a whole whole nother bag and
28:56 once everybody's dead that the remaining
28:59 150 million people that are alive
29:00 they're gonna love life they don't know
29:02 it yet they're gonna love it we're going
29:03 to really control them
29:04 and put it you know surveillance on it
29:07 was like okay I'm part of the part of
29:08 the gang right but now imagine you were
29:11 popped out there's a few Star Trek
29:14 episodes like this where the they
29:16 accidentally break the prime directive
29:18 and take people from the surface of
29:21 their primitive planet up into the
29:23 enterprise and they look around they're
29:26 like oh my god this is amazing they look
29:27 down on their planet you know these
29:29 people haven't really discovered fire
29:32 yet and they're looking out of a
29:33 spaceship now you come out of the dome
29:37 and you see what it's made out of
29:39 there's no God on the other side like
29:43 just right there you know whatever that
29:45 would look like it's not water it's a
29:48 container and we have owners and they
29:52 like they're exactly like us
29:53 biologically not exactly but same sort
29:55 of humanoid thing I mean maybe it is a
29:59 it is a big Truman show where they're
30:02 just shooting movies of our wars and all
30:05 this other stuff
30:06 I mean Q if anything has proved that we
30:08 live in a movie kind of a wag the dog
30:10 situation but now they say okay you know
30:14 we really need you to go back inside the
30:16 dome because you can't really exist out
30:17 here because you're really not
30:18 compatible with us you know we're
30:22 millions of years ahead of you and
30:24 technology you're gonna feel much more
30:26 comfortable in your own skin it's just
30:28 like those episodes of Star Trek will
30:30 they send the person back down to the
30:31 planet that they came from and you kind
30:34 of you know you're happy as a viewer of
30:37 Star Trek especially to see that occur
30:39 because you always want to see someone's
30:40 mind blown when they see a big
30:42 differential and technology but in the
30:44 end would they be able to accept their
30:47 old world again don't know my perception
30:53 of reality as it relates to potentially
30:55 a matrix is that yeah it's so easy to
31:00 believe that all of this is a computer
31:02 simulation the my perception of mass and
31:05 energy and my body you it's a real
31:11 running simulation and boy is it well
31:15 written code if it is
31:17 it's well written code no matter what
31:20 but but my perception of 3d is no
31:23 different than the linear plane of
31:26 memory in a computer that can simulate
31:30 right through you know these
31:33 transformation matrix algorithms that
31:36 can take two-dimensional information and
31:39 projected in the three-dimensional
31:40 manner which is weird video games and 3d
31:43 rendering software it's not real but
31:46 damn if you can tell the difference the
31:49 UFO that lands at the beginning of this
31:51 show I made it in my computer sure looks
31:55 real if I had more time and money I
31:58 could make it look photo real damn
32:00 things in 4k you know it's awesome
32:03 our ego is a very weird thing the fact
32:11 that we need one I think is very strange
32:14 because I think it dictates the
32:17 paradigms that we invent to exist I
32:21 think we like feeling important even if
32:24 we're not willing to admit it because we
32:26 are aware of our surroundings and
32:28 anybody was talking you know all day
32:30 long about how important they were you
32:32 wouldn't hang out with them much and I
32:33 think most people know that so you don't
32:36 do it but deep down inside you want to
32:39 feel important as maybe a group we went
32:42 to the moon why because we did and that
32:46 makes me feel good as a man as a man
32:48 kind human Homo Sapien rate house do we
32:53 not think where there's the whole
32:56 category of man's inability to deal with
32:59 the unknown that's a bit of a problem
33:03 so we pretend to know everything and
33:07 it's a temporary button on the unknown
33:11 and I have to say I'm all for it I'm all
33:15 for us coming up with things that can
33:18 give us a little solace a little solid
33:21 you know ground for our footing I
33:24 wouldn't want to go to bed at night and
33:26 open my door to my bedroom and then it's
33:28 just a bottomless pit
33:30 of nothing and maybe it's cold you know
33:34 it's like you just hop in that room and
33:36 then you I don't know you float you sink
33:39 you drop all night long and then
33:42 hopefully you wake up and you're
33:43 standing up again so I like I like
33:47 reality I like generally the reality
33:50 that we've created in terms of its
33:51 substance obviously I'd like us to be a
33:54 lot more intelligent and get along a lot
33:57 better
33:58 here's another concept for you isn't it
34:01 bizarre that we go to bed at night and
34:05 we lie down and when we dream several
34:10 times in our dreams we walk we are
34:13 upright in our dreams and you might just
34:17 blow that off and go well of course we
34:19 walked all day long and so of course
34:21 we'd be walking when we're in our dreams
34:25 because we're recreating the reality
34:26 that we just had access to don't we sit
34:30 sit we stand we lie down those of you
34:38 I'm sure almost all of us have had this
34:40 have done unequivocally all of this but
34:42 you know I've had dreams where I'm
34:43 floating horizontally I don't see my
34:47 body but I feel like I'm horizontal and
34:50 I'm floating around some scenario and
34:52 I'm seeing things and that's where you
34:54 don't really have control you're so like
34:56 the car inside the amusement ride right
34:58 I often wonder and here's a more
35:02 abstract one the whole paradigm of I'm
35:08 gonna make a comparison between two
35:10 different things if I were to say to a
35:12 lot of you time doesn't exist it is
35:16 merely illusion of change and because we
35:20 have memory we remember change I'm a ham
35:24 was here now it's here that's time boom
35:26 boom so relative to our current state of
35:30 being there is time because there's
35:34 change now let's think about counting
35:39 you know what if you got up there and
35:41 you minute God you go
35:43 how high have you counted God and God
35:47 says well there's no such thing as
35:50 counting there's no such thing as
35:53 numbers quantification things just are
35:58 but when you were in that human body and
36:01 you couldn't go anywhere in the universe
36:03 that you wanted to and be at anytime you
36:06 wanted to counting was a way for you to
36:11 understand your existence but then you
36:15 say but God I've got five fingers on
36:16 this hand and five fingers on that and
36:18 five toes and five toes two eyes one
36:23 mouth no big God says look I didn't
36:26 design you with ten toes and fingers I
36:30 just gave you something that could grip
36:33 something perfectly didn't think about
36:37 the numbers then you've met a being that
36:40 doesn't count but lives perfectly in a
36:44 world that can create things hmmm
36:48 so could you come back to your world
36:50 with that beautiful conversation with
36:52 God and live in a world without counting
36:55 anything well I need some money well
36:59 let's put more money in the bank how
37:01 much I don't know just more this person
37:03 needs more than I have right now so how
37:07 do I get more stuff in the bank huh go
37:10 do a job okay I'll do some work there
37:11 have some stuff in there did you put
37:13 some stuff in there yeah I don't care
37:15 how much it is but I'm looking to
37:17 everyone else going did you get as much
37:19 as you needed in your bank you know
37:21 whatever your visa cards like I got as
37:22 much as I needed in your electric
37:24 companies I got as much as I need so
37:26 you're not counting any more necessarily
37:27 just getting resources and putting them
37:30 places what is important to man is
37:34 usually related to man's survival and
37:36 that has to be that way we need food and
37:40 shelter the two most basic things once
37:44 that allows us to gain a little bit of
37:46 time with our brain we start to develop
37:49 intellectually and then we decide we
37:53 need a little bit more
37:55 definitely feel lonely we feel delighted
37:59 to be with someone once you hold another
38:02 human being you find out that our
38:04 designers put all kinds of beautiful
38:06 things for when you can hold another
38:08 being to your chest and they want you to
38:12 do the same and you're in love it's
38:15 interesting that love it's sort of like
38:19 we give you a weird analogy guns need
38:24 bullets and they need skills to operate
38:27 most lethal weapon in the world is a
38:29 knife a knife doesn't need much training
38:31 it's a hundred percent lethal hell just
38:34 cutting stuff in there in the kitchen
38:37 has been responsible for thousands if
38:39 not millions of people cutting a finger
38:41 off
38:42 that's how dangerous a knife is right so
38:46 something very simplistic about a sharp
38:48 edge well out of all the emotions that
38:52 we can manifest as human beings love is
38:54 the knife as it was a love cuts like a
38:58 knife yeah come on now but it's
39:01 something that is so basic to our being
39:04 and the more that we you know engage
39:09 animals and a domesticated manner boy
39:13 you can see he could have a pet anything
39:16 as long as it's braised from its little
39:19 puppy stage or whatever it's lamb brie
39:21 onyx stage once it's born and then you
39:24 raise it I mean people found bees and
39:27 raised them they found moths they found
39:30 all kinds of insects and these things
39:32 develop a relationship with you
39:34 tarantulas I've got friends with pet
39:36 tarantula
39:37 that act like dogs you know they played
39:40 hide-and-go-seek with the tarantula it's
39:42 tremendous everything has this love
39:46 algorithm in it it's not just instinct
39:49 but in a hostile situation of course
39:53 love has to be put aside because we have
39:56 to deal with that food and shelter thing
39:59 so there's definitely stages of the
40:02 brain on there's priority to the brain
40:05 which again is utterly brew
40:09 now evolutionists can definitely chime
40:11 in and say we'll see that's the way it
40:13 worked the only things that survived
40:14 with the things that figured out the
40:16 first two things which would probably be
40:19 you know some creature that
40:22 serendipitously had a food supply and
40:25 had a shelter which knows the whole
40:27 chicken and egg thing about well who's
40:28 the smallest food supply and how the
40:30 hell did that thing start in the first
40:31 place right
40:33 there's an interesting channel on
40:35 YouTube it's called like the octopus lab
40:37 and it's this family that owns an
40:40 octopus and they have a really large
40:42 tank that's like 50 75 gallon tank or
40:46 something like that this octopus is
40:47 pretty big it's about the size of a
40:49 basketball if it fully stretches out and
40:54 they do interesting experiments with
40:57 this thing and one of the experiments
40:59 was that it lived inside this little
41:00 barrel which is probably I don't know
41:04 maybe 10 inches deep and maybe six or
41:08 seven inches wide looks like a Cracker
41:10 Barrel barrel you know it was just lived
41:14 in there and so they they'll take it out
41:16 and I guess put it in another container
41:19 and then they mess with its environment
41:21 and they put him back in and he or she
41:24 is engaging in experiments and they took
41:30 these little blocks and put them all
41:33 inside the barrel filling it up about
41:35 two-thirds but then they put this other
41:37 square box in there with sort of like a
41:39 place where he could hang out put it
41:42 back in the water and it looked at its
41:45 barrel and it's like crap what the
41:47 hell's going on here and looks over the
41:49 other thing and it ignores the secondary
41:52 place that's been added and it crawls in
41:54 because it's so you know malleable and
41:57 its shape it crawls in turns around puts
42:00 its butt in and then it starts to kind
42:02 of scoop the stuff up to create more of
42:04 a shield and then someone had the idea
42:06 of putting in four three two four on
42:09 white bathroom tiles and it when you see
42:15 it grab the tiles it starts to pull them
42:17 up and create a shelter starts to create
42:19 a door and close itself in
42:22 whoa remember an octopus's brain in a
42:27 super squid and a super octopus is 50
42:30 feet long it's brain is the size of your
42:34 pinky and it's a hollow tube now again
42:37 they say they're trying to come up with
42:39 other theories that neurons might exist
42:41 in the legs but you know you can cut a
42:43 leg off of one of these things and
42:44 they'll grow it back so hmm so if you
42:48 cut all of its legs off does it become
42:49 you know mentally [ __ ] and then it
42:52 goes little back and it becomes Einstein
42:53 again I mean I don't know I don't know
42:55 if I believe that they're all the
42:58 scientists in the world talking about
43:00 digitizing the human brain and putting
43:01 it inside of a computer
43:02 but of course they have chosen to ignore
43:06 the fact that we might have a soul we
43:08 probably do have a soul and that the
43:10 brain is merely just a proxy for the
43:13 output yes if you get brain damage you
43:17 seem you know like you've got problems
43:20 mentally you get a tumor in your brain
43:23 you become a serial killer you can
43:24 become a tomb of your brain and you
43:26 think you're ugly when you're beautiful
43:28 you think you're fat when you're thin
43:29 doesn't mean we don't have a soul it
43:31 just means you injured the mechanism
43:34 that the electricity is supposed to go
43:36 through which is your soul right your
43:39 soul being the power supply but now how
43:42 is kurtzweil and the singularity project
43:44 not thinking he's not for one second
43:49 ever mentioned but I've read the
43:53 existence of a soul I'm sure he would
43:56 think that that is for the superstitious
43:59 for those that are religious and you
44:02 know how can we blame the guy when he
44:04 crosses over the precipice of capital
44:07 science capital s science and he sees a
44:10 bunch of people worshiping Santa Claus
44:12 and he's like see you guys are just
44:15 completely out of touch with reality I
44:17 have the balls to get rid of all your
44:19 make-believe crap and study science what
44:24 I can observe and touch through the
44:26 paradigms of thinking invented by
44:29 scientists before me ignoring everyone
44:32 before Tesla and Tesla himself of course
44:36 but they call limited it is to have
44:41 these little sort of blockers in the
44:43 brain they can't think the full thought
44:47 I don't think any of us can quite
44:50 frankly but we can do tiny little things
44:54 to ourselves that will you know be
44:58 defined as enlightenment right
45:02 I used to say enlightenment is merely
45:04 defined as being able to see more okay
45:08 well that means less paradigm
45:10 restrictions what's interesting is as I
45:14 I don't think I've really ever met a
45:16 person who genuinely said I don't want
45:19 to be smart there's definitely people
45:22 that are like ignorance is bliss in this
45:25 particular area so I'd rather not know
45:27 because there may be fragile human
45:29 beings perhaps usually they've had sort
45:32 of a checkered childhood and seeing
45:34 certain things freaks them out or they
45:36 have an a vivid imagination and it's
45:39 usually triggered by something in their
45:40 past that takes I don't know a zombie
45:43 show on TV and it turns it into full
45:45 reality when they go back to their
45:46 bedroom even though they are sentient
45:48 adults that should know better okay well
45:52 it just happens I once I was trying to
45:55 what I did I had to take some medicine
45:57 once this is about ten years ago I think
46:01 and this was a very humbling experience
46:07 for me and let me know if you've ever
46:09 had this experience because I think this
46:11 was super powerful but I have been
46:15 driving cars and won't worry another
46:18 since I was seven my father used to let
46:21 me steer the car for miles and miles
46:23 like 30 mile trips at seven just sitting
46:26 in his lap he did the pedals but I was
46:29 driving you know licensed by 14 and you
46:33 know I in Kansas you can have a full
46:36 driver's license at 16 so I was all over
46:38 the state by 16 and you know and I went
46:41 and I got such such a good driving
46:43 capability that when I came to
46:44 California work for Jim Hall racing and
46:48 so on and so forth reason why I say that
46:50 is that I have a very proficient method
46:56 of driving I actually created a little a
46:59 little book on how to avoid California
47:02 Highway Patrol when I lived in the Bay
47:04 Area cuz boy they're just nasty up there
47:06 they're like Ohio
47:08 you know 56 and you get a ticket
47:10 apparently you have nothing else better
47:12 to do
47:13 Southern California not like that at all
47:15 cops down here so cool he could be going
47:18 you know 17 255 and Kapil just passed
47:21 you don't even care about you but anyway
47:23 I took some medicine then I had to drive
47:27 home or drive from point A to point B in
47:30 my car and whatever was in this medicine
47:34 made me feel really how do I what's the
47:42 word I would use I guess I could use
47:44 like the word frail or weak or it was
47:48 just that I got on the highway I
47:50 remember for the first and this is
47:52 probably the only time this has ever
47:54 occurred to me I felt very overwhelmed
47:57 by the traffic I felt very small inside
48:02 my car so this is most bizarre
48:05 experience right and I remember
48:08 immediately noticing I was having this
48:10 emotion and I was thinking wow I don't
48:15 feel as confident doing this that's the
48:18 work probably confident doing this and
48:20 so I'm thinking wow if I stayed in the
48:23 slow lane the whole time you know I was
48:24 cool and I wasn't driving out of the
48:27 speed limit or anything like that but I
48:28 just imagined wow what if some young kid
48:32 I was you know I was because at least 10
48:35 years younger maybe in 10 to 15 years
48:36 ago I can't remember but you know some
48:39 younger kid comes by going you know what
48:41 are you doing driving so slow get out of
48:42 my way down it up and being impatient
48:44 with my sudden I wouldn't say fear but
48:49 it was right on the precipice of
48:51 probably even fear of driving my car
48:53 because this medicine that was freaking
48:55 me out it made me feel sort of uneasy I
48:57 can't remember what the hell it was
49:00 but now like you know 24 hours passes
49:04 that goes away I never had the feeling
49:06 again but now I'm driving in my car and
49:09 I'm looking at other drivers having a
49:12 problem driving because you know you
49:14 have we have a lot of fresh off the boat
49:16 immigrants that have never driven in
49:18 their life they're getting their first
49:19 driver's license at 55 years old they
49:21 suck at driving I mean who the hell
49:23 could it just blows my mind that anyone
49:25 could learn such a complicated art of
49:28 driving at such a late age but it
49:30 happens and so we obviously have to be
49:33 intellectual enough to have patience for
49:35 people that don't know how to drive that
49:38 well and the two main ones that we went
49:40 into all around the world is young
49:41 people who are learning how to drive and
49:43 older people that are losing their their
49:46 acuity and so they start driving slower
49:48 because they know their brain isn't
49:50 functioning as quick as it did when they
49:51 were in their 40s let's say and so we
49:54 have to have patience when you see an
49:56 old person in a car driving real slow
49:58 that's par for the course when I I was
50:01 driving home the other day from lunch
50:02 and I came up on a thing I told the
50:06 story in some recent episode but it was
50:09 some kid in his driver's training car
50:13 and she was trying to turn a corner and
50:18 she did the old the classic mistake we
50:20 all make at the beginning which is to
50:21 break through the turn well what happens
50:24 eventually you stopped the car right you
50:27 gotta accelerate through the turn brake
50:28 up to the turn accelerate through it and
50:31 I'm sure the driver was given you know
50:32 the teacher was given her the the proper
50:35 advice and so she had literally come to
50:38 a stop in the middle of the apex of the
50:40 turn and it's a residential road so
50:43 there's no cars around so I just gonna
50:45 you know beamed around her but I knew
50:47 not to you know hot rod around her cuz
50:51 that might freak her out even more and I
50:52 don't want to set her back in her
50:54 education of how to drive a car but just
50:56 understanding each other's plates is
50:59 something that we don't do intentionally
51:03 enough I guess right if you're a person
51:06 that does that on a routine basis you
51:08 really empathetically live through other
51:10 people's experiences than you are
51:14 a quality person that we need more of in
51:16 this world so have kids would you but
51:19 then let's talk about how we don't think
51:24 because obviously the opposite is how we
51:26 do think now I've touched on this sort
51:30 of path a few times but I wanted to for
51:35 especially for you early parents I know
51:37 some of our a lot of our listeners and
51:41 moderators are parents and so you get to
51:45 have this wild experiment right we need
51:48 our parent well sorry we need our kids
51:50 to have paradigms of understanding so
51:54 that they can exist in this world and
51:57 not eat it right not be suffer from the
52:00 world's slings and arrows right but
52:05 here's the trick the real trick is
52:08 trying to keep your kids bind open at
52:10 the same time it's closing for every
52:14 time we learned a paradigm if the
52:18 precursor to the paradigms education is
52:21 well in order to get this sort of thing
52:23 accomplished with other human beings as
52:26 we currently understand it this is a
52:29 method of which you can do it and then
52:33 the bumper on the end is however you
52:36 might figure out a better way to do this
52:38 by doing it completely different than
52:40 this method we know that there's the old
52:44 saying there's several ways to skin a
52:45 cat which is atrocious thinking but the
52:50 idea is there are several ways to do a
52:51 particular thing look at f1 race cars
52:55 well they all accomplished the race car
52:58 a different way if they accomplished it
53:00 the same way Mercedes and Ferrari
53:02 wouldn't win every goddamn race right
53:04 that's why I like your stopping I mean
53:07 he just kicks all their asses from Red
53:09 Bull but do we keep the door open for
53:13 kids brains I don't think we do I've
53:16 told you guys the story a couple times
53:18 when I was in physics class and my
53:20 teacher starts laying down a e equals
53:22 mc-squared and I had already spent damn
53:24 near half a decade in that
53:26 as a nauseating level and without any
53:31 internet without any skepticism books or
53:34 conspiracy books I felt it was [ __ ]
53:38 but he has to teach the class he's
53:40 responsible for sending us home with
53:43 this theory from this plagiarist called
53:46 Einstein and so I raised my hand after
53:50 he explained and I said look because he
53:52 gets down to the point where light can't
53:54 travel I'm sorry that mass can't travel
53:56 fasteners be light and so I said well
53:59 what if it can what I would have loved
54:02 for him to do but this was only the 80s
54:04 and without a lot of beautiful
54:07 information and in other forms of
54:08 thinking available to him he got angry
54:11 with me he just kind of said something
54:15 to the effect of well I can't be talking
54:20 about that we can't go there right now
54:21 you know like this is that we don't have
54:22 anything to tell you about that right I
54:25 would have loved for him to say well
54:27 let's finish this theory and then let's
54:30 explore your theory because in my book
54:33 if you really understand a particular
54:35 form of science or craft or something
54:39 then you're able to invent you know but
54:44 there's also this very strange thing let
54:46 me give you a gödel Escher box sort of
54:48 thought process here I learn music by
54:53 writing programs to play music and so I
54:59 desperately wanted a keyboard at 14
55:02 didn't know what a buy one didn't have
55:04 any money
55:05 and so I took my computer and I
55:07 programmed I wouldn't say a synthesizer
55:12 because I couldn't change necessarily
55:14 the waveform sound it had its own little
55:16 music generator in it but I would type
55:18 in the notes the rests
55:20 you know half notes quarter notes
55:22 whatever and had to play music back to
55:25 me okay that got me going then I saved
55:27 up a ton of money and went to Wichita
55:30 Kansas and bought my first keyboard and
55:32 then I started buying and buying buying
55:34 stuff so what ends up happening is I
55:37 don't have any formal training
55:39 I'm listening to Prince I'm listening to
55:42 everything that's out there John char
55:43 and I'm learning how to do voice leading
55:47 I'm learning how the structures of songs
55:49 work I mean just listen to a song and
55:51 copy it on your keyboard and you'll
55:52 learn that there's this you know the
55:55 magic repetition of for usually creates
55:59 any takes any random notes and turns it
56:01 into a song then I got to California and
56:05 I got to a music studio and I started
56:06 laying down tracks of my own creation
56:08 and then I bump into this woman who I
56:14 don't know exactly where she played but
56:16 she was this famous artist old she was
56:19 famous pianist in LA could have been the
56:21 Philharmonic or something like that I
56:23 don't know how much piano playing they
56:24 deal with that but she was famous for
56:26 doing this stuff really nice woman and
56:30 she was in the room and I didn't know
56:32 she was there and I was playing on the
56:34 piano at my girlfriend's house at the
56:36 time and I'm playing all my stuff right
56:39 and she stepped behind me and she goes
56:42 what is that and I said you know it's
56:45 just some stuff I've been writing and
56:47 I'm recording in this studio and then
56:49 she said man I wish I could do that
56:52 I'm like what I said well aren't you the
56:56 woman that plays the piano yeah oh yeah
56:58 yeah and I said well don't you know like
57:00 hundreds of songs oh yeah totally yeah I
57:03 said well how is it that you can play
57:07 the most difficult music ever written by
57:10 the classical masters and you can read
57:12 sheet music fluently okay but you can't
57:16 stop for one second and just piece
57:18 together the stuff on your own just let
57:20 it go man just touch the keys and feel
57:22 it and and maybe it's a very simple
57:25 little riff maybe it's a really complex
57:27 collection of riffs that create a some
57:30 sort of beautiful symphony or something
57:32 but why couldn't she and it would be a
57:36 complete oxymoron for the brain to hear
57:39 the reason why she couldn't do it
57:41 because she learned to play the piano
57:45 she got recital after recital after
57:48 recital until she learned how to
57:50 replicate other people's music
57:51 but that creative gene in her
57:54 I guess was never afforded any time to
57:57 sit there and just tinker because I
57:59 guess maybe as a child she had so much
58:02 pressure on her to get her recital
58:04 together no no no no no no it's like
58:07 great you can play this thing that
58:08 everyone knows how to play and I just
58:10 chill out and just I don't know look out
58:14 the window man I had this I just wrote
58:17 live at the studio once and my
58:21 girlfriend came with me and I'm here I'm
58:25 totally in love with this girl and we
58:28 were supposed to get married and all
58:29 this other stuff I think I was like 20
58:31 years old she was 18 and she was tired
58:36 and so the studio had a sofa just about
58:40 ten feet away from me I'm on this Yamaha
58:43 dx7 and I'm and it's raining outside and
58:49 it's just this little ballad you know
58:52 that's so you know I just took up the
58:54 software hit record and I'm just playing
58:55 this ballot and I'm just looking at this
58:57 woman I love more than life itself the
59:00 rain is outside just a pitter pattering
59:02 rain the door was open it was warm out
59:04 and I'm just letting the whole thing
59:06 flow through me as I'm writing this song
59:08 that I've never heard before there are
59:11 so many things like this where when you
59:15 let go the universe comes through you
59:19 these sound engineers that you know work
59:21 for people like Prince you listen to
59:24 their interviews separate interviews
59:26 because he would work 24 hours he would
59:29 complete almost every single song that
59:32 he ever wrote in one day and the woman
59:35 that worked with him on propyl rein said
59:37 look he was at sunset studios here in LA
59:42 and she said you know she just made
59:45 windows cry I'm one day of course he had
59:48 thought about it before he got his court
59:50 progressions down but by the time he
59:53 committed to making it he just would
59:55 never stop and then the next day he just
59:57 lays down let's go crazy all at once
60:00 nuts but the one thing she said that
60:03 really kicked it off for me was
60:06 it just seemed like music flowed through
60:08 him he could hear it a hundred percent
60:11 in his brain and then he would toil and
60:14 work hard in the studio to get it out
60:17 the way that he was hearing it and you
60:21 know there's the scene in Indiana Jones
60:24 3 where they're stuck in this tower and
60:27 the Nazis are coming up to kill him it's
60:30 Indiana Jones which is obviously
60:32 Harrison Ford and Sean Connery and he's
60:35 like you know we gotta get out of here
60:36 we're gonna get out and he's like his
60:38 father goes well you know what I find is
60:41 it when I sit down and just relax my
60:43 mind the answer comes to me and he's
60:47 like great dad dude that's really gonna
60:48 help us out and then Sean Connery sits
60:50 in a chair and leans back and it hits a
60:52 lever and the staircase forms and they
60:55 leave right it's a bit of a
60:57 tongue-in-cheek interpretation of that
61:01 analogy but that's it you just relax
61:06 one thing I've done on this show since
61:08 the very beginning is that I look at
61:12 where we have friction points in society
61:16 where I had friction points growing up
61:18 through I mean in you know you're never
61:21 done growing up so it happens forever
61:24 but I see people making foolish mistakes
61:27 that are easily avoidable if that human
61:31 being would simply have a conversation
61:33 with another human being about the
61:35 subject but we're so I don't know we're
61:38 so full of [ __ ] in this world you know
61:41 just look at the posts on Facebook or
61:44 Instagram or people trying to prove they
61:46 live a better life than they do that's
61:48 what we do it's some weird thing like it
61:52 probably has to do with natural
61:53 selection regardless if we admit it we
61:56 want to be with other people in an
61:59 intimate way some people just want sex
62:01 some people want the relationships some
62:03 people want both sometimes it's 50/50
62:07 sometimes it's 8020 2080 whatever but if
62:11 you seem broken to the world
62:12 and confused and you're making mistakes
62:15 well we don't allow that you know
62:19 so the solution well just hunker down by
62:22 yourself and try to figure it all out
62:25 hopefully that works you know I've made
62:28 hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
62:30 videos trying to recall and illustrate
62:36 my own journey and then sort of like all
62:40 the stupid mistakes I've made cos boy I
62:42 think I I think I have a pretty good
62:44 record with the amount of failures I've
62:47 had in life in order to achieve any
62:49 success in life and you'll see these
62:52 CEOs and some educators get credit for
62:57 it but they'll write books about how
63:00 failure is the greatest thing you can
63:01 experience in life because it makes you
63:04 more resilient it lets you not lose your
63:08 mind when you succeed or when you scuse
63:10 me when you fail right you fail and
63:11 you're like oh my god I'm broken and no
63:14 this is this one little moment in time
63:16 is gonna be a state that I'm stuck in
63:18 for the rest of my life hmm how do we
63:23 not think well we are not willing to
63:26 give failure some some value in our life
63:30 that's one of the basic things that man
63:32 has it figured out as a whole right I
63:36 mentioned a long time ago I'm probably
63:40 three or four years ago now that you
63:43 know I have relatives in mind that
63:44 believe completely different things than
63:46 I believe and what's interesting is you
63:51 know when you look at you know events in
63:54 2001 September when you look at
63:57 Kennedy's assassination or other things
64:00 of similar nature and you look at it and
64:04 you can see the conspiracy you can see
64:07 the [ __ ] you know high school
64:10 physics enough to know that that day in
64:13 September it could not have occurred
64:15 based on any explanation that you heard
64:17 let's say you see it and you're like
64:20 okay all I need to do is take any
64:22 non-believer and show them a book in
64:24 physics over here and then roll the
64:26 footage over here and go see that this
64:29 right here it's negated by this over
64:31 here
64:32 and we could sit in a laboratory all day
64:34 long and you could try to create that
64:35 thing you saw on TV with any type of
64:38 physical model we can run the most
64:39 sophisticated engineering software in
64:42 the world and that will never occur over
64:43 there but in their brain they come back
64:47 with the official story and you're like
64:50 what the hell is wrong with you
64:52 why can't you just put two and two
64:53 together why are we debating whether or
64:55 not we went to the moon it's absolutely
64:57 impossible at this current state at
64:59 least it may be impossible forever
65:02 okay maybe something we really don't
65:06 consider is that multiverse anecdote is
65:12 that we all do live in our own universe
65:15 and my universe that doesn't work and
65:20 their universe it works perfectly when
65:23 they look at it and maybe they look at
65:25 the physics book and I'm seeing this
65:27 equation in one way and in their mind
65:29 they see a completely different equation
65:31 I look at the news footage of that day
65:34 and I see a hundred ten story building
65:37 falling in about six and a half seconds
65:39 I look up my book it's impossible but
65:43 they see it falling for a minute you
65:46 know they see everything but then in
65:49 their brain if I see okay let's just
65:53 let's just come down to brass tacks here
65:55 how many seconds do you see that
65:57 building falling and they open their
66:00 mouths and their universe they're saying
66:02 I don't know 60 seconds and my universe
66:05 they're saying six and a half seconds
66:07 all right and so were we're even taking
66:13 what people say and we're interpreting
66:14 into our own world and I'll give you a
66:18 really weird example and I've said this
66:20 one time before have you ever had that
66:23 morning or evening and you put your best
66:30 clothes on you took a shower you got all
66:32 cleaned up your hair looks great
66:34 your skin's good whatever it is that
66:37 makes you feel comfortable with yourself
66:38 you are rocking you look in the mirror
66:41 man you look tight and you're like you
66:45 don't I'm going to
66:46 I'm gonna take a picture myself to
66:48 remember this day maybe even post it on
66:51 social media so you get up there and you
66:53 snap the shot of yourself and you look
66:57 like [ __ ] in your photograph you're like
67:00 what the hell's wrong here hmm maybe
67:05 through the digital rasterization of
67:07 your appearance maybe the camera is
67:10 correct and the mirror because it's more
67:13 alive data your brain is changing the
67:16 mirror to make you feel better about
67:18 yourself because we need that to go out
67:21 and operate in society and what if
67:23 you're dressing up you're a young single
67:25 woman or young single man and tonight
67:27 you're gonna go try to find that special
67:30 person so you need to feel good about
67:32 yourself because you can carry yourself
67:34 well you'd have some charisma and charm
67:37 right I heard Lichtenstein has a lot of
67:40 charm did you look at your camera and
67:46 it's like damn what the hell's going on
67:47 because your camera has taken a snapshot
67:50 of reality saved it in a phone even
67:53 though you can view it it's not a live
67:55 reflection of who you are such as your
67:57 brain can toy with the image hmm you
68:02 ever meet someone you go to a job
68:06 interview you meet someone new and you
68:09 feel like you kicked it out of the park
68:11 you're like man they really this
68:15 conversation went great and you find out
68:17 later they thought it went completely
68:19 wrong
68:20 and there was just something about your
68:22 frequency that maybe reminded them of
68:25 someone else with that frequency who was
68:27 not so nice and so even though you were
68:30 being nice they saw something completely
68:34 different off of you you know if you're
68:36 a man talking to a woman maybe they're
68:40 seeing an evil brother an evil father
68:43 stepfather but you're not really that
68:46 person and you're really not doing
68:47 anything that they did but because you
68:49 may be where their cologne you sound
68:53 like them you make a gesture you have an
68:56 idio secrecy about you that they
68:59 they map you to something else that
69:01 you're not so as you live your life from
69:05 this point forward let's do a little
69:07 infinite homework here I want you to ask
69:11 yourself every once in a while how
69:14 you're not thinking or how the world is
69:17 in thinking do a psychological
69:20 experiment and do a sociological
69:22 experiment with this idea try to look at
69:25 things a different way how we not
69:29 dressing how we not making music how are
69:31 we not conversating with each other
69:32 and is there something better maybe
69:37 there's not was there something more
69:40 interesting
69:41 think about how every trend did Vince
69:43 itself
69:45 well we didn't dress like we did in the
69:48 40s before we had the 40's same with the
69:50 50s the 60s 70s we seem to have lost
69:54 such a gigantic portion of creativity in
69:57 this world that we're starting to suffer
70:00 artistically and for anyone who may have
70:05 and I doubt it's any of you but you know
70:07 if you're over 40 you've definitely
70:09 experienced this most likely when they
70:12 defunded the Arts in America which was a
70:16 very long process it was definitely
70:18 probably a 20-year process the defunded
70:21 mathematics to help the mind develop
70:23 logical thinking you kind of thought
70:26 about it and you thought well this is
70:28 probably going to hurt us but I wonder
70:30 how it's going to manifest itself how is
70:33 it going to be visible later and obvious
70:36 at a later point that we did to fund
70:39 defund the arts and we are living in the
70:44 absolute cesspool of the effect of those
70:51 changes right we got more classes
70:54 teaching you how to be a transvestite
70:55 and to deny your biological physiology
70:59 than we do teaching you how to you know
71:02 think mathematically or how to pick up
71:04 an instrument and write your own song to
71:07 grab paint and paint something that's
71:11 either photo real
71:13 or something far more creative which
71:15 might be a Picasso or a Jackson Pollock
71:20 or a dolly
71:21 you know dolly is one of my favorite
71:24 artists of all time because he he took
71:28 the literal rendering abilities that he
71:32 had which were photo real and he took
71:37 the surrealism of the human condition
71:40 the deep deep subconscious thoughts of
71:44 man and manifest them into paintings
71:47 there's the and I I could stare at his
71:52 name and I'd barely be able to pronounce
71:53 it but there's the Mexican filmmaker who
71:57 tried to make dune back in the 70s
72:00 there's an awesome movie on him if you
72:02 let's just look up dune 1970s you'll
72:06 find this project and he he really
72:09 caught Mobius and put him in the film
72:11 business he took took HR Giger and put
72:13 him in the film business and a bunch of
72:15 other folks he was never able to get the
72:18 film made but I recently sat with a
72:22 colleague of mine in the writing
72:24 business and mentioned this guy and he
72:29 said well what he created was complete
72:32 rubbish because I saw his first two
72:36 films and they were just junk so he was
72:39 like I'm glad he didn't make Dhoom now
72:42 the real backstory with this guy is that
72:45 he was so imaginative and so amazing of
72:47 course he hired the best town on planet
72:48 earth at the time and Mobius is
72:51 responsible for a gigantic part of this
72:53 as well if not the overwhelming majority
72:55 but he did work very closely with this
72:57 guy and this dude was just a visionary
72:59 man his first two movies were very
73:04 esoteric at the same time they were
73:06 linear his visuals on a second film
73:10 which he had a ton of money to make are
73:12 the closest I've ever seen someone
73:15 render a movie that looks like you're on
73:18 acid which is exactly his goal he
73:22 actually said I wanted you to be able to
73:24 experience
73:25 without actually taking any his
73:30 storyboard that he paid mobius to draw
73:33 as well as a few other brilliant
73:35 designers as like eager and forget this
73:38 other guys named his spaceships he's a
73:41 British guy brilliant
73:43 it was so ripped off in Hollywood after
73:46 he turned it in that it is responsible
73:48 for several Steven Spielberg scenes it
73:53 was responsible for the scene in Indiana
73:58 Jones when they opened the Ark of the
73:59 Covenant at the first film and all those
74:02 you know the ghost spirits come out and
74:04 the guy's face melts and it goes through
74:07 all the chests of all of the Nazis and
74:10 then the two lovers are tied to a stake
74:12 and they're just keeping their eyes
74:14 closed looking around
74:15 that's his movie that's not that's the
74:17 Mexican guy's movie not Spielberg's
74:19 movie he just saw it in this book which
74:23 Hollywood make copies of and they just
74:26 poached it to death it was amazing and
74:31 it's sad that in this world those those
74:33 who are that creative because we don't
74:36 think like they do they don't get there
74:40 their heyday that they deserve I would
74:44 like to create a world where these
74:46 harmless geniuses get their day you know
74:50 because we're missing out on a lot of
74:52 artwork and a lot of inspiration and a
74:55 lot of enlightenment in my opinion
74:57 because we don't have those individuals
75:00 contributing at the rate we used to but
75:03 of course you know I have to be careful
75:06 about how I say this but you know you'll
75:09 hear me from time to time and I did a
75:10 whole episode on LSD you know there's
75:13 the unfortunate thing about LSD is that
75:15 there's no way safe there's no safe way
75:21 to get pure real LSD there you know if
75:26 you're buying stuff off the web or
75:28 getting it from somebody you don't know
75:30 you might be getting some really harsh
75:32 stuff that has nothing to do with LSD
75:34 that's gonna make you hallucinate for
75:36 sure and have a really
75:36 we're experienced but could kill you and
75:39 so I can never recommend someone go out
75:42 and get LSD but I've been privileged to
75:45 get it twice from a extremely reliable
75:48 source which is the Grateful Dead's
75:50 drummer's wife now from her directly but
75:54 from people who had access to her stash
75:56 and I had some mind-blowing experiences
76:00 effect I did three trips on this stuff
76:02 but you know we know that people have
76:05 been eating mushrooms and all kinds of
76:06 psychedelics for years and having these
76:09 experiences and then becoming the
76:11 Oracles of their communities especially
76:15 the designers of sacred geometry
76:18 architecture cuz that's what you see you
76:23 understand things so much better and you
76:25 become such a peaceful version of a
76:29 human you know you do need to make sure
76:33 that you're not also I mean you should
76:36 watch my episode on LSD if you're close
76:38 to that experience just to make sure
76:39 you're ready for it my buddy vetted me
76:42 for four or five years before he said I
76:45 think you would be a great candidate to
76:47 take this because you don't have any
76:49 skeletons in your closet you really are
76:51 who you say you are and that kind of
76:54 thing and he was right I mean he was I
76:57 needed to have that vetting before I
76:59 took any stuff because if I was hiding a
77:01 bunch of demons that apparently brings
77:07 down all your barriers and then
77:09 whatever's in you comes out and so the
77:11 reason why people have what they call a
77:13 bad trip is because they shouldn't be
77:16 taking it in the first place and
77:18 typically my friends who have taken it
77:20 and say they'll never take it again
77:21 they have unfortunate childhoods and
77:26 really bad experiences so I understand
77:29 anyway I thought this episode would be
77:32 fun just to kind of jostle your brain
77:34 kind of get us off all the specifics of
77:37 life we need this kind of thing I mean
77:41 it's it's such a sad situation that we
77:43 don't have a community you know meetup
77:46 group where we can actually have these
77:48 conversations because the
77:50 probably very hard to police in the
77:51 first place we'd have to create some
77:53 sort of agenda where someone goes up and
77:56 speaks like I just spoke and they're the
77:58 center of the evening and then we break
78:01 apart and have the conversation about
78:02 what that person said because trying to
78:06 jam a bunch of people's brains and a
78:07 bunch of weird topics would just be hard
78:09 to heard as they say anyway give us some
78:14 thought and if you haven't been to deep
78:16 thoughts radio.com please go i'll make a
78:18 fairly short bumper today there's two
78:21 audio YouTube a bit shoot there's a
78:24 perfect link to the podcast for both
78:26 Android and the iOS there are three
78:31 social medias as of today there's
78:33 Facebook Twitter and mine's calm there's
78:36 two ways to contribute to the site
78:38 directly which is PayPal and patreon
78:41 there's two products if you download
78:42 them from the website supposedly there's
78:45 an affiliate to that which is the brief
78:46 browser and the Backblaze black backup
78:50 software you won't find any episode ones
78:52 on this particular channel because you
78:54 would move to another channel remember
78:56 this is a variety show let's say that so
78:58 people don't drop off you see an episode
79:00 you don't like just don't watch it
79:01 something else will come back around but
79:03 the website has over 400 and Jesus at
79:06 least 450 episodes so if you're new to
79:08 the channel there's plenty of stuff for
79:10 you to listen to plus a category list
79:12 and get you directly to what you want to
79:13 see if I am missing an episode that you
79:16 would love to hear please suggest it in
79:19 the comments section just know that if
79:21 you want me to read a book probably not
79:22 gonna happen if you want to watch a four
79:24 hour video you're gonna need to
79:25 paraphrase the video first before I'm
79:27 gonna jump in and you may need to be the
79:31 producer to get me to hop into the more
79:35 intense things but some of you have made
79:37 little tiny comments one sentence
79:39 comments that have turned in some of the
79:40 best episodes I've ever made so
79:42 definitely trust yourself the other
79:45 thing is if you think you're subscribed
79:46 to this channel on YouTube please make
79:48 sure you are if you're not on [ __ ]

80:01 same powers as YouTube there's an app
80:04 for your phone as well so click the bell
