00:00 [Music]
00:34 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:36 deep thoughts we are once again at the
00:39 smoke lounge
00:40 first place I can plug it in so you know
00:44 me I like to talk about the moon we
00:48 we've been getting a lot of spammers a
00:51 lot of I guess NASA sigh up employees
00:56 and these are you know they'll see on
01:01 the moon rock well they're a bunch of
01:02 C's they run around with this cut and
01:06 paste strategy of pasting just
01:09 absolutely mentally [ __ ] ill replies
01:14 to legitimate presentations of course
01:17 they haven't watched the video at all
01:19 it's probably some [ __ ] BOTS by
01:21 YouTube or some [ __ ] 5i Agency or
01:24 whatever but the beautiful thing is
01:26 we're keeping the pressure on they're
01:29 reacting we already get this Britannica
01:32 [ __ ] entry below every single video
01:36 that we put because of course they have
01:38 to indoctrinate you while you're hearing
01:41 the truth essentially above the playhead
01:45 is truth below the playhead is full
01:48 [ __ ] propaganda trying to lie to your
01:51 face about what happened from July was a
01:56 16 1969 all the way to the end of the 72
01:59 missions and so that's good we've got
02:03 him on the ropes we've got him over the
02:06 barrel and you know I think we should
02:10 make him squeal like a pig what do you
02:12 think so you know I'm always trying to
02:14 cover this and you know I've talked
02:16 about it at nauseam from some
02:17 perspectives so I sit at home and I'm
02:20 like damn you know they want more moon
02:22 missions stuff more moon hoax episodes
02:25 and so there's only so many new things
02:27 that are brewing I'm gonna talk to you
02:31 guys about some of the things I'm
02:32 researching I'm trying to go down more
02:35 into the granularity but I tell you what
02:38 they have definitely hired they're
02:40 hiring people okay out of the 60 million
02:43 dollars they [ __ ] us with every single
02:45 day wasting our money and this
02:47 absolutely useless space programs I mean
02:50 they're not yielding jack-shit for
02:52 society right if we had to say look
02:54 you're a private for-profit business now
02:57 we're the board of directors 350 million
02:59 people of America what are we gonna get
03:02 for our sixty million dollars a day
03:04 because we got a lot of [ __ ] ideas
03:06 we'd like to do it we'd like to pay off
03:07 all the shitty student loans out there
03:09 or at least pay for the attorney's fees
03:10 to sue the [ __ ] out of every university
03:12 that stole the kids monies for
03:14 unemployable degrees we'd like to spend
03:17 our money differently okay if they had
03:20 to come up with what we're getting out
03:21 of this it would be Jack [ __ ] [ __ ]
03:23 nothing at the at the maximum apex of
03:29 their guarantee to us they'd be able to
03:31 say well inspiration for children guess
03:35 what there was a lot of inspiration
03:36 before NASA existed that's how
03:38 everything came into existence prior to
03:41 NASA's existence so that's a lot of
03:42 horseshit there was more inspiration out
03:45 of the Hal 9000 in the 2001 a Space
03:47 Odyssey to stimulate coders to create
03:50 artificial intelligence than ever a real
03:53 computer that existed yet so we can get
03:56 inspired without wasting sixty million
03:59 dollars a day and if Trump really wants
04:00 to get serious with this needs to cut
04:02 them off and just cut them off with one
04:05 basic thing what you do has no value to
04:08 us
04:08 Morrow vers on mars fake [ __ ] CGI
04:11 Rovers on Mars what does that do for us
04:15 right what would we need to do if there
04:19 was a space emergency but there comes
04:20 the meteorite it's gonna [ __ ]
04:22 obliterate Earth and we have to get the
04:24 hell off this rock and in a sustainable
04:26 way that our DNA doesn't get chewed up
04:28 by radiation just leaving the Van Allen
04:30 belts ambient radiation from the Sun a
04:32 coronal mass ejection and then we need a
04:34 mechanism to get to a planet probably
04:40 outside of our solar system as far as
04:42 getting if ours is getting bombarded all
04:43 of a sudden it's mostly most likely not
04:46 a single Rock is probably bunch of [ __ ]
04:47 coming in so fleeing to Mars isn't
04:49 exactly the solution flying to the moon
04:51 isn't the solution we need full-blown
04:54 space travel faster than light
04:56 propulsion we need environmental systems
04:59 we need to be able to land on a rock
05:01 and terraform the thing but in the
05:03 meantime live within our own you know
05:06 ddy systems that we bring with us
05:10 they're not doing anything in that
05:12 territory as a matter of fact a lot of
05:14 that research could be accomplished on
05:16 earth before we ever get the Zefron
05:18 cochran work one right but what do we
05:22 get in these comments we get no specific
05:26 or specificity should I say about
05:29 anything that I've said in the videos
05:30 they just march in with this these cut
05:34 and paste things which are really funny
05:35 because it's just like I usually hide
05:38 from channel see you later dude I hope
05:40 all those calories that you converted
05:42 you know we're worth it because no one's
05:45 ever gonna see your [ __ ] comments
05:46 right we had a guy in there I think his
05:49 name was Vinny if your name is Vinny and
05:51 you didn't do this it's not you but some
05:54 guy with some other name but he came in
05:56 and he was harassing every single person
05:58 that made a comment supporting the fact
06:01 that it's a moon hoax and just simply
06:04 saying that he's an authority never
06:06 explaining [ __ ] calling people names but
06:09 in a sort of a way that I would allow it
06:11 I mean he's kind of like well you know I
06:12 don't think you're that smart or
06:13 whatever but he never furnished any
06:15 information to rebut anything the
06:19 problem is is the NASA is using our
06:21 money to pay employees to come up with
06:24 junk science cover-ups for every single
06:28 thing that they have been busted for
06:30 when it comes to the moon hoax and
06:33 they've created a pissing match where
06:35 there shouldn't be a pissing match the
06:37 fact that we as a society as a global
06:40 society especially through the Great
06:41 Awakening are waking up to the truth and
06:44 we're passing around truth and we're
06:46 undoing their [ __ ] lies and the fact
06:48 that our taxpayers dollars in every
06:50 country and the modern world it's being
06:53 consumed in part who knows what the real
06:56 budget is it's being consumed in part to
06:59 keep the lies going can you [ __ ]
07:02 imagine that right imagine that we
07:04 caught a bunch of pedophiles bunch of
07:07 Hollywood actors and a bunch of Catholic
07:09 priests and all these other [ __ ] nuts to
07:11 do this kind of stuff singers pop
07:13 singers
07:15 and we we actually apprehend them all
07:18 put them all in jail and then as some
07:21 matter of [ __ ] law we have to
07:24 actually pay to continue molesting kids
07:25 on their behalf right that's sort of how
07:28 insulting this whole thing is to our
07:31 hard-earned money which runs the country
07:34 so one of the definitions of trumps big
07:37 success if his big range in name of the
07:39 world and IQ and on all that stuff is
07:42 supposed to happen that what needs to
07:45 happen is that this has got to stop we
07:49 have to put in place constitutional
07:53 felonies okay
07:55 [ __ ] punishable by up to a maximum of
07:58 life in prison no capital punishment for
08:01 distributing propaganda but I don't
08:05 think that you know an average human
08:06 being making a video on YouTube is
08:08 construed as de facto truth but when
08:11 your government does it when the press
08:13 does it they have a whole doctrine of
08:17 journalism that they're supposed to
08:18 happen when you do scientific method
08:20 testing you get you're blind you're
08:22 double blind you know you're placebos
08:24 your regular indication stuff and
08:27 clinical studies for drugs or whatever
08:28 there's all kinds of scientific method
08:30 that is used to try to optimize the
08:32 indication but we know just like you
08:35 know Gallup polls all that [ __ ] can be
08:37 skewed to get what the [ __ ] you want out
08:39 of it right so this episode is going to
08:43 try and put forth a link that you can
08:46 give anyone on planet earth to say these
08:50 are the smoking guns of the best smoking
08:53 guns that we have right now a 20-19 in
08:55 my opinion about the moon hoax and again
08:59 they probably won't get through the
09:00 intro so you might have to fast-forward
09:01 it to like the moment that I start sees
09:03 these evidential pieces here but NASA
09:07 has absolutely unequivocally admitted
09:10 that we didn't go to the moon by various
09:12 other things that they've done the
09:15 astronauts that supposedly traveled in
09:17 this capsule all the way to the moon and
09:19 back have absolutely proven beyond the
09:21 shadow of a doubt that they did not go
09:23 to the moon because their stories don't
09:25 match the most intelligent people on
09:28 planet Earth that I have
09:28 ever talk to have figured this out 20 30
09:32 40 50 years ago some people never ever
09:34 believe that we went and some people
09:38 figured it out eventually
09:39 so where do we start boys isn't that
09:42 just a smorgasbord of good [ __ ] one of
09:45 the reasons why I want to do this
09:46 episode is that there are there are
09:48 areas where I just don't think we should
09:50 try to push the story because there are
09:53 too many variables in place that allow
09:55 the anti debunkers or I guess the hoax
09:59 debunkers to have leverage against us
10:02 right let me give you one of the areas I
10:05 think we should not be pushing even
10:06 though I do understand why they do it I
10:09 do think what we are seeing is is proof
10:12 and perhaps even a smoking gun it if you
10:15 have the IQ to process what you're
10:17 looking at the great smoking guns are
10:19 the ones where no one has to think it's
10:22 like oh yeah I guess you're right this
10:24 is all [ __ ] one of the first things
10:27 I think is very difficult for people to
10:30 understand are the converging shadows on
10:32 the moon here's why the surface of the
10:36 Moon is not flat and so the converging
10:39 shadow thing you can get a NASA employee
10:41 that we pay [ __ ] money for right out
10:44 of our tax dollars to construct this lie
10:46 that it's because of the crater shapes
10:49 and the Warped you know terrain as to
10:52 why shadows will be converging right so
10:54 one shadow is going straight out from
10:56 the camera if their sons to the back of
10:58 the camera which is always the case
11:00 because they don't want that damn stage
11:01 light in the [ __ ] original shot right
11:03 but the rock that's over to the right is
11:06 casting a shadow that's going to almost
11:07 be perpendicular to this to the rock
11:10 that's in front because it's got a
11:12 separate light off to the right and it's
11:15 really the problem that happens when you
11:17 try to take a warehouse and light the
11:19 whole thing there's all kinds of movies
11:22 out there where they had to light a full
11:25 stage and man there are tons of lights
11:27 and it gets super duper hot you know
11:30 when they were filming 2001 a Space
11:31 Odyssey the moon set that was almost had
11:36 no surface it was just a little bit of a
11:38 square or rectangle down when they went
11:40 down and talked you know went down to
11:42 touch the monolith that room was boiling
11:46 hot according to everybody who was there
11:47 and so they'd have to turn the lights on
11:50 shoot and then turn the lights off even
11:52 in the shining when they were filming
11:54 Jack typing in the typewriter they had
11:56 you know I think it was something like
12:00 eight hundred light bulbs in the room
12:02 that would turn on to like the whole
12:03 thing to be perfect and then they'd have
12:06 to turn it all off because the place was
12:08 sweltering hot so that's why there's
12:11 multiple light sources because that's
12:12 the way you light a room that supposed
12:16 to have sunlight I wouldn't go for that
12:18 let's dive in let's dive in let's not
12:20 mess around too much what the [ __ ] that
12:21 doesn't work the number one thing you
12:25 can put in front of anyone's face to
12:28 prove that we have never been to the
12:29 moon is Project Orion okay project Orion
12:34 was greenlit I think now three years ago
12:38 and it was a project where NASA said
12:42 look the Van Allen belts are these
12:43 electromagnetic belts that protect us
12:45 from all the coronal mass ejections from
12:47 the Sun plus a bunch of other debris
12:49 coming in from outside space and it
12:53 fends it off it vibrates it burns it
12:55 what-have-you and we've never again
12:58 you've never had a coronal mass ejection
12:59 happen on the on the planet Earth and
13:02 have a whole part of earth get scorched
13:06 so they've never failed us which means
13:09 they are extremely powerful so anybody
13:11 who tries to say that they're not
13:12 powerful
13:13 it's just absolutely absent in the
13:16 knowledge of how the Sun works how heat
13:21 comes to earth what our atmosphere is
13:23 capable of defending us against and what
13:25 the Van Allen belts do but what was
13:27 Project Orion's objective you can go
13:29 look this [ __ ] up go watch the [ __ ]
13:30 trailers on YouTube right their
13:33 objective was to put human flesh through
13:35 the Van Allen belts in a way that the
13:37 human didn't die that's NASA's mission
13:40 statement for that particular project
13:42 and it's a project that should be still
13:44 going to this day but it doesn't exist
13:46 anymore and why doesn't it exist well he
13:48 meant immediately announced to the
13:50 public that the first few missions are
13:52 going to be manless right
13:55 and so they're gonna put the put this
13:57 capsule up there see what the radiation
13:59 was internally to see what their ability
14:03 to shield radiation from the astronauts
14:05 aside all I can say is it must have been
14:08 so unbelievably lethal that when they
14:12 looked at the technology that we have in
14:14 the public domain that we're gonna allow
14:16 into the public domain and they have
14:18 radiation readings on the inside of this
14:20 place inside of this capsule it must
14:22 have been so lethal that they gave up
14:24 because they cancelled the project
14:26 either that or someone said who the [ __ ]
14:30 made this public project you just
14:32 admitted we didn't go to the moon who
14:34 left us through now bart sibrel director
14:38 of a funny thing happened on the way to
14:40 the moon and astronauts gone wild to
14:42 absolutely imperative documentaries that
14:45 you have to watch if you do if you still
14:46 think we went to the moon astronauts
14:49 gone wild again it was a periodic it was
14:51 a period name to make fun of you know
14:54 girls gone wild which was a big series
14:57 in 2003 and he just plagiarized that in
15:00 a funny way and made astronauts gone
15:02 wild but he called up NASA this is you
15:05 can hear him say this in the interview I
15:06 did with him
15:07 he called them NASA and asked them what
15:09 were the readings that you got from your
15:11 first mission and they said it's
15:13 classified what's classified NASA how
15:17 much radiation is coming from the Sun
15:18 how much radiation is coming from the
15:19 vanilla boats what's classified what's
15:22 the temperature of the Pacific Ocean at
15:23 this XYZ
15:24 it's classified well why is it
15:26 classified it's just water it's
15:28 ridiculous it's classified because it
15:30 proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that
15:32 they could not have made it to the moon
15:34 or ever left low orbit which today lower
15:38 orbits between 200 and 350 miles that's
15:41 it that is the only smoking gun on earth
15:45 you need to prove we never went to the
15:47 moon and that's why a smoking gun as a
15:49 smoking gun once you've got this one
15:51 thing you don't get to keep your history
15:53 anymore and I want you guys to start
15:54 saying that you know the whole ER Harvey
15:58 Oswald thing once you punch a hole in it
16:00 you don't get to keep your history
16:02 anymore you just don't second you find
16:05 the bullet holes that went through the
16:07 windshield
16:08 from the
16:09 front to the back in Kennedy's car in
16:13 Dallas that's a smoking gun you can't
16:15 keep your history once you see the
16:17 bullet that lodged into the chrome
16:19 molding that goes around the windshield
16:21 from the front to the back didn't go
16:24 through but it punched on the front you
16:27 don't get to keep your history anymore
16:28 that's what a smoking gun is here's the
16:31 other great smoking gun that I just
16:33 figured out this will go on my next moon
16:35 hoax evidence episode and you're gonna
16:38 hear this come up in other episodes
16:40 maybe even prior to this well in fact
16:42 the one I'm gonna do next will actually
16:44 preview this so this will be a double up
16:45 but no one's gonna watch the other one
16:47 who wants to see this one so there we go
16:49 when you see astronauts float on the
16:52 moon you are seeing proof they are not
16:56 on the moon what do they say well
16:59 gravity on the moon is 1/6 gravity who
17:01 knows if that's [ __ ] true or not we
17:03 never been there right it's all gonna be
17:05 a ratio of displacement of Heathrow
17:08 winds that's it but what happens when an
17:11 astronaut jumps up and down well one
17:14 it's 2x right so they've slowed the
17:17 camera down 50% and they probably rented
17:20 at 48 frames per second and then play it
17:22 back at 24 boom you have this
17:25 slow-motion thing one astronaut will
17:28 probably weigh on average as a human
17:30 being 180 pounds somewhere in there the
17:33 backpack weighs another hundred pounds
17:35 so that's what NASA set and then you get
17:38 their suit and know this other garb and
17:40 stuff and so they have maybe another 20
17:45 pounds 10 pounds something like that
17:46 right so if you take one-sixth gravity
17:50 you kind of round up you'd be about 50
17:53 pounds every astronaut would weigh 50
17:55 pounds all right I remember weighing 50
17:59 pounds do you remember being 3 years old
18:02 I remember being 4 years old and I
18:04 remember being 5 years old it's probably
18:07 around the room where I broke the fifty
18:08 fifty pound barrier in my life I got a
18:11 friend who has three dogs at all weigh
18:13 less than 50 pounds I'm sitting in a
18:15 room with a bunch of [ __ ] that weighs
18:17 less than 50 pounds
18:20 right when you're on the moon and you
18:23 weigh 50 pounds you're going to look
18:25 like a 50 pound kid run around the moon
18:27 you're not gonna be [ __ ] weightless
18:28 for any split second right you don't
18:31 jump up on earth as a child and you're
18:33 like look mom dead and like enjoy it son
18:35 because once you hit 50 pounds you're
18:38 gonna [ __ ] start you know landing on
18:41 the ground smoking gun total line of
18:45 [ __ ] bad science looked good we all
18:48 believed it I believed that up until
18:50 last year okay probably December 28 18 I
18:56 finally figured out I'm doing the math
18:58 on him thinking wait a minute gravity's
19:00 not gonna work like that it is what it
19:02 is another smoking gun in the movie by
19:07 Bart's a Berle you can just go si be re
19:11 L calm you need to make sure and he has
19:16 it online for free in the YouTube area
19:18 we need all need to purchase it to
19:20 support him but a funny thing happened
19:23 on the way the moon has a clip that was
19:26 leaked to bart sibrel to even put this
19:28 online at one point the 54 minute clip I
19:30 think 54 minutes I'm just trying to make
19:33 sure the runtime is correct where they
19:34 are faking a shot of Earth through a
19:37 portal window what are they doing well
19:41 if you remind their episodes I know
19:42 you've seen this and this is a little
19:44 difficult to explain so it's not
19:45 probably the top one you want to say but
19:48 if you show them the video on YouTube
19:50 send the link out a little bit of an
19:52 explanation if you just cut the part of
19:55 the film that that again go to the
19:57 YouTube video of his movie move the
20:01 playhead to this area and send it off
20:02 with a little time stamp so that they
20:04 can get right to the part that they're
20:06 supposed to see that's probably the best
20:07 way to do it they have got a camera on
20:10 the other side of the pod of this
20:12 capsule this thing they're looking out
20:16 of a round window that is inside of a
20:18 round rectangle actual window container
20:20 okay there's a lot of people to argue
20:22 with me there's no round windows in the
20:23 castle it's like my god how ignorant
20:26 these human beings are just look the
20:28 [ __ ] up it was in do the right stuff I
20:32 think which was the HBO
20:34 for all the right stuff excuse me you
20:36 know get Spike Lee [ __ ] mixed up all the
20:39 right stuff and it was Neil Armstrong
20:42 supposedly saying look I gotta have this
20:45 we gotta have a window got to have it
20:48 well it was kind of a hokey reality of
20:51 why the window was there but it's
20:52 perfectly round they're filming earth
20:54 low orbit 200 miles up roughly and
20:57 they're showing earth in this window
20:59 then they put a gel on the side of
21:02 window to simulate day and night you
21:04 know horizon because they're right on
21:07 top of a daytime side of it and they
21:09 ended up filming the Far Away shot first
21:11 and then they moved the camera closer to
21:14 the window and it's you know the
21:16 blackness around Earth which would
21:18 normally have the Milky Way and stars
21:19 well it's blackest it's the inside of
21:21 this container that they're inside of
21:23 and so when I got really close to it
21:26 they were supposed to be far away when
21:28 they were far away they were actually
21:29 supposed to be close so they got all the
21:31 chronology backwards because they're
21:32 practicing the shot damn fine
21:35 piece of journalism there and someone
21:37 from NASA leaked it out either by
21:39 accident or intentionally winds shown to
21:42 Buzz Aldrin in the backroom of a
21:44 bookstore this guy nearly [ __ ] a brick
21:46 on camera
21:47 he threatened to sue so Braille if this
21:50 was ever shown he said we're just the
21:54 passengers don't ask me we were just the
21:56 passengers go ask NASA how do you have
21:58 this footage he says guilty guilty
22:00 guilty [ __ ] guilty and then later
22:04 that day he punches the braille in the
22:05 face and everybody feels great whose
22:07 don'ts to believe in this fantasy called
22:10 the moon landings there for the record I
22:14 don't blame any of the astronauts they
22:15 had death threats they had pension
22:17 threats I might have done the same thing
22:20 who the hell knows right I think before
22:22 I died though I'd punch out and do a
22:25 little press conference ago we didn't go
22:27 [ __ ] see you later I'm out
22:28 right but that's not scene seemingly
22:32 possible yet another one second movie he
22:35 made astronauts gone wild absolutely one
22:39 of the most brilliant methodologies of
22:41 confirming the moon landings he sucked
22:44 into two astronauts that were in the
22:45 same limb together saying
22:47 capsule went down to the moon one guy is
22:49 sitting in his art studio one guy is in
22:53 his backyard in like some little like
22:56 tiki hut or something like that and I
23:00 actually want to commend I don't know
23:02 either one of these two guys the guy in
23:04 the backyard was actually pretty damn
23:06 cool
23:06 his approach to I think was very fun and
23:10 he knew about the Van Allen belt problem
23:13 and he just said I don't care about I
23:15 [ __ ] [ __ ] we went to the moon
23:17 that's how it works right and you know
23:21 he started being caught he started to
23:23 having to push this here and he's like
23:24 look I'm not gonna admit on camera we
23:25 didn't goes really what he's saying
23:26 right so get out you know but he was he
23:28 was actually polite to say Braille and
23:30 he understood he had been set up for
23:32 this this potential hoax stuff right but
23:36 here's the interesting thing
23:37 the first subtle thing that's going on
23:40 is when Bart asked them well explain to
23:41 me what happened from the moment you got
23:43 in the elevator to the moment you got
23:45 back and splashed in the ocean tell me
23:47 the story and the guy in the backyard
23:50 actually had everything memorized the
23:53 whole thing it's like he had been
23:54 rehearsing this his whole life well then
23:56 this happened and that happened then we
23:57 do this isn't we did that and he just
23:58 had the whole script memorized I'm
24:01 impressed man seriously so wash it to re
24:04 to recall every single time you got to
24:06 tell this story the bar hit him with one
24:09 simple question to sort of blew the
24:11 doors open before he got to the Van
24:14 Allen belts again the vanilla belts
24:17 exists because Project Orion was
24:18 greenlit and then it was cancelled and
24:20 there was there holding the [ __ ] data
24:22 from the first mission at ransom because
24:26 they say it's a matter of national
24:27 security
24:28 lie lie lie lie right but he asked him
24:33 he goes when you were landing on the
24:35 moon with the 10,000 pound thrust engine
24:37 which would have been through your butt
24:38 holes at the time that you were sitting
24:40 in this plane because the engines so
24:41 huge ever been in the living apartment
24:43 that they were in he said was there any
24:46 sound the first guy he contemplates the
24:51 question is if he'd never been asked
24:52 that question before he may not have
24:54 been asked that question in his whole 40
24:55 years plus before he actually answered
24:58 this question which is supposed to be
24:59 filmed around 2003 2000
25:01 - somewhere in there and the guy pauses
25:05 and then he goes no there's no sound in
25:07 space well where do we have a film that
25:11 was made where there was no sound in
25:12 space outside of interstellar copying
25:16 2001 a Space Odyssey which was after
25:18 this interview the only thing that this
25:20 guy had ever seen was 2001 a Space
25:21 Odyssey where Kubrick honored the fact
25:24 without an atmosphere you don't have
25:25 some problem
25:27 the astronauts not smart enough to
25:29 realize that if he's an oxygenated cabin
25:31 even if the even of the cabin was a
25:34 vacuum and he had a helmet on with
25:37 oxygen inside the helmet it would have
25:39 vibrated the his ass and everything he
25:42 would have gotten sound into his head it
25:44 probably wouldn't have traveled from it
25:46 was a pure vacuum ok it wouldn't have
25:47 traveled from the walls to his head
25:48 because there's nothing to do vibrate
25:50 but the thing is is the whole cabin was
25:52 oxygenated oxygenated and heated by the
25:54 way with computers running everyone's
25:56 trying to figure out what batteries they
25:58 [ __ ] use back at 69 because we can't
26:00 seem to run a laptop for more than you
26:02 know a few hours after the things 2 or 3
26:04 years old so his buddy who was in the
26:07 same capsule with him being interviewed
26:10 in the back yard asked the same question
26:11 and the guy said the right answer and he
26:15 just said it matter-of-factly zyc oh
26:16 yeah it was it was deafening but the guy
26:20 gave the right answer if you were in a
26:22 cabin with a bunch of oxygen of course
26:24 that [ __ ] thing 10,000 pound thrust
26:26 motor below you right so he busted him
26:31 smoking gun right there you don't get to
26:34 keep your history sorry buddy
26:36 sorry second thing Bart asked them what
26:40 about the Van Allen belts NASA said 1998
26:43 announced to CNN that they were so
26:45 lethal they're gonna have to check them
26:46 out again
26:46 Space Shuttle went up to over 400 miles
26:49 up astronauts started seeing you know
26:52 shooting stars inside their head and
26:53 they couldn't stop it because the
26:55 electrons were going through their
26:56 skulls going through the holy [ __ ]
26:58 through their skulls and bouncing off
27:00 their cones and rods and their eyeball
27:03 registering light and they had to drop
27:05 this space shuttle down and you know
27:08 clean up and go home now if you read all
27:11 the missions from 1998 from NASA you
27:13 will have no evidence
27:14 of this mission but sub rel in his first
27:18 movie a funny thing happened on the way
27:20 the moon has a copy of the article
27:21 because he made it in 2001 and it was
27:24 still online CNN is scrubbed old
27:27 articles and you can't find it anymore
27:30 but he asked the first guy in his art
27:32 studio what about the Van Allen belts
27:33 the two'd said whoa what do you mean he
27:37 goes well they're now considered to be
27:39 so lethal that human flesh can go
27:40 through them you were in a capsule of
27:43 1/4 inch aluminum aluminum is never on
27:48 this [ __ ] planet been used to protect
27:50 against radiation and there was a
27:55 listener that tried to patronize me with
27:58 my knowledge about radiation telling me
28:00 that the radiation from a nuclear bomb
28:02 is different than radiation from the Van
28:04 Allen belts the fundamental component of
28:07 radiation is an electron yes if you
28:10 punch a hole through an electric afirma
28:12 an atom and you're throwing all of the
28:15 atomic matter all over the place
28:17 you might get other things going into
28:19 your body but the fundamental component
28:21 of radiation under all circumstances is
28:23 a piece of atomic matter that is so
28:25 heavy
28:26 uranium plutonium that the electrons
28:29 can't be held in orbit and they
28:31 constantly eject from the element or the
28:34 component and that's what radiation is
28:37 right so what is the Van Allen belts an
28:41 electron cloud same [ __ ] dude but when
28:45 they push this astronaut on it he said
28:47 well he must not have been lethal
28:49 because we flew through them the second
28:53 guy just said I don't know anything
28:54 about this I just you know I know we
28:57 going through them bump up a bot alright
28:59 now there's some people who try to come
29:01 and speculate about the Van Allen belts
29:03 existing I don't know I mean I have seen
29:06 those belts my entire lifetime I mean in
29:09 illustrations and it is there has to be
29:12 a reason when a coronal mass ejection
29:15 comes at us from the Sun and again if
29:18 the Sun is a 10-inch ball earth is 36
29:21 feet away approximately and is about the
29:24 size of a third of a period and a piece
29:26 of paper
29:28 so we are teeny tiny specks so when you
29:30 see these big coronal mass ejections and
29:32 all these [ __ ] say oh man it's gonna
29:34 it's gonna fry all the electronics on
29:37 earth we're gonna have a huge blackout
29:38 that's all bunk man I mean like you'd
29:41 have to have you know a quarter of the
29:43 Sun just blow up and come out towards us
29:45 before we're gonna actually have a earth
29:47 frying event and we'll just vaporize in
29:50 two seconds right 97 percent according
29:53 to the authorities of a kernel mass
29:55 ejection comes right back to the Sun due
29:58 to the the pressure from the ether winds
30:01 pushing it back towards the Sun only 3%
30:04 ever escapes into the solar system to
30:07 then be serendipitously bumped into by
30:09 everything else but just like diffusion
30:12 and water ether behaves just like water
30:15 and so as this thing is spreading out in
30:17 space it gets diffused just like when
30:20 they throw a bunch of toxic [ __ ] in the
30:22 ocean they go hey it's okay little
30:24 diffuse and in a few years we'll just be
30:26 part of the earth same theory a lot of
30:29 the other smoking guns have to do with
30:31 temperature temperature on the surface
30:34 of the Moon now what I'm about to tell
30:37 you is based on complete conjecture
30:39 complete [ __ ] submitted by NASA
30:42 about the moon's surface
30:44 they have no [ __ ] idea how hot and
30:46 cold that place is they don't all right
30:49 now officially they could have a black
30:52 project that got there and somehow it
30:54 might be similar but back in 1969 it was
30:56 all made up what is their estimate and I
31:00 don't think they were trying to lie to
31:02 us but I think their estimate was in the
31:06 vacuum of space on the surface of the
31:08 Moon
31:09 again they're the one that says there's
31:11 no atmosphere and hey you kind of have
31:13 to believe it because we can see the
31:14 surface of the Moon with a great
31:15 telescope it looks crystal [ __ ] clear
31:17 and it wouldn't be crystal clear if
31:19 there is even the remote chance of
31:22 having an atmosphere on there to refract
31:24 light right they say that in the light
31:28 it's 280 degrees Fahrenheit I don't know
31:31 what that is in Celsius in the dark it's
31:34 the exact opposite 280 degrees
31:37 Fahrenheit negative the number has been
31:40 adjusted a little
31:42 just like the amount of miles to the
31:43 moon has been adjusted over time that's
31:46 the last time I heard it
31:47 dictated to me now again you don't have
31:49 to go up to 280 either way to have huge
31:52 goddamn problems with a lot of the stuff
31:54 that they did on the moon but the number
31:58 one thing that would have happened as
32:01 expanding and contracting of the
32:03 materials used in the moon missions now
32:07 there used to be a video online where
32:09 these documentary filmmakers who were
32:10 trying to isolate whether it was a hoax
32:12 or not had interviewed the gentleman
32:15 from Hasselblad that built the cameras
32:17 that were used at least in some of the
32:20 moon missions if not all the MU missions
32:21 now in my opinion one guy could not
32:24 build all the cameras being used but he
32:25 built a few of them as much the first
32:27 ones they let him go through the whole
32:30 spiel and he had one of the cameras in
32:32 front of him right and he went through
32:34 how it was built and all this other
32:35 stuff and definitely was built different
32:37 than the ones that my dad had when I was
32:38 a kid and the only thing that was ever
32:42 rumor was they had a special lubricant
32:43 that went into the unit itself but they
32:47 save this little Jim question at the end
32:48 and I've seen this with my own two eyes
32:49 they asked the guy what would happen if
32:52 we took this camera and made it to 80
32:54 for ten minutes and then stuck it in
32:58 negative to 80 for 10 minutes he'll for
33:01 even one minute right and the guy looked
33:03 with like deer eyes all of a sudden like
33:06 what
33:07 and it had dawned on him right in the
33:10 middle of the interview that this was a
33:12 factor that was dealt with on the moon
33:15 but he knows that what he submitted to
33:18 NASA would never have survived that his
33:20 words I swear to God verbatim as I
33:24 remember them was quote well it would
33:27 have exploded or it would explode he use
33:29 the word explode as I remember okay I
33:33 can't have your history now kanya so you
33:35 take this thing out it's in the back
33:38 door which is in the dark when we saw
33:40 Buzz Aldrin fully lit of course coming
33:42 down the back ladder invidia tried to do
33:44 this hocus-pocus horseshit inside of a
33:46 CG environment that's real right he
33:49 comes down he would add the camera I
33:51 mean you know Neil would've gone first
33:52 with the camera on his chest
33:55 so DZ walks in the light kaboom this
33:58 game would have exploded right now the
34:02 sun's radiation in its ambient form and
34:04 you're just getting a suntan on the on
34:07 the moon without an atmosphere okay
34:09 remember what dermatologists tell you
34:11 about the Sun they keep telling you to
34:14 get out of the Sun put a bunch of
34:15 sunscreen on part of that's to make sure
34:16 you have the worst health on planet
34:18 Earth by having no vitamin D coming out
34:20 of your pituitary gland believe me it's
34:22 a scam right it makes you sick and then
34:25 your skin gets [ __ ] shitty and then
34:27 of course the sunscreen when hit with
34:28 light it starts becoming a carcinogen
34:31 that's a big thing we've now figured out
34:32 so they're literally prescribing you
34:34 into skin cancer so that they can take
34:36 care of you and so that's the whole
34:38 [ __ ] scam unto itself but the reason
34:41 why we have UV protection and our car
34:43 windows on our sunglasses because lights
34:45 even going through the super thick
34:47 greenhouse gas layer and our atmosphere
34:49 up there still is potentially at a
34:52 microscopic level lethal when you're on
34:54 the moon with no atmosphere at all it's
34:57 so lethal that by 1989 NASA and this is
35:00 I got this first degree man from the
35:02 duty was on the project to do that was
35:05 responsible for coming up with a
35:07 summation so that they would have to
35:10 line the capsule with six inches of
35:13 water in order to protect an astronaut
35:15 from the lethal radiation in space
35:17 before coronal mass ejection and
35:19 definitely had nothing to do with the
35:21 vanilla belt just regular ambient
35:23 radiation so let me remind you of a blue
35:26 piece of history radiation where do we
35:29 first figure out that uranium had
35:31 radioactive properties where the
35:34 electrons escaped the bar of rady
35:37 uranium there's a brilliant woman by the
35:40 name of Madame Curie
35:41 she died of radiation exposure trying to
35:44 figure out what radiation was she had an
35:48 envelope of film because they did a lot
35:51 of exposures on things she had it in a
35:53 cabinet she put it the film down and
35:55 then had a bar of uranium as she put
35:58 down on top of the envelope one night
36:00 went home later on the week they ended
36:02 up using that film and all the shots had
36:04 this huge exposure right where the bar
36:08 of uranium
36:09 was and she figured out oh my god this
36:11 bar is emitting something that's
36:14 actually frying the film through the
36:16 envelope that's how they discovered
36:18 radiation now albeit a bar of your name
36:22 on top of you know a thin thin layer
36:25 paper and all that kind of stuff is
36:27 definitely a very intense exposure but
36:33 also a bar of uranium has something
36:34 called metals metal shielding which is
36:37 that the form of the bar itself is
36:38 actually capturing more of the radiation
36:41 internally than is actually escaping
36:42 externally and this is a big principle
36:44 of D U rounds that are in like at the
36:47 a-10 warthog as long as the round is
36:50 solid it has metal shielding which again
36:54 it has a far smaller radioactive
36:57 footprint than when it's shot out of the
36:59 barrel of this gun like it's like 14
37:01 inches or so 12 to 14 inches and it
37:04 liquefies in the air a second comes out
37:05 of that Gatling gun it's liquid but it's
37:08 together because it's so heavy when it
37:09 hits the tank it penetrates and spiders
37:11 everywhere which is why do you poisoning
37:14 is all over the deserts of the Middle
37:16 East the first crew that went over to
37:18 clean up all those tanks every single
37:20 member of the cleanup crew died of
37:22 radiation all right so you got a camera
37:24 in space right not only is it traveling
37:28 to the moon through the Van Allen belts
37:30 which is going to fry it to [ __ ]
37:32 death before you ever get there
37:33 including the astronauts once you get to
37:35 the moon and you walk outside with this
37:37 camera okay I you know the cameras all
37:41 the Nikon cameras that I ever dealt with
37:43 as a kid I believe that the whole thing
37:46 is made of mostly aluminum and stainless
37:49 steel not a real good repellent against
37:52 radiation had they surrounded it maybe
37:55 some two feet of concrete it would have
37:58 had a lot better chance of you know
37:59 effectively defending off some radiation
38:02 or they built the thing at a LED or
38:03 something right but weight is a huge
38:05 factor when doing any rocketry so that
38:07 didn't death it didn't happen for sure
38:09 right it definitely didn't happen so all
38:12 the film inside the cameras would have
38:13 been completely exposed simply by being
38:16 in this hostile environment and that's
38:18 just think that's negating completely
38:20 the consideration of the Van Alen
38:22 itself right the other super smoking-gun
38:25 is very very subtle very very subtle
38:28 when you look at the Apollo 11
38:31 photographs taken of the lunar lander on
38:35 the moon you will see a 10,000 pound
38:40 thrust engine coming out of the bottom
38:41 it's by the way it's just clean as a
38:44 whistle right suppose that's possible
38:47 but there's a little condom that was on
38:49 the bottom of this cone his little
38:52 sheath of material look like it probably
38:55 covered maybe maybe 50 percent tops
38:58 probably a third of the actual cone
39:00 itself but it's lying on the ground
39:02 right next to one of the legs of the
39:04 limb well you've seen the footage you've
39:08 seen the footage when they were landing
39:09 a bunch of dust popping out underneath
39:12 this limb
39:13 none of that dust ever got I need the
39:15 legs not ever got underneath the belly
39:17 of the ship but when the astronauts jump
39:19 around boy their legs you cover with
39:21 that fake lava dust or whatever they
39:23 used to build that stuff it got sticky
39:26 all over their bodies
39:27 was a big problem not for the legs not
39:30 when you're blasting it with the 10,000
39:32 pound thrust engine and why is that
39:34 condom still there that little cover
39:36 would have come off however far away
39:40 when they started punching the motor and
39:43 it's my assumption that it would have
39:46 burned you know if it I don't not sure
39:49 if they had some some idea that some
39:51 other rubber band thing pulled it off
39:53 first or they just simply said look when
39:55 this rocket launches the whole thing's
39:57 gonna come off don't worry about it no
39:58 burn marks on it no dirt on it it was as
40:02 if some prop guy just dropped it down
40:05 there complete [ __ ] you don't get to
40:09 keep your history I'm really sorry
40:11 now one of the other things is starting
40:13 to pop up that's going to be probably a
40:15 part of my episode too are the batteries
40:19 that supposedly kept this whole module
40:21 going from the moment it takes off from
40:23 the planet Earth and there's no
40:25 extension cord attached to the Saturn 5
40:27 all the way to space all the orbiting
40:30 and then all the way back what battery
40:33 is going to provide heat so the
40:35 astronauts don't freeze to death right
40:38 what do you think would happen to you if
40:42 you went outside well here's the other
40:44 thing - there's there's a there's a bit
40:46 of a complete mathematical problem with
40:49 the equation of what's actually
40:51 happening inside this limb what did they
40:54 say
40:54 light was in terms of temperature around
40:57 280 degrees Fahrenheit what did they say
41:00 the dark was 280 degrees negative well
41:03 if you have a limb sitting on the moon
41:05 one half of it minimum is going to get
41:08 blasted with light in the other apps
41:09 going to have a shadow on it so you're
41:11 going to have huge heat wave coming up
41:14 here where match I think starts about
41:16 320 degrees Fahrenheit so you're only 40
41:19 degrees away from a match lighting the
41:22 other side is so damn cold that if a
41:24 human being were to walk out in that
41:26 vacuum of space
41:27 you'd start freezing to death like
41:29 immediately right what happens when a
41:31 what pain Weber right his plane D
41:35 pressurized they said everybody inside
41:37 suffocated and froze to death in two
41:39 seconds no one felt anything now was
41:42 recently watching the cinema Tyler's
41:45 breakdown 2001 a Space Odyssey and when
41:48 they did the scene where Dave ejects
41:51 himself on the back of the pod into one
41:53 of the sort of pressure pressure lock
41:57 areas he said that that he thinks that
42:01 the human body can live for one minute
42:04 in the vacuum of space at it I was
42:08 always told in in my physics class an
42:10 astronomy class that it's actually zero
42:12 Kelvin which is about 367 degrees
42:15 Fahrenheit or something like that
42:15 negative right so in that realm you I
42:18 think you'd be an ice cube in about half
42:20 a second it's gonna freeze you and your
42:22 internal organs just boom right off the
42:24 bat maybe there's some other science
42:26 that I'm unaware of but he said one
42:29 minute when the famous famous dude
42:33 Pascal did his hot air balloon
42:38 experiment where he said the earth look
42:40 like a flat disc with turned up edges he
42:44 had a sphere which he tried to control
42:48 which side of the sphere
42:49 was actually pointing towards Sun he had
42:52 painted 1/2 the sphere black and left
42:54 the other ones stainless steel like a
42:55 mirror his objective was to turn the
42:58 black one I think no no turn the
43:01 reflective one towards the Sun I think
43:03 and or maybe the black one towards the
43:05 Sun or whatever he was trying to figure
43:06 try to basically balance the heat within
43:08 his unit but he kept spinning the entire
43:10 time and it didn't really work well you
43:13 know you know who knows of the whole
43:14 history of that dude has been co-opted
43:16 and saw fake but I think inside the limb
43:19 you have a problem how do you do this
43:21 right any of you've lived in the hot
43:23 regions of the world especially Texas or
43:26 Arizona and it's summertime Nevada you
43:30 know that the very windows of your house
43:32 if towards the Sun and it's a hundred
43:34 and fifteen degrees out you can't put
43:36 your hand on that you especially
43:38 couldn't put your hand on any metal
43:39 because it'll literally burn your flesh
43:41 I've seen little kids in Kansas when I
43:44 was a kid go down a slide that was a
43:46 stainless steel slide and his mom's like
43:49 oh honey go and he doesn't want to go
43:50 and that [ __ ] slide was boiling hot
43:55 to the point I saw a kid go down once
43:56 and literally I watched the back of the
43:58 skin on his legs stick to the [ __ ]
44:01 slide and by the time he got down the
44:03 bottom you had no skin on the back of
44:05 his legs he's screaming to death poor
44:08 kid
44:08 and that's just planet Earth so what do
44:12 you do when you have one side of your
44:13 limb that's gonna be expanding one way
44:15 because of this huge heat signature and
44:18 then all the metal around the backside
44:20 of this thing is going to be in really
44:22 cold temperatures right now they did
44:23 wrap it in a bunch of weird foil and all
44:26 the scotch tape and it was tint rods and
44:29 all this other stuff I mean the unit is
44:31 just the most laughable looking thing on
44:33 planet earth I'm sorry guys god bless
44:35 him for Trey but the batteries what
44:39 battery system in 1969 is going to be
44:42 able to furnish all this power
44:44 constantly right it just got more and
44:46 more absurd as all the missions went
44:48 back to the moon the amount of stuff
44:49 they did on the moon got longer and
44:51 longer and more elaborate how's that
44:53 possible
44:54 now when I was a kid I was told that the
44:56 moon buggy
44:58 rent on the equivalent of a 9-volt
45:00 battery and you know they say cuz there
45:03 was less gravity and it's like [ __ ]
45:05 okay one that thing weighed 800 pounds
45:09 okay one-sixth gravity you're over a
45:12 hundred pounds on that vehicle driving
45:14 in dirt a 9-volt battery oh really so
45:17 let's make a hundred pound Rover once I
45:19 get down Huntington Beach put it in the
45:21 sand and you show me a 9-volt battery
45:23 they can rotate those tires digging into
45:25 the soil and all that stuff
45:27 complete [ __ ] okay let's go to the
45:31 next smoking gun talking about the moon
45:34 buggy the dude in the buggy is a dummy
45:38 there's a little rhyme for you in case
45:40 you got to remember the dude in the
45:42 buggy is a dummy how do we know it's a
45:45 dummy because we can open our eyes and
45:47 look at all the footage and whether or
45:49 not some miniature or whatever who gives
45:51 a [ __ ] right the dude doesn't move at
45:53 all
45:54 there's a hand that's attached to the
45:57 steering wheel on the other hands just
45:58 down there
45:59 and supposedly every single time they
46:02 drove the buggy every single time there
46:05 was nothing intelligent going on with
46:07 the person who is in the driver's seat
46:08 never turn the steering wheel never
46:11 waving at his buddy remember they play
46:12 golf at one point they're always goofing
46:15 off [ __ ] around on this set so what
46:18 if they got all stoic and completely
46:20 behaved when they got in the buggy no
46:22 they'd be screaming you know it's like
46:24 it was Apollo 15 I actually missed
46:26 stated that because I think I said it
46:27 twelve several times in the past it's 15
46:29 where the buggy goes up I had someone
46:33 quote it wrong to me and that's where I
46:34 got stuck in my head the wrong way but
46:37 go look at the footage it's a joke it's
46:39 a complete joke right in front of your
46:41 face you don't get to keep your history
46:44 sorry and there's a beautiful one I
46:47 think I heard bart sibrel say this first
46:49 so I'm gonna throw the credit to him
46:51 during the entire moon mission fiasco
46:57 from 69 to 72 six missions supposed to
47:00 land on the moon in all cases they have
47:03 video cameras all right now what never
47:09 occurred ever ever ever in
47:12 mission well someone's got a video
47:14 camera and the roll camera and point it
47:19 from the moon any position like I don't
47:21 care where it is
47:22 and point it towards Earth now I don't
47:27 give a [ __ ] if NASA said don't do that
47:30 you wouldn't be able to stop astronauts
47:33 from doing that
47:33 they would take it and shoot earth
47:36 because what would be the most amazing
47:38 thing that you would see I mean
47:41 literally you put a gun against anyone
47:42 said that's been to the moon what's the
47:44 most amazing thing you saw the whole
47:47 [ __ ] time you were there it's where
47:49 you're from 260 or 237,000 miles away on
47:54 average that is the most amazing moment
47:57 and you're not videotaping that well but
47:59 we got a videotape of you know the the
48:02 limb blowing up and going yet back into
48:04 outer space and perfectly mirroring
48:06 itself with the module that sentient
48:08 orbit a maneuver that's just insanely
48:10 [ __ ] complicated and they never made
48:13 a mistake six times in a row boys
48:15 there's no problem just clip goes
48:17 together full-blown Hollywood right why
48:20 didn't they make that shot happen
48:22 because they can't they can't do it this
48:27 is the inside of a warehouse folks I
48:29 don't give a [ __ ] if it's a dome a
48:30 square box a rectangular box a tow
48:33 matter tetrahedron box you can't place
48:35 earth in the proper location at the
48:37 proper scale to get that shot happening
48:41 oh there's a still shot of it which when
48:45 you pull and high contrast from the
48:46 original submitted on the internet you
48:48 get to see this perfect square around
48:50 earth because that negative has been cut
48:51 and pasted directly into the other
48:53 negative straight up Hollywood
48:54 compositing you don't get to keep your
48:56 history now there's another one that
48:59 Bart made me aware of that I think is
49:01 absolutely tremendous it is it is a
49:05 smoking gun in a way but it's one that
49:07 you can kind of throw out if everyone's
49:09 on board with the other smoking guns and
49:11 they're like oh my god throw this one
49:13 out there is like a little cherry on top
49:16 Bart recalled what it took the Boeing
49:20 Company to make the 747 he said look
49:25 7:47 took I believe it's at least three
49:29 more years to get off the ground then
49:31 when the moon missions were announced to
49:34 actually stepping on the moon here's why
49:37 this is a big deal by the time they
49:39 announced the creation of the 747 and
49:42 the intent to create this big-ass ship
49:44 right they'd already been flying for
49:47 over 40 years before roughly so they
49:53 already had aviation figured out they
49:54 had wingspans figured out they had all
49:56 kinds of jets that were flying but that
49:59 747 which was just a bigger version of
50:02 everything else couldn't get off the
50:04 ground and I think over a hundred and
50:07 sixty attempts to get it off the ground
50:09 it's over 150 for sure so they kept
50:12 running it down the runway and they
50:13 couldn't get enough lift on these wings
50:15 they couldn't figure out how to build
50:16 everything to get it to work and that
50:18 took longer to master with decades of
50:22 previous experience flying then it took
50:24 us to go to the moon for the very first
50:26 time and yet we nailed it every single
50:27 time - you know supposedly Apollo 13
50:31 which again the official report on what
50:33 the explosion was outside the module was
50:36 like a paragraph it didn't really say
50:39 what exploded to my knowledge there was
50:42 no reengineering of anything as a result
50:47 of this mysterious explosion right I
50:49 mean if when the Pinto for instance back
50:51 in the set or 70s and 80s kept exploding
50:54 anytime someone ran into the back of it
50:56 because the gas tank was in a bad
50:57 position and they didn't want to put a
50:59 little a little liner in there or
51:01 something a little shield in there they
51:05 waited till they got killed enough
51:07 people and [ __ ] burning fires and
51:09 then they redesigned it there a recall
51:12 Christ if we almost lost you know
51:14 hundreds of millions of dollars I mean
51:16 it was nine and a half billion dollars
51:17 was consumed from Bart's estimate for
51:20 the whole moon mission fiasco and this
51:22 is 1960s and 70s money man that's a ton
51:27 of money and so you're not gonna throw
51:30 away a billion dollars again on an
51:32 accident that might occur you got to
51:34 stop the whole program just like when
51:35 the space shuttle Challenger exploded
51:37 they pull
51:38 they don't launch for a little while
51:40 until they figure out what happened when
51:41 the it was a challenger burned up coming
51:45 in they grounded everything until he
51:48 figured out what was going on and then
51:49 they announced the public different
51:52 changes in foam and all kinds of other
51:54 methodologies of protecting these folks
51:56 so they don't die all right now there's
52:00 been some things out there that again
52:02 are they're presented as great pieces of
52:06 evidence but again they just opened up
52:08 too many excuses why this occurred one
52:13 of them is blatantly wrong and when I
52:16 was first getting into this I fell for
52:17 it before it because I didn't have the
52:19 the other piece of the information but
52:21 one of them was the big footprint on the
52:23 moon which has sort of you know a
52:26 slatted horizontal pattern on this
52:28 bottom of the shoe and then they would
52:30 show you the bottom of the shoes that
52:32 the astronauts put on when they got
52:33 inside the elevator to go up to the
52:35 saturn v launch and the bottom of their
52:38 shoes are smooth leather all that seems
52:41 ridiculous to me but they went ahead
52:42 what happened was they gave them these
52:44 little booties to put on the bottom of
52:46 their shoe the Bart had a really great
52:48 observation which was that if it's 280
52:51 degrees fahrenheit out there and you got
52:53 a rubber bootie on the bottom of your
52:55 shoe over time
52:58 that bootie would turn into glue I mean
53:00 it would just turn into [ __ ] because
53:01 it'd be completely mulched if you take
53:04 your average galoshes that you have and
53:06 turn up your oven to 280 and put them in
53:08 their.what on a cookie sheet take a look
53:11 at what they're gonna look like ten
53:13 hours later because that's how long they
53:15 were roaming around at times of their
53:17 days up there at times right one of the
53:19 other great smoking guns is the fact
53:21 that they use sets at least twice
53:23 different sets they use twice so you
53:25 would have again one set with the same
53:28 mountains in the background and it
53:30 didn't have any rocks of any kind big
53:33 rocks or anything like you know it's
53:35 pretty smooth let's put that when
53:36 there's the lunar module on another
53:37 mission later it's the same set same
53:40 mountains in the background with a bunch
53:41 of different rocks leading up to the
53:44 module module it's been kind of pushed
53:45 into a different spot on the same set
53:47 the excuse room now says it's oh it
53:50 those mountains are so big in the
53:51 background
53:52 that they're still showing up even
53:54 though we're in a different spot and I
53:55 mean like how goddamn ignorant is that
53:58 right go towards the Rocky Mountains of
54:00 Colorado from Kansas and then come at it
54:04 from Nebraska and tell me that those
54:07 mountains look exactly the same in your
54:09 eyeball they don't you're looking at it
54:11 from a different perspective they're not
54:12 gonna be in the same spot but again
54:14 insulting your intelligence with their
54:17 debunking [ __ ] I'm making this
54:19 episode which is obviously a bunch of
54:21 repeats from other stuff because I'm
54:24 changing the tints by which we present
54:26 this information these are smoking guns
54:29 these are things that you can prove on
54:31 your cellphone and a nice little
54:33 conversation with someone give them a
54:35 video I've made someone else's made and
54:38 you can just look at them and go there
54:40 you go this means this is fake every
54:44 single mission has this stuff in it and
54:47 so it's all fake one of the things that
54:51 I hear a lot from people that I don't
54:54 know they get embarrassed in public or
54:56 whatever it is they say [ __ ] like well I
55:00 think maybe the first mission was faked
55:03 or they'll say that the new one is is
55:06 that the Neil Armstrong footage was
55:07 faked of him coming down the ladder and
55:10 saying those words right but they faked
55:14 that because they couldn't get the
55:15 footage back to earth and Nixon wanted
55:17 to be alive and so they fainted whatever
55:20 dude the whole thing is fake the whole
55:22 goddamn thing is fake we got to be
55:26 mature to deal with it no no you guys
55:28 are on board you're on board man the
55:33 other one that I think we should
55:34 probably lean away from is the sea rock
55:36 there's a rock looks like it's paper
55:38 mache someone said it was a shadow from
55:40 an antenna again the sea would be white
55:43 if it was a pubic hair on the film
55:45 because it wouldn't have exposed the
55:47 film which has a base color of white it
55:49 wouldn't be dark the only way that
55:51 happens is I think if you are running
55:54 through a movie projector then it's
55:56 black because you're you're obstructing
55:58 the light coming to the silver screen
56:00 but that's not the way that film was
56:02 developed okay the other one is there's
56:04 obviously a lot of space
56:06 halation about the the landing the
56:10 landing back in the ocean I would say to
56:14 most of you guys don't worry about that
56:16 if we happen to find something that is
56:17 absolutely conclusive then fine we've
56:21 got something to occlusive I'm gonna
56:22 share one little piece that I've shared
56:23 before but you can kind of stop at any
56:27 one of these smoking guns
56:28 I mean honestly for me one smoking gun
56:31 is all you need
56:32 yeah it's fun to go through all the
56:34 other stuff but you don't have to now
56:38 there have been some Caltech physicists
56:40 that have taken and they made videos on
56:43 this where they did a computer
56:47 simulation of atmosphere they took this
56:51 bullet shaped module that's coming back
56:53 from the moon and they did this idea
56:57 that NASA tells us which is a blast
56:59 shield on the flat side and they turn it
57:00 around and the bullets going backwards
57:02 all right so pointy Pony side up flat
57:05 disc bottom with the blast shield on the
57:08 bottom coming down through the
57:09 atmosphere they were absolutely unable
57:13 to get this thing not to flip and roll
57:16 because what how do bullets come out of
57:18 guns straight pointy side going straight
57:22 right that's why they're made that way
57:24 right now pistols have hollow points and
57:27 that kind of thing but that's a
57:28 close-range
57:28 situation and quite frankly if it did
57:32 roll it's just gonna do more damage
57:34 right but you have your Eagle all you
57:36 know hollow points that'll [ __ ] not
57:38 go through the back of you and they able
57:40 to salute Lee cave in your chest cave in
57:42 your head you're gonna die period right
57:44 I mean even if you hit your shoulder you
57:46 might lose your arm I mean it's bad news
57:48 right but normal 556 308 all round
57:52 rounds go right through you right
57:55 because they're supposed to go super
57:57 long distances well this capsule is a
58:00 point and it's going to go back the
58:02 other direction it's going to flip
58:03 around but it probably if you would just
58:05 let it come with the point it's going to
58:08 come through and probably stay in that
58:10 configuration but they even tried that
58:11 and they said it started rolling still
58:13 because it's not a big long surface to
58:17 to
58:18 when I was dispersed the friction evenly
58:21 me I that's all I know is what I saw on
58:24 this particular video but he was using
58:26 the computer simulation software to do
58:29 this and he's just showing you the clip
58:30 man I can't get this to do this maybe
58:33 NASA figured out magic but I can't
58:35 figure out how to pull this off and I've
58:37 tried all the angles they said were the
58:38 specific angles this thing had to come
58:40 in at using the books to figure this out
58:42 and I can't figure this out so as I said
58:47 in the keeping the pressure on episode
58:49 this is starting to go to the next stage
58:54 within the NASA organization again tons
58:57 of propaganda and lies coming out of the
59:00 organization that is NASA which makes it
59:03 into mainstream press which makes it
59:04 into all your science mags and
59:06 everywhere that they want to pump this
59:08 stuff YouTube and their line now let me
59:15 get this qualify a lot here so do you
59:20 know people that really think we went to
59:21 the moon yes you do most likely it
59:25 wouldn't be hard if you didn't know one
59:26 just go into the supermarket look at old
59:28 people and ask them they'll tell you
59:29 that we went all right are they lying
59:33 not really they're telling you what they
59:35 believe is true they just don't know
59:38 what the truth is they also probably
59:40 patriotic Americans and so they are
59:42 totally on board one of our listeners
59:45 said something beautiful which is
59:47 probably not true obviously not true in
59:48 its absolute form but he said you
59:51 Americans are the only people to think
59:53 that you went to the moon rest of us we
59:56 talked about it in Europe we know you
59:57 didn't go
59:58 I saved this towards the end because I
60:00 also mentioned this at one of my recap
60:03 videos earlier this season but it's
60:04 something to remember because this comes
60:06 up a lot in the suggestions or Russian
60:09 psyche suggest in the comments on
60:10 YouTube the question comes up all the
60:13 time well I don't understand how they
60:16 could get the Russians to go along with
60:18 our lie because there's this perception
60:20 which i think is very fascinating that
60:22 the Russians had enough technology to
60:24 prove that we didn't go one I think
60:28 that's an assumption that probably isn't
60:29 completely true we don't know what they
60:31 had
60:32 right I think they would - I actually
60:34 honestly agree with that but I don't you
60:37 know Russians have never come out and
60:38 said no no no we had this this little
60:41 thing that tracks this thing and then we
60:43 know that you faked it but the reasons
60:46 why the reason why excuse me
60:47 the Russians went along with the hoax is
60:50 that they also did hoaxes when you start
60:54 looking at all the NASA flare sorry
60:56 excuse me the USSR footage of moon
60:58 experiences and then you start studying
61:01 stop-motion animation if they move a
61:04 little model take a snapshot move a
61:06 little model same thing with all those
61:08 little cartoons with the reindeers when
61:10 you were kids or or Tim Burton's work
61:12 with Nightmare Before Christmas same
61:16 technology
61:17 one of the huge smoking guns that NASA's
61:20 spacewalks were complete [ __ ] was
61:24 that they made a mistake as the narrator
61:27 of the last time I saw this video
61:28 brilliantly said and I wish I could give
61:31 specific credit to whoever this was
61:33 there is the astronaut crawling out of
61:36 the module he's in and he's got the
61:40 oxygen tube going to him they even did
61:42 this really neat shot of a glove that
61:44 flew out right it was a romantic thing
61:46 that happened right oopsy-daisy
61:47 lost a glove the astronaut goes out and
61:51 he's floating and he's like in this like
61:53 crouching hidden tiger whatever mode
61:56 right his head his helmet turns his
62:01 helmet turns on a swivel as if the
62:04 helmets actually attached to his jawbone
62:05 and it's got a swivel and so what you do
62:08 is you see this you know sort of like
62:10 cool motorcycle helmet thing he's got on
62:12 and it goes burp and it turns to the
62:14 left as if he's looking back at the
62:17 camera well problem that suit doesn't
62:22 have that feature that helmet is on and
62:25 when it's on it doesn't rotate why
62:28 because the rotation is part of the
62:30 detachment from the suit if he were to
62:32 turn his head he'd be undoing the very
62:35 seal that is keeping him safe and so
62:38 it's an impossibility
62:39 it's a it's a it's an artistic license
62:44 that was taken a
62:46 who it was an artist taking his liberty
62:49 of making this animation look more cool
62:52 hats off stop animation was really well
62:56 done but it was stop animation and the
62:59 other factor behind this is that the
63:01 everything in the foreground is jittery
63:04 right I mean everything everything
63:06 that's supposed to be coming out of this
63:08 unit including the astronaut his tube
63:10 his glove it's odd but this the earth
63:14 it's spinning down below is moving
63:17 smooth so it might have been a composite
63:20 shot against the animation or I mean
63:23 actually I don't know why this wouldn't
63:24 be actually equally jittery besides a
63:26 composite shot right you shoot one on
63:29 one frame and the back the black part is
63:32 all transparent and you push the earth
63:35 through as a separate reel again what's
63:39 amazing is and what's unfortunate by
63:41 NASA not coming out with the truth and
63:44 we know why they don't they're gonna
63:45 lose their sixty million dollars JPL is
63:47 gonna go under potentially people will
63:49 be brought up on charges if they're
63:51 still alive again I think that we could
63:54 easily from Donald Trump's perspective
63:56 grant immunity first and say anybody who
64:00 comes out and tells me what happened
64:02 from 1969 to 1972 you have full immunity
64:06 all of you astronauts still living off
64:08 your pensions I guarantee you your
64:10 pensions are going to remain in place in
64:12 fact I'll put a million-dollar bonus out
64:15 of my Trump fund for anyone who does
64:17 I'll protect your pension and I'll give
64:19 you an extra million bucks and give it
64:20 to your family no inheritance tax go
64:23 then we'd be able to appreciate how to
64:26 hold other realm this science of the
64:29 hoax and we could finally straighten out
64:31 history who did what when and how
64:33 now I guaranteed some new moon evidence
64:35 coming it is nothing to do with this
64:38 episode in terms of what I've presented
64:39 here so that guarantee is still coming
64:43 and I'm gonna hold that until we get it
64:46 executed beautifully now what I find
64:49 interesting I did a whole episode on
64:51 dealing with the moon hoax so I'm gonna
64:52 plagiarize myself a little bit here
64:54 because I got a little more Tom my stick
64:55 and I think it's always important to
64:57 remember this because as we get in
64:59 conversation
64:59 with each other it's important that we
65:02 don't I would say don't get into
65:08 situation where your disowning human
65:10 beings as a result of these
65:11 conversations one you're seeing the
65:15 frailty of their minds which is actually
65:17 I think super fascinating isn't it
65:20 I sit downstairs in the lounge and
65:22 there's all kinds of people that can't
65:25 believe it
65:26 and so you don't we present we present
65:28 and we don't call anybody names and we
65:31 just let them walk out still believing
65:33 or chewing on some facts that hopefully
65:35 keep them up at night for a little while
65:36 but it's interesting to see a grown man
65:38 especially a grown man lookin at proof
65:43 that we didn't go looking at these
65:45 smoking guns usually without the
65:47 scientific aptitude to really validate
65:49 anything but believe me out of
65:52 everything I've said in this episode
65:53 most people know as some of this stuff
65:55 is totally true I mean they know that
65:57 they know enough scientific fact to
65:58 understand that you know taking a
66:00 complex Hasselblad and jerking its heat
66:04 500 degrees in in different directions
66:06 it's gonna cause it to explode most
66:08 people understand the radiation exposes
66:10 film otherwise Madame Curie's entire
66:12 life is a lie with Judaism but we're
66:15 always trying to figure out how how does
66:17 the world have so many problems in 2019
66:21 how do we get such a corrupt group of
66:24 politicians bankers military at times
66:29 law enforcement at times intelligence
66:33 agencies at times being super duper
66:35 corrupt well some of its going to be
66:38 duping innocent people who believe
66:41 they're doing good and the other ones
66:42 are just super devious one of the things
66:45 I like to sort of remind people that are
66:50 unfortunately most of them are baby
66:52 boomers so I don't mean to put a big
66:53 stink on baby boomers because there's a
66:55 lot that are totally awake and they're
66:57 doing their part putting their skin in
66:59 the game to wake their other friends up
67:01 so there's a lot of great people out
67:02 there at all ages but most commonly when
67:06 I find people who still believe all
67:10 these official stories you know they all
67:13 the assassinations
67:13 of Kennedy Kandi's brother MLK Malcolm X
67:16 here's what's weird to me when someone
67:20 does a hoax one time and no one's ever
67:23 seen the hoax before ever ever ever I
67:25 think we can all understand why people
67:27 believe that it was legit because they'd
67:30 never seen the trick before but in one
67:32 decade four amazing people were murdered
67:35 because they were gonna change the world
67:38 against these controlling forces you
67:42 would think that the people who lived in
67:44 the 60s and a bunch of them absolutely
67:46 did do what I'm about to say but a bunch
67:49 of them I think the majority of them
67:50 didn't they never got hip to the hoax of
67:54 these assassinations being a [ __ ]
67:56 lone gunman every goddamn time right
67:58 Malcolm X supposedly the nation in Islam
68:01 blew him away you know get your hand on
68:04 my pocket doubt Topsy I believe said
68:07 that Malcolm X was shot from the front
68:10 was it the flee the area above the stage
68:13 someone's shooting down on him but I
68:16 think most people are like well that guy
68:18 was militant he was sort of Pro black
68:20 POW or Black Panther which we were doing
68:22 all kinds of wild crimes and all kinds
68:24 of stuff so kind of like well that guy
68:26 was a [ __ ] starter I don't think that's
68:28 actually true I think he just spoke very
68:31 clearly about what was going on with
68:33 Malcolm R sorry Martin Luther King
68:36 always kept it very diplomatic he always
68:39 he knew everything that was going on he
68:41 was being framed for sleeping against
68:43 his wife and fathering kids and you know
68:45 out of wedlock and all this other rumors
68:47 that were then later admitted in a
68:49 Senate Court or Senate hearing by the
68:51 alphabet agencies that they were they
68:54 were actually doing this against him and
68:55 it wasn't true but he played it
68:58 first-class right he played it as a
69:00 diplomat I have respect for both
69:02 perspectives you know Malcolm X saying
69:04 look I'd rather know that some was
69:06 racist against me than them to talk to
69:08 me as if they accepted me when the
69:11 second they walk away they're gonna stab
69:12 me in the back every way they possibly
69:14 can how can how can you not respect that
69:17 I think what's really great about that
69:19 is that isn't the author Alex Haley I
69:23 think he was the guy that wrote the book
69:25 on Malcolm X
69:27 of all the history I've ever read about
69:29 a single individual that had this sort
69:31 of influence on society yeah we're off
69:33 topic a little bit but this is sort of
69:34 the formula of waking up his appears to
69:38 be an extremely accurate portrayal this
69:40 guy's life
69:41 nothing was polished up again I can't
69:45 quite remember the chapter that talked
69:46 about his assassination and whether or
69:48 not he disputed into facts I don't
69:50 remember that being the case otherwise
69:52 that would have been suspicious way
69:53 before recently because I read that book
69:55 in the 90s but one thing I get to with
69:59 baby boomers as I say look you want me
70:02 to calm down with conspiracy theories
70:04 because once you tell someone like two
70:05 or three conspiracy theories you get
70:07 this generalization you believe
70:09 everything is a conspiracy everything
70:11 not everything is a conspiracy right and
70:14 believe me what's really [ __ ]
70:16 hilarious about these people even people
70:18 I know who are [ __ ] massively
70:19 intelligent as I hear this statement
70:23 over and over and over again and this is
70:24 what my co-host Kyle and there's a funny
70:27 story about this with MKULTRA I'll
70:29 repeat here and I'll let it I'll tell
70:32 this I'll tell you the quote through
70:34 what he said he called me in or I called
70:38 him in like December of 2007 he not been
70:40 best friends since 1989
70:42 long time in and I said dude I'm you
70:46 know the world is [ __ ] totally
70:47 corrupt it's it's bankers bankers
70:49 bankers on Elevens an inside job all
70:51 this oh [ __ ]
70:52 and he's listening to me he's so
70:55 unprepared for I'm about to tell him
70:56 that he he's like silent on the phone
70:59 and this guy's like a [ __ ] rocker
71:01 I mean he's so progressive he's not in
71:04 any bubble of any kind but it was
71:06 hitting him with so much information he
71:09 didn't order processes so he says to me
71:11 he goes he goes it sounds to me like
71:14 well his quote was he goes he says dude
71:18 there's just evil people in the world
71:19 not everything is a conspiracy
71:21 meaning the terrorists for now 11 were
71:24 real and blah blah blah and very just
71:27 kind of like dismissive of everything I
71:29 just told him and I don't know if I did
71:31 a good job telling him or not so fast
71:33 forward to 2008 it's fourth of July
71:36 weekend week I am on vacation
71:40 I haven't heard from Carla since
71:41 December the previous year and it's not
71:44 like he and I at the time didn't go a
71:46 couple months without talking to each
71:47 other and it wasn't uncommon for us not
71:51 to talk to each other you know but this
71:53 was a pretty long stint plus I dropped
71:55 this on him and he had a really weird
71:56 reaction to it and I remember I was
71:58 sitting in the passenger seat of a car I
72:00 think my girlfriend was driving the car
72:03 and my phone rings and it's Kyle coucher
72:06 I'm like oh this is crazy
72:09 Bing what's up brother all he says on
72:12 the other side of the phone is you were
72:13 right I said what he goes you were right
72:16 I said right about what he goes I just
72:18 finish the zeitgeist the movie this is
72:20 right when he came out right he goes you
72:23 were completely right because I was a
72:25 total [ __ ] and we had this great
72:27 conversation right and so what I still
72:30 here today in 2019 is not everything is
72:34 a conspiracy they're just shitty people
72:36 in this world and that really talks
72:39 about things that are not moon based but
72:41 it's very interesting so what I tell
72:43 baby boomers today you come at me with
72:45 these officials story adaptation you
72:47 know pressure points you need to accept
72:49 [ __ ] history for the way it was
72:51 written and we know that the victors
72:53 write the history books but weren't
72:54 ignore that right as I say look we've
72:58 been running the war world according to
73:00 you baby boomers since you guys grew up
73:02 and took power okay would you say the
73:07 world is better today than it was 40
73:09 years ago 50 years ago 60 years ago is
73:11 the educational system better in the
73:12 United States of America do we have this
73:15 many bums and people in welfare no
73:19 homeless people I should say no did kids
73:23 get education 'he's worth hundreds of
73:25 thousands of dollars that can't get
73:26 employed they're pouring my coffee for a
73:27 living did we have that back in the day
73:29 no we had trade skills good
73:34 old-fashioned trade skills go build a
73:36 house go fix a car go fix my plumbing
73:38 whatever I'll fix your thing however I
73:40 can fix my thing because I got a trade
73:41 skill to the world was balanced it was
73:44 beautiful it was actually way more
73:45 [ __ ] moral than it is today right so
73:48 I say look we've done your methodology
73:51 of what if you really boil it down to
73:53 how
73:53 which these [ __ ] research anything or
73:55 think 0 right 0 [ __ ] research but
74:01 they know everything always repeat that
74:02 right when nothing makes any sense
74:06 when these official stories come up and
74:07 it's like two is same as three you know
74:12 how many lights do you see right there
74:14 in a level of absolute doublespeak
74:18 cognitive dissidence they are the people
74:22 that say the emperor has disclosed on a
74:24 living in a total bubble of constant
74:27 denial that's how the world turns into a
74:31 complete [ __ ] because the evil people
74:33 the planet they have a strategy they're
74:36 successful they've got resources whether
74:39 we like it or not most of them are
74:40 really brilliant I mean it's utterly
74:42 brilliant I see climate change [ __ ] all
74:44 the time every [ __ ] day someone's
74:46 like somebody donated a bunch of money
74:49 they made they took all their tax
74:51 savings they got from Donald Trump's tax
74:53 brackets saying which supposedly doesn't
74:55 exist if you talk to liberal right and
74:57 they donated it to climate change
74:59 research and there's an article on it
75:01 how about how [ __ ] great they were
75:02 okay it's you threw away your money into
75:05 a globalist propaganda either you're
75:08 dumb as a [ __ ] bag of hammers and you
75:10 haven't done any research on global
75:11 warming or you're trying to virtue
75:14 signal to the world and tell the deep
75:16 state I'm on your side
75:17 now as the president united states
75:19 currently say that NASA landed a man on
75:23 the moon
75:23 American L and landed a guy on the moon
75:25 is a big patriotic speech he does but he
75:30 also when he was talking to the ISS
75:33 folks he asked one of the he was doing
75:37 some live broadcast right was this
75:39 televised thing were Trump sitting his
75:41 office talking to some probably [ __ ]
75:44 composite green-screen whatever and he
75:47 asked me goes well when can we get to
75:48 Mars the human being and get back safely
75:51 Oh sir that's not gonna happen until
75:53 probably the late 2030s at best and the
75:55 estimate right now that I recently read
75:57 was twenty thirty nine how the [ __ ] do
75:59 they know right he goes why why was it
76:02 gonna take so long well sir we gotta
76:04 invent a bunch of technology and doesn't
76:06 it up
76:07 he's sitting there going well we went to
76:08 the moon what's so hard about getting to
76:10 Mars
76:10 well again sir he says what if I gave
76:13 you an infinite budget this is the gist
76:16 of the conversation what if I gave you
76:18 an infinite budget and we could get this
76:20 [ __ ] moving faster give me bring it in
76:22 oh I don't think so it's not supposed to
76:26 happen in anyone's lifetime again let's
76:30 say there's a drug that's going through
76:31 the FDA and they know it's going to
76:34 cause cancer in 20 years
76:36 what's the FDA it's an appointed agency
76:40 by the president United States but he
76:43 gets a recommendation of who he's
76:45 supposed to a point cuz he doesn't know
76:47 everybody he doesn't know who's
76:48 brilliant and who's a shill and all that
76:50 kind of stuff so for the past probably
76:51 40 years since the aspartame went
76:54 through in the Reagan era Reagan was
76:59 told to sign a bunch of guys into the
77:00 FDA and he ended up getting rid of all
77:04 of the good people and brought in all
77:05 the shills who were paid lobbyists prior
77:08 to being these people run the FDA and
77:10 they loud-ass portunity go through a
77:12 complete cancer causing horrible [ __ ]
77:15 diseased thing right I was still
77:18 recently the diet Pepsi removed
77:20 aspartame from their drink I don't know
77:22 what they supposedly replaced it with
77:23 and I don't know if that's true but if
77:24 someone recently told me that I don't
77:26 drink any of that [ __ ] just so you know
77:27 but here's how it works
77:29 how long do you think you're going to
77:31 serve on an FDA board less than 20 years
77:36 less than 20 years so let's say that
77:39 drug turns up eventually causing cancer
77:41 in 20 years again and that's only if
77:44 someone can actually trace it back to
77:46 the drug that's causing this problem
77:48 that's a tall order man and I don't
77:51 think it can be done I do not think it
77:54 could be done but let's just say you
77:56 could there's some smoking gun
77:57 remember the acne cream and the 80s it
77:59 sterilized all those kids I know a guy
78:02 they can't have any kids because his
78:03 parents gave him that stuff they didn't
78:05 know but they were told by the Federal
78:07 Drug Administration that that stuff was
78:09 safe and now you're never a kid loses
78:12 his ability to have children for the
78:14 rest of his life that guy should be
78:16 getting kickbacks from that
78:18 pharmaceutical company for the rest of
78:20 his [ __ ] life
78:21 that's a big loss in his life so the
78:24 reason why this stuff gets pushed
78:26 forward in the NASA organization is for
78:28 the same exact reason the FDA it gets to
78:30 push its cancer causing drugs for it
78:32 they're not gonna be there they're gonna
78:35 be retired they're gonna be Rich's [ __ ]
78:37 when you see people and Monico on those
78:40 big yachts and stuff
78:42 those are your FDA people you see those
78:44 those beautiful houses on the beach on
78:47 the lakes and those guys have big
78:48 [ __ ] pontoons and all the jet skis
78:51 those are the FDA people they took a
78:54 paycheck to push through drug drugs that
78:58 cause horrible side effects and again
79:02 that's only if we catch them
79:03 and this is the way they have run the
79:06 world up until the truth movement up
79:08 until the Great Awakening up until the Q
79:10 movement again regardless accuse true or
79:13 false he is real he is changing the
79:16 planet he's getting people to think he's
79:18 getting people to see the deception so
79:21 he's either the best best truther on
79:23 planet earth running a LARP using real
79:25 facts or he's real and it's something
79:28 else we should pay attention to again
79:30 the guy wouldn't be attacked in the
79:31 press constantly if he was totally fake
79:35 no one's attacking me in the press for
79:37 saying we didn't go to the moon because
79:39 they know that most people still believe
79:40 we did go to the moon but they're doing
79:42 everything they possibly can to
79:43 reinforce this evidence that we win
79:47 anyway I think you feel me if you have
79:51 been a deep thoughts of radio.com please
79:54 go that's where you can change feet so
79:55 if you like video but you want to have
79:57 it in your car or when you jog or when
79:59 you work out or whatever get over to the
80:00 podcast and download those into your
80:03 favorite player there's a podcast link
80:04 straight on the website so your mobile
80:07 device definitely has a podcast player
80:09 go ahead and load it up if you want to
80:12 get into a really fun community
80:13 definitely recommend you get into our
80:15 lockface of a group I mean it is a blast
80:18 it's my favorite place to go constantly
80:21 if you want to donate to the show

80:25 all of the sort of making of stuff you
80:28 can ask me personal questions and I put
80:30 a specific focus on the the patreon
80:33 questions before I go anywhere
80:34 in the world because these people are
80:36 paying for the privilege of information
80:38 Twitter for those of you who don't like
80:40 all the other social media but you love
80:42 Twitter just subscribe to deep thoughts
80:44 radio com you can just look it up deep
80:47 thoughts radio excuse me and there's a
80:48 link straight on the website to it and
80:50 link over there not a tremendous amount
80:52 of conversation because there aren't a
80:54 tremendous amount of followers but
80:55 people are starting to like the videos
80:57 as soon as they go up so I'm starting to
80:58 see some traffic there anyway take care
81:02 of yourself and someone else and I'll
81:03 see you in the next deep thoughts over
81:05 now
