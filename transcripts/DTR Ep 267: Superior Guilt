00:00 [Music]
00:35 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:37 deep thoughts
00:38 I've been brewing this episode for a
00:40 little while because it's just one of
00:45 those things that when you think about
00:47 the subject when you hear the subject
00:48 brought up in various ways it's just one
00:50 of those things that's really
00:51 frustrating we're gonna call this
00:53 episode superior guilt someone trying to
00:57 demonize you for being superior to them
01:00 because there's so many elements to this
01:02 conversation so many truths and
01:05 perspectives to it it's actually it's
01:09 just so hilarious
01:11 in some ways right we have this thing
01:14 going around right now
01:15 in 2018 it's been going on for a couple
01:17 years it's gotten hilarious
01:21 I mean it's truly just hilarious it's
01:24 called white privilege privilege is a
01:28 very interesting word because it's
01:30 trying to not quite say what they're
01:33 trying to say but the math is in right
01:37 the math is in on all these accusations
01:39 if you really want to go there it's
01:41 their race hey you know race does have a
01:47 side correlation to what they're trying
01:50 to talk about but in the end I'm not
01:52 sure race is as involved as one might
01:56 think
01:56 because we find people in all races who
01:59 are geniuses we find them in every
02:02 neighborhood you could be a female
02:05 genius you could be a male genius but
02:09 the have-nots want the haves to feel
02:12 guilty
02:13 and privilege is the insult privilege is
02:18 the insult somehow you got this all
02:20 given to you you got your brain cells
02:23 pre-arranged which does happen in
02:25 genetics right the more that your
02:28 predecessors and your family that gave
02:30 birth to you honed their brains
02:34 dedicated themselves did mess around
02:37 with life got educated went to school or
02:40 you know in a lot of cases college is
02:41 pretty [ __ ] new for human beings to
02:44 be honest alright yeah you've got some
02:45 Greeks and some Romans that went and sat
02:49 on the steps of universities but in
02:51 terms of the average man getting
02:53 educated through a formal university
02:56 what have we got a hundred years maybe I
02:59 mean if it just being an absolute thing
03:02 you have to do but still to this day
03:06 2018
03:07 some of the most incredibly brilliant
03:09 successful creative sweet minded people
03:11 don't have degrees or didn't have them
03:14 when they became what they became so how
03:17 did they get their intelligence well
03:20 they probably have a fairly decent
03:21 genetic line made up of all kinds of
03:26 races Steve Jobs for instance no one
03:31 would ever contest the brilliance of
03:34 Steve Jobs the cleverness the wittiness
03:35 the insightful nacinda see a need that
03:39 needs to be filled and how to fill it
03:41 his minimalist designs of all things
03:44 made Apple what it is today along with
03:46 Steve Wozniak's equal brilliance in
03:49 hardware and software both men came
03:54 together and made an amazing thing
03:55 well what some what Steve Jobs lineage
03:59 what's his race man well he was adopted
04:05 so the people that took care of him in
04:08 Northern California it's Los Altos or
04:11 something like that
04:12 Palo Alto area those aren't his parents
04:16 genetically biologically they're
04:19 definitely his parents spiritually and
04:21 psychologically but his real father was
04:24 Syrian
04:25 hmm Syrian hmm what do we know about
04:30 people from Syria in the 21st century oh
04:32 well they're so underprivileged and so
04:35 whatever but they have to flee to Europe
04:38 to get what they need because they're so
04:41 brilliant right this is the Democratic
04:44 side of things and the EU side of things
04:47 essentially it's it's a back end a way
04:49 of saying they're so ignorant they can't
04:52 run their own country they can't find
04:54 ways to feed themselves to shelter
04:56 themselves so they have to come over to
04:58 Europe and take it away from the the
05:00 white privileged but superiority in an
05:04 individual comes in all different
05:06 flavors doesn't it what the Democrats
05:10 are trying to do is secure
05:12 their vote with the minorities of the
05:16 world not really knowing much about them
05:18 of course the taco truck vote as they
05:20 say right South America has wanted to
05:24 take over North America forever I mean
05:27 for 150 years
05:29 not sure what drives that not sure what
05:32 drives that I've heard the white
05:35 superiority thing in the white privilege
05:37 thing in so many words since I was a
05:40 little kid living in the Midwest living
05:43 on the east coast as a child when my
05:49 father would get to the end of the month
05:50 and we'd have 50 bucks to last us two
05:52 weeks I would hear about how privileged
05:55 we were or how you know we have it all
05:58 spoon-fed to us because we got blonde
05:59 hair and blue eyed babies right I grew
06:03 up in a little tiny town with almost no
06:06 one in there you know ten thousand
06:07 people on average where was the huge
06:13 University where were the professor's
06:17 the fineman's and the Oppenheimer's and
06:20 whatever walking around my street no
06:22 they didn't exist it wasn't like there
06:23 was this oh you're white here's all this
06:25 stuff you get no one forced my uncle to
06:29 learn what he learned that he taught me
06:32 when I had the World Encyclopedia
06:33 delivered to my house no one remotely
06:37 forced me to get in there and start
06:38 studying nuclear physics
06:39 at 9:00 nobody did that nobody forced me
06:43 to learn how to play instruments no one
06:45 forced me to learn how to code at the
06:47 age of 12 when I asked my uncle if I
06:50 could help him draw videogames at 11:00
06:52 and I had to do it in binary
06:54 no one said go help your uncle do this
06:58 this is what you have to do we are white
06:59 to go do that for every white kid I know
07:02 who's really smart I can name 10 that
07:05 are dumb as [ __ ] bag of hammers
07:07 but privilege goes in a bunch of
07:11 different flavors right superiority goes
07:13 a bunch of different flavors let me give
07:15 you a quick example that you can side
07:17 with immediately let's just say you have
07:20 a fairly decent sized family you've got
07:22 three siblings
07:24 you know you and a couple brothers and
07:26 sisters if you're an only child like
07:28 myself you've got some cousin families
07:30 with tons of kids and you will
07:33 undoubtedly know that one of the
07:35 children in the family was the
07:37 best-looking kid the best-looking boy
07:41 the best-looking girl and you said you
07:44 sat and you watched over time as that
07:47 individual because whatever their shape
07:49 size and sculpture of their face
07:51 happened to match the current day
07:53 definition of beauty and sex and
07:55 whatever they sailed through life or
07:58 their sailing through life perhaps
08:01 they'll let their beauty give them alkyl
08:06 aids to a point where they don't have to
08:08 study in school so they're dumb as hell
08:09 but they're good-looking
08:11 well the nerdy kid off on the side
08:15 studies her ass off or his ass off
08:17 because they don't have that facial
08:19 feature to rely on to create an income
08:22 I've known maternal twins boy girl and
08:27 boy boy where one of them just clicked
08:32 with some piece of technology would
08:35 there be a piano or a computer or a
08:37 baseball bat they clicked harder than
08:39 the other sibling the other identical
08:41 one identical not Montague Ozzie twin
08:43 but just the other twin they came out
08:45 just moments later or even a couple
08:46 minutes before a couple seconds before
08:48 and they resentment starts right I've
08:52 personally experienced
08:53 you know parents that are envious of my
08:58 accomplishments at times and you know
09:02 one of whom struggled real hard with it
09:04 and would sort of sabotage everything
09:06 that I did I saw that I saw the child in
09:09 the adult and went oh my god this is
09:11 crazy I got a baby for a parent a
09:16 jealous baby and in the moment did you
09:20 work really really hard to become
09:21 superior at something really talented
09:25 really knowledgeable you know that the
09:30 only thing that the other people have to
09:32 do who are envious of what you have is
09:34 get off their [ __ ] ass and go do
09:36 something about it right in today's
09:41 generation everybody wants Fame for
09:43 doing absolutely nothing well I want
09:46 that I want that therefore I should have
09:48 that and if you tell me I can't have
09:50 that right now well I'm not gonna listen
09:51 to you I'm gonna go listen to all the
09:53 other emotional people around me that
09:54 tell me I can have something without
09:56 actually doing anything to get it
09:57 without actually becoming special or
09:59 superior in any way shape or form to the
10:01 rest of the population musical
10:04 instruments are very interesting in this
10:05 realm because when you pick up a guitar
10:09 especially a guitar after watching
10:13 someone like Buckethead ripped the [ __ ]
10:16 out of a Les Paul in the most funky way
10:19 in the most metal way in the most ballad
10:21 way and you just watch his hands on the
10:24 next you like oh god he makes it look
10:26 easy sometimes you get yourself your
10:29 guitar and you sit down you go I am
10:31 totally dedicated man I'm gonna do at
10:33 least an hour a day right to match his
10:36 eight hours a day or 12 hours a day of
10:37 playing and you get in there and you
10:40 realize that the level of technique is
10:42 insane how you press down the strings on
10:45 the neck how you pluck them with your
10:46 right hand if you're right-handed and
10:49 learning all of your chords and learning
10:51 all your progressions and trying to
10:53 figure out what the Masters have done
10:54 before you you start to sweat and you
10:57 start to go oh [ __ ] this is way way more
11:00 that I have time for depending on what
11:03 age you are I think you know 95 to
11:06 7% of the population that gets in a
11:08 situation similar to that one they
11:11 understand and they concede that other
11:13 they're gonna have to dedicate
11:14 themselves to hell of a lot more to this
11:17 art to get there or they simply put the
11:19 guitar in the wall and go alright it was
11:23 a neat little fantasy I needed to try
11:24 now I know why but Godhead is amazing
11:27 but there's that ranty group of utter
11:31 [ __ ] children who do the equivalent
11:34 of the of the way you know the baby
11:37 that's just crying and crying because
11:40 they just can't have what they want
11:42 instantaneously it's not a matrix neo
11:44 plug in the back of the head and I know
11:46 kung fu moment and so then but in some
11:50 of them coward lessly continue to look
11:52 around for the shortcut i mean knock
11:55 yourself out if you can learn how to
11:56 play guitar in two days the illusion
11:59 today is that there is a concerted
12:01 effort around the world to even the
12:03 playing field with everyone to balance
12:05 the haves and the have-nots it is a
12:08 ludicrous goal to begin with in an
12:12 instantaneous manner right no one has to
12:18 physically move from point A to point B
12:20 to become more intelligent you don't
12:25 everyone in the world has a cell phone
12:27 and I mean everyone has a cell phone if
12:31 they do not have a cell phone
12:32 that'll be the easiest thing that
12:34 mankind could do just give someone a
12:36 cell phone
12:37 now obviously cell phones cause cancer
12:39 and the towers cost more cancer and 5g
12:41 is gonna [ __ ] us all up but other than
12:43 that we could give them some means of
12:46 electronic access to paperwork that they
12:50 could read and learn in their native
12:52 language right moving them from Africa
12:55 to New York or Syria to New York and
12:59 putting them up in a big pin house is
13:00 not going to fix anything the reason why
13:04 I'm recording in my garage today is
13:05 because the house behind my house was
13:09 rented by a family from I guess a non
13:15 privileged part of the world and they
13:18 lived there for a couple years
13:20 they so destroyed the house inside
13:22 because of their primitive nature that
13:25 the house has been under reconstruction
13:26 for six months whoever owns that house
13:30 is losing the monthly nut and they've
13:33 been losing it for six months they've
13:36 had to gut and rebuild every single room
13:38 they have cut enough wood back there to
13:40 basically tear the house down to the
13:42 studs and build it back up but the
13:44 family lived there lived in Huntington
13:46 Beach California you mean to tell me
13:49 there was some huge physical constraint
13:52 for them to get educated to treat a
13:54 house the way it should be treated no
13:58 it's a cultural thing it's a cultural
14:02 value system of what is important in
14:04 life if you don't value intelligence and
14:08 skills and perhaps some sort of
14:11 etiquette and rapport with the neighbors
14:14 around you well then I guess whatever
14:17 you are today is whatever you're gonna
14:18 be I grew up in a town where at least
14:21 30% of the men you use a spoon like a
14:25 caveman all right they put it like this
14:28 and they shovel that [ __ ] in their mouth
14:30 and when you mentioned it to him they'll
14:32 just say it don't matter my family it
14:35 was a little bit more refined they they
14:38 looked at that process and said Wow okay
14:40 maybe if you're a little kid you can
14:42 your your your your hands are teeny the
14:44 utensils huge and you're building your
14:46 motor skills so let you go maybe a
14:48 couple of years but once you're around
14:50 five you're gonna start holding your
14:51 silverware properly my father was on my
14:53 house probably round three I am so glad
14:56 he was on my ass but was my dad mr.
14:59 Rockefeller jr. mr. Rothschild Lord
15:03 Rothschild jr. no he was broke as a
15:07 goddamn joke trying to make ends meet
15:09 realizing well at least the one thing I
15:11 can give my child
15:12 is a little bit of etiquette a good
15:16 vocabulary and some manners how much
15:20 does that cost how much superior
15:22 genetics in your brain do you need to
15:25 just simply pass down common decency
15:26 later in my 30s I was hanging out with
15:30 Robert alone the comedian
15:32 and he and I would do all these sessions
15:35 together and I watched him do the
15:39 British methodology of fork and knife
15:41 and I said man that's really interesting
15:43 you don't switch hands and he goes yeah
15:46 you know this just lets you kind of stay
15:48 steady with what you're doing then I
15:50 asked him across dinner said how do you
15:51 do it how do you eat like that how do
15:54 you work that fork how do you eat peas
15:55 on the back of a fork he said well you
15:58 know you usually don't eat them by
15:59 themselves usually you know use
16:01 something else to to block it and then
16:02 you put some stuff on or you stick it to
16:04 something else like mashed potatoes and
16:05 you work it in and I sat there for an
16:10 entire lunch and ate on the back of my
16:14 fork and now I love it
16:16 I absolutely love it I guess it was all
16:19 that white privilege that made that
16:22 possible right couldn't have possibly
16:23 learned that just being a human being
16:25 right anyone can learn anything in the
16:28 world wherever they are history has
16:31 proven this over and over and over again
16:33 take any region of the world that has
16:35 been repressed by its leaders there was
16:38 always an underground group of folks
16:40 that practice the religion that they
16:42 believed that taught school you know
16:47 when the Spanish French and Arabs
16:49 brought all of the slaves to America the
16:53 black African slaves and dropped them
16:55 off for the you know the oligarchy
16:59 plantation owners who are from Europe
17:02 the handful of them that owned slaves
17:06 right well white people were doing the
17:08 same thing and different plantations the
17:11 slaves got disoriented obviously they
17:14 got reoriented slowly and they began to
17:17 secretly teach each other things that
17:20 they weren't allowed to teach each other
17:22 because the plantation owner didn't want
17:24 them rising up and becoming intelligent
17:26 and realizing that tyranny on any
17:28 microscopic level is still tyranny and
17:31 eventually it led to the point that when
17:33 the blacks were finally starting to be
17:35 freed up in the north and eventually
17:37 freed in the south we have amazing
17:41 inventors and generals and commanders
17:43 there's even
17:45 there was a black president at one point
17:47 in time before George Washington for the
17:48 colonies extremely academic African
17:53 males who didn't natively speak English
17:56 right they had to learn English you know
17:58 over the over the centuries because they
18:02 had their native language ripped away
18:03 obviously by the time any of this
18:06 happened in the 1700s and beyond in the
18:09 native language for their tribes was
18:10 English but let's get back to the theme
18:14 superior guilt all right so you're the
18:19 pretty one in your family you got the
18:21 right body the right face you have the
18:24 dimples your smiles awesome your teeth
18:26 are awesome your body just sort of
18:29 naturally stays in a nice shape oh sure
18:32 you can destroy it if you want to but
18:35 you're about a effort to stay amazing is
18:37 negligible but what if your relatives
18:41 your mother and your father and your
18:44 brothers and your sisters during every
18:46 family function sat around like a bunch
18:49 of Democrats and said you're the outcast
18:53 now and you're like what why am I the
18:58 outcast because you turned out better
19:00 than us better being obviously a
19:03 relative term to the times how would
19:08 that feel if they arbitrarily pick a
19:11 measurement and say that that is the
19:13 measurement by which you are deemed
19:14 superior you are deemed thus privileged
19:18 a lot of black families deal with this
19:21 because a lot of black families in
19:23 America have white blood in them I think
19:27 almost all black families that have been
19:30 here for more than 200 years have white
19:32 blood in them and every once in a while
19:33 that white skin pigmentation surface is
19:37 a little bit more prominent than the
19:39 other siblings and so you'll have a very
19:41 dark sibling and then a fairly light
19:42 brother citizen bear sit light brother
19:46 sibling and they are frowned upon
19:52 Malcolm X talked about this
19:55 Malcolm X talked about having problems
19:58 going into various black communities
20:00 because he was a light-skinned brother
20:01 he got along really well with all races
20:04 probably because of his charm and his
20:06 amazing intelligence was it fair that he
20:10 had to feel the burden of being
20:12 genetically born a particular way just a
20:15 pigmentation on his skin for God's sakes
20:17 and the more he educated himself he was
20:21 Alex Haley's book you know he had a sort
20:24 of the Harlem Street world where he
20:26 became street smart and he was very
20:27 handsome and very physically apt I mean
20:30 he could kick someone's ass he was a
20:32 bookie gets busted goes to jail becomes
20:36 converts to Islam you know does things
20:39 like reads the dictionary reads the
20:40 Quran pops out and becomes Malcolm X the
20:45 guy that we see more prominently in
20:48 history books continues to take
20:51 interview after interview and just as
20:53 stunningly [ __ ] brilliant has the
20:57 perception on racism that is as healthy
21:01 as it possibly could be which means you
21:04 know the most beautiful thing he ever
21:05 said was I'd rather have a white man
21:07 tell me that he's a racist than to look
21:10 me in the face and lied to me but he
21:15 accepts me when he doesn't going down
21:17 that line a little bit further you got
21:19 Martin Luther King I don't think anyone
21:23 would argue he is a handsome bloke and
21:25 for the rest of recorded history as long
21:28 as his speeches remain documented in in
21:31 tomes for us to read and forever future
21:34 of mankind he will be regarded as one of
21:38 the most brilliant human beings to ever
21:40 be conceived and born and live on this
21:43 planet the speeches that he gave were
21:46 off-the-cuff just pulled out of his mind
21:50 every word profound every single
21:54 sentence relating to the next the
21:56 overall theme an arc of what he was
21:58 saying was profound and important but
22:01 what if everyone said in the black
22:03 community look at that smartass brother
22:09 you know he's walking around he's
22:11 exuding his big brain you know I don't
22:13 even say exhuming you know he's showing
22:14 off his big brain and we just hate him
22:17 for that because we'd ever got a brain
22:18 that big and they shot him down before
22:22 he ever had a chance to make the impact
22:24 that he made doctor say segregation
22:26 could probably still be going on today
22:28 if that man wasn't allowed to do what he
22:30 did but today it is rooted against the
22:33 white man right Eddie Murphy did a
22:36 really funny bit where he dressed up
22:40 like a white guy and they did this skit
22:43 and I think James Chappelle did
22:44 something very similar to this
22:46 he was Dave Chappelle's version that was
22:48 more poignant but the he went to a bank
22:51 and he applied for a loan because he was
22:52 white the bank the loan officer was just
22:55 turning down a black man before when he
22:57 walks in the room who had all of his
22:59 credentials and all of his collateral
23:00 and he says I'm just sorry I can't give
23:02 you this loan you know makes up some
23:03 excuse and then he sits down and they
23:06 just opened the drawer and give him tens
23:08 of thousands of dollars in stacked cash
23:10 and they said oh don't even worry about
23:11 paying it back wink wink
23:14 and what they were trying to say was
23:16 this doesn't happen not that it does
23:19 happen and I think what's interesting is
23:22 before the internet one could really get
23:24 a pretty decent ego because you didn't
23:28 have the ability to reach out into the
23:29 world and say am i the best how good am
23:35 I as an artist as a programmer as
23:38 whatever the hell you are a singer but
23:41 now you get on the internet and whatever
23:42 you do it has been my experience that
23:45 you can find someone insanely better
23:48 than you and it's humbling and it's
23:52 healthy but let's turn the tables just a
23:54 little bit here for a second what if
23:58 every time you went to school a college
24:01 especially let's say you really lose it
24:02 as a human being and you're like man I
24:04 really need to know this information and
24:06 you search the world for the finest mind
24:09 you can find to teach you what you need
24:11 to know male female doesn't matter what
24:15 you are but you need to know something
24:17 and you have literally been on this
24:20 pilgrimage for a long
24:22 time and you walk into the room and
24:25 you're so pleased they're there and
24:26 they're sitting at their desk maybe
24:28 they're just kind of cinching up their
24:30 papers to take off to the next class or
24:33 get ready for the next class and you're
24:35 just about to have the conversation
24:37 you're like madam sir I have been
24:40 searching the world for you to give me
24:42 the information that I need I want to
24:44 take your classes I want to have a quick
24:46 conversation with you as to which class
24:47 I want I need to take to find out this
24:49 exact piece of information and the
24:51 conversation goes about four sentences
24:54 has it even reached a minute and all
24:58 these [ __ ] that run around with
24:59 their white privilege [ __ ] rush in
25:02 the back of the room and Lynch the
25:06 person that you have just found to get
25:09 the information you need to become
25:11 intelligent to become more intelligent
25:13 and let's just say that you aren't white
25:17 and you're trying to better yourself
25:20 let's just go with this ridiculous
25:22 assertion that white people have all the
25:24 information that you need which is
25:25 [ __ ] okay you don't go to a major
25:30 university and you walk in every room
25:31 and every teacher is white I mean it's
25:33 just ridiculous well let's go with the
25:35 stupid assertion but they Lynch your
25:39 professor and they take them away and
25:42 burn them at the stake because of their
25:44 mob rules idiotic brains and you whoever
25:49 you are or robbed forever of getting
25:52 that information because he got burned
25:55 at the stake by a bunch of have-nots
25:57 perhaps that person walking in the door
26:01 is from Uganda Cameroon and they have
26:07 finally figured out what is keeping
26:08 those countries from being first world
26:10 countries and they're like oh my god if
26:11 I just get this one piece of information
26:13 from someone who understands first world
26:15 countries I can transform my own country
26:17 I don't want to stay in your country I
26:19 just want to stay long enough to get
26:21 educated and go home and bring that
26:23 beautiful wealth of information to my
26:27 people but there's a lynch mob out there
26:30 trying to undermine everyone with this
26:35 of the draw information hopefully right
26:38 away you have a knee-jerk reaction
26:40 against the analogy because you're
26:42 saying to yourself that's [ __ ]
26:43 there's plenty of geniuses in every
26:45 culture and every race and then you
26:49 would have to like me get to the point
26:52 where the assertion of white privilege
26:53 is simply something that's been
26:55 fictionally made up to demonize the
26:59 progress what's the deal with fat
27:01 shaming these days what's the deal with
27:05 that right well one person has no
27:07 discipline with their eating habits and
27:09 therefore becomes obese or morbidly
27:12 obese and they never want to be called
27:16 out on it
27:16 because they obviously look at them and
27:18 they don't feel proud of themselves and
27:20 I'm not talking about full-figured
27:22 people who are big people right when a
27:25 woman is six foot tall
27:27 she is and proportionate they may be
27:30 voluptuous it's a different algorithm
27:33 that what we're talking about we're
27:34 talking about someone who's maybe five -
27:35 but they're three feet wide
27:38 guys with gigantic pop bellies they're
27:43 suffering physically trust me they have
27:46 all kinds of problems they have
27:48 hemorrhoids because they weigh too much
27:49 they don't breathe very well they
27:51 haven't seen their genitalia in years
27:53 they can't bend down to tie their shoes
27:55 very basic things going the restroom is
27:58 the chore but those are those of us who
28:01 can take care of our weight we still
28:04 struggle you know you hibernate in the
28:06 winter you put some on you and you cut
28:08 it off in spring that's what I'm doing
28:09 right now we're living in this moronic
28:12 loop of cognitive dissonance and it's
28:14 trying to sort of spiral up like
28:16 frosting on a cake right when you're
28:18 making an ice cream cone you have to go
28:19 in circles and circles and it just keeps
28:20 building a building until there's that
28:22 little swirl on the top we're still in
28:24 the rapidly accelerating phase of lunacy
28:28 and idiocy right now and the saddest
28:31 part is that we're allowing this stuff
28:33 to take root in legislation around the
28:35 world seventy two genders are you
28:37 [ __ ] kidding me you know the only way
28:40 to get up to those numbers is you know
28:41 the guy that wants to sit at home at 48
28:43 years old and live in a diaper while
28:45 some family wipes his ass every day
28:47 that's
28:48 Enderman somebody wants a dress in furry
28:50 outfit that's a gender that's a weird
28:53 [ __ ] thing you're doing on top of
28:54 your gender body we have orientation
28:57 differences that is something a little
29:00 more concrete a man likes a man a woman
29:03 likes a woman those are concrete
29:05 decisions about how they want to live
29:06 the rest of their lives we call the
29:09 other things fetishes for decades and
29:13 decades and decades
29:14 I was once renting a room further people
29:19 I used to go to church with these were
29:21 church elders they're pretty progressive
29:23 folks you know and I was talking to the
29:25 mother and it was during the nineties
29:26 when the grunge was just starting to hit
29:28 around 1990-91 and I forget the woman's
29:32 name but she was a very popular singer
29:33 for a very short period of time
29:35 she was the white privilege girl from
29:37 Seattle and she made some raunchy lyrics
29:42 and you know she wasn't using any dirty
29:45 language but the things that she was
29:46 talking about were a little seedy for a
29:49 church community regardless of how
29:51 liberal you are I hated the music so I
29:54 never played it but her kids were
29:55 playing it and she eventually called it
29:56 out and said you know I don't know if I
29:57 want that played in my house and I
30:02 looked at her with a sympathetic face I
30:03 said yeah I know what you're saying you
30:05 know but think about it we've had this
30:07 sort of lyrics pretty much since the 50s
30:13 you know there's a lot of metaphorical
30:15 sexy stuff in the 40s and 30s as well
30:17 but they just kept it so far out there
30:20 in metaphor that never really offended
30:22 anyone the kids didn't understand it
30:24 anyway but I just took a split second to
30:28 explain to her my view on it which was
30:31 that you know this is where kids are
30:34 today and you know if the parents
30:36 rejected then the kids reject the
30:37 parents and it's just well he's nasty
30:39 little loops and she just looked at me
30:41 and she said not in my house my house
30:46 doesn't have that I get to choose what's
30:49 in my home as a frequency for my
30:50 children to to learn and to listen to
30:54 and become a part of she goes I don't
30:57 want my kids feeding their brains this
30:59 stuff and she said it much
31:01 terms much better you know phraseology
31:05 I'm paraphrasing her poorly but there
31:08 was a moment there if I could videotape
31:10 my face in reaction to her face it would
31:12 be a priceless moment where yours truly
31:14 went oh yeah you can actually do that
31:18 you can actually police what you take
31:23 into your home what's beautiful about
31:25 living in California is that I'm
31:27 surrounded by a bunch of different
31:28 cultures and races and I get to know
31:31 them I get to know their fathers and
31:33 their mothers and their sons and their
31:35 daughters the groups that are trying to
31:37 manipulate minorities into loyalty of a
31:40 political of a particular political
31:42 party are the groups that only benefit
31:44 if they can generalize an entire race
31:47 and I can't imagine anything more racist
31:50 than that when someone calls all white
31:54 people white trash it obviously angers
32:00 or at least turns the eyebrow of a lot
32:04 of us white folks that are like really
32:06 you think all of us are like that but
32:10 they want all Mexicans to be Mexicans
32:12 right they all Drive taco trucks and
32:14 they all over populate and they're all
32:16 frenetically macho and pop up about
32:19 whatever slangy thing they can say about
32:22 the latin-american
32:25 races they just wanted all lumped into
32:27 one generalization and why is that
32:30 because they can control them better
32:32 they can control them better and it
32:35 could be the point where you walk up to
32:36 say someone who's not like that within
32:39 the latin-american origin and say well
32:42 if you will become this stereotype and
32:45 this generalization of which this
32:47 Democratic Party wants you to be a part
32:49 of then you can get things for free and
32:52 then it comes right down to the
32:54 self-respect and dignity of that
32:56 individual to say yes or no okay I guess
33:01 I'll you know it sounds good you know
33:03 I'm kind of going through a little tight
33:04 spot of my finances I guess I'll do that
33:06 so I get some welfare or the person will
33:09 say like most of people I know
33:12 [ __ ] you men
33:14 I work hard I'm gonna continue working
33:16 hard what I have is mine and what I have
33:18 is because of my own accomplishment the
33:21 last thing I want on earth is you to
33:23 think you controlled me because you
33:25 don't but sadly that's not how the world
33:28 works right sadly there are large
33:33 majorities of the surface of this earth
33:35 that house populations that have been
33:37 utterly and completely repressed more so
33:40 in last hundred years there are a lot of
33:43 videos going around today
33:46 in fact some of you have seen this of
33:48 Iran back in the 60s where women didn't
33:51 wear burqas women could drive women were
33:53 brilliant women were scientists and all
33:55 these other things and it was after the
33:57 infiltration of the the banking
33:59 oligarchy the World Bank if they went in
34:03 there and put people in charge that then
34:06 brought back things like Sharia law
34:08 putting women back inside burkas
34:11 teaching them down to the core of their
34:14 consciousness that to do anything other
34:15 than be this way is blasphemy to Allah
34:20 and so they agreed to it for a little
34:23 while until they start seeing the rest
34:26 of the world be a little more free some
34:28 of them swear by it they want to keep
34:31 that tradition others are like get out
34:36 of my way men I'm smart I deserve the
34:41 privilege of being a human being right
34:43 the Republic your inalienable rights
34:46 because you were alive as a human being
34:48 we know that the level of intelligence
34:51 around the world varies drastically
34:54 intelligence is obviously a relative
34:56 thing you have what I think is academic
34:58 intelligence which is probably the most
35:00 widely varied metric that one can judge
35:04 a particular group by and then you have
35:07 wisdom the things that keep you happy in
35:10 life and that I think varies a lot less
35:13 and I would like to suggest that those
35:16 with the higher academic brilliance have
35:17 a less wisdom and those with lower
35:20 academic brilliance have a higher wisdom
35:23 not always the case there's always
35:25 exceptions there's always a you know a
35:27 gradient of the
35:28 these two factors coming together but
35:31 what is the little kernel inside the
35:32 human mind that activates or is
35:35 activated by these political groups that
35:37 try to go in and usurp the very
35:40 existence of these individuals right do
35:45 they want to run giant corporations and
35:47 have the labor force be a bunch of you
35:50 know folks that don't know what they are
35:51 what they are worth on a daily basis so
35:53 they pay them the bare minimum and
35:55 exploit them with long hours but no
35:57 overpay no time-and-a-half no double pay
36:00 none of that stuff the feeling is that
36:03 you're you're being taken advantage of
36:07 and the circular logic and the irony of
36:12 this whole thing is is that the person
36:14 that comes in and says you're being had
36:15 by people with white privilege is
36:18 actually in the act of taking you for
36:21 everything right taking an individual
36:24 and really pulling the greatest scam on
36:27 planet Earth on that person I have a
36:30 very close friend of mine who's of Latin
36:32 descent he is more of the Aztec family
36:34 his family was on this side of the
36:37 border the United States when the border
36:39 closed and so his family was never one
36:41 that had to migrate from south to north
36:44 his family has endured major major cases
36:48 of racism from his own kind as he puts
36:51 it because he was on this side of the
36:53 border same bloodline he could talk face
36:56 to face with another Aztec descendent
36:58 the same exact blood distribution of
37:00 quote/unquote race and he says his
37:05 opinion to me was that he goes people
37:09 south of the border are the most racist
37:11 people I've ever met on the planet they
37:14 can't even look someone in the face with
37:15 the same bloodline and find any kinship
37:19 and he goes it's brought down by the
37:22 government it's brought down by the
37:24 educational systems that teach them that
37:26 that if there's any suffering in the
37:28 world and there always is in all of our
37:30 lives that it's because of someone else
37:34 right the Kenneth Burke scapegoat theory
37:38 my stepfather has a PhD in critical
37:40 literature and did his piece
37:42 thesis on Kenneth Burke he wrote a book
37:43 on Kenneth Burke so I had a beautiful
37:48 education on Kenneth Burke again the guy
37:51 comes from a non wealthy family simply
37:54 decided to become smart invested in his
37:56 own intelligence and therefore got a PhD
37:59 alright no silver spoons by the way a
38:05 footnote about silver spoon references
38:07 the silver spoon is related to the fact
38:09 that silver colloidal silver in general
38:11 as a healing agent for the human body
38:13 and so I'm one of the reasons why they
38:14 gave babies silver spoons is to feed
38:19 them a light source of silver through
38:22 the spoon so they become healthy so even
38:26 if you were broke the house usually had
38:28 one baby silver spoon with Kenneth Burke
38:31 was a genius I've talked about him a
38:32 long time ago on the show his take on
38:36 education was he went to the
38:38 universities and said you know what this
38:41 education sucks so he asked his father
38:44 to give him all the money that he was
38:48 gonna give him to go to college and he
38:49 said let me sit at home while I use the
38:51 money to pay rent
38:52 I'll buy the same books and I will
38:54 simply educate myself but I'll do it
38:57 much faster and then I will go ahead and
38:59 continue my own research and become
39:03 noted in the academic communities for
39:06 something very special very unique and
39:09 one of his great contributions to life
39:10 mini there's many things that Kenneth
39:13 Burke put put out there the power of
39:15 language for one what you speak is what
39:17 shapes your mind it shapes you as an
39:19 individual it might be linked over to
39:23 just for those of you looking for an
39:24 example in your mind there's a lot of
39:26 articles written out to say that people
39:29 who swear occasionally are much happier
39:31 and more intelligent to people that
39:32 don't one thing to Kenneth Burke
39:35 pioneered was the scapegoat theory
39:37 it was something and everyone understood
39:39 scapegoating is what the mob does right
39:41 the haves and the have-nots scapegoating
39:44 is a process and scapegoating has a
39:47 result a shift in the mind that is you
39:50 could argue healthy for the mind before
39:53 I go into Kenneth let me just tell you a
39:54 psychological
39:56 that we have studied for decades and
39:58 decades and decades and it is if a
40:01 person constantly blames something else
40:03 other than themselves for all their
40:05 mistakes the weird thing is is that at
40:08 least from a success standpoint and a
40:11 wealth standpoint they're more
40:13 successful than people who constantly
40:14 take it onto themselves it's a weird
40:18 thing because you wouldn't want to teach
40:20 your kids to do that right you need to
40:21 accept what you've done wrong so you can
40:24 fix it and then live a more blissful
40:26 natural homogeneous life with your
40:29 surroundings that you can become
40:31 successful through working through it
40:33 right but the first thing that Kenneth
40:35 Burke pioneered was essentially the
40:39 refinement of the scapegoat theory as it
40:40 relates to individuals small small
40:43 groups scape going an individual or an
40:45 individual scapegoating something else
40:47 it could be an inanimate object you know
40:49 the weather was the reason why I didn't
40:52 make this thing happen and therefore I
40:53 fail but it wasn't my fault it was the
40:54 weather and we know that happens right
40:57 there's plenty of f1 races that have
40:59 been won due to weather by various teams
41:01 and that was that level of scapegoating
41:04 I think was something that man just went
41:06 yeah yeah yeah it's kind of like Darwin
41:07 stupid theory of survival of fittest you
41:10 know we all knew this from all for all
41:12 time insects know that one right
41:13 but the bigger one was the sociological
41:17 version of his theory which is that
41:20 large groups scapegoat other large
41:25 groups or individuals as to why they
41:27 have suffering in their life I think
41:30 it's fairly well known although not very
41:32 well acknowledged that when you wake up
41:36 and you have a heartbeat you could get
41:39 off your ass and do something more
41:41 productive with your day you could learn
41:42 something I don't care if you have kids
41:45 a busy life you sit on toilets you have
41:49 telephones you've got a minute or two
41:51 where you're not doing something and you
41:53 could use that time to get what you need
41:55 right okay if you are in the area of the
42:00 world where you have unfortunately by
42:03 being a good person a larger country to
42:06 be taken over by some financial coup
42:09 replacing your leadership
42:10 which then gets to the educational
42:12 access that you have to become
42:15 intelligent to get what you want to find
42:18 out what you want right you can have all
42:19 the wisdom in the world to be a happy
42:21 family but you can't pay your bills
42:22 money is one of the most evil things on
42:25 planet earth when it comes to being
42:27 happy because it is this bone cut
42:32 crushing pressure on all the citizens of
42:34 your home the little kids well they get
42:37 accused of being unappreciative of food
42:42 and clothing and stuff you know
42:45 Playstations the kid can't get enough
42:46 PlayStation games you can't get a fancy
42:49 enough cell phone their clothing isn't
42:51 fancy enough when they go to school and
42:53 the other kids make fun of them and the
42:55 parents send their going kid I'm doing
42:57 the best I can
42:58 right but the child has no conception of
43:02 what it's like to make money so build a
43:05 whole family out of that problem which
43:07 happens in all races all around the
43:09 world from time to time if you're a
43:12 minority in America which means you're a
43:15 might jerk majority where you come from
43:17 or that person comes from then you can
43:21 have someone walk in the room and say
43:22 you know why you don't have what you
43:24 need it's because of the white man the
43:28 white man is the reason why you don't
43:30 have what you have and some of you might
43:34 say well you just mentioned the coup
43:35 algorithm well we know that white
43:37 bankers did that the diary's of an
43:40 economic hitman that book talks all
43:42 about white men going in and taking over
43:44 all of South America hmm okay but who
43:50 did the coup who did the coup was a
43:54 bunch of white guys taking over Ecuador
43:58 Guatemala it was a bunch of citizens
44:02 that fell for this scapegoating theory
44:05 that said yeah you're right I'll take a
44:07 little bit of money I'll rush the City
44:10 Hall we'll drag that guy out and cut his
44:12 head off or whatever at least get on a
44:14 plane and leave and we'll put this who
44:18 we're gonna put in office oh yeah who
44:19 who the white man says is a good leader
44:22 it's part of the deal
44:24 they pick our new leader and he or she
44:26 is of the native country so these
44:30 questions are taken over by their own
44:31 kind
44:32 and then the repression started the IMF
44:35 bank loans come in within a year to a
44:40 year and a half those bank loans can
44:41 never be paid back as that's how they're
44:43 designed and all the mineral rights and
44:44 everything in that particular country is
44:46 usurped by European bankers who do you
44:50 have to blame in America is currently
44:53 fighting the same war that everyone else
44:55 is fighting the white man is fighting
44:56 the same war that every other race is
44:59 fighting around the world the only
45:01 difference is as the white man really
45:03 doesn't have anyone to blame
45:04 we're perceived as the tippy tippy top
45:07 of the whole intellectual spear right I
45:10 don't think it's absolutely true but
45:13 that's the perception that white people
45:15 have even have of themselves yeah you
45:18 know white people in California or Texas
45:20 might be able to say oh what's all these
45:21 Mexicans coming across the border that
45:23 are taking our jobs okay white man you
45:26 want a moment on you're gonna build all
45:29 the houses and the skyscrapers in the
45:30 local area I don't find a lot of my
45:33 white buddies lining up for those jobs
45:35 and I'm not personally convinced that if
45:38 you could take every single
45:39 quote-unquote illegal alien out of
45:40 America that all of a sudden these white
45:42 people are going to return to all these
45:43 jobs they haven't done those jobs in
45:46 years in the Midwest it's still that way
45:50 people own lawnmowers for one thing and
45:52 they mow their own lawns but even if
45:54 they hire a young teenage kid out of
45:56 high school to mow their lawn for them
45:57 which is what I did as a kid yeah
46:00 they're white kids they do it it's a
46:02 transitional job it's what you do as a
46:04 teenager it's never perceived to be a
46:07 job that you're supposed to do at 50
46:10 years old by time you hit 18 some other
46:13 kid who's 14 is taking over your job
46:15 because you're running off to college
46:16 you're gonna start your life but in my
46:18 neighborhood the Mexicans that mow our
46:20 lawns are in their 40s and 50s sure
46:23 there's a few 20 year-olds here and
46:24 there but there's a hierarchy you can
46:26 tell the older guys are in charge and
46:28 the younger kids are doing what they're
46:29 told the one place where superiority is
46:34 there's a few but the one place that
46:37 it's really
46:38 weird is within a company it's also
46:42 revered within a university but within a
46:45 company there's a reality that
46:48 universities don't have which is making
46:50 money those who can make money for the
46:53 corporation for the company be a little
46:55 tiny mom-and-pop shop could be a giant
46:57 giant corporation no matter where you
47:01 are in the corporation there's usually a
47:03 technology involved whether it be baking
47:06 a cake or making a huge computer a
47:09 microchip or something those who are in
47:12 say technical support know that they're
47:14 probably not academically capable of
47:17 walking into R&D and becoming an
47:19 engineer and so they think they're lucky
47:21 stars that with their minimum amount of
47:22 intelligence to answer the phone and
47:24 guide people through problems they're
47:26 able to collect a paycheck go home have
47:28 a wonderful night with their family
47:30 hopefully and a great weekend maybe a
47:32 vacation or two a year and it's what
47:34 they do and they respect the fact that
47:37 there are people that dedicated
47:38 themselves to knowing more people who
47:42 are creative and technical at the same
47:44 time typically are at the apex kernel
47:48 nucleus of a company they're the ones
47:50 that said oh I found a need and I made
47:52 an iPod enjoy the billions of dollars
47:55 paying your pension in your salary as
47:58 soon as you pop out of that paradigm all
48:01 of a sudden there's consequences for
48:03 being intelligent there's penalties I've
48:08 been involved in situations within the
48:10 last couple of years where I have been
48:12 working on some very intense technology
48:14 and urban environments been in
48:17 environments where there were
48:19 individuals that were building other
48:22 things around me that were more meat
48:25 potatoes like structures and that sort
48:27 of thing they're they're fascinating me
48:30 with their capability of laying drywall
48:32 of cutting a carpet of repairing a wall
48:36 that just got bumped by someone you know
48:38 not looking where they were going and
48:40 they make it look like it was brand-new
48:42 can't even tell but I've had situations
48:45 where these individuals will kind of be
48:47 looking at what I'm doing you know with
48:48 some other folks that are doing the same
48:49 thing and they're like there
48:51 of looking and then when they see you
48:53 looking at them you get one of two
48:55 responses you get this huh well what are
48:58 you doing you know explain it to me and
48:59 then I've seen folks kind of oh I don't
49:02 care about what you do I don't care what
49:04 you do a defense mechanism kicks in now
49:09 I'm the type of guy to grab every single
49:10 one of them I'd say come here let me
49:13 show you what we're doing it's pretty
49:15 cool right and they'll go yeah and I
49:17 break down that barrier and they're like
49:19 I say okay well I know this looks really
49:20 complicated I mean let me tell you what
49:23 these things do
49:23 this does that this does that this is
49:25 how this is put together all these
49:26 different things and all of a sudden
49:30 their eyes are huge one I broke down
49:33 this barrier between the two of us but
49:35 I'm smart and they're not I make sure
49:38 that they understand that I revere what
49:39 they do and they get to say whatever
49:41 they want about what I'm doing but in
49:42 the end I say look I know this looks
49:44 complicated and definitely some
49:45 brilliant people made these pieces and
49:48 parts that we're using here but a lot of
49:49 its off-the-shelf if you wanted the job
49:52 I'm doing right now you could do it and
49:56 as soon as that those those little
49:59 triggers start switching in their brain
50:01 they start saying oh my god this guy is
50:04 not quaffing this horrible superiority
50:07 on me in fact he's sort of saying I
50:10 could do exactly what he's doing they
50:12 woke up that morning thinking oh my god
50:13 there's this complicated stuff going on
50:15 where I'm at work my time they go to bed
50:17 that night they're like wow I could make
50:18 a career change with very little effort
50:21 I could learn how to do what they do I
50:23 know a kid who who welds for SpaceX all
50:27 right he's welding beads between steel
50:30 holding them together he has to be
50:33 amazing at what he does because those
50:34 those welding points have to hold these
50:37 for the illusion of the launch right he
50:39 doesn't know how the booster rockets
50:42 work he doesn't know how the AI works he
50:44 doesn't know how the launch sequence
50:45 works there's no anything but he feels
50:48 fine being what he is contributing at
50:51 his level and he knows that if he went
50:52 back to school and learn aerospace he
50:55 could get into those other areas why
50:58 he's got the privilege of working for
50:59 the company they can give him the job
51:02 and he's not white by the way the
51:05 reality of life is that very few people
51:08 on this planet there are groups that
51:11 have this problem but I would say in a
51:16 high high 90 percentile rating of this
51:19 world they have access to information
51:22 and they can make the decision to go for
51:28 I think I said an episode about five
51:32 episodes back you know go look up your
51:34 heroes male or female and find out what
51:38 underprivileged families they grew up in
51:40 and the fact that they took that that
51:43 problem of not having enough resources
51:45 to do what they want with life and they
51:48 said enough of this I'm gonna go get
51:52 that extra thing and they educated
51:54 themselves they got a talent they got a
51:57 trade skill and they pulled themselves
52:00 up out of the bowels of their world and
52:02 they went and succeeded what I want you
52:05 to do is if you have worked really
52:06 really hard to be special in anything in
52:09 life you could just simply be the best
52:10 parent don't allow anyone to guilt-trip
52:15 you for your investment don't allow
52:19 anyone to guilt-trip you for living in a
52:22 world where you simply weren't repressed
52:24 if you commit crimes to get where you
52:27 are well that's what you can feel guilty
52:29 about right I've been extremely lucky in
52:32 my life luck is hard work makes with
52:37 opportunity I have been at the right
52:40 place at the right time with the right
52:42 skills to move into industries to help
52:44 people to be to befriend people to do
52:47 things that very few people have done
52:49 all in one person right I was very
52:53 fortunate that when I was younger I was
52:55 sent a collection of cassette tapes
52:57 which I've mentioned a couple of times
52:58 on the show and this dude said one thing
53:00 that kept me out of trouble the for the
53:02 rest of my life and he said don't be the
53:05 guy that comes into the conversation as
53:08 the big know-it-all even if you do know
53:09 the answers and you can correct everyone
53:11 in the conversation I'm saying that's me
53:13 but it's what he said he said don't be
53:15 that guy
53:16 blend in you know really get into the
53:20 moments between the lines of technical
53:22 know-how get into the sociology of the
53:24 beauty of friendships and relationships
53:26 you know have a soul basically my father
53:31 was actually really really good to
53:33 explain to me class reunions I don't
53:36 know that a lot of you don't go to them
53:37 but for those of you who do you'll know
53:39 what I'm saying
53:40 my dad told me he goes you know in the
53:42 first reunion that you have the ten-year
53:45 reunion you're gonna bump into a lot of
53:46 kids they're gonna be bragging about
53:48 what they've done over the last ten
53:51 years they've been very successful they
53:53 are superior in what they do but they
53:55 make it a point to throw it in your face
53:57 he goes you're gonna listen to that crap
53:59 a lot you're gonna find out that no one
54:01 really wants to talk to them and then by
54:03 the 20th anniversary they're calmed down
54:05 they've been humbled by life by the 30th
54:08 you're just happy everyone's alive and
54:10 so on and so forth so when I went to my
54:14 reunion at 27 I'd had this amazing ten
54:17 years of life I mean just phenomenal and
54:20 I had a buddy of mine in school that
54:22 also had a very privileged thing where
54:24 he got the chance to become racecar
54:27 driver
54:28 and the two of us because he and I work
54:31 acquaintances really I wouldn't say we
54:33 were like friends I mean you know I we'd
54:36 ever hung out together anything like
54:37 that but we were very friendly to each
54:39 other and in a bizarre twist he and I
54:44 ended up standing next to each other at
54:45 the end of my tenth reunion talking to
54:48 each other and I said well why aren't
54:49 you hanging out with everyone over there
54:51 he says well because everyone knows I
54:55 race cars and it just becomes about me
54:57 the conversation cannot get to anyone
55:00 else they want to know what I've done
55:01 and I want to know about them and I
55:03 don't really care about my career as
55:05 much as they do I mean I love it but
55:08 it's not what I'm trying to do with this
55:10 10-year reunion I want to see my friends
55:11 and I wasn't personally having that
55:14 problem because no one knew what I did
55:16 which was nice so I got to live in the
55:17 shadows and just kind of go you know I'm
55:19 just saying you know I'm having a good
55:20 time cut for an you know what do you do
55:22 add this little thing here you know it's
55:23 like you know it was fun my buddy was
55:28 feeling guilty
55:30 that he had developed skill he lost out
55:33 on a large part of the reunion because
55:35 he retreated away from the crowd because
55:39 he had this guilt that he had in their
55:43 eyes a better life than they had when
55:46 some of these some of the girls probably
55:48 about five girls I think in my class
55:50 have three kids by 27 and they had
55:55 beautiful things called families he had
55:58 a lot of kids too so he had the family
56:00 and the career right I have an episode
56:03 way back in season one called loving
56:04 yourself I mentioned it a few episodes
56:06 back and it kind of ties into this
56:10 there's this overwhelming guilt if you
56:12 can look in the mirror and say I love
56:14 you you look good it doesn't matter what
56:18 you look like my god whatever this
56:21 clothes came together the hair came
56:22 together if you're a woman the makeup
56:23 came together and you just feel good and
56:28 anyone that demonizes that beauty is an
56:32 [ __ ] whether it be a religious
56:35 organization or society take on things
56:39 you know right now it's it's one of
56:41 these things if a skinny girl goes up on
56:43 a tarmac and models and she looks
56:46 amazing doing it she's a [ __ ] she's a
56:49 horrible but if you know a woman who's
56:52 really overweight goes up and does it
56:53 they say look how courageous she is oh
56:56 boy heap on all of the praise I recently
57:01 saw somewhere in the last six months
57:03 some beauty pageant of some sort or not
57:05 beep I was like modeling show sorry and
57:09 there was one girl that went up who was
57:11 very tall and you could tell she was
57:14 probably 30 40 pounds overweight and the
57:18 coverage of this event was all focused
57:20 on the big girl the really thick girl
57:23 and I mean we couldn't figure out what
57:26 any of the other fashion line looked
57:27 like because all they kept doing was
57:29 going back to the big girl totally
57:32 totally erasing the point of the show
57:35 which was to say this fashion designers
57:37 worked their ass off to create this line
57:38 of clothing let's look at it now it
57:41 became this whole thing of hey girls out
57:43 there
57:43 you should get totally overweight most
57:46 girls aren't six feet tall so if you're
57:49 overweight and they're praising those
57:51 girls overweight and putting fat shaming
57:54 in there to make sure you can't well
57:58 then you can just get overweight and
58:01 you'll deal with all the physical
58:02 troubles of that and if you're not six
58:04 feet tall to distribute that weight
58:05 you're gonna have a lot of physical
58:07 anomalies problems body function
58:09 problems one does not get fat by eating
58:11 healthy food right you just don't
58:15 if you healthy food it's hard to put on
58:17 weight it really is it's all the
58:21 cholesterol which creates a massive high
58:23 blood pressure and heart failure if that
58:26 is something that we're trying to Revere
58:28 oh I guarantee you there's a rockefeller
58:31 medical institution that's going to take
58:33 all your money at the end of your life
58:35 which will be a very short one if you
58:37 slip you don't have to feel guilty
58:38 people just slowly turn the boat around
58:41 that's all get your superiority wherever
58:46 you can get it it's in a bunch of
58:48 different categories you know it we can
58:50 become much more superior about how we
58:51 communicate with other people we can
58:54 become much more superior about how we
58:55 communicate with ourselves most of us
58:59 have to make money so you need a trade
59:01 skill well hey go get superior with that
59:03 trade skill go grab another book go grab
59:05 your old books that you read in school
59:06 but maybe you didn't digest all the
59:08 chapters really well get back into it
59:10 again get fueled up
59:12 become your best and don't let anyone
59:15 take your race the pigment of your skin
59:16 and the geometry of your body and shove
59:19 that into the equation and say this is
59:22 why you're stupid this is why you're
59:24 you're not powerful in your life what's
59:30 what's really fascinating with the sort
59:32 of white superiority that I hear you're
59:34 the criticism of this theory right part
59:36 of it's a criticism of someone's
59:37 arrogance that they are superior and
59:39 that I agree with the other half is that
59:41 someone says well you don't deserve this
59:45 because your race is better than mine is
59:48 kind of what they're saying right when I
59:50 hear someone say white privilege which I
59:52 don't actually ever hear it in real life
59:54 it's only on the fake news right
59:56 what they're kind of saying is I'm
59:58 inferior and I'm inferior at a genetic
60:02 level and if you believe in evolution
60:06 for instance then you're if you say
60:09 white privilege and you believe in
60:10 evolution then then you believe that
60:12 there are it's gonna take millions of
60:14 years for you to become even a remotely
60:16 as good as these white people that you
60:18 dislike right if you believe that God
60:23 made you
60:24 then what's the deal why did God make
60:26 you so inferior that you have to
60:29 demonize another creation of God isn't
60:34 that weird but at all you know it's it's
60:38 like when people like Tony Robbins teach
60:40 us and he didn't he did not in Vince the
60:42 invent this but he said if you're trying
60:44 to program yourself to lose weight you
60:46 don't want to say affirmations like I'm
60:48 gonna be thin I can't wait till I'm Finn
60:50 you say affirmations like I'm glad I'm
60:52 not fat I'm glad I lost all that weight
60:54 I really like the way you know I
60:58 maintain my weight I like the fact that
60:59 he healthy even though you're not you
61:01 have to say it in a positive otherwise
61:03 your subconscious which is a tiny child
61:06 doesn't know how to interpret that in a
61:09 positive way it will always say oh what
61:10 you're saying is I'm fat that's like a
61:13 woman says do I look fat in this
61:14 clothing right so when someone tries to
61:17 lean on this haves and have-nots
61:18 algorithm what they're always telling
61:20 themselves is they're the have-nots if
61:23 they try to make it a genetic issue holy
61:25 [ __ ] they are forcing themselves into a
61:29 permanent designation of being
61:31 genetically inferior I talked to a guy
61:36 recently talked about Eastern religions
61:39 and he said he said that when someone's
61:42 an atheist what's interesting is in
61:44 order to be an atheist one has to
61:46 acknowledge the existence of God to then
61:47 deny God I think it's a bit of
61:51 philosophical hodgepodge [ __ ] but I
61:53 think he has at least a subconscious
61:56 frequency to the mind that is saying
61:59 that there is a god I have to deny it
62:01 because that if you hear any affirmation
62:06 that God exists to deny it then your
62:08 subconscious is going to believe that
62:09 God exists and
62:10 you're in this constant tumultuous
62:12 paradox of your brain saying I believe
62:15 but I don't believe I have to believe
62:17 that I don't believe it right something
62:18 doesn't exist why even talk about it
62:20 right as a society we have to utterly
62:25 stop this lunacy we do
62:28 I'm hoping this episode will give you
62:31 some tools to develop language of your
62:32 own that is more compatible with the
62:35 people that you might know that might
62:36 spew this kind of [ __ ]
62:38 are we all equal I don't know you know I
62:44 feel like being equal is sort of like
62:46 saying are are the numbers 10 and 10
62:50 equal yeah sure but maybe someone is
62:55 adding you know five twos together to
62:58 get to ten and someone might be adding a
63:00 five a three and a two together but they
63:02 all reach 10 at best that is how we are
63:05 equal we have our own strengths that get
63:08 us to the sum total of whatever it is to
63:11 be a conscious living human in this
63:14 vessel right if we truly have souls then
63:17 the only level of measurement or metric
63:20 that we can have in human bodies is
63:22 whatever the human body has experienced
63:24 and its geographical location but when
63:28 you die and your vessel goes away
63:29 where's your IQ if you want to track
63:32 such a theoretical thing turn into I
63:35 would say the same number as everyone
63:38 else's if there truly is a river of
63:41 consciousness that is in the universe
63:43 well then if you jump in the river and I
63:46 jump in the river and we're both wet
63:47 with knowledge well then the only
63:50 difference might be that you're swimming
63:51 in the pool over there that is more of a
63:54 cosmology version of physics of how God
63:58 made the universe over there and I'm
63:59 swimming in love over here and I
64:01 figuring out love over here but you have
64:04 the same quantity of knowledge per
64:06 capita as I have where I am right the
64:09 world right now is in a very interesting
64:10 phase there's probably the 99.9 percent
64:15 of the world is living in reality and
64:17 there's that point 1 percent that's
64:18 living in televised news of the world
64:21 the televised fake consciousness
64:23 humanity unfortunately it's obviously
64:27 dominated by the disinformation people
64:30 out there they're constantly telling you
64:33 how your world works how it has come
64:37 together how it exists scientists that
64:41 aren't scientists telling you about how
64:43 things work people who take paychecks to
64:46 tell you that there you know there is no
64:48 human biology at all there's no gender
64:51 biology
64:52 there's psychological gender and then
64:55 there's physical gender it's two
64:56 different things two different worlds
64:58 one doesn't have to negate the other but
65:01 perhaps we shouldn't use the same terms
65:04 there's distinctions about what we're
65:06 trying to make a distinction about
65:08 there's the famous interview with that
65:11 the guy from CNN he's a black guy he's
65:14 gay just say that so you know who he is
65:17 he was interviewing Morgan Freeman
65:18 another black guy who's straight and
65:21 it's a famous interview where the guy
65:23 the obviously fairly privileged black
65:27 guy who's become a news anchor has done
65:31 a bunch of things right in his life to
65:33 get that job and he was arguing with
65:37 Morgan Freeman saying how dare you tell
65:39 black people that they can get out of
65:40 the ghetto in so many words why would
65:44 you set up false hope in a black person
65:46 in the ghetto that they could ever get
65:48 out of the ghetto and Morgan looked at
65:51 him and said [ __ ] you said it right
65:53 on air [ __ ] how dare you tell anyone
65:57 they can't become whatever they set
65:58 their mind to and that is the crux of
66:02 this whole episode [ __ ] that there's
66:06 any limits to superiority you know I
66:10 watched a migrant worker pound a ring
66:13 out of a quarter you guys have seen this
66:17 some of you have seen this they take a
66:18 quarter and they punch a hole in the
66:19 Senate a drill a little hole in the
66:21 center and they take a spoon or some
66:24 other harder object and they beat the
66:26 [ __ ] out of this quarter until they turn
66:28 into one of the most beautiful rings
66:30 you've ever seen it has to be a 65 or
66:32 before the pure silver quarters but they
66:36 pound this thing in
66:37 to an absolutely gorgeous ring and they
66:39 can get the ring gauge right on your
66:41 finger they know how big your finger is
66:42 they just have a little ring gauge thing
66:44 and they they measure they put that on
66:45 put it on their own finger that matches
66:46 your ring gauge or whatever I will never
66:49 in my lifetime pound a quarter into a
66:51 ring but man it fascinates the hell out
66:54 of me that that skill exists right is it
66:57 a big revered career in the world is it
66:59 astrophysics is it going to the moon no
67:03 but is it just as brilliant as someone
67:05 who creates a freakin silicon chip I
67:09 would argue yes it's amazing I think you
67:14 feel me we have to undo this stuff we
67:18 have to undo the damage that these
67:19 stupid theories make or have on our on
67:22 our society and especially on our inner
67:24 minds and then we have to repair the
67:29 damage that's been done and then we have
67:32 to educate ourselves and a way to
67:35 communicate such that this stuff never
67:36 takes root again so when it comes up
67:38 again when some shyster or some person
67:41 who's feeling sorry for themselves comes
67:43 up with these scapegoat theories and
67:45 tries to gain advantage through some
67:48 ill-gotten gain it'll never work out
67:49 right you can you can be any race of the
67:52 van white and you can sit around all day
67:55 and you could tattoo it on your forehead
67:57 so that when you look in the mirror it
67:59 still reads correctly white privilege is
68:01 the reason why I don't have what I have
68:03 white privilege white privilege my
68:04 privilege guess what's never going to
68:06 happen as a result of doing that every
68:08 day that person will never get any
68:10 smarter never incur any more success
68:14 than they would have succeeded if had
68:16 they just picked up a book with their
68:17 time instead of running around with this
68:20 stupid mantra of them being a have-not
68:23 and feeling sorry for themselves if you
68:26 want to take your body from being out of
68:29 shape to in shape well pissing and
68:33 moaning about people that are in shape
68:34 all day long is never gonna make your
68:36 body look any better right and we know
68:38 that that's just like a given that's
68:40 common sense
68:42 so pissing and moaning about someone
68:45 else's privilege well whatever it's in
68:47 your brain that that's the case it's in
68:49 your brain that that is the reason
68:51 why you don't have what you have but so
68:54 let's just say you wipe out all the
68:56 white people they get on up they get on
68:57 a spacecraft cuz they're so intelligent
68:59 they make spacecrafts and they go out
69:00 into space they find a better planet
69:03 some other guy out there in space and so
69:07 you're now left with your I guess any
69:11 void you're left in a total void any
69:13 lack of privilege because those people
69:15 that have been usurping all the
69:16 privilege are gone but they left all
69:20 their books behind or maybe we took our
69:21 books with us right all of us white
69:23 people who wrote all the only good books
69:24 in the world right I don't know of any I
69:28 don't know too many white gurus out
69:30 there how about you but now you're stuck
69:35 with your own line of [ __ ] I'm
69:37 saying you and a proverbial external you
69:40 not you are now they have to read a book
69:44 now they have to get educated now they
69:46 have to relearn everything that was
69:48 discovered by all these other people
69:50 that they thought were the reason why
69:52 they didn't have what they had now let's
69:57 just say you have a stopwatch in your
69:58 hand and you're gonna run the simulator
70:01 that God's gonna give you access to to
70:02 watch how long it takes for those races
70:04 that have been escaped coding other
70:06 races to get up to where they need to be
70:08 I'm gonna say there's a high likelihood
70:11 that they'll just simply fall back to
70:13 what they were and make that the
70:14 standard there really isn't a desire to
70:17 be anything other than what they are
70:19 because if there was you wouldn't worry
70:21 about anyone else having it you go get
70:23 it yourself
70:24 right you need my buddies who are famous
70:26 for whatever they've done they did not
70:29 sit around in their houses and say oh my
70:31 god there's other white people with
70:32 talent that I want and therefore I'm
70:35 gonna work really hard nope they fell in
70:37 love with art they fell in love with
70:39 drums and guitars and singing and
70:41 composing they love science they loved
70:44 anything else and they busted their ass
70:46 because of their internal passions their
70:48 homes are covered in what they do they
70:51 got careers in it they weren't very good
70:53 at the beginning and then they got
70:54 really good because they continued their
70:56 passion and race never entered their
70:58 mind at all if you haven't been to deep
