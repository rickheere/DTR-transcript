00:23 you
00:24 [Music]
00:34 good afternoon ladies and gentlemen
00:36 welcome back to deep thoughts today I'm
00:39 going to talk about something that I
00:43 think might get at the heart of some of
00:45 the problems that we're having in
00:47 perceiving each other in this world now
00:53 anytime I get into the one of these
00:54 subjects it's 99.9% of the people carry
00:58 the nine quite a bit can get into this
00:59 conversation until they understand it
01:01 and then there's that fraction of a
01:04 single percent that is the folks that
01:07 are trying to corrupt the world that
01:10 will hate this and try to convince a
01:13 fair micro percentage of human beings
01:16 that this is all [ __ ] and we should
01:20 stay on this self-destructive path of
01:23 depopulation anger division etc this is
01:29 about unity and this is about the way it
01:32 was less than 50 60 years ago in the
01:35 United States of America quite frankly I
01:37 don't know what the coasts were doing in
01:39 the 70s and 80s I was in the Midwest of
01:42 the United States and so that's where I
01:44 was when I started watching this unravel
01:46 I think it was fairly global to be
01:50 honest this episode is about the return
01:54 of the hero now
01:59 I'm using kind of a storyboard version
02:02 of that description right a hero heroes
02:08 aren't all male they're not all female
02:10 they're whomever wants to engage in
02:14 saving society saving a village saving a
02:18 family saving a friendship saving
02:20 themselves at all levels of micro and
02:23 macro heroes used to roam this world
02:26 freely and then there was a change there
02:31 was a change and it almost seems now as
02:34 if heroes aren't allowed to exist
02:37 anymore not in male form not in female
02:39 form and the only ones that are
02:41 marginally allowed to you know have the
02:46 adjectives applied to
02:48 that would equal a hero at some point if
02:50 someone is under the thumb of some
02:54 alphabet agency of some Hollywood
02:56 apparatus under some paparazzi apparatus
03:03 those are the only folks that are
03:05 allowed to voice any opinion whatsoever
03:07 but then they don't have their own words
03:10 anymore or they're a pre censored as Rod
03:12 Serling said in 1959 they simply carried
03:15 the agenda due to complete ignorance
03:17 maybe some stupidity do I make this
03:21 episode because I want you to remember
03:25 that they used to exist I want you to
03:28 have the definition of these heroes in
03:30 your mind on a daily basis now I'm going
03:33 to come at this from a predominantly
03:37 male perspective for male heroes because
03:39 that's where I connect with heroes in
03:41 this universe however I'll do my best to
03:47 discuss some of the female heroes as
03:50 well but now let's before we just run
03:55 into some trivial definition of a hero
03:59 why do we even need heroes in this world
04:02 why do they need to exist because they
04:07 have the courage and the enlightenment
04:10 to not only see what's wrong but to go
04:14 after what's wrong and fix it how many
04:19 times can you remember back to your
04:22 childhood when you needed to do
04:24 something but you didn't know how to do
04:25 it you needed to know how to swim you
04:28 wanted to jump in the pool all the other
04:29 kids were in the pool but you didn't
04:31 know to swim yet and so you're sort of
04:33 terrified you're either the kid who just
04:34 jumped in and said hell I'll figure this
04:36 thing out or you sat on the edge waiting
04:39 for a parent to help you out or just
04:41 something to happen something to click
04:43 you were at the school dance and you
04:47 never danced in public before and so you
04:49 went out there and you're like oh my god
04:50 I can't really do this in front of
04:51 people they don't look like they can
04:53 dance how much worse could it be but
04:55 still you hesitate all of us have dozens
05:00 and dozens of these things
05:01 before we turn 20 years old at least
05:03 right remember my father taught me how
05:07 to shoot shoot a pistol for the very
05:08 first time he took me underneath a
05:10 bridge of our hometown you got a 45
05:14 automatic and I think it was 45 he was a
05:18 9-millimeter I don't know I think it's
05:20 45 though and he shoots a hell on a
05:21 bunch of cans and he goes here you do it
05:23 and just hearing the the the noise the
05:30 shockwave off this weapon was very
05:32 intimidating at first we weren't wearing
05:34 earplugs either which was pretty damn
05:36 stupid and then you know you fire it
05:41 once or twice you're like oh my god I
05:42 can do this while this is really fun I'm
05:44 pretty good at this Hey
05:48 so heroes have a parental element to
05:52 them they have a chief Donella to
05:54 element to them the chieftain one is the
05:56 one that really takes care of society
06:00 there's the old John Wayne movie I know
06:02 what movie it is but he grabs a boy who
06:07 hasn't learned how to swim yet he
06:09 doesn't know and either has some real
06:11 you know shallow pond and he takes the
06:14 kid and says okay well if you haven't
06:15 learned how to swim yet which in his
06:19 sort of insinuation was the hell took
06:22 you so long I mean you're a grown child
06:24 let's you should know how to swim all
06:25 right he just takes a kid and throws him
06:27 in the pond and then his mother runs out
06:30 of the ranch house and says what are you
06:32 doing he doesn't know how to swim yet
06:34 and he goes we'll go get him you know
06:37 and she sit and she's like oh she looks
06:40 he goes oh wait a minute you don't know
06:41 how to swim either so he grabbed her and
06:43 throws her in the pond the thing is he's
06:46 not trying to kill them people he knows
06:49 how to swim if there's any problem with
06:51 either one of them getting out of the
06:53 water he's gonna jump in and get him but
06:55 both of them in this fictional film swim
06:58 out and they were okay and now they're
07:00 not any fear of the water what's really
07:04 fascinating about history is that with
07:08 one generation removed the amount of
07:10 history you can erase and revise once
07:14 they're dead
07:15 is mind-blowing it's so all conclusive
07:21 all-encompassing it's sort of scary it's
07:28 scary that if the baby boomers die off
07:31 all of them won't even over the cutoff
07:34 year is they can erase and revise they
07:41 being the bad people all of the history
07:43 that occurred during their watch all of
07:45 it and as older genex guys and growls
07:50 might go but wait but that's not what
07:51 happened did it out and they're just
07:53 looking at you like you're next you know
07:55 as soon as you die then their stuff gets
07:58 completely solidified and your history
08:01 starts getting revised and it's all
08:03 revised to enable and empower the scum
08:07 of the world right I hope that five
08:11 years from now me saying that and
08:12 talking about the ruling class a lot of
08:14 stuff seems like the dumbest thing on
08:15 earth because they don't exist anymore
08:17 maybe I'll even pull those shows or
08:19 watch the channel clean and come up with
08:21 something new I'm gonna get a vague an
08:24 example and I don't want all of you out
08:26 there who on the opposite side of what
08:29 I'm saying to piss yourself
08:31 with anger but in my experience of life
08:39 the president United States Donald Trump
08:41 has he exudes behaviors that have always
08:46 been within the heroes that I know who
08:49 are legit who are 100% real now again I
08:55 don't know that man so I don't know if
08:56 he's able to play one on TV and when he
09:01 gets behind closed doors he's completely
09:03 different and I don't agree with
09:04 anything he says
09:05 I don't know again as I've said several
09:07 times on shows I would do things
09:11 differently if I were him but maybe he
09:14 has a rhyme to his reason he certainly
09:18 has not failed much in life right I mean
09:22 that's the other thing to do is like we
09:23 have to say jeez you take advice from
09:24 people who are where you would like to
09:26 be in life
09:27 and he always tells us he goes look I
09:30 don't do anything willy-nilly I plan
09:33 everything that I do I say very specific
09:35 things I behave a certain way because
09:38 it's entertaining and it's informative
09:40 and it gets the job done when it comes
09:41 time to making a deal okay
09:45 he is the president he had what 1% odds
09:48 of winning my god if you had voted on
09:51 Donald Trump in Vegas using any of the
09:54 mass media odds that he would win you
10:00 would be an ultra ultra millionaire
10:02 right now two-degree could put money in
10:04 that phenomenal but now there's a
10:09 coarseness to this man that people
10:11 really dislike and again there's not
10:14 everything he says is cringe free in my
10:17 world either but heroes tend to have
10:22 this maverick ownership of who they are
10:25 as human beings right they do it their
10:29 way Frank Sinatra and I did it my way I
10:34 mean you think that's just a song but if
10:36 you think about it he's blue eyes I mean
10:38 he was Frank Sinatra mafioso
10:42 extraordinaire at the end of his life he
10:48 did it his way
10:49 so did Elvis Presley so did Prince think
10:53 about all these people in our world that
10:55 have owned their destiny they've done it
10:58 their way and they may end up being a
10:59 little crazy to us at the end Howard
11:02 Hughes Elon Musk a little bit right but
11:09 they get things done don't they know the
11:14 other measurement it is again did they
11:16 step on anyone's head to get ahead
11:18 hopefully not that's a true hero don't
11:23 it's your country versus another country
11:26 you never know where the truth lies
11:29 right America has extremely imbalanced
11:34 tariffs right now that are trying to be
11:35 cleaned up and of course super wealthy
11:39 countries are pretending to be rich
11:41 so that we're okay continually
11:43 subsidizing their industry with our tax
11:45 dollars insane but the amount of times
11:54 I've had the following conversation this
11:56 is where I start getting to the point
11:57 apologize for the big intro there it's
12:02 that when I was a kid heroes men the men
12:05 heroes the man heroes that I actually
12:07 grew up watching which you know goes all
12:10 the way back to the 30s all the way up
12:13 were men they weren't necessarily super
12:18 tall okay they weren't all Arnold
12:21 Schwarzenegger 'he's be surprised how
12:24 many of your heroes are 5/8 you know
12:26 your your Tom Cruise you know a lot of
12:29 people think he's about 5 7 doesn't
12:31 matter you don't have to have a certain
12:34 stature you don't have to be
12:36 good-looking
12:37 none of that stuff you have to behave
12:40 like a hero you have to start piercing
12:45 the droney mob rules sort of mentality
12:50 the docile nation of sheep start getting
12:54 divided but you can speak sheep you can
12:57 speak wolf and you can get everyone hip
13:00 to everything look at Martin Luther King
13:01 talk about a hero he's waiting in the
13:04 middle of both white and black Society
13:06 in the United States of America and
13:08 trying to say hey everybody why don't
13:10 you stop hating each other there's some
13:14 beautiful things in the Bible that true
13:16 or not at least are true for us in terms
13:18 of its spiritual consistency with
13:22 mankind
13:23 we shouldn't be heating each other
13:28 realize most of that guy's speeches were
13:31 all out of his head and they are like
13:35 Abraham Lincoln speeches I mean it's
13:37 unbelievable when I was a kid you know
13:41 you had your Clint Eastwood's your Burt
13:43 Reynolds your James Caan's several
13:51 others trust me all being these heroes
13:54 in the 80s what do we have Bruce Willis
13:58 Sylvester Stallone Arnold Schwarzenegger
14:02 started getting more and saying with
14:04 their bodies because they just started
14:06 building and building a building that
14:07 Bruce Willis just remains sort of a kind
14:10 of an average tough guy looking thing
14:11 which was a nice little contrast to the
14:14 super body building of the other two
14:15 dudes but there was a manliness about
14:20 what they did and yes of course we see
14:23 them through the eyes of Hollywood
14:24 cameras so some of it is complete
14:26 [ __ ] and these people aren't exactly
14:27 the way that they're portrayed
14:29 portraying a hero on camera but trust me
14:32 I get it but when I was a kid you know I
14:35 was raised in part by a couple well one
14:40 I'm very close to the family it was a
14:41 Vietnam vet still is and he was just a
14:47 no-nonsense guy because he'd seen
14:49 everything he'd seen he did three tours
14:50 of Vietnam helicopter pilot you know
14:53 even shot down several times and
14:56 survived all the crashes and I mean talk
14:59 about a guy who just knows where his
15:01 priorities are and knows looks at me at
15:03 like you know ten years old he'll you
15:06 know whatever age we stopped kind of
15:08 visiting which might have been about 16
15:10 17 and he knew what time it was
15:14 I studied Kimpo as a kid martial arts
15:20 and my teacher was this excellent
15:22 Vietnam vet and he didn't he didn't fare
15:24 as well I mean he had major major PTSD I
15:26 could tell I didn't know what that was
15:27 called back then but but he taught kids
15:31 Kimpo and he was utterly brutal but fair
15:35 the way he would teach us to get our
15:37 stances together how to fight and how to
15:39 prepare and he was just amazingly brutal
15:42 this guy but in a way that you could
15:45 admire him I also had non-physical
15:51 heroes that were like my uncles who were
15:55 just geniuses one was a doctor one was a
16:00 genius computer guy who could also
16:03 illustrate he also helped form the Kimpo
16:06 studio that I
16:09 but then sort of I think it's more
16:12 television first than Hollywood second
16:15 and I think this is starting to come
16:17 away it's starting to peel off now we're
16:20 starting to go back to heroes which is
16:22 why I think this episode is called the
16:24 return of the hero we now have a clear
16:27 example of a strong male who you're not
16:31 gonna like completely depending on who
16:34 you are meaning you're not gonna like
16:37 every single thing that he does you may
16:38 overwhelmingly love the guy but you also
16:40 might hate the guy but he's defending
16:44 the United States of America he's
16:46 cleaning out the swamp and I mean you
16:48 have to understand these these swamp
16:51 dwellers like rod Rosenstein they are so
16:53 utterly embedded into their positions
16:56 and backed by other super embedded
16:58 assets that to pull them out is is
17:01 almost like trying to remove your brain
17:03 or your nervous system
17:05 you know spinal cord and not lose your
17:08 life I mean it's really really tough not
17:11 to have the country be injured because
17:12 they're willing to pull the plug on
17:14 everything they're willing to hit all
17:15 the doomsday suicide systems before they
17:20 leave because it's all about them it's
17:22 not about the people and it never was
17:23 about the people they protect their
17:26 their funders they fear for their life
17:29 because that's what happens when you
17:30 leave the game they kill you right
17:33 what's funny about that is any of you
17:35 have ever been in a real gang in at
17:38 least in Los Angeles you completely get
17:41 what the average human being doesn't get
17:43 you don't get away all right rod Rosen
17:49 seems not gonna get a little velvet card
17:52 in the mail that says that you can leave
17:53 now it's totally cool and here's your
17:55 keys to your new you know mansion and
17:58 Beverly Hills
17:59 that's never gonna happen for that guy
18:01 just get back in there and fight fight
18:03 it's like the end of 48 hours
18:06 burned out 48 hours trading places
18:08 Mortimer and the other dude tell this
18:10 the stock out of going and sell the
18:13 stock markets closed already button
18:17 television in the 90s you had men get
18:20 really small
18:21 and yes there's a physical element to
18:24 what I'm saying but there's also just a
18:26 psychological presence of man that just
18:30 got small and it was all about being
18:34 soft it was all about being constantly
18:39 tiptoeing around other people such that
18:41 you couldn't really be anyone you
18:43 couldn't be neutrally a man you couldn't
18:46 be a hero man for sure because whatever
18:49 you did was too much pop culture gets
18:53 into history and starts telling you that
18:54 again like I've said many times on the
18:57 show that men were assaulting women
19:00 constantly in the workplace that women
19:03 just waited until five o'clock when the
19:05 husband came home and got drunk and beat
19:07 beat them in their wife beater tank top
19:09 because that happened to every person in
19:11 the world so they want to build this
19:14 natural revulsion revulsion in your body
19:19 that says we can't go back to the way it
19:22 was the way it was was horrible when
19:24 women were getting beaten constantly and
19:27 guys would just you know it's like two
19:29 minutes into pawn is weighing out in a
19:31 girl's face you know at work every
19:35 interview was a casting couch situation
19:37 just lies lies lies lies lies and I even
19:42 have a friend of mine who because she
19:47 was able to mention a couple crass men
19:52 in their life at the workplace suddenly
19:56 it was true for everybody right you know
20:00 I I won't identify organizations that I
20:02 work for because the organization's have
20:03 nothing to do with it but man I've
20:06 worked in companies we had you know call
20:08 centers with 20 women in there taking
20:12 calls for selling our product back in
20:14 the day and the mouse on these girls was
20:17 unbelievable they talked about they
20:19 wanted to talk about what happened at
20:21 the party or who slept with who more
20:23 than the dudes ever did the amount of
20:26 sexual jokes were insane but you know
20:28 what we all lived you know we [ __ ]
20:32 live through it man
20:34 nobody was pushing some girl against the
20:36 wall in the back room and you know
20:38 forcing sex on her that would not have
20:44 been appropriate that would not have
20:45 been accepted and then she would have
20:47 told someone in that guy what I got his
20:49 ass beat or get arrested or all the
20:51 above that's the difference between
20:54 fictional pasts and real pasts for the
20:59 last 20 years Hollywood in television
21:03 have pretty much taught the women of the
21:05 world to date safe and it's it's sort of
21:11 safe to a degree that you would date
21:15 someone that you could control
21:17 potentially I mean entirely which again
21:20 no human being should be in that
21:22 situation any point in their life ever
21:26 they date men that someone crawled in
21:29 the window at night they'd be cowering
21:32 behind the women to be saved it's really
21:36 interesting there was a video a guy
21:37 created where he dressed up like a
21:39 superhero it was a [ __ ] anime fighting
21:42 character from street fighter and he's
21:45 this weird kind of buff guy in a white
21:47 dude and a elevator and so the people
21:51 come in to use the elevator and he's
21:52 rigged it all with cameras and so he
21:55 then goes crazy and acts like he's gonna
21:57 punch him which is pretty [ __ ] stupid
22:00 but there was in a video where this guy
22:05 came in with his girlfriend and hey guy
22:10 does the thing and he jumps behind his
22:12 girlfriend but if you just looked down
22:16 you know look at him he's onto you no
22:20 pants hanging down his ass you know
22:23 probably has 50 you know gangster rap
22:25 tracks and his car and he's a badass
22:26 when he's driving down the street but
22:27 the second someone tried to kick his ass
22:29 you know in his own mind he jumps behind
22:31 his girlfriend unbelievable and the
22:35 other one is that you see guys and
22:37 elevators now I mean the other 60 70
22:39 percent of his videos in this elevator
22:41 gag is that as soon as he starts going
22:43 nuts the men started screaming like
22:46 women
22:47 I mean like women the fact none even
22:51 like women like little girls very
22:54 bizarre but when I had this conversation
22:58 and smoked lounges and I said look and
23:01 the men have been puss if I'd and you
23:05 will get women and men going that's for
23:07 sure
23:07 oh my god because the women is still
23:11 like men are starting to find that it's
23:12 really a rare situation to be able to go
23:15 out there and find someone who's not
23:17 only appears to be a man but is also
23:19 level-headed and has that sort of
23:22 chieftain gene you know there's a women
23:24 can find tons of overly testosterone or
23:28 hormone doubt bros there are everywhere
23:34 but they're not stable human beings they
23:37 haven't matured past [ __ ] fifteen
23:39 years old and when they were fifteen
23:40 they were seemingly abused or something
23:42 right so we're waiting for those green
23:46 apples to turn red and hopefully they
23:48 all make it now I can say from growing
23:52 up in the Midwest in the 70s and 80s
23:54 that men is still this kid still the
23:57 case in some cases I think probably more
23:59 than 50% of the cases the men out there
24:00 are they work really really hard and
24:05 they don't have the right brain a sort
24:10 of softer side to them they're very hard
24:15 there are very hard dudes I mean they
24:18 get up again it's like they just drone
24:20 through their lives because that's what
24:22 life requires and they're getting the
24:24 job done they're providing for their
24:25 families and there's nothing really
24:26 wrong with them but there's that
24:28 hardness to them the reason I mentioned
24:31 that is that it might have been a
24:35 healthy stage for us to practice for 20
24:37 years this soften up everybody in
24:42 society and then which is funny because
24:45 here we are going into the gangster rock
24:49 or gangster rap thing gangster rock hey
24:51 it's a new one for you so you have some
24:54 metalheads
24:54 that stay hard not a hell of a lot of
24:56 them and then you have the gangster rap
24:58 thing which became extremely popular
25:00 as I said two seasons ago the reason why
25:03 I believe that this stayed really
25:04 popular was that it had a manly vibe to
25:07 it you know you listen to ice cubes
25:10 first two or three albums I mean Jesus
25:12 even lifts weights to that stuff it's
25:13 awesome it really gets under your skin
25:17 energizes you remind you of your
25:20 internal rage that you have available if
25:24 someone were to mess with you your
25:25 internal strengths but the 2000s turned
25:29 into auto-tuning in just a ton of really
25:32 feminine stuff for dudes the clothing
25:35 that we have to choose from is just
25:37 [ __ ] gross man it's all a bunch of
25:40 feminine colors or it's a bunch of
25:42 flannel you know you're like I said as
25:46 soon as grunge hit the market it's
25:48 almost as if they took every single
25:50 fashion designer four men took him
25:52 outside and lined them up and gunned
25:55 them down like some crazy fashion
25:58 Holocaust because we haven't had decent
26:01 clothing for men since probably the late
26:04 80s early 90s and I mean like you know
26:06 like suits that they give off this vibe
26:08 that you're a man your regular executive
26:12 wear that makes it look like you're a
26:13 man walking in the room I see people
26:16 wearing number one so I don't know where
26:17 the hell they're buying it money could
26:21 be no object and I couldn't find it
26:22 myself you know now I think that
26:25 everyone knows that we're in the
26:27 girl-power phase of Hollywood were
26:28 probably entering the end of the first
26:30 decade of this huge push to knock men
26:34 out of all the heroic roles and put
26:36 women in all the heroic roles and the
26:38 other crazy [ __ ] thing they're doing
26:40 is naming all the women men there they
26:43 have male names was the the captain in
26:46 Star Trek STD is Michael the one of the
26:52 lead characters in 100 is Clarke they
26:56 all have these these male names trying
27:01 to screw with your brain and you know
27:03 gender is somehow this you know you
27:06 don't look down and see what you got
27:07 between your legs it's all up inside
27:09 your [ __ ] head
27:10 and anytime that you're you know you're
27:13 really physically one way and they're
27:15 trying to get your brain to go the other
27:17 way they're talking about
27:18 institutionalizing in your mind a mental
27:20 illness all right now it's different for
27:24 someone who's I think potentially born
27:26 that way and they always were that way
27:28 that's the way they're programmed but
27:31 someone who was oriented according to
27:33 their physical gender who is then later
27:36 convinced to switch that is a social
27:39 mental conditioning but now don't we
27:42 want our women to be strong and the
27:44 answer is yes my question is is why was
27:47 it that when I was young the women were
27:49 amazingly strong right my grandmothers
27:52 were not to be messed with and in other
27:54 words anyone else's grandmothers to be
27:55 messed with
27:56 you know could all grandmothers beat
27:58 your ass with their own bare hands no
28:00 but that's why they have dads and
28:02 grandpas and uncles and brothers they
28:06 would take care of if mom couldn't the
28:08 mom was the one that said beat his ass
28:10 you know what he did to me today boom
28:13 and you correct your habit correct your
28:15 behavior
28:16 there have been studies after studies
28:18 after studies about what creates
28:20 depopulation the death of the hero was
28:26 all about the death of two things
28:28 one your alpha male American that could
28:33 fight back against anyone messing with
28:35 this experiment of freedom that
28:37 Europeans created for those that remain
28:43 strong they're sent off to war to die or
28:46 be injected such that by the time that
28:48 they have any faculties or money they're
28:51 suffering from ALS joint pain radiation
28:55 damage and they're dead so you send the
28:57 most astute off to die a tiny sliver
29:01 goes into professional sports the other
29:05 ones are so financially destitute
29:06 because they've destroyed the economy
29:08 and those old meat potatoes jobs have
29:11 been sent to other countries so that
29:13 other basic masculine males can get
29:15 those jobs in other countries and then
29:18 the other ones are not strong enough in
29:21 the mind to
29:23 stop wearing capri pants being pussified
29:29 by a cultural influence they don't own
29:31 their own mind the females that behave
29:36 more masculine this is a very scientific
29:39 thing there well a couple things occurs
29:43 if a woman is going to have a choice
29:46 between being a mother of four or being
29:49 Oprah Winfrey and if culture says look
29:54 at the magazine's look at the magazine's
29:55 don't you need people to tell you that
29:58 you're pretty and don't you need this
30:00 Maserati don't you need that incredible
30:04 whatever pair of shoes well the only way
30:07 you're gonna get it is to be rich and
30:09 the only way to be rich is to get rid of
30:11 this family idea you have and be Oprah
30:14 Winfrey so they solicit women away with
30:21 culture from having children thus
30:23 reducing world population again America
30:25 has no population problem whatsoever
30:27 at all most first of all countries have
30:30 no population problems whatsoever the
30:32 population problems exist in like you
30:35 know four different locations China
30:38 South America Africa and India you have
30:42 the lowest IQs on this planet they
30:45 procreate like crazy but they're going
30:47 after the innovators of the world
30:49 because we're the ones that fight their
30:51 control apparatus Hey
30:54 once they control first world countries
30:55 what they will do to third-world
30:57 countries will be astonishing violent
31:00 and utterly draconian in fact it'll
31:04 probably put to shame anything that's
31:05 ever happened on the face of this planet
31:07 does the amount of deaths that they can
31:09 orchestrate because no one will be left
31:11 to fight back everyone will be docile be
31:15 no more power structure it'll be no more
31:16 alpha males that'll be a subspecies that
31:19 disappeared a long time ago extinct the
31:22 biggest I think trick that they are that
31:26 they the deep state are playing on
31:29 humanity is to make you believe that
31:33 your gender your orientation has to do
31:36 with your genetic programming if you
31:39 believe that then you no longer fear the
31:41 social implications of how you're raised
31:45 and maybe both happens right but again
31:48 my experience
31:50 virtually everyone I know very deeply
31:52 has an interesting childhood story that
31:55 happens to correlate with their
31:56 orientation and it was someone imposing
31:58 themselves on them as a child just so
32:03 happy to be that way but if you think
32:08 you can only be determined in your
32:10 mother's womb and then you walk out in
32:11 society like hey nothing can influence
32:13 me either way and then all these social
32:17 pressures come on you it's not cool to
32:19 dress like a man you have to dress like
32:22 a woman right Hollywood puts every actor
32:25 in a dress Dave Chappelle completely
32:28 figured it out
32:29 and he's completely right there's very
32:32 few actors in Hollywood that haven't
32:34 dressed like a woman
32:35 very few what if America turns out
32:39 really really well in a couple couple of
32:41 years 2020 the tariffs are balanced
32:44 education is up and unemployment is so
32:46 low we didn't even talk about it anymore
32:48 the amount of jobs that are out there
32:50 are so plentiful it's everyone's just
32:53 running around the country going I don't
32:55 know what I want to be because there's
32:56 so many things I can pick from the
32:58 vending machines packed and there's new
33:00 products going there every single day
33:03 perhaps there's a new invention some
33:07 innovation maybe there's some cure to
33:10 cancer the internet gets 50 times faster
33:13 cars get anti-gravity I don't know you
33:17 know something happens are we going to
33:21 allow that to be acknowledged in this
33:23 country in the world that sort of a
33:26 brute force male most definitely alpha
33:29 got into the white house with a bunch of
33:32 other brute force males and females and
33:36 we're able to
33:39 improve society by having the balls to
33:43 say okay okay we're gonna simplify here
33:46 right schools no more [ __ ] with kids
33:50 brains right no more degrees that are
33:52 unemployable right there's just a male
33:57 and female bathroom you choose which one
34:00 you think you're a part of pedophilia is
34:04 wiped out and I mean we double triple
34:08 quadruple the penalties we actually use
34:13 our surveillance system to find these
34:15 people instantaneously you don't any
34:19 spam in your email anymore because it's
34:20 really [ __ ] simple to catch spam and
34:22 get rid of it anybody who fishes your
34:24 account and has you deliver a paycheck
34:26 to a word courier we do a partnership
34:29 with one of those other countries and
34:31 those people get tied and quartered in
34:34 front of everybody
34:35 literally you want to steal the people's
34:39 money there's not a death that hurts
34:44 enough for you okay
34:47 the shows on TV and the movies that try
34:50 to get me that are all endogenous
34:51 everything is constantly [ __ ] with
34:54 nobody knows who's what or where they
34:57 just don't get made anymore because
34:59 society won't go and pay to see the
35:02 movie and they won't turn the channel to
35:04 give it the ratings so it all just dies
35:06 off naturally maybe we get some new sort
35:10 of sophisticated I Love Lucy or
35:13 something right the soldiers no longer
35:16 get pumped full of tremendously toxic
35:21 chemicals to make them you know fight
35:23 off chemical weapons we don't start wars
35:25 for the deep state anymore like at all
35:28 so they get to stay home and they get to
35:31 have jobs whatever they want maybe they
35:34 start off in sort of some vocational job
35:37 that's more meat potatoes putting
35:39 together cars on the assembly line but
35:40 they have such incredible opportunities
35:43 this is for the females as well but men
35:45 are the ones that predominantly go to
35:46 war right that we get them educated in
35:49 robotics or
35:51 monix or art maybe some guy pounding out
35:55 cars everyday writes the back next best
35:57 starwars who knows
35:59 same for the females right the joy of
36:03 having a family is reborn again females
36:10 there's not a hell of a lot of you that
36:12 watch this show that maybe 15 20 % you
36:16 know as well as I do if you're over 40
36:18 that this rat race of working for a
36:21 corporation was the biggest lie you've
36:23 ever heard in your life men already know
36:25 it okay so 80 to 85 percent of my
36:27 listeners automatically know that this
36:30 idea of you know slaving for some deep
36:33 state-owned major corporation is just
36:37 [ __ ] there's no rewards in there for
36:41 you whatever rewards they're dangling in
36:44 front of you they'll take them away
36:45 before you have a chance to get them on
36:46 most occasions and the the only time it
36:48 ever is the exception to the rule is
36:50 that like you know fraction of a single
36:52 percent that actually gets to be an Elon
36:55 Musk or some mark Rubin kind of guy
36:58 you're actually there and you actually
37:00 got a tremendous shot in the arm that
37:02 they want those folks to be there
37:04 because it's exactly like a Michael
37:06 Jordan
37:07 how many ghetto kids think they're gonna
37:09 be Michael Jordan you know I don't know
37:11 if it's LeBron James at this point but
37:16 those are they're out there like the
37:17 pimp the pimp that drives through the
37:19 ghetto and the convertible Bentley
37:21 smoking that $500 opa sachs cigars
37:25 they're there to bait the the young kids
37:28 into the system being anything other
37:32 than a man being anything other than a
37:35 hero the pimp sure ain't the hero you
37:39 know they get falsely misunderstood as
37:41 as if they were right some of them pop
37:44 out of that art and become heroes but
37:49 for those who stay in at their whole
37:50 life obviously not doesn't mean they
37:53 don't work hard why do we all as
37:57 individuals have things that stack up
37:59 that we know we need to do but we don't
38:01 do them it's because they're hard
38:05 they make us exhausted neither make us
38:07 exhausted mentally or physically or both
38:09 and they're not fun sometimes that's why
38:13 the things technically in your house man
38:15 who really [ __ ] loves that job if you
38:19 do send me your number I know some
38:23 people do but the idea is heroes get
38:27 that [ __ ] done
38:28 they just muscle through it come on
38:30 let's get this thing done and then when
38:33 you get done at the end of the day you
38:34 feel like a hero when you've actually
38:36 done what you're supposed to do it's
38:38 your list of stuff it's not someone
38:40 else's list of stuff but as a society we
38:42 have things that we all have to do for
38:44 society got to get some skin in the game
38:46 right what are the more interesting
38:50 things about YouTube is that men and
38:53 amazing women again I can't really talk
38:56 too much about the limit I mean I don't
38:57 subscribe to attend a women's channels
38:59 or anything but they're out there but
39:05 the amount of guys that have come out
39:06 and said you know this is all [ __ ]
39:09 I'm gonna fight for what's true what I
39:11 believe is true we're finally seeing
39:14 every emergency heroes and the male
39:17 gender and I don't turn on the channel
39:19 and find them dressed in dresses or pink
39:22 this and you know capri pants that I'm
39:26 not seeing it now the only reason why
39:30 some of them do were feminine colors is
39:33 that they go to the store and they're
39:34 like honey what do I buy and she goes
39:36 I'll buy this it'll look cute and she's
39:38 dressing her man up like a [ __ ] woman
39:39 and he just goes along with it cause I
39:42 just want to fight that battle that's
39:44 why that happens no and here's the thing
39:49 we know that just because you come out
39:52 and just because you want to be a man
39:53 doesn't exactly mean you completely get
39:55 mission accomplished right you could be
39:59 a man and you can be kind of a man-child
40:00 you can you know there's a very famous
40:04 personality who's suffering major slings
40:06 and arrows right now trying to keep his
40:08 show on on the air
40:12 you know talking about you know I'm
40:13 talking about he's definitely you know a
40:16 burly manly guy I think his voice is
40:18 fake I do think that he he has issues
40:24 his self perception isn't quite balanced
40:26 out so he pretends but he rants and
40:30 raves as if he has no empathy to
40:32 understand his audience whatsoever you
40:35 know I'm sure there's a small collection
40:37 of his audience that thinks that that's
40:39 great but I'm willing to bet they're in
40:40 the single-digit percentage but now he's
40:43 having problems and I think he's having
40:44 problems because of all of his rants all
40:47 of his embarrassing childish behavior on
40:51 his channel has come back to absolutely
40:53 haunt him he gave them everything they
40:56 needed to put him away for life for like
40:58 mental illness to be honest if they
41:03 wanted to if they literally wanted to
41:05 get the state that he lives into to
41:07 certifiably commit him to a mental
41:10 institution all they would have to do
41:13 was cut together is 25 30 years of
41:16 ranting and screaming like a child on
41:18 his show and show there's this there's
41:20 his dangerous habit where he loses his
41:22 entire character his entire
41:24 consciousness and they played all the
41:25 way up to like him doing it yesterday
41:27 and they go see we can't have that guy
41:29 on the street and they shouldn't show
41:32 him doing it on the street with
41:33 megaphones see he's a threat to society
41:36 he is a mental threat to society that's
41:41 what you don't [ __ ] around with who you
41:42 are you don't create these alter egos
41:44 and these characters you went to court
41:46 with his wife because she divorced him
41:48 and and you know it's very unfortunate
41:50 that occurred for him and Bo and for her
41:52 both and especially the kids but it
41:54 happened and he gets in front of a judge
41:57 with his attorney and his attorney says
41:58 oh that's just this gentleman's persona
42:01 his character that he is invented on on
42:04 the air that isn't real oh really
42:09 maybe you should rethink doing that it's
42:13 interesting because you know I obviously
42:15 have very little audience you know we
42:18 have a nice little group here but I've
42:21 always kept it real with you guys you
42:23 know if I felt like swearing I'd swear
42:25 some days I'll be you know more cranky
42:28 than others about a particular subject
42:29 or passionate other times I'm really
42:33 mellow that's me in real life I speak in
42:38 real life just like I speak on this show
42:41 what's interesting in as I've seen
42:43 individuals who have been very famous
42:45 for advising people both in kind of
42:48 conspiratorial news wake-up calls to
42:51 motivational speakers and they start
42:54 losing their audience and then they look
42:56 out into the competitors and they
42:59 realize that everyone else is keeping a
43:01 little more real and there's nothing
43:04 wrong with keeping things you know PG
43:06 for a bigger audience that I've seen in
43:10 the last year two of these guys who are
43:13 huge names huge name so the ones not a
43:16 conspiracy but ones motivational speaker
43:18 related and the other ones conspiracy
43:19 related and now they're starting to let
43:22 it hang out it's going to sound stupid
43:25 but they've started to swear when you
43:27 knew they wanted to swear in the past
43:29 and you know there's FCC laws you know
43:35 for swearing and so there has to be some
43:37 if you broadcast over an FCC regulated
43:40 ban wave you've got to be careful and
43:43 one case the motivational speaker and my
43:45 opinion should have never attempted to
43:47 be sort of I don't know darker with his
43:53 words I don't know you should have never
43:55 sweared ever and now he swears so much
43:57 so you're almost like wow you don't
43:59 sound like you use these words that
44:01 often so it sounds odd and disingenuous
44:05 like conspiracy guy it's like too little
44:09 too late and in a way it's strange and
44:12 this is what heroes do heroes stay
44:15 genuine to you I'm not trying to put
44:17 myself in this category but you know I I
44:19 copied my heroes and I say look you can
44:22 love me or hate me but really let's talk
44:24 about the results that you're getting
44:25 more than anything else in the entire
44:27 world the thing is is we hang out with
44:30 people that we are compatible with and
44:34 we also admire people from afar that we
44:36 feel like we have some kinship with
44:38 right
44:39 you seem to talk like I talk you seem to
44:42 think like I think you use the words
44:43 that I use you get angry about the same
44:46 things that I get angry about and you
44:47 get absolutely invigorated by the things
44:53 I get invigorated by it you love the
44:54 movies I like whatever doesn't mean
44:56 we're compatible necessarily but it
44:58 means that there's some overlap there
44:59 right it's a very interesting time
45:03 because the deep state is trying to
45:05 assassinate our president they are they
45:10 have attempted I guess 11 times so far
45:12 he was golfing in his course in Scotland
45:15 and a guy flew down on a parachute and I
45:20 we think killed one of the Secret
45:22 Service agents on the ground they said
45:25 he died of a heart attack yeah mm-hmm
45:28 because we have really unhealthy Secret
45:31 Service people so they covered up by
45:33 saying it's a natural cause but they
45:38 don't want us to be free and it doesn't
45:42 it shouldn't take one man to remind us
45:45 of that it shouldn't take one man to get
45:48 the job done and it's not taking one man
45:50 to get the job done it's taking hundreds
45:52 of people if not thousands of people to
45:53 fight for what's right so what can we do
45:57 on our end of the gig to make sure that
45:59 heroes rise again male and female we
46:04 have to raise the consciousness of man
46:07 through conversation to highlight
46:11 everything that matters right we do what
46:16 matters what does a hero do a hero plays
46:22 the long game they don't play the short
46:24 game I play the short game to just
46:26 defuse a situation but it's always up to
46:29 the long game I give an example and this
46:34 is gonna be a fictitious example but
46:35 you'll you'll feel me go back to the
46:40 Midwest of America during the 1800s
46:43 maybe about 1870s when Dodge City was
46:47 just Dodge City Kansas was insane
46:51 Tombstone Deadwood all these locations
46:53 right you had non heroes in there
47:00 shooting the place up immature boys with
47:05 guns taking out all of their
47:08 shortcomings on other people and it
47:13 created you know division between
47:14 families you know your Hatfields and
47:18 McCoys and so they had to shoot it out
47:23 at some points but at some point they
47:25 had to make peace didn't they there's
47:27 blood on both sides of the fence you're
47:29 never gonna avenge blood you just won't
47:32 because someone's gonna think they had
47:36 the right to shoot first and then
47:38 whatever you do after that is extra
47:40 blood that you didn't deserve in their
47:41 mind but at some point a chieftain had
47:45 to happen on both sides of the sexes
47:47 male and female they all had to agree
47:49 this has to stop and somebody swallowed
47:55 their pride
47:56 probably everyone swallow their pride
47:57 and they looked at the long game and
47:59 said look we need to you know build a
48:03 city build a town at least where this is
48:07 gonna we're gonna prosper because
48:10 otherwise we're gonna run out of kids
48:11 everyone's going to get killed and what
48:13 the hell is that going to do for us
48:14 right but it took a mature adult to come
48:20 up with that I think it's pretty heroic
48:23 you know I'll give you I'll give the
48:25 females a bit of a shout out here
48:27 without a full-blown shout out when a
48:31 couple decides to have a child think
48:34 about it you got a male and female in
48:35 the room and they want a bond and so the
48:39 male is like I will definitely have sex
48:41 with you because that feels good and I
48:44 won't pull out cuz that feels good and
48:46 then when I'm done I'm gonna take a
48:49 shower eat some food go to sleep watch
48:51 TV
48:52 but you're going to start growing a
48:54 child inside of you and you're gonna
48:56 carry that child for nine months then
48:59 you're going to go through childbirth
49:01 then you're going to go through maybe
49:03 some
49:04 depression right after that because the
49:06 child is no longer there that beautiful
49:07 moment is gone do you have your next kid
49:09 then you're gonna have to raise this
49:11 child and of course it's cute and cuddly
49:14 and all that stuff but it also screams
49:16 and yells and poops and pees a lot for
49:19 four or five years every time it goes
49:21 the bathroom you have to clean it up why
49:25 do I go through that because one of the
49:27 most heroic things that any female does
49:29 is have a child and obviously the second
49:34 and third and fourth is easier because
49:35 you know the game but still every single
49:37 time is this amazing commitment to
49:42 sacrifice your own mobility depending on
49:47 how old you are it could change the way
49:50 your body looks forever maybe you get a
49:52 stretch mark maybe some other things
49:54 happen there are people in this world
49:59 especially females that are trying to
50:01 combat the self perception that their
50:05 bodies are ugly especially after they've
50:07 had children and what I what I am
50:11 frustrated about is that the men who
50:14 seem to be very sparse the heroic men
50:16 don't seem to be jumping in and saying
50:19 look ladies the second you give life is
50:22 a second that you know you're a major
50:26 major hero
50:28 and these stretch marks and all this
50:31 stuff that happens to your body makes
50:35 you a hero you gave life of all things
50:40 you gave life something men can kind of
50:43 do but it's only a split-second thing so
50:49 you're a woman 45 years old you never
50:51 had any kids and you have a hot lean
50:53 body you have no stretch marks your
50:54 boobs are still perky your ass has no
50:57 cellulite in it okay good for you you
51:03 know snow slide against you or anything
51:04 but the woman who's standing right next
51:06 to you who's had three kids they're all
51:09 healthy and they're all wise and they're
51:12 gentle Souls they really created a great
51:14 family but she has everything changed
51:18 still maybe it even a decent shape but
51:21 she's not as perfect as this other
51:23 person there shouldn't be any level of
51:28 shame quite the opposite
51:31 you gave life even if you just gave life
51:33 one time it's still amazing right
51:38 consequently young girls don't have
51:40 babies anymore talking like 18 and up
51:43 when do we I mean there's very few
51:45 places in the United States of America
51:47 where a girl has a child between the age
51:48 of 18 and 25 through absolute love
51:51 consent and marriage but your body
51:53 almost completely recovers when you do
51:56 it that young when you do it in your 30s
51:58 and 40s that's when you get your
52:00 permanent changes to your body that
52:04 switch from having kids young to having
52:07 kids old is a deep state agenda they
52:10 were hoping you would give up before you
52:12 ever did it so if you did you won you
52:16 won there's so many brilliant wonderful
52:20 people in the world and they're not
52:21 having kids and they look at other kids
52:24 in you know restaurants at 9:30 at night
52:28 with their newborns screaming and
52:30 yelling because they should be in bed
52:31 and they're like Ben C I don't have any
52:33 kids because I don't have to deal with
52:34 that [ __ ] and I always look at them and
52:36 I say well those aren't your kids are
52:38 they you wouldn't be at this restaurant
52:40 at 9:30 at night with a newborn
52:42 would you they're really bad parents
52:44 over there you're not your kid's gonna
52:46 behave like you their kids are behaving
52:48 like them so stop giving up on society
52:52 people stop giving up on your own gene
52:55 pool moving forward you might say hey my
52:58 family was a bunch of [ __ ] I don't
52:59 want to have any more [ __ ] well
53:02 you're not an [ __ ] right yeah no I'm
53:05 not did you marry one no how no toy I
53:07 work really hard to find a really good
53:08 person okay then why are you thinking
53:10 that your child is gonna somehow
53:11 genetically inherit as holism just
53:15 before the 60s had dropped acid and
53:19 drugs and rock and roll at this next
53:22 level stuff right
53:23 obviously it started in the 50s
53:28 the adults of the world were extremely
53:31 responsible and rigid they had patterns
53:35 that got up and they did these things
53:36 like a machine and that machine allowed
53:39 us to build the country that is America
53:43 and I'm sure it's true for your country
53:46 as well if you're not from America there
53:47 was an era when your citizens worked
53:50 really really hard heads hands
53:52 heads down got everything going I'm sure
53:54 that some countries are still doing this
53:55 of course but I think the big question
53:58 ask is is your country being controlled
54:00 by the deef state right if you're part
54:03 of the European Union the answer is yes
54:06 currently America is coming out of this
54:09 coma of oh my god we let all these deep
54:13 Staters influence and infiltrate our
54:15 country changing the agenda of what was
54:18 a man and a woman down to the gender
54:21 where scientists sit there and argue
54:25 that you know I'm I'm not a man even
54:28 though I am like we need to stop the
54:32 [ __ ] lunacy here we need to protect
54:34 who the hell we are and we need to
54:38 choose the right path for our country
54:41 for ourselves as individuals a good
54:44 country will promote the individual not
54:47 some heads-down Prussian education thing
54:51 where it's like every saying is for all
54:53 my country it's like yeah it'll be a
54:55 natural thing for you to protect your
54:59 country if you benefit from the
55:03 countries format and I'll give you an
55:04 example that's in the corporate world
55:05 the worst employee you can have is an
55:08 employee that thinks about themselves
55:10 constantly they go to work for a nice
55:13 company and all the agendas is me me me
55:15 me me this is again not a giant night
55:19 not a gigantic corporation but like your
55:21 buddy's company or your company if you
55:26 can get employees to think for the
55:28 company and say I am here to make the
55:30 company better then that is the only
55:32 thing that's going to make the stock
55:34 shares that you might have been afforded
55:36 have any value right if you keep going
55:38 for yourself then you
55:40 going to spite your fellow employees
55:41 because it's all about you if you're for
55:45 the company then you help the company
55:47 and every employee starts doing a better
55:49 job and benefiting from it as well are
55:52 you going to work harder than other
55:53 people maybe but you're gonna have a bad
55:56 day and someone's gonna work hard for
55:57 you in your place right set a whole JFK
56:02 thing I just use this line in a small
56:06 town one I'm gonna repeat it but you
56:07 know it's the whole line about don't ask
56:09 what your country can do for you ask
56:10 what you can do for your country
56:14 if you maintain a good foundation your
56:19 country will prosper completely the
56:25 country is made up of its citizens right
56:27 there's no rock star out there that is
56:30 able to play a single concert unless the
56:32 fans dedicate themselves to that style
56:35 of music and show up to the concert
56:39 create a fan page create 10,000 fan
56:42 pages kiss the rock band Kiss is always
56:45 really good about saying we're nothing
56:47 without you always to this day
56:51 gene Simmons looks like his opening line
56:53 and it's very genuine he knows that's
56:55 the truth I think if you were ever on
56:59 the fence about how you were going to
57:01 behave for your life you got to make a
57:04 change you're gonna upgrade yourself you
57:07 couldn't pick a better time than right
57:08 now to upgrade yourself and make sure
57:12 that you're one of these heroes it
57:14 doesn't matter if you're young doesn't
57:15 matter if you're old you're not too old
57:17 to be in here oh and you're not too
57:18 young to be here oh by any stretch
57:20 doesn't matter if you're a male or a
57:22 female it doesn't matter if you're a
57:24 male but you're small and you're like
57:26 man I don't I don't have all these
57:28 muscles about you know I can't get in a
57:30 fight and win Hey go look up Coral
57:32 Castle see what a hundred and ten pound
57:36 guy was able to do great doesn't matter
57:40 doesn't matter doesn't matter if you're
57:44 pretty it doesn't matter if you are
57:45 considered by your the the cultural
57:48 impression of a beauty is that you're
57:50 somehow unattractive doesn't matter
57:53 but whatever you define a hero to be
57:56 which is hopefully something different
57:58 than you are like give yourself a carrot
58:00 a goal to go towards you can be this
58:03 amazing thing that you see in your head
58:05 and most of it is accomplished by simply
58:07 changing your mind one morning you just
58:11 simply say I'm not doing this anymore
58:13 this other thing I used to do I'm an
58:16 experiment with being amazing according
58:18 to my definition and hey you could even
58:21 copy a fictional character out of some
58:23 movie at a television show some fable
58:26 you heard a religious figure whatever
58:30 inspires you to be better than you are
58:32 today but let me just share something
58:37 from the screenwriting room and then
58:38 I'll shut up a hero is defined by the
58:41 decisions they make under pressure okay
58:45 in a lot of cases those decisions are to
58:51 make no decision you're too angry need a
58:54 chill out
58:55 other times you're going to rely on your
58:58 patterns that have worked for you in the
59:00 past so you're gonna say you know what
59:02 I've been here before and even though I
59:03 want to do this other thing I know that
59:04 the right thing is this thing over here
59:06 so I'm just gonna go this route B and
59:09 then I'm gonna leave pausing before you
59:13 talk can help you out tremendously right
59:18 sometimes you need to make decisions to
59:20 preserve yourself your own well-being
59:23 your own profit and whatever realm that
59:28 is and the other one is to benefit
59:30 others and take the bullet yourself just
59:33 temporarily I realize this is sort of an
59:38 esoteric episode but I think it's
59:40 something that comes up a lot in
59:41 conversation around me and we just don't
59:45 talk about it you know some of it's
59:46 we're not supposed to talk about it
59:48 because we'll offend someone who is into
59:50 what we are describing yeah my thing is
59:54 like well you can always change your
59:57 mind
60:00 you know I experienced something and
60:02 I'll leave you this one thing cause I
60:04 think I've seen it happen several times
60:05 for other folks as well when I grew up
60:09 in the 80s there I don't know I think it
60:14 was under attack in the 80s as well the
60:16 rockers wearing makeup Prince was all
60:18 over the place with his gender yeah he
60:20 was the most androgynous guy on planet
60:22 Earth and the fashion that we had was
60:26 very interesting but it wasn't hard
60:29 right no one was trying to dress up like
60:30 a gangster which is where we've been for
60:32 a long time you're either this
60:34 lumberjack [ __ ] flannel guy because
60:36 we can't get the grunge [ __ ] out of our
60:38 of our fashion options or you're wearing
60:41 gangster clothes or you're wearing pink
60:43 shirts with capri pants right those are
60:45 the kind of your options in America at
60:47 this point the even though I was
60:51 personally a very confident kid in the
60:52 80s there was still when I look back on
60:56 the photographs of what I was wearing
60:58 even into the early 90s I was not really
61:03 aware of the full package in my opinion
61:05 it wasn't about the mid 90s where I
61:07 really said ah there it is and then
61:10 later when I kind of accidentally grew
61:13 my hair out
61:13 I really thought oh my god this really
61:16 feels like Who I am it was really
61:19 strange that's a very strange thing
61:22 so recently telling you that is that
61:24 each decade I discovered something about
61:27 myself and tremendously changed the way
61:29 that I appeared to the world in fact
61:32 probably between the decade of 2000 2002
61:38 maybe 2007 when I started growing my
61:41 hair out that was like I was completely
61:44 lost as to who I was and I also think I
61:47 was pretty lost between like nineteen
61:49 ninety and nineteen nineteen ninety five
61:51 very lost whatever I was wearing it was
61:54 like asks just to cover up my body I
61:55 don't feel confident in this stuff like
61:58 at the photograph so I want to burn them
62:00 you know so it happens it happens to the
62:04 best of us right so that's you I
62:08 actually believe a lot of this is an
62:10 agenda if not every single bit of this
62:12 is an agenda
62:13 for you women who are disgusted with
62:15 feminism you absolutely know it's an
62:18 agenda agendas can be destroyed very
62:21 quickly don't watch things that disagree
62:25 with you
62:25 don't behave like you don't want to
62:28 behave simply because everyone else is
62:30 doing it
62:31 ladies don't date safe
62:35 don't go data [ __ ] you know guy who's
62:38 got a criminal record for strangling
62:40 women of course but don't go into this
62:43 thing I mean again I'll just tell you
62:45 there's two moments when you realize
62:47 you've got the wrong guy when you're
62:50 when you look down to little piece stick
62:52 and you're pregnant and you're looking
62:54 at the other dude going oh my [ __ ]
62:55 god
62:56 what did I just do and the other one is
63:00 the super rare case where either
63:03 someone's crawling into your house at
63:05 night there's a sound at night or you're
63:06 in some public situation and shit's
63:08 getting hot between people fighting and
63:10 you look at your dude and you're like
63:12 I'm [ __ ] like either I'm gonna have to
63:16 solve this problem in public you just
63:19 leave at home I don't know you're gonna
63:21 have to grab the candlestick holder and
63:23 [ __ ] it back and wait to see if you can
63:25 get a head shot might not work because
63:30 your man's not gonna do anything the
63:33 man's job is to protect and go get some
63:35 income minimum if you have any kids he's
63:40 supposed to know how to raise a daughter
63:41 different than he raises a boy he
63:45 doesn't try to make your daughter a boy
63:47 see you got all the [ __ ] time man
63:50 unbelievable so buck up and lay down
63:56 some ground rules for yourself become
63:59 the heroes that we need because boy I
64:00 tell you that's gonna be an industry I
64:02 think it's an industry right now but in
64:05 two years if America looks better we
64:07 haven't experienced some cataclysmic
64:09 deep state event to destroy the planet
64:11 or kill our president or whatever if you
64:14 can manage to be here oh hell even if
64:16 that [ __ ] happens you're gonna need
64:17 we're gonna need more heroes than ever
64:19 it's you it's you and that's what's cool
64:25 you can figure it out and if you haven't
64:30 figured out deep thoughts radio.com
