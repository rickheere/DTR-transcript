00:21 [Music]
00:29 welcome back ladies and gentlemen the
00:31 deep thoughts today I'm gonna hit you
00:34 with one that I think for some of you
00:37 it's gonna ring in your head for a long
00:40 time maybe even a lifetime I'm not
00:45 exactly sure what to call this if I
00:47 change the name forgive me in my brain
00:51 right now I'm calling this the
00:52 intelligence threshold now if you're new
00:56 to this show our definition of
00:58 intelligence is never represented on the
01:02 show jeopardy
01:03 our version of intelligence has to do
01:06 with the very basic form of thinking
01:10 deducing connecting deriving and perhaps
01:14 leading all that with a resulting in
01:17 perhaps a hypothesis that has a very
01:20 deep connection to reality as it is
01:22 observed by your head by your five
01:26 senses we don't really I mean we
01:29 encourage people to think up ideas but
01:34 it stays in that wing of the college of
01:36 the deep thoughts university until it
01:39 manifests a physical model even if it's
01:42 just on paper but it's got to be
01:43 physically explainable before we will
01:47 start to write it in our encyclopedia
01:49 that comes out once every lifetime what
01:55 if well let's back up we know that we're
02:00 in a reality the most mysterious part
02:05 about our reality is that regardless of
02:08 where you are and what your religions
02:09 are whether they be in scientific
02:12 religion or organized religion or your
02:15 own spiritual version of reality we are
02:19 merely attempting to deduce through
02:24 observation and experience both
02:27 spiritual and tangible who made this
02:31 place and why are we benign is that
02:38 has no general overall meaning or are we
02:42 a very intentional creation by a creator
02:45 that spends all of his or her time
02:47 observing us and babysitting us and
02:50 policing us and spanking us for being
02:52 imperfect as they created us so there's
02:55 options out there this theory is very
02:58 very powerful and you might think this
03:00 is some kitschy little episode but this
03:01 is most likely one of the most powerful
03:05 episodes of season 5 if not the entire
03:06 series I'm gonna say the theory and then
03:12 you're gonna have some maybe epiphany
03:16 reactions to dispute the theory and then
03:19 we are going to level those and go
03:23 through examples and try to take it to
03:25 the first stage of the rocket it might
03:28 take several episodes to get it all the
03:30 way to our upper atmosphere and thus
03:34 leaving our planet of thought to go off
03:36 to a next you know adventure and the
03:39 cosmos of our deep thoughts radio
03:42 University there seems to be this battle
03:48 in our minds the more that you become
03:50 educated the more that you also become
03:53 enlightened which i think is spiritually
03:55 becoming aware of the the information
03:57 that comes into your five senses and
03:59 perhaps your six seventh eighth ninth
04:01 tenth and however many infinite senses
04:03 we actually have the capability of
04:05 taking in but I've never been taught
04:08 that those avenues exist that those
04:11 arteries exist and so we just let the
04:15 data bounce off our soul or
04:17 consciousness or mind and we never know
04:20 it and one of it has to do with our
04:24 journey seems to have a cosmic algorithm
04:29 to it it really does we are born we live
04:34 a different stage because of the way the
04:37 world is organized now we have physical
04:40 stages that seem to dictate Decade
04:44 allegiances are
04:46 first ten years on earth are the very
04:49 random when did you wake up when was the
04:52 first day you fully remembered when did
04:56 you become self-aware how far back can
04:58 you think or sorry remember your
05:01 existence how detailed will those
05:03 thoughts and once we reach our teenage
05:05 years we gain a bunch of hormones much
05:10 upper level education from where we were
05:11 regardless of how bad education is the
05:13 curve does increase and then when we
05:16 reach our late teens we end up being
05:20 thrown out into society when there's
05:24 various stages that are dictated by the
05:26 age of our body you have so many years
05:29 to gain a partner effortlessly so many
05:32 years you might remain perfectly fit
05:35 without trying then things slow down
05:39 life slows down responsibilities
05:41 increase and it continues until the
05:45 mortal coil begins to deteriorate
05:48 alright that's the foundation of our
05:51 existence when you advanced up your
05:55 thinking to where are you who's with you
05:58 it becomes your immediate circle your
06:01 media family obviously is a child's and
06:03 then you gain friendships and you gain
06:06 lovers and you gain business partners
06:08 and friends and associates and that's
06:11 the second layer of consciousness the
06:15 third layer of our consciousness
06:16 consciousness is where you become
06:17 globally aware that there are people all
06:19 over this place that we are and that
06:23 they have constructed in years prior to
06:25 your existence whether we all be one day
06:29 old or the correct age that we might
06:32 think we are based on a birth
06:33 certificate and someone telling us that
06:35 we were born there's a command structure
06:38 in place a government in place laws laws
06:42 you had nothing to do with that our
06:43 govern you then within that mezzanine
06:47 you start to notice the successful
06:49 people quote unquote and the
06:50 unsuccessful people what defines success
06:53 is always relative to the time that you
06:55 live
06:58 let's say that we are in an intentional
07:01 experiment and I'm going to divide this
07:03 into two sections because there's
07:05 millions of options but we're gonna find
07:07 two that I think one is esoteric enough
07:09 that it will contain everyone else it's
07:10 not on the first one the first one is a
07:13 god a single unified being an omnipotent
07:18 creature that created all of the
07:21 universe and us and maintains us
07:23 nanosecond to nanosecond that God
07:27 invented us for a particular reason and
07:29 is observing whatever experiment is our
07:33 existence if that doesn't sit well with
07:37 your consciousness then let's lean over
07:40 to a straight up without exaggeration
07:43 1999 Matrix movie existence perhaps not
07:47 with the robots on the outside we're
07:49 being made you know to be batteries and
07:51 what-have-you and heaters we are simply
07:55 in a computer simulation in some group
07:59 created us and they are conducting an
08:03 experiment either way those origin
08:07 stories will work for our theory I'm
08:11 going to propose and we're going to give
08:13 examples that there might be an
08:17 intelligence threshold that is enforced
08:21 in this reality it is not necessarily
08:25 draconian meaning your IQ reaches a
08:30 certain stage and you die that would be
08:34 a draconian enforcement of the
08:36 intelligence threshold of which I'm
08:38 going to discuss what I'm going to tell
08:41 you is that man in this particular
08:45 experiment in a sociological view of our
08:49 existence is supposed to grow together
08:53 and intelligence we are not to be
08:57 drastically apart from each other in our
08:59 IQ now of course there's a few
09:02 exceptions because we do have a few
09:04 areas of the world that seem to be
09:07 five ten fifteen thousand years behind
09:10 everyone else and I would cite the very
09:13 peaceful well balanced tribes of both
09:18 Africa and South America and perhaps
09:21 again a few of the the islands around
09:22 New Zealand and other like-minded areas
09:26 right but I think that that is an
09:30 exception that isn't going to cause a
09:33 problem because the game isn't to say
09:37 they're worried about folks that are
09:41 behind a tremendous amount and again
09:43 they're very happy they're very peaceful
09:45 there's no criticism for me to them in
09:47 fact I think they might be winning the
09:49 game but there is a visible ceiling
09:55 perhaps in this reality of which when
09:59 you reach sort of a proximity of it
10:03 maybe you haven't hit it maybe you
10:05 haven't surpassed it but I believe there
10:07 are plenty of people that have your
10:11 entire journey in this world becomes
10:14 governed becomes restricted and perhaps
10:19 your success as defined by progress
10:22 perhaps not by money necessarily or
10:25 whatever else you know fame or whatever
10:29 you know other kids might want usually
10:31 if you're intelligent fame may or may
10:33 not continue to exist in your mind once
10:36 you think about how frivolous that
10:37 concept is you really just want to
10:40 affect your world and perhaps the entire
10:43 spectrum of what we call our world what
10:47 do I mean by this threshold well I've
10:49 said several times on the show and it's
10:51 a very interesting concept that evil
10:54 seems to be at the very top of all
10:56 authority all around the world it's a
10:59 very bizarre constant that we're dealing
11:01 with at this point the most evil people
11:04 become politicians the most evil people
11:06 become bankers if there's someone over
11:09 you at a high level of control not your
11:12 principal maybe not your you know your
11:14 minister or anything like that your boss
11:17 we're talking about people way way way
11:19 up on the ladder
11:21 now believe me I know a lot of things
11:23 just flew in your head that's Ella it's
11:25 not that man but we're gonna get to it
11:28 because I've been putting a lot of
11:29 thought into this recently what what is
11:32 afforded us would we become extremely
11:35 intelligent typically the outcome is
11:40 twofold but they're lined up on each
11:45 other like train cars one car goes first
11:48 and the second car gets to go second
11:51 because the first car is pushed through
11:52 the membrane right I think the very
11:55 first thing that we gain as a result of
11:57 becoming intelligent as well as
12:00 enlightened which means spiritual
12:02 spiritually aware of your reality what
12:06 is unexplained in our current
12:09 educational system however explained in
12:12 many beautiful texts by folks that have
12:15 spent their entire life's and generation
12:17 after generation becoming enlightened
12:19 Linc gurus or Buddhists or something is
12:22 control we gain control of our life the
12:26 more intelligent that we become not
12:29 smart smart being the Jeopardy game I
12:32 know the capital city of some state I
12:35 know the length of the Nile it's not bad
12:40 information in fact it's critical
12:41 information that are little factoids
12:44 that will factor into the intelligent
12:45 exercise of actually deducing something
12:49 with the information what is the second
12:53 thing you gain by gaining control
12:56 freedom you gain freedom well let's say
13:05 you believe in God or these matrix
13:07 programmers regardless we have been put
13:12 at a place that has a limited amount of
13:15 real estate our planet as it exists as a
13:18 heliocentric globe but perhaps hmm you
13:22 could say it flat disk but in a matrix
13:24 it wouldn't really matter what shape it
13:26 was pick whatever version of our world
13:30 that we have access to we our feet
13:35 and our planes and it's limited one of
13:42 the most appealing things to me about a
13:45 flat earth model to throw in here
13:48 because I think it feeds
13:50 I think Flat Earth for me is matrix but
13:54 it could be God - a lot of people
13:55 believe it's a very you know heavenly
13:58 construct okay but one of the things I
14:01 think is utterly brilliant about the
14:02 theory or cutlass if you believe it or
14:04 not and remember what was it our
14:08 generals McCarthy or Patton or somebody
14:12 I can't remember I can't believe I can't
14:13 remember it but it's someone mumbled the
14:16 name and then told me the quote but it's
14:18 the famous quote where true intelligence
14:20 is being able to hold two opposing
14:22 concepts in your mind and not [ __ ]
14:23 yourself because that's the problem that
14:26 everyone's having right everyone hates
14:28 globe or if you're fluttered there's
14:30 never hates flatter throughs if you're
14:31 glow versus like man you're still in the
14:35 lobby of the deep thoughts radio college
14:37 at this point you know a lot in yet but
14:40 one of the greatest parts about that
14:41 theory is the idea that as we try to
14:44 approach this either theorize dome edge
14:48 or an edge that leads to more oceans on
14:52 the outside of a disc and there's other
14:55 continents out there like the map that's
14:56 grabbed off the dude who ended up in the
14:58 Japanese airport that's just a
15:01 fascinating story it's just a great
15:02 story even if it's fake but it was
15:05 documented supposedly in the newspaper
15:07 over there but is it that the oceans get
15:11 colder and colder and colder more brutal
15:15 the continent that's down there
15:18 Antarctica whether it be a disc rim or a
15:24 true continent it's got land and so it
15:27 goes way up in the air chills the air
15:29 down and it's just really tough to live
15:32 there you can die in an instant up there
15:34 or down there I should say relative to
15:37 North America it's like it has a built
15:40 in barrier and that's a metaphor for
15:43 what I'm talking about when they first
15:46 hatched or rehashed this
15:48 Flattr thing in 2014 it was a story
15:53 about well they ran a story about the
15:56 mice that are kept in fish tanks with
16:00 the little wood chips on the bottom and
16:03 they the story goes is that nice in
16:06 these containers about once every 30
16:08 days seems like a very long time they
16:11 end up doing a pilgrimage on the edge of
16:13 the fish tank digging on the edge all
16:18 the way around keep going in circles and
16:20 circles the circles until they convince
16:22 themselves there's no way out
16:25 part of that is fascinating to me is
16:28 that the mouse reaches the pointers I'm
16:31 tired of this place I'm a pattern
16:33 creature just like you humans and I'm
16:35 tired of this pattern of this little
16:37 tiny cage you got me in I want to roam
16:39 around even if I get eaten by a cat at
16:41 least I lived and so the Association was
16:45 made with man that as long as the disc
16:47 was big enough man would never reach a
16:50 point where man would feel like this
16:52 mouse in a cage and never try to get out
16:55 but we have not reached an age of global
16:59 travel via plane be a boat that we now
17:04 have 100 percent the ability to figure
17:06 out every square inch of this planet so
17:12 why would that whole theory happen no
17:15 see you're on a planet to you're a
17:16 heliocentric person you don't lose the
17:19 entire theory of this creation keeping
17:22 us on this ball in space space of which
17:25 may or may not exist
17:27 no one's proven it and you've never been
17:29 in space but you can trust these
17:31 organizations that lie to you every
17:33 single day like NASA and all of its
17:36 little partnerships as the co brand you
17:40 know fake achievements by man for all
17:43 these other countries that want to
17:44 impress their citizens it's a money game
17:48 it's a control game but we're stuck here
17:52 if the Van Allen belts truly exist as we
17:55 perceive them to exist and as tests have
17:57 proven then we really can't leave
18:00 because that's that
18:02 has to be conquered and we can conquered
18:05 if that's all that divides us between us
18:07 and other planets and us and other
18:08 galaxies we will find a way to get
18:11 around it the only thing that would stop
18:13 us is if the materials of which we need
18:17 to exist in space simply don't exist so
18:20 let's say you're made of ether and for
18:22 whatever reason there is no ether
18:23 between planets which is absurd but if
18:25 that were the case we would just cease
18:27 to exist we couldn't take our ether with
18:29 us but that's a different conversation
18:33 but now let's make let's let's go over
18:36 to the the matrix side of this because
18:39 speaking on behalf of God is it's a
18:41 little tiresome we are programmers we
18:47 know that right now there are massive
18:49 multiplayer online role-playing games in
18:51 Mo's that simulate quite literally
18:57 reality World of Warcraft I mean gosh
19:00 it's one two three four five six major
19:04 continents uh seven major continents a
19:05 bunch of little islands and stuff
19:08 everywhere well for those of you are
19:10 engineers your character is stored on a
19:12 hard drive when you're not playing it's
19:15 as if you were sleep upgrades are made
19:18 well you don't play the game and you
19:19 come back in and upgrades what your
19:21 character is capable of doing upgrades
19:24 when you wake up your character it pulls
19:27 it out a long-term storage from a
19:28 harddrive puts it into memory your
19:30 consciousness and you run around and as
19:32 you run around it's storing constantly
19:35 in memory and drifting it down to the
19:37 drive slowly where you are in the world
19:41 X Y Z okay so by no means is this a
19:47 stretch that we live in a matrix now
19:49 scientists saying that there's proof and
19:51 that may be something that can be
19:53 contested but we're gonna go with it on
19:56 this conversation because we're talking
19:58 about a creator creating this program
20:02 that is our reality for all we know we
20:05 are the programmers we're just taking
20:08 turns playing the game hey I played the
20:11 games Electronic Arts
20:12 I played Ultima Online for four years
20:14 before anyone else saw it because
20:15 took us four years to make it you don't
20:17 do blizzard people are playing the
20:19 expansion right now that hasn't released
20:20 of course there but now and we'll the
20:25 Warcraft when you play the game and you
20:26 fly around and you find like the edge of
20:28 the universe and tons games do this
20:30 right the Skyrim does that oblivion does
20:33 the fallout does it you get to the edge
20:35 and it just says you can't go there
20:36 anymore little message on the screen and
20:38 you accept it because you know you're
20:39 playing a video game the context of this
20:41 is limited okay you're cool you're
20:44 bummed you're bummed because they
20:46 usually create some training out there
20:47 that you can't get to like just let me
20:50 get through there I want to go up there
20:50 and look inside but the last thing you
20:54 would want to have happen is to imbue
20:58 your characters in the video game with
20:59 the capability of what it happens in the
21:01 1982 movie Tron which is so poetic at
21:06 this moment in the conversation for
21:08 those of you haven't seen the movie
21:11 shame on you
21:12 but to a human being goes into a
21:15 computer not intentionally but ins up
21:19 he's a he's a computer programmer he's a
21:21 video game coder and he's one of the
21:22 best guys in the world that plays video
21:23 games in 1982 stand-up coin-op games
21:26 arcade games so he goes in and they
21:31 there's a faction that wants him dead
21:33 but he has to die playing a game that
21:35 was the rule sort of an honorable kill
21:39 well he finds a way to drive an enemy
21:43 light cycle into the wall and pierce a
21:46 hole the game grid which had the border
21:50 around it just like flat earth and for
21:53 those of you who think more three
21:54 dimensionally space around a ball it
21:58 opened up a hole and Kevin Flynn played
22:01 by Jeff Bridges calls back to the other
22:03 two Tron and RAM and says I'm getting
22:06 out of here you're invited he drives
22:09 right out the hole the other two guys
22:12 kill the last enemy light cycle dude
22:14 they go down the hole and they have left
22:16 the game grid it's tantamount to the
22:19 characters in a book coming off the page
22:22 and walk it out in the real world it's
22:25 Moriarty leaving the holodeck
22:28 now had in this fictional world of Tron
22:34 anyone who programmed the grid figured
22:36 out that that could be done they would
22:38 reprogram the grid such that it can't be
22:40 done they would definitely reprogram the
22:42 programs to be a bit like the host in
22:45 West world when the concept is available
22:48 then to them to leave the grid their
22:53 minds wouldn't be able to conceive of it
22:55 doesn't look like anything to me and
22:58 they would do what they would stay on
23:02 the grid complicit ly because they
23:06 cannot conceive of doing anything else
23:07 but staying on the grid now I can give
23:12 you a test that you can run in minutes
23:15 you could pause this episode and call
23:17 someone right now and test this theory
23:19 call someone you know who's not awake
23:22 who's not enlightened of any kind and
23:23 don't worry about the big dark awakening
23:25 just worry about being awake in general
23:27 and ask them if if you could open up a
23:32 dimension to another reality where the
23:34 programmers were that made this matrix
23:36 would they go through the hole and
23:39 they'd go what what are you talking
23:41 about just be dead on just be dead
23:43 serious but you know if we could find
23:45 the programmers that make this reality
23:47 would you want to go through the hole
23:48 and go and talk to them now some people
23:51 be like hell yeah let's do it
23:53 you got the map you got the Time Bandit
23:55 map let's do this do you have Morpheus
23:58 out there can Jack be out rescue my body
24:01 if we were to make this exact reality
24:05 remember that's the test I was giving
24:07 you folks think about it
24:09 you want to figure out how to run a scam
24:12 right not false flag or whatever it will
24:14 then make yourself the engineer of it
24:16 and as you make yourself the engineer of
24:19 it you will discover in the necessities
24:23 and your checklists that have to be
24:24 accomplished such this can be convincing
24:28 to the rest of the world that thinks
24:29 it's real an alien invasion
24:31 a meteor strike I think that maybe and
24:38 there's evidence ample for this
24:40 that there's a threshold of intelligence
24:42 that when you reach that intelligence
24:44 your reward from the universe that is
24:47 playing out the opportunities for you to
24:49 take advantage of might just be hobbled
24:53 this party music that happens around you
24:56 when life is going well and ignorance is
24:58 bliss you always find a girlfriend yo
25:00 he's found a boyfriend you always find a
25:02 great job and it's a job that you want
25:04 to do not just any job but you love it
25:07 anyway you love where you live you love
25:09 the smell of the air you reach a certain
25:12 level of intelligence and it goes quiet
25:15 it's not dark I mean it's not
25:18 necessarily negative it's benign you are
25:22 in a room by yourself now when you get
25:27 intelligent you'll definitely feel that
25:29 room effect around you no matter what
25:30 your opportunities are in this world
25:33 because you won't have to be able to
25:35 have these conversations with other
25:36 folks and I think that that's why this
25:39 show exists that's why everyone listens
25:41 because you like to find each other
25:43 we're having deeper conversations and
25:45 most folks and we're loving it
25:48 and how can I create 500 episodes
25:50 effortlessly because there's that many
25:52 things to talk about and it's constantly
25:55 evolving now what are the immediate
25:58 counter arguments to such a theory well
26:02 someone might say well where did you
26:05 come up with that theory
26:06 are you experiencing this yourself and
26:08 maybe it's just you're in a lull in life
26:11 and therefore you're making up this
26:15 theory to compensate for perhaps just to
26:20 dip in your life hmm I didn't get this
26:23 idea necessarily from my own life but I
26:26 definitely experienced that for sure
26:29 some people say well some people might
26:32 say well there's a lot of brilliant
26:33 people out there that are living the
26:35 most charm life in the world and Michael
26:38 by eight comments you is is it really
26:41 that brilliant I mean there's a lot of
26:43 really rich people that sell pet rocks
26:45 you know the equivalent of something
26:47 silly that no one needs but marketing
26:50 departments make us feel good maybe
26:52 something fun there's a lot of
26:54 rich drug dealers is that a brilliant
26:57 product SpaceX got Elon Musk well is he
27:02 he's definitely brilliant on one level
27:04 but all he's doing is he's got a
27:06 rebranded he like a rebuilt redesigned
27:09 French rocket which he pans pawns off
27:12 like he convened its rate obviously all
27:14 these boosters all these fuse that's
27:16 ancient technology by the time SpaceX
27:19 starts a cyber truck a Tesla
27:23 come on he went first but ask any
27:26 engineer what's easier to build a
27:28 combustion engine or an electrical
27:30 engine hmm obviously certain aspects of
27:35 these inventions present their unique
27:37 challenges but I'm not talking about
27:40 that what I would say is pretty low
27:42 hanging fruit inventions I'm talking
27:46 about folks that figure out how the
27:50 universe works where energy comes from
27:53 because they figured out where the
27:54 universe works
27:56 what is the story of Nikola Tesla
28:00 perhaps one of the most academically
28:02 intelligent human beings on planet Earth
28:06 well how did his life go he had come up
28:11 with this theory of alternating current
28:13 before he came to the United States he
28:16 comes over in the 1870s he's going to
28:20 work for Edison his plan is to convince
28:23 Edison of something he thinks is a
28:25 logical evolution in the generation of
28:27 electricity which is AC alternating
28:29 current but Edison is a thousand percent
28:33 committed to direct current and
28:34 absolutely has no patience to go back to
28:39 zero even though Tesla already had it
28:42 figured out as to how to create it and I
28:46 believe there was some alternating
28:47 current proof before Tesla moved over
28:52 here but he made it possible to do it
28:54 and made it economical and made it work
28:56 for electric so electric circuits and so
28:59 he was really the difference between it
29:01 beget a reality and it just being a
29:03 theory now we know the story of Tesla
29:08 he went through all kinds of phases of
29:12 incredible celebration and success the
29:14 Roll Fair in Paris I believe where he
29:17 lit the whole place with alternating
29:18 current he went on stage and did one of
29:21 his infamous shows where he surrounded
29:23 himself and a basically a cocoon of
29:28 plasma energy something that under most
29:31 circumstances for any one of us if we
29:33 tried that at home we would turn into a
29:35 little shark it of ourselves we would be
29:39 dead instantaneously but he so
29:42 understood ether as he documented that
29:45 he was able to play with fire and get
29:50 away with it now think about it
29:54 he opened the colonel code of the matrix
30:00 if you want to go on a biblical sense he
30:04 literally got the how to do it yourself
30:07 guide from God he was destined to reach
30:12 a point where no one could stop this guy
30:17 we think about all these inventions that
30:20 we have today like you know 3d printers
30:23 but 3d printers can 3d printers have
30:27 been invented on a nano level at this
30:29 point an atomic level the quantum
30:34 computers he would have eaten that thing
30:37 alive we also have what Alan Turing what
30:43 was his life like he was going to be
30:46 chemically castrated because he was a
30:48 homosexual he eventually took his life
30:51 because they kept chasing him around
30:53 because of his sexual orientation but
30:56 what if someone says well what about
30:57 Einstein and you haven't seen episode
31:01 400 well he was a fraud if you were
31:06 passing along fraudulent science the Big
31:09 Bang
31:11 Dark Matter black holes as I always say
31:14 then you can go forever
31:16 because you're misleading the entire
31:18 population of the matrix and essentially
31:21 you are aiding the coders and making
31:23 sure that no one ever finds out that
31:25 they're actually characters in a book
31:27 that potentially could escape if nothing
31:31 else maybe escaping is a silly way of
31:33 saying it because potentially we are
31:35 entities that cannot escape just like
31:36 characters in a book but they don't want
31:39 us to become self-aware of where we are
31:41 now
31:42 Tesla is again is romanticized as dying
31:46 in his apartment in New York penniless
31:48 and all this other stuff I don't buy
31:50 that
31:50 I mean he lived in his 80s okay not
31:53 exactly a failure not physically not
31:56 financially not mentally he was hit by a
31:59 car and then he died as a result of his
32:02 injuries so that seems a little suspect
32:05 that could he have been assassinated oh
32:08 yeah oh yeah I mean the list of people
32:10 that would like him off the planet is
32:13 damn near infinite it would be add up
32:17 all the bankers add up all these
32:19 theoretical hack scientists like
32:20 Einstein and then add up any monarchies
32:23 that's a banker through proxy of being
32:26 anointed by a lady in the lake right but
32:30 I want to submit that the more that we
32:33 pierce this veil of consciousness and
32:37 reality may look at this channel here's
32:39 I don't mean to whine and I don't mean
32:42 to make excuses but this channel only
32:44 has 4300 subscribers at this point it's
32:47 been around for five years
32:49 there are queue and on pages that have
32:55 250,000 they've only been around for two
32:57 years I should tell you something about
33:01 where the mind is maybe useful
33:05 information but not going to threatened
33:09 our position in their matrix it's not
33:12 going to threaten perhaps God's
33:14 experiment which is no no no you're not
33:16 supposed to leave the maze man you're
33:19 supposed to stay in the maze that's why
33:20 I made it they'll be thinking about how
33:23 to get out now I'm gonna throw some
33:26 props to my Flat Earth folks and globish
33:32 don't get all upset because this is a
33:33 very different thing I'm going to say
33:35 then
33:35 you probably prophesize but I the
33:39 comment I get a lot and people don't
33:41 know which is really funny I'm in an
33:43 episode that's called the space exists a
33:45 long time ago and that episode was me
33:50 saying this way before but earth was
33:52 ever out there on YouTube it was based
33:56 on the idea that I have tons of friends
33:59 in CG and Hollywood aka television who
34:04 do space simulation constantly and asked
34:07 my co-host Kyle from MKULTRA Rita which
34:10 no longer exists he's a two-time Emmy
34:13 award-winning space cg cameramen I said
34:19 Kyle have you ever dreamed of being in
34:20 space I mean you stare at screens all
34:23 day you have spaceships all day long and
34:25 Kyle puts the cameras in space to shoot
34:28 the scenes he's the director in space
34:30 he's a very coveted role in Hollywood
34:35 because most the folks are you know
34:37 either animators modelers textured folks
34:41 and they don't do the camp work and
34:44 colic to me he goes no I said well how's
34:49 that even possible do you're staring at
34:51 this 12 hours a day sometimes 14 hours a
34:54 day
34:54 I mean he worked on you know serenity
34:59 and the show that made serenity open
35:00 shop name escapes because I never
35:02 watched it he worked on all the
35:03 Battlestar Galactica he worked on some
35:05 of the star tracks he's done all kinds
35:06 of stuff he's finishing up on Top Gun
35:11 now he goes to work because we're
35:14 shooting the show in 2014 to 2015 and he
35:18 asks all his buddies dudes have you ever
35:20 dreamed of space what do you mean have
35:22 you dreamed of being in space and one of
35:24 our spaceships living in space being in
35:26 space floating in space everyone looked
35:29 at each other they went no huh well did
35:35 any of the hosts in Westworld think
35:37 about being outside of Westworld know
35:42 one of the first episodes of Westworld
35:45 girl Pixar know though what was it
35:49 the lorises father finds a photograph
35:52 that someone dropped on the ground of
35:53 the outside it was a picture of like San
35:57 Francisco or New York or something and
36:00 he's looking at the picture it's a woman
36:02 and there's a cars in the background
36:04 it's a nighttime city shot and he stares
36:07 at her all night long on the patio and
36:08 he shows it to his daughter and she
36:10 looks at it and she is ah doesn't look
36:12 like anything to me Danny
36:14 that's the catalyst of the entire show
36:18 it's the first season isn't it
36:22 interesting then and I've told you guys
36:26 before that when I conceive of being in
36:28 space and I sit and consciously set up
36:30 and conceive of it in my own mind
36:32 traveling in it being out there and I
36:34 worked when a game called Earth and
36:35 Beyond for a year which was an MMO out
36:39 of West world at Westwood Studios owned
36:41 by EA that was traveling and being in
36:44 space it was EVE online before EVE
36:45 Online existed I had probably spent half
36:49 my day flying in space because that was
36:51 the slowest part of the game I never
36:54 dreamed of it I've been a cosmologists
36:57 since I was like I don't know I would
37:01 say deep you know two bucks to books a
37:04 month from a book club and studying at
37:07 hardcore on my personal time you
37:08 creating a unified theory by the age of
37:10 21 so I've been in this game for a
37:14 really long time I've sat around concede
37:16 this I've seen every Star Trek episode
37:18 four times from 1967 all the way up to
37:22 2005 when Enterprise was cancelled I
37:25 will not watch Discovery sorry estrogen
37:29 and space I mean they should have taken
37:32 a lesson from Voyager if they wanted to
37:34 put powerful woman in space never had a
37:38 dream I hope used to sit and binge watch
37:41 that while I was programming episode
37:44 after episode I never dreamed of being
37:45 on the Star Trek Enterprise I know you
37:47 get me I'm just giving you more examples
37:49 okay there are many concepts like that
37:53 that are tough to conceive some of you
37:58 claim to ask for a project and one way
38:00 or another you asked your project
38:03 interesting you're starting to break the
38:05 mold if you do that Tesla literally
38:09 lived that life that I'm talking about
38:12 he's the most relevant man on planet
38:14 Earth in 2019 2020 the wireless
38:18 technology we use him every single piece
38:20 of light and power that makes this show
38:23 happen is him had he had his way he
38:27 would have created the death ray which
38:29 wasn't to kill humans but it was to kill
38:31 is to melt all the Steel's a
38:33 directed-energy weapon now whether or
38:35 not he had time travel that kind of
38:37 stuff there's not a single ounce of
38:39 evidence that he ever created a machine
38:41 that did it he talked about it happening
38:43 in Colorado Springs as I've said in
38:44 several episodes recently but instead of
38:47 taking a guy like Tesla who should be
38:52 the Einstein Einstein should have been
38:55 knowing they should have realized he's a
38:56 third-rate patent clerk you know his his
39:00 maxim of intelligence would be to
39:02 understand perhaps maybe if all of his
39:05 synapse were running in his brain how a
39:06 ki tumbles the combination inside of a
39:08 lock and a door that's about the maximum
39:11 amount of conceptual thought this guy
39:13 could come up with everything else he
39:14 stole Tesla should have a statue bigger
39:19 than the Statue of Liberty and it should
39:22 be built by the entire world's funds
39:24 because the entire world world operates
39:28 on Tesla technology right now your home
39:31 wireless network Tesla had we not as
39:37 well had the bankers not ganked his
39:43 antenna we would have no wires in the
39:47 world at all for anything not for
39:49 transmitting data and not for
39:51 transmitting electricity electricity we
39:53 have no power cables anywhere I got a
39:55 tons of wires all around me right now
39:57 none of this would exist
39:59 had he been put on the pedestal that he
40:02 should have been put on
40:05 a threshold it seems as if he hit a
40:08 threshold and all of his opportunities
40:10 disappeared
40:11 now you may just say look dude you just
40:13 mentioned all of the cause and effect
40:15 situations that stopped him
40:18 the bankers defunded him they stole his
40:21 AC patents right it was Price Waterhouse
40:23 lost all his money to JP Morgan JP
40:28 Morgan kills the antenna in 1927 but
40:32 where there's a will there's a way
40:34 so JP Morgan won't finance the antenna
40:37 okay go talk to somebody else he's not
40:41 stupid
40:42 but those opportunities didn't reveal
40:44 themselves and opportunities are you
40:46 know it's usually the luck of the draw
40:48 that you meet someone that can give you
40:51 the opportunity in life but you have to
40:53 have the skills to deliver the bills
40:55 right and so the idea is you would have
40:59 serendipitously by giving shows to Mark
41:01 Twain another elite folks of the time
41:05 someone would have walked in the room
41:07 and said okay what's next man money just
41:11 goes I need a million dollars to get the
41:13 next and someone's gonna go I know it's
41:16 a lot of money in 1930 or whatever but
41:19 I'll find it yeah sure what are we gonna
41:21 get Oh broadcast electricity everywhere
41:24 and then we're gonna make a bunch of
41:25 inventions and we're gonna patent the
41:27 perhaps the little units that receive
41:29 this free electricity and as we build
41:32 these towers the towers cost money we're
41:34 gonna sell those it's a multi-billion
41:36 dollar business even in the 20s someone
41:39 would have jumped on that JP Morgan go
41:41 go [ __ ] himself because the thing is if
41:44 you're an inventor and let's say you
41:45 invent the pliers and you work for Sears
41:49 or Black & Decker or something right and
41:55 they say we're not going to fund this
41:56 next thing you're coming up with which
41:58 of the Weisse groups you just quit you
42:01 don't tell them about the vise grip so
42:02 you go make device groups by yourself
42:04 then you find an investor to help you
42:06 manufacture them never giving them the
42:08 ownership of the patent but cutting the
42:10 middle of the profit once they finance
42:11 the factory once you read Tesla's
42:14 writings about his life you will find
42:17 out he was
42:18 way more intelligent than that little
42:20 basic business model Turing what was his
42:25 big thing Alan Turing's thing was
42:29 artificial intelligence he was coming
42:32 with artificial intelligence at a time
42:34 when computers were as big as warehouses
42:36 that they took forever to calculate
42:39 something that is now in your average
42:41 tiny tiny calculator that's free now I
42:45 will say on record I'm a huge fan of
42:47 Alan Turing have been in my whole life
42:50 studied the Turing tests in the 80s the
42:54 Turing test is really without creating
42:57 levels of the Turing test it is not hard
43:01 to satisfy the initial Turing test that
43:03 he came up with and so we have to add
43:05 more probability and statistical
43:08 analysis to make sure that this
43:10 artificial intelligence truly behaves
43:12 like a creative human for me a Turing
43:15 test would be write me a poem right now
43:18 write me that's very meaningful to me
43:21 and maybe given us some parameters and
43:23 it actually writes a great poem or
43:24 writes a movie that's funny
43:26 or dramatic or an action-packed scene
43:29 it's not full of cliche archetypes that
43:32 have got us some other lookup table
43:34 right but I will tell you that the story
43:38 of Alan Turing and the Enigma machine
43:41 you will find out that a whole thing was
43:44 faked I know it's a romantic it's a
43:47 great movie with cumberpatch when my
43:48 favorite actors in the entire world but
43:50 you will find out that that entire story
43:53 is a total story the boy was at an era
43:57 of stories right and the thing is is um
44:02 the Epiphany that will strike you once
44:05 you do a little bit of research into
44:06 that I think even Wikipedia calls this
44:08 out but as definitely was in the credits
44:10 where the epilogue on the movie was that
44:13 because this was so secretive and so
44:17 powerful that as soon as they cracked
44:19 the Enigma machine they destroyed the
44:23 computer that he built there's no
44:25 evidence of it ever existing and there's
44:27 no evidence of the project there's no
44:29 paperwork
44:31 yeah yeah cuz that's what you do
44:34 I mean seriously after that machine was
44:36 created you take it to the next level
44:37 and a next level to create massive
44:38 decryption capabilities what Britain
44:41 didn't want to admit is that they were
44:43 in on Hitler and there was other ways of
44:46 getting the information we hope you know
44:48 America and England helped build all his
44:50 entire empire because when we
44:52 disassembled the guns and the tanks and
44:54 the airplanes they have all these
44:55 American and British parts in them again
44:57 Prescott Bush funded Hitler till 1942
45:00 until the British government rolled into
45:03 the Union Bank of London said stop
45:04 cutting this to checks would you which
45:07 probably meant they simply moved it more
45:08 underground but you're looking at your
45:11 simulator your matrix I would make a
45:15 cabin in the woods analogy but I want to
45:16 run that movie for anyone but you would
45:19 see this human whatever you want to call
45:23 this little character in this simulation
45:25 be it God or something like that and one
45:30 way to do it would be to say well let's
45:32 just make Tesla and Turing not want to
45:36 do this stuff and then they'll just kind
45:39 of wake up the next day and they'll want
45:41 to collect bundai trees write whatever
45:45 they want to raise dogs for living but
45:48 perhaps in almost a prime directive
45:54 protocol because whoever sustains us be
46:00 it God or a matrix program AI even maybe
46:04 made us I mean can you imagine that were
46:05 the product of an AI that they won't
46:11 mess with our destiny the inside of our
46:14 mind is our mind in our sovereign
46:16 property but they have to and perhaps we
46:18 all agreed on this before we came down
46:20 here you know if you get too smart we're
46:22 gonna have to mess up your life right
46:24 and maybe we sit there like some marine
46:27 about to jump off into some space world
46:29 we go yeah I'm gonna make sure that's my
46:32 goal so you're gonna have to stop me
46:34 because I'm gonna get so smart in this
46:36 world you're gonna have to gank me
46:38 staiin myers created a engine that ran
46:41 on water go look up my episode on stayin
46:44 myers i forgot the exact it's in i
46:46 believe the last part of last season
46:51 he's a gentleman they figured out how to
46:53 perforate hydrogen out of tap water
46:55 we've had a complex fuel so dirty old
46:59 house water no problem proved it took it
47:03 to oxford university proved it half an
47:05 amp to 650 amps of electricity Wow
47:09 pretty amazing they killed him they gave
47:14 him some cranberry juice and killed him
47:17 two investors were across the table took
47:20 the sip ran out the door fell on his
47:23 face and died and they said they
47:26 poisoned me was his last words well free
47:30 energy think about it now is plenty of
47:33 oil theories for that one but perhaps
47:36 the method by which you perish or suffer
47:38 and maybe suffer is even too strong of a
47:41 word you stall your wheel spin and you
47:46 can't get it to go anywhere hmm maybe
47:49 that's what it is
47:50 who knows what the effects are but there
47:54 are countless people have gone through
47:55 this algorithm before where we were even
47:57 born and what's interesting is is
48:01 typically when you take someone's life
48:06 and you assess it the Tesla's of the
48:09 world Tesla was a good man a good
48:13 genuine man as good as a human being
48:17 gets he was never associated with any
48:20 sort of crime of any kind
48:22 he was never unkind to people he was
48:25 eccentric he definitely had an ADHD
48:27 thing which he talked about we didn't
48:30 have a name for it but he was a
48:31 compulsive person so we put you know
48:35 lawful good and his DND little
48:38 orientation but what do you do with the
48:42 people where do you put the people that
48:44 ganked him unlawful bad or evil bad a JP
48:49 Morgan who was a proxy to the
48:52 chuckles he died with two and a half
48:54 million dollars to his name but
48:56 according to the lore of his life he
48:58 should have had hundreds of millions if
49:00 not a couple billion to his name he sold
49:04 out so that he could wear his little top
49:06 hat not to be remembered in history as a
49:09 hero but as a villain and that's the way
49:12 it goes
49:13 for Turing it was the British government
49:16 and those that would support this Hey
49:19 Turing's sexual orientation had no
49:22 effect on anyone else's life in a
49:23 negative way but because people didn't
49:26 understand how to deal with that
49:27 supposedly they had passed this chemical
49:30 castration law if you were caught
49:32 engaging in homosexual activities they
49:36 had to spy on him to catch him that's
49:38 how tough it was it wasn't like in the
49:41 middle of you know London Square and
49:44 doing this stuff doing the privacy of
49:46 his own home do you even feel like you
49:48 have the right to know what he was doing
49:49 no but they nailed him now let me ask
49:53 you let's go to stay in Meyers bed again
49:59 oil oil industry most likely you know
50:01 provided the mechanism to kill Stan
50:03 Meyers no doubt JP Morgan provided the
50:07 means of defunding Tesla because he was
50:10 going to wipe out their energy market
50:13 Einstein tried to dissolve the the
50:17 factual sciences of ether such that no
50:22 one could ever find or get on Tesla's
50:24 path ever again turning he was so ahead
50:28 of his time as long as he was dead they
50:31 could usurp his technology usurped his
50:34 programming wait 40 years to turn it
50:36 back on again and they just want the DoD
50:40 to go first
50:41 then you can have little tiny scraps on
50:43 the bottom but if I said to you right
50:47 now in this video I've got a new
50:50 invention that makes tap water
50:51 electricity or a combustible turbine
50:55 that can spin a AC motor and create
50:58 electricity again it's it's a bad
51:00 alternative for what Tesla was going to
51:02 give us but you do need to carry usually
51:05 a few
51:05 Supply on you if you're a jet your car
51:08 moving quickly you do need that power
51:10 supply on hand and relying on a
51:11 transmission tower to send electricity
51:14 to an electric motor turbine on a plane
51:17 at 30,000 feet going 550 miles an hour I
51:20 wouldn't trust that personally something
51:23 could happen I could fall out of the sky
51:25 no thank you
51:26 I need the fuel on board but if I proved
51:29 it which should happen in a rational
51:33 matrix and rational world of any kind
51:36 supported by a creator that wants you to
51:38 go to your apex of existence would be
51:41 that I should be national news on every
51:43 rag in the world so and so his backyard
51:47 created this motor published the recipe
51:50 now the entire world could just make
51:52 this equipment he tells you where to buy
51:55 all the parts but it wouldn't happen
51:58 that way would it stay and Meyer said
52:01 his engine proved it I believe ABC
52:04 Gallo's little spot on ABC no one ever
52:09 heard of this guy yet you know he's dead
52:11 he's been dead for 22 years and people
52:13 still don't know who he was huh seems
52:18 like there's a threshold seems like
52:21 there would be a very logical thing to
52:23 make sure that that threshold was
52:25 enforced so now let's take it to the
52:28 next stage we're at the deep thoughts
52:31 University we're in this heavy new
52:33 division that we've created there is
52:35 investigating whether or not this is
52:37 actually just a matter of coincidence
52:39 which it could be or if this could be
52:42 somehow tested what would be the very
52:46 first thing that we would do I think we
52:51 would look at the common denominator of
52:53 this theory what is the common
52:56 denominator of this theory hmm I'm gonna
53:00 name three people Nikola Tesla Allen
53:04 turning stay and Meyers Nikola Tesla
53:08 never married Alan Turing never married
53:12 now if Stan Myers was married I'm
53:15 unaware of it but maybe he was but
53:17 they're very isolated people
53:20 especially with Tori turning in Tesla
53:22 tuti names isn't that cool maybe that's
53:25 the thing so what we would do and our
53:28 University with a little bit of funding
53:30 would be to scour the world and try to
53:34 find the next Buddha of this technology
53:38 find them find what they are creating
53:42 that is going to change the world
53:44 thus giving us more control and freedom
53:48 in the end freedom from what though I
53:51 would say freedom from the very fabric
53:54 of the universe itself the matrix or if
53:58 you believe in determinism or aka God's
54:01 plan you could start to throw the
54:05 almighty himself for a loop which I
54:08 think would probably be very
54:09 entertaining if a god existed that you
54:12 know Michelangelo painting God who's got
54:16 a bunch of anger issues but we would
54:19 find the individual protect them and
54:23 empower them what do you need do you
54:27 need time by yourself
54:28 we've got in our fictitious College of
54:31 course we would have experts of every
54:33 single science and have open minded
54:36 scientists to say okay I'm sure going to
54:38 throw something at us that we haven't
54:39 thought of before but instead of
54:41 fighting you like a bunch of mentally
54:44 handicapped scientists which seem to run
54:46 the world today we're here to support
54:50 you if you say something we don't
54:52 understand that's just fine we'll ask
54:53 you again until you get us get it
54:55 explained at least to one of us then you
54:57 can go back to your work and the one of
54:59 us that gets what you're saying confirm
55:01 by cross-referencing your explanation
55:05 will teach the rest of us and if you
55:08 want to send us off on a particular wing
55:10 of your research because one thing has
55:12 to be researched you haven't had time to
55:14 do it we'll go do our best assess the
55:15 information perhaps we can't deduce it
55:18 but we'll bring it to that individual
55:19 and have them to do so here's all the
55:21 options we found in the Rubik's Cube
55:22 which way do we go now wouldn't it be
55:26 interesting if we were to pull that
55:27 experiment and all of us start having
55:31 right
55:32 block we have research block we have
55:37 theoretical conception block we just
55:40 can't solve these simple things right in
55:42 front of our face I mean we can feel
55:44 there's something there but just like
55:46 the hosts in West world it doesn't look
55:49 like anything to us but we know it's
55:51 there for those of you that research
55:53 flat earth and by the way I want to give
55:56 you guys another piece of footage you
55:59 can play with for those of you that know
56:01 how to D fisheye footage I don't think I
56:07 have anything the deficient VR software
56:09 actually started the probably does it
56:10 but there's a show called it only ran
56:12 for two seasons four episodes of piece
56:15 is called man lab you can find on Amazon
56:18 Prime for free in the third episode of
56:21 second season they did an experiment but
56:24 they did a funny thing it's actually one
56:25 of the best episodes ever made they got
56:28 the idea because they come up with these
56:29 really funny things to do or they got a
56:32 cremated cat and a cremated bird from
56:35 the owners and they built weather
56:41 balloons where they shoved the ashes
56:43 into the balloon and then one of them
56:45 did with helium want him did it with
56:46 hydrogen and they sent it way up with
56:48 these great GoPro cameras attached to it
56:50 and they went 1-1 about 25,000 meters
56:55 and one way 30,000 meters up before the
56:58 thing exploded and all the footage
57:01 survived I mean it was the most perfect
57:03 versions of these high-altitude balloons
57:06 but they had the most incredible footage
57:08 of the earth at these incredibly high
57:11 rates so they they were able to get
57:15 about eighty thousand feet with the
57:18 hydrogen one and you could take that
57:21 footage that they have and if you're
57:23 aware of the distortion and you've seen
57:26 it several times get corrected you can
57:28 do it in your brain it's as flat as hell
57:30 at 80,000 feet now I'm telling you have
57:32 to go 80 miles up but a thousand feet
57:35 it's pretty good for all these people
57:36 that tell you oh man I can see curvature
57:38 out of a plane we all know no that's
57:40 [ __ ] but even back to you flat
57:43 earthers I know plenty of you that are
57:45 trying to get the other
57:47 the real proof I'm a proof proof proof
57:50 please keep going we need to know either
57:53 way but haven't you found it interesting
57:56 that just debating this and talking to
58:00 the people the especially get angry so
58:03 that group which I think is a fairly
58:04 small group but you have a ton of people
58:06 that just look at you like you're nuts
58:08 like they don't you understand the words
58:09 coming out of your mouth they're a host
58:10 and that's what it feels like to be at
58:14 your level
58:14 you've now conceived as something that
58:16 is threatening the very fabric of this
58:18 existence you could believe in Jesus
58:21 Christ and the the biblical God out of
58:23 Rome and that guy would still probably
58:26 go yeah you know don't don't get to the
58:29 dome edge please don't do that because
58:31 then everybody's gonna go to the edge
58:34 and then you guys won't be productive
58:36 anymore like I need you to or like we
58:38 agreed this place should be set up as
58:40 and so I'm gonna have to flood the place
58:41 again and in the matrix who knows they
58:46 do like a Dark City update at night I
58:47 don't know but now I did an episode that
58:52 was I don't think it was as understood
58:57 as some folks hoped it was going to be I
59:00 mean it wasn't it wasn't profound that
59:02 you didn't understand what I was saying
59:03 but you were looking for one target and
59:06 I went a different way which is the NPC
59:08 discussion
59:09 now the lowbrow NPC discussion is that
59:12 all these Mockingbird journalists like
59:16 Anderson Cooper who's a van der ball
59:18 grandson did his internship at the CIA
59:20 who had the Mockingbird project in the
59:22 50s that Rod Serling talked about in his
59:23 only interview in 1959 before Twilight
59:26 Zone launched that's that's the one
59:30 that's banned on the internet if you
59:32 start posting memes with those little
59:33 npc grey guys you know your count gets
59:35 suspended because again there's just
59:36 mysterious force that doesn't want you
59:38 to wake up right but the npc thing I
59:41 brought you was that going back to our
59:44 original example at the beginning of the
59:46 episode it seems as though if specially
59:50 if you were Christian religion you have
59:51 to concede that the devil is completely
59:53 taking this planet over you are living
59:55 in a prison cell of the devil with hopes
59:58 that Christ is going to come
59:59 back and reset this place Wow that's
60:03 sort of weird right if this is God
60:05 watching this all occur then we're in a
60:07 we're in a really bad day care with
60:09 pedophiles running around all kinds of
60:11 other [ __ ] so I tend not to believe
60:13 that's the way it rolls but if we go to
60:15 the matrix side of the game well that's
60:19 the NPC's a totally different thing it's
60:21 more what I'm saying
60:22 we know that choice is important to us
60:25 right when you write a movie the classic
60:28 basic controlling idea of a hero before
60:33 you get to your controlling idea of your
60:35 script is a hero is defined by the
60:37 decisions they make under pressure but
60:41 what's a decision a decision is a choice
60:44 now maybe a choice is simply between a
60:49 hot fudge sundae and a strawberry sundae
60:53 two good things and you can make a
60:55 choice but we know life isn't like that
60:58 right life is a bunch of hard choices
61:00 what's teeny tiny hard choices not a lot
61:02 of big ones your life is made out of
61:04 millions of teeny ones well they're
61:08 usually good ones and bad ones one leads
61:11 to your destiny one doesn't damn I had a
61:13 50/50 chance to get in this right
61:15 that's why data gathering is really
61:17 important and you're making decisions
61:19 pausing before you impulsively make a
61:21 decision is another attribute of getting
61:22 older what if I might have mentioned X
61:27 minus one episode that I talked about a
61:29 long time ago what if as the designers
61:32 of this universe being us we said well
61:36 choice is really big deal because choice
61:39 allows us to take ownership of our own
61:41 destiny we don't have choice we're in a
61:42 deterministic world God's plan and no
61:45 matter what we do it's a bore fest of
61:47 okay oh I'm supposed to die in this car
61:50 wreck oh yeah I'm supposed to get
61:51 divorced you know you can't do that to
61:53 yourself it's our choice but we have to
61:58 create characters that are evil in order
62:02 to have good now let me hit you with
62:06 this I'm gonna say to you this
62:11 if we create a level of good that is
62:17 level one I compliment you you look
62:20 really nice today then what has to
62:23 immediately manifest in the universe of
62:25 our matrix especially as the program we
62:28 have to say someone goes and you look
62:30 horrible in a bad way not a friend who
62:35 is concerned now take every level up
62:39 that life has as a reward having a baby
62:44 is one of the most amazing rewarding
62:46 things you can ever have happen to your
62:48 life hopefully
62:50 well the birth of a child is then
62:54 mirrored by the death of a child perhaps
62:57 just the death of anyone but definitely
62:59 the amazing feeling you have when your
63:01 baby comes out and you get to hold it
63:03 for the first time and then the death of
63:04 a child has got to be pretty
63:07 proportionate to each other
63:09 so for every level of success that one
63:12 can achieve before this threshold is met
63:14 where you start getting this stalling of
63:17 your airplane going straight up it's not
63:19 a metaphor take those old biplanes or
63:21 even a jet you fly straight up up
63:24 meaning enlightened what happens the
63:27 atmosphere doesn't help you out at a
63:29 point and the plane starts to stall and
63:31 no matter how much thrust you put in
63:33 this thing
63:33 it's gone back down and then it's really
63:38 hard to operate to get control over it
63:40 again unless you're a stunt pilot right
63:42 so what if all these bad characters in
63:46 the world are simply put there
63:49 automatically how is it that we have a
63:54 lot of people that don't seem to have
63:56 this is really funny for some of you
64:00 their origins are mysterious we have a
64:06 former president United States who
64:08 sealed his own records the day after he
64:12 became president his birth records his
64:15 previous records the only person history
64:18 that I know has ever had to do that as
64:19 Adolf Hitler because he was a Rothschild
64:23 grandson his father was a Rothschild son
64:26 he was the son of his father and so he's
64:29 a Rothschild to remember those who don't
64:32 know the history his mother was a maid
64:34 at a Rothschild mansion unmarried was
64:36 impregnated was sent to Austria to have
64:38 his father and as soon as Hitler hit 18
64:42 he disappears at one point but he's in a
64:44 region where a little bunch of
64:45 Rothschilds live and then he pops out
64:47 and he's written mancom fudge is this
64:51 big socialistic thing and now he's he
64:54 takes Germany from absolute destitution
64:57 1935 by 1939 he is the biggest army
65:00 that's ever been amassed on planet Earth
65:02 in three years history even bigger than
65:05 the United States has ever amassed in
65:07 three years and he kicks everyone's ass
65:09 in Europe you might wonder why the do
65:13 you think happened it may not have been
65:15 what you thought it was we're still
65:17 gathering data bunch of new data is
65:19 released in the last couple of years
65:20 about this dude dr. Haney was good but
65:25 we typically have these weirdos or they
65:28 hatch themselves out of thin air no one
65:30 knew they ever existed and then boom
65:32 they exist and they have these back
65:33 stories hmm interesting
65:37 what if enemy I'm gonna do an episode
65:41 about the fact that space does exist and
65:45 that these satellites are starting to
65:46 become the control apparatus on us and
65:48 the level of which these satellites are
65:51 starting to control humanity is going to
65:55 be off the chain in 20 years meaning my
65:58 manipulation all kinds of horrific [ __ ]
66:00 we all we know that they can
66:02 disintegrate stuff from space they can
66:05 anything will be done on earth can be
66:07 done from space and you'd be very
66:08 careful about that
66:09 so the SIOP could be well before we
66:12 install Skynet
66:14 we're gonna hatch a conspiracy that will
66:17 get a ton of people not to believe that
66:19 this is possible and those folks believe
66:22 it or not are gonna be the ones that are
66:23 coddled to live long and the ones that
66:26 believe in science and space they're
66:29 gonna be a race because they're gonna
66:30 know how this tech works just sayin
66:34 but if I was running a matrix program
66:37 you would definitely have quest givers
66:39 in PCs now tonight at my lounge
66:45 my buddy Vance he runs a place he played
66:49 one of my favorite movies of all time
66:51 and it's literally my favorite Tom
66:53 Cruise movie ever made which was edge of
66:57 tomorrow if you have not seen edge of
67:00 tomorrow you need to see as your
67:03 tomorrow I will say that there's a bit
67:07 of a Groundhog Day element to that story
67:10 and it is quite frankly a perfect script
67:13 there's a perfect script from all
67:15 categories of what you can achieve in
67:18 the two hours or two and half hours that
67:20 it ran but what do you there was a point
67:24 at the what I call the fourth act Holly
67:27 what else is the third act the end of
67:30 the movie towards the in the movie where
67:34 it addresses the issue of this and I've
67:39 talked about this on one of my episodes
67:40 I think it was called one with the
67:42 universe something like that but it's
67:45 about the idea that you know if you look
67:51 at the world the matrix program let's
67:53 just say or God's plan from the
67:56 perspective of a human being
67:58 you can get very upset with your life
68:01 even if it's been a wonderful life but
68:04 you can get upset especially if it's a
68:05 bad life especially if it's a bad life
68:07 and you can see my god you know I got
68:10 beaten as a kid and so my childhood
68:12 sucked but all my friends in the great
68:15 neighborhood that I lived in their
68:16 parents were cool they didn't drink and
68:18 get drunk and beat me up and they
68:20 remember the child and they want to
68:21 remember their childhood and they go
68:22 back to the high school reunions because
68:24 people are nice to them but if you were
68:27 awkward maybe you don't go back as it's
68:28 like it just reminds you of pain it was
68:31 so weird about my personal friend Circle
68:33 I've got folks that have had some pretty
68:37 horrific [ __ ] happen to them in their
68:38 middle school in high school and they
68:41 still go back to the reunion and I got
68:42 other friends that had
68:44 were rock stars in middle school in high
68:46 school and they won't come to the
68:49 reunion it's where they live in the town
68:51 with the reunion I have to travel 1,800
68:53 miles go to my reunion one guy one guy
68:56 simply won't go to the reunion because
68:58 on the first reunion by the first
69:00 reunion he was bald but he had the great
69:04 head of hair and then he just lost it
69:06 all like really super fast and so he
69:08 wouldn't show up and one of his good
69:10 friends murmured on the on the float
69:12 when we were on our float with our whole
69:13 class because it's a tiny school tiny
69:16 town you said yeah you won't come cause
69:18 he lost his hair we're sitting there
69:21 going okay I understand your 20s but how
69:24 about your 30s and your 40s and your 50s
69:26 and almost you know half the guys lost
69:28 all their hair like don't worry about it
69:30 man it's like we love you won't want to
69:31 talk to you and see you and shake your
69:33 hand give you a hug you know it's like
69:34 relax dude it's really weird but I don't
69:38 think any human being contests the
69:41 absolute uselessness of jealousy I just
69:45 did an episode on this this year should
69:47 you should watch it trust me it's deeper
69:48 than you think but why do we know that
69:52 the jealousy is useless we know it's a
69:55 flaw in our system in our current
69:58 incarnation to feel jealousy envy it
70:01 means you want something that someone
70:03 else has it's never it could be there
70:06 there looks to be their intelligence
70:08 they'll be a little more metaphysical a
70:09 lot of times it's their car or their
70:11 house their wives their kids or whatever
70:13 they got balanced you didn't in in yes
70:15 per your definition of all those things
70:18 but now what if this particular instance
70:24 of this matrix this program you actually
70:28 are playing all the characters not all
70:32 at once linearly in your consciousness
70:34 but you're coming back to be Tom Cruise
70:36 to be you know I know that we have this
70:40 orientation problem in the world but
70:42 you're all the girls and you're all the
70:44 guys you're everything you do everything
70:46 the good the bad and the ugly man at
70:49 that point it's all moot and you don't
70:54 be angry with your god because you had a
70:56 bad
70:57 and you know I said am i my one with the
71:01 universe episode that you might have so
71:07 much steak and ice cream and shrimp and
71:12 lobster and whatever you love to eat
71:14 sushi whatever is your food of choice
71:18 and I mean this metaphorically more than
71:20 the eating exercise but you had so much
71:22 good stuff you've been all the rock
71:26 stars you'd ever could imagine you've
71:27 been every movie star and director
71:29 whatever turns you on man WWF wrestlers
71:34 that after a while you keep going up to
71:37 the green room after this life if you
71:38 pop out of the matrix like oh oh it was
71:40 a [ __ ] computer I'll [ __ ] high-five
71:42 well you remember you come back you know
71:44 like oh yeah I forgot I play this game
71:47 and you're like okay just like in New
71:51 York just any video game you might have
71:52 you put it on level 9
71:54 you're on level 2 before let's try it
71:56 what hot and spicy feels like great BAM
71:59 and you come as some poor kid
72:03 bad parents maybe you just die when
72:07 you're born maybe a little a little
72:09 while then you die if it's a painful
72:11 death once maybe it's not you don't
72:14 worry about it because it's you it's you
72:18 determining everything I'm diving into
72:21 the fabric of the matrix so that we can
72:23 have a little bit of a backbone to
72:24 consider this upper echelon concept of
72:26 the socialized experiment being
72:29 monitored for an output value next minus
72:33 one for those of you who have never
72:36 heard an X minus one episode I think
72:39 you're in for a massive treat it was a
72:43 radio program here in the United States
72:45 based on it was supplied by a bunch of
72:48 sci-fi writers that were being published
72:51 at the time in little tiny sci-fi books
72:52 every week and so someone started saying
72:55 man these would be great radio plays and
72:57 so they took it in the predecessor was
72:59 2000 plus but Rod Serling I finally
73:02 found a reference to Rod Serling
73:03 actually said that X minus 1 was one of
73:06 his huge inspirational platforms to make
73:09 the Twilight Zone and he took it out to
73:11 a whole
73:11 level he create the most ultimate twist
73:14 on the end of everything XY as well has
73:16 a lot of twists to a ton of them as a
73:19 matter of fact but there was an episode
73:22 and you can get these it ran from 57 I
73:25 think to 59 or something like that
73:27 there's an episode where they they use
73:31 it's like they're like 22 minute
73:33 episodes the same format of The Twilight
73:35 Zone and you like 25 minutes someone air
73:41 these the first five minutes of the
73:43 episode I don't remember the name as I
73:44 never were any of the names of those
73:45 because I got them in them in mp3 format
73:49 that I think doesn't have the actual
73:52 titles it has the the date in the year
73:54 that it was released as not the title I
73:56 think they actually say it went the
73:58 beginning but anyway use the first five
74:00 minutes to set up this world
74:04 it's an offworld planet how ironic and
74:10 they set up this government you learn
74:12 about there's a sheriff there's some
74:14 citizens there's a city council and they
74:17 have a little meeting and everyone's
74:19 really nice and fun but during this
74:22 announcement at the beginning of the
74:23 episode they say we are going to be
74:24 visited by people from Earth from the
74:27 home colony so we need to do this this
74:29 the sentence you know get it already
74:31 we need a celebration when they get here
74:33 and it's pretty standard format and then
74:37 he the sheriff guard this kind of like
74:39 mayor dude or whatever says to one of
74:41 his buddies what can you talk to you
74:43 after meeting it's like okay meetings
74:45 over
74:46 he brings his buddy back stage news like
74:48 okay because the earth people are coming
74:53 we want to look as sophisticated as they
74:56 are okay what's that mean he says well I
75:00 need you to be a criminal okay what's
75:04 that this is worth has criminals and
75:07 Earth is the most civilized
75:09 you know cornerstone of the galaxy that
75:11 we live in based on humans and so we
75:15 want to look as sophisticated as them
75:16 they have crime and they have criminals
75:17 and I'm a cop as well as the mayor I
75:20 think he was two things and he says I
75:21 need to break I need to bust you as the
75:25 as a criminal when they get here so I
75:27 can show them that we have crime and we
75:30 fight crime really well
75:31 it's okay well what do I have to do he
75:34 says we need to I think you should kill
75:36 somebody he's like what we don't kill
75:41 people in this place no one ever kills
75:42 anybody here I know I know but we have
75:45 to look sophisticated
75:46 it's a funny episode where this dude is
75:49 like struggling with the notion of
75:51 killing someone he doesn't want to do it
75:53 he doesn't have the moral fortitude to
75:56 do it he does not end up doing it in the
75:58 end it's just funny it's a comedy of
76:00 course it doesn't kill anybody but the
76:02 resolve is really funny and how they
76:04 talk it out but I thought that episode
76:08 first I don't know who wrote that
76:11 think about how 90-degree angle that
76:16 story is someone thinking completely
76:19 different than we think they really
76:23 thought a bit like the matrix
76:25 programmers in my opinion to write that
76:27 story now I'm gonna throw one other
76:30 thing at you which is a little more
76:32 esoteric but it's something I've
76:33 definitely personally experienced and I
76:35 would be interested if you have
76:36 experiences personally or if you know of
76:38 stories cuz I have an experience that's
76:40 necessarily personally not yet anyway
76:44 but I have had friends of mine tell me
76:47 stories about them in the 60s and 70s
76:50 especially as they dropped a lot of LSD
76:53 going on these spiritual adventures to
76:57 try and figure out life someone went to
77:01 Buddhist temples and hung out some of
77:04 them just meditated in forests or in
77:08 Hawaii or something like that everyone's
77:10 stories different but they went and get
77:13 like one of my friends is actually a
77:16 friend of a friend that I never actually
77:18 met one of the more poignant stories I
77:21 can remember this guy was the best
77:24 friend of one of my best friends he said
77:26 my buddy went out and just left society
77:29 and went out into the woods and built a
77:31 log cabin and just hunted the wild and
77:35 he wanted to know if he could do it
77:36 because he heard about the cow
77:38 boys doing it back in the days and 1800s
77:40 so you want to know how much of a man he
77:42 was any microdose LSD every single day
77:46 while he was doing this a little bit of
77:48 Walter Bishop action but they invariably
77:52 if you hear that story beginning they
77:55 get really sort of discombobulated and
78:00 more antsy than ever and this is where
78:03 you hear a lot of the philosophers from
78:05 the Greek days say the more I learned
78:07 about everything the more I realized I
78:10 knew nothing think about that think
78:14 about what I'm asserting here a
78:17 threshold of intelligence that turns you
78:20 into basically it doesn't look like
78:22 anything to me the more you ascend in
78:25 your intelligence the more you reach
78:28 this plateau or you like you know what
78:31 you feel as if man hasn't figured out
78:34 anything you know like I went into
78:36 cosmology huge in my teens and I mean
78:40 college level books devouring them
78:44 encyclopedias magazine everything get my
78:47 hands on talking to people and you
78:51 realize physics breaks down at so many
78:54 levels it's ridiculous quasars that are
78:57 supposedly on the edge of the I know if
78:59 it's a galaxy the universe as far as we
79:01 can look out there and they're flying
79:02 away from us suppose they're redshift
79:04 indicates they're flying away from us at
79:06 two times the speed of light why does it
79:09 make any sense with the Einstein
79:11 [ __ ] but if you're an ether person
79:12 works just great I don't know exactly if
79:17 we all reach that epiphany of feeling
79:21 like you know nothing and whether or not
79:24 the data that comes through our brain at
79:26 the exact same time because I'm sure
79:27 that almost none of us could articulate
79:29 why we come to that conclusion sometimes
79:31 but what if that feeling and that
79:34 organization of thought in the mind your
79:37 consciousness which is the combination
79:38 of your brain and your soul and your
79:40 body working together to create this
79:42 instance of your of your consciousness
79:46 maybe we're all having that comedic
79:49 moment in our mind where it just all
79:51 doesn't make sense
79:53 and we don't know how to react to it and
79:57 so we lose track of it and we go oh my
80:02 god I had everything in my mind
80:03 yesterday maybe even this morning but
80:05 the more I researched the more it just
80:08 seems to become vacuous vaporous
80:11 diffuses in my own mind such that the
80:14 facts that I had in my head are gone
80:19 have you ever had a situation where you
80:22 were thinking about a problem some
80:25 people have this when they're high you
80:27 definitely have this when you take LSD
80:28 and a bunch of stuff makes sense and
80:31 then as soon as you come down out of
80:33 that State of Mind whatever's caused it
80:35 could just be you're in the shower
80:36 you're driving your car everything made
80:39 sense for one split second and then the
80:43 next second you can't remember a single
80:44 thing you were thinking of this is some
80:48 outside influence way beyond a banker
80:50 way beyond some science Neil deGrasse
80:54 Tyson with the capital s and quotes told
80:57 you not to believe you just did it to
80:59 yourself when the deep thoughts universe
81:03 especially our fictitious College maybe
81:08 that's proof of this theory I forgot the
81:12 names of the equations but there are a
81:15 handful of equations almost verbatim
81:18 Hannah it literally a handful of
81:20 equation three or four that man there on
81:25 the internet every once in a while where
81:27 these universities in fact there's a
81:29 couple famous ones I looked it up I just
81:31 had the Epiphany just now to mention
81:32 this but there are equations that we we
81:35 look at the equation we know there's a
81:38 solution because all equations have
81:39 solutions it's just a mathematical
81:41 certainty but no one can solve the
81:43 equation the whole world is invited to
81:46 solve the equation and no one can do it
81:49 seems like that would be impossible
81:50 wouldn't it but what if the you know
81:54 they say they teach algebra they teach
81:56 you how to think and that's really the
81:57 truth simplification of algebraic
81:59 equations definitely helps you think but
82:02 what if this particular these particular
82:04 equations that are out there
82:06 if solved would so upgrade the mind of a
82:11 man that it frees the mind upward to be
82:15 able to get to the next concept at half
82:18 the difficulty half the calorie cost and
82:21 thus we reel down from the top of this
82:24 firmament dome or this matrix dropping
82:28 green numbers that fall across the
82:30 screen control and once we can yank down
82:34 the fabric of this existence we can walk
82:37 right off the page of that book and so
82:40 man can't solve the equation now the
82:45 truth that matters so some of those gets
82:46 solved and the beautiful beautiful thing
82:49 about it if you listen to so all my
82:51 episodes the poetic nature of some of
82:53 these equations they get solved by young
82:56 kids who aren't even teenagers yet you
82:59 simply just went oh well yeah boom
83:00 because they're not indoctrinated thus
83:04 they don't have their mind shut down so
83:06 that everything's open everything's
83:08 possible and so all the rules that keep
83:10 grownups from solving the equation don't
83:12 exist you know what I mean right
83:14 Tesla I believe this could probably
83:19 never be proven I believe one of the
83:22 reasons why he was so unbelievably
83:24 successful was that he was quarantined
83:28 from all of the naysayers and because he
83:33 was you know he suffered an illness and
83:35 I forgot exactly what illness it was
83:36 when he was a child he almost died and
83:38 he sort of alluded to the fact that his
83:41 brother was the real smart one and he
83:43 was the troubled kid but after this
83:45 illness it was sort of like those sci-fi
83:49 stories were someone gets hit on the
83:51 head and they become really intelligent
83:53 he seemed to gain the almost adderall
83:57 focus that is necessary to get to these
84:02 next levels and so he was able to go
84:06 really far for a really long time but
84:09 then the mystery of how did a guy with
84:12 that much intelligence end up dying in a
84:16 hotel in New York by himself
84:19 you know I technically think he what I
84:24 read was he hit by a car and then the
84:26 complications of that injury eventually
84:28 took his life but maybe he didn't end up
84:29 getting back to his hotel after the
84:31 hospital visit but you know the guy who
84:36 build Coral Castle I never see this
84:39 guy's name because I can never say it
84:40 right
84:41 very similar dude he had conquered
84:44 probably ether said he figured out how
84:47 the pyramids were built left all these
84:49 crazy equations in his structure and
84:53 it's funny cuz I've had people say oh I
84:55 went there and it's not that impressive
84:57 okay well then how come we can't build
85:00 it you know I went to the pyramids it
85:02 wasn't that impressive there's a rock
85:04 stacked up in a big 450 foot pyramid I
85:07 mean just rocks mm-hmm so it was good to
85:13 revisit the fact that man can't do it
85:15 today but no not even a theory of how to
85:18 do it today I mean they got shitty
85:20 theories that don't mathematically makes
85:22 sense in the end you know like the ramp
85:25 theory that's a good one the ramp takes
85:28 more soil or stones than any of the
85:34 pyramids used to create themselves so
85:37 we'd have a pile of rocks somewhere
85:39 bigger than all three pyramids combined
85:42 just to create the ramp so let's say
85:45 that out of some stroke of luck we were
85:49 able to assemble a paper of all these
85:54 little factoids make the associations in
85:59 a way that seems extremely undeniable we
86:04 prove this theory we don't understand
86:06 why it's happening I mean we do
86:08 understand why it's happening in terms
86:10 of breaking through this barrier of
86:12 being controlled but we don't know
86:16 exactly you know why would you do that
86:17 to us why not let us find you and let
86:19 that be the end of the mousetrap you
86:20 know and then man teaches it we're in
86:26 this euphoric world we get rid of all
86:27 these folks that control the world all
86:30 the NPC's are put down or just people
86:33 that
86:34 evil and we have a euphoric moment and
86:37 we teach children as soon as they wake
86:38 up okay this is what we have to teach
86:42 you and this is the healthy content to
86:46 learn we would have to say and the thing
86:49 is is capitulating down to control
86:51 almost infuriates man doesn't make me
86:53 that happy if this were to be true it's
86:56 almost like I have to intellectually say
86:58 if I thought this were true completely I
87:00 would say there must be a really good
87:02 reason for it it's like the episode of
87:06 Star Trek where they come up on a planet
87:09 they look at it then all of a sudden
87:12 they wake up and they're all their
87:15 memory of the event has been wiped and
87:19 data has been tasked with making sure
87:23 they never remember where they were
87:24 because the society on the planet
87:26 doesn't want them to know anyone they
87:28 don't want anyone from the outside to
87:30 ever find them and so they've created
87:31 this little apparition in space so you
87:34 don't find it but the enterprise pushed
87:35 through it found them and then they all
87:39 work together to make sure that they
87:41 never remember it it's very interesting
87:43 thing but you couldn't tell kids for
87:45 instance well this is the way it works
87:47 and if you think too much you're going
87:48 to get to this point and your brains
87:50 gonna be shut down because all that's
87:52 gonna do is create kids that want to do
87:53 it you know you can't smoke cigarettes
87:56 oh okay well then that's the first thing
87:58 you're gonna do but I think for those of
88:00 us that are awake meaning we have we
88:05 have shunned all of the mind-control
88:10 indoctrination right sciences
88:12 mind-control sciences oh I should say
88:15 official science it's there to teach us
88:18 to close our minds and be happy about it
88:20 because we have it all figured out Big
88:23 Bang is how the universe was created
88:24 regardless of physics breaks down before
88:27 the actual bang happens we're godless if
88:29 we can't find the real mass that would
88:31 make it actually occur like that
88:32 regardless of the fact that gravity is a
88:34 push and not a pole be satisfied
88:38 yes Shakespeare would say it's a hard
88:41 one to deal with if that were the case
88:45 one thing just as I have about another
88:47 inch on this stick here one thing that
88:49 always is a well always romanticizes my
88:54 mind about these ideas of a matrix or a
89:00 dome a biblical dome over the planet is
89:06 the notion that perhaps you know for
89:10 those of you that believe that Colonel
89:11 Byrd says name her Admiral Byrd or
89:14 whatever his name was the guy that went
89:15 to the Antarctica roamed around for 20
89:17 years and said all kinds of wild things
89:19 about the place that don't jive with
89:22 what we know today we're allowed to know
89:24 today
89:25 then the 54 treaty assigned to make sure
89:29 no one's allowed down there without
89:30 permission you know it's like it's all
89:32 cordoned off for ridiculous reasons like
89:34 what do you care if I could go down
89:35 there and get frozen I the the the
89:40 asinine assertion of the 54 treaty not
89:44 to go to the Antarctic guild without
89:46 permission is that you can go to Mount
89:49 Everest and die no problem they don't
89:53 give a [ __ ] go up and die you know but
89:57 you can't go down to the Antarctica die
90:00 that doesn't make any sense does it but
90:04 let me ask you this question if you can
90:06 answer this in the comments I'm not
90:08 trying to milk you for comments over
90:09 just so you know I just love hearing
90:11 your opinions it's what I get out of
90:14 this but could you would we'll put this
90:18 way could you accept the fact that the
90:22 owners of wherever we are would imbue
90:26 the truth to a few human beings and not
90:31 all of us and then imbue those that are
90:35 given that coveted knowledge with the
90:39 power to be as wealthy and as powerful
90:43 as they need to be to ensure that they
90:47 can control us not to go down there or
90:51 whatever it takes not to find it the
90:53 matrix is more interesting to me than
90:55 the dome theory because the matrix
90:57 happens right where I'm sitting I don't
91:00 need to go to Antarctica to unravel the
91:01 matrix but for the Flat Earth don't
91:04 thing you have to go to the edge and
91:06 then you have to mess around but the
91:08 matrix is just discipline my opinion but
91:11 what if that's the game and the equation
91:14 goes and I've said it once before just
91:16 not ten times before what if their deal
91:21 with those that are serendipitously
91:24 bless with this information or entrusted
91:28 with this information is the following
91:32 well if you allow your race your
91:37 instance of us even say they're humans
91:40 on the other side if you allow the
91:43 experiment to go bad then that's exactly
91:47 what's going to happen it's gonna go bad
91:50 and you know I don't necessarily believe
91:53 in Noah's Ark whatsoever okay but I
91:56 thought about this the other day and I
91:59 thought what if they needed to reset
92:03 this cultural petri dish that has this
92:08 inside whatever it is would you unleash
92:12 a virus to kill everyone everyone's like
92:17 you know h1n1 we're all bleeding from
92:21 the inside out because we've dissolved
92:22 from the inside out we're all suffering
92:23 this horrific death bleeding out of our
92:25 eyes and our ears hmm or their option is
92:30 we're just gonna cover all the
92:32 continents with more rain than you've
92:34 ever seen in your life forty days and
92:38 forty nights should do the trick but
92:40 perhaps those are just biblical
92:42 analogies but it's gonna rain and we're
92:46 gonna well even melt the ice caps just
92:48 to make sure everything floods
92:50 that's why Kansas has seashells in it
92:53 and then we'll dry it all out will
92:56 freeze it all up again and then we'll
92:59 see you know we we take a few you out
93:01 you know get a little Adam and Eve
93:04 care package you know like you probably
93:05 want at least a hundred couples
93:06 otherwise you're gonna get a bunch of
93:07 like three I kids and we'll just restart
93:11 this thing in fact we've been rethinking
93:14 Egypt I'm able to just make Egypt begin
93:18 you know but the interesting thing about
93:20 floods is that well back in the
93:23 prehistoric they're actually the
93:25 students a pre story back in the days of
93:27 say Egypt where that's really the only
93:29 game in town with big structures you
93:34 have not much would survive everything
93:36 is pretty natural there's not a lot of
93:37 huts and buildings that would just wash
93:40 away I mean look at the tsunami the hit
93:42 Tok well sorry hit Japan I mean it would
93:46 have ever thought that there's a 30-foot
93:48 tidal wave coming in and just literally
93:51 strips the land of any sense of humanity
93:54 ever being there besides perhaps a
93:55 cement foundation but if those cement
93:58 foundations don't exist well and maybe
94:00 you have a stone road maybe you put
94:03 enough pressure on there it's gonna
94:04 happen I know that you guys talk about
94:07 the mud floods every once in a while the
94:09 mud flood theory I would say I've talked
94:15 about this a couple times wants to jump
94:17 into it because they gave us an inch
94:18 left here the mud flood thing doesn't
94:21 work for me
94:22 based on at least the theories that have
94:26 been presented on YouTube and I watched
94:28 probably four hours of this stuff when
94:31 it first really was hot just disappeared
94:33 as quickly as it landed because I don't
94:35 think anyone else believes it it either
94:36 but some of you are still curious about
94:38 it but they'll show like these towns
94:41 that are erected next to like specially
94:45 mining towns and stuff there's plenty of
94:49 villages and towns in history whether
94:52 they were simply by mountains with love
94:54 with very little vegetation or the pitch
94:57 on the mountain meaning its vertical
94:59 slope was really intense and hey man if
95:01 it rains a lot on those mountains or
95:03 Hills or whatever you just the hill is
95:05 even more dangerous than a mountain I
95:06 just watched this video where Israel had
95:09 a major flash flood those phenomenal day
95:13 time shot it's like this dry deserts
95:15 beautiful desert rock and all of a
95:17 sudden
95:18 you could hear it it was coming and you
95:20 saw just this mist coming and it just
95:23 was it was it just amazing River just
95:26 immediately happened out of nothing it
95:29 was super deep - it happens every year
95:31 it's all been carved out and stuff if
95:34 you built a mining colony on the side of
95:36 a hill and you had a house up right and
95:39 you could get to all sides of the house
95:40 from the foundation up and you stay
95:43 there 50 years yeah you're gonna get
95:45 mega tons of dirt and soil coming down
95:49 the mountain every time it rains every
95:50 time the monsoon it's ever been to
95:52 Havasu in Nevada man you'll be out there
95:57 I was out there with my buddy Bobby lot
96:00 sir and we're on his boat it was dog and
96:02 just he and I out there and where it
96:04 says sunniest could be it's higher than
96:07 14 degrees imma trying to get to the
96:11 turtle bar on the north side of the
96:13 river and we're hauling but all of us
96:16 fast as we can take our shoot our little
96:17 boat and he looks over and it's he's
96:20 looking wet our East excuse me he's
96:23 looking east and he sees a popcorn
96:24 clouds coming over the hill but you know
96:27 storm is supposed to go west to east
96:29 right he's like oh oh I'm looking over
96:33 there I'm from Kansas I'm seeing black
96:34 clouds drop you know sheets of rain like
96:36 fricking Stargate portal you know where
96:40 it's not reading on this side and then
96:42 two feet in front of you it's like a
96:43 mirror and so I'm looking over there
96:45 he's like oh we better turn around and
96:48 we're like halfway there almost 60% that
96:50 we there I said what that
96:53 it's like 140 now it's like all blue
96:56 skies over our hand what he talked her
96:57 like no clouds
96:58 there's no that's coming that's a
97:00 monsoon man and so I'm kind of arguing
97:05 with him a little bit we turn the boat
97:06 around I'll show you guys a picture I
97:07 took at the dog Jack the river baby god
97:11 bless his soul
97:12 he's our guard on the dog our guard dog
97:15 on the boat he since passed I need to do
97:17 an episode about Jack he was amazing he
97:20 sure enough we flipped this thing around
97:22 we're not even halfway back and the
97:25 clouds are like middle earth man it was
97:28 it was
97:31 spielberg like blue skies seem to just
97:33 create the clouds out of nothing like
97:35 the low pressure system happened fast
97:37 because there's plenty of water coming
97:39 off the lake it must have just made the
97:41 clouds but we get into Havasu proper and
97:45 we're literally just trying to get the
97:47 boat up to the dock tie it on it's
97:50 starting to rain a little bit we help
97:52 inside this this restaurant on the pier
97:56 and man it rained cats and dogs like
98:00 instantaneously so I think about these
98:03 situations where you have these mining
98:05 colonies out exactly in these areas
98:07 these sort of desert communities and
98:11 that can happen so I don't quite
98:14 subscribe to that whole mud flood thing
98:17 yeah there's cities under cities under
98:19 cities I mean it's just part of it had
98:21 to do which is building up I have to do
98:23 with water being channeled in areas that
98:27 didn't didn't exist before was the Grand
98:30 Tour guys just did their first season
98:32 opener and they were in Vietnam and they
98:39 were there the whole challenge is to
98:41 take a bunch of boats from inner Vietnam
98:43 to the edge of Vietnam and leaf and
98:48 there was no water because China built a
98:50 big damn well dams could be built and
98:53 names can be the results of rocks
98:55 falling you know anyway let me know what
98:59 you think in the comments I would be
99:02 interested in any experiences that
99:04 you've had as you become enlightened and
99:07 whether or not it ugh men today life of
99:10 course it augments our souls right
99:11 because the more we integrate algorithms
99:13 of truth to supplant the algorithms of
99:17 lies that we've been told our whole life
99:19 it is a it's a beautiful experience it's
99:22 almost if like the Holy Spirit sort of
99:24 theory of going inside you and you
99:26 feeling better about the world sort of
99:27 thing but let me know if you have other
99:31 examples in history that you can you
99:33 could name they kind of fall along this
99:35 archetype we're not trying to make
99:36 something exist if it's completely wrong
99:40 but I think that there is definitely
99:42 something to it
99:44 and I think it would be again if we were
99:47 charged with making the matrix program
99:49 that is our existence if you watch the
99:51 movie matrix again which I just did
99:52 recently you will have an episode about
99:54 the matrix from 1999 for me which it
99:57 should be a timely thing because the
99:58 matrix force coming out I think this
100:00 year same day John wick force coming out
100:04 wants company a glorious day but I
100:08 really do believe that we would make the
100:11 program like this we wouldn't want our
100:13 subjects to be aware of their
100:16 surroundings and I think that we
100:17 wouldn't do it to spite them I think we
100:19 would do it to protect them and I think
100:25 that if we were on the outside looking
100:26 at the coders looking at the game
100:29 designers or whatever and they're just
100:30 looking back over their shoulder at you
100:32 you're going yeah you know like we're
100:34 gonna do like this right cuz here's a
100:37 fuel here's a few experiences that
100:38 happen they roll back video of even
100:41 earth before maybe we've done this once
100:44 before there was a flood they got us all
100:46 reset and they're like look how unhappy
100:47 everybody is so anyway if you have them
100:51 into deep thoughts radio calm please go
100:53 it's ready for you first and foremost is
100:57 a search engine so if you're bored one
100:58 day just type a word in the interest to
101:00 you and find out if there's an episode
101:01 about it second thing you can do is go
101:04 to the category lists if you you're in
101:05 your mobile device could scroll down
101:07 below if you're on the websites on the
101:08 right on your computer and it just has
101:11 the categories if you come through
101:13 YouTube players on your TV you can
101:17 usually search DTR and then the word
101:19 you're interested in you'll find the
101:21 episode although they do gank us out of
101:23 the search so it's kind of a bummer but
101:26 we have two video feeds ones YouTube
101:29 ones bit shoot please get to cow bit
101:32 shoot because they need our support it's
101:34 the First Amendment protected video
101:35 alternative to YouTube unfortunately
101:40 don't have an app for the TV but if
101:42 YouTube got really drew Kony in which
101:44 they haven't they would definitely make
101:46 that app and get it out there plenty of
101:50 links for podcasts social media is a
101:52 lock Facebook group of some of the
101:53 greatest people in planet Earth we are
101:55 starting to get some new members so
101:56 welcome
101:57 bored everyone we have Twitter which is
101:59 taking off as well and they contributing
102:01 to the shows overall subscription hike
102:03 in the last week I've had 20 new
102:06 subscriptions so that's like a
102:07 record-breaking thing for the latter
102:11 seasons of the show
102:12 in spite of shadow Benny then we have
102:15 mine's calm which is the Facebook
102:17 competitor
102:18 it's a beautiful website there's a link
102:20 up there you have to sign in to get in
102:21 to see anything that's just like
102:23 Facebook you can't see inside until you
102:25 create an account
102:25 probably another great place just to
102:27 create an account regardless if you
102:29 subscribe to me you have a couple of
102:31 ways to donate to the page there's
102:33 PayPal and patreon remember patriotic
102:37 users get 95 percent of the shows before
102:40 everybody else and you get 20 percent
102:43 discount on the store which is cool
102:45 there's two products that I put in the
102:46 donate section I don't make any money
102:48 off of it but it's the brave browser
102:50 which is a new web browser you need to
102:52 get it's faster than all the other ones
102:53 it cuts off all the trackers no one can
102:56 see what you're doing change the search
102:57 engine from Google the duck duck go it
103:00 doesn't track what you do so you really
103:01 just poke the deep state state I out
103:03 it's awesome it's based on a chromium
103:07 kernel which is I do not believe it has
103:09 anything to do with Chrome if you want
103:12 put VPN underneath of that I think you'd
103:14 be pretty damn secure from at least
103:15 everyone but the government there is a
103:18 store I have two shirts for this season
103:20 they will be pulled down as soon as the
103:22 season is over I will make more shirts
103:24 for those of you that got the season 3
103:26 shirt you are now gonna be the ones that
103:28 have that shirt and no one else will
103:30 have them so we're gonna make that a bit
103:32 of an exclusivity you will not find any
103:35 season 1 episodes on this channel
103:37 because they created them using a bunch
103:38 of my proprietary music and thus they
103:40 were banned around the world but they
103:43 were also just banned so there's a whole
103:45 new channel up there all remastered just
103:47 get up there and subscribe start tuning
103:49 them up if we can create an amazing
103:51 moment month position can be turned on
103:54 but you have to do like a billion views
103:56 in no time flat you have to have a
103:58 thousand subscribers so that was like it
103:59 will never occur unless the show somehow
104:02 gets advertised by someone the
104:03 mainstream for those the pass around the
104:07 show thank you so much because I know
104:09 that a few of you
104:11 I have come on and you will say oh my
104:14 gosh I just found this channel it's my
104:16 favorite podcast on YouTube now and
104:19 coincidentally I'll get 10 20 new
104:21 subscribers and I I have this suspicion
104:24 it's the person that says that that
104:26 actually passes it around and gives that
104:28 opinion and then gets it up there so you
104:31 know there are benefits to us the more
104:34 that we can get this thing up because
104:36 this channel is monetized you know the
104:38 monetization is about getting to a point
104:41 I can do this full time or a hell of a
104:43 lot more than I do we're gonna need a
104:45 hundred times the subscribers that we
104:47 have today to get that to work but you
104:50 know I see unless your channels do
104:51 better way better than us so we're very
104:54 cerebral we don't have a lot of flash if
104:56 this is your first time to the channel
104:58 and you're still listening thank you
104:59 very much but you need to know it's a
105:01 variety Channel
105:02 don't get all bummed out if the next
105:03 episode is not what you want
105:05 there's 475 to 500 episodes you can go
105:08 back and look at again just search on a
105:10 keyword I have gotten a question I want
105:13 to answer a few times and the bumpers
105:14 which is people asking me why can't I
105:16 see season one in my podcast feed and
105:20 that's a limitation of your podcast
105:22 software which limits it to 300 entries
105:26 usually so sometimes you can go in and
105:28 change the settings and say just give it
105:30 all to me and then you'll see it but if
105:32 you really want to just speed up the
105:34 process go up to the website on your
105:36 phone search on the subject you want to
105:40 get into and then there's the mp3 right
105:42 down there with the download button so
105:45 you can download to your phone and
105:46 listen to it at your heart's content so
105:49 anyway for coming to the show thank you
105:51 so much for all of you have hung on all
105:53 my patreon people love you so much
105:55 you're in the credits again if you ever
105:57 contribute anything monetarily through
105:59 patreon I will put you in the credits
106:02 forever paypal conceals who you are so I
106:05 haven't been able to put anyone's name
106:07 in there so if you did contribute and
106:09 you're like damn and I want my name in
106:10 the credits just point me at your
106:12 transaction and kaboom you're in the
106:13 credits for the rest of your life
106:14 whether you ever give another dollar
106:16 you're in so let's make that bumper like
106:18 10 minutes long okay at the very end but
106:22 anyway

106:25 and I will see you in the next deep
