00:00 [Music]
00:33 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:34 deep thoughts today we're going to take
00:38 another swipe at NASA in any related
00:41 parties to engage in this this is called
00:44 NASA selling doomsday and it's not going
00:48 to completely be about just that because
00:53 it's not enough to fill up an hour so
00:54 we're going to recap sort of where the
00:57 internet is with NASA JPL and subsidiary
01:02 organizations and sort of where the the
01:06 strategies are going with that
01:08 organization as just interpreted by the
01:10 layman on the outside looking in there's
01:13 been this theme my whole life and it's
01:15 been your whole life as well and it
01:19 doesn't just focus on NASA but this is
01:22 the most alluring easy blatant way to
01:25 explain it but anywhere there is an
01:29 anywhere there's a mystery in life you
01:33 have devious [ __ ] that seem to get
01:36 in there first and they extort things
01:41 from society due to the fact that we are
01:44 still ignorant of what they're talking
01:46 about they labor to create some sort of
01:50 conspiracy or cautionary tale they labor
01:57 to come up with a cause-and-effect model
01:59 to say we have found this really bad
02:02 thing in the universe and we figured out
02:04 how to keep it at bay and if you give us
02:06 money and whatever your daughter's will
02:09 will keep it back
02:12 right there were a bunch of individuals
02:14 that figured out how how and when
02:17 eclipses occurred and they would go
02:22 around Europe and the world and they
02:24 would somehow get themselves you know
02:26 they were fairly well traveled you know
02:28 they looked good or whatever they're
02:30 able to talk to the authorities until
02:33 the authorities to inform the king that
02:37 there's going to be blackness and
02:40 darkness and doom and gloom if they're
02:44 not paid to do a ritual to undo this
02:48 moment and so Kings sometimes would tell
02:52 them to go [ __ ] themselves I'm sure some
02:55 just did it and said you know we've seen
02:57 an eclipse dude you know spare me your
02:59 horseshit but it is said that several
03:03 kings and diplomats caved in the second
03:06 that the eclipse was starting to occur
03:10 this individual starts doing this ritual
03:12 and saying how bad everything's going to
03:13 be and then of course they throw down a
03:15 bunch of money and resources and voila
03:17 the Eclipse is over thank God we had
03:21 that snake oil salesman right so this
03:25 kind of [ __ ] has been going on for ever
03:28 right we now have this so convoluted and
03:33 this is actually an ancient formula but
03:36 the second that a government wants to
03:37 conspire against its people and there's
03:41 no other format that leads into this as
03:43 soon as they want to conspire against
03:46 their people not for their people in
03:48 private but against right individuals
03:51 are using the Boheme lithography of a
03:53 government of a government body to steal
03:57 from the people to rob them of their
04:00 rights to put them in sort of some
04:02 serfdom tyranny they begin to develop
04:06 this narrative that says I can't tell
04:11 you what I'm doing or what we're doing
04:13 because it's a matter of national
04:14 security
04:17 you want to know how the
04:18 military-industrial complex came to be
04:22 because before we had volunteer armies
04:25 right it was pretty you know open book
04:29 transparent organization you could walk
04:32 right into the White House when Lincoln
04:34 was president and just call out his name
04:37 and get to the Oval Office and sit down
04:39 and have the meeting you could and now
04:43 obviously you can't because the plans
04:45 that are hatched inside those buildings
04:47 are rarely for the people rarely despite
04:52 what recently elected politicians might
04:55 want you to believe well mystery has to
04:57 do with how things are discovered where
05:00 they are etc etcetera give you a more
05:03 esoteric example that some of you
05:05 remember quite well apparently
05:08 Huntington Beach is the funnest goddamn
05:10 place on planet earth to fly your
05:11 private vehicle over but some of you
05:16 remember when you remember reading about
05:18 this you don't remember this actually
05:19 happening but when the King Tut's tomb
05:21 was discovered you have an archaeologist
05:26 who spent at an ordinate of time digging
05:29 for his tomb and what happened was is
05:31 that the guy had to pick an arbitrary
05:33 point in the Valley of the Kings to
05:34 search for the tomb it was rumored to be
05:37 in the area he dug in a circle well he
05:41 took a point on a circle I want you to
05:44 go write about you know 40 degrees stop
05:50 go back to your starting point and go
05:52 all the way around and what he found out
05:55 was that right where he stopped on his
05:57 first dig as he was going in this circle
06:00 he was right next to the tomb but I
06:03 think he spent some godly amount of
06:05 years going the opposite direction and
06:07 he finally found it so now you have this
06:11 tomb of the most celebrated Pharaoh that
06:14 we know of King Tut was a African black
06:19 male as all the Egyptians at the time
06:22 were there his glorious era his tomb was
06:27 embroidered with things that even
06:29 Rameses missed right on a NACA on Anakin
06:34 whatever his father's name was wasn't
06:37 given this much celebration
06:40 and so the archaeologist is surrounded
06:43 by obviously locals that believe in a
06:45 lot of superstitious stuff but it was
06:48 hatched that if you touch that - then
06:52 you're gonna die there's this energy to
06:54 die obviously everyone's going to die
06:56 and so of course when the tale started
06:58 coming out you know God 60 years later
07:02 or 40 years later you know it's been so
07:06 many years that people in their twenties
07:08 were just dying because that's because I
07:09 got old they smoked cigarettes or
07:11 whatever but they tried to build a
07:13 conspiracy and if you go in there and
07:17 touch that you're gonna die and what
07:22 does that do that keeps people out right
07:25 so going different polarities right you
07:28 can keep you inside something and keep
07:30 you outside of something Close
07:33 Encounters of the Third Kind the movie
07:36 Richard Dreyfuss directed by Steven
07:38 Spielberg written primarily by Steven
07:43 there is this transmission coming in
07:46 from outer space it's giving
07:47 geographical coordinates and they figure
07:52 out the devil's mountain is this place
07:55 where the aliens want to show up and say
07:57 hello and so what does the government do
07:59 they fake a chemical spill they use this
08:07 Birdcage technique everyone's wearing
08:09 gas masks trying to escape on trains
08:12 it's very al Schmidt see full evacuation
08:15 if you bring your bird to the site they
08:19 take it away gas it kill it bring it
08:24 back to you and say yeah oh my gosh you
08:25 know good thinking at your mask on
08:28 Richard Dreyfuss is character you know
08:31 sniff sniff through the [ __ ] took
08:33 his mask off took a deep breath and
08:34 realize it was all horseshit and he a
08:37 scientist and this woman whose child had
08:40 been abducted they come up the backside
08:43 of Devil's mountain crawl around the
08:45 front side and they get to see the
08:46 firework show with the UFO and all the
08:50 aliens
08:52 so NASA NASA is an organization that is
08:57 given the idea and the feeling that it's
09:01 an international organization which it
09:02 obviously has its fingers and everything
09:05 on planet Earth related to space travel
09:10 somehow an arbitrary group of people by
09:13 the way have claimed space right we're
09:17 not allowed to send things up too high
09:18 because we're just mere [ __ ] peasants
09:21 on this planet right and there there's
09:23 some [ __ ] Anunnaki people that have
09:25 the jurisdiction over space I think
09:31 right there
09:32 you know we should all take a little
09:33 step back and go yeah I don't I don't
09:36 think I'm going to allow you to have
09:38 jurisdiction over the planet when you're
09:40 just a [ __ ] human being and so am i
09:42 right
09:43 doesn't mean you can't have
09:45 organizations that coordinate launches
09:47 and that kind of thing to make sure we
09:48 don't have you know someone launches a
09:50 rocket in Utah and flies into the bottom
09:52 of some 737 headed to Washington State
09:56 or something but NASA is a
09:58 self-appointed organization by you know
10:00 mainly funded by the United States of
10:02 America that has taken on supposedly the
10:07 Charter to explore space well space
10:10 travels and no matter how you do at low
10:12 atmospheric launches which seems to be
10:15 all they're capable of doing it's
10:17 expensive because you have to hire very
10:20 smart people you have a tremendous
10:24 amount of mistakes that occur you just
10:27 do and so you build big giant
10:30 multi-million dollar rockets or 100
10:32 million dollar rockets and they blow up
10:34 on the tarmac well back to the drawing
10:36 board luckily today we're getting more
10:41 and more software developed that allows
10:44 us to test this stuff inside a simulator
10:46 instead of building it and then watching
10:49 it explode but it cost a lot of money
10:52 and as many people have figured out
10:54 NASA's real objective was to put a
10:56 veneer a cover over the development of
11:02 intercontinental ballistic missiles
11:04 tomahawks
11:05 everything rocketry based in military
11:08 and the the two-stage rocket to quote a
11:12 metaphor for military domination in the
11:15 world is to sell military domination to
11:18 the people in the notion that they're
11:20 going to be killing their enemy to drum
11:23 up a bunch of Kim Jong Un's and a bunch
11:25 of you know terrorists terrorist
11:28 organizations to demonize Assad use
11:32 these missiles on those individuals keep
11:34 the technology coming right keep the
11:36 tardy coming until eventually the whole
11:41 apparatus flips around and police's the
11:44 people the people who are good-natured
11:48 couldn't imagine anyone doing this to
11:50 them will find themselves in a
11:52 tyrannical fascist world they will find
11:55 themselves heavily depopulated would be
11:59 the fabled Holocaust times 100 million
12:03 right cuz they'll be getting rid of
12:05 billions of people and so they have to
12:08 keep this this motor going because NASA
12:11 by itself earns 60 million dollars a day
12:16 to make payroll and pay for all their
12:19 [ __ ] $5,000 toilet seats they
12:23 incorporation with JPL Jack Parsons
12:26 Laboratory they develop software to
12:31 create fake imagery that they sell you
12:35 with a narrative that they've launched a
12:37 rocket to a far-off place and here's all
12:40 the photographic proof aren't you happy
12:42 please keep sending your donations but
12:47 do you personally vote on the funding of
12:50 NASA personally I never have I've never
12:53 heard of anyone doing it it's one of
12:55 these organizations like the FDA the FCC
12:59 the EPA just sort of renegade
13:02 organizations that get appointed by the
13:04 next chili president they can completely
13:07 [ __ ] up and kill every single astronaut
13:09 supposedly and there's no repercussions
13:11 whatsoever no one has to resign hell if
13:15 anyone cares how this [ __ ] Haven happens
13:17 like how bad
13:18 how does it occur and it could have been
13:20 prevented and did you know it was going
13:22 to have a high risk of exploding I don't
13:25 know if you've taken the time out to
13:28 look up the Challenger survivors you
13:32 know there's a pretty compelling
13:34 evidence that everyone on the challenger
13:35 1986 survived survived that crash
13:40 because they weren't in the vehicle to
13:42 begin with we've supposedly found every
13:44 single one of these people they have the
13:46 same [ __ ] names some guys say they're
13:48 twin brothers using the same names it's
13:49 almost like landfill and beer fest so
13:52 [ __ ] hilarious how they do this [ __ ]
13:54 I mean thank God these people didn't die
13:57 but when the space shuttle in 1986 blew
14:01 up richard fineman a famous brooklyn new
14:04 york physicist was put in charge of the
14:06 program to figure out what went wrong
14:08 and he's a genius and he's very he was
14:16 just the most well-balanced physicist
14:18 we've ever had mean this guy but he
14:21 tells the story in his autobiography
14:22 released in 1988 that he said you know I
14:25 couldn't figure out exactly what was
14:27 going on the data suggests that they
14:30 knew that there was a high risk of this
14:33 thing blowing up and I went to have been
14:35 to Edward Tufte school twice I'll share
14:38 our story in a second but he said he was
14:40 eating dinner with the head of NASA and
14:41 the head of NASA brings him out to the
14:43 garage and says you know I was thinking
14:45 about the Space Shuttle than the
14:46 explosion I thought you know we have
14:48 these things called overhangs on the
14:50 booster rockets and I'm a carburetor
14:52 enthusiast and we have all these o-rings
14:54 inside of our carburetors and he goes
14:56 you know when they get cold they break
14:57 and they snap I thought maybe the
14:59 o-rings popped and snapped during launch
15:01 because it was so cold and immediately
15:05 Fineman knew he was had as he says in
15:07 his own book he says these [ __ ]
15:09 strung me along they knew exactly what
15:11 the goddamn problem was they didn't want
15:13 to admit it quickly because it needed to
15:15 remain a mystery to the people it needed
15:17 to remain like oh my gosh golly gee I
15:19 didn't realize the [ __ ] o-rings might
15:21 crack and burst right Edward Tufte The
15:26 Godfather of information design I've had
15:29 the privilege of going to his seminar
15:31 twice
15:32 he tells the story that he was hired by
15:33 now so to go in there and design the
15:37 redesign the data input that all the
15:40 scientists had been telling NASA the day
15:42 before and according to him they had
15:45 anywhere from 12 to 13 hours straight
15:48 meetings the day before that launch
15:50 where all the scientists at NASA were
15:52 saying this thing is going to [ __ ]
15:53 explode if you launch it tomorrow
15:55 because it's the coldest it's ever been
15:57 in Florida and he redesigned the
16:02 information such that they realized that
16:05 the coldest they'd ever launched an
16:07 equal 69 degrees Fahrenheit and they had
16:09 like some you know nearly 30 percent
16:13 failure rate of all these systems on
16:15 that on the vehicle because it was so
16:16 cold and it was sub 40 it was like 39
16:19 degrees that morning we had frost on
16:21 everything it was really super cold but
16:23 the White House supposedly put a massive
16:25 amount of pressure get this thing off
16:27 the ground let's hope that the pictures
16:31 that I've seen if all the astronauts
16:32 aged 30 years is true because it's it's
16:37 the best doppelganger search I've ever
16:39 seen in my life
16:40 but some of these people supposedly met
16:42 these folks and confirmed that they hang
16:44 on there to their false identities and
16:47 good for them right but let's think
16:49 about this doomsday we live okay lives
16:55 right because what could be a doomsday
16:57 situation is typically not in our circle
17:00 of life you don't wake up in the morning
17:03 hop out of bed and deal with a doomsday
17:06 situation even if you're ill an illness
17:10 takes a while to catch up with you right
17:13 nowadays thank God there's 100 ways to
17:15 push that [ __ ] out of your life and
17:16 survive the whole thing and live that
17:18 other whatever number of years you got
17:20 left but where there is a container of
17:24 mystery a container of information
17:25 education that we don't have access to
17:27 on an average basis right you know how
17:31 many of you dabble in astrophysics right
17:34 aerospace it sounds more sophisticated
17:39 and complicated than it really is and
17:41 that's the that is absolutely the truth
17:44 these people get you know like adhere an
17:46 astronaut don't get all swept away by
17:49 the the pedigrees of long technical
17:54 words so it's tough to keep these
17:58 organizations the seem to be wasting
18:01 trillions of dollars every decade it's
18:06 tough to keep them going you have to
18:08 convince the population to give up
18:10 enough money to essentially cure all the
18:14 educational woes we have in this country
18:16 we give those [ __ ] so much
18:18 money that your kid could go to any Ivy
18:20 League school in the world if we were
18:23 just to turn that piece-of-shit
18:24 organization off and give it to the kids
18:27 you want kids to learn science hey how
18:30 about not going with the inspirational
18:32 model to get them into these degrees
18:34 that have no you know validity how about
18:36 taking that money in developing degrees
18:39 and paying the scientists who supposedly
18:42 know all this [ __ ] to teach the kids and
18:44 the kids will run off and create private
18:46 industry to get to the moon to get to
18:48 Mars to travel the universe if that's
18:50 possible
18:50 now doomsday technique is sold
18:53 everywhere right you must do this
18:55 because you must because we have to
18:57 prevent that every single time a
18:59 president talks about expanding the the
19:01 size of a military it always has to be
19:05 on the on the heels of some imminent
19:08 threat to the country the United States
19:11 of America as of may 2017 we are facing
19:16 supposedly the threat of North Korea who
19:18 have never seen a nuke and their [ __ ]
19:21 life but they laughably laughably okay
19:25 claim they've had nuclear weapons and
19:27 everyone around them says they have
19:29 nuclear weapons
19:30 anyone who says North Korea as a nuclear
19:32 weapon is so completely [ __ ] duped
19:35 they can't think for themselves for a
19:37 split second it doesn't mean that some
19:39 terrorist organization won't use some
19:42 nuclear type device or something and
19:45 blame it on them so you can create this
19:47 war I mean Kim Jong Jong if you say in
19:49 what he's saying you know
19:50 someone needs to swat his acid to the
19:52 [ __ ] afterlife but it's always based
19:55 on this right Assad who isn't hurting
19:58 America at all is our second target
20:00 hilarious Russia who absolutely doesn't
20:05 want anything to disrupt their
20:07 reformation of their country there
20:09 they're increasing their population
20:10 Putin is subsidizing child birth they
20:16 don't want anything to do with us in
20:17 terms of war I'd love to be our partners
20:20 and we should do that any [ __ ] who
20:21 says we should be enemies with Russia is
20:23 some [ __ ] Cold War you know fossil
20:27 that's why you can't keep these Nancy
20:29 Pelosi [ __ ] in in office you can't they
20:33 hang on to doctrine from 30 40 [ __ ]
20:36 years ago they think that [ __ ] works on
20:40 us today Maxine Waters my god you're
20:44 talking about her [ __ ] body is an
20:46 archaeological dig in itself right you
20:50 got to clean these old [ __ ] out term
20:52 [ __ ] limits and age limits right you
20:56 can't be a senator after you hit a
20:57 certain age because you're carrying the
20:59 doctrine and the dogma from your [ __ ]
21:02 past into the present and you can only
21:06 do it a couple terms then you're the
21:07 [ __ ] out of there and you don't get life
21:09 time anything maybe a tiny pension you
21:13 don't get [ __ ] health care that's
21:14 better than everyone else's health care
21:16 but which organization in our modern
21:19 world encapsulate them encapsulate sand
21:22 owns technically through mental
21:24 jurisdiction the most mystery in this
21:27 world
21:28 I think it's Nessa I think it's GPL I
21:34 don't know of any organization that says
21:37 you know this is our Charter and this
21:40 this stuff this information is in the
21:41 middle of this charter and we are the
21:44 world authority we are the
21:45 self-appointed world authority how
21:47 convenient to all this information and
21:50 therefore we can take the data and mulch
21:52 it any way we like remember how we
21:54 talked about mathematics in a previous
21:56 episode in season 2 mathematics is the
22:00 way that you can get anything to happen
22:02 any
22:04 again you could take gravity and assign
22:06 it to Angel power and create this
22:09 physical model where you're talking
22:10 about how big the biceps are of angels
22:12 to be able to lift and crush push and
22:14 pull everything and you could make it
22:16 work with what's predictably visible and
22:18 just simply say those angels are
22:20 invisible so what are some of the
22:23 doomsday things that NASA is the
22:24 authority on right well the one that
22:27 I've seen over and over and over which I
22:29 think might come up as a false flag
22:31 eventually is the coronal mass ejection
22:34 a CME this is when the Sun does a very
22:40 natural thing that it has done since the
22:42 beginning of time that it blows out of
22:46 its you know fusion surface of its
22:50 plasma core gigantic arms of you know
22:54 atomic matter that's very very hot
22:57 millions and ten tens of millions of
22:59 degrees which obviously cools down very
23:02 quickly and the theory is is that these
23:05 things escape so far out in space
23:07 because they've blown so far away that
23:10 it hits earth and because it's made of
23:12 you know incredible incredibly dense
23:15 clouds of electrons supposedly the
23:17 shield that has been protecting earth
23:19 forever
23:19 it's natural electromagnetic shield
23:21 based on the plasma core of Earth's same
23:24 as the Sun same as all moons same as all
23:26 planets suddenly fails and this stuff
23:31 kisses the ground and blows out
23:33 satellites in geosynchronous
23:35 toasts you know wiring like back in the
23:38 eighteen hundreds supposedly you know
23:40 you had telegrams that were disturbed by
23:43 this stuff there's a lot of science
23:45 behind that I'll try to get into four
23:47 we're over a couple of things they don't
23:49 tell you to keep this [ __ ] going is
23:52 that 97% of the the energy that leaves
23:55 the Sun gets sucked back into the Sun
23:57 because of its gravitational force you
24:01 can just watch it half the time big arm
24:04 comes out and as long as the cameras not
24:06 zoomed up too much you see the thing
24:08 come right back into the Sun it's just
24:11 the cycle so you got three percent that
24:14 escapes
24:16 maybe on some you know heavy period it
24:20 knocks out 5% right but now let's take
24:24 the odds of that thing hitting planet
24:27 Earth
24:27 alright again we're going to go with
24:30 heliocentric so just stay with Mir it's
24:33 ball is supposedly 93 million miles away
24:36 again as I always say on this show if
24:38 the if a son was a football earth is a
24:42 third of a period on a piece of paper
24:43 just grab any book look at a period and
24:46 then cut that into one third and put it
24:48 36 feet away from the center of this
24:52 basketball okay
24:54 so we're a tiny [ __ ] target if you're
24:58 playing darts you are trying to you know
25:01 throw a needle at a pimple on a [ __ ]
25:04 gnat SAS right so there's something
25:06 called diffusion it's a natural process
25:09 of everything okay
25:12 yes it's slightly different in
25:14 supposedly the vacuum of space but when
25:17 you throw something away from a circular
25:19 object a spherical object you and Nate
25:21 Lee get diffusion by shear vector of all
25:24 the particles and where they go meaning
25:25 everything is going in a slightly
25:26 different direction for any of you who
25:29 have a problem just grasping this just
25:31 think about to two of you you and your
25:34 buddy add a gigantic football field
25:37 one of you is going to walk straight
25:39 towards the endzone the other one your
25:41 buddy's going to be walking right next
25:43 to you but they're one degree off your
25:46 path now for 50 yards you look like
25:49 you're almost walking hand handed hand
25:52 right you could actually grab each
25:54 other's hands but as soon as you cross
25:56 the 50-yard Mike or mark you're going to
25:58 start being so far away from each other
26:00 that you know Bob would be 20 feet away
26:02 from each other by the time you hit the
26:03 end zone together thing is the earth is
26:06 so teeny [ __ ] tiny compared to the
26:09 Sun compared to its distance travel
26:11 compared to the vector of all these
26:12 particles that the amount of that
26:16 thermal energy that ionic wave of
26:20 negatively charged atom or sorry
26:22 particles coming at earth is minimal and
26:26 it always has been and it always will be
26:30 we have never ever been in threat of a
26:34 coronal mass ejection mana has been
26:36 conscious on this planet
26:37 okay recording history for 60,000 years
26:40 at least
26:42 alright and no one has any pictures of
26:45 how the whole [ __ ] world blew up one
26:47 day all right you know I was watching my
26:50 cousin across over there and that cue me
26:52 you came in there and just fried him I
26:53 was ok where I was it's never happened
26:57 now when it comes to all the fabled
26:59 stories of how it has interrupted
27:01 electrical wires and that sort of thing
27:03 you can do yourself a favor don't look
27:06 up all of the anomalies that were
27:09 figured out when they tried to create
27:11 wires for Telegraph's it is an
27:15 unbelievable localized problem and that
27:19 in order to put a electrical charge down
27:22 a wire and send it a really long
27:24 distance and then keep it going keep it
27:27 going reify it it was probably one of
27:31 the biggest challenges to mankind due to
27:33 the way that they were building a wire
27:35 they were insulating the wire when water
27:38 hit the wire the way that the
27:40 electromagnetic field started
27:41 interrupting itself and they started
27:43 turning corners when they started
27:45 hitting their their telephone poles
27:49 their telegraph poles every single thing
27:53 about a wire for our telegram was
27:56 heavily scrutinized him and they went
27:58 through a dozen designs of major major
28:00 differences in how they shielded these
28:02 wires and all this other stuff so the
28:06 wires themselves are fragile II put
28:08 together without any interaction from
28:10 the Sun and we know how corporations
28:14 work they do the bare minimum to get the
28:16 job done if it's vulnerable to the
28:19 slightest outside interference they will
28:21 leave it there and just just say okay
28:23 well this thing only happens every once
28:25 in a while so I guess we're okay someone
28:28 goes that's okay don't to spend any
28:29 money to get the job done right let's go
28:33 but they've been incubating this story
28:35 up and at the same time they've been
28:37 incubating up the idea that terrorist
28:39 organizations can come in and mess with
28:41 all of our power grids and all this
28:43 other stuff
28:44 our transportation grids and that kind
28:46 of thing you know various areas you know
28:49 varying areas of the United States are
28:50 more vulnerable than others they you
28:52 know most of the most of the places are
28:55 fairly well secured they're videotaped
28:58 and watched by guards and they're
28:59 patrolled by human beings when you know
29:02 they can't advance a tech far enough to
29:04 get the stuff really encrypted and
29:06 protected so we've done a pretty good
29:10 job but everything that NASA comes in
29:13 with as a doomsday prediction is always
29:15 something that is belongs to the
29:16 universe and it's somehow abstracted
29:19 away from human beings such that it's
29:20 actually more of a threat inside our
29:23 souls because we are always told by NASA
29:26 we have no control over the doomsday
29:27 that they predict right someone could
29:31 blow a bunch of smoke up your ass about
29:32 Isis and you know whatever the latest
29:36 organization they have out there but
29:38 someone can come in on the military
29:40 level and say we as human beings just
29:42 sign that sign up here for the military
29:43 and we'll go kick their asses and so we
29:46 can solve it but what's NASA sell you
29:49 coronal mass ejections and the next big
29:52 one is you know killer asteroids
29:56 meteorites what they have coined as
30:00 earth killer
30:02 now the sudden what happens the human
30:06 beings that can save your life are now
30:09 quarantined inside these two companies
30:11 called NASA JPL without them and without
30:14 their exorbitant budgets which are
30:17 actually military budgets for the most
30:19 part right I mean what's funny about it
30:23 is just to digress into that point for
30:25 one second think about how many times
30:27 the Space Shuttle went up and we were
30:30 told as the people here's the big finger
30:33 you can't you can't know what's inside
30:35 the space shuttle it's military almost
30:40 like okay so let's see the line-item on
30:43 on the ledger here that the military
30:45 paid for that [ __ ] paid for the [ __ ]
30:48 gas paid for everyone's salaries I want
30:51 to see where the ledger went over to a
30:53 military industrial complex payoff but
30:55 it never happens
30:56 right it's NASA pays for [ __ ]
30:58 everything the doomsday stuff is always
31:02 always always mapped to and coordinated
31:07 at a time timeline with the budgetary
31:12 approvals of these organizations so if
31:14 NASA is coming up and eating their
31:16 budgets their annual budget approved by
31:18 the Acting President United States they
31:21 pay money they take the money we've
31:24 given them and they they go off in many
31:28 directions wasting I would say tens of
31:31 millions of dollars if not hundreds of
31:32 millions of dollars creating these
31:34 doomsday scenarios and then paying for
31:37 the press to put this stuff out there
31:40 such that we as the laymen down below
31:45 believe it and that should be a little
31:50 infuriating once you think about it one
31:53 of the funniest things when you get into
31:54 computer-generated imagery in Hollywood
31:57 is that you know there's a couple
32:00 different types of folks to get into it
32:02 you know there's the folks that tell
32:03 people what to do and they don't know
32:05 [ __ ] I mean they know it's possible yada
32:08 yada but they never double-click the 3d
32:10 application they've never created a
32:11 polygon in their life they've never
32:13 created a UV map the debri animated
32:15 anything yours truly got in as early as
32:21 one could you know the one thing my
32:23 computer teacher didn't know how to do
32:25 in school was projecting a 2d plane of a
32:30 3d image and memory which was kind of
32:32 interesting so when I came to California
32:34 I got heavily into that technology which
32:37 then obviously became the way video
32:38 games do it today but when I see after
32:43 nearly 30 years of looking at this [ __ ]
32:46 well I guess 30 years now when I see
32:50 this [ __ ] coming out of NASA JPL when
32:52 they tell us that they are flying a
32:55 probe to an asteroid I see the horrible
33:03 CG modeling in these asteroids I see the
33:07 texturing problems
33:09 I see the you know compression
33:11 algorithms whoever is doing these fake
33:14 meteorite images I have been stuck in a
33:18 cave for so [ __ ] long there must be
33:19 using software from like the early 90s
33:21 because all the anomalies that we got
33:24 past everything that we we worked and
33:27 slaved over to make it photo real isn't
33:31 present and these images which are
33:34 essentially you know they're essentially
33:35 taking a photograph of a nemesis and
33:38 they're trying to scare everybody
33:41 they're trying to create they're trying
33:44 to incite a riot and in a way you know
33:48 when HG Wells and and well sorry when
33:52 Orson Welles did HG Wells you know when
33:57 he did the world the world's right I
33:58 believe it's like in 39 or something
34:01 like that you know gets on that radio
34:02 and he tells the world that Martians are
34:04 invading and they didn't break for any
34:06 commercials and they made it feel like
34:08 it was totally real and there's huge
34:10 panic on the East Coast and around the
34:12 United States he got in some serious
34:14 trouble for inciting a riot but today
34:18 they've kind of figured out a way to
34:19 kind of keep it from a riot but how many
34:21 hit for those of you who have Omni
34:24 magazine back issues popular science
34:27 Popular Mechanics Scientific American
34:30 when you have all these magazines you
34:32 look up how many covers of these
34:35 magazines have that that impact
34:37 photograph right where the [ __ ]
34:39 meteorites hitting Earth and it's just
34:41 you know it's just blowing the [ __ ] out
34:43 of our planet right it's like the thing
34:45 is impacting and it's the size of North
34:47 America like in one shot we're all dead
34:50 but in my opinion the majority of all
34:53 the stuff we've ever seen I haven't
34:55 personally seen anything convincing you
34:59 have meteorites again with these round
35:01 impacts on them supposedly right well
35:04 it's doesn't look like a crater to me
35:06 every single impact is perfectly round
35:08 which means that a perpendicular impact
35:10 to a completely nebulous looking potato
35:13 turd in space right it always comes up
35:16 it always comes up before budget time
35:21 consequently on the outside of the space
35:23 program it's very interesting how
35:25 massive fires tend to show up about
35:28 every 10 years in regions where the fire
35:30 departments have to get budgeting a
35:32 budgeting upgrades for their helicopters
35:35 their firefighting you know cargo planes
35:38 when they you know someone needs a raise
35:40 you know we have this blazing fire that
35:43 takes out a few houses and then it just
35:44 seems to go away for about ten years and
35:46 all the press this is the funny part
35:49 when the press talks about it either
35:50 NASA or is something else it is always
35:54 the undertow subtextual meaning of the
35:57 broadcast that this is why it's so good
36:01 we have these organizations what's the
36:04 theory what is the theory behind finding
36:07 an asteroid coming towards Earth and
36:09 these space organizations pretty much a
36:13 last second notification this is going
36:15 to occur do you think the president
36:18 United States is going to get out there
36:19 and jump up on a microphone and go we're
36:22 all [ __ ] doomed this thing is coming
36:24 kiss your loved one yeah they're not
36:28 going to let us know if it really
36:30 happens they're never going to let us
36:31 know so why are we paying for it the
36:32 first place right but again we've been
36:35 on this planet for a very long time the
36:38 movies been up there for a very long
36:39 time and at no point in recorded history
36:41 have we ever seen an impact on either
36:43 one of these objects and now that we
36:45 look at craters it looks like they're
36:47 all bubbling little pops from the inside
36:51 of the planet again Diamondhead looks
36:53 exactly like the crater in Arizona
36:55 exactly the only difference is diamond
36:57 heads in a lush tropical world and the
36:59 other ones in a desert I tell you one is
37:02 a volcano ones that asteroid complete
37:05 horseshit but how does this you know
37:09 nebulous looking again potato looking
37:12 thing in space how does that have any
37:14 sort of internal bubbling to create all
37:17 these little perfect round circles it's
37:21 because it doesn't exist and NASA is
37:24 merely taken what you see on the moon
37:26 that made it look space like with it's
37:29 completely ridiculous surfaces I mean
37:32 these surfaces are always
37:34 smooth right we always have texturing
37:36 problems you can even see where the UV
37:38 map which is where you take a for those
37:41 of you not in 3d the way this works is
37:42 that we create essentially a piece of
37:44 wallpaper and on that wallpaper is
37:47 whatever texture you know you want the
37:49 surface of whatever you're going to put
37:51 this wallpaper around looks like and so
37:54 UV mapping is merely the technique of
37:56 saying your kids created this paper
37:58 mache bizarre-looking potato and you
38:01 come in with the wallpaper and you're
38:03 trying to make the wallpaper connect
38:04 around this weird object in a way that
38:07 you know all the seams connect so the
38:10 pattern never breaks around this weird
38:12 shape now when it's a nebulous sort of
38:16 gray pattern it's a hell of a lot easier
38:18 to bring these edges together but they
38:21 actually publish these bad UV map
38:23 asteroids assuming that you're going to
38:26 think it's some orbital stitching right
38:28 well you know we take several pictures
38:30 of it and when you stitch it all
38:32 together
38:32 how convenient right what else is nice
38:36 to get into well name a doomsday earth
38:40 killing piece of science anything with
38:44 volcanic eruptions global warming right
38:48 let's not call it climate change global
38:51 warming the the heat of the water in the
38:53 ocean sure yeah NASA's right there every
38:59 [ __ ] time Fukushima not so much
39:03 hookahs even that's killing every single
39:05 fish in the Pacific a lot of talk about
39:08 that we're gonna do an episode on
39:11 Fukushima here soon let's say this big
39:14 objects coming towards Earth you know in
39:17 the way that you find these things if
39:18 they take a picture of space and then a
39:21 few seconds later take another picture
39:22 and then it the computer looks at the
39:26 two images overlays them and if a star
39:28 seems to move between the two
39:29 photographs they know that's an object
39:31 that's moving and then they lock in on
39:34 it and take a lot more pictures and
39:35 supposedly they're triangulating its
39:37 vector trying to see if it's coming at
39:38 Earth right how many times in your
39:41 lifetime I'm in my late 40s
39:44 I don't know there's probably been at
39:46 least a dozen reports of super close
39:50 mega asteroids coming next to earth and
39:53 no one has ever videotaped them ever
39:55 alright supposedly you can look up and
39:58 see a satellite moving it's a star that
40:00 moves in a nice orbital pattern right
40:01 well why can't we see something as
40:04 massive as these [ __ ] earth killer
40:07 things they keep talking about right
40:09 when the three asteroids hit Jupiter
40:12 they had a heyday because they were able
40:15 to say see you know one of these things
40:18 is as big as Earth supposedly going into
40:21 the bowels of Jupiter did not come out
40:23 the other side so whatever happened
40:26 inside that impact I would love to have
40:27 seen because it must have been crazy
40:30 huge but we're supposed to be able to
40:33 send you know some like Armageddon like
40:36 Bruce Willis's Armageddon where you send
40:38 up a bunch of astronauts on some you
40:40 know some asteroids video game thing and
40:44 you go up and you start shooting it and
40:46 putting rockets on it and heating up one
40:48 side to make it go in a different
40:50 direction we can't even get back to the
40:53 moon right you know you go with their
40:56 official story that they actually went
40:57 there which they didn't you know made an
41:00 episode in season 2 called NASA's fake
41:04 space programs or faked space programs
41:06 and I'm sort of bummed I did it because
41:08 I guess I could do a part two on it
41:12 because the evidence against everything
41:15 that they're claiming to have done just
41:18 keeps piling up and piling up and piling
41:20 up we now have these compilation videos
41:24 on YouTube if you haven't seen them or
41:26 you can watch the astronauts faking
41:28 doing their 360 rotations there on
41:31 harness wires just like David
41:34 Copperfield in the early 90s they have
41:36 to wires off the back of their pants
41:37 around their waist
41:38 you've got astronauts reaching over
41:40 grabbing the wire to help steady a guy a
41:42 big and you have you have astronauts
41:45 grabbing their wires because they didn't
41:47 do the flip right broadcast live on
41:50 television obviously a blue screen
41:52 behind them in some cases you could
41:55 probably just build a set for some of
41:57 that
41:58 it's pathetic how fake this stuff is all
42:02 this footage from the ISS which is
42:04 running all over Facebook and YouTube
42:06 alright show me the [ __ ] moon from
42:08 the ISS why don't you you're right there
42:10 you have a great shot you have probably
42:13 the best shot of anyone who's alive but
42:15 you never do it because it's a set they
42:18 have these guys that do these one-hour
42:20 spacewalks
42:21 to provide live imagery down to earth of
42:25 Earth from space from the ISS with these
42:28 horrible you know fisheye lens is that
42:32 they put on these cameras to give you
42:33 the sense that they're so high the earth
42:34 is this round ball but every time they
42:36 move the camera you can see the fish
42:38 Islands correct the curve since the
42:40 curve continues to repeat itself through
42:42 Windows and that kind of thing because
42:44 it's a set it's a rear projection said
42:46 we're paying for deception we're paying
42:49 for this notion that we could somehow
42:51 access an asteroid years and years and
42:55 years before it gets to us right imagine
42:58 of rock the size of Rhode Island coming
43:00 at Earth and you send up a bunch of
43:04 nuclear weapons and you just slam them
43:08 straight into the surface and they're
43:09 hundred Megaton bombs or whatever the
43:11 hell you think you're going to do to
43:12 vaporize and cause a little ticking it's
43:14 and it's vector towards you right you
43:17 want to change its vector just a little
43:19 bit if you change its velocity a little
43:22 bit even if it's the size of New York
43:25 City all right get this big thing coming
43:28 at you and now you're going to put up a
43:29 little tic-tac that's going to spark you
43:32 know it's almost like those little
43:33 little things that you buy and they look
43:37 like little sperm tadpoles and you throw
43:40 them on the ground they go snap it's
43:42 like throwing that at the ground and
43:43 expecting the earth to move so here's
43:47 the thing just to rewind and look at
43:49 this doomsday [ __ ] one if there's an
43:53 earth color coming at Earth ain't no one
43:55 going to tell you in the first place so
43:57 why the hell we pain to know why are we
43:59 paying to know know if it hits earth no
44:01 one's going to be able to get that
44:03 deposit out and go to the Bahamas you
44:05 know what the the rich elite need more
44:10 [ __ ] leisure time
44:11 before an impact I don't think so they
44:13 do whatever the [ __ ] they want
44:14 constantly right we're never going to be
44:17 told and there's nothing they can do to
44:19 change that's fate nothing so why pay
44:23 for it they can't keep a camera on from
44:27 a launch all the way to its destination
44:30 they got plenty of power it's a digital
44:32 camera and ain't got a bunch of 35
44:34 millimeter film with you know perforated
44:38 holes to keep everything aligned it's
44:40 just a digital camera and they are
44:41 unable to keep a camera on from the
44:43 second it launches at Cape Canaveral all
44:46 the way to the surface of Mars right
44:49 they can't they've created this [ __ ]
44:53 about the 5 to 10 minute blackout period
44:57 when a little bit other words that the
44:58 lunar module and now of course the
45:01 shuttle and any other reentry vehicle
45:03 comes back to earth so they can switch
45:05 cameras that's all the reason that's the
45:08 only reason well that a whole bunch of
45:10 hocus pocus science was invented because
45:12 you have this you know this vehicle
45:14 coming in and now we have to switch to
45:16 the problem
45:18 the astronauts seemingly thought of the
45:21 sky in a lunar module and had parachutes
45:25 and a big three big giant parachutes
45:27 attached to them and then of course and
45:28 when swoops in to rescue the astronaut
45:30 they blow the hatch well you could track
45:33 it and watch it and communicate with
45:35 them be a hell of a lot harder but right
45:39 now what's happening is that NASA is
45:41 done JPL is largely done in the eyes of
45:44 people we're probably not a 50-percent
45:47 yet but we're approaching a 50 percent
45:49 awakening of the amount of people in the
45:52 modern world in first world countries
45:53 that know that they're full of [ __ ]
45:54 you'd be surprised that a lot of third
45:57 world countries already know they're
45:58 full of [ __ ] but that might be due to
46:00 propaganda and just you know nationalism
46:02 in their local area so they know the
46:06 clock is ticking and so they have spun
46:10 up these side companies to take the
46:13 responsibility of NASA off surgically
46:15 they're probably going to create
46:17 somewhere around you know two or three
46:19 dozen space X's and charter them all for
46:22 whatever individual responsibility
46:25 NASA head so you might have your your
46:27 doomsday division runs off and there one
46:30 particular company well you know SpaceX
46:32 fakes a bunch of missiles or a bunch of
46:34 you know Rockets going up and landing
46:37 back down as they cut the feed just as
46:39 the camera lands I mean give me a
46:40 [ __ ] break if you guys saw this but
46:43 you know those of us is CG we look at
46:46 the imagery of the landings and they're
46:48 missing most of the frames it would take
46:50 to pull this thing off but there's just
46:52 telltale signs of particle systems of
46:57 compositing all this other stuff in
46:59 their imagery they never invite the
47:01 press to ever witness the landing life
47:04 which is why they put her down in the
47:06 ocean they did another ocean landing
47:08 where the camera is filming the landing
47:12 pad right and there oh my god they're
47:15 all this telemetry and [ __ ] going on the
47:16 camera and the second is supposed to
47:18 land oopsy
47:20 they lost the camera feed due to a
47:22 satellite alignment problem mm-hmm but
47:27 my cell phone works on that [ __ ]
47:28 platform and then all sudden the camera
47:30 comes back on and the rocket is right
47:32 there because it was craned on to the
47:36 platform in the middle of the cut and
47:39 everyone's thinking this heroic Yeley
47:43 screamy crowd you know if you've ever
47:44 seen a movie where they you have either
47:46 a celebration a celebratory crowd it's
47:50 like hey you know we blew up the Death
47:51 Star yay no Rob or someone's you know
47:54 rioting right if you're mildly aware of
47:58 how humanity really behaves in these
48:00 situations there's always a level of
48:02 fiction in their behavior what they yell
48:04 how they scream expression on their face
48:06 it's really really tough to get extras
48:08 to do that kind of stuff legitimately
48:10 because they're not really unified in
48:13 some fiction each one of the extras is
48:16 thinking of a different thing that they
48:18 think they're seeing and depending on
48:19 how articulate the director is and how
48:21 persistent is to get the shot they let
48:23 [ __ ] slide all the time well this live
48:26 spacex sort of gang you know you know i
48:30 don't know if you know but you know when
48:32 they do like MTV Music Awards they put
48:34 all the fake dip shits down by the front
48:37 stage to pretend like they give a [ __ ]
48:38 where
48:39 Beyonce's pregnant or not same thing if
48:43 you have these just fake-ass you know
48:46 celebratory jumping around stuff and of
48:49 course all the people in charge are kind
48:51 of looking on like dammit we are lying
48:52 our asses off and stealing hundreds of
48:54 millions of dollars from the people and
48:55 so they're never that excited just like
48:58 the astronauts that came back from the
48:59 moon and the Apollo 11 mission they sat
49:02 there terrified that the scan was going
49:05 to be exposed right you know my opinion
49:08 all this shit's fake all of it and there
49:12 seems to be this you know living in
49:14 Southern California especially there's a
49:17 lot of engineers of NASA that live in
49:20 this area and you'll bump into their
49:22 family members and I've said this before
49:23 but you'll get your get an argument with
49:28 some of the family members because when
49:29 you tell them that this [ __ ] never
49:31 really happened they get very upsetting
49:33 who well my father built the bolts that
49:35 were on the door of the Apollo 11 well
49:37 my dad engineered this and Antonis and
49:39 you look at him like yeah he did
49:41 he totally did and he did probably did a
49:44 great job and how we are actually gone
49:47 to the moon those bolts probably would
49:48 have done their thing on reentry perhaps
49:50 they did it when the lunar module came
49:52 back down and landed after being pushed
49:54 out of a you know c-130 equivalent right
49:57 but I'm stealing from them this sort of
50:02 stolen pride you know you know my
50:06 parents you know if one of my parents
50:08 was some super scientist and invented I
50:10 don't know [ __ ] cure for cancer or
50:12 whatever actually got us to the moon or
50:13 whatever that's not me that's them I
50:17 have to do my own thing make my own mark
50:21 on society sure you might be able to do
50:23 some mad to go out while everybody who's
50:24 really smart because his parents are
50:26 smart maybe everyone knows the [ __ ]
50:29 that has brilliant parents there's no
50:31 one-to-one correlation there I want to
50:34 make this episode to catch up on some of
50:36 this content it's more esoteric to kind
50:38 of surrounds NASA but I just want you to
50:42 see just as a blatant black sheep this
50:47 scam of selling doomsday to the people
50:50 and I want to beg
50:52 you to stop repeating this [ __ ] as if
50:54 it's real right stop talking about Q
50:58 Emmys knocking out our power supply here
51:00 on earth right you have to understand
51:03 that the second the power goes out as
51:05 much as the power companies lose money
51:07 they make a [ __ ] ton of money as a
51:09 result of coming back on and doing all
51:12 the repairs and surcharging because now
51:14 I got to re throw the entire [ __ ]
51:16 power grid I want you to remember this
51:19 we subsidize the [ __ ] out of bridges
51:22 nuclear power plants like the local
51:25 community gets taxed to build these
51:26 [ __ ] things and then the
51:28 corporation's swoop in or the state
51:30 swoops in and keeps the money turned
51:32 back on right we'll build an entire
51:34 nuclear power plant with private sector
51:37 money with people's money tax right out
51:39 of the district and as soon as the
51:41 goddamn thing comes online they hand it
51:43 over to Edison and Edison immediately
51:45 charges us a profit well that must be
51:48 nice right hey guys once you build me a
51:51 money-making machine once you build me
51:52 an ATM and then put money in it for me
51:55 every day because I want infinite cash
51:57 and so this whole green movement that's
52:00 popped out of last 10-15 years has been
52:02 a scam of doing global warming [ __ ]
52:06 forcing us to go green using district
52:09 money and local state money and federal
52:12 money to rebuild the infrastructure that
52:14 then will be immediately handed over to
52:17 the energy corporations to charge us
52:19 money for [ __ ] we paid for any time
52:22 something becomes a strategic resource
52:24 it must be absolutely price controlled
52:27 and hopefully the price has to be the
52:29 lowest possible price of the highest
52:31 possible quality right so oxygen water
52:34 now electricity electricity shouldn't be
52:38 allowed to be a private-sector commodity
52:40 because we cannot live in a modern
52:42 society without electricity one could
52:46 contest that Internet is the strategic
52:48 resource at no point should an ISP be
52:51 able to charge me for internet
52:52 connection at my house it should be a
52:54 state controlled commodity because I
52:57 have to have it I don't have to have
53:00 television I don't have to have Netflix
53:02 or HBO GO those could be private sector
53:05 things
53:06 and hell if I'm not paying a luxury tax
53:08 for everything that's a mandatory thing
53:10 for me to survive like water right then
53:14 I can afford to pay a little bit more
53:15 for HBO go they can go from 1199 or
53:17 whatever the [ __ ] it is to $19.99
53:19 whatever my garbage absolutely has to be
53:22 collected otherwise the world turns into
53:24 a [ __ ] pile really right they gouge the
53:28 [ __ ] out of us and Southern California
53:29 pretending like they actually recycle
53:31 anything you know everything goes on a
53:33 shipping cart directly to China to be
53:35 burned up and turned into our toys all
53:38 right
53:38 we ship a bunch of aluminum over
53:40 everything that comes back is you know a
53:43 thousand decks what they paid for the
53:45 actual aluminum because we're giving it
53:46 to them for damn near free right we're a
53:49 little out base but I thought I thought
53:52 I would tie all that stuff together so
53:54 what do we do with NASA let's conclude
53:56 with that idea and I'll probably retouch
53:59 on this with other episodes but honestly
54:03 speaking what do you do with the corrupt
54:04 organization anywhere in the world right
54:06 what happened to Enron after we found
54:08 out that they were a complete [ __ ]
54:09 organization built by you know george
54:12 george w bush's college roommate what do
54:17 we do we shut it down unfortunately
54:20 people get hurt because they have their
54:22 401 KS decide the stock options of the
54:24 company we can deal with that separately
54:26 bail these people out a little bit the
54:29 executives need to go to jail inside
54:33 NASA you have a bunch of people who are
54:35 innocent
54:36 probably a overwhelming majority in the
54:38 90 percentile rating and then you have
54:41 somewhere hidden in the Fort Knox bunker
54:44 of JPL just try to go to JPL in Pasadena
54:48 and tell me how that goes for those
54:51 individuals who have crafted software
54:53 who had no idea how it was going to be
54:54 used and eventually gets used to create
54:56 fake terrain photographs to sell back to
54:58 the people and what blows my mind is
55:01 people will watch the Matt Damon movie
55:06 Martian and they're looking at the
55:09 Martian surface and it looks exactly
55:10 like the photographs even better and no
55:13 one asks the question how the [ __ ] did
55:14 they create that hard that those
55:16 terrains it's made with the project
55:18 called taragan for
55:19 Karajan for is in its fourth version you
55:22 can go download it on your computer
55:23 today and there's another there's
55:25 another one too that does it now if I
55:27 forgot its name but I play with it as
55:29 well you can make these terrains in your
55:32 computer so you think the stuffs of real
55:36 really ask the GPL is most likely just
55:41 to cover a cover story for all the
55:43 military development I'm not sure in
55:46 this day and age we need to actually
55:48 veneer evil with good objectives I think
55:51 actually people are so convinced that
55:55 these terrorist organizations exists or
55:57 the Russkies want to get us get us or
55:59 kim jung woon is going to come over and
56:00 go a nuclear bomb and to Seattle
56:02 Washington or something that they would
56:04 probably pay for it without being lied
56:06 to
56:08 what's interesting right now in the
56:10 world is that there are a bunch of
56:11 people that haven't really formally
56:13 organized some have for the Flat Earth
56:17 thing but just take heliocentric normal
56:19 old NASA we haven't we haven't have seen
56:23 someone create an organization that goes
56:25 after them 100% holds them accountable
56:27 for what they say they're going to do
56:29 some of us remember being you know I was
56:32 a total space junkie when I was a kid
56:34 science junkie nasa junkie didn't really
56:36 know who JPL was but it would always
56:38 come up and in conversations but when
56:41 the space shuttle used to go up in the
56:42 late 70s early 80s you had experiments
56:47 that they did and they were on the hook
56:51 to show the public but what are you
56:53 doing up there we're spending a ton of
56:54 money what are you doing they have not
56:57 shown us a modicum of focus of real
57:01 intent to do anything scientific Tharpe
57:03 they're [ __ ] around doing nothing and
57:05 that's per their claims of being there
57:08 right like I said these fisheye lenses
57:12 and they have a guy out there for an
57:14 hour just filming the earth to give us
57:16 this false sense that they're they're
57:19 the false sense perhaps that it's round
57:21 you know that might sound crazy but it's
57:24 like take off the fisheye lens just film
57:27 it with a normal rectilinear lens that
57:30 shows us exactly what you're seeing out
57:32 of your eye
57:32 it's time someone hold these
57:34 organizations accountable and we're just
57:36 sort of amassing the brainpower and our
57:41 strategies of how to best walk into a
57:43 town hall meeting with Neil deGrasse
57:45 Tyson and you know Bill Nye the douche
57:49 bag guy and and just level these guys to
57:53 the ground with a few examples imagine
57:56 being on that show and you bring the
57:57 real end of the composite it's like two
57:58 of two minutes and 50 seconds of all the
58:01 astronauts faking their rotations
58:03 grabbing wires imagine that going out on
58:05 national television be interesting to
58:08 see those guys squirm and their
58:09 horseshit we're almost there we're
58:13 almost there and you know why they can't
58:14 stop us making these videos they can't
58:16 sure YouTube can do whatever knockout ad
58:20 revenue I don't need any ad revenue to
58:22 run this show I'm not make anything
58:24 that's horrendous it's also on vid mean
58:26 there's Vimeo and there's a bunch of
58:28 other places I can take it if they would
58:30 ever try to choke us out I can put it on
58:33 my own website you just download the
58:34 freaking movie file they can't stop us I
58:39 think that's about it we love to hear
58:44 your feedback now for those of you are
58:45 big flattered actors I understand you're
58:46 just kind of rolling your eyes about the
58:48 whole notion that I'm I'm there but you
58:50 know what even if you're a flat earther
58:52 let me just let me just invite you to
58:54 this party anyway
58:56 turn off your Flat Earth brain for one
58:59 second and turn on back on your
59:00 traditional heliocentric world if you
59:04 want to beat NASA don't try to be in
59:05 with Flat Earth right again we are still
59:09 miles and miles away from anyone proving
59:11 it's flat great we hit we haven't had
59:14 someone go the Antarctica and find the
59:16 wall right no one's proven there's a
59:18 firmament Dome etc etc now that's been
59:20 done so until you have the smoking gun
59:22 in your world I'm telling you right now
59:24 you could beat them at their own game
59:27 you can beat them at their own game
59:29 just by demanding accountability if the
59:32 government understands one thing it's
59:34 accountability they don't like to do it
59:37 but they understand it so let's focus on
59:41 accountability
59:43 let's reset who gets to go to space if
59:48 you're inside these organizations and
59:50 for whatever reason you made it through
59:51 this entire video either laughing or
59:54 paying attention going our [ __ ] yeah
59:55 he's right do me a favor leak something
59:59 out leaks on an incredible smoking gun
60:02 out the door I'm sure it's very
60:04 difficult to find one to be honest
60:06 these organizations are heavily
60:07 compartmentalized but you know thing is
60:12 if you're a scientist and you know what
60:13 the hell you're talking about
60:15 wouldn't you rather work for an
60:16 organization where every day you came to
60:18 work and you actually accomplished
60:19 something that had to do with what you
60:21 thought you were going to be doing as a
60:23 child you know the two guys that
60:25 debriefed me about the moon missions
60:28 being a fake who were combined over 30
60:31 years working for NASA they resigned
60:34 after being given the I given the offer
60:36 of having an infinite paycheck for the
60:39 rest of their lives to lie about going
60:40 to Mars they quit that people roll their
60:45 eyes to me every once while I tell mr.
60:46 I'm like fine quit your [ __ ] job what
60:50 do you do for the homeless okay okay so
60:52 imagine you no longer do that anymore
60:54 you put all of your money in your in
60:57 your college degree you put all that
60:58 time into learning how to do that and
61:00 you pop out of that industry and you
61:01 never go back because you found out that
61:03 you have been lied to so badly that you
61:05 don't want to be a part of the lie I
61:08 know very few people on planet earth
61:11 that have ever quit their jobs it's
61:13 usually always someone on TV that I've
61:14 seen you know some operatives somewhere
61:17 who realizes he's overthrowing countries
61:19 like the economic hitman who by the way
61:22 finished his career and then wrote the
61:23 book about how he [ __ ] all these
61:24 countries over in South America so sort
61:27 of a pseudo hero if there ever was one
61:29 but the two guys that I talked to back
61:32 in 1991
61:33 they weren't messing around they were
61:35 working at the company I was working for
61:37 and so there you go they quit they
61:42 change industries completely from
61:44 aerospace to like computer programming
61:46 so help you feel me
61:48 deep thoughts radio.com for all the
61:50 feeds
61:51 we have switched over all the feeds to
61:53 that domain so if you're coming in
61:55 through a
61:56 a video and you're wondering why your
61:58 podcast isn't updating again it takes me
62:00 sometimes that's about $40 to get the
62:02 podcast up-to-date because I always wait
62:04 for the video to render first and then
62:06 life gets busy from time to time but
62:08 definitely go over there and hit the
62:09 podcast link inside your device that
62:11 you're on the Android you're coming on
62:13 the Apple just go to iTunes and search
62:15 on deep thoughts radio for any of you
62:18 who do like iTunes we could use some
62:19 reviews over there if you dig the show
62:22 we save that to the end because then
62:24 people who hate it will never hear this
62:25 recommendation if you having problems
62:27 watching season one due to copyright
62:29 issues on YouTube please go to vid me
62:33 for season one or just go to deep
62:35 thoughts radio comm and click on
62:36 episodes and rewind the feed back to
62:39 season one and everything is in there
62:41 and it's perfect perfect the way I did
62:45 it formats and I think it's odd 52 even
62:51 in America has been completely gagged
62:53 for audio for some goddamn reason
62:55 I don't the deal is so YouTube may or
62:59 may not survive for the next ten years
63:01 and the way that we understand it to
63:02 exist but there are competitors coming
63:04 out every day so hopefully they don't go
63:06 under we have to support them so they
63:07 they don't go under right there is
63:10 patreon for anyone who wants to donate
63:12 the goal is to buy an HD camera for
63:15 season three but we didn't hit any of
63:17 that goal that's fine
63:18 if we miraculously raise that money
63:21 we'll simply buy at the middle the
63:22 episode they shed will get even tighter
63:24 I'm not looking forward to rendering 4k
63:27 versions on my computer but we're ready
63:30 anyway take care of yourself in someone
63:32 else and I'll see you in the next deep
63:34 thoughts over now
