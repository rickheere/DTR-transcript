00:33 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:35 gentlemen today I am rear according a
00:39 rear according a 17 we're gonna change
00:43 the name from cancer to how to fight
00:48 cancer now the first time I created the
00:51 show just a little bit of history I was
00:54 pretty angry at the subject matter and
00:56 so my mouth was pretty uh pretty vile
00:59 then I recorded it and accidentally
01:03 reversed the format of the show where
01:06 the cures were at the end or the
01:08 treatments of the other things you can
01:09 use to fight cancer and all the causes
01:11 were at the beginning if you're watching
01:14 this you want the cures / treatments the
01:18 people that people have used right I
01:20 call them cures for a very specific
01:21 reason because people use these
01:22 techniques around the world to avoid
01:26 cancer and to get rid of it after
01:29 they've caught this horrible man-made
01:33 thing after I get through with the
01:37 treatments we have to cover how you get
01:40 it so what is probably just as important
01:44 is the how you get it as well as how to
01:48 prevent it you know how to get rid of it
01:52 once you get it a little bit of
01:54 background for myself so you know who I
01:56 am in case this is literally the first
01:59 video you've ever seen in this
02:00 particular channel some of this might
02:03 sound a little hard to believe but or
02:08 doesn't seem to have level credibility
02:10 that you think it should I have taken
02:13 people through these treatments at least
02:15 one treatment three times people in
02:19 stage 4 2 and stage 4 one in stage 3 my
02:23 background with cancer is not that I
02:25 have any one of my family that has had
02:26 you know a tremendous case of but I have
02:28 one remember my family eat a lot of
02:30 saccharine back in the day and ended up
02:33 getting colon cancer it's the only case
02:36 of cancer in my entire family but I had
02:38 a
02:39 I had a teacher who was my science
02:44 teacher physics teacher trigonometry
02:47 teacher programming teacher astronomy
02:49 and sound waves teacher and his wife had
02:51 passed away of cancer a few years before
02:54 I got to his classes and so as he taught
02:57 everything from sound waves ultra you
03:01 know ultraviolet light x-rays physics he
03:04 managed to incorporate cancer-causing
03:08 methodologies into his class such that
03:11 we would have at a very young age at
03:13 fifteen sixteen years old the very
03:15 foundation to think about this for the
03:17 rest of our lives
03:17 and then I particularly got obsessed
03:19 with it and continually researched all
03:24 different types of cancers how they
03:25 occur from you know photo cancer to
03:30 electron cancer to chemical cancers
03:32 carcinogen cancers and so when I heard
03:37 about a lot of these treatments they
03:39 make sense to me on an atomic level and
03:41 I'll get to that as we go through each
03:44 one of the therapies that you can use
03:46 but I have a friend of mine that had
03:48 stage 4 cancer she was given a six month
03:50 death sentence which was you know the
03:54 most unbelievable piece of news you
03:58 could possibly get about your life is
03:59 that you're going to die in six months
04:01 you will not make it past six months she
04:04 used one of the techniques I'm gonna
04:05 feature right at the very beginning here
04:07 so you're gonna have this in five
04:08 minutes
04:09 and she was cancer-free in four months
04:13 full remission never touched a single
04:16 drop of chemotherapy her doctor thought
04:19 she went to chemotherapy and she just
04:23 lied to him and said yep sure did and
04:26 boy it worked great and so that doctor
04:28 patting himself on the back
04:29 she never poisoned herself with that
04:31 stuff and she is alive living a
04:34 wonderful life with no worries of ever
04:36 catching cancer again because she's on
04:39 this vitamin regimen daily which will
04:42 help avoid ever catching it so again
04:46 instead of putting a bunch of background
04:49 first
04:50 as to how you catch things we're gonna
04:52 go into the Cure's the other thing about
04:55 my background is I did work as a
04:56 software engineer in the pharmaceutical
04:59 industry developing a covert project
05:02 where I was one of the two guys the
05:05 other guy worked with was double blinded
05:06 from knowing what we were doing but what
05:09 I did was I created a drug inception
05:10 product were scientists the head chemist
05:13 would use my product to track their
05:17 ideas of course it's their idea to me
05:19 and I would turn it into software and
05:21 then I headed over to clinical studies
05:24 to work on that and I did that for just
05:27 a little bit shy I think if little shy
05:28 of two years I think I'd have to go back
05:31 and look at all the all the pay stubs to
05:34 figure out exactly held on that was but
05:35 I was 23 and 24 years old at this level
05:39 my science background was extremely
05:41 helpful and if you go and watch all my
05:43 other episodes you'll get a good
05:46 estimation of you know the level of
05:49 science that I apply to all things so
05:52 I'm telling you these things not as some
05:53 folklore you know treatments that hey
05:57 man I don't know how it works we're
06:00 gonna get to the very specifics of it
06:02 where I don't know something I'll be
06:04 very clear to you let's talk about
06:09 treatment number one and so far it is
06:11 the number one treatment that I have
06:14 heard work however I have heard that
06:17 there's a more powerful one but it's a
06:19 little bit more involved and there's an
06:21 element of it that people can't quite
06:23 stomach doing even though it's
06:25 absolutely painless all of these
06:27 treatments I believe are relatively
06:30 completely painless and you could do
06:33 them at the same exact time that you're
06:34 doing other therapies that your doctor
06:36 recommends just in case you have worries
06:38 that someone on the Internet is crazy
06:40 and that they're lying about people
06:43 getting cured of this stuff
06:44 I assure you my results have been
06:48 unanimous all right for each person I've
06:52 helped with this very first technique
06:53 they were given this technique by
06:56 someone else at the same exact time so
06:57 I'm three out of three for me sending
06:59 over the regimen and like one or more
07:02 people and their side of the
07:04 gave them the exact same treatment they
07:06 used the treatment and they got
07:07 completely cured and there's a fourth
07:11 that was debuted on my previous show
07:14 which no longer exists which pointed me
07:17 in this particular direction and it's
07:21 another cure that which is part of the
07:26 first cure here and he also gave it to
07:29 his cat and the cat was cured as well so
07:32 it's very very powerful but the very
07:36 first treatment you can use to rid
07:39 yourself of cancer is a regiment of two
07:41 vitamins and that's it one of the most
07:46 powerful weapons we have against cancer
07:48 and is a vitamin that you may have never
07:51 heard of because it cures cancer it
07:54 fights cancer and it allows your body to
07:57 really do most of the work so when I say
08:00 this cures cancer it is that it is an
08:03 augmentation to your immune system
08:04 allowing your immune system do nothing
08:06 but kill cancer it's a beautiful thing
08:08 the vitamins b-17 b-17 is something that
08:12 is extracted from the pits of an apricot
08:16 you don't really need to know how that
08:18 works I recommend you get powdered
08:20 versions of the pill you can actually
08:23 eat apricot pits throughout the year
08:26 every day they're very bitter and they
08:29 even say look you probably don't need
08:31 more than a couple of these a day the
08:34 b-17 is something that works on an
08:37 atomic level now we're gonna get into
08:39 this atomic thing in just one second but
08:42 the second thing you take at the same
08:43 exact time you're taking b-17 and the
08:46 regiments that I've heard is for an
08:47 average 150 180 pound person you take a
08:50 thousand milligrams a day which would be
08:52 go get a 500 milligram pill cost you
08:57 about a hundred bucks a bottle take it
08:59 twice a day
09:01 now go price chemotherapy and all your
09:04 other oncology and hundred dollars a
09:06 bottle will seem like it's free what's
09:09 interesting is is you don't find b-17 in
09:11 any of the drugstores even Amazon
09:15 doesn't help you buy it but a lot of
09:18 websites specialize in apricot
09:21 b-seventeen pills again this is being
09:26 kept out of your view because it will
09:29 cure you and oncology is a trillion
09:32 dollar a decade business they we're
09:36 going to get into the politics of that I
09:37 actually should stop but you know it's a
09:39 scam it's a scam on a massive level and
09:42 there's a lot of people that should be
09:43 either pulled out of the medical
09:45 industry or pulled out a medical
09:47 industry and put in jail as well as the
09:49 companies selling us all the poison the
09:52 b-17 and vitamin C work together what
09:56 they do is they call C a catalyst to the
09:58 b-17 mechanism which means it's a helper
10:02 the best vitamin C you can get in the
10:06 world other than actual C injections and
10:09 you can be seventeen injections as well
10:12 I've never done it so I don't know
10:14 exactly where you would go to get such a
10:15 thing but salera
10:19 sol ARA why it's a white bottle with a
10:23 rainbow stripe across the top very tiny
10:25 rainbow stripe you get a thousand
10:27 milligram capsules that are marked time
10:30 release time releas capsules are awesome
10:32 you get 500 milligrams of a thousand
10:34 milligrams there's just a normal little
10:36 pill you take it it's a powdered capsule
10:39 which is great it then holds five
10:41 hundred over eight hours so for eight
10:44 hours you were getting basically a
10:46 thousand milligrams what's beautiful
10:48 about vitamin C is its non-toxic same
10:52 with b-17 you can take as much as you
10:54 want and it will mean within reason of
10:57 course but you can't OD on it and it
11:01 won't toxify your body if you happen to
11:03 take too much if you simply pass it out
11:05 of your your urine or the other part so
11:10 you'll be safe but what is this stuff
11:12 doing is this like some hocus-pocus junk
11:15 or someone's telling you put magnets
11:17 underneath your orange juice no it works
11:20 on a purely atomic level this is not
11:23 faith this is not wishful thinking this
11:26 is not folklore this stuff works and
11:29 it's the way that whoever designed this
11:31 universe
11:32 made sure that we had the ability to
11:35 heal ourselves on a daily basis by
11:38 eating fruits and vegetables that would
11:40 have vitamin C in it and of course b-17
11:43 out of the apricot pit although you have
11:46 to have those prepared before you eat
11:48 them because they have toxification
11:50 defense mechanism on them that Mother
11:53 Nature put in there now some of you may
11:56 have heard that you gain a lot of
11:57 bacteria in your body as you progress
12:00 from zero to ten they estimate anywhere
12:03 from 400 to 800 foreign strands of
12:07 bacteria will start living in your gut
12:08 and living inside your body
12:11 now you don't die because your immune
12:13 system is there to help out it's going
12:15 to rip apart these invaders and get them
12:17 out of your system but now imagine you
12:20 had some toxification which we're gonna
12:22 get all the techniques later if it
12:25 develops some sort of malignant cancer
12:28 some cancer that is on a roll it's not
12:31 being challenged enough and so it
12:32 continues to grow in the body and so you
12:35 need something to kill that but your
12:38 mune system is overwhelmed by all the
12:39 bacteria and other junk you might be
12:41 consuming and so it helps but it can't
12:44 quite help enough to get rid of the
12:46 cancer so what we do is we take these
12:49 two vitamins to get in there and help it
12:53 gets in there and destroys a ton of the
12:56 invaders if not all the invaders in your
12:58 body giving your immune system nothing
13:01 else to do but kill the cancer at the
13:04 same level you will actually have some
13:07 of the sea and b-17 will actually help
13:09 if it can get to the physical region of
13:11 the cancer it can actually help kill the
13:12 cancer as well as I understand it but
13:15 here's how this works you are made out
13:19 of a bunch of atoms that have a atomic
13:21 bonds that hold you together it's
13:24 dictated by protein patterns the till
13:26 chromosomes / DNA what to do the protein
13:30 patterns in your chromosomes as well but
13:32 it tells that what to do and then it
13:33 forms these bonds that make up who you
13:36 are as a human being the invaders in
13:39 your body don't have the amazing engine
13:42 that you have to be who you are
13:45 with the atomic bonds that you have and
13:47 so they're able to replicate themselves
13:49 by stealing nutrients out of your body
13:52 stealing you know various supplies to
13:55 create themselves but they're weaker
13:58 they're much weaker than your body so
14:02 imagine having a target in front of you
14:05 once made a cardboard ones made a Letten
14:07 and you have a 22 pistol in your hand
14:09 shoot the cardboard you know the bullets
14:11 going to go through the cardboard you
14:12 shoot the lead wall and you better get
14:14 out of the way because it's gonna
14:15 ricochet you are the lead the invaders
14:20 of the cardboard and what see and b-17
14:23 do is that they act like a radioactive
14:27 isotope
14:28 they are always shedding an electron as
14:31 they pass through your body now if they
14:33 hit the lead wall which is you what
14:35 happens it just bounces off there's no
14:37 problem you can take C and again it
14:39 won't hurt your body because it doesn't
14:40 have the atomic ability to hurt your
14:42 love but hurt your body but the invader
14:45 it's like salt on a snail it just shreds
14:48 it so here you have this all this
14:50 bacteria and you get you have all this
14:51 stuff in your body viruses perhaps might
14:54 be running roaming around your body and
14:55 this stuff gets in there and knocks its
14:58 lights out all right what does it have
15:02 to do with cancer your immune system now
15:05 is fully equipped it has no other
15:07 enemies taking up the majority of its
15:10 time it'll still do a little bit of that
15:13 stuff because it's everywhere and
15:14 through your bloodstream so if there's a
15:15 bacteria so it was going to be killing
15:17 and and and flushing out this this
15:19 bacteria but once it finds cancer it
15:22 goes after it and it kills it and you
15:27 win now there is a technique that I have
15:32 learned since my last recording which
15:35 I'm going to share with this technique
15:36 anytime you're taking a nutrient to get
15:39 rid of a particular invader like cancer
15:42 there's something called stacking now
15:46 remember what I said about the time
15:48 release vitamin C time release vitamin C
15:51 is actually extremely powerful
15:53 interesting because you can stack it now
15:56 we said 50% goes first so if I
15:59 milligrams are gonna go in your system
16:00 first then 500 is held over 8 hours now
16:05 imagine if you take too much vitamin C
16:07 like 3,000 or more depending on your
16:10 body weight you might only be 2 you can
16:12 get a little bit of an upset stomach if
16:14 you have an empty stomach for about 15
16:17 minutes it'll go away so if you can trip
16:21 through that then fine but if you just
16:22 eat a little bit need a small meal - a
16:24 big meal stacking is one way to avoid
16:28 any disruption to your to your stomach
16:32 so our one you can take 1000 milligrams
16:36 no if you eat a big meal you can take
16:39 five of these things in you you won't
16:41 have an upset stomach depending on your
16:43 getting your body weight now we're to
16:45 you take another thousand milligrams our
16:47 three our four the techniques I've heard
16:50 communicated by those that have rid
16:52 themselves with cancer using this
16:54 technique is for the first 36 hours they
16:57 will stack vitamin C they're gonna get
17:01 36 thousand milligrams of C into their
17:04 body it will utterly shocked all the
17:07 invaders it's as if they're the
17:09 reinforcements have shown up and your
17:11 immune systems like whew alright you get
17:14 rid of all these crowd you know the you
17:18 know these invaders and I'm gonna go
17:20 after this cancer b-17 can also be
17:25 stacked the same way and I've heard it
17:27 done 500 milligrams 500 milligrams now
17:30 after about 48 hours you can relax into
17:33 a normal regiment now in terms of the
17:36 dosage of the vitamin C you know I would
17:41 say you could probably take four to five
17:43 thousand milligrams a day along with
17:46 your thousand milligrams of b-17 and you
17:49 will really have your body humming
17:51 really well now we're going to get into
17:54 other things you need to do right away
17:55 after this first treatment but I want to
17:57 get this one in your in your ear as
17:59 quickly as possible so you'll hang on
18:01 again
18:04 b-17 sheds an electron see sheds an
18:08 electron as I have been told b-17s
18:12 atomic power when it sheds an electron
18:16 is slightly more powerful than when a/c
18:19 sheds an electron so it has the ability
18:21 to start shedding our start shredding
18:24 excuse me
18:24 cancerous cells as it moves throughout
18:26 your body it's not hocus-pocus it's pure
18:30 physics it's pure chemistry in your body
18:34 now how do we make cancer starve to
18:39 death again if you visited an oncologist
18:42 by any stretch you will know this
18:44 already so the only thing you don't know
18:45 is what I gave you in terms of this
18:47 treatment now we're going to get into
18:49 the skepticism that will be handed down
18:50 by khara oncologists because we're
18:53 encroaching on their territory of
18:55 extreme lucrative money you are nothing
18:59 but a paycheck to them and when you walk
19:01 you in with cancer they they go home
19:03 with Glee in their heart that they're
19:05 gonna pay for a new jet ski a new house
19:08 a new car they're gonna milk you dry the
19:12 only other doctor you're running into is
19:13 someone who's too ignorant to look at
19:16 these techniques and acknowledge them
19:18 they're sort of a robot that memorizes
19:20 and repeats things which is the worst
19:23 kind of doctor you could possibly get
19:24 because they can get indoctrinated
19:26 instantaneously the wall b-17 and C are
19:31 circulating through your system and
19:32 helping your immune system fight
19:34 absolutely everything in your body and
19:36 that's the nice thing it fights
19:37 everything in your body okay and again
19:39 if you're doubting this this technique
19:42 go ahead and get your chemotherapy at
19:44 the same time but I'll warn you there's
19:47 been countless videos online of people
19:49 who've used this treatment to cure their
19:51 cancer they got cured of cancer but
19:53 because the chemotherapy is running
19:55 through their body rampid they had to
19:57 stay on the b-17 for ten more years to
20:01 make sure that the isotope in their body
20:02 doesn't manifest more cancer and kill
20:05 them isotopes tend to hide in all the
20:09 nooks and crannies in your body why did
20:10 we take iodine pills and we fear a
20:12 nuclear attack because iodine goes into
20:15 all those little nooks and crannies in
20:17 your bones and your muscles and your
20:18 tissue and essentially fills up the spot
20:21 so that when a radioactive isotope
20:23 coming out of the sky some nuclear
20:26 winter thing happens and if you
20:28 accidentally ingest it the iodine is
20:30 already taking up the room and says
20:32 there's no more room in here for you you
20:34 keep going until it falls out of your
20:35 body through your waste product
20:37 that's why iodine is taken okay but the
20:41 two things the cancer loves in your body
20:43 you know the two things that it consumes
20:45 to survive is sugar and meat it's all
20:50 meats but you know because red meat is
20:53 such a powerful dietary additive to the
20:56 human body it improves your eyesight
20:58 bruise your brain acuity keeps your skin
21:01 nice and smooth and and you know don't
21:04 abuse it but it's a it's the building
21:07 block that we live off of five out of
21:09 the eight amino acids that we create our
21:13 body out of comes out of red meat and no
21:15 other meat so cancer knows this and it
21:18 does it consumes it so gonna have to cut
21:21 that off until we're done until you are
21:24 given a clean bill of health
21:26 sugar well sugar is the building block
21:29 of life sugar comes in two forms though
21:31 and so you have to be very cognitive of
21:34 where and when you're ingesting a sugar
21:37 some of you may know that carbohydrates
21:39 are complex sugars so you have to be
21:43 careful with carbon out during a cancer
21:45 treatment you are providing a complex
21:47 sugar which is the very first thing that
21:49 the body breaks down because it always
21:52 goes for the hardest thing first the
21:54 second thing it tries to break down is
21:55 sugar third thing it tries to break down
21:57 is fat the reason why people get very
22:00 fat when they eat too much of all this
22:02 stuff together is that the body only has
22:04 a fixed amount of energy to do all this
22:06 work and so if it if it runs out of
22:09 energy before it gets done with this
22:10 gigantic meal you have consumed
22:12 everything else gets stored up to be
22:15 used later on now there's a myth the
22:18 sugar is a fat and fat as a sugar the
22:21 sugar could ever turn into fat that's
22:23 like oil turning into water or water
22:25 turning into oil they do not turn into
22:28 each other sugars can store themselves
22:30 inside fat cells but one does not become
22:33 the other so please don't ever repeat
22:35 that to somebody unless you remove all
22:37 doubts you have no knowledge of what
22:38 you're talking about
22:39 so the second technique I'm going to
22:42 tell you is probably the most popular
22:46 technique in in non-american countries
22:50 to fight this and this is what I have
22:52 personally witnessed billionaires using
22:55 on their kids to cure cancer and it's
22:58 almost as if when you catch this you
23:00 come down with cancer the people in the
23:03 know and there's a lot of rich people
23:03 that believe their oncologist and their
23:06 very official story type people and so
23:07 they don't know these techniques you
23:08 might say well if everybody knew this
23:10 then nobody out of cancer believe me you
23:13 can sit and argue with a billionaire
23:14 about anything you'd argue with your
23:17 weird uncle about you know they're
23:19 stubborn in their ways that's how they
23:21 became rich so don't think that they
23:22 have intelligence simply because they
23:24 have a big bank account sadly those have
23:27 nothing to do with each other but a very
23:30 very wealthy man that my girlfriend
23:33 worked for his daughter came down with
23:34 cancer at 29 he sent her to Mexico to
23:37 get this technique and she came back six
23:40 months fully cured never took a drop of
23:42 chemotherapy now let's let me pause for
23:47 one second and let's go over
23:49 chemotherapy as I understand at the last
23:52 revision to the patent of chemotherapy
23:54 happened in 1989 chemotherapy in my
23:57 opinion is the most draconian technique
23:59 of curing cancer on planet Earth it is
24:01 tenth amount to putting leeches all over
24:03 your body
24:03 we will look at this in a hundred years
24:05 and and laugh like we look at cigarette
24:09 ads you know that we're told pregnant
24:11 women if you don't want a big baby smoke
24:14 cigarettes you know cigarettes are
24:16 healthy for you and all that other stuff
24:17 right again a cigar you ain't cigarette
24:19 cigarette so you'll just have to go
24:23 watch one of my cigar episodes to know
24:24 about why I smoke these oncology is I
24:28 understand it as well as the only
24:29 division of medicine where the doctor
24:32 gets a kickback meaning a money reward
24:34 for prescribing chemotherapy to you all
24:39 other pharmaceuticals have been banned
24:41 in terms of kickbacks the United States
24:43 at least so doctors don't prescribe
24:45 things to you at least to get a kickback
24:49 they might have been paid off behind the
24:50 scenes they get a car and
24:52 imagine Mercedes gets parked outside the
24:54 clinic and the keys get given to the
24:56 doctor and this is from cipro cipro
24:59 antibiotic do we just wanted to say
25:01 thank you for being a great doctor and
25:02 now the guys like really I'll guess I'll
25:05 recommend a lot of cipro maybe another
25:07 call show up for my daughter next year
25:10 you see how that works but chemotherapy
25:12 is an aboveboard kickback scheme that
25:15 essentially provides a motive for a
25:18 doctor to have no ethics when it comes
25:21 to treating you so if you think these
25:24 people are for you you're nuts the
25:26 people that sold you the cancer is food
25:28 and the cancer is whatever objects
25:32 cellphones and all that other kind of
25:34 stuff which we're gonna get into all
25:35 that after the cures it's the same
25:38 ethics that run the pharmaceutical
25:40 companies run the medical industry there
25:43 is no ethical corporation in existence
25:46 so spare everyone this diatribe that you
25:52 know there are people that really want
25:54 to fight cancer out there yeah maybe
25:56 your nurse that doesn't know what's
25:57 going on or your doctor that doesn't
25:59 know why everything that they tried
26:00 doesn't work and it loses all of his
26:01 patients but this neck tech next
26:05 technique is so powerful it was invented
26:08 in 1905 where dr. Gerson GE RSO in that
26:15 about I think it's about 15 to 20 years
26:18 ago in Fukushima Japan prior to the 2011
26:23 you know earthquake problem Fukushima
26:28 was the number one cancer treating
26:29 center in Japan and it used nothing but
26:32 Gershom technique eventually now they
26:36 were a normal oncology
26:38 Hospital but then the hospital
26:40 administrator got cancer and nothing was
26:43 working
26:44 he tried Gershom technique on himself
26:46 fully went into remission killed the
26:50 cancer it was quick it was easy and it
26:52 was painless and so he went as the story
26:54 goes there's a documentary about this
26:56 summer online I think it was on Netflix
26:58 for a while he went to the hospital
27:00 administrators the owners the government
27:02 said look I want to make this a Gershom
27:04 Center
27:06 they agreed and I believe he was in the
27:09 lower 80 percent cure rate
27:12 instantaneously now of course there are
27:15 people that come in too late there are
27:17 people that don't follow the regiment so
27:19 the other maybe 15 plus percent people
27:22 could be coming in too late they still
27:25 eat their meats and sugars cuz they
27:26 can't stop they don't take the medicine
27:28 on time and so you will always have a
27:31 group of people that don't get cured
27:33 it's not been my experience with the
27:35 people that I have given this stuff to
27:38 again i've harvest this from a hundred
27:42 different sources with as many
27:45 testimonies as possible and i'm gonna
27:47 tell you some things that have been
27:49 suggested as treatments that i have no
27:52 knowledge of anyone ever using ever and
27:54 i'll make that very clear to you guys
27:55 but here's how the Gershon technique
27:57 works you cut out fats IRA so you come
28:01 out sugars and meats right away boom
28:03 that's always gonna be the case no
28:04 matter what you're doing you cannot feed
28:06 the cancer what it uses to manifest so
28:10 we starve it right away it's a beautiful
28:13 thing but you got to eat something right
28:15 so what do you eat most of you will have
28:18 a sugar you know a sweet tooth and
28:20 you'll have a savory tooth a salt tooth
28:22 right our body just kind of wants that
28:25 as it goes throughout the day so what's
28:27 cool about the Gershon technique and
28:28 again you can mix the previous vitamin C
28:30 and b-17 technique with the Gershon
28:33 technique you can either take the grim
28:35 technique all the way to the way it was
28:36 designed to be used or you can do two
28:39 thirds of it and I'm gonna explain them
28:42 what dr. Gershman figured out where's
28:45 that cruciferous vegetables are
28:47 extremely powerful and augmenting the
28:50 immune system to fight cancer what our
28:54 cursor verse vegetables where your
28:55 quicklist is broccoli cauliflower
28:57 carrots and asparagus what's beautiful
29:01 about that is that you have three fairly
29:04 savory vegetables that you can eat all
29:07 day long you can eat them raw you can
29:09 either lightly steamed don't steam them
29:11 too much because you'll absolutely
29:12 neutralize their nutritional value as
29:14 raw as you can get it do it but it's
29:16 just a light steam to put a little bit
29:18 of
29:18 you know sweat haze on them it's usually
29:20 how Americans eat it try not to put too
29:24 much cheese and junk on it a little bit
29:27 of salt maybe top top it out but the
29:30 beautiful thing about carrots is that if
29:33 you grind up carrots and make carrot
29:35 juice you will have the sweetest drink
29:38 you've ever had in your life it's so
29:40 addictive
29:41 I personally got addicted to carrot
29:43 juice before I knew any of this was a
29:44 treatment Steve Jobs was rumored as
29:47 being a gigantic carrot juice a Holika
29:50 to the point his skin actually got a
29:51 haze of orange it's very interesting
29:55 most of the Gershom technique clinics
29:58 that I have witnessed in videos where
30:01 they fully document the whole clinic
30:03 they they do this a technique the skirts
30:05 from technique a hundred percent with
30:06 just carrots now of course you don't
30:09 want to get GMO carrots or GMO anything
30:11 right we got organic organic organic
30:14 demanded because you do not want to
30:16 ingest cancerous glyphosate and its
30:20 counterparts at the same time you're
30:22 trying to cure cancer right now the
30:25 second part of the Gershon technique and
30:28 there's if you think if it says three
30:29 parts really get rid of sugars and meats
30:31 eat these cruciferous vegetables and
30:35 again the nice thing about a pureed
30:37 carrot juice is that it's fairly girthy
30:41 it's beautiful
30:42 if you do it right it tastes like silk
30:44 it's the most amazing thing you've ever
30:45 eaten it's got a nice sweet taste to it
30:48 some of you love vegetables just go for
30:50 it any one of those for vegetables just
30:52 tore it just rotate through it all week
30:54 all day whatever will you get tired of
30:56 it yeah probably but then cancer stinks
30:58 right but the last stage of Gershom is
31:03 the more it's tougher for people to get
31:09 into but again once you look at
31:11 chemotherapy this last step is not going
31:14 to seem like a problem at all and it's
31:15 actually from what I understand
31:17 extremely pleasant and addictive which
31:19 is to give yourself a room-temperature
31:22 enema of coffee when I first heard that
31:26 I was like what the reason why they want
31:30 you to do this this enema
31:32 is that it will stimulate the bowels of
31:35 your body because where does an enema go
31:36 goes into your lower bowel room
31:39 temperature you won't have any problem
31:40 with heat you won't burn yourself or
31:42 anything like that won't be cold if what
31:45 I understand you barely feel it but the
31:48 other thing that happens is you actually
31:49 get high you actually get like super you
31:53 know jazzed out with all the caffeine
31:55 but what it's doing is it's taking the
31:57 upper intestine the entire intestinal
31:59 line so here comes all these cruciferous
32:01 vegetables down your system it's going
32:03 to pass through your esophagus go into
32:04 your stomach and eventually release into
32:06 your upper intestine your upper
32:08 intestine is a very special place it has
32:10 little follicles in it that absorb all
32:12 the nutrients into the body when you do
32:15 the enema shortly after doing the
32:17 gestation of your cruciferous vegetables
32:21 you then stimulate multiple of what you
32:26 would normally ingest and then it goes
32:30 to work inside your body now from what I
32:33 understand about this particular
32:35 technique is that the cruciferous
32:36 vegetables when broken down supercharge
32:40 your immune system 100% they themselves
32:43 do not fight the cancer but it feeds the
32:47 system in your body that goes and just
32:49 rips everything apart so it's
32:51 essentially like taking a normal human
32:54 being and turning them into Superman and
32:55 say now you can jump over a building in
32:57 a single bound
32:58 so that's what happens to your immune
32:59 system when you ingest all of this car
33:02 service vegetable matter now of course
33:06 you need a technique to go in and check
33:08 your cancer you need you know some
33:09 people have lumps they can just feel
33:11 them and go wow this stuff's going down
33:14 we have at least two individuals for the
33:17 previous video comments where they came
33:18 in and said I use the vitamin C b-17
33:21 technique I had these lumps I was
33:23 diagnosed with this and it went away
33:25 thank you very much that's how fast it
33:28 is they could watch the video try the
33:29 technique get cured and come back and
33:32 posts I mean when do you get an option
33:34 like that in life right now again I want
33:38 to say that one of the b-17 stories we
33:40 had they didn't know anything about the
33:43 C catalyst the C edition
33:46 and all they were doing is taking b-17
33:48 injections they were given a bottle just
33:50 like insulin and they were doing their
33:52 shots to themselves and I don't know the
33:55 dosage you definitely want to talk to a
33:57 doctor about that because your body
33:59 weight and fat density will determine
34:01 how much you get of any drug in this
34:03 world that's why when they put fluoride
34:05 in our water it's insane because a five
34:09 foot woman should not be taking the same
34:11 dosage as a six foot four man right and
34:14 a 100 pound person gets a different dose
34:17 than a 280 pound person in most cases
34:20 okay but at this gentleman is a friend
34:24 of my previous co-host my other show
34:27 MKULTRA radio he was a special effects
34:30 guy he still listed this day
34:32 he was given they said stage three and a
34:34 half was sort of highly estimated his
34:37 cancer growth he used b-17 fully cured
34:40 in like three and a half months and his
34:42 cats of eight years was diagnosed with
34:45 cancer probably do some bad food or
34:48 whatever and he ended up just going he
34:50 had some of his b-17 left and so he just
34:52 injected it in the gums of his cats and
34:56 the cat lived another well by the time
34:59 we were talking about it it led to
35:00 another four years and was still healthy
35:04 so just keep all that in the back of
35:06 your head in terms of the techniques but
35:09 you you will never absorb something
35:10 better than an injection you won't so
35:13 it's better than eating it it's better
35:15 in taking a pill so if you can get
35:17 injections go for it there is another
35:21 technique that was supposedly used by
35:25 Ronald Reagan in the late 80s because he
35:27 came down with colon cancer this is sort
35:30 of exciting for any type of cancer that
35:33 is essentially below the neck now I'm
35:37 gonna say this technique and you might
35:39 have a knee-jerk reaction because
35:40 there's an old rule that we have about
35:44 this condition that we don't want to
35:45 ever get our body in this particular
35:47 state but there's a catch so don't you
35:49 know don't totally run away from this
35:50 whole thing the technique is to raise
35:53 the body temperature 206 for 15 minutes
35:59 as I've heard it communicated to me this
36:01 technique only needs to be done once a
36:03 week if that's how powerful it is I mean
36:08 geez
36:09 if you didn't die of it I would say do
36:12 it twice a week but usually the rule is
36:15 if a person catches a virus and the
36:17 virus drives up the body heat to 106 you
36:22 rush that person to the hospital you put
36:24 them in a bath of cool water you got to
36:26 get the temperature down because you can
36:28 start getting brain damage and you could
36:29 die
36:29 so there's a big there's a big bunch of
36:33 rules about 106 fevers we are not
36:38 talking about a renegade virus in the
36:40 body we're talking about a control
36:42 condition now I've heard it done the
36:45 formal way that you do this and I don't
36:47 believe this is something that the
36:49 United States even has a clinic for but
36:51 if you look at the way third-world
36:53 countries use this technique there's a
36:55 bunch of ways you can do this but you
36:57 obviously need to have the subject get
36:59 into a a bed or a table with a heating
37:03 blanket underneath and a heating blanket
37:05 on top plus other blankets on top of
37:07 that you do not cover up the head
37:09 whatsoever you obviously have to have a
37:12 thermostat so you're gonna have to have
37:14 a thermometer that can measure the blood
37:18 temperature you need to understand when
37:21 you're at a hundred and six and start
37:23 counting off now this is under
37:26 supervision so you have people around
37:27 that person if they would ever feel you
37:30 know dizzy or whatever you can abort the
37:33 situation and you know try it an n
37:37 different technique to the point someone
37:39 feels comfortable but usually 15 minutes
37:41 of 106 person is gonna be fine I've had
37:43 106 for a couple hours once and I was
37:45 just fine but Chad you heat them up and
37:48 it pounds the cancer why there's a week
37:52 delay between doing it again my only my
37:55 only thought is that it must neutralize
37:58 and again disrupt the atomic bonds of
38:03 the cancer and then the week is to allow
38:05 the immune system to get in there and
38:06 flush it out I mean my suggestion would
38:09 be to have water available all that kind
38:11 of stuff probably room tip
38:12 your water don't be slamming some you
38:15 know 35 degree water so the lot of folks
38:19 that you shouldn't drink cold beverages
38:20 and usually it's the richest people in
38:22 the world say that so let's borrow from
38:24 their handbook because it doesn't hurt
38:25 too bad to drink room temperature water
38:28 so 106 for 15 minutes is good for
38:31 cancers below the neck now does your
38:34 brain get the same sort of heat
38:36 absolutely but this is the technique
38:39 it's called thermal treatment now one of
38:43 the other techniques that I have never
38:44 heard of a single person being cured of
38:46 although the claims online are very
38:49 intense is hemp oil hemp oil is
38:55 essentially extremely concentrated THC
38:58 from marijuana the I've seen many videos
39:01 about how people create it I don't know
39:04 if I'd personally ever try to create it
39:05 myself but they tried to make hemp oil
39:07 super illegal for instance I believe it
39:11 is well we know it's legal to buy
39:12 marijuana in Colorado but if you get
39:14 caught with hemp oil you can go to jail
39:16 for 15 20 years because you're
39:19 disrupting the oncology trillion-dollar
39:22 business all right
39:24 but the dosages I would I would defer
39:28 you to anyone who I would say avoid this
39:31 technique unless you can find someone
39:33 who's got case studies with this kind of
39:35 thing right but you buy these little
39:38 black tea turns black when you turn it
39:39 into hemp oil and essentially you're
39:41 stirring and sifting the I forgot what
39:46 they call up the the actual crystals in
39:48 the THC you have to freeze it crush it
39:51 sift it crush it sift it crush it to get
39:54 this stuff and then you put it in a
39:55 container and they heat it up
39:58 usually in like a some type of burner
40:00 that would normally heat up your coffee
40:01 or something and then they just keep
40:04 stirring it and stirring it turns into a
40:06 black substance and then they pull it
40:07 into these syringes plastic syringes and
40:10 you buy it in syringes and you just
40:11 squeeze a little bit out put it on your
40:13 tongue and they're gonna know the
40:15 dosages I don't know the dosages about
40:17 that so again hemp oils out there as a
40:19 potential cure supposedly I have never
40:22 heard of a singer' single sole being
40:24 cured of it but I've heard countless
40:25 article
40:26 I've read countless articles excuse me
40:28 people claiming this I don't have anyone
40:30 personally in my life there's it's three
40:34 and a half people I would say we've done
40:36 the vitamin C b-17 I say half because
40:38 when I was a distant friend of mine the
40:41 second degree third degree person excuse
40:43 me the other ones were first degrees
40:47 Gershom technique again the girl that
40:50 came back from Mexico fully cured after
40:53 six months boom
40:55 it's good stuff thermal technique
40:57 there's a whole article I read about
41:01 President Reagan taking this to cure his
41:04 colon cancer hemp oil I don't know now
41:09 there's another technique and I
41:10 apologize the the doctors name eludes me
41:14 because it's a foreign name but he does
41:16 a urine treatment where he takes your
41:19 urine treats it and ejects it back into
41:22 your body and he has been sued 36 times
41:25 at least by the oncology hospitals of
41:29 the world and he's won out every single
41:31 time in court he wins because he takes
41:35 his case studies in and proves that he
41:36 can cure cancer just look look up cancer
41:40 treatment urine and look it up of course
41:44 if you find articles that have been paid
41:46 for by these oncology departments then
41:48 you're gonna read a bunch of this stuff
41:49 doesn't work again the guy's been sued a
41:51 bunch of times and you want a bunch of
41:53 times so definitely take a look at that
41:54 it's so effective that you just you do
41:57 have to have compatible urine but they
41:59 said that you know you could pull five
42:01 people off the street and one of these
42:03 five people are gonna be compatible with
42:05 your body so there's everybody pees so
42:08 it's a is a pretty decent regimen of
42:10 supplies and ingredients to create this
42:12 technique I don't know about the
42:14 technique because he won't publish the
42:15 technique I don't know how it works
42:17 because that's all sort of his miracle
42:19 which is why he's trying to make money
42:21 off the situation it does bother me that
42:24 people try to make profit to the point
42:26 where you know the rest of the world is
42:28 not getting it instead of just
42:29 publishing his papers and saying okay
42:32 you know if you want rewards in this
42:34 world for creating great things you
42:36 narrowly shortsightedness as money
42:39 well then why don't you try walking
42:40 around the world when you've cured
42:41 everybody of their cancer you're gonna
42:43 get a meal paid for a cart tank full of
42:46 gas I mean you're gonna be fine and
42:47 wherever you go right I mean would you
42:50 buy someone a cruise if they could carry
42:52 your either you or your loved ones of
42:54 cancer sure you would so don't hold on
42:59 to techniques if you got them that's my
43:00 opinion so those are the primary
43:03 solutions you can use to get this thing
43:06 happening I doubt you need to go past
43:08 the first one but it just depends just
43:10 depends on what you're willing to
43:11 experiment again these techniques have
43:15 been proven the sides the hemp oil I
43:18 don't have any personal proof of that
43:20 but these other techniques Thermal
43:23 vitamin C b-17 regiment and guram
43:25 technique have all been proven to work
43:28 the urine guy he's got his case studies
43:32 he can't win in court against these
43:34 folks if they don't work now let's talk
43:38 about how we catch cancer because there
43:41 are giant myths about how you catch
43:43 cancer okay now the the true reality of
43:48 the situation is that a combination of
43:51 things usually creates cancer altogether
43:57 there was this movie made 1989 called
44:00 Batman by Tim Burton and one of the
44:03 plots in that movie was all about the
44:06 the villain putting a bunch of poisons
44:09 and all of our food supply our shampoos
44:11 makeups all this other stuff and so the
44:13 joke in the movie was that everyone
44:14 showed up looking really Haggard to the
44:17 news agencies that was sort of
44:21 predictive programming that's exactly
44:23 what happens with a lot of the stuff
44:25 that we put on our bodies a lot of stuff
44:27 that we ingest and so you need to if you
44:33 don't have cancer you're just watching
44:35 this out of pure curiosity these are
44:36 things that I think you should do
44:38 immediately to prevent yourself and your
44:41 family members from catching cancer in
44:44 the first place now again with the cures
44:47 out there the overall anxiety about
44:51 catching cancer can go
44:53 but believe me you don't want to be in
44:55 any one of these regiments for you know
44:58 four to six months not going to work not
45:00 feeling well obviously this stuff will
45:03 actually make you feel bad but you know
45:05 it depends on how your cancer comes on
45:06 maybe the reason why you went to find
45:09 out that you had cancer is you don't
45:10 feel well anymore so you're not gonna
45:12 feel well as long as this stuff's still
45:13 in your body there are so many things
45:16 that cause cancer it's ridiculous but
45:18 there are so many things that don't
45:19 cause cancer that have been demonized
45:23 and once you remove them from your body
45:27 you think it's sick let's talk about the
45:30 Sun because the Sun gets a lot of bad
45:33 rep they try to tell you to stay out of
45:38 the Sun all the time don't think and
45:39 what's interesting about people with
45:41 those heavy regiments is they tend to
45:43 get cancer and die there's something
45:46 called the pituitary gland that lives
45:47 just inside your temple of your head
45:49 there's one on each side of your body
45:51 and it manufactures something very very
45:53 important called vitamin D there are
45:56 vitamin DS pills out there but I would
45:58 see if you had a regimen of buying them
46:00 and taking them stop buying them stop
46:02 taking them and get out there and get at
46:03 least an hour of Sun on your face while
46:06 on your face because that's where your
46:07 pituitary gland lives now believe it or
46:10 not on a subatomic level you don't need
46:12 to know the details the sun rays go
46:15 through your head and stimulate that
46:17 pineal gland are sorry that pituitary
46:18 gland and manufacturer vitamin D vitamin
46:21 D is so important to stay healthy that
46:24 four regions of the world where people
46:26 live in the dark for six months out of
46:28 the year
46:29 upper northern Russia they take their
46:32 children and their adults and they have
46:33 tanning machines that they put on such
46:36 that people get sunlight on their face
46:39 which will stimulate just like the Sun
46:42 the vitamin D that keeps them healthy
46:44 but what's the theory of Sun creating
46:48 cancer now I come from the Midwest I
46:50 come from Kansas and middle of America
46:52 well we are called rednecks because we
46:54 are out in the Sun the second it comes
46:56 up and we're usually awake working about
46:59 an hour after it goes down we're called
47:02 rednecks because we get tanned and
47:04 burned
47:05 constantly all throughout the day these
47:08 farmers are not dropping dead of
47:11 melanomas and skin cancers one they
47:14 don't put a bunch of crap in their body
47:16 because they usually eat fairly organic
47:17 because they're usually related to
47:18 creating the food that they ingest
47:20 including the milk that they ingest but
47:24 the theory is the photon is a bullet the
47:28 photon in terms of cancer conversations
47:31 is more of a particle than a wave so
47:34 don't worry about it but just imagine it
47:35 as a bullet and let's say you had a
47:37 chromosome in your body inside of a cell
47:41 and in there are nucleic acid chains
47:44 which we call DNA now DNA is made out of
47:48 AC TG that's the way we designate the
47:52 amino acids there's not a whole lot of
47:55 things in there in terms of its its
47:58 various species now let's say that you
48:02 take a strand of DNA and you cut it in
48:04 half what'll happen half the time and
48:07 you cut it in half with a photon half
48:10 the time that DNA becomes and because
48:13 you know it's only allowed to connect to
48:15 one of its counterparts it'll connect
48:18 beautifully now if it gets horribly
48:20 shattered and horribly injured then the
48:22 immune system will grab it and take it
48:24 out of the body but now you take that
48:26 DNA chain and you hit it twice what
48:29 happens when you hit a single strand of
48:31 something twice you get three pieces now
48:35 you run the risk of that center piece
48:37 rotating and reconnecting with the other
48:40 two and you have a mutated DNA strand
48:44 which then will create mutated flesh in
48:46 the body the instructions will be wrong
48:48 this is where you start to get clumps of
48:51 stuff in your body so that's the theory
48:55 once dermatology became a business we
48:59 had this index of cancerous cells take a
49:03 cell off a human body and you you
49:05 basically run it through this list of
49:08 like severity right okay well this looks
49:10 like it potentially could be a cancer or
49:12 so or this is a cancer so it's a lightly
49:15 cancer so it's a super cancer so this is
49:17 malignant this is benign is
49:19 meaning this grows rapidly and this will
49:23 just grow into a little ball and you
49:24 could just cut it out in it's no problem
49:27 so what do they do they tell you to wear
49:29 sunscreen go back to your Batman 89
49:32 sunscreen when hit by the Sun will turn
49:36 into a carcinogenic it's not good for
49:38 you
49:39 now they'll deny that by putting a bunch
49:42 of chemistry all over your flesh to stay
49:45 healthy should immediately seem insane
49:48 it should should you be outside in some
49:52 environment that's super duper hot
49:54 you're at a lake that's 114 degrees and
49:56 should you be out there in the Sun all
49:59 day in an 8 hour period probably not
50:01 farmers don't go out there with their
50:04 entire bodies naked they're not in
50:06 swimsuits they wear shirts up to their
50:08 necks they wear cowboy hats they get a
50:11 little bit of Sun here and there their
50:12 hands get it a lot of times they wear
50:14 gloves so they're not completely stupid
50:17 about overexposure of the Sun a lot of
50:20 them get inside farm machinery as long
50:23 as you're behind glass you will not get
50:25 the Rays that give you a suntan
50:26 any of you've traveled a long distance
50:28 in a car with the window down your arm
50:30 out the window this arm is beet red and
50:33 this arm is fine and your face is fine
50:35 even though you've had Sun coming
50:37 through the windshield in the other
50:38 window and the passenger had their
50:39 window up the whole time with their arm
50:41 on the window their arm isn't red so
50:44 glass is a nice way to get natural
50:46 protection if you're traveling from A to
50:48 B just keep that in mind speaking of
50:51 bullets hitting DNA what's another
50:54 property of the universe that provides
50:56 that function radioactive materials
51:02 Madame Curie the female that discovered
51:05 the principles of radiation using
51:08 uranium bars
51:09 she had an experiment going where she
51:12 was using uranium bars and trying to
51:15 figure out you know why these things are
51:16 warm why it's super-heavy and she had a
51:20 this is how the romantic story goes she
51:23 had a desk full of film and she on one
51:26 day going home she put a uranium bar on
51:28 top of this sealed thing of unexposed
51:31 film
51:32 then she goes home she comes back they
51:34 used the film for developing and all of
51:37 a sudden there's a big overexposed spot
51:39 right in the center of the film in the
51:41 shape of the bar and that let them know
51:43 oh my god something's coming off this
51:45 bar that is exposing this film and they
51:47 found out that it's radiation now most
51:50 of us don't have uranium bars anywhere
51:52 in our house the radiation comes from a
51:54 lot of different places doesn't it our
51:57 number one source of electromagnetic
51:59 radiation is electronics anytime you
52:03 have electricity going down a wire
52:06 whether it be on a PC board or in a wire
52:11 that's you know up around your house
52:13 there's a field around it of
52:16 electromagnetism okay most of us are far
52:21 enough away from all these wires and the
52:23 amplitude meaning how much electricity
52:25 is flowing over it at a particular unit
52:27 of time is so light that it's not a big
52:29 problem for us but then you do get some
52:33 neighborhoods that are surrounded by
52:34 these giants you know power lines that
52:39 are coming straight from the power
52:40 company and they're distributing giant
52:42 heavy lines of massive power through the
52:45 neighborhoods most people don't like to
52:47 buy homes by these things and that
52:48 distributes down and again the amplitude
52:50 starts to slow down because electricity
52:53 flows like water the pipe is small less
52:55 water pipe is huge bunch of water it's a
52:59 general theory of it so there's been a
53:02 lot of reports over the decades of
53:05 electron poisoning from these power
53:08 lines but there's also a tremendous
53:11 amount of components in your house that
53:13 have this pole how many people in a
53:17 colder region of the world use heating
53:20 blankets in their beds well if you ever
53:23 felt a heating blanket you can feel the
53:25 coil wires going up and down up and down
53:27 the blanket that's how it warms you
53:28 using electricity well you are sleeping
53:32 right on top of those poles I mean
53:34 they're the sheets on top of you and
53:36 it's warming you now for those of you in
53:38 those cold regions you really don't want
53:39 to hear that your heating blanket might
53:41 be sort of poisoning your body now I've
53:44 had plenty of plenty of friends of mine
53:46 my own family I've used them for years
53:48 and I survived and they survived and no
53:50 one died of cancer so you just need to
53:52 put that in your quiver of how much am i
53:54 how much am i exposing myself to
53:56 cancerous techniques that then my immune
54:00 system has to fight if you have cancer
54:02 you probably don't want to use one of
54:04 these things if you have some sort of
54:08 genetic weakness towards something else
54:11 you're ingesting so your family has a
54:13 history of cancer and it's usually
54:14 something dietary then you don't want to
54:17 add another equation to it to up your
54:20 likelihood of catching something like
54:22 cancer now the other big one is antennas
54:25 wireless technology and most importantly
54:29 your cell phone women that store cell
54:32 phones and their breasts and their tank
54:35 tops or whatever they're catching breast
54:38 cancer and they don't even know it the
54:42 manuals inside cellphones tell you that
54:44 you should keep a cell phone
54:45 three-quarters of an inch away from your
54:47 body the truth is you should probably
54:49 keep it as far away from your body as
54:51 you possibly can and use some sort of
54:52 earbud or Wireless our usual to your
54:55 wired headset that's what I use because
54:57 it has the lowest level of electricity
54:59 going through it to give me the crisp
55:01 perfect signal I never lose connection
55:04 with my wired headset but the buds do
55:07 lose connection bluetooth is one of the
55:09 worst technologies on planet Earth
55:11 irrespective of anything relating to the
55:13 cancer conversation now the other thing
55:16 a cell phone does is that when it's
55:17 trying to pick up a signal it's creating
55:20 an electromagnetic field around the
55:22 telephone and usually people get
55:25 salivary cancer here in their jaw
55:27 because they're holding it up to their
55:28 phone they'll get tumors behind their
55:30 ears it essentially boils the
55:32 mitochondria inside your cell and that's
55:35 all of the sort of filler and yourself
55:38 and when it boils on an atomic level
55:42 it's just shaking apart everything what
55:45 is what is the atomic signature of
55:47 something hot the atoms are moving in a
55:48 very excited fashion what is the atomic
55:51 signature something cold they're very
55:52 still and so we boil things to break
55:57 things down ask any sous-chef you know
55:59 that's getting MasterChef that's what we
56:01 do we reduce things right
56:04 imagine reducing your cellular tissue
56:07 creating an absolutely corrupted cell
56:09 again probably 99 times out of 100 if
56:12 not 10 times that amount or 200 times
56:14 that are a thousand times that amount
56:15 your immune systems gonna grab that cell
56:17 get rid of it I have a third degree
56:22 friend who went in to get tumors removed
56:25 from right behind her ear and she was
56:29 related to a very famous actress Academy
56:33 award-winning actress so they got good
56:35 doctors that didn't blow smoke up their
56:37 rear end again famous people can get
56:39 doctors that really know everything I'm
56:41 telling you and they laugh it off that
56:43 anyone would go to an oncology clinic to
56:44 get things repaired but the other tumors
56:46 removed and in the recovery room they
56:50 did this little follow-up visit the same
56:52 day and they asked the doctor well how
56:54 did she get these tumors and he says
56:57 make a phone call they said what well
57:00 just pretend you're making a phone call
57:02 so she holds the phone to her head and
57:04 he goes that's exactly how you got it
57:07 you're holding that thing up to your ear
57:09 this is what causes this some people
57:11 more susceptible than others maybe your
57:13 immune system is compromised by a bunch
57:15 of things you're eating bunch of other
57:16 exposures that you have so POW they were
57:21 told exactly how to keep that from
57:22 happening
57:24 more reasons why fluoride fluoride is
57:29 the byproduct of making aluminum yes it
57:31 does occur in nature naturally but it
57:33 occurs at like one millionth if not one
57:35 billionth of the level that occurs in
57:38 your toothpaste and you're drinking
57:40 water if it's fluoridated and you're
57:43 like black teas naturally have some
57:46 fluoride in them but again it's my nude
57:47 if you just use natural products and you
57:49 never add this other stuff to it
57:53 fluoride is responsible for tooth decay
57:57 it is responsible for osteoporosis it's
58:00 not the only reason why you get
58:01 osteoporosis but it's a big reason why
58:03 you get it
58:04 and it also crystallizes inside your
58:07 pineal gland which is the little gland
58:09 that sits right underneath the center of
58:11 your brain it's your third eye it's
58:12 where you
58:13 become empathetic towards other people
58:15 it's really become self-aware of
58:17 anything that's going on in your life
58:19 the less your pineal gland works the
58:20 more you become a docile robot and
58:23 that's the truth it is rumored that the
58:26 Nazis gave it to the Jews in the
58:28 concentration camps in their water to
58:30 make them more docile to their captivity
58:32 so if that's true you get an idea of why
58:36 it was introduced to a particular
58:38 country like America a lot of countries
58:41 don't fluoridate their water
58:43 globally we do it's to control us I know
58:46 that sounds crazy and conspiratorial but
58:48 it's the stuff you should never have in
58:50 your body a case study is that by 1949
58:54 after generating so many aluminium
58:56 products for World War two we had
58:58 barrels of this stuff metric tons of
59:01 this stuff in liquid form that the Army
59:03 Corps of Engineers had to figure out a
59:05 way to get rid of it because it was
59:06 super toxic there's actually a video of
59:08 them dumping barrels underneath the
59:10 Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco in
59:12 California in the United States of
59:14 America telling the people that the
59:16 barrels will slowly decay over time and
59:19 all the fluoride will simply be which is
59:21 called fluorine in its previous state
59:23 there's nothing that gets done to it to
59:25 be put into your toothpaste besides
59:27 pulverized a little bit more but they
59:30 said it would get washed away into the
59:31 ocean poor fish right
59:36 why does a doctor a dentist recommend
59:39 fluoride well probably a large
59:42 percentage of them again are smart and
59:43 not intelligent they simply repeat what
59:45 they learned in school and they're
59:46 making a giant paycheck off of it as
59:48 depressing as the job might be but it
59:51 also facilitates their customers it gets
59:54 inside the enamel of your teeth the
59:56 theory behind fluoride solving your
59:57 tooth decay problem is that your teeth
59:59 are porous this fluoride is a metal dust
60:02 it gets inside the pores of your teeth
60:04 and just like iodine the theory is that
60:06 sugar will try to go in those pores and
60:08 the ethyl fluorine is already there and
60:10 so it bounces off and you're
60:14 miraculously not consuming sugar
60:15 therefore bacteria doesn't eat your
60:17 teeth bla bla bla bla bla ok sugar does
60:22 destroy your teeth before sugar was
60:24 introduced into the overall diet of
60:26 humanity
60:27 man died with all their teeth I was an
60:31 Egyptologist a hobbyist Egyptologist for
60:34 six years studying all of the tombs of
60:37 not only the workers but the Pharaohs
60:40 and they all had their teeth and they're
60:41 living in their 70s and 90s okay problem
60:45 with metal is that it expands it
60:46 contracts with heat so imagine filling a
60:49 hole a porous hole in your enamel with
60:51 this metal dust and then expands and
60:53 contracts as you drink cold water or hot
60:55 water cold water or hot meal whatever
60:57 and it starts to expand the hole now
61:00 instead of having one little particle in
61:02 there you get to well now you start to
61:07 remove enamel from your teeth and you're
61:09 putting fluorine in its place
61:11 aka fluoride eventually your tooth
61:14 cracks pops and you can get sheets of
61:19 your teeth like if you have your
61:20 straighter teeth not your your back
61:22 molars it'll just your bowlers just
61:24 explode you'll be eating something hard
61:26 and your tooth explodes and you blame
61:28 the butter brickle instead of the crap
61:30 you're putting in your teeth why does it
61:33 cause osteoporosis well your bones are
61:36 very porous how many of you've seen the
61:37 skull of a cow or something like this
61:40 some someone's house and you touch it
61:42 and it's very porous well same things
61:45 going on with your enamel is going on
61:47 inside your bones it can get into the
61:49 pores of your bones and the thing about
61:52 the human body is that it's a really
61:53 nice guy a really nice gal any time a
61:57 foreigner starts to show up in the body
61:58 the body just simply gets out of the way
62:00 oh you're here okay you're gonna grow
62:02 this big tumor in the body well that's
62:04 fine we'll just get out of the way
62:05 nervous system you're gonna be severed
62:08 in half because he wants to be here now
62:09 and bone you're gonna move away from
62:11 this stuff because I've got a new friend
62:13 we got a new visitor in the body and
62:15 that's why cancerous growths are so
62:18 horrible now there's two types of
62:21 cancers that are typically the the two
62:24 physical forms that it shows up in one
62:26 is Bal tumor cancer and the other one is
62:29 they're more invasive they call it
62:31 usually muscle invasive tumors but it
62:33 spreads out like a spider web like a
62:35 sticky paste inside your body that is
62:38 the most dangerous of them all although
62:40 tomber cancers are pretty horrible too
62:42 but you can usually have an operation to
62:45 remove a tumor even if it's gonna grow
62:47 back and you're not taking any of these
62:48 treatments right but the invasive stuff
62:53 can be inoperable because it is so
62:55 penetrated the spine of the brain or
62:58 some other pancreas or something that it
63:01 actually can't be pulled out a hundred
63:04 percent because it's all over the place
63:05 so again that's why I take C and b-17
63:10 every day okay just avoid it to begin
63:14 with right keep my Sugar's down you eat
63:18 meat responsibly my regimen of meat at a
63:21 minimum is to eat a piece of meat the
63:23 size of a deck of cards once a week and
63:26 I get the finest meat I get my hands on
63:28 you know range fed no chemicals no
63:31 hormones injected into it
63:32 now we all cheat which is why we take
63:34 the C in the b-17 so fluoride your
63:39 alternatives are this stop brushing your
63:42 teeth with it brushing your teeth is
63:44 what's saving your teeth not this
63:46 chemical chemistry you're putting in
63:47 your body at the same exact time if you
63:51 have the ability take the water main of
63:53 your house and fluoridate filter it but
63:58 a fluoridated filter I think they start
63:59 as low as $800 you can put one in right
64:02 in the main so the main of your house
64:03 comes in you filter it automatically now
64:05 if you're renting your property or
64:06 you're in an apartment you can put
64:08 filters on all of your showers and your
64:11 your sinks I think now you get one for
64:15 about a hundred bucks for your sink does
64:17 ten thousand gallons
64:18 same thing with your showerhead that's
64:21 what I do I have fluoridated filters on
64:23 both my kitchen sink and my shower
64:25 immediately all that stinky water that
64:28 you get al the fluoridation and chlorine
64:31 they put in your water it's just usually
64:33 it's the chlorine that stinks real bad
64:34 but it gets rid of it all and you'll
64:36 notice that the CLR the calcium lime
64:40 rust
64:41 also doesn't get through and you won't
64:44 have to clean the faucet as much once
64:46 you run out of your 10,000 gallons it
64:48 probably goes a little bit further than
64:49 that
64:49 you'll start seeing the the calcium lime
64:52 rust on your
64:54 on your faucet that's when you know you
64:55 need to swap out the filter 100% there
64:58 are tons of filters their gravity
65:00 filters so you can get this stuff out of
65:02 your system know that when you go to a
65:04 restaurant and you order tea or water
65:06 you're most likely getting fluoridated
65:08 if you're in a fluoridated community the
65:10 insanity of the whole thing is that
65:12 they'll tell you a little pamphlet you
65:13 get from the water company that this is
65:15 a medicine that's been added to your
65:17 water it's morally repugnant that they
65:22 would put a medicine in your water of
65:23 any kind because the dosage is different
65:26 for every human being based on body
65:28 weight and to put this in perspective if
65:31 you read the back of fluoridated
65:32 toothpaste they see if you swallow a
65:34 pea-sized amount of fluoride what you
65:36 know you do throughout a week they say
65:38 you're supposed to get your stomach
65:39 pumped don't see the poison control
65:41 center okay if you drink an 8 ounce 8 8
65:46 ounce glass of water you were consuming
65:48 generally this is according to dr.
65:51 Russell Blaylock who's a neurologist
65:53 retired neurologist who fights this all
65:55 day long you're consuming the same
65:57 amount of fluoride is that P amount of
65:58 toothpaste so they never tell you if you
66:01 drink a bunch of tap water you should go
66:03 visit the poison control center right
66:06 another thing super bad for you
66:08 processed foods processed foods are
66:12 ionized foods ionization is the negative
66:15 charge in an atom now you know that
66:20 opposites attract right so positive
66:21 attracts the negative negative tracks
66:23 deposit now imagine eating a ton of
66:25 processed food constantly this is fast
66:28 food this is any type of meal that you
66:30 buy where this the ingredients have been
66:32 sitting on the shelf for a year it's all
66:35 I niced it might still taste fairly
66:37 decent but what's happening is is well
66:40 ionized too you've tasted it when you
66:41 eat ice cream
66:42 you'd ice cream that's been in the
66:43 freezer for a long time and it just
66:45 stays weird doesn't taste like it's
66:47 because it's SuperDuper ionized it
66:49 tastes like metal that's interesting but
66:52 now imagine charging your entire body as
66:54 a negative overall you not your whole
66:57 body but you know your overall body has
67:00 a predominant negative charge and now
67:02 your brain is trying to send a message
67:04 to your pancreas on the on atomic
67:05 operating system that's there
67:08 do something but now that message is no
67:10 longer getting to your organ because
67:12 it's stopping it the first thing it is
67:13 attracted to which is an ionized atom so
67:17 you can essentially dirty up the phone
67:20 call around your body the more you eat
67:22 processed foods if your brain isn't
67:24 communicating with your body and your
67:26 body communicating with the brain then
67:28 you will lose complete control over your
67:30 body and the natural processes that you
67:32 were given as whoever created us or
67:35 where evolutions done you will get
67:40 unhealthy in a big way
67:43 another one is inflammation imagine I
67:47 took every cell in your body and I
67:49 inflamed it I made it bigger than it's
67:51 supposed to be well it's pretty easy to
67:54 walk through a crowd if there's room
67:55 that's really hard to walk through the
67:57 crowd if it's Mardi Gras and it's you
68:00 know 11 o'clock at night or it's a New
68:01 Year's Eve and you're downtown New York
68:03 trying to watch the ball fall you can't
68:05 move so many people
68:07 well imagine your bloodstream your
68:10 immune system your white blood cells all
68:12 trying to move through a body that is
68:14 super duper inflamed your capillaries
68:19 which are supposed to perform the duty
68:22 of oxygenating your blood an addition
68:24 addition to your lungs of course
68:26 bringing all the oxygen into the body it
68:29 can't perform its function sometimes
68:31 it'll just literally swell and break
68:33 it'll get repaired over time but imagine
68:36 being in a constant state of
68:37 inflammation what are things that
68:41 inflamed the body number one thing on
68:44 planet Earth that inflames the body is
68:45 called sugar man was never ever ever
68:49 meant to eat all this processed sugar
68:51 I mean seriously we were never meant to
68:53 ingest sucrose or any pure sugar that
68:57 didn't exist in a sugar cane in a sugar
68:59 beet it was never supposed to be boiled
69:01 down and boiled down and boil down to be
69:03 SuperDuper hot being super dense so
69:08 eating a bunch of sugar is not good for
69:10 you period
69:13 another thing sugar substitutes so say
69:17 you want to get away from sugar like oh
69:19 good I'll just go get a bunch of
69:20 aspartame I'll get
69:21 bunch of saccharin because they remove
69:26 the cancer caution off saccharin can you
69:29 believe that
69:30 well the story of aspartame getting
69:35 validated is but probably one of the
69:38 most legendary moments of CDC our sir
69:42 excuse me
69:43 FDA federal druggist Food Drug
69:47 Administration excuse me and
69:50 pharmaceutical corruption and
69:52 presidential corruption in world history
69:54 aspartame was a heart treatment that was
69:57 measured eventually as 22 times more
70:00 sweet than sugar and how you calculate
70:02 that I have no idea but they wanted to
70:04 put this stuff in all products to
70:08 supplement sugar to get rid of it to
70:10 replace it they did a bunch of tests a
70:13 bunch of clinical studies on rats and
70:15 monkeys now I was in pharmaceuticals
70:18 where they had monkeys we don't kill
70:20 monkeys we give them a drug look for the
70:23 indication if they start getting sick we
70:25 yanked them off that drug and get them
70:27 all healthy again because monkeys are
70:29 extremely hard to come by and we don't
70:33 want to kill them in the first place
70:34 right but now dogs they they kill dogs
70:37 by the truckload it's a horrible thing
70:39 so these people who are activists
70:41 against dog treatments their pet
70:46 treatments pet testing and all that
70:48 stuff there is a real good reason why
70:49 they have that that passion I used to
70:52 work in a building where they would back
70:55 a semi up to the building and you heard
70:57 dogs barking like crazy crazy crazy for
71:00 like half an hour I mean or to an hour
71:01 and you couldn't couldn't work the place
71:04 was just it's booming underneath my guy
71:08 was young and dumb and didn't know any
71:09 of this stuff so please forgive me for
71:11 not doing something not that I could do
71:13 anything we actually have one of our
71:14 facilities rated while I worked there
71:16 which was interesting and of course I
71:17 was on the other side of the camp going
71:19 those jerks but the dogs all got quiet
71:21 downstairs they all get sedated and then
71:25 they all get shipped out as corpses
71:28 aspartame killed all the rats and the
71:31 rats were just infested with cancer
71:35 there's photographs of it it's crazy the
71:40 monkeys died as I understand 9 monkeys
71:42 died which is unbelievable
71:44 the FDA at the time in 1979 looked at it
71:47 and said no way we're gonna let this
71:49 into the food supply of Americans the
71:53 company that was making it was Cyril
71:55 I think it's se ARL the CEO was none
71:59 other than Donald Rumsfeld we know him
72:01 as being a super ethical guy right you
72:03 trust your whole life to Donald Rumsfeld
72:04 right well they knew they had to do
72:07 something to get this drug out the door
72:09 so they did a couple things they offered
72:12 a bunch of FDA employees golden
72:15 parachutes golden careers you'd never
72:17 have to work again you're gonna have fat
72:18 salary for the rest of your life so they
72:21 bought off a large percentage of them of
72:23 the ones that wouldn't be bought off
72:24 well there's something need to know
72:26 about the FDA we don't elect those
72:28 people they get appointed and they get
72:30 appointed by the newly elected president
72:32 so Ronald Reagan in 1980 probably out of
72:35 sheer ignorance was given a piece of
72:37 paper where the pharmaceutical companies
72:39 have actually chosen all the people that
72:41 it should be working for the FDA which
72:44 means they're gonna launder all their
72:45 bad drugs out to us and so one fell
72:48 swoop of a pin Ronald Reagan fired the
72:51 rest of the resistance brought in all
72:53 the shells and when they needed to
72:56 actually process the paperwork of
72:58 clinical studies for aspartame they lied
73:01 about everything they totally wiped out
73:03 the monkey deaths and then they said
73:05 that the corpses of the rats that died
73:07 as a result of eating this stuff we're
73:09 so decayed well we don't need to talk
73:11 about that anymore so they essentially
73:13 wiped away all the evidence and got it
73:15 passed so what's the problem with
73:17 aspartame in the first place well it has
73:21 something called methyl ester in it
73:23 which is rubbing alcohol so that's one
73:26 thing you're eating the other thing
73:28 you're consuming is formaldehyde hmm I'm
73:32 gonna tell you this without you knowing
73:35 anything about those two things I'm
73:36 gonna suggest this if either one of
73:38 those substances were good for the human
73:39 body to consume you go eat it we'd be
73:42 eating it all the time it'd be like the
73:44 the miracle drug but we don't do we we
73:47 avoid that because
73:49 kill you well if you eat this stuff
73:51 that's what you have in your brain a lot
73:54 of people have grand mal seizures if
73:55 they're super allergic to it I work with
73:57 the guy it would have these seizures and
73:59 he'd bite his tongue he was drinking a
74:02 six-pack of diet coke with lime in it
74:04 all day long he had two visits to the
74:08 hospital where he had bitten his tongue
74:09 so hard they had to give him stitches
74:11 one of him while I was with him for
74:13 lunch I didn't realize this was what the
74:16 deal was back in the day that's about
74:18 2004 most likely he had a really bad
74:23 allergic reaction to it the other one
74:26 has genetically modified food
74:28 Monsanto's the company that should be
74:30 shut down and literally buried okay it's
74:36 a company that's in I believe it's in
74:38 st. Louis Missouri but it's recently
74:40 been purchased by someone else they're
74:41 starting to lose cases like crazy around
74:43 the world but they make a they make
74:45 poisons that's what they've always done
74:46 in their entire lifetime but they make
74:48 this poison for routes called glyphosate
74:50 spray it on a root root dies well then
74:54 they got this genius idea to depopulate
74:56 the world with this stuff and they
74:58 created genetically modified food as
75:02 I've heard it described but it seems
75:03 really sci-fi ish but they inject a
75:05 small particle of gold
75:07 I guess into a seed and that somehow
75:10 provides some sort of resistance against
75:12 glyphosate atomic properties so they
75:15 grow soybeans and corn and all kinds of
75:19 stuff right it's all GMO GMO apples
75:22 oranges all the stuff if you don't see a
75:24 GMO free label on your food don't eat it
75:27 period but you are eating a substance
75:31 that has a genetic inhibitor towards
75:33 procreation now if you grew soy beans
75:38 you can go back out and harvest the
75:40 seeds out of your crop because every
75:42 living thing creates a seed for its
75:45 procreation if it didn't while the hell
75:47 could it possibly procreate but what
75:49 they've done is they've inhibited that
75:50 part of it never to happen and it's for
75:53 all things why do they do that because
75:56 then you have to go back to Monsanto to
75:58 get more seeds and they're using non GMO
76:01 products
76:02 to create their seas and then they GMO
76:04 them now imagine your human being and
76:08 you're ingesting something that cuts off
76:11 procreation well I think if you look at
76:15 the fact that they snuck GMO food into
76:17 the food supply of America at least
76:19 without telling a single soul I mean
76:21 sure there's an article here and there
76:22 but they didn't say everybody you're
76:24 gonna eat this genetically modified
76:25 stuff that hasn't been tested for even
76:28 10 years on mankind
76:30 we had the fertility clinics blow up at
76:33 the same exact time it creates a
76:36 toxicity in women such that women are
76:39 actually treating sperm as as an invader
76:41 and it kills the sperm of their of their
76:44 husbands buddy mine had to get shots for
76:49 his wife so that she wouldn't spermicide
76:52 his sperm and then I think there were
76:56 other repercussions do the did the shots
76:59 having potentially thimerosal in them
77:01 that may have impaired her her mental
77:04 abilities they eventually got divorced
77:06 due to the mental corruption it's
77:09 horrible there's also something called
77:11 cell mimicry which is more of an atomic
77:13 vibration theory which makes complete
77:16 sense if if you were in a crowd and
77:20 everybody's swaying and you're not
77:22 swaying but your elbow to elbow with
77:24 these people you're gonna start swaying
77:26 because they're controlling you let's
77:29 imagine you are what you eat is
77:30 basically an atomic vibration situation
77:33 so if they're modifying DNA that you're
77:37 ingesting this is don't procreate your
77:40 own systems even those a gigantic you
77:42 know species you know barrier between
77:45 the two you're still ingesting something
77:47 that could take down your reproductive
77:48 capabilities but if you go look at rats
77:52 that have been treated with GMO corn
77:54 they have tumors in their bodies nearly
77:57 as big as the rat themselves the the
78:03 fraud that's being spoken by a lot of
78:06 folks that are being paid off by these
78:07 companies is you'll have even Mitt
78:09 Romney says this right bunch of
78:11 politicians say this they say if we
78:12 don't do GMO we're gonna run out of food
78:15 everyone's gonna starve
78:17 well we know that they don't care about
78:19 that okay they would solve world hunger
78:21 if they cared about that but America
78:23 makes for instance enough food to feed
78:27 probably 50 nations and our government
78:31 subsidizes farmers and buys off crops
78:33 and they burn them and now hopefully
78:35 with the latest changes we're gonna be
78:37 shipping that stuff to other countries
78:40 but nobody wants GMO foods anywhere in
78:42 their world India experimented with it
78:44 and it created so many economic problems
78:48 people started committing suicide at 25
78:50 these fathers were banning their kids
78:52 and so finally they they banned it
78:55 but Monsanto is evil when Santos goes in
78:58 and gets the country to a grief to
79:00 lawsuits if anyone's caught using their
79:03 seed without paying for it and of course
79:05 you just airdrop it all over the place
79:07 and then you go in and sue everybody so
79:09 that was one of the reasons why people
79:10 were killing themselves they didn't want
79:12 any of this GMO stuff in the first place
79:14 all the sudden it's and their little
79:15 crop the other ones microwaves
79:19 microwaves shatter food compounds into
79:23 food elements now that might sound like
79:27 what the hell does that mean the example
79:28 I always give which is easy to
79:30 understand it's the one that dr. Russell
79:31 Blaylock gave everyone is that if you
79:35 took an apple for instance with the skin
79:37 on it and you microwaved it and there's
79:40 some recipes that call for this exact
79:41 thing some people make apple pies with
79:44 the appeal on the outside the peel of an
79:50 apple has pectin which is a great source
79:52 of fiber but it also has a methyl ester
79:55 particle bound to it when you eat an
79:58 apple you're fine because the methyl
80:00 esters bound to the pectin and it
80:03 travels through like a fiber and you
80:05 pass it out of your system but if you
80:07 microwave it you run the potential of
80:08 shattering the methyl ester off of the
80:11 pectin and now you're essentially
80:12 ingesting the equivalent of aspartame
80:14 flooding your body with toxin Russia
80:18 banned microwaves just as soon as they
80:20 came out and they didn't do it because
80:21 they wanted to keep their their citizens
80:24 down they banned it because they looked
80:26 at its properties found out this flue
80:29 compound
80:30 during issue and said we're a socialized
80:33 communistic country that has to pay for
80:35 all the healthcare we don't want a bunch
80:36 of people sick and so they banned it and
80:39 one of my partners as of 2004 she did
80:42 her internship in Russia for four to six
80:45 months and she said you know I cuz I
80:46 asked her I said microwaves
80:49 did you see microwaves when you're in
80:50 Russia and she goes you know it's weird
80:52 she goes there was one microwave in the
80:53 whole village and she goes at first I
80:56 was walking clear across the village to
80:57 use it to warm up coffee and that kind
80:59 of thing and she said eventually I
81:00 realized that gas ovens do about the
81:03 same exact timetable as a microwave so
81:08 as soon as I found out I threw out all
81:09 my diet dr. pepper and I threw out my
81:13 microwave I gave it away and it was a
81:15 beautiful unit I will never buy food at
81:18 a restaurant that microwaves anything
81:19 and that's why when you go to when you
81:22 see Gordon Ramsay you know you're two
81:25 Michelin star chef he goes into these
81:28 restaurants where he would clean them up
81:29 he look around if you saw a microwave
81:31 he'd go what are you making in this
81:33 thing and he'd have it thrown out turned
81:35 off get rid of it because the elite of
81:38 the world one they eat meat to keep
81:39 themselves healthy but - they don't
81:41 microwave any of their food
81:43 why does food taste weird when it goes
81:45 through a microwave is because your
81:47 taste buds are registering the food
81:49 compounds when you shatter it into a
81:51 food element you don't look or taste the
81:53 same that's one reason why it's so blah
81:57 so one of the other things they talked
81:59 about talked about all the time is
82:01 carcinogens
82:02 something's carcinogenic age it's
82:06 carbon-based mass that you eat well you
82:12 know where do you get carcinogens
82:13 well carcinogens exist and generally
82:15 everything but again your immune system
82:17 is a pretty kick-ass apparatus which
82:19 will keep you healthy for you know most
82:22 of your food in gestation right but if
82:24 you overwhelm your body with carcinogens
82:26 you will infect your body with something
82:29 that has the ability to melt your body
82:32 internally that's my term for this my
82:36 verb for it if you sear your food you
82:41 burn your steak you burn your
82:43 bacon you burn your marshmallow anytime
82:46 you're ingesting the blackness of having
82:49 burned away everything else in the body
82:51 everything else in the food excuse me
82:53 the body of the food and you're just
82:55 ingesting that crusty stuff that is
82:58 probably the most pure form of
83:00 carcinogenic food you could possibly
83:02 consume I recommend you don't do it I
83:04 know some people love it they love their
83:06 marshmallows burned up they like their
83:08 bacon burned up they like steak that's
83:10 really seared well take your vitamin C
83:15 and b17 if you're one of those kind of
83:17 people maybe you'll never have a problem
83:18 with it and again some people's bodies
83:21 are beautifully balanced better than
83:22 others it is my personal belief that
83:26 when we started mixing or started moving
83:29 people around the world where they were
83:31 very attuned to the food supply and bugs
83:34 that are in their part of the world and
83:36 they moved completely around the world
83:38 and then started meeting with other
83:42 races we sort of disturbed the overall
83:45 balance and it'll take a little while
83:47 for us to get everything back together
83:48 now sometimes we probably make
83:50 superhumans when we do that so it's not
83:52 that not the case in all cases but
83:54 that's somehow that's some of the
83:56 techniques you can get to sort of wobble
83:59 out your genetic pool I think that's why
84:05 people are some people more susceptible
84:06 than others to cancer but here's what
84:09 carcinogens do in sort of an analogy all
84:12 right how many of you know what a
84:15 mudslide is you have a hill and the hill
84:19 typically is made of dirt and the dirt
84:24 holds on to dirt as long as it's dry but
84:28 you put water all over that that
84:30 mountain due to a massive rainstorm and
84:33 then it slides and it can potentially
84:36 kill people down downwind right why is
84:39 that happening it's happening because
84:41 the water acts like a ball bearing like
84:43 a lubricant inside the soil and the soil
84:45 simply can't hang on to itself because
84:47 it's being infiltrated by something else
84:49 that is more fluidic right when you eat
84:53 carcinogens you have to think about the
84:55 atomic properties of your
84:57 you trying to hold together we are
84:59 carbon-based life-forms so we have to
85:02 have our carbon behaving inside of our
85:04 body in order for it to remain healthy
85:07 if you introduce a bunch of foreign
85:10 carbon into your body that is not in the
85:12 form of a higher construct like food
85:14 then you're essentially putting in
85:17 something that can get inside of your
85:19 cellular tissue inside of your potential
85:22 your protein patterns your DNA and start
85:25 to confuse things start to rip apart
85:27 cells just lubricates things because
85:30 you're introducing the base component of
85:33 which you're created by so you have to
85:34 be careful okay so now you have a bunch
85:37 of different techniques you can use and
85:39 I want to you know I obviously have to
85:41 continually disclaim this thing I'm not
85:43 a doctor all right I just know what I
85:46 have seen with my own two eyes with the
85:48 doctors telling people they're gonna die
85:50 and they use these techniques and they
85:51 don't die and they're perfectly fine
85:53 afterwards and live full beautiful lives
85:55 down to a cat living a full life as you
85:59 know using b17 injections but what is
86:05 very tough to combat is a whole life of
86:09 believing these individuals and then you
86:12 hear someone online say something that
86:15 the contradicts that money making cash
86:19 making machine that is oncology now do
86:24 you think it's cheap to run a hospital a
86:27 cancer facility no do you think it's
86:31 cheap paying for all the doctors no do
86:35 you think that bankers want to be poor
86:36 because they create a bunch of cures no
86:40 when I was in the pharmaceutical
86:41 business the way that it worked for me
86:45 to do my software design was that I had
86:46 to go to meetings with the head chemists
86:48 I had to use other people's pass cards
86:50 in some cases to get to the rooms others
86:53 not but I was the last priority on the
86:56 list and so I got to listen to their
86:58 meeting first and then my meeting was
87:00 like a five to ten minute report on what
87:02 I was doing and get their feedback on
87:03 the version of the software that they
87:05 had been toying with so I got to see how
87:08 they make drugs and how they decide
87:11 which
87:11 to make and the biggest joke they would
87:13 say about once every six months was we
87:15 should create a cure in the whole room
87:17 would laugh and the laugh said we could
87:21 but that would put us out of business
87:23 and so they were into treatments let's
87:26 just keep someone alive and then there
87:29 were things where it's like wow we can
87:31 drain someone's make account a hundred
87:32 percent with this particular condition
87:34 now the company I work for didn't have
87:36 anything to do with oncology whatsoever
87:38 but they were huge huge I never
87:41 mentioned them so that I don't get a big
87:43 backlash from them at some future point
87:46 they make one of the famous pain killers
87:48 that you actually take nowadays but now
87:52 imagine I got a business bottle and I'm
87:54 a real evil person which is anyone who's
87:58 running a corporation who doesn't have a
88:00 passion for something great like a Steve
88:02 Jobs who wanted to create fun toys for
88:03 everyone right the guy's not perfect but
88:06 you know he was just trying to entertain
88:08 himself and cells sell his inventions to
88:10 other people so he could have what he
88:11 wanted you know but imagine you have a
88:14 family member that comes down with
88:15 cancer and you don't know anything about
88:18 these other techniques and by the way
88:20 there's a lot of other techniques you
88:22 should just go research them yourself
88:23 try to find a human being on the phone
88:26 face to face that's actually used a
88:28 technique before you try it that's my
88:30 that's my recommendation to validate the
88:33 treatment but again a lot of these
88:34 things as long as they don't make you
88:36 sick or hurt your body you might be able
88:38 to do all of them who knows right and
88:40 there are some good doctors out there
88:42 that secretly recommend this kind of
88:44 stuff so you might just keep searching
88:46 around but imagine you had a family
88:49 member that comes down with cancer and
88:52 let's just say they're slightly elderly
88:54 I hate to use that word because it's all
88:57 in your head and it depends on how your
88:59 body is reacting to the way you've
89:01 treated yourself but you in your later
89:03 years you're above 50 let's put that way
89:05 and you managed to save a nest egg app
89:09 to retire on that maybe he's $150,000
89:12 $200,000 it's your entire nest egg to
89:16 survive until death yeah it's social
89:20 security that and you can burn it a
89:21 little slower maybe you have some
89:23 annuities
89:25 but they see you and they think oh my
89:28 god
89:29 we're gonna bleed this person dry when
89:33 they're gonna come through I mean you
89:35 know some of you guys have insurance
89:36 they'll actually endure a long cancerous
89:38 treatment a lot of cancer sorry a lot of
89:41 cancer policies or policies for health
89:43 will cancel the second you actually have
89:45 cancer that can't be cured with a cup of
89:47 water I've seen this happen multiple
89:49 times of the companies I work for when I
89:51 was a kid one of the companies I worked
89:53 for we had to switch health care
89:56 providers four times because the the
90:00 husband of our VP of Sales who was a
90:02 woman she put her husband on our on her
90:06 health policy because he was home dying
90:08 of cancer and they kept canceling the
90:10 entire company's policy so 75 employees
90:13 had to constantly renew and eventually
90:15 they made her take him off and get her
90:17 own policy so that's how great that is
90:20 but undoubtedly you will be tapped for
90:24 cash for what you're doing and they will
90:27 bleed you and bleed you and even if
90:28 they're bleeding the insurance companies
90:29 that can only bleed the insurance
90:31 companies if they have a patient that
90:32 qualifies for the treatment to keep you
90:35 sick keep you sick keep you sick
90:36 meanwhile you're dying your family
90:39 members dying they don't care they
90:41 looking at a ledger this is the greatest
90:43 thing ever this person walked in that
90:44 they saved our winter we had all those
90:46 cancer cases come through one of the
90:49 biggest scams that happen when Obamacare
90:50 in the United States was about to come
90:54 on board is that a bunch of people were
90:57 diagnosed with cancer just before the
91:01 new policy was coming on board because
91:04 they wanted to milk the last remnants of
91:06 this health policy one of my friends was
91:09 told he had terminal bladder cancer
91:11 invasive bladder cancer well he took
91:16 matters into his own hands found the
91:17 number one world expert on bladder
91:19 cancer here in Los Angeles California he
91:21 went to him they read biopsied his
91:23 bladder and said you don't have any
91:25 cancer at all don't know what the hell
91:26 these people were talking about but they
91:28 were talking about removing his bladder
91:29 using part of his intestine to make a
91:32 bladder
91:32 he would have lose all sexual function I
91:35 mean they were ready to just destroy
91:36 this guy's life to make a buck
91:39 and luckily there was this guy that said
91:42 you know you're fine you're totally
91:45 cured if you had anything you don't have
91:47 it now
91:48 they gave him tuberculosis shots into
91:50 his bladder to fight cancer very bizarre
91:52 treatment again if you wouldn't trust
91:56 McDonald's with your health you
91:58 shouldn't trust a pharmaceutical with
91:59 your health you shouldn't trust a
92:01 hospital with your health and I know
92:02 it's very counterintuitive the human
92:05 body is meant to have a child squatting
92:07 in a step and a standing formation you
92:09 stand in you squat that's how our bodies
92:11 have been designed to have babies and
92:13 that's why in third-world countries they
92:15 don't have any hospitals where they have
92:16 babies but they have this huge
92:18 population explosion going on and
92:20 they're sitting there squatting now we
92:23 actually have birthing pools where you
92:25 can squat inside of a pool of warm water
92:27 pretty cool but if you get a hospital
92:30 they tell you get on your back which
92:32 causes all the complications of having a
92:34 child which is why now they try to sell
92:35 you on caesarian constantly because they
92:38 know they've created a problem and why
92:40 they don't just switch to squatting I
92:42 have no idea they could build a really
92:44 nice apparatus to make a woman very
92:46 comfortable during that process is it
92:47 gonna make it painless hell no will it
92:49 reduce probably breaches and a bunch of
92:51 other complications yeah so I can tell
92:55 you from being in the bowels of these
92:56 organizations there's no morals these
93:00 head chemists are such robots and not
93:03 all of them in the entire world I mean
93:04 I've got a second cousin that brand
93:07 merck pharmaceutical for 20 years plus
93:10 he's a very ethical man but then again I
93:12 don't spend every single day with the
93:13 guy maybe he presided over something I
93:16 wouldn't approve of I don't know but the
93:19 guys I worked with very smart but just
93:24 off as human beings their empathy for
93:27 problems have been flushed out of their
93:29 system a long time ago in med school now
93:32 we have a few things that are coming on
93:34 board that I'm going to throw at the end
93:35 of this episode and some of you aware of
93:37 this and we just need to keep our eye on
93:38 it the cell phones that we use today are
93:41 running on the fourth generation
93:43 backbone called 4G G stands for
93:46 generation not gigahertz your home
93:49 network is running off
93:52 gigahertz reading now again the
93:57 cellphone and its power supply is the
93:59 number one cancer causing situation with
94:01 the cellphone ecosystem but g5 is going
94:07 to be profoundly different than g4 I
94:10 have a whole episode on it
94:11 5g dangers if you want to go take a look
94:14 at that since season three now the the
94:18 counter theory to this caution I'm going
94:20 to give you is that the professionals
94:22 say look the amplitude of which these 5g
94:24 networks operate on is so weak it
94:27 doesn't have the atomic ability to
94:29 shatter your cells it just can't they
94:33 say that an average incandescent light
94:34 bulb has more radiation than a 5g router
94:37 for cellular distribution right hmm
94:40 we're gonna have to find out but
94:44 scientists before 3G even released were
94:47 warning the world that 3G could be
94:49 configured to manipulate the mind of a
94:52 human being where an electrical being
94:55 and we operate on infant essa mph R
94:57 actions of electricity to transmit all
94:59 the messages in our immune system and
95:01 our body our autonomic system and
95:04 everything else that our body does so
95:06 you don't want to introduce some wave of
95:07 energy that can disturb that one of the
95:11 things has been tracked in San Francisco
95:13 is they have this gigantic tower which
95:15 they have a lot of antennas attached to
95:17 and at the base of that tower according
95:20 to this full-blown study that this
95:22 independent scientist did and he
95:24 published his findings and he's had
95:26 several town hall meetings about it
95:28 but he said the leukemia at the base of
95:30 that tower was at 97% for the population
95:33 that lived below it in addition he
95:35 tracked all the leukemia cases and
95:37 different radiuses increasing away from
95:39 the tower and it was you know it went
95:42 down it went down proportionally so the
95:44 further you wael from it you can get to
95:46 zero but the closer you get to it
95:47 someone in your families got leukemia
95:49 leukemia is a cancerous condition of the
95:54 blood I've had friends die of it okay
95:57 now again you could take these regiments
96:00 and potentially cure a particular
96:01 instance of cancer but if you're sitting
96:04 right next to something
96:05 is giving you cancer guess what you got
96:08 to do you got to sell the house and you
96:09 got to get away from it if you're gonna
96:11 buy a home try to stay away from high
96:14 tension towers try to stay away from
96:16 cellular towers try to start to stay
96:18 away from any transmission towers of any
96:20 kind television transmission towers
96:22 whatever but here's your problem I don't
96:27 know where the nearest 4G antenna is I
96:30 think there's one maybe a quarter of a
96:31 mile diagonally from where I'm sitting
96:33 it's just up to look like a palm tree
96:35 but when 5g comes out we're gonna have a
96:40 transmission tower I've been a
96:42 transmission box on these lines that go
96:45 between the houses I met every two
96:47 houses and why is that because the
96:51 average wave of a 4G signal is about two
96:54 and a half feet long the full sine
96:56 cosine wave for those of you who used to
97:00 listen to radio back in the day you know
97:01 that an AM radio signal would go into a
97:04 tunnel for little ways where fm would
97:06 immediately die it's because FM is a
97:08 higher frequency and can't bend around
97:10 corners the same thing goes for five g
97:14 5g we're reduced from two and a half
97:17 feet from 4G to a quarter-inch or by
97:21 about centimeter excuse me about a
97:22 centimeter SuperDuper tight wave now if
97:27 you think about the fluoridation of your
97:29 of your drinking water you have no
97:31 choice if your county subscribes to this
97:34 horrible regimen of putting fluoride in
97:36 your water then you have to avoid it
97:38 everywhere you go because it's in
97:40 everything it's at every restaurant
97:41 you're gonna go to take a shower someone
97:43 else's house you're gonna get exposed to
97:45 it if you don't protect yourself at your
97:47 house you're getting expose to it and it
97:49 really hasn't been any studies about how
97:50 fluoride absorbs to the epidermis but we
97:53 have eyes and mouth and teeth or sorry
97:55 our nose and ears so we have a lot of
97:57 orifices that things get absorbed into
97:59 to absorb things that get on our body
98:02 the problem with 5g is that we're going
98:07 to be utterly bombarded by 5g waves
98:10 every place we go on earth we never ever
98:15 want to introduce a technology that
98:17 could be changed
98:19 you know you know what if the natural
98:20 frequency of 5g or 4G or even 3G wasn't
98:23 going to be able to disturb the average
98:25 thought process of a human being but you
98:29 could modify it for split seconds to do
98:32 that very thing
98:33 France supposedly has recognized the
98:36 fact that the cellular towers are very
98:38 unhealthy to the children at schools we
98:42 have a school in Fountain Valley High
98:44 School off of Bouchard Street that has a
98:47 cellular tower right on right in the
98:49 parking lot up against the building
98:52 these schools will get paychecks as
98:56 small as two thousand dollars a month to
98:58 keep those antennas on their grounds you
99:02 mean to tell me that the cellular
99:04 companies can't find more benign places
99:07 on earth to put these things or maybe
99:09 they have an agenda we have to be
99:10 concerned about getting them close to
99:12 kids but France supposedly I read a full
99:14 article about it said they were gonna
99:16 actually hardwire all the schools now
99:19 again I don't know how if we don't
99:21 hardwire our telephones there's no
99:22 technology to tether it through a wire
99:24 that I know of anymore
99:25 to get Internet through some other means
99:27 so these kids are gonna still carry
99:28 their cell phones in the school if
99:30 they're allowed to right so as we move
99:33 forward we need to take all of this
99:35 empirical knowledge about how cancer is
99:37 created about how it transmits to our
99:38 body and apply it to our regiments of
99:42 do's and don'ts but when you have
99:44 something being introduced against your
99:46 will without your knowledge especially
99:48 you know GMO foods were introduced to
99:49 the food supply and nobody knew about it
99:51 the other thing that blew up when GMO
99:54 foods entered the sector and really
99:55 became a predominant amount of the food
99:58 that Americans consumed is we have
100:00 probiotics GMO food is supposedly
100:06 responsible for killing those those
100:08 little tentacles in your intestinal line
100:10 that are responsible for absorbing
100:12 nutrients and there's an electrical
100:14 problem with the glyphosate proof food
100:17 going into your body it electrically
100:20 zaps those sensors and destroys them the
100:23 flesh literally goes away it has to
100:24 regrow the sensor so imagine eating a
100:26 bunch of GMO foods and zapping your
100:28 upper intestine to the point where it's
100:29 incapable of ingesting any of the
100:31 nutrients that you eat
100:32 what's gonna happen to your body you're
100:35 gonna get cancer because you're not
100:36 eating what you're made out of
100:37 you can't absorb it if you do eat it now
100:40 one of my personal beliefs and this is
100:42 where I'm gonna close on this and some
100:44 of you will viet miele disagree with
100:47 this but keep it in the back of your
100:49 brain just in case you get sick because
100:51 a lot of people are now reporting
100:52 they're getting sick from this eating
100:53 regimen vegetarianism and veganism is a
100:57 very dangerous regimen as a pure source
101:00 of food again I've had two senior
101:05 nutritionists one guy was in his 70s who
101:08 look like he was in his 50s and I asked
101:11 him both about the meat issue about red
101:13 meat I said what do you think because I
101:16 went off on a I was a Chicot Aryan for
101:19 11 months and ended up in the hospital
101:21 incapable of getting up in the morning I
101:24 was so delusional that I just didn't
101:28 care about life it was weird I was just
101:29 I was literally delusional and they did
101:31 $800 with the blood test the guy came
101:33 and looked at my iron levels and said
101:35 this last time you ate red meat and I
101:37 was like 11 months ago he goes go eat a
101:38 steak you're gonna feel perfect in two
101:40 days I'm what Nate a London broil that
101:43 night I woke up the next day with more
101:45 energy than I had had in two years swear
101:47 to God I also was eating too much cheese
101:50 so I almost never eat cheese anymore
101:52 just locks up your body why do that to
101:54 yourself but the theory is is that were
101:57 made out of proteins and vegetarians
102:01 have been told this line of crap that
102:03 why not just eat the proteins
102:05 genetically out of the ground instead of
102:07 eating them when they go through a cow
102:10 well we obviously know a cow's not a
102:12 plant so it is has a different genetic
102:14 code different protein patterns that
102:16 make it a cow
102:17 we are Homo Sapien sapien we have our
102:19 own protein patterns that make us what
102:20 we are we have to eat the base
102:22 components of which we are made out of
102:23 such that we can prosper in this world
102:27 very few okay and there's some
102:30 propaganda going on which you have to be
102:33 careful about very few elitists of the
102:35 world ruling class people monarchs are
102:37 vegetarians now you have people like
102:41 Bill Clinton saying he's a vegetarian I
102:43 think Al Gore even said he was a
102:44 vegetarian and one of the
102:47 whirring properties of malnutrition
102:48 through vegetarianism is that you're
102:50 obese and so you become a vegetarian and
102:53 all sudden you lose all that fat and
102:54 you're like oh my god I feel amazing I'm
102:56 not I can run again my thighs don't
102:58 touch each other and so you think hooray
103:00 hooray this regimen is great for me or
103:03 someone will have been a meat-eater up
103:06 until like 28 they got rock-hard abs big
103:08 muscles and then the switch and the two
103:10 years later like I feel great look at my
103:12 rock-hard abs it's like let me come back
103:14 to you when you're 40 and let's see if
103:15 you don't have some pancreatic cancer
103:18 Steve Jobs died of an inability to
103:20 process meat proteins when they tell
103:23 them you need to eat meat or you're
103:24 gonna die he said I won't do that it's
103:27 against my morals so they tried to give
103:29 him injections I try to give him food
103:30 and he would like you know dry-heave
103:34 because the theory of eating it was just
103:36 too much for his brain but if you don't
103:40 eat what you're made out of what's gonna
103:41 happen well for quite a few years your
103:44 body will cannibalize the other
103:45 materials in your body to recreate its
103:47 organs so your pancreas is going well
103:49 this guy's not eating anything I'm made
103:50 out of or three out of eight things that
103:52 I'm made out of are coming in through
103:54 these veget vegetables but I can't
103:57 recreate the cells properly because I
103:59 don't have the building blocks and so it
104:01 starts stealing from other cells in your
104:02 body it's very resourceful why do people
104:07 get pancreatic cancer well obviously all
104:10 the toxicity issues I've mentioned in
104:12 this show can contribute but it's one of
104:14 the most complex organs in the body and
104:16 is one of the most fragile organs in the
104:17 body and such that when it fails you die
104:22 pancreatic cancer recovery percentages
104:26 are four percent meaning 96% of the
104:29 people with pancreatic cancer diet
104:31 pancreatic cancer you've never heard of
104:32 a surgery where they took out my
104:33 pancreas today and I feel so much better
104:35 you can't get rid of that organ it must
104:37 perform so your pancreas is one of the
104:40 first things to go when you don't eat
104:41 what you're made out of there are now
104:43 channels all over YouTube of people that
104:45 are coming out of vegetarianism and
104:47 veganism and finally having to admit
104:50 something they wouldn't want to MIT
104:52 before because they thought they were on
104:53 this righteous path they said they were
104:57 sick they caught everything that went
104:59 around constantly mothers are saying
105:00 there
105:01 children were utterly sick and some of
105:02 these cases are women that were married
105:04 to men who taught veganism in five
105:06 different regiments so they had all
105:09 kinds of different types of
105:10 vegetarianism and veganism and their
105:12 kids were utterly unhealthy they were
105:14 unhealthy and the second that the woman
105:16 divorced the man and started feeding her
105:18 kids some meat boom the immune system
105:21 blows up their school scores go up their
105:23 energetic they're happy and they're no
105:26 longer sick all the time
105:28 so let's loop back on the GMOs so if
105:33 GMOs have a secret objective and some of
105:37 you may choose not to believe this but
105:38 for those of us have been following this
105:39 for over a decade it's sadly for me
105:42 extremely true and seeing the moral
105:45 corruption inside the medical industry
105:47 there's just no it's not a stretch
105:49 whatsoever but if they wanted to
105:52 depopulate the world through a food
105:53 supply that sterilizes human beings that
105:55 want you to eat as much of it as
105:56 possible well they don't have according
105:59 to my research GMO cows they definitely
106:02 have GMO chickens okay meaning they're
106:06 just bizarre you know you know what is
106:10 it island of dr. Moreau kind of chickens
106:12 right that's why you don't eat chicken
106:14 in public unless it's like at a nice
106:16 health food store and they've got you
106:19 know disclaimers on a look this chicken
106:20 was listening to classical music and
106:22 drinking champagne up to the point it
106:24 was slaughtered for you to eat you know
106:25 that kind of thing but you'd want to
106:27 promote a regiment of eating where they
106:29 would eat as much of this stuff as
106:31 humanly possible and I think vegetarian
106:33 veganism is all about getting you to
106:35 consume as much GMO as possible if you
106:37 have problems with your gut go take some
106:39 probiotics right so the probiotic is
106:42 doing some of the bacterial cleansing
106:44 that your body would normally do if it
106:46 wasn't dying if you're vegetarian or
106:49 veganism or vegan excuse me and you're
106:52 secretly getting ill I need you to think
106:56 about it again when I talk to these
106:58 nutritionists the last guy I had talked
106:59 to he gave me the deck of cards thing I
107:02 said well how much food should you eat
107:03 and he goes look if you eat a deck of
107:05 cards I mean a piece of steak the size
107:07 of a deck of cards which is nothing once
107:10 a week you've got all the protein you
107:12 need for that week and so you could be a
107:14 vegan the rest
107:15 the rest of the week so if you did have
107:18 a history of eating meats you might
107:20 consider just introducing a little bit
107:22 into your diet not a lot
107:24 you don't need 16-ounce steaks they're
107:27 all seared and full of fat now obviously
107:30 when you go to a fast-food place and you
107:33 eat something you think is meat you most
107:35 likely aren't unless they can prove it
107:37 to you in the claims on the menu 100%
107:40 grade-a beef da da da da it's Kobe steak
107:44 burger it's Angus burger at the ton if
107:48 you go to McDonald's just go get
107:49 yourself a little hamburger as an
107:50 experiment don't eat it just buy it open
107:54 it up and look at the patty and see if
107:57 you don't see stuff that looks like
107:58 fossils in there you see a little round
108:01 disks in there a lot of that has to do
108:03 with the fact they're grinding up the
108:04 entire Cal all the grades e stuff that
108:07 can't be sold it's you normal
108:08 restaurants or normal food supply and
108:11 they crunch it all together and they
108:13 give it a color of beef and they put
108:15 food additives in it to make it taste
108:17 like beef and you think you're eating
108:18 food you're not eating food fast food is
108:22 not food it just isn't now there's a
108:24 couple exceptions with a couple
108:26 restaurants you know we have in-and-out
108:27 burger here in town they serve real
108:29 stuff they're you know their fries are
108:31 brand new there so it's like a potato
108:33 and they just shred it and barely cook
108:34 it and give it to you so that's probably
108:36 the most decent place you can get that
108:38 kind of stuff if you're gonna have to
108:40 eat fast foods you need to go up and
108:42 really do some research on which ones
108:44 are good and which ones bad use Google
108:46 Maps find out where the ones are in your
108:48 town they can that you can eat from and
108:50 if you can't find any it's time to start
108:52 packing to lunch cancers man-made 100%
108:57 man-made unless you are juggling you
108:59 know uranium bars so understand if
109:02 someone gets cancer young there's
109:04 something in the food supply something
109:07 in the water something in the
109:09 environment that's causing that cancer
109:11 prematurely if man had a history of
109:14 catching cancer the way that man has
109:15 cancer today man would have been extinct
109:19 millions of years ago if you're
109:22 creationist and you think God created
109:24 you well then very simple your regiment
109:27 is don't introduce things that guy
109:28 didn't make into your body God didn't
109:31 give you you know sunscreen that God did
109:37 not give you processed foods
109:38 he did give you a bunch of crap he
109:40 didn't build this world to a radiator
109:42 with billions of megahertz and gigahertz
109:47 of wireless technology you didn't do
109:51 that
109:52 so just think about that as you live
109:55 your life for any of you live in the big
109:56 city and you take a vacation to places
109:58 like Hawaii you go to the Midwest and
110:00 stay in a ranch you go up in the hill
110:02 somewhere you'll automatically feel your
110:05 brain reduce and stress and that is 100
110:09 percent related to the electromagnetic
110:11 frequencies that are bombarding your
110:13 body go to a place where your cell
110:15 reception is horrible and take your
110:16 vacation because that's a safe place now
110:20 one of the things that I've heard done
110:21 locally which is very interesting is I
110:24 don't think it was intentional there was
110:26 a bunch of houses built in Laguna Hills
110:28 which is south of me about 25 miles and
110:30 they filled their walls with sand and so
110:34 I think it's a cinderblock Center they
110:37 fill the cinder block which is hollow
110:38 with sand and then they build the
110:41 framing around that and they build a
110:42 wall and the walls are like about a foot
110:44 and a half foot two foot and a half
110:45 thick one of my good friends asked me to
110:49 come over and help him wire his house
110:50 for wireless networking and we found out
110:52 that his walls were so dense that we
110:55 couldn't get a router to go around the
110:57 corner and I said boy this is like the
111:00 best house in the world for your health
111:01 you may just want to stay wired where
111:03 you can't just drop a router drops our
111:06 hard line out of your wall because he's
111:07 got money and just you sit out the sofa
111:10 you plug it in boom you're good at night
111:13 if you keep a bunch of electronic
111:15 equipment next to your body you're most
111:17 likely have very impaired sleep one of
111:20 the things that's not related to cancer
111:21 that will also probably improve your
111:23 sleep is if you keep your devices on in
111:25 your bedroom even if it's far away from
111:26 you but you leave all the sound on for
111:29 chirping for emails and notifications
111:31 that stuff is most likely waking you up
111:34 but by the time you wake up the sounds
111:36 over and you think you're having poor
111:38 sleep but it's because of the phone turn
111:40 the thing either completely off
111:42 shut off all vibration put it in full
111:44 mute mode and keep it away from your
111:46 body everyone else can wait we live most
111:49 of our lives in this world without every
111:51 phone call being answered right you just
111:53 rang went to the voicemail or it just
111:55 rang or if you're on the phone they got
111:57 a busy signal and everybody survived and
111:59 the world is actually a much better
112:00 place so there's a bit of that regiment
112:04 you can reintroduce to your life so I
112:06 know there's a lot of you that listen to
112:08 the show regularly you have other
112:09 treatments you can point us to please do
112:12 that in the comment section if you guys
112:13 have any questions about this stuff
112:15 please put it in the comments section
112:17 again if you're really nervous about
112:19 these alternate treatments the best
112:21 thing I could tell you is you could do
112:22 both of them at the same time I will
112:25 only caution you that the people that
112:27 have taken chemotherapy and the b-17 si
112:29 solution found themselves cure due to
112:31 the sea and extremely unhealthy do the
112:34 draconian chemotherapy which again
112:38 hasn't been renewed in over 30 years in
112:41 terms of its methodology right it's a
112:44 big cash cow for the corporation so just
112:46 remember when you walk into an oncology
112:48 department they just see dollar signs
112:51 okay again probably the majority of the
112:55 employees that these institutions have
112:57 no idea what they're involved in they
112:59 have no idea that they're contributing
113:01 to this overall corporate hungry machine
113:04 but when the rockefellers bragged in the
113:06 20s they're gonna own us from cradle to
113:08 grave you need to understand they own
113:10 the food supply companies to give you
113:12 the cancer they own these cellular
113:14 companies and all this other stuff
113:15 through their investment banking arms
113:18 their aristocracy and then of course
113:23 when you get sick in the end they own
113:24 you through all your therapy and of
113:26 course if they can find a method to
113:28 drain you of all your finances they're
113:33 gonna do it so be careful the only thing
113:37 I'll say at the very end here is as
113:39 legislation introduces itself to make
113:41 some of these treatments mandatory on
113:43 the human body you need to put your
113:45 thinking cap on and realize you don't
113:47 want that kind of mandate there have
113:49 been people in the United States of
113:50 America who've had their houses raided
113:52 in the middle of the night to capture
113:53 their children to go off and be
113:56 forced to take chemotherapy Wow Wow you
114:00 don't even have the sovereign ability to
114:02 manage your child's life to manage your
114:04 life your spouse's life these
114:06 pharmaceutical companies have
114:07 infiltrated this the law enforcement so
114:09 bad that a police officer there's no
114:12 idea what they're doing we'll go in and
114:13 force you to die of this stuff there's
114:17 also rumors that there are cures to
114:19 cancer coming out but they're synthetic
114:21 so be careful why go synthetic when you
114:25 can go organic right with the best
114:29 treatment of all is prevention
114:31 prevention prevention take all of the
114:33 causes in this video to heart change
114:35 your life feel better if you lived in a
114:38 perpetual fear of dying of cancer well
114:42 then start taking these treatments
114:44 especially b-17 and vitamin C on a daily
114:46 basis you don't need to do the massive
114:48 dose of 17 but nothing's gonna kill you
114:51 if you do I take approximately one to
114:54 two thousand milligrams to see a day I
114:56 take a hundred milligrams of b-17 along
115:00 with it and I avoid all the things that
115:03 I told you in this video as much as I
115:06 possibly can again 5g is gonna be
115:08 introduced against my will so we all
115:11 have to pay attention to the cancer
115:13 cases when this stuff starts arriving if
115:15 we have a surging cancer I don't know
115:18 what you do maybe take matters in your
115:19 own hands and get rid of it in your
115:21 neighborhood you will find out that
115:22 there are people in your circles of
115:24 friends that have used these techniques
115:26 successfully but they are so scared to
115:28 say it because they don't want the
115:30 backlash that they'll keep quiet for a
115:33 really long time if not forever
115:35 so as outrageous is maybe some of this
115:38 sounds to you you're probably in a pool
115:40 of people that have actually used it
115:41 from time to time keep that in mind as
115:44 well now if you haven't been to any
115:46 other shows and deep thoughts they're
115:48 quite different than this show so I
115:49 understand if you just come visit the
115:51 show and leave and you never come back
115:53 the language in the show is very mature
115:56 because that's sort of keep it real
115:59 policy we have on this show so I
116:00 apologize if you switch to another video
116:02 and you start hearing things that you
116:03 would not want to hear this is for
116:05 adults for the most part so if you have
116:08 little kids in the room and you
116:09 trying to play it out loud in the
116:10 kitchen maybe not the best choice just
116:13 gonna precursor with that meaning
116:15 episodes not not this one we have one of
116:18 mr. Rogers it's really clean so anyhow
116:21 Viet Minh of deep thoughts radio calm
116:23 please go that's where you can change
116:24 feeds from video to audio audio to video
116:26 we have a lakh Facebook group we have a
116:28 Twitter account two ways to donate to
116:30 the page patreon and PayPal for those of
116:34 you on patreon that even donate $1 a
116:36 month you get these video links the
116:38 second they upload from my computer and
116:40 in about a week I'm gonna be able to do
116:42 that a lot faster than I used to
116:44 so we'll speed up the pipe a little bit
116:47 we also have a link to the new season
116:49 one that is a different channel on
116:52 YouTube it's in most of the descriptions
116:54 of all these channels if you want to Co
116:55 go over and see a remastered season one
116:58 where the initial this episode will
117:00 actually be uploaded to in addition I'm
117:02 gonna go ahead and put it in the normal
117:03 stream just so people have it getting a
117:05 lot of questions about this recently
117:08 that's the place to go a bit shoot is
117:11 finally on board so we're able to upload
117:14 everything to bits you so eventually
117:15 when I hit a critical mass of videos I
117:18 will put the link up there to bid shoot
117:19 it's just like YouTube
117:20 it's just uncensored so it's nice it's
117:25 anyway until next episode take care of
117:27 yourself and someone else over now
