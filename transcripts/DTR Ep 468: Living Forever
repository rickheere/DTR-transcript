00:21 [Music]
00:29 welcome back ladies and gentlemen now
00:33 for you it's probably been just a few
00:34 days or so since you saw last video for
00:39 me it's been about a week and a half
00:43 since I've recorded a new episode we had
00:46 services for mr. Syd Mead this last
00:53 Sunday I guess sorry two Sundays ago and
01:00 it was very beautiful and interesting
01:03 for those of you don't know I'm talking
01:05 about if you're brand new the amazing
01:08 visual futurist who invented the title
01:11 as a matter of fact Syd Mead sy d MEA
01:15 decom has passed as of the end of last
01:20 year at a I think a beautiful age of 86
01:24 I had the privilege of working with him
01:29 for 20 years
01:32 it's amazing human being on every
01:35 conceivable metric for the nicest guys
01:40 almost brilliant guys and this is kind
01:46 of what this episode is all about is
01:49 this notion about man's a sort of
01:54 immature desire to live forever and
01:58 because we we never really talked about
02:02 it in that sense
02:04 we don't we all die at least our bodies
02:07 do now you're talking you're listening
02:10 to someone talk to you that believes we
02:11 live forever in a different sense I
02:14 guess what I am addressing in this
02:17 particular episode is the notion of
02:19 living forever as a human being which i
02:22 think is a bad idea
02:24 but there's this there's so many little
02:26 phrases out there that talk about this
02:28 whole concept and one of them is you
02:33 know in order to truly appreciate
02:34 something you have to lose it
02:37 or at a minimum it must be a rare thing
02:39 why do we like gold bars and diamonds
02:43 and other precious jewels because it's
02:45 rare why do we love certain people and
02:49 other people we just like them because
02:53 they're rare I you know I'm in a weird
02:59 position where if I want to mention
03:01 something about somebody famous then I
03:06 get I can't you guys haven't done it
03:08 really but it does enter that realm of
03:10 the name-dropping thing but I want to
03:14 give you a story that happened at the
03:20 services and I want to tell you who did
03:22 it because he deserves credit for being
03:25 way more brilliant than some people
03:28 realize and as brilliant as some folks
03:31 realize they can't even conceive so a
03:35 few years back
03:36 mr. Kanye West who is a prodigy in many
03:41 categories of life if you don't think he
03:45 is then you don't get him that's all I
03:47 can tell you and it's just it's not just
03:51 as his ability to write incredible
03:53 stories in his songs but to create who
03:57 produce the most amazing beats and music
04:00 and he saved people's careers better
04:02 huge names and and he is in Deborah now
04:06 he'd also experiments so you may not
04:09 like every single track he's ever done
04:10 or whatever but he and Sydney friends a
04:16 few years back and it was through a
04:20 mutual friend that someone was gonna see
04:22 Syd and he said oh man can I tag along I
04:24 love Syd and said you know I should say
04:27 sorry Kanye is very very well aware of
04:33 incredible design because Kanye has
04:36 style as a human being which I'm still
04:40 determining whether or not you can be
04:41 born without it and gain it part of you
04:45 think she can't
04:48 but he's got it and so you know when
04:54 they met it was interesting because I
04:56 know that Sid it has no clue sorry I
04:59 don't mean it's a clue but he has no
05:00 idea what Kanye's music sounds like what
05:02 Kanye is really done with his life saved
05:05 just reading an article here in their
05:06 instance of fashion he's doesn't play
05:08 music he's done all kinds of stuff and I
05:11 wasn't present during any of their
05:12 conversations but Sid sent me a
05:14 photograph of the two of them posing in
05:16 his house which I thought was fantastic
05:18 and the entire time I've known cities
05:21 he's worked for Michael Jackson Sid he's
05:24 worked for Michael Jackson two or three
05:25 times he knows all the chance to work
05:28 with Tom Cruise and he's been around
05:30 celebrities his whole life with
05:31 incredible directors like Ridley Scott
05:33 you know and you know he doesn't have
05:40 any negative stories about those
05:42 individuals but this one just really
05:44 stood out for him and when I went over
05:46 to visit Sid after one of his
05:49 conversations with Kanye it was like man
05:53 this kid is really intelligent man I
05:55 said yeah isn't he it's like yes he's so
05:58 polite and brilliant and he's just
06:01 really on a different plane and I said
06:02 yes exactly
06:04 and so you know I knew that there was a
06:07 chance that Kanye would show up with
06:08 services just because he's very
06:11 respectful
06:12 now unfortunately about two hours before
06:18 the services started Kobe Bryant died in
06:23 a helicopter accident along with his 13
06:25 year old daughter and the the other five
06:28 individuals
06:29 excuse me seven individuals plus the
06:31 pilot copilot right so five and two more
06:33 horrific situation and I want to make it
06:38 clear because there's all kinds of weird
06:39 conspiracies around the pharmaceutical
06:40 company that was trying to go after his
06:42 black mamba name it really looks like
06:45 the pilot realized it was the weather
06:48 was bad too bad to be driving flying an
06:52 aircraft and he brought the vehicle down
06:55 about 1,200 feet and there's been pilots
07:00 in the area think that they know exactly
07:02 what the guy was trying to do because
07:03 he's very aware of the terrain that he
07:04 was trying to fly to a helicopter pad
07:06 that's a part of a police precinct and
07:10 unfortunately he turned left a mile
07:13 before he was supposed to and if he had
07:17 turned left in a mile the mountain
07:20 terrain that he ran into wasn't there
07:23 and so it's just a really horrific
07:26 situation so all this informations
07:28 coming to Kanye and we don't know we're
07:31 sitting in the service we have no idea
07:32 that this has occurred and there was a
07:37 moment when everyone was allowed to go
07:38 up and speak and say something I put
07:44 myself on the list and my name wasn't
07:46 called but then I kinda thought about
07:48 you know everyone said everything I
07:50 would have said pretty much but they
07:53 kind of had indicated that all of the
07:55 speakers were done and the man who
07:59 started their services who's I don't
08:01 know who the guy is what he's brilliant
08:02 he kind of looked over and he was like
08:05 he's look because I'm right in the front
08:06 and it's outside it's beautiful we're
08:13 looking at a big beautiful picture of
08:14 Sid I'll give you a photograph picanha
08:18 went up to the podium I didn't see him
08:22 arrive because he had arrived a little
08:23 bit later and he was extremely
08:24 apologetic about arriving late but I
08:28 don't think he really anyone would
08:30 consider him being late but anyhow he
08:33 got up there and spoke beautifully I
08:37 mean you've never seen Kanye speak this
08:39 beautiful that I've ever seen on camera
08:44 but he really talked about how important
08:47 it is that people like Sid exist because
08:50 without Sid and people had said versions
08:53 of this but Kanye's was really beautiful
08:56 he he just said you know people like Sid
09:01 are very important because he designs
09:04 our future and he gives us a glimpse
09:06 into what might be a utopia and then
09:09 Kanye said something I thought was
09:11 utterly brilliant and if you die-hard
09:13 listeners
09:15 are listening it's just like an aha
09:17 moment man he said you know I think
09:22 utopia is turned into a dirty word or a
09:26 bad word who's that what a shame that is
09:29 right and this all relates back to
09:32 people like Sid creating these visions
09:34 of the future that we should use to
09:38 guide ourselves into the future you know
09:40 Sid is designed your future whether or
09:42 not you realize it or not it doesn't
09:44 matter if they happen up we have an
09:45 apocalypse and then we reinvent
09:48 ourselves someone will find says working
09:50 code I make it look just like that you
09:52 know but it we're all in this service
09:56 you know missing an amazing man and so
10:01 at that point you know the rarity of Sid
10:05 which is one and 8 billion it really
10:07 starts to we all kind of knew it you
10:10 know we definitely appreciated Sid while
10:12 he was alive but who sits around looking
10:14 at your friend think you know when
10:16 you're dead it's as I'm gonna think
10:17 about you there are so many you know
10:20 comic book characters and fictional book
10:23 characters that go back to the beginning
10:24 of time about human beings that were
10:26 immortal
10:28 you know the whole Adam and Eve thing
10:31 they were immortal until you know
10:33 certain beings have the ability to stay
10:35 immortal if they do certain things like
10:38 a vampire could live for a really long
10:39 time he's constantly draining someone
10:41 there's been the funny takes on you know
10:47 these these pharaohs say they're female
10:50 or male pharaohs usually it's the female
10:51 pharaoh who lives into you know forever
10:54 because she constantly sucks life out of
10:56 something and then there's the the
11:00 real-world objectives of trying to live
11:03 forever Kurtz well who wants to perfect
11:06 a computer such that he couldn't upload
11:09 his consciousness into it and live in it
11:10 forever
11:11 you know Kurtz well at one point you
11:14 know he was just taking pills for a
11:15 living I mean for eating he wasn't
11:17 eating any foods he was taking tons of
11:19 pills and then he got extremely sick and
11:20 almost died from it it is amazing how
11:24 utterly brilliant people can be and how
11:25 utterly stupid they can be
11:28 I mean you just get a doctor nade into
11:31 your own [ __ ] and then you just
11:33 continue
11:34 it's really weird miss possum is over
11:38 there there's the I mean if if the
11:41 record industry weren't a bunch of
11:42 douchebags I would have started this
11:43 episode off with them the Queen song
11:46 about living forever do we really want
11:49 to live a really long time some of it
11:53 might be interesting if you're I would
11:57 say maybe below 40 it might seem more
12:00 appealing the the closer you get back to
12:02 your youth and as you get older you may
12:06 have a subplot that says yeah let's go
12:09 ahead and live another I don't know 50
12:12 years maybe another hundred years
12:14 you know without losing your eyesight
12:15 and you're walking capabilities and all
12:17 that stuff we're talking about living a
12:19 healthy life right you'll read article
12:23 after article and I have to tell you the
12:26 younger that you are this means a
12:28 different thing but the older that you
12:30 are the more you laugh for instance let
12:34 me give you a side a parallel analogy
12:37 for this whole thing I have read since
12:41 the mid 80s in Omni magazine when I was
12:43 a kid that they were going to auction
12:47 off trips to the moon for orbital
12:50 purposes only to bring you back to earth
12:53 every single decade some ridiculous
12:57 organization says that they're selling
13:00 these tickets I mean they sell the
13:01 tickets they talk about our being sold
13:03 the tickets these billionaires put their
13:06 money in hundred and seventy million
13:07 dollars to go around the moon and it's
13:10 never happened not unless they're using
13:13 a completely different space program
13:14 than we're aware of it just happened
13:16 again someone just posted and thank you
13:18 for posting it because it proves my
13:20 point
13:21 but you'll read these articles about how
13:23 we're inventing youths IRMS and how
13:25 we're gonna live forever and all this
13:27 stuff let's um let's really parse that
13:32 for just one second
13:34 there's no doubt that they can start to
13:37 identify things that are causing us to
13:40 get older such as was the ink caps of
13:42 your chromosomes are the latest theory
13:46 we do know that adrenal chromes are used
13:51 to really maintain a very healthy
13:53 appearance up to a certain point but
13:55 haven't you seen your favorite king or
14:01 queen or rich oligarch get really old
14:06 look at George Soros his last
14:08 photographs my god he is like that dude
14:12 from the end of Indiana Jones whose face
14:15 is [ __ ] melting and he just kind of
14:17 pushed pause you know that guy looks
14:20 like [ __ ] now the Queen of England
14:23 always looks pretty amazing but she does
14:25 age right so if all these people have
14:29 these youths IRMS at the tippy tippy top
14:31 of the pyramid then we aren't seeing any
14:33 evidence of it you know maybe maybe
14:35 there's a Hapsburg somewhere or
14:40 Rothschild like a Jacob Rothschild he
14:42 was getting old before he disappeared
14:43 off the planet where are all these
14:46 youths IRMS man
14:48 the Windsor family can't find a solution
14:51 for hair loss yet you know the the first
14:56 son lost all of his hair he's in full
14:59 convertible mode his father you know his
15:03 a little bald patch on the back at least
15:05 they could fix the bald patch right the
15:07 only Donald Trump could find it
15:08 somewhere on planet Earth he's got all
15:11 this hair but boys I don't know what's
15:12 going on with that ere do I do look
15:16 younger every every day here's the
15:20 problem with living forever yeah I think
15:23 you would go insane fairly quickly based
15:27 on forever right but let's just say we
15:31 can take a pill and live 300 400 500
15:36 years something on that order now Sydney
15:40 comes back into play here because I
15:41 think he made one of the most accurate
15:45 observations of
15:48 man's ability to conceive of the future
15:51 remember this guy designed the future at
15:54 a level that no one ever has and may
15:57 never again and I don't mean necessarily
16:00 his designs are accurate to what they
16:03 will be in the future if you listen to
16:07 said talk about how he thinks in order
16:10 to create the future he is looking at
16:13 millions of metrics of human
16:16 consciousness culture history all the
16:20 vectors of all things as it is perceived
16:25 by man such that when he writes when he
16:28 draws something on paper he is
16:30 calculating sort of like a past in
16:33 football he's calculating where your
16:35 brain will be when his image hits the
16:38 screen in a particular environment
16:40 whether it be Blade Runner or Tron or
16:42 Elysium or whatever he is thinking about
16:46 absolutely everything he was a Nikola
16:51 Tesla in terms of designing the future
16:54 in that way you know Tesla would always
16:55 design machines in his brain he would
16:57 age ball bearings for two years just in
16:59 front just to figure out whether or not
17:01 he should change their gauge or
17:02 something Sid was probably that with a
17:07 few orders of magnitude over in terms of
17:10 how he determined what we would accept
17:12 that's a design and what's interesting
17:14 is and what I would love to see and I
17:18 won't be able to see it necessarily is
17:19 that he has designed things that that we
17:21 don't have propulsion systems to realize
17:23 just yet but it'll be interesting to see
17:26 if his designs actually are caught the
17:29 pass is caught in the future where
17:32 people go wow that is exactly the way it
17:36 should look like right now maybe back
17:39 then they thought it was corny maybe
17:40 back then they thought it was
17:41 unrealistic but right now that's exactly
17:43 how would she look and maybe since world
17:46 has realized the hundred percent well I
17:49 mentioned Sid right now well he has
17:52 always said this is one of the first
17:54 conversations I ever had with him
17:58 he said I think that the furthest that
18:00 man can conceive out from today is about
18:03 300 years beyond 300 years all of the
18:08 circumstances that would affect the mind
18:11 the minds perception and you know what
18:16 other propulsion systems how do we use
18:18 clothing how is technology integrated
18:20 with the humanity where is humanity in
18:22 the solar system / universe / galaxy all
18:25 these things become so afraid in 300
18:28 years the predicting out is beyond that
18:32 point is really just a crapshoot it's
18:35 random and so living beyond that point
18:39 introduces a bunch of obstacles and
18:43 challenges that we have not solved
18:48 because we've never been there before
18:51 now those of you believe biblical things
18:54 well yeah he could be it could be that
18:57 we ate all natural foods and we didn't
18:59 screw up our blood types and by
19:02 malnutrition and we didn't do a bunch of
19:04 other stuff move around just gag our
19:06 whole ecosystem of what the human body
19:08 wants maybe we did live a long time but
19:12 I do think that an individual who would
19:14 live say a biblical 800 years 900 years
19:17 a thousand years would have left a
19:20 fingerprint behind because their IQ
19:22 would have developed so intently
19:25 intensely I guess you could say in
19:27 attentionally that it would leave an
19:31 indelible mark on the world and maybe
19:34 that's what happened maybe the people
19:35 that design the pyramids were you know
19:37 eight hundred years old they had
19:38 discovered Piatt long before the Greeks
19:40 so they discovered pi they discovered
19:43 the Pythagoras theorem before Pythagoras
19:45 was even a concept of existence it's
19:48 proven just look at the pyramids man so
19:53 if at this stage we started to live a
19:55 really long time and it's not exactly
19:57 the focus of this episode imagine that
20:02 you're a hundred years old but you look
20:03 like you're 35 or 45 or whatever you
20:07 look fine
20:08 you feel fine maybe a little bit exam
20:11 pains
20:13 how do you digest seeing your
20:17 great-great-great-great
20:18 great-great-great grandchildren that
20:20 have nothing to do with you in terms of
20:22 being in common with you because they're
20:24 in their infantile stage stuck in a
20:26 cultural envelope that you have sort of
20:31 floated over because you come from a
20:32 culture of say let take me I was born in
20:35 the last year of the 60s 69 so my
20:40 definition of youth and childhood and
20:43 it's probably on an underdeveloped view
20:47 at 50 having not lived a hundred years
20:49 under 50 years etc would be the 70s and
20:52 the 80s were amazing maybe I'm wrong
20:59 most people agree with me who grew
21:00 through those eras and now see what's
21:02 happening with the world you know if you
21:04 were doing it by yourself
21:05 and everyone else is dying at normal age
21:08 that would just be rough you know we can
21:10 I have two gentlemen just a few
21:13 generations back that lived 100 years of
21:15 peace over a hundred years of peace so
21:16 two guys father and son they clips two
21:21 hundred five years man when I met three
21:25 wives so they one of them at least had
21:27 two but I think he had three as well
21:28 because their wives passed away that's
21:32 rough been but let's just talk about
21:36 anyone out there listening to this who's
21:39 thought about how romantic it would be
21:41 to be immortal one I don't know how you
21:43 remain immortal in this universe because
21:46 eventually even with whatever I don't
21:51 know when I guess there's some belief
21:52 systems where you I guess live till
21:54 Judgment Day or you would live till the
21:57 firmament dome was opened up and God
21:59 would come get you whatever but if you
22:02 were remotely believing this was
22:05 scientific and this was no I don't mean
22:09 without design and without intent a
22:12 matrix turns off or the let's just take
22:16 a heliocentric normal thing just to
22:18 drive a point home not to offend anybody
22:20 else
22:21 but something might take out planet
22:23 Earth Leonard if my opinion will
22:27 continue expanding until the crust
22:28 ruptures and it turns into a gas giant
22:30 just like all the other gas giants that
22:32 aren't babies planets they're actually
22:34 ancient planets what are you gonna do
22:39 you're gonna float around you're gonna
22:41 sink to the middle of this thing you
22:44 know it'd be zapped on the the ball of
22:46 plasma I mean like what are you gonna do
22:48 you're gonna create a vehicle and get
22:50 the hell out of here
22:51 what if it's impossible they're gonna
22:53 swim through the ether of space I mean
22:55 my god what a terrifying notion that
22:58 might be right living forever obviously
23:01 comes with a lot of requirements right
23:03 is the twilight zone where the man
23:05 signed a deal with the devil it taught
23:08 us you'd have to be invincible you would
23:12 not need to eat or breathe which would
23:15 remove a lot of other activities in your
23:18 life
23:19 everybody could and it wouldn't matter
23:21 if you didn't but there comes a point
23:23 and I've mentioned this several times in
23:26 several different episodes but I really
23:28 hit me when you know saying goodbye to a
23:33 friend recently I think that there's
23:35 something beautiful about the way that
23:38 perhaps we have designed the universe
23:42 that our souls have this infinite
23:44 property because nothing can collide
23:48 with your soul your soul doesn't need to
23:51 feed off things that are in short supply
23:54 right you can starve to death in a human
23:56 body but you can't starve to death
23:58 necessarily as a soul you might get very
24:00 lonely again maybe hell is nothing more
24:03 than being isolated away from all the
24:05 other souls for a certain amount of time
24:07 while you figure out what you did maybe
24:10 there is no punishment whatsoever
24:11 because by the time we pass away the
24:13 context of your life was a mere instance
24:16 of your life and it in the in the realm
24:20 of infinity you realize if anything is
24:22 of a certain static size compared to
24:24 infinity then it is infinitely small and
24:29 so what's one instance of being Hitler
24:32 when you can spend the rest of your time
24:34 being Gandhi
24:36 okay now do I think the dying young is
24:41 what we're talking about in here in
24:42 terms of the opposite argument
24:44 absolutely not I do think that there are
24:50 tons of things that we get to experience
24:54 on this planet but then at the same time
24:55 if we were to be reincarnating and
24:57 living in this roller coaster and
25:00 there's probably roller coasters all
25:01 over the matrix of which you can ride
25:04 and it could be a beam of light one day
25:06 you know just to be really abstract
25:08 about it you could stay in your soul
25:10 form for a while do whatever you want
25:14 maybe we're all just trees you know
25:17 these stages that we go through in life
25:20 that are amplified by loss and loss is
25:26 all over the place if you really think
25:28 about it right we are born and we are
25:34 welcomed into this world by our family
25:37 members my great grandmother on my
25:41 mother's side got to meet me my
25:44 grandfather on my father's side meaning
25:46 his father got to meet me but both were
25:49 gone before I turned three I mean my
25:52 grandfather my father's side yeah I
25:57 guess he had died yeah but I was about
25:59 two and a half or something like that
26:01 you saw me as a little kid though he got
26:02 to meet me he was cool so you do lose
26:05 your you know your oldest family members
26:08 right off the bat and then you get a
26:11 nice buffer of 20 to 30 plus years where
26:16 hopefully your grandparents aren't too
26:17 old and you can get to know them as well
26:21 I was very fortunate the first
26:22 grandparent that ever passed for me I
26:24 was 25 years old but it was a big bummer
26:28 because it was the grandparent that I
26:30 was the most close to its closest with
26:32 my father's mother her and I were best
26:36 friends men and what was interesting is
26:39 his I am starting my life as this rocket
26:42 ship of my life started to take off and
26:44 amazing things were happening my
26:45 daughter was on the way and I was unable
26:48 to go to her
26:49 which is it's very important to me to
26:51 see someone out of this world and
26:53 respect them I couldn't go because my
26:56 kid was potentially gonna show up here
26:58 any day and so I had to miss it and I
27:01 you know later I found I could have gone
27:03 but it was literally services were the
27:06 end of January 1995 my kid was here
27:09 within two weeks so it was definitely a
27:12 close call but like I always tell my
27:14 friends if I was at a funeral when my
27:17 daughter was born my grandmother would
27:18 have come out of that grave and swatted
27:21 me okay so you lose your family members
27:24 as you get older all right well
27:26 depending on how close you are that's a
27:28 big deal or it's not a big deal now
27:31 typically your parents will go quite a
27:33 distance before you pass away and some
27:36 of you have really older parents so that
27:39 can be more immediate and that's a shame
27:42 my father lost his dad when he was 23
27:45 years old so imagine that that he died
27:48 of a heart attack
27:49 he had a congenital problem that was
27:51 specifically for him like no one
27:54 inherited it and so he lost his dad
27:56 really early which is a lot of
27:57 mentorship missing from his life I
28:00 really as I grew up was really sad that
28:04 my father didn't have that but what else
28:07 do you lose you leave you lose your
28:11 naivete you lose your bliss you lose
28:16 things like believing and magic in a
28:20 very fun harmless way magic each one of
28:25 those changes each one of those Delta's
28:27 in your life it's it's a it's a mini
28:34 funeral you could say you'll never be
28:37 that young again you'll never experience
28:39 that particular thing in that particular
28:41 frame of mind at that particular place
28:44 in life and I'll tell you this I'm I
28:48 haven't been able to John Malkovich any
28:51 of you but which if you don't understand
28:53 that reference go see the movie Being
28:54 John Malkovich
28:56 but I haven't been inside your mind so I
28:59 can't quite perfectly tell this but I
29:01 think that one of the curses of a really
29:05 sharp memory and a very early point of
29:09 remembering your life that is if you are
29:13 fond of your childhood if you're fond of
29:16 your earlier memories and you really
29:19 remember them then that funeral has more
29:26 tears it has the bagpipes you know which
29:30 if you haven't been in a funeral with
29:31 bagpipes you've never felt your soul cry
29:34 before
29:35 holy mackerel but I really really
29:39 remember my youth and I really remember
29:41 even though my parents were getting
29:42 divorced at one point you know bad
29:45 things were happening to me technically
29:48 speaking you know in terms of other
29:49 people observing the situation in going
29:51 on it's really sad that had to go
29:52 through hmm I found ways of having a lot
29:55 of fun amazing things happen and I
29:59 remember it and I've shared most of all
30:03 of them with you and so even without
30:07 dying parts of my history are nothing
30:13 but memories and to think that as I've
30:18 watched my friends and family members
30:23 get old and pass away I think one of the
30:29 isn't this doesn't always happen and
30:31 sometimes you get a relapse of what I'm
30:32 about to say but as your body stops you
30:36 know interfacing with your soul in an
30:40 efficient manner because it's its
30:41 degradation rate you start to lose those
30:46 priceless memories sometimes like some
30:49 people can't remember those things and
30:50 some folks can only remember the past
30:53 one of my girlfriend's aunts she went
31:00 through this she lived a boat in her 90s
31:03 so she lived a great life but she was
31:06 always very very conservative
31:09 never drank alcohol and there was this
31:12 moment when she was in her assisted
31:15 living but like she ever was quite in
31:17 Hospice
31:18 she was always mobile what-have-you but
31:19 they said that she was talking about
31:21 having been to a night club with jazz
31:25 which is a little strange because she
31:27 was actually a girl that was probably in
31:33 her 40s about the time that jazz was
31:35 really popular in the 50s our late 30s
31:38 at least but she was talking about
31:40 wanting to get another margarita
31:43 which is just endearing and wonderful
31:47 everybody in the room was like oh my god
31:48 that's kind of cool
31:49 she never drank a drop out alcohol the
31:51 whole time we knew her and so in her
31:54 dementia however the body was
31:57 interacting with the soul and it's
31:59 storage system out there in the universe
32:02 she was able to go back in her past and
32:06 live it so vibrantly that she desired it
32:09 first one second it was like a
32:11 cornerstone in her moment in her life
32:13 that was so positive she wanted to do it
32:17 again but she never did it as an adult
32:20 that we know of I've been getting a
32:23 margarita my hometown it's much easier
32:25 today but 50 60 70s
32:28 I'm sure where the hell you would go in
32:30 the Midwest to get one maybe I'm just
32:32 being stupid but it's interesting I
32:38 don't think any one of us want to really
32:41 accept the paradox of we have to lose
32:47 something in order to appreciate it
32:48 because at an absolute statement that is
32:52 not true obviously there's plenty of
32:56 times in my life and I'm sure in your
32:58 life where you had something that you
32:59 either circumstance you have a job you
33:02 loved you had whatever you had a
33:06 girlfriend boyfriend that you loved the
33:07 husband wife whatever someone very
33:11 special in your life
33:12 child whatever in something happened and
33:17 they were taken away from you
33:19 circumstances change the bankers crashed
33:21 the banks and take away
33:22 your opportunity in life and you watch
33:26 it disappear maybe even in some rare
33:29 cases you know it's coming you know
33:32 because I was awake in two thousand
33:34 eight and seven and six and five I knew
33:38 the crash was coming did know exactly
33:41 what month but by mid eighteen was gonna
33:45 happen in December and sure enough boom
33:48 then I watched my beautiful company with
33:52 her because my clients disappeared when
33:55 you have tons of clients it's almost
33:56 inconceivable that your company can
33:58 disappear and it happened then we got a
34:02 lot of amazing things done after 2008
34:05 the boy you know the budgets were small
34:08 people very antsy about you know
34:12 innovating because they realized they
34:14 had a limited amount of cash themselves
34:17 it's a bummer man so we're in this
34:21 constant cycle aren't we we're
34:23 constantly saying goodbye to friends and
34:25 family because it happens it happens
34:27 randomly
34:28 I mean imagine this I didn't mean to
34:30 integrate Kobe's horrible situation into
34:34 this episode but isn't that interesting
34:36 a 41 year old basketball prodigy and by
34:40 all means celebrated individual is gone
34:45 and that's something that everyone can
34:47 just immediately mourn and then you hear
34:49 the extra news about the other eight
34:52 people including a thirteen year old
34:53 daughter and some other young children I
34:55 believe which are friends of the family
34:57 that were also on that helicopter that
34:59 don't even get mentioned by most people
35:02 that's sad man right but now how many of
35:07 us then I can definitely tell you was
35:10 this Shack was talking about the loss of
35:12 Kobe and he said last time you talked to
35:15 Kobe was at a championship game or
35:16 something which I guess someone did some
35:20 math and said that's two or three years
35:21 ago that Shaq had not talked to Kobe
35:23 which in their brain is a little bit
35:25 weird but they made this you know well
35:29 even Shaq said look we don't tell people
35:30 that we love them enough and everyone
35:33 says that because everyone comes to that
35:35 conclusion
35:36 go tell someone you love them you know
35:39 living forever does that fix everything
35:43 nobody dies hmm if Coby forever well it
35:49 depends right but if Coby was a prodigy
35:52 basketball player and when you're in
35:54 your 20s and 30s that's important to you
35:56 and it's important to him and then you
35:58 go on living this is still important
36:02 that he was a really good you were a
36:04 really good basketball player yeah it
36:05 was funny I haven't done that like a
36:07 hundred years I know right we should try
36:10 to see if we could do to you you get out
36:12 there and you get bored again just like
36:13 ya already had this mastered let's go do
36:15 something else
36:15 sorry it becomes like a huh whatever we
36:22 like to think that our God our one God
36:25 central consciousness whether he or she
36:29 be the universe or an entity as
36:31 Michelangelo would paint the Catholic
36:33 Church would have you believe a very
36:35 Caucasian guy yeah weird this is so
36:40 bizarre
36:40 a white Jesus and a white God Wow I'll
36:44 be privileged but you know God living
36:47 forever you think about it first but
36:51 second you think move that is a huge
36:53 responsibility unless God is doing the
36:56 same sort of little trip we're taking
36:58 you know it seems like hell wouldn't it
37:02 which is why you know I have no real
37:09 instinct I don't even know what to say
37:13 your indicator or whatever but the
37:15 notion that we're all the same being and
37:19 they were just living on top of
37:20 timelines like you're me and I'm you
37:23 which is why if I hurt you I feel bad
37:26 because I've hurt myself that really
37:30 just makes the world and the whole
37:33 universe all the matrix characters make
37:36 amazing sense now it does kind of seem
37:39 like you know that were true we've got a
37:41 lot of NPC's in the universe and not the
37:44 grayface NPCs and the woke movement but
37:47 the one that I talked about which is
37:49 fictitious characters that we invent
37:52 just like world of warcraft to pass out
37:55 quests and there are the bosses that we
37:58 go and kill you know that run this
38:00 planet they're just there to create
38:02 strife and create tension maybe some of
38:07 them are positive I don't know who I
38:08 would point out that's positive that I
38:10 would think wasn't conscious but boy
38:12 these is very good the reptile thing
38:14 right take um who this just this just
38:18 occurred to me this is gonna be cool
38:20 okay on that note take David Ickes
38:25 famous ever everyone who's bad in the
38:29 universe is a reptile shape-shifting
38:32 reptile right they shape-shift into the
38:36 Queen or whatever right your local
38:38 sheriff and then take the matrix the
38:42 movie where was it Agent Smith would you
38:48 know shape-shift into anyone you just
38:49 take over your body and be you if you
38:51 happen to need to be in your area at the
38:53 time and then take this NPC idea and
38:59 just simply say that well they're there
39:01 they materialize as an algorithm
39:06 response to your perception of the
39:08 universe because you actually create
39:11 your own universe one of the things I
39:15 think I've attempted to explain this and
39:17 many many years ago but let me do it
39:18 again since we're talking about perhaps
39:20 looking forever what if we do create the
39:23 universe as a personal response to our
39:27 belief systems and our our experiences
39:32 in this world and what if the matrix is
39:35 simply trying to give you what you want
39:37 and so take my take my world 70s
39:43 fantastic 80s fantastic again my family
39:45 was broke at time with my dad and I were
39:47 brokenness but that way another family
39:49 members they all had money but he never
39:51 broke together fighting through the
39:53 world and you know I was wearing shitty
39:55 clothing and it was just like come on
39:58 jobs get my own job with a w-2 at 13
40:02 lines
40:03 I was 14 okay so we pushed through but
40:07 then I get to California 87 88 89 just
40:11 fantasy world even 90 was pretty damn
40:13 awesome but 91 ooh
40:17 life got different George Bush senior's
40:21 about to finish his term destroying the
40:23 world Reagan taxes all such stuff you
40:27 know not he's got dark that he's got
40:29 dark 21st century is sort of this weird
40:32 you know I don't know we've had terror
40:35 war on terror now for 20 years thank God
40:39 Trump is stopping that but at the same
40:41 time we have sort of the most pop
40:42 culture we've ever had your Gaga's in
40:46 your Katy Perry's and it was all this
40:48 auto-tune crap some people try to keep
40:52 it real but I you know I think I didn't
40:55 mention this but when I was Electronic
40:57 Arts we were trying to build something
40:59 massive a 320 million dollar website I
41:03 did the initial architecture then I had
41:06 another buddy of mine who got heard
41:07 about about a year later he came in to
41:09 do the other party architecture you know
41:11 I became real good friends were still
41:13 friends his day but it was rough and it
41:17 was hard and we saw gobs of waste
41:21 don't went around just millions of
41:23 dollars getting shoveled out the door
41:26 for useless consulting firms that were
41:29 just bold-faced Liars bad contracts and
41:32 eventually all that negativity kind of
41:34 pulled together some really mmm not so
41:39 amazing employees got some pretty high
41:41 positions because they had done various
41:44 things on the side to get those
41:45 positions I'll let you fill in the
41:47 blanks and it ended up by September 11th
41:53 I should say September 10th let's just
41:55 say it was really dark and there was all
41:58 these rumors sites writing really
42:00 horrible things about the company I mean
42:04 it got so bad that you know I had an
42:07 associate that got utterly destroyed
42:11 online
42:12 and she actually was told by my boss who
42:17 was a total [ __ ] at the time that I
42:21 probably wrote it about her I mean just
42:23 an amazing lie that caused just true he
42:27 was like a [ __ ] Iago that guy but he
42:30 really polluted her brain and made her
42:32 think I did it now unbeknownst to her I
42:34 was being attacked outside the company
42:36 completely because someone randomly
42:38 found my personal website and they gave
42:42 me the wink err of the week award in
42:44 England and then some people from EA UK
42:47 who I knew a lot of people in UK I must
42:49 not have known these people didn't know
42:51 who I was and they were jumping on the
42:54 bandwagon and they were talking about
42:55 getting me fired and it's just it was
42:57 just a bunch of bull ships just a bunch
42:59 of people grief of me for about a month
43:01 or whatever and you know I was I was
43:04 shocked but I was like this is the
43:07 experience being online it was like
43:08 getting trolled in what 88 98 by 2000
43:13 2001
43:13 yeah sorry 2001 so my boss actually came
43:17 up to me and told me that he told her
43:19 that I did it he accused me of it right
43:21 in my face and like dude and I go why do
43:25 you think I did it and he goes because
43:26 they yelled about me in there and they
43:28 never talked bad about you okay so maybe
43:34 I'm you're saying I'm actually a
43:37 horrible person and they just decided to
43:39 not say anything about me it's sort of
43:41 what the backhanded thing was I need to
43:43 talk about a lot of people it was just
43:45 stupid but I had to take this woman and
43:47 I said you know I went right to her I
43:49 didn't let a minute pass you know and I
43:50 said look we need to talk really fast
43:52 like whenever you got a second like
43:54 today and she was really kind about it
43:57 and she sat down and I don't think she
43:59 entirely believed what I was telling her
44:02 which is so sad
44:05 I had to tell her across the table I
44:07 said look I I've only read a little bit
44:11 of this stuff because someone forwarded
44:13 a piece of it to me it it's atrocious I
44:15 don't have any time to write this crap I
44:17 don't put that negative energy out there
44:19 I have nothing to do with this thing
44:21 about you I know this in you is trying
44:24 to hold it around
44:26 and I think I even said that's his name
44:29 by the way I said look that dude is it
44:31 as a writer that's what he is in real
44:33 life that's his profession he was a
44:35 writer and editor or not an editor maybe
44:37 what a cover article in Time magazine
44:39 like he's the writer accusing me of
44:42 writing something about you you know a
44:44 little bit of ironic irony there right
44:47 turned out that once they laid off the
44:50 first 350 people one of her employees
44:55 I suspect was probably the person who
44:58 wrote it because he flipped out in his
45:00 cube and he was all into conspiracies
45:02 and stuff like crazy ones like he
45:05 thought our badges were two-way
45:06 communication things and I had I had
45:11 taken advantage of the fact that our
45:15 group was called front-end development
45:16 what's the acronym Fed so I created like
45:20 these federal like SWAT team jackets you
45:22 know with FA D on the back and I created
45:24 a I took a sheriff's badge I had found
45:26 scanned online and went into Photoshop
45:28 and cleaned it all up put our logo in
45:30 there put it on the front and then we
45:32 had stickers made that we would put on
45:34 things that were our property and our
45:36 pictures would print out big giant
45:38 30-inch you know plotter pictures of
45:40 what we were making which are gorgeous
45:42 websites to put these badges or he put
45:44 them in the artwork anyway he was like
45:46 see I nice guy's a Fed and he was just
45:49 nuts and he had to be dragged out by
45:53 security I mean every some people get
45:55 escorted by security but they don't
45:56 cause any issues it's just a matter of
45:58 protocol this dude was yelling screaming
46:00 and yelling about her Connor all these
46:02 names I wasn't there when it happened
46:04 but it was the day of and my employees
46:07 were like act it was freaky mints do you
46:08 started screaming and yelling I thought
46:10 we didn't know he's gonna kill anybody
46:11 or whatever this before mass events
46:13 right so I'm like there and her and he
46:16 was a community dude so he was a you
46:19 know a writer and it was like he's out
46:20 there trolling websites and stuff trying
46:23 to develop community for us right and he
46:25 must have just dropped this off but
46:26 anyway everything got dark everything
46:31 personal stuff get dark
46:33 the company got dark
46:35 we're trying to succeed we're working
46:37 our or working around the clock I mean
46:39 we're working to the point we don't
46:40 sleep anymore I mean we did but it was
46:42 rough and then this 911 thing happens
46:47 and then all the other stuff happened
46:50 after that right the economy crashes
46:52 we're losing our company our deal with
46:55 AOL and South because they lied and so I
47:00 feel like you know did I crawl over into
47:04 that other dimension because I are
47:05 created in this world because I was
47:08 feeling it and my program simply goes
47:11 okay he's being negative we'll give him
47:12 all the negativity once he's feeling
47:15 really negative okay what can we give
47:17 them that's a mind-blowing negative
47:18 moment boom this terrorist attack
47:22 happens and changes the entire world it
47:24 was like you know when that moment
47:26 happened you we all walked through a
47:27 barrier didn't and we got a comment we
47:31 had to crawl back through that Stargate
47:33 go back to our world before that
47:35 [ __ ]
47:36 change happened right now let me ask you
47:41 I'll bring that up because well how many
47:46 other times would that happen if you
47:48 lived a long time let's just say a long
47:50 time so pretty nasty crap has happened
47:54 all over the world especially in Europe
47:55 but the whole history of Europe and I'm
47:57 not saying anything specifically bad
47:59 about Europe but think about it we've
48:00 had a lot of action over there we've had
48:02 Caesar's and we've had Catholic churches
48:04 and Crusades and we've had you know
48:07 people you know had their heads
48:10 guillotined off including the guy that
48:13 invented the guillotine and his head cut
48:14 off by it
48:15 ironic but we've reward and we've Ward
48:20 there's the story of Joe right
48:22 I mentioned it every once in a while and
48:24 they're the psychological thing that has
48:27 never explained in the story of Job is
48:29 that God you know he was kind of a dick
48:32 in that story makes his bet with the
48:34 devil devil gets to destroy all of jobs
48:37 everything is crops his wife his
48:40 children they all die he's completely by
48:43 himself and he doesn't turn away his
48:46 turns back on God
48:48 well then he does it again the devil
48:52 does it again God allows I gotta get
48:53 wasted one more time and then finally
48:56 after two times God says re and Nath
48:59 enough you see he doesn't change his
49:00 faith towards me you can go away now and
49:03 then the way they tell the story is that
49:05 God gave him everything again more
49:07 children a wife or wife and more
49:08 children crops all that good stuff it's
49:11 all good but the truth of the matter
49:13 that's never explained because it is a
49:15 fictional story is that his
49:18 psychological damage would be so
49:20 unbelievable he'd be in a padded room
49:22 somewhere he would be utterly mentally
49:26 incapable of trusting the third round of
49:29 things because at any minute in his life
49:32 in his psyche it's all gonna be taken
49:35 away again so don't get click too close
49:38 to your children don't get too close to
49:40 your wife because they're all gonna go
49:42 away all right that's started Joe if you
49:48 live 300 years you would be job if they
49:52 didn't live 300 years with you let me
49:56 ask you this when you think about living
49:57 forever do you think about everyone else
49:59 living forever with you I don't mean
50:01 maybe forever but a really long time do
50:04 you want I mean you know at some point
50:05 everything that's being postponed will
50:07 come to pass your death if you don't
50:13 live forever will come and then what are
50:17 you gonna do you're gonna be afraid of
50:18 death you'd be ready for death let's say
50:21 that you you even skip a few generations
50:24 of your own family you you have several
50:27 different wife's maybe because you can't
50:32 be with one person for 300 years who the
50:34 hell knows she lives 200 years - can you
50:36 do it can you live forever with somebody
50:38 maybe can maybe can talk about growing
50:42 apart
50:43 damn that algorithm would mean a
50:45 completely different thing if you lived
50:47 even 200 years especially if she did -
50:52 I'm always going for the male
50:53 perspective I do apologize ladies just
50:55 flip the genders or whatever gender you
50:58 like - you associate with but the
51:03 goal of this episode is to get us to
51:06 think about this and a much more healthy
51:08 manner in my opinion now am I trying to
51:12 get you to a point when someone passes
51:13 you're like yeah whatever you die
51:15 whatever hell no hell no it'll never
51:20 happen anyway but I would make that the
51:22 objective anyway you know the whole
51:24 thing about dying is sort of like well
51:27 you don't want to die young because you
51:28 have more things you want to do we
51:29 talked about this several times but at
51:32 some point our bodies will start giving
51:35 away in almost completely randomly
51:37 different ways isn't that interesting
51:39 rate well how'd they pass away and it's
51:42 always a different story unfortunately
51:44 cancer because of our society today and
51:47 how we adopt so much toxicity in at
51:49 least America and we ignore all the
51:52 cures to it again
51:54 temporary cures for the current instance
51:56 you have you must clean up your diets in
51:59 order to not have a relapse but honestly
52:02 take certain medicines every single day
52:04 vitamins you treat yourself well they
52:06 probably never died that particular
52:07 thing but at some point you know a tube
52:11 in your brain will just fatigue and
52:13 collapse and you'll be done a good
52:16 friend of mine just had a stroke about
52:18 six months ago and he isn't part of the
52:22 film special effects group he is 76 last
52:28 of last month he's a brilliant man he
52:33 has been amazing his entire life and he
52:37 is celebrated by everyone in special
52:39 effects as being sort of the godfather
52:42 of pretty much cg in terms of being one
52:46 of the first dudes to really embrace it
52:48 hardcore and make movies like Tron and
52:51 he is obviously completely sentient he
52:55 just lost partial movement in his left
52:57 side he's rehabilitating right now and
52:59 taking it very very seriously and for
53:01 those of you don't know you know when
53:03 you he taught me this that when you do
53:05 have a stroke your first year
53:06 rehabilitation is your most important
53:08 year because after a year your ability
53:12 to regain anything diminishes
53:16 significantly so you really really
53:18 really need to push it in those first 12
53:21 months and he is he's following all the
53:23 all the advice but he told me he has had
53:28 an amazing spiritual experience without
53:30 any drugs I mean he and I are the ones
53:34 that drop acid together he's like one of
53:37 my best friends in the whole world but
53:40 he I picked him up to go to CID service
53:46 and he was telling me you know you told
53:49 me days before this whole thing happened
53:52 it's its thing but he told me he goes
53:53 look I don't just see anyone anymore
53:55 like I used to he goes I see someone's
54:00 spiritual force I see their whole being
54:03 which is very similar to some of the
54:05 visual effects you see in the movie Lucy
54:07 with Scarlett Johansson when she was on
54:10 that drug and she went outside you have
54:11 talked about it a couple times she just
54:13 saw the ether all life force moving
54:16 through all things sort of exactly what
54:19 he described to me which in one level is
54:22 is wonderful he's having this amazing
54:25 epiphany this amazing profound daily
54:29 second to second experience as a result
54:31 of incurring something that will most
54:33 likely leave him was some form of
54:35 handicap for the rest of his life so he
54:39 really made some sweet-ass lemonade for
54:41 him some pretty sour lemons you know and
54:45 if I wasn't making this show I probably
54:47 wouldn't have understood a lot of things
54:48 he said and I probably would have to
54:50 send to his level of consciousness to
54:53 experience what he's experiencing but
54:55 because we share all of our thoughts and
54:57 I have pierced every cork in my
55:01 consciousness to make these episodes I
55:03 feel like I'm there with him I feel like
55:05 I was there back in 2013 and I've
55:07 documented it in episodes where I sat at
55:09 the beach with my little book and I
55:11 looked out and I started visioning
55:13 everyone as life beings and then I
55:15 started watching how we as little blips
55:18 of life force grouped together and clump
55:20 together it's very interesting if you
55:22 just look at a when you people watch you
55:24 publicly think about it not so much in
55:26 an airport where no one knows and eat
55:27 each other but look at a number
55:30 we have friends and family members all
55:33 getting together random strangers that
55:35 don't want to be alone who go up and
55:37 talk to someone just to have a
55:39 conversation the name of the game is to
55:44 to not fantasize about living forever
55:47 and less perhaps you're writing a story
55:49 that needs that sort of narrative but to
55:54 really work at appreciating what you
55:57 have at every level of detail and I
56:02 think it has to do with not only mutual
56:05 experiences that you share with other
56:06 people which the more intelligence did
56:08 you get the more isolated you will
56:10 become in life and thus those
56:12 conversations will be tougher to have
56:13 than any level of satisfaction which is
56:16 why I made this show and I found all you
56:18 that way we could have them together
56:20 right I think one of the biggest
56:23 questions we can ask at this point in
56:24 the conversation is what does it mean to
56:26 be alive what is what is being alive
56:30 what is it is it just having a heartbeat
56:34 being on a respirator what is it a very
56:38 interesting thing happened a friend of
56:39 Mines father is dying of Parkinson's
56:42 he's in his early 80s and he's starting
56:45 to get to the point where the
56:45 Parkinson's is starting to make it
56:47 difficult to breathe and so they had to
56:50 do a tracheotomy on him to solve the
56:53 problem once and for all but they gave
56:56 him an option of putting the putting his
57:00 father in a respirator and then a doctor
57:04 said don't do that don't put you down on
57:08 a respirator he said why he said because
57:11 that's the end of his life the idea is
57:15 that you think you can have a respirator
57:17 which it means they put a giant tube
57:18 from your mouth down into your to your
57:21 lungs and they keep you alive right they
57:24 pump oxygen into you and the notion is
57:26 is that you think you're gonna be able
57:27 to be upright and get work in your
57:30 computer and writing things down or
57:32 whatever mm-hmm you're on your back
57:36 maybe staring at the ceiling and then
57:39 the problem is you typically lose all of
57:41 your capabilities in that state
57:43 you fully atrophy down to nothing and
57:45 then you're alive because the machines
57:47 keeping you alive and now a family
57:49 member has to turn you off and this
57:53 doctor who puts people in respirators
57:57 said I did that to my father and then I
58:01 had to take him off of it and he goes it
58:03 haunts me every single day but I had to
58:06 turn him off and it's interesting to her
58:09 doctor have that emotional experience
58:11 because doctors are seeing life and
58:14 death constantly but when it was
58:17 personalized it it really hit him hard
58:20 no I'm not saying I'm not giving you any
58:23 medical advice whatsoever you got a
58:25 young person who's going through a
58:27 serious injury I would do it no matter
58:30 what keep them alive because they're
58:32 probably gonna heal up and they're gonna
58:33 eventually wake up and we'll be okay for
58:35 someone in Hospice it might be a
58:37 slightly different consideration I think
58:41 that one of the things that plagues some
58:44 folks is this notion of kind of leaving
58:46 a mark on the world leaving something
58:48 behind that is never gonna be forgotten
58:51 so you're like okay I'll be dead but my
58:53 paintings will be hanging here my music
58:55 will be played on the radio and it is a
58:58 fascinating thing when that happens when
59:01 someone actually does create that let's
59:03 take some four instances right when will
59:08 Bach Mozart and Beethoven cease to be
59:11 played when Will Shakespeare ceased to
59:15 be performed when will we stop looking
59:18 at you know Michelangelo Leonardo
59:22 Picasso
59:24 Rembrandt when will we stop looking at
59:26 these paintings of course I'm excluding
59:29 99.9% of all amazing people it will be
59:35 potentially for those examples I just
59:39 gave which is some really high-end cream
59:42 on the crop cream on the top the
59:45 examples that have already survived
59:47 hundreds and thousands of years of
59:50 weathering think about Egypt
59:55 when will those pyramids cease to amaze
59:57 man never and so you can get caught up
60:04 in these algorithms of purpose and hey
60:08 maybe it's a I'm not here to tell you
60:10 not to man quite frankly do it because
60:13 I'll probably love your stuff too some
60:16 people could think that's what it means
60:18 to be alive you know to strive for this
60:20 indelible mark on society on the world
60:24 what I like about classical music
60:27 Shakespeare fine art and a wonder of the
60:33 world being the Great Pyramids is it as
60:37 global everybody gets it doesn't matter
60:41 where you're from you take anyone out of
60:44 a jungle probably especially out of a
60:47 jungle imagine this this is a great
60:49 example right let's go to Peru let's go
60:53 the rainforest let's grab a tribe it's
60:55 never ever met man and we'll define that
60:59 by the fact they don't have some
61:00 appliance that somebody's given them
61:02 from the mainland you know the populated
61:06 areas and then let's get the most
61:08 brilliant architects structural engineer
61:12 so we take one male or female from one
61:16 and one male and female from the other
61:17 maybe take one of each now we put them
61:20 right in front of the Great Pyramid of
61:22 Giza can we say behold what do you think
61:27 about that the scientific folks are
61:31 gonna be like well Amen
61:33 2.3 million rocks stacked up in a way
61:35 that we can't figure out how they did it
61:37 we've got some fairies but they're all
61:39 crap amazing look at all the engineering
61:42 that was around whenever these things
61:43 were built
61:44 I see pie I see Pythagoras there I sell
61:48 kinds of structural integrity issues
61:49 that they figured out I see a 50 foot
61:53 150 ton rock with less than a five
61:56 hundredths of an inch deviation down the
61:58 whole line of this stone then you have
62:03 the primitives quote-unquote looking up
62:05 going
62:08 this just blows my mind you know you
62:11 touch a rock and they tried to move it
62:12 they're like oh my god that's really
62:13 huge or maybe they maybe they whistle a
62:17 phrase and when the rock starts floating
62:18 away you know maybe they're like eh
62:20 whatever isn't that interesting that
62:23 that's sort of a global phenomenon there
62:29 is a metric there that we never really
62:31 talk about it's a form of living forever
62:34 isn't it
62:36 what is the Pharaohs belief the Pharaohs
62:39 belief as long as their name is spoken
62:42 they will live forever well there's a
62:46 lot of pharaohs that are gonna live for
62:47 as long as man is present in the
62:50 universe
62:50 he's originating from this particular
62:52 planet I mean imagine just take it one
62:57 step further especially since I got at
62:59 least a half inch on here we at some
63:05 point the matrix turns off we get sucked
63:07 out of the system now or wherever we
63:10 originated either were human-like or
63:13 we're not or whatever but let's just say
63:15 we're souls floating around the universe
63:17 or something hopefully there's a little
63:19 more tangibility than that in my opinion
63:21 even take the biblical definition of
63:26 heaven we just I don't know quite if
63:27 it's defined as we have had it's
63:30 portrayed in movies throughout the years
63:32 but we're sitting around a table talking
63:37 to each other we get through the the
63:38 basics Howard what did you do last time
63:40 you were there how'd you die whatever
63:42 and then we start to talk about what we
63:44 remember from our lifetimes and maybe
63:46 we're sitting at a table with someone
63:48 who lived in the 1800's someone who
63:50 lived in the BCS and us in the 21st
63:53 century and we start talking about
63:56 things and we because maybe we have
63:59 divine knowledge we could understand
64:01 each other's phrases 21st century
64:04 persons should be able to conceive of
64:05 all the other people's stories but could
64:09 the person in the BCS really understand
64:11 listening to journey at an arcade in
64:14 Derby Kansas and the amazing sound of
64:18 space invaders thump on the ground while
64:20 someone is
64:21 keep Ewing the asteroids next to you or
64:25 killing that little flea that falls down
64:27 in centipede does our subjectiveness
64:29 follow us around what I would our
64:33 subjectiveness work with living forever
64:38 you really like journey love and touchin
64:43 squeezin right you really like video
64:45 games you really like whatever and then
64:49 what do you think 100 years from now
64:51 this is silly horse is still in dearie
64:54 does it turn into more of a symbol of
64:56 memory of a wonderful time when you were
64:59 younger
65:00 does your youth and adolescence spread
65:02 out or rebirth if you lived 300 years at
65:06 150 do you go back to being 15 again
65:09 you'd imagine if our actual physical age
65:12 swayed it like a sine cosine wave never
65:16 quite going back to obvious infancy
65:18 imagine that we got he's a baby again
65:21 he's one of the smartest kids in the
65:23 school I'm trying to make an episode
65:26 where that cathartic moment we find out
65:32 that we've lost some someone especially
65:34 because there's nothing more valuable
65:35 than a person nothing more valuable than
65:39 a person and we don't talk about it
65:43 right you know some people what was it
65:46 okay so I'll give you one it was a very
65:48 pleasant thing that occurred that I
65:51 hadn't really imagined when Sid was not
65:54 doing terribly well as last year of life
65:56 although he really looked like he was
65:58 making a recovery and then all of a
65:59 sudden it was like poof what you need to
66:02 realize that that can happen as well I
66:04 did want to ask him a couple things you
66:08 know I wanted to ask him about you know
66:12 what were his plans after passing is he
66:15 going to be cremated it will he be
66:16 buried is he going back to some place in
66:19 Michigan or something and it kind of was
66:21 a transient kid cuz his dad was a
66:23 preacher ended up being cremated and
66:27 earned and entombed you know in this
66:30 amazing place
66:32 and they gave him some options this is
66:36 so so Sid this is like I was so happy
66:40 inside this kind of mausoleum place you
66:43 know he put all those into mints in
66:44 those boxes you know they gave those who
66:48 buy places to be he bought a really
66:51 beautiful place with this it's just when
66:54 you walk in the entrance you walk
66:55 straight to it and they gave him two
66:59 options of what they have in the catalog
67:01 one was like a kind of venus de milo
67:03 kind of character if I remember right
67:05 and the other one was like a Roman
67:07 pillar with those you know those sort of
67:12 what you call them the grooves that go
67:14 down the column right and of course said
67:17 well yeah I'm gonna have one design I'll
67:20 design one and then I'll have it made
67:21 and so he did this unbelievable thing he
67:26 created this futuristic pillar that kind
67:29 of looks like like a single petal had
67:33 bloomed at the bottom and then the rest
67:35 of it was like the smooth capsule of a
67:37 of a of a pillar and then we didn't
67:41 realize this and so afterwards he had
67:44 had it mounted in this little inset
67:48 thing such that it looks like it's
67:49 floating sit he's just that white men
67:54 utterly brilliant had it all planned out
67:56 it was already there before he passed
67:59 must have paid a pretty penny for it too
68:02 but I also wanted to ask him the
68:04 question because he's so scientific I
68:06 wanted to ask him you know are you gonna
68:09 try to come back and visit us because I
68:12 had that experience of Walt Disney I
68:14 thought well I I know this is the way it
68:17 works I don't give a [ __ ] what anyone
68:19 else thinks I knows the way it works so
68:21 are you gonna do it come to find out his
68:27 partner asked him that question I guess
68:31 without batting an eye I don't know if
68:33 I've said this in episode if I have I
68:34 apologize probably means more in this
68:36 episode than anything but he is said
68:39 just just instantaneously he was like
68:42 when you see the unicorn that's me
68:46 now let's rewind a little bit here
68:49 unicorn well I've been at SIDS house
68:52 there's no unicorns in the whole place
68:54 there's all kinds of other things
68:56 repeated all over the place that he
68:58 loves no unicorns but now what project
69:02 did he work on where unicorn was a very
69:04 important character Bladerunner gaff
69:09 folded a unicorn in the last scene when
69:13 Deckard finds out he's a replicant but
69:17 he also had the vision of the unicorn
69:19 which was cut from Ridley Scott's movie
69:22 legend with Tom Cruise that he cut it
69:24 into Blade Runner and he gave decorative
69:26 vision when he was falling asleep I
69:27 believe on the piano of seeing a unicorn
69:30 and then of course gaff folds of the
69:32 unicorn at the indicee I know you have
69:33 this implant in your memory so I'm
69:35 telling you that your replicant and of
69:39 course gaps line is repeated at the end
69:40 of the film which was utterly brilliant
69:42 too bad she won't live but then again
69:46 who does meaning she'll die will die
69:52 like all of us whenever we do die not a
69:55 two-year limit right so his partner said
69:59 to me the SIDS favorite show was The
70:03 Simpsons and he said that he turned it
70:08 on just to kind of do what they did I
70:12 mean I would've been bawling my brains
70:14 out if this was like my girlfriend my
70:15 wife's favorite show I'm doing it within
70:19 a week of her passing but anyway
70:21 the show's going in the middle of the
70:23 episode he said there was a unicorn and
70:26 he said the funny thing was the
70:28 interesting thing was is it wasn't part
70:29 of the story it wasn't used as a prop
70:33 for a joke it was just there and there
70:37 you go don't know
70:43 that seems pretty amazing doesn't it so
70:46 let me know if you've ever had the
70:47 thought of least living a lot longer
70:52 than you live down and what were your
70:53 objectives when you had that thought and
70:56 let me know if you think about the ones
70:59 around you living with you that the same
71:05 slowed down pace let me know if you've
71:09 had the thought of being cursed with
71:11 being immortal and if you think it's a
71:15 curse why if you don't think it's a
71:18 curse why I guess one of the best
71:21 questions I could ask you rhetorically
71:24 is to say when's the last time you
71:27 called someone that you loved and told
71:30 them that you love them because you
71:32 haven't said it in a while the friend
71:35 the family remember whatever the only
71:39 thing I was gonna say it Syd's services
71:45 that no one else said was that the one
71:52 thing I don't think that we ever thanked
71:54 people for even though it's implied is
72:00 we don't thank people for inviting us
72:03 into their lives to share their lives
72:07 with them and Sid and Roger invited me
72:15 in their lives 20 years ago and I loved
72:18 every single second of it I mean there
72:21 was never a negative moment around me
72:23 with those guys definitely not between
72:26 us or between them I mean it was
72:27 euphoric it was fantastic
72:30 and that's one thing I wanted to to say
72:36 but of course you know you know these
72:40 are things I would have definitely said
72:41 this said had I known he was at the door
72:46 but I didn't say it and I don't think
72:48 you know there's anything he can hear me
72:50 say it today so he's good
72:53 there's something about saying it to
72:54 someone right before they go the only
72:59 time I've ever this experience and then
73:00 I'll close off this episode is I've said
73:03 this once before but since we're on this
73:04 this sort of moment I had a very very
73:09 good friend of mine and just a guy
73:11 looked up to like crazy pass in his 40s
73:14 think it's about 46 when he passed of
73:16 just a spontaneous brain tumor out of
73:19 thin air no history of cancer and his
73:21 family whatsoever and I used to go back
73:27 and visit my hometown every fourth of
73:29 July and invited him to my fourth of
73:33 July in 2001 they agreed to come over
73:36 because I was go to their house and it's
73:38 been hours and hours and days visiting
73:39 them and they agreed and then the fourth
73:42 of July comes and they don't show up and
73:44 I'm like if it's really weird so I went
73:46 over their house and I'm looking in the
73:48 windows and they're not there and I
73:49 thought well they got family members all
73:50 over the place maybe they just forgot or
73:52 whatever just decided to do it well the
73:56 truth was he had a grand mal seizure two
73:58 days earlier and he was in a cancer ward
74:01 either in Houston or Wichita or
74:03 something like that he was in bad shape
74:04 I didn't find out until I got back home
74:07 I was totally bummed and then I was
74:10 extra bummed to find out that he had
74:11 this issue but then again I didn't know
74:13 it was gonna be incurable life
74:16 threatening against 2000 wanted knew
74:17 nothing about alternate methods of
74:19 healing and so when I went back the next
74:22 year they had told me he's still life
74:25 he'd had at least one procedure on his
74:28 tumors but they said look man this stuff
74:31 super aggressive it doubles in size
74:32 every 40 days he said I don't want any
74:37 more surgeries I don't want any more
74:38 drugs except for ones to get rid of the
74:41 pain which must have been like headaches
74:43 or something but he was a big strong
74:46 dude right it's sort of like that that
74:50 rock creature and never the neverending
74:53 story right the one that said he was big
74:57 strong literally a mountain of rock and
75:00 he was looking at the nothing that was
75:02 coming and he said you know
75:05 something to the effect I've got these
75:07 big strong hands
75:09 there's nothing I can do that was my
75:14 buddy it makes me emotional they get
75:17 better right now you know this was the
75:19 dude I supposed to grow old with you
75:20 know you gotta teach me how to fix
75:25 Harley's and old trucks and so we were
75:28 supposed to be doing with our lives at
75:31 least at this point but I got to go to
75:34 him you know and I was relatively
75:38 cognizant of this world at that point I
75:41 was like 32 or so and I just told him I
75:48 said look you know cuz he was sort of
75:51 drugged out a little bit but he was
75:52 fully aware but he was just sort of his
75:55 motor mechanics weren't there because
75:56 his brain had been damaged and he was
76:00 just this big burly dude man and that's
76:04 just hard to watch you know and I just
76:08 told him I said look because he couldn't
76:11 really talk back to me it was sort of
76:14 mumbly you know I said look when I told
76:18 him I loved him but I told him I think
76:23 the one thing that boys want to
76:30 accomplish in our lifetime it's becoming
76:34 a decent man that's our goal
76:38 and I told him that he did it he made it
76:48 and then I gave him a hug
76:50 and he gave me a hug back and then I
76:54 left and I'm looking back at the big
76:59 comfy chair he was sitting in he's
77:01 watching TV he's got his kids there and
77:04 his wife and I knew the second I turned
77:11 my head to walk away that was it I would
77:15 never see him again
77:18 I think within 30 days being being back
77:21 home he had passed and I just think what
77:26 a shame and all that mentorship just
77:31 floated away with his soul because it's
77:35 one thing to walk in someone's footsteps
77:37 you know I could go off and learn the
77:40 things that I know that I'd want to
77:41 learn with him maybe I'll find someone
77:45 like that in my life you know I have
77:47 found amazing people trust me of course
77:50 they've taught me different things that
77:52 are amazing but it's it's the style of
77:56 that person that made it special for me
78:00 because every time I visit him he'd take
78:01 me in as garage that he built with his
78:03 own hands and which is big warehouse
78:07 kind of garage and he'd uh he'd have a
78:10 Harley there something he'd have a two
78:12 bikes usually one that he's finishing up
78:13 when he's about to work on he'd pulled
78:15 it
78:16 you know big you know tarp off of one of
78:18 them and he'd say this is my new one man
78:20 you know and he's very soft-spoken guy
78:23 could have it a like an old truck up on
78:26 blocks just all taken apart you know you
78:29 just fixing one little panel at a time
78:31 one little thing looking for a part here
78:33 and there you know and it just really
78:39 made me re-evaluate everything that I
78:44 have and it may be really really myself
78:50 as a person because you know maybe I'm
78:54 mad for other people I mean I do have a
78:55 kid try to be that to her of course and
78:58 I'm sure over time that'll just become
79:00 more significant to her but you know
79:03 taking care of yourself not getting into
79:06 risky situations for no reason not
79:08 losing your cool to blow up your life
79:10 you know it's because in moments like
79:13 that that life is precious man that's
79:17 how I know it's precious is because I
79:19 lived through that loss and I don't
79:20 think his soul is the slightest bit did
79:23 you know I think he's floating around
79:25 I've never had any experience with him
79:27 but I know of like you know coming back
79:29 to say hi or something
79:32 perhaps he has and I missed it but you
79:37 know I don't know if you live forever
79:38 here would you get to a point where
79:41 you'd have an argument with someone you
79:42 love that you never wanted to have
79:44 because you live forever and you just
79:45 get eventually get so frustrated maybe
79:47 you just become numb and he and I
79:50 already sitting on a porch looking at
79:51 traffic go by we're like 400 years old
79:55 maybe that's bliss maybe it's nothing
79:58 knows right anyway I wanted to heighten
80:02 your awareness of this I wanted to
80:06 record my own emotions well they're very
80:09 very fresh and I hope this is valuable
80:12 to you I do appreciate you
80:16 I know it's always impersonal because
80:18 it's over the Internet and you know I
80:20 don't know you 99% of you I don't know
80:22 and for those of you I've talked to or
80:26 mad or whatever I get a tiny slice of
80:29 you but we're sharing this journey
80:32 together right you really are so just in
80:39 closing you know have have that those
80:42 questions give me your answers and
80:44 wherever you want to give them to me
80:46 I'll do a short bumper today because I
80:49 think I've been beaten that up please
80:51 like and subscribe
80:52 I always forget to say that like the
80:55 people that really pound it into your
80:56 head they do get a lot of subscriptions
80:58 and they do it right from the beginning
80:59 of the episode my style is to earn it
81:02 and then see what happens right but deep
81:06 thoughts radio.com is where everything
81:08 is there's video audio there's social
81:12 media there's a couple of ways to donate
81:14 a couple products I just like it I refer
81:16 to you guys that make no money off of
81:18 them there's a store for season five
81:22 t-shirts I'm actually getting mine in
81:24 here shortly so you'll start seeing me
81:26 wearing them myself
81:27 and then there is channel all dedicated
81:31 to season one which you won't find on
81:33 this particular channel because they
81:35 were all remastered much much better
81:37 some of them significantly shorter so
81:40 get up there if you want to see the
81:41 first hundred
81:42 plus a couple special reports is anyway
81:46 tell someone you love them take a minute
81:50 out of your life to meditate on this
81:52 whole subject matter bring yourself some
81:54 peace and and take care of yourself and
81:59 someone else because I will see you in
82:02 the next deep thoughts over now
